00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 align:start position:0%
good morning everybody
 
00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 align:start position:0%
um the education committee is ready to
 
00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 align:start position:0%
go ahead and start hearing bills today
 
00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 align:start position:0%
uh what I would like to do is just
 
00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 align:start position:0%
beforehand give you a little update on
 
00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 align:start position:0%
how many bills we do have and what's
 
00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 align:start position:0%
happened in the last 24 hours
 
00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 align:start position:0%
we have a total now of 91 bills
 
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 align:start position:0%
last night I vacated 564. that's a bill
 
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
that came to this committee
 
00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 align:start position:0%
and it dealt with the state building
 
00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 align:start position:0%
code and the state fire code
 
00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 align:start position:0%
and why that came to education
 
00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 align:start position:0%
I don't know but we no longer have that
 
00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 align:start position:0%
and that's going to the proper uh
 
00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 align:start position:0%
committee we do have two new bills 651
 
00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 align:start position:0%
and 654. one deals with Alternative
 
00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:38.879 align:start position:0%
forms of transportation to and from
 
00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
school and the other deals with the
 
00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 align:start position:0%
one-year certification for uh teachers
 
00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 align:start position:0%
which could be extended at two years
 
00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
that was the late bill which we had
 
00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 align:start position:0%
approval from rules to enter and so that
 
00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 align:start position:0%
one is now on our list too so 651 and
 
00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 align:start position:0%
654 are added to our our list of bills
 
00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 align:start position:0%
so that told us uh not 91 bills there is
 
00:03:04.369 --> 00:03:04.379 align:start position:0%
one bill out there that has not been
 
00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 align:start position:0%
assigned I don't know the number I don't
 
00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 align:start position:0%
know what the content's all about maybe
 
00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 align:start position:0%
we can have a lottery to see if that is
 
00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 align:start position:0%
one for education or some other
 
00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 align:start position:0%
committee like AG I don't know but it
 
00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 align:start position:0%
could be fun so with that I'd like to
 
00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 align:start position:0%
get in today's hearings I will be
 
00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 align:start position:0%
presenting the first three bills myself
 
00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 align:start position:0%
so I will have represent cordelli
 
00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 align:start position:0%
running the meeting in the morning here
 
00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 align:start position:0%
when we introduce see spells and so I'm
 
00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 align:start position:0%
going to just remove myself from the you
 
00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 align:start position:0%
know chair here and get set the
 
00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 align:start position:0%
introduce uh 419 here's the gavel
 
00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh the first bill
 
00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 align:start position:0%
we will hear this morning is House Bill
 
00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 align:start position:0%
419 relative to the math learning
 
00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
communities program of the community
 
00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819 align:start position:0%
college system and making an
 
00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:53.159 align:start position:0%
appropriation there for
 
00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 align:start position:0%
we have two speakers thus far and
 
00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:00.110 align:start position:0%
we have two speakers thus far and
um

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 align:start position:0%
chairman Ladd as the prime sponsor will
 
00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:21.139 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:31.800 --> 00:05:01.270 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
good morning to the education committee
 
00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 align:start position:0%
uh for the record my name is Rick Ladd I
 
00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 align:start position:0%
come from Grafton that's now a change
 
00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:11.820 align:start position:0%
District it represents Haverhill Benton
 
00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
Landau Piermont and Warren I'm here
 
00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.000 align:start position:0%
today to introduce
 
00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 align:start position:0%
hb419 this is a bill that deals through
 
00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:21.860 align:start position:0%
the math learning communities program
 
00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:23.759 align:start position:0%
that's offered through the community
 
00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
college system and there's an
 
00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 align:start position:0%
appropriation therefore on this bill so
 
00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
I'd like to walk through a little bit
 
00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 align:start position:0%
very quickly here some of the
 
00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.100 align:start position:0%
information that I noted on the sheet
 
00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
that you probably are now in possession
 
00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.110 align:start position:0%
that you probably are now in possession
of

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:42.479 align:start position:0%
um so let me start
 
00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
the question you might ask is why the
 
00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:48.539 align:start position:0%
why is there a need for uh 419 the math
 
00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:50.940 align:start position:0%
learning communities program this is a
 
00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:52.380 align:start position:0%
program that we started a number of
 
00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:55.199 align:start position:0%
years ago and it was funded through a
 
00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
grant which the community college system
 
00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.129 align:start position:0%
grant which the community college system
had

00:05:58.129 --> 00:05:58.139 align:start position:0%
had
 
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
and the individual in charge that is
 
00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:02.580 align:start position:0%
Beth Doran she's out parking a car right
 
00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:05.820 align:start position:0%
now so she will be testifying also today
 
00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:09.419 align:start position:0%
um the the bill had a purpose and that
 
00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
was to try to address the issue of where
 
00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:14.940 align:start position:0%
we were with teaching of mathematics and
 
00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:16.500 align:start position:0%
the learning of math skills and
 
00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:19.380 align:start position:0%
knowledge throughout K through 12.
 
00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:23.039 align:start position:0%
specifically in the high school
 
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:25.500 align:start position:0%
so in looking at the Box on this sheet
 
00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:28.919 align:start position:0%
that I handed to you there is a box and
 
00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
it has a number of bullets there the
 
00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:32.580 align:start position:0%
first bullet talks about what happened
 
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
back in January 12 with the New
 
00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:37.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire math Task Force if you are
 
00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
came to the legislative oversight
 
00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:41.039 align:start position:0%
committee there was a discussion
 
00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:43.199 align:start position:0%
regarding this this was a task force
 
00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:44.639 align:start position:0%
that was put together by the Department
 
00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:47.100 align:start position:0%
of Education and Paul leather who is the
 
00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:49.080 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner of Education chaired
 
00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:50.940 align:start position:0%
that bringing in Math teachers
 
00:06:53.029 --> 00:06:53.039 align:start position:0%
throughout the state and those other
 
00:06:55.309 --> 00:06:55.319 align:start position:0%
associations which were interested in
 
00:06:57.890 --> 00:06:57.900 align:start position:0%
looking at where we where we were at
 
00:06:59.870 --> 00:06:59.880 align:start position:0%
that time and where we wanted to project
 
00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:02.580 align:start position:0%
ourselves in terms of mathematics
 
00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:04.680 align:start position:0%
mathematics skills and knowledge taught
 
00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:06.360 align:start position:0%
in the schools
 
00:07:08.749 --> 00:07:08.759 align:start position:0%
you can see the quote there that there's
 
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
many quotes and many recommendations
 
00:07:12.529 --> 00:07:12.539 align:start position:0%
well over 20 recommendations that came
 
00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:14.520 align:start position:0%
out of that report some of which we've
 
00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:16.680 align:start position:0%
already adjusted and adopted one of
 
00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:18.780 align:start position:0%
which was embedding mathematics into a
 
00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:20.580 align:start position:0%
fourth year of instruction at the high
 
00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
school we have we have done that
 
00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
so here at New Hampshire must reverse
 
00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:27.900 align:start position:0%
the disturbing trend of poor mathematics
 
00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:29.150 align:start position:0%
the disturbing trend of poor mathematics
performance

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:29.160 align:start position:0%
performance
 
00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
in its high schools and minimize the
 
00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
need for remediation at the
 
00:07:35.749 --> 00:07:35.759 align:start position:0%
post-secondary institutions that was
 
00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:39.720 align:start position:0%
identified back in 2012. we're seeing
 
00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
students going from our high schools
 
00:07:43.909 --> 00:07:43.919 align:start position:0%
into the community college system
 
00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:46.500 align:start position:0%
and over half of those students needed
 
00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
Remediation in mathematics and of that
 
00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:51.720 align:start position:0%
group that needed remediation half never
 
00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:54.060 align:start position:0%
graduated with a two-year ticket
 
00:07:56.930 --> 00:07:56.940 align:start position:0%
from the post-secondary schools so we
 
00:07:58.969 --> 00:07:58.979 align:start position:0%
were certainly observing a difficult
 
00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:01.020 align:start position:0%
situation and one needed support and
 
00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:03.900 align:start position:0%
Improvement back in 2012.
 
00:08:08.029 --> 00:08:08.039 align:start position:0%
in 2013 the house education committee 18
 
00:08:09.969 --> 00:08:09.979 align:start position:0%
members on the committee that were here
 
00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:12.660 align:start position:0%
signed a note communicated to the
 
00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:14.940 align:start position:0%
commissioner of Education that high
 
00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:16.500 align:start position:0%
school students receive math instruction
 
00:08:19.369 --> 00:08:19.379 align:start position:0%
each year while enrolled in secondary
 
00:08:19.379 --> 00:08:20.689 align:start position:0%
each year while enrolled in secondary
education

00:08:20.689 --> 00:08:20.699 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
so we acted on that and put that in the
 
00:08:25.969 --> 00:08:25.979 align:start position:0%
statute and now we have that in place
 
00:08:27.529 --> 00:08:27.539 align:start position:0%
the New England Board of Education
 
00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:30.360 align:start position:0%
higher education it's quote right here
 
00:08:33.409 --> 00:08:33.419 align:start position:0%
savings and earnings benefit benefits
 
00:08:35.810 --> 00:08:35.820 align:start position:0%
from reduced need for Remediation in New
 
00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:37.740 align:start position:0%
Hampshire could benefit the state
 
00:08:41.089 --> 00:08:41.099 align:start position:0%
economy by 16 million dollars we saw all
 
00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:43.260 align:start position:0%
the money which was poured in for these
 
00:08:45.949 --> 00:08:45.959 align:start position:0%
kids taking as students adults taking
 
00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
Remediation in the community college
 
00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:50.580 align:start position:0%
system of which many never made it just
 
00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
think of the dollars and tuition dollars
 
00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
which were lost and didn't really
 
00:08:57.889 --> 00:08:57.899 align:start position:0%
benefit those students and did not
 
00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:01.100 align:start position:0%
benefit our Workforce
 
00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:04.860 align:start position:0%
65 to 70 percent of students planning to
 
00:09:06.829 --> 00:09:06.839 align:start position:0%
attend Community College are unprepared
 
00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:08.580 align:start position:0%
for the first college-level Math course
 
00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:10.860 align:start position:0%
that was stated back there in the years
 
00:09:14.389 --> 00:09:14.399 align:start position:0%
we were talking about 2013-14
 
00:09:18.949 --> 00:09:18.959 align:start position:0%
October 2022 in the Wall Street Journal
 
00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:21.180 align:start position:0%
AC test scores for college admissions
 
00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:25.140 align:start position:0%
fall emissions uh fall for the fifth
 
00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:28.100 align:start position:0%
year in a row this is the first time
 
00:09:30.949 --> 00:09:30.959 align:start position:0%
quote the average score dropped below 20
 
00:09:35.389 --> 00:09:35.399 align:start position:0%
out of 36. since 1991 so we were
 
00:09:38.269 --> 00:09:38.279 align:start position:0%
dropping significantly on the ACT we're
 
00:09:41.389 --> 00:09:41.399 align:start position:0%
also seeing that on the SAT
 
00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:43.980 align:start position:0%
another bullet New Hampshire nape report
 
00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:46.740 align:start position:0%
card October 2022.
 
00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:48.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire students test scores fell
 
00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:51.480 align:start position:0%
during the covet pandemic continuing a
 
00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:54.420 align:start position:0%
long-term decline yes we understand we
 
00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:56.820 align:start position:0%
know that there's many reasons why they
 
00:09:58.850 --> 00:09:58.860 align:start position:0%
dropped during covet
 
00:10:00.769 --> 00:10:00.779 align:start position:0%
if you're not they're getting eyeball to
 
00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
eyeball instruction from your teacher if
 
00:10:03.889 --> 00:10:03.899 align:start position:0%
you're not present if you're learning
 
00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:05.580 align:start position:0%
online if you have that opportunity
 
00:10:08.329 --> 00:10:08.339 align:start position:0%
there was reason and a lot of reasons
 
00:10:11.949 --> 00:10:11.959 align:start position:0%
why the student scores did fall
 
00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
the biggest decline both nationally and
 
00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:16.980 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire was in the eighth grade
 
00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:18.170 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire was in the eighth grade
math

00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:18.180 align:start position:0%
math
 
00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
according to 2022 assessments taken by a
 
00:10:23.329 --> 00:10:23.339 align:start position:0%
sample of students 30 percent of the
 
00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:26.160 align:start position:0%
state's 8th graders and 40 percent of
 
00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:28.440 align:start position:0%
fourth graders are proficient or above
 
00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
in mathematics that came from nhpr
 
00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:33.660 align:start position:0%
and that was a report that was released
 
00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:36.540 align:start position:0%
so we're we we need to have more
 
00:10:38.509 --> 00:10:38.519 align:start position:0%
students proficient and we need to do
 
00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
something about the remediation how we
 
00:10:42.769 --> 00:10:42.779 align:start position:0%
can get things going and we've taken
 
00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:44.700 align:start position:0%
some of the Monies to which we talked
 
00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:47.100 align:start position:0%
about just yesterday the eser monies and
 
00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:49.820 align:start position:0%
applied that to Paris and trying to
 
00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:52.860 align:start position:0%
identify with mathematics programs and a
 
00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
lot of that and excuse me is working we
 
00:10:58.250 --> 00:10:58.260 align:start position:0%
are seeing an increase throughout the
 
00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:01.140 align:start position:0%
state and it might be noted that in all
 
00:11:03.769 --> 00:11:03.779 align:start position:0%
the 50 states we're not we're on the top
 
00:11:03.779 --> 00:11:04.550 align:start position:0%
the 50 states we're not we're on the top
four

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
four
 
00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:07.200 align:start position:0%
so but we're still not where we want to
 
00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:10.440 align:start position:0%
be I can remember when I was first here
 
00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:13.140 align:start position:0%
and I had a friend who was the agent
 
00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
General over at the National Guard here
 
00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
he went to Fort Sill in the class ahead
 
00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:17.640 align:start position:0%
of me
 
00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:20.100 align:start position:0%
and he told me he said Rick
 
00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:22.860 align:start position:0%
when we're looking for people to Young
 
00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:24.660 align:start position:0%
students to get into the National Guard
 
00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:26.820 align:start position:0%
especially in the area of artillery
 
00:11:29.269 --> 00:11:29.279 align:start position:0%
we now look to and it was a combined
 
00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:31.620 align:start position:0%
Battalion between West Virginia and New
 
00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:34.140 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and we looked to get all the
 
00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:36.120 align:start position:0%
technicians from New Hampshire not West
 
00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:38.220 align:start position:0%
Virginia because we believe the students
 
00:11:39.829 --> 00:11:39.839 align:start position:0%
come out have good work ethic and they
 
00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:42.180 align:start position:0%
have better mathematics however we don't
 
00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:43.620 align:start position:0%
have the bar where we want to have the
 
00:11:46.069 --> 00:11:46.079 align:start position:0%
bar yet either
 
00:11:49.269 --> 00:11:49.279 align:start position:0%
48 of students proficient in math 2019
 
00:11:52.009 --> 00:11:52.019 align:start position:0%
38 of students proficient in math in
 
00:11:52.019 --> 00:11:54.050 align:start position:0%
38 of students proficient in math in
2021.

00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:54.060 align:start position:0%
2021.
 
00:11:56.210 --> 00:11:56.220 align:start position:0%
and I have attachments if you look at
 
00:11:59.530 --> 00:11:59.540 align:start position:0%
the attachments back in 14 15 16 and 17
 
00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:02.100 align:start position:0%
we talked about following cohorts
 
00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:06.420 align:start position:0%
yesterday the new on the I uh I research
 
00:12:09.769 --> 00:12:09.779 align:start position:0%
and I platforms we saw how we can now
 
00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:12.240 align:start position:0%
access and follow a cohort of students
 
00:12:14.389 --> 00:12:14.399 align:start position:0%
as fourth graders fifth graders 6th
 
00:12:15.829 --> 00:12:15.839 align:start position:0%
graders seventh graders
 
00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:19.380 align:start position:0%
you can see how this is a rough uh
 
00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:21.540 align:start position:0%
example of what I had you can see what
 
00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:26.160 align:start position:0%
it looked like in the class of 2014. in
 
00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:28.380 align:start position:0%
2010 that class was at the 65th
 
00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:29.750 align:start position:0%
2010 that class was at the 65th
percentile

00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
percentile
 
00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
when they left at the middle school then
 
00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
you jump into the high school level 2013
 
00:12:39.769 --> 00:12:39.779 align:start position:0%
that class same group 37th percentile
 
00:12:41.509 --> 00:12:41.519 align:start position:0%
you can jump through and see what 15
 
00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:43.700 align:start position:0%
looks like also
 
00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
2010 as 7th graders 66.
 
00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:51.240 align:start position:0%
8th graders 65 jumping ninth and 10th
 
00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:52.740 align:start position:0%
because we do not do a state assessment
 
00:12:57.650 --> 00:12:57.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:00.769 --> 00:13:00.779 align:start position:0%
2016 you can track it there sixth
 
00:13:02.449 --> 00:13:02.459 align:start position:0%
graders 72 percent
 
00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:06.240 align:start position:0%
sixth grade 66 percentile 7th grade
 
00:13:11.449 --> 00:13:11.459 align:start position:0%
eighth grade 67th percentile 2015 37th
 
00:13:11.459 --> 00:13:12.650 align:start position:0%
eighth grade 67th percentile 2015 37th
percentile

00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:12.660 align:start position:0%
percentile
 
00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:15.540 align:start position:0%
this trend has been going on we can't
 
00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:18.180 align:start position:0%
kid ourselves saying it's all pandemic
 
00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:20.220 align:start position:0%
related it's not and I think we all know
 
00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:23.100 align:start position:0%
that so how do we and you can look at 17
 
00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:24.720 align:start position:0%
it's the same story there for those
 
00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
students in 17 fifth grade they started
 
00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:29.160 align:start position:0%
the 74th percentile by the time they're
 
00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
taking the SAT it's on the 40th
 
00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
percentile but note that the eighth
 
00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
grade the scores haven't dropped
 
00:13:37.009 --> 00:13:37.019 align:start position:0%
significantly so there's a drop right
 
00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:38.940 align:start position:0%
after the middle the waterfall effect
 
00:13:41.569 --> 00:13:41.579 align:start position:0%
comes after the middle school but in
 
00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
talking with Math teachers I believe
 
00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
that we are also having some issues as
 
00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:48.180 align:start position:0%
we go through the Elementary grades too
 
00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
and that's where it comes there's a
 
00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
number of issues which we want to be
 
00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:55.500 align:start position:0%
looking at as an educator as a teacher
 
00:13:57.470 --> 00:13:57.480 align:start position:0%
as the school principal for years and
 
00:13:59.329 --> 00:13:59.339 align:start position:0%
years too many to count
 
00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:02.820 align:start position:0%
that's that Modern Man to to count we
 
00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:05.100 align:start position:0%
know of all about Maslow's hierarchy we
 
00:14:08.090 --> 00:14:08.100 align:start position:0%
know about Bloom's taxonomy but we also
 
00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:10.260 align:start position:0%
know there's an area called teaching
 
00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
styles and learning styles just because
 
00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
we have kids which are not proficient
 
00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean they can't learn
 
00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:21.660 align:start position:0%
what it means is we perhaps are not
 
00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:24.660 align:start position:0%
teaching and connecting with the student
 
00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:27.480 align:start position:0%
in terms of teaching style and learning
 
00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:28.910 align:start position:0%
in terms of teaching style and learning
style

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
style
 
00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:31.200 align:start position:0%
some people are very visual oriented
 
00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:34.260 align:start position:0%
some people can listen very well I'm
 
00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:35.940 align:start position:0%
more of a visual person
 
00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:39.000 align:start position:0%
and and uh there there's a lot of
 
00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
different ways of learning I'm also very
 
00:14:43.129 --> 00:14:43.139 align:start position:0%
abstract random where my materials if
 
00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
you look at my desk up there sometimes
 
00:14:47.509 --> 00:14:47.519 align:start position:0%
materials are all over it I'm just not
 
00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:49.260 align:start position:0%
that type of organized not a concrete
 
00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:51.560 align:start position:0%
sequential person like some others maybe
 
00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
so what we have done with the math
 
00:14:56.090 --> 00:14:56.100 align:start position:0%
learning communities and this is very
 
00:14:57.590 --> 00:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
very important
 
00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
we developed a process I should say we
 
00:15:03.829 --> 00:15:03.839 align:start position:0%
Beth Dorian and Company at the community
 
00:15:07.069 --> 00:15:07.079 align:start position:0%
college system and working very many
 
00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:09.240 align:start position:0%
long hours to try and present some kind
 
00:15:11.329 --> 00:15:11.339 align:start position:0%
of a program to offer support to the
 
00:15:12.949 --> 00:15:12.959 align:start position:0%
high schools so that we have this
 
00:15:12.959 --> 00:15:14.150 align:start position:0%
high schools so that we have this
transition

00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:14.160 align:start position:0%
transition
 
00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
from secondary to post-secondary where
 
00:15:19.189 --> 00:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
we don't have as much remediation where
 
00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:21.480 align:start position:0%
we have the courses which they come out
 
00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
which will qualify them for uh
 
00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:26.760 align:start position:0%
post-secondary certification in
 
00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:30.540 align:start position:0%
mathematics so what we did we knew that
 
00:15:32.329 --> 00:15:32.339 align:start position:0%
in the 10th grade you're taking algebra
 
00:15:32.339 --> 00:15:33.230 align:start position:0%
in the 10th grade you're taking algebra
one

00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:33.240 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:35.820 align:start position:0%
and following algebra one in the spring
 
00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:38.100 align:start position:0%
well of course is not over yet it was
 
00:15:40.129 --> 00:15:40.139 align:start position:0%
decided that we would give what we call
 
00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
the accuplacer the Next Generation
 
00:15:45.949 --> 00:15:45.959 align:start position:0%
accuplacer which is an assessment very
 
00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:50.220 align:start position:0%
much aligned with the expectations of
 
00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:51.660 align:start position:0%
community college system and
 
00:15:53.269 --> 00:15:53.279 align:start position:0%
post-secondary education in terms of
 
00:15:53.279 --> 00:15:54.610 align:start position:0%
post-secondary education in terms of
mathematics

00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:54.620 align:start position:0%
mathematics
 
00:15:57.350 --> 00:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
we also found out that there's many
 
00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:00.240 align:start position:0%
students that don't learn the way like
 
00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:01.740 align:start position:0%
the learning styles and the teaching
 
00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:05.160 align:start position:0%
styles and there's a fear a fear that's
 
00:16:06.829 --> 00:16:06.839 align:start position:0%
been generated through the Elementary
 
00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
grades right up through so algebra one
 
00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
they're not ready to go on to the other
 
00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:14.220 align:start position:0%
levels of Mathematics algebra 2.
 
00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
but we shouldn't just say well you're
 
00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
not going to make it so we're just going
 
00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:20.160 align:start position:0%
to give you a c and pass you on and they
 
00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:22.380 align:start position:0%
really don't have those skills to really
 
00:16:24.889 --> 00:16:24.899 align:start position:0%
be effective in the workplace
 
00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:27.180 align:start position:0%
so what happened at with that next
 
00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:30.540 align:start position:0%
Generation uh accuplacer test given in
 
00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:33.420 align:start position:0%
the latter part of the algebra 1 to 10th
 
00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:34.370 align:start position:0%
the latter part of the algebra 1 to 10th
grade

00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:34.380 align:start position:0%
grade
 
00:16:36.650 --> 00:16:36.660 align:start position:0%
it was seen that some students didn't
 
00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:39.420 align:start position:0%
score at the level I'm sure that Beth is
 
00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:41.940 align:start position:0%
she here she's behind me great thank you
 
00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:44.100 align:start position:0%
Beth we'll tell you exactly how that
 
00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
worked but the students took this
 
00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:49.620 align:start position:0%
assessment and those is scored at a
 
00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:51.660 align:start position:0%
certain level were seen as they're going
 
00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:54.720 align:start position:0%
to have difficulty with algebra 2 but
 
00:16:57.290 --> 00:16:57.300 align:start position:0%
if we provide another way of teaching
 
00:16:59.810 --> 00:16:59.820 align:start position:0%
another way of learning which applies
 
00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:02.220 align:start position:0%
and establishes how to reason in
 
00:17:05.329 --> 00:17:05.339 align:start position:0%
mathematics how to apply this math and
 
00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
use it in life skills perhaps we can get
 
00:17:10.429 --> 00:17:10.439 align:start position:0%
along the road further
 
00:17:12.949 --> 00:17:12.959 align:start position:0%
so Beth worked with a number of high
 
00:17:15.169 --> 00:17:15.179 align:start position:0%
schools there were 38 high schools at
 
00:17:16.850 --> 00:17:16.860 align:start position:0%
that time which participate in the
 
00:17:18.590 --> 00:17:18.600 align:start position:0%
program I've got the list attached in
 
00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:20.640 align:start position:0%
your your packet there it shows them
 
00:17:22.909 --> 00:17:22.919 align:start position:0%
they're scattered throughout this state
 
00:17:25.370 --> 00:17:25.380 align:start position:0%
and we started seeing some gains some
 
00:17:26.929 --> 00:17:26.939 align:start position:0%
wonderful things occurring as far as
 
00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:28.740 align:start position:0%
understanding and losing that fear of
 
00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:30.650 align:start position:0%
understanding and losing that fear of
mathematics

00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:30.660 align:start position:0%
mathematics
 
00:17:34.669 --> 00:17:34.679 align:start position:0%
problem is then we as a state
 
00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
decided not to fund it any further after
 
00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:38.700 align:start position:0%
the grant dried up two hundred thousand
 
00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
dollars it was lost
 
00:17:42.409 --> 00:17:42.419 align:start position:0%
so if a student went off into this
 
00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:44.460 align:start position:0%
course rather than algebra two they went
 
00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:46.620 align:start position:0%
in you see what right there the next
 
00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
course with Advanced mathematical
 
00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:50.510 align:start position:0%
course with Advanced mathematical
foundations

00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:50.520 align:start position:0%
foundations
 
00:17:52.909 --> 00:17:52.919 align:start position:0%
as that states right there applied
 
00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:55.320 align:start position:0%
reasoning and practical applications of
 
00:17:57.650 --> 00:17:57.660 align:start position:0%
the skills that they have so they went
 
00:17:59.270 --> 00:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
that direction
 
00:18:01.549 --> 00:18:01.559 align:start position:0%
then they would go on to the next level
 
00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:04.740 align:start position:0%
as a senior so that the foundational
 
00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
skilled mathematics was taught in the
 
00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
11th grade to 12th grade the program had
 
00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:12.720 align:start position:0%
a course called quantitative math
 
00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:15.720 align:start position:0%
if you came out of quantitative math and
 
00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:18.360 align:start position:0%
passing that with c and hitting the
 
00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
skill levels that are expected and I'll
 
00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
let Beth handle that then you satisfied
 
00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:27.960 align:start position:0%
that mathematics credit for college in
 
00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:30.600 align:start position:0%
the community college system
 
00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:32.700 align:start position:0%
so and we found that there were a number
 
00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:34.260 align:start position:0%
of students that were able to go this
 
00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:36.240 align:start position:0%
route rather than having to go into the
 
00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:38.240 align:start position:0%
other courses of you know they weren't
 
00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:40.740 align:start position:0%
definitely not ready for trade or
 
00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:44.580 align:start position:0%
calculus when I took my trig I took it I
 
00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:46.860 align:start position:0%
and I passed it but where I really
 
00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
learned it is when I was an fo in
 
00:18:51.529 --> 00:18:51.539 align:start position:0%
Vietnam and I was surveying some of the
 
00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
survey uh the ins the howitzers to get
 
00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:55.980 align:start position:0%
them in on and I was able to triangulate
 
00:18:58.730 --> 00:18:58.740 align:start position:0%
and use my cosine sine tangent all that
 
00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:00.900 align:start position:0%
and it came out so I quickly put it
 
00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
together I wanted to get out of where I
 
00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:05.340 align:start position:0%
was so I quickly learned it there was a
 
00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:06.780 align:start position:0%
reason for it there was no reason for me
 
00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:08.340 align:start position:0%
to learn this stuff while I was in high
 
00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:09.660 align:start position:0%
school I was more interested in
 
00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:11.169 align:start position:0%
school I was more interested in
basketball

00:19:11.169 --> 00:19:11.179 align:start position:0%
basketball
 
00:19:15.049 --> 00:19:15.059 align:start position:0%
so we have this this program and I'm
 
00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
hoping that we can continue and pursue
 
00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:20.340 align:start position:0%
and reinstate this program and give
 
00:19:23.090 --> 00:19:23.100 align:start position:0%
support it's interesting to note this is
 
00:19:25.789 --> 00:19:25.799 align:start position:0%
teachers teaching teachers this program
 
00:19:27.409 --> 00:19:27.419 align:start position:0%
the two hundred thousand dollars takes
 
00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:29.400 align:start position:0%
care of that that amount of money needed
 
00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:31.620 align:start position:0%
for the materials which are provided in
 
00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
the accuplacer but it also provides what
 
00:19:36.529 --> 00:19:36.539 align:start position:0%
I think is most important training
 
00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
during the summer time where teachers
 
00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:40.980 align:start position:0%
will provide a stipend those Math
 
00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:43.320 align:start position:0%
teachers teaching this have a stipend to
 
00:19:44.570 --> 00:19:44.580 align:start position:0%
come down to the community college
 
00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:47.100 align:start position:0%
system and work with a team there a team
 
00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:48.780 align:start position:0%
of folks which are applying this and
 
00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:51.240 align:start position:0%
using it and learning from the people in
 
00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:53.580 align:start position:0%
the field that have been successful in
 
00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
this this is a wonderful opportunity for
 
00:19:58.370 --> 00:19:58.380 align:start position:0%
us to address those remediation needs we
 
00:20:00.789 --> 00:20:00.799 align:start position:0%
have without having to
 
00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
rewrite everything that we have some of
 
00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:05.580 align:start position:0%
the some of the elements needed to do
 
00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:07.980 align:start position:0%
this in place in our schools right now
 
00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:10.620 align:start position:0%
the key to this is let's get folks
 
00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:12.360 align:start position:0%
trained let's give them the opportunity
 
00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
to learn how to teach this and let's get
 
00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:17.340 align:start position:0%
teaching styles matching with learning
 
00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:19.260 align:start position:0%
styles so I'll conclude my testimony on
 
00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
that if there are any questions I'll be
 
00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:22.860 align:start position:0%
glad to take them
 
00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:25.380 align:start position:0%
and thank you any questions from the
 
00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:28.450 align:start position:0%
and thank you any questions from the
committee

00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:28.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:31.490 --> 00:20:31.500 align:start position:0%
yes representative Tanner thank you and
 
00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:33.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I was
 
00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:35.460 align:start position:0%
wondering if um I know this afternoon
 
00:20:37.669 --> 00:20:37.679 align:start position:0%
we're having a bill on uh dyslexia
 
00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:41.580 align:start position:0%
testing and there is a a recent well not
 
00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:44.280 align:start position:0%
recently but a a defined learning
 
00:20:47.870 --> 00:20:47.880 align:start position:0%
disability called uh dyscalcula where
 
00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:51.900 align:start position:0%
students are unable to actually
 
00:20:54.650 --> 00:20:54.660 align:start position:0%
um their brain cannot form calculations
 
00:20:57.890 --> 00:20:57.900 align:start position:0%
and numbers and it leads to math anxiety
 
00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
and so on and I know the dyslexia
 
00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:02.160 align:start position:0%
testing now is going to be down in the
 
00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:04.200 align:start position:0%
Elementary grades I'm just wondering if
 
00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:07.020 align:start position:0%
perhaps as part of this bill
 
00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
um that testing at an early age because
 
00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:11.880 align:start position:0%
we know if they they have reading
 
00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:14.220 align:start position:0%
anxiety or math anxiety they just don't
 
00:21:16.130 --> 00:21:16.140 align:start position:0%
you know it follows them right up
 
00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:17.880 align:start position:0%
through the high school whether that
 
00:21:19.549 --> 00:21:19.559 align:start position:0%
would be a good thing to add thank you
 
00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:22.140 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner I I've looked at
 
00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
the bill you're speaking about where I'm
 
00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:25.260 align:start position:0%
looking forward to hearing it because we
 
00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
have dealt with dyslexia on the
 
00:21:28.549 --> 00:21:28.559 align:start position:0%
committee before one we all recognize
 
00:21:30.770 --> 00:21:30.780 align:start position:0%
and I can remember it was Jack Balcom
 
00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
that really pushed this uh and and
 
00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
served on the special education advisory
 
00:21:37.789 --> 00:21:37.799 align:start position:0%
Council that also recognized it and
 
00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:40.740 align:start position:0%
supported it I said I I want to hear I I
 
00:21:43.549 --> 00:21:43.559 align:start position:0%
haven't heard the uh all ins and outs of
 
00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:45.240 align:start position:0%
that bill but I'm really looking forward
 
00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
to to add that language onto this bill
 
00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
this is something which has a physical
 
00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:52.980 align:start position:0%
note which is directly associated with
 
00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:55.260 align:start position:0%
this particular program this particular
 
00:21:57.830 --> 00:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
program is already in statute if you
 
00:21:59.270 --> 00:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
look at statute you're going to find
 
00:22:00.890 --> 00:22:00.900 align:start position:0%
this program
 
00:22:04.010 --> 00:22:04.020 align:start position:0%
from my perspective I think dyslexia is
 
00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:06.360 align:start position:0%
strong enough to stand on itself and
 
00:22:08.810 --> 00:22:08.820 align:start position:0%
that we can you know address this issue
 
00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:11.340 align:start position:0%
I can remember as a youngster in school
 
00:22:13.370 --> 00:22:13.380 align:start position:0%
I had a very difficult time with that
 
00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:16.200 align:start position:0%
and when I got stressed out and I was
 
00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
always stressed as a youngster in grade
 
00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:20.340 align:start position:0%
one and I can't remember any my teachers
 
00:22:22.130 --> 00:22:22.140 align:start position:0%
names I remember my principal's name Mr
 
00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
McClay up in Toronto and he had a
 
00:22:26.029 --> 00:22:26.039 align:start position:0%
leather strap I remember in the strap
 
00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
but that so I was really a stressed out
 
00:22:30.169 --> 00:22:30.179 align:start position:0%
kid and I oftentimes was reversing my
 
00:22:33.049 --> 00:22:33.059 align:start position:0%
B's and D's and of course I was a U.S
 
00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:35.640 align:start position:0%
citizen learning how to say the word
 
00:22:38.810 --> 00:22:38.820 align:start position:0%
Bean versus bin and and neighbor oh you
 
00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:40.980 align:start position:0%
are and all this and I was really messed
 
00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:44.460 align:start position:0%
up in terms of my spelling so and and I
 
00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:46.380 align:start position:0%
believe that I when I got stressed I
 
00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:47.640 align:start position:0%
started to reflect some of the
 
00:22:51.049 --> 00:22:51.059 align:start position:0%
characteristics of Dyslexia so I look
 
00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
forward to that I I would wait and let
 
00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:55.320 align:start position:0%
before I remarked to that or comment
 
00:22:57.409 --> 00:22:57.419 align:start position:0%
represent Tanner I'd like to hear that
 
00:22:57.419 --> 00:23:00.890 align:start position:0%
represent Tanner I'd like to hear that
bill

00:23:00.890 --> 00:23:00.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
where it says oh I'm so sorry
 
00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:17.820 align:start position:0%
so sorry thank you and thank you for the
 
00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
thorough presentation simple question in
 
00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:21.960 align:start position:0%
the actual text of the bill where it
 
00:23:24.169 --> 00:23:24.179 align:start position:0%
references the total number of
 
00:23:26.270 --> 00:23:26.280 align:start position:0%
uh the number of Summer Institute
 
00:23:28.669 --> 00:23:28.679 align:start position:0%
participants is that referring to the
 
00:23:30.289 --> 00:23:30.299 align:start position:0%
core of teachers that you spoke about
 
00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:32.280 align:start position:0%
having summer training because I didn't
 
00:23:35.149 --> 00:23:35.159 align:start position:0%
understand from the text of the bill did
 
00:23:37.130 --> 00:23:37.140 align:start position:0%
it involved training teachers as well as
 
00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:39.240 align:start position:0%
the opportunities yes it does and I
 
00:23:40.970 --> 00:23:40.980 align:start position:0%
think representative those are the type
 
00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:43.260 align:start position:0%
of questions that Shannon Reed is here
 
00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
in Beth Dorian from the community
 
00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:46.500 align:start position:0%
college system I think they're well
 
00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
prepared to answer that thank you you're
 
00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:50.750 align:start position:0%
prepared to answer that thank you you're
welcome

00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
00:23:53.090 --> 00:23:53.100 align:start position:0%
represent representative the dry
 
00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:54.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:23:56.750 --> 00:23:56.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh what was the
 
00:23:58.070 --> 00:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
original Grant what was the original
 
00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
Grant from that was discontinued another
 
00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
good question for them I know it was 200
 
00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:05.400 align:start position:0%
000 I don't know where Beth I got that
 
00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:08.100 align:start position:0%
dug it up and I but I can remember her
 
00:24:09.649 --> 00:24:09.659 align:start position:0%
telling me when I met with her often
 
00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:10.860 align:start position:0%
over there we're running out of the
 
00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
fifth year we're running out and what
 
00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:14.280 align:start position:0%
are you going to do as and I I remember
 
00:24:16.010 --> 00:24:16.020 align:start position:0%
to representative wolf has also brought
 
00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:17.940 align:start position:0%
a bill in not too long ago trying to get
 
00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
that reinstated of which we didn't make
 
00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:22.620 align:start position:0%
it we made it came out of this committee
 
00:24:25.909 --> 00:24:25.919 align:start position:0%
but a strong vote uh Finance wasn't uh
 
00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:28.140 align:start position:0%
too keen on it this is why we're it's
 
00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:30.360 align:start position:0%
really incumbent upon us if we feel this
 
00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:32.100 align:start position:0%
is something from a policy perspective
 
00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:33.900 align:start position:0%
and we certainly know that there are
 
00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:34.570 align:start position:0%
and we certainly know that there are
certain

00:24:34.570 --> 00:24:34.580 align:start position:0%
certain
 
00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
gains made from this and we've seen it
 
00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:39.240 align:start position:0%
in students before we need to follow it
 
00:24:40.909 --> 00:24:40.919 align:start position:0%
all the way through all our committees
 
00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:43.740 align:start position:0%
here to make sure that it's a successful
 
00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:46.250 align:start position:0%
here to make sure that it's a successful
bill

00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:46.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:48.529 --> 00:24:48.539 align:start position:0%
yes representative Hall thank you Mr
 
00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:50.700 align:start position:0%
Sharon thank you for taking my question
 
00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:53.940 align:start position:0%
um on the 38 schools were they selected
 
00:24:55.610 --> 00:24:55.620 align:start position:0%
or did they were did something wrong
 
00:24:58.730 --> 00:24:58.740 align:start position:0%
it's voluntary and that's again another
 
00:25:00.649 --> 00:25:00.659 align:start position:0%
issue about this was is the director of
 
00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
that program so I would ask her how she
 
00:25:04.789 --> 00:25:04.799 align:start position:0%
got them involved I know there was a lot
 
00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
of communication amongst teachers you
 
00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
know uh in different districts talking
 
00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
with each other and seeing the benefits
 
00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:14.340 align:start position:0%
of this program and teachers do
 
00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
recognize learning style and teaching
 
00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:19.080 align:start position:0%
styles extremely important and this this
 
00:25:22.669 --> 00:25:22.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:22.679 --> 00:25:24.470 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:25:27.649 --> 00:25:27.659 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions uh thank you
 
00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:34.020 align:start position:0%
and uh next would be Beth Dorian from
 
00:25:43.789 --> 00:25:43.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
good morning everyone
 
00:25:47.330 --> 00:25:47.340 align:start position:0%
my name is Beth Doran and I'm the
 
00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:49.140 align:start position:0%
director of college access programs the
 
00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
community college system and I'm going
 
00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:52.740 align:start position:0%
to start I think with just a little
 
00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
brief introduction to just follow up on
 
00:25:57.169 --> 00:25:57.179 align:start position:0%
some of Representative lad's comments
 
00:25:59.210 --> 00:25:59.220 align:start position:0%
and then answer the three questions that
 
00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
were asked and then any further that you
 
00:26:03.409 --> 00:26:03.419 align:start position:0%
may have so I think I just want to state
 
00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:06.240 align:start position:0%
that we are in support and at ccs and H
 
00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:08.460 align:start position:0%
strongly supports this bill and the
 
00:26:11.029 --> 00:26:11.039 align:start position:0%
reasoning for that is because we we as a
 
00:26:12.769 --> 00:26:12.779 align:start position:0%
system have been working with the high
 
00:26:14.450 --> 00:26:14.460 align:start position:0%
schools for some time and trying to deal
 
00:26:17.330 --> 00:26:17.340 align:start position:0%
with the issue of math preparedness when
 
00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
students come to our colleges high
 
00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
school students graduate and come to our
 
00:26:22.909 --> 00:26:22.919 align:start position:0%
colleges and this is a long-standing
 
00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:25.320 align:start position:0%
issue that we've been working on for a
 
00:26:27.529 --> 00:26:27.539 align:start position:0%
number of time and and thought we had a
 
00:26:29.090 --> 00:26:29.100 align:start position:0%
really good solution with the math
 
00:26:31.010 --> 00:26:31.020 align:start position:0%
learning communities we've recently
 
00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:32.820 align:start position:0%
changed recently within the last three
 
00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:36.360 align:start position:0%
or so years how we handle Remediation in
 
00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:38.940 align:start position:0%
within our colleges and prior to the
 
00:26:40.730 --> 00:26:40.740 align:start position:0%
last three years or so students will put
 
00:26:42.769 --> 00:26:42.779 align:start position:0%
in remediation courses which cost them
 
00:26:45.529 --> 00:26:45.539 align:start position:0%
money and did not give them any college
 
00:26:47.029 --> 00:26:47.039 align:start position:0%
credit because they were not college
 
00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:49.440 align:start position:0%
courses they were mediation courses at
 
00:26:51.049 --> 00:26:51.059 align:start position:0%
that time this program fit very very
 
00:26:53.570 --> 00:26:53.580 align:start position:0%
well because we were able to Stave off
 
00:26:55.669 --> 00:26:55.679 align:start position:0%
those remediation courses now what we're
 
00:26:57.289 --> 00:26:57.299 align:start position:0%
doing is running something called
 
00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
co-requisite math courses where students
 
00:27:01.610 --> 00:27:01.620 align:start position:0%
placed in a traditional Math Course and
 
00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:03.720 align:start position:0%
there may be a remediation component but
 
00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:05.100 align:start position:0%
what we're still seeing is high school
 
00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
students graduating and not having the
 
00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
skills that they need in order to be
 
00:27:10.909 --> 00:27:10.919 align:start position:0%
successful in an entry-level math
 
00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:13.320 align:start position:0%
College course so in representative lad
 
00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:15.000 align:start position:0%
contacted us and said you know what do
 
00:27:16.490 --> 00:27:16.500 align:start position:0%
you think is there still a need for this
 
00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
program and frankly from our end we knew
 
00:27:21.049 --> 00:27:21.059 align:start position:0%
there was but I wasn't sure how the high
 
00:27:23.090 --> 00:27:23.100 align:start position:0%
school folks felt so I reached out to
 
00:27:25.789 --> 00:27:25.799 align:start position:0%
several of the high school teachers Math
 
00:27:27.289 --> 00:27:27.299 align:start position:0%
teachers who were involved in the math
 
00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:29.580 align:start position:0%
learning communities project when it was
 
00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:31.980 align:start position:0%
before it ended several years ago and
 
00:27:33.529 --> 00:27:33.539 align:start position:0%
they all said the same thing absolutely
 
00:27:35.690 --> 00:27:35.700 align:start position:0%
this is absolutely still a strong need
 
00:27:38.570 --> 00:27:38.580 align:start position:0%
in our high schools so going to
 
00:27:39.769 --> 00:27:39.779 align:start position:0%
representative a lot and letting him
 
00:27:41.390 --> 00:27:41.400 align:start position:0%
know that yes the high school teachers
 
00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:44.100 align:start position:0%
felt that it was a strong need and as
 
00:27:46.789 --> 00:27:46.799 align:start position:0%
well as our College faculty so again you
 
00:27:48.649 --> 00:27:48.659 align:start position:0%
know we're very supportive of this bill
 
00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:50.760 align:start position:0%
we think it's a great model it's nothing
 
00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:52.740 align:start position:0%
Earth shattering or new and Innovative
 
00:27:55.669 --> 00:27:55.679 align:start position:0%
it's just something that works and uh
 
00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
just to elaborate a little bit on what
 
00:27:58.850 --> 00:27:58.860 align:start position:0%
representative Ladd had said it is made
 
00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:01.620 align:start position:0%
up of two courses the first being what's
 
00:28:03.409 --> 00:28:03.419 align:start position:0%
called Advanced mathematical foundations
 
00:28:06.169 --> 00:28:06.179 align:start position:0%
and what we had done back several years
 
00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
ago was to uh do the accuplacer for all
 
00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:11.820 align:start position:0%
students who
 
00:28:14.450 --> 00:28:14.460 align:start position:0%
may have taken Algebra 2 and may not
 
00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
have scored scored lower than a c or or
 
00:28:20.450 --> 00:28:20.460 align:start position:0%
lower on algebra two and those students
 
00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
were given the accuplacer and the
 
00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:24.360 align:start position:0%
accuplacer we had determined a cut score
 
00:28:26.570 --> 00:28:26.580 align:start position:0%
of 65 and if students scored below that
 
00:28:29.090 --> 00:28:29.100 align:start position:0%
65 they would be placed into the
 
00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
advanced mathematical foundations course
 
00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
and what that is is honestly it's an
 
00:28:34.909 --> 00:28:34.919 align:start position:0%
Algebra 2 course with some of the
 
00:28:37.970 --> 00:28:37.980 align:start position:0%
concepts and I want to also state that I
 
00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
am not a math expert I am not a math
 
00:28:41.390 --> 00:28:41.400 align:start position:0%
teacher don't have a lot of math
 
00:28:43.850 --> 00:28:43.860 align:start position:0%
experience but I was able to get an
 
00:28:45.409 --> 00:28:45.419 align:start position:0%
advanced degree with a handful of math
 
00:28:50.029 --> 00:28:50.039 align:start position:0%
courses intentionally but I I am uh have
 
00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:51.720 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of experience with managing
 
00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
and developing programs so when we put
 
00:28:56.269 --> 00:28:56.279 align:start position:0%
um you know saw that these students
 
00:28:59.330 --> 00:28:59.340 align:start position:0%
needed some more understanding of math
 
00:29:01.370 --> 00:29:01.380 align:start position:0%
concepts specifically algebra and
 
00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
potentially geometry as well our faculty
 
00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
along with some high school teachers
 
00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
developed this Advanced mathematical
 
00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
foundations course and what it is
 
00:29:11.390 --> 00:29:11.400 align:start position:0%
basically is a remediation course that
 
00:29:13.250 --> 00:29:13.260 align:start position:0%
we would have have taught years ago if
 
00:29:14.690 --> 00:29:14.700 align:start position:0%
students were to come into our colleges
 
00:29:16.730 --> 00:29:16.740 align:start position:0%
and not perform well on the accuplacer
 
00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
so it's a remediation course that's
 
00:29:20.510 --> 00:29:20.520 align:start position:0%
taught in the high school for high
 
00:29:22.610 --> 00:29:22.620 align:start position:0%
school credit and not college credit so
 
00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
they're not receiving any college credit
 
00:29:25.730 --> 00:29:25.740 align:start position:0%
but they're also not paying for any type
 
00:29:27.289 --> 00:29:27.299 align:start position:0%
of mediation once they come to our
 
00:29:27.299 --> 00:29:28.430 align:start position:0%
of mediation once they come to our
colleges

00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:28.440 align:start position:0%
colleges
 
00:29:31.370 --> 00:29:31.380 align:start position:0%
once they complete that that advanced
 
00:29:33.049 --> 00:29:33.059 align:start position:0%
mathematical foundations course remember
 
00:29:34.909 --> 00:29:34.919 align:start position:0%
these are students that scored below a
 
00:29:38.269 --> 00:29:38.279 align:start position:0%
65 on the accuplacer they would take the
 
00:29:39.649 --> 00:29:39.659 align:start position:0%
accuplacer again at the end of the
 
00:29:42.049 --> 00:29:42.059 align:start position:0%
course and 95 percent of our students
 
00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:44.760 align:start position:0%
had significantly higher score once
 
00:29:46.850 --> 00:29:46.860 align:start position:0%
completing this course events
 
00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:49.200 align:start position:0%
mathematical foundations is is really
 
00:29:52.250 --> 00:29:52.260 align:start position:0%
based on habits of mind framework in
 
00:29:53.990 --> 00:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
teaching mathematics which is a very
 
00:29:55.549 --> 00:29:55.559 align:start position:0%
different way than mathematics is
 
00:29:58.250 --> 00:29:58.260 align:start position:0%
typically taught if the students did
 
00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:00.240 align:start position:0%
score above a 65 at that point which
 
00:30:01.730 --> 00:30:01.740 align:start position:0%
again the majority of them did they
 
00:30:03.769 --> 00:30:03.779 align:start position:0%
could then take quantitative reasoning
 
00:30:05.269 --> 00:30:05.279 align:start position:0%
and this typically happened in the
 
00:30:06.889 --> 00:30:06.899 align:start position:0%
either their junior or their senior year
 
00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
depending upon how courses are run at
 
00:30:10.669 --> 00:30:10.679 align:start position:0%
the high school whether they're a full
 
00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
year or a semester-based course
 
00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:15.000 align:start position:0%
so the quantitative reasoning is a
 
00:30:16.430 --> 00:30:16.440 align:start position:0%
college credit course it's run through
 
00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:18.240 align:start position:0%
our running staff program and students
 
00:30:19.610 --> 00:30:19.620 align:start position:0%
high school students can take it on our
 
00:30:21.889 --> 00:30:21.899 align:start position:0%
college campuses as well and that is a
 
00:30:24.409 --> 00:30:24.419 align:start position:0%
course that is eligible in probably
 
00:30:26.870 --> 00:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
about 90 percent of our degree programs
 
00:30:29.269 --> 00:30:29.279 align:start position:0%
a requirement I should say so students
 
00:30:30.590 --> 00:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
are able to take that course while
 
00:30:31.789 --> 00:30:31.799 align:start position:0%
they're in high school for college
 
00:30:33.889 --> 00:30:33.899 align:start position:0%
credit and then assist them with the
 
00:30:35.870 --> 00:30:35.880 align:start position:0%
remaining information when they when
 
00:30:38.029 --> 00:30:38.039 align:start position:0%
they come to our colleges for a degree
 
00:30:40.130 --> 00:30:40.140 align:start position:0%
so that's sort of the you know an
 
00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:42.240 align:start position:0%
overall understanding of the program and
 
00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:44.760 align:start position:0%
and and why we think it's important and
 
00:30:47.090 --> 00:30:47.100 align:start position:0%
referencing where the funding came from
 
00:30:49.730 --> 00:30:49.740 align:start position:0%
initially we originally it was back in
 
00:30:52.490 --> 00:30:52.500 align:start position:0%
2010 or 2012 I sorry apologize I've
 
00:30:54.230 --> 00:30:54.240 align:start position:0%
neglected to look at my records before I
 
00:30:57.169 --> 00:30:57.179 align:start position:0%
came but at that time it was funded by
 
00:30:59.630 --> 00:30:59.640 align:start position:0%
the math science partnership and that
 
00:31:02.330 --> 00:31:02.340 align:start position:0%
funding was not really very well I think
 
00:31:04.789 --> 00:31:04.799 align:start position:0%
when it was originally started it was a
 
00:31:06.409 --> 00:31:06.419 align:start position:0%
new and Innovative program and it made
 
00:31:08.029 --> 00:31:08.039 align:start position:0%
sense and the math science partnership
 
00:31:10.250 --> 00:31:10.260 align:start position:0%
funding back then was really based on
 
00:31:12.409 --> 00:31:12.419 align:start position:0%
new and Innovative programming so at
 
00:31:14.330 --> 00:31:14.340 align:start position:0%
that time it was new and Innovative as
 
00:31:16.610 --> 00:31:16.620 align:start position:0%
it as it you know marched on throughout
 
00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:19.260 align:start position:0%
its years it became a program that we
 
00:31:20.810 --> 00:31:20.820 align:start position:0%
didn't make any changes to because it
 
00:31:22.549 --> 00:31:22.559 align:start position:0%
worked very well and the math science
 
00:31:24.769 --> 00:31:24.779 align:start position:0%
partnership funding really did not apply
 
00:31:26.630 --> 00:31:26.640 align:start position:0%
any longer so we applied for something
 
00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:28.260 align:start position:0%
called the college access challenge
 
00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
Grant which was many many years ago and
 
00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
that was a five-year grant that we did
 
00:31:36.049 --> 00:31:36.059 align:start position:0%
receive but unfortunately we lost the
 
00:31:37.669 --> 00:31:37.679 align:start position:0%
state actually lost their maintenance of
 
00:31:40.370 --> 00:31:40.380 align:start position:0%
effort after three years and we lost the
 
00:31:42.409 --> 00:31:42.419 align:start position:0%
funding after three years we went back
 
00:31:44.149 --> 00:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
to the math science partnership got some
 
00:31:46.010 --> 00:31:46.020 align:start position:0%
additional funding for them but again it
 
00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
was not the best fit so that was the
 
00:31:50.330 --> 00:31:50.340 align:start position:0%
history of some of the funding in the
 
00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:51.110 align:start position:0%
history of some of the funding in the
past

00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
past
 
00:31:53.810 --> 00:31:53.820 align:start position:0%
somebody asked what the training to be
 
00:31:55.549 --> 00:31:55.559 align:start position:0%
trained teachers and yes that was very
 
00:31:57.769 --> 00:31:57.779 align:start position:0%
much a part of the program when when a
 
00:32:00.529 --> 00:32:00.539 align:start position:0%
school signed on for to become part of
 
00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:02.840 align:start position:0%
the math science part I'm sorry the the
 
00:32:05.630 --> 00:32:05.640 align:start position:0%
math learning communities then those
 
00:32:08.090 --> 00:32:08.100 align:start position:0%
teachers were expected to attend a
 
00:32:09.889 --> 00:32:09.899 align:start position:0%
summer Institute we called it which was
 
00:32:12.590 --> 00:32:12.600 align:start position:0%
once a year held in June as soon as the
 
00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
school was out our high school teachers
 
00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
and our College faculty would come
 
00:32:19.490 --> 00:32:19.500 align:start position:0%
together and just share curriculum needs
 
00:32:20.750 --> 00:32:20.760 align:start position:0%
and things of that so it can work
 
00:32:22.610 --> 00:32:22.620 align:start position:0%
together in understanding how to best
 
00:32:25.370 --> 00:32:25.380 align:start position:0%
teach this curriculum and the other
 
00:32:27.529 --> 00:32:27.539 align:start position:0%
question I heard was uh was it voluntary
 
00:32:29.330 --> 00:32:29.340 align:start position:0%
for schools and yes we did quite a bit
 
00:32:30.889 --> 00:32:30.899 align:start position:0%
of marketing out to high schools just
 
00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
presenting the program letting them know
 
00:32:35.269 --> 00:32:35.279 align:start position:0%
what the program was all about and it
 
00:32:37.010 --> 00:32:37.020 align:start position:0%
was completely voluntary for them to
 
00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
sign on so we did have we started with
 
00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:41.580 align:start position:0%
probably three or four schools and when
 
00:32:43.130 --> 00:32:43.140 align:start position:0%
the program ended there were about 38
 
00:32:45.409 --> 00:32:45.419 align:start position:0%
high schools that were participating
 
00:32:46.669 --> 00:32:46.679 align:start position:0%
so I'd be happy to take any other
 
00:32:46.679 --> 00:32:48.110 align:start position:0%
so I'd be happy to take any other
questions

00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:48.120 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:32:50.149 --> 00:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for your testimony uh
 
00:32:52.010 --> 00:32:52.020 align:start position:0%
representative miler
 
00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:32:57.289 --> 00:32:57.299 align:start position:0%
being here uh so my my question is is
 
00:32:59.289 --> 00:32:59.299 align:start position:0%
that if
 
00:33:01.789 --> 00:33:01.799 align:start position:0%
the teachers are going through a
 
00:33:03.529 --> 00:33:03.539 align:start position:0%
training program and a conversation
 
00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
about how to teach math in a different
 
00:33:07.370 --> 00:33:07.380 align:start position:0%
kind of a way
 
00:33:11.029 --> 00:33:11.039 align:start position:0%
when they leave that summer program is
 
00:33:14.149 --> 00:33:14.159 align:start position:0%
there then a common curriculum yes that
 
00:33:16.250 --> 00:33:16.260 align:start position:0%
they then use back in their own own
 
00:33:18.889 --> 00:33:18.899 align:start position:0%
school yes they are actually given the
 
00:33:19.909 --> 00:33:19.919 align:start position:0%
curriculum that they should follow
 
00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:21.480 align:start position:0%
there's very specific competency
 
00:33:23.690 --> 00:33:23.700 align:start position:0%
helpline as far as what should be taught
 
00:33:29.149 --> 00:33:29.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:31.009 --> 00:33:31.019 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair and thanks
 
00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:33.240 align:start position:0%
Beth for uh for joining us uh yesterday
 
00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:36.480 align:start position:0%
and today so um I'm sure if you could
 
00:33:38.450 --> 00:33:38.460 align:start position:0%
sort of take me through
 
00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
um just an example just so I understand
 
00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:43.440 align:start position:0%
the flow that so I'm absolutely I so I
 
00:33:45.289 --> 00:33:45.299 align:start position:0%
certainly support this I supported this
 
00:33:47.509 --> 00:33:47.519 align:start position:0%
a few years ago when uh when it came
 
00:33:50.029 --> 00:33:50.039 align:start position:0%
through as well but but if we did a
 
00:33:52.909 --> 00:33:52.919 align:start position:0%
hypothetical example where you know Luke
 
00:33:54.649 --> 00:33:54.659 align:start position:0%
Luna would take seventh grade math
 
00:33:56.509 --> 00:33:56.519 align:start position:0%
eighth grade math and then in ninth
 
00:33:58.789 --> 00:33:58.799 align:start position:0%
grade takes algebra and sort of doesn't
 
00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:01.080 align:start position:0%
really like it in 10th grade algebra 2
 
00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:04.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't really like it when's he when
 
00:34:05.870 --> 00:34:05.880 align:start position:0%
does he
 
00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
um uh when is he tested with the
 
00:34:11.089 --> 00:34:11.099 align:start position:0%
accuplacer and then what's his plan for
 
00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
like 11th grade okay great question and
 
00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:15.589 align:start position:0%
like 11th grade okay great question and
um

00:34:15.589 --> 00:34:15.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:17.869 --> 00:34:17.879 align:start position:0%
this so I'm speaking now back from when
 
00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:19.320 align:start position:0%
we a lot when we last had the program
 
00:34:21.050 --> 00:34:21.060 align:start position:0%
from several years ago at least four or
 
00:34:23.810 --> 00:34:23.820 align:start position:0%
so years ago and what we saw back then
 
00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
was a student a traditional student
 
00:34:27.050 --> 00:34:27.060 align:start position:0%
would come into high school and take
 
00:34:30.050 --> 00:34:30.060 align:start position:0%
algebra one and then uh for for their
 
00:34:33.409 --> 00:34:33.419 align:start position:0%
first year and then this is based on a a
 
00:34:35.149 --> 00:34:35.159 align:start position:0%
high school that has a year-long course
 
00:34:37.129 --> 00:34:37.139 align:start position:0%
as you know now we have there are a lot
 
00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:38.820 align:start position:0%
of schools that go by semester but based
 
00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:40.200 align:start position:0%
on a year-long course and then I can
 
00:34:41.829 --> 00:34:41.839 align:start position:0%
talk about semester based as well
 
00:34:44.270 --> 00:34:44.280 align:start position:0%
freshman year students would take
 
00:34:45.889 --> 00:34:45.899 align:start position:0%
algebra one sophomore year it would be
 
00:34:48.409 --> 00:34:48.419 align:start position:0%
algebra it would be geometry and then
 
00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:50.520 align:start position:0%
junior year it would be algebra two so
 
00:34:52.369 --> 00:34:52.379 align:start position:0%
we would catch those students at the end
 
00:34:54.169 --> 00:34:54.179 align:start position:0%
of their junior year test them with the
 
00:34:56.210 --> 00:34:56.220 align:start position:0%
accuplacer and then they would take
 
00:34:58.070 --> 00:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
senior Math typical Advanced
 
00:34:59.510 --> 00:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
mathematical foundations it was called
 
00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:01.740 align:start position:0%
senior Math at one point so they really
 
00:35:03.109 --> 00:35:03.119 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have a whole lot of time for
 
00:35:04.730 --> 00:35:04.740 align:start position:0%
quantitative reasoning but in the
 
00:35:07.010 --> 00:35:07.020 align:start position:0%
semester-based model students would come
 
00:35:09.410 --> 00:35:09.420 align:start position:0%
in and take algebra one their their
 
00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
freshman year and probably geometry in
 
00:35:14.810 --> 00:35:14.820 align:start position:0%
their let's say first semester of
 
00:35:16.430 --> 00:35:16.440 align:start position:0%
sophomore year in algebra two in the
 
00:35:18.349 --> 00:35:18.359 align:start position:0%
second soft second semester of sophomore
 
00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
year and the junior year we would test
 
00:35:21.530 --> 00:35:21.540 align:start position:0%
them and then they would have the
 
00:35:23.450 --> 00:35:23.460 align:start position:0%
opportunity to take the advanced
 
00:35:25.370 --> 00:35:25.380 align:start position:0%
mathematical foundations in the second
 
00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:27.720 align:start position:0%
semester of their junior year and then
 
00:35:28.730 --> 00:35:28.740 align:start position:0%
they could take the quantitative
 
00:35:30.770 --> 00:35:30.780 align:start position:0%
reasoning in their freshman year I'm
 
00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
sorry in their senior year first
 
00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:32.870 align:start position:0%
sorry in their senior year first
semester

00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
semester
 
00:35:36.109 --> 00:35:36.119 align:start position:0%
and a follow-up on thank you
 
00:35:38.750 --> 00:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
um and what I think I heard you say too
 
00:35:41.450 --> 00:35:41.460 align:start position:0%
is that the the foundation's uh class
 
00:35:44.569 --> 00:35:44.579 align:start position:0%
can um can be given as a running start
 
00:35:46.490 --> 00:35:46.500 align:start position:0%
um the quantitative reasoning can
 
00:35:48.589 --> 00:35:48.599 align:start position:0%
quantitative reason yeah the advanced
 
00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
mathematical foundations is not a
 
00:35:52.069 --> 00:35:52.079 align:start position:0%
college course it's not it's not a
 
00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
running service all right great so they
 
00:35:56.690 --> 00:35:56.700 align:start position:0%
they can exit high school with with
 
00:35:58.910 --> 00:35:58.920 align:start position:0%
quantitative responsive reason and have
 
00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
that apply great thank you
 
00:36:02.690 --> 00:36:02.700 align:start position:0%
representative blackis
 
00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:03.890 align:start position:0%
representative blackis
good

00:36:03.890 --> 00:36:03.900 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:36:06.650 --> 00:36:06.660 align:start position:0%
I think this is an awesome program but I
 
00:36:10.730 --> 00:36:10.740 align:start position:0%
do have a question if in the past you've
 
00:36:12.410 --> 00:36:12.420 align:start position:0%
come up with a program and you've done
 
00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
all this work and you're trained
 
00:36:16.430 --> 00:36:16.440 align:start position:0%
teachers I just want to understand what
 
00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:18.720 align:start position:0%
the money that we are voting for the
 
00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
upcoming years is how that is used in
 
00:36:27.050 --> 00:36:27.060 align:start position:0%
making this program happen sure so the a
 
00:36:28.730 --> 00:36:28.740 align:start position:0%
good part of the funding would be to pay
 
00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:31.140 align:start position:0%
the salary for somebody to to to run the
 
00:36:33.290 --> 00:36:33.300 align:start position:0%
program to be able to monitor it and and
 
00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
run it the summer Institute is a a big
 
00:36:39.050 --> 00:36:39.060 align:start position:0%
expense of the program and that's where
 
00:36:40.250 --> 00:36:40.260 align:start position:0%
we're bringing all of the teachers
 
00:36:42.589 --> 00:36:42.599 align:start position:0%
together we would also uh the funding
 
00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
would also go to any curriculum needs
 
00:36:46.190 --> 00:36:46.200 align:start position:0%
books and things of that so that the
 
00:36:48.170 --> 00:36:48.180 align:start position:0%
high schools may need so if the high
 
00:36:50.690 --> 00:36:50.700 align:start position:0%
schools don't have the appropriate books
 
00:36:52.490 --> 00:36:52.500 align:start position:0%
that um then then the funding would be
 
00:36:54.650 --> 00:36:54.660 align:start position:0%
able to pay for that as well
 
00:36:57.829 --> 00:36:57.839 align:start position:0%
um it it also pays for stipends for High
 
00:36:59.569 --> 00:36:59.579 align:start position:0%
School faculty as well as College
 
00:37:02.030 --> 00:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
faculty to form an advisory committee so
 
00:37:04.370 --> 00:37:04.380 align:start position:0%
that advisory committee meets monthly to
 
00:37:05.930 --> 00:37:05.940 align:start position:0%
determine you know what the needs are
 
00:37:07.790 --> 00:37:07.800 align:start position:0%
and what changes may need to be made and
 
00:37:09.410 --> 00:37:09.420 align:start position:0%
they're in constant communication with
 
00:37:10.849 --> 00:37:10.859 align:start position:0%
all of the high school teachers that are
 
00:37:13.130 --> 00:37:13.140 align:start position:0%
running the program so it's it's quite a
 
00:37:14.750 --> 00:37:14.760 align:start position:0%
bit of salary based you know mostly
 
00:37:16.730 --> 00:37:16.740 align:start position:0%
because the program needs to be managed
 
00:37:18.770 --> 00:37:18.780 align:start position:0%
but again also
 
00:37:20.750 --> 00:37:20.760 align:start position:0%
um a lot of training as well
 
00:37:21.890 --> 00:37:21.900 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:37:24.170 --> 00:37:24.180 align:start position:0%
represent Pelzer
 
00:37:27.170 --> 00:37:27.180 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr vicer um
 
00:37:29.450 --> 00:37:29.460 align:start position:0%
I'd just like to ask you who develops
 
00:37:32.210 --> 00:37:32.220 align:start position:0%
the um the curricula for these programs
 
00:37:35.089 --> 00:37:35.099 align:start position:0%
our math experts not me
 
00:37:36.890 --> 00:37:36.900 align:start position:0%
um that would be our High School faculty
 
00:37:39.650 --> 00:37:39.660 align:start position:0%
along with our College faculty in unison
 
00:37:40.910 --> 00:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:37:43.069 --> 00:37:43.079 align:start position:0%
representative kisscadden
 
00:37:45.170 --> 00:37:45.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:37:47.329 --> 00:37:47.339 align:start position:0%
um just backing up on that Cur the
 
00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
curriculum what grade levels is it
 
00:37:51.770 --> 00:37:51.780 align:start position:0%
really intended for just middle to high
 
00:37:54.410 --> 00:37:54.420 align:start position:0%
or does it start in early grades
 
00:37:56.510 --> 00:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
um well it definitely built for high
 
00:37:58.970 --> 00:37:58.980 align:start position:0%
school students okay uh for sure because
 
00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:01.200 align:start position:0%
it's it's again we we're looking at
 
00:38:02.930 --> 00:38:02.940 align:start position:0%
students who have not done well in
 
00:38:04.910 --> 00:38:04.920 align:start position:0%
algebra 2. those those are the students
 
00:38:06.650 --> 00:38:06.660 align:start position:0%
that we're focusing on students that may
 
00:38:08.930 --> 00:38:08.940 align:start position:0%
have got a C or below if they're if
 
00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
they're getting a c in Algebra 2 they
 
00:38:12.170 --> 00:38:12.180 align:start position:0%
really don't understand the concepts and
 
00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
the teachers are developing the
 
00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
following the curriculum I'm sorry
 
00:38:20.210 --> 00:38:20.220 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes well the the curriculum
 
00:38:22.130 --> 00:38:22.140 align:start position:0%
has been developed so we've been using
 
00:38:24.650 --> 00:38:24.660 align:start position:0%
when the program was in operation we
 
00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:26.640 align:start position:0%
were using the same curriculum for it
 
00:38:27.950 --> 00:38:27.960 align:start position:0%
did go through some modifications
 
00:38:29.690 --> 00:38:29.700 align:start position:0%
specifically the college the
 
00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
college-based course but we would need
 
00:38:34.190 --> 00:38:34.200 align:start position:0%
to review all of that again which is why
 
00:38:36.410 --> 00:38:36.420 align:start position:0%
you know if this bill were to receive to
 
00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:38.640 align:start position:0%
pass and receive funding then we would
 
00:38:40.190 --> 00:38:40.200 align:start position:0%
need to bring our math experts together
 
00:38:41.810 --> 00:38:41.820 align:start position:0%
to review all of that curriculum again
 
00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
but I don't see it changing to any great
 
00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:44.810 align:start position:0%
but I don't see it changing to any great
degree

00:38:44.810 --> 00:38:44.820 align:start position:0%
degree
 
00:38:44.820 --> 00:38:46.310 align:start position:0%
degree
follow-up

00:38:46.310 --> 00:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:38:49.250 --> 00:38:49.260 align:start position:0%
uh thank you my question is on the
 
00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:50.329 align:start position:0%
uh thank you my question is on the
funding

00:38:50.329 --> 00:38:50.339 align:start position:0%
funding
 
00:38:52.490 --> 00:38:52.500 align:start position:0%
it it would seem like if there were
 
00:38:54.770 --> 00:38:54.780 align:start position:0%
great results that districts or
 
00:38:56.150 --> 00:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
Community College would put that in
 
00:38:57.770 --> 00:38:57.780 align:start position:0%
their local budget so it's sustainable
 
00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:00.240 align:start position:0%
because we know grants kind of right you
 
00:39:03.109 --> 00:39:03.119 align:start position:0%
know run out and is having a bill in the
 
00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
table more of an assurance for funding
 
00:39:09.050 --> 00:39:09.060 align:start position:0%
I mean it's a shame that results were
 
00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:10.130 align:start position:0%
I mean it's a shame that results were
seen

00:39:10.130 --> 00:39:10.140 align:start position:0%
seen
 
00:39:12.290 --> 00:39:12.300 align:start position:0%
and now we've got to reinvent the wheel
 
00:39:14.690 --> 00:39:14.700 align:start position:0%
I feel bad about that yeah we really
 
00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:17.160 align:start position:0%
need to rely on the high schools to to
 
00:39:20.089 --> 00:39:20.099 align:start position:0%
be able to provide the the teachers and
 
00:39:21.710 --> 00:39:21.720 align:start position:0%
that's I think you know a partnership
 
00:39:23.750 --> 00:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
that's that's critical you know if we
 
00:39:25.550 --> 00:39:25.560 align:start position:0%
have the funding we can train those
 
00:39:27.950 --> 00:39:27.960 align:start position:0%
teachers and we can bring the teachers
 
00:39:29.990 --> 00:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
together to ensure that what's being
 
00:39:31.910 --> 00:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
what should be taught is being taught to
 
00:39:33.829 --> 00:39:33.839 align:start position:0%
assist these students that that have
 
00:39:36.650 --> 00:39:36.660 align:start position:0%
remediation needs but oftentimes you
 
00:39:38.210 --> 00:39:38.220 align:start position:0%
know there are difficulties sometimes
 
00:39:39.710 --> 00:39:39.720 align:start position:0%
with the high schools being able to
 
00:39:41.150 --> 00:39:41.160 align:start position:0%
provide the teachers that are that are
 
00:39:44.089 --> 00:39:44.099 align:start position:0%
needed so I can't speak to the high
 
00:39:45.829 --> 00:39:45.839 align:start position:0%
schools and and the school districts as
 
00:39:48.770 --> 00:39:48.780 align:start position:0%
far as financial needs but with this
 
00:39:50.930 --> 00:39:50.940 align:start position:0%
funding we are able to bring all of that
 
00:39:52.910 --> 00:39:52.920 align:start position:0%
together and really function well which
 
00:39:55.010 --> 00:39:55.020 align:start position:0%
is why it's sort of kind of fell by the
 
00:39:56.690 --> 00:39:56.700 align:start position:0%
wayside when when the program ended
 
00:39:58.069 --> 00:39:58.079 align:start position:0%
because there was nobody there to
 
00:40:00.530 --> 00:40:00.540 align:start position:0%
continue the just you know what what
 
00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
what needed to happen to ensure that the
 
00:40:04.010 --> 00:40:04.020 align:start position:0%
students were receiving both of those
 
00:40:05.930 --> 00:40:05.940 align:start position:0%
course levels
 
00:40:08.510 --> 00:40:08.520 align:start position:0%
representative pedernal thank you Mr
 
00:40:10.010 --> 00:40:10.020 align:start position:0%
Sharon thank you for taking my question
 
00:40:12.829 --> 00:40:12.839 align:start position:0%
as I look at these um achievement scores
 
00:40:15.650 --> 00:40:15.660 align:start position:0%
I noticed the trend that in the younger
 
00:40:17.690 --> 00:40:17.700 align:start position:0%
years the students do well and then as
 
00:40:20.329 --> 00:40:20.339 align:start position:0%
the math gets in right exponentially
 
00:40:22.370 --> 00:40:22.380 align:start position:0%
more challenging the scores start to
 
00:40:24.530 --> 00:40:24.540 align:start position:0%
drop off and I certainly experience that
 
00:40:28.370 --> 00:40:28.380 align:start position:0%
myself you know as a as a student a long
 
00:40:31.130 --> 00:40:31.140 align:start position:0%
time ago so I feel like uh I should say
 
00:40:32.770 --> 00:40:32.780 align:start position:0%
it appears to me that we're still
 
00:40:35.930 --> 00:40:35.940 align:start position:0%
applying math education the same way as
 
00:40:37.310 --> 00:40:37.320 align:start position:0%
it was applied
 
00:40:40.250 --> 00:40:40.260 align:start position:0%
almost 40 years ago when I was in high
 
00:40:42.770 --> 00:40:42.780 align:start position:0%
school so I'm wondering if maybe there's
 
00:40:46.190 --> 00:40:46.200 align:start position:0%
something else missing in the students
 
00:40:49.069 --> 00:40:49.079 align:start position:0%
in the education process that would help
 
00:40:52.069 --> 00:40:52.079 align:start position:0%
the students learn to would help in the
 
00:40:54.530 --> 00:40:54.540 align:start position:0%
ability to logically apply math skills
 
00:40:56.510 --> 00:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
more to the abstract
 
00:40:59.210 --> 00:40:59.220 align:start position:0%
basic math skills to the more abstract
 
00:41:01.010 --> 00:41:01.020 align:start position:0%
Concepts so maybe there's something else
 
00:41:04.730 --> 00:41:04.740 align:start position:0%
that we are missing that isn't
 
00:41:06.530 --> 00:41:06.540 align:start position:0%
the hammer that we've been hitting over
 
00:41:09.970 --> 00:41:09.980 align:start position:0%
students heads with me
 
00:41:12.650 --> 00:41:12.660 align:start position:0%
very possible but as a community college
 
00:41:15.050 --> 00:41:15.060 align:start position:0%
system what we're looking at as far as
 
00:41:17.870 --> 00:41:17.880 align:start position:0%
what we see is students coming in as as
 
00:41:20.089 --> 00:41:20.099 align:start position:0%
as high school graduates and not having
 
00:41:22.790 --> 00:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
that level of math skill to actually
 
00:41:24.650 --> 00:41:24.660 align:start position:0%
perform well in a college course so
 
00:41:27.710 --> 00:41:27.720 align:start position:0%
that's our Focus follow up follow up
 
00:41:29.270 --> 00:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
um yeah so I'm just saying if there's
 
00:41:31.069 --> 00:41:31.079 align:start position:0%
something maybe or in the earlier years
 
00:41:32.930 --> 00:41:32.940 align:start position:0%
it seems to drop off around 8th grade
 
00:41:34.310 --> 00:41:34.320 align:start position:0%
right definitely because they
 
00:41:36.530 --> 00:41:36.540 align:start position:0%
immediately jump into algebra and that
 
00:41:38.450 --> 00:41:38.460 align:start position:0%
starts to become very abstract we'd be
 
00:41:39.710 --> 00:41:39.720 align:start position:0%
certainly willing to look into that
 
00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:41.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:45.650 align:start position:0%
thank you
Bonnie

00:41:45.650 --> 00:41:45.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:47.329 --> 00:41:47.339 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:41:49.069 --> 00:41:49.079 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:41:51.170 --> 00:41:51.180 align:start position:0%
um my question follows uh representative
 
00:41:53.690 --> 00:41:53.700 align:start position:0%
cascadden's um in terms of the
 
00:41:55.849 --> 00:41:55.859 align:start position:0%
curriculum itself
 
00:41:58.430 --> 00:41:58.440 align:start position:0%
um is there a cost associated with that
 
00:42:00.410 --> 00:42:00.420 align:start position:0%
curriculum that eventually the districts
 
00:42:03.829 --> 00:42:03.839 align:start position:0%
have to assume or is it just a change in
 
00:42:06.890 --> 00:42:06.900 align:start position:0%
the delivery that you're teaching the
 
00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
teachers to address the students needs
 
00:42:13.370 --> 00:42:13.380 align:start position:0%
it's really a change in delivery like I
 
00:42:15.410 --> 00:42:15.420 align:start position:0%
said we we work with the habits of mind
 
00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
in teaching mathematics and I don't know
 
00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
the specifics of that but
 
00:42:21.950 --> 00:42:21.960 align:start position:0%
um that's really the focus so there's no
 
00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:24.720 align:start position:0%
there's no cost at all no we provide all
 
00:42:27.829 --> 00:42:27.839 align:start position:0%
of the curriculum to any any uh High
 
00:42:29.810 --> 00:42:29.820 align:start position:0%
School signing on WE hand them the
 
00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
curriculum and then provide continual
 
00:42:33.410 --> 00:42:33.420 align:start position:0%
professional development for their
 
00:42:35.630 --> 00:42:35.640 align:start position:0%
teachers thank you so no class of the
 
00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:38.640 align:start position:0%
district just a quick follow-up yes I
 
00:42:41.329 --> 00:42:41.339 align:start position:0%
assume that these two courses would also
 
00:42:43.490 --> 00:42:43.500 align:start position:0%
go towards graduation requirements in
 
00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
lieu of the other courses yes thank you
 
00:42:49.010 --> 00:42:49.020 align:start position:0%
representative Hall
 
00:42:50.690 --> 00:42:50.700 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:42:53.390 --> 00:42:53.400 align:start position:0%
my question I'm wondering about it seems
 
00:42:56.270 --> 00:42:56.280 align:start position:0%
like a problem here is teacher training
 
00:42:58.370 --> 00:42:58.380 align:start position:0%
right mathematics teacher training so is
 
00:43:00.650 --> 00:43:00.660 align:start position:0%
there any communication with the other
 
00:43:02.569 --> 00:43:02.579 align:start position:0%
colleges the you know the our
 
00:43:05.150 --> 00:43:05.160 align:start position:0%
universities that teach teachers I mean
 
00:43:07.370 --> 00:43:07.380 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm wondering
 
00:43:09.290 --> 00:43:09.300 align:start position:0%
why is this different why aren't they
 
00:43:11.210 --> 00:43:11.220 align:start position:0%
being taught already when they're coming
 
00:43:13.010 --> 00:43:13.020 align:start position:0%
out right their communication with the
 
00:43:14.510 --> 00:43:14.520 align:start position:0%
higher ed
 
00:43:16.130 --> 00:43:16.140 align:start position:0%
um we we do work with the university
 
00:43:19.250 --> 00:43:19.260 align:start position:0%
system in in uh accepting the courses
 
00:43:21.230 --> 00:43:21.240 align:start position:0%
such as quantitative reasoning to ensure
 
00:43:24.530 --> 00:43:24.540 align:start position:0%
that the curriculum we have for our for
 
00:43:25.970 --> 00:43:25.980 align:start position:0%
our college credit course which is the
 
00:43:27.530 --> 00:43:27.540 align:start position:0%
quantitative reasoning will be accepted
 
00:43:29.630 --> 00:43:29.640 align:start position:0%
at our university colleges but as far as
 
00:43:31.849 --> 00:43:31.859 align:start position:0%
training teachers that's not something
 
00:43:34.490 --> 00:43:34.500 align:start position:0%
we've we've specifically spoke with
 
00:43:36.170 --> 00:43:36.180 align:start position:0%
Fourier universities on but I can tell
 
00:43:37.190 --> 00:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
you that my daughter is an elementary
 
00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
school teacher and took one Math course
 
00:43:42.829 --> 00:43:42.839 align:start position:0%
her entire teacher training so I can't
 
00:43:44.270 --> 00:43:44.280 align:start position:0%
speak to that but
 
00:43:46.250 --> 00:43:46.260 align:start position:0%
um you know as I said we don't we don't
 
00:43:48.770 --> 00:43:48.780 align:start position:0%
necessarily work with um the four years
 
00:43:51.770 --> 00:43:51.780 align:start position:0%
on what that curriculum should look like
 
00:43:51.780 --> 00:44:02.170 align:start position:0%
on what that curriculum should look like
foreign

00:44:02.170 --> 00:44:02.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:05.089 --> 00:44:05.099 align:start position:0%
the practicality of this the
 
00:44:12.470 --> 00:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:14.270 align:start position:0%
 
anticipated

00:44:14.270 --> 00:44:14.280 align:start position:0%
anticipated
 
00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:15.950 align:start position:0%
anticipated
um

00:44:15.950 --> 00:44:15.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:19.670 --> 00:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
these this course or series of courses
 
00:44:22.250 --> 00:44:22.260 align:start position:0%
have to be embedded into current High
 
00:44:24.170 --> 00:44:24.180 align:start position:0%
School curriculums approved by local
 
00:44:25.550 --> 00:44:25.560 align:start position:0%
school boards
 
00:44:28.730 --> 00:44:28.740 align:start position:0%
something will have to come out of the
 
00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
math program because teacher's schedules
 
00:44:32.569 --> 00:44:32.579 align:start position:0%
are already
 
00:44:34.370 --> 00:44:34.380 align:start position:0%
um by this time at that point in July
 
00:44:37.550 --> 00:44:37.560 align:start position:0%
are already set for the following year
 
00:44:39.349 --> 00:44:39.359 align:start position:0%
um obviously and so there is there is a
 
00:44:41.750 --> 00:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
cost to the school in terms of maybe one
 
00:44:43.490 --> 00:44:43.500 align:start position:0%
less if you're teaching this course you
 
00:44:45.770 --> 00:44:45.780 align:start position:0%
can't teach the other course
 
00:44:47.150 --> 00:44:47.160 align:start position:0%
um I'm not suggesting that's bad I'm
 
00:44:48.710 --> 00:44:48.720 align:start position:0%
just talking about the practicality of
 
00:44:51.770 --> 00:44:51.780 align:start position:0%
it so I wonder if the the implementation
 
00:44:51.780 --> 00:44:53.270 align:start position:0%
it so I wonder if the the implementation
date

00:44:53.270 --> 00:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
date
 
00:44:54.890 --> 00:44:54.900 align:start position:0%
um what what is actually going to happen
 
00:44:58.069 --> 00:44:58.079 align:start position:0%
in the next calendar year or when do you
 
00:45:00.530 --> 00:45:00.540 align:start position:0%
see uh based on knowing that you have
 
00:45:03.589 --> 00:45:03.599 align:start position:0%
these hurdles uh that actually would be
 
00:45:11.210 --> 00:45:11.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:13.370 --> 00:45:13.380 align:start position:0%
sorry about that the first year would
 
00:45:15.829 --> 00:45:15.839 align:start position:0%
definitely be a planning year so I would
 
00:45:17.270 --> 00:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
see that
 
00:45:19.609 --> 00:45:19.619 align:start position:0%
um if we were to start in even July the
 
00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:20.640 align:start position:0%
first thing we would need to do would be
 
00:45:22.490 --> 00:45:22.500 align:start position:0%
to hire a program coordinator somebody
 
00:45:24.470 --> 00:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
who would coordinate the project and
 
00:45:25.910 --> 00:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
then they would start their Outreach to
 
00:45:27.710 --> 00:45:27.720 align:start position:0%
the high schools to see who could who
 
00:45:29.270 --> 00:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
who is willing or interested in coming
 
00:45:32.390 --> 00:45:32.400 align:start position:0%
on board so and and I would see that
 
00:45:34.370 --> 00:45:34.380 align:start position:0%
occurring through December or so really
 
00:45:36.470 --> 00:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
sort of understanding the landscape and
 
00:45:38.690 --> 00:45:38.700 align:start position:0%
and seeing what schools may be
 
00:45:40.130 --> 00:45:40.140 align:start position:0%
interested in coming on board and then
 
00:45:43.010 --> 00:45:43.020 align:start position:0%
hopefully in that January working with
 
00:45:44.569 --> 00:45:44.579 align:start position:0%
those districts to be able to prepare
 
00:45:48.170 --> 00:45:48.180 align:start position:0%
for the fall so I see it also as more
 
00:45:49.849 --> 00:45:49.859 align:start position:0%
options for high school students so
 
00:45:51.829 --> 00:45:51.839 align:start position:0%
remember we're talking about a student
 
00:45:54.290 --> 00:45:54.300 align:start position:0%
who is not typically a fan of math so
 
00:45:56.030 --> 00:45:56.040 align:start position:0%
these are students who are not done who
 
00:45:58.370 --> 00:45:58.380 align:start position:0%
have not done well in math courses so
 
00:45:59.870 --> 00:45:59.880 align:start position:0%
it's giving them more options you know
 
00:46:01.130 --> 00:46:01.140 align:start position:0%
these are not students who are going to
 
00:46:04.130 --> 00:46:04.140 align:start position:0%
take calculus or or any or and do well
 
00:46:06.349 --> 00:46:06.359 align:start position:0%
in it or any math course like that so
 
00:46:07.910 --> 00:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
it's going to provide them with another
 
00:46:09.589 --> 00:46:09.599 align:start position:0%
option to take a course that's going to
 
00:46:11.870 --> 00:46:11.880 align:start position:0%
build on their math School SK skills and
 
00:46:13.370 --> 00:46:13.380 align:start position:0%
then be able to take that college level
 
00:46:15.710 --> 00:46:15.720 align:start position:0%
course just prior to graduating from
 
00:46:18.170 --> 00:46:18.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:20.510 --> 00:46:20.520 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you
 
00:46:22.990 --> 00:46:23.000 align:start position:0%
um on the same same thinking then
 
00:46:25.010 --> 00:46:25.020 align:start position:0%
if it's going to go into the high school
 
00:46:27.470 --> 00:46:27.480 align:start position:0%
curriculum then my assumption is that
 
00:46:29.450 --> 00:46:29.460 align:start position:0%
any student could take it right in
 
00:46:31.069 --> 00:46:31.079 align:start position:0%
middle school and not necessarily be
 
00:46:33.290 --> 00:46:33.300 align:start position:0%
going on to community colleges
 
00:46:35.750 --> 00:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
correcting that for that piece
 
00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:37.490 align:start position:0%
correcting that for that piece
okay

00:46:37.490 --> 00:46:37.500 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:46:39.290 --> 00:46:39.300 align:start position:0%
um thank you thank you Mr chair thank
 
00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:42.490 align:start position:0%
um thank you thank you Mr chair thank
you

00:46:42.490 --> 00:46:42.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:44.809 --> 00:46:44.819 align:start position:0%
representative Hall thank you Mr chair
 
00:46:47.150 --> 00:46:47.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my last question
 
00:46:49.849 --> 00:46:49.859 align:start position:0%
um so these kids the schools that didn't
 
00:46:52.370 --> 00:46:52.380 align:start position:0%
buy in do you think it was because they
 
00:46:52.380 --> 00:46:53.450 align:start position:0%
buy in do you think it was because they
already

00:46:53.450 --> 00:46:53.460 align:start position:0%
already
 
00:46:56.089 --> 00:46:56.099 align:start position:0%
already had foundations of math classes
 
00:46:58.430 --> 00:46:58.440 align:start position:0%
you know if they weren't interested I
 
00:47:00.109 --> 00:47:00.119 align:start position:0%
would suspect they just probably didn't
 
00:47:02.510 --> 00:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
know enough about it or may not have
 
00:47:04.069 --> 00:47:04.079 align:start position:0%
been ready to make a commitment for
 
00:47:05.510 --> 00:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
whatever reason maybe they didn't feel
 
00:47:07.309 --> 00:47:07.319 align:start position:0%
the districts didn't feel like they had
 
00:47:09.589 --> 00:47:09.599 align:start position:0%
the capacity or the resources to
 
00:47:12.050 --> 00:47:12.060 align:start position:0%
dedicate teachers as as you had
 
00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:13.190 align:start position:0%
dedicate teachers as as you had
mentioned

00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
00:47:16.010 --> 00:47:16.020 align:start position:0%
um to that specific course or program I
 
00:47:19.490 --> 00:47:19.500 align:start position:0%
think that would be my guess thank you
 
00:47:21.410 --> 00:47:21.420 align:start position:0%
Progressive Tanner
 
00:47:23.210 --> 00:47:23.220 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:24.720 align:start position:0%
question do you think
 
00:47:28.130 --> 00:47:28.140 align:start position:0%
um it it's my feeling that
 
00:47:31.490 --> 00:47:31.500 align:start position:0%
um finding qualified Math teachers is a
 
00:47:34.130 --> 00:47:34.140 align:start position:0%
problem in New in all schools Across the
 
00:47:36.650 --> 00:47:36.660 align:start position:0%
Nation and certainly we have a teacher
 
00:47:37.910 --> 00:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
shortage and
 
00:47:40.550 --> 00:47:40.560 align:start position:0%
you know a lot of the Math teachers that
 
00:47:44.030 --> 00:47:44.040 align:start position:0%
I knew that left the the uh profession
 
00:47:47.210 --> 00:47:47.220 align:start position:0%
of teaching you know that their salaries
 
00:47:49.550 --> 00:47:49.560 align:start position:0%
went up exponentially
 
00:47:51.710 --> 00:47:51.720 align:start position:0%
um and they had a lot less struggles I
 
00:47:55.130 --> 00:47:55.140 align:start position:0%
think but do you think uh the fact that
 
00:47:57.950 --> 00:47:57.960 align:start position:0%
we have trouble with finding Math
 
00:48:00.050 --> 00:48:00.060 align:start position:0%
teachers and perhaps the people that we
 
00:48:01.270 --> 00:48:01.280 align:start position:0%
do find
 
00:48:04.309 --> 00:48:04.319 align:start position:0%
may not have had much training at all
 
00:48:06.410 --> 00:48:06.420 align:start position:0%
and and teaching that they just get a
 
00:48:08.569 --> 00:48:08.579 align:start position:0%
emergency certificate or something like
 
00:48:10.609 --> 00:48:10.619 align:start position:0%
that that that's part of the issue that
 
00:48:13.430 --> 00:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
we need to look at at that
 
00:48:15.589 --> 00:48:15.599 align:start position:0%
um this is possible I mean I remember
 
00:48:17.450 --> 00:48:17.460 align:start position:0%
when when my own children were in high
 
00:48:19.730 --> 00:48:19.740 align:start position:0%
school and they were they weren't great
 
00:48:22.130 --> 00:48:22.140 align:start position:0%
at math either and there were a lot of
 
00:48:23.630 --> 00:48:23.640 align:start position:0%
at that time there were a lot of
 
00:48:25.609 --> 00:48:25.619 align:start position:0%
Engineers being laid off and a lot of
 
00:48:27.230 --> 00:48:27.240 align:start position:0%
Engineers were coming in to teach math
 
00:48:29.210 --> 00:48:29.220 align:start position:0%
and didn't have teaching skills
 
00:48:31.190 --> 00:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
basically they knew math but they maybe
 
00:48:33.829 --> 00:48:33.839 align:start position:0%
didn't know how to teach as well to a
 
00:48:35.630 --> 00:48:35.640 align:start position:0%
student who was struggling so I'm sure
 
00:48:37.609 --> 00:48:37.619 align:start position:0%
that may play into it in some ways but I
 
00:48:39.230 --> 00:48:39.240 align:start position:0%
think that's where that's where this
 
00:48:41.390 --> 00:48:41.400 align:start position:0%
program really helps as well because we
 
00:48:42.950 --> 00:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
work with those teachers and helping
 
00:48:45.530 --> 00:48:45.540 align:start position:0%
them to understand how to teach these
 
00:48:48.730 --> 00:48:48.740 align:start position:0%
basic concepts in a different way
 
00:48:52.069 --> 00:48:52.079 align:start position:0%
I can see no further questions thank you
 
00:48:53.450 --> 00:48:53.460 align:start position:0%
very much thank you
 
00:48:55.430 --> 00:48:55.440 align:start position:0%
and I don't believe there are any
 
00:49:00.290 --> 00:49:00.300 align:start position:0%
further cards for uh HP 419 so I will uh
 
00:49:03.170 --> 00:49:03.180 align:start position:0%
close the hearing on 14 actually before
 
00:49:08.270 --> 00:49:08.280 align:start position:0%
uh 19 and we'll move uh straight into HB
 
00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:09.490 align:start position:0%
uh 19 and we'll move uh straight into HB
420

00:49:09.490 --> 00:49:09.500 align:start position:0%
420
 
00:49:13.309 --> 00:49:13.319 align:start position:0%
which is relative to the availability
 
00:49:15.710 --> 00:49:15.720 align:start position:0%
and funding for the Dual and concurrent
 
00:49:17.089 --> 00:49:17.099 align:start position:0%

00:49:30.290 --> 00:49:30.300 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
the introduction will be by the prime
 
00:49:41.150 --> 00:49:41.160 align:start position:0%

00:50:09.829 --> 00:50:09.839 align:start position:0%
again to members of the committee
 
00:50:11.930 --> 00:50:11.940 align:start position:0%
education committee uh for the record
 
00:50:14.750 --> 00:50:14.760 align:start position:0%
again my name is Rick Ladd I represented
 
00:50:17.450 --> 00:50:17.460 align:start position:0%
in Grafton 5 that is Haverhill and other
 
00:50:19.970 --> 00:50:19.980 align:start position:0%
communities around Haverhill I'm here
 
00:50:24.589 --> 00:50:24.599 align:start position:0%
today to as Prime sponsor of HB 420 the
 
00:50:26.390 --> 00:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
availability and funding for dual and
 
00:50:28.150 --> 00:50:28.160 align:start position:0%
concurrent enrollment program
 
00:50:31.430 --> 00:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
this is again a program which deals
 
00:50:33.050 --> 00:50:33.060 align:start position:0%
directly with our community college
 
00:50:33.060 --> 00:50:34.490 align:start position:0%
directly with our community college
system

00:50:34.490 --> 00:50:34.500 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:50:38.030 --> 00:50:38.040 align:start position:0%
and just as uh before I get into where
 
00:50:39.829 --> 00:50:39.839 align:start position:0%
I'm going to say I want you to let you
 
00:50:43.309 --> 00:50:43.319 align:start position:0%
know that behind me we do have the
 
00:50:45.530 --> 00:50:45.540 align:start position:0%
chancellor for the community college
 
00:50:49.190 --> 00:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
system uh Dr Mark Rosenstein and Shannon
 
00:50:50.870 --> 00:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
Reed also from the community college
 
00:50:53.210 --> 00:50:53.220 align:start position:0%
system which I'm sure will uh want to
 
00:50:56.930 --> 00:50:56.940 align:start position:0%
address this uh I had written on the top
 
00:50:58.370 --> 00:50:58.380 align:start position:0%
part of this I'm not gonna because I
 
00:51:00.530 --> 00:51:00.540 align:start position:0%
know time is time and we've got to
 
00:51:04.010 --> 00:51:04.020 align:start position:0%
hustle along here but uh why what is a
 
00:51:06.230 --> 00:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
dual concurrent enrollment program you
 
00:51:07.790 --> 00:51:07.800 align:start position:0%
can read through that and see some of
 
00:51:09.470 --> 00:51:09.480 align:start position:0%
the statements which I referenced to
 
00:51:11.030 --> 00:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
that a lot of that comes out of the
 
00:51:12.589 --> 00:51:12.599 align:start position:0%
community college system
 
00:51:15.290 --> 00:51:15.300 align:start position:0%
uh what changes are identified in this
 
00:51:17.030 --> 00:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
bill is what I want to tackle right now
 
00:51:19.370 --> 00:51:19.380 align:start position:0%
so we can get on to the professionals
 
00:51:22.309 --> 00:51:22.319 align:start position:0%
behind me program offerings will include
 
00:51:23.809 --> 00:51:23.819 align:start position:0%
other courses that are fundamental
 
00:51:25.670 --> 00:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
necessary for success in post-secondary
 
00:51:28.069 --> 00:51:28.079 align:start position:0%
education and career paths beyond the
 
00:51:30.530 --> 00:51:30.540 align:start position:0%
current approved stem courses now what
 
00:51:32.990 --> 00:51:33.000 align:start position:0%
we have now we do have a concurrent dual
 
00:51:36.589 --> 00:51:36.599 align:start position:0%
enrollment program uh moving and very
 
00:51:40.150 --> 00:51:40.160 align:start position:0%
active within this state we
 
00:51:42.530 --> 00:51:42.540 align:start position:0%
going back a number of years I remember
 
00:51:45.950 --> 00:51:45.960 align:start position:0%
when I worked with the the the
 
00:51:49.430 --> 00:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
chancellor Ross cattell and also at that
 
00:51:51.049 --> 00:51:51.059 align:start position:0%
time community college system I also
 
00:51:53.210 --> 00:51:53.220 align:start position:0%
worked with the chancellor Todd Leach
 
00:51:55.849 --> 00:51:55.859 align:start position:0%
from the University system New Hampshire
 
00:51:57.950 --> 00:51:57.960 align:start position:0%
University system of New Hampshire was
 
00:51:59.630 --> 00:51:59.640 align:start position:0%
not interested in this program at that
 
00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:00.770 align:start position:0%
not interested in this program at that
time

00:52:00.770 --> 00:52:00.780 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:52:03.890 --> 00:52:03.900 align:start position:0%
community college system recognized how
 
00:52:06.530 --> 00:52:06.540 align:start position:0%
this program right here has so many
 
00:52:09.109 --> 00:52:09.119 align:start position:0%
strengths and has moved forward and
 
00:52:12.109 --> 00:52:12.119 align:start position:0%
really done a great job but what we have
 
00:52:15.049 --> 00:52:15.059 align:start position:0%
now is we had a program back then
 
00:52:19.069 --> 00:52:19.079 align:start position:0%
that was built on the first year 850 000
 
00:52:23.150 --> 00:52:23.160 align:start position:0%
the second year 950 000 of the biennium
 
00:52:26.930 --> 00:52:26.940 align:start position:0%
and due to the fact of limited resources
 
00:52:30.109 --> 00:52:30.119 align:start position:0%
the cost of a course I believe was 150
 
00:52:30.119 --> 00:52:31.430 align:start position:0%
the cost of a course I believe was 150
bucks

00:52:31.430 --> 00:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
bucks
 
00:52:34.790 --> 00:52:34.800 align:start position:0%
um we we had only 10th 11th and 12th
 
00:52:36.290 --> 00:52:36.300 align:start position:0%
graders participating in the program
 
00:52:38.569 --> 00:52:38.579 align:start position:0%
since then we've expanded this to 10th
 
00:52:41.210 --> 00:52:41.220 align:start position:0%
11th and 12th graders we've also
 
00:52:43.549 --> 00:52:43.559 align:start position:0%
expanded the program and would like to
 
00:52:45.410 --> 00:52:45.420 align:start position:0%
expand the program by way of Statute
 
00:52:48.190 --> 00:52:48.200 align:start position:0%
here away from just the stem courses
 
00:52:51.530 --> 00:52:51.540 align:start position:0%
there are many courses that high school
 
00:52:53.210 --> 00:52:53.220 align:start position:0%
students have an opportunity to take
 
00:52:55.010 --> 00:52:55.020 align:start position:0%
while in high school concurrent dual
 
00:52:56.089 --> 00:52:56.099 align:start position:0%
enrollment where they're going to get
 
00:52:59.089 --> 00:52:59.099 align:start position:0%
college credit simultaneously with their
 
00:53:01.670 --> 00:53:01.680 align:start position:0%
credit their earning for graduation
 
00:53:04.309 --> 00:53:04.319 align:start position:0%
and they may be taking a course that's
 
00:53:06.890 --> 00:53:06.900 align:start position:0%
dealing with child care
 
00:53:09.230 --> 00:53:09.240 align:start position:0%
at the college or they may be taking
 
00:53:10.970 --> 00:53:10.980 align:start position:0%
some other course which is more of the
 
00:53:13.130 --> 00:53:13.140 align:start position:0%
liberal arts but not the stem-oriented
 
00:53:15.950 --> 00:53:15.960 align:start position:0%
type of course
 
00:53:18.470 --> 00:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
I had a daughter when we were living up
 
00:53:20.569 --> 00:53:20.579 align:start position:0%
in Alaska who took a course while she
 
00:53:22.250 --> 00:53:22.260 align:start position:0%
was in high school through UAA
 
00:53:25.569 --> 00:53:25.579 align:start position:0%
University Alaska Anchorage which had uh
 
00:53:27.650 --> 00:53:27.660 align:start position:0%
components of that college throughout
 
00:53:29.150 --> 00:53:29.160 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:53:31.670 --> 00:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
she took a course several courses while
 
00:53:35.150 --> 00:53:35.160 align:start position:0%
she was at at the high school there in
 
00:53:38.109 --> 00:53:38.119 align:start position:0%
town and those courses what she took
 
00:53:40.790 --> 00:53:40.800 align:start position:0%
simultaneously with what she took at the
 
00:53:42.410 --> 00:53:42.420 align:start position:0%
high school which she did get credit for
 
00:53:44.030 --> 00:53:44.040 align:start position:0%
the courses which is taken at the high
 
00:53:46.609 --> 00:53:46.619 align:start position:0%
school they applied to Elmira College
 
00:53:49.690 --> 00:53:49.700 align:start position:0%
where she went off to college and later
 
00:53:52.309 --> 00:53:52.319 align:start position:0%
down to the medical school in Charleston
 
00:53:53.690 --> 00:53:53.700 align:start position:0%
where king of speech pathologist
 
00:53:53.700 --> 00:53:55.130 align:start position:0%
where king of speech pathologist
audiologist

00:53:55.130 --> 00:53:55.140 align:start position:0%
audiologist
 
00:53:58.549 --> 00:53:58.559 align:start position:0%
so what happened we saw her spark when
 
00:54:01.609 --> 00:54:01.619 align:start position:0%
she took this course in child care from
 
00:54:05.329 --> 00:54:05.339 align:start position:0%
UAA and she learned hey I can do this
 
00:54:07.430 --> 00:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
and she didn't have all the confidence
 
00:54:09.290 --> 00:54:09.300 align:start position:0%
in the world that's what this does right
 
00:54:12.890 --> 00:54:12.900 align:start position:0%
here by STEM we are obviously going to
 
00:54:14.990 --> 00:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
be opening it up to more students now
 
00:54:18.230 --> 00:54:18.240 align:start position:0%
too in previous years it went from 850
 
00:54:20.990 --> 00:54:21.000 align:start position:0%
000 a year 950 000 for the second year
 
00:54:23.569 --> 00:54:23.579 align:start position:0%
of that biennium it's going up to 101.5
 
00:54:25.970 --> 00:54:25.980 align:start position:0%
million dollars but now we're jumping
 
00:54:27.589 --> 00:54:27.599 align:start position:0%
the number of students which can
 
00:54:29.690 --> 00:54:29.700 align:start position:0%
participate they can take not just two
 
00:54:32.210 --> 00:54:32.220 align:start position:0%
courses a year they take and can take
 
00:54:34.370 --> 00:54:34.380 align:start position:0%
five college courses these three credit
 
00:54:34.380 --> 00:54:35.990 align:start position:0%
five college courses these three credit
courses

00:54:35.990 --> 00:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
courses
 
00:54:38.630 --> 00:54:38.640 align:start position:0%
what happens when they take this and we
 
00:54:40.370 --> 00:54:40.380 align:start position:0%
we have the proof of the pudding right
 
00:54:42.890 --> 00:54:42.900 align:start position:0%
now that we have students doing this who
 
00:54:45.170 --> 00:54:45.180 align:start position:0%
are coming out with one semester and
 
00:54:47.210 --> 00:54:47.220 align:start position:0%
some two semesters accounts under their
 
00:54:49.190 --> 00:54:49.200 align:start position:0%
belts before they even get to the
 
00:54:51.290 --> 00:54:51.300 align:start position:0%
college doors
 
00:54:53.089 --> 00:54:53.099 align:start position:0%
that's a tremendous savings that's
 
00:54:55.609 --> 00:54:55.619 align:start position:0%
savings millions of dollars than part of
 
00:54:58.970 --> 00:54:58.980 align:start position:0%
families in terms of uh the the expense
 
00:55:01.430 --> 00:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
of courses at the post-secondary level
 
00:55:03.410 --> 00:55:03.420 align:start position:0%
thank goodness the courses at the
 
00:55:05.030 --> 00:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
community college system are a whole lot
 
00:55:07.190 --> 00:55:07.200 align:start position:0%
less than the Arthur University system
 
00:55:09.650 --> 00:55:09.660 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and with a two plus two
 
00:55:12.230 --> 00:55:12.240 align:start position:0%
program whereas you can take the two
 
00:55:15.049 --> 00:55:15.059 align:start position:0%
years which we worked at with a language
 
00:55:16.790 --> 00:55:16.800 align:start position:0%
last year and we've been working on that
 
00:55:18.829 --> 00:55:18.839 align:start position:0%
for a number of years the course is
 
00:55:20.630 --> 00:55:20.640 align:start position:0%
taken at the Community College Center
 
00:55:22.490 --> 00:55:22.500 align:start position:0%
applicable and applied towards your
 
00:55:23.930 --> 00:55:23.940 align:start position:0%
four-year degree
 
00:55:25.970 --> 00:55:25.980 align:start position:0%
so there's a savings right there you
 
00:55:27.589 --> 00:55:27.599 align:start position:0%
don't have to go to the four-year system
 
00:55:30.589 --> 00:55:30.599 align:start position:0%
to pay oodle some money and that we know
 
00:55:32.870 --> 00:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
that's really difficult and you look at
 
00:55:34.010 --> 00:55:34.020 align:start position:0%
the kids coming out of the University
 
00:55:35.809 --> 00:55:35.819 align:start position:0%
system right now
 
00:55:38.930 --> 00:55:38.940 align:start position:0%
I guess we're second to UVM in terms of
 
00:55:41.690 --> 00:55:41.700 align:start position:0%
college debt in this state for a
 
00:55:43.190 --> 00:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
four-year degree
 
00:55:45.230 --> 00:55:45.240 align:start position:0%
although we when it comes you hear the
 
00:55:47.750 --> 00:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
University Systems speak that well we
 
00:55:50.390 --> 00:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
may have a high debt but we have a very
 
00:55:53.329 --> 00:55:53.339 align:start position:0%
low default rate so the kids from New
 
00:55:54.710 --> 00:55:54.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and adults from New Hampshire
 
00:55:57.589 --> 00:55:57.599 align:start position:0%
we pay our bills but we still come out
 
00:56:00.290 --> 00:56:00.300 align:start position:0%
with a lifelong debt which makes it
 
00:56:02.690 --> 00:56:02.700 align:start position:0%
extremely difficult when you get that
 
00:56:04.790 --> 00:56:04.800 align:start position:0%
first job even to find housing or even
 
00:56:08.109 --> 00:56:08.119 align:start position:0%
you know to make your limited payroll
 
00:56:12.049 --> 00:56:12.059 align:start position:0%
take care of your daily uh costs so this
 
00:56:15.470 --> 00:56:15.480 align:start position:0%
bill extends the dollar amount to 3.25
 
00:56:18.109 --> 00:56:18.119 align:start position:0%
million dollars per year that will be
 
00:56:19.970 --> 00:56:19.980 align:start position:0%
used for the number of students which we
 
00:56:23.150 --> 00:56:23.160 align:start position:0%
have it will result in a tremendous
 
00:56:25.849 --> 00:56:25.859 align:start position:0%
Savings in dollars to families and
 
00:56:27.589 --> 00:56:27.599 align:start position:0%
students and adults at the community
 
00:56:30.710 --> 00:56:30.720 align:start position:0%
college system so I'm I'm going to be
 
00:56:33.170 --> 00:56:33.180 align:start position:0%
brief I think that's that you can read
 
00:56:35.510 --> 00:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
everything on the bottom there
 
00:56:37.730 --> 00:56:37.740 align:start position:0%
there was a report that I I pulled up
 
00:56:39.950 --> 00:56:39.960 align:start position:0%
last night and looked at uh in Colorado
 
00:56:42.530 --> 00:56:42.540 align:start position:0%
they did a research back in 2014 that's
 
00:56:44.870 --> 00:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
now you know eight years old but
 
00:56:47.329 --> 00:56:47.339 align:start position:0%
concurrent enrollment courses reduce the
 
00:56:51.290 --> 00:56:51.300 align:start position:0%
need for remediation remediation at at
 
00:56:54.950 --> 00:56:54.960 align:start position:0%
the college level by 11.2 percent kids
 
00:56:58.430 --> 00:56:58.440 align:start position:0%
see they can do it and then we have a an
 
00:57:00.290 --> 00:57:00.300 align:start position:0%
active number of youngsters and the last
 
00:57:03.609 --> 00:57:03.619 align:start position:0%
thing I want to impart to you is that
 
00:57:08.630 --> 00:57:08.640 align:start position:0%
we are one of the uh products that we
 
00:57:10.670 --> 00:57:10.680 align:start position:0%
deliver to other states in the state is
 
00:57:12.170 --> 00:57:12.180 align:start position:0%
our students for post-secondary
 
00:57:14.870 --> 00:57:14.880 align:start position:0%
Education many go out to get their
 
00:57:18.170 --> 00:57:18.180 align:start position:0%
education UMass Lowell at the University
 
00:57:20.930 --> 00:57:20.940 align:start position:0%
of mass Amherst at Orono University of
 
00:57:23.990 --> 00:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
Maine over to UVM they go and leave our
 
00:57:26.450 --> 00:57:26.460 align:start position:0%
state of those students
 
00:57:28.670 --> 00:57:28.680 align:start position:0%
less than half come back to our own
 
00:57:31.549 --> 00:57:31.559 align:start position:0%
state to do their jobs and work so we're
 
00:57:34.730 --> 00:57:34.740 align:start position:0%
losing our Workforce if we get kids
 
00:57:37.010 --> 00:57:37.020 align:start position:0%
involved in this concurrent dual
 
00:57:38.990 --> 00:57:39.000 align:start position:0%
enrollment in the high school and have
 
00:57:41.089 --> 00:57:41.099 align:start position:0%
them go on to post-secondary education
 
00:57:44.870 --> 00:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
in this state the likelihood of folks
 
00:57:47.450 --> 00:57:47.460 align:start position:0%
staying in the state is higher
 
00:57:49.730 --> 00:57:49.740 align:start position:0%
and therefore we have the workforce we
 
00:57:51.170 --> 00:57:51.180 align:start position:0%
can't afford to lose any of these
 
00:57:52.730 --> 00:57:52.740 align:start position:0%
students in this state we just don't
 
00:57:54.349 --> 00:57:54.359 align:start position:0%
have enough to fill our Workforce needs
 
00:57:56.329 --> 00:57:56.339 align:start position:0%
as it is right now so thank you very
 
00:57:57.710 --> 00:57:57.720 align:start position:0%
much I'll be glad to answer any
 
00:58:00.589 --> 00:58:00.599 align:start position:0%
questions thank you uh questions from
 
00:58:02.690 --> 00:58:02.700 align:start position:0%
the committee representative woodcock
 
00:58:04.250 --> 00:58:04.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Sharon good morning
 
00:58:07.309 --> 00:58:07.319 align:start position:0%
representative again yeah um
 
00:58:10.670 --> 00:58:10.680 align:start position:0%
structurally on the dual enrollment if a
 
00:58:12.770 --> 00:58:12.780 align:start position:0%
student takes the a class it's a
 
00:58:14.089 --> 00:58:14.099 align:start position:0%
two-part question actually if a student
 
00:58:16.250 --> 00:58:16.260 align:start position:0%
takes a class here and under this
 
00:58:19.130 --> 00:58:19.140 align:start position:0%
program I know it's transferable to our
 
00:58:22.490 --> 00:58:22.500 align:start position:0%
community colleges how is it is it also
 
00:58:25.309 --> 00:58:25.319 align:start position:0%
transferable as a college class say the
 
00:58:27.170 --> 00:58:27.180 align:start position:0%
UVM or you own
 
00:58:29.809 --> 00:58:29.819 align:start position:0%
asked Dr Rubenstein that I'm sure are
 
00:58:32.630 --> 00:58:32.640 align:start position:0%
you going to come up okay there's the
 
00:58:34.309 --> 00:58:34.319 align:start position:0%
man that you want to ask these technical
 
00:58:38.410 --> 00:58:38.420 align:start position:0%
questions to I okay all right
 
00:58:40.730 --> 00:58:40.740 align:start position:0%
yes yeah thank you
 
00:58:43.309 --> 00:58:43.319 align:start position:0%
um if I understand uh Rick I'm looking
 
00:58:46.490 --> 00:58:46.500 align:start position:0%
at lines three through 17. it's just the
 
00:58:48.890 --> 00:58:48.900 align:start position:0%
number of courses expanding from two to
 
00:58:52.329 --> 00:58:52.339 align:start position:0%
five yeah so is I mean is that
 
00:58:55.010 --> 00:58:55.020 align:start position:0%
is it possible for a student to take 20
 
00:58:57.109 --> 00:58:57.119 align:start position:0%
of these courses
 
00:58:59.630 --> 00:58:59.640 align:start position:0%
yeah that's too for for their you they
 
00:59:01.010 --> 00:59:01.020 align:start position:0%
could take it over the years that
 
00:59:02.809 --> 00:59:02.819 align:start position:0%
they're they're doing a 10th 11th and
 
00:59:05.450 --> 00:59:05.460 align:start position:0%
12th okay 20 courses and they could take
 
00:59:07.609 --> 00:59:07.619 align:start position:0%
15 courses then
 
00:59:07.619 --> 00:59:11.510 align:start position:0%
15 courses then
okay

00:59:11.510 --> 00:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:13.250 --> 00:59:13.260 align:start position:0%
that's high school math we're trying to
 
00:59:16.870 --> 00:59:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
okay then yeah anyhow 15 courses yeah
 
00:59:23.210 --> 00:59:23.220 align:start position:0%
yes and but if a student wants to take
 
00:59:24.950 --> 00:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
more than that they can do so but that's
 
00:59:27.770 --> 00:59:27.780 align:start position:0%
on on their own ticket if they go beyond
 
00:59:29.990 --> 00:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
the five in any given year and some are
 
00:59:32.530 --> 00:59:32.540 align:start position:0%
doing that okay thank you thank you sir
 
00:59:35.510 --> 00:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
representative cordiello
 
00:59:38.630 --> 00:59:38.640 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you good morning uh
 
00:59:40.370 --> 00:59:40.380 align:start position:0%
so my background is coming from
 
00:59:42.829 --> 00:59:42.839 align:start position:0%
four-year colleges where pretty much all
 
00:59:44.530 --> 00:59:44.540 align:start position:0%
of them have a required freshman
 
00:59:46.730 --> 00:59:46.740 align:start position:0%
composition class I imagine the
 
00:59:48.470 --> 00:59:48.480 align:start position:0%
community college system is similar in
 
00:59:51.530 --> 00:59:51.540 align:start position:0%
having a requirement like that so would
 
00:59:54.710 --> 00:59:54.720 align:start position:0%
this allow for students to fulfill that
 
00:59:57.109 --> 00:59:57.119 align:start position:0%
requirement in high school then
 
00:59:59.930 --> 00:59:59.940 align:start position:0%
maybe this is a question for well the
 
01:00:01.370 --> 01:00:01.380 align:start position:0%
courses of course are concurrent it's
 
01:00:02.530 --> 01:00:02.540 align:start position:0%
not stem
 
01:00:05.329 --> 01:00:05.339 align:start position:0%
from this so I guess I also want to
 
01:00:07.370 --> 01:00:07.380 align:start position:0%
state to you that the the instructors
 
01:00:09.589 --> 01:00:09.599 align:start position:0%
which made me high school teachers
 
01:00:12.829 --> 01:00:12.839 align:start position:0%
teaching this they must comply with the
 
01:00:15.650 --> 01:00:15.660 align:start position:0%
same rigorous standards that a professor
 
01:00:18.470 --> 01:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
or adjunct is required to have at the
 
01:00:21.349 --> 01:00:21.359 align:start position:0%
post-secondary level as far as answering
 
01:00:23.150 --> 01:00:23.160 align:start position:0%
your question specifically I think
 
01:00:25.970 --> 01:00:25.980 align:start position:0%
that's a a good one for the staff behind
 
01:00:25.980 --> 01:00:27.650 align:start position:0%
that's a a good one for the staff behind
me

01:00:27.650 --> 01:00:27.660 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:00:30.170 --> 01:00:30.180 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions from the
 
01:00:33.109 --> 01:00:33.119 align:start position:0%
committee uh seeing none uh thank you
 
01:00:35.329 --> 01:00:35.339 align:start position:0%
representative thank you
 
01:00:37.970 --> 01:00:37.980 align:start position:0%
and next will be chance the Rubenstein
 
01:00:39.890 --> 01:00:39.900 align:start position:0%
from the community college system
 
01:00:54.549 --> 01:00:54.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:57.349 --> 01:00:57.359 align:start position:0%
good morning and thank you for having us
 
01:01:00.950 --> 01:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
today thank you to representative Ladd
 
01:01:03.530 --> 01:01:03.540 align:start position:0%
who said probably everything that that
 
01:01:05.930 --> 01:01:05.940 align:start position:0%
we might think to say but I'll take a
 
01:01:07.910 --> 01:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
few moments to elaborate
 
01:01:10.370 --> 01:01:10.380 align:start position:0%
from the previous discussion about math
 
01:01:11.990 --> 01:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
learning communities some of the
 
01:01:14.150 --> 01:01:14.160 align:start position:0%
questions had to do with the challenges
 
01:01:16.549 --> 01:01:16.559 align:start position:0%
that students face and the the flip side
 
01:01:18.770 --> 01:01:18.780 align:start position:0%
of that for us dual enrollment one of
 
01:01:20.630 --> 01:01:20.640 align:start position:0%
the benefits is challenge a student
 
01:01:23.569 --> 01:01:23.579 align:start position:0%
who's looking for more rigor than they
 
01:01:25.250 --> 01:01:25.260 align:start position:0%
can find the opportunity to pursue
 
01:01:27.109 --> 01:01:27.119 align:start position:0%
college-level learning while still in
 
01:01:29.230 --> 01:01:29.240 align:start position:0%
high school because they're ready for it
 
01:01:31.549 --> 01:01:31.559 align:start position:0%
increases the likelihood that those
 
01:01:33.230 --> 01:01:33.240 align:start position:0%
students stay engaged with their
 
01:01:35.450 --> 01:01:35.460 align:start position:0%
education and have a sense of purpose
 
01:01:37.250 --> 01:01:37.260 align:start position:0%
for going to school and we think that's
 
01:01:39.589 --> 01:01:39.599 align:start position:0%
by itself beneficial
 
01:01:42.470 --> 01:01:42.480 align:start position:0%
it's also encouraging on a couple of
 
01:01:45.770 --> 01:01:45.780 align:start position:0%
fronts now one of those is a student
 
01:01:47.450 --> 01:01:47.460 align:start position:0%
encourage pursue the things that they're
 
01:01:48.950 --> 01:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
passionate about to learn more deeply
 
01:01:50.510 --> 01:01:50.520 align:start position:0%
about the things that they care about
 
01:01:52.789 --> 01:01:52.799 align:start position:0%
that may be outside of the normal High
 
01:01:54.230 --> 01:01:54.240 align:start position:0%
School curriculum
 
01:01:57.109 --> 01:01:57.119 align:start position:0%
but also the original intent of dual
 
01:01:59.210 --> 01:01:59.220 align:start position:0%
enrollment programs running start was to
 
01:02:00.770 --> 01:02:00.780 align:start position:0%
encourage consideration of
 
01:02:02.750 --> 01:02:02.760 align:start position:0%
post-secondary education for students
 
01:02:04.190 --> 01:02:04.200 align:start position:0%
who didn't believe that they could
 
01:02:05.930 --> 01:02:05.940 align:start position:0%
pursue College didn't think that that
 
01:02:07.730 --> 01:02:07.740 align:start position:0%
was going to be an opportunity whether
 
01:02:09.470 --> 01:02:09.480 align:start position:0%
because they didn't believe they had the
 
01:02:10.910 --> 01:02:10.920 align:start position:0%
ability or because they didn't think
 
01:02:12.890 --> 01:02:12.900 align:start position:0%
they could afford it
 
01:02:16.130 --> 01:02:16.140 align:start position:0%
in some ways that's still an important
 
01:02:18.470 --> 01:02:18.480 align:start position:0%
part of this but not simply the
 
01:02:20.089 --> 01:02:20.099 align:start position:0%
affordability I'll come back to that in
 
01:02:23.510 --> 01:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
a second and part of this is is the the
 
01:02:26.089 --> 01:02:26.099 align:start position:0%
affordability of time students don't
 
01:02:27.650 --> 01:02:27.660 align:start position:0%
like to feel like they're falling behind
 
01:02:30.289 --> 01:02:30.299 align:start position:0%
none of us do so the idea that you might
 
01:02:32.089 --> 01:02:32.099 align:start position:0%
want to do something different After
 
01:02:34.130 --> 01:02:34.140 align:start position:0%
High School whether it's military
 
01:02:36.109 --> 01:02:36.119 align:start position:0%
service whether it's to pursue a
 
01:02:38.450 --> 01:02:38.460 align:start position:0%
technical career whether it's to take
 
01:02:40.069 --> 01:02:40.079 align:start position:0%
some time to think
 
01:02:43.010 --> 01:02:43.020 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to pursue College while
 
01:02:45.410 --> 01:02:45.420 align:start position:0%
still in high school to bank academic
 
01:02:48.170 --> 01:02:48.180 align:start position:0%
credit toward a post-secondary degree
 
01:02:51.109 --> 01:02:51.119 align:start position:0%
give students more time encourages them
 
01:02:53.950 --> 01:02:53.960 align:start position:0%
to explore what makes sense for them
 
01:02:56.510 --> 01:02:56.520 align:start position:0%
again coming back to the fundamental
 
01:02:59.109 --> 01:02:59.119 align:start position:0%
early tenants one of them was in fact
 
01:03:02.150 --> 01:03:02.160 align:start position:0%
affordability as representative Ladd
 
01:03:05.089 --> 01:03:05.099 align:start position:0%
described this program saved students
 
01:03:07.809 --> 01:03:07.819 align:start position:0%
and their families significant cost
 
01:03:10.870 --> 01:03:10.880 align:start position:0%
this year we'll probably see students
 
01:03:13.670 --> 01:03:13.680 align:start position:0%
pursue 40 000 credits through the
 
01:03:15.710 --> 01:03:15.720 align:start position:0%
running Start program
 
01:03:18.650 --> 01:03:18.660 align:start position:0%
if that's at our tuition rates about
 
01:03:21.349 --> 01:03:21.359 align:start position:0%
nine and a half million dollars but
 
01:03:22.730 --> 01:03:22.740 align:start position:0%
those students and their families will
 
01:03:24.589 --> 01:03:24.599 align:start position:0%
pay less than two and for those who are
 
01:03:26.930 --> 01:03:26.940 align:start position:0%
taking the salmon the salmon CTE courses
 
01:03:29.210 --> 01:03:29.220 align:start position:0%
will pay nothing so in essence seven and
 
01:03:31.490 --> 01:03:31.500 align:start position:0%
a half eight million dollars of value
 
01:03:34.730 --> 01:03:34.740 align:start position:0%
transferred to those families in savings
 
01:03:36.410 --> 01:03:36.420 align:start position:0%
through through this investment that you
 
01:03:39.410 --> 01:03:39.420 align:start position:0%
make but as described earlier currently
 
01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
the scholarship is for two courses a
 
01:03:43.789 --> 01:03:43.799 align:start position:0%
year and to some degree that lends
 
01:03:45.309 --> 01:03:45.319 align:start position:0%
itself to more
 
01:03:48.230 --> 01:03:48.240 align:start position:0%
pick and choose more piecemeal approach
 
01:03:51.650 --> 01:03:51.660 align:start position:0%
to this at five credits or five courses
 
01:03:54.170 --> 01:03:54.180 align:start position:0%
a year rather a student can genuinely
 
01:03:56.870 --> 01:03:56.880 align:start position:0%
pursue a Year's worth of college a year
 
01:03:58.609 --> 01:03:58.619 align:start position:0%
and a half of college and if they choose
 
01:04:00.710 --> 01:04:00.720 align:start position:0%
to do some of this during summer as well
 
01:04:02.630 --> 01:04:02.640 align:start position:0%
can complete high school and
 
01:04:05.210 --> 01:04:05.220 align:start position:0%
concurrently an associate degree and I'm
 
01:04:07.609 --> 01:04:07.619 align:start position:0%
not suggesting any student needs to rush
 
01:04:09.890 --> 01:04:09.900 align:start position:0%
to finish two years I'm going to be
 
01:04:11.750 --> 01:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
lifelong Learners and they're going to
 
01:04:13.730 --> 01:04:13.740 align:start position:0%
spend their careers continuing to learn
 
01:04:15.589 --> 01:04:15.599 align:start position:0%
and reinvent what they need to know to
 
01:04:18.109 --> 01:04:18.119 align:start position:0%
to adapt to changes in their interests
 
01:04:20.329 --> 01:04:20.339 align:start position:0%
in technology and Industry
 
01:04:23.150 --> 01:04:23.160 align:start position:0%
but if in those two three years of high
 
01:04:24.710 --> 01:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
school with the challenge of dual
 
01:04:27.049 --> 01:04:27.059 align:start position:0%
enrollment courses these students can
 
01:04:30.049 --> 01:04:30.059 align:start position:0%
build that interest cultivate that
 
01:04:32.870 --> 01:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
lifelong learning that that passion for
 
01:04:35.870 --> 01:04:35.880 align:start position:0%
knowing then we can set them on a path
 
01:04:37.670 --> 01:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
that when they're ready for the next
 
01:04:39.710 --> 01:04:39.720 align:start position:0%
lesson the next thing they need to do
 
01:04:41.930 --> 01:04:41.940 align:start position:0%
they're prepared to do it and they're
 
01:04:44.450 --> 01:04:44.460 align:start position:0%
not carrying the significant debt that
 
01:04:46.910 --> 01:04:46.920 align:start position:0%
has historically been accruing for New
 
01:04:49.490 --> 01:04:49.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire students we think this is an
 
01:04:52.309 --> 01:04:52.319 align:start position:0%
opportunity to level the playing field I
 
01:04:53.870 --> 01:04:53.880 align:start position:0%
had an occasion I think with this
 
01:04:55.910 --> 01:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
committee before to reference the data
 
01:04:58.370 --> 01:04:58.380 align:start position:0%
on free and reduce lunches this state
 
01:05:01.670 --> 01:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
has a generation coming forward in high
 
01:05:04.490 --> 01:05:04.500 align:start position:0%
school k through eight K through 12 now
 
01:05:07.970 --> 01:05:07.980 align:start position:0%
who are going to find need and that need
 
01:05:10.549 --> 01:05:10.559 align:start position:0%
may be a barrier if we can provide the
 
01:05:12.470 --> 01:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
encouragement if we can demonstrate for
 
01:05:14.510 --> 01:05:14.520 align:start position:0%
them an affordable pathway if we pair
 
01:05:16.809 --> 01:05:16.819 align:start position:0%
this with last year's uh House Bill
 
01:05:19.730 --> 01:05:19.740 align:start position:0%
1530s initiated by representative Ford
 
01:05:21.349 --> 01:05:21.359 align:start position:0%
that builds Pathways from the community
 
01:05:23.750 --> 01:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
college system the university system we
 
01:05:25.849 --> 01:05:25.859 align:start position:0%
can ensure that this generation of New
 
01:05:27.829 --> 01:05:27.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire students has every opportunity
 
01:05:30.589 --> 01:05:30.599 align:start position:0%
that any student in the country has
 
01:05:33.650 --> 01:05:33.660 align:start position:0%
to live a good life and to pursue the
 
01:05:35.390 --> 01:05:35.400 align:start position:0%
education they need to be full
 
01:05:38.210 --> 01:05:38.220 align:start position:0%
participants as not just in the
 
01:05:39.950 --> 01:05:39.960 align:start position:0%
workforce but as engaged citizens
 
01:05:41.930 --> 01:05:41.940 align:start position:0%
informed citizens in their communities
 
01:05:44.990 --> 01:05:45.000 align:start position:0%
so thank you
 
01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:45.950 align:start position:0%
so thank you
foreign

01:05:45.950 --> 01:05:45.960 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:05:48.289 --> 01:05:48.299 align:start position:0%
thank you Chancellor if I just uh would
 
01:05:49.789 --> 01:05:49.799 align:start position:0%
like to add one thing and then be happy
 
01:05:51.230 --> 01:05:51.240 align:start position:0%
to answer a couple of questions that
 
01:05:53.089 --> 01:05:53.099 align:start position:0%
came up when representative Ladd was
 
01:05:54.829 --> 01:05:54.839 align:start position:0%
speaking I just wanted to mention that
 
01:05:56.750 --> 01:05:56.760 align:start position:0%
when when this program first started or
 
01:05:58.490 --> 01:05:58.500 align:start position:0%
the first year or two once it really
 
01:06:01.069 --> 01:06:01.079 align:start position:0%
sort of got its weight under it we saw a
 
01:06:03.530 --> 01:06:03.540 align:start position:0%
35 increase in running start
 
01:06:05.569 --> 01:06:05.579 align:start position:0%
registration running start being these
 
01:06:06.710 --> 01:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
courses that are taught in the high
 
01:06:09.890 --> 01:06:09.900 align:start position:0%
school by qualified teachers 35 increase
 
01:06:12.170 --> 01:06:12.180 align:start position:0%
in the registrations with probably a
 
01:06:14.089 --> 01:06:14.099 align:start position:0%
third of those or so happening in the
 
01:06:16.370 --> 01:06:16.380 align:start position:0%
Manchester area and that really told us
 
01:06:18.710 --> 01:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
that these were really benefiting
 
01:06:20.750 --> 01:06:20.760 align:start position:0%
families that students that were living
 
01:06:23.390 --> 01:06:23.400 align:start position:0%
in economically disadvantaged areas were
 
01:06:24.890 --> 01:06:24.900 align:start position:0%
able to take these courses when they
 
01:06:26.150 --> 01:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
didn't have the hundred and fifty
 
01:06:27.770 --> 01:06:27.780 align:start position:0%
dollars to take those courses when they
 
01:06:30.109 --> 01:06:30.119 align:start position:0%
weren't free so I think we've we've
 
01:06:32.390 --> 01:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
definitely seen that uh the benefit of
 
01:06:35.270 --> 01:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
of this program and with adding the
 
01:06:38.150 --> 01:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
English composition and just moving away
 
01:06:40.309 --> 01:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
from just them and CTE I think was your
 
01:06:42.650 --> 01:06:42.660 align:start position:0%
question about English comp English comp
 
01:06:44.690 --> 01:06:44.700 align:start position:0%
is our most popular running stock horse
 
01:06:47.569 --> 01:06:47.579 align:start position:0%
it is just about every High School in
 
01:06:50.270 --> 01:06:50.280 align:start position:0%
the state has it of course it's It's
 
01:06:52.130 --> 01:06:52.140 align:start position:0%
Complicated by the fact that the the
 
01:06:53.630 --> 01:06:53.640 align:start position:0%
teachers have to have the same
 
01:06:55.670 --> 01:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
credentials as our adjunct faculty do so
 
01:06:57.410 --> 01:06:57.420 align:start position:0%
they have to have an advanced degree in
 
01:07:00.109 --> 01:07:00.119 align:start position:0%
math in English but it is our most
 
01:07:02.089 --> 01:07:02.099 align:start position:0%
popular course and our most transferable
 
01:07:04.730 --> 01:07:04.740 align:start position:0%
and the courses do transfer to we know
 
01:07:07.130 --> 01:07:07.140 align:start position:0%
they transfer to well over 200 uh
 
01:07:08.809 --> 01:07:08.819 align:start position:0%
colleges and universities across the
 
01:07:08.819 --> 01:07:10.190 align:start position:0%
colleges and universities across the
country

01:07:10.190 --> 01:07:10.200 align:start position:0%
country
 
01:07:12.770 --> 01:07:12.780 align:start position:0%
um but you know certainly mostly in this
 
01:07:14.930 --> 01:07:14.940 align:start position:0%
New England area we don't see any
 
01:07:16.849 --> 01:07:16.859 align:start position:0%
problem with transferability for the
 
01:07:19.630 --> 01:07:19.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:22.849 --> 01:07:22.859 align:start position:0%
if I may add one last point and this
 
01:07:24.349 --> 01:07:24.359 align:start position:0%
actually director doran's point about
 
01:07:25.849 --> 01:07:25.859 align:start position:0%
academically qualified and
 
01:07:28.370 --> 01:07:28.380 align:start position:0%
representative Ladd also referenced them
 
01:07:30.529 --> 01:07:30.539 align:start position:0%
the requirements for the teachers who
 
01:07:32.329 --> 01:07:32.339 align:start position:0%
participate in this program and goes to
 
01:07:33.529 --> 01:07:33.539 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner's question about
 
01:07:37.010 --> 01:07:37.020 align:start position:0%
finding qualified faculty part of what
 
01:07:38.990 --> 01:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
we're requesting here is not just the
 
01:07:40.730 --> 01:07:40.740 align:start position:0%
scholarship support but program support
 
01:07:42.529 --> 01:07:42.539 align:start position:0%
because we'd like to be able to test
 
01:07:44.510 --> 01:07:44.520 align:start position:0%
some different approaches to doing this
 
01:07:46.789 --> 01:07:46.799 align:start position:0%
in some cases there are students in high
 
01:07:48.410 --> 01:07:48.420 align:start position:0%
schools where the teachers are not
 
01:07:50.870 --> 01:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
academically prepared to offer the
 
01:07:52.549 --> 01:07:52.559 align:start position:0%
college level courses based on our
 
01:07:55.370 --> 01:07:55.380 align:start position:0%
accreditation requirements so can we be
 
01:07:58.069 --> 01:07:58.079 align:start position:0%
more creative and engaging with our own
 
01:08:00.349 --> 01:08:00.359 align:start position:0%
faculty to deliver programs can we get a
 
01:08:02.289 --> 01:08:02.299 align:start position:0%
little bit further outside the the
 
01:08:04.069 --> 01:08:04.079 align:start position:0%
framework that was originally
 
01:08:05.690 --> 01:08:05.700 align:start position:0%
established to ensure that students
 
01:08:08.029 --> 01:08:08.039 align:start position:0%
regardless of high school have access to
 
01:08:11.410 --> 01:08:11.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:15.109 --> 01:08:15.119 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative miler thank
 
01:08:17.809 --> 01:08:17.819 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair could you please
 
01:08:20.809 --> 01:08:20.819 align:start position:0%
um expand on the concept of
 
01:08:23.809 --> 01:08:23.819 align:start position:0%
what is needed for a teacher in the high
 
01:08:26.209 --> 01:08:26.219 align:start position:0%
school to basically teach these
 
01:08:27.950 --> 01:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
particular courses what what is the
 
01:08:30.709 --> 01:08:30.719 align:start position:0%
difference between that high school
 
01:08:33.110 --> 01:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
teacher Visa be that of those who are
 
01:08:34.789 --> 01:08:34.799 align:start position:0%
aligned with the running Start program
 
01:08:37.189 --> 01:08:37.199 align:start position:0%
for example so it really depends on the
 
01:08:38.570 --> 01:08:38.580 align:start position:0%
course that's being taught there are
 
01:08:41.090 --> 01:08:41.100 align:start position:0%
different levels but traditionally let's
 
01:08:44.030 --> 01:08:44.040 align:start position:0%
say for a major level a a academic
 
01:08:46.130 --> 01:08:46.140 align:start position:0%
course such as English math History
 
01:08:49.130 --> 01:08:49.140 align:start position:0%
Science those teachers will need to have
 
01:08:51.890 --> 01:08:51.900 align:start position:0%
a a master's degree in that particular
 
01:08:54.590 --> 01:08:54.600 align:start position:0%
content area so a teacher will need to
 
01:08:56.209 --> 01:08:56.219 align:start position:0%
teach math they'll need a master degree
 
01:08:58.970 --> 01:08:58.980 align:start position:0%
in math not just a master's degree in
 
01:09:01.070 --> 01:09:01.080 align:start position:0%
educational leadership or something like
 
01:09:03.349 --> 01:09:03.359 align:start position:0%
that but in math if they don't have that
 
01:09:05.809 --> 01:09:05.819 align:start position:0%
master's degree we will accept a
 
01:09:07.849 --> 01:09:07.859 align:start position:0%
master's degree in something else such
 
01:09:09.769 --> 01:09:09.779 align:start position:0%
as educational leadership plus 12
 
01:09:13.189 --> 01:09:13.199 align:start position:0%
graduate credits in that particular math
 
01:09:15.709 --> 01:09:15.719 align:start position:0%
content area so it's either the full
 
01:09:18.769 --> 01:09:18.779 align:start position:0%
Masters or 12 graduate credits thank you
 
01:09:20.809 --> 01:09:20.819 align:start position:0%
for that clarification
 
01:09:23.570 --> 01:09:23.580 align:start position:0%
I think representative Luna
 
01:09:25.669 --> 01:09:25.679 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair thanks for
 
01:09:27.530 --> 01:09:27.540 align:start position:0%
joining us this morning
 
01:09:30.229 --> 01:09:30.239 align:start position:0%
um this may be I don't know if you've
 
01:09:32.090 --> 01:09:32.100 align:start position:0%
got got this at
 
01:09:34.070 --> 01:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
um at the ready or maybe uh maybe
 
01:09:38.329 --> 01:09:38.339 align:start position:0%
Shannon has has this but um but um was
 
01:09:39.829 --> 01:09:39.839 align:start position:0%
there an appropriation in the current
 
01:09:42.530 --> 01:09:42.540 align:start position:0%
budget for um for dual and concurrent
 
01:09:44.510 --> 01:09:44.520 align:start position:0%
and what how much was that
 
01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:51.070 align:start position:0%
and what how much was that
9.5

01:09:51.070 --> 01:09:51.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:52.910 --> 01:09:52.920 align:start position:0%
per year
 
01:09:56.209 --> 01:09:56.219 align:start position:0%
um and so so follow up on on this Mr
 
01:09:58.550 --> 01:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
chair so this one yes bring me up to a
 
01:10:03.830 --> 01:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
3.25 and um of the of the 1.5 was there
 
01:10:06.650 --> 01:10:06.660 align:start position:0%
any um uh any of that that was not
 
01:10:09.890 --> 01:10:09.900 align:start position:0%
utilized by um students
 
01:10:12.770 --> 01:10:12.780 align:start position:0%
a few years ago yes because when as I
 
01:10:15.470 --> 01:10:15.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned just pre-pandemic
 
01:10:18.110 --> 01:10:18.120 align:start position:0%
um when we had the 35 increase all that
 
01:10:20.030 --> 01:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
funding was spent when the pandemic hit
 
01:10:22.850 --> 01:10:22.860 align:start position:0%
the running start registrations took a
 
01:10:24.770 --> 01:10:24.780 align:start position:0%
pretty big hit as well
 
01:10:27.950 --> 01:10:27.960 align:start position:0%
um they decreased significantly for a
 
01:10:29.450 --> 01:10:29.460 align:start position:0%
variety of different reasons that we'll
 
01:10:32.149 --> 01:10:32.159 align:start position:0%
get into here but we're just climbing
 
01:10:34.910 --> 01:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
out of that now so uh we anticipate that
 
01:10:36.410 --> 01:10:36.420 align:start position:0%
this year we will spend all of that
 
01:10:38.870 --> 01:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
funding by the end of June okay good and
 
01:10:41.209 --> 01:10:41.219 align:start position:0%
and just a quick follow-up on quick
 
01:10:41.219 --> 01:10:42.290 align:start position:0%
and just a quick follow-up on quick
follow-up

01:10:42.290 --> 01:10:42.300 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:10:45.590 --> 01:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
um uh just to be sure uh when the when
 
01:10:48.890 --> 01:10:48.900 align:start position:0%
uh and I hope this this works out
 
01:10:51.050 --> 01:10:51.060 align:start position:0%
exactly how you you said that you expect
 
01:10:52.910 --> 01:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
this to be used up
 
01:10:55.189 --> 01:10:55.199 align:start position:0%
um if if the program's over subscribed
 
01:10:58.610 --> 01:10:58.620 align:start position:0%
are any students turned away or um or is
 
01:11:01.310 --> 01:11:01.320 align:start position:0%
it just a you know it
 
01:11:02.930 --> 01:11:02.940 align:start position:0%
something happens that's a great
 
01:11:05.149 --> 01:11:05.159 align:start position:0%
question because that did happen
 
01:11:07.490 --> 01:11:07.500 align:start position:0%
um a few years back and we did work with
 
01:11:09.770 --> 01:11:09.780 align:start position:0%
the Department of Ed to access some
 
01:11:11.270 --> 01:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
additional funding so no students were
 
01:11:13.970 --> 01:11:13.980 align:start position:0%
turned away okay fantastic thank you uh
 
01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:15.590 align:start position:0%
turned away okay fantastic thank you uh
representative

01:11:15.590 --> 01:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:11:17.030 --> 01:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:11:19.370 --> 01:11:19.380 align:start position:0%
taking my question several years ago the
 
01:11:21.050 --> 01:11:21.060 align:start position:0%
virtual Learning Academy Charter School
 
01:11:23.330 --> 01:11:23.340 align:start position:0%
had an agreement with Southern New
 
01:11:25.490 --> 01:11:25.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire University where the students
 
01:11:27.490 --> 01:11:27.500 align:start position:0%
could take
 
01:11:29.990 --> 01:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
dual enrollment courses and graduate
 
01:11:32.030 --> 01:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
with an associate's degree is there any
 
01:11:34.910 --> 01:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
potential for an option like that did
 
01:11:36.649 --> 01:11:36.659 align:start position:0%
you take that
 
01:11:36.659 --> 01:11:38.050 align:start position:0%
you take that
me

01:11:38.050 --> 01:11:38.060 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:11:40.669 --> 01:11:40.679 align:start position:0%
certainly yes we would love to and we
 
01:11:42.649 --> 01:11:42.659 align:start position:0%
actually are doing some things like that
 
01:11:44.209 --> 01:11:44.219 align:start position:0%
with uh with the New Hampshire Career
 
01:11:45.830 --> 01:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
Academy where students are able to come
 
01:11:48.229 --> 01:11:48.239 align:start position:0%
to our colleges and take
 
01:11:50.570 --> 01:11:50.580 align:start position:0%
um actually enroll in our colleges for
 
01:11:52.610 --> 01:11:52.620 align:start position:0%
the associate's degree and we also have
 
01:11:54.350 --> 01:11:54.360 align:start position:0%
something called the e-start program not
 
01:11:55.550 --> 01:11:55.560 align:start position:0%
sure if you're familiar with that but
 
01:11:58.189 --> 01:11:58.199 align:start position:0%
this falls into this bill as well estart
 
01:12:01.070 --> 01:12:01.080 align:start position:0%
is uh courses that are taught 100 online
 
01:12:04.790 --> 01:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
by our faculty so we offer up to 30 of
 
01:12:06.770 --> 01:12:06.780 align:start position:0%
those courses per year for students to
 
01:12:09.470 --> 01:12:09.480 align:start position:0%
take so that's another and that also is
 
01:12:11.510 --> 01:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
in conjunction with velac so velax
 
01:12:13.189 --> 01:12:13.199 align:start position:0%
offers the high school credit and we
 
01:12:14.930 --> 01:12:14.940 align:start position:0%
offer the college credit so that would
 
01:12:16.610 --> 01:12:16.620 align:start position:0%
be another way for students to earn
 
01:12:19.790 --> 01:12:19.800 align:start position:0%
significant credits follow-up yes thank
 
01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:20.570 align:start position:0%
significant credits follow-up yes thank
you

01:12:20.570 --> 01:12:20.580 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:12:22.390 --> 01:12:22.400 align:start position:0%
um so in order to
 
01:12:24.649 --> 01:12:24.659 align:start position:0%
have that degree conferred would
 
01:12:26.510 --> 01:12:26.520 align:start position:0%
students have to leave their public
 
01:12:29.870 --> 01:12:29.880 align:start position:0%
school and attend take vlax classes no
 
01:12:31.970 --> 01:12:31.980 align:start position:0%
how would that no no for each start
 
01:12:33.470 --> 01:12:33.480 align:start position:0%
they're actually still enrolled in their
 
01:12:35.390 --> 01:12:35.400 align:start position:0%
high school they just happen to get the
 
01:12:37.310 --> 01:12:37.320 align:start position:0%
high school credit from viva acts that
 
01:12:40.490 --> 01:12:40.500 align:start position:0%
they then transfer to their High School
 
01:12:43.669 --> 01:12:43.679 align:start position:0%
that question does also point to part of
 
01:12:45.890 --> 01:12:45.900 align:start position:0%
the reason why we're looking for some
 
01:12:47.750 --> 01:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
flexibility and we describe a number of
 
01:12:50.530 --> 01:12:50.540 align:start position:0%
different pathways
 
01:12:53.149 --> 01:12:53.159 align:start position:0%
as my colleague described we have
 
01:12:55.430 --> 01:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
partnership with velax when we do some
 
01:12:56.930 --> 01:12:56.940 align:start position:0%
things with Charter school but
 
01:12:58.430 --> 01:12:58.440 align:start position:0%
ultimately we want to give students as
 
01:13:00.830 --> 01:13:00.840 align:start position:0%
many options as possible one of the
 
01:13:02.990 --> 01:13:03.000 align:start position:0%
reasons that we tend to prioritize
 
01:13:04.790 --> 01:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
running stars that allow students to
 
01:13:06.470 --> 01:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
stay in their high schools and our
 
01:13:08.090 --> 01:13:08.100 align:start position:0%
experiences that the majority of
 
01:13:10.729 --> 01:13:10.739 align:start position:0%
students Thrive more in that setting not
 
01:13:12.290 --> 01:13:12.300 align:start position:0%
every student but for a lot of students
 
01:13:14.209 --> 01:13:14.219 align:start position:0%
they prefer to be able to engage in the
 
01:13:16.610 --> 01:13:16.620 align:start position:0%
other aspects of high school life while
 
01:13:18.410 --> 01:13:18.420 align:start position:0%
not giving up this opportunity for
 
01:13:21.110 --> 01:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
Challenger and rigor
 
01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:26.590 align:start position:0%
Challenger and rigor
foreign

01:13:26.590 --> 01:13:26.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:29.390 --> 01:13:29.400 align:start position:0%
thank you sorry Mr chair
 
01:13:31.790 --> 01:13:31.800 align:start position:0%
um thank you for taking my question I'm
 
01:13:33.290 --> 01:13:33.300 align:start position:0%
wondering if there's a minimum
 
01:13:35.930 --> 01:13:35.940 align:start position:0%
enrollment in the courses and schools
 
01:13:39.169 --> 01:13:39.179 align:start position:0%
that are a small student population are
 
01:13:40.970 --> 01:13:40.980 align:start position:0%
there issues at any times in terms of
 
01:13:42.770 --> 01:13:42.780 align:start position:0%
the school being well willing to offer
 
01:13:44.090 --> 01:13:44.100 align:start position:0%
the course
 
01:13:45.830 --> 01:13:45.840 align:start position:0%
because there's not that many students
 
01:13:47.870 --> 01:13:47.880 align:start position:0%
who might take it not typically we do
 
01:13:50.510 --> 01:13:50.520 align:start position:0%
have a minimum enrollment of five but
 
01:13:53.270 --> 01:13:53.280 align:start position:0%
we've years ago that was somewhat of an
 
01:13:54.770 --> 01:13:54.780 align:start position:0%
issue but we really haven't experienced
 
01:13:57.770 --> 01:13:57.780 align:start position:0%
that lately thank you
 
01:14:00.709 --> 01:14:00.719 align:start position:0%
yes representative McDonald thank you
 
01:14:03.169 --> 01:14:03.179 align:start position:0%
and thank you for being here
 
01:14:05.810 --> 01:14:05.820 align:start position:0%
um do you see the possibility of the two
 
01:14:08.270 --> 01:14:08.280 align:start position:0%
changes one to expand this to not just
 
01:14:10.310 --> 01:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
stem courses and the other to increase
 
01:14:12.290 --> 01:14:12.300 align:start position:0%
the number from two to five being broken
 
01:14:14.510 --> 01:14:14.520 align:start position:0%
into separate bills because although it
 
01:14:16.189 --> 01:14:16.199 align:start position:0%
is possible for a student to take five
 
01:14:18.350 --> 01:14:18.360 align:start position:0%
courses each year that would require a
 
01:14:20.090 --> 01:14:20.100 align:start position:0%
student who would have a lot of time to
 
01:14:22.310 --> 01:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
dedicate to the courses in addition to
 
01:14:24.290 --> 01:14:24.300 align:start position:0%
being highly motivated which yes is
 
01:14:25.850 --> 01:14:25.860 align:start position:0%
possible but I see as potentially
 
01:14:28.250 --> 01:14:28.260 align:start position:0%
unlikely so do you see the potential for
 
01:14:29.510 --> 01:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
this to be broken into two separate
 
01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:31.990 align:start position:0%
this to be broken into two separate
bills

01:14:31.990 --> 01:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:35.270 --> 01:14:35.280 align:start position:0%
who would think of that more as a
 
01:14:38.030 --> 01:14:38.040 align:start position:0%
legislative prerogative and decision if
 
01:14:40.490 --> 01:14:40.500 align:start position:0%
it were broken into two bills and one
 
01:14:43.130 --> 01:14:43.140 align:start position:0%
one were passed and the other not we
 
01:14:44.870 --> 01:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
would work with with what the
 
01:14:50.630 --> 01:14:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:52.370 --> 01:14:52.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr President Cordell
 
01:14:53.930 --> 01:14:53.940 align:start position:0%
appreciate it good morning and good
 
01:14:55.310 --> 01:14:55.320 align:start position:0%
morning once again
 
01:14:57.350 --> 01:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
um just a couple of structural things if
 
01:15:00.169 --> 01:15:00.179 align:start position:0%
I make is there any cost for the high
 
01:15:01.910 --> 01:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
school student at all
 
01:15:03.470 --> 01:15:03.480 align:start position:0%
to take this to participating this
 
01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:04.970 align:start position:0%
to take this to participating this
program

01:15:04.970 --> 01:15:04.980 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:15:08.030 --> 01:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
it's 150 dollars per course but if not
 
01:15:09.229 --> 01:15:09.239 align:start position:0%
if they have these scholarships
 
01:15:11.689 --> 01:15:11.699 align:start position:0%
available to them okay continue on that
 
01:15:14.630 --> 01:15:14.640 align:start position:0%
line follow up yes yeah thank you so
 
01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:15.649 align:start position:0%
line follow up yes yeah thank you so
um

01:15:15.649 --> 01:15:15.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:17.630 --> 01:15:17.640 align:start position:0%
the high schools let's make sure I'm
 
01:15:19.430 --> 01:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
understanding the program the high
 
01:15:21.950 --> 01:15:21.960 align:start position:0%
school offer course X currently in a
 
01:15:25.010 --> 01:15:25.020 align:start position:0%
stem area X and seven kids registered
 
01:15:27.229 --> 01:15:27.239 align:start position:0%
for that class you're using a high
 
01:15:28.189 --> 01:15:28.199 align:start position:0%
school teacher in the high school
 
01:15:30.770 --> 01:15:30.780 align:start position:0%
setting uh in the High School curriculum
 
01:15:32.930 --> 01:15:32.940 align:start position:0%
with the sort of like an AP piece but
 
01:15:34.790 --> 01:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
for Brian stock
 
01:15:38.390 --> 01:15:38.400 align:start position:0%
can other students take that class with
 
01:15:41.030 --> 01:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
that instructor with not wanting credit
 
01:15:43.189 --> 01:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
not having to pay hundred dollars they
 
01:15:45.229 --> 01:15:45.239 align:start position:0%
can yes okay
 
01:15:46.850 --> 01:15:46.860 align:start position:0%
um and just one more make one more
 
01:15:46.860 --> 01:15:47.870 align:start position:0%
um and just one more make one more
follow-up

01:15:47.870 --> 01:15:47.880 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:15:50.750 --> 01:15:50.760 align:start position:0%
yeah great how many
 
01:15:52.610 --> 01:15:52.620 align:start position:0%
um schools currently in the state
 
01:15:52.620 --> 01:15:54.350 align:start position:0%
um schools currently in the state
participate

01:15:54.350 --> 01:15:54.360 align:start position:0%
participate
 
01:15:57.229 --> 01:15:57.239 align:start position:0%
all of them every Public School in New
 
01:15:58.790 --> 01:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire participates and then we have
 
01:16:00.770 --> 01:16:00.780 align:start position:0%
many Charter Schools as well as private
 
01:16:02.990 --> 01:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
schools well thank you that's true I
 
01:16:04.850 --> 01:16:04.860 align:start position:0%
didn't know that thank you Mr
 
01:16:07.250 --> 01:16:07.260 align:start position:0%
of Representative Belcher
 
01:16:09.350 --> 01:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:16:12.350 --> 01:16:12.360 align:start position:0%
um I'm looking at the uh the Striking of
 
01:16:14.570 --> 01:16:14.580 align:start position:0%
the requirement that these be um stem
 
01:16:16.189 --> 01:16:16.199 align:start position:0%
and Career Tech
 
01:16:20.050 --> 01:16:20.060 align:start position:0%
would you say that it is a a reasonable
 
01:16:23.149 --> 01:16:23.159 align:start position:0%
concern that doing so
 
01:16:25.790 --> 01:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
could shift the underlying
 
01:16:28.310 --> 01:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
um utility of this program away from
 
01:16:30.950 --> 01:16:30.960 align:start position:0%
students seeking more
 
01:16:33.050 --> 01:16:33.060 align:start position:0%
um more rapid employment through either
 
01:16:36.490 --> 01:16:36.500 align:start position:0%
careertech or associates degree programs
 
01:16:39.709 --> 01:16:39.719 align:start position:0%
toward students looking more to fulfill
 
01:16:42.110 --> 01:16:42.120 align:start position:0%
general education requirements and such
 
01:16:43.790 --> 01:16:43.800 align:start position:0%
as Humanities and whatnot for a
 
01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:44.870 align:start position:0%
as Humanities and whatnot for a
four-year

01:16:44.870 --> 01:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
four-year
 
01:16:50.209 --> 01:16:50.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:52.130 --> 01:16:52.140 align:start position:0%
yeah well that's a thought-provoking
 
01:16:53.930 --> 01:16:53.940 align:start position:0%
question representing Belcher I think
 
01:16:55.970 --> 01:16:55.980 align:start position:0%
it's certainly possible but I think
 
01:16:58.669 --> 01:16:58.679 align:start position:0%
we're more likely to expand rather than
 
01:17:00.950 --> 01:17:00.960 align:start position:0%
just shift I think that this opens up
 
01:17:04.010 --> 01:17:04.020 align:start position:0%
opportunities the question posed earlier
 
01:17:07.250 --> 01:17:07.260 align:start position:0%
about workload a student may be less
 
01:17:09.350 --> 01:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
likely to take three or four stem
 
01:17:11.689 --> 01:17:11.699 align:start position:0%
focused courses but might be more
 
01:17:13.550 --> 01:17:13.560 align:start position:0%
interested in a balanced schedule of a
 
01:17:15.649 --> 01:17:15.659 align:start position:0%
couple of stem focused courses and a
 
01:17:18.290 --> 01:17:18.300 align:start position:0%
couple of humanities or or social
 
01:17:20.870 --> 01:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
science courses so I think it's more
 
01:17:22.610 --> 01:17:22.620 align:start position:0%
likely for the students pursuing this
 
01:17:26.510 --> 01:17:26.520 align:start position:0%
challenge to expand and broaden as
 
01:17:28.550 --> 01:17:28.560 align:start position:0%
opposed to just shift but I do
 
01:17:31.510 --> 01:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
understand the concern I'll say that
 
01:17:34.130 --> 01:17:34.140 align:start position:0%
internal to the organization one of the
 
01:17:37.070 --> 01:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
challenges that we face is that the more
 
01:17:39.169 --> 01:17:39.179 align:start position:0%
running Start program courses that we
 
01:17:40.729 --> 01:17:40.739 align:start position:0%
delivered I should mention that only
 
01:17:42.470 --> 01:17:42.480 align:start position:0%
about one in ten students who takes
 
01:17:44.570 --> 01:17:44.580 align:start position:0%
running start comes directly to us over
 
01:17:46.130 --> 01:17:46.140 align:start position:0%
the four or five year period we'll
 
01:17:48.709 --> 01:17:48.719 align:start position:0%
probably see 20 percent of those
 
01:17:49.970 --> 01:17:49.980 align:start position:0%
students but generally speaking these
 
01:17:51.830 --> 01:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
two so taking the education elsewhere
 
01:17:54.169 --> 01:17:54.179 align:start position:0%
but the more we do with running start in
 
01:17:56.689 --> 01:17:56.699 align:start position:0%
the areas like math like English and
 
01:17:59.030 --> 01:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
Humanities what it does is it
 
01:18:01.010 --> 01:18:01.020 align:start position:0%
concentrates the curriculum left for us
 
01:18:04.070 --> 01:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
to deliver in areas that are more more
 
01:18:07.850 --> 01:18:07.860 align:start position:0%
stem more Health Care More frankly more
 
01:18:10.189 --> 01:18:10.199 align:start position:0%
expensive to deliver it and so we are
 
01:18:13.010 --> 01:18:13.020 align:start position:0%
cognizant of that shift internally but I
 
01:18:14.390 --> 01:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
don't know that it changes the way
 
01:18:17.570 --> 01:18:17.580 align:start position:0%
students use the program
 
01:18:19.610 --> 01:18:19.620 align:start position:0%
if I could just follow up on that as
 
01:18:21.470 --> 01:18:21.480 align:start position:0%
well I agree with the chancellor that
 
01:18:23.990 --> 01:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
that's a great question and and one that
 
01:18:25.790 --> 01:18:25.800 align:start position:0%
I've thought about as well but I think
 
01:18:28.250 --> 01:18:28.260 align:start position:0%
when you're looking at five courses per
 
01:18:30.110 --> 01:18:30.120 align:start position:0%
student per year that that's a lot of
 
01:18:33.350 --> 01:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
courses at the college level so chances
 
01:18:36.770 --> 01:18:36.780 align:start position:0%
are not a lot of students will have the
 
01:18:39.830 --> 01:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity to take all five in that in
 
01:18:41.570 --> 01:18:41.580 align:start position:0%
in one year I mean many students will
 
01:18:44.149 --> 01:18:44.159 align:start position:0%
but it still will allow them to have
 
01:18:46.850 --> 01:18:46.860 align:start position:0%
some stem some CTE and some gen Ed
 
01:18:49.610 --> 01:18:49.620 align:start position:0%
courses so I I think it's it definitely
 
01:18:51.890 --> 01:18:51.900 align:start position:0%
will allow that that five allows us to
 
01:18:54.590 --> 01:18:54.600 align:start position:0%
kind of span all of the academic
 
01:18:55.970 --> 01:18:55.980 align:start position:0%
credentials that students might need
 
01:18:57.350 --> 01:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
when they're looking to go to college
 
01:18:59.990 --> 01:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
and you know we had originally thought
 
01:19:02.709 --> 01:19:02.719 align:start position:0%
about when when this program was first
 
01:19:05.630 --> 01:19:05.640 align:start position:0%
introduced that we would fund all it
 
01:19:07.669 --> 01:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be a limit to stem and CTE but
 
01:19:09.290 --> 01:19:09.300 align:start position:0%
at that time funding wasn't available
 
01:19:11.030 --> 01:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
you know very limited funding was
 
01:19:13.310 --> 01:19:13.320 align:start position:0%
available plus the focus at that time
 
01:19:16.130 --> 01:19:16.140 align:start position:0%
too was on stem very much very much on
 
01:19:17.510 --> 01:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
stem so that's why we went with this
 
01:19:20.270 --> 01:19:20.280 align:start position:0%
system and CTE due to lack of total
 
01:19:22.010 --> 01:19:22.020 align:start position:0%
funding that we would have wanted to do
 
01:19:25.490 --> 01:19:25.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:28.370 --> 01:19:28.380 align:start position:0%
yes representative Balboni
 
01:19:31.970 --> 01:19:31.980 align:start position:0%
thank you chair my question is again
 
01:19:33.950 --> 01:19:33.960 align:start position:0%
requiring going back to the high school
 
01:19:37.850 --> 01:19:37.860 align:start position:0%
requirements as well do you see these
 
01:19:40.189 --> 01:19:40.199 align:start position:0%
courses replacing the ones that they're
 
01:19:42.169 --> 01:19:42.179 align:start position:0%
already currently need to take for high
 
01:19:45.110 --> 01:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
school because it seems to me just going
 
01:19:47.930 --> 01:19:47.940 align:start position:0%
back from my daughter's experience in
 
01:19:49.910 --> 01:19:49.920 align:start position:0%
high school that her schedule was
 
01:19:51.410 --> 01:19:51.420 align:start position:0%
already really packed just taking the
 
01:19:53.570 --> 01:19:53.580 align:start position:0%
courses that you needed to take and then
 
01:19:56.510 --> 01:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
there were AP courses as well how would
 
01:19:58.490 --> 01:19:58.500 align:start position:0%
these courses fit in
 
01:20:00.410 --> 01:20:00.420 align:start position:0%
I think it's important to note that
 
01:20:02.149 --> 01:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
these courses do exist in the high
 
01:20:04.490 --> 01:20:04.500 align:start position:0%
school already so for example englishcon
 
01:20:07.310 --> 01:20:07.320 align:start position:0%
every High School senior needs to take
 
01:20:10.189 --> 01:20:10.199 align:start position:0%
Senior English so English comp is Senior
 
01:20:12.410 --> 01:20:12.420 align:start position:0%
English so that many of the you know
 
01:20:14.330 --> 01:20:14.340 align:start position:0%
whether it be psychology biology
 
01:20:16.970 --> 01:20:16.980 align:start position:0%
whatever it might be the course exists
 
01:20:19.610 --> 01:20:19.620 align:start position:0%
in the high school we just ramp it up if
 
01:20:21.470 --> 01:20:21.480 align:start position:0%
you will and teach it as ask the high
 
01:20:23.050 --> 01:20:23.060 align:start position:0%
school to teach it as a college course
 
01:20:26.450 --> 01:20:26.460 align:start position:0%
specific to our requirements for a
 
01:20:28.010 --> 01:20:28.020 align:start position:0%
college course so the high school
 
01:20:30.590 --> 01:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
teacher is teaching our College syllabus
 
01:20:33.110 --> 01:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
in that particular course for both high
 
01:20:35.990 --> 01:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
school and college credit I just hello
 
01:20:38.570 --> 01:20:38.580 align:start position:0%
yes I was just about to that so so who
 
01:20:40.189 --> 01:20:40.199 align:start position:0%
determines if that student would be
 
01:20:42.229 --> 01:20:42.239 align:start position:0%
ready to take that course would that be
 
01:20:44.750 --> 01:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
the previous High School right we rarely
 
01:20:46.610 --> 01:20:46.620 align:start position:0%
rely on the high school teachers and
 
01:20:48.410 --> 01:20:48.420 align:start position:0%
school counselors to ensure that
 
01:20:50.390 --> 01:20:50.400 align:start position:0%
students are ready for those courses all
 
01:20:52.370 --> 01:20:52.380 align:start position:0%
right thank you
 
01:20:54.890 --> 01:20:54.900 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative Tanner
 
01:20:56.570 --> 01:20:56.580 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
01:20:59.090 --> 01:20:59.100 align:start position:0%
question so what's the basic difference
 
01:21:02.410 --> 01:21:02.420 align:start position:0%
as I heard that between the AP courses
 
01:21:05.630 --> 01:21:05.640 align:start position:0%
and the running start courses as is it
 
01:21:08.270 --> 01:21:08.280 align:start position:0%
just the testing that um occurs with AP
 
01:21:11.870 --> 01:21:11.880 align:start position:0%
courses also a great question and yes uh
 
01:21:14.630 --> 01:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
for the most part the AP has its certain
 
01:21:17.270 --> 01:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
requirements obviously in our college
 
01:21:19.070 --> 01:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
courses have their certain requirements
 
01:21:20.810 --> 01:21:20.820 align:start position:0%
if you're if you're talking about the
 
01:21:22.729 --> 01:21:22.739 align:start position:0%
actual course content it's probably very
 
01:21:25.430 --> 01:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
similar like an uh an AP History course
 
01:21:27.590 --> 01:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
is probably very similar to one of our
 
01:21:29.330 --> 01:21:29.340 align:start position:0%
history courses that we're teaching is
 
01:21:31.430 --> 01:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
running start so very similar it's just
 
01:21:33.890 --> 01:21:33.900 align:start position:0%
the testing with the AP they need to
 
01:21:35.689 --> 01:21:35.699 align:start position:0%
pass the test for some colleges and get
 
01:21:38.630 --> 01:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
a four on it with our dual credit
 
01:21:41.090 --> 01:21:41.100 align:start position:0%
courses like such as running start then
 
01:21:42.770 --> 01:21:42.780 align:start position:0%
that college credit is pretty much
 
01:21:44.390 --> 01:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
transferable to any other college
 
01:21:46.729 --> 01:21:46.739 align:start position:0%
without having to take a test so we do
 
01:21:49.070 --> 01:21:49.080 align:start position:0%
see more students interested in taking
 
01:21:51.470 --> 01:21:51.480 align:start position:0%
the running stock courses versus AP for
 
01:21:53.450 --> 01:21:53.460 align:start position:0%
that reason
 
01:21:55.130 --> 01:21:55.140 align:start position:0%
follow up yes
 
01:21:57.649 --> 01:21:57.659 align:start position:0%
so I would assume that the the reason
 
01:22:00.590 --> 01:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
the AP courses has have a test at the
 
01:22:02.570 --> 01:22:02.580 align:start position:0%
end is to make sure of the quality of
 
01:22:04.850 --> 01:22:04.860 align:start position:0%
the the final project and that the the
 
01:22:07.250 --> 01:22:07.260 align:start position:0%
student actually qualifies for the
 
01:22:09.110 --> 01:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
college credit
 
01:22:10.910 --> 01:22:10.920 align:start position:0%
um has the Community College ever
 
01:22:14.630 --> 01:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
considered having some sort of of
 
01:22:16.850 --> 01:22:16.860 align:start position:0%
testing at the end of their uh running
 
01:22:19.010 --> 01:22:19.020 align:start position:0%
start course to make sure that it it
 
01:22:21.050 --> 01:22:21.060 align:start position:0%
actually the student is actually
 
01:22:23.030 --> 01:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
achieving what they should for the
 
01:22:24.890 --> 01:22:24.900 align:start position:0%
college the students are tested just
 
01:22:26.450 --> 01:22:26.460 align:start position:0%
like they would be in one of our
 
01:22:28.790 --> 01:22:28.800 align:start position:0%
colleges with the final exam and
 
01:22:30.770 --> 01:22:30.780 align:start position:0%
obviously testing throughout the entire
 
01:22:33.290 --> 01:22:33.300 align:start position:0%
course our College faculty work very
 
01:22:34.669 --> 01:22:34.679 align:start position:0%
closely with the high school teachers
 
01:22:37.189 --> 01:22:37.199 align:start position:0%
each running start teacher has a college
 
01:22:39.169 --> 01:22:39.179 align:start position:0%
faculty partner who works with them
 
01:22:41.030 --> 01:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
throughout the the semester to ensure
 
01:22:42.709 --> 01:22:42.719 align:start position:0%
the rigor of the college courses being
 
01:22:45.410 --> 01:22:45.420 align:start position:0%
upheld and actually will give the high
 
01:22:47.510 --> 01:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
school teacher their tests their college
 
01:22:49.790 --> 01:22:49.800 align:start position:0%
level tests to take if this the high
 
01:22:51.770 --> 01:22:51.780 align:start position:0%
school teacher so chooses if they don't
 
01:22:53.630 --> 01:22:53.640 align:start position:0%
want to use those tests then the the the
 
01:22:56.330 --> 01:22:56.340 align:start position:0%
college faculty partner will review the
 
01:22:57.649 --> 01:22:57.659 align:start position:0%
testing and all of the assessment
 
01:22:59.750 --> 01:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
methods to ensure the rigor of that
 
01:23:01.850 --> 01:23:01.860 align:start position:0%
college course is being upheld
 
01:23:01.860 --> 01:23:03.470 align:start position:0%
college course is being upheld
foreign

01:23:03.470 --> 01:23:03.480 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:23:05.750 --> 01:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
any further questions from the committee
 
01:23:07.850 --> 01:23:07.860 align:start position:0%
seen none thank you very much for your
 
01:23:09.890 --> 01:23:09.900 align:start position:0%
testimony and story and maybe we could
 
01:23:11.689 --> 01:23:11.699 align:start position:0%
get a card for you from for this bill as
 
01:23:11.699 --> 01:23:12.590 align:start position:0%
get a card for you from for this bill as
well

01:23:12.590 --> 01:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:23:15.649 --> 01:23:15.659 align:start position:0%
and uh with that I'll close the hearing
 
01:23:17.810 --> 01:23:17.820 align:start position:0%
on hb420
 
01:23:20.870 --> 01:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
and we're just about on time for the
 
01:23:25.850 --> 01:23:25.860 align:start position:0%
next bill which is HP 364 relative to
 
01:23:28.070 --> 01:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
transportation for students attending
 
01:23:30.649 --> 01:23:30.659 align:start position:0%
CTE centers
 
01:23:32.570 --> 01:23:32.580 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:23:35.149 --> 01:23:35.159 align:start position:0%
once again we will have uh the bill
 
01:23:36.790 --> 01:23:36.800 align:start position:0%
introduced by
 
01:23:45.110 --> 01:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:47.290 align:start position:0%
 
Le

01:23:47.290 --> 01:23:47.300 align:start position:0%
Le
 
01:23:49.970 --> 01:23:49.980 align:start position:0%
last year uh yesterday you know the
 
01:23:51.890 --> 01:23:51.900 align:start position:0%
yesterday during the dialogue two
 
01:23:54.110 --> 01:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars someone asked about
 
01:23:58.330 --> 01:23:58.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:02.090 --> 01:24:02.100 align:start position:0%
that's my guess yeah we have no bills
 
01:24:03.410 --> 01:24:03.420 align:start position:0%
available about today
 
01:24:06.770 --> 01:24:06.780 align:start position:0%
such a story to stick with it
 
01:24:15.770 --> 01:24:15.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:18.950 --> 01:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
at the end of the pyramids and all the
 
01:24:20.930 --> 01:24:20.940 align:start position:0%
bills are passed on the failure your
 
01:24:22.950 --> 01:24:22.960 align:start position:0%
local transfer statements
 
01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:31.149 align:start position:0%
local transfer statements
[Laughter]

01:24:31.149 --> 01:24:31.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:36.890 --> 01:24:36.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:43.970 --> 01:24:43.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:06.890 --> 01:25:06.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:06.900 --> 01:25:37.030 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:25:37.030 --> 01:25:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:39.950 --> 01:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
good morning again for 10 members of the
 
01:25:41.510 --> 01:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
education committee for the record my
 
01:25:43.970 --> 01:25:43.980 align:start position:0%
name is Rick Ladd I come from Haverhill
 
01:25:48.050 --> 01:25:48.060 align:start position:0%
and today I'm here to introduce HB 364.
 
01:25:50.709 --> 01:25:50.719 align:start position:0%
this is a bill relative to uh
 
01:25:53.510 --> 01:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
transportation of students to and from
 
01:25:56.750 --> 01:25:56.760 align:start position:0%
Career Technical education uh centers
 
01:25:59.750 --> 01:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
and Deals primarily with the costs of
 
01:26:02.450 --> 01:26:02.460 align:start position:0%
Transportation the process we we have
 
01:26:05.090 --> 01:26:05.100 align:start position:0%
developed in the state here to reimburse
 
01:26:08.510 --> 01:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
those sending schools for the cost of
 
01:26:10.729 --> 01:26:10.739 align:start position:0%
running those as buses or transportation
 
01:26:12.169 --> 01:26:12.179 align:start position:0%
that they use
 
01:26:15.350 --> 01:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
so in looking at the sheet that I handed
 
01:26:15.360 --> 01:26:17.209 align:start position:0%
so in looking at the sheet that I handed
you

01:26:17.209 --> 01:26:17.219 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:26:21.229 --> 01:26:21.239 align:start position:0%
and this is an older older sheet but it
 
01:26:24.530 --> 01:26:24.540 align:start position:0%
it tells it sends the message that
 
01:26:24.540 --> 01:26:25.729 align:start position:0%
it tells it sends the message that
um

01:26:25.729 --> 01:26:25.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:29.450 --> 01:26:29.460 align:start position:0%
how the transportation formula Works uh
 
01:26:32.810 --> 01:26:32.820 align:start position:0%
we have allocated as we heard yesterday
 
01:26:35.209 --> 01:26:35.219 align:start position:0%
nine million dollars each year for the
 
01:26:37.189 --> 01:26:37.199 align:start position:0%
cost of tuition and transportation of
 
01:26:39.590 --> 01:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
students to the Career Technical
 
01:26:41.810 --> 01:26:41.820 align:start position:0%
Education Centers and when we do that
 
01:26:43.370 --> 01:26:43.380 align:start position:0%
what we do with that nine million
 
01:26:45.770 --> 01:26:45.780 align:start position:0%
dollars the first thing we do is we
 
01:26:47.990 --> 01:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
subtract out of that nine million
 
01:26:49.669 --> 01:26:49.679 align:start position:0%
dollars and pay the districts their
 
01:26:51.770 --> 01:26:51.780 align:start position:0%
transportation costs
 
01:26:55.270 --> 01:26:55.280 align:start position:0%
the transportation costs are based upon
 
01:26:58.850 --> 01:26:58.860 align:start position:0%
the old formula we've had ever since I
 
01:27:03.470 --> 01:27:03.480 align:start position:0%
can remember 10 cents per mile per pupil
 
01:27:05.990 --> 01:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
if in fact the district does not provide
 
01:27:09.169 --> 01:27:09.179 align:start position:0%
those transportation services then the
 
01:27:11.870 --> 01:27:11.880 align:start position:0%
the board May approve thus transporting
 
01:27:13.610 --> 01:27:13.620 align:start position:0%
a student in their own personal vehicle
 
01:27:17.030 --> 01:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
at a cost of 25 cents per mile
 
01:27:20.030 --> 01:27:20.040 align:start position:0%
that is done in some cases where we have
 
01:27:23.030 --> 01:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
very few people riding the 60 some odd
 
01:27:26.750 --> 01:27:26.760 align:start position:0%
passenger bus the yellow bus and it's
 
01:27:28.310 --> 01:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
cheaper for them actually to drive
 
01:27:32.689 --> 01:27:32.699 align:start position:0%
themselves at 25 cents per mile there's
 
01:27:34.790 --> 01:27:34.800 align:start position:0%
also some students that are at the CTE
 
01:27:37.490 --> 01:27:37.500 align:start position:0%
centers that following the close of
 
01:27:39.590 --> 01:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
school on a given day they may have
 
01:27:42.169 --> 01:27:42.179 align:start position:0%
employment right there by the CTE Center
 
01:27:44.590 --> 01:27:44.600 align:start position:0%
so they can remain at the center
 
01:27:47.450 --> 01:27:47.460 align:start position:0%
transport themselves to the workforce
 
01:27:48.770 --> 01:27:48.780 align:start position:0%
job which they have that's in
 
01:27:50.470 --> 01:27:50.480 align:start position:0%
association with a Career Tech
 
01:27:53.390 --> 01:27:53.400 align:start position:0%
development program so there are some
 
01:27:55.250 --> 01:27:55.260 align:start position:0%
students that do that but the majority
 
01:27:58.850 --> 01:27:58.860 align:start position:0%
of our students now we and and the sheet
 
01:28:01.070 --> 01:28:01.080 align:start position:0%
that you'll see here the CT student
 
01:28:03.770 --> 01:28:03.780 align:start position:0%
population is running off the 9000. it's
 
01:28:05.209 --> 01:28:05.219 align:start position:0%
a little higher than that now I'm going
 
01:28:07.430 --> 01:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
to round it up to ten thousand but
 
01:28:09.590 --> 01:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
when you look at that the number that
 
01:28:12.110 --> 01:28:12.120 align:start position:0%
are transport is approximately 2 000
 
01:28:14.450 --> 01:28:14.460 align:start position:0%
students a little less than that
 
01:28:16.610 --> 01:28:16.620 align:start position:0%
because the remainder are already at the
 
01:28:18.110 --> 01:28:18.120 align:start position:0%
center because that's where the high
 
01:28:20.750 --> 01:28:20.760 align:start position:0%
school exists at that Center
 
01:28:22.490 --> 01:28:22.500 align:start position:0%
so when we're looking at this
 
01:28:25.370 --> 01:28:25.380 align:start position:0%
Transportation reimbursement let's look
 
01:28:27.169 --> 01:28:27.179 align:start position:0%
at the formula that we have right now
 
01:28:29.649 --> 01:28:29.659 align:start position:0%
the statutory language says we shall
 
01:28:33.110 --> 01:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
reimburse districts the full cost of
 
01:28:36.470 --> 01:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
Transportation full Transportation costs
 
01:28:38.510 --> 01:28:38.520 align:start position:0%
was put in the legislation
 
01:28:40.070 --> 01:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
can't remember if it was last year the
 
01:28:41.810 --> 01:28:41.820 align:start position:0%
year before that but we just recently
 
01:28:44.689 --> 01:28:44.699 align:start position:0%
did it when we knew that what they were
 
01:28:48.410 --> 01:28:48.420 align:start position:0%
receiving was not enough however now
 
01:28:50.570 --> 01:28:50.580 align:start position:0%
we're playing with the formula in terms
 
01:28:53.390 --> 01:28:53.400 align:start position:0%
of so what is full Transportation costs
 
01:28:55.970 --> 01:28:55.980 align:start position:0%
is that full in accordance with the
 
01:28:59.209 --> 01:28:59.219 align:start position:0%
formula or is it full in terms of the
 
01:29:02.390 --> 01:29:02.400 align:start position:0%
actual costs for transportation
 
01:29:04.910 --> 01:29:04.920 align:start position:0%
it's if it's full in in regard to the
 
01:29:07.430 --> 01:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
cost of transportation and the formula
 
01:29:09.830 --> 01:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
is 10 cents per mile
 
01:29:11.689 --> 01:29:11.699 align:start position:0%
if we were actually going to do this
 
01:29:13.550 --> 01:29:13.560 align:start position:0%
properly we'd have to put another two
 
01:29:15.110 --> 01:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
million dollars into that formula
 
01:29:19.010 --> 01:29:19.020 align:start position:0%
instead of 2.6 million dollars six 680
 
01:29:21.470 --> 01:29:21.480 align:start position:0%
000 approximately for transportation we
 
01:29:24.850 --> 01:29:24.860 align:start position:0%
should be formulate our funding annually
 
01:29:27.709 --> 01:29:27.719 align:start position:0%
2.6 million dollars
 
01:29:30.709 --> 01:29:30.719 align:start position:0%
that is you know that's much more than
 
01:29:32.570 --> 01:29:32.580 align:start position:0%
we can do because the remainder of the
 
01:29:34.310 --> 01:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
money there you can see out of that nine
 
01:29:37.850 --> 01:29:37.860 align:start position:0%
million dollars is used for tuition and
 
01:29:40.189 --> 01:29:40.199 align:start position:0%
the more students that participate the
 
01:29:42.290 --> 01:29:42.300 align:start position:0%
less tuition the students of the school
 
01:29:44.990 --> 01:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
the sending District receives in terms
 
01:29:46.850 --> 01:29:46.860 align:start position:0%
of the number of students that they're
 
01:29:48.770 --> 01:29:48.780 align:start position:0%
sending of course we're splitting up a
 
01:29:51.229 --> 01:29:51.239 align:start position:0%
limited pool of money for a growing
 
01:29:53.990 --> 01:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
population and so the schools receive
 
01:29:55.550 --> 01:29:55.560 align:start position:0%
less per child
 
01:29:58.010 --> 01:29:58.020 align:start position:0%
when you compare our our system here in
 
01:30:00.169 --> 01:30:00.179 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to Delaware which is a
 
01:30:03.590 --> 01:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
very similar uh location in terms of
 
01:30:06.590 --> 01:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
number of of students you can see that
 
01:30:09.410 --> 01:30:09.420 align:start position:0%
the state CTE funding for this state is
 
01:30:11.090 --> 01:30:11.100 align:start position:0%
nine million dollars when you look at
 
01:30:13.850 --> 01:30:13.860 align:start position:0%
Delaware it's 89 million dollars
 
01:30:16.129 --> 01:30:16.139 align:start position:0%
per year
 
01:30:19.850 --> 01:30:19.860 align:start position:0%
we are very much you know uh shorting
 
01:30:23.090 --> 01:30:23.100 align:start position:0%
our our CTE centers in terms of getting
 
01:30:25.010 --> 01:30:25.020 align:start position:0%
students to participate getting more
 
01:30:27.770 --> 01:30:27.780 align:start position:0%
students to participate many districts
 
01:30:29.750 --> 01:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
cannot send those students because
 
01:30:31.610 --> 01:30:31.620 align:start position:0%
they're not getting the reimbursement or
 
01:30:33.410 --> 01:30:33.420 align:start position:0%
the tuition Monies to send them to the
 
01:30:36.410 --> 01:30:36.420 align:start position:0%
CTE program so a lot of those 10 000
 
01:30:39.169 --> 01:30:39.179 align:start position:0%
students roughly 1 000 some odd number
 
01:30:41.030 --> 01:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
of them come from the sending districts
 
01:30:45.830 --> 01:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
that's that's a disservice to those
 
01:30:47.570 --> 01:30:47.580 align:start position:0%
districts would send we have a number of
 
01:30:49.490 --> 01:30:49.500 align:start position:0%
students which would love to take these
 
01:30:52.970 --> 01:30:52.980 align:start position:0%
courses in terms of you know agriculture
 
01:30:56.030 --> 01:30:56.040 align:start position:0%
diesel mechanics robotics Etc at the
 
01:30:58.189 --> 01:30:58.199 align:start position:0%
center but they're not able to do so
 
01:30:59.990 --> 01:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
seeing the district in order to do that
 
01:31:01.610 --> 01:31:01.620 align:start position:0%
has to fund up that money themselves
 
01:31:03.950 --> 01:31:03.960 align:start position:0%
without using this money right here it's
 
01:31:07.310 --> 01:31:07.320 align:start position:0%
basically an unfunded program which
 
01:31:09.350 --> 01:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
we're not going to you've totally fund
 
01:31:09.360 --> 01:31:10.750 align:start position:0%
we're not going to you've totally fund
properly

01:31:10.750 --> 01:31:10.760 align:start position:0%
properly
 
01:31:14.030 --> 01:31:14.040 align:start position:0%
so um what what we're proposing here if
 
01:31:16.189 --> 01:31:16.199 align:start position:0%
you look at the sheet that I that I
 
01:31:19.430 --> 01:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
stapled to this not the side where this
 
01:31:21.110 --> 01:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
morning when I they went down that you
 
01:31:23.990 --> 01:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
can see how bills are made like 188 cult
 
01:31:26.810 --> 01:31:26.820 align:start position:0%
Dash e colon 8 you see how things been
 
01:31:29.209 --> 01:31:29.219 align:start position:0%
scratched out and things are put in uh
 
01:31:31.070 --> 01:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
that's not the side I'm looking at I'm
 
01:31:34.930 --> 01:31:34.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:37.010 --> 01:31:37.020 align:start position:0%
had an audit done of their
 
01:31:38.990 --> 01:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
transportation system out there what
 
01:31:41.510 --> 01:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
they were doing for CTE and they I'm
 
01:31:43.910 --> 01:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
going to read part of it
 
01:31:47.770 --> 01:31:47.780 align:start position:0%
um and to you here the to Aid the United
 
01:31:50.090 --> 01:31:50.100 align:start position:0%
unified school districts in this
 
01:31:52.010 --> 01:31:52.020 align:start position:0%
endeavor the legislative appropriated
 
01:31:54.169 --> 01:31:54.179 align:start position:0%
funds for CTE Transportation Aid the
 
01:31:55.850 --> 01:31:55.860 align:start position:0%
amount of which is based on a formerly
 
01:31:58.610 --> 01:31:58.620 align:start position:0%
using type of vehicle
 
01:32:01.970 --> 01:32:01.980 align:start position:0%
mileage and the number of trips made to
 
01:32:04.010 --> 01:32:04.020 align:start position:0%
the college or to their location where
 
01:32:06.410 --> 01:32:06.420 align:start position:0%
they get the CTE you can see it's not on
 
01:32:09.050 --> 01:32:09.060 align:start position:0%
a per-pupal basis it's based on number
 
01:32:11.570 --> 01:32:11.580 align:start position:0%
of trips the types of vehicles Etc used
 
01:32:14.270 --> 01:32:14.280 align:start position:0%
for that we'd love to be able to you
 
01:32:16.790 --> 01:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
know use a smaller vehicle a van to
 
01:32:20.030 --> 01:32:20.040 align:start position:0%
transport a district of four or six K do
 
01:32:22.310 --> 01:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
we do do we then fund them at the same
 
01:32:24.350 --> 01:32:24.360 align:start position:0%
rate that we do the large yellow school
 
01:32:26.810 --> 01:32:26.820 align:start position:0%
bus The Yards large yellow school bus
 
01:32:30.590 --> 01:32:30.600 align:start position:0%
course uses more diesel it's more costly
 
01:32:32.030 --> 01:32:32.040 align:start position:0%
to purchase
 
01:32:34.189 --> 01:32:34.199 align:start position:0%
the school bus now we're talking what
 
01:32:36.890 --> 01:32:36.900 align:start position:0%
about 175 000 I may be a little shallow
 
01:32:38.750 --> 01:32:38.760 align:start position:0%
on that if it's electric it's four
 
01:32:41.689 --> 01:32:41.699 align:start position:0%
hundred fifty thousand dollars
 
01:32:43.910 --> 01:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
a van is much cheaper so its District
 
01:32:45.709 --> 01:32:45.719 align:start position:0%
would rather use something like that
 
01:32:47.629 --> 01:32:47.639 align:start position:0%
they can use it if they have it
 
01:32:50.629 --> 01:32:50.639 align:start position:0%
available but it would also cost less to
 
01:32:53.030 --> 01:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
run it if we did it by a new formula and
 
01:32:55.490 --> 01:32:55.500 align:start position:0%
that's what this bill is proposing that
 
01:32:57.350 --> 01:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
is proposing as they've done there you
 
01:32:59.270 --> 01:32:59.280 align:start position:0%
can see they have categories Suburbans
 
01:33:01.430 --> 01:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
and vans would get X number of dollars
 
01:33:03.169 --> 01:33:03.179 align:start position:0%
per mile
 
01:33:06.290 --> 01:33:06.300 align:start position:0%
um school bus so much and and school bus
 
01:33:08.990 --> 01:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
another level based upon it's up based
 
01:33:11.810 --> 01:33:11.820 align:start position:0%
on the formula now this bill doesn't get
 
01:33:13.610 --> 01:33:13.620 align:start position:0%
into the development of the formula this
 
01:33:15.830 --> 01:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
bill bill authorizes the Department of
 
01:33:18.950 --> 01:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
Education to work this out to figure out
 
01:33:21.350 --> 01:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
how are we going to set up our
 
01:33:23.570 --> 01:33:23.580 align:start position:0%
transportation costs and reimbursement
 
01:33:25.490 --> 01:33:25.500 align:start position:0%
to these school districts and it gives
 
01:33:28.490 --> 01:33:28.500 align:start position:0%
them this by anyone to do that and once
 
01:33:30.890 --> 01:33:30.900 align:start position:0%
that is established then we can flip
 
01:33:32.890 --> 01:33:32.900 align:start position:0%
over to a new process
 
01:33:35.629 --> 01:33:35.639 align:start position:0%
but we need to do something about this
 
01:33:37.490 --> 01:33:37.500 align:start position:0%
right now it's unfair The Way It Is
 
01:33:39.169 --> 01:33:39.179 align:start position:0%
We're limiting the number of students
 
01:33:40.910 --> 01:33:40.920 align:start position:0%
which can participate in these centers
 
01:33:44.510 --> 01:33:44.520 align:start position:0%
we did challenge the issue of calendars
 
01:33:46.910 --> 01:33:46.920 align:start position:0%
which are we have some centers which
 
01:33:49.250 --> 01:33:49.260 align:start position:0%
receive kids from nine different school
 
01:33:52.129 --> 01:33:52.139 align:start position:0%
districts with nine negotiated contracts
 
01:33:55.490 --> 01:33:55.500 align:start position:0%
for calendars Etc and getting them all
 
01:33:59.270 --> 01:33:59.280 align:start position:0%
on the same page is like herding cats uh
 
01:34:01.850 --> 01:34:01.860 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's just it can't be done
 
01:34:03.470 --> 01:34:03.480 align:start position:0%
well what we've given them that we've
 
01:34:06.050 --> 01:34:06.060 align:start position:0%
got to get not down to 10 non-conforming
 
01:34:08.990 --> 01:34:09.000 align:start position:0%
forming days in your calendar total for
 
01:34:10.669 --> 01:34:10.679 align:start position:0%
all those nine districts they're going
 
01:34:13.550 --> 01:34:13.560 align:start position:0%
to work on this and that legislation was
 
01:34:15.709 --> 01:34:15.719 align:start position:0%
just passed this last year and hopefully
 
01:34:18.470 --> 01:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
that will eliminate kids not being able
 
01:34:21.050 --> 01:34:21.060 align:start position:0%
to get over to the transfer to the CTE
 
01:34:23.149 --> 01:34:23.159 align:start position:0%
Center but the biggest thing which we
 
01:34:24.410 --> 01:34:24.420 align:start position:0%
got to address now is this
 
01:34:26.990 --> 01:34:27.000 align:start position:0%
Transportation reimbursement and then we
 
01:34:28.910 --> 01:34:28.920 align:start position:0%
got a tackle and another step in another
 
01:34:30.950 --> 01:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
build this bill initially was going to
 
01:34:34.189 --> 01:34:34.199 align:start position:0%
have tuition costs in there as well it I
 
01:34:35.930 --> 01:34:35.940 align:start position:0%
decided to break this down so we can
 
01:34:38.330 --> 01:34:38.340 align:start position:0%
tackle one thing at a time and then hit
 
01:34:40.970 --> 01:34:40.980 align:start position:0%
the tuition costs at another time so
 
01:34:43.250 --> 01:34:43.260 align:start position:0%
this can go includes in Nature's bill it
 
01:34:45.890 --> 01:34:45.900 align:start position:0%
deals strictly with looking at a new
 
01:34:48.290 --> 01:34:48.300 align:start position:0%
Transportation formula for the sending
 
01:34:51.850 --> 01:34:51.860 align:start position:0%
districts to the receiving CTE Center
 
01:34:54.229 --> 01:34:54.239 align:start position:0%
established by that would be established
 
01:34:56.629 --> 01:34:56.639 align:start position:0%
by the Department of Education so thank
 
01:34:57.950 --> 01:34:57.960 align:start position:0%
you very much I'd be glad to take any
 
01:35:00.950 --> 01:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
questions thank you any questions for
 
01:35:02.750 --> 01:35:02.760 align:start position:0%
representative Ladd representative
 
01:35:02.760 --> 01:35:04.669 align:start position:0%

01:35:04.669 --> 01:35:04.679 align:start position:0%
Belcher
 
01:35:07.729 --> 01:35:07.739 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Vice chair um
 
01:35:10.250 --> 01:35:10.260 align:start position:0%
I definitely uh agree and I'm on board
 
01:35:13.070 --> 01:35:13.080 align:start position:0%
with needing to sort this situation out
 
01:35:16.430 --> 01:35:16.440 align:start position:0%
my one my one question is is there a way
 
01:35:18.709 --> 01:35:18.719 align:start position:0%
to to guarantee in the rule making
 
01:35:21.350 --> 01:35:21.360 align:start position:0%
process or to instruct them
 
01:35:23.629 --> 01:35:23.639 align:start position:0%
to make sure that there's going to be a
 
01:35:25.729 --> 01:35:25.739 align:start position:0%
measure of efficiency ultimately so we
 
01:35:27.890 --> 01:35:27.900 align:start position:0%
don't wind up with a situation where
 
01:35:30.590 --> 01:35:30.600 align:start position:0%
school districts are you know sending
 
01:35:32.390 --> 01:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
one or two students long distances
 
01:35:34.310 --> 01:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
perpetually on full-size school buses
 
01:35:38.570 --> 01:35:38.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:41.209 --> 01:35:41.219 align:start position:0%
if we're going I'll take my district
 
01:35:43.970 --> 01:35:43.980 align:start position:0%
right now SAU 2023
 
01:35:46.550 --> 01:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
and our CT Center is across the river in
 
01:35:48.530 --> 01:35:48.540 align:start position:0%
Bradford Vermont and we're sending from
 
01:35:50.090 --> 01:35:50.100 align:start position:0%
Litchfield high school so we're talking
 
01:35:54.169 --> 01:35:54.179 align:start position:0%
maybe uh 30 to 40 minute ride depending
 
01:35:57.110 --> 01:35:57.120 align:start position:0%
upon what's going on in the highways we
 
01:35:59.149 --> 01:35:59.159 align:start position:0%
only have large buses
 
01:36:01.910 --> 01:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
so that's what we're using up there the
 
01:36:03.950 --> 01:36:03.960 align:start position:0%
smaller buses have been used for the
 
01:36:07.010 --> 01:36:07.020 align:start position:0%
special education services which we have
 
01:36:10.129 --> 01:36:10.139 align:start position:0%
um we we are a district which uh is very
 
01:36:12.709 --> 01:36:12.719 align:start position:0%
involved with the CTE Center across the
 
01:36:14.750 --> 01:36:14.760 align:start position:0%
river that's where the diesel mechanic
 
01:36:17.149 --> 01:36:17.159 align:start position:0%
program is taught and and that is
 
01:36:19.310 --> 01:36:19.320 align:start position:0%
critical to the agriculture Community
 
01:36:21.310 --> 01:36:21.320 align:start position:0%
from which I come from
 
01:36:24.169 --> 01:36:24.179 align:start position:0%
the the nature of the vehicle use is
 
01:36:26.689 --> 01:36:26.699 align:start position:0%
something that would be worked out would
 
01:36:29.330 --> 01:36:29.340 align:start position:0%
the department uh however we're not
 
01:36:31.250 --> 01:36:31.260 align:start position:0%
going to put you must do it in a smaller
 
01:36:32.629 --> 01:36:32.639 align:start position:0%
bus because there's there's another
 
01:36:35.870 --> 01:36:35.880 align:start position:0%
funding issue which we're not funding uh
 
01:36:38.629 --> 01:36:38.639 align:start position:0%
hopefully districts would get funded
 
01:36:40.310 --> 01:36:40.320 align:start position:0%
based upon a certain
 
01:36:42.530 --> 01:36:42.540 align:start position:0%
amount that's established in this bill
 
01:36:44.270 --> 01:36:44.280 align:start position:0%
if it's going to be a larger bus you're
 
01:36:45.530 --> 01:36:45.540 align:start position:0%
going to have to conform to what's going
 
01:36:47.810 --> 01:36:47.820 align:start position:0%
to be set up by the the department on
 
01:36:49.850 --> 01:36:49.860 align:start position:0%
that so I don't want to get in the
 
01:36:52.430 --> 01:36:52.440 align:start position:0%
business saying you will transport on a
 
01:36:54.110 --> 01:36:54.120 align:start position:0%
certain type of vehicle that's an
 
01:36:56.450 --> 01:36:56.460 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandate
 
01:36:56.460 --> 01:36:57.530 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandate
yep

01:36:57.530 --> 01:36:57.540 align:start position:0%
yep
 
01:37:01.250 --> 01:37:01.260 align:start position:0%
yes representative Cornell
 
01:37:04.250 --> 01:37:04.260 align:start position:0%
thank you I just want to make sure we we
 
01:37:06.530 --> 01:37:06.540 align:start position:0%
changed it I think last session so that
 
01:37:09.370 --> 01:37:09.380 align:start position:0%
Manchester got reimbursed
 
01:37:11.750 --> 01:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
this doesn't impact that they'll still
 
01:37:13.550 --> 01:37:13.560 align:start position:0%
get reimbursed yes and what
 
01:37:14.750 --> 01:37:14.760 align:start position:0%
representative Cornell and thank you
 
01:37:16.129 --> 01:37:16.139 align:start position:0%
representative Cornell for being on the
 
01:37:19.310 --> 01:37:19.320 align:start position:0%
CTE committee and they have looked at it
 
01:37:21.470 --> 01:37:21.480 align:start position:0%
and they're endorsing this what we had
 
01:37:24.530 --> 01:37:24.540 align:start position:0%
going on in Manchester also uh was it
 
01:37:27.410 --> 01:37:27.420 align:start position:0%
Nashua and extra you know it was three
 
01:37:31.129 --> 01:37:31.139 align:start position:0%
districts that we had in statute that if
 
01:37:32.810 --> 01:37:32.820 align:start position:0%
you're transporting within your District
 
01:37:36.410 --> 01:37:36.420 align:start position:0%
boundaries you're sending to a dis
 
01:37:38.870 --> 01:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
School in your District which is part of
 
01:37:41.149 --> 01:37:41.159 align:start position:0%
your school district so they never
 
01:37:43.310 --> 01:37:43.320 align:start position:0%
qualified because they weren't standing
 
01:37:45.850 --> 01:37:45.860 align:start position:0%
outside the parameters of Manchester
 
01:37:48.649 --> 01:37:48.659 align:start position:0%
we've changed that seeing that in
 
01:37:51.590 --> 01:37:51.600 align:start position:0%
Manchester you might have your CTE on
 
01:37:52.910 --> 01:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
the other side of town you could be
 
01:37:55.250 --> 01:37:55.260 align:start position:0%
transporting kids five miles or so and
 
01:37:56.629 --> 01:37:56.639 align:start position:0%
but they never received any
 
01:37:59.510 --> 01:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
reimbursement whatsoever for that that
 
01:38:02.270 --> 01:38:02.280 align:start position:0%
was changed so anytime you hop on a
 
01:38:03.770 --> 01:38:03.780 align:start position:0%
school bus no matter where you are in
 
01:38:05.990 --> 01:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
what district you will get reimbursement
 
01:38:08.030 --> 01:38:08.040 align:start position:0%
at that 10 cents per mile
 
01:38:11.390 --> 01:38:11.400 align:start position:0%
yeah representative miler thank you Mr
 
01:38:11.400 --> 01:38:12.229 align:start position:0%
yeah representative miler thank you Mr
chair

01:38:12.229 --> 01:38:12.239 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:38:12.239 --> 01:38:14.169 align:start position:0%
chair
so

01:38:14.169 --> 01:38:14.179 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:38:17.629 --> 01:38:17.639 align:start position:0%
364 basically is just directing
 
01:38:19.729 --> 01:38:19.739 align:start position:0%
the department to create a new formula
 
01:38:20.810 --> 01:38:20.820 align:start position:0%
is that correct there's no money
 
01:38:22.550 --> 01:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
involved in this it's just a matter of
 
01:38:26.330 --> 01:38:26.340 align:start position:0%
how to allocate that those funds in a
 
01:38:27.770 --> 01:38:27.780 align:start position:0%
different process is that correct yeah
 
01:38:29.330 --> 01:38:29.340 align:start position:0%
and we're trying to spell out we're
 
01:38:31.970 --> 01:38:31.980 align:start position:0%
trying to get away from this per pupil
 
01:38:35.390 --> 01:38:35.400 align:start position:0%
okay funding mechanism and looking at
 
01:38:37.610 --> 01:38:37.620 align:start position:0%
the trying to reimburse for the the
 
01:38:41.149 --> 01:38:41.159 align:start position:0%
costs of that bus moving uh you can't
 
01:38:44.270 --> 01:38:44.280 align:start position:0%
move a bus at 10 cents per mile if you
 
01:38:45.770 --> 01:38:45.780 align:start position:0%
only have four or five kids on it you're
 
01:38:47.950 --> 01:38:47.960 align:start position:0%
gonna have a loss
 
01:38:47.960 --> 01:38:49.910 align:start position:0%
gonna have a loss
representer

01:38:49.910 --> 01:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
representer
 
01:38:51.530 --> 01:38:51.540 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
01:38:51.540 --> 01:38:52.550 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
question

01:38:52.550 --> 01:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:38:55.010 --> 01:38:55.020 align:start position:0%
a lot of schools I think
 
01:38:57.110 --> 01:38:57.120 align:start position:0%
um contract with bus services I know
 
01:38:58.910 --> 01:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
when I coach tennis I would have like
 
01:39:01.310 --> 01:39:01.320 align:start position:0%
maybe 12 girls and we'd get a big bus
 
01:39:04.610 --> 01:39:04.620 align:start position:0%
and I think it would be so inefficient
 
01:39:07.209 --> 01:39:07.219 align:start position:0%
um but they told me that that they
 
01:39:11.510 --> 01:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
contracted per trip rather than you know
 
01:39:13.729 --> 01:39:13.739 align:start position:0%
how many students or what was the most
 
01:39:16.010 --> 01:39:16.020 align:start position:0%
efficient for them I guess that's that's
 
01:39:17.510 --> 01:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
kind of their problem I'm just wondering
 
01:39:20.209 --> 01:39:20.219 align:start position:0%
if this would interfere with
 
01:39:22.430 --> 01:39:22.440 align:start position:0%
um those schools that actually contract
 
01:39:25.189 --> 01:39:25.199 align:start position:0%
by the number of runs that are made and
 
01:39:28.669 --> 01:39:28.679 align:start position:0%
the mileage that the this won't impact
 
01:39:30.649 --> 01:39:30.659 align:start position:0%
that contractual basis at all what
 
01:39:32.149 --> 01:39:32.159 align:start position:0%
you're going to do is get from the state
 
01:39:33.649 --> 01:39:33.659 align:start position:0%
you're going to get X number of dollars
 
01:39:35.030 --> 01:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
for the number of kids which were
 
01:39:37.610 --> 01:39:37.620 align:start position:0%
transported on that particular bus if
 
01:39:39.470 --> 01:39:39.480 align:start position:0%
you've agreed as a school district that
 
01:39:41.149 --> 01:39:41.159 align:start position:0%
the contract is going to be based upon
 
01:39:41.159 --> 01:39:42.470 align:start position:0%
the contract is going to be based upon
runs

01:39:42.470 --> 01:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
runs
 
01:39:43.669 --> 01:39:43.679 align:start position:0%
um then you're gonna have to pay that
 
01:39:45.410 --> 01:39:45.420 align:start position:0%
but you're going to get reimbursed by
 
01:39:47.930 --> 01:39:47.940 align:start position:0%
the you know the mileage you know per
 
01:39:50.390 --> 01:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
mile per student that was transported on
 
01:39:54.590 --> 01:39:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:56.689 --> 01:39:56.699 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
01:39:59.270 --> 01:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
uh I have one representative lad if I
 
01:40:02.030 --> 01:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
could in terms of the costs um the bill
 
01:40:06.649 --> 01:40:06.659 align:start position:0%
takes effect in 2025 so
 
01:40:08.930 --> 01:40:08.940 align:start position:0%
um we have until or the department and
 
01:40:10.669 --> 01:40:10.679 align:start position:0%
the state board have until that time to
 
01:40:13.729 --> 01:40:13.739 align:start position:0%
come up with a new formula but at that
 
01:40:16.370 --> 01:40:16.380 align:start position:0%
point the new formula would kick in and
 
01:40:19.550 --> 01:40:19.560 align:start position:0%
there would be possibly costs involved
 
01:40:21.709 --> 01:40:21.719 align:start position:0%
for the state to provide the full cost
 
01:40:24.110 --> 01:40:24.120 align:start position:0%
of Transportation related to that new
 
01:40:26.330 --> 01:40:26.340 align:start position:0%
formula is is that correct that's
 
01:40:28.129 --> 01:40:28.139 align:start position:0%
correct and what we're doing is we're
 
01:40:29.770 --> 01:40:29.780 align:start position:0%
trying to put this off for several years
 
01:40:32.390 --> 01:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
when we've looked at the cost of running
 
01:40:35.330 --> 01:40:35.340 align:start position:0%
buses even for the rigor School District
 
01:40:38.810 --> 01:40:38.820 align:start position:0%
daily operations trying to get this
 
01:40:40.850 --> 01:40:40.860 align:start position:0%
information from doe has been very
 
01:40:43.490 --> 01:40:43.500 align:start position:0%
difficult uh you have bus supervisors
 
01:40:45.890 --> 01:40:45.900 align:start position:0%
and and and and people are familiar with
 
01:40:48.169 --> 01:40:48.179 align:start position:0%
it some it to try to sort through the
 
01:40:50.990 --> 01:40:51.000 align:start position:0%
doe 25 form and all that it's been
 
01:40:52.729 --> 01:40:52.739 align:start position:0%
extremely difficult to find out what the
 
01:40:55.189 --> 01:40:55.199 align:start position:0%
actual costs are and we've done this on
 
01:40:57.770 --> 01:40:57.780 align:start position:0%
the CTE committee two years ago when we
 
01:41:00.910 --> 01:41:00.920 align:start position:0%
were looking at the how the formula
 
01:41:05.090 --> 01:41:05.100 align:start position:0%
works and it's a very convoluted formula
 
01:41:06.970 --> 01:41:06.980 align:start position:0%
when you come to tuition
 
01:41:09.169 --> 01:41:09.179 align:start position:0%
Transportation trying to get a handle
 
01:41:11.270 --> 01:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
how much we're actually spending in all
 
01:41:13.910 --> 01:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
and how it is also it's not as
 
01:41:15.890 --> 01:41:15.900 align:start position:0%
complicated as a tuition formula which
 
01:41:18.830 --> 01:41:18.840 align:start position:0%
is more more based upon the local makes
 
01:41:20.810 --> 01:41:20.820 align:start position:0%
that decision between 20 and 40 percent
 
01:41:23.510 --> 01:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
of the doe costs you know of the doe 25
 
01:41:26.390 --> 01:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
per people cost and then there's a three
 
01:41:28.970 --> 01:41:28.980 align:start position:0%
percent added on that for Capital uh
 
01:41:31.729 --> 01:41:31.739 align:start position:0%
costs as well so it's a lot of this has
 
01:41:33.050 --> 01:41:33.060 align:start position:0%
to be looked at I'm trying to go
 
01:41:35.689 --> 01:41:35.699 align:start position:0%
incrementally here and work with Jeff
 
01:41:38.629 --> 01:41:38.639 align:start position:0%
beard behind me here uh regarding uh
 
01:41:42.410 --> 01:41:42.420 align:start position:0%
let's fix the transportation costs first
 
01:41:44.270 --> 01:41:44.280 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions so
 
01:41:46.370 --> 01:41:46.380 align:start position:0%
representative Luna thanks very much Mr
 
01:41:48.169 --> 01:41:48.179 align:start position:0%
chairman follow on to what what you just
 
01:41:50.090 --> 01:41:50.100 align:start position:0%
asked with respect to the effective date
 
01:41:52.790 --> 01:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't we accelerate this to uh
 
01:41:55.790 --> 01:41:55.800 align:start position:0%
July 1st 2024. hey I'm all for it I'm
 
01:41:58.010 --> 01:41:58.020 align:start position:0%
all for it what we also have I haven't
 
01:41:59.629 --> 01:41:59.639 align:start position:0%
mentioned we have two other bills which
 
01:42:02.030 --> 01:42:02.040 align:start position:0%
are coming down dealing with
 
01:42:02.040 --> 01:42:07.930 align:start position:0%
are coming down dealing with
um

01:42:07.930 --> 01:42:07.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:09.590 --> 01:42:09.600 align:start position:0%
Capital Capital Improvements for
 
01:42:11.990 --> 01:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
building so no so let's let's just stay
 
01:42:14.810 --> 01:42:14.820 align:start position:0%
here by this one yes I agree if the
 
01:42:16.850 --> 01:42:16.860 align:start position:0%
timeline can be changed if we hear from
 
01:42:18.530 --> 01:42:18.540 align:start position:0%
folks behind me well we could do this
 
01:42:20.810 --> 01:42:20.820 align:start position:0%
earlier and and we should I'm all for
 
01:42:24.229 --> 01:42:24.239 align:start position:0%
that yeah okay any further questions for
 
01:42:27.050 --> 01:42:27.060 align:start position:0%
representative Ladd uh see none
 
01:42:28.310 --> 01:42:28.320 align:start position:0%
um we do have someone from the
 
01:42:30.350 --> 01:42:30.360 align:start position:0%
Department here if there are any uh
 
01:42:32.450 --> 01:42:32.460 align:start position:0%
technical support questions
 
01:42:35.570 --> 01:42:35.580 align:start position:0%
stop that anyone has for for the
 
01:42:35.580 --> 01:42:37.550 align:start position:0%
stop that anyone has for for the
Department

01:42:37.550 --> 01:42:37.560 align:start position:0%
Department
 
01:42:40.790 --> 01:42:40.800 align:start position:0%

representative Alexander
 
02:01:26.629 --> 02:01:26.639 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you members of
 
02:01:28.370 --> 02:01:28.380 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record my name is
 
02:01:29.990 --> 02:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
representative Joe Alexander I represent
 
02:01:32.270 --> 02:01:32.280 align:start position:0%
the town of Goffstown I actually um
 
02:01:33.830 --> 02:01:33.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me to testify at
 
02:01:36.169 --> 02:01:36.179 align:start position:0%
education committee I have a former
 
02:01:37.850 --> 02:01:37.860 align:start position:0%
Professor college professor on this
 
02:01:39.589 --> 02:01:39.599 align:start position:0%
committee now so I hope she's very proud
 
02:01:43.070 --> 02:01:43.080 align:start position:0%
of me testifying in this committee so HP
 
02:01:45.169 --> 02:01:45.179 align:start position:0%
267 I believe is a simple piece of
 
02:01:47.750 --> 02:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
legislation I put it I put in this bill
 
02:01:49.370 --> 02:01:49.380 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the superintendent of the
 
02:01:52.850 --> 02:01:52.860 align:start position:0%
Goffstown School District so he is here
 
02:01:55.689 --> 02:01:55.699 align:start position:0%
to testify as well to provide clarifying
 
02:01:59.030 --> 02:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
to answer questions if there are any I
 
02:02:00.169 --> 02:02:00.179 align:start position:0%
believe it's a simple bill that would
 
02:02:01.550 --> 02:02:01.560 align:start position:0%
merely enable a school administrative
 
02:02:04.189 --> 02:02:04.199 align:start position:0%
unit or School District to require more
 
02:02:04.199 --> 02:02:05.390 align:start position:0%
unit or School District to require more
frequent

02:02:05.390 --> 02:02:05.400 align:start position:0%
frequent
 
02:02:05.400 --> 02:02:06.109 align:start position:0%
frequent
um

02:02:06.109 --> 02:02:06.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:07.729 --> 02:02:07.739 align:start position:0%
background checks or criminal record
 
02:02:10.430 --> 02:02:10.440 align:start position:0%
checks this would apply to all employees
 
02:02:12.410 --> 02:02:12.420 align:start position:0%
and volunteers not specific groups but
 
02:02:13.669 --> 02:02:13.679 align:start position:0%
everybody that works in a school
 
02:02:15.890 --> 02:02:15.900 align:start position:0%
district in the current statute only
 
02:02:18.290 --> 02:02:18.300 align:start position:0%
requires one criminal history check upon
 
02:02:20.750 --> 02:02:20.760 align:start position:0%
hiring and non-like none immediately
 
02:02:23.930 --> 02:02:23.940 align:start position:0%
after or following so you can get a
 
02:02:25.129 --> 02:02:25.139 align:start position:0%
situation where someone works for a
 
02:02:26.510 --> 02:02:26.520 align:start position:0%
school district for 30 years and only
 
02:02:29.209 --> 02:02:29.219 align:start position:0%
has one background check so this merely
 
02:02:31.550 --> 02:02:31.560 align:start position:0%
would just enable during contract
 
02:02:33.530 --> 02:02:33.540 align:start position:0%
negotiations more frequent background
 
02:02:35.689 --> 02:02:35.699 align:start position:0%
checks but this is totally a local
 
02:02:37.430 --> 02:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
control bill so it allows school
 
02:02:40.370 --> 02:02:40.380 align:start position:0%
district and you know groups unions or
 
02:02:41.930 --> 02:02:41.940 align:start position:0%
anybody to have those negotiations on
 
02:02:44.330 --> 02:02:44.340 align:start position:0%
their own and local level so my ask is
 
02:02:46.609 --> 02:02:46.619 align:start position:0%
that you support the bill and you know
 
02:02:48.229 --> 02:02:48.239 align:start position:0%
my superintendent is here to give
 
02:02:49.850 --> 02:02:49.860 align:start position:0%
specific situations where it might be
 
02:02:52.010 --> 02:02:52.020 align:start position:0%
needed and so I'm happy to answer
 
02:02:53.689 --> 02:02:53.699 align:start position:0%
questions but also defer to my
 
02:02:55.490 --> 02:02:55.500 align:start position:0%
superintendent so thank you thank you
 
02:02:57.109 --> 02:02:57.119 align:start position:0%
very much representative are there any
 
02:02:59.689 --> 02:02:59.699 align:start position:0%
questions of Representative yes go ahead
 
02:03:01.209 --> 02:03:01.219 align:start position:0%
and represent Belcher
 
02:03:03.410 --> 02:03:03.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
02:03:05.149 --> 02:03:05.159 align:start position:0%
um do you know if is there any
 
02:03:06.830 --> 02:03:06.840 align:start position:0%
requirement in law
 
02:03:09.410 --> 02:03:09.420 align:start position:0%
um that the school or the or the
 
02:03:13.250 --> 02:03:13.260 align:start position:0%
requesting agency pay for the background
 
02:03:14.930 --> 02:03:14.940 align:start position:0%
check does it ever fall to the person
 
02:03:17.629 --> 02:03:17.639 align:start position:0%
being checked
 
02:03:19.550 --> 02:03:19.560 align:start position:0%
um it's my understanding that it's the
 
02:03:20.810 --> 02:03:20.820 align:start position:0%
school district that pays for those
 
02:03:22.430 --> 02:03:22.440 align:start position:0%
background checks but again that could
 
02:03:24.169 --> 02:03:24.179 align:start position:0%
be part of those negotiations that
 
02:03:26.689 --> 02:03:26.699 align:start position:0%
happen on the local level between the
 
02:03:29.510 --> 02:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
school district and any groups thank you
 
02:03:29.520 --> 02:03:30.950 align:start position:0%
school district and any groups thank you
yep

02:03:30.950 --> 02:03:30.960 align:start position:0%
yep
 
02:03:33.290 --> 02:03:33.300 align:start position:0%
go ahead representative
 
02:03:35.330 --> 02:03:35.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you Mr
 
02:03:37.910 --> 02:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
Alexander representative uh Alexander
 
02:03:39.709 --> 02:03:39.719 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
02:03:42.050 --> 02:03:42.060 align:start position:0%
um many people have background checks
 
02:03:44.330 --> 02:03:44.340 align:start position:0%
for other aspects of their lives for
 
02:03:46.669 --> 02:03:46.679 align:start position:0%
example uh coaching or something or
 
02:03:49.570 --> 02:03:49.580 align:start position:0%
other other employment would you accept
 
02:03:52.850 --> 02:03:52.860 align:start position:0%
a recent background check from another
 
02:03:56.570 --> 02:03:56.580 align:start position:0%
source as to fulfill these obligations
 
02:03:58.669 --> 02:03:58.679 align:start position:0%
so I think my superintendent can help
 
02:04:00.589 --> 02:04:00.599 align:start position:0%
with this but I would say that
 
02:04:02.450 --> 02:04:02.460 align:start position:0%
um that is all going to be a part of
 
02:04:04.430 --> 02:04:04.440 align:start position:0%
that negotiation that happens on the
 
02:04:05.990 --> 02:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
local level so they can have that
 
02:04:08.149 --> 02:04:08.159 align:start position:0%
conversation about you know if you have
 
02:04:10.129 --> 02:04:10.139 align:start position:0%
say they were they happen to agree to
 
02:04:12.649 --> 02:04:12.659 align:start position:0%
requirement every 10 years and they
 
02:04:14.030 --> 02:04:14.040 align:start position:0%
happen to have a more recent one for
 
02:04:16.129 --> 02:04:16.139 align:start position:0%
some other position that could be part
 
02:04:17.629 --> 02:04:17.639 align:start position:0%
of the language that's put into the
 
02:04:17.639 --> 02:04:20.209 align:start position:0%
of the language that's put into the
contract

02:04:20.209 --> 02:04:20.219 align:start position:0%
contract
 
02:04:22.129 --> 02:04:22.139 align:start position:0%
further questions representative nyler

uh when they negotiate the the
 
02:04:33.350 --> 02:04:33.360 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining agreement or I I
 
02:04:35.390 --> 02:04:35.400 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure the reference when you use
 
02:04:37.669 --> 02:04:37.679 align:start position:0%
the term negotiations that means one
 
02:04:39.709 --> 02:04:39.719 align:start position:0%
thing to me I'm not sure what that means
 
02:04:40.910 --> 02:04:40.920 align:start position:0%
to you
 
02:04:42.589 --> 02:04:42.599 align:start position:0%
um it means the same thing to both of us
 
02:04:44.810 --> 02:04:44.820 align:start position:0%
and um we have a specific situation that
 
02:04:46.729 --> 02:04:46.739 align:start position:0%

you about why I think this is important
 
02:05:52.189 --> 02:05:52.199 align:start position:0%
and why I think this matters to the
 
02:05:53.510 --> 02:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and to local
 
02:05:54.890 --> 02:05:54.900 align:start position:0%
school districts
 
02:05:58.010 --> 02:05:58.020 align:start position:0%
so right now as Mr Alexander shared all
 
02:06:00.169 --> 02:06:00.179 align:start position:0%
School staff are required to complete a
 
02:06:02.750 --> 02:06:02.760 align:start position:0%
criminal records check that happens one
 
02:06:02.760 --> 02:06:03.950 align:start position:0%
criminal records check that happens one
time

02:06:03.950 --> 02:06:03.960 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:06:06.169 --> 02:06:06.179 align:start position:0%
there are no requirements to have any
 
02:06:08.570 --> 02:06:08.580 align:start position:0%
kind of an ongoing periodic check if
 
02:06:10.310 --> 02:06:10.320 align:start position:0%
local school districts want to negotiate
 
02:06:12.709 --> 02:06:12.719 align:start position:0%
that representative Miler asked about
 
02:06:15.169 --> 02:06:15.179 align:start position:0%
negotiations I would confirm that that
 
02:06:17.209 --> 02:06:17.219 align:start position:0%
means a collective bargaining agreement
 
02:06:19.609 --> 02:06:19.619 align:start position:0%
with a union specifically in Goffstown
 
02:06:21.410 --> 02:06:21.420 align:start position:0%
we have two unions we have a support
 
02:06:23.450 --> 02:06:23.460 align:start position:0%
staff Union and we have a teachers union
 
02:06:26.149 --> 02:06:26.159 align:start position:0%
they're both under Nea New Hampshire so
 
02:06:28.550 --> 02:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
as we have negotiated contracts over the
 
02:06:30.890 --> 02:06:30.900 align:start position:0%
many years one of the things that I have
 
02:06:33.229 --> 02:06:33.239 align:start position:0%
wanted to focus on is having a local
 
02:06:35.810 --> 02:06:35.820 align:start position:0%
policy and a local practice of having
 
02:06:37.729 --> 02:06:37.739 align:start position:0%
represented having everyone have a
 
02:06:38.870 --> 02:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
background checked with greater
 
02:06:40.970 --> 02:06:40.980 align:start position:0%
frequency every three years we have to
 
02:06:42.589 --> 02:06:42.599 align:start position:0%
recertify in this in the state of New
 
02:06:44.570 --> 02:06:44.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as certified Educators we have
 
02:06:46.370 --> 02:06:46.380 align:start position:0%
to submit evidence that we've continued
 
02:06:48.410 --> 02:06:48.420 align:start position:0%
to perform professional development and
 
02:06:50.510 --> 02:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
we've continued to hone our skills and
 
02:06:52.370 --> 02:06:52.380 align:start position:0%
that's all part of the process what I
 
02:06:54.470 --> 02:06:54.480 align:start position:0%
would like to do at the local level is
 
02:06:56.990 --> 02:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
negotiate terms in our Union contracts
 
02:06:58.250 --> 02:06:58.260 align:start position:0%
that would allow us to do criminal
 
02:07:00.410 --> 02:07:00.420 align:start position:0%
records checks on that same frequency
 
02:07:03.229 --> 02:07:03.239 align:start position:0%
right now the statute is silent does not
 
02:07:05.330 --> 02:07:05.340 align:start position:0%
allow us to do that and we're looking
 
02:07:07.790 --> 02:07:07.800 align:start position:0%
for enabling language that I can point
 
02:07:10.490 --> 02:07:10.500 align:start position:0%
to and say the statute specifically says
 
02:07:12.290 --> 02:07:12.300 align:start position:0%
local school districts can create
 
02:07:14.450 --> 02:07:14.460 align:start position:0%
different frequencies of criminal
 
02:07:16.490 --> 02:07:16.500 align:start position:0%
records checks based on their own local
 
02:07:18.589 --> 02:07:18.599 align:start position:0%
contracts we already have that in a
 
02:07:19.910 --> 02:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
school board policy through the
 
02:07:21.950 --> 02:07:21.960 align:start position:0%
Goffstown school board but we'd like to
 
02:07:24.709 --> 02:07:24.719 align:start position:0%
codify that in our negotiated contracts
 
02:07:26.810 --> 02:07:26.820 align:start position:0%
as well if I can and I'm happy to answer
 
02:07:28.370 --> 02:07:28.380 align:start position:0%
any questions as I go but I have some
 
02:07:30.770 --> 02:07:30.780 align:start position:0%
more information to share if I may so
 
02:07:33.530 --> 02:07:33.540 align:start position:0%
what I'd like to propose is I'd like to
 
02:07:35.209 --> 02:07:35.219 align:start position:0%
give a little bit of history on this so
 
02:07:37.669 --> 02:07:37.679 align:start position:0%
This statute was first enacted in 1993
 
02:07:40.850 --> 02:07:40.860 align:start position:0%
and in 2000 there were some pretty big
 
02:07:43.370 --> 02:07:43.380 align:start position:0%
changes that Restricted Section 5
 
02:07:46.370 --> 02:07:46.380 align:start position:0%
violations so specifically in 2000 that
 
02:07:48.290 --> 02:07:48.300 align:start position:0%
included murder child pornography
 
02:07:50.629 --> 02:07:50.639 align:start position:0%
aggravated felonious sexual assault
 
02:07:52.790 --> 02:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
felonious sexual assault and kidnapping
 
02:07:54.770 --> 02:07:54.780 align:start position:0%
those are the only things that we
 
02:07:57.530 --> 02:07:57.540 align:start position:0%
screened for beginning in 2000 so if you
 
02:07:59.930 --> 02:07:59.940 align:start position:0%
had any other convictions minor
 
02:08:02.270 --> 02:08:02.280 align:start position:0%
convictions or more significant
 
02:08:04.970 --> 02:08:04.980 align:start position:0%
convictions I would say arson should be
 
02:08:07.189 --> 02:08:07.199 align:start position:0%
on that list it's not so you could be
 
02:08:09.050 --> 02:08:09.060 align:start position:0%
convicted of arson and you could be a
 
02:08:10.370 --> 02:08:10.380 align:start position:0%
certified teacher in the state of New
 
02:08:12.530 --> 02:08:12.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and as a superintendent I
 
02:08:14.270 --> 02:08:14.280 align:start position:0%
potentially have no recourse no ability
 
02:08:16.430 --> 02:08:16.440 align:start position:0%
to check your background again
 
02:08:19.910 --> 02:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
so what we have is we have situations
 
02:08:23.750 --> 02:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
that in 1993 I still have 17 employees
 
02:08:26.089 --> 02:08:26.099 align:start position:0%
that are employed in SAU 19 and the
 
02:08:27.410 --> 02:08:27.420 align:start position:0%
communities of Goffstown and New Boston
 
02:08:29.629 --> 02:08:29.639 align:start position:0%
that were never given a criminal records
 
02:08:31.609 --> 02:08:31.619 align:start position:0%
check at any point in time they were
 
02:08:33.770 --> 02:08:33.780 align:start position:0%
hired prior to the statute even being
 
02:08:33.780 --> 02:08:35.209 align:start position:0%
hired prior to the statute even being
enacted

02:08:35.209 --> 02:08:35.219 align:start position:0%
enacted
 
02:08:39.169 --> 02:08:39.179 align:start position:0%
so pre-2000 I have 47 employees that
 
02:08:42.470 --> 02:08:42.480 align:start position:0%
were hired before before uh 2000. I have
 
02:08:44.030 --> 02:08:44.040 align:start position:0%
no idea if they have any convictions
 
02:08:46.129 --> 02:08:46.139 align:start position:0%
Beyond those five felonies that we
 
02:08:50.570 --> 02:08:50.580 align:start position:0%
listed and in 2017 the statute changed
 
02:08:52.669 --> 02:08:52.679 align:start position:0%
that went through this committee and
 
02:08:54.830 --> 02:08:54.840 align:start position:0%
what superintendents now receive is a
 
02:08:56.570 --> 02:08:56.580 align:start position:0%
more comprehensive background check it
 
02:08:58.010 --> 02:08:58.020 align:start position:0%
includes arrests it includes
 
02:09:00.350 --> 02:09:00.360 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors and that allows us at the
 
02:09:02.510 --> 02:09:02.520 align:start position:0%
local decision to evaluate child safety
 
02:09:04.310 --> 02:09:04.320 align:start position:0%
and make decisions at the local level
 
02:09:06.950 --> 02:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
this is not a gotcha this is not I'm out
 
02:09:10.430 --> 02:09:10.440 align:start position:0%
to to catch people who have a unsavory
 
02:09:12.109 --> 02:09:12.119 align:start position:0%
things in their past this is about
 
02:09:15.410 --> 02:09:15.420 align:start position:0%
making sure that children are safe and
 
02:09:17.330 --> 02:09:17.340 align:start position:0%
in Goffstown if we want to negotiate
 
02:09:19.070 --> 02:09:19.080 align:start position:0%
terms that we're going to do criminal
 
02:09:21.530 --> 02:09:21.540 align:start position:0%
records checks every three years we need
 
02:09:23.209 --> 02:09:23.219 align:start position:0%
a statute that allows us to do that
 
02:09:25.070 --> 02:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
that's why this was brought before you
 
02:09:28.330 --> 02:09:28.340 align:start position:0%
so the other thing I would share in 2018
 
02:09:30.830 --> 02:09:30.840 align:start position:0%
the code of ethics and code of conduct
 
02:09:32.570 --> 02:09:32.580 align:start position:0%
was put into place you're probably all
 
02:09:36.410 --> 02:09:36.420 align:start position:0%
familiar with this and if you look at
 
02:09:40.070 --> 02:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
page 11. page 11 says that
 
02:09:43.129 --> 02:09:43.139 align:start position:0%
unprofessional conduct shall include and
 
02:09:45.950 --> 02:09:45.960 align:start position:0%
it says failure to self-report within
 
02:09:48.830 --> 02:09:48.840 align:start position:0%
five business days if he or she meaning
 
02:09:51.530 --> 02:09:51.540 align:start position:0%
a teacher a credentialed educator has
 
02:09:54.050 --> 02:09:54.060 align:start position:0%
been arrested for any violations of
 
02:09:58.070 --> 02:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
offenses enumerated in RSA 189 13a5
 
02:10:00.169 --> 02:10:00.179 align:start position:0%
which are those list of felonies the
 
02:10:02.689 --> 02:10:02.699 align:start position:0%
list was expanded and it now includes
 
02:10:06.109 --> 02:10:06.119 align:start position:0%
things like prostitution endangering the
 
02:10:08.510 --> 02:10:08.520 align:start position:0%
welfare of a child in decent exposure
 
02:10:10.810 --> 02:10:10.820 align:start position:0%
lewdness possession of child sex images
 
02:10:12.850 --> 02:10:12.860 align:start position:0%
distribution of child sex images
 
02:10:15.709 --> 02:10:15.719 align:start position:0%
manufacturing of child sex images use of
 
02:10:18.290 --> 02:10:18.300 align:start position:0%
computers for child sex images obscene
 
02:10:20.270 --> 02:10:20.280 align:start position:0%
matters and material capital murder
 
02:10:22.270 --> 02:10:22.280 align:start position:0%
first degree murder second degree murder
 
02:10:24.830 --> 02:10:24.840 align:start position:0%
manslaughter aggravated felonia sexual
 
02:10:27.050 --> 02:10:27.060 align:start position:0%
assault felonious sexual assault sexual
 
02:10:29.689 --> 02:10:29.699 align:start position:0%
assault kidnapping human trafficking and
 
02:10:33.050 --> 02:10:33.060 align:start position:0%
incest anything else that anyone would
 
02:10:36.109 --> 02:10:36.119 align:start position:0%
be arrested for or convicted for they
 
02:10:39.229 --> 02:10:39.239 align:start position:0%
have no obligation to even tell me as
 
02:10:41.570 --> 02:10:41.580 align:start position:0%
the employer according to the code of
 
02:10:41.580 --> 02:10:42.410 align:start position:0%
the employer according to the code of
ethics

02:10:42.410 --> 02:10:42.420 align:start position:0%
ethics
 
02:10:44.750 --> 02:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
now I think this document is wrong but
 
02:10:47.089 --> 02:10:47.099 align:start position:0%
this isn't my purview so what I want to
 
02:10:49.490 --> 02:10:49.500 align:start position:0%
do is negotiate terms at the local level
 
02:10:52.250 --> 02:10:52.260 align:start position:0%
this is fully supported by our school
 
02:10:54.470 --> 02:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
board in Goffstown to be able to have
 
02:10:56.870 --> 02:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
language in the statute that would allow
 
02:11:01.070 --> 02:11:01.080 align:start position:0%
us to negotiate these terms as we said I
 
02:11:03.169 --> 02:11:03.179 align:start position:0%
would say that unfortunately there seems
 
02:11:05.030 --> 02:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
to be an uptick in the number of
 
02:11:06.770 --> 02:11:06.780 align:start position:0%
Educators who are engaging in
 
02:11:10.189 --> 02:11:10.199 align:start position:0%
inappropriate behavior and I would share
 
02:11:11.810 --> 02:11:11.820 align:start position:0%
that on the New Hampshire New Hampshire
 
02:11:14.089 --> 02:11:14.099 align:start position:0%
education department website there's a
 
02:11:15.830 --> 02:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
technical advisory and press releases
 
02:11:17.510 --> 02:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
that indicate the number of educator
 
02:11:19.790 --> 02:11:19.800 align:start position:0%
misconduct investigations are increasing
 
02:11:23.030 --> 02:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
the department reported in 2014 there
 
02:11:25.790 --> 02:11:25.800 align:start position:0%
are 170 investigations and the last
 
02:11:28.010 --> 02:11:28.020 align:start position:0%
number they shared was 2018 with well
 
02:11:29.870 --> 02:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
over 200 I don't know what that number
 
02:11:32.750 --> 02:11:32.760 align:start position:0%
is now attorney Fenton is here from the
 
02:11:34.250 --> 02:11:34.260 align:start position:0%
Department she could probably speak to
 
02:11:36.589 --> 02:11:36.599 align:start position:0%
that there's a list right now of over
 
02:11:38.750 --> 02:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
200 Educators in the state of New
 
02:11:40.729 --> 02:11:40.739 align:start position:0%
Hampshire who have had their license to
 
02:11:42.830 --> 02:11:42.840 align:start position:0%
teach suspended or revoked
 
02:11:42.840 --> 02:11:45.410 align:start position:0%
teach suspended or revoked
200.

02:11:45.410 --> 02:11:45.420 align:start position:0%
200.
 
02:11:47.390 --> 02:11:47.400 align:start position:0%
who knows what they
 
02:11:49.790 --> 02:11:49.800 align:start position:0%
were background checked on or when
 
02:11:52.550 --> 02:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
so again we're looking to have local
 
02:11:55.129 --> 02:11:55.139 align:start position:0%
terms that we can negotiate I will share
 
02:11:57.290 --> 02:11:57.300 align:start position:0%
I've had two examples that the committee
 
02:11:59.030 --> 02:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
might be interested in we had a long
 
02:12:01.430 --> 02:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
time teacher that worked for us this
 
02:12:03.169 --> 02:12:03.179 align:start position:0%
individual left the profession of
 
02:12:05.750 --> 02:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
education at a later point in time chose
 
02:12:07.910 --> 02:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
to go back into teaching I get a call
 
02:12:09.709 --> 02:12:09.719 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Ed that there was
 
02:12:11.870 --> 02:12:11.880 align:start position:0%
a question about their background
 
02:12:13.790 --> 02:12:13.800 align:start position:0%
another school district went to hire
 
02:12:16.970 --> 02:12:16.980 align:start position:0%
this individual and did not because of
 
02:12:19.070 --> 02:12:19.080 align:start position:0%
their background I have no idea what it
 
02:12:20.510 --> 02:12:20.520 align:start position:0%
was I have no idea what their
 
02:12:22.310 --> 02:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
convictions were I have no idea what
 
02:12:24.649 --> 02:12:24.659 align:start position:0%
they found in that background all I know
 
02:12:26.689 --> 02:12:26.699 align:start position:0%
is as a sitting teacher in my school
 
02:12:29.030 --> 02:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
district I didn't have that information
 
02:12:31.729 --> 02:12:31.739 align:start position:0%
and that was important to me so at the
 
02:12:33.890 --> 02:12:33.900 align:start position:0%
end of the day this is fundamentally all
 
02:12:36.229 --> 02:12:36.239 align:start position:0%
about local control and making sure that
 
02:12:37.790 --> 02:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
we're doing everything in our due
 
02:12:40.189 --> 02:12:40.199 align:start position:0%
diligence to make sure kids are safe and
 
02:12:41.689 --> 02:12:41.699 align:start position:0%
respectfully I would ask you to support
 
02:12:43.970 --> 02:12:43.980 align:start position:0%
this proposed Bill and I'm happy to
 
02:12:45.470 --> 02:12:45.480 align:start position:0%
answer any questions thank you are there
 
02:12:46.629 --> 02:12:46.639 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
02:12:49.430 --> 02:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli uh thank you
 
02:12:51.950 --> 02:12:51.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here and um and
 
02:12:54.290 --> 02:12:54.300 align:start position:0%
testifying on this uh and I'm not sure
 
02:12:56.330 --> 02:12:56.340 align:start position:0%
if I heard you correctly but it seemed
 
02:12:58.609 --> 02:12:58.619 align:start position:0%
like you were indicating that you wanted
 
02:13:00.010 --> 02:13:00.020 align:start position:0%
to be able to
 
02:13:02.390 --> 02:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
include in your contract negotiations
 
02:13:05.629 --> 02:13:05.639 align:start position:0%
scheduled correct background checks but
 
02:13:08.169 --> 02:13:08.179 align:start position:0%
also possibly
 
02:13:11.209 --> 02:13:11.219 align:start position:0%
additional offenses that you might be
 
02:13:14.209 --> 02:13:14.219 align:start position:0%
looking for beyond the section five
 
02:13:16.970 --> 02:13:16.980 align:start position:0%
offenses did I hear you correctly or
 
02:13:19.729 --> 02:13:19.739 align:start position:0%
misunderstand correct
 
02:13:23.629 --> 02:13:23.639 align:start position:0%
to follow up yes so so you want to be
 
02:13:25.490 --> 02:13:25.500 align:start position:0%
able to negotiate
 
02:13:27.649 --> 02:13:27.659 align:start position:0%
um would you put that into a contract
 
02:13:30.169 --> 02:13:30.179 align:start position:0%
negotiations what offenses you would be
 
02:13:32.689 --> 02:13:32.699 align:start position:0%
looking for as part of the criminal
 
02:13:34.729 --> 02:13:34.739 align:start position:0%
records check or would just be the
 
02:13:34.739 --> 02:13:35.930 align:start position:0%
records check or would just be the
schedule

02:13:35.930 --> 02:13:35.940 align:start position:0%
schedule
 
02:13:37.550 --> 02:13:37.560 align:start position:0%
um I would imagine again that would be
 
02:13:40.010 --> 02:13:40.020 align:start position:0%
part of the negotiations with our um
 
02:13:42.109 --> 02:13:42.119 align:start position:0%
with our unions but I would think it
 
02:13:44.510 --> 02:13:44.520 align:start position:0%
would be the frequency cycle that the
 
02:13:46.069 --> 02:13:46.079 align:start position:0%
background checks would be done and then
 
02:13:47.689 --> 02:13:47.699 align:start position:0%
probably some logistical parameters
 
02:13:50.689 --> 02:13:50.699 align:start position:0%
around once that the first batch has
 
02:13:53.569 --> 02:13:53.579 align:start position:0%
been rechecked that then a future
 
02:13:55.250 --> 02:13:55.260 align:start position:0%
superintendent wouldn't have the ability
 
02:13:57.050 --> 02:13:57.060 align:start position:0%
to come back and
 
02:13:58.750 --> 02:13:58.760 align:start position:0%
um basically
 
02:14:00.589 --> 02:14:00.599 align:start position:0%
reconsider something that had already
 
02:14:02.089 --> 02:14:02.099 align:start position:0%
been accepted and approved by the
 
02:14:04.010 --> 02:14:04.020 align:start position:0%
sitting superintendent so that's the
 
02:14:05.450 --> 02:14:05.460 align:start position:0%
kind of language that I think we would
 
02:14:07.729 --> 02:14:07.739 align:start position:0%
negotiate the statute also specifically
 
02:14:10.010 --> 02:14:10.020 align:start position:0%
says at the local level school boards
 
02:14:11.930 --> 02:14:11.940 align:start position:0%
can develop their own local policies
 
02:14:14.510 --> 02:14:14.520 align:start position:0%
that include the types of offenses
 
02:14:16.490 --> 02:14:16.500 align:start position:0%
including misdemeanors or other things
 
02:14:18.470 --> 02:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
that might be restricted for employment
 
02:14:20.270 --> 02:14:20.280 align:start position:0%
but I want to be clear with committee
 
02:14:22.010 --> 02:14:22.020 align:start position:0%
this is not about me finding people
 
02:14:23.870 --> 02:14:23.880 align:start position:0%
who've done bad things this is just
 
02:14:25.310 --> 02:14:25.320 align:start position:0%
about making sure that we're keeping
 
02:14:28.310 --> 02:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
kids as safe as we can and it's
 
02:14:30.709 --> 02:14:30.719 align:start position:0%
surprising to me that Educators don't
 
02:14:32.930 --> 02:14:32.940 align:start position:0%
already have to do this I think if you
 
02:14:34.850 --> 02:14:34.860 align:start position:0%
ask most parents do you think your kid's
 
02:14:37.010 --> 02:14:37.020 align:start position:0%
teacher gets a background check every
 
02:14:38.390 --> 02:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
once in a while I think most people
 
02:14:41.390 --> 02:14:41.400 align:start position:0%
would say well they must right
 
02:14:42.950 --> 02:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
how often do doctors get background
 
02:14:42.960 --> 02:14:44.209 align:start position:0%
how often do doctors get background
checks

02:14:44.209 --> 02:14:44.219 align:start position:0%
checks
 
02:14:45.770 --> 02:14:45.780 align:start position:0%
do they get done once and then never
 
02:14:45.780 --> 02:14:46.790 align:start position:0%
do they get done once and then never
again

02:14:46.790 --> 02:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
again
 
02:14:49.609 --> 02:14:49.619 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:52.069 --> 02:14:52.079 align:start position:0%
further questions represent miler
 
02:14:54.350 --> 02:14:54.360 align:start position:0%
and thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
02:14:55.490 --> 02:14:55.500 align:start position:0%
being here and bringing this to our
 
02:14:55.500 --> 02:14:56.990 align:start position:0%
being here and bringing this to our
attention

02:14:56.990 --> 02:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
attention
 
02:14:59.689 --> 02:14:59.699 align:start position:0%
there's no question I'm sure that every
 
02:15:00.950 --> 02:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
member of this committee wants to make
 
02:15:03.050 --> 02:15:03.060 align:start position:0%
sure that we have teachers that are safe
 
02:15:06.530 --> 02:15:06.540 align:start position:0%
and meet the the appropriate uh behavior
 
02:15:09.229 --> 02:15:09.239 align:start position:0%
that for them to work with kids I've got
 
02:15:11.750 --> 02:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
a couple questions for you though
 
02:15:13.970 --> 02:15:13.980 align:start position:0%
um isn't there currently in a collective
 
02:15:16.729 --> 02:15:16.739 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreement uh grounds for
 
02:15:16.739 --> 02:15:17.990 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreement uh grounds for
dismissal

02:15:17.990 --> 02:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
dismissal
 
02:15:20.089 --> 02:15:20.099 align:start position:0%
uh that would be covered in a background
 
02:15:21.770 --> 02:15:21.780 align:start position:0%
check for example that's the first
 
02:15:21.780 --> 02:15:23.089 align:start position:0%
check for example that's the first
question

02:15:23.089 --> 02:15:23.099 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:15:25.310 --> 02:15:25.320 align:start position:0%
um I might defer to attorney Fenton on
 
02:15:26.870 --> 02:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
that I would say not that I'm aware of
 
02:15:30.050 --> 02:15:30.060 align:start position:0%
so in our in our negotiated Union
 
02:15:31.790 --> 02:15:31.800 align:start position:0%
contracts there are Provisions that
 
02:15:33.649 --> 02:15:33.659 align:start position:0%
allow us to dismiss a teacher but it's
 
02:15:36.350 --> 02:15:36.360 align:start position:0%
basically predicated on three tenants in
 
02:15:38.930 --> 02:15:38.940 align:start position:0%
subordination incompetence or immorality
 
02:15:41.750 --> 02:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
arguably the immorality piece you could
 
02:15:43.910 --> 02:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
consider but if we don't have any
 
02:15:46.250 --> 02:15:46.260 align:start position:0%
knowledge that someone has been arrested
 
02:15:48.589 --> 02:15:48.599 align:start position:0%
or convicted of a crime we wouldn't have
 
02:15:51.109 --> 02:15:51.119 align:start position:0%
any ability to even have that
 
02:15:53.770 --> 02:15:53.780 align:start position:0%
information to pursue a potential
 
02:15:55.850 --> 02:15:55.860 align:start position:0%
disciplinary measure with an employee
 
02:15:59.629 --> 02:15:59.639 align:start position:0%
thank you second question is what's the
 
02:16:02.330 --> 02:16:02.340 align:start position:0%
current charge for a background check I
 
02:16:05.689 --> 02:16:05.699 align:start position:0%
think it's thirty dollars and what we I
 
02:16:07.609 --> 02:16:07.619 align:start position:0%
think representative Alexander said that
 
02:16:08.689 --> 02:16:08.699 align:start position:0%
he thinks that would be part of the
 
02:16:10.550 --> 02:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
negotiation I would agree I can tell you
 
02:16:13.729 --> 02:16:13.739 align:start position:0%
that we already included money in our
 
02:16:15.950 --> 02:16:15.960 align:start position:0%
budget to do the increased number of
 
02:16:18.770 --> 02:16:18.780 align:start position:0%
background checks but volunteers per
 
02:16:21.050 --> 02:16:21.060 align:start position:0%
statute are supposed to pay themselves
 
02:16:23.030 --> 02:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
and then local school districts can have
 
02:16:25.069 --> 02:16:25.079 align:start position:0%
a policy that reimburses them if they
 
02:16:26.510 --> 02:16:26.520 align:start position:0%
decide to so in your school district
 
02:16:28.790 --> 02:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
you're in the follow-up questions your
 
02:16:30.890 --> 02:16:30.900 align:start position:0%
your intent then uh would be to pay for
 
02:16:33.110 --> 02:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
them yes yes thank you very much yes
 
02:16:35.030 --> 02:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
thank you I have a question for you uh
 
02:16:35.870 --> 02:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
have you talked with other
 
02:16:37.429 --> 02:16:37.439 align:start position:0%
administrators in other districts
 
02:16:39.950 --> 02:16:39.960 align:start position:0%
whether they're seeing a similar concern
 
02:16:42.709 --> 02:16:42.719 align:start position:0%
as as you or talk with I see Jerry fruit
 
02:16:45.290 --> 02:16:45.300 align:start position:0%
hiding behind Brian back there
 
02:16:45.300 --> 02:16:46.129 align:start position:0%
hiding behind Brian back there
um

02:16:46.129 --> 02:16:46.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:46.139 --> 02:16:47.570 align:start position:0%
um
um

02:16:47.570 --> 02:16:47.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:50.209 --> 02:16:50.219 align:start position:0%
I I have in fact spoken with Jerry frew
 
02:16:52.190 --> 02:16:52.200 align:start position:0%
I've spoken with other superintendents I
 
02:16:53.750 --> 02:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
think this is an example of something of
 
02:16:56.150 --> 02:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
I don't know why I'm the only one here
 
02:16:58.190 --> 02:16:58.200 align:start position:0%
wanting to fix this this seems to me
 
02:16:59.450 --> 02:16:59.460 align:start position:0%
this should be something that everyone
 
02:17:01.610 --> 02:17:01.620 align:start position:0%
who works in public education should
 
02:17:03.469 --> 02:17:03.479 align:start position:0%
know about and care about you're not
 
02:17:05.870 --> 02:17:05.880 align:start position:0%
compelling anyone to do anything you're
 
02:17:08.509 --> 02:17:08.519 align:start position:0%
just allowing local school districts to
 
02:17:10.849 --> 02:17:10.859 align:start position:0%
negotiate terms I can tell you that in
 
02:17:12.530 --> 02:17:12.540 align:start position:0%
those negotiations
 
02:17:14.810 --> 02:17:14.820 align:start position:0%
um with Nea and I'm not speaking ill of
 
02:17:17.509 --> 02:17:17.519 align:start position:0%
Nea in any way but when I've brought up
 
02:17:19.669 --> 02:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
criminal record checks in an increased
 
02:17:21.950 --> 02:17:21.960 align:start position:0%
frequency I have been met with there is
 
02:17:24.049 --> 02:17:24.059 align:start position:0%
nothing in the statute that allows you
 
02:17:25.549 --> 02:17:25.559 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
02:17:28.910 --> 02:17:28.920 align:start position:0%
which arguably is true
 
02:17:31.490 --> 02:17:31.500 align:start position:0%
further questions yes representative Dan
 
02:17:31.500 --> 02:17:32.629 align:start position:0%
further questions yes representative Dan
Damon

02:17:32.629 --> 02:17:32.639 align:start position:0%
Damon
 
02:17:34.310 --> 02:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
02:17:35.570 --> 02:17:35.580 align:start position:0%
my question
 
02:17:37.250 --> 02:17:37.260 align:start position:0%
so you indicated that the Goffstown
 
02:17:39.889 --> 02:17:39.899 align:start position:0%
school board has a policy to do this
 
02:17:39.899 --> 02:17:41.209 align:start position:0%
school board has a policy to do this
correct

02:17:41.209 --> 02:17:41.219 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:17:44.030 --> 02:17:44.040 align:start position:0%
and I understand that the law there
 
02:17:46.190 --> 02:17:46.200 align:start position:0%
isn't a law
 
02:17:48.830 --> 02:17:48.840 align:start position:0%
that says you may do this but is there a
 
02:17:50.509 --> 02:17:50.519 align:start position:0%
law that says you can't
 
02:17:52.310 --> 02:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
there is not a law that says you can't
 
02:17:55.129 --> 02:17:55.139 align:start position:0%
and specifically I would
 
02:17:57.290 --> 02:17:57.300 align:start position:0%
um show you it's Goffstown School Board
 
02:18:01.150 --> 02:18:01.160 align:start position:0%
policy g b c d and
 
02:18:05.270 --> 02:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
gbcd-r which is the regulation so we do
 
02:18:07.310 --> 02:18:07.320 align:start position:0%
have language that allows us to do the
 
02:18:08.570 --> 02:18:08.580 align:start position:0%
criminal record check with greater
 
02:18:11.209 --> 02:18:11.219 align:start position:0%
frequency however there's nothing
 
02:18:13.610 --> 02:18:13.620 align:start position:0%
um nothing that would allow me to do
 
02:18:16.549 --> 02:18:16.559 align:start position:0%
that in our contract so even though it
 
02:18:19.849 --> 02:18:19.859 align:start position:0%
says it in policy it would be considered
 
02:18:21.709 --> 02:18:21.719 align:start position:0%
a change in working conditions it would
 
02:18:24.889 --> 02:18:24.899 align:start position:0%
be grieved and I would lose any kind of
 
02:18:27.889 --> 02:18:27.899 align:start position:0%
a grievance Appeal on that topic so just
 
02:18:31.849 --> 02:18:31.859 align:start position:0%
having it in stat in your policy is not
 
02:18:31.859 --> 02:18:32.750 align:start position:0%
having it in stat in your policy is not
enough

02:18:32.750 --> 02:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
enough
 
02:18:34.009 --> 02:18:34.019 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions
 
02:18:35.810 --> 02:18:35.820 align:start position:0%
representative Hall
 
02:18:37.490 --> 02:18:37.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
02:18:38.990 --> 02:18:39.000 align:start position:0%
my location
 
02:18:40.849 --> 02:18:40.859 align:start position:0%
um I just want to be clear on the intent
 
02:18:43.730 --> 02:18:43.740 align:start position:0%
of the bill is the intent to be able to
 
02:18:46.969 --> 02:18:46.979 align:start position:0%
do the background checks or the intent
 
02:18:48.950 --> 02:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
truly to be able to negotiate that it's
 
02:18:52.129 --> 02:18:52.139 align:start position:0%
to negotiate so the the language that um
 
02:18:53.870 --> 02:18:53.880 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander submitted in
 
02:18:56.270 --> 02:18:56.280 align:start position:0%
the LSR is exclusively allowing the
 
02:18:58.129 --> 02:18:58.139 align:start position:0%
ability to negotiate at the local level
 
02:19:00.530 --> 02:19:00.540 align:start position:0%
I think the majority of our school
 
02:19:02.690 --> 02:19:02.700 align:start position:0%
districts all have Union contracts so
 
02:19:04.129 --> 02:19:04.139 align:start position:0%
every school district would have to
 
02:19:06.169 --> 02:19:06.179 align:start position:0%
negotiate specific terms with their
 
02:19:08.389 --> 02:19:08.399 align:start position:0%
unions as part of their agreement I just
 
02:19:10.310 --> 02:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
want the ability to do that this is
 
02:19:11.990 --> 02:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
important to me it's important to my
 
02:19:14.690 --> 02:19:14.700 align:start position:0%
school board we think teachers and
 
02:19:16.610 --> 02:19:16.620 align:start position:0%
anyone working with kids should have
 
02:19:18.490 --> 02:19:18.500 align:start position:0%
background checks on a reoccurring
 
02:19:21.169 --> 02:19:21.179 align:start position:0%
systematic predictable basis you're
 
02:19:23.030 --> 02:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
going to work with kids this is part of
 
02:19:25.790 --> 02:19:25.800 align:start position:0%
it we need to make sure I want to say
 
02:19:27.650 --> 02:19:27.660 align:start position:0%
that I believe my employees haven't done
 
02:19:29.150 --> 02:19:29.160 align:start position:0%
anything that I would have issue with
 
02:19:31.610 --> 02:19:31.620 align:start position:0%
but I would say as Ronald Reagan said
 
02:19:42.410 --> 02:19:42.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:44.810 --> 02:19:44.820 align:start position:0%
um you all you also mentioned
 
02:19:46.429 --> 02:19:46.439 align:start position:0%
thank you by the way for taking my
 
02:19:49.190 --> 02:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
question but you also mentioned
 
02:19:50.929 --> 02:19:50.939 align:start position:0%
um what you wanted the background check
 
02:19:55.070 --> 02:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
of and my understanding in many years
 
02:19:58.190 --> 02:19:58.200 align:start position:0%
talking with the Department of Safety
 
02:20:00.110 --> 02:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
is that they can all they are only
 
02:20:02.510 --> 02:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
checking for the education department
 
02:20:05.630 --> 02:20:05.640 align:start position:0%
those things in the list which as you
 
02:20:08.870 --> 02:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
said we expanded a number of times
 
02:20:12.590 --> 02:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
um you know from the original five
 
02:20:12.600 --> 02:20:14.210 align:start position:0%
um you know from the original five
um

02:20:14.210 --> 02:20:14.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:17.929 --> 02:20:17.939 align:start position:0%
how would that work with the Department
 
02:20:19.490 --> 02:20:19.500 align:start position:0%
of Safety was doing the background
 
02:20:22.670 --> 02:20:22.680 align:start position:0%
checks if they are if currently we've
 
02:20:24.530 --> 02:20:24.540 align:start position:0%
said in Statue these are the things
 
02:20:26.750 --> 02:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
we're checking on and these are the
 
02:20:28.550 --> 02:20:28.560 align:start position:0%
things that they check on because that's
 
02:20:32.090 --> 02:20:32.100 align:start position:0%
what's in Statue statute and I don't see
 
02:20:34.490 --> 02:20:34.500 align:start position:0%
that in this bill at all sure So
 
02:20:37.429 --> 02:20:37.439 align:start position:0%
currently right now uh we don't just
 
02:20:39.889 --> 02:20:39.899 align:start position:0%
check the section 5 violations right now
 
02:20:42.290 --> 02:20:42.300 align:start position:0%
current superintendents for any employee
 
02:20:44.809 --> 02:20:44.819 align:start position:0%
any volunteer who gets a background
 
02:20:47.450 --> 02:20:47.460 align:start position:0%
check we get their entire
 
02:20:50.690 --> 02:20:50.700 align:start position:0%
um history so we get any arrests any
 
02:20:53.450 --> 02:20:53.460 align:start position:0%
convictions any Court proceedings and
 
02:20:55.070 --> 02:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
that includes misdemeanors as well as
 
02:20:57.889 --> 02:20:57.899 align:start position:0%
the section five felony violations so I
 
02:20:59.570 --> 02:20:59.580 align:start position:0%
don't see that it would be a change in
 
02:21:01.730 --> 02:21:01.740 align:start position:0%
practice for the State Police or their
 
02:21:04.010 --> 02:21:04.020 align:start position:0%
Partners at the FBI it would however
 
02:21:06.410 --> 02:21:06.420 align:start position:0%
likely be an increased volume so I would
 
02:21:08.690 --> 02:21:08.700 align:start position:0%
certainly acknowledge that for the State
 
02:21:10.610 --> 02:21:10.620 align:start position:0%
Police there could be an increase in
 
02:21:13.550 --> 02:21:13.560 align:start position:0%
volume but I would say
 
02:21:16.490 --> 02:21:16.500 align:start position:0%
good this is keeping Kids Safe
 
02:21:19.370 --> 02:21:19.380 align:start position:0%
thank you represent cascadden
 
02:21:21.530 --> 02:21:21.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you Brian
 
02:21:24.110 --> 02:21:24.120 align:start position:0%
for bringing this forward I'm looking at
 
02:21:26.330 --> 02:21:26.340 align:start position:0%
just the the language of the Bell it's
 
02:21:28.130 --> 02:21:28.140 align:start position:0%
as relative to criminal records uh
 
02:21:30.410 --> 02:21:30.420 align:start position:0%
record checks in school employment and I
 
02:21:32.150 --> 02:21:32.160 align:start position:0%
just question if you I don't know if you
 
02:21:33.469 --> 02:21:33.479 align:start position:0%
can answer this but when I look at
 
02:21:35.990 --> 02:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
school employment are we talking only
 
02:21:38.270 --> 02:21:38.280 align:start position:0%
about the current employees are we
 
02:21:41.809 --> 02:21:41.819 align:start position:0%
talking about the teachers or who are in
 
02:21:43.730 --> 02:21:43.740 align:start position:0%
a school employment of a private school
 
02:21:46.670 --> 02:21:46.680 align:start position:0%
or a non-public school so yeah this
 
02:21:49.849 --> 02:21:49.859 align:start position:0%
would include any employees designated
 
02:21:52.790 --> 02:21:52.800 align:start position:0%
volunteers or any contracted services so
 
02:21:55.910 --> 02:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
for example you've likely heard that for
 
02:21:57.710 --> 02:21:57.720 align:start position:0%
many of the positions that we have needs
 
02:21:59.150 --> 02:21:59.160 align:start position:0%
for like speech and language
 
02:22:01.490 --> 02:22:01.500 align:start position:0%
Pathologists as an example many of us
 
02:22:03.230 --> 02:22:03.240 align:start position:0%
are not able to hire those folks as
 
02:22:05.210 --> 02:22:05.220 align:start position:0%
employees and we have contracted service
 
02:22:08.210 --> 02:22:08.220 align:start position:0%
agreements only when we can't find
 
02:22:11.030 --> 02:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
people and those individuals would also
 
02:22:12.530 --> 02:22:12.540 align:start position:0%
be subject to the criminal records
 
02:22:15.650 --> 02:22:15.660 align:start position:0%
checks just a follow-up yes
 
02:22:17.750 --> 02:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
um so I just wonder then
 
02:22:20.150 --> 02:22:20.160 align:start position:0%
um education Freedom account has a list
 
02:22:22.490 --> 02:22:22.500 align:start position:0%
of service providers and wondering if
 
02:22:24.349 --> 02:22:24.359 align:start position:0%
this would apply to all those service
 
02:22:24.359 --> 02:22:25.849 align:start position:0%
this would apply to all those service
providers

02:22:25.849 --> 02:22:25.859 align:start position:0%
providers
 
02:22:28.370 --> 02:22:28.380 align:start position:0%
under the education Freedom accounts as
 
02:22:30.650 --> 02:22:30.660 align:start position:0%
well as the retailers that are service
 
02:22:33.710 --> 02:22:33.720 align:start position:0%
providers I don't believe that there
 
02:22:35.630 --> 02:22:35.640 align:start position:0%
would be any applicability for that I
 
02:22:37.250 --> 02:22:37.260 align:start position:0%
might defer to the department if
 
02:22:38.870 --> 02:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
attorney Fenton thinks that might be the
 
02:22:41.090 --> 02:22:41.100 align:start position:0%
case but essentially this would just
 
02:22:46.070 --> 02:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
allow us so any employee that would be
 
02:22:47.690 --> 02:22:47.700 align:start position:0%
covered under the criminal records check
 
02:22:50.270 --> 02:22:50.280 align:start position:0%
I would need to negotiate the terms with
 
02:22:52.429 --> 02:22:52.439 align:start position:0%
our partners at Nea to have language
 
02:22:54.050 --> 02:22:54.060 align:start position:0%
that would be acceptable to both of us
 
02:22:55.910 --> 02:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
to do those criminal records checks if
 
02:22:57.410 --> 02:22:57.420 align:start position:0%
someone is not covered by a collective
 
02:22:59.510 --> 02:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreement then we would have
 
02:23:02.450 --> 02:23:02.460 align:start position:0%
the ability to require that increased
 
02:23:04.550 --> 02:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
frequency and by the way I would share
 
02:23:07.150 --> 02:23:07.160 align:start position:0%
this would include any credentialed
 
02:23:07.160 --> 02:23:09.130 align:start position:0%
this would include any credentialed
licensed

02:23:09.130 --> 02:23:09.140 align:start position:0%
licensed
 
02:23:11.510 --> 02:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
teacher educator including the
 
02:23:11.520 --> 02:23:12.950 align:start position:0%
teacher educator including the
superintendent

02:23:12.950 --> 02:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
superintendent
 
02:23:15.250 --> 02:23:15.260 align:start position:0%
my community should know that I haven't
 
02:23:17.870 --> 02:23:17.880 align:start position:0%
had anything in my criminal background
 
02:23:19.790 --> 02:23:19.800 align:start position:0%
that they should be aware of I've been
 
02:23:23.030 --> 02:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
there 15 years I'm I predate some of
 
02:23:24.650 --> 02:23:24.660 align:start position:0%
these statutes they have not done a
 
02:23:28.130 --> 02:23:28.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:31.429 --> 02:23:31.439 align:start position:0%
thank you representative woodcock
 
02:23:33.410 --> 02:23:33.420 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman I appreciate it good
 
02:23:35.750 --> 02:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
morning super time good to see you a
 
02:23:38.990 --> 02:23:39.000 align:start position:0%
couple questions is the um Secondary
 
02:23:40.309 --> 02:23:40.319 align:start position:0%
School administrators Association
 
02:23:42.170 --> 02:23:42.180 align:start position:0%
supporting this
 
02:23:43.370 --> 02:23:43.380 align:start position:0%
um the New Hampshire School
 
02:23:44.990 --> 02:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
administratives Association I believe
 
02:23:46.790 --> 02:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
signed the clipboard that they were in
 
02:23:49.370 --> 02:23:49.380 align:start position:0%
support of this and doe
 
02:23:50.630 --> 02:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
um I don't want to speak for the
 
02:23:52.550 --> 02:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
Department attorney Fenton is here I
 
02:23:54.830 --> 02:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
don't know if she has the ability to
 
02:23:56.270 --> 02:23:56.280 align:start position:0%
answer that on behalf of the department
 
02:23:58.670 --> 02:23:58.680 align:start position:0%
I have however I will share with the
 
02:24:00.770 --> 02:24:00.780 align:start position:0%
committee I've spoken with Diana Diana
 
02:24:02.510 --> 02:24:02.520 align:start position:0%
and I have worked on this
 
02:24:03.830 --> 02:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
um I've been talking to her about this
 
02:24:05.809 --> 02:24:05.819 align:start position:0%
for a number of years and we were
 
02:24:07.910 --> 02:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
finally able to work with representative
 
02:24:10.070 --> 02:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
Alexander to bring this before you and
 
02:24:11.950 --> 02:24:11.960 align:start position:0%
the final part of my singular question
 
02:24:16.490 --> 02:24:16.500 align:start position:0%
uh on line 20 uh uh the new language in
 
02:24:21.050 --> 02:24:21.060 align:start position:0%
this uh requested a change I just want
 
02:24:24.050 --> 02:24:24.060 align:start position:0%
to be clear this is on any group of
 
02:24:27.670 --> 02:24:27.680 align:start position:0%
employees so once you set up your cycle
 
02:24:31.250 --> 02:24:31.260 align:start position:0%
uh if you did teachers today you could
 
02:24:34.610 --> 02:24:34.620 align:start position:0%
not do teacher X next year
 
02:24:37.010 --> 02:24:37.020 align:start position:0%
because you did it today is that correct
 
02:24:38.510 --> 02:24:38.520 align:start position:0%
um again I think that would depend upon
 
02:24:40.550 --> 02:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
specifically what we negotiated but that
 
02:24:42.590 --> 02:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
would be the intent and I I do want to
 
02:24:44.150 --> 02:24:44.160 align:start position:0%
be clear this is not about singling
 
02:24:46.490 --> 02:24:46.500 align:start position:0%
anyone out it's not about I line
 
02:24:48.170 --> 02:24:48.180 align:start position:0%
teachers up and I I want to do a
 
02:24:49.910 --> 02:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
background check on you and you and you
 
02:24:52.309 --> 02:24:52.319 align:start position:0%
this is about everybody all together so
 
02:24:54.349 --> 02:24:54.359 align:start position:0%
I understand that but but I want I just
 
02:24:55.910 --> 02:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
want to be clear if perhaps
 
02:24:57.590 --> 02:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
representative ladder someone else can
 
02:24:59.389 --> 02:24:59.399 align:start position:0%
interpret this for me but I can I'm
 
02:25:01.610 --> 02:25:01.620 align:start position:0%
looking at line 20 and it just as it
 
02:25:05.090 --> 02:25:05.100 align:start position:0%
says on any group of employees so I'm
 
02:25:07.969 --> 02:25:07.979 align:start position:0%
just that would preclude you from doing
 
02:25:09.650 --> 02:25:09.660 align:start position:0%
employee X
 
02:25:12.710 --> 02:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
correct unless you do all employee X is
 
02:25:15.290 --> 02:25:15.300 align:start position:0%
correct that that was the intent okay
 
02:25:16.730 --> 02:25:16.740 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you chairman thank you
 
02:25:18.530 --> 02:25:18.540 align:start position:0%
uh I'm gonna stop with the questions

good morning for the record my name is
 
02:25:56.750 --> 02:25:56.760 align:start position:0%
Diana Fenton I'm an attorney with the
 
02:25:58.309 --> 02:25:58.319 align:start position:0%
Department of Education most of the
 
02:26:00.710 --> 02:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
statutory changes that were mentioned as
 
02:26:04.370 --> 02:26:04.380 align:start position:0%
it pertains to RSA 18913a
 
02:26:07.610 --> 02:26:07.620 align:start position:0%
um we're spearheaded uh by myself at the
 
02:26:10.130 --> 02:26:10.140 align:start position:0%
department with the understanding that
 
02:26:11.570 --> 02:26:11.580 align:start position:0%
when I was transferred over from the
 
02:26:12.889 --> 02:26:12.899 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office to the
 
02:26:14.630 --> 02:26:14.640 align:start position:0%
Department of Education now the
 
02:26:16.490 --> 02:26:16.500 align:start position:0%
department was really lacking in child
 
02:26:18.950 --> 02:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
safety initiatives so I'm happy to give
 
02:26:22.190 --> 02:26:22.200 align:start position:0%
this committee a brief overview of
 
02:26:24.950 --> 02:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
um the changes that have occurred in 189
 
02:26:26.990 --> 02:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
13A and to answer some of the questions
 
02:26:29.450 --> 02:26:29.460 align:start position:0%
that were raised however you'd like me
 
02:26:30.710 --> 02:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
to proceed
 
02:26:32.510 --> 02:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for our
 
02:26:35.870 --> 02:26:35.880 align:start position:0%
representative yes representative Luna
 
02:26:37.670 --> 02:26:37.680 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you very much
 
02:26:39.590 --> 02:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you very much Jennifer
 
02:26:43.670 --> 02:26:43.680 align:start position:0%
for joining us um and maybe you can do
 
02:26:46.070 --> 02:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
this you know while you're um uh while
 
02:26:47.090 --> 02:26:47.100 align:start position:0%
you're sort of laying the ground
 
02:26:50.270 --> 02:26:50.280 align:start position:0%
groundwork uh for this but but
 
02:26:51.950 --> 02:26:51.960 align:start position:0%
um you know over the over the past
 
02:26:53.690 --> 02:26:53.700 align:start position:0%
session I think we dealt with a number
 
02:26:58.309 --> 02:26:58.319 align:start position:0%
of bills that um that made changes to
 
02:26:59.809 --> 02:26:59.819 align:start position:0%
criminal background checks and I think
 
02:27:02.210 --> 02:27:02.220 align:start position:0%
one of the one of the most interesting
 
02:27:02.220 --> 02:27:03.170 align:start position:0%
one of the one of the most interesting
ones

02:27:03.170 --> 02:27:03.180 align:start position:0%
ones
 
02:27:06.469 --> 02:27:06.479 align:start position:0%
was some House Bill 1398
 
02:27:08.450 --> 02:27:08.460 align:start position:0%
um Prime sponsor was representative
 
02:27:12.050 --> 02:27:12.060 align:start position:0%
Carol McGuire uh which uh which actually
 
02:27:12.060 --> 02:27:12.650 align:start position:0%
Carol McGuire uh which uh which actually
um

02:27:12.650 --> 02:27:12.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:15.650 --> 02:27:15.660 align:start position:0%
um establishes a study committee
 
02:27:18.530 --> 02:27:18.540 align:start position:0%
commission committee to um to examine
 
02:27:20.750 --> 02:27:20.760 align:start position:0%
the feasibility of the department
 
02:27:23.389 --> 02:27:23.399 align:start position:0%
um uh centralizing uh criminal records
 
02:27:25.190 --> 02:27:25.200 align:start position:0%
check and I knew there were there were
 
02:27:29.270 --> 02:27:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:33.110 --> 02:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
you know concern confusion how to manage
 
02:27:35.150 --> 02:27:35.160 align:start position:0%
that at a local level how to manage that
 
02:27:36.889 --> 02:27:36.899 align:start position:0%
with between
 
02:27:38.750 --> 02:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
um multiple districts that may be part
 
02:27:41.389 --> 02:27:41.399 align:start position:0%
of an SAU or people that work across
 
02:27:43.309 --> 02:27:43.319 align:start position:0%
different districts or something like
 
02:27:43.319 --> 02:27:44.330 align:start position:0%
different districts or something like
that

02:27:44.330 --> 02:27:44.340 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:27:47.389 --> 02:27:47.399 align:start position:0%
um and then um I what what the
 
02:27:50.330 --> 02:27:50.340 align:start position:0%
superintendent brought up was the um the
 
02:27:52.130 --> 02:27:52.140 align:start position:0%
uh the three-year recertification
 
02:27:54.469 --> 02:27:54.479 align:start position:0%
process and and I guess I'm wondering
 
02:27:58.309 --> 02:27:58.319 align:start position:0%
about your thoughts on how maybe uh uh
 
02:28:01.670 --> 02:28:01.680 align:start position:0%
something like that like this
 
02:28:04.250 --> 02:28:04.260 align:start position:0%
um a periodic
 
02:28:04.260 --> 02:28:05.450 align:start position:0%
um a periodic
um

02:28:05.450 --> 02:28:05.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:08.450 --> 02:28:08.460 align:start position:0%
check uh might be uh might be something
 
02:28:11.210 --> 02:28:11.220 align:start position:0%
that gets incorporated into the the
 
02:28:16.130 --> 02:28:16.140 align:start position:0%
study uh of you know when household 1398
 
02:28:19.070 --> 02:28:19.080 align:start position:0%
um uh is taken up and uh has I think the
 
02:28:22.309 --> 02:28:22.319 align:start position:0%
report due date is November of this year
 
02:28:24.530 --> 02:28:24.540 align:start position:0%
so this is something that's currently I
 
02:28:26.150 --> 02:28:26.160 align:start position:0%
think active
 
02:28:28.070 --> 02:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
um in terms of uh how do we really go
 
02:28:30.230 --> 02:28:30.240 align:start position:0%
about providing comprehensive criminal
 
02:28:32.330 --> 02:28:32.340 align:start position:0%
background checks in a way that's uh
 
02:28:35.750 --> 02:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
that's meaningful and useful to um to
 
02:28:37.429 --> 02:28:37.439 align:start position:0%
school districts and the people that
 
02:28:39.349 --> 02:28:39.359 align:start position:0%
they serve
 
02:28:42.230 --> 02:28:42.240 align:start position:0%
yes so thank you for the question
 
02:28:44.929 --> 02:28:44.939 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to answer your question in
 
02:28:46.910 --> 02:28:46.920 align:start position:0%
somewhat of a long historical approach
 
02:28:49.370 --> 02:28:49.380 align:start position:0%
so bear with me the statute in front of
 
02:28:53.389 --> 02:28:53.399 align:start position:0%
you 189 13A and the proposed Bill 189
 
02:28:57.050 --> 02:28:57.060 align:start position:0%
13A deals exclusively with employment
 
02:28:59.929 --> 02:28:59.939 align:start position:0%
and you have to keep those two different
 
02:29:02.750 --> 02:29:02.760 align:start position:0%
tracks in mind there's employment and
 
02:29:04.610 --> 02:29:04.620 align:start position:0%
then there's the licensing process at
 
02:29:06.650 --> 02:29:06.660 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education and those
 
02:29:09.950 --> 02:29:09.960 align:start position:0%
are two separate entities so the statute
 
02:29:11.690 --> 02:29:11.700 align:start position:0%
in front of you and the bill in front of
 
02:29:16.309 --> 02:29:16.319 align:start position:0%
you again 189 13A is employment based so
 
02:29:19.370 --> 02:29:19.380 align:start position:0%
if I were an educator and I went to
 
02:29:21.290 --> 02:29:21.300 align:start position:0%
representative cascad in the former
 
02:29:23.690 --> 02:29:23.700 align:start position:0%
district and applied for a job in her
 
02:29:25.490 --> 02:29:25.500 align:start position:0%
old role as superintendent she would do
 
02:29:27.590 --> 02:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
a background check on me and determine
 
02:29:30.790 --> 02:29:30.800 align:start position:0%
if I was a good fit for her District
 
02:29:35.270 --> 02:29:35.280 align:start position:0%
historically prior to 2015 when that
 
02:29:37.190 --> 02:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
background check for employment was
 
02:29:37.200 --> 02:29:38.389 align:start position:0%
background check for employment was
conducted

02:29:38.389 --> 02:29:38.399 align:start position:0%
conducted
 
02:29:40.370 --> 02:29:40.380 align:start position:0%
the records would go to the Department
 
02:29:42.349 --> 02:29:42.359 align:start position:0%
of Safety you will see a gentleman in
 
02:29:45.050 --> 02:29:45.060 align:start position:0%
green sitting behind me anytime this
 
02:29:46.969 --> 02:29:46.979 align:start position:0%
committee deals with background checks
 
02:29:51.170 --> 02:29:51.180 align:start position:0%
anything with 189 13 a b or c you will
 
02:29:53.809 --> 02:29:53.819 align:start position:0%
see state police come and join us
 
02:29:57.410 --> 02:29:57.420 align:start position:0%
because our world suddenly collide the
 
02:29:59.090 --> 02:29:59.100 align:start position:0%
Department of Education is not in charge
 
02:30:01.429 --> 02:30:01.439 align:start position:0%
of criminal records criminal records are
 
02:30:04.190 --> 02:30:04.200 align:start position:0%
governed by the by the FBI and there are
 
02:30:06.170 --> 02:30:06.180 align:start position:0%
federal regulations in place because of
 
02:30:08.570 --> 02:30:08.580 align:start position:0%
that so
 
02:30:13.070 --> 02:30:13.080 align:start position:0%
with employment prior to 2015 and again
 
02:30:14.270 --> 02:30:14.280 align:start position:0%
I'm going to pick on representative
 
02:30:16.010 --> 02:30:16.020 align:start position:0%
cascaden in her formal role as a
 
02:30:18.710 --> 02:30:18.720 align:start position:0%
superintendent those those criminal
 
02:30:20.690 --> 02:30:20.700 align:start position:0%
records for me for employment purposes
 
02:30:22.250 --> 02:30:22.260 align:start position:0%
would be sent to the Department of
 
02:30:22.260 --> 02:30:23.270 align:start position:0%
would be sent to the Department of
Safety

02:30:23.270 --> 02:30:23.280 align:start position:0%
Safety
 
02:30:26.090 --> 02:30:26.100 align:start position:0%
they would look at my record and they
 
02:30:28.250 --> 02:30:28.260 align:start position:0%
would determine based on the statute
 
02:30:30.410 --> 02:30:30.420 align:start position:0%
looking at at Roman numeral five which
 
02:30:32.870 --> 02:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
sets out those disqualifying offenses
 
02:30:35.210 --> 02:30:35.220 align:start position:0%
that were mentioned they would look at
 
02:30:37.490 --> 02:30:37.500 align:start position:0%
my record and they would say does Miss
 
02:30:39.290 --> 02:30:39.300 align:start position:0%
Fenton have any of this these
 
02:30:41.389 --> 02:30:41.399 align:start position:0%
disqualifying offenses this is what you
 
02:30:44.030 --> 02:30:44.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned and then they would write a
 
02:30:44.040 --> 02:30:44.809 align:start position:0%
mentioned and then they would write a
letter

02:30:44.809 --> 02:30:44.819 align:start position:0%
letter
 
02:30:47.870 --> 02:30:47.880 align:start position:0%
to the to the school district and they
 
02:30:51.469 --> 02:30:51.479 align:start position:0%
would say Miss Fenton either does have a
 
02:30:53.210 --> 02:30:53.220 align:start position:0%
disqualifying offense pursuant to
 
02:30:55.490 --> 02:30:55.500 align:start position:0%
section five and therefore cannot be
 
02:30:55.500 --> 02:30:56.510 align:start position:0%
section five and therefore cannot be
hired

02:30:56.510 --> 02:30:56.520 align:start position:0%
hired
 
02:30:58.190 --> 02:30:58.200 align:start position:0%
right no discretion on the
 
02:31:01.670 --> 02:31:01.680 align:start position:0%
superintendent or she does not have such
 
02:31:04.070 --> 02:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
an offense and you can hire her if you
 
02:31:06.830 --> 02:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
so wish but it was kind of The Man
 
02:31:09.889 --> 02:31:09.899 align:start position:0%
Behind the Green curtain no one knew if
 
02:31:11.630 --> 02:31:11.640 align:start position:0%
there were other offenses
 
02:31:14.690 --> 02:31:14.700 align:start position:0%
right or what those offenses were
 
02:31:17.450 --> 02:31:17.460 align:start position:0%
it was what I called I called it the red
 
02:31:18.950 --> 02:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
light green light letter
 
02:31:21.170 --> 02:31:21.180 align:start position:0%
because it had no detail it simply said
 
02:31:22.969 --> 02:31:22.979 align:start position:0%
yes the person has an offense and you
 
02:31:24.710 --> 02:31:24.720 align:start position:0%
can't hire them or they don't have one
 
02:31:26.690 --> 02:31:26.700 align:start position:0%
of those disqualifiers and you can hire
 
02:31:29.510 --> 02:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
them here's what happened with that
 
02:31:29.520 --> 02:31:30.469 align:start position:0%
them here's what happened with that
system

02:31:30.469 --> 02:31:30.479 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:31:32.570 --> 02:31:32.580 align:start position:0%
there was an educator who was charged
 
02:31:35.630 --> 02:31:35.640 align:start position:0%
with a very serious sexual assaults uh
 
02:31:37.849 --> 02:31:37.859 align:start position:0%
aggravated felonious sexual assaults in
 
02:31:39.230 --> 02:31:39.240 align:start position:0%
Sullivan County
 
02:31:42.349 --> 02:31:42.359 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason those charges were
 
02:31:45.349 --> 02:31:45.359 align:start position:0%
reduced to misdemeanor level offenses
 
02:31:49.730 --> 02:31:49.740 align:start position:0%
they were not Section 5 offenses they
 
02:31:51.710 --> 02:31:51.720 align:start position:0%
were still serious there was still
 
02:31:53.510 --> 02:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
something superintendents wanted and
 
02:31:55.550 --> 02:31:55.560 align:start position:0%
should have known about as it pertains
 
02:31:57.650 --> 02:31:57.660 align:start position:0%
to child safety but when the department
 
02:31:59.809 --> 02:31:59.819 align:start position:0%
of safety ran that individual's record
 
02:32:01.610 --> 02:32:01.620 align:start position:0%
when he applied for another job in
 
02:32:03.230 --> 02:32:03.240 align:start position:0%
another District
 
02:32:06.349 --> 02:32:06.359 align:start position:0%
the person running the record said
 
02:32:08.750 --> 02:32:08.760 align:start position:0%
these are troubling but they're not
 
02:32:11.210 --> 02:32:11.220 align:start position:0%
Section 5 offenses and so the letter
 
02:32:14.210 --> 02:32:14.220 align:start position:0%
simply stated this individual does not
 
02:32:17.330 --> 02:32:17.340 align:start position:0%
have any of these offenses the
 
02:32:20.030 --> 02:32:20.040 align:start position:0%
superintendent hired that person and he
 
02:32:20.040 --> 02:32:21.349 align:start position:0%
superintendent hired that person and he
reoffended

02:32:21.349 --> 02:32:21.359 align:start position:0%
reoffended
 
02:32:24.170 --> 02:32:24.180 align:start position:0%
that really kicked off
 
02:32:27.290 --> 02:32:27.300 align:start position:0%
the changes that were mentioned prior to
 
02:32:31.070 --> 02:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
2000 and after 2015 we saw a flurry of
 
02:32:34.030 --> 02:32:34.040 align:start position:0%
legislative activity in
 
02:32:36.650 --> 02:32:36.660 align:start position:0%
2016-2017-2018 and it was because of
 
02:32:39.050 --> 02:32:39.060 align:start position:0%
that incident you know in essence we
 
02:32:41.270 --> 02:32:41.280 align:start position:0%
wanted to provide more information to
 
02:32:43.190 --> 02:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
superintendents so they could make an
 
02:32:45.349 --> 02:32:45.359 align:start position:0%
informed decision
 
02:32:49.750 --> 02:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
and that's why when you look at 189 13A
 
02:32:52.550 --> 02:32:52.560 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors and felonies the entire
 
02:32:55.809 --> 02:32:55.819 align:start position:0%
record of offenses is being released to
 
02:32:57.950 --> 02:32:57.960 align:start position:0%
superintendents and they have the
 
02:33:00.349 --> 02:33:00.359 align:start position:0%
discretion within section five to say
 
02:33:03.050 --> 02:33:03.060 align:start position:0%
the disqualifiers I don't have any any
 
02:33:04.790 --> 02:33:04.800 align:start position:0%
discussion with that those are across
 
02:33:08.270 --> 02:33:08.280 align:start position:0%
the board no discretion I cannot hire if
 
02:33:10.190 --> 02:33:10.200 align:start position:0%
someone has one of those offenses but
 
02:33:12.290 --> 02:33:12.300 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of other offenses that
 
02:33:14.630 --> 02:33:14.640 align:start position:0%
they can take into consideration I think
 
02:33:17.150 --> 02:33:17.160 align:start position:0%
a great one is DWI right they can look
 
02:33:19.670 --> 02:33:19.680 align:start position:0%
to see is that someone that I want in in
 
02:33:22.610 --> 02:33:22.620 align:start position:0%
my district arson was mentioned we have
 
02:33:25.070 --> 02:33:25.080 align:start position:0%
certified Educators who have arson on
 
02:33:26.270 --> 02:33:26.280 align:start position:0%
their record
 
02:33:28.370 --> 02:33:28.380 align:start position:0%
and they are employed in various
 
02:33:28.380 --> 02:33:29.690 align:start position:0%
and they are employed in various
districts

02:33:29.690 --> 02:33:29.700 align:start position:0%
districts
 
02:33:32.030 --> 02:33:32.040 align:start position:0%
um what is lacking from the section 5
 
02:33:34.849 --> 02:33:34.859 align:start position:0%
violations that I find interesting no
 
02:33:37.190 --> 02:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
drug offenses
 
02:33:40.250 --> 02:33:40.260 align:start position:0%
no drug offenses last session we uh did
 
02:33:42.469 --> 02:33:42.479 align:start position:0%
put a bill through that was passed that
 
02:33:45.290 --> 02:33:45.300 align:start position:0%
uh prohibited someone who had a felony
 
02:33:48.349 --> 02:33:48.359 align:start position:0%
level uh drug conviction of possession
 
02:33:50.929 --> 02:33:50.939 align:start position:0%
with intent to distribute it had to be
 
02:33:52.969 --> 02:33:52.979 align:start position:0%
felony level it had to be within the
 
02:33:55.130 --> 02:33:55.140 align:start position:0%
last 10 years and that law becomes
 
02:33:57.590 --> 02:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
effective January 1st so that has just
 
02:33:57.600 --> 02:33:58.730 align:start position:0%
effective January 1st so that has just
started

02:33:58.730 --> 02:33:58.740 align:start position:0%
started
 
02:34:01.429 --> 02:34:01.439 align:start position:0%
that it's just as started but prior to
 
02:34:03.590 --> 02:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
that no drug offenses
 
02:34:06.050 --> 02:34:06.060 align:start position:0%
so that's all employment based the
 
02:34:07.790 --> 02:34:07.800 align:start position:0%
superintendent has an enormous amount of
 
02:34:09.710 --> 02:34:09.720 align:start position:0%
discretion to look at that record in its
 
02:34:12.590 --> 02:34:12.600 align:start position:0%
entirety and decide is this the right
 
02:34:15.410 --> 02:34:15.420 align:start position:0%
fit for my district
 
02:34:17.990 --> 02:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
putting that aside for a minute let's
 
02:34:20.450 --> 02:34:20.460 align:start position:0%
talk about the parallel track
 
02:34:22.550 --> 02:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education realized
 
02:34:24.110 --> 02:34:24.120 align:start position:0%
that the Department issues the
 
02:34:26.809 --> 02:34:26.819 align:start position:0%
credential to teach and because of that
 
02:34:29.389 --> 02:34:29.399 align:start position:0%
we have a child safety obligation as
 
02:34:29.399 --> 02:34:30.410 align:start position:0%
we have a child safety obligation as
well

02:34:30.410 --> 02:34:30.420 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:34:32.570 --> 02:34:32.580 align:start position:0%
so we beca we came before this
 
02:34:35.389 --> 02:34:35.399 align:start position:0%
legislative body as a state agency and
 
02:34:37.870 --> 02:34:37.880 align:start position:0%
asked for statutory permission
 
02:34:40.910 --> 02:34:40.920 align:start position:0%
to run a criminal records check on
 
02:34:43.490 --> 02:34:43.500 align:start position:0%
individuals before we license them to
 
02:34:48.170 --> 02:34:48.180 align:start position:0%
teach and you will find that in 189 13c
 
02:34:51.889 --> 02:34:51.899 align:start position:0%
it's named 189 13c for credentialing
 
02:34:54.290 --> 02:34:54.300 align:start position:0%
that's how I remember it anyway and I'll
 
02:34:57.410 --> 02:34:57.420 align:start position:0%
give you a tip 18913b that's for bus
 
02:34:59.690 --> 02:34:59.700 align:start position:0%
driver B for bus driver it's the only
 
02:35:02.809 --> 02:35:02.819 align:start position:0%
way my brain works so
 
02:35:04.969 --> 02:35:04.979 align:start position:0%
it was done for a reason that way I
 
02:35:09.710 --> 02:35:09.720 align:start position:0%
promise you so 189 13c was created as a
 
02:35:12.530 --> 02:35:12.540 align:start position:0%
parallel track to employment
 
02:35:14.809 --> 02:35:14.819 align:start position:0%
to give the department the authority to
 
02:35:17.270 --> 02:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
start to run records checks for
 
02:35:19.490 --> 02:35:19.500 align:start position:0%
first-time educator applicants so that
 
02:35:21.170 --> 02:35:21.180 align:start position:0%
can be someone right out of Keene State
 
02:35:23.210 --> 02:35:23.220 align:start position:0%
or it could be someone transferring in
 
02:35:24.650 --> 02:35:24.660 align:start position:0%
from a different state
 
02:35:26.510 --> 02:35:26.520 align:start position:0%
right who has been an educator in
 
02:35:28.429 --> 02:35:28.439 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts for 20 years but they're
 
02:35:30.710 --> 02:35:30.720 align:start position:0%
new to New Hampshire
 
02:35:33.889 --> 02:35:33.899 align:start position:0%
the difference between the two checks is
 
02:35:36.469 --> 02:35:36.479 align:start position:0%
that the department is limited only to
 
02:35:39.170 --> 02:35:39.180 align:start position:0%
those Section 5 violations only to those
 
02:35:42.230 --> 02:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
disqualifiers the reason being is as a
 
02:35:44.990 --> 02:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
state agency we do not want to license
 
02:35:48.469 --> 02:35:48.479 align:start position:0%
someone who is unemployable
 
02:35:50.330 --> 02:35:50.340 align:start position:0%
that was the whole thought behind it we
 
02:35:52.610 --> 02:35:52.620 align:start position:0%
don't want to license someone allow them
 
02:35:55.250 --> 02:35:55.260 align:start position:0%
that certificate that license uh when
 
02:35:56.510 --> 02:35:56.520 align:start position:0%
they can't be employed in a school
 
02:35:58.490 --> 02:35:58.500 align:start position:0%
district we felt that as a state agency
 
02:36:00.889 --> 02:36:00.899 align:start position:0%
that didn't support the field
 
02:36:04.610 --> 02:36:04.620 align:start position:0%
and that wasn't helpful for child safety
 
02:36:06.770 --> 02:36:06.780 align:start position:0%
and so those are the two parallel tracks
 
02:36:08.510 --> 02:36:08.520 align:start position:0%
that have been created if you think
 
02:36:11.270 --> 02:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
about it in this sense the department is
 
02:36:14.870 --> 02:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
the floor of protection right we're just
 
02:36:16.490 --> 02:36:16.500 align:start position:0%
going to screen for those Section 5
 
02:36:18.950 --> 02:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
violations to say is this person
 
02:36:18.960 --> 02:36:20.570 align:start position:0%
violations to say is this person
employable

02:36:20.570 --> 02:36:20.580 align:start position:0%
employable
 
02:36:24.170 --> 02:36:24.180 align:start position:0%
the districts have much more discretion
 
02:36:25.670 --> 02:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
to say
 
02:36:28.190 --> 02:36:28.200 align:start position:0%
yes this person is employable but
 
02:36:30.050 --> 02:36:30.060 align:start position:0%
perhaps they're not the right fit for my
 
02:36:32.030 --> 02:36:32.040 align:start position:0%
district so I go back to that DWI
 
02:36:32.040 --> 02:36:34.130 align:start position:0%
district so I go back to that DWI
example

02:36:34.130 --> 02:36:34.140 align:start position:0%
example
 
02:36:37.190 --> 02:36:37.200 align:start position:0%
the the department will license someone
 
02:36:39.770 --> 02:36:39.780 align:start position:0%
to teach who has a DWI on their record
 
02:36:43.910 --> 02:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
maybe two DWIs why because it is not a
 
02:36:45.830 --> 02:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
disqualifying offense
 
02:36:47.450 --> 02:36:47.460 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
02:36:49.730 --> 02:36:49.740 align:start position:0%
but a district can take that information
 
02:36:52.010 --> 02:36:52.020 align:start position:0%
into account when making a hiring
 
02:36:52.020 --> 02:36:54.349 align:start position:0%
into account when making a hiring
decision

02:36:54.349 --> 02:36:54.359 align:start position:0%
decision
 
02:36:57.830 --> 02:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
so getting back on my long-winded tour
 
02:37:00.530 --> 02:37:00.540 align:start position:0%
to representative Luna's question the
 
02:37:02.690 --> 02:37:02.700 align:start position:0%
study commission that was created the
 
02:37:06.110 --> 02:37:06.120 align:start position:0%
idea behind it was to say what other
 
02:37:08.150 --> 02:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
function can the Department of Education
 
02:37:10.190 --> 02:37:10.200 align:start position:0%
serve can it serve as a record
 
02:37:13.010 --> 02:37:13.020 align:start position:0%
Clearinghouse as it does for bus drivers
 
02:37:16.190 --> 02:37:16.200 align:start position:0%
for showing 189 13B right is there
 
02:37:18.889 --> 02:37:18.899 align:start position:0%
another function the department can play
 
02:37:18.899 --> 02:37:20.090 align:start position:0%
another function the department can play
um

02:37:20.090 --> 02:37:20.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:37:22.550 --> 02:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
I have not yet attended one of those
 
02:37:24.650 --> 02:37:24.660 align:start position:0%
meetings I think it is a great idea I
 
02:37:26.570 --> 02:37:26.580 align:start position:0%
the department requested representative
 
02:37:27.950 --> 02:37:27.960 align:start position:0%
McGuire to bring that bill forward
 
02:37:30.230 --> 02:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
because this area needs to be explored
 
02:37:32.030 --> 02:37:32.040 align:start position:0%
it certainly uh has a lot of potential
 
02:37:35.510 --> 02:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
my only caveat is to recognize that this
 
02:37:37.370 --> 02:37:37.380 align:start position:0%
is a new role that the department is
 
02:37:37.380 --> 02:37:38.630 align:start position:0%
is a new role that the department is
playing

02:37:38.630 --> 02:37:38.640 align:start position:0%
playing
 
02:37:40.790 --> 02:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
the department is just now really
 
02:37:43.670 --> 02:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
building the infrastructure for running
 
02:37:45.530 --> 02:37:45.540 align:start position:0%
record checks on first-time educator
 
02:37:47.990 --> 02:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
applicants and we need time to be able
 
02:37:50.510 --> 02:37:50.520 align:start position:0%
to work out all the the issues that will
 
02:37:52.790 --> 02:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
inevitably arise but we have put our
 
02:37:54.410 --> 02:37:54.420 align:start position:0%
plan into place and we are starting to
 
02:37:56.510 --> 02:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
roll that out we're very excited about
 
02:37:58.130 --> 02:37:58.140 align:start position:0%
this new initiative and working with our
 
02:37:59.809 --> 02:37:59.819 align:start position:0%
partners in the field and strengthening
 
02:38:02.929 --> 02:38:02.939 align:start position:0%
child safety but I just always ask I've
 
02:38:04.670 --> 02:38:04.680 align:start position:0%
tested if I did this before that we're
 
02:38:06.770 --> 02:38:06.780 align:start position:0%
not given too much too soon
 
02:38:08.630 --> 02:38:08.640 align:start position:0%
because if we have a crack in the system
 
02:38:11.510 --> 02:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
it's going to impact child safety and
 
02:38:14.389 --> 02:38:14.399 align:start position:0%
that we can't do so I appreciate your
 
02:38:16.010 --> 02:38:16.020 align:start position:0%
question thank you for listening to my
 
02:38:17.870 --> 02:38:17.880 align:start position:0%
long-winded answer and I'm happy to take
 
02:38:19.309 --> 02:38:19.319 align:start position:0%
any additional questions representative
 
02:38:21.770 --> 02:38:21.780 align:start position:0%
Fenton I'd like to follow up to what uh
 
02:38:24.110 --> 02:38:24.120 align:start position:0%
representative was addressing with Carol
 
02:38:26.870 --> 02:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
McGuire's sure bill
 
02:38:28.730 --> 02:38:28.740 align:start position:0%
that would if something's done through
 
02:38:30.710 --> 02:38:30.720 align:start position:0%
Carol McGuire's bill it's going to be
 
02:38:33.130 --> 02:38:33.140 align:start position:0%
done across the board for all districts
 
02:38:36.050 --> 02:38:36.060 align:start position:0%
as far as looking at changes maybe
 
02:38:39.530 --> 02:38:39.540 align:start position:0%
within all all the languages stats we
 
02:38:42.170 --> 02:38:42.180 align:start position:0%
were talking about is there are we
 
02:38:45.110 --> 02:38:45.120 align:start position:0%
opening up a real crack when we're
 
02:38:49.309 --> 02:38:49.319 align:start position:0%
allowing District a now to go ahead and
 
02:38:52.070 --> 02:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
make as what Brian's requesting right
 
02:38:54.469 --> 02:38:54.479 align:start position:0%
now do a criminal check of an employee
 
02:38:54.479 --> 02:38:56.270 align:start position:0%
now do a criminal check of an employee
whenever

02:38:56.270 --> 02:38:56.280 align:start position:0%
whenever
 
02:38:58.969 --> 02:38:58.979 align:start position:0%
and then that person is not hireable
 
02:39:01.250 --> 02:39:01.260 align:start position:0%
there or is not going to be there and
 
02:39:02.630 --> 02:39:02.640 align:start position:0%
they go next door to the abutting
 
02:39:04.130 --> 02:39:04.140 align:start position:0%
districts oh yeah we're going to hire
 
02:39:05.750 --> 02:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
this individual because we don't have
 
02:39:08.150 --> 02:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
the criminal background check are we
 
02:39:09.950 --> 02:39:09.960 align:start position:0%
going to have some conflicts between
 
02:39:12.110 --> 02:39:12.120 align:start position:0%
districts if we don't do something like
 
02:39:14.750 --> 02:39:14.760 align:start position:0%
this on a Statewide basis instead of
 
02:39:17.270 --> 02:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
letting it be a negotiated issue for
 
02:39:20.270 --> 02:39:20.280 align:start position:0%
every District in this state which is
 
02:39:22.630 --> 02:39:22.640 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
02:39:26.150 --> 02:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
difficult to be consistent with
 
02:39:28.849 --> 02:39:28.859 align:start position:0%
you know potentially I will I will
 
02:39:30.650 --> 02:39:30.660 align:start position:0%
clarify a couple of things first and
 
02:39:32.630 --> 02:39:32.640 align:start position:0%
foremost I'm not a representative I just
 
02:39:33.950 --> 02:39:33.960 align:start position:0%
need to correct the record on that one
 
02:39:35.870 --> 02:39:35.880 align:start position:0%
representative LED right you are a
 
02:39:37.370 --> 02:39:37.380 align:start position:0%
general I know those you're very
 
02:39:39.290 --> 02:39:39.300 align:start position:0%
generous in your titles
 
02:39:41.450 --> 02:39:41.460 align:start position:0%
um and I don't think the bill allows for
 
02:39:44.450 --> 02:39:44.460 align:start position:0%
a check whenever the bill I think is
 
02:39:46.490 --> 02:39:46.500 align:start position:0%
very well structured to allow for it to
 
02:39:50.990 --> 02:39:51.000 align:start position:0%
be negotiated at the local level
 
02:39:53.030 --> 02:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
um I can tell you anecdotally that when
 
02:39:55.490 --> 02:39:55.500 align:start position:0%
I started at the department in 2015 I
 
02:39:57.170 --> 02:39:57.180 align:start position:0%
had a superintendent take me aside at a
 
02:39:59.990 --> 02:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
conference and say can I run a records
 
02:40:03.230 --> 02:40:03.240 align:start position:0%
check on a more frequent basis
 
02:40:05.929 --> 02:40:05.939 align:start position:0%
um and so this has been something that's
 
02:40:09.230 --> 02:40:09.240 align:start position:0%
been kind of percolating for a while and
 
02:40:12.770 --> 02:40:12.780 align:start position:0%
when I would speak to Brian about it the
 
02:40:14.330 --> 02:40:14.340 align:start position:0%
decision was made it's something the
 
02:40:15.950 --> 02:40:15.960 align:start position:0%
department was interested in bringing
 
02:40:18.110 --> 02:40:18.120 align:start position:0%
forward but we recognized it wasn't a
 
02:40:19.429 --> 02:40:19.439 align:start position:0%
department bill
 
02:40:22.730 --> 02:40:22.740 align:start position:0%
it's a local level Bill and so we
 
02:40:25.250 --> 02:40:25.260 align:start position:0%
decided to step back I was happy to work
 
02:40:26.929 --> 02:40:26.939 align:start position:0%
with Brian and answer any questions he
 
02:40:29.809 --> 02:40:29.819 align:start position:0%
had but this is an employment issue the
 
02:40:31.130 --> 02:40:31.140 align:start position:0%
department doesn't deal with employment
 
02:40:33.410 --> 02:40:33.420 align:start position:0%
this is employment only and I think you
 
02:40:37.070 --> 02:40:37.080 align:start position:0%
have to trust the field to
 
02:40:40.370 --> 02:40:40.380 align:start position:0%
take this task on and if one district is
 
02:40:41.389 --> 02:40:41.399 align:start position:0%
doing it
 
02:40:43.370 --> 02:40:43.380 align:start position:0%
um I think the other districts will will
 
02:40:46.250 --> 02:40:46.260 align:start position:0%
engage in it as well so I don't think
 
02:40:48.650 --> 02:40:48.660 align:start position:0%
that the vision that you envision will
 
02:40:51.110 --> 02:40:51.120 align:start position:0%
occur I could be wrong but I think that
 
02:40:52.849 --> 02:40:52.859 align:start position:0%
you'll find that every District that
 
02:40:54.230 --> 02:40:54.240 align:start position:0%
I've worked with every superintendent
 
02:40:56.210 --> 02:40:56.220 align:start position:0%
I've spoken to this is their top
 
02:40:56.220 --> 02:40:57.469 align:start position:0%
I've spoken to this is their top
priority

02:40:57.469 --> 02:40:57.479 align:start position:0%
priority
 
02:41:00.050 --> 02:41:00.060 align:start position:0%
this is a tool that will enable them to
 
02:41:02.630 --> 02:41:02.640 align:start position:0%
do this and I would be surprised if if
 
02:41:04.610 --> 02:41:04.620 align:start position:0%
they didn't all take take advantage of
 
02:41:04.620 --> 02:41:05.690 align:start position:0%
they didn't all take take advantage of
it

02:41:05.690 --> 02:41:05.700 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:41:08.150 --> 02:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
um but again that's just my my
 
02:41:10.809 --> 02:41:10.819 align:start position:0%
perception of it thank you
 
02:41:13.090 --> 02:41:13.100 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner
 
02:41:15.469 --> 02:41:15.479 align:start position:0%
thank you I don't want you to get away
 
02:41:18.349 --> 02:41:18.359 align:start position:0%
without a question I I would be remiss
 
02:41:22.490 --> 02:41:22.500 align:start position:0%
if I did so and and this is kind of um a
 
02:41:25.630 --> 02:41:25.640 align:start position:0%
setup question but perfect how frequent
 
02:41:29.210 --> 02:41:29.220 align:start position:0%
would you recommend or do you think
 
02:41:32.270 --> 02:41:32.280 align:start position:0%
background checks should be done in
 
02:41:35.210 --> 02:41:35.220 align:start position:0%
order to minimize the risk
 
02:41:37.190 --> 02:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
at a school
 
02:41:39.110 --> 02:41:39.120 align:start position:0%
well thank you for the question I'm
 
02:41:40.849 --> 02:41:40.859 align:start position:0%
going to take this opportunity to
 
02:41:43.010 --> 02:41:43.020 align:start position:0%
address another question that was raised
 
02:41:45.410 --> 02:41:45.420 align:start position:0%
about if someone had been checked
 
02:41:48.290 --> 02:41:48.300 align:start position:0%
previously or recently can that record
 
02:41:50.870 --> 02:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
be kind of transferred over or relied
 
02:41:50.880 --> 02:41:52.490 align:start position:0%
be kind of transferred over or relied
upon

02:41:52.490 --> 02:41:52.500 align:start position:0%
upon
 
02:41:54.469 --> 02:41:54.479 align:start position:0%
um the short answer to that question is
 
02:41:56.750 --> 02:41:56.760 align:start position:0%
is no it cannot for a variety of reasons
 
02:41:58.670 --> 02:41:58.680 align:start position:0%
first and foremost you always want to be
 
02:42:00.710 --> 02:42:00.720 align:start position:0%
careful of stale records and that is a
 
02:42:02.570 --> 02:42:02.580 align:start position:0%
term of art when you start working in
 
02:42:03.950 --> 02:42:03.960 align:start position:0%
criminal records which representative
 
02:42:06.530 --> 02:42:06.540 align:start position:0%
Tanner is very familiar with recognizing
 
02:42:08.090 --> 02:42:08.100 align:start position:0%
that today you run my criminal record
 
02:42:10.070 --> 02:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
it's clean
 
02:42:12.230 --> 02:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
and tomorrow it could change because
 
02:42:13.670 --> 02:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
tonight I'm going to go out and rob a
 
02:42:14.870 --> 02:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
bank or something like that so that's
 
02:42:16.550 --> 02:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
always the anecdotal story that you will
 
02:42:19.250 --> 02:42:19.260 align:start position:0%
hear from State Police
 
02:42:21.410 --> 02:42:21.420 align:start position:0%
um in terms of the stale record piece
 
02:42:23.809 --> 02:42:23.819 align:start position:0%
the other thing to rec recognize and
 
02:42:26.210 --> 02:42:26.220 align:start position:0%
remember with criminal records is now
 
02:42:28.429 --> 02:42:28.439 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with federal regulations
 
02:42:30.410 --> 02:42:30.420 align:start position:0%
and the FBI
 
02:42:32.750 --> 02:42:32.760 align:start position:0%
and they will oversee the dissemination
 
02:42:35.690 --> 02:42:35.700 align:start position:0%
of this record so this bill I will take
 
02:42:37.190 --> 02:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
the wind out of state police of sale
 
02:42:39.710 --> 02:42:39.720 align:start position:0%
this bill will have to be vetted by the
 
02:42:41.809 --> 02:42:41.819 align:start position:0%
FBI before it's enacted
 
02:42:43.670 --> 02:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
it can be passed by this legislative
 
02:42:46.250 --> 02:42:46.260 align:start position:0%
body and become law but it will not be
 
02:42:49.309 --> 02:42:49.319 align:start position:0%
acted upon until the FBI and the federal
 
02:42:52.670 --> 02:42:52.680 align:start position:0%
government say yes we approve it and we
 
02:42:55.429 --> 02:42:55.439 align:start position:0%
have had to deal with that hurdle in all
 
02:42:56.870 --> 02:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
the bills that have come before this
 
02:42:58.790 --> 02:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
legislative committee as it pertains to
 
02:43:03.889 --> 02:43:03.899 align:start position:0%
189 13 a c and and B B and C there we go
 
02:43:03.899 --> 02:43:04.670 align:start position:0%
189 13 a c and and B B and C there we go
um

02:43:04.670 --> 02:43:04.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:43:06.830 --> 02:43:06.840 align:start position:0%
so that's an additional hurdle to to
 
02:43:09.889 --> 02:43:09.899 align:start position:0%
recognize the FBI prohibits me from
 
02:43:12.230 --> 02:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
getting a record and handing it over to
 
02:43:14.389 --> 02:43:14.399 align:start position:0%
another District it violates their
 
02:43:14.399 --> 02:43:15.889 align:start position:0%
another District it violates their
regulations

02:43:15.889 --> 02:43:15.899 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
02:43:19.250 --> 02:43:19.260 align:start position:0%
um your question how often do I think it
 
02:43:20.809 --> 02:43:20.819 align:start position:0%
really doesn't matter what I think
 
02:43:20.819 --> 02:43:22.490 align:start position:0%
really doesn't matter what I think
personally

02:43:22.490 --> 02:43:22.500 align:start position:0%
personally
 
02:43:25.490 --> 02:43:25.500 align:start position:0%
um I think the the three-year cycle
 
02:43:28.910 --> 02:43:28.920 align:start position:0%
basing it on the renewals
 
02:43:31.370 --> 02:43:31.380 align:start position:0%
makes logical sense
 
02:43:33.530 --> 02:43:33.540 align:start position:0%
but I think the strength of this bill
 
02:43:36.170 --> 02:43:36.180 align:start position:0%
before this committee is it defers to
 
02:43:37.610 --> 02:43:37.620 align:start position:0%
local control
 
02:43:40.190 --> 02:43:40.200 align:start position:0%
and it allows them to work that out and
 
02:43:42.889 --> 02:43:42.899 align:start position:0%
negotiate it as to what works for that
 
02:43:45.110 --> 02:43:45.120 align:start position:0%
particular District I can tell you right
 
02:43:48.170 --> 02:43:48.180 align:start position:0%
now the department does not do an
 
02:43:49.969 --> 02:43:49.979 align:start position:0%
additional criminal records check upon
 
02:43:52.670 --> 02:43:52.680 align:start position:0%
renewal we don't we don't have any plans
 
02:43:54.230 --> 02:43:54.240 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
02:43:56.510 --> 02:43:56.520 align:start position:0%
we only do it for that first time
 
02:43:58.790 --> 02:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
educator applicant whether that's right
 
02:44:01.429 --> 02:44:01.439 align:start position:0%
out of college or someone coming into to
 
02:44:03.170 --> 02:44:03.180 align:start position:0%
this state
 
02:44:03.180 --> 02:44:06.230 align:start position:0%
this state
yes

02:44:06.230 --> 02:44:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:06.240 --> 02:44:08.030 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:44:08.030 --> 02:44:08.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:44:10.309 --> 02:44:10.319 align:start position:0%
um I taught for 35 years long time ago
 
02:44:12.670 --> 02:44:12.680 align:start position:0%
when the dinosaurs roamed on the land
 
02:44:15.349 --> 02:44:15.359 align:start position:0%
and every three years I had to get a
 
02:44:17.090 --> 02:44:17.100 align:start position:0%
background check when I renewed my
 
02:44:18.889 --> 02:44:18.899 align:start position:0%
license I'm I'm wondering when the
 
02:44:20.750 --> 02:44:20.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Education stopped doing
 
02:44:20.760 --> 02:44:22.190 align:start position:0%
Department of Education stopped doing
that

02:44:22.190 --> 02:44:22.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:44:26.090 --> 02:44:26.100 align:start position:0%
I'm you know I believe
 
02:44:28.550 --> 02:44:28.560 align:start position:0%
um I think
 
02:44:32.330 --> 02:44:32.340 align:start position:0%
there's I think we used to do them until
 
02:44:34.010 --> 02:44:34.020 align:start position:0%
the 90s
 
02:44:36.830 --> 02:44:36.840 align:start position:0%
maybe 95 96
 
02:44:39.349 --> 02:44:39.359 align:start position:0%
and then we stopped that practice for a
 
02:44:40.969 --> 02:44:40.979 align:start position:0%
significant amount of time
 
02:44:43.429 --> 02:44:43.439 align:start position:0%
and now we're we're doing that again and
 
02:44:45.889 --> 02:44:45.899 align:start position:0%
we certainly are open to the discussion
 
02:44:47.630 --> 02:44:47.640 align:start position:0%
of doing those criminal histories upon
 
02:44:47.640 --> 02:44:48.830 align:start position:0%
of doing those criminal histories upon
renewal

02:44:48.830 --> 02:44:48.840 align:start position:0%
renewal
 
02:44:50.450 --> 02:44:50.460 align:start position:0%
I would hope that that's part of that
 
02:44:52.610 --> 02:44:52.620 align:start position:0%
study commission idea
 
02:44:55.849 --> 02:44:55.859 align:start position:0%
um that was mentioned but right now we
 
02:44:57.830 --> 02:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
are just rolling out the
 
02:44:59.570 --> 02:44:59.580 align:start position:0%
um infrastructure for doing those
 
02:45:02.030 --> 02:45:02.040 align:start position:0%
first-time educator applicants
 
02:45:03.950 --> 02:45:03.960 align:start position:0%
representative cascaden and
 
02:45:05.570 --> 02:45:05.580 align:start position:0%
representative Miler anybody on this
 
02:45:05.580 --> 02:45:06.410 align:start position:0%
representative Miler anybody on this
side

02:45:06.410 --> 02:45:06.420 align:start position:0%
side
 
02:45:09.410 --> 02:45:09.420 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Mr chair and thanks Diana
 
02:45:11.570 --> 02:45:11.580 align:start position:0%
for all that work anything we could do
 
02:45:14.330 --> 02:45:14.340 align:start position:0%
any of us um to increase child safety is
 
02:45:17.030 --> 02:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
definitely most valuable and I just go
 
02:45:19.309 --> 02:45:19.319 align:start position:0%
back again to the question that that I
 
02:45:21.349 --> 02:45:21.359 align:start position:0%
asked the superintendent in this Essence
 
02:45:24.230 --> 02:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
the department has a list of service
 
02:45:27.590 --> 02:45:27.600 align:start position:0%
providers paid for and funded by efas
 
02:45:30.710 --> 02:45:30.720 align:start position:0%
including retailers and so my question
 
02:45:33.130 --> 02:45:33.140 align:start position:0%
is if those
 
02:45:35.630 --> 02:45:35.640 align:start position:0%
non-public entities whether they're
 
02:45:37.550 --> 02:45:37.560 align:start position:0%
retailers or private service providers
 
02:45:41.510 --> 02:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
it would seem to me that we would be
 
02:45:44.630 --> 02:45:44.640 align:start position:0%
offering the same or requiring the same
 
02:45:46.370 --> 02:45:46.380 align:start position:0%
as someone who's graduating from college
 
02:45:47.870 --> 02:45:47.880 align:start position:0%
and you're doing a criminal background
 
02:45:50.150 --> 02:45:50.160 align:start position:0%
check before they're employed and I
 
02:45:52.370 --> 02:45:52.380 align:start position:0%
suspect there is a vetting process for
 
02:45:55.130 --> 02:45:55.140 align:start position:0%
them these entities to be on the master
 
02:45:58.250 --> 02:45:58.260 align:start position:0%
list of service providers and just would
 
02:46:01.969 --> 02:46:01.979 align:start position:0%
see that if it might create more buy-in
 
02:46:04.010 --> 02:46:04.020 align:start position:0%
in public schools
 
02:46:07.429 --> 02:46:07.439 align:start position:0%
if everyone who is servicing a child has
 
02:46:10.190 --> 02:46:10.200 align:start position:0%
that same criteria so do you know if
 
02:46:13.010 --> 02:46:13.020 align:start position:0%
that's in the works or my understanding
 
02:46:15.710 --> 02:46:15.720 align:start position:0%
is that is part of the EFA program I can
 
02:46:17.690 --> 02:46:17.700 align:start position:0%
get you more details as it pertains
 
02:46:19.610 --> 02:46:19.620 align:start position:0%
appreciate that thank you happy to do
 
02:46:20.870 --> 02:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
that thank you
 
02:46:24.469 --> 02:46:24.479 align:start position:0%
representative uh thank you Mr chair you
 
02:46:30.230 --> 02:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
referred to a 189 13A BC you've got
 
02:46:32.450 --> 02:46:32.460 align:start position:0%
something in front of you what are you
 
02:46:33.830 --> 02:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
referring to
 
02:46:37.309 --> 02:46:37.319 align:start position:0%
my lava okay that's not the new one is
 
02:46:39.889 --> 02:46:39.899 align:start position:0%
it no my new one's at home and in my
 
02:46:42.050 --> 02:46:42.060 align:start position:0%
office so I have I carry this in my car
 
02:46:45.230 --> 02:46:45.240 align:start position:0%
because I'm a legal dork the the only
 
02:46:47.330 --> 02:46:47.340 align:start position:0%
reason why I raise this is that that the
 
02:46:49.550 --> 02:46:49.560 align:start position:0%
new one is not the book that we have as
 
02:46:51.170 --> 02:46:51.180 align:start position:0%
a committee
 
02:46:54.650 --> 02:46:54.660 align:start position:0%
we have not received the new book yet
 
02:46:58.130 --> 02:46:58.140 align:start position:0%
so for new members of the committee they
 
02:47:00.710 --> 02:47:00.720 align:start position:0%
don't have the yellow book nor the new
 
02:47:00.720 --> 02:47:01.490 align:start position:0%
don't have the yellow book nor the new
book

02:47:01.490 --> 02:47:01.500 align:start position:0%
book
 
02:47:04.910 --> 02:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
and we need to know why we can't get
 
02:47:06.950 --> 02:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
those books okay that's really not
 
02:47:08.950 --> 02:47:08.960 align:start position:0%
that's less that's a rhetorical
 
02:47:11.690 --> 02:47:11.700 align:start position:0%
rhetorical question I we talked about
 
02:47:14.270 --> 02:47:14.280 align:start position:0%
that this morning and we're on it uh I
 
02:47:16.270 --> 02:47:16.280 align:start position:0%
don't think we want to tie up
 
02:47:18.710 --> 02:47:18.720 align:start position:0%
attorney Fenton on that one right now
 
02:47:22.070 --> 02:47:22.080 align:start position:0%
you go to my car and uh take this out of
 
02:47:23.750 --> 02:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
the trunk if you'd like I'll look the
 
02:47:25.490 --> 02:47:25.500 align:start position:0%
other way uh my understanding is
 
02:47:28.190 --> 02:47:28.200 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli's is working on
 
02:47:29.450 --> 02:47:29.460 align:start position:0%
that issue it falls outside of my
 
02:47:31.190 --> 02:47:31.200 align:start position:0%
purview but as I've said to
 
02:47:33.590 --> 02:47:33.600 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner I understand her
 
02:47:35.450 --> 02:47:35.460 align:start position:0%
uh desire for the book because I love
 
02:47:36.950 --> 02:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
them as well so
 
02:47:40.210 --> 02:47:40.220 align:start position:0%
and you got that book from me
 
02:47:42.290 --> 02:47:42.300 align:start position:0%
I'm getting myself and all sorts of
 
02:47:44.210 --> 02:47:44.220 align:start position:0%
trouble here let's let's go on here to
 
02:47:46.670 --> 02:47:46.680 align:start position:0%
representative woodcock
 
02:47:50.870 --> 02:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:53.210 --> 02:47:53.220 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at uh thank you for taking
 
02:47:56.330 --> 02:47:56.340 align:start position:0%
this I appreciate it okay all right uh
 
02:47:57.770 --> 02:47:57.780 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at the same question I asked
 
02:48:00.290 --> 02:48:00.300 align:start position:0%
this of a tenant uh on
 
02:48:02.150 --> 02:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
specifically line 20 of the new language
 
02:48:05.929 --> 02:48:05.939 align:start position:0%
that talks about uh the doing the record
 
02:48:09.710 --> 02:48:09.720 align:start position:0%
check he was talking about on on a cycle
 
02:48:11.330 --> 02:48:11.340 align:start position:0%
um for any group I just want to be clear
 
02:48:11.340 --> 02:48:12.650 align:start position:0%
um for any group I just want to be clear
that

02:48:12.650 --> 02:48:12.660 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:48:14.450 --> 02:48:14.460 align:start position:0%
um your interpretation of this language
 
02:48:18.650 --> 02:48:18.660 align:start position:0%
is similar to his and that an individual
 
02:48:22.010 --> 02:48:22.020 align:start position:0%
employee who is already employed could
 
02:48:24.110 --> 02:48:24.120 align:start position:0%
not be required to get an additional
 
02:48:26.090 --> 02:48:26.100 align:start position:0%
background check at some point until
 
02:48:28.849 --> 02:48:28.859 align:start position:0%
it's the cycle of his group this is that
 
02:48:31.969 --> 02:48:31.979 align:start position:0%
that's my question yeah thank you for
 
02:48:33.469 --> 02:48:33.479 align:start position:0%
your question and when you brought that
 
02:48:36.110 --> 02:48:36.120 align:start position:0%
up I remember looking at this language
 
02:48:36.120 --> 02:48:36.710 align:start position:0%
up I remember looking at this language
um

02:48:36.710 --> 02:48:36.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:48:39.170 --> 02:48:39.180 align:start position:0%
I know that one of our concerned shared
 
02:48:41.150 --> 02:48:41.160 align:start position:0%
concerns when Brian and I met to work on
 
02:48:43.309 --> 02:48:43.319 align:start position:0%
this language was
 
02:48:46.130 --> 02:48:46.140 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to misuse this tool
 
02:48:48.349 --> 02:48:48.359 align:start position:0%
because this really is a is this is a
 
02:48:50.270 --> 02:48:50.280 align:start position:0%
tool for school districts
 
02:48:51.530 --> 02:48:51.540 align:start position:0%
um and I know that he and I had this
 
02:48:53.570 --> 02:48:53.580 align:start position:0%
discussion at length that we didn't want
 
02:48:56.570 --> 02:48:56.580 align:start position:0%
anyone to be able to come in and use it
 
02:48:59.030 --> 02:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
in a vindictive way to Target an
 
02:49:00.590 --> 02:49:00.600 align:start position:0%
individual to say I'm going to go after
 
02:49:02.510 --> 02:49:02.520 align:start position:0%
this person and I think that's why we
 
02:49:05.389 --> 02:49:05.399 align:start position:0%
put that language's language in I don't
 
02:49:08.690 --> 02:49:08.700 align:start position:0%
know if it was my suggestion or Brian's
 
02:49:11.030 --> 02:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
or a combination of the two but we
 
02:49:12.950 --> 02:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
recognize that this is really as I
 
02:49:15.530 --> 02:49:15.540 align:start position:0%
mentioned a strong tool for for school
 
02:49:17.870 --> 02:49:17.880 align:start position:0%
districts and superintendents they have
 
02:49:20.809 --> 02:49:20.819 align:start position:0%
needed this for a long long time what we
 
02:49:22.610 --> 02:49:22.620 align:start position:0%
don't want to have happen is it for it
 
02:49:26.630 --> 02:49:26.640 align:start position:0%
to be misused for a vindictive purpose
 
02:49:28.429 --> 02:49:28.439 align:start position:0%
um and if I may just very quickly
 
02:49:31.910 --> 02:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
piggyback on representative belcher's
 
02:49:31.920 --> 02:49:33.050 align:start position:0%
piggyback on representative belcher's
question

02:49:33.050 --> 02:49:33.060 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:49:34.910 --> 02:49:34.920 align:start position:0%
using the book you don't have in front
 
02:49:36.530 --> 02:49:36.540 align:start position:0%
of you
 
02:49:40.550 --> 02:49:40.560 align:start position:0%
um one 189 13A addresses your question
 
02:49:42.889 --> 02:49:42.899 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral
 
02:49:46.250 --> 02:49:46.260 align:start position:0%
four that says that the schools may
 
02:49:47.870 --> 02:49:47.880 align:start position:0%
require the selected applicant for
 
02:49:50.809 --> 02:49:50.819 align:start position:0%
employment or designated volunteer to
 
02:49:52.429 --> 02:49:52.439 align:start position:0%
pay the actual cost of the criminal
 
02:49:54.050 --> 02:49:54.060 align:start position:0%
history records check
 
02:49:56.210 --> 02:49:56.220 align:start position:0%
most districts for employment purposes
 
02:49:58.550 --> 02:49:58.560 align:start position:0%
absorb that cost it is part of
 
02:50:02.150 --> 02:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
employment for volunteers that cost
 
02:50:04.250 --> 02:50:04.260 align:start position:0%
typically falls on the on the volunteer
 
02:50:06.290 --> 02:50:06.300 align:start position:0%
so I hope that answers your question and
 
02:50:07.849 --> 02:50:07.859 align:start position:0%
you're welcome to use my book to
 
02:50:10.370 --> 02:50:10.380 align:start position:0%
validate it okay thank you uh Diana
 
02:50:10.380 --> 02:50:11.510 align:start position:0%
validate it okay thank you uh Diana
Fenton

02:50:11.510 --> 02:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
Fenton
 
02:50:14.510 --> 02:50:14.520 align:start position:0%
um you referenced that we could pass
 
02:50:16.309 --> 02:50:16.319 align:start position:0%
this as a state but then we're gonna
 
02:50:18.650 --> 02:50:18.660 align:start position:0%
have to deal with the FBI
 
02:50:20.030 --> 02:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to deal with the
 
02:50:23.809 --> 02:50:23.819 align:start position:0%
FBI either way is is similar language or
 
02:50:26.090 --> 02:50:26.100 align:start position:0%
this process
 
02:50:26.100 --> 02:50:27.770 align:start position:0%
this process
already

02:50:27.770 --> 02:50:27.780 align:start position:0%
already
 
02:50:30.710 --> 02:50:30.720 align:start position:0%
in effect in other states we're a very
 
02:50:33.410 --> 02:50:33.420 align:start position:0%
small state here in this country is
 
02:50:36.469 --> 02:50:36.479 align:start position:0%
similar language being applied dealing
 
02:50:39.410 --> 02:50:39.420 align:start position:0%
with employees elsewhere like a Maine or
 
02:50:42.290 --> 02:50:42.300 align:start position:0%
Vermont or Nebraska
 
02:50:43.969 --> 02:50:43.979 align:start position:0%
that's an excellent question I
 
02:50:46.730 --> 02:50:46.740 align:start position:0%
appreciate it I don't know as it
 
02:50:48.710 --> 02:50:48.720 align:start position:0%
pertains to employment
 
02:50:51.950 --> 02:50:51.960 align:start position:0%
how other states handle it I am more on
 
02:50:55.490 --> 02:50:55.500 align:start position:0%
the licensing credentialing end of it
 
02:50:55.500 --> 02:50:56.929 align:start position:0%
the licensing credentialing end of it
um

02:50:56.929 --> 02:50:56.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:51:00.710 --> 02:51:00.720 align:start position:0%
I can tell you anecdotally that as a
 
02:51:03.170 --> 02:51:03.180 align:start position:0%
nation and I go to annual conferences on
 
02:51:05.770 --> 02:51:05.780 align:start position:0%
this particular issue from the licensing
 
02:51:09.349 --> 02:51:09.359 align:start position:0%
piece we recognize that we are in such a
 
02:51:12.349 --> 02:51:12.359 align:start position:0%
movable Society people go across the
 
02:51:15.410 --> 02:51:15.420 align:start position:0%
border so easily and so across the board
 
02:51:18.110 --> 02:51:18.120 align:start position:0%
we are really upping our child safety
 
02:51:20.030 --> 02:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
initiatives because we've had these
 
02:51:22.910 --> 02:51:22.920 align:start position:0%
issues uh happen where one person leaves
 
02:51:26.150 --> 02:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
and pick on Virginia and they go to New
 
02:51:27.770 --> 02:51:27.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and they miss that there's

you
 
02:51:33.290 --> 02:51:33.300 align:start position:0%
um so I'm happy to look into it
 
02:51:35.030 --> 02:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
employment wise
 
02:51:37.309 --> 02:51:37.319 align:start position:0%
as to what other states are doing again
 
02:51:39.290 --> 02:51:39.300 align:start position:0%
we've really focused on that licensure
 
02:51:41.510 --> 02:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
piece so I don't know off the top of my
 
02:51:43.070 --> 02:51:43.080 align:start position:0%
head the answer could you please do a
 
02:51:44.270 --> 02:51:44.280 align:start position:0%
little checking around for it absolutely
 
02:51:45.590 --> 02:51:45.600 align:start position:0%
thank you

yes represent Cornell
 
02:51:52.550 --> 02:51:52.560 align:start position:0%
thank you I don't know if I heard you
 
02:51:54.410 --> 02:51:54.420 align:start position:0%
write attorney Fenton when you were
 
02:51:56.269 --> 02:51:56.279 align:start position:0%
answering rep cascad and did you say
 
02:51:59.210 --> 02:51:59.220 align:start position:0%
that efas you think are requiring these
 
02:52:01.610 --> 02:52:01.620 align:start position:0%
kind of checks every three years already
 
02:52:04.130 --> 02:52:04.140 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure about the every three years
 
02:52:06.469 --> 02:52:06.479 align:start position:0%
I know that the background check is part
 
02:52:08.510 --> 02:52:08.520 align:start position:0%
of the EFA program and I will get you
 
02:52:10.790 --> 02:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
more details as it pertains to that
 
02:52:13.969 --> 02:52:13.979 align:start position:0%
thank you for the further questions
 
02:52:18.710 --> 02:52:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:20.750 --> 02:52:20.760 align:start position:0%
okay do we have any more pink cards up
 
02:52:23.210 --> 02:52:23.220 align:start position:0%
here not seeing any we're going to close
 
02:52:24.490 --> 02:52:24.500 align:start position:0%
this hearing

and start this meeting we finished our
 
03:36:53.389 --> 03:36:53.399 align:start position:0%
last hearing a little bit late so some
 
03:36:55.969 --> 03:36:55.979 align:start position:0%
members are will be coming in uh we're
 
03:36:57.229 --> 03:36:57.239 align:start position:0%
about seven minutes late on this one
 
03:36:59.690 --> 03:36:59.700 align:start position:0%
already so I'd like to open this hearing
 
03:37:03.830 --> 03:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
for HB 377 this is relative to screening
 
03:37:05.510 --> 03:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
and intervention in public schools for
 
03:37:07.849 --> 03:37:07.859 align:start position:0%

03:37:18.650 --> 03:37:18.660 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and to the
 
03:37:20.269 --> 03:37:20.279 align:start position:0%
committee for having me here today I'm
 
03:37:22.250 --> 03:37:22.260 align:start position:0%
representative Caitlin kutab I represent
 
03:37:28.070 --> 03:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:29.870 --> 03:37:29.880 align:start position:0%
I'm here today to introduce House Bill
 
03:37:33.590 --> 03:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
377 House Bill 377 changes the literacy
 
03:37:35.990 --> 03:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
screening requirements for dyslexia in
 
03:37:37.670 --> 03:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
our public schools from Once in
 
03:37:40.250 --> 03:37:40.260 align:start position:0%
kindergarten or first grade and at
 
03:37:43.010 --> 03:37:43.020 align:start position:0%
appropriate times thereafter to twice
 
03:37:45.769 --> 03:37:45.779 align:start position:0%
yearly in grades K to two and it also
 
03:37:48.769 --> 03:37:48.779 align:start position:0%
clarifies the intervention timeline
 
03:37:50.990 --> 03:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
this bill is crucial for ensuring that
 
03:37:52.370 --> 03:37:52.380 align:start position:0%
the children in our state have the
 
03:37:54.469 --> 03:37:54.479 align:start position:0%
opportunity to develop strong literacy
 
03:37:57.070 --> 03:37:57.080 align:start position:0%
skills and succeed in school and in life
 
03:37:59.690 --> 03:37:59.700 align:start position:0%
literacy is the foundation upon which
 
03:38:01.729 --> 03:38:01.739 align:start position:0%
all learning is built and it is crucial
 
03:38:03.349 --> 03:38:03.359 align:start position:0%
that we identify and address any
 
03:38:05.510 --> 03:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
literacy difficulties as early as
 
03:38:05.520 --> 03:38:07.790 align:start position:0%
literacy difficulties as early as
possible

03:38:07.790 --> 03:38:07.800 align:start position:0%
possible
 
03:38:10.070 --> 03:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
being at grade level before third grade
 
03:38:12.410 --> 03:38:12.420 align:start position:0%
is imperative because prior to third
 
03:38:15.229 --> 03:38:15.239 align:start position:0%
grade student students are learning to
 
03:38:15.239 --> 03:38:16.070 align:start position:0%
grade student students are learning to
read

03:38:16.070 --> 03:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
read
 
03:38:19.550 --> 03:38:19.560 align:start position:0%
from third grade on they're reading to
 
03:38:19.560 --> 03:38:21.530 align:start position:0%
from third grade on they're reading to
learn

03:38:21.530 --> 03:38:21.540 align:start position:0%
learn
 
03:38:23.630 --> 03:38:23.640 align:start position:0%
my kindergartner had this screening in
 
03:38:25.070 --> 03:38:25.080 align:start position:0%
October and has been receiving
 
03:38:27.290 --> 03:38:27.300 align:start position:0%
intervention in a month he went from
 
03:38:29.510 --> 03:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
identifying nine capital letter sounds
 
03:38:32.809 --> 03:38:32.819 align:start position:0%
to 20 capital letter sounds doubling his
 
03:38:34.849 --> 03:38:34.859 align:start position:0%
recognition in what he learned in three
 
03:38:38.090 --> 03:38:38.100 align:start position:0%
months without any intervention
 
03:38:39.950 --> 03:38:39.960 align:start position:0%
most of the children receiving special
 
03:38:42.050 --> 03:38:42.060 align:start position:0%
education in the specific learning
 
03:38:44.570 --> 03:38:44.580 align:start position:0%
disability category are dyslexic that's
 
03:38:47.330 --> 03:38:47.340 align:start position:0%
about 10 000 kids in the state of New
 
03:38:50.030 --> 03:38:50.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or one in three of the state's
 
03:38:51.710 --> 03:38:51.720 align:start position:0%
special education
 
03:38:53.870 --> 03:38:53.880 align:start position:0%
when it's caught early it likely makes
 
03:38:55.490 --> 03:38:55.500 align:start position:0%
the difference of only needing
 
03:38:57.790 --> 03:38:57.800 align:start position:0%
intervention and not special education
 
03:39:00.650 --> 03:39:00.660 align:start position:0%
this not only considerably saves money
 
03:39:02.809 --> 03:39:02.819 align:start position:0%
but also significantly increases the
 
03:39:04.849 --> 03:39:04.859 align:start position:0%
likelihood of the child's academic and
 
03:39:06.769 --> 03:39:06.779 align:start position:0%
emotional success
 
03:39:08.570 --> 03:39:08.580 align:start position:0%
you may be wondering why it's needed
 
03:39:11.750 --> 03:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
twice a year through second grade and
 
03:39:13.309 --> 03:39:13.319 align:start position:0%
that's because this is a screening tool
 
03:39:15.830 --> 03:39:15.840 align:start position:0%
it's not diagnostic so some children may
 
03:39:17.809 --> 03:39:17.819 align:start position:0%
be missed the first time so it's
 
03:39:20.090 --> 03:39:20.100 align:start position:0%
important that we monitor their progress
 
03:39:22.309 --> 03:39:22.319 align:start position:0%
some kids may be doing okay at the
 
03:39:23.570 --> 03:39:23.580 align:start position:0%
beginning of the year because their
 
03:39:25.849 --> 03:39:25.859 align:start position:0%
skills match the expected performance at
 
03:39:28.070 --> 03:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
that time in that grade but then as the
 
03:39:29.750 --> 03:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
bar gets raised their skills may not
 
03:39:32.990 --> 03:39:33.000 align:start position:0%
continue to develop with their peers and
 
03:39:34.670 --> 03:39:34.680 align:start position:0%
so if the screening is repeated it can
 
03:39:36.170 --> 03:39:36.180 align:start position:0%
help to determine if their skills have
 
03:39:37.550 --> 03:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
increased according to the higher
 
03:39:40.429 --> 03:39:40.439 align:start position:0%
expectations or not
 
03:39:42.469 --> 03:39:42.479 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education assessment
 
03:39:45.110 --> 03:39:45.120 align:start position:0%
data from last year shows that 55
 
03:39:47.630 --> 03:39:47.640 align:start position:0%
percent of children Statewide cannot
 
03:39:50.389 --> 03:39:50.399 align:start position:0%
read at grade level in New Hampshire our
 
03:39:52.849 --> 03:39:52.859 align:start position:0%
children deserve better this is an easy
 
03:39:54.769 --> 03:39:54.779 align:start position:0%
screening which only takes 10 minutes or
 
03:39:56.510 --> 03:39:56.520 align:start position:0%
less and there are free tools available
 
03:39:59.150 --> 03:39:59.160 align:start position:0%
to do it I urge you to support this bill
 
03:40:00.950 --> 03:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
for the future of our children by
 
03:40:02.570 --> 03:40:02.580 align:start position:0%
ensuring that they have the literacy
 
03:40:05.269 --> 03:40:05.279 align:start position:0%
skills that they need to succeed thank
 
03:40:06.590 --> 03:40:06.600 align:start position:0%
you for your time and consideration
 
03:40:08.389 --> 03:40:08.399 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are you willing to
 
03:40:10.370 --> 03:40:10.380 align:start position:0%
take any questions happy to are there
 
03:40:12.110 --> 03:40:12.120 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee represent
 
03:40:14.750 --> 03:40:14.760 align:start position:0%
cordinelli uh thank you thank you for
 
03:40:17.330 --> 03:40:17.340 align:start position:0%
being here and bringing this forward
 
03:40:20.389 --> 03:40:20.399 align:start position:0%
um I was wondering if if you might know
 
03:40:22.309 --> 03:40:22.319 align:start position:0%
um or maybe someone else who is later
 
03:40:25.610 --> 03:40:25.620 align:start position:0%
testifying might know but the existing
 
03:40:28.490 --> 03:40:28.500 align:start position:0%
statute specifies the Dibbles
 
03:40:31.070 --> 03:40:31.080 align:start position:0%
um screening tool and I heard something
 
03:40:33.830 --> 03:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
yesterday that um maybe
 
03:40:35.929 --> 03:40:35.939 align:start position:0%
um they had been bought by another
 
03:40:37.969 --> 03:40:37.979 align:start position:0%
company or the name had changed or
 
03:40:39.590 --> 03:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
03:40:41.570 --> 03:40:41.580 align:start position:0%
um you know it's one of the dangers of
 
03:40:44.150 --> 03:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
putting a specific product name in a
 
03:40:44.160 --> 03:40:45.290 align:start position:0%
putting a specific product name in a
statute

03:40:45.290 --> 03:40:45.300 align:start position:0%
statute
 
03:40:48.290 --> 03:40:48.300 align:start position:0%
um so if anyone knows it's something
 
03:40:49.969 --> 03:40:49.979 align:start position:0%
maybe we could correct via a simple
 
03:40:49.979 --> 03:40:51.050 align:start position:0%
maybe we could correct via a simple
Amendment

03:40:51.050 --> 03:40:51.060 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
03:40:54.050 --> 03:40:54.060 align:start position:0%
um as part of this process sure so I did
 
03:40:56.030 --> 03:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
check last night and there is still a
 
03:40:58.010 --> 03:40:58.020 align:start position:0%
free version of of the Dibbles tool
 
03:41:00.050 --> 03:41:00.060 align:start position:0%
available online so
 
03:41:03.410 --> 03:41:03.420 align:start position:0%
um it does specify in the Bell or an
 
03:41:05.510 --> 03:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
equivalent evidence-based screener so if
 
03:41:08.750 --> 03:41:08.760 align:start position:0%
that didn't become the choice I'm happy
 
03:41:10.429 --> 03:41:10.439 align:start position:0%
to amend it but if that didn't become
 
03:41:11.990 --> 03:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
the choice of the the school district
 
03:41:14.690 --> 03:41:14.700 align:start position:0%
they do have the leeway to use any
 
03:41:16.309 --> 03:41:16.319 align:start position:0%
evidence-based screening tool that they
 
03:41:17.450 --> 03:41:17.460 align:start position:0%
want to use
 
03:41:18.650 --> 03:41:18.660 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:41:21.530 --> 03:41:21.540 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
03:41:21.540 --> 03:41:23.150 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
yes

03:41:23.150 --> 03:41:23.160 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:41:25.190 --> 03:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
03:41:26.990 --> 03:41:27.000 align:start position:0%
representative kutab
 
03:41:27.000 --> 03:41:29.690 align:start position:0%
representative kutab
um line

03:41:29.690 --> 03:41:29.700 align:start position:0%
um line
 
03:41:32.870 --> 03:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
10 it says in kindergarten or line 10 to
 
03:41:34.670 --> 03:41:34.680 align:start position:0%
11 it says in kindergarten through
 
03:41:36.349 --> 03:41:36.359 align:start position:0%
second the initial screening shall be
 
03:41:38.870 --> 03:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
completed no later than 60 days of a
 
03:41:40.910 --> 03:41:40.920 align:start position:0%
student entering Public School in
 
03:41:43.370 --> 03:41:43.380 align:start position:0%
kindergarten through second grade what
 
03:41:45.170 --> 03:41:45.180 align:start position:0%
if say for example you had a homeschool
 
03:41:47.510 --> 03:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
student who came in in third fourth
 
03:41:49.429 --> 03:41:49.439 align:start position:0%
fifth grade and maybe they had learning
 
03:41:51.410 --> 03:41:51.420 align:start position:0%
issues would they be allowed to be
 
03:41:53.269 --> 03:41:53.279 align:start position:0%
tested for dyslexia
 
03:41:55.370 --> 03:41:55.380 align:start position:0%
sure so this is a screening that would
 
03:41:58.729 --> 03:41:58.739 align:start position:0%
be for the entire population of the
 
03:42:01.790 --> 03:42:01.800 align:start position:0%
school and so for everybody they'd be
 
03:42:03.650 --> 03:42:03.660 align:start position:0%
getting at K to two if somebody entered
 
03:42:05.690 --> 03:42:05.700 align:start position:0%
later after and the school found an
 
03:42:08.570 --> 03:42:08.580 align:start position:0%
issue then absolutely I would agree that
 
03:42:10.010 --> 03:42:10.020 align:start position:0%
they should screen them at that point
 
03:42:13.370 --> 03:42:13.380 align:start position:0%
and I would but it may be repetitive at
 
03:42:15.769 --> 03:42:15.779 align:start position:0%
that point to keep re-screening all of
 
03:42:19.309 --> 03:42:19.319 align:start position:0%
the children of the school rather than
 
03:42:22.130 --> 03:42:22.140 align:start position:0%
just you know new children
 
03:42:25.790 --> 03:42:25.800 align:start position:0%
further questions yes represent dry
 
03:42:27.830 --> 03:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh thank you
 
03:42:27.840 --> 03:42:30.050 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh thank you
representative

03:42:30.050 --> 03:42:30.060 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:42:30.060 --> 03:42:30.650 align:start position:0%
representative
um

03:42:30.650 --> 03:42:30.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:42:32.570 --> 03:42:32.580 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at the the second paragraph
 
03:42:34.130 --> 03:42:34.140 align:start position:0%
which is all italicized which talks
 
03:42:36.290 --> 03:42:36.300 align:start position:0%
about what happens if a screening takes
 
03:42:37.969 --> 03:42:37.979 align:start position:0%
place and there's some method of
 
03:42:40.370 --> 03:42:40.380 align:start position:0%
intervention required I just wonder if
 
03:42:43.070 --> 03:42:43.080 align:start position:0%
does that not automatically kick in you
 
03:42:45.110 --> 03:42:45.120 align:start position:0%
have do you have to specify how this
 
03:42:45.120 --> 03:42:46.729 align:start position:0%
have do you have to specify how this
goes

03:42:46.729 --> 03:42:46.739 align:start position:0%
goes
 
03:42:49.309 --> 03:42:49.319 align:start position:0%
yeah so currently it's at the discretion
 
03:42:51.769 --> 03:42:51.779 align:start position:0%
of the school district
 
03:42:54.110 --> 03:42:54.120 align:start position:0%
um we did have in the original bill it
 
03:42:55.490 --> 03:42:55.500 align:start position:0%
said that they needed to provide
 
03:42:58.010 --> 03:42:58.020 align:start position:0%
something by January 1st of the school
 
03:42:58.020 --> 03:42:59.269 align:start position:0%
something by January 1st of the school
year

03:42:59.269 --> 03:42:59.279 align:start position:0%
year
 
03:42:59.279 --> 03:43:02.809 align:start position:0%
year
um however

03:43:02.809 --> 03:43:02.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:05.690 --> 03:43:05.700 align:start position:0%
it didn't say some some schools were
 
03:43:07.190 --> 03:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
taking this kind of wait and see
 
03:43:10.790 --> 03:43:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:13.130 --> 03:43:13.140 align:start position:0%
if they thought it was invalid re
 
03:43:16.790 --> 03:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
rescreening the child or
 
03:43:18.830 --> 03:43:18.840 align:start position:0%
if it was even more severe referring
 
03:43:20.630 --> 03:43:20.640 align:start position:0%
them to special education so that the
 
03:43:22.610 --> 03:43:22.620 align:start position:0%
point was not to make these kids wait
 
03:43:25.729 --> 03:43:25.739 align:start position:0%
all of this time to receive the help
 
03:43:28.670 --> 03:43:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:30.889 --> 03:43:30.899 align:start position:0%
I have a question for you is it wise to
 
03:43:33.290 --> 03:43:33.300 align:start position:0%
put like a 30 days and then what happens
 
03:43:35.750 --> 03:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
if it's just before Christmas break are
 
03:43:38.590 --> 03:43:38.600 align:start position:0%
these 30 school days are these 30 days
 
03:43:41.389 --> 03:43:41.399 align:start position:0%
calendar days uh
 
03:43:45.950 --> 03:43:45.960 align:start position:0%
hi you know is it wise to put a timeline
 
03:43:48.349 --> 03:43:48.359 align:start position:0%
like that due to the fact there are a
 
03:43:50.929 --> 03:43:50.939 align:start position:0%
number of variables in calendars from
 
03:43:53.269 --> 03:43:53.279 align:start position:0%
District to District
 
03:43:53.279 --> 03:43:55.309 align:start position:0%
District to District
so

03:43:55.309 --> 03:43:55.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:43:58.490 --> 03:43:58.500 align:start position:0%
even with school break with Christmas
 
03:44:01.250 --> 03:44:01.260 align:start position:0%
break kind of one of our longest breaks
 
03:44:05.690 --> 03:44:05.700 align:start position:0%
I believe that would still equate to
 
03:44:08.630 --> 03:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
allowing for our 15 plus school days for
 
03:44:14.870 --> 03:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:14.880 --> 03:44:16.910 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:44:16.910 --> 03:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:18.950 --> 03:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
I'd be okay changing it to a smaller
 
03:44:20.510 --> 03:44:20.520 align:start position:0%
number and saying school days but I
 
03:44:22.729 --> 03:44:22.739 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want it to necessarily be
 
03:44:24.950 --> 03:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
30 school days that's that's really a
 
03:44:26.990 --> 03:44:27.000 align:start position:0%
long period when there's only 180 days
 
03:44:30.050 --> 03:44:30.060 align:start position:0%
in the school year we're talking
 
03:44:30.060 --> 03:44:31.070 align:start position:0%
in the school year we're talking
um

03:44:31.070 --> 03:44:31.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:44:34.309 --> 03:44:34.319 align:start position:0%
that's 1 8 of the whole school year
 
03:44:35.809 --> 03:44:35.819 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for the question
 
03:44:38.510 --> 03:44:38.520 align:start position:0%
representative Cascade thank you Mr
 
03:44:41.150 --> 03:44:41.160 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for the bill I just
 
03:44:42.950 --> 03:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
questioned do you know that there are
 
03:44:44.389 --> 03:44:44.399 align:start position:0%
that many school districts without
 
03:44:46.790 --> 03:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
either a reading Specialist or Title One
 
03:44:49.370 --> 03:44:49.380 align:start position:0%
program that it warrants additional
 
03:44:52.550 --> 03:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
criteria for that to occur I mean my
 
03:44:52.560 --> 03:44:54.349 align:start position:0%
criteria for that to occur I mean my
experience

03:44:54.349 --> 03:44:54.359 align:start position:0%
experience
 
03:44:57.349 --> 03:44:57.359 align:start position:0%
is that it happens based on individual
 
03:45:01.849 --> 03:45:01.859 align:start position:0%
need not at any particular time
 
03:45:03.170 --> 03:45:03.180 align:start position:0%
um so are you thinking reading
 
03:45:06.050 --> 03:45:06.060 align:start position:0%
Specialists are not doing this or Title
 
03:45:07.790 --> 03:45:07.800 align:start position:0%
One programs are not addressing the
 
03:45:10.370 --> 03:45:10.380 align:start position:0%
needs of individual students or so not
 
03:45:12.410 --> 03:45:12.420 align:start position:0%
every district is doing this no and
 
03:45:14.090 --> 03:45:14.100 align:start position:0%
sometimes what will happen is as a kiddo
 
03:45:15.769 --> 03:45:15.779 align:start position:0%
will get intervention in kindergarten
 
03:45:17.570 --> 03:45:17.580 align:start position:0%
and then they'll catch up back to grade
 
03:45:20.269 --> 03:45:20.279 align:start position:0%
level they'll stop receiving services or
 
03:45:22.729 --> 03:45:22.739 align:start position:0%
intervention and then
 
03:45:24.830 --> 03:45:24.840 align:start position:0%
they're behind Again by the end of first
 
03:45:26.690 --> 03:45:26.700 align:start position:0%
grade and we're not catching it because
 
03:45:29.750 --> 03:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
we're not re-screening them
 
03:45:33.110 --> 03:45:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:35.630 --> 03:45:35.640 align:start position:0%
yes represent McDonald thank you Mr
 
03:45:37.309 --> 03:45:37.319 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking the
 
03:45:40.250 --> 03:45:40.260 align:start position:0%
question this says it's for dyslexia and
 
03:45:42.290 --> 03:45:42.300 align:start position:0%
Related Disorders could you touch on
 
03:45:44.990 --> 03:45:45.000 align:start position:0%
what those Related Disorders include
 
03:45:46.910 --> 03:45:46.920 align:start position:0%
so I could also be things like
 
03:45:46.920 --> 03:45:49.010 align:start position:0%
so I could also be things like
dysgraphia

03:45:49.010 --> 03:45:49.020 align:start position:0%
dysgraphia
 
03:45:49.020 --> 03:45:51.950 align:start position:0%
dysgraphia
um

03:45:51.950 --> 03:45:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:54.170 --> 03:45:54.180 align:start position:0%
I think representative ball may be able
 
03:45:55.910 --> 03:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
to elaborate more on some of the other
 
03:45:58.010 --> 03:45:58.020 align:start position:0%
disorders because
 
03:45:59.570 --> 03:45:59.580 align:start position:0%
I don't know that I know all of them
 
03:46:01.370 --> 03:46:01.380 align:start position:0%
offhand she probably knows the entire
 
03:46:03.469 --> 03:46:03.479 align:start position:0%
list off the top of her head I can only
 
03:46:06.229 --> 03:46:06.239 align:start position:0%
think of dysgraphia as a second one all
 
03:46:08.150 --> 03:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
right well thank you further questions
 
03:46:10.790 --> 03:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
representative Damon
 
03:46:12.950 --> 03:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
03:46:14.690 --> 03:46:14.700 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
03:46:14.700 --> 03:46:15.650 align:start position:0%
this bill
um

03:46:15.650 --> 03:46:15.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:46:19.490 --> 03:46:19.500 align:start position:0%
we had some constituent email I'm not
 
03:46:21.110 --> 03:46:21.120 align:start position:0%
sure if the person who sent it might be
 
03:46:23.530 --> 03:46:23.540 align:start position:0%
testifying but it was an inquiry about
 
03:46:26.570 --> 03:46:26.580 align:start position:0%
adding hearing screening because of the
 
03:46:30.670 --> 03:46:30.680 align:start position:0%
correlation between hearing deficit and
 
03:46:32.809 --> 03:46:32.819 align:start position:0%
misdiagnosis of Dyslexia and I just
 
03:46:34.250 --> 03:46:34.260 align:start position:0%
wondered if that had been entertained at
 
03:46:35.870 --> 03:46:35.880 align:start position:0%
all or if you could speak to that or
 
03:46:37.729 --> 03:46:37.739 align:start position:0%
someone else who's testifying
 
03:46:42.889 --> 03:46:42.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:45.650 --> 03:46:45.660 align:start position:0%
hearing screening is provided currently
 
03:46:47.510 --> 03:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
as a newborn and then it's also provided
 
03:46:50.330 --> 03:46:50.340 align:start position:0%
at the 2 4
 
03:46:53.809 --> 03:46:53.819 align:start position:0%
5 6 and 7 well visits I believe and so
 
03:46:55.849 --> 03:46:55.859 align:start position:0%
these are they're being provided as part
 
03:46:58.370 --> 03:46:58.380 align:start position:0%
of the the children's pediatric visits
 
03:47:01.130 --> 03:47:01.140 align:start position:0%
and so implementing that in school may
 
03:47:02.870 --> 03:47:02.880 align:start position:0%
be a little bit redundant and I'm also a
 
03:47:04.729 --> 03:47:04.739 align:start position:0%
little bit hesitant that
 
03:47:07.550 --> 03:47:07.560 align:start position:0%
if a child is at all anxious or they're
 
03:47:09.110 --> 03:47:09.120 align:start position:0%
around other kids who are also talking
 
03:47:11.090 --> 03:47:11.100 align:start position:0%
and it may not be perfectly quiet they
 
03:47:13.130 --> 03:47:13.140 align:start position:0%
may be getting flagged on a screening
 
03:47:16.010 --> 03:47:16.020 align:start position:0%
like that unnecessarily typically if
 
03:47:17.870 --> 03:47:17.880 align:start position:0%
this is alerted as a special ed case
 
03:47:19.269 --> 03:47:19.279 align:start position:0%
then they would
 
03:47:22.309 --> 03:47:22.319 align:start position:0%
get the screening for that but just in
 
03:47:25.610 --> 03:47:25.620 align:start position:0%
terms of the general population doing it
 
03:47:27.229 --> 03:47:27.239 align:start position:0%
I think it would be a bit repetitive
 
03:47:29.570 --> 03:47:29.580 align:start position:0%
plus costly I think the cost of the
 
03:47:31.670 --> 03:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
machines is roughly
 
03:47:34.010 --> 03:47:34.020 align:start position:0%
two to three thousand plus the training
 
03:47:37.490 --> 03:47:37.500 align:start position:0%
of the nurses on how to use them
 
03:47:38.690 --> 03:47:38.700 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:47:40.729 --> 03:47:40.739 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
03:47:42.590 --> 03:47:42.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
03:47:44.750 --> 03:47:44.760 align:start position:0%
I'd like to invite uh Karen Abel
 
03:47:47.510 --> 03:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
representative evil up
 
03:47:52.070 --> 03:47:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:52.080 --> 03:47:54.550 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:47:54.550 --> 03:47:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:58.190 --> 03:47:58.200 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Karen Ebel I
 
03:48:02.210 --> 03:48:02.220 align:start position:0%
represent Merrimack District 7 which is
 
03:48:05.330 --> 03:48:05.340 align:start position:0%
New London and Newbury I'm I'm here
 
03:48:08.570 --> 03:48:08.580 align:start position:0%
primarily to provide some historical
 
03:48:13.370 --> 03:48:13.380 align:start position:0%
context for the dyslexia bill
 
03:48:16.490 --> 03:48:16.500 align:start position:0%
um back in 2015 my district made
 
03:48:19.309 --> 03:48:19.319 align:start position:0%
representative David Kidder introduced a
 
03:48:22.070 --> 03:48:22.080 align:start position:0%
bill to create a legislative excuse me
 
03:48:24.110 --> 03:48:24.120 align:start position:0%
study committee to look into dyslexia
 
03:48:26.450 --> 03:48:26.460 align:start position:0%
education at the behest of our
 
03:48:28.849 --> 03:48:28.859 align:start position:0%
constituent BB Casey who will testify
 
03:48:32.389 --> 03:48:32.399 align:start position:0%
later I was very eager to co-sponsor it
 
03:48:35.389 --> 03:48:35.399 align:start position:0%
this issue is personal to me my sister
 
03:48:37.790 --> 03:48:37.800 align:start position:0%
is dyslexic and wasn't diagnosed until
 
03:48:40.490 --> 03:48:40.500 align:start position:0%
she was a junior in high school her son
 
03:48:43.969 --> 03:48:43.979 align:start position:0%
my nephew has dyslexia and received very
 
03:48:46.250 --> 03:48:46.260 align:start position:0%
little support in school now his
 
03:48:49.070 --> 03:48:49.080 align:start position:0%
daughter is facing the same issue having
 
03:48:52.309 --> 03:48:52.319 align:start position:0%
dyslexia presents extreme problems for
 
03:48:56.150 --> 03:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
those who don't have the proper support
 
03:48:58.429 --> 03:48:58.439 align:start position:0%
there's no question that dyslexia can
 
03:49:00.650 --> 03:49:00.660 align:start position:0%
present challenges for a child and their
 
03:49:02.990 --> 03:49:03.000 align:start position:0%
family but these challenges shouldn't go
 
03:49:06.950 --> 03:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
on for decades fortunately in 2016 the
 
03:49:08.630 --> 03:49:08.640 align:start position:0%
legislature with the support of this
 
03:49:10.910 --> 03:49:10.920 align:start position:0%
committee passed a law to improve
 
03:49:13.190 --> 03:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
dyslexia education and support early
 
03:49:15.590 --> 03:49:15.600 align:start position:0%
intervention for reading challenges
 
03:49:15.600 --> 03:49:17.030 align:start position:0%
intervention for reading challenges
generally

03:49:17.030 --> 03:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
generally
 
03:49:19.790 --> 03:49:19.800 align:start position:0%
the 2015 study committee of which
 
03:49:21.830 --> 03:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli was a member
 
03:49:24.889 --> 03:49:24.899 align:start position:0%
revealed how much lacking was lacking in
 
03:49:26.870 --> 03:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
educational opportunities for students
 
03:49:28.510 --> 03:49:28.520 align:start position:0%
with dyslexia
 
03:49:31.309 --> 03:49:31.319 align:start position:0%
dysgraphia and dyscalculia which I
 
03:49:34.510 --> 03:49:34.520 align:start position:0%
learned how to say during the process
 
03:49:37.309 --> 03:49:37.319 align:start position:0%
and how much they suffered personally
 
03:49:39.110 --> 03:49:39.120 align:start position:0%
and professionally because their
 
03:49:40.910 --> 03:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
condition was missed
 
03:49:43.210 --> 03:49:43.220 align:start position:0%
we learned that with early intervention
 
03:49:46.610 --> 03:49:46.620 align:start position:0%
based initially on simple free screening
 
03:49:48.769 --> 03:49:48.779 align:start position:0%
tools children with potential problems
 
03:49:50.990 --> 03:49:51.000 align:start position:0%
could be helped and their chances at
 
03:49:53.389 --> 03:49:53.399 align:start position:0%
success grew exponentially
 
03:49:55.309 --> 03:49:55.319 align:start position:0%
with early intervention and
 
03:49:57.889 --> 03:49:57.899 align:start position:0%
evidence-based prac best practices many
 
03:50:00.950 --> 03:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
children could even avoid IEPs
 
03:50:03.650 --> 03:50:03.660 align:start position:0%
school districts should be able to save
 
03:50:05.990 --> 03:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
precious dollars in the long run with
 
03:50:08.450 --> 03:50:08.460 align:start position:0%
proper early intervention and
 
03:50:10.969 --> 03:50:10.979 align:start position:0%
Educational Tools and children will
 
03:50:10.979 --> 03:50:12.110 align:start position:0%
Educational Tools and children will
thrive

03:50:12.110 --> 03:50:12.120 align:start position:0%
thrive
 
03:50:14.990 --> 03:50:15.000 align:start position:0%
we were surprised to learn that indicia
 
03:50:18.110 --> 03:50:18.120 align:start position:0%
of Dyslexia were not taught in teaching
 
03:50:21.349 --> 03:50:21.359 align:start position:0%
colleges so our T many teachers at that
 
03:50:23.870 --> 03:50:23.880 align:start position:0%
time were not trained to recognize them
 
03:50:26.570 --> 03:50:26.580 align:start position:0%
we decided schools would benefit greatly
 
03:50:28.729 --> 03:50:28.739 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Education reading
 
03:50:31.070 --> 03:50:31.080 align:start position:0%
special specialist as a source of
 
03:50:33.490 --> 03:50:33.500 align:start position:0%
information for dyslexia information
 
03:50:36.229 --> 03:50:36.239 align:start position:0%
intervention and support
 
03:50:38.870 --> 03:50:38.880 align:start position:0%
reading as you all well know is the
 
03:50:40.729 --> 03:50:40.739 align:start position:0%
Cornerstone of all learning
 
03:50:43.070 --> 03:50:43.080 align:start position:0%
and is critical for career Readiness of
 
03:50:46.610 --> 03:50:46.620 align:start position:0%
any type and for college being able to
 
03:50:48.950 --> 03:50:48.960 align:start position:0%
read is the key to the kingdom as your
 
03:50:52.070 --> 03:50:52.080 align:start position:0%
committee knows well dyslexia is the
 
03:50:54.650 --> 03:50:54.660 align:start position:0%
most common type of learning disability
 
03:50:57.290 --> 03:50:57.300 align:start position:0%
I haven't looked at recent statistics
 
03:50:59.630 --> 03:50:59.640 align:start position:0%
but at the time of our study 10 to 15
 
03:51:02.030 --> 03:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
percent of our population had some form
 
03:51:05.090 --> 03:51:05.100 align:start position:0%
of Dyslexia including at that time it
 
03:51:06.889 --> 03:51:06.899 align:start position:0%
was twelve thousand students I believe
 
03:51:09.170 --> 03:51:09.180 align:start position:0%
representative kutab just said ten
 
03:51:11.750 --> 03:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
thousand perhaps some of you your family
 
03:51:14.210 --> 03:51:14.220 align:start position:0%
and friends and that is a really huge
 
03:51:15.530 --> 03:51:15.540 align:start position:0%
number of people
 
03:51:18.229 --> 03:51:18.239 align:start position:0%
it was a happy day in 2016 when the
 
03:51:20.330 --> 03:51:20.340 align:start position:0%
resulting legislation to support our
 
03:51:22.610 --> 03:51:22.620 align:start position:0%
children and our schools past putting
 
03:51:24.349 --> 03:51:24.359 align:start position:0%
into place the statute that we're
 
03:51:26.929 --> 03:51:26.939 align:start position:0%
recommending be amended today the
 
03:51:29.750 --> 03:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
program has been successful but like
 
03:51:32.630 --> 03:51:32.640 align:start position:0%
anything some deficiencies have been
 
03:51:35.450 --> 03:51:35.460 align:start position:0%
identified I'm regret I'm grateful to
 
03:51:39.110 --> 03:51:39.120 align:start position:0%
representative kutab for bringing HB 377
 
03:51:41.510 --> 03:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
which seeks to improve New Hampshire's
 
03:51:44.389 --> 03:51:44.399 align:start position:0%
dyslexia education program focusing
 
03:51:46.429 --> 03:51:46.439 align:start position:0%
primarily on increased screening and
 
03:51:49.250 --> 03:51:49.260 align:start position:0%
prompt appropriate follow-up these
 
03:51:50.809 --> 03:51:50.819 align:start position:0%
simple tools applied early and
 
03:51:53.330 --> 03:51:53.340 align:start position:0%
frequently can help our children to
 
03:51:53.340 --> 03:51:54.349 align:start position:0%
frequently can help our children to
thrive

03:51:54.349 --> 03:51:54.359 align:start position:0%
thrive
 
03:51:57.710 --> 03:51:57.720 align:start position:0%
I am truly humbled to be before this
 
03:51:59.690 --> 03:51:59.700 align:start position:0%
committee today knowing how much you
 
03:52:02.330 --> 03:52:02.340 align:start position:0%
have to do and how much important work
 
03:52:04.910 --> 03:52:04.920 align:start position:0%
you have done in the past and I really
 
03:52:07.490 --> 03:52:07.500 align:start position:0%
don't have the expertise that you have
 
03:52:10.190 --> 03:52:10.200 align:start position:0%
in the field of education and would ask
 
03:52:12.349 --> 03:52:12.359 align:start position:0%
that any specific questions be addressed
 
03:52:14.990 --> 03:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
to The Experts here today much of the
 
03:52:17.269 --> 03:52:17.279 align:start position:0%
work you do is profoundly challenging
 
03:52:20.030 --> 03:52:20.040 align:start position:0%
and I do thank you for what you do this
 
03:52:22.910 --> 03:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
is an improvement to a very good law and
 
03:52:25.190 --> 03:52:25.200 align:start position:0%
I hope it presents a simple decision for
 
03:52:28.190 --> 03:52:28.200 align:start position:0%
you more screening is good our children
 
03:52:30.590 --> 03:52:30.600 align:start position:0%
our school districts our communities and
 
03:52:32.809 --> 03:52:32.819 align:start position:0%
our state will all benefit by helping
 
03:52:35.570 --> 03:52:35.580 align:start position:0%
these children to thrive this is a goal
 
03:52:38.389 --> 03:52:38.399 align:start position:0%
we all share and I urge you to recommend
 
03:52:42.349 --> 03:52:42.359 align:start position:0%
passage of HB 377 and thank you for your
 
03:52:44.269 --> 03:52:44.279 align:start position:0%
previous support of children with
 
03:52:45.950 --> 03:52:45.960 align:start position:0%
dyslexia and their family thank you very
 
03:52:47.750 --> 03:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
much representable I can remember when
 
03:52:50.030 --> 03:52:50.040 align:start position:0%
Jack Falcon was sitting right beside me
 
03:52:51.290 --> 03:52:51.300 align:start position:0%
here as Vice chair of this committee
 
03:52:53.690 --> 03:52:53.700 align:start position:0%
when we did this yeah initially it's
 
03:52:57.950 --> 03:52:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:00.590 --> 03:53:00.600 align:start position:0%
or are you off the hook I am and I
 
03:53:02.630 --> 03:53:02.640 align:start position:0%
apologize I have to go to another thank
 
03:53:06.650 --> 03:53:06.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:08.990 --> 03:53:09.000 align:start position:0%
next uh individual is representative
 
03:53:23.990 --> 03:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:26.570 --> 03:53:26.580 align:start position:0%
welcome hi good afternoon thank you for
 
03:53:28.550 --> 03:53:28.560 align:start position:0%
allowing me to testify I appreciate the
 
03:53:28.560 --> 03:53:30.170 align:start position:0%
allowing me to testify I appreciate the
time

03:53:30.170 --> 03:53:30.180 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:53:30.180 --> 03:53:31.910 align:start position:0%
time
laughs

03:53:31.910 --> 03:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
laughs
 
03:53:34.370 --> 03:53:34.380 align:start position:0%
I do have written testimony that I will
 
03:53:37.190 --> 03:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:39.050 --> 03:53:39.060 align:start position:0%
there's no doubt that early intervention
 
03:53:41.630 --> 03:53:41.640 align:start position:0%
is crucial to a child's educational
 
03:53:44.090 --> 03:53:44.100 align:start position:0%
development that's why we have child
 
03:53:46.429 --> 03:53:46.439 align:start position:0%
find at age two and a half research
 
03:53:48.830 --> 03:53:48.840 align:start position:0%
research shows that many Educators and
 
03:53:51.050 --> 03:53:51.060 align:start position:0%
medical professionals can spot learning
 
03:53:52.969 --> 03:53:52.979 align:start position:0%
disabilities far earlier than previously
 
03:53:55.010 --> 03:53:55.020 align:start position:0%
thought as a reading and writing
 
03:53:57.050 --> 03:53:57.060 align:start position:0%
specialist with an emphasis in dyslexia
 
03:53:59.030 --> 03:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
I am well versed at spotting students
 
03:54:00.410 --> 03:54:00.420 align:start position:0%
who are not processing information
 
03:54:03.229 --> 03:54:03.239 align:start position:0%
correctly during covet
 
03:54:05.150 --> 03:54:05.160 align:start position:0%
while doing remote learning with a child
 
03:54:07.250 --> 03:54:07.260 align:start position:0%
who was in kindergarten it only took me
 
03:54:08.990 --> 03:54:09.000 align:start position:0%
10 minutes to say that he was not
 
03:54:10.910 --> 03:54:10.920 align:start position:0%
processing information correctly in
 
03:54:13.910 --> 03:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
reading and math yet it took a year for
 
03:54:15.830 --> 03:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
the school to identify that child for
 
03:54:18.290 --> 03:54:18.300 align:start position:0%
reading intervention and two years to
 
03:54:20.809 --> 03:54:20.819 align:start position:0%
refer that child to special education
 
03:54:23.210 --> 03:54:23.220 align:start position:0%
my experience as an educational advocate
 
03:54:25.370 --> 03:54:25.380 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire has shown me that this
 
03:54:29.689 --> 03:54:29.699 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:31.429 --> 03:54:31.439 align:start position:0%
I do not find fault with the general
 
03:54:33.229 --> 03:54:33.239 align:start position:0%
education teachers who have not been
 
03:54:34.790 --> 03:54:34.800 align:start position:0%
trained to recognize the signs of
 
03:54:37.130 --> 03:54:37.140 align:start position:0%
dyslexia and I understand why some
 
03:54:39.769 --> 03:54:39.779 align:start position:0%
teachers even when they know that there
 
03:54:42.530 --> 03:54:42.540 align:start position:0%
is possibly a problem may be reluctant
 
03:54:46.130 --> 03:54:46.140 align:start position:0%
to to refer that child for intervention
 
03:54:48.050 --> 03:54:48.060 align:start position:0%
that's because I know that there are
 
03:54:49.429 --> 03:54:49.439 align:start position:0%
some things that are beyond the general
 
03:54:52.370 --> 03:54:52.380 align:start position:0%
education teachers control
 
03:54:54.170 --> 03:54:54.180 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire many school districts
 
03:54:56.510 --> 03:54:56.520 align:start position:0%
follow an Unwritten rule of thumb
 
03:54:58.610 --> 03:54:58.620 align:start position:0%
students must be one year behind grade
 
03:55:00.650 --> 03:55:00.660 align:start position:0%
level to be referred for special for
 
03:55:03.410 --> 03:55:03.420 align:start position:0%
intervention and two years behind grade
 
03:55:05.210 --> 03:55:05.220 align:start position:0%
level to be referred to special
 
03:55:05.220 --> 03:55:06.710 align:start position:0%
level to be referred to special
education

03:55:06.710 --> 03:55:06.720 align:start position:0%
education
 
03:55:09.110 --> 03:55:09.120 align:start position:0%
although that may sound shocking this
 
03:55:10.729 --> 03:55:10.739 align:start position:0%
happens because the New Hampshire rules
 
03:55:12.590 --> 03:55:12.600 align:start position:0%
of Education of the children with
 
03:55:15.769 --> 03:55:15.779 align:start position:0%
disabilities provides that option
 
03:55:19.610 --> 03:55:19.620 align:start position:0%
for the IEP team to deny evaluating
 
03:55:22.610 --> 03:55:22.620 align:start position:0%
a student until they quote determine
 
03:55:24.889 --> 03:55:24.899 align:start position:0%
whether the concerns raised by the
 
03:55:26.929 --> 03:55:26.939 align:start position:0%
referral can be addressed utilizing
 
03:55:28.969 --> 03:55:28.979 align:start position:0%
existing pupil service supports
 
03:55:32.389 --> 03:55:32.399 align:start position:0%
available to all children in the school
 
03:55:35.450 --> 03:55:35.460 align:start position:0%
this caveat is why it is imperative that
 
03:55:37.670 --> 03:55:37.680 align:start position:0%
we move forward with the amendment to HB
 
03:55:37.680 --> 03:55:39.110 align:start position:0%
we move forward with the amendment to HB
377

03:55:39.110 --> 03:55:39.120 align:start position:0%
377
 
03:55:41.269 --> 03:55:41.279 align:start position:0%
to utilize evidence-based screening to
 
03:55:43.130 --> 03:55:43.140 align:start position:0%
quickly identify students who need
 
03:55:45.349 --> 03:55:45.359 align:start position:0%
intervention and or specialized
 
03:55:45.359 --> 03:55:46.670 align:start position:0%
intervention and or specialized
instruction

03:55:46.670 --> 03:55:46.680 align:start position:0%
instruction
 
03:55:49.070 --> 03:55:49.080 align:start position:0%
this house bill Amendment will assure
 
03:55:51.469 --> 03:55:51.479 align:start position:0%
that students do not fall so far behind
 
03:55:53.689 --> 03:55:53.699 align:start position:0%
that they will never catch up to their
 
03:55:55.790 --> 03:55:55.800 align:start position:0%
same grade level peers
 
03:55:57.710 --> 03:55:57.720 align:start position:0%
in addition it helps to assure that
 
03:55:57.720 --> 03:55:58.849 align:start position:0%
in addition it helps to assure that
students

03:55:58.849 --> 03:55:58.859 align:start position:0%
students
 
03:56:01.250 --> 03:56:01.260 align:start position:0%
will not be caught in a situation where
 
03:56:02.929 --> 03:56:02.939 align:start position:0%
they are still trying to learn to read
 
03:56:06.290 --> 03:56:06.300 align:start position:0%
While others are reading to learn
 
03:56:08.389 --> 03:56:08.399 align:start position:0%
at this point you might be asking
 
03:56:10.670 --> 03:56:10.680 align:start position:0%
yourself well this amendment really make
 
03:56:13.070 --> 03:56:13.080 align:start position:0%
a difference well let me tell you about
 
03:56:15.469 --> 03:56:15.479 align:start position:0%
children with dyslexia children with
 
03:56:18.050 --> 03:56:18.060 align:start position:0%
dyslexia typically have average to above
 
03:56:20.570 --> 03:56:20.580 align:start position:0%
average IQs as I would tell many of the
 
03:56:23.450 --> 03:56:23.460 align:start position:0%
students I worked with Albert Einstein
 
03:56:25.130 --> 03:56:25.140 align:start position:0%
was dyslexic
 
03:56:27.410 --> 03:56:27.420 align:start position:0%
students with dyslexia quickly teach
 
03:56:29.630 --> 03:56:29.640 align:start position:0%
themselves compensating strategies to
 
03:56:31.610 --> 03:56:31.620 align:start position:0%
keep up with their classmates they
 
03:56:34.189 --> 03:56:34.199 align:start position:0%
follow along listen and memorize words
 
03:56:36.469 --> 03:56:36.479 align:start position:0%
as they see and hear them
 
03:56:38.630 --> 03:56:38.640 align:start position:0%
students with dyslexia can fly under
 
03:56:41.870 --> 03:56:41.880 align:start position:0%
their teacher's radar for years
 
03:56:43.849 --> 03:56:43.859 align:start position:0%
this is an example of my personal
 
03:56:43.859 --> 03:56:46.070 align:start position:0%
this is an example of my personal
experiences

03:56:46.070 --> 03:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
experiences
 
03:56:48.950 --> 03:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
one student an 11th grade student who
 
03:56:51.229 --> 03:56:51.239 align:start position:0%
started having difficulty keeping up was
 
03:56:54.889 --> 03:56:54.899 align:start position:0%
found to have a grade 2 reading level
 
03:56:56.870 --> 03:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
the psychologists who tested that
 
03:56:58.610 --> 03:56:58.620 align:start position:0%
student commented that he was surprised
 
03:57:00.170 --> 03:57:00.180 align:start position:0%
he did not become a discipline problem
 
03:57:02.689 --> 03:57:02.699 align:start position:0%
or drop out of school
 
03:57:05.030 --> 03:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
an eighth grade student I worked with
 
03:57:10.070 --> 03:57:10.080 align:start position:0%
had an IQ of 115. she was referred
 
03:57:12.290 --> 03:57:12.300 align:start position:0%
she started coming to school every day
 
03:57:12.300 --> 03:57:13.790 align:start position:0%
she started coming to school every day
late

03:57:13.790 --> 03:57:13.800 align:start position:0%
late
 
03:57:17.210 --> 03:57:17.220 align:start position:0%
she was referred to be identified as a
 
03:57:21.110 --> 03:57:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:22.670 --> 03:57:22.680 align:start position:0%
I don't know if I mentioned but in
 
03:57:24.530 --> 03:57:24.540 align:start position:0%
addition to being a reading specialist
 
03:57:25.969 --> 03:57:25.979 align:start position:0%
I'm also an emotional behavioral
 
03:57:28.849 --> 03:57:28.859 align:start position:0%
specialist so I was at the IEP team at
 
03:57:31.010 --> 03:57:31.020 align:start position:0%
the IEP meeting
 
03:57:33.769 --> 03:57:33.779 align:start position:0%
in order to identify her except that I
 
03:57:35.030 --> 03:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
quickly realized that she was
 
03:57:36.710 --> 03:57:36.720 align:start position:0%
deliberately missing language arts and
 
03:57:39.349 --> 03:57:39.359 align:start position:0%
social studies I suggested that we rule
 
03:57:41.150 --> 03:57:41.160 align:start position:0%
out a reading disability everyone
 
03:57:42.769 --> 03:57:42.779 align:start position:0%
thought I was crazy
 
03:57:44.630 --> 03:57:44.640 align:start position:0%
but they let me do it
 
03:57:46.550 --> 03:57:46.560 align:start position:0%
she could not read
 
03:57:48.410 --> 03:57:48.420 align:start position:0%
she figured out how to read along by
 
03:57:50.269 --> 03:57:50.279 align:start position:0%
memorizing your words and when she was
 
03:57:51.889 --> 03:57:51.899 align:start position:0%
seeing them and hearing them just like I
 
03:57:53.510 --> 03:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned it before
 
03:57:55.189 --> 03:57:55.199 align:start position:0%
we've gotten all the way to letter J
 
03:57:57.469 --> 03:57:57.479 align:start position:0%
when I said to her how do you know that
 
03:57:58.670 --> 03:57:58.680 align:start position:0%
says Jay
 
03:58:00.950 --> 03:58:00.960 align:start position:0%
and just to back up a little bit the
 
03:58:02.750 --> 03:58:02.760 align:start position:0%
expectation is that a student should be
 
03:58:05.510 --> 03:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
able to identify a letter or a word
 
03:58:08.990 --> 03:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
within three seconds so as I'm sure all
 
03:58:10.610 --> 03:58:10.620 align:start position:0%
of you sitting here can probably just do
 
03:58:14.630 --> 03:58:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:16.490 --> 03:58:16.500 align:start position:0%
um but she was taking too long we got to
 
03:58:18.170 --> 03:58:18.180 align:start position:0%
the letter J and I said how did you know
 
03:58:19.969 --> 03:58:19.979 align:start position:0%
that that said you
 
03:58:22.010 --> 03:58:22.020 align:start position:0%
and she said because I know that jump
 
03:58:24.710 --> 03:58:24.720 align:start position:0%
starts with j and I backed out all the
 
03:58:27.349 --> 03:58:27.359 align:start position:0%
other sounds and I figured it out that's
 
03:58:30.229 --> 03:58:30.239 align:start position:0%
how much is going on in their heads
 
03:58:32.750 --> 03:58:32.760 align:start position:0%
constantly to learn to read or just to
 
03:58:34.130 --> 03:58:34.140 align:start position:0%
be able to look like they know how to
 
03:58:34.140 --> 03:58:36.170 align:start position:0%
be able to look like they know how to
read

03:58:36.170 --> 03:58:36.180 align:start position:0%
read
 
03:58:37.790 --> 03:58:37.800 align:start position:0%
as it turns out
 
03:58:40.309 --> 03:58:40.319 align:start position:0%
I am now hearing that the district is
 
03:58:42.170 --> 03:58:42.180 align:start position:0%
now ruling out dyslexia
 
03:58:44.330 --> 03:58:44.340 align:start position:0%
before identifying any students with an
 
03:58:46.130 --> 03:58:46.140 align:start position:0%
emotional disability
 
03:58:47.990 --> 03:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
my experience working with children with
 
03:58:50.389 --> 03:58:50.399 align:start position:0%
emotional disabilities is that when I
 
03:58:52.189 --> 03:58:52.199 align:start position:0%
started to peel the onion back I would
 
03:58:53.990 --> 03:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
say eight out of the ten children that I
 
03:58:55.610 --> 03:58:55.620 align:start position:0%
worked with I found the reading
 
03:58:55.620 --> 03:58:57.410 align:start position:0%
worked with I found the reading
disability

03:58:57.410 --> 03:58:57.420 align:start position:0%
disability
 
03:58:59.870 --> 03:58:59.880 align:start position:0%
they were not mostly Disturbed
 
03:59:02.689 --> 03:59:02.699 align:start position:0%
they were frustrated
 
03:59:04.550 --> 03:59:04.560 align:start position:0%
the impact of failing to catch students
 
03:59:05.990 --> 03:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
who are struggling to learn to read
 
03:59:08.809 --> 03:59:08.819 align:start position:0%
early in their educational career
 
03:59:10.729 --> 03:59:10.739 align:start position:0%
can mean years if not a lifetime
 
03:59:12.889 --> 03:59:12.899 align:start position:0%
irreparable harm
 
03:59:15.349 --> 03:59:15.359 align:start position:0%
academically socially emotionally and
 
03:59:15.359 --> 03:59:16.550 align:start position:0%
academically socially emotionally and
economically

03:59:16.550 --> 03:59:16.560 align:start position:0%
economically
 
03:59:19.250 --> 03:59:19.260 align:start position:0%
is that an overestimate no
 
03:59:21.469 --> 03:59:21.479 align:start position:0%
our society continues to measure
 
03:59:24.290 --> 03:59:24.300 align:start position:0%
intelligence by fluency
 
03:59:26.750 --> 03:59:26.760 align:start position:0%
in schools that means how fast does a
 
03:59:28.849 --> 03:59:28.859 align:start position:0%
child read how fast can they do math
 
03:59:31.370 --> 03:59:31.380 align:start position:0%
problems as I pointed out last week the
 
03:59:33.650 --> 03:59:33.660 align:start position:0%
academic evaluations used to identify
 
03:59:36.469 --> 03:59:36.479 align:start position:0%
children for special education include
 
03:59:38.450 --> 03:59:38.460 align:start position:0%
components that measure students fluency
 
03:59:41.389 --> 03:59:41.399 align:start position:0%
in writing and math those same
 
03:59:45.349 --> 03:59:45.359 align:start position:0%
evaluations measure reading fluency
 
03:59:47.630 --> 03:59:47.640 align:start position:0%
students including young students know
 
03:59:49.610 --> 03:59:49.620 align:start position:0%
when they are not measuring up to their
 
03:59:51.650 --> 03:59:51.660 align:start position:0%
same grade peers those struggling
 
03:59:51.660 --> 03:59:52.849 align:start position:0%
same grade peers those struggling
students

03:59:52.849 --> 03:59:52.859 align:start position:0%
students
 
03:59:54.950 --> 03:59:54.960 align:start position:0%
are those struggling with reading often
 
03:59:57.229 --> 03:59:57.239 align:start position:0%
feel inferior to their peers which
 
03:59:59.689 --> 03:59:59.699 align:start position:0%
causes their self-esteem to erode
 
04:00:01.790 --> 04:00:01.800 align:start position:0%
this opens the door for a host of social
 
04:00:04.729 --> 04:00:04.739 align:start position:0%
emotional factors as many of my students
 
04:00:07.010 --> 04:00:07.020 align:start position:0%
have told me I would much rather be seen
 
04:00:11.030 --> 04:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:14.630 --> 04:00:14.640 align:start position:0%
the vet is far too many students never
 
04:00:17.330 --> 04:00:17.340 align:start position:0%
get identified
 
04:00:20.150 --> 04:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
as evident when you look at the
 
04:00:22.670 --> 04:00:22.680 align:start position:0%
graph that I give you
 
04:00:24.590 --> 04:00:24.600 align:start position:0%
okay until later on in their school
 
04:00:27.050 --> 04:00:27.060 align:start position:0%
years often they're 10 11 12 years old
 
04:00:28.849 --> 04:00:28.859 align:start position:0%
when they're being identified with a
 
04:00:30.889 --> 04:00:30.899 align:start position:0%
specific learning disability
 
04:00:33.050 --> 04:00:33.060 align:start position:0%
last year our education commissioner
 
04:00:35.929 --> 04:00:35.939 align:start position:0%
Frank edelblue said that 42 000 New
 
04:00:37.550 --> 04:00:37.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire students were not reading a
 
04:00:40.070 --> 04:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
proficient great at proficient levels
 
04:00:42.110 --> 04:00:42.120 align:start position:0%
this is far more students than we have
 
04:00:44.389 --> 04:00:44.399 align:start position:0%
identified for special education
 
04:00:46.429 --> 04:00:46.439 align:start position:0%
so that means there's many out there
 
04:00:49.189 --> 04:00:49.199 align:start position:0%
still languishing and not getting the
 
04:00:54.290 --> 04:00:54.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:56.630 --> 04:00:56.640 align:start position:0%
as part of what I brought is the same
 
04:00:58.910 --> 04:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
chart last year but they put out a new
 
04:01:01.969 --> 04:01:01.979 align:start position:0%
one so this is updated to 2022 instead
 
04:01:04.429 --> 04:01:04.439 align:start position:0%
of the 21. if you look at the
 
04:01:06.290 --> 04:01:06.300 align:start position:0%
disbursement of the 10
 
04:01:08.689 --> 04:01:08.699 align:start position:0%
000 77 students identified for special
 
04:01:11.389 --> 04:01:11.399 align:start position:0%
for specific learning disabilities which
 
04:01:13.910 --> 04:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
as we know is basic literacy skills you
 
04:01:15.410 --> 04:01:15.420 align:start position:0%
can see that students are still being
 
04:01:18.170 --> 04:01:18.180 align:start position:0%
identified sld in Upper Elementary and
 
04:01:20.450 --> 04:01:20.460 align:start position:0%
Middle School ages that's because they
 
04:01:22.370 --> 04:01:22.380 align:start position:0%
were able to fly under the radar until
 
04:01:24.349 --> 04:01:24.359 align:start position:0%
they had multi-syllabic words and could
 
04:01:26.150 --> 04:01:26.160 align:start position:0%
no longer memorize
 
04:01:28.610 --> 04:01:28.620 align:start position:0%
their compensating strategies no longer
 
04:01:28.620 --> 04:01:30.170 align:start position:0%
their compensating strategies no longer
worked

04:01:30.170 --> 04:01:30.180 align:start position:0%
worked
 
04:01:32.630 --> 04:01:32.640 align:start position:0%
knowing that quality intervention takes
 
04:01:34.550 --> 04:01:34.560 align:start position:0%
typically two to two and a half years to
 
04:01:36.530 --> 04:01:36.540 align:start position:0%
implement with Fidelity many of these
 
04:01:38.570 --> 04:01:38.580 align:start position:0%
students would have already completed
 
04:01:41.570 --> 04:01:41.580 align:start position:0%
the Intervention Program if they had
 
04:01:43.790 --> 04:01:43.800 align:start position:0%
been identified earlier
 
04:01:46.550 --> 04:01:46.560 align:start position:0%
clearly screening earlier and often in
 
04:01:48.170 --> 04:01:48.180 align:start position:0%
grades kindergarten through grade two
 
04:01:51.349 --> 04:01:51.359 align:start position:0%
will give teachers more opportunities to
 
04:01:53.330 --> 04:01:53.340 align:start position:0%
identify struggling readers allow
 
04:01:55.010 --> 04:01:55.020 align:start position:0%
districts to provide interventions
 
04:01:57.110 --> 04:01:57.120 align:start position:0%
needed quickly and provide a means for
 
04:01:59.330 --> 04:01:59.340 align:start position:0%
students to access the general education
 
04:02:02.030 --> 04:02:02.040 align:start position:0%
curriculum without frustration
 
04:02:04.729 --> 04:02:04.739 align:start position:0%
in closing I would offer this argument
 
04:02:06.590 --> 04:02:06.600 align:start position:0%
if we know that a quality reading
 
04:02:08.510 --> 04:02:08.520 align:start position:0%
Intervention Program for children
 
04:02:10.189 --> 04:02:10.199 align:start position:0%
struggling to learn to read typically
 
04:02:12.290 --> 04:02:12.300 align:start position:0%
takes two and a half years to implement
 
04:02:14.570 --> 04:02:14.580 align:start position:0%
and if we understand that students who
 
04:02:16.790 --> 04:02:16.800 align:start position:0%
are not reading a grade level by grade 3
 
04:02:19.250 --> 04:02:19.260 align:start position:0%
may never read a grade level
 
04:02:21.410 --> 04:02:21.420 align:start position:0%
and if we recognize that reading at
 
04:02:23.510 --> 04:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
grade level not reading at grade level
 
04:02:25.790 --> 04:02:25.800 align:start position:0%
has severe negative impact on the
 
04:02:27.769 --> 04:02:27.779 align:start position:0%
student's ability to fully access the
 
04:02:29.809 --> 04:02:29.819 align:start position:0%
general education curriculum
 
04:02:31.670 --> 04:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
then we would take proactive steps to
 
04:02:33.530 --> 04:02:33.540 align:start position:0%
assure all struggling students are
 
04:02:33.540 --> 04:02:35.090 align:start position:0%
assure all struggling students are
identified

04:02:35.090 --> 04:02:35.100 align:start position:0%
identified
 
04:02:37.550 --> 04:02:37.560 align:start position:0%
as early as possible and provide
 
04:02:39.410 --> 04:02:39.420 align:start position:0%
appropriate intervention
 
04:02:41.990 --> 04:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
so that they can fully access access and
 
04:02:44.389 --> 04:02:44.399 align:start position:0%
participate in the general education
 
04:02:46.910 --> 04:02:46.920 align:start position:0%
curriculum alongside their same grade
 
04:02:46.920 --> 04:02:49.070 align:start position:0%
curriculum alongside their same grade
peers

04:02:49.070 --> 04:02:49.080 align:start position:0%
peers
 
04:02:51.950 --> 04:02:51.960 align:start position:0%
in addition to this testimony I have
 
04:02:54.530 --> 04:02:54.540 align:start position:0%
another couple a piece of evidence I
 
04:02:56.450 --> 04:02:56.460 align:start position:0%
would like to share with you and it is
 
04:03:00.050 --> 04:03:00.060 align:start position:0%
an excerpt only because I made the
 
04:03:00.060 --> 04:03:01.570 align:start position:0%
an excerpt only because I made the
assertion

04:03:01.570 --> 04:03:01.580 align:start position:0%
assertion
 
04:03:04.809 --> 04:03:04.819 align:start position:0%
that my observation is the not getting
 
04:03:07.429 --> 04:03:07.439 align:start position:0%
intervention for a year and not getting
 
04:03:09.950 --> 04:03:09.960 align:start position:0%
uh referred to special ed for two years
 
04:03:12.170 --> 04:03:12.180 align:start position:0%
I offer this
 
04:03:14.030 --> 04:03:14.040 align:start position:0%
this is an excerpt from the United
 
04:03:16.610 --> 04:03:16.620 align:start position:0%
States Department of Education it's
 
04:03:21.290 --> 04:03:21.300 align:start position:0%
actually Dem dated January 21st 2011.
 
04:03:23.030 --> 04:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
this problem's been going on for a long
 
04:03:23.040 --> 04:03:24.170 align:start position:0%
this problem's been going on for a long
time

04:03:24.170 --> 04:03:24.180 align:start position:0%
time
 
04:03:26.689 --> 04:03:26.699 align:start position:0%
and it describes how the schools are
 
04:03:28.610 --> 04:03:28.620 align:start position:0%
offering tiered interventions one of
 
04:03:30.769 --> 04:03:30.779 align:start position:0%
which is what we refer to as response to
 
04:03:32.510 --> 04:03:32.520 align:start position:0%
intervention that's the general
 
04:03:34.490 --> 04:03:34.500 align:start position:0%
education intervention that these
 
04:03:36.469 --> 04:03:36.479 align:start position:0%
children would be referred to
 
04:03:38.750 --> 04:03:38.760 align:start position:0%
but unfortunately
 
04:03:40.849 --> 04:03:40.859 align:start position:0%
many school districts are using that
 
04:03:43.429 --> 04:03:43.439 align:start position:0%
caveat to hold off on pushing them
 
04:03:45.889 --> 04:03:45.899 align:start position:0%
forward to get evaluations for special
 
04:03:48.710 --> 04:03:48.720 align:start position:0%
education they want to make sure that
 
04:03:51.469 --> 04:03:51.479 align:start position:0%
all everything else is exhausted
 
04:03:53.630 --> 04:03:53.640 align:start position:0%
even though our United States Department
 
04:03:55.309 --> 04:03:55.319 align:start position:0%
of Education said it would be
 
04:03:57.170 --> 04:03:57.180 align:start position:0%
inconsistent with the evaluation
 
04:03:57.180 --> 04:03:59.030 align:start position:0%
inconsistent with the evaluation
provisions

04:03:59.030 --> 04:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
provisions
 
04:04:01.370 --> 04:04:01.380 align:start position:0%
to reject a referral or delay Provisions
 
04:04:03.590 --> 04:04:03.600 align:start position:0%
for an initial evaluation on the basis
 
04:04:06.229 --> 04:04:06.239 align:start position:0%
that that child has not participated in
 
04:04:08.269 --> 04:04:08.279 align:start position:0%
an RTI framework
 
04:04:10.070 --> 04:04:10.080 align:start position:0%
so we should not be using intervention
 
04:04:14.210 --> 04:04:14.220 align:start position:0%
as a reason to delay or deny special
 
04:04:16.610 --> 04:04:16.620 align:start position:0%
educational evaluations
 
04:04:19.189 --> 04:04:19.199 align:start position:0%
in addition I had correspondence with
 
04:04:20.570 --> 04:04:20.580 align:start position:0%
our own state
 
04:04:22.670 --> 04:04:22.680 align:start position:0%
Department of Education to ask them
 
04:04:24.650 --> 04:04:24.660 align:start position:0%
about why this happens if it really
 
04:04:26.870 --> 04:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
happens with this two-year and it was
 
04:04:28.729 --> 04:04:28.739 align:start position:0%
confirmed that because districts are
 
04:04:32.030 --> 04:04:32.040 align:start position:0%
left with the ability to set guidelines
 
04:04:32.040 --> 04:04:32.809 align:start position:0%
left with the ability to set guidelines
um

04:04:32.809 --> 04:04:32.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:04:35.689 --> 04:04:35.699 align:start position:0%
like this regarding evaluations they
 
04:04:37.790 --> 04:04:37.800 align:start position:0%
vary from District to District
 
04:04:40.010 --> 04:04:40.020 align:start position:0%
we need to tighten this up we need to
 
04:04:41.689 --> 04:04:41.699 align:start position:0%
shorten the timelines and we need to get
 
04:04:44.269 --> 04:04:44.279 align:start position:0%
interventions to struggling readers as
 
04:04:46.849 --> 04:04:46.859 align:start position:0%
soon as possible thank you thank you
 
04:04:48.769 --> 04:04:48.779 align:start position:0%
very much are there questions for
 
04:04:48.779 --> 04:04:50.809 align:start position:0%
very much are there questions for
representative

04:04:50.809 --> 04:04:50.819 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:04:54.110 --> 04:04:54.120 align:start position:0%
yes represent dry thank you Mr chairman
 
04:04:56.750 --> 04:04:56.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking this up
 
04:04:58.969 --> 04:04:58.979 align:start position:0%
it says on the the fiscal note in the
 
04:05:00.950 --> 04:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
end or the chart there that it says an
 
04:05:03.050 --> 04:05:03.060 align:start position:0%
indeterminable increase
 
04:05:04.729 --> 04:05:04.739 align:start position:0%
um this is a lot of tests that are going
 
04:05:07.729 --> 04:05:07.739 align:start position:0%
on is there a cost to this
 
04:05:09.889 --> 04:05:09.899 align:start position:0%
which one are you referring to this um
 
04:05:12.349 --> 04:05:12.359 align:start position:0%
no I'm referring to the yeah oh I'm
 
04:05:12.359 --> 04:05:13.490 align:start position:0%
no I'm referring to the yeah oh I'm
sorry

04:05:13.490 --> 04:05:13.500 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
04:05:15.710 --> 04:05:15.720 align:start position:0%
um that I would not be able to answer
 
04:05:17.809 --> 04:05:17.819 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry but I would be able to say
 
04:05:20.150 --> 04:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
that in the upper grades
 
04:05:20.160 --> 04:05:20.990 align:start position:0%
that in the upper grades
um

04:05:20.990 --> 04:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:05:23.150 --> 04:05:23.160 align:start position:0%
you could just give a spelling test and
 
04:05:25.969 --> 04:05:25.979 align:start position:0%
you can figure out the kids that are not
 
04:05:27.650 --> 04:05:27.660 align:start position:0%
they don't know their phonics if they
 
04:05:29.330 --> 04:05:29.340 align:start position:0%
can't spell they're not able to read
 
04:05:31.729 --> 04:05:31.739 align:start position:0%
either they don't know the rules
 
04:05:36.469 --> 04:05:36.479 align:start position:0%
um the test that I give it's a um in the
 
04:05:38.030 --> 04:05:38.040 align:start position:0%
upper grades it's also for the lower
 
04:05:38.040 --> 04:05:39.349 align:start position:0%
upper grades it's also for the lower
grades

04:05:39.349 --> 04:05:39.359 align:start position:0%
grades
 
04:05:41.450 --> 04:05:41.460 align:start position:0%
I give it individually I think the test
 
04:05:45.110 --> 04:05:45.120 align:start position:0%
itself costs about 150 dollars but I
 
04:05:46.849 --> 04:05:46.859 align:start position:0%
Implement that to all the students that
 
04:05:50.870 --> 04:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
I um then assess it's called the um
 
04:05:52.790 --> 04:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
oh the West
 
04:05:54.830 --> 04:05:54.840 align:start position:0%
the word in identification and spelling
 
04:05:54.840 --> 04:05:55.910 align:start position:0%
the word in identification and spelling
test

04:05:55.910 --> 04:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
test
 
04:05:58.729 --> 04:05:58.739 align:start position:0%
you may follow up yes I think I'm
 
04:05:59.929 --> 04:05:59.939 align:start position:0%
referring to the one that was
 
04:06:03.590 --> 04:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
specifically talked about in the bill
 
04:06:03.600 --> 04:06:04.250 align:start position:0%
specifically talked about in the bill
um

04:06:04.250 --> 04:06:04.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:06:04.260 --> 04:06:05.929 align:start position:0%
um
online

04:06:05.929 --> 04:06:05.939 align:start position:0%
online
 
04:06:10.189 --> 04:06:10.199 align:start position:0%
five yep yep oh the Dibbles
 
04:06:12.469 --> 04:06:12.479 align:start position:0%
um I I will be honest I have never
 
04:06:14.689 --> 04:06:14.699 align:start position:0%
um implemented the Devils because I was
 
04:06:16.670 --> 04:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
in the middle school but I do understand
 
04:06:19.330 --> 04:06:19.340 align:start position:0%
that that one is also looking at fluency
 
04:06:22.490 --> 04:06:22.500 align:start position:0%
and we do have what used to be known as
 
04:06:25.370 --> 04:06:25.380 align:start position:0%
the gold standard for dyslexia was
 
04:06:28.309 --> 04:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
called a Ras Rand it's a rapid automatic
 
04:06:31.370 --> 04:06:31.380 align:start position:0%
naming automaticity naming that's a very
 
04:06:33.889 --> 04:06:33.899 align:start position:0%
quick test to give
 
04:06:39.110 --> 04:06:39.120 align:start position:0%
I am not a fan of putting
 
04:06:41.750 --> 04:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
expecting children to words to read
 
04:06:44.210 --> 04:06:44.220 align:start position:0%
specific numbers of words that has kind
 
04:06:46.189 --> 04:06:46.199 align:start position:0%
of Fallen by the wayside we now say that
 
04:06:49.790 --> 04:06:49.800 align:start position:0%
fluency is having the children read at a
 
04:06:51.950 --> 04:06:51.960 align:start position:0%
speed in which they can comprehend
 
04:06:54.410 --> 04:06:54.420 align:start position:0%
and so we should not be really measuring
 
04:06:56.090 --> 04:06:56.100 align:start position:0%
that anymore
 
04:06:57.650 --> 04:06:57.660 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:06:59.870 --> 04:06:59.880 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
04:07:02.090 --> 04:07:02.100 align:start position:0%
yes represent Belcher
 
04:07:04.849 --> 04:07:04.859 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair my question relates
 
04:07:04.859 --> 04:07:06.290 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair my question relates
to

04:07:06.290 --> 04:07:06.300 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:07:08.269 --> 04:07:08.279 align:start position:0%
um the the frequency and amount of
 
04:07:11.510 --> 04:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
testing done now I'm sure we all know
 
04:07:14.870 --> 04:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
that no test is absolutely 100 perfect
 
04:07:17.870 --> 04:07:17.880 align:start position:0%
um there there must be some rate of
 
04:07:20.269 --> 04:07:20.279 align:start position:0%
false positives that come along with
 
04:07:22.070 --> 04:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
this and do we have any idea what that
 
04:07:24.349 --> 04:07:24.359 align:start position:0%
is and how that might impact
 
04:07:26.510 --> 04:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
like how many students could possibly be
 
04:07:30.110 --> 04:07:30.120 align:start position:0%
impacted being put on this path that are
 
04:07:35.269 --> 04:07:35.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:37.670 --> 04:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
it's not really a path because it would
 
04:07:39.610 --> 04:07:39.620 align:start position:0%
be an approach to how we're teaching
 
04:07:43.969 --> 04:07:43.979 align:start position:0%
with regard to how far along I will tell
 
04:07:46.309 --> 04:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
you that I thought it should go through
 
04:07:48.170 --> 04:07:48.180 align:start position:0%
Middle School at least once a year
 
04:07:48.180 --> 04:07:49.729 align:start position:0%
Middle School at least once a year
screening

04:07:49.729 --> 04:07:49.739 align:start position:0%
screening
 
04:07:52.490 --> 04:07:52.500 align:start position:0%
these children are very difficult to
 
04:07:52.500 --> 04:07:53.349 align:start position:0%
these children are very difficult to
even

04:07:53.349 --> 04:07:53.359 align:start position:0%
even
 
04:07:56.570 --> 04:07:56.580 align:start position:0%
recognize them because they
 
04:07:59.269 --> 04:07:59.279 align:start position:0%
they are really proficient at hiding
 
04:08:00.769 --> 04:08:00.779 align:start position:0%
their disability
 
04:08:03.290 --> 04:08:03.300 align:start position:0%
personally I even would say I hate
 
04:08:06.050 --> 04:08:06.060 align:start position:0%
referring it to it as a disability I
 
04:08:07.790 --> 04:08:07.800 align:start position:0%
think it's only a disability because our
 
04:08:09.769 --> 04:08:09.779 align:start position:0%
education system is geared for
 
04:08:12.050 --> 04:08:12.060 align:start position:0%
left-brained Learners and dyslexics
 
04:08:14.570 --> 04:08:14.580 align:start position:0%
tends to be a right brain learner so if
 
04:08:17.330 --> 04:08:17.340 align:start position:0%
we would match up how our children learn
 
04:08:20.170 --> 04:08:20.180 align:start position:0%
to how we teach
 
04:08:23.570 --> 04:08:23.580 align:start position:0%
that would solve the problem right there
 
04:08:25.130 --> 04:08:25.140 align:start position:0%
and I think that that's what this
 
04:08:26.870 --> 04:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
screening does it really is going to
 
04:08:30.410 --> 04:08:30.420 align:start position:0%
look at whether or not they have those
 
04:08:33.349 --> 04:08:33.359 align:start position:0%
skills needed for what we would normally
 
04:08:35.570 --> 04:08:35.580 align:start position:0%
think of as more like in phonics being
 
04:08:37.670 --> 04:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
able to recognize letter sounds word
 
04:08:40.090 --> 04:08:40.100 align:start position:0%
sounds put them together pull them apart
 
04:08:44.090 --> 04:08:44.100 align:start position:0%
and manipulate them and children
 
04:08:44.100 --> 04:08:45.530 align:start position:0%
and manipulate them and children
um

04:08:45.530 --> 04:08:45.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:47.750 --> 04:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
some children actually need to learn
 
04:08:50.330 --> 04:08:50.340 align:start position:0%
that I would say that there's also with
 
04:08:52.490 --> 04:08:52.500 align:start position:0%
children with dyslexia
 
04:08:54.889 --> 04:08:54.899 align:start position:0%
it's in sometimes it's an auditory
 
04:08:58.070 --> 04:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
disability if a child had a lot of ear
 
04:08:58.080 --> 04:08:59.809 align:start position:0%
disability if a child had a lot of ear
infections

04:08:59.809 --> 04:08:59.819 align:start position:0%
infections
 
04:08:59.819 --> 04:09:00.830 align:start position:0%
infections
um

04:09:00.830 --> 04:09:00.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:09:03.170 --> 04:09:03.180 align:start position:0%
they were never they never heard the
 
04:09:04.610 --> 04:09:04.620 align:start position:0%
sounds they never learned that
 
04:09:06.590 --> 04:09:06.600 align:start position:0%
articulation and so they must be taught
 
04:09:09.710 --> 04:09:09.720 align:start position:0%
it I know that my own son he had what
 
04:09:10.870 --> 04:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
was called
 
04:09:14.510 --> 04:09:14.520 align:start position:0%
immature speech growing up due to
 
04:09:14.520 --> 04:09:16.070 align:start position:0%
immature speech growing up due to
um

04:09:16.070 --> 04:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:09:18.950 --> 04:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
your infections I was told oh don't
 
04:09:20.870 --> 04:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
worry that will work itself out when
 
04:09:23.090 --> 04:09:23.100 align:start position:0%
they start teaching phonics but we don't
 
04:09:25.189 --> 04:09:25.199 align:start position:0%
teach phonics anymore so it never worked
 
04:09:28.070 --> 04:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
itself out and he had to be explicitly
 
04:09:28.080 --> 04:09:30.710 align:start position:0%
itself out and he had to be explicitly
taught

04:09:30.710 --> 04:09:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:35.809 --> 04:09:35.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:37.370 --> 04:09:37.380 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering
 
04:09:39.349 --> 04:09:39.359 align:start position:0%
um how this is going to deal with the
 
04:09:41.570 --> 04:09:41.580 align:start position:0%
issue that schools were
 
04:09:43.510 --> 04:09:43.520 align:start position:0%
putting off
 
04:09:46.130 --> 04:09:46.140 align:start position:0%
dealing with the issues or even testing
 
04:09:49.250 --> 04:09:49.260 align:start position:0%
until they had somebody who could take
 
04:09:52.150 --> 04:09:52.160 align:start position:0%
care of it and here we're going to be
 
04:09:55.450 --> 04:09:55.460 align:start position:0%
finding these students the question is
 
04:09:59.870 --> 04:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
what are we going to be doing is there
 
04:10:03.050 --> 04:10:03.060 align:start position:0%
is there known standard ways of dealing
 
04:10:05.210 --> 04:10:05.220 align:start position:0%
with this that a school would then do or
 
04:10:07.610 --> 04:10:07.620 align:start position:0%
do they actually have to wait for that
 
04:10:11.570 --> 04:10:11.580 align:start position:0%
speech reading Specialist or whatever
 
04:10:11.580 --> 04:10:12.229 align:start position:0%
speech reading Specialist or whatever
um

04:10:12.229 --> 04:10:12.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:10:12.239 --> 04:10:13.429 align:start position:0%
um
Etc

04:10:13.429 --> 04:10:13.439 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
04:10:15.590 --> 04:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
absolutely and thank you so much for
 
04:10:19.210 --> 04:10:19.220 align:start position:0%
that question if the schools
 
04:10:22.550 --> 04:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
would go back to teaching phonics or
 
04:10:24.349 --> 04:10:24.359 align:start position:0%
even include phonics within their
 
04:10:26.150 --> 04:10:26.160 align:start position:0%
reading lessons and if they would
 
04:10:26.160 --> 04:10:27.370 align:start position:0%
reading lessons and if they would
explicitly

04:10:27.370 --> 04:10:27.380 align:start position:0%
explicitly
 
04:10:31.070 --> 04:10:31.080 align:start position:0%
and systematically teach the rules of
 
04:10:33.830 --> 04:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
reading and phonics this could all be
 
04:10:35.389 --> 04:10:35.399 align:start position:0%
addressed in the general education
 
04:10:38.150 --> 04:10:38.160 align:start position:0%
classroom and all students could benefit
 
04:10:41.150 --> 04:10:41.160 align:start position:0%
from that Intervention which at that
 
04:10:42.229 --> 04:10:42.239 align:start position:0%
point would just be part of the
 
04:10:42.239 --> 04:10:43.790 align:start position:0%
point would just be part of the
curriculum

04:10:43.790 --> 04:10:43.800 align:start position:0%
curriculum
 
04:10:45.769 --> 04:10:45.779 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you I have a question
 
04:10:48.170 --> 04:10:48.180 align:start position:0%
for you yes sir um I was in education
 
04:10:49.670 --> 04:10:49.680 align:start position:0%
many many years as well Elementary
 
04:10:49.680 --> 04:10:51.110 align:start position:0%
many many years as well Elementary
education

04:10:51.110 --> 04:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
education
 
04:10:54.110 --> 04:10:54.120 align:start position:0%
and I've heard it stated several times
 
04:10:57.889 --> 04:10:57.899 align:start position:0%
now that if we teach phonics is there
 
04:11:00.290 --> 04:11:00.300 align:start position:0%
any data that you have stating that
 
04:11:03.229 --> 04:11:03.239 align:start position:0%
schools are not teaching phonics now or
 
04:11:05.269 --> 04:11:05.279 align:start position:0%
that we're doing what I heard you
 
04:11:09.469 --> 04:11:09.479 align:start position:0%
earlier say that some types of programs
 
04:11:11.450 --> 04:11:11.460 align:start position:0%
are needed by some children in other
 
04:11:13.910 --> 04:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
words that it's learning style teaching
 
04:11:15.950 --> 04:11:15.960 align:start position:0%
style line those two together and I
 
04:11:18.349 --> 04:11:18.359 align:start position:0%
think you got it however
 
04:11:18.359 --> 04:11:19.189 align:start position:0%
think you got it however
um

04:11:19.189 --> 04:11:19.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:22.490 --> 04:11:22.500 align:start position:0%
in my first days as an elementary school
 
04:11:25.429 --> 04:11:25.439 align:start position:0%
principal and teacher there are a number
 
04:11:29.030 --> 04:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
of different methods used to help kids
 
04:11:31.189 --> 04:11:31.199 align:start position:0%
learn how to read some more event
 
04:11:34.130 --> 04:11:34.140 align:start position:0%
phonics some were other methods which we
 
04:11:34.140 --> 04:11:35.030 align:start position:0%
phonics some were other methods which we
have

04:11:35.030 --> 04:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:11:38.689 --> 04:11:38.699 align:start position:0%
so summing up my question again I've
 
04:11:41.030 --> 04:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
heard that it's stated now several times
 
04:11:43.610 --> 04:11:43.620 align:start position:0%
not just by you that phonics isn't
 
04:11:45.469 --> 04:11:45.479 align:start position:0%
taught anymore
 
04:11:48.229 --> 04:11:48.239 align:start position:0%
do we want to really do we have data
 
04:11:48.239 --> 04:11:49.189 align:start position:0%
do we want to really do we have data
that

04:11:49.189 --> 04:11:49.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:11:51.229 --> 04:11:51.239 align:start position:0%
you know support that
 
04:11:51.239 --> 04:11:52.689 align:start position:0%
you know support that
yes

04:11:52.689 --> 04:11:52.699 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:11:55.969 --> 04:11:55.979 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question there is
 
04:11:58.969 --> 04:11:58.979 align:start position:0%
definitely data or data to to support
 
04:12:02.030 --> 04:12:02.040 align:start position:0%
that in New Hampshire we have moved to a
 
04:12:04.370 --> 04:12:04.380 align:start position:0%
balanced literacy program and in those
 
04:12:07.010 --> 04:12:07.020 align:start position:0%
programs they teach word memorization
 
04:12:09.349 --> 04:12:09.359 align:start position:0%
there is very little phonics they are
 
04:12:11.450 --> 04:12:11.460 align:start position:0%
starting to integrate it now because in
 
04:12:11.460 --> 04:12:12.790 align:start position:0%
starting to integrate it now because in
2018

04:12:12.790 --> 04:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
2018
 
04:12:16.250 --> 04:12:16.260 align:start position:0%
the two main programs fontus and panel
 
04:12:19.729 --> 04:12:19.739 align:start position:0%
and Lucy Calkins were debunked by
 
04:12:21.830 --> 04:12:21.840 align:start position:0%
cognitive scientists who said that that
 
04:12:23.990 --> 04:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
is not how teacher that children read
 
04:12:26.269 --> 04:12:26.279 align:start position:0%
that using those programs we're teaching
 
04:12:28.670 --> 04:12:28.680 align:start position:0%
children to read like disabled or
 
04:12:31.750 --> 04:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
struggling readers we're teaching them
 
04:12:36.530 --> 04:12:36.540 align:start position:0%
to memorize words to use strategies like
 
04:12:38.510 --> 04:12:38.520 align:start position:0%
look at the picture in the book and then
 
04:12:40.910 --> 04:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
you can figure out the word and yes
 
04:12:43.070 --> 04:12:43.080 align:start position:0%
those are some strategies that we teach
 
04:12:44.630 --> 04:12:44.640 align:start position:0%
children as we go along when we're
 
04:12:46.250 --> 04:12:46.260 align:start position:0%
teaching them comprehension and we say
 
04:12:48.050 --> 04:12:48.060 align:start position:0%
well look at the rest of the sentence or
 
04:12:50.030 --> 04:12:50.040 align:start position:0%
look at the pictures but let me give you
 
04:12:51.650 --> 04:12:51.660 align:start position:0%
an example
 
04:12:55.250 --> 04:12:55.260 align:start position:0%
I was working with a child and we were
 
04:12:57.410 --> 04:12:57.420 align:start position:0%
in for beginning of first grade
 
04:13:02.450 --> 04:13:02.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:05.570 --> 04:13:05.580 align:start position:0%
did it several several times and I asked
 
04:13:07.309 --> 04:13:07.319 align:start position:0%
her let's pull it together what do we
 
04:13:09.590 --> 04:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
have and I was so excited because I
 
04:13:11.210 --> 04:13:11.220 align:start position:0%
thought she had it
 
04:13:13.309 --> 04:13:13.319 align:start position:0%
and she looked up
 
04:13:15.769 --> 04:13:15.779 align:start position:0%
and she looked all around like she was
 
04:13:17.870 --> 04:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
trying to find some clue
 
04:13:21.769 --> 04:13:21.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:23.929 --> 04:13:23.939 align:start position:0%
that's what's happening with the balance
 
04:13:26.330 --> 04:13:26.340 align:start position:0%
balance literacy the children are
 
04:13:28.790 --> 04:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
learning to rely on these strategies
 
04:13:31.910 --> 04:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
instead of learning the letter sounds
 
04:13:34.670 --> 04:13:34.680 align:start position:0%
and putting them together to make words
 
04:13:38.269 --> 04:13:38.279 align:start position:0%
it has been extremely detrimental and we
 
04:13:41.210 --> 04:13:41.220 align:start position:0%
have known this for years as I said I
 
04:13:43.670 --> 04:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
could provide you with the research or
 
04:13:45.830 --> 04:13:45.840 align:start position:0%
the articles that I'm stating that were
 
04:13:48.650 --> 04:13:48.660 align:start position:0%
written in 2018 that say that's the
 
04:13:51.469 --> 04:13:51.479 align:start position:0%
balance literacy is not how to teach
 
04:13:52.849 --> 04:13:52.859 align:start position:0%
children how to read
 
04:13:54.590 --> 04:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
thank you thank representative Cass
 
04:13:54.600 --> 04:13:55.370 align:start position:0%
thank you thank representative Cass
Academy

04:13:55.370 --> 04:13:55.380 align:start position:0%
Academy
 
04:13:58.370 --> 04:13:58.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'm going to rely on
 
04:14:00.050 --> 04:14:00.060 align:start position:0%
your professionalism thank you for all
 
04:14:02.030 --> 04:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
your information I appreciate it I too
 
04:14:04.790 --> 04:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
was an educator many years not as far
 
04:14:07.550 --> 04:14:07.560 align:start position:0%
back those representative Ladd
 
04:14:09.969 --> 04:14:09.979 align:start position:0%
um oh
 
04:14:13.610 --> 04:14:13.620 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I owe
 
04:14:13.620 --> 04:14:14.570 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I owe
um

04:14:14.570 --> 04:14:14.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:16.670 --> 04:14:16.680 align:start position:0%
the question that I have thinking about
 
04:14:18.650 --> 04:14:18.660 align:start position:0%
this big picture and if you're you know
 
04:14:22.490 --> 04:14:22.500 align:start position:0%
there's data out there supporting that
 
04:14:24.650 --> 04:14:24.660 align:start position:0%
these assessments are not done in a
 
04:14:26.510 --> 04:14:26.520 align:start position:0%
timely manner to be able to catch the
 
04:14:26.520 --> 04:14:28.010 align:start position:0%
timely manner to be able to catch the
disability

04:14:28.010 --> 04:14:28.020 align:start position:0%
disability
 
04:14:31.130 --> 04:14:31.140 align:start position:0%
do you foresee I mean I know that there
 
04:14:33.469 --> 04:14:33.479 align:start position:0%
are schools that do not have reading
 
04:14:35.570 --> 04:14:35.580 align:start position:0%
Specialists because it adds a cost to
 
04:14:37.729 --> 04:14:37.739 align:start position:0%
their budget right personnel
 
04:14:39.710 --> 04:14:39.720 align:start position:0%
but if this were implemented do you
 
04:14:42.170 --> 04:14:42.180 align:start position:0%
foresee that teachers could implement
 
04:14:42.180 --> 04:14:43.189 align:start position:0%
foresee that teachers could implement
this

04:14:43.189 --> 04:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:14:46.189 --> 04:14:46.199 align:start position:0%
with intervention or would they require
 
04:14:48.590 --> 04:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
reading Specialists on staff because I
 
04:14:50.689 --> 04:14:50.699 align:start position:0%
know how valuable a reading specialist
 
04:14:50.699 --> 04:14:51.650 align:start position:0%
know how valuable a reading specialist
is

04:14:51.650 --> 04:14:51.660 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:14:53.929 --> 04:14:53.939 align:start position:0%
in support of you know the the reading
 
04:14:53.939 --> 04:14:55.309 align:start position:0%
in support of you know the the reading
instruction

04:14:55.309 --> 04:14:55.319 align:start position:0%
instruction
 
04:14:57.590 --> 04:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
I do not just hear that
 
04:15:00.830 --> 04:15:00.840 align:start position:0%
I do not believe that doing these types
 
04:15:02.689 --> 04:15:02.699 align:start position:0%
of screenings would require a reading
 
04:15:05.090 --> 04:15:05.100 align:start position:0%
specialist to do that I think that the
 
04:15:08.090 --> 04:15:08.100 align:start position:0%
general education teacher can do the
 
04:15:08.100 --> 04:15:09.189 align:start position:0%
general education teacher can do the
screenings

04:15:09.189 --> 04:15:09.199 align:start position:0%
screenings
 
04:15:13.010 --> 04:15:13.020 align:start position:0%
and it's it's the identifying them and
 
04:15:15.290 --> 04:15:15.300 align:start position:0%
then addressing it immediately that's
 
04:15:17.330 --> 04:15:17.340 align:start position:0%
where there seems to be the Gap is
 
04:15:19.189 --> 04:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
getting that intervention to them as
 
04:15:20.750 --> 04:15:20.760 align:start position:0%
fast as possible
 
04:15:22.910 --> 04:15:22.920 align:start position:0%
I will say that those two reading
 
04:15:24.950 --> 04:15:24.960 align:start position:0%
programs that I mentioned fontus and
 
04:15:28.070 --> 04:15:28.080 align:start position:0%
Pinnell and the Lucy Hawkins are and
 
04:15:29.929 --> 04:15:29.939 align:start position:0%
actually Lucy Hawkins there is an actual
 
04:15:32.570 --> 04:15:32.580 align:start position:0%
article where she admits that her
 
04:15:34.849 --> 04:15:34.859 align:start position:0%
program does not work and that she did
 
04:15:37.070 --> 04:15:37.080 align:start position:0%
not understand the science of reading
 
04:15:38.950 --> 04:15:38.960 align:start position:0%
when she put that program together
 
04:15:41.689 --> 04:15:41.699 align:start position:0%
but those two programs now are
 
04:15:44.510 --> 04:15:44.520 align:start position:0%
scrambling to integrate the phonics into
 
04:15:46.670 --> 04:15:46.680 align:start position:0%
their programs
 
04:15:47.929 --> 04:15:47.939 align:start position:0%
um I don't know how that's going to work
 
04:15:47.939 --> 04:15:49.250 align:start position:0%
um I don't know how that's going to work
because

04:15:49.250 --> 04:15:49.260 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:15:49.260 --> 04:15:50.389 align:start position:0%
because
um

04:15:50.389 --> 04:15:50.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:52.250 --> 04:15:52.260 align:start position:0%
when I look at the little books that
 
04:15:53.570 --> 04:15:53.580 align:start position:0%
they're giving them to read if we look
 
04:15:56.689 --> 04:15:56.699 align:start position:0%
at fontus and panel they have a a way of
 
04:15:59.510 --> 04:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
reading a letter A B C what what letter
 
04:16:02.210 --> 04:16:02.220 align:start position:0%
are you on and I look at the ones that
 
04:16:04.670 --> 04:16:04.680 align:start position:0%
are early readers and I'm just like oh
 
04:16:06.110 --> 04:16:06.120 align:start position:0%
you got to be kidding me
 
04:16:08.030 --> 04:16:08.040 align:start position:0%
I mean I know what the scope and
 
04:16:09.950 --> 04:16:09.960 align:start position:0%
sequence is to teaching reading and I'm
 
04:16:11.389 --> 04:16:11.399 align:start position:0%
looking at these little books and I'm
 
04:16:12.950 --> 04:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
like well there's a closed syllable
 
04:16:15.410 --> 04:16:15.420 align:start position:0%
there's a magic e there's a r control
 
04:16:19.189 --> 04:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
word there's a you know and
 
04:16:21.889 --> 04:16:21.899 align:start position:0%
a whole nother syllable type
 
04:16:24.110 --> 04:16:24.120 align:start position:0%
these children haven't been taught so
 
04:16:25.550 --> 04:16:25.560 align:start position:0%
it's obvious the only way they can read
 
04:16:27.410 --> 04:16:27.420 align:start position:0%
these little beginner readers is that
 
04:16:29.349 --> 04:16:29.359 align:start position:0%
they're memorizing them
 
04:16:32.090 --> 04:16:32.100 align:start position:0%
and that's where we're having the
 
04:16:35.570 --> 04:16:35.580 align:start position:0%
problems we really need to match
 
04:16:38.269 --> 04:16:38.279 align:start position:0%
um how we teach to how our children
 
04:16:38.279 --> 04:16:40.729 align:start position:0%
um how we teach to how our children
learn

04:16:40.729 --> 04:16:40.739 align:start position:0%
learn
 
04:16:43.370 --> 04:16:43.380 align:start position:0%
Jefferson Woodcock thank you chairman
 
04:16:45.110 --> 04:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thank you everybody's
 
04:16:46.370 --> 04:16:46.380 align:start position:0%
information about
 
04:16:48.710 --> 04:16:48.720 align:start position:0%
um I agree with a lot particularly the
 
04:16:51.110 --> 04:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
emotionally intervention and the
 
04:16:53.210 --> 04:16:53.220 align:start position:0%
frustration and then suspending instead
 
04:16:55.969 --> 04:16:55.979 align:start position:0%
of maybe look foolish much easier and as
 
04:16:58.250 --> 04:16:58.260 align:start position:0%
they mature and get the higher grade
 
04:17:00.290 --> 04:17:00.300 align:start position:0%
levels they prefer to be seeing the sent
 
04:17:02.030 --> 04:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
down the principal's office than being
 
04:17:03.590 --> 04:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
in school and not be able to read and
 
04:17:06.349 --> 04:17:06.359 align:start position:0%
just goes on and on but my question is
 
04:17:08.689 --> 04:17:08.699 align:start position:0%
is a request you indicated to
 
04:17:09.830 --> 04:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
representative Vlad that you had
 
04:17:11.630 --> 04:17:11.640 align:start position:0%
information based on the New Hampshire
 
04:17:14.450 --> 04:17:14.460 align:start position:0%
basically and how ineffective it was
 
04:17:17.389 --> 04:17:17.399 align:start position:0%
right he said I missed what you had you
 
04:17:20.689 --> 04:17:20.699 align:start position:0%
had uh an article for information
 
04:17:22.670 --> 04:17:22.680 align:start position:0%
Mark that you answered representative
 
04:17:25.670 --> 04:17:25.680 align:start position:0%
Ladd my request is that you email that
 
04:17:27.349 --> 04:17:27.359 align:start position:0%
data to the full leg committee
 
04:17:29.809 --> 04:17:29.819 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you absolutely thank
 
04:17:31.670 --> 04:17:31.680 align:start position:0%
you thank you for the questions
 
04:17:33.349 --> 04:17:33.359 align:start position:0%
representative Tana
 
04:17:35.150 --> 04:17:35.160 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
04:17:37.969 --> 04:17:37.979 align:start position:0%
question and thanks for bringing your
 
04:17:40.010 --> 04:17:40.020 align:start position:0%
expertise to this
 
04:17:43.250 --> 04:17:43.260 align:start position:0%
um very important issue how do we reach
 
04:17:46.010 --> 04:17:46.020 align:start position:0%
those students that are going to Charter
 
04:17:48.410 --> 04:17:48.420 align:start position:0%
Schools or uh maybe are homeschooled is
 
04:17:50.809 --> 04:17:50.819 align:start position:0%
it is this any of this testing to child
 
04:17:52.729 --> 04:17:52.739 align:start position:0%
find or
 
04:17:55.250 --> 04:17:55.260 align:start position:0%
um can be done any anywhere in the
 
04:17:57.710 --> 04:17:57.720 align:start position:0%
community that would catch these
 
04:18:00.469 --> 04:18:00.479 align:start position:0%
children I would think it would be able
 
04:18:03.050 --> 04:18:03.060 align:start position:0%
to I would think that the uh teachers in
 
04:18:05.809 --> 04:18:05.819 align:start position:0%
the charter school can also Implement
 
04:18:08.210 --> 04:18:08.220 align:start position:0%
these screenings I'd have to look at and
 
04:18:11.510 --> 04:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
know what which uh reading program the
 
04:18:13.429 --> 04:18:13.439 align:start position:0%
charter schools are using I will say
 
04:18:15.830 --> 04:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
that I know that the Parochial School in
 
04:18:18.349 --> 04:18:18.359 align:start position:0%
my town teaches phonics and they always
 
04:18:20.150 --> 04:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
have they've never went to balanced
 
04:18:20.160 --> 04:18:21.170 align:start position:0%
have they've never went to balanced
literacy

04:18:21.170 --> 04:18:21.180 align:start position:0%
literacy
 
04:18:21.180 --> 04:18:23.710 align:start position:0%
literacy
so

04:18:23.710 --> 04:18:23.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:18:26.030 --> 04:18:26.040 align:start position:0%
representative Belgium
 
04:18:27.889 --> 04:18:27.899 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
04:18:30.590 --> 04:18:30.600 align:start position:0%
um you indicated that if uh if New
 
04:18:31.910 --> 04:18:31.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire were to return to a
 
04:18:33.710 --> 04:18:33.720 align:start position:0%
phonics-based learning model it would it
 
04:18:35.150 --> 04:18:35.160 align:start position:0%
would really solve the underlying
 
04:18:36.950 --> 04:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
problem here and probably eliminate the
 
04:18:40.070 --> 04:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
need for a lot of this so is there any
 
04:18:42.050 --> 04:18:42.060 align:start position:0%
is there going to be a bill forthcoming
 
04:18:45.830 --> 04:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
perhaps to that would that would do that
 
04:18:48.110 --> 04:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
I believe there is a bill that will be
 
04:18:50.389 --> 04:18:50.399 align:start position:0%
coming that's going to bring phonics and
 
04:18:52.550 --> 04:18:52.560 align:start position:0%
try and get phonics back in keep in mind
 
04:18:55.130 --> 04:18:55.140 align:start position:0%
that phonics is not a whole reading
 
04:18:57.170 --> 04:18:57.180 align:start position:0%
program it's only a piece of it we still
 
04:19:00.229 --> 04:19:00.239 align:start position:0%
have to address the vocabulary we still
 
04:19:01.610 --> 04:19:01.620 align:start position:0%
have to address the
 
04:19:01.620 --> 04:19:02.349 align:start position:0%
have to address the
um

04:19:02.349 --> 04:19:02.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:19:04.370 --> 04:19:04.380 align:start position:0%
comprehension and all the other five
 
04:19:06.290 --> 04:19:06.300 align:start position:0%
components of reading
 
04:19:08.030 --> 04:19:08.040 align:start position:0%
um but yes I do
 
04:19:09.889 --> 04:19:09.899 align:start position:0%
know that there is a bill coming forth
 
04:19:12.050 --> 04:19:12.060 align:start position:0%
you'll see me again
 
04:19:13.790 --> 04:19:13.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I'm very pleased to
 
04:19:15.410 --> 04:19:15.420 align:start position:0%
hear you say it's not the only component
 
04:19:17.269 --> 04:19:17.279 align:start position:0%
because I was thinking vocabulary
 
04:19:18.710 --> 04:19:18.720 align:start position:0%
comprehension we used to have the gay
 
04:19:21.050 --> 04:19:21.060 align:start position:0%
community test and but I can remember a
 
04:19:22.969 --> 04:19:22.979 align:start position:0%
lot of old SRA science research
 
04:19:25.070 --> 04:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
Associates one of the titles of the book
 
04:19:28.189 --> 04:19:28.199 align:start position:0%
is I recall a pig can jig now there you
 
04:19:31.670 --> 04:19:31.680 align:start position:0%
go uh and well that was the topic of one
 
04:19:32.929 --> 04:19:32.939 align:start position:0%
of the books and I think that was that
 
04:19:35.210 --> 04:19:35.220 align:start position:0%
first or beginning that would be a
 
04:19:37.130 --> 04:19:37.140 align:start position:0%
closed syllable first thing that they're
 
04:19:38.570 --> 04:19:38.580 align:start position:0%
going to learn got the Blends the
 
04:19:40.189 --> 04:19:40.199 align:start position:0%
digraphs and everything done
 
04:19:42.410 --> 04:19:42.420 align:start position:0%
uh further questions we do have some
 
04:19:45.530 --> 04:19:45.540 align:start position:0%
other people here to testify today
 
04:19:48.290 --> 04:19:48.300 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you so much
 
04:19:48.300 --> 04:19:51.050 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you so much

is it Casey welcome
 
04:19:57.790 --> 04:19:57.800 align:start position:0%
thank you okay
 
04:20:00.830 --> 04:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
good afternoon

New Hampshire chapter of decoding
 
04:20:11.090 --> 04:20:11.100 align:start position:0%
dyslexia which there's somebody behind
 
04:20:13.269 --> 04:20:13.279 align:start position:0%
me is hoping to testify who's a current
 
04:20:15.830 --> 04:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
uh president of the decoding dyslexia in
 
04:20:17.450 --> 04:20:17.460 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I've also been a board
 
04:20:18.530 --> 04:20:18.540 align:start position:0%

child I testified in front of this
 
04:20:29.929 --> 04:20:29.939 align:start position:0%
Committee in 2015 as representative evil
 
04:20:32.090 --> 04:20:32.100 align:start position:0%
mentioned in support of at the time it
 
04:20:34.729 --> 04:20:34.739 align:start position:0%
was HB 1644 and that eventually became
 
04:20:37.370 --> 04:20:37.380 align:start position:0%
what we call the dyslexia law my son
 
04:20:38.929 --> 04:20:38.939 align:start position:0%
testified as well
 
04:20:40.910 --> 04:20:40.920 align:start position:0%
at the time he was finishing his first
 
04:20:42.530 --> 04:20:42.540 align:start position:0%
semester at Plymouth State and he
 
04:20:44.689 --> 04:20:44.699 align:start position:0%
testified to you that he never imagined
 
04:20:46.309 --> 04:20:46.319 align:start position:0%
ever going to college when he was in
 
04:20:48.650 --> 04:20:48.660 align:start position:0%
Middle School today he's working as an
 
04:20:50.510 --> 04:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
architect design intern in Gloucester
 
04:20:52.429 --> 04:20:52.439 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts he has one more semester
 
04:20:55.070 --> 04:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
to finish a master's in architecture and
 
04:20:56.990 --> 04:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
will be licensed at the end of the year
 
04:20:58.790 --> 04:20:58.800 align:start position:0%
his school did not have a screening
 
04:21:00.950 --> 04:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
process in K-2 he struggled through
 
04:21:02.689 --> 04:21:02.699 align:start position:0%
Elementary School the teachers did not
 
04:21:04.250 --> 04:21:04.260 align:start position:0%
have the knowledge or experience to
 
04:21:07.070 --> 04:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
identify with why he was struggling and
 
04:21:08.389 --> 04:21:08.399 align:start position:0%
it wasn't until I requested an
 
04:21:10.130 --> 04:21:10.140 align:start position:0%
evaluation in sixth grade when he was
 
04:21:11.510 --> 04:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
finally identified
 
04:21:13.969 --> 04:21:13.979 align:start position:0%
our family sacrifice we sent him to a
 
04:21:15.650 --> 04:21:15.660 align:start position:0%
private high school that specialized in
 
04:21:17.330 --> 04:21:17.340 align:start position:0%
teaching students with language-based
 
04:21:18.950 --> 04:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
learning disabilities to get him the
 
04:21:21.229 --> 04:21:21.239 align:start position:0%
help he needed to succeed he was lucky
 
04:21:23.750 --> 04:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
because our family had the resources but
 
04:21:25.370 --> 04:21:25.380 align:start position:0%
most students aren't that lucky
 
04:21:27.290 --> 04:21:27.300 align:start position:0%
I don't blame those teachers who didn't
 
04:21:29.510 --> 04:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
understand his disability they were
 
04:21:31.610 --> 04:21:31.620 align:start position:0%
trying so hard to help him they just
 
04:21:33.710 --> 04:21:33.720 align:start position:0%
didn't know what they didn't know
 
04:21:37.010 --> 04:21:37.020 align:start position:0%
HB 377 is in support of Educators and
 
04:21:38.630 --> 04:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
getting them the help they need to
 
04:21:40.250 --> 04:21:40.260 align:start position:0%
support their students
 
04:21:42.769 --> 04:21:42.779 align:start position:0%
I'm here today to ask you to support HB
 
04:21:44.750 --> 04:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
377 the bill is basically a
 
04:21:46.790 --> 04:21:46.800 align:start position:0%
clarification of the current dyslexia
 
04:21:48.650 --> 04:21:48.660 align:start position:0%
law I was a member of the study
 
04:21:49.729 --> 04:21:49.739 align:start position:0%
committee who worked on the original
 
04:21:53.269 --> 04:21:53.279 align:start position:0%
draft and since the law was passed we
 
04:21:54.769 --> 04:21:54.779 align:start position:0%
have heard from any school personnel
 
04:21:56.809 --> 04:21:56.819 align:start position:0%
with questions on best practices on
 
04:21:59.030 --> 04:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
screening both timing and frequency and
 
04:22:01.610 --> 04:22:01.620 align:start position:0%
I know the doe also has heard a lot of
 
04:22:05.210 --> 04:22:05.220 align:start position:0%
these questions and the doe published a
 
04:22:06.950 --> 04:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
very good resource guide that is
 
04:22:09.349 --> 04:22:09.359 align:start position:0%
available on their website plus they did
 
04:22:10.670 --> 04:22:10.680 align:start position:0%
a lot of professional development
 
04:22:13.309 --> 04:22:13.319 align:start position:0%
sessions around the state and there are
 
04:22:15.950 --> 04:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
schools that are doing this the right
 
04:22:18.050 --> 04:22:18.060 align:start position:0%
way I had a long conversation with our
 
04:22:20.150 --> 04:22:20.160 align:start position:0%
curriculum directors in Kearsarge
 
04:22:22.130 --> 04:22:22.140 align:start position:0%
yesterday afternoon they are in full
 
04:22:25.429 --> 04:22:25.439 align:start position:0%
support of this bill they were have been
 
04:22:27.050 --> 04:22:27.060 align:start position:0%
working very hard over the last few
 
04:22:29.990 --> 04:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
years and putting in a process in place
 
04:22:33.110 --> 04:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
a protocol in place that follows what
 
04:22:36.189 --> 04:22:36.199 align:start position:0%
this bill is describing here
 
04:22:38.090 --> 04:22:38.100 align:start position:0%
representative ball talked about
 
04:22:39.889 --> 04:22:39.899 align:start position:0%
Fountains of Pennell and Lucy Calkins
 
04:22:42.229 --> 04:22:42.239 align:start position:0%
the secure search District was using
 
04:22:44.030 --> 04:22:44.040 align:start position:0%
reading recovery which is the Lucy
 
04:22:46.010 --> 04:22:46.020 align:start position:0%
culligans program they've thrown it out
 
04:22:49.070 --> 04:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
and they have been working very hard on
 
04:22:51.229 --> 04:22:51.239 align:start position:0%
redoing their curriculum when it comes
 
04:22:53.210 --> 04:22:53.220 align:start position:0%
to this stuff
 
04:22:53.220 --> 04:22:53.870 align:start position:0%
to this stuff
um

04:22:53.870 --> 04:22:53.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:59.090 --> 04:22:59.100 align:start position:0%
and I I especially am uh happy to see
 
04:23:01.309 --> 04:23:01.319 align:start position:0%
that the screening requirement is now
 
04:23:03.229 --> 04:23:03.239 align:start position:0%
going kindergarten through second grade
 
04:23:04.910 --> 04:23:04.920 align:start position:0%
you've already heard from people that
 
04:23:06.769 --> 04:23:06.779 align:start position:0%
have testified already how important it
 
04:23:09.050 --> 04:23:09.060 align:start position:0%
is to catch it as early as possible I
 
04:23:11.630 --> 04:23:11.640 align:start position:0%
don't need to repeat that all for you
 
04:23:14.570 --> 04:23:14.580 align:start position:0%
all over again but uh we've had
 
04:23:16.849 --> 04:23:16.859 align:start position:0%
questions in the past too of oh well
 
04:23:18.889 --> 04:23:18.899 align:start position:0%
I've I've screened in kindergarten now I
 
04:23:20.150 --> 04:23:20.160 align:start position:0%
don't have to screen again because
 
04:23:22.189 --> 04:23:22.199 align:start position:0%
that's what the law says because people
 
04:23:24.170 --> 04:23:24.180 align:start position:0%
didn't weren't reading it correctly so
 
04:23:26.510 --> 04:23:26.520 align:start position:0%
I'm confident that this amendment kind
 
04:23:28.429 --> 04:23:28.439 align:start position:0%
of tightens up that language to make it
 
04:23:30.290 --> 04:23:30.300 align:start position:0%
more clear that the screening really is
 
04:23:32.269 --> 04:23:32.279 align:start position:0%
necessary all the way through K through
 
04:23:35.389 --> 04:23:35.399 align:start position:0%
two in case it's missed it can be done
 
04:23:38.750 --> 04:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
and oh and and cancer District they're
 
04:23:40.370 --> 04:23:40.380 align:start position:0%
actually doing it more than twice a year
 
04:23:42.590 --> 04:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
and it depends on the tool the tool will
 
04:23:45.349 --> 04:23:45.359 align:start position:0%
specify how much time in between the
 
04:23:46.910 --> 04:23:46.920 align:start position:0%
screening should be done and how often
 
04:23:50.150 --> 04:23:50.160 align:start position:0%
it can be done to be done you know
 
04:23:54.170 --> 04:23:54.180 align:start position:0%
uh the correct way uh
 
04:23:56.150 --> 04:23:56.160 align:start position:0%
I don't I've submitted this testimony
 
04:23:58.189 --> 04:23:58.199 align:start position:0%
online I have copies if anybody wants it
 
04:23:59.630 --> 04:23:59.640 align:start position:0%
I just want to finish up because your
 
04:24:02.090 --> 04:24:02.100 align:start position:0%
time is very valuable with saying I am
 
04:24:04.670 --> 04:24:04.680 align:start position:0%
so grateful uh I was so grateful at the
 
04:24:05.990 --> 04:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
time when the original bill was support
 
04:24:09.889 --> 04:24:09.899 align:start position:0%
was filed with bipartisan support I am
 
04:24:11.929 --> 04:24:11.939 align:start position:0%
grateful today to representative kutab
 
04:24:14.570 --> 04:24:14.580 align:start position:0%
for introducing this bill and continuing
 
04:24:17.809 --> 04:24:17.819 align:start position:0%
with the bipartisan support progress has
 
04:24:19.189 --> 04:24:19.199 align:start position:0%
been made in many school districts
 
04:24:20.689 --> 04:24:20.699 align:start position:0%
throughout the state since the original
 
04:24:23.150 --> 04:24:23.160 align:start position:0%
law was passed the pandemic threw a
 
04:24:24.710 --> 04:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
monkey wrench into many things but I'm
 
04:24:26.330 --> 04:24:26.340 align:start position:0%
confident that this will help continue
 
04:24:28.790 --> 04:24:28.800 align:start position:0%
that progress and in the long run help
 
04:24:30.530 --> 04:24:30.540 align:start position:0%
so many students in the state become
 
04:24:32.290 --> 04:24:32.300 align:start position:0%
successful members of our communities
 
04:24:35.150 --> 04:24:35.160 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions thank you
 
04:24:37.010 --> 04:24:37.020 align:start position:0%
very much are there any questions
 
04:24:40.610 --> 04:24:40.620 align:start position:0%
from the committee thank you thank you
 
04:24:43.729 --> 04:24:43.739 align:start position:0%
uh next card I have here is Jen black
 
04:24:43.739 --> 04:24:45.769 align:start position:0%
uh next card I have here is Jen black
moth

04:24:45.769 --> 04:24:45.779 align:start position:0%
moth
 
04:24:49.790 --> 04:24:49.800 align:start position:0%
that production name correctly yeah
 
04:24:52.189 --> 04:24:52.199 align:start position:0%
hi I'm Jennifer blagriff I'm from
 
04:24:54.229 --> 04:24:54.239 align:start position:0%
Hopkinton New Hampshire and I'm one of
 
04:24:57.170 --> 04:24:57.180 align:start position:0%
the current decoding dyslexia State
 
04:24:59.269 --> 04:24:59.279 align:start position:0%
leaders so I'm grateful for that this
 
04:25:01.969 --> 04:25:01.979 align:start position:0%
bill was brought forward
 
04:25:04.490 --> 04:25:04.500 align:start position:0%
um myself and Allison Everhart are there
 
04:25:07.729 --> 04:25:07.739 align:start position:0%
two current decoding dyslexia leaders
 
04:25:12.290 --> 04:25:12.300 align:start position:0%
um I have four children my oldest is 13
 
04:25:15.950 --> 04:25:15.960 align:start position:0%
and he has dyslexia my second oldest is
 
04:25:19.250 --> 04:25:19.260 align:start position:0%
10 and she also has dyslexia
 
04:25:21.530 --> 04:25:21.540 align:start position:0%
um My Little second grader she's doing
 
04:25:23.689 --> 04:25:23.699 align:start position:0%
all right I've definitely seen the
 
04:25:25.550 --> 04:25:25.560 align:start position:0%
improvements in the school districts the
 
04:25:27.590 --> 04:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
school district that my kids are in they
 
04:25:30.110 --> 04:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
have really been embracing the science
 
04:25:32.269 --> 04:25:32.279 align:start position:0%
of reading and improving their teaching
 
04:25:34.070 --> 04:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
methods which has been absolutely
 
04:25:34.080 --> 04:25:35.510 align:start position:0%
methods which has been absolutely
wonderful

04:25:35.510 --> 04:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
wonderful
 
04:25:37.370 --> 04:25:37.380 align:start position:0%
um and then my little one is he's four
 
04:25:38.809 --> 04:25:38.819 align:start position:0%
so I don't know he has some potential
 
04:25:41.330 --> 04:25:41.340 align:start position:0%
red flags we'll see what happens
 
04:25:43.070 --> 04:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
um so
 
04:25:45.229 --> 04:25:45.239 align:start position:0%
um I submitted this testimony and I have
 
04:25:47.149 --> 04:25:47.159 align:start position:0%
some copies here
 
04:25:49.550 --> 04:25:49.560 align:start position:0%
um so I'll just read a little bit from
 
04:25:51.110 --> 04:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
the letter
 
04:25:53.630 --> 04:25:53.640 align:start position:0%
um so well Allison and I are very much
 
04:25:55.729 --> 04:25:55.739 align:start position:0%
in support of the improvements offered
 
04:25:59.689 --> 04:25:59.699 align:start position:0%
by HB 377 FN we strongly recommend
 
04:26:01.490 --> 04:26:01.500 align:start position:0%
further changes to this bill at this
 
04:26:03.830 --> 04:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
time including the following that the
 
04:26:07.269 --> 04:26:07.279 align:start position:0%
screening tool include a test of Rapid
 
04:26:11.030 --> 04:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
automized naming or ran the screening be
 
04:26:13.250 --> 04:26:13.260 align:start position:0%
implemented through the third grade year
 
04:26:15.889 --> 04:26:15.899 align:start position:0%
and that parents and Guardians receive
 
04:26:17.410 --> 04:26:17.420 align:start position:0%
screening results
 
04:26:19.969 --> 04:26:19.979 align:start position:0%
so it's critical that this will be
 
04:26:22.910 --> 04:26:22.920 align:start position:0%
expanded to specifically state that the
 
04:26:25.370 --> 04:26:25.380 align:start position:0%
screener include ran ran is a strong
 
04:26:27.550 --> 04:26:27.560 align:start position:0%
predictor of future reading difficulty
 
04:26:30.530 --> 04:26:30.540 align:start position:0%
across different ages ability levels and
 
04:26:32.030 --> 04:26:32.040 align:start position:0%
languages and we have a reference on
 
04:26:34.189 --> 04:26:34.199 align:start position:0%
here for you guys and so it is a key
 
04:26:36.469 --> 04:26:36.479 align:start position:0%
component a component of any early
 
04:26:38.630 --> 04:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
literacy screening and I believe the
 
04:26:42.349 --> 04:26:42.359 align:start position:0%
dipples 8 does have ran as a component
 
04:26:44.630 --> 04:26:44.640 align:start position:0%
um second secondly this bill must
 
04:26:46.490 --> 04:26:46.500 align:start position:0%
address the third grade year we feel
 
04:26:48.469 --> 04:26:48.479 align:start position:0%
very strongly about about this as
 
04:26:50.510 --> 04:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
parents and from things we've heard from
 
04:26:52.250 --> 04:26:52.260 align:start position:0%
other parents that third grade year we
 
04:26:53.990 --> 04:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
still need to be doing screening at this
 
04:26:56.389 --> 04:26:56.399 align:start position:0%
point in time
 
04:26:58.309 --> 04:26:58.319 align:start position:0%
so while many school districts in New
 
04:26:59.630 --> 04:26:59.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are improving the weights of
 
04:27:02.030 --> 04:27:02.040 align:start position:0%
fail model is still present it is often
 
04:27:03.889 --> 04:27:03.899 align:start position:0%
not until the third grade year after
 
04:27:05.689 --> 04:27:05.699 align:start position:0%
that children are identified as having
 
04:27:07.610 --> 04:27:07.620 align:start position:0%
significant enough difficulties to
 
04:27:09.649 --> 04:27:09.659 align:start position:0%
Warrant concern often requiring
 
04:27:11.450 --> 04:27:11.460 align:start position:0%
intervention that is more intensive and
 
04:27:13.790 --> 04:27:13.800 align:start position:0%
thus more costly well while we
 
04:27:15.229 --> 04:27:15.239 align:start position:0%
understand this bill is designed to help
 
04:27:17.389 --> 04:27:17.399 align:start position:0%
address this issue the bill must include
 
04:27:19.610 --> 04:27:19.620 align:start position:0%
the third grade year given the critical
 
04:27:21.950 --> 04:27:21.960 align:start position:0%
needs of identifying reading challenges
 
04:27:24.469 --> 04:27:24.479 align:start position:0%
by third grade so we have great concerns
 
04:27:26.450 --> 04:27:26.460 align:start position:0%
that there will still unfortunately be
 
04:27:29.030 --> 04:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
kids missed in that kindergarten first
 
04:27:31.130 --> 04:27:31.140 align:start position:0%
and second grade year as systematic
 
04:27:33.729 --> 04:27:33.739 align:start position:0%
change takes time to happen
 
04:27:36.290 --> 04:27:36.300 align:start position:0%
and even though this bill could greatly
 
04:27:37.969 --> 04:27:37.979 align:start position:0%
improve things through second grade I
 
04:27:39.590 --> 04:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
there's that third grade year is
 
04:27:41.530 --> 04:27:41.540 align:start position:0%
critical at this point
 
04:27:44.269 --> 04:27:44.279 align:start position:0%
lastly this bill needs to explicitly
 
04:27:45.950 --> 04:27:45.960 align:start position:0%
state that all parents and Guardians
 
04:27:47.750 --> 04:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
receive the results of screening so that
 
04:27:49.189 --> 04:27:49.199 align:start position:0%
needs to be spelled out very clearly
 
04:27:51.590 --> 04:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
that it is all parents
 
04:27:53.870 --> 04:27:53.880 align:start position:0%
um and that it should also be spelled
 
04:27:55.849 --> 04:27:55.859 align:start position:0%
out that it should be sent home with the
 
04:27:58.130 --> 04:27:58.140 align:start position:0%
next report card with an explanation of
 
04:28:00.469 --> 04:28:00.479 align:start position:0%
the screening tool or tools used it is
 
04:28:01.610 --> 04:28:01.620 align:start position:0%
critical that parents have an
 
04:28:03.170 --> 04:28:03.180 align:start position:0%
understanding of the screenings being
 
04:28:05.330 --> 04:28:05.340 align:start position:0%
conducted as well as how their children
 
04:28:07.070 --> 04:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
are performing on these screenings in
 
04:28:08.630 --> 04:28:08.640 align:start position:0%
order to be able to support their
 
04:28:11.630 --> 04:28:11.640 align:start position:0%
children as readers lots of parents do
 
04:28:14.630 --> 04:28:14.640 align:start position:0%
not realize until it's in a sense too
 
04:28:17.210 --> 04:28:17.220 align:start position:0%
late that their kids were struggling
 
04:28:20.809 --> 04:28:20.819 align:start position:0%
earlier on so it's the parents are you
 
04:28:22.610 --> 04:28:22.620 align:start position:0%
know the key person to really understand
 
04:28:25.790 --> 04:28:25.800 align:start position:0%
how these kiddos are doing and they
 
04:28:27.590 --> 04:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
really should know what those screening
 
04:28:30.290 --> 04:28:30.300 align:start position:0%
results are from the beginning to the
 
04:28:30.300 --> 04:28:31.370 align:start position:0%
results are from the beginning to the
end

04:28:31.370 --> 04:28:31.380 align:start position:0%
end
 
04:28:31.380 --> 04:28:31.969 align:start position:0%
end
um

04:28:31.969 --> 04:28:31.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:28:33.889 --> 04:28:33.899 align:start position:0%
so we feel these suggested changes will
 
04:28:35.330 --> 04:28:35.340 align:start position:0%
have significant impacts and will
 
04:28:37.450 --> 04:28:37.460 align:start position:0%
require a little additional cost if any
 
04:28:39.710 --> 04:28:39.720 align:start position:0%
long-term savings will occur over time
 
04:28:41.330 --> 04:28:41.340 align:start position:0%
as students are identified an
 
04:28:42.849 --> 04:28:42.859 align:start position:0%
intervention is implemented early
 
04:28:44.990 --> 04:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
avoiding the way to fail model will
 
04:28:46.729 --> 04:28:46.739 align:start position:0%
result in decreased costs and fewer
 
04:28:48.590 --> 04:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
students referred for special education
 
04:28:51.370 --> 04:28:51.380 align:start position:0%
which as you likely all know special ed
 
04:28:54.250 --> 04:28:54.260 align:start position:0%
involves a lot of um you know man
 
04:28:57.710 --> 04:28:57.720 align:start position:0%
Manpower time and money
 
04:28:57.720 --> 04:28:58.370 align:start position:0%
Manpower time and money
um

04:28:58.370 --> 04:28:58.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:29:00.590 --> 04:29:00.600 align:start position:0%
and then New Hampshire is definitely in
 
04:29:02.870 --> 04:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
an exciting period of transition where
 
04:29:04.550 --> 04:29:04.560 align:start position:0%
many teachers are fully embracing the
 
04:29:06.110 --> 04:29:06.120 align:start position:0%
science of reading to teach all children
 
04:29:07.189 --> 04:29:07.199 align:start position:0%
to read
 
04:29:08.990 --> 04:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
and critical to that is the
 
04:29:11.510 --> 04:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
implementation of Dyslexia screening
 
04:29:13.790 --> 04:29:13.800 align:start position:0%
tools that follow reading science best
 
04:29:16.610 --> 04:29:16.620 align:start position:0%
practices we're grateful for your work
 
04:29:18.649 --> 04:29:18.659 align:start position:0%
to improve our state dyslexia
 
04:29:20.689 --> 04:29:20.699 align:start position:0%
legislation and ask that you add the
 
04:29:23.090 --> 04:29:23.100 align:start position:0%
requested changes to further align with
 
04:29:25.309 --> 04:29:25.319 align:start position:0%
the reading science evidence to better
 
04:29:26.809 --> 04:29:26.819 align:start position:0%
support New Hampshire student learning
 
04:29:29.149 --> 04:29:29.159 align:start position:0%
and build their Pathways to success and
 
04:29:30.410 --> 04:29:30.420 align:start position:0%
then at the bottom we just have
 
04:29:33.769 --> 04:29:33.779 align:start position:0%
highlighted our suggestions of how this
 
04:29:37.070 --> 04:29:37.080 align:start position:0%
bill could be further improved thank you
 
04:29:39.469 --> 04:29:39.479 align:start position:0%
very much are there any questions from
 
04:29:40.670 --> 04:29:40.680 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
04:29:43.250 --> 04:29:43.260 align:start position:0%
MPS rips in Woodcock thank you chairman
 
04:29:44.870 --> 04:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thank you for coming in
 
04:29:47.389 --> 04:29:47.399 align:start position:0%
thanks and providing your information uh
 
04:29:50.630 --> 04:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
what grade does the Rand become a useful
 
04:29:52.790 --> 04:29:52.800 align:start position:0%
test I actually do not know the answer
 
04:29:54.889 --> 04:29:54.899 align:start position:0%
to that as a parent there might be
 
04:29:57.469 --> 04:29:57.479 align:start position:0%
someone that could I believe it's I mean
 
04:29:59.750 --> 04:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
my guess is it's through the grades I
 
04:30:01.189 --> 04:30:01.199 align:start position:0%
think it's a normal thing that my kids
 
04:30:02.689 --> 04:30:02.699 align:start position:0%
have had even when they've been tested
 
04:30:04.429 --> 04:30:04.439 align:start position:0%
older as a part of special ed testing
 
04:30:06.950 --> 04:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
but that's just a guess thank you thank
 
04:30:09.530 --> 04:30:09.540 align:start position:0%
you thank you for the questions
 
04:30:11.210 --> 04:30:11.220 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and the reference on
 
04:30:13.490 --> 04:30:13.500 align:start position:0%
there may explain that
 
04:30:20.750 --> 04:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:22.849 --> 04:30:22.859 align:start position:0%
thank you and hello to the education
 
04:30:24.530 --> 04:30:24.540 align:start position:0%
committee I am representative Lauren
 
04:30:26.929 --> 04:30:26.939 align:start position:0%
selig from Durham New Hampshire
 
04:30:28.729 --> 04:30:28.739 align:start position:0%
um and you were one of the Committees I
 
04:30:30.050 --> 04:30:30.060 align:start position:0%
did not get appointed to but was hoping
 
04:30:32.210 --> 04:30:32.220 align:start position:0%
for so um I thank you for having the
 
04:30:34.309 --> 04:30:34.319 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak before you
 
04:30:36.830 --> 04:30:36.840 align:start position:0%
um I am a former teacher I started my
 
04:30:38.750 --> 04:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
career teaching kindergarten in a
 
04:30:40.490 --> 04:30:40.500 align:start position:0%
setting where we
 
04:30:42.710 --> 04:30:42.720 align:start position:0%
um the first school where I taught was
 
04:30:44.929 --> 04:30:44.939 align:start position:0%
uh pseudo Montessori
 
04:30:47.570 --> 04:30:47.580 align:start position:0%
um and then I moved to a school where we
 
04:30:50.149 --> 04:30:50.159 align:start position:0%
team taught and I was the person in
 
04:30:51.410 --> 04:30:51.420 align:start position:0%
charge of teaching reading to our
 
04:30:51.420 --> 04:30:52.849 align:start position:0%
charge of teaching reading to our
kindergartners

04:30:52.849 --> 04:30:52.859 align:start position:0%
kindergartners
 
04:30:55.670 --> 04:30:55.680 align:start position:0%
um my co-teacher taught all the math not
 
04:30:57.410 --> 04:30:57.420 align:start position:0%
surprisingly we discovered that by doing
 
04:30:58.910 --> 04:30:58.920 align:start position:0%
one-on-one reading instruction every
 
04:31:00.410 --> 04:31:00.420 align:start position:0%
child was able to learn to read it his
 
04:31:02.330 --> 04:31:02.340 align:start position:0%
or her best rate because he or she got
 
04:31:05.030 --> 04:31:05.040 align:start position:0%
it at the style and method which worked
 
04:31:06.649 --> 04:31:06.659 align:start position:0%
best for them
 
04:31:08.870 --> 04:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
um additionally I then went to Johns
 
04:31:10.429 --> 04:31:10.439 align:start position:0%
Hopkins University in Baltimore to get a
 
04:31:12.710 --> 04:31:12.720 align:start position:0%
master's degree in education
 
04:31:14.030 --> 04:31:14.040 align:start position:0%
um while I was there the city of
 
04:31:15.649 --> 04:31:15.659 align:start position:0%
Baltimore expended five million dollars
 
04:31:17.929 --> 04:31:17.939 align:start position:0%
to conduct a study on reading and
 
04:31:19.969 --> 04:31:19.979 align:start position:0%
literacy and discovered that children
 
04:31:22.610 --> 04:31:22.620 align:start position:0%
who are taught one-on-one or in small
 
04:31:23.990 --> 04:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
groups learn to read faster than
 
04:31:25.910 --> 04:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
students who don't really really
 
04:31:25.920 --> 04:31:27.550 align:start position:0%
students who don't really really
surprising

04:31:27.550 --> 04:31:27.560 align:start position:0%
surprising
 
04:31:30.830 --> 04:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
but I also am the parent of two
 
04:31:32.570 --> 04:31:32.580 align:start position:0%
dramatically different children one of
 
04:31:35.809 --> 04:31:35.819 align:start position:0%
my daughters began reading when she was
 
04:31:37.429 --> 04:31:37.439 align:start position:0%
three and a half
 
04:31:39.349 --> 04:31:39.359 align:start position:0%
um we were out and about and she's like
 
04:31:42.769 --> 04:31:42.779 align:start position:0%
look Mommy there is Matt I was like what
 
04:31:44.870 --> 04:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
and she pointed and the word Matt was on
 
04:31:46.490 --> 04:31:46.500 align:start position:0%
you know some sign
 
04:31:47.990 --> 04:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
um and so it was a race to keep up with
 
04:31:50.210 --> 04:31:50.220 align:start position:0%
her and her reading ability
 
04:31:52.370 --> 04:31:52.380 align:start position:0%
um my other daughter however at age
 
04:31:54.649 --> 04:31:54.659 align:start position:0%
three still couldn't identify the M on
 
04:31:57.410 --> 04:31:57.420 align:start position:0%
the big yellow signs that we all see as
 
04:31:59.210 --> 04:31:59.220 align:start position:0%
we drive down the highway and didn't
 
04:32:01.550 --> 04:32:01.560 align:start position:0%
recognize that letter she also couldn't
 
04:32:02.870 --> 04:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
recognize the first letter of her first
 
04:32:04.790 --> 04:32:04.800 align:start position:0%
name which I didn't expect her to know
 
04:32:06.170 --> 04:32:06.180 align:start position:0%
the alphabet at three but I did think
 
04:32:07.490 --> 04:32:07.500 align:start position:0%
she would recognize the first letter of
 
04:32:09.110 --> 04:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
her first name
 
04:32:10.729 --> 04:32:10.739 align:start position:0%
um because I'm a former teacher because
 
04:32:13.010 --> 04:32:13.020 align:start position:0%
I had worked teaching children to read
 
04:32:14.809 --> 04:32:14.819 align:start position:0%
it was clear to me that we had a
 
04:32:17.030 --> 04:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
challenge with her learning and we also
 
04:32:19.490 --> 04:32:19.500 align:start position:0%
live in a district that Prides itself on
 
04:32:20.990 --> 04:32:21.000 align:start position:0%
the special education services as it
 
04:32:22.250 --> 04:32:22.260 align:start position:0%
gives to others
 
04:32:24.469 --> 04:32:24.479 align:start position:0%
despite all that I had to fight and
 
04:32:25.849 --> 04:32:25.859 align:start position:0%
fight and fight our school district to
 
04:32:27.229 --> 04:32:27.239 align:start position:0%
have her evaluated for any kind of
 
04:32:29.170 --> 04:32:29.180 align:start position:0%
learning disability at all
 
04:32:31.910 --> 04:32:31.920 align:start position:0%
and ultimately I was successful but only
 
04:32:33.349 --> 04:32:33.359 align:start position:0%
with the support of teachers who are
 
04:32:35.750 --> 04:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
willing to go to bat and fight with me
 
04:32:38.149 --> 04:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
um and she has incredibly amazingly
 
04:32:40.429 --> 04:32:40.439 align:start position:0%
smart and funny and Savvy young person
 
04:32:43.370 --> 04:32:43.380 align:start position:0%
but she also lost from kindergarten
 
04:32:44.689 --> 04:32:44.699 align:start position:0%
until halfway through third grade
 
04:32:46.370 --> 04:32:46.380 align:start position:0%
without being able to read effectively
 
04:32:48.410 --> 04:32:48.420 align:start position:0%
because it wasn't until she was halfway
 
04:32:49.729 --> 04:32:49.739 align:start position:0%
through second grade that we discovered
 
04:32:52.330 --> 04:32:52.340 align:start position:0%
her eyes did not track properly
 
04:32:55.370 --> 04:32:55.380 align:start position:0%
and my mortification the day that she
 
04:32:57.110 --> 04:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
said to me mommy did you know that trees
 
04:32:59.149 --> 04:32:59.159 align:start position:0%
have individual leaves
 
04:33:02.389 --> 04:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
was awful as a parent to have my child
 
04:33:04.789 --> 04:33:04.799 align:start position:0%
be almost eight years old and not have
 
04:33:07.551 --> 04:33:07.561 align:start position:0%
realized that that green blob was
 
04:33:09.769 --> 04:33:09.779 align:start position:0%
individual separated leaves and it
 
04:33:11.510 --> 04:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
wasn't for my lack of trying to have her
 
04:33:13.250 --> 04:33:13.260 align:start position:0%
evaluated but part of that was
 
04:33:15.590 --> 04:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
age-appropriate mess so I've heard a
 
04:33:16.609 --> 04:33:16.619 align:start position:0%
number of people talk about the
 
04:33:17.869 --> 04:33:17.879 align:start position:0%
importance of extending this bill
 
04:33:19.970 --> 04:33:19.980 align:start position:0%
through Kinder through third grade
 
04:33:21.949 --> 04:33:21.959 align:start position:0%
I think really we need to continue to
 
04:33:24.470 --> 04:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
offer some form of testing whether it's
 
04:33:26.150 --> 04:33:26.160 align:start position:0%
opt-in all the way through the
 
04:33:27.769 --> 04:33:27.779 align:start position:0%
elementary years and probably into the
 
04:33:30.170 --> 04:33:30.180 align:start position:0%
middle school years so that we are
 
04:33:31.730 --> 04:33:31.740 align:start position:0%
catching a lot of these visual
 
04:33:34.250 --> 04:33:34.260 align:start position:0%
disruptions I don't agree that phonics
 
04:33:35.510 --> 04:33:35.520 align:start position:0%
is the only way to teach children to
 
04:33:36.709 --> 04:33:36.719 align:start position:0%
read There are some children for whom
 
04:33:38.810 --> 04:33:38.820 align:start position:0%
that is incredibly successful there are
 
04:33:39.890 --> 04:33:39.900 align:start position:0%
some children who don't process
 
04:33:41.631 --> 04:33:41.641 align:start position:0%
auditorily and that's never going to be
 
04:33:43.250 --> 04:33:43.260 align:start position:0%
a successful method for them we need to
 
04:33:45.289 --> 04:33:45.299 align:start position:0%
be able to offer varieties but I think
 
04:33:48.051 --> 04:33:48.061 align:start position:0%
it's important to use this to use tools
 
04:33:50.410 --> 04:33:50.420 align:start position:0%
like this bill to expand it Beyond
 
04:33:53.150 --> 04:33:53.160 align:start position:0%
second grade and to look for ways that
 
04:33:54.769 --> 04:33:54.779 align:start position:0%
we can really be evaluating all of our
 
04:33:56.631 --> 04:33:56.641 align:start position:0%
children to see how they learn and to
 
04:33:58.250 --> 04:33:58.260 align:start position:0%
support their learning best
 
04:34:01.970 --> 04:34:01.980 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there questions
 
04:34:03.769 --> 04:34:03.779 align:start position:0%
not seeing me thank you thank you very
 
04:34:06.470 --> 04:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
much thank you you're welcome and the
 
04:34:08.090 --> 04:34:08.100 align:start position:0%
last pink parrot I have is Kathleen
 
04:34:08.100 --> 04:34:14.109 align:start position:0%
last pink parrot I have is Kathleen
McCaffrey

04:34:14.109 --> 04:34:14.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:16.849 --> 04:34:16.859 align:start position:0%
okay that's
 
04:34:19.429 --> 04:34:19.439 align:start position:0%
so I'm Kathleen McCaffrey I'm here to
 
04:34:20.990 --> 04:34:21.000 align:start position:0%
answer any questions from the Department
 
04:34:24.709 --> 04:34:24.719 align:start position:0%
of Education I've worked 12 years in an
 
04:34:26.631 --> 04:34:26.641 align:start position:0%
elementary school setting seven years in
 
04:34:29.330 --> 04:34:29.340 align:start position:0%
a clinical setting with neurodiversity
 
04:34:31.970 --> 04:34:31.980 align:start position:0%
students testing and additionally I'm
 
04:34:34.070 --> 04:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
getting a PhD in orthographic mapping
 
04:34:36.109 --> 04:34:36.119 align:start position:0%
from Northeastern University
 
04:34:38.090 --> 04:34:38.100 align:start position:0%
so any questions you have regarding the
 
04:34:40.609 --> 04:34:40.619 align:start position:0%
bill I can maybe answer
 
04:34:42.529 --> 04:34:42.539 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
04:34:44.090 --> 04:34:44.100 align:start position:0%
well there are a few hands over here
 
04:34:46.910 --> 04:34:46.920 align:start position:0%
representative Drive okay thank you for
 
04:34:48.830 --> 04:34:48.840 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chairman and thank you for taking
 
04:34:50.689 --> 04:34:50.699 align:start position:0%
this um I'm going to ask the question I
 
04:34:53.689 --> 04:34:53.699 align:start position:0%
did before which is if we use the um the
 
04:34:57.289 --> 04:34:57.299 align:start position:0%
tool recommended in the bill to test and
 
04:35:00.410 --> 04:35:00.420 align:start position:0%
and ramp up our number of tests um is
 
04:35:01.910 --> 04:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
there a cost to that
 
04:35:04.070 --> 04:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
so that's an interesting question I
 
04:35:06.769 --> 04:35:06.779 align:start position:0%
reached out to Matt Burns who works at
 
04:35:09.709 --> 04:35:09.719 align:start position:0%
the University of Missouri education and
 
04:35:11.570 --> 04:35:11.580 align:start position:0%
he's done longitudinal studies on
 
04:35:13.429 --> 04:35:13.439 align:start position:0%
screeners and there's a variety of
 
04:35:15.709 --> 04:35:15.719 align:start position:0%
screeners that are zero cost that he
 
04:35:17.269 --> 04:35:17.279 align:start position:0%
does recommend including the Dibbles
 
04:35:18.949 --> 04:35:18.959 align:start position:0%
versus there's two different forms of
 
04:35:21.709 --> 04:35:21.719 align:start position:0%
Dibbles which you asked so it depends on
 
04:35:23.990 --> 04:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
the type of screener I guess that the
 
04:35:25.789 --> 04:35:25.799 align:start position:0%
school district would choose and that's
 
04:35:27.650 --> 04:35:27.660 align:start position:0%
why it's indeterminable because it
 
04:35:30.109 --> 04:35:30.119 align:start position:0%
depends again we're local control and
 
04:35:32.330 --> 04:35:32.340 align:start position:0%
the districts can choose what they would
 
04:35:34.490 --> 04:35:34.500 align:start position:0%
like to use
 
04:35:37.670 --> 04:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
yes the statue really conflicts this
 
04:35:39.349 --> 04:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
whole thing when districts have total
 
04:35:41.209 --> 04:35:41.219 align:start position:0%
authority over instruction and
 
04:35:44.150 --> 04:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
curriculum what they use it's not a
 
04:35:46.609 --> 04:35:46.619 align:start position:0%
mandate down from us uh for
 
04:35:48.051 --> 04:35:48.061 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher do you also have
 
04:35:49.849 --> 04:35:49.859 align:start position:0%
your hand up
 
04:35:52.131 --> 04:35:52.141 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair just to seek further
 
04:35:53.929 --> 04:35:53.939 align:start position:0%
clarification I'll I'll ask you the same
 
04:35:56.209 --> 04:35:56.219 align:start position:0%
question I asked earlier which is
 
04:35:58.131 --> 04:35:58.141 align:start position:0%
um of course all tests being imperfect
 
04:36:00.189 --> 04:36:00.199 align:start position:0%
do we have any information regarding
 
04:36:03.109 --> 04:36:03.119 align:start position:0%
rates of possible false positives for
 
04:36:05.269 --> 04:36:05.279 align:start position:0%
many of these tests all tests have false
 
04:36:07.369 --> 04:36:07.379 align:start position:0%
positives in fact I was looking at Matt
 
04:36:09.289 --> 04:36:09.299 align:start position:0%
Burns study when you asked that question
 
04:36:11.390 --> 04:36:11.400 align:start position:0%
and he does say that and he recommends
 
04:36:14.449 --> 04:36:14.459 align:start position:0%
using a variety of different tests in
 
04:36:16.670 --> 04:36:16.680 align:start position:0%
order to get rid of false positives some
 
04:36:18.769 --> 04:36:18.779 align:start position:0%
tests again are free but he does say
 
04:36:20.810 --> 04:36:20.820 align:start position:0%
that there is always going to be false
 
04:36:23.330 --> 04:36:23.340 align:start position:0%
positives on tests and he has done again
 
04:36:25.131 --> 04:36:25.141 align:start position:0%
five years longitudinal data I'm happy
 
04:36:26.949 --> 04:36:26.959 align:start position:0%
to give you this articles afterwards
 
04:36:32.510 --> 04:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:34.910 --> 04:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
does the department take a position on
 
04:36:37.551 --> 04:36:37.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:41.631 --> 04:36:41.641 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:44.449 --> 04:36:44.459 align:start position:0%
are there further questions
 
04:36:48.289 --> 04:36:48.299 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:52.131 --> 04:36:52.141 align:start position:0%
so this closes this hearing and we will
 
04:36:54.470 --> 04:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
get ready here to open up the next
 
04:36:56.689 --> 04:36:56.699 align:start position:0%
hearing which we have today is
 
04:36:59.029 --> 04:36:59.039 align:start position:0%
um 429 requiring the offering of
 
04:37:01.369 --> 04:37:01.379 align:start position:0%
breakfast and lunch in all public and
 
04:37:05.570 --> 04:37:05.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:07.010 --> 04:37:07.020 align:start position:0%
take a little bit of a stretch here
 
04:37:08.810 --> 04:37:08.820 align:start position:0%
folks and we'll start this up in about a
 
04:37:12.609 --> 04:37:12.619 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:16.131 --> 04:37:16.141 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:16.141 --> 04:37:24.551 align:start position:0%
 
yes

04:37:24.551 --> 04:37:24.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:27.349 --> 04:37:27.359 align:start position:0%
Sue how are you doing
 
04:37:27.359 --> 04:37:32.269 align:start position:0%
Sue how are you doing
foreign

04:37:32.269 --> 04:37:32.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:32.279 --> 04:41:05.510 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:41:05.510 --> 04:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:08.330 --> 04:41:08.340 align:start position:0%
of course I do not have art Allison have
 
04:41:13.730 --> 04:41:13.740 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:13.740 --> 04:41:17.948 align:start position:0%
 
y

04:41:17.948 --> 04:41:17.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:21.410 --> 04:41:21.420 align:start position:0%
chips so there's two hours behind so I
 
04:41:24.368 --> 04:41:24.378 align:start position:0%
will step out when they text me but okay
 
04:41:34.628 --> 04:41:34.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:38.868 --> 04:41:38.878 align:start position:0%
this looks like 29 on radio right
 
04:41:45.770 --> 04:41:45.780 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:47.750 --> 04:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to go ahead now and start
 
04:41:51.708 --> 04:41:51.718 align:start position:0%
with HP 429 429 is a bill requiring
 
04:41:53.628 --> 04:41:53.638 align:start position:0%
offering of breakfast and lunch in all
 
04:41:55.910 --> 04:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
public and Charter Public Schools
 
04:41:59.990 --> 04:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
Welcome to our committee representative
 
04:42:00.000 --> 04:42:01.270 align:start position:0%
Welcome to our committee representative
Allison

04:42:01.270 --> 04:42:01.280 align:start position:0%
Allison
 
04:42:04.368 --> 04:42:04.378 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
04:42:07.990 --> 04:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
members of this esteemed committee uh
 
04:42:11.628 --> 04:42:11.638 align:start position:0%
I will be introducing House Bill 429 FM
 
04:42:15.110 --> 04:42:15.120 align:start position:0%
local uh the intent of the bill is to
 
04:42:16.910 --> 04:42:16.920 align:start position:0%
decrease the number of students in New
 
04:42:18.350 --> 04:42:18.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Public Schools who come to
 
04:42:20.750 --> 04:42:20.760 align:start position:0%
school hungry and to provide a level of
 
04:42:22.250 --> 04:42:22.260 align:start position:0%
nutrition to those students that will
 
04:42:23.690 --> 04:42:23.700 align:start position:0%
allow them to be successful in their
 
04:42:27.470 --> 04:42:27.480 align:start position:0%
classrooms a change from what uh you
 
04:42:29.448 --> 04:42:29.458 align:start position:0%
will have well I mentioned it in my
 
04:42:31.610 --> 04:42:31.620 align:start position:0%
testimony but there will be Amendment
 
04:42:33.530 --> 04:42:33.540 align:start position:0%
forthcoming which will pull charter
 
04:42:36.110 --> 04:42:36.120 align:start position:0%
schools out out of this bill
 
04:42:38.628 --> 04:42:38.638 align:start position:0%
and we will address that in in future
 
04:42:41.990 --> 04:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
legislation so the bill as amended will
 
04:42:43.788 --> 04:42:43.798 align:start position:0%
require every public school in the state
 
04:42:45.350 --> 04:42:45.360 align:start position:0%
to participate in the federal breakfast
 
04:42:50.448 --> 04:42:50.458 align:start position:0%
lunch program under RSA 189 2A this bill
 
04:42:53.628 --> 04:42:53.638 align:start position:0%
is a result of over two years of work by
 
04:42:55.970 --> 04:42:55.980 align:start position:0%
members of this committee uh former
 
04:43:00.230 --> 04:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
members of this committee uh who spent
 
04:43:03.470 --> 04:43:03.480 align:start position:0%
lots of time with research a study
 
04:43:06.770 --> 04:43:06.780 align:start position:0%
committee uh gen 404 from our committee
 
04:43:08.448 --> 04:43:08.458 align:start position:0%
provided us with lots and lots of
 
04:43:08.458 --> 04:43:09.310 align:start position:0%
provided us with lots and lots of
information

04:43:09.310 --> 04:43:09.320 align:start position:0%
information
 
04:43:13.730 --> 04:43:13.740 align:start position:0%
uh that committee was ably led by
 
04:43:16.868 --> 04:43:16.878 align:start position:0%
representative Sue Mullen who has that
 
04:43:19.310 --> 04:43:19.320 align:start position:0%
knows probably more about this topic
 
04:43:21.410 --> 04:43:21.420 align:start position:0%
than almost anyone else and she'll be
 
04:43:22.970 --> 04:43:22.980 align:start position:0%
testifying today
 
04:43:25.128 --> 04:43:25.138 align:start position:0%
this is the first in a number of bills
 
04:43:26.990 --> 04:43:27.000 align:start position:0%
that will come here into other health
 
04:43:30.410 --> 04:43:30.420 align:start position:0%
committees related to reducing hunger in
 
04:43:31.970 --> 04:43:31.980 align:start position:0%
our for our children
 
04:43:33.708 --> 04:43:33.718 align:start position:0%
our research in this area is
 
04:43:35.448 --> 04:43:35.458 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly supportive of the link
 
04:43:37.190 --> 04:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
between student learning gains and
 
04:43:38.590 --> 04:43:38.600 align:start position:0%
healthy meals
 
04:43:41.208 --> 04:43:41.218 align:start position:0%
there's a growing support for vastly

free School meals for all students in
 
04:44:00.530 --> 04:44:00.540 align:start position:0%
addition we have multiple reports that
 
04:44:03.650 --> 04:44:03.660 align:start position:0%
provided to us from Jen which relate to
 
04:44:05.570 --> 04:44:05.580 align:start position:0%
significant progress that's being made
 
04:44:07.730 --> 04:44:07.740 align:start position:0%
in this area in the surrounding states
 
04:44:10.810 --> 04:44:10.820 align:start position:0%
of Massachusetts Maine and Vermont
 
04:44:13.368 --> 04:44:13.378 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire we often are not
 
04:44:15.890 --> 04:44:15.900 align:start position:0%
swayed by national surveys or what other
 
04:44:17.510 --> 04:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
states might be doing on a particular
 
04:44:20.270 --> 04:44:20.280 align:start position:0%
topic we try to stay focused on the best
 
04:44:21.890 --> 04:44:21.900 align:start position:0%
interests of our children
 
04:44:24.410 --> 04:44:24.420 align:start position:0%
child hunger is not a republican nor a
 
04:44:26.930 --> 04:44:26.940 align:start position:0%
democratic issue it is certainly within
 
04:44:28.490 --> 04:44:28.500 align:start position:0%
the responsibility of this committee
 
04:44:30.948 --> 04:44:30.958 align:start position:0%
when hungry children cannot learn to
 
04:44:33.590 --> 04:44:33.600 align:start position:0%
take even more even small measured steps
 
04:44:35.990 --> 04:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
toward improving their educational lives
 
04:44:38.690 --> 04:44:38.700 align:start position:0%
but it is it is even more important
 
04:44:40.610 --> 04:44:40.620 align:start position:0%
particularly for children to meet their
 
04:44:43.330 --> 04:44:43.340 align:start position:0%
most basic human need no more hunger
 
04:44:45.470 --> 04:44:45.480 align:start position:0%
I hope the committee will ultimately
 
04:44:48.230 --> 04:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
debate and vote to move this floor bill
 
04:44:50.690 --> 04:44:50.700 align:start position:0%
as amended to the house floor without to
 
04:44:53.570 --> 04:44:53.580 align:start position:0%
pass recommendation I I would add you
 
04:44:55.610 --> 04:44:55.620 align:start position:0%
have a you have information relating
 
04:44:57.250 --> 04:44:57.260 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Education
 
04:45:00.410 --> 04:45:00.420 align:start position:0%
relating to the number of of schools
 
04:45:03.830 --> 04:45:03.840 align:start position:0%
that this might affect we receive very
 
04:45:05.750 --> 04:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
recent information in the last 45
 
04:45:10.430 --> 04:45:10.440 align:start position:0%
minutes to clarify this uh there are six
 
04:45:12.708 --> 04:45:12.718 align:start position:0%
schools six public schools in the state
 
04:45:14.750 --> 04:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire that currently do not
 
04:45:17.270 --> 04:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
provide breakfast and lunch through the
 
04:45:18.470 --> 04:45:18.480 align:start position:0%
federal program
 
04:45:20.868 --> 04:45:20.878 align:start position:0%
and there are 27
 
04:45:24.530 --> 04:45:24.540 align:start position:0%
I think I've got this right 27 uh
 
04:45:26.330 --> 04:45:26.340 align:start position:0%
Charters uh
 
04:45:28.550 --> 04:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
schools who operate these are public
 
04:45:30.890 --> 04:45:30.900 align:start position:0%
schools who provide dinner but not
 
04:45:33.288 --> 04:45:33.298 align:start position:0%
breakfast so we're talking about this
 
04:45:36.050 --> 04:45:36.060 align:start position:0%
bill at this point as amended affecting
 
04:45:38.090 --> 04:45:38.100 align:start position:0%
the 27 schools that you'll provide
 
04:45:40.010 --> 04:45:40.020 align:start position:0%
breakfast in the six schools that
 
04:45:43.788 --> 04:45:43.798 align:start position:0%
provide neither dinner nor or lunch or
 
04:45:47.448 --> 04:45:47.458 align:start position:0%
breakfast just as a trying to put this
 
04:45:49.788 --> 04:45:49.798 align:start position:0%
in this context I'd be happy to try to
 
04:45:51.170 --> 04:45:51.180 align:start position:0%
answer any questions there are other
 
04:45:53.330 --> 04:45:53.340 align:start position:0%
people that will follow me up here we'll
 
04:45:55.368 --> 04:45:55.378 align:start position:0%

we've saved all that ammunition for you
 
04:46:49.850 --> 04:46:49.860 align:start position:0%
thank you very much chairman Ladd I
 
04:46:51.948 --> 04:46:51.958 align:start position:0%
noticed that uh representative Ellison
 
04:46:55.070 --> 04:46:55.080 align:start position:0%
received one question on introducing the
 
04:46:59.230 --> 04:46:59.240 align:start position:0%
bill so uh
 
04:47:02.810 --> 04:47:02.820 align:start position:0%
and I immediately uh turned around and
 
04:47:05.570 --> 04:47:05.580 align:start position:0%
said who it who defers to Kelly Rambo
 
04:47:07.490 --> 04:47:07.500 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Education on
 
04:47:10.070 --> 04:47:10.080 align:start position:0%
every fact and figure thank you uh
 
04:47:11.810 --> 04:47:11.820 align:start position:0%
chairman Ladd and members of the
 
04:47:13.930 --> 04:47:13.940 align:start position:0%
committee for hearing me today
 
04:47:16.190 --> 04:47:16.200 align:start position:0%
uh during the last session this
 
04:47:17.690 --> 04:47:17.700 align:start position:0%
committee heard a number of bills
 
04:47:19.550 --> 04:47:19.560 align:start position:0%
regarding student hunger
 
04:47:21.890 --> 04:47:21.900 align:start position:0%
the acknowledgment of the problem and
 
04:47:25.250 --> 04:47:25.260 align:start position:0%
interest in seeking Solutions led to the
 
04:47:27.470 --> 04:47:27.480 align:start position:0%
establishment of the study committee on
 
04:47:31.070 --> 04:47:31.080 align:start position:0%
house bill 1229 which uh representative
 
04:47:34.550 --> 04:47:34.560 align:start position:0%
and chair Ladd appointed me chair of
 
04:47:37.250 --> 04:47:37.260 align:start position:0%
Representatives Allison Hall Woodcock
 
04:47:40.190 --> 04:47:40.200 align:start position:0%
lekinson Ford all served on that study
 
04:47:42.170 --> 04:47:42.180 align:start position:0%
committee which met consistently last
 
04:47:43.990 --> 04:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
summer and fall
 
04:47:47.208 --> 04:47:47.218 align:start position:0%
Jennifer four as mentioned your talented
 
04:47:49.190 --> 04:47:49.200 align:start position:0%
research assistant was able to pull
 
04:47:51.830 --> 04:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
together information from five states
 
04:47:54.110 --> 04:47:54.120 align:start position:0%
with similar demographics to see what
 
04:47:56.990 --> 04:47:57.000 align:start position:0%
initiatives they had in place to address
 
04:47:59.448 --> 04:47:59.458 align:start position:0%
the needs of their hungry kids
 
04:48:02.690 --> 04:48:02.700 align:start position:0%
those states are Delaware Maine New
 
04:48:06.288 --> 04:48:06.298 align:start position:0%
Mexico Vermont and West Virginia
 
04:48:07.910 --> 04:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
I believe that most committee members
 
04:48:09.708 --> 04:48:09.718 align:start position:0%
would tell you that they learned quite a
 
04:48:11.990 --> 04:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
lot by going through the process of
 
04:48:13.850 --> 04:48:13.860 align:start position:0%
studying that bill
 
04:48:16.550 --> 04:48:16.560 align:start position:0%
Maine requires all schools to
 
04:48:18.470 --> 04:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
participate in the national school lunch
 
04:48:21.410 --> 04:48:21.420 align:start position:0%
program Vermont requires participation
 
04:48:24.948 --> 04:48:24.958 align:start position:0%
in both breakfast and lunch West
 
04:48:27.288 --> 04:48:27.298 align:start position:0%
Virginia requires all schools to operate
 
04:48:30.170 --> 04:48:30.180 align:start position:0%
a school nutrition program that provides
 
04:48:32.570 --> 04:48:32.580 align:start position:0%
both breakfast and lunch though the
 
04:48:34.610 --> 04:48:34.620 align:start position:0%
national school lunch program is not
 
04:48:34.620 --> 04:48:36.350 align:start position:0%
national school lunch program is not
specified

04:48:36.350 --> 04:48:36.360 align:start position:0%

information provided by our own New
 
04:48:41.150 --> 04:48:41.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hunger Solutions ranks New
 
04:48:45.530 --> 04:48:45.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as 47th out of 50 states in
 
04:48:48.288 --> 04:48:48.298 align:start position:0%
school breakfast participation even
 
04:48:50.208 --> 04:48:50.218 align:start position:0%
though we know that students who are fed
 
04:48:52.550 --> 04:48:52.560 align:start position:0%
demonstrate improved academic
 
04:48:52.560 --> 04:48:54.170 align:start position:0%

04:48:57.590 --> 04:48:57.600 align:start position:0%
reduce behavioral problems improved
 
04:49:01.128 --> 04:49:01.138 align:start position:0%
attendance higher graduation rates and
 
04:49:03.350 --> 04:49:03.360 align:start position:0%
fewer trips to the nurse
 
04:49:06.410 --> 04:49:06.420 align:start position:0%
in 2021 nearly half of the students who
 
04:49:08.930 --> 04:49:08.940 align:start position:0%
qualified for free or reduced meals went
 
04:49:11.330 --> 04:49:11.340 align:start position:0%
without even an opportunity for
 
04:49:13.128 --> 04:49:13.138 align:start position:0%
breakfast in New Hampshire
 
04:49:15.410 --> 04:49:15.420 align:start position:0%
and the state missed an opportunity to
 
04:49:18.830 --> 04:49:18.840 align:start position:0%
feed 7 800 additional students by
 
04:49:21.770 --> 04:49:21.780 align:start position:0%
leaving 1.5 million federal dollars on
 
04:49:23.330 --> 04:49:23.340 align:start position:0%
the table
 
04:49:25.788 --> 04:49:25.798 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hunger Solutions has a
 
04:49:28.310 --> 04:49:28.320 align:start position:0%
wealth of information and ideas about
 
04:49:30.890 --> 04:49:30.900 align:start position:0%
how to address food insecurity and I
 
04:49:33.110 --> 04:49:33.120 align:start position:0%
strongly encourage this committee to
 
04:49:36.110 --> 04:49:36.120 align:start position:0%
reach out to them for help in any
 
04:49:38.750 --> 04:49:38.760 align:start position:0%
measures that you craft from this point
 
04:49:40.670 --> 04:49:40.680 align:start position:0%
forward I know that they're with us
 
04:49:42.350 --> 04:49:42.360 align:start position:0%
today and will be following me I'm sure
 
04:49:44.270 --> 04:49:44.280 align:start position:0%
at this microphone
 
04:49:46.610 --> 04:49:46.620 align:start position:0%
student hunger is real
 
04:49:48.770 --> 04:49:48.780 align:start position:0%
I know many of you will voice a concern
 
04:49:50.448 --> 04:49:50.458 align:start position:0%
about the cost of requiring
 
04:49:52.910 --> 04:49:52.920 align:start position:0%
participation in a meals program and I
 
04:49:55.250 --> 04:49:55.260 align:start position:0%
share those concerns
 
04:49:57.470 --> 04:49:57.480 align:start position:0%
but the reality is the communities are
 
04:49:59.448 --> 04:49:59.458 align:start position:0%
going to pay for Hungry kids one way or
 
04:50:01.490 --> 04:50:01.500 align:start position:0%
another be it increased special ed
 
04:50:05.030 --> 04:50:05.040 align:start position:0%

04:50:08.930 --> 04:50:08.940 align:start position:0%
I have heard New Hampshire described as
 
04:50:10.970 --> 04:50:10.980 align:start position:0%
the best place to live but I would
 
04:50:13.070 --> 04:50:13.080 align:start position:0%
challenge that that is not the
 
04:50:15.830 --> 04:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
perception for families who struggle to
 
04:50:18.470 --> 04:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
put food on the table and a roof over
 
04:50:19.970 --> 04:50:19.980 align:start position:0%
their heads
 
04:50:22.610 --> 04:50:22.620 align:start position:0%
communities require a partnership with
 
04:50:24.890 --> 04:50:24.900 align:start position:0%
the state to address the needs of their
 
04:50:27.830 --> 04:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
most vulnerable populations yet past
 
04:50:30.230 --> 04:50:30.240 align:start position:0%
efforts to expand the state's role have
 
04:50:33.170 --> 04:50:33.180 align:start position:0%
been met with resistance or inaction at
 
04:50:33.180 --> 04:50:34.128 align:start position:0%
been met with resistance or inaction at
best

04:50:34.128 --> 04:50:34.138 align:start position:0%
best
 
04:50:36.470 --> 04:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
there may be cries about whether or not
 
04:50:39.708 --> 04:50:39.718 align:start position:0%
this represents an unfunded mandate
 
04:50:41.930 --> 04:50:41.940 align:start position:0%
but those questions can be addressed
 
04:50:45.050 --> 04:50:45.060 align:start position:0%
quite simply it's not an unfunded
 
04:50:47.890 --> 04:50:47.900 align:start position:0%
mandate if we fund it
 
04:50:50.030 --> 04:50:50.040 align:start position:0%
recently the front page of the union
 
04:50:52.550 --> 04:50:52.560 align:start position:0%
leader heralded New Hampshire's 300
 
04:50:55.190 --> 04:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
million dollar Surplus which today I
 
04:50:58.788 --> 04:50:58.798 align:start position:0%
learned is actually 283 million uh so I
 
04:51:01.550 --> 04:51:01.560 align:start position:0%
don't want to exaggerate the amount they
 
04:51:03.650 --> 04:51:03.660 align:start position:0%
indicated in the in the newspaper that
 
04:51:05.270 --> 04:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
there would be much discussion in
 
04:51:07.550 --> 04:51:07.560 align:start position:0%
Concord about how to utilize the excess
 
04:51:07.560 --> 04:51:08.690 align:start position:0%
Concord about how to utilize the excess
Revenue

04:51:08.690 --> 04:51:08.700 align:start position:0%
Revenue
 
04:51:11.628 --> 04:51:11.638 align:start position:0%
that in my opinion is an exercise in
 
04:51:14.150 --> 04:51:14.160 align:start position:0%
setting priorities and what should be a
 
04:51:15.830 --> 04:51:15.840 align:start position:0%
greater priority than caring for New
 
04:51:17.810 --> 04:51:17.820 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's children
 
04:51:19.730 --> 04:51:19.740 align:start position:0%
rather than filling our discussions
 
04:51:22.070 --> 04:51:22.080 align:start position:0%
about why we can't expand the
 
04:51:25.310 --> 04:51:25.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity for our hungry kids to eat I
 
04:51:27.410 --> 04:51:27.420 align:start position:0%
would suggest that it's time to start a
 
04:51:29.990 --> 04:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
serious conversation about what we can
 
04:51:33.230 --> 04:51:33.240 align:start position:0%
do to assure that no economically
 
04:51:36.470 --> 04:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
challenged child is distracted by an
 
04:51:38.030 --> 04:51:38.040 align:start position:0%
empty stomach
 
04:51:40.430 --> 04:51:40.440 align:start position:0%
we need to require school districts to
 
04:51:42.530 --> 04:51:42.540 align:start position:0%
feed those who can't feed themselves and
 
04:51:45.050 --> 04:51:45.060 align:start position:0%
offer those communities the help that it
 
04:51:47.390 --> 04:51:47.400 align:start position:0%
requires to make it happen
 
04:51:50.030 --> 04:51:50.040 align:start position:0%
I ask you to please support House Bill
 
04:51:53.448 --> 04:51:53.458 align:start position:0%
429 I thank you for your time today and
 
04:51:55.610 --> 04:51:55.620 align:start position:0%
it feels good to be home
 
04:51:57.948 --> 04:51:57.958 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much now we can
 
04:52:01.070 --> 04:52:01.080 align:start position:0%
ask those non-softball questions go for
 
04:52:01.080 --> 04:52:01.990 align:start position:0%
ask those non-softball questions go for
it

04:52:01.990 --> 04:52:02.000 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:52:05.150 --> 04:52:05.160 align:start position:0%
what can I do for you chairman Ladd a
 
04:52:05.160 --> 04:52:07.368 align:start position:0%
what can I do for you chairman Ladd a
representative

04:52:07.368 --> 04:52:07.378 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:52:09.708 --> 04:52:09.718 align:start position:0%
you knew you were going to give me I I
 
04:52:11.810 --> 04:52:11.820 align:start position:0%
would have I would have bet money on
 
04:52:11.820 --> 04:52:13.430 align:start position:0%
would have I would have bet money on
that

04:52:13.430 --> 04:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:52:16.368 --> 04:52:16.378 align:start position:0%
so I'm wondering down where it says um
 
04:52:19.070 --> 04:52:19.080 align:start position:0%
each School District shall participate
 
04:52:21.530 --> 04:52:21.540 align:start position:0%
instead of which participates in the
 
04:52:23.570 --> 04:52:23.580 align:start position:0%
National School breakfast program and
 
04:52:25.490 --> 04:52:25.500 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering about schools like
 
04:52:28.070 --> 04:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
Londonderry which have totally opted out
 
04:52:31.730 --> 04:52:31.740 align:start position:0%
of any of the federal programs having to
 
04:52:33.830 --> 04:52:33.840 align:start position:0%
do with meals and have decided to deal
 
04:52:36.050 --> 04:52:36.060 align:start position:0%
with it entirely within their school
 
04:52:39.050 --> 04:52:39.060 align:start position:0%
district do they need to take part in
 
04:52:42.470 --> 04:52:42.480 align:start position:0%
this National School thing if they are
 
04:52:45.590 --> 04:52:45.600 align:start position:0%
had figured out how to deal with it on a
 
04:52:47.510 --> 04:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
district level right as you all know
 
04:52:49.368 --> 04:52:49.378 align:start position:0%
representative fleckis because we talked
 
04:52:51.770 --> 04:52:51.780 align:start position:0%
about this uh at Great length for months
 
04:52:54.170 --> 04:52:54.180 align:start position:0%
uh I I don't really have an answer for
 
04:52:58.270 --> 04:52:58.280 align:start position:0%
that there are in fact uh opportunities
 
04:53:02.270 --> 04:53:02.280 align:start position:0%
for discussion and examination about
 
04:53:04.850 --> 04:53:04.860 align:start position:0%
what would be gained or lost by a school
 
04:53:08.990 --> 04:53:09.000 align:start position:0%
that privately provides the meals uh my
 
04:53:11.150 --> 04:53:11.160 align:start position:0%
greater greater concern is for schools
 
04:53:13.910 --> 04:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
that are not providing anything you know
 
04:53:15.170 --> 04:53:15.180 align:start position:0%
that they're not involved in the
 
04:53:17.090 --> 04:53:17.100 align:start position:0%
National program and they're not doing
 
04:53:19.070 --> 04:53:19.080 align:start position:0%
anything on their own but school
 
04:53:20.628 --> 04:53:20.638 align:start position:0%
districts like Londonderry and Hanover
 
04:53:21.830 --> 04:53:21.840 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to have that
 
04:53:25.250 --> 04:53:25.260 align:start position:0%
conversation because uh they uh they do
 
04:53:27.230 --> 04:53:27.240 align:start position:0%
in fact provide meals but they are not
 
04:53:30.708 --> 04:53:30.718 align:start position:0%
part of that National program
 
04:53:32.150 --> 04:53:32.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:53:34.850 --> 04:53:34.860 align:start position:0%
representative dry
 
04:53:37.368 --> 04:53:37.378 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you uh for
 
04:53:40.310 --> 04:53:40.320 align:start position:0%
taking this um can I look on the front
 
04:53:42.530 --> 04:53:42.540 align:start position:0%
page of your testimony at the very third
 
04:53:44.150 --> 04:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
line from the bottom and could you
 
04:53:46.490 --> 04:53:46.500 align:start position:0%
explain to me how New Hampshire missed
 
04:53:49.010 --> 04:53:49.020 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to feed 7 800 additional
 
04:53:50.810 --> 04:53:50.820 align:start position:0%
students by leaving 1.5 million federal
 
04:53:53.030 --> 04:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
dollars on the table oh generally it has
 
04:53:54.530 --> 04:53:54.540 align:start position:0%
to do with the direct Medicaid
 
04:53:57.050 --> 04:53:57.060 align:start position:0%
certification process we have the
 
04:53:59.990 --> 04:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity to apply to be a state that
 
04:54:02.990 --> 04:54:03.000 align:start position:0%
automatically certifies uh families
 
04:54:05.570 --> 04:54:05.580 align:start position:0%
whose children are eligible for Medicaid
 
04:54:08.628 --> 04:54:08.638 align:start position:0%
in the school lunch program and reduced
 
04:54:11.628 --> 04:54:11.638 align:start position:0%
and free lunches uh it was a request it
 
04:54:14.090 --> 04:54:14.100 align:start position:0%
was the requirement was that we fill in
 
04:54:16.490 --> 04:54:16.500 align:start position:0%
an application and be accepted by it we
 
04:54:19.910 --> 04:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
had a deadline and that application did
 
04:54:21.830 --> 04:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
not go in by the deadline so therefore
 
04:54:21.840 --> 04:54:23.150 align:start position:0%
not go in by the deadline so therefore
we

04:54:23.150 --> 04:54:23.160 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:54:25.250 --> 04:54:25.260 align:start position:0%
we're not eligible to receive any of the
 
04:54:27.230 --> 04:54:27.240 align:start position:0%
funds that went along with it okay okay
 
04:54:31.610 --> 04:54:31.620 align:start position:0%
can I follow up yes uh so who's the we
 
04:54:33.650 --> 04:54:33.660 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire it's like the
 
04:54:34.970 --> 04:54:34.980 align:start position:0%
Department of Education whose
 
04:54:36.288 --> 04:54:36.298 align:start position:0%
responsibility is it it was the
 
04:54:39.590 --> 04:54:39.600 align:start position:0%
department of education's uh purview to
 
04:54:41.570 --> 04:54:41.580 align:start position:0%
submit the application okay thank you
 
04:54:42.830 --> 04:54:42.840 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
04:54:46.010 --> 04:54:46.020 align:start position:0%
uh honorable Mullen um I was going to
 
04:54:48.230 --> 04:54:48.240 align:start position:0%
ask you the question about Hanover
 
04:54:48.240 --> 04:54:48.890 align:start position:0%
ask you the question about Hanover
um

04:54:48.890 --> 04:54:48.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:54:51.650 --> 04:54:51.660 align:start position:0%
see them up from that neck of the woods
 
04:54:51.660 --> 04:54:52.448 align:start position:0%
see them up from that neck of the woods
um

04:54:52.448 --> 04:54:52.458 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:54:56.448 --> 04:54:56.458 align:start position:0%
is would you be opposed to some kind of
 
04:55:00.050 --> 04:55:00.060 align:start position:0%
amending language to allow a a town like
 
04:55:02.510 --> 04:55:02.520 align:start position:0%
Hanover which is feeding their
 
04:55:02.520 --> 04:55:03.830 align:start position:0%
Hanover which is feeding their
youngsters

04:55:03.830 --> 04:55:03.840 align:start position:0%
youngsters
 
04:55:07.670 --> 04:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
and has the money to continue doing that
 
04:55:11.150 --> 04:55:11.160 align:start position:0%
um so that we allow that ability for the
 
04:55:15.470 --> 04:55:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:17.750 --> 04:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
form answer to the question but I will
 
04:55:19.490 --> 04:55:19.500 align:start position:0%
tell you what my thoughts are about it I
 
04:55:20.810 --> 04:55:20.820 align:start position:0%
would direct you to representative
 
04:55:22.610 --> 04:55:22.620 align:start position:0%
Ellison who's the Prime sponsor about
 
04:55:24.288 --> 04:55:24.298 align:start position:0%
whether or not he's comfortable with
 
04:55:27.948 --> 04:55:27.958 align:start position:0%
with that Amendment uh but what the
 
04:55:29.448 --> 04:55:29.458 align:start position:0%
questions that I would be asking in
 
04:55:31.910 --> 04:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
Hanover in Londonderry would have to do
 
04:55:34.788 --> 04:55:34.798 align:start position:0%
with how they accommodate kids who can't
 
04:55:37.490 --> 04:55:37.500 align:start position:0%
afford to pay for lunch I mean we know
 
04:55:39.770 --> 04:55:39.780 align:start position:0%
what the federal program does you have
 
04:55:41.750 --> 04:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
to fill an application and be found
 
04:55:44.510 --> 04:55:44.520 align:start position:0%
eligible and we know what the rates are
 
04:55:47.750 --> 04:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
in a privately operated feeding system
 
04:55:50.750 --> 04:55:50.760 align:start position:0%
what we would want to see obviously is
 
04:55:53.750 --> 04:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
that in those situations if there were
 
04:55:55.670 --> 04:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
families that couldn't afford the price
 
04:55:57.708 --> 04:55:57.718 align:start position:0%
of the meal that the kids were fed
 
04:55:57.718 --> 04:55:59.270 align:start position:0%
of the meal that the kids were fed
anyhow

04:55:59.270 --> 04:55:59.280 align:start position:0%
anyhow
 
04:56:03.110 --> 04:56:03.120 align:start position:0%
yeah we know that Hanover the
 
04:56:06.470 --> 04:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
afraid of trying to if Hanover being a
 
04:56:08.570 --> 04:56:08.580 align:start position:0%
community where the free and reduced
 
04:56:11.390 --> 04:56:11.400 align:start position:0%
population is less
 
04:56:15.650 --> 04:56:15.660 align:start position:0%
than most districts in this state so if
 
04:56:18.170 --> 04:56:18.180 align:start position:0%
they are able to assure that those
 
04:56:21.288 --> 04:56:21.298 align:start position:0%
youngsters are going to be fed
 
04:56:22.970 --> 04:56:22.980 align:start position:0%
would you have a problem with that
 
04:56:25.070 --> 04:56:25.080 align:start position:0%
personally no okay
 
04:56:27.830 --> 04:56:27.840 align:start position:0%
no I mean representative Noble is in a
 
04:56:29.810 --> 04:56:29.820 align:start position:0%
similar situation bedford's free and
 
04:56:32.510 --> 04:56:32.520 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch uh population is hovers
 
04:56:35.570 --> 04:56:35.580 align:start position:0%
usually around five percent so you know
 
04:56:37.250 --> 04:56:37.260 align:start position:0%
I don't think it would represent a heart
 
04:56:38.690 --> 04:56:38.700 align:start position:0%
Londonderry might be a little different
 
04:56:41.690 --> 04:56:41.700 align:start position:0%
because I my guess is that their freedom
 
04:56:43.550 --> 04:56:43.560 align:start position:0%
reduced population is larger than that
 
04:56:45.708 --> 04:56:45.718 align:start position:0%
but I don't know that it would represent
 
04:56:48.910 --> 04:56:48.920 align:start position:0%
a hardship to those districts to even
 
04:56:51.650 --> 04:56:51.660 align:start position:0%
have to provide free lunches for
 
04:56:53.990 --> 04:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
eligible kids I think Londonderry would
 
04:56:55.730 --> 04:56:55.740 align:start position:0%
have a problem with seeing that having a
 
04:56:57.110 --> 04:56:57.120 align:start position:0%
problem with special education costs
 
04:56:57.120 --> 04:56:58.970 align:start position:0%
problem with special education costs
yeah

04:56:58.970 --> 04:56:58.980 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:57:02.750 --> 04:57:02.760 align:start position:0%
all righty uh yes represent Balboni
 
04:57:04.610 --> 04:57:04.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
04:57:07.430 --> 04:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question representative Ramon
 
04:57:11.270 --> 04:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
uh my question is uh do we know why uh
 
04:57:13.730 --> 04:57:13.740 align:start position:0%
the the schools aren't participating the
 
04:57:16.788 --> 04:57:16.798 align:start position:0%
six that don't have either or uh the 27
 
04:57:19.250 --> 04:57:19.260 align:start position:0%
that don't provide the purpose I do not
 
04:57:23.770 --> 04:57:23.780 align:start position:0%
have the answer to that but uh your
 
04:57:26.868 --> 04:57:26.878 align:start position:0%
devoted and dedicated doe staff member
 
04:57:29.470 --> 04:57:29.480 align:start position:0%
Kelly Rambo is behind me as I mentioned

04:58:37.368 --> 04:58:37.378 align:start position:0%
information yesterday afternoon and she
 
04:58:38.930 --> 04:58:38.940 align:start position:0%
came through and she said she did and
 
04:58:41.330 --> 04:58:41.340 align:start position:0%
always has so I'm gonna provide a very
 
04:58:43.610 --> 04:58:43.620 align:start position:0%
uh simple approach uh to this bill
 
04:58:46.190 --> 04:58:46.200 align:start position:0%
particularly after listening to
 
04:58:47.510 --> 04:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
um representative Mullen and former
 
04:58:49.190 --> 04:58:49.200 align:start position:0%
president Mullen I threw my other sheet
 
04:58:51.770 --> 04:58:51.780 align:start position:0%
away because it's just me duplicate but
 
04:58:54.230 --> 04:58:54.240 align:start position:0%
it's really a simple bill
 
04:58:56.030 --> 04:58:56.040 align:start position:0%
um it has Suits that as a result of the
 
04:58:58.670 --> 04:58:58.680 align:start position:0%
committee from the summer led by her
 
04:59:01.850 --> 04:59:01.860 align:start position:0%
obviously and Alicia is in yours is
 
04:59:01.860 --> 04:59:03.590 align:start position:0%
obviously and Alicia is in yours is
there

04:59:03.590 --> 04:59:03.600 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:59:05.690 --> 04:59:05.700 align:start position:0%
this like many of the bills are going to
 
04:59:08.090 --> 04:59:08.100 align:start position:0%
follow over the next two years help
 
04:59:10.550 --> 04:59:10.560 align:start position:0%
support both the structure for the
 
04:59:12.948 --> 04:59:12.958 align:start position:0%
participation in public schools meals
 
04:59:12.958 --> 04:59:13.910 align:start position:0%
participation in public schools meals
program

04:59:13.910 --> 04:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:59:16.610 --> 04:59:16.620 align:start position:0%
the initial 429 Bill included Charter
 
04:59:18.890 --> 04:59:18.900 align:start position:0%
Schools was mentioned but after much
 
04:59:20.628 --> 04:59:20.638 align:start position:0%
discussion and phone calls written
 
04:59:22.610 --> 04:59:22.620 align:start position:0%
testimony in addition to the information
 
04:59:25.070 --> 04:59:25.080 align:start position:0%
that was presented just yesterday is
 
04:59:26.868 --> 04:59:26.878 align:start position:0%
clear that only 15 percent of the
 
04:59:29.390 --> 04:59:29.400 align:start position:0%
charter schools which equals only six by
 
04:59:31.250 --> 04:59:31.260 align:start position:0%
the way at this point a currently
 
04:59:34.610 --> 04:59:34.620 align:start position:0%
providing meals out of the 43 but it's
 
04:59:36.288 --> 04:59:36.298 align:start position:0%
also clear that many other charter
 
04:59:38.690 --> 04:59:38.700 align:start position:0%
schools are using vendor programs and
 
04:59:40.910 --> 04:59:40.920 align:start position:0%
are servicing the youngsters so we're
 
04:59:42.830 --> 04:59:42.840 align:start position:0%
taking that right out of the issue so we
 
04:59:46.128 --> 04:59:46.138 align:start position:0%
get down to the the real task in hand
 
04:59:48.890 --> 04:59:48.900 align:start position:0%
this bill this bill deals specifically
 
04:59:51.590 --> 04:59:51.600 align:start position:0%
with the structure of providing two
 
04:59:53.448 --> 04:59:53.458 align:start position:0%
meals a day for students in each of our
 
04:59:55.850 --> 04:59:55.860 align:start position:0%
schools that's it it's not a heavy lift
 
04:59:57.890 --> 04:59:57.900 align:start position:0%
those two schools already have the
 
04:59:57.900 --> 04:59:59.030 align:start position:0%
those two schools already have the
facilities

04:59:59.030 --> 04:59:59.040 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
05:00:00.410 --> 05:00:00.420 align:start position:0%
I'm going to ask you I was going to have
 
05:00:02.208 --> 05:00:02.218 align:start position:0%
an activity for you but I won't because
 
05:00:03.830 --> 05:00:03.840 align:start position:0%
I I can see representative Cordell
 
05:00:06.288 --> 05:00:06.298 align:start position:0%
you're getting over there bye I'm going
 
05:00:08.990 --> 05:00:09.000 align:start position:0%
to ask you to just take a minute and
 
05:00:11.628 --> 05:00:11.638 align:start position:0%
think about this little issue this this
 
05:00:13.430 --> 05:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
I'm going to frame a different way
 
05:00:16.490 --> 05:00:16.500 align:start position:0%
imagine if you will you are hosting
 
05:00:18.230 --> 05:00:18.240 align:start position:0%
several people in your home this weekend
 
05:00:20.930 --> 05:00:20.940 align:start position:0%
and they're arriving Friday night
 
05:00:22.670 --> 05:00:22.680 align:start position:0%
and you're all hitting out early
 
05:00:24.830 --> 05:00:24.840 align:start position:0%
Saturday morning for some fun time in
 
05:00:26.810 --> 05:00:26.820 align:start position:0%
the beautiful White Mountains but you
 
05:00:28.310 --> 05:00:28.320 align:start position:0%
have to provide a breakfast for this
 
05:00:30.230 --> 05:00:30.240 align:start position:0%
group before I head out
 
05:00:32.390 --> 05:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
and your task was going to be right down
 
05:00:34.368 --> 05:00:34.378 align:start position:0%
but I won't I'm going to ask you to take
 
05:00:37.430 --> 05:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
30 seconds and think about what you
 
05:00:40.250 --> 05:00:40.260 align:start position:0%
might do Friday night before the
 
05:00:42.590 --> 05:00:42.600 align:start position:0%
Saturday morning when this Live Crew in
 
05:00:45.410 --> 05:00:45.420 align:start position:0%
your house goes down to breakfast just
 
05:00:47.030 --> 05:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
think about what you might do in
 
05:00:48.650 --> 05:00:48.660 align:start position:0%
preparation for that live group it'll
 
05:00:50.628 --> 05:00:50.638 align:start position:0%
take a few seconds 10 seconds a few
 
05:00:58.550 --> 05:00:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:01.128 --> 05:01:01.138 align:start position:0%
okay now I want to ask anybody to speak
 
05:01:03.948 --> 05:01:03.958 align:start position:0%
on that representative kennel uh but the
 
05:01:06.170 --> 05:01:06.180 align:start position:0%
point of this activity which reminds you
 
05:01:07.788 --> 05:01:07.798 align:start position:0%
there are many things that can be done
 
05:01:11.330 --> 05:01:11.340 align:start position:0%
in advance of providing a nutritious
 
05:01:13.550 --> 05:01:13.560 align:start position:0%
breakfast without a great amount of
 
05:01:16.610 --> 05:01:16.620 align:start position:0%
extra work uh for example you may have
 
05:01:17.990 --> 05:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
set the table you might have put out
 
05:01:20.150 --> 05:01:20.160 align:start position:0%
paper phonics cups smoothies napkins
 
05:01:22.430 --> 05:01:22.440 align:start position:0%
paper bowls five blocks of the cereal
 
05:01:24.530 --> 05:01:24.540 align:start position:0%
where you get my point so Saturday
 
05:01:26.390 --> 05:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
morning you just get up perk the coffee
 
05:01:28.550 --> 05:01:28.560 align:start position:0%
set out the milk and Juice no heavy
 
05:01:29.690 --> 05:01:29.700 align:start position:0%
lifting and you're on your way and
 
05:01:32.510 --> 05:01:32.520 align:start position:0%
everybody has breakfast that is exactly
 
05:01:34.550 --> 05:01:34.560 align:start position:0%
the point of this bill
 
05:01:37.128 --> 05:01:37.138 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't require bacon eggs
 
05:01:39.288 --> 05:01:39.298 align:start position:0%
pancakes lots of cooking it doesn't
 
05:01:42.230 --> 05:01:42.240 align:start position:0%
require multiple staff it's as simple as
 
05:01:44.448 --> 05:01:44.458 align:start position:0%
setting up a quick grab and go
 
05:01:46.190 --> 05:01:46.200 align:start position:0%
and I mentioned this because there were
 
05:01:49.868 --> 05:01:49.878 align:start position:0%
only a small number of schools 27.
 
05:01:52.970 --> 05:01:52.980 align:start position:0%
27 schools in our state that are not
 
05:01:55.070 --> 05:01:55.080 align:start position:0%
doing this they're already providing
 
05:01:56.868 --> 05:01:56.878 align:start position:0%
lunch folks they have the facilities
 
05:01:58.190 --> 05:01:58.200 align:start position:0%
they have the kitchen they have the
 
05:02:00.410 --> 05:02:00.420 align:start position:0%
staff we're not talking about much here
 
05:02:03.470 --> 05:02:03.480 align:start position:0%
but the important part of this bill is
 
05:02:05.448 --> 05:02:05.458 align:start position:0%
the option for students to begin their
 
05:02:08.208 --> 05:02:08.218 align:start position:0%
day with nutritious flight meals please
 
05:02:11.030 --> 05:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
understand these students have already
 
05:02:14.150 --> 05:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
been identified as needing a breakfast
 
05:02:16.970 --> 05:02:16.980 align:start position:0%
and a lunch they have been eligible for
 
05:02:18.770 --> 05:02:18.780 align:start position:0%
are free or reduced breakfast and lunch
 
05:02:20.628 --> 05:02:20.638 align:start position:0%
because they are in poverty aren't
 
05:02:22.368 --> 05:02:22.378 align:start position:0%
getting the food they need this
 
05:02:25.368 --> 05:02:25.378 align:start position:0%
assumption but we're not providing it we
 
05:02:27.470 --> 05:02:27.480 align:start position:0%
all know it's better to feed the brain
 
05:02:29.448 --> 05:02:29.458 align:start position:0%
so all I'm telling you in a very simple
 
05:02:32.030 --> 05:02:32.040 align:start position:0%
way and not as eloquently as uh
 
05:02:33.650 --> 05:02:33.660 align:start position:0%
honorable Mullins over there or Allison
 
05:02:35.510 --> 05:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
just to get down their brass simple
 
05:02:37.970 --> 05:02:37.980 align:start position:0%
facts this bill requires that all
 
05:02:40.190 --> 05:02:40.200 align:start position:0%
schools that are receiving federal funds
 
05:02:42.708 --> 05:02:42.718 align:start position:0%
to fulfill the obligation of providing
 
05:02:44.810 --> 05:02:44.820 align:start position:0%
the two meals a day as they share to
 
05:02:46.610 --> 05:02:46.620 align:start position:0%
those two youngsters that qualify it's
 
05:02:48.288 --> 05:02:48.298 align:start position:0%
as simple as that
 
05:02:50.590 --> 05:02:50.600 align:start position:0%
so that is that is what I have I'd be
 
05:02:54.230 --> 05:02:54.240 align:start position:0%
more than happy to answer thank you are
 
05:02:55.368 --> 05:02:55.378 align:start position:0%
there any questions representative
 
05:02:55.378 --> 05:02:57.110 align:start position:0%
there any questions representative
leckis

05:02:57.110 --> 05:02:57.120 align:start position:0%
leckis
 
05:02:59.810 --> 05:02:59.820 align:start position:0%
yeah you seem to be talking thank you
 
05:03:02.090 --> 05:03:02.100 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
05:03:04.430 --> 05:03:04.440 align:start position:0%
you you were seem to be talking about
 
05:03:07.250 --> 05:03:07.260 align:start position:0%
providing these meals just for the free
 
05:03:10.430 --> 05:03:10.440 align:start position:0%
and reduced lunch kids but the bill says
 
05:03:14.090 --> 05:03:14.100 align:start position:0%
any well the uh every pupil under its
 
05:03:17.448 --> 05:03:17.458 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction so are you then running a
 
05:03:20.390 --> 05:03:20.400 align:start position:0%
not just grab and go but pay and all of
 
05:03:22.730 --> 05:03:22.740 align:start position:0%
that for all students do all students
 
05:03:25.190 --> 05:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
have to participate can any particip how
 
05:03:27.470 --> 05:03:27.480 align:start position:0%
does it how does it the exactly thank
 
05:03:29.570 --> 05:03:29.580 align:start position:0%
you for the question represent Lucas I'm
 
05:03:30.590 --> 05:03:30.600 align:start position:0%
glad there's only one question alone
 
05:03:31.610 --> 05:03:31.620 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:03:33.530 --> 05:03:33.540 align:start position:0%
um it's actually just that simple that
 
05:03:34.910 --> 05:03:34.920 align:start position:0%
it would be at breakfast it doesn't have
 
05:03:36.410 --> 05:03:36.420 align:start position:0%
to be a big meal at a lunch meal but
 
05:03:37.550 --> 05:03:37.560 align:start position:0%
everyone that walks through the door
 
05:03:38.930 --> 05:03:38.940 align:start position:0%
wants to pay like they have their card
 
05:03:41.570 --> 05:03:41.580 align:start position:0%
in the pr system they would do that but
 
05:03:44.570 --> 05:03:44.580 align:start position:0%
the intent of the bill the reason for
 
05:03:47.448 --> 05:03:47.458 align:start position:0%
the bill is to provide in those 27
 
05:03:49.310 --> 05:03:49.320 align:start position:0%
schools where those youngsters did not
 
05:03:50.990 --> 05:03:51.000 align:start position:0%
have a breakfast or reasonable nutrition
 
05:03:52.970 --> 05:03:52.980 align:start position:0%
to come to school have the option to get
 
05:03:54.650 --> 05:03:54.660 align:start position:0%
anyone we're assuming it's probably
 
05:03:56.810 --> 05:03:56.820 align:start position:0%
incorrect that the other youngsters in
 
05:03:58.128 --> 05:03:58.138 align:start position:0%
the school have already had breakfast
 
05:03:59.448 --> 05:03:59.458 align:start position:0%
but that's probably not the case but
 
05:04:01.070 --> 05:04:01.080 align:start position:0%
beyond that this they would allow me to
 
05:04:02.750 --> 05:04:02.760 align:start position:0%
do this I guess my point at least they
 
05:04:04.190 --> 05:04:04.200 align:start position:0%
don't have to create a whole lot of
 
05:04:05.810 --> 05:04:05.820 align:start position:0%
stuff here it is take at least you have
 
05:04:07.490 --> 05:04:07.500 align:start position:0%
something that gets just started and I
 
05:04:08.628 --> 05:04:08.638 align:start position:0%
think we have that responsibility
 
05:04:10.250 --> 05:04:10.260 align:start position:0%
because we've already identified them
 
05:04:11.868 --> 05:04:11.878 align:start position:0%
saying you need that and we have the
 
05:04:13.368 --> 05:04:13.378 align:start position:0%
opportunity to provide that but thank
 
05:04:14.810 --> 05:04:14.820 align:start position:0%
you I didn't want to make it more
 
05:04:16.550 --> 05:04:16.560 align:start position:0%
confusing than it was
 
05:04:18.590 --> 05:04:18.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there further
 
05:04:22.430 --> 05:04:22.440 align:start position:0%
questions of Representative woodcock
 
05:04:24.050 --> 05:04:24.060 align:start position:0%
I'd have no that's a pleasure thank you
 
05:04:25.910 --> 05:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
I'd have snacks or Dunkin Donuts cards
 
05:04:27.708 --> 05:04:27.718 align:start position:0%
at the house and hand them out
 
05:04:29.410 --> 05:04:29.420 align:start position:0%
I'll be right there
 
05:04:32.990 --> 05:04:33.000 align:start position:0%
I know you would be okay next one up to
 
05:04:35.030 --> 05:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
on Deck here Tim uh representative Tim
 
05:04:35.040 --> 05:04:40.070 align:start position:0%
on Deck here Tim uh representative Tim
Oregon

05:04:40.070 --> 05:04:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:40.080 --> 05:04:44.288 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

05:04:44.288 --> 05:04:44.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:47.090 --> 05:04:47.100 align:start position:0%
Stratford County District 10 which is
 
05:04:49.730 --> 05:04:49.740 align:start position:0%
the town of Durham um and I won't even
 
05:04:51.470 --> 05:04:51.480 align:start position:0%
be able to speak as eloquently as a
 
05:04:53.208 --> 05:04:53.218 align:start position:0%
resident Woodcock she'll try to be quick
 
05:04:55.610 --> 05:04:55.620 align:start position:0%
because it's kind of a it peaked it
 
05:04:57.288 --> 05:04:57.298 align:start position:0%
peaked early he's going downhill from
 
05:05:00.708 --> 05:05:00.718 align:start position:0%
here but I'm a co-sponsor to build and I
 
05:05:03.230 --> 05:05:03.240 align:start position:0%
I want to make I think all all children
 
05:05:05.810 --> 05:05:05.820 align:start position:0%
in all public schools should have a
 
05:05:08.510 --> 05:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
access to breakfast a lot so no kid
 
05:05:10.550 --> 05:05:10.560 align:start position:0%
should go hungry and no kid can learn if
 
05:05:13.788 --> 05:05:13.798 align:start position:0%
they're if they're not hungry they're um
 
05:05:16.670 --> 05:05:16.680 align:start position:0%
either the fiscal note I'm I'm kind of
 
05:05:19.310 --> 05:05:19.320 align:start position:0%
baffled by that number 153 it seems like
 
05:05:21.410 --> 05:05:21.420 align:start position:0%
uh they're not operating Public Schools
 
05:05:23.390 --> 05:05:23.400 align:start position:0%
aren't doing School breakfast or lunch
 
05:05:27.050 --> 05:05:27.060 align:start position:0%
I'm surprised it's so many I do know
 
05:05:28.788 --> 05:05:28.798 align:start position:0%
um if we may need to tweet these
 
05:05:30.890 --> 05:05:30.900 align:start position:0%
legislation to cover school districts
 
05:05:32.150 --> 05:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
that aren't participating in the federal
 
05:05:35.090 --> 05:05:35.100 align:start position:0%
program but our uh providing the
 
05:05:36.650 --> 05:05:36.660 align:start position:0%
equivalent service of the kids that
 
05:05:38.448 --> 05:05:38.458 align:start position:0%
would be appropriate
 
05:05:40.670 --> 05:05:40.680 align:start position:0%
My Town also has a low percentage of
 
05:05:44.030 --> 05:05:44.040 align:start position:0%
free and reduced uh students but it is a
 
05:05:45.288 --> 05:05:45.298 align:start position:0%
significant percentage and we
 
05:05:47.150 --> 05:05:47.160 align:start position:0%
participate in the federal program and
 
05:05:48.948 --> 05:05:48.958 align:start position:0%
actually lived in Hanover for several
 
05:05:51.050 --> 05:05:51.060 align:start position:0%
years I surprised to learn that it's
 
05:05:54.530 --> 05:05:54.540 align:start position:0%
that it opted out but I'm um there may
 
05:05:55.850 --> 05:05:55.860 align:start position:0%
actually have something to do the fact
 
05:05:57.050 --> 05:05:57.060 align:start position:0%
that they're part of the interstate
 
05:05:59.030 --> 05:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
School District too so like half of the
 
05:06:01.250 --> 05:06:01.260 align:start position:0%
school district is in Vermont but um and
 
05:06:03.288 --> 05:06:03.298 align:start position:0%
they have many many tuition students at
 
05:06:05.570 --> 05:06:05.580 align:start position:0%
the high school but um
 
05:06:08.510 --> 05:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
so that's uh so I'm certainly uh I'm
 
05:06:10.190 --> 05:06:10.200 align:start position:0%
certainly amenable to doing any making
 
05:06:12.350 --> 05:06:12.360 align:start position:0%
an amendments we have to do to get the
 
05:06:14.570 --> 05:06:14.580 align:start position:0%
bill through the committee and through
 
05:06:16.128 --> 05:06:16.138 align:start position:0%
all the other steps it has to be to
 
05:06:17.570 --> 05:06:17.580 align:start position:0%
become law the main thing is to feed
 
05:06:19.190 --> 05:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
more children um
 
05:06:21.948 --> 05:06:21.958 align:start position:0%
I would have preferred leaving the
 
05:06:23.390 --> 05:06:23.400 align:start position:0%
charter schools in because our public
 
05:06:24.530 --> 05:06:24.540 align:start position:0%
schools that have all the same
 
05:06:26.690 --> 05:06:26.700 align:start position:0%
responsibilities as conventional public
 
05:06:28.670 --> 05:06:28.680 align:start position:0%
schools and uh
 
05:06:30.470 --> 05:06:30.480 align:start position:0%
sometimes we let them off the hooks on
 
05:06:32.150 --> 05:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
things and that artificially that
 
05:06:33.288 --> 05:06:33.298 align:start position:0%
creates the impression that they're
 
05:06:34.788 --> 05:06:34.798 align:start position:0%
doing it cheaper than they can in some
 
05:06:36.230 --> 05:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
videos because we're just not asking to
 
05:06:37.788 --> 05:06:37.798 align:start position:0%
do things that the regular schools have
 
05:06:40.310 --> 05:06:40.320 align:start position:0%
to do and that may include lunch and I
 
05:06:41.570 --> 05:06:41.580 align:start position:0%
think some of them
 
05:06:43.190 --> 05:06:43.200 align:start position:0%
and some of them must be provided I
 
05:06:44.510 --> 05:06:44.520 align:start position:0%
think as someone that I think are
 
05:06:46.788 --> 05:06:46.798 align:start position:0%
providing uh school lunches and or
 
05:06:48.410 --> 05:06:48.420 align:start position:0%
breakfasts already and they certainly
 
05:06:50.208 --> 05:06:50.218 align:start position:0%
all should at some point whether we can
 
05:06:53.530 --> 05:06:53.540 align:start position:0%
get there this year or not um apparently
 
05:06:56.030 --> 05:06:56.040 align:start position:0%
parents get a chance we can't and so an
 
05:06:57.890 --> 05:06:57.900 align:start position:0%
amendment to that amendment to make the
 
05:06:58.910 --> 05:06:58.920 align:start position:0%
bill work
 
05:07:00.708 --> 05:07:00.718 align:start position:0%
and get something passed this year would
 
05:07:03.350 --> 05:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
be fine by me so um and I
 
05:07:05.208 --> 05:07:05.218 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah sort of the chart just goes a
 
05:07:06.288 --> 05:07:06.298 align:start position:0%
lot of them don't have you know the
 
05:07:08.390 --> 05:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
cafeteria facilities in the building
 
05:07:10.670 --> 05:07:10.680 align:start position:0%
like all regular schools would have so
 
05:07:11.930 --> 05:07:11.940 align:start position:0%
that's um
 
05:07:13.970 --> 05:07:13.980 align:start position:0%
so I'm basically and I underline
 
05:07:15.170 --> 05:07:15.180 align:start position:0%
everything that uh the other
 
05:07:17.628 --> 05:07:17.638 align:start position:0%
representative said so I uh you know you
 
05:07:18.890 --> 05:07:18.900 align:start position:0%
have to work on the bill a little bit
 
05:07:20.570 --> 05:07:20.580 align:start position:0%
but I urge you to pass it and also
 
05:07:22.128 --> 05:07:22.138 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of concerns
 
05:07:25.010 --> 05:07:25.020 align:start position:0%
about the uh about the cost
 
05:07:26.628 --> 05:07:26.638 align:start position:0%
and some of you even try to claim it's
 
05:07:28.670 --> 05:07:28.680 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional I think that's uh false
 
05:07:30.590 --> 05:07:30.600 align:start position:0%
in any case
 
05:07:32.390 --> 05:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
both in this committee and then I guess
 
05:07:34.310 --> 05:07:34.320 align:start position:0%
it'll have to go to finance because it
 
05:07:36.708 --> 05:07:36.718 align:start position:0%
says early Bill we're here
 
05:07:36.718 --> 05:07:38.270 align:start position:0%
says early Bill we're here
certainly

05:07:38.270 --> 05:07:38.280 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
05:07:40.128 --> 05:07:40.138 align:start position:0%
you know certainly if we pay for it then
 
05:07:42.470 --> 05:07:42.480 align:start position:0%
there's no supposedly whatever article
 
05:07:45.708 --> 05:07:45.718 align:start position:0%
12a issue there and um once you have the
 
05:07:47.390 --> 05:07:47.400 align:start position:0%
school breakfast program it's all it's
 
05:07:49.868 --> 05:07:49.878 align:start position:0%
largely it's mostly
 
05:07:51.890 --> 05:07:51.900 align:start position:0%
self-subsidizing anyway because there's
 
05:07:54.470 --> 05:07:54.480 align:start position:0%
a lot of federal money in there you also
 
05:07:57.410 --> 05:07:57.420 align:start position:0%
have the families uh copay and then also
 
05:07:59.090 --> 05:07:59.100 align:start position:0%
they sell meals to the adults who are
 
05:08:01.430 --> 05:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
working in the school too at a at full
 
05:08:03.890 --> 05:08:03.900 align:start position:0%
price so actually and it's not
 
05:08:06.230 --> 05:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
particularly expensive to feed
 
05:08:08.030 --> 05:08:08.040 align:start position:0%
defeat children anyway at least
 
05:08:09.590 --> 05:08:09.600 align:start position:0%
certainly not expensive compared to the
 
05:08:11.330 --> 05:08:11.340 align:start position:0%
value of the service so like it's uh
 
05:08:14.030 --> 05:08:14.040 align:start position:0%
this is not really a big this is not
 
05:08:16.070 --> 05:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
that big taking an item and uh you know
 
05:08:18.770 --> 05:08:18.780 align:start position:0%
it pays you know pretty much uh paid
 
05:08:21.350 --> 05:08:21.360 align:start position:0%
more than pays for itself so I would say
 
05:08:21.360 --> 05:08:22.128 align:start position:0%
more than pays for itself so I would say
um

05:08:22.128 --> 05:08:22.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:08:24.890 --> 05:08:24.900 align:start position:0%
so I would say you know you make you
 
05:08:26.448 --> 05:08:26.458 align:start position:0%
know it may need an amendment to tweak
 
05:08:28.010 --> 05:08:28.020 align:start position:0%
some things I think the basic framework
 
05:08:30.230 --> 05:08:30.240 align:start position:0%
of this bill is strong and I hope it uh
 
05:08:33.050 --> 05:08:33.060 align:start position:0%
I hope you uh hope you send it on its
 
05:08:35.150 --> 05:08:35.160 align:start position:0%
way to finance for the senate or well
 
05:08:36.288 --> 05:08:36.298 align:start position:0%
with the other body we're not supposed
 
05:08:38.090 --> 05:08:38.100 align:start position:0%
to mention or uh
 
05:08:40.128 --> 05:08:40.138 align:start position:0%
and open to the governor's desk we can
 
05:08:42.110 --> 05:08:42.120 align:start position:0%
sign it and get more kids fed so that's
 
05:08:43.610 --> 05:08:43.620 align:start position:0%
what I have to say thank you very much
 
05:08:45.350 --> 05:08:45.360 align:start position:0%
representative are there questions from
 
05:08:47.990 --> 05:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
representative Horrigan yeah
 
05:08:50.270 --> 05:08:50.280 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you
 
05:08:54.250 --> 05:08:54.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:57.410 --> 05:08:57.420 align:start position:0%
a correction well why don't we wait and
 
05:08:58.910 --> 05:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
let the other people are waiting first
 
05:09:04.310 --> 05:09:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:08.050 --> 05:09:08.060 align:start position:0%
yeah okay let's go on the next one
 
05:09:13.128 --> 05:09:13.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:16.610 --> 05:09:16.620 align:start position:0%
or Laura I know it was Lara Laura Laura
 
05:09:16.620 --> 05:09:23.030 align:start position:0%
or Laura I know it was Lara Laura Laura
okay

05:09:23.030 --> 05:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:39.110 --> 05:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:41.330 --> 05:09:41.340 align:start position:0%
go ahead thank you chairman Ladd and
 
05:09:43.730 --> 05:09:43.740 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I provided you
 
05:09:45.410 --> 05:09:45.420 align:start position:0%
with written testimony and sort of a
 
05:09:48.830 --> 05:09:48.840 align:start position:0%
raft of uh the a summary of the research
 
05:09:50.990 --> 05:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
that's available on the benefits of
 
05:09:52.490 --> 05:09:52.500 align:start position:0%
School meals so I'll just keep my
 
05:09:54.650 --> 05:09:54.660 align:start position:0%
comments brief
 
05:09:56.570 --> 05:09:56.580 align:start position:0%
um School meals are essential to Student
 
05:09:59.208 --> 05:09:59.218 align:start position:0%
Health learning and behavior
 
05:09:59.218 --> 05:10:00.830 align:start position:0%
Health learning and behavior
um

05:10:00.830 --> 05:10:00.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:10:03.110 --> 05:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
so I'm not sure if I said Laura Milliken
 
05:10:04.430 --> 05:10:04.440 align:start position:0%
I'm the executive director of New
 
05:10:06.948 --> 05:10:06.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hunger Solutions I'm sorry so
 
05:10:09.288 --> 05:10:09.298 align:start position:0%
um uh School meals are essential to
 
05:10:11.030 --> 05:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
Student Health learning and behavior
 
05:10:13.128 --> 05:10:13.138 align:start position:0%
they improve student academic
 
05:10:15.170 --> 05:10:15.180 align:start position:0%
performance and health both in the short
 
05:10:17.270 --> 05:10:17.280 align:start position:0%
and long term and I provided you with a
 
05:10:21.110 --> 05:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
lot of research that backs that up
 
05:10:23.990 --> 05:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
um and it School meals decrease food
 
05:10:25.610 --> 05:10:25.620 align:start position:0%
insecurity and that's especially
 
05:10:27.530 --> 05:10:27.540 align:start position:0%
important right now because in the last
 
05:10:31.670 --> 05:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
census household pulse 177
 
05:10:34.070 --> 05:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
000 New Hampshire households with
 
05:10:36.410 --> 05:10:36.420 align:start position:0%
children said that they did not have
 
05:10:37.910 --> 05:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
sufficient food
 
05:10:41.330 --> 05:10:41.340 align:start position:0%
that's an increase of 30 000 since this
 
05:10:42.650 --> 05:10:42.660 align:start position:0%
past August
 
05:10:44.990 --> 05:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
so it's critical that all children can
 
05:10:48.410 --> 05:10:48.420 align:start position:0%
access meals in schools for many uh food
 
05:10:50.890 --> 05:10:50.900 align:start position:0%
insecure families for the their children
 
05:10:53.570 --> 05:10:53.580 align:start position:0%
those two meals in school are the only
 
05:10:56.570 --> 05:10:56.580 align:start position:0%
meals that they're eating all day
 
05:10:59.030 --> 05:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
um investments in child health and
 
05:11:01.250 --> 05:11:01.260 align:start position:0%
academic success and investment in our
 
05:11:03.590 --> 05:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
future so I urge you to support the bill
 
05:11:05.390 --> 05:11:05.400 align:start position:0%
so that all New Hampshire children can
 
05:11:07.970 --> 05:11:07.980 align:start position:0%
have an equal opportunity to succeed and
 
05:11:07.980 --> 05:11:09.770 align:start position:0%
have an equal opportunity to succeed and
thrive

05:11:09.770 --> 05:11:09.780 align:start position:0%
thrive
 
05:11:12.050 --> 05:11:12.060 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh are there any
 
05:11:15.890 --> 05:11:15.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:18.110 --> 05:11:18.120 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for your written
 
05:11:19.788 --> 05:11:19.798 align:start position:0%
report here appreciate it of course
 
05:11:22.730 --> 05:11:22.740 align:start position:0%
thank you so much
 
05:11:24.770 --> 05:11:24.780 align:start position:0%
and we have Becky Wilson then we're
 
05:11:25.970 --> 05:11:25.980 align:start position:0%
going to follow it up at danwood
 
05:11:34.070 --> 05:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:35.868 --> 05:11:35.878 align:start position:0%
good afternoon for the record Becky
 
05:11:37.070 --> 05:11:37.080 align:start position:0%
Wilson of the New Hampshire school
 
05:11:39.770 --> 05:11:39.780 align:start position:0%
boards Association uh we are in support
 
05:11:43.910 --> 05:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
of House Bill 429 at our 2022 delegate
 
05:11:46.128 --> 05:11:46.138 align:start position:0%
assembly our members passed a resolution
 
05:11:49.250 --> 05:11:49.260 align:start position:0%
that focused solely on supporting any
 
05:11:50.810 --> 05:11:50.820 align:start position:0%
legislation for state and federal
 
05:11:53.270 --> 05:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
government to seek and provide viable
 
05:11:55.190 --> 05:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
sustainable and permanent funding to
 
05:11:57.770 --> 05:11:57.780 align:start position:0%
provide School breakfast and lunch at no
 
05:11:59.750 --> 05:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
cost to all students and while this bill
 
05:12:03.050 --> 05:12:03.060 align:start position:0%
is not specific to ensuring that there
 
05:12:05.750 --> 05:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
is no cost to school districts per se it
 
05:12:08.570 --> 05:12:08.580 align:start position:0%
does cover the fact that we want our
 
05:12:10.128 --> 05:12:10.138 align:start position:0%
students to be fed I will not go into
 
05:12:12.530 --> 05:12:12.540 align:start position:0%
all of the research because you've
 
05:12:14.030 --> 05:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
already heard a lot of that and you've
 
05:12:15.530 --> 05:12:15.540 align:start position:0%
had a very long day and many people have
 
05:12:17.690 --> 05:12:17.700 align:start position:0%
already testified on the benefits of
 
05:12:19.788 --> 05:12:19.798 align:start position:0%
feeding all of our students I will say
 
05:12:21.770 --> 05:12:21.780 align:start position:0%
that during the pandemic when there was
 
05:12:23.690 --> 05:12:23.700 align:start position:0%
waivers and relaxation of the
 
05:12:25.610 --> 05:12:25.620 align:start position:0%
eligibility documentation that was
 
05:12:27.530 --> 05:12:27.540 align:start position:0%
required for free and reduced lunch we
 
05:12:30.708 --> 05:12:30.718 align:start position:0%
saw across the state enormous gains in
 
05:12:32.570 --> 05:12:32.580 align:start position:0%
the number of students that would access
 
05:12:34.430 --> 05:12:34.440 align:start position:0%
breakfast and lunch programs that are
 
05:12:36.590 --> 05:12:36.600 align:start position:0%
already in existence and it is the
 
05:12:38.510 --> 05:12:38.520 align:start position:0%
desire of our members to continue that
 
05:12:41.208 --> 05:12:41.218 align:start position:0%
and to try to remove any stigma that
 
05:12:43.850 --> 05:12:43.860 align:start position:0%
might affect students participation in
 
05:12:47.030 --> 05:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
those programs we would ask potentially
 
05:12:48.650 --> 05:12:48.660 align:start position:0%
I think it's already been brought up
 
05:12:51.110 --> 05:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
that perhaps some kind of a amendment in
 
05:12:52.850 --> 05:12:52.860 align:start position:0%
terms of if you are a district that is
 
05:12:54.830 --> 05:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
already providing a breakfast or lunch
 
05:12:56.628 --> 05:12:56.638 align:start position:0%
program outside of the federal breakfast
 
05:12:58.550 --> 05:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
and lunch program that there would be
 
05:13:00.830 --> 05:13:00.840 align:start position:0%
some sort of waiver to allow you to
 
05:13:03.350 --> 05:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
continue to do that at the local cost of
 
05:13:04.490 --> 05:13:04.500 align:start position:0%
the district that they've already
 
05:13:06.170 --> 05:13:06.180 align:start position:0%
incurred if that is something that they
 
05:13:08.868 --> 05:13:08.878 align:start position:0%
wish to do as long as you are providing
 
05:13:11.448 --> 05:13:11.458 align:start position:0%
breakfast is available to all students
 
05:13:15.250 --> 05:13:15.260 align:start position:0%
at a free or reduced cost as appropriate
 
05:13:18.770 --> 05:13:18.780 align:start position:0%
we would also I'm not sure what the
 
05:13:21.050 --> 05:13:21.060 align:start position:0%
reason is specifically that the 27
 
05:13:24.288 --> 05:13:24.298 align:start position:0%
schools are not providing breakfast or
 
05:13:26.390 --> 05:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
lunch we do have some districts in New
 
05:13:28.250 --> 05:13:28.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that do not operate a school I
 
05:13:29.810 --> 05:13:29.820 align:start position:0%
don't know if somehow that is being
 
05:13:31.670 --> 05:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
incorporated into those numbers or if
 
05:13:33.590 --> 05:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
those are specifically schools that are
 
05:13:36.230 --> 05:13:36.240 align:start position:0%
not providing those programs but we
 
05:13:37.310 --> 05:13:37.320 align:start position:0%
would just maybe ask for some
 
05:13:40.550 --> 05:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
clarification around that to ensure that
 
05:13:42.470 --> 05:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
we're getting the accurate data out
 
05:13:43.610 --> 05:13:43.620 align:start position:0%
there and I'm happy to take any
 
05:13:45.948 --> 05:13:45.958 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much are there
 
05:13:47.150 --> 05:13:47.160 align:start position:0%
questions for the school boards
 
05:13:47.160 --> 05:13:49.490 align:start position:0%
questions for the school boards
Association

Association
 
05:13:54.050 --> 05:13:54.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:55.670 --> 05:13:55.680 align:start position:0%
ripson Woodcock do you have something
 
05:13:57.350 --> 05:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
you want to
 
05:14:01.310 --> 05:14:01.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:03.470 --> 05:14:03.480 align:start position:0%
thank you representative lad I apologize
 
05:14:05.230 --> 05:14:05.240 align:start position:0%
for coming back uh representative
 
05:14:08.990 --> 05:14:09.000 align:start position:0%
Harrigan mentioned the number of 153 of
 
05:14:10.730 --> 05:14:10.740 align:start position:0%
schools in the state that we're
 
05:14:13.610 --> 05:14:13.620 align:start position:0%
operating uh breakfast or lunch that was
 
05:14:16.010 --> 05:14:16.020 align:start position:0%
an error representative Ellison and Miss
 
05:14:19.070 --> 05:14:19.080 align:start position:0%
Rambo from doe corrected that and
 
05:14:21.050 --> 05:14:21.060 align:start position:0%
brought us the correct data today all of
 
05:14:22.850 --> 05:14:22.860 align:start position:0%
you have the correct data and the
 
05:14:24.770 --> 05:14:24.780 align:start position:0%
financial note that came out and that
 
05:14:27.530 --> 05:14:27.540 align:start position:0%
number is six not 153 but you want to go
 
05:14:29.030 --> 05:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
out over the Airways as being the
 
05:14:31.010 --> 05:14:31.020 align:start position:0%
incorrect information we got that that's
 
05:14:33.890 --> 05:14:33.900 align:start position:0%
right thank you you're welcome um I I do
 
05:14:35.448 --> 05:14:35.458 align:start position:0%
have one question of the department
 
05:14:42.230 --> 05:14:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:42.240 --> 05:14:44.030 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:14:44.030 --> 05:14:44.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:14:47.030 --> 05:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
it should be a very simple question for
 
05:14:50.690 --> 05:14:50.700 align:start position:0%
you in the bill on lines of four and
 
05:14:53.390 --> 05:14:53.400 align:start position:0%
five it says the State Board shall
 
05:14:57.170 --> 05:14:57.180 align:start position:0%
establish minimum nutritional standards
 
05:14:59.570 --> 05:14:59.580 align:start position:0%
is the state board setting the standards
 
05:15:01.910 --> 05:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
or are the state are the standards set
 
05:15:04.850 --> 05:15:04.860 align:start position:0%
by the National School breakfast program
 
05:15:06.470 --> 05:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
um I believe that would be a question
 
05:15:08.208 --> 05:15:08.218 align:start position:0%
for the State Board and not the
 
05:15:09.890 --> 05:15:09.900 align:start position:0%
Department of Education
 
05:15:09.900 --> 05:15:11.420 align:start position:0%
Department of Education
okay

05:15:11.420 --> 05:15:11.430 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:15:11.430 --> 05:15:14.090 align:start position:0%
okay
[Music]

05:15:14.090 --> 05:15:14.100 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:15:17.090 --> 05:15:17.100 align:start position:0%
represent luck is
 
05:15:19.310 --> 05:15:19.320 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping you can answer this question
 
05:15:22.128 --> 05:15:22.138 align:start position:0%
or might have a hint
 
05:15:24.590 --> 05:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
um do you have any idea why the schools
 
05:15:27.230 --> 05:15:27.240 align:start position:0%
who aren't participating in the
 
05:15:30.010 --> 05:15:30.020 align:start position:0%
breakfast or lunch programs are doing so
 
05:15:32.628 --> 05:15:32.638 align:start position:0%
sure I can answer that thank you for the
 
05:15:32.638 --> 05:15:33.948 align:start position:0%
sure I can answer that thank you for the
question

05:15:33.948 --> 05:15:33.958 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:15:37.550 --> 05:15:37.560 align:start position:0%
um there if in the um the fiscal note
 
05:15:39.530 --> 05:15:39.540 align:start position:0%
you'll see that there are a number of
 
05:15:41.390 --> 05:15:41.400 align:start position:0%
different factors that could come into
 
05:15:43.490 --> 05:15:43.500 align:start position:0%
play on why a school might not
 
05:15:45.948 --> 05:15:45.958 align:start position:0%
participate in the breakfast program it
 
05:15:47.990 --> 05:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
could be due to Staffing it could be due
 
05:15:52.788 --> 05:15:52.798 align:start position:0%
to the timing of the buses this the not
 
05:15:54.948 --> 05:15:54.958 align:start position:0%
only the kitchen staff or nutrition
 
05:15:57.350 --> 05:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
staff that's available but the teachers
 
05:15:59.990 --> 05:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
to watch the cafeteria and watch those
 
05:16:01.750 --> 05:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
students so it's important to know that
 
05:16:04.910 --> 05:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
for the breakfast program there are a
 
05:16:06.590 --> 05:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
wide variety of factors that come into
 
05:16:10.550 --> 05:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
play that might not be as challenging at
 
05:16:12.830 --> 05:16:12.840 align:start position:0%
lunchtime when the school day has
 
05:16:15.230 --> 05:16:15.240 align:start position:0%
started and you're already in your daily
 
05:16:17.030 --> 05:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
routines for that so it's just important
 
05:16:19.430 --> 05:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
to think about all of those things for
 
05:16:22.430 --> 05:16:22.440 align:start position:0%
um for that program for breakfast
 
05:16:22.440 --> 05:16:29.948 align:start position:0%
um for that program for breakfast
foreign

05:16:29.948 --> 05:16:29.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:32.810 --> 05:16:32.820 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry thank you
 
05:16:36.350 --> 05:16:36.360 align:start position:0%
this would mandate that they provided
 
05:16:36.360 --> 05:16:37.788 align:start position:0%
this would mandate that they provided
um so

05:16:37.788 --> 05:16:37.798 align:start position:0%
um so
 
05:16:40.310 --> 05:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
is there additional expense are there
 
05:16:42.590 --> 05:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
things that that we have to do to try to
 
05:16:45.230 --> 05:16:45.240 align:start position:0%
help mitigate those issues because those
 
05:16:46.788 --> 05:16:46.798 align:start position:0%
issues are real
 
05:16:48.890 --> 05:16:48.900 align:start position:0%
there are reasons they're not providing
 
05:16:51.590 --> 05:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
it so how are we dealing with that in
 
05:16:53.628 --> 05:16:53.638 align:start position:0%
now mandating that they're going to
 
05:16:55.490 --> 05:16:55.500 align:start position:0%
provide breakfast thank you for the
 
05:16:58.610 --> 05:16:58.620 align:start position:0%
question um so also in the fiscal note
 
05:17:01.550 --> 05:17:01.560 align:start position:0%
um the the costs due to being at the
 
05:17:04.070 --> 05:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
local level are indeterminable at the
 
05:17:06.470 --> 05:17:06.480 align:start position:0%
Department of Education but all of those
 
05:17:09.470 --> 05:17:09.480 align:start position:0%
factors would come into play whether it
 
05:17:11.270 --> 05:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
be that they need additional staff for
 
05:17:13.970 --> 05:17:13.980 align:start position:0%
the breakfast time in the morning some
 
05:17:16.250 --> 05:17:16.260 align:start position:0%
of the schools only have the nutrition
 
05:17:18.470 --> 05:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
members for maybe staff members excuse
 
05:17:21.948 --> 05:17:21.958 align:start position:0%
me for four hours five hours so that
 
05:17:22.970 --> 05:17:22.980 align:start position:0%
would need to be taken into
 
05:17:26.330 --> 05:17:26.340 align:start position:0%
consideration as well so for us at the
 
05:17:28.430 --> 05:17:28.440 align:start position:0%
Department of Education those
 
05:17:30.770 --> 05:17:30.780 align:start position:0%
um expenses would be indeterminable for
 
05:17:34.250 --> 05:17:34.260 align:start position:0%
us to figure those out thank you so
 
05:17:36.770 --> 05:17:36.780 align:start position:0%
Kelly before you get off the hook here
 
05:17:38.750 --> 05:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
um working with this uh I'd like to have
 
05:17:40.368 --> 05:17:40.378 align:start position:0%
some information on the question I asked
 
05:17:42.288 --> 05:17:42.298 align:start position:0%
them the National School breakfast
 
05:17:46.250 --> 05:17:46.260 align:start position:0%
program is administered through the
 
05:17:47.990 --> 05:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
the department there must be something
 
05:17:49.750 --> 05:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
coming through the department
 
05:17:53.350 --> 05:17:53.360 align:start position:0%
and if so then if we're talking about
 
05:17:56.330 --> 05:17:56.340 align:start position:0%
the State Board having to set these
 
05:17:58.730 --> 05:17:58.740 align:start position:0%
minimum nutritional standards I would
 
05:18:01.250 --> 05:18:01.260 align:start position:0%
assume there must be standards set by
 
05:18:04.610 --> 05:18:04.620 align:start position:0%
the feds in terms of what is the
 
05:18:07.550 --> 05:18:07.560 align:start position:0%
National School breakfast program and
 
05:18:10.190 --> 05:18:10.200 align:start position:0%
I'm just you know if if this law says
 
05:18:12.830 --> 05:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
right here or this bill says that we the
 
05:18:14.750 --> 05:18:14.760 align:start position:0%
State Board is going to set that does
 
05:18:17.030 --> 05:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
the State Board have the expertise to
 
05:18:19.610 --> 05:18:19.620 align:start position:0%
set that if in fact you know if we're
 
05:18:22.190 --> 05:18:22.200 align:start position:0%
going to be involved within are they
 
05:18:24.170 --> 05:18:24.180 align:start position:0%
allowed to do it even if we're going to
 
05:18:25.970 --> 05:18:25.980 align:start position:0%
be a part of the national breakfast
 
05:18:29.270 --> 05:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
program which is federally directed so
 
05:18:30.350 --> 05:18:30.360 align:start position:0%
there seems to be a little bit of
 
05:18:32.090 --> 05:18:32.100 align:start position:0%
conflict here and I'd like to see some
 
05:18:33.708 --> 05:18:33.718 align:start position:0%
resolution on this before we have to act
 
05:18:37.070 --> 05:18:37.080 align:start position:0%
on it I will get an answer for you
 
05:18:38.810 --> 05:18:38.820 align:start position:0%
um and I'm not sure if the state board
 
05:18:41.330 --> 05:18:41.340 align:start position:0%
can um can speak to that but I will I
 
05:18:43.070 --> 05:18:43.080 align:start position:0%
will look and and work on the answer for
 
05:18:45.110 --> 05:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
that Allison just had his hand up and I
 
05:18:47.050 --> 05:18:47.060 align:start position:0%
know he's involved with this all right
 
05:18:49.550 --> 05:18:49.560 align:start position:0%
hopefully that I think that the State
 
05:18:51.770 --> 05:18:51.780 align:start position:0%
Board is already written into the
 
05:18:54.250 --> 05:18:54.260 align:start position:0%
legislation at this point
 
05:18:57.590 --> 05:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
it doesn't doesn't deal with the issue
 
05:18:59.810 --> 05:18:59.820 align:start position:0%
that should worry about what's the real
 
05:19:01.730 --> 05:19:01.740 align:start position:0%
function of the State Board of Civic
 
05:19:03.890 --> 05:19:03.900 align:start position:0%
nutritional standards so I think in the
 
05:19:09.830 --> 05:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:12.350 --> 05:19:12.360 align:start position:0%
yeah okay thank you
 
05:19:15.350 --> 05:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
so I will work on clarification on that
 
05:19:15.360 --> 05:19:16.670 align:start position:0%
so I will work on clarification on that
clarifications

05:19:16.670 --> 05:19:16.680 align:start position:0%
clarifications
 
05:19:19.368 --> 05:19:19.378 align:start position:0%
um is just simply a granola bar
 
05:19:21.770 --> 05:19:21.780 align:start position:0%
I will get clarification for you on that
 
05:19:24.948 --> 05:19:24.958 align:start position:0%
um to your question on the standards for
 
05:19:27.650 --> 05:19:27.660 align:start position:0%
the USDA program yes just like just like
 
05:19:29.628 --> 05:19:29.638 align:start position:0%
lunch there are standards for um for
 
05:19:31.550 --> 05:19:31.560 align:start position:0%
breakfast for the USDA program yeah
 
05:19:34.430 --> 05:19:34.440 align:start position:0%
thank you that's exactly where I'm going
 
05:19:37.430 --> 05:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
05:19:39.650 --> 05:19:39.660 align:start position:0%
yes reps in balbooni
 
05:19:41.628 --> 05:19:41.638 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
05:19:43.490 --> 05:19:43.500 align:start position:0%
um just another question to follow up on
 
05:19:45.650 --> 05:19:45.660 align:start position:0%
yeah so those six districts that don't
 
05:19:45.660 --> 05:19:46.430 align:start position:0%
yeah so those six districts that don't
have

05:19:46.430 --> 05:19:46.440 align:start position:0%
have
 
05:19:49.010 --> 05:19:49.020 align:start position:0%
um either program right now the costs
 
05:19:51.830 --> 05:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
will be borne by those districts than
 
05:19:54.890 --> 05:19:54.900 align:start position:0%
the full costs to assume the programs
 
05:19:58.670 --> 05:19:58.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:01.610 --> 05:20:01.620 align:start position:0%
so just a quick follow-up
 
05:20:03.470 --> 05:20:03.480 align:start position:0%
um so they would actually have to
 
05:20:06.650 --> 05:20:06.660 align:start position:0%
prepare for that in advance and go to
 
05:20:09.770 --> 05:20:09.780 align:start position:0%
the towns with a budget increase
 
05:20:12.288 --> 05:20:12.298 align:start position:0%
done that's correct as the bill is
 
05:20:14.570 --> 05:20:14.580 align:start position:0%
written those six schools would be
 
05:20:17.510 --> 05:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
affected by the bill correct all right
 
05:20:19.670 --> 05:20:19.680 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Tanner
 
05:20:21.230 --> 05:20:21.240 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
05:20:21.240 --> 05:20:22.730 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
question

05:20:22.730 --> 05:20:22.740 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:20:26.030 --> 05:20:26.040 align:start position:0%
um if if those schools signed up for the
 
05:20:28.490 --> 05:20:28.500 align:start position:0%
federal school program how much money
 
05:20:30.890 --> 05:20:30.900 align:start position:0%
would it cost them per pupil for a
 
05:20:33.230 --> 05:20:33.240 align:start position:0%
breakfast meal and for a lunch meal do
 
05:20:35.510 --> 05:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
you have any idea unfortunately at the
 
05:20:37.070 --> 05:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
Department of Education that is
 
05:20:39.650 --> 05:20:39.660 align:start position:0%
indeterminable all the local that's
 
05:20:42.770 --> 05:20:42.780 align:start position:0%
local control for the cost per price how
 
05:20:45.110 --> 05:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
much it would cost per student again
 
05:20:48.110 --> 05:20:48.120 align:start position:0%
thinking of all of those factors if they
 
05:20:50.390 --> 05:20:50.400 align:start position:0%
are not currently running a program if
 
05:20:53.150 --> 05:20:53.160 align:start position:0%
they don't currently have a kitchen they
 
05:20:55.788 --> 05:20:55.798 align:start position:0%
would need to implement all of those
 
05:20:58.788 --> 05:20:58.798 align:start position:0%
um those things and Equipment staff
 
05:21:00.530 --> 05:21:00.540 align:start position:0%
there's a number of things that that
 
05:21:03.350 --> 05:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
could go into to that to that cost for
 
05:21:07.150 --> 05:21:07.160 align:start position:0%
them to start a program thank you
 
05:21:09.410 --> 05:21:09.420 align:start position:0%
representative leckers
 
05:21:13.430 --> 05:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
just for clarification so then the that
 
05:21:17.208 --> 05:21:17.218 align:start position:0%
estimate on the fiscal note
 
05:21:17.218 --> 05:21:18.948 align:start position:0%
estimate on the fiscal note
um

05:21:18.948 --> 05:21:18.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:21:18.958 --> 05:21:21.110 align:start position:0%
um
that's

05:21:21.110 --> 05:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
that's
 
05:21:25.070 --> 05:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
that's what does that cover and then
 
05:21:25.080 --> 05:21:25.850 align:start position:0%
that's what does that cover and then
um

05:21:25.850 --> 05:21:25.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:21:28.910 --> 05:21:28.920 align:start position:0%
so then our end for the rest of the cost
 
05:21:30.590 --> 05:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
for somebody who has to set up a kitchen
 
05:21:32.570 --> 05:21:32.580 align:start position:0%
or whatever they have to do
 
05:21:35.150 --> 05:21:35.160 align:start position:0%
is that then where is that been an
 
05:21:36.590 --> 05:21:36.600 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandate
 
05:21:39.770 --> 05:21:39.780 align:start position:0%
or is this money that's that's the state
 
05:21:42.830 --> 05:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
cost here that's in the fiscal note is
 
05:21:44.930 --> 05:21:44.940 align:start position:0%
that to cover it I'm not sure what that
 
05:21:46.550 --> 05:21:46.560 align:start position:0%
covers sure
 
05:21:48.050 --> 05:21:48.060 align:start position:0%
um in The Narrative of the fiscal note
 
05:21:50.990 --> 05:21:51.000 align:start position:0%
there um is a state expenditures and
 
05:21:52.788 --> 05:21:52.798 align:start position:0%
then a local expenditures
 
05:21:54.470 --> 05:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
um the money that is associated with
 
05:21:56.208 --> 05:21:56.218 align:start position:0%
that and please note this fiscal note
 
05:21:58.128 --> 05:21:58.138 align:start position:0%
was also written with the charter
 
05:21:59.570 --> 05:21:59.580 align:start position:0%
schools still
 
05:22:01.490 --> 05:22:01.500 align:start position:0%
um in place there so that's why you'll
 
05:22:01.500 --> 05:22:02.570 align:start position:0%
um in place there so that's why you'll
see

05:22:02.570 --> 05:22:02.580 align:start position:0%
see
 
05:22:04.610 --> 05:22:04.620 align:start position:0%
um the the need for two additional staff
 
05:22:07.270 --> 05:22:07.280 align:start position:0%
members at the Department of Education
 
05:22:11.150 --> 05:22:11.160 align:start position:0%
to manage those additional charter
 
05:22:14.270 --> 05:22:14.280 align:start position:0%
schools that would would need to operate
 
05:22:17.690 --> 05:22:17.700 align:start position:0%
for that so the state expenditures that
 
05:22:19.250 --> 05:22:19.260 align:start position:0%
are listed on the fiscal note are
 
05:22:21.708 --> 05:22:21.718 align:start position:0%
specifically for what it would be at the
 
05:22:23.570 --> 05:22:23.580 align:start position:0%
Department of Education and not at the
 
05:22:24.530 --> 05:22:24.540 align:start position:0%
local level
 
05:22:27.530 --> 05:22:27.540 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you for the
 
05:22:27.540 --> 05:22:28.550 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you for the
questions

05:22:28.550 --> 05:22:28.560 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:22:31.310 --> 05:22:31.320 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Kelly thank you
 
05:22:34.368 --> 05:22:34.378 align:start position:0%
so I have no further pink cards on this
 
05:22:37.250 --> 05:22:37.260 align:start position:0%
one so we are going to close the hearing
 
05:22:38.930 --> 05:22:38.940 align:start position:0%
and we're a little bit late but we're
 
05:22:41.390 --> 05:22:41.400 align:start position:0%
going to take about five minutes here
 
05:22:43.550 --> 05:22:43.560 align:start position:0%
for those that get up for a second here
 
05:22:45.890 --> 05:22:45.900 align:start position:0%
and and we'll come back in about five
 
05:22:45.900 --> 05:22:57.310 align:start position:0%
and and we'll come back in about five
minutes

05:22:57.310 --> 05:22:57.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:18.250 --> 05:23:18.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:20.570 --> 05:23:20.580 align:start position:0%
I bet you that's where I bet you'll be
 
05:23:22.090 --> 05:23:22.100 align:start position:0%
helping file somewhere along the way
 
05:31:58.448 --> 05:31:58.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:01.310 --> 05:32:01.320 align:start position:0%
okay so I'd like to go ahead and open up
 
05:32:03.948 --> 05:32:03.958 align:start position:0%
the hearing for 424 this is uh relative
 
05:32:06.470 --> 05:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
to school lunch payment policies and
 
05:32:08.448 --> 05:32:08.458 align:start position:0%
recognize guys represent Tim Horrigan
 
05:32:18.050 --> 05:32:18.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:20.510 --> 05:32:20.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I continue to be
 
05:32:22.010 --> 05:32:22.020 align:start position:0%
representative Tim Horrigan I continue
 
05:32:23.868 --> 05:32:23.878 align:start position:0%
to lift something unexpectedly has
 
05:32:25.310 --> 05:32:25.320 align:start position:0%
happened I'm still continuing to
 
05:32:26.810 --> 05:32:26.820 align:start position:0%
represent Stratford County District 10
 
05:32:30.050 --> 05:32:30.060 align:start position:0%
which is now just the town of Durham
 
05:32:33.650 --> 05:32:33.660 align:start position:0%
and uh actually this bill this exact
 
05:32:35.510 --> 05:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
same bill almost passed three years ago
 
05:32:37.368 --> 05:32:37.378 align:start position:0%
it uh passed on the consent calendar
 
05:32:39.288 --> 05:32:39.298 align:start position:0%
during the marathon session before the
 
05:32:42.530 --> 05:32:42.540 align:start position:0%
pandemic hit and then it kind of uh got
 
05:32:44.330 --> 05:32:44.340 align:start position:0%
lost in the shuffle after the pandemic
 
05:32:46.250 --> 05:32:46.260 align:start position:0%
and the Senate tabled it
 
05:32:47.930 --> 05:32:47.940 align:start position:0%
then I tried again the next year with
 
05:32:49.910 --> 05:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
less success but maybe the third time
 
05:32:52.610 --> 05:32:52.620 align:start position:0%
will be the charm um it's fairly simple
 
05:32:56.270 --> 05:32:56.280 align:start position:0%
it uh HB 424 requires students to serve
 
05:32:58.128 --> 05:32:58.138 align:start position:0%
the same lunch to every child regardless
 
05:32:59.690 --> 05:32:59.700 align:start position:0%
of whether or not his or her family
 
05:33:02.810 --> 05:33:02.820 align:start position:0%
already owes a lunch debt and so
 
05:33:04.670 --> 05:33:04.680 align:start position:0%
unfortunately this is a growing problem
 
05:33:08.390 --> 05:33:08.400 align:start position:0%
especially with the economic turmoil of
 
05:33:10.610 --> 05:33:10.620 align:start position:0%
the last few years but um doesn't
 
05:33:12.470 --> 05:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
abolish the humility practice for
 
05:33:14.270 --> 05:33:14.280 align:start position:0%
providing a separate and not quite equal
 
05:33:16.970 --> 05:33:16.980 align:start position:0%
meal to a child who cannot pay for his
 
05:33:18.050 --> 05:33:18.060 align:start position:0%
or her lunch
 
05:33:20.708 --> 05:33:20.718 align:start position:0%
and it also um
 
05:33:23.270 --> 05:33:23.280 align:start position:0%
prohibits public identification or
 
05:33:25.788 --> 05:33:25.798 align:start position:0%
stigmatation of a student who's welcomes
 
05:33:28.070 --> 05:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
parents but who cannot pay for a meal or
 
05:33:31.550 --> 05:33:31.560 align:start position:0%
who owes a eight meal debt no matter how
 
05:33:33.288 --> 05:33:33.298 align:start position:0%
subtle you try to make it uh kids are
 
05:33:35.208 --> 05:33:35.218 align:start position:0%
very sensitive to a Nuance especially
 
05:33:37.970 --> 05:33:37.980 align:start position:0%
when it comes to issues of you know
 
05:33:42.410 --> 05:33:42.420 align:start position:0%
Financial issues and the it's a it also
 
05:33:42.420 --> 05:33:43.368 align:start position:0%
Financial issues and the it's a it also
prohibits

05:33:43.368 --> 05:33:43.378 align:start position:0%
prohibits
 
05:33:45.410 --> 05:33:45.420 align:start position:0%
so they can't force privileged child who
 
05:33:47.448 --> 05:33:47.458 align:start position:0%
cannot pay a meal from a Rose of meal
 
05:33:49.310 --> 05:33:49.320 align:start position:0%
death from being forced to do chores or
 
05:33:50.750 --> 05:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
other work to pay for meals unless
 
05:33:52.730 --> 05:33:52.740 align:start position:0%
chores or other work are required of all
 
05:33:54.170 --> 05:33:54.180 align:start position:0%
students so
 
05:33:56.330 --> 05:33:56.340 align:start position:0%
and I don't actually know many cases
 
05:33:59.150 --> 05:33:59.160 align:start position:0%
cases of that but um and also it
 
05:34:00.770 --> 05:34:00.780 align:start position:0%
requires schools to get Direct
 
05:34:02.930 --> 05:34:02.940 align:start position:0%
Communications about a child's meal debt
 
05:34:04.788 --> 05:34:04.798 align:start position:0%
to a parent or guardian and not to the
 
05:34:06.470 --> 05:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
student which
 
05:34:08.090 --> 05:34:08.100 align:start position:0%
aside from not embarrassing a student
 
05:34:10.070 --> 05:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
that's a good practice because it's more
 
05:34:12.350 --> 05:34:12.360 align:start position:0%
likely to get to the uh the parent if
 
05:34:14.270 --> 05:34:14.280 align:start position:0%
you contact them directly rather than
 
05:34:16.368 --> 05:34:16.378 align:start position:0%
you know sending a note with the
 
05:34:18.948 --> 05:34:18.958 align:start position:0%
children and you know there's
 
05:34:21.230 --> 05:34:21.240 align:start position:0%
we haven't we haven't had the worship
 
05:34:23.510 --> 05:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
abuses here in New Hampshire but in
 
05:34:25.910 --> 05:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
other states some very humiliating uh
 
05:34:27.590 --> 05:34:27.600 align:start position:0%
things things have happened you know
 
05:34:27.600 --> 05:34:28.310 align:start position:0%
things things have happened you know
even

05:34:28.310 --> 05:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
even
 
05:34:30.430 --> 05:34:30.440 align:start position:0%
I think I'd say even though
 
05:34:33.170 --> 05:34:33.180 align:start position:0%
sometimes even one school district even
 
05:34:35.270 --> 05:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
stamped on the uh in another state
 
05:34:37.250 --> 05:34:37.260 align:start position:0%
stamped like a message in the forehand
 
05:34:40.910 --> 05:34:40.920 align:start position:0%
was something like like I owe lunch I
 
05:34:43.910 --> 05:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
owe my old lunch debt which is like just
 
05:34:46.550 --> 05:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
you know not a not a good thing to do so
 
05:34:49.010 --> 05:34:49.020 align:start position:0%
this is um
 
05:34:50.810 --> 05:34:50.820 align:start position:0%
Bill uh it's been passed in other states
 
05:34:52.010 --> 05:34:52.020 align:start position:0%
I think there's even some federal
 
05:34:54.470 --> 05:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
legislation along these lines so I think
 
05:34:55.850 --> 05:34:55.860 align:start position:0%
it's a pretty uh pretty simple thing
 
05:34:57.590 --> 05:34:57.600 align:start position:0%
that adds to the protections that are
 
05:34:59.150 --> 05:34:59.160 align:start position:0%
already in place in
 
05:35:02.510 --> 05:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
in the in the in the rsas and I uh urge
 
05:35:05.390 --> 05:35:05.400 align:start position:0%
you to uh do what we did in 2020 and and
 
05:35:08.930 --> 05:35:08.940 align:start position:0%
uh and passage preferably unanimously on
 
05:35:10.610 --> 05:35:10.620 align:start position:0%
the consent calendar would be nice but
 
05:35:12.830 --> 05:35:12.840 align:start position:0%
as long as you pass it I'm happy so I'd
 
05:35:14.570 --> 05:35:14.580 align:start position:0%
be also happy to take any questions
 
05:35:17.448 --> 05:35:17.458 align:start position:0%
should anyone have have any
 
05:35:19.550 --> 05:35:19.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much can I see are there
 
05:35:20.750 --> 05:35:20.760 align:start position:0%
any questions for representative Oregon
 
05:35:20.760 --> 05:35:23.628 align:start position:0%
any questions for representative Oregon
representative

05:35:23.628 --> 05:35:23.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:26.930 --> 05:35:26.940 align:start position:0%
yes I remember this Bill yes
 
05:35:26.940 --> 05:35:27.830 align:start position:0%
yes I remember this Bill yes
um

05:35:27.830 --> 05:35:27.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:35:30.170 --> 05:35:30.180 align:start position:0%
my question is and thank you for
 
05:35:31.970 --> 05:35:31.980 align:start position:0%
answering my question well I haven't
 
05:35:34.868 --> 05:35:34.878 align:start position:0%
done it yet but I probably will do
 
05:35:34.878 --> 05:35:36.770 align:start position:0%
done it yet but I probably will do
yes

05:35:36.770 --> 05:35:36.780 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:35:36.780 --> 05:35:37.390 align:start position:0%
yes
um

05:35:37.390 --> 05:35:37.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:35:41.330 --> 05:35:41.340 align:start position:0%
my question is are you aware of any
 
05:35:43.810 --> 05:35:43.820 align:start position:0%
issues that are currently taking place
 
05:35:47.448 --> 05:35:47.458 align:start position:0%
in our street because I seem to remember
 
05:35:49.910 --> 05:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
that when this was up before being told
 
05:35:53.270 --> 05:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
that this has already been taken care of
 
05:35:55.250 --> 05:35:55.260 align:start position:0%
and that it's not happening so I'm
 
05:35:55.260 --> 05:35:56.270 align:start position:0%
and that it's not happening so I'm
wondering

05:35:56.270 --> 05:35:56.280 align:start position:0%
wondering
 
05:35:59.390 --> 05:35:59.400 align:start position:0%
what you know of this
 
05:36:02.208 --> 05:36:02.218 align:start position:0%
I mean there's a there's already some
 
05:36:04.070 --> 05:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
some protections for these are very
 
05:36:06.170 --> 05:36:06.180 align:start position:0%
explicit protections these are certainly
 
05:36:08.090 --> 05:36:08.100 align:start position:0%
especially abusive practices that it
 
05:36:08.100 --> 05:36:09.250 align:start position:0%
especially abusive practices that it
would

05:36:09.250 --> 05:36:09.260 align:start position:0%
would
 
05:36:11.448 --> 05:36:11.458 align:start position:0%
specifically uh specifically
 
05:36:13.850 --> 05:36:13.860 align:start position:0%
specifically for beds and actually don't
 
05:36:13.860 --> 05:36:14.750 align:start position:0%
specifically for beds and actually don't
really

05:36:14.750 --> 05:36:14.760 align:start position:0%
really
 
05:36:16.310 --> 05:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
although I voted for the consent
 
05:36:19.070 --> 05:36:19.080 align:start position:0%
calendar when this failed in 2021 I
 
05:36:20.570 --> 05:36:20.580 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily agree with what the
 
05:36:22.610 --> 05:36:22.620 align:start position:0%
member who wrote the committee report
 
05:36:25.070 --> 05:36:25.080 align:start position:0%
said about it although
 
05:36:26.930 --> 05:36:26.940 align:start position:0%
she's no longer on this committee so I
 
05:36:28.128 --> 05:36:28.138 align:start position:0%
guess I don't have to worry that much
 
05:36:30.230 --> 05:36:30.240 align:start position:0%
about what she said but um I mean I
 
05:36:33.170 --> 05:36:33.180 align:start position:0%
think I think this is uh I think this is
 
05:36:34.610 --> 05:36:34.620 align:start position:0%
uh I think we got it right the first
 
05:36:36.770 --> 05:36:36.780 align:start position:0%
time in 2020 and we should uh we should
 
05:36:39.110 --> 05:36:39.120 align:start position:0%
pass this because our it's sort of
 
05:36:40.970 --> 05:36:40.980 align:start position:0%
addressing the existing law but but but
 
05:36:44.868 --> 05:36:44.878 align:start position:0%
not really and um certainly lunch lunch
 
05:36:47.448 --> 05:36:47.458 align:start position:0%
debt is uh it's it's a growing it's a
 
05:36:49.128 --> 05:36:49.138 align:start position:0%
growing problem uh you know it's a
 
05:36:50.690 --> 05:36:50.700 align:start position:0%
growing problem Nationwide here in New
 
05:36:53.390 --> 05:36:53.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire especially we had uh we had
 
05:36:54.650 --> 05:36:54.660 align:start position:0%
the free lunches when the federal
 
05:36:56.030 --> 05:36:56.040 align:start position:0%
funding was available during the
 
05:36:58.970 --> 05:36:58.980 align:start position:0%
pandemic and this doesn't restore the
 
05:37:00.350 --> 05:37:00.360 align:start position:0%
free lunches but that was an extremely
 
05:37:02.750 --> 05:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
popular program so if you get if you get
 
05:37:04.730 --> 05:37:04.740 align:start position:0%
a bill along those lines the parents
 
05:37:06.708 --> 05:37:06.718 align:start position:0%
will will love you if we will love us if
 
05:37:08.690 --> 05:37:08.700 align:start position:0%
we pass it but it um
 
05:37:11.868 --> 05:37:11.878 align:start position:0%
and so there's a is there a lot of a lot
 
05:37:13.250 --> 05:37:13.260 align:start position:0%
of the issue a lot of it is either
 
05:37:15.170 --> 05:37:15.180 align:start position:0%
family a lot of his families who are
 
05:37:17.690 --> 05:37:17.700 align:start position:0%
eligible for the reduced price meal but
 
05:37:19.310 --> 05:37:19.320 align:start position:0%
don't apply for it and then paying the
 
05:37:21.650 --> 05:37:21.660 align:start position:0%
full price meal and then are unable to
 
05:37:24.230 --> 05:37:24.240 align:start position:0%
pay for the full price meal because they
 
05:37:26.150 --> 05:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
underestimated uh
 
05:37:28.850 --> 05:37:28.860 align:start position:0%
how good their financial situation was
 
05:37:30.288 --> 05:37:30.298 align:start position:0%
so that's just I think that's probably
 
05:37:31.850 --> 05:37:31.860 align:start position:0%
the main source of it and that's just
 
05:37:34.970 --> 05:37:34.980 align:start position:0%
sometimes uh parents who neglect to pay
 
05:37:37.610 --> 05:37:37.620 align:start position:0%
and also another another advantage of
 
05:37:39.410 --> 05:37:39.420 align:start position:0%
doing uh unless this collection activity
 
05:37:41.690 --> 05:37:41.700 align:start position:0%
is it's fairly it's fairly expensive to
 
05:37:43.368 --> 05:37:43.378 align:start position:0%
collect all these small debts and there
 
05:37:44.810 --> 05:37:44.820 align:start position:0%
are um
 
05:37:47.030 --> 05:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
there are contractors that do it for the
 
05:37:49.250 --> 05:37:49.260 align:start position:0%
schools but um I think probably the you
 
05:37:50.030 --> 05:37:50.040 align:start position:0%
know we
 
05:37:52.310 --> 05:37:52.320 align:start position:0%
a lot of this a lot of the debt
 
05:37:54.110 --> 05:37:54.120 align:start position:0%
collection activities kind of kind of a
 
05:37:56.030 --> 05:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
waste of of effort and money in my
 
05:37:58.628 --> 05:37:58.638 align:start position:0%
opinion but that's um
 
05:38:01.490 --> 05:38:01.500 align:start position:0%
so that's that's kind of a long answer
 
05:38:03.050 --> 05:38:03.060 align:start position:0%
to your short question I don't know how
 
05:38:04.430 --> 05:38:04.440 align:start position:0%
much I don't know if that's if you're
 
05:38:09.830 --> 05:38:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:11.930 --> 05:38:11.940 align:start position:0%
put this accordingly uh thank you Mr
 
05:38:14.448 --> 05:38:14.458 align:start position:0%
chairman uh thank you representative
 
05:38:17.030 --> 05:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
um as you said we've had this bill a
 
05:38:18.708 --> 05:38:18.718 align:start position:0%
couple of times
 
05:38:20.868 --> 05:38:20.878 align:start position:0%
um and it seems to me
 
05:38:20.878 --> 05:38:21.830 align:start position:0%
um and it seems to me
um

05:38:21.830 --> 05:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:38:24.170 --> 05:38:24.180 align:start position:0%
my recollection might be faulty but
 
05:38:27.708 --> 05:38:27.718 align:start position:0%
perhaps you can tell me if um there are
 
05:38:31.430 --> 05:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
instances of a child being required to
 
05:38:34.190 --> 05:38:34.200 align:start position:0%
do chores in order to pay off a school
 
05:38:36.170 --> 05:38:36.180 align:start position:0%
that I I thought we had discussed this
 
05:38:39.650 --> 05:38:39.660 align:start position:0%
in the past and there that was not
 
05:38:42.050 --> 05:38:42.060 align:start position:0%
taking place well my I don't know
 
05:38:44.270 --> 05:38:44.280 align:start position:0%
there's few examples of even children
 
05:38:46.550 --> 05:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
here in the New Hampshire
 
05:38:49.128 --> 05:38:49.138 align:start position:0%
School District who do chores at school
 
05:38:52.070 --> 05:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
I know they're the closest thing I can
 
05:38:54.050 --> 05:38:54.060 align:start position:0%
the closest the closest thing I know
 
05:38:57.230 --> 05:38:57.240 align:start position:0%
specifically is we have uh there's a
 
05:38:59.030 --> 05:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
number of schools in my in my area
 
05:39:00.410 --> 05:39:00.420 align:start position:0%
including each one of my local
 
05:39:01.910 --> 05:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
Cooperative school districts which have
 
05:39:04.910 --> 05:39:04.920 align:start position:0%
a farm to table program so they have a
 
05:39:06.410 --> 05:39:06.420 align:start position:0%
you know they have like a garden which
 
05:39:09.650 --> 05:39:09.660 align:start position:0%
grows vegetables for use in the using
 
05:39:11.930 --> 05:39:11.940 align:start position:0%
the cafeteria and that's um
 
05:39:14.930 --> 05:39:14.940 align:start position:0%
although that's probably yeah so you
 
05:39:16.368 --> 05:39:16.378 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to force your kid to
 
05:39:18.650 --> 05:39:18.660 align:start position:0%
work on the farm to table Garden if you
 
05:39:20.208 --> 05:39:20.218 align:start position:0%
didn't want to just because he had a
 
05:39:22.128 --> 05:39:22.138 align:start position:0%
lunch debt so I think although I seem
 
05:39:24.530 --> 05:39:24.540 align:start position:0%
probably all the students who were doing
 
05:39:26.448 --> 05:39:26.458 align:start position:0%
that are doing so voluntarily or as part
 
05:39:27.890 --> 05:39:27.900 align:start position:0%
of an instructional program I mean
 
05:39:29.750 --> 05:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
there's some other something that may be
 
05:39:31.310 --> 05:39:31.320 align:start position:0%
copied to some of the charter schools I
 
05:39:32.990 --> 05:39:33.000 align:start position:0%
don't know which is true in other
 
05:39:34.970 --> 05:39:34.980 align:start position:0%
countries other countries uh
 
05:39:37.250 --> 05:39:37.260 align:start position:0%
do expect school children to do chores
 
05:39:39.350 --> 05:39:39.360 align:start position:0%
around the uh around the around the
 
05:39:41.690 --> 05:39:41.700 align:start position:0%
school I know even uh I just go for a
 
05:39:43.310 --> 05:39:43.320 align:start position:0%
year in England they would sometimes
 
05:39:45.830 --> 05:39:45.840 align:start position:0%
have us show a few things like painting
 
05:39:47.930 --> 05:39:47.940 align:start position:0%
the walls and the Courtyard at the
 
05:39:49.550 --> 05:39:49.560 align:start position:0%
school or something which is not not
 
05:39:50.690 --> 05:39:50.700 align:start position:0%
really the practice here in New
 
05:39:53.390 --> 05:39:53.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but there may be some uh maybe
 
05:39:54.948 --> 05:39:54.958 align:start position:0%
some Charter Schools or other special
 
05:39:56.690 --> 05:39:56.700 align:start position:0%
programs doing it you know the famous
 
05:39:58.610 --> 05:39:58.620 align:start position:0%
example of course is in Japan we're at
 
05:40:00.530 --> 05:40:00.540 align:start position:0%
the end of every school day they push
 
05:40:02.750 --> 05:40:02.760 align:start position:0%
all the desks and chairs to the wall and
 
05:40:04.250 --> 05:40:04.260 align:start position:0%
make the kids sweep the floor before
 
05:40:06.830 --> 05:40:06.840 align:start position:0%
they go which uh not something we do to
 
05:40:08.750 --> 05:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
the United States but there could be
 
05:40:10.250 --> 05:40:10.260 align:start position:0%
some Public Charter School here in New
 
05:40:11.570 --> 05:40:11.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire who thinks that's a good idea
 
05:40:13.490 --> 05:40:13.500 align:start position:0%
and has the children doing it but I
 
05:40:17.090 --> 05:40:17.100 align:start position:0%
don't know for sure yes I I think and
 
05:40:18.410 --> 05:40:18.420 align:start position:0%
maybe I missed it again but I think you
 
05:40:20.150 --> 05:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
said you don't know that that happens in
 
05:40:22.610 --> 05:40:22.620 align:start position:0%
HR school is that what I heard yes I
 
05:40:24.470 --> 05:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
don't know specifically you may uh okay
 
05:40:26.150 --> 05:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:40:28.970 --> 05:40:28.980 align:start position:0%
for the questions representative Belcher
 
05:40:31.730 --> 05:40:31.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
05:40:34.010 --> 05:40:34.020 align:start position:0%
I'm having a bit of confusion around
 
05:40:37.430 --> 05:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
lines 12 through 14.
 
05:40:38.930 --> 05:40:38.940 align:start position:0%
um any school participates in the
 
05:40:41.090 --> 05:40:41.100 align:start position:0%
National School breakfast program or the
 
05:40:42.590 --> 05:40:42.600 align:start position:0%
national school lunch program shall not
 
05:40:44.868 --> 05:40:44.878 align:start position:0%
provide to any child who qualifies for
 
05:40:47.330 --> 05:40:47.340 align:start position:0%
fruit use if breakfast or lunch an
 
05:40:48.708 --> 05:40:48.718 align:start position:0%
alternate meal that is not provided to
 
05:40:50.628 --> 05:40:50.638 align:start position:0%
the students generally yeah now I
 
05:40:51.890 --> 05:40:51.900 align:start position:0%
haven't spent a lot of time at various
 
05:40:53.990 --> 05:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
schools but I know when I went to school
 
05:40:55.368 --> 05:40:55.378 align:start position:0%
there was there was tended to be
 
05:40:58.310 --> 05:40:58.320 align:start position:0%
multiple different options available so
 
05:40:58.320 --> 05:40:59.208 align:start position:0%
multiple different options available so
what

05:40:59.208 --> 05:40:59.218 align:start position:0%
what
 
05:41:00.948 --> 05:41:00.958 align:start position:0%
can you clarify if this for instance
 
05:41:03.170 --> 05:41:03.180 align:start position:0%
including vendors some schools bring in
 
05:41:06.170 --> 05:41:06.180 align:start position:0%
vendors and whatnot would this require a
 
05:41:08.930 --> 05:41:08.940 align:start position:0%
school to allow a child to have a choice
 
05:41:11.090 --> 05:41:11.100 align:start position:0%
of anything including vendors that may
 
05:41:14.390 --> 05:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
be higher priced or something like that
 
05:41:17.030 --> 05:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
um I don't think so I think what the uh
 
05:41:18.948 --> 05:41:18.958 align:start position:0%
the example that I've heard about this
 
05:41:20.510 --> 05:41:20.520 align:start position:0%
has happened in certainly many other
 
05:41:23.030 --> 05:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
states which is uh you know let the kid
 
05:41:24.890 --> 05:41:24.900 align:start position:0%
have the hot lunch but they give them
 
05:41:28.128 --> 05:41:28.138 align:start position:0%
something like uh well sunflower butter
 
05:41:30.230 --> 05:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
give him her sunflower butter sandwich
 
05:41:32.090 --> 05:41:32.100 align:start position:0%
or a cheese sandwich or something that's
 
05:41:34.190 --> 05:41:34.200 align:start position:0%
not available to the other children it
 
05:41:37.190 --> 05:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
certainly doesn't um doesn't forbid uh
 
05:41:39.650 --> 05:41:39.660 align:start position:0%
doesn't prevent the school lunch program
 
05:41:41.510 --> 05:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
or practice from offering the children
 
05:41:44.090 --> 05:41:44.100 align:start position:0%
the choice of entrees and certainly um
 
05:41:47.510 --> 05:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
it doesn't provide anyone regardless of
 
05:41:49.430 --> 05:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
their family's financial situation from
 
05:41:51.470 --> 05:41:51.480 align:start position:0%
bringing in their own home lunch if they
 
05:41:53.030 --> 05:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
prefer so those are still allowable
 
05:41:54.948 --> 05:41:54.958 align:start position:0%
practices and
 
05:41:57.190 --> 05:41:57.200 align:start position:0%
um so I'm not sure
 
05:41:59.448 --> 05:41:59.458 align:start position:0%
not not sure what not sure if that
 
05:42:01.128 --> 05:42:01.138 align:start position:0%
answers you not sure if that's I'm not
 
05:42:02.510 --> 05:42:02.520 align:start position:0%
sure what more there is to say about it
 
05:42:04.310 --> 05:42:04.320 align:start position:0%
but yet that doesn't you can still
 
05:42:06.530 --> 05:42:06.540 align:start position:0%
provide multiple meals to the kids they
 
05:42:09.470 --> 05:42:09.480 align:start position:0%
don't all have to eat the same thing if
 
05:42:13.128 --> 05:42:13.138 align:start position:0%
are there other other questions yes just
 
05:42:14.990 --> 05:42:15.000 align:start position:0%
to clarify a little bit what I what I
 
05:42:16.850 --> 05:42:16.860 align:start position:0%
meant was when I went to school anyway
 
05:42:18.830 --> 05:42:18.840 align:start position:0%
we had vendors come in for instance we
 
05:42:20.930 --> 05:42:20.940 align:start position:0%
had Domino's Pizza and you could just go
 
05:42:22.850 --> 05:42:22.860 align:start position:0%
in and purchase Domino's Pizza as part
 
05:42:25.670 --> 05:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
of your lunch with this the way this is
 
05:42:27.830 --> 05:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
written here would this require schools
 
05:42:31.490 --> 05:42:31.500 align:start position:0%
to then cover the cost of students who
 
05:42:34.910 --> 05:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to get from those vendors instead
 
05:42:37.010 --> 05:42:37.020 align:start position:0%
of from the school cafeteria I would
 
05:42:39.948 --> 05:42:39.958 align:start position:0%
I would I would uh
 
05:42:41.750 --> 05:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
I would assume that it would not require
 
05:42:44.090 --> 05:42:44.100 align:start position:0%
them to cover the cost of any outside
 
05:42:46.670 --> 05:42:46.680 align:start position:0%
vendors or selling food that uh
 
05:42:49.070 --> 05:42:49.080 align:start position:0%
isn't but that the schools aren't paying
 
05:42:50.208 --> 05:42:50.218 align:start position:0%
for now and of course they're going to
 
05:42:52.010 --> 05:42:52.020 align:start position:0%
be a lot more expensive to pay Domino's
 
05:42:53.930 --> 05:42:53.940 align:start position:0%
for the lunch than the school lunch
 
05:42:55.430 --> 05:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
program but
 
05:42:59.390 --> 05:42:59.400 align:start position:0%
um I'm frankly I'm I'm like I was born
 
05:43:02.570 --> 05:43:02.580 align:start position:0%
in 1956 so this was not going on when I
 
05:43:04.310 --> 05:43:04.320 align:start position:0%
was in the public school in the mid 70s
 
05:43:07.368 --> 05:43:07.378 align:start position:0%
so I that's a
 
05:43:09.530 --> 05:43:09.540 align:start position:0%
I mean if you think there's an issue you
 
05:43:11.090 --> 05:43:11.100 align:start position:0%
might want to look into that but I I
 
05:43:12.590 --> 05:43:12.600 align:start position:0%
don't know if I don't think that would
 
05:43:14.810 --> 05:43:14.820 align:start position:0%
forbid that practice
 
05:43:16.430 --> 05:43:16.440 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
05:43:16.440 --> 05:43:18.128 align:start position:0%
further questions
yes

05:43:18.128 --> 05:43:18.138 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:43:20.150 --> 05:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:43:22.610 --> 05:43:22.620 align:start position:0%
representative Horgan lens four and five
 
05:43:25.070 --> 05:43:25.080 align:start position:0%
say prohibit public identification or
 
05:43:27.110 --> 05:43:27.120 align:start position:0%
stigmatization of a student who cannot
 
05:43:30.170 --> 05:43:30.180 align:start position:0%
pay for a meal is this to prevent
 
05:43:32.330 --> 05:43:32.340 align:start position:0%
discrimination against students of a
 
05:43:35.030 --> 05:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
certain socioeconomic status
 
05:43:36.650 --> 05:43:36.660 align:start position:0%
um well that would uh
 
05:43:38.448 --> 05:43:38.458 align:start position:0%
would be highly correlated with
 
05:43:40.550 --> 05:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
socioeconomic status I mean may also
 
05:43:44.570 --> 05:43:44.580 align:start position:0%
just have kids who's a parents have are
 
05:43:46.190 --> 05:43:46.200 align:start position:0%
leading disorganized life even though
 
05:43:48.470 --> 05:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
they may be making it making a good
 
05:43:50.570 --> 05:43:50.580 align:start position:0%
income but that would be or just like
 
05:43:53.990 --> 05:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
not only questions like to associate the
 
05:43:55.128 --> 05:43:55.138 align:start position:0%
idea is that you're only supposed to
 
05:43:57.708 --> 05:43:57.718 align:start position:0%
tell uh you're only supposed to tell the
 
05:43:59.810 --> 05:43:59.820 align:start position:0%
you know the parents the administrator
 
05:44:02.030 --> 05:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
keeping a need to know policy so not
 
05:44:03.830 --> 05:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
informing you know the general School
 
05:44:05.690 --> 05:44:05.700 align:start position:0%
population or the public outside the
 
05:44:07.670 --> 05:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
school of which kids it is who are
 
05:44:10.128 --> 05:44:10.138 align:start position:0%
paying the luncheon escorts highly
 
05:44:11.628 --> 05:44:11.638 align:start position:0%
correlated with your social economic
 
05:44:13.310 --> 05:44:13.320 align:start position:0%
status but there may be
 
05:44:15.410 --> 05:44:15.420 align:start position:0%
maybe people like some papers of mine
 
05:44:15.420 --> 05:44:16.368 align:start position:0%
maybe people like some papers of mine
who

05:44:16.368 --> 05:44:16.378 align:start position:0%
who
 
05:44:18.288 --> 05:44:18.298 align:start position:0%
their father was kind of disorganized
 
05:44:19.190 --> 05:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
and they're always getting the
 
05:44:20.868 --> 05:44:20.878 align:start position:0%
electricity cut off and that sort of
 
05:44:22.430 --> 05:44:22.440 align:start position:0%
thing but he was actually making a very
 
05:44:24.110 --> 05:44:24.120 align:start position:0%
good salary he was just sort of a
 
05:44:26.510 --> 05:44:26.520 align:start position:0%
disorganized person but most cases
 
05:44:28.490 --> 05:44:28.500 align:start position:0%
that'd be social economic status would
 
05:44:30.230 --> 05:44:30.240 align:start position:0%
probably be highly correlated with it
 
05:44:32.570 --> 05:44:32.580 align:start position:0%
but thanks looks like it will follow up
 
05:44:34.910 --> 05:44:34.920 align:start position:0%
so go ahead yeah
 
05:44:37.070 --> 05:44:37.080 align:start position:0%
so but the intent is to prevent
 
05:44:38.750 --> 05:44:38.760 align:start position:0%
discrimination against certain students
 
05:44:41.448 --> 05:44:41.458 align:start position:0%
yes yes as kids aren't the kids whose
 
05:44:42.770 --> 05:44:42.780 align:start position:0%
parents aren't paying the lunch debt
 
05:44:44.868 --> 05:44:44.878 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't be uh harassed or
 
05:44:47.208 --> 05:44:47.218 align:start position:0%
stigmatized by their peers or even by
 
05:44:49.548 --> 05:44:49.558 align:start position:0%
their teachers no
 
05:44:51.288 --> 05:44:51.298 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question yes for
 
05:44:53.150 --> 05:44:53.160 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald thank you Mr
 
05:44:55.548 --> 05:44:55.558 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for being here I
 
05:44:57.590 --> 05:44:57.600 align:start position:0%
noticed that the bill doesn't
 
05:44:59.930 --> 05:44:59.940 align:start position:0%
designate how this should be enforced if
 
05:45:02.270 --> 05:45:02.280 align:start position:0%
a parent or a child even reports that
 
05:45:03.650 --> 05:45:03.660 align:start position:0%
they've been stigmatized or that their
 
05:45:05.448 --> 05:45:05.458 align:start position:0%
child's been stigmatized so how do you
 
05:45:07.310 --> 05:45:07.320 align:start position:0%
envision that this is really enforced at
 
05:45:08.868 --> 05:45:08.878 align:start position:0%
the local level or even at the state
 
05:45:08.878 --> 05:45:11.448 align:start position:0%
the local level or even at the state
level

05:45:11.448 --> 05:45:11.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:13.788 --> 05:45:13.798 align:start position:0%
well if they're uh I mean I guess the
 
05:45:16.010 --> 05:45:16.020 align:start position:0%
parents could that the policy was
 
05:45:18.650 --> 05:45:18.660 align:start position:0%
violated uh you would want them to just
 
05:45:20.330 --> 05:45:20.340 align:start position:0%
take corrective action and stop fighting
 
05:45:22.070 --> 05:45:22.080 align:start position:0%
the process they could lead to lawsuits
 
05:45:24.288 --> 05:45:24.298 align:start position:0%
an extreme thing and if and if a parent
 
05:45:25.250 --> 05:45:25.260 align:start position:0%
runs up
 
05:45:27.350 --> 05:45:27.360 align:start position:0%
an excessive lunch debt you know they
 
05:45:29.868 --> 05:45:29.878 align:start position:0%
can uh you know they can the school can
 
05:45:31.850 --> 05:45:31.860 align:start position:0%
collect on the debt I suppose they could
 
05:45:35.150 --> 05:45:35.160 align:start position:0%
even uh even sue them in extreme cases I
 
05:45:37.070 --> 05:45:37.080 align:start position:0%
think most most of the time this is
 
05:45:38.868 --> 05:45:38.878 align:start position:0%
relatively small number of dollars so
 
05:45:42.048 --> 05:45:42.058 align:start position:0%
like it's uh probably uh it can probably
 
05:45:44.570 --> 05:45:44.580 align:start position:0%
be a the upper the cost can probably be
 
05:45:47.628 --> 05:45:47.638 align:start position:0%
be absorbed but uh and also there have
 
05:45:50.570 --> 05:45:50.580 align:start position:0%
been some cases where uh benefactors
 
05:45:52.490 --> 05:45:52.500 align:start position:0%
even here in New Hampshire benefactors
 
05:45:54.490 --> 05:45:54.500 align:start position:0%
you know outside
 
05:45:57.288 --> 05:45:57.298 align:start position:0%
what's outside benefactors uh some
 
05:45:58.788 --> 05:45:58.798 align:start position:0%
generous local person will occasionally
 
05:46:00.470 --> 05:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
just uh
 
05:46:02.570 --> 05:46:02.580 align:start position:0%
give the school money to pay off all the
 
05:46:05.628 --> 05:46:05.638 align:start position:0%
outstanding lunch debts so that's um
 
05:46:07.850 --> 05:46:07.860 align:start position:0%
are there further questions
 
05:46:09.530 --> 05:46:09.540 align:start position:0%
not seeing any hands thank you very much
 
05:46:11.510 --> 05:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you and there are no
 
05:46:13.430 --> 05:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
other pink cards we have on so we will
 
05:46:14.810 --> 05:46:14.820 align:start position:0%
close this hearing
 
05:46:17.030 --> 05:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
and this concludes the hearings for
 
05:46:17.040 --> 05:46:18.048 align:start position:0%
and this concludes the hearings for
today

05:46:18.048 --> 05:46:18.058 align:start position:0%
today
 
05:46:22.070 --> 05:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chair can I see the them's out in
 
05:46:23.990 --> 05:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
the hallway please tell me I need to see
 
05:46:26.750 --> 05:46:26.760 align:start position:0%
the demons out in the hallway oh okay
 
05:46:28.970 --> 05:46:28.980 align:start position:0%
okay thank you yeah
 
05:46:28.980 --> 05:46:29.750 align:start position:0%
okay thank you yeah
um

05:46:29.750 --> 05:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:46:32.030 --> 05:46:32.040 align:start position:0%
one thing I wanted to mention to all the
 
05:46:34.910 --> 05:46:34.920 align:start position:0%
committee members here is that when we
 
05:46:38.830 --> 05:46:38.840 align:start position:0%
hear bills now we can exec a bill
 
05:46:41.810 --> 05:46:41.820 align:start position:0%
following the hearing even though it may
 
05:46:44.270 --> 05:46:44.280 align:start position:0%
not be listed as such executive session
 
05:46:47.570 --> 05:46:47.580 align:start position:0%
may follow if in fact that both
 
05:46:50.628 --> 05:46:50.638 align:start position:0%
representative Miler and I agree that we
 
05:46:53.208 --> 05:46:53.218 align:start position:0%
want to move forward with that bill so
 
05:46:55.190 --> 05:46:55.200 align:start position:0%
we can get unanimous consent and move
 
05:46:57.530 --> 05:46:57.540 align:start position:0%
forward and get that done it's a quick
 
05:46:59.030 --> 05:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
way to get some bills on the consent
 
05:47:01.670 --> 05:47:01.680 align:start position:0%
calendar we're going to run into a real
 
05:47:05.330 --> 05:47:05.340 align:start position:0%
heavy roadblock here with 91 bills
 
05:47:07.368 --> 05:47:07.378 align:start position:0%
piling up on us if we can unload some of
 
05:47:10.070 --> 05:47:10.080 align:start position:0%
these into upcoming sessions it would be
 
05:47:12.708 --> 05:47:12.718 align:start position:0%
really helpful so
 
05:47:15.288 --> 05:47:15.298 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and the Democrats
 
05:47:17.868 --> 05:47:17.878 align:start position:0%
want to meet out in the hallway I guess
 
05:47:19.670 --> 05:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
there's well probably a room across the
 
05:47:21.708 --> 05:47:21.718 align:start position:0%
hall too you could use
 
05:47:21.718 --> 05:47:23.930 align:start position:0%
hall too you could use
um

05:47:23.930 --> 05:47:23.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:28.490 --> 05:47:28.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:30.650 --> 05:47:30.660 align:start position:0%
