that you all came out in the snow um and

that you all came out in the snow um and
I<00:18:50.600><c> I</c><00:18:50.720><c> guess</c><00:18:50.960><c> I</c><00:18:51.039><c> will</c><00:18:51.400><c> say</c><00:18:51.679><c> one</c><00:18:51.919><c> other</c><00:18:52.240><c> thing</c>

00:18:52.510 --> 00:18:52.520 align:start position:0%
I I guess I will say one other thing
 

00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:53.990 align:start position:0%
I I guess I will say one other thing
although<00:18:52.840><c> we're</c><00:18:52.960><c> in</c><00:18:53.039><c> the</c><00:18:53.159><c> voting</c><00:18:53.440><c> mode</c><00:18:53.799><c> I</c>

00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
although we're in the voting mode I
 

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.630 align:start position:0%
although we're in the voting mode I
probably<00:18:54.360><c> should</c><00:18:54.600><c> have</c><00:18:54.880><c> t</c><00:18:55.360><c> asked</c><00:18:55.720><c> for</c><00:18:56.000><c> any</c>

00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
probably should have t asked for any
 

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:59.270 align:start position:0%
probably should have t asked for any
anything<00:18:57.039><c> at</c><00:18:57.200><c> that</c><00:18:57.440><c> point</c>

00:18:59.270 --> 00:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
anything at that point
 

00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:01.870 align:start position:0%
anything at that point
so<00:18:59.600><c> normally</c><00:19:00.200><c> it's</c><00:19:00.400><c> not</c><00:19:00.559><c> a</c><00:19:00.720><c> matter</c><00:19:00.960><c> of</c><00:19:01.159><c> taking</c>

00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:01.880 align:start position:0%
so normally it's not a matter of taking
 

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:04.310 align:start position:0%
so normally it's not a matter of taking
testimony<00:19:02.880><c> or</c><00:19:03.159><c> hearing</c><00:19:03.559><c> from</c><00:19:03.799><c> people</c><00:19:04.039><c> in</c><00:19:04.159><c> a</c>

and let it go I do think there's things
 

00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:52.630 align:start position:0%
and let it go I do think there's things
that<00:30:49.679><c> could</c><00:30:49.880><c> be</c><00:30:50.039><c> done</c><00:30:50.480><c> on</c><00:30:50.640><c> the</c><00:30:50.799><c> fiscal</c><00:30:51.279><c> side</c><00:30:51.960><c> to</c>

that could be done on the fiscal side to

that could be done on the fiscal side to

00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
support um maybe an alternative because
 

00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:58.830 align:start position:0%
support um maybe an alternative because
this<00:30:55.880><c> is</c><00:30:56.039><c> a</c><00:30:56.320><c> little</c><00:30:56.720><c> narrow</c><00:30:57.360><c> window</c><00:30:57.720><c> of</c><00:30:58.080><c> time</c>
