same thing okay maybe it's for the

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:46.160 align:start position:0%
welcome to the subcommittee meeting on
 
00:09:50.949 --> 00:09:50.959 align:start position:0%
House Bill um 637 I believe correct I
 
00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
don't have the notice in front of me uh
 
00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
thank you um the subcommittee will only
 
00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
be looking at this bill as this is the
 
00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:00.120 align:start position:0%
only one that has been noticed um
 
00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:02.600 align:start position:0%
essentially this bill has was presented
 
00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
to us as a way to make whole the
 
00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
employees who were not who who were
 
00:10:13.269 --> 00:10:13.279 align:start position:0%
unintentionally not included in um
 
00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:16.040 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 57 which was then
 
00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
incorporated into the budget in uh
 
00:10:24.269 --> 00:10:24.279 align:start position:0%
2023 we had our researcher Brad gedin
 
00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
look and he has a nice comparison for us
 
00:10:29.509 --> 00:10:29.519 align:start position:0%
on what the actual changes were in those
 
00:10:32.949 --> 00:10:32.959 align:start position:0%
statutes made by House Bill 2 um and I
 
00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:36.160 align:start position:0%
did further research looking at the full
 
00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:38.920 align:start position:0%
Senate report and Senate hearing report
 
00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
that followed the all of Senate Bill 57
 
00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
through its process um I did reduce that
 
00:10:48.269 --> 00:10:48.279 align:start position:0%
document from the 74 Pages down to about
 
00:10:50.949 --> 00:10:50.959 align:start position:0%
34 or so just so that I wasn't print
 
00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
killing extra trees while trying to get
 
00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:54.240 align:start position:0%
the information that I thought might be
 
00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:56.320 align:start position:0%
relevant to us I can send that all out
 
00:10:58.030 --> 00:10:58.040 align:start position:0%
to the committee and it's all available
 
00:11:00.829 --> 00:11:00.839 align:start position:0%
if you look up Senate bill 57 from
 
00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
2023 you go into the bill history and
 
00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:05.480 align:start position:0%
then um there's a part where you can
 
00:11:06.949 --> 00:11:06.959 align:start position:0%
click on the Senate
 
00:11:09.629 --> 00:11:09.639 align:start position:0%
documents the reason I'm looking into
 
00:11:11.269 --> 00:11:11.279 align:start position:0%
this information and why I think it's
 
00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:13.680 align:start position:0%
relevant is that we were told that this
 
00:11:15.509 --> 00:11:15.519 align:start position:0%
bill was brought to us because it was an
 
00:11:18.949 --> 00:11:18.959 align:start position:0%
oversight that was not caught um to not
 
00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:21.320 align:start position:0%
include the employees who had already
 
00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:24.560 align:start position:0%
retired pre prior to enactment of the
 
00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
2023 as it stands I have the bill as
 
00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:32.200 align:start position:0%
introduced that has a fiscal note for
 
00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
the entire kitten Kaboodle um including
 
00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:37.480 align:start position:0%
everybody who had the had the change in
 
00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:39.800 align:start position:0%
their benefits because of the the budget
 
00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:40.750 align:start position:0%
their benefits because of the the budget
in

00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:40.760 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
2023 um and that was pretty
 
00:11:48.389 --> 00:11:48.399 align:start position:0%
significant that was $1.4 Million to the
 
00:11:51.829 --> 00:11:51.839 align:start position:0%
state this year and $ 5.74 million to
 
00:11:51.839 --> 00:11:52.509 align:start position:0%
state this year and $ 5.74 million to
the

00:11:52.509 --> 00:11:52.519 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:54.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities and because those are
 
00:11:57.389 --> 00:11:57.399 align:start position:0%
calculated every two years that we're
 
00:11:58.750 --> 00:11:58.760 align:start position:0%
all going to be paying that difference
 
00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:00.680 align:start position:0%
in our proper property tax this year
 
00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:03.720 align:start position:0%
because that increase of the $5.7
 
00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
million was not included until um this
 
00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:11.240 align:start position:0%
new B bium with our tax rates so that's
 
00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
being paid by um by the employers which
 
00:12:15.509 --> 00:12:15.519 align:start position:0%
are the residents of our towns and
 
00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:18.440 align:start position:0%
school districts um additionally looking
 
00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:20.600 align:start position:0%
at the fiscal note that is in here from
 
00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
the prev from the bill that started this
 
00:12:26.389 --> 00:12:26.399 align:start position:0%
whole thing um that the New Hampshire
 
00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:28.600 align:start position:0%
retirement system actuary projected an
 
00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
increase in Actuarial accured liability
 
00:12:34.069 --> 00:12:34.079 align:start position:0%
by $45 million based on the provision of
 
00:12:36.069 --> 00:12:36.079 align:start position:0%
the bill which would be amortised over a
 
00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
fixed period of no longer than 20 years
 
00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:41.720 align:start position:0%
so this is a significant financial
 
00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:44.399 align:start position:0%
outlay and that is I believe a large
 
00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:46.760 align:start position:0%
part of why the Senate put that into the
 
00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:50.240 align:start position:0%
budget in 2023 as opposed to having a
 
00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:52.680 align:start position:0%
very expensive Bill run along separately
 
00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:54.440 align:start position:0%
without being part of the budget process
 
00:12:55.829 --> 00:12:55.839 align:start position:0%
because quite frankly you don't want to
 
00:12:58.030 --> 00:12:58.040 align:start position:0%
spend that amount of money without doing
 
00:13:01.189 --> 00:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
that appropriately in the budget so I
 
00:13:04.949 --> 00:13:04.959 align:start position:0%
look to the history of this bill so we
 
00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:06.680 align:start position:0%
in our little packets that we have from
 
00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
the Senate hearing as you flip through
 
00:13:10.509 --> 00:13:10.519 align:start position:0%
you get to a part that has the committee
 
00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:12.320 align:start position:0%
me minutes and it has the calendar
 
00:13:15.629 --> 00:13:15.639 align:start position:0%
notice from the January 18th hearing
 
00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:17.000 align:start position:0%
they actually give a really great
 
00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:18.760 align:start position:0%
rundown from the senate about what
 
00:13:21.389 --> 00:13:21.399 align:start position:0%
happens um and notes and minutes from it
 
00:13:22.829 --> 00:13:22.839 align:start position:0%
that is really helpful when you're
 
00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:24.320 align:start position:0%
looking at the bills for those of you
 
00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
who are newer to the legislature so
 
00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:29.360 align:start position:0%
there was the the the Pres people who
 
00:13:32.269 --> 00:13:32.279 align:start position:0%
presented um Senator the senator
 
00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
introduced it and then Brian Hawkins
 
00:13:37.949 --> 00:13:37.959 align:start position:0%
from the Nea supported the bill and then
 
00:13:40.189 --> 00:13:40.199 align:start position:0%
um the testim neutral information
 
00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
presented by Marty carlan of the New
 
00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:44.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire retirement system actually
 
00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:47.000 align:start position:0%
highlighted at that point that the bill
 
00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
would be considered prospective which
 
00:13:51.189 --> 00:13:51.199 align:start position:0%
means that anyone who retired before the
 
00:13:53.749 --> 00:13:53.759 align:start position:0%
effective date would not be affected and
 
00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
this bill only affects those that
 
00:13:58.030 --> 00:13:58.040 align:start position:0%
retired on or after that
 
00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:00.440 align:start position:0%
date so that's sort of where I get to a
 
00:14:02.829 --> 00:14:02.839 align:start position:0%
disconnect on what we were told when the
 
00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
bill was introduced um that this had
 
00:14:07.069 --> 00:14:07.079 align:start position:0%
been an oversight because the this
 
00:14:09.189 --> 00:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
language the current language pass
 
00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:10.720 align:start position:0%
Senate executive departments and
 
00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:14.320 align:start position:0%
administration committee um on consent
 
00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:16.360 align:start position:0%
with the initially introduced language
 
00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
which was prospective and had no
 
00:14:21.269 --> 00:14:21.279 align:start position:0%
retroactive sections then it passed
 
00:14:23.389 --> 00:14:23.399 align:start position:0%
Senate finance and then was tabled on
 
00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:25.480 align:start position:0%
the floor so it could be included in the
 
00:14:28.189 --> 00:14:28.199 align:start position:0%
budget it was known at that point as
 
00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:31.320 align:start position:0%
well that this was prospective language
 
00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:33.240 align:start position:0%
um expensive prospective language but
 
00:14:35.189 --> 00:14:35.199 align:start position:0%
prospective language and then it was
 
00:14:37.749 --> 00:14:37.759 align:start position:0%
added into the budget also knowing that
 
00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:40.680 align:start position:0%
it was prospective legislation that was
 
00:14:43.069 --> 00:14:43.079 align:start position:0%
going to unfortunately leave a portion
 
00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:45.560 align:start position:0%
of our retirees be
 
00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:48.160 align:start position:0%
behind this was a policy decision by the
 
00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:50.120 align:start position:0%
senate in a year when we had far more
 
00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
money than we have this year and this is
 
00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:56.040 align:start position:0%
something that perhaps they may be
 
00:14:59.430 --> 00:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
looking to bring again in the budget but
 
00:15:01.749 --> 00:15:01.759 align:start position:0%
this is this th
 
00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
this that was a policy decision um it
 
00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
was not an oversight and looking at that
 
00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
looking at this information um I think
 
00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:11.240 align:start position:0%
that that's really important to know I
 
00:15:12.389 --> 00:15:12.399 align:start position:0%
don't know if there's anybody who wants
 
00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:18.670 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:18.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:23.189 --> 00:15:23.199 align:start position:0%
no um so I do want to say that I wish I
 
00:15:24.949 --> 00:15:24.959 align:start position:0%
wish we all had all the money in the
 
00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:26.320 align:start position:0%
budget to be able to give everybody
 
00:15:28.069 --> 00:15:28.079 align:start position:0%
everything that they deserve because the
 
00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:29.880 align:start position:0%
people who work for our State the people
 
00:15:31.629 --> 00:15:31.639 align:start position:0%
who work for our schools do an
 
00:15:34.509 --> 00:15:34.519 align:start position:0%
incredibly important job um right now we
 
00:15:37.309 --> 00:15:37.319 align:start position:0%
are looking at addressing the issues for
 
00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:39.480 align:start position:0%
the group two employees who were hired
 
00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
on with one set of terms for their
 
00:15:44.309 --> 00:15:44.319 align:start position:0%
pensions and then that was changed in 20
 
00:15:47.629 --> 00:15:47.639 align:start position:0%
um 2011 2012 time period so there's a
 
00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
very expensive very important bill that
 
00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:52.240 align:start position:0%
is moving forward and likely will be in
 
00:15:55.309 --> 00:15:55.319 align:start position:0%
the state budget um this is also very
 
00:15:57.710 --> 00:15:57.720 align:start position:0%
very important however when these
 
00:15:59.509 --> 00:15:59.519 align:start position:0%
employees took their re enironment they
 
00:16:01.629 --> 00:16:01.639 align:start position:0%
knew the terms that they had and it was
 
00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:04.120 align:start position:0%
stated in public testimony that it was
 
00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
not part of the bill at that time um as
 
00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:08.160 align:start position:0%
much as I would like to be able to give
 
00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
this I am also looking at all of our
 
00:16:12.389 --> 00:16:12.399 align:start position:0%
taxpayers throughout um and with that I
 
00:16:14.749 --> 00:16:14.759 align:start position:0%
think that it would make sense for us to
 
00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:16.440 align:start position:0%
unfortunately recommend this is an
 
00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate because because
 
00:16:22.309 --> 00:16:22.319 align:start position:0%
because we have to look at every penny
 
00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:24.240 align:start position:0%
that we have and this was not an
 
00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
oversight on the part of the Senate it
 
00:16:28.509 --> 00:16:28.519 align:start position:0%
was a policy decision so um I'm going to
 
00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:29.560 align:start position:0%
move I
 
00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:38.720 align:start position:0%
discussion yes representative Howard
 
00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
thank you so I I'm uh in opposition to
 
00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
the itl motion because I believe that
 
00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
when we are creating contracts with
 
00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:49.800 align:start position:0%
individuals uh No Matter What entity we
 
00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
need to make sure that we're following
 
00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
through on these contracts and the thing
 
00:16:55.749 --> 00:16:55.759 align:start position:0%
is is that as is uh we have a retirement
 
00:16:59.629 --> 00:16:59.639 align:start position:0%
age that uh is different than what
 
00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:02.600 align:start position:0%
Social Security can provide and the
 
00:17:04.789 --> 00:17:04.799 align:start position:0%
thing is is that we should clearly make
 
00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
those the same it is forcing people uh
 
00:17:11.309 --> 00:17:11.319 align:start position:0%
to work an extra two years unnecessarily
 
00:17:12.429 --> 00:17:12.439 align:start position:0%
uh when they could request the
 
00:17:16.350 --> 00:17:16.360 align:start position:0%
retirement uh at 65 instead of 67 so
 
00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:19.000 align:start position:0%
with that I I can't say that I can
 
00:17:21.309 --> 00:17:21.319 align:start position:0%
support the itl motion and I will be uh
 
00:17:24.669 --> 00:17:24.679 align:start position:0%
looking for an OTP thank you thank you
 
00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:26.520 align:start position:0%
there are other comments uh
 
00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
representative SLA Loi how do I say it
 
00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:32.200 align:start position:0%
again sloty thank you I get nervous when
 
00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:34.400 align:start position:0%
I say people's names SL
 
00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
okay uh I I you mentioned uh the
 
00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
previous speaker mentioned um uh
 
00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:42.480 align:start position:0%
obligations contractual obligations I
 
00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:44.320 align:start position:0%
I'm curious is there any specific
 
00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
contractual obligation that you're aware
 
00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
of that that you spoke to or is it uh
 
00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:51.510 align:start position:0%
of that that you spoke to or is it uh
some

00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:51.520 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:54.640 align:start position:0%
other uh you know is there something
 
00:17:57.470 --> 00:17:57.480 align:start position:0%
else that I'm unaware of
 
00:17:59.230 --> 00:17:59.240 align:start position:0%
potentially when we're talking about
 
00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:02.320 align:start position:0%
retirement contracts it's looking I mean
 
00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:04.120 align:start position:0%
there are different plans for people and
 
00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:05.480 align:start position:0%
it depends on what those individuals
 
00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:07.720 align:start position:0%
choose but members of the New Hampshire
 
00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:10.840 align:start position:0%
retirement system uh are basically
 
00:18:13.029 --> 00:18:13.039 align:start position:0%
promised things from the state of New
 
00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:17.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh I uh you know I'm
 
00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
I'm I still think that it's something
 
00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
where we do need to provide uh These
 
00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:25.480 align:start position:0%
funds to people and make sure that we
 
00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:28.360 align:start position:0%
can provide retirement at these uh lower
 
00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:29.549 align:start position:0%
can provide retirement at these uh lower
ages

00:18:29.549 --> 00:18:29.559 align:start position:0%
ages
 
00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:32.600 align:start position:0%
but you know again
 
00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:37.400 align:start position:0%
opinions thank you thank you and um yes
 
00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
questions um so uh this this is a
 
00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:43.080 align:start position:0%
subcommittee work session it's not a
 
00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:45.440 align:start position:0%
hearing um so I wanted have our
 
00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
discussion here as well I appreciate
 
00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:50.440 align:start position:0%
that you all came out in the snow um and
 
00:18:52.510 --> 00:18:52.520 align:start position:0%
I I guess I will say one other thing
 
00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
although we're in the voting mode I
 
00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
probably should have t asked for any
 
00:18:59.270 --> 00:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
anything at that point
 
00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:01.880 align:start position:0%
so normally it's not a matter of taking
 
00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
testimony or hearing from people in a
 
00:19:07.909 --> 00:19:07.919 align:start position:0%
subcommittee work session but given that
 
00:19:11.149 --> 00:19:11.159 align:start position:0%
you guys drove out in the snow um do you
 
00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:12.600 align:start position:0%
mind if I just give each of you maybe
 
00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:14.200 align:start position:0%
two or three minutes each just because
 
00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:18.360 align:start position:0%
you did make the drive in the snow um I
 
00:19:20.909 --> 00:19:20.919 align:start position:0%
will I know it's not exactly correct
 
00:19:22.549 --> 00:19:22.559 align:start position:0%
procedure I guess I'll I'll withdraw my
 
00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
motion and then we'll make it again so
 
00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
we've withdrawn the motion and withdrawn
 
00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:28.520 align:start position:0%
the second so that since you've you've
 
00:19:30.669 --> 00:19:30.679 align:start position:0%
uh made the trip in the snow we can hear
 
00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:32.200 align:start position:0%
from each of you if you'd like to we'll
 
00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
need to have a pink card from you but
 
00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
I'll give you two or three
 
00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:38.480 align:start position:0%
minutes thanks up up to the microphone
 
00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:42.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:45.440 align:start position:0%
streamed so the record can you wait till
 
00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:48.400 align:start position:0%
you put the microphone on oh yeah yes
 
00:19:51.549 --> 00:19:51.559 align:start position:0%
for the record Bob blell uh representing
 
00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:53.080 align:start position:0%
the state employees
 
00:19:55.710 --> 00:19:55.720 align:start position:0%
Association um I I guess I'm a bit
 
00:20:00.549 --> 00:20:00.559 align:start position:0%
confused because this is my 28th session
 
00:20:02.029 --> 00:20:02.039 align:start position:0%
and I've been to a lot of
 
00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:04.640 align:start position:0%
subcommittees um which involves the
 
00:20:07.029 --> 00:20:07.039 align:start position:0%
public so I'm a little bit confused
 
00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
because yes it's a work session however
 
00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:10.480 align:start position:0%
it's a work session for not only
 
00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:12.320 align:start position:0%
legislators but also from the public and
 
00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
I understand the whole testimony
 
00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
situation but it's been my
 
00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:18.720 align:start position:0%
experience that um there's a
 
00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:20.720 align:start position:0%
conversation during these I've had many
 
00:20:22.149 --> 00:20:22.159 align:start position:0%
conversations and work sessions in this
 
00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
room for Edna for decades so am I to
 
00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:27.960 align:start position:0%
understand that um before you take the
 
00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:30.640 align:start position:0%
vote you're not going to include us just
 
00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:33.320 align:start position:0%
a procedural thing is something changed
 
00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:35.360 align:start position:0%
um actually the procedures are always
 
00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
that uh the hearings are open for
 
00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:39.320 align:start position:0%
everybody who wants to testify
 
00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:41.480 align:start position:0%
subcommittees that is to the discretion
 
00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:43.280 align:start position:0%
of the chair I have been on many
 
00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
subcommittees where it does not reopen
 
00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:49.240 align:start position:0%
public testimony um I was trying to be
 
00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:50.720 align:start position:0%
sensitive to the weather but I also need
 
00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
to be sensitive to the fact that you all
 
00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:54.400 align:start position:0%
came out as well that's why I withdrew
 
00:20:56.350 --> 00:20:56.360 align:start position:0%
my motion and we withdrew the second so
 
00:20:58.149 --> 00:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
that we could have this discussion so we
 
00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:00.280 align:start position:0%
didn't I didn't hear any discussion on
 
00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:02.120 align:start position:0%
policy I heard a lot of discussion about
 
00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:05.000 align:start position:0%
um finances um which would be for a
 
00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
different committee so I'm I'm trying to
 
00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:09.320 align:start position:0%
understand where we're at can we have a
 
00:21:11.149 --> 00:21:11.159 align:start position:0%
conversation about about the actual
 
00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:14.240 align:start position:0%
policy and the impact this has on
 
00:21:16.789 --> 00:21:16.799 align:start position:0%
retirees uh so thank you for bringing
 
00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:21.080 align:start position:0%
that up as as to the policy um back in
 
00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
1988 the retirement were linked to the
 
00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:25.480 align:start position:0%
Social Security Federal benefits and it
 
00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
was calculated with an equation that had
 
00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:29.440 align:start position:0%
that um some times there were actually
 
00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
very significant reductions because of
 
00:21:34.789 --> 00:21:34.799 align:start position:0%
those Social Security aspects instead of
 
00:21:37.149 --> 00:21:37.159 align:start position:0%
having a straight level amount that you
 
00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:39.200 align:start position:0%
would have over your entire retired
 
00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:42.480 align:start position:0%
career there was the higher calculation
 
00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:44.240 align:start position:0%
prior to the retirement age so that
 
00:21:46.029 --> 00:21:46.039 align:start position:0%
there was a bonus before you were able
 
00:21:49.029 --> 00:21:49.039 align:start position:0%
to reach your full Med uh full Social
 
00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:51.400 align:start position:0%
Security retirement age I think a lot of
 
00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
this is looking at whether it's a
 
00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:54.440 align:start position:0%
reduction when you take your social
 
00:21:56.990 --> 00:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
security or if the state has offered a
 
00:21:58.950 --> 00:21:58.960 align:start position:0%
bonus to those who do choose to retire
 
00:22:00.909 --> 00:22:00.919 align:start position:0%
early knowing that they're not able to
 
00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:03.440 align:start position:0%
have that Social Security okay um I do
 
00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
see that as the bonus when you're
 
00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:07.240 align:start position:0%
retiring early because in almost any
 
00:22:09.149 --> 00:22:09.159 align:start position:0%
other place you don't get a bonus for
 
00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:11.440 align:start position:0%
retiring early Social Security if it
 
00:22:13.789 --> 00:22:13.799 align:start position:0%
take you take it early it's reduced um a
 
00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:15.480 align:start position:0%
lot of other pensions if you retire
 
00:22:17.549 --> 00:22:17.559 align:start position:0%
early it's reduced because of the longer
 
00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
time period And for those of us who have
 
00:22:22.149 --> 00:22:22.159 align:start position:0%
to contribute for our retirements it's
 
00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
also reduced because you have it over a
 
00:22:26.149 --> 00:22:26.159 align:start position:0%
lower longer Horizon so I I I do
 
00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
remember um 1988 um it was Senate Bill
 
00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:34.400 align:start position:0%
327 and when that went into effect okay
 
00:22:35.909 --> 00:22:35.919 align:start position:0%
it was a Del
 
00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
linkage between the federal and the
 
00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:41.320 align:start position:0%
state because they changed the
 
00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
age from 65 to 67 we did not change
 
00:22:49.669 --> 00:22:49.679 align:start position:0%
anything at that time so that that that
 
00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:53.000 align:start position:0%
created a d linkage which right off the
 
00:22:56.669 --> 00:22:56.679 align:start position:0%
bat that retiree got a 10% reduction
 
00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:00.400 align:start position:0%
which they did not see before
 
00:23:02.029 --> 00:23:02.039 align:start position:0%
so I'm I just want to make sure
 
00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:04.120 align:start position:0%
everybody understands the full history
 
00:23:07.789 --> 00:23:07.799 align:start position:0%
and um it's it's one of those like in
 
00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:09.720 align:start position:0%
that if you look at that representative
 
00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:11.080 align:start position:0%
you'll see the history they do an
 
00:23:14.549 --> 00:23:14.559 align:start position:0%
example of um someone who um retires at
 
00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:18.360 align:start position:0%
the age of 60 and it's a $50,000 example
 
00:23:21.149 --> 00:23:21.159 align:start position:0%
pension this example is is provided in
 
00:23:22.669 --> 00:23:22.679 align:start position:0%
that in that bill history by the New
 
00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:25.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire retirement system so it's not
 
00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:28.520 align:start position:0%
like like from any particular angle it's
 
00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:30.640 align:start position:0%
it is what it is and I would I would
 
00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:32.600 align:start position:0%
encourage everybody to to review the
 
00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:34.400 align:start position:0%
bill history on that to understand the
 
00:23:36.789 --> 00:23:36.799 align:start position:0%
policy of what this bill this bill is
 
00:23:39.269 --> 00:23:39.279 align:start position:0%
about fairness this bill is about
 
00:23:41.909 --> 00:23:41.919 align:start position:0%
fairness for these people whether or not
 
00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
it was understood by some or not last
 
00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:47.080 align:start position:0%
year or two years ago now
 
00:23:50.149 --> 00:23:50.159 align:start position:0%
um you're right at the time it was a it
 
00:23:52.909 --> 00:23:52.919 align:start position:0%
was a financial decision made by the
 
00:23:52.919 --> 00:23:54.190 align:start position:0%
was a financial decision made by the
finance

00:23:54.190 --> 00:23:54.200 align:start position:0%
finance
 
00:23:57.669 --> 00:23:57.679 align:start position:0%
committees and the policy people are the
 
00:24:00.430 --> 00:24:00.440 align:start position:0%
ones who pushed it forward in the Senate
 
00:24:03.149 --> 00:24:03.159 align:start position:0%
without regarding um having the the the
 
00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:05.080 align:start position:0%
finance and and the budget writers have
 
00:24:07.909 --> 00:24:07.919 align:start position:0%
those discussions so whether or not they
 
00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:09.640 align:start position:0%
knew it was going to leave some people
 
00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
out or not the fact is people are left
 
00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
out and what this bill is trying to do
 
00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
is to make everybody in the system
 
00:24:22.269 --> 00:24:22.279 align:start position:0%
whole well thank you for that um looking
 
00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:25.480 align:start position:0%
at the calculat prior to the entire was
 
00:24:28.830 --> 00:24:28.840 align:start position:0%
the entire number system redone in when
 
00:24:31.950 --> 00:24:31.960 align:start position:0%
it was delink because it is calculated
 
00:24:35.029 --> 00:24:35.039 align:start position:0%
as uh 166 of the final compensation
 
00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
after 65 and um and prior to that it's
 
00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:42.640 align:start position:0%
160 yes was it 160 through throughout or
 
00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:45.880 align:start position:0%
was it uh 160 throughout prior to that
 
00:24:48.789 --> 00:24:48.799 align:start position:0%
or was it 166 prior to that or was it a
 
00:24:48.799 --> 00:24:50.149 align:start position:0%
or was it 166 prior to that or was it a
different

00:24:50.149 --> 00:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:24:52.149 --> 00:24:52.159 align:start position:0%
number I want to make sure I give you
 
00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
the the most accurate best number I
 
00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
don't have that off the top of my head
 
00:24:58.789 --> 00:24:58.799 align:start position:0%
right now but I do want to get that
 
00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:01.200 align:start position:0%
correct answer for all of you that's a
 
00:25:03.789 --> 00:25:03.799 align:start position:0%
very good question okay thank you
 
00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:05.960 align:start position:0%
because uh that was a policy decision
 
00:25:08.029 --> 00:25:08.039 align:start position:0%
made in the Senate policy committee
 
00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
before it was sent to the Senate finance
 
00:25:11.549 --> 00:25:11.559 align:start position:0%
committee and they were aware of it and
 
00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:13.320 align:start position:0%
they made that policy decision but I
 
00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate that you're advocating for
 
00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
everybody that you represent sure we we
 
00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:18.120 align:start position:0%
just have to look at the fairness to
 
00:25:19.149 --> 00:25:19.159 align:start position:0%
everybody so thank you well you're
 
00:25:21.549 --> 00:25:21.559 align:start position:0%
looking at the policy and and I just I
 
00:25:22.549 --> 00:25:22.559 align:start position:0%
get a little I always get a little
 
00:25:24.549 --> 00:25:24.559 align:start position:0%
concerned when policy committees are are
 
00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:26.840 align:start position:0%
taking bills because of financial
 
00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:29.510 align:start position:0%
taking bills because of financial
thoughts

00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
thoughts

drive

00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:36.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:42.269 align:start position:0%
 
safe

00:25:42.269 --> 00:25:42.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:46.549 --> 00:25:46.559 align:start position:0%
yes yes hello my name is Karen Irwin and
 
00:25:49.669 --> 00:25:49.679 align:start position:0%
for the record I am the one that
 
00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:53.640 align:start position:0%
initiated this this year this bill um I
 
00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:56.320 align:start position:0%
am one of those that got captured in
 
00:25:59.510 --> 00:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
this I will say it was a definition
 
00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:02.440 align:start position:0%
issue if you look at the language they
 
00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:04.360 align:start position:0%
considered the language seemed to
 
00:26:08.269 --> 00:26:08.279 align:start position:0%
support everyone it said retiree members
 
00:26:11.269 --> 00:26:11.279 align:start position:0%
it was how the fiscal note was developed
 
00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:14.720 align:start position:0%
that did find retirees members as an
 
00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:18.440 align:start position:0%
active member of employment not a retire
 
00:26:20.389 --> 00:26:20.399 align:start position:0%
member of employment you would think
 
00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:22.640 align:start position:0%
when the language is reflected about
 
00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
retirees it would have encapsulated
 
00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
everyone I do remember when Senator
 
00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:29.880 align:start position:0%
Bradley pushed this through and he was a
 
00:26:33.029 --> 00:26:33.039 align:start position:0%
champion behind this Senate Bill 57 I
 
00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:35.640 align:start position:0%
asked him I said do you realize that
 
00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
those that have already retired were not
 
00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:40.720 align:start position:0%
included in this 45 million because the
 
00:26:43.630 --> 00:26:43.640 align:start position:0%
fiscal note didn't match the language of
 
00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
the bill that is the history that I'm
 
00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
familiar with if you look at that
 
00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
language there's no
 
00:26:51.870 --> 00:26:51.880 align:start position:0%
differentiation of what a retiring
 
00:26:54.389 --> 00:26:54.399 align:start position:0%
member is in any kind of legislative
 
00:26:57.990 --> 00:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
support so it was a determination by I'm
 
00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:00.360 align:start position:0%
sorry sorry but the retirement system to
 
00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
Define retiree member as somebody that
 
00:27:06.669 --> 00:27:06.679 align:start position:0%
was only an active employee that had not
 
00:27:11.669 --> 00:27:11.679 align:start position:0%
yet retired so we there's most of us now
 
00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:14.360 align:start position:0%
that are retiring at this time frame and
 
00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
I put that in my testimony would be age
 
00:27:20.789 --> 00:27:20.799 align:start position:0%
you know in the year birth date 1958 to
 
00:27:20.799 --> 00:27:21.750 align:start position:0%
you know in the year birth date 1958 to
probably

00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:21.760 align:start position:0%
probably
 
00:27:25.909 --> 00:27:25.919 align:start position:0%
1962 that's my estimation of what those
 
00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:28.200 align:start position:0%
ages that are captured in this and
 
00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:31.240 align:start position:0%
anybody 1960 and older are now full
 
00:27:32.510 --> 00:27:32.520 align:start position:0%
retirement is
 
00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
67 so the what Bob was referring to is
 
00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
it had been a disconnect it wasn't a
 
00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
bonus it was a reduction because uh
 
00:27:46.149 --> 00:27:46.159 align:start position:0%
retirees got Social Security and so when
 
00:27:48.549 --> 00:27:48.559 align:start position:0%
they got Social Security added they said
 
00:27:51.389 --> 00:27:51.399 align:start position:0%
we can reduce your pension by 10%
 
00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
because you're getting more money that
 
00:27:56.269 --> 00:27:56.279 align:start position:0%
disconnect existed for over 20 years
 
00:27:59.470 --> 00:27:59.480 align:start position:0%
till Senate Bill 57 I don't 20 or more
 
00:28:01.509 --> 00:28:01.519 align:start position:0%
years you know maybe I guess it's 19
 
00:28:04.990 --> 00:28:05.000 align:start position:0%
that'll be you know 35 years it was a
 
00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:07.720 align:start position:0%
disconnect that people were like okay I
 
00:28:09.509 --> 00:28:09.519 align:start position:0%
have to pay more for my
 
00:28:12.509 --> 00:28:12.519 align:start position:0%
medical I can't take my Social Security
 
00:28:15.149 --> 00:28:15.159 align:start position:0%
without getting a a discount and I
 
00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
reflected to you in my age group I would
 
00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
be taking it two years early if I really
 
00:28:23.549 --> 00:28:23.559 align:start position:0%
needed that money I would need I and
 
00:28:26.389 --> 00:28:26.399 align:start position:0%
because I couldn't support that 10%
 
00:28:28.669 --> 00:28:28.679 align:start position:0%
decrease that loss in
 
00:28:31.269 --> 00:28:31.279 align:start position:0%
income then I would also have to take my
 
00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
Social Security two years early so those
 
00:28:38.430 --> 00:28:38.440 align:start position:0%
two decreases were in my case with 36
 
00:28:40.630 --> 00:28:40.640 align:start position:0%
years in the retirement system
 
00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
$836 I think is what I said but I just
 
00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:46.720 align:start position:0%
wanted to get that history for you it
 
00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:50.240 align:start position:0%
really wasn't all knowledgeable because
 
00:28:51.789 --> 00:28:51.799 align:start position:0%
the one that was leading the charge
 
00:28:53.710 --> 00:28:53.720 align:start position:0%
didn't even know it until I pointed it
 
00:28:55.470 --> 00:28:55.480 align:start position:0%
out to him and it was too late in the
 
00:28:57.630 --> 00:28:57.640 align:start position:0%
game you know they all said to me it was
 
00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
too late in the game to go back and get
 
00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:02.720 align:start position:0%
another fiscal note or do anything so
 
00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:04.440 align:start position:0%
they had to go through and support
 
00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:07.200 align:start position:0%
everybody supported it just being active
 
00:29:11.389 --> 00:29:11.399 align:start position:0%
members and not retiree members and so
 
00:29:13.950 --> 00:29:13.960 align:start position:0%
we're simply asking it for for it to be
 
00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:18.440 align:start position:0%
you know fair and and um and what I also
 
00:29:22.029 --> 00:29:22.039 align:start position:0%
testified to is because we're recent
 
00:29:26.389 --> 00:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
retirees um in my case I had
 
00:29:28.909 --> 00:29:28.919 align:start position:0%
$34,000 in my person
 
00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:33.880 align:start position:0%
account my cut was $4.69 I think you
 
00:29:38.950 --> 00:29:38.960 align:start position:0%
know and that was just mine but um and
 
00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
if you kind of if you kick it out
 
00:29:43.470 --> 00:29:43.480 align:start position:0%
because I haven't used up all my money
 
00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
for six years you let us have the
 
00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
continued amount till we've reach four
 
00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:53.480 align:start position:0%
um you know age 67 in my case that it
 
00:29:56.590 --> 00:29:56.600 align:start position:0%
really doesn't kick in that um unfunded
 
00:29:59.190 --> 00:29:59.200 align:start position:0%
liability to much later because all of
 
00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:02.320 align:start position:0%
our pensions come out of that first
 
00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
roughly six years of our money first so
 
00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
to speak our money and um the 7% we put
 
00:30:11.909 --> 00:30:11.919 align:start position:0%
in all over all those years and
 
00:30:14.149 --> 00:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
Everything's Relative because depends on
 
00:30:15.710 --> 00:30:15.720 align:start position:0%
how many years you have but it's all
 
00:30:18.509 --> 00:30:18.519 align:start position:0%
kind of a relative thing so my 10% is
 
00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:19.840 align:start position:0%
that amount because I have a lot of
 
00:30:21.789 --> 00:30:21.799 align:start position:0%
years in you know other people won't
 
00:30:25.310 --> 00:30:25.320 align:start position:0%
have much so I hope you will go to the
 
00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
policy of this bill because if you look
 
00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
at the history it is unfair that and it
 
00:30:33.149 --> 00:30:33.159 align:start position:0%
was an oversight as far as I was
 
00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:35.240 align:start position:0%
concerned because they was how it was
 
00:30:37.950 --> 00:30:37.960 align:start position:0%
defined which is not in Statue again on
 
00:30:41.070 --> 00:30:41.080 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note so uh thank you for this
 
00:30:43.710 --> 00:30:43.720 align:start position:0%
time though and I hope you will change
 
00:30:46.830 --> 00:30:46.840 align:start position:0%
your mind on that idea with this history
 
00:30:49.470 --> 00:30:49.480 align:start position:0%
and let it go I do think there's things
 
00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:52.640 align:start position:0%
that could be done on the fiscal side to
 
00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
support um maybe an alternative because
 
00:30:58.830 --> 00:30:58.840 align:start position:0%
this is a little narrow window of time
 
00:31:00.669 --> 00:31:00.679 align:start position:0%
basically I showed in my spreadsheet it
 
00:31:04.149 --> 00:31:04.159 align:start position:0%
was from this fiscal year going to about
 
00:31:07.149 --> 00:31:07.159 align:start position:0%
30 is what you would capture everybody
 
00:31:10.269 --> 00:31:10.279 align:start position:0%
you know and so I'm not understanding
 
00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:12.760 align:start position:0%
such a big number still I mean I know
 
00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
the legislature has total control over
 
00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
what they're doing here and um I'm just
 
00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:21.720 align:start position:0%
let it get to the next step you know and
 
00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:25.240 align:start position:0%
let let us hash through the fiscal stuff
 
00:31:27.909 --> 00:31:27.919 align:start position:0%
with somebody because that 45 million
 
00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
ion is in the retirement system even if
 
00:31:32.629 --> 00:31:32.639 align:start position:0%
you looked at it as and the assumed rate
 
00:31:35.710 --> 00:31:35.720 align:start position:0%
of return was 6.75 and I think we earned
 
00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:38.440 align:start position:0%
9.8 last year you know even if you
 
00:31:41.310 --> 00:31:41.320 align:start position:0%
looked at that money and said maybe that
 
00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
2% could help pay for this you know I
 
00:31:47.190 --> 00:31:47.200 align:start position:0%
was something it seems like we could do
 
00:31:49.470 --> 00:31:49.480 align:start position:0%
something on that those lines you could
 
00:31:52.029 --> 00:31:52.039 align:start position:0%
tie it together and make it full circle
 
00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:53.360 align:start position:0%
because the language is there in the
 
00:31:57.029 --> 00:31:57.039 align:start position:0%
first place it really isn't defined and
 
00:31:59.350 --> 00:31:59.360 align:start position:0%
so if the Lang which was to me an
 
00:32:02.149 --> 00:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
oversight I'm it wasn't clearly spelled
 
00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
out to even the legislators that we were
 
00:32:07.590 --> 00:32:07.600 align:start position:0%
leaving out a section of people so thank
 
00:32:09.950 --> 00:32:09.960 align:start position:0%
you did the did the any of the terms of
 
00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
your retirement change though in that
 
00:32:14.149 --> 00:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
period um from the time when you chose
 
00:32:16.549 --> 00:32:16.559 align:start position:0%
to retire early were they the same terms
 
00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
that you retired under that you're still
 
00:32:20.389 --> 00:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
um living under
 
00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
today did the terms ever change no it
 
00:32:27.230 --> 00:32:27.240 align:start position:0%
was it was always making up for the
 
00:32:30.629 --> 00:32:30.639 align:start position:0%
original intention way back when was
 
00:32:32.789 --> 00:32:32.799 align:start position:0%
that you would not get impacted and
 
00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:34.480 align:start position:0%
everybody's like whoever hears of a
 
00:32:36.950 --> 00:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
pension going down after you retire
 
00:32:40.149 --> 00:32:40.159 align:start position:0%
usually you get a flat pension and so it
 
00:32:43.350 --> 00:32:43.360 align:start position:0%
was a purpose legislative intent to
 
00:32:46.669 --> 00:32:46.679 align:start position:0%
decrease it at Social Security age never
 
00:32:49.389 --> 00:32:49.399 align:start position:0%
was an intent to do anything else it was
 
00:32:52.149 --> 00:32:52.159 align:start position:0%
just that it cost so much money you know
 
00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
if you're going to change it
 
00:32:56.710 --> 00:32:56.720 align:start position:0%
forever that they didn't have the money
 
00:32:59.269 --> 00:32:59.279 align:start position:0%
from year to year to do it now they've
 
00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
done the Lion's Share of this but you
 
00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
know it seems like there's there's a way
 
00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:09.720 align:start position:0%
to alternatively looking at this for
 
00:33:13.389 --> 00:33:13.399 align:start position:0%
finance but that that to me is a finance
 
00:33:16.909 --> 00:33:16.919 align:start position:0%
decision and I wish you would pass this
 
00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
on the principle that it is kind of
 
00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
unfair and I really if you go look at
 
00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:23.600 align:start position:0%
the language and do your analysis you
 
00:33:26.029 --> 00:33:26.039 align:start position:0%
will see what I'm saying in the language
 
00:33:28.629 --> 00:33:28.639 align:start position:0%
you would not support that it would
 
00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
leave out a group of people that were
 
00:33:33.909 --> 00:33:33.919 align:start position:0%
actual retirees so know that's the
 
00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
history no thank you for that history
 
00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:39.480 align:start position:0%
and um in the history from the Senate it
 
00:33:43.789 --> 00:33:43.799 align:start position:0%
was brought up on January 18th of 2023
 
00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:45.480 align:start position:0%
um Unfortunately they did have time
 
00:33:46.909 --> 00:33:46.919 align:start position:0%
where they could have amended that but
 
00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:48.880 align:start position:0%
they they chose not to and I'm really
 
00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:51.960 align:start position:0%
sorry for that but thank you well I mean
 
00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:54.360 align:start position:0%
this was on the last days you know I
 
00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:57.480 align:start position:0%
would talked to Jeb Bradley and CU and
 
00:33:59.830 --> 00:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
he wasn't aware of that
 
00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:02.240 align:start position:0%
so thank you are there any questions
 
00:34:03.870 --> 00:34:03.880 align:start position:0%
from the he was Senate President during
 
00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
that time
 
00:34:07.270 --> 00:34:07.280 align:start position:0%
yes I'm
 
00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
sorry sorry representative Howard thank
 
00:34:12.790 --> 00:34:12.800 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question so I was
 
00:34:14.950 --> 00:34:14.960 align:start position:0%
curious if you had any information about
 
00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
some of the other states in the country
 
00:34:19.349 --> 00:34:19.359 align:start position:0%
and whether or not uh they are facing
 
00:34:21.589 --> 00:34:21.599 align:start position:0%
similar problems with their Retirement
 
00:34:21.599 --> 00:34:23.790 align:start position:0%
similar problems with their Retirement
Systems

00:34:23.790 --> 00:34:23.800 align:start position:0%
Systems
 
00:34:26.349 --> 00:34:26.359 align:start position:0%
um I guess I would you know wouldn't
 
00:34:28.430 --> 00:34:28.440 align:start position:0%
Define it
 
00:34:31.869 --> 00:34:31.879 align:start position:0%
as a problem it was just our policy to
 
00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
decrease so I don't think any other you
 
00:34:36.750 --> 00:34:36.760 align:start position:0%
know I don't know of any other states
 
00:34:40.750 --> 00:34:40.760 align:start position:0%
where they decrease the amount of um
 
00:34:43.669 --> 00:34:43.679 align:start position:0%
money based on reaching Social Security
 
00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:45.240 align:start position:0%
age I don't know of anybody that has
 
00:34:47.069 --> 00:34:47.079 align:start position:0%
that tie in but so I don't have that
 
00:34:47.079 --> 00:34:48.629 align:start position:0%
that tie in but so I don't have that
information

00:34:48.629 --> 00:34:48.639 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:34:51.270 --> 00:34:51.280 align:start position:0%
but yeah thank you thank you and if you
 
00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:52.720 align:start position:0%
can make sure to send a pain card up
 
00:34:55.430 --> 00:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
that'd be help yeah thank you
 
00:34:58.310 --> 00:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
I what did I do bar
 
00:35:01.470 --> 00:35:01.480 align:start position:0%
I I I okay thank
 
00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:04.640 align:start position:0%
you yes you wanted to speak yes please
 
00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
thank you so um it seems to me there are
 
00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:08.720 align:start position:0%
couple of things happening here and
 
00:35:10.190 --> 00:35:10.200 align:start position:0%
maybe it's just because I'm new and I'm
 
00:35:12.630 --> 00:35:12.640 align:start position:0%
not understanding which is uh that that
 
00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
happens a lot but um
 
00:35:18.670 --> 00:35:18.680 align:start position:0%
the when I heard discussion um at the
 
00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:20.960 align:start position:0%
beginning it did sound like it was the
 
00:35:22.950 --> 00:35:22.960 align:start position:0%
finances that would be the reason that
 
00:35:24.990 --> 00:35:25.000 align:start position:0%
we would be voting against that and that
 
00:35:28.030 --> 00:35:28.040 align:start position:0%
is not what my understanding was of role
 
00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:30.640 align:start position:0%
of this committee I understood us to be
 
00:35:32.069 --> 00:35:32.079 align:start position:0%
um looking at the fairness and the
 
00:35:35.190 --> 00:35:35.200 align:start position:0%
equity of the policy um and I understood
 
00:35:37.870 --> 00:35:37.880 align:start position:0%
this bill to be cleaning up a mistake
 
00:35:40.069 --> 00:35:40.079 align:start position:0%
now you're you're sharing um and I
 
00:35:42.829 --> 00:35:42.839 align:start position:0%
appreciate it um that You' say that it
 
00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:45.280 align:start position:0%
could have 50 Senate Bill 57 could have
 
00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
been fixed on the Senate side um which
 
00:35:49.589 --> 00:35:49.599 align:start position:0%
is contrary to what I'm hearing from
 
00:35:52.109 --> 00:35:52.119 align:start position:0%
people who are testifying today and I
 
00:35:55.510 --> 00:35:55.520 align:start position:0%
would like um to have more time to dig
 
00:35:57.150 --> 00:35:57.160 align:start position:0%
into that because I don't feel as though
 
00:35:59.390 --> 00:35:59.400 align:start position:0%
we have enough information I appreciate
 
00:36:02.309 --> 00:36:02.319 align:start position:0%
what what you said Madam chair um and
 
00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:04.440 align:start position:0%
and because you said it I want to go and
 
00:36:06.550 --> 00:36:06.560 align:start position:0%
study it I am not particularly
 
00:36:10.670 --> 00:36:10.680 align:start position:0%
comfortable um where there is a conflict
 
00:36:13.589 --> 00:36:13.599 align:start position:0%
uh between two people's understanding
 
00:36:15.470 --> 00:36:15.480 align:start position:0%
moving forward and I'm especially not
 
00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
comfortable doing that um at a time
 
00:36:21.950 --> 00:36:21.960 align:start position:0%
where where um it sounded to me like we
 
00:36:23.710 --> 00:36:23.720 align:start position:0%
were getting at a inexpedient to
 
00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:25.390 align:start position:0%
were getting at a inexpedient to
legislate

00:36:25.390 --> 00:36:25.400 align:start position:0%
legislate
 
00:36:27.630 --> 00:36:27.640 align:start position:0%
recommendation because of how much this
 
00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
was going to cost us instead of the
 
00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:32.800 align:start position:0%
question of whether or not um we should
 
00:36:35.069 --> 00:36:35.079 align:start position:0%
be we should be doing this for for
 
00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
people who were participating in the
 
00:36:38.829 --> 00:36:38.839 align:start position:0%
system so that might those are my two
 
00:36:41.950 --> 00:36:41.960 align:start position:0%
cents maybe I'm misunderstanding um but
 
00:36:45.230 --> 00:36:45.240 align:start position:0%
i' i' i' particularly appreciate not
 
00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:47.800 align:start position:0%
taking a vote on this today thank you
 
00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:50.480 align:start position:0%
thank you um I do agree that
 
00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:51.680 align:start position:0%
understanding the true legislative
 
00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:53.680 align:start position:0%
history of this bill is important and
 
00:36:55.630 --> 00:36:55.640 align:start position:0%
that's why the records from the Senate
 
00:36:58.349 --> 00:36:58.359 align:start position:0%
hearing on January 18th it is in the
 
00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:00.960 align:start position:0%
minutes that it was raised it was voted
 
00:37:03.829 --> 00:37:03.839 align:start position:0%
without changing it um I I can get the
 
00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:05.680 align:start position:0%
particular dates it was voted in
 
00:37:08.349 --> 00:37:08.359 align:start position:0%
committee and on the floor from Edna in
 
00:37:10.829 --> 00:37:10.839 align:start position:0%
the Senate without changing it it was
 
00:37:13.309 --> 00:37:13.319 align:start position:0%
heard in finance again in the Senate
 
00:37:14.990 --> 00:37:15.000 align:start position:0%
where it was brought up and it was not
 
00:37:17.470 --> 00:37:17.480 align:start position:0%
changed and then it was added to the
 
00:37:19.829 --> 00:37:19.839 align:start position:0%
budget which was a whole another one
 
00:37:21.910 --> 00:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
which I think is an 800 page committee
 
00:37:24.109 --> 00:37:24.119 align:start position:0%
report so I definitely didn't print that
 
00:37:26.910 --> 00:37:26.920 align:start position:0%
one um but I can find the specific pages
 
00:37:29.430 --> 00:37:29.440 align:start position:0%
from that where it was brought up again
 
00:37:32.030 --> 00:37:32.040 align:start position:0%
and um there were various Advocates who
 
00:37:33.910 --> 00:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
continued to Advocate just for those
 
00:37:36.990 --> 00:37:37.000 align:start position:0%
people who had not yet retired and there
 
00:37:39.470 --> 00:37:39.480 align:start position:0%
was not advocacy um from the groups for
 
00:37:42.190 --> 00:37:42.200 align:start position:0%
those who had previously retired and um
 
00:37:44.069 --> 00:37:44.079 align:start position:0%
although I'm sure that individuals were
 
00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
advocating for that but I but um most of
 
00:37:49.630 --> 00:37:49.640 align:start position:0%
it was in support of moving forward with
 
00:37:51.630 --> 00:37:51.640 align:start position:0%
those who they could so it was a policy
 
00:37:53.630 --> 00:37:53.640 align:start position:0%
decision and since this was brought to
 
00:37:57.670 --> 00:37:57.680 align:start position:0%
us to clean up an inadvertent oversight
 
00:37:59.470 --> 00:37:59.480 align:start position:0%
that was not an inadvertent oversight it
 
00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:03.680 align:start position:0%
is a policy issue um further we are the
 
00:38:05.349 --> 00:38:05.359 align:start position:0%
only it seems that we're the only state
 
00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
that does pay people more before they
 
00:38:10.670 --> 00:38:10.680 align:start position:0%
reach full retirement age um and if
 
00:38:13.109 --> 00:38:13.119 align:start position:0%
we're whether one of a few states that
 
00:38:15.430 --> 00:38:15.440 align:start position:0%
pay more before full retirement age or
 
00:38:17.069 --> 00:38:17.079 align:start position:0%
the only one that pays more before full
 
00:38:19.510 --> 00:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
retirement age that is to make sure that
 
00:38:21.470 --> 00:38:21.480 align:start position:0%
people are not facing as many challenges
 
00:38:22.870 --> 00:38:22.880 align:start position:0%
when they're not able to also receive
 
00:38:24.990 --> 00:38:25.000 align:start position:0%
Social Security so with that I will
 
00:38:29.109 --> 00:38:29.119 align:start position:0%
again move in expedient to legislate
 
00:38:32.069 --> 00:38:32.079 align:start position:0%
okay and um more discussion or should we
 
00:38:33.670 --> 00:38:33.680 align:start position:0%
just go ahead and
 
00:38:37.030 --> 00:38:37.040 align:start position:0%
vote so we will go ahead and vote uh
 
00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:38.430 align:start position:0%
vote so we will go ahead and vote uh

recommendation out of the subcommittee
 
00:38:56.870 --> 00:38:56.880 align:start position:0%

00:38:58.950 --> 00:38:58.960 align:start position:0%
subcommittee hearing um we will schedule

after session next week for other bills
 
00:39:05.309 --> 00:39:05.319 align:start position:0%
that we have assuming that we don't have
 
00:39:07.550 --> 00:39:07.560 align:start position:0%
a larger floor schedule than we had
 
00:39:10.910 --> 00:39:10.920 align:start position:0%
