Amendment rep representa representative
 
00:16:29.949 --> 00:16:29.959 align:start position:0%
wolf you wish to speak
 
00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:32.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I'm going to pass
 
00:16:35.389 --> 00:16:35.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:38.360 align:start position:0%
amendment hopefully everybody has gotten
 
00:16:46.309 --> 00:16:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:49.749 --> 00:16:49.759 align:start position:0%
email I'm finishing an eighth
 
00:16:52.189 --> 00:16:52.199 align:start position:0%
year in the
 
00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
legislature and I have never been quite
 
00:16:59.509 --> 00:16:59.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:03.400 align:start position:0%
but I have come to a decision on this
 
00:17:06.549 --> 00:17:06.559 align:start position:0%
thing because I
 
00:17:11.189 --> 00:17:11.199 align:start position:0%
believe in preserving the
 
00:17:15.549 --> 00:17:15.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:18.029 --> 00:17:18.039 align:start position:0%
Generations I know that there have been
 
00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
a lot of threats if we don't do X then Y
 
00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:23.480 align:start position:0%
is going to
 
00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:25.270 align:start position:0%
is going to
happen

00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
happen
 
00:17:27.909 --> 00:17:27.919 align:start position:0%
and I can't take a chance with those
 
00:17:27.919 --> 00:17:29.470 align:start position:0%
and I can't take a chance with those
threats

00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:29.480 align:start position:0%
threats
 
00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:32.320 align:start position:0%
so I'm offering
 
00:17:58.870 --> 00:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
it's a good
 
00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:04.400 align:start position:0%
compromise and I underline and tsize and
 
00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:07.480 align:start position:0%
bold the word compromise this bill
 
00:18:10.909 --> 00:18:10.919 align:start position:0%
started out at 500
 
00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:14.360 align:start position:0%
feet the Senate came and said 200
 
00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:17.000 align:start position:0%
feet and we're not going to compromise
 
00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:19.360 align:start position:0%
on that do we have a leak in the ceiling
 
00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:23.720 align:start position:0%
we do I'm getting wet right here I just
 
00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:26.840 align:start position:0%
thought all right maybe maybe there's a
 
00:18:28.789 --> 00:18:28.799 align:start position:0%
message and I'm going to let you
 
00:18:30.669 --> 00:18:30.679 align:start position:0%
interpret what the message might be I
 
00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
just thought you were
 
00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:36.440 align:start position:0%
sweating no Andy when I make up my mind
 
00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
I don't
 
00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:41.320 align:start position:0%
sweat yeah don't yeah otherwise you may
 
00:18:43.549 --> 00:18:43.559 align:start position:0%
not finish your
 
00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:46.640 align:start position:0%
so I am
 
00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:50.840 align:start position:0%
speaking that and hopefully we have made
 
00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:54.280 align:start position:0%
and you will help me make a meaningful
 
00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
compromise we already have a 300t
 
00:18:59.710 --> 00:18:59.720 align:start position:0%
setback on lakes
 
00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
for twers skis jet skis so this is
 
00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:09.480 align:start position:0%
nothing new 300 ft is easily
 
00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:12.400 align:start position:0%
definable is it the ultimate answer on
 
00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:13.630 align:start position:0%
definable is it the ultimate answer on
this

00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:13.640 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:17.360 align:start position:0%
no we need to have people use some
 
00:19:21.149 --> 00:19:21.159 align:start position:0%
common sense we need to have
 
00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:25.000 align:start position:0%
people work to protect the
 
00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.110 align:start position:0%
people work to protect the
environment

00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
environment
 
00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:30.320 align:start position:0%
and would like to to see this bill
 
00:19:33.669 --> 00:19:33.679 align:start position:0%
pass as a compromise For What
 
00:19:36.549 --> 00:19:36.559 align:start position:0%
legislation is when you come to this
 
00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:40.760 align:start position:0%
house you try to find a reasonable
 
00:19:43.909 --> 00:19:43.919 align:start position:0%
balance I think that the 300 foot is a
 
00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:46.240 align:start position:0%
reasonable balance it's not going to
 
00:19:52.029 --> 00:19:52.039 align:start position:0%
deny anybody the ability to to wake
 
00:19:56.110 --> 00:19:56.120 align:start position:0%
surve and more importantly we are not
 
00:19:57.630 --> 00:19:57.640 align:start position:0%
Banning an
 
00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:01.120 align:start position:0%
activity I have a lot of friends that
 
00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
have wake boats and I hope that they
 
00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:06.360 align:start position:0%
will continue to be able to use them and
 
00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
I hope that the Lakes will remain clear
 
00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
and without being overrun by
 
00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria Zebra
 
00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
muscles and other Aquatic species that
 
00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:22.280 align:start position:0%
are dragged up so I have moved the
 
00:20:25.149 --> 00:20:25.159 align:start position:0%
adoption of wherever it
 
00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:29.440 align:start position:0%
is House Bill Amendment
 
00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:34.760 align:start position:0%
20241 1598 and I ask you all to consider
 
00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:40.280 align:start position:0%
this as not being bullied into something
 
00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:43.320 align:start position:0%
okay thank you all right
 
00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:46.400 align:start position:0%
uh I I I gave you the courtesy of not
 
00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
interrupting you but you do need a
 
00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:50.280 align:start position:0%
second for this so you're going to have
 
00:20:52.909 --> 00:20:52.919 align:start position:0%
to do that all over
 
00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:56.840 align:start position:0%
again no well okay uh thank you for for
 
00:21:00.029 --> 00:21:00.039 align:start position:0%
a second representative La montain I
 
00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
recognize for a second you wish to speak
 
00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:04.760 align:start position:0%
to your
 
00:21:08.909 --> 00:21:08.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
do yes I I think 200 a 200 foot setback
 
00:21:15.909 --> 00:21:15.919 align:start position:0%
is makes is going to make very little
 
00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
difference in protecting water water
 
00:21:21.029 --> 00:21:21.039 align:start position:0%
quality which is why well I wouldn't say
 
00:21:24.789 --> 00:21:24.799 align:start position:0%
it's why the Marine industry supports it
 
00:21:27.149 --> 00:21:27.159 align:start position:0%
but it it's very little sacrifice for
 
00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
them and I feel that to
 
00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:35.360 align:start position:0%
adopt this um bill without the
 
00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:39.240 align:start position:0%
amendment is telling the Marine service
 
00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:41.480 align:start position:0%
industry and everyone else that they
 
00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:43.240 align:start position:0%
don't need to compromise
 
00:21:46.549 --> 00:21:46.559 align:start position:0%
further I think 300 feet is a reasonable
 
00:21:49.669 --> 00:21:49.679 align:start position:0%
compromise and I think we must do
 
00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:52.240 align:start position:0%
something about this to protect our
 
00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
lakes and that has to be a higher
 
00:21:58.630 --> 00:21:58.640 align:start position:0%
priority than the recreational interest
 
00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
of a few people to enjoy their sport
 
00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
when it damages the water quality it
 
00:22:08.789 --> 00:22:08.799 align:start position:0%
makes it harder for other people to
 
00:22:12.549 --> 00:22:12.559 align:start position:0%
enjoy the lake just by swimming or on a
 
00:22:15.149 --> 00:22:15.159 align:start position:0%
paddle board or a
 
00:22:18.269 --> 00:22:18.279 align:start position:0%
kayak and I think we need to go for the
 
00:22:22.909 --> 00:22:22.919 align:start position:0%
300 foot setback and continue to argue
 
00:22:22.919 --> 00:22:24.070 align:start position:0%
300 foot setback and continue to argue
for

00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:26.720 align:start position:0%
that you know as it as it goes back to
 
00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
the as it goes to the house floor and
 
00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
the Senate and to the governor's desk
 
00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:33.640 align:start position:0%
that we need to do the right thing and
 
00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
not be pressured into passing this bill
 
00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
without an amendment that basically does
 
00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
nothing additional 100 feet would do
 
00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:48.360 align:start position:0%
nothing so let's make an actual step
 
00:22:52.269 --> 00:22:52.279 align:start position:0%
forward to have some restrictions on
 
00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:55.960 align:start position:0%
this sport that can cause so much damage
 
00:22:59.149 --> 00:22:59.159 align:start position:0%
I mean does anyone really think making
 
00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:02.200 align:start position:0%
an ocean wave in a
 
00:23:05.029 --> 00:23:05.039 align:start position:0%
lake it's fall freshwater lake is not
 
00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:07.400 align:start position:0%
going to cause huge environmental
 
00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:10.480 align:start position:0%
impacts of course it does so let's do
 
00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:12.400 align:start position:0%
the right
 
00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:15.640 align:start position:0%
thing anyone wish to speak on the
 
00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
amendment representative Derby thank you
 
00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
Mr chair oh sorry excuse me I
 
00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
representative Bale first no she asked
 
00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
first I'm mistake no I representative
 
00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:31.720 align:start position:0%
bail first then representative
 
00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
Darby thank you um we took extensive
 
00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:39.240 align:start position:0%
testimony on this bill and um I agree
 
00:23:41.909 --> 00:23:41.919 align:start position:0%
with my colleague representative lontine
 
00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
the 200 fet is just not enough and we
 
00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
heard in testimony that if we P you know
 
00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
we should pass this bill that it's going
 
00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:54.760 align:start position:0%
to put the matter to rest but I don't
 
00:23:56.990 --> 00:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
think that that's really what's going to
 
00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
happen I think we had two house bills
 
00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:02.840 align:start position:0%
they went to the floor they didn't get
 
00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:04.760 align:start position:0%
argued the way that we hoped that they
 
00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:07.320 align:start position:0%
would and we didn't get a chance to
 
00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
flesh out all the
 
00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:13.080 align:start position:0%
details in front of the body so when we
 
00:24:15.549 --> 00:24:15.559 align:start position:0%
look at this and we try to come down
 
00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
there with our own position where our
 
00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
position is not 200
 
00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:21.720 align:start position:0%
feet so that's why I'm going to be
 
00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
voting in favor of the amendment and I'm
 
00:24:28.789 --> 00:24:28.799 align:start position:0%
going to just help um just
 
00:24:31.149 --> 00:24:31.159 align:start position:0%
the shorelines don't recover from this
 
00:24:33.870 --> 00:24:33.880 align:start position:0%
kind of energy when a wave is created
 
00:24:36.789 --> 00:24:36.799 align:start position:0%
there is energy going out across a lake
 
00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
however far that wave has to go before
 
00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
it hits the friction is where the energy
 
00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
is going to keep on going and so when it
 
00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:46.720 align:start position:0%
hits that Shoreline and that Shoreline
 
00:24:48.789 --> 00:24:48.799 align:start position:0%
takes the energy when it hits an animal
 
00:24:54.269 --> 00:24:54.279 align:start position:0%
when it hits a um a nesting bird a kayak
 
00:24:57.549 --> 00:24:57.559 align:start position:0%
that person is going to feel that energy
 
00:24:59.789 --> 00:24:59.799 align:start position:0%
and that impact and that's one sport and
 
00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:02.520 align:start position:0%
we have a lake full of people trying to
 
00:25:05.909 --> 00:25:05.919 align:start position:0%
have um community recreation and try to
 
00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:08.600 align:start position:0%
all recreate in the same space together
 
00:25:12.149 --> 00:25:12.159 align:start position:0%
so those are the reasons basically that
 
00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:14.360 align:start position:0%
I think we should go ahead and pass this
 
00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:16.120 align:start position:0%
amendment and I'm asking everyone to
 
00:25:19.389 --> 00:25:19.399 align:start position:0%
support the amendment thank
 
00:25:23.070 --> 00:25:23.080 align:start position:0%
you representative Darby for comment
 
00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
chair we know that wake surfing can
 
00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:31.120 align:start position:0%
impact act Lake quality and Wildlife how
 
00:25:33.149 --> 00:25:33.159 align:start position:0%
do we know because the Senate Bill tells
 
00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:36.520 align:start position:0%
us so that's why it uh indicates that
 
00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:38.480 align:start position:0%
the best practice is to direct wake
 
00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:41.360 align:start position:0%
waves away from the shoreline we know
 
00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
because the water sports industry
 
00:25:45.909 --> 00:25:45.919 align:start position:0%
Association tells us not to wake surf in
 
00:25:48.269 --> 00:25:48.279 align:start position:0%
shallow water we know because New
 
00:25:51.269 --> 00:25:51.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Dees tells us that increasing
 
00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:53.080 align:start position:0%
the buffers the further away you get
 
00:25:55.630 --> 00:25:55.640 align:start position:0%
from the shore the less risk there is to
 
00:25:58.950 --> 00:25:58.960 align:start position:0%
to the Shoreline that we also know
 
00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
um from Dees that wig surfing in shallow
 
00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:04.360 align:start position:0%
water under 20 ft can increase the
 
00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
phosphorus load up to 20% Which um
 
00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
contributes to cyanobacteria blooms and
 
00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:12.320 align:start position:0%
lengthen Bloom blooms in
 
00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:16.240 align:start position:0%
progress our our fellow um there are not
 
00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
many uh uh States in this nation that
 
00:26:22.029 --> 00:26:22.039 align:start position:0%
are blessed with the natural lakes that
 
00:26:23.389 --> 00:26:23.399 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:26:26.789 --> 00:26:26.799 align:start position:0%
has four of them are actively taking
 
00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:31.120 align:start position:0%
action to um to increase the buffers for
 
00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:34.240 align:start position:0%
wake surfing our direct neighbors both
 
00:26:36.870 --> 00:26:36.880 align:start position:0%
Maine and Vermont have already done that
 
00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
with a 500 foot 20 uh 500 foot setback
 
00:26:42.909 --> 00:26:42.919 align:start position:0%
20 foot minimum depth and Main with a
 
00:26:46.669 --> 00:26:46.679 align:start position:0%
300 foot uh setback 15 foot minimum
 
00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:49.200 align:start position:0%
depth the Michigan Department of Natural
 
00:26:51.070 --> 00:26:51.080 align:start position:0%
Resources which is equivalent to our
 
00:26:54.269 --> 00:26:54.279 align:start position:0%
department of environmental uh uh
 
00:26:58.990 --> 00:26:59.000 align:start position:0%
Services did a comprehensive well quoted
 
00:26:59.000 --> 00:26:59.830 align:start position:0%
Services did a comprehensive well quoted
um

00:26:59.830 --> 00:26:59.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
study over 50 sources and found and
 
00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
their analysis was that 500 feet with a
 
00:27:11.029 --> 00:27:11.039 align:start position:0%
15 uh off setback with a 15 foot minimum
 
00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
depth is
 
00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
required so our peers our Pier states
 
00:27:18.029 --> 00:27:18.039 align:start position:0%
with natural lakes which by like I said
 
00:27:19.549 --> 00:27:19.559 align:start position:0%
is not the majority of the states in
 
00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:21.960 align:start position:0%
this nation are are taking action
 
00:27:24.149 --> 00:27:24.159 align:start position:0%
because they know the the they know the
 
00:27:25.870 --> 00:27:25.880 align:start position:0%
risk to our
 
00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:28.480 align:start position:0%
Lakes we've heard of the study
 
00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:31.480 align:start position:0%
referenced by uh the Marine trades
 
00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:33.960 align:start position:0%
Association it's very interesting to
 
00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
note that that study was produced after
 
00:27:40.149 --> 00:27:40.159 align:start position:0%
the Wake responsibility campaign that uh
 
00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:43.000 align:start position:0%
that promoted a 200 foot setback which
 
00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:45.440 align:start position:0%
was initially promoted in uh
 
00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:47.840 align:start position:0%
2018 it's also interesting to note that
 
00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:50.720 align:start position:0%
if you read that study which I've read
 
00:27:53.350 --> 00:27:53.360 align:start position:0%
they tell you that the own authors claim
 
00:27:56.909 --> 00:27:56.919 align:start position:0%
that it's impossible to um gauge weight
 
00:27:58.710 --> 00:27:58.720 align:start position:0%
wave height more than 100 F feet using
 
00:28:00.789 --> 00:28:00.799 align:start position:0%
the techniques that they're using and
 
00:28:03.950 --> 00:28:03.960 align:start position:0%
it's been it's been repudiated by
 
00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:05.029 align:start position:0%
it's been it's been repudiated by
numerous

00:28:05.029 --> 00:28:05.039 align:start position:0%
numerous
 
00:28:07.909 --> 00:28:07.919 align:start position:0%
experts like my colleagues have said 300
 
00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:11.640 align:start position:0%
fet is a meaningful setback it is um
 
00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:14.480 align:start position:0%
it's recognized by voters it is
 
00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
consistent with our neighboring state
 
00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
for those for those folks that both boat
 
00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:21.760 align:start position:0%
in multiple states it is recog it's
 
00:28:25.269 --> 00:28:25.279 align:start position:0%
already trained um by to Department of
 
00:28:28.269 --> 00:28:28.279 align:start position:0%
uh safety in terms of recognizing the
 
00:28:29.950 --> 00:28:29.960 align:start position:0%
300 foot setback because of the ski
 
00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:32.720 align:start position:0%
craft regulations and the fact the
 
00:28:35.669 --> 00:28:35.679 align:start position:0%
reality is is most boers cannot
 
00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:39.640 align:start position:0%
determine distinguish 200 foot off U
 
00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:42.640 align:start position:0%
distance versus 150 foot distance on an
 
00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:44.960 align:start position:0%
open body water that's a very difficult
 
00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
to do on an open body water so what's
 
00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:49.320 align:start position:0%
going to happen is this bill will act
 
00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:51.200 align:start position:0%
without the amendment will have zero
 
00:28:54.750 --> 00:28:54.760 align:start position:0%
impact and there thereby it's worse than
 
00:28:56.389 --> 00:28:56.399 align:start position:0%
passing without the amendment it's worse
 
00:28:58.870 --> 00:28:58.880 align:start position:0%
than passing nothing because we're
 
00:29:00.310 --> 00:29:00.320 align:start position:0%
acting like we're doing something but
 
00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:02.240 align:start position:0%
voters won't be able to act on
 
00:29:05.389 --> 00:29:05.399 align:start position:0%
it Department of Environmental Services
 
00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
um at my request conducted an analysis
 
00:29:11.549 --> 00:29:11.559 align:start position:0%
of the lakes in New Hampshire um that
 
00:29:15.389 --> 00:29:15.399 align:start position:0%
where wake surfing would be uh permitted
 
00:29:17.549 --> 00:29:17.559 align:start position:0%
um with a 200 foot setback and a 50 foot
 
00:29:20.269 --> 00:29:20.279 align:start position:0%
acre minimum uh a 50 acre minimum and a
 
00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:22.720 align:start position:0%
300 foot setback and a 50 acre minimum
 
00:29:25.029 --> 00:29:25.039 align:start position:0%
you'll see those are um if you're
 
00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:27.480 align:start position:0%
interested they're in the bottom of this
 
00:29:29.310 --> 00:29:29.320 align:start position:0%
paper I as though you'll see that
 
00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:32.320 align:start position:0%
there's only five Lake difference for
 
00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:36.360 align:start position:0%
those lakes that um do not have um
 
00:29:38.669 --> 00:29:38.679 align:start position:0%
horsepower or speed limit or wake
 
00:29:42.269 --> 00:29:42.279 align:start position:0%
restrictions of those five four of them
 
00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:45.080 align:start position:0%
actually have less than two acres um
 
00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:48.880 align:start position:0%
with a uh with a wake surfing area with
 
00:29:50.389 --> 00:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
a 200 foot setback and one of them
 
00:29:53.269 --> 00:29:53.279 align:start position:0%
doesn't have an adequate boat launch um
 
00:29:55.789 --> 00:29:55.799 align:start position:0%
you'll see that um of the average
 
00:29:58.710 --> 00:29:58.720 align:start position:0%
operational size with a 300t setback is
 
00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:02.840 align:start position:0%
259 Acres 259 Acres which is larger than
 
00:30:05.029 --> 00:30:05.039 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of of public water on
 
00:30:07.950 --> 00:30:07.960 align:start position:0%
this on this Lake if you're
 
00:30:11.269 --> 00:30:11.279 align:start position:0%
interested I have um with the help of
 
00:30:13.549 --> 00:30:13.559 align:start position:0%
the lake stied production Association
 
00:30:17.230 --> 00:30:17.240 align:start position:0%
charted out the 300t offset on a number
 
00:30:18.990 --> 00:30:19.000 align:start position:0%
of different lakes throughout the state
 
00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:21.200 align:start position:0%
these are lakes that were brought up in
 
00:30:23.950 --> 00:30:23.960 align:start position:0%
testimony both on Senate Bill 431 and
 
00:30:26.509 --> 00:30:26.519 align:start position:0%
Senate and House Bill 1390 where people
 
00:30:28.350 --> 00:30:28.360 align:start position:0%
are actually we surfing with they want
 
00:30:32.909 --> 00:30:32.919 align:start position:0%
to wake surf um and you'll see that the
 
00:30:35.470 --> 00:30:35.480 align:start position:0%
the dark blue line indicates the area
 
00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:37.120 align:start position:0%
that would be restricted from wake
 
00:30:39.950 --> 00:30:39.960 align:start position:0%
surfing that tiny dark blue line you can
 
00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:42.840 align:start position:0%
also see the very large space that it
 
00:30:45.669 --> 00:30:45.679 align:start position:0%
where wake surfing is still
 
00:30:48.590 --> 00:30:48.600 align:start position:0%
permitted I've put the um with again
 
00:30:51.310 --> 00:30:51.320 align:start position:0%
with the um Department of Environmental
 
00:30:54.509 --> 00:30:54.519 align:start position:0%
Services um support I've put the a the
 
00:30:56.629 --> 00:30:56.639 align:start position:0%
acreage that would be available on these
 
00:30:59.110 --> 00:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
Lakes of various sizes
 
00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:02.080 align:start position:0%
um and you can see that even Lake mum
 
00:31:04.669 --> 00:31:04.679 align:start position:0%
has 237
 
00:31:07.549 --> 00:31:07.559 align:start position:0%
Acres I am a member of the public water
 
00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:09.440 align:start position:0%
access Advisory Board and I take that
 
00:31:11.470 --> 00:31:11.480 align:start position:0%
responsibility to provide access to
 
00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:13.720 align:start position:0%
public Waters in New Hampshire
 
00:31:17.509 --> 00:31:17.519 align:start position:0%
seriously I also cherish um our
 
00:31:20.029 --> 00:31:20.039 align:start position:0%
beautiful iconic lates and I would urge
 
00:31:24.629 --> 00:31:24.639 align:start position:0%
you to vote Yes on uh Amendment 1598 to
 
00:31:26.509 --> 00:31:26.519 align:start position:0%
protect the Lakes thank
 
00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:29.440 align:start position:0%
you anyone else else wish to speak on
 
00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:36.950 align:start position:0%
you anyone else else wish to speak on
the

00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:39.549 --> 00:31:39.559 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you Mr
 
00:31:42.789 --> 00:31:42.799 align:start position:0%
chair I feel it's important to give um
 
00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
the opposite side of this
 
00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:49.360 align:start position:0%
debate I also read all the reports and
 
00:31:52.590 --> 00:31:52.600 align:start position:0%
um I'm still uh be Twix with the
 
00:31:55.509 --> 00:31:55.519 align:start position:0%
comments and the reports that talk about
 
00:32:01.950 --> 00:32:01.960 align:start position:0%
real Shoreland uh harm done by wind ice
 
00:32:04.430 --> 00:32:04.440 align:start position:0%
weather as compared
 
00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:08.360 align:start position:0%
to moving the line 300 ft
 
00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:11.480 align:start position:0%
out I give Credence that there's other
 
00:32:14.669 --> 00:32:14.679 align:start position:0%
factors that hurt the shore the other
 
00:32:16.789 --> 00:32:16.799 align:start position:0%
elephant in the room that some people
 
00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
did mention earlier so I'll bring it up
 
00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
is although it may be an incremental
 
00:32:23.909 --> 00:32:23.919 align:start position:0%
small incremental increase to go from
 
00:32:27.269 --> 00:32:27.279 align:start position:0%
150 to 200 it's an increase when I look
 
00:32:29.629 --> 00:32:29.639 align:start position:0%
at bills and I look at the Senate the
 
00:32:33.710 --> 00:32:33.720 align:start position:0%
house and the governor I try to say what
 
00:32:36.350 --> 00:32:36.360 align:start position:0%
can we do with baby steps to get things
 
00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:39.200 align:start position:0%
passed I am not confident that this
 
00:32:42.149 --> 00:32:42.159 align:start position:0%
Amendment added on to this bill will do
 
00:32:45.029 --> 00:32:45.039 align:start position:0%
anything to help this bill pass all the
 
00:32:47.870 --> 00:32:47.880 align:start position:0%
house and the Senate and the governor so
 
00:32:49.870 --> 00:32:49.880 align:start position:0%
I I'm always of the opinion I'd rather
 
00:32:52.830 --> 00:32:52.840 align:start position:0%
take a baby step to do some help than to
 
00:32:55.549 --> 00:32:55.559 align:start position:0%
pass something that may not have
 
00:32:58.509 --> 00:32:58.519 align:start position:0%
likelihood of full Passage so I'm going
 
00:33:00.789 --> 00:33:00.799 align:start position:0%
to vote against the amendment uh I
 
00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
support the Marine trades that say 200
 
00:33:05.509 --> 00:33:05.519 align:start position:0%
feet and there's nothing that prohibits
 
00:33:07.990 --> 00:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
us at another uh session to come back
 
00:33:12.149 --> 00:33:12.159 align:start position:0%
and increase it if we need to but uh on
 
00:33:14.269 --> 00:33:14.279 align:start position:0%
practicality I I'm going to support
 
00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:16.240 align:start position:0%
something that I think will pass
 
00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:18.880 align:start position:0%
everyone thank you Mr
 
00:33:22.549 --> 00:33:22.559 align:start position:0%
chair representative har Harvey bu
 
00:33:24.430 --> 00:33:24.440 align:start position:0%
representative harb said it um what I
 
00:33:26.149 --> 00:33:26.159 align:start position:0%
was going to say
 
00:33:28.269 --> 00:33:28.279 align:start position:0%
thanks any of
 
00:33:32.029 --> 00:33:32.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
time well thank you for offering me the
 
00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity wait a minute wait a minute
 
00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:40.440 align:start position:0%
she actually beat you you got to raise
 
00:33:44.629 --> 00:33:44.639 align:start position:0%
your hand and and you and how's the
 
00:33:47.549 --> 00:33:47.559 align:start position:0%
Water by the way I don't have a bar of
 
00:33:49.789 --> 00:33:49.799 align:start position:0%
soap so I'm would you like would you
 
00:33:53.710 --> 00:33:53.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:56.509 --> 00:33:56.519 align:start position:0%
you turn off your mic representative
 
00:33:56.519 --> 00:33:58.350 align:start position:0%
you turn off your mic representative
will

00:33:58.350 --> 00:33:58.360 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:34:01.710 --> 00:34:01.720 align:start position:0%
well I will say again that passing it at
 
00:34:04.509 --> 00:34:04.519 align:start position:0%
two 200 feet is not a baby step because
 
00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
it basically does nothing but with
 
00:34:10.230 --> 00:34:10.240 align:start position:0%
regard to comparing the waves from the
 
00:34:13.349 --> 00:34:13.359 align:start position:0%
Wake boats to the naturally occurring
 
00:34:15.589 --> 00:34:15.599 align:start position:0%
storms there's a really big difference
 
00:34:17.149 --> 00:34:17.159 align:start position:0%
we can do nothing about the storms
 
00:34:20.589 --> 00:34:20.599 align:start position:0%
coming but they don't happen all summer
 
00:34:23.909 --> 00:34:23.919 align:start position:0%
long all day long in every
 
00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:26.240 align:start position:0%
direction the Wake
 
00:34:29.349 --> 00:34:29.359 align:start position:0%
boats their way waves they may say oh
 
00:34:31.950 --> 00:34:31.960 align:start position:0%
we're going to try to direct our wakes
 
00:34:34.030 --> 00:34:34.040 align:start position:0%
away from the shore but that's almost
 
00:34:36.430 --> 00:34:36.440 align:start position:0%
impossible are they only going in One
 
00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
Direction no they have to turn around
 
00:34:41.310 --> 00:34:41.320 align:start position:0%
multiple times so the
 
00:34:44.950 --> 00:34:44.960 align:start position:0%
loons that would naturally nest and
 
00:34:47.230 --> 00:34:47.240 align:start position:0%
areas that are sheltered from the
 
00:34:50.389 --> 00:34:50.399 align:start position:0%
prevailing wind have no protection when
 
00:34:54.069 --> 00:34:54.079 align:start position:0%
you have these wake waves coming in all
 
00:34:57.870 --> 00:34:57.880 align:start position:0%
directions every day all summer long so
 
00:35:00.390 --> 00:35:00.400 align:start position:0%
we do need to do something about the
 
00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
things that we can control to protect
 
00:35:06.190 --> 00:35:06.200 align:start position:0%
the Leakes and 200 ft is we might as
 
00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
well do nothing so I don't know why we
 
00:35:09.790 --> 00:35:09.800 align:start position:0%
would fight for that as if it's an
 
00:35:13.069 --> 00:35:13.079 align:start position:0%
accomplishment when it's not so I'm
 
00:35:15.470 --> 00:35:15.480 align:start position:0%
going to vote for the
 
00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
amendment representative wolf then rep
 
00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:20.310 align:start position:0%
amendment representative wolf then rep
representative

00:35:20.310 --> 00:35:20.320 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:35:23.470 --> 00:35:23.480 align:start position:0%
Donley thank you Mr
 
00:35:27.790 --> 00:35:27.800 align:start position:0%
chairman I guess I'm more concerned
 
00:35:29.310 --> 00:35:29.320 align:start position:0%
about the
 
00:35:31.990 --> 00:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
future and really concerned about the
 
00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
future I've seen what's
 
00:35:38.109 --> 00:35:38.119 align:start position:0%
happened 15 or 18 years ago when a golf
 
00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
course was being
 
00:35:42.109 --> 00:35:42.119 align:start position:0%
built and the erosion control didn't
 
00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:44.200 align:start position:0%
work and my daughter came out of the
 
00:35:48.190 --> 00:35:48.200 align:start position:0%
lake sunp covered in brown mud it was on
 
00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:49.960 align:start position:0%
channel 9 and it was on front page of
 
00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:51.030 align:start position:0%
channel 9 and it was on front page of
the

00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:35:54.270 --> 00:35:54.280 align:start position:0%
newspapers so I have to look at the
 
00:35:57.109 --> 00:35:57.119 align:start position:0%
environment and at the same time I don't
 
00:36:00.069 --> 00:36:00.079 align:start position:0%
want to affect anybody's livelihood I
 
00:36:02.270 --> 00:36:02.280 align:start position:0%
have a lot of friends who have wake
 
00:36:05.109 --> 00:36:05.119 align:start position:0%
boats and I'm not going to ban them and
 
00:36:07.390 --> 00:36:07.400 align:start position:0%
I don't think I am going to affect the
 
00:36:11.069 --> 00:36:11.079 align:start position:0%
sales of the Marine trades Association
 
00:36:14.390 --> 00:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
because they're calling it a ban this is
 
00:36:17.589 --> 00:36:17.599 align:start position:0%
not a ban this is in everybody's
 
00:36:21.710 --> 00:36:21.720 align:start position:0%
interest to protect the future so that
 
00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
they can sell more boats so that we can
 
00:36:27.270 --> 00:36:27.280 align:start position:0%
go out on the lakes and I think it's
 
00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:28.430 align:start position:0%
go out on the lakes and I think it's
time

00:36:28.430 --> 00:36:28.440 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:36:31.630 --> 00:36:31.640 align:start position:0%
that we didn't chase the almighty dollar
 
00:36:35.950 --> 00:36:35.960 align:start position:0%
and looked to what the environment calls
 
00:36:38.309 --> 00:36:38.319 align:start position:0%
for representative
 
00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
Donnelly thank you Mr chair um so I have
 
00:36:44.309 --> 00:36:44.319 align:start position:0%
many constituents as well who would like
 
00:36:48.190 --> 00:36:48.200 align:start position:0%
to see something uh changed and um based
 
00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:50.280 align:start position:0%
on what I've heard um and talking to
 
00:36:54.309 --> 00:36:54.319 align:start position:0%
colleagues across the Senate the house
 
00:36:58.670 --> 00:36:58.680 align:start position:0%
um the 200 set back will work I believe
 
00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:00.880 align:start position:0%
that this is an education issue as much
 
00:37:03.589 --> 00:37:03.599 align:start position:0%
as we want to pass bills um I live on a
 
00:37:05.349 --> 00:37:05.359 align:start position:0%
lake the last thing I want to do is
 
00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
create contention amongst Our Lake
 
00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
friends and by just passing bills
 
00:37:13.309 --> 00:37:13.319 align:start position:0%
without any education to them and
 
00:37:16.390 --> 00:37:16.400 align:start position:0%
without any Marine Patrol to help guide
 
00:37:21.309 --> 00:37:21.319 align:start position:0%
this we're by doing the 300 foot rule
 
00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
you're creating a problem where it's not
 
00:37:25.309 --> 00:37:25.319 align:start position:0%
going to actually
 
00:37:28.150 --> 00:37:28.160 align:start position:0%
pass in the long run but if we we do the
 
00:37:30.270 --> 00:37:30.280 align:start position:0%
200 foot we have people saying they're
 
00:37:32.109 --> 00:37:32.119 align:start position:0%
willing to do more education they're
 
00:37:33.550 --> 00:37:33.560 align:start position:0%
willing to put more information out
 
00:37:36.109 --> 00:37:36.119 align:start position:0%
there for everyone who has a wake
 
00:37:39.829 --> 00:37:39.839 align:start position:0%
Bol wouldn't we want to pass something
 
00:37:42.270 --> 00:37:42.280 align:start position:0%
that actually brings about more
 
00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:51.550 --> 00:37:51.560 align:start position:0%
legislation rep
 
00:37:54.270 --> 00:37:54.280 align:start position:0%
representative uh you've spoken um
 
00:37:57.710 --> 00:37:57.720 align:start position:0%
already oh representative rung has not
 
00:38:01.390 --> 00:38:01.400 align:start position:0%
spoken then recognize representative
 
00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:02.800 align:start position:0%
after representative rung then
 
00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:06.560 align:start position:0%
representative Vale thank you Mr chair
 
00:38:09.710 --> 00:38:09.720 align:start position:0%
although with this bill I'm glad to see
 
00:38:11.870 --> 00:38:11.880 align:start position:0%
the distance from Shore and wake boats
 
00:38:14.470 --> 00:38:14.480 align:start position:0%
the impact wake boats have being brought
 
00:38:18.109 --> 00:38:18.119 align:start position:0%
to our attention but this is an issue
 
00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:22.680 align:start position:0%
that as a scientist that we I I feel we
 
00:38:25.870 --> 00:38:25.880 align:start position:0%
need to respect the science and the
 
00:38:28.470 --> 00:38:28.480 align:start position:0%
science says 200 is not protective it's
 
00:38:29.870 --> 00:38:29.880 align:start position:0%
not going to make a
 
00:38:32.349 --> 00:38:32.359 align:start position:0%
difference I respect representative
 
00:38:34.950 --> 00:38:34.960 align:start position:0%
harb's comments but I think doing
 
00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
something just for political expediency
 
00:38:39.870 --> 00:38:39.880 align:start position:0%
um when it flies in the face of sound
 
00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:42.640 align:start position:0%
science is not what we should be doing I
 
00:38:46.069 --> 00:38:46.079 align:start position:0%
don't think that I can look my
 
00:38:49.309 --> 00:38:49.319 align:start position:0%
constituents on babus lake in the face
 
00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:52.400 align:start position:0%
um or my neighbors up at Lake kosaka in
 
00:38:55.190 --> 00:38:55.200 align:start position:0%
the face by saying oh we passed a bill
 
00:38:56.910 --> 00:38:56.920 align:start position:0%
that increases it to 200 because it's
 
00:38:59.069 --> 00:38:59.079 align:start position:0%
not going to do anything and I I feel
 
00:39:00.510 --> 00:39:00.520 align:start position:0%
like we're really
 
00:39:03.630 --> 00:39:03.640 align:start position:0%
disrespecting um
 
00:39:06.910 --> 00:39:06.920 align:start position:0%
valid Foundation valid facts that we
 
00:39:08.550 --> 00:39:08.560 align:start position:0%
should be using to drive our
 
00:39:11.829 --> 00:39:11.839 align:start position:0%
decisionmaking not being driven by what
 
00:39:14.109 --> 00:39:14.119 align:start position:0%
may pass or what the governor may do I
 
00:39:16.270 --> 00:39:16.280 align:start position:0%
think we have to defend what's right and
 
00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:19.200 align:start position:0%
what's scientifically valid and if that
 
00:39:21.390 --> 00:39:21.400 align:start position:0%
takes more political courage than
 
00:39:23.190 --> 00:39:23.200 align:start position:0%
letting something easily pass and I
 
00:39:25.390 --> 00:39:25.400 align:start position:0%
think we need to do that thank
 
00:39:29.470 --> 00:39:29.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:31.309 --> 00:39:31.319 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:39:35.069 --> 00:39:35.079 align:start position:0%
um so as I said before we spent a lot of
 
00:39:38.190 --> 00:39:38.200 align:start position:0%
time on this issue and I just think that
 
00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:40.480 align:start position:0%
if we were to pass this bill as it is
 
00:39:43.430 --> 00:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
without the amendment that we wouldn't
 
00:39:46.190 --> 00:39:46.200 align:start position:0%
be doing what we should be doing as a
 
00:39:49.390 --> 00:39:49.400 align:start position:0%
committee um and I also want to say that
 
00:39:52.470 --> 00:39:52.480 align:start position:0%
you know we are the legislature we are
 
00:39:55.870 --> 00:39:55.880 align:start position:0%
not living with the people who are in
 
00:39:58.550 --> 00:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
this conflict every day I know that some
 
00:40:00.870 --> 00:40:00.880 align:start position:0%
of the members of this committee have a
 
00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
lake life and they understand the direct
 
00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:06.160 align:start position:0%
impacts because they're being directly
 
00:40:08.990 --> 00:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
impacted and some of people you know
 
00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:12.720 align:start position:0%
have the opposite position as well but
 
00:40:15.630 --> 00:40:15.640 align:start position:0%
we come in here to hear bills and to
 
00:40:18.069 --> 00:40:18.079 align:start position:0%
listen to the laws as they are written
 
00:40:19.470 --> 00:40:19.480 align:start position:0%
and figure out how they should be
 
00:40:21.950 --> 00:40:21.960 align:start position:0%
changed and brought forward we're not
 
00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:24.720 align:start position:0%
here to make a decision that everybody's
 
00:40:26.870 --> 00:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
going to go away and say this bill is
 
00:40:29.069 --> 00:40:29.079 align:start position:0%
what we want wanted and we're going to
 
00:40:31.589 --> 00:40:31.599 align:start position:0%
rest with this bill we don't want that
 
00:40:34.990 --> 00:40:35.000 align:start position:0%
rest necessarily this is really is not
 
00:40:37.750 --> 00:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
progress for our committee and it is
 
00:40:40.790 --> 00:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
really not our job to make
 
00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:44.560 align:start position:0%
decisions that have ramifications that
 
00:40:49.710 --> 00:40:49.720 align:start position:0%
really don't benefit the situation thank
 
00:40:53.069 --> 00:40:53.079 align:start position:0%
you anyone else wish to speak on the mo
 
00:40:56.230 --> 00:40:56.240 align:start position:0%
on the motion on the on the amendment
 
00:40:58.510 --> 00:40:58.520 align:start position:0%
representative mq thank you Mr chairman
 
00:41:01.750 --> 00:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
just a couple quick comments um I think
 
00:41:03.309 --> 00:41:03.319 align:start position:0%
we need to show the courage to
 
00:41:06.270 --> 00:41:06.280 align:start position:0%
collaborate with the other body and act
 
00:41:09.670 --> 00:41:09.680 align:start position:0%
on this bill and promote a
 
00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
responsible wake wake responsible
 
00:41:16.109 --> 00:41:16.119 align:start position:0%
program that's won awards nationally we
 
00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
need to get something done instead of
 
00:41:21.829 --> 00:41:21.839 align:start position:0%
arguing over 30 yards we all have
 
00:41:24.470 --> 00:41:24.480 align:start position:0%
opinions on exactly which science is the
 
00:41:27.750 --> 00:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
best which distance is the best
 
00:41:29.950 --> 00:41:29.960 align:start position:0%
and I don't want us to face the reality
 
00:41:34.950 --> 00:41:34.960 align:start position:0%
that we've done nothing to satisfy all
 
00:41:37.829 --> 00:41:37.839 align:start position:0%
of the pleas as we head into the summer
 
00:41:40.790 --> 00:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
season from the folks who are fortunate
 
00:41:42.430 --> 00:41:42.440 align:start position:0%
enough to live on lakes and have a lake
 
00:41:44.589 --> 00:41:44.599 align:start position:0%
life or a lake house and those who are
 
00:41:47.190 --> 00:41:47.200 align:start position:0%
fortunate enough to have wake craft and
 
00:41:50.910 --> 00:41:50.920 align:start position:0%
wake boats we've got to act now and not
 
00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:53.160 align:start position:0%
risk the death of this important
 
00:41:55.270 --> 00:41:55.280 align:start position:0%
legislation we've heard from hundreds
 
00:41:58.349 --> 00:41:58.359 align:start position:0%
and hundreds of wake boat owners on both
 
00:42:01.470 --> 00:42:01.480 align:start position:0%
sides that have made imp passion pleased
 
00:42:03.470 --> 00:42:03.480 align:start position:0%
to make something happen we had two
 
00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
other bills that both wound up on the
 
00:42:08.750 --> 00:42:08.760 align:start position:0%
table for whatever reason and I agree
 
00:42:11.870 --> 00:42:11.880 align:start position:0%
they didn't get debated by the full body
 
00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
properly but they did get debated
 
00:42:16.069 --> 00:42:16.079 align:start position:0%
repeatedly they're being debated again
 
00:42:18.190 --> 00:42:18.200 align:start position:0%
here we had hearings in rep's Halls we
 
00:42:20.589 --> 00:42:20.599 align:start position:0%
had numerous hearings here as a full
 
00:42:22.309 --> 00:42:22.319 align:start position:0%
committee as uh I don't recall whether
 
00:42:23.829 --> 00:42:23.839 align:start position:0%
we had a subcommittee but we've had
 
00:42:26.109 --> 00:42:26.119 align:start position:0%
numerous sessions here here's an
 
00:42:28.309 --> 00:42:28.319 align:start position:0%
opportunity for us to collaborate
 
00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:32.640 align:start position:0%
amongst ourselves and put 30 yards and
 
00:42:37.150 --> 00:42:37.160 align:start position:0%
see what happens for the first year and
 
00:42:39.630 --> 00:42:39.640 align:start position:0%
and and put it on the books that this
 
00:42:42.349 --> 00:42:42.359 align:start position:0%
committee this house and this and the
 
00:42:45.589 --> 00:42:45.599 align:start position:0%
full legislative General Court wants to
 
00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
promote responsible wake surfing and if
 
00:42:51.390 --> 00:42:51.400 align:start position:0%
200 F feet isn't enough maybe it does
 
00:42:54.990 --> 00:42:55.000 align:start position:0%
need to be 300 ft next next session and
 
00:42:57.270 --> 00:42:57.280 align:start position:0%
that can change and we can collect that
 
00:42:59.510 --> 00:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
data and we can come back and say see it
 
00:43:02.190 --> 00:43:02.200 align:start position:0%
didn't make a difference and I'm willing
 
00:43:04.349 --> 00:43:04.359 align:start position:0%
to accept that perhaps after a Year's
 
00:43:06.430 --> 00:43:06.440 align:start position:0%
worth of data it
 
00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:10.480 align:start position:0%
didn't that's possible I'm conflicted on
 
00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
the science there's a science on both
 
00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:15.720 align:start position:0%
sides for sure I think some of it is
 
00:43:18.430 --> 00:43:18.440 align:start position:0%
pretty good some of it is you know
 
00:43:19.910 --> 00:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
everybody has an opinion on it I I think
 
00:43:21.750 --> 00:43:21.760 align:start position:0%
every study can be looked at from a
 
00:43:24.990 --> 00:43:25.000 align:start position:0%
variety of reasons um but I hate to
 
00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:28.200 align:start position:0%
single out one type type of activity or
 
00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:31.200 align:start position:0%
one type of vote when we are so close to
 
00:43:33.230 --> 00:43:33.240 align:start position:0%
passing something and the other
 
00:43:35.069 --> 00:43:35.079 align:start position:0%
representatives from my district have
 
00:43:38.270 --> 00:43:38.280 align:start position:0%
heard it from those Lakes big and small
 
00:43:40.750 --> 00:43:40.760 align:start position:0%
I I'm concerned that we will be
 
00:43:43.190 --> 00:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
effectively Banning by implementing this
 
00:43:45.510 --> 00:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
buffer which is what it is it's a buffer
 
00:43:48.270 --> 00:43:48.280 align:start position:0%
not a b which is a good thing so I urge
 
00:43:52.670 --> 00:43:52.680 align:start position:0%
the committee to take what may be 2/3 of
 
00:43:55.910 --> 00:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
a loaf and 30 yards short of of what
 
00:43:57.710 --> 00:43:57.720 align:start position:0%
some perceive as the the ultimate goal
 
00:44:01.190 --> 00:44:01.200 align:start position:0%
line let's take this as a good way to
 
00:44:04.190 --> 00:44:04.200 align:start position:0%
lead a good way to collaborate and wake
 
00:44:06.349 --> 00:44:06.359 align:start position:0%
responsibly and we might have to add
 
00:44:10.030 --> 00:44:10.040 align:start position:0%
another 30 yards in 12 months time or
 
00:44:12.589 --> 00:44:12.599 align:start position:0%
you know what could be a short period of
 
00:44:15.430 --> 00:44:15.440 align:start position:0%
time after we have some more data let's
 
00:44:17.150 --> 00:44:17.160 align:start position:0%
let's take
 
00:44:20.430 --> 00:44:20.440 align:start position:0%
it anyone else wish to speak on the on
 
00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:23.390 align:start position:0%
it anyone else wish to speak on the on
the

00:44:23.390 --> 00:44:23.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:31.030 --> 00:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
been in this business now for the last
 
00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:32.270 align:start position:0%
been in this business now for the last
18

00:44:32.270 --> 00:44:32.280 align:start position:0%
18
 
00:44:36.390 --> 00:44:36.400 align:start position:0%
years and one of the
 
00:44:40.190 --> 00:44:40.200 align:start position:0%
Prime thing things I've seen over the
 
00:44:43.829 --> 00:44:43.839 align:start position:0%
years is what a very useful technique
 
00:44:45.829 --> 00:44:45.839 align:start position:0%
was called a salami technique where you
 
00:44:50.309 --> 00:44:50.319 align:start position:0%
take a take what you can get take the
 
00:44:54.670 --> 00:44:54.680 align:start position:0%
win rather than continue to to up your
 
00:44:58.630 --> 00:44:58.640 align:start position:0%
bet and eventually take a loss Lo all
 
00:45:03.829 --> 00:45:03.839 align:start position:0%
right now this this amendment will give
 
00:45:06.430 --> 00:45:06.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:09.390 --> 00:45:09.400 align:start position:0%
loss bill on the bill that we're
 
00:45:12.990 --> 00:45:13.000 align:start position:0%
debating gives you a win it's not the
 
00:45:15.549 --> 00:45:15.559 align:start position:0%
big win but it's a
 
00:45:17.589 --> 00:45:17.599 align:start position:0%
win and that's
 
00:45:20.109 --> 00:45:20.119 align:start position:0%
psychology so that the winning
 
00:45:22.750 --> 00:45:22.760 align:start position:0%
psychology you will move be able to move
 
00:45:25.150 --> 00:45:25.160 align:start position:0%
get the rest of the salami if you use
 
00:45:27.470 --> 00:45:27.480 align:start position:0%
the salami technique but that's what
 
00:45:30.510 --> 00:45:30.520 align:start position:0%
in front of you the the Senate is not
 
00:45:33.230 --> 00:45:33.240 align:start position:0%
going to be not going to back down on
 
00:45:35.790 --> 00:45:35.800 align:start position:0%
this and I don't and knowing the
 
00:45:37.670 --> 00:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
governor I doubt very much that he will
 
00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:39.630 align:start position:0%
governor I doubt very much that he will
either

00:45:39.630 --> 00:45:39.640 align:start position:0%
either
 
00:45:42.470 --> 00:45:42.480 align:start position:0%
so yes you'll get you'll feel really
 
00:45:46.030 --> 00:45:46.040 align:start position:0%
good and you can tell people I voted for
 
00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:48.589 align:start position:0%
good and you can tell people I voted for
300

00:45:48.589 --> 00:45:48.599 align:start position:0%
300
 
00:45:52.390 --> 00:45:52.400 align:start position:0%
ft and what happened you
 
00:45:57.470 --> 00:45:57.480 align:start position:0%
lost or you can go 200 ft take the off
 
00:46:00.950 --> 00:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
ER come back next year with the next
 
00:46:02.990 --> 00:46:03.000 align:start position:0%
with the next for the next piece of
 
00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.109 align:start position:0%
with the next for the next piece of
salami

00:46:05.109 --> 00:46:05.119 align:start position:0%
salami
 
00:46:09.430 --> 00:46:09.440 align:start position:0%
anyway that's all I got to say any uh
 
00:46:12.230 --> 00:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to speak on the on the
 
00:46:13.950 --> 00:46:13.960 align:start position:0%

presume uh as your representative mchu
