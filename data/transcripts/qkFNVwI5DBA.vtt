microphone edit etiquette in this
 
00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.390 align:start position:0%
microphone edit etiquette in this
committee

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 align:start position:0%

i urge you to turn your microphone on
 
00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 align:start position:0%
once you have completed speaking i ask
 
00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 align:start position:0%
that you turn your microphone off
 
00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:21.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 align:start position:0%
before we get started with our executive
 
00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:25.199 align:start position:0%
sessions i want to address an issue that
 
00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960 align:start position:0%
some people have expressed some concern
 
00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:27.830 align:start position:0%
some people have expressed some concern
about

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
on january 7th
 
00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 align:start position:0%
the stne committee tabled
 
00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
several bills that were pending before
 
00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:46.479 align:start position:0%
now some people have suggested that
 
00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
we're trying to stifle debate
 
00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:50.800 align:start position:0%
and i want to
 
00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
put that suggestion to bed it is not
 
00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
true we're not trying to stifle debate
 
00:05:59.510 --> 00:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
as you all well know
 
00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:02.080 align:start position:0%
st e bills tend to come up late in the
 
00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:04.560 align:start position:0%
day because of where we
 
00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:08.240 align:start position:0%
reside in the calendar alphabet
 
00:06:10.309 --> 00:06:10.319 align:start position:0%
and leadership approached me on both
 
00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:11.840 align:start position:0%
those days
 
00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
and requested that i tabled those bills
 
00:06:18.309 --> 00:06:18.319 align:start position:0%
in order to allow the sessions to end in
 
00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:21.440 align:start position:0%
a timely fashion
 
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.800 align:start position:0%
both those
 
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
session days
 
00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
the debates that had been scheduled
 
00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:30.800 align:start position:0%
would have lasted a minimum of an hour
 
00:06:33.189 --> 00:06:33.199 align:start position:0%
and we were nearing the end of our
 
00:06:35.749 --> 00:06:35.759 align:start position:0%
session time
 
00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:38.800 align:start position:0%
and so the leadership team asked me to
 
00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
to table those bills which i did
 
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
reluctantly i didn't want to i wanted
 
00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
the debates to happen but
 
00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
in the interest of time i decided that
 
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
was the prudent course of action
 
00:06:55.189 --> 00:06:55.199 align:start position:0%
so i wanted to clear the air about that
 
00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:57.440 align:start position:0%
let everybody know that we're not trying
 
00:06:59.670 --> 00:06:59.680 align:start position:0%
to stifle debate
 
00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
i see a couple of members would like to
 
00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:04.240 align:start position:0%
respond representative pimentel
 
00:07:06.469 --> 00:07:06.479 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman so
 
00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
i understand that and it makes perfect
 
00:07:11.589 --> 00:07:11.599 align:start position:0%
sense and i'm just wondering if
 
00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:12.880 align:start position:0%
now that we're going to be in
 
00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:15.680 align:start position:0%
legislative hall if that is
 
00:07:18.629 --> 00:07:18.639 align:start position:0%
less likely to happen
 
00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:20.560 align:start position:0%
i could not predict what what will
 
00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
happen once we get back into reps hall
 
00:07:24.469 --> 00:07:24.479 align:start position:0%
but the hope is
 
00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:27.360 align:start position:0%
that our session life will return more
 
00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:30.400 align:start position:0%
to normal going forward and so that
 
00:07:32.309 --> 00:07:32.319 align:start position:0%
being the case we would hope we wouldn't
 
00:07:34.629 --> 00:07:34.639 align:start position:0%
have to do that too often going forward
 
00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
representative mann
 
00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:43.280 align:start position:0%
given that it takes a
 
00:07:45.909 --> 00:07:45.919 align:start position:0%
substantial vote to take those two bills
 
00:07:47.909 --> 00:07:47.919 align:start position:0%
off the table
 
00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:50.720 align:start position:0%
are we going to get cooperation from the
 
00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:53.440 align:start position:0%
republican party in taking these off the
 
00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:56.230 align:start position:0%
republican party in taking these off the
table

00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
once again i can't predict what will
 
00:08:00.469 --> 00:08:00.479 align:start position:0%
happen in the future
 
00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
i will say that if there is time to take
 
00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
bills off the table so that they can be
 
00:08:07.749 --> 00:08:07.759 align:start position:0%
debated that could happen but i can't
 
00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
predict it one way or the other
 
00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
ah thank you for your question though
 
00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:15.120 align:start position:0%
did you have a follow-up yes follow-up
 
00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
if the situation ever comes up
 
00:08:23.909 --> 00:08:23.919 align:start position:0%
where it's possible
 
00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:25.840 align:start position:0%
to have some time to take those two
 
00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:28.400 align:start position:0%
bills off the table would we
 
00:08:32.389 --> 00:08:32.399 align:start position:0%
be um would it be possible to be for the
 
00:08:32.399 --> 00:08:34.550 align:start position:0%
be um would it be possible to be for the
republican

00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
republican
 
00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:37.919 align:start position:0%
delegation to uh
 
00:08:40.469 --> 00:08:40.479 align:start position:0%
assert that they will in fact support
 
00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:43.200 align:start position:0%
taking it off the table since it was
 
00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
only done for a
 
00:08:48.389 --> 00:08:48.399 align:start position:0%
reason unrelated to the
 
00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:50.240 align:start position:0%
bill itself
 
00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:54.640 align:start position:0%
the bills we can discuss excuse me
 
00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
we can discuss that with our caucus i
 
00:08:58.389 --> 00:08:58.399 align:start position:0%
can't predict what the outcome will be
 
00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:00.160 align:start position:0%
of that discussion
 
00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:01.670 align:start position:0%
of that discussion
um

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:04.320 align:start position:0%
somebody else had a question
 
00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:06.240 align:start position:0%
oh representative notter
 
00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:07.760 align:start position:0%

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:27.910 align:start position:0%
asking uh uh
sheriff

00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
sheriff
 
00:09:29.829 --> 00:09:29.839 align:start position:0%
asking to address your institutional
 
00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
memory are these bills ever taken out of
 
00:09:34.949 --> 00:09:34.959 align:start position:0%
their alphabetical order
 
00:09:37.509 --> 00:09:37.519 align:start position:0%
or are we always going to be victims of
 
00:09:41.509 --> 00:09:41.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:41.519 --> 00:09:42.310 align:start position:0%
 
no

00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:42.320 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
it has happened in the past that
 
00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
when the calendar was so full of bills
 
00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
that they split it into two
 
00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:51.440 align:start position:0%
two separate calendars
 
00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:53.920 align:start position:0%
sometimes they reverse the order in one
 
00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
or the other of those two calendars so
 
00:09:58.710 --> 00:09:58.720 align:start position:0%
it is possible that we might hear our
 
00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:00.720 align:start position:0%
bills earlier in the day at some point
 
00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
in the future but
 
00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:04.160 align:start position:0%
it's up to the leadership team and the
 
00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
without follow-up yes uh if i may
 
00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
without our advocacy is there any way
 
00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
you could advocate for uh reordering or
 
00:10:17.509 --> 00:10:17.519 align:start position:0%
no i would be happy to do it for you
 
00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
being supportive
 
00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:20.800 align:start position:0%
that that typically doesn't happen okay
 
00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:22.720 align:start position:0%
thank you okay
 
00:10:26.389 --> 00:10:26.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:26.399 --> 00:10:29.430 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
one if there's something that's a
 
00:10:33.829 --> 00:10:33.839 align:start position:0%
particular interest
 
00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:41.269 --> 00:10:41.279 align:start position:0%
yes that is correct that is correct
 
00:10:42.949 --> 00:10:42.959 align:start position:0%

informing the committee of a phone call
 
00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:32.240 align:start position:0%
that i had with vice president michael
 
00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
lacata of new hampshire
 
00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:36.800 align:start position:0%
electric co-op
 
00:11:38.949 --> 00:11:38.959 align:start position:0%
about two days after the public hearing
 
00:11:40.069 --> 00:11:40.079 align:start position:0%
on this bill
 
00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:43.200 align:start position:0%
mr licotta went back to his management
 
00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
team at the co-op and asked them to
 
00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
investigate the specific charges that
 
00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:50.160 align:start position:0%
were leveled against the co-op during
 
00:11:51.829 --> 00:11:51.839 align:start position:0%
that public hearing
 
00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:54.240 align:start position:0%
he did so and they discovered that they
 
00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
had a very well documented paper trail
 
00:11:58.550 --> 00:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
about every
 
00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
issues that the
 
00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:07.360 align:start position:0%
public hearing supposedly revealed about
 
00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
their handling of the tree cutting
 
00:12:12.389 --> 00:12:12.399 align:start position:0%
situation in wolfeboro
 
00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:14.800 align:start position:0%
and according to mr lakota the the paper
 
00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
trail showed
 
00:12:19.269 --> 00:12:19.279 align:start position:0%
that most of what we heard in testimony
 
00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
was not true
 
00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
for example
 
00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
someone testified that he had called
 
00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:26.550 align:start position:0%
someone testified that he had called
police

00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
police
 
00:12:28.949 --> 00:12:28.959 align:start position:0%
during the tree cutting operation
 
00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
when the record revealed that the police
 
00:12:34.069 --> 00:12:34.079 align:start position:0%
were called two days later
 
00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
he also said he
 
00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:39.200 align:start position:0%
spoke to the tree cutting crew the day
 
00:12:41.269 --> 00:12:41.279 align:start position:0%
that the tree cutting happened
 
00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:43.200 align:start position:0%
when in fact he wasn't even in town
 
00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
until two days later that's why he
 
00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:48.160 align:start position:0%
called the police two days later
 
00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
and there were other examples of
 
00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:54.240 align:start position:0%
errors in the record with regard to this
 
00:12:56.949 --> 00:12:56.959 align:start position:0%
gentleman's testimony
 
00:12:58.870 --> 00:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
given that reality and given the reality
 
00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:00.470 align:start position:0%
given that reality and given the reality
that

00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
passing legislation based on a single
 
00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
incident is never a good idea i will be
 
00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
voting to support the itl motion is
 
00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:10.880 align:start position:0%

00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:13.200 align:start position:0%
mcgee yes thank you mr chairman i'd just
 
00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:14.800 align:start position:0%

mr lakota and i was a co-sponsor on the
 
00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:20.160 align:start position:0%
bill with dr marsh who this was his
 
00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:21.509 align:start position:0%
bill with dr marsh who this was his
constituent

00:13:21.509 --> 00:13:21.519 align:start position:0%

and
 
00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
another point that came out after
 
00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:28.160 align:start position:0%
the fact is that the bill was written in
 
00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
order to change the requirements around
 
00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
notice if trees are going to be removed
 
00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:35.110 align:start position:0%
notice if trees are going to be removed
and

00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:35.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
when when mike licotta went back and
 
00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:38.240 align:start position:0%
looked in the records of the new
 
00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:39.670 align:start position:0%
looked in the records of the new
hampshire

00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:39.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:41.120 align:start position:0%
electric co-op
 
00:13:43.269 --> 00:13:43.279 align:start position:0%
proper notice had been given so within
 
00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
the statute that we currently have the
 
00:13:46.949 --> 00:13:46.959 align:start position:0%
rules were all followed
 
00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
don't forget to use your microphone
 
00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:57.990 align:start position:0%

please

00:13:57.990 --> 00:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
please
 
00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
mr licotte has been busy and i also
 
00:14:01.829 --> 00:14:01.839 align:start position:0%
spoke to him and and i will bring up the
 
00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
same thing that i brought up
 
00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:05.430 align:start position:0%
same thing that i brought up
uh

00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:05.440 align:start position:0%

00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
at the hearing is that we have discussed
 
00:14:10.069 --> 00:14:10.079 align:start position:0%
this and fully to taking care of this
 
00:14:13.509 --> 00:14:13.519 align:start position:0%
matter of tree cutting in the past
 
00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
so that when we do legislation we really
 
00:14:19.269 --> 00:14:19.279 align:start position:0%
have to try to do some research about
 
00:14:19.279 --> 00:14:20.150 align:start position:0%
have to try to do some research about
what

00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:20.160 align:start position:0%

already exists
 
00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:24.240 align:start position:0%

okay and that's because i was changing
 
00:15:58.790 --> 00:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
the role for the other substitutes and
 
00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:00.880 align:start position:0%
somehow you get crossed out by mistake
 
00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:05.110 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:05.120 align:start position:0%
okay

representative votes
 
00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:29.430 align:start position:0%
representative votes
yes

00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:31.120 align:start position:0%
ah come on
 
00:16:36.629 --> 00:16:36.639 align:start position:0%
that makes it 21 0 0. there's one absent
 
00:16:36.639 --> 00:16:39.269 align:start position:0%
that makes it 21 0 0. there's one absent
consent

00:16:39.269 --> 00:16:39.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:41.360 align:start position:0%
21 0
 
00:16:42.629 --> 00:16:42.639 align:start position:0%
1 yeah
 
00:16:45.829 --> 00:16:45.839 align:start position:0%
okay by a vote of 21 to nothing
 
00:16:50.069 --> 00:16:50.079 align:start position:0%
the itl motion of 8 on hb 1012 is
 
00:16:52.629 --> 00:16:52.639 align:start position:0%
adopted without objection we'll put this
 
00:16:56.069 --> 00:16:56.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:58.629 --> 00:16:58.639 align:start position:0%
i see no objection
 
00:17:01.269 --> 00:17:01.279 align:start position:0%
so we'll close the executive session on
 
00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:04.400 align:start position:0%
house bill 1012.
 
00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:06.640 align:start position:0%
i will now open the executive session on
 
00:17:08.669 --> 00:17:08.679 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
1116 relative to renewable energy
 
00:17:14.949 --> 00:17:14.959 align:start position:0%
customer generator accounts
 
00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:16.480 align:start position:0%
and credits
 
00:17:18.789 --> 00:17:18.799 align:start position:0%
and i will recognize representative
 
00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:22.720 align:start position:0%
notter thank you mr chairman i move itl
 
00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
i move to second
 
00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:26.640 align:start position:0%
representatives notter and harrington
 
00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:28.720 align:start position:0%
have moved and seconded the motion to
 
00:17:30.669 --> 00:17:30.679 align:start position:0%
itl house bill
 
00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:34.160 align:start position:0%
1116 is there any discussion
 
00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:40.400 align:start position:0%
could we hear a rationale for the itl
 
00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:45.830 align:start position:0%
could we hear a rationale for the itl
motion

00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:53.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:59.029 --> 00:17:59.039 align:start position:0%
there was a there were two major
 
00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
problems with this bill one is an
 
00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
expansion of net metering
 
00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
that probably should be studied before
 
00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
it's implemented and the second problem
 
00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.789 align:start position:0%
it's implemented and the second problem
is

00:18:10.789 --> 00:18:10.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
a more delicate one i would say
 
00:18:15.909 --> 00:18:15.919 align:start position:0%
and that is
 
00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
the sponsor of the bill
 
00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:20.720 align:start position:0%
had a family farm that would directly
 
00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:22.480 align:start position:0%
benefit from the bill which seemed to be
 
00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:23.270 align:start position:0%
benefit from the bill which seemed to be
a

00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
pretty significant conflict of interest
 
00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
so i don't think it's worthwhile to go
 
00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
forward with such a bill in that uh
 
00:18:32.549 --> 00:18:32.559 align:start position:0%
given those circumstances any further
 
00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
discussion yeah yeah
 
00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:37.510 align:start position:0%
discussion yeah yeah
representative

00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:39.200 align:start position:0%
callie pitts
 
00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:41.190 align:start position:0%
callie pitts
um

00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:41.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:45.029 --> 00:18:45.039 align:start position:0%
i'd i'd like to comment on what the uh
 
00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
speaker just said
 
00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
there's no conflict of interest unless
 
00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:51.440 align:start position:0%
you declare a conflict of interest and
 
00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:53.360 align:start position:0%
you can declare it i don't believe this
 
00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
was a conflict of interest this was
 
00:18:58.310 --> 00:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
basically a bill and i don't know if the
 
00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
people who are here are up to snuff on
 
00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
it to combine accounts if you had more
 
00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:05.440 align:start position:0%
than one account
 
00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:12.160 align:start position:0%
some some uh
 
00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:14.320 align:start position:0%
computer changes some
 
00:19:17.669 --> 00:19:17.679 align:start position:0%
and some i believe some expense on the
 
00:19:20.549 --> 00:19:20.559 align:start position:0%
part of the utilities to combine those
 
00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
that's what the basic premise of the
 
00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
bill was
 
00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
so i
 
00:19:28.549 --> 00:19:28.559 align:start position:0%
i don't believe there was any
 
00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
malice because representative oxen
 
00:19:32.789 --> 00:19:32.799 align:start position:0%
resident creation
 
00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
representative wall senator
 
00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
senator waters i don't believe
 
00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:40.160 align:start position:0%
that there was an absolute conflict and
 
00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:42.160 align:start position:0%
i would leave that out of it i i just
 
00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
think that the combining of these
 
00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:44.710 align:start position:0%
think that the combining of these
accounts

00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:44.720 align:start position:0%
accounts
 
00:19:46.549 --> 00:19:46.559 align:start position:0%
might in the future be a very good idea
 
00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
if you have more than one account why
 
00:19:49.669 --> 00:19:49.679 align:start position:0%
not put them together
 
00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:52.160 align:start position:0%
but at this point i don't think we have
 
00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
enough information on how it would be
 
00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.470 align:start position:0%
enough information on how it would be
done

00:19:56.470 --> 00:19:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:59.430 --> 00:19:59.440 align:start position:0%
thank you representative uh mcgee
 
00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:01.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman yeah i just wanted
 
00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
to sort of reiterate that
 
00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
on the first point of expanding that
 
00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
metering this wouldn't actually expand
 
00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:08.320 align:start position:0%
anything it just says if you have
 
00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
multiple accounts and you have a credit
 
00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
on one you can apply it to the other and
 
00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
that's kind of a way of balancing
 
00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:17.360 align:start position:0%
the um expenses that you have
 
00:20:20.149 --> 00:20:20.159 align:start position:0%
uh i i think that
 
00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:22.400 align:start position:0%
representative mick williams
 
00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
understanding the situation came from
 
00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
the fact that she's one of those
 
00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:27.280 align:start position:0%
customers but there are other people
 
00:20:28.789 --> 00:20:28.799 align:start position:0%
besides her that she was thinking of
 
00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:30.640 align:start position:0%
when she was trying to figure out a way
 
00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:32.149 align:start position:0%
when she was trying to figure out a way
to

00:20:32.149 --> 00:20:32.159 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:20:33.909 --> 00:20:33.919 align:start position:0%
accommodate that particular situation
 
00:20:35.909 --> 00:20:35.919 align:start position:0%
which i think makes perfect sense
 
00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:38.240 align:start position:0%
on the notes that i have here the only
 
00:20:41.029 --> 00:20:41.039 align:start position:0%
um question that i had was the
 
00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:43.919 align:start position:0%
effectiveness dates 60 days after might
 
00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
not be
 
00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
possible for the implementation as we
 
00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:49.600 align:start position:0%
discussed there might be system updates
 
00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
that would be required to allow the
 
00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:54.640 align:start position:0%
billing to do what she's asking it to do
 
00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:56.240 align:start position:0%
um but
 
00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:57.270 align:start position:0%
um but
uh

00:20:57.270 --> 00:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:20:58.710 --> 00:20:58.720 align:start position:0%
you know that would be more of an
 
00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
amendment than a than an itl so
 
00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
representative plett has a comment yes i
 
00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
think i'm the only
 
00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
committee member who actually worked for
 
00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:10.310 align:start position:0%
committee member who actually worked for
utility

00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
utility
 
00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:11.590 align:start position:0%
utility
psnh

00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
psnh
 
00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
what she's asking is a building
 
00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:15.190 align:start position:0%
what she's asking is a building
nightmare

00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:15.200 align:start position:0%
nightmare
 
00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
it would involve a huge amount of uh
 
00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:18.390 align:start position:0%
it would involve a huge amount of uh
cost

00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:18.400 align:start position:0%
cost
 
00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
to to implement it's just and that's the
 
00:21:22.789 --> 00:21:22.799 align:start position:0%
what i walked away with when we heard
 
00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
the bill to me this is an itl because
 
00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:31.029 --> 00:21:31.039 align:start position:0%
any further discussion representative
 
00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:33.280 align:start position:0%
cam girls
 
00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
oh sorry representative harrington
 
00:21:37.669 --> 00:21:37.679 align:start position:0%
not to correct fred all the time but i
 
00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
also worked for utility fred
 
00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
anyways that's one of the reasons this
 
00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
be creates a problem is it's not limited
 
00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:46.240 align:start position:0%
to a single utility if you could have a
 
00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:48.320 align:start position:0%
customer would have multiple accounts
 
00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:50.720 align:start position:0%
one with unitil and one with
 
00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
eversource and i don't know how this
 
00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
would work it doesn't address that and
 
00:21:56.149 --> 00:21:56.159 align:start position:0%
there is going to be cost associated
 
00:21:57.669 --> 00:21:57.679 align:start position:0%
with it that the utility would simply
 
00:21:59.909 --> 00:21:59.919 align:start position:0%
pass on to ratepayers if we wanted to
 
00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
look at something like this in the
 
00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
future any cost associated with
 
00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:04.720 align:start position:0%
implementing this should be paid by the
 
00:22:06.789 --> 00:22:06.799 align:start position:0%
people getting the advantage of it and
 
00:22:08.789 --> 00:22:08.799 align:start position:0%
not just put it into general rates
 
00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:10.840 align:start position:0%
that's why i support the
 
00:22:15.669 --> 00:22:15.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
on the issue of conflict of interest
 
00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
you turned your mic off
 
00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
now it's on now
 
00:22:27.669 --> 00:22:27.679 align:start position:0%
so red red is on and green is off right
 
00:22:27.679 --> 00:22:28.630 align:start position:0%
so red red is on and green is off right
great

00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:28.640 align:start position:0%
great
 
00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
on the issue of conflict of interest
 
00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:33.200 align:start position:0%
i've spoken with the legal counsel
 
00:22:34.789 --> 00:22:34.799 align:start position:0%
formerly of the puc now of the
 
00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:36.320 align:start position:0%
department of energy
 
00:22:40.789 --> 00:22:40.799 align:start position:0%
and people who have renewable energy are
 
00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
not conflicted out from
 
00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:46.480 align:start position:0%
discussing issues related to the fact
 
00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
that they are renewable energy owners
 
00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
this notion that there's an unfair
 
00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:53.440 align:start position:0%
advantage is one that i had hoped to by
 
00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
this time we would have dispelled people
 
00:22:59.029 --> 00:22:59.039 align:start position:0%
who have invested in renewable energy
 
00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:02.240 align:start position:0%
have sacrificed in order to do so they
 
00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:04.480 align:start position:0%
have been incentivized by the state to
 
00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
do so because the state finds it in the
 
00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
interests of the state that there be
 
00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
more distributed energy resources and
 
00:23:15.029 --> 00:23:15.039 align:start position:0%
that we be less reliant on fossil fuels
 
00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
therefore measures have been instituted
 
00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:20.240 align:start position:0%
to incentivize people to spend their own
 
00:23:22.789 --> 00:23:22.799 align:start position:0%
money and invest in an investment that
 
00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
does not return at all
 
00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
in commence commensurate with a market
 
00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:29.200 align:start position:0%
investment that you could have made at
 
00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:31.360 align:start position:0%
the same time there's a substantial
 
00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:34.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity cost for having made this
 
00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
secondly in terms of the particular
 
00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
representative she has filed conflict of
 
00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:42.400 align:start position:0%
interest uh the ethics form excuse me
 
00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:44.480 align:start position:0%
the disclosure to say that she is a
 
00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
renewable energy user so that is on
 
00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:48.630 align:start position:0%
renewable energy user so that is on
record

00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:48.640 align:start position:0%
record
 
00:23:50.789 --> 00:23:50.799 align:start position:0%
and uh the final point was about the
 
00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
cost of implementation we've been told
 
00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:56.240 align:start position:0%
again and again by the utilities
 
00:24:00.149 --> 00:24:00.159 align:start position:0%
that they do this by hand they they have
 
00:24:00.159 --> 00:24:01.110 align:start position:0%
that they do this by hand they they have
not

00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:24:04.470 --> 00:24:04.480 align:start position:0%
automated how they manage these accounts
 
00:24:07.029 --> 00:24:07.039 align:start position:0%
so the the notion that there has to be
 
00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
this enormous billing change
 
00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:12.400 align:start position:0%
it's all done by hand already
 
00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:14.240 align:start position:0%
i appreciate representative harrington's
 
00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:16.320 align:start position:0%
comment about multiple utilities i think
 
00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:18.720 align:start position:0%
that's a very rare instance but it's
 
00:24:20.789 --> 00:24:20.799 align:start position:0%
certainly one in which if were we to
 
00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:23.200 align:start position:0%
send this bill to the senate it could be
 
00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
considered and and added in it has as it
 
00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
has been in the group host net metering
 
00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:31.200 align:start position:0%
that you must be in the same utility or
 
00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:32.720 align:start position:0%
it doesn't apply
 
00:24:34.549 --> 00:24:34.559 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative ox and i'm any
 
00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative
 
00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:40.390 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative
pementel

00:24:40.390 --> 00:24:40.400 align:start position:0%
pementel
 
00:24:42.149 --> 00:24:42.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:24:45.669 --> 00:24:45.679 align:start position:0%
if we do manage to not itl this
 
00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:47.440 align:start position:0%
there is an amendment
 
00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:49.120 align:start position:0%
that has been submitted
 
00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:50.350 align:start position:0%
that has been submitted
uh

00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:50.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:51.909 align:start position:0%
uh
0.737

00:24:51.909 --> 00:24:51.919 align:start position:0%
0.737
 
00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
which addresses the issue of uh
 
00:24:58.230 --> 00:24:58.240 align:start position:0%
that it have they have to be
 
00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
in the same utility and it also
 
00:25:05.029 --> 00:25:05.039 align:start position:0%
addresses the mechanism to um
 
00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:08.080 align:start position:0%
to recover costs for the utilities for
 
00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:12.880 align:start position:0%
the other thing i want to mention is
 
00:25:14.789 --> 00:25:14.799 align:start position:0%
that there are
 
00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
people now
 
00:25:19.269 --> 00:25:19.279 align:start position:0%
residents who have
 
00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:20.960 align:start position:0%
two meters
 
00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
every source
 
00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
allows people to put in a second meter
 
00:25:30.149 --> 00:25:30.159 align:start position:0%
for their
 
00:25:30.159 --> 00:25:32.070 align:start position:0%
for their
heating

00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
heating
 
00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
which get a different rate
 
00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:40.640 align:start position:0%
puts on put solar panels on
 
00:25:42.630 --> 00:25:42.640 align:start position:0%
they're not going to be able to
 
00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:43.750 align:start position:0%
they're not going to be able to
uh

00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:46.400 align:start position:0%
include both of those metered
 
00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:48.640 align:start position:0%
uh costs just one of them
 
00:25:53.669 --> 00:25:53.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:55.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank you any uh additional
 
00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:58.789 align:start position:0%
okay thank you any uh additional
comments

00:25:58.789 --> 00:25:58.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:01.029 --> 00:26:01.039 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts this this
 
00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
committee has never
 
00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
well i won't say never
 
00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
but has a reputation for not walking
 
00:26:10.390 --> 00:26:10.400 align:start position:0%
away from complicated or
 
00:26:13.350 --> 00:26:13.360 align:start position:0%
complex issues that's what we're about
 
00:26:16.549 --> 00:26:16.559 align:start position:0%
that's what we're supposed to be about
 
00:26:19.269 --> 00:26:19.279 align:start position:0%
my problem with this bill if there is a
 
00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
pending amendment i can't vote on
 
00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:23.200 align:start position:0%
something i don't see
 
00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:24.400 align:start position:0%
and my problem
 
00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:26.400 align:start position:0%
is very simple
 
00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:28.240 align:start position:0%
something my mother used to say to me
 
00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
all the time the devils and the details
 
00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
and we don't have the details so i think
 
00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
this is a worthy subject
 
00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
it needs more work there's a way you we
 
00:26:41.110 --> 00:26:41.120 align:start position:0%
can put it off
 
00:26:44.549 --> 00:26:44.559 align:start position:0%
and put it into interim study
 
00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:48.320 align:start position:0%
but i have a feeling that interim study
 
00:26:50.149 --> 00:26:50.159 align:start position:0%
we have one bill in there already and i
 
00:26:52.870 --> 00:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
don't think two will happen we are a
 
00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
committee that's supposed to be handling
 
00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:56.950 align:start position:0%
committee that's supposed to be handling
complexities

00:26:56.950 --> 00:26:56.960 align:start position:0%

00:29:08.389 --> 00:29:08.399 align:start position:0%
it's hard to read this thing one two
 
00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
three four all right hang on let's get
 
00:29:12.549 --> 00:29:12.559 align:start position:0%
the correct vote count eleven through
 
00:29:12.559 --> 00:29:13.430 align:start position:0%
the correct vote count eleven through
white

00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
white
 
00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
twelve thirteen
 
00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:17.120 align:start position:0%
thirteen eight
 
00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:19.520 align:start position:0%
the wiki is not present and i ha that's
 
00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:22.480 align:start position:0%
it thirteen eight one
 
00:29:24.549 --> 00:29:24.559 align:start position:0%
there's twenty-two
 
00:29:26.789 --> 00:29:26.799 align:start position:0%
my apology
 
00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:28.320 align:start position:0%
all right so the
 
00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:31.120 align:start position:0%
the count of 13 to eight is correct and
 
00:29:35.029 --> 00:29:35.039 align:start position:0%
the motion to itl house bill 1116 passes
 
00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
and so we will close the public hearing
 
00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:46.710 --> 00:29:46.720 align:start position:0%
i will now open a public hearing on
 
00:29:50.389 --> 00:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:52.789 --> 00:29:52.799 align:start position:0%
exact session i'm sorry
 
00:29:56.870 --> 00:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:58.630 --> 00:29:58.640 align:start position:0%
so we're going to open an exec session
 
00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
on house bill 1328
 
00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:08.070 align:start position:0%

the both bills representative mcgee
 
00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:12.880 align:start position:0%
will there be a minority report for
 
00:30:16.149 --> 00:30:16.159 align:start position:0%

1328 is there any discussion
 
00:31:11.190 --> 00:31:11.200 align:start position:0%
representative harrington
 
00:31:13.669 --> 00:31:13.679 align:start position:0%
yeah this is just an another step in our
 
00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
deregulation of telephones uh that's
 
00:31:18.789 --> 00:31:18.799 align:start position:0%
been going on for quite some time uh
 
00:31:20.789 --> 00:31:20.799 align:start position:0%
maine and vermont have had similar laws
 
00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:23.600 align:start position:0%
for over six years without any problems
 
00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:26.320 align:start position:0%
uh there is some form of this law in 38
 
00:31:28.630 --> 00:31:28.640 align:start position:0%
other states and it's just no reason to
 
00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:32.320 align:start position:0%
hold on to the old uh you know a t and t
 
00:31:34.549 --> 00:31:34.559 align:start position:0%
marbell regulations that are no longer
 
00:31:34.559 --> 00:31:37.750 align:start position:0%

what exactly representative oxen are you
 
00:31:59.029 --> 00:31:59.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:01.269 --> 00:32:01.279 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i'm passing out an
 
00:32:03.509 --> 00:32:03.519 align:start position:0%
information sheet that speaks to
 
00:32:05.029 --> 00:32:05.039 align:start position:0%
questions that were raised and not
 
00:32:08.549 --> 00:32:08.559 align:start position:0%
answered at the public hearing on 13 28.
 
00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:10.640 align:start position:0%
it's being passed around
 
00:32:12.389 --> 00:32:12.399 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
00:32:14.789 --> 00:32:14.799 align:start position:0%
okay thank you in fact i need one myself
 
00:32:16.950 --> 00:32:16.960 align:start position:0%
i seem to pass them all out
 
00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
do you want to be recognized to speak to
 
00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:20.240 align:start position:0%
this uh
 
00:32:22.389 --> 00:32:22.399 align:start position:0%
sheet that you passed out
 
00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:24.240 align:start position:0%
i i would thank you very much if i could
 
00:32:26.549 --> 00:32:26.559 align:start position:0%
just wait one moment while i get handed
 
00:32:32.549 --> 00:32:32.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:34.389 --> 00:32:34.399 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry we've always
 
00:32:36.630 --> 00:32:36.640 align:start position:0%
done this in numerical order and
 
00:32:37.909 --> 00:32:37.919 align:start position:0%
calling it
 
00:32:42.870 --> 00:32:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:44.320 align:start position:0%
the handout
 
00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:46.240 align:start position:0%
seeks to answer several questions that
 
00:32:49.269 --> 00:32:49.279 align:start position:0%
were raised at the public hearing to
 
00:32:51.509 --> 00:32:51.519 align:start position:0%
which we did not have an answer
 
00:32:52.950 --> 00:32:52.960 align:start position:0%
um i
 
00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
downloaded this from
 
00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:56.389 align:start position:0%
downloaded this from
the

00:32:56.389 --> 00:32:56.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:32:58.630 --> 00:32:58.640 align:start position:0%
nri which is a research institute
 
00:33:00.789 --> 00:33:00.799 align:start position:0%
attached to the national public
 
00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
utilities commission organization

00:33:09.909 --> 00:33:09.919 align:start position:0%
the beginning
 
00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:13.120 align:start position:0%
colr is the abbreviation for carrier of
 
00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:14.720 align:start position:0%
last resort
 
00:33:16.549 --> 00:33:16.559 align:start position:0%
and the question was raised during the
 
00:33:16.559 --> 00:33:17.990 align:start position:0%
and the question was raised during the
hearing

00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:20.320 align:start position:0%
why we would be discussing this at this
 
00:33:22.149 --> 00:33:22.159 align:start position:0%
point in time
 
00:33:26.230 --> 00:33:26.240 align:start position:0%
so many states have begun to re-examine
 
00:33:28.950 --> 00:33:28.960 align:start position:0%
their carrier of last resort
 
00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:30.870 align:start position:0%
their carrier of last resort
obligation

00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
obligation
 
00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
um if you turn to the second page which
 
00:33:36.389 --> 00:33:36.399 align:start position:0%
is the conclusions and recommendations
 
00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
of this um lengthy and uh detailed study
 
00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:42.720 align:start position:0%
that was produced in 2016
 
00:33:44.070 --> 00:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
you'll find
 
00:33:46.470 --> 00:33:46.480 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:33:48.630 --> 00:33:48.640 align:start position:0%
i think it's it's actually going to be
 
00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:50.640 align:start position:0%
quicker if i just read you a couple of
 
00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:53.440 align:start position:0%
key sentences kohler policies have been
 
00:33:55.669 --> 00:33:55.679 align:start position:0%
a critical part of ensuring universal
 
00:33:58.710 --> 00:33:58.720 align:start position:0%
access to telecommunications services
 
00:33:58.720 --> 00:33:59.990 align:start position:0%
access to telecommunications services
competition

00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
competition
 
00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
and the transition to broadband have
 
00:34:05.029 --> 00:34:05.039 align:start position:0%
reduced but not eliminated the need to
 
00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
designate a carrier that will be
 
00:34:10.230 --> 00:34:10.240 align:start position:0%
available to provide service in areas
 
00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
where competition has not taken root
 
00:34:14.869 --> 00:34:14.879 align:start position:0%
the kohler would continue to be
 
00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
designated by the state commission but
 
00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
need not be the islet or provide service
 
00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
using any specific technology then
 
00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:24.560 align:start position:0%
skipping down to the next paragraph
 
00:34:26.710 --> 00:34:26.720 align:start position:0%
kohler policies provide a backstop for
 
00:34:28.470 --> 00:34:28.480 align:start position:0%
areas where competitive carriers may
 
00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:30.560 align:start position:0%
choose to withdraw service and those
 
00:34:32.950 --> 00:34:32.960 align:start position:0%
areas where carriers may fail or may
 
00:34:35.430 --> 00:34:35.440 align:start position:0%
abandon service altogether in these
 
00:34:37.430 --> 00:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
areas the designation of a carrier of
 
00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:39.760 align:start position:0%
last resort remains important rather
 
00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
than anachronistic
 
00:34:43.430 --> 00:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
kohler duties remain a key means of
 
00:34:46.389 --> 00:34:46.399 align:start position:0%
ensuring the universal availability of
 
00:34:49.349 --> 00:34:49.359 align:start position:0%
both voice and broadband services
 
00:34:51.109 --> 00:34:51.119 align:start position:0%
the modifications to these requirements
 
00:34:52.869 --> 00:34:52.879 align:start position:0%
described in this paper
 
00:34:55.829 --> 00:34:55.839 align:start position:0%
particularly expanding it to broadband
 
00:34:57.670 --> 00:34:57.680 align:start position:0%
include limitations on kohler service
 
00:34:59.430 --> 00:34:59.440 align:start position:0%
where competition provides customers
 
00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
with options and the acceptance of
 
00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:03.280 align:start position:0%
alternate technologies which will help
 
00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:05.680 align:start position:0%
ensure the requirement remains viable
 
00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:06.470 align:start position:0%
ensure the requirement remains viable
so

00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
in their conclusion states considering
 
00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:11.440 align:start position:0%
legislation to change or abandon kohler
 
00:35:13.109 --> 00:35:13.119 align:start position:0%
requirements should consider the
 
00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
following questions in developing their
 
00:35:17.109 --> 00:35:17.119 align:start position:0%
recommendations on this subject
 
00:35:19.589 --> 00:35:19.599 align:start position:0%
how should color requirements be defined
 
00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:20.960 align:start position:0%
should they be broadened to include
 
00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:23.440 align:start position:0%
broadband should callers be required to
 
00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
offer basic service and if so what are
 
00:35:28.950 --> 00:35:28.960 align:start position:0%
the minimum requirements is competition
 
00:35:31.349 --> 00:35:31.359 align:start position:0%
in areas with limitations on service
 
00:35:33.670 --> 00:35:33.680 align:start position:0%
sufficient to ensure that at least one
 
00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
carrier capable of offering service to
 
00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:37.030 align:start position:0%
carrier capable of offering service to
all

00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
will remain
 
00:35:40.069 --> 00:35:40.079 align:start position:0%
how should that level of competition be
 
00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:42.160 align:start position:0%
reviewed how should competition be
 
00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
measured must a competitive provider be
 
00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
available to all customers in an area
 
00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:48.240 align:start position:0%
before the existing caller is allowed to
 
00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:49.270 align:start position:0%
before the existing caller is allowed to
exit

00:35:49.270 --> 00:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
exit
 
00:35:50.950 --> 00:35:50.960 align:start position:0%
what process should the state use to
 
00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:52.960 align:start position:0%
ensure that competition continues to
 
00:35:55.910 --> 00:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
provide affordable service and that it
 
00:35:58.550 --> 00:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
is available to all
 
00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:00.880 align:start position:0%
the point here is that we have a series
 
00:36:04.310 --> 00:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
of questions which were raised in the uh
 
00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
in the public hearing
 
00:36:07.589 --> 00:36:07.599 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
um it's clear nationwide that this is an
 
00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
issue that is under consideration and i
 
00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
feel that this this bill is premature
 
00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
in seeking to cut off
 
00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
access to this lifeline of
 
00:36:24.950 --> 00:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
communications and i propose that
 
00:36:27.670 --> 00:36:27.680 align:start position:0%
we vote down the itl or i'm sorry is
 
00:36:29.349 --> 00:36:29.359 align:start position:0%
this not to pass
 
00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
yes yes
 
00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
i propose that we vote down the ought to
 
00:36:34.310 --> 00:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
pass and instead send this to interim
 
00:36:37.109 --> 00:36:37.119 align:start position:0%
service the the questions which are
 
00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
registered here in the recommendations
 
00:36:42.310 --> 00:36:42.320 align:start position:0%
of this study demonstrate that we need
 
00:36:45.109 --> 00:36:45.119 align:start position:0%
to look at this take it very seriously
 
00:36:48.310 --> 00:36:48.320 align:start position:0%
this can be in fact a matter of life and
 
00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:50.480 align:start position:0%
death to our constituents
 
00:36:52.870 --> 00:36:52.880 align:start position:0%
and we should be protective of their
 
00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:54.560 align:start position:0%
interests thank you
 
00:36:56.310 --> 00:36:56.320 align:start position:0%
thank you representative oxenom for
 
00:36:58.310 --> 00:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
bringing this study to our attention
 
00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
representative plett has a comment yes
 
00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:03.040 align:start position:0%
i'd respond i
 
00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:05.440 align:start position:0%
disagree with my esteemed colleague
 
00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
because in the bill itself it says that
 
00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:09.190 align:start position:0%
because in the bill itself it says that
the

00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:09.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:37:11.349 --> 00:37:11.359 align:start position:0%
uh the the only way the department of
 
00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
energy can approve a petition
 
00:37:15.349 --> 00:37:15.359 align:start position:0%
uh to uh
 
00:37:17.190 --> 00:37:17.200 align:start position:0%
be relieved of carrier of last resort is
 
00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:18.560 align:start position:0%
that the
 
00:37:20.870 --> 00:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
uh at least one wire line facilities
 
00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
based voice network service provider
 
00:37:24.310 --> 00:37:24.320 align:start position:0%
other than incumbent offers service to
 
00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:26.480 align:start position:0%
at least 95 percent of the households in
 
00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
the municipality and one or more mobile
 
00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
telecommunications service provider
 
00:37:32.470 --> 00:37:32.480 align:start position:0%
office on the aggregate mobile
 
00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
telecommunications service release 97
 
00:37:37.109 --> 00:37:37.119 align:start position:0%
of the households in the municipality
 
00:37:39.109 --> 00:37:39.119 align:start position:0%
and i think even if abandoned carry a
 
00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
last resort they still have to keep
 
00:37:44.710 --> 00:37:44.720 align:start position:0%

cretian
 
00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:50.800 align:start position:0%
the point that i wanted to to highlight
 
00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:53.200 align:start position:0%
in this um is i guess related to
 
00:37:54.950 --> 00:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
representative plet's last point that
 
00:37:57.349 --> 00:37:57.359 align:start position:0%
this will require um some effort by the
 
00:37:59.750 --> 00:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
department of energy to actually analyze
 
00:38:01.829 --> 00:38:01.839 align:start position:0%
these things um i noticed in the fiscal
 
00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:04.720 align:start position:0%
note that this will require likely the
 
00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:06.720 align:start position:0%
employment of some consultants ranging
 
00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:08.560 align:start position:0%
between fifty thousand and a hundred
 
00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars um i'm not convinced
 
00:38:13.030 --> 00:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
that this is an urgent enough issue for
 
00:38:16.069 --> 00:38:16.079 align:start position:0%
the state to to kill um to pay to kill i
 
00:38:19.829 --> 00:38:19.839 align:start position:0%
guess um that's my only comment

00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
all through these last few weeks and
 
00:38:30.829 --> 00:38:30.839 align:start position:0%
hearings i've been very concerned with
 
00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
9-1-1 and what we used to call
 
00:38:35.430 --> 00:38:35.440 align:start position:0%
left-in-dial tone
 
00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:36.550 align:start position:0%
left-in-dial tone
and

00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:36.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
that is not mandatory at this point and
 
00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:42.240 align:start position:0%
i was surprised to hear that
 
00:38:44.870 --> 00:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
i do believe that this bill should go
 
00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
forward i believe it should because
 
00:38:51.829 --> 00:38:51.839 align:start position:0%
you can't just fold up shop and leave
 
00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:53.680 align:start position:0%
it's not like a business
 
00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
yet you can just
 
00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:56.870 align:start position:0%
yet you can just
leave

00:38:56.870 --> 00:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
leave
 
00:38:58.710 --> 00:38:58.720 align:start position:0%
so i i don't think it's going to leave
 
00:39:00.790 --> 00:39:00.800 align:start position:0%
anyone in a lurch
 
00:39:03.349 --> 00:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
but i do
 
00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
and want to correct that point about
 
00:39:07.589 --> 00:39:07.599 align:start position:0%
9-1-1 because i asked that question
 
00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:08.960 align:start position:0%
during the hearing
 
00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
and they said no they do not have to
 
00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:18.310 --> 00:39:18.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
i will point out that during the course
 
00:39:22.069 --> 00:39:22.079 align:start position:0%
of the public hearing on this bill we
 
00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
heard that
 
00:39:25.829 --> 00:39:25.839 align:start position:0%
relieving the incumbent utilities
 
00:39:28.310 --> 00:39:28.320 align:start position:0%
of this obligation will reduce costs
 
00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:31.040 align:start position:0%
which is important to all of us
 
00:39:32.630 --> 00:39:32.640 align:start position:0%
and it will also
 
00:39:35.190 --> 00:39:35.200 align:start position:0%
remove a public utilities commission
 
00:39:37.829 --> 00:39:37.839 align:start position:0%
assessment which is no longer needed
 
00:39:39.829 --> 00:39:39.839 align:start position:0%
because the public utilities commission
 
00:39:41.670 --> 00:39:41.680 align:start position:0%
does not regulate
 
00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
these services so those are two good
 
00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:46.240 align:start position:0%
reasons why we should we should pass
 
00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:47.680 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:39:50.790 --> 00:39:50.800 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion
 
00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
representative thomas thank you mr chair
 
00:39:55.510 --> 00:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
in addition to what has been said i also
 
00:39:58.069 --> 00:39:58.079 align:start position:0%
believe this bill should be passed
 
00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
not only because of on its merits but it
 
00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
gives this
 
00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
our folks on the other side of the wall
 
00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
a chance to have further discussion into
 
00:40:09.030 --> 00:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:40:11.109 --> 00:40:11.119 align:start position:0%
to i'm sure they will come up with some
 
00:40:13.270 --> 00:40:13.280 align:start position:0%
tweaks along the way to make it an
 
00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
actually even better bill so it's
 
00:40:16.950 --> 00:40:16.960 align:start position:0%
another reason for passing this bill i
 
00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:18.400 align:start position:0%
believe our friends on the other side
 
00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:20.480 align:start position:0%
will be discussing this at length to
 
00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
come up with
 
00:40:25.430 --> 00:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:28.790 --> 00:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:31.910 --> 00:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
representative oxenom
 
00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
just to
 
00:40:37.589 --> 00:40:37.599 align:start position:0%
respond to representative plett's uh
 
00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:40.160 align:start position:0%
informed comment about the text of the
 
00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:41.190 align:start position:0%
informed comment about the text of the
bill

00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:41.200 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:40:43.589 --> 00:40:43.599 align:start position:0%
95 percent and 97
 
00:40:45.270 --> 00:40:45.280 align:start position:0%
is not 100
 
00:40:47.750 --> 00:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
and as i represent an area which has
 
00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:50.800 align:start position:0%
substantial areas of
 
00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
non-coverage by alternatives i'm very
 
00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
concerned about moving forward uh with
 
00:40:58.870 --> 00:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
with an issue once again
 
00:41:01.430 --> 00:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
it's all about saving pennies on the
 
00:41:05.349 --> 00:41:05.359 align:start position:0%
dollar and not being protective of the
 
00:41:07.430 --> 00:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
interests of the people that we came
 
00:41:09.109 --> 00:41:09.119 align:start position:0%
here to represent
 
00:41:11.349 --> 00:41:11.359 align:start position:0%
i'm not asking that we
 
00:41:13.670 --> 00:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
foreclose this bill i'm asking that we
 
00:41:16.710 --> 00:41:16.720 align:start position:0%
send it to interim study so that the the
 
00:41:19.109 --> 00:41:19.119 align:start position:0%
really profound issues that are raised
 
00:41:22.150 --> 00:41:22.160 align:start position:0%
here can be considered in greater depth
 
00:41:24.790 --> 00:41:24.800 align:start position:0%
than a 10-minute discussion uh by this
 
00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:26.950 align:start position:0%
than a 10-minute discussion uh by this
committee

00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:41:29.589 --> 00:41:29.599 align:start position:0%
representative harrington is recognized
 
00:41:30.870 --> 00:41:30.880 align:start position:0%
yeah i hear this i'm going to make a
 
00:41:32.309 --> 00:41:32.319 align:start position:0%
statement that i would if you would ask
 
00:41:34.950 --> 00:41:34.960 align:start position:0%
me six months ago or a few years ago i
 
00:41:36.790 --> 00:41:36.800 align:start position:0%
would have said no way
 
00:41:39.270 --> 00:41:39.280 align:start position:0%
on saturday i opened up my mailbox and
 
00:41:41.589 --> 00:41:41.599 align:start position:0%
what was in there it was a card from a
 
00:41:44.309 --> 00:41:44.319 align:start position:0%
company that is going to excuse me be
 
00:41:45.829 --> 00:41:45.839 align:start position:0%
expanding uh
 
00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:48.720 align:start position:0%
fiber broadband into strafford the town
 
00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
that i live in which is a very rural
 
00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:52.640 align:start position:0%
community it's about 50 square miles
 
00:41:54.790 --> 00:41:54.800 align:start position:0%
about 4 000 people
 
00:41:56.470 --> 00:41:56.480 align:start position:0%
and i would never thought the day would
 
00:41:58.710 --> 00:41:58.720 align:start position:0%
come when competition would be a present
 
00:42:00.790 --> 00:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
in my choice of broadband
 
00:42:02.470 --> 00:42:02.480 align:start position:0%
but now it is or it's going to be
 
00:42:03.990 --> 00:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
shortly i think that's the way we're
 
00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
heading uh between satellites and fiber
 
00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:10.720 align:start position:0%
and traditional uh cable and telephone
 
00:42:13.109 --> 00:42:13.119 align:start position:0%
service uh people aren't running away
 
00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
you're gonna have more options not less
 
00:42:17.670 --> 00:42:17.680 align:start position:0%
in the future
 
00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
thank you further discussion
 
00:42:21.990 --> 00:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
representative pementel is recognized
 
00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:24.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh
 
00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:26.960 align:start position:0%
i agree with uh
 
00:42:28.870 --> 00:42:28.880 align:start position:0%
the representative that
 
00:42:31.109 --> 00:42:31.119 align:start position:0%
that is the way we are moving
 
00:42:33.430 --> 00:42:33.440 align:start position:0%
but we're not there yet
 
00:42:36.309 --> 00:42:36.319 align:start position:0%
95 percent is not a hundred percent
 
00:42:36.319 --> 00:42:37.190 align:start position:0%
95 percent is not a hundred percent
um

00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:38.710 --> 00:42:38.720 align:start position:0%
if we remove
 
00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:40.069 align:start position:0%
if we remove
uh

00:42:40.069 --> 00:42:40.079 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:42:42.870 --> 00:42:42.880 align:start position:0%
kohler from one carrier we're not giving
 
00:42:46.230 --> 00:42:46.240 align:start position:0%
it to another so in fact anyone in that
 
00:42:48.550 --> 00:42:48.560 align:start position:0%
area no longer
 
00:42:50.710 --> 00:42:50.720 align:start position:0%
has or will have
 
00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:52.230 align:start position:0%
has or will have
a

00:42:52.230 --> 00:42:52.240 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:42:56.790 --> 00:42:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:59.109 --> 00:42:59.119 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:43:01.030 --> 00:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative callie
 
00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:02.390 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative callie
bits

00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
bits
 
00:43:04.950 --> 00:43:04.960 align:start position:0%
it is my belief and i would like uh
 
00:43:07.589 --> 00:43:07.599 align:start position:0%
representative harrington who was a
 
00:43:10.069 --> 00:43:10.079 align:start position:0%
public utilities commissioner
 
00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:12.400 align:start position:0%
to please correct me if i'm wrong but
 
00:43:14.069 --> 00:43:14.079 align:start position:0%
they can't do that they can't just
 
00:43:16.230 --> 00:43:16.240 align:start position:0%
abandon and leave customers without
 
00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:17.270 align:start position:0%
abandon and leave customers without
service

00:43:17.270 --> 00:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
service
 
00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
because when they go for the petition
 
00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:23.680 align:start position:0%
to do that there has to be
 
00:43:25.589 --> 00:43:25.599 align:start position:0%
somebody else who's going to take it
 
00:43:27.109 --> 00:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
over now is it going to be at the same
 
00:43:29.270 --> 00:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
price no
 
00:43:32.069 --> 00:43:32.079 align:start position:0%
i don't know maybe less maybe more
 
00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:34.960 align:start position:0%
but they can't just abandon and leave
 
00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:35.990 align:start position:0%
but they can't just abandon and leave
people

00:43:35.990 --> 00:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:43:39.589 --> 00:43:39.599 align:start position:0%
in the lurch with no service
 
00:43:42.550 --> 00:43:42.560 align:start position:0%
i i believe that's correct can can
 
00:43:44.550 --> 00:43:44.560 align:start position:0%
anybody correct me
 
00:43:46.630 --> 00:43:46.640 align:start position:0%
representative harrington
 
00:43:48.390 --> 00:43:48.400 align:start position:0%
i i don't know the technicalities of
 
00:43:49.990 --> 00:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
that uh that thing i know a lot of
 
00:43:51.510 --> 00:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
requirements have been removed from the
 
00:43:53.910 --> 00:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
telephone companies over the years from
 
00:43:55.349 --> 00:43:55.359 align:start position:0%
back when they were very heavily
 
00:43:58.069 --> 00:43:58.079 align:start position:0%
regulated but as to that particular one
 
00:43:59.589 --> 00:43:59.599 align:start position:0%
um you know maybe there's someone that
 
00:44:01.190 --> 00:44:01.200 align:start position:0%
represents the utilities or one of the
 
00:44:02.630 --> 00:44:02.640 align:start position:0%
companies that could answer the question
 
00:44:05.589 --> 00:44:05.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:05.599 --> 00:44:06.829 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:44:06.829 --> 00:44:06.839 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:44:09.270 --> 00:44:09.280 align:start position:0%
oxenam thank you very much mr chair for
 
00:44:11.349 --> 00:44:11.359 align:start position:0%
taking my question i think this is
 
00:44:13.349 --> 00:44:13.359 align:start position:0%
exactly the reason why we need interim
 
00:44:15.990 --> 00:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
study this is a vital point on which we
 
00:44:18.390 --> 00:44:18.400 align:start position:0%
have differing uh
 
00:44:21.589 --> 00:44:21.599 align:start position:0%
memories of what was said or not said at
 
00:44:23.109 --> 00:44:23.119 align:start position:0%
the the issue came up at the public
 
00:44:25.510 --> 00:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
hearing but it was not resolved i was
 
00:44:27.109 --> 00:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
not able to resolve it in the research
 
00:44:29.750 --> 00:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
that i did outside of the committee and
 
00:44:31.990 --> 00:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
i am left with the impression that in
 
00:44:34.390 --> 00:44:34.400 align:start position:0%
fact yes that's exactly what will happen
 
00:44:36.950 --> 00:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
there will be no coverage if this bill
 
00:44:41.349 --> 00:44:41.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:41.359 --> 00:44:42.550 align:start position:0%

00:44:48.309 --> 00:44:48.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um just to follow
 
00:44:51.270 --> 00:44:51.280 align:start position:0%
on that last point my question was
 
00:44:53.270 --> 00:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
if if
 
00:44:55.190 --> 00:44:55.200 align:start position:0%
if the carriers are still required to
 
00:44:57.829 --> 00:44:57.839 align:start position:0%
provide service or there needs to be an
 
00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
alternative service then why are we
 
00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:01.990 align:start position:0%
alternative service then why are we
removing

00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
removing
 
00:45:04.150 --> 00:45:04.160 align:start position:0%
carrier of last resort coverage in the
 
00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:06.400 align:start position:0%
first place who who does it benefit and
 
00:45:07.589 --> 00:45:07.599 align:start position:0%
who does it
 
00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
uh no longer benefit because it seems
 
00:45:11.910 --> 00:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
like that it seems like we're picking
 
00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
sides on either side of that argument
 
00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
saying this is fine that is fine but to
 
00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:18.400 align:start position:0%
representative oxenum's point we don't
 
00:45:20.390 --> 00:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
have the answers and so i think it's
 
00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:22.480 align:start position:0%
it's not responsible of us to move
 
00:45:23.589 --> 00:45:23.599 align:start position:0%
forward with something where we're
 
00:45:24.630 --> 00:45:24.640 align:start position:0%
really not
 
00:45:28.870 --> 00:45:28.880 align:start position:0%
we don't have certitude uh either way
 
00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative callie pitts
 
00:45:34.710 --> 00:45:34.720 align:start position:0%
when i first spoke i asked for some
 
00:45:36.630 --> 00:45:36.640 align:start position:0%
correction and some help or maybe some
 
00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:38.870 align:start position:0%
correction and some help or maybe some
clarification

00:45:38.870 --> 00:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
00:45:41.910 --> 00:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
there is a representative from
 
00:45:43.750 --> 00:45:43.760 align:start position:0%
the industry here
 
00:45:46.550 --> 00:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
and i wonder if they could clarify that
 
00:45:48.870 --> 00:45:48.880 align:start position:0%
one point because that seems to be the
 
00:45:51.109 --> 00:45:51.119 align:start position:0%
sticking point for a lot of people that
 
00:45:53.109 --> 00:45:53.119 align:start position:0%
we're going to leave
 
00:45:55.670 --> 00:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
people in a lurch and we won't do that
 
00:45:57.670 --> 00:45:57.680 align:start position:0%
it's not permitted
 
00:45:57.680 --> 00:45:58.470 align:start position:0%
it's not permitted
and

00:45:58.470 --> 00:45:58.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:46:00.950 --> 00:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
to my knowledge the way i think of it so
 
00:46:02.870 --> 00:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
i would ask your indulgence would you
 
00:46:05.910 --> 00:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
allow miss rosenberger to clarify that
 
00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:08.470 align:start position:0%
allow miss rosenberger to clarify that
position

00:46:08.470 --> 00:46:08.480 align:start position:0%
position
 
00:46:10.790 --> 00:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
i would allow it if ms rosenberger is so
 
00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:13.510 align:start position:0%
i would allow it if ms rosenberger is so
inclined

00:46:13.510 --> 00:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:14.950 --> 00:46:14.960 align:start position:0%
if you would please come up and sit at
 
00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:16.640 align:start position:0%
the table and turn on the microphone
 
00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:26.069 --> 00:46:26.079 align:start position:0%
teresa rosenberger bernstein sure i
 
00:46:27.829 --> 00:46:27.839 align:start position:0%
represent the new hampshire telephone
 
00:46:29.990 --> 00:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
association which are all the landline
 
00:46:32.150 --> 00:46:32.160 align:start position:0%

dunbarton and it used to be dixville
 
00:46:45.670 --> 00:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
and to your point
 
00:46:48.470 --> 00:46:48.480 align:start position:0%
when the balsams is and i think i
 
00:46:50.710 --> 00:46:50.720 align:start position:0%
explained this during the hearing when
 
00:46:53.349 --> 00:46:53.359 align:start position:0%
the balsams was running dixville
 
00:46:56.710 --> 00:46:56.720 align:start position:0%
telephone had a lot of customers and
 
00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:00.160 align:start position:0%
after the balsams closed at one point
 
00:47:03.190 --> 00:47:03.200 align:start position:0%
dixville telephone had five customers
 
00:47:05.510 --> 00:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
it's extraordinarily expensive to
 
00:47:07.910 --> 00:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
maintain a
 
00:47:10.870 --> 00:47:10.880 align:start position:0%
operation for five customers
 
00:47:14.710 --> 00:47:14.720 align:start position:0%
dixie telephone asked to be relieved of
 
00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:16.470 align:start position:0%
dixie telephone asked to be relieved of
their

00:47:16.470 --> 00:47:16.480 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:47:19.109 --> 00:47:19.119 align:start position:0%
obligation to serve
 
00:47:22.150 --> 00:47:22.160 align:start position:0%
that area it took us
 
00:47:23.750 --> 00:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
at least four years and it may have
 
00:47:26.710 --> 00:47:26.720 align:start position:0%
taken longer than that we had to and i
 
00:47:28.710 --> 00:47:28.720 align:start position:0%
represented dixville telephone and my
 
00:47:30.390 --> 00:47:30.400 align:start position:0%
law firm represented them in the whole
 
00:47:33.670 --> 00:47:33.680 align:start position:0%
process we had to get puc approval we
 
00:47:35.829 --> 00:47:35.839 align:start position:0%
had to get fcc approval but more
 
00:47:35.839 --> 00:47:37.589 align:start position:0%
had to get fcc approval but more
importantly

00:47:37.589 --> 00:47:37.599 align:start position:0%
importantly
 
00:47:40.549 --> 00:47:40.559 align:start position:0%
before we could do that step at all we
 
00:47:44.309 --> 00:47:44.319 align:start position:0%
had to run all sorts of tests and assure
 
00:47:47.750 --> 00:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
that every single customer that we had
 
00:47:50.390 --> 00:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
had service and they could get service
 
00:47:52.790 --> 00:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
from someone else whether it be
 
00:47:56.470 --> 00:47:56.480 align:start position:0%
wireless whether it be cable etc so and
 
00:47:59.109 --> 00:47:59.119 align:start position:0%
then on top of that and i'm sorry kate
 
00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:00.800 align:start position:0%
bailey isn't still a commissioner
 
00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:01.670 align:start position:0%
bailey isn't still a commissioner
because

00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:48:03.990 --> 00:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
we had quite a conversation about it
 
00:48:07.109 --> 00:48:07.119 align:start position:0%
because we had to not only make sure
 
00:48:07.119 --> 00:48:08.150 align:start position:0%
because we had to not only make sure
that

00:48:08.150 --> 00:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:48:09.829 --> 00:48:09.839 align:start position:0%
they had
 
00:48:11.670 --> 00:48:11.680 align:start position:0%
alternative service and they had more
 
00:48:14.150 --> 00:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
than one choice but we had to also
 
00:48:15.829 --> 00:48:15.839 align:start position:0%
assure that they wanted to take the
 
00:48:18.069 --> 00:48:18.079 align:start position:0%
service and there was one gentleman who
 
00:48:20.790 --> 00:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
i will not name his name who
 
00:48:23.270 --> 00:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
really didn't like one of the other
 
00:48:25.589 --> 00:48:25.599 align:start position:0%
carriers and and said nope not approving
 
00:48:27.829 --> 00:48:27.839 align:start position:0%
because i don't like that carrier so
 
00:48:30.150 --> 00:48:30.160 align:start position:0%
anyway eventually he
 
00:48:33.270 --> 00:48:33.280 align:start position:0%
he found a carrier he liked but we could
 
00:48:36.549 --> 00:48:36.559 align:start position:0%
not give up a service in that territory
 
00:48:38.470 --> 00:48:38.480 align:start position:0%
or we could not be approved to give it
 
00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
up without puc and fcc approval and it
 
00:48:43.750 --> 00:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
was very costly it took quite quite a
 
00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:45.510 align:start position:0%
was very costly it took quite quite a
while

00:48:45.510 --> 00:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
while
 
00:48:48.390 --> 00:48:48.400 align:start position:0%
thank you i would like to or thank you i
 
00:48:50.549 --> 00:48:50.559 align:start position:0%
would like to restrict this line of
 
00:48:53.510 --> 00:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
questioning to that one question
 
00:48:55.750 --> 00:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
uh so thank you ms rosenberger i
 
00:48:57.990 --> 00:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate that
 
00:49:00.309 --> 00:49:00.319 align:start position:0%
representative oxendum do
 
00:49:01.670 --> 00:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
thank you very much wait a minute for
 
00:49:03.990 --> 00:49:04.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question but no i just want to
 
00:49:05.510 --> 00:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
i want to say one thing
 
00:49:08.750 --> 00:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
that applies to all the mob elk all the
 
00:49:10.870 --> 00:49:10.880 align:start position:0%
monopolistic companies not just
 
00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
dicksville so if consolidated wanted to
 
00:49:15.270 --> 00:49:15.280 align:start position:0%
go out of business or granite state or
 
00:49:16.470 --> 00:49:16.480 align:start position:0%
whoever they'd have to go through the
 
00:49:18.950 --> 00:49:18.960 align:start position:0%
same process great okay thank you my
 
00:49:21.829 --> 00:49:21.839 align:start position:0%
question is that was the law
 
00:49:24.470 --> 00:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
before this change came into being the
 
00:49:25.670 --> 00:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
question is
 
00:49:28.829 --> 00:49:28.839 align:start position:0%
this bill will change that
 
00:49:31.990 --> 00:49:32.000 align:start position:0%
law after passage of this will that
 
00:49:34.470 --> 00:49:34.480 align:start position:0%
still be that will still be the case
 
00:49:36.069 --> 00:49:36.079 align:start position:0%
it what what is the where is the
 
00:49:38.710 --> 00:49:38.720 align:start position:0%
requirement it's in the law and it's in
 
00:49:42.390 --> 00:49:42.400 align:start position:0%
the federal law and the state law
 
00:49:44.150 --> 00:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
it's current we're not we're not
 
00:49:46.870 --> 00:49:46.880 align:start position:0%
changing this is not changing the
 
00:49:49.950 --> 00:49:49.960 align:start position:0%
deregulation statute that we passed what
 
00:49:52.150 --> 00:49:52.160 align:start position:0%
2012 maybe
 
00:49:54.069 --> 00:49:54.079 align:start position:0%
so the current law
 
00:49:56.790 --> 00:49:56.800 align:start position:0%
if let's just say for example
 
00:49:58.470 --> 00:49:58.480 align:start position:0%
dunbarton telephone
 
00:50:00.390 --> 00:50:00.400 align:start position:0%
asked to give up their carry of last
 
00:50:02.870 --> 00:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
resort because their their service area
 
00:50:05.670 --> 00:50:05.680 align:start position:0%
was totally covered
 
00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:06.630 align:start position:0%
was totally covered
fine

00:50:06.630 --> 00:50:06.640 align:start position:0%
fine
 
00:50:08.069 --> 00:50:08.079 align:start position:0%
they can give up the carry of last
 
00:50:11.430 --> 00:50:11.440 align:start position:0%
resort if the puc agrees they have 95
 
00:50:12.710 --> 00:50:12.720 align:start position:0%
and 75.
 
00:50:15.670 --> 00:50:15.680 align:start position:0%
dunbarton telephone cannot give up being
 
00:50:18.069 --> 00:50:18.079 align:start position:0%
a telephone company
 
00:50:21.510 --> 00:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
in their service territory without puc
 
00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
and fcc approval
 
00:50:26.069 --> 00:50:26.079 align:start position:0%
this has nothing to do with that law yes
 
00:50:28.230 --> 00:50:28.240 align:start position:0%
but but you preface your remarks by
 
00:50:30.150 --> 00:50:30.160 align:start position:0%
saying representative
 
00:50:31.750 --> 00:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
i didn't give you permission to follow
 
00:50:34.470 --> 00:50:34.480 align:start position:0%
up could you uh mr chair
 
00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
ask to be recognized please point of
 
00:50:37.030 --> 00:50:37.040 align:start position:0%
order please
 
00:50:39.349 --> 00:50:39.359 align:start position:0%
yes representative thomas yes i'd like
 
00:50:41.510 --> 00:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
to remind the committee here as much as
 
00:50:43.670 --> 00:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
they like to to respect the cheers
 
00:50:47.190 --> 00:50:47.200 align:start position:0%
ruling on issues or or challenge and
 
00:50:49.910 --> 00:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
call a vote please respect the decorum
 
00:50:51.349 --> 00:50:51.359 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:50:52.710 --> 00:50:52.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:50:54.390 --> 00:50:54.400 align:start position:0%
representative oxenam
 
00:50:57.430 --> 00:50:57.440 align:start position:0%
do you have a final comment on this bill
 
00:51:00.150 --> 00:51:00.160 align:start position:0%
yes sir thank you very much and uh thank
 
00:51:02.710 --> 00:51:02.720 align:start position:0%
you representative thomas we all
 
00:51:06.829 --> 00:51:06.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:06.839 --> 00:51:08.470 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:51:08.470 --> 00:51:08.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:10.710 --> 00:51:10.720 align:start position:0%
the final remarks were prefaced by the
 
00:51:13.430 --> 00:51:13.440 align:start position:0%
words under current law this this is the
 
00:51:15.270 --> 00:51:15.280 align:start position:0%
nub of the issue
 
00:51:17.190 --> 00:51:17.200 align:start position:0%
will this bill
 
00:51:20.230 --> 00:51:20.240 align:start position:0%
make things different and i i believe
 
00:51:23.270 --> 00:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
what we heard prior to that last
 
00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:24.390 align:start position:0%
what we heard prior to that last
edition

00:51:24.390 --> 00:51:24.400 align:start position:0%
edition
 
00:51:26.470 --> 00:51:26.480 align:start position:0%
was that there are other there are other
 
00:51:28.309 --> 00:51:28.319 align:start position:0%
laws that provide
 
00:51:29.990 --> 00:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
for this coverage
 
00:51:33.190 --> 00:51:33.200 align:start position:0%
to remain universal it so my question is
 
00:51:34.790 --> 00:51:34.800 align:start position:0%
is that your understanding of the
 
00:51:36.950 --> 00:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
remarks that we heard because it seemed
 
00:51:39.190 --> 00:51:39.200 align:start position:0%
to be contradicted in the very last
 
00:51:41.109 --> 00:51:41.119 align:start position:0%
remarks which were prefaced by the words
 
00:51:43.270 --> 00:51:43.280 align:start position:0%
under current law
 
00:51:47.109 --> 00:51:47.119 align:start position:0%
the question is what will this bill do
 
00:51:48.630 --> 00:51:48.640 align:start position:0%
representative harrington can you
 
00:51:51.109 --> 00:51:51.119 align:start position:0%
address that question
 
00:51:52.710 --> 00:51:52.720 align:start position:0%
i don't have an exact copy of the bill
 
00:51:54.069 --> 00:51:54.079 align:start position:0%
in front of me right here i'll have to
 
00:51:59.589 --> 00:51:59.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:02.390 --> 00:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
my understanding is if the criteria are
 
00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:03.270 align:start position:0%
my understanding is if the criteria are
met

00:52:03.270 --> 00:52:03.280 align:start position:0%
met
 
00:52:05.829 --> 00:52:05.839 align:start position:0%
then they will um
 
00:52:07.990 --> 00:52:08.000 align:start position:0%
they will lose they will no longer be
 
00:52:09.589 --> 00:52:09.599 align:start position:0%
required to be the supplier of last
 
00:52:13.270 --> 00:52:13.280 align:start position:0%
resort so that that's the 95 97 and
 
00:52:15.910 --> 00:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
again i bring this up as
 
00:52:18.150 --> 00:52:18.160 align:start position:0%
it's ongoing has been in maine in
 
00:52:20.470 --> 00:52:20.480 align:start position:0%
vermont for the last six years 38 states
 
00:52:22.069 --> 00:52:22.079 align:start position:0%
have similar laws there haven't been
 
00:52:24.710 --> 00:52:24.720 align:start position:0%
problems there the amount of uh
 
00:52:27.670 --> 00:52:27.680 align:start position:0%
opportunities uh for different options i
 
00:52:29.190 --> 00:52:29.200 align:start position:0%
should say for different types of
 
00:52:31.430 --> 00:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
telephone service and broadband service
 
00:52:34.309 --> 00:52:34.319 align:start position:0%
are only going up they're not going down
 
00:52:36.549 --> 00:52:36.559 align:start position:0%
so i just think this is a holdover from
 
00:52:39.109 --> 00:52:39.119 align:start position:0%
the days of long past that we don't need
 
00:52:39.119 --> 00:52:41.349 align:start position:0%
the days of long past that we don't need
anymore

00:52:41.349 --> 00:52:41.359 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
00:52:43.349 --> 00:52:43.359 align:start position:0%
all right representative christian give
 
00:52:46.790 --> 00:52:46.800 align:start position:0%
you the last word
 
00:52:48.790 --> 00:52:48.800 align:start position:0%
i guess maybe a question for
 
00:52:50.630 --> 00:52:50.640 align:start position:0%
representative harrington
 
00:52:52.390 --> 00:52:52.400 align:start position:0%
it sounds like from what we just heard
 
00:52:53.670 --> 00:52:53.680 align:start position:0%
that this is
 
00:52:55.750 --> 00:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
kind of already
 
00:52:57.829 --> 00:52:57.839 align:start position:0%
addressable that they can already
 
00:52:59.510 --> 00:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
petition the puc so i guess i don't
 
00:53:02.150 --> 00:53:02.160 align:start position:0%
understand the need for this change if
 
00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:02.950 align:start position:0%
understand the need for this change if
it

00:53:02.950 --> 00:53:02.960 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:53:04.549 --> 00:53:04.559 align:start position:0%
is already something that they can ask
 
00:53:04.559 --> 00:53:05.910 align:start position:0%
is already something that they can ask
for

00:53:05.910 --> 00:53:05.920 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:53:07.430 --> 00:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
my understanding is they still would
 
00:53:09.510 --> 00:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
have with the franchise you
 
00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
franchise comes that carrier of last
 
00:53:13.589 --> 00:53:13.599 align:start position:0%
resort requirement this would remove
 
00:53:15.910 --> 00:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
that so we basically be lying on the
 
00:53:18.309 --> 00:53:18.319 align:start position:0%
market to supply telephones and as i
 
00:53:21.190 --> 00:53:21.200 align:start position:0%
said earlier there's not been a shortage
 
00:53:23.270 --> 00:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
of it going down i don't know of any
 
00:53:24.870 --> 00:53:24.880 align:start position:0%
place that says boy we had much better
 
00:53:27.109 --> 00:53:27.119 align:start position:0%
telephone coverage much better broadband
 
00:53:29.190 --> 00:53:29.200 align:start position:0%
coverage must be wireless coverage 20
 
00:53:31.270 --> 00:53:31.280 align:start position:0%
years ago than we have now every place
 
00:53:33.270 --> 00:53:33.280 align:start position:0%
you go there's there's more options not
 
00:53:35.190 --> 00:53:35.200 align:start position:0%
less so i just don't think it's it's a
 
00:53:38.230 --> 00:53:38.240 align:start position:0%
problem that doesn't exist
 
00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:39.190 align:start position:0%
problem that doesn't exist
okay

00:53:39.190 --> 00:53:39.200 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:53:41.190 --> 00:53:41.200 align:start position:0%
i think we've
 
00:53:44.309 --> 00:53:44.319 align:start position:0%
exhausted discussion on this topic so we
 
00:53:46.630 --> 00:53:46.640 align:start position:0%
have a motion on the floor to
 
00:53:47.910 --> 00:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
move that
 
00:53:51.750 --> 00:53:51.760 align:start position:0%
hb 1328 be judged ought to pass and i'd
 
00:53:53.670 --> 00:53:53.680 align:start position:0%
ask the clerk to call the roll
 
00:53:56.710 --> 00:53:56.720 align:start position:0%

yes representative occidental i'm afraid
 
00:56:20.789 --> 00:56:20.799 align:start position:0%
i cannot do it by the close of business
 
00:56:23.190 --> 00:56:23.200 align:start position:0%
today i have several blurbs for for
 
00:56:25.589 --> 00:56:25.599 align:start position:0%
other bills that and i i don't
 
00:56:25.599 --> 00:56:26.470 align:start position:0%
other bills that and i i don't
that's

00:56:26.470 --> 00:56:26.480 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:56:28.069 --> 00:56:28.079 align:start position:0%
all right would you like to assign it to
 
00:56:29.990 --> 00:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
someone else i would i would like to
 
00:56:31.270 --> 00:56:31.280 align:start position:0%
have a little more time is there a
 
00:56:33.910 --> 00:56:33.920 align:start position:0%
reason why they need to be in today
 
00:56:36.150 --> 00:56:36.160 align:start position:0%
yes they have to be to the clerk by noon
 
00:56:38.230 --> 00:56:38.240 align:start position:0%
on wednesday we're trying to get this in
 
00:56:46.870 --> 00:56:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:48.950 --> 00:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
no that's too late because i have to
 
00:56:51.750 --> 00:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
approve all the reports before they are
 
00:56:53.910 --> 00:56:53.920 align:start position:0%
submitted to the clerk so
 
00:56:55.510 --> 00:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
we have to get them submitted to our
 
00:56:58.309 --> 00:56:58.319 align:start position:0%
leadership before they go to you and and
 
00:57:00.230 --> 00:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
who depending on how long we're here
 
00:57:03.030 --> 00:57:03.040 align:start position:0%
today i i think it's unreasonable we're
 
00:57:04.950 --> 00:57:04.960 align:start position:0%
going to be meeting march i believe it's
 
00:57:07.109 --> 00:57:07.119 align:start position:0%
march 17th and 18th with the possibility
 
00:57:10.069 --> 00:57:10.079 align:start position:0%
of the 31st
 
00:57:13.190 --> 00:57:13.200 align:start position:0%

relative to prohibiting government
 
00:57:48.150 --> 00:57:48.160 align:start position:0%
entities subordinate to the state
 
00:57:50.069 --> 00:57:50.079 align:start position:0%
from restricting the types of fuel
 
00:57:54.630 --> 00:57:54.640 align:start position:0%
sources that may be used for energy
 
00:57:56.710 --> 00:57:56.720 align:start position:0%
and the chair recognizes representative
 
00:57:59.510 --> 00:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
plett yes thank you mr chair i move out
 
00:58:02.470 --> 00:58:02.480 align:start position:0%
to pass on house bill 1148
 
00:58:05.510 --> 00:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
representative blaget is recognized
 
00:58:08.069 --> 00:58:08.079 align:start position:0%
yes thank you chair i'd like to second
 
00:58:10.870 --> 00:58:10.880 align:start position:0%
the motion ought to pass around 11 48.
 
00:58:14.390 --> 00:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
it's been moved and seconded that we
 
00:58:17.190 --> 00:58:17.200 align:start position:0%
judge house bill 1148
 
00:58:19.670 --> 00:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
should be ought to pass is there any
 
00:58:22.150 --> 00:58:22.160 align:start position:0%
discussion representative platt yes this
 
00:58:23.829 --> 00:58:23.839 align:start position:0%
is an extension of what something was
 
00:58:25.829 --> 00:58:25.839 align:start position:0%
done last year for heating systems this
 
00:58:25.839 --> 00:58:26.470 align:start position:0%
done last year for heating systems this
is

00:58:26.470 --> 00:58:26.480 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:58:29.109 --> 00:58:29.119 align:start position:0%
extending beyond heating systems to fuel
 
00:58:30.789 --> 00:58:30.799 align:start position:0%
sources for
 
00:58:33.109 --> 00:58:33.119 align:start position:0%
generation or conversion
 
00:58:35.990 --> 00:58:36.000 align:start position:0%
and a town is or municipality is still
 
00:58:37.670 --> 00:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
able to go to a site evaluation
 
00:58:41.030 --> 00:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
committee and either support or oppose
 
00:58:43.589 --> 00:58:43.599 align:start position:0%
and but they are not
 
00:58:44.950 --> 00:58:44.960 align:start position:0%
this would
 
00:58:47.190 --> 00:58:47.200 align:start position:0%
this would take away the
 
00:58:49.109 --> 00:58:49.119 align:start position:0%
power to
 
00:58:51.510 --> 00:58:51.520 align:start position:0%
change zoning just to defeat a project
 
00:58:53.990 --> 00:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh projects have to follow zoning but
 
00:58:56.309 --> 00:58:56.319 align:start position:0%
the town municipality can't throw throw
 
00:58:58.549 --> 00:58:58.559 align:start position:0%
in a monkey wrench by changing zoning or
 
00:58:59.990 --> 00:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
doing any other
 
00:59:02.069 --> 00:59:02.079 align:start position:0%
action other than protests at the site
 
00:59:03.750 --> 00:59:03.760 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee
 
00:59:07.349 --> 00:59:07.359 align:start position:0%
and it is not directed at any one
 
00:59:10.069 --> 00:59:10.079 align:start position:0%
generation source or conversion about
 
00:59:15.430 --> 00:59:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:17.670 --> 00:59:17.680 align:start position:0%
okay further discussion on this bill
 
00:59:19.829 --> 00:59:19.839 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee
 
00:59:21.430 --> 00:59:21.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:59:23.670 --> 00:59:23.680 align:start position:0%
um you know my impressions when i looked
 
00:59:25.670 --> 00:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
at this bill initially are that this
 
00:59:25.680 --> 00:59:26.789 align:start position:0%
at this bill initially are that this
will

00:59:26.789 --> 00:59:26.799 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:59:29.190 --> 00:59:29.200 align:start position:0%
affect local control yes
 
00:59:32.630 --> 00:59:32.640 align:start position:0%
uh it will also it could potentially
 
00:59:34.230 --> 00:59:34.240 align:start position:0%
interfere with
 
00:59:36.069 --> 00:59:36.079 align:start position:0%
town planning that has already been
 
00:59:36.079 --> 00:59:37.270 align:start position:0%
town planning that has already been
undertaken

00:59:37.270 --> 00:59:37.280 align:start position:0%
undertaken
 
00:59:37.280 --> 00:59:38.230 align:start position:0%
undertaken
for

00:59:38.230 --> 00:59:38.240 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:59:39.990 --> 00:59:40.000 align:start position:0%
locations that are trying to get
 
00:59:42.390 --> 00:59:42.400 align:start position:0%
themselves to 100 renewable for their
 
00:59:44.390 --> 00:59:44.400 align:start position:0%
municipal buildings and there are
 
00:59:46.230 --> 00:59:46.240 align:start position:0%
several examples of those types of towns
 
00:59:49.109 --> 00:59:49.119 align:start position:0%
that have those types of plans
 
00:59:50.309 --> 00:59:50.319 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:59:51.270 --> 00:59:51.280 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:59:51.280 --> 00:59:52.390 align:start position:0%
i think
it's

00:59:52.390 --> 00:59:52.400 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:59:54.630 --> 00:59:54.640 align:start position:0%
it's really reaching into local control
 
00:59:56.870 --> 00:59:56.880 align:start position:0%
to solve a problem that isn't there and
 
00:59:58.230 --> 00:59:58.240 align:start position:0%
the decisions that folks are making
 
00:59:58.240 --> 01:00:00.150 align:start position:0%
the decisions that folks are making
locally

01:00:00.150 --> 01:00:00.160 align:start position:0%
locally
 
01:00:01.750 --> 01:00:01.760 align:start position:0%
are not inhibiting
 
01:00:04.870 --> 01:00:04.880 align:start position:0%
the growth of any particular type of
 
01:00:06.390 --> 01:00:06.400 align:start position:0%
fuel and so
 
01:00:10.230 --> 01:00:10.240 align:start position:0%
i i would question the need for us to
 
01:00:13.910 --> 01:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
impose more limits on the local control
 
01:00:15.670 --> 01:00:15.680 align:start position:0%
for how people plan their own energy
 
01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:18.309 align:start position:0%
for how people plan their own energy
futures

01:00:18.309 --> 01:00:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:20.309 --> 01:00:20.319 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
01:00:20.319 --> 01:00:22.710 align:start position:0%
further discussion
here

01:00:22.710 --> 01:00:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:24.309 --> 01:00:24.319 align:start position:0%
representative mann
 
01:00:26.150 --> 01:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to
 
01:00:28.069 --> 01:00:28.079 align:start position:0%
point out that the city of keene for
 
01:00:31.349 --> 01:00:31.359 align:start position:0%
example sits in kind of a hollow
 
01:00:35.349 --> 01:00:35.359 align:start position:0%
and on with people burning wood um
 
01:00:37.750 --> 01:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
it gets pretty nasty
 
01:00:39.270 --> 01:00:39.280 align:start position:0%
and i think the
 
01:00:42.150 --> 01:00:42.160 align:start position:0%
city of cane should have the right to
 
01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:43.829 align:start position:0%
city of cane should have the right to
restrict

01:00:43.829 --> 01:00:43.839 align:start position:0%
restrict
 
01:00:45.990 --> 01:00:46.000 align:start position:0%
fuel sources for heating
 
01:00:49.270 --> 01:00:49.280 align:start position:0%
simply on that basis for public health
 
01:00:51.430 --> 01:00:51.440 align:start position:0%
and so that's an example of public
 
01:00:54.789 --> 01:00:54.799 align:start position:0%
health in general and
 
01:01:01.109 --> 01:01:01.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:01.119 --> 01:01:04.630 align:start position:0%
 
considered

01:01:04.630 --> 01:01:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:06.950 --> 01:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative platt i
 
01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:08.150 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative platt i
remind

01:01:08.150 --> 01:01:08.160 align:start position:0%
remind
 
01:01:09.510 --> 01:01:09.520 align:start position:0%
representative mann that this is
 
01:01:11.910 --> 01:01:11.920 align:start position:0%
directed towards energy generation or
 
01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:13.109 align:start position:0%
directed towards energy generation or
conversion

01:01:13.109 --> 01:01:13.119 align:start position:0%
conversion
 
01:01:15.510 --> 01:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
uh what he was his example he used was
 
01:01:17.270 --> 01:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
heating and that was made illegal last
 
01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:19.829 align:start position:0%
heating and that was made illegal last
year

01:01:19.829 --> 01:01:19.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:21.750 --> 01:01:21.760 align:start position:0%
okay representative callie pitts has a
 
01:01:24.309 --> 01:01:24.319 align:start position:0%
question i'd just like to remind the
 
01:01:25.829 --> 01:01:25.839 align:start position:0%
committee that
 
01:01:28.150 --> 01:01:28.160 align:start position:0%
it was said that the uh
 
01:01:30.150 --> 01:01:30.160 align:start position:0%
they could be an appeal will appeals go
 
01:01:31.510 --> 01:01:31.520 align:start position:0%
both ways
 
01:01:33.589 --> 01:01:33.599 align:start position:0%
the generator can appeal as well as the
 
01:01:35.670 --> 01:01:35.680 align:start position:0%
town so we you know
 
01:01:37.589 --> 01:01:37.599 align:start position:0%
i think we shouldn't make a law to
 
01:01:39.270 --> 01:01:39.280 align:start position:0%
prohibit that
 
01:01:41.589 --> 01:01:41.599 align:start position:0%
and i think we need to leave it the way
 
01:01:44.230 --> 01:01:44.240 align:start position:0%
it is there are a lot of
 
01:01:46.390 --> 01:01:46.400 align:start position:0%
plants that are closing and
 
01:01:49.990 --> 01:01:50.000 align:start position:0%
things that may be coming in and if we
 
01:01:53.190 --> 01:01:53.200 align:start position:0%
hold planning boards or
 
01:01:56.309 --> 01:01:56.319 align:start position:0%
boards of adjustment or zoning boards
 
01:01:56.319 --> 01:01:58.150 align:start position:0%
boards of adjustment or zoning boards
as

01:01:58.150 --> 01:01:58.160 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:02:00.309 --> 01:02:00.319 align:start position:0%
the virgin mary we're wrong they change
 
01:02:02.950 --> 01:02:02.960 align:start position:0%
zoning all the time but i think that
 
01:02:05.190 --> 01:02:05.200 align:start position:0%
energy needs to be a consideration and
 
01:02:07.430 --> 01:02:07.440 align:start position:0%
the type of energy
 
01:02:11.430 --> 01:02:11.440 align:start position:0%
what your neighbors are breathing
 
01:02:13.990 --> 01:02:14.000 align:start position:0%
is extremely important not only to the
 
01:02:15.430 --> 01:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
health of the town
 
01:02:19.190 --> 01:02:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:20.789 --> 01:02:20.799 align:start position:0%
thank you representative callie pitts
 
01:02:22.789 --> 01:02:22.799 align:start position:0%
i'd remind the members of the committee
 
01:02:22.799 --> 01:02:23.589 align:start position:0%
i'd remind the members of the committee
that

01:02:23.589 --> 01:02:23.599 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:02:25.910 --> 01:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is not a home rule state
 
01:02:28.549 --> 01:02:28.559 align:start position:0%
and local municipalities local
 
01:02:30.789 --> 01:02:30.799 align:start position:0%
governments can only do
 
01:02:32.829 --> 01:02:32.839 align:start position:0%
what the state gives them permission to
 
01:02:36.870 --> 01:02:36.880 align:start position:0%
do and that's where this bill would fall
 
01:02:39.270 --> 01:02:39.280 align:start position:0%
into that category this the state would
 
01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:40.069 align:start position:0%
into that category this the state would
be

01:02:40.069 --> 01:02:40.079 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:02:42.549 --> 01:02:42.559 align:start position:0%
saying no to permission to
 
01:02:45.430 --> 01:02:45.440 align:start position:0%
uh prohibiting any kind of fuel use
 
01:02:48.150 --> 01:02:48.160 align:start position:0%
representative sykes had a comment
 
01:02:50.230 --> 01:02:50.240 align:start position:0%
actually i have a question not a comment
 
01:02:51.750 --> 01:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:53.589 align:start position:0%
mr chair
um

01:02:53.589 --> 01:02:53.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:55.990 --> 01:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
do i understand correctly that part two
 
01:02:57.670 --> 01:02:57.680 align:start position:0%
of this bill
 
01:03:02.390 --> 01:03:02.400 align:start position:0%
which in in lines 14 15 and and 16 would
 
01:03:05.349 --> 01:03:05.359 align:start position:0%
make zoning changes that a community had
 
01:03:08.150 --> 01:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
made in prior years
 
01:03:11.430 --> 01:03:11.440 align:start position:0%
void now if it concerns municipal energy
 
01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:15.589 align:start position:0%
void now if it concerns municipal energy
questions

01:03:15.589 --> 01:03:15.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:17.430 --> 01:03:17.440 align:start position:0%
i'll let representative plett answer
 
01:03:20.549 --> 01:03:20.559 align:start position:0%
that question that is correct
 
01:03:23.349 --> 01:03:23.359 align:start position:0%
wow okay further discussion
 
01:03:27.750 --> 01:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:28.870 --> 01:03:28.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for taking the
 
01:03:31.829 --> 01:03:31.839 align:start position:0%
question mr chair i'm very concerned
 
01:03:33.950 --> 01:03:33.960 align:start position:0%
that part two is
 
01:03:36.549 --> 01:03:36.559 align:start position:0%
retroactively changing
 
01:03:38.950 --> 01:03:38.960 align:start position:0%
laws that had been passed
 
01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:40.470 align:start position:0%
laws that had been passed
by

01:03:40.470 --> 01:03:40.480 align:start position:0%
by
 
01:03:42.549 --> 01:03:42.559 align:start position:0%
our towns and our
 
01:03:45.029 --> 01:03:45.039 align:start position:0%
unincorporated places
 
01:03:47.190 --> 01:03:47.200 align:start position:0%
that that we have
 
01:03:49.990 --> 01:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
had many towns i believe the numbers in
 
01:03:52.630 --> 01:03:52.640 align:start position:0%
excess of 20 who have
 
01:03:55.109 --> 01:03:55.119 align:start position:0%
designated that they want to move to 100
 
01:03:57.349 --> 01:03:57.359 align:start position:0%
renewable energy by a date certain
 
01:03:59.109 --> 01:03:59.119 align:start position:0%
they've undertaken
 
01:04:01.829 --> 01:04:01.839 align:start position:0%
investment programs they've undertaken
 
01:04:01.839 --> 01:04:03.270 align:start position:0%
investment programs they've undertaken
bonding

01:04:03.270 --> 01:04:03.280 align:start position:0%
bonding
 
01:04:06.069 --> 01:04:06.079 align:start position:0%
on the basis of the fact that this was
 
01:04:08.470 --> 01:04:08.480 align:start position:0%
within their purview i think for the
 
01:04:11.670 --> 01:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
state to step in at this point and make
 
01:04:14.150 --> 01:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
this kind of a unilateral
 
01:04:16.789 --> 01:04:16.799 align:start position:0%
declaration would be harmful to our
 
01:04:18.390 --> 01:04:18.400 align:start position:0%
local businesses
 
01:04:19.910 --> 01:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
harmful to
 
01:04:21.990 --> 01:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
our efforts to move in a different
 
01:04:23.990 --> 01:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
direction with fuel sources
 
01:04:25.829 --> 01:04:25.839 align:start position:0%
and that it would it would take us
 
01:04:29.750 --> 01:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
backwards and probably bring the uh
 
01:04:31.670 --> 01:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
i won't go into probably i i think it's
 
01:04:33.910 --> 01:04:33.920 align:start position:0%
a very bad idea and i'll be voting
 
01:04:35.910 --> 01:04:35.920 align:start position:0%
against it
 
01:04:38.710 --> 01:04:38.720 align:start position:0%
okay further discussion on this bill
 
01:04:40.549 --> 01:04:40.559 align:start position:0%
representative partial
 
01:04:42.309 --> 01:04:42.319 align:start position:0%
yes thank you chair
 
01:04:45.109 --> 01:04:45.119 align:start position:0%
in 2017 there was a
 
01:04:47.670 --> 01:04:47.680 align:start position:0%
lawsuit between liberty utilities
 
01:04:49.430 --> 01:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
and the city of concord
 
01:04:51.750 --> 01:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
um concerning some of the areas that
 
01:04:52.950 --> 01:04:52.960 align:start position:0%
this uh
 
01:04:55.270 --> 01:04:55.280 align:start position:0%
bill would address and while the court
 
01:04:56.549 --> 01:04:56.559 align:start position:0%
ultimately found in favor of the
 
01:04:58.470 --> 01:04:58.480 align:start position:0%
municipality for what
 
01:04:58.480 --> 01:04:59.750 align:start position:0%
municipality for what
uh

01:04:59.750 --> 01:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:05:02.150 --> 01:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
decisions they could make
 
01:05:04.630 --> 01:05:04.640 align:start position:0%
an understanding also we are not a uh
 
01:05:07.029 --> 01:05:07.039 align:start position:0%
home rule
 
01:05:09.270 --> 01:05:09.280 align:start position:0%
either see this as opening up as uh
 
01:05:11.270 --> 01:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
potentially opening up another reopening
 
01:05:12.789 --> 01:05:12.799 align:start position:0%
that lawsuit
 
01:05:15.589 --> 01:05:15.599 align:start position:0%
and uh for the sake of efficiency i just
 
01:05:17.510 --> 01:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
think that we should be cautious around
 
01:05:18.630 --> 01:05:18.640 align:start position:0%
these things
 
01:05:20.390 --> 01:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
which is why i
 
01:05:21.990 --> 01:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
while i'm not actually opposed to the
 
01:05:23.349 --> 01:05:23.359 align:start position:0%
bill itself
 
01:05:24.789 --> 01:05:24.799 align:start position:0%
i can't
 
01:05:28.150 --> 01:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:29.430 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:05:29.430 --> 01:05:29.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:05:31.270 --> 01:05:31.280 align:start position:0%

01:05:33.190 --> 01:05:33.200 align:start position:0%
seeing none i'll ask the clerk to call
 
01:05:35.670 --> 01:05:35.680 align:start position:0%

reading the blue sheets
 
01:07:50.069 --> 01:07:50.079 align:start position:0%
uh this is not a public hearing
 
01:07:51.270 --> 01:07:51.280 align:start position:0%

01:07:53.270 --> 01:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
hearing okay
 
01:07:57.430 --> 01:07:57.440 align:start position:0%
that's the reason we haven't been doing
 
01:07:59.270 --> 01:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
goodness gracious it's great to have a
 
01:08:08.309 --> 01:08:08.319 align:start position:0%

i'm getting requests for a bio break
 
01:08:13.750 --> 01:08:13.760 align:start position:0%

have a lunch break
 
01:08:17.349 --> 01:08:17.359 align:start position:0%

since it is now
 
01:08:23.349 --> 01:08:23.359 align:start position:0%
110 1105 i guess we're pretty close to
 
01:08:23.359 --> 01:08:24.630 align:start position:0%
110 1105 i guess we're pretty close to
it

01:08:24.630 --> 01:08:24.640 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:08:26.149 --> 01:08:26.159 align:start position:0%
i think we're going to do a lunch break
 
01:08:29.349 --> 01:08:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:31.669 --> 01:08:31.679 align:start position:0%
or at least after we do one other piece
 
01:08:32.789 --> 01:08:32.799 align:start position:0%
of business
 
01:08:34.470 --> 01:08:34.480 align:start position:0%
and that other piece of business is not
 
01:08:36.390 --> 01:08:36.400 align:start position:0%
directly related to a
 
01:08:38.709 --> 01:08:38.719 align:start position:0%
public an executive session i'm not sure
 
01:08:41.430 --> 01:08:41.440 align:start position:0%
i closed the executive session on 11 48
 
01:08:43.590 --> 01:08:43.600 align:start position:0%
so i'll do that now so that is
 
01:08:45.910 --> 01:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
officially closed and there is one other
 
01:08:47.510 --> 01:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
piece of business i would like to
 
01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:49.189 align:start position:0%
piece of business i would like to
conduct

01:08:49.189 --> 01:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
conduct
 
01:08:51.669 --> 01:08:51.679 align:start position:0%
before we
 
01:08:55.349 --> 01:08:55.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:58.309 --> 01:08:58.319 align:start position:0%
our lunch break and that is
 
01:09:00.709 --> 01:09:00.719 align:start position:0%
representative oxenam requested a work
 
01:09:04.309 --> 01:09:04.319 align:start position:0%
session on house bill 1645
 
01:09:06.550 --> 01:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
which is scheduled for
 
01:09:09.110 --> 01:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
executive session tomorrow
 
01:09:10.630 --> 01:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
so what i would like to do is i would
 
01:09:13.510 --> 01:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
like to get a sense of the committee
 
01:09:16.789 --> 01:09:16.799 align:start position:0%
about whether or not we want to hold a
 
01:09:20.950 --> 01:09:20.960 align:start position:0%
work session on house bill 1645 if we do
 
01:09:23.990 --> 01:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
then we'll schedule that
 
01:09:25.349 --> 01:09:25.359 align:start position:0%
for maybe
 
01:09:27.430 --> 01:09:27.440 align:start position:0%
one or two o'clock tomorrow afternoon
 
01:09:29.590 --> 01:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
and then have the exact exact session
 
01:09:31.590 --> 01:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
immediately following
 
01:09:34.149 --> 01:09:34.159 align:start position:0%
we have to post any work sessions 24
 
01:09:36.070 --> 01:09:36.080 align:start position:0%
hours before they
 
01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:37.110 align:start position:0%
hours before they
happen

01:09:37.110 --> 01:09:37.120 align:start position:0%
happen
 
01:09:38.630 --> 01:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
so if we're going to do this we need to
 
01:09:41.269 --> 01:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
post it outside the door here
 
01:09:44.070 --> 01:09:44.080 align:start position:0%
sooner rather than later later
 
01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:45.510 align:start position:0%
sooner rather than later later
so

01:09:45.510 --> 01:09:45.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:09:47.349 --> 01:09:47.359 align:start position:0%
i think what i would like to do is have
 
01:09:49.269 --> 01:09:49.279 align:start position:0%
a short discussion about whether or not
 
01:09:51.590 --> 01:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
we want to have this work session
 
01:09:53.269 --> 01:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
and then i'd like to take a vote of the
 
01:09:54.709 --> 01:09:54.719 align:start position:0%
committee to find out if we're going to
 
01:09:56.070 --> 01:09:56.080 align:start position:0%
do so
 
01:09:56.080 --> 01:09:58.149 align:start position:0%
do so
so

01:09:58.149 --> 01:09:58.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:10:01.110 --> 01:10:01.120 align:start position:0%
is there any discussion on this
 
01:10:03.189 --> 01:10:03.199 align:start position:0%
subject representative oxenam since it's
 
01:10:04.950 --> 01:10:04.960 align:start position:0%
your request i'll let you have the first
 
01:10:08.070 --> 01:10:08.080 align:start position:0%
word thank you very much mr chair yes uh
 
01:10:11.990 --> 01:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
it's a complex bill i have a
 
01:10:14.630 --> 01:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
handout which unlike the one i just gave
 
01:10:16.229 --> 01:10:16.239 align:start position:0%
you on a different bill was back to
 
01:10:18.950 --> 01:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
front on one page this is back to front
 
01:10:22.630 --> 01:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
on about 15 pages and i i really think
 
01:10:24.550 --> 01:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
we could we could get through it in 10
 
01:10:27.030 --> 01:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
minutes but i think it takes it takes a
 
01:10:29.110 --> 01:10:29.120 align:start position:0%
little bit of more time than we've been
 
01:10:32.310 --> 01:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
giving in our executive sessions and i i
 
01:10:35.430 --> 01:10:35.440 align:start position:0%
would ask you to please allow us the
 
01:10:38.470 --> 01:10:38.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity to present the bill so that
 
01:10:41.110 --> 01:10:41.120 align:start position:0%
it is fully understood at the time that
 
01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:41.990 align:start position:0%
it is fully understood at the time that
we

01:10:41.990 --> 01:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:10:44.550 --> 01:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
moved to a vote thank you
 
01:10:46.390 --> 01:10:46.400 align:start position:0%
okay further discussion representative
 
01:10:49.590 --> 01:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
plett i find this request very untimely
 
01:10:51.350 --> 01:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
we're in exact session today and
 
01:10:53.350 --> 01:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
tomorrow with 10 bills each we just
 
01:10:55.110 --> 01:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
haven't got the time there's plenty of
 
01:10:58.550 --> 01:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
time to ask for this earlier
 
01:10:58.560 --> 01:11:00.550 align:start position:0%
time to ask for this earlier
representative

01:11:00.550 --> 01:11:00.560 align:start position:0%

platt thank you any further discussion
 
01:11:08.390 --> 01:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:11.110 --> 01:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
i think any one of us in here could at
 
01:11:12.470 --> 01:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
any time
 
01:11:15.270 --> 01:11:15.280 align:start position:0%
make a request of the chair
 
01:11:17.030 --> 01:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
and out of deference
 
01:11:19.990 --> 01:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
and out of respect for my fellow
 
01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:21.510 align:start position:0%
and out of respect for my fellow
representative

01:11:21.510 --> 01:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:11:24.229 --> 01:11:24.239 align:start position:0%
if there's new information to be heard
 
01:11:26.870 --> 01:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
or different information to be heard
 
01:11:29.910 --> 01:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
i would vote in favor of that
 
01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:34.310 align:start position:0%
i would vote in favor of that
we

01:11:34.310 --> 01:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:37.030 --> 01:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
i understand time constraints
 
01:11:40.149 --> 01:11:40.159 align:start position:0%
but i don't think we're that constrained
 
01:11:43.189 --> 01:11:43.199 align:start position:0%
and i i really do think that in re out
 
01:11:46.310 --> 01:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:49.350 --> 01:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
i i would approve that i'm never
 
01:11:54.149 --> 01:11:54.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:56.149 --> 01:11:56.159 align:start position:0%
uh further comments on this question
 
01:11:57.590 --> 01:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
about whether we should have a work
 
01:12:00.470 --> 01:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
session tomorrow on house bill
 
01:12:03.830 --> 01:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
uh 1645 representative partial
 
01:12:05.669 --> 01:12:05.679 align:start position:0%
yes could you repeat again how long do
 
01:12:07.669 --> 01:12:07.679 align:start position:0%
you think this work session would
 
01:12:07.679 --> 01:12:09.669 align:start position:0%
you think this work session would
take

01:12:09.669 --> 01:12:09.679 align:start position:0%
take
 
01:12:12.870 --> 01:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
an estimate representative oxenam
 
01:12:15.430 --> 01:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um i'm i'm saying
 
01:12:17.430 --> 01:12:17.440 align:start position:0%
that i believe i could present this
 
01:12:19.750 --> 01:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
information in about 10
 
01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:20.950 align:start position:0%
information in about 10
minutes

01:12:20.950 --> 01:12:20.960 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:21.750 align:start position:0%
minutes
but

01:12:21.750 --> 01:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:12:23.750 --> 01:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
how long the work session where people
 
01:12:25.990 --> 01:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
might raise questions about it i think
 
01:12:28.310 --> 01:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
that i i don't believe it would be more
 
01:12:31.030 --> 01:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
than a half an hour at a maximum but
 
01:12:33.030 --> 01:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
that's i guess
 
01:12:34.709 --> 01:12:34.719 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:12:36.310 --> 01:12:36.320 align:start position:0%
further discussion on the question of
 
01:12:37.910 --> 01:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
whether we should have a work session on
 
01:12:43.030 --> 01:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:45.750 --> 01:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
personally if anyone here made a request
 
01:12:47.830 --> 01:12:47.840 align:start position:0%
for a work session i would be in favor
 
01:12:49.510 --> 01:12:49.520 align:start position:0%
of it
 
01:12:51.430 --> 01:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
01:12:53.590 --> 01:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
in deference to my colleague i think
 
01:12:56.149 --> 01:12:56.159 align:start position:0%
that it is important that
 
01:12:59.270 --> 01:12:59.280 align:start position:0%
we have we definitely have the time
 
01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:00.390 align:start position:0%
we have we definitely have the time
um

01:13:00.390 --> 01:13:00.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:02.229 --> 01:13:02.239 align:start position:0%
this is not gonna
 
01:13:04.310 --> 01:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
if that makes us stay here a half an
 
01:13:05.590 --> 01:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
hour longer
 
01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:06.550 align:start position:0%
hour longer
um

01:13:06.550 --> 01:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:09.110 --> 01:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
but we've uh done our due diligence
 
01:13:12.470 --> 01:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:15.270 --> 01:13:15.280 align:start position:0%
okay any further comment
 
01:13:17.350 --> 01:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
the reason i've asked for a vote is
 
01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:18.790 align:start position:0%
the reason i've asked for a vote is
because

01:13:18.790 --> 01:13:18.800 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:13:21.590 --> 01:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
this is a democratic body so i thought
 
01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:22.550 align:start position:0%
this is a democratic body so i thought
the

01:13:22.550 --> 01:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:13:24.790 --> 01:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
the organization the group should make
 
01:13:26.390 --> 01:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
the decision about whether to do this or
 
01:13:28.390 --> 01:13:28.400 align:start position:0%

02:33:27.910 --> 02:33:27.920 align:start position:0%
customer generators to interim study
 
02:33:30.469 --> 02:33:30.479 align:start position:0%

anything about your motion yes thank you
um

02:33:35.190 --> 02:33:35.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:33:37.510 --> 02:33:37.520 align:start position:0%
so as as i testified when i introduced
 
02:33:38.469 --> 02:33:38.479 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:33:41.030 --> 02:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh there are currently issues with it uh
 
02:33:43.190 --> 02:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
the main issue being that it regulates
 
02:33:44.870 --> 02:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
an obligation that does not exist
 
02:33:44.880 --> 02:33:46.150 align:start position:0%
an obligation that does not exist
currently

02:33:46.150 --> 02:33:46.160 align:start position:0%
currently
 
02:33:48.150 --> 02:33:48.160 align:start position:0%
um there were also concerns about how it
 
02:33:51.830 --> 02:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
might affect or uh disincentivize um
 
02:33:53.910 --> 02:33:53.920 align:start position:0%
certain types of energy uh insulation
 
02:33:55.030 --> 02:33:55.040 align:start position:0%
throughout the state there's a number of
 
02:33:57.349 --> 02:33:57.359 align:start position:0%
complex things with this bill but i do
 
02:33:59.670 --> 02:33:59.680 align:start position:0%
think there are risk factors as well as
 
02:34:01.270 --> 02:34:01.280 align:start position:0%
uh we need to look at when that
 
02:34:03.349 --> 02:34:03.359 align:start position:0%
obligation might be necessary in the
 
02:34:03.359 --> 02:34:04.309 align:start position:0%
obligation might be necessary in the
future

02:34:04.309 --> 02:34:04.319 align:start position:0%
future
 
02:34:05.429 --> 02:34:05.439 align:start position:0%
so that's why i'd like to refer to
 
02:34:07.349 --> 02:34:07.359 align:start position:0%
interrupt study
 
02:34:09.590 --> 02:34:09.600 align:start position:0%

second the motion
 
02:36:19.270 --> 02:36:19.280 align:start position:0%
it's been moved and seconded that house
 
02:36:23.190 --> 02:36:23.200 align:start position:0%
bill 1250 be judged to be itl
 
02:36:27.910 --> 02:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:29.830 --> 02:36:29.840 align:start position:0%
representative bernardi
 
02:36:29.840 --> 02:36:30.790 align:start position:0%
representative bernardi
yes

02:36:30.790 --> 02:36:30.800 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:36:30.800 --> 02:36:32.150 align:start position:0%
yes
the

02:36:32.150 --> 02:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:36:34.230 --> 02:36:34.240 align:start position:0%
public utilities commission is charged
 
02:36:36.309 --> 02:36:36.319 align:start position:0%
with setting rates that are just and
 
02:36:39.429 --> 02:36:39.439 align:start position:0%
reasonable or lawful
 
02:36:39.439 --> 02:36:40.630 align:start position:0%
reasonable or lawful
and

02:36:40.630 --> 02:36:40.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:36:42.870 --> 02:36:42.880 align:start position:0%
this is for services provided and
 
02:36:45.349 --> 02:36:45.359 align:start position:0%
observed now these are essentially
 
02:36:48.710 --> 02:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
financial criteria what's being asked is
 
02:36:51.270 --> 02:36:51.280 align:start position:0%
is that we judge in environmental
 
02:36:53.429 --> 02:36:53.439 align:start position:0%
criteria and turn them into some kind of
 
02:36:56.469 --> 02:36:56.479 align:start position:0%
financial component and uh
 
02:37:00.230 --> 02:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
and embed them in rates that's just
 
02:37:02.790 --> 02:37:02.800 align:start position:0%
an almost impossible task particularly
 
02:37:05.510 --> 02:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
as everyone has different opinion on
 
02:37:07.429 --> 02:37:07.439 align:start position:0%
what the
 
02:37:09.349 --> 02:37:09.359 align:start position:0%
issues associated with climate change
 
02:37:13.270 --> 02:37:13.280 align:start position:0%
are um they're not all bad uh
 
02:37:15.910 --> 02:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
you know increasing carbon dioxide makes
 
02:37:18.630 --> 02:37:18.640 align:start position:0%
greater green growth in in the
 
02:37:20.309 --> 02:37:20.319 align:start position:0%
countryside so
 
02:37:23.349 --> 02:37:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:23.359 --> 02:37:24.469 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:37:24.469 --> 02:37:24.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:37:25.910 --> 02:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
given the fact that it's almost
 
02:37:28.309 --> 02:37:28.319 align:start position:0%
impossible to turn environmental
 
02:37:31.590 --> 02:37:31.600 align:start position:0%
criteria into financial criteria
 
02:37:35.110 --> 02:37:35.120 align:start position:0%
this is inexpedient to legislate
 
02:37:36.389 --> 02:37:36.399 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:37:38.230 --> 02:37:38.240 align:start position:0%
representative harrington did you have a
 
02:37:38.240 --> 02:37:41.910 align:start position:0%
representative harrington did you have a
comment

02:37:41.910 --> 02:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:45.030 --> 02:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
i just said i agree with what he said
 
02:37:47.590 --> 02:37:47.600 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative platt
 
02:37:49.429 --> 02:37:49.439 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chair
 
02:37:52.550 --> 02:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
the puc doesn't run across climate at
 
02:37:54.790 --> 02:37:54.800 align:start position:0%
all in its deliberations
 
02:37:57.590 --> 02:37:57.600 align:start position:0%
uh the closest they come is very
 
02:37:59.590 --> 02:37:59.600 align:start position:0%
tangential when they approve default
 
02:38:02.230 --> 02:38:02.240 align:start position:0%
service rates but even then they have no
 
02:38:03.990 --> 02:38:04.000 align:start position:0%
idea what that where that default
 
02:38:06.389 --> 02:38:06.399 align:start position:0%
service rate is coming from because it's
 
02:38:06.399 --> 02:38:07.190 align:start position:0%
service rate is coming from because it's
it's

02:38:07.190 --> 02:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:38:10.790 --> 02:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
it's uh bid by utilities to uh to to get
 
02:38:10.800 --> 02:38:11.830 align:start position:0%
it's uh bid by utilities to uh to to get
service

02:38:11.830 --> 02:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
service
 
02:38:11.840 --> 02:38:13.030 align:start position:0%
service
and

02:38:13.030 --> 02:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:38:15.270 --> 02:38:15.280 align:start position:0%
and they don't have no idea within that
 
02:38:17.590 --> 02:38:17.600 align:start position:0%
bid what is actually going to generate
 
02:38:19.510 --> 02:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
short of that it's all distribution
 
02:38:19.520 --> 02:38:20.469 align:start position:0%
short of that it's all distribution
rates

02:38:20.469 --> 02:38:20.479 align:start position:0%
rates
 
02:38:21.590 --> 02:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
uh yeah
 
02:38:22.630 --> 02:38:22.640 align:start position:0%
and and
 
02:38:26.550 --> 02:38:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:28.870 --> 02:38:28.880 align:start position:0%
okay representative harrington
 
02:38:30.469 --> 02:38:30.479 align:start position:0%
yeah just a clarification on that i
 
02:38:32.950 --> 02:38:32.960 align:start position:0%
think by way of example we look at the
 
02:38:35.349 --> 02:38:35.359 align:start position:0%
storm we faced a couple of weeks ago
 
02:38:35.359 --> 02:38:36.389 align:start position:0%
storm we faced a couple of weeks ago
um

02:38:36.389 --> 02:38:36.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:38:39.030 --> 02:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
uh we had a um you know obviously we
 
02:38:40.870 --> 02:38:40.880 align:start position:0%
lost a lot of wind that was because it
 
02:38:43.270 --> 02:38:43.280 align:start position:0%
was too windy uh we lost all the solar
 
02:38:45.030 --> 02:38:45.040 align:start position:0%
because it was snowing out
 
02:38:47.429 --> 02:38:47.439 align:start position:0%
and on any given day there is no way
 
02:38:49.590 --> 02:38:49.600 align:start position:0%
that the utility knows where their power
 
02:38:51.190 --> 02:38:51.200 align:start position:0%
is coming from since they don't generate
 
02:38:54.309 --> 02:38:54.319 align:start position:0%
their own so on days in january we saw
 
02:38:56.630 --> 02:38:56.640 align:start position:0%
oil producing over 25 percent of the
 
02:38:58.389 --> 02:38:58.399 align:start position:0%
electricity in new england
 
02:39:01.349 --> 02:39:01.359 align:start position:0%
and most other months other than extreme
 
02:39:02.790 --> 02:39:02.800 align:start position:0%
cold ones you're probably going to see
 
02:39:05.590 --> 02:39:05.600 align:start position:0%
that number closer to zero but they
 
02:39:07.349 --> 02:39:07.359 align:start position:0%
don't have any control over it's what's
 
02:39:09.670 --> 02:39:09.680 align:start position:0%
being put on the grid due to
 
02:39:12.150 --> 02:39:12.160 align:start position:0%
all sorts of variables with supply and
 
02:39:14.230 --> 02:39:14.240 align:start position:0%
cost and pipelines and deliverables and
 
02:39:15.750 --> 02:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
everything else and this would be an
 
02:39:17.670 --> 02:39:17.680 align:start position:0%
impossible task for the puc to do
 
02:39:19.910 --> 02:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
because they simply don't know what the
 
02:39:22.389 --> 02:39:22.399 align:start position:0%
mix of power is because nobody knows
 
02:39:26.550 --> 02:39:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:28.469 --> 02:39:28.479 align:start position:0%
thank you additional discussion
 
02:39:31.510 --> 02:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
representative oxenoum
 
02:39:34.070 --> 02:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
02:39:37.910 --> 02:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
the the actual provision in the rsa
 
02:39:41.349 --> 02:39:41.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:43.750 --> 02:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
try trying to jump into this sentence in
 
02:39:45.990 --> 02:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
a way that uh doesn't make me read the
 
02:39:48.630 --> 02:39:48.640 align:start position:0%
entire paragraph to you but the just and
 
02:39:50.790 --> 02:39:50.800 align:start position:0%
reasonable was brought up whenever the
 
02:39:52.389 --> 02:39:52.399 align:start position:0%
commission shall be of the opinion after
 
02:39:53.990 --> 02:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
a hearing upon its own motion or on
 
02:39:55.270 --> 02:39:55.280 align:start position:0%
motion of the department of energy or
 
02:39:56.870 --> 02:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
upon complaint that the rate spares or
 
02:39:58.309 --> 02:39:58.319 align:start position:0%
charges demanded or collected or
 
02:40:00.230 --> 02:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
proposed to be demanded or collected by
 
02:40:01.830 --> 02:40:01.840 align:start position:0%
any public utility for service rendered
 
02:40:03.830 --> 02:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
or to be rendered or unjust or
 
02:40:03.840 --> 02:40:05.270 align:start position:0%
or to be rendered or unjust or
unreasonable

02:40:05.270 --> 02:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
unreasonable
 
02:40:08.070 --> 02:40:08.080 align:start position:0%
or that the regulations or practices of
 
02:40:10.630 --> 02:40:10.640 align:start position:0%
such public utility affecting such rates
 
02:40:13.110 --> 02:40:13.120 align:start position:0%
are unjust or unreasonable
 
02:40:13.120 --> 02:40:14.630 align:start position:0%
are unjust or unreasonable
or

02:40:14.630 --> 02:40:14.640 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:40:16.630 --> 02:40:16.640 align:start position:0%
is a violation of any provision of law
 
02:40:18.550 --> 02:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
or the maximum rate spheres or charges
 
02:40:20.550 --> 02:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
is chargeable or insufficient
 
02:40:22.389 --> 02:40:22.399 align:start position:0%
the commission shall determine the just
 
02:40:25.269 --> 02:40:25.279 align:start position:0%
and reasonable or lawful rates fares and
 
02:40:27.429 --> 02:40:27.439 align:start position:0%
charges to be thereafter observed and
 
02:40:29.269 --> 02:40:29.279 align:start position:0%
enforced as the maximum to be charged
 
02:40:31.670 --> 02:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
for the service to be performed
 
02:40:33.429 --> 02:40:33.439 align:start position:0%
and i think that covers
 
02:40:34.950 --> 02:40:34.960 align:start position:0%
that point
 
02:40:36.870 --> 02:40:36.880 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
02:40:39.750 --> 02:40:39.760 align:start position:0%
the issue here um i'm not the sponsor
 
02:40:41.510 --> 02:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
i'm the co-sponsor and so i'm speaking
 
02:40:43.429 --> 02:40:43.439 align:start position:0%
for representative gallagher so you'll
 
02:40:45.349 --> 02:40:45.359 align:start position:0%
permit me to to
 
02:40:47.670 --> 02:40:47.680 align:start position:0%
suggest what was in his mind when he
 
02:40:49.590 --> 02:40:49.600 align:start position:0%
spoke to ols
 
02:40:51.670 --> 02:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
in fact i think ols made an error in
 
02:40:53.190 --> 02:40:53.200 align:start position:0%
putting this provision into this
 
02:40:56.710 --> 02:40:56.720 align:start position:0%
particular section of 378. i think that
 
02:41:00.389 --> 02:41:00.399 align:start position:0%
378 37 and 38 would have made more sense
 
02:41:02.389 --> 02:41:02.399 align:start position:0%
and i've handed out to everyone
 
02:41:04.790 --> 02:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
an information sheet that shows
 
02:41:06.710 --> 02:41:06.720 align:start position:0%
where the
 
02:41:11.269 --> 02:41:11.279 align:start position:0%
rate setting can actually be affected so
 
02:41:13.030 --> 02:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
the main point here
 
02:41:16.469 --> 02:41:16.479 align:start position:0%
is that the pucs decisions can be
 
02:41:18.630 --> 02:41:18.640 align:start position:0%
legally challenged as arbitrary and
 
02:41:21.190 --> 02:41:21.200 align:start position:0%
capricious if they are not based on
 
02:41:24.870 --> 02:41:24.880 align:start position:0%
guidance from this policy-making body so
 
02:41:26.870 --> 02:41:26.880 align:start position:0%
mr representative gallagher's effort
 
02:41:29.670 --> 02:41:29.680 align:start position:0%
here is to place climate change which is
 
02:41:31.429 --> 02:41:31.439 align:start position:0%
one of the most significant issues of
 
02:41:33.190 --> 02:41:33.200 align:start position:0%
our time
 
02:41:36.950 --> 02:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
in the rsa so that it is a matter which
 
02:41:38.469 --> 02:41:38.479 align:start position:0%
must be
 
02:41:41.030 --> 02:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
or can be and and
 
02:41:42.550 --> 02:41:42.560 align:start position:0%
someone else can help you on that i
 
02:41:45.269 --> 02:41:45.279 align:start position:0%
believe i i believe it's a um
 
02:41:47.590 --> 02:41:47.600 align:start position:0%
a may and not a shell it's because it's
 
02:41:50.790 --> 02:41:50.800 align:start position:0%
ore or or or
 
02:41:53.670 --> 02:41:53.680 align:start position:0%
that climate change may be taken into
 
02:41:56.550 --> 02:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
account in rate setting this is an
 
02:41:59.110 --> 02:41:59.120 align:start position:0%
effort one to protect public health
 
02:42:01.830 --> 02:42:01.840 align:start position:0%
two to protect public safety and three
 
02:42:05.030 --> 02:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
to be proper stewards of ratepayer funds
 
02:42:07.110 --> 02:42:07.120 align:start position:0%
if the puc is not allowed to take into
 
02:42:07.120 --> 02:42:08.150 align:start position:0%
if the puc is not allowed to take into
account

02:42:08.150 --> 02:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
account
 
02:42:10.309 --> 02:42:10.319 align:start position:0%
the fact that a substation may be cited
 
02:42:12.710 --> 02:42:12.720 align:start position:0%
in such a place it's going to be flooded
 
02:42:15.670 --> 02:42:15.680 align:start position:0%
and be rendered unusable that's a waste
 
02:42:17.990 --> 02:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
of the ratepayers money and that money
 
02:42:21.269 --> 02:42:21.279 align:start position:0%
is recovered in default service charges
 
02:42:23.910 --> 02:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
similarly if the puc is unable to take
 
02:42:26.550 --> 02:42:26.560 align:start position:0%
into account the fact that expanding
 
02:42:29.750 --> 02:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
fossil fuel production may lead to an
 
02:42:32.710 --> 02:42:32.720 align:start position:0%
increase in our storm damage in our
 
02:42:35.269 --> 02:42:35.279 align:start position:0%
flooding in our sea levels
 
02:42:37.030 --> 02:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
then it's not going to be able to
 
02:42:38.870 --> 02:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
properly plan
 
02:42:40.630 --> 02:42:40.640 align:start position:0%
how to
 
02:42:44.230 --> 02:42:44.240 align:start position:0%
proceed with um our energy policy so
 
02:42:46.309 --> 02:42:46.319 align:start position:0%
that i think that's the explanation for
 
02:42:48.389 --> 02:42:48.399 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this bill
 
02:42:50.870 --> 02:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
and i've i've provided an information
 
02:42:52.870 --> 02:42:52.880 align:start position:0%
sheet that shows
 
02:42:55.429 --> 02:42:55.439 align:start position:0%
where it might perhaps be uh more
 
02:42:59.429 --> 02:42:59.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:01.349 --> 02:43:01.359 align:start position:0%
representative harrington is recognized
 
02:43:02.790 --> 02:43:02.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i want to
 
02:43:05.030 --> 02:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
reiterate this is not a policy issue
 
02:43:06.870 --> 02:43:06.880 align:start position:0%
where we can just say we're going to do
 
02:43:08.469 --> 02:43:08.479 align:start position:0%
it or not going to do it this is not
 
02:43:11.429 --> 02:43:11.439 align:start position:0%
possible to do you don't know who's
 
02:43:13.670 --> 02:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
going to be generating what day for
 
02:43:15.910 --> 02:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
example if there was a utility put out a
 
02:43:18.309 --> 02:43:18.319 align:start position:0%
contract with a supplier and like say
 
02:43:21.110 --> 02:43:21.120 align:start position:0%
next era and they um were buying power
 
02:43:23.030 --> 02:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
from seabrook that may get a lot of
 
02:43:25.110 --> 02:43:25.120 align:start position:0%
their power some days but then cbr could
 
02:43:26.950 --> 02:43:26.960 align:start position:0%
trip offline and they'd get zero power
 
02:43:28.710 --> 02:43:28.720 align:start position:0%
from there so the supplier would have to
 
02:43:30.550 --> 02:43:30.560 align:start position:0%
go get it someplace else maybe that
 
02:43:32.710 --> 02:43:32.720 align:start position:0%
someplace else is an oil plant maybe
 
02:43:35.269 --> 02:43:35.279 align:start position:0%
it's a gas plant uh whatever they have
 
02:43:36.950 --> 02:43:36.960 align:start position:0%
to get it that's part of the deal they
 
02:43:39.670 --> 02:43:39.680 align:start position:0%
don't sign up with a supplier saying
 
02:43:42.070 --> 02:43:42.080 align:start position:0%
we'll have so many megawatt hours of gas
 
02:43:44.309 --> 02:43:44.319 align:start position:0%
and so many megawatt hours of oil and so
 
02:43:46.950 --> 02:43:46.960 align:start position:0%
many megawatt hours of this they sign up
 
02:43:48.790 --> 02:43:48.800 align:start position:0%
for megawatt hours period and the
 
02:43:51.269 --> 02:43:51.279 align:start position:0%
supplier has to develop to deliver that
 
02:43:53.190 --> 02:43:53.200 align:start position:0%
and that's why we have the system set up
 
02:43:55.030 --> 02:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
with renewable portfolio standard
 
02:43:57.110 --> 02:43:57.120 align:start position:0%
there's no requirement that a utility
 
02:43:58.950 --> 02:43:58.960 align:start position:0%
buy renewable power they just have to
 
02:44:00.630 --> 02:44:00.640 align:start position:0%
buy the wrecks or make alternative
 
02:44:02.790 --> 02:44:02.800 align:start position:0%
compliance payments so no one can
 
02:44:05.190 --> 02:44:05.200 align:start position:0%
control from day to day what percentage
 
02:44:07.030 --> 02:44:07.040 align:start position:0%
of power is coming from what source it's
 
02:44:08.950 --> 02:44:08.960 align:start position:0%
just impossible to do the only way you
 
02:44:10.230 --> 02:44:10.240 align:start position:0%
could do that i guess if you went back
 
02:44:12.309 --> 02:44:12.319 align:start position:0%
to the way we used to have things years
 
02:44:14.230 --> 02:44:14.240 align:start position:0%
and years ago have the utilities buy all
 
02:44:15.910 --> 02:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
their own build all their own power
 
02:44:17.429 --> 02:44:17.439 align:start position:0%
plants and then you could say we're only
 
02:44:19.429 --> 02:44:19.439 align:start position:0%
going to allow them to build this type
 
02:44:21.030 --> 02:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
of plant and that's the only type of
 
02:44:22.870 --> 02:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
power we would get but short of that
 
02:44:27.429 --> 02:44:27.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:29.429 --> 02:44:29.439 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee
 
02:44:31.110 --> 02:44:31.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
02:44:31.120 --> 02:44:31.990 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
um

02:44:31.990 --> 02:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:44:34.550 --> 02:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
i think going back to the initial
 
02:44:36.230 --> 02:44:36.240 align:start position:0%
discussion that was started by
 
02:44:39.030 --> 02:44:39.040 align:start position:0%
representative bernardi on the economics
 
02:44:39.040 --> 02:44:39.990 align:start position:0%
representative bernardi on the economics
um

02:44:39.990 --> 02:44:40.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:41.110 align:start position:0%
um
i

02:44:41.110 --> 02:44:41.120 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:44:42.389 --> 02:44:42.399 align:start position:0%
did not speak with representative
 
02:44:43.990 --> 02:44:44.000 align:start position:0%
gallagher who was a prime sponsor of the
 
02:44:45.750 --> 02:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
bill about his
 
02:44:47.590 --> 02:44:47.600 align:start position:0%
intention for this bill
 
02:44:49.590 --> 02:44:49.600 align:start position:0%
but i do know that when i attended the
 
02:44:52.550 --> 02:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
10-year strategy meeting for the iso new
 
02:44:54.710 --> 02:44:54.720 align:start position:0%
england that the question that i asked
 
02:44:58.070 --> 02:44:58.080 align:start position:0%
them is if iso is reliability
 
02:45:02.070 --> 02:45:02.080 align:start position:0%
and and uh kneepole is rates if everyone
 
02:45:03.429 --> 02:45:03.439 align:start position:0%
is siloed
 
02:45:05.990 --> 02:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
and no one is taking into account
 
02:45:08.309 --> 02:45:08.319 align:start position:0%
the cost to our economy
 
02:45:11.349 --> 02:45:11.359 align:start position:0%
of bringing on more fossil fuel based
 
02:45:11.359 --> 02:45:12.630 align:start position:0%
of bringing on more fossil fuel based
um

02:45:12.630 --> 02:45:12.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:45:15.190 --> 02:45:15.200 align:start position:0%
facilities that end up costing everybody
 
02:45:15.200 --> 02:45:16.389 align:start position:0%
facilities that end up costing everybody
more

02:45:16.389 --> 02:45:16.399 align:start position:0%
more
 
02:45:18.950 --> 02:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
i believe 800 billion was the last
 
02:45:20.950 --> 02:45:20.960 align:start position:0%
estimate that we heard for climate
 
02:45:20.960 --> 02:45:22.550 align:start position:0%
estimate that we heard for climate
related

02:45:22.550 --> 02:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
related
 
02:45:24.870 --> 02:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
you know expenses to the united states
 
02:45:26.550 --> 02:45:26.560 align:start position:0%
it is not nothing
 
02:45:28.790 --> 02:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
it is an economic issue
 
02:45:29.830 --> 02:45:29.840 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:45:31.830 --> 02:45:31.840 align:start position:0%
uh the discussions around well there's
 
02:45:33.910 --> 02:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
no way to get a handle on it i believe
 
02:45:36.469 --> 02:45:36.479 align:start position:0%
that all we were trying to do was say
 
02:45:38.469 --> 02:45:38.479 align:start position:0%
some agency
 
02:45:39.990 --> 02:45:40.000 align:start position:0%
in our government
 
02:45:41.670 --> 02:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
does need to be taking this into
 
02:45:41.680 --> 02:45:43.429 align:start position:0%
does need to be taking this into
consideration

02:45:43.429 --> 02:45:43.439 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
02:45:45.670 --> 02:45:45.680 align:start position:0%
in terms of how we move forward with the
 
02:45:47.510 --> 02:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
projects that we approve because
 
02:45:50.070 --> 02:45:50.080 align:start position:0%
ultimately the cost of those projects
 
02:45:52.550 --> 02:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
will be increased if the cost of carbon
 
02:45:55.269 --> 02:45:55.279 align:start position:0%
ends up being you know placed on that
 
02:45:57.030 --> 02:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
particular type of fuel
 
02:45:58.870 --> 02:45:58.880 align:start position:0%
and we hear all the time that that's
 
02:46:01.030 --> 02:46:01.040 align:start position:0%
coming and that 46 other countries are
 
02:46:03.670 --> 02:46:03.680 align:start position:0%
already adopting carbon pricing so if we
 
02:46:05.910 --> 02:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
do nothing and we look
 
02:46:08.710 --> 02:46:08.720 align:start position:0%
uh we look just as as far as our nose
 
02:46:10.150 --> 02:46:10.160 align:start position:0%
and don't look any further down the road
 
02:46:11.750 --> 02:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
then i think we're doing a disservice to
 
02:46:14.070 --> 02:46:14.080 align:start position:0%
the rate payers because these costs are
 
02:46:14.080 --> 02:46:14.950 align:start position:0%
the rate payers because these costs are
real

02:46:14.950 --> 02:46:14.960 align:start position:0%
real
 
02:46:16.950 --> 02:46:16.960 align:start position:0%
and we can't avoid them by just saying
 
02:46:19.190 --> 02:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
we don't believe them
 
02:46:20.550 --> 02:46:20.560 align:start position:0%
so i guess that
 
02:46:22.870 --> 02:46:22.880 align:start position:0%
i think that the intent of the bill was
 
02:46:24.309 --> 02:46:24.319 align:start position:0%
to say that the public utilities
 
02:46:27.349 --> 02:46:27.359 align:start position:0%
commission who reviews facility projects
 
02:46:28.950 --> 02:46:28.960 align:start position:0%
that come through and what the utilities
 
02:46:30.389 --> 02:46:30.399 align:start position:0%
are doing in terms of how they're
 
02:46:30.399 --> 02:46:31.670 align:start position:0%
are doing in terms of how they're
securing

02:46:31.670 --> 02:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
securing
 
02:46:32.550 --> 02:46:32.560 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:46:34.790 --> 02:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
fuel for our system
 
02:46:36.389 --> 02:46:36.399 align:start position:0%
that that's the appropriate place to
 
02:46:38.550 --> 02:46:38.560 align:start position:0%
have the review done
 
02:46:40.070 --> 02:46:40.080 align:start position:0%
and i don't know who else would be able
 
02:46:43.590 --> 02:46:43.600 align:start position:0%
to do the review other than them so i
 
02:46:46.870 --> 02:46:46.880 align:start position:0%
i see it as a very reasonable request
 
02:46:48.389 --> 02:46:48.399 align:start position:0%
yes people would probably have to change
 
02:46:49.750 --> 02:46:49.760 align:start position:0%
the way they look at the stuff that
 
02:46:52.550 --> 02:46:52.560 align:start position:0%
comes across their desk but it's not
 
02:46:55.990 --> 02:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
it's not asking them to
 
02:46:57.990 --> 02:46:58.000 align:start position:0%
it's not asking them to
 
02:47:00.469 --> 02:47:00.479 align:start position:0%
adjust rate setting on the fly for the
 
02:47:01.510 --> 02:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
types of
 
02:47:03.110 --> 02:47:03.120 align:start position:0%
purchases that are happening on a
 
02:47:04.870 --> 02:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
day-to-day market i don't think that's
 
02:47:06.950 --> 02:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
the intent of the bill
 
02:47:08.630 --> 02:47:08.640 align:start position:0%
so that's that's like a red herring
 
02:47:10.630 --> 02:47:10.640 align:start position:0%
taking us in another direction it's just
 
02:47:12.309 --> 02:47:12.319 align:start position:0%
saying when you're looking at these
 
02:47:14.230 --> 02:47:14.240 align:start position:0%
facility projects that are coming across
 
02:47:15.510 --> 02:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
your desk you have to take it into
 
02:47:16.710 --> 02:47:16.720 align:start position:0%
account because there's a cost
 
02:47:18.710 --> 02:47:18.720 align:start position:0%
associated with it and there's a cost
 
02:47:21.190 --> 02:47:21.200 align:start position:0%
associated with it if we don't look at
 
02:47:21.200 --> 02:47:23.750 align:start position:0%
associated with it if we don't look at
that

02:47:23.750 --> 02:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:25.590 --> 02:47:25.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
 
02:47:27.990 --> 02:47:28.000 align:start position:0%
notter is recognized thank you mr
 
02:47:30.790 --> 02:47:30.800 align:start position:0%
chairman i just have in my notes that mr
 
02:47:30.800 --> 02:47:32.469 align:start position:0%
chairman i just have in my notes that mr
roberge

02:47:32.469 --> 02:47:32.479 align:start position:0%
roberge
 
02:47:34.469 --> 02:47:34.479 align:start position:0%
from the doe said that the bill doesn't
 
02:47:36.550 --> 02:47:36.560 align:start position:0%
include specifics and the doe would have
 
02:47:40.230 --> 02:47:40.240 align:start position:0%
to hire more people as consultants
 
02:47:41.670 --> 02:47:41.680 align:start position:0%
and who knows how much that's going to
 
02:47:41.680 --> 02:47:44.150 align:start position:0%
and who knows how much that's going to
cost

02:47:44.150 --> 02:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:45.750 --> 02:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative bernardi is
 
02:47:45.760 --> 02:47:47.510 align:start position:0%
thank you representative bernardi is
recognized

02:47:47.510 --> 02:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
02:47:49.590 --> 02:47:49.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
02:47:51.750 --> 02:47:51.760 align:start position:0%
i'm going to go back to the whole issue
 
02:47:54.349 --> 02:47:54.359 align:start position:0%
of trying to quantify
 
02:47:59.429 --> 02:47:59.439 align:start position:0%
environmental criteria as economic costs
 
02:48:01.510 --> 02:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
i understand the other side of the aisle
 
02:48:05.269 --> 02:48:05.279 align:start position:0%
believes this is a major economic issue
 
02:48:07.750 --> 02:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
this side of the aisle does not
 
02:48:10.710 --> 02:48:10.720 align:start position:0%
we are not in agreement with those
 
02:48:10.720 --> 02:48:12.070 align:start position:0%
we are not in agreement with those
criteria

02:48:12.070 --> 02:48:12.080 align:start position:0%
criteria
 
02:48:14.550 --> 02:48:14.560 align:start position:0%
and you're asking a
 
02:48:17.510 --> 02:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
public utilities commission then to come
 
02:48:19.910 --> 02:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
up with an agreement when there is
 
02:48:23.110 --> 02:48:23.120 align:start position:0%
disagreement within this country on how
 
02:48:26.469 --> 02:48:26.479 align:start position:0%
to assess these costs if they are indeed
 
02:48:27.830 --> 02:48:27.840 align:start position:0%
even costs
 
02:48:30.469 --> 02:48:30.479 align:start position:0%
and this is inexpedient to legislate on
 
02:48:33.269 --> 02:48:33.279 align:start position:0%
that basis alone
 
02:48:36.389 --> 02:48:36.399 align:start position:0%
okay further discussion representative
 
02:48:36.399 --> 02:48:38.230 align:start position:0%
okay further discussion representative
oxenom

02:48:38.230 --> 02:48:38.240 align:start position:0%
oxenom
 
02:48:39.990 --> 02:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:41.190 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
uh

02:48:41.190 --> 02:48:41.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:48:42.790 --> 02:48:42.800 align:start position:0%
i believe that representative
 
02:48:44.790 --> 02:48:44.800 align:start position:0%
harrington's remarks missed the point
 
02:48:46.870 --> 02:48:46.880 align:start position:0%
it's not about the day-to-day purchase
 
02:48:48.469 --> 02:48:48.479 align:start position:0%
of fuels
 
02:48:50.389 --> 02:48:50.399 align:start position:0%
what we're asking for here is that the
 
02:48:52.389 --> 02:48:52.399 align:start position:0%
puc be in
 
02:48:56.309 --> 02:48:56.319 align:start position:0%
enabled in its decision making to reckon
 
02:49:00.389 --> 02:49:00.399 align:start position:0%
with the costs actual costs that have
 
02:49:00.399 --> 02:49:01.750 align:start position:0%
with the costs actual costs that have
occurred

02:49:01.750 --> 02:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
occurred
 
02:49:03.990 --> 02:49:04.000 align:start position:0%
when a rate setting
 
02:49:06.469 --> 02:49:06.479 align:start position:0%
action is undertaken so that what the
 
02:49:08.469 --> 02:49:08.479 align:start position:0%
utilities can come in
 
02:49:11.990 --> 02:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
with a cost ask is this a just or
 
02:49:15.349 --> 02:49:15.359 align:start position:0%
reasonable cost which the puc if it says
 
02:49:17.510 --> 02:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
yes it's just unreasonable then goes
 
02:49:19.990 --> 02:49:20.000 align:start position:0%
into the default service charge that's
 
02:49:23.110 --> 02:49:23.120 align:start position:0%
that's the action here
 
02:49:24.070 --> 02:49:24.080 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
02:49:29.990 --> 02:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:31.830 --> 02:49:31.840 align:start position:0%
representative harrington
 
02:49:33.590 --> 02:49:33.600 align:start position:0%
with all due respect i think people some
 
02:49:34.389 --> 02:49:34.399 align:start position:0%
people in this committee don't
 
02:49:36.550 --> 02:49:36.560 align:start position:0%
understand how rates are set this is
 
02:49:38.389 --> 02:49:38.399 align:start position:0%
you're trying to go out and look and say
 
02:49:41.030 --> 02:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
okay we're going to put a certain charge
 
02:49:42.710 --> 02:49:42.720 align:start position:0%
on every megawatt that's produced from
 
02:49:45.429 --> 02:49:45.439 align:start position:0%
natural gas a different charge on ones
 
02:49:46.790 --> 02:49:46.800 align:start position:0%
that are produced from oil a different
 
02:49:48.150 --> 02:49:48.160 align:start position:0%
one from coal
 
02:49:51.269 --> 02:49:51.279 align:start position:0%
um maybe none on one from wind who knows
 
02:49:52.550 --> 02:49:52.560 align:start position:0%
what you can come up with anything you
 
02:49:55.030 --> 02:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
want and sign it but those are not in
 
02:49:57.429 --> 02:49:57.439 align:start position:0%
the contracts the the supplier of the
 
02:49:59.670 --> 02:49:59.680 align:start position:0%
power comes to the
 
02:50:01.750 --> 02:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
the utility and says okay here's your
 
02:50:03.830 --> 02:50:03.840 align:start position:0%
load demand here's our attempt at
 
02:50:05.910 --> 02:50:05.920 align:start position:0%
meeting that load demand and they put a
 
02:50:08.469 --> 02:50:08.479 align:start position:0%
proposal out and they may list 20 or 30
 
02:50:09.910 --> 02:50:09.920 align:start position:0%
different contracts that they have they
 
02:50:12.309 --> 02:50:12.319 align:start position:0%
may have contracts with someone who has
 
02:50:13.910 --> 02:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
contracts with someone who generates
 
02:50:15.830 --> 02:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
electricity and they might not even know
 
02:50:17.349 --> 02:50:17.359 align:start position:0%
where the source of the electricity is
 
02:50:19.190 --> 02:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
coming from but they have an obligation
 
02:50:21.429 --> 02:50:21.439 align:start position:0%
to meet that contractual obligation by
 
02:50:23.510 --> 02:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
supplying an electricity i know of no
 
02:50:25.670 --> 02:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
contract that says so much percentage is
 
02:50:27.670 --> 02:50:27.680 align:start position:0%
coming from solar or so much percentage
 
02:50:29.670 --> 02:50:29.680 align:start position:0%
is coming from wind and if you don't
 
02:50:31.269 --> 02:50:31.279 align:start position:0%
know that there's no way you can assign
 
02:50:32.790 --> 02:50:32.800 align:start position:0%
a cost to it that's why we have the
 
02:50:34.790 --> 02:50:34.800 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standing because we
 
02:50:36.790 --> 02:50:36.800 align:start position:0%
give preferential treatment to renewable
 
02:50:38.950 --> 02:50:38.960 align:start position:0%
energy by saying okay
 
02:50:40.710 --> 02:50:40.720 align:start position:0%
if you every megawatt you produce you
 
02:50:42.950 --> 02:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
get this piece of paper that says it's
 
02:50:44.870 --> 02:50:44.880 align:start position:0%
uh you get one megawatt of worth of
 
02:50:46.469 --> 02:50:46.479 align:start position:0%
wreck and now you can turn around and
 
02:50:48.870 --> 02:50:48.880 align:start position:0%
the utilities must buy that they have no
 
02:50:50.550 --> 02:50:50.560 align:start position:0%
choice so they go up and buy that and
 
02:50:52.469 --> 02:50:52.479 align:start position:0%
that's how the renewables are rewarded
 
02:50:54.150 --> 02:50:54.160 align:start position:0%
you can say we do the same thing with
 
02:50:57.110 --> 02:50:57.120 align:start position:0%
generation on reggie where we penalize
 
02:50:58.870 --> 02:50:58.880 align:start position:0%
the people that produce net and emit
 
02:51:01.269 --> 02:51:01.279 align:start position:0%
natural gas and make them pay more for
 
02:51:03.269 --> 02:51:03.279 align:start position:0%
it all those costs get built into the
 
02:51:06.070 --> 02:51:06.080 align:start position:0%
rates but nobody on any given day can
 
02:51:08.230 --> 02:51:08.240 align:start position:0%
come out and say what percentage is
 
02:51:09.670 --> 02:51:09.680 align:start position:0%
going to be produced by what type of
 
02:51:12.070 --> 02:51:12.080 align:start position:0%
generation it varies all over the place
 
02:51:13.990 --> 02:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
you could have a
 
02:51:16.630 --> 02:51:16.640 align:start position:0%
a similar fault at both seabrook and
 
02:51:18.230 --> 02:51:18.240 align:start position:0%
millstone because they're very similar
 
02:51:20.150 --> 02:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
nuclear plants the same generation
 
02:51:21.670 --> 02:51:21.680 align:start position:0%
westinghouse for loop pressurized
 
02:51:23.510 --> 02:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
reactors they could shut both plants
 
02:51:26.389 --> 02:51:26.399 align:start position:0%
down and you'd lose 2400 megawatts
 
02:51:28.469 --> 02:51:28.479 align:start position:0%
instantly the water the power is going
 
02:51:29.910 --> 02:51:29.920 align:start position:0%
to come from someplace else but no one's
 
02:51:31.510 --> 02:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
going to know where that is there's no
 
02:51:33.750 --> 02:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
way you're telling so this this concept
 
02:51:35.190 --> 02:51:35.200 align:start position:0%
that somehow we can put a price on
 
02:51:36.550 --> 02:51:36.560 align:start position:0%
something when we don't even know where
 
02:51:37.830 --> 02:51:37.840 align:start position:0%
it's coming from
 
02:51:39.750 --> 02:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
is erroneous and again it's we already
 
02:51:41.510 --> 02:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
cover that in the renewable portfolio
 
02:51:43.190 --> 02:51:43.200 align:start position:0%
standard where we give preferential
 
02:51:45.910 --> 02:51:45.920 align:start position:0%
treatment uh for renewables and we cover
 
02:51:48.070 --> 02:51:48.080 align:start position:0%
it in reggie where we penalize uh
 
02:51:52.469 --> 02:51:52.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:54.630 --> 02:51:54.640 align:start position:0%
representative oxidant thank you very
 
02:51:57.590 --> 02:51:57.600 align:start position:0%
much i'm i i do believe that we are
 
02:52:00.150 --> 02:52:00.160 align:start position:0%
speaking past each other representative
 
02:52:00.160 --> 02:52:01.269 align:start position:0%
speaking past each other representative

02:52:23.670 --> 02:52:23.680 align:start position:0%
these are the kinds of issues we're
 
02:52:25.910 --> 02:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
talking about not the issues that you
 
02:52:27.590 --> 02:52:27.600 align:start position:0%
have been addressing
 
02:52:29.030 --> 02:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
an assessment of distribution
 
02:52:31.510 --> 02:52:31.520 align:start position:0%

other environmental laws that may impact
 
02:52:41.030 --> 02:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
utilities assets or customers so we have
 
02:52:42.630 --> 02:52:42.640 align:start position:0%
in statute
 
02:52:45.590 --> 02:52:45.600 align:start position:0%
a requirement for an assessment of
 
02:52:45.600 --> 02:52:46.790 align:start position:0%
a requirement for an assessment of
impact

02:52:46.790 --> 02:52:46.800 align:start position:0%
impact
 
02:52:49.510 --> 02:52:49.520 align:start position:0%
of environmental laws that may impact a
 
02:52:52.230 --> 02:52:52.240 align:start position:0%
utilities assets or customers
 
02:52:54.550 --> 02:52:54.560 align:start position:0%
environmental laws are different
 
02:52:56.710 --> 02:52:56.720 align:start position:0%
from the impact of climate change we
 
02:52:59.990 --> 02:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
don't have that in law so we have no way
 
02:53:02.550 --> 02:53:02.560 align:start position:0%
to put that into the consideration thank
 
02:53:02.560 --> 02:53:04.150 align:start position:0%
to put that into the consideration thank
you

02:53:04.150 --> 02:53:04.160 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:53:06.630 --> 02:53:06.640 align:start position:0%
representative oxendine we're straight
 
02:53:08.550 --> 02:53:08.560 align:start position:0%
off the topic of the bill here you're
 
02:53:12.070 --> 02:53:12.080 align:start position:0%
talking about other sections of law
 
02:53:14.469 --> 02:53:14.479 align:start position:0%
and there's no amendment before us
 
02:53:17.190 --> 02:53:17.200 align:start position:0%
so we're we're off topic we need to talk
 
02:53:17.200 --> 02:53:18.070 align:start position:0%
so we're we're off topic we need to talk
about

02:53:18.070 --> 02:53:18.080 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:53:20.309 --> 02:53:20.319 align:start position:0%
the law that's before us or the bill
 
02:53:21.910 --> 02:53:21.920 align:start position:0%
that's before us
 
02:53:24.150 --> 02:53:24.160 align:start position:0%
and so i'd appreciate it if you could
 
02:53:26.950 --> 02:53:26.960 align:start position:0%
confine your remarks to the legislation
 
02:53:28.469 --> 02:53:28.479 align:start position:0%
that's before us
 
02:53:30.790 --> 02:53:30.800 align:start position:0%
and i think i've already heard you say
 
02:53:30.800 --> 02:53:32.150 align:start position:0%
and i think i've already heard you say
that

02:53:32.150 --> 02:53:32.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:53:34.870 --> 02:53:34.880 align:start position:0%
as written it doesn't do
 
02:53:37.750 --> 02:53:37.760 align:start position:0%
what you envision it to do and therefore
 
02:53:40.950 --> 02:53:40.960 align:start position:0%
i would expect that you would vote to
 
02:53:44.309 --> 02:53:44.319 align:start position:0%
support the motion of itl
 
02:53:46.150 --> 02:53:46.160 align:start position:0%
am i right or not
 
02:53:48.070 --> 02:53:48.080 align:start position:0%
go ahead well well close
 
02:53:50.230 --> 02:53:50.240 align:start position:0%
as i said at the outset i think ols made
 
02:53:53.750 --> 02:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
a mistake in putting this in 378 30 um
 
02:53:57.670 --> 02:53:57.680 align:start position:0%
seven rather than in 37 or 38 where i
 
02:53:59.110 --> 02:53:59.120 align:start position:0%
think it would have been better place so
 
02:54:01.670 --> 02:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
i would recommend interim study so that
 
02:54:04.150 --> 02:54:04.160 align:start position:0%
a better bill could be introduced ah
 
02:54:06.710 --> 02:54:06.720 align:start position:0%
okay you didn't say that earlier but i
 
02:54:08.550 --> 02:54:08.560 align:start position:0%
didn't get to my conclusion i was saving
 
02:54:10.150 --> 02:54:10.160 align:start position:0%
that for the you know
 
02:54:10.160 --> 02:54:11.830 align:start position:0%
that for the you know
okay

02:54:11.830 --> 02:54:11.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:54:13.590 --> 02:54:13.600 align:start position:0%
the big finish
 
02:54:15.510 --> 02:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
the dramatic big fish that's what i see
 
02:54:19.269 --> 02:54:19.279 align:start position:0%
okay any further discussion on this bill
 
02:54:21.030 --> 02:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
seeing none i asked the clerk to call
 
02:54:23.590 --> 02:54:23.600 align:start position:0%

02:54:27.190 --> 02:54:27.200 align:start position:0%

okay by a vote a surprising vote of 12

02:55:40.950 --> 02:55:40.960 align:start position:0%
surprising only because i thought it
 
02:55:43.190 --> 02:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
would be 21 to nothing because this bill
 
02:55:44.349 --> 02:55:44.359 align:start position:0%
is totally
 
02:55:46.469 --> 02:55:46.479 align:start position:0%
unimplementable as written
 
02:55:47.590 --> 02:55:47.600 align:start position:0%
but anyway
 
02:55:50.469 --> 02:55:50.479 align:start position:0%
by a surprising vote of 12 to 10 the itl

02:56:44.950 --> 02:56:44.960 align:start position:0%
which i am introducing
 
02:56:47.269 --> 02:56:47.279 align:start position:0%
and this amendment
 
02:56:49.990 --> 02:56:50.000 align:start position:0%
addresses some of the
 
02:56:52.070 --> 02:56:52.080 align:start position:0%
department of energy concerns they had
 
02:56:54.790 --> 02:56:54.800 align:start position:0%
with the original bill and name changes
 
02:56:58.790 --> 02:56:58.800 align:start position:0%
primarily and corrects a administrative
 
02:56:58.800 --> 02:57:00.150 align:start position:0%
primarily and corrects a administrative
oversight

02:57:00.150 --> 02:57:00.160 align:start position:0%
oversight
 
02:57:01.590 --> 02:57:01.600 align:start position:0%
more importantly
 
02:57:03.750 --> 02:57:03.760 align:start position:0%
uh if you turn to
 
02:57:05.990 --> 02:57:06.000 align:start position:0%
if you turn it to a chapter five or
 
02:57:08.150 --> 02:57:08.160 align:start position:0%
section five i should say of the
 
02:57:08.160 --> 02:57:09.110 align:start position:0%
section five i should say of the
amendment

02:57:09.110 --> 02:57:09.120 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:57:11.269 --> 02:57:11.279 align:start position:0%
uh i've
 
02:57:12.870 --> 02:57:12.880 align:start position:0%
changed the repeal
 
02:57:15.190 --> 02:57:15.200 align:start position:0%
to repeal the committee but also the
 
02:57:16.870 --> 02:57:16.880 align:start position:0%
duties that were that were overlooked
 
02:57:19.590 --> 02:57:19.600 align:start position:0%
before to repeal the uh duties that go
 
02:57:21.030 --> 02:57:21.040 align:start position:0%
along with that committee
 
02:57:23.750 --> 02:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
i also in more importantly i've
 
02:57:26.389 --> 02:57:26.399 align:start position:0%
preserved paragraph four f which was
 
02:57:28.630 --> 02:57:28.640 align:start position:0%
inadvertently listed in the in the
 
02:57:31.349 --> 02:57:31.359 align:start position:0%
original bill as a repeal i preserved it
 
02:57:34.309 --> 02:57:34.319 align:start position:0%
so that we are ensured that the report
 
02:57:37.590 --> 02:57:37.600 align:start position:0%
on the sbc gets not only done but
 
02:57:39.510 --> 02:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
submitted to the department of education
 
02:57:40.710 --> 02:57:40.720 align:start position:0%
as well
 
02:57:42.950 --> 02:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
so the rest of the
 
02:57:46.550 --> 02:57:46.560 align:start position:0%
yes there there there was there was a
 
02:57:51.110 --> 02:57:51.120 align:start position:0%
one sentence in in the rsa that requires
 
02:57:52.870 --> 02:57:52.880 align:start position:0%
the department of education to get a
 
02:57:56.230 --> 02:57:56.240 align:start position:0%
copy of the citizens benefits charge
 
02:57:59.030 --> 02:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
and by repealing
 
02:58:02.550 --> 02:58:02.560 align:start position:0%
4f in my original bill it inadvertently
 
02:58:03.990 --> 02:58:04.000 align:start position:0%
deleted that requirement for the
 
02:58:06.710 --> 02:58:06.720 align:start position:0%
department of education to get that so i
 
02:58:08.230 --> 02:58:08.240 align:start position:0%
i i uh
 
02:58:10.389 --> 02:58:10.399 align:start position:0%
uh i corrected that
 
02:58:13.990 --> 02:58:14.000 align:start position:0%
um what you see here are just other uh
 
02:58:15.990 --> 02:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
corrections to change the name of the of
 
02:58:18.150 --> 02:58:18.160 align:start position:0%
the commission and and the department
 
02:58:19.670 --> 02:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
into what the department of energy wants
 
02:58:20.710 --> 02:58:20.720 align:start position:0%
to see
 
02:58:22.550 --> 02:58:22.560 align:start position:0%
so the crux of the bill eliminates the
 
02:58:24.150 --> 02:58:24.160 align:start position:0%
oversight committee eliminates the
 
02:58:26.630 --> 02:58:26.640 align:start position:0%
duties um related to the oversight
 
02:58:28.309 --> 02:58:28.319 align:start position:0%
committee but
 
02:58:31.429 --> 02:58:31.439 align:start position:0%
and make sure that any reports that were
 
02:58:31.439 --> 02:58:32.630 align:start position:0%
and make sure that any reports that were
originally

02:58:32.630 --> 02:58:32.640 align:start position:0%
originally
 
02:58:34.389 --> 02:58:34.399 align:start position:0%
sent to the legislative oversight
 
02:58:36.150 --> 02:58:36.160 align:start position:0%
committee in addition to other
 
02:58:38.790 --> 02:58:38.800 align:start position:0%
committees that those reports still get
 
02:58:40.790 --> 02:58:40.800 align:start position:0%
sent to the house science and tech
 
02:58:43.429 --> 02:58:43.439 align:start position:0%
committee and also to the senate energy
 
02:58:46.309 --> 02:58:46.319 align:start position:0%
committee as well
 
02:58:46.319 --> 02:58:47.670 align:start position:0%
committee as well
so

02:58:47.670 --> 02:58:47.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:58:49.910 --> 02:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
that's that's my discussion on the
 
02:58:51.910 --> 02:58:51.920 align:start position:0%
all right uh two two things i would
 
02:58:53.750 --> 02:58:53.760 align:start position:0%

03:01:47.269 --> 03:01:47.279 align:start position:0%
the original intent of this committee
 
03:01:48.630 --> 03:01:48.640 align:start position:0%
was to
 
03:01:51.429 --> 03:01:51.439 align:start position:0%
oversight of the divestiture
 
03:01:53.190 --> 03:01:53.200 align:start position:0%

generation
 
03:01:57.830 --> 03:01:57.840 align:start position:0%
that purpose was uh obtained uh a few
 
03:01:58.950 --> 03:01:58.960 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
03:02:01.990 --> 03:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
and although there wasn't al although
 
03:02:05.269 --> 03:02:05.279 align:start position:0%
there was a change made to the original
 
03:02:07.269 --> 03:02:07.279 align:start position:0%
purpose of this committee
 
03:02:07.279 --> 03:02:09.510 align:start position:0%
purpose of this committee
um

03:02:09.510 --> 03:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:02:12.150 --> 03:02:12.160 align:start position:0%
we real we haven't had any additional
 
03:02:13.830 --> 03:02:13.840 align:start position:0%
meetings since then
 
03:02:16.309 --> 03:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
and as i looked over various committees
 
03:02:18.469 --> 03:02:18.479 align:start position:0%
that we may want to eliminate because
 
03:02:22.070 --> 03:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
they've gone well past their smell test
 
03:02:24.070 --> 03:02:24.080 align:start position:0%
i said we really don't need
 
03:02:25.030 --> 03:02:25.040 align:start position:0%
to be
 
03:02:27.349 --> 03:02:27.359 align:start position:0%
trying to put a square peg into a round
 
03:02:30.150 --> 03:02:30.160 align:start position:0%
hole on a committee if we have a special
 
03:02:32.150 --> 03:02:32.160 align:start position:0%
need for a commission
 
03:02:32.160 --> 03:02:32.870 align:start position:0%
need for a commission
to

03:02:32.870 --> 03:02:32.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:02:35.190 --> 03:02:35.200 align:start position:0%
look at specific topics we can certainly
 
03:02:37.510 --> 03:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
come forward with a bill at some future
 
03:02:40.710 --> 03:02:40.720 align:start position:0%
date this particular bill i felt the
 
03:02:43.429 --> 03:02:43.439 align:start position:0%
time was that we just get get rid of it
 
03:02:43.439 --> 03:02:44.469 align:start position:0%
time was that we just get get rid of it
because

03:02:44.469 --> 03:02:44.479 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:02:46.469 --> 03:02:46.479 align:start position:0%
we really have no
 
03:02:48.469 --> 03:02:48.479 align:start position:0%
no real need to be discussing
 
03:02:51.990 --> 03:02:52.000 align:start position:0%
divestiture or any related items to that
 
03:02:54.230 --> 03:02:54.240 align:start position:0%
right now
 
03:02:56.150 --> 03:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
the commissions that have been adopted
 
03:02:57.910 --> 03:02:57.920 align:start position:0%
in the past that do have value or things
 
03:03:00.070 --> 03:03:00.080 align:start position:0%
such as the offshore wind commission
 
03:03:03.030 --> 03:03:03.040 align:start position:0%
which has value i don't see value in
 
03:03:06.150 --> 03:03:06.160 align:start position:0%
this commission to extend it as it is
 
03:03:08.230 --> 03:03:08.240 align:start position:0%
and i don't want to keep
 
03:03:10.870 --> 03:03:10.880 align:start position:0%
adding to or subtracting from it to make
 
03:03:13.110 --> 03:03:13.120 align:start position:0%
something work when its life has been
 
03:03:15.590 --> 03:03:15.600 align:start position:0%
extended has been extinguished so i
 
03:03:16.950 --> 03:03:16.960 align:start position:0%
think it's better that we just delete
 
03:03:16.960 --> 03:03:17.670 align:start position:0%
think it's better that we just delete
this

03:03:17.670 --> 03:03:17.680 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:03:19.670 --> 03:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
one here and next year if someone thinks
 
03:03:21.190 --> 03:03:21.200 align:start position:0%
we need to have a commission to discuss
 
03:03:23.110 --> 03:03:23.120 align:start position:0%
a specific area
 
03:03:25.670 --> 03:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
by all means let's bring it forward and
 
03:03:28.389 --> 03:03:28.399 align:start position:0%
we can discuss it
 
03:03:31.269 --> 03:03:31.279 align:start position:0%
okay the question before us is on the
 
03:03:33.670 --> 03:03:33.680 align:start position:0%
motion to adopt
 
03:03:33.680 --> 03:03:35.870 align:start position:0%
motion to adopt
amendment

03:03:35.870 --> 03:03:35.880 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
03:03:37.830 --> 03:03:37.840 align:start position:0%
0869 h
 
03:03:38.870 --> 03:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
so let's
 
03:03:41.670 --> 03:03:41.680 align:start position:0%
let's confine our discussion right now
 
03:03:43.510 --> 03:03:43.520 align:start position:0%
to the amendment
 
03:03:45.990 --> 03:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
once we adopt or reject the amendment
 
03:03:47.910 --> 03:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
then we can have a discussion about the
 
03:03:49.830 --> 03:03:49.840 align:start position:0%
original bill
 
03:03:52.790 --> 03:03:52.800 align:start position:0%
so does anyone have a comment about the
 
03:03:54.630 --> 03:03:54.640 align:start position:0%
amendment itself
 
03:03:56.950 --> 03:03:56.960 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts
 
03:03:56.960 --> 03:03:57.750 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts
uh

03:03:57.750 --> 03:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:03:59.269 --> 03:03:59.279 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:04:01.110 --> 03:04:01.120 align:start position:0%
mr chair i'm a little bit confused
 
03:04:02.790 --> 03:04:02.800 align:start position:0%
because when we were just doing a
 
03:04:04.790 --> 03:04:04.800 align:start position:0%
discussion we went off just the
 
03:04:04.800 --> 03:04:06.309 align:start position:0%
discussion we went off just the
amendment

03:04:06.309 --> 03:04:06.319 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
03:04:08.469 --> 03:04:08.479 align:start position:0%
we went on to the background
 
03:04:10.950 --> 03:04:10.960 align:start position:0%
and i don't know
 
03:04:14.150 --> 03:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
who on this committee has sat
 
03:04:16.870 --> 03:04:16.880 align:start position:0%
on the electric oversight committee i
 
03:04:16.880 --> 03:04:18.070 align:start position:0%
on the electric oversight committee i
have

03:04:18.070 --> 03:04:18.080 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:04:19.990 --> 03:04:20.000 align:start position:0%
for many years
 
03:04:20.000 --> 03:04:20.830 align:start position:0%
for many years
and

03:04:20.830 --> 03:04:20.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:04:24.070 --> 03:04:24.080 align:start position:0%
i want to speak to that so when we adopt
 
03:04:27.349 --> 03:04:27.359 align:start position:0%
the amendment that's the time to do that
 
03:04:29.349 --> 03:04:29.359 align:start position:0%
that is correct all right thank you and
 
03:04:32.070 --> 03:04:32.080 align:start position:0%
i apologize for allowing representative
 
03:04:34.469 --> 03:04:34.479 align:start position:0%
pimentel's question i should have
 
03:04:36.710 --> 03:04:36.720 align:start position:0%
i should not have accepted that question
 
03:04:38.389 --> 03:04:38.399 align:start position:0%
because it wasn't about the amendment
 
03:04:40.070 --> 03:04:40.080 align:start position:0%
and i apologize to the full committee
 
03:04:42.150 --> 03:04:42.160 align:start position:0%
for that representative mcgee do you
 
03:04:44.389 --> 03:04:44.399 align:start position:0%
have a question about the amendment i do
 
03:04:46.710 --> 03:04:46.720 align:start position:0%
good thank you um the question is about
 
03:04:49.269 --> 03:04:49.279 align:start position:0%
the testimony that um representative
 
03:04:51.190 --> 03:04:51.200 align:start position:0%
thomas made already when i questioned
 
03:04:52.550 --> 03:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
him on the department of energy
 
03:04:52.560 --> 03:04:53.590 align:start position:0%
him on the department of energy
reference

03:04:53.590 --> 03:04:53.600 align:start position:0%
reference
 
03:04:54.550 --> 03:04:54.560 align:start position:0%
and i
 
03:04:56.150 --> 03:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
i don't know how that relates to this
 
03:04:57.590 --> 03:04:57.600 align:start position:0%
amendment but i don't see anything in
 
03:05:00.070 --> 03:05:00.080 align:start position:0%
here about the department of energy so
 
03:05:02.230 --> 03:05:02.240 align:start position:0%
i'm just wondering which portion of this
 
03:05:04.150 --> 03:05:04.160 align:start position:0%
amendment relates to that the
 
03:05:06.630 --> 03:05:06.640 align:start position:0%
preservation of that that you said
 
03:05:08.870 --> 03:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
would be here
 
03:05:10.630 --> 03:05:10.640 align:start position:0%
you could just refer me to the line or
 
03:05:15.990 --> 03:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:18.870 --> 03:05:18.880 align:start position:0%
going to item
 
03:05:20.630 --> 03:05:20.640 align:start position:0%
roman numeral 6
 
03:05:22.070 --> 03:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
3 6
 
03:05:23.670 --> 03:05:23.680 align:start position:0%
there was a reference made to the
 
03:05:26.150 --> 03:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
department and the commission
 
03:05:28.710 --> 03:05:28.720 align:start position:0%
and that was changed to environmental
 
03:05:32.870 --> 03:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
services and the department of energy
 
03:05:35.190 --> 03:05:35.200 align:start position:0%
oh okay you said education that's why no
 
03:05:37.590 --> 03:05:37.600 align:start position:0%
i said i did say education but your your
 
03:05:39.030 --> 03:05:39.040 align:start position:0%
direct question was for department of
 
03:05:41.269 --> 03:05:41.279 align:start position:0%
energy so i was answering that one
 
03:05:43.110 --> 03:05:43.120 align:start position:0%
if you want to if your question is
 
03:05:45.349 --> 03:05:45.359 align:start position:0%
related to the department of energy
 
03:05:47.830 --> 03:05:47.840 align:start position:0%
it it does not show in this amendment
 
03:05:50.230 --> 03:05:50.240 align:start position:0%
because i did not
 
03:05:51.990 --> 03:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
i did not repeal
 
03:05:52.000 --> 03:05:53.030 align:start position:0%
i did not repeal
for

03:05:53.030 --> 03:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:05:54.870 --> 03:05:54.880 align:start position:0%
subparagraph f
 
03:05:57.670 --> 03:05:57.680 align:start position:0%
buried in four subparagraph f in another
 
03:05:57.680 --> 03:05:58.710 align:start position:0%
buried in four subparagraph f in another
line

03:05:58.710 --> 03:05:58.720 align:start position:0%
line
 
03:06:01.349 --> 03:06:01.359 align:start position:0%
it talk to department of education but
 
03:06:03.110 --> 03:06:03.120 align:start position:0%
not in this amendment because it's not
 
03:06:05.030 --> 03:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
being repealed so you eliminated the
 
03:06:07.510 --> 03:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
repeal i eliminated the repeal which
 
03:06:11.590 --> 03:06:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:13.990 --> 03:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
and remember representative mcgee to ask
 
03:06:15.190 --> 03:06:15.200 align:start position:0%
for permission to ask follow-up
 
03:06:17.110 --> 03:06:17.120 align:start position:0%
questions as i was just going to say
 
03:06:18.790 --> 03:06:18.800 align:start position:0%
follow-up okay follow-up
 
03:06:21.670 --> 03:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
and the last thing i'll ask is um
 
03:06:23.349 --> 03:06:23.359 align:start position:0%
on line 11
 
03:06:25.429 --> 03:06:25.439 align:start position:0%
which is section 6
 
03:06:25.439 --> 03:06:26.389 align:start position:0%
which is section 6
section

03:06:26.389 --> 03:06:26.399 align:start position:0%
section
 
03:06:29.750 --> 03:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh f under paragraph six um
 
03:06:32.950 --> 03:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
it says that beginning in 2000
 
03:06:34.710 --> 03:06:34.720 align:start position:0%
the department of environmental services
 
03:06:36.790 --> 03:06:36.800 align:start position:0%
and the department of energy
 
03:06:38.630 --> 03:06:38.640 align:start position:0%
um if we didn't have the department of
 
03:06:40.389 --> 03:06:40.399 align:start position:0%
energy then is that
 
03:06:42.950 --> 03:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
relevant should it say like and or or
 
03:06:44.790 --> 03:06:44.800 align:start position:0%
should should it be said some other way
 
03:06:47.030 --> 03:06:47.040 align:start position:0%
because it makes it sound as though
 
03:06:49.670 --> 03:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
uh this has been ongoing since 2000 when
 
03:06:51.190 --> 03:06:51.200 align:start position:0%
the department of energy wasn't in
 
03:06:54.550 --> 03:06:54.560 align:start position:0%
effect in the last five or six years
 
03:06:56.950 --> 03:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
well i i i would agree with your
 
03:06:59.429 --> 03:06:59.439 align:start position:0%
confusion however i am responding to
 
03:07:01.750 --> 03:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
requests from the department of energy
 
03:07:03.349 --> 03:07:03.359 align:start position:0%
where they have told me that they are
 
03:07:06.630 --> 03:07:06.640 align:start position:0%
trying to do a systematic review of all
 
03:07:10.469 --> 03:07:10.479 align:start position:0%
rsas to more closely
 
03:07:12.389 --> 03:07:12.399 align:start position:0%
relate to their new department
 
03:07:14.469 --> 03:07:14.479 align:start position:0%
so that's that's the purpose of that
 
03:07:17.269 --> 03:07:17.279 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
03:07:22.230 --> 03:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
okay further discussion on the amendment
 
03:07:23.590 --> 03:07:23.600 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
03:07:25.030 --> 03:07:25.040 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts has a
 
03:07:27.110 --> 03:07:27.120 align:start position:0%
question i just i'm going to question
 
03:07:29.349 --> 03:07:29.359 align:start position:0%
that because that's retroactive
 
03:07:31.030 --> 03:07:31.040 align:start position:0%
legislation and i didn't think we could
 
03:07:32.950 --> 03:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
make retroactive
 
03:07:32.960 --> 03:07:34.550 align:start position:0%
make retroactive
legislation

03:07:34.550 --> 03:07:34.560 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
03:07:39.110 --> 03:07:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:41.510 --> 03:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
that's a good point i think that this
 
03:07:43.590 --> 03:07:43.600 align:start position:0%
issue could be addressed
 
03:07:45.349 --> 03:07:45.359 align:start position:0%
in the senate
 
03:07:47.269 --> 03:07:47.279 align:start position:0%
that's probably just a
 
03:07:49.670 --> 03:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
fairly simple and quick
 
03:07:52.469 --> 03:07:52.479 align:start position:0%
editorial change that needs to be made
 
03:07:54.230 --> 03:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
representative flett
 
03:07:56.389 --> 03:07:56.399 align:start position:0%
yes the suggestion to the senate is
 
03:08:01.269 --> 03:08:01.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:01.279 --> 03:08:02.950 align:start position:0%
 
correct

03:08:02.950 --> 03:08:02.960 align:start position:0%
correct
 
03:08:06.389 --> 03:08:06.399 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts i i guess
 
03:08:08.230 --> 03:08:08.240 align:start position:0%
you know i probably had too much for
 
03:08:09.750 --> 03:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
lunch but
 
03:08:09.760 --> 03:08:11.030 align:start position:0%
lunch but
uh

03:08:11.030 --> 03:08:11.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:08:13.590 --> 03:08:13.600 align:start position:0%
too much i didn't think we were supposed
 
03:08:13.600 --> 03:08:15.830 align:start position:0%
too much i didn't think we were supposed
to

03:08:15.830 --> 03:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:17.990 --> 03:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
refer to the body on the other side of
 
03:08:19.910 --> 03:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
the wall and then ask them to do
 
03:08:21.750 --> 03:08:21.760 align:start position:0%
something that we're not sure that they
 
03:08:22.950 --> 03:08:22.960 align:start position:0%
can do
 
03:08:26.870 --> 03:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
we should pass legislation that we think
 
03:08:29.190 --> 03:08:29.200 align:start position:0%
is okay and if they mess with it or
 
03:08:31.110 --> 03:08:31.120 align:start position:0%
change it that's up to them
 
03:08:34.389 --> 03:08:34.399 align:start position:0%
but if we know that this is not correct
 
03:08:48.630 --> 03:08:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:48.640 --> 03:08:50.630 align:start position:0%
 
huh

03:08:50.630 --> 03:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
huh
 
03:08:54.870 --> 03:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:07.510 --> 03:09:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:09.110 --> 03:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
all right i'm pretty sure representative
 
03:09:11.269 --> 03:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
callie pitts to your question that
 
03:09:14.150 --> 03:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
when the bill if this bill should pass
 
03:09:16.389 --> 03:09:16.399 align:start position:0%
both bodies of the legislature when it
 
03:09:19.190 --> 03:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
is enrolled
 
03:09:22.469 --> 03:09:22.479 align:start position:0%
the ols enrollment committee will go
 
03:09:26.389 --> 03:09:26.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:28.389 --> 03:09:28.399 align:start position:0%
editorial errors
 
03:09:30.150 --> 03:09:30.160 align:start position:0%
and i'd be i would be willing to bet
 
03:09:31.990 --> 03:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
that they would see that beginning in
 
03:09:34.550 --> 03:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
2000 as an editorial error and would
 
03:09:36.229 --> 03:09:36.239 align:start position:0%
remove it
 
03:09:39.190 --> 03:09:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:41.990 --> 03:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
representative harrington thank you
 
03:09:43.670 --> 03:09:43.680 align:start position:0%
this isn't highlighted so i'm assuming
 
03:09:45.990 --> 03:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
that as the law exists right now it
 
03:09:49.510 --> 03:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
already says beginning in 2000 the
 
03:09:51.510 --> 03:09:51.520 align:start position:0%
so if that is correct if it's already
 
03:09:53.190 --> 03:09:53.200 align:start position:0%
there we're not we're not changing that
 
03:09:54.309 --> 03:09:54.319 align:start position:0%
part of the law we're changing
 
03:09:55.830 --> 03:09:55.840 align:start position:0%
commission in the department to
 
03:09:57.269 --> 03:09:57.279 align:start position:0%
department of environmental service in
 
03:09:58.950 --> 03:09:58.960 align:start position:0%
the department of energy so we're just
 
03:10:00.790 --> 03:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
leaving that part alone we're not doing
 
03:10:03.429 --> 03:10:03.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:05.990 --> 03:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
that is correct that is correct
 
03:10:06.000 --> 03:10:06.870 align:start position:0%
that is correct that is correct
that

03:10:06.870 --> 03:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:10:08.389 --> 03:10:08.399 align:start position:0%
is not correct
 
03:10:10.070 --> 03:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
representative kelly pitts
 
03:10:12.389 --> 03:10:12.399 align:start position:0%
representative harrington i do believe
 
03:10:12.399 --> 03:10:13.429 align:start position:0%
representative harrington i do believe
that

03:10:13.429 --> 03:10:13.439 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:10:16.150 --> 03:10:16.160 align:start position:0%
you were probably
 
03:10:18.790 --> 03:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
on that second as old as i am
 
03:10:22.150 --> 03:10:22.160 align:start position:0%
because in 2000 what we repealed was
 
03:10:22.160 --> 03:10:23.590 align:start position:0%
because in 2000 what we repealed was
there

03:10:23.590 --> 03:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:10:26.070 --> 03:10:26.080 align:start position:0%
but now we're saying beginning and that
 
03:10:28.389 --> 03:10:28.399 align:start position:0%
wasn't there before
 
03:10:28.399 --> 03:10:29.429 align:start position:0%
wasn't there before
so

03:10:29.429 --> 03:10:29.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:10:32.229 --> 03:10:32.239 align:start position:0%
this legislation was effective
 
03:10:34.550 --> 03:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
in 2000 that's when we had an oversight
 
03:10:34.560 --> 03:10:36.309 align:start position:0%
in 2000 that's when we had an oversight
committee

03:10:36.309 --> 03:10:36.319 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:10:36.319 --> 03:10:37.110 align:start position:0%
committee
not

03:10:37.110 --> 03:10:37.120 align:start position:0%
not
 
03:10:38.229 --> 03:10:38.239 align:start position:0%
so that
 
03:10:41.269 --> 03:10:41.279 align:start position:0%
doesn't hold and i would also point out
 
03:10:43.030 --> 03:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
that ols
 
03:10:44.550 --> 03:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
i assume
 
03:10:48.229 --> 03:10:48.239 align:start position:0%
maybe i shouldn't approve this language
 
03:10:50.070 --> 03:10:50.080 align:start position:0%
you couldn't follow up mr chairman
 
03:10:52.070 --> 03:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
follow up just to try to clarify this
 
03:10:54.630 --> 03:10:54.640 align:start position:0%
thing so i guess my question is what is
 
03:10:56.550 --> 03:10:56.560 align:start position:0%
in the law right now does it say
 
03:10:59.269 --> 03:10:59.279 align:start position:0%
beginning in 2000 the commission in the
 
03:11:01.510 --> 03:11:01.520 align:start position:0%
department yeah okay so if that's
 
03:11:03.429 --> 03:11:03.439 align:start position:0%
already in the law we're not changing it
 
03:11:05.429 --> 03:11:05.439 align:start position:0%
with this amendment because that part of
 
03:11:07.510 --> 03:11:07.520 align:start position:0%
the bill isn't highlighted we're only
 
03:11:09.429 --> 03:11:09.439 align:start position:0%
changing commission and department to
 
03:11:11.110 --> 03:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
department of environmental services and
 
03:11:13.030 --> 03:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
department of energy
 
03:11:14.630 --> 03:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
so i don't understand why there's a
 
03:11:16.070 --> 03:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
problem it's just it's just staying the
 
03:11:18.630 --> 03:11:18.640 align:start position:0%
way it is
 
03:11:20.229 --> 03:11:20.239 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
03:11:23.190 --> 03:11:23.200 align:start position:0%
uh representative occidum thank you
 
03:11:26.229 --> 03:11:26.239 align:start position:0%
when you add in the new words you will
 
03:11:28.630 --> 03:11:28.640 align:start position:0%
change the original meaning at the time
 
03:11:31.269 --> 03:11:31.279 align:start position:0%
this was passed they were saying in the
 
03:11:33.510 --> 03:11:33.520 align:start position:0%
future beginning in
 
03:11:33.520 --> 03:11:35.349 align:start position:0%
future beginning in
2000

03:11:35.349 --> 03:11:35.359 align:start position:0%
2000
 
03:11:37.190 --> 03:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
and they talked about the existing
 
03:11:40.550 --> 03:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
institutions now in 2022 we have
 
03:11:43.269 --> 03:11:43.279 align:start position:0%
different institutions and because we're
 
03:11:46.070 --> 03:11:46.080 align:start position:0%
adding in the name of the a new
 
03:11:48.229 --> 03:11:48.239 align:start position:0%
institution it makes
 
03:11:52.229 --> 03:11:52.239 align:start position:0%
no sense that beginning into it it this
 
03:11:55.030 --> 03:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
it needs to be clarified and i love ols
 
03:11:56.950 --> 03:11:56.960 align:start position:0%
they do a wonderful job but they didn't
 
03:11:59.030 --> 03:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
do such a great job on the last bill we
 
03:12:01.510 --> 03:12:01.520 align:start position:0%
just discussed and this whole issue of
 
03:12:04.070 --> 03:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
going through and changing the do the
 
03:12:04.080 --> 03:12:05.190 align:start position:0%
going through and changing the do the
puc

03:12:05.190 --> 03:12:05.200 align:start position:0%
puc
 
03:12:07.750 --> 03:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
to the department of energy has been
 
03:12:07.760 --> 03:12:08.870 align:start position:0%
to the department of energy has been
fraught

03:12:08.870 --> 03:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
fraught
 
03:12:09.990 --> 03:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
we've spent
 
03:12:13.190 --> 03:12:13.200 align:start position:0%
almost a year i mean hb2 was fraught
 
03:12:16.469 --> 03:12:16.479 align:start position:0%
with these issues we've had puc uh you
 
03:12:18.550 --> 03:12:18.560 align:start position:0%
know the energy storage docket has been
 
03:12:20.469 --> 03:12:20.479 align:start position:0%
held up because you know who's who's in
 
03:12:22.710 --> 03:12:22.720 align:start position:0%
charge here and it's because they they
 
03:12:25.110 --> 03:12:25.120 align:start position:0%
try to global replace everywhere you see
 
03:12:27.670 --> 03:12:27.680 align:start position:0%
puc just stick in d.o.e
 
03:12:29.590 --> 03:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
it doesn't work and it doesn't work in
 
03:12:31.590 --> 03:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
this sentence
 
03:12:31.600 --> 03:12:32.870 align:start position:0%
this sentence
sure

03:12:32.870 --> 03:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
sure
 
03:12:35.110 --> 03:12:35.120 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative thomas
 
03:12:38.710 --> 03:12:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:42.389 --> 03:12:42.399 align:start position:0%
if if the committee wishes if if we
 
03:12:45.429 --> 03:12:45.439 align:start position:0%
strike out the words beginning in 2000
 
03:12:45.439 --> 03:12:46.389 align:start position:0%
strike out the words beginning in 2000
comma

03:12:46.389 --> 03:12:46.399 align:start position:0%
comma
 
03:12:49.590 --> 03:12:49.600 align:start position:0%

03:12:51.910 --> 03:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
department of environmental services
 
03:12:54.630 --> 03:12:54.640 align:start position:0%
yada yada will that satisfy
 
03:12:58.070 --> 03:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:01.269 --> 03:13:01.279 align:start position:0%
representative uh oxenum
 
03:13:03.750 --> 03:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
as an editorial change i i i think that
 
03:13:06.229 --> 03:13:06.239 align:start position:0%
that i could support that but in the
 
03:13:09.030 --> 03:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
larger issue if we ever get back to it i
 
03:13:10.469 --> 03:13:10.479 align:start position:0%
want to know why we're dealing with all
 
03:13:12.870 --> 03:13:12.880 align:start position:0%
these reports when but the point of this
 
03:13:12.880 --> 03:13:13.750 align:start position:0%
these reports when but the point of this
bill

03:13:13.750 --> 03:13:13.760 align:start position:0%

correct okay don't go anywhere anybody
 
03:14:39.279 --> 03:14:40.469 align:start position:0%

you mr chairman just by way of
 
03:15:43.110 --> 03:15:43.120 align:start position:0%
explanation folks because i had i had
 
03:15:44.870 --> 03:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned to my folks earlier that we
 
03:15:47.510 --> 03:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
the plan was to itl this bill so just to
 
03:15:49.510 --> 03:15:49.520 align:start position:0%
clean up clear up any confusion
 
03:15:52.070 --> 03:15:52.080 align:start position:0%
um originally we had agreed that the
 
03:15:54.550 --> 03:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
language in this bill was
 
03:15:56.790 --> 03:15:56.800 align:start position:0%
most easily dealt with by incorporating
 
03:15:58.469 --> 03:15:58.479 align:start position:0%
it into another bill in front of this
 
03:16:02.389 --> 03:16:02.399 align:start position:0%
committee tomorrow which is hb 1258
 
03:16:05.269 --> 03:16:05.279 align:start position:0%
and the um amendment that came back
 
03:16:07.269 --> 03:16:07.279 align:start position:0%
didn't include the language so it was
 
03:16:10.229 --> 03:16:10.239 align:start position:0%
kind of a late-breaking thing and so um
 
03:16:12.150 --> 03:16:12.160 align:start position:0%
just so that we can all be assured that
 
03:16:13.429 --> 03:16:13.439 align:start position:0%
the language actually goes through we're
 
03:16:16.469 --> 03:16:16.479 align:start position:0%
just going to pass it by itself
 
03:16:20.870 --> 03:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
thank you any further discussion on this
 
03:16:25.110 --> 03:16:25.120 align:start position:0%

all right it looks like we're gonna have
 
03:21:19.429 --> 03:21:19.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:22.150 --> 03:21:22.160 align:start position:0%
a bit of a delay here
 
03:21:24.790 --> 03:21:24.800 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
03:21:26.710 --> 03:21:26.720 align:start position:0%
i'm going to try to get a discussion
 
03:21:29.349 --> 03:21:29.359 align:start position:0%
going on the amendment
 
03:21:31.269 --> 03:21:31.279 align:start position:0%
by reading to you
 
03:21:33.510 --> 03:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
the difference between the original bill
 
03:21:35.590 --> 03:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
and the amendment
 
03:21:38.630 --> 03:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
so the original bill read as follows
 
03:21:40.550 --> 03:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
any new hampshire utility customer that
 
03:21:43.670 --> 03:21:43.680 align:start position:0%
requires a power line extension located
 
03:21:45.990 --> 03:21:46.000 align:start position:0%

03:21:48.790 --> 03:21:48.800 align:start position:0%
may hire a contractor who is licensed in
 
03:21:50.950 --> 03:21:50.960 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire
 
03:21:52.790 --> 03:21:52.800 align:start position:0%
and then the words
 
03:21:55.510 --> 03:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
and is approved by the utility were
 
03:21:55.520 --> 03:21:57.910 align:start position:0%
and is approved by the utility were
stricken

03:21:57.910 --> 03:21:57.920 align:start position:0%
stricken
 
03:22:00.389 --> 03:22:00.399 align:start position:0%
or struck
 
03:22:02.790 --> 03:22:02.800 align:start position:0%
strzok is probably more correct
 
03:22:05.349 --> 03:22:05.359 align:start position:0%
was the original bill
 
03:22:07.429 --> 03:22:07.439 align:start position:0%
the amendment says
 
03:22:09.670 --> 03:22:09.680 align:start position:0%
any new hampshire utility customer that
 
03:22:12.150 --> 03:22:12.160 align:start position:0%
requires a power line extension located
 
03:22:14.309 --> 03:22:14.319 align:start position:0%
on private property may hire a
 
03:22:16.630 --> 03:22:16.640 align:start position:0%
contractor who is
 
03:22:19.110 --> 03:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
and then these words were struck
 
03:22:21.110 --> 03:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
licensed in the state of new hampshire
 
03:22:23.110 --> 03:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
and is
 
03:22:27.269 --> 03:22:27.279 align:start position:0%
and the following words were not struck
 
03:22:29.830 --> 03:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
approved by the utility
 
03:22:31.910 --> 03:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
so essentially the difference in the two
 
03:22:33.590 --> 03:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
bills is
 
03:22:35.590 --> 03:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
that a contractor
 
03:22:38.710 --> 03:22:38.720 align:start position:0%
does not have to be licensed but he does
 
03:22:41.750 --> 03:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
have to be approved by the utility
 
03:22:43.349 --> 03:22:43.359 align:start position:0%
that's the difference between the
 
03:22:45.190 --> 03:22:45.200 align:start position:0%
amended version and the introduced
 
03:22:45.200 --> 03:22:46.070 align:start position:0%
amended version and the introduced
version

03:22:46.070 --> 03:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
version
 
03:22:48.389 --> 03:22:48.399 align:start position:0%
so representative pled
 
03:22:50.469 --> 03:22:50.479 align:start position:0%
mr chair this makes eminent sense
 
03:22:50.479 --> 03:22:51.429 align:start position:0%
mr chair this makes eminent sense
because

03:22:51.429 --> 03:22:51.439 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:22:53.269 --> 03:22:53.279 align:start position:0%
line crews are not licensed they're
 
03:22:55.510 --> 03:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
trained by the utilities once they're
 
03:22:57.269 --> 03:22:57.279 align:start position:0%
trained by the utilities they may become
 
03:22:58.870 --> 03:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
independent contractors but they're
 
03:23:00.070 --> 03:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
still trained by the utilities
 
03:23:04.229 --> 03:23:04.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:06.710 --> 03:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
representative oxenom
 
03:23:09.349 --> 03:23:09.359 align:start position:0%
yes as i recall from the public hearing
 
03:23:11.110 --> 03:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
we took us a while to get there but we
 
03:23:13.269 --> 03:23:13.279 align:start position:0%
finally realized there is no such thing
 
03:23:16.070 --> 03:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
as this license that is being required
 
03:23:17.910 --> 03:23:17.920 align:start position:0%
so what we're doing is removing a
 
03:23:20.070 --> 03:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
requirement in the statute for something
 
03:23:21.750 --> 03:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
that doesn't exist it's just
 
03:23:21.760 --> 03:23:24.469 align:start position:0%
that doesn't exist it's just
housekeeping

03:23:24.469 --> 03:23:24.479 align:start position:0%
housekeeping
 
03:23:26.950 --> 03:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
correct representative pementel
 
03:23:29.030 --> 03:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
just a point of order
 
03:23:31.110 --> 03:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
the motion was on the bill not on the
 
03:23:31.120 --> 03:23:32.389 align:start position:0%
the motion was on the bill not on the
amendment

03:23:32.389 --> 03:23:32.399 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
03:23:34.150 --> 03:23:34.160 align:start position:0%
so we're going to have to correct i
 
03:23:35.750 --> 03:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
asked for someone to make a motion on
 
03:23:38.389 --> 03:23:38.399 align:start position:0%
the amendment and no one would
 
03:23:39.990 --> 03:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
accommodate me because they didn't have
 
03:23:42.469 --> 03:23:42.479 align:start position:0%
a copy of the amendment so right i
 
03:23:45.429 --> 03:23:45.439 align:start position:0%
decided to initiate a conversation about
 
03:23:47.030 --> 03:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
the amendment while we're waiting for
 
03:23:49.590 --> 03:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
copies just to save time
 
03:23:51.670 --> 03:23:51.680 align:start position:0%
so don't we don't we have to
 
03:23:54.950 --> 03:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
remove the first motion first
 
03:23:54.960 --> 03:23:56.070 align:start position:0%
remove the first motion first
no

03:23:56.070 --> 03:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
no
 
03:23:56.080 --> 03:23:58.630 align:start position:0%
no
okay

03:23:58.630 --> 03:23:58.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:24:02.309 --> 03:24:02.319 align:start position:0%
okay representative nader is recognized
 
03:24:05.429 --> 03:24:05.439 align:start position:0%
i'll make the motion to um
 
03:24:08.309 --> 03:24:08.319 align:start position:0%
pass the amendment when it gets here
 
03:24:11.030 --> 03:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
okay representative notter has moved the
 
03:24:14.630 --> 03:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
adoption of amendment 01408
 
03:24:16.389 --> 03:24:16.399 align:start position:0%
is there a second second
 
03:24:18.950 --> 03:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
representative thomas seconds the motion
 
03:24:20.630 --> 03:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
now we can have some discussion on the
 
03:24:22.309 --> 03:24:22.319 align:start position:0%
motion while we wait for copies of the
 
03:24:24.870 --> 03:24:24.880 align:start position:0%
amendment representative callie pitts
 
03:24:26.469 --> 03:24:26.479 align:start position:0%
i thought we could still have some
 
03:24:28.229 --> 03:24:28.239 align:start position:0%
informal discussion but i'd like a
 
03:24:28.239 --> 03:24:29.990 align:start position:0%
informal discussion but i'd like a
clarification

03:24:29.990 --> 03:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
03:24:32.229 --> 03:24:32.239 align:start position:0%
when we say licensed and we say
 
03:24:35.670 --> 03:24:35.680 align:start position:0%
contractor and from my own mind
 
03:24:39.110 --> 03:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
this would be a contractor to lay
 
03:24:40.790 --> 03:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
the conduit
 
03:24:42.790 --> 03:24:42.800 align:start position:0%
if that's what they're doing but not
 
03:24:45.349 --> 03:24:45.359 align:start position:0%
attached to the poles
 
03:24:45.359 --> 03:24:47.830 align:start position:0%
attached to the poles
because

03:24:47.830 --> 03:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:24:50.469 --> 03:24:50.479 align:start position:0%
i i would believe that you need an
 
03:24:52.830 --> 03:24:52.840 align:start position:0%
electrician to connect to
 
03:24:52.840 --> 03:24:54.469 align:start position:0%
electrician to connect to
electricity

03:24:54.469 --> 03:24:54.479 align:start position:0%
electricity
 
03:24:57.110 --> 03:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
uh we even do that for solar panels we
 
03:24:59.349 --> 03:24:59.359 align:start position:0%
require an electrician
 
03:24:59.359 --> 03:25:00.150 align:start position:0%
require an electrician
to

03:25:00.150 --> 03:25:00.160 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:25:02.870 --> 03:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
connect the solar panels so
 
03:25:05.910 --> 03:25:05.920 align:start position:0%
i'm confused on that and
 
03:25:07.750 --> 03:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
a lot you need a licensed electrician
 
03:25:10.550 --> 03:25:10.560 align:start position:0%
when you put in solar panels
 
03:25:12.630 --> 03:25:12.640 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
03:25:14.870 --> 03:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
what are we talking about are we talking
 
03:25:18.950 --> 03:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
about connecting and attaching to a pole
 
03:25:20.870 --> 03:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
i'm guessing that the original
 
03:25:24.389 --> 03:25:24.399 align:start position:0%
legislation contained the words
 
03:25:26.870 --> 03:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
licensed in the state of new hampshire
 
03:25:28.870 --> 03:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
to cover
 
03:25:31.269 --> 03:25:31.279 align:start position:0%
the fact that an electrician would be a
 
03:25:33.510 --> 03:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
licensed electrician would be required
 
03:25:33.520 --> 03:25:34.389 align:start position:0%
licensed electrician would be required
to

03:25:34.389 --> 03:25:34.399 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:25:35.510 --> 03:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
hook up the
 
03:25:37.750 --> 03:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
the power to the pole
 
03:25:37.760 --> 03:25:39.510 align:start position:0%
the power to the pole
however

03:25:39.510 --> 03:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
however
 
03:25:42.070 --> 03:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
anybody who's approved by a utility to
 
03:25:45.030 --> 03:25:45.040 align:start position:0%
do this work i would think
 
03:25:47.429 --> 03:25:47.439 align:start position:0%
would have to be the utility wouldn't
 
03:25:49.110 --> 03:25:49.120 align:start position:0%
approve that person unless they were
 
03:25:52.550 --> 03:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:54.229 --> 03:25:54.239 align:start position:0%
no license
 
03:25:55.510 --> 03:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
so are we going to go around on this
 
03:25:59.269 --> 03:25:59.279 align:start position:0%
again i i don't know i mean
 
03:26:01.269 --> 03:26:01.279 align:start position:0%
may i follow up okay representative
 
03:26:04.950 --> 03:26:04.960 align:start position:0%
kelly i'm just trying to get straight in
 
03:26:06.790 --> 03:26:06.800 align:start position:0%
my mind
 
03:26:09.349 --> 03:26:09.359 align:start position:0%
what these people are doing are they
 
03:26:12.550 --> 03:26:12.560 align:start position:0%
actually connecting to the live
 
03:26:14.389 --> 03:26:14.399 align:start position:0%
power lines and making an
 
03:26:14.399 --> 03:26:16.550 align:start position:0%
power lines and making an
interconnection

03:26:16.550 --> 03:26:16.560 align:start position:0%
interconnection
 
03:26:20.309 --> 03:26:20.319 align:start position:0%
that's what it sounds like to me
 
03:26:22.389 --> 03:26:22.399 align:start position:0%
and it sounds like to me
 
03:26:25.269 --> 03:26:25.279 align:start position:0%
then that anybody
 
03:26:25.279 --> 03:26:26.710 align:start position:0%
then that anybody
uh

03:26:26.710 --> 03:26:26.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:26:28.950 --> 03:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
could do this without being properly
 
03:26:28.960 --> 03:26:30.309 align:start position:0%
could do this without being properly
trained

03:26:30.309 --> 03:26:30.319 align:start position:0%
trained
 
03:26:34.389 --> 03:26:34.399 align:start position:0%
and i know approved by the utility but
 
03:26:36.229 --> 03:26:36.239 align:start position:0%
how many people are out there working
 
03:26:39.269 --> 03:26:39.279 align:start position:0%
and are not approved by the utility
 
03:26:42.150 --> 03:26:42.160 align:start position:0%
representative sykes has a comment
 
03:26:43.750 --> 03:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
uh yeah this is right thank you mr
 
03:26:45.590 --> 03:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
chairman i actually have a tiny bit of
 
03:26:48.150 --> 03:26:48.160 align:start position:0%
expertise about this having been as a
 
03:26:51.030 --> 03:26:51.040 align:start position:0%
fire inspector for almost 30 years and
 
03:26:53.190 --> 03:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
also the city's electrical inspector for
 
03:26:54.469 --> 03:26:54.479 align:start position:0%
a short while
 
03:26:57.269 --> 03:26:57.279 align:start position:0%
when we didn't have one um
 
03:27:00.790 --> 03:27:00.800 align:start position:0%
electrical licenses count from the
 
03:27:03.110 --> 03:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
meter in
 
03:27:06.309 --> 03:27:06.319 align:start position:0%
they don't count from the drop
 
03:27:08.630 --> 03:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
from the power utilities so there is no
 
03:27:10.309 --> 03:27:10.319 align:start position:0%
license and there is not there is no
 
03:27:12.469 --> 03:27:12.479 align:start position:0%
requirement for one
 
03:27:14.229 --> 03:27:14.239 align:start position:0%
training is obviously required which
 
03:27:17.110 --> 03:27:17.120 align:start position:0%
this amendment would uh would do
 
03:27:19.110 --> 03:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
but anyways there's no there
 
03:27:20.630 --> 03:27:20.640 align:start position:0%
to answer
 
03:27:20.640 --> 03:27:21.349 align:start position:0%
to answer
the

03:27:21.349 --> 03:27:21.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:27:22.870 --> 03:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
there is no license there is no
 
03:27:24.550 --> 03:27:24.560 align:start position:0%
requirement for a license the license
 
03:27:26.389 --> 03:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
that you all refer to as the electrical
 
03:27:29.510 --> 03:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
license applies to work with after the
 
03:27:29.520 --> 03:27:31.030 align:start position:0%
license applies to work with after the
meter

03:27:31.030 --> 03:27:31.040 align:start position:0%
meter
 
03:27:32.469 --> 03:27:32.479 align:start position:0%
thank you for that clarification
 
03:27:34.469 --> 03:27:34.479 align:start position:0%
representative lewicki
 
03:27:36.070 --> 03:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman this would be a
 
03:27:38.710 --> 03:27:38.720 align:start position:0%
further clarification where i live it is
 
03:27:40.790 --> 03:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
typical for people to build a house at
 
03:27:43.030 --> 03:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
the end of a quarter mile driveway
 
03:27:44.550 --> 03:27:44.560 align:start position:0%
when they do that they will have a
 
03:27:47.670 --> 03:27:47.680 align:start position:0%
transformer and a meter at the house and
 
03:27:49.750 --> 03:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
a high voltage line will go from the
 
03:27:51.750 --> 03:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
existing high voltage line using new
 
03:27:53.510 --> 03:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
poles or whatever
 
03:27:56.389 --> 03:27:56.399 align:start position:0%
to that transformer and that is i
 
03:27:57.590 --> 03:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
believe what we're talking about is
 
03:28:00.389 --> 03:28:00.399 align:start position:0%
bridging that gap between the
 
03:28:02.309 --> 03:28:02.319 align:start position:0%
power lines that the power company puts
 
03:28:04.550 --> 03:28:04.560 align:start position:0%
up and maintains and allowing a
 
03:28:06.070 --> 03:28:06.080 align:start position:0%
connection to that which the power
 
03:28:09.030 --> 03:28:09.040 align:start position:0%
company would actually make
 
03:28:13.990 --> 03:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:16.389 --> 03:28:16.399 align:start position:0%
when i have the attention of the floor
 
03:28:16.399 --> 03:28:18.469 align:start position:0%
when i have the attention of the floor
um

03:28:18.469 --> 03:28:18.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:28:20.790 --> 03:28:20.800 align:start position:0%
mr sykes representative sykes was right
 
03:28:21.830 --> 03:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
on the money
 
03:28:24.229 --> 03:28:24.239 align:start position:0%
uh when you don't need electrician to
 
03:28:26.630 --> 03:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
attach to a pole that's line work and
 
03:28:29.110 --> 03:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
the utility will only hire line workers
 
03:28:31.110 --> 03:28:31.120 align:start position:0%
that were trained by themselves or other
 
03:28:31.120 --> 03:28:34.469 align:start position:0%
that were trained by themselves or other
utilities

03:28:34.469 --> 03:28:34.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:36.710 --> 03:28:36.720 align:start position:0%

point of order
 
03:28:46.870 --> 03:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
um is it possible to have in the motion
 
03:28:49.349 --> 03:28:49.359 align:start position:0%

that amendment that had to be passed out
 
03:31:22.389 --> 03:31:22.399 align:start position:0%
to anyone somehow i had that which
 
03:31:24.469 --> 03:31:24.479 align:start position:0%
when representative brody spoke i even
 
03:31:27.269 --> 03:31:27.279 align:start position:0%
have notes on him and it was closed at 3
 
03:31:31.269 --> 03:31:31.279 align:start position:0%
55 pm on that date so i was confused on
 
03:31:33.269 --> 03:31:33.279 align:start position:0%
now why everyone else doesn't have what
 
03:31:35.670 --> 03:31:35.680 align:start position:0%
i had in my hand
 
03:31:35.680 --> 03:31:36.630 align:start position:0%

i shall do so mr chair
 
03:32:32.150 --> 03:32:32.160 align:start position:0%
is there some confusion before i call
 
03:32:34.469 --> 03:32:34.479 align:start position:0%
the roll
 
03:32:35.990 --> 03:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
i had one other question i was trying to
 
03:32:38.389 --> 03:32:38.399 align:start position:0%
ask representative lewicky anita
 
03:32:40.710 --> 03:32:40.720 align:start position:0%
couldn't hear me if if something goes
 
03:32:43.030 --> 03:32:43.040 align:start position:0%
wrong with this who's liable
 
03:32:45.990 --> 03:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
if something goes wrong with this
 
03:32:48.389 --> 03:32:48.399 align:start position:0%
extension the contractor is it the
 
03:32:52.309 --> 03:32:52.319 align:start position:0%
contractor who is not licensed who
 
03:32:53.429 --> 03:32:53.439 align:start position:0%
may not
 
03:32:55.750 --> 03:32:55.760 align:start position:0%
be required to have insurance or is it
 
03:32:57.349 --> 03:32:57.359 align:start position:0%
the utility
 
03:32:57.359 --> 03:32:58.309 align:start position:0%
the utility
and

03:32:58.309 --> 03:32:58.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:33:01.429 --> 03:33:01.439 align:start position:0%
it's just a question and
 
03:33:04.229 --> 03:33:04.239 align:start position:0%
it occurred to me because i i still see
 
03:33:07.110 --> 03:33:07.120 align:start position:0%
somebody doing an extension
 
03:33:09.750 --> 03:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
not maybe connecting to the home
 
03:33:11.830 --> 03:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
but bringing it into the power bringing
 
03:33:14.070 --> 03:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
it into from the main power line
 
03:33:17.030 --> 03:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
who's responsible on this
 
03:33:18.950 --> 03:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
uh just a question
 
03:33:20.229 --> 03:33:20.239 align:start position:0%
it's an interesting question
 
03:33:22.550 --> 03:33:22.560 align:start position:0%
representative lewicki mr chairman i
 
03:33:24.229 --> 03:33:24.239 align:start position:0%
cannot speak with certainty but i would
 
03:33:26.150 --> 03:33:26.160 align:start position:0%
expect that before the power company
 
03:33:27.910 --> 03:33:27.920 align:start position:0%
would allow such a thing to be connected
 
03:33:31.510 --> 03:33:31.520 align:start position:0%
they would do an inspection on their own
 
03:33:32.790 --> 03:33:32.800 align:start position:0%
i agree
 
03:33:35.190 --> 03:33:35.200 align:start position:0%
the contractor would be liable for any
 
03:33:35.200 --> 03:33:36.070 align:start position:0%
the contractor would be liable for any
issues

03:33:36.070 --> 03:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
issues
 
03:33:37.670 --> 03:33:37.680 align:start position:0%
representative thomas
 
03:33:40.950 --> 03:33:40.960 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you mr chair uh again uh
 
03:33:43.030 --> 03:33:43.040 align:start position:0%
not speaking with any authority but
 
03:33:44.229 --> 03:33:44.239 align:start position:0%
looking with
 
03:33:48.150 --> 03:33:48.160 align:start position:0%
past example if a utility approves a
 
03:33:51.190 --> 03:33:51.200 align:start position:0%
contractor to perform work and that
 
03:33:51.200 --> 03:33:52.550 align:start position:0%
contractor to perform work and that
contractor

03:33:52.550 --> 03:33:52.560 align:start position:0%
contractor
 
03:33:55.830 --> 03:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
performs it badly and makes a mistake
 
03:33:58.550 --> 03:33:58.560 align:start position:0%
i believe the liability would be both on
 
03:34:01.269 --> 03:34:01.279 align:start position:0%
the contractor and the utility and one
 
03:34:03.590 --> 03:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
example we can use on this is back a few
 
03:34:05.670 --> 03:34:05.680 align:start position:0%
years ago when
 
03:34:07.429 --> 03:34:07.439 align:start position:0%
forget the name of the gas company but
 
03:34:09.269 --> 03:34:09.279 align:start position:0%
in lawrence massachusetts when they had
 
03:34:12.830 --> 03:34:12.840 align:start position:0%
that tremendous tragedy
 
03:34:14.710 --> 03:34:14.720 align:start position:0%
contractor was
 
03:34:16.389 --> 03:34:16.399 align:start position:0%
very badly
 
03:34:19.110 --> 03:34:19.120 align:start position:0%
trained i guess but the liability is
 
03:34:21.590 --> 03:34:21.600 align:start position:0%
going back to the contractor and the and
 
03:34:23.349 --> 03:34:23.359 align:start position:0%
the main gas company so
 
03:34:25.190 --> 03:34:25.200 align:start position:0%
you are responsible if you hire a
 
03:34:27.510 --> 03:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
contractor and you approve him to hire

seeing no objection
 
03:36:03.110 --> 03:36:03.120 align:start position:0%
so ruled
 
03:36:04.870 --> 03:36:04.880 align:start position:0%
and that closes the public hearing on
 
03:36:08.150 --> 03:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
house bill 13 of the executive session
 
03:36:12.710 --> 03:36:12.720 align:start position:0%

03:36:14.950 --> 03:36:14.960 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:36:17.910 --> 03:36:17.920 align:start position:0%

03:36:26.870 --> 03:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:36:28.630 --> 03:36:28.640 align:start position:0%
so we don't have an estimate all right
 
03:36:29.670 --> 03:36:29.680 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:36:31.429 --> 03:36:31.439 align:start position:0%
all right well we'll move on next then
 
03:36:31.439 --> 03:36:32.630 align:start position:0%
all right well we'll move on next then
to

03:36:32.630 --> 03:36:32.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:36:35.429 --> 03:36:35.439 align:start position:0%
the next bill on our list which will be
 
03:36:37.830 --> 03:36:37.840 align:start position:0%
the next to last bill
 
03:36:40.229 --> 03:36:40.239 align:start position:0%
and so i will open the public hearing on
 
03:36:44.150 --> 03:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:46.229 --> 03:36:46.239 align:start position:0%
relative to recycling
 
03:36:48.710 --> 03:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
solar panels and i will recognize
 
03:36:51.670 --> 03:36:51.680 align:start position:0%
representative platt
 
03:36:53.670 --> 03:36:53.680 align:start position:0%
i move to adopt
 
03:37:00.229 --> 03:37:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:02.469 --> 03:37:02.479 align:start position:0%
is there a second and i have copies in
 
03:37:05.670 --> 03:37:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:07.349 --> 03:37:07.359 align:start position:0%
representative not our seconds the
 
03:37:07.359 --> 03:37:09.349 align:start position:0%

motion
 
03:37:11.750 --> 03:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
and we will now pass out these copies so
 
03:37:24.150 --> 03:37:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:26.389 --> 03:37:26.399 align:start position:0%
while it's being passed out what this
 
03:37:28.950 --> 03:37:28.960 align:start position:0%
amendment does is to replace the bill up
 
03:37:31.030 --> 03:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
other than the introductory class and
 
03:37:33.670 --> 03:37:33.680 align:start position:0%
the only change in the replacement is to
 
03:37:36.070 --> 03:37:36.080 align:start position:0%
substitute the word retailer for
 
03:37:38.710 --> 03:37:38.720 align:start position:0%
manufacturer and that way we're chasing
 
03:37:41.349 --> 03:37:41.359 align:start position:0%
local people not somebody in china or
 
03:37:41.359 --> 03:37:43.269 align:start position:0%
local people not somebody in china or
elsewhere

03:37:43.269 --> 03:37:43.279 align:start position:0%
elsewhere
 
03:37:45.030 --> 03:37:45.040 align:start position:0%

03:37:48.870 --> 03:37:48.880 align:start position:0%
bill drafted but ols missed my email

i got it fixed
 
03:38:03.590 --> 03:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:05.510 --> 03:38:05.520 align:start position:0%

shopping
 
03:42:25.670 --> 03:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
so so the amendment is just
 
03:42:27.189 --> 03:42:27.199 align:start position:0%
we can get to the substance in the
 
03:42:29.269 --> 03:42:29.279 align:start position:0%
actual bill but this substitutes
 
03:42:33.349 --> 03:42:33.359 align:start position:0%
retailer for manufacturer that's it
 
03:42:35.590 --> 03:42:35.600 align:start position:0%
well any discussion prior to the
 
03:42:37.750 --> 03:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
adoption of the amendment has to be
 
03:42:40.550 --> 03:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
about the amendment itself
 
03:42:40.560 --> 03:42:41.349 align:start position:0%
about the amendment itself
so

03:42:41.349 --> 03:42:41.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:42:43.670 --> 03:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
representative occidum you have a
 
03:42:46.070 --> 03:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
comment about the amendment
 
03:42:48.550 --> 03:42:48.560 align:start position:0%
i think i just got ruled out of order i
 
03:42:49.990 --> 03:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
was hoping that we could discuss the
 
03:42:52.950 --> 03:42:52.960 align:start position:0%
bills and the amendment doesn't offer
 
03:42:55.030 --> 03:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
much grounds for
 
03:42:55.040 --> 03:42:57.110 align:start position:0%
much grounds for
interest

03:42:57.110 --> 03:42:57.120 align:start position:0%
interest

03:43:18.870 --> 03:43:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:20.229 --> 03:43:20.239 align:start position:0%
she would have been wondering if we'd
 
03:43:22.150 --> 03:43:22.160 align:start position:0%
have done that
 
03:43:23.910 --> 03:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
okay raise your hand if you need a copy
 
03:43:28.070 --> 03:43:28.080 align:start position:0%

everyone who needs a copy of the
 
03:43:29.359 --> 03:43:31.750 align:start position:0%
everyone who needs a copy of the
amendment

03:43:31.750 --> 03:43:31.760 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
03:43:45.269 --> 03:43:45.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:14.950 --> 03:44:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:17.030 --> 03:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
all right does everybody now have a copy
 
03:44:22.469 --> 03:44:22.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:31.090 --> 03:44:31.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:31.100 --> 03:44:34.710 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

03:44:34.710 --> 03:44:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:37.189 --> 03:44:37.199 align:start position:0%
as i read this it says that we're
 
03:44:39.990 --> 03:44:40.000 align:start position:0%
amending the bill by replacing all with
 
03:44:42.309 --> 03:44:42.319 align:start position:0%
the following
 
03:44:42.319 --> 03:44:43.269 align:start position:0%
the following
so

03:44:43.269 --> 03:44:43.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:44:44.469 --> 03:44:44.479 align:start position:0%
in fact
 
03:44:46.950 --> 03:44:46.960 align:start position:0%
the the issue in
 
03:44:50.469 --> 03:44:50.479 align:start position:0%
by passing this we we render moot
 
03:44:52.469 --> 03:44:52.479 align:start position:0%
the bill i mean the discussion of
 
03:44:54.950 --> 03:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
whether or not we should have this bill
 
03:44:54.960 --> 03:44:55.750 align:start position:0%
whether or not we should have this bill
is

03:44:55.750 --> 03:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:44:57.990 --> 03:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate to discuss now because this
 
03:45:01.189 --> 03:45:01.199 align:start position:0%
amendment is replacing the entire text
 
03:45:03.830 --> 03:45:03.840 align:start position:0%
with this text
 
03:45:06.229 --> 03:45:06.239 align:start position:0%
technically that is correct so if you
 
03:45:08.790 --> 03:45:08.800 align:start position:0%
would like to discuss the
 
03:45:10.870 --> 03:45:10.880 align:start position:0%
amended bill
 
03:45:13.030 --> 03:45:13.040 align:start position:0%
which would be this amendment then i
 
03:45:15.269 --> 03:45:15.279 align:start position:0%
suppose that would be appropriate
 
03:45:17.910 --> 03:45:17.920 align:start position:0%
representative plett i disagree but you
 
03:45:19.910 --> 03:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
your chair rules of course but we're
 
03:45:21.750 --> 03:45:21.760 align:start position:0%
just replacing manufacturing with the
 
03:45:23.349 --> 03:45:23.359 align:start position:0%
retailer we still have to discuss the
 
03:45:25.030 --> 03:45:25.040 align:start position:0%
bill as amended and you can have every
 
03:45:30.790 --> 03:45:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:33.670 --> 03:45:33.680 align:start position:0%
i suppose technically you are correct
 
03:45:35.750 --> 03:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
let's let's let's amend the bill and
 
03:45:39.030 --> 03:45:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:40.469 --> 03:45:40.479 align:start position:0%
let's amend the bill and then discuss
 
03:45:43.030 --> 03:45:43.040 align:start position:0%
the amended bill so
 
03:45:44.469 --> 03:45:44.479 align:start position:0%
i'm going to ask the clerk to call the
 
03:45:46.229 --> 03:45:46.239 align:start position:0%

motion oh i second the motion first it's
 
03:47:32.870 --> 03:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
been moved and seconded that we adopt
 
03:47:36.229 --> 03:47:36.239 align:start position:0%
the amended version of house bill 1459
 
03:47:37.910 --> 03:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
fn and representative platt is
 
03:47:37.920 --> 03:47:40.870 align:start position:0%
fn and representative platt is
recognized

03:47:40.870 --> 03:47:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:44.469 --> 03:47:44.479 align:start position:0%
small electronics already have a program
 
03:47:46.950 --> 03:47:46.960 align:start position:0%
through and municipalities
 
03:47:48.630 --> 03:47:48.640 align:start position:0%
for recycling
 
03:47:50.710 --> 03:47:50.720 align:start position:0%
most larger facilities go to a site
 
03:47:53.349 --> 03:47:53.359 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee and they have they
 
03:47:56.229 --> 03:47:56.239 align:start position:0%
have imposed a recycling end of end of
 
03:47:57.269 --> 03:47:57.279 align:start position:0%
end of
 
03:47:59.670 --> 03:47:59.680 align:start position:0%
term recycling
 
03:48:02.150 --> 03:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
solar panels don't necessarily go
 
03:48:04.150 --> 03:48:04.160 align:start position:0%
through a site evaluation committee
 
03:48:05.990 --> 03:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
because they may be on homeowners roofs
 
03:48:08.150 --> 03:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
and they may be smaller
 
03:48:10.710 --> 03:48:10.720 align:start position:0%
and so that's the purpose of this any
 
03:48:13.269 --> 03:48:13.279 align:start position:0%
facility within new hampshire of any
 
03:48:16.070 --> 03:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
size should have a end of life plan
 
03:48:16.080 --> 03:48:16.950 align:start position:0%
size should have a end of life plan
and

03:48:16.950 --> 03:48:16.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:48:18.229 --> 03:48:18.239 align:start position:0%
this these
 
03:48:19.990 --> 03:48:20.000 align:start position:0%
solar panels
 
03:48:22.389 --> 03:48:22.399 align:start position:0%
a lot of it's glass no big deal
 
03:48:23.830 --> 03:48:23.840 align:start position:0%
uh but
 
03:48:26.630 --> 03:48:26.640 align:start position:0%
but a lot of it is uh heavy metals and
 
03:48:28.070 --> 03:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
there's all sorts of stuff in there
 
03:48:31.030 --> 03:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
selenium lanthanum cerium presodium
 
03:48:32.870 --> 03:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
neodymium i'm not going to promote some
 
03:48:34.950 --> 03:48:34.960 align:start position:0%
of the others but they they have to be
 
03:48:37.030 --> 03:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
carefully sorted out and recycled it's
 
03:48:38.870 --> 03:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
somewhat of an elaborate process
 
03:48:41.110 --> 03:48:41.120 align:start position:0%
recognize that cost up front and the
 
03:48:43.429 --> 03:48:43.439 align:start position:0%
only opposition when this occurred was
 
03:48:44.870 --> 03:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
from one solar representative who
 
03:48:46.630 --> 03:48:46.640 align:start position:0%
essentially said let's kick the can down
 
03:48:48.389 --> 03:48:48.399 align:start position:0%
the road we don't need to do it now but
 
03:48:51.750 --> 03:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
we do need to do it now thank you
 
03:48:53.830 --> 03:48:53.840 align:start position:0%
further discussion on the motion to
 
03:48:53.840 --> 03:48:55.030 align:start position:0%

looking at this bill it sounds as if
 
03:49:09.510 --> 03:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
what we've done is it's up to the people
 
03:49:11.750 --> 03:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
selling the solar panels to have a
 
03:49:13.910 --> 03:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
program set up for recycling at end of
 
03:49:13.920 --> 03:49:14.790 align:start position:0%
program set up for recycling at end of
life

03:49:14.790 --> 03:49:14.800 align:start position:0%
life
 
03:49:16.630 --> 03:49:16.640 align:start position:0%
but you know in today's world i go on
 
03:49:19.030 --> 03:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
the internet i find a solar panel i want
 
03:49:21.429 --> 03:49:21.439 align:start position:0%
to buy from mexico
 
03:49:24.229 --> 03:49:24.239 align:start position:0%

truck and it shows up in my house a
 
03:49:27.590 --> 03:49:27.600 align:start position:0%
couple of days later how is the

that's for the department of energy to
 
03:49:40.550 --> 03:49:40.560 align:start position:0%
work out but if there's a solar panel
 
03:49:40.560 --> 03:49:41.990 align:start position:0%
work out but if there's a solar panel
retailer

03:49:41.990 --> 03:49:42.000 align:start position:0%

the department of energy approval with
 
03:49:51.110 --> 03:49:51.120 align:start position:0%
the recycling plan period
 
03:49:52.389 --> 03:49:52.399 align:start position:0%
i understand that but how is the
 
03:49:54.070 --> 03:49:54.080 align:start position:0%
department of energy going to know about
 
03:49:55.349 --> 03:49:55.359 align:start position:0%
fred's uh
 
03:49:58.389 --> 03:49:58.399 align:start position:0%
uh gas station and solar panels down in
 
03:50:00.469 --> 03:50:00.479 align:start position:0%
some place in mexico i look them up on
 
03:50:02.229 --> 03:50:02.239 align:start position:0%
the internet they ship when i send them
 
03:50:03.349 --> 03:50:03.359 align:start position:0%
the money
 
03:50:04.950 --> 03:50:04.960 align:start position:0%
i don't i just i'm trying to figure out
 
03:50:06.550 --> 03:50:06.560 align:start position:0%
how this is enforceable a lot of the
 
03:50:08.630 --> 03:50:08.640 align:start position:0%
things we have now are like you have to
 
03:50:10.389 --> 03:50:10.399 align:start position:0%
recycle like a battery because if you
 
03:50:11.670 --> 03:50:11.680 align:start position:0%
want to buy a new battery you have to
 
03:50:13.110 --> 03:50:13.120 align:start position:0%
turn in the old one or they're going to
 
03:50:14.469 --> 03:50:14.479 align:start position:0%
charge you for it
 
03:50:15.590 --> 03:50:15.600 align:start position:0%
or other things like that i'm just
 
03:50:17.510 --> 03:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out how the department
 
03:50:19.269 --> 03:50:19.279 align:start position:0%
of energy is even going to know that i'm
 
03:50:21.590 --> 03:50:21.600 align:start position:0%
buying solar panels from somebody in
 
03:50:22.950 --> 03:50:22.960 align:start position:0%
mexico and putting them up on my
 
03:50:25.189 --> 03:50:25.199 align:start position:0%
backyard i mean there's no requirement
 
03:50:27.590 --> 03:50:27.600 align:start position:0%
for me to report to them on it and
 
03:50:29.750 --> 03:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
presumably the company could
 
03:50:31.429 --> 03:50:31.439 align:start position:0%
just sell me the panels i put them up
 
03:50:33.830 --> 03:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
and no one knows the difference okay mr
 
03:50:33.840 --> 03:50:34.790 align:start position:0%
and no one knows the difference okay mr
ch

03:50:34.790 --> 03:50:34.800 align:start position:0%
ch
 
03:50:36.950 --> 03:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
in response mr chair may i
 
03:50:39.429 --> 03:50:39.439 align:start position:0%
follow up go ahead page three
 
03:50:41.510 --> 03:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
lines twenty eight through thirty one
 
03:50:43.830 --> 03:50:43.840 align:start position:0%
part no distributor retailer installer
 
03:50:46.150 --> 03:50:46.160 align:start position:0%

03:50:47.670 --> 03:50:47.680 align:start position:0%

module into the state unless the
retailer

03:50:48.710 --> 03:50:48.720 align:start position:0%
retailer
 
03:50:50.790 --> 03:50:50.800 align:start position:0%
of of the module has submitted to the
 
03:50:52.710 --> 03:50:52.720 align:start position:0%
department of stewardship plan now that
 
03:50:55.349 --> 03:50:55.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't get to the enforcement the 31 on
 
03:50:56.950 --> 03:50:56.960 align:start position:0%
gets the enforcement department shall
 
03:50:58.630 --> 03:50:58.640 align:start position:0%
send a written warning to a retailer is
 
03:51:00.790 --> 03:51:00.800 align:start position:0%
not participating in a plan the written
 
03:51:03.030 --> 03:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
warning shall inform the retailer that
 
03:51:04.950 --> 03:51:04.960 align:start position:0%
shall be submitted plan or participate
 
03:51:06.950 --> 03:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
in playing within 30 days of the notice
 
03:51:08.469 --> 03:51:08.479 align:start position:0%
the department may assess a penalty up
 
03:51:10.710 --> 03:51:10.720 align:start position:0%
to ten thousand dollars upon a retailer
 
03:51:12.229 --> 03:51:12.239 align:start position:0%
for each sale
 
03:51:13.750 --> 03:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
and if that doesn't work i guess it's a
 
03:51:13.760 --> 03:51:15.990 align:start position:0%
and if that doesn't work i guess it's a
lawsuit

03:51:15.990 --> 03:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
lawsuit
 
03:51:17.030 --> 03:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
03:51:19.830 --> 03:51:19.840 align:start position:0%
follow up yeah see that that's my point
 
03:51:21.429 --> 03:51:21.439 align:start position:0%
again we've got someone from the
 
03:51:22.790 --> 03:51:22.800 align:start position:0%
department of energy are they going to
 
03:51:24.790 --> 03:51:24.800 align:start position:0%
be monitoring all internet sites for
 
03:51:26.790 --> 03:51:26.800 align:start position:0%
looking for people that may be selling
 
03:51:28.630 --> 03:51:28.640 align:start position:0%
solar panels for any place across the
 
03:51:30.309 --> 03:51:30.319 align:start position:0%
world how would they even know that
 
03:51:31.670 --> 03:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
somebody in new hampshire had bought a
 
03:51:34.070 --> 03:51:34.080 align:start position:0%
solar panel and who they bought it from
 
03:51:36.309 --> 03:51:36.319 align:start position:0%
because there's no upfront there's no
 
03:51:38.150 --> 03:51:38.160 align:start position:0%
national registration or whatever that
 
03:51:40.790 --> 03:51:40.800 align:start position:0%
i'm aware of so this this law is out
 
03:51:43.269 --> 03:51:43.279 align:start position:0%
there but the guy in mexico doesn't even
 
03:51:44.550 --> 03:51:44.560 align:start position:0%
know it exists
 
03:51:46.309 --> 03:51:46.319 align:start position:0%
and if someone goes on the internet the
 
03:51:47.590 --> 03:51:47.600 align:start position:0%
average homeowner is not going to know
 
03:51:48.710 --> 03:51:48.720 align:start position:0%
it exists
 
03:51:50.550 --> 03:51:50.560 align:start position:0%
so they just order their their solar
 
03:51:52.229 --> 03:51:52.239 align:start position:0%
panels and they show up and they install
 
03:51:54.229 --> 03:51:54.239 align:start position:0%
them and i just i don't see how this is
 
03:51:55.910 --> 03:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
enforceable and i don't see where the
 
03:51:57.590 --> 03:51:57.600 align:start position:0%
department of energy is going to be able
 
03:52:00.630 --> 03:52:00.640 align:start position:0%
to impose fines on
 
03:52:02.710 --> 03:52:02.720 align:start position:0%
companies in other countries
 
03:52:04.469 --> 03:52:04.479 align:start position:0%
respond again sure
 
03:52:05.910 --> 03:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead
 
03:52:09.229 --> 03:52:09.239 align:start position:0%
page 2 149 m63
 
03:52:11.510 --> 03:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
9910 the department shall develop
 
03:52:13.349 --> 03:52:13.359 align:start position:0%
guidance for module stewardship program
 
03:52:15.510 --> 03:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
take back program etc
 
03:52:17.910 --> 03:52:17.920 align:start position:0%
uh and it lays out there
 
03:52:20.389 --> 03:52:20.399 align:start position:0%
but my point
 
03:52:22.469 --> 03:52:22.479 align:start position:0%
with due respect representative herring
 
03:52:25.510 --> 03:52:25.520 align:start position:0%
you say do do nothing
 
03:52:26.710 --> 03:52:26.720 align:start position:0%
let it happen
 
03:52:30.550 --> 03:52:30.560 align:start position:0%
have these things uh proliferate
 
03:52:32.550 --> 03:52:32.560 align:start position:0%
if i can respond to that mr chairman yes
 
03:52:34.710 --> 03:52:34.720 align:start position:0%
go ahead what i'm saying is that you've
 
03:52:37.189 --> 03:52:37.199 align:start position:0%
identified a real problem i agree but
 
03:52:39.030 --> 03:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure this is a real solution
 
03:52:41.510 --> 03:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
because it's just a paper tiger there's
 
03:52:43.830 --> 03:52:43.840 align:start position:0%
no enforcement mechanism and i don't see
 
03:52:45.349 --> 03:52:45.359 align:start position:0%
how the department of energy is going to
 
03:52:47.110 --> 03:52:47.120 align:start position:0%
be able to patrol the world for solar
 
03:52:49.030 --> 03:52:49.040 align:start position:0%
panels coming into new hampshire where
 
03:52:50.710 --> 03:52:50.720 align:start position:0%
literally that's the market you can buy
 
03:52:53.670 --> 03:52:53.680 align:start position:0%
them from now and if i buy solar panels
 
03:52:56.550 --> 03:52:56.560 align:start position:0%
from uh bulgaria or some place and they
 
03:52:58.710 --> 03:52:58.720 align:start position:0%
show up uh i don't have to notify the
 
03:53:00.389 --> 03:53:00.399 align:start position:0%
department of energy of that there's no
 
03:53:01.910 --> 03:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
requirement for me to do anything the
 
03:53:03.910 --> 03:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
best i can see other than to install
 
03:53:06.070 --> 03:53:06.080 align:start position:0%
them and so they're going to be there
 
03:53:06.950 --> 03:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
and then
 
03:53:08.950 --> 03:53:08.960 align:start position:0%
20 years from now i've got old solar
 
03:53:10.790 --> 03:53:10.800 align:start position:0%
panels i've got to get rid of some place
 
03:53:12.710 --> 03:53:12.720 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that this i just don't see
 
03:53:14.389 --> 03:53:14.399 align:start position:0%
how this is going to solve there's a
 
03:53:15.750 --> 03:53:15.760 align:start position:0%
real problem i agree but i don't see
 
03:53:18.950 --> 03:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:20.870 --> 03:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
representative thomas
 
03:53:22.389 --> 03:53:22.399 align:start position:0%
thank you miss chair i looked at my
 
03:53:24.630 --> 03:53:24.640 align:start position:0%
notes and during the public hearing i
 
03:53:27.429 --> 03:53:27.439 align:start position:0%
unless i'm incorrect i i didn't see any
 
03:53:29.590 --> 03:53:29.600 align:start position:0%
testimony from the department of energy
 
03:53:30.790 --> 03:53:30.800 align:start position:0%
on this bill
 
03:53:33.349 --> 03:53:33.359 align:start position:0%
but uh perhaps since they're here now
 
03:53:35.269 --> 03:53:35.279 align:start position:0%
would this be a valid
 
03:53:36.710 --> 03:53:36.720 align:start position:0%
question ask them
 
03:53:40.790 --> 03:53:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:42.630 --> 03:53:42.640 align:start position:0%
i doubt they would respond but we could
 
03:53:44.070 --> 03:53:44.080 align:start position:0%
ask i suppose
 
03:53:45.910 --> 03:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
mr roberge do you
 
03:53:47.910 --> 03:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
have any interest in responding to
 
03:53:50.229 --> 03:53:50.239 align:start position:0%
general questions about this legislation
 
03:53:52.150 --> 03:53:52.160 align:start position:0%
even though the department did not
 
03:53:52.160 --> 03:53:54.469 align:start position:0%
even though the department did not
testify

03:53:54.469 --> 03:53:54.479 align:start position:0%
testify
 
03:53:55.750 --> 03:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
at its public
 
03:53:55.760 --> 03:53:59.429 align:start position:0%
at its public
hearing

03:53:59.429 --> 03:53:59.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:01.590 --> 03:54:01.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i think my answer
 
03:54:05.110 --> 03:54:05.120 align:start position:0%
is going to be brief page one line nine
 
03:54:06.469 --> 03:54:06.479 align:start position:0%
department means the department of
 
03:54:09.670 --> 03:54:09.680 align:start position:0%
environmental services so
 
03:54:12.550 --> 03:54:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:14.469 --> 03:54:14.479 align:start position:0%
good answer good answer good answer
 
03:54:15.590 --> 03:54:15.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:54:18.389 --> 03:54:18.399 align:start position:0%
mr chair i was about to point that out
 
03:54:20.710 --> 03:54:20.720 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
03:54:22.870 --> 03:54:22.880 align:start position:0%
uh representative lewicki has a question
 
03:54:25.269 --> 03:54:25.279 align:start position:0%
or a comment thank you mr chairman and
 
03:54:27.910 --> 03:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative um one question
 
03:54:30.070 --> 03:54:30.080 align:start position:0%
i have is that
 
03:54:33.510 --> 03:54:33.520 align:start position:0%
the world of retail is quite uh
 
03:54:33.520 --> 03:54:34.550 align:start position:0%
the world of retail is quite uh
fluid

03:54:34.550 --> 03:54:34.560 align:start position:0%
fluid
 
03:54:36.070 --> 03:54:36.080 align:start position:0%
and what
 
03:54:38.950 --> 03:54:38.960 align:start position:0%
would happen if for instance as happened
 
03:54:41.110 --> 03:54:41.120 align:start position:0%
i think elon musk bought the biggest
 
03:54:43.510 --> 03:54:43.520 align:start position:0%
solar retailer in the country and then
 
03:54:45.910 --> 03:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
essentially collapsed it
 
03:54:48.229 --> 03:54:48.239 align:start position:0%
what happens is the retail landscape
 
03:54:50.550 --> 03:54:50.560 align:start position:0%
changes and retailers that might be in
 
03:54:52.630 --> 03:54:52.640 align:start position:0%
existence one day or one year
 
03:54:55.750 --> 03:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:58.150 --> 03:54:58.160 align:start position:0%
representative platt
 
03:54:59.750 --> 03:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
my response is i would expect the
 
03:55:02.469 --> 03:55:02.479 align:start position:0%
department of environmental services to
 
03:55:04.469 --> 03:55:04.479 align:start position:0%
have some payment plan
 
03:55:06.389 --> 03:55:06.399 align:start position:0%
so that even if they collapse there's
 
03:55:08.950 --> 03:55:08.960 align:start position:0%
money there to recycle them uh as as
 
03:55:10.550 --> 03:55:10.560 align:start position:0%
nuclear has
 
03:55:13.590 --> 03:55:13.600 align:start position:0%
has a a payment plan so that by the time
 
03:55:15.910 --> 03:55:15.920 align:start position:0%
a nuclear plant
 
03:55:17.990 --> 03:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
shuts it down there's plenty of money to
 
03:55:21.110 --> 03:55:21.120 align:start position:0%
to close the plant down and i tell you i
 
03:55:23.510 --> 03:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
did run this by the department of
 
03:55:25.590 --> 03:55:25.600 align:start position:0%
environmental services they took no
 
03:55:27.750 --> 03:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
position on the bill but i heard from
 
03:55:29.189 --> 03:55:29.199 align:start position:0%
the staffer that it was very well
 
03:55:29.199 --> 03:55:32.550 align:start position:0%
the staffer that it was very well
written

03:55:32.550 --> 03:55:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:32.560 --> 03:55:34.870 align:start position:0%
 
representative

mcgee
 
03:55:37.510 --> 03:55:37.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
03:55:39.510 --> 03:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
um i was just looking through the
 
03:55:41.670 --> 03:55:41.680 align:start position:0%
testimony that we received on the bill
 
03:55:44.950 --> 03:55:44.960 align:start position:0%
and while i um i see you know points
 
03:55:47.349 --> 03:55:47.359 align:start position:0%
being made by everybody along the way uh
 
03:55:49.030 --> 03:55:49.040 align:start position:0%
decommissioning a nuclear power plant is
 
03:55:50.950 --> 03:55:50.960 align:start position:0%
a really different thing than somebody
 
03:55:53.510 --> 03:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
who's an individual that owns you know a
 
03:55:55.349 --> 03:55:55.359 align:start position:0%
solar array um
 
03:55:57.990 --> 03:55:58.000 align:start position:0%
and the larger uh installations already
 
03:55:59.429 --> 03:55:59.439 align:start position:0%
have decommissioning plans they're
 
03:56:01.269 --> 03:56:01.279 align:start position:0%
required to
 
03:56:02.950 --> 03:56:02.960 align:start position:0%
and we also had testimony that there
 
03:56:05.269 --> 03:56:05.279 align:start position:0%
really haven't we don't have any issue
 
03:56:05.279 --> 03:56:06.150 align:start position:0%
really haven't we don't have any issue
with

03:56:06.150 --> 03:56:06.160 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:56:07.670 --> 03:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
solar panels
 
03:56:09.590 --> 03:56:09.600 align:start position:0%
ending up in landfills so i'm wondering
 
03:56:12.950 --> 03:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
whether the bill is uh you know a
 
03:56:15.110 --> 03:56:15.120 align:start position:0%
solution in search of a problem i
 
03:56:18.229 --> 03:56:18.239 align:start position:0%
understand that there can be a problem
 
03:56:19.910 --> 03:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
with people
 
03:56:22.150 --> 03:56:22.160 align:start position:0%
disposing of solar panels in a way
 
03:56:24.790 --> 03:56:24.800 align:start position:0%
that's not responsible
 
03:56:26.790 --> 03:56:26.800 align:start position:0%
but when i look at this bill i think
 
03:56:28.790 --> 03:56:28.800 align:start position:0%
it's it's heavy-handed and i think it's
 
03:56:28.800 --> 03:56:29.910 align:start position:0%
it's it's heavy-handed and i think it's
also

03:56:29.910 --> 03:56:29.920 align:start position:0%
also
 
03:56:31.910 --> 03:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
targeting really just one industry we
 
03:56:34.229 --> 03:56:34.239 align:start position:0%
don't require this for any other
 
03:56:36.070 --> 03:56:36.080 align:start position:0%
uh any other industries of these type
 
03:56:38.070 --> 03:56:38.080 align:start position:0%
oil furnaces gas furnaces heat pumps we
 
03:56:40.389 --> 03:56:40.399 align:start position:0%
don't have decommissioning plans for
 
03:56:43.750 --> 03:56:43.760 align:start position:0%
individual power generation in general
 
03:56:43.760 --> 03:56:45.269 align:start position:0%
individual power generation in general
and

03:56:45.269 --> 03:56:45.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:56:46.790 --> 03:56:46.800 align:start position:0%
and i think it kind of sends the wrong
 
03:56:48.630 --> 03:56:48.640 align:start position:0%
message as well because
 
03:56:51.269 --> 03:56:51.279 align:start position:0%
it adds an additional cost and an
 
03:56:53.030 --> 03:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
additional complexity to people
 
03:56:54.870 --> 03:56:54.880 align:start position:0%
participating in the market here in new
 
03:56:56.229 --> 03:56:56.239 align:start position:0%
hampshire which i think is the opposite
 
03:56:57.830 --> 03:56:57.840 align:start position:0%
effect that we're trying to have which
 
03:56:59.910 --> 03:56:59.920 align:start position:0%
is to have competition and allow the
 
03:57:01.910 --> 03:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
markets to help us decide
 
03:57:04.870 --> 03:57:04.880 align:start position:0%
um i think the bill is premature in that
 
03:57:06.870 --> 03:57:06.880 align:start position:0%
it's trying to solve for something that
 
03:57:08.550 --> 03:57:08.560 align:start position:0%
is really not an issue in new hampshire
 
03:57:10.710 --> 03:57:10.720 align:start position:0%
and i would understand the argument
 
03:57:12.070 --> 03:57:12.080 align:start position:0%
saying well we don't want it to become
 
03:57:14.710 --> 03:57:14.720 align:start position:0%
an issue but i would also submit to you
 
03:57:14.720 --> 03:57:15.830 align:start position:0%
an issue but i would also submit to you
that

03:57:15.830 --> 03:57:15.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:57:17.910 --> 03:57:17.920 align:start position:0%
people who tend to
 
03:57:20.630 --> 03:57:20.640 align:start position:0%
invest in solar either on their roofs or
 
03:57:22.790 --> 03:57:22.800 align:start position:0%
as solar arrays to help augment their
 
03:57:24.469 --> 03:57:24.479 align:start position:0%
electric costs are generally people who
 
03:57:26.229 --> 03:57:26.239 align:start position:0%
are already very conscientious of the
 
03:57:26.239 --> 03:57:27.349 align:start position:0%
are already very conscientious of the
environment

03:57:27.349 --> 03:57:27.359 align:start position:0%
environment
 
03:57:29.750 --> 03:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
and so the idea of them
 
03:57:31.510 --> 03:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
tossing something off into a landfill is
 
03:57:35.189 --> 03:57:35.199 align:start position:0%
probably inconsistent as well
 
03:57:37.110 --> 03:57:37.120 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
03:57:41.110 --> 03:57:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:43.269 --> 03:57:43.279 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
03:57:45.030 --> 03:57:45.040 align:start position:0%
we we have another bill which is
 
03:57:46.630 --> 03:57:46.640 align:start position:0%
currently in a different committee hb
 
03:57:46.640 --> 03:57:49.110 align:start position:0%
currently in a different committee hb
hb111

03:57:49.110 --> 03:57:49.120 align:start position:0%
hb111
 
03:57:50.630 --> 03:57:50.640 align:start position:0%
or 1111
 
03:57:52.870 --> 03:57:52.880 align:start position:0%
which is to establish a commission to
 
03:57:55.590 --> 03:57:55.600 align:start position:0%
look at extended producer responsibility
 
03:57:58.070 --> 03:57:58.080 align:start position:0%
and i think i think we have a solution
 
03:58:00.870 --> 03:58:00.880 align:start position:0%
in in the making here which would render
 
03:58:03.670 --> 03:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
um the necessity for for this
 
03:58:03.680 --> 03:58:04.790 align:start position:0%
um the necessity for for this
moot

03:58:04.790 --> 03:58:04.800 align:start position:0%
moot
 
03:58:08.309 --> 03:58:08.319 align:start position:0%
with extended producer responsibility
 
03:58:10.309 --> 03:58:10.319 align:start position:0%
by keeping the
 
03:58:12.150 --> 03:58:12.160 align:start position:0%
emphasis on the producer and not the
 
03:58:15.670 --> 03:58:15.680 align:start position:0%
retailer it encourages a redesign
 
03:58:18.309 --> 03:58:18.319 align:start position:0%
such that when you're producing the
 
03:58:21.030 --> 03:58:21.040 align:start position:0%
product you're looking at the best way
 
03:58:23.830 --> 03:58:23.840 align:start position:0%
to recycle all of the elements
 
03:58:26.150 --> 03:58:26.160 align:start position:0%
and and that is really the way that
 
03:58:28.229 --> 03:58:28.239 align:start position:0%
we're going to reduce our our waste
 
03:58:30.710 --> 03:58:30.720 align:start position:0%
stream which is in danger of
 
03:58:33.269 --> 03:58:33.279 align:start position:0%
overwhelming many municipalities and
 
03:58:33.279 --> 03:58:34.469 align:start position:0%
overwhelming many municipalities and
costing

03:58:34.469 --> 03:58:34.479 align:start position:0%
costing
 
03:58:35.830 --> 03:58:35.840 align:start position:0%
many of our
 
03:58:35.840 --> 03:58:37.349 align:start position:0%
many of our
towns

03:58:37.349 --> 03:58:37.359 align:start position:0%
towns
 
03:58:40.469 --> 03:58:40.479 align:start position:0%
putting a real stress on their budgets
 
03:58:43.189 --> 03:58:43.199 align:start position:0%
so i i would suggest that we
 
03:58:45.189 --> 03:58:45.199 align:start position:0%
not support this bill
 
03:58:46.950 --> 03:58:46.960 align:start position:0%
but that we look to
 
03:58:50.870 --> 03:58:50.880 align:start position:0%
hb 1111 and that commission to supply us
 
03:58:52.790 --> 03:58:52.800 align:start position:0%
with a broad
 
03:58:54.229 --> 03:58:54.239 align:start position:0%
a broad
 
03:58:58.070 --> 03:58:58.080 align:start position:0%
sec broad spectrum solution to a major
 
03:59:00.150 --> 03:59:00.160 align:start position:0%
problem that we are facing we we
 
03:59:02.389 --> 03:59:02.399 align:start position:0%
certainly on on this side of the aisle
 
03:59:04.469 --> 03:59:04.479 align:start position:0%
support your effort to to look at
 
03:59:06.550 --> 03:59:06.560 align:start position:0%
recycling to look at the reclamation of
 
03:59:08.870 --> 03:59:08.880 align:start position:0%
materials but i i don't think this
 
03:59:11.910 --> 03:59:11.920 align:start position:0%
particular bill is the best way to do it
 
03:59:13.590 --> 03:59:13.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative mann is
 
03:59:13.600 --> 03:59:14.950 align:start position:0%
thank you representative mann is
recognized

03:59:14.950 --> 03:59:14.960 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
03:59:17.510 --> 03:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
yes i'm i'm just curious what the what
 
03:59:19.030 --> 03:59:19.040 align:start position:0%
is the problem are the is there a
 
03:59:20.790 --> 03:59:20.800 align:start position:0%
toxicity to the
 
03:59:23.750 --> 03:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
spent solar panels
 
03:59:26.870 --> 03:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
yes very much so yes
 
03:59:29.030 --> 03:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
and we don't want municipal
 
03:59:29.040 --> 03:59:30.550 align:start position:0%
and we don't want municipal
uh

03:59:30.550 --> 03:59:30.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:59:33.349 --> 03:59:33.359 align:start position:0%
waste disposal
 
03:59:35.510 --> 03:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
sites to end up having to deal with that
 
03:59:38.630 --> 03:59:38.640 align:start position:0%
toxicity well because small towns just
 
03:59:40.870 --> 03:59:40.880 align:start position:0%
simply can't afford it right but i'm
 
03:59:42.790 --> 03:59:42.800 align:start position:0%
just trying to figure out the toxicity
 
03:59:45.189 --> 03:59:45.199 align:start position:0%
issue what what is it about the panels
 
03:59:47.269 --> 03:59:47.279 align:start position:0%
that makes them difficult to reach just
 
03:59:50.309 --> 03:59:50.319 align:start position:0%
simply leave on the ground
 
03:59:52.150 --> 03:59:52.160 align:start position:0%

04:00:21.189 --> 04:00:21.199 align:start position:0%
and representative thomas is recognized
 
04:00:23.030 --> 04:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
thank you miss chair uh
 
04:00:24.070 --> 04:00:24.080 align:start position:0%
going back to a previous
 
04:00:25.830 --> 04:00:25.840 align:start position:0%
representative's comments
 
04:00:28.229 --> 04:00:28.239 align:start position:0%
as a lot of we have a lot of experience
 
04:00:28.239 --> 04:00:29.429 align:start position:0%
as a lot of we have a lot of experience
of

04:00:29.429 --> 04:00:29.439 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:00:31.349 --> 04:00:31.359 align:start position:0%
not knowing which bills are going to
 
04:00:33.030 --> 04:00:33.040 align:start position:0%
pass and not pass in the house and
 
04:00:34.550 --> 04:00:34.560 align:start position:0%
certainly not which ones may make it
 
04:00:36.870 --> 04:00:36.880 align:start position:0%
through the senate so
 
04:00:39.750 --> 04:00:39.760 align:start position:0%
i recommend that we pass this bill and
 
04:00:39.760 --> 04:00:40.990 align:start position:0%
i recommend that we pass this bill and
if

04:00:40.990 --> 04:00:41.000 align:start position:0%
if
 
04:00:43.990 --> 04:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
hb111 passes as well these types of
 
04:00:45.830 --> 04:00:45.840 align:start position:0%
bills can be worked out either in the
 
04:00:48.070 --> 04:00:48.080 align:start position:0%
senate or committee of conference
 
04:00:49.349 --> 04:00:49.359 align:start position:0%
or or
 
04:00:51.590 --> 04:00:51.600 align:start position:0%
wherever or the time of the house votes
 
04:00:53.830 --> 04:00:53.840 align:start position:0%
we can decide which one at the time but
 
04:00:53.840 --> 04:00:54.790 align:start position:0%
we can decide which one at the time but
without

04:00:54.790 --> 04:00:54.800 align:start position:0%
without
 
04:00:57.349 --> 04:00:57.359 align:start position:0%
we can we cannot rely on one bill that
 
04:00:59.830 --> 04:00:59.840 align:start position:0%
might pass in some other committee so i
 
04:01:04.389 --> 04:01:04.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:06.950 --> 04:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
representative pementel
 
04:01:09.910 --> 04:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh an issue that's
 
04:01:10.870 --> 04:01:10.880 align:start position:0%
going to
 
04:01:13.750 --> 04:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
uh be a problem in 20 years i think we
 
04:01:15.830 --> 04:01:15.840 align:start position:0%
could wait a year
 
04:01:18.950 --> 04:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
to pat to try and pass a different bill
 
04:01:20.389 --> 04:01:20.399 align:start position:0%
uh number one
 
04:01:23.189 --> 04:01:23.199 align:start position:0%
number two um
 
04:01:24.950 --> 04:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
uh here here on
 
04:01:27.110 --> 04:01:27.120 align:start position:0%
hp 11 11.
 
04:01:27.120 --> 04:01:28.950 align:start position:0%
hp 11 11.
uh

04:01:28.950 --> 04:01:28.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:01:28.960 --> 04:01:29.910 align:start position:0%
uh
the

04:01:29.910 --> 04:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:01:31.429 --> 04:01:31.439 align:start position:0%
when i
 
04:01:33.429 --> 04:01:33.439 align:start position:0%
have my refrigerator that i need to
 
04:01:33.439 --> 04:01:34.229 align:start position:0%
have my refrigerator that i need to
bring

04:01:34.229 --> 04:01:34.239 align:start position:0%
bring
 
04:01:35.269 --> 04:01:35.279 align:start position:0%
to the
 
04:01:35.279 --> 04:01:36.389 align:start position:0%
to the
uh

04:01:36.389 --> 04:01:36.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:01:37.670 --> 04:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
the local
 
04:01:39.349 --> 04:01:39.359 align:start position:0%
recycling center
 
04:01:41.670 --> 04:01:41.680 align:start position:0%
i have to pay a fee so that they can
 
04:01:42.950 --> 04:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
remove the
 
04:01:42.960 --> 04:01:45.030 align:start position:0%
remove the
um

04:01:45.030 --> 04:01:45.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:01:47.750 --> 04:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
the the the freon or whatever
 
04:01:50.309 --> 04:01:50.319 align:start position:0%
whatever the refrigerant is in it
 
04:01:52.630 --> 04:01:52.640 align:start position:0%
and uh so there is
 
04:01:55.429 --> 04:01:55.439 align:start position:0%
a fee that i pay at the end of the life
 
04:01:57.750 --> 04:01:57.760 align:start position:0%
of that appliance
 
04:01:57.760 --> 04:01:58.710 align:start position:0%
of that appliance
um

04:01:58.710 --> 04:01:58.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:02:02.150 --> 04:02:02.160 align:start position:0%
i anticipate the same thing will happen
 
04:02:04.469 --> 04:02:04.479 align:start position:0%
with our solar panels
 
04:02:07.110 --> 04:02:07.120 align:start position:0%
um i would think that anyone who is
 
04:02:09.429 --> 04:02:09.439 align:start position:0%
putting solar panels on their roof know
 
04:02:11.429 --> 04:02:11.439 align:start position:0%
that at some point they're going to have
 
04:02:13.030 --> 04:02:13.040 align:start position:0%
to be replaced
 
04:02:15.590 --> 04:02:15.600 align:start position:0%
and they
 
04:02:17.110 --> 04:02:17.120 align:start position:0%
i would think they would know there's
 
04:02:19.990 --> 04:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
going to be a cost to that
 
04:02:21.189 --> 04:02:21.199 align:start position:0%
the the
 
04:02:24.710 --> 04:02:24.720 align:start position:0%
right now in europe
 
04:02:26.870 --> 04:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
they are
 
04:02:29.110 --> 04:02:29.120 align:start position:0%
they have
 
04:02:29.120 --> 04:02:30.950 align:start position:0%
they have
large

04:02:30.950 --> 04:02:30.960 align:start position:0%
large
 
04:02:33.510 --> 04:02:33.520 align:start position:0%
recycling operations
 
04:02:37.910 --> 04:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:37.920 --> 04:02:38.790 align:start position:0%
 
can

04:02:38.790 --> 04:02:38.800 align:start position:0%
can
 
04:02:41.910 --> 04:02:41.920 align:start position:0%
take care of 50 of all the solar panels
 
04:02:41.920 --> 04:02:42.790 align:start position:0%
take care of 50 of all the solar panels
in

04:02:42.790 --> 04:02:42.800 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:02:44.950 --> 04:02:44.960 align:start position:0%
the european union
 
04:02:47.510 --> 04:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
and recycle 95
 
04:02:49.910 --> 04:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
plus percent of the
 
04:02:51.830 --> 04:02:51.840 align:start position:0%
heavy metals in those
 
04:02:54.550 --> 04:02:54.560 align:start position:0%
solar panels
 
04:02:54.560 --> 04:02:55.510 align:start position:0%
solar panels
that's

04:02:55.510 --> 04:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
that's
 
04:02:58.229 --> 04:02:58.239 align:start position:0%
a plant for the entire
 
04:02:58.239 --> 04:03:00.469 align:start position:0%
a plant for the entire
eu

04:03:00.469 --> 04:03:00.479 align:start position:0%
eu
 
04:03:03.670 --> 04:03:03.680 align:start position:0%
i can't imagine that we would be able to
 
04:03:06.070 --> 04:03:06.080 align:start position:0%
have the economy of scale here in new
 
04:03:06.080 --> 04:03:07.269 align:start position:0%
have the economy of scale here in new
hampshire

04:03:07.269 --> 04:03:07.279 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
04:03:07.279 --> 04:03:08.309 align:start position:0%
hampshire
to

04:03:08.309 --> 04:03:08.319 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:03:10.550 --> 04:03:10.560 align:start position:0%
do that kind of recycling
 
04:03:10.560 --> 04:03:11.510 align:start position:0%
do that kind of recycling
so

04:03:11.510 --> 04:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:03:13.830 --> 04:03:13.840 align:start position:0%
this really is going to be
 
04:03:17.349 --> 04:03:17.359 align:start position:0%
a national issue not a local issue
 
04:03:20.229 --> 04:03:20.239 align:start position:0%
as far as how this gets done so i think
 
04:03:22.950 --> 04:03:22.960 align:start position:0%
that we're this is probably premature
 
04:03:27.670 --> 04:03:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:30.309 --> 04:03:30.319 align:start position:0%
wish to make sure that these heavy
 
04:03:34.389 --> 04:03:34.399 align:start position:0%
metals don't get into the waste stream
 
04:03:39.110 --> 04:03:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:40.870 --> 04:03:40.880 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
04:03:43.510 --> 04:03:43.520 align:start position:0%
we need to look at or i'm going to look
 
04:03:45.910 --> 04:03:45.920 align:start position:0%
at what my goal is right now
 
04:03:49.030 --> 04:03:49.040 align:start position:0%
and i think one of our goals or my goal
 
04:03:51.510 --> 04:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
would be to encourage people to
 
04:03:53.110 --> 04:03:53.120 align:start position:0%
go to solar
 
04:03:56.790 --> 04:03:56.800 align:start position:0%
not discourage and i think at this point
 
04:03:58.150 --> 04:03:58.160 align:start position:0%
in time
 
04:04:01.110 --> 04:04:01.120 align:start position:0%
and timing is everything this bill
 
04:04:03.429 --> 04:04:03.439 align:start position:0%
would discourage because the costs of
 
04:04:05.670 --> 04:04:05.680 align:start position:0%
all this if they're born by the reit
 
04:04:08.790 --> 04:04:08.800 align:start position:0%
retailer i'm going to be cos passed on
 
04:04:11.349 --> 04:04:11.359 align:start position:0%
to the customer and the customer at
 
04:04:12.870 --> 04:04:12.880 align:start position:0%
right now
 
04:04:14.870 --> 04:04:14.880 align:start position:0%
in this environment
 
04:04:14.880 --> 04:04:16.229 align:start position:0%
in this environment
can't

04:04:16.229 --> 04:04:16.239 align:start position:0%
can't
 
04:04:18.229 --> 04:04:18.239 align:start position:0%
bear another quarter
 
04:04:20.550 --> 04:04:20.560 align:start position:0%
we also know that we have problems with
 
04:04:20.560 --> 04:04:22.389 align:start position:0%
we also know that we have problems with
recycling

04:04:22.389 --> 04:04:22.399 align:start position:0%
recycling
 
04:04:24.309 --> 04:04:24.319 align:start position:0%
with recycling your computer with
 
04:04:26.309 --> 04:04:26.319 align:start position:0%
recycling everything because those
 
04:04:28.630 --> 04:04:28.640 align:start position:0%
things used to be taken care of and the
 
04:04:30.550 --> 04:04:30.560 align:start position:0%
way they were taken care of stopped for
 
04:04:32.550 --> 04:04:32.560 align:start position:0%
a while so that
 
04:04:34.150 --> 04:04:34.160 align:start position:0%
i don't know what happens to it when i
 
04:04:35.990 --> 04:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
bring it to i call it the dump the
 
04:04:37.990 --> 04:04:38.000 align:start position:0%
transfer station i don't know what they
 
04:04:40.070 --> 04:04:40.080 align:start position:0%
do with it i give them money and and
 
04:04:42.870 --> 04:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
there it goes but i don't know
 
04:04:45.670 --> 04:04:45.680 align:start position:0%
if there is anybody pulling the lithium
 
04:04:49.030 --> 04:04:49.040 align:start position:0%
out pulling i don't know that
 
04:04:51.750 --> 04:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
and with proliferation of all not just
 
04:04:53.110 --> 04:04:53.120 align:start position:0%
solar panels
 
04:04:55.110 --> 04:04:55.120 align:start position:0%
houses don't have have two three
 
04:04:57.910 --> 04:04:57.920 align:start position:0%
computers two three televisions
 
04:05:02.710 --> 04:05:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:05.269 --> 04:05:05.279 align:start position:0%
including the plastic the bottle i have
 
04:05:06.630 --> 04:05:06.640 align:start position:0%
right here
 
04:05:06.640 --> 04:05:07.590 align:start position:0%
right here
what

04:05:07.590 --> 04:05:07.600 align:start position:0%
what
 
04:05:09.590 --> 04:05:09.600 align:start position:0%
we have to figure out first what we're
 
04:05:11.830 --> 04:05:11.840 align:start position:0%
going to do with it and then we have to
 
04:05:14.389 --> 04:05:14.399 align:start position:0%
discard we have to encourage
 
04:05:17.670 --> 04:05:17.680 align:start position:0%
more use to save on the other end
 
04:05:19.670 --> 04:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
and i don't think we've gotten there yet
 
04:05:21.830 --> 04:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
and i think this bill
 
04:05:23.990 --> 04:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
needs more discussion
 
04:05:24.000 --> 04:05:24.790 align:start position:0%
needs more discussion
and

04:05:24.790 --> 04:05:24.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:05:26.309 --> 04:05:26.319 align:start position:0%
we need to put our collective heads
 
04:05:28.550 --> 04:05:28.560 align:start position:0%
together and come out with a plan
 
04:05:30.950 --> 04:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
i think that's vitally important we
 
04:05:32.630 --> 04:05:32.640 align:start position:0%
talked about uh
 
04:05:34.150 --> 04:05:34.160 align:start position:0%
nuclear waste we don't know what to do
 
04:05:35.910 --> 04:05:35.920 align:start position:0%
with that yet either they haven't
 
04:05:37.429 --> 04:05:37.439 align:start position:0%
figured out what to do with me yet
 
04:05:40.389 --> 04:05:40.399 align:start position:0%
either so i think that
 
04:05:41.990 --> 04:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
i mean we've had all kinds of hair but
 
04:05:43.590 --> 04:05:43.600 align:start position:0%
you laugh but we've had all that kind of
 
04:05:46.790 --> 04:05:46.800 align:start position:0%
hair chemically do this do that
 
04:05:51.110 --> 04:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
nobody knows so we have to uh
 
04:05:53.349 --> 04:05:53.359 align:start position:0%
we have to appreciate the work
 
04:05:56.229 --> 04:05:56.239 align:start position:0%
we have to appreciate the idea but the
 
04:05:59.590 --> 04:05:59.600 align:start position:0%
timing is wrong
 
04:06:01.510 --> 04:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
representative wiki
 
04:06:04.070 --> 04:06:04.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
04:06:04.080 --> 04:06:05.830 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
i

04:06:05.830 --> 04:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:06:07.670 --> 04:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
it may be that a different approach
 
04:06:10.630 --> 04:06:10.640 align:start position:0%
would work better i'm responsible for a
 
04:06:13.429 --> 04:06:13.439 align:start position:0%
very old house down in another state and
 
04:06:15.269 --> 04:06:15.279 align:start position:0%
i got a thing in the electric bill that
 
04:06:17.590 --> 04:06:17.600 align:start position:0%
said we'll pay you 75
 
04:06:20.469 --> 04:06:20.479 align:start position:0%
for a refrigerator i had a
 
04:06:22.550 --> 04:06:22.560 align:start position:0%
70 year old refrigerator literally that
 
04:06:25.030 --> 04:06:25.040 align:start position:0%
i had to get rid of and i got 75 dollars
 
04:06:26.790 --> 04:06:26.800 align:start position:0%
for it and
 
04:06:28.469 --> 04:06:28.479 align:start position:0%
given that
 
04:06:31.189 --> 04:06:31.199 align:start position:0%
these solar panels are to a great extent
 
04:06:33.110 --> 04:06:33.120 align:start position:0%
going to be connected to the grid the
 
04:06:34.870 --> 04:06:34.880 align:start position:0%
electric companies should know who has
 
04:06:37.110 --> 04:06:37.120 align:start position:0%
them if they cease producing electricity
 
04:06:38.950 --> 04:06:38.960 align:start position:0%
or if something changes they should know
 
04:06:40.309 --> 04:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
and it may be that that would be a
 
04:06:54.469 --> 04:06:54.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:57.590 --> 04:06:57.600 align:start position:0%
okay representative partial
 
04:07:01.110 --> 04:07:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:03.670 --> 04:07:03.680 align:start position:0%
i think that i applaud the idea of
 
04:07:06.630 --> 04:07:06.640 align:start position:0%
making our producers of these products
 
04:07:08.710 --> 04:07:08.720 align:start position:0%
more responsible
 
04:07:10.870 --> 04:07:10.880 align:start position:0%
i'm afraid that it was put
 
04:07:13.750 --> 04:07:13.760 align:start position:0%
undue burden upon my local solar
 
04:07:16.150 --> 04:07:16.160 align:start position:0%
retailer and calls me to maybe seek
 
04:07:17.510 --> 04:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
another solution
 
04:07:19.030 --> 04:07:19.040 align:start position:0%
elsewhere which does not benefit my
 
04:07:20.469 --> 04:07:20.479 align:start position:0%
local community
 
04:07:23.110 --> 04:07:23.120 align:start position:0%
that's part of my concern and the others
 
04:07:25.910 --> 04:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
by signaling out the solar industry
 
04:07:27.910 --> 04:07:27.920 align:start position:0%
um i mean we have
 
04:07:29.990 --> 04:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
we have tires that are jamming my
 
04:07:31.750 --> 04:07:31.760 align:start position:0%
landfill not solar panels we have
 
04:07:33.590 --> 04:07:33.600 align:start position:0%
plastic bottles that are jamming my
 
04:07:36.710 --> 04:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
landfill and these are being produced
 
04:07:39.429 --> 04:07:39.439 align:start position:0%
uh with no regard of how
 
04:07:41.349 --> 04:07:41.359 align:start position:0%
they're going to be disposed of i think
 
04:07:43.349 --> 04:07:43.359 align:start position:0%
a more comprehensive solution might i
 
04:07:44.950 --> 04:07:44.960 align:start position:0%
would applaud that and i would hope that
 
04:07:47.030 --> 04:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
we could maybe seek that together
 
04:07:49.349 --> 04:07:49.359 align:start position:0%
a solution that addresses not just solar
 
04:07:51.750 --> 04:07:51.760 align:start position:0%
panels but everything that we produce
 
04:07:52.790 --> 04:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
right now
 
04:07:54.469 --> 04:07:54.479 align:start position:0%

04:07:56.149 --> 04:07:56.159 align:start position:0%
burdensome way for our municipalities to
 
04:07:57.590 --> 04:07:57.600 align:start position:0%
dispose of them
 
04:07:59.269 --> 04:07:59.279 align:start position:0%

04:33:05.990 --> 04:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
we have a conflict well let me tell you
 
04:33:08.310 --> 04:33:08.320 align:start position:0%
let me let me suggest this
 
04:33:10.310 --> 04:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
i have to consult with
 
04:33:13.029 --> 04:33:13.039 align:start position:0%
the other committee that occupies this
 
04:33:15.429 --> 04:33:15.439 align:start position:0%
room on the days when we don't to find
 
04:33:17.830 --> 04:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
out if march 9th is available if it is
 
04:33:20.470 --> 04:33:20.480 align:start position:0%
we'll do it march 9th if it's not

we'll do it on march 7th
 
04:33:24.470 --> 04:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
04:33:27.429 --> 04:33:27.439 align:start position:0%
reserve both march 7th and march 9th at
 
04:33:28.551 --> 04:33:28.561 align:start position:0%

04:33:46.869 --> 04:33:46.879 align:start position:0%
they are okay so it looks like we'll
 
04:33:48.310 --> 04:33:48.320 align:start position:0%
probably have to have it on the seventh
 
04:33:48.320 --> 04:33:53.670 align:start position:0%
probably have to have it on the seventh
then

04:33:53.670 --> 04:33:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:55.029 --> 04:33:55.039 align:start position:0%

because we have a bunch of issues to
resolve

04:33:56.789 --> 04:33:56.799 align:start position:0%
resolve
 
04:33:56.799 --> 04:33:58.869 align:start position:0%
resolve
so

04:33:58.869 --> 04:33:58.879 align:start position:0%

04:34:01.670 --> 04:34:01.680 align:start position:0%
we have to consult with des and
 
04:34:04.310 --> 04:34:04.320 align:start position:0%

04:34:17.189 --> 04:34:17.199 align:start position:0%
and i'll make sure that gets into the
 
04:34:22.230 --> 04:34:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:22.240 --> 04:34:26.629 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:34:26.629 --> 04:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:27.830 --> 04:34:27.840 align:start position:0%

eight eight eight zero h
 
04:38:05.590 --> 04:38:05.600 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion
 
04:38:07.910 --> 04:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts
 
04:38:09.590 --> 04:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
i'll be brief because i want to go home
 
04:38:11.429 --> 04:38:11.439 align:start position:0%
just like everybody else
 
04:38:11.439 --> 04:38:12.390 align:start position:0%
just like everybody else
i

04:38:12.390 --> 04:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:38:14.709 --> 04:38:14.719 align:start position:0%
i probably am the one of the only ones
 
04:38:16.789 --> 04:38:16.799 align:start position:0%
on this committee who served on the
 
04:38:19.189 --> 04:38:19.199 align:start position:0%
electric oversight committee and when it
 
04:38:19.199 --> 04:38:20.310 align:start position:0%
electric oversight committee and when it
was

04:38:20.310 --> 04:38:20.320 align:start position:0%
was
 
04:38:21.910 --> 04:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
04:38:21.920 --> 04:38:25.510 align:start position:0%
the uh
redistrict

04:38:25.510 --> 04:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:27.349 --> 04:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
my mind is brilliant restructuring
 
04:38:29.590 --> 04:38:29.600 align:start position:0%
restructuring committee and i've been on
 
04:38:31.029 --> 04:38:31.039 align:start position:0%
it ever since
 
04:38:33.590 --> 04:38:33.600 align:start position:0%
and in the last two years and i was not
 
04:38:36.551 --> 04:38:36.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:38.070 --> 04:38:38.080 align:start position:0%
one of the things that the committee
 
04:38:41.189 --> 04:38:41.199 align:start position:0%
does that's very important i believe
 
04:38:44.789 --> 04:38:44.799 align:start position:0%
is when these reports come out
 
04:38:47.189 --> 04:38:47.199 align:start position:0%
we request the people you make a report
 
04:38:51.109 --> 04:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:52.470 --> 04:38:52.480 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
04:38:54.390 --> 04:38:54.400 align:start position:0%
hears those reports
 
04:38:56.470 --> 04:38:56.480 align:start position:0%
here's the presentations
 
04:38:58.709 --> 04:38:58.719 align:start position:0%
discusses those presentations and go
 
04:39:00.470 --> 04:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
over them
 
04:39:02.470 --> 04:39:02.480 align:start position:0%
if you look at one of the charges it's
 
04:39:04.709 --> 04:39:04.719 align:start position:0%
to of the committee would be to look at
 
04:39:07.670 --> 04:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
the changing climate or the changing
 
04:39:09.670 --> 04:39:09.680 align:start position:0%
atmosphere what electricity is going to
 
04:39:09.680 --> 04:39:10.551 align:start position:0%
atmosphere what electricity is going to
be

04:39:10.551 --> 04:39:10.561 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:39:13.189 --> 04:39:13.199 align:start position:0%
and i think that's very important and to
 
04:39:16.551 --> 04:39:16.561 align:start position:0%
guide us along the way
 
04:39:16.561 --> 04:39:18.629 align:start position:0%
guide us along the way
covid

04:39:18.629 --> 04:39:18.639 align:start position:0%
covid
 
04:39:21.670 --> 04:39:21.680 align:start position:0%
dropped in on us unfortunately
 
04:39:23.990 --> 04:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
and we really haven't had a chance for
 
04:39:26.709 --> 04:39:26.719 align:start position:0%
these committees to do what they have to
 
04:39:29.189 --> 04:39:29.199 align:start position:0%
and then report back to us which is what
 
04:39:30.869 --> 04:39:30.879 align:start position:0%
the committee does
 
04:39:33.349 --> 04:39:33.359 align:start position:0%
most times when these reports come out
 
04:39:34.949 --> 04:39:34.959 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to say they get circular
 
04:39:38.310 --> 04:39:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:39.750 --> 04:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
they go to the committee they don't go
 
04:39:41.190 --> 04:39:41.200 align:start position:0%
to everybody in the committee they're
 
04:39:43.990 --> 04:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
posted online and
 
04:39:45.990 --> 04:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
usually you don't get them the committee
 
04:39:48.230 --> 04:39:48.240 align:start position:0%
has a chance these these smaller
 
04:39:50.708 --> 04:39:50.718 align:start position:0%
committees have a chance to
 
04:39:52.708 --> 04:39:52.718 align:start position:0%
go into depth and to probe the
 
04:39:52.718 --> 04:39:54.310 align:start position:0%
go into depth and to probe the
information

04:39:54.310 --> 04:39:54.320 align:start position:0%
information
 
04:39:56.628 --> 04:39:56.638 align:start position:0%
we usually don't have that kind of time
 
04:39:59.350 --> 04:39:59.360 align:start position:0%
or we haven't had it in the past couple
 
04:40:00.390 --> 04:40:00.400 align:start position:0%
of years
 
04:40:03.270 --> 04:40:03.280 align:start position:0%
and i understand covet intervened but we
 
04:40:05.110 --> 04:40:05.120 align:start position:0%
won't do it
 
04:40:07.670 --> 04:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
so i think that getting rid of these
 
04:40:07.680 --> 04:40:09.510 align:start position:0%
so i think that getting rid of these
committees

04:40:09.510 --> 04:40:09.520 align:start position:0%
committees
 
04:40:10.948 --> 04:40:10.958 align:start position:0%
is very
 
04:40:12.788 --> 04:40:12.798 align:start position:0%
very important
 
04:40:15.350 --> 04:40:15.360 align:start position:0%
we're having a major overhaul in our
 
04:40:18.628 --> 04:40:18.638 align:start position:0%
electricity delivery delivery system
 
04:40:22.310 --> 04:40:22.320 align:start position:0%
just like we did with restructuring
 
04:40:24.470 --> 04:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
things are changing
 
04:40:27.830 --> 04:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:31.590 --> 04:40:31.600 align:start position:0%
superficial or rushed discussion
 
04:40:34.230 --> 04:40:34.240 align:start position:0%
you need in-depth probing
 
04:40:35.590 --> 04:40:35.600 align:start position:0%
and planning
 
04:40:37.670 --> 04:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
and a commission can do that and make
 
04:40:39.910 --> 04:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
the proper recommendations
 
04:40:42.788 --> 04:40:42.798 align:start position:0%
to this committee we're not all
 
04:40:45.510 --> 04:40:45.520 align:start position:0%
experts i'm not an expert i i don't know
 
04:40:47.350 --> 04:40:47.360 align:start position:0%
there's several on this committee that
 
04:40:49.350 --> 04:40:49.360 align:start position:0%
are experts
 
04:40:51.350 --> 04:40:51.360 align:start position:0%
but i need somebody to explain it and
 
04:40:53.590 --> 04:40:53.600 align:start position:0%
explain it in depth
 
04:40:54.550 --> 04:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
what is
 
04:40:56.310 --> 04:40:56.320 align:start position:0%
this says this but what does it really
 
04:40:56.320 --> 04:40:57.510 align:start position:0%
this says this but what does it really
mean

04:40:57.510 --> 04:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
mean
 
04:40:59.510 --> 04:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
and i think that to take this committee
 
04:41:03.590 --> 04:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
away at this juncture we're on the brink
 
04:41:07.510 --> 04:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
of changing our form of energy
 
04:41:09.830 --> 04:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
i think it's a mistake because i don't
 
04:41:12.390 --> 04:41:12.400 align:start position:0%
think this committee can handle it i
 
04:41:14.708 --> 04:41:14.718 align:start position:0%
don't think des by themselves can handle
 
04:41:14.718 --> 04:41:16.390 align:start position:0%
don't think des by themselves can handle
it

04:41:16.390 --> 04:41:16.400 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:41:19.270 --> 04:41:19.280 align:start position:0%
there was a time when des was forbidden
 
04:41:21.910 --> 04:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
to talk about certain subjects
 
04:41:24.310 --> 04:41:24.320 align:start position:0%
you can't tell a committee you can't
 
04:41:26.708 --> 04:41:26.718 align:start position:0%
talk about this committee can talk about
 
04:41:29.110 --> 04:41:29.120 align:start position:0%
whatever they really want to what's in
 
04:41:29.120 --> 04:41:29.990 align:start position:0%
whatever they really want to what's in
their

04:41:29.990 --> 04:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
their
 
04:41:32.150 --> 04:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
what's in their purview and anything
 
04:41:34.070 --> 04:41:34.080 align:start position:0%
else that's pertinent
 
04:41:36.628 --> 04:41:36.638 align:start position:0%
so i think that we
 
04:41:39.110 --> 04:41:39.120 align:start position:0%
really are doing a disservice we may
 
04:41:41.510 --> 04:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
have a lot of committees that
 
04:41:43.430 --> 04:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
are not important or don't meet i won't
 
04:41:44.788 --> 04:41:44.798 align:start position:0%
say they're not important every
 
04:41:47.030 --> 04:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
committee is important but i think that
 
04:41:48.788 --> 04:41:48.798 align:start position:0%
this is a committee that can really do
 
04:41:50.628 --> 04:41:50.638 align:start position:0%
the in-depth service
 
04:41:54.150 --> 04:41:54.160 align:start position:0%
when it gets up and running again
 
04:41:54.160 --> 04:41:55.350 align:start position:0%
when it gets up and running again
and

04:41:55.350 --> 04:41:55.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:41:59.430 --> 04:41:59.440 align:start position:0%
i just think that we need to have that
 
04:42:01.910 --> 04:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
that's all and i'm probably again one of
 
04:42:03.590 --> 04:42:03.600 align:start position:0%
the only ones that served on those
 
04:42:05.830 --> 04:42:05.840 align:start position:0%
committees and served when they were
 
04:42:07.910 --> 04:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
really important and they are going to
 
04:42:10.470 --> 04:42:10.480 align:start position:0%
become important again if restructuring
 
04:42:11.830 --> 04:42:11.840 align:start position:0%
was important
 
04:42:17.030 --> 04:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:19.910 --> 04:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
what is this new energy that we're going
 
04:42:19.920 --> 04:42:22.310 align:start position:0%
what is this new energy that we're going
to

04:42:22.310 --> 04:42:22.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:42:25.350 --> 04:42:25.360 align:start position:0%
envision and happen in the future and
 
04:42:27.430 --> 04:42:27.440 align:start position:0%
how are we going to guide that
 
04:42:29.430 --> 04:42:29.440 align:start position:0%
for the state of new hampshire
 
04:42:30.948 --> 04:42:30.958 align:start position:0%
that's really
 
04:42:32.628 --> 04:42:32.638 align:start position:0%
really important
 
04:42:34.550 --> 04:42:34.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:42:36.550 --> 04:42:36.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative kelly pitts is
 
04:42:38.550 --> 04:42:38.560 align:start position:0%
one of the other people serving
 
04:42:40.150 --> 04:42:40.160 align:start position:0%
currently serving on this committee who
 
04:42:42.470 --> 04:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
has also served on the oversight
 
04:42:42.480 --> 04:42:44.628 align:start position:0%
has also served on the oversight
committee

04:42:44.628 --> 04:42:44.638 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:42:46.230 --> 04:42:46.240 align:start position:0%
i remember on
 
04:42:48.788 --> 04:42:48.798 align:start position:0%
one or two maybe more
 
04:42:50.390 --> 04:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
occasions that we
 
04:42:54.070 --> 04:42:54.080 align:start position:0%
got a presentation from someone or some
 
04:42:57.030 --> 04:42:57.040 align:start position:0%
organization about a topic of interest
 
04:42:57.040 --> 04:42:59.750 align:start position:0%
organization about a topic of interest
to

04:42:59.750 --> 04:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:01.670 --> 04:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
committee members about
 
04:43:04.628 --> 04:43:04.638 align:start position:0%
the energy sector
 
04:43:06.788 --> 04:43:06.798 align:start position:0%
and i can remember thinking at the time
 
04:43:09.670 --> 04:43:09.680 align:start position:0%
well these presentations are are quite
 
04:43:09.680 --> 04:43:11.590 align:start position:0%
well these presentations are are quite
informative

04:43:11.590 --> 04:43:11.600 align:start position:0%
informative
 
04:43:13.990 --> 04:43:14.000 align:start position:0%
and i wondered to myself why are we
 
04:43:16.550 --> 04:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
limiting these presentations to just
 
04:43:18.390 --> 04:43:18.400 align:start position:0%
this oversight committee
 
04:43:21.910 --> 04:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
the entire ste ought to be
 
04:43:23.270 --> 04:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
hearing these
 
04:43:23.280 --> 04:43:25.990 align:start position:0%
hearing these
presentations

04:43:25.990 --> 04:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
presentations
 
04:43:28.070 --> 04:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
and i believe that's true
 
04:43:29.830 --> 04:43:29.840 align:start position:0%
and one of my goals
 
04:43:32.150 --> 04:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
for the rest of this year is to set up
 
04:43:34.470 --> 04:43:34.480 align:start position:0%
several such presentations
 
04:43:36.628 --> 04:43:36.638 align:start position:0%
for this committee so that every single
 
04:43:38.628 --> 04:43:38.638 align:start position:0%
member of this committee can elevate his
 
04:43:40.868 --> 04:43:40.878 align:start position:0%
knowledge his or her knowledge base
 
04:43:43.030 --> 04:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
so that we can understand the issues we
 
04:43:45.190 --> 04:43:45.200 align:start position:0%
face more thoroughly
 
04:43:48.868 --> 04:43:48.878 align:start position:0%
and i concur with representative thomas
 
04:43:50.390 --> 04:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
that the oversight committee has
 
04:43:53.510 --> 04:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
outlived its usefulness
 
04:43:56.470 --> 04:43:56.480 align:start position:0%
but that doesn't mean that we have to
 
04:43:59.110 --> 04:43:59.120 align:start position:0%
ignore the good sources of information
 
04:44:01.030 --> 04:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
that are out there that we can all take
 
04:44:03.910 --> 04:44:03.920 align:start position:0%
advantage of and we can set up these
 
04:44:07.110 --> 04:44:07.120 align:start position:0%
presentations to the full committee
 
04:44:09.350 --> 04:44:09.360 align:start position:0%
and people can attend
 
04:44:11.270 --> 04:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
at their own choice whether they if they
 
04:44:13.190 --> 04:44:13.200 align:start position:0%
want to attend they can if they don't
 
04:44:14.708 --> 04:44:14.718 align:start position:0%
they don't have to
 
04:44:14.718 --> 04:44:16.470 align:start position:0%
they don't have to
so

04:44:16.470 --> 04:44:16.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:44:16.480 --> 04:44:18.230 align:start position:0%
so
i'm

04:44:18.230 --> 04:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
04:44:20.150 --> 04:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
that's by way of telling you that i'm in
 
04:44:22.230 --> 04:44:22.240 align:start position:0%
support of the itl
 
04:44:24.948 --> 04:44:24.958 align:start position:0%
or the uh the uh obelisk abolition of
 
04:44:26.868 --> 04:44:26.878 align:start position:0%
the committee but i'm not
 
04:44:30.550 --> 04:44:30.560 align:start position:0%
uh in favor of denying this committee
 
04:44:32.390 --> 04:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to learn more about what
 
04:44:34.628 --> 04:44:34.638 align:start position:0%
we do
 
04:44:37.270 --> 04:44:37.280 align:start position:0%
fun go ahead the oversight committees
 
04:44:38.788 --> 04:44:38.798 align:start position:0%
were never
 
04:44:38.798 --> 04:44:39.670 align:start position:0%
were never
ever

04:44:39.670 --> 04:44:39.680 align:start position:0%
ever
 
04:44:42.230 --> 04:44:42.240 align:start position:0%
limited to the oversight committee
 
04:44:44.470 --> 04:44:44.480 align:start position:0%
anyone could attend those meetings they
 
04:44:46.390 --> 04:44:46.400 align:start position:0%
have to be posted just like everything
 
04:44:46.400 --> 04:44:47.190 align:start position:0%
have to be posted just like everything
else

04:44:47.190 --> 04:44:47.200 align:start position:0%
else
 
04:44:49.270 --> 04:44:49.280 align:start position:0%
and anybody could attend so they were
 
04:44:50.628 --> 04:44:50.638 align:start position:0%
not limited
 
04:44:52.550 --> 04:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
but they could be
 
04:44:52.560 --> 04:44:54.830 align:start position:0%
but they could be
long

04:44:54.830 --> 04:44:54.840 align:start position:0%
long
 
04:44:56.310 --> 04:44:56.320 align:start position:0%
representative pimentel you had a
 
04:44:56.320 --> 04:44:57.830 align:start position:0%
representative pimentel you had a
comment

04:44:57.830 --> 04:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
comment
 
04:45:00.310 --> 04:45:00.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman when when the bill
 
04:45:03.030 --> 04:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
originally came up and we found out that
 
04:45:03.040 --> 04:45:04.390 align:start position:0%
originally came up and we found out that
uh

04:45:04.390 --> 04:45:04.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:45:06.150 --> 04:45:06.160 align:start position:0%
some of the things that were supposed to
 
04:45:07.270 --> 04:45:07.280 align:start position:0%
happen with the committee we were
 
04:45:09.350 --> 04:45:09.360 align:start position:0%
supposed to get a report
 
04:45:12.150 --> 04:45:12.160 align:start position:0%
which i was unaware we got and
 
04:45:14.550 --> 04:45:14.560 align:start position:0%
and found out that it was actually sent
 
04:45:16.628 --> 04:45:16.638 align:start position:0%
to you and you said
 
04:45:19.430 --> 04:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
that you had sent it to all of us
 
04:45:22.310 --> 04:45:22.320 align:start position:0%
and i went back and checked my email and
 
04:45:24.868 --> 04:45:24.878 align:start position:0%
there it was um
 
04:45:27.030 --> 04:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
it was a report that
 
04:45:28.948 --> 04:45:28.958 align:start position:0%
i did read at the time but i didn't know
 
04:45:31.910 --> 04:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
what it was and why i was getting it
 
04:45:31.920 --> 04:45:32.788 align:start position:0%
what it was and why i was getting it
and

04:45:32.788 --> 04:45:32.798 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:45:35.590 --> 04:45:35.600 align:start position:0%
and i guess that was that's a problem
 
04:45:35.600 --> 04:45:37.350 align:start position:0%
and i guess that was that's a problem
with

04:45:37.350 --> 04:45:37.360 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:45:37.360 --> 04:45:38.868 align:start position:0%
with
uh

04:45:38.868 --> 04:45:38.878 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:45:42.390 --> 04:45:42.400 align:start position:0%
the whole thing right now is that i
 
04:45:43.990 --> 04:45:44.000 align:start position:0%
feel like
 
04:45:46.948 --> 04:45:46.958 align:start position:0%
it should have gotten to some place and
 
04:45:51.510 --> 04:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
somehow been reviewed as the as a group
 
04:45:51.520 --> 04:45:53.670 align:start position:0%
somehow been reviewed as the as a group
and

04:45:53.670 --> 04:45:53.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:45:54.550 --> 04:45:54.560 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:45:56.390 --> 04:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
not just
 
04:45:56.400 --> 04:45:57.830 align:start position:0%
not just
read

04:45:57.830 --> 04:45:57.840 align:start position:0%
read
 
04:46:00.868 --> 04:46:00.878 align:start position:0%
singularly and try to digest what i
 
04:46:03.270 --> 04:46:03.280 align:start position:0%
could from it but to actually have a
 
04:46:05.830 --> 04:46:05.840 align:start position:0%
conversation about it and that didn't
 
04:46:05.840 --> 04:46:06.788 align:start position:0%
conversation about it and that didn't
happen

04:46:06.788 --> 04:46:06.798 align:start position:0%
happen
 
04:46:06.798 --> 04:46:10.230 align:start position:0%
happen
and

04:46:10.230 --> 04:46:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:12.230 --> 04:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
whether this committee is dissolved or
 
04:46:15.030 --> 04:46:15.040 align:start position:0%
not i mean the the issue is that that
 
04:46:17.830 --> 04:46:17.840 align:start position:0%
should have been discussed
 
04:46:19.590 --> 04:46:19.600 align:start position:0%
that's my comment
 
04:46:22.390 --> 04:46:22.400 align:start position:0%
that's a good point and
 
04:46:24.550 --> 04:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
i think going forward maybe we should
 
04:46:26.550 --> 04:46:26.560 align:start position:0%
schedule some committee sessions some
 
04:46:28.708 --> 04:46:28.718 align:start position:0%
committee work sessions to discuss these
 
04:46:30.550 --> 04:46:30.560 align:start position:0%
reports that we get
 
04:46:31.910 --> 04:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
and sit down and talk about them
 
04:46:34.390 --> 04:46:34.400 align:start position:0%
together go through them and and see if
 
04:46:36.550 --> 04:46:36.560 align:start position:0%
we can understand them and find out what
 
04:46:38.230 --> 04:46:38.240 align:start position:0%
their implications are
 
04:46:40.390 --> 04:46:40.400 align:start position:0%
representative plett
 
04:46:43.670 --> 04:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
yes uh afterwards
 
04:46:47.190 --> 04:46:47.200 align:start position:0%
a change in focus a year or so ago it's
 
04:46:49.110 --> 04:46:49.120 align:start position:0%
now the
 
04:46:50.550 --> 04:46:50.560 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight committee to
 
04:46:53.110 --> 04:46:53.120 align:start position:0%
monitor the transformation of delivery
 
04:46:55.270 --> 04:46:55.280 align:start position:0%
of electric services
 
04:46:57.270 --> 04:46:57.280 align:start position:0%
and frankly that's pretty stable the
 
04:47:00.150 --> 04:47:00.160 align:start position:0%
delivery is the delivery and so i don't
 
04:47:01.990 --> 04:47:02.000 align:start position:0%
see any need for this committee to exist
 
04:47:05.430 --> 04:47:05.440 align:start position:0%
anymore however if it however
 
04:47:08.628 --> 04:47:08.638 align:start position:0%
if somebody sees a need for to look at
 
04:47:10.708 --> 04:47:10.718 align:start position:0%
the different energy sources in the
 
04:47:12.948 --> 04:47:12.958 align:start position:0%
future and how that might change you can
 
04:47:15.110 --> 04:47:15.120 align:start position:0%
always create a committee to do that or
 
04:47:15.120 --> 04:47:16.788 align:start position:0%
always create a committee to do that or
commission

04:47:16.788 --> 04:47:16.798 align:start position:0%
commission
 
04:47:19.430 --> 04:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
thank you representative masimilio
 
04:47:21.190 --> 04:47:21.200 align:start position:0%
so am i correct
 
04:47:23.110 --> 04:47:23.120 align:start position:0%
in saying that
 
04:47:24.430 --> 04:47:24.440 align:start position:0%
the committee's
 
04:47:26.868 --> 04:47:26.878 align:start position:0%
responsibility would be taking over by
 
04:47:31.110 --> 04:47:31.120 align:start position:0%
des and the department of energy or no
 
04:47:33.670 --> 04:47:33.680 align:start position:0%
you say that again who's taking what
 
04:47:35.590 --> 04:47:35.600 align:start position:0%
from des
 
04:47:38.550 --> 04:47:38.560 align:start position:0%
if the committee is dissolved
 
04:47:41.350 --> 04:47:41.360 align:start position:0%
would des and then the department of
 
04:47:43.350 --> 04:47:43.360 align:start position:0%
energy be responsible for what the
 
04:47:46.150 --> 04:47:46.160 align:start position:0%
committee was responsible for or no
 
04:47:48.868 --> 04:47:48.878 align:start position:0%
no the the des and and department of
 
04:47:50.868 --> 04:47:50.878 align:start position:0%
energy are responsible for generating
 
04:47:53.190 --> 04:47:53.200 align:start position:0%
reports and we are the recipients of
 
04:47:54.628 --> 04:47:54.638 align:start position:0%
those reports
 
04:47:56.788 --> 04:47:56.798 align:start position:0%
but they have no responsibility about
 
04:47:58.948 --> 04:47:58.958 align:start position:0%
what we do with those reports
 
04:48:02.628 --> 04:48:02.638 align:start position:0%
and so the oversight committee
 
04:48:04.470 --> 04:48:04.480 align:start position:0%
as i recall when i served on it didn't
 
04:48:06.470 --> 04:48:06.480 align:start position:0%
really spend much time looking at those
 
04:48:09.190 --> 04:48:09.200 align:start position:0%
reports itself
 
04:48:10.948 --> 04:48:10.958 align:start position:0%
the chairman of the committee frequently
 
04:48:13.670 --> 04:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
brought in people to make presentations
 
04:48:15.830 --> 04:48:15.840 align:start position:0%
to the committee and they were open
 
04:48:18.150 --> 04:48:18.160 align:start position:0%
meetings as representative callie pitts
 
04:48:19.990 --> 04:48:20.000 align:start position:0%
pointed out they weren't restricted just
 
04:48:21.590 --> 04:48:21.600 align:start position:0%
to the members of the committee anybody
 
04:48:23.750 --> 04:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
could attend
 
04:48:25.750 --> 04:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead follow up so what was the
 
04:48:32.230 --> 04:48:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:35.190 --> 04:48:35.200 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts can help me
 
04:48:37.430 --> 04:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
answer that question my recollection of
 
04:48:40.628 --> 04:48:40.638 align:start position:0%
the responsibility of the committee was
 
04:48:43.030 --> 04:48:43.040 align:start position:0%
simply to
 
04:48:45.670 --> 04:48:45.680 align:start position:0%
provide oversight originally when it was
 
04:48:47.270 --> 04:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
the way it was established to provide
 
04:48:50.390 --> 04:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
oversight of the restructuring process
 
04:48:53.350 --> 04:48:53.360 align:start position:0%
which turned out to be a 20-year process
 
04:48:55.830 --> 04:48:55.840 align:start position:0%
but it finally was finished
 
04:48:57.590 --> 04:48:57.600 align:start position:0%
about two years ago
 
04:48:59.510 --> 04:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
and that's one of the reasons why
 
04:49:01.350 --> 04:49:01.360 align:start position:0%
this bill exists
 
04:49:03.270 --> 04:49:03.280 align:start position:0%
since the committee's original purpose
 
04:49:05.030 --> 04:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
has been
 
04:49:07.030 --> 04:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
delivered on
 
04:49:07.040 --> 04:49:08.470 align:start position:0%
delivered on
completed

04:49:08.470 --> 04:49:08.480 align:start position:0%
completed
 
04:49:10.948 --> 04:49:10.958 align:start position:0%
there seems to be no more need for this
 
04:49:12.868 --> 04:49:12.878 align:start position:0%
committee to exist
 
04:49:14.628 --> 04:49:14.638 align:start position:0%
did i have that right representative
 
04:49:16.788 --> 04:49:16.798 align:start position:0%
callie pitts the initial responsibility
 
04:49:19.510 --> 04:49:19.520 align:start position:0%
was to oversee you correct
 
04:49:22.628 --> 04:49:22.638 align:start position:0%
restructuring and and the impact on the
 
04:49:24.150 --> 04:49:24.160 align:start position:0%
state in new hampshire
 
04:49:26.070 --> 04:49:26.080 align:start position:0%
and to see that everything went smoothly
 
04:49:27.830 --> 04:49:27.840 align:start position:0%
and that was i believe that was
 
04:49:29.990 --> 04:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
accomplished fairly well
 
04:49:32.708 --> 04:49:32.718 align:start position:0%
if restructuring is over my answer to
 
04:49:34.788 --> 04:49:34.798 align:start position:0%
that is it is not
 
04:49:37.750 --> 04:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
we are in the process of restructuring
 
04:49:40.788 --> 04:49:40.798 align:start position:0%
the way our energy is delivered
 
04:49:44.150 --> 04:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
and how and and how we get it
 
04:49:47.270 --> 04:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
and that's not going to be 20 years when
 
04:49:50.868 --> 04:49:50.878 align:start position:0%
you say the stability of the uh of the
 
04:49:53.030 --> 04:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
energy delivery system
 
04:49:55.110 --> 04:49:55.120 align:start position:0%
will everybody's panic and shaken a
 
04:49:57.430 --> 04:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
little bit about what happens when the
 
04:49:59.110 --> 04:49:59.120 align:start position:0%
grid goes out
 
04:50:01.510 --> 04:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
what happens with a cyber attack what
 
04:50:04.628 --> 04:50:04.638 align:start position:0%
and and are our responsibility as an
 
04:50:04.638 --> 04:50:05.670 align:start position:0%
and and are our responsibility as an
elected

04:50:05.670 --> 04:50:05.680 align:start position:0%
elected
 
04:50:07.350 --> 04:50:07.360 align:start position:0%
committee would be to say
 
04:50:09.670 --> 04:50:09.680 align:start position:0%
how are you prepared what are you doing
 
04:50:11.670 --> 04:50:11.680 align:start position:0%
for these things and to probe those
 
04:50:13.510 --> 04:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
things in debt
 
04:50:16.070 --> 04:50:16.080 align:start position:0%
as i brought out here when we had they
 
04:50:18.948 --> 04:50:18.958 align:start position:0%
had testified and had the storm
 
04:50:21.750 --> 04:50:21.760 align:start position:0%
we were told well you know there was
 
04:50:23.190 --> 04:50:23.200 align:start position:0%
this there was that there was the other
 
04:50:25.670 --> 04:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
thing the thing was they didn't have the
 
04:50:27.590 --> 04:50:27.600 align:start position:0%
equipment to get it back they didn't
 
04:50:29.990 --> 04:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
keep enough storage
 
04:50:32.150 --> 04:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
and the committee took care of that and
 
04:50:33.750 --> 04:50:33.760 align:start position:0%
said you will
 
04:50:36.628 --> 04:50:36.638 align:start position:0%
and you will report to us about where
 
04:50:40.708 --> 04:50:40.718 align:start position:0%
you stand and how much you can withstand
 
04:50:43.110 --> 04:50:43.120 align:start position:0%
uh and it wasn't drivers or anything it
 
04:50:46.390 --> 04:50:46.400 align:start position:0%
was just basic equipment
 
04:50:49.270 --> 04:50:49.280 align:start position:0%
now to me more than ever it is critical
 
04:50:52.390 --> 04:50:52.400 align:start position:0%
to stay on top of those issues
 
04:50:54.628 --> 04:50:54.638 align:start position:0%
and we hear that all our agencies
 
04:50:56.390 --> 04:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
department of energy in particular oh
 
04:50:57.750 --> 04:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
we've got to hire another person oh
 
04:50:57.760 --> 04:50:58.830 align:start position:0%
we've got to hire another person oh
we're

04:50:58.830 --> 04:50:58.840 align:start position:0%
we're
 
04:51:01.670 --> 04:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
outstretched somebody's got to do it and
 
04:51:04.550 --> 04:51:04.560 align:start position:0%
it's it's work that is important
 
04:51:07.910 --> 04:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
it's not important now maybe
 
04:51:09.990 --> 04:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
but when something happens
 
04:51:11.990 --> 04:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
if we're prepared it's very important
 
04:51:14.470 --> 04:51:14.480 align:start position:0%
that's not only emergency preparedness
 
04:51:16.310 --> 04:51:16.320 align:start position:0%
this is checking with the utilities how
 
04:51:17.750 --> 04:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
are you keeping your stock what are you
 
04:51:17.760 --> 04:51:19.510 align:start position:0%
are you keeping your stock what are you
doing

04:51:19.510 --> 04:51:19.520 align:start position:0%
doing
 
04:51:21.350 --> 04:51:21.360 align:start position:0%
uh i think
 
04:51:21.360 --> 04:51:22.708 align:start position:0%
uh i think
again

04:51:22.708 --> 04:51:22.718 align:start position:0%
again
 
04:51:25.750 --> 04:51:25.760 align:start position:0%
committee or no committee
 
04:51:28.070 --> 04:51:28.080 align:start position:0%
which i'm sure this is going to fail
 
04:51:30.230 --> 04:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
this bill is going to pass
 
04:51:32.788 --> 04:51:32.798 align:start position:0%
that somebody and this then this
 
04:51:34.948 --> 04:51:34.958 align:start position:0%
committee as a whole
 
04:51:38.310 --> 04:51:38.320 align:start position:0%
has to take on that role and be sure
 
04:51:40.708 --> 04:51:40.718 align:start position:0%
that our delivery systems are where they
 
04:51:44.070 --> 04:51:44.080 align:start position:0%
should be in this state
 
04:51:44.080 --> 04:51:45.030 align:start position:0%
should be in this state
that

04:51:45.030 --> 04:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:51:47.590 --> 04:51:47.600 align:start position:0%
our energy transition is what it should
 
04:51:49.830 --> 04:51:49.840 align:start position:0%
be because we are in restructuring make
 
04:51:53.350 --> 04:51:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:54.830 --> 04:51:54.840 align:start position:0%
and that that goes
 
04:51:58.390 --> 04:51:58.400 align:start position:0%
smoothly we need to keep on top of it
 
04:52:00.310 --> 04:52:00.320 align:start position:0%
not that we can do it
 
04:52:02.390 --> 04:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
but we need to keep on top of it and
 
04:52:06.788 --> 04:52:06.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:08.788 --> 04:52:08.798 align:start position:0%
and a committee
 
04:52:11.190 --> 04:52:11.200 align:start position:0%
has the authority to ask for that
 
04:52:13.990 --> 04:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
information so does this committee
 
04:52:16.788 --> 04:52:16.798 align:start position:0%
but does this committee by itself have
 
04:52:18.868 --> 04:52:18.878 align:start position:0%
the time the other advantage of a
 
04:52:20.628 --> 04:52:20.638 align:start position:0%
committee like that is it has members of
 
04:52:22.230 --> 04:52:22.240 align:start position:0%
the senate on it
 
04:52:24.310 --> 04:52:24.320 align:start position:0%
who sometimes show up and who sometimes
 
04:52:24.320 --> 04:52:25.510 align:start position:0%
who sometimes show up and who sometimes
don't

04:52:25.510 --> 04:52:25.520 align:start position:0%
don't
 
04:52:28.310 --> 04:52:28.320 align:start position:0%
but at least that allows us to work
 
04:52:28.320 --> 04:52:30.390 align:start position:0%
but at least that allows us to work
together

04:52:30.390 --> 04:52:30.400 align:start position:0%
together
 
04:52:33.670 --> 04:52:33.680 align:start position:0%
so those are the important things
 
04:52:35.190 --> 04:52:35.200 align:start position:0%
and that's all
 
04:52:37.750 --> 04:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:40.070 --> 04:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
i would point out that
 
04:52:42.230 --> 04:52:42.240 align:start position:0%
restructuring had a very precise
 
04:52:44.310 --> 04:52:44.320 align:start position:0%
definition to it
 
04:52:47.030 --> 04:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
when the oversight committee was
 
04:52:50.830 --> 04:52:50.840 align:start position:0%
created to oversee restructuring
 
04:52:50.840 --> 04:52:52.470 align:start position:0%
created to oversee restructuring
restructuring

04:52:52.470 --> 04:52:52.480 align:start position:0%
restructuring
 
04:52:55.270 --> 04:52:55.280 align:start position:0%
as defined at the time
 
04:52:57.350 --> 04:52:57.360 align:start position:0%
didn't mean
 
04:52:59.110 --> 04:52:59.120 align:start position:0%
well where are we going in the future it
 
04:52:59.120 --> 04:53:00.070 align:start position:0%
well where are we going in the future it
meant

04:53:00.070 --> 04:53:00.080 align:start position:0%
meant
 
04:53:02.708 --> 04:53:02.718 align:start position:0%
how are you going to accomplish the
 
04:53:06.230 --> 04:53:06.240 align:start position:0%
divestiture divestiture of generation
 
04:53:08.470 --> 04:53:08.480 align:start position:0%
devices to become
 
04:53:10.390 --> 04:53:10.400 align:start position:0%
simply delivery
 
04:53:13.030 --> 04:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
vehicles for electricity that was the
 
04:53:15.190 --> 04:53:15.200 align:start position:0%
definition of restructuring
 
04:53:17.590 --> 04:53:17.600 align:start position:0%
and we've accomplished that that has
 
04:53:17.600 --> 04:53:18.550 align:start position:0%
and we've accomplished that that has
happened

04:53:18.550 --> 04:53:18.560 align:start position:0%
happened
 
04:53:21.350 --> 04:53:21.360 align:start position:0%
that divestiture has been completed you
 
04:53:23.190 --> 04:53:23.200 align:start position:0%
were using the word a few minutes ago
 
04:53:25.830 --> 04:53:25.840 align:start position:0%
restructuring in the sense of where are
 
04:53:27.910 --> 04:53:27.920 align:start position:0%
we going in the future and while that's
 
04:53:29.830 --> 04:53:29.840 align:start position:0%
an important topic
 
04:53:31.910 --> 04:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
i would argue that the creation of the
 
04:53:36.788 --> 04:53:36.798 align:start position:0%
department of energy by hp2 last summer
 
04:53:38.628 --> 04:53:38.638 align:start position:0%
has given us a vehicle
 
04:53:38.638 --> 04:53:40.868 align:start position:0%
has given us a vehicle
for

04:53:40.868 --> 04:53:40.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:43.670 --> 04:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
watching the development of energy in
 
04:53:47.750 --> 04:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
the future and plotting where that
 
04:53:50.470 --> 04:53:50.480 align:start position:0%
future may go the department of energy
 
04:53:52.868 --> 04:53:52.878 align:start position:0%
has a policy role to play
 
04:53:55.350 --> 04:53:55.360 align:start position:0%
in developing
 
04:53:58.310 --> 04:53:58.320 align:start position:0%
what will happen in our energy future
 
04:53:58.320 --> 04:53:59.110 align:start position:0%
what will happen in our energy future
and

04:53:59.110 --> 04:53:59.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:54:00.948 --> 04:54:00.958 align:start position:0%
i don't think that we need this
 
04:54:02.470 --> 04:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
oversight committee
 
04:54:04.310 --> 04:54:04.320 align:start position:0%
when we have the department of energy
 
04:54:06.628 --> 04:54:06.638 align:start position:0%
which hasn't even had a really an
 
04:54:08.948 --> 04:54:08.958 align:start position:0%
opportunity yet to show
 
04:54:11.590 --> 04:54:11.600 align:start position:0%
how it can
 
04:54:14.230 --> 04:54:14.240 align:start position:0%
guide our energy future i think we need
 
04:54:15.590 --> 04:54:15.600 align:start position:0%
to let it
 
04:54:17.510 --> 04:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
show us what it can do
 
04:54:19.510 --> 04:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
and we don't really need
 
04:54:23.030 --> 04:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:25.270 --> 04:54:25.280 align:start position:0%
of this committee a subcommittee of this
 
04:54:27.190 --> 04:54:27.200 align:start position:0%
committee to do that
 
04:54:28.948 --> 04:54:28.958 align:start position:0%
even if it does include some members of
 
04:54:31.350 --> 04:54:31.360 align:start position:0%
the senate because
 
04:54:33.910 --> 04:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
let's face it when the radio when this
 
04:54:37.350 --> 04:54:37.360 align:start position:0%
committee was redefined two years ago
 
04:54:39.510 --> 04:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
its purpose was defined in such a way
 
04:54:41.430 --> 04:54:41.440 align:start position:0%
that was so vague
 
04:54:43.350 --> 04:54:43.360 align:start position:0%
that as representative thomas has
 
04:54:45.110 --> 04:54:45.120 align:start position:0%
pointed out the committee hasn't even
 
04:54:47.590 --> 04:54:47.600 align:start position:0%
met for a couple years now covet had
 
04:54:50.310 --> 04:54:50.320 align:start position:0%
something to do with that i agree but
 
04:54:52.230 --> 04:54:52.240 align:start position:0%
the the
 
04:54:53.910 --> 04:54:53.920 align:start position:0%
the definition of the committee's
 
04:54:56.150 --> 04:54:56.160 align:start position:0%
purpose was very vague in that previous
 
04:54:58.230 --> 04:54:58.240 align:start position:0%
legislation and it hasn't served the
 
04:54:59.510 --> 04:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
committee well
 
04:54:59.520 --> 04:55:00.868 align:start position:0%
committee well
i

04:55:00.868 --> 04:55:00.878 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:55:04.150 --> 04:55:04.160 align:start position:0%
respond because there was two things
 
04:55:06.070 --> 04:55:06.080 align:start position:0%
when restructuring happened the first
 
04:55:07.670 --> 04:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
thing we had to do was find out if we
 
04:55:09.750 --> 04:55:09.760 align:start position:0%
were going to restructure
 
04:55:12.470 --> 04:55:12.480 align:start position:0%
and how that would affect us the second
 
04:55:15.670 --> 04:55:15.680 align:start position:0%
thing that that i take a little bit of
 
04:55:17.670 --> 04:55:17.680 align:start position:0%
umbrage was was that the des makes
 
04:55:19.830 --> 04:55:19.840 align:start position:0%
policy they do not the legislature makes
 
04:55:22.868 --> 04:55:22.878 align:start position:0%
policy and if they if if they are making
 
04:55:25.030 --> 04:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
policy they shouldn't be they should be
 
04:55:27.990 --> 04:55:28.000 align:start position:0%
following policy the legislature is the
 
04:55:28.000 --> 04:55:29.110 align:start position:0%
following policy the legislature is the
leader

04:55:29.110 --> 04:55:29.120 align:start position:0%
leader
 
04:55:31.270 --> 04:55:31.280 align:start position:0%
they inform us they tell us what they
 
04:55:31.280 --> 04:55:32.628 align:start position:0%
they inform us they tell us what they
need

04:55:32.628 --> 04:55:32.638 align:start position:0%
need
 
04:55:35.670 --> 04:55:35.680 align:start position:0%
and then we ultimately decide is this
 
04:55:37.990 --> 04:55:38.000 align:start position:0%
what you want so those are two things i
 
04:55:40.390 --> 04:55:40.400 align:start position:0%
would point that but
 
04:55:42.868 --> 04:55:42.878 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to belabor it anymore
 
04:55:45.670 --> 04:55:45.680 align:start position:0%
whatever happens this committee and this
 
04:55:49.350 --> 04:55:49.360 align:start position:0%
legislature is responsible
 
04:55:50.708 --> 04:55:50.718 align:start position:0%
but what
 
04:55:50.718 --> 04:55:52.310 align:start position:0%
but what
regulatory

04:55:52.310 --> 04:55:52.320 align:start position:0%
regulatory
 
04:55:54.390 --> 04:55:54.400 align:start position:0%
agencies do is they
 
04:55:54.400 --> 04:55:55.670 align:start position:0%
agencies do is they
oversee

04:55:55.670 --> 04:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
oversee
 
04:56:00.310 --> 04:56:00.320 align:start position:0%
policy and they implement policy so
 
04:56:00.320 --> 04:56:01.830 align:start position:0%
policy and they implement policy so
the

04:56:01.830 --> 04:56:01.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:56:04.628 --> 04:56:04.638 align:start position:0%
the doe has a role to play as an
 
04:56:07.670 --> 04:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
overseer to make sure that policies that
 
04:56:09.670 --> 04:56:09.680 align:start position:0%
have been implemented and procedures
 
04:56:11.110 --> 04:56:11.120 align:start position:0%
that have put in place rules that have
 
04:56:13.590 --> 04:56:13.600 align:start position:0%
been been put in place
 
04:56:15.190 --> 04:56:15.200 align:start position:0%
are followed
 
04:56:15.200 --> 04:56:17.910 align:start position:0%
are followed
and

04:56:17.910 --> 04:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:19.430 --> 04:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
i think that's part of what the
 
04:56:22.150 --> 04:56:22.160 align:start position:0%
oversight committee used to do but it
 
04:56:25.030 --> 04:56:25.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't need to do that anymore
 
04:56:26.390 --> 04:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee did you have a
 
04:56:26.400 --> 04:56:27.510 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee did you have a
comment

04:56:27.510 --> 04:56:27.520 align:start position:0%
comment
 
04:56:27.520 --> 04:56:28.470 align:start position:0%
comment
um

04:56:28.470 --> 04:56:28.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:56:29.750 --> 04:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
yes i did
 
04:56:33.030 --> 04:56:33.040 align:start position:0%
um i think you know we're we're probably
 
04:56:36.230 --> 04:56:36.240 align:start position:0%
predisposed in different ways to look at
 
04:56:39.190 --> 04:56:39.200 align:start position:0%
the value of having
 
04:56:41.030 --> 04:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
an oversight committee made up of folks
 
04:56:43.990 --> 04:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
who are in the legislature versus inside
 
04:56:46.470 --> 04:56:46.480 align:start position:0%
an agency
 
04:56:49.270 --> 04:56:49.280 align:start position:0%
you know under the executive branch and
 
04:56:52.470 --> 04:56:52.480 align:start position:0%
how policy gets determined
 
04:56:55.190 --> 04:56:55.200 align:start position:0%
it could be the whims of the political
 
04:56:57.190 --> 04:56:57.200 align:start position:0%
nature versus
 
04:56:59.910 --> 04:56:59.920 align:start position:0%
um you know elected folks who are who
 
04:57:01.910 --> 04:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
are working uh giving their time trying
 
04:57:03.190 --> 04:57:03.200 align:start position:0%
to come up with the best solutions for
 
04:57:04.868 --> 04:57:04.878 align:start position:0%
the state and i'm not saying that the
 
04:57:06.310 --> 04:57:06.320 align:start position:0%
folks in our agencies don't have the
 
04:57:07.830 --> 04:57:07.840 align:start position:0%
best interests of the state in mind i'm
 
04:57:10.310 --> 04:57:10.320 align:start position:0%
sure they do
 
04:57:11.830 --> 04:57:11.840 align:start position:0%
but i guess
 
04:57:14.550 --> 04:57:14.560 align:start position:0%
we're seeing a number of bills that are
 
04:57:16.550 --> 04:57:16.560 align:start position:0%
taking aim at
 
04:57:16.560 --> 04:57:17.430 align:start position:0%
taking aim at
at

04:57:17.430 --> 04:57:17.440 align:start position:0%
at
 
04:57:20.788 --> 04:57:20.798 align:start position:0%
oversight stakeholder processes
 
04:57:22.708 --> 04:57:22.718 align:start position:0%
and things that were put in place to try
 
04:57:25.670 --> 04:57:25.680 align:start position:0%
and help us have
 
04:57:28.070 --> 04:57:28.080 align:start position:0%
separate entities that would then advise
 
04:57:28.080 --> 04:57:29.510 align:start position:0%
separate entities that would then advise
us

04:57:29.510 --> 04:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
us
 
04:57:31.430 --> 04:57:31.440 align:start position:0%
and bring information to us because we
 
04:57:32.948 --> 04:57:32.958 align:start position:0%
don't really have the time in this
 
04:57:32.958 --> 04:57:33.910 align:start position:0%
don't really have the time in this
committee

04:57:33.910 --> 04:57:33.920 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:57:35.350 --> 04:57:35.360 align:start position:0%
to do
 
04:57:37.750 --> 04:57:37.760 align:start position:0%
we don't do discussions around oversight
 
04:57:39.670 --> 04:57:39.680 align:start position:0%
and what we're trying to accomplish in
 
04:57:41.110 --> 04:57:41.120 align:start position:0%
the year we just all bring in our
 
04:57:42.708 --> 04:57:42.718 align:start position:0%
different bill ideas and we fight for
 
04:57:44.310 --> 04:57:44.320 align:start position:0%
them and then we vote on them
 
04:57:46.470 --> 04:57:46.480 align:start position:0%
and so it i think that this
 
04:57:48.470 --> 04:57:48.480 align:start position:0%
committee from my understanding the
 
04:57:50.868 --> 04:57:50.878 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight committee played a
 
04:57:52.550 --> 04:57:52.560 align:start position:0%
different role
 
04:57:52.560 --> 04:57:53.510 align:start position:0%
different role
which

04:57:53.510 --> 04:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
which
 
04:57:56.948 --> 04:57:56.958 align:start position:0%
uh although your explanation recently uh
 
04:57:58.788 --> 04:57:58.798 align:start position:0%
mr chair was that
 
04:58:00.948 --> 04:58:00.958 align:start position:0%
it might be appropriate under policy for
 
04:58:02.788 --> 04:58:02.798 align:start position:0%
that to go into the doe and we'll see
 
04:58:05.270 --> 04:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
whether or not they fill that role
 
04:58:06.628 --> 04:58:06.638 align:start position:0%
i don't think it i have heard it
 
04:58:08.868 --> 04:58:08.878 align:start position:0%
described as one of their roles and so
 
04:58:10.070 --> 04:58:10.080 align:start position:0%
that that's
 
04:58:11.750 --> 04:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
my concern is that we will be
 
04:58:13.670 --> 04:58:13.680 align:start position:0%
eliminating something that is of value
 
04:58:17.030 --> 04:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
to us and to the state
 
04:58:19.110 --> 04:58:19.120 align:start position:0%
because we didn't understand what value
 
04:58:20.948 --> 04:58:20.958 align:start position:0%
it could play and we are at least still
 
04:58:22.948 --> 04:58:22.958 align:start position:0%
in a transition we may not be in the
 
04:58:25.670 --> 04:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
transition that started the committee
 
04:58:29.030 --> 04:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
but um but in terms of questions that
 
04:58:31.910 --> 04:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
need answers around how we go forward
 
04:58:34.788 --> 04:58:34.798 align:start position:0%
we are still in that place
 
04:58:36.948 --> 04:58:36.958 align:start position:0%
representative pementel
 
04:58:39.430 --> 04:58:39.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
04:58:43.030 --> 04:58:43.040 align:start position:0%
this legislative oversight committee
 
04:58:43.040 --> 04:58:44.708 align:start position:0%
this legislative oversight committee
um

04:58:44.708 --> 04:58:44.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:58:49.990 --> 04:58:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:54.390 --> 04:58:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:56.390 --> 04:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
tasked the tasks they were
 
04:58:57.910 --> 04:58:57.920 align:start position:0%
to fulfill
 
04:58:57.920 --> 04:58:58.868 align:start position:0%
to fulfill
may

04:58:58.868 --> 04:58:58.878 align:start position:0%
may
 
04:59:01.670 --> 04:59:01.680 align:start position:0%
or may not be complete i'm not really
 
04:59:01.680 --> 04:59:02.628 align:start position:0%
or may not be complete i'm not really
sure

04:59:02.628 --> 04:59:02.638 align:start position:0%
sure
 
04:59:02.638 --> 04:59:04.150 align:start position:0%
sure
but

04:59:04.150 --> 04:59:04.160 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:59:06.390 --> 04:59:06.400 align:start position:0%
the need for a legislative oversight
 
04:59:06.400 --> 04:59:07.510 align:start position:0%
the need for a legislative oversight
committee

04:59:07.510 --> 04:59:07.520 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:59:07.520 --> 04:59:08.470 align:start position:0%
committee
is

04:59:08.470 --> 04:59:08.480 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:59:09.590 --> 04:59:09.600 align:start position:0%
i think
 
04:59:13.190 --> 04:59:13.200 align:start position:0%
extremely important and to actually
 
04:59:13.200 --> 04:59:15.670 align:start position:0%
extremely important and to actually
um

04:59:15.670 --> 04:59:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:15.680 --> 04:59:17.830 align:start position:0%
 
basically

04:59:17.830 --> 04:59:17.840 align:start position:0%
basically
 
04:59:20.150 --> 04:59:20.160 align:start position:0%
kill this committee
 
04:59:20.160 --> 04:59:20.868 align:start position:0%
kill this committee
and

04:59:20.868 --> 04:59:20.878 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:59:23.990 --> 04:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
and not have a replacement it seems to
 
04:59:25.350 --> 04:59:25.360 align:start position:0%
me that
 
04:59:27.670 --> 04:59:27.680 align:start position:0%
if we want to do something
 
04:59:30.550 --> 04:59:30.560 align:start position:0%
that makes a lot more sense maybe
 
04:59:34.470 --> 04:59:34.480 align:start position:0%
give the legislative oversight committee
 
04:59:37.350 --> 04:59:37.360 align:start position:0%
a different um
 
04:59:39.590 --> 04:59:39.600 align:start position:0%
uh a different
 
04:59:39.600 --> 04:59:40.868 align:start position:0%
uh a different
goal

04:59:40.868 --> 04:59:40.878 align:start position:0%
goal
 
04:59:40.878 --> 04:59:41.830 align:start position:0%
goal
than

04:59:41.830 --> 04:59:41.840 align:start position:0%
than
 
04:59:44.868 --> 04:59:44.878 align:start position:0%
the goal that this committee was given
 
04:59:46.948 --> 04:59:46.958 align:start position:0%
but not to actually
 
04:59:46.958 --> 04:59:48.230 align:start position:0%
but not to actually
um

04:59:48.230 --> 04:59:48.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:59:49.670 --> 04:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
absolve the
 
04:59:52.708 --> 04:59:52.718 align:start position:0%
uh dissolve the committee completely
 
04:59:56.470 --> 04:59:56.480 align:start position:0%
we really need an oversight committee
 
04:59:58.200 --> 04:59:58.210 align:start position:0%
so it should just be
 
04:59:58.210 --> 04:59:59.590 align:start position:0%
so it should just be
[Music]

04:59:59.590 --> 04:59:59.600 align:start position:0%

05:00:02.788 --> 05:00:02.798 align:start position:0%

not
 
05:00:03.920 --> 05:00:08.150 align:start position:0%
