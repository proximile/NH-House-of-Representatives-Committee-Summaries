bill seeing done as a typical courtesy
 
00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:27.440 align:start position:0%
can I get somebody to introduce the bill
 
00:19:38.029 --> 00:19:38.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:39.549 --> 00:19:39.559 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh representative
 
00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
Seth Miller uh straford 21 introducing
 
00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
House Bill 758 to establish a committee
 
00:19:48.669 --> 00:19:48.679 align:start position:0%
to study airport operation hours and
 
00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:51.880 align:start position:0%
provides duties there too uh this bill
 
00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:53.880 align:start position:0%
establishes a committee to study airport
 
00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:56.240 align:start position:0%
operation hours it is made up of members
 
00:19:59.270 --> 00:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
of the house and the Senate um um and
 
00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
their duties shall include but not be
 
00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:04.120 align:start position:0%
limited to study how to create a noise
 
00:20:05.710 --> 00:20:05.720 align:start position:0%
abatement measures for airport operation
 
00:20:07.149 --> 00:20:07.159 align:start position:0%
hours in the state of New Hampshire and
 
00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:08.480 align:start position:0%
identify the appropriate Federal
 
00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
authorities to carry out such an
 
00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
abatement the study should explore
 
00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
whether New Hampshire should consider
 
00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
prohibiting airplane flights from
 
00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
departing New Hampshire airports between
 
00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:17.440 align:start position:0%
the hours of 12:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. it
 
00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
should examine the advantages and
 
00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:20.440 align:start position:0%
disadvantages of such a Prohibition and
 
00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:23.200 align:start position:0%
involve discussions with relative
 
00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
stakeholders thank you very much sir y
 
00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
uh the only person that signed up to
 
00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:31.280 align:start position:0%
speak again reminder if you want to sign

recognizes without taking a position on
 
00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:44.440 align:start position:0%
the bill representing the Hampshire
 
00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:45.640 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation Bureau of
 
00:20:48.549 --> 00:20:48.559 align:start position:0%

00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
Lambert is it uh well I'll wait till you
 
00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:52.270 align:start position:0%
Lambert is it uh well I'll wait till you
get

00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:52.280 align:start position:0%
get
 
00:20:59.630 --> 00:20:59.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:03.080 align:start position:0%
sorry about that it's Tuesday not
 
00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:07.480 align:start position:0%
Monday um I came today just can I just
 
00:21:09.549 --> 00:21:09.559 align:start position:0%
get you to introduce yourself represent
 
00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:11.360 align:start position:0%
Trisha Lambert I'm the administrator for
 
00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
the Bureau of Aeronautics and I'm here
 
00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:17.320 align:start position:0%
just to provide um technical information
 
00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
for this bill I know it's just for a
 
00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
committee um should it come to pass
 
00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:23.880 align:start position:0%
we're happy to um assist with that
 
00:21:26.789 --> 00:21:26.799 align:start position:0%
process when if it comes to be
 
00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:32.960 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to bring forward I guess
 
00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
two points for this bill um the airports
 
00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:38.440 align:start position:0%
in the there are 25 open to the public
 
00:21:41.269 --> 00:21:41.279 align:start position:0%
airports within the state 12 of them are
 
00:21:41.279 --> 00:21:42.310 align:start position:0%
airports within the state 12 of them are
federally

00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:42.320 align:start position:0%
federally
 
00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:46.840 align:start position:0%
funded um this um committee if
 
00:21:48.789 --> 00:21:48.799 align:start position:0%
established would look at closure of
 
00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:51.400 align:start position:0%
that airport between 12 and 6 12 and
 
00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:52.269 align:start position:0%
that airport between 12 and 6 12 and
6:00

00:21:52.269 --> 00:21:52.279 align:start position:0%
6:00
 
00:21:54.789 --> 00:21:54.799 align:start position:0%
a.m. there are 12 airports that receive
 
00:21:58.710 --> 00:21:58.720 align:start position:0%
federal funds that have Grant insurances
 
00:22:00.789 --> 00:22:00.799 align:start position:0%
that require them to be open during that
 
00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:04.240 align:start position:0%
time without any type of um impact on
 
00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
that um and I guess the second point
 
00:22:08.549 --> 00:22:08.559 align:start position:0%
would be is that majority of your goods
 
00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
come in at during those hours um for
 
00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
cargo in the case of Manchester it is
 
00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
the third largest cargo airport in New
 
00:22:18.269 --> 00:22:18.279 align:start position:0%
England and that would curtail those
 
00:22:20.669 --> 00:22:20.679 align:start position:0%
operations and they would have to figure
 
00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
out something different because they
 
00:22:24.789 --> 00:22:24.799 align:start position:0%
typically come in during that time frame
 
00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
so um I guess I'll leave it at that um
 
00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
it is a committee so we're happy to
 
00:22:32.029 --> 00:22:32.039 align:start position:0%
assist in the future if if that's what
 
00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:34.600 align:start position:0%
we need to do thank you thank you I just
 
00:22:36.909 --> 00:22:36.919 align:start position:0%
have one question for you mind um
 
00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:39.080 align:start position:0%
currently what's the process for looking
 
00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:40.880 align:start position:0%
at all mitigation because I I live in
 
00:22:43.230 --> 00:22:43.240 align:start position:0%
Manchester I've seen you know
 
00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods around the airports get
 
00:22:46.789 --> 00:22:46.799 align:start position:0%
all new windows and HVAC systems I mean
 
00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:48.640 align:start position:0%
there's obviously something already in
 
00:22:51.269 --> 00:22:51.279 align:start position:0%
place there there was a program they
 
00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
called a noise noise abatement program
 
00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:56.840 align:start position:0%
and Manchester was certainly um a big um
 
00:22:59.310 --> 00:22:59.320 align:start position:0%
participant in that especially in the
 
00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
2000s um what we have is what they call
 
00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:04.960 align:start position:0%
a noise contour and it's based on the
 
00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
type of airplanes that fly in and out of
 
00:23:09.029 --> 00:23:09.039 align:start position:0%
that airport and what it creates is a
 
00:23:11.029 --> 00:23:11.039 align:start position:0%
contour and wherever that lies upon the
 
00:23:13.269 --> 00:23:13.279 align:start position:0%
ground was their determination on who
 
00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:16.240 align:start position:0%
gets what so if you were within a higher
 
00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:20.120 align:start position:0%
decibel you would get certain um work
 
00:23:22.549 --> 00:23:22.559 align:start position:0%
done on your house to help mitigate that
 
00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:24.240 align:start position:0%
and then as you work your way out from
 
00:23:26.789 --> 00:23:26.799 align:start position:0%
that Center you would get maybe
 
00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
something less and then and I do
 
00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
recognize there were some people that
 
00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:32.840 align:start position:0%
would say with a line cross my neighbor
 
00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:35.320 align:start position:0%
got it but I didn't and so but it it's
 
00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:38.200 align:start position:0%
based off those contour lines but who
 
00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:40.600 align:start position:0%
oversaw that that's my question that is
 
00:23:43.029 --> 00:23:43.039 align:start position:0%
the airport sponsor in this case I think
 
00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
we're talking is Manchester and would be
 
00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
the FAA would make that final
 
00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
determination on the funding for that
 
00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
thank you very much anybody else from
 
00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
the committee represent guys thank you
 
00:23:56.190 --> 00:23:56.200 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you ma'am so you said
 
00:23:58.430 --> 00:23:58.440 align:start position:0%
that we have 12 uh federally funded a
 
00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:00.400 align:start position:0%
airports and that they have to operate
 
00:24:02.269 --> 00:24:02.279 align:start position:0%
in the hours that are federally funded
 
00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:05.200 align:start position:0%
that's correct if we did something like
 
00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:07.360 align:start position:0%
a noise AB bment the restricted flight
 
00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:09.320 align:start position:0%
would that be overridden by the federal
 
00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:11.960 align:start position:0%
or would they stop funding that
 
00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:16.200 align:start position:0%
airport um funding is always could be an
 
00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:18.520 align:start position:0%
issue going forward but the bigger issue
 
00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:21.240 align:start position:0%
is going to be if they curtail those
 
00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:23.360 align:start position:0%
operations the federal government can
 
00:24:25.269 --> 00:24:25.279 align:start position:0%
come back in and say that we want our
 
00:24:27.310 --> 00:24:27.320 align:start position:0%
money back and they do it on a pration
 
00:24:31.029 --> 00:24:31.039 align:start position:0%
basis thank you ma'am anybody else
 
00:24:31.039 --> 00:24:33.029 align:start position:0%
basis thank you ma'am anybody else
represent

00:24:33.029 --> 00:24:33.039 align:start position:0%

00:24:35.789 --> 00:24:35.799 align:start position:0%
H thank you Mr chair uh thank you for

being here thank um I apologize up front
 
00:24:41.789 --> 00:24:41.799 align:start position:0%
I I'm not aware of your Committee of who
 
00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
you represent can you speak to uh your
 
00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
Bureau what it is you do and sure
 
00:24:50.830 --> 00:24:50.840 align:start position:0%
appreciate that um our Bureau um is a
 
00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:56.120 align:start position:0%
small Bureau of eight full-time we are
 
00:24:57.750 --> 00:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
pretty much everything for Aviation
 
00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:00.200 align:start position:0%
within the state we are the fa
 
00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
liaison all the funds federal funds that
 
00:25:05.149 --> 00:25:05.159 align:start position:0%
flow through to this to those airports
 
00:25:07.149 --> 00:25:07.159 align:start position:0%
go through our office and they call that
 
00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
a channel we're a channeling State um we
 
00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:11.720 align:start position:0%
are also a block rant state so for some
 
00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
of those smaller airports we act as the
 
00:25:16.909 --> 00:25:16.919 align:start position:0%
FAA for those airports in that funding
 
00:25:19.710 --> 00:25:19.720 align:start position:0%
so we do the planning programming um and
 
00:25:21.789 --> 00:25:21.799 align:start position:0%
we oversee the grants that go out to the
 
00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:23.480 align:start position:0%
airports for the engineering and
 
00:25:26.789 --> 00:25:26.799 align:start position:0%
development work um we do collect some
 
00:25:29.710 --> 00:25:29.720 align:start position:0%
Revenue through uh the aircraft
 
00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
registration program which is
 
00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:33.720 align:start position:0%
essentially like the DMV but for for
 
00:25:36.389 --> 00:25:36.399 align:start position:0%
airplanes uh we are respond to aircraft
 
00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:39.440 align:start position:0%
accidents and support the FAA and NTSB
 
00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:41.200 align:start position:0%
when those occur so we will have
 
00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:43.120 align:start position:0%
somebody an inspector on the ground for
 
00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:45.960 align:start position:0%
that um we currently many of you may see
 
00:25:47.669 --> 00:25:47.679 align:start position:0%
in the news we run the Alton Bay ice
 
00:25:51.149 --> 00:25:51.159 align:start position:0%
Runway um and that's anywhere from a
 
00:25:54.510 --> 00:25:54.520 align:start position:0%
week to 20 weeks 10 weeks
 
00:25:57.630 --> 00:25:57.640 align:start position:0%
um and anything else that relates to to
 
00:25:58.830 --> 00:25:58.840 align:start position:0%
um Aviation
 
00:26:01.470 --> 00:26:01.480 align:start position:0%
whether it's um Homeland Security
 
00:26:03.870 --> 00:26:03.880 align:start position:0%
Aviation assets those types of things
 
00:26:06.149 --> 00:26:06.159 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome repres
 
00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
SES thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:26:11.909 --> 00:26:11.919 align:start position:0%
taking my question um you did you
 
00:26:14.269 --> 00:26:14.279 align:start position:0%
referred to Freight operations as
 
00:26:16.990 --> 00:26:17.000 align:start position:0%
possibly being impacted I wondered how
 
00:26:21.029 --> 00:26:21.039 align:start position:0%
this bill would affect uh EAS uh funding
 
00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:24.360 align:start position:0%
for central air service funding from the
 
00:26:28.789 --> 00:26:28.799 align:start position:0%
feds thank you for the question uh
 
00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:30.360 align:start position:0%
the only the airport in the state that
 
00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
currently I believe gets AAS funding is
 
00:26:35.070 --> 00:26:35.080 align:start position:0%
Lebanon I don't know that they operate
 
00:26:37.669 --> 00:26:37.679 align:start position:0%
outside those hours Short of coming in
 
00:26:41.909 --> 00:26:41.919 align:start position:0%
um late you know not on time um I'd have
 
00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
to look that up to see whether they
 
00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:46.600 align:start position:0%
actually oper come in after
 
00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
midnight and this bill is just to
 
00:26:50.549 --> 00:26:50.559 align:start position:0%
establish a commission so anybody else
 
00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:51.440 align:start position:0%
from the
 
00:26:53.470 --> 00:26:53.480 align:start position:0%

committee
 
00:31:00.789 --> 00:31:00.799 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time today my name is
 
00:31:03.269 --> 00:31:03.279 align:start position:0%
Rich Nano and I represent Cheshire
 
00:31:05.549 --> 00:31:05.559 align:start position:0%
District 9 which includes the towns of
 
00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
elad Gilson Marlo and Stoddard I'm here
 
00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
to introduce House Bill 489 as the prime
 
00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:14.240 align:start position:0%
sponsor House Bill 489 is a
 
00:31:15.909 --> 00:31:15.919 align:start position:0%
straightforward necessary minor
 
00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
amendment to existing legislation which
 
00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
is RSA 266 colon 78- B Roman numeral
 
00:31:28.190 --> 00:31:28.200 align:start position:0%
3 uh to ensure that our emergency Merc
 
00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
responders have the necessary tools they
 
00:31:31.629 --> 00:31:31.639 align:start position:0%
need to do their job safely and
 
00:31:35.710 --> 00:31:35.720 align:start position:0%
effectively a few years ago RSA 266 78b
 
00:31:37.149 --> 00:31:37.159 align:start position:0%
was amended to allow a single
 
00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:39.240 align:start position:0%
rear-facing blue light on ambulances and
 
00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:41.720 align:start position:0%
fire trucks while well-intentioned and
 
00:31:43.549 --> 00:31:43.559 align:start position:0%
necessary that addition to the law
 
00:31:46.350 --> 00:31:46.360 align:start position:0%
inadvertently created an inconsistency
 
00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
one that HB 489 seeks to correct House
 
00:31:52.190 --> 00:31:52.200 align:start position:0%
Bill 489 ensures that all First
 
00:31:54.190 --> 00:31:54.200 align:start position:0%
Responders operating a vehicle during an
 
00:31:56.230 --> 00:31:56.240 align:start position:0%
emergency whether the vehicle is
 
00:31:59.830 --> 00:31:59.840 align:start position:0%
publicly or privately owned have clear
 
00:32:02.269 --> 00:32:02.279 align:start position:0%
and consistent visibility improving
 
00:32:04.430 --> 00:32:04.440 align:start position:0%
safety for both First Responders and the
 
00:32:07.669 --> 00:32:07.679 align:start position:0%
general public to be clear this bill
 
00:32:10.629 --> 00:32:10.639 align:start position:0%
costs the state and towns nothing
 
00:32:12.909 --> 00:32:12.919 align:start position:0%
volunteer emergency Personnel typically
 
00:32:15.269 --> 00:32:15.279 align:start position:0%
pay for their own emergency lights and
 
00:32:18.149 --> 00:32:18.159 align:start position:0%
this legislation only allows the option
 
00:32:20.509 --> 00:32:20.519 align:start position:0%
for a rear-facing blue light and does
 
00:32:22.990 --> 00:32:23.000 align:start position:0%
not mandate that anyone purchase and
 
00:32:26.789 --> 00:32:26.799 align:start position:0%
install one what H Bill H House Bill 489
 
00:32:28.629 --> 00:32:28.639 align:start position:0%
does is correct an over sight in the
 
00:32:32.269 --> 00:32:32.279 align:start position:0%
existing law supporting this bill means
 
00:32:34.509 --> 00:32:34.519 align:start position:0%
uh supporting our fire firefighters and
 
00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:36.760 align:start position:0%
Emergency Management workers and
 
00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:39.480 align:start position:0%
volunteers the very men and women we all
 
00:32:42.430 --> 00:32:42.440 align:start position:0%
rely on to respond in emergency
 
00:32:45.549 --> 00:32:45.559 align:start position:0%
situations visibility especially during
 
00:32:48.029 --> 00:32:48.039 align:start position:0%
emergencies matters especially on New
 
00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:50.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's roads where conditions can
 
00:32:52.990 --> 00:32:53.000 align:start position:0%
be unpredictable and I would add to the
 
00:32:54.870 --> 00:32:54.880 align:start position:0%
written testimony that that's especially
 
00:32:58.310 --> 00:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
true in rural parts of the state where I
 
00:33:00.149 --> 00:33:00.159 align:start position:0%
live you take a road like 123 and
 
00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
everybody has ever traversed 123 which
 
00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:06.240 align:start position:0%
I'm doing daily you have real issues if
 
00:33:08.029 --> 00:33:08.039 align:start position:0%
there's an accident or something on the
 
00:33:10.590 --> 00:33:10.600 align:start position:0%
roadway you come upon it around a Bend
 
00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:12.120 align:start position:0%
pretty uh
 
00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:16.240 align:start position:0%
suddenly H 489 is a simple Common Sense
 
00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:17.880 align:start position:0%
solution that ensures that emergency
 
00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
responders can be seen protected and
 
00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
able to do their jobs as safely as
 
00:33:24.190 --> 00:33:24.200 align:start position:0%
possible I urge this committee to
 
00:33:26.950 --> 00:33:26.960 align:start position:0%
support a recommendation of autop pass

it's getting harder and harder to
 
00:33:48.789 --> 00:33:48.799 align:start position:0%
attract Volunteers in our state and we
 
00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:51.200 align:start position:0%
need to do everything within our power
 
00:33:53.230 --> 00:33:53.240 align:start position:0%
to make sure that they have the
 
00:33:56.509 --> 00:33:56.519 align:start position:0%
necessary tools protection and uh other

for reading your testimony to us uh any
 
00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:37.320 align:start position:0%
representative Miller thank you Mr
 
00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you representative for
 
00:34:40.389 --> 00:34:40.399 align:start position:0%
your testimony um in reviewing the
 
00:34:43.990 --> 00:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
existing uh text of the legislation in
 
00:34:45.869 --> 00:34:45.879 align:start position:0%
advance of the session I note there's a
 
00:34:47.790 --> 00:34:47.800 align:start position:0%
section that says when the blue colored
 
00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:49.280 align:start position:0%
lights are installed on a private
 
00:34:51.669 --> 00:34:51.679 align:start position:0%
vehicle owned by or leased to a law
 
00:34:53.589 --> 00:34:53.599 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer such light shall be
 
00:34:55.149 --> 00:34:55.159 align:start position:0%
covered when the vehicle is being driven
 
00:34:57.069 --> 00:34:57.079 align:start position:0%
by someone other than a law enforcement
 
00:34:57.079 --> 00:34:58.390 align:start position:0%
by someone other than a law enforcement
officer

00:34:58.390 --> 00:34:58.400 align:start position:0%
officer
 
00:35:00.510 --> 00:35:00.520 align:start position:0%
uh in that this bill would allow a
 
00:35:01.950 --> 00:35:01.960 align:start position:0%
similar situation where these lights
 
00:35:03.630 --> 00:35:03.640 align:start position:0%
would be installed on a vehicle not
 
00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
owned by the city or state so it's a
 
00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
private vehicle but would be driven by
 
00:35:10.030 --> 00:35:10.040 align:start position:0%
not a law enforcement officer would you
 
00:35:12.030 --> 00:35:12.040 align:start position:0%
expect that they would also be covered
 
00:35:13.390 --> 00:35:13.400 align:start position:0%
when it's not being driven by the
 
00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:15.720 align:start position:0%
volunteer who might be using that or
 
00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
we'll just leave it turned off and
 
00:35:18.910 --> 00:35:18.920 align:start position:0%
that's probably sufficient well I think
 
00:35:21.109 --> 00:35:21.119 align:start position:0%
it could either be turned off I mean the
 
00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:23.440 align:start position:0%
fact that the lights there and uh you to
 
00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:26.240 align:start position:0%
be turned off or I think are you saying
 
00:35:27.950 --> 00:35:27.960 align:start position:0%
if the person is not involved in the
 
00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:30.470 align:start position:0%
if the person is not involved in the
emergency

00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:33.560 align:start position:0%
situation I my read of this is like if a
 
00:35:36.030 --> 00:35:36.040 align:start position:0%
police officer has this on a leased
 
00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
vehicle on their private car and their
 
00:35:40.109 --> 00:35:40.119 align:start position:0%
spouse is driving it it is supposed to
 
00:35:42.270 --> 00:35:42.280 align:start position:0%
be covered rather than visible I'm not
 
00:35:43.790 --> 00:35:43.800 align:start position:0%
sure that actually ever happens or as
 
00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
practical but that's what the law says
 
00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:48.040 align:start position:0%
and so I'm curious if that you think
 
00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
this would apply there as well yeah I I
 
00:35:52.510 --> 00:35:52.520 align:start position:0%
I think it would generally not be turned
 
00:35:55.950 --> 00:35:55.960 align:start position:0%
on okay fa so thank
 
00:35:57.990 --> 00:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
you any other questions from the
 
00:36:00.710 --> 00:36:00.720 align:start position:0%
committee represent thank you Mr
 
00:36:02.190 --> 00:36:02.200 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you representative for
 
00:36:04.470 --> 00:36:04.480 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh for clarification
 
00:36:07.150 --> 00:36:07.160 align:start position:0%
so why is it a blue light that's being
 
00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:08.680 align:start position:0%
requested not a red light I know there's
 
00:36:10.630 --> 00:36:10.640 align:start position:0%
already a red light in the existing law
 
00:36:15.270 --> 00:36:15.280 align:start position:0%
right uh is it 27 26678 C um so in your
 
00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
testimony here it says for firefighters
 
00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
EMS but so doesn't that already exist
 
00:36:21.910 --> 00:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
and what's the clarification on that
 
00:36:23.470 --> 00:36:23.480 align:start position:0%
well I think it doesn't what this is
 
00:36:27.230 --> 00:36:27.240 align:start position:0%
intended to do is to cover uh volunteers
 
00:36:29.589 --> 00:36:29.599 align:start position:0%
that AR necessarily covered under this
 
00:36:32.030 --> 00:36:32.040 align:start position:0%
uh legislation but I do have Mr km who
 
00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
is here with me that can probably uh
 
00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:36.200 align:start position:0%
answer that
 
00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
question more wait well you can either
 
00:36:42.349 --> 00:36:42.359 align:start position:0%
wait or I don't know what the procedure
 
00:36:44.910 --> 00:36:44.920 align:start position:0%
is if it helps a few years back we
 
00:36:47.950 --> 00:36:47.960 align:start position:0%
passed a law that enabled fire to use
 
00:36:50.349 --> 00:36:50.359 align:start position:0%
the blue light which was against what we
 
00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:52.240 align:start position:0%
had currently this is just adding
 
00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:54.400 align:start position:0%
volunteers it's really just anybody else
 
00:36:55.349 --> 00:36:55.359 align:start position:0%
from the
 
00:36:57.750 --> 00:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
committee it's just a very short
 
00:36:59.390 --> 00:36:59.400 align:start position:0%
addition if you look at the existing
 
00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:01.480 align:start position:0%
legislation and it I think it's pretty
 
00:37:03.109 --> 00:37:03.119 align:start position:0%
straightforward and I I believe
 
00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
basically it's a common sense U addition
 
00:37:08.309 --> 00:37:08.319 align:start position:0%
to the existing
 
00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
legislation anybody else being then
 
00:37:14.349 --> 00:37:14.359 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank
 
00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
you and with great
 
00:37:19.349 --> 00:37:19.359 align:start position:0%
fanfair chair recognizes Gordon KMP
 
00:37:21.349 --> 00:37:21.359 align:start position:0%
representing himself in support of the
 
00:37:32.710 --> 00:37:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:33.790 --> 00:37:33.800 align:start position:0%
morning chairman members of the
 
00:37:35.069 --> 00:37:35.079 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for your time and
 
00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:36.560 align:start position:0%
allowing me to testify before you this
 
00:37:38.309 --> 00:37:38.319 align:start position:0%
morning my name is Gordon Kemp I'm a
 
00:37:41.109 --> 00:37:41.119 align:start position:0%
selectman in alad uh licensed emergency
 
00:37:43.109 --> 00:37:43.119 align:start position:0%
medical responder member of Alid
 
00:37:45.150 --> 00:37:45.160 align:start position:0%
ambulance and a firefighter with Alid
 
00:37:49.109 --> 00:37:49.119 align:start position:0%
and aworth fire departments um I think
 
00:37:51.630 --> 00:37:51.640 align:start position:0%
representative Neno covered most
 
00:37:53.069 --> 00:37:53.079 align:start position:0%
everything I was going to say I don't
 
00:37:55.270 --> 00:37:55.280 align:start position:0%
want to take up more time so um I think
 
00:37:56.589 --> 00:37:56.599 align:start position:0%
what I'll do is just answer any
 
00:37:58.589 --> 00:37:58.599 align:start position:0%
questions if if you have
 
00:38:00.790 --> 00:38:00.800 align:start position:0%
any thank you very much sir any
 
00:38:02.309 --> 00:38:02.319 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
00:38:05.710 --> 00:38:05.720 align:start position:0%
committee representative St
 
00:38:08.430 --> 00:38:08.440 align:start position:0%
Clair thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
and I'm not trying to be smart about
 
00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
this or anything
 
00:38:15.309 --> 00:38:15.319 align:start position:0%
but you think that blue lights get more
 
00:38:16.829 --> 00:38:16.839 align:start position:0%
respect than red
 
00:38:19.589 --> 00:38:19.599 align:start position:0%
lights no sir I don't it's not about
 
00:38:22.109 --> 00:38:22.119 align:start position:0%
respect at all it's um when this
 
00:38:24.150 --> 00:38:24.160 align:start position:0%
legislation was amended in
 
00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
2015 it was there was testimony offered
 
00:38:29.190 --> 00:38:29.200 align:start position:0%
about this science behind blue lights
 
00:38:32.190 --> 00:38:32.200 align:start position:0%
cutting through inclement weather fog
 
00:38:34.150 --> 00:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
snow and things like that uh much better
 
00:38:35.790 --> 00:38:35.800 align:start position:0%
than red and also blue lights being
 
00:38:41.630 --> 00:38:41.640 align:start position:0%
better um at night um similarly uh the
 
00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
law enforcement was allowed you to start
 
00:38:45.910 --> 00:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
using red lights recently for you know
 
00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
the flip side of
 
00:38:51.950 --> 00:38:51.960 align:start position:0%
that thank you anybody else from the
 
00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:54.720 align:start position:0%
committee representative pondon thank
 
00:38:56.309 --> 00:38:56.319 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
00:38:59.069 --> 00:38:59.079 align:start position:0%
question um kind of along the same lines
 
00:39:02.470 --> 00:39:02.480 align:start position:0%
my concern is blue lights are inherently
 
00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
for law enforcement and I know this
 
00:39:07.230 --> 00:39:07.240 align:start position:0%
visibility issue but would you be
 
00:39:11.630 --> 00:39:11.640 align:start position:0%
amenable to uh red and and blue red and
 
00:39:14.430 --> 00:39:14.440 align:start position:0%
yellow for a higher visibility even read
 
00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
in and Amber you know a uh like a clear
 
00:39:21.150 --> 00:39:21.160 align:start position:0%
lens for for the visibility my concern
 
00:39:23.710 --> 00:39:23.720 align:start position:0%
is the public is
 
00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:28.040 align:start position:0%
inherently uh accustomed to being blue
 
00:39:30.829 --> 00:39:30.839 align:start position:0%
being there's law enforcement present
 
00:39:34.190 --> 00:39:34.200 align:start position:0%
not knowing if arms are are drawn or
 
00:39:38.990 --> 00:39:39.000 align:start position:0%
what the situation is whereas uh red is
 
00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
denotes fire ambulance uh and so on so I
 
00:39:47.790 --> 00:39:47.800 align:start position:0%
re I fully support the visibility issue
 
00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
uh just exclusively blue personally I uh
 
00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:53.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how I feel about that can
 
00:39:56.150 --> 00:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
you elaborate more on other color
 
00:39:58.510 --> 00:39:58.520 align:start position:0%
options instead of exclusive L
 
00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:02.640 align:start position:0%
blue so thank you for your question
 
00:40:05.829 --> 00:40:05.839 align:start position:0%
um so to be clear this is only adding a
 
00:40:07.829 --> 00:40:07.839 align:start position:0%
single rear-facing blue light that would
 
00:40:10.750 --> 00:40:10.760 align:start position:0%
be an addition to um red lights that are
 
00:40:13.790 --> 00:40:13.800 align:start position:0%
already in use um and it's my
 
00:40:15.630 --> 00:40:15.640 align:start position:0%
understanding the law requires 360
 
00:40:19.270 --> 00:40:19.280 align:start position:0%
degree visibility of emergency lights so
 
00:40:21.470 --> 00:40:21.480 align:start position:0%
both the sides in the front would be red
 
00:40:23.790 --> 00:40:23.800 align:start position:0%
and I believe you can use Amber as well
 
00:40:26.550 --> 00:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
it's only on the rear and a single light
 
00:40:29.190 --> 00:40:29.200 align:start position:0%
and you know you know no fire no
 
00:40:30.870 --> 00:40:30.880 align:start position:0%
volunteers are going to show up with you
 
00:40:33.589 --> 00:40:33.599 align:start position:0%
know a a full side or the whole rear or
 
00:40:36.150 --> 00:40:36.160 align:start position:0%
the whole front you know flashing blue
 
00:40:38.470 --> 00:40:38.480 align:start position:0%
it's just a single small light on the
 
00:40:41.109 --> 00:40:41.119 align:start position:0%
rear um to attract attention and cut
 
00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
through the Clutter and cut through um
 
00:40:45.790 --> 00:40:45.800 align:start position:0%
inclement weather uh it's it's the exact
 
00:40:47.349 --> 00:40:47.359 align:start position:0%
same reason why we do it on the fire
 
00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:49.560 align:start position:0%
trucks and ambulances currently those
 
00:40:51.710 --> 00:40:51.720 align:start position:0%
are all red and Amber and white and then
 
00:40:55.630 --> 00:40:55.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:58.309 --> 00:40:58.319 align:start position:0%
light for the question
 
00:41:01.790 --> 00:41:01.800 align:start position:0%
see thank you very much sir thank you uh
 
00:41:03.870 --> 00:41:03.880 align:start position:0%
next up chair recogniz is Matt Uchi
 
00:41:05.710 --> 00:41:05.720 align:start position:0%
represented New Hampshire State
 
00:41:09.910 --> 00:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
Police in opposition to the bill welcome
 
00:41:12.950 --> 00:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
sir morning Mr chair morning committee
 
00:41:16.190 --> 00:41:16.200 align:start position:0%
members uh my name is m mitui uh I'm
 
00:41:17.910 --> 00:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
here in opposition of this bill on
 
00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
behalf of the New Hampshire State
 
00:41:22.430 --> 00:41:22.440 align:start position:0%
Police um we view this as a public
 
00:41:24.390 --> 00:41:24.400 align:start position:0%
safety concern the primary reason for
 
00:41:25.950 --> 00:41:25.960 align:start position:0%
restricting blue lights to emergency
 
00:41:27.950 --> 00:41:27.960 align:start position:0%
vehicles is to Main maintain Public
 
00:41:30.150 --> 00:41:30.160 align:start position:0%
Safety and Trust increasing the amount
 
00:41:32.270 --> 00:41:32.280 align:start position:0%
of blue lights on our roadways will lead
 
00:41:34.990 --> 00:41:35.000 align:start position:0%
to misidentification and confusion from
 
00:41:38.069 --> 00:41:38.079 align:start position:0%
the public historically blue lights uh
 
00:41:39.870 --> 00:41:39.880 align:start position:0%
have been reserved for law enforcement
 
00:41:41.710 --> 00:41:41.720 align:start position:0%
and first responder
 
00:41:44.430 --> 00:41:44.440 align:start position:0%
vehicles uh although there are some fire
 
00:41:46.190 --> 00:41:46.200 align:start position:0%
trucks and ambulances with a rear-facing
 
00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
blue light there is no confusion as to
 
00:41:50.030 --> 00:41:50.040 align:start position:0%
what those vehicles
 
00:41:53.230 --> 00:41:53.240 align:start position:0%
are um blue lights on private Vehicles
 
00:41:55.589 --> 00:41:55.599 align:start position:0%
will lead to confusion and desensitize
 
00:41:58.150 --> 00:41:58.160 align:start position:0%
the public to blue lights
 
00:42:00.510 --> 00:42:00.520 align:start position:0%
so with that I'll GL to answer any
 
00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
questions thank you sir questions from
 
00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:04.270 align:start position:0%
questions thank you sir questions from
the

00:42:04.270 --> 00:42:04.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:42:06.829 --> 00:42:06.839 align:start position:0%
committee seeing
 
00:42:10.190 --> 00:42:10.200 align:start position:0%
n representative Miller
 
00:42:13.550 --> 00:42:13.560 align:start position:0%
sorry uh thank thank you Mr chairman and
 
00:42:16.069 --> 00:42:16.079 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking our questions um
 
00:42:18.190 --> 00:42:18.200 align:start position:0%
the the vehicles that these would be on
 
00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
would be Vehicles responding to
 
00:42:23.589 --> 00:42:23.599 align:start position:0%
emergency situations and albeit not
 
00:42:25.430 --> 00:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
structured as an emergency vehicle
 
00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
they're still performing that service
 
00:42:32.670 --> 00:42:32.680 align:start position:0%
and so I'm curious the the people doing
 
00:42:35.150 --> 00:42:35.160 align:start position:0%
that arguably deserve the same
 
00:42:38.309 --> 00:42:38.319 align:start position:0%
protection um that the light visibility
 
00:42:42.190 --> 00:42:42.200 align:start position:0%
offers where what is the what is the net
 
00:42:44.309 --> 00:42:44.319 align:start position:0%
negative impact that you see more
 
00:42:46.230 --> 00:42:46.240 align:start position:0%
broadly of this because these are
 
00:42:48.109 --> 00:42:48.119 align:start position:0%
emergency responders is it just because
 
00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
different types of vehicles are used
 
00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
rather than the people yes thank you for
 
00:42:55.589 --> 00:42:55.599 align:start position:0%
the question um I think it just
 
00:42:57.750 --> 00:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
generally desensitizes the public to
 
00:43:00.150 --> 00:43:00.160 align:start position:0%
Blue Lights um currently when people see
 
00:43:02.230 --> 00:43:02.240 align:start position:0%
blue lights
 
00:43:04.990 --> 00:43:05.000 align:start position:0%
they they view that as law enforcement
 
00:43:06.990 --> 00:43:07.000 align:start position:0%
and although they're on fire trucks and
 
00:43:09.549 --> 00:43:09.559 align:start position:0%
ambulances those are very distinct
 
00:43:10.910 --> 00:43:10.920 align:start position:0%
vehicles that you know what those
 
00:43:14.190 --> 00:43:14.200 align:start position:0%
vehicles are if you put them on any
 
00:43:16.109 --> 00:43:16.119 align:start position:0%
vehicle that's out there I think over
 
00:43:18.030 --> 00:43:18.040 align:start position:0%
time it's just going to desensitize the
 
00:43:20.710 --> 00:43:20.720 align:start position:0%
public to what those those vehicle those
 
00:43:23.870 --> 00:43:23.880 align:start position:0%
vehicles are um it's just one
 
00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:25.750 align:start position:0%
vehicles are um it's just one
rear-facing

00:43:25.750 --> 00:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
rear-facing
 
00:43:28.790 --> 00:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
um blue light typically when they
 
00:43:33.390 --> 00:43:33.400 align:start position:0%
respond to scenes there's going to be
 
00:43:35.030 --> 00:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
fire trucks
 
00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
ambulances police cars so there'll be
 
00:43:40.069 --> 00:43:40.079 align:start position:0%
plenty of other vehicles that are there
 
00:43:43.069 --> 00:43:43.079 align:start position:0%
that will have an assortment of Lights
 
00:43:47.109 --> 00:43:47.119 align:start position:0%
blue and red um I think just having a
 
00:43:51.230 --> 00:43:51.240 align:start position:0%
rear-facing blue light on any vehicle um
 
00:43:53.230 --> 00:43:53.240 align:start position:0%
it'll be hundreds of vehicles throughout
 
00:43:55.430 --> 00:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
the state I think it will desensitize
 
00:43:59.750 --> 00:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:02.069 --> 00:44:02.079 align:start position:0%
just for clarity can
 
00:44:04.589 --> 00:44:04.599 align:start position:0%
volunteer um fire departments put a
 
00:44:06.150 --> 00:44:06.160 align:start position:0%
single blue light on the back of their
 
00:44:10.990 --> 00:44:11.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:13.790 --> 00:44:13.800 align:start position:0%

hearing uh a few minutes to reset um
 
00:44:56.030 --> 00:44:56.040 align:start position:0%

yeah

00:45:25.950 --> 00:45:25.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:02.829 --> 00:46:02.839 align:start position:0%

00:47:49.349 --> 00:47:49.359 align:start position:0%
recognizes Bob Scully from New Hampshire
 
00:47:51.950 --> 00:47:51.960 align:start position:0%
Motor Transport Association doesn't
 
00:47:53.309 --> 00:47:53.319 align:start position:0%
appear to be taking a position on the
 
00:47:59.349 --> 00:47:59.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:00.829 --> 00:48:00.839 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman members of the
 
00:48:02.349 --> 00:48:02.359 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is Bob
 
00:48:03.990 --> 00:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
Scully representing New Hampshire Motor
 
00:48:07.470 --> 00:48:07.480 align:start position:0%
Transport Association um initially I was
 
00:48:09.230 --> 00:48:09.240 align:start position:0%
going to be opposing this bill there's
 
00:48:12.030 --> 00:48:12.040 align:start position:0%
been some confusion on our part as to
 
00:48:14.030 --> 00:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
where these equipment inspectors would
 
00:48:17.630 --> 00:48:17.640 align:start position:0%
be going to do their work um our history
 
00:48:20.150 --> 00:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
with civilian employees in the on the
 
00:48:22.670 --> 00:48:22.680 align:start position:0%
commercial truck side has not been good
 
00:48:24.670 --> 00:48:24.680 align:start position:0%
particularly when it applies to the uh
 
00:48:28.150 --> 00:48:28.160 align:start position:0%
CDL application process I have been told
 
00:48:30.589 --> 00:48:30.599 align:start position:0%
that these inspectors would not be going
 
00:48:33.190 --> 00:48:33.200 align:start position:0%
to do inspections in the commercial
 
00:48:35.670 --> 00:48:35.680 align:start position:0%
Motor Vehicle area if that's true we
 
00:48:39.190 --> 00:48:39.200 align:start position:0%
don't have a position with this bill um
 
00:48:40.910 --> 00:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
but if it was to be true then I would be
 
00:48:42.829 --> 00:48:42.839 align:start position:0%
opposing this strongly because we had a
 
00:48:45.510 --> 00:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
lot of problems with that um we have a
 
00:48:47.990 --> 00:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
great relationship with the state police
 
00:48:50.270 --> 00:48:50.280 align:start position:0%
we'd prefer th those employees there
 
00:48:51.630 --> 00:48:51.640 align:start position:0%
because they understand what they're
 
00:48:54.990 --> 00:48:55.000 align:start position:0%
doing okay and our folks are used to
 
00:48:57.230 --> 00:48:57.240 align:start position:0%
them and know what they're talking about
 
00:48:59.670 --> 00:48:59.680 align:start position:0%
so um at least on the truck side as long
 
00:49:01.549 --> 00:49:01.559 align:start position:0%
as they're not going there then we don't
 
00:49:03.069 --> 00:49:03.079 align:start position:0%
have position on this bill for some
 
00:49:04.750 --> 00:49:04.760 align:start position:0%
reason this was to more for change than
 
00:49:07.109 --> 00:49:07.119 align:start position:0%
we would oppose it thank you Mr chair
 
00:49:09.589 --> 00:49:09.599 align:start position:0%
thank you sir take any questions any
 
00:49:11.789 --> 00:49:11.799 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee seeing none

00:49:26.030 --> 00:49:26.040 align:start position:0%
sir good morning chairman and members of
 
00:49:28.549 --> 00:49:28.559 align:start position:0%
the committee I just want to clarify
 
00:49:31.670 --> 00:49:31.680 align:start position:0%
this the the title is certainly um a
 
00:49:34.270 --> 00:49:34.280 align:start position:0%
little confusing this this is two
 
00:49:38.190 --> 00:49:38.200 align:start position:0%
separate um things in one bill so the
 
00:49:41.349 --> 00:49:41.359 align:start position:0%
first one which is under 2661
 
00:49:45.150 --> 00:49:45.160 align:start position:0%
a talks about adding the language or
 
00:49:47.870 --> 00:49:47.880 align:start position:0%
adding the term automotive equipment
 
00:49:50.109 --> 00:49:50.119 align:start position:0%
inspector uh as an
 
00:49:52.589 --> 00:49:52.599 align:start position:0%
authorized um person
 
00:49:55.990 --> 00:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
to help enforce our state's motor
 
00:49:58.549 --> 00:49:58.559 align:start position:0%
vehicle inspector laws and rules the
 
00:50:01.670 --> 00:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
second part of this is adding two terms
 
00:50:06.150 --> 00:50:06.160 align:start position:0%
to a completely separate set of rsas 266
 
00:50:08.349 --> 00:50:08.359 align:start position:0%
72a which is our Motor Carrier
 
00:50:11.109 --> 00:50:11.119 align:start position:0%
enforcement uh section and in that
 
00:50:14.430 --> 00:50:14.440 align:start position:0%
section the the M carrier section it
 
00:50:19.309 --> 00:50:19.319 align:start position:0%
adds two terms to paragraph D which are
 
00:50:22.030 --> 00:50:22.040 align:start position:0%
new entrance safety audit and compliance
 
00:50:26.309 --> 00:50:26.319 align:start position:0%
review and in regards to this we get
 
00:50:28.150 --> 00:50:28.160 align:start position:0%
audited by the Federal Motor Carrier
 
00:50:30.510 --> 00:50:30.520 align:start position:0%
safety administration and one of the
 
00:50:33.870 --> 00:50:33.880 align:start position:0%
findings that they had in regards to our
 
00:50:37.030 --> 00:50:37.040 align:start position:0%
Motor Carrier enforcement program was
 
00:50:39.430 --> 00:50:39.440 align:start position:0%
what they deemed right of entry and in
 
00:50:44.470 --> 00:50:44.480 align:start position:0%
the body of 26672 a sub paragraph D it
 
00:50:47.109 --> 00:50:47.119 align:start position:0%
allows anybody that's certified to
 
00:50:49.910 --> 00:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
conduct commercial vehicle
 
00:50:52.309 --> 00:50:52.319 align:start position:0%
inspections allows them or gives them
 
00:50:54.829 --> 00:50:54.839 align:start position:0%
permission to enter a motor carrier's
 
00:50:56.710 --> 00:50:56.720 align:start position:0%
primary place of business during
 
00:50:59.750 --> 00:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
business hours to examine business
 
00:51:02.829 --> 00:51:02.839 align:start position:0%
records and conduct an investigation the
 
00:51:05.390 --> 00:51:05.400 align:start position:0%
Federal Motor Carrier uh Administration
 
00:51:07.990 --> 00:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
asked us to go even further and to
 
00:51:11.549 --> 00:51:11.559 align:start position:0%
clarify that somebody could enter
 
00:51:12.950 --> 00:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
somebody that's certified to conduct
 
00:51:15.030 --> 00:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
truck inspections can
 
00:51:17.549 --> 00:51:17.559 align:start position:0%
enter the motor carrier's primary place
 
00:51:19.309 --> 00:51:19.319 align:start position:0%
of business during business hours to
 
00:51:21.589 --> 00:51:21.599 align:start position:0%
examine records and to perform a new
 
00:51:25.270 --> 00:51:25.280 align:start position:0%
entrance safety audit Andor compliance
 
00:51:27.109 --> 00:51:27.119 align:start position:0%
review um
 
00:51:29.309 --> 00:51:29.319 align:start position:0%
they're both investigations and for
 
00:51:30.870 --> 00:51:30.880 align:start position:0%
whatever reason feder Motor Carrier
 
00:51:33.270 --> 00:51:33.280 align:start position:0%
asked us to include those two terms
 
00:51:34.829 --> 00:51:34.839 align:start position:0%
because they're two
 
00:51:37.829 --> 00:51:37.839 align:start position:0%
specific uh activities that we do on
 
00:51:40.750 --> 00:51:40.760 align:start position:0%
behalf of Federal Motor Carrier so again
 
00:51:43.950 --> 00:51:43.960 align:start position:0%
the the title and the analysis um not
 
00:51:46.549 --> 00:51:46.559 align:start position:0%
100% correct and I just wanted to make
 
00:51:48.430 --> 00:51:48.440 align:start position:0%
sure that everybody here was aware that
 
00:51:50.910 --> 00:51:50.920 align:start position:0%
they're two separate sections of
 
00:51:54.150 --> 00:51:54.160 align:start position:0%
266 and there will be no civilians or no
 
00:51:55.789 --> 00:51:55.799 align:start position:0%
automotive equipment inspectors
 
00:51:58.470 --> 00:51:58.480 align:start position:0%
conducting commercial motor vehicle
 
00:52:00.150 --> 00:52:00.160 align:start position:0%
inspections and I will take any
 
00:52:01.589 --> 00:52:01.599 align:start position:0%
questions if there are any thank you
 
00:52:02.789 --> 00:52:02.799 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for that actually I have
 
00:52:05.270 --> 00:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
to I'm a little confused uh on the first
 
00:52:07.630 --> 00:52:07.640 align:start position:0%
section in terms of automotive equipment
 
00:52:09.750 --> 00:52:09.760 align:start position:0%
inspectors I thought we were you were
 
00:52:13.309 --> 00:52:13.319 align:start position:0%
already doing that we are this this just
 
00:52:16.589 --> 00:52:16.599 align:start position:0%
adds that title into the section as an
 
00:52:19.069 --> 00:52:19.079 align:start position:0%
authorized person to do it so how were
 
00:52:20.630 --> 00:52:20.640 align:start position:0%
you doing it previously without
 
00:52:22.510 --> 00:52:22.520 align:start position:0%
something in statute because I have to
 
00:52:24.109 --> 00:52:24.119 align:start position:0%
be honest with you and I'm I'm asking
 
00:52:27.270 --> 00:52:27.280 align:start position:0%
this because I have heard nothing good
 
00:52:29.230 --> 00:52:29.240 align:start position:0%
about anybody other than State Police
 
00:52:31.349 --> 00:52:31.359 align:start position:0%
monitoring the inspection stations they
 
00:52:33.589 --> 00:52:33.599 align:start position:0%
all walk around with Napoleon attitudes
 
00:52:36.270 --> 00:52:36.280 align:start position:0%
so how are you doing it
 
00:52:45.470 --> 00:52:45.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:49.349 --> 00:52:49.359 align:start position:0%
um this adds basically it's it's adding
 
00:52:50.910 --> 00:52:50.920 align:start position:0%
automotive equipment inspector it's one
 
00:52:54.470 --> 00:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
of our civilian employees that's
 
00:52:56.030 --> 00:52:56.040 align:start position:0%
authorized by the director Bo of
 
00:52:57.990 --> 00:52:58.000 align:start position:0%
vehicles to do
 
00:53:00.390 --> 00:53:00.400 align:start position:0%
this if that if that makes sense to you
 
00:53:03.630 --> 00:53:03.640 align:start position:0%
sir kind of I I'll follow up uh my
 
00:53:05.670 --> 00:53:05.680 align:start position:0%
second question on this was just to
 
00:53:09.789 --> 00:53:09.799 align:start position:0%
follow up with u Mr Scully um safe to
 
00:53:13.270 --> 00:53:13.280 align:start position:0%
say that sub paragraph D La enforcement
 
00:53:14.910 --> 00:53:14.920 align:start position:0%
agent certified to conduct truck
 
00:53:16.950 --> 00:53:16.960 align:start position:0%
inspections that means it's somebody
 
00:53:19.630 --> 00:53:19.640 align:start position:0%
from law enforcement correct period
 
00:53:21.510 --> 00:53:21.520 align:start position:0%
correct it and they would have to have
 
00:53:23.470 --> 00:53:23.480 align:start position:0%
been trained to do uh commercial vehicle
 
00:53:26.109 --> 00:53:26.119 align:start position:0%
inspectors which is only uh State Police
 
00:53:28.990 --> 00:53:29.000 align:start position:0%
in in the state all right so it's not an
 
00:53:31.430 --> 00:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
equipment inspector authorized by law
 
00:53:33.349 --> 00:53:33.359 align:start position:0%
enforcement no uh not at all two
 
00:53:34.870 --> 00:53:34.880 align:start position:0%
completely different things however they
 
00:53:36.030 --> 00:53:36.040 align:start position:0%
ended up in the same bill just looking
 
00:53:37.309 --> 00:53:37.319 align:start position:0%
for some clarity thank you very much
 
00:53:39.390 --> 00:53:39.400 align:start position:0%
thank you anybody else from the
 
00:53:42.390 --> 00:53:42.400 align:start position:0%
committee represent gski thank you Mr
 
00:53:43.630 --> 00:53:43.640 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you Colonel for
 
00:53:45.870 --> 00:53:45.880 align:start position:0%
taking my question can you El elaborate
 
00:53:47.349 --> 00:53:47.359 align:start position:0%
a little bit more what's the difference
 
00:53:49.510 --> 00:53:49.520 align:start position:0%
between a compliance review and a new
 
00:53:51.910 --> 00:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
entrance safety audit uh thank you for
 
00:53:53.309 --> 00:53:53.319 align:start position:0%
the question the new entrance safety
 
00:53:56.750 --> 00:53:56.760 align:start position:0%
audit is for a motor carrier that has re
 
00:53:59.549 --> 00:53:59.559 align:start position:0%
received a do number within the last 16
 
00:54:03.030 --> 00:54:03.040 align:start position:0%
months basically a new carrier and the
 
00:54:06.190 --> 00:54:06.200 align:start position:0%
the new entrance safety audit um as I
 
00:54:08.710 --> 00:54:08.720 align:start position:0%
call it it's the the warm and fuzzy uh
 
00:54:10.670 --> 00:54:10.680 align:start position:0%
side of what we do uh there's no
 
00:54:12.670 --> 00:54:12.680 align:start position:0%
enforcement action taken by us if we
 
00:54:15.990 --> 00:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
find deficiencies a compliance review is
 
00:54:17.950 --> 00:54:17.960 align:start position:0%
going in and actually looking for
 
00:54:19.870 --> 00:54:19.880 align:start position:0%
deficiencies or violations of either
 
00:54:23.030 --> 00:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
state law or Federal
 
00:54:26.870 --> 00:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
Regulation sure anybody else repres
 
00:54:29.030 --> 00:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
London thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
00:54:31.309 --> 00:54:31.319 align:start position:0%
taking my question so the way I
 
00:54:33.349 --> 00:54:33.359 align:start position:0%
understand this even though it's not
 
00:54:35.190 --> 00:54:35.200 align:start position:0%
mentioned in the body of the
 
00:54:37.270 --> 00:54:37.280 align:start position:0%
legislation this would authorize
 
00:54:39.630 --> 00:54:39.640 align:start position:0%
civilian Automotive
 
00:54:39.640 --> 00:54:41.349 align:start position:0%
civilian Automotive
inspectors

00:54:41.349 --> 00:54:41.359 align:start position:0%
inspectors
 
00:54:46.670 --> 00:54:46.680 align:start position:0%
uh in the rsas as it's in the body
 
00:54:50.190 --> 00:54:50.200 align:start position:0%
now my understanding is that they would
 
00:54:52.789 --> 00:54:52.799 align:start position:0%
only um the automotive equipment
 
00:54:57.270 --> 00:54:57.280 align:start position:0%
inspectors would only be um citing
 
00:55:00.309 --> 00:55:00.319 align:start position:0%
violations of our administrative rules
 
00:55:03.829 --> 00:55:03.839 align:start position:0%
if their if through the course of
 
00:55:06.589 --> 00:55:06.599 align:start position:0%
their working or investigations or
 
00:55:08.630 --> 00:55:08.640 align:start position:0%
monitoring uh either car dealers or
 
00:55:10.870 --> 00:55:10.880 align:start position:0%
inspection stations if they find a
 
00:55:13.150 --> 00:55:13.160 align:start position:0%
violation of law it gets turned over to
 
00:55:15.870 --> 00:55:15.880 align:start position:0%
one of our Troopers so they will not
 
00:55:17.789 --> 00:55:17.799 align:start position:0%
they may recognize a violation of state
 
00:55:20.670 --> 00:55:20.680 align:start position:0%
law but it it is then turned over uh to
 
00:55:21.990 --> 00:55:22.000 align:start position:0%
somebody from law enforcement to
 
00:55:25.470 --> 00:55:25.480 align:start position:0%

you Mr chairman for the record I am
 
01:04:26.109 --> 01:04:26.119 align:start position:0%
Erica Leon uh represent pres ative for
 
01:04:28.789 --> 01:04:28.799 align:start position:0%
the town of dairy which is Rockingham 13
 
01:04:30.950 --> 01:04:30.960 align:start position:0%
and this bill seeks to repeal language
 
01:04:32.670 --> 01:04:32.680 align:start position:0%
that was passed by this committee last
 
01:04:34.670 --> 01:04:34.680 align:start position:0%
year in what I like to call the right to
 
01:04:38.750 --> 01:04:38.760 align:start position:0%
Mo section um prior to passing that bill
 
01:04:40.470 --> 01:04:40.480 align:start position:0%
if you had your license suspended for
 
01:04:42.230 --> 01:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
doing bad things like driving under the
 
01:04:44.549 --> 01:04:44.559 align:start position:0%
influence and you drove a riding lawn
 
01:04:46.950 --> 01:04:46.960 align:start position:0%
mower in the state you were subject to
 
01:04:50.269 --> 01:04:50.279 align:start position:0%
seven days in jail because the law
 
01:04:52.069 --> 01:04:52.079 align:start position:0%
previously didn't differentiate between
 
01:04:53.950 --> 01:04:53.960 align:start position:0%
driving anywhere in the state and
 
01:04:56.990 --> 01:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
driving on away this specific language
 
01:04:58.829 --> 01:04:58.839 align:start position:0%
that's being removed was written with
 
01:05:00.390 --> 01:05:00.400 align:start position:0%
the intention that if you don't know
 
01:05:01.990 --> 01:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
where the actual legal edge of your
 
01:05:03.990 --> 01:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
property is and your lawn goes for feet
 
01:05:06.510 --> 01:05:06.520 align:start position:0%
further you won't risk spending seven
 
01:05:08.630 --> 01:05:08.640 align:start position:0%
nights in jail for mowing up to the edge
 
01:05:11.230 --> 01:05:11.240 align:start position:0%
of your grass um as we worked through
 
01:05:12.789 --> 01:05:12.799 align:start position:0%
with us and I worked on this bill with
 
01:05:14.230 --> 01:05:14.240 align:start position:0%
the Department of Motor Vehicles they
 
01:05:15.789 --> 01:05:15.799 align:start position:0%
didn't see any problems with the
 
01:05:17.630 --> 01:05:17.640 align:start position:0%
language as it's written however
 
01:05:20.510 --> 01:05:20.520 align:start position:0%
speaking to um speaking prior to this
 
01:05:22.269 --> 01:05:22.279 align:start position:0%
meeting it sounds that this could be
 
01:05:24.510 --> 01:05:24.520 align:start position:0%
interpreted that somebody could drive um
 
01:05:27.470 --> 01:05:27.480 align:start position:0%
in a demolition derby down the median of
 
01:05:30.950 --> 01:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
i93 uh without any charges and without
 
01:05:32.829 --> 01:05:32.839 align:start position:0%
any problems for them driving that way
 
01:05:34.950 --> 01:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
with a suspended license that was never
 
01:05:37.990 --> 01:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
my intention of the language and um I
 
01:05:40.029 --> 01:05:40.039 align:start position:0%
I'm actually going to look to work with
 
01:05:42.109 --> 01:05:42.119 align:start position:0%
both the Department of Justice and with
 
01:05:44.269 --> 01:05:44.279 align:start position:0%
the Department of Transportation to
 
01:05:46.349 --> 01:05:46.359 align:start position:0%
figure out how we can make the language
 
01:05:50.349 --> 01:05:50.359 align:start position:0%
clear so that you can mow up to the edge
 
01:05:52.950 --> 01:05:52.960 align:start position:0%
of your lawn even if that is not not
 
01:05:55.309 --> 01:05:55.319 align:start position:0%
technically your property or perhaps
 
01:05:56.870 --> 01:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
more importantly the property that you
 
01:05:59.710 --> 01:05:59.720 align:start position:0%
were mowing as a landscaper while not
 
01:06:01.470 --> 01:06:01.480 align:start position:0%
allowing demolition derbies in this
 
01:06:01.480 --> 01:06:03.910 align:start position:0%
allowing demolition derbies in this
Center

01:06:03.910 --> 01:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:05.910 --> 01:06:05.920 align:start position:0%
median thank you representative any
 
01:06:07.549 --> 01:06:07.559 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
01:06:09.630 --> 01:06:09.640 align:start position:0%
representative Hill thank you Mr
 
01:06:10.910 --> 01:06:10.920 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
01:06:13.950 --> 01:06:13.960 align:start position:0%
question representative uh is this
 
01:06:16.549 --> 01:06:16.559 align:start position:0%
strictly about mowing or is it uh is
 
01:06:19.230 --> 01:06:19.240 align:start position:0%
that euphemistically used uh thank you
 
01:06:21.269 --> 01:06:21.279 align:start position:0%
for the question um so this was actually
 
01:06:23.309 --> 01:06:23.319 align:start position:0%
the most challenging section of the law
 
01:06:25.710 --> 01:06:25.720 align:start position:0%
as we put it together because the
 
01:06:27.510 --> 01:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
largest time when you would be operating
 
01:06:28.990 --> 01:06:29.000 align:start position:0%
what is considered a motor vehicle in
 
01:06:30.390 --> 01:06:30.400 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire with a
 
01:06:31.829 --> 01:06:31.839 align:start position:0%
suspended license would be mowing your
 
01:06:33.390 --> 01:06:33.400 align:start position:0%
lawn so that your spouse doesn't have to
 
01:06:35.150 --> 01:06:35.160 align:start position:0%
do that after you're doing errands
 
01:06:37.309 --> 01:06:37.319 align:start position:0%
picking up the kids driving you where
 
01:06:38.789 --> 01:06:38.799 align:start position:0%
you need to go and then they have to
 
01:06:41.109 --> 01:06:41.119 align:start position:0%
come home and mow um that was one of the
 
01:06:43.990 --> 01:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
large intentions of the bill previously
 
01:06:46.069 --> 01:06:46.079 align:start position:0%
uh there was some concern that this that
 
01:06:47.630 --> 01:06:47.640 align:start position:0%
this language that they're addressing
 
01:06:48.829 --> 01:06:48.839 align:start position:0%
could mean that somebody could just
 
01:06:51.549 --> 01:06:51.559 align:start position:0%
drive right on the edge of the property
 
01:06:53.950 --> 01:06:53.960 align:start position:0%
uh which was never my intention honestly
 
01:06:55.549 --> 01:06:55.559 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't be you might be oper
 
01:06:57.630 --> 01:06:57.640 align:start position:0%
creating a tractor on the edge because
 
01:06:59.710 --> 01:06:59.720 align:start position:0%
you might be using that or an ATV in
 
01:07:01.990 --> 01:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
order to take your driveway and scrap
 
01:07:03.390 --> 01:07:03.400 align:start position:0%
back although even that makes me a
 
01:07:05.230 --> 01:07:05.240 align:start position:0%
little nervous if you're on a pave
 
01:07:07.230 --> 01:07:07.240 align:start position:0%
service surface I'm a lot more nervous
 
01:07:09.150 --> 01:07:09.160 align:start position:0%
about that and enabling that in
 
01:07:11.390 --> 01:07:11.400 align:start position:0%
legislation than I am about making sure
 
01:07:13.269 --> 01:07:13.279 align:start position:0%
that if you were mowing your property or
 
01:07:15.430 --> 01:07:15.440 align:start position:0%
the property you're hired to mow um you
 
01:07:17.789 --> 01:07:17.799 align:start position:0%
aren't risking a week in jail um the
 
01:07:19.230 --> 01:07:19.240 align:start position:0%
intention is mowing but I also don't
 
01:07:22.269 --> 01:07:22.279 align:start position:0%
want to write it so narrowly that if
 
01:07:24.349 --> 01:07:24.359 align:start position:0%
somebody I I just don't want to write it
 
01:07:25.750 --> 01:07:25.760 align:start position:0%
so narrowly that we have more problems
 
01:07:28.109 --> 01:07:28.119 align:start position:0%
and need to come back in the
 
01:07:28.119 --> 01:07:29.950 align:start position:0%
and need to come back in the
future

01:07:29.950 --> 01:07:29.960 align:start position:0%
future
 
01:07:32.829 --> 01:07:32.839 align:start position:0%
followup thank you
 
01:07:37.990 --> 01:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
um is it is it your belief that um it's
 
01:07:40.430 --> 01:07:40.440 align:start position:0%
the government that's going to question
 
01:07:43.069 --> 01:07:43.079 align:start position:0%
where you're mowing or is it a neighbor
 
01:07:46.430 --> 01:07:46.440 align:start position:0%
or how how did that work I I forget
 
01:07:48.630 --> 01:07:48.640 align:start position:0%
actually thank you so the law is
 
01:07:51.150 --> 01:07:51.160 align:start position:0%
currently well the law was on the books
 
01:07:52.950 --> 01:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
that you could spend you know that you
 
01:07:55.710 --> 01:07:55.720 align:start position:0%
could get an enhanced um ticket for
 
01:07:57.549 --> 01:07:57.559 align:start position:0%
driving on a suspend license when mowing
 
01:07:59.269 --> 01:07:59.279 align:start position:0%
or operating a tractor on your own
 
01:08:02.069 --> 01:08:02.079 align:start position:0%
property or property or even hired um
 
01:08:03.510 --> 01:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
the first time it was introduced the
 
01:08:04.990 --> 01:08:05.000 align:start position:0%
bill was killed because nobody had been
 
01:08:07.589 --> 01:08:07.599 align:start position:0%
arrested for it but just because nobody
 
01:08:10.630 --> 01:08:10.640 align:start position:0%
has actually done the time for a crime
 
01:08:12.109 --> 01:08:12.119 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that it should be on the
 
01:08:15.190 --> 01:08:15.200 align:start position:0%
books um right now I actually had the
 
01:08:16.910 --> 01:08:16.920 align:start position:0%
police called on me for cutting down a
 
01:08:18.870 --> 01:08:18.880 align:start position:0%
tree that was too that was close to the
 
01:08:20.550 --> 01:08:20.560 align:start position:0%
road and somebody was worried that we
 
01:08:22.149 --> 01:08:22.159 align:start position:0%
weren't going to do it in a responsible
 
01:08:24.470 --> 01:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
manner um there's absolutely the issue
 
01:08:26.510 --> 01:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
of neighbors have ing on neighbors and
 
01:08:29.110 --> 01:08:29.120 align:start position:0%
causing headaches and causing problems
 
01:08:32.269 --> 01:08:32.279 align:start position:0%
um so there's no reason to leave
 
01:08:34.430 --> 01:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
literally a gray area between somebody's
 
01:08:36.430 --> 01:08:36.440 align:start position:0%
property boundary and the edge of their
 
01:08:41.550 --> 01:08:41.560 align:start position:0%
grass um to allow sort of malicious
 
01:08:44.510 --> 01:08:44.520 align:start position:0%
actions thank you question
 
01:08:47.870 --> 01:08:47.880 align:start position:0%
representative hembel uh thank you uh Mr
 
01:08:50.550 --> 01:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for being here so
 
01:08:52.550 --> 01:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
just to get something you talk about
 
01:08:55.950 --> 01:08:55.960 align:start position:0%
somebody on with a suspended license
 
01:08:58.470 --> 01:08:58.480 align:start position:0%
uh on a lawnmower riding lawn mower
 
01:09:00.030 --> 01:09:00.040 align:start position:0%
cutting grass on their property which
 
01:09:02.669 --> 01:09:02.679 align:start position:0%
happens to be you know right away on the
 
01:09:05.950 --> 01:09:05.960 align:start position:0%
street so they can be arrested for um
 
01:09:08.349 --> 01:09:08.359 align:start position:0%
driving on the suspended license is that
 
01:09:11.309 --> 01:09:11.319 align:start position:0%
correct um Pro so let me give you a
 
01:09:12.990 --> 01:09:13.000 align:start position:0%
little bit more background right now if
 
01:09:14.590 --> 01:09:14.600 align:start position:0%
you're mowing your lawn and you don't
 
01:09:16.709 --> 01:09:16.719 align:start position:0%
know your property line is 10 fet back
 
01:09:18.870 --> 01:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
from the actual Road and you mow that
 
01:09:20.990 --> 01:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
you're fine you're in the clear because
 
01:09:22.709 --> 01:09:22.719 align:start position:0%
that's between the edge of your property
 
01:09:25.709 --> 01:09:25.719 align:start position:0%
and the unimproved edge of the roadway
 
01:09:28.349 --> 01:09:28.359 align:start position:0%
so right now you would not be arrested
 
01:09:29.789 --> 01:09:29.799 align:start position:0%
for that and you would not lose your
 
01:09:31.390 --> 01:09:31.400 align:start position:0%
license for longer and spend a week in
 
01:09:34.590 --> 01:09:34.600 align:start position:0%
jail this bill if it passes would make
 
01:09:37.070 --> 01:09:37.080 align:start position:0%
it so that if you don't if you go past
 
01:09:39.229 --> 01:09:39.239 align:start position:0%
that that legal line of the edge of your
 
01:09:41.789 --> 01:09:41.799 align:start position:0%
property and go past that on your riding
 
01:09:43.709 --> 01:09:43.719 align:start position:0%
lawn mower you would risk losing your
 
01:09:45.510 --> 01:09:45.520 align:start position:0%
license I think for another six months
 
01:09:48.789 --> 01:09:48.799 align:start position:0%
and spending a week in jail um and I I
 
01:09:50.709 --> 01:09:50.719 align:start position:0%
did look I'm not sure how many people
 
01:09:52.789 --> 01:09:52.799 align:start position:0%
know how close their actual property
 
01:09:54.550 --> 01:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
line is with their edge of their grass
 
01:09:56.390 --> 01:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
but most people mistaken about where
 
01:09:59.630 --> 01:09:59.640 align:start position:0%
those edges are follow up follow
 
01:10:05.990 --> 01:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
up so can my 12 year-old grandson ride
 
01:10:09.310 --> 01:10:09.320 align:start position:0%
or do go over that line and get arrested
 
01:10:11.550 --> 01:10:11.560 align:start position:0%
for not having a license that's a great
 
01:10:13.510 --> 01:10:13.520 align:start position:0%
question if you've never had a license
 
01:10:15.070 --> 01:10:15.080 align:start position:0%
you don't need a license to operate a
 
01:10:18.110 --> 01:10:18.120 align:start position:0%
lawn mower um but previous to this to
 
01:10:20.790 --> 01:10:20.800 align:start position:0%
the the bill that passed last year if
 
01:10:23.590 --> 01:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
you had a suspended license for a DUI
 
01:10:25.790 --> 01:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
you can't operate a riding lawn m but if
 
01:10:27.790 --> 01:10:27.800 align:start position:0%
you've never had a license in your life
 
01:10:29.669 --> 01:10:29.679 align:start position:0%
or you're not old enough for a license
 
01:10:31.709 --> 01:10:31.719 align:start position:0%
you can do a you can use a riding lawn
 
01:10:34.630 --> 01:10:34.640 align:start position:0%
mower it was one of those areas where as
 
01:10:36.510 --> 01:10:36.520 align:start position:0%
we debate all the details of these bills
 
01:10:38.310 --> 01:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
we don't always realize the unintended
 
01:10:40.830 --> 01:10:40.840 align:start position:0%
consequences from our language choices
 
01:10:42.350 --> 01:10:42.360 align:start position:0%
that one actually goes back to when a
 
01:10:44.189 --> 01:10:44.199 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle was described as something
 
01:10:45.709 --> 01:10:45.719 align:start position:0%
with an engine that was operated on a
 
01:10:48.030 --> 01:10:48.040 align:start position:0%
way and then we recodified our laws in
 
01:10:50.590 --> 01:10:50.600 align:start position:0%
the 30s and we changed the definition of
 
01:10:52.390 --> 01:10:52.400 align:start position:0%
way and we didn't change the definition
 
01:10:54.830 --> 01:10:54.840 align:start position:0%
of Motor Vehicle um so rather than
 
01:10:56.910 --> 01:10:56.920 align:start position:0%
changing the definition of Motor Vehicle
 
01:10:58.430 --> 01:10:58.440 align:start position:0%
back to something that's operated on a
 
01:11:02.470 --> 01:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
way because that has bigger issues um
 
01:11:04.870 --> 01:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
the the simple idea was that nobody
 
01:11:06.669 --> 01:11:06.679 align:start position:0%
realized that it was illegal to operate
 
01:11:09.110 --> 01:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
a lawn mower or a tractor on private
 
01:11:10.990 --> 01:11:11.000 align:start position:0%
property everybody always thought that
 
01:11:13.709 --> 01:11:13.719 align:start position:0%
that was just an issue on on on state
 
01:11:16.229 --> 01:11:16.239 align:start position:0%
roads on ways but that's not what the
 
01:11:18.910 --> 01:11:18.920 align:start position:0%
law said so I came in last year change
 
01:11:21.350 --> 01:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
that language so that if you have a
 
01:11:23.030 --> 01:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
suspended license you're treated the
 
01:11:24.470 --> 01:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
same as somebody who's never had a
 
01:11:27.189 --> 01:11:27.199 align:start position:0%
license in operating a lawn mower or a
 
01:11:30.510 --> 01:11:30.520 align:start position:0%
tractor or another another motor vehicle
 
01:11:34.070 --> 01:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
um and and this is this this bill today
 
01:11:35.550 --> 01:11:35.560 align:start position:0%
is one that would make it so that
 
01:11:37.790 --> 01:11:37.800 align:start position:0%
there's a gray area between your
 
01:11:39.750 --> 01:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
property and the lawn where you get in a
 
01:11:42.590 --> 01:11:42.600 align:start position:0%
whole heap of of trouble thank
 
01:11:45.310 --> 01:11:45.320 align:start position:0%
you any other questions representative
 
01:11:48.830 --> 01:11:48.840 align:start position:0%
Peto question of the chair um do we have
 
01:11:50.550 --> 01:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
somebody from the Department of Justice
 
01:11:52.669 --> 01:11:52.679 align:start position:0%
signed up to speak I do not have any
 
01:11:56.390 --> 01:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
other pink cards thank you right now
 
01:11:59.830 --> 01:11:59.840 align:start position:0%
representative J G thank you Mr chair uh
 
01:12:00.910 --> 01:12:00.920 align:start position:0%
thank you honorable representative
 
01:12:02.830 --> 01:12:02.840 align:start position:0%
taking the question so my understanding
 
01:12:04.750 --> 01:12:04.760 align:start position:0%
is that a driver's license gives you
 
01:12:06.510 --> 01:12:06.520 align:start position:0%
permission to drive on public roadways
 
01:12:08.590 --> 01:12:08.600 align:start position:0%
and that law enforcement enforces the
 
01:12:10.669 --> 01:12:10.679 align:start position:0%
rules of public
 
01:12:14.910 --> 01:12:14.920 align:start position:0%
roadways if is it are you saying that if
 
01:12:16.510 --> 01:12:16.520 align:start position:0%
this goes through it will revoke the
 
01:12:18.950 --> 01:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
language that defines a public roadway
 
01:12:20.830 --> 01:12:20.840 align:start position:0%
and therefore would expand the scope of
 
01:12:24.390 --> 01:12:24.400 align:start position:0%
Duty for law enforcement to go onto
 
01:12:25.830 --> 01:12:25.840 align:start position:0%
private properties looking for mowers I
 
01:12:27.270 --> 01:12:27.280 align:start position:0%
don't think that they ever would but is
 
01:12:29.669 --> 01:12:29.679 align:start position:0%
that what why this is important um the
 
01:12:31.310 --> 01:12:31.320 align:start position:0%
reason this is important is because the
 
01:12:33.830 --> 01:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
way is Def defined as that section from
 
01:12:35.390 --> 01:12:35.400 align:start position:0%
the edge of one property to another
 
01:12:38.070 --> 01:12:38.080 align:start position:0%
where a road is a lot of times that
 
01:12:41.270 --> 01:12:41.280 align:start position:0%
legal way is larger than the actual road
 
01:12:43.910 --> 01:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
that we think of as the road so because
 
01:12:45.830 --> 01:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
that is larger than that actual edge of
 
01:12:48.430 --> 01:12:48.440 align:start position:0%
the road uh this build this section
 
01:12:50.709 --> 01:12:50.719 align:start position:0%
that's being repealed by this bill only
 
01:12:52.750 --> 01:12:52.760 align:start position:0%
addresses the operating with a suspended
 
01:12:55.310 --> 01:12:55.320 align:start position:0%
license with a motor vehicle on that
 
01:12:56.790 --> 01:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
distance between what's commonly
 
01:12:59.350 --> 01:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
understood as the road and what's
 
01:13:02.629 --> 01:13:02.639 align:start position:0%
legally the way but appears to be
 
01:13:02.639 --> 01:13:05.430 align:start position:0%
legally the way but appears to be
private

01:13:05.430 --> 01:13:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:08.070 --> 01:13:08.080 align:start position:0%
property any other questions from the
 
01:13:10.510 --> 01:13:10.520 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing any thank you so
 
01:13:12.990 --> 01:13:13.000 align:start position:0%
much if I may say one more thing you may
 
01:13:15.030 --> 01:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
um I will speak with the Department of
 
01:13:16.870 --> 01:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
Justice Department of Transportation see
 
01:13:18.070 --> 01:13:18.080 align:start position:0%
if we can come up with something that
 
01:13:19.629 --> 01:13:19.639 align:start position:0%
makes everybody happy and then bring it
 
01:13:21.430 --> 01:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
to the committee if that would if that
 
01:13:23.790 --> 01:13:23.800 align:start position:0%
would be amendable to the committee yes
 
01:13:25.830 --> 01:13:25.840 align:start position:0%
if you can let uh let the chairman know
 
01:13:27.189 --> 01:13:27.199 align:start position:0%
or send it to the chairman chairman
 
01:13:30.669 --> 01:13:30.679 align:start position:0%
Walsh will take that under arisman thank
 
01:13:34.470 --> 01:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
you representative P pom just one one
 
01:13:35.990 --> 01:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
quick question and thank you Mr chair
 
01:13:38.310 --> 01:13:38.320 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking a question is
 
01:13:40.110 --> 01:13:40.120 align:start position:0%
is my understanding that you're saying
 
01:13:42.070 --> 01:13:42.080 align:start position:0%
the no one
 
01:13:44.990 --> 01:13:45.000 align:start position:0%
has received any violations or been been
 
01:13:48.310 --> 01:13:48.320 align:start position:0%
arrested for this to date we're being
 
01:13:52.189 --> 01:13:52.199 align:start position:0%
proactive is that what I understand um
 
01:13:55.990 --> 01:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
yes um then so nobody had been arrested
 
01:13:58.709 --> 01:13:58.719 align:start position:0%
for that um so I guess we'll do a little
 
01:14:01.070 --> 01:14:01.080 align:start position:0%
bit of a public service announcement for
 
01:14:03.310 --> 01:14:03.320 align:start position:0%
people to make good choices on the last
 
01:14:05.310 --> 01:14:05.320 align:start position:0%
day of session in my first term I went
 
01:14:07.709 --> 01:14:07.719 align:start position:0%
out after session and was arrested for a
 
01:14:10.750 --> 01:14:10.760 align:start position:0%
DUI in my driveway um when that happened
 
01:14:12.590 --> 01:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
you know I deserved it I took all of the
 
01:14:15.390 --> 01:14:15.400 align:start position:0%
punishment but my husband had punishment
 
01:14:18.790 --> 01:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
that had to take punishment so he had to
 
01:14:20.189 --> 01:14:20.199 align:start position:0%
drive the kids he had to do all the
 
01:14:21.790 --> 01:14:21.800 align:start position:0%
errands he had to drive me where I had
 
01:14:24.510 --> 01:14:24.520 align:start position:0%
to go he had to go to work and because
 
01:14:27.830 --> 01:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
my lawyer advised me that you could not
 
01:14:29.430 --> 01:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
operate a motor vehicle including a
 
01:14:31.750 --> 01:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
riding lawn mower he had to do all of
 
01:14:33.550 --> 01:14:33.560 align:start position:0%
that and then come home and mow all of
 
01:14:36.229 --> 01:14:36.239 align:start position:0%
our grass uh I may be a bit of a special
 
01:14:38.110 --> 01:14:38.120 align:start position:0%
case because there's some people in town
 
01:14:41.430 --> 01:14:41.440 align:start position:0%
that like me some people that don't um I
 
01:14:43.990 --> 01:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
live one and a half miles from the
 
01:14:45.790 --> 01:14:45.800 align:start position:0%
police station on a major road and
 
01:14:47.430 --> 01:14:47.440 align:start position:0%
everybody sees me when I'm out in my
 
01:14:50.629 --> 01:14:50.639 align:start position:0%
yard um I was not willing to be a test
 
01:14:53.070 --> 01:14:53.080 align:start position:0%
case to be the first person arrested for
 
01:14:55.310 --> 01:14:55.320 align:start position:0%
that lose my license for another six
 
01:14:57.070 --> 01:14:57.080 align:start position:0%
months and spend seven nights in jail
 
01:14:59.990 --> 01:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
away from my young children uh rather
 
01:15:02.629 --> 01:15:02.639 align:start position:0%
than having the very heavy hand of the
 
01:15:04.430 --> 01:15:04.440 align:start position:0%
law come down on somebody I thought the
 
01:15:06.110 --> 01:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
appropriate thing was to change this in
 
01:15:08.629 --> 01:15:08.639 align:start position:0%
the legislature um I have to say every
 
01:15:10.270 --> 01:15:10.280 align:start position:0%
time I bring this up I'm ashamed about
 
01:15:12.669 --> 01:15:12.679 align:start position:0%
what I did but I can't change the past
 
01:15:14.189 --> 01:15:14.199 align:start position:0%
and I'm not the only person in the state
 
01:15:16.709 --> 01:15:16.719 align:start position:0%
that's made that mistake so I want to
 
01:15:18.270 --> 01:15:18.280 align:start position:0%
make sure that I'm standing up for
 
01:15:20.790 --> 01:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
everybody especially those who

the committee so I'm introducing House
Bill

01:21:51.390 --> 01:21:51.400 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
01:21:54.709 --> 01:21:54.719 align:start position:0%
632 uh which which as chair stated
 
01:21:56.910 --> 01:21:56.920 align:start position:0%
provides the uh provides healthc care
 
01:21:58.550 --> 01:21:58.560 align:start position:0%
providers affiliated with the VA to
 
01:22:00.189 --> 01:22:00.199 align:start position:0%
certify medical accommodations
 
01:22:02.229 --> 01:22:02.239 align:start position:0%
specifically equipment accommodations
 
01:22:04.950 --> 01:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
for veterans in New Hampshire uh this
 
01:22:06.950 --> 01:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
basically is to close a loophole that
 
01:22:08.709 --> 01:22:08.719 align:start position:0%
was that was inadvertently opened up by
 
01:22:11.550 --> 01:22:11.560 align:start position:0%
the jail car last year uh through safe C
 
01:22:16.270 --> 01:22:16.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:20.110 --> 01:22:20.120 align:start position:0%
21.8 which read that in order for uh
 
01:22:22.110 --> 01:22:22.120 align:start position:0%
medical provision or exception to
 
01:22:23.870 --> 01:22:23.880 align:start position:0%
equipment to be provided that the
 
01:22:25.189 --> 01:22:25.199 align:start position:0%
healthcare provider provider had to be
 
01:22:26.990 --> 01:22:27.000 align:start position:0%
an instate licensed healthc care
 
01:22:29.270 --> 01:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
provider what that did was inadvertently
 
01:22:31.070 --> 01:22:31.080 align:start position:0%
disqualify Healthcare Providers from the
 
01:22:34.070 --> 01:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
VA most of which are licensed healthc
 
01:22:35.430 --> 01:22:35.440 align:start position:0%
care providers in other states who
 
01:22:36.950 --> 01:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
through Federal contract take an
 
01:22:39.229 --> 01:22:39.239 align:start position:0%
assignments somewhere so like if you
 
01:22:41.189 --> 01:22:41.199 align:start position:0%
walk through the Manchester VA most of
 
01:22:43.510 --> 01:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
those Health Care Providers doctors
 
01:22:46.229 --> 01:22:46.239 align:start position:0%
nurses Pas Etc they're not licensed in
 
01:22:48.030 --> 01:22:48.040 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire they're
 
01:22:50.950 --> 01:22:50.960 align:start position:0%
practicing on their Federal
 
01:22:53.430 --> 01:22:53.440 align:start position:0%
reciprocity on an assignment here in New
 
01:22:56.910 --> 01:22:56.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um this may not be compliant
 
01:23:00.070 --> 01:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
with several ADA rules already and so
 
01:23:03.070 --> 01:23:03.080 align:start position:0%
what this bill does is it resolves that
 
01:23:05.189 --> 01:23:05.199 align:start position:0%
VA healthc care providers can write
 
01:23:06.910 --> 01:23:06.920 align:start position:0%
these medical exceptions for equipment
 
01:23:08.590 --> 01:23:08.600 align:start position:0%
that will be accepted by the
 
01:23:12.390 --> 01:23:12.400 align:start position:0%
DMV um for for instances of handicap or
 
01:23:14.790 --> 01:23:14.800 align:start position:0%
instances of medical disability I did
 
01:23:17.270 --> 01:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
sit with uh director morasco I sat with
 
01:23:19.629 --> 01:23:19.639 align:start position:0%
the adant general and I sat with the
 
01:23:21.390 --> 01:23:21.400 align:start position:0%
chief medical officer at the at the
 
01:23:24.270 --> 01:23:24.280 align:start position:0%
Manchester VA hospital and all three of
 
01:23:26.830 --> 01:23:26.840 align:start position:0%
them said it would take us less time to
 
01:23:28.390 --> 01:23:28.400 align:start position:0%
put legislation through to close this
 
01:23:29.990 --> 01:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
loophole than it would for them to go
 
01:23:33.070 --> 01:23:33.080 align:start position:0%
through the rules change process um so
 
01:23:35.390 --> 01:23:35.400 align:start position:0%
it was recommended that we purs pursue
 
01:23:35.400 --> 01:23:36.430 align:start position:0%
it was recommended that we purs pursue
this

01:23:36.430 --> 01:23:36.440 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:23:39.229 --> 01:23:39.239 align:start position:0%
legislation um it'll it'll restore the
 
01:23:40.870 --> 01:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
intent of the law faster than going
 
01:23:42.390 --> 01:23:42.400 align:start position:0%
through the rules change process and it
 
01:23:45.470 --> 01:23:45.480 align:start position:0%
will likely keep us out of a major
 
01:23:48.629 --> 01:23:48.639 align:start position:0%
lawsuit uh pending any questions thank
 
01:23:50.550 --> 01:23:50.560 align:start position:0%
you sir any questions from the committee
 
01:23:57.149 --> 01:23:57.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:58.470 --> 01:23:58.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you
 
01:24:00.310 --> 01:24:00.320 align:start position:0%
representative gon for being here today
 
01:24:03.110 --> 01:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
and taking questions
 
01:24:05.709 --> 01:24:05.719 align:start position:0%
um based on your last question is there
 
01:24:08.110 --> 01:24:08.120 align:start position:0%
a Financial Risk if we do not pass this
 
01:24:10.830 --> 01:24:10.840 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you for your question uh
 
01:24:13.709 --> 01:24:13.719 align:start position:0%
representative yes so uh there are
 
01:24:15.229 --> 01:24:15.239 align:start position:0%
already a group of veterans that are
 
01:24:17.550 --> 01:24:17.560 align:start position:0%
talking to each other about uh a lawsuit
 
01:24:19.310 --> 01:24:19.320 align:start position:0%
possibly a class action lawsuit on the
 
01:24:20.709 --> 01:24:20.719 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire for Ada
 
01:24:22.189 --> 01:24:22.199 align:start position:0%
non-compliance under three different
 
01:24:24.950 --> 01:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
articles of federal law uh by the fact
 
01:24:27.070 --> 01:24:27.080 align:start position:0%
that medical exceptions have started to
 
01:24:29.870 --> 01:24:29.880 align:start position:0%
be denied the first series of phone
 
01:24:32.149 --> 01:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
calls that I got this was actually uh
 
01:24:35.470 --> 01:24:35.480 align:start position:0%
this was submitted to me for draft by a
 
01:24:37.110 --> 01:24:37.120 align:start position:0%
veteran and then I had several other
 
01:24:39.229 --> 01:24:39.239 align:start position:0%
veteran phone calls uh to push it
 
01:24:42.109 --> 01:24:42.119 align:start position:0%
further and basically it started to
 
01:24:44.070 --> 01:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
manifest when people with eye injuries
 
01:24:45.750 --> 01:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
or chronic migraines started to get
 
01:24:48.030 --> 01:24:48.040 align:start position:0%
their windshield tint renewed and the
 
01:24:50.790 --> 01:24:50.800 align:start position:0%
DMV said we can't authorize that because
 
01:24:53.149 --> 01:24:53.159 align:start position:0%
your provider is not in state and then
 
01:24:55.270 --> 01:24:55.280 align:start position:0%
we started looking at where that policy
 
01:24:57.270 --> 01:24:57.280 align:start position:0%
could be applied and it can be applied
 
01:24:59.550 --> 01:24:59.560 align:start position:0%
to several other places which is why at
 
01:25:00.709 --> 01:25:00.719 align:start position:0%
the end of the bill they actually
 
01:25:01.910 --> 01:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
there's bold lettering there was an
 
01:25:05.390 --> 01:25:05.400 align:start position:0%
amendment put in to uh to cover all
 
01:25:07.030 --> 01:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
medical exceptions where it was
 
01:25:09.310 --> 01:25:09.320 align:start position:0%
originally drafted toward the windshield
 
01:25:10.629 --> 01:25:10.639 align:start position:0%
tint because that was kind of the low
 
01:25:13.669 --> 01:25:13.679 align:start position:0%
hanging fruit so my concern is that if
 
01:25:15.430 --> 01:25:15.440 align:start position:0%
this doesn't get through both bodies and
 
01:25:17.590 --> 01:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
signed by the governor quickly we would
 
01:25:19.750 --> 01:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
be facing a lawsuit for Ada
 
01:25:21.550 --> 01:25:21.560 align:start position:0%
non-compliance thank
 
01:25:23.550 --> 01:25:23.560 align:start position:0%
you any other questions for the
 
01:25:25.149 --> 01:25:25.159 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
01:25:27.550 --> 01:25:27.560 align:start position:0%
Miller thank you Mr chairman uh
 
01:25:28.910 --> 01:25:28.920 align:start position:0%
represent guys and thanks for taking my
 
01:25:31.350 --> 01:25:31.360 align:start position:0%
question um in reading this I just want
 
01:25:35.229 --> 01:25:35.239 align:start position:0%
to understand is your expectation that a
 
01:25:38.950 --> 01:25:38.960 align:start position:0%
medical provider uh Associated or
 
01:25:40.709 --> 01:25:40.719 align:start position:0%
affiliated with the US Department of
 
01:25:42.350 --> 01:25:42.360 align:start position:0%
Veterans Affairs which is what's written
 
01:25:45.750 --> 01:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
here um would only be providing this for
 
01:25:49.030 --> 01:25:49.040 align:start position:0%
veterans or is this something where I as
 
01:25:51.550 --> 01:25:51.560 align:start position:0%
a practitioner could be doing some work
 
01:25:53.030 --> 01:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
for the VA and some work in private
 
01:25:55.229 --> 01:25:55.239 align:start position:0%
practice in Massachusetts
 
01:25:58.229 --> 01:25:58.239 align:start position:0%
but issue something for a regular
 
01:26:00.070 --> 01:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
patient who lives in New Hampshire from
 
01:26:02.910 --> 01:26:02.920 align:start position:0%
my practice in Massachusetts who is not
 
01:26:04.870 --> 01:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
a veteran if does that make sense it's
 
01:26:07.270 --> 01:26:07.280 align:start position:0%
sort of a weird I'm looking at edge
 
01:26:09.430 --> 01:26:09.440 align:start position:0%
cases I know but is that something where
 
01:26:11.270 --> 01:26:11.280 align:start position:0%
we think this would happen or is this
 
01:26:14.390 --> 01:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
veterans people at it would be at a va's
 
01:26:16.830 --> 01:26:16.840 align:start position:0%
location or under VA offices that this
 
01:26:19.070 --> 01:26:19.080 align:start position:0%
would be granted to Veterans thank you
 
01:26:21.629 --> 01:26:21.639 align:start position:0%
for the question uh this is specific to
 
01:26:24.430 --> 01:26:24.440 align:start position:0%
practicing for the VA um whether it's on
 
01:26:26.350 --> 01:26:26.360 align:start position:0%
a facility or whether it's uh through
 
01:26:28.350 --> 01:26:28.360 align:start position:0%
contract to the VA at a smaller you know
 
01:26:30.470 --> 01:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
location or even on site location this
 
01:26:32.270 --> 01:26:32.280 align:start position:0%
would not be geared toward private
 
01:26:34.990 --> 01:26:35.000 align:start position:0%
healthcare providers um that would be
 
01:26:36.149 --> 01:26:36.159 align:start position:0%
that would be something different one of
 
01:26:37.750 --> 01:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
the reasons that New Hampshire tried to
 
01:26:39.149 --> 01:26:39.159 align:start position:0%
narrow this down with the healthc care
 
01:26:42.350 --> 01:26:42.360 align:start position:0%
provider is because each state tracks
 
01:26:44.229 --> 01:26:44.239 align:start position:0%
their own licenses and while you have
 
01:26:45.669 --> 01:26:45.679 align:start position:0%
rest prostituted practice in other
 
01:26:47.350 --> 01:26:47.360 align:start position:0%
places each state tracks its own
 
01:26:50.109 --> 01:26:50.119 align:start position:0%
licenses so my understanding when this
 
01:26:52.109 --> 01:26:52.119 align:start position:0%
rule change happened was that they were
 
01:26:54.229 --> 01:26:54.239 align:start position:0%
trying to lean down invest
 
01:26:56.149 --> 01:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
investigations for healthc care
 
01:26:58.470 --> 01:26:58.480 align:start position:0%
providers that are you know maybe tella
 
01:27:00.510 --> 01:27:00.520 align:start position:0%
Health from Michigan or something and
 
01:27:02.430 --> 01:27:02.440 align:start position:0%
they just they just missed an accidently
 
01:27:04.830 --> 01:27:04.840 align:start position:0%
took out the VA it's very easy for the
 
01:27:08.109 --> 01:27:08.119 align:start position:0%
DMV to call Dr Forest over at the at the
 
01:27:10.229 --> 01:27:10.239 align:start position:0%
VA hospital and say hey is this person
 
01:27:12.229 --> 01:27:12.239 align:start position:0%
practicing and licensed it's a lot
 
01:27:13.870 --> 01:27:13.880 align:start position:0%
harder when you get into private
 
01:27:15.709 --> 01:27:15.719 align:start position:0%
practices over the borders where we
 
01:27:17.910 --> 01:27:17.920 align:start position:0%
can't confirm somebody's license in the
 
01:27:19.629 --> 01:27:19.639 align:start position:0%
event of an
 
01:27:21.510 --> 01:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
investigation does does that answer your
 
01:27:25.550 --> 01:27:25.560 align:start position:0%
question sir any other questions a thank
 
01:27:26.790 --> 01:27:26.800 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
01:27:30.350 --> 01:27:30.360 align:start position:0%
question do we need to put a definition
 
01:27:32.149 --> 01:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
of medical provider in there make sure
 
01:27:35.470 --> 01:27:35.480 align:start position:0%
it's not I mean LPN can be a licensed
 
01:27:38.709 --> 01:27:38.719 align:start position:0%
medical provider um do we need to say
 
01:27:42.430 --> 01:27:42.440 align:start position:0%
physician or you know optometrist or
 
01:27:44.669 --> 01:27:44.679 align:start position:0%
something along those lines to kind of
 
01:27:47.070 --> 01:27:47.080 align:start position:0%
narrow the scope of this thank you for
 
01:27:49.590 --> 01:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
your question um I used the term medical
 
01:27:51.510 --> 01:27:51.520 align:start position:0%
provider because that term is already
 
01:27:53.070 --> 01:27:53.080 align:start position:0%
codified into law in the state of New
 
01:27:55.510 --> 01:27:55.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire there are laws that say what a
 
01:27:58.229 --> 01:27:58.239 align:start position:0%
medical provider is what licenses in are
 
01:28:00.510 --> 01:28:00.520 align:start position:0%
included I stayed away from terms such
 
01:28:02.350 --> 01:28:02.360 align:start position:0%
as doctor because I did not want to
 
01:28:04.030 --> 01:28:04.040 align:start position:0%
contest the state's pre-aligned
 
01:28:06.470 --> 01:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
definition of what a medical provider is
 
01:28:08.189 --> 01:28:08.199 align:start position:0%
so this isn't going to play differently
 
01:28:10.870 --> 01:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
with existing
 
01:28:14.030 --> 01:28:14.040 align:start position:0%
laws follow would it would it be better
 
01:28:16.390 --> 01:28:16.400 align:start position:0%
to put a reference to that law that
 
01:28:19.470 --> 01:28:19.480 align:start position:0%
defines medic as defined by RSA blah
 
01:28:25.270 --> 01:28:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:26.830 --> 01:28:26.840 align:start position:0%
I think that we could do that but where
 
01:28:28.550 --> 01:28:28.560 align:start position:0%
we already have a definition of medical
 
01:28:30.590 --> 01:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
provider in law I don't know that it
 
01:28:32.830 --> 01:28:32.840 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:28:35.350 --> 01:28:35.360 align:start position:0%
necessary any other questions from the
 
01:28:37.470 --> 01:28:37.480 align:start position:0%
committee one quick question before I
 
01:28:40.470 --> 01:28:40.480 align:start position:0%
let you go if this passes does it help
 
01:28:43.910 --> 01:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
our vets if this bill passes to get
 
01:28:46.149 --> 01:28:46.159 align:start position:0%
treatment you know more efficiently and
 
01:28:46.159 --> 01:28:46.910 align:start position:0%
treatment you know more efficiently and
more

01:28:46.910 --> 01:28:46.920 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:28:49.430 --> 01:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
effectively yes it does it also helps
 
01:28:51.750 --> 01:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
our veterans get medical accommodations
 
01:28:53.590 --> 01:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
um for Disabilities that are recognized
 
01:28:56.590 --> 01:28:56.600 align:start position:0%
through the V by not having to go pay a
 
01:28:58.910 --> 01:28:58.920 align:start position:0%
separate private practitioner and you
 
01:29:01.109 --> 01:29:01.119 align:start position:0%
know many veterans that are using the VA
 
01:29:04.229 --> 01:29:04.239 align:start position:0%
as their sole healthc care um don't
 
01:29:05.709 --> 01:29:05.719 align:start position:0%
don't have the money to go hire another
 
01:29:07.189 --> 01:29:07.199 align:start position:0%
doctor somewhere they're getting that at
 
01:29:08.550 --> 01:29:08.560 align:start position:0%
that is their health insurance and that
 
01:29:09.830 --> 01:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
is their health
 
01:29:11.790 --> 01:29:11.800 align:start position:0%

01:29:13.950 --> 01:29:13.960 align:start position:0%

have a retired vet whose primary
 
01:29:24.709 --> 01:29:24.719 align:start position:0%

thank you

01:30:06.229 --> 01:30:06.239 align:start position:0%
representative uh Lon uh who is in
 
01:30:10.390 --> 01:30:10.400 align:start position:0%
support of the bill welcome
 
01:30:12.750 --> 01:30:12.760 align:start position:0%
back thank you Mr chairman and members
 
01:30:14.750 --> 01:30:14.760 align:start position:0%
of the committee um I'm sorry that we
 
01:30:16.870 --> 01:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
need to be here today for this bill as a
 
01:30:18.350 --> 01:30:18.360 align:start position:0%
member of The Joint legislative
 
01:30:20.950 --> 01:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
committee on administrative rules I was
 
01:30:22.510 --> 01:30:22.520 align:start position:0%
one of the people that passed this
 
01:30:24.390 --> 01:30:24.400 align:start position:0%
language that unintentional
 
01:30:26.870 --> 01:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
discriminated against the VA we are very
 
01:30:29.669 --> 01:30:29.679 align:start position:0%
limited in what it is that we can do in
 
01:30:33.030 --> 01:30:33.040 align:start position:0%
jail car looking to our job is to see if
 
01:30:35.669 --> 01:30:35.679 align:start position:0%
the rules are authorized under the
 
01:30:37.590 --> 01:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
statutes if they're aligned with the
 
01:30:39.310 --> 01:30:39.320 align:start position:0%
underlying statutes and then there's a
 
01:30:41.870 --> 01:30:41.880 align:start position:0%
general public interest Clause um had we
 
01:30:43.629 --> 01:30:43.639 align:start position:0%
been aware of this at the time we would
 
01:30:45.149 --> 01:30:45.159 align:start position:0%
have raised the public interest Clause
 
01:30:48.830 --> 01:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
to also include VA Physicians but um if
 
01:30:50.229 --> 01:30:50.239 align:start position:0%
you want to look at the schedule that we
 
01:30:52.510 --> 01:30:52.520 align:start position:0%
have coming up this Friday just listing
 
01:30:54.629 --> 01:30:54.639 align:start position:0%
the rules that we have is over a page
 
01:30:56.270 --> 01:30:56.280 align:start position:0%
and some of those are hundreds of pages
 
01:30:59.669 --> 01:30:59.679 align:start position:0%
long so we rely on other people to find
 
01:31:02.350 --> 01:31:02.360 align:start position:0%
issues um when necessary um as a side
 
01:31:03.830 --> 01:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
note I'm hoping that this committee has
 
01:31:06.430 --> 01:31:06.440 align:start position:0%
somebody looking over the transportation
 
01:31:08.390 --> 01:31:08.400 align:start position:0%
rules that we are adopting because there
 
01:31:10.390 --> 01:31:10.400 align:start position:0%
is nothing like experienced eyes who
 
01:31:12.950 --> 01:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
helped pass the laws to make sure that
 
01:31:15.310 --> 01:31:15.320 align:start position:0%
the administrative rules do follow the
 
01:31:18.430 --> 01:31:18.440 align:start position:0%
intention of the the past language um so
 
01:31:21.070 --> 01:31:21.080 align:start position:0%
in Jael car we generally look to a lot
 
01:31:24.310 --> 01:31:24.320 align:start position:0%
of things around licensing and I believe
 
01:31:26.149 --> 01:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
and I wasn't intimately involved with
 
01:31:27.510 --> 01:31:27.520 align:start position:0%
the bill as it went through but I
 
01:31:29.189 --> 01:31:29.199 align:start position:0%
believe that there was a question about
 
01:31:30.830 --> 01:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
whether we want to allow outof State
 
01:31:33.030 --> 01:31:33.040 align:start position:0%
providers or just inate providers to do
 
01:31:35.470 --> 01:31:35.480 align:start position:0%
this and to provide this Li this um
 
01:31:37.990 --> 01:31:38.000 align:start position:0%
certification um I do think um
 
01:31:39.390 --> 01:31:39.400 align:start position:0%
representative Miller that it may make
 
01:31:41.310 --> 01:31:41.320 align:start position:0%
sense to talk to people who have been
 
01:31:42.669 --> 01:31:42.679 align:start position:0%
involved in this and potentially look to
 
01:31:44.870 --> 01:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
bring a broader bill that would allow
 
01:31:47.229 --> 01:31:47.239 align:start position:0%
crossborder uh Physicians to write these
 
01:31:48.790 --> 01:31:48.800 align:start position:0%
permissions but that's outside of the
 
01:31:51.390 --> 01:31:51.400 align:start position:0%
scope of this existing bill um speaking
 
01:31:54.870 --> 01:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
to Veterans Administration provid ERS um
 
01:31:56.750 --> 01:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
if you look at veterans in New Hampshire
 
01:31:58.550 --> 01:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
they don't just go to the vas that are
 
01:32:00.629 --> 01:32:00.639 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire they go to the ones in
 
01:32:02.590 --> 01:32:02.600 align:start position:0%
Maine they go to the ones in Vermont and
 
01:32:05.030 --> 01:32:05.040 align:start position:0%
they go to the ones in Massachusetts and
 
01:32:06.950 --> 01:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
that's if they're residing full-time in
 
01:32:09.510 --> 01:32:09.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire for those who also travel
 
01:32:11.070 --> 01:32:11.080 align:start position:0%
it's quite likely that they would visit
 
01:32:14.510 --> 01:32:14.520 align:start position:0%
other vas as well and since everyone who
 
01:32:16.390 --> 01:32:16.400 align:start position:0%
served wrote a check for everything up
 
01:32:17.790 --> 01:32:17.800 align:start position:0%
to and including their life I think the
 
01:32:19.950 --> 01:32:19.960 align:start position:0%
least thing we can do is allow them to
 
01:32:21.950 --> 01:32:21.960 align:start position:0%
be seen by VA doctors anywhere in the
 
01:32:23.510 --> 01:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
state and get the accommodations that
 
01:32:25.189 --> 01:32:25.199 align:start position:0%
they need on their
 
01:32:27.350 --> 01:32:27.360 align:start position:0%
licenses um speaking to the issue of
 
01:32:29.550 --> 01:32:29.560 align:start position:0%
medical providers and the definitions
 
01:32:32.629 --> 01:32:32.639 align:start position:0%
this law is really informing some of the
 
01:32:34.709 --> 01:32:34.719 align:start position:0%
administrative rules that'll be reopt it
 
01:32:37.430 --> 01:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
after we pass this law and they are very
 
01:32:39.030 --> 01:32:39.040 align:start position:0%
comfortable and very familiar with the
 
01:32:41.189 --> 01:32:41.199 align:start position:0%
definition of medical provider and
 
01:32:43.070 --> 01:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
linking it to a definition somewhere in
 
01:32:45.510 --> 01:32:45.520 align:start position:0%
the statutes um wouldn't add any more
 
01:32:48.070 --> 01:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
transparency or any more helpfulness um
 
01:32:49.990 --> 01:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
as somebody who served three years on
 
01:32:52.350 --> 01:32:52.360 align:start position:0%
the Health and Human Services committee
 
01:32:54.109 --> 01:32:54.119 align:start position:0%
um I realized just how many Medical
 
01:32:56.030 --> 01:32:56.040 align:start position:0%
providers we have in the state for those
 
01:32:57.390 --> 01:32:57.400 align:start position:0%
of you who don't know we actually have
 
01:32:59.109 --> 01:32:59.119 align:start position:0%
Physicians assistants that are sometimes
 
01:33:01.310 --> 01:33:01.320 align:start position:0%
the senior person on staff at a hospital
 
01:33:03.189 --> 01:33:03.199 align:start position:0%
up in the North Country so the last
 
01:33:04.870 --> 01:33:04.880 align:start position:0%
thing I want to do is limit their
 
01:33:06.629 --> 01:33:06.639 align:start position:0%
ability to make sure that somebody can
 
01:33:09.109 --> 01:33:09.119 align:start position:0%
get the accommodations that they need um
 
01:33:11.390 --> 01:33:11.400 align:start position:0%
I do want to thank representative gisan
 
01:33:13.070 --> 01:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
for bringing this bill um it's
 
01:33:14.830 --> 01:33:14.840 align:start position:0%
absolutely critical that we update this
 
01:33:17.390 --> 01:33:17.400 align:start position:0%
and we fix this um once this is done
 
01:33:18.990 --> 01:33:19.000 align:start position:0%
they'll be able to spe speed through an
 
01:33:21.510 --> 01:33:21.520 align:start position:0%
emergency rule in Jael car where that
 
01:33:24.350 --> 01:33:24.360 align:start position:0%
can get get basically put into effect
 
01:33:26.629 --> 01:33:26.639 align:start position:0%
while they rewrite all of the language
 
01:33:28.109 --> 01:33:28.119 align:start position:0%
but there's an entire process for
 
01:33:29.830 --> 01:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
adopting a rule where you need to have
 
01:33:31.550 --> 01:33:31.560 align:start position:0%
the language which can take months to
 
01:33:33.790 --> 01:33:33.800 align:start position:0%
get have a public hearing then digest
 
01:33:35.950 --> 01:33:35.960 align:start position:0%
the information from the public hearing
 
01:33:37.669 --> 01:33:37.679 align:start position:0%
and then go through the actual approval
 
01:33:40.430 --> 01:33:40.440 align:start position:0%
process with jel car car even on an easy
 
01:33:43.030 --> 01:33:43.040 align:start position:0%
change it takes the better part of a
 
01:33:45.390 --> 01:33:45.400 align:start position:0%
year so I'm hopeful that this committee
 
01:33:48.510 --> 01:33:48.520 align:start position:0%
will adopt this take it as it's written
 
01:33:50.310 --> 01:33:50.320 align:start position:0%
pass it through and hopefully we can
 
01:33:52.270 --> 01:33:52.280 align:start position:0%
encourage our friends on the other side
 
01:33:54.229 --> 01:33:54.239 align:start position:0%
of the wall to pick this up quickly
 
01:33:56.189 --> 01:33:56.199 align:start position:0%
so that we can make sure that veterans
 
01:33:57.629 --> 01:33:57.639 align:start position:0%
are getting the getting the
 
01:33:59.709 --> 01:33:59.719 align:start position:0%

Enfield um I do support this bill um and
 
01:34:31.709 --> 01:34:31.719 align:start position:0%
I would posit that there are civilians
 
01:34:31.719 --> 01:34:32.830 align:start position:0%
I would posit that there are civilians
non

01:34:32.830 --> 01:34:32.840 align:start position:0%
non
 
01:34:36.750 --> 01:34:36.760 align:start position:0%
veterans who if you were
 
01:34:41.470 --> 01:34:41.480 align:start position:0%
to amend the bill to include providers
 
01:34:43.510 --> 01:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
from neighboring
 
01:34:47.470 --> 01:34:47.480 align:start position:0%
states would greatly benefit I'm sure
 
01:34:48.669 --> 01:34:48.679 align:start position:0%
that there
 
01:34:48.679 --> 01:34:50.510 align:start position:0%
that there
are

01:34:50.510 --> 01:34:50.520 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:34:53.149 --> 01:34:53.159 align:start position:0%
residents along the Connecticut River
 
01:34:56.030 --> 01:34:56.040 align:start position:0%
Valley the Massachusetts border and the
 
01:35:00.229 --> 01:35:00.239 align:start position:0%
Maine border who are not affiliated with
 
01:35:03.790 --> 01:35:03.800 align:start position:0%
a VA hospital because they have never
 
01:35:05.629 --> 01:35:05.639 align:start position:0%
served the United
 
01:35:09.870 --> 01:35:09.880 align:start position:0%
States who see a provider in a different
 
01:35:14.790 --> 01:35:14.800 align:start position:0%
state and as long as we are looking at
 
01:35:18.310 --> 01:35:18.320 align:start position:0%
this bill focused on Veterans I am
 
01:35:21.750 --> 01:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
asking the committee to broaden it
 
01:35:28.510 --> 01:35:28.520 align:start position:0%
slightly and make the same typee of uh
 
01:35:32.590 --> 01:35:32.600 align:start position:0%
accommodation available to Residents who
 
01:35:36.550 --> 01:35:36.560 align:start position:0%
seek and have been seeking their health
 
01:35:40.550 --> 01:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
care from a provider in a neighboring or
 
01:35:40.560 --> 01:35:42.270 align:start position:0%
care from a provider in a neighboring or
ating

01:35:42.270 --> 01:35:42.280 align:start position:0%
ating
 
01:35:45.709 --> 01:35:45.719 align:start position:0%
State thank you thank you any questions
 
01:35:47.990 --> 01:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
from committee representative a just to
 
01:35:49.270 --> 01:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
clarify what you're saying so if
 
01:35:51.510 --> 01:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
somebody who lives in New Hampshire goes
 
01:35:55.030 --> 01:35:55.040 align:start position:0%
to Boston and to to seek a
 
01:35:57.030 --> 01:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
specialist and the specialist says you
 
01:35:58.950 --> 01:35:58.960 align:start position:0%
need to need to have your window tinted
 
01:36:02.629 --> 01:36:02.639 align:start position:0%
to you know mitigate your this problem
 
01:36:04.149 --> 01:36:04.159 align:start position:0%
they would then have to come back to New
 
01:36:07.270 --> 01:36:07.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and find a specialist
 
01:36:09.510 --> 01:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
here to give them that waiver because
 
01:36:11.430 --> 01:36:11.440 align:start position:0%
the specialist in Massachusetts is not a
 
01:36:13.830 --> 01:36:13.840 align:start position:0%
licensed in New Hampshire that would be
 
01:36:16.550 --> 01:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
the case currently and I'm proposing
 
01:36:20.750 --> 01:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
that the New Hampshire DMV would be able
 
01:36:23.750 --> 01:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
to accept the certification from from
 
01:36:27.550 --> 01:36:27.560 align:start position:0%
the specialist in Boston or the primary
 
01:36:27.560 --> 01:36:29.510 align:start position:0%
the specialist in Boston or the primary
care

01:36:29.510 --> 01:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
care
 
01:36:33.510 --> 01:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
in for instance White River
 
01:36:36.870 --> 01:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
Junction follow up so you know so
 
01:36:39.830 --> 01:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
another scenario is that usually if you
 
01:36:41.030 --> 01:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
you live in New Hampshire you have a
 
01:36:43.590 --> 01:36:43.600 align:start position:0%
primary care position here and then you
 
01:36:45.510 --> 01:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
you go under the care of a specialist
 
01:36:47.590 --> 01:36:47.600 align:start position:0%
out of state but they refer you back to
 
01:36:47.600 --> 01:36:48.910 align:start position:0%
out of state but they refer you back to
the

01:36:48.910 --> 01:36:48.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:36:51.270 --> 01:36:51.280 align:start position:0%
your your local
 
01:36:53.870 --> 01:36:53.880 align:start position:0%
PCP to to issue any order or
 
01:36:56.350 --> 01:36:56.360 align:start position:0%
prescriptions or well I I would posit
 
01:36:59.870 --> 01:36:59.880 align:start position:0%
that if I lived in say
 
01:37:02.310 --> 01:37:02.320 align:start position:0%
Claremont I don't believe Claremont has
 
01:37:02.320 --> 01:37:03.030 align:start position:0%
Claremont I don't believe Claremont has
a

01:37:03.030 --> 01:37:03.040 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:37:08.750 --> 01:37:08.760 align:start position:0%
hospital um and I my primary care was
 
01:37:12.229 --> 01:37:12.239 align:start position:0%
from Springfield Vermont hospital that
 
01:37:17.109 --> 01:37:17.119 align:start position:0%
the physician or health care provider
 
01:37:20.629 --> 01:37:20.639 align:start position:0%
working and licensed at the Springfield
 
01:37:23.510 --> 01:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
Vermont Hospital could then be off
 
01:37:25.830 --> 01:37:25.840 align:start position:0%
authorized to provide the
 
01:37:28.470 --> 01:37:28.480 align:start position:0%
certification perfect thank you any
 
01:37:30.430 --> 01:37:30.440 align:start position:0%
other questions from the committee not
 
01:37:32.950 --> 01:37:32.960 align:start position:0%

title
 
01:43:26.270 --> 01:43:26.280 align:start position:0%
um I am going unscripted so be gentle on
 
01:43:28.030 --> 01:43:28.040 align:start position:0%
me I know this is a pretty intimidating
 
01:43:30.669 --> 01:43:30.679 align:start position:0%
committee to be sitting in front of um a
 
01:43:32.109 --> 01:43:32.119 align:start position:0%
lot of you that were here last year
 
01:43:33.790 --> 01:43:33.800 align:start position:0%
probably recognized this bill that
 
01:43:35.550 --> 01:43:35.560 align:start position:0%
started out as House Bill
 
01:43:38.070 --> 01:43:38.080 align:start position:0%
1118 which just to get into the bill
 
01:43:40.470 --> 01:43:40.480 align:start position:0%
itself for a few minutes consisted of
 
01:43:44.310 --> 01:43:44.320 align:start position:0%
basically lines three
 
01:43:46.109 --> 01:43:46.119 align:start position:0%
through uh
 
01:43:48.390 --> 01:43:48.400 align:start position:0%
25 those were just
 
01:43:50.990 --> 01:43:51.000 align:start position:0%
changes um that were actually put in by
 
01:43:52.589 --> 01:43:52.599 align:start position:0%
another member of the committee last
 
01:43:55.390 --> 01:43:55.400 align:start position:0%
year uh dealing with how you get a
 
01:43:58.109 --> 01:43:58.119 align:start position:0%
license and requirements of the director
 
01:44:00.589 --> 01:44:00.599 align:start position:0%
of Motor Vehicles on on what shall be
 
01:44:02.589 --> 01:44:02.599 align:start position:0%
relative information for for his
 
01:44:04.109 --> 01:44:04.119 align:start position:0%
decision or her decision to give him a
 
01:44:06.109 --> 01:44:06.119 align:start position:0%
license so those changes are pretty
 
01:44:08.750 --> 01:44:08.760 align:start position:0%
simple um and again that's lines 3
 
01:44:11.430 --> 01:44:11.440 align:start position:0%
through 25 uh line 7 talks with
 
01:44:14.750 --> 01:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding 26340 a which is just a
 
01:44:16.390 --> 01:44:16.400 align:start position:0%
requirement the social security number
 
01:44:18.990 --> 01:44:19.000 align:start position:0%
is required in most cases to get a
 
01:44:22.470 --> 01:44:22.480 align:start position:0%
license um a big change on line 15 prior
 
01:44:23.830 --> 01:44:23.840 align:start position:0%
and currently
 
01:44:25.430 --> 01:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
uh because the bill that we passed out
 
01:44:27.550 --> 01:44:27.560 align:start position:0%
of the house amended uh the original
 
01:44:31.149 --> 01:44:31.159 align:start position:0%
1118 was interim studied in the Senate
 
01:44:34.030 --> 01:44:34.040 align:start position:0%
um changes the word from May to shall
 
01:44:36.350 --> 01:44:36.360 align:start position:0%
previously or currently I should say the
 
01:44:39.229 --> 01:44:39.239 align:start position:0%
word may still is there and under
 
01:44:41.390 --> 01:44:41.400 align:start position:0%
certain well depending on who's the
 
01:44:44.350 --> 01:44:44.360 align:start position:0%
director they may not uh look at any of
 
01:44:47.390 --> 01:44:47.400 align:start position:0%
the criteria that is spelled out in the
 
01:44:49.830 --> 01:44:49.840 align:start position:0%
statute for uh getting a driver's
 
01:44:51.669 --> 01:44:51.679 align:start position:0%
license New Hampshire driver's license
 
01:44:53.589 --> 01:44:53.599 align:start position:0%
so that word chain a sh
 
01:44:56.229 --> 01:44:56.239 align:start position:0%
and then you'll see a few changes um on
 
01:44:59.310 --> 01:44:59.320 align:start position:0%
those requirements that they shall
 
01:45:01.270 --> 01:45:01.280 align:start position:0%
consider um and a few changes to
 
01:45:03.669 --> 01:45:03.679 align:start position:0%
lettering because actually C on line 22
 
01:45:05.790 --> 01:45:05.800 align:start position:0%
was moved into
 
01:45:10.550 --> 01:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
line 18 uh etc etc so that was the
 
01:45:10.560 --> 01:45:13.070 align:start position:0%
line 18 uh etc etc so that was the
original

01:45:13.070 --> 01:45:13.080 align:start position:0%
original
 
01:45:15.950 --> 01:45:15.960 align:start position:0%
1118 during that whole period we were
 
01:45:17.950 --> 01:45:17.960 align:start position:0%
also watching the news every night like
 
01:45:20.109 --> 01:45:20.119 align:start position:0%
everybody else around the country
 
01:45:21.750 --> 01:45:21.760 align:start position:0%
watching what was going on at our
 
01:45:24.070 --> 01:45:24.080 align:start position:0%
borders watching the millions of people
 
01:45:27.310 --> 01:45:27.320 align:start position:0%
coming across the border every day and
 
01:45:29.189 --> 01:45:29.199 align:start position:0%
we started asking questions of the
 
01:45:30.750 --> 01:45:30.760 align:start position:0%
department on who's actually getting
 
01:45:32.510 --> 01:45:32.520 align:start position:0%
dri's licenses in the state of New
 
01:45:34.310 --> 01:45:34.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and we were told
 
01:45:37.070 --> 01:45:37.080 align:start position:0%
repeatedly the all nobody getting nobody
 
01:45:39.990 --> 01:45:40.000 align:start position:0%
in a pending case is getting a driver's
 
01:45:42.229 --> 01:45:42.239 align:start position:0%
license and this went on for months so
 
01:45:45.109 --> 01:45:45.119 align:start position:0%
okay that's as Fair as it can get it was
 
01:45:48.550 --> 01:45:48.560 align:start position:0%
later on that we were made aware that oh
 
01:45:50.750 --> 01:45:50.760 align:start position:0%
well if they get a temporary work
 
01:45:52.510 --> 01:45:52.520 align:start position:0%
authorization then of course they get a
 
01:45:55.109 --> 01:45:55.119 align:start position:0%
social security number which means now
 
01:45:56.669 --> 01:45:56.679 align:start position:0%
they can get an Hampshire driver's
 
01:45:58.950 --> 01:45:58.960 align:start position:0%
license and that's where the rest of the
 
01:46:02.070 --> 01:46:02.080 align:start position:0%
bill lines one and two and then lines
 
01:46:05.470 --> 01:46:05.480 align:start position:0%
26 through the balance of the bill came
 
01:46:08.510 --> 01:46:08.520 align:start position:0%
on 1118 as an
 
01:46:11.510 --> 01:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
amendment why would I do this and I'll
 
01:46:13.109 --> 01:46:13.119 align:start position:0%
get into the details of what it does in
 
01:46:16.550 --> 01:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
a minute fundamentally for
 
01:46:20.589 --> 01:46:20.599 align:start position:0%
me I realize and it's in statute that
 
01:46:22.390 --> 01:46:22.400 align:start position:0%
the ability to drive on the roads of New
 
01:46:24.310 --> 01:46:24.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is a privilege it's not a
 
01:46:26.390 --> 01:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
right contrary to what a lot of people
 
01:46:29.229 --> 01:46:29.239 align:start position:0%
say because we don't have uh you know
 
01:46:31.229 --> 01:46:31.239 align:start position:0%
mass transit and adequate public
 
01:46:33.189 --> 01:46:33.199 align:start position:0%
transportation it should be everybody's
 
01:46:35.669 --> 01:46:35.679 align:start position:0%
right to drive and that's not true it
 
01:46:37.390 --> 01:46:37.400 align:start position:0%
has not been changed driving is a
 
01:46:39.629 --> 01:46:39.639 align:start position:0%
privilege and I find it very unfair to
 
01:46:42.149 --> 01:46:42.159 align:start position:0%
the L biting citizens of this country
 
01:46:44.070 --> 01:46:44.080 align:start position:0%
that we just hand out driver's licenses
 
01:46:45.990 --> 01:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
to people that are currently claiming
 
01:46:47.950 --> 01:46:47.960 align:start position:0%
Asylum but have yet had their case
 
01:46:51.109 --> 01:46:51.119 align:start position:0%
adjudicated in in the immigration courts
 
01:46:54.669 --> 01:46:54.679 align:start position:0%
so that being said uh Alliance One and
 
01:46:58.350 --> 01:46:58.360 align:start position:0%
Two start the bill this version of it by
 
01:47:00.629 --> 01:47:00.639 align:start position:0%
saying that the people that have gotten
 
01:47:03.350 --> 01:47:03.360 align:start position:0%
gotten their license prior to the change
 
01:47:06.750 --> 01:47:06.760 align:start position:0%
shall not get it renewed simple
 
01:47:08.550 --> 01:47:08.560 align:start position:0%
enough and then when you get down to
 
01:47:11.229 --> 01:47:11.239 align:start position:0%
license uh L
 
01:47:11.239 --> 01:47:13.669 align:start position:0%
license uh L
27

01:47:13.669 --> 01:47:13.679 align:start position:0%
27
 
01:47:16.669 --> 01:47:16.679 align:start position:0%
um that's just recognizing that these
 
01:47:18.270 --> 01:47:18.280 align:start position:0%
licenses will not
 
01:47:21.149 --> 01:47:21.159 align:start position:0%
be uh used for State voter registration
 
01:47:22.390 --> 01:47:22.400 align:start position:0%
or any other the purposes related to
 
01:47:23.350 --> 01:47:23.360 align:start position:0%
local state
 
01:47:23.360 --> 01:47:24.709 align:start position:0%
local state
Federal

01:47:24.709 --> 01:47:24.719 align:start position:0%
Federal
 
01:47:28.350 --> 01:47:28.360 align:start position:0%
voting on page two of the
 
01:47:31.149 --> 01:47:31.159 align:start position:0%
bill um I'm just going through
 
01:47:34.589 --> 01:47:34.599 align:start position:0%
this uh line four is unchanged um line
 
01:47:36.790 --> 01:47:36.800 align:start position:0%
three is a new section this is where
 
01:47:40.870 --> 01:47:40.880 align:start position:0%
addressing the asiles um
 
01:47:43.550 --> 01:47:43.560 align:start position:0%
begins uh that's a new section uh what
 
01:47:45.070 --> 01:47:45.080 align:start position:0%
it says basically and I don't have to
 
01:47:48.350 --> 01:47:48.360 align:start position:0%
read it to you uh but what it says is
 
01:47:50.709 --> 01:47:50.719 align:start position:0%
that people who have claimed Asylum to
 
01:47:53.189 --> 01:47:53.199 align:start position:0%
get into the country will not not get a
 
01:47:55.550 --> 01:47:55.560 align:start position:0%
license even if they've been granted a
 
01:47:58.109 --> 01:47:58.119 align:start position:0%
temporary work authorization until they
 
01:48:00.390 --> 01:48:00.400 align:start position:0%
have gone through and completed their
 
01:48:02.669 --> 01:48:02.679 align:start position:0%
court cases through the immigration
 
01:48:04.550 --> 01:48:04.560 align:start position:0%
courts and become lawful Perman
 
01:48:04.560 --> 01:48:05.470 align:start position:0%
courts and become lawful Perman
permanent

01:48:05.470 --> 01:48:05.480 align:start position:0%
permanent
 
01:48:08.189 --> 01:48:08.199 align:start position:0%
citizens I think it's as Fair as it gets
 
01:48:10.189 --> 01:48:10.199 align:start position:0%
if there was a fairer way to do this I
 
01:48:12.669 --> 01:48:12.679 align:start position:0%
would look at it but I I can't you
 
01:48:15.669 --> 01:48:15.679 align:start position:0%
either agree that it's not fair to give
 
01:48:17.390 --> 01:48:17.400 align:start position:0%
people licenses that haven't even proven
 
01:48:21.149 --> 01:48:21.159 align:start position:0%
their illegally yet or not and I think
 
01:48:22.990 --> 01:48:23.000 align:start position:0%
some of the confusion that happened last
 
01:48:25.270 --> 01:48:25.280 align:start position:0%
year is the the difference between
 
01:48:28.870 --> 01:48:28.880 align:start position:0%
lawful presence and legally just to give
 
01:48:30.830 --> 01:48:30.840 align:start position:0%
you a quick one what what goes on at the
 
01:48:32.790 --> 01:48:32.800 align:start position:0%
border all what had been going on at the
 
01:48:34.030 --> 01:48:34.040 align:start position:0%
border although it's changed
 
01:48:36.589 --> 01:48:36.599 align:start position:0%
considerably at this point that anybody
 
01:48:39.990 --> 01:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
could come regardless of any third party
 
01:48:42.109 --> 01:48:42.119 align:start position:0%
agreement third safe country
 
01:48:44.510 --> 01:48:44.520 align:start position:0%
agreements anybody from any country on
 
01:48:46.430 --> 01:48:46.440 align:start position:0%
the planet was coming up to our Southern
 
01:48:49.350 --> 01:48:49.360 align:start position:0%
border and claiming
 
01:48:52.390 --> 01:48:52.400 align:start position:0%
Asylum they they have to go through not
 
01:48:54.550 --> 01:48:54.560 align:start position:0%
to mention the fact that they were also
 
01:48:56.589 --> 01:48:56.599 align:start position:0%
helped Along by some NOS I'd be curious
 
01:48:58.149 --> 01:48:58.159 align:start position:0%
to see how many of that those
 
01:48:59.910 --> 01:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
organizations were getting money from us
 
01:49:01.669 --> 01:49:01.679 align:start position:0%
aid but we'll look at that into the
 
01:49:03.830 --> 01:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
future so they were being en coached on
 
01:49:05.430 --> 01:49:05.440 align:start position:0%
the process and once they get into a
 
01:49:07.189 --> 01:49:07.199 align:start position:0%
Port of Entry uh the first thing they go
 
01:49:09.109 --> 01:49:09.119 align:start position:0%
through is a screening and they have to
 
01:49:11.310 --> 01:49:11.320 align:start position:0%
answer some basic questions if they
 
01:49:13.629 --> 01:49:13.639 align:start position:0%
answer those basic questions correctly
 
01:49:17.070 --> 01:49:17.080 align:start position:0%
uh they're then given an i589 which is a
 
01:49:17.080 --> 01:49:17.990 align:start position:0%
uh they're then given an i589 which is a
uh

01:49:17.990 --> 01:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:49:20.550 --> 01:49:20.560 align:start position:0%
basically the lawful presence that we
 
01:49:22.750 --> 01:49:22.760 align:start position:0%
talk about uh it just says you can't be
 
01:49:24.149 --> 01:49:24.159 align:start position:0%
deported while you're waiting to go
 
01:49:26.910 --> 01:49:26.920 align:start position:0%
through your Asylum hearings uh and not
 
01:49:29.109 --> 01:49:29.119 align:start position:0%
once they get to 589 their names
 
01:49:30.430 --> 01:49:30.440 align:start position:0%
whatever names they were provided get
 
01:49:32.470 --> 01:49:32.480 align:start position:0%
put into the safe database and then
 
01:49:34.350 --> 01:49:34.360 align:start position:0%
they're released into the interior of
 
01:49:36.709 --> 01:49:36.719 align:start position:0%
the country with hopes that they come
 
01:49:39.870 --> 01:49:39.880 align:start position:0%
back for their hearings of or their
 
01:49:42.470 --> 01:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
their cases at a at a later
 
01:49:45.350 --> 01:49:45.360 align:start position:0%
time um that's the nutshell and that's
 
01:49:46.910 --> 01:49:46.920 align:start position:0%
where the confusion was some people can
 
01:49:48.790 --> 01:49:48.800 align:start position:0%
say Well they're here legally well I
 
01:49:50.950 --> 01:49:50.960 align:start position:0%
contend they're not they're here with
 
01:49:52.870 --> 01:49:52.880 align:start position:0%
lawful presence to prove they're here
 
01:49:55.629 --> 01:49:55.639 align:start position:0%
legally and so all this bill does is
 
01:49:57.070 --> 01:49:57.080 align:start position:0%
instead of putting the C before the
 
01:49:59.270 --> 01:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
horse once you prove and you are here
 
01:50:01.030 --> 01:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
legally and you are not going to be
 
01:50:03.510 --> 01:50:03.520 align:start position:0%
asked to leave because you your your
 
01:50:04.589 --> 01:50:04.599 align:start position:0%
claim is
 
01:50:06.510 --> 01:50:06.520 align:start position:0%
illegitimate then then you can get a
 
01:50:09.390 --> 01:50:09.400 align:start position:0%
license not not before then to give them
 
01:50:11.709 --> 01:50:11.719 align:start position:0%
and just hand out our licenses prior to
 
01:50:13.830 --> 01:50:13.840 align:start position:0%
proof that you are here legally uh I
 
01:50:15.189 --> 01:50:15.199 align:start position:0%
don't think it's fair to the citizens
 
01:50:17.750 --> 01:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
and that's why I put this forward uh
 
01:50:20.229 --> 01:50:20.239 align:start position:0%
just to be honest with all of you uh
 
01:50:21.870 --> 01:50:21.880 align:start position:0%
obviously we put this in in November
 
01:50:23.629 --> 01:50:23.639 align:start position:0%
nobody knew what today was going to look
 
01:50:25.709 --> 01:50:25.719 align:start position:0%
like last month I was actually
 
01:50:27.270 --> 01:50:27.280 align:start position:0%
considering do we even still need this
 
01:50:30.350 --> 01:50:30.360 align:start position:0%
anymore maybe I should withdraw the bill
 
01:50:33.270 --> 01:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
and then our our our borders are and I
 
01:50:35.550 --> 01:50:35.560 align:start position:0%
hate that word but uh Tom Holman came
 
01:50:37.109 --> 01:50:37.119 align:start position:0%
out last month with with a pretty
 
01:50:39.470 --> 01:50:39.480 align:start position:0%
shattering statistic and after the
 
01:50:40.990 --> 01:50:41.000 align:start position:0%
research he's been doing and he's
 
01:50:43.189 --> 01:50:43.199 align:start position:0%
actually been doing this since
 
01:50:45.870 --> 01:50:45.880 align:start position:0%
1984 estimates that nine out of 10 of
 
01:50:47.830 --> 01:50:47.840 align:start position:0%
these Asylum claims are
 
01:50:49.550 --> 01:50:49.560 align:start position:0%
illegitimate that's
 
01:50:52.069 --> 01:50:52.079 align:start position:0%
90% that's all I needed to hear to keep
 
01:50:53.910 --> 01:50:53.920 align:start position:0%
this thing in motion and and I'm I'm
 
01:50:55.030 --> 01:50:55.040 align:start position:0%
hoping that the committee will see
 
01:50:57.629 --> 01:50:57.639 align:start position:0%
favorably pass it one more time and and
 
01:51:01.109 --> 01:51:01.119 align:start position:0%
put it to the house floor with that Mr
 
01:51:03.229 --> 01:51:03.239 align:start position:0%
chair I'll take any
 
01:51:06.870 --> 01:51:06.880 align:start position:0%
questions okay uh representative Hill
 
01:51:10.270 --> 01:51:10.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh quick question
 
01:51:13.069 --> 01:51:13.079 align:start position:0%
um when someone here that's lawfully
 
01:51:16.910 --> 01:51:16.920 align:start position:0%
present and applies for Asylum is
 
01:51:21.149 --> 01:51:21.159 align:start position:0%
denied um what do we do in New Hampshire
 
01:51:24.030 --> 01:51:24.040 align:start position:0%
um to revoke them license or do we do
 
01:51:26.550 --> 01:51:26.560 align:start position:0%
anything and does your bill do anything
 
01:51:28.870 --> 01:51:28.880 align:start position:0%
in that
 
01:51:31.750 --> 01:51:31.760 align:start position:0%
circumstance I do not know what they do
 
01:51:33.310 --> 01:51:33.320 align:start position:0%
if they're deported obviously then the
 
01:51:35.870 --> 01:51:35.880 align:start position:0%
license is negated this bill prevents
 
01:51:37.390 --> 01:51:37.400 align:start position:0%
them from getting them renewed
 
01:51:39.470 --> 01:51:39.480 align:start position:0%
specifically but in terms of an actual
 
01:51:41.149 --> 01:51:41.159 align:start position:0%
mechanism good question maybe it's
 
01:51:42.950 --> 01:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
something we can look at if they're
 
01:51:45.149 --> 01:51:45.159 align:start position:0%
denied their Asylum I mean granted they
 
01:51:47.229 --> 01:51:47.239 align:start position:0%
have to leave wow that's not necessarily
 
01:51:49.830 --> 01:51:49.840 align:start position:0%
true there's a whole appeal process as
 
01:51:52.910 --> 01:51:52.920 align:start position:0%
well so until they've exhausted all the
 
01:51:54.550 --> 01:51:54.560 align:start position:0%
appeals I would I would imagine the
 
01:51:56.229 --> 01:51:56.239 align:start position:0%
license would still be if they've been
 
01:51:58.310 --> 01:51:58.320 align:start position:0%
given one still be
 
01:52:01.189 --> 01:52:01.199 align:start position:0%
valid representative Miller thank you Mr
 
01:52:04.510 --> 01:52:04.520 align:start position:0%
chairman uh just want to make sure I
 
01:52:06.350 --> 01:52:06.360 align:start position:0%
understand your position on the
 
01:52:09.990 --> 01:52:10.000 align:start position:0%
definitions here um you're suggesting
 
01:52:13.229 --> 01:52:13.239 align:start position:0%
that someone who approaches the Border
 
01:52:15.510 --> 01:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
claims Asylum through the legal process
 
01:52:18.149 --> 01:52:18.159 align:start position:0%
established by the federal government is
 
01:52:19.790 --> 01:52:19.800 align:start position:0%
granted the paperwork is established by
 
01:52:22.589 --> 01:52:22.599 align:start position:0%
the federal government is in fact not
 
01:52:22.599 --> 01:52:23.750 align:start position:0%
the federal government is in fact not
here

01:52:23.750 --> 01:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:52:26.109 --> 01:52:26.119 align:start position:0%
legally it's a semantics it's a play
 
01:52:28.030 --> 01:52:28.040 align:start position:0%
with words and yes you are right has
 
01:52:29.790 --> 01:52:29.800 align:start position:0%
been said in the media by our vice
 
01:52:32.430 --> 01:52:32.440 align:start position:0%
president I believe the to be able to
 
01:52:34.430 --> 01:52:34.440 align:start position:0%
call somebody here lawfully present
 
01:52:37.669 --> 01:52:37.679 align:start position:0%
legal is like waving a magic wand you
 
01:52:39.629 --> 01:52:39.639 align:start position:0%
have to look into the words the the the
 
01:52:41.189 --> 01:52:41.199 align:start position:0%
document they get the
 
01:52:43.870 --> 01:52:43.880 align:start position:0%
i589 gives them permission to lawfully
 
01:52:45.589 --> 01:52:45.599 align:start position:0%
stay here while they're waiting for
 
01:52:49.390 --> 01:52:49.400 align:start position:0%
their case to be completed um so to me
 
01:52:51.189 --> 01:52:51.199 align:start position:0%
and you're right that's my opinion when
 
01:52:54.229 --> 01:52:54.239 align:start position:0%
you see you cannot be deported you're
 
01:52:56.270 --> 01:52:56.280 align:start position:0%
allowed to stay while you go to your
 
01:52:58.990 --> 01:52:59.000 align:start position:0%
Asylum case or or hearings to see if you
 
01:53:01.390 --> 01:53:01.400 align:start position:0%
are here legally and can stay legally
 
01:53:02.950 --> 01:53:02.960 align:start position:0%
because if you're not then they tell you
 
01:53:04.550 --> 01:53:04.560 align:start position:0%
you have to go once you go through the
 
01:53:07.950 --> 01:53:07.960 align:start position:0%
appeals process etc etc thank followup
 
01:53:11.470 --> 01:53:11.480 align:start position:0%
follow up um with respect specifically
 
01:53:14.430 --> 01:53:14.440 align:start position:0%
to Driver's Licenses we use them
 
01:53:17.390 --> 01:53:17.400 align:start position:0%
typically for identification and proof
 
01:53:20.109 --> 01:53:20.119 align:start position:0%
of I'll say education or qualification
 
01:53:23.550 --> 01:53:23.560 align:start position:0%
to operate a motor vehicle um is there
 
01:53:27.229 --> 01:53:27.239 align:start position:0%
any specifics about the person's legal
 
01:53:29.629 --> 01:53:29.639 align:start position:0%
status in the country that changes
 
01:53:31.870 --> 01:53:31.880 align:start position:0%
either their identification or their
 
01:53:33.069 --> 01:53:33.079 align:start position:0%
proof of their ability to operate a
 
01:53:34.629 --> 01:53:34.639 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle that suggest it needs to
 
01:53:37.270 --> 01:53:37.280 align:start position:0%
be revoked or not issued say that one
 
01:53:38.950 --> 01:53:38.960 align:start position:0%
more time I just want to make sure I get
 
01:53:40.550 --> 01:53:40.560 align:start position:0%
in your full full understand my
 
01:53:43.109 --> 01:53:43.119 align:start position:0%
understand generally speaking the reason
 
01:53:45.350 --> 01:53:45.360 align:start position:0%
driver's licenses are issued are twofold
 
01:53:46.709 --> 01:53:46.719 align:start position:0%
one is they can be used to demonstrate
 
01:53:50.030 --> 01:53:50.040 align:start position:0%
your identity and two is to demonstrate
 
01:53:51.709 --> 01:53:51.719 align:start position:0%
that you have satisfied the DMV's
 
01:53:53.550 --> 01:53:53.560 align:start position:0%
requirements and proof of ability to
 
01:53:57.910 --> 01:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
safely operate a motor vehicle does
 
01:54:03.149 --> 01:54:03.159 align:start position:0%
the immigration status of a person alter
 
01:54:05.310 --> 01:54:05.320 align:start position:0%
either their Identity or their ability
 
01:54:06.510 --> 01:54:06.520 align:start position:0%
to demonstrate that they can safely
 
01:54:08.510 --> 01:54:08.520 align:start position:0%
operate a motor vehicle on our roads
 
01:54:09.950 --> 01:54:09.960 align:start position:0%
which are the purposes of the license
 
01:54:11.030 --> 01:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
yeah well I'll agree with you on one
 
01:54:12.790 --> 01:54:12.800 align:start position:0%
thing when when licenses were first
 
01:54:14.510 --> 01:54:14.520 align:start position:0%
created that's all they were for was to
 
01:54:16.470 --> 01:54:16.480 align:start position:0%
prove that you had the ability to drive
 
01:54:18.149 --> 01:54:18.159 align:start position:0%
on the on on this on the roads of New
 
01:54:19.910 --> 01:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire since then obviously they've
 
01:54:21.709 --> 01:54:21.719 align:start position:0%
been morphed into our identification for
 
01:54:24.310 --> 01:54:24.320 align:start position:0%
everything and you are right uh things
 
01:54:26.229 --> 01:54:26.239 align:start position:0%
do change as they go through the process
 
01:54:28.910 --> 01:54:28.920 align:start position:0%
whether it be an asylum claim or
 
01:54:30.470 --> 01:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
permanent resident and once you get
 
01:54:32.069 --> 01:54:32.079 align:start position:0%
permanent residency and a social
 
01:54:34.189 --> 01:54:34.199 align:start position:0%
security number then you can move on to
 
01:54:36.310 --> 01:54:36.320 align:start position:0%
applying for citizenship and you're
 
01:54:37.470 --> 01:54:37.480 align:start position:0%
right I forgot to mention that in the
 
01:54:39.550 --> 01:54:39.560 align:start position:0%
last part of the bill it does I believe
 
01:54:43.109 --> 01:54:43.119 align:start position:0%
Roman four uh also add uh that
 
01:54:45.629 --> 01:54:45.639 align:start position:0%
denotation on the license and that's if
 
01:54:49.870 --> 01:54:49.880 align:start position:0%
you've got one legally um you know using
 
01:54:52.750 --> 01:54:52.760 align:start position:0%
some of the parameters on page one in
 
01:54:52.760 --> 01:54:53.830 align:start position:0%
some of the parameters on page one in
other

01:54:53.830 --> 01:54:53.840 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:54:55.910 --> 01:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
words for the purposes of attending
 
01:54:58.790 --> 01:54:58.800 align:start position:0%
public education institutions uh lawful
 
01:55:01.390 --> 01:55:01.400 align:start position:0%
employment uh spous are child of alien
 
01:55:03.830 --> 01:55:03.840 align:start position:0%
etc etc I hope that answers your
 
01:55:06.470 --> 01:55:06.480 align:start position:0%
question it did not thank you well I
 
01:55:08.550 --> 01:55:08.560 align:start position:0%
mean try you can if the chair will
 
01:55:10.830 --> 01:55:10.840 align:start position:0%
entertain I maybe try to rephrase it a
 
01:55:12.830 --> 01:55:12.840 align:start position:0%
little different you want to rephrase or
 
01:55:15.430 --> 01:55:15.440 align:start position:0%
think about it I will try one more time
 
01:55:19.030 --> 01:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
does the legal status of someone in the
 
01:55:21.910 --> 01:55:21.920 align:start position:0%
United States affect their ability to
 
01:55:23.669 --> 01:55:23.679 align:start position:0%
prove that they can safely operate a
 
01:55:26.109 --> 01:55:26.119 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle per the DMV that was easy
 
01:55:28.550 --> 01:55:28.560 align:start position:0%
no thank
 
01:55:31.990 --> 01:55:32.000 align:start position:0%
you representative V thank you Mr
 
01:55:33.390 --> 01:55:33.400 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
01:55:35.709 --> 01:55:35.719 align:start position:0%
question um there there are seven
 
01:55:37.669 --> 01:55:37.679 align:start position:0%
different at least seven different
 
01:55:40.310 --> 01:55:40.320 align:start position:0%
treaties and international agreements
 
01:55:42.709 --> 01:55:42.719 align:start position:0%
that govern how Asylum Seekers and
 
01:55:44.229 --> 01:55:44.239 align:start position:0%
refugees should be treated does this
 
01:55:47.669 --> 01:55:47.679 align:start position:0%
distinguish between uh a refugee and and
 
01:55:49.589 --> 01:55:49.599 align:start position:0%
an asylum Seeker because they're two
 
01:55:51.870 --> 01:55:51.880 align:start position:0%
different definitions but they both have
 
01:55:51.880 --> 01:55:53.270 align:start position:0%
different definitions but they both have
drawn

01:55:53.270 --> 01:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
drawn
 
01:55:55.990 --> 01:55:56.000 align:start position:0%
processes thank you for the question uh
 
01:55:59.550 --> 01:55:59.560 align:start position:0%
last year's version did have um refugees
 
01:56:01.510 --> 01:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
in it and I know that is one of the
 
01:56:03.069 --> 01:56:03.079 align:start position:0%
things the Senate did not like about it
 
01:56:05.229 --> 01:56:05.239 align:start position:0%
because it is a whole different it's a
 
01:56:07.589 --> 01:56:07.599 align:start position:0%
whole different approach or or process I
 
01:56:09.709 --> 01:56:09.719 align:start position:0%
should say uh generally speaking
 
01:56:11.629 --> 01:56:11.639 align:start position:0%
refugees or people seeking Refugee
 
01:56:13.910 --> 01:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
status actually requested in their
 
01:56:16.950 --> 01:56:16.960 align:start position:0%
country of origin U it's Asylum that
 
01:56:18.669 --> 01:56:18.679 align:start position:0%
usually happens when well you have to be
 
01:56:21.310 --> 01:56:21.320 align:start position:0%
on our soil before you can claim Asylum
 
01:56:23.790 --> 01:56:23.800 align:start position:0%
and just just so you know how how how in
 
01:56:26.430 --> 01:56:26.440 align:start position:0%
my opinion how abused this whole process
 
01:56:28.069 --> 01:56:28.079 align:start position:0%
was in the last four years we even heard
 
01:56:29.870 --> 01:56:29.880 align:start position:0%
from our department of motor vehicles
 
01:56:31.470 --> 01:56:31.480 align:start position:0%
that even people that we're gracious
 
01:56:33.510 --> 01:56:33.520 align:start position:0%
enough to give student visas vacation
 
01:56:36.270 --> 01:56:36.280 align:start position:0%
visas or tourist visas and sometimes
 
01:56:39.430 --> 01:56:39.440 align:start position:0%
work visas when those visas expired the
 
01:56:41.069 --> 01:56:41.079 align:start position:0%
previous administration was allowing
 
01:56:44.430 --> 01:56:44.440 align:start position:0%
people to claim Asylum then you know I
 
01:56:47.229 --> 01:56:47.239 align:start position:0%
mean I just it everybody should be
 
01:56:49.030 --> 01:56:49.040 align:start position:0%
outraged on what we saw for the last
 
01:56:51.189 --> 01:56:51.199 align:start position:0%
four years and this is just a in my
 
01:56:53.830 --> 01:56:53.840 align:start position:0%
opinion just just a a fair way to deal
 
01:56:55.910 --> 01:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
with who gets the privilege to drive in
 
01:56:55.920 --> 01:56:56.990 align:start position:0%
with who gets the privilege to drive in
this

01:56:56.990 --> 01:56:57.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:56:59.709 --> 01:56:59.719 align:start position:0%
state representative
 
01:57:02.550 --> 01:57:02.560 align:start position:0%
pataro thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:57:06.310 --> 01:57:06.320 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um I need to be
 
01:57:08.470 --> 01:57:08.480 align:start position:0%
brought up to speed I served on the
 
01:57:11.109 --> 01:57:11.119 align:start position:0%
transportation Committee in 2021 you
 
01:57:16.750 --> 01:57:16.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh hb1 1118 which um you said
 
01:57:19.790 --> 01:57:19.800 align:start position:0%
is in interim study in the Senate
 
01:57:22.870 --> 01:57:22.880 align:start position:0%
currently is that the case
 
01:57:24.270 --> 01:57:24.280 align:start position:0%
they put it thank you for the question
 
01:57:27.189 --> 01:57:27.199 align:start position:0%
they put an interim Study last term so
 
01:57:28.830 --> 01:57:28.840 align:start position:0%
essentially it's gone from the Senate
 
01:57:31.189 --> 01:57:31.199 align:start position:0%
now so just to just to give you an
 
01:57:32.990 --> 01:57:33.000 align:start position:0%
example the one of the people that had
 
01:57:34.750 --> 01:57:34.760 align:start position:0%
an issue with the word Refugee in the
 
01:57:35.910 --> 01:57:35.920 align:start position:0%
previous bill which is one of the
 
01:57:39.109 --> 01:57:39.119 align:start position:0%
reasons it went to interm study is now a
 
01:57:42.430 --> 01:57:42.440 align:start position:0%
senate co-sponsor so I believe that the
 
01:57:44.069 --> 01:57:44.079 align:start position:0%
small changes I made by eliminating
 
01:57:46.430 --> 01:57:46.440 align:start position:0%
those other two categories or that one
 
01:57:48.510 --> 01:57:48.520 align:start position:0%
category uh was sufficient enough for
 
01:57:51.310 --> 01:57:51.320 align:start position:0%
them to move forward with supporting it
 
01:57:53.350 --> 01:57:53.360 align:start position:0%
follow up Mr
 
01:57:57.550 --> 01:57:57.560 align:start position:0%
up between 2023 and now has something
 
01:57:58.830 --> 01:57:58.840 align:start position:0%
changed in New Hampshire where
 
01:58:01.030 --> 01:58:01.040 align:start position:0%
non-resident aliens can now get New
 
01:58:02.950 --> 01:58:02.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire driver's
 
01:58:05.870 --> 01:58:05.880 align:start position:0%
licenses no the big thing that changed
 
01:58:07.510 --> 01:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
was the
 
01:58:10.709 --> 01:58:10.719 align:start position:0%
urgency previous to I don't know if it
 
01:58:12.109 --> 01:58:12.119 align:start position:0%
was 23 or
 
01:58:15.430 --> 01:58:15.440 align:start position:0%
22 um the federal government would issue
 
01:58:17.310 --> 01:58:17.320 align:start position:0%
temporary work authorizations a year
 
01:58:18.830 --> 01:58:18.840 align:start position:0%
after somebody claimed Asylum through a
 
01:58:21.669 --> 01:58:21.679 align:start position:0%
Port of Entry then the urgency became
 
01:58:23.550 --> 01:58:23.560 align:start position:0%
National you remember hearing Governors
 
01:58:25.350 --> 01:58:25.360 align:start position:0%
across the country who were receiving
 
01:58:27.310 --> 01:58:27.320 align:start position:0%
large numbers of immigrants were were
 
01:58:28.790 --> 01:58:28.800 align:start position:0%
pleading with the federal government to
 
01:58:30.270 --> 01:58:30.280 align:start position:0%
start issuing the temporary work
 
01:58:33.229 --> 01:58:33.239 align:start position:0%
authorizations sooner we actually had
 
01:58:35.270 --> 01:58:35.280 align:start position:0%
many bills previous to that that were
 
01:58:37.510 --> 01:58:37.520 align:start position:0%
supposed to close the gap between the
 
01:58:40.189 --> 01:58:40.199 align:start position:0%
time when somebody filed for Asylum or
 
01:58:43.550 --> 01:58:43.560 align:start position:0%
claimed Asylum and waited that year for
 
01:58:45.669 --> 01:58:45.679 align:start position:0%
uh a temporary work authorization now
 
01:58:47.629 --> 01:58:47.639 align:start position:0%
keep in mind the only reason we're all
 
01:58:49.870 --> 01:58:49.880 align:start position:0%
here and even having this discussion is
 
01:58:52.990 --> 01:58:53.000 align:start position:0%
because we were we were it was allowed
 
01:58:55.430 --> 01:58:55.440 align:start position:0%
to have millions and millions of people
 
01:58:58.390 --> 01:58:58.400 align:start position:0%
come across the border this is Pain
 
01:59:00.109 --> 01:59:00.119 align:start position:0%
self-inflicted by the previous
 
01:59:02.350 --> 01:59:02.360 align:start position:0%
administration because the system is
 
01:59:04.550 --> 01:59:04.560 align:start position:0%
overwhelmed and I'll to be honest with
 
01:59:06.709 --> 01:59:06.719 align:start position:0%
you I don't even want to be doing this
 
01:59:10.149 --> 01:59:10.159 align:start position:0%
but in in my duty in my opinion to
 
01:59:12.510 --> 01:59:12.520 align:start position:0%
defend the fairness to the citizens of
 
01:59:13.790 --> 01:59:13.800 align:start position:0%
this state this is why I'm going to keep
 
01:59:15.430 --> 01:59:15.440 align:start position:0%
moving forward with this
 
01:59:19.470 --> 01:59:19.480 align:start position:0%
bill um and the unfortunate side of this
 
01:59:21.830 --> 01:59:21.840 align:start position:0%
is that yes unfortunately the people
 
01:59:23.990 --> 01:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
that are here legitimately with
 
01:59:26.109 --> 01:59:26.119 align:start position:0%
legitimate claims and just so you know
 
01:59:28.350 --> 01:59:28.360 align:start position:0%
to claim Asylum this is still statute
 
01:59:31.109 --> 01:59:31.119 align:start position:0%
this is still federal law you need to
 
01:59:33.270 --> 01:59:33.280 align:start position:0%
prove that anyone with legitimate fear
 
01:59:35.669 --> 01:59:35.679 align:start position:0%
of persecution based on race religion
 
01:59:37.629 --> 01:59:37.639 align:start position:0%
political views or membership in a
 
01:59:40.149 --> 01:59:40.159 align:start position:0%
particular quote unquote social group is
 
01:59:43.310 --> 01:59:43.320 align:start position:0%
the only reason for legitimate Asylum
 
01:59:47.510 --> 01:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
seeking a better life is not a reason a
 
01:59:49.270 --> 01:59:49.280 align:start position:0%
legitimate reason to claim asylum in the
 
01:59:51.750 --> 01:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
United States so unfortunately the
 
01:59:55.750 --> 01:59:55.760 align:start position:0%
people that are truly here um under the
 
01:59:57.990 --> 01:59:58.000 align:start position:0%
the definition of asylum seeking refu
 
02:00:01.149 --> 02:00:01.159 align:start position:0%
well not Refuge but seeking seeking a
 
02:00:03.669 --> 02:00:03.679 align:start position:0%
Asylum from these situations they're
 
02:00:05.669 --> 02:00:05.679 align:start position:0%
caught up in the same system and now
 
02:00:06.910 --> 02:00:06.920 align:start position:0%
based on the millions of people that
 
02:00:06.920 --> 02:00:07.870 align:start position:0%
based on the millions of people that
have

02:00:07.870 --> 02:00:07.880 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:00:11.229 --> 02:00:11.239 align:start position:0%
overwhelmed the uh the process I hear 8
 
02:00:13.189 --> 02:00:13.199 align:start position:0%
10 years before some of these people are
 
02:00:14.870 --> 02:00:14.880 align:start position:0%
going to be getting their day in in
 
02:00:17.550 --> 02:00:17.560 align:start position:0%
Immigration Court to prove their status
 
02:00:20.430 --> 02:00:20.440 align:start position:0%
with the prove they're legitimately here
 
02:00:22.189 --> 02:00:22.199 align:start position:0%
I don't know if that helps but
 
02:00:23.750 --> 02:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
tremendously thank you yeah
 
02:00:23.760 --> 02:00:25.950 align:start position:0%
tremendously thank you yeah
representative

02:00:25.950 --> 02:00:25.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:00:29.709 --> 02:00:29.719 align:start position:0%
Sykes yeah thank you Mr chairman uh
 
02:00:29.719 --> 02:00:32.550 align:start position:0%
Sykes yeah thank you Mr chairman uh
representative

02:00:32.550 --> 02:00:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:36.750 --> 02:00:36.760 align:start position:0%
Walsh do you have any um inkling of how
 
02:00:38.830 --> 02:00:38.840 align:start position:0%
many people in the last you you are
 
02:00:41.830 --> 02:00:41.840 align:start position:0%
correct that it takes 10 years perhaps
 
02:00:45.069 --> 02:00:45.079 align:start position:0%
to get your hearing do you have any uh
 
02:00:47.550 --> 02:00:47.560 align:start position:0%
knowledge of the numbers of as siles
 
02:00:49.669 --> 02:00:49.679 align:start position:0%
over the last 10 years who are currently
 
02:00:51.550 --> 02:00:51.560 align:start position:0%
driving and supporting their families
 
02:00:53.109 --> 02:00:53.119 align:start position:0%
would be
 
02:00:55.790 --> 02:00:55.800 align:start position:0%
affected by this
 
02:00:58.270 --> 02:00:58.280 align:start position:0%
bill I do not represent PES and it's
 
02:01:00.229 --> 02:01:00.239 align:start position:0%
unfortunate they may be caught up in
 
02:01:02.149 --> 02:01:02.159 align:start position:0%
this whole thing but once again this is
 
02:01:07.270 --> 02:01:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:07.280 --> 02:01:13.109 align:start position:0%
 
situation

02:01:13.109 --> 02:01:13.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:17.510 --> 02:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
follow representa G thank you Mr chair
 
02:01:18.629 --> 02:01:18.639 align:start position:0%
representative Walsh thank you for
 
02:01:19.589 --> 02:01:19.599 align:start position:0%
taking the question it's probably going
 
02:01:22.430 --> 02:01:22.440 align:start position:0%
to be the easiest one um
 
02:01:25.589 --> 02:01:25.599 align:start position:0%
so this would not change the way that
 
02:01:28.229 --> 02:01:28.239 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um acknowledges idps or
 
02:01:30.270 --> 02:01:30.280 align:start position:0%
International driving permits for
 
02:01:33.589 --> 02:01:33.599 align:start position:0%
tourists correct
 
02:01:36.870 --> 02:01:36.880 align:start position:0%
correct representative hemam uh thank
 
02:01:38.750 --> 02:01:38.760 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you representative
 
02:01:41.030 --> 02:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
Walch uh Ju Just on something entirely
 
02:01:46.229 --> 02:01:46.239 align:start position:0%
different on page two lines 19 and
 
02:01:49.510 --> 02:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
20 um it says the driver's license card
 
02:01:51.470 --> 02:01:51.480 align:start position:0%
shall bear a mark in indicating that
 
02:01:55.709 --> 02:01:55.719 align:start position:0%
it's not resident a driver's license um
 
02:01:57.390 --> 02:01:57.400 align:start position:0%
there's nothing that defines what kind
 
02:02:01.550 --> 02:02:01.560 align:start position:0%
of market so is there anything currently
 
02:02:03.270 --> 02:02:03.280 align:start position:0%
on the books that would define something
 
02:02:06.109 --> 02:02:06.119 align:start position:0%
like this or is this something that the
 
02:02:09.229 --> 02:02:09.239 align:start position:0%
director of the DMV would say put a
 
02:02:10.669 --> 02:02:10.679 align:start position:0%
little black dot on the back of the
 
02:02:12.550 --> 02:02:12.560 align:start position:0%
license when nobody notices
 
02:02:16.629 --> 02:02:16.639 align:start position:0%
it under RSA 541a under rules the
 
02:02:18.030 --> 02:02:18.040 align:start position:0%
department could establish what that
 
02:02:19.950 --> 02:02:19.960 align:start position:0%
symbol looks like thank
 
02:02:23.189 --> 02:02:23.199 align:start position:0%
you representative p command thank you
 
02:02:24.790 --> 02:02:24.800 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you representative
 
02:02:26.669 --> 02:02:26.679 align:start position:0%
wall for taking the question I'm just
 
02:02:28.109 --> 02:02:28.119 align:start position:0%
curious whether this is a really a
 
02:02:31.109 --> 02:02:31.119 align:start position:0%
national issue I do you know of any
 
02:02:33.310 --> 02:02:33.320 align:start position:0%
other states that have introduced
 
02:02:35.270 --> 02:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
similar uh
 
02:02:38.950 --> 02:02:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:41.350 --> 02:02:41.360 align:start position:0%
DMVs originally when I did my research I
 
02:02:43.270 --> 02:02:43.280 align:start position:0%
looked at what other states are doing I
 
02:02:44.990 --> 02:02:45.000 align:start position:0%
don't know that they're similar but yes
 
02:02:46.310 --> 02:02:46.320 align:start position:0%
there are many states that have been
 
02:02:48.830 --> 02:02:48.840 align:start position:0%
doing so things to address the same Pro
 
02:02:51.430 --> 02:02:51.440 align:start position:0%
the same problem specifically I don't
 
02:02:53.750 --> 02:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
have those in front of me but yes I
 
02:02:54.950 --> 02:02:54.960 align:start position:0%
believe it or not one of the most
 
02:02:56.790 --> 02:02:56.800 align:start position:0%
extreme ones I saw was a little State
 
02:02:58.790 --> 02:02:58.800 align:start position:0%
called Iowa and I was surprised to see
 
02:03:00.910 --> 02:03:00.920 align:start position:0%
they had one of the strictest proposed
 
02:03:03.310 --> 02:03:03.320 align:start position:0%
bills dealing with licenses um and
 
02:03:05.149 --> 02:03:05.159 align:start position:0%
they're not even technically on the
 
02:03:07.189 --> 02:03:07.199 align:start position:0%
borders of our country so yes it's all
 
02:03:08.350 --> 02:03:08.360 align:start position:0%
over the
 
02:03:10.430 --> 02:03:10.440 align:start position:0%
country any other questions from the
 
02:03:14.030 --> 02:03:14.040 align:start position:0%
committee not oh representative
 
02:03:17.109 --> 02:03:17.119 align:start position:0%
Miller one last followup I may uh you
 
02:03:19.589 --> 02:03:19.599 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh subsequent to our previous
 
02:03:22.069 --> 02:03:22.079 align:start position:0%
my prior questions uh keeping things
 
02:03:25.470 --> 02:03:25.480 align:start position:0%
Fair uh for residents of the State of
 
02:03:28.750 --> 02:03:28.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire citizens
 
02:03:32.470 --> 02:03:32.480 align:start position:0%
um is what is unfair about someone who
 
02:03:35.990 --> 02:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
is who has proven their ability to
 
02:03:39.270 --> 02:03:39.280 align:start position:0%
safely operate a motor vehicle doing so
 
02:03:40.990 --> 02:03:41.000 align:start position:0%
regardless of their
 
02:03:44.430 --> 02:03:44.440 align:start position:0%
citizenship as I said it is a privilege
 
02:03:46.229 --> 02:03:46.239 align:start position:0%
that the state of New Hampshire citizens
 
02:03:48.470 --> 02:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
hold dear and have to comply with all
 
02:03:50.990 --> 02:03:51.000 align:start position:0%
the laws that they do we have two bills
 
02:03:52.470 --> 02:03:52.480 align:start position:0%
specifically that are trying to take
 
02:03:55.149 --> 02:03:55.159 align:start position:0%
that away to keep that license I don't
 
02:03:56.830 --> 02:03:56.840 align:start position:0%
think it's fair that if you
 
02:03:59.430 --> 02:03:59.440 align:start position:0%
intentionally mislead or lie to get into
 
02:04:01.430 --> 02:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
this country based on an asylum claim
 
02:04:03.990 --> 02:04:04.000 align:start position:0%
that you know is not correct or not true
 
02:04:06.510 --> 02:04:06.520 align:start position:0%
to get that same privilege period that
 
02:04:08.149 --> 02:04:08.159 align:start position:0%
is why I'm doing this I am standing up
 
02:04:10.270 --> 02:04:10.280 align:start position:0%
for the people of the State uh it's
 
02:04:12.750 --> 02:04:12.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunate that the legitimate ases may
 
02:04:15.549 --> 02:04:15.559 align:start position:0%
get caught up in this thing but but I'm
 
02:04:18.549 --> 02:04:18.559 align:start position:0%
sorry if you said any untruths at your
 
02:04:20.830 --> 02:04:20.840 align:start position:0%
hearings or said any untruths to claim
 
02:04:22.750 --> 02:04:22.760 align:start position:0%
that you're an asy here even if you
 
02:04:25.310 --> 02:04:25.320 align:start position:0%
don't meet this definition that has been
 
02:04:28.350 --> 02:04:28.360 align:start position:0%
in law for years then you are complicit
 
02:04:29.470 --> 02:04:29.480 align:start position:0%
and I don't think you should get the
 
02:04:31.149 --> 02:04:31.159 align:start position:0%
privilege to drive in this
 
02:04:31.159 --> 02:04:33.990 align:start position:0%
privilege to drive in this
state

02:04:33.990 --> 02:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:04:36.870 --> 02:04:36.880 align:start position:0%
followup who gets to decide and when
 
02:04:40.830 --> 02:04:40.840 align:start position:0%
whether that lie or misstatement was
 
02:04:42.870 --> 02:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
made I told you they have to go through
 
02:04:44.350 --> 02:04:44.360 align:start position:0%
the immigration courts which
 
02:04:45.950 --> 02:04:45.960 align:start position:0%
unfortunately because of the millions of
 
02:04:49.310 --> 02:04:49.320 align:start position:0%
applications is years in delay and so I
 
02:04:51.709 --> 02:04:51.719 align:start position:0%
I I'm not going to take a position that
 
02:04:54.069 --> 02:04:54.079 align:start position:0%
just for the sake of a few uh legitimate
 
02:04:55.589 --> 02:04:55.599 align:start position:0%
ones we should give everybody one I
 
02:04:57.750 --> 02:04:57.760 align:start position:0%
don't think that's fair uh unfortunately
 
02:04:58.870 --> 02:04:58.880 align:start position:0%
the legitimate ones are going to get
 
02:05:00.149 --> 02:05:00.159 align:start position:0%
caught up waiting for the ones that
 
02:05:03.270 --> 02:05:03.280 align:start position:0%

represent hillsbor County District 40 I
 
02:05:46.870 --> 02:05:46.880 align:start position:0%
came here to strongly oppose HB 452 not
 
02:05:49.589 --> 02:05:49.599 align:start position:0%
just as a legislator but as someone who
 
02:05:51.910 --> 02:05:51.920 align:start position:0%
understands firsthand what it means to
 
02:05:53.589 --> 02:05:53.599 align:start position:0%
come to this country seeking a better
 
02:05:57.310 --> 02:05:57.320 align:start position:0%
life 16 years ago I arrived in the
 
02:05:59.910 --> 02:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
United States as Refugee after spending
 
02:06:04.310 --> 02:06:04.320 align:start position:0%
nearly 20 two decades in a refugee camp
 
02:06:06.589 --> 02:06:06.599 align:start position:0%
I'm always thankful and humbled for the
 
02:06:08.870 --> 02:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
support I was
 
02:06:12.390 --> 02:06:12.400 align:start position:0%
given I know what it is like to start
 
02:06:15.109 --> 02:06:15.119 align:start position:0%
over in a new country to work hard to
 
02:06:18.709 --> 02:06:18.719 align:start position:0%
rebuild alive from nothing and I know
 
02:06:21.629 --> 02:06:21.639 align:start position:0%
how I and I know that something as
 
02:06:24.310 --> 02:06:24.320 align:start position:0%
simple as driver's license can mean the
 
02:06:27.629 --> 02:06:27.639 align:start position:0%
difference between opportunity and
 
02:06:30.750 --> 02:06:30.760 align:start position:0%
struggle this bill targets people who
 
02:06:34.189 --> 02:06:34.199 align:start position:0%
are here legally students workers
 
02:06:37.109 --> 02:06:37.119 align:start position:0%
families people who are trying to do
 
02:06:40.069 --> 02:06:40.079 align:start position:0%
right thing it tells them that no matter
 
02:06:42.870 --> 02:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
how hard they work how much they
 
02:06:45.629 --> 02:06:45.639 align:start position:0%
contribute or How Deeply they want to be
 
02:06:49.069 --> 02:06:49.079 align:start position:0%
part of this state they are not welcome
 
02:06:52.589 --> 02:06:52.599 align:start position:0%
that's not the New Hampshire I know
 
02:06:55.229 --> 02:06:55.239 align:start position:0%
denying someone a driver's license
 
02:06:58.350 --> 02:06:58.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't stop them from needing to get to
 
02:07:01.189 --> 02:07:01.199 align:start position:0%
work or take their kids to school it
 
02:07:04.310 --> 02:07:04.320 align:start position:0%
just makes their lives harder it forces
 
02:07:07.109 --> 02:07:07.119 align:start position:0%
them into impossible choices either risk
 
02:07:09.669 --> 02:07:09.679 align:start position:0%
driving without a license or lose their
 
02:07:13.310 --> 02:07:13.320 align:start position:0%
job their education their future that is
 
02:07:16.790 --> 02:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
not Public Safety that is not fairness
 
02:07:20.270 --> 02:07:20.280 align:start position:0%
that is not who we are and let's talk
 
02:07:24.870 --> 02:07:24.880 align:start position:0%
about who this build effects it punishes
 
02:07:27.390 --> 02:07:27.400 align:start position:0%
ases people who have fled War
 
02:07:30.709 --> 02:07:30.719 align:start position:0%
persecution and unimaginable hardships
 
02:07:33.470 --> 02:07:33.480 align:start position:0%
by saying they must wait years for their
 
02:07:36.109 --> 02:07:36.119 align:start position:0%
status to adjust before they can even
 
02:07:39.310 --> 02:07:39.320 align:start position:0%
drive legally it punishes students who
 
02:07:41.790 --> 02:07:41.800 align:start position:0%
come here to learn workers who come here
 
02:07:44.310 --> 02:07:44.320 align:start position:0%
to feel critical labor shortages and the
 
02:07:46.189 --> 02:07:46.199 align:start position:0%
spouses and children of those who have
 
02:07:48.270 --> 02:07:48.280 align:start position:0%
already here already been granted
 
02:07:51.270 --> 02:07:51.280 align:start position:0%
permission to be here I want to remind
 
02:07:53.669 --> 02:07:53.679 align:start position:0%
this chamber that when I arrived in this
 
02:07:56.870 --> 02:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
country I had nothing but because this
 
02:07:59.629 --> 02:07:59.639 align:start position:0%
country gave me a chance because I was
 
02:08:03.549 --> 02:08:03.559 align:start position:0%
able to work to study and yes to drive I
 
02:08:06.149 --> 02:08:06.159 align:start position:0%
now stand before you as a state
 
02:08:08.549 --> 02:08:08.559 align:start position:0%
representative a business owner and a
 
02:08:11.709 --> 02:08:11.719 align:start position:0%
father raising my children in their in
 
02:08:14.549 --> 02:08:14.559 align:start position:0%
this great state this bill would take
 
02:08:17.109 --> 02:08:17.119 align:start position:0%
that opportunity away from people who
 
02:08:20.189 --> 02:08:20.199 align:start position:0%
just want to do what I did work hard and
 
02:08:22.310 --> 02:08:22.320 align:start position:0%
contribute to society
 
02:08:24.310 --> 02:08:24.320 align:start position:0%
and let's be clear this bill does not
 
02:08:28.030 --> 02:08:28.040 align:start position:0%
make our roads safe safer in fact it
 
02:08:30.669 --> 02:08:30.679 align:start position:0%
does the opposite when people are denied
 
02:08:33.629 --> 02:08:33.639 align:start position:0%
a driver's license they are also denied
 
02:08:36.750 --> 02:08:36.760 align:start position:0%
the ability to tested to get tested
 
02:08:38.990 --> 02:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
insured and held accountable under the
 
02:08:41.549 --> 02:08:41.559 align:start position:0%
law this bill would create more
 
02:08:44.310 --> 02:08:44.320 align:start position:0%
unlicensed uninsured drivers on our
 
02:08:48.950 --> 02:08:48.960 align:start position:0%
roads this is not Public Safety this is
 
02:08:51.629 --> 02:08:51.639 align:start position:0%
reckless New Hampshire has always always
 
02:08:53.910 --> 02:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
been a place that values hard work and
 
02:08:57.430 --> 02:08:57.440 align:start position:0%
fairness this bill goes against both it
 
02:08:59.390 --> 02:08:59.400 align:start position:0%
punishes the very people who want to
 
02:09:01.990 --> 02:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
follow the law who want to contribute
 
02:09:05.189 --> 02:09:05.199 align:start position:0%
and who want to be part of our
 
02:09:08.149 --> 02:09:08.159 align:start position:0%
communities I urge my colleagues look
 
02:09:12.189 --> 02:09:12.199 align:start position:0%
beyond the politics thank you the about
 
02:09:14.270 --> 02:09:14.280 align:start position:0%
think about the real people this bill
 
02:09:17.589 --> 02:09:17.599 align:start position:0%
would hurt I know because I was one of
 
02:09:22.030 --> 02:09:22.040 align:start position:0%
them what know on this Bill thank you
 
02:09:24.270 --> 02:09:24.280 align:start position:0%
thank you sir any questions from the
 
02:09:27.069 --> 02:09:27.079 align:start position:0%
committee representative Hill thank you
 
02:09:28.669 --> 02:09:28.679 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you for taking my
 
02:09:32.790 --> 02:09:32.800 align:start position:0%
question um you say that people want to
 
02:09:35.950 --> 02:09:35.960 align:start position:0%
come here and and follow the law and yet
 
02:09:38.629 --> 02:09:38.639 align:start position:0%
you're saying that they um if this bill
 
02:09:40.270 --> 02:09:40.280 align:start position:0%
were to pass that they will break the
 
02:09:45.910 --> 02:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
law and and I'm wondering if you can um
 
02:09:49.430 --> 02:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
resolve that dilemma I have for those
 
02:09:52.790 --> 02:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
two issues so
 
02:09:55.270 --> 02:09:55.280 align:start position:0%
so here we're talking about people who
 
02:09:57.950 --> 02:09:57.960 align:start position:0%
came here here legally like refugees
 
02:10:00.669 --> 02:10:00.679 align:start position:0%
ases and then when they're here you know
 
02:10:03.589 --> 02:10:03.599 align:start position:0%
well vered and why we not giving
 
02:10:06.149 --> 02:10:06.159 align:start position:0%
opportunity to apply for D license and
 
02:10:09.470 --> 02:10:09.480 align:start position:0%
get tested and drive in our roads so I
 
02:10:11.310 --> 02:10:11.320 align:start position:0%
think it is straightforward when they're
 
02:10:12.950 --> 02:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
here legally we should give them
 
02:10:17.350 --> 02:10:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:20.310 --> 02:10:20.320 align:start position:0%
license any other questions from the
 
02:10:23.270 --> 02:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
committee representative stclair thank
 
02:10:24.830 --> 02:10:24.840 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you
 
02:10:27.549 --> 02:10:27.559 align:start position:0%
representative do you have any idea just
 
02:10:30.030 --> 02:10:30.040 align:start position:0%
a if the numbers are out there of how
 
02:10:32.589 --> 02:10:32.599 align:start position:0%
many people that now have their
 
02:10:35.910 --> 02:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
license uh but have not achieved the
 
02:10:38.510 --> 02:10:38.520 align:start position:0%
final goal uh when they're not allowed
 
02:10:39.910 --> 02:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
to renew their license what kind of
 
02:10:41.750 --> 02:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
numbers are we talking about any any
 
02:10:44.510 --> 02:10:44.520 align:start position:0%
idea I don't have number representative
 
02:10:46.990 --> 02:10:47.000 align:start position:0%
at this time I don't
 
02:10:52.149 --> 02:10:52.159 align:start position:0%
know I would ask follow well with you
 
02:10:53.750 --> 02:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
um is that something that we could
 
02:10:55.149 --> 02:10:55.159 align:start position:0%
possibly get from the Department of
 
02:10:57.270 --> 02:10:57.280 align:start position:0%
Motor Vehicles I mean they must have
 
02:10:59.189 --> 02:10:59.199 align:start position:0%
some sort of handle on that I would
 
02:11:01.470 --> 02:11:01.480 align:start position:0%
think we can try to reach out and see we
 
02:11:04.629 --> 02:11:04.639 align:start position:0%
have nobody here from the DMV
 
02:11:07.310 --> 02:11:07.320 align:start position:0%
so thank
 
02:11:11.310 --> 02:11:11.320 align:start position:0%
you go ahead repres if I could be of
 
02:11:15.270 --> 02:11:15.280 align:start position:0%
assistance in this question um in
 
02:11:18.589 --> 02:11:18.599 align:start position:0%
previous years the testimony from DMV
 
02:11:22.830 --> 02:11:22.840 align:start position:0%
has been that there are approximately
 
02:11:22.840 --> 02:11:24.470 align:start position:0%
has been that there are approximately
um

02:11:24.470 --> 02:11:24.480 align:start position:0%

02:11:28.270 --> 02:11:28.280 align:start position:0%
15,000 driver licenses that are

bill who who are driving in this state
 
02:11:38.310 --> 02:11:38.320 align:start position:0%
now and how many of those would be
 
02:11:42.510 --> 02:11:42.520 align:start position:0%
affected probably is unknown but we are
 
02:11:47.549 --> 02:11:47.559 align:start position:0%

02:11:51.430 --> 02:11:51.440 align:start position:0%

02:13:10.549 --> 02:13:10.559 align:start position:0%
prohibits the issuance of driver's

have already been granted protection by
 
02:13:26.750 --> 02:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
an immigration judge making them legally

14.5 months to process these
 
02:13:46.830 --> 02:13:46.840 align:start position:0%
applications meaning that for more than
 
02:13:49.390 --> 02:13:49.400 align:start position:0%
two years after receiving Asylum status
 
02:13:51.270 --> 02:13:51.280 align:start position:0%
asiles would be prevented from driving
 
02:13:53.510 --> 02:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
under this bill denying them a driver's
 
02:13:54.990 --> 02:13:55.000 align:start position:0%
license would severely limit their
 
02:13:56.750 --> 02:13:56.760 align:start position:0%
ability to support themselves and their
 
02:13:59.270 --> 02:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
families access essential services and
 
02:14:02.069 --> 02:14:02.079 align:start position:0%
contribute to the state's economy ases
 
02:14:03.910 --> 02:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
differ from refugees in that they seek
 
02:14:05.870 --> 02:14:05.880 align:start position:0%
protection after arriving in the United
 
02:14:08.629 --> 02:14:08.639 align:start position:0%
States they may add students tourists
 
02:14:10.669 --> 02:14:10.679 align:start position:0%
businessmen or Parolees like the many
 
02:14:12.629 --> 02:14:12.639 align:start position:0%
Afghans who've placed the lives on their
 
02:14:14.589 --> 02:14:14.599 align:start position:0%
line for our country and now proudly
 
02:14:17.030 --> 02:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
call the gr at State home to qualify
 
02:14:19.149 --> 02:14:19.159 align:start position:0%
they must meet the legal definition of a
 
02:14:22.069 --> 02:14:22.079 align:start position:0%
refugee and undergo extensive vetting
 
02:14:24.350 --> 02:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
like refugees asiles are individuals who
 
02:14:26.069 --> 02:14:26.079 align:start position:0%
have fled their home countries to escape
 
02:14:28.510 --> 02:14:28.520 align:start position:0%
conflict violence or persecution and
 
02:14:30.790 --> 02:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
have sought safety in the United States
 
02:14:32.750 --> 02:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
under current New Hampshire law a valid
 
02:14:35.229 --> 02:14:35.239 align:start position:0%
EAD is required to obtain a driver's
 
02:14:38.030 --> 02:14:38.040 align:start position:0%
license asiles are legally authorized to
 
02:14:40.069 --> 02:14:40.079 align:start position:0%
work meaning they should continue to be
 
02:14:43.430 --> 02:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
eligible given that only 3% of New
 
02:14:44.629 --> 02:14:44.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents use public
 
02:14:46.830 --> 02:14:46.840 align:start position:0%
transportation driving is not a luxury
 
02:14:49.189 --> 02:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
but a necessity for accessing employment
 
02:14:51.030 --> 02:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
healthare and education restrict
 
02:14:52.790 --> 02:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
restricting access to driver's license
 
02:14:53.830 --> 02:14:53.840 align:start position:0%
would make it harder for these
 
02:14:55.390 --> 02:14:55.400 align:start position:0%
individuals to support themselves and
 
02:14:57.629 --> 02:14:57.639 align:start position:0%
integrate into the communities the
 
02:14:59.069 --> 02:14:59.079 align:start position:0%
individuals we serve are not
 
02:15:01.069 --> 02:15:01.079 align:start position:0%
undocumented immigrants they are legally
 
02:15:02.950 --> 02:15:02.960 align:start position:0%
recognized thoroughly vetted and on a
 
02:15:05.310 --> 02:15:05.320 align:start position:0%
path to permanent residency and eventual
 
02:15:08.390 --> 02:15:08.400 align:start position:0%
citizenship HB 452 though perhaps well
 
02:15:10.910 --> 02:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
intended cast too wide a net penalizing
 
02:15:12.629 --> 02:15:12.639 align:start position:0%
individuals following the legal process
 
02:15:13.990 --> 02:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
to build their lives in the Granite
 
02:15:16.109 --> 02:15:16.119 align:start position:0%
State this harms individuals and weakens
 
02:15:18.149 --> 02:15:18.159 align:start position:0%
the state's Workforce and economy thank
 
02:15:20.310 --> 02:15:20.320 align:start position:0%
you for your consideration I would also
 
02:15:22.030 --> 02:15:22.040 align:start position:0%
like to say in regard to the previous
 
02:15:24.430 --> 02:15:24.440 align:start position:0%
statements um that the driver's licenses
 
02:15:26.430 --> 02:15:26.440 align:start position:0%
can't be used for voting and that the
 
02:15:28.830 --> 02:15:28.840 align:start position:0%
issuance of the Eads is based on federal
 
02:15:31.229 --> 02:15:31.239 align:start position:0%
agency standards and that the state
 
02:15:33.229 --> 02:15:33.239 align:start position:0%
would not have the ability to restrict
 
02:15:37.189 --> 02:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
that um the bill also says asy so it's
 
02:15:38.510 --> 02:15:38.520 align:start position:0%
already been determined by an
 
02:15:40.549 --> 02:15:40.559 align:start position:0%
immigration judge or Asylum hearing
 
02:15:42.510 --> 02:15:42.520 align:start position:0%
officer that a person has been approved
 
02:15:44.990 --> 02:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
on their claim and they also as during
 
02:15:46.430 --> 02:15:46.440 align:start position:0%
that process have been background
 
02:15:50.069 --> 02:15:50.079 align:start position:0%
checked and vetted um also the i589
 
02:15:52.310 --> 02:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
previously referred to is the actual
 
02:15:54.910 --> 02:15:54.920 align:start position:0%
Asylum application it is not a separate
 
02:15:57.589 --> 02:15:57.599 align:start position:0%
document that either confers some sort
 
02:15:59.470 --> 02:15:59.480 align:start position:0%
of confirmation that the claim is
 
02:16:02.870 --> 02:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
recognized or not recognized um prior to
 
02:16:05.109 --> 02:16:05.119 align:start position:0%
that the person seeking entry into the
 
02:16:06.310 --> 02:16:06.320 align:start position:0%
United States is given what's called a
 
02:16:09.109 --> 02:16:09.119 align:start position:0%
credible fear interview and if they pass
 
02:16:10.750 --> 02:16:10.760 align:start position:0%
that they are allowed to go into the
 
02:16:13.270 --> 02:16:13.280 align:start position:0%
United States um but they are still in
 
02:16:14.669 --> 02:16:14.679 align:start position:0%
removal proceedings and must still
 
02:16:17.390 --> 02:16:17.400 align:start position:0%
approve their Asylum claim also for the
 
02:16:19.470 --> 02:16:19.480 align:start position:0%
purposes of refugee and asy it is the
 
02:16:21.350 --> 02:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
same legal standard it's just that one
 
02:16:23.629 --> 02:16:23.639 align:start position:0%
occurs in a third country outside of the
 
02:16:25.470 --> 02:16:25.480 align:start position:0%
United States and for an asy it occurs
 
02:16:29.189 --> 02:16:29.199 align:start position:0%
in the United States and I'm open to any
 
02:16:31.109 --> 02:16:31.119 align:start position:0%
questioning any questions from the
 
02:16:34.190 --> 02:16:34.200 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
02:16:36.389 --> 02:16:36.399 align:start position:0%
Crawford thank you Mr chairman could you
 
02:16:38.429 --> 02:16:38.439 align:start position:0%
tell me you made the statement that um
 
02:16:41.990 --> 02:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
they cannot use that license for voting
 
02:16:44.750 --> 02:16:44.760 align:start position:0%
how would a ballot clerk know that if it
 
02:16:46.629 --> 02:16:46.639 align:start position:0%
was presented to
 
02:16:48.709 --> 02:16:48.719 align:start position:0%
them I don't know what your ballot
 
02:16:50.990 --> 02:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
Clerk's standards would be for that but
 
02:16:52.950 --> 02:16:52.960 align:start position:0%
but the presence of the uh driver's
 
02:16:54.509 --> 02:16:54.519 align:start position:0%
license is as previously stated by
 
02:16:56.230 --> 02:16:56.240 align:start position:0%
representative Miller used to determine
 
02:16:57.830 --> 02:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
whether or not they can safely operate a
 
02:17:02.110 --> 02:17:02.120 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle um so I don't think their
 
02:17:03.830 --> 02:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
status in the United States is
 
02:17:05.270 --> 02:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
reflective of
 
02:17:08.790 --> 02:17:08.800 align:start position:0%
that okay thank you representative
 
02:17:10.910 --> 02:17:10.920 align:start position:0%
V thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
02:17:13.429 --> 02:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I assume that
 
02:17:15.589 --> 02:17:15.599 align:start position:0%
something like this would pretty quickly
 
02:17:18.429 --> 02:17:18.439 align:start position:0%
trigger lawsuits it if it went went into
 
02:17:20.389 --> 02:17:20.399 align:start position:0%
effect has this been adjudicated in any
 
02:17:21.950 --> 02:17:21.960 align:start position:0%
other state have any of the states tried
 
02:17:24.669 --> 02:17:24.679 align:start position:0%
to do this and and had the case heard in
 
02:17:26.790 --> 02:17:26.800 align:start position:0%
court and what was the result to my
 
02:17:30.309 --> 02:17:30.319 align:start position:0%
knowledge No in fact the um Iowa bill is
 
02:17:32.030 --> 02:17:32.040 align:start position:0%
a proposed Bill similar to the bill that
 
02:17:35.110 --> 02:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
we have here it would immediately um
 
02:17:39.669 --> 02:17:39.679 align:start position:0%
be subject to a lawsuit by other um
 
02:17:41.950 --> 02:17:41.960 align:start position:0%
organizations um for the sheer fact that
 
02:17:44.950 --> 02:17:44.960 align:start position:0%
the rules governing it are federal rules
 
02:17:46.549 --> 02:17:46.559 align:start position:0%
and those Federal rules would Trump the
 
02:17:46.559 --> 02:17:49.110 align:start position:0%
and those Federal rules would Trump the
state

02:17:49.110 --> 02:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:51.389 --> 02:17:51.399 align:start position:0%
rules representative Hill
 
02:17:52.709 --> 02:17:52.719 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
02:17:54.669 --> 02:17:54.679 align:start position:0%
taking my question and coming before us
 
02:17:57.790 --> 02:17:57.800 align:start position:0%
today um you mentioned an extensive
 
02:17:59.629 --> 02:17:59.639 align:start position:0%
background check in vetting process can
 
02:18:01.309 --> 02:18:01.319 align:start position:0%
you explain that to
 
02:18:04.990 --> 02:18:05.000 align:start position:0%
me yes uh there is a Biometrics a series
 
02:18:06.549 --> 02:18:06.559 align:start position:0%
of Biometrics information that uh
 
02:18:09.790 --> 02:18:09.800 align:start position:0%
refugees and asiles have to uh submit to
 
02:18:11.150 --> 02:18:11.160 align:start position:0%
and then that is cross referenced and
 
02:18:12.790 --> 02:18:12.800 align:start position:0%
checked across several other government
 
02:18:14.790 --> 02:18:14.800 align:start position:0%
agencies there are seven in total but
 
02:18:16.509 --> 02:18:16.519 align:start position:0%
including uh Department of Homeland
 
02:18:19.589 --> 02:18:19.599 align:start position:0%
Security um ATF I can get you the entire
 
02:18:20.870 --> 02:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
list but there are seven different
 
02:18:23.270 --> 02:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
agencies that will background check um
 
02:18:25.349 --> 02:18:25.359 align:start position:0%
in both the United States and uh the
 
02:18:27.549 --> 02:18:27.559 align:start position:0%
person's Home Country to see whether or
 
02:18:29.549 --> 02:18:29.559 align:start position:0%
not there have been convictions and even
 
02:18:32.070 --> 02:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
during the asy process and the refugee
 
02:18:33.870 --> 02:18:33.880 align:start position:0%
process you have to disclose not only if
 
02:18:35.910 --> 02:18:35.920 align:start position:0%
you were convicted of a crime but also
 
02:18:37.830 --> 02:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
if you were ever charged with a crime if
 
02:18:39.190 --> 02:18:39.200 align:start position:0%
you've ever committed if you've ever
 
02:18:40.469 --> 02:18:40.479 align:start position:0%
committed a crime for which you've never
 
02:18:42.150 --> 02:18:42.160 align:start position:0%
been charged so there are variety of
 
02:18:43.830 --> 02:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
different questions that go into that
 
02:18:45.629 --> 02:18:45.639 align:start position:0%
and again the determination that stated
 
02:18:48.389 --> 02:18:48.399 align:start position:0%
previously um with if someone presented
 
02:18:50.230 --> 02:18:50.240 align:start position:0%
a case of fraud where their claim wasn't
 
02:18:52.589 --> 02:18:52.599 align:start position:0%
the that is within the purview of the
 
02:18:55.469 --> 02:18:55.479 align:start position:0%
Asylum judge um which again is a federal
 
02:18:55.479 --> 02:18:56.870 align:start position:0%
Asylum judge um which again is a federal
agency

02:18:56.870 --> 02:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
agency
 
02:19:00.870 --> 02:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
position paa thank you um through that
 
02:19:06.190 --> 02:19:06.200 align:start position:0%
process if if anything pops up um then
 
02:19:06.200 --> 02:19:07.110 align:start position:0%
process if if anything pops up um then
what

02:19:07.110 --> 02:19:07.120 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:19:09.110 --> 02:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
happens if something were to pop up
 
02:19:10.750 --> 02:19:10.760 align:start position:0%
during that time it would be brought up
 
02:19:13.950 --> 02:19:13.960 align:start position:0%
during that Asylum hearing um the person
 
02:19:16.309 --> 02:19:16.319 align:start position:0%
would not be granted Asylum or if for
 
02:19:17.589 --> 02:19:17.599 align:start position:0%
some reason could be granted a
 
02:19:19.910 --> 02:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
withholding of removal um but it would
 
02:19:21.629 --> 02:19:21.639 align:start position:0%
absolutely be brought up during that
 
02:19:23.589 --> 02:19:23.599 align:start position:0%
removal hearing because even though the
 
02:19:25.230 --> 02:19:25.240 align:start position:0%
person is claiming Asylum it's a
 
02:19:26.990 --> 02:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
defensive Asylum and it's still a
 
02:19:28.509 --> 02:19:28.519 align:start position:0%
removal proceeding the government is
 
02:19:30.589 --> 02:19:30.599 align:start position:0%
still moving to remove that person so
 
02:19:32.629 --> 02:19:32.639 align:start position:0%
that absolutely would come up and the
 
02:19:35.790 --> 02:19:35.800 align:start position:0%
Department of Homeland Security um we
 
02:19:40.030 --> 02:19:40.040 align:start position:0%
call them acc's um assistant um ACC
 
02:19:41.629 --> 02:19:41.639 align:start position:0%
assistant chief counsels um they would
 
02:19:43.110 --> 02:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
have access to that and they would put
 
02:19:45.950 --> 02:19:45.960 align:start position:0%
it on the record during that
 
02:19:48.950 --> 02:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
hearing one more followup thank you does
 
02:19:52.150 --> 02:19:52.160 align:start position:0%
that mean that they are not able to stay
 
02:19:54.110 --> 02:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
are they deported at that point what
 
02:19:55.710 --> 02:19:55.720 align:start position:0%
happens then it depends it depends on
 
02:19:57.950 --> 02:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
the fact and Circumstance of each case
 
02:20:00.150 --> 02:20:00.160 align:start position:0%
um you could have your Asylum claim
 
02:20:02.270 --> 02:20:02.280 align:start position:0%
denied but depending on what happened in
 
02:20:03.469 --> 02:20:03.479 align:start position:0%
that previous country you could be
 
02:20:05.270 --> 02:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
subject to what's called a withholding
 
02:20:07.349 --> 02:20:07.359 align:start position:0%
of removal from the convention Against
 
02:20:09.630 --> 02:20:09.640 align:start position:0%
torture or just a withholding of removal
 
02:20:11.230 --> 02:20:11.240 align:start position:0%
so the way that it looks on the record
 
02:20:13.710 --> 02:20:13.720 align:start position:0%
is that you're removable but they
 
02:20:15.429 --> 02:20:15.439 align:start position:0%
withhold it based on something that's
 
02:20:17.270 --> 02:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
happened but it's unlikely if you had
 
02:20:19.630 --> 02:20:19.640 align:start position:0%
like say I terrorism gang related
 
02:20:21.150 --> 02:20:21.160 align:start position:0%
charges drug offenses
 
02:20:23.429 --> 02:20:23.439 align:start position:0%
um in your home country that that would
 
02:20:25.910 --> 02:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
be something that they wouldn't remove
 
02:20:29.670 --> 02:20:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:32.870 --> 02:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
removable representative hblm uh thank
 
02:20:34.590 --> 02:20:34.600 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair uh thank you for being here
 
02:20:38.990 --> 02:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
today so um as I listen to you and read
 
02:20:43.270 --> 02:20:43.280 align:start position:0%
your uh testimony is your position that
 
02:20:46.150 --> 02:20:46.160 align:start position:0%
driver's licensees are very important to
 
02:20:49.550 --> 02:20:49.560 align:start position:0%
these people Etc um in which I
 
02:20:50.990 --> 02:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
understand what you're saying and
 
02:20:55.110 --> 02:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
everything uh just a hypothetical um say
 
02:20:57.990 --> 02:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
someone had a licensed person in that
 
02:21:01.070 --> 02:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
status had a license and they were
 
02:21:03.990 --> 02:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
stopped by the police for an O oui
 
02:21:06.910 --> 02:21:06.920 align:start position:0%
charge and they were to lose their
 
02:21:09.110 --> 02:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
license they have the
 
02:21:09.120 --> 02:21:11.270 align:start position:0%
license they have the
same

02:21:11.270 --> 02:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
same
 
02:21:15.389 --> 02:21:15.399 align:start position:0%
hypothetical um uh hardships so would it
 
02:21:16.990 --> 02:21:17.000 align:start position:0%
be your position they cannot lose their
 
02:21:19.030 --> 02:21:19.040 align:start position:0%
license for
 
02:21:21.910 --> 02:21:21.920 align:start position:0%
oi no person who is uh charged with an
 
02:21:23.389 --> 02:21:23.399 align:start position:0%
oui would still be subject to the state
 
02:21:26.550 --> 02:21:26.560 align:start position:0%
laws of if if anyone is charged with an
 
02:21:28.830 --> 02:21:28.840 align:start position:0%
oui and you have your license removed
 
02:21:30.469 --> 02:21:30.479 align:start position:0%
for a period of time it doesn't revoke
 
02:21:32.070 --> 02:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
their employment authorization document
 
02:21:33.830 --> 02:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
card because there's two separate
 
02:21:36.630 --> 02:21:36.640 align:start position:0%
determinations um so a person who is
 
02:21:38.670 --> 02:21:38.680 align:start position:0%
charged regardless of their legal status
 
02:21:40.590 --> 02:21:40.600 align:start position:0%
um in the United States would still be
 
02:21:42.870 --> 02:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
subject to having their license um
 
02:21:45.030 --> 02:21:45.040 align:start position:0%
removed for that for whatever period of
 
02:21:47.110 --> 02:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
time is already prescribed um under the
 
02:21:47.120 --> 02:21:47.910 align:start position:0%
time is already prescribed um under the
state

02:21:47.910 --> 02:21:47.920 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:21:50.790 --> 02:21:50.800 align:start position:0%
laws regardless of the hardship would
 
02:21:52.830 --> 02:21:52.840 align:start position:0%
cause them it would it would certainly
 
02:21:54.630 --> 02:21:54.640 align:start position:0%
cause them a hardship however I believe
 
02:21:55.630 --> 02:21:55.640 align:start position:0%
that that's a balancing that the
 
02:21:57.150 --> 02:21:57.160 align:start position:0%
legislature has between the safety to
 
02:22:00.830 --> 02:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
the community and um you know their
 
02:22:02.389 --> 02:22:02.399 align:start position:0%
ability to operate because as previously
 
02:22:03.510 --> 02:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
stated it's not a right to have a
 
02:22:05.670 --> 02:22:05.680 align:start position:0%
driver's license but a privilege um
 
02:22:07.550 --> 02:22:07.560 align:start position:0%
however there are certain standards that
 
02:22:09.190 --> 02:22:09.200 align:start position:0%
govern the issuing of that license in
 
02:22:10.389 --> 02:22:10.399 align:start position:0%
the first place it doesn't mean that the
 
02:22:12.710 --> 02:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
license can't be suspended for whatever
 
02:22:14.870 --> 02:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
period of time or reinstated after the
 
02:22:17.590 --> 02:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
period of suspension is over thank you
 
02:22:20.830 --> 02:22:20.840 align:start position:0%
representative Sykes
 
02:22:22.910 --> 02:22:22.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
02:22:25.910 --> 02:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question I I just want to uh
 
02:22:28.910 --> 02:22:28.920 align:start position:0%
drill down a little bit to some previous
 
02:22:28.920 --> 02:22:30.710 align:start position:0%
drill down a little bit to some previous
testimony

02:22:30.710 --> 02:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
02:22:33.670 --> 02:22:33.680 align:start position:0%
um previous testimony suggested that
 
02:22:39.270 --> 02:22:39.280 align:start position:0%
nine out of 10 ases were uh not here not
 
02:22:42.270 --> 02:22:42.280 align:start position:0%
we're we're not telling the truth C can
 
02:22:45.790 --> 02:22:45.800 align:start position:0%
you confirm or give further explanation
 
02:22:49.670 --> 02:22:49.680 align:start position:0%
about that statistic because I I find it
 
02:22:52.150 --> 02:22:52.160 align:start position:0%
I I just want
 
02:22:54.750 --> 02:22:54.760 align:start position:0%
I cannot give any Credence to that I can
 
02:22:57.429 --> 02:22:57.439 align:start position:0%
tell you that unrepresented individuals
 
02:23:00.150 --> 02:23:00.160 align:start position:0%
who go before immigration judges are
 
02:23:03.030 --> 02:23:03.040 align:start position:0%
significantly less likely to uh Prevail
 
02:23:05.110 --> 02:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
on their Asylum claims and that is due
 
02:23:07.790 --> 02:23:07.800 align:start position:0%
to a multiplicity of factors um not the
 
02:23:11.110 --> 02:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
foremost being it is a quad it is not
 
02:23:12.510 --> 02:23:12.520 align:start position:0%
the same the Immigration Court that
 
02:23:14.590 --> 02:23:14.600 align:start position:0%
they're proceeding it is a federal
 
02:23:17.670 --> 02:23:17.680 align:start position:0%
agency Court um so it is not the same as
 
02:23:19.110 --> 02:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
an article three court which is what
 
02:23:20.550 --> 02:23:20.560 align:start position:0%
everyone is familiar with it's
 
02:23:21.790 --> 02:23:21.800 align:start position:0%
established by the United States
 
02:23:23.870 --> 02:23:23.880 align:start position:0%
Constitution be it a federal or a state
 
02:23:25.990 --> 02:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
court um but there are still rules of
 
02:23:28.190 --> 02:23:28.200 align:start position:0%
procedure and evidence that are required
 
02:23:30.830 --> 02:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
during that time and legal standards
 
02:23:32.710 --> 02:23:32.720 align:start position:0%
that govern whether or not Asylum can be
 
02:23:35.030 --> 02:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
granted and your average Asylum Seeker
 
02:23:36.990 --> 02:23:37.000 align:start position:0%
uh with no legal background isn't privy
 
02:23:38.910 --> 02:23:38.920 align:start position:0%
to those cases or the case law that they
 
02:23:42.230 --> 02:23:42.240 align:start position:0%
should be arguing um so ones that F ones
 
02:23:44.110 --> 02:23:44.120 align:start position:0%
that have uh legal represented Council
 
02:23:46.550 --> 02:23:46.560 align:start position:0%
are more likely to succeed but I cannot
 
02:23:50.030 --> 02:23:50.040 align:start position:0%
say at all that there's any Credence to
 
02:23:52.190 --> 02:23:52.200 align:start position:0%
uh the statement that nine out of 10 are
 
02:23:54.510 --> 02:23:54.520 align:start position:0%
fraudulent or in some way false they may
 
02:23:56.349 --> 02:23:56.359 align:start position:0%
not Prevail but that could be based on
 
02:23:58.710 --> 02:23:58.720 align:start position:0%
any number of other um
 
02:24:02.030 --> 02:24:02.040 align:start position:0%
instances thank you representative
 
02:24:04.309 --> 02:24:04.319 align:start position:0%
pataro thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:24:06.150 --> 02:24:06.160 align:start position:0%
for taking my
 
02:24:08.630 --> 02:24:08.640 align:start position:0%
question is a non-resident alien the
 
02:24:12.269 --> 02:24:12.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:15.550 --> 02:24:15.560 align:start position:0%
alien it depends on how you want to
 
02:24:18.550 --> 02:24:18.560 align:start position:0%
describe it when you say illegal alien
 
02:24:20.389 --> 02:24:20.399 align:start position:0%
the word alien is something that is used
 
02:24:23.349 --> 02:24:23.359 align:start position:0%
used in federal statutes to describe a
 
02:24:27.190 --> 02:24:27.200 align:start position:0%
person uh who has not who is not a US
 
02:24:30.030 --> 02:24:30.040 align:start position:0%
citizen um
 
02:24:34.429 --> 02:24:34.439 align:start position:0%
so nonresident alien I would suppose um
 
02:24:36.110 --> 02:24:36.120 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of this bill could be
 
02:24:38.710 --> 02:24:38.720 align:start position:0%
anyone who
 
02:24:42.550 --> 02:24:42.560 align:start position:0%
um does not have their US citizenship
 
02:24:44.910 --> 02:24:44.920 align:start position:0%
that I think is the best way that I
 
02:24:46.790 --> 02:24:46.800 align:start position:0%
could describe it we we tend not to use
 
02:24:48.990 --> 02:24:49.000 align:start position:0%
the word um illegal alien when we're
 
02:24:53.429 --> 02:24:53.439 align:start position:0%
talking um in our agency about
 
02:24:55.269 --> 02:24:55.279 align:start position:0%
individuals uh because they're people
 
02:24:55.279 --> 02:24:56.550 align:start position:0%
individuals uh because they're people
and

02:24:56.550 --> 02:24:56.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:24:59.389 --> 02:24:59.399 align:start position:0%
because a person's immigration status is
 
02:25:01.670 --> 02:25:01.680 align:start position:0%
so subject to fluctuation and change for
 
02:25:02.910 --> 02:25:02.920 align:start position:0%
example with the employment
 
02:25:05.309 --> 02:25:05.319 align:start position:0%
authorization document cards you can
 
02:25:07.070 --> 02:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
have more than one employment
 
02:25:08.990 --> 02:25:09.000 align:start position:0%
authorization document card for more
 
02:25:11.230 --> 02:25:11.240 align:start position:0%
than one category all of the EAD cards
 
02:25:14.550 --> 02:25:14.560 align:start position:0%
have category codes on them that list
 
02:25:17.150 --> 02:25:17.160 align:start position:0%
what your lawful status is so for
 
02:25:19.830 --> 02:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
example a lot of the Afghan citizens uh
 
02:25:22.830 --> 02:25:22.840 align:start position:0%
that we assisted have an initial
 
02:25:25.030 --> 02:25:25.040 align:start position:0%
humanitarian parole category code
 
02:25:26.309 --> 02:25:26.319 align:start position:0%
because they were paroled in for
 
02:25:28.590 --> 02:25:28.600 align:start position:0%
humanitarian purposes then also
 
02:25:30.349 --> 02:25:30.359 align:start position:0%
Afghanistan is listed as a temporary
 
02:25:32.630 --> 02:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
protected status country by Congress so
 
02:25:35.750 --> 02:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
you can have an EAD card for that
 
02:25:37.910 --> 02:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
category temporary protected status you
 
02:25:39.750 --> 02:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
can also have one and also um I just
 
02:25:42.230 --> 02:25:42.240 align:start position:0%
wanted to say uh just to correct a point
 
02:25:45.389 --> 02:25:45.399 align:start position:0%
that Ayes are entitled after 180 days to
 
02:25:47.150 --> 02:25:47.160 align:start position:0%
apply for the EAD cards it's not after
 
02:25:50.950 --> 02:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
one year um so
 
02:25:53.309 --> 02:25:53.319 align:start position:0%
the term illegal alien not non-resident
 
02:25:55.870 --> 02:25:55.880 align:start position:0%
alien I don't think it really gets to
 
02:25:57.349 --> 02:25:57.359 align:start position:0%
the status of a person that you're
 
02:26:00.550 --> 02:26:00.560 align:start position:0%
trying to categorize followup Mr chair
 
02:26:02.710 --> 02:26:02.720 align:start position:0%
followup uh thank you for that very
 
02:26:04.469 --> 02:26:04.479 align:start position:0%
thorough answer I really do appreciate
 
02:26:06.349 --> 02:26:06.359 align:start position:0%
it my followup
 
02:26:10.950 --> 02:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
is does asentria represent only refugees
 
02:26:15.150 --> 02:26:15.160 align:start position:0%
and Ayes but not illegal
 
02:26:19.110 --> 02:26:19.120 align:start position:0%
aliens again I I would I would ask for
 
02:26:21.230 --> 02:26:21.240 align:start position:0%
your definition of what an legal alien
 
02:26:24.070 --> 02:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
is the bill talks about a nonresident
 
02:26:26.750 --> 02:26:26.760 align:start position:0%
alien do you so once again does the
 
02:26:30.870 --> 02:26:30.880 align:start position:0%
centria represent refugees and Ayes but
 
02:26:33.469 --> 02:26:33.479 align:start position:0%
not non-resident
 
02:26:36.750 --> 02:26:36.760 align:start position:0%
aliens um I'm very very sorry I don't
 
02:26:38.510 --> 02:26:38.520 align:start position:0%
mean I'm not trying to be obstructionist
 
02:26:40.870 --> 02:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
I just want a clarification of what um
 
02:26:44.070 --> 02:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
the differing terms are um so so do I
 
02:26:47.550 --> 02:26:47.560 align:start position:0%
thank you yes sorry thank you um yes we
 
02:26:49.790 --> 02:26:49.800 align:start position:0%
represent refugees ases we have people
 
02:26:51.349 --> 02:26:51.359 align:start position:0%
that are here on on student visas we
 
02:26:55.030 --> 02:26:55.040 align:start position:0%
have people that are um people who marry
 
02:26:57.150 --> 02:26:57.160 align:start position:0%
US citizen spouses or you know people
 
02:26:58.510 --> 02:26:58.520 align:start position:0%
that have green cards and then they need
 
02:27:01.750 --> 02:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
to adjust and get those as well um we
 
02:27:05.269 --> 02:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
have people who are currently in o r
 
02:27:07.230 --> 02:27:07.240 align:start position:0%
custody if they're unaccompanied Refugee
 
02:27:09.950 --> 02:27:09.960 align:start position:0%
minors if a child crosses uh the border
 
02:27:11.309 --> 02:27:11.319 align:start position:0%
into the United States and they are not
 
02:27:13.670 --> 02:27:13.680 align:start position:0%
in the company of a guardian or parent
 
02:27:15.830 --> 02:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
they are placed in o r custody the
 
02:27:18.110 --> 02:27:18.120 align:start position:0%
office of refugee resettlement because
 
02:27:19.510 --> 02:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
they are a child they are under the age
 
02:27:23.110 --> 02:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
of 18 they are transferred to um what is
 
02:27:25.550 --> 02:27:25.560 align:start position:0%
called o custody and then they get
 
02:27:28.750 --> 02:27:28.760 align:start position:0%
placed in say long-term foster care
 
02:27:31.630 --> 02:27:31.640 align:start position:0%
placements so if that child requires
 
02:27:34.950 --> 02:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
legal services to get an EAD card um
 
02:27:37.510 --> 02:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
then we help them that way Mr chair one
 
02:27:41.429 --> 02:27:41.439 align:start position:0%
more followup followup um thank you
 
02:27:46.469 --> 02:27:46.479 align:start position:0%
again for that thorough answer and um uh
 
02:27:49.630 --> 02:27:49.640 align:start position:0%
as a side note um I I do like and
 
02:27:51.190 --> 02:27:51.200 align:start position:0%
appreciate I'm hearing from the work you
 
02:27:52.469 --> 02:27:52.479 align:start position:0%
do with the different groups of people
 
02:27:55.150 --> 02:27:55.160 align:start position:0%
you mentioned a group
 
02:27:57.870 --> 02:27:57.880 align:start position:0%
people people looking to get
 
02:28:00.750 --> 02:28:00.760 align:start position:0%
married are they non-resident
 
02:28:02.870 --> 02:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
aliens according to the definition I
 
02:28:03.830 --> 02:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
would suppose that it would be a
 
02:28:05.469 --> 02:28:05.479 align:start position:0%
non-resident alien if but they're not
 
02:28:08.230 --> 02:28:08.240 align:start position:0%
necessarily Asylum or Refugee Seekers
 
02:28:10.070 --> 02:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
correct but they are present legally
 
02:28:12.030 --> 02:28:12.040 align:start position:0%
they are getting married to or already
 
02:28:14.150 --> 02:28:14.160 align:start position:0%
married to a United States citizen and
 
02:28:16.950 --> 02:28:16.960 align:start position:0%
they might be pending their Green Card a
 
02:28:18.309 --> 02:28:18.319 align:start position:0%
conditional Green Card sometimes you can
 
02:28:20.190 --> 02:28:20.200 align:start position:0%
get uh that lasts for two years and the
 
02:28:21.349 --> 02:28:21.359 align:start position:0%
you have to petition to get those
 
02:28:23.790 --> 02:28:23.800 align:start position:0%
conditions removed uh but according to
 
02:28:26.030 --> 02:28:26.040 align:start position:0%
the bill as it's written yes that person
 
02:28:28.110 --> 02:28:28.120 align:start position:0%
would fall into that category and may
 
02:28:29.469 --> 02:28:29.479 align:start position:0%
not be able to get a driver's license in
 
02:28:30.990 --> 02:28:31.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire thank you thank you so
 
02:28:33.110 --> 02:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
much representative Au thank you Mr
 
02:28:34.349 --> 02:28:34.359 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you again for taking my
 
02:28:38.590 --> 02:28:38.600 align:start position:0%
question um I think what if I can
 
02:28:40.670 --> 02:28:40.680 align:start position:0%
restate what you're what maybe you're
 
02:28:42.389 --> 02:28:42.399 align:start position:0%
getting at is just somebody who came
 
02:28:44.790 --> 02:28:44.800 align:start position:0%
into the country without making any
 
02:28:47.030 --> 02:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
contact with immigration
 
02:28:51.950 --> 02:28:51.960 align:start position:0%
or any kind of service then no
 
02:28:54.630 --> 02:28:54.640 align:start position:0%
all the people that we represent have
 
02:28:56.510 --> 02:28:56.520 align:start position:0%
been in contact with either ice Customs
 
02:28:58.750 --> 02:28:58.760 align:start position:0%
and Border Patrol a federal agent or
 
02:29:01.429 --> 02:29:01.439 align:start position:0%
someone of that way it's it's and it's
 
02:29:03.750 --> 02:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
not even the case that a person who and
 
02:29:06.269 --> 02:29:06.279 align:start position:0%
what we call enter without inspection or
 
02:29:08.550 --> 02:29:08.560 align:start position:0%
E let's say someone entered without
 
02:29:10.150 --> 02:29:10.160 align:start position:0%
inspection and was never caught by
 
02:29:12.550 --> 02:29:12.560 align:start position:0%
border patrol or by Ice they are not
 
02:29:15.269 --> 02:29:15.279 align:start position:0%
entitled to an EAD card there has to be
 
02:29:17.510 --> 02:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
some sort of basis for them to get that
 
02:29:19.429 --> 02:29:19.439 align:start position:0%
work authorization document card and
 
02:29:20.950 --> 02:29:20.960 align:start position:0%
that's when you would see people working
 
02:29:23.590 --> 02:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
without authorization
 
02:29:26.309 --> 02:29:26.319 align:start position:0%
um anywhere across the United
 
02:29:28.830 --> 02:29:28.840 align:start position:0%
States any other questions from the
 
02:29:32.429 --> 02:29:32.439 align:start position:0%

02:29:37.550 --> 02:29:37.560 align:start position:0%
Ryan I'm not sure if this is in your
 
02:29:40.429 --> 02:29:40.439 align:start position:0%
purview but my son married a woman from
 
02:29:44.950 --> 02:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
Columbia um it took her it took us 10
 
02:29:47.230 --> 02:29:47.240 align:start position:0%
years for to get her
 
02:29:50.790 --> 02:29:50.800 align:start position:0%
citizenship um she did get a green card
 
02:29:52.710 --> 02:29:52.720 align:start position:0%
um would she not be allowed to get a
 
02:29:56.230 --> 02:29:56.240 align:start position:0%
driver's license now under this uh under
 
02:29:59.950 --> 02:29:59.960 align:start position:0%
this bill if she doesn't have her green
 
02:30:02.670 --> 02:30:02.680 align:start position:0%
card then um she wouldn't be able to get
 
02:30:05.550 --> 02:30:05.560 align:start position:0%
a driver's license under the bill okay
 
02:30:07.990 --> 02:30:08.000 align:start position:0%

prediction when you out down 10 minutes

02:30:35.990 --> 02:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
Transportation thank you and thank you
 
02:30:37.030 --> 02:30:37.040 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the
 
02:30:38.990 --> 02:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity um I will be very brief
 
02:30:40.830 --> 02:30:40.840 align:start position:0%
because I think you've already had uh
 
02:30:42.469 --> 02:30:42.479 align:start position:0%
extensive testimony or I know you've
 
02:30:44.030 --> 02:30:44.040 align:start position:0%
already had extensive testimony on this
 
02:30:46.070 --> 02:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
and I think it's been very thorough uh
 
02:30:48.830 --> 02:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
I'd just like to make two points uh and
 
02:30:50.950 --> 02:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
by the way uh we are a refugee
 
02:30:52.630 --> 02:30:52.640 align:start position:0%
resettlement organization an immigrant
 
02:30:55.070 --> 02:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
support organization uh very similar to
 
02:30:57.830 --> 02:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
what asentria does here in the state um
 
02:30:59.870 --> 02:30:59.880 align:start position:0%
and we've been in the state since
 
02:31:02.389 --> 02:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
1980 uh the two points I would like to
 
02:31:04.389 --> 02:31:04.399 align:start position:0%
make are these the first one is when
 
02:31:07.750 --> 02:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
someone has work authorization here uh
 
02:31:10.230 --> 02:31:10.240 align:start position:0%
they should be able to get to work they
 
02:31:12.349 --> 02:31:12.359 align:start position:0%
should be able to take advantage of the
 
02:31:14.389 --> 02:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
opportunity that New Hampshire provides
 
02:31:16.309 --> 02:31:16.319 align:start position:0%
to them uh and I'm concerned that the
 
02:31:18.150 --> 02:31:18.160 align:start position:0%
way the bill is drafted it's very
 
02:31:20.990 --> 02:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
unclear who's actually entitled it to a
 
02:31:22.990 --> 02:31:23.000 align:start position:0%
driver's license let me talk about
 
02:31:26.190 --> 02:31:26.200 align:start position:0%
non-resident aliens um if a non-resident
 
02:31:29.110 --> 02:31:29.120 align:start position:0%
alien is anyone who doesn't have a green
 
02:31:32.269 --> 02:31:32.279 align:start position:0%
card or citizenship then we've got a
 
02:31:34.429 --> 02:31:34.439 align:start position:0%
very problematic definition because we
 
02:31:37.590 --> 02:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
have people in the State uh refugees are
 
02:31:40.030 --> 02:31:40.040 align:start position:0%
a good example and as indicated two
 
02:31:41.790 --> 02:31:41.800 align:start position:0%
years of vetting outside of the country
 
02:31:44.429 --> 02:31:44.439 align:start position:0%
before they come here uh as well as AES
 
02:31:47.429 --> 02:31:47.439 align:start position:0%
and by the way there's a definitional
 
02:31:49.389 --> 02:31:49.399 align:start position:0%
issue here I think as well an ay
 
02:31:50.990 --> 02:31:51.000 align:start position:0%
generally speaking of someone who has
 
02:31:53.309 --> 02:31:53.319 align:start position:0%
been granted Asylum as opposed to an
 
02:31:53.319 --> 02:31:54.349 align:start position:0%
been granted Asylum as opposed to an
asylum

02:31:54.349 --> 02:31:54.359 align:start position:0%
asylum
 
02:31:56.750 --> 02:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
Seeker um but that doesn't mean when you
 
02:31:58.510 --> 02:31:58.520 align:start position:0%
are an asylum Seeker that you are
 
02:32:00.950 --> 02:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
unlawfully in the country or don't have
 
02:32:02.990 --> 02:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
authorization to be here but once you
 
02:32:05.150 --> 02:32:05.160 align:start position:0%
are an asy and once you've been granted
 
02:32:08.389 --> 02:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
Asylum by a Immigration Court you are on
 
02:32:11.469 --> 02:32:11.479 align:start position:0%
a path to citizenship now it can take up
 
02:32:13.990 --> 02:32:14.000 align:start position:0%
to a year or wait you have up to a year
 
02:32:15.910 --> 02:32:15.920 align:start position:0%
to apply for a green card and then the
 
02:32:18.030 --> 02:32:18.040 align:start position:0%
Green Card application can take up to
 
02:32:20.630 --> 02:32:20.640 align:start position:0%
two years so that means you are lawfully
 
02:32:22.429 --> 02:32:22.439 align:start position:0%
in the country you are fully authorized
 
02:32:24.269 --> 02:32:24.279 align:start position:0%
to be here fully authorized to work but
 
02:32:25.309 --> 02:32:25.319 align:start position:0%
you have to wait three years for a
 
02:32:27.990 --> 02:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
driver's license uh and that does not
 
02:32:30.389 --> 02:32:30.399 align:start position:0%
make any sense to me I also don't think
 
02:32:32.710 --> 02:32:32.720 align:start position:0%
that we would consider for example
 
02:32:35.030 --> 02:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
refugees and ases here as temporary
 
02:32:37.510 --> 02:32:37.520 align:start position:0%
residents because they have the right to
 
02:32:38.550 --> 02:32:38.560 align:start position:0%

02:32:46.550 --> 02:32:46.560 align:start position:0%
process uh and that's basically all I
 
02:32:47.790 --> 02:32:47.800 align:start position:0%
have I think you've heard everything
 
02:32:49.910 --> 02:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
else I will also recommend to you a
 
02:32:50.870 --> 02:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
letter from the New Hampshire

immigration rights network uh that is
 
02:32:56.070 --> 02:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
very detailed very extensive and I think
 
02:32:58.830 --> 02:32:58.840 align:start position:0%
quite accurate thank you thank you sir
 
02:33:01.070 --> 02:33:01.080 align:start position:0%
representative Au thank you Mr chairman
 
02:33:05.150 --> 02:33:05.160 align:start position:0%
thank you taking my question um how
 
02:33:10.070 --> 02:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
do how do asy Asylum Seekers and um
 
02:33:11.990 --> 02:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
refugees decide where to go in the
 
02:33:13.550 --> 02:33:13.560 align:start position:0%
country are they assigned a place or do
 
02:33:15.349 --> 02:33:15.359 align:start position:0%
they say I want to go to New Hampshire
 
02:33:18.150 --> 02:33:18.160 align:start position:0%
or do they have a choice the refugee
 
02:33:19.790 --> 02:33:19.800 align:start position:0%
program is a formal program through the
 
02:33:23.150 --> 02:33:23.160 align:start position:0%
State Department um when uh people have
 
02:33:25.070 --> 02:33:25.080 align:start position:0%
have been through the betting process uh
 
02:33:28.349 --> 02:33:28.359 align:start position:0%
with unhcr overseas uh and the state
 
02:33:31.190 --> 02:33:31.200 align:start position:0%
department accepts people they then uh
 
02:33:33.670 --> 02:33:33.680 align:start position:0%
basically determine across the country
 
02:33:35.429 --> 02:33:35.439 align:start position:0%
where refugees are going to go and there
 
02:33:38.750 --> 02:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
are 10 National agencies that deal with
 
02:33:41.950 --> 02:33:41.960 align:start position:0%
uh two or 300 local agencies so for
 
02:33:43.870 --> 02:33:43.880 align:start position:0%
example we deal with one of those a
 
02:33:46.429 --> 02:33:46.439 align:start position:0%
national agencies uscri we will tell
 
02:33:48.550 --> 02:33:48.560 align:start position:0%
them at the beginning of the year what
 
02:33:51.550 --> 02:33:51.560 align:start position:0%
we think the capacity is for our site in
 
02:33:54.030 --> 02:33:54.040 align:start position:0%
terms of what housing is available what
 
02:33:55.750 --> 02:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
our staff is you know what staff is
 
02:33:57.910 --> 02:33:57.920 align:start position:0%
available what we can do they'll assign
 
02:33:59.510 --> 02:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
us a number of refugees and then during
 
02:34:02.309 --> 02:34:02.319 align:start position:0%
the year as people become eligible
 
02:34:03.910 --> 02:34:03.920 align:start position:0%
having been through the process state
 
02:34:06.269 --> 02:34:06.279 align:start position:0%
department will and then uscri will say
 
02:34:08.429 --> 02:34:08.439 align:start position:0%
okay you know Manchester for example
 
02:34:10.550 --> 02:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
you're going to get these five families
 
02:34:14.230 --> 02:34:14.240 align:start position:0%
um they determine that based on family
 
02:34:18.830 --> 02:34:18.840 align:start position:0%
reunification uh similar um basically
 
02:34:20.790 --> 02:34:20.800 align:start position:0%
communities where where they won't be
 
02:34:22.990 --> 02:34:23.000 align:start position:0%
for example the only person coming from
 
02:34:25.469 --> 02:34:25.479 align:start position:0%
their country in that Community but also
 
02:34:27.630 --> 02:34:27.640 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we don't overwhelm any
 
02:34:30.910 --> 02:34:30.920 align:start position:0%
Community with uh Refugee with any
 
02:34:33.469 --> 02:34:33.479 align:start position:0%
particular group once a refugee is here
 
02:34:35.110 --> 02:34:35.120 align:start position:0%
in the country legally however they can
 
02:34:36.469 --> 02:34:36.479 align:start position:0%
determine where they want to go if they
 
02:34:37.910 --> 02:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
have a relative in California they can
 
02:34:40.630 --> 02:34:40.640 align:start position:0%
go to California or they can stay here
 
02:34:42.790 --> 02:34:42.800 align:start position:0%
uh and as many of them
 
02:34:47.830 --> 02:34:47.840 align:start position:0%
do followup thank you um so could this
 
02:34:50.830 --> 02:34:50.840 align:start position:0%
bill be perceived as trying to say to
 
02:34:52.910 --> 02:34:52.920 align:start position:0%
the state department don't settle any
 
02:34:54.950 --> 02:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
any refugees or siles here essentially
 
02:34:57.670 --> 02:34:57.680 align:start position:0%
trying to cut off their responsibility
 
02:34:59.790 --> 02:34:59.800 align:start position:0%
and put put the pressure on other states
 
02:35:01.790 --> 02:35:01.800 align:start position:0%
that would have to take the ases that
 
02:35:04.190 --> 02:35:04.200 align:start position:0%
aren't necessarily welcome here through
 
02:35:05.469 --> 02:35:05.479 align:start position:0%
through this well there there aren't
 
02:35:07.510 --> 02:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
states that have to take them other than
 
02:35:10.670 --> 02:35:10.680 align:start position:0%
every state I mean just like any person
 
02:35:12.389 --> 02:35:12.399 align:start position:0%
any citizen in the US you can move to
 
02:35:15.710 --> 02:35:15.720 align:start position:0%
any state you want um this bill in my
 
02:35:21.190 --> 02:35:21.200 align:start position:0%
opinion only uh would uh dis
 
02:35:23.990 --> 02:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
incent significant groups of lawfully
 
02:35:27.670 --> 02:35:27.680 align:start position:0%
admitted immigrants to be in the state
 
02:35:30.550 --> 02:35:30.560 align:start position:0%
and making it harder for them to
 
02:35:32.510 --> 02:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
work any other questions from the
 
02:35:35.190 --> 02:35:35.200 align:start position:0%
committee representative pataro thank
 
02:35:37.510 --> 02:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
02:35:37.520 --> 02:35:39.030 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
question

02:35:39.030 --> 02:35:39.040 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:35:43.030 --> 02:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
um uh The International Institute that
 
02:35:45.830 --> 02:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
you represent uh it's primarily focused
 
02:35:50.510 --> 02:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
on refugees and Asylum Seekers and to s
 
02:35:51.870 --> 02:35:51.880 align:start position:0%
in New
 
02:35:54.510 --> 02:35:54.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire well we're in new we also
 
02:35:56.389 --> 02:35:56.399 align:start position:0%
operate in Massachusetts but yes in New
 
02:35:59.710 --> 02:35:59.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and our primary function is
 
02:36:02.830 --> 02:36:02.840 align:start position:0%
refugees but we offer job training job
 
02:36:06.349 --> 02:36:06.359 align:start position:0%
placement esol courses uh and those are
 
02:36:08.830 --> 02:36:08.840 align:start position:0%
open to other authorized
 
02:36:11.110 --> 02:36:11.120 align:start position:0%
immigrants follow up please follow up
 
02:36:15.710 --> 02:36:15.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:20.070 --> 02:36:20.080 align:start position:0%
um is there a path for a refugee from A
 
02:36:23.990 --> 02:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
to B from Refugee your case to getting a
 
02:36:26.349 --> 02:36:26.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire driver's
 
02:36:30.269 --> 02:36:30.279 align:start position:0%
license uh since a refugee is legally
 
02:36:32.790 --> 02:36:32.800 align:start position:0%
admitted uh they are eligible for should
 
02:36:34.429 --> 02:36:34.439 align:start position:0%
be eligible for a New Hampshire driver's
 
02:36:36.150 --> 02:36:36.160 align:start position:0%
license when they arrive assuming that
 
02:36:38.349 --> 02:36:38.359 align:start position:0%
they go through the appropriate testing
 
02:36:40.630 --> 02:36:40.640 align:start position:0%
um this bill is very vague in that
 
02:36:44.349 --> 02:36:44.359 align:start position:0%
regard in terms of what they consider a
 
02:36:46.950 --> 02:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
non-resident alien one more followup
 
02:36:49.550 --> 02:36:49.560 align:start position:0%
followup um and I know it's not your
 
02:36:51.710 --> 02:36:51.720 align:start position:0%
expertise but any comments to the same
 
02:36:55.469 --> 02:36:55.479 align:start position:0%
question in regards to Asylum Seekers or
 
02:36:58.349 --> 02:36:58.359 align:start position:0%
ases uh certainly an asy has a full
 
02:37:00.150 --> 02:37:00.160 align:start position:0%
right to be here and is on a path to
 
02:37:02.469 --> 02:37:02.479 align:start position:0%
citizenship uh it seems to me this bill
 
02:37:03.670 --> 02:37:03.680 align:start position:0%
would prevent them from getting a
 
02:37:06.070 --> 02:37:06.080 align:start position:0%
driver's license until they get
 
02:37:08.030 --> 02:37:08.040 align:start position:0%
permanent resident status which as I
 
02:37:10.110 --> 02:37:10.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned could take up to three
 
02:37:12.630 --> 02:37:12.640 align:start position:0%
years thank you any other questions from
 
02:37:12.640 --> 02:37:13.349 align:start position:0%
years thank you any other questions from
the

02:37:13.349 --> 02:37:13.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:37:16.349 --> 02:37:16.359 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing any thank you sir
 
02:37:18.910 --> 02:37:18.920 align:start position:0%
thank you with that I have no other pink
 
02:37:20.750 --> 02:37:20.760 align:start position:0%
cards so I'm going to close the hearing
 
02:37:22.830 --> 02:37:22.840 align:start position:0%
on HP
 
02:37:25.870 --> 02:37:25.880 align:start position:0%
452 it's about 12:05 we are going to get
 
02:37:29.230 --> 02:37:29.240 align:start position:0%
together I believe at 2:00 for exec
 
02:37:33.150 --> 02:37:33.160 align:start position:0%
session at 2 o'cl so um I assume
 
02:37:35.550 --> 02:37:35.560 align:start position:0%
there'll be caucuses for the Republicans
 
02:37:37.349 --> 02:37:37.359 align:start position:0%
we'll be caucusing roughly at about
 
02:37:39.510 --> 02:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
let's get together about
 
02:37:43.190 --> 02:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
110 uh for Democrats we'll get
 
02:38:18.429 --> 02:38:18.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:18.439 --> 02:38:48.429 align:start position:0%

209 allowing a new vehicle purchased in

the model year or before to be inspected
 
04:49:11.430 --> 04:49:11.440 align:start position:0%
in the second year after purchas chair
 
04:49:13.390 --> 04:49:13.400 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative Gorski for a
 
04:49:15.990 --> 04:49:16.000 align:start position:0%
motion thank you Mr chair uh my motion
 
04:49:19.110 --> 04:49:19.120 align:start position:0%
for 209 is to
 
04:49:22.510 --> 04:49:22.520 align:start position:0%
retain motion is to retain 209 is there
 
04:49:25.190 --> 04:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
a second yes seconded by representative
 
04:49:27.030 --> 04:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
gas care to speak to your motion sir I
 
04:49:30.830 --> 04:49:30.840 align:start position:0%
do thank you um 209 I think um has some
 
04:49:33.670 --> 04:49:33.680 align:start position:0%
great merits however uh the main Prime
 
04:49:35.470 --> 04:49:35.480 align:start position:0%
sponsor still wants to kind of work on
 
04:49:38.350 --> 04:49:38.360 align:start position:0%
it and some things to kind of iron out
 
04:49:40.070 --> 04:49:40.080 align:start position:0%
and he thinks with more time he can make
 
04:49:41.390 --> 04:49:41.400 align:start position:0%
the Bild better
 
04:49:42.830 --> 04:49:42.840 align:start position:0%
based on that that's why I think we
 
04:49:42.840 --> 04:49:44.510 align:start position:0%
based on that that's why I think we
should

04:49:44.510 --> 04:49:44.520 align:start position:0%
should
 
04:49:46.830 --> 04:49:46.840 align:start position:0%
retain a recommendation of the Prime
 
04:49:49.230 --> 04:49:49.240 align:start position:0%
sponsor to retain anybody else from the
 
04:49:51.310 --> 04:49:51.320 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
04:49:54.470 --> 04:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
a thank you um I have supported this
 
04:49:55.670 --> 04:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
bill in the past I was actually a
 
04:49:57.070 --> 04:49:57.080 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor on it last time it came
 
04:50:00.628 --> 04:50:00.638 align:start position:0%
through uh but I I do agree that there
 
04:50:02.310 --> 04:50:02.320 align:start position:0%
probably should be some guardrails uh
 
04:50:04.510 --> 04:50:04.520 align:start position:0%
beyond what this bill contains and I'd
 
04:50:05.868 --> 04:50:05.878 align:start position:0%
like to give representative Coker some
 
04:50:07.270 --> 04:50:07.280 align:start position:0%
time to work on it and come up with
 
04:50:09.750 --> 04:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
those those guard rails fair enough
 
04:50:11.670 --> 04:50:11.680 align:start position:0%

pataro briefly actually seeing as how I
 
04:54:47.788 --> 04:54:47.798 align:start position:0%
just got through my public hearing on
 
04:54:49.230 --> 04:54:49.240 align:start position:0%
this this morning so it should be pretty
 
04:54:52.070 --> 04:54:52.080 align:start position:0%
fresh but just in summary uh I don't
 
04:54:53.910 --> 04:54:53.920 align:start position:0%
believe this is a controversial bill I
 
04:54:56.190 --> 04:54:56.200 align:start position:0%
believe it's actually a common sense and
 
04:54:58.230 --> 04:54:58.240 align:start position:0%
aair Bill I think it's
 
04:54:59.910 --> 04:54:59.920 align:start position:0%
straightforward just to refresh
 
04:55:01.230 --> 04:55:01.240 align:start position:0%
everybody's memory this makes some
 
04:55:03.150 --> 04:55:03.160 align:start position:0%
simple changes to the existing statutes
 
04:55:04.708 --> 04:55:04.718 align:start position:0%
regarding who can get a New Hampshire
 
04:55:07.548 --> 04:55:07.558 align:start position:0%
driver's license and the new paragraphs
 
04:55:11.548 --> 04:55:11.558 align:start position:0%
in there deal with the asylum
 
04:55:14.310 --> 04:55:14.320 align:start position:0%
Seekers only again I heard the rest of
 
04:55:16.670 --> 04:55:16.680 align:start position:0%
the hearing after I was done testifying
 
04:55:18.990 --> 04:55:19.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of the conversation was around
 
04:55:21.110 --> 04:55:21.120 align:start position:0%
refugees which this bill does not deal
 
04:55:22.470 --> 04:55:22.480 align:start position:0%
with that's a completely different
 
04:55:25.430 --> 04:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
situation uh those people apply in their
 
04:55:28.788 --> 04:55:28.798 align:start position:0%
country of origin um also not mentioned
 
04:55:31.590 --> 04:55:31.600 align:start position:0%
and not not dealt with in this bill is
 
04:55:35.430 --> 04:55:35.440 align:start position:0%
uh um humanitarian Parolees they are
 
04:55:38.708 --> 04:55:38.718 align:start position:0%
also not part of this bill passing this
 
04:55:40.910 --> 04:55:40.920 align:start position:0%
bill does not affect anybody here on an
 
04:55:44.548 --> 04:55:44.558 align:start position:0%
education where a student vacation
 
04:55:47.750 --> 04:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
tourist or work visa nothing of nothing
 
04:55:50.110 --> 04:55:50.120 align:start position:0%
in this these changes apply to
 
04:55:53.830 --> 04:55:53.840 align:start position:0%
them as I said in summary it's just I
 
04:55:57.230 --> 04:55:57.240 align:start position:0%
don't believe fair to the L biting
 
04:55:59.708 --> 04:55:59.718 align:start position:0%
citizens of the State of New Hampshire
 
04:56:01.670 --> 04:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
who do what they can to preserve their
 
04:56:04.310 --> 04:56:04.320 align:start position:0%
privilege to see this privilege given to
 
04:56:05.830 --> 04:56:05.840 align:start position:0%
others who have not proven that they are
 
04:56:08.430 --> 04:56:08.440 align:start position:0%
here legally yet it really is that
 
04:56:10.830 --> 04:56:10.840 align:start position:0%
simple if there were other if there was
 
04:56:13.310 --> 04:56:13.320 align:start position:0%
another way to do this without getting
 
04:56:15.190 --> 04:56:15.200 align:start position:0%
the people that actually are doing it
 
04:56:18.830 --> 04:56:18.840 align:start position:0%
the right way or our legitimate siles I
 
04:56:20.310 --> 04:56:20.320 align:start position:0%
would entertain it but I couldn't find
 
04:56:23.230 --> 04:56:23.240 align:start position:0%
another way to make the separation so
 
04:56:25.910 --> 04:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
again my testimony with you is fresh
 
04:56:28.788 --> 04:56:28.798 align:start position:0%
I'll leave it at that um I would hope
 
04:56:31.270 --> 04:56:31.280 align:start position:0%
the committee would support and ought to
 
04:56:36.070 --> 04:56:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:38.270 --> 04:56:38.280 align:start position:0%
committee represent saying
 
04:56:40.910 --> 04:56:40.920 align:start position:0%
clear thank you Mr chair my my only
 
04:56:42.910 --> 04:56:42.920 align:start position:0%
concern which I
 
04:56:46.628 --> 04:56:46.638 align:start position:0%
mentioned off the mic is uh how many
 
04:56:48.868 --> 04:56:48.878 align:start position:0%
people this would affect that have their
 
04:56:51.990 --> 04:56:52.000 align:start position:0%
licenses now that have gone by the rules
 
04:56:55.350 --> 04:56:55.360 align:start position:0%
such as they were and are uh and all of
 
04:56:56.948 --> 04:56:56.958 align:start position:0%
a sudden be told that they can't renew
 
04:56:59.390 --> 04:56:59.400 align:start position:0%
their license when they in fact have
 
04:57:01.270 --> 04:57:01.280 align:start position:0%
been playing by the rules that were set
 
04:57:03.750 --> 04:57:03.760 align:start position:0%
up and how that will negatively affect
 
04:57:08.030 --> 04:57:08.040 align:start position:0%
them with regards to uh potentially
 
04:57:10.708 --> 04:57:10.718 align:start position:0%
employment uh Etc that that's that's a
 
04:57:12.548 --> 04:57:12.558 align:start position:0%
concern for me and I if we weren't
 
04:57:15.310 --> 04:57:15.320 align:start position:0%
executing that this today I was hoping
 
04:57:17.670 --> 04:57:17.680 align:start position:0%
to get numbers from somebody to say how
 
04:57:20.430 --> 04:57:20.440 align:start position:0%
many potential people that would
 
04:57:22.430 --> 04:57:22.440 align:start position:0%
affect thank
 
04:57:25.830 --> 04:57:25.840 align:start position:0%
you fair enough uh but again we get down
 
04:57:28.590 --> 04:57:28.600 align:start position:0%
to what is playing by the rules have
 
04:57:30.030 --> 04:57:30.040 align:start position:0%
those people even if they've been here a
 
04:57:33.350 --> 04:57:33.360 align:start position:0%
long time pursued their Asylum hearings
 
04:57:35.868 --> 04:57:35.878 align:start position:0%
in Immigration courts we we don't
 
04:57:35.878 --> 04:57:37.948 align:start position:0%
in Immigration courts we we don't
know

04:57:37.948 --> 04:57:37.958 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:57:41.110 --> 04:57:41.120 align:start position:0%
yep granted but we but we also heard how
 
04:57:43.830 --> 04:57:43.840 align:start position:0%
long it takes to get through the process
 
04:57:46.430 --> 04:57:46.440 align:start position:0%
so I heard numbers up to 10 years which
 
04:57:49.110 --> 04:57:49.120 align:start position:0%
is crazy and I don't see that improving
 
04:57:51.708 --> 04:57:51.718 align:start position:0%
so again it these people are put in a
 
04:57:54.270 --> 04:57:54.280 align:start position:0%
hell of a spot uh waiting for the system
 
04:57:57.628 --> 04:57:57.638 align:start position:0%
to churn them through so to speak so
 
04:58:00.230 --> 04:58:00.240 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah and I won't go back and
 
04:58:01.788 --> 04:58:01.798 align:start position:0%
forth with everyone but just remind
 
04:58:03.510 --> 04:58:03.520 align:start position:0%
everybody I said in the hearing it's
 
04:58:05.830 --> 04:58:05.840 align:start position:0%
unfortunate we're in this situation the
 
04:58:08.390 --> 04:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
only reason it's taking 8 to 10 years is
 
04:58:11.670 --> 04:58:11.680 align:start position:0%
because of the overwhelming at the order
 
04:58:14.230 --> 04:58:14.240 align:start position:0%
and I it's hard to believe that anybody
 
04:58:15.948 --> 04:58:15.958 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have known that the system we
 
04:58:17.670 --> 04:58:17.680 align:start position:0%
had in place wasn't going to get
 
04:58:19.430 --> 04:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
overwhelmed anybody else from the
 
04:58:22.310 --> 04:58:22.320 align:start position:0%
committee representative B thank you Mr
 
04:58:24.470 --> 04:58:24.480 align:start position:0%
chairman um according to the
 
04:58:26.788 --> 04:58:26.798 align:start position:0%
Constitution immigration is the purview
 
04:58:30.390 --> 04:58:30.400 align:start position:0%
of the federal government and um this
 
04:58:32.670 --> 04:58:32.680 align:start position:0%
would attempt to overrule the federal
 
04:58:35.670 --> 04:58:35.680 align:start position:0%
government and it would violate at least
 
04:58:37.430 --> 04:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
seven different International agreements
 
04:58:40.948 --> 04:58:40.958 align:start position:0%
and treaties um I don't think
 
04:58:44.430 --> 04:58:44.440 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's a lawsuit magnet I I
 
04:58:46.390 --> 04:58:46.400 align:start position:0%
don't think this is something we're you
 
04:58:48.548 --> 04:58:48.558 align:start position:0%
know looking forward to trying to
 
04:58:51.750 --> 04:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
inforce um so for that reason I have to
 
04:58:51.760 --> 04:58:53.868 align:start position:0%
inforce um so for that reason I have to
oppose

04:58:53.868 --> 04:58:53.878 align:start position:0%
oppose
 
04:58:56.788 --> 04:58:56.798 align:start position:0%
this fair enough anybody else from the
 
04:58:59.430 --> 04:58:59.440 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
04:59:03.150 --> 04:59:03.160 align:start position:0%
Miller thank you Mr chairman um you you
 
04:59:05.350 --> 04:59:05.360 align:start position:0%
just said it's a common sense fair and
 
04:59:07.590 --> 04:59:07.600 align:start position:0%
simple bill and I think
 
04:59:10.310 --> 04:59:10.320 align:start position:0%
it I could understand seeing it that way
 
04:59:12.590 --> 04:59:12.600 align:start position:0%
but I strongly disagree among other
 
04:59:15.030 --> 04:59:15.040 align:start position:0%
things um to representative St Clair's
 
04:59:17.510 --> 04:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
point about trying to renew a license um
 
04:59:20.230 --> 04:59:20.240 align:start position:0%
and people who play by the rules uh line
 
04:59:23.030 --> 04:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
three the new paragraph added uh Roman
 
04:59:24.430 --> 04:59:24.440 align:start position:0%
numeral three the department shall not
 
04:59:25.670 --> 04:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
renew a driver's license for any person
 
04:59:28.270 --> 04:59:28.280 align:start position:0%
who is not a United States citizen and
 
04:59:29.990 --> 04:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
cannot prove that they are lawful per
 
04:59:31.948 --> 04:59:31.958 align:start position:0%
permanent resident of the United States
 
04:59:34.110 --> 04:59:34.120 align:start position:0%
the fact that there's an and there is a
 
04:59:37.150 --> 04:59:37.160 align:start position:0%
problem um moreover someone who has
 
04:59:40.030 --> 04:59:40.040 align:start position:0%
arrived in this country uh as a
 
04:59:42.230 --> 04:59:42.240 align:start position:0%
temporary worker on a work visa from a
 
04:59:43.868 --> 04:59:43.878 align:start position:0%
foreign country has had their license
 
04:59:46.150 --> 04:59:46.160 align:start position:0%
issued and is still here some years
 
04:59:48.270 --> 04:59:48.280 align:start position:0%
later still on a work visa and needs to
 
04:59:50.110 --> 04:59:50.120 align:start position:0%
renew their license would be precluded
 
04:59:52.430 --> 04:59:52.440 align:start position:0%
based on this because it explicitly says
 
04:59:53.750 --> 04:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
the license shall not renew for any
 
04:59:55.070 --> 04:59:55.080 align:start position:0%
person who's not a United States citizen
 
04:59:56.190 --> 04:59:56.200 align:start position:0%
and cannot prove that they are lawful
 
04:59:57.948 --> 04:59:57.958 align:start position:0%
permanent resident I understand that you
 
04:59:59.310 --> 04:59:59.320 align:start position:0%
might not want that to be the case but
 
05:00:00.510 --> 05:00:00.520 align:start position:0%
as I read it I believe that's how it
 
05:00:03.750 --> 05:00:03.760 align:start position:0%
would be enforced um moreover there's a
 
05:00:05.948 --> 05:00:05.958 align:start position:0%
section here that describes uh election
 
05:00:08.030 --> 05:00:08.040 align:start position:0%
related rules and that came up uh during
 
05:00:10.230 --> 05:00:10.240 align:start position:0%
the conversation the Q&amp;A uh earlier in
 
05:00:12.030 --> 05:00:12.040 align:start position:0%
the testimony I also serve as a
 
05:00:14.190 --> 05:00:14.200 align:start position:0%
moderator uh for elections and have
 
05:00:15.390 --> 05:00:15.400 align:start position:0%
significant experience with the
 
05:00:17.390 --> 05:00:17.400 align:start position:0%
registration process and checking voter
 
05:00:21.150 --> 05:00:21.160 align:start position:0%
IDs uh someone who wants to register as
 
05:00:24.310 --> 05:00:24.320 align:start position:0%
a voter must present proof of
 
05:00:27.470 --> 05:00:27.480 align:start position:0%
citizenship uh to be able to do so this
 
05:00:31.990 --> 05:00:32.000 align:start position:0%
does not do that um and as effective as
 
05:00:33.670 --> 05:00:33.680 align:start position:0%
of last November just after the general
 
05:00:35.990 --> 05:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
election with the new rules took Effect
 
05:00:39.430 --> 05:00:39.440 align:start position:0%
one can no longer affidavit citizenship
 
05:00:41.708 --> 05:00:41.718 align:start position:0%
and so the section of this bill that
 
05:00:43.350 --> 05:00:43.360 align:start position:0%
talks about using these licenses and
 
05:00:45.230 --> 05:00:45.240 align:start position:0%
needing to have a special marker some
 
05:00:47.628 --> 05:00:47.638 align:start position:0%
sort of uh distinction because related
 
05:00:50.868 --> 05:00:50.878 align:start position:0%
to election law is entirely Superfluous
 
05:00:52.788 --> 05:00:52.798 align:start position:0%
it does not have any impact there
 
05:00:54.350 --> 05:00:54.360 align:start position:0%
because that person would not have been
 
05:00:56.830 --> 05:00:56.840 align:start position:0%
able to register to vote lacking
 
05:00:58.110 --> 05:00:58.120 align:start position:0%
citizenship and the inability to
 
05:01:02.150 --> 05:01:02.160 align:start position:0%
affidavit that um that situation um
 
05:01:04.430 --> 05:01:04.440 align:start position:0%
finally I would note um and we have
 
05:01:06.470 --> 05:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
talked a little bit about this in the
 
05:01:09.350 --> 05:01:09.360 align:start position:0%
Q&amp;A earlier about the folks being able
 
05:01:12.390 --> 05:01:12.400 align:start position:0%
to get to work this bill ultimately
 
05:01:16.510 --> 05:01:16.520 align:start position:0%
removes people who are un under federal
 
05:01:19.270 --> 05:01:19.280 align:start position:0%
law able to work legally in the United
 
05:01:20.590 --> 05:01:20.600 align:start position:0%
States it removes them from the
 
05:01:23.470 --> 05:01:23.480 align:start position:0%
workforce in New Hampshire um oftentimes
 
05:01:25.990 --> 05:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
these are people doing things like
 
05:01:30.070 --> 05:01:30.080 align:start position:0%
health aids or other generally speaking
 
05:01:32.150 --> 05:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
underpaid for the level of service they
 
05:01:34.788 --> 05:01:34.798 align:start position:0%
provide work um these are people that we
 
05:01:36.190 --> 05:01:36.200 align:start position:0%
will have a very difficult time
 
05:01:38.590 --> 05:01:38.600 align:start position:0%
replacing in our Workforce and you are
 
05:01:40.150 --> 05:01:40.160 align:start position:0%
now telling them that they will no
 
05:01:41.910 --> 05:01:41.920 align:start position:0%
longer have access to means to get to
 
05:01:45.030 --> 05:01:45.040 align:start position:0%
their job uh to help all of us who need
 
05:01:47.628 --> 05:01:47.638 align:start position:0%
it and um
 
05:01:50.150 --> 05:01:50.160 align:start position:0%
I I'm going to stop there I could say a
 
05:01:51.670 --> 05:01:51.680 align:start position:0%
lot more but I'm going to stop there and
 
05:01:54.590 --> 05:01:54.600 align:start position:0%
say for all of those reasons I uh
 
05:01:57.830 --> 05:01:57.840 align:start position:0%
encourage that this bill not move
 
05:02:00.750 --> 05:02:00.760 align:start position:0%
forward anybody else from the
 
05:02:08.150 --> 05:02:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:12.390 --> 05:02:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:14.310 --> 05:02:14.320 align:start position:0%
so new
 
05:02:17.110 --> 05:02:17.120 align:start position:0%
paragraph says that you can't renew a
 
05:02:19.830 --> 05:02:19.840 align:start position:0%
license for any person who is blah blah
 
05:02:24.430 --> 05:02:24.440 align:start position:0%
so renew that happens at 5 years I
 
05:02:26.190 --> 05:02:26.200 align:start position:0%
believe then
 
05:02:30.310 --> 05:02:30.320 align:start position:0%
26340 a for issuance of licenses covers
 
05:02:33.590 --> 05:02:33.600 align:start position:0%
non-resident aliens are there a lot of
 
05:02:36.750 --> 05:02:36.760 align:start position:0%
cases where non-resident aliens are
 
05:02:38.910 --> 05:02:38.920 align:start position:0%
working in New Hampshire for six seven
 
05:02:40.430 --> 05:02:40.440 align:start position:0%
or eight years cuz they would be the
 
05:02:42.948 --> 05:02:42.958 align:start position:0%
only people
 
05:02:47.110 --> 05:02:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:51.548 --> 05:02:51.558 align:start position:0%
of I'm not sure good yeah I'm unaware of
 
05:02:53.350 --> 05:02:53.360 align:start position:0%
a Visa program that lets somebody work
 
05:02:56.270 --> 05:02:56.280 align:start position:0%
here for 10 years so I'm not sure who
 
05:02:59.910 --> 05:02:59.920 align:start position:0%
would be affected by that at all
 
05:03:02.190 --> 05:03:02.200 align:start position:0%
um thank you for that anybody else from
 
05:03:02.200 --> 05:03:05.590 align:start position:0%
um thank you for that anybody else from
the

05:03:05.590 --> 05:03:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:10.350 --> 05:03:10.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:11.548 --> 05:03:11.558 align:start position:0%
it's actually helpful to have the
 
05:03:13.270 --> 05:03:13.280 align:start position:0%
hearing in the exact section on the same
 
05:03:15.750 --> 05:03:15.760 align:start position:0%
day uh without seeing anybody any other
 
05:03:17.030 --> 05:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
discussion I'll ask the clerk to call

Bill 649 motions ought to pass is there
 
05:05:30.628 --> 05:05:30.638 align:start position:0%

05:05:32.470 --> 05:05:32.480 align:start position:0%
representative Hill care to speak your
 
05:05:35.670 --> 05:05:35.680 align:start position:0%
motion sir yes sir thank you Mr chair
 
05:05:38.628 --> 05:05:38.638 align:start position:0%
so we have gotten all kinds of
 
05:05:40.628 --> 05:05:40.638 align:start position:0%
testimonies dozens dozens even hundreds
 
05:05:42.230 --> 05:05:42.240 align:start position:0%
of emails to my account specifically
 
05:05:44.670 --> 05:05:44.680 align:start position:0%
talking about how uh civilians have had
 
05:05:47.070 --> 05:05:47.080 align:start position:0%
the had advantage taken of them this is
 
05:05:49.430 --> 05:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
not a requirement in most other states
 
05:05:52.190 --> 05:05:52.200 align:start position:0%
um there's 11 states that do safety
 
05:05:54.150 --> 05:05:54.160 align:start position:0%
inspections as we know it 17 states that
 
05:05:58.310 --> 05:05:58.320 align:start position:0%
do um some form of emissions testing uh
 
05:05:59.868 --> 05:05:59.878 align:start position:0%
what we do is not emissions testing it's
 
05:06:02.070 --> 05:06:02.080 align:start position:0%
an engine code read and uh I even asked
 
05:06:04.310 --> 05:06:04.320 align:start position:0%
the gentleman during committee um you
 
05:06:05.670 --> 05:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
know if there was anything that could
 
05:06:07.788 --> 05:06:07.798 align:start position:0%
throw your engine light on that would
 
05:06:10.070 --> 05:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
not change emissions and he said no but
 
05:06:11.788 --> 05:06:11.798 align:start position:0%
I know as a fact and as a mechanical
 
05:06:13.788 --> 05:06:13.798 align:start position:0%
student that a loose gas cap will throw
 
05:06:15.670 --> 05:06:15.680 align:start position:0%
an engine light and will not change your
 
05:06:18.230 --> 05:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
emissions that a bad uh cam position
 
05:06:20.470 --> 05:06:20.480 align:start position:0%
sensor or a bad electrical wire will do
 
05:06:23.270 --> 05:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
that the um the onboard diagnostics
 
05:06:26.070 --> 05:06:26.080 align:start position:0%
reads Electronics further we've had a
 
05:06:28.750 --> 05:06:28.760 align:start position:0%
lot of uh testimony that people that
 
05:06:30.788 --> 05:06:30.798 align:start position:0%
don't know cars very well or have been
 
05:06:33.708 --> 05:06:33.718 align:start position:0%
taken advantage of uh again this is this
 
05:06:35.628 --> 05:06:35.638 align:start position:0%
is the only good or service that I can
 
05:06:37.830 --> 05:06:37.840 align:start position:0%
think of where if you don't buy it on
 
05:06:40.030 --> 05:06:40.040 align:start position:0%
the private Market the state identifies
 
05:06:41.750 --> 05:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
itself as a victim and levies a fine
 
05:06:43.110 --> 05:06:43.120 align:start position:0%
there's no other place in New Hampshire
 
05:06:44.548 --> 05:06:44.558 align:start position:0%
code of law that I've been able to find
 
05:06:46.948 --> 05:06:46.958 align:start position:0%
that so we've created a mandatory Market
 
05:06:48.670 --> 05:06:48.680 align:start position:0%
to the vendors which is not the purpose
 
05:06:50.590 --> 05:06:50.600 align:start position:0%
of this government and it doesn't
 
05:06:52.628 --> 05:06:52.638 align:start position:0%
actually absolve the driver of liability
 
05:06:54.670 --> 05:06:54.680 align:start position:0%
for their equipment it gives a false
 
05:06:57.470 --> 05:06:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:59.670 --> 05:06:59.680 align:start position:0%
security thank you sir anybody else from
 
05:06:59.680 --> 05:07:00.510 align:start position:0%
security thank you sir anybody else from
the

05:07:00.510 --> 05:07:00.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:07:03.628 --> 05:07:03.638 align:start position:0%
committee representative thank you Mr
 
05:07:06.948 --> 05:07:06.958 align:start position:0%
chairman um I agree that that there are
 
05:07:09.548 --> 05:07:09.558 align:start position:0%
a lot of problems with the the uh
 
05:07:12.350 --> 05:07:12.360 align:start position:0%
inspection program as it is um but I
 
05:07:14.510 --> 05:07:14.520 align:start position:0%
don't know if I'm quite ready to go so
 
05:07:17.150 --> 05:07:17.160 align:start position:0%
far as to eliminate the whole thing you
 
05:07:21.030 --> 05:07:21.040 align:start position:0%
know sarily um I you know for example I
 
05:07:22.430 --> 05:07:22.440 align:start position:0%
would like to see if it makes sense to
 
05:07:24.230 --> 05:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
separate the emissions testing from the
 
05:07:27.030 --> 05:07:27.040 align:start position:0%
safety inspection part of it um
 
05:07:30.830 --> 05:07:30.840 align:start position:0%
so while I'm not ready to vote OTP for
 
05:07:33.270 --> 05:07:33.280 align:start position:0%
this I would support retaining it and
 
05:07:35.350 --> 05:07:35.360 align:start position:0%
bringing it back after we've answered
 
05:07:37.990 --> 05:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
more questions and
 
05:07:42.948 --> 05:07:42.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:48.310 --> 05:07:48.320 align:start position:0%
s thank you Mr chairman so um yeah I I
 
05:07:51.070 --> 05:07:51.080 align:start position:0%
was uh in support of retaining House
 
05:07:53.708 --> 05:07:53.718 align:start position:0%
Bill 209 because there are questions
 
05:07:55.708 --> 05:07:55.718 align:start position:0%
that have been legitimately raised and
 
05:07:59.190 --> 05:07:59.200 align:start position:0%
it is certainly within the perview of of
 
05:08:01.310 --> 05:08:01.320 align:start position:0%
us as a policy committee to take a look
 
05:08:05.190 --> 05:08:05.200 align:start position:0%
at those things and try and uh do the
 
05:08:07.030 --> 05:08:07.040 align:start position:0%
right thing for the citizens of the
 
05:08:10.150 --> 05:08:10.160 align:start position:0%
state and and that includes safety
 
05:08:14.390 --> 05:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
issues as well as you know um the that
 
05:08:16.390 --> 05:08:16.400 align:start position:0%
the inspection
 
05:08:19.670 --> 05:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
program uh is an important component of
 
05:08:22.868 --> 05:08:22.878 align:start position:0%
in my opinion um I also think it's very
 
05:08:24.990 --> 05:08:25.000 align:start position:0%
important to realize that for those of
 
05:08:26.868 --> 05:08:26.878 align:start position:0%
us who are not mechanically
 
05:08:31.548 --> 05:08:31.558 align:start position:0%
inclined I being one of them um it's
 
05:08:36.190 --> 05:08:36.200 align:start position:0%
it's I I find that there's I usually
 
05:08:38.110 --> 05:08:38.120 align:start position:0%
have a chance to interface with my
 
05:08:40.788 --> 05:08:40.798 align:start position:0%
mechanic if I notice something which is
 
05:08:43.510 --> 05:08:43.520 align:start position:0%
rare because I not mechanically inclined
 
05:08:48.230 --> 05:08:48.240 align:start position:0%
or at inspection time and he I believe
 
05:08:51.150 --> 05:08:51.160 align:start position:0%
correctly points out um when something
 
05:08:54.510 --> 05:08:54.520 align:start position:0%
needs to be done uh I
 
05:08:59.350 --> 05:08:59.360 align:start position:0%
think I have asked for and not as of yet
 
05:09:01.948 --> 05:09:01.958 align:start position:0%
have not received the data to know about
 
05:09:03.990 --> 05:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
how many complaints are actually being
 
05:09:07.390 --> 05:09:07.400 align:start position:0%
made we have we have tweaked the law
 
05:09:11.430 --> 05:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
recently in uh in in this uh committee
 
05:09:13.390 --> 05:09:13.400 align:start position:0%
to try and make it possible for people
 
05:09:16.030 --> 05:09:16.040 align:start position:0%
to who have feel AG grieved by the
 
05:09:19.708 --> 05:09:19.718 align:start position:0%
process to be uh
 
05:09:22.990 --> 05:09:23.000 align:start position:0%
notify uh the the state that they are
 
05:09:24.788 --> 05:09:24.798 align:start position:0%
they are grieved and that there's a
 
05:09:27.270 --> 05:09:27.280 align:start position:0%
chance for the Troopers to take a look
 
05:09:29.270 --> 05:09:29.280 align:start position:0%
at the inspection program and so on and
 
05:09:31.350 --> 05:09:31.360 align:start position:0%
I think we've we've taken some good
 
05:09:35.150 --> 05:09:35.160 align:start position:0%
steps in the right direction
 
05:09:38.868 --> 05:09:38.878 align:start position:0%
I I think the proper course of action
 
05:09:42.708 --> 05:09:42.718 align:start position:0%
for for this committee would be to at
 
05:09:45.430 --> 05:09:45.440 align:start position:0%
the at the very least retain and
 
05:09:49.868 --> 05:09:49.878 align:start position:0%
preferably itl it and make one bill the
 
05:09:52.390 --> 05:09:52.400 align:start position:0%
right bill as opposed to having two
 
05:09:56.230 --> 05:09:56.240 align:start position:0%
bills essentially talking about the same
 
05:09:58.948 --> 05:09:58.958 align:start position:0%
topic that may potentially run into
 
05:10:01.910 --> 05:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
conflict with each other um down the
 
05:10:04.270 --> 05:10:04.280 align:start position:0%
road a piece in terms of the legislative
 
05:10:07.788 --> 05:10:07.798 align:start position:0%
process so uh for that reason and others
 
05:10:11.150 --> 05:10:11.160 align:start position:0%
I would vote against the OTP and and
 
05:10:14.390 --> 05:10:14.400 align:start position:0%
would would support a retain retained
 
05:10:16.590 --> 05:10:16.600 align:start position:0%
Bill status where we could as a
 
05:10:20.070 --> 05:10:20.080 align:start position:0%
committee put the two concepts together
 
05:10:23.628 --> 05:10:23.638 align:start position:0%
and work and make it one good bill
 
05:10:25.750 --> 05:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
instead of
 
05:10:31.110 --> 05:10:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:33.350 --> 05:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
forward anybody else in the committee
 
05:10:34.990 --> 05:10:35.000 align:start position:0%
let me go around the room first
 
05:10:38.030 --> 05:10:38.040 align:start position:0%
representative Gorski thank you Mr
 
05:10:40.548 --> 05:10:40.558 align:start position:0%
chairman you for me I've always been a
 
05:10:43.628 --> 05:10:43.638 align:start position:0%
supporter of the inspection program
 
05:10:43.638 --> 05:10:45.190 align:start position:0%
supporter of the inspection program
however

05:10:45.190 --> 05:10:45.200 align:start position:0%
however
 
05:10:47.470 --> 05:10:47.480 align:start position:0%
recently the amount of mail I've gotten
 
05:10:49.548 --> 05:10:49.558 align:start position:0%
from my constituents regarding this
 
05:10:51.390 --> 05:10:51.400 align:start position:0%
program has been
 
05:10:55.430 --> 05:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
overwhelming to say we got to get rid of
 
05:10:59.190 --> 05:10:59.200 align:start position:0%
it and I mean when I say overwhelming I
 
05:11:02.110 --> 05:11:02.120 align:start position:0%
good 90 to 95% of my constituents have
 
05:11:05.708 --> 05:11:05.718 align:start position:0%
said that they want this particular
 
05:11:08.470 --> 05:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
program gone and I'm here to represent
 
05:11:10.110 --> 05:11:10.120 align:start position:0%
my constituent even though I kind of
 
05:11:12.510 --> 05:11:12.520 align:start position:0%
feel somewhat strongly about the program
 
05:11:14.708 --> 05:11:14.718 align:start position:0%
so that's why I'm going to be voting
 
05:11:18.070 --> 05:11:18.080 align:start position:0%
OTP um for this particular
 
05:11:22.628 --> 05:11:22.638 align:start position:0%
Bill anybody else representative Miller
 
05:11:24.350 --> 05:11:24.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
05:11:29.350 --> 05:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
um I also am inclined to think that our
 
05:11:32.150 --> 05:11:32.160 align:start position:0%
uh safety inspection program certainly
 
05:11:35.110 --> 05:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
has its flaws and has potential to be uh
 
05:11:38.470 --> 05:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
replaced or removed um at the same time
 
05:11:40.430 --> 05:11:40.440 align:start position:0%
I think I have some of the same concerns
 
05:11:43.230 --> 05:11:43.240 align:start position:0%
as representative Sykes and Vu who uh
 
05:11:44.510 --> 05:11:44.520 align:start position:0%
and some of the things we heard during
 
05:11:47.350 --> 05:11:47.360 align:start position:0%
the testimony specifically
 
05:11:50.190 --> 05:11:50.200 align:start position:0%
around killing this and potentially
 
05:11:52.548 --> 05:11:52.558 align:start position:0%
finding ourselves uh in non-compliance
 
05:11:55.590 --> 05:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
with the EPA um and the funding
 
05:11:57.390 --> 05:11:57.400 align:start position:0%
associated with that which I understand
 
05:11:59.310 --> 05:11:59.320 align:start position:0%
there's no guarantee that it disappears
 
05:12:00.670 --> 05:12:00.680 align:start position:0%
there's no guarantee that we have an EPA
 
05:12:03.788 --> 05:12:03.798 align:start position:0%
by the time this takes effect but that
 
05:12:05.708 --> 05:12:05.718 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding uh we are talking about
 
05:12:07.350 --> 05:12:07.360 align:start position:0%
potentially hundreds of millions of
 
05:12:12.830 --> 05:12:12.840 align:start position:0%
dollars in do fund on that I think is
 
05:12:14.948 --> 05:12:14.958 align:start position:0%
irresponsible to put at risk when we
 
05:12:17.750 --> 05:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to relatively
 
05:12:20.990 --> 05:12:21.000 align:start position:0%
easily put a clause in that allows that
 
05:12:25.310 --> 05:12:25.320 align:start position:0%
to that allows the change to be timed or
 
05:12:26.708 --> 05:12:26.718 align:start position:0%
structured such that it is in
 
05:12:30.590 --> 05:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
conjunction with the epa's approval and
 
05:12:33.910 --> 05:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
so I I also received a lot of the
 
05:12:36.430 --> 05:12:36.440 align:start position:0%
feedback that all of us did I think via
 
05:12:39.788 --> 05:12:39.798 align:start position:0%
email um I think that the of the people
 
05:12:42.070 --> 05:12:42.080 align:start position:0%
that I engaged with in a dialogue about
 
05:12:46.230 --> 05:12:46.240 align:start position:0%
it uh understand that there is that risk
 
05:12:50.390 --> 05:12:50.400 align:start position:0%
in play um and even the uh gentleman who
 
05:12:53.470 --> 05:12:53.480 align:start position:0%
testified with us uh as along with the
 
05:12:56.270 --> 05:12:56.280 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor uh sent an email noting
 
05:12:59.310 --> 05:12:59.320 align:start position:0%
that he understood the risks associated
 
05:13:01.548 --> 05:13:01.558 align:start position:0%
with that and the potential to separate
 
05:13:04.110 --> 05:13:04.120 align:start position:0%
out the emissions from the in safety
 
05:13:06.510 --> 05:13:06.520 align:start position:0%
inspection portion of this and the uh
 
05:13:08.150 --> 05:13:08.160 align:start position:0%
value that could provide and offered to
 
05:13:09.910 --> 05:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
join a subcommittee
 
05:13:12.030 --> 05:13:12.040 align:start position:0%
um and work with us to help refine the
 
05:13:14.430 --> 05:13:14.440 align:start position:0%
bill to get it to something that is in
 
05:13:17.270 --> 05:13:17.280 align:start position:0%
fact uh good for our constituents and
 
05:13:19.750 --> 05:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
still allows us to meet our obligations
 
05:13:21.110 --> 05:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
uh Vis emissions to the federal
 
05:13:23.430 --> 05:13:23.440 align:start position:0%
government and so in that sense uh a
 
05:13:25.628 --> 05:13:25.638 align:start position:0%
subcommittee or retain uh would be my
 
05:13:27.390 --> 05:13:27.400 align:start position:0%
suggestion as
 
05:13:30.670 --> 05:13:30.680 align:start position:0%
well anybody else represent
 
05:13:32.868 --> 05:13:32.878 align:start position:0%
pandon thank you Mr
 
05:13:35.548 --> 05:13:35.558 align:start position:0%
chair I too have concerns with this and
 
05:13:39.110 --> 05:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
and I agree in in the people I've spoken
 
05:13:40.070 --> 05:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
to and
 
05:13:43.070 --> 05:13:43.080 align:start position:0%
mechanics to quote some of them um I
 
05:13:45.788 --> 05:13:45.798 align:start position:0%
think we have created a monster and I do
 
05:13:47.830 --> 05:13:47.840 align:start position:0%
think we do need to look at our
 
05:13:50.430 --> 05:13:50.440 align:start position:0%
inspection process um but I want more
 
05:13:53.350 --> 05:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
information uh like possibly separating
 
05:13:56.150 --> 05:13:56.160 align:start position:0%
emissions not losing jeopardizing
 
05:13:58.670 --> 05:13:58.680 align:start position:0%
Federal monies uh I've have questions on
 
05:14:00.510 --> 05:14:00.520 align:start position:0%
the citizen inspectors because I've
 
05:14:03.628 --> 05:14:03.638 align:start position:0%
heard complaints from garages uh
 
05:14:05.830 --> 05:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
regarding them
 
05:14:08.430 --> 05:14:08.440 align:start position:0%
um I think we need to simplify our
 
05:14:09.868 --> 05:14:09.878 align:start position:0%
inspection proc process it's very
 
05:14:13.110 --> 05:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
convoluted now and uh you know maybe
 
05:14:15.230 --> 05:14:15.240 align:start position:0%
even something where there's a
 
05:14:16.910 --> 05:14:16.920 align:start position:0%
possibility for a second opinion for
 
05:14:20.110 --> 05:14:20.120 align:start position:0%
those a challenge rejection uh to my
 
05:14:22.150 --> 05:14:22.160 align:start position:0%
understand I think the state gets $15
 
05:14:24.310 --> 05:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
per inspection so maybe something like a
 
05:14:27.270 --> 05:14:27.280 align:start position:0%
second opinion minus the $15 and the
 
05:14:29.390 --> 05:14:29.400 align:start position:0%
garage gets the balance just something
 
05:14:31.830 --> 05:14:31.840 align:start position:0%
to look at so having said all that I
 
05:14:34.510 --> 05:14:34.520 align:start position:0%
would support retaining so we could try
 
05:14:37.948 --> 05:14:37.958 align:start position:0%
to wrap our rounds around this beast and
 
05:14:40.390 --> 05:14:40.400 align:start position:0%
uh and and get get a process that isn't
 
05:14:42.708 --> 05:14:42.718 align:start position:0%
just going to blow it up entirely thank
 
05:14:46.830 --> 05:14:46.840 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair anybody else representative
 
05:14:51.750 --> 05:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
tyo thank you Mr chair um I did talk to
 
05:14:55.548 --> 05:14:55.558 align:start position:0%
uh some some constituents and people I
 
05:14:58.430 --> 05:14:58.440 align:start position:0%
know in the subject area yeah the I want
 
05:15:01.270 --> 05:15:01.280 align:start position:0%
to Echo what uh our vice chair said like
 
05:15:05.470 --> 05:15:05.480 align:start position:0%
it's overwhelming overwhelming support
 
05:15:08.070 --> 05:15:08.080 align:start position:0%
to get rid of our inspection program I
 
05:15:11.390 --> 05:15:11.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:13.590 --> 05:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
anybody else rips on foot thank you Mr
 
05:15:15.628 --> 05:15:15.638 align:start position:0%
chairman uh just to Echo what's already
 
05:15:17.670 --> 05:15:17.680 align:start position:0%
been said so uh like Vice chairman gski
 
05:15:20.788 --> 05:15:20.798 align:start position:0%
said so personally I I think it's a good
 
05:15:23.868 --> 05:15:23.878 align:start position:0%
idea to keep it just for personal um
 
05:15:27.510 --> 05:15:27.520 align:start position:0%
safety concerns by have but also has
 
05:15:30.190 --> 05:15:30.200 align:start position:0%
spoken to mechanics and uh constituents
 
05:15:32.390 --> 05:15:32.400 align:start position:0%
and whatnot so based on that
 
05:15:34.510 --> 05:15:34.520 align:start position:0%
overwhelming response that I've received
 
05:15:37.030 --> 05:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
personally in my my local constituents
 
05:15:40.190 --> 05:15:40.200 align:start position:0%
in my town um you know I I would move
 
05:15:43.628 --> 05:15:43.638 align:start position:0%
forward with passing this so thank
 
05:15:46.070 --> 05:15:46.080 align:start position:0%
you representative St
 
05:15:50.310 --> 05:15:50.320 align:start position:0%
Clair thank you Mr chair um I've made my
 
05:15:51.910 --> 05:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
thoughts on this
 
05:15:54.788 --> 05:15:54.798 align:start position:0%
situation as long as I've been here in
 
05:15:58.830 --> 05:15:58.840 align:start position:0%
transportation however um I think if we
 
05:16:01.868 --> 05:16:01.878 align:start position:0%
do pass this and somehow it gets through
 
05:16:03.750 --> 05:16:03.760 align:start position:0%
uh that and you correct me if I'm wrong
 
05:16:05.548 --> 05:16:05.558 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I don't think this would
 
05:16:07.910 --> 05:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
preclude us from another bill coming
 
05:16:09.590 --> 05:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
forward to
 
05:16:12.830 --> 05:16:12.840 align:start position:0%
uh perhaps reinstate the emissions under
 
05:16:15.270 --> 05:16:15.280 align:start position:0%
uh different you know another Bild to
 
05:16:18.470 --> 05:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
bring the emissions back U and have it
 
05:16:20.470 --> 05:16:20.480 align:start position:0%
tweaked so that it's uh maybe better
 
05:16:22.190 --> 05:16:22.200 align:start position:0%
than what we've got now I just just a
 
05:16:24.910 --> 05:16:24.920 align:start position:0%
thought I'm not
 
05:16:27.990 --> 05:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
sure not not this year I'm talking about
 
05:16:33.788 --> 05:16:33.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:33.798 --> 05:16:35.948 align:start position:0%
 
whenever

05:16:35.948 --> 05:16:35.958 align:start position:0%
whenever
 
05:16:40.868 --> 05:16:40.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:44.230 --> 05:16:44.240 align:start position:0%
sorry I wasn't even on uh anybody else
 
05:16:47.270 --> 05:16:47.280 align:start position:0%
second nobody else second bite represent
 
05:16:49.868 --> 05:16:49.878 align:start position:0%
guys thank you Mr chair so one of the
 
05:16:52.110 --> 05:16:52.120 align:start position:0%
reasons that I've uh I've been kind of
 
05:16:53.548 --> 05:16:53.558 align:start position:0%
attached to the idea of getting rid of
 
05:16:55.110 --> 05:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
this program you know people have said
 
05:16:57.350 --> 05:16:57.360 align:start position:0%
it needs to be tailored back that's true
 
05:16:59.150 --> 05:16:59.160 align:start position:0%
but I've talked with uh several members
 
05:17:01.030 --> 05:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
this of this committee that you know far
 
05:17:03.110 --> 05:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
predate me and when guardrails had
 
05:17:05.310 --> 05:17:05.320 align:start position:0%
attempted to be put in place through
 
05:17:07.948 --> 05:17:07.958 align:start position:0%
this body um they were not put in place
 
05:17:09.830 --> 05:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
um to the point where
 
05:17:11.628 --> 05:17:11.638 align:start position:0%
vehicles are being rejected for things
 
05:17:14.390 --> 05:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
like accessory lighting yeah not
 
05:17:16.628 --> 05:17:16.638 align:start position:0%
headlights not brake lights not turn
 
05:17:20.070 --> 05:17:20.080 align:start position:0%
signals accessory lighting um we have
 
05:17:22.708 --> 05:17:22.718 align:start position:0%
gotten so far away from safety by people
 
05:17:24.830 --> 05:17:24.840 align:start position:0%
being able to write their own safe C
 
05:17:26.948 --> 05:17:26.958 align:start position:0%
codes and rules either through jail car
 
05:17:28.430 --> 05:17:28.440 align:start position:0%
or just through prudent application of
 
05:17:30.708 --> 05:17:30.718 align:start position:0%
the law that the only way to put a good
 
05:17:32.670 --> 05:17:32.680 align:start position:0%
program in place in my opinion is to get
 
05:17:34.948 --> 05:17:34.958 align:start position:0%
rid of this entire program and either
 
05:17:36.910 --> 05:17:36.920 align:start position:0%
decide that we need to start over with
 
05:17:40.230 --> 05:17:40.240 align:start position:0%
new guard rails or decide that like the
 
05:17:42.910 --> 05:17:42.920 align:start position:0%
other 39 States this is nothing more
 
05:17:44.670 --> 05:17:44.680 align:start position:0%
than pushing money into the private
 
05:17:47.788 --> 05:17:47.798 align:start position:0%
Market under the threat of
 
05:17:50.590 --> 05:17:50.600 align:start position:0%
government anybody
 
05:17:53.310 --> 05:17:53.320 align:start position:0%
else second representative Miller uh
 
05:17:54.830 --> 05:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
just one last point to representative St
 
05:17:58.868 --> 05:17:58.878 align:start position:0%
Clair's idea of uh passing this now and
 
05:18:01.470 --> 05:18:01.480 align:start position:0%
coming back with a new bill later to fix
 
05:18:04.670 --> 05:18:04.680 align:start position:0%
things um there's an old yish stting
 
05:18:06.708 --> 05:18:06.718 align:start position:0%
that I probably shouldn't repeat uh in
 
05:18:10.030 --> 05:18:10.040 align:start position:0%
public but uh it it's a nice dream that
 
05:18:12.750 --> 05:18:12.760 align:start position:0%
that would work I would I think we would
 
05:18:16.150 --> 05:18:16.160 align:start position:0%
be it would be more responsible to uh
 
05:18:17.590 --> 05:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
make adjustments in a way that we know
 
05:18:20.190 --> 05:18:20.200 align:start position:0%
that we're not destroying the situation
 
05:18:22.590 --> 05:18:22.600 align:start position:0%
and not having a chance and and hoping
 
05:18:24.310 --> 05:18:24.320 align:start position:0%
that we can fix it later rather fix it
 
05:18:27.670 --> 05:18:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:30.510 --> 05:18:30.520 align:start position:0%
time representative pondon thank you Mr
 
05:18:32.910 --> 05:18:32.920 align:start position:0%
chair very briefly just a reminder
 
05:18:35.750 --> 05:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
should this pass it puts safety
 
05:18:38.470 --> 05:18:38.480 align:start position:0%
inspections on the shoulders of our
 
05:18:40.830 --> 05:18:40.840 align:start position:0%
police police are underand and overwork
 
05:18:45.110 --> 05:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
police and and State Police who they can
 
05:18:46.628 --> 05:18:46.638 align:start position:0%
look at the surface of the vehicle but
 
05:18:48.310 --> 05:18:48.320 align:start position:0%
they're not going to be able to check
 
05:18:51.270 --> 05:18:51.280 align:start position:0%
brakes and so on but that it's it's
 
05:18:53.350 --> 05:18:53.360 align:start position:0%
going to be on the law enforcement to
 
05:18:56.190 --> 05:18:56.200 align:start position:0%
check safety issues thank
 
05:18:58.628 --> 05:18:58.638 align:start position:0%
you anybody
 
05:19:00.990 --> 05:19:01.000 align:start position:0%
else I'll give you a third bite
 
05:19:01.000 --> 05:19:02.270 align:start position:0%
else I'll give you a third bite
represent

05:19:02.270 --> 05:19:02.280 align:start position:0%
represent
 
05:19:04.708 --> 05:19:04.718 align:start position:0%
gon I respectfully think that that's not
 
05:19:07.670 --> 05:19:07.680 align:start position:0%
the case in other states that have no
 
05:19:09.350 --> 05:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
inspection laws the police are not
 
05:19:12.390 --> 05:19:12.400 align:start position:0%
expected to be um anything beyond their
 
05:19:15.590 --> 05:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
scope of Duty of incident inspectors and
 
05:19:18.990 --> 05:19:19.000 align:start position:0%
me having a birthday of February 6th if
 
05:19:21.150 --> 05:19:21.160 align:start position:0%
I have an accident right now and there's
 
05:19:23.390 --> 05:19:23.400 align:start position:0%
a suspicion that there is bad equipment
 
05:19:25.350 --> 05:19:25.360 align:start position:0%
it's not because of my safety inspection
 
05:19:26.750 --> 05:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
from last year it's because there's
 
05:19:29.230 --> 05:19:29.240 align:start position:0%
suspicion of bad equipment um I can tell
 
05:19:31.190 --> 05:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
you if you get pulled over in Kansas the
 
05:19:32.670 --> 05:19:32.680 align:start position:0%
police are not going underneath your car
 
05:19:34.750 --> 05:19:34.760 align:start position:0%
to check your brake pads they are doing
 
05:19:36.150 --> 05:19:36.160 align:start position:0%
the same walk around that they do here
 
05:19:38.150 --> 05:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
for your safety and theirs they're
 
05:19:40.470 --> 05:19:40.480 align:start position:0%
applying the the application of the law
 
05:19:42.310 --> 05:19:42.320 align:start position:0%
and in a post accident that's a post-
 
05:19:45.150 --> 05:19:45.160 align:start position:0%
accident investigation that is totally
 
05:19:46.910 --> 05:19:46.920 align:start position:0%
separate from a vehicle inspection so it
 
05:19:52.030 --> 05:19:52.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:54.830 --> 05:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
police represent St Clair your name was
 
05:19:58.510 --> 05:19:58.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned go ahead thank you um I want
 
05:20:03.190 --> 05:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
to assure everybody um that should this
 
05:20:08.310 --> 05:20:08.320 align:start position:0%
inspection um disappear that if anything
 
05:20:10.868 --> 05:20:10.878 align:start position:0%
when you going to get an oil change or
 
05:20:12.708 --> 05:20:12.718 align:start position:0%
get a light change because most of the
 
05:20:14.190 --> 05:20:14.200 align:start position:0%
vehicles now you cannot change light
 
05:20:16.910 --> 05:20:16.920 align:start position:0%
bulbs on your own without special tools
 
05:20:20.110 --> 05:20:20.120 align:start position:0%
that the service stations or dealerships
 
05:20:22.590 --> 05:20:22.600 align:start position:0%
will be in fact looking for other things
 
05:20:24.910 --> 05:20:24.920 align:start position:0%
to inform you that hey by the way I'm
 
05:20:27.070 --> 05:20:27.080 align:start position:0%
underneath your vehicle uh to get the
 
05:20:29.390 --> 05:20:29.400 align:start position:0%
oil pan out or whatever and I've noticed
 
05:20:31.070 --> 05:20:31.080 align:start position:0%
that your frame has got some Rust over
 
05:20:33.230 --> 05:20:33.240 align:start position:0%
here we definitely should be looking at
 
05:20:36.350 --> 05:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
it your brake pads don't look good this
 
05:20:38.628 --> 05:20:38.638 align:start position:0%
this whatever even even the the quick
 
05:20:40.948 --> 05:20:40.958 align:start position:0%
quick oil change places are constantly
 
05:20:42.590 --> 05:20:42.600 align:start position:0%
looking at stuff that they can sell you
 
05:20:44.750 --> 05:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
and I get that and so I don't think
 
05:20:46.070 --> 05:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
that's going to disappear if anything
 
05:20:49.628 --> 05:20:49.638 align:start position:0%
it'll increase and uh that will help
 
05:20:52.310 --> 05:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
people uh know about the stuff that
 
05:20:54.708 --> 05:20:54.718 align:start position:0%
they're being told now thank
 
05:20:56.628 --> 05:20:56.638 align:start position:0%
you anybody
 
05:20:58.910 --> 05:20:58.920 align:start position:0%
else all right seeing that I'm just
 
05:21:01.310 --> 05:21:01.320 align:start position:0%
going to say something briefly on it
 
05:21:04.910 --> 05:21:04.920 align:start position:0%
having the um benefit
 
05:21:07.150 --> 05:21:07.160 align:start position:0%
or the benefit of dealing with this for
 
05:21:09.788 --> 05:21:09.798 align:start position:0%
12 years I get three words open up my my
 
05:21:13.788 --> 05:21:13.798 align:start position:0%
my thoughts on this enough is enough for
 
05:21:15.750 --> 05:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
12 years I've been defending this
 
05:21:18.150 --> 05:21:18.160 align:start position:0%
program for 12 years we've been seeking
 
05:21:20.628 --> 05:21:20.638 align:start position:0%
all the negative impacts uh that that
 
05:21:21.910 --> 05:21:21.920 align:start position:0%
might happen if we get rid of the
 
05:21:23.990 --> 05:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
program including how many Highway funds
 
05:21:25.670 --> 05:21:25.680 align:start position:0%
we might be getting and we have never
 
05:21:28.230 --> 05:21:28.240 align:start position:0%
gotten an answer three years ago
 
05:21:29.868 --> 05:21:29.878 align:start position:0%
actually in 2018 we first started
 
05:21:31.110 --> 05:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
looking at putting the reasons for
 
05:21:33.350 --> 05:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
failure into statute by dealing with
 
05:21:35.788 --> 05:21:35.798 align:start position:0%
rust from what I understand that still
 
05:21:37.590 --> 05:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
hasn't been updated in the Gordon Derby
 
05:21:39.350 --> 05:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
system and I'm hearing people still are
 
05:21:41.948 --> 05:21:41.958 align:start position:0%
getting failed for R issues even though
 
05:21:44.430 --> 05:21:44.440 align:start position:0%
we put it in statute last year we
 
05:21:46.350 --> 05:21:46.360 align:start position:0%
decided to take a handful of simple
 
05:21:48.910 --> 05:21:48.920 align:start position:0%
things that we all agree bipartisanly
 
05:21:51.910 --> 05:21:51.920 align:start position:0%
that shouldn't be reason for failure and
 
05:21:53.868 --> 05:21:53.878 align:start position:0%
what happened it was met with resistance
 
05:21:56.270 --> 05:21:56.280 align:start position:0%
to its Ultimate Death I told people
 
05:21:57.990 --> 05:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
three years ago we either going to make
 
05:21:59.750 --> 05:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
people hate this less or you're going to
 
05:22:01.270 --> 05:22:01.280 align:start position:0%
lose my support for it and I'll start
 
05:22:02.670 --> 05:22:02.680 align:start position:0%
doing everything I can to see it
 
05:22:06.110 --> 05:22:06.120 align:start position:0%
repealed here we are now on ter in terms
 
05:22:08.110 --> 05:22:08.120 align:start position:0%
of the rules we've mentioned that I
 
05:22:09.430 --> 05:22:09.440 align:start position:0%
forgot the to bring them in but I do
 
05:22:11.510 --> 05:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
have a set in my desk they are literally
 
05:22:14.628 --> 05:22:14.638 align:start position:0%
over a quarter inch thick on 8 1/2 by 11
 
05:22:17.470 --> 05:22:17.480 align:start position:0%
sheets of paper in print that you need a
 
05:22:19.868 --> 05:22:19.878 align:start position:0%
a magnifying glass to read that's what
 
05:22:22.788 --> 05:22:22.798 align:start position:0%
this program has turned into and if this
 
05:22:24.670 --> 05:22:24.680 align:start position:0%
does disappear if this does make it
 
05:22:26.230 --> 05:22:26.240 align:start position:0%
through this committee and the house and
 
05:22:28.230 --> 05:22:28.240 align:start position:0%
the Senate and get a signature if it
 
05:22:29.910 --> 05:22:29.920 align:start position:0%
ever needed to come back in the future
 
05:22:31.590 --> 05:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
if we saw all of a sudden data
 
05:22:33.948 --> 05:22:33.958 align:start position:0%
miraculously occur or come out of
 
05:22:35.430 --> 05:22:35.440 align:start position:0%
existence that yeah I guess it did make
 
05:22:38.628 --> 05:22:38.638 align:start position:0%
a difference well then maybe the next in
 
05:22:42.390 --> 05:22:42.400 align:start position:0%
uh um uh inspection program doesn't have
 
05:22:45.430 --> 05:22:45.440 align:start position:0%
RSA 541a attached to it and that any
 
05:22:47.548 --> 05:22:47.558 align:start position:0%
reason for failure in the future will be
 
05:22:51.430 --> 05:22:51.440 align:start position:0%
in statute not in a encyclopedia that
 
05:22:54.230 --> 05:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
deals with this one topic for that I
 
05:22:56.510 --> 05:22:56.520 align:start position:0%
will be supporting and ought to pass and
 
05:22:59.270 --> 05:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
I ask the committee to do the same that
 
05:23:01.948 --> 05:23:01.958 align:start position:0%
being said I'll ask the clerk to call
 
05:23:04.190 --> 05:23:04.200 align:start position:0%
the rule when she's ready the motion is
 
05:23:10.948 --> 05:23:10.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:14.310 --> 05:23:14.320 align:start position:0%

05:23:51.628 --> 05:23:51.638 align:start position:0%
yes8 to
 
05:23:54.788 --> 05:23:54.798 align:start position:0%
eight how did I know that was going to
 
05:23:57.350 --> 05:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
happen Okay the motion fails a motion
 
05:23:59.628 --> 05:23:59.638 align:start position:0%
about the pass fails
 
05:24:03.590 --> 05:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:10.350 --> 05:24:10.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:11.670 --> 05:24:11.680 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
05:24:13.990 --> 05:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
V thank you Mr chairman I move that we
 
05:24:16.270 --> 05:24:16.280 align:start position:0%
retain HB
 
05:24:19.708 --> 05:24:19.718 align:start position:0%
649 motions to retain is there a second
 
05:24:22.390 --> 05:24:22.400 align:start position:0%
I'll second it second by representative
 
05:24:30.670 --> 05:24:30.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:34.548 --> 05:24:34.558 align:start position:0%
motion wasn't uh just very quickly I
 
05:24:37.190 --> 05:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
already said why I want to retain it um
 
05:24:39.830 --> 05:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
just to make sure we're crossing all our
 
05:24:41.910 --> 05:24:41.920 align:start position:0%
tees and dotting the eyes and not
 
05:24:45.310 --> 05:24:45.320 align:start position:0%
creating unintended consequences and
 
05:24:45.320 --> 05:24:46.430 align:start position:0%
creating unintended consequences and
that's

05:24:46.430 --> 05:24:46.440 align:start position:0%
that's
 
05:24:49.390 --> 05:24:49.400 align:start position:0%
it anybody else on the routin
 
05:24:52.150 --> 05:24:52.160 align:start position:0%
representative pondon yes and to to
 
05:24:56.070 --> 05:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
clarify um on my point earlier uh
 
05:24:58.670 --> 05:24:58.680 align:start position:0%
regarding New Hampshire not Kansas and
 
05:25:02.510 --> 05:25:02.520 align:start position:0%
per uh Sergeant retired Sergeant Chase
 
05:25:04.270 --> 05:25:04.280 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire State Police the
 
05:25:07.110 --> 05:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
memo he sent us who he did oversee
 
05:25:08.910 --> 05:25:08.920 align:start position:0%
inspections in New Hampshire
 
05:25:12.830 --> 05:25:12.840 align:start position:0%
under title 21 chapter 266 enforcement
 
05:25:14.750 --> 05:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
and unsafe Vehicles would be performed
 
05:25:17.670 --> 05:25:17.680 align:start position:0%
on a daily basis by Troopers and police
 
05:25:21.310 --> 05:25:21.320 align:start position:0%
officers and quote so I do think it does
 
05:25:25.390 --> 05:25:25.400 align:start position:0%
put the burden on our law enforcement to
 
05:25:27.670 --> 05:25:27.680 align:start position:0%
for safety so that's why we need to look
 
05:25:29.910 --> 05:25:29.920 align:start position:0%
at this okay so that's your that's your
 
05:25:31.788 --> 05:25:31.798 align:start position:0%
reasoning for retain yes it is that's my
 
05:25:34.070 --> 05:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
reason is that is the motion anybody
 
05:25:36.350 --> 05:25:36.360 align:start position:0%
else on the motion to
 
05:25:38.948 --> 05:25:38.958 align:start position:0%
retain represent PES
 
05:25:41.230 --> 05:25:41.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman yeah I would urge
 
05:25:44.310 --> 05:25:44.320 align:start position:0%
the committee to uh support the retain
 
05:25:46.830 --> 05:25:46.840 align:start position:0%
motion it it it will give us an
 
05:25:49.430 --> 05:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity to take a look at some of
 
05:25:51.110 --> 05:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
the things that everybody's been talking
 
05:25:53.190 --> 05:25:53.200 align:start position:0%
about and you it may be at the end of
 
05:25:56.110 --> 05:25:56.120 align:start position:0%
the day that we can't come to a any
 
05:25:58.030 --> 05:25:58.040 align:start position:0%
better solution than we have to this
 
05:26:01.110 --> 05:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
point but at least we will have given it
 
05:26:06.270 --> 05:26:06.280 align:start position:0%
um more more of an effort than um than
 
05:26:07.868 --> 05:26:07.878 align:start position:0%
we have in the past and I think it's
 
05:26:09.830 --> 05:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
just I think it's the right thing to do
 
05:26:13.430 --> 05:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
it's an opportunity possibly to to meld
 
05:26:15.190 --> 05:26:15.200 align:start position:0%
the two different bills that we've
 
05:26:17.628 --> 05:26:17.638 align:start position:0%
retained maybe we end up with just a
 
05:26:20.190 --> 05:26:20.200 align:start position:0%
recommendation of only one bill you know
 
05:26:22.030 --> 05:26:22.040 align:start position:0%
which can't happen it comes out of
 
05:26:24.470 --> 05:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
committee with a recommendation to kill
 
05:26:27.270 --> 05:26:27.280 align:start position:0%
one and keep the other um that that is
 
05:26:29.350 --> 05:26:29.360 align:start position:0%
not beyond the realm of possibility so I
 
05:26:31.868 --> 05:26:31.878 align:start position:0%
would urge you all to support
 
05:26:36.310 --> 05:26:36.320 align:start position:0%
retain anybody else representative gon I
 
05:26:38.470 --> 05:26:38.480 align:start position:0%
don't think I can support the retain
 
05:26:41.310 --> 05:26:41.320 align:start position:0%
because with the amount of the people
 
05:26:42.990 --> 05:26:43.000 align:start position:0%
that we represent not the businesses but
 
05:26:44.390 --> 05:26:44.400 align:start position:0%
the people that have screamed that they
 
05:26:46.670 --> 05:26:46.680 align:start position:0%
want this program gone I believe that it
 
05:26:48.390 --> 05:26:48.400 align:start position:0%
deserves a floor fight for a chance to
 
05:26:50.030 --> 05:26:50.040 align:start position:0%
get rid of this program I believe it's
 
05:26:50.040 --> 05:26:51.230 align:start position:0%
get rid of this program I believe it's
that

05:26:51.230 --> 05:26:51.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:26:53.670 --> 05:26:53.680 align:start position:0%
bad I'll chime in now saying I agree
 
05:26:57.470 --> 05:26:57.480 align:start position:0%
with you 100% um we've retained one in
 
05:27:00.110 --> 05:27:00.120 align:start position:0%
case this has a an ill
 
05:27:02.548 --> 05:27:02.558 align:start position:0%
demise but I would rather see this go to
 
05:27:06.030 --> 05:27:06.040 align:start position:0%
the full house uh with no recommendation
 
05:27:07.670 --> 05:27:07.680 align:start position:0%
than to retain two bills on the same
 
05:27:09.708 --> 05:27:09.718 align:start position:0%
subject I don't see where that makes any
 
05:27:11.628 --> 05:27:11.638 align:start position:0%
sense I don't know what we're going to
 
05:27:13.470 --> 05:27:13.480 align:start position:0%
fix of it it seems like we're looking at
 
05:27:17.030 --> 05:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
retain is a reason to silently kill this
 
05:27:19.910 --> 05:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
just because some may disagree with it
 
05:27:23.910 --> 05:27:23.920 align:start position:0%
um I don't see why retaining two
 
05:27:26.230 --> 05:27:26.240 align:start position:0%
helps that being said I'm going to ask
 
05:27:27.670 --> 05:27:27.680 align:start position:0%
the clerk to call the role when she's
 
05:27:30.548 --> 05:27:30.558 align:start position:0%
ready the motion is to retain House Bill
 
05:27:33.868 --> 05:27:33.878 align:start position:0%
649 can I just ask one question so if we
 
05:27:37.150 --> 05:27:37.160 align:start position:0%
vote not to retain it then it goes well
 
05:27:39.708 --> 05:27:39.718 align:start position:0%
then back is not a recommendation no
 
05:27:42.910 --> 05:27:42.920 align:start position:0%
we'll need one more motion for
 
05:27:46.590 --> 05:27:46.600 align:start position:0%
itl in another debate and if that
 
05:27:48.948 --> 05:27:48.958 align:start position:0%
fails then we could then it'll go to the
 
05:27:51.190 --> 05:27:51.200 align:start position:0%
floor with no recommendation so we're
 
05:27:53.788 --> 05:27:53.798 align:start position:0%
still one if this fails we're one motion
 
05:27:57.510 --> 05:27:57.520 align:start position:0%
away from going to the
 
05:28:01.708 --> 05:28:01.718 align:start position:0%
floor does that help I guess
 
05:28:06.270 --> 05:28:06.280 align:start position:0%
so I'm not sure doesn't make her happy
 
05:28:09.708 --> 05:28:09.718 align:start position:0%
no okay okay so the motion is to retain
 
05:28:16.708 --> 05:28:16.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:18.708 --> 05:28:18.718 align:start position:0%
no oh the
 
05:28:18.718 --> 05:28:20.310 align:start position:0%
no oh the
clerk

no
 
05:29:09.190 --> 05:29:09.200 align:start position:0%
8 okay so the motion to retain fails 8
 
05:29:11.948 --> 05:29:11.958 align:start position:0%
to8 we've only got one more motion left
 
05:29:14.830 --> 05:29:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:19.110 --> 05:29:19.120 align:start position:0%

05:30:38.868 --> 05:30:38.878 align:start position:0%
a okay so the motion inexperience to
 
05:30:41.670 --> 05:30:41.680 align:start position:0%
legislate fails 8 to8 with no other
 
05:30:44.788 --> 05:30:44.798 align:start position:0%
options to our at our disposal this will
 
05:30:47.830 --> 05:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
go to the floor with no recommendation
 
05:30:50.030 --> 05:30:50.040 align:start position:0%
I'm sure do I have
 
05:30:54.030 --> 05:30:54.040 align:start position:0%
a mo what a report in favor
 
05:30:56.830 --> 05:30:56.840 align:start position:0%
of uh that's up to me to decide what the
 
05:30:58.030 --> 05:30:58.040 align:start position:0%
motion's going to be on the floor it's
 
05:31:03.670 --> 05:31:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:05.868 --> 05:31:05.878 align:start position:0%
pass let me clarify with our Deputy
 
05:31:07.628 --> 05:31:07.638 align:start position:0%
speaker because I know we changed some
 
05:31:09.548 --> 05:31:09.558 align:start position:0%
rules this year when it comes out of
 
05:31:12.788 --> 05:31:12.798 align:start position:0%
here tide do I get I get to declare the
 
05:31:13.990 --> 05:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
first motion
 
05:31:17.230 --> 05:31:17.240 align:start position:0%
correct yes so rather than majority and
 
05:31:19.430 --> 05:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
minority reports since there are no you
 
05:31:22.990 --> 05:31:23.000 align:start position:0%
have a statement and support of OTP a
 
05:31:25.350 --> 05:31:25.360 align:start position:0%
statement and support of itl and you
 
05:31:26.868 --> 05:31:26.878 align:start position:0%
have to pick which one goes first on the
 
05:31:26.878 --> 05:31:35.230 align:start position:0%
have to pick which one goes first on the
floor

05:31:35.230 --> 05:31:35.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:41.110 --> 05:31:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:43.270 --> 05:31:43.280 align:start position:0%
recommendation so just to clarify that
 
05:31:44.750 --> 05:31:44.760 align:start position:0%
if I declare that not to pass is going
 
05:31:47.310 --> 05:31:47.320 align:start position:0%
to be the opening motion the same
 
05:31:49.190 --> 05:31:49.200 align:start position:0%
parliamentary rules work when we get on
 
05:31:52.990 --> 05:31:53.000 align:start position:0%
the floor in terms of who speaks first
 
05:31:55.590 --> 05:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
okay then not to pass will be the motion
 
05:31:57.990 --> 05:31:58.000 align:start position:0%
so we'll be looking for report for an a
 
05:32:01.390 --> 05:32:01.400 align:start position:0%
to pass and for an
 
05:32:04.310 --> 05:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
itl and that'll be an itl from from you
 
05:32:06.390 --> 05:32:06.400 align:start position:0%
okay all right I'll close the executive
 
05:32:09.310 --> 05:32:09.320 align:start position:0%
session on House Bill 6
 
05:32:13.510 --> 05:32:13.520 align:start position:0%
49 that was easy um next need to do not
 
05:32:30.030 --> 05:32:30.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:31.948 --> 05:32:31.958 align:start position:0%
anything uh next up we'll be getting
 
05:32:36.830 --> 05:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:36.840 --> 05:33:06.750 align:start position:0%
 
7:15

05:33:06.750 --> 05:33:06.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:06.760 --> 05:33:36.708 align:start position:0%
 
e

05:33:36.708 --> 05:33:36.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:22.430 --> 05:34:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:23.510 --> 05:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
all right I'm going to open up the
 
05:34:26.868 --> 05:34:26.878 align:start position:0%
executive session on House Bill 7115
 
05:34:29.830 --> 05:34:29.840 align:start position:0%

05:34:31.590 --> 05:34:31.600 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative hamler
 
05:34:31.600 --> 05:34:36.390 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative hamler
for

05:34:36.390 --> 05:34:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:38.708 --> 05:34:38.718 align:start position:0%
motion and expedient the legislator has
 
05:34:40.670 --> 05:34:40.680 align:start position:0%
been moved on 7:15 there's there a
 
05:34:43.350 --> 05:34:43.360 align:start position:0%
second seconded by representative foot
 
05:34:45.868 --> 05:34:45.878 align:start position:0%
care to speak your motion
 
05:34:49.830 --> 05:34:49.840 align:start position:0%
sir very briefly thank you uh yes so I
 
05:34:52.868 --> 05:34:52.878 align:start position:0%
had some problems with this bill um as
 
05:34:55.948 --> 05:34:55.958 align:start position:0%
far as things such as enforcement on
 
05:34:59.910 --> 05:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
these uh we're talking about rail Trails
 
05:35:03.510 --> 05:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
off-roading um are we pulling police
 
05:35:07.310 --> 05:35:07.320 align:start position:0%
officers off our roads to you know be on
 
05:35:10.230 --> 05:35:10.240 align:start position:0%
the is BET in the woods you know
 
05:35:11.868 --> 05:35:11.878 align:start position:0%
monitoring speed how are they going to
 
05:35:14.150 --> 05:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
do this I also have a problem with the
 
05:35:17.230 --> 05:35:17.240 align:start position:0%
fact that uh it was recommended in here
 
05:35:20.750 --> 05:35:20.760 align:start position:0%
that persons 16 years or older have a
 
05:35:23.948 --> 05:35:23.958 align:start position:0%
license however if you're 15 you don't
 
05:35:26.030 --> 05:35:26.040 align:start position:0%
not need a license to operate the same
 
05:35:29.150 --> 05:35:29.160 align:start position:0%
Vehicles so for that I vote
 
05:35:33.670 --> 05:35:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:37.750 --> 05:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
committee representative B
 
05:35:41.270 --> 05:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
um I completely agree that this is not
 
05:35:44.230 --> 05:35:44.240 align:start position:0%
in its best form
 
05:35:47.350 --> 05:35:47.360 align:start position:0%
uh that this bill is unworkable as it is
 
05:35:50.470 --> 05:35:50.480 align:start position:0%
but I do think we need to have a
 
05:35:53.070 --> 05:35:53.080 align:start position:0%
definition uh hearing people being
 
05:35:55.470 --> 05:35:55.480 align:start position:0%
encouraged to PE people who are have
 
05:35:56.948 --> 05:35:56.958 align:start position:0%
their license suspended for DUI being
 
05:35:59.030 --> 05:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
encouraged to get one of these vehicles
 
05:36:01.910 --> 05:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
that go 30 40 50 miles an hour to get
 
05:36:05.150 --> 05:36:05.160 align:start position:0%
around the law that that kind of bothers
 
05:36:08.190 --> 05:36:08.200 align:start position:0%
me so I I think we need something this
 
05:36:10.708 --> 05:36:10.718 align:start position:0%
is definitely not it so I don't know if
 
05:36:13.070 --> 05:36:13.080 align:start position:0%
we need to how we approach that if we
 
05:36:16.590 --> 05:36:16.600 align:start position:0%
itl this how can't come back next year
 
05:36:20.750 --> 05:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
but can we you know how do we if we do
 
05:36:22.070 --> 05:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
come up with something a better
 
05:36:23.670 --> 05:36:23.680 align:start position:0%
definition something along those lines
 
05:36:32.070 --> 05:36:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:34.990 --> 05:36:35.000 align:start position:0%
that no you're right I mean you are
 
05:36:38.190 --> 05:36:38.200 align:start position:0%
right if we do itl it it can't come
 
05:36:42.350 --> 05:36:42.360 align:start position:0%
back um for the remainder of this term I
 
05:36:44.990 --> 05:36:45.000 align:start position:0%
was going to suggest myself uh because
 
05:36:48.310 --> 05:36:48.320 align:start position:0%
even the people testifying to this bill
 
05:36:50.628 --> 05:36:50.638 align:start position:0%
admitted that it had its issues and
 
05:36:51.990 --> 05:36:52.000 align:start position:0%
we're hoping that we could turn this
 
05:36:54.390 --> 05:36:54.400 align:start position:0%
into a study committee and I'm not
 
05:36:55.788 --> 05:36:55.798 align:start position:0%
turning it into a study committee
 
05:36:58.390 --> 05:36:58.400 align:start position:0%
because I believe uh they could use the
 
05:37:00.310 --> 05:37:00.320 align:start position:0%
same bill that that we were going to use
 
05:37:02.190 --> 05:37:02.200 align:start position:0%
as a template and do an ADH heart
 
05:37:04.030 --> 05:37:04.040 align:start position:0%
committee without going through the
 
05:37:06.628 --> 05:37:06.638 align:start position:0%
whole rigma rooll and the whole process
 
05:37:08.190 --> 05:37:08.200 align:start position:0%
but you do raise money one good question
 
05:37:10.750 --> 05:37:10.760 align:start position:0%
one good point if we once we itl it it's
 
05:37:16.708 --> 05:37:16.718 align:start position:0%
done for this term so uh I go ahead so
 
05:37:19.430 --> 05:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
if we itl it a germine bill that does
 
05:37:20.948 --> 05:37:20.958 align:start position:0%
this is done for this term but they were
 
05:37:23.230 --> 05:37:23.240 align:start position:0%
also suggesting a class that doesn't
 
05:37:25.190 --> 05:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
exist yet that may be being written by a
 
05:37:27.910 --> 05:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
college among other things if we wanted
 
05:37:29.788 --> 05:37:29.798 align:start position:0%
to put forward a non-gain bill that
 
05:37:32.110 --> 05:37:32.120 align:start position:0%
defined what an electric vehicle was and
 
05:37:35.590 --> 05:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
did not have all of the stuff in this in
 
05:37:38.030 --> 05:37:38.040 align:start position:0%
your opinion as the chair would that be
 
05:37:39.470 --> 05:37:39.480 align:start position:0%
different enough that we could do that
 
05:37:40.948 --> 05:37:40.958 align:start position:0%
though well it would certainly be
 
05:37:42.070 --> 05:37:42.080 align:start position:0%
different enough that I would ask the
 
05:37:44.230 --> 05:37:44.240 align:start position:0%
speaker to give us his Blessing On It
 
05:37:46.590 --> 05:37:46.600 align:start position:0%
ultimately he has the the say on gerain
 
05:37:49.070 --> 05:37:49.080 align:start position:0%
this um unless you want to chime in on
 
05:37:51.390 --> 05:37:51.400 align:start position:0%
on but it's a good point it's to me it
 
05:37:54.150 --> 05:37:54.160 align:start position:0%
seems separate enough um but again I
 
05:37:57.430 --> 05:37:57.440 align:start position:0%
don't get the final the final say on
 
05:38:01.470 --> 05:38:01.480 align:start position:0%
that okay the usual I I get $10 for
 
05:38:03.750 --> 05:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
dispensing this
 
05:38:08.788 --> 05:38:08.798 align:start position:0%
advice all right so and looking at this
 
05:38:13.070 --> 05:38:13.080 align:start position:0%
nice a new section I always hate that
 
05:38:16.270 --> 05:38:16.280 align:start position:0%
but I'm wondering why we didn't
 
05:38:19.150 --> 05:38:19.160 align:start position:0%
include these changes in
 
05:38:24.150 --> 05:38:24.160 align:start position:0%
the electric personal assistive Mobility
 
05:38:27.830 --> 05:38:27.840 align:start position:0%
device chapter I think I got that right
 
05:38:30.590 --> 05:38:30.600 align:start position:0%
which sounds like oh scooters right now
 
05:38:33.350 --> 05:38:33.360 align:start position:0%
Segways it's a Segway statute I mean I'm
 
05:38:35.350 --> 05:38:35.360 align:start position:0%
reading this thing it's about driving on
 
05:38:37.948 --> 05:38:37.958 align:start position:0%
sidewalks and everything it seems like
 
05:38:39.910 --> 05:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
it might apply more to that so if you
 
05:38:45.190 --> 05:38:45.200 align:start position:0%
itl this puppy but then update the epam
 
05:38:48.070 --> 05:38:48.080 align:start position:0%
statute whatever that is that seems
 
05:38:50.190 --> 05:38:50.200 align:start position:0%
pretty different to me and you can sell
 
05:38:54.910 --> 05:38:54.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:57.788 --> 05:38:57.798 align:start position:0%
it you get that if something comes up I
 
05:38:59.110 --> 05:38:59.120 align:start position:0%
think we have good chances of getting
 
05:39:00.830 --> 05:39:00.840 align:start position:0%
something introduced so long as it's not
 
05:39:03.830 --> 05:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
similar anybody else uh on the
 
05:39:06.310 --> 05:39:06.320 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate motion on
 
05:39:09.110 --> 05:39:09.120 align:start position:0%
7:15 see I'll ask the clerk to call the

yes 14-
 
05:40:00.910 --> 05:40:00.920 align:start position:0%
two okay our recommendation of
 
05:40:03.350 --> 05:40:03.360 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate on 7:15 is
 
05:40:04.750 --> 05:40:04.760 align:start position:0%
adopt at
 
05:40:10.948 --> 05:40:10.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:15.750 --> 05:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
break can I finish my sentence y okay um
 
05:40:16.830 --> 05:40:16.840 align:start position:0%
where was
 
05:40:18.948 --> 05:40:18.958 align:start position:0%
I oh uh
 
05:40:23.708 --> 05:40:23.718 align:start position:0%
142 we're cusp on whether or not we want
 
05:40:26.830 --> 05:40:26.840 align:start position:0%
to see consent any motions for consent
 
05:40:29.510 --> 05:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
any objections to consent you you were
 
05:40:31.390 --> 05:40:31.400 align:start position:0%
opposing what's your what's your you
 
05:40:32.708 --> 05:40:32.718 align:start position:0%
going to fight
 
05:40:35.390 --> 05:40:35.400 align:start position:0%
this no objection to consent if I can
 
05:40:36.830 --> 05:40:36.840 align:start position:0%
get a motion for consent then that's why
 
05:40:38.150 --> 05:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
we'll put it
 
05:40:40.910 --> 05:40:40.920 align:start position:0%
okay consent that is I'll close the
 
05:40:40.920 --> 05:40:42.070 align:start position:0%
okay consent that is I'll close the
what's

05:40:42.070 --> 05:40:42.080 align:start position:0%
what's
 
05:40:46.750 --> 05:40:46.760 align:start position:0%
up no no problem I'll close you I'll
 
05:41:06.230 --> 05:41:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:06.240 --> 05:41:36.230 align:start position:0%

session on House Bill
 
05:51:49.990 --> 05:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
305 relative to speed and red light
 
05:51:52.190 --> 05:51:52.200 align:start position:0%
cameras for traffic enforcement chair
 
05:51:54.350 --> 05:51:54.360 align:start position:0%
recogniz as representative
 
05:51:57.110 --> 05:51:57.120 align:start position:0%
gon thank you Mr chair I'm going to move
 
05:51:59.350 --> 05:51:59.360 align:start position:0%
itl on House Bill
 
05:52:01.548 --> 05:52:01.558 align:start position:0%
305 uh motion is inexpedient to
 
05:52:03.990 --> 05:52:04.000 align:start position:0%
legislate on House Bill 305 is there a
 
05:52:07.390 --> 05:52:07.400 align:start position:0%
second second seconded by represent pill
 
05:52:10.310 --> 05:52:10.320 align:start position:0%
can to speak to your motion sir yes sir
 
05:52:13.150 --> 05:52:13.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so we heard about the
 
05:52:15.070 --> 05:52:15.080 align:start position:0%
implementation of these traffic cameras
 
05:52:17.350 --> 05:52:17.360 align:start position:0%
for for traffic enforcement and highrisk
 
05:52:19.830 --> 05:52:19.840 align:start position:0%
intersections Etc um when we were asked
 
05:52:21.430 --> 05:52:21.440 align:start position:0%
how they would identify the driver one
 
05:52:23.468 --> 05:52:23.478 align:start position:0%
of the uh one of the comments was
 
05:52:25.910 --> 05:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
basically using Biometrics technology
 
05:52:27.510 --> 05:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
that can see who the driver is through
 
05:52:30.070 --> 05:52:30.080 align:start position:0%
the vehicle uh that would be a pretty
 
05:52:32.070 --> 05:52:32.080 align:start position:0%
significant change of any other traffic
 
05:52:33.788 --> 05:52:33.798 align:start position:0%
use at tolls or other areas that would
 
05:52:37.310 --> 05:52:37.320 align:start position:0%
get into privacy issues um we also heard
 
05:52:38.910 --> 05:52:38.920 align:start position:0%
that this was to be at no expense to the
 
05:52:41.190 --> 05:52:41.200 align:start position:0%
state but that there were townships that
 
05:52:42.750 --> 05:52:42.760 align:start position:0%
are complaining about their tax rate
 
05:52:44.468 --> 05:52:44.478 align:start position:0%
that could implement it and this is not
 
05:52:46.030 --> 05:52:46.040 align:start position:0%
going to be an inexpensive program
 
05:52:48.110 --> 05:52:48.120 align:start position:0%
especially since thirdparty vendors are
 
05:52:49.468 --> 05:52:49.478 align:start position:0%
not allowed but when you do put in a
 
05:52:50.990 --> 05:52:51.000 align:start position:0%
third party vendor now you have more of
 
05:52:53.468 --> 05:52:53.478 align:start position:0%
a privacy concern the way it's written
 
05:52:56.548 --> 05:52:56.558 align:start position:0%
is just not smart legislation and it it
 
05:52:58.230 --> 05:52:58.240 align:start position:0%
runs that borderline of diving into
 
05:52:58.240 --> 05:53:00.110 align:start position:0%

Hamlin Mr chair I'd like to make a

thank you sir is there a second seconded
 
05:54:57.030 --> 05:54:57.040 align:start position:0%
by representative Miller care to speak
 
05:55:02.150 --> 05:55:02.160 align:start position:0%
to your motion sir thank you uh so when
 
05:55:04.548 --> 05:55:04.558 align:start position:0%
when fire apparatus as we commonly call
 
05:55:06.670 --> 05:55:06.680 align:start position:0%
fire trucks uh reach their end end of
 
05:55:10.150 --> 05:55:10.160 align:start position:0%
life typically 20 years plus uh at that
 
05:55:12.670 --> 05:55:12.680 align:start position:0%
point they can be retired by a town or a
 
05:55:15.670 --> 05:55:15.680 align:start position:0%
city uh however these trucks are still
 
05:55:20.708 --> 05:55:20.718 align:start position:0%
in good condition uh there is a growing
 
05:55:24.468 --> 05:55:24.478 align:start position:0%
um ground swth not a ground SW but uh
 
05:55:27.070 --> 05:55:27.080 align:start position:0%
interest out there of people using these
 
05:55:29.548 --> 05:55:29.558 align:start position:0%
trucks as Collectibles something that
 
05:55:31.628 --> 05:55:31.638 align:start position:0%
they can put in a collection something
 
05:55:33.468 --> 05:55:33.478 align:start position:0%
they can use and they like to be able to
 
05:55:37.190 --> 05:55:37.200 align:start position:0%
use these trucks in parades and
 
05:55:40.190 --> 05:55:40.200 align:start position:0%
and if if they know that they can buy
 
05:55:41.990 --> 05:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
one of these trucks in the original
 
05:55:44.590 --> 05:55:44.600 align:start position:0%
condition and use it for nothing say
 
05:55:46.990 --> 05:55:47.000 align:start position:0%
parade but a show there'll be more
 
05:55:49.390 --> 05:55:49.400 align:start position:0%
interest in this being able to buy one
 
05:55:52.310 --> 05:55:52.320 align:start position:0%
of these from a town and a town can have
 
05:55:55.590 --> 05:55:55.600 align:start position:0%
a means of being able to uh retire this
 
05:55:57.190 --> 05:55:57.200 align:start position:0%
truck knowing that it's going to go to a
 
05:55:59.190 --> 05:55:59.200 align:start position:0%
good cause thank
 
05:56:02.350 --> 05:56:02.360 align:start position:0%
you thank you anybody else from the
 
05:56:04.510 --> 05:56:04.520 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
05:56:07.430 --> 05:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
be thank you Mr chairman um one of my
 
05:56:08.468 --> 05:56:08.478 align:start position:0%
favorite things in a parade is seeing
 
05:56:10.910 --> 05:56:10.920 align:start position:0%
the old fire trucks and I think this
 
05:56:13.390 --> 05:56:13.400 align:start position:0%
helps people give incentive for people
 
05:56:15.390 --> 05:56:15.400 align:start position:0%
to preserve them regardless of how old
 
05:56:18.628 --> 05:56:18.638 align:start position:0%
they are so U I totally support this
 
05:56:21.150 --> 05:56:21.160 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you anybody else represent
 
05:56:24.548 --> 05:56:24.558 align:start position:0%
SES yeah one one other aspect to this is
 
05:56:27.750 --> 05:56:27.760 align:start position:0%
actually will make a more vibrant
 
05:56:29.910 --> 05:56:29.920 align:start position:0%
Marketplace for used fire apparatus
 
05:56:33.110 --> 05:56:33.120 align:start position:0%
which will help the taxpayers because um
 
05:56:34.670 --> 05:56:34.680 align:start position:0%
at least in my day when I was in the
 
05:56:36.990 --> 05:56:37.000 align:start position:0%
fire department we you couldn't you
 
05:56:38.750 --> 05:56:38.760 align:start position:0%
couldn't give away all fire trucks
 
05:56:40.750 --> 05:56:40.760 align:start position:0%
nobody wanted them because there was no
 
05:56:43.708 --> 05:56:43.718 align:start position:0%
there was just no money in it uh this is
 
05:56:46.270 --> 05:56:46.280 align:start position:0%
a good thing for that reason
 
05:56:50.150 --> 05:56:50.160 align:start position:0%
too anybody else seeing none I'll ask
 
05:56:51.390 --> 05:56:51.400 align:start position:0%

care to speak to your motion
 
05:59:16.310 --> 05:59:16.320 align:start position:0%
sir uh just real briefly
 
05:59:20.750 --> 05:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
um this this bill really isn't needed um
 
05:59:23.590 --> 05:59:23.600 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what it's trying to address
 
05:59:26.030 --> 05:59:26.040 align:start position:0%
specifically but
 
05:59:30.070 --> 05:59:30.080 align:start position:0%
um yeah it's just not needed
 
05:59:32.510 --> 05:59:32.520 align:start position:0%
now thank you anybody else from
 
05:59:35.270 --> 05:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
represented pondon thank you Mr chair I
 
05:59:38.310 --> 05:59:38.320 align:start position:0%
won't be supporting supping itl um the
 
05:59:40.510 --> 05:59:40.520 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors of this legislation it's
 
05:59:43.310 --> 05:59:43.320 align:start position:0%
it's it's definitely an intended safety
 
05:59:45.390 --> 05:59:45.400 align:start position:0%
issue during inclement weather we've
 
05:59:47.270 --> 05:59:47.280 align:start position:0%
heard comments about clearing bugs off
 
05:59:50.310 --> 05:59:50.320 align:start position:0%
the windshield it it's not about that um
 
05:59:53.070 --> 05:59:53.080 align:start position:0%
some of the statistics statistics I have
 
05:59:56.990 --> 05:59:57.000 align:start position:0%
between 1998 2007 seven states enacted
 
06:00:01.548 --> 06:00:01.558 align:start position:0%
the same legislation and the multiple
 
06:00:03.468 --> 06:00:03.478 align:start position:0%
not single vehicle accidents but multi
 
06:00:06.628 --> 06:00:06.638 align:start position:0%
vehicle accidents during the daytime
 
06:00:09.390 --> 06:00:09.400 align:start position:0%
plummeted substantially in those seven
 
06:00:13.190 --> 06:00:13.200 align:start position:0%
states so it's strictly a safety issue
 
06:00:16.310 --> 06:00:16.320 align:start position:0%
uh it's mainly for older vehicles as you
 
06:00:18.310 --> 06:00:18.320 align:start position:0%
know newer Vehicles now the headlights
 
06:00:20.948 --> 06:00:20.958 align:start position:0%
automatically come on um but again it's
 
06:00:22.468 --> 06:00:22.478 align:start position:0%
just a safety issue and that's the
 
06:00:24.548 --> 06:00:24.558 align:start position:0%
intention behind this legislation so I
 
06:00:27.830 --> 06:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
can't support the itail motion thank you
 
06:00:30.830 --> 06:00:30.840 align:start position:0%
anybody else representative gon thank
 
06:00:32.788 --> 06:00:32.798 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair my biggest concern with
 
06:00:35.350 --> 06:00:35.360 align:start position:0%
this law was that or with this bill is
 
06:00:37.030 --> 06:00:37.040 align:start position:0%
that it didn't address the most
 
06:00:38.468 --> 06:00:38.478 align:start position:0%
important lights on a vehicle when your
 
06:00:40.310 --> 06:00:40.320 align:start position:0%
windshield wipers are on and that's your
 
06:00:41.788 --> 06:00:41.798 align:start position:0%
your tail lights because you're you're
 
06:00:44.150 --> 06:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
kicking up spray in inclement weather
 
06:00:47.190 --> 06:00:47.200 align:start position:0%
and the intention was visibility within
 
06:00:50.030 --> 06:00:50.040 align:start position:0%
1,000 ft but you don't have rear side
 
06:00:51.628 --> 06:00:51.638 align:start position:0%
visibility without the tail lights on
 
06:00:53.390 --> 06:00:53.400 align:start position:0%
and that was never in any way addressed
 
06:00:56.030 --> 06:00:56.040 align:start position:0%
in this bill um in addition to that the
 
06:00:58.948 --> 06:00:58.958 align:start position:0%
verbiage didn't seem to make it these
 
06:01:01.468 --> 06:01:01.478 align:start position:0%
conditions or windshield wipers on due
 
06:01:02.788 --> 06:01:02.798 align:start position:0%
to inclement whether it was these
 
06:01:04.590 --> 06:01:04.600 align:start position:0%
conditions and windshield wipers on
 
06:01:06.310 --> 06:01:06.320 align:start position:0%
which could actually have a an adverse
 
06:01:08.150 --> 06:01:08.160 align:start position:0%
effect on the way the law is interpreted
 
06:01:08.160 --> 06:01:09.110 align:start position:0%
effect on the way the law is interpreted
and

06:01:09.110 --> 06:01:09.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:01:12.030 --> 06:01:12.040 align:start position:0%
exercised thank you sir anybody else
 
06:01:14.548 --> 06:01:14.558 align:start position:0%
repr repres St Clair thank you Mr chair
 
06:01:17.070 --> 06:01:17.080 align:start position:0%
maybe somebody can answer this um is
 
06:01:18.390 --> 06:01:18.400 align:start position:0%
there a law that says you have to use
 
06:01:22.868 --> 06:01:22.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:25.670 --> 06:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
raining that's a very good point with
 
06:01:27.390 --> 06:01:27.400 align:start position:0%
the Advent of rainex there's a lot of
 
06:01:29.548 --> 06:01:29.558 align:start position:0%
people that probably don't because that
 
06:01:33.390 --> 06:01:33.400 align:start position:0%
stuff does work well good point Thank
 
06:01:36.830 --> 06:01:36.840 align:start position:0%
you anybody else representative a
 
06:01:38.110 --> 06:01:38.120 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I appreci
 
06:01:39.708 --> 06:01:39.718 align:start position:0%
appreciate about this bill is the
 
06:01:43.110 --> 06:01:43.120 align:start position:0%
definition of needing your your lights
 
06:01:45.310 --> 06:01:45.320 align:start position:0%
on when visibility is below a th000 feet
 
06:01:46.990 --> 06:01:47.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of us especially in in Clement
 
06:01:48.150 --> 06:01:48.160 align:start position:0%
weather weather would probably have a
 
06:01:50.468 --> 06:01:50.478 align:start position:0%
hard time judging what 1,000 feet is
 
06:01:51.910 --> 06:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
this changes that to when you're
 
06:01:53.670 --> 06:01:53.680 align:start position:0%
headlight when your wipers are on which
 
06:01:56.750 --> 06:01:56.760 align:start position:0%
is a clear definition uh most of us are
 
06:01:59.150 --> 06:01:59.160 align:start position:0%
going to use our wipers uh whether we
 
06:02:01.868 --> 06:02:01.878 align:start position:0%
have rainx on there or not but uh so
 
06:02:03.948 --> 06:02:03.958 align:start position:0%
that's that's why I'll support the
 
06:02:06.948 --> 06:02:06.958 align:start position:0%
bill anybody else
 
06:02:09.628 --> 06:02:09.638 align:start position:0%
I'll just say this oh go ahead represent
 
06:02:12.430 --> 06:02:12.440 align:start position:0%
hlin uh there was one thing that was
 
06:02:14.310 --> 06:02:14.320 align:start position:0%
left out of the bill in my opinion and
 
06:02:17.110 --> 06:02:17.120 align:start position:0%
that was using the delay function on
 
06:02:19.830 --> 06:02:19.840 align:start position:0%
your vehicle you don't always need your
 
06:02:22.468 --> 06:02:22.478 align:start position:0%
windi wipers working at full speed when
 
06:02:25.190 --> 06:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
it's raining out um but this bill does
 
06:02:27.230 --> 06:02:27.240 align:start position:0%
not address as to whether or not it's
 
06:02:30.788 --> 06:02:30.798 align:start position:0%
okay to use delay at the slowest speed
 
06:02:30.798 --> 06:02:32.270 align:start position:0%
okay to use delay at the slowest speed
thank

06:02:32.270 --> 06:02:32.280 align:start position:0%
thank
 
06:02:36.430 --> 06:02:36.440 align:start position:0%
you anybody else seeing none and and I I
 
06:02:39.468 --> 06:02:39.478 align:start position:0%
I where I'm at on it I agree with you
 
06:02:41.310 --> 06:02:41.320 align:start position:0%
maybe perhaps representative plon this
 
06:02:42.868 --> 06:02:42.878 align:start position:0%
has changed some statistics and the
 
06:02:45.150 --> 06:02:45.160 align:start position:0%
states have adopted it but I look at it
 
06:02:47.868 --> 06:02:47.878 align:start position:0%
this way it's just another thing you can
 
06:02:50.430 --> 06:02:50.440 align:start position:0%
get pulled over for another violation
 
06:02:52.830 --> 06:02:52.840 align:start position:0%
another thing for police to do there's a
 
06:02:54.310 --> 06:02:54.320 align:start position:0%
lot of things that we can do for
 
06:02:56.468 --> 06:02:56.478 align:start position:0%
safety's purposes that don't require
 
06:02:58.628 --> 06:02:58.638 align:start position:0%
legislation we have those electronic
 
06:03:00.510 --> 06:03:00.520 align:start position:0%
Billboards all over our highway system
 
06:03:02.350 --> 06:03:02.360 align:start position:0%
now this could be addressed very easily
 
06:03:04.948 --> 06:03:04.958 align:start position:0%
with education repeated education
 
06:03:06.628 --> 06:03:06.638 align:start position:0%
repeated message from the Department of
 
06:03:09.948 --> 06:03:09.958 align:start position:0%
Transportation hey it's a good idea to
 
06:03:12.030 --> 06:03:12.040 align:start position:0%
um use your windshield wipers or your
 
06:03:13.910 --> 06:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
lights when the windshield wipers are on
 
06:03:15.310 --> 06:03:15.320 align:start position:0%
I just don't see this rising to the
 
06:03:17.910 --> 06:03:17.920 align:start position:0%
level of requiring another law and
 
06:03:21.230 --> 06:03:21.240 align:start position:0%
another reason for citation so I'll be
 
06:03:24.430 --> 06:03:24.440 align:start position:0%
supporting the itl myself with nobody
 
06:03:26.548 --> 06:03:26.558 align:start position:0%
else I will ask the clerk to call the
 
06:03:28.390 --> 06:03:28.400 align:start position:0%
role when she's ready the motion is
 
06:03:31.390 --> 06:03:31.400 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate those Bill
 
06:03:35.270 --> 06:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
