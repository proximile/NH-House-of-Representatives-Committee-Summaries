00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
one nation under God indivisible with
 
00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:08.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:13.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:17.210 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:17.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
I hope you all had a chance to read the
 
00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:23.160 align:start position:0%
write-up that the Secretary of State's
 
00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
office gave us last week
 
00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:28.980 align:start position:0%
I actually found it pretty interesting
 
00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:30.650 align:start position:0%
I actually found it pretty interesting
and

00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:30.660 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:32.210 align:start position:0%
and
it

00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:32.220 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:35.640 align:start position:0%
kind of put my my thoughts I'm starting
 
00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:38.180 align:start position:0%
to get a feeling of what maybe we could
 
00:09:41.449 --> 00:09:41.459 align:start position:0%
accomplish here you know something
 
00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:43.200 align:start position:0%
I like to find the areas of agreement
 
00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
when I'm working with people you know
 
00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:47.160 align:start position:0%
focus on that first because
 
00:09:48.949 --> 00:09:48.959 align:start position:0%
the areas of disagreement will always
 
00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:51.060 align:start position:0%
take care of themselves right
 
00:09:53.449 --> 00:09:53.459 align:start position:0%
but uh when I was looking at this
 
00:09:53.459 --> 00:09:55.009 align:start position:0%
but uh when I was looking at this
write-up

00:09:55.009 --> 00:09:55.019 align:start position:0%
write-up
 
00:09:57.829 --> 00:09:57.839 align:start position:0%
it it made me start to think that in
 
00:09:59.870 --> 00:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
addition to policy matters in which we
 
00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:01.560 align:start position:0%
expect some disagreement though some
 
00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:03.720 align:start position:0%
agreement as well it seems like there's
 
00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:04.490 align:start position:0%
agreement as well it seems like there's
a

00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:04.500 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:09.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:10.980 align:start position:0%
I don't want to say issues a lot of
 
00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:12.620 align:start position:0%
aspects of the current
 
00:10:15.889 --> 00:10:15.899 align:start position:0%
statutes that ought to be we could all
 
00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:18.180 align:start position:0%
be able to agree need to be fixed
 
00:10:20.509 --> 00:10:20.519 align:start position:0%
and so it should be easy to become seems
 
00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
to me should be relatively easy to come
 
00:10:24.769 --> 00:10:24.779 align:start position:0%
to an agreement on some simple stuff
 
00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:27.300 align:start position:0%
like like the question that he brought
 
00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:28.920 align:start position:0%
up about
 
00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:30.600 align:start position:0%
the difference between
 
00:10:33.949 --> 00:10:33.959 align:start position:0%
candidates filing as a candidate and
 
00:10:35.389 --> 00:10:35.399 align:start position:0%
filing as a candidate committee you
 
00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:36.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned that in the notes that you
 
00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:37.740 align:start position:0%
sent me too
 
00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:39.590 align:start position:0%
sent me too
uh

00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:42.660 align:start position:0%
where they have different uh reporting
 
00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:45.060 align:start position:0%
deadlines in a couple of instances
 
00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:46.500 align:start position:0%
I mean it seems to me that should be
 
00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:48.420 align:start position:0%
something it should be
 
00:10:50.389 --> 00:10:50.399 align:start position:0%
relatively straightforward to bring into
 
00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:52.860 align:start position:0%
agreement between a candidate committee
 
00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:54.540 align:start position:0%
and someone running just as a candidate
 
00:10:57.530 --> 00:10:57.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:59.509 --> 00:10:59.519 align:start position:0%
I asked that because when I'm speaking
 
00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:03.180 align:start position:0%
it always makes sense to me so I want to
 
00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:06.500 align:start position:0%
yeah so go ahead do we require
 
00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:09.060 align:start position:0%
candidates to have a candidate committee
 
00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:16.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
before so I guess my question is do we
 
00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:22.740 align:start position:0%
as a group want to require candidates to
 
00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:25.860 align:start position:0%
file as a committee or still give them
 
00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:29.060 align:start position:0%
the chance to file only as a candidate
 
00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:31.800 align:start position:0%
and I don't understand the advantage of
 
00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:34.140 align:start position:0%
the disadvantage either way but I was I
 
00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:35.880 align:start position:0%
was thinking about that you might
 
00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
remember that last year or the year
 
00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
before this there was a proposal to
 
00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:41.870 align:start position:0%
before this there was a proposal to
require

00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:41.880 align:start position:0%
require
 
00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
all candidates including State Rep
 
00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:47.640 align:start position:0%
candidates to form a committee and
 
00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
at that time and I haven't changed my
 
00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:52.260 align:start position:0%
mind I really don't think we should try
 
00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
to fit everyone into that box because a
 
00:11:57.470 --> 00:11:57.480 align:start position:0%
lot of you know we've got 400 State reps
 
00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:58.610 align:start position:0%
lot of you know we've got 400 State reps
uh

00:11:58.610 --> 00:11:58.620 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
and a lot of our campaigns are pretty
 
00:12:03.949 --> 00:12:03.959 align:start position:0%
simple to run and don't really require
 
00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
more than one person who who can accept
 
00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:09.660 align:start position:0%
financial responsibility you know fiscal
 
00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:11.269 align:start position:0%
financial responsibility you know fiscal
responsibility

00:12:11.269 --> 00:12:11.279 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
00:12:11.279 --> 00:12:12.769 align:start position:0%
responsibility
uh

00:12:12.769 --> 00:12:12.779 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
so my feeling is no we don't need to
 
00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:16.850 align:start position:0%
so my feeling is no we don't need to
require

00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:16.860 align:start position:0%
require
 
00:12:18.769 --> 00:12:18.779 align:start position:0%
a candidate committee certainly not the
 
00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:21.180 align:start position:0%
State Rep level but
 
00:12:23.449 --> 00:12:23.459 align:start position:0%
I was thinking as I was
 
00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
as I was reading this these notes from
 
00:12:27.829 --> 00:12:27.839 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state that
 
00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
well I still think if a campaign is on a
 
00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:34.440 align:start position:0%
large enough scale maybe if state senate
 
00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:37.260 align:start position:0%
race qualifies for that by large scale I
 
00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:38.760 align:start position:0%
I mean really
 
00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:40.500 align:start position:0%
substantial large amounts of money
 
00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:42.060 align:start position:0%
amounts of money would all agree are
 
00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
substantial I mean I I understand that
 
00:12:47.090 --> 00:12:47.100 align:start position:0%
some State Senate races can run what a
 
00:12:48.949 --> 00:12:48.959 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand or a lot more I mean to
 
00:12:50.449 --> 00:12:50.459 align:start position:0%
me that's real money
 
00:12:53.449 --> 00:12:53.459 align:start position:0%
as well to me a quarter is a real real
 
00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
money but but you know that's that's
 
00:12:57.350 --> 00:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
serious money where
 
00:12:59.269 --> 00:12:59.279 align:start position:0%
as a candidate especially running for
 
00:13:02.449 --> 00:13:02.459 align:start position:0%
the first time you might want some
 
00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:06.300 align:start position:0%
some people helping you officially that
 
00:13:08.389 --> 00:13:08.399 align:start position:0%
uh familiar with the ins and outs of
 
00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:10.440 align:start position:0%
running such a campaign so I think we
 
00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:12.660 align:start position:0%
should still allow the opportunity
 
00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:14.940 align:start position:0%
so I think
 
00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:16.740 align:start position:0%
being able to run as solely as a
 
00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:18.420 align:start position:0%
candidate or having a candidate
 
00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
committee still make sense to me
 
00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:24.300 align:start position:0%
but bringing just picking on one issue
 
00:13:26.569 --> 00:13:26.579 align:start position:0%
is an exam as an example of something I
 
00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
think we should be able to agree on
 
00:13:31.009 --> 00:13:31.019 align:start position:0%
having those reporting deadlines the
 
00:13:31.019 --> 00:13:32.150 align:start position:0%
having those reporting deadlines the
same

00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:32.160 align:start position:0%
same
 
00:13:35.269 --> 00:13:35.279 align:start position:0%
uh I think it's the
 
00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
the two deadlines
 
00:13:41.569 --> 00:13:41.579 align:start position:0%
in the uh off here the odd numbered year
 
00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:43.980 align:start position:0%
where the candidate committees have to
 
00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:45.350 align:start position:0%
where the candidate committees have to
report

00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
report
 
00:13:49.009 --> 00:13:49.019 align:start position:0%
file a report in June and December
 
00:13:51.490 --> 00:13:51.500 align:start position:0%
and someone running who's
 
00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
still filed is registered as just a
 
00:13:56.690 --> 00:13:56.700 align:start position:0%
candidate does it in May and November
 
00:13:58.730 --> 00:13:58.740 align:start position:0%
why shouldn't those be the same
 
00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:00.720 align:start position:0%
I can't think of a good reason
 
00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:04.440 align:start position:0%
is it that's something that
 
00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:09.300 align:start position:0%
I think would help reduce uh
 
00:14:11.389 --> 00:14:11.399 align:start position:0%
confusion basically on the part of the
 
00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:14.100 align:start position:0%
the candidates and the people working
 
00:14:15.949 --> 00:14:15.959 align:start position:0%
with them
 
00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:17.820 align:start position:0%
so that's that's there's one example of
 
00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:19.320 align:start position:0%
something I think we should be able to
 
00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
agree on there's a number of others here
 
00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:22.370 align:start position:0%
agree on there's a number of others here
too

00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:22.380 align:start position:0%
too
 
00:14:24.889 --> 00:14:24.899 align:start position:0%
so I'm
 
00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:27.240 align:start position:0%
are you saying that the only times they
 
00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:30.120 align:start position:0%
would been a file would be uh May and
 
00:14:32.329 --> 00:14:32.339 align:start position:0%
December no I was I was looking at the
 
00:14:35.569 --> 00:14:35.579 align:start position:0%
table in this write-up of the filing uh
 
00:14:37.850 --> 00:14:37.860 align:start position:0%
deadlines and it looked like there were
 
00:14:39.769 --> 00:14:39.779 align:start position:0%
only two that were different between
 
00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:44.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:47.629 --> 00:14:47.639 align:start position:0%
uh it's on they're on page seven and
 
00:14:47.639 --> 00:14:49.730 align:start position:0%
uh it's on they're on page seven and
eight

00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:49.740 align:start position:0%
eight
 
00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:52.980 align:start position:0%
there of this this write-up that they
 
00:14:56.269 --> 00:14:56.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:56.279 --> 00:14:59.210 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:14:59.210 --> 00:14:59.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:03.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:05.269 --> 00:15:05.279 align:start position:0%
let's see uh
 
00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:06.720 align:start position:0%
it looks like there's three actually
 
00:15:09.949 --> 00:15:09.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:12.120 align:start position:0%
too late to do anything but a June
 
00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:14.100 align:start position:0%
filing deadline for the candidate
 
00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
committees that does not apply to the
 
00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:17.940 align:start position:0%
candidates at the top of page seven
 
00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:19.800 align:start position:0%
so again there's lots more to discuss
 
00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:21.410 align:start position:0%
so again there's lots more to discuss
but

00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:21.420 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:22.850 align:start position:0%
but
this

00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:22.860 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
is establishing the idea that we can
 
00:15:27.829 --> 00:15:27.839 align:start position:0%
find things we can all agree on
 
00:15:27.839 --> 00:15:29.170 align:start position:0%
find things we can all agree on
and

00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:29.180 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:31.860 align:start position:0%
my thinking is that that would probably
 
00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:34.380 align:start position:0%
be a really good place to start
 
00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:36.400 align:start position:0%
maybe we'll get in the habit of agreeing
 
00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:38.990 align:start position:0%
maybe we'll get in the habit of agreeing
[Laughter]

00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:39.000 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
so those are my thoughts right now the
 
00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:43.320 align:start position:0%
the thoughts that from the front of my
 
00:15:53.569 --> 00:15:53.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:55.320 align:start position:0%
I mean I didn't have a strong opinion
 
00:15:58.189 --> 00:15:58.199 align:start position:0%
either way I never really understood the
 
00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:00.060 align:start position:0%
difference you know why you would do it
 
00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
I just felt like for my own race I mean
 
00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
it was so small it didn't make sense to
 
00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:07.740 align:start position:0%
do a committee and I wasn't going to
 
00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:09.540 align:start position:0%
raise a ton of money that kind of thing
 
00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:13.500 align:start position:0%
but so I didn't do it but if if you're
 
00:16:16.189 --> 00:16:16.199 align:start position:0%
running for Senate or executive Council
 
00:16:19.129 --> 00:16:19.139 align:start position:0%
Governor I mean you need somebody to do
 
00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:21.240 align:start position:0%
that I agree with that I just didn't
 
00:16:23.269 --> 00:16:23.279 align:start position:0%
know we we're trying to streamline
 
00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:25.320 align:start position:0%
things would did we want everybody to be
 
00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:26.940 align:start position:0%
a committee but as long as we're making
 
00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:28.860 align:start position:0%
them report I don't see that it makes
 
00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
that much difference I can be convinced
 
00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:33.300 align:start position:0%
otherwise but
 
00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:43.430 align:start position:0%
otherwise but
foreign

00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:46.329 --> 00:16:46.339 align:start position:0%
just like to review the argument for
 
00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:49.320 align:start position:0%
simplifying by having everybody register
 
00:16:51.769 --> 00:16:51.779 align:start position:0%
as a candidate committee versus the
 
00:16:53.810 --> 00:16:53.820 align:start position:0%
present form which you said you you
 
00:16:56.329 --> 00:16:56.339 align:start position:0%
prefer where candidates have the option
 
00:16:59.150 --> 00:16:59.160 align:start position:0%
of being just a candidate and not having
 
00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:01.500 align:start position:0%
a candidate committee so there was that
 
00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
bill you mentioned earlier that would
 
00:17:05.329 --> 00:17:05.339 align:start position:0%
make everybody register as a candidate
 
00:17:07.549 --> 00:17:07.559 align:start position:0%
committee right and what's the argument
 
00:17:10.309 --> 00:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
for that what's the argument against it
 
00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
I actually don't remember the argument
 
00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:14.640 align:start position:0%
for except maybe a simplification one
 
00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
but I don't think it's that complicated
 
00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:19.500 align:start position:0%
the way we're doing it now the argument
 
00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:21.720 align:start position:0%
against it from my own personal
 
00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:25.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:28.500 align:start position:0%
a campaign that's
 
00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
State Rep a campaign does not have to be
 
00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:33.240 align:start position:0%
terribly complicated
 
00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:35.400 align:start position:0%
you put out signs maybe you put a few
 
00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:37.980 align:start position:0%
ads in you your door knock we all know
 
00:17:39.409 --> 00:17:39.419 align:start position:0%
the routine
 
00:17:43.909 --> 00:17:43.919 align:start position:0%
and to to be required to find somebody
 
00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:46.440 align:start position:0%
else who will officially sign up and
 
00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
participate in that campaign is just
 
00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
it's just it's almost like another
 
00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:54.240 align:start position:0%
barrier to participation
 
00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:00.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:03.480 align:start position:0%
for the reports uh yeah I can't see any
 
00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:11.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:12.890 align:start position:0%
 
right

00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:12.900 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:14.590 align:start position:0%
right
and

00:18:14.590 --> 00:18:14.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:17.460 align:start position:0%
confusion and the discussion we had last
 
00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:19.020 align:start position:0%
week with the
 
00:18:21.529 --> 00:18:21.539 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State and
 
00:18:25.549 --> 00:18:25.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
they seem to think that would make sense
 
00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:29.220 align:start position:0%
also they couldn't they didn't they were
 
00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
bringing this to our attention as
 
00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:33.480 align:start position:0%
something that could be improved I think
 
00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:35.640 align:start position:0%
again this is just one example as I was
 
00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:38.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:40.669 --> 00:18:40.679 align:start position:0%
and I'm really I was really happy they
 
00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:42.740 align:start position:0%
gave us a handout because trying to take
 
00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:45.480 align:start position:0%
adequate notes while listening it can be
 
00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:49.490 align:start position:0%
adequate notes while listening it can be
difficult

00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:49.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:52.669 --> 00:18:52.679 align:start position:0%
so how would you guys like to hand oh uh
 
00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
were you here a few minutes ago when I
 
00:18:55.669 --> 00:18:55.679 align:start position:0%
was since yeah yeah when I was
 
00:18:57.169 --> 00:18:57.179 align:start position:0%
suggesting that we hold the next meeting
 
00:18:58.909 --> 00:18:58.919 align:start position:0%
two weeks from today
 
00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:00.840 align:start position:0%
yeah okay
 
00:19:03.049 --> 00:19:03.059 align:start position:0%
I have another question or point about
 
00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:05.160 align:start position:0%
candidate candidate committee please on
 
00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
page six of the um handout from the
 
00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:11.100 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office last week
 
00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:15.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:17.640 align:start position:0%
right oh excuse me just under number
 
00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
three reporting deadlines because I
 
00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:21.660 align:start position:0%
guess what we're talking about
 
00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:22.549 align:start position:0%
guess what we're talking about
um

00:19:22.549 --> 00:19:22.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:24.409 --> 00:19:24.419 align:start position:0%
the end of the first paragraph says this
 
00:19:24.419 --> 00:19:26.210 align:start position:0%
the end of the first paragraph says this
distinction

00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:26.220 align:start position:0%
distinction
 
00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:28.440 align:start position:0%
on when the first report is due is
 
00:19:30.529 --> 00:19:30.539 align:start position:0%
another area where 664 is complex
 
00:19:32.810 --> 00:19:32.820 align:start position:0%
requires deep understandable is that
 
00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:33.960 align:start position:0%
what we're addressing right now or is
 
00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
this a different issue that that's
 
00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:41.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:44.110 --> 00:19:44.120 align:start position:0%
we're we're
 
00:19:48.169 --> 00:19:48.179 align:start position:0%
addressing I think of a specific aspect
 
00:19:51.289 --> 00:19:51.299 align:start position:0%
of the general issue of complexity
 
00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
when it comes to political committees
 
00:19:58.010 --> 00:19:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:00.240 align:start position:0%
right now yes in one particular aspect
 
00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:02.220 align:start position:0%
of that there's other aspects that we
 
00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:04.620 align:start position:0%
could look at as well again I was just
 
00:20:06.049 --> 00:20:06.059 align:start position:0%
trying to come up with an example of
 
00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
establish the point that we can agree on
 
00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:09.730 align:start position:0%
establish the point that we can agree on
things

00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:09.740 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:33.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:35.820 align:start position:0%
I have the same recording requirements
 
00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:39.190 align:start position:0%
I have the same recording requirements
right

00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:40.850 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:40.860 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:43.919 align:start position:0%
based on my reading and my Recollections
 
00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:45.660 align:start position:0%
of last week's meeting there's a a
 
00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:48.660 align:start position:0%
number of things like this that would
 
00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:52.010 align:start position:0%
number of things like this that would
uh

00:20:52.010 --> 00:20:52.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:53.160 align:start position:0%
you know we could there are
 
00:20:55.610 --> 00:20:55.620 align:start position:0%
contradictions in the statutes as
 
00:20:57.830 --> 00:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
currently written that I think we could
 
00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:04.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:06.529 --> 00:21:06.539 align:start position:0%
we were we were listening to The Experts
 
00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
last week and
 
00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:09.720 align:start position:0%
it was
 
00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State's office it was
 
00:21:13.789 --> 00:21:13.799 align:start position:0%
clear they were aspects of the statutes
 
00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:15.480 align:start position:0%
that they're not quite sure what they
 
00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:16.610 align:start position:0%
that they're not quite sure what they
mean

00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:16.620 align:start position:0%
mean
 
00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:19.500 align:start position:0%
which is not a good thing
 
00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
see in my mind right now I'm splitting
 
00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
the subject matter into like two broad
 
00:21:25.549 --> 00:21:25.559 align:start position:0%
areas one
 
00:21:28.250 --> 00:21:28.260 align:start position:0%
is of course the policy questions you
 
00:21:30.529 --> 00:21:30.539 align:start position:0%
know thresholds for reporting and so on
 
00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
that that's a policy matter
 
00:21:36.529 --> 00:21:36.539 align:start position:0%
but whatever policies we
 
00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:38.460 align:start position:0%
agree on
 
00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:40.380 align:start position:0%
uh there's a separate issue which is
 
00:21:42.409 --> 00:21:42.419 align:start position:0%
whatever is in the statute should be
 
00:21:42.419 --> 00:21:45.770 align:start position:0%
whatever is in the statute should be
understandable

00:21:45.770 --> 00:21:45.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:47.029 align:start position:0%
 
right

00:21:47.029 --> 00:21:47.039 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:48.720 align:start position:0%
oh that's right you're you're in that
 
00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
professions I'm sure you see many
 
00:21:53.149 --> 00:21:53.159 align:start position:0%
examples in yeah where things are not
 
00:21:53.159 --> 00:21:57.230 align:start position:0%
examples in yeah where things are not
clear

00:21:57.230 --> 00:21:57.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:59.870 --> 00:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
okay so can I take Advan Advantage
 
00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:02.029 align:start position:0%
okay so can I take Advan Advantage
having

00:22:02.029 --> 00:22:02.039 align:start position:0%
having
 
00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:03.480 align:start position:0%
State here
 
00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
for a minute yes you can if she's
 
00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:09.240 align:start position:0%
willing to discuss things with us yeah I
 
00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:11.640 align:start position:0%
guess you do have to but this we're
 
00:22:14.149 --> 00:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
trying to let me let me introduce her
 
00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:16.380 align:start position:0%
okay deputy secretary of state Aaron
 
00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:19.310 align:start position:0%
okay deputy secretary of state Aaron
Hennessy

00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:21.169 --> 00:22:21.179 align:start position:0%
thank you for joining us
 
00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:26.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:28.500 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office to come
 
00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
and address us on issues with no success
 
00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
so we'd like to enlist someone's help if
 
00:22:38.149 --> 00:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
we if that makes sense and if you're if
 
00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:40.380 align:start position:0%
they're comfortable doing it and helping
 
00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:42.720 align:start position:0%
us reach out to the AG and have them
 
00:22:45.049 --> 00:22:45.059 align:start position:0%
come and do a presentation the way last
 
00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:47.340 align:start position:0%
week that Secretary of State and
 
00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
um Mr Finch pitched in so
 
00:22:52.549 --> 00:22:52.559 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to reach out to their office
 
00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:55.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:22:57.950 --> 00:22:57.960 align:start position:0%
well thank you
 
00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
well we we had a very good discussion
 
00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:02.460 align:start position:0%
with uh
 
00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
Mr Scanlon and Mr Stitch last week
 
00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
and we but we we know that uh
 
00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
we need to talk to the people
 
00:23:13.730 --> 00:23:13.740 align:start position:0%
responsible for enforcing
 
00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
the campaign Finance system laws
 
00:23:19.850 --> 00:23:19.860 align:start position:0%
back we were I think reminded of that
 
00:23:22.909 --> 00:23:22.919 align:start position:0%
several times in that discussion
 
00:23:24.529 --> 00:23:24.539 align:start position:0%
so thank you any help would be
 
00:23:24.539 --> 00:23:29.830 align:start position:0%
so thank you any help would be
appreciated

00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:47.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:51.049 --> 00:23:51.059 align:start position:0%
well you you did send the did you want
 
00:23:54.529 --> 00:23:54.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:58.070 --> 00:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
yeah okay sure if you'd like to share it
 
00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:01.070 align:start position:0%
yeah okay sure if you'd like to share it
sure

00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:04.620 align:start position:0%
uh representative Lane prepared a list
 
00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:05.510 align:start position:0%
uh representative Lane prepared a list
of

00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:08.100 align:start position:0%
the things that caught her eye and
 
00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:10.260 align:start position:0%
and reading the Secretary of State's
 
00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:12.890 align:start position:0%
and reading the Secretary of State's
write-up

00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:12.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
it was not quite as organized I made my
 
00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:27.900 align:start position:0%
was there anything uh
 
00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
representative Muirhead that you've had
 
00:24:34.669 --> 00:24:34.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
or approach you'd like to take
 
00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
why I agree with your approach and uh
 
00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:45.890 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:45.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:49.080 align:start position:0%
I do think it'd be good to have a list
 
00:24:51.529 --> 00:24:51.539 align:start position:0%
of of
 
00:24:51.539 --> 00:24:53.110 align:start position:0%
of of
um

00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:53.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:56.270 --> 00:24:56.280 align:start position:0%
unnecessary complexities and sources of
 
00:24:59.630 --> 00:24:59.640 align:start position:0%
confusion that were highlighted by the
 
00:25:00.970 --> 00:25:00.980 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State
 
00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:04.200 align:start position:0%
uh Mr Fitch last week
 
00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
um and even if we had that list even
 
00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:08.400 align:start position:0%
prior to knowing whether we agree
 
00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:10.260 align:start position:0%
right that every element of that list
 
00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:12.360 align:start position:0%
can be you know corrected in ways that
 
00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
are common sensible that would be useful
 
00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:17.580 align:start position:0%
right okay maybe that's what
 
00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:21.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:23.640 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean I I read what she sent to me
 
00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:26.940 align:start position:0%
last night and it was a
 
00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:30.240 align:start position:0%
a good summary of her take on
 
00:25:32.810 --> 00:25:32.820 align:start position:0%
on things like that and mixed in with
 
00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:34.980 align:start position:0%
some policy matters but
 
00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:38.100 align:start position:0%
I saw uh
 
00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
you know some amount of overlap between
 
00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:42.240 align:start position:0%
what she had picked up on and what I
 
00:25:55.789 --> 00:25:55.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:55.799 --> 00:26:01.130 align:start position:0%
 
Russia

00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:01.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:06.529 align:start position:0%
 
right

00:26:06.529 --> 00:26:06.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:13.909 --> 00:26:13.919 align:start position:0%
uh nothing significant in the brief time
 
00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:16.140 align:start position:0%
you were absent
 
00:26:18.169 --> 00:26:18.179 align:start position:0%
I might have missed something on my list
 
00:26:20.029 --> 00:26:20.039 align:start position:0%
in other words oh yes this may not I
 
00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
might have overlooked something it was
 
00:26:24.529 --> 00:26:24.539 align:start position:0%
if I did it was uh not intentional
 
00:26:29.690 --> 00:26:29.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:29.700 --> 00:27:11.210 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:27:11.210 --> 00:27:11.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:20.510 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
so how would you like to approach this
 
00:27:24.409 --> 00:27:24.419 align:start position:0%
because I'm thinking maybe we take this
 
00:27:27.049 --> 00:27:27.059 align:start position:0%
right up and just do a once over
 
00:27:27.059 --> 00:27:28.070 align:start position:0%
right up and just do a once over
together

00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
kind of like we did with the definitions
 
00:27:32.330 --> 00:27:32.340 align:start position:0%
a couple of weeks ago
 
00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
and I've got my notes on my write-up and
 
00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
we've got your
 
00:27:40.909 --> 00:27:40.919 align:start position:0%
helpful list that'll maybe help us Focus
 
00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:44.100 align:start position:0%
uh the first
 
00:27:45.850 --> 00:27:45.860 align:start position:0%
thing that kind of strikes my mind
 
00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:48.240 align:start position:0%
strikes me as
 
00:27:51.049 --> 00:27:51.059 align:start position:0%
the first line we have nine different
 
00:27:53.149 --> 00:27:53.159 align:start position:0%
types of registration
 
00:27:54.769 --> 00:27:54.779 align:start position:0%
or political
 
00:27:59.330 --> 00:27:59.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:00.950 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:03.240 align:start position:0%
we've discussed candidate committees in
 
00:28:05.149 --> 00:28:05.159 align:start position:0%
registering as a candidate
 
00:28:08.269 --> 00:28:08.279 align:start position:0%
and shared our views on that
 
00:28:08.279 --> 00:28:10.310 align:start position:0%
and shared our views on that
uh

00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:28:12.049 --> 00:28:12.059 align:start position:0%
are there any of those
 
00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:14.640 align:start position:0%
other seven that
 
00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
seem like they could be streamlined or
 
00:28:21.289 --> 00:28:21.299 align:start position:0%
subsumed into another category to you
 
00:28:21.299 --> 00:28:25.850 align:start position:0%
subsumed into another category to you
guys

00:28:25.850 --> 00:28:25.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:27.850 --> 00:28:27.860 align:start position:0%
work on
 
00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:29.750 align:start position:0%
work on
[Music]

00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:33.240 align:start position:0%
honors and independent expenditures we
 
00:28:36.590 --> 00:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
might be able to eliminate those and
 
00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:37.730 align:start position:0%
might be able to eliminate those and
then

00:28:37.730 --> 00:28:37.740 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:38.330 align:start position:0%
then
um

00:28:38.330 --> 00:28:38.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
how we look at what a candidate is and
 
00:28:43.909 --> 00:28:43.919 align:start position:0%
you can look at the way I think where
 
00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:46.500 align:start position:0%
the way I'm told is that in federal law
 
00:28:48.890 --> 00:28:48.900 align:start position:0%
they look at what the major purpose of
 
00:28:51.289 --> 00:28:51.299 align:start position:0%
an organization is and if the major
 
00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:54.320 align:start position:0%
purpose is supporting that candidate
 
00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:55.970 align:start position:0%
purpose is supporting that candidate
then

00:28:55.970 --> 00:28:55.980 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:28:59.210 --> 00:28:59.220 align:start position:0%
um that you can so it's basic and then
 
00:29:01.130 --> 00:29:01.140 align:start position:0%
anything that's not a major purpose and
 
00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
that would be the Super Pacs and those
 
00:29:08.149 --> 00:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
you would have them record when they
 
00:29:10.730 --> 00:29:10.740 align:start position:0%
expend money or or when they hit a
 
00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
certain level
 
00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:14.520 align:start position:0%
at least that's the way I understand it
 
00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
so it you could have the definition of a
 
00:29:21.730 --> 00:29:21.740 align:start position:0%
political committee
 
00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:24.120 align:start position:0%
just be much more General than what
 
00:29:26.269 --> 00:29:26.279 align:start position:0%
we've got here and then tie it to what
 
00:29:28.909 --> 00:29:28.919 align:start position:0%
they're expending and these are
 
00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:31.020 align:start position:0%
how people expand and these are
 
00:29:34.130 --> 00:29:34.140 align:start position:0%
categories at least when when I read
 
00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:36.480 align:start position:0%
stuff about campaign finance and I I
 
00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:39.000 align:start position:0%
actually read a couple different state
 
00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:41.460 align:start position:0%
statutes just to get an idea you know
 
00:29:43.610 --> 00:29:43.620 align:start position:0%
how they do it and is it it's not that
 
00:29:46.789 --> 00:29:46.799 align:start position:0%
different than how we're doing it here
 
00:29:49.789 --> 00:29:49.799 align:start position:0%
but to streamline it you would just make
 
00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
the definition of political committee as
 
00:29:54.529 --> 00:29:54.539 align:start position:0%
generic as you can and tie the
 
00:29:57.649 --> 00:29:57.659 align:start position:0%
distinction to either the major purpose
 
00:30:00.049 --> 00:30:00.059 align:start position:0%
of it or the expenditures in the
 
00:30:02.210 --> 00:30:02.220 align:start position:0%
independent expenditures but then
 
00:30:05.029 --> 00:30:05.039 align:start position:0%
because a Super PAC
 
00:30:10.370 --> 00:30:10.380 align:start position:0%
at least is a type of pack
 
00:30:13.669 --> 00:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
but it's the pack is organized to
 
00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:16.320 align:start position:0%
support usually the candidate and is
 
00:30:19.549 --> 00:30:19.559 align:start position:0%
tied to the candidate a Super PAC is not
 
00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:23.700 align:start position:0%
okay so you have to be clear about
 
00:30:26.210 --> 00:30:26.220 align:start position:0%
um coordination and what constitutes
 
00:30:28.010 --> 00:30:28.020 align:start position:0%
coordination and I think that's what
 
00:30:29.810 --> 00:30:29.820 align:start position:0%
Ross was getting to because he didn't
 
00:30:31.490 --> 00:30:31.500 align:start position:0%
like the super Pacs coming in he wanted
 
00:30:33.649 --> 00:30:33.659 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we had coordination
 
00:30:35.450 --> 00:30:35.460 align:start position:0%
because it's not defined right now in
 
00:30:37.730 --> 00:30:37.740 align:start position:0%
our statute what coordination is
 
00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:39.169 align:start position:0%
our statute what coordination is
so

00:30:39.169 --> 00:30:39.179 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:30:41.450 --> 00:30:41.460 align:start position:0%
I'm kind of rambling but I think there's
 
00:30:43.909 --> 00:30:43.919 align:start position:0%
a way to do it I just haven't set pen to
 
00:30:48.590 --> 00:30:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:50.510 --> 00:30:50.520 align:start position:0%
well with what we're doing here certain
 
00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
amount of brainstorming is going to be
 
00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:53.750 align:start position:0%
amount of brainstorming is going to be
helpful

00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
00:30:56.090 --> 00:30:56.100 align:start position:0%
seems to me
 
00:31:01.669 --> 00:31:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:01.679 --> 00:31:06.529 align:start position:0%
 
well

00:31:06.529 --> 00:31:06.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:06.539 --> 00:31:10.789 align:start position:0%
 
now

00:31:10.789 --> 00:31:10.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:14.330 --> 00:31:14.340 align:start position:0%
two and three candidate committee and
 
00:31:17.450 --> 00:31:17.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:20.210 --> 00:31:20.220 align:start position:0%
I mean we know well there was there was
 
00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:21.110 align:start position:0%
I mean we know well there was there was
a

00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:23.360 align:start position:0%
there was one
 
00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:28.260 align:start position:0%
detail in the reporting periods that I
 
00:31:31.070 --> 00:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
thought should be straightforward to fix
 
00:31:35.450 --> 00:31:35.460 align:start position:0%
and it it mentions in a couple of places
 
00:31:42.889 --> 00:31:42.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
where the language is uh
 
00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:48.360 align:start position:0%
in one place a couple of places in the
 
00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:49.370 align:start position:0%
in one place a couple of places in the
statutes

00:31:49.370 --> 00:31:49.380 align:start position:0%
statutes
 
00:31:52.130 --> 00:31:52.140 align:start position:0%
for what is reported
 
00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
by a reporting deadline let's say the
 
00:31:56.389 --> 00:31:56.399 align:start position:0%
reporting you have to get the report in
 
00:31:58.970 --> 00:31:58.980 align:start position:0%
by the end of Wednesday
 
00:32:01.549 --> 00:32:01.559 align:start position:0%
and in some places in the statutes it
 
00:32:04.130 --> 00:32:04.140 align:start position:0%
says it will include
 
00:32:06.289 --> 00:32:06.299 align:start position:0%
all activity
 
00:32:10.730 --> 00:32:10.740 align:start position:0%
reportable activity up to and including
 
00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:12.769 align:start position:0%
reportable activity up to and including
uh

00:32:12.769 --> 00:32:12.779 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:15.480 align:start position:0%
Monday another places it says up to
 
00:32:17.870 --> 00:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
Monday I think that's uh the two ways of
 
00:32:19.310 --> 00:32:19.320 align:start position:0%
saying it
 
00:32:22.250 --> 00:32:22.260 align:start position:0%
and that's a bit ambiguous I mean up to
 
00:32:24.590 --> 00:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
including makes it very clear
 
00:32:26.690 --> 00:32:26.700 align:start position:0%
it would be through Monday
 
00:32:29.269 --> 00:32:29.279 align:start position:0%
up to might
 
00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:31.440 align:start position:0%
strictly speaking include only through
 
00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:32.389 align:start position:0%
strictly speaking include only through
Sunday

00:32:32.389 --> 00:32:32.399 align:start position:0%
Sunday
 
00:32:34.610 --> 00:32:34.620 align:start position:0%
correct so that seems like an incon
 
00:32:36.529 --> 00:32:36.539 align:start position:0%
that's an inconsistency that I think
 
00:32:38.289 --> 00:32:38.299 align:start position:0%
should be
 
00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:55.909 --> 00:32:55.919 align:start position:0%
six Roman numeral two dash a right yep
 
00:32:58.730 --> 00:32:58.740 align:start position:0%
uh it's footnote number two
 
00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:00.649 align:start position:0%
uh it's footnote number two
yeah

00:33:00.649 --> 00:33:00.659 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:33:02.090 --> 00:33:02.100 align:start position:0%
oh okay
 
00:33:07.450 --> 00:33:07.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:12.049 --> 00:33:12.059 align:start position:0%
664 colon six Roman numeral two and six
 
00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
sixty four six Roman numeral one
 
00:33:18.649 --> 00:33:18.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:20.389 --> 00:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
when I was filing my reports I just
 
00:33:22.549 --> 00:33:22.559 align:start position:0%
assumed it was through Monday
 
00:33:24.409 --> 00:33:24.419 align:start position:0%
and two days later you filed the report
 
00:33:26.149 --> 00:33:26.159 align:start position:0%
I was not aware of this inconsistency
 
00:33:26.159 --> 00:33:28.190 align:start position:0%
I was not aware of this inconsistency
well

00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:28.200 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:33:30.769 --> 00:33:30.779 align:start position:0%
and and I think
 
00:33:33.529 --> 00:33:33.539 align:start position:0%
so so do you want to make it include
 
00:33:36.769 --> 00:33:36.779 align:start position:0%
Monday or not I I don't do people have
 
00:33:39.289 --> 00:33:39.299 align:start position:0%
time to I mean is that too much to ask
 
00:33:41.930 --> 00:33:41.940 align:start position:0%
not maybe not so much for the larger
 
00:33:44.149 --> 00:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
campaigns but
 
00:33:46.490 --> 00:33:46.500 align:start position:0%
for the 400 of us that don't have larger
 
00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:49.080 align:start position:0%
campaigns is that or do you want to cut
 
00:33:50.930 --> 00:33:50.940 align:start position:0%
it off on Sunday
 
00:33:52.490 --> 00:33:52.500 align:start position:0%
I don't actually have a preference I
 
00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
just think it should be one or the other
 
00:33:58.909 --> 00:33:58.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:58.919 --> 00:33:59.930 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:33:59.930 --> 00:33:59.940 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:11.510 align:start position:0%
so
someday

00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:13.010 --> 00:34:13.020 align:start position:0%
and then there's a lot of different
 
00:34:14.990 --> 00:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
dollar amounts I guess we can talk about
 
00:34:17.389 --> 00:34:17.399 align:start position:0%
that at some point trying to make the
 
00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:20.280 align:start position:0%
dollar amounts as consistent as possible
 
00:34:24.050 --> 00:34:24.060 align:start position:0%
but we might not be able to do that
 
00:34:25.790 --> 00:34:25.800 align:start position:0%
right when you start we start talking
 
00:34:27.649 --> 00:34:27.659 align:start position:0%
about dollar amounts that's starting to
 
00:34:30.589 --> 00:34:30.599 align:start position:0%
be a policy thing right and I'm not
 
00:34:31.849 --> 00:34:31.859 align:start position:0%
saying we shouldn't talk about them I'm
 
00:34:33.770 --> 00:34:33.780 align:start position:0%
just saying let's do these things the
 
00:34:36.169 --> 00:34:36.179 align:start position:0%
easy things yeah do do the things we
 
00:34:39.349 --> 00:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
think we're likely to agree on because
 
00:34:41.810 --> 00:34:41.820 align:start position:0%
resolving an inconsistency in two parts
 
00:34:45.349 --> 00:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
of the statute on what the cutoff is I
 
00:34:48.169 --> 00:34:48.179 align:start position:0%
actually think that's pretty important
 
00:34:49.849 --> 00:34:49.859 align:start position:0%
there was a
 
00:34:52.070 --> 00:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
an example of an inconsistency in the
 
00:34:54.349 --> 00:34:54.359 align:start position:0%
statutes back in 2000 I think it was
 
00:34:54.359 --> 00:34:56.270 align:start position:0%
statutes back in 2000 I think it was
2017.

00:34:56.270 --> 00:34:56.280 align:start position:0%
2017.
 
00:34:58.609 --> 00:34:58.619 align:start position:0%
uh it was a
 
00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:00.720 align:start position:0%
really severe winter storm on Town
 
00:35:02.210 --> 00:35:02.220 align:start position:0%
election day
 
00:35:05.690 --> 00:35:05.700 align:start position:0%
uh I think the first two people remember
 
00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
that right
 
00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
and a significant proportion of the Town
 
00:35:13.970 --> 00:35:13.980 align:start position:0%
moderators in the affected areas
 
00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
read one portion of the statute that
 
00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
made it sound very clear that they had
 
00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
the authority to delay the election
 
00:35:25.069 --> 00:35:25.079 align:start position:0%
a postponed the election because of
 
00:35:26.690 --> 00:35:26.700 align:start position:0%
severe weather
 
00:35:30.370 --> 00:35:30.380 align:start position:0%
and there was a another
 
00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:32.030 align:start position:0%
and there was a another
statute

00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:32.040 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:33.950 align:start position:0%
statute
that

00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:33.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:35.990 align:start position:0%
that
stated

00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
stated
 
00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
that the towns were required to hold the
 
00:35:39.890 --> 00:35:39.900 align:start position:0%
election on that particular day you all
 
00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
remember that
 
00:35:44.109 --> 00:35:44.119 align:start position:0%
and the Secretary of State came down
 
00:35:46.430 --> 00:35:46.440 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State Gardner
 
00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
it was his
 
00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:50.510 align:start position:0%
it was his
uh

00:35:50.510 --> 00:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
controlling opinion that it was the
 
00:35:55.609 --> 00:35:55.619 align:start position:0%
latter it was had to be on Tuesday
 
00:35:57.530 --> 00:35:57.540 align:start position:0%
so that how long did it take to were you
 
00:35:59.390 --> 00:35:59.400 align:start position:0%
in the legislation yeah hello that take
 
00:36:02.089 --> 00:36:02.099 align:start position:0%
I was a selectman and I it took us I
 
00:36:04.069 --> 00:36:04.079 align:start position:0%
think most of the year
 
00:36:06.170 --> 00:36:06.180 align:start position:0%
right to get a bill passed that where
 
00:36:07.849 --> 00:36:07.859 align:start position:0%
the select where the Selectmen had to
 
00:36:10.130 --> 00:36:10.140 align:start position:0%
say yes this was a valid election took
 
00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:15.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:17.950 --> 00:36:17.960 align:start position:0%
in a round I had not been a legislator
 
00:36:21.109 --> 00:36:21.119 align:start position:0%
when that happened but the next year oh
 
00:36:27.829 --> 00:36:27.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:29.870 --> 00:36:29.880 align:start position:0%
and we came up with a bill that that
 
00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:31.800 align:start position:0%
supposedly fixed it but
 
00:36:36.050 --> 00:36:36.060 align:start position:0%
um it that was that was a dance too so
 
00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
well in the town election we had
 
00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
recently in early March it happened
 
00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:41.569 align:start position:0%
recently in early March it happened
again

00:36:41.569 --> 00:36:41.579 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:36:44.329 --> 00:36:44.339 align:start position:0%
it happened again and the the moderators
 
00:36:46.670 --> 00:36:46.680 align:start position:0%
had the clear authority to postpone
 
00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:47.750 align:start position:0%
had the clear authority to postpone
right

00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:36:49.130 --> 00:36:49.140 align:start position:0%
it was a good thing because I had over
 
00:36:52.490 --> 00:36:52.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:55.310 --> 00:36:55.320 align:start position:0%
in fact I was still digging out on there
 
00:36:57.650 --> 00:36:57.660 align:start position:0%
and couldn't make our postpone election
 
00:37:00.829 --> 00:37:00.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:03.650 --> 00:37:03.660 align:start position:0%
so anyway so there's an exam there's an
 
00:37:06.349 --> 00:37:06.359 align:start position:0%
example of why consistency between the
 
00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:08.040 align:start position:0%
statutes is important we all knew this
 
00:37:10.609 --> 00:37:10.619 align:start position:0%
but I think of that every time I look at
 
00:37:14.690 --> 00:37:14.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:17.450 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:37:17.450 --> 00:37:17.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:20.750 --> 00:37:20.760 align:start position:0%
I I see I mean there are some of us who
 
00:37:23.089 --> 00:37:23.099 align:start position:0%
do pay attention to details and for
 
00:37:24.530 --> 00:37:24.540 align:start position:0%
people like that where the details don't
 
00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
match up it can be a barrier too to
 
00:37:30.170 --> 00:37:30.180 align:start position:0%
getting involved we don't want that
 
00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
all right so there's one
 
00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:54.349 align:start position:0%
all right so there's one
okay

00:37:54.349 --> 00:37:54.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:57.829 --> 00:37:57.839 align:start position:0%
so reporting deadlines
 
00:38:01.910 --> 00:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
number three on Page Six
 
00:38:04.069 --> 00:38:04.079 align:start position:0%
I think that's what Russia were reading
 
00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:17.810 --> 00:38:17.820 align:start position:0%
yeah he was talking about I think
 
00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:19.849 align:start position:0%
yeah he was talking about I think
um

00:38:19.849 --> 00:38:19.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:22.609 --> 00:38:22.619 align:start position:0%
Mr Fitch was talking about how it's a
 
00:38:25.130 --> 00:38:25.140 align:start position:0%
two-pronged test you have to you have to
 
00:38:26.870 --> 00:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
form and spin
 
00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:29.510 align:start position:0%
form and spin
okay

00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:38.510 --> 00:38:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:40.910 --> 00:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
do not have a duty to register unless
 
00:39:01.630 --> 00:39:01.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
I don't know the
 
00:39:07.730 --> 00:39:07.740 align:start position:0%
I will go through my notes before our
 
00:39:09.230 --> 00:39:09.240 align:start position:0%
next meeting and come up with a nice
 
00:39:12.050 --> 00:39:12.060 align:start position:0%
list like you did right
 
00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:18.770 align:start position:0%
list like you did right
[Music]

00:39:18.770 --> 00:39:18.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:20.930 --> 00:39:20.940 align:start position:0%
Marshall that's when they have to and
 
00:39:23.390 --> 00:39:23.400 align:start position:0%
like you said the pilot that gets into
 
00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:25.190 align:start position:0%
like you said the pilot that gets into
policy

00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:25.200 align:start position:0%
policy
 
00:39:28.190 --> 00:39:28.200 align:start position:0%
about the number but we can we agree
 
00:39:30.770 --> 00:39:30.780 align:start position:0%
that once we hit a number
 
00:39:36.410 --> 00:39:36.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
when they either hit a number of
 
00:39:41.089 --> 00:39:41.099 align:start position:0%
expenditures or donors
 
00:39:44.810 --> 00:39:44.820 align:start position:0%
then they have to start reporting or is
 
00:39:48.109 --> 00:39:48.119 align:start position:0%
it just expenditures because if we're
 
00:39:51.410 --> 00:39:51.420 align:start position:0%
working on transparency
 
00:39:53.870 --> 00:39:53.880 align:start position:0%
we're really trying to find out what
 
00:39:56.270 --> 00:39:56.280 align:start position:0%
they're spending right
 
00:39:58.310 --> 00:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
so if they've collected a lot of money
 
00:40:00.470 --> 00:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
but they're not spending it
 
00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:06.170 --> 00:40:06.180 align:start position:0%
I don't know no I know what you're
 
00:40:09.650 --> 00:40:09.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:11.450 --> 00:40:11.460 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking
 
00:40:13.970 --> 00:40:13.980 align:start position:0%
and I don't have a real solid opinion on
 
00:40:16.670 --> 00:40:16.680 align:start position:0%
this yet so I'm just kind of yeah
 
00:40:18.829 --> 00:40:18.839 align:start position:0%
thinking out loud I mean they're both
 
00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:24.470 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:40:24.470 --> 00:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:40:26.810 --> 00:40:26.820 align:start position:0%
your your thoughts on what was you know
 
00:40:28.970 --> 00:40:28.980 align:start position:0%
the purpose of campaign Finance system
 
00:40:31.310 --> 00:40:31.320 align:start position:0%
mine were a little
 
00:40:34.069 --> 00:40:34.079 align:start position:0%
uh simpler than yours but there was some
 
00:40:37.069 --> 00:40:37.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:39.950 --> 00:40:39.960 align:start position:0%
and I'm still thinking this through but
 
00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
yeah the purpose of
 
00:40:46.370 --> 00:40:46.380 align:start position:0%
we know that in our election system
 
00:40:50.390 --> 00:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:54.349 --> 00:40:54.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:57.290 --> 00:40:57.300 align:start position:0%
I go back right to the the root of the
 
00:40:58.730 --> 00:40:58.740 align:start position:0%
legitimacy of our former government
 
00:41:01.849 --> 00:41:01.859 align:start position:0%
which is it's it's laid out in the
 
00:41:03.589 --> 00:41:03.599 align:start position:0%
Declaration of Independence
 
00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:07.200 align:start position:0%
that the just powers of governments uh
 
00:41:08.630 --> 00:41:08.640 align:start position:0%
derive from the consent of the
 
00:41:11.210 --> 00:41:11.220 align:start position:0%
government that's self-evident according
 
00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:13.560 align:start position:0%
to the founders there's not something to
 
00:41:15.530 --> 00:41:15.540 align:start position:0%
discuss or argue it's self-evident you
 
00:41:17.390 --> 00:41:17.400 align:start position:0%
don't have to prove it
 
00:41:19.190 --> 00:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
I like that I like when they're making
 
00:41:21.530 --> 00:41:21.540 align:start position:0%
it clear where they're starting from so
 
00:41:22.790 --> 00:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
it depends on the consent of the
 
00:41:24.650 --> 00:41:24.660 align:start position:0%
government and our election law system
 
00:41:26.750 --> 00:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
is how we go about ensuring we have that
 
00:41:29.089 --> 00:41:29.099 align:start position:0%
consent right that makes sense
 
00:41:29.099 --> 00:41:30.290 align:start position:0%
consent right that makes sense
but

00:41:30.290 --> 00:41:30.300 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:33.000 align:start position:0%
you know what requirements does the
 
00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
election law system have to fulfill in
 
00:41:37.069 --> 00:41:37.079 align:start position:0%
order to do that well I see two broad
 
00:41:37.079 --> 00:41:38.390 align:start position:0%
order to do that well I see two broad
categories

00:41:38.390 --> 00:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
categories
 
00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:40.370 align:start position:0%
categories
well

00:41:40.370 --> 00:41:40.380 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:42.720 align:start position:0%
we need to make an accurate assessment
 
00:41:45.109 --> 00:41:45.119 align:start position:0%
of the sentiment of the
 
00:41:46.849 --> 00:41:46.859 align:start position:0%
the voting public you know the people
 
00:41:49.250 --> 00:41:49.260 align:start position:0%
who have the franchise
 
00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:51.240 align:start position:0%
and we have to do it in such a way that
 
00:41:53.329 --> 00:41:53.339 align:start position:0%
we retain their confidence that it's
 
00:41:56.030 --> 00:41:56.040 align:start position:0%
that it is accurate
 
00:41:59.270 --> 00:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
and to do it accurately
 
00:42:01.069 --> 00:42:01.079 align:start position:0%
well one of the things required to
 
00:42:04.130 --> 00:42:04.140 align:start position:0%
retain the confidence is that this
 
00:42:04.140 --> 00:42:05.210 align:start position:0%
retain the confidence is that this
system

00:42:05.210 --> 00:42:05.220 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
be transparent so and by that I mean
 
00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:09.240 align:start position:0%
people can readily understand what's
 
00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
going on and I can see campaign finances
 
00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:14.040 align:start position:0%
coming under that requirement the need
 
00:42:17.089 --> 00:42:17.099 align:start position:0%
for transparency and specifically it
 
00:42:18.349 --> 00:42:18.359 align:start position:0%
kicks in
 
00:42:18.359 --> 00:42:20.329 align:start position:0%
kicks in
uh

00:42:20.329 --> 00:42:20.339 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:42:23.810 --> 00:42:23.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:28.250 --> 00:42:28.260 align:start position:0%
uh undue influence I think that was
 
00:42:29.990 --> 00:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
kind of at the heart of what we're
 
00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
concerned about
 
00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:32.569 align:start position:0%
concerned about
and

00:42:32.569 --> 00:42:32.579 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:42:35.270 --> 00:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
particularly we we don't want there to
 
00:42:37.130 --> 00:42:37.140 align:start position:0%
be covert
 
00:42:40.370 --> 00:42:40.380 align:start position:0%
undue influence if somebody is pumping
 
00:42:42.950 --> 00:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
enough money into a particular political
 
00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:43.970 align:start position:0%
enough money into a particular political
effort

00:42:43.970 --> 00:42:43.980 align:start position:0%
effort
 
00:42:45.950 --> 00:42:45.960 align:start position:0%
that the money itself might be
 
00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:47.690 align:start position:0%
that the money itself might be
influencing

00:42:47.690 --> 00:42:47.700 align:start position:0%
influencing
 
00:42:51.410 --> 00:42:51.420 align:start position:0%
uh the actions of the
 
00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:54.109 align:start position:0%
uh the actions of the
candidate

00:42:54.109 --> 00:42:54.119 align:start position:0%
candidate
 
00:42:55.849 --> 00:42:55.859 align:start position:0%
I don't know that we can stop that but
 
00:42:59.390 --> 00:42:59.400 align:start position:0%
we've the public should know about it
 
00:43:01.849 --> 00:43:01.859 align:start position:0%
so that's that's what I that's how I see
 
00:43:04.730 --> 00:43:04.740 align:start position:0%
it here preventing undoing
 
00:43:06.589 --> 00:43:06.599 align:start position:0%
making sure everybody's aware if there's
 
00:43:08.270 --> 00:43:08.280 align:start position:0%
a possibility of undue influence well
 
00:43:11.150 --> 00:43:11.160 align:start position:0%
that's our requirement right and the
 
00:43:13.609 --> 00:43:13.619 align:start position:0%
amounts of money involved of course
 
00:43:15.230 --> 00:43:15.240 align:start position:0%
that's that's where it gets to be policy
 
00:43:17.390 --> 00:43:17.400 align:start position:0%
what is that amount of money and there's
 
00:43:19.010 --> 00:43:19.020 align:start position:0%
there's room for reasonable people that
 
00:43:20.990 --> 00:43:21.000 align:start position:0%
disagree on that too
 
00:43:23.510 --> 00:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
I think an estate representative Race
 
00:43:26.329 --> 00:43:26.339 align:start position:0%
For example where we're
 
00:43:29.390 --> 00:43:29.400 align:start position:0%
we're making a hundred dollars a year
 
00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
before taxes
 
00:43:34.130 --> 00:43:34.140 align:start position:0%
and I don't think there are very many of
 
00:43:37.550 --> 00:43:37.560 align:start position:0%
the 400 that are or of the 24 senators
 
00:43:39.530 --> 00:43:39.540 align:start position:0%
are doing it for direct financial
 
00:43:42.410 --> 00:43:42.420 align:start position:0%
reasons I think it's so maybe the
 
00:43:43.670 --> 00:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
threshold makes sense for those
 
00:43:46.550 --> 00:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
thresholds reporting to be lower
 
00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:48.890 align:start position:0%
thresholds reporting to be lower
uh

00:43:48.890 --> 00:43:48.900 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:43:52.370 --> 00:43:52.380 align:start position:0%
higher level you know uh
 
00:43:55.370 --> 00:43:55.380 align:start position:0%
levels of uh races that involve more
 
00:43:57.710 --> 00:43:57.720 align:start position:0%
constituents for the candidate
 
00:44:00.650 --> 00:44:00.660 align:start position:0%
and hence more money to reach them
 
00:44:02.690 --> 00:44:02.700 align:start position:0%
and those those thresholds are different
 
00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:03.890 align:start position:0%
and those those thresholds are different
right

00:44:03.890 --> 00:44:03.900 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:44:04.970 --> 00:44:04.980 align:start position:0%
right so the principle of having
 
00:44:04.980 --> 00:44:06.230 align:start position:0%
right so the principle of having
thresholds

00:44:06.230 --> 00:44:06.240 align:start position:0%
thresholds
 
00:44:08.990 --> 00:44:09.000 align:start position:0%
I think we can agree on but then the
 
00:44:11.210 --> 00:44:11.220 align:start position:0%
it becomes a question of finding the
 
00:44:13.790 --> 00:44:13.800 align:start position:0%
amount we can agree on yep
 
00:44:15.230 --> 00:44:15.240 align:start position:0%
I expect we could have lots of
 
00:44:18.470 --> 00:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
discussion on we have in the past right
 
00:44:20.270 --> 00:44:20.280 align:start position:0%
so I'm still looking for easy pickups
 
00:44:22.490 --> 00:44:22.500 align:start position:0%
here I guess okay uh one question
 
00:44:25.609 --> 00:44:25.619 align:start position:0%
something that's unclear to me
 
00:44:25.619 --> 00:44:27.950 align:start position:0%
something that's unclear to me
uh

00:44:27.950 --> 00:44:27.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:44:30.530 --> 00:44:30.540 align:start position:0%
what is the date range that applies to a
 
00:44:33.050 --> 00:44:33.060 align:start position:0%
given election cycle we see that you had
 
00:44:35.089 --> 00:44:35.099 align:start position:0%
that question too in your list yeah and
 
00:44:37.010 --> 00:44:37.020 align:start position:0%
I had the same question I mean I would
 
00:44:39.170 --> 00:44:39.180 align:start position:0%
like an answer to it
 
00:44:43.250 --> 00:44:43.260 align:start position:0%
uh we hear about election cycle quite a
 
00:44:45.170 --> 00:44:45.180 align:start position:0%
bit but I haven't seen a definition as
 
00:44:47.390 --> 00:44:47.400 align:start position:0%
to when a particular two-year we know
 
00:44:49.550 --> 00:44:49.560 align:start position:0%
it's two years because elections are
 
00:44:51.470 --> 00:44:51.480 align:start position:0%
every two years when does the previous
 
00:44:54.849 --> 00:44:54.859 align:start position:0%
election cycle in what date
 
00:44:57.349 --> 00:44:57.359 align:start position:0%
is that defined anywhere I haven't seen
 
00:45:00.290 --> 00:45:00.300 align:start position:0%
it in our statute no action cycle or
 
00:45:03.530 --> 00:45:03.540 align:start position:0%
election it's not but I I mean for me
 
00:45:05.990 --> 00:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
and I I know that Ross we we talked
 
00:45:08.510 --> 00:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
about misconcerns about paying off you
 
00:45:11.809 --> 00:45:11.819 align:start position:0%
know loans and stuff like that but yeah
 
00:45:15.250 --> 00:45:15.260 align:start position:0%
we could do that the election cycle
 
00:45:17.990 --> 00:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
starts the day after the general
 
00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:19.069 align:start position:0%
starts the day after the general
election

00:45:19.069 --> 00:45:19.079 align:start position:0%
election
 
00:45:22.069 --> 00:45:22.079 align:start position:0%
the next cycle okay the next like so the
 
00:45:26.990 --> 00:45:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:30.109 --> 00:45:30.119 align:start position:0%
it's the election cycle
 
00:45:33.109 --> 00:45:33.119 align:start position:0%
what gets confusing however is what
 
00:45:36.109 --> 00:45:36.119 align:start position:0%
happens in that situation where you're
 
00:45:38.210 --> 00:45:38.220 align:start position:0%
still out there campaigning after you
 
00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:39.170 align:start position:0%
still out there campaigning after you
win

00:45:39.170 --> 00:45:39.180 align:start position:0%
win
 
00:45:41.650 --> 00:45:41.660 align:start position:0%
and you get money to pay off your loan
 
00:45:45.290 --> 00:45:45.300 align:start position:0%
how do you where what money is that
 
00:45:49.010 --> 00:45:49.020 align:start position:0%
going to is that going to the new one or
 
00:45:50.930 --> 00:45:50.940 align:start position:0%
is it going to the old one
 
00:45:53.329 --> 00:45:53.339 align:start position:0%
or do we say if it's going towards
 
00:45:56.329 --> 00:45:56.339 align:start position:0%
expenditures that were made
 
00:46:01.190 --> 00:46:01.200 align:start position:0%
and let's say 22 right I understand
 
00:46:03.109 --> 00:46:03.119 align:start position:0%
then it would be for the previous
 
00:46:05.930 --> 00:46:05.940 align:start position:0%
election cycle if it's going to go
 
00:46:09.050 --> 00:46:09.060 align:start position:0%
towards 24
 
00:46:11.870 --> 00:46:11.880 align:start position:0%
that's the next one right right yeah
 
00:46:15.230 --> 00:46:15.240 align:start position:0%
then you it would you'd have to put it
 
00:46:18.349 --> 00:46:18.359 align:start position:0%
there in that one as a donation
 
00:46:20.930 --> 00:46:20.940 align:start position:0%
so it would it would I guess be for
 
00:46:23.450 --> 00:46:23.460 align:start position:0%
expenditures that were made during that
 
00:46:25.550 --> 00:46:25.560 align:start position:0%
election cycle
 
00:46:28.550 --> 00:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
I think that works but I don't know for
 
00:46:30.349 --> 00:46:30.359 align:start position:0%
sure and I still don't know what to do
 
00:46:32.809 --> 00:46:32.819 align:start position:0%
with excess but we can talk about that
 
00:46:32.819 --> 00:46:35.690 align:start position:0%
with excess but we can talk about that
later

00:46:35.690 --> 00:46:35.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:37.790 --> 00:46:37.800 align:start position:0%
but that's one definition that I've seen
 
00:46:40.970 --> 00:46:40.980 align:start position:0%
and it kind of also encompasses
 
00:46:43.849 --> 00:46:43.859 align:start position:0%
if you're doing the exploratory or if
 
00:46:45.890 --> 00:46:45.900 align:start position:0%
you're starting to because people start
 
00:46:48.530 --> 00:46:48.540 align:start position:0%
campaigning well before June when we
 
00:46:51.410 --> 00:46:51.420 align:start position:0%
have to file well with a with a two-year
 
00:46:54.050 --> 00:46:54.060 align:start position:0%
cycle it's yeah you know when does the
 
00:46:56.690 --> 00:46:56.700 align:start position:0%
campaigning really stop especially for
 
00:46:59.690 --> 00:46:59.700 align:start position:0%
the the races with more constituents yes
 
00:47:02.390 --> 00:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
you know State Senate and yeah yeah in
 
00:47:04.309 --> 00:47:04.319 align:start position:0%
theory while running we're running now
 
00:47:04.319 --> 00:47:05.630 align:start position:0%
theory while running we're running now
but

00:47:05.630 --> 00:47:05.640 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:47:08.450 --> 00:47:08.460 align:start position:0%
I'm not knocking on doors yet
 
00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:10.190 align:start position:0%
I'm not knocking on doors yet
so

00:47:10.190 --> 00:47:10.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:47:12.290 --> 00:47:12.300 align:start position:0%
but anyway that was one
 
00:47:16.670 --> 00:47:16.680 align:start position:0%
that I saw sometimes they do it
 
00:47:18.829 --> 00:47:18.839 align:start position:0%
I was looking at like I said some of
 
00:47:20.270 --> 00:47:20.280 align:start position:0%
these other statutes I'll look at some
 
00:47:21.890 --> 00:47:21.900 align:start position:0%
of the other ones again and see how they
 
00:47:25.069 --> 00:47:25.079 align:start position:0%
Define it but that one kind of stuck out
 
00:47:28.270 --> 00:47:28.280 align:start position:0%
and it seemed easy
 
00:47:31.309 --> 00:47:31.319 align:start position:0%
to do yeah I'm
 
00:47:34.490 --> 00:47:34.500 align:start position:0%
I think I was thinking about this also
 
00:47:36.109 --> 00:47:36.119 align:start position:0%
I was
 
00:47:38.930 --> 00:47:38.940 align:start position:0%
and I understood the concern we
 
00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
discussed the thought we discussed last
 
00:47:44.569 --> 00:47:44.579 align:start position:0%
week which had to do with generating
 
00:47:46.970 --> 00:47:46.980 align:start position:0%
additional Surplus after election day
 
00:47:50.270 --> 00:47:50.280 align:start position:0%
which then is not accounted for in
 
00:47:52.309 --> 00:47:52.319 align:start position:0%
contribution can be rolled over to the
 
00:47:56.390 --> 00:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:56.400 --> 00:47:58.309 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:47:58.309 --> 00:47:58.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:47:59.750 --> 00:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to use the term loophole
 
00:48:01.430 --> 00:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
because I kind of
 
00:48:04.069 --> 00:48:04.079 align:start position:0%
I just hear that too much I guess to me
 
00:48:07.069 --> 00:48:07.079 align:start position:0%
it's if something is within the law it's
 
00:48:09.290 --> 00:48:09.300 align:start position:0%
within I'm not a lawyer so maybe I'm
 
00:48:11.569 --> 00:48:11.579 align:start position:0%
simple minded on this but if it's within
 
00:48:13.130 --> 00:48:13.140 align:start position:0%
the law it should be considered within
 
00:48:14.270 --> 00:48:14.280 align:start position:0%
the law
 
00:48:16.730 --> 00:48:16.740 align:start position:0%
and it's not actionable by the
 
00:48:18.650 --> 00:48:18.660 align:start position:0%
government now people can have their
 
00:48:20.270 --> 00:48:20.280 align:start position:0%
opinion on it that's a whole you have a
 
00:48:21.890 --> 00:48:21.900 align:start position:0%
right to opinions but
 
00:48:23.089 --> 00:48:23.099 align:start position:0%
but anyway
 
00:48:25.849 --> 00:48:25.859 align:start position:0%
uh I understand the question we
 
00:48:28.790 --> 00:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
discussed last week about someone keeps
 
00:48:31.190 --> 00:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
accepting donations after election day
 
00:48:34.670 --> 00:48:34.680 align:start position:0%
and builds a larger Surplus
 
00:48:36.770 --> 00:48:36.780 align:start position:0%
maybe that would be a way to approach it
 
00:48:38.210 --> 00:48:38.220 align:start position:0%
if you have
 
00:48:39.710 --> 00:48:39.720 align:start position:0%
a debt
 
00:48:44.589 --> 00:48:44.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:47.390 --> 00:48:47.400 align:start position:0%
people should be able to raise funds to
 
00:48:49.490 --> 00:48:49.500 align:start position:0%
pay off that debt
 
00:48:53.690 --> 00:48:53.700 align:start position:0%
uh if they can't pay off a debt with
 
00:48:55.849 --> 00:48:55.859 align:start position:0%
donations after election day that that
 
00:48:58.250 --> 00:48:58.260 align:start position:0%
could also be a barrier to people of
 
00:49:02.329 --> 00:49:02.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:05.750 --> 00:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
maybe it would make sense to say you
 
00:49:08.030 --> 00:49:08.040 align:start position:0%
you can't accumulate any additional
 
00:49:13.250 --> 00:49:13.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:14.870 --> 00:49:14.880 align:start position:0%
it's just this is just like the
 
00:49:16.490 --> 00:49:16.500 align:start position:0%
beginnings of a thought
 
00:49:19.010 --> 00:49:19.020 align:start position:0%
had to look at if I'd have to look at it
 
00:49:20.450 --> 00:49:20.460 align:start position:0%
from a lot of different angles before I
 
00:49:22.910 --> 00:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
concluded it made sense but it's it's
 
00:49:24.770 --> 00:49:24.780 align:start position:0%
maybe an approach
 
00:49:26.990 --> 00:49:27.000 align:start position:0%
if you have a debt to pay off
 
00:49:29.270 --> 00:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
you can collect and
 
00:49:32.990 --> 00:49:33.000 align:start position:0%
on on the previous election cycle you
 
00:49:35.690 --> 00:49:35.700 align:start position:0%
can accept donations until you've paid
 
00:49:37.430 --> 00:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
the debt off and then from then on they
 
00:49:40.010 --> 00:49:40.020 align:start position:0%
have to go into the next cycle
 
00:49:41.630 --> 00:49:41.640 align:start position:0%
which would be the current cycle after
 
00:49:44.569 --> 00:49:44.579 align:start position:0%
election day is that making okay
 
00:49:49.250 --> 00:49:49.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:50.630 --> 00:49:50.640 align:start position:0%
yeah okay let's
 
00:49:53.990 --> 00:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
either be an expenditure or it was
 
00:49:56.210 --> 00:49:56.220 align:start position:0%
incurred I guess in other words you
 
00:49:58.670 --> 00:49:58.680 align:start position:0%
might incur it but not have yet paid for
 
00:49:58.680 --> 00:49:59.510 align:start position:0%
might incur it but not have yet paid for
it

00:49:59.510 --> 00:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:50:01.010 --> 00:50:01.020 align:start position:0%
so it depends on how you define your
 
00:50:04.970 --> 00:50:04.980 align:start position:0%
expenditure but I think you know I think
 
00:50:07.609 --> 00:50:07.619 align:start position:0%
we're thinking along the same lines yeah
 
00:50:11.030 --> 00:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
I would I would myself and I'm not a
 
00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:12.770 align:start position:0%
I would I would myself and I'm not a
lawyer

00:50:12.770 --> 00:50:12.780 align:start position:0%
lawyer
 
00:50:15.109 --> 00:50:15.119 align:start position:0%
uh in engineering we try to think
 
00:50:19.309 --> 00:50:19.319 align:start position:0%
logically too to do yes you do
 
00:50:22.130 --> 00:50:22.140 align:start position:0%
some of my favorite clients
 
00:50:22.140 --> 00:50:24.589 align:start position:0%
some of my favorite clients
uh

00:50:24.589 --> 00:50:24.599 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:50:26.809 --> 00:50:26.819 align:start position:0%
to me an expense is when you've incurred
 
00:50:29.089 --> 00:50:29.099 align:start position:0%
the obligation to pay the money that's
 
00:50:30.770 --> 00:50:30.780 align:start position:0%
really the date of the expense in my
 
00:50:30.780 --> 00:50:32.930 align:start position:0%
really the date of the expense in my
mind

00:50:32.930 --> 00:50:32.940 align:start position:0%
mind
 
00:50:35.089 --> 00:50:35.099 align:start position:0%
again I'm obviously not a financer
 
00:50:37.190 --> 00:50:37.200 align:start position:0%
Finance year
 
00:50:38.809 --> 00:50:38.819 align:start position:0%
but that's maybe an approach that we
 
00:50:42.410 --> 00:50:42.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:47.089 --> 00:50:47.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:47.099 --> 00:50:48.410 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:50:48.410 --> 00:50:48.420 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:50:51.049 --> 00:50:51.059 align:start position:0%
the thought that the
 
00:50:53.390 --> 00:50:53.400 align:start position:0%
election cycle would end
 
00:50:55.849 --> 00:50:55.859 align:start position:0%
at midnight on Election Day
 
00:50:58.670 --> 00:50:58.680 align:start position:0%
in the next cycle then begins
 
00:51:05.210 --> 00:51:05.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:07.730 --> 00:51:07.740 align:start position:0%
okay and uh
 
00:51:07.740 --> 00:51:09.290 align:start position:0%
okay and uh
it

00:51:09.290 --> 00:51:09.300 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:51:11.030 --> 00:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
I'm also looking for things that would
 
00:51:13.549 --> 00:51:13.559 align:start position:0%
uh not just
 
00:51:15.349 --> 00:51:15.359 align:start position:0%
that we could agree on but that we could
 
00:51:15.359 --> 00:51:16.130 align:start position:0%
that we could agree on but that we could
get

00:51:16.130 --> 00:51:16.140 align:start position:0%
get
 
00:51:18.910 --> 00:51:18.920 align:start position:0%
the other
 
00:51:23.510 --> 00:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
394 or 395 representatives to agree on
 
00:51:26.150 --> 00:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
or a majority of them
 
00:51:28.730 --> 00:51:28.740 align:start position:0%
that's right and yeah and and then
 
00:51:31.010 --> 00:51:31.020 align:start position:0%
there's a another chambers of
 
00:51:35.089 --> 00:51:35.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:37.130 --> 00:51:37.140 align:start position:0%
well this is my second year doing it I I
 
00:51:40.490 --> 00:51:40.500 align:start position:0%
will just decide I do think that bills
 
00:51:41.569 --> 00:51:41.579 align:start position:0%
that come through the New Hampshire
 
00:51:44.990 --> 00:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
legislature get thoroughly vetted
 
00:51:47.870 --> 00:51:47.880 align:start position:0%
we look at them in many different ways
 
00:51:50.870 --> 00:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
and I think that's a good thing that's
 
00:51:53.089 --> 00:51:53.099 align:start position:0%
obviously a good thing
 
00:51:54.829 --> 00:51:54.839 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:51:54.839 --> 00:52:01.250 align:start position:0%
all right
okay

00:52:01.250 --> 00:52:01.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:04.609 --> 00:52:04.619 align:start position:0%
and then how
 
00:52:07.430 --> 00:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
like so going through his list
 
00:52:29.450 --> 00:52:29.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:32.450 --> 00:52:32.460 align:start position:0%
okay and then what to do with the
 
00:52:34.790 --> 00:52:34.800 align:start position:0%
Surplus I guess is at the bottom of page
 
00:52:39.170 --> 00:52:39.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:40.970 --> 00:52:40.980 align:start position:0%
it's interesting it's only a political
 
00:52:43.809 --> 00:52:43.819 align:start position:0%
committee it doesn't say or candidate
 
00:52:46.069 --> 00:52:46.079 align:start position:0%
page eight
 
00:52:46.079 --> 00:52:53.900 align:start position:0%
page eight
oh

00:52:53.900 --> 00:52:53.910 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:53.910 --> 00:52:59.329 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:52:59.329 --> 00:52:59.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:02.030 --> 00:53:02.040 align:start position:0%
what was it about that that has your
 
00:53:02.040 --> 00:53:02.930 align:start position:0%
what was it about that that has your
attention

00:53:02.930 --> 00:53:02.940 align:start position:0%
attention
 
00:53:06.410 --> 00:53:06.420 align:start position:0%
what was just the theory that that was
 
00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
in this memo that has some
 
00:53:14.870 --> 00:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
on the next page right goes through
 
00:53:18.890 --> 00:53:18.900 align:start position:0%
different complexities or issues and I
 
00:53:18.900 --> 00:53:20.329 align:start position:0%
different complexities or issues and I
just

00:53:20.329 --> 00:53:20.339 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:53:27.109 --> 00:53:27.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:29.569 --> 00:53:29.579 align:start position:0%
and then if you have an access and you
 
00:53:31.430 --> 00:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
roll it over and you're allowed to roll
 
00:53:33.349 --> 00:53:33.359 align:start position:0%
it over
 
00:53:33.359 --> 00:53:34.069 align:start position:0%
it over
um

00:53:34.069 --> 00:53:34.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:37.609 --> 00:53:37.619 align:start position:0%
how do you attribute that
 
00:53:39.710 --> 00:53:39.720 align:start position:0%
um and do you have to do you have to
 
00:53:41.390 --> 00:53:41.400 align:start position:0%
attribute it
 
00:53:43.970 --> 00:53:43.980 align:start position:0%
so say it's five thousand dollars do you
 
00:53:46.910 --> 00:53:46.920 align:start position:0%
have to look back and say this the money
 
00:53:49.809 --> 00:53:49.819 align:start position:0%
is all co-mingled now so you don't know
 
00:53:53.750 --> 00:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
who gave you that money you don't know
 
00:53:55.790 --> 00:53:55.800 align:start position:0%
where did that 5000 come did it come
 
00:53:57.470 --> 00:53:57.480 align:start position:0%
from several one thousand did it come
 
00:53:58.970 --> 00:53:58.980 align:start position:0%
from you know a number of small
 
00:54:01.490 --> 00:54:01.500 align:start position:0%
donations where did it come from and do
 
00:54:04.430 --> 00:54:04.440 align:start position:0%
you have to attribute it to somebody to
 
00:54:06.710 --> 00:54:06.720 align:start position:0%
figure out what the limits are if you
 
00:54:08.450 --> 00:54:08.460 align:start position:0%
roll it over do you have to attribute it
 
00:54:10.970 --> 00:54:10.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:13.430 --> 00:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
or do you just start with that campaign
 
00:54:14.750 --> 00:54:14.760 align:start position:0%
War chest
 
00:54:16.970 --> 00:54:16.980 align:start position:0%
and not attributed to anybody and that's
 
00:54:19.250 --> 00:54:19.260 align:start position:0%
where you start for the next election I
 
00:54:20.990 --> 00:54:21.000 align:start position:0%
I don't know I but I would think it
 
00:54:22.609 --> 00:54:22.619 align:start position:0%
might be a nightmare trying to figure
 
00:54:24.589 --> 00:54:24.599 align:start position:0%
out where it came from at least I think
 
00:54:26.210 --> 00:54:26.220 align:start position:0%
I don't think it would be for the small
 
00:54:28.309 --> 00:54:28.319 align:start position:0%
campaigns it would be it's not
 
00:54:31.430 --> 00:54:31.440 align:start position:0%
it's not the least bit practical and I'm
 
00:54:34.490 --> 00:54:34.500 align:start position:0%
I was thinking about this one as well
 
00:54:37.730 --> 00:54:37.740 align:start position:0%
and I don't know that
 
00:54:39.890 --> 00:54:39.900 align:start position:0%
there's any purpose to it because the
 
00:54:41.930 --> 00:54:41.940 align:start position:0%
donations the contributions they
 
00:54:44.210 --> 00:54:44.220 align:start position:0%
received in the previous
 
00:54:48.109 --> 00:54:48.119 align:start position:0%
election cycle that
 
00:54:51.470 --> 00:54:51.480 align:start position:0%
we're above the threshold for uh you
 
00:54:53.569 --> 00:54:53.579 align:start position:0%
know reporting the name of the person
 
00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
that's still on record
 
00:54:58.069 --> 00:54:58.079 align:start position:0%
so someone who was particularly
 
00:55:00.890 --> 00:55:00.900 align:start position:0%
concerned and they may and the bigger
 
00:55:02.750 --> 00:55:02.760 align:start position:0%
campaigns especially there
 
00:55:05.089 --> 00:55:05.099 align:start position:0%
could be uh
 
00:55:06.710 --> 00:55:06.720 align:start position:0%
they can trace that back the history
 
00:55:08.450 --> 00:55:08.460 align:start position:0%
doesn't just go away
 
00:55:12.349 --> 00:55:12.359 align:start position:0%
they can see they can look over
 
00:55:15.650 --> 00:55:15.660 align:start position:0%
a number of election Cycles you can look
 
00:55:17.990 --> 00:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
for patterns you can see who were big
 
00:55:20.089 --> 00:55:20.099 align:start position:0%
donors in the past so I'm not sure it's
 
00:55:22.010 --> 00:55:22.020 align:start position:0%
needed because that history is still
 
00:55:23.569 --> 00:55:23.579 align:start position:0%
there of who donated
 
00:55:25.970 --> 00:55:25.980 align:start position:0%
that make yeah
 
00:55:29.109 --> 00:55:29.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:32.569 --> 00:55:32.579 align:start position:0%
the pains I just tried to go back trying
 
00:55:35.150 --> 00:55:35.160 align:start position:0%
to go back I mean would be
 
00:55:36.950 --> 00:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
I don't know what you guys think but I
 
00:55:38.809 --> 00:55:38.819 align:start position:0%
think it would be really hard
 
00:55:41.930 --> 00:55:41.940 align:start position:0%
well I'm talking about the public has
 
00:55:44.150 --> 00:55:44.160 align:start position:0%
access to the records from the previous
 
00:55:47.870 --> 00:55:47.880 align:start position:0%
campaign cycle so that can the the who
 
00:55:49.609 --> 00:55:49.619 align:start position:0%
the donors were that knowledge still
 
00:55:51.950 --> 00:55:51.960 align:start position:0%
exist in an accessible form and then
 
00:55:54.349 --> 00:55:54.359 align:start position:0%
they then just start a clean slate
 
00:55:56.150 --> 00:55:56.160 align:start position:0%
for the next election for the
 
00:55:58.250 --> 00:55:58.260 align:start position:0%
distribution limit
 
00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:00.730 align:start position:0%
yeah I think so yeah
 
00:56:00.730 --> 00:56:05.270 align:start position:0%
yeah I think so yeah
[Music]

00:56:05.270 --> 00:56:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:09.170 --> 00:56:09.180 align:start position:0%
because again those previous records of
 
00:56:11.630 --> 00:56:11.640 align:start position:0%
who were contributing
 
00:56:13.309 --> 00:56:13.319 align:start position:0%
monies we think
 
00:56:16.069 --> 00:56:16.079 align:start position:0%
we we agree surpass the threshold of
 
00:56:19.250 --> 00:56:19.260 align:start position:0%
people should know who did it that still
 
00:56:19.260 --> 00:56:23.329 align:start position:0%
people should know who did it that still
exists

00:56:23.329 --> 00:56:23.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:25.010 --> 00:56:25.020 align:start position:0%
so I don't think we need to split it out
 
00:56:27.530 --> 00:56:27.540 align:start position:0%
plus it's totally impractical there's no
 
00:56:29.210 --> 00:56:29.220 align:start position:0%
particular benefit
 
00:56:31.309 --> 00:56:31.319 align:start position:0%
because the knowledge still exists who
 
00:56:31.319 --> 00:56:40.910 align:start position:0%
because the knowledge still exists who
contributed

00:56:40.910 --> 00:56:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:44.390 --> 00:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
in order to file a final report and is
 
00:56:46.549 --> 00:56:46.559 align:start position:0%
there some reason that we're doing
 
00:56:46.559 --> 00:56:48.710 align:start position:0%
there some reason that we're doing
that

00:56:48.710 --> 00:56:48.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:56:55.910 --> 00:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:59.030 --> 00:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm thinking there's two aspects to
 
00:57:03.470 --> 00:57:03.480 align:start position:0%
the campaign Finance system uh
 
00:57:03.480 --> 00:57:04.910 align:start position:0%
the campaign Finance system uh
reporting

00:57:04.910 --> 00:57:04.920 align:start position:0%
reporting
 
00:57:07.190 --> 00:57:07.200 align:start position:0%
one we've discussed which is
 
00:57:09.950 --> 00:57:09.960 align:start position:0%
trying to make sure that the public has
 
00:57:13.250 --> 00:57:13.260 align:start position:0%
knowledge whether could be undo what we
 
00:57:16.069 --> 00:57:16.079 align:start position:0%
call undue influence
 
00:57:18.230 --> 00:57:18.240 align:start position:0%
another reason I think
 
00:57:20.990 --> 00:57:21.000 align:start position:0%
is also
 
00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:22.309 align:start position:0%
is also
that

00:57:22.309 --> 00:57:22.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:57:24.170 --> 00:57:24.180 align:start position:0%
the fact that a campaign has to account
 
00:57:25.910 --> 00:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
for the funds
 
00:57:30.109 --> 00:57:30.119 align:start position:0%
publicly in reports is protection for
 
00:57:30.119 --> 00:57:32.210 align:start position:0%
publicly in reports is protection for
contributors

00:57:32.210 --> 00:57:32.220 align:start position:0%
contributors
 
00:57:33.890 --> 00:57:33.900 align:start position:0%
I donate
 
00:57:36.650 --> 00:57:36.660 align:start position:0%
right a hundred dollars you know big
 
00:57:39.170 --> 00:57:39.180 align:start position:0%
money you know well for me it would be
 
00:57:43.250 --> 00:57:43.260 align:start position:0%
it would right for all of us I think but
 
00:57:45.170 --> 00:57:45.180 align:start position:0%
it assures
 
00:57:47.569 --> 00:57:47.579 align:start position:0%
the fact you have to zero it out and
 
00:57:49.370 --> 00:57:49.380 align:start position:0%
account for how the money was disposed
 
00:57:52.250 --> 00:57:52.260 align:start position:0%
of for example you can zero it out if
 
00:57:54.349 --> 00:57:54.359 align:start position:0%
you have a surplus and you donate it to
 
00:57:56.510 --> 00:57:56.520 align:start position:0%
another campaign or you donate it I
 
00:57:59.030 --> 00:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
believe to a charity and recognized
 
00:58:02.349 --> 00:58:02.359 align:start position:0%
charity right so the people who
 
00:58:06.349 --> 00:58:06.359 align:start position:0%
uh donated now know the money was used
 
00:58:08.750 --> 00:58:08.760 align:start position:0%
for a proper purpose
 
00:58:10.309 --> 00:58:10.319 align:start position:0%
that they had in mind when they donated
 
00:58:10.319 --> 00:58:11.210 align:start position:0%
that they had in mind when they donated
it

00:58:11.210 --> 00:58:11.220 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:58:13.549 --> 00:58:13.559 align:start position:0%
so in New Hampshire at least right you
 
00:58:15.530 --> 00:58:15.540 align:start position:0%
build up a big campaign War chest you
 
00:58:18.829 --> 00:58:18.839 align:start position:0%
can't go uh you're no longer running for
 
00:58:20.510 --> 00:58:20.520 align:start position:0%
office you can't go spend it on a
 
00:58:22.490 --> 00:58:22.500 align:start position:0%
vacation on a cruise
 
00:58:22.500 --> 00:58:23.630 align:start position:0%
vacation on a cruise
right

00:58:23.630 --> 00:58:23.640 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:58:25.430 --> 00:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
so I think that's the second aspect of
 
00:58:28.069 --> 00:58:28.079 align:start position:0%
it and why it's important to zero it out
 
00:58:29.870 --> 00:58:29.880 align:start position:0%
before you close it
 
00:58:40.609 --> 00:58:40.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:43.789 --> 00:58:43.799 align:start position:0%
you roll it over to that
 
00:58:47.150 --> 00:58:47.160 align:start position:0%
I guess if you decide not to run you'd
 
00:58:49.910 --> 00:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
still have to zero it out you'd have to
 
00:58:51.470 --> 00:58:51.480 align:start position:0%
see right out at that time and one of
 
00:58:51.480 --> 00:58:52.190 align:start position:0%
see right out at that time and one of
the

00:58:52.190 --> 00:58:52.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:58:53.870 --> 00:58:53.880 align:start position:0%
passions Allowed by the law and that's
 
00:58:55.430 --> 00:58:55.440 align:start position:0%
also a protection against corruption
 
00:58:57.230 --> 00:58:57.240 align:start position:0%
exactly that's why I think it's an
 
00:59:00.170 --> 00:59:00.180 align:start position:0%
excellent protection against corruption
 
00:59:02.690 --> 00:59:02.700 align:start position:0%
you can't you can't build up a huge War
 
00:59:04.490 --> 00:59:04.500 align:start position:0%
chest and then I'm not running anymore
 
00:59:05.930 --> 00:59:05.940 align:start position:0%
and spend it however you like which
 
00:59:07.130 --> 00:59:07.140 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:59:07.140 --> 00:59:09.289 align:start position:0%
would be
corrupt

00:59:09.289 --> 00:59:09.299 align:start position:0%
corrupt
 
00:59:12.349 --> 00:59:12.359 align:start position:0%
if the money I'm speaking you know
 
00:59:15.710 --> 00:59:15.720 align:start position:0%
generally and loosely no I agree
 
00:59:18.230 --> 00:59:18.240 align:start position:0%
so that's a good reason for zeroing out
 
00:59:19.370 --> 00:59:19.380 align:start position:0%
a particular
 
00:59:33.970 --> 00:59:33.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:38.270 --> 00:59:38.280 align:start position:0%
yes what's on your mind representative
 
00:59:40.549 --> 00:59:40.559 align:start position:0%
um just looking at the at the
 
00:59:42.410 --> 00:59:42.420 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's
 
00:59:42.420 --> 00:59:43.130 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's
um

00:59:43.130 --> 00:59:43.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:46.549 --> 00:59:46.559 align:start position:0%
list that he shared with us last week
 
00:59:48.710 --> 00:59:48.720 align:start position:0%
um there seemed to be a number like a
 
00:59:51.349 --> 00:59:51.359 align:start position:0%
lot a lot of things that this working
 
00:59:55.010 --> 00:59:55.020 align:start position:0%
group could look into one just taking
 
00:59:57.289 --> 00:59:57.299 align:start position:0%
them in order
 
01:00:00.589 --> 01:00:00.599 align:start position:0%
um that the can a candidate committee is
 
01:00:00.599 --> 01:00:02.990 align:start position:0%
um that the can a candidate committee is
undefined

01:00:02.990 --> 01:00:03.000 align:start position:0%
undefined
 
01:00:06.530 --> 01:00:06.540 align:start position:0%
um and so uh on page one
 
01:00:08.210 --> 01:00:08.220 align:start position:0%
of 11
 
01:00:11.990 --> 01:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
number two a last sentence if retained
 
01:00:13.849 --> 01:00:13.859 align:start position:0%
as a separate type of registration quote
 
01:00:16.549 --> 01:00:16.559 align:start position:0%
candidate committee should be defined so
 
01:00:18.430 --> 01:00:18.440 align:start position:0%
if we want to retain that we should
 
01:00:20.990 --> 01:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
maybe write a definition of it that we
 
01:00:22.549 --> 01:00:22.559 align:start position:0%
could insert into the law
 
01:00:25.490 --> 01:00:25.500 align:start position:0%
two I mean the second thing that I see
 
01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:27.530 align:start position:0%
two I mean the second thing that I see
here

01:00:27.530 --> 01:00:27.540 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:00:27.540 --> 01:00:28.370 align:start position:0%
here
um

01:00:28.370 --> 01:00:28.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:29.930 --> 01:00:29.940 align:start position:0%
there are different reporting
 
01:00:31.370 --> 01:00:31.380 align:start position:0%
requirements for candidate committees
 
01:00:32.510 --> 01:00:32.520 align:start position:0%
and candidates you've already mentioned
 
01:00:34.490 --> 01:00:34.500 align:start position:0%
that candidate committee has to register
 
01:00:37.849 --> 01:00:37.859 align:start position:0%
within 48 Hours of promoting success or
 
01:00:37.859 --> 01:00:40.010 align:start position:0%
within 48 Hours of promoting success or
defeat

01:00:40.010 --> 01:00:40.020 align:start position:0%
defeat
 
01:00:42.650 --> 01:00:42.660 align:start position:0%
um a candidate only has to register when
 
01:00:44.569 --> 01:00:44.579 align:start position:0%
expenses are greater than a thousand
 
01:00:46.250 --> 01:00:46.260 align:start position:0%
dollars right
 
01:00:47.930 --> 01:00:47.940 align:start position:0%
um the two things should be the the
 
01:00:49.430 --> 01:00:49.440 align:start position:0%
reporting requirement should just be the
 
01:00:52.730 --> 01:00:52.740 align:start position:0%
same for these two things probably
 
01:00:55.250 --> 01:00:55.260 align:start position:0%
three third thing
 
01:00:57.670 --> 01:00:57.680 align:start position:0%
on page two of eleven
 
01:01:00.370 --> 01:01:00.380 align:start position:0%
in the discussion of
 
01:01:03.730 --> 01:01:03.740 align:start position:0%
exploratory candidate candidates
 
01:01:05.930 --> 01:01:05.940 align:start position:0%
exploratory candidates do not need to
 
01:01:08.630 --> 01:01:08.640 align:start position:0%
register at all they can raise and spend
 
01:01:11.510 --> 01:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
without limit
 
01:01:15.349 --> 01:01:15.359 align:start position:0%
and the Secretary of State's memo
 
01:01:19.010 --> 01:01:19.020 align:start position:0%
says to us at the bottom of the third
 
01:01:22.670 --> 01:01:22.680 align:start position:0%
paragraph on page two exploratory
 
01:01:28.970 --> 01:01:28.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:28.980 --> 01:01:30.970 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:01:30.970 --> 01:01:30.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:33.109 --> 01:01:33.119 align:start position:0%
exploratory candidates committee should
 
01:01:34.670 --> 01:01:34.680 align:start position:0%
be defined in the reporting obligation
 
01:01:36.589 --> 01:01:36.599 align:start position:0%
should be made explicit last sentence of
 
01:01:37.970 --> 01:01:37.980 align:start position:0%
the third paragraph
 
01:01:40.190 --> 01:01:40.200 align:start position:0%
uh one idea is to well there are
 
01:01:41.329 --> 01:01:41.339 align:start position:0%
different solutions to that but I'm just
 
01:01:43.069 --> 01:01:43.079 align:start position:0%
this is just on the to-do list so I
 
01:01:45.349 --> 01:01:45.359 align:start position:0%
don't I won't segue into Solutions but
 
01:01:49.370 --> 01:01:49.380 align:start position:0%
but the third item on the to-do list
 
01:01:52.789 --> 01:01:52.799 align:start position:0%
um fourth item
 
01:01:52.799 --> 01:01:54.230 align:start position:0%
um fourth item
um

01:01:54.230 --> 01:01:54.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:56.390 --> 01:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
turning to the
 
01:01:59.150 --> 01:01:59.160 align:start position:0%
next page three of eleven number five
 
01:02:01.130 --> 01:02:01.140 align:start position:0%
political committee major purpose and
 
01:02:01.140 --> 01:02:02.990 align:start position:0%
political committee major purpose and
electioneering

01:02:02.990 --> 01:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
electioneering
 
01:02:05.289 --> 01:02:05.299 align:start position:0%
there's a twenty five hundred dollar
 
01:02:07.370 --> 01:02:07.380 align:start position:0%
trigger here
 
01:02:09.650 --> 01:02:09.660 align:start position:0%
receipts or expenditures totaling twenty
 
01:02:11.390 --> 01:02:11.400 align:start position:0%
five hundred dollars I think there's an
 
01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:12.589 align:start position:0%
five hundred dollars I think there's an
ambiguity

01:02:12.589 --> 01:02:12.599 align:start position:0%
ambiguity
 
01:02:15.890 --> 01:02:15.900 align:start position:0%
because the candidate committee has a
 
01:02:17.990 --> 01:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar
 
01:02:19.549 --> 01:02:19.559 align:start position:0%
and the candidate has a thousand dollar
 
01:02:19.559 --> 01:02:20.750 align:start position:0%
and the candidate has a thousand dollar
trigger

01:02:20.750 --> 01:02:20.760 align:start position:0%
trigger
 
01:02:22.910 --> 01:02:22.920 align:start position:0%
so we have just a different number here
 
01:02:24.650 --> 01:02:24.660 align:start position:0%
without getting into the question what
 
01:02:27.109 --> 01:02:27.119 align:start position:0%
the number should be just we might want
 
01:02:27.119 --> 01:02:28.089 align:start position:0%
the number should be just we might want
to

01:02:28.089 --> 01:02:28.099 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:02:30.410 --> 01:02:30.420 align:start position:0%
settle our it'd be good if there were
 
01:02:31.970 --> 01:02:31.980 align:start position:0%
consensus that the numbers should be
 
01:02:33.829 --> 01:02:33.839 align:start position:0%
different if they are different
 
01:02:36.170 --> 01:02:36.180 align:start position:0%
or or would ideally be the same whatever
 
01:02:38.690 --> 01:02:38.700 align:start position:0%
the same number is
 
01:02:38.700 --> 01:02:42.410 align:start position:0%
the same number is
um

01:02:42.410 --> 01:02:42.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:44.210 --> 01:02:44.220 align:start position:0%
there's this Distinction on page three
 
01:02:46.130 --> 01:02:46.140 align:start position:0%
between these two types major purpose
 
01:02:47.750 --> 01:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
electioneering major purpose not
 
01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:50.270 align:start position:0%
electioneering major purpose not
electioneering

01:02:50.270 --> 01:02:50.280 align:start position:0%
electioneering
 
01:02:51.890 --> 01:02:51.900 align:start position:0%
um whether it's not electioneering that
 
01:02:54.770 --> 01:02:54.780 align:start position:0%
that the threshold is five thousand
 
01:02:57.470 --> 01:02:57.480 align:start position:0%
dollars in a calendar year
 
01:02:57.480 --> 01:02:58.430 align:start position:0%
dollars in a calendar year
um

01:02:58.430 --> 01:02:58.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:01.130 --> 01:03:01.140 align:start position:0%
and so again you have a different number
 
01:03:03.109 --> 01:03:03.119 align:start position:0%
and it's not and I guess there's no
 
01:03:04.849 --> 01:03:04.859 align:start position:0%
definition in the law of
 
01:03:12.230 --> 01:03:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:15.950 --> 01:03:15.960 align:start position:0%
okay next to do list from this uh page
 
01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:17.150 align:start position:0%
okay next to do list from this uh page
four

01:03:17.150 --> 01:03:17.160 align:start position:0%
four
 
01:03:20.329 --> 01:03:20.339 align:start position:0%
of 11 item nine political advocacy
 
01:03:23.690 --> 01:03:23.700 align:start position:0%
organizations to be discussed
 
01:03:26.690 --> 01:03:26.700 align:start position:0%
um I think that there's a
 
01:03:26.700 --> 01:03:29.329 align:start position:0%
um I think that there's a
um

01:03:29.329 --> 01:03:29.339 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:32.329 --> 01:03:32.339 align:start position:0%
need to clarify this category if we wish
 
01:03:35.809 --> 01:03:35.819 align:start position:0%
to keep it and there are further
 
01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:44.089 --> 01:03:44.099 align:start position:0%
items seven and eight on political
 
01:03:46.549 --> 01:03:46.559 align:start position:0%
advocacy or organization where the memo
 
01:03:52.430 --> 01:03:52.440 align:start position:0%
directs us to RSA 6642 section 22.
 
01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:53.930 align:start position:0%
directs us to RSA 6642 section 22.
um

01:03:53.930 --> 01:03:53.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:55.849 --> 01:03:55.859 align:start position:0%
and they're and they're just ambiguities
 
01:03:58.549 --> 01:03:58.559 align:start position:0%
there in this category one in this one
 
01:04:00.289 --> 01:04:00.299 align:start position:0%
of eight categories political advocacy
 
01:04:02.690 --> 01:04:02.700 align:start position:0%
organization so
 
01:04:04.670 --> 01:04:04.680 align:start position:0%
um again it has a five thousand dollar
 
01:04:07.130 --> 01:04:07.140 align:start position:0%
trigger maybe we just need to sort out
 
01:04:08.870 --> 01:04:08.880 align:start position:0%
do we want this to be in the law this
 
01:04:11.329 --> 01:04:11.339 align:start position:0%
this category and is it what you know be
 
01:04:14.390 --> 01:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
good to know what purpose it's serving
 
01:04:17.569 --> 01:04:17.579 align:start position:0%
um The Entity of political advocacy
 
01:04:21.410 --> 01:04:21.420 align:start position:0%
organization yeah yeah that that
 
01:04:23.510 --> 01:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
that's the kind of thing that when I
 
01:04:24.710 --> 01:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
read that
 
01:04:28.069 --> 01:04:28.079 align:start position:0%
I feel kind of wary of because I think
 
01:04:31.789 --> 01:04:31.799 align:start position:0%
we're all very uh
 
01:04:34.549 --> 01:04:34.559 align:start position:0%
adamant about the Free Speech rights
 
01:04:37.069 --> 01:04:37.079 align:start position:0%
protected by the First Amendment and
 
01:04:39.710 --> 01:04:39.720 align:start position:0%
something sometimes my antenna I just
 
01:04:42.530 --> 01:04:42.540 align:start position:0%
start to quiver about whether we're
 
01:04:44.809 --> 01:04:44.819 align:start position:0%
verging on that like like a political
 
01:04:47.150 --> 01:04:47.160 align:start position:0%
advocacy advocacy organization we've got
 
01:04:48.470 --> 01:04:48.480 align:start position:0%
a right to say whatever we want about
 
01:04:50.569 --> 01:04:50.579 align:start position:0%
political matters too and we have a
 
01:04:52.130 --> 01:04:52.140 align:start position:0%
right to associate with other people to
 
01:04:53.450 --> 01:04:53.460 align:start position:0%
do that
 
01:04:56.750 --> 01:04:56.760 align:start position:0%
so so we should so we should read the go
 
01:04:59.569 --> 01:04:59.579 align:start position:0%
back to that 6642 section 22 with the
 
01:05:01.849 --> 01:05:01.859 align:start position:0%
real what what the Secretary of State's
 
01:05:07.069 --> 01:05:07.079 align:start position:0%
memo speculates on page 10 number seven
 
01:05:08.990 --> 01:05:09.000 align:start position:0%
um you know this I'll just read that to
 
01:05:11.210 --> 01:05:11.220 align:start position:0%
you definition of political advocac
 
01:05:12.890 --> 01:05:12.900 align:start position:0%
story yeah I think it's the organization
 
01:05:16.069 --> 01:05:16.079 align:start position:0%
is not easily understood I think that
 
01:05:18.470 --> 01:05:18.480 align:start position:0%
might be an understatement one
 
01:05:20.030 --> 01:05:20.040 align:start position:0%
reasonable construction of the
 
01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:21.349 align:start position:0%
reasonable construction of the
definition

01:05:21.349 --> 01:05:21.359 align:start position:0%
definition
 
01:05:23.809 --> 01:05:23.819 align:start position:0%
what page are you reading from oh page
 
01:05:26.329 --> 01:05:26.339 align:start position:0%
11 page 10 sorry what
 
01:05:29.030 --> 01:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
um item number seven on page ten ah okay
 
01:05:30.950 --> 01:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
thank you which just directs it's a
 
01:05:32.150 --> 01:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
continuation of this discussion
 
01:05:34.010 --> 01:05:34.020 align:start position:0%
political advocacy organization but it
 
01:05:36.530 --> 01:05:36.540 align:start position:0%
directs us to the put parts of the RSA
 
01:05:38.750 --> 01:05:38.760 align:start position:0%
where they're not defined oh right you
 
01:05:40.789 --> 01:05:40.799 align:start position:0%
can one reasonable construction is that
 
01:05:42.770 --> 01:05:42.780 align:start position:0%
a registered can is this is kind of a
 
01:05:44.750 --> 01:05:44.760 align:start position:0%
catch-all thing if the other seven
 
01:05:46.490 --> 01:05:46.500 align:start position:0%
things didn't catch you this one is
 
01:05:48.890 --> 01:05:48.900 align:start position:0%
there to catch you so it's it's a
 
01:05:51.710 --> 01:05:51.720 align:start position:0%
registered can can choose this only if
 
01:05:54.349 --> 01:05:54.359 align:start position:0%
you don't qualify as any of the other
 
01:05:56.450 --> 01:05:56.460 align:start position:0%
types of registration
 
01:05:59.150 --> 01:05:59.160 align:start position:0%
so so maybe that's what the purpose is
 
01:06:00.650 --> 01:06:00.660 align:start position:0%
I'm just speculating here but anyway it
 
01:06:02.510 --> 01:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
seems like we have some defining to do
 
01:06:04.670 --> 01:06:04.680 align:start position:0%
if we want to keep that
 
01:06:05.809 --> 01:06:05.819 align:start position:0%
um yeah there was a there was another
 
01:06:09.650 --> 01:06:09.660 align:start position:0%
political committee type on page four
 
01:06:12.890 --> 01:06:12.900 align:start position:0%
item seven political committee voluntary
 
01:06:12.900 --> 01:06:15.230 align:start position:0%
item seven political committee voluntary
registration

01:06:15.230 --> 01:06:15.240 align:start position:0%
registration
 
01:06:17.750 --> 01:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:06:22.609 --> 01:06:22.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:23.809 --> 01:06:23.819 align:start position:0%
yeah they don't have well they don't
 
01:06:25.789 --> 01:06:25.799 align:start position:0%
have to report but they don't
 
01:06:28.309 --> 01:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
first I understand what it is but why do
 
01:06:31.549 --> 01:06:31.559 align:start position:0%
we need that so so there are these other
 
01:06:33.470 --> 01:06:33.480 align:start position:0%
um I don't know that we do back well
 
01:06:36.049 --> 01:06:36.059 align:start position:0%
back later in the memo yeah
 
01:06:39.109 --> 01:06:39.119 align:start position:0%
um there are these cases where people
 
01:06:41.569 --> 01:06:41.579 align:start position:0%
entities or people register though
 
01:06:43.069 --> 01:06:43.079 align:start position:0%
they're not required to sometimes
 
01:06:45.470 --> 01:06:45.480 align:start position:0%
because they're receiving a contribution
 
01:06:47.329 --> 01:06:47.339 align:start position:0%
and the contributor wants to know that
 
01:06:48.770 --> 01:06:48.780 align:start position:0%
the contribution has been received and
 
01:06:51.650 --> 01:06:51.660 align:start position:0%
registered well I I know I read that
 
01:06:55.130 --> 01:06:55.140 align:start position:0%
okay and I understand it but
 
01:06:56.690 --> 01:06:56.700 align:start position:0%
I don't know how to put this nicely is
 
01:06:58.970 --> 01:06:58.980 align:start position:0%
that really our problem that we need to
 
01:07:00.589 --> 01:07:00.599 align:start position:0%
address in the law I don't know I don't
 
01:07:02.210 --> 01:07:02.220 align:start position:0%
know I don't have a real opinion on it
 
01:07:03.950 --> 01:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
it's a question yeah good it's a really
 
01:07:05.270 --> 01:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
good question maybe the system could
 
01:07:06.410 --> 01:07:06.420 align:start position:0%
allow people to do it without it being
 
01:07:07.970 --> 01:07:07.980 align:start position:0%
in the RSA
 
01:07:10.309 --> 01:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
the next thing on the to-do list is that
 
01:07:12.470 --> 01:07:12.480 align:start position:0%
Fiscal Agent fiscal
 
01:07:15.950 --> 01:07:15.960 align:start position:0%
oh right versus Financial agent Fiscal
 
01:07:20.470 --> 01:07:20.480 align:start position:0%
Agent and Treasurer yeah and 664-12
 
01:07:22.849 --> 01:07:22.859 align:start position:0%
6647 they they're we have different
 
01:07:27.170 --> 01:07:27.180 align:start position:0%
terms floating around 664 3 and 13.
 
01:07:29.089 --> 01:07:29.099 align:start position:0%
um and uh
 
01:07:31.549 --> 01:07:31.559 align:start position:0%
secretary of state reports on page six
 
01:07:33.529 --> 01:07:33.539 align:start position:0%
of the memo we receive questions on the
 
01:07:35.510 --> 01:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
distinction between Financial agent
 
01:07:37.910 --> 01:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
Fiscal Agent Treasurer clarifying these
 
01:07:40.849 --> 01:07:40.859 align:start position:0%
roles in any intended distinction would
 
01:07:42.650 --> 01:07:42.660 align:start position:0%
be beneficial if there's no meaningful
 
01:07:42.660 --> 01:07:43.670 align:start position:0%
be beneficial if there's no meaningful
distinction

01:07:43.670 --> 01:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
distinction
 
01:07:47.270 --> 01:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
you might not use a single term so
 
01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:47.870 align:start position:0%
you might not use a single term so
um

01:07:47.870 --> 01:07:47.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:47.880 --> 01:07:48.950 align:start position:0%
um
yep

01:07:48.950 --> 01:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
yep
 
01:07:51.890 --> 01:07:51.900 align:start position:0%
the there's another next item on the to
 
01:07:54.650 --> 01:07:54.660 align:start position:0%
do so the eighth item on my list of the
 
01:07:56.990 --> 01:07:57.000 align:start position:0%
to Do's in this memo
 
01:08:00.650 --> 01:08:00.660 align:start position:0%
um arises on page eight of the memo
 
01:08:00.660 --> 01:08:01.430 align:start position:0%
um arises on page eight of the memo
um

01:08:01.430 --> 01:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:05.510 --> 01:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
where uh the reporting requirements
 
01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:07.309 align:start position:0%
where uh the reporting requirements
for

01:08:07.309 --> 01:08:07.319 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:08:07.319 --> 01:08:09.289 align:start position:0%
for
um

01:08:09.289 --> 01:08:09.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:14.569 --> 01:08:14.579 align:start position:0%
reporting deadlines are being discussed
 
01:08:14.579 --> 01:08:15.349 align:start position:0%
reporting deadlines are being discussed
um

01:08:15.349 --> 01:08:15.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:15.359 --> 01:08:17.150 align:start position:0%
um
and

01:08:17.150 --> 01:08:17.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:08:20.390 --> 01:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
and there's a question about the
 
01:08:22.550 --> 01:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
reporting requirements
 
01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:30.110 align:start position:0%
reporting requirements
um

01:08:30.110 --> 01:08:30.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:33.110 --> 01:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
for for political committees
 
01:08:34.809 --> 01:08:34.819 align:start position:0%
that doesn't that don't have
 
01:08:37.490 --> 01:08:37.500 align:start position:0%
contributions or or receipts in excess
 
01:08:39.890 --> 01:08:39.900 align:start position:0%
of a thousand dollars
 
01:08:39.900 --> 01:08:42.410 align:start position:0%
of a thousand dollars
um

01:08:42.410 --> 01:08:42.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:44.630 --> 01:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
but that's on page eight
 
01:08:46.849 --> 01:08:46.859 align:start position:0%
yeah page eight at the end of the first
 
01:08:48.470 --> 01:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
paragraph some filers find the
 
01:08:50.510 --> 01:08:50.520 align:start position:0%
requirement and process for the zero
 
01:08:53.390 --> 01:08:53.400 align:start position:0%
receipt expenditure reports confusing
 
01:08:55.729 --> 01:08:55.739 align:start position:0%
just just of note so if we want that to
 
01:08:57.349 --> 01:08:57.359 align:start position:0%
be confusing we want the law to be
 
01:08:59.269 --> 01:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
confusing we should keep it as it is
 
01:09:02.990 --> 01:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
maybe if we want to fix that
 
01:09:04.669 --> 01:09:04.679 align:start position:0%
um then there's the next paragraph
 
01:09:06.530 --> 01:09:06.540 align:start position:0%
there's a way in which committees are
 
01:09:08.930 --> 01:09:08.940 align:start position:0%
reporting twice so the end of that
 
01:09:10.910 --> 01:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
paragraph says record reporting twice is
 
01:09:13.010 --> 01:09:13.020 align:start position:0%
the current practice in order to comply
 
01:09:15.169 --> 01:09:15.179 align:start position:0%
at the loss so probably you don't really
 
01:09:16.910 --> 01:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
need to make people report you know the
 
01:09:18.110 --> 01:09:18.120 align:start position:0%
intention isn't to make them report
 
01:09:20.749 --> 01:09:20.759 align:start position:0%
twice I had the same question in my
 
01:09:24.229 --> 01:09:24.239 align:start position:0%
notes yeah so that's a mop up area
 
01:09:29.450 --> 01:09:29.460 align:start position:0%
um and page nine it looks like on item
 
01:09:31.610 --> 01:09:31.620 align:start position:0%
4A at the top
 
01:09:31.620 --> 01:09:33.169 align:start position:0%
4A at the top
um

01:09:33.169 --> 01:09:33.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:35.030 --> 01:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
this has to do with closing I think
 
01:09:38.030 --> 01:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
closing out a political committee
 
01:09:41.390 --> 01:09:41.400 align:start position:0%
um this this item a
 
01:09:45.950 --> 01:09:45.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:47.689 align:start position:0%
 
right

01:09:47.689 --> 01:09:47.699 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:09:52.189 --> 01:09:52.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:54.770 --> 01:09:54.780 align:start position:0%
so yeah it says the plain language would
 
01:09:56.090 --> 01:09:56.100 align:start position:0%
mean that even though they've never had
 
01:09:58.310 --> 01:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
to report right the deadlines leading up
 
01:10:00.410 --> 01:10:00.420 align:start position:0%
to and following the election they would
 
01:10:01.850 --> 01:10:01.860 align:start position:0%
nonetheless have to file a report
 
01:10:04.550 --> 01:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
disposing all receipts and expenditures
 
01:10:06.530 --> 01:10:06.540 align:start position:0%
to close the committee right because
 
01:10:08.510 --> 01:10:08.520 align:start position:0%
they exist as a committee even though
 
01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:09.290 align:start position:0%
they exist as a committee even though
they

01:10:09.290 --> 01:10:09.300 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:10:11.870 --> 01:10:11.880 align:start position:0%
under another definition yes it's a
 
01:10:13.370 --> 01:10:13.380 align:start position:0%
small thing but it's a source of
 
01:10:15.709 --> 01:10:15.719 align:start position:0%
complete confusion and then finally the
 
01:10:18.110 --> 01:10:18.120 align:start position:0%
last to do thing is raising funds after
 
01:10:20.630 --> 01:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
a cycle if there's no debt in the
 
01:10:22.490 --> 01:10:22.500 align:start position:0%
campaign and the Secretary of State's
 
01:10:25.790 --> 01:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
memo on page nine down
 
01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:28.250 align:start position:0%
memo on page nine down
um

01:10:28.250 --> 01:10:28.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:30.649 --> 01:10:30.659 align:start position:0%
on letter d
 
01:10:34.669 --> 01:10:34.679 align:start position:0%
asks that we make more explicit the
 
01:10:36.350 --> 01:10:36.360 align:start position:0%
prohibition against post-election
 
01:10:38.990 --> 01:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
fundraising and campaigns we were just
 
01:10:41.209 --> 01:10:41.219 align:start position:0%
discussing that a while ago which
 
01:10:44.090 --> 01:10:44.100 align:start position:0%
those are just that's my list for as for
 
01:10:46.490 --> 01:10:46.500 align:start position:0%
what's on my mind of the to Do's that
 
01:10:48.950 --> 01:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
come out of this memo none of which I
 
01:10:51.470 --> 01:10:51.480 align:start position:0%
think necessarily involve
 
01:10:55.430 --> 01:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
you know essentially contested
 
01:10:58.430 --> 01:10:58.440 align:start position:0%
um ideas and Concepts and philosophies
 
01:11:00.530 --> 01:11:00.540 align:start position:0%
is that something you would be willing
 
01:11:02.689 --> 01:11:02.699 align:start position:0%
to take a few minutes and type up as a
 
01:11:04.669 --> 01:11:04.679 align:start position:0%
working as a working document yeah I'll
 
01:11:09.950 --> 01:11:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:12.830 --> 01:11:12.840 align:start position:0%
who's who's maintaining like
 
01:11:15.350 --> 01:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
writing all of these do we just start
 
01:11:17.930 --> 01:11:17.940 align:start position:0%
having a working document and then
 
01:11:20.510 --> 01:11:20.520 align:start position:0%
insert stuff for
 
01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:22.250 align:start position:0%
insert stuff for
but

01:11:22.250 --> 01:11:22.260 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:11:24.110 --> 01:11:24.120 align:start position:0%
I started doing it only because that's
 
01:11:25.850 --> 01:11:25.860 align:start position:0%
how I think well that's all I think I
 
01:11:27.169 --> 01:11:27.179 align:start position:0%
just hadn't got to it yet yeah I mean
 
01:11:29.450 --> 01:11:29.460 align:start position:0%
I've made my notes on okay on the
 
01:11:31.850 --> 01:11:31.860 align:start position:0%
write-up I think I mean I will make a
 
01:11:34.610 --> 01:11:34.620 align:start position:0%
similar list myself I need to
 
01:11:37.490 --> 01:11:37.500 align:start position:0%
so I can think about it okay uh I think
 
01:11:39.770 --> 01:11:39.780 align:start position:0%
we can I think we can share these These
 
01:11:43.250 --> 01:11:43.260 align:start position:0%
are this is not an actual document in
 
01:11:45.229 --> 01:11:45.239 align:start position:0%
the public sense because it's not it's
 
01:11:47.149 --> 01:11:47.159 align:start position:0%
just notes
 
01:11:49.910 --> 01:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
01:11:51.950 --> 01:11:51.960 align:start position:0%
and I'm and as I look ahead there's a
 
01:11:53.630 --> 01:11:53.640 align:start position:0%
lot there and and some of those things
 
01:11:55.070 --> 01:11:55.080 align:start position:0%
are very very
 
01:11:58.130 --> 01:11:58.140 align:start position:0%
uh require a lot of concentration study
 
01:12:00.229 --> 01:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
and maybe this committee picks out
 
01:12:03.110 --> 01:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
you know two or three of them and tries
 
01:12:06.169 --> 01:12:06.179 align:start position:0%
to do on the on the idea that fixing
 
01:12:07.669 --> 01:12:07.679 align:start position:0%
something is better than fixing nothing
 
01:12:10.010 --> 01:12:10.020 align:start position:0%
even if we can't fix everything
 
01:12:11.870 --> 01:12:11.880 align:start position:0%
well what's that saying progress not
 
01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:13.010 align:start position:0%
well what's that saying progress not
perfection

01:12:13.010 --> 01:12:13.020 align:start position:0%
perfection
 
01:12:17.050 --> 01:12:17.060 align:start position:0%
right I mean make things better
 
01:12:20.810 --> 01:12:20.820 align:start position:0%
well in our that implies in our opinion
 
01:12:22.850 --> 01:12:22.860 align:start position:0%
of course it would have to be an opinion
 
01:12:25.550 --> 01:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
shared by a majority of
 
01:12:27.770 --> 01:12:27.780 align:start position:0%
two legislative Chambers too to go
 
01:12:27.780 --> 01:12:29.330 align:start position:0%
two legislative Chambers too to go
anywhere

01:12:29.330 --> 01:12:29.340 align:start position:0%
anywhere
 
01:12:29.340 --> 01:12:31.130 align:start position:0%
anywhere
so

01:12:31.130 --> 01:12:31.140 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:12:34.250 --> 01:12:34.260 align:start position:0%
yeah that's that's what I was thinking
 
01:12:35.990 --> 01:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
when I read through this and considering
 
01:12:38.750 --> 01:12:38.760 align:start position:0%
the policy matters that
 
01:12:43.010 --> 01:12:43.020 align:start position:0%
that we could also discuss
 
01:12:46.430 --> 01:12:46.440 align:start position:0%
yeah as far as yeah I don't know that
 
01:12:48.169 --> 01:12:48.179 align:start position:0%
we're under
 
01:12:50.149 --> 01:12:50.159 align:start position:0%
I think there's a natural deadline for
 
01:12:52.189 --> 01:12:52.199 align:start position:0%
what we're doing here not a natural
 
01:12:52.199 --> 01:12:53.810 align:start position:0%
what we're doing here not a natural
schedule

01:12:53.810 --> 01:12:53.820 align:start position:0%
schedule
 
01:12:56.990 --> 01:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
uh what's the date by which legislation
 
01:12:59.030 --> 01:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
would have to be filed for next year I
 
01:13:01.070 --> 01:13:01.080 align:start position:0%
don't remember since December
 
01:13:03.169 --> 01:13:03.179 align:start position:0%
does it
 
01:13:05.270 --> 01:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
right about later September oh it is
 
01:13:08.330 --> 01:13:08.340 align:start position:0%
that soon okay I thought it was later I
 
01:13:20.149 --> 01:13:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:24.890 --> 01:13:24.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:29.630 --> 01:13:29.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:31.790 --> 01:13:31.800 align:start position:0%
I'm glad I'm glad we have you guys here
 
01:13:33.790 --> 01:13:33.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:13:37.370 --> 01:13:37.380 align:start position:0%
wow that's that's soon
 
01:13:37.380 --> 01:13:38.750 align:start position:0%
wow that's that's soon
yeah

01:13:38.750 --> 01:13:38.760 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:13:40.930 --> 01:13:40.940 align:start position:0%
I just don't have it with me
 
01:13:43.610 --> 01:13:43.620 align:start position:0%
recommended legislation of Canada to the
 
01:13:43.620 --> 01:13:46.510 align:start position:0%
recommended legislation of Canada to the
next

01:13:46.510 --> 01:13:46.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:50.390 --> 01:13:50.400 align:start position:0%
I mean that would still be good work you
 
01:13:53.090 --> 01:13:53.100 align:start position:0%
don't have to necessarily get the same
 
01:13:55.850 --> 01:13:55.860 align:start position:0%
well actually if we wanted if we got to
 
01:13:58.610 --> 01:13:58.620 align:start position:0%
the point where we had
 
01:14:01.010 --> 01:14:01.020 align:start position:0%
Notions that we thought were ready to
 
01:14:03.169 --> 01:14:03.179 align:start position:0%
introduce his legislation that would be
 
01:14:07.130 --> 01:14:07.140 align:start position:0%
the schedule but we still can produce a
 
01:14:09.110 --> 01:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
useful work product in the form of a
 
01:14:11.510 --> 01:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
report right laying out more
 
01:14:14.270 --> 01:14:14.280 align:start position:0%
recommendations than that yeah and the
 
01:14:16.430 --> 01:14:16.440 align:start position:0%
reasons you know and supporting
 
01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:18.350 align:start position:0%
reasons you know and supporting
uh

01:14:18.350 --> 01:14:18.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:14:20.450 --> 01:14:20.460 align:start position:0%
material to support why we think that of
 
01:14:20.460 --> 01:14:22.430 align:start position:0%
material to support why we think that of
course

01:14:22.430 --> 01:14:22.440 align:start position:0%
course
 
01:14:25.850 --> 01:14:25.860 align:start position:0%
and the deputy secretary of state raised
 
01:14:28.070 --> 01:14:28.080 align:start position:0%
her hand with a con I think she might
 
01:14:29.870 --> 01:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
have a comment
 
01:14:32.990 --> 01:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
we would welcome your comment Deputy a
 
01:14:36.890 --> 01:14:36.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:38.510 --> 01:14:38.520 align:start position:0%
would you like to come up to the
 
01:14:41.450 --> 01:14:41.460 align:start position:0%
microphone just so we can all hear
 
01:14:41.460 --> 01:14:46.130 align:start position:0%
microphone just so we can all hear
okay

01:14:46.130 --> 01:14:46.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:47.810 --> 01:14:47.820 align:start position:0%
Aaron Hennessey deputy secretary of
 
01:14:50.030 --> 01:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
state this is just a tip trick from my
 
01:14:52.130 --> 01:14:52.140 align:start position:0%
old legislative days if not as my
 
01:14:54.410 --> 01:14:54.420 align:start position:0%
current role but if there are things
 
01:14:56.270 --> 01:14:56.280 align:start position:0%
that you know you want to change you
 
01:14:58.729 --> 01:14:58.739 align:start position:0%
could put a bill in September and if you
 
01:15:01.070 --> 01:15:01.080 align:start position:0%
want to continue working you could amend
 
01:15:03.709 --> 01:15:03.719 align:start position:0%
that bill that's what I was wondering
 
01:15:08.030 --> 01:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:11.890 --> 01:15:11.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:22.010 --> 01:15:22.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:24.729 --> 01:15:24.739 align:start position:0%
well um
 
01:15:27.229 --> 01:15:27.239 align:start position:0%
right I'm still thinking we can come up
 
01:15:30.110 --> 01:15:30.120 align:start position:0%
with at least a list of topics that
 
01:15:33.530 --> 01:15:33.540 align:start position:0%
would improve the current state of the
 
01:15:35.209 --> 01:15:35.219 align:start position:0%
statutes it would be helpful to people
 
01:15:41.209 --> 01:15:41.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:44.750 --> 01:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
at the end of this year or would it
 
01:15:46.970 --> 01:15:46.980 align:start position:0%
continue then we could continue on and
 
01:15:49.729 --> 01:15:49.739 align:start position:0%
put in that amendment I don't know
 
01:15:52.010 --> 01:15:52.020 align:start position:0%
we can find out though I don't recall
 
01:15:54.470 --> 01:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
that it was an end date included in the
 
01:15:57.290 --> 01:15:57.300 align:start position:0%
notice of the subcommittee yeah I don't
 
01:15:58.970 --> 01:15:58.980 align:start position:0%
know if there was a yeah I don't know if
 
01:16:06.890 --> 01:16:06.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:08.570 --> 01:16:08.580 align:start position:0%
and I don't know when they appointed the
 
01:16:10.790 --> 01:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
subcommittee they had that same date so
 
01:16:13.550 --> 01:16:13.560 align:start position:0%
I guess we can clarify that
 
01:16:16.490 --> 01:16:16.500 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah there may well be a rule on
 
01:16:18.229 --> 01:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
that I don't know what okay we can find
 
01:16:19.970 --> 01:16:19.980 align:start position:0%
out though
 
01:16:22.310 --> 01:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
all right let me make a note on that
 
01:16:44.149 --> 01:16:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:46.850 --> 01:16:46.860 align:start position:0%
does this subcommittee have a defined
 
01:16:50.630 --> 01:16:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:00.290 --> 01:17:00.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:03.770 --> 01:17:03.780 align:start position:0%
yeah that that another
 
01:17:06.470 --> 01:17:06.480 align:start position:0%
area on my mind has to do with
 
01:17:08.570 --> 01:17:08.580 align:start position:0%
exploratory committees and the
 
01:17:13.550 --> 01:17:13.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:16.850 --> 01:17:16.860 align:start position:0%
that implies a certain formality but
 
01:17:19.430 --> 01:17:19.440 align:start position:0%
anybody can consider whether they want
 
01:17:21.490 --> 01:17:21.500 align:start position:0%
to run for office ahead of the filing
 
01:17:24.290 --> 01:17:24.300 align:start position:0%
period and they can talk to people about
 
01:17:24.300 --> 01:17:25.570 align:start position:0%
period and they can talk to people about
it

01:17:25.570 --> 01:17:25.580 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:17:30.410 --> 01:17:30.420 align:start position:0%
and people can promote their own ideas
 
01:17:32.570 --> 01:17:32.580 align:start position:0%
through media you know paid media even
 
01:17:35.450 --> 01:17:35.460 align:start position:0%
without having to ask permission
 
01:17:35.460 --> 01:17:38.630 align:start position:0%
without having to ask permission
so

01:17:38.630 --> 01:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:41.570 --> 01:17:41.580 align:start position:0%
it doesn't sound like we have a
 
01:17:44.930 --> 01:17:44.940 align:start position:0%
definition of exploratory candidate do
 
01:17:44.940 --> 01:17:47.450 align:start position:0%
definition of exploratory candidate do
we

01:17:47.450 --> 01:17:47.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:50.810 --> 01:17:50.820 align:start position:0%
I mean it's not in there it would have
 
01:17:53.630 --> 01:17:53.640 align:start position:0%
to be one that wouldn't be used but it's
 
01:17:55.790 --> 01:17:55.800 align:start position:0%
clearly defining and if there were one
 
01:17:57.290 --> 01:17:57.300 align:start position:0%
that would have would have to be sure it
 
01:17:58.790 --> 01:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't step on people's Free Speech
 
01:17:58.800 --> 01:18:06.050 align:start position:0%
doesn't step on people's Free Speech
rights

01:18:06.050 --> 01:18:06.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:08.930 --> 01:18:08.940 align:start position:0%
for the entire election cycle yep it's
 
01:18:19.189 --> 01:18:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:21.770 --> 01:18:21.780 align:start position:0%
but we would have to Define when you
 
01:18:23.270 --> 01:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
become a candidate
 
01:18:25.189 --> 01:18:25.199 align:start position:0%
which we have to do anyway which is
 
01:18:27.830 --> 01:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
defined for they wanted us to Define
 
01:18:30.890 --> 01:18:30.900 align:start position:0%
when when you become a candidate so I'll
 
01:18:33.110 --> 01:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
I'll take that on but when you do but
 
01:18:35.030 --> 01:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
when do you start running and the
 
01:18:37.189 --> 01:18:37.199 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State suggested the date
 
01:18:38.630 --> 01:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
that you file
 
01:18:41.330 --> 01:18:41.340 align:start position:0%
that that's in June and you probably
 
01:18:43.729 --> 01:18:43.739 align:start position:0%
already been collecting money and
 
01:18:45.530 --> 01:18:45.540 align:start position:0%
campaigning and doing stuff particularly
 
01:18:48.169 --> 01:18:48.179 align:start position:0%
for the larger offices well before the
 
01:18:51.290 --> 01:18:51.300 align:start position:0%
date that you file sure so I'm not sure
 
01:18:54.169 --> 01:18:54.179 align:start position:0%
that that date is really capturing what
 
01:18:55.310 --> 01:18:55.320 align:start position:0%
we want to know
 
01:18:58.790 --> 01:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
so if so I think but it would be in an
 
01:19:00.530 --> 01:19:00.540 align:start position:0%
election cycle so it would catch it if
 
01:19:03.290 --> 01:19:03.300 align:start position:0%
we Define an election cycle I think
 
01:19:04.729 --> 01:19:04.739 align:start position:0%
I just
 
01:19:08.570 --> 01:19:08.580 align:start position:0%
so if we go with Ross's idea we'd have
 
01:19:11.270 --> 01:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
to bump up the limits but it would it
 
01:19:13.729 --> 01:19:13.739 align:start position:0%
would still be the same amount of money
 
01:19:16.630 --> 01:19:16.640 align:start position:0%
it's just not divided into those three
 
01:19:19.370 --> 01:19:19.380 align:start position:0%
exploratory primary
 
01:19:22.250 --> 01:19:22.260 align:start position:0%
in general and that would be simpler and
 
01:19:24.590 --> 01:19:24.600 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure why we should just
 
01:19:28.430 --> 01:19:28.440 align:start position:0%
why we need to or should distinguish
 
01:19:31.729 --> 01:19:31.739 align:start position:0%
especially if something is difficult to
 
01:19:31.739 --> 01:19:34.310 align:start position:0%
especially if something is difficult to
Define

01:19:34.310 --> 01:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:36.950 --> 01:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
do we really need to do we might get
 
01:19:41.510 --> 01:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:43.310 --> 01:19:43.320 align:start position:0%
but I like it it's simple
 
01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:45.890 align:start position:0%
but I like it it's simple
[Music]

01:19:45.890 --> 01:19:45.900 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:19:47.930 --> 01:19:47.940 align:start position:0%
I mean maybe there also could be one
 
01:19:49.850 --> 01:19:49.860 align:start position:0%
registration category just catch-all
 
01:19:51.530 --> 01:19:51.540 align:start position:0%
category if you're
 
01:19:53.990 --> 01:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
you know spending raising money to
 
01:19:55.850 --> 01:19:55.860 align:start position:0%
advance a candidacy or measure measures
 
01:19:58.550 --> 01:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
and so forth then you can register as a
 
01:20:01.189 --> 01:20:01.199 align:start position:0%
catch-all be candidate exploratory
 
01:20:04.010 --> 01:20:04.020 align:start position:0%
candidate candidate committee the all
 
01:20:05.030 --> 01:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
those terms could be in the same
 
01:20:06.530 --> 01:20:06.540 align:start position:0%
registration you don't have to pick one
 
01:20:08.810 --> 01:20:08.820 align:start position:0%
you just pick a list of things right
 
01:20:10.970 --> 01:20:10.980 align:start position:0%
that's what I was and the same reporting
 
01:20:13.430 --> 01:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
requirements have applied to
 
01:20:17.870 --> 01:20:17.880 align:start position:0%
you know so registrant if
 
01:20:17.880 --> 01:20:19.250 align:start position:0%
you know so registrant if
in

01:20:19.250 --> 01:20:19.260 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:20:22.790 --> 01:20:22.800 align:start position:0%
whatever date January of 2023 just
 
01:20:25.250 --> 01:20:25.260 align:start position:0%
picking it at random
 
01:20:27.110 --> 01:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
you want to start publicizing yourself
 
01:20:29.870 --> 01:20:29.880 align:start position:0%
to people as a candidate whether quite
 
01:20:32.990 --> 01:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
you know whether broadly or more limited
 
01:20:35.330 --> 01:20:35.340 align:start position:0%
in a more limited fashion and represent
 
01:20:37.250 --> 01:20:37.260 align:start position:0%
yourself to them as a candidate and
 
01:20:39.229 --> 01:20:39.239 align:start position:0%
collect funds from them for that stated
 
01:20:39.239 --> 01:20:41.209 align:start position:0%
collect funds from them for that stated
purpose

01:20:41.209 --> 01:20:41.219 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
01:20:41.219 --> 01:20:43.450 align:start position:0%
purpose
uh

01:20:43.450 --> 01:20:43.460 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:20:46.370 --> 01:20:46.380 align:start position:0%
I gotta think about it more and I think
 
01:20:48.770 --> 01:20:48.780 align:start position:0%
the idea is if you and if you do that by
 
01:20:50.510 --> 01:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
spending more than a thousand dollars or
 
01:20:51.770 --> 01:20:51.780 align:start position:0%
by raising and spending whatever the
 
01:20:53.450 --> 01:20:53.460 align:start position:0%
number is a thousand twenty five hundred
 
01:20:54.530 --> 01:20:54.540 align:start position:0%
five thousand whatever you want to set
 
01:20:57.229 --> 01:20:57.239 align:start position:0%
it at if you raise or spend X then you
 
01:20:59.570 --> 01:20:59.580 align:start position:0%
have to you know register and Report now
 
01:21:01.010 --> 01:21:01.020 align:start position:0%
you can get you can take contributions
 
01:21:03.050 --> 01:21:03.060 align:start position:0%
privately from friends and supporters so
 
01:21:05.149 --> 01:21:05.159 align:start position:0%
you can say let me give you a
 
01:21:08.090 --> 01:21:08.100 align:start position:0%
50 bucks to because you to encourage you
 
01:21:09.709 --> 01:21:09.719 align:start position:0%
to run for office
 
01:21:12.890 --> 01:21:12.900 align:start position:0%
it's not really until you start this hmm
 
01:21:14.870 --> 01:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
as a candidate it's only when you spend
 
01:21:16.370 --> 01:21:16.380 align:start position:0%
a thousand that you have to register and
 
01:21:18.770 --> 01:21:18.780 align:start position:0%
report right as a candidate committee as
 
01:21:21.110 --> 01:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
soon as you 48 hours after you start any
 
01:21:22.669 --> 01:21:22.679 align:start position:0%
activity I think you have to register
 
01:21:24.770 --> 01:21:24.780 align:start position:0%
and the reporting requirements are a
 
01:21:26.450 --> 01:21:26.460 align:start position:0%
little different it's exp raising or
 
01:21:28.310 --> 01:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
spending for a candidate committee and
 
01:21:29.689 --> 01:21:29.699 align:start position:0%
people think those could just be made
 
01:21:32.810 --> 01:21:32.820 align:start position:0%
the same and and the thresholds the
 
01:21:34.729 --> 01:21:34.739 align:start position:0%
raising spending maybe it should be the
 
01:21:37.070 --> 01:21:37.080 align:start position:0%
same all those things for both
 
01:21:39.110 --> 01:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
right including the when you need to
 
01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:53.149 align:start position:0%
right including the when you need to
register

01:21:53.149 --> 01:21:53.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:55.490 --> 01:21:55.500 align:start position:0%
and to say for what it's worth the FEC
 
01:21:57.709 --> 01:21:57.719 align:start position:0%
has a very long statement on defining
 
01:22:00.649 --> 01:22:00.659 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about right
 
01:22:04.370 --> 01:22:04.380 align:start position:0%
so what Jerry FEC between testing the
 
01:22:06.890 --> 01:22:06.900 align:start position:0%
waters versus campaigning
 
01:22:12.169 --> 01:22:12.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:14.330 --> 01:22:14.340 align:start position:0%
we might pick up useful thoughts from
 
01:22:15.890 --> 01:22:15.900 align:start position:0%
that but yeah it's a long very
 
01:22:17.390 --> 01:22:17.400 align:start position:0%
interesting thing what you can and can't
 
01:22:17.400 --> 01:22:18.590 align:start position:0%
interesting thing what you can and can't
do

01:22:18.590 --> 01:22:18.600 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:22:19.970 --> 01:22:19.980 align:start position:0%
but we've
 
01:22:23.209 --> 01:22:23.219 align:start position:0%
my immediate reaction is that we would
 
01:22:24.649 --> 01:22:24.659 align:start position:0%
not want to bind ourselves to something
 
01:22:26.450 --> 01:22:26.460 align:start position:0%
that complicated yeah at the stable
 
01:22:28.550 --> 01:22:28.560 align:start position:0%
thing it's about the whole length of
 
01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:30.530 align:start position:0%
thing it's about the whole length of
664.

01:22:30.530 --> 01:22:30.540 align:start position:0%
664.
 
01:22:32.149 --> 01:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
you're kidding me
 
01:22:33.649 --> 01:22:33.659 align:start position:0%
pretty long
 
01:22:37.669 --> 01:22:37.679 align:start position:0%
what is what what he's uh he said it's
 
01:22:39.709 --> 01:22:39.719 align:start position:0%
the length of the waters for possible
 
01:22:42.130 --> 01:22:42.140 align:start position:0%
candidates yeah it's pretty long
 
01:22:44.810 --> 01:22:44.820 align:start position:0%
we just had publicly financed elections
 
01:22:46.430 --> 01:22:46.440 align:start position:0%
we could solve all of these problems
 
01:22:47.930 --> 01:22:47.940 align:start position:0%
there you go yeah that would keep the
 
01:22:49.790 --> 01:22:49.800 align:start position:0%
big money out of politics right you know
 
01:22:52.669 --> 01:22:52.679 align:start position:0%
the people who print money
 
01:22:52.679 --> 01:23:02.090 align:start position:0%
the people who print money
hahaha

01:23:02.090 --> 01:23:02.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:04.430 --> 01:23:04.440 align:start position:0%
don't talk about that list yeah that
 
01:23:06.350 --> 01:23:06.360 align:start position:0%
would be useful I'll do the same I'll
 
01:23:11.030 --> 01:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:12.950 --> 01:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
are people comfortable working in a
 
01:23:15.110 --> 01:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
Google doc in a shared dock have you
 
01:23:16.669 --> 01:23:16.679 align:start position:0%
done that before if you haven't I'm not
 
01:23:18.590 --> 01:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
going to introduce you to it but it's a
 
01:23:21.050 --> 01:23:21.060 align:start position:0%
way it's a fairly easy way of having
 
01:23:24.290 --> 01:23:24.300 align:start position:0%
multiple contributors I'm not ready to
 
01:23:25.490 --> 01:23:25.500 align:start position:0%
do that yet
 
01:23:25.500 --> 01:23:27.229 align:start position:0%
do that yet
myself

01:23:27.229 --> 01:23:27.239 align:start position:0%
myself
 
01:23:30.530 --> 01:23:30.540 align:start position:0%
I I would just the way I work I would
 
01:23:32.570 --> 01:23:32.580 align:start position:0%
prefer to have people share their
 
01:23:34.370 --> 01:23:34.380 align:start position:0%
thoughts in an independent document that
 
01:23:35.689 --> 01:23:35.699 align:start position:0%
I can
 
01:23:37.790 --> 01:23:37.800 align:start position:0%
look at locally without getting into the
 
01:23:41.270 --> 01:23:41.280 align:start position:0%
cloud it's just you like track changes
 
01:23:43.130 --> 01:23:43.140 align:start position:0%
well I'm not I'm not I'm not feeling
 
01:23:44.510 --> 01:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
like I'm at the point where I want to
 
01:23:46.610 --> 01:23:46.620 align:start position:0%
share it forget about it first yoga then
 
01:23:48.290 --> 01:23:48.300 align:start position:0%
group Google doc
 
01:23:54.669 --> 01:23:54.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:57.649 --> 01:23:57.659 align:start position:0%
is that fantasy life of yours again yeah
 
01:24:00.470 --> 01:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
wow that's very active I hope it's an
 
01:24:02.510 --> 01:24:02.520 align:start position:0%
enjoyable one
 
01:24:02.520 --> 01:24:04.490 align:start position:0%
enjoyable one
haha

01:24:04.490 --> 01:24:04.500 align:start position:0%
haha
 
01:24:06.770 --> 01:24:06.780 align:start position:0%
there was one thing that we talked about
 
01:24:09.470 --> 01:24:09.480 align:start position:0%
was about the required disclosure of
 
01:24:12.229 --> 01:24:12.239 align:start position:0%
who's paying for things like on the
 
01:24:15.290 --> 01:24:15.300 align:start position:0%
signs and whatever and do we need the
 
01:24:17.750 --> 01:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
address and do you
 
01:24:21.290 --> 01:24:21.300 align:start position:0%
um or do you just put the reference if
 
01:24:23.750 --> 01:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
there's a website put a website on there
 
01:24:25.550 --> 01:24:25.560 align:start position:0%
that's already allowed as long as the
 
01:24:28.790 --> 01:24:28.800 align:start position:0%
website includes the contact information
 
01:24:30.890 --> 01:24:30.900 align:start position:0%
if you were to sign out you put your
 
01:24:32.810 --> 01:24:32.820 align:start position:0%
website on it and the website has that
 
01:24:35.810 --> 01:24:35.820 align:start position:0%
information that's allowable
 
01:24:38.390 --> 01:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
that's my clear recollection I'm wrong
 
01:24:40.550 --> 01:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
tell me but okay I'm pretty sure that's
 
01:24:42.530 --> 01:24:42.540 align:start position:0%
right then wait and then what do you do
 
01:24:47.090 --> 01:24:47.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:50.149 --> 01:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
do you have to put it on buttons
 
01:24:54.770 --> 01:24:54.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:56.030 --> 01:24:56.040 align:start position:0%
and then there's the whole thing about
 
01:24:58.510 --> 01:24:58.520 align:start position:0%
digital ads which Ross was talking about
 
01:25:01.729 --> 01:25:01.739 align:start position:0%
too what do you do with digital ads yeah
 
01:25:03.110 --> 01:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
I don't have any feeling for that at
 
01:25:04.910 --> 01:25:04.920 align:start position:0%
this point okay
 
01:25:07.550 --> 01:25:07.560 align:start position:0%
and as far when it comes to signs how do
 
01:25:09.590 --> 01:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
you how practically speaking how do you
 
01:25:12.410 --> 01:25:12.420 align:start position:0%
enforce that anyway
 
01:25:15.649 --> 01:25:15.659 align:start position:0%
seriously I mean I've known people I
 
01:25:18.169 --> 01:25:18.179 align:start position:0%
know people at the local level at least
 
01:25:21.229 --> 01:25:21.239 align:start position:0%
who aren't even aware of the requirement
 
01:25:23.390 --> 01:25:23.400 align:start position:0%
and first time I when I ran for
 
01:25:25.970 --> 01:25:25.980 align:start position:0%
selectman I had I went back and pasted
 
01:25:28.370 --> 01:25:28.380 align:start position:0%
addresses on all my signs yeah and I
 
01:25:32.570 --> 01:25:32.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:35.270 --> 01:25:35.280 align:start position:0%
and that's under yeah I mean that would
 
01:25:37.550 --> 01:25:37.560 align:start position:0%
be under enforcement right good point we
 
01:25:40.070 --> 01:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
need to talk about you know and I was
 
01:25:42.470 --> 01:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
surprised to see I think I think I saw
 
01:25:44.630 --> 01:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
something in here that said if you're if
 
01:25:46.430 --> 01:25:46.440 align:start position:0%
you haven't filed everything you're not
 
01:25:48.229 --> 01:25:48.239 align:start position:0%
supposed to be uh
 
01:25:50.510 --> 01:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
uh you're not really
 
01:25:52.070 --> 01:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
I think they say you can't I saw that
 
01:25:53.630 --> 01:25:53.640 align:start position:0%
list in your notes you can't be
 
01:25:56.390 --> 01:25:56.400 align:start position:0%
nominated or elected if you're behind on
 
01:25:57.530 --> 01:25:57.540 align:start position:0%
your last
 
01:26:00.470 --> 01:26:00.480 align:start position:0%
financial and I'm that has not been
 
01:26:03.290 --> 01:26:03.300 align:start position:0%
enforced I don't think
 
01:26:06.709 --> 01:26:06.719 align:start position:0%
I saw that in your list I was just
 
01:26:08.570 --> 01:26:08.580 align:start position:0%
surprised I was like well so this wasn't
 
01:26:10.490 --> 01:26:10.500 align:start position:0%
that wasn't something you were proposing
 
01:26:11.810 --> 01:26:11.820 align:start position:0%
that was something you thought you saw
 
01:26:14.330 --> 01:26:14.340 align:start position:0%
in the IRS in the statute it's in here
 
01:26:14.340 --> 01:26:15.950 align:start position:0%
in the IRS in the statute it's in here
yeah

01:26:15.950 --> 01:26:15.960 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:26:18.050 --> 01:26:18.060 align:start position:0%
well I bet I bet that would be very
 
01:26:18.060 --> 01:26:19.910 align:start position:0%
well I bet I bet that would be very
challengable

01:26:19.910 --> 01:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
challengable
 
01:26:26.870 --> 01:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:29.270 --> 01:26:29.280 align:start position:0%
yeah no candidate she'll be entitled to
 
01:26:31.669 --> 01:26:31.679 align:start position:0%
the nomination or election until the
 
01:26:33.770 --> 01:26:33.780 align:start position:0%
sworn itemized statements required to be
 
01:26:36.010 --> 01:26:36.020 align:start position:0%
filed by him
 
01:26:40.010 --> 01:26:40.020 align:start position:0%
or they left out her in his behalf have
 
01:26:42.590 --> 01:26:42.600 align:start position:0%
been filed as required by
 
01:26:47.689 --> 01:26:47.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:53.030 --> 01:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
yeah but oh that's interesting
 
01:26:55.490 --> 01:26:55.500 align:start position:0%
yeah because that's definitely not been
 
01:26:55.500 --> 01:27:06.410 align:start position:0%
yeah because that's definitely not been
enforced

01:27:06.410 --> 01:27:06.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:09.470 --> 01:27:09.480 align:start position:0%
well that would be a good question for a
 
01:27:11.149 --> 01:27:11.159 align:start position:0%
representative of the Attorney General's
 
01:27:13.070 --> 01:27:13.080 align:start position:0%
office along with my question about how
 
01:27:15.709 --> 01:27:15.719 align:start position:0%
you enforce putting contact info on a
 
01:27:15.719 --> 01:27:16.729 align:start position:0%
you enforce putting contact info on a
sign

01:27:16.729 --> 01:27:16.739 align:start position:0%
sign
 
01:27:19.669 --> 01:27:19.679 align:start position:0%
right or mailing from out of state
 
01:27:21.950 --> 01:27:21.960 align:start position:0%
right remember that was the concern you
 
01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:23.149 align:start position:0%
right remember that was the concern you
had

01:27:23.149 --> 01:27:23.159 align:start position:0%
had
 
01:27:23.159 --> 01:27:24.410 align:start position:0%
had
so

01:27:24.410 --> 01:27:24.420 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:27:24.420 --> 01:27:25.669 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:27:25.669 --> 01:27:25.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:25.679 --> 01:27:28.490 align:start position:0%
um
yeah

01:27:28.490 --> 01:27:28.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:28.500 --> 01:27:33.830 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:27:33.830 --> 01:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:37.550 --> 01:27:37.560 align:start position:0%
well we have time uh yes if you'd like
 
01:27:40.030 --> 01:27:40.040 align:start position:0%
to ask a question
 
01:27:43.310 --> 01:27:43.320 align:start position:0%
yeah well having a allowed a member of
 
01:27:45.770 --> 01:27:45.780 align:start position:0%
the public to to ask a question I have
 
01:27:47.510 --> 01:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
to make sure that all viewpoints get the
 
01:27:50.570 --> 01:27:50.580 align:start position:0%
opportunity now since this is a this is
 
01:27:53.390 --> 01:27:53.400 align:start position:0%
a work session public meeting but not a
 
01:27:55.129 --> 01:27:55.139 align:start position:0%
public hearing
 
01:27:56.689 --> 01:27:56.699 align:start position:0%
um just a question I know you had said
 
01:27:59.149 --> 01:27:59.159 align:start position:0%
you're looking at a total rewrite but
 
01:28:00.590 --> 01:28:00.600 align:start position:0%
then you had this different ideas
 
01:28:02.750 --> 01:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
presented and I was just wondering if
 
01:28:04.910 --> 01:28:04.920 align:start position:0%
you're thinking that the final Pros
 
01:28:07.850 --> 01:28:07.860 align:start position:0%
product would be one bill with a total
 
01:28:10.310 --> 01:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
rewrite or if you're thinking that you
 
01:28:12.770 --> 01:28:12.780 align:start position:0%
know Ross Berry might introduce a bill
 
01:28:15.410 --> 01:28:15.420 align:start position:0%
that mandates the online system for
 
01:28:17.270 --> 01:28:17.280 align:start position:0%
certain races and that you all
 
01:28:19.669 --> 01:28:19.679 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor it and then the other idea
 
01:28:23.689 --> 01:28:23.699 align:start position:0%
around you know changing the the
 
01:28:26.510 --> 01:28:26.520 align:start position:0%
definition to make it clear on
 
01:28:29.510 --> 01:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
you know the date that you file a report
 
01:28:31.430 --> 01:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
you know is another bill and that you
 
01:28:33.649 --> 01:28:33.659 align:start position:0%
sort of delegate like representative
 
01:28:36.350 --> 01:28:36.360 align:start position:0%
Ward is going to take it up to and
 
01:28:38.930 --> 01:28:38.940 align:start position:0%
including and delete including and and
 
01:28:40.550 --> 01:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
that's a separate piece of legislation
 
01:28:43.189 --> 01:28:43.199 align:start position:0%
that you kind of are thinking of you
 
01:28:44.570 --> 01:28:44.580 align:start position:0%
know each different person Prime
 
01:28:47.030 --> 01:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
sponsoring a different idea
 
01:28:50.330 --> 01:28:50.340 align:start position:0%
or are we thinking one one complete and
 
01:28:53.030 --> 01:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
total massive bill
 
01:28:53.040 --> 01:28:55.010 align:start position:0%
total massive bill
uh

01:28:55.010 --> 01:28:55.020 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:28:58.129 --> 01:28:58.139 align:start position:0%
I can only answer for myself my function
 
01:29:01.570 --> 01:29:01.580 align:start position:0%
as chairman I think is obvious is to
 
01:29:04.070 --> 01:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
arrange things like scheduling meetings
 
01:29:05.870 --> 01:29:05.880 align:start position:0%
and making sure we all have an
 
01:29:07.910 --> 01:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak our thoughts that's
 
01:29:10.129 --> 01:29:10.139 align:start position:0%
you know facilitate the discussion but
 
01:29:13.610 --> 01:29:13.620 align:start position:0%
speaking for myself I don't have that
 
01:29:15.770 --> 01:29:15.780 align:start position:0%
level of organization in my thoughts yet
 
01:29:18.350 --> 01:29:18.360 align:start position:0%
having looked at the number of
 
01:29:22.129 --> 01:29:22.139 align:start position:0%
uh seemingly minor seemingly minor
 
01:29:25.790 --> 01:29:25.800 align:start position:0%
issues in the current statutes
 
01:29:27.830 --> 01:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
my feeling is we go after the things we
 
01:29:30.709 --> 01:29:30.719 align:start position:0%
can agree to fix and the idea of a total
 
01:29:34.370 --> 01:29:34.380 align:start position:0%
rewrite sounds too ambitious to me
 
01:29:38.870 --> 01:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
and how we would organize the
 
01:29:40.610 --> 01:29:40.620 align:start position:0%
actually trying to make changes by
 
01:29:43.729 --> 01:29:43.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:45.770 --> 01:29:45.780 align:start position:0%
there may be some things we can agree on
 
01:29:47.270 --> 01:29:47.280 align:start position:0%
that are simple enough we could get
 
01:29:48.830 --> 01:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
something prepared
 
01:29:51.290 --> 01:29:51.300 align:start position:0%
for the next legislative year
 
01:29:51.300 --> 01:29:52.910 align:start position:0%
for the next legislative year
uh

01:29:52.910 --> 01:29:52.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:29:56.030 --> 01:29:56.040 align:start position:0%
but I think probably should keep our
 
01:29:58.490 --> 01:29:58.500 align:start position:0%
focus on the stated purpose of the the
 
01:29:59.990 --> 01:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee which is to prepare a
 
01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:01.430 align:start position:0%
subcommittee which is to prepare a
report

01:30:01.430 --> 01:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
report
 
01:30:03.470 --> 01:30:03.480 align:start position:0%
on recommendations that make sense to
 
01:30:06.290 --> 01:30:06.300 align:start position:0%
you guys makes sense to me but
 
01:30:08.570 --> 01:30:08.580 align:start position:0%
okay okay I've said I've spoken for
 
01:30:11.450 --> 01:30:11.460 align:start position:0%
myself now others we're going to hear
 
01:30:13.010 --> 01:30:13.020 align:start position:0%
from the others that's an interesting
 
01:30:13.020 --> 01:30:16.370 align:start position:0%
from the others that's an interesting
question

01:30:16.370 --> 01:30:16.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:18.590 --> 01:30:18.600 align:start position:0%
I mean I'm open I'm open to different
 
01:30:20.450 --> 01:30:20.460 align:start position:0%
strategies once we get to the point
 
01:30:22.490 --> 01:30:22.500 align:start position:0%
where if we got to the point where the
 
01:30:25.550 --> 01:30:25.560 align:start position:0%
the committee as a whole is in agreement
 
01:30:28.729 --> 01:30:28.739 align:start position:0%
about a number of desirable changes then
 
01:30:30.470 --> 01:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
it just becomes a question of how to
 
01:30:32.330 --> 01:30:32.340 align:start position:0%
advocate for them and persuade our
 
01:30:35.209 --> 01:30:35.219 align:start position:0%
colleagues and sometimes dividing things
 
01:30:36.709 --> 01:30:36.719 align:start position:0%
up into different bills when each one
 
01:30:39.410 --> 01:30:39.420 align:start position:0%
requires a different argument makes more
 
01:30:40.970 --> 01:30:40.980 align:start position:0%
sense because you can make the discrete
 
01:30:43.189 --> 01:30:43.199 align:start position:0%
arguments rather than making 16
 
01:30:46.129 --> 01:30:46.139 align:start position:0%
arguments about one bill but if there's
 
01:30:48.649 --> 01:30:48.659 align:start position:0%
a you know series of grammatical fixes
 
01:30:50.810 --> 01:30:50.820 align:start position:0%
in different sections of the law then
 
01:30:52.250 --> 01:30:52.260 align:start position:0%
you might bundle those all together and
 
01:30:53.689 --> 01:30:53.699 align:start position:0%
it would be a true housekeeping Bill
 
01:30:56.870 --> 01:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
unlike unlike most of the bills that are
 
01:31:01.370 --> 01:31:01.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:03.970 --> 01:31:03.980 align:start position:0%
yeah then this is only my second term
 
01:31:06.890 --> 01:31:06.900 align:start position:0%
but I've often heard
 
01:31:09.169 --> 01:31:09.179 align:start position:0%
that the New Hampshire house does not
 
01:31:12.590 --> 01:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
like what some call Omnibus bills bills
 
01:31:14.890 --> 01:31:14.900 align:start position:0%
that have a number of
 
01:31:17.270 --> 01:31:17.280 align:start position:0%
topics that are not closely related and
 
01:31:18.770 --> 01:31:18.780 align:start position:0%
I have to say that's my feeling on the
 
01:31:21.550 --> 01:31:21.560 align:start position:0%
matter too personally so
 
01:31:23.990 --> 01:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
what representative mirrorhead was just
 
01:31:25.850 --> 01:31:25.860 align:start position:0%
describing I think is consistent with
 
01:31:28.850 --> 01:31:28.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:33.290 --> 01:31:33.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:39.470 --> 01:31:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:41.689 --> 01:31:41.699 align:start position:0%
you have all of our stuff would be on
 
01:31:43.970 --> 01:31:43.980 align:start position:0%
campaign Finance true in this chapter so
 
01:31:46.610 --> 01:31:46.620 align:start position:0%
I don't think of that as an Omnibus Bill
 
01:31:50.090 --> 01:31:50.100 align:start position:0%
I think that a long complicated bill
 
01:31:52.729 --> 01:31:52.739 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned about the definitions so
 
01:31:54.530 --> 01:31:54.540 align:start position:0%
that if we don't get the definitions
 
01:31:57.169 --> 01:31:57.179 align:start position:0%
passed that we want are these other
 
01:31:59.810 --> 01:31:59.820 align:start position:0%
bills going to make sense with these
 
01:32:03.350 --> 01:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
existing so part the yeah part of me is
 
01:32:05.810 --> 01:32:05.820 align:start position:0%
like we need to clean up some of these
 
01:32:09.830 --> 01:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
definitions or add them so if we don't
 
01:32:12.770 --> 01:32:12.780 align:start position:0%
pass them as a package I'm concerned
 
01:32:17.149 --> 01:32:17.159 align:start position:0%
that we may not solve the issues that we
 
01:32:19.370 --> 01:32:19.380 align:start position:0%
want to solve
 
01:32:19.380 --> 01:32:20.570 align:start position:0%
want to solve
uh

01:32:20.570 --> 01:32:20.580 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:32:23.390 --> 01:32:23.400 align:start position:0%
uh that's that's the way I look at
 
01:32:25.070 --> 01:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
things I mean we all have dealt with
 
01:32:29.030 --> 01:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
yeah difficult complex problems and I
 
01:32:31.430 --> 01:32:31.440 align:start position:0%
know in my background sometimes you're
 
01:32:34.370 --> 01:32:34.380 align:start position:0%
lucky and you can can split these
 
01:32:36.530 --> 01:32:36.540 align:start position:0%
components into parts that are
 
01:32:38.450 --> 01:32:38.460 align:start position:0%
independent of each other and and so
 
01:32:40.610 --> 01:32:40.620 align:start position:0%
address a series of simpler problems I
 
01:32:41.570 --> 01:32:41.580 align:start position:0%
think that's what you're talking about
 
01:32:44.149 --> 01:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
I'm sure it's true and must be true in
 
01:32:44.159 --> 01:32:45.229 align:start position:0%
I'm sure it's true and must be true in
most

01:32:45.229 --> 01:32:45.239 align:start position:0%
most
 
01:32:45.239 --> 01:32:51.229 align:start position:0%
most
fields

01:32:51.229 --> 01:32:51.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:54.550 --> 01:32:54.560 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that unless we get all the
 
01:32:56.570 --> 01:32:56.580 align:start position:0%
definitions right that we can
 
01:33:00.470 --> 01:33:00.480 align:start position:0%
necessarily peace peace meal it so we
 
01:33:02.870 --> 01:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
need to kind of think through if we're
 
01:33:05.510 --> 01:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
going to do it now so you so I would so
 
01:33:05.520 --> 01:33:06.910 align:start position:0%
going to do it now so you so I would so
you're

01:33:06.910 --> 01:33:06.920 align:start position:0%
you're
 
01:33:09.470 --> 01:33:09.480 align:start position:0%
prioritize you're you're stating what
 
01:33:11.330 --> 01:33:11.340 align:start position:0%
you think would be a priority for which
 
01:33:14.629 --> 01:33:14.639 align:start position:0%
pieces we should deal with first right
 
01:33:19.250 --> 01:33:19.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:20.390 --> 01:33:20.400 align:start position:0%
last week because I said we're talking
 
01:33:23.270 --> 01:33:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:26.270 --> 01:33:26.280 align:start position:0%
and I was like good boy so you said you
 
01:33:28.850 --> 01:33:28.860 align:start position:0%
thought what I was like oh boy yeah I
 
01:33:31.250 --> 01:33:31.260 align:start position:0%
mean right as in that's okay there's a
 
01:33:32.570 --> 01:33:32.580 align:start position:0%
lot of stuff in here that we've not
 
01:33:35.649 --> 01:33:35.659 align:start position:0%
talked about so I know
 
01:33:38.870 --> 01:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
so I'm not sure but I I was thinking we
 
01:33:43.430 --> 01:33:43.440 align:start position:0%
were doing an Omnibus one but I I
 
01:33:45.590 --> 01:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
that is intimidating
 
01:33:47.930 --> 01:33:47.940 align:start position:0%
and I mean go ahead representative Lane
 
01:33:50.270 --> 01:33:50.280 align:start position:0%
you're you're you know describing a
 
01:33:51.709 --> 01:33:51.719 align:start position:0%
situation where the different parts of
 
01:33:53.629 --> 01:33:53.639 align:start position:0%
the bill are logically connected yeah
 
01:33:56.030 --> 01:33:56.040 align:start position:0%
and where you need to redefine things or
 
01:33:57.709 --> 01:33:57.719 align:start position:0%
clean up definitions in order to get to
 
01:33:59.689 --> 01:33:59.699 align:start position:0%
the next thing and have so that would be
 
01:34:01.189 --> 01:34:01.199 align:start position:0%
that then there's a reason to have
 
01:34:03.649 --> 01:34:03.659 align:start position:0%
things bundled together and and the less
 
01:34:05.030 --> 01:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
there's a reason to bundle things
 
01:34:07.189 --> 01:34:07.199 align:start position:0%
together then maybe we don't bundle them
 
01:34:09.830 --> 01:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
together but let's be open to whatever
 
01:34:12.649 --> 01:34:12.659 align:start position:0%
strategy makes things most transparent
 
01:34:17.090 --> 01:34:17.100 align:start position:0%
to voters to our colleagues and and and
 
01:34:19.070 --> 01:34:19.080 align:start position:0%
seems just most fair and effective
 
01:34:21.169 --> 01:34:21.179 align:start position:0%
whatever that is
 
01:34:24.530 --> 01:34:24.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:26.270 --> 01:34:26.280 align:start position:0%
do you have any thoughts on this
 
01:34:28.790 --> 01:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
representative Ward at this point you
 
01:34:34.729 --> 01:34:34.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:38.270 --> 01:34:38.280 align:start position:0%
it's open right
 
01:34:40.610 --> 01:34:40.620 align:start position:0%
so I think that is a as complete an
 
01:34:42.050 --> 01:34:42.060 align:start position:0%
answer as we can give to your question
 
01:34:43.970 --> 01:34:43.980 align:start position:0%
we're working on it
 
01:34:46.430 --> 01:34:46.440 align:start position:0%
it's only 25 Pages it's not like it's a
 
01:34:49.790 --> 01:34:49.800 align:start position:0%
big deal excuse me the 664 is only 25
 
01:34:52.310 --> 01:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
Pages it's not very I'm gonna dump it
 
01:34:54.890 --> 01:34:54.900 align:start position:0%
into chat GPT tonight and ask chat GPT
 
01:34:57.050 --> 01:34:57.060 align:start position:0%
to revise it revise the whole thing and
 
01:35:00.530 --> 01:35:00.540 align:start position:0%
I'll have it by Friday okay
 
01:35:02.870 --> 01:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
well I I did I did open it to questions
 
01:35:05.570 --> 01:35:05.580 align:start position:0%
from the public so I am obligated to
 
01:35:07.070 --> 01:35:07.080 align:start position:0%
make sure that if anyone has another

one another
 
01:35:49.250 --> 01:35:49.260 align:start position:0%
um campaign Finance reform has been an
 
01:35:51.530 --> 01:35:51.540 align:start position:0%
issue for me for a long time ever since
 
01:35:54.770 --> 01:35:54.780 align:start position:0%
I joined open democracy action and I am
 
01:35:57.530 --> 01:35:57.540 align:start position:0%
so happy to see
 
01:35:59.510 --> 01:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
Republicans and Democrats working
 
01:36:01.910 --> 01:36:01.920 align:start position:0%

for that comment and you're welcome
 
01:36:13.129 --> 01:36:13.139 align:start position:0%
thinking for myself
 
01:36:15.530 --> 01:36:15.540 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure the areas where we'll have
 
01:36:17.450 --> 01:36:17.460 align:start position:0%
vigorous discussion will present
 
01:36:19.729 --> 01:36:19.739 align:start position:0%
themselves at some point but
 
01:36:23.570 --> 01:36:23.580 align:start position:0%

01:36:30.900 --> 01:36:33.050 align:start position:0%
brief period of public comment is now
closed

01:36:33.050 --> 01:36:33.060 align:start position:0%

and thank you I appreciate the interest
 
01:36:40.910 --> 01:36:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:43.850 --> 01:36:43.860 align:start position:0%
we don't have to go to noon if we've run
 
01:36:45.649 --> 01:36:45.659 align:start position:0%
out of things to talk about now I'm not
 
01:36:47.930 --> 01:36:47.940 align:start position:0%
urging we stop but I'm perfectly willing
 
01:36:51.050 --> 01:36:51.060 align:start position:0%
to but I mean I think I have my marching
 
01:36:53.570 --> 01:36:53.580 align:start position:0%
orders and and it would be
 
01:36:55.129 --> 01:36:55.139 align:start position:0%
don't have anything else on my agenda
 
01:36:56.209 --> 01:36:56.219 align:start position:0%
this morning
 
01:36:58.790 --> 01:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
and I've actually acquired an action
 
01:37:03.590 --> 01:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:05.990 --> 01:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
um I was thinking that maybe we could
 
01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:07.490 align:start position:0%
um I was thinking that maybe we could
contact

01:37:07.490 --> 01:37:07.500 align:start position:0%
contact
 
01:37:10.090 --> 01:37:10.100 align:start position:0%
UM the national what's that legislative
 
01:37:13.810 --> 01:37:13.820 align:start position:0%
service the National Conference
 
01:37:16.250 --> 01:37:16.260 align:start position:0%
legislative I can't remember the name
 
01:37:20.410 --> 01:37:20.420 align:start position:0%
the acronym but they have
 
01:37:22.430 --> 01:37:22.440 align:start position:0%
materials and stuff
 
01:37:24.290 --> 01:37:24.300 align:start position:0%
that I thought we might
 
01:37:26.510 --> 01:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
find useful at least as far as
 
01:37:29.870 --> 01:37:29.880 align:start position:0%
addressing some of these definitions
 
01:37:31.850 --> 01:37:31.860 align:start position:0%
and some of the issues that other people
 
01:37:33.350 --> 01:37:33.360 align:start position:0%
have run into so we don't have to
 
01:37:35.629 --> 01:37:35.639 align:start position:0%
reinvent the wheel
 
01:37:38.149 --> 01:37:38.159 align:start position:0%
um would you like me to do that or do
 
01:37:39.050 --> 01:37:39.060 align:start position:0%
you want to do that yeah I think that
 
01:37:40.550 --> 01:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
would be I would like you to do that I
 
01:37:42.649 --> 01:37:42.659 align:start position:0%
think it would be useful for me too okay
 
01:37:45.649 --> 01:37:45.659 align:start position:0%
if we can uh mine what other people have
 
01:37:47.930 --> 01:37:47.940 align:start position:0%
done for the things that will work here
 
01:37:50.990 --> 01:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire right why
 
01:37:53.030 --> 01:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
it's been my experience it is easier
 
01:37:55.490 --> 01:37:55.500 align:start position:0%
it's often easier to recognize a good
 
01:38:01.070 --> 01:38:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:03.350 --> 01:38:03.360 align:start position:0%
it's easier to copy the wheel but to
 
01:38:03.360 --> 01:38:04.510 align:start position:0%
it's easier to copy the wheel but to
reinvent

01:38:04.510 --> 01:38:04.520 align:start position:0%
reinvent
 
01:38:08.750 --> 01:38:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:11.990 --> 01:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:14.090 --> 01:38:14.100 align:start position:0%
well once an idea exists and it's out
 
01:38:15.290 --> 01:38:15.300 align:start position:0%
there it's
 
01:38:21.110 --> 01:38:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:22.669 --> 01:38:22.679 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:38:25.070 --> 01:38:25.080 align:start position:0%
so do we amongst us feel a need for
 
01:38:30.709 --> 01:38:30.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:30.719 --> 01:38:31.910 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:38:31.910 --> 01:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:38:34.790 --> 01:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
then we can if someone would like to
 
01:38:37.189 --> 01:38:37.199 align:start position:0%
will be semi-formal above someone would
 
01:38:39.470 --> 01:38:39.480 align:start position:0%
like to ask ask for a motion to adjourn
 
01:38:41.930 --> 01:38:41.940 align:start position:0%
or just assert my uh I'll tell you what
 
01:38:43.910 --> 01:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
so moved okay
 
01:38:55.610 --> 01:38:55.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:58.310 --> 01:38:58.320 align:start position:0%
two weeks same time same place that I'm
