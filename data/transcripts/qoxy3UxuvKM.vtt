with that I will hand it off to
 
00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
Ann Fitzgerald who's our director of

house committee services and she'll
 
00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:36.419 align:start position:0%
discuss with you the concept of
 
00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:48.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair good afternoon
 
00:06:52.249 --> 00:06:52.259 align:start position:0%
everyone here we are again
 
00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:54.840 align:start position:0%
um I just want to my as you can see
 
00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
we've laid out a portion again of
 
00:06:59.629 --> 00:06:59.639 align:start position:0%
presentations by the staff as well as at
 
00:07:01.249 --> 00:07:01.259 align:start position:0%
the conclusion we'll have
 
00:07:03.409 --> 00:07:03.419 align:start position:0%
um information you requested our last
 
00:07:03.419 --> 00:07:04.490 align:start position:0%
um information you requested our last
meeting

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:04.500 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
00:07:07.309 --> 00:07:07.319 align:start position:0%
but um first item up for the piece I'm
 
00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:09.360 align:start position:0%
doing right now is continuing education
 
00:07:12.409 --> 00:07:12.419 align:start position:0%
and I just want to mention that we have
 
00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:14.340 align:start position:0%
done as a member at us before we've done
 
00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:17.460 align:start position:0%
continuing education in the past whether
 
00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:19.380 align:start position:0%
it is for chairman
 
00:07:22.189 --> 00:07:22.199 align:start position:0%
for freshmen at orientation or for the
 
00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:24.300 align:start position:0%
entire membership where we have had a
 
00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:27.240 align:start position:0%
full day just dedicated to study
 
00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:28.520 align:start position:0%
commissions and
 
00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:31.620 align:start position:0%
committees or a half day
 
00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:33.780 align:start position:0%
um so we will be putting those proposals
 
00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:36.780 align:start position:0%
again together for the speaker and we
 
00:07:38.749 --> 00:07:38.759 align:start position:0%
have a panel made up of traditionally
 
00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:41.160 align:start position:0%
it's a panel of staff and legislators as
 
00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
well and we have a um
 
00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:47.180 align:start position:0%
we go through every aspect of every
 
00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
possible configuration of a study
 
00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
commission so we plan to do that again
 
00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:55.380 align:start position:0%
and we will have
 
00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:55.909 align:start position:0%
and we will have
um

00:07:55.909 --> 00:07:55.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:58.390 --> 00:07:58.400 align:start position:0%
that information for you moving forward
 
00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:01.740 align:start position:0%
at one of our future meetings uh Dave
 
00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:04.080 align:start position:0%
alicones will explain what the trifold
 
00:08:07.129 --> 00:08:07.139 align:start position:0%
piece is as far as handouts go and then
 
00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:09.240 align:start position:0%
we are going to look at how we could
 
00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
design some videos to explain
 
00:08:15.529 --> 00:08:15.539 align:start position:0%
um about members possibly requesting
 
00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:18.240 align:start position:0%
study commissions and the background and
 
00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
as you know we already have our video
 
00:08:22.969 --> 00:08:22.979 align:start position:0%
set up from our first meeting when we
 
00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
introduce the entire concept to you and
 
00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:29.460 align:start position:0%
we keep asking staff to take a look at
 
00:08:31.129 --> 00:08:31.139 align:start position:0%
that as well as members we have when
 
00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
people ask say just please watch the
 
00:08:35.269 --> 00:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
first hour and a half to understand the
 
00:08:36.969 --> 00:08:36.979 align:start position:0%
background of study
 
00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:39.180 align:start position:0%
committees and commissions so we have
 
00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:42.360 align:start position:0%
our first before I into a video but
 
00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:45.240 align:start position:0%
we'll organize a system for you later as
 
00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:47.820 align:start position:0%
well but as you can imagine all of these
 
00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:49.680 align:start position:0%
efforts take time as we're in the middle
 
00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
of still of the legislative session we
 
00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
want to put together a good product for
 
00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
you to see in the future
 
00:08:58.310 --> 00:08:58.320 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:01.140 align:start position:0%
with that I can Aaron just turn it right
 
00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:04.320 align:start position:0%
over to Dave right thank you
 
00:09:06.829 --> 00:09:06.839 align:start position:0%
well wait did you have any questions
 
00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:11.100 align:start position:0%
no I have one question it the uh
 
00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:13.380 align:start position:0%
the the videos
 
00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:16.740 align:start position:0%
with would it be appropriate to have uh
 
00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:19.740 align:start position:0%
in continuing education uh for this
 
00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:22.860 align:start position:0%
setting to be uh maybe the the two
 
00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
different caucuses uh uh showing these
 
00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:27.660 align:start position:0%
videos well that probably will be in the
 
00:09:29.509 --> 00:09:29.519 align:start position:0%
future as we'll have all those proposals
 
00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:31.860 align:start position:0%
designed for you so you can take we
 
00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:33.480 align:start position:0%
should certainly consider that because
 
00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:36.060 align:start position:0%
it's another Avenue to communicate with
 
00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:39.360 align:start position:0%
the members um beyond our traditional
 
00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:42.660 align:start position:0%
um programs that maybe the videos would
 
00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:44.580 align:start position:0%
could be to somebody through caucuses
 
00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
but we could talk about that as an
 
00:09:58.130 --> 00:09:58.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:00.420 align:start position:0%
thank you again Dave alaconis OLS
 
00:10:02.509 --> 00:10:02.519 align:start position:0%
director welcome Dave thank you much
 
00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
representative we are
 
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:07.200 align:start position:0%
we have been talking uh the past uh
 
00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:09.480 align:start position:0%
several weeks and one of the areas that
 
00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:12.720 align:start position:0%
uh we'd like OS would like to pursue is
 
00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:16.380 align:start position:0%
having a brochure that explains the
 
00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:19.860 align:start position:0%
commission uh making process and the
 
00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:22.200 align:start position:0%
questions that members should ask of
 
00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:25.260 align:start position:0%
themselves and all others involved as
 
00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:27.480 align:start position:0%
they come into our office
 
00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:29.160 align:start position:0%
really by the time that we get that
 
00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:31.980 align:start position:0%
email or they're in in our doorway it's
 
00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:35.100 align:start position:0%
too late uh that filing period is uh
 
00:10:38.329 --> 00:10:38.339 align:start position:0%
very intense time uh it's really not
 
00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:41.880 align:start position:0%
it's not optimal to have that discussion
 
00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
at that point so our goal is to have
 
00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:46.200 align:start position:0%
something out there well in advance they
 
00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:49.260 align:start position:0%
say a brochure it would be online also
 
00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:50.700 align:start position:0%
of course there'd be information there
 
00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:53.700 align:start position:0%
that is more than what OLS requests or
 
00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:56.220 align:start position:0%
or needs in filing legislation so we
 
00:10:58.370 --> 00:10:58.380 align:start position:0%
will be working with with Ann and house
 
00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:00.060 align:start position:0%
committee services and anyone else in
 
00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:02.940 align:start position:0%
this process uh you certainly as well to
 
00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:04.680 align:start position:0%
uh to put something like that together
 
00:11:07.009 --> 00:11:07.019 align:start position:0%
but it's that's a that's a component of
 
00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
continuing education certainly we we
 
00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
talked about the the questionnaire
 
00:11:17.329 --> 00:11:17.339 align:start position:0%
at our point of entry in OLS and it's
 
00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:19.560 align:start position:0%
the conclusion was that it has limited
 
00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:21.720 align:start position:0%
use because once we take that
 
00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
information in it is privileged
 
00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:26.220 align:start position:0%
information so a member could say no I
 
00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:27.720 align:start position:0%
didn't check with anyone no I didn't
 
00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:30.120 align:start position:0%
talk to anyone and
 
00:11:32.389 --> 00:11:32.399 align:start position:0%
it sits with us and you wouldn't no one
 
00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:34.500 align:start position:0%
else would know that so that's kind of a
 
00:11:38.269 --> 00:11:38.279 align:start position:0%
uh I don't think would meet what the
 
00:11:40.009 --> 00:11:40.019 align:start position:0%
desires were when we talked about that
 
00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:42.240 align:start position:0%
in the in the first in the first case so
 
00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
uh moving back to the the continuing
 
00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
education and having information out
 
00:11:49.069 --> 00:11:49.079 align:start position:0%
there available uh before they come in
 
00:11:50.569 --> 00:11:50.579 align:start position:0%
our door is is what we're going to be
 
00:11:51.949 --> 00:11:51.959 align:start position:0%
focusing on
 
00:11:55.069 --> 00:11:55.079 align:start position:0%
very good thank you
 
00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:04.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:17.509 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:12:17.509 --> 00:12:17.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:19.560 align:start position:0%
well I think we
 
00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
spoke with Ann earlier we that's kind of
 
00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:24.180 align:start position:0%
a hold out from when we were thinking
 
00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
about doing the questionnaire in OLS and
 
00:12:29.269 --> 00:12:29.279 align:start position:0%
uh but I think that would have limited
 
00:12:30.949 --> 00:12:30.959 align:start position:0%
this is this is kind of a work in
 
00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:32.540 align:start position:0%
progress from
 
00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
some of the some of these slides from
 
00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:37.260 align:start position:0%
last week uh that uh
 
00:12:39.769 --> 00:12:39.779 align:start position:0%
again the question I will have much of
 
00:12:41.329 --> 00:12:41.339 align:start position:0%
that same information that we suggest
 
00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:44.100 align:start position:0%
that the member does in advance so we
 
00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:45.480 align:start position:0%
want them to work together so that
 
00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:55.100 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:10.440 align:start position:0%
all right good afternoon I'm Jim ciancy
 
00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
this is Paul Smith just kidding
 
00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:15.110 align:start position:0%
this is Paul Smith just kidding
uh

00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
so we're here to talk just a little bit
 
00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:18.720 align:start position:0%
about uh some of the
 
00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:21.060 align:start position:0%
um the ways to increase visibility of
 
00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
commission bills
 
00:13:24.769 --> 00:13:24.779 align:start position:0%
um and one of the one of the few things
 
00:13:26.449 --> 00:13:26.459 align:start position:0%
that we've discussed it so there was
 
00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:27.720 align:start position:0%
this discussion earlier on about
 
00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:32.100 align:start position:0%
creating a CN to add to the FN and in
 
00:13:34.129 --> 00:13:34.139 align:start position:0%
discussion we sort of uh hovered around
 
00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:35.880 align:start position:0%
the fact that we we really think they
 
00:13:36.769 --> 00:13:36.779 align:start position:0%
would need to be done through
 
00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
legislation additionally we get into
 
00:13:41.269 --> 00:13:41.279 align:start position:0%
sort of a word suit problem
 
00:13:46.129 --> 00:13:46.139 align:start position:0%
um you know think of hb2 HB 2 fnal CN so
 
00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
we're we're getting into you know kind
 
00:13:51.949 --> 00:13:51.959 align:start position:0%
of confusing uh terms here so what we
 
00:13:51.959 --> 00:13:53.569 align:start position:0%
of confusing uh terms here so what we
suggested

00:13:53.569 --> 00:13:53.579 align:start position:0%
suggested
 
00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:55.680 align:start position:0%
um and uh the by the way these points
 
00:13:57.290 --> 00:13:57.300 align:start position:0%
are things that that we can handle
 
00:13:59.150 --> 00:13:59.160 align:start position:0%
internally without actually having to
 
00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:01.980 align:start position:0%
change law or or rules or anything uh
 
00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:04.860 align:start position:0%
but the analysis and we we've
 
00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:07.620 align:start position:0%
highlighted uh an example here from a
 
00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:09.060 align:start position:0%
bill that was sponsored by John Hunt
 
00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:12.540 align:start position:0%
regarding liquor every time we have a
 
00:14:14.329 --> 00:14:14.339 align:start position:0%
bill that's an agency request we list
 
00:14:15.829 --> 00:14:15.839 align:start position:0%
right on the analysis this on the front
 
00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:17.300 align:start position:0%
page of each bill
 
00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
that what the bill does in terms of the
 
00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:21.720 align:start position:0%
analysis but also that it was an agency
 
00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
request and OLS has agreed that they
 
00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:29.220 align:start position:0%
will add in another line this bill
 
00:14:30.889 --> 00:14:30.899 align:start position:0%
creates a commission or this bill
 
00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:34.500 align:start position:0%
creates a statutory study so that is a
 
00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:35.820 align:start position:0%
that's going to be a huge indicator
 
00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
right there also in terms of we talked
 
00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
about the check box before so I want to
 
00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:42.240 align:start position:0%
explain a little bit about what that
 
00:14:46.069 --> 00:14:46.079 align:start position:0%
means when we purchased our XM
 
00:14:49.389 --> 00:14:49.399 align:start position:0%
legislator software suite back in 2015
 
00:14:52.129 --> 00:14:52.139 align:start position:0%
it was sort of envisioned that we would
 
00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
have this process to know right from the
 
00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:56.820 align:start position:0%
very beginning whether or not we would
 
00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:57.850 align:start position:0%
very beginning whether or not we would
have

00:14:57.850 --> 00:14:57.860 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:15:00.769 --> 00:15:00.779 align:start position:0%
whether a bill would create a committee
 
00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
or Commission
 
00:15:04.009 --> 00:15:04.019 align:start position:0%
unfortunately due to some
 
00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
misunderstandings and practices over the
 
00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:08.100 align:start position:0%
years that really wasn't followed
 
00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
through with however we have found uh
 
00:15:12.949 --> 00:15:12.959 align:start position:0%
the problem and we've corrected that
 
00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:16.440 align:start position:0%
problem so now once you go to file a
 
00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:20.160 align:start position:0%
bill in OLS the attorney can check the
 
00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:22.440 align:start position:0%
box right from the beginning
 
00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
uh if a bill is amended along the pers
 
00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
the process during the process at any
 
00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:30.360 align:start position:0%
time either the house or the Senate
 
00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:32.940 align:start position:0%
clerk also have access now to check that
 
00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:37.740 align:start position:0%
box so if if a bill as as you know many
 
00:15:39.949 --> 00:15:39.959 align:start position:0%
bills turn into studies
 
00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
um so we have that ability to check that
 
00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:44.160 align:start position:0%
during the committee process now or
 
00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
during the uh the bills life so those
 
00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:49.560 align:start position:0%
are things that that we we can do
 
00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
without necessarily changing the process
 
00:15:56.090 --> 00:15:56.100 align:start position:0%
additionally uh we have uh asked our I.T
 
00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:57.350 align:start position:0%
additionally uh we have uh asked our I.T
folks

00:15:57.350 --> 00:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
folks
 
00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:00.240 align:start position:0%
um you're all I'm I know you're all very
 
00:16:02.269 --> 00:16:02.279 align:start position:0%
familiar with the advanced Bill data
 
00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:06.120 align:start position:0%
search on our web page on that page are
 
00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:07.860 align:start position:0%
a bunch of radio buttons at the bottom
 
00:16:10.129 --> 00:16:10.139 align:start position:0%
uh where you can click certain things
 
00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:13.860 align:start position:0%
that you want information and the IT
 
00:16:17.389 --> 00:16:17.399 align:start position:0%
folks have told us that they can add a
 
00:16:20.329 --> 00:16:20.339 align:start position:0%
statutory or a statutory committee or
 
00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:23.940 align:start position:0%
commission radio button so that you can
 
00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:27.540 align:start position:0%
search by that as as something that
 
00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:29.940 align:start position:0%
would pull up a list for you of of bills
 
00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
that were filed in any given year so
 
00:16:34.129 --> 00:16:34.139 align:start position:0%
those are a couple of big things right
 
00:16:37.069 --> 00:16:37.079 align:start position:0%
out the shoot that I think uh can can
 
00:16:41.449 --> 00:16:41.459 align:start position:0%
help in terms of the visibility aspect
 
00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:43.380 align:start position:0%
um again that analysis right on the
 
00:16:45.829 --> 00:16:45.839 align:start position:0%
front page of every bill that's going to
 
00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
be helpful in terms of of the speaker's
 
00:16:50.749 --> 00:16:50.759 align:start position:0%
office uh in whether it's the speaker or
 
00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:52.380 align:start position:0%
the deputy that's signing bills right
 
00:16:55.249 --> 00:16:55.259 align:start position:0%
from the get-go and we could we're gonna
 
00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
Circle back to that in a minute but
 
00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:00.420 align:start position:0%
those the right right out the gate that
 
00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:02.940 align:start position:0%
is a is a huge thing that that will you
 
00:17:04.549 --> 00:17:04.559 align:start position:0%
know sort of be that that red alert
 
00:17:04.559 --> 00:17:05.449 align:start position:0%
know sort of be that that red alert
button

00:17:05.449 --> 00:17:05.459 align:start position:0%
button
 
00:17:08.809 --> 00:17:08.819 align:start position:0%
um that we we have knowledge of so uh
 
00:17:11.329 --> 00:17:11.339 align:start position:0%
and Anne has uh this this bullet here
 
00:17:14.210 --> 00:17:14.220 align:start position:0%
this consider HCS study profile
 
00:17:26.809 --> 00:17:26.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:29.220 align:start position:0%
I'll just stand up it's probably easier
 
00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:32.820 align:start position:0%
um so what this is is a plan we just
 
00:17:34.130 --> 00:17:34.140 align:start position:0%
came up with this on Friday afternoon
 
00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:36.380 align:start position:0%
that our office will
 
00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
submit when a bill that is a study
 
00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:43.320 align:start position:0%
commission comes to our to our knowledge
 
00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:45.720 align:start position:0%
we're going to be proactive and create
 
00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
you you all have a copy of it and create
 
00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:50.100 align:start position:0%
this document like we're known for our
 
00:17:52.669 --> 00:17:52.679 align:start position:0%
side by sides this would be on
 
00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
oh I have them oh sorry
 
00:17:56.690 --> 00:17:56.700 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:58.850 align:start position:0%
thank you
thank you

00:17:58.850 --> 00:17:58.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:02.390 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:03.470 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:03.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:18:05.029 --> 00:18:05.039 align:start position:0%
sorry about that everyone
 
00:18:08.029 --> 00:18:08.039 align:start position:0%
um so this will be
 
00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
um a standard questionnaire that
 
00:18:13.789 --> 00:18:13.799 align:start position:0%
uh our standard document I should say
 
00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:16.500 align:start position:0%
that we prepare for the committee and we
 
00:18:20.570 --> 00:18:20.580 align:start position:0%
will do research with the um sponsors of
 
00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:23.640 align:start position:0%
the bill to find out whether the
 
00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
commission is established through
 
00:18:27.409 --> 00:18:27.419 align:start position:0%
introduction or an amendment
 
00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:30.360 align:start position:0%
or if um make sure that it and see if we
 
00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
can have a purpose statement provided by
 
00:18:34.909 --> 00:18:34.919 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor as to why the
 
00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:37.320 align:start position:0%
commission is necessary does the bill
 
00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:41.460 align:start position:0%
comply with RSA 1449
 
00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
um has you can see you can read through
 
00:18:45.169 --> 00:18:45.179 align:start position:0%
Singh has it we had a legislative study
 
00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:47.340 align:start position:0%
committee or Commission in the last five
 
00:18:49.909 --> 00:18:49.919 align:start position:0%
years why is it additional study
 
00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
necessary is there a current study that
 
00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:55.020 align:start position:0%
could be amended to include this charge
 
00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:56.520 align:start position:0%
um if there are appointing authorities
 
00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:58.029 align:start position:0%
um if there are appointing authorities
for

00:18:58.029 --> 00:18:58.039 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:01.380 align:start position:0%
non-legislative members and um if the
 
00:19:03.169 --> 00:19:03.179 align:start position:0%
non-legislative member appointees have
 
00:19:06.169 --> 00:19:06.179 align:start position:0%
been contacted or willing to participate
 
00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:08.280 align:start position:0%
so these were items that we had
 
00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:10.020 align:start position:0%
suggested to be in a questionnaire
 
00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
within OLS and that's what David Dave
 
00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:14.820 align:start position:0%
and I are talking about I'm seeing if
 
00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:16.980 align:start position:0%
that's one place where we could initiate
 
00:19:19.549 --> 00:19:19.559 align:start position:0%
these questions however when OLS gets
 
00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
that information it must be confidential
 
00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:23.700 align:start position:0%
but we might be able to find a way that
 
00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:25.740 align:start position:0%
they could share that with us if it was
 
00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:28.020 align:start position:0%
specifically requested that comes back
 
00:19:30.529 --> 00:19:30.539 align:start position:0%
to house community services and then we
 
00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
could forward on to the speaker's office
 
00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:35.460 align:start position:0%
or give it out to our chairs and if we
 
00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:37.980 align:start position:0%
can't do it there we would prepare this
 
00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:39.250 align:start position:0%
can't do it there we would prepare this
document

00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:39.260 align:start position:0%
document
 
00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:41.460 align:start position:0%
for the committee so if you're the chair
 
00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
of House Education every study
 
00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:44.700 align:start position:0%
commission that comes before you whether
 
00:19:48.650 --> 00:19:48.660 align:start position:0%
it's introduced or it is amended we
 
00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
would the researcher will proactively
 
00:19:54.049 --> 00:19:54.059 align:start position:0%
get this information for you and get it
 
00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:55.500 align:start position:0%
to the chair
 
00:19:57.169 --> 00:19:57.179 align:start position:0%
and because we want to Highlights since
 
00:19:59.510 --> 00:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
we can't do as Paul mentioned the CN
 
00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:02.220 align:start position:0%
designation this would just be one way
 
00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:05.820 align:start position:0%
for these bills to stand out to the
 
00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:08.220 align:start position:0%
committee to see that there's it's
 
00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:10.260 align:start position:0%
Unique and that it's not just a regular
 
00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
bill it has a commission a study
 
00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:16.500 align:start position:0%
commission attached to it so this is all
 
00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:19.260 align:start position:0%
just suggestions this is brainstorming
 
00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
by the staff and we thought that this
 
00:20:23.029 --> 00:20:23.039 align:start position:0%
might be a possibility to bring it
 
00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:24.660 align:start position:0%
forward it to you obviously to consider
 
00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:26.820 align:start position:0%
if this is an option
 
00:20:28.789 --> 00:20:28.799 align:start position:0%
um it wouldn't require legislation it's
 
00:20:30.169 --> 00:20:30.179 align:start position:0%
just um
 
00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:32.460 align:start position:0%
staff practices but we just thought it
 
00:20:35.409 --> 00:20:35.419 align:start position:0%
would be a helpful item for all of our
 
00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
chairman and our committee members
 
00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:41.880 align:start position:0%
uh let me ask the committee would uh
 
00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
would you consider it worthwhile to have
 
00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:47.940 align:start position:0%
an additional question on here something
 
00:20:51.409 --> 00:20:51.419 align:start position:0%
like uh as this
 
00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:53.640 align:start position:0%
posed committee or commission been
 
00:20:59.090 --> 00:20:59.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:01.380 align:start position:0%
so that so that coming coming through
 
00:21:05.029 --> 00:21:05.039 align:start position:0%
whether it's been endorsed by by the two
 
00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:07.320 align:start position:0%
leadership our research is always
 
00:21:09.650 --> 00:21:09.660 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan so that's not a role that we
 
00:21:10.850 --> 00:21:10.860 align:start position:0%
would take out I think it's a different
 
00:21:12.650 --> 00:21:12.660 align:start position:0%
discussion you'd have to have this is
 
00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:19.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:22.380 align:start position:0%
so much for doing all this work
 
00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:22.909 align:start position:0%
so much for doing all this work
um

00:21:22.909 --> 00:21:22.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:24.890 --> 00:21:24.900 align:start position:0%
so I was just thinking about the whole
 
00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:27.660 align:start position:0%
issue of bills being private when
 
00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:29.820 align:start position:0%
they're formed and of course this I mean
 
00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:31.500 align:start position:0%
when they're filed and of course the
 
00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:34.980 align:start position:0%
subject matter is necessarily private
 
00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
but these are just really like
 
00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:39.480 align:start position:0%
procedural questions
 
00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:42.200 align:start position:0%
you know so if you're concerned about
 
00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
releasing the information during the
 
00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:47.640 align:start position:0%
drafting process you know it's just like
 
00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:50.100 align:start position:0%
has the appointing authority been
 
00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:52.740 align:start position:0%
identified I mean it's not like you're
 
00:21:56.690 --> 00:21:56.700 align:start position:0%
giving any great substantive issue about
 
00:21:59.510 --> 00:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
the bill away
 
00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
right I mean it's kind of just details
 
00:22:08.029 --> 00:22:08.039 align:start position:0%
and I know this is an area where Dave
 
00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:09.480 align:start position:0%
and I might have a little bit of a
 
00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:11.400 align:start position:0%
disagreement I certainly respect their
 
00:22:13.789 --> 00:22:13.799 align:start position:0%
you know the fact that they want to
 
00:22:15.169 --> 00:22:15.179 align:start position:0%
maintain confidentiality with the
 
00:22:17.029 --> 00:22:17.039 align:start position:0%
members particularly during Drafting and
 
00:22:18.529 --> 00:22:18.539 align:start position:0%
there's a legitimate reason for doing
 
00:22:18.539 --> 00:22:19.430 align:start position:0%
there's a legitimate reason for doing
that

00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:22:21.409 --> 00:22:21.419 align:start position:0%
however um as you know representative
 
00:22:22.549 --> 00:22:22.559 align:start position:0%
evil uh
 
00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:24.900 align:start position:0%
the privilege belongs to the client and
 
00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:25.610 align:start position:0%
the privilege belongs to the client and
there's

00:22:25.610 --> 00:22:25.620 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:22:27.890 --> 00:22:27.900 align:start position:0%
in my mind there's nothing that uh we
 
00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:29.340 align:start position:0%
couldn't do that if if it's a
 
00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
questionnaire or a way some sort of
 
00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:33.240 align:start position:0%
waiver on behalf of the member if
 
00:22:35.090 --> 00:22:35.100 align:start position:0%
particularly for study committees if
 
00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:37.140 align:start position:0%
they wanted to have this information
 
00:22:39.049 --> 00:22:39.059 align:start position:0%
made available to others the member
 
00:22:40.789 --> 00:22:40.799 align:start position:0%
could waive that or they could be put on
 
00:22:40.799 --> 00:22:42.409 align:start position:0%
could waive that or they could be put on
notice

00:22:42.409 --> 00:22:42.419 align:start position:0%
notice
 
00:22:44.810 --> 00:22:44.820 align:start position:0%
um as an option I'm not suggesting they
 
00:22:45.890 --> 00:22:45.900 align:start position:0%
would be waiving their entire
 
00:22:47.870 --> 00:22:47.880 align:start position:0%
confidentiality or even the substance of
 
00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:50.100 align:start position:0%
the bill but those specific questions
 
00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:51.720 align:start position:0%
you're talking about some of which would
 
00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:53.340 align:start position:0%
be included in here some of which we
 
00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:55.440 align:start position:0%
considered for the questionnaire
 
00:22:57.110 --> 00:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
um I think we could certainly work on
 
00:22:58.310 --> 00:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
that issue I don't think the
 
00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:00.780 align:start position:0%
confidentiality issue is uh it's not
 
00:23:03.529 --> 00:23:03.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:05.810 --> 00:23:05.820 align:start position:0%
well I mean I that's what I was just
 
00:23:07.909 --> 00:23:07.919 align:start position:0%
wondering where the confidentiality
 
00:23:10.669 --> 00:23:10.679 align:start position:0%
requirement came from I mean the big
 
00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:13.080 align:start position:0%
hurdle I would think for somebody who is
 
00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:14.820 align:start position:0%
filing a bill is whether they're filing
 
00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:17.400 align:start position:0%
the bill at all and whether they want
 
00:23:19.370 --> 00:23:19.380 align:start position:0%
people to know that
 
00:23:22.909 --> 00:23:22.919 align:start position:0%
um but none of this really uh gets I
 
00:23:25.250 --> 00:23:25.260 align:start position:0%
that I can see gets to the substantive
 
00:23:28.190 --> 00:23:28.200 align:start position:0%
nature of the bill it's more just the
 
00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
details of the bill and if it is really
 
00:23:35.810 --> 00:23:35.820 align:start position:0%
helpful in moving the process along I
 
00:23:40.549 --> 00:23:40.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:42.649 --> 00:23:42.659 align:start position:0%
Dave a question concerning
 
00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
confidentiality that goes back to a
 
00:23:46.970 --> 00:23:46.980 align:start position:0%
superior court case many many years ago
 
00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:50.460 align:start position:0%
when outside bodies
 
00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
individuals were seeking all the
 
00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
information about how bills were filed
 
00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
what was being presented by members and
 
00:23:59.690 --> 00:23:59.700 align:start position:0%
so that is when the Court ruled that
 
00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:02.840 align:start position:0%
this information that we receive is is
 
00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
confidential yes remember Kenway can
 
00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
wave it uh certainly if you want if any
 
00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:11.280 align:start position:0%
member wants to bring in uh an outside
 
00:24:15.409 --> 00:24:15.419 align:start position:0%
expert or agency or lobbyist they can
 
00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:18.360 align:start position:0%
that certainly kind of opens up a good
 
00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
part of things but that is that's the
 
00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:23.880 align:start position:0%
origins and we try to keep a tight tight
 
00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
lid on that but certainly uh
 
00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:29.580 align:start position:0%
we can look at a prices that would
 
00:24:31.909 --> 00:24:31.919 align:start position:0%
have a waiver for that that this
 
00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:34.260 align:start position:0%
particular type of information so so
 
00:24:36.529 --> 00:24:36.539 align:start position:0%
according to that stretching back to
 
00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:39.780 align:start position:0%
that Superior Court ruling is the the
 
00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
filing of the bill is it privilege
 
00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:44.880 align:start position:0%
attorney client privileged
 
00:24:47.149 --> 00:24:47.159 align:start position:0%
yes it's uh the information and all the
 
00:24:49.909 --> 00:24:49.919 align:start position:0%
information that is uh that is there now
 
00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:52.500 align:start position:0%
certainly in the house as soon as that
 
00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
LSR is is entered and we give it a
 
00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:56.210 align:start position:0%
LSR is is entered and we give it a
number

00:24:56.210 --> 00:24:56.220 align:start position:0%
number
 
00:24:59.690 --> 00:24:59.700 align:start position:0%
that that current title at that point is
 
00:25:02.029 --> 00:25:02.039 align:start position:0%
put on the website so that and only that
 
00:25:05.570 --> 00:25:05.580 align:start position:0%
is made public so these the sponsor and
 
00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:08.100 align:start position:0%
that working title is is made public all
 
00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
the other information that comes in is
 
00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:12.840 align:start position:0%
is is confidential
 
00:25:15.289 --> 00:25:15.299 align:start position:0%
in the Senate of course the requesting
 
00:25:20.029 --> 00:25:20.039 align:start position:0%
member can ask uh that the LSR title
 
00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:22.020 align:start position:0%
be uh be
 
00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
not disclosed and so if we look at the
 
00:25:27.769 --> 00:25:27.779 align:start position:0%
LSR numbering uh you'll see many cases
 
00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:29.460 align:start position:0%
that the numbers are missing and those
 
00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:33.480 align:start position:0%
are most likely uh lsrs that kept
 
00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
confidential in the Senate are the
 
00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
sponsors and co-sponsors in the Senate
 
00:25:40.909 --> 00:25:40.919 align:start position:0%
no they the the nothing is listed until
 
00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
the bill actually becomes uh introduced
 
00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:45.960 align:start position:0%
in the Senate
 
00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:48.769 align:start position:0%
in the Senate
interesting

00:25:48.769 --> 00:25:48.779 align:start position:0%
interesting
 
00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
any other any questions yes it can so
 
00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to think through
 
00:25:57.230 --> 00:25:57.240 align:start position:0%
why is it more helpful to have this
 
00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:00.360 align:start position:0%
information Before the bill is actually
 
00:26:03.529 --> 00:26:03.539 align:start position:0%
issued the text I'm just trying to think
 
00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:05.820 align:start position:0%
think about the time you definitely want
 
00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:08.400 align:start position:0%
this information I think provided to the
 
00:26:11.269 --> 00:26:11.279 align:start position:0%
standing committees once the bill is
 
00:26:14.210 --> 00:26:14.220 align:start position:0%
official and numbered and all that sort
 
00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:16.200 align:start position:0%
of thing
 
00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:18.120 align:start position:0%
um I think the reason why we initially
 
00:26:20.269 --> 00:26:20.279 align:start position:0%
thought of this at that point was that
 
00:26:21.769 --> 00:26:21.779 align:start position:0%
as a drafter is collecting the
 
00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
information from the sponsor on the LSR
 
00:26:27.769 --> 00:26:27.779 align:start position:0%
they could say have you done research to
 
00:26:31.789 --> 00:26:31.799 align:start position:0%
see has this when was the study last or
 
00:26:33.409 --> 00:26:33.419 align:start position:0%
what what information have you done
 
00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
research because as we've stated earlier
 
00:26:37.669 --> 00:26:37.679 align:start position:0%
we do know that there are some sponsors
 
00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
who want an issue researched and they
 
00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:41.640 align:start position:0%
believe that a commission is the vehicle
 
00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:44.400 align:start position:0%
for that as opposed to turning to OLS
 
00:26:47.810 --> 00:26:47.820 align:start position:0%
research or or our office if it's a full
 
00:26:49.970 --> 00:26:49.980 align:start position:0%
committee so that's why at that point of
 
00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
entry we were hoping and we did hear
 
00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
from some members who have said oh I had
 
00:26:56.090 --> 00:26:56.100 align:start position:0%
no idea that there was a study I mean
 
00:26:57.710 --> 00:26:57.720 align:start position:0%
granted everything I can share will be
 
00:27:02.029 --> 00:27:02.039 align:start position:0%
so anecdotal but it just uh highlights
 
00:27:04.010 --> 00:27:04.020 align:start position:0%
that we thought maybe that point of
 
00:27:05.930 --> 00:27:05.940 align:start position:0%
entry would help and would cut down on
 
00:27:09.529 --> 00:27:09.539 align:start position:0%
some of them if they knew that um a
 
00:27:11.149 --> 00:27:11.159 align:start position:0%
study Commission on marijuana was
 
00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:13.320 align:start position:0%
completed just a year ago and and now
 
00:27:15.950 --> 00:27:15.960 align:start position:0%
something's been recreated so that's why
 
00:27:18.649 --> 00:27:18.659 align:start position:0%
but if that's not possible due to
 
00:27:20.810 --> 00:27:20.820 align:start position:0%
confidentiality issues that possibly
 
00:27:22.549 --> 00:27:22.559 align:start position:0%
that's we're going to explore some other
 
00:27:25.370 --> 00:27:25.380 align:start position:0%
options but we thought this this would
 
00:27:27.409 --> 00:27:27.419 align:start position:0%
be part way through system and also we
 
00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:28.860 align:start position:0%
did find out
 
00:27:30.649 --> 00:27:30.659 align:start position:0%
um that a good number of commissions are
 
00:27:32.210 --> 00:27:32.220 align:start position:0%
created through through the amendment
 
00:27:34.549 --> 00:27:34.559 align:start position:0%
process so that's another reason why we
 
00:27:36.049 --> 00:27:36.059 align:start position:0%
thought it might make sense to do it
 
00:27:39.010 --> 00:27:39.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:41.450 --> 00:27:41.460 align:start position:0%
I was just trying to figure out
 
00:27:43.850 --> 00:27:43.860 align:start position:0%
when you were thinking you'd give it to
 
00:27:46.610 --> 00:27:46.620 align:start position:0%
the standing committees if the bill
 
00:27:49.850 --> 00:27:49.860 align:start position:0%
wasn't actually introduced yet or what
 
00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
the is is that it would be once the
 
00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:54.600 align:start position:0%
Bill's introduced that's right yeah the
 
00:27:58.250 --> 00:27:58.260 align:start position:0%
way it said draft I thought you meant
 
00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
that makes it easier for me
 
00:28:03.049 --> 00:28:03.059 align:start position:0%
I was thinking that would be that's it
 
00:28:05.570 --> 00:28:05.580 align:start position:0%
that's clear it says draft because we
 
00:28:07.789 --> 00:28:07.799 align:start position:0%
didn't want to make any assumptions we
 
00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:09.480 align:start position:0%
were just proposing this idea we're
 
00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
calling the paper a draft not the draft
 
00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.400 align:start position:0%
calling the paper a draft not the draft
LSA

um Matt

00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
um Matt
 
00:28:26.510 --> 00:28:26.520 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the work that you put
 
00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
into this I'm curious if you've thought
 
00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:30.720 align:start position:0%
at all about how this would apply to
 
00:28:32.810 --> 00:28:32.820 align:start position:0%
Senate bills when they come over we're
 
00:28:33.950 --> 00:28:33.960 align:start position:0%
going to talk about that in just a
 
00:28:38.390 --> 00:28:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:40.010 --> 00:28:40.020 align:start position:0%
go on
 
00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:41.269 align:start position:0%
go on
okay

00:28:41.269 --> 00:28:41.279 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:28:41.279 --> 00:28:43.130 align:start position:0%
okay
great

00:28:43.130 --> 00:28:43.140 align:start position:0%
great
 
00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:44.700 align:start position:0%
um so uh
 
00:28:47.630 --> 00:28:47.640 align:start position:0%
additionally uh we we did discuss
 
00:28:49.970 --> 00:28:49.980 align:start position:0%
um there have been some suggestion and I
 
00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
know it's come up in the past about
 
00:28:53.210 --> 00:28:53.220 align:start position:0%
sending uh commissions to a second
 
00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:54.900 align:start position:0%
committee and
 
00:28:56.810 --> 00:28:56.820 align:start position:0%
um what I what I stressed at that
 
00:28:56.820 --> 00:28:57.769 align:start position:0%
um what I what I stressed at that
meeting

00:28:57.769 --> 00:28:57.779 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
00:29:00.409 --> 00:29:00.419 align:start position:0%
um and was that
 
00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
we have a staggering amount of of second
 
00:29:07.010 --> 00:29:07.020 align:start position:0%
committee bills and um for those of you
 
00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
on the rules committee you also know
 
00:29:10.370 --> 00:29:10.380 align:start position:0%
that there's a discussion every other
 
00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:13.200 align:start position:0%
year as well about is there enough time
 
00:29:15.470 --> 00:29:15.480 align:start position:0%
uh for us to act on those second
 
00:29:18.850 --> 00:29:18.860 align:start position:0%
committee bills and um because
 
00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
historically what's happened on a lot of
 
00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
those second committee bills is they're
 
00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
usually the last ones to come in uh so
 
00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
we we are usually dealing with a with a
 
00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:30.240 align:start position:0%
truncated amount of time and so rather
 
00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:33.480 align:start position:0%
than than creating a requirement where
 
00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:35.640 align:start position:0%
um all study commissions or committees
 
00:29:37.690 --> 00:29:37.700 align:start position:0%
will go to a second committee for review
 
00:29:40.010 --> 00:29:40.020 align:start position:0%
one of the thoughts was that we could
 
00:29:42.169 --> 00:29:42.179 align:start position:0%
create a new standing committee that
 
00:29:45.289 --> 00:29:45.299 align:start position:0%
deals exclusively with it or we could
 
00:29:47.690 --> 00:29:47.700 align:start position:0%
amend the charge of one of the current
 
00:29:50.450 --> 00:29:50.460 align:start position:0%
standing committees to be the repository
 
00:29:54.169 --> 00:29:54.179 align:start position:0%
for all studies and I know uh we've
 
00:29:55.970 --> 00:29:55.980 align:start position:0%
discussed in the past uh representative
 
00:29:59.090 --> 00:29:59.100 align:start position:0%
evil it rules uh uh two terms ago where
 
00:30:00.409 --> 00:30:00.419 align:start position:0%
legislative Administration could
 
00:30:03.409 --> 00:30:03.419 align:start position:0%
possibly be the committee that houses
 
00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
those but
 
00:30:08.450 --> 00:30:08.460 align:start position:0%
um in in either in either way that is
 
00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
that would be sort of a rules change
 
00:30:12.409 --> 00:30:12.419 align:start position:0%
where we would create a new committee or
 
00:30:13.970 --> 00:30:13.980 align:start position:0%
amend the charge of one of the
 
00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
Committees and designate that all of
 
00:30:18.889 --> 00:30:18.899 align:start position:0%
those bills go to that committee for the
 
00:30:21.769 --> 00:30:21.779 align:start position:0%
hearing process now I understand
 
00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
um in that process that it does take
 
00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
away sort of the policy element in that
 
00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:29.090 align:start position:0%
away sort of the policy element in that
regard

00:30:29.090 --> 00:30:29.100 align:start position:0%
regard
 
00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:29.870 align:start position:0%
regard
um

00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:32.269 align:start position:0%
um
but

00:30:32.269 --> 00:30:32.279 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:30:34.549 --> 00:30:34.559 align:start position:0%
we're we're up against the wall so to
 
00:30:35.570 --> 00:30:35.580 align:start position:0%
speak right
 
00:30:38.930 --> 00:30:38.940 align:start position:0%
um the the question is if if there's a
 
00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
list like like and just uh suggested
 
00:30:43.130 --> 00:30:43.140 align:start position:0%
there that
 
00:30:45.529 --> 00:30:45.539 align:start position:0%
um you know each each standing committee
 
00:30:47.269 --> 00:30:47.279 align:start position:0%
is still going to deal with with these
 
00:30:49.070 --> 00:30:49.080 align:start position:0%
commissions and committees
 
00:30:51.289 --> 00:30:51.299 align:start position:0%
um then then perhaps that that's a good
 
00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:54.480 align:start position:0%
way to winnow it down uh the the reality
 
00:30:55.850 --> 00:30:55.860 align:start position:0%
is that we
 
00:30:58.190 --> 00:30:58.200 align:start position:0%
we we have a lot of these bills that
 
00:31:01.370 --> 00:31:01.380 align:start position:0%
come at us and um
 
00:31:03.769 --> 00:31:03.779 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's it's it's easier just to
 
00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:05.640 align:start position:0%
look at it and say oh well it's just a
 
00:31:07.490 --> 00:31:07.500 align:start position:0%
commission let's easy
 
00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
hearing exec get it out of here
 
00:31:13.669 --> 00:31:13.679 align:start position:0%
um but the reality is does it comply
 
00:31:16.669 --> 00:31:16.679 align:start position:0%
with our new 1449 does it
 
00:31:19.190 --> 00:31:19.200 align:start position:0%
um does it have is this actually a
 
00:31:21.529 --> 00:31:21.539 align:start position:0%
legislative study committee or
 
00:31:21.539 --> 00:31:22.730 align:start position:0%
legislative study committee or
commission

00:31:22.730 --> 00:31:22.740 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:31:24.470 --> 00:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
um and and trust me I've been having a
 
00:31:26.029 --> 00:31:26.039 align:start position:0%
lot of conversations with some members
 
00:31:29.570 --> 00:31:29.580 align:start position:0%
recently about is this a this we have
 
00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:31.320 align:start position:0%
this commission that exists the the
 
00:31:35.090 --> 00:31:35.100 align:start position:0%
opioid abatement fund uh is is a perfect
 
00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:37.080 align:start position:0%
example of this
 
00:31:39.769 --> 00:31:39.779 align:start position:0%
um a member has been repeatedly asking
 
00:31:41.450 --> 00:31:41.460 align:start position:0%
me questions about it and I said this is
 
00:31:44.810 --> 00:31:44.820 align:start position:0%
not a legislative study commission as
 
00:31:48.529 --> 00:31:48.539 align:start position:0%
defined by RSA 1449 and and then it was
 
00:31:51.169 --> 00:31:51.179 align:start position:0%
like finally a light bulb went off
 
00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
um but but the reality is that
 
00:31:55.669 --> 00:31:55.679 align:start position:0%
some of these things do get sort of
 
00:31:57.889 --> 00:31:57.899 align:start position:0%
policy heavy and and the and the policy
 
00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:00.240 align:start position:0%
committees might want to have that
 
00:32:04.010 --> 00:32:04.020 align:start position:0%
oversight but if you want sort of a
 
00:32:05.450 --> 00:32:05.460 align:start position:0%
winnowing Down
 
00:32:07.370 --> 00:32:07.380 align:start position:0%
and and that's that's the political
 
00:32:08.930 --> 00:32:08.940 align:start position:0%
question here do you want to winnow
 
00:32:11.029 --> 00:32:11.039 align:start position:0%
these things down or do we want to
 
00:32:14.210 --> 00:32:14.220 align:start position:0%
really just create a more formalized
 
00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:15.830 align:start position:0%
really just create a more formalized
mechanism

00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
mechanism
 
00:32:17.510 --> 00:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
um I thought that what we did last year
 
00:32:20.990 --> 00:32:21.000 align:start position:0%
with 1449 was a very very good positive
 
00:32:23.570 --> 00:32:23.580 align:start position:0%
movement and I've defended that several
 
00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:25.620 align:start position:0%
times in including in legislative
 
00:32:27.529 --> 00:32:27.539 align:start position:0%
Administration where they just retained
 
00:32:29.690 --> 00:32:29.700 align:start position:0%
SB 84
 
00:32:32.570 --> 00:32:32.580 align:start position:0%
um so those are those are uh that's
 
00:32:34.250 --> 00:32:34.260 align:start position:0%
where your suggestions and discussion
 
00:32:36.470 --> 00:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
here are are going to be important
 
00:32:38.029 --> 00:32:38.039 align:start position:0%
um and with
 
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
specifically answering this question if
 
00:32:42.409 --> 00:32:42.419 align:start position:0%
you want to take this question up
 
00:32:42.419 --> 00:32:43.930 align:start position:0%
you want to take this question up
any

00:32:43.930 --> 00:32:43.940 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:47.640 align:start position:0%
what does what's the impact of what
 
00:32:49.549 --> 00:32:49.559 align:start position:0%
we're starting to see now with language
 
00:32:51.409 --> 00:32:51.419 align:start position:0%
coming from the Senate where it says
 
00:32:54.110 --> 00:32:54.120 align:start position:0%
1449 notwithstanding
 
00:32:56.330 --> 00:32:56.340 align:start position:0%
okay so let's move on to the next uh so
 
00:32:58.190 --> 00:32:58.200 align:start position:0%
we can we can address that a little bit
 
00:33:02.690 --> 00:33:02.700 align:start position:0%
more specifically so uh Jim and and uh I
 
00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:05.460 align:start position:0%
worked on a little bit of rule language
 
00:33:08.210 --> 00:33:08.220 align:start position:0%
um so I'm gonna pass a long
 
00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:09.110 align:start position:0%
um so I'm gonna pass a long
um

00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:13.669 --> 00:33:13.679 align:start position:0%
some a draft proposal here uh
 
00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:25.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:28.789 --> 00:33:28.799 align:start position:0%
now uh we all we all know that uh um
 
00:33:31.789 --> 00:33:31.799 align:start position:0%
I will never uh besmirch the the body on
 
00:33:33.889 --> 00:33:33.899 align:start position:0%
the other side of the wall that being
 
00:33:36.409 --> 00:33:36.419 align:start position:0%
said you all are aware that of of their
 
00:33:38.690 --> 00:33:38.700 align:start position:0%
concurrent resolution rule correct that
 
00:33:40.370 --> 00:33:40.380 align:start position:0%
they won't take concurrent resolutions
 
00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
unless they suspend their rules and and
 
00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:46.200 align:start position:0%
agree to to introduce it well that's
 
00:33:48.529 --> 00:33:48.539 align:start position:0%
sort of uh uh was the the thought
 
00:33:51.289 --> 00:33:51.299 align:start position:0%
process here on um
 
00:33:51.299 --> 00:33:52.970 align:start position:0%
process here on um
potentially

00:33:52.970 --> 00:33:52.980 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
00:33:56.690 --> 00:33:56.700 align:start position:0%
addressing a similar a similarly
 
00:33:59.389 --> 00:33:59.399 align:start position:0%
concerning issue on our side and that is
 
00:34:01.970 --> 00:34:01.980 align:start position:0%
uh so the proposed language is no biller
 
00:34:03.769 --> 00:34:03.779 align:start position:0%
amendment to any bill which either
 
00:34:05.930 --> 00:34:05.940 align:start position:0%
establishes or amends any study
 
00:34:07.250 --> 00:34:07.260 align:start position:0%
committee or commission shall be
 
00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
introduced or considered by the house
 
00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:10.200 align:start position:0%
which does not comply with the
 
00:34:14.629 --> 00:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
provisions of house rules or statutes so
 
00:34:17.149 --> 00:34:17.159 align:start position:0%
um I want to be very specific here last
 
00:34:21.310 --> 00:34:21.320 align:start position:0%
week you all heard that the Senate uh
 
00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
amended a study a new study Commission
 
00:34:29.930 --> 00:34:29.940 align:start position:0%
on regarding uh marijuana being run as a
 
00:34:31.970 --> 00:34:31.980 align:start position:0%
state-owned thing or a state operated
 
00:34:34.849 --> 00:34:34.859 align:start position:0%
thing now the this amendment was not
 
00:34:34.859 --> 00:34:35.930 align:start position:0%
thing now the this amendment was not
crafted

00:34:35.930 --> 00:34:35.940 align:start position:0%
crafted
 
00:34:37.970 --> 00:34:37.980 align:start position:0%
stating notwithstanding
 
00:34:41.570 --> 00:34:41.580 align:start position:0%
and in fact has a majority of outside
 
00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:45.720 align:start position:0%
folks uh as the decision makers so this
 
00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:50.520 align:start position:0%
clearly doesn't jive with RSA 1449 so
 
00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
when it comes over if this rule were
 
00:34:57.410 --> 00:34:57.420 align:start position:0%
here now we would take a vote whether or
 
00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:00.720 align:start position:0%
not to even consider introducing it
 
00:35:03.349 --> 00:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
um similar to what we've done in the
 
00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
past if something has been indefinitely
 
00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:06.410 align:start position:0%
past if something has been indefinitely
postponed

00:35:06.410 --> 00:35:06.420 align:start position:0%
postponed
 
00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
um we we put the body we put the
 
00:35:10.970 --> 00:35:10.980 align:start position:0%
question to the body as a whole as to
 
00:35:12.109 --> 00:35:12.119 align:start position:0%
whether or not to introduce it because
 
00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
usually we just introduce uh in recess
 
00:35:18.109 --> 00:35:18.119 align:start position:0%
without any type of issue so this would
 
00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
sort of address the 1449 issue
 
00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:23.329 align:start position:0%
sort of address the 1449 issue
um

00:35:23.329 --> 00:35:23.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:25.250 --> 00:35:25.260 align:start position:0%
not saying that this is the beyond all
 
00:35:27.530 --> 00:35:27.540 align:start position:0%
but it is a suggestion
 
00:35:30.829 --> 00:35:30.839 align:start position:0%
um as to uh something that we might want
 
00:35:34.069 --> 00:35:34.079 align:start position:0%
to consider to try to assist in that
 
00:35:34.079 --> 00:35:36.430 align:start position:0%
to consider to try to assist in that
regard

00:35:36.430 --> 00:35:36.440 align:start position:0%
regard
 
00:35:40.609 --> 00:35:40.619 align:start position:0%
yeah and just to add a little bit um I
 
00:35:42.589 --> 00:35:42.599 align:start position:0%
think part of it is resolving whatever
 
00:35:44.569 --> 00:35:44.579 align:start position:0%
issues you know may arise in the Senate
 
00:35:46.370 --> 00:35:46.380 align:start position:0%
whether it's the notwithstanding or this
 
00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
amendment which we just learned about
 
00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:50.640 align:start position:0%
last week that violates 1449 it doesn't
 
00:35:52.010 --> 00:35:52.020 align:start position:0%
even have the notwithstanding language
 
00:35:54.650 --> 00:35:54.660 align:start position:0%
but it also I think alleviates some of
 
00:35:57.470 --> 00:35:57.480 align:start position:0%
the pressure that OLS deals with in the
 
00:35:59.450 --> 00:35:59.460 align:start position:0%
sense that certainly they can advise and
 
00:36:01.130 --> 00:36:01.140 align:start position:0%
they try to make the members aware of
 
00:36:04.190 --> 00:36:04.200 align:start position:0%
1449 but if they are sort of being told
 
00:36:06.530 --> 00:36:06.540 align:start position:0%
this is what I want I want a majority of
 
00:36:08.569 --> 00:36:08.579 align:start position:0%
outside members and either use
 
00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:11.160 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding or don't
 
00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
um it's within the purview of the house
 
00:36:14.930 --> 00:36:14.940 align:start position:0%
much like the Senate has their own rules
 
00:36:16.670 --> 00:36:16.680 align:start position:0%
to determine what we're going to
 
00:36:18.890 --> 00:36:18.900 align:start position:0%
consider and I think again obviously
 
00:36:20.450 --> 00:36:20.460 align:start position:0%
this is within your discretion in
 
00:36:22.910 --> 00:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
amending house rules but I'd say a good
 
00:36:25.490 --> 00:36:25.500 align:start position:0%
place to start is making sure that our
 
00:36:27.109 --> 00:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
processes what we consider are compliant
 
00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:30.240 align:start position:0%
with the law and 1449 is the law and
 
00:36:33.109 --> 00:36:33.119 align:start position:0%
I think in this limited aspect it makes
 
00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
some sense to have a rule which says
 
00:36:37.250 --> 00:36:37.260 align:start position:0%
we're only going to consider those bills
 
00:36:39.170 --> 00:36:39.180 align:start position:0%
which comply with the law
 
00:36:41.450 --> 00:36:41.460 align:start position:0%
what happens to those
 
00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
uh rules that is it some pushback to the
 
00:36:46.910 --> 00:36:46.920 align:start position:0%
Senate saying that that this doesn't uh
 
00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
comply with our rules and therefore they
 
00:36:50.990 --> 00:36:51.000 align:start position:0%
have to start over again or what so so
 
00:36:52.970 --> 00:36:52.980 align:start position:0%
in that case what would happen
 
00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
um similar to uh what happens when we
 
00:36:57.710 --> 00:36:57.720 align:start position:0%
pass a concurrent resolution or
 
00:36:59.569 --> 00:36:59.579 align:start position:0%
something along those lines
 
00:37:02.030 --> 00:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
um we send messages with those bills to
 
00:37:04.010 --> 00:37:04.020 align:start position:0%
the Senate uh what would happen in this
 
00:37:05.450 --> 00:37:05.460 align:start position:0%
case they would send a message back
 
00:37:07.730 --> 00:37:07.740 align:start position:0%
saying that they refused introduction uh
 
00:37:10.069 --> 00:37:10.079 align:start position:0%
pursuant to Senate rule such and such so
 
00:37:12.290 --> 00:37:12.300 align:start position:0%
that would be the same situation
 
00:37:15.170 --> 00:37:15.180 align:start position:0%
um it's it's ministerial it the the work
 
00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
is is it's all messaging and and that
 
00:37:20.450 --> 00:37:20.460 align:start position:0%
sort of thing uh so if if they sent us a
 
00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:21.349 align:start position:0%
sort of thing uh so if if they sent us a
bill

00:37:21.349 --> 00:37:21.359 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:37:25.069 --> 00:37:25.079 align:start position:0%
um they could once we returned it they
 
00:37:26.810 --> 00:37:26.820 align:start position:0%
they have I mean the Senate could do
 
00:37:28.250 --> 00:37:28.260 align:start position:0%
whatever the Senate wants but there are
 
00:37:30.530 --> 00:37:30.540 align:start position:0%
actions in which they can undo things
 
00:37:33.710 --> 00:37:33.720 align:start position:0%
that have been done so
 
00:37:35.690 --> 00:37:35.700 align:start position:0%
that's uh that's within their their
 
00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:37.970 align:start position:0%
that's uh that's within their their
powers

00:37:37.970 --> 00:37:37.980 align:start position:0%
powers
 
00:37:41.810 --> 00:37:41.820 align:start position:0%
would die or stay on the not use on the
 
00:37:45.470 --> 00:37:45.480 align:start position:0%
so it could die uh it could die in terms
 
00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:48.240 align:start position:0%
of you know just sort of existing in The
 
00:37:50.690 --> 00:37:50.700 align:start position:0%
Ether which is sometimes what happens we
 
00:37:52.790 --> 00:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
we say that you know we have a
 
00:37:55.250 --> 00:37:55.260 align:start position:0%
miscellaneous status sometimes in our in
 
00:37:57.470 --> 00:37:57.480 align:start position:0%
our our advanced search
 
00:37:59.089 --> 00:37:59.099 align:start position:0%
um that usually means the things that
 
00:38:01.730 --> 00:38:01.740 align:start position:0%
don't fit neatly into a into a specific
 
00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
uh category so in that in that situation
 
00:38:06.170 --> 00:38:06.180 align:start position:0%
that would be a miscellaneous status
 
00:38:07.490 --> 00:38:07.500 align:start position:0%
where the
 
00:38:08.810 --> 00:38:08.820 align:start position:0%
um the bill just kind of died in The
 
00:38:10.130 --> 00:38:10.140 align:start position:0%
Ether so it could come back in the
 
00:38:11.329 --> 00:38:11.339 align:start position:0%
second year
 
00:38:13.849 --> 00:38:13.859 align:start position:0%
um uh if they you know corrected it or
 
00:38:16.609 --> 00:38:16.619 align:start position:0%
as I said that they they have options
 
00:38:19.790 --> 00:38:19.800 align:start position:0%
um to undo perhaps what was done and
 
00:38:21.470 --> 00:38:21.480 align:start position:0%
then perhaps send something different
 
00:38:23.089 --> 00:38:23.099 align:start position:0%
over to us or
 
00:38:25.130 --> 00:38:25.140 align:start position:0%
rescinded the amendment and pass it down
 
00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
again and this is a discussion for you
 
00:38:36.349 --> 00:38:36.359 align:start position:0%
all to have
 
00:38:39.290 --> 00:38:39.300 align:start position:0%
um this is not I mean obviously uh you
 
00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
know we have to go to house rules
 
00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
committee uh with with any rules changes
 
00:38:45.650 --> 00:38:45.660 align:start position:0%
but but you know it is a it is a
 
00:38:49.550 --> 00:38:49.560 align:start position:0%
discussion point a starter if you will
 
00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
yes I don't I don't have a question as
 
00:38:55.550 --> 00:38:55.560 align:start position:0%
much as just a couple of comments so
 
00:38:58.250 --> 00:38:58.260 align:start position:0%
um as far as the
 
00:39:00.770 --> 00:39:00.780 align:start position:0%
as far as the issue of
 
00:39:02.210 --> 00:39:02.220 align:start position:0%
um of
 
00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
commissions and committees going to a
 
00:39:07.730 --> 00:39:07.740 align:start position:0%
separate standing committee I think that
 
00:39:10.609 --> 00:39:10.619 align:start position:0%
we really have to think hard about that
 
00:39:13.730 --> 00:39:13.740 align:start position:0%
because that basically means that the
 
00:39:16.849 --> 00:39:16.859 align:start position:0%
policy as as the clerk pointed out the
 
00:39:19.550 --> 00:39:19.560 align:start position:0%
policy piece of that won't be going to a
 
00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:21.240 align:start position:0%
policy committee it's going to be going
 
00:39:24.349 --> 00:39:24.359 align:start position:0%
to a separate committee I I think that
 
00:39:25.990 --> 00:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:39:28.310 --> 00:39:28.320 align:start position:0%
challenging I'm not sure how our
 
00:39:31.490 --> 00:39:31.500 align:start position:0%
membership would feel about that when we
 
00:39:33.530 --> 00:39:33.540 align:start position:0%
did our committee on committees one of
 
00:39:34.910 --> 00:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
the things we really thought though
 
00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
should that should go to ledge admin is
 
00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:40.800 align:start position:0%
let at ledge admin on an ad hoc basis do
 
00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
the review of the uh more more abund
 
00:39:46.910 --> 00:39:46.920 align:start position:0%
commissions that aren't real weren't
 
00:39:49.310 --> 00:39:49.320 align:start position:0%
really meeting as much you know so
 
00:39:51.230 --> 00:39:51.240 align:start position:0%
alleged admin would be the one that
 
00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
would decide whether to it would be sort
 
00:39:55.250 --> 00:39:55.260 align:start position:0%
of like what our committee on committees
 
00:39:57.770 --> 00:39:57.780 align:start position:0%
did that ledge admin would make the
 
00:40:00.349 --> 00:40:00.359 align:start position:0%
recommendation as to maybe repealing a
 
00:40:00.359 --> 00:40:01.609 align:start position:0%
recommendation as to maybe repealing a
commission

00:40:01.609 --> 00:40:01.619 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:40:01.619 --> 00:40:02.810 align:start position:0%
commission
um

00:40:02.810 --> 00:40:02.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:04.370 align:start position:0%
um
and

00:40:04.370 --> 00:40:04.380 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:40:07.310 --> 00:40:07.320 align:start position:0%
it would really work once we have our
 
00:40:09.829 --> 00:40:09.839 align:start position:0%
system in place that house committee
 
00:40:12.349 --> 00:40:12.359 align:start position:0%
Services is really tracking the
 
00:40:14.270 --> 00:40:14.280 align:start position:0%
commissions that exist and how much they
 
00:40:15.710 --> 00:40:15.720 align:start position:0%
need and all that kind of stuff they
 
00:40:18.109 --> 00:40:18.119 align:start position:0%
would have the background data that they
 
00:40:20.510 --> 00:40:20.520 align:start position:0%
could go ahead and do it on
 
00:40:23.810 --> 00:40:23.820 align:start position:0%
um as far as the idea of a house rule to
 
00:40:28.670 --> 00:40:28.680 align:start position:0%
to enforce 1449 I mean I don't think
 
00:40:30.290 --> 00:40:30.300 align:start position:0%
that there's that much that's
 
00:40:33.410 --> 00:40:33.420 align:start position:0%
particularly controversial in 1449
 
00:40:38.030 --> 00:40:38.040 align:start position:0%
except the issue of requiring that the
 
00:40:40.390 --> 00:40:40.400 align:start position:0%
legislative members of the commission
 
00:40:43.910 --> 00:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
constitute the majority of a commission
 
00:40:46.910 --> 00:40:46.920 align:start position:0%
and I mean I don't I don't know what the
 
00:40:49.130 --> 00:40:49.140 align:start position:0%
Senate is doing but I would think one of
 
00:40:52.030 --> 00:40:52.040 align:start position:0%
the things that they may be not with
 
00:40:55.069 --> 00:40:55.079 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding is the membership the
 
00:40:57.550 --> 00:40:57.560 align:start position:0%
majority membership of the com of the
 
00:41:00.650 --> 00:41:00.660 align:start position:0%
commission being legislative members and
 
00:41:02.990 --> 00:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
I understand where the idea for that
 
00:41:05.390 --> 00:41:05.400 align:start position:0%
comes from you want to give the power to
 
00:41:08.750 --> 00:41:08.760 align:start position:0%
the legislators but you know if people
 
00:41:12.050 --> 00:41:12.060 align:start position:0%
are creating a stakeholder Commission
 
00:41:16.130 --> 00:41:16.140 align:start position:0%
that part might be a hurdle so we might
 
00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
want to think about that some more
 
00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:20.930 align:start position:0%
want to think about that some more
foreign

00:41:20.930 --> 00:41:20.940 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
to representative Evil's Point uh yeah
 
00:41:25.790 --> 00:41:25.800 align:start position:0%
SB 84 definitely undoes entirely
 
00:41:28.970 --> 00:41:28.980 align:start position:0%
everything good we did in 1449 last year
 
00:41:31.430 --> 00:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
um it it it actually I mean it
 
00:41:35.450 --> 00:41:35.460 align:start position:0%
it changes the the 15 member thing to
 
00:41:38.569 --> 00:41:38.579 align:start position:0%
our actual chaptered studies which is is
 
00:41:41.210 --> 00:41:41.220 align:start position:0%
silly in and of itself to me because we
 
00:41:43.010 --> 00:41:43.020 align:start position:0%
have a hard enough time getting our our
 
00:41:46.609 --> 00:41:46.619 align:start position:0%
you know three and two or four and one
 
00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
um where the those folks actually show
 
00:41:51.589 --> 00:41:51.599 align:start position:0%
up and participate so to suggest that
 
00:41:53.810 --> 00:41:53.820 align:start position:0%
that should be 15 I thought was sort of
 
00:41:57.530 --> 00:41:57.540 align:start position:0%
silly whereas they left the commissions
 
00:42:00.650 --> 00:42:00.660 align:start position:0%
they sort of reverted back to basically
 
00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:03.000 align:start position:0%
and let's be honest we all we all know
 
00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
what the problem is here we know it's
 
00:42:07.550 --> 00:42:07.560 align:start position:0%
the 45 member commissions that are Dr
 
00:42:11.329 --> 00:42:11.339 align:start position:0%
driving the bus on legislative policy uh
 
00:42:13.250 --> 00:42:13.260 align:start position:0%
that are outside of your all's control
 
00:42:16.250 --> 00:42:16.260 align:start position:0%
and I think that that's a big concern
 
00:42:18.890 --> 00:42:18.900 align:start position:0%
for many of us here in this room and
 
00:42:21.230 --> 00:42:21.240 align:start position:0%
that is is something that SB 84
 
00:42:24.170 --> 00:42:24.180 align:start position:0%
completely reverted to and I think that
 
00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:26.640 align:start position:0%
that is sort of their policy that and I
 
00:42:28.010 --> 00:42:28.020 align:start position:0%
think that's probably a fundamental
 
00:42:29.990 --> 00:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
disagreement we have
 
00:42:32.089 --> 00:42:32.099 align:start position:0%
um with them you know know one of the
 
00:42:34.069 --> 00:42:34.079 align:start position:0%
good things that I thought did exist in
 
00:42:36.710 --> 00:42:36.720 align:start position:0%
that in that bill uh that I think we
 
00:42:39.770 --> 00:42:39.780 align:start position:0%
should look look forward to in terms of
 
00:42:42.349 --> 00:42:42.359 align:start position:0%
of operational procedures is the outside
 
00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:44.640 align:start position:0%
agencies hosting
 
00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
um those those studies uh that are
 
00:42:49.370 --> 00:42:49.380 align:start position:0%
conducted in those in those manner in
 
00:42:51.770 --> 00:42:51.780 align:start position:0%
that manner um to the point about
 
00:42:53.690 --> 00:42:53.700 align:start position:0%
legislative Administration I certainly
 
00:42:55.430 --> 00:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
agree representative people I think that
 
00:42:56.870 --> 00:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
legislative Administration has that
 
00:42:58.730 --> 00:42:58.740 align:start position:0%
power now to do that
 
00:43:00.829 --> 00:43:00.839 align:start position:0%
um the the chair has the ability to
 
00:43:00.839 --> 00:43:01.910 align:start position:0%
um the the chair has the ability to
create

00:43:01.910 --> 00:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
create
 
00:43:03.650 --> 00:43:03.660 align:start position:0%
um you know any type of subcommittee and
 
00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:06.720 align:start position:0%
and frankly the subcommittee uh pursuant
 
00:43:08.930 --> 00:43:08.940 align:start position:0%
to to the standing uh rule of
 
00:43:10.670 --> 00:43:10.680 align:start position:0%
legislative Administration can actually
 
00:43:12.170 --> 00:43:12.180 align:start position:0%
report to the full house floor without
 
00:43:13.730 --> 00:43:13.740 align:start position:0%
even having to go to the full committee
 
00:43:13.740 --> 00:43:14.750 align:start position:0%
even having to go to the full committee
so

00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:14.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:43:16.790 --> 00:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
um I do think uh we we do have that
 
00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
ability and we should perhaps gently
 
00:43:22.370 --> 00:43:22.380 align:start position:0%
nudge the committee to to maybe do that
 
00:43:24.890 --> 00:43:24.900 align:start position:0%
on a buy-in biennial basis
 
00:43:27.410 --> 00:43:27.420 align:start position:0%
um so I I definitely see your point and
 
00:43:30.349 --> 00:43:30.359 align:start position:0%
and agree and again I I
 
00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
for discussion purposes that's why we
 
00:43:35.270 --> 00:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
had the the section uh about the second
 
00:43:36.829 --> 00:43:36.839 align:start position:0%
committee versus a separate standing
 
00:43:38.510 --> 00:43:38.520 align:start position:0%
committee I tend to agree with you I
 
00:43:40.370 --> 00:43:40.380 align:start position:0%
think we don't want to necessarily take
 
00:43:43.069 --> 00:43:43.079 align:start position:0%
that that policy uh
 
00:43:45.650 --> 00:43:45.660 align:start position:0%
policy position away from from the
 
00:43:47.690 --> 00:43:47.700 align:start position:0%
decision makers um you know somebody on
 
00:43:49.730 --> 00:43:49.740 align:start position:0%
legislative Administration uh really
 
00:43:51.829 --> 00:43:51.839 align:start position:0%
doesn't probably doesn't have much
 
00:43:53.870 --> 00:43:53.880 align:start position:0%
understanding of the average Solid Waste
 
00:43:55.309 --> 00:43:55.319 align:start position:0%
working group that environment
 
00:43:58.250 --> 00:43:58.260 align:start position:0%
agriculture uh would so you know for
 
00:44:00.170 --> 00:44:00.180 align:start position:0%
that for that reason alone I I tend to
 
00:44:02.210 --> 00:44:02.220 align:start position:0%
agree with you but for for discussion
 
00:44:05.329 --> 00:44:05.339 align:start position:0%
purposes we put it to you
 
00:44:06.589 --> 00:44:06.599 align:start position:0%
yes I just
 
00:44:07.970 --> 00:44:07.980 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:44:11.089 --> 00:44:11.099 align:start position:0%
what I think our uh committee on
 
00:44:14.750 --> 00:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
committees had hoped was that the rule
 
00:44:16.609 --> 00:44:16.619 align:start position:0%
that where you establish the
 
00:44:19.609 --> 00:44:19.619 align:start position:0%
responsibilities for ledge admin we
 
00:44:22.370 --> 00:44:22.380 align:start position:0%
actually would include you know add to
 
00:44:24.890 --> 00:44:24.900 align:start position:0%
their responsibilities the requirement
 
00:44:27.890 --> 00:44:27.900 align:start position:0%
that they review periodically the
 
00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
existing commissions that was the idea
 
00:44:33.589 --> 00:44:33.599 align:start position:0%
because I I agree with you they already
 
00:44:36.650 --> 00:44:36.660 align:start position:0%
have that power but if you add to the
 
00:44:38.450 --> 00:44:38.460 align:start position:0%
rule that they have the responsibility
 
00:44:40.309 --> 00:44:40.319 align:start position:0%
to do it
 
00:44:44.510 --> 00:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
um that would be good I just I I I hope
 
00:44:46.670 --> 00:44:46.680 align:start position:0%
one of the things that comes out of this
 
00:44:49.430 --> 00:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
is that there is somebody specifically
 
00:44:53.150 --> 00:44:53.160 align:start position:0%
tasked with routinely reviewing uh the
 
00:44:55.069 --> 00:44:55.079 align:start position:0%
commissions that exist because it's too
 
00:44:57.650 --> 00:44:57.660 align:start position:0%
hard for 10 years to pass by and all of
 
00:45:00.290 --> 00:45:00.300 align:start position:0%
a sudden we're going back to the way
 
00:45:03.050 --> 00:45:03.060 align:start position:0%
well we had we have like every decade we
 
00:45:04.970 --> 00:45:04.980 align:start position:0%
review everything but if those guys
 
00:45:07.309 --> 00:45:07.319 align:start position:0%
could do it annually and with the
 
00:45:09.530 --> 00:45:09.540 align:start position:0%
updated list I think that would help a
 
00:45:12.349 --> 00:45:12.359 align:start position:0%
lot if if you'd like I'm I'm certainly
 
00:45:14.030 --> 00:45:14.040 align:start position:0%
as you know I'm happy to work with you
 
00:45:16.370 --> 00:45:16.380 align:start position:0%
on any amendments to rules um obviously
 
00:45:18.109 --> 00:45:18.119 align:start position:0%
this fall we'll need to kind of come
 
00:45:19.910 --> 00:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
back together anyway uh the rules
 
00:45:22.750 --> 00:45:22.760 align:start position:0%
committee that is for other purposes and
 
00:45:25.730 --> 00:45:25.740 align:start position:0%
presumably if if this commission if this
 
00:45:27.290 --> 00:45:27.300 align:start position:0%
committee has additional rules
 
00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:28.970 align:start position:0%
committee has additional rules
recommendations

00:45:28.970 --> 00:45:28.980 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
00:45:30.589 --> 00:45:30.599 align:start position:0%
um you know that would be good to
 
00:45:34.190 --> 00:45:34.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:36.290 --> 00:45:36.300 align:start position:0%
we have with us as both the speaker and
 
00:45:38.809 --> 00:45:38.819 align:start position:0%
a speaker Emeritus uh
 
00:45:41.210 --> 00:45:41.220 align:start position:0%
you have any comments about where the
 
00:45:44.210 --> 00:45:44.220 align:start position:0%
recommendations are or what you might
 
00:45:47.510 --> 00:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
like to see us uh focus on unless it's
 
00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:52.309 align:start position:0%
like to see us uh focus on unless it's
better

00:45:52.309 --> 00:45:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:52.319 --> 00:45:52.990 align:start position:0%
 
better

00:45:52.990 --> 00:45:53.000 align:start position:0%
better
 
00:45:56.870 --> 00:45:56.880 align:start position:0%
the solid house
 
00:45:59.030 --> 00:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
repeat what is already set my biggest
 
00:46:01.730 --> 00:46:01.740 align:start position:0%
concern about admissions issue not only
 
00:46:04.130 --> 00:46:04.140 align:start position:0%
putting stakeholders at the table we
 
00:46:06.290 --> 00:46:06.300 align:start position:0%
were actually giving them above
 
00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:15.130 align:start position:0%
were actually giving them above
responsible

00:46:15.130 --> 00:46:15.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:17.150 --> 00:46:17.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:18.470 align:start position:0%
thank you
thanks

00:46:18.470 --> 00:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
00:46:20.210 --> 00:46:20.220 align:start position:0%
we're just we're just digging in yes
 
00:46:23.210 --> 00:46:23.220 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chairman
 
00:46:25.010 --> 00:46:25.020 align:start position:0%
thank you for all of you for being here
 
00:46:28.010 --> 00:46:28.020 align:start position:0%
and telling us what you are saying
 
00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
um I wouldn't want to put the full
 
00:46:32.569 --> 00:46:32.579 align:start position:0%
responsibility with Legend men because
 
00:46:34.730 --> 00:46:34.740 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking back when we were on when I
 
00:46:37.609 --> 00:46:37.619 align:start position:0%
was on Judiciary we were quite capable
 
00:46:39.349 --> 00:46:39.359 align:start position:0%
of deciding whether something should be
 
00:46:41.150 --> 00:46:41.160 align:start position:0%
a commission or not I'm going back one
 
00:46:42.470 --> 00:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
more time to the right to know
 
00:46:44.930 --> 00:46:44.940 align:start position:0%
commission what a burden that became for
 
00:46:44.940 --> 00:46:46.430 align:start position:0%
commission what a burden that became for
everybody

00:46:46.430 --> 00:46:46.440 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:47.089 align:start position:0%
everybody
um

00:46:47.089 --> 00:46:47.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:49.430 --> 00:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
I think that committee could very well
 
00:46:51.410 --> 00:46:51.420 align:start position:0%
have said let's dissolve the right to
 
00:46:53.390 --> 00:46:53.400 align:start position:0%
know Commission because it was producing
 
00:46:55.670 --> 00:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
nothing positive for years couldn't even
 
00:46:58.010 --> 00:46:58.020 align:start position:0%
get a quorum so I wouldn't want the
 
00:47:00.410 --> 00:47:00.420 align:start position:0%
total responsibility with one committee
 
00:47:02.809 --> 00:47:02.819 align:start position:0%
I would like to believe that
 
00:47:04.190 --> 00:47:04.200 align:start position:0%
um say if something went before Health
 
00:47:06.890 --> 00:47:06.900 align:start position:0%
and Human Services for example
 
00:47:08.270 --> 00:47:08.280 align:start position:0%
um they could say whether or not that
 
00:47:10.190 --> 00:47:10.200 align:start position:0%
bill should Pass based on the
 
00:47:11.930 --> 00:47:11.940 align:start position:0%
information contained in the bill and
 
00:47:13.790 --> 00:47:13.800 align:start position:0%
what they would expect the commission to
 
00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:17.270 align:start position:0%
what they would expect the commission to
accomplish

00:47:17.270 --> 00:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:18.950 --> 00:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
thanks yes
 
00:47:21.650 --> 00:47:21.660 align:start position:0%
but in my understanding this critically
 
00:47:24.950 --> 00:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
um ledge admin would be charged with
 
00:47:28.309 --> 00:47:28.319 align:start position:0%
just once a biennium meeting with house
 
00:47:30.109 --> 00:47:30.119 align:start position:0%
committee Services going over their list
 
00:47:33.410 --> 00:47:33.420 align:start position:0%
and seeing which ones are not active and
 
00:47:36.650 --> 00:47:36.660 align:start position:0%
creating legislation to yeah I remove
 
00:47:38.750 --> 00:47:38.760 align:start position:0%
those right so it's not like
 
00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:48.950 align:start position:0%
those right so it's not like
okay

00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:51.050 --> 00:47:51.060 align:start position:0%
it would depend however the the charge
 
00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
is drafted in rules would be
 
00:47:56.630 --> 00:47:56.640 align:start position:0%
I think one of the one of the biggest
 
00:48:00.109 --> 00:48:00.119 align:start position:0%
issues we've had and and uh sure
 
00:48:02.329 --> 00:48:02.339 align:start position:0%
uh representative shirtle can read me on
 
00:48:04.309 --> 00:48:04.319 align:start position:0%
this it's finding people to serve on
 
00:48:06.650 --> 00:48:06.660 align:start position:0%
these committees and commissions and I'm
 
00:48:08.510 --> 00:48:08.520 align:start position:0%
sure you remember it was individual that
 
00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:10.069 align:start position:0%
sure you remember it was individual that
it's

00:48:10.069 --> 00:48:10.079 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:48:12.609 --> 00:48:12.619 align:start position:0%
when you've got many more than
 
00:48:16.010 --> 00:48:16.020 align:start position:0%
five and five is pushing it
 
00:48:18.290 --> 00:48:18.300 align:start position:0%
it becomes
 
00:48:20.569 --> 00:48:20.579 align:start position:0%
nearly impossible to fill all those
 
00:48:20.579 --> 00:48:21.470 align:start position:0%
nearly impossible to fill all those
seats

00:48:21.470 --> 00:48:21.480 align:start position:0%
seats
 
00:48:23.150 --> 00:48:23.160 align:start position:0%
so when you're talking about commissions
 
00:48:25.730 --> 00:48:25.740 align:start position:0%
that have maybe five reps and three
 
00:48:28.370 --> 00:48:28.380 align:start position:0%
senators or two senators and 15 other
 
00:48:32.030 --> 00:48:32.040 align:start position:0%
people on it if you were to reverse that
 
00:48:33.950 --> 00:48:33.960 align:start position:0%
uh good luck finding enough people to
 
00:48:35.990 --> 00:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
serve on it and having that commission
 
00:48:39.050 --> 00:48:39.060 align:start position:0%
to ever even have enough to form a
 
00:48:41.630 --> 00:48:41.640 align:start position:0%
be able to have a quorum you know to
 
00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:42.829 align:start position:0%
be able to have a quorum you know to
meet

00:48:42.829 --> 00:48:42.839 align:start position:0%
meet
 
00:48:42.839 --> 00:48:45.290 align:start position:0%
meet
uh

00:48:45.290 --> 00:48:45.300 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:48:47.809 --> 00:48:47.819 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure which direction you want to
 
00:48:47.819 --> 00:48:48.670 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure which direction you want to
go

00:48:48.670 --> 00:48:48.680 align:start position:0%
go
 
00:48:51.109 --> 00:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
uh that's why you're here having all
 
00:48:52.670 --> 00:48:52.680 align:start position:0%
these discussions
 
00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:54.829 align:start position:0%
these discussions
but

00:48:54.829 --> 00:48:54.839 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:48:56.750 --> 00:48:56.760 align:start position:0%
finding people who serve on these
 
00:48:59.329 --> 00:48:59.339 align:start position:0%
committees and commissions consistently
 
00:49:02.150 --> 00:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
is getting hotter and hotter
 
00:49:04.609 --> 00:49:04.619 align:start position:0%
and especially sometimes when you have
 
00:49:06.710 --> 00:49:06.720 align:start position:0%
they have to be a certain member a
 
00:49:08.750 --> 00:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
certain amount from one Committee in a
 
00:49:10.010 --> 00:49:10.020 align:start position:0%
certain amount from another committee
 
00:49:11.329 --> 00:49:11.339 align:start position:0%
and then a certain amount from another
 
00:49:11.339 --> 00:49:13.069 align:start position:0%
and then a certain amount from another
committee

00:49:13.069 --> 00:49:13.079 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:49:14.930 --> 00:49:14.940 align:start position:0%
now you're looking at calling all three
 
00:49:17.089 --> 00:49:17.099 align:start position:0%
chairmen trying to find out who they
 
00:49:19.430 --> 00:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
might recommend to be on it the time
 
00:49:21.349 --> 00:49:21.359 align:start position:0%
that the staff is spending on this thing
 
00:49:24.290 --> 00:49:24.300 align:start position:0%
is is ridiculous and it's tying up a
 
00:49:26.569 --> 00:49:26.579 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of time so I'm hoping
 
00:49:29.030 --> 00:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
we can come to uh some solutions here
 
00:49:32.870 --> 00:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
that will both help the staff and help
 
00:49:35.349 --> 00:49:35.359 align:start position:0%
us get through these things but
 
00:49:53.630 --> 00:49:53.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:56.569 --> 00:49:56.579 align:start position:0%
um I'm trying to remember oh I know I
 
00:49:59.390 --> 00:49:59.400 align:start position:0%
was thinking about the process in ledge
 
00:50:01.190 --> 00:50:01.200 align:start position:0%
admin if we decided that there would be
 
00:50:03.170 --> 00:50:03.180 align:start position:0%
some annual maintenance or biannual
 
00:50:03.180 --> 00:50:05.089 align:start position:0%
some annual maintenance or biannual
maintenance

00:50:05.089 --> 00:50:05.099 align:start position:0%
maintenance
 
00:50:07.910 --> 00:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
um I know it depends on how it's set up
 
00:50:08.990 --> 00:50:09.000 align:start position:0%
in rules
 
00:50:11.390 --> 00:50:11.400 align:start position:0%
I'm curious one of the ways to do that
 
00:50:14.809 --> 00:50:14.819 align:start position:0%
is by introducing a bill that's just for
 
00:50:17.210 --> 00:50:17.220 align:start position:0%
that purpose it's similar to the
 
00:50:19.309 --> 00:50:19.319 align:start position:0%
you know the budget bills you know you
 
00:50:20.750 --> 00:50:20.760 align:start position:0%
just you introduce something so you have
 
00:50:23.569 --> 00:50:23.579 align:start position:0%
a vehicle that can then be used to get
 
00:50:24.650 --> 00:50:24.660 align:start position:0%
rid of
 
00:50:27.650 --> 00:50:27.660 align:start position:0%
you know sure like like an hb25 typed
 
00:50:29.210 --> 00:50:29.220 align:start position:0%
yet right I I understand what you're
 
00:50:31.730 --> 00:50:31.740 align:start position:0%
saying a placeholder type thing yep yep
 
00:50:34.609 --> 00:50:34.619 align:start position:0%
good point good suggestion
 
00:50:38.030 --> 00:50:38.040 align:start position:0%
I want to develop a little further
 
00:50:39.890 --> 00:50:39.900 align:start position:0%
well just because otherwise otherwise
 
00:50:42.589 --> 00:50:42.599 align:start position:0%
the work of the ledge admin committee or
 
00:50:44.809 --> 00:50:44.819 align:start position:0%
subcommittee would would have some ideas
 
00:50:46.849 --> 00:50:46.859 align:start position:0%
and say okay we want to dissolve these
 
00:50:48.950 --> 00:50:48.960 align:start position:0%
committees or commissions but then they
 
00:50:50.030 --> 00:50:50.040 align:start position:0%
don't have anything to it and then they
 
00:50:51.589 --> 00:50:51.599 align:start position:0%
have to they have to attach it to a bill
 
00:50:51.599 --> 00:50:53.030 align:start position:0%
have to they have to attach it to a bill
that's

00:50:53.030 --> 00:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:50:55.190 --> 00:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
totally unrelated right so it could be
 
00:50:57.170 --> 00:50:57.180 align:start position:0%
just at the beginning of every term just
 
00:51:00.349 --> 00:51:00.359 align:start position:0%
like we do with hb1 and hb2 capital
 
00:51:02.150 --> 00:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
budget you know you introduce an
 
00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
additional bill that ledge admin could
 
00:51:07.309 --> 00:51:07.319 align:start position:0%
then use for the purpose of dissolving
 
00:51:10.309 --> 00:51:10.319 align:start position:0%
committees will be a standing standing
 
00:51:11.990 --> 00:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
bill that would be reviewed every year
 
00:51:14.230 --> 00:51:14.240 align:start position:0%
or every by every uh
 
00:51:17.089 --> 00:51:17.099 align:start position:0%
yeah depending on what the rule was and
 
00:51:19.069 --> 00:51:19.079 align:start position:0%
you know yeah I think that can be part
 
00:51:20.270 --> 00:51:20.280 align:start position:0%
of further discussion I don't know that
 
00:51:22.250 --> 00:51:22.260 align:start position:0%
we need to get to that today a good idea
 
00:51:24.290 --> 00:51:24.300 align:start position:0%
because otherwise I mean what what like
 
00:51:25.670 --> 00:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
what happened to us you make the
 
00:51:27.650 --> 00:51:27.660 align:start position:0%
recommendation to repeal something and
 
00:51:29.450 --> 00:51:29.460 align:start position:0%
then you have to introduce a bill the
 
00:51:31.549 --> 00:51:31.559 align:start position:0%
next year and this way if you had sort
 
00:51:34.370 --> 00:51:34.380 align:start position:0%
of a base you could just use it right
 
00:51:34.380 --> 00:51:35.510 align:start position:0%
of a base you could just use it right
away

00:51:35.510 --> 00:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
away
 
00:51:38.230 --> 00:51:38.240 align:start position:0%
I think that's a good idea
 
00:51:42.589 --> 00:51:42.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:44.870 --> 00:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
just getting to the speaker's point and
 
00:51:46.490 --> 00:51:46.500 align:start position:0%
having gone through this the the
 
00:51:49.250 --> 00:51:49.260 align:start position:0%
assignment to commissions is just brutal
 
00:51:51.950 --> 00:51:51.960 align:start position:0%
but I and you know not to get back to
 
00:51:53.870 --> 00:51:53.880 align:start position:0%
the point again but you know we that
 
00:51:55.849 --> 00:51:55.859 align:start position:0%
that's another thing to sort of balance
 
00:51:58.309 --> 00:51:58.319 align:start position:0%
if you want if you I mean I love the
 
00:52:00.710 --> 00:52:00.720 align:start position:0%
idea of capping the number of members at
 
00:52:02.990 --> 00:52:03.000 align:start position:0%
15 but if we really want to make a
 
00:52:06.890 --> 00:52:06.900 align:start position:0%
majority of each commission legislators
 
00:52:10.549 --> 00:52:10.559 align:start position:0%
that does put more of a burden on the
 
00:52:13.130 --> 00:52:13.140 align:start position:0%
appointment process and the lens ledge
 
00:52:17.329 --> 00:52:17.339 align:start position:0%
the legislator participation so it's
 
00:52:20.569 --> 00:52:20.579 align:start position:0%
just something to to think about but
 
00:52:22.910 --> 00:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
another thing is you know in our um
 
00:52:25.870 --> 00:52:25.880 align:start position:0%
standing committee chair
 
00:52:28.130 --> 00:52:28.140 align:start position:0%
training which I really think they
 
00:52:29.870 --> 00:52:29.880 align:start position:0%
should have their own sort of training
 
00:52:32.329 --> 00:52:32.339 align:start position:0%
on how to review study committees so
 
00:52:34.549 --> 00:52:34.559 align:start position:0%
they know what to look for they can be
 
00:52:36.890 --> 00:52:36.900 align:start position:0%
asking their members okay well if you're
 
00:52:39.230 --> 00:52:39.240 align:start position:0%
enthusiastic about it creating this are
 
00:52:42.410 --> 00:52:42.420 align:start position:0%
you willing to participate in it I mean
 
00:52:45.170 --> 00:52:45.180 align:start position:0%
sort of like our idea about asking
 
00:52:47.329 --> 00:52:47.339 align:start position:0%
Senators well if you want to create this
 
00:52:50.990 --> 00:52:51.000 align:start position:0%
thing are you willing to serve on it but
 
00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:51.829 align:start position:0%
thing are you willing to serve on it but
um

00:52:51.829 --> 00:52:51.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:54.290 --> 00:52:54.300 align:start position:0%
you know and take their names the
 
00:52:57.349 --> 00:52:57.359 align:start position:0%
speaker has given me a few examples of
 
00:53:00.530 --> 00:53:00.540 align:start position:0%
where requests have been made to create
 
00:53:00.540 --> 00:53:01.849 align:start position:0%
where requests have been made to create
uh

00:53:01.849 --> 00:53:01.859 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:53:04.549 --> 00:53:04.559 align:start position:0%
commission or or committee with the
 
00:53:19.549 --> 00:53:19.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:24.890 --> 00:53:24.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:28.010 --> 00:53:28.020 align:start position:0%
just yes and just one other thought I
 
00:53:30.230 --> 00:53:30.240 align:start position:0%
mean some of the study committees
 
00:53:33.049 --> 00:53:33.059 align:start position:0%
that people are wanting to form are on
 
00:53:36.829 --> 00:53:36.839 align:start position:0%
such unbelievably narrow topics that you
 
00:53:38.809 --> 00:53:38.819 align:start position:0%
could also when you're talking to the
 
00:53:41.630 --> 00:53:41.640 align:start position:0%
chairs or whatever they could talk to
 
00:53:43.190 --> 00:53:43.200 align:start position:0%
their standing committees and say okay
 
00:53:44.990 --> 00:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
well if this is something that you would
 
00:53:47.390 --> 00:53:47.400 align:start position:0%
like to study and I know that Ian
 
00:53:49.010 --> 00:53:49.020 align:start position:0%
Fitzgerald has mentioned this many times
 
00:53:51.470 --> 00:53:51.480 align:start position:0%
there's no reason why a standing
 
00:53:53.630 --> 00:53:53.640 align:start position:0%
committee can't study it as an ad hoc
 
00:53:58.210 --> 00:53:58.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:01.370 --> 00:54:01.380 align:start position:0%
yeah or as a subcommittee right to just
 
00:54:04.609 --> 00:54:04.619 align:start position:0%
really do that work right within the in
 
00:54:05.930 --> 00:54:05.940 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:54:08.270 --> 00:54:08.280 align:start position:0%
because as I because some of them really
 
00:54:10.190 --> 00:54:10.200 align:start position:0%
are I mean if you think a lot of these
 
00:54:12.170 --> 00:54:12.180 align:start position:0%
study committees they meet maybe three
 
00:54:14.990 --> 00:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
times I mean if it's a really narrow
 
00:54:18.349 --> 00:54:18.359 align:start position:0%
subject a standing committee could do it
 
00:54:22.250 --> 00:54:22.260 align:start position:0%
yes I guess going down that path
 
00:54:25.309 --> 00:54:25.319 align:start position:0%
um would want to
 
00:54:27.730 --> 00:54:27.740 align:start position:0%
make sure that all the power didn't rest
 
00:54:32.150 --> 00:54:32.160 align:start position:0%
with the chair to establish that ad hoc
 
00:54:33.589 --> 00:54:33.599 align:start position:0%
committee or
 
00:54:36.109 --> 00:54:36.119 align:start position:0%
or the subcommittee
 
00:54:36.119 --> 00:54:37.549 align:start position:0%
or the subcommittee
um

00:54:37.549 --> 00:54:37.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:40.790 --> 00:54:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:42.890 --> 00:54:42.900 align:start position:0%
I think one when we think about how
 
00:54:44.809 --> 00:54:44.819 align:start position:0%
study committees or commissions are
 
00:54:46.190 --> 00:54:46.200 align:start position:0%
established right they go through the
 
00:54:48.109 --> 00:54:48.119 align:start position:0%
legislative process the entire chamber
 
00:54:49.430 --> 00:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
votes on it then it goes to the other
 
00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:50.990 align:start position:0%
votes on it then it goes to the other
chamber

00:54:50.990 --> 00:54:51.000 align:start position:0%
chamber
 
00:54:53.510 --> 00:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
um it gives it puts a lot of power in
 
00:54:55.190 --> 00:54:55.200 align:start position:0%
the chair and so I just want to figure
 
00:54:58.069 --> 00:54:58.079 align:start position:0%
out how we can make sure that the
 
00:54:59.930 --> 00:54:59.940 align:start position:0%
you know at least maybe the committee
 
00:55:02.510 --> 00:55:02.520 align:start position:0%
has an opportunity to say we're we're
 
00:55:03.950 --> 00:55:03.960 align:start position:0%
going to vote on this as a committee to
 
00:55:06.290 --> 00:55:06.300 align:start position:0%
establish the subcommittee or
 
00:55:06.300 --> 00:55:07.010 align:start position:0%
establish the subcommittee or
um

00:55:07.010 --> 00:55:07.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:08.870 --> 00:55:08.880 align:start position:0%
ad hoc is maybe a little bit different
 
00:55:10.370 --> 00:55:10.380 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a little bit less formal
 
00:55:10.380 --> 00:55:11.329 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a little bit less formal
but

00:55:11.329 --> 00:55:11.339 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:55:12.589 --> 00:55:12.599 align:start position:0%
um and if the subcommittee is going to
 
00:55:14.690 --> 00:55:14.700 align:start position:0%
be formed you know with some
 
00:55:15.829 --> 00:55:15.839 align:start position:0%
expectations that they're going to
 
00:55:18.230 --> 00:55:18.240 align:start position:0%
report back with some recommendations
 
00:55:22.790 --> 00:55:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:25.609 --> 00:55:25.619 align:start position:0%
yeah John uh I know for a fact that even
 
00:55:29.569 --> 00:55:29.579 align:start position:0%
as we speak uh chairman hunt has charged
 
00:55:32.630 --> 00:55:32.640 align:start position:0%
certain uh
 
00:55:35.930 --> 00:55:35.940 align:start position:0%
parts of the government to bring back
 
00:55:38.210 --> 00:55:38.220 align:start position:0%
reports so that we can work on bills
 
00:55:41.569 --> 00:55:41.579 align:start position:0%
that we have retained so he kind of
 
00:55:44.750 --> 00:55:44.760 align:start position:0%
sent that message out to them
 
00:55:47.329 --> 00:55:47.339 align:start position:0%
so that we can work on the retained
 
00:55:50.210 --> 00:55:50.220 align:start position:0%
bills without having a subcommittee or a
 
00:55:55.490 --> 00:55:55.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:57.470 --> 00:55:57.480 align:start position:0%
it's a matter of fact that we do this
 
00:56:03.410 --> 00:56:03.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:06.109 --> 00:56:06.119 align:start position:0%
so I I appreciate that and I do I do
 
00:56:06.119 --> 00:56:07.069 align:start position:0%
so I I appreciate that and I do I do
think

00:56:07.069 --> 00:56:07.079 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:56:09.049 --> 00:56:09.059 align:start position:0%
um you've heard me use the term culture
 
00:56:13.730 --> 00:56:13.740 align:start position:0%
before uh in in in respect with respect
 
00:56:16.190 --> 00:56:16.200 align:start position:0%
to uh to these types of issues and and
 
00:56:18.650 --> 00:56:18.660 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we we have sort of a
 
00:56:20.329 --> 00:56:20.339 align:start position:0%
culture of of
 
00:56:22.910 --> 00:56:22.920 align:start position:0%
um especially with one body where
 
00:56:24.950 --> 00:56:24.960 align:start position:0%
a study commission hey it's it's a it's
 
00:56:27.710 --> 00:56:27.720 align:start position:0%
a signed bill it's it's a it adds to my
 
00:56:30.470 --> 00:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
uh my uh my past my past legislation
 
00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:31.849 align:start position:0%
uh my uh my past my past legislation
streak

00:56:31.849 --> 00:56:31.859 align:start position:0%
streak
 
00:56:33.829 --> 00:56:33.839 align:start position:0%
um so you know there there is a culture
 
00:56:37.430 --> 00:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:40.430 --> 00:56:40.440 align:start position:0%
let's just study it and and and we'll
 
00:56:42.109 --> 00:56:42.119 align:start position:0%
we'll have a report and if we file
 
00:56:44.630 --> 00:56:44.640 align:start position:0%
legislation great if we don't whatever
 
00:56:47.690 --> 00:56:47.700 align:start position:0%
um I I do think that we are looking to
 
00:56:49.790 --> 00:56:49.800 align:start position:0%
change that conversation
 
00:56:52.309 --> 00:56:52.319 align:start position:0%
um in in changing cultures can be kind
 
00:56:55.370 --> 00:56:55.380 align:start position:0%
of hard so you know that's why the work
 
00:56:57.230 --> 00:56:57.240 align:start position:0%
you're all doing is is so important here
 
00:56:59.210 --> 00:56:59.220 align:start position:0%
because this is going to be a cultural
 
00:57:01.250 --> 00:57:01.260 align:start position:0%
shift if we if we if we talk about
 
00:57:02.690 --> 00:57:02.700 align:start position:0%
making some changes that are going to
 
00:57:06.109 --> 00:57:06.119 align:start position:0%
affect statute or rules or or whatever
 
00:57:08.569 --> 00:57:08.579 align:start position:0%
um that that is gonna that is gonna be a
 
00:57:11.089 --> 00:57:11.099 align:start position:0%
a big a big hurdle it's going to be a
 
00:57:12.710 --> 00:57:12.720 align:start position:0%
tough pill for some some folks as well
 
00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:13.910 align:start position:0%
tough pill for some some folks as well
especially

00:57:13.910 --> 00:57:13.920 align:start position:0%
especially
 
00:57:16.730 --> 00:57:16.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:16.740 --> 00:57:17.950 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:57:17.950 --> 00:57:17.960 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:57:20.089 --> 00:57:20.099 align:start position:0%
thank you very much you just made me
 
00:57:22.190 --> 00:57:22.200 align:start position:0%
think of something Paul what are other
 
00:57:23.990 --> 00:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
states doing
 
00:57:27.170 --> 00:57:27.180 align:start position:0%
um do you know I'm sure you do
 
00:57:29.690 --> 00:57:29.700 align:start position:0%
um can you tell us what processes they
 
00:57:31.549 --> 00:57:31.559 align:start position:0%
use that might be more efficient than
 
00:57:34.790 --> 00:57:34.800 align:start position:0%
ours uh well that's so
 
00:57:36.589 --> 00:57:36.599 align:start position:0%
first off you're not going to find a
 
00:57:38.450 --> 00:57:38.460 align:start position:0%
state as efficient as ours and and and
 
00:57:41.750 --> 00:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
but it's true because the reason is that
 
00:57:44.329 --> 00:57:44.339 align:start position:0%
every Bill gets a hearing every bill has
 
00:57:46.490 --> 00:57:46.500 align:start position:0%
to go to the floor that's what separates
 
00:57:49.069 --> 00:57:49.079 align:start position:0%
us from other states and and the fact is
 
00:57:52.250 --> 00:57:52.260 align:start position:0%
that beyond that just the fact that we
 
00:57:54.349 --> 00:57:54.359 align:start position:0%
have hearings and and a lot of bills get
 
00:57:56.690 --> 00:57:56.700 align:start position:0%
subcommittees many states can't even
 
00:57:58.670 --> 00:57:58.680 align:start position:0%
claim that so when we're talking about
 
00:58:01.069 --> 00:58:01.079 align:start position:0%
our actual Deep dive studies I mean
 
00:58:05.690 --> 00:58:05.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:12.530 --> 00:58:12.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:14.750 --> 00:58:14.760 align:start position:0%
a panel that reviews whether a
 
00:58:17.690 --> 00:58:17.700 align:start position:0%
commission or committee should um study
 
00:58:20.030 --> 00:58:20.040 align:start position:0%
but it's made up of legislators but it
 
00:58:21.230 --> 00:58:21.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't go through the legislative
 
00:58:23.809 --> 00:58:23.819 align:start position:0%
process it's just an outside commission
 
00:58:25.790 --> 00:58:25.800 align:start position:0%
that you would have to go before with
 
00:58:27.349 --> 00:58:27.359 align:start position:0%
your proposal on what you would like
 
00:58:27.359 --> 00:58:28.910 align:start position:0%
your proposal on what you would like
studied

00:58:28.910 --> 00:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
studied
 
00:58:31.250 --> 00:58:31.260 align:start position:0%
Wyoming or gen you you knew it right
 
00:58:31.260 --> 00:58:33.470 align:start position:0%
Wyoming or gen you you knew it right
Dave

00:58:33.470 --> 00:58:33.480 align:start position:0%
Dave
 
00:58:37.069 --> 00:58:37.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:43.430 --> 00:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:46.130 --> 00:58:46.140 align:start position:0%
but there but they're culture is very
 
00:58:50.030 --> 00:58:50.040 align:start position:0%
different from ours where it seems like
 
00:58:52.309 --> 00:58:52.319 align:start position:0%
the standing committees will basically
 
00:58:55.250 --> 00:58:55.260 align:start position:0%
create like a study agenda for the
 
00:58:58.309 --> 00:58:58.319 align:start position:0%
interim where they prioritize what their
 
00:59:00.170 --> 00:59:00.180 align:start position:0%
study priorities are for the year they
 
00:59:02.270 --> 00:59:02.280 align:start position:0%
go before um I think it's called the
 
00:59:04.730 --> 00:59:04.740 align:start position:0%
legislative management Council if I'm
 
00:59:07.010 --> 00:59:07.020 align:start position:0%
not mistaken
 
00:59:09.950 --> 00:59:09.960 align:start position:0%
um for approval of those priorities and
 
00:59:12.470 --> 00:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
then they go forth in the interim and
 
00:59:15.430 --> 00:59:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:18.170 --> 00:59:18.180 align:start position:0%
let me kind of review but uh my my
 
00:59:20.210 --> 00:59:20.220 align:start position:0%
understanding of what's kind of on the
 
00:59:21.770 --> 00:59:21.780 align:start position:0%
table right now is
 
00:59:25.670 --> 00:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
is that we lean on leggy admin
 
00:59:27.650 --> 00:59:27.660 align:start position:0%
to review what's
 
00:59:30.470 --> 00:59:30.480 align:start position:0%
what's happening uh on some periodic
 
00:59:30.480 --> 00:59:31.789 align:start position:0%
what's happening uh on some periodic
basis

00:59:31.789 --> 00:59:31.799 align:start position:0%
basis
 
00:59:33.650 --> 00:59:33.660 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:59:35.329 --> 00:59:35.339 align:start position:0%
and or
 
00:59:37.910 --> 00:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
a special commission like this or a
 
00:59:40.849 --> 00:59:40.859 align:start position:0%
committee like this that reviews
 
00:59:44.170 --> 00:59:44.180 align:start position:0%
uh proposals for for
 
00:59:47.569 --> 00:59:47.579 align:start position:0%
study commissions and the status of
 
00:59:50.870 --> 00:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
ongoing commissions do I see those both
 
00:59:53.270 --> 00:59:53.280 align:start position:0%
as competing no I got it wrong no I I
 
00:59:56.210 --> 00:59:56.220 align:start position:0%
don't so the way the way legislative
 
01:00:00.109 --> 01:00:00.119 align:start position:0%
Administration currently operates so
 
01:00:02.650 --> 01:00:02.660 align:start position:0%
um their definition in rule does address
 
01:00:05.390 --> 01:00:05.400 align:start position:0%
uh very specifically it says creation of
 
01:00:07.130 --> 01:00:07.140 align:start position:0%
statutory and chapter study committees
 
01:00:08.870 --> 01:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
and like entities which address the
 
01:00:11.870 --> 01:00:11.880 align:start position:0%
legislature and its procedures so that's
 
01:00:14.089 --> 01:00:14.099 align:start position:0%
that's their caveat now
 
01:00:15.890 --> 01:00:15.900 align:start position:0%
um but it's about the legislature and
 
01:00:18.109 --> 01:00:18.119 align:start position:0%
the legislative procedures so so that's
 
01:00:20.030 --> 01:00:20.040 align:start position:0%
their purview at the moment we're
 
01:00:21.230 --> 01:00:21.240 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
01:00:23.690 --> 01:00:23.700 align:start position:0%
um I well it has been talked about about
 
01:00:28.069 --> 01:00:28.079 align:start position:0%
creating a a a an additional charge
 
01:00:31.130 --> 01:00:31.140 align:start position:0%
within legislative Administration that
 
01:00:35.230 --> 01:00:35.240 align:start position:0%
on a biennial basis they will uh
 
01:00:39.170 --> 01:00:39.180 align:start position:0%
sponsor or support a list of of bills or
 
01:00:42.789 --> 01:00:42.799 align:start position:0%
review a biannual a biennial basis of of
 
01:00:44.870 --> 01:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
commissions and that sort of thing that
 
01:00:46.930 --> 01:00:46.940 align:start position:0%
can be repealed I will just mention too
 
01:00:51.109 --> 01:00:51.119 align:start position:0%
that another great caveat of RSA 1449 is
 
01:00:53.349 --> 01:00:53.359 align:start position:0%
that all new
 
01:00:57.289 --> 01:00:57.299 align:start position:0%
commissions Sunset after five years so
 
01:00:59.450 --> 01:00:59.460 align:start position:0%
that's that's a huge
 
01:01:02.270 --> 01:01:02.280 align:start position:0%
um a huge win in terms of of being able
 
01:01:04.849 --> 01:01:04.859 align:start position:0%
to call this in the future so if you
 
01:01:06.890 --> 01:01:06.900 align:start position:0%
wanted to put something in rule I would
 
01:01:09.710 --> 01:01:09.720 align:start position:0%
leave it nebulous enough that it doesn't
 
01:01:11.750 --> 01:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
say specifically you know you have to
 
01:01:13.970 --> 01:01:13.980 align:start position:0%
repeal this every single year or
 
01:01:17.870 --> 01:01:17.880 align:start position:0%
whatever because in a few years
 
01:01:20.569 --> 01:01:20.579 align:start position:0%
um if if if this group or the next group
 
01:01:22.549 --> 01:01:22.559 align:start position:0%
comes together and repeals everything
 
01:01:25.789 --> 01:01:25.799 align:start position:0%
that's old it can get be gotten rid of
 
01:01:28.069 --> 01:01:28.079 align:start position:0%
um within five years all those other
 
01:01:29.690 --> 01:01:29.700 align:start position:0%
ones are going to be gone anyway so
 
01:01:31.670 --> 01:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
they're you know the charge is going to
 
01:01:34.670 --> 01:01:34.680 align:start position:0%
exist but it won't necessarily be a an
 
01:01:38.150 --> 01:01:38.160 align:start position:0%
active one so hopefully hopefully the
 
01:01:40.010 --> 01:01:40.020 align:start position:0%
self-fulfilling prophecy is gonna it's
 
01:01:45.829 --> 01:01:45.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:47.710 --> 01:01:47.720 align:start position:0%
fill in the blank
 
01:01:50.510 --> 01:01:50.520 align:start position:0%
standard piece of legislation at the
 
01:01:53.510 --> 01:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
start of each session I'd say that we're
 
01:01:55.549 --> 01:01:55.559 align:start position:0%
going to yeah I I think that's a good
 
01:01:58.010 --> 01:01:58.020 align:start position:0%
idea I would suggest having it be in the
 
01:01:59.690 --> 01:01:59.700 align:start position:0%
second year of the session
 
01:02:01.250 --> 01:02:01.260 align:start position:0%
um similar to
 
01:02:03.589 --> 01:02:03.599 align:start position:0%
um you know House Bill 2024 which is the
 
01:02:05.569 --> 01:02:05.579 align:start position:0%
10-year plan because the in the second
 
01:02:07.910 --> 01:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
year you're more likely to to have
 
01:02:10.190 --> 01:02:10.200 align:start position:0%
results from the first year of research
 
01:02:12.650 --> 01:02:12.660 align:start position:0%
or whatever because that first year you
 
01:02:15.829 --> 01:02:15.839 align:start position:0%
know that that committee can can devote
 
01:02:17.569 --> 01:02:17.579 align:start position:0%
to doing some of that leg work and then
 
01:02:19.370 --> 01:02:19.380 align:start position:0%
in the second year you'd have that and
 
01:02:21.950 --> 01:02:21.960 align:start position:0%
we do address in rule as well
 
01:02:24.470 --> 01:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
um you know that that certain bills can
 
01:02:25.430 --> 01:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
come in
 
01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:26.470 align:start position:0%
come in
um

01:02:26.470 --> 01:02:26.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:29.030 --> 01:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
is there any objection
 
01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:30.770 align:start position:0%
is there any objection
visually

01:02:30.770 --> 01:02:30.780 align:start position:0%
visually
 
01:02:33.710 --> 01:02:33.720 align:start position:0%
have that happen as part of the con the
 
01:02:35.990 --> 01:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
consent calendar or is it at the all
 
01:02:37.430 --> 01:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
these things well no you still have to
 
01:02:39.049 --> 01:02:39.059 align:start position:0%
go through the process I mean the bill
 
01:02:40.490 --> 01:02:40.500 align:start position:0%
would still have to have its hearing and
 
01:02:43.670 --> 01:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
and all that sort of thing so it's not
 
01:02:46.309 --> 01:02:46.319 align:start position:0%
um you know that it would be subject to
 
01:02:55.970 --> 01:02:55.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:57.349 --> 01:02:57.359 align:start position:0%
permissions are considered to be
 
01:02:59.329 --> 01:02:59.339 align:start position:0%
dissolved it gives those
 
01:03:01.430 --> 01:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
the chairs of those commissions or
 
01:03:03.650 --> 01:03:03.660 align:start position:0%
members of those commissions or you know
 
01:03:05.870 --> 01:03:05.880 align:start position:0%
industry that's impacted by those
 
01:03:07.609 --> 01:03:07.619 align:start position:0%
commissions to come and make their case
 
01:03:09.770 --> 01:03:09.780 align:start position:0%
absolutely whether or not they you know
 
01:03:11.390 --> 01:03:11.400 align:start position:0%
do I know we want to keep going and
 
01:03:12.470 --> 01:03:12.480 align:start position:0%
here's we're going to give you some
 
01:03:14.089 --> 01:03:14.099 align:start position:0%
assurances that we're going to do this
 
01:03:15.349 --> 01:03:15.359 align:start position:0%
in the right way we're going to be in
 
01:03:17.390 --> 01:03:17.400 align:start position:0%
compliance with kind of the new rules of
 
01:03:19.130 --> 01:03:19.140 align:start position:0%
protocols and standard operating
 
01:03:21.230 --> 01:03:21.240 align:start position:0%
procedures of commissions moving forward
 
01:03:23.270 --> 01:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
and that's why you still need the public
 
01:03:25.730 --> 01:03:25.740 align:start position:0%
hearing process for for exactly for that
 
01:03:28.010 --> 01:03:28.020 align:start position:0%
purpose and I think that's I would
 
01:03:30.049 --> 01:03:30.059 align:start position:0%
rather and I think we're headed in this
 
01:03:31.490 --> 01:03:31.500 align:start position:0%
direction would rather
 
01:03:35.089 --> 01:03:35.099 align:start position:0%
as a committee spend time thinking about
 
01:03:36.230 --> 01:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
the future
 
01:03:38.569 --> 01:03:38.579 align:start position:0%
rather than this committee taking time
 
01:03:40.549 --> 01:03:40.559 align:start position:0%
to look at all you know go through all
 
01:03:41.630 --> 01:03:41.640 align:start position:0%
the different
 
01:03:43.130 --> 01:03:43.140 align:start position:0%
committees and commissions that exist
 
01:03:45.289 --> 01:03:45.299 align:start position:0%
and say oh we should cut these let's
 
01:03:46.789 --> 01:03:46.799 align:start position:0%
leave that to
 
01:03:50.349 --> 01:03:50.359 align:start position:0%
us so what that public sorry process
 
01:03:52.849 --> 01:03:52.859 align:start position:0%
would that public hearing process happen
 
01:03:55.549 --> 01:03:55.559 align:start position:0%
here it happened let's see admin it
 
01:03:56.930 --> 01:03:56.940 align:start position:0%
would it would be legislative
 
01:03:58.789 --> 01:03:58.799 align:start position:0%
Administration if that's if that's what
 
01:04:00.049 --> 01:04:00.059 align:start position:0%
you want to do if that's the way you
 
01:04:01.609 --> 01:04:01.619 align:start position:0%
want to craft it then yeah it would be
 
01:04:03.289 --> 01:04:03.299 align:start position:0%
the policy committee that would have the
 
01:04:07.370 --> 01:04:07.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:10.490 --> 01:04:10.500 align:start position:0%
Okay so originally I was understanding
 
01:04:13.910 --> 01:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
that we would work with house committee
 
01:04:16.730 --> 01:04:16.740 align:start position:0%
Services because they kind of look over
 
01:04:19.549 --> 01:04:19.559 align:start position:0%
this like they did for us today to tell
 
01:04:21.049 --> 01:04:21.059 align:start position:0%
us the five that they feel that can be
 
01:04:21.059 --> 01:04:22.210 align:start position:0%
us the five that they feel that can be
repealed

01:04:22.210 --> 01:04:22.220 align:start position:0%
repealed
 
01:04:24.829 --> 01:04:24.839 align:start position:0%
would you continue to do that and then
 
01:04:26.990 --> 01:04:27.000 align:start position:0%
you would bring that to ledge admin or
 
01:04:28.849 --> 01:04:28.859 align:start position:0%
would it be our charge to go through
 
01:04:31.309 --> 01:04:31.319 align:start position:0%
every commission and committee every
 
01:04:33.170 --> 01:04:33.180 align:start position:0%
biennium well I think we would continue
 
01:04:35.569 --> 01:04:35.579 align:start position:0%
to do that because as you're we are your
 
01:04:37.609 --> 01:04:37.619 align:start position:0%
committee staff and you charge us with
 
01:04:40.190 --> 01:04:40.200 align:start position:0%
doing work for you so I believe we'd
 
01:04:41.750 --> 01:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
still be involved but as you know that's
 
01:04:44.390 --> 01:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
probably a piece of working with I.T and
 
01:04:46.309 --> 01:04:46.319 align:start position:0%
with Deborah to develop a good system
 
01:04:48.410 --> 01:04:48.420 align:start position:0%
that will have that's electronic that
 
01:04:49.970 --> 01:04:49.980 align:start position:0%
will help support all this but
 
01:04:51.530 --> 01:04:51.540 align:start position:0%
absolutely we'd still be working with
 
01:04:51.540 --> 01:04:54.230 align:start position:0%
absolutely we'd still be working with
you

01:04:54.230 --> 01:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:55.549 --> 01:04:55.559 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:04:56.930 --> 01:04:56.940 align:start position:0%
um good question
 
01:04:59.150 --> 01:04:59.160 align:start position:0%
um okay so we're talking process and the
 
01:05:00.770 --> 01:05:00.780 align:start position:0%
demonstration taking care of this and
 
01:05:01.970 --> 01:05:01.980 align:start position:0%
all I don't have a problem that
 
01:05:04.190 --> 01:05:04.200 align:start position:0%
whatsoever it's a good idea
 
01:05:06.170 --> 01:05:06.180 align:start position:0%
um what about the subject matter beyond
 
01:05:07.549 --> 01:05:07.559 align:start position:0%
the process
 
01:05:07.559 --> 01:05:08.930 align:start position:0%
the process
uh

01:05:08.930 --> 01:05:08.940 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:05:11.809 --> 01:05:11.819 align:start position:0%
you have to one I would think whoever
 
01:05:13.609 --> 01:05:13.619 align:start position:0%
handles these has to have an
 
01:05:16.069 --> 01:05:16.079 align:start position:0%
understanding of what the subject is
 
01:05:18.770 --> 01:05:18.780 align:start position:0%
that we would be establishing the
 
01:05:22.549 --> 01:05:22.559 align:start position:0%
committee for that was not no no I uh
 
01:05:24.049 --> 01:05:24.059 align:start position:0%
representative I I think the the
 
01:05:27.109 --> 01:05:27.119 align:start position:0%
question is the bill that comes in the
 
01:05:28.490 --> 01:05:28.500 align:start position:0%
second year
 
01:05:30.710 --> 01:05:30.720 align:start position:0%
um you know in terms of because because
 
01:05:33.349 --> 01:05:33.359 align:start position:0%
HCS is going to work with leg ad because
 
01:05:35.329 --> 01:05:35.339 align:start position:0%
that that that's never going to change
 
01:05:36.950 --> 01:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
they're we're not expecting you
 
01:05:39.109 --> 01:05:39.119 align:start position:0%
representative Sheen to open up your you
 
01:05:41.089 --> 01:05:41.099 align:start position:0%
know your notebook uh and with with
 
01:05:42.829 --> 01:05:42.839 align:start position:0%
magnifying glasses that's that's not
 
01:05:45.170 --> 01:05:45.180 align:start position:0%
nobody's suggesting that
 
01:05:47.089 --> 01:05:47.099 align:start position:0%
um but I think with respect to a bill
 
01:05:50.450 --> 01:05:50.460 align:start position:0%
that would come that would be crafted
 
01:05:53.630 --> 01:05:53.640 align:start position:0%
um you know that notice of of when hey
 
01:05:56.690 --> 01:05:56.700 align:start position:0%
these 10 commissions are on the chopping
 
01:05:59.809 --> 01:05:59.819 align:start position:0%
block you know the chair either the
 
01:06:01.670 --> 01:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
chair or HCS or the speaker's office
 
01:06:03.950 --> 01:06:03.960 align:start position:0%
would reach out to those various chairs
 
01:06:06.650 --> 01:06:06.660 align:start position:0%
of committees and say Hey FYI this bill
 
01:06:09.349 --> 01:06:09.359 align:start position:0%
is on on the agenda next week or or
 
01:06:09.359 --> 01:06:10.190 align:start position:0%
is on on the agenda next week or or
whatever

01:06:10.190 --> 01:06:10.200 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
01:06:16.609 --> 01:06:16.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:19.130 --> 01:06:19.140 align:start position:0%
crafting that legislation well it would
 
01:06:21.289 --> 01:06:21.299 align:start position:0%
be the same as in crafting any other so
 
01:06:23.450 --> 01:06:23.460 align:start position:0%
where the the work is going to be done
 
01:06:23.460 --> 01:06:25.309 align:start position:0%
where the the work is going to be done
by

01:06:25.309 --> 01:06:25.319 align:start position:0%
by
 
01:06:30.109 --> 01:06:30.119 align:start position:0%
the committee with y'all and and and the
 
01:06:32.390 --> 01:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
committee itself can actually vote to
 
01:06:34.670 --> 01:06:34.680 align:start position:0%
introduce legislation uh and bring
 
01:06:36.950 --> 01:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
legislation forward so that's that's
 
01:06:38.870 --> 01:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
something within the committee's purview
 
01:06:42.650 --> 01:06:42.660 align:start position:0%
now they can vote you know in in the
 
01:06:45.589 --> 01:06:45.599 align:start position:0%
fall uh to to introduce this legislation
 
01:06:48.470 --> 01:06:48.480 align:start position:0%
uh it'll go through the drafting process
 
01:06:50.750 --> 01:06:50.760 align:start position:0%
as any other bill would and get assigned
 
01:06:52.730 --> 01:06:52.740 align:start position:0%
and that sort of Justice
 
01:06:52.740 --> 01:06:53.930 align:start position:0%
and that sort of Justice
yes

01:06:53.930 --> 01:06:53.940 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:06:57.470 --> 01:06:57.480 align:start position:0%
and if this is implemented within rules
 
01:06:59.930 --> 01:06:59.940 align:start position:0%
bottom line this is going to eventually
 
01:07:02.690 --> 01:07:02.700 align:start position:0%
help the speaker's office if we look at
 
01:07:05.150 --> 01:07:05.160 align:start position:0%
this every biennium and cut off the dead
 
01:07:08.270 --> 01:07:08.280 align:start position:0%
weight so to speak this is ultimately
 
01:07:09.770 --> 01:07:09.780 align:start position:0%
going to help the speaker's office with
 
01:07:12.289 --> 01:07:12.299 align:start position:0%
all the appointments I I do think so I I
 
01:07:15.049 --> 01:07:15.059 align:start position:0%
do think that you know whether or not
 
01:07:18.650 --> 01:07:18.660 align:start position:0%
you like the the language that was uh in
 
01:07:21.049 --> 01:07:21.059 align:start position:0%
this proposal uh from Gemini
 
01:07:23.029 --> 01:07:23.039 align:start position:0%
um you know whether you you want to go
 
01:07:24.770 --> 01:07:24.780 align:start position:0%
forward with something like that I think
 
01:07:27.829 --> 01:07:27.839 align:start position:0%
that definitely is going to be a
 
01:07:29.630 --> 01:07:29.640 align:start position:0%
a catch
 
01:07:32.150 --> 01:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
um that that is going to help I also
 
01:07:34.490 --> 01:07:34.500 align:start position:0%
think that you know if if you want to
 
01:07:37.910 --> 01:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
craft more more narrowly
 
01:07:40.670 --> 01:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
um how whether it's in statute even if
 
01:07:43.609 --> 01:07:43.619 align:start position:0%
you want to amend 1449 further in terms
 
01:07:46.789 --> 01:07:46.799 align:start position:0%
of of of winnowing it down a bit
 
01:07:49.309 --> 01:07:49.319 align:start position:0%
um and trying to uh to catch some of
 
01:07:52.370 --> 01:07:52.380 align:start position:0%
these Rogue or runaway commissions then
 
01:07:55.309 --> 01:07:55.319 align:start position:0%
then that's a potential as well but
 
01:07:57.109 --> 01:07:57.119 align:start position:0%
that's why you're all getting the big
 
01:07:57.119 --> 01:08:00.529 align:start position:0%
that's why you're all getting the big
butts

01:08:00.529 --> 01:08:00.539 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:02.390 --> 01:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
um confirm again that house community
 
01:08:04.910 --> 01:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
services will be working if LED Jazz
 
01:08:07.549 --> 01:08:07.559 align:start position:0%
committee or any standing committee we
 
01:08:08.630 --> 01:08:08.640 align:start position:0%
will work with you and that's why we're
 
01:08:10.130 --> 01:08:10.140 align:start position:0%
trying to develop these systems to help
 
01:08:11.569 --> 01:08:11.579 align:start position:0%
you look at whether it's subject matter
 
01:08:14.390 --> 01:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
or the size of whatever it may be but
 
01:08:16.550 --> 01:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
for instance another anecdotal situation
 
01:08:18.530 --> 01:08:18.540 align:start position:0%
we had a researcher who worked with her
 
01:08:21.349 --> 01:08:21.359 align:start position:0%
pointed out to the chair that this
 
01:08:23.450 --> 01:08:23.460 align:start position:0%
commission was already in existence made
 
01:08:24.709 --> 01:08:24.719 align:start position:0%
sure the community knew it but they
 
01:08:26.090 --> 01:08:26.100 align:start position:0%
passed it anyway
 
01:08:29.749 --> 01:08:29.759 align:start position:0%
so we will so that's why possibly some
 
01:08:32.510 --> 01:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
other we're looking or or hoping you
 
01:08:35.269 --> 01:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
will come up with other suggestions as
 
01:08:38.209 --> 01:08:38.219 align:start position:0%
to how we can can guide we want to do
 
01:08:40.249 --> 01:08:40.259 align:start position:0%
can we get for the chairs
 
01:08:42.229 --> 01:08:42.239 align:start position:0%
um above the standing committees all the
 
01:08:44.150 --> 01:08:44.160 align:start position:0%
policy communities but also see if
 
01:08:46.930 --> 01:08:46.940 align:start position:0%
legislative Administration is another
 
01:08:50.450 --> 01:08:50.460 align:start position:0%
tool just to find out why would you have
 
01:08:52.550 --> 01:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
two commissions on a similar subject
 
01:08:55.130 --> 01:08:55.140 align:start position:0%
which is one of the things that we're
 
01:08:56.749 --> 01:08:56.759 align:start position:0%
trying to get at but we will make sure
 
01:08:59.329 --> 01:08:59.339 align:start position:0%
that there are systems in place that all
 
01:09:01.669 --> 01:09:01.679 align:start position:0%
the membership will know about and and
 
01:09:03.050 --> 01:09:03.060 align:start position:0%
particularly the chairs through
 
01:09:06.169 --> 01:09:06.179 align:start position:0%
continuing ed well do we need to modify
 
01:09:06.179 --> 01:09:08.630 align:start position:0%
continuing ed well do we need to modify
1449

01:09:08.630 --> 01:09:08.640 align:start position:0%
1449
 
01:09:11.870 --> 01:09:11.880 align:start position:0%
again I I that's up to you I I only
 
01:09:13.910 --> 01:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned it if you wanted to sort of
 
01:09:15.769 --> 01:09:15.779 align:start position:0%
make it more stringent again I do think
 
01:09:18.349 --> 01:09:18.359 align:start position:0%
the section that's in SB 84 that's been
 
01:09:20.809 --> 01:09:20.819 align:start position:0%
retained in like admin uh that deals
 
01:09:23.450 --> 01:09:23.460 align:start position:0%
with the outside agencies hosting I do
 
01:09:25.849 --> 01:09:25.859 align:start position:0%
think that that is a strong
 
01:09:28.189 --> 01:09:28.199 align:start position:0%
um uh just based on our our experience
 
01:09:30.769 --> 01:09:30.779 align:start position:0%
over the last two years of having these
 
01:09:34.130 --> 01:09:34.140 align:start position:0%
outside groups uh state agencies hosting
 
01:09:36.709 --> 01:09:36.719 align:start position:0%
I do think that that has has been
 
01:09:36.719 --> 01:09:38.269 align:start position:0%
I do think that that has has been
beneficial

01:09:38.269 --> 01:09:38.279 align:start position:0%
beneficial
 
01:09:43.490 --> 01:09:43.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:46.669 --> 01:09:46.679 align:start position:0%
Matt you had something I guess I just
 
01:09:49.550 --> 01:09:49.560 align:start position:0%
wanted to refocus this on the culture
 
01:09:51.229 --> 01:09:51.239 align:start position:0%
change piece and I think that some of
 
01:09:52.070 --> 01:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
the work
 
01:09:53.630 --> 01:09:53.640 align:start position:0%
you know that's been put together for
 
01:09:55.310 --> 01:09:55.320 align:start position:0%
today's session just around trainings
 
01:09:57.530 --> 01:09:57.540 align:start position:0%
and what kind of you know briefings need
 
01:10:00.050 --> 01:10:00.060 align:start position:0%
to be made to chairs to the caucuses
 
01:10:02.150 --> 01:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
Etc it's really important I mean it's
 
01:10:04.490 --> 01:10:04.500 align:start position:0%
like this you don't just snap your
 
01:10:06.290 --> 01:10:06.300 align:start position:0%
fingers and say okay we're gonna make
 
01:10:07.790 --> 01:10:07.800 align:start position:0%
these changes and everyone's gonna
 
01:10:09.169 --> 01:10:09.179 align:start position:0%
follow along and if things are going to
 
01:10:11.689 --> 01:10:11.699 align:start position:0%
be different like this is about making
 
01:10:13.430 --> 01:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
sure people really understand make sure
 
01:10:15.050 --> 01:10:15.060 align:start position:0%
our colleagues really understand
 
01:10:18.229 --> 01:10:18.239 align:start position:0%
why this is important why we're you know
 
01:10:20.750 --> 01:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
proposing new rules changes why we're
 
01:10:23.870 --> 01:10:23.880 align:start position:0%
proposing uh you know perhaps changes in
 
01:10:25.850 --> 01:10:25.860 align:start position:0%
statute or why we're and or why we're
 
01:10:27.530 --> 01:10:27.540 align:start position:0%
just saying hey there's this worksheet
 
01:10:29.030 --> 01:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
that isn't going to require legislation
 
01:10:31.430 --> 01:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
that you know OLS is going to be able to
 
01:10:34.130 --> 01:10:34.140 align:start position:0%
you know work with members through
 
01:10:36.350 --> 01:10:36.360 align:start position:0%
um to all of it all of it contributes
 
01:10:38.510 --> 01:10:38.520 align:start position:0%
towards a culture change in the the
 
01:10:40.550 --> 01:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
desired outcome which I think we all
 
01:10:42.709 --> 01:10:42.719 align:start position:0%
share which is you know a smaller number
 
01:10:45.110 --> 01:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
of these committees and commissions and
 
01:10:47.750 --> 01:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
or at least you know a way to phase them
 
01:10:49.790 --> 01:10:49.800 align:start position:0%
out if they're not being productive well
 
01:10:52.370 --> 01:10:52.380 align:start position:0%
I I think truthfully even if you all
 
01:10:54.530 --> 01:10:54.540 align:start position:0%
decide not to to do anything with rules
 
01:10:56.750 --> 01:10:56.760 align:start position:0%
changes or the statute at the end of the
 
01:10:59.209 --> 01:10:59.219 align:start position:0%
day I think that's fine the fact is that
 
01:11:01.130 --> 01:11:01.140 align:start position:0%
we've changed the way we're going to
 
01:11:04.130 --> 01:11:04.140 align:start position:0%
draft a legislation uh with the analysis
 
01:11:05.870 --> 01:11:05.880 align:start position:0%
and the fact that we're going to make
 
01:11:07.790 --> 01:11:07.800 align:start position:0%
those more searchable right on our
 
01:11:09.649 --> 01:11:09.659 align:start position:0%
Advanced Bill search I think that is
 
01:11:13.189 --> 01:11:13.199 align:start position:0%
going to be exponentially beneficial to
 
01:11:14.090 --> 01:11:14.100 align:start position:0%
you all
 
01:11:16.370 --> 01:11:16.380 align:start position:0%
um not just to you all but to all
 
01:11:18.470 --> 01:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
members and to the outside world
 
01:11:21.350 --> 01:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
so so does it does it make sense are we
 
01:11:24.050 --> 01:11:24.060 align:start position:0%
in some agreement here that when Anne
 
01:11:26.750 --> 01:11:26.760 align:start position:0%
develops that video training
 
01:11:29.390 --> 01:11:29.400 align:start position:0%
that we take that to our
 
01:11:32.510 --> 01:11:32.520 align:start position:0%
to our caucuses and share that training
 
01:11:34.189 --> 01:11:34.199 align:start position:0%
and advocate
 
01:11:37.370 --> 01:11:37.380 align:start position:0%
for these uh this cultural change
 
01:11:40.370 --> 01:11:40.380 align:start position:0%
well Mr chair could we possibly maybe in
 
01:11:42.050 --> 01:11:42.060 align:start position:0%
a future meeting we could bring forward
 
01:11:44.990 --> 01:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
what we've done in the past so that
 
01:11:47.209 --> 01:11:47.219 align:start position:0%
many people who are
 
01:11:48.709 --> 01:11:48.719 align:start position:0%
some people who are new would find out
 
01:11:50.570 --> 01:11:50.580 align:start position:0%
what we've done before as far as can
 
01:11:52.669 --> 01:11:52.679 align:start position:0%
chewing it and show you
 
01:11:55.370 --> 01:11:55.380 align:start position:0%
um it can be added to your binder but
 
01:11:57.229 --> 01:11:57.239 align:start position:0%
show you the examples of what we've
 
01:11:59.450 --> 01:11:59.460 align:start position:0%
covered and how we've done that all and
 
01:12:02.450 --> 01:12:02.460 align:start position:0%
then proceed with the videos but just to
 
01:12:04.189 --> 01:12:04.199 align:start position:0%
show you the work that's been done so
 
01:12:06.830 --> 01:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
you can look at that and um
 
01:12:09.430 --> 01:12:09.440 align:start position:0%
see if that's how you want to proceed
 
01:12:13.970 --> 01:12:13.980 align:start position:0%
very powerful if the caucus leaders
 
01:12:17.870 --> 01:12:17.880 align:start position:0%
bring forth a very similar message to
 
01:12:19.450 --> 01:12:19.460 align:start position:0%
their membership
 
01:12:22.250 --> 01:12:22.260 align:start position:0%
this is a new way of doing business it's
 
01:12:24.290 --> 01:12:24.300 align:start position:0%
a cultural change we need to embrace
 
01:12:26.630 --> 01:12:26.640 align:start position:0%
this going forward and we need to all
 
01:12:28.250 --> 01:12:28.260 align:start position:0%
work together I think I think that would
 
01:12:30.470 --> 01:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
be a very powerful message
 
01:12:33.590 --> 01:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
but we wouldn't we're going to need to
 
01:12:36.410 --> 01:12:36.420 align:start position:0%
come to grips with us and have a
 
01:12:39.530 --> 01:12:39.540 align:start position:0%
hand-holding session before before we
 
01:12:43.250 --> 01:12:43.260 align:start position:0%
before we before we leave uh that time
 
01:12:45.590 --> 01:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
if I may Mr chairman I do want to just
 
01:12:48.110 --> 01:12:48.120 align:start position:0%
say you know working within over the
 
01:12:50.270 --> 01:12:50.280 align:start position:0%
years on on these things I mean our
 
01:12:52.490 --> 01:12:52.500 align:start position:0%
Focus has always been from a nonpartisan
 
01:12:54.350 --> 01:12:54.360 align:start position:0%
standpoint and and when we have
 
01:12:56.689 --> 01:12:56.699 align:start position:0%
continuing education sessions they are
 
01:12:59.090 --> 01:12:59.100 align:start position:0%
always non-political so if you're
 
01:13:01.189 --> 01:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan all staff is nonpartisan
 
01:13:03.229 --> 01:13:03.239 align:start position:0%
except for your the
 
01:13:03.239 --> 01:13:04.790 align:start position:0%
except for your the
um to

01:13:04.790 --> 01:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
um to
 
01:13:07.790 --> 01:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
the dissemination process right but so
 
01:13:09.229 --> 01:13:09.239 align:start position:0%
we would not be part of that I mean we
 
01:13:11.090 --> 01:13:11.100 align:start position:0%
usually aren't so all of the canoeing Ed
 
01:13:12.709 --> 01:13:12.719 align:start position:0%
has always been for all the membership
 
01:13:15.950 --> 01:13:15.960 align:start position:0%
and as and obviously chairs
 
01:13:17.450 --> 01:13:17.460 align:start position:0%
um but I know that I actually have given
 
01:13:19.250 --> 01:13:19.260 align:start position:0%
Dan Mason some messages say could you
 
01:13:21.169 --> 01:13:21.179 align:start position:0%
ask some ranking members during your
 
01:13:24.110 --> 01:13:24.120 align:start position:0%
meetings to just remind them of meeting
 
01:13:25.669 --> 01:13:25.679 align:start position:0%
the deadlines for the calendar for
 
01:13:27.890 --> 01:13:27.900 align:start position:0%
instance for committee reports things of
 
01:13:29.870 --> 01:13:29.880 align:start position:0%
that nature but for the most part as
 
01:13:32.570 --> 01:13:32.580 align:start position:0%
Paul said we never step foot into a
 
01:13:32.580 --> 01:13:33.729 align:start position:0%
Paul said we never step foot into a
conference

01:13:33.729 --> 01:13:33.739 align:start position:0%
conference
 
01:13:35.810 --> 01:13:35.820 align:start position:0%
let me throw this out is there a better
 
01:13:39.649 --> 01:13:39.659 align:start position:0%
dissemination process other other than
 
01:13:42.890 --> 01:13:42.900 align:start position:0%
a caucus session the continuing the
 
01:13:44.330 --> 01:13:44.340 align:start position:0%
continuing education that's why I had
 
01:13:45.649 --> 01:13:45.659 align:start position:0%
asked if we could come back and I can
 
01:13:47.750 --> 01:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
show you exactly what we did for those
 
01:13:50.209 --> 01:13:50.219 align:start position:0%
full day programs or have to use the
 
01:13:53.390 --> 01:13:53.400 align:start position:0%
speaker because we used to have a
 
01:13:55.250 --> 01:13:55.260 align:start position:0%
continuing education program that went
 
01:13:56.750 --> 01:13:56.760 align:start position:0%
throughout the year we had all different
 
01:13:58.790 --> 01:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
subjects and that stopped obviously with
 
01:14:01.250 --> 01:14:01.260 align:start position:0%
covid as everything else has and
 
01:14:02.390 --> 01:14:02.400 align:start position:0%
obviously now that we're getting back
 
01:14:04.490 --> 01:14:04.500 align:start position:0%
into the swing of things that may be
 
01:14:05.689 --> 01:14:05.699 align:start position:0%
something we we haven't had the
 
01:14:06.950 --> 01:14:06.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity to meet with the speaker yet
 
01:14:10.370 --> 01:14:10.380 align:start position:0%
but that also it's it's a bipartisan
 
01:14:12.830 --> 01:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
effort in education the panelists are
 
01:14:15.530 --> 01:14:15.540 align:start position:0%
both represent both caucuses but we just
 
01:14:17.270 --> 01:14:17.280 align:start position:0%
a good majority of your staff don't
 
01:14:18.950 --> 01:14:18.960 align:start position:0%
think in term of caucus I think in terms
 
01:14:20.470 --> 01:14:20.480 align:start position:0%
of the entire house
 
01:14:23.689 --> 01:14:23.699 align:start position:0%
of it would it be a session in the in
 
01:14:25.450 --> 01:14:25.460 align:start position:0%
the hall
 
01:14:28.070 --> 01:14:28.080 align:start position:0%
that's where we've had them or 210 to 11
 
01:14:30.590 --> 01:14:30.600 align:start position:0%
we're in the hall usually 2 10 to 11 is
 
01:14:33.530 --> 01:14:33.540 align:start position:0%
a better venue and we have panels and it
 
01:14:35.810 --> 01:14:35.820 align:start position:0%
goes all day we start at 9 00 A.M
 
01:14:37.790 --> 01:14:37.800 align:start position:0%
tea coffee
 
01:14:40.070 --> 01:14:40.080 align:start position:0%
um continental breakfast and then we go
 
01:14:42.950 --> 01:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
in and we have subject matters and we
 
01:14:44.450 --> 01:14:44.460 align:start position:0%
and that's why I want you to see these
 
01:14:46.970 --> 01:14:46.980 align:start position:0%
and we've had them every two or two to
 
01:14:49.910 --> 01:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
three years for well it goes all the way
 
01:14:52.850 --> 01:14:52.860 align:start position:0%
back to the um late 80s so we've had
 
01:14:54.950 --> 01:14:54.960 align:start position:0%
these info sessions
 
01:14:58.610 --> 01:14:58.620 align:start position:0%
so in with the caucus role be to promote
 
01:15:01.729 --> 01:15:01.739 align:start position:0%
the Uptown upcoming continuing ed or
 
01:15:03.890 --> 01:15:03.900 align:start position:0%
maybe to I think so but we urge people
 
01:15:06.590 --> 01:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:08.750 --> 01:15:08.760 align:start position:0%
I think that would that would help but I
 
01:15:11.030 --> 01:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
also think that we we put a box that's
 
01:15:13.370 --> 01:15:13.380 align:start position:0%
how the Box the Box in your house
 
01:15:15.410 --> 01:15:15.420 align:start position:0%
calendar it started from continuing ed
 
01:15:17.630 --> 01:15:17.640 align:start position:0%
now the box where we highlight any
 
01:15:19.550 --> 01:15:19.560 align:start position:0%
information we want you to have that
 
01:15:21.110 --> 01:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
would go there and then also speakers
 
01:15:23.270 --> 01:15:23.280 align:start position:0%
message has it and it's nest on the
 
01:15:25.910 --> 01:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
floor and then of course the support the
 
01:15:27.229 --> 01:15:27.239 align:start position:0%
support when you're in the caucuses
 
01:15:29.270 --> 01:15:29.280 align:start position:0%
would be another Avenue to get the
 
01:15:30.830 --> 01:15:30.840 align:start position:0%
information out but it's also trying to
 
01:15:33.890 --> 01:15:33.900 align:start position:0%
get make sure people attend that that's
 
01:15:35.270 --> 01:15:35.280 align:start position:0%
very helpful because you can work as
 
01:15:37.930 --> 01:15:37.940 align:start position:0%
hard as we can but
 
01:15:40.370 --> 01:15:40.380 align:start position:0%
people who should attend don't always
 
01:15:42.350 --> 01:15:42.360 align:start position:0%
attend and it's but it's good info
 
01:15:44.390 --> 01:15:44.400 align:start position:0%
session but then hopefully the videos
 
01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:45.590 align:start position:0%
session but then hopefully the videos
would

01:15:45.590 --> 01:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:15:47.209 --> 01:15:47.219 align:start position:0%
um they would be able to sit and listen
 
01:15:50.030 --> 01:15:50.040 align:start position:0%
to the video yeah well I was just
 
01:15:52.910 --> 01:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
wondering as far as timing when we could
 
01:15:55.669 --> 01:15:55.679 align:start position:0%
have a continuing education
 
01:15:58.669 --> 01:15:58.679 align:start position:0%
on this not sure I mean I don't know if
 
01:16:01.850 --> 01:16:01.860 align:start position:0%
we can get it in before I get an ID on
 
01:16:04.010 --> 01:16:04.020 align:start position:0%
that I was going to feel filing coming
 
01:16:04.020 --> 01:16:05.450 align:start position:0%
that I was going to feel filing coming
and

01:16:05.450 --> 01:16:05.460 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:16:06.830 --> 01:16:06.840 align:start position:0%
I was going to ask the speaker about
 
01:16:08.750 --> 01:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
that when we could have a an area we
 
01:16:10.250 --> 01:16:10.260 align:start position:0%
could have a day
 
01:16:12.709 --> 01:16:12.719 align:start position:0%
um to do that because
 
01:16:14.330 --> 01:16:14.340 align:start position:0%
you're right with the bill filing and to
 
01:16:16.370 --> 01:16:16.380 align:start position:0%
get people because we they are well
 
01:16:18.229 --> 01:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
attended um when we had these in the
 
01:16:20.450 --> 01:16:20.460 align:start position:0%
past remember we were up actually we
 
01:16:23.090 --> 01:16:23.100 align:start position:0%
were 306 308 because I remember we had
 
01:16:23.100 --> 01:16:23.930 align:start position:0%
were 306 308 because I remember we had
about

01:16:23.930 --> 01:16:23.940 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:16:26.630 --> 01:16:26.640 align:start position:0%
um at least 120 and sometimes as many as
 
01:16:28.430 --> 01:16:28.440 align:start position:0%
150 members show
 
01:16:30.290 --> 01:16:30.300 align:start position:0%
for these continent programs that's what
 
01:16:31.910 --> 01:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
was my concern yes they showed that's
 
01:16:33.470 --> 01:16:33.480 align:start position:0%
why I was thinking caucus mean because
 
01:16:34.910 --> 01:16:34.920 align:start position:0%
people typically attend the caucus
 
01:16:36.950 --> 01:16:36.960 align:start position:0%
Museum they do show up looking for a way
 
01:16:38.689 --> 01:16:38.699 align:start position:0%
to get higher attendance the last time
 
01:16:45.410 --> 01:16:45.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:47.810 --> 01:16:47.820 align:start position:0%
and we have people out in the hall with
 
01:16:50.209 --> 01:16:50.219 align:start position:0%
all the doors open listening so as you
 
01:16:51.709 --> 01:16:51.719 align:start position:0%
know Repsol can often be if you don't
 
01:16:54.470 --> 01:16:54.480 align:start position:0%
have 400 people in there the Acoustics
 
01:16:56.270 --> 01:16:56.280 align:start position:0%
can sometimes be difficult so that's why
 
01:16:58.970 --> 01:16:58.980 align:start position:0%
we like to do it in committee room but
 
01:17:00.950 --> 01:17:00.960 align:start position:0%
um we did we had a huge
 
01:17:03.430 --> 01:17:03.440 align:start position:0%
um crowd who must have had at least
 
01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:05.290 align:start position:0%
um crowd who must have had at least
15

01:17:05.290 --> 01:17:05.300 align:start position:0%
15
 
01:17:08.090 --> 01:17:08.100 align:start position:0%
chairs and other members present
 
01:17:09.890 --> 01:17:09.900 align:start position:0%
throughout the day as well as staff do
 
01:17:12.169 --> 01:17:12.179 align:start position:0%
we open those those training sessions to
 
01:17:13.729 --> 01:17:13.739 align:start position:0%
the public or to the press or anything
 
01:17:13.739 --> 01:17:15.590 align:start position:0%
the public or to the press or anything
no

01:17:15.590 --> 01:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:17:17.750 --> 01:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
um well not typically because it's
 
01:17:19.430 --> 01:17:19.440 align:start position:0%
continuing education for the members so
 
01:17:21.470 --> 01:17:21.480 align:start position:0%
you want the members participating and
 
01:17:26.330 --> 01:17:26.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:29.330 --> 01:17:29.340 align:start position:0%
oh thank you Mr chairman just sitting
 
01:17:30.649 --> 01:17:30.659 align:start position:0%
here thinking about a lot of the good
 
01:17:33.410 --> 01:17:33.420 align:start position:0%
classes come up already I was wondering
 
01:17:35.330 --> 01:17:35.340 align:start position:0%
as part of the betting process for
 
01:17:38.030 --> 01:17:38.040 align:start position:0%
commission bills if they wouldn't go
 
01:17:40.130 --> 01:17:40.140 align:start position:0%
before the Rules Committee just the same
 
01:17:43.370 --> 01:17:43.380 align:start position:0%
methodology there's a late filing they
 
01:17:45.950 --> 01:17:45.960 align:start position:0%
need to build that the rules committee
 
01:17:48.530 --> 01:17:48.540 align:start position:0%
threat those questions in about the
 
01:17:50.930 --> 01:17:50.940 align:start position:0%
performance to see that the members
 
01:17:53.510 --> 01:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
already done their homework on this bill
 
01:17:55.729 --> 01:17:55.739 align:start position:0%
it's just tougher to think about thank
 
01:17:55.739 --> 01:17:57.229 align:start position:0%
it's just tougher to think about thank
you

01:17:57.229 --> 01:17:57.239 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:18:02.570 --> 01:18:02.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:05.030 --> 01:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
any other comments
 
01:18:07.490 --> 01:18:07.500 align:start position:0%
yes yeah I just have a couple so I just
 
01:18:09.890 --> 01:18:09.900 align:start position:0%
wanted to point out on this question of
 
01:18:12.590 --> 01:18:12.600 align:start position:0%
the ledge admin responsibility for
 
01:18:15.229 --> 01:18:15.239 align:start position:0%
reviewing old commission so already in
 
01:18:17.390 --> 01:18:17.400 align:start position:0%
our statute house incentive committee
 
01:18:20.209 --> 01:18:20.219 align:start position:0%
services are jointly preparing an
 
01:18:22.189 --> 01:18:22.199 align:start position:0%
updated index of all the commissions
 
01:18:25.189 --> 01:18:25.199 align:start position:0%
with relevant information annually so
 
01:18:27.530 --> 01:18:27.540 align:start position:0%
they're going to be doing that and
 
01:18:31.910 --> 01:18:31.920 align:start position:0%
that's really building on the the charts
 
01:18:33.530 --> 01:18:33.540 align:start position:0%
and everything that we had for our
 
01:18:37.130 --> 01:18:37.140 align:start position:0%
original committee on committees so in
 
01:18:39.229 --> 01:18:39.239 align:start position:0%
some ways just sort of tracking what we
 
01:18:41.149 --> 01:18:41.159 align:start position:0%
did but it was really
 
01:18:44.090 --> 01:18:44.100 align:start position:0%
um it wasn't substantive based at all it
 
01:18:46.189 --> 01:18:46.199 align:start position:0%
was really just an objective review of
 
01:18:50.149 --> 01:18:50.159 align:start position:0%
who was still doing their function the
 
01:18:52.310 --> 01:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
other thing we did do is there are many
 
01:18:53.930 --> 01:18:53.940 align:start position:0%
stat there are many commission
 
01:18:56.209 --> 01:18:56.219 align:start position:0%
requirements or statutes that are flying
 
01:18:58.070 --> 01:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
around out there that need cleaning up
 
01:19:00.770 --> 01:19:00.780 align:start position:0%
so we did a little bit of that the other
 
01:19:02.870 --> 01:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
thing that we did is we redo some
 
01:19:05.689 --> 01:19:05.699 align:start position:0%
legislative membership so you can do
 
01:19:08.030 --> 01:19:08.040 align:start position:0%
some of those sorts of things part of
 
01:19:10.250 --> 01:19:10.260 align:start position:0%
the ledge admin role and I really really
 
01:19:12.530 --> 01:19:12.540 align:start position:0%
think as we make more and more progress
 
01:19:14.990 --> 01:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
we always have our charts updated we
 
01:19:17.689 --> 01:19:17.699 align:start position:0%
have these new rules in place the over
 
01:19:20.510 --> 01:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
time it'll help the speaker's office and
 
01:19:22.490 --> 01:19:22.500 align:start position:0%
we ought to be diminishing in the number
 
01:19:24.590 --> 01:19:24.600 align:start position:0%
of of commissions that are hanging
 
01:19:26.209 --> 01:19:26.219 align:start position:0%
around out there
 
01:19:28.970 --> 01:19:28.980 align:start position:0%
so I guess the only other thing I was
 
01:19:31.550 --> 01:19:31.560 align:start position:0%
really hoping to see from OLS is this
 
01:19:34.010 --> 01:19:34.020 align:start position:0%
sort of template that you guys do use
 
01:19:35.930 --> 01:19:35.940 align:start position:0%
for creating study committee and
 
01:19:38.110 --> 01:19:38.120 align:start position:0%
commissions they have to fill in the
 
01:19:40.490 --> 01:19:40.500 align:start position:0%
blanks you know
 
01:19:43.070 --> 01:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
you had talked about that as sort of a
 
01:19:45.770 --> 01:19:45.780 align:start position:0%
computer I I think it would be really
 
01:19:49.130 --> 01:19:49.140 align:start position:0%
helpful to see a form that's being used
 
01:19:51.890 --> 01:19:51.900 align:start position:0%
that you have to fill in when you're
 
01:19:54.169 --> 01:19:54.179 align:start position:0%
creating one of these things because we
 
01:19:57.290 --> 01:19:57.300 align:start position:0%
have the q q and A's here but sometimes
 
01:20:00.649 --> 01:20:00.659 align:start position:0%
it's good to just see the template the
 
01:20:03.470 --> 01:20:03.480 align:start position:0%
template again that's it's built into
 
01:20:06.770 --> 01:20:06.780 align:start position:0%
the uh software that we use but we can
 
01:20:08.450 --> 01:20:08.460 align:start position:0%
certainly uh
 
01:20:10.910 --> 01:20:10.920 align:start position:0%
print it out bring a print out of that
 
01:20:14.390 --> 01:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
uh that shows uh a bill in process if
 
01:20:16.910 --> 01:20:16.920 align:start position:0%
you will with the the grayed out areas
 
01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:18.350 align:start position:0%
you will with the the grayed out areas
for

01:20:18.350 --> 01:20:18.360 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:20:20.090 --> 01:20:20.100 align:start position:0%
that get filled in
 
01:20:21.590 --> 01:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
it would certainly be good for part of
 
01:20:23.390 --> 01:20:23.400 align:start position:0%
the training yeah well I just think it
 
01:20:25.430 --> 01:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
would be really helpful because then you
 
01:20:27.890 --> 01:20:27.900 align:start position:0%
can see when you know when when
 
01:20:29.689 --> 01:20:29.699 align:start position:0%
somebody's going to go in there to
 
01:20:32.270 --> 01:20:32.280 align:start position:0%
create a committee or commission they're
 
01:20:33.770 --> 01:20:33.780 align:start position:0%
going to be asked every single one of
 
01:20:35.689 --> 01:20:35.699 align:start position:0%
these questions I know they're here too
 
01:20:39.229 --> 01:20:39.239 align:start position:0%
but it's also just nice to see the form
 
01:20:41.090 --> 01:20:41.100 align:start position:0%
it would be how and I think it would be
 
01:20:41.100 --> 01:20:42.709 align:start position:0%
it would be how and I think it would be
helpful

01:20:42.709 --> 01:20:42.719 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
01:20:44.810 --> 01:20:44.820 align:start position:0%
for the committee to see what that looks
 
01:20:44.820 --> 01:20:45.770 align:start position:0%
for the committee to see what that looks
like

01:20:45.770 --> 01:20:45.780 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:20:48.410 --> 01:20:48.420 align:start position:0%
agreed good idea because maybe we're
 
01:20:50.209 --> 01:20:50.219 align:start position:0%
missing something we'll get that out
 
01:20:50.219 --> 01:20:54.770 align:start position:0%
missing something we'll get that out
okay

01:20:54.770 --> 01:20:54.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:05.930 --> 01:21:05.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:08.570 --> 01:21:08.580 align:start position:0%
the next item that we have is um
 
01:21:10.430 --> 01:21:10.440 align:start position:0%
the commissions to review which we
 
01:21:12.950 --> 01:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
handed out to you
 
01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:14.390 align:start position:0%
handed out to you
um

01:21:14.390 --> 01:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:15.790 --> 01:21:15.800 align:start position:0%
and and
 
01:21:18.950 --> 01:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
there were so as we discussed at the
 
01:21:21.290 --> 01:21:21.300 align:start position:0%
last meeting when we were asked to look
 
01:21:24.470 --> 01:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
this up we knew that representative's
 
01:21:27.169 --> 01:21:27.179 align:start position:0%
two studies had
 
01:21:30.410 --> 01:21:30.420 align:start position:0%
pretty much cult as much as possible
 
01:21:32.570 --> 01:21:32.580 align:start position:0%
they had really gone through the list in
 
01:21:33.950 --> 01:21:33.960 align:start position:0%
a very
 
01:21:36.470 --> 01:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
um deliberative and
 
01:21:38.390 --> 01:21:38.400 align:start position:0%
um substantial way and you can see again
 
01:21:40.850 --> 01:21:40.860 align:start position:0%
that's in your binder uh in the reports
 
01:21:41.990 --> 01:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
you see the questionnaire they had
 
01:21:44.750 --> 01:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
submitted to all those groups so when we
 
01:21:46.070 --> 01:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
talked with representative evil we
 
01:21:48.530 --> 01:21:48.540 align:start position:0%
thought there would only be maybe 10 or
 
01:21:52.010 --> 01:21:52.020 align:start position:0%
less and we found five
 
01:21:55.070 --> 01:21:55.080 align:start position:0%
um Deborah does know of a few more that
 
01:21:56.570 --> 01:21:56.580 align:start position:0%
she's going to add to this list so we
 
01:21:59.090 --> 01:21:59.100 align:start position:0%
will be adding a few more but um and we
 
01:22:01.070 --> 01:22:01.080 align:start position:0%
also we didn't and I mentioned the
 
01:22:04.010 --> 01:22:04.020 align:start position:0%
strips of Dolan before we met the oplc
 
01:22:06.770 --> 01:22:06.780 align:start position:0%
once we left as a DNA is examining that
 
01:22:09.470 --> 01:22:09.480 align:start position:0%
right now so we did not add them to this
 
01:22:09.480 --> 01:22:10.910 align:start position:0%
right now so we did not add them to this
list

01:22:10.910 --> 01:22:10.920 align:start position:0%
list
 
01:22:13.970 --> 01:22:13.980 align:start position:0%
um but these are the five right now and
 
01:22:17.689 --> 01:22:17.699 align:start position:0%
uh as you can see we we use the same
 
01:22:20.990 --> 01:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
layout that um representative evils
 
01:22:24.110 --> 01:22:24.120 align:start position:0%
commissioned used and it'll have the
 
01:22:26.810 --> 01:22:26.820 align:start position:0%
year established the associated State
 
01:22:28.910 --> 01:22:28.920 align:start position:0%
Department the agency comments at the
 
01:22:31.490 --> 01:22:31.500 align:start position:0%
time and the notes and then we we added
 
01:22:33.470 --> 01:22:33.480 align:start position:0%
our own staff knowledge so for instance
 
01:22:34.850 --> 01:22:34.860 align:start position:0%
first one of this listed here
 
01:22:37.250 --> 01:22:37.260 align:start position:0%
commissioned to oversee the John G
 
01:22:40.310 --> 01:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
Wynette Memorial we have an expert on it
 
01:22:43.130 --> 01:22:43.140 align:start position:0%
right in the back row who maybe the
 
01:22:44.450 --> 01:22:44.460 align:start position:0%
chair of the committee who may be able
 
01:22:46.669 --> 01:22:46.679 align:start position:0%
to respond to that one
 
01:22:48.709 --> 01:22:48.719 align:start position:0%
um then we have obviously Commission on
 
01:22:50.510 --> 01:22:50.520 align:start position:0%
demographic Trends you can see what's
 
01:22:52.370 --> 01:22:52.380 align:start position:0%
listed there
 
01:22:55.310 --> 01:22:55.320 align:start position:0%
State procurement County State Finance
 
01:22:57.290 --> 01:22:57.300 align:start position:0%
commission and the last one the
 
01:22:58.970 --> 01:22:58.980 align:start position:0%
inter-branch criminal and Juvenile
 
01:23:00.890 --> 01:23:00.900 align:start position:0%
Justice Council which we staffed but
 
01:23:03.590 --> 01:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
then again as we say about everything
 
01:23:06.169 --> 01:23:06.179 align:start position:0%
um after during covid
 
01:23:07.550 --> 01:23:07.560 align:start position:0%
um it
 
01:23:10.070 --> 01:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
we don't know if it broke up or exactly
 
01:23:12.050 --> 01:23:12.060 align:start position:0%
what happened with that so those these
 
01:23:14.209 --> 01:23:14.219 align:start position:0%
are definitely five that we could add to
 
01:23:15.350 --> 01:23:15.360 align:start position:0%
the list
 
01:23:19.610 --> 01:23:19.620 align:start position:0%
and um when it says so we had for the
 
01:23:21.410 --> 01:23:21.420 align:start position:0%
bullets we have to consider with meeting
 
01:23:22.970 --> 01:23:22.980 align:start position:0%
with the chairs one-on-one like you
 
01:23:25.370 --> 01:23:25.380 align:start position:0%
could ask the chairs why if they are in
 
01:23:27.830 --> 01:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
existence or in staff we can you don't
 
01:23:29.570 --> 01:23:29.580 align:start position:0%
have to call them in we can submit a
 
01:23:31.130 --> 01:23:31.140 align:start position:0%
similar questionnaire that represent
 
01:23:33.470 --> 01:23:33.480 align:start position:0%
people have prepared and we could get
 
01:23:35.750 --> 01:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
your approval and and send it out for
 
01:23:37.610 --> 01:23:37.620 align:start position:0%
you and get a response
 
01:23:40.130 --> 01:23:40.140 align:start position:0%
or whatever you choose or if the member
 
01:23:42.290 --> 01:23:42.300 align:start position:0%
is here you could always ask them um in
 
01:23:44.330 --> 01:23:44.340 align:start position:0%
person then
 
01:23:47.090 --> 01:23:47.100 align:start position:0%
um the next bullet is to discuss uh
 
01:23:48.530 --> 01:23:48.540 align:start position:0%
their commissions for the potential
 
01:23:51.070 --> 01:23:51.080 align:start position:0%
repeal if they still need to exist
 
01:23:53.750 --> 01:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
consolidation or to find out what they
 
01:23:56.209 --> 01:23:56.219 align:start position:0%
why they are needed because for instance
 
01:23:56.219 --> 01:23:57.410 align:start position:0%
why they are needed because for instance
one

01:23:57.410 --> 01:23:57.420 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:24:00.350 --> 01:24:00.360 align:start position:0%
uh member suggested well let's let's
 
01:24:03.709 --> 01:24:03.719 align:start position:0%
take um subject matter so say education
 
01:24:06.590 --> 01:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
for instance an education has 20 I'm
 
01:24:08.870 --> 01:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
just using this as an example it's not
 
01:24:11.149 --> 01:24:11.159 align:start position:0%
exact but say education has 20
 
01:24:14.209 --> 01:24:14.219 align:start position:0%
commissions tied to it well 12 of those
 
01:24:17.149 --> 01:24:17.159 align:start position:0%
may be federally required so that's why
 
01:24:18.950 --> 01:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
they're in existence
 
01:24:20.630 --> 01:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
um and you need that to accept federal
 
01:24:23.270 --> 01:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
funds or if similar with HHS so we do
 
01:24:24.890 --> 01:24:24.900 align:start position:0%
know that there are a bunch of those
 
01:24:27.709 --> 01:24:27.719 align:start position:0%
commissions that exist but
 
01:24:31.370 --> 01:24:31.380 align:start position:0%
um have to exist for reasons other than
 
01:24:33.590 --> 01:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
just a study
 
01:24:35.570 --> 01:24:35.580 align:start position:0%
um one thing that Paul mentioned the
 
01:24:39.130 --> 01:24:39.140 align:start position:0%
other we have this new rule the
 
01:24:41.630 --> 01:24:41.640 align:start position:0%
five-year sunset
 
01:24:44.990 --> 01:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
these are all five years old were they
 
01:24:46.550 --> 01:24:46.560 align:start position:0%
would they automatically just Sunset
 
01:24:48.410 --> 01:24:48.420 align:start position:0%
because of that well that law was passed
 
01:24:49.669 --> 01:24:49.679 align:start position:0%
just last year
 
01:24:52.669 --> 01:24:52.679 align:start position:0%
so I don't so I don't know what the
 
01:24:54.950 --> 01:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
point the point of five the five years
 
01:24:54.960 --> 01:24:57.590 align:start position:0%
point the point of five the five years
sunset

01:24:57.590 --> 01:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
sunset
 
01:25:00.169 --> 01:25:00.179 align:start position:0%
yeah perspective I don't we have to we
 
01:25:03.709 --> 01:25:03.719 align:start position:0%
have to find out with each one how that
 
01:25:06.890 --> 01:25:06.900 align:start position:0%
uh fits in so after I I have to read
 
01:25:08.510 --> 01:25:08.520 align:start position:0%
that legislation exactly see how it
 
01:25:10.250 --> 01:25:10.260 align:start position:0%
would apply or the law to see I would
 
01:25:11.990 --> 01:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
apply to this I mean okay it's
 
01:25:14.450 --> 01:25:14.460 align:start position:0%
prospective it's Pro he's naughty it's
 
01:25:16.310 --> 01:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
prospective I mean I think we even
 
01:25:18.530 --> 01:25:18.540 align:start position:0%
talked about that we really couldn't go
 
01:25:21.169 --> 01:25:21.179 align:start position:0%
backwards okay it's prospective okay so
 
01:25:22.550 --> 01:25:22.560 align:start position:0%
it's moving forward
 
01:25:25.130 --> 01:25:25.140 align:start position:0%
so everything is created new which
 
01:25:26.630 --> 01:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
Speaking of created new you have another
 
01:25:29.930 --> 01:25:29.940 align:start position:0%
list in front of you that lists all the
 
01:25:29.940 --> 01:25:30.770 align:start position:0%
list in front of you that lists all the
current

01:25:30.770 --> 01:25:30.780 align:start position:0%
current
 
01:25:33.590 --> 01:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
uh proposals for studies this term I
 
01:25:35.930 --> 01:25:35.940 align:start position:0%
believe the total is 36.
 
01:25:38.209 --> 01:25:38.219 align:start position:0%
eight of which are commissions
 
01:25:40.310 --> 01:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
that will be updated because we just
 
01:25:42.590 --> 01:25:42.600 align:start position:0%
found out about the um
 
01:25:45.770 --> 01:25:45.780 align:start position:0%
the marijuana commission that just came
 
01:25:48.770 --> 01:25:48.780 align:start position:0%
across from the Senate so we will need
 
01:25:50.330 --> 01:25:50.340 align:start position:0%
to add that we will be updating this
 
01:25:52.310 --> 01:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
list but these are all the new proposals
 
01:25:54.890 --> 01:25:54.900 align:start position:0%
by subject area so you'll see that's
 
01:25:58.010 --> 01:25:58.020 align:start position:0%
it's by I believe it's by each committee
 
01:26:01.490 --> 01:26:01.500 align:start position:0%
which approved those studies
 
01:26:01.500 --> 01:26:03.110 align:start position:0%
which approved those studies
um

01:26:03.110 --> 01:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:06.709 --> 01:26:06.719 align:start position:0%
and I know that Deborah plans to
 
01:26:08.209 --> 01:26:08.219 align:start position:0%
um obviously as I mentioned she will
 
01:26:10.250 --> 01:26:10.260 align:start position:0%
update this and there will be another
 
01:26:12.950 --> 01:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
piece where Deborah will be here to talk
 
01:26:14.870 --> 01:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
about the improvements she's been
 
01:26:18.290 --> 01:26:18.300 align:start position:0%
working very closely with it for data
 
01:26:20.270 --> 01:26:20.280 align:start position:0%
cleanup and
 
01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:21.310 align:start position:0%
cleanup and
um

01:26:21.310 --> 01:26:21.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:24.350 --> 01:26:24.360 align:start position:0%
and I.T Solutions because we know that
 
01:26:26.810 --> 01:26:26.820 align:start position:0%
that's where this all sits in helping us
 
01:26:29.629 --> 01:26:29.639 align:start position:0%
track all of these and
 
01:26:32.330 --> 01:26:32.340 align:start position:0%
um as we've mentioned before
 
01:26:34.070 --> 01:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
the staff has been working very
 
01:26:37.250 --> 01:26:37.260 align:start position:0%
diligently in the background to make
 
01:26:39.770 --> 01:26:39.780 align:start position:0%
sure that we look at every aspect and as
 
01:26:41.450 --> 01:26:41.460 align:start position:0%
each office is working on something and
 
01:26:43.189 --> 01:26:43.199 align:start position:0%
also we cross over create something that
 
01:26:45.410 --> 01:26:45.420 align:start position:0%
another office could utilize we're
 
01:26:47.629 --> 01:26:47.639 align:start position:0%
trying to keep all those lines of
 
01:26:49.550 --> 01:26:49.560 align:start position:0%
communication and meetings where we can
 
01:26:53.149 --> 01:26:53.159 align:start position:0%
fit them in while working the middle of
 
01:26:57.050 --> 01:26:57.060 align:start position:0%
the our current legislative cycle we
 
01:26:57.060 --> 01:26:57.970 align:start position:0%
the our current legislative cycle we
also

01:26:57.970 --> 01:26:57.980 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:27:00.229 --> 01:27:00.239 align:start position:0%
in the hospital Services we're going to
 
01:27:02.270 --> 01:27:02.280 align:start position:0%
be working with Dave we came up with
 
01:27:05.810 --> 01:27:05.820 align:start position:0%
some um another proposal which is a
 
01:27:07.729 --> 01:27:07.739 align:start position:0%
questionnaire we just did a dummy
 
01:27:10.189 --> 01:27:10.199 align:start position:0%
questionnaire that could be utilized and
 
01:27:12.110 --> 01:27:12.120 align:start position:0%
it it incorporates it's it's a Google
 
01:27:13.850 --> 01:27:13.860 align:start position:0%
Docs it would be electronic it
 
01:27:16.610 --> 01:27:16.620 align:start position:0%
incorporates many of the questions that
 
01:27:20.090 --> 01:27:20.100 align:start position:0%
we had in that HCS profile that we
 
01:27:22.129 --> 01:27:22.139 align:start position:0%
provide for you earlier and we'll work
 
01:27:23.990 --> 01:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
with Dave to see how that could be
 
01:27:26.990 --> 01:27:27.000 align:start position:0%
utilized in getting the information
 
01:27:30.770 --> 01:27:30.780 align:start position:0%
um for future legislation but it's it's
 
01:27:30.780 --> 01:27:31.370 align:start position:0%
um for future legislation but it's it's
um

01:27:31.370 --> 01:27:31.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:33.530 --> 01:27:33.540 align:start position:0%
items like that that we're trying to
 
01:27:35.450 --> 01:27:35.460 align:start position:0%
make sure all of our offices are
 
01:27:36.950 --> 01:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
coordinate because
 
01:27:39.830 --> 01:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
we don't want to what we did find out is
 
01:27:41.570 --> 01:27:41.580 align:start position:0%
that many offices in the past we were
 
01:27:44.270 --> 01:27:44.280 align:start position:0%
all working in our our own silos and we
 
01:27:45.950 --> 01:27:45.960 align:start position:0%
really need to
 
01:27:49.010 --> 01:27:49.020 align:start position:0%
um because we have we have a good staff
 
01:27:50.750 --> 01:27:50.760 align:start position:0%
but we're limited and so we need to make
 
01:27:52.910 --> 01:27:52.920 align:start position:0%
sure that we're utilizing all of our
 
01:27:57.050 --> 01:27:57.060 align:start position:0%
resources to um best possible solutions
 
01:27:57.060 --> 01:27:58.370 align:start position:0%
resources to um best possible solutions
so

01:27:58.370 --> 01:27:58.380 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:27:58.380 --> 01:27:59.090 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:27:59.090 --> 01:27:59.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:02.149 --> 01:28:02.159 align:start position:0%
anyway I think that's all that we had
 
01:28:03.649 --> 01:28:03.659 align:start position:0%
Aaron did you think of anything else
 
01:28:06.649 --> 01:28:06.659 align:start position:0%
that we needed to add today
 
01:28:10.310 --> 01:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
okay so I think we're all set and um I I
 
01:28:12.169 --> 01:28:12.179 align:start position:0%
Deborah will probably get in touch with
 
01:28:13.669 --> 01:28:13.679 align:start position:0%
us if there's other items that she
 
01:28:16.610 --> 01:28:16.620 align:start position:0%
wanted us to add to today I know that at
 
01:28:18.229 --> 01:28:18.239 align:start position:0%
the last meeting you had just asked us
 
01:28:21.050 --> 01:28:21.060 align:start position:0%
to come up with the items that we've
 
01:28:24.110 --> 01:28:24.120 align:start position:0%
shared with you but as the staff started
 
01:28:26.149 --> 01:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
working on everything we're coming up
 
01:28:28.010 --> 01:28:28.020 align:start position:0%
with all these ideas and then we asked
 
01:28:30.110 --> 01:28:30.120 align:start position:0%
can we have one more week because as I
 
01:28:32.209 --> 01:28:32.219 align:start position:0%
mentioned sometimes just those four days
 
01:28:34.610 --> 01:28:34.620 align:start position:0%
between your two meetings
 
01:28:37.129 --> 01:28:37.139 align:start position:0%
um we're scrambling but we wanted to
 
01:28:39.530 --> 01:28:39.540 align:start position:0%
present a good product to you again that
 
01:28:41.689 --> 01:28:41.699 align:start position:0%
can be utilized and hopefully answer
 
01:28:43.850 --> 01:28:43.860 align:start position:0%
your questions not meet for two weeks so
 
01:28:47.270 --> 01:28:47.280 align:start position:0%
is that is there more that
 
01:28:49.910 --> 01:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
it needs to be done for you guys to come
 
01:28:52.610 --> 01:28:52.620 align:start position:0%
back in two weeks or I I think that um
 
01:28:54.530 --> 01:28:54.540 align:start position:0%
we'll talk with Deborah as we'll give
 
01:28:56.510 --> 01:28:56.520 align:start position:0%
you a report on the I.T Solutions and
 
01:28:58.370 --> 01:28:58.380 align:start position:0%
we'll work with a house key Services
 
01:29:01.270 --> 01:29:01.280 align:start position:0%
we'll work with um legislative services
 
01:29:03.050 --> 01:29:03.060 align:start position:0%
and and
 
01:29:05.629 --> 01:29:05.639 align:start position:0%
um fill in some of those gaps and you
 
01:29:08.390 --> 01:29:08.400 align:start position:0%
just we will so your list that you have
 
01:29:11.090 --> 01:29:11.100 align:start position:0%
will be updated of the five will add
 
01:29:12.530 --> 01:29:12.540 align:start position:0%
more to that
 
01:29:14.270 --> 01:29:14.280 align:start position:0%
um we'll have a proposed list of
 
01:29:16.910 --> 01:29:16.920 align:start position:0%
questions that you may want us to send
 
01:29:19.129 --> 01:29:19.139 align:start position:0%
to the chairs of those commissions
 
01:29:20.750 --> 01:29:20.760 align:start position:0%
unless you want them to come in and
 
01:29:22.550 --> 01:29:22.560 align:start position:0%
speak with you
 
01:29:22.560 --> 01:29:25.669 align:start position:0%
speak with you
um

01:29:25.669 --> 01:29:25.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:29.629 --> 01:29:29.639 align:start position:0%
I mean we we had people the people come
 
01:29:29.639 --> 01:29:30.649 align:start position:0%
I mean we we had people the people come
in

01:29:30.649 --> 01:29:30.659 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:29:32.930 --> 01:29:32.940 align:start position:0%
but what we did actually we had the
 
01:29:35.570 --> 01:29:35.580 align:start position:0%
agency come in that the thing that they
 
01:29:37.310 --> 01:29:37.320 align:start position:0%
were associated with
 
01:29:41.030 --> 01:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
and usually the chair or something
 
01:29:43.310 --> 01:29:43.320 align:start position:0%
and what we usually did was we also
 
01:29:45.410 --> 01:29:45.420 align:start position:0%
checked with the chairs of the standing
 
01:29:47.570 --> 01:29:47.580 align:start position:0%
committees if they had any
 
01:29:51.290 --> 01:29:51.300 align:start position:0%
uh ideas on things which I was just
 
01:29:52.910 --> 01:29:52.920 align:start position:0%
going to say and I don't know how hard
 
01:29:54.350 --> 01:29:54.360 align:start position:0%
it would be but
 
01:29:56.209 --> 01:29:56.219 align:start position:0%
I think it'd be really useful to have
 
01:29:58.370 --> 01:29:58.380 align:start position:0%
another column on this chart for the
 
01:30:00.410 --> 01:30:00.420 align:start position:0%
standing committee that's responsible
 
01:30:04.430 --> 01:30:04.440 align:start position:0%
for the policy yes people do that no the
 
01:30:07.970 --> 01:30:07.980 align:start position:0%
the standing policy committee that's
 
01:30:10.370 --> 01:30:10.380 align:start position:0%
associated with these but that that's
 
01:30:12.890 --> 01:30:12.900 align:start position:0%
the five list of the five yes we will do
 
01:30:15.709 --> 01:30:15.719 align:start position:0%
that yeah I agree and if we wanted to
 
01:30:17.810 --> 01:30:17.820 align:start position:0%
check or you know that would also be
 
01:30:20.209 --> 01:30:20.219 align:start position:0%
useful on an ongoing basis for standing
 
01:30:22.550 --> 01:30:22.560 align:start position:0%
committees who get this whole big chart
 
01:30:25.070 --> 01:30:25.080 align:start position:0%
so they can zero in on what their
 
01:30:26.990 --> 01:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
response is yes we will do that you can
 
01:30:28.669 --> 01:30:28.679 align:start position:0%
cut it by committee too
 
01:30:32.470 --> 01:30:32.480 align:start position:0%
yes yeah yeah that's another
 
01:30:35.750 --> 01:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
well yeah you could reformat the just
 
01:30:39.410 --> 01:30:39.420 align:start position:0%
the kitchen I wonder if the
 
01:30:42.110 --> 01:30:42.120 align:start position:0%
standing committee shares know what
 
01:30:44.149 --> 01:30:44.159 align:start position:0%
their responsibilities are I know what
 
01:30:45.169 --> 01:30:45.179 align:start position:0%
they're doing
 
01:30:47.390 --> 01:30:47.400 align:start position:0%
what they're associated with well that
 
01:30:49.310 --> 01:30:49.320 align:start position:0%
is one of the other charges that you
 
01:30:50.930 --> 01:30:50.940 align:start position:0%
gave to us last week so that's we're
 
01:30:53.750 --> 01:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
trying to do with that the entire report
 
01:30:56.209 --> 01:30:56.219 align:start position:0%
is trying to break it down and that's an
 
01:30:58.010 --> 01:30:58.020 align:start position:0%
I.T component that we're working on so
 
01:31:00.530 --> 01:31:00.540 align:start position:0%
education will have that 20 but then
 
01:31:02.330 --> 01:31:02.340 align:start position:0%
we'll also have a column in there that
 
01:31:02.340 --> 01:31:03.470 align:start position:0%
we'll also have a column in there that
says

01:31:03.470 --> 01:31:03.480 align:start position:0%
says
 
01:31:05.750 --> 01:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
federally required or whatever that may
 
01:31:05.760 --> 01:31:15.530 align:start position:0%
federally required or whatever that may
be

01:31:15.530 --> 01:31:15.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:17.629 --> 01:31:17.639 align:start position:0%
okay I'm representative Wilhelm has a
 
01:31:17.639 --> 01:31:18.290 align:start position:0%
okay I'm representative Wilhelm has a
question

01:31:18.290 --> 01:31:18.300 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:31:21.950 --> 01:31:21.960 align:start position:0%
just a quick one do you already in one
 
01:31:23.930 --> 01:31:23.940 align:start position:0%
of your spreadsheets already have
 
01:31:23.940 --> 01:31:25.550 align:start position:0%
of your spreadsheets already have
uh

01:31:25.550 --> 01:31:25.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:31:28.129 --> 01:31:28.139 align:start position:0%
indication of which which commissions
 
01:31:30.950 --> 01:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
are federally mandated
 
01:31:34.129 --> 01:31:34.139 align:start position:0%
yes they they there are some that's how
 
01:31:35.990 --> 01:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
we found out when represent people did
 
01:31:39.290 --> 01:31:39.300 align:start position:0%
her study and that's where we um
 
01:31:41.209 --> 01:31:41.219 align:start position:0%
that so that should be there but we have
 
01:31:43.729 --> 01:31:43.739 align:start position:0%
to be but we've had so many
 
01:31:45.709 --> 01:31:45.719 align:start position:0%
different charts since then that's why
 
01:31:47.689 --> 01:31:47.699 align:start position:0%
we want to have this final absolute
 
01:31:51.050 --> 01:31:51.060 align:start position:0%
chart generated from I.T not from House
 
01:31:52.790 --> 01:31:52.800 align:start position:0%
of Beauty services in the Senate clerk's
 
01:31:54.530 --> 01:31:54.540 align:start position:0%
office and then the speaker's office we
 
01:31:57.169 --> 01:31:57.179 align:start position:0%
want one master chart that every office
 
01:31:58.970 --> 01:31:58.980 align:start position:0%
will refer to so that's what we're
 
01:32:01.490 --> 01:32:01.500 align:start position:0%
building is taking a while to build that
 
01:32:03.649 --> 01:32:03.659 align:start position:0%
right so one of those columns would be
 
01:32:05.810 --> 01:32:05.820 align:start position:0%
Federal and that way we make sure that
 
01:32:06.830 --> 01:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
we're not
 
01:32:09.890 --> 01:32:09.900 align:start position:0%
going back and eliminating a federally
 
01:32:12.169 --> 01:32:12.179 align:start position:0%
mandated so there's a column here that
 
01:32:15.110 --> 01:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
has the statutory citation so maybe
 
01:32:17.629 --> 01:32:17.639 align:start position:0%
that's maybe where you could fill it in
 
01:32:20.629 --> 01:32:20.639 align:start position:0%
so it's funny I see County State Finance
 
01:32:23.209 --> 01:32:23.219 align:start position:0%
on this this is when I frequently when
 
01:32:25.310 --> 01:32:25.320 align:start position:0%
I've referred to one that has never met
 
01:32:27.410 --> 01:32:27.420 align:start position:0%
for eons
 
01:32:31.550 --> 01:32:31.560 align:start position:0%
but that DHHS made a strong argument for
 
01:32:33.229 --> 01:32:33.239 align:start position:0%
keeping because sometimes they're just
 
01:32:33.239 --> 01:32:35.209 align:start position:0%
keeping because sometimes they're just
needed

01:32:35.209 --> 01:32:35.219 align:start position:0%
needed
 
01:32:38.810 --> 01:32:38.820 align:start position:0%
so I don't know what they'll say now but
 
01:32:41.810 --> 01:32:41.820 align:start position:0%
that that was the uh that was the one I
 
01:32:44.209 --> 01:32:44.219 align:start position:0%
was just just as far as listening and
 
01:32:47.870 --> 01:32:47.880 align:start position:0%
keeping standing committees apprised it
 
01:32:49.910 --> 01:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
would be good if the chairs or the
 
01:32:51.830 --> 01:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
Committees had like a running list of
 
01:32:53.689 --> 01:32:53.699 align:start position:0%
all the study committees there they've
 
01:32:53.699 --> 01:32:54.770 align:start position:0%
all the study committees there they've
approved

01:32:54.770 --> 01:32:54.780 align:start position:0%
approved
 
01:32:57.470 --> 01:32:57.480 align:start position:0%
for the house you know like during the
 
01:33:00.110 --> 01:33:00.120 align:start position:0%
course of a term so they could see
 
01:33:02.450 --> 01:33:02.460 align:start position:0%
something like this that's why we did
 
01:33:04.370 --> 01:33:04.380 align:start position:0%
that one of my earlier earliest comments
 
01:33:07.370 --> 01:33:07.380 align:start position:0%
was that that mapping exercise
 
01:33:10.490 --> 01:33:10.500 align:start position:0%
to map them all in so they're and also
 
01:33:11.930 --> 01:33:11.940 align:start position:0%
that would help us identify any
 
01:33:13.669 --> 01:33:13.679 align:start position:0%
warfarins that are out there that that
 
01:33:16.729 --> 01:33:16.739 align:start position:0%
aren't recognized by by the Committees
 
01:33:18.890 --> 01:33:18.900 align:start position:0%
that they have responsibility
 
01:33:21.189 --> 01:33:21.199 align:start position:0%
and and as you know when you change
 
01:33:23.330 --> 01:33:23.340 align:start position:0%
administrations or so you have new
 
01:33:25.790 --> 01:33:25.800 align:start position:0%
chairs there's continuity like
 
01:33:27.950 --> 01:33:27.960 align:start position:0%
representative hunt knows everything
 
01:33:30.290 --> 01:33:30.300 align:start position:0%
um yes it all memorize but when you have
 
01:33:32.450 --> 01:33:32.460 align:start position:0%
some committees have had chairs a
 
01:33:35.689 --> 01:33:35.699 align:start position:0%
constant change that continuity can get
 
01:33:37.610 --> 01:33:37.620 align:start position:0%
lost right
 
01:33:39.709 --> 01:33:39.719 align:start position:0%
well then that's part of the I that's
 
01:33:41.450 --> 01:33:41.460 align:start position:0%
part of the idea with building this
 
01:33:43.310 --> 01:33:43.320 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and these new systems
 
01:33:47.090 --> 01:33:47.100 align:start position:0%
we've got to build uh continuity into
 
01:33:47.100 --> 01:33:47.990 align:start position:0%
we've got to build uh continuity into
the

01:33:47.990 --> 01:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:33:51.050 --> 01:33:51.060 align:start position:0%
program so exactly things aren't lost
 
01:33:54.649 --> 01:33:54.659 align:start position:0%
from from change to change
 
01:33:58.209 --> 01:33:58.219 align:start position:0%
I have faith we'll do it
 
01:34:01.910 --> 01:34:01.920 align:start position:0%
thank you any last com comments or
 
01:34:05.570 --> 01:34:05.580 align:start position:0%

01:34:20.290 --> 01:34:20.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:23.209 --> 01:34:23.219 align:start position:0%
oh so we're gonna wait for more from
 
01:34:25.669 --> 01:34:25.679 align:start position:0%
Deborah and then we can sort of make a
 
01:34:28.510 --> 01:34:28.520 align:start position:0%
plan on what we want to do with the
 
01:34:34.550 --> 01:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:36.950 --> 01:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
to any last comments
 
01:34:38.930 --> 01:34:38.940 align:start position:0%
where our next meeting is going to be
 
01:34:41.450 --> 01:34:41.460 align:start position:0%
two weeks from today because of Memorial
 
01:34:53.290 --> 01:34:53.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:56.470 --> 01:34:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:00.590 --> 01:35:00.600 align:start position:0%
yeah it sounds like a good time
 
01:35:02.149 --> 01:35:02.159 align:start position:0%
look at how many people we got here
 
01:35:02.159 --> 01:35:05.030 align:start position:0%
look at how many people we got here
today

01:35:05.030 --> 01:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:07.669 --> 01:35:07.679 align:start position:0%
and it gives everybody a chance so get
 
01:35:10.189 --> 01:35:10.199 align:start position:0%
their stuff together on Monday morning
 
01:35:14.209 --> 01:35:14.219 align:start position:0%
because sometimes I used to come in and
 
01:35:16.370 --> 01:35:16.380 align:start position:0%
yeah if you can't full time if you can't
 
01:35:19.669 --> 01:35:19.679 align:start position:0%
make it please let me know because in
 
01:35:21.470 --> 01:35:21.480 align:start position:0%
case where it's questionable whether we
 
01:35:22.970 --> 01:35:22.980 align:start position:0%
get a quorum or not I hate to drag
 
01:35:24.709 --> 01:35:24.719 align:start position:0%
people to concrete just to send them
 
01:35:26.810 --> 01:35:26.820 align:start position:0%
back on me I can tell you already I
 
01:35:29.030 --> 01:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
won't be here
 
01:35:31.370 --> 01:35:31.380 align:start position:0%
I hope everybody
 
01:35:35.270 --> 01:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
