group called granite
 
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
advantage the medicaid expansion group

breaking that 86 000 individuals down
 
00:07:27.599 --> 00:07:29.830 align:start position:0%
breaking that 86 000 individuals down
about

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:29.840 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:34.240 align:start position:0%
28 615 individuals
 
00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:36.400 align:start position:0%
um we have information that would
 
00:07:39.029 --> 00:07:39.039 align:start position:0%
suggest that um
 
00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:40.720 align:start position:0%
barring any new information to us that
 
00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:42.800 align:start position:0%
they would lose eligibility that they no
 
00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
longer would continue to to qualify
 
00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
and another 55 000 that are at risk
 
00:07:50.629 --> 00:07:50.639 align:start position:0%
because of
 
00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
um overdue redeterminations individuals
 
00:07:55.749 --> 00:07:55.759 align:start position:0%
weren't required to do redeterminations
 
00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:56.720 align:start position:0%
during the
 
00:07:58.710 --> 00:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
aren't required to do redeterminations
 
00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
during the public health emergency
 
00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:03.280 align:start position:0%
and we've been doing
 
00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:04.800 align:start position:0%
a variety of
 
00:08:06.469 --> 00:08:06.479 align:start position:0%
outreach efforts which are kind of
 
00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:08.560 align:start position:0%
outlined on the
 
00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:10.240 align:start position:0%
bottom here and over on the right hand
 
00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:11.840 align:start position:0%
side i won't go into all that unless you
 
00:08:13.189 --> 00:08:13.199 align:start position:0%
have questions
 
00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
subsequently but just suffice it to say
 
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.029 align:start position:0%
subsequently but just suffice it to say
if

00:08:17.029 --> 00:08:17.039 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:08:18.629 --> 00:08:18.639 align:start position:0%
you have constituents that are reaching
 
00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:20.800 align:start position:0%
out to you on this matter we're we are
 
00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:22.400 align:start position:0%
here to help we want to make sure at the
 
00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:24.160 align:start position:0%
end of the public health emergency that
 
00:08:26.869 --> 00:08:26.879 align:start position:0%
all those who should remain on medicaid
 
00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:29.840 align:start position:0%
who are eligible do so and to help those
 
00:08:31.589 --> 00:08:31.599 align:start position:0%
who aren't able to
 
00:08:33.509 --> 00:08:33.519 align:start position:0%
remain eligible for medicaid to look at
 
00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
so other legislation that we expect to
 
00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:49.360 align:start position:0%
to potentially talk to you about uh we
 
00:08:51.269 --> 00:08:51.279 align:start position:0%
understand there's two bills
 
00:08:51.279 --> 00:08:52.310 align:start position:0%
understand there's two bills
um

00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:52.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
taking advantage of the american rescue
 
00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:56.389 align:start position:0%
taking advantage of the american rescue
plan

00:08:56.389 --> 00:08:56.399 align:start position:0%
plan
 
00:08:59.190 --> 00:08:59.200 align:start position:0%
to extend postpartum coverage from 60
 
00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:01.760 align:start position:0%
days to 12 months
 
00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
post a delivery of a baby and there i
 
00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:05.509 align:start position:0%
post a delivery of a baby and there i
think

00:09:05.509 --> 00:09:05.519 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:07.360 align:start position:0%
again i won't get into this but there
 
00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:09.200 align:start position:0%
are i think
 
00:09:10.949 --> 00:09:10.959 align:start position:0%
interesting public health reasons as to
 
00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:12.800 align:start position:0%
why that that might be a good thing to
 
00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.710 align:start position:0%
why that that might be a good thing to
do

00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:14.720 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:16.720 align:start position:0%
we're also working on
 
00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:18.800 align:start position:0%
implementing the
 
00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
home and community based services
 
00:09:23.829 --> 00:09:23.839 align:start position:0%
spending plan which was another feature
 
00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:09:26.949 --> 00:09:26.959 align:start position:0%
american rescue plan which provided
 
00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
enhanced one-time enhanced federal match
 
00:09:33.509 --> 00:09:33.519 align:start position:0%
of 10 percent to support
 
00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
services provided on in the hcbs setting
 
00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:38.150 align:start position:0%
services provided on in the hcbs setting
um

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:38.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
the fifth issue which i'm
 
00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:42.640 align:start position:0%
you know particularly concerned about
 
00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
and there's at least one or two bills
 
00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
that address
 
00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
this i think out there avoiding
 
00:09:50.949 --> 00:09:50.959 align:start position:0%
the collapse of maternity care options
 
00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
in the northern and western parts of new
 
00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:56.389 align:start position:0%
in the northern and western parts of new
hampshire

00:09:56.389 --> 00:09:56.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:57.910 --> 00:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
coming out of this committee a bill that
 
00:09:59.750 --> 00:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
was passed from a policy standpoint but
 
00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:01.600 align:start position:0%
funding has been suspended as the in and
 
00:10:03.509 --> 00:10:03.519 align:start position:0%
out medicaid option i know
 
00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:05.120 align:start position:0%
representative snow has been in contact
 
00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
with me on that many times
 
00:10:10.069 --> 00:10:10.079 align:start position:0%
of course medicaid rates inevitably
 
00:10:11.829 --> 00:10:11.839 align:start position:0%
you'll hear about those in particular i
 
00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:13.200 align:start position:0%
think for
 
00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
for nursing facilities and home and
 
00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
community based services
 
00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:19.360 align:start position:0%

waivers and state plan amendments two of
 
00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
which we're working on right now
 
00:10:32.389 --> 00:10:32.399 align:start position:0%
as a
 
00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
a waiver is the inpatient psychiatric
 
00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:38.000 align:start position:0%

that we are guided by
 
00:17:07.189 --> 00:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
a stakeholder process that developed
 
00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:10.720 align:start position:0%
plans that really lay out our work so we

affairs committee
 
00:21:13.669 --> 00:21:13.679 align:start position:0%
like most legislation after passage the

but respects the life of a mother who
 
00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
has been placed in these rare
 
00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
unfortunate circumstances through no
 
00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
fault of her own
 
00:21:57.029 --> 00:21:57.039 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's laws need to reflect the
 
00:21:59.430 --> 00:21:59.440 align:start position:0%
daily realities that many granite
 
00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:01.280 align:start position:0%
staters are facing
 
00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
currently the field protection act does
 
00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:06.640 align:start position:0%
not consider these rare and extenuating
 
00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:09.350 align:start position:0%
not consider these rare and extenuating
circumstances

00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:11.440 align:start position:0%
the fetal protection act places very
 
00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:13.280 align:start position:0%
challenging restrictions upon young
 
00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:16.640 align:start position:0%
girls and creates an undue burden
 
00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:19.360 align:start position:0%
these are young girls whose fathers male
 
00:22:22.149 --> 00:22:22.159 align:start position:0%
guardians or brothers may have raped
 
00:22:22.159 --> 00:22:22.950 align:start position:0%
guardians or brothers may have raped
them

00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:22:25.669 --> 00:22:25.679 align:start position:0%
creating a very specific unusual
 
00:22:25.679 --> 00:22:27.350 align:start position:0%
creating a very specific unusual
circumstance

00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:27.360 align:start position:0%
circumstance
 
00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
these young girls may have struggled to
 
00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:32.480 align:start position:0%
break free from their abuser and rapist
 
00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:35.440 align:start position:0%
and may need to go to court for a waiver
 
00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire should not
 
00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
establish a timeline for girls to gain
 
00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:42.720 align:start position:0%
the courage and resources to get away
 
00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
from their abuser and rapist and safely
 
00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
make their own decision
 
00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:50.480 align:start position:0%
the field protection act i believe may
 
00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
violate the u.s supreme court's undue
 
00:22:55.669 --> 00:22:55.679 align:start position:0%
burden standard at least in the case of
 
00:22:58.149 --> 00:22:58.159 align:start position:0%
preventing a rape girl from getting an
 
00:22:58.159 --> 00:22:59.750 align:start position:0%
preventing a rape girl from getting an
abortion

00:22:59.750 --> 00:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
abortion
 
00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:00.870 align:start position:0%
abortion
also

00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:00.880 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:03.200 align:start position:0%
the act is quite possibly in violation
 
00:23:04.789 --> 00:23:04.799 align:start position:0%
of article 2b
 
00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
of the new hampshire constitution's bill
 
00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
of rights
 
00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:12.400 align:start position:0%
a young girl being raped by such as her
 
00:23:15.029 --> 00:23:15.039 align:start position:0%
father or another family member is one
 
00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
of the most horrific acts that we can
 
00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:18.470 align:start position:0%
of the most horrific acts that we can
imagine

00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
imagine
 
00:23:21.029 --> 00:23:21.039 align:start position:0%
how would you react if that was your
 
00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
daughter sister or even one of your best
 
00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:24.310 align:start position:0%
daughter sister or even one of your best
friends

00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:24.320 align:start position:0%
friends
 
00:23:26.549 --> 00:23:26.559 align:start position:0%
think about it and now put yourself in
 
00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
that young girl's position
 
00:23:31.909 --> 00:23:31.919 align:start position:0%
these girls often cannot get away from
 
00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
their abuser and need our help
 
00:23:37.909 --> 00:23:37.919 align:start position:0%
this abuser usually is a father or male
 
00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
parental guardian
 
00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:41.200 align:start position:0%
this makes accessing
 
00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
medical procedures earlier in the
 
00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:46.240 align:start position:0%
pregnancy nearly impossible
 
00:23:48.549 --> 00:23:48.559 align:start position:0%
sometimes it can take months for victims
 
00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
to break free from their abuses
 
00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
should our laws punish people who cannot
 
00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:56.240 align:start position:0%
be free from abuse to make their own
 
00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:57.909 align:start position:0%
be free from abuse to make their own
decisions

00:23:57.909 --> 00:23:57.919 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
00:23:59.750 --> 00:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
should the state of new hampshire be
 
00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
mandating raped women carry a pregnancy
 
00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:04.400 align:start position:0%
to term
 
00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
under 1609 raped women are not given a
 
00:24:11.549 --> 00:24:11.559 align:start position:0%
choice but must continue their pregnancy
 
00:24:15.029 --> 00:24:15.039 align:start position:0%
1609 allows that choice
 
00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
it is not requiring abortions but
 
00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
allowing choice
 
00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:22.400 align:start position:0%
the existing law requires ultrasounds to
 
00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:24.880 align:start position:0%
be performed on a young woman
 
00:24:27.269 --> 00:24:27.279 align:start position:0%
before any abortion
 
00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:29.200 align:start position:0%
how much more are we going to make a
 
00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:32.240 align:start position:0%
young girl suffer that has been raped or
 
00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:35.360 align:start position:0%
incestually attacked by a relative
 
00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
house bill 1609 removes this unnecessary
 
00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:40.870 align:start position:0%
house bill 1609 removes this unnecessary
mandate

00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:40.880 align:start position:0%
mandate
 
00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:43.120 align:start position:0%
medical decisions like these after such
 
00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
traumatic experiences are incredibly
 
00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
personal decisions between a possibly
 
00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:51.440 align:start position:0%
pregnant young girl and her doctor and
 
00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:53.360 align:start position:0%
perhaps her clergy
 
00:24:55.909 --> 00:24:55.919 align:start position:0%
i do not believe that this is a decision
 
00:24:58.830 --> 00:24:58.840 align:start position:0%
for 424 volunteer
 
00:25:01.269 --> 00:25:01.279 align:start position:0%
legislators of which
 
00:25:03.669 --> 00:25:03.679 align:start position:0%
nearly none have the maternal and
 
00:25:07.669 --> 00:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
dramatic health care expertise to make
 
00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:11.120 align:start position:0%
this legislation is not pro-abortion
 
00:25:14.470 --> 00:25:14.480 align:start position:0%
but it is supportive of rape and incest
 
00:25:17.029 --> 00:25:17.039 align:start position:0%
victims and young girls dealing with
 
00:25:19.029 --> 00:25:19.039 align:start position:0%
extreme trauma
 
00:25:21.669 --> 00:25:21.679 align:start position:0%
we are protecting life by leaving the
 
00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
existing abortion ban in place but we
 
00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
are also considering the realities of
 
00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
daily life in the granite state
 
00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:32.480 align:start position:0%
i hope you'll listen to what i've said
 
00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:37.200 align:start position:0%

uh we're here we are here to speak
 
00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
specifically to section four of the bill
 
00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:14.480 align:start position:0%
which requires the department to cut
 
00:27:16.789 --> 00:27:16.799 align:start position:0%
collect up uh pregnancy termination
 
00:27:18.789 --> 00:27:18.799 align:start position:0%
statistics so that's the scope of what
 
00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for giving us this
 
00:27:26.710 --> 00:27:26.720 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak about the reporting
 
00:27:29.269 --> 00:27:29.279 align:start position:0%
piece uh we have ident there are two
 
00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:31.840 align:start position:0%
pieces two big pieces identified in this
 
00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
bill uh one is reporting from the
 
00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:36.640 align:start position:0%
providers we don't have currently have
 
00:27:39.029 --> 00:27:39.039 align:start position:0%
any system that allows the providers to
 
00:27:41.269 --> 00:27:41.279 align:start position:0%
report directly to us so we would have
 
00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
to create a new system to get that
 
00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:45.440 align:start position:0%
information and this has to be hipaa
 
00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
protected so that's a privacy and
 
00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
liability those have to be built into
 
00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:51.520 align:start position:0%
the system currently there is no
 
00:27:54.149 --> 00:27:54.159 align:start position:0%
appropriation set for set forth for
 
00:27:56.630 --> 00:27:56.640 align:start position:0%
creating that system that's one part of
 
00:27:58.870 --> 00:27:58.880 align:start position:0%
it the other part is we also have to
 
00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
have other data systems that has to be
 
00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
in place that mr chavla will be talking

00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:12.320 align:start position:0%
sorry i need to stretch my body
 
00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:14.320 align:start position:0%
so currently the indicator of
 
00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:18.480 align:start position:0%
termination of pregnancy after 24 weeks
 
00:28:20.789 --> 00:28:20.799 align:start position:0%
gestational age is not currently
 
00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
available in the dhhs data portal

formerly new hampshire health wisdom
 
00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:26.950 align:start position:0%
formerly new hampshire health wisdom
system

00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:26.960 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:28:29.029 --> 00:28:29.039 align:start position:0%
in order to do so you will require
 
00:28:31.909 --> 00:28:31.919 align:start position:0%
additional resource workforce for the
 
00:28:35.029 --> 00:28:35.039 align:start position:0%
division to do the data analysis and
 
00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:37.360 align:start position:0%
visualization to conduct statistical
 
00:28:39.669 --> 00:28:39.679 align:start position:0%
reporting for this purpose
 
00:28:42.149 --> 00:28:42.159 align:start position:0%
so i would like to give some
 
00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:44.480 align:start position:0%
information from the bureau bureau of
 
00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
health statistics currently staffing
 
00:28:49.909 --> 00:28:49.919 align:start position:0%
limitation so the bureau of health
 
00:28:52.389 --> 00:28:52.399 align:start position:0%
statistics provides data analysis and
 
00:28:56.070 --> 00:28:56.080 align:start position:0%
epidemiological statistical support uh
 
00:28:58.470 --> 00:28:58.480 align:start position:0%
as the health statistics center of new
 
00:28:58.480 --> 00:28:59.830 align:start position:0%
as the health statistics center of new
hampshire

00:28:59.830 --> 00:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
and um depending on the data
 
00:29:04.789 --> 00:29:04.799 align:start position:0%
availability this type of report will
 
00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:06.880 align:start position:0%
need to be customized
 
00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:07.990 align:start position:0%
need to be customized
and

00:29:07.990 --> 00:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:10.000 align:start position:0%
with the limited resource country the
 
00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
bureau has
 
00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
we don't have enough
 
00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:16.240 align:start position:0%
staff to provide this type of customized
 
00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
data modeling data virtualization and
 
00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:20.640 align:start position:0%
data analysis currently the bureau only
 
00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:23.440 align:start position:0%
has one full time data analyst as well
 
00:29:25.590 --> 00:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
as the one full time system developed
 
00:29:27.510 --> 00:29:27.520 align:start position:0%
developer in order to do the
 
00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:36.389 --> 00:29:36.399 align:start position:0%
we are here to take any other questions
 
00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
you might have from the committee
 
00:29:47.029 --> 00:29:47.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:49.120 align:start position:0%
um mine is a simple question i need your
 
00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:51.360 align:start position:0%
names written out for me so i can put it
 
00:29:55.269 --> 00:29:55.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:57.269 --> 00:29:57.279 align:start position:0%
um representative
 
00:29:58.789 --> 00:29:58.799 align:start position:0%
uh thank you uh
 
00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:00.720 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:06.640 align:start position:0%
question uh on page two uh line of 32
 
00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
refers to uh termination of
 
00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
determination of pregnancy does that
 
00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:16.960 align:start position:0%
also in terms of what you would
 
00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
understand as miscarriage
 
00:30:20.549 --> 00:30:20.559 align:start position:0%
uh would that be included in this
 
00:30:20.559 --> 00:30:24.789 align:start position:0%
uh would that be included in this
database

00:30:24.789 --> 00:30:24.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:24.799 --> 00:30:25.990 align:start position:0%
 
that

00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:26.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.190 align:start position:0%
that
um

00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:27.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:29.190 --> 00:30:29.200 align:start position:0%
what i understand is the termination
 
00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:31.360 align:start position:0%
after 24 weeks
 
00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
will be like elective so for this field
 
00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
we are looking for elective termination
 
00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
for the miscarriage um it will have a
 
00:30:41.909 --> 00:30:41.919 align:start position:0%
different type of coding or
 
00:30:45.269 --> 00:30:45.279 align:start position:0%
data analysis that will vote on the cms
 
00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:47.200 align:start position:0%
so if i
 
00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:48.230 align:start position:0%
so if i
continue

00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:48.240 align:start position:0%
continue
 
00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:54.720 align:start position:0%
yes yeah follow up uh thank you uh so
 
00:30:56.710 --> 00:30:56.720 align:start position:0%
another if we added
 
00:30:58.470 --> 00:30:58.480 align:start position:0%
uh voluntary
 
00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:00.320 align:start position:0%
termination of pregnancy that would
 
00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:02.080 align:start position:0%
clarify any
 
00:31:08.149 --> 00:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:09.909 --> 00:31:09.919 align:start position:0%
we are talking about some medical terms
 
00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:11.360 align:start position:0%
so it might be very different from
 
00:31:13.509 --> 00:31:13.519 align:start position:0%
different things this is a data part of
 
00:31:15.350 --> 00:31:15.360 align:start position:0%
it where the data collection or the
 
00:31:16.789 --> 00:31:16.799 align:start position:0%
information comes from us from the
 
00:31:18.789 --> 00:31:18.799 align:start position:0%
hospital so that's how the coding
 
00:31:21.669 --> 00:31:21.679 align:start position:0%
happens we don't make those codes so it
 
00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
can be different so we can expand the
 
00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
course to look at but that's again that
 
00:31:27.029 --> 00:31:27.039 align:start position:0%
comes back to the
 
00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank you i think we'll discuss
 
00:31:36.149 --> 00:31:36.159 align:start position:0%
that when we execute thank you
 
00:31:37.269 --> 00:31:37.279 align:start position:0%
are there other questions from the
 
00:31:37.279 --> 00:31:41.430 align:start position:0%
are there other questions from the
committee

00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:44.149 --> 00:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
i i have one question are you aware of
 
00:31:46.389 --> 00:31:46.399 align:start position:0%
any cases where a
 
00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:48.880 align:start position:0%
where a victim has been
 
00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
raped especially an insane case where
 
00:31:52.149 --> 00:31:52.159 align:start position:0%
they weren't able to receive this
 
00:31:55.110 --> 00:31:55.120 align:start position:0%
service until after six months gestation
 
00:31:56.630 --> 00:31:56.640 align:start position:0%
we we don't have that kind of
 
00:31:58.310 --> 00:31:58.320 align:start position:0%
information as the department doesn't
 
00:32:00.549 --> 00:32:00.559 align:start position:0%
collect that information that would be
 
00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:02.480 align:start position:0%
there in other places but not in the
 
00:32:04.389 --> 00:32:04.399 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and do you know where we
 
00:32:07.509 --> 00:32:07.519 align:start position:0%
might be able to find those
 
00:32:11.509 --> 00:32:11.519 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't know that thank you thank you
 
00:32:13.269 --> 00:32:13.279 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
00:32:16.630 --> 00:32:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:18.389 --> 00:32:18.399 align:start position:0%

and sit before you as a representative
 
00:32:56.549 --> 00:32:56.559 align:start position:0%
of the house majority office we in the
 
00:32:58.549 --> 00:32:58.559 align:start position:0%
house majority office recommend that
 
00:33:00.630 --> 00:33:00.640 align:start position:0%
this bill be found inexpedient to
 
00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:02.230 align:start position:0%
this bill be found inexpedient to
legislate

00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:02.240 align:start position:0%
legislate
 
00:33:05.110 --> 00:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
last year's part of hb2 the house of
 
00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
representatives passed an exceptional
 
00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
fetal protection led
 
00:33:12.149 --> 00:33:12.159 align:start position:0%
exceptional fetal protection legislation
 
00:33:14.070 --> 00:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
and just two weeks ago
 
00:33:16.149 --> 00:33:16.159 align:start position:0%
the house tabled another bill
 
00:33:17.909 --> 00:33:17.919 align:start position:0%
and a possible amendment that would have
 
00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
chipped away
 
00:33:21.669 --> 00:33:21.679 align:start position:0%
at the hb2 legislation that we passed
 
00:33:23.669 --> 00:33:23.679 align:start position:0%
just last year
 
00:33:27.190 --> 00:33:27.200 align:start position:0%
this bill h.b 1609 is a further attempt
 
00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
to roll back and infringe upon last
 
00:33:31.509 --> 00:33:31.519 align:start position:0%
year's legislation
 
00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
therefore house majority office strongly
 
00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
recommends hpe 1609 be found in
 
00:33:39.190 --> 00:33:39.200 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate

stripping out the uh the ultrasound
 
00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:37.200 align:start position:0%
requirements would be uh the equivalent
 
00:34:39.430 --> 00:34:39.440 align:start position:0%
of asking a police officer to stand on
 
00:34:41.669 --> 00:34:41.679 align:start position:0%
the side of the road pulling people over
 
00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:44.240 align:start position:0%
uh writing them a speeding citation and
 
00:34:45.669 --> 00:34:45.679 align:start position:0%
going to court and looking at the judge
 
00:34:48.470 --> 00:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
and say i think they were doing 70.

you know uh

it it wouldn't stand uh and neither

would uh neither would
 
00:34:55.669 --> 00:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
a question on the on the gestation of a
 
00:34:58.790 --> 00:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
baby um you know we're talking uh
 
00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:00.069 align:start position:0%
baby um you know we're talking uh
pain-capable

00:35:00.069 --> 00:35:00.079 align:start position:0%
pain-capable
 
00:35:03.430 --> 00:35:03.440 align:start position:0%
pain capable babies uh i've got a

00:35:15.589 --> 00:35:15.599 align:start position:0%
it says uh that i've had the privilege
 
00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:16.960 align:start position:0%
of being able to operate on little
 
00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
babies that were 25 26 27 28 weeks
 
00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:21.670 align:start position:0%
babies that were 25 26 27 28 weeks
gestation

00:35:21.670 --> 00:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
gestation
 
00:35:24.390 --> 00:35:24.400 align:start position:0%
said the world famous neurosurgeon i can
 
00:35:25.750 --> 00:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
guarantee you
 
00:35:27.430 --> 00:35:27.440 align:start position:0%
they can feel pain
 
00:35:30.390 --> 00:35:30.400 align:start position:0%
they can react
 
00:35:32.310 --> 00:35:32.320 align:start position:0%
you have to give them the anesthesia if
 
00:35:33.829 --> 00:35:33.839 align:start position:0%
you're going to cut them believe me said
 
00:35:35.589 --> 00:35:35.599 align:start position:0%
carson who added
 
00:35:37.109 --> 00:35:37.119 align:start position:0%
they can also respond to comfort and
 
00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
warmth to somebody to say that that that
 
00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
it's a meaningless bunch of cells
 
00:35:44.069 --> 00:35:44.079 align:start position:0%
honestly said carson is totally is just
 
00:35:45.829 --> 00:35:45.839 align:start position:0%
totally ignorant
 
00:35:48.310 --> 00:35:48.320 align:start position:0%
carson said the act of aborting a child
 
00:35:49.829 --> 00:35:49.839 align:start position:0%
is barbaric
 
00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
and i tend to agree and especially in
 
00:35:54.069 --> 00:35:54.079 align:start position:0%
this case uh
 
00:35:55.750 --> 00:35:55.760 align:start position:0%
that and that for late term abortions
 
00:35:57.349 --> 00:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
where the baby could live outside the
 
00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:00.160 align:start position:0%
womb he used the term murder
 
00:36:01.990 --> 00:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
the level of barbarianism that late term
 
00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:04.240 align:start position:0%
abortion requires i quite frankly don't
 
00:36:09.430 --> 00:36:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:11.430 --> 00:36:11.440 align:start position:0%
once again you know this this is a a
 
00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
world-renowned pediatrics uh
 
00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
neurosurgeon that has operated and uh
 
00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
you know i emailed the the committee a a
 
00:36:21.349 --> 00:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
clip from the movie unplanned
 
00:36:24.310 --> 00:36:24.320 align:start position:0%
and uh i did that this morning i emailed
 
00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
a few others uh the other day but uh
 
00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:28.640 align:start position:0%
it's it's only two or three minutes and
 
00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
i i ask you to watch it you know uh you
 
00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
know the the the doctor and the
 
00:36:34.630 --> 00:36:34.640 align:start position:0%
assistant the assistant are certainly
 
00:36:36.790 --> 00:36:36.800 align:start position:0%
paid actors but the baby in that
 
00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:38.560 align:start position:0%
ultrasound is not
 
00:36:40.790 --> 00:36:40.800 align:start position:0%
you know that that baby kicks it kicks
 
00:36:42.310 --> 00:36:42.320 align:start position:0%
at the instrument that's that's going to
 
00:36:45.589 --> 00:36:45.599 align:start position:0%
be you know tearing it from from limb uh
 
00:36:47.349 --> 00:36:47.359 align:start position:0%
once again it just uh it shows the
 
00:36:47.359 --> 00:36:48.870 align:start position:0%
once again it just uh it shows the
barbarianism

00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:48.880 align:start position:0%
barbarianism
 
00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:50.640 align:start position:0%
of abortion
 
00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:52.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:36:54.310 --> 00:36:54.320 align:start position:0%
thank you representative any questions
 
00:36:55.990 --> 00:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
00:36:58.069 --> 00:36:58.079 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you thank you
 
00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
next we'll call from far away
 
00:37:02.310 --> 00:37:02.320 align:start position:0%
representative kanark
 
00:37:16.390 --> 00:37:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:18.640 align:start position:0%
thank you very much madam chair
 
00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:20.640 align:start position:0%
for the record i'm representative jerry
 
00:37:22.390 --> 00:37:22.400 align:start position:0%
canuck and i'm representing
 
00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
carroll county district 3 and for those
 
00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:26.640 align:start position:0%
who don't already know i'm a retired
 
00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
surgeon as well
 
00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
so i'm here to testify in support of hb
 
00:37:33.670 --> 00:37:33.680 align:start position:0%
1609 which removes some of the most
 
00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
troublesome portions of the fetal life
 
00:37:37.829 --> 00:37:37.839 align:start position:0%
protection act an act that legislates
 
00:37:39.990 --> 00:37:40.000 align:start position:0%
the practice of medicine which we don't
 
00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:40.950 align:start position:0%
the practice of medicine which we don't
do

00:37:40.950 --> 00:37:40.960 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
compromises patient-centered
 
00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
evidence-based care and criminalizes a
 
00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
standard of medical practice
 
00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:50.800 align:start position:0%
abortions after 24 weeks gestational age
 
00:37:52.950 --> 00:37:52.960 align:start position:0%
are really very rare
 
00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:54.160 align:start position:0%
and they're usually done in major
 
00:37:56.470 --> 00:37:56.480 align:start position:0%
medical centers nearly exclusively
 
00:37:58.550 --> 00:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
because of the discovery of a severe
 
00:38:01.270 --> 00:38:01.280 align:start position:0%
fetal anomaly which is incompatible with
 
00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:02.630 align:start position:0%
fetal anomaly which is incompatible with
survival

00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:02.640 align:start position:0%
survival
 
00:38:05.109 --> 00:38:05.119 align:start position:0%
or when the pregnancy presents a severe
 
00:38:07.510 --> 00:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
risk to the mother's health
 
00:38:09.589 --> 00:38:09.599 align:start position:0%
now importantly what 1609 does is it
 
00:38:11.349 --> 00:38:11.359 align:start position:0%
adds an exception for severe fetal
 
00:38:13.829 --> 00:38:13.839 align:start position:0%
anomalies which wasn't in the original
 
00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
these are anomalies that are not
 
00:38:16.870 --> 00:38:16.880 align:start position:0%
compatible with life
 
00:38:19.270 --> 00:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
and there those are also rare but there
 
00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:20.960 align:start position:0%
are a number of different anomalies for
 
00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
example anencephaly when a child is
 
00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:24.720 align:start position:0%
going to be born without any portion of
 
00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:26.640 align:start position:0%
the head or brain and there are other
 
00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:28.640 align:start position:0%
ones many of them are neurologic where
 
00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
there is simply no brain whatsoever just
 
00:38:32.390 --> 00:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
a bag of fluid
 
00:38:33.829 --> 00:38:33.839 align:start position:0%
these are
 
00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
these are infants which will not survive
 
00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
after birth or if they do it's for a few
 
00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:45.760 align:start position:0%
this uh the issue is that
 
00:38:47.990 --> 00:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
you kind of wonder why 24 weeks
 
00:38:50.069 --> 00:38:50.079 align:start position:0%
well it's important to realize that
 
00:38:51.589 --> 00:38:51.599 align:start position:0%
although we may know there's an anomaly
 
00:38:53.109 --> 00:38:53.119 align:start position:0%
early sometimes the severity can't be
 
00:38:55.109 --> 00:38:55.119 align:start position:0%
determined until after 24 weeks as you
 
00:38:57.270 --> 00:38:57.280 align:start position:0%
look at it with further ultrasound and
 
00:38:59.589 --> 00:38:59.599 align:start position:0%
given our large population of uninsured
 
00:39:03.910 --> 00:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
and uninsured underinsured uh people uh
 
00:39:04.950 --> 00:39:04.960 align:start position:0%
it's important to realize that some
 
00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:06.880 align:start position:0%
women may not even obtain prenatal natal
 
00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
care before 24 weeks
 
00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
and in a case of rape or incest
 
00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:12.560 align:start position:0%
the comment was made a moment ago she's
 
00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
got 24 weeks but some may be too
 
00:39:16.710 --> 00:39:16.720 align:start position:0%
traumatized to even go seek care
 
00:39:17.990 --> 00:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
and the other is sometimes a woman
 
00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:19.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't know she's pregnant i know you
 
00:39:21.270 --> 00:39:21.280 align:start position:0%
may find that a little weird i was not
 
00:39:23.829 --> 00:39:23.839 align:start position:0%
no byn i was a spine surgeon but i had
 
00:39:25.270 --> 00:39:25.280 align:start position:0%
this happen once
 
00:39:27.430 --> 00:39:27.440 align:start position:0%
i had a woman about 17 come walking in
 
00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
to be seen for back pain
 
00:39:31.829 --> 00:39:31.839 align:start position:0%
i had a medical resident shadowing me
 
00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
that day after we took the history and
 
00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:35.680 align:start position:0%
we walked out i looked at her because
 
00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
she was changing her clothes i said does
 
00:39:39.270 --> 00:39:39.280 align:start position:0%
she look pregnant to you
 
00:39:41.349 --> 00:39:41.359 align:start position:0%
she said kind of does
 
00:39:43.190 --> 00:39:43.200 align:start position:0%
so i hadn't done an examination of the
 
00:39:45.190 --> 00:39:45.200 align:start position:0%
abdomen for the size of the uterus for
 
00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:46.720 align:start position:0%
quite some years but i could remember
 
00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
how to do it and found her uterus and it
 
00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:51.200 align:start position:0%
turns out she was about seven months
 
00:39:53.589 --> 00:39:53.599 align:start position:0%
pregnant she had received zero prenatal
 
00:39:55.510 --> 00:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
care she was clueless that she was
 
00:39:57.910 --> 00:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
pregnant so it can happen
 
00:39:59.109 --> 00:39:59.119 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is it's really
 
00:40:00.950 --> 00:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
devastating for a mother and a father to
 
00:40:02.710 --> 00:40:02.720 align:start position:0%
be confronted with a severe fetal
 
00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:04.069 align:start position:0%
be confronted with a severe fetal
anomaly

00:40:04.069 --> 00:40:04.079 align:start position:0%
anomaly
 
00:40:06.710 --> 00:40:06.720 align:start position:0%
the accepted medical choices available
 
00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
to patients
 
00:40:09.589 --> 00:40:09.599 align:start position:0%
to parents i should say
 
00:40:11.349 --> 00:40:11.359 align:start position:0%
are either termination of the pregnancy
 
00:40:13.270 --> 00:40:13.280 align:start position:0%
or to carry the pregnancy to term and
 
00:40:16.470 --> 00:40:16.480 align:start position:0%
provide comfort care until the baby dies
 
00:40:18.150 --> 00:40:18.160 align:start position:0%
this difficult decision should be made
 
00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
by the parents
 
00:40:20.790 --> 00:40:20.800 align:start position:0%
and the provider
 
00:40:22.390 --> 00:40:22.400 align:start position:0%
not legislators
 
00:40:24.069 --> 00:40:24.079 align:start position:0%
the fetal life protection act by
 
00:40:26.069 --> 00:40:26.079 align:start position:0%
prohibiting the choice of termination
 
00:40:27.829 --> 00:40:27.839 align:start position:0%
forces the mother to carry the baby to
 
00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:30.400 align:start position:0%
term and go through labor and delivery
 
00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:33.440 align:start position:0%
only to watch the infant die
 
00:40:35.349 --> 00:40:35.359 align:start position:0%
i do have one concern about this bill
 
00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
though it though it improves the current
 
00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
law it does fail to remove the sections
 
00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
which expose the provider to civil and
 
00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
criminal liability sections 329-46
 
00:40:47.990 --> 00:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
and 3-2 sorry 3-9-2 colon 46 and
 
00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:49.670 align:start position:0%
and 3-2 sorry 3-9-2 colon 46 and
3-9-2-47

00:40:49.670 --> 00:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
3-9-2-47
 
00:40:52.630 --> 00:40:52.640 align:start position:0%
should be repealed as well even with the
 
00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
exceptions allowing termination of
 
00:40:56.069 --> 00:40:56.079 align:start position:0%
pregnancy for severe fetal anomaly which
 
00:40:57.270 --> 00:40:57.280 align:start position:0%
is added
 
00:40:59.190 --> 00:40:59.200 align:start position:0%
or in the case of life of the health of
 
00:41:01.589 --> 00:41:01.599 align:start position:0%
the pregnant woman the exposure of a
 
00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:03.280 align:start position:0%
physician to criminal and civil
 
00:41:04.870 --> 00:41:04.880 align:start position:0%
liability with up to a hundred thousand
 
00:41:07.109 --> 00:41:07.119 align:start position:0%
dollar fine in years of prison
 
00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:09.200 align:start position:0%
is very troubling
 
00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
we're we're used to civil liability
 
00:41:12.710 --> 00:41:12.720 align:start position:0%
because we've got malpractice
 
00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:14.720 align:start position:0%
cases we have to face
 
00:41:17.109 --> 00:41:17.119 align:start position:0%
but the criminalization
 
00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
of the wrong decision
 
00:41:20.950 --> 00:41:20.960 align:start position:0%
wrong in quotes
 
00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
places an extra burden on the physician
 
00:41:24.870 --> 00:41:24.880 align:start position:0%
because the decisions that we face as
 
00:41:27.349 --> 00:41:27.359 align:start position:0%
physicians are often complicated
 
00:41:29.829 --> 00:41:29.839 align:start position:0%
with serious consequences and a lot of
 
00:41:31.829 --> 00:41:31.839 align:start position:0%
gray areas there's been massive
 
00:41:33.829 --> 00:41:33.839 align:start position:0%
documentation that on any number of
 
00:41:35.990 --> 00:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
relatively common disorders when you
 
00:41:37.829 --> 00:41:37.839 align:start position:0%
when the story is presented to a panel
 
00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:40.160 align:start position:0%
of physicians that they'll disagree on
 
00:41:41.829 --> 00:41:41.839 align:start position:0%
what the decision would make it would be
 
00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
and it's justifiable so different
 
00:41:46.069 --> 00:41:46.079 align:start position:0%
providers can make justifiably different
 
00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
decisions even replaced with the same
 
00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:49.829 align:start position:0%
decisions even replaced with the same
problem

00:41:49.829 --> 00:41:49.839 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:41:52.150 --> 00:41:52.160 align:start position:0%
so place yourself in the shoes of a
 
00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
physician who must make a decision when
 
00:41:55.990 --> 00:41:56.000 align:start position:0%
faced with a seriously ill pregnant
 
00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:56.870 align:start position:0%
faced with a seriously ill pregnant
woman

00:41:56.870 --> 00:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
woman
 
00:42:00.390 --> 00:42:00.400 align:start position:0%
perhaps blood pressure 220 over 180 and
 
00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
they've got to do something about it or
 
00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:03.760 align:start position:0%
a fatal fetal anomaly no longer can they
 
00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:06.160 align:start position:0%
make the best decision for the mother
 
00:42:07.750 --> 00:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
they got to watch over their shoulder
 
00:42:09.589 --> 00:42:09.599 align:start position:0%
and wonder whether some court will later
 
00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:12.640 align:start position:0%
decide that that fetal anomaly
 
00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:13.430 align:start position:0%
decide that that fetal anomaly
or

00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:42:15.990 --> 00:42:16.000 align:start position:0%
that seriously ill pregnant woman wasn't
 
00:42:18.790 --> 00:42:18.800 align:start position:0%
quite severe enough to justify
 
00:42:21.270 --> 00:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
the termination
 
00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
that's what happens in male practice
 
00:42:24.950 --> 00:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
we're only facing civil penalties
 
00:42:26.309 --> 00:42:26.319 align:start position:0%
they need to wonder whether this court
 
00:42:28.390 --> 00:42:28.400 align:start position:0%
will later decide that it wasn't serious
 
00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:30.480 align:start position:0%
enough and sends them off instead to
 
00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:31.750 align:start position:0%
enough and sends them off instead to
prison

00:42:31.750 --> 00:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
prison
 
00:42:33.349 --> 00:42:33.359 align:start position:0%
this is really going to make it hard for
 
00:42:35.109 --> 00:42:35.119 align:start position:0%
us to be able to recruit
 
00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
ob gyn practitioners to this state and
 
00:42:39.589 --> 00:42:39.599 align:start position:0%
particularly anybody who wishes to work
 
00:42:41.589 --> 00:42:41.599 align:start position:0%
in high-risk obstetrics
 
00:42:42.950 --> 00:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
thank you i'll take questions if they're
 
00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:45.349 align:start position:0%
thank you i'll take questions if they're
already

00:42:45.349 --> 00:42:45.359 align:start position:0%
already
 
00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:52.230 align:start position:0%
 
microphone

00:42:52.230 --> 00:42:52.240 align:start position:0%
microphone
 
00:42:55.270 --> 00:42:55.280 align:start position:0%
your microphone please yes
 
00:42:56.630 --> 00:42:56.640 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman thank you
 
00:42:57.990 --> 00:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
representative take my question it's a
 
00:42:59.270 --> 00:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
very quick question
 
00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:00.230 align:start position:0%
very quick question
um

00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:03.430 --> 00:43:03.440 align:start position:0%
i'm not clear from your testimony do you
 
00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
intend to submit an amendment to this
 
00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:08.230 align:start position:0%
intend to submit an amendment to this
bill

00:43:08.230 --> 00:43:08.240 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:43:10.069 --> 00:43:10.079 align:start position:0%
i would think it would be a reasonable
 
00:43:12.309 --> 00:43:12.319 align:start position:0%
thing to do um
 
00:43:14.069 --> 00:43:14.079 align:start position:0%
because again i think it should be it
 
00:43:15.829 --> 00:43:15.839 align:start position:0%
would be wise to remove at least the
 
00:43:18.069 --> 00:43:18.079 align:start position:0%
criminal penalty if not the civil
 
00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:20.240 align:start position:0%
penalty as well so that i think should
 
00:43:22.630 --> 00:43:22.640 align:start position:0%
be considered as weak as we consider the
 
00:43:25.349 --> 00:43:25.359 align:start position:0%
bill thank you thank you very much
 
00:43:28.069 --> 00:43:28.079 align:start position:0%
other questions from the committee
 
00:43:30.150 --> 00:43:30.160 align:start position:0%
i have one uh thank you very much for
 
00:43:32.309 --> 00:43:32.319 align:start position:0%
taking the question is there anything in
 
00:43:34.630 --> 00:43:34.640 align:start position:0%
the law that prohibits a doctor with a
 
00:43:36.470 --> 00:43:36.480 align:start position:0%
patient with preeclampsia as you
 
00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned or any other of these
 
00:43:40.230 --> 00:43:40.240 align:start position:0%
challenges from simply delivering the
 
00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
baby early either through induction or
 
00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
through a cesarean
 
00:43:45.670 --> 00:43:45.680 align:start position:0%
actually no that that's an option and i
 
00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
have a very good friend who had a
 
00:43:50.069 --> 00:43:50.079 align:start position:0%
28-week gestational age baby who had
 
00:43:52.710 --> 00:43:52.720 align:start position:0%
preeclampsia and did have her delivery
 
00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
and i know this child quite well and
 
00:43:56.390 --> 00:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
she's had a lot of problems but she's
 
00:43:58.550 --> 00:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
been doing fine so that's fine but that
 
00:44:02.069 --> 00:44:02.079 align:start position:0%
that is a so that can be an option
 
00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
um sometimes and i think you know again
 
00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
in the heat of the battle
 
00:44:08.710 --> 00:44:08.720 align:start position:0%
you may not be able to to move on to
 
00:44:11.109 --> 00:44:11.119 align:start position:0%
that one well and so i think again the
 
00:44:13.270 --> 00:44:13.280 align:start position:0%
question is should legislators with no
 
00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:14.470 align:start position:0%
question is should legislators with no
training

00:44:14.470 --> 00:44:14.480 align:start position:0%
training
 
00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:15.430 align:start position:0%
training
distant

00:44:15.430 --> 00:44:15.440 align:start position:0%
distant
 
00:44:18.069 --> 00:44:18.079 align:start position:0%
at some point in time make a decision
 
00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
that influences the decision made by
 
00:44:23.589 --> 00:44:23.599 align:start position:0%
the surgeon the ob gyn
 
00:44:24.870 --> 00:44:24.880 align:start position:0%
at that moment
 
00:44:26.710 --> 00:44:26.720 align:start position:0%
anybody who's been in
 
00:44:28.309 --> 00:44:28.319 align:start position:0%
faced with the patient who is looking
 
00:44:29.510 --> 00:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
like they're going to die right in front
 
00:44:31.349 --> 00:44:31.359 align:start position:0%
of you doesn't want to take a lot of
 
00:44:32.470 --> 00:44:32.480 align:start position:0%
time thinking about whether they could
 
00:44:34.309 --> 00:44:34.319 align:start position:0%
go to jail for making what's going to be
 
00:44:36.630 --> 00:44:36.640 align:start position:0%
an appropriate decision
 
00:44:38.710 --> 00:44:38.720 align:start position:0%
so yes they could do that but that's the
 
00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:39.510 align:start position:0%
so yes they could do that but that's the
thing

00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:44:41.829 --> 00:44:41.839 align:start position:0%
it's a choice
 
00:44:43.430 --> 00:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
not a mandate
 
00:44:45.109 --> 00:44:45.119 align:start position:0%
and just as a follow-up is there any
 
00:44:46.309 --> 00:44:46.319 align:start position:0%
time when the mother's health is
 
00:44:47.750 --> 00:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
protected by
 
00:44:49.589 --> 00:44:49.599 align:start position:0%
terminating that child before that early
 
00:44:51.190 --> 00:44:51.200 align:start position:0%
delivery or would that waste those
 
00:44:53.670 --> 00:44:53.680 align:start position:0%
precious seconds
 
00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:54.390 align:start position:0%
precious seconds
i

00:44:54.390 --> 00:44:54.400 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:44:56.790 --> 00:44:56.800 align:start position:0%
i might defer to the any ob gyns that
 
00:44:59.030 --> 00:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
might be coming up i don't know for sure
 
00:45:00.790 --> 00:45:00.800 align:start position:0%
but i would presume that that could be
 
00:45:02.390 --> 00:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
because it probably takes a little
 
00:45:04.710 --> 00:45:04.720 align:start position:0%
longer to organize for an actual
 
00:45:06.069 --> 00:45:06.079 align:start position:0%
delivery which would usually have to be
 
00:45:08.150 --> 00:45:08.160 align:start position:0%
a cesarean um actually they're both
 
00:45:09.670 --> 00:45:09.680 align:start position:0%
operations so i don't know for sure i
 
00:45:11.349 --> 00:45:11.359 align:start position:0%
will have i better not go any further
 
00:45:12.870 --> 00:45:12.880 align:start position:0%
because i know not to speak when i don't
 
00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:13.910 align:start position:0%
because i know not to speak when i don't
know

00:45:13.910 --> 00:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:17.200 align:start position:0%
thank you very much any other questions
 
00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:18.640 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
00:45:20.950 --> 00:45:20.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:45:22.710 --> 00:45:22.720 align:start position:0%
next we will call representative kurt
 
00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:27.510 align:start position:0%
next we will call representative kurt
welper

00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:30.630 --> 00:45:30.640 align:start position:0%
and as we have a very long list
 
00:45:32.950 --> 00:45:32.960 align:start position:0%
we will start going to the time limits
 
00:45:34.309 --> 00:45:34.319 align:start position:0%
as well we've been doing a pretty good
 
00:45:35.349 --> 00:45:35.359 align:start position:0%
job with that and i'll just start
 
00:45:41.430 --> 00:45:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:42.790 --> 00:45:42.800 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair members of

we
 
00:46:07.670 --> 00:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
were involved in the development of the
 
00:46:09.430 --> 00:46:09.440 align:start position:0%
fetal life protection act and i just
 
00:46:11.190 --> 00:46:11.200 align:start position:0%
want to very briefly you have written
 
00:46:13.109 --> 00:46:13.119 align:start position:0%
testimony already so i'm just briefly
 
00:46:14.790 --> 00:46:14.800 align:start position:0%
going to cover a couple quick points
 
00:46:16.470 --> 00:46:16.480 align:start position:0%
then we don't need any changes to the
 
00:46:18.870 --> 00:46:18.880 align:start position:0%
flpa the family uh
 
00:46:21.349 --> 00:46:21.359 align:start position:0%
vietnam protection act it was carefully
 
00:46:23.910 --> 00:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
constructed to avoid the challenges that
 
00:46:25.750 --> 00:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
we hear about today the undue burden
 
00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:26.790 align:start position:0%
we hear about today the undue burden
statute

00:46:26.790 --> 00:46:26.800 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:28.720 align:start position:0%
one is just one there are several other
 
00:46:31.030 --> 00:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
constitutional issues that could have
 
00:46:31.990 --> 00:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
come up
 
00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
over this bill but it was conduct it was
 
00:46:37.670 --> 00:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
constructed specifically to avoid all of
 
00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:39.030 align:start position:0%
constructed specifically to avoid all of
those

00:46:39.030 --> 00:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:41.440 align:start position:0%
so there's that
 
00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
here i want to talk as you just asked
 
00:46:45.109 --> 00:46:45.119 align:start position:0%
about about the delivery and the
 
00:46:46.870 --> 00:46:46.880 align:start position:0%
abortion business right
 
00:46:48.950 --> 00:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
delivery is faster
 
00:46:50.630 --> 00:46:50.640 align:start position:0%
you can get delivery done in i don't
 
00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
know 12 hours or 20 hours an abortion at
 
00:46:57.030 --> 00:46:57.040 align:start position:0%
this stage of pregnancy takes days
 
00:46:59.990 --> 00:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
so it's faster and safer
 
00:47:02.390 --> 00:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
for the woman to have an early delivery
 
00:47:05.430 --> 00:47:05.440 align:start position:0%
and of course way safer for the baby
 
00:47:08.790 --> 00:47:08.800 align:start position:0%
but that delivery has other benefits
 
00:47:10.710 --> 00:47:10.720 align:start position:0%
that abortion
 
00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:11.990 align:start position:0%
that abortion
negates

00:47:11.990 --> 00:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
negates
 
00:47:15.109 --> 00:47:15.119 align:start position:0%
and that is the child actually gets born
 
00:47:16.470 --> 00:47:16.480 align:start position:0%
the mother
 
00:47:17.910 --> 00:47:17.920 align:start position:0%
the parents
 
00:47:20.470 --> 00:47:20.480 align:start position:0%
can relate to the child they can love
 
00:47:23.030 --> 00:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
that child no matter how short its life
 
00:47:25.349 --> 00:47:25.359 align:start position:0%
might be and there's testimony of
 
00:47:27.109 --> 00:47:27.119 align:start position:0%
thousands of mothers
 
00:47:29.190 --> 00:47:29.200 align:start position:0%
about the few minutes that they have
 
00:47:30.390 --> 00:47:30.400 align:start position:0%
with their
 
00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:31.670 align:start position:0%
with their
child

00:47:31.670 --> 00:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
child
 
00:47:34.230 --> 00:47:34.240 align:start position:0%
as it expires
 
00:47:38.069 --> 00:47:38.079 align:start position:0%
and the value that that provides
 
00:47:39.750 --> 00:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
everybody's uh
 
00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:41.030 align:start position:0%
everybody's uh
sympathetic

00:47:41.030 --> 00:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
sympathetic
 
00:47:44.230 --> 00:47:44.240 align:start position:0%
empathetic with rape and incest victims
 
00:47:46.870 --> 00:47:46.880 align:start position:0%
but six months is a long time
 
00:47:49.030 --> 00:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
and at some point
 
00:47:51.990 --> 00:47:52.000 align:start position:0%
we have to say you've had enough time
 
00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.390 align:start position:0%
we have to say you've had enough time
and

00:47:54.390 --> 00:47:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:57.190 --> 00:47:57.200 align:start position:0%
it's time we we need to protect that
 
00:47:59.670 --> 00:47:59.680 align:start position:0%
that human being that was recognized way
 
00:48:01.910 --> 00:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
back in roe versus wade
 
00:48:03.910 --> 00:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
right so there's that
 
00:48:06.150 --> 00:48:06.160 align:start position:0%
and the fetal anomaly issue is similar
 
00:48:07.109 --> 00:48:07.119 align:start position:0%
right it's
 
00:48:09.030 --> 00:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
we should just choose life
 
00:48:11.349 --> 00:48:11.359 align:start position:0%
it's just so much easier one more thing
 
00:48:12.870 --> 00:48:12.880 align:start position:0%
rape victims
 
00:48:15.190 --> 00:48:15.200 align:start position:0%
actual studies of rape victims
 
00:48:16.549 --> 00:48:16.559 align:start position:0%
the mothers
 
00:48:20.309 --> 00:48:20.319 align:start position:0%
testify that the baby helps them heal
 
00:48:23.750 --> 00:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
gives them a reason to continue living
 
00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:24.390 align:start position:0%
gives them a reason to continue living
and

00:48:24.390 --> 00:48:24.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:48:26.710 --> 00:48:26.720 align:start position:0%
look to the future
 
00:48:28.790 --> 00:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
and abortees
 
00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
represent the abortion as a second grade
 
00:48:33.750 --> 00:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
with that you have my written testimony
 
00:48:35.430 --> 00:48:35.440 align:start position:0%
and in introduced time i won't take any
 
00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:36.790 align:start position:0%
and in introduced time i won't take any
questions

00:48:36.790 --> 00:48:36.800 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:48:42.549 --> 00:48:42.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:50.950 --> 00:48:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:52.150 --> 00:48:52.160 align:start position:0%
oh he's in the chairs meeting i
 
00:48:53.750 --> 00:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
apologize that's why it was stacked that
 
00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:54.549 align:start position:0%
apologize that's why it was stacked that
way

00:48:54.549 --> 00:48:54.559 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:48:56.549 --> 00:48:56.559 align:start position:0%
um thank you then um
 
00:48:58.870 --> 00:48:58.880 align:start position:0%
next we have lori stafford from health
 
00:49:00.950 --> 00:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
and human cert oh sorry we have laurie
 
00:49:02.230 --> 00:49:02.240 align:start position:0%

good morning um thank you for listening
 
00:49:11.750 --> 00:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
to my testimony
 
00:49:13.270 --> 00:49:13.280 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:49:15.910 --> 00:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
the fetal life protection act is a
 
00:49:18.630 --> 00:49:18.640 align:start position:0%
moderate common sense law that should
 
00:49:20.470 --> 00:49:20.480 align:start position:0%
stand as as is
 
00:49:22.950 --> 00:49:22.960 align:start position:0%
most granite staters like me believe in
 
00:49:24.630 --> 00:49:24.640 align:start position:0%
these protections
 
00:49:27.670 --> 00:49:27.680 align:start position:0%
for third trimester babies
 
00:49:31.109 --> 00:49:31.119 align:start position:0%
i'm also a widow and a mom of two adult
 
00:49:34.069 --> 00:49:34.079 align:start position:0%
sons with duchenne muscular dystrophy
 
00:49:36.390 --> 00:49:36.400 align:start position:0%
although they couldn't be here today
 
00:49:38.309 --> 00:49:38.319 align:start position:0%
you may remember them testifying in the
 
00:49:45.430 --> 00:49:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:46.790 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:49:46.790 --> 00:49:46.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:49.109 --> 00:49:49.119 align:start position:0%
ben and sam asked me to share with you
 
00:49:49.119 --> 00:49:50.470 align:start position:0%
ben and sam asked me to share with you
today

00:49:50.470 --> 00:49:50.480 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:49:51.510 --> 00:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
that although they have a
 
00:49:53.829 --> 00:49:53.839 align:start position:0%
life-threatening condition due to a
 
00:49:55.829 --> 00:49:55.839 align:start position:0%
genetic defect at birth
 
00:49:59.030 --> 00:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
that they have lived full productive
 
00:50:00.630 --> 00:50:00.640 align:start position:0%
rich lives
 
00:50:02.710 --> 00:50:02.720 align:start position:0%
not that it has been easy
 
00:50:05.270 --> 00:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
i lost my husband their father over 10
 
00:50:07.750 --> 00:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
years ago but ben has a social work
 
00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:08.950 align:start position:0%
years ago but ben has a social work
degree

00:50:08.950 --> 00:50:08.960 align:start position:0%
degree
 
00:50:11.349 --> 00:50:11.359 align:start position:0%
he works for a nonprofit helping others
 
00:50:12.950 --> 00:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
with disabilities
 
00:50:14.710 --> 00:50:14.720 align:start position:0%
sam is a musician
 
00:50:17.030 --> 00:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
and a motivational speaker
 
00:50:19.349 --> 00:50:19.359 align:start position:0%
so i'm here to ask you today
 
00:50:22.710 --> 00:50:22.720 align:start position:0%
not to deny this same chance for life
 
00:50:24.470 --> 00:50:24.480 align:start position:0%
to others who may
 
00:50:27.030 --> 00:50:27.040 align:start position:0%
have a fetal anonymous
 
00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:28.630 align:start position:0%
have a fetal anonymous
anomaly

00:50:28.630 --> 00:50:28.640 align:start position:0%
anomaly
 
00:50:31.349 --> 00:50:31.359 align:start position:0%
um and i also wanted to
 
00:50:34.069 --> 00:50:34.079 align:start position:0%
tell you really quickly about my friend
 
00:50:35.750 --> 00:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
who i met when she was seven months
 
00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:36.870 align:start position:0%
who i met when she was seven months
pregnant

00:50:36.870 --> 00:50:36.880 align:start position:0%
pregnant
 
00:50:39.190 --> 00:50:39.200 align:start position:0%
and her doctor told her that her baby
 
00:50:41.430 --> 00:50:41.440 align:start position:0%
would not survive birth her name is
 
00:50:43.510 --> 00:50:43.520 align:start position:0%
rosalie stafford she was from salem new
 
00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:44.630 align:start position:0%
rosalie stafford she was from salem new
hampshire

00:50:44.630 --> 00:50:44.640 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:50:47.190 --> 00:50:47.200 align:start position:0%
and and we prayed and
 
00:50:49.750 --> 00:50:49.760 align:start position:0%
she decided not to have an abortion
 
00:50:53.510 --> 00:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
and that child is now 21 years old
 
00:50:55.510 --> 00:50:55.520 align:start position:0%
so the doctors can be wrong when they
 
00:50:57.990 --> 00:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
say that a child is incompatible with
 
00:50:58.000 --> 00:50:58.870 align:start position:0%
say that a child is incompatible with
life

00:50:58.870 --> 00:50:58.880 align:start position:0%
life
 
00:51:01.750 --> 00:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
and so i think we should always err on
 
00:51:04.549 --> 00:51:04.559 align:start position:0%
the on the side of life
 
00:51:07.270 --> 00:51:07.280 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take any questions
 
00:51:08.950 --> 00:51:08.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
00:51:11.190 --> 00:51:11.200 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
 
00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:24.150 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
representative

00:51:24.150 --> 00:51:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:25.349 --> 00:51:25.359 align:start position:0%
would you believe that my
 
00:51:28.069 --> 00:51:28.079 align:start position:0%
daughter-in-law had the same problems
 
00:51:30.950 --> 00:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
she had anomalies with two of her babies
 
00:51:34.390 --> 00:51:34.400 align:start position:0%
in separate pregnancies both times the
 
00:51:37.190 --> 00:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
doctors were adamant
 
00:51:39.670 --> 00:51:39.680 align:start position:0%
about saving her life and that the
 
00:51:41.670 --> 00:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
babies would not survive one had a
 
00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:43.750 align:start position:0%
babies would not survive one had a
kidney

00:51:43.750 --> 00:51:43.760 align:start position:0%
kidney
 
00:51:45.430 --> 00:51:45.440 align:start position:0%
malady and the other
 
00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:46.230 align:start position:0%
malady and the other
had

00:51:46.230 --> 00:51:46.240 align:start position:0%
had
 
00:51:48.829 --> 00:51:48.839 align:start position:0%
fluid up the spine and right into the
 
00:51:50.950 --> 00:51:50.960 align:start position:0%
encephalitis yes
 
00:51:53.910 --> 00:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
cranial cavity and it and it was severe
 
00:51:55.990 --> 00:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
and there oh he's not going to live
 
00:51:57.589 --> 00:51:57.599 align:start position:0%
they're not going to have productive
 
00:51:59.190 --> 00:51:59.200 align:start position:0%
lives they're going to this child is
 
00:52:02.470 --> 00:52:02.480 align:start position:0%
going to die at birth if not before and
 
00:52:05.829 --> 00:52:05.839 align:start position:0%
she chose life and both of those boys
 
00:52:05.839 --> 00:52:07.109 align:start position:0%
she chose life and both of those boys
are

00:52:07.109 --> 00:52:07.119 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:52:07.119 --> 00:52:08.790 align:start position:0%
are
brilliant

00:52:08.790 --> 00:52:08.800 align:start position:0%

problem with them at all even though the
doctors

doctors
 
00:52:20.390 --> 00:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
two times suggested suggested um

thank you chairwoman and committee
members

00:52:54.069 --> 00:52:54.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:54.079 --> 00:52:55.829 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:52:55.829 --> 00:52:55.839 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:52:57.430 --> 00:52:57.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for giving me the opportunity
 
00:52:59.589 --> 00:52:59.599 align:start position:0%
to testify today
 
00:53:01.670 --> 00:53:01.680 align:start position:0%
i come before you today as a registered

00:53:05.990 --> 00:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
hb1609
 
00:53:08.390 --> 00:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
in preparation for today's meeting
 
00:53:10.390 --> 00:53:10.400 align:start position:0%
and testimony
 
00:53:12.630 --> 00:53:12.640 align:start position:0%
i did some research and i learned a few
 
00:53:15.589 --> 00:53:15.599 align:start position:0%
things relative to this issue
 
00:53:19.349 --> 00:53:19.359 align:start position:0%
let me share a few bullets with you
 
00:53:22.390 --> 00:53:22.400 align:start position:0%
number one abortion providers
 
00:53:24.950 --> 00:53:24.960 align:start position:0%
believe it or not require a transvaginal
 
00:53:28.470 --> 00:53:28.480 align:start position:0%
ultrasound to be performed during
 
00:53:31.589 --> 00:53:31.599 align:start position:0%
early stages of pregnancy but
 
00:53:34.309 --> 00:53:34.319 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's new law does not even
 
00:53:36.069 --> 00:53:36.079 align:start position:0%
mention this procedure and i bring that
 
00:53:38.950 --> 00:53:38.960 align:start position:0%
to your attention because
 
00:53:41.510 --> 00:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
i always watch what our legislators are
 
00:53:44.230 --> 00:53:44.240 align:start position:0%
doing i'm always interested in
 
00:53:47.430 --> 00:53:47.440 align:start position:0%
different viewpoints and what i saw over
 
00:53:49.910 --> 00:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
the last several months maybe six months
 
00:53:52.069 --> 00:53:52.079 align:start position:0%
is disinformation out there so i wanted
 
00:53:53.430 --> 00:53:53.440 align:start position:0%
to clarify
 
00:53:56.630 --> 00:53:56.640 align:start position:0%
that the fetal protection fetal life
 
00:53:59.030 --> 00:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
protection law has nothing to do with
 
00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:00.230 align:start position:0%
protection law has nothing to do with
trans

00:54:00.230 --> 00:54:00.240 align:start position:0%
trans
 
00:54:02.549 --> 00:54:02.559 align:start position:0%
vaginal ultrasounds
 
00:54:05.349 --> 00:54:05.359 align:start position:0%
the new fetal life protection law does
 
00:54:06.790 --> 00:54:06.800 align:start position:0%
not require
 
00:54:08.790 --> 00:54:08.800 align:start position:0%
any ultrasounds
 
00:54:10.390 --> 00:54:10.400 align:start position:0%
for early pregnancy
 
00:54:11.829 --> 00:54:11.839 align:start position:0%
as some have claimed and that's
 
00:54:14.309 --> 00:54:14.319 align:start position:0%
disinformation that i have seen over the
 
00:54:14.319 --> 00:54:15.510 align:start position:0%
disinformation that i have seen over the
months

00:54:15.510 --> 00:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
months
 
00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:17.030 align:start position:0%
months
so

00:54:17.030 --> 00:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:54:17.040 --> 00:54:17.829 align:start position:0%
so
the

00:54:17.829 --> 00:54:17.839 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:54:21.670 --> 00:54:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:23.750 align:start position:0%
 
requires

00:54:23.750 --> 00:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
requires
 
00:54:27.270 --> 00:54:27.280 align:start position:0%
an abdominal ultrasound or an obstetric
 
00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:28.950 align:start position:0%
an abdominal ultrasound or an obstetric
ultrasound

00:54:28.950 --> 00:54:28.960 align:start position:0%
ultrasound
 
00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:30.549 align:start position:0%
ultrasound
for

00:54:30.549 --> 00:54:30.559 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:54:32.630 --> 00:54:32.640 align:start position:0%
to help the physician
 
00:54:36.150 --> 00:54:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:39.430 --> 00:54:39.440 align:start position:0%
find objective information
 
00:54:42.549 --> 00:54:42.559 align:start position:0%
to determine the gestational um age of
 
00:54:45.270 --> 00:54:45.280 align:start position:0%
the infant the fetus
 
00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:47.829 align:start position:0%
the infant the fetus
so

00:54:47.829 --> 00:54:47.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:50.390 --> 00:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
if i were the young woman
 
00:54:53.510 --> 00:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
pregnant not knowing i have irregular
 
00:54:55.270 --> 00:54:55.280 align:start position:0%
menstrual periods
 
00:54:57.190 --> 00:54:57.200 align:start position:0%
and i have no idea
 
00:55:00.230 --> 00:55:00.240 align:start position:0%
whether i'm close to 24 weeks my
 
00:55:02.549 --> 00:55:02.559 align:start position:0%
physician or provider doesn't have a
 
00:55:04.150 --> 00:55:04.160 align:start position:0%
sense of it either
 
00:55:06.470 --> 00:55:06.480 align:start position:0%
then the ultrasound is required
 
00:55:07.430 --> 00:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
in this
 
00:55:10.630 --> 00:55:10.640 align:start position:0%
in this instance if termination of the
 
00:55:13.349 --> 00:55:13.359 align:start position:0%
pregnancy is being considered
 
00:55:13.359 --> 00:55:14.150 align:start position:0%
pregnancy is being considered
to

00:55:14.150 --> 00:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:55:16.630 --> 00:55:16.640 align:start position:0%
give objective evidence as to the life
 
00:55:18.230 --> 00:55:18.240 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:55:18.240 --> 00:55:19.349 align:start position:0%
of the
fetus

00:55:19.349 --> 00:55:19.359 align:start position:0%
fetus
 
00:55:21.109 --> 00:55:21.119 align:start position:0%
so i think that that's a good point i
 
00:55:23.349 --> 00:55:23.359 align:start position:0%
think it protects the physician
 
00:55:23.359 --> 00:55:25.109 align:start position:0%
think it protects the physician
because

00:55:25.109 --> 00:55:25.119 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:55:27.670 --> 00:55:27.680 align:start position:0%
the physician wants to make sure that
 
00:55:30.230 --> 00:55:30.240 align:start position:0%
they're working within the parameters of
 
00:55:32.950 --> 00:55:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:35.030 --> 00:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
um according to the new fetal life
 
00:55:36.789 --> 00:55:36.799 align:start position:0%
protection law an ultrasound shall be
 
00:55:39.349 --> 00:55:39.359 align:start position:0%
performed when there is substantial risk
 
00:55:43.829 --> 00:55:43.839 align:start position:0%
that the child could be 24 weeks or more
 
00:55:46.390 --> 00:55:46.400 align:start position:0%
the obstetric ultrasound requirement for
 
00:55:49.910 --> 00:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
advanced pregnancies in a sense again
 
00:55:52.549 --> 00:55:52.559 align:start position:0%
provides the provider
 
00:55:54.789 --> 00:55:54.799 align:start position:0%
my last bullet is the current fetal life
 
00:55:58.069 --> 00:55:58.079 align:start position:0%
protection act is not extreme as claimed
 
00:56:01.430 --> 00:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
by many and that's my opinion
 
00:56:04.470 --> 00:56:04.480 align:start position:0%
a six-month fetus is viable
 
00:56:07.589 --> 00:56:07.599 align:start position:0%
the fetus if born given the opportunity
 
00:56:09.670 --> 00:56:09.680 align:start position:0%
to be born
 
00:56:12.069 --> 00:56:12.079 align:start position:0%
is viable and can live outside
 
00:56:13.829 --> 00:56:13.839 align:start position:0%
especially with all our medical
 
00:56:16.390 --> 00:56:16.400 align:start position:0%
advancements over the last decades
 
00:56:18.390 --> 00:56:18.400 align:start position:0%
there's no reason to believe that we
 
00:56:21.430 --> 00:56:21.440 align:start position:0%
could not support life until full full
 
00:56:23.910 --> 00:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
um gestation and that's just been just
 
00:56:25.510 --> 00:56:25.520 align:start position:0%
over three minutes so if you have one
 
00:56:27.829 --> 00:56:27.839 align:start position:0%
last thing to wrap it up um and i'll
 
00:56:30.710 --> 00:56:30.720 align:start position:0%
leave you with the supreme court
 
00:56:33.109 --> 00:56:33.119 align:start position:0%
decision in casey planned parenthood
 
00:56:36.390 --> 00:56:36.400 align:start position:0%
versus casey in quote in some broad
 
00:56:38.390 --> 00:56:38.400 align:start position:0%
sense it might be said that a woman who
 
00:56:40.150 --> 00:56:40.160 align:start position:0%
fails to act
 
00:56:43.349 --> 00:56:43.359 align:start position:0%
before viability has consented to the
 
00:56:45.910 --> 00:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
state's intervention on behalf of the
 
00:56:47.670 --> 00:56:47.680 align:start position:0%
developing child and we are talking
 
00:56:49.510 --> 00:56:49.520 align:start position:0%
about the developing child
 
00:56:50.870 --> 00:56:50.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:56:50.880 --> 00:56:51.829 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

00:56:51.829 --> 00:56:51.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:55.349 --> 00:56:55.359 align:start position:0%
identity and questions if there are any
 
00:56:57.670 --> 00:56:57.680 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
 
00:56:59.190 --> 00:56:59.200 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i'll hand the gavel
 
00:57:09.430 --> 00:57:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:11.510 --> 00:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes matthew hood to
 
00:57:11.520 --> 00:57:13.750 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes matthew hood to
speak

00:57:13.750 --> 00:57:13.760 align:start position:0%
speak
 
00:57:25.030 --> 00:57:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:26.309 --> 00:57:26.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair members of the
 
00:57:28.069 --> 00:57:28.079 align:start position:0%
committee yes my name is matthew hood
 
00:57:29.510 --> 00:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
i'm the vice president for government
 
00:57:32.870 --> 00:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
relations at dartmouth-hitchcock
 
00:57:34.549 --> 00:57:34.559 align:start position:0%
dartmouth hitchcock opposed the fetal
 
00:57:35.990 --> 00:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
protection act last year for several
 
00:57:37.910 --> 00:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
reasons some of which would be addressed
 
00:57:39.270 --> 00:57:39.280 align:start position:0%
in this bill
 
00:57:40.710 --> 00:57:40.720 align:start position:0%
and for other reasons that this bill
 
00:57:43.190 --> 00:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
does not address as such we offer our
 
00:57:45.190 --> 00:57:45.200 align:start position:0%
support for some of the provisions of
 
00:57:47.990 --> 00:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
1609 but do not feel that this bill goes
 
00:57:51.589 --> 00:57:51.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:54.150 --> 00:57:54.160 align:start position:0%
the parts of the bill
 
00:57:55.910 --> 00:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
that we support
 
00:57:58.549 --> 00:57:58.559 align:start position:0%
add back important exceptions including
 
00:58:00.870 --> 00:58:00.880 align:start position:0%
fatal fetal anomalies since while
 
00:58:03.190 --> 00:58:03.200 align:start position:0%
they're rare some are only detected
 
00:58:05.510 --> 00:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
after 24 weeks
 
00:58:07.430 --> 00:58:07.440 align:start position:0%
the law as it stands now not only
 
00:58:09.589 --> 00:58:09.599 align:start position:0%
intrudes upon a painful decision point
 
00:58:11.910 --> 00:58:11.920 align:start position:0%
for a pregnant woman but also takes away
 
00:58:13.589 --> 00:58:13.599 align:start position:0%
her choice
 
00:58:15.910 --> 00:58:15.920 align:start position:0%
now should a pregnant woman make the
 
00:58:17.910 --> 00:58:17.920 align:start position:0%
decision to terminate her pregnancy in
 
00:58:19.430 --> 00:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
this situation
 
00:58:20.630 --> 00:58:20.640 align:start position:0%
either our providers would be
 
00:58:20.640 --> 00:58:22.789 align:start position:0%
either our providers would be
criminalized

00:58:22.789 --> 00:58:22.799 align:start position:0%
criminalized
 
00:58:24.630 --> 00:58:24.640 align:start position:0%
she would have to go out of state for
 
00:58:24.640 --> 00:58:25.589 align:start position:0%
she would have to go out of state for
care

00:58:25.589 --> 00:58:25.599 align:start position:0%
care
 
00:58:27.190 --> 00:58:27.200 align:start position:0%
or she would be forced to carry a
 
00:58:30.390 --> 00:58:30.400 align:start position:0%
non-viable fetus to term
 
00:58:32.230 --> 00:58:32.240 align:start position:0%
and so while i don't think that this
 
00:58:33.750 --> 00:58:33.760 align:start position:0%
bill goes far enough as representative
 
00:58:36.390 --> 00:58:36.400 align:start position:0%
connor indicated in the discussion about
 
00:58:38.069 --> 00:58:38.079 align:start position:0%
criminalization of providers and the
 
00:58:39.990 --> 00:58:40.000 align:start position:0%
chilling effect that that would have it
 
00:58:43.750 --> 00:58:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:47.510 --> 00:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
as as our chair of ob testified last
 
00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:48.390 align:start position:0%
as as our chair of ob testified last
year

00:58:48.390 --> 00:58:48.400 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:58:50.789 --> 00:58:50.799 align:start position:0%
and others the threat of criminalization
 
00:58:52.870 --> 00:58:52.880 align:start position:0%
will have negative impacts on our
 
00:58:54.950 --> 00:58:54.960 align:start position:0%
ability as a major medical center to
 
00:58:57.589 --> 00:58:57.599 align:start position:0%
recruit providers including neo-data
 
00:58:57.599 --> 00:59:00.549 align:start position:0%
recruit providers including neo-data
specialists

00:59:00.549 --> 00:59:00.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:02.150 --> 00:59:02.160 align:start position:0%
not only at dartmouth-hitchcock but to
 
00:59:06.870 --> 00:59:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:08.549 --> 00:59:08.559 align:start position:0%
we also support the repeal of the
 
00:59:11.030 --> 00:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
ultrasound requirement since requiring
 
00:59:12.710 --> 00:59:12.720 align:start position:0%
across the board
 
00:59:14.630 --> 00:59:14.640 align:start position:0%
not only adds a barrier to women seeking
 
00:59:16.870 --> 00:59:16.880 align:start position:0%
care but it also removes the discretion
 
00:59:18.630 --> 00:59:18.640 align:start position:0%
from a provider who's trained with
 
00:59:20.470 --> 00:59:20.480 align:start position:0%
respect to when necessary and
 
00:59:23.349 --> 00:59:23.359 align:start position:0%
appropriate to provide ultrasound
 
00:59:25.589 --> 00:59:25.599 align:start position:0%
and finally i would just add a note
 
00:59:27.190 --> 00:59:27.200 align:start position:0%
hhs talked about the reporting
 
00:59:27.200 --> 00:59:28.390 align:start position:0%
hhs talked about the reporting
requirement

00:59:28.390 --> 00:59:28.400 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:30.470 align:start position:0%
requirement
challenges

00:59:30.470 --> 00:59:30.480 align:start position:0%
challenges
 
00:59:32.470 --> 00:59:32.480 align:start position:0%
what's not clear to me uh about the new
 
00:59:34.710 --> 00:59:34.720 align:start position:0%
reporting requirement is providers and
 
00:59:36.150 --> 00:59:36.160 align:start position:0%
facilities are required under the
 
00:59:37.589 --> 00:59:37.599 align:start position:0%
current law
 
00:59:39.750 --> 00:59:39.760 align:start position:0%
to report if an abortion is provided
 
00:59:41.910 --> 00:59:41.920 align:start position:0%
after 25 weeks due to the risk to a
 
00:59:45.349 --> 00:59:45.359 align:start position:0%
woman's life so i as i read it the data
 
00:59:47.270 --> 00:59:47.280 align:start position:0%
that's being sought now
 
00:59:49.589 --> 00:59:49.599 align:start position:0%
is also post 24 weeks so i'm not sure
 
00:59:50.710 --> 00:59:50.720 align:start position:0%
how that is
 
00:59:53.349 --> 00:59:53.359 align:start position:0%
different or necessary to be compiled
 
00:59:56.549 --> 00:59:56.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:58.470 --> 00:59:58.480 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
01:00:00.789 --> 01:00:00.799 align:start position:0%
from the committee yes representative
 
01:00:03.190 --> 01:00:03.200 align:start position:0%

01:00:09.270 --> 01:00:09.280 align:start position:0%
asked of representative kanark are there
 
01:00:12.390 --> 01:00:12.400 align:start position:0%
any times when um the mother would would
 
01:00:14.789 --> 01:00:14.799 align:start position:0%
be able to deliver that baby early
 
01:00:17.190 --> 01:00:17.200 align:start position:0%
either through an induced labor or a
 
01:00:19.510 --> 01:00:19.520 align:start position:0%
cesarean where she would be better
 
01:00:21.990 --> 01:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
served by terminating that child before
 
01:00:23.510 --> 01:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
delivering them either through an
 
01:00:25.750 --> 01:00:25.760 align:start position:0%
induced abortion or through a surgical
 
01:00:28.150 --> 01:00:28.160 align:start position:0%
abortion thank you for the question uh
 
01:00:30.789 --> 01:00:30.799 align:start position:0%
representative leon um i'm the vice
 
01:00:32.710 --> 01:00:32.720 align:start position:0%
president for government relations not a
 
01:00:34.390 --> 01:00:34.400 align:start position:0%
clinician's at dartmouth-hitchcock so i
 
01:00:35.829 --> 01:00:35.839 align:start position:0%
can't answer that question but i'd be
 
01:00:39.589 --> 01:00:39.599 align:start position:0%
happy to talk to our ob providers
 
01:00:41.750 --> 01:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions from mr
 
01:00:44.789 --> 01:00:44.799 align:start position:0%
hood yes representative cushman
 
01:00:46.390 --> 01:00:46.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
01:00:49.510 --> 01:00:49.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question um were physicians
 
01:00:51.829 --> 01:00:51.839 align:start position:0%
deterred from working in massachusetts
 
01:00:54.710 --> 01:00:54.720 align:start position:0%
when abortions after six months were
 
01:00:58.230 --> 01:00:58.240 align:start position:0%
banned prior to december 2020.
 
01:01:00.390 --> 01:01:00.400 align:start position:0%
so i can't speak to the physician
 
01:01:01.589 --> 01:01:01.599 align:start position:0%
conduct in
 
01:01:04.230 --> 01:01:04.240 align:start position:0%
or reaction to laws in massachusetts but
 
01:01:05.990 --> 01:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that exceptions
 
01:01:08.150 --> 01:01:08.160 align:start position:0%
exist in the massachusetts law that do
 
01:01:10.950 --> 01:01:10.960 align:start position:0%
not in the new hampshire law
 
01:01:14.470 --> 01:01:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:16.069 --> 01:01:16.079 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
01:01:16.950 --> 01:01:16.960 align:start position:0%
very much
 
01:01:19.109 --> 01:01:19.119 align:start position:0%

01:01:38.549 --> 01:01:38.559 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:01:40.309 --> 01:01:40.319 align:start position:0%
was involved during the community
 
01:01:43.190 --> 01:01:43.200 align:start position:0%
conference uh as this law passed into
 
01:01:46.390 --> 01:01:46.400 align:start position:0%
hb2 so i'm a little bit familiar with
 
01:01:49.430 --> 01:01:49.440 align:start position:0%
the the background into the thinking
 
01:01:52.470 --> 01:01:52.480 align:start position:0%
and i just i just want to remind people
 
01:01:53.750 --> 01:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
because there has been so much
 
01:01:55.829 --> 01:01:55.839 align:start position:0%
intentional misinformation about what
 
01:01:57.029 --> 01:01:57.039 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:01:59.990 --> 01:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
what this legislation did it did i
 
01:02:02.069 --> 01:02:02.079 align:start position:0%
to emphasize that there has been
 
01:02:03.750 --> 01:02:03.760 align:start position:0%
representative don't use the word
 
01:02:05.430 --> 01:02:05.440 align:start position:0%
intentional please
 
01:02:07.270 --> 01:02:07.280 align:start position:0%
um there has been
 
01:02:10.390 --> 01:02:10.400 align:start position:0%
a lot of information out in the public
 
01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:11.589 align:start position:0%
a lot of information out in the public
domain

01:02:11.589 --> 01:02:11.599 align:start position:0%
domain
 
01:02:13.589 --> 01:02:13.599 align:start position:0%
that i don't think was meant to
 
01:02:16.710 --> 01:02:16.720 align:start position:0%
elucidate the facts about the bill
 
01:02:18.150 --> 01:02:18.160 align:start position:0%
for example
 
01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:19.270 align:start position:0%
for example
um

01:02:19.270 --> 01:02:19.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:21.910 --> 01:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
it said that 24 weeks is an extreme
 
01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:22.950 align:start position:0%
it said that 24 weeks is an extreme
position

01:02:22.950 --> 01:02:22.960 align:start position:0%
position
 
01:02:27.109 --> 01:02:27.119 align:start position:0%
24 weeks is uh extremely well accepted
 
01:02:29.190 --> 01:02:29.200 align:start position:0%
uh in society in
 
01:02:32.309 --> 01:02:32.319 align:start position:0%
western civilization we were the 43rd
 
01:02:35.750 --> 01:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
state to say that 24 weeks is where we
 
01:02:38.390 --> 01:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
begin to recognize life and start to
 
01:02:41.270 --> 01:02:41.280 align:start position:0%
treat the uh the baby the yet to be born
 
01:02:45.990 --> 01:02:46.000 align:start position:0%
baby as a human entitled to human rights
 
01:02:49.109 --> 01:02:49.119 align:start position:0%
also every european nation recognizes
 
01:02:51.510 --> 01:02:51.520 align:start position:0%
that by the 24th week they're dealing
 
01:02:53.910 --> 01:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
with an uh with a human being
 
01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:54.710 align:start position:0%
with an uh with a human being
so

01:02:54.710 --> 01:02:54.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:02:58.069 --> 01:02:58.079 align:start position:0%
um i think it whatever we do to this
 
01:02:59.829 --> 01:02:59.839 align:start position:0%
bill it should be done from the
 
01:03:02.470 --> 01:03:02.480 align:start position:0%
perspective of
 
01:03:04.630 --> 01:03:04.640 align:start position:0%
at 24 weeks we're dealing with human
 
01:03:08.309 --> 01:03:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:12.150 --> 01:03:12.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:15.029 --> 01:03:15.039 align:start position:0%
it may sound crude but it's so obvious
 
01:03:19.430 --> 01:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
that a woman knows at moment zero
 
01:03:22.309 --> 01:03:22.319 align:start position:0%
if she's a victim of rape or incest
 
01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:25.520 align:start position:0%
there are 24 weeks for for the woman her
 
01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:26.630 align:start position:0%
there are 24 weeks for for the woman her
physician

01:03:26.630 --> 01:03:26.640 align:start position:0%
physician
 
01:03:28.870 --> 01:03:28.880 align:start position:0%
hopefully the father of the child to
 
01:03:30.710 --> 01:03:30.720 align:start position:0%
come to a conclusion about what the
 
01:03:32.390 --> 01:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
right thing to do is whether or not they
 
01:03:33.349 --> 01:03:33.359 align:start position:0%
want to
 
01:03:34.470 --> 01:03:34.480 align:start position:0%
bring that
 
01:03:37.750 --> 01:03:37.760 align:start position:0%
that that that baby to full term 24
 
01:03:39.990 --> 01:03:40.000 align:start position:0%
weeks is a long time
 
01:03:42.150 --> 01:03:42.160 align:start position:0%
i checked at west virginia university
 
01:03:43.670 --> 01:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
where i used to be a
 
01:03:45.670 --> 01:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
radiology administrator and i talked to
 
01:03:48.549 --> 01:03:48.559 align:start position:0%
the academic physician that teaches
 
01:03:51.829 --> 01:03:51.839 align:start position:0%
ultrasound practice for that university
 
01:03:54.470 --> 01:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
and one of the things he mentioned to me
 
01:03:56.549 --> 01:03:56.559 align:start position:0%
that i think is relevant
 
01:03:59.589 --> 01:03:59.599 align:start position:0%
due to some of the scare tactics over
 
01:04:03.190 --> 01:04:03.200 align:start position:0%
transvaginal uh ultrasound a term that
 
01:04:05.829 --> 01:04:05.839 align:start position:0%
is not in our law it's obstetric
 
01:04:09.029 --> 01:04:09.039 align:start position:0%
ultrasound but what was mentioned to me
 
01:04:09.039 --> 01:04:09.750 align:start position:0%
ultrasound but what was mentioned to me
is

01:04:09.750 --> 01:04:09.760 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:04:12.069 --> 01:04:12.079 align:start position:0%
after an abortion in order to make sure
 
01:04:14.470 --> 01:04:14.480 align:start position:0%
that a woman is completely free of any
 
01:04:18.069 --> 01:04:18.079 align:start position:0%
biowaste from the uh the procedure they
 
01:04:20.789 --> 01:04:20.799 align:start position:0%
it's normal to do a transvaginal
 
01:04:22.870 --> 01:04:22.880 align:start position:0%
ultrasound to make sure that the woman
 
01:04:26.069 --> 01:04:26.079 align:start position:0%
is clean and if and if and if all the
 
01:04:28.470 --> 01:04:28.480 align:start position:0%
bile waste hasn't been removed she's at
 
01:04:32.630 --> 01:04:32.640 align:start position:0%
severe risk of um incurring sepsis which
 
01:04:33.990 --> 01:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
can be deadly
 
01:04:38.230 --> 01:04:38.240 align:start position:0%
so um so i hope as we debate this we can
 
01:04:41.589 --> 01:04:41.599 align:start position:0%
debate it in honest ways
 
01:04:44.630 --> 01:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
taking a look at how valuable life is to
 
01:04:45.990 --> 01:04:46.000 align:start position:0%
each of us
 
01:04:47.750 --> 01:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
and with that i'm done if you have
 
01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:49.109 align:start position:0%
and with that i'm done if you have
questions

01:04:49.109 --> 01:04:49.119 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:04:53.589 --> 01:04:53.599 align:start position:0%
any questions for representative edwards
 
01:04:57.270 --> 01:04:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:01.349 --> 01:05:01.359 align:start position:0%
and representative john graham he has uh
 
01:05:03.990 --> 01:05:04.000 align:start position:0%

01:05:08.630 --> 01:05:08.640 align:start position:0%
i will attempt to pass out
 
01:05:10.870 --> 01:05:10.880 align:start position:0%

which is the town of bedford
 
01:05:29.990 --> 01:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
this bill is introduced correctly what
 
01:05:33.190 --> 01:05:33.200 align:start position:0%
in my mind a couple of grievous errors
 
01:05:35.109 --> 01:05:35.119 align:start position:0%
in what we passed last june in house
 
01:05:38.230 --> 01:05:38.240 align:start position:0%
bill 2. that is not to say
 
01:05:40.549 --> 01:05:40.559 align:start position:0%
that i am supportive of late-term
 
01:05:40.559 --> 01:05:41.990 align:start position:0%
that i am supportive of late-term
abortions

01:05:41.990 --> 01:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
abortions
 
01:05:44.549 --> 01:05:44.559 align:start position:0%
because i am not but there are elements
 
01:05:46.710 --> 01:05:46.720 align:start position:0%
of the so-called fetal protection act
 
01:05:49.270 --> 01:05:49.280 align:start position:0%
that need to be changed in my mind
 
01:05:51.510 --> 01:05:51.520 align:start position:0%
first is the absolute requirement for an
 
01:05:53.750 --> 01:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
ultrasound prior to having any abortion
 
01:05:56.390 --> 01:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
performed regardless of the stage of the
 
01:05:56.400 --> 01:05:57.510 align:start position:0%
performed regardless of the stage of the
pregnancy

01:05:57.510 --> 01:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
pregnancy
 
01:06:00.470 --> 01:06:00.480 align:start position:0%
you'll hear that this is always not not
 
01:06:02.829 --> 01:06:02.839 align:start position:0%
always non-invasive
 
01:06:05.510 --> 01:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
procedure but i can tell you that
 
01:06:07.910 --> 01:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
categorically it is during the first
 
01:06:09.190 --> 01:06:09.200 align:start position:0%
couple months
 
01:06:11.670 --> 01:06:11.680 align:start position:0%
as many of you know my wife and i had a
 
01:06:14.069 --> 01:06:14.079 align:start position:0%
baby daughter last november
 
01:06:16.309 --> 01:06:16.319 align:start position:0%
as part of our routine checkups during
 
01:06:18.950 --> 01:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
the pregnancy were ultrasounds to
 
01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:19.829 align:start position:0%
the pregnancy were ultrasounds to
measure

01:06:19.829 --> 01:06:19.839 align:start position:0%
measure
 
01:06:23.270 --> 01:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
the gestational progress of the fetus
 
01:06:25.109 --> 01:06:25.119 align:start position:0%
i can tell you haven't been in the room
 
01:06:26.870 --> 01:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
while they were conducted
 
01:06:28.470 --> 01:06:28.480 align:start position:0%
that these ultrasound
 
01:06:30.390 --> 01:06:30.400 align:start position:0%
sounds done during the first three
 
01:06:33.829 --> 01:06:33.839 align:start position:0%
months were done vaginally
 
01:06:35.270 --> 01:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
think of what that may mean in other
 
01:06:37.589 --> 01:06:37.599 align:start position:0%
circumstances remember in what we pass
 
01:06:39.510 --> 01:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
there is no exemptions for rape
 
01:06:41.750 --> 01:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
therefore a victim of rape who wishes to
 
01:06:43.990 --> 01:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
terminate a pregnancy that results from
 
01:06:47.190 --> 01:06:47.200 align:start position:0%
that violent act must endure an invasive
 
01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:49.510 align:start position:0%
that violent act must endure an invasive
procedure

01:06:49.510 --> 01:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
procedure
 
01:06:52.230 --> 01:06:52.240 align:start position:0%
is this really what we want to do to a
 
01:06:55.510 --> 01:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
young woman who has had that um
 
01:06:57.910 --> 01:06:57.920 align:start position:0%
act perpetrated upon her
 
01:07:01.349 --> 01:07:01.359 align:start position:0%
i don't think so second while in current
 
01:07:03.750 --> 01:07:03.760 align:start position:0%
law we are concerned with the life of
 
01:07:06.549 --> 01:07:06.559 align:start position:0%
the month mother we are largely silent
 
01:07:08.390 --> 01:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
on the health of the mother i realize
 
01:07:10.630 --> 01:07:10.640 align:start position:0%
that there are some factors in there
 
01:07:12.950 --> 01:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
but this bill corrects part of that
 
01:07:15.270 --> 01:07:15.280 align:start position:0%
omission and it does talk about the
 
01:07:17.430 --> 01:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
health of the mother
 
01:07:19.589 --> 01:07:19.599 align:start position:0%
likewise the current law is silent on
 
01:07:21.990 --> 01:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
the viability of the fetus if it is
 
01:07:23.670 --> 01:07:23.680 align:start position:0%
brought to term
 
01:07:26.390 --> 01:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
a full anatomy scan a level two
 
01:07:29.430 --> 01:07:29.440 align:start position:0%
ultrasound is routinely given between
 
01:07:32.390 --> 01:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
the 18th and 22nd months
 
01:07:35.190 --> 01:07:35.200 align:start position:0%
weeks of the pregnancy it is at this
 
01:07:38.549 --> 01:07:38.559 align:start position:0%
point that many physical issues
 
01:07:41.190 --> 01:07:41.200 align:start position:0%
that deal with viability
 
01:07:43.270 --> 01:07:43.280 align:start position:0%
after birth are noted
 
01:07:46.230 --> 01:07:46.240 align:start position:0%
note that i said as late as the 22nd
 
01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:47.910 align:start position:0%
note that i said as late as the 22nd
week

01:07:47.910 --> 01:07:47.920 align:start position:0%
week
 
01:07:50.150 --> 01:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
if something is found at that point and
 
01:07:52.870 --> 01:07:52.880 align:start position:0%
the parents opt for some discussion
 
01:07:55.750 --> 01:07:55.760 align:start position:0%
prayer second opinion before making a
 
01:07:57.829 --> 01:07:57.839 align:start position:0%
decision we could easily hit the
 
01:08:01.029 --> 01:08:01.039 align:start position:0%
arbitrary 24th week i think that we need
 
01:08:02.789 --> 01:08:02.799 align:start position:0%
to reconsider
 
01:08:05.349 --> 01:08:05.359 align:start position:0%
what that means about viability
 
01:08:09.029 --> 01:08:09.039 align:start position:0%
and and the 24th week
 
01:08:11.589 --> 01:08:11.599 align:start position:0%
window that we've established
 
01:08:15.990 --> 01:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
thank you and as a co-sponsor of hb 1609
 
01:08:17.749 --> 01:08:17.759 align:start position:0%
i urge that you find this critical
 
01:08:20.070 --> 01:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
health care bill ought to pass
 
01:08:22.709 --> 01:08:22.719 align:start position:0%
will the representative take questions
 
01:08:27.590 --> 01:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:30.309 --> 01:08:30.319 align:start position:0%
i know i don't i'll try
 
01:08:34.149 --> 01:08:34.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:36.309 --> 01:08:36.319 align:start position:0%
representative cushman
 
01:08:37.910 --> 01:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:08:39.990 --> 01:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:08:42.309 --> 01:08:42.319 align:start position:0%
um so the criminal penalty section of
 
01:08:44.630 --> 01:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
the law says that a provider is only
 
01:08:46.390 --> 01:08:46.400 align:start position:0%
punished for violation if they're
 
01:08:48.229 --> 01:08:48.239 align:start position:0%
conscious of a substantial risk that the
 
01:08:49.510 --> 01:08:49.520 align:start position:0%
fetus is
 
01:08:52.950 --> 01:08:52.960 align:start position:0%
greater than 24 weeks old so
 
01:08:55.110 --> 01:08:55.120 align:start position:0%
um in your understanding
 
01:08:58.070 --> 01:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
what what criminal penalties would you
 
01:08:59.990 --> 01:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
think would be applied this this bill
 
01:09:01.349 --> 01:09:01.359 align:start position:0%
does not
 
01:09:04.630 --> 01:09:04.640 align:start position:0%
address that um provision of law with
 
01:09:07.590 --> 01:09:07.600 align:start position:0%
the criminal penalties that stays
 
01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:08.470 align:start position:0%
the criminal penalties that stays
so

01:09:08.470 --> 01:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:09:08.480 --> 01:09:09.349 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:09:09.349 --> 01:09:09.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:13.030 --> 01:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:14.149 --> 01:09:14.159 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:09:14.159 --> 01:09:15.510 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

01:09:15.510 --> 01:09:15.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:17.430 --> 01:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
well the understanding is that if a
 
01:09:20.309 --> 01:09:20.319 align:start position:0%
fetus is not approximating
 
01:09:22.309 --> 01:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
or there's no risk that the fetus is
 
01:09:23.990 --> 01:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
approximating 24 weeks that an
 
01:09:25.590 --> 01:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
ultrasound won't be done do you
 
01:09:28.390 --> 01:09:28.400 align:start position:0%
understand that 12 weeks the time when a
 
01:09:32.070 --> 01:09:32.080 align:start position:0%
transvaginal ultrasound would be
 
01:09:35.590 --> 01:09:35.600 align:start position:0%
utilized at latest that that's nowhere
 
01:09:37.110 --> 01:09:37.120 align:start position:0%
near that and it's unlikely that that
 
01:09:38.870 --> 01:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
would ever be necessary
 
01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:42.789 align:start position:0%
would ever be necessary
um

01:09:42.789 --> 01:09:42.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:45.829 --> 01:09:45.839 align:start position:0%
i i still think that that requiring the
 
01:09:47.669 --> 01:09:47.679 align:start position:0%
ultrasounds especially during the first
 
01:09:49.669 --> 01:09:49.679 align:start position:0%
three months
 
01:09:51.910 --> 01:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
is unnecessary once you get to the
 
01:09:54.950 --> 01:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
fourth or fifth month
 
01:09:57.750 --> 01:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
and when it is done
 
01:10:02.229 --> 01:10:02.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:06.470 --> 01:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
perhaps um it could be used uh that way
 
01:10:09.430 --> 01:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
to try to determine gestational
 
01:10:11.350 --> 01:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
age but i'll tell you
 
01:10:13.669 --> 01:10:13.679 align:start position:0%
my wife and i knew the exact date
 
01:10:15.270 --> 01:10:15.280 align:start position:0%
because it was by in virtual
 
01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:16.790 align:start position:0%
because it was by in virtual
feudalization

01:10:16.790 --> 01:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
feudalization
 
01:10:19.110 --> 01:10:19.120 align:start position:0%
during these ultrasounds we got
 
01:10:21.669 --> 01:10:21.679 align:start position:0%
variations of up to a week
 
01:10:21.679 --> 01:10:22.630 align:start position:0%
variations of up to a week
um

01:10:22.630 --> 01:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:24.630 --> 01:10:24.640 align:start position:0%
with the ultrasounds
 
01:10:27.510 --> 01:10:27.520 align:start position:0%
so you know just using that
 
01:10:30.950 --> 01:10:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:33.189 --> 01:10:33.199 align:start position:0%
an absolute way to determine whether
 
01:10:36.390 --> 01:10:36.400 align:start position:0%
it's 12 14 or 25 weeks
 
01:10:38.870 --> 01:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
that's my opinion and that's having just
 
01:10:43.510 --> 01:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:45.830 --> 01:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
01:10:48.870 --> 01:10:48.880 align:start position:0%
representative representative folsom
 
01:10:50.709 --> 01:10:50.719 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
01:10:53.110 --> 01:10:53.120 align:start position:0%
taking my question um i think i just
 
01:10:56.550 --> 01:10:56.560 align:start position:0%
want to clarify one of the issues and a
 
01:10:58.390 --> 01:10:58.400 align:start position:0%
couple of people have spoken to this and
 
01:10:58.400 --> 01:10:59.350 align:start position:0%
couple of people have spoken to this and
so

01:10:59.350 --> 01:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:11:02.310 --> 01:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
do you is it your understanding of the
 
01:11:03.990 --> 01:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
bill that
 
01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:04.870 align:start position:0%
bill that
um

01:11:04.870 --> 01:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:07.189 --> 01:11:07.199 align:start position:0%
ultrasounds would be required at any
 
01:11:10.229 --> 01:11:10.239 align:start position:0%
stage during the pregnancy if there was
 
01:11:12.630 --> 01:11:12.640 align:start position:0%
going to be an abortion that is the way
 
01:11:15.990 --> 01:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
i read what was in house bill 2 yes
 
01:11:18.390 --> 01:11:18.400 align:start position:0%
if that was clarified
 
01:11:21.350 --> 01:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
with an amendment where it was made
 
01:11:23.350 --> 01:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
perfectly clear
 
01:11:25.669 --> 01:11:25.679 align:start position:0%
that we that an
 
01:11:29.510 --> 01:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
ultrasound is not required until 24
 
01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:30.550 align:start position:0%
ultrasound is not required until 24
weeks

01:11:30.550 --> 01:11:30.560 align:start position:0%
weeks
 
01:11:33.990 --> 01:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
would that be acceptable to you
 
01:11:36.470 --> 01:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
perhaps i'd have to see the language and
 
01:11:38.550 --> 01:11:38.560 align:start position:0%
i would also like to try to figure out
 
01:11:40.470 --> 01:11:40.480 align:start position:0%
how would you how would you know that it
 
01:11:43.110 --> 01:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
was 24 weeks you would probably have to
 
01:11:45.350 --> 01:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
specify it at some point
 
01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:47.669 align:start position:0%
specify it at some point
earlier

01:11:47.669 --> 01:11:47.679 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
01:11:49.669 --> 01:11:49.679 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that be something that the
 
01:11:49.679 --> 01:11:50.630 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that be something that the
doctor

01:11:50.630 --> 01:11:50.640 align:start position:0%
doctor
 
01:11:53.830 --> 01:11:53.840 align:start position:0%
and the mother could approximate and say
 
01:11:56.630 --> 01:11:56.640 align:start position:0%
uh i'm not sure if it's 24 weeks we're
 
01:11:59.030 --> 01:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
close maybe we should do the ultrasound
 
01:12:01.110 --> 01:12:01.120 align:start position:0%
to make sure is that something that
 
01:12:03.669 --> 01:12:03.679 align:start position:0%
would be i i would again i would have to
 
01:12:05.590 --> 01:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
see the exact language and how it would
 
01:12:09.430 --> 01:12:09.440 align:start position:0%
be applied okay thank you very much
 
01:12:13.590 --> 01:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:15.110 --> 01:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
thank you chair
 
01:12:17.350 --> 01:12:17.360 align:start position:0%
mr chairman for taking my question and
 
01:12:20.870 --> 01:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative um
 
01:12:22.950 --> 01:12:22.960 align:start position:0%
my question is mainly one of
 
01:12:26.550 --> 01:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
clarification i i'm um
 
01:12:28.550 --> 01:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
i went through six pregnancies two that
 
01:12:31.430 --> 01:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
we lost one was a natural miscarriage
 
01:12:32.950 --> 01:12:32.960 align:start position:0%
well this and this both of them were
 
01:12:34.830 --> 01:12:34.840 align:start position:0%
natural second one was an
 
01:12:36.950 --> 01:12:36.960 align:start position:0%
ectopic and
 
01:12:40.229 --> 01:12:40.239 align:start position:0%
i um i don't ever remember
 
01:12:42.070 --> 01:12:42.080 align:start position:0%
being in a sonogram with my wife where
 
01:12:45.990 --> 01:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
it was evasive so can you clarify why
 
01:12:47.750 --> 01:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
why because my wife wanted me in the
 
01:12:49.830 --> 01:12:49.840 align:start position:0%
room while it was done it was that
 
01:12:54.630 --> 01:12:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:57.510 --> 01:12:57.520 align:start position:0%
the basis is that she was as they said a
 
01:12:59.750 --> 01:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
geriatric pregnancy
 
01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:00.630 align:start position:0%
geriatric pregnancy
um

01:13:00.630 --> 01:13:00.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:03.430 --> 01:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
then she had had miscarriages in in the
 
01:13:06.390 --> 01:13:06.400 align:start position:0%
past um so they wanted to make sure that
 
01:13:09.750 --> 01:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
the fetus was developing normally but it
 
01:13:12.790 --> 01:13:12.800 align:start position:0%
is not uncommon to to do that in the
 
01:13:15.189 --> 01:13:15.199 align:start position:0%
first couple of months to measure the
 
01:13:15.199 --> 01:13:16.070 align:start position:0%
first couple of months to measure the
growth

01:13:16.070 --> 01:13:16.080 align:start position:0%
growth
 
01:13:18.470 --> 01:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
and to see if there are any anomalies
 
01:13:20.630 --> 01:13:20.640 align:start position:0%
that are showing up at that point
 
01:13:24.229 --> 01:13:24.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:29.590 --> 01:13:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:31.350 --> 01:13:31.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
01:13:33.189 --> 01:13:33.199 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
01:13:35.110 --> 01:13:35.120 align:start position:0%
can you point to anywhere in the in the
 
01:13:38.950 --> 01:13:38.960 align:start position:0%
existing law that refers to transvaginal
 
01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:40.550 align:start position:0%
existing law that refers to transvaginal
ultrasound

01:13:40.550 --> 01:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
ultrasound
 
01:13:44.149 --> 01:13:44.159 align:start position:0%
it says ultrasound and in the first
 
01:13:45.350 --> 01:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
in my
 
01:13:47.270 --> 01:13:47.280 align:start position:0%
experience and understanding in the
 
01:13:49.669 --> 01:13:49.679 align:start position:0%
first three months they are not done
 
01:13:51.910 --> 01:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
over the the stomach they are done
 
01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:53.110 align:start position:0%
over the the stomach they are done
internally

01:13:53.110 --> 01:13:53.120 align:start position:0%
internally
 
01:13:55.030 --> 01:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
so that's where
 
01:13:57.350 --> 01:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
that's where it is
 
01:14:03.350 --> 01:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:05.430 --> 01:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
i should have taken you up on walking
 
01:14:08.709 --> 01:14:08.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:11.750 --> 01:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:13.510 --> 01:14:13.520 align:start position:0%
representative leon
 
01:14:15.270 --> 01:14:15.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:14:16.790 --> 01:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
one last question
 
01:14:18.310 --> 01:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
would you believe that i've had three
 
01:14:20.229 --> 01:14:20.239 align:start position:0%
pregnancies and the only time i had a
 
01:14:22.550 --> 01:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
transvaginal ultrasound was when we were
 
01:14:24.470 --> 01:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
trying to determine if a surprise
 
01:14:26.470 --> 01:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
pregnancy was a topic or not because it
 
01:14:28.390 --> 01:14:28.400 align:start position:0%
was thought to be a belief and that all
 
01:14:30.149 --> 01:14:30.159 align:start position:0%
of my other ones after that even eight
 
01:14:33.669 --> 01:14:33.679 align:start position:0%
weeks ten weeks were all trans abdominal
 
01:14:35.030 --> 01:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
i would believe that that is your
 
01:14:40.790 --> 01:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:43.510 --> 01:14:43.520 align:start position:0%
you're free to go and congratulations on
 
01:14:44.630 --> 01:14:44.640 align:start position:0%
this uh
 
01:14:47.189 --> 01:14:47.199 align:start position:0%
and by the way i i hope most people do
 
01:14:48.870 --> 01:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
that but
 
01:14:50.790 --> 01:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
by the way i am a cigar smoker and i'm
 
01:14:52.550 --> 01:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
still waiting
 
01:14:55.270 --> 01:14:55.280 align:start position:0%
i gave up smoking years ago i didn't so
 
01:15:00.310 --> 01:15:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:02.550 --> 01:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
it is the custom in committee hearings
 
01:15:04.630 --> 01:15:04.640 align:start position:0%
to call on
 
01:15:07.350 --> 01:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
representatives first because often they
 
01:15:09.830 --> 01:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
have to go to other meetings in the
 
01:15:12.070 --> 01:15:12.080 align:start position:0%
building the chair recognizes
 
01:15:24.070 --> 01:15:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:25.510 --> 01:15:25.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you members
 
01:15:27.189 --> 01:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is matthew
 
01:15:29.430 --> 01:15:29.440 align:start position:0%
simon i'm representative from grafton
 
01:15:31.350 --> 01:15:31.360 align:start position:0%
district 14. i reside in littleton new
 
01:15:33.350 --> 01:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire i'm here today to speak in
 
01:15:36.390 --> 01:15:36.400 align:start position:0%
opposition to hb 1609.
 
01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:37.669 align:start position:0%
opposition to hb 1609.
i

01:15:37.669 --> 01:15:37.679 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:15:39.189 --> 01:15:39.199 align:start position:0%
think at the moment it would be most
 
01:15:41.510 --> 01:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
helpful for me to clarify this issue
 
01:15:42.950 --> 01:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
regarding the ultrasound which seems to
 
01:15:44.630 --> 01:15:44.640 align:start position:0%
have come to the forefront of the
 
01:15:46.470 --> 01:15:46.480 align:start position:0%
conversation and explain why the fetal
 
01:15:48.310 --> 01:15:48.320 align:start position:0%
life protection act doesn't require an
 
01:15:50.950 --> 01:15:50.960 align:start position:0%
ultrasound prior to the 24 week period
 
01:15:52.470 --> 01:15:52.480 align:start position:0%
representative cushman was alluding to
 
01:15:53.669 --> 01:15:53.679 align:start position:0%
it in her questioning i'd just like to
 
01:15:56.229 --> 01:15:56.239 align:start position:0%
make it as clear as i possibly can so
 
01:15:57.830 --> 01:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
the fetal life protection act has
 
01:15:59.189 --> 01:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
several different
 
01:16:01.750 --> 01:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
elements to it separate sections to them
 
01:16:03.590 --> 01:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
the first one
 
01:16:06.709 --> 01:16:06.719 align:start position:0%
rsa 329 colon 44 deals with the
 
01:16:09.189 --> 01:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
ultrasound requirement if you take that
 
01:16:10.310 --> 01:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
particular part of the fetal life
 
01:16:12.950 --> 01:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
protection act in isolation and you read
 
01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:13.990 align:start position:0%
protection act in isolation and you read
it

01:16:13.990 --> 01:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:16:16.470 --> 01:16:16.480 align:start position:0%
removed from the rest of the law i can
 
01:16:18.310 --> 01:16:18.320 align:start position:0%
completely see why you would come to the
 
01:16:20.390 --> 01:16:20.400 align:start position:0%
conclusion that an ultrasound would be
 
01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:22.149 align:start position:0%
conclusion that an ultrasound would be
required

01:16:22.149 --> 01:16:22.159 align:start position:0%
required
 
01:16:24.630 --> 01:16:24.640 align:start position:0%
throughout pregnancy regardless of the
 
01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:25.590 align:start position:0%
throughout pregnancy regardless of the
time

01:16:25.590 --> 01:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:16:27.910 --> 01:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
but if you go down two more sections to
 
01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:31.149 align:start position:0%
but if you go down two more sections to
rsa

01:16:31.149 --> 01:16:31.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:33.189 --> 01:16:33.199 align:start position:0%
344-46 i think
 
01:16:35.430 --> 01:16:35.440 align:start position:0%
346. uh you'll see the criminal criminal
 
01:16:37.830 --> 01:16:37.840 align:start position:0%
penalties section and in that section
 
01:16:38.950 --> 01:16:38.960 align:start position:0%
i'll actually read it for you because
 
01:16:40.550 --> 01:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
it'll be helpful
 
01:16:42.709 --> 01:16:42.719 align:start position:0%
it explicitly states that the only thing
 
01:16:48.470 --> 01:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:51.910 --> 01:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
ultrasounds at the 24 week period so 329
 
01:16:54.149 --> 01:16:54.159 align:start position:0%
46 criminal penalties any health care
 
01:16:56.390 --> 01:16:56.400 align:start position:0%
provider who knowingly performs or
 
01:16:58.310 --> 01:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
induces an abortion in violation of this
 
01:17:00.310 --> 01:17:00.320 align:start position:0%
subdivision and knows that the fetus has
 
01:17:02.709 --> 01:17:02.719 align:start position:0%
a gestational age of at least 24 weeks
 
01:17:04.870 --> 01:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
or consciously disregards a substantial
 
01:17:06.470 --> 01:17:06.480 align:start position:0%
risk that the fetus has a gestational
 
01:17:08.950 --> 01:17:08.960 align:start position:0%
age of at least 24 weeks shall be guilty
 
01:17:11.030 --> 01:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
of a class b felony and in addition to
 
01:17:12.870 --> 01:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
any other penalties the court may impose
 
01:17:14.709 --> 01:17:14.719 align:start position:0%
be fined not less than 10 000 and not
 
01:17:16.870 --> 01:17:16.880 align:start position:0%
more than a hundred thousand dollars
 
01:17:18.790 --> 01:17:18.800 align:start position:0%
so when taken within the context of the
 
01:17:21.030 --> 01:17:21.040 align:start position:0%
whole law the state only has a legal
 
01:17:23.669 --> 01:17:23.679 align:start position:0%
interest in whether or not um
 
01:17:26.390 --> 01:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
the provider had uh was provided an
 
01:17:29.110 --> 01:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
ultrasound uh at a time where there's a
 
01:17:29.990 --> 01:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
question of whether there's a
 
01:17:31.750 --> 01:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
substantial risk that they're at the 24
 
01:17:34.229 --> 01:17:34.239 align:start position:0%
week mark or they've actually reached 24
 
01:17:36.390 --> 01:17:36.400 align:start position:0%
weeks that's the only thing that the law
 
01:17:38.310 --> 01:17:38.320 align:start position:0%
is concerned with so that even if a
 
01:17:41.189 --> 01:17:41.199 align:start position:0%
provider gives an ultrasound earlier in
 
01:17:43.110 --> 01:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
the pregnancy because the doctor is
 
01:17:44.630 --> 01:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
concerned well i don't want to be on the
 
01:17:46.310 --> 01:17:46.320 align:start position:0%
hook for this i want to have an
 
01:17:47.669 --> 01:17:47.679 align:start position:0%
ultrasound taken just so that i can
 
01:17:49.669 --> 01:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
watch my back uh the only thing that
 
01:17:51.590 --> 01:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
he's trying to determine is whether or
 
01:17:53.830 --> 01:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
not that fetus is at 24 weeks you don't
 
01:17:56.070 --> 01:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
need a transvaginal ultrasound to
 
01:17:58.390 --> 01:17:58.400 align:start position:0%
determine whether an eight-week-old baby
 
01:18:01.669 --> 01:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
is 24 weeks uh an external ultrasound
 
01:18:03.669 --> 01:18:03.679 align:start position:0%
will do that just fine you can put some
 
01:18:05.270 --> 01:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
jelly on the belly and take a picture
 
01:18:07.510 --> 01:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
and you can tell perfectly well
 
01:18:09.030 --> 01:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
we don't need to know if the child is
 
01:18:10.149 --> 01:18:10.159 align:start position:0%
eight weeks we don't need to know if the
 
01:18:11.510 --> 01:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
child is ten weeks we don't need to know
 
01:18:13.590 --> 01:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
if the child is 12 weeks we only need to
 
01:18:16.229 --> 01:18:16.239 align:start position:0%
know that the child is not 24 weeks and
 
01:18:16.239 --> 01:18:17.110 align:start position:0%
know that the child is not 24 weeks and
that's

01:18:17.110 --> 01:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:18:19.030 --> 01:18:19.040 align:start position:0%
easily observable through
 
01:18:21.910 --> 01:18:21.920 align:start position:0%
an external ultrasound uh so
 
01:18:24.070 --> 01:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
the bill itself the law i apologize at
 
01:18:25.669 --> 01:18:25.679 align:start position:0%
this point the field life protection act
 
01:18:27.430 --> 01:18:27.440 align:start position:0%
uh does not require that it does not
 
01:18:29.350 --> 01:18:29.360 align:start position:0%
even infer that it was not the intent of
 
01:18:32.070 --> 01:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
the bill um and for folsom's point uh
 
01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:34.790 align:start position:0%
the bill um and for folsom's point uh

regretfully
 
01:19:50.709 --> 01:19:50.719 align:start position:0%
had a reproductive loss myself in 1993
 
01:19:53.430 --> 01:19:53.440 align:start position:0%
and six years later almost took my life
 
01:19:56.229 --> 01:19:56.239 align:start position:0%
so with really recognizing the sanctity
 
01:19:58.550 --> 01:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
of life and the importance of life
 
01:19:59.990 --> 01:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
there was a mention of the movie

scott
 
01:20:04.790 --> 01:20:04.800 align:start position:0%
she was actually the woman that played
 
01:20:06.550 --> 01:20:06.560 align:start position:0%
the face of planned parent in the movie
 
01:20:06.560 --> 01:20:07.910 align:start position:0%
the face of planned parent in the movie
unplanned

01:20:07.910 --> 01:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
unplanned
 
01:20:09.510 --> 01:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
she would actually was actually a backup
 
01:20:11.910 --> 01:20:11.920 align:start position:0%
singer for prince before she actually
 
01:20:13.990 --> 01:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
ended up getting into full-time ministry
 
01:20:15.590 --> 01:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
with her husband
 
01:20:17.990 --> 01:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
but she now runs an organization that
 
01:20:19.990 --> 01:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
deals with counterfeit comforts and it's
 
01:20:21.830 --> 01:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
people turning to
 
01:20:24.070 --> 01:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
drugs or alcohol or any other type of
 
01:20:26.070 --> 01:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
counterfeit comfort because of the pain
 
01:20:29.030 --> 01:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
and shame of terminating a pregnancy so
 
01:20:31.669 --> 01:20:31.679 align:start position:0%
as far as this bill goes i really hope
 
01:20:33.669 --> 01:20:33.679 align:start position:0%
and pray that the decisions being made
 
01:20:35.669 --> 01:20:35.679 align:start position:0%
will be opposing this because at any
 
01:20:37.350 --> 01:20:37.360 align:start position:0%
time i mean
 
01:20:39.350 --> 01:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
we are a bible-believing
 
01:20:41.990 --> 01:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
god-fearing nation last time i checked
 
01:20:44.310 --> 01:20:44.320 align:start position:0%
and uh the founding fathers were god
 
01:20:46.550 --> 01:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
fearing bible-believing men
 
01:20:49.189 --> 01:20:49.199 align:start position:0%
and i just hope and pray that there will
 
01:20:51.270 --> 01:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
be opposition to this bill
 
01:20:53.430 --> 01:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
because it terrifies me that the thought
 
01:20:55.830 --> 01:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
of life is just so flippant and so
 
01:20:58.070 --> 01:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
flippantly taken um it was mentioned
 
01:21:00.950 --> 01:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
also about the case of rape
 
01:21:03.669 --> 01:21:03.679 align:start position:0%
how does murdering a child then make a
 
01:21:07.510 --> 01:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
rape a solution to a horrific
 
01:21:09.750 --> 01:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
interaction between a man and a woman to
 
01:21:11.669 --> 01:21:11.679 align:start position:0%
then take the life of a child
 
01:21:13.910 --> 01:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
which only then perpetuates even more
 
01:21:15.750 --> 01:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
pain and shame
 
01:21:18.070 --> 01:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
so um i don't know
 
01:21:19.030 --> 01:21:19.040 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:21:20.709 --> 01:21:20.719 align:start position:0%
all the ins and outs of this bill i
 
01:21:22.390 --> 01:21:22.400 align:start position:0%
actually was not even here for this bill
 
01:21:24.550 --> 01:21:24.560 align:start position:0%
i was here for another purpose but i
 
01:21:26.070 --> 01:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
have a
 
01:21:27.590 --> 01:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
funny feeling that god has a way of
 
01:21:30.070 --> 01:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
working all things together for good
 
01:21:30.080 --> 01:21:31.189 align:start position:0%
working all things together for good
so

01:21:31.189 --> 01:21:31.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:21:32.950 --> 01:21:32.960 align:start position:0%
if there's any questions about my story
 
01:21:35.350 --> 01:21:35.360 align:start position:0%
or how i if i will tell you
 
01:21:36.950 --> 01:21:36.960 align:start position:0%

01:21:49.350 --> 01:21:49.360 align:start position:0%
child inside me i guarantee you my
 
01:21:50.709 --> 01:21:50.719 align:start position:0%

01:21:52.239 --> 01:21:53.030 align:start position:0%

01:21:55.110 --> 01:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
um for that if there's any questions i'd
 
01:21:57.189 --> 01:21:57.199 align:start position:0%
be happy to provide any answers to any
 
01:22:01.830 --> 01:22:01.840 align:start position:0%

this bill takes the criteria for a

a woman is less than 24 weeks pregnant

01:24:27.189 --> 01:24:27.199 align:start position:0%

01:24:54.310 --> 01:24:54.320 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
01:24:55.910 --> 01:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
these are all things that any pregnant
 
01:24:58.790 --> 01:24:58.800 align:start position:0%
woman should hope would be taken into
 
01:25:01.270 --> 01:25:01.280 align:start position:0%
account before any kind of medical
 
01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:02.709 align:start position:0%
account before any kind of medical
procedure

01:25:02.709 --> 01:25:02.719 align:start position:0%
procedure
 
01:25:04.390 --> 01:25:04.400 align:start position:0%
what's the rush
 
01:25:06.310 --> 01:25:06.320 align:start position:0%
this statute was voted on
 
01:25:09.350 --> 01:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
by a majority last session and it just
 
01:25:10.790 --> 01:25:10.800 align:start position:0%
hit the books
 
01:25:14.310 --> 01:25:14.320 align:start position:0%
give it more than 10 business days
 
01:25:16.870 --> 01:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
uh i'm happy to answer any questions
 
01:25:19.030 --> 01:25:19.040 align:start position:0%
are there any questions dr woods
 
01:25:20.709 --> 01:25:20.719 align:start position:0%
representative woods
 
01:25:22.870 --> 01:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair and uh thank you
 
01:25:24.390 --> 01:25:24.400 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
01:25:26.950 --> 01:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
um relative to the free i mean that's uh
 
01:25:29.189 --> 01:25:29.199 align:start position:0%
certainly a big benefit uh will that
 
01:25:31.990 --> 01:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
continue uh with the current uh
 
01:25:34.070 --> 01:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
uh emil you in which we find the
 
01:25:37.189 --> 01:25:37.199 align:start position:0%
defunding of many of these centers yes
 
01:25:38.550 --> 01:25:38.560 align:start position:0%
most of these segments centers that
 
01:25:40.149 --> 01:25:40.159 align:start position:0%
offer free ultrasounds are privately
 
01:25:40.159 --> 01:25:44.149 align:start position:0%
offer free ultrasounds are privately
funded

01:25:44.149 --> 01:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:47.110 --> 01:25:47.120 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
01:25:48.709 --> 01:25:48.719 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for your testimony
 
01:25:50.870 --> 01:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:25:53.270 --> 01:25:53.280 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes dr richard johnson
 
01:26:16.550 --> 01:26:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:18.629 --> 01:26:18.639 align:start position:0%
mr chairman and members of the committee
 
01:26:20.790 --> 01:26:20.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my testimony i'm
 
01:26:24.870 --> 01:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
here to speak against house bill 1609
 
01:26:27.110 --> 01:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
excuse me basically for the reasons that
 
01:26:29.510 --> 01:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
you have already heard so i will be very
 
01:26:31.590 --> 01:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
uh succinct in this
 
01:26:34.629 --> 01:26:34.639 align:start position:0%
uh in a matter of for saving time
 
01:26:37.510 --> 01:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
one uh removing the ultrasound
 
01:26:39.990 --> 01:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
is requirement is not necessary most
 
01:26:41.910 --> 01:26:41.920 align:start position:0%
women receive two ultrasounds during
 
01:26:43.430 --> 01:26:43.440 align:start position:0%
pregnancy the first in the first
 
01:26:45.830 --> 01:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
trimester to confirm the due date and
 
01:26:47.430 --> 01:26:47.440 align:start position:0%
the second around as has already been
 
01:26:49.910 --> 01:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
said 18 to 22 weeks to confirm normal
 
01:26:52.790 --> 01:26:52.800 align:start position:0%
anatomy of the developing baby
 
01:26:54.550 --> 01:26:54.560 align:start position:0%
the fetal protection act never mentions
 
01:26:57.030 --> 01:26:57.040 align:start position:0%
the use of a transvaginal ulcer sound
 
01:26:59.110 --> 01:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
that would not even be thought of at 24
 
01:27:00.950 --> 01:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
weeks of gestation
 
01:27:03.030 --> 01:27:03.040 align:start position:0%
secondly if a woman has been assaulted
 
01:27:05.750 --> 01:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
by rape or incest she has several months
 
01:27:07.830 --> 01:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
during which she should be encouraged to
 
01:27:09.910 --> 01:27:09.920 align:start position:0%
seek medical attention to document if
 
01:27:13.030 --> 01:27:13.040 align:start position:0%
she is pregnant and if she desires to at
 
01:27:15.750 --> 01:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
that time seek an abortion
 
01:27:17.990 --> 01:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
thirdly the use as has just been
 
01:27:19.910 --> 01:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
eloquently said the use of the word
 
01:27:22.950 --> 01:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
quote health in paragraph 3 line 23 and
 
01:27:26.149 --> 01:27:26.159 align:start position:0%
24 is very open-ended and has the
 
01:27:28.870 --> 01:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
potential to completely nullify any
 
01:27:31.430 --> 01:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
protection of the unborn baby let me
 
01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:32.629 align:start position:0%
protection of the unborn baby let me
explain

01:27:32.629 --> 01:27:32.639 align:start position:0%
explain
 
01:27:33.990 --> 01:27:34.000 align:start position:0%
according to the world health
 
01:27:35.590 --> 01:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
organization health is a state of
 
01:27:37.350 --> 01:27:37.360 align:start position:0%
complete physical mental and social
 
01:27:39.750 --> 01:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
well-being and not merely the absence of
 
01:27:41.590 --> 01:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
disease or infirmity
 
01:27:43.990 --> 01:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
and enjoyment of health is one of the
 
01:27:47.590 --> 01:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
fundamental rights of every human being
 
01:27:49.590 --> 01:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
our own cdc
 
01:27:53.030 --> 01:27:53.040 align:start position:0%
states that hedonic well-being meaning
 
01:27:56.470 --> 01:27:56.480 align:start position:0%
focusing on one's feelings
 
01:27:57.910 --> 01:27:57.920 align:start position:0%
or happiness
 
01:28:01.990 --> 01:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
is important and that you demonic
 
01:28:05.189 --> 01:28:05.199 align:start position:0%
well-being which focuses on the thinking
 
01:28:07.430 --> 01:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
component of well-being means how
 
01:28:09.590 --> 01:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
fulfilled do you feel
 
01:28:11.910 --> 01:28:11.920 align:start position:0%
at this time
 
01:28:15.350 --> 01:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
finally in to 1973 supreme court case of
 
01:28:17.750 --> 01:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
doe vs bolton stated that quote medical
 
01:28:19.830 --> 01:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
judgment may be exercised in the light
 
01:28:21.510 --> 01:28:21.520 align:start position:0%
of all factors physical emotional
 
01:28:23.510 --> 01:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
psychological familial and the woman's
 
01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:24.310 align:start position:0%
psychological familial and the woman's
age

01:28:24.310 --> 01:28:24.320 align:start position:0%
age
 
01:28:26.550 --> 01:28:26.560 align:start position:0%
relevant to the well-being of the
 
01:28:26.560 --> 01:28:27.750 align:start position:0%
relevant to the well-being of the
patient

01:28:27.750 --> 01:28:27.760 align:start position:0%
patient
 
01:28:30.709 --> 01:28:30.719 align:start position:0%
all these factors may relate to health
 
01:28:32.709 --> 01:28:32.719 align:start position:0%
end quote
 
01:28:34.950 --> 01:28:34.960 align:start position:0%
using these subjective guidelines it
 
01:28:37.110 --> 01:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
would be virtually impossible to
 
01:28:39.590 --> 01:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
disagree with a woman about her state of
 
01:28:40.950 --> 01:28:40.960 align:start position:0%
quote health
 
01:28:43.910 --> 01:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
and therefore her desire for an abortion
 
01:28:43.920 --> 01:28:44.950 align:start position:0%
and therefore her desire for an abortion
hence

01:28:44.950 --> 01:28:44.960 align:start position:0%
hence
 
01:28:48.470 --> 01:28:48.480 align:start position:0%
no protection for the unborn baby
 
01:28:50.550 --> 01:28:50.560 align:start position:0%
fourthly rather than trying to unravel
 
01:28:52.390 --> 01:28:52.400 align:start position:0%
the fetal protection act we should be
 
01:28:54.310 --> 01:28:54.320 align:start position:0%
supporting it because it is good medical
 
01:28:56.629 --> 01:28:56.639 align:start position:0%
practice as it protects
 
01:28:59.030 --> 01:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
the life of some of our most vulnerable
 
01:28:59.040 --> 01:29:00.149 align:start position:0%
the life of some of our most vulnerable
citizens

01:29:00.149 --> 01:29:00.159 align:start position:0%
citizens
 
01:29:03.030 --> 01:29:03.040 align:start position:0%
those who are about to be full term
 
01:29:03.040 --> 01:29:04.149 align:start position:0%
those who are about to be full term
babies

01:29:04.149 --> 01:29:04.159 align:start position:0%
babies
 
01:29:06.470 --> 01:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:29:08.550 --> 01:29:08.560 align:start position:0%
thank you doc thank you doctor would you
 
01:29:10.550 --> 01:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
take any questions certainly
 
01:29:12.629 --> 01:29:12.639 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
01:29:15.189 --> 01:29:15.199 align:start position:0%
representative folsom
 
01:29:17.510 --> 01:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you doctor
 
01:29:20.390 --> 01:29:20.400 align:start position:0%
for taking our questions um
 
01:29:25.430 --> 01:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
my question involves the ultrasound and
 
01:29:27.430 --> 01:29:27.440 align:start position:0%
i'm assuming that you do not perform
 
01:29:31.030 --> 01:29:31.040 align:start position:0%
abortions however if you were a doctor
 
01:29:33.750 --> 01:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
and someone wanted to do have an
 
01:29:35.990 --> 01:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
abortion and you provided that
 
01:29:38.149 --> 01:29:38.159 align:start position:0%
would an ultrasound actually help
 
01:29:40.390 --> 01:29:40.400 align:start position:0%
protect the woman
 
01:29:42.149 --> 01:29:42.159 align:start position:0%
who is about to have that procedure
 
01:29:45.350 --> 01:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
would it give the doctor more guidance
 
01:29:47.669 --> 01:29:47.679 align:start position:0%
as to the procedure
 
01:29:49.270 --> 01:29:49.280 align:start position:0%
it's a great question
 
01:29:51.669 --> 01:29:51.679 align:start position:0%
since i do not perform abortions i would
 
01:29:54.149 --> 01:29:54.159 align:start position:0%
never ask for an ultrasound to do one i
 
01:29:56.229 --> 01:29:56.239 align:start position:0%
don't know the answer to the question i
 
01:29:57.750 --> 01:29:57.760 align:start position:0%
can suspect
 
01:30:00.470 --> 01:30:00.480 align:start position:0%
as a physician i'm a retired surgeon
 
01:30:02.870 --> 01:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
the more information i have the better i
 
01:30:05.270 --> 01:30:05.280 align:start position:0%
am able to treat the patient correctly
 
01:30:07.910 --> 01:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
and so i would suspect but it's a
 
01:30:09.750 --> 01:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
suspect that if i were an abortion
 
01:30:12.149 --> 01:30:12.159 align:start position:0%
provider again the more information i
 
01:30:14.149 --> 01:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
had the better i could treat that
 
01:30:16.310 --> 01:30:16.320 align:start position:0%
patient safely because obviously i
 
01:30:19.669 --> 01:30:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:23.750 --> 01:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:26.149 --> 01:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you sir and would you
 
01:30:28.950 --> 01:30:28.960 align:start position:0%
mind giving your script to the clerk for
 
01:30:30.550 --> 01:30:30.560 align:start position:0%
our file please
 
01:30:42.550 --> 01:30:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:44.870 --> 01:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
not only does the clerk get one
 
01:30:59.510 --> 01:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:03.669 --> 01:31:03.679 align:start position:0%
i cannot divide 21 evenly
 
01:31:06.550 --> 01:31:06.560 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes laura l
 
01:31:09.430 --> 01:31:09.440 align:start position:0%

i'm here to ask that uh well thank you
 
01:31:21.350 --> 01:31:21.360 align:start position:0%
for listening to me i'm here to ask that
 
01:31:24.629 --> 01:31:24.639 align:start position:0%
you oppose hb 1609 and any other
 
01:31:26.229 --> 01:31:26.239 align:start position:0%
efforts to weaken the fetal life
 
01:31:27.830 --> 01:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
protection act
 
01:31:30.870 --> 01:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
um i have five children some of whom we
 
01:31:33.030 --> 01:31:33.040 align:start position:0%
adopted uh from the new hampshire foster
 
01:31:34.790 --> 01:31:34.800 align:start position:0%
care system
 
01:31:36.390 --> 01:31:36.400 align:start position:0%
and we found that many of the kids who
 
01:31:38.790 --> 01:31:38.800 align:start position:0%
wind up in foster care have very very
 
01:31:40.629 --> 01:31:40.639 align:start position:0%
difficult life stories
 
01:31:42.790 --> 01:31:42.800 align:start position:0%
some are so tragic that they're even
 
01:31:44.470 --> 01:31:44.480 align:start position:0%
used to justify
 
01:31:47.430 --> 01:31:47.440 align:start position:0%
abortion as a remedy
 
01:31:49.189 --> 01:31:49.199 align:start position:0%
and i invite you to see the foster care
 
01:31:51.590 --> 01:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
system as i do as
 
01:31:53.669 --> 01:31:53.679 align:start position:0%
a canary in a coal mine
 
01:31:55.510 --> 01:31:55.520 align:start position:0%
warning us of the perils of
 
01:31:58.950 --> 01:31:58.960 align:start position:0%
state-sanctioned violence an abortion
 
01:32:01.910 --> 01:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
most starkly late term abortion
 
01:32:03.430 --> 01:32:03.440 align:start position:0%
is exactly that
 
01:32:05.830 --> 01:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
it's raw killing power inflicted on the
 
01:32:08.070 --> 01:32:08.080 align:start position:0%
very weakest and most vulnerable

undercover of law
 
01:32:13.030 --> 01:32:13.040 align:start position:0%
when we accept the destruction of fully
 
01:32:15.189 --> 01:32:15.199 align:start position:0%
formed live and kicking babies in the
 
01:32:16.870 --> 01:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
womb as legitimate
 
01:32:19.350 --> 01:32:19.360 align:start position:0%
even for the greater good
 
01:32:21.910 --> 01:32:21.920 align:start position:0%
it only follows that newborns and young
 
01:32:24.870 --> 01:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
children will also suffer
 
01:32:27.030 --> 01:32:27.040 align:start position:0%
it is not the developmental age of the
 
01:32:27.040 --> 01:32:27.990 align:start position:0%
it is not the developmental age of the
child

01:32:27.990 --> 01:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
child
 
01:32:30.149 --> 01:32:30.159 align:start position:0%
but the attitude of adults that makes a
 
01:32:30.159 --> 01:32:32.790 align:start position:0%
but the attitude of adults that makes a
difference

01:32:32.790 --> 01:32:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:35.430 --> 01:32:35.440 align:start position:0%
there can be no justice in a society
 
01:32:37.110 --> 01:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
where every mother who holds her
 
01:32:40.310 --> 01:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
helpless newborn says in effect i love
 
01:32:40.320 --> 01:32:41.510 align:start position:0%
helpless newborn says in effect i love
you

01:32:41.510 --> 01:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:32:43.590 --> 01:32:43.600 align:start position:0%
yesterday i had the power to slaughter
 
01:32:46.229 --> 01:32:46.239 align:start position:0%
you but i chose not to
 
01:32:47.750 --> 01:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
this is tyranny
 
01:32:50.310 --> 01:32:50.320 align:start position:0%
and it's an especially insidious variety
 
01:32:53.350 --> 01:32:53.360 align:start position:0%
because it attacks first and foremost
 
01:32:56.310 --> 01:32:56.320 align:start position:0%
the natural essential bond between
 
01:32:58.470 --> 01:32:58.480 align:start position:0%
parent and child that is the very
 
01:33:02.550 --> 01:33:02.560 align:start position:0%
building block of a humane society
 
01:33:06.070 --> 01:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
we are all every one of us affected
 
01:33:09.189 --> 01:33:09.199 align:start position:0%
and so as a society we have got to stop
 
01:33:09.199 --> 01:33:10.709 align:start position:0%
and so as a society we have got to stop
rethink

01:33:10.709 --> 01:33:10.719 align:start position:0%
rethink
 
01:33:13.910 --> 01:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
uphold the dignity and worth of babies
 
01:33:15.270 --> 01:33:15.280 align:start position:0%
in the womb
 
01:33:18.629 --> 01:33:18.639 align:start position:0%
or we can expect more cruelty inflicted
 
01:33:21.189 --> 01:33:21.199 align:start position:0%
on little daughters and sons
 
01:33:25.030 --> 01:33:25.040 align:start position:0%
we will see more children disappearing
 
01:33:26.709 --> 01:33:26.719 align:start position:0%
and we will witness more appalling
 
01:33:26.719 --> 01:33:27.750 align:start position:0%
and we will witness more appalling
images

01:33:27.750 --> 01:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
images
 
01:33:30.070 --> 01:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
like last week's video of a new mexico

01:33:39.910 --> 01:33:39.920 align:start position:0%
all of you have the power to defend the
 
01:33:43.030 --> 01:33:43.040 align:start position:0%
powerless before and after birth
 
01:33:45.030 --> 01:33:45.040 align:start position:0%
and i ask that you please preserve the
 
01:33:47.350 --> 01:33:47.360 align:start position:0%
field life protection act as it is
 
01:33:47.360 --> 01:33:48.229 align:start position:0%

written
 
01:33:50.550 --> 01:33:50.560 align:start position:0%
thank you would you take any questions
 
01:33:51.990 --> 01:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
if you have any
 
01:33:54.950 --> 01:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
well let me try one
 
01:33:57.030 --> 01:33:57.040 align:start position:0%
have you observed
 
01:33:59.669 --> 01:33:59.679 align:start position:0%
that since abortion has become much more
 
01:33:59.679 --> 01:34:01.350 align:start position:0%
that since abortion has become much more
widespread

01:34:01.350 --> 01:34:01.360 align:start position:0%
widespread
 
01:34:03.270 --> 01:34:03.280 align:start position:0%
and even legal
 
01:34:05.510 --> 01:34:05.520 align:start position:0%
there's a slippery slope
 
01:34:07.270 --> 01:34:07.280 align:start position:0%

over there somewhere
 
01:34:16.950 --> 01:34:16.960 align:start position:0%
so as to die
 
01:34:20.629 --> 01:34:20.639 align:start position:0%

01:34:20.639 --> 01:34:21.910 align:start position:0%
legal in a few places maybe soon more
and

01:34:21.910 --> 01:34:21.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:34:21.920 --> 01:34:23.430 align:start position:0%
and
societally

01:34:23.430 --> 01:34:23.440 align:start position:0%
societally
 
01:34:25.910 --> 01:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
it's now okay to toss a child in a
 
01:34:27.750 --> 01:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
dumpster have you observed a slippery
 
01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:29.189 align:start position:0%
dumpster have you observed a slippery
slope

01:34:29.189 --> 01:34:29.199 align:start position:0%
slope
 
01:34:31.590 --> 01:34:31.600 align:start position:0%
mr chairman it's a very
 
01:34:33.990 --> 01:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
small step
 
01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:34.870 align:start position:0%
small step
from

01:34:34.870 --> 01:34:34.880 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:34:37.750 --> 01:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
killing a child fully formed in the womb
 
01:34:39.430 --> 01:34:39.440 align:start position:0%
that we can all see
 
01:34:41.270 --> 01:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
looks just like the baby that comes out
 
01:34:44.790 --> 01:34:44.800 align:start position:0%
a day later it's very small step from
 
01:34:47.590 --> 01:34:47.600 align:start position:0%
that to mistreating the newborn child
 
01:34:49.510 --> 01:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
and that
 
01:34:51.990 --> 01:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
that attitude that
 
01:34:54.470 --> 01:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
small defenseless children
 
01:34:56.550 --> 01:34:56.560 align:start position:0%
totally dependent on adults
 
01:34:58.790 --> 01:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
are disposable
 
01:35:01.830 --> 01:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
it bleeds all through our society
 
01:35:03.430 --> 01:35:03.440 align:start position:0%
and it makes some very tragic
 
01:35:05.109 --> 01:35:05.119 align:start position:0%
differences in the lives of small
 
01:35:05.119 --> 01:35:06.709 align:start position:0%

children

01:35:06.709 --> 01:35:06.719 align:start position:0%

01:35:48.790 --> 01:35:48.800 align:start position:0%
when i discovered i was pregnant at 22
 
01:35:51.030 --> 01:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
and unmarried i immediately set a date
 
01:35:53.350 --> 01:35:53.360 align:start position:0%
for an abortion at the recommendation of
 
01:35:54.629 --> 01:35:54.639 align:start position:0%
my doctor
 
01:35:56.790 --> 01:35:56.800 align:start position:0%
the insurance at my job at the time
 
01:35:59.350 --> 01:35:59.360 align:start position:0%
would even cover all expenses
 
01:36:01.109 --> 01:36:01.119 align:start position:0%
after a few days of wrestling with my
 
01:36:02.870 --> 01:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
decision i decided to cancel the
 
01:36:04.550 --> 01:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
appointment and moved instead in the
 
01:36:06.629 --> 01:36:06.639 align:start position:0%
direction of adoption
 
01:36:09.270 --> 01:36:09.280 align:start position:0%
my daughter was born in may of 1982 and
 
01:36:11.750 --> 01:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
she became the sheer joy of a couple who
 
01:36:14.550 --> 01:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
were unable to conceive
 
01:36:16.550 --> 01:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
three years later my husband and i
 
01:36:18.390 --> 01:36:18.400 align:start position:0%
discovered we were pregnant with a baby
 
01:36:18.400 --> 01:36:19.270 align:start position:0%
discovered we were pregnant with a baby
boy

01:36:19.270 --> 01:36:19.280 align:start position:0%
boy
 
01:36:22.070 --> 01:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
and we were overjoyed however after some
 
01:36:25.270 --> 01:36:25.280 align:start position:0%
testing and an amniocentesis
 
01:36:27.430 --> 01:36:27.440 align:start position:0%
it was determined that
 
01:36:30.310 --> 01:36:30.320 align:start position:0%
quote the possibility of fetal anomalies
 
01:36:31.910 --> 01:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
is significant
 
01:36:34.870 --> 01:36:34.880 align:start position:0%
impending intrauterine fetal demise or
 
01:36:38.070 --> 01:36:38.080 align:start position:0%
severe intrauterine growth retardation
 
01:36:40.149 --> 01:36:40.159 align:start position:0%
are also possibilities
 
01:36:42.629 --> 01:36:42.639 align:start position:0%
another possibility is congenital
 
01:36:42.639 --> 01:36:44.070 align:start position:0%
another possibility is congenital
nephrosis

01:36:44.070 --> 01:36:44.080 align:start position:0%
nephrosis
 
01:36:46.790 --> 01:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
although so some infants can survive for
 
01:36:49.669 --> 01:36:49.679 align:start position:0%
a short time it appears that congenital
 
01:36:52.709 --> 01:36:52.719 align:start position:0%
nephrosis is inevitably fatal
 
01:36:55.350 --> 01:36:55.360 align:start position:0%
this fetus is at extremely high risk for
 
01:36:57.109 --> 01:36:57.119 align:start position:0%
having some other type of fetal
 
01:37:01.030 --> 01:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
abnormality or impending fetal demise
 
01:37:04.310 --> 01:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
if the pregnancy continues to viability
 
01:37:06.790 --> 01:37:06.800 align:start position:0%
etc etc
 
01:37:09.270 --> 01:37:09.280 align:start position:0%
as you can imagine we were devastated at
 
01:37:11.189 --> 01:37:11.199 align:start position:0%
this news but rejected the
 
01:37:13.189 --> 01:37:13.199 align:start position:0%
recommendation of the doctor to end the
 
01:37:15.669 --> 01:37:15.679 align:start position:0%
life of our baby boy in the womb rather
 
01:37:17.750 --> 01:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
than choose life
 
01:37:21.430 --> 01:37:21.440 align:start position:0%
adam wesley was born in june of 1985 and
 
01:37:23.510 --> 01:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
was whisked away from us immediately
 
01:37:26.310 --> 01:37:26.320 align:start position:0%
upon delivery to be inspected for any
 
01:37:26.320 --> 01:37:28.229 align:start position:0%
upon delivery to be inspected for any
abnormalities

01:37:28.229 --> 01:37:28.239 align:start position:0%
abnormalities
 
01:37:30.470 --> 01:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
he was brought back to us a short time
 
01:37:31.990 --> 01:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
later and told
 
01:37:34.390 --> 01:37:34.400 align:start position:0%
you have a perfectly healthy
 
01:37:36.709 --> 01:37:36.719 align:start position:0%
baby boy
 
01:37:39.270 --> 01:37:39.280 align:start position:0%
20 years and 10 months later during the
 
01:37:40.709 --> 01:37:40.719 align:start position:0%
mother's day floods here in new
 
01:37:43.109 --> 01:37:43.119 align:start position:0%
hampshire in 2006
 
01:37:45.510 --> 01:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
his life did come to an end
 
01:37:47.350 --> 01:37:47.360 align:start position:0%
when his car veered off the road and he
 
01:37:49.270 --> 01:37:49.280 align:start position:0%
was killed instantly while driving home
 
01:37:51.270 --> 01:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
from liberty university
 
01:37:53.430 --> 01:37:53.440 align:start position:0%
trying to make it home to me
 
01:37:56.550 --> 01:37:56.560 align:start position:0%
on mother's day to surprise me
 
01:38:00.550 --> 01:38:00.560 align:start position:0%
little did i know 24 years before that i
 
01:38:03.030 --> 01:38:03.040 align:start position:0%
would be i it would be the daughter i
 
01:38:05.030 --> 01:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
had given up for adoption
 
01:38:07.270 --> 01:38:07.280 align:start position:0%
who would be the balm my broken heart
 
01:38:09.430 --> 01:38:09.440 align:start position:0%
needed while grieving the death of my
 
01:38:11.109 --> 01:38:11.119 align:start position:0%
second child
 
01:38:13.510 --> 01:38:13.520 align:start position:0%
she had come to find us just 20 months
 
01:38:15.350 --> 01:38:15.360 align:start position:0%
before adam's death
 
01:38:17.109 --> 01:38:17.119 align:start position:0%
she calls me mom
 
01:38:19.830 --> 01:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
she phones me at least once a day
 
01:38:23.030 --> 01:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
and it is as if we were never separated
 
01:38:25.189 --> 01:38:25.199 align:start position:0%
i often think of the loss i would have
 
01:38:28.550 --> 01:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
faced if i had decided on abortion for

01:40:50.390 --> 01:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
he is non-verbal he's in a wheelchair he
 
01:40:53.669 --> 01:40:53.679 align:start position:0%
has one strong arm that he relies on
 
01:40:55.430 --> 01:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
to do just about everything that he can
 
01:40:55.440 --> 01:40:56.709 align:start position:0%
to do just about everything that he can
do

01:40:56.709 --> 01:40:56.719 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:40:58.950 --> 01:40:58.960 align:start position:0%
i help him with everything else
 
01:41:01.990 --> 01:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
and it has been just a sheer
 
01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:03.109 align:start position:0%
and it has been just a sheer
joy

01:41:03.109 --> 01:41:03.119 align:start position:0%
joy
 
01:41:05.590 --> 01:41:05.600 align:start position:0%
and a great privilege
 
01:41:07.590 --> 01:41:07.600 align:start position:0%
to to have done that
 
01:41:09.910 --> 01:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
and to to serve him
 
01:41:12.870 --> 01:41:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:14.950 --> 01:41:14.960 align:start position:0%
i just want to say that we oppose this
 
01:41:16.629 --> 01:41:16.639 align:start position:0%
because um
 
01:41:18.390 --> 01:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
when jeff was
 
01:41:18.400 --> 01:41:19.669 align:start position:0%
when jeff was
born

01:41:19.669 --> 01:41:19.679 align:start position:0%
born
 
01:41:21.910 --> 01:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
the doctor said he wouldn't live six
 
01:41:25.030 --> 01:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
months just take him home to die
 
01:41:27.350 --> 01:41:27.360 align:start position:0%
and of course these parents had no clue
 
01:41:29.830 --> 01:41:29.840 align:start position:0%
at that point he's 50 years old
 
01:41:30.870 --> 01:41:30.880 align:start position:0%
so he
 
01:41:33.430 --> 01:41:33.440 align:start position:0%
at that time they didn't have those tech
 
01:41:36.870 --> 01:41:36.880 align:start position:0%
technologies to to forewarn as much as
 
01:41:38.149 --> 01:41:38.159 align:start position:0%
they do now
 
01:41:40.070 --> 01:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
so they were terrified they went home
 
01:41:43.109 --> 01:41:43.119 align:start position:0%
expecting their baby boy to die and
 
01:41:45.109 --> 01:41:45.119 align:start position:0%
you know he's now 50.
 
01:41:48.229 --> 01:41:48.239 align:start position:0%
and his mother was advised to
 
01:41:50.229 --> 01:41:50.239 align:start position:0%
not have any more children or if she did
 
01:41:53.189 --> 01:41:53.199 align:start position:0%
have children to have them aborted
 
01:41:55.270 --> 01:41:55.280 align:start position:0%
and so they were so scared they waited
 
01:41:57.910 --> 01:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
eight years to have another baby
 
01:41:59.750 --> 01:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
and then they did have two
 
01:42:02.709 --> 01:42:02.719 align:start position:0%
beautiful healthy perfect
 
01:42:04.629 --> 01:42:04.639 align:start position:0%
baby boys as well
 
01:42:06.790 --> 01:42:06.800 align:start position:0%
but jeff is the big brother
 
01:42:08.390 --> 01:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
and i think they would even tell you
 
01:42:10.149 --> 01:42:10.159 align:start position:0%
that he has been
 
01:42:12.870 --> 01:42:12.880 align:start position:0%
truly a big brother in their lives
 
01:42:15.830 --> 01:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
in the courage in the fortitude in the
 
01:42:17.430 --> 01:42:17.440 align:start position:0%
fight that he has
 
01:42:18.709 --> 01:42:18.719 align:start position:0%
to live
 
01:42:22.870 --> 01:42:22.880 align:start position:0%
as normal a life as he does in fact
 
01:42:25.270 --> 01:42:25.280 align:start position:0%
you know we call these people disabled
 
01:42:25.280 --> 01:42:26.470 align:start position:0%
you know we call these people disabled
but

01:42:26.470 --> 01:42:26.480 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:42:28.629 --> 01:42:28.639 align:start position:0%
they're really a lot more able in so
 
01:42:31.590 --> 01:42:31.600 align:start position:0%
many ways than we are and they share
 
01:42:33.189 --> 01:42:33.199 align:start position:0%
that with us when we give them the
 
01:42:36.070 --> 01:42:36.080 align:start position:0%
chance if we recognize them and we we
 
01:42:38.149 --> 01:42:38.159 align:start position:0%
look at them as more than what they
 
01:42:39.830 --> 01:42:39.840 align:start position:0%
appear to be because you would never
 
01:42:42.390 --> 01:42:42.400 align:start position:0%
know that jeff was even in there when
 
01:42:44.629 --> 01:42:44.639 align:start position:0%
you look at him and
 
01:42:46.629 --> 01:42:46.639 align:start position:0%
he almost died until he was able to
 
01:42:48.790 --> 01:42:48.800 align:start position:0%
speak through an ipad which he learned
 
01:42:52.229 --> 01:42:52.239 align:start position:0%
at 20 because he nobody saw him but he's
 
01:42:52.239 --> 01:42:53.510 align:start position:0%
at 20 because he nobody saw him but he's
brilliant

01:42:53.510 --> 01:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
brilliant
 
01:42:55.430 --> 01:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
and he is a lover of god and he's a
 
01:42:57.030 --> 01:42:57.040 align:start position:0%
lover of man
 
01:43:00.229 --> 01:43:00.239 align:start position:0%
and he has inspired so many people that
 
01:43:02.149 --> 01:43:02.159 align:start position:0%
we come across that have known him over
 
01:43:03.590 --> 01:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
his years
 
01:43:06.070 --> 01:43:06.080 align:start position:0%
of being in the community his mother and
 
01:43:07.669 --> 01:43:07.679 align:start position:0%
father advocated for him to do
 
01:43:09.510 --> 01:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
everything as normal as possible he's
 
01:43:10.950 --> 01:43:10.960 align:start position:0%
held jobs
 
01:43:14.709 --> 01:43:14.719 align:start position:0%
and he's he's a responsible he votes
 
01:43:17.350 --> 01:43:17.360 align:start position:0%
he's a he's a responsible citizen
 
01:43:19.750 --> 01:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
and a great inspiration
 
01:43:21.510 --> 01:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:43:25.189 --> 01:43:25.199 align:start position:0%
i've gotten to to um
 
01:43:27.669 --> 01:43:27.679 align:start position:0%
to understand so much about the human
 
01:43:29.990 --> 01:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
nature of people with disabilities that
 
01:43:32.709 --> 01:43:32.719 align:start position:0%
are such unique gifts to us so can we
 
01:43:34.950 --> 01:43:34.960 align:start position:0%
really make that judgment call by
 
01:43:38.550 --> 01:43:38.560 align:start position:0%
formulating bills to to take away the
 
01:43:40.310 --> 01:43:40.320 align:start position:0%
life of somebody in the womb that we
 
01:43:43.350 --> 01:43:43.360 align:start position:0%
cannot even calculate the value of and i
 
01:43:46.310 --> 01:43:46.320 align:start position:0%
want to say also that i can't imagine
 
01:43:47.910 --> 01:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
that i would be sitting here to give
 
01:43:50.070 --> 01:43:50.080 align:start position:0%
this testimony to you today as a woman
 
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
who actually had an abortion when i was
 
01:43:54.229 --> 01:43:54.239 align:start position:0%
in my early twenties and was pressured
 
01:43:57.030 --> 01:43:57.040 align:start position:0%
to do so under the circumstances but was
 
01:43:58.629 --> 01:43:58.639 align:start position:0%
not my choice
 
01:44:00.790 --> 01:44:00.800 align:start position:0%
so i will never know the potential of
 
01:44:03.430 --> 01:44:03.440 align:start position:0%
that human being that i lost
 
01:44:05.910 --> 01:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
and i didn't even know how deeply buried
 
01:44:07.590 --> 01:44:07.600 align:start position:0%
that was in me because i never talked
 
01:44:09.750 --> 01:44:09.760 align:start position:0%
about it and i can't imagine i'm telling
 
01:44:12.229 --> 01:44:12.239 align:start position:0%
you all about this now but i'm compelled
 
01:44:15.109 --> 01:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
to do that because the sanctity and the
 
01:44:19.189 --> 01:44:19.199 align:start position:0%
value of human life that i lost i found
 
01:44:21.830 --> 01:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
in living in relationship with jeff
 
01:44:23.830 --> 01:44:23.840 align:start position:0%
and serving him so i just it's both of
 
01:44:25.910 --> 01:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
our testimonies combined
 
01:44:28.390 --> 01:44:28.400 align:start position:0%

01:45:16.629 --> 01:45:16.639 align:start position:0%
morning
 
01:45:18.390 --> 01:45:18.400 align:start position:0%
my name is sarah marku
 
01:45:20.709 --> 01:45:20.719 align:start position:0%
i live in northfield and i oppose this
 
01:45:20.719 --> 01:45:21.990 align:start position:0%
i live in northfield and i oppose this
bill

01:45:21.990 --> 01:45:22.000 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:45:23.910 --> 01:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
when i was 24 weeks pregnant with my
 
01:45:25.590 --> 01:45:25.600 align:start position:0%
daughter samantha
 
01:45:27.750 --> 01:45:27.760 align:start position:0%
i was sent in for genetic testing
 
01:45:29.430 --> 01:45:29.440 align:start position:0%
because of abnormalities that were found
 
01:45:31.189 --> 01:45:31.199 align:start position:0%
in her ultrasound
 
01:45:32.310 --> 01:45:32.320 align:start position:0%
they determined that she had
 
01:45:32.320 --> 01:45:33.830 align:start position:0%
they determined that she had
microcephaly

01:45:33.830 --> 01:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
microcephaly
 
01:45:36.470 --> 01:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
a host of genetic diseases a hole in her
 
01:45:36.480 --> 01:45:37.510 align:start position:0%
a host of genetic diseases a hole in her
heart

01:45:37.510 --> 01:45:37.520 align:start position:0%
heart
 
01:45:39.430 --> 01:45:39.440 align:start position:0%
and they said that if she survived being
 
01:45:41.270 --> 01:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
born at all that she would never walk or
 
01:45:41.280 --> 01:45:42.790 align:start position:0%
born at all that she would never walk or
talk

01:45:42.790 --> 01:45:42.800 align:start position:0%
talk
 
01:45:44.470 --> 01:45:44.480 align:start position:0%
we were told that the only humane thing
 
01:45:46.390 --> 01:45:46.400 align:start position:0%
to do would be to abort her
 
01:45:48.950 --> 01:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
humane as if she was an animal
 
01:45:50.550 --> 01:45:50.560 align:start position:0%
i declined and another doctor
 
01:45:52.629 --> 01:45:52.639 align:start position:0%
immediately came into the room to
 
01:45:55.189 --> 01:45:55.199 align:start position:0%
express how imperative it was that i
 
01:45:57.990 --> 01:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
take care of this her exact words
 
01:45:58.000 --> 01:45:59.030 align:start position:0%
take care of this her exact words
because

01:45:59.030 --> 01:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:46:01.830 --> 01:46:01.840 align:start position:0%
i was 24 weeks pregnant and at 25 they
 
01:46:03.910 --> 01:46:03.920 align:start position:0%
would be required to resuscitate her and
 
01:46:05.750 --> 01:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
at that point the choice would be too
 
01:46:05.760 --> 01:46:07.510 align:start position:0%
at that point the choice would be too
late

01:46:07.510 --> 01:46:07.520 align:start position:0%
late
 
01:46:09.109 --> 01:46:09.119 align:start position:0%
again i declined
 
01:46:11.030 --> 01:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
it was never a choice for me because i'm
 
01:46:13.830 --> 01:46:13.840 align:start position:0%
a firm believer in the sanctity of life
 
01:46:15.590 --> 01:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
but i've often wondered about those who
 
01:46:15.600 --> 01:46:16.870 align:start position:0%
but i've often wondered about those who
waver

01:46:16.870 --> 01:46:16.880 align:start position:0%
waver
 
01:46:18.709 --> 01:46:18.719 align:start position:0%
those who don't have a strong moral
 
01:46:20.149 --> 01:46:20.159 align:start position:0%
compass or those who are just plain
 
01:46:21.910 --> 01:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
scared and confused
 
01:46:23.510 --> 01:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
you see i also know what it's like to be
 
01:46:24.709 --> 01:46:24.719 align:start position:0%
a teenager
 
01:46:26.390 --> 01:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
and find out that there's a baby on the
 
01:46:26.400 --> 01:46:27.990 align:start position:0%
and find out that there's a baby on the
way

01:46:27.990 --> 01:46:28.000 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:46:29.669 --> 01:46:29.679 align:start position:0%
had i given in to the pressure because
 
01:46:31.830 --> 01:46:31.840 align:start position:0%
of my age i would have robbed this world
 
01:46:33.830 --> 01:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
of an amazing young man
 
01:46:35.510 --> 01:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
and later if i'd given in to the
 
01:46:37.669 --> 01:46:37.679 align:start position:0%
pressure of those in the medical field
 
01:46:39.430 --> 01:46:39.440 align:start position:0%
who were so insistent
 
01:46:41.030 --> 01:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
the world would miss an incredible young
 
01:46:41.040 --> 01:46:42.629 align:start position:0%
the world would miss an incredible young
woman

01:46:42.629 --> 01:46:42.639 align:start position:0%
woman
 
01:46:44.229 --> 01:46:44.239 align:start position:0%
if you take the time to listen to your
 
01:46:46.550 --> 01:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
constituents there is a moral outcry
 
01:46:48.070 --> 01:46:48.080 align:start position:0%
from the people that is being drowned
 
01:46:49.990 --> 01:46:50.000 align:start position:0%
out by corporations with an agenda and
 
01:46:51.350 --> 01:46:51.360 align:start position:0%
seemingly endless money to throw at
 
01:46:52.470 --> 01:46:52.480 align:start position:0%
their cause
 
01:46:53.750 --> 01:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
without even bringing into the
 
01:46:55.430 --> 01:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
discussion the lack of constitutional
 
01:46:57.990 --> 01:46:58.000 align:start position:0%
merit the massive human rights issue the
 
01:46:59.590 --> 01:46:59.600 align:start position:0%
emotional trauma that post-abortive
 
01:47:01.430 --> 01:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
family members live with or the physical
 
01:47:03.109 --> 01:47:03.119 align:start position:0%
trauma and increased cancer rates that
 
01:47:05.109 --> 01:47:05.119 align:start position:0%
post-abortive mothers face
 
01:47:06.870 --> 01:47:06.880 align:start position:0%
it's time to take every possible step
 
01:47:08.709 --> 01:47:08.719 align:start position:0%
toward halting abortion simply because
 
01:47:10.550 --> 01:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
it's the right thing to do
 
01:47:12.070 --> 01:47:12.080 align:start position:0%
if it means allowing an ultrasound
 
01:47:12.080 --> 01:47:13.430 align:start position:0%
if it means allowing an ultrasound
requirement

01:47:13.430 --> 01:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
01:47:16.390 --> 01:47:16.400 align:start position:0%
in this case then so be it
 
01:47:18.070 --> 01:47:18.080 align:start position:0%
it's time that we stop encouraging the
 
01:47:19.590 --> 01:47:19.600 align:start position:0%
slaughter of innocent people on the
 
01:47:21.430 --> 01:47:21.440 align:start position:0%
altar of convenience
 
01:47:23.270 --> 01:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
it's time to stop allowing doctors to
 
01:47:25.590 --> 01:47:25.600 align:start position:0%
push their own prejudices and ideas onto
 
01:47:27.910 --> 01:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
the very vulnerable patients at the
 
01:47:30.070 --> 01:47:30.080 align:start position:0%
expense of human life
 
01:47:34.629 --> 01:47:34.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:37.669 --> 01:47:37.679 align:start position:0%
my name is samantha marcou and i'm 17
 
01:47:39.830 --> 01:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
years old excuse me could you speak a
 
01:47:43.990 --> 01:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
little more closely into the mic
 
01:47:46.870 --> 01:47:46.880 align:start position:0%
my name is samantha marcou and i'm 17
 
01:47:48.149 --> 01:47:48.159 align:start position:0%
years old
 
01:47:50.790 --> 01:47:50.800 align:start position:0%
i'm from northfield new hampshire and i
 
01:47:53.510 --> 01:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill
 
01:47:55.590 --> 01:47:55.600 align:start position:0%
knowing i could have been aborted based
 
01:47:57.910 --> 01:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
off of a diagnosis that wasn't even
 
01:47:57.920 --> 01:47:58.950 align:start position:0%
off of a diagnosis that wasn't even
correct

01:47:58.950 --> 01:47:58.960 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:48:01.350 --> 01:48:01.360 align:start position:0%
makes it honestly surprising to me that
 
01:48:03.669 --> 01:48:03.679 align:start position:0%
i'm even standing here today
 
01:48:05.830 --> 01:48:05.840 align:start position:0%
especially considering the fact that so
 
01:48:09.189 --> 01:48:09.199 align:start position:0%
many others are not as lucky
 
01:48:11.510 --> 01:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
no medical test could say that i love
 
01:48:13.830 --> 01:48:13.840 align:start position:0%
reading and writing or show that i like
 
01:48:15.910 --> 01:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
doing puzzles
 
01:48:17.830 --> 01:48:17.840 align:start position:0%
no one could tell my family and my
 
01:48:20.390 --> 01:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
friends that i'm creative or that i like
 
01:48:20.400 --> 01:48:21.830 align:start position:0%
friends that i'm creative or that i like
agriculture

01:48:21.830 --> 01:48:21.840 align:start position:0%
agriculture
 
01:48:26.149 --> 01:48:26.159 align:start position:0%
they could not say who i am as a person
 
01:48:28.310 --> 01:48:28.320 align:start position:0%
everything i have ever done and ever
 
01:48:31.189 --> 01:48:31.199 align:start position:0%
will do i got the opportunity to do
 
01:48:33.750 --> 01:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
because i was not aborted
 
01:48:36.149 --> 01:48:36.159 align:start position:0%
that is an opportunity that everyone
 
01:48:38.390 --> 01:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
should have but unfortunately not
 
01:48:41.030 --> 01:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
everyone does
 
01:48:42.870 --> 01:48:42.880 align:start position:0%
if allowing mothers to see their
 
01:48:45.270 --> 01:48:45.280 align:start position:0%
children gives them that opportunity
 
01:48:47.830 --> 01:48:47.840 align:start position:0%
then shouldn't both mother and baby
 
01:48:49.830 --> 01:48:49.840 align:start position:0%
be allowed that
 
01:48:52.470 --> 01:48:52.480 align:start position:0%
the fetal protection act should stand as
 
01:48:52.480 --> 01:48:56.070 align:start position:0%
the fetal protection act should stand as
is

01:48:56.070 --> 01:48:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:58.950 --> 01:48:58.960 align:start position:0%
thank you so much appreciate that
 
01:49:05.990 --> 01:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:08.629 --> 01:49:08.639 align:start position:0%
representative folsom
 
01:49:09.990 --> 01:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
i'm going to make a statement but i'm
 
01:49:13.189 --> 01:49:13.199 align:start position:0%
going to say would you believe careful
 
01:49:16.070 --> 01:49:16.080 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for coming um
 
01:49:18.149 --> 01:49:18.159 align:start position:0%
and your personal testimony i really
 
01:49:20.470 --> 01:49:20.480 align:start position:0%
appreciate it it takes a lot
 
01:49:22.470 --> 01:49:22.480 align:start position:0%
uh to sit in that chair and you're
 
01:49:23.830 --> 01:49:23.840 align:start position:0%
probably the youngest one we've had
 
01:49:26.149 --> 01:49:26.159 align:start position:0%
today so thank you so much for coming
 
01:49:28.790 --> 01:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
and doing that i believe that
 
01:49:30.470 --> 01:49:30.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:49:32.629 --> 01:49:32.639 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes
 
01:49:52.950 --> 01:49:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:54.470 --> 01:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chair and members of the
 
01:49:57.510 --> 01:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
committee can you hear me all right
 
01:49:59.830 --> 01:49:59.840 align:start position:0%
ian hewitt on behalf of cornerstone i'd
 
01:50:01.830 --> 01:50:01.840 align:start position:0%
like to first say something about this
 
01:50:03.910 --> 01:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
bill which we oppose and then to say
 
01:50:06.070 --> 01:50:06.080 align:start position:0%
something about the amendment introduced
 
01:50:07.830 --> 01:50:07.840 align:start position:0%
by representative beth folsom which we
 
01:50:09.589 --> 01:50:09.599 align:start position:0%
strongly support
 
01:50:11.510 --> 01:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
first of all this bill
 
01:50:13.830 --> 01:50:13.840 align:start position:0%
has been over complicated and is much
 
01:50:15.669 --> 01:50:15.679 align:start position:0%
simpler than it seems
 
01:50:18.229 --> 01:50:18.239 align:start position:0%
it purports to introduce a variety of
 
01:50:20.470 --> 01:50:20.480 align:start position:0%
changes but most of those changes have
 
01:50:23.350 --> 01:50:23.360 align:start position:0%
no actual content or function
 
01:50:25.350 --> 01:50:25.360 align:start position:0%
fundamentally this bill does one thing
 
01:50:28.070 --> 01:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
which is to entirely nullify our current
 
01:50:30.550 --> 01:50:30.560 align:start position:0%
law and it does that actually in either
 
01:50:32.790 --> 01:50:32.800 align:start position:0%
of two ways but i'll just focus on one
 
01:50:34.870 --> 01:50:34.880 align:start position:0%
which is that it completely removes the
 
01:50:36.550 --> 01:50:36.560 align:start position:0%
ultrasound requirement
 
01:50:38.950 --> 01:50:38.960 align:start position:0%
now our law uses a numerical line to
 
01:50:42.310 --> 01:50:42.320 align:start position:0%
prohibit abortion 24 weeks or six months
 
01:50:43.830 --> 01:50:43.840 align:start position:0%
and as you heard from representative
 
01:50:45.990 --> 01:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
love when you have an enforceable
 
01:50:48.470 --> 01:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
numerical line you need a compulsory
 
01:50:50.950 --> 01:50:50.960 align:start position:0%
numerical measurement to use the example
 
01:50:52.790 --> 01:50:52.800 align:start position:0%
representative love gave if the speed
 
01:50:55.669 --> 01:50:55.679 align:start position:0%
limit is 65 miles per hour that's only
 
01:50:57.430 --> 01:50:57.440 align:start position:0%
enforceable because you're subject to
 
01:50:59.189 --> 01:50:59.199 align:start position:0%
the compulsory measurement of being
 
01:51:01.430 --> 01:51:01.440 align:start position:0%
clocked with a speed gun if anyone who
 
01:51:03.350 --> 01:51:03.360 align:start position:0%
wanted could opt out of being clocked
 
01:51:05.350 --> 01:51:05.360 align:start position:0%
with a speed gun we would in fact have
 
01:51:07.990 --> 01:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
no speed limit whatever the sign said
 
01:51:10.149 --> 01:51:10.159 align:start position:0%
so in this case there's no reason for us
 
01:51:12.629 --> 01:51:12.639 align:start position:0%
to debate about whether we need to add a
 
01:51:14.629 --> 01:51:14.639 align:start position:0%
rape exception when you've known that
 
01:51:16.390 --> 01:51:16.400 align:start position:0%
you're pregnant for four months because
 
01:51:18.149 --> 01:51:18.159 align:start position:0%
the fact is that whether or not any of
 
01:51:20.870 --> 01:51:20.880 align:start position:0%
these exceptions apply the bill causes
 
01:51:23.109 --> 01:51:23.119 align:start position:0%
the law to have no effect and to be
 
01:51:25.669 --> 01:51:25.679 align:start position:0%
unenforceable in every situation
 
01:51:27.270 --> 01:51:27.280 align:start position:0%
secondly we strongly support
 
01:51:28.870 --> 01:51:28.880 align:start position:0%
representative folsom's proposed
 
01:51:28.880 --> 01:51:29.910 align:start position:0%
representative folsom's proposed
amendment

01:51:29.910 --> 01:51:29.920 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:51:31.750 --> 01:51:31.760 align:start position:0%
because it will help to protect the
 
01:51:34.229 --> 01:51:34.239 align:start position:0%
fetal life protection act by further
 
01:51:37.189 --> 01:51:37.199 align:start position:0%
clarifying what the law already says
 
01:51:40.790 --> 01:51:40.800 align:start position:0%
rsa 329 46 already cabins the ultrasound
 
01:51:43.030 --> 01:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
requirement to situations where the
 
01:51:44.950 --> 01:51:44.960 align:start position:0%
abortion provider is conscious of a
 
01:51:47.189 --> 01:51:47.199 align:start position:0%
substantial risk that the fetus is 24
 
01:51:49.589 --> 01:51:49.599 align:start position:0%
weeks gestational age or older or six
 
01:51:51.589 --> 01:51:51.599 align:start position:0%
months a representative folsom has
 
01:51:53.750 --> 01:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
proposed to simply take this language
 
01:51:56.390 --> 01:51:56.400 align:start position:0%
and add it to the end of 44 1.
 
01:51:58.310 --> 01:51:58.320 align:start position:0%
so those who support the law as written
 
01:51:59.990 --> 01:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
should support the folsom amendment
 
01:52:02.149 --> 01:52:02.159 align:start position:0%
because it simply uses language already
 
01:52:04.390 --> 01:52:04.400 align:start position:0%
present in the law and it will remove
 
01:52:07.109 --> 01:52:07.119 align:start position:0%
the ability of opponents to quote 44 1
 
01:52:08.709 --> 01:52:08.719 align:start position:0%
out of context
 
01:52:11.830 --> 01:52:11.840 align:start position:0%
and moreover if there is any legislator
 
01:52:14.229 --> 01:52:14.239 align:start position:0%
who is open to the idea of a late term
 
01:52:17.189 --> 01:52:17.199 align:start position:0%
abortion ban but is simply in good faith
 
01:52:18.709 --> 01:52:18.719 align:start position:0%
concerned that the ultrasound
 
01:52:20.790 --> 01:52:20.800 align:start position:0%
requirement here is too onerous
 
01:52:22.229 --> 01:52:22.239 align:start position:0%
representative folsom's proposed
 
01:52:24.149 --> 01:52:24.159 align:start position:0%
amendment should more than address those
 
01:52:24.159 --> 01:52:25.430 align:start position:0%
amendment should more than address those
concerns

01:52:25.430 --> 01:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
01:52:27.109 --> 01:52:27.119 align:start position:0%
however we think that representative
 
01:52:29.189 --> 01:52:29.199 align:start position:0%
folsom's amendment will likely be
 
01:52:31.669 --> 01:52:31.679 align:start position:0%
revealing in that even if it is enacted
 
01:52:33.990 --> 01:52:34.000 align:start position:0%
into law many of the same people will
 
01:52:35.990 --> 01:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
still in all likelihood be attempting to
 
01:52:38.470 --> 01:52:38.480 align:start position:0%
repeal or gut the law and we'd submit
 
01:52:40.310 --> 01:52:40.320 align:start position:0%
that's because this debate is not really
 
01:52:42.870 --> 01:52:42.880 align:start position:0%
about ultrasounds or any particular
 
01:52:45.109 --> 01:52:45.119 align:start position:0%
exception but about a multi-million
 
01:52:47.430 --> 01:52:47.440 align:start position:0%
dollar lobby and its desire to maintain
 
01:52:49.589 --> 01:52:49.599 align:start position:0%
unlimited abortion up to birth
 
01:52:51.589 --> 01:52:51.599 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to entertain any questions
 
01:52:53.830 --> 01:52:53.840 align:start position:0%
about my testimony or any legal
 
01:52:56.229 --> 01:52:56.239 align:start position:0%
questions about the law of the bill
 
01:52:57.669 --> 01:52:57.679 align:start position:0%
representative folsom's proposed
 
01:53:00.709 --> 01:53:00.719 align:start position:0%
amendment or indeed massachusetts law
 
01:53:02.709 --> 01:53:02.719 align:start position:0%
well we can't look at representative
 
01:53:06.070 --> 01:53:06.080 align:start position:0%
folsom's amendment just yet but we will
 
01:53:08.950 --> 01:53:08.960 align:start position:0%
i may have misheard you i thought i
 
01:53:13.030 --> 01:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:16.709 --> 01:53:16.719 align:start position:0%
to this uh pregnant up to four months
 
01:53:19.510 --> 01:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't 24 weeks be six months
 
01:53:21.510 --> 01:53:21.520 align:start position:0%
the reason i mentioned four months is
 
01:53:21.520 --> 01:53:23.109 align:start position:0%
the reason i mentioned four months is
because

01:53:23.109 --> 01:53:23.119 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:53:25.510 --> 01:53:25.520 align:start position:0%
a woman in all likelihood has known uh
 
01:53:27.430 --> 01:53:27.440 align:start position:0%
if she's been raped that she's been
 
01:53:29.990 --> 01:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
pregnant for at least four months
 
01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:30.950 align:start position:0%
pregnant for at least four months
so

01:53:30.950 --> 01:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:53:33.430 --> 01:53:33.440 align:start position:0%
extremely all of the data that i've been
 
01:53:35.910 --> 01:53:35.920 align:start position:0%
able to find in published uh you know
 
01:53:37.430 --> 01:53:37.440 align:start position:0%
peer-reviewed medical journals shows
 
01:53:39.910 --> 01:53:39.920 align:start position:0%
that extremely late pregnancy awareness
 
01:53:41.270 --> 01:53:41.280 align:start position:0%
is 10 weeks
 
01:53:43.189 --> 01:53:43.199 align:start position:0%
so if you were on the extreme end of the
 
01:53:44.790 --> 01:53:44.800 align:start position:0%
curve in terms of pregnancy awareness
 
01:53:46.390 --> 01:53:46.400 align:start position:0%
you would have three and a half months
 
01:53:47.990 --> 01:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
to obtain an abortion before the
 
01:53:50.229 --> 01:53:50.239 align:start position:0%
six-month limit kicks in i appreciate
 
01:53:52.149 --> 01:53:52.159 align:start position:0%
that thank you i get it now any
 
01:53:52.159 --> 01:53:53.430 align:start position:0%
that thank you i get it now any
questions

01:53:53.430 --> 01:53:53.440 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:53:55.910 --> 01:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
uh representative folsom
 
01:53:58.550 --> 01:53:58.560 align:start position:0%
uh yes um thank you thank you mr chair
 
01:54:01.109 --> 01:54:01.119 align:start position:0%
and thank you um ian for taking our our
 
01:54:01.119 --> 01:54:02.470 align:start position:0%
and thank you um ian for taking our our
questions

01:54:02.470 --> 01:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:54:05.350 --> 01:54:05.360 align:start position:0%
could you clarify what was asked before
 
01:54:10.550 --> 01:54:10.560 align:start position:0%
about the massachusetts law um and
 
01:54:14.390 --> 01:54:14.400 align:start position:0%
i certainly could um the response from
 
01:54:14.400 --> 01:54:15.350 align:start position:0%
i certainly could um the response from
the

01:54:15.350 --> 01:54:15.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:54:17.270 --> 01:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
person who uh representative cushman
 
01:54:18.950 --> 01:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
asked the question of was was quite
 
01:54:21.910 --> 01:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
correct as to massachusetts current law
 
01:54:24.229 --> 01:54:24.239 align:start position:0%
massachusetts current law contains many
 
01:54:26.149 --> 01:54:26.159 align:start position:0%
exceptions that ours does not indeed it
 
01:54:28.629 --> 01:54:28.639 align:start position:0%
contains so many exceptions that
 
01:54:30.950 --> 01:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
abortion is legal for any reason at any
 
01:54:33.430 --> 01:54:33.440 align:start position:0%
time in massachusetts and there are no
 
01:54:35.990 --> 01:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
criminal penalties in massachusetts law
 
01:54:38.229 --> 01:54:38.239 align:start position:0%
however this only became the case in
 
01:54:41.510 --> 01:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
december of 2020. in december of 2020
 
01:54:43.109 --> 01:54:43.119 align:start position:0%
massachusetts passed something called
 
01:54:45.350 --> 01:54:45.360 align:start position:0%
the roe act when you cash it out
 
01:54:46.790 --> 01:54:46.800 align:start position:0%
effectively what it says is that
 
01:54:49.350 --> 01:54:49.360 align:start position:0%
abortion's legal for any reason up to 24
 
01:54:51.910 --> 01:54:51.920 align:start position:0%
weeks and after 24 weeks abortion's
 
01:54:53.910 --> 01:54:53.920 align:start position:0%
legal only if the woman and her doctor
 
01:54:56.070 --> 01:54:56.080 align:start position:0%
so choose so they've maintained a
 
01:54:58.950 --> 01:54:58.960 align:start position:0%
nominal 24 week limit while legalizing
 
01:55:00.870 --> 01:55:00.880 align:start position:0%
abortion up to birth for any reason and
 
01:55:01.990 --> 01:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
they've stripped out the criminal
 
01:55:03.589 --> 01:55:03.599 align:start position:0%
penalties section and replaced them with
 
01:55:03.599 --> 01:55:04.550 align:start position:0%
penalties section and replaced them with
nothing

01:55:04.550 --> 01:55:04.560 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
01:55:06.390 --> 01:55:06.400 align:start position:0%
however as representative cushman
 
01:55:09.109 --> 01:55:09.119 align:start position:0%
correctly pointed out prior to december
 
01:55:12.310 --> 01:55:12.320 align:start position:0%
of 2020 massachusetts had a felony
 
01:55:14.310 --> 01:55:14.320 align:start position:0%
six-month abortion ban
 
01:55:16.790 --> 01:55:16.800 align:start position:0%
and it did not have broad open-ended
 
01:55:18.709 --> 01:55:18.719 align:start position:0%
exceptions indeed it had no fetal
 
01:55:20.870 --> 01:55:20.880 align:start position:0%
anomalies exception
 
01:55:22.470 --> 01:55:22.480 align:start position:0%
and i think the relevance to
 
01:55:23.910 --> 01:55:23.920 align:start position:0%
representative cushman's question is
 
01:55:25.990 --> 01:55:26.000 align:start position:0%
that massachusetts has for many years
 
01:55:28.149 --> 01:55:28.159 align:start position:0%
been ranked as having the best or the
 
01:55:30.629 --> 01:55:30.639 align:start position:0%
second best medical care in the country
 
01:55:32.870 --> 01:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
so evidently physicians were not fleeing
 
01:55:34.790 --> 01:55:34.800 align:start position:0%
in terror from massachusetts when it had
 
01:55:37.030 --> 01:55:37.040 align:start position:0%
a felony six-month abortion ban there's
 
01:55:38.870 --> 01:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
no reason to expect physicians to flee
 
01:55:43.589 --> 01:55:43.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:43.599 --> 01:55:44.830 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:55:44.830 --> 01:55:44.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:55:47.990 --> 01:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
shapiro thank you mr chairman and thank
 
01:55:50.470 --> 01:55:50.480 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
 
01:55:53.030 --> 01:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
can i be heard i can hear you okay thank
 
01:55:53.040 --> 01:55:53.910 align:start position:0%
can i be heard i can hear you okay thank
you

01:55:53.910 --> 01:55:53.920 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:55:53.920 --> 01:55:57.189 align:start position:0%
you
um

01:55:57.189 --> 01:55:57.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:00.870 --> 01:56:00.880 align:start position:0%
yes in your testimony you seem to be
 
01:56:02.390 --> 01:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
very much in favor of the fetal
 
01:56:06.070 --> 01:56:06.080 align:start position:0%
protection act as well as the
 
01:56:08.709 --> 01:56:08.719 align:start position:0%
similar bill in massachusetts
 
01:56:11.430 --> 01:56:11.440 align:start position:0%
so i'm wondering if
 
01:56:14.550 --> 01:56:14.560 align:start position:0%
you and your organization
 
01:56:15.669 --> 01:56:15.679 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:56:15.679 --> 01:56:16.790 align:start position:0%
would be
against

01:56:16.790 --> 01:56:16.800 align:start position:0%
against
 
01:56:19.589 --> 01:56:19.599 align:start position:0%
further limiting abortion to an earlier
 
01:56:22.790 --> 01:56:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:24.629 --> 01:56:24.639 align:start position:0%
when you say bill in massachusetts just
 
01:56:26.149 --> 01:56:26.159 align:start position:0%
to clarify i take it you're talking
 
01:56:27.109 --> 01:56:27.119 align:start position:0%
about the
 
01:56:29.109 --> 01:56:29.119 align:start position:0%
previous law in massachusetts before it
 
01:56:31.510 --> 01:56:31.520 align:start position:0%
was repealed in december of 2020 yes
 
01:56:32.629 --> 01:56:32.639 align:start position:0%
which is much better than what
 
01:56:35.109 --> 01:56:35.119 align:start position:0%
massachusetts has now certainly i'm a
 
01:56:37.030 --> 01:56:37.040 align:start position:0%
little uncomfortable with this as the
 
01:56:39.350 --> 01:56:39.360 align:start position:0%
chair because i am under the impression
 
01:56:42.070 --> 01:56:42.080 align:start position:0%
a committee hearing is to debate the
 
01:56:42.080 --> 01:56:43.030 align:start position:0%
a committee hearing is to debate the
bill

01:56:43.030 --> 01:56:43.040 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:56:46.390 --> 01:56:46.400 align:start position:0%
not the personal beliefs of one giving
 
01:56:49.350 --> 01:56:49.360 align:start position:0%
testimony on a related subject but not
 
01:56:51.350 --> 01:56:51.360 align:start position:0%
the bill itself
 
01:56:53.189 --> 01:56:53.199 align:start position:0%
with you with your leave mr chair i'd be
 
01:56:55.910 --> 01:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
happy to answer the question okay uh all
 
01:56:58.470 --> 01:56:58.480 align:start position:0%
right within cornerstone and and among
 
01:57:00.310 --> 01:57:00.320 align:start position:0%
our supporters i think people would give
 
01:57:02.149 --> 01:57:02.159 align:start position:0%
different answers to that question which
 
01:57:04.149 --> 01:57:04.159 align:start position:0%
is why i can't give you a single answer
 
01:57:06.149 --> 01:57:06.159 align:start position:0%
right now but what i can tell you is
 
01:57:08.310 --> 01:57:08.320 align:start position:0%
that we don't expect it's politically
 
01:57:11.030 --> 01:57:11.040 align:start position:0%
realistic in new hampshire to enact for
 
01:57:13.030 --> 01:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
example something like what we see in
 
01:57:15.589 --> 01:57:15.599 align:start position:0%
mississippi we think the debate in new
 
01:57:18.070 --> 01:57:18.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire in the foreseeable future is
 
01:57:19.990 --> 01:57:20.000 align:start position:0%
simply not going to be about whether we
 
01:57:22.629 --> 01:57:22.639 align:start position:0%
can enact a 15-week abortion limit for
 
01:57:22.639 --> 01:57:23.750 align:start position:0%
can enact a 15-week abortion limit for
example

01:57:23.750 --> 01:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
example
 
01:57:25.589 --> 01:57:25.599 align:start position:0%
the debate now and likely will
 
01:57:27.750 --> 01:57:27.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunately continue to be
 
01:57:29.910 --> 01:57:29.920 align:start position:0%
whether we should have any limitation on
 
01:57:32.070 --> 01:57:32.080 align:start position:0%
abortion whatsoever or allow abortion up
 
01:57:33.270 --> 01:57:33.280 align:start position:0%
to birth and so that's what we're
 
01:57:34.950 --> 01:57:34.960 align:start position:0%
weighing in on
 
01:57:36.629 --> 01:57:36.639 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i appreciate that
 
01:57:36.639 --> 01:57:38.149 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i appreciate that
answer

01:57:38.149 --> 01:57:38.159 align:start position:0%
answer
 
01:57:40.950 --> 01:57:40.960 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
01:57:43.589 --> 01:57:43.599 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
01:57:45.910 --> 01:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
representative cushman
 
01:57:48.149 --> 01:57:48.159 align:start position:0%
just quickly does the
 
01:57:50.629 --> 01:57:50.639 align:start position:0%
fetal protect fetal life protection act
 
01:57:53.510 --> 01:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
require transvaginal ultrasound
 
01:57:55.750 --> 01:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
no it certainly does not um i'm glad you
 
01:57:57.350 --> 01:57:57.360 align:start position:0%
got the name correct it is the fetal
 
01:57:59.510 --> 01:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
life protection act i think ols forgot
 
01:58:01.990 --> 01:58:02.000 align:start position:0%
that in this case but the term
 
01:58:04.310 --> 01:58:04.320 align:start position:0%
transvaginal ultrasound appears nowhere
 
01:58:05.990 --> 01:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
in the legislation it refers to an
 
01:58:07.669 --> 01:58:07.679 align:start position:0%
obstetric ultrasound which is just
 
01:58:08.950 --> 01:58:08.960 align:start position:0%
another way of referring to an
 
01:58:11.910 --> 01:58:11.920 align:start position:0%
ultrasound performed during pregnancy
 
01:58:15.030 --> 01:58:15.040 align:start position:0%
the law was intentionally framed in
 
01:58:16.790 --> 01:58:16.800 align:start position:0%
consultation with legal scholars around
 
01:58:19.990 --> 01:58:20.000 align:start position:0%
the country not to place any limitation
 
01:58:23.270 --> 01:58:23.280 align:start position:0%
on abortion substantially in advance of
 
01:58:26.229 --> 01:58:26.239 align:start position:0%
24 weeks had the law actually done that
 
01:58:27.910 --> 01:58:27.920 align:start position:0%
in all likelihood it already would have
 
01:58:30.149 --> 01:58:30.159 align:start position:0%
been challenged and probably enjoined by
 
01:58:32.310 --> 01:58:32.320 align:start position:0%
the first circuit court of appeals which
 
01:58:34.149 --> 01:58:34.159 align:start position:0%
has made its position clear on these
 
01:58:36.149 --> 01:58:36.159 align:start position:0%
sorts of of issues
 
01:58:38.149 --> 01:58:38.159 align:start position:0%
instead the law was framed so that under
 
01:58:40.229 --> 01:58:40.239 align:start position:0%
329 46
 
01:58:42.709 --> 01:58:42.719 align:start position:0%
these provisions only kick in if the
 
01:58:45.030 --> 01:58:45.040 align:start position:0%
abortion provider knows that the fetus
 
01:58:46.870 --> 01:58:46.880 align:start position:0%
has a gestational age of six months or
 
01:58:49.990 --> 01:58:50.000 align:start position:0%
more or is conscious of a substantial
 
01:58:51.830 --> 01:58:51.840 align:start position:0%
risk that the fetus has a gestational
 
01:58:53.750 --> 01:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
age of six months or more that's a very
 
01:58:55.589 --> 01:58:55.599 align:start position:0%
common legal test in the law known as
 
01:58:57.669 --> 01:58:57.679 align:start position:0%
recklessness it appears throughout our
 
01:58:59.910 --> 01:58:59.920 align:start position:0%
criminal code and in our civil law in
 
01:59:02.390 --> 01:59:02.400 align:start position:0%
new hampshire so it's easy for courts to
 
01:59:02.400 --> 01:59:03.430 align:start position:0%
new hampshire so it's easy for courts to
enforce

01:59:03.430 --> 01:59:03.440 align:start position:0%
enforce
 
01:59:05.350 --> 01:59:05.360 align:start position:0%
um representative folsom's amendment of
 
01:59:07.109 --> 01:59:07.119 align:start position:0%
course would take that limiting language
 
01:59:09.109 --> 01:59:09.119 align:start position:0%
and simply reiterate it once again at
 
01:59:10.870 --> 01:59:10.880 align:start position:0%
the end of 44.1
 
01:59:13.270 --> 01:59:13.280 align:start position:0%
making it even clearer and making it
 
01:59:15.589 --> 01:59:15.599 align:start position:0%
impossible for 44.1 to be quoted out of
 
01:59:15.599 --> 01:59:17.030 align:start position:0%
impossible for 44.1 to be quoted out of
context

01:59:17.030 --> 01:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
context
 
01:59:19.350 --> 01:59:19.360 align:start position:0%
and hopefully resolving the good faith
 
01:59:21.030 --> 01:59:21.040 align:start position:0%
concerns of any legislators who
 
01:59:22.709 --> 01:59:22.719 align:start position:0%
mistakenly believe that there is an
 
01:59:25.109 --> 01:59:25.119 align:start position:0%
onerous universal ultrasound requirement
 
01:59:26.870 --> 01:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
in this law
 
01:59:28.790 --> 01:59:28.800 align:start position:0%
any further questions representative
 
01:59:31.990 --> 01:59:32.000 align:start position:0%
folsom thank you mr chair thank you ian
 
01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:33.270 align:start position:0%
folsom thank you mr chair thank you ian
um

01:59:33.270 --> 01:59:33.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:35.030 --> 01:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
my other question has to do with
 
01:59:37.109 --> 01:59:37.119 align:start position:0%
something i had asked earlier of the
 
01:59:38.790 --> 01:59:38.800 align:start position:0%
doctor um
 
01:59:43.030 --> 01:59:43.040 align:start position:0%
with regards to is it safer for a woman
 
01:59:44.709 --> 01:59:44.719 align:start position:0%
uh the the
 
01:59:49.109 --> 01:59:49.119 align:start position:0%
the provider to perform the ultrasound
 
01:59:49.119 --> 01:59:49.990 align:start position:0%
the provider to perform the ultrasound
um

01:59:49.990 --> 01:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:52.310 --> 01:59:52.320 align:start position:0%
in reading several things i have read
 
01:59:54.870 --> 01:59:54.880 align:start position:0%
back and forth that oh it's it's
 
01:59:57.270 --> 01:59:57.280 align:start position:0%
standard care practice to do an
 
01:59:59.510 --> 01:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
ultrasound before
 
02:00:01.350 --> 02:00:01.360 align:start position:0%
an abortion and sometimes i've heard
 
02:00:03.830 --> 02:00:03.840 align:start position:0%
well sometimes yes sometimes no
 
02:00:07.830 --> 02:00:07.840 align:start position:0%
can you add any clarity to that
 
02:00:10.070 --> 02:00:10.080 align:start position:0%
well i can tell you we don't know what
 
02:00:12.550 --> 02:00:12.560 align:start position:0%
the standard procedure in new hampshire
 
02:00:15.830 --> 02:00:15.840 align:start position:0%
is and i can tell you that confidently
 
02:00:18.390 --> 02:00:18.400 align:start position:0%
because what we have heard from abortion
 
02:00:20.310 --> 02:00:20.320 align:start position:0%
clinics around the state has changed
 
02:00:22.390 --> 02:00:22.400 align:start position:0%
numerous times month to month and
 
02:00:24.550 --> 02:00:24.560 align:start position:0%
sometimes week to week
 
02:00:28.950 --> 02:00:28.960 align:start position:0%
as recently as june 22nd of last year
 
02:00:31.189 --> 02:00:31.199 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire public radio reported
 
02:00:33.030 --> 02:00:33.040 align:start position:0%
that they contacted multiple abortion
 
02:00:34.950 --> 02:00:34.960 align:start position:0%
clinics around the state and they
 
02:00:36.629 --> 02:00:36.639 align:start position:0%
reported after speaking to them that
 
02:00:38.550 --> 02:00:38.560 align:start position:0%
pre-abortion ultrasounds were already
 
02:00:40.790 --> 02:00:40.800 align:start position:0%
standard medical practice
 
02:00:44.070 --> 02:00:44.080 align:start position:0%
then later a week later june 28 the
 
02:00:46.310 --> 02:00:46.320 align:start position:0%
union leader did an article where they
 
02:00:48.149 --> 02:00:48.159 align:start position:0%
reported abortion clinics were telling
 
02:00:50.470 --> 02:00:50.480 align:start position:0%
them that pre-abortion ultrasounds are
 
02:00:52.470 --> 02:00:52.480 align:start position:0%
actually rare
 
02:00:55.270 --> 02:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
then december 16th i i heard something
 
02:00:57.669 --> 02:00:57.679 align:start position:0%
i'd never heard before and and was hurt
 
02:00:59.189 --> 02:00:59.199 align:start position:0%
hearing for the first time on december
 
02:01:01.669 --> 02:01:01.679 align:start position:0%
16th equality health center told the
 
02:01:04.470 --> 02:01:04.480 align:start position:0%
union leader that in fact for the past
 
02:01:07.350 --> 02:01:07.360 align:start position:0%
two years they've never done a single
 
02:01:10.390 --> 02:01:10.400 align:start position:0%
pre-abortion ultrasound so the story
 
02:01:12.870 --> 02:01:12.880 align:start position:0%
from abortion clinics has dramatically
 
02:01:15.589 --> 02:01:15.599 align:start position:0%
changed many times and i think as a
 
02:01:18.470 --> 02:01:18.480 align:start position:0%
result of that we have no clue
 
02:01:20.390 --> 02:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
what standard practice in new hampshire
 
02:01:23.030 --> 02:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
is with respect to abortion clinics
 
02:01:24.870 --> 02:01:24.880 align:start position:0%
we simply have to take their word for it
 
02:01:26.550 --> 02:01:26.560 align:start position:0%
and their word has changed a number of
 
02:01:26.560 --> 02:01:29.109 align:start position:0%
and their word has changed a number of
times

02:01:29.109 --> 02:01:29.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:31.350 --> 02:01:31.360 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
02:01:33.270 --> 02:01:33.280 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:01:35.109 --> 02:01:35.119 align:start position:0%
if you have written testimony we'd like
 
02:01:37.350 --> 02:01:37.360 align:start position:0%
to have it thank you mr chair i do not
 
02:01:39.430 --> 02:01:39.440 align:start position:0%
have a physical copy but i can provide
 
02:01:41.510 --> 02:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
electronics that would be a good idea
 
02:01:45.589 --> 02:01:45.599 align:start position:0%
and that's also to anyone else who
 
02:01:48.390 --> 02:01:48.400 align:start position:0%
has read off their phones
 
02:01:48.400 --> 02:01:49.270 align:start position:0%
has read off their phones
if

02:01:49.270 --> 02:01:49.280 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:01:50.950 --> 02:01:50.960 align:start position:0%
those people could
 
02:01:53.589 --> 02:01:53.599 align:start position:0%
provide the clerk eventually a written
 
02:01:53.599 --> 02:01:57.270 align:start position:0%
provide the clerk eventually a written
copy

02:01:57.270 --> 02:01:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:00.070 --> 02:02:00.080 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative timothy
 
02:02:00.080 --> 02:02:06.390 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative timothy
horrigan

02:02:06.390 --> 02:02:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:07.990 --> 02:02:08.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair i'm after
 
02:02:09.510 --> 02:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
timothy oregon from stratfor county
 
02:02:11.189 --> 02:02:11.199 align:start position:0%
district six the towns of durham and
 
02:02:11.199 --> 02:02:12.629 align:start position:0%
district six the towns of durham and
madbury

02:02:12.629 --> 02:02:12.639 align:start position:0%
madbury
 
02:02:15.270 --> 02:02:15.280 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to chime in on the narrow
 
02:02:16.870 --> 02:02:16.880 align:start position:0%
issue of the sentence about the
 
02:02:18.950 --> 02:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
obstetric ultrasound and of course the
 
02:02:18.960 --> 02:02:20.550 align:start position:0%
obstetric ultrasound and of course the
bill

02:02:20.550 --> 02:02:20.560 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:02:22.470 --> 02:02:22.480 align:start position:0%
as introduced actually strikes that
 
02:02:24.550 --> 02:02:24.560 align:start position:0%
sentence so that um
 
02:02:27.189 --> 02:02:27.199 align:start position:0%
so if you were to um if you're past that
 
02:02:28.870 --> 02:02:28.880 align:start position:0%
it would be uh
 
02:02:30.709 --> 02:02:30.719 align:start position:0%
that whole debate would be moved over
 
02:02:32.629 --> 02:02:32.639 align:start position:0%
whether or not it's a transgenic or
 
02:02:35.030 --> 02:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
ultrasound or what a trans vaginal
 
02:02:37.910 --> 02:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
ultrasound or regular one is or is not
 
02:02:37.920 --> 02:02:39.109 align:start position:0%
ultrasound or regular one is or is not
um

02:02:39.109 --> 02:02:39.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:41.109 --> 02:02:41.119 align:start position:0%
i've uh
 
02:02:43.189 --> 02:02:43.199 align:start position:0%
i miss what they call cis male so i
 
02:02:45.189 --> 02:02:45.199 align:start position:0%
would it wouldn't be physically possible
 
02:02:46.709 --> 02:02:46.719 align:start position:0%
for me to even have
 
02:02:47.990 --> 02:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
such an ultrasound i have had an
 
02:02:49.830 --> 02:02:49.840 align:start position:0%
external ultrasound and even that was a
 
02:02:52.070 --> 02:02:52.080 align:start position:0%
fairly uh you know difficult procedure
 
02:02:53.350 --> 02:02:53.360 align:start position:0%
it's fairly
 
02:02:54.950 --> 02:02:54.960 align:start position:0%
fairly expensive it's not something you
 
02:02:58.149 --> 02:02:58.159 align:start position:0%
want to make people
 
02:02:59.990 --> 02:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
it's not necessarily something to be
 
02:03:01.510 --> 02:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate to do in
 
02:03:01.520 --> 02:03:02.629 align:start position:0%
appropriate to do in
um

02:03:02.629 --> 02:03:02.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:05.030 --> 02:03:05.040 align:start position:0%
in a situation like uh counseling
 
02:03:07.510 --> 02:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
someone on a on an abortion and it was
 
02:03:07.520 --> 02:03:08.709 align:start position:0%
someone on a on an abortion and it was
uh

02:03:08.709 --> 02:03:08.719 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:03:11.030 --> 02:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
i was part of this we had a bill that
 
02:03:12.709 --> 02:03:12.719 align:start position:0%
came through judiciary committee which
 
02:03:14.790 --> 02:03:14.800 align:start position:0%
we uh adopted to
 
02:03:17.030 --> 02:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
actually just strike that one sentence
 
02:03:19.510 --> 02:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
from the bill and that
 
02:03:22.709 --> 02:03:22.719 align:start position:0%
almost made it to the floor there was uh
 
02:03:24.070 --> 02:03:24.080 align:start position:0%
the speaker ruled that it was a
 
02:03:26.390 --> 02:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
non-germane amendment and he
 
02:03:28.149 --> 02:03:28.159 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason he said he had just
 
02:03:29.750 --> 02:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
done a few days before even though he
 
02:03:31.750 --> 02:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
was actually
 
02:03:33.189 --> 02:03:33.199 align:start position:0%
in the room
 
02:03:35.350 --> 02:03:35.360 align:start position:0%
when we took the vote on the amendment
 
02:03:37.030 --> 02:03:37.040 align:start position:0%
um that the amendment had been
 
02:03:39.990 --> 02:03:40.000 align:start position:0%
publicized in every major media outlet
 
02:03:42.790 --> 02:03:42.800 align:start position:0%
in the state and
 
02:03:44.550 --> 02:03:44.560 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
02:03:46.310 --> 02:03:46.320 align:start position:0%
um and
 
02:03:48.550 --> 02:03:48.560 align:start position:0%
actually the cornerstone family research
 
02:03:51.270 --> 02:03:51.280 align:start position:0%
even used that in a uh several emails
 
02:03:53.109 --> 02:03:53.119 align:start position:0%
because they were
 
02:03:53.119 --> 02:03:54.310 align:start position:0%
because they were
basically

02:03:54.310 --> 02:03:54.320 align:start position:0%
basically
 
02:03:56.870 --> 02:03:56.880 align:start position:0%
urging the speaker to remove two
 
02:03:58.470 --> 02:03:58.480 align:start position:0%
republicans from the committee who had
 
02:03:59.990 --> 02:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
voted to delete the object which
 
02:04:01.589 --> 02:04:01.599 align:start position:0%
ultrasound so even mr hewitt's
 
02:04:03.669 --> 02:04:03.679 align:start position:0%
organization sent out
 
02:04:06.550 --> 02:04:06.560 align:start position:0%
emails uh saying that so it did seem odd
 
02:04:07.830 --> 02:04:07.840 align:start position:0%
that the speaker
 
02:04:09.510 --> 02:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
speaker must have known about the amount
 
02:04:11.669 --> 02:04:11.679 align:start position:0%
i would now uh say to the representative
 
02:04:14.550 --> 02:04:14.560 align:start position:0%
please confine it to this bill yes so
 
02:04:16.709 --> 02:04:16.719 align:start position:0%
that so i'm opposed to the bill in
 
02:04:19.109 --> 02:04:19.119 align:start position:0%
general but uh if you had a bill that
 
02:04:21.109 --> 02:04:21.119 align:start position:0%
just did that that would actually have
 
02:04:23.270 --> 02:04:23.280 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support if you did just
 
02:04:25.109 --> 02:04:25.119 align:start position:0%
strike the obstetric ultrasound thing
 
02:04:26.870 --> 02:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
because that's uh
 
02:04:28.950 --> 02:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
that's a very very questionable thing to
 
02:04:30.550 --> 02:04:30.560 align:start position:0%
make any woman go through especially in
 
02:04:32.069 --> 02:04:32.079 align:start position:0%
many cases uh
 
02:04:33.109 --> 02:04:33.119 align:start position:0%
women who
 
02:04:34.790 --> 02:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
are pregnant through
 
02:04:37.830 --> 02:04:37.840 align:start position:0%
rape or incest so like making uh even
 
02:04:39.270 --> 02:04:39.280 align:start position:0%
it's not clear whether or not they need
 
02:04:41.430 --> 02:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
the invasive ultrasound but if it
 
02:04:43.109 --> 02:04:43.119 align:start position:0%
certainly is invasive ultrasound that's
 
02:04:45.270 --> 02:04:45.280 align:start position:0%
something in many cases uh not
 
02:04:47.189 --> 02:04:47.199 align:start position:0%
not an appropriate procedure to force
 
02:04:49.270 --> 02:04:49.280 align:start position:0%
someone to have so thank you for your
 
02:04:51.910 --> 02:04:51.920 align:start position:0%
testimony will you take questions um i
 
02:04:53.510 --> 02:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
suppose i may not be able to answer them
 
02:04:55.030 --> 02:04:55.040 align:start position:0%
but that's all right yeah
 
02:04:56.870 --> 02:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes uh chair recognizes
 
02:04:59.189 --> 02:04:59.199 align:start position:0%
representative leon yeah thank you mr
 
02:05:00.550 --> 02:05:00.560 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you representative
 
02:05:03.350 --> 02:05:03.360 align:start position:0%
for taking the question um i'm curious
 
02:05:05.109 --> 02:05:05.119 align:start position:0%
about your statement that the speaker
 
02:05:07.270 --> 02:05:07.280 align:start position:0%
ruled on the germanness of the amendment
 
02:05:09.589 --> 02:05:09.599 align:start position:0%
um i i did not hear any ruling or see
 
02:05:12.149 --> 02:05:12.159 align:start position:0%
any ruling okay well i'm not sure i was
 
02:05:14.390 --> 02:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
already interrupted by the chairman not
 
02:05:16.870 --> 02:05:16.880 align:start position:0%
to my surprise but that was
 
02:05:19.189 --> 02:05:19.199 align:start position:0%
that was my understanding of the
 
02:05:21.430 --> 02:05:21.440 align:start position:0%
floor maneuvers that happened
 
02:05:23.030 --> 02:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
obviously those were two long days but
 
02:05:24.229 --> 02:05:24.239 align:start position:0%
that was
 
02:05:25.589 --> 02:05:25.599 align:start position:0%
that was what i thought i heard and
 
02:05:27.109 --> 02:05:27.119 align:start position:0%
anybody any of us can go back and look
 
02:05:28.550 --> 02:05:28.560 align:start position:0%
at the video to see what it was he
 
02:05:30.870 --> 02:05:30.880 align:start position:0%
actually said but um i
 
02:05:31.910 --> 02:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
that was
 
02:05:33.189 --> 02:05:33.199 align:start position:0%
that was my understanding of what
 
02:05:34.629 --> 02:05:34.639 align:start position:0%
happened and certainly uh with a
 
02:05:36.470 --> 02:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
bipartisan majority voted through a bill
 
02:05:39.750 --> 02:05:39.760 align:start position:0%
that um he refused to let us vote on
 
02:05:41.270 --> 02:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
but anyway
 
02:05:43.270 --> 02:05:43.280 align:start position:0%
that's that's zen this is now open
 
02:05:43.280 --> 02:05:45.910 align:start position:0%
that's that's zen this is now open
thanks

02:05:45.910 --> 02:05:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:47.669 --> 02:05:47.679 align:start position:0%

good morning mr chairman members of the
 
02:06:23.669 --> 02:06:23.679 align:start position:0%
committee um
 
02:06:27.910 --> 02:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
my name is catherine lacoste and um
 
02:06:31.270 --> 02:06:31.280 align:start position:0%
i am here to speak in opposition to
 
02:06:34.790 --> 02:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
house bill 1609
 
02:06:36.229 --> 02:06:36.239 align:start position:0%
i'm a wife
 
02:06:40.069 --> 02:06:40.079 align:start position:0%
a mother of three a grandmother of three
 
02:06:42.550 --> 02:06:42.560 align:start position:0%
i've been in health care for over 40
 
02:06:47.189 --> 02:06:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:50.870 --> 02:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
we have cheered and i am here on behalf
 
02:06:53.189 --> 02:06:53.199 align:start position:0%
of life
 
02:06:54.870 --> 02:06:54.880 align:start position:0%
we have
 
02:06:54.880 --> 02:06:57.589 align:start position:0%
we have
cheered

02:06:57.589 --> 02:06:57.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:00.790 --> 02:07:00.800 align:start position:0%
the scientific advances that research
 
02:07:02.950 --> 02:07:02.960 align:start position:0%
has provided
 
02:07:05.510 --> 02:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
why would we not want the benefit of an
 
02:07:07.510 --> 02:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
ultrasound there's been a lot of talk
 
02:07:10.709 --> 02:07:10.719 align:start position:0%
about ultrasounds today as being very
 
02:07:14.229 --> 02:07:14.239 align:start position:0%
invasive which some may be but i think
 
02:07:18.310 --> 02:07:18.320 align:start position:0%
in the context of this not so much
 
02:07:20.709 --> 02:07:20.719 align:start position:0%
the only thing that i can come up with
 
02:07:22.229 --> 02:07:22.239 align:start position:0%
is that
 
02:07:24.550 --> 02:07:24.560 align:start position:0%
what we find is that
 
02:07:27.669 --> 02:07:27.679 align:start position:0%
women who are contemplating abortion
 
02:07:29.990 --> 02:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
once they have had an ultrasound
 
02:07:32.149 --> 02:07:32.159 align:start position:0%
often choose life
 
02:07:33.750 --> 02:07:33.760 align:start position:0%
and i think that that's something that
 
02:07:36.709 --> 02:07:36.719 align:start position:0%
you need to keep in mind
 
02:07:40.629 --> 02:07:40.639 align:start position:0%
in my work i have seen
 
02:07:43.990 --> 02:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
people at their best and at their worst
 
02:07:45.430 --> 02:07:45.440 align:start position:0%
i've worked in
 
02:07:48.629 --> 02:07:48.639 align:start position:0%
critical care i've given anesthesia i've
 
02:07:51.189 --> 02:07:51.199 align:start position:0%
done pretty much everything with the
 
02:07:52.709 --> 02:07:52.719 align:start position:0%
exception of
 
02:07:55.270 --> 02:07:55.280 align:start position:0%
pediatrics and psych although when you
 
02:07:57.270 --> 02:07:57.280 align:start position:0%
work in the emergency room you do a lot
 
02:08:00.340 --> 02:08:00.350 align:start position:0%
of psych then too
 
02:08:00.350 --> 02:08:02.629 align:start position:0%
of psych then too
[Music]

02:08:02.629 --> 02:08:02.639 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:08:02.639 --> 02:08:05.109 align:start position:0%
[Music]
so

02:08:05.109 --> 02:08:05.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:08.390 --> 02:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
i've seen the devastation of poor
 
02:08:11.030 --> 02:08:11.040 align:start position:0%
choices we all want to talk about choice
 
02:08:12.629 --> 02:08:12.639 align:start position:0%
versus life
 
02:08:14.950 --> 02:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
and i've seen the devastation of poor
 
02:08:17.910 --> 02:08:17.920 align:start position:0%
choices from addiction to suicide and
 
02:08:17.920 --> 02:08:19.750 align:start position:0%
choices from addiction to suicide and
depression

02:08:19.750 --> 02:08:19.760 align:start position:0%
depression
 
02:08:22.629 --> 02:08:22.639 align:start position:0%
and i've also seen the true blessings of
 
02:08:25.990 --> 02:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:28.629 --> 02:08:28.639 align:start position:0%
the fetal life protection act
 
02:08:31.510 --> 02:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
that has been discussed today
 
02:08:35.270 --> 02:08:35.280 align:start position:0%
and what is going to be corrected
 
02:08:37.990 --> 02:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
by this bill
 
02:08:40.310 --> 02:08:40.320 align:start position:0%
we can all agree that rape
 
02:08:43.030 --> 02:08:43.040 align:start position:0%
is a horrific act
 
02:08:45.350 --> 02:08:45.360 align:start position:0%
abortion doesn't fix
 
02:08:48.069 --> 02:08:48.079 align:start position:0%
the violation
 
02:08:51.109 --> 02:08:51.119 align:start position:0%
but adds a further victimization to two
 
02:08:51.119 --> 02:08:52.950 align:start position:0%
but adds a further victimization to two
people

02:08:52.950 --> 02:08:52.960 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:08:56.629 --> 02:08:56.639 align:start position:0%
and in closing i would just like to say
 
02:08:56.639 --> 02:08:57.510 align:start position:0%
and in closing i would just like to say
do

02:08:57.510 --> 02:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
do
 
02:08:58.629 --> 02:08:58.639 align:start position:0%

i during my years on active duty in the
 
02:10:03.990 --> 02:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
army i was the quality improvement
 
02:10:05.750 --> 02:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
officer for the anesthesia department
 
02:10:07.669 --> 02:10:07.679 align:start position:0%
for an army medical center
 
02:10:10.229 --> 02:10:10.239 align:start position:0%
and for a general a general hospital
 
02:10:12.390 --> 02:10:12.400 align:start position:0%
army general hospital
 
02:10:15.350 --> 02:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
during my years doing anesthesia i did
 
02:10:17.189 --> 02:10:17.199 align:start position:0%
roughly two to three hundred obstetric
 
02:10:17.199 --> 02:10:18.229 align:start position:0%
roughly two to three hundred obstetric
cases

02:10:18.229 --> 02:10:18.239 align:start position:0%
cases
 
02:10:20.390 --> 02:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
i did approximately
 
02:10:24.950 --> 02:10:24.960 align:start position:0%
i guesstimate 1 000 to 2 000 gyn cases
 
02:10:26.870 --> 02:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
i did a total of
 
02:10:31.430 --> 02:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
15 to 30 000 total anesthetics
 
02:10:34.229 --> 02:10:34.239 align:start position:0%
during the course of my practice i never
 
02:10:35.589 --> 02:10:35.599 align:start position:0%
heard once
 
02:10:37.830 --> 02:10:37.840 align:start position:0%
anybody dispute the fact that life
 
02:10:41.109 --> 02:10:41.119 align:start position:0%
begins at conception
 
02:10:44.149 --> 02:10:44.159 align:start position:0%
the sperm fertilizes the egg
 
02:10:47.990 --> 02:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
and at that fertilization that egg
 
02:10:51.270 --> 02:10:51.280 align:start position:0%
or that zygote has all the dna
 
02:10:52.950 --> 02:10:52.960 align:start position:0%
that each and every one of us has in
 
02:10:56.149 --> 02:10:56.159 align:start position:0%
this room as we mature through our
 
02:10:57.830 --> 02:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
gestation period
 
02:10:59.430 --> 02:10:59.440 align:start position:0%
to birth
 
02:11:00.629 --> 02:11:00.639 align:start position:0%
to life
 
02:11:00.639 --> 02:11:01.350 align:start position:0%
to life
as

02:11:01.350 --> 02:11:01.360 align:start position:0%
as
 
02:11:04.229 --> 02:11:04.239 align:start position:0%
as functioning human needs outside of
 
02:11:09.510 --> 02:11:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:11.189 --> 02:11:11.199 align:start position:0%
two years ago my wife and i had the
 
02:11:13.669 --> 02:11:13.679 align:start position:0%
opportunity to attend the march for life
 
02:11:16.390 --> 02:11:16.400 align:start position:0%
and as we walked down the street
 
02:11:18.790 --> 02:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
thousands and thousands of people there
 
02:11:20.629 --> 02:11:20.639 align:start position:0%
were many posters on the side of the
 
02:11:23.270 --> 02:11:23.280 align:start position:0%
road this is my child
 
02:11:25.910 --> 02:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
he's disabled she's disabled i'm very
 
02:11:31.510 --> 02:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:34.709 --> 02:11:34.719 align:start position:0%
on a personal note i had prostate cancer
 
02:11:37.350 --> 02:11:37.360 align:start position:0%
four and a half years ago and i had to
 
02:11:39.350 --> 02:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
undergo an invasive
 
02:11:42.470 --> 02:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
ultrasound for the diagnosis
 
02:11:45.030 --> 02:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
it was very uncomfortable i can
 
02:11:46.950 --> 02:11:46.960 align:start position:0%
appreciate what a young woman would have
 
02:11:49.669 --> 02:11:49.679 align:start position:0%
to go through for an ultrasound
 
02:11:52.310 --> 02:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
a vaginal ultrasound
 
02:11:54.149 --> 02:11:54.159 align:start position:0%
i'm sure it's very uncomfortable and
 
02:11:57.589 --> 02:11:57.599 align:start position:0%
traumatic in the state of her
 
02:12:00.390 --> 02:12:00.400 align:start position:0%
early pregnancy um
 
02:12:02.629 --> 02:12:02.639 align:start position:0%
i would refer you each and every one of
 
02:12:03.990 --> 02:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
you to the
 
02:12:06.950 --> 02:12:06.960 align:start position:0%
writings of bernard nathan nathanson
 
02:12:09.750 --> 02:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
he's uh he's deceased now
 
02:12:12.550 --> 02:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
he was an abortionist he
 
02:12:13.669 --> 02:12:13.679 align:start position:0%
said he did
 
02:12:16.390 --> 02:12:16.400 align:start position:0%
around ten thousand abortions
 
02:12:18.149 --> 02:12:18.159 align:start position:0%
and when uh
 
02:12:20.390 --> 02:12:20.400 align:start position:0%
ultrasounds became available
 
02:12:21.830 --> 02:12:21.840 align:start position:0%
he quit
 
02:12:23.990 --> 02:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
when he saw the reaction
 
02:12:25.189 --> 02:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
to the
 
02:12:25.199 --> 02:12:26.870 align:start position:0%
to the
fetus

02:12:26.870 --> 02:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
fetus
 
02:12:29.510 --> 02:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
to the probe but the uh
 
02:12:31.510 --> 02:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
ultrasound attacking
 
02:12:33.270 --> 02:12:33.280 align:start position:0%
on a personal note
 
02:12:35.430 --> 02:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
before my wife and i were married
 
02:12:39.350 --> 02:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:41.830 --> 02:12:41.840 align:start position:0%
after six years my wife and i separated
 
02:12:43.589 --> 02:12:43.599 align:start position:0%
we continued to date after the
 
02:12:43.599 --> 02:12:45.350 align:start position:0%
we continued to date after the
separation

02:12:45.350 --> 02:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
separation
 
02:12:46.830 --> 02:12:46.840 align:start position:0%
she became
 
02:12:49.669 --> 02:12:49.679 align:start position:0%
pregnant she called me told me she was
 
02:12:51.189 --> 02:12:51.199 align:start position:0%
going to she was pregnant she was going
 
02:12:53.750 --> 02:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
to have an abortion
 
02:12:56.310 --> 02:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
at that time i was not in health care i
 
02:12:58.709 --> 02:12:58.719 align:start position:0%
did not appreciate
 
02:13:01.750 --> 02:13:01.760 align:start position:0%
anything about life other than
 
02:13:05.350 --> 02:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
where i was as a 20 26 year old
 
02:13:07.589 --> 02:13:07.599 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
02:13:09.910 --> 02:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
individual going through a tough time in
 
02:13:11.669 --> 02:13:11.679 align:start position:0%
my life
 
02:13:13.830 --> 02:13:13.840 align:start position:0%
and my response to her was do you need
 
02:13:16.629 --> 02:13:16.639 align:start position:0%
me to go with you
 
02:13:21.589 --> 02:13:21.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:24.149 --> 02:13:24.159 align:start position:0%
she had the abortion
 
02:13:27.030 --> 02:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
and to this day
 
02:13:29.189 --> 02:13:29.199 align:start position:0%
i regret
 
02:13:32.870 --> 02:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
not saying something different to her
 
02:13:36.229 --> 02:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
i live with this every day
 
02:13:37.910 --> 02:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
we have three healthy children three
 
02:13:40.069 --> 02:13:40.079 align:start position:0%
beautiful grandchildren but i made a big
 
02:13:40.079 --> 02:13:42.069 align:start position:0%
beautiful grandchildren but i made a big
mistake

02:13:42.069 --> 02:13:42.079 align:start position:0%
mistake
 
02:13:45.189 --> 02:13:45.199 align:start position:0%
and i'm very very sorry about that and i
 
02:13:45.199 --> 02:13:46.069 align:start position:0%
and i'm very very sorry about that and i
think

02:13:46.069 --> 02:13:46.079 align:start position:0%
think
 
02:13:48.069 --> 02:13:48.079 align:start position:0%
that as my wife pointed out
 
02:13:49.189 --> 02:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
that when you
 
02:13:51.990 --> 02:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
give the person the chance to understand
 
02:13:54.870 --> 02:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
that it's a human life
 
02:13:59.589 --> 02:13:59.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:02.149 --> 02:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
no i would say one more thing 95
 
02:14:04.790 --> 02:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
statistics say 95 of all abortions are
 
02:14:07.510 --> 02:14:07.520 align:start position:0%
done for birth control and not for any
 
02:14:09.669 --> 02:14:09.679 align:start position:0%
other situation like rape incest
 
02:14:09.679 --> 02:14:10.790 align:start position:0%
other situation like rape incest
whatever

02:14:10.790 --> 02:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
02:14:12.709 --> 02:14:12.719 align:start position:0%
thank you for listening
 
02:14:14.870 --> 02:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
and if i may add
 
02:14:14.880 --> 02:14:16.709 align:start position:0%
and if i may add
one

02:14:16.709 --> 02:14:16.719 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:14:21.910 --> 02:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:21.920 --> 02:14:23.030 align:start position:0%
 
his

02:14:23.030 --> 02:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
his
 
02:14:25.589 --> 02:14:25.599 align:start position:0%
former wife
 
02:14:29.750 --> 02:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
shortly after we welcomed our third
 
02:14:32.470 --> 02:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
child into the world
 
02:14:36.709 --> 02:14:36.719 align:start position:0%
committed suicide and i truly believe
 
02:14:36.719 --> 02:14:38.629 align:start position:0%
committed suicide and i truly believe
that

02:14:38.629 --> 02:14:38.639 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:14:41.510 --> 02:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
the devastation of what she had done in
 
02:14:44.069 --> 02:14:44.079 align:start position:0%
taking another life
 
02:14:47.750 --> 02:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
was definitely a factor in her ending
 
02:14:49.109 --> 02:14:49.119 align:start position:0%
her own life
 
02:14:50.709 --> 02:14:50.719 align:start position:0%
so these things
 
02:14:51.830 --> 02:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
are not
 
02:14:55.270 --> 02:14:55.280 align:start position:0%
without the their downside
 
02:14:58.149 --> 02:14:58.159 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony both of you
 
02:15:00.069 --> 02:15:00.079 align:start position:0%
the chair now calls upon valerie
 
02:15:02.550 --> 02:15:02.560 align:start position:0%

02:15:17.270 --> 02:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
my name is valerie prescott i live in
 
02:15:20.950 --> 02:15:20.960 align:start position:0%
concord and i oppose this bill
 
02:15:23.669 --> 02:15:23.679 align:start position:0%
um i have a daughter that came to me
 
02:15:25.669 --> 02:15:25.679 align:start position:0%
well actually i was going to visit her
 
02:15:27.350 --> 02:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
so um
 
02:15:30.629 --> 02:15:30.639 align:start position:0%
that's what it was i went to visit her
 
02:15:32.870 --> 02:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
and she came to me
 
02:15:35.270 --> 02:15:35.280 align:start position:0%
and just burst into tears and said mom i
 
02:15:37.109 --> 02:15:37.119 align:start position:0%
had an abortion
 
02:15:39.510 --> 02:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
she burst into tears
 
02:15:42.069 --> 02:15:42.079 align:start position:0%
because she had an abortion
 
02:15:44.709 --> 02:15:44.719 align:start position:0%
she felt terrible i had no
 
02:15:47.430 --> 02:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
doubt in my mind it was regret over the
 
02:15:47.440 --> 02:15:49.189 align:start position:0%
doubt in my mind it was regret over the
abortion

02:15:49.189 --> 02:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
abortion
 
02:15:51.669 --> 02:15:51.679 align:start position:0%
it wasn't until
 
02:15:54.390 --> 02:15:54.400 align:start position:0%
about ten years later
 
02:15:54.400 --> 02:15:56.470 align:start position:0%
about ten years later
um

02:15:56.470 --> 02:15:56.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:59.430 --> 02:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
i found out she had been raped because
 
02:16:01.270 --> 02:16:01.280 align:start position:0%
and that's part of the reason why she
 
02:16:01.610 --> 02:16:01.620 align:start position:0%
had an
 
02:16:01.620 --> 02:16:02.830 align:start position:0%
had an
[Music]

02:16:02.830 --> 02:16:02.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:16:06.390 --> 02:16:06.400 align:start position:0%
abortion but she regretted it
 
02:16:08.390 --> 02:16:08.400 align:start position:0%
she regretted it and that's all i wanted
 
02:16:10.870 --> 02:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
to say thank you thank you no questions
 
02:16:13.430 --> 02:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
thank you so much
 
02:16:16.629 --> 02:16:16.639 align:start position:0%
the final pink card
 
02:16:35.270 --> 02:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:37.270 --> 02:16:37.280 align:start position:0%
hello committee my name is shannon
 
02:16:39.910 --> 02:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
mcginley and i live in bedford and i'm
 
02:16:41.750 --> 02:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
speaking on behalf of myself this
 
02:16:43.509 --> 02:16:43.519 align:start position:0%
morning this afternoon
 
02:16:47.669 --> 02:16:47.679 align:start position:0%
i speak in opposition to hb 1609
 
02:16:49.589 --> 02:16:49.599 align:start position:0%
i feel like that this bill is a death by
 
02:16:51.030 --> 02:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
a thousand cuts
 
02:16:52.870 --> 02:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
the sponsors seem to put language in
 
02:16:55.270 --> 02:16:55.280 align:start position:0%
that completely blows up this law
 
02:16:57.589 --> 02:16:57.599 align:start position:0%
and tries to distract us by invoking
 
02:16:59.669 --> 02:16:59.679 align:start position:0%
emotion by putting in
 
02:17:02.309 --> 02:17:02.319 align:start position:0%
other tangential carve outs and even
 
02:17:04.070 --> 02:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
attempts to sweeten the pot by adding
 
02:17:05.910 --> 02:17:05.920 align:start position:0%
something that they know
 
02:17:05.920 --> 02:17:06.950 align:start position:0%
something that they know
might

02:17:06.950 --> 02:17:06.960 align:start position:0%
might
 
02:17:09.429 --> 02:17:09.439 align:start position:0%
provoke support for the law amongst
 
02:17:11.190 --> 02:17:11.200 align:start position:0%
those that support the fetal life
 
02:17:12.549 --> 02:17:12.559 align:start position:0%
protection act
 
02:17:13.990 --> 02:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
i'm going to go through some of those
 
02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:15.349 align:start position:0%
i'm going to go through some of those
points

02:17:15.349 --> 02:17:15.359 align:start position:0%
points
 
02:17:16.950 --> 02:17:16.960 align:start position:0%
the first thing is the ultrasound
 
02:17:19.270 --> 02:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
requirement we've heard many times
 
02:17:21.030 --> 02:17:21.040 align:start position:0%
before that this would make the law
 
02:17:23.509 --> 02:17:23.519 align:start position:0%
completely unenforceable rendering the
 
02:17:25.270 --> 02:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
law meaningless which i would argue is
 
02:17:27.190 --> 02:17:27.200 align:start position:0%
worse than having nothing on the books
 
02:17:30.230 --> 02:17:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:33.270 --> 02:17:33.280 align:start position:0%
i've been pregnant six times
 
02:17:34.870 --> 02:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
i have never
 
02:17:36.950 --> 02:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
the only time that i had a transvaginal
 
02:17:39.990 --> 02:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
ultrasound was when i had a miscarriage
 
02:17:42.230 --> 02:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
and when i was at the emergency room at
 
02:17:45.509 --> 02:17:45.519 align:start position:0%
cmc during the miscarriage at 11 weeks
 
02:17:47.830 --> 02:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
they did that ultrasound in order to
 
02:17:50.230 --> 02:17:50.240 align:start position:0%
determine that whether i had expelled
 
02:17:50.240 --> 02:17:51.589 align:start position:0%
determine that whether i had expelled
everything

02:17:51.589 --> 02:17:51.599 align:start position:0%
everything
 
02:17:53.349 --> 02:17:53.359 align:start position:0%
and for my you know
 
02:17:55.270 --> 02:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
to prevent infection
 
02:17:55.280 --> 02:17:56.389 align:start position:0%
to prevent infection
and

02:17:56.389 --> 02:17:56.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:17:58.870 --> 02:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
i have a letter from a physician in ob
 
02:18:01.910 --> 02:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
gyn at cmc that i'm going to email all
 
02:18:03.110 --> 02:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
of you
 
02:18:04.870 --> 02:18:04.880 align:start position:0%
where he talks about the use of a
 
02:18:07.190 --> 02:18:07.200 align:start position:0%
transvaginal ultrasound versus an
 
02:18:09.270 --> 02:18:09.280 align:start position:0%
abdominal ultrasound
 
02:18:12.230 --> 02:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
and he talks about the it's dr damian
 
02:18:15.429 --> 02:18:15.439 align:start position:0%
olson he's in the practice that i go to
 
02:18:17.270 --> 02:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
and he talks about the use of the
 
02:18:19.270 --> 02:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
transvaginal ultrasound being in
 
02:18:21.509 --> 02:18:21.519 align:start position:0%
situations where there's a question
 
02:18:24.230 --> 02:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
about the integrity of the cervix if
 
02:18:25.750 --> 02:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
there's a compromise question of you
 
02:18:29.270 --> 02:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
know that the cervix is compromised or a
 
02:18:30.950 --> 02:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
placenta previa
 
02:18:30.960 --> 02:18:31.830 align:start position:0%
placenta previa
um

02:18:31.830 --> 02:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:35.910 --> 02:18:35.920 align:start position:0%
and that transvaginal ultrasound is not
 
02:18:37.750 --> 02:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
used later in the pregnancy around the
 
02:18:39.669 --> 02:18:39.679 align:start position:0%
time of the 24 weeks that we're talking
 
02:18:42.549 --> 02:18:42.559 align:start position:0%
about in our current law
 
02:18:45.030 --> 02:18:45.040 align:start position:0%
i would also add representative john
 
02:18:47.750 --> 02:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
graham earlier spoke about the
 
02:18:50.389 --> 02:18:50.399 align:start position:0%
transvaginal ultrasound earlier on in
 
02:18:53.750 --> 02:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
pregnancy that it was perhaps because
 
02:18:55.619 --> 02:18:55.629 align:start position:0%
his wife was considered to be
 
02:18:55.629 --> 02:18:57.110 align:start position:0%
his wife was considered to be
[Music]

02:18:57.110 --> 02:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:18:57.120 --> 02:18:58.070 align:start position:0%
[Music]
a

02:18:58.070 --> 02:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:19:00.790 --> 02:19:00.800 align:start position:0%
geriatric pregnancy i too was considered
 
02:19:02.870 --> 02:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
to be a geriatric pregnancy with my last
 
02:19:06.230 --> 02:19:06.240 align:start position:0%
pregnancy as i was 45 at the time and i
 
02:19:08.150 --> 02:19:08.160 align:start position:0%
did not experience transvaginal
 
02:19:10.870 --> 02:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
ultrasounds throughout that pregnancy
 
02:19:13.750 --> 02:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
um the second thing is is that the the
 
02:19:16.070 --> 02:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
bill does add this additional health
 
02:19:18.070 --> 02:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
exception and doesn't define it and like
 
02:19:20.309 --> 02:19:20.319 align:start position:0%
what's been mentioned here before this
 
02:19:22.389 --> 02:19:22.399 align:start position:0%
morning i am concerned about that health
 
02:19:24.950 --> 02:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
of the mother exception being
 
02:19:27.349 --> 02:19:27.359 align:start position:0%
an open door for any abortion reason
 
02:19:30.790 --> 02:19:30.800 align:start position:0%
whatsoever emotional familial um and and
 
02:19:32.230 --> 02:19:32.240 align:start position:0%
for age
 
02:19:34.629 --> 02:19:34.639 align:start position:0%
thirdly rape and incest exceptions
 
02:19:36.629 --> 02:19:36.639 align:start position:0%
certainly this vote invokes a great deal
 
02:19:38.469 --> 02:19:38.479 align:start position:0%
of emotion there is an exception for
 
02:19:40.469 --> 02:19:40.479 align:start position:0%
rape and incest and law in this law by
 
02:19:42.870 --> 02:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
virtue of it being 24 weeks why like
 
02:19:45.910 --> 02:19:45.920 align:start position:0%
what's been said earlier in testimony
 
02:19:47.830 --> 02:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
the mother has known for months that
 
02:19:49.349 --> 02:19:49.359 align:start position:0%
she's pregnant and although there are
 
02:19:52.710 --> 02:19:52.720 align:start position:0%
those very rare circumstances when um a
 
02:19:55.030 --> 02:19:55.040 align:start position:0%
woman may not know that she is pregnant
 
02:19:58.230 --> 02:19:58.240 align:start position:0%
we cannot have um we can't rule by law
 
02:20:00.710 --> 02:20:00.720 align:start position:0%
by exceptions that's not a healthy way
 
02:20:00.720 --> 02:20:01.670 align:start position:0%
by exceptions that's not a healthy way
we

02:20:01.670 --> 02:20:01.680 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:20:04.630 --> 02:20:04.640 align:start position:0%
we we don't generally rule by exceptions
 
02:20:06.870 --> 02:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
in the law across the board
 
02:20:09.990 --> 02:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
fourthly fetal anomaly um has been added
 
02:20:11.830 --> 02:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
and there's there's no reason to kill an
 
02:20:13.830 --> 02:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
innocent preborn child because the child
 
02:20:14.870 --> 02:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
might die
 
02:20:16.790 --> 02:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
i think that representative
 
02:20:19.429 --> 02:20:19.439 align:start position:0%
leon made a very good point earlier
 
02:20:21.510 --> 02:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
when she asked the question about
 
02:20:23.670 --> 02:20:23.680 align:start position:0%
whether or not the child could just be
 
02:20:26.309 --> 02:20:26.319 align:start position:0%
delivered prematurely if you if you have
 
02:20:28.630 --> 02:20:28.640 align:start position:0%
a questionable situation where there's
 
02:20:31.030 --> 02:20:31.040 align:start position:0%
perhaps even a risk to the mother's life
 
02:20:33.270 --> 02:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
generally the physician the the
 
02:20:35.429 --> 02:20:35.439 align:start position:0%
ob gyn would look at the situation say
 
02:20:37.510 --> 02:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
i've got two patients here and i've got
 
02:20:39.990 --> 02:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
to do whatever i can to to save them
 
02:20:42.230 --> 02:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
both and if that means to go ahead and
 
02:20:45.030 --> 02:20:45.040 align:start position:0%
deliver the child early earlier then
 
02:20:47.110 --> 02:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
that's certainly
 
02:20:49.349 --> 02:20:49.359 align:start position:0%
a preferable option
 
02:20:51.270 --> 02:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
and then lastly
 
02:20:53.349 --> 02:20:53.359 align:start position:0%
it talks about in the in the in this
 
02:20:55.429 --> 02:20:55.439 align:start position:0%
particular bill about abortion
 
02:20:57.910 --> 02:20:57.920 align:start position:0%
statistics and i just want to point out
 
02:20:59.510 --> 02:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
that although that could be tempting
 
02:21:01.270 --> 02:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
because certainly
 
02:21:03.349 --> 02:21:03.359 align:start position:0%
pro-lifers in the state and others that
 
02:21:05.030 --> 02:21:05.040 align:start position:0%
are not necessarily even pro-life have
 
02:21:07.750 --> 02:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
been advocating and trying to pass
 
02:21:10.150 --> 02:21:10.160 align:start position:0%
legislation to require abortion
 
02:21:12.230 --> 02:21:12.240 align:start position:0%
statistics because we are one of only
 
02:21:14.070 --> 02:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
three states in the country
 
02:21:15.990 --> 02:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
that um does not collect that
 
02:21:17.590 --> 02:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
information and i would think that it
 
02:21:20.070 --> 02:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
would be difficult to make public policy
 
02:21:22.389 --> 02:21:22.399 align:start position:0%
surrounding pregnancy and whatnot when
 
02:21:24.550 --> 02:21:24.560 align:start position:0%
we don't know what those statistics are
 
02:21:27.270 --> 02:21:27.280 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire but i would point out
 
02:21:29.030 --> 02:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
that the language that's in this
 
02:21:32.790 --> 02:21:32.800 align:start position:0%
particular law is not um the anywhere
 
02:21:34.790 --> 02:21:34.800 align:start position:0%
near the kinds of abortion statistic
 
02:21:36.630 --> 02:21:36.640 align:start position:0%
language that we're looking for because
 
02:21:38.830 --> 02:21:38.840 align:start position:0%
the language represents that it's
 
02:21:41.110 --> 02:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
optional there has been a lot of talk
 
02:21:43.429 --> 02:21:43.439 align:start position:0%
about the fetal anomaly and i i wasn't
 
02:21:46.309 --> 02:21:46.319 align:start position:0%
intending to to get into this in this
 
02:21:47.990 --> 02:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
particular hearing
 
02:21:49.750 --> 02:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
but it just seems like there's such a
 
02:21:52.150 --> 02:21:52.160 align:start position:0%
focus on this idea that we need to be
 
02:21:54.550 --> 02:21:54.560 align:start position:0%
able to have third trimester abortions
 
02:21:57.750 --> 02:21:57.760 align:start position:0%
because of potential fetal anomalies
 
02:21:57.760 --> 02:21:58.630 align:start position:0%
because of potential fetal anomalies
and

02:21:58.630 --> 02:21:58.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:22:00.950 --> 02:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
abort i would also just throw out that
 
02:22:03.670 --> 02:22:03.680 align:start position:0%
doctors make mistakes and in that that
 
02:22:05.670 --> 02:22:05.680 align:start position:0%
that fifth pregnancy or sixth pregnancy
 
02:22:08.630 --> 02:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
that i had um
 
02:22:11.590 --> 02:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
when i was 45 i received a prenatal
 
02:22:14.630 --> 02:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
diagnosis from a local hospital here in
 
02:22:17.349 --> 02:22:17.359 align:start position:0%
new hampshire that was not what any
 
02:22:19.750 --> 02:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
mother wants to hear and it was
 
02:22:22.070 --> 02:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
advocated by that attending physician at
 
02:22:23.910 --> 02:22:23.920 align:start position:0%
the level 2 ultrasound again an
 
02:22:26.309 --> 02:22:26.319 align:start position:0%
abdominal ultrasound even at that case
 
02:22:28.550 --> 02:22:28.560 align:start position:0%
at 20 weeks i was probably about 19
 
02:22:29.910 --> 02:22:29.920 align:start position:0%
weeks actually
 
02:22:29.920 --> 02:22:31.270 align:start position:0%
weeks actually
that

02:22:31.270 --> 02:22:31.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:22:33.670 --> 02:22:33.680 align:start position:0%
that i choose to terminate because of
 
02:22:36.070 --> 02:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
that diagnosis and although it wasn't
 
02:22:39.670 --> 02:22:39.680 align:start position:0%
life-threatening it was going to involve
 
02:22:41.349 --> 02:22:41.359 align:start position:0%
continual treatments
 
02:22:43.990 --> 02:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
throughout their life and that also that
 
02:22:48.070 --> 02:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:49.270 --> 02:22:49.280 align:start position:0%
would have
 
02:22:52.070 --> 02:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
fetal or outward anomalies and just just
 
02:22:53.750 --> 02:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
um can't you think what i'm looking for
 
02:22:56.630 --> 02:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
but um
 
02:22:59.190 --> 02:22:59.200 align:start position:0%
would not appear normal let's say
 
02:23:01.750 --> 02:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
um and so my husband and i chose to get
 
02:23:03.830 --> 02:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
a second opinion at boston children's
 
02:23:06.710 --> 02:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
hospital where i underwent another
 
02:23:09.349 --> 02:23:09.359 align:start position:0%
ultrasound down there and an mri and
 
02:23:12.469 --> 02:23:12.479 align:start position:0%
several tests with a team of physicians
 
02:23:15.110 --> 02:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
over the course an entire day we we went
 
02:23:16.150 --> 02:23:16.160 align:start position:0%
through testing from eight in the
 
02:23:17.670 --> 02:23:17.680 align:start position:0%
morning until five o'clock at night and
 
02:23:19.270 --> 02:23:19.280 align:start position:0%
met at six o'clock that night with a
 
02:23:21.830 --> 02:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
team and they said we believe that you
 
02:23:24.230 --> 02:23:24.240 align:start position:0%
have a completely normal and healthy son
 
02:23:25.990 --> 02:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
and we don't know why you received this
 
02:23:28.469 --> 02:23:28.479 align:start position:0%
diagnosis from the hospital in new
 
02:23:28.479 --> 02:23:29.670 align:start position:0%
diagnosis from the hospital in new

hampshire
 
02:23:31.670 --> 02:23:31.680 align:start position:0%
and so not knowing you know you got
 
02:23:32.710 --> 02:23:32.720 align:start position:0%
which one are you going to believe you
 
02:23:35.349 --> 02:23:35.359 align:start position:0%

02:23:38.230 --> 02:23:38.240 align:start position:0%
say that my little aiden was born at
 
02:23:41.429 --> 02:23:41.439 align:start position:0%
catholic medical center in 2016 and was
 
02:23:43.190 --> 02:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
totally healthy and had none of the
 
02:23:45.590 --> 02:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
things that he had been diagnosed and i
 
02:23:48.389 --> 02:23:48.399 align:start position:0%

for taking my questions um
 
02:24:16.230 --> 02:24:16.240 align:start position:0%
i i wish we had had a couple more
 
02:24:17.429 --> 02:24:17.439 align:start position:0%
doctors here because i have a lot of
 
02:24:19.349 --> 02:24:19.359 align:start position:0%
medical questions so you may or may not
 
02:24:21.750 --> 02:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
be able to answer answer this
 
02:24:21.760 --> 02:24:23.030 align:start position:0%

um
 
02:24:25.429 --> 02:24:25.439 align:start position:0%
if a woman is raped which is just
 
02:24:28.550 --> 02:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
horrendous and she's being seen
 
02:24:32.150 --> 02:24:32.160 align:start position:0%
in the er or by a private physician
 
02:24:33.670 --> 02:24:33.680 align:start position:0%
would she
 
02:24:36.150 --> 02:24:36.160 align:start position:0%
in normal practice or is it usual for
 
02:24:38.309 --> 02:24:38.319 align:start position:0%
her to be offered right there on the
 
02:24:38.319 --> 02:24:39.429 align:start position:0%
her to be offered right there on the
spot

02:24:39.429 --> 02:24:39.439 align:start position:0%
spot
 
02:24:41.590 --> 02:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
what would what was commonly referred to
 
02:24:43.750 --> 02:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
as a morning after pill
 
02:24:46.150 --> 02:24:46.160 align:start position:0%
based on i am not a physician but based
 
02:24:49.030 --> 02:24:49.040 align:start position:0%
on my experience in dealing with these
 
02:24:51.910 --> 02:24:51.920 align:start position:0%
life kinds of issues and certainly rape
 
02:24:54.950 --> 02:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
and incest is a part of that discussion
 
02:24:57.349 --> 02:24:57.359 align:start position:0%
it is it is my understanding that the
 
02:24:59.429 --> 02:24:59.439 align:start position:0%
morning after pill is consistently
 
02:25:02.309 --> 02:25:02.319 align:start position:0%
offered to sexual assault individuals
 
02:25:08.870 --> 02:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:11.190 --> 02:25:11.200 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for your testimony
 
02:25:13.590 --> 02:25:13.600 align:start position:0%

why why when we are one hour behind
 
02:25:49.349 --> 02:25:49.359 align:start position:0%
on our hearings
 
02:25:51.190 --> 02:25:51.200 align:start position:0%
and this is not i know that it's noticed
 
02:25:53.590 --> 02:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
that executive session may occur at any
 
02:25:53.600 --> 02:25:54.469 align:start position:0%
that executive session may occur at any
time

02:25:54.469 --> 02:25:54.479 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:25:55.670 --> 02:25:55.680 align:start position:0%
but there are a lot of important
 
02:25:57.510 --> 02:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
stakeholders who are not
 
02:25:58.870 --> 02:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
maybe in the room because they didn't
 
02:26:00.469 --> 02:26:00.479 align:start position:0%
expect an executive session on a
 
02:26:01.990 --> 02:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
controversial bill to be done
 
02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:03.590 align:start position:0%
controversial bill to be done
immediately

02:26:03.590 --> 02:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
immediately
 
02:26:03.600 --> 02:26:04.389 align:start position:0%
immediately
and

02:26:04.389 --> 02:26:04.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:26:06.150 --> 02:26:06.160 align:start position:0%
people have not had a chance to prepare
 
02:26:07.990 --> 02:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
amendments that they may wish to bring
 
02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:09.429 align:start position:0%
amendments that they may wish to bring
forward

02:26:09.429 --> 02:26:09.439 align:start position:0%
forward
 
02:26:11.590 --> 02:26:11.600 align:start position:0%

02:26:17.750 --> 02:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
have heard the testimony which sometimes
 
02:26:19.670 --> 02:26:19.680 align:start position:0%
drives us in terms of thinking how we
 
02:26:21.750 --> 02:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
might craft an amendment
 
02:26:23.349 --> 02:26:23.359 align:start position:0%
and the members of the public will not
 
02:26:25.670 --> 02:26:25.680 align:start position:0%
be aware to be present
 
02:26:25.680 --> 02:26:27.750 align:start position:0%

02:30:07.120 --> 02:30:08.389 align:start position:0%
 
okay

i'm gonna make about four five
 
02:31:47.990 --> 02:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:51.110 --> 02:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:09.590 --> 02:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:41.750 --> 02:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:41.760 --> 02:32:58.870 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:32:58.870 --> 02:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:00.469 --> 02:33:00.479 align:start position:0%
point of order who raised the point of
 
02:33:03.590 --> 02:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
order i do who is i uh i'm sorry i know
 
02:33:05.670 --> 02:33:05.680 align:start position:0%
i represent can never forget a forehead
 
02:33:09.270 --> 02:33:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:10.309 --> 02:33:10.319 align:start position:0%
yes sir
 
02:33:10.319 --> 02:33:11.349 align:start position:0%
yes sir
uh

02:33:11.349 --> 02:33:11.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:33:14.070 --> 02:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
with the the democrats would actually
 
02:33:15.750 --> 02:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
again because we've had no chance to
 
02:33:17.349 --> 02:33:17.359 align:start position:0%
actually think about the democrats would
 
02:33:19.110 --> 02:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
like to have a caucus since we've not
 
02:33:21.349 --> 02:33:21.359 align:start position:0%
had a chance to have any conversation
 
02:33:22.870 --> 02:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
about this um
 
02:33:25.830 --> 02:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
amendment would that be appropriate uh i
 
02:33:27.110 --> 02:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
don't know whether it's appropriate or
 
02:33:29.429 --> 02:33:29.439 align:start position:0%
not but i think that's an appropriate
 
02:33:30.630 --> 02:33:30.640 align:start position:0%
idea to me
 
02:33:32.790 --> 02:33:32.800 align:start position:0%
so yes you may if you wish can we
 
02:33:34.469 --> 02:33:34.479 align:start position:0%
probably we should try to limit to more
 
02:33:36.309 --> 02:33:36.319 align:start position:0%
than maybe five minutes because we are
 
02:33:38.389 --> 02:33:38.399 align:start position:0%
far far behind right now
 
02:33:38.399 --> 02:33:40.309 align:start position:0%
far far behind right now
well

02:33:40.309 --> 02:33:40.319 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:33:42.550 --> 02:33:42.560 align:start position:0%
take a reasonable amount of time
 
02:33:44.070 --> 02:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
but i mean to let everybody know so we
 
02:33:45.910 --> 02:33:45.920 align:start position:0%
get back in the room quickly
 
02:33:49.670 --> 02:33:49.680 align:start position:0%
all right should we say be back by
 
02:33:49.680 --> 02:33:51.190 align:start position:0%
all right should we say be back by
1208.

02:33:51.190 --> 02:33:51.200 align:start position:0%
1208.
 
02:33:52.550 --> 02:33:52.560 align:start position:0%
it gives you about 10. that's only four
 
02:33:54.469 --> 02:33:54.479 align:start position:0%
minutes but i'll take 12. no no no no it
 
02:33:54.479 --> 02:33:56.070 align:start position:0%
minutes but i'll take 12. no no no no it
doesn't

02:33:56.070 --> 02:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
02:33:59.110 --> 02:33:59.120 align:start position:0%
don't worry about it let's say 12 10.
 
02:34:02.230 --> 02:34:02.240 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:34:27.510 --> 02:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:27.520 --> 02:35:03.910 align:start position:0%

um for those on the committee that might
 
02:43:18.870 --> 02:43:18.880 align:start position:0%
not know
 
02:43:21.590 --> 02:43:21.600 align:start position:0%
um i was the sponsor of the fetal
 
02:43:23.670 --> 02:43:23.680 align:start position:0%
protection act so
 
02:43:26.790 --> 02:43:26.800 align:start position:0%
this is near and dear to my heart
 
02:43:28.389 --> 02:43:28.399 align:start position:0%
and this is something that my
 
02:43:28.399 --> 02:43:29.990 align:start position:0%
and this is something that my
constituents

02:43:29.990 --> 02:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
constituents
 
02:43:31.990 --> 02:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
have very near and dear to their hearts
 
02:43:35.030 --> 02:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
and so i was thrilled with all the work
 
02:43:37.030 --> 02:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
that went into the bill
 
02:43:40.230 --> 02:43:40.240 align:start position:0%
so that i mean we ran it past judges and
 
02:43:41.990 --> 02:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
lawyers and all of that and we thought
 
02:43:43.670 --> 02:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
we had it down
 
02:43:46.389 --> 02:43:46.399 align:start position:0%
but just like law in history has
 
02:43:48.710 --> 02:43:48.720 align:start position:0%
happened it all started with
 
02:43:51.269 --> 02:43:51.279 align:start position:0%
the ten commandments and do not murder
 
02:43:53.030 --> 02:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
and then the judges got involved and
 
02:43:54.550 --> 02:43:54.560 align:start position:0%
pretty soon there were
 
02:43:56.070 --> 02:43:56.080 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:43:57.990 --> 02:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
well what if it's self-defense and what
 
02:43:59.750 --> 02:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
if it's this and so the law just kept
 
02:44:01.590 --> 02:44:01.600 align:start position:0%
getting more and more and more and more
 
02:44:01.600 --> 02:44:03.030 align:start position:0%
getting more and more and more and more
complicated

02:44:03.030 --> 02:44:03.040 align:start position:0%
complicated
 
02:44:05.910 --> 02:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
and so we have to fine-tune our laws
 
02:44:08.309 --> 02:44:08.319 align:start position:0%
more and more and more because
 
02:44:10.070 --> 02:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
of what happened with this bill is a
 
02:44:12.230 --> 02:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
perfect example
 
02:44:13.510 --> 02:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
when i
 
02:44:16.230 --> 02:44:16.240 align:start position:0%
put the bill out i got a lot of emails
 
02:44:19.110 --> 02:44:19.120 align:start position:0%
mostly in support but you can imagine
 
02:44:20.710 --> 02:44:20.720 align:start position:0%
that i got some that weren't all that
 
02:44:20.720 --> 02:44:22.230 align:start position:0%
that i got some that weren't all that
nice

02:44:22.230 --> 02:44:22.240 align:start position:0%
nice
 
02:44:25.750 --> 02:44:25.760 align:start position:0%
what i found consistently
 
02:44:28.150 --> 02:44:28.160 align:start position:0%
is that no one of those people ever
 
02:44:30.550 --> 02:44:30.560 align:start position:0%
talked about
 
02:44:33.750 --> 02:44:33.760 align:start position:0%
the rape situation the incest
 
02:44:35.750 --> 02:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
or anything like that it was all
 
02:44:38.469 --> 02:44:38.479 align:start position:0%
surrounding the ultrasound portion of
 
02:44:39.429 --> 02:44:39.439 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
02:44:40.630 --> 02:44:40.640 align:start position:0%
they thought
 
02:44:43.349 --> 02:44:43.359 align:start position:0%
by reading it and we've heard today that
 
02:44:45.510 --> 02:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
someone you know a legislator thought by
 
02:44:47.990 --> 02:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
reading it it meant an ultrasound would
 
02:44:50.389 --> 02:44:50.399 align:start position:0%
be required all through pregnancy which
 
02:44:50.399 --> 02:44:51.190 align:start position:0%
be required all through pregnancy which
was

02:44:51.190 --> 02:44:51.200 align:start position:0%
was
 
02:44:53.590 --> 02:44:53.600 align:start position:0%
not what was meant by the bill
 
02:44:56.950 --> 02:44:56.960 align:start position:0%
um we also had people who uh assumed it
 
02:44:56.960 --> 02:44:57.910 align:start position:0%
um we also had people who uh assumed it
was

02:44:57.910 --> 02:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
was
 
02:44:57.920 --> 02:44:59.670 align:start position:0%
was
um

02:44:59.670 --> 02:44:59.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:45:02.230 --> 02:45:02.240 align:start position:0%
a transvaginal ultrasound that was
 
02:45:02.240 --> 02:45:03.830 align:start position:0%
a transvaginal ultrasound that was
required

02:45:03.830 --> 02:45:03.840 align:start position:0%
required
 
02:45:06.469 --> 02:45:06.479 align:start position:0%
that was never intended in the bill
 
02:45:09.990 --> 02:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
um and so all the the confusion
 
02:45:10.000 --> 02:45:11.269 align:start position:0%
um and so all the the confusion
surrounded

02:45:11.269 --> 02:45:11.279 align:start position:0%
surrounded
 
02:45:12.630 --> 02:45:12.640 align:start position:0%
the ultrasound
 
02:45:15.830 --> 02:45:15.840 align:start position:0%
of all the the uh mail phone calls and
 
02:45:18.230 --> 02:45:18.240 align:start position:0%
emails that i got on this that were not
 
02:45:18.240 --> 02:45:19.510 align:start position:0%
emails that i got on this that were not
happy

02:45:19.510 --> 02:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
happy
 
02:45:22.550 --> 02:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
so my thought was let's
 
02:45:25.510 --> 02:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
fix the misunderstanding
 
02:45:26.830 --> 02:45:26.840 align:start position:0%
so that it's
 
02:45:29.670 --> 02:45:29.680 align:start position:0%
clarified and that's what this amendment
 
02:45:29.680 --> 02:45:30.710 align:start position:0%
clarified and that's what this amendment
does

02:45:30.710 --> 02:45:30.720 align:start position:0%
does
 
02:45:34.550 --> 02:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
it just clarifies it so there can be
 
02:45:34.560 --> 02:45:37.510 align:start position:0%
it just clarifies it so there can be
no

02:45:37.510 --> 02:45:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:40.150 --> 02:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
wrong conclusions drawn that they have
 
02:45:42.389 --> 02:45:42.399 align:start position:0%
to do the ultrasound before
 
02:45:44.950 --> 02:45:44.960 align:start position:0%
every abortion
 
02:45:47.349 --> 02:45:47.359 align:start position:0%
and that was the most important thing
 
02:45:49.510 --> 02:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
that i felt and that they don't it's
 
02:45:51.910 --> 02:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
just an abdominal
 
02:45:55.830 --> 02:45:55.840 align:start position:0%
abortion done in that last trimester
 
02:45:55.840 --> 02:45:57.190 align:start position:0%
abortion done in that last trimester
and

02:45:57.190 --> 02:45:57.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:46:01.750 --> 02:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
so it just clears up that confusion over
 
02:46:04.230 --> 02:46:04.240 align:start position:0%
what kind of ultrasound is done and when
 
02:46:06.950 --> 02:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
it's done because that is what i heard
 
02:46:10.230 --> 02:46:10.240 align:start position:0%
the most about
 
02:46:13.750 --> 02:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
i'll allow questions to the sponsor and
 
02:46:16.710 --> 02:46:16.720 align:start position:0%
i'd like to alternate um democrat and
 
02:46:19.349 --> 02:46:19.359 align:start position:0%
republican uh until
 
02:46:21.269 --> 02:46:21.279 align:start position:0%
one side is finished to having questions
 
02:46:23.030 --> 02:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
and then we'll finish up with whatever
 
02:46:25.750 --> 02:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
is left over so any questions from your
 
02:46:27.750 --> 02:46:27.760 align:start position:0%
side for the sponsor representative
 
02:46:27.760 --> 02:46:29.349 align:start position:0%
side for the sponsor representative
knurk

02:46:29.349 --> 02:46:29.359 align:start position:0%
knurk
 
02:46:31.510 --> 02:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
uh not so much a question so it doesn't
 
02:46:33.750 --> 02:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
have to be a question
 
02:46:35.349 --> 02:46:35.359 align:start position:0%
thank you i'd like to speak to the
 
02:46:37.110 --> 02:46:37.120 align:start position:0%
amendment i think it is certainly an
 
02:46:38.469 --> 02:46:38.479 align:start position:0%
improvement over the fetal life
 
02:46:39.750 --> 02:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
protection act
 
02:46:41.510 --> 02:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't go far enough and we did
 
02:46:44.230 --> 02:46:44.240 align:start position:0%
hear testimony on both sides today
 
02:46:45.830 --> 02:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
including from me
 
02:46:47.910 --> 02:46:47.920 align:start position:0%
as to why the changes that are proposed
 
02:46:49.750 --> 02:46:49.760 align:start position:0%
by the sponsor to
 
02:46:52.550 --> 02:46:52.560 align:start position:0%
through bill 1609 are quite reasonable
 
02:46:54.309 --> 02:46:54.319 align:start position:0%
in fact i again i wanted to go just a
 
02:46:55.910 --> 02:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
little bit further
 
02:46:57.670 --> 02:46:57.680 align:start position:0%
we also do see this letter from the
 
02:47:00.309 --> 02:47:00.319 align:start position:0%
governor who is supporting this
 
02:47:02.469 --> 02:47:02.479 align:start position:0%
and 1609 that is
 
02:47:03.990 --> 02:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
and not
 
02:47:05.269 --> 02:47:05.279 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
02:47:06.630 --> 02:47:06.640 align:start position:0%
you probably didn't see that but in any
 
02:47:09.429 --> 02:47:09.439 align:start position:0%
case it is a supporting 1609
 
02:47:11.269 --> 02:47:11.279 align:start position:0%
so given the fact that the amendment
 
02:47:13.510 --> 02:47:13.520 align:start position:0%
does not go far enough
 
02:47:16.469 --> 02:47:16.479 align:start position:0%
um i would vote i i personally will be
 
02:47:20.389 --> 02:47:20.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:21.429 --> 02:47:21.439 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:47:23.429 --> 02:47:23.439 align:start position:0%
anyone from
 
02:47:26.230 --> 02:47:26.240 align:start position:0%
this is remember a discussion as
 
02:47:28.150 --> 02:47:28.160 align:start position:0%
the representative rightly reminded me
 
02:47:29.349 --> 02:47:29.359 align:start position:0%
anyone on
 
02:47:31.110 --> 02:47:31.120 align:start position:0%
republican side of the playground wish
 
02:47:35.590 --> 02:47:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:38.469 --> 02:47:38.479 align:start position:0%
again you may um thank you mr chairman i
 
02:47:39.910 --> 02:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
didn't want to monopolize this
 
02:47:42.790 --> 02:47:42.800 align:start position:0%
microphone um i think that this is a
 
02:47:45.030 --> 02:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
very nice fine-tuning of what has just
 
02:47:47.750 --> 02:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
been passed into law and and what took
 
02:47:51.110 --> 02:47:51.120 align:start position:0%
enactment 18 days ago this makes clear
 
02:47:53.190 --> 02:47:53.200 align:start position:0%
that the ultrasound's not required early
 
02:47:54.550 --> 02:47:54.560 align:start position:0%
on and this
 
02:47:56.389 --> 02:47:56.399 align:start position:0%
really at this point there's a reason
 
02:47:58.870 --> 02:47:58.880 align:start position:0%
why 24 weeks is what people look at in
 
02:48:00.790 --> 02:48:00.800 align:start position:0%
the western world at that point the
 
02:48:03.030 --> 02:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
child has an over 50 chance of survival
 
02:48:04.309 --> 02:48:04.319 align:start position:0%
assuming that they have a normal
 
02:48:06.870 --> 02:48:06.880 align:start position:0%
development um you can never guarantee
 
02:48:08.710 --> 02:48:08.720 align:start position:0%
survival even if you reach full time
 
02:48:11.269 --> 02:48:11.279 align:start position:0%
either what this does is it makes it
 
02:48:13.670 --> 02:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
clear that the ultrasound's required at
 
02:48:16.150 --> 02:48:16.160 align:start position:0%
24 weeks the bill does not prohibit an
 
02:48:17.429 --> 02:48:17.439 align:start position:0%
early delivery
 
02:48:19.110 --> 02:48:19.120 align:start position:0%
so an early delivery is still a
 
02:48:20.790 --> 02:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
possibility in the case of fetal
 
02:48:22.950 --> 02:48:22.960 align:start position:0%
abnormalities and it can give those
 
02:48:25.830 --> 02:48:25.840 align:start position:0%
moments of closure without another 16
 
02:48:27.670 --> 02:48:27.680 align:start position:0%
weeks of gestation
 
02:48:27.680 --> 02:48:29.429 align:start position:0%
weeks of gestation
so

02:48:29.429 --> 02:48:29.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:48:31.269 --> 02:48:31.279 align:start position:0%
so this is something that i think really
 
02:48:33.190 --> 02:48:33.200 align:start position:0%
helps fine-tune it gets away from some
 
02:48:35.190 --> 02:48:35.200 align:start position:0%
of the other problems and honestly some
 
02:48:36.790 --> 02:48:36.800 align:start position:0%
of the questions the issues that were
 
02:48:38.630 --> 02:48:38.640 align:start position:0%
raised about the rape and incest not
 
02:48:41.190 --> 02:48:41.200 align:start position:0%
seeking care until that point um i think
 
02:48:42.469 --> 02:48:42.479 align:start position:0%
that if we as a health and human
 
02:48:44.309 --> 02:48:44.319 align:start position:0%
services committee think that simply
 
02:48:46.389 --> 02:48:46.399 align:start position:0%
allowing them to abort after that that
 
02:48:48.550 --> 02:48:48.560 align:start position:0%
point solves the problem we're missing
 
02:48:50.469 --> 02:48:50.479 align:start position:0%
the bigger problem if there are girls
 
02:48:51.990 --> 02:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
and women who are not getting care
 
02:48:54.230 --> 02:48:54.240 align:start position:0%
earlier in case of rape and incest that
 
02:48:55.670 --> 02:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
needs to be addressed entirely
 
02:48:57.590 --> 02:48:57.600 align:start position:0%
separately and
 
02:48:59.269 --> 02:48:59.279 align:start position:0%
and i think that the pregnancy part of
 
02:49:00.790 --> 02:49:00.800 align:start position:0%
that should have should have very little
 
02:49:02.950 --> 02:49:02.960 align:start position:0%
to do with her rights and the protection
 
02:49:05.110 --> 02:49:05.120 align:start position:0%
that she needs so i believe that this
 
02:49:07.190 --> 02:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
addresses the problems that that really
 
02:49:09.269 --> 02:49:09.279 align:start position:0%
have been discussed about the fetal life
 
02:49:11.190 --> 02:49:11.200 align:start position:0%
protection act and i think that this is
 
02:49:13.590 --> 02:49:13.600 align:start position:0%
a very nice way to neatly sum things up
 
02:49:15.110 --> 02:49:15.120 align:start position:0%
and then see the way that this law
 
02:49:16.550 --> 02:49:16.560 align:start position:0%
evolves because
 
02:49:18.309 --> 02:49:18.319 align:start position:0%
you know there's future legislatures as
 
02:49:20.950 --> 02:49:20.960 align:start position:0%
well if if down the road people believe
 
02:49:22.790 --> 02:49:22.800 align:start position:0%
there needs to be another change
 
02:49:24.710 --> 02:49:24.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:49:28.550 --> 02:49:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:30.309 --> 02:49:30.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
02:49:33.269 --> 02:49:33.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:35.910 --> 02:49:35.920 align:start position:0%
understanding the way i read this not
 
02:49:37.429 --> 02:49:37.439 align:start position:0%
been on the house long as some of you
 
02:49:37.439 --> 02:49:38.710 align:start position:0%
been on the house long as some of you
folks

02:49:38.710 --> 02:49:38.720 align:start position:0%
folks
 
02:49:40.870 --> 02:49:40.880 align:start position:0%
this amendment fundamentally replaces
 
02:49:42.309 --> 02:49:42.319 align:start position:0%
the underlying bill completely is that
 
02:49:42.319 --> 02:49:43.510 align:start position:0%
the underlying bill completely is that
correct

02:49:43.510 --> 02:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:49:49.990 --> 02:49:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:52.070 --> 02:49:52.080 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to add something say
 
02:50:00.150 --> 02:50:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:00.160 --> 02:50:02.150 align:start position:0%
 
off

02:50:02.150 --> 02:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
off
 
02:50:11.349 --> 02:50:11.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:13.510 --> 02:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
i don't see a light it's
 
02:50:15.429 --> 02:50:15.439 align:start position:0%
on now you're good
 
02:50:15.439 --> 02:50:17.269 align:start position:0%
on now you're good
um

02:50:17.269 --> 02:50:17.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:50:20.870 --> 02:50:20.880 align:start position:0%
once again i i fully appreciate um
 
02:50:23.510 --> 02:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
representative folsom's um
 
02:50:25.990 --> 02:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
amendment um i think it does clarify
 
02:50:27.590 --> 02:50:27.600 align:start position:0%
something that was
 
02:50:29.990 --> 02:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
obviously intelligent people on both
 
02:50:32.550 --> 02:50:32.560 align:start position:0%
sides had a disagreement of how it read
 
02:50:33.830 --> 02:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:50:37.830 --> 02:50:37.840 align:start position:0%
that amendment fully clarifies
 
02:50:40.070 --> 02:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
the part about an ultrasound
 
02:50:42.070 --> 02:50:42.080 align:start position:0%
and i appreciate that but
 
02:50:44.469 --> 02:50:44.479 align:start position:0%
i will vote against this because of what
 
02:50:46.469 --> 02:50:46.479 align:start position:0%
the amendment doesn't include and i
 
02:50:47.910 --> 02:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
think that
 
02:50:49.590 --> 02:50:49.600 align:start position:0%
one of the things that i think is really
 
02:50:49.600 --> 02:50:50.469 align:start position:0%
one of the things that i think is really
important

02:50:50.469 --> 02:50:50.479 align:start position:0%
important
 
02:50:51.910 --> 02:50:51.920 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of talk about it
 
02:50:53.830 --> 02:50:53.840 align:start position:0%
already but about
 
02:50:57.150 --> 02:50:57.160 align:start position:0%
rape and incest and i think people are
 
02:51:00.070 --> 02:51:00.080 align:start position:0%
underestimating the difficulty
 
02:51:03.590 --> 02:51:03.600 align:start position:0%
of a young person who has been raped or
 
02:51:07.510 --> 02:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
has been an incestuous relationship
 
02:51:09.429 --> 02:51:09.439 align:start position:0%
people have been underestimating the
 
02:51:12.150 --> 02:51:12.160 align:start position:0%
difficulties of what it takes to get
 
02:51:14.710 --> 02:51:14.720 align:start position:0%
themselves out of that situation
 
02:51:16.710 --> 02:51:16.720 align:start position:0%
and rise to the occasion where they can
 
02:51:19.190 --> 02:51:19.200 align:start position:0%
really speak up for themselves
 
02:51:19.200 --> 02:51:22.550 align:start position:0%
really speak up for themselves
and

02:51:22.550 --> 02:51:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:24.790 --> 02:51:24.800 align:start position:0%
you know and in some cases that will
 
02:51:27.670 --> 02:51:27.680 align:start position:0%
come after 24 weeks and um there is no
 
02:51:29.750 --> 02:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
exception for that so i won't be voting
 
02:51:30.830 --> 02:51:30.840 align:start position:0%
for this
 
02:51:30.840 --> 02:51:32.469 align:start position:0%
for this
amendment

02:51:32.469 --> 02:51:32.479 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:51:34.309 --> 02:51:34.319 align:start position:0%
thank you sir representative folsom
 
02:51:36.790 --> 02:51:36.800 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
02:51:39.670 --> 02:51:39.680 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro
 
02:51:42.070 --> 02:51:42.080 align:start position:0%
i've never told anybody this in public
 
02:51:42.080 --> 02:51:43.030 align:start position:0%
i've never told anybody this in public
okay

02:51:43.030 --> 02:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:51:44.830 --> 02:51:44.840 align:start position:0%
i do
 
02:51:47.750 --> 02:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
understand what someone goes through
 
02:51:50.070 --> 02:51:50.080 align:start position:0%
when they've been raped
 
02:51:54.070 --> 02:51:54.080 align:start position:0%
and i have had to make some decisions
 
02:51:56.950 --> 02:51:56.960 align:start position:0%
it's not easy
 
02:52:01.830 --> 02:52:01.840 align:start position:0%
but that's the counseling i got was not
 
02:52:04.389 --> 02:52:04.399 align:start position:0%
to abort or not abort a baby
 
02:52:07.110 --> 02:52:07.120 align:start position:0%
the counseling that helped me
 
02:52:09.110 --> 02:52:09.120 align:start position:0%
move forward in my life
 
02:52:14.230 --> 02:52:14.240 align:start position:0%
was counseling surrounding the rape
 
02:52:16.469 --> 02:52:16.479 align:start position:0%
and that's where i agree with
 
02:52:18.389 --> 02:52:18.399 align:start position:0%
representative leon
 
02:52:21.030 --> 02:52:21.040 align:start position:0%
that's if you are concerned about rape
 
02:52:23.190 --> 02:52:23.200 align:start position:0%
and incest
 
02:52:26.230 --> 02:52:26.240 align:start position:0%
that is where you need to put
 
02:52:30.309 --> 02:52:30.319 align:start position:0%
your work into helping the women at that
 
02:52:30.319 --> 02:52:31.269 align:start position:0%
your work into helping the women at that
point

02:52:31.269 --> 02:52:31.279 align:start position:0%
point
 
02:52:36.469 --> 02:52:36.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:38.870 --> 02:52:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:41.349 --> 02:52:41.359 align:start position:0%
representative kanark may i just respond
 
02:52:41.359 --> 02:52:42.550 align:start position:0%
representative kanark may i just respond
um

02:52:42.550 --> 02:52:42.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:52:44.469 --> 02:52:44.479 align:start position:0%
i feel saying is i can walk and chew gum
 
02:52:46.790 --> 02:52:46.800 align:start position:0%
at the same time i think we can deal
 
02:52:49.349 --> 02:52:49.359 align:start position:0%
with the problem of inadequate health
 
02:52:49.359 --> 02:52:50.469 align:start position:0%
with the problem of inadequate health
care

02:52:50.469 --> 02:52:50.479 align:start position:0%
care
 
02:52:52.790 --> 02:52:52.800 align:start position:0%
poor mental health care for women of
 
02:52:54.870 --> 02:52:54.880 align:start position:0%
sexual who've been submitted to sexual
 
02:52:57.830 --> 02:52:57.840 align:start position:0%
violence and still offer them the
 
02:53:02.469 --> 02:53:02.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:05.190 --> 02:53:05.200 align:start position:0%
representative folsom
 
02:53:05.200 --> 02:53:05.990 align:start position:0%
representative folsom
um

02:53:05.990 --> 02:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:53:08.150 --> 02:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
i think we all know there's several more
 
02:53:10.870 --> 02:53:10.880 align:start position:0%
bills coming down the pike
 
02:53:13.349 --> 02:53:13.359 align:start position:0%
and i think if people want to add some
 
02:53:15.269 --> 02:53:15.279 align:start position:0%
other amendments to those we can
 
02:53:18.389 --> 02:53:18.399 align:start position:0%
actually debate those issues
 
02:53:21.910 --> 02:53:21.920 align:start position:0%
with those amendments at that time
 
02:53:24.630 --> 02:53:24.640 align:start position:0%
and so that that is you know this isn't
 
02:53:26.790 --> 02:53:26.800 align:start position:0%
the last chance to fix other things in
 
02:53:28.469 --> 02:53:28.479 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
02:53:29.990 --> 02:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
that we might want to add to something
 
02:53:39.030 --> 02:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:40.710 --> 02:53:40.720 align:start position:0%
representative leon
 
02:53:41.990 --> 02:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:53:44.309 --> 02:53:44.319 align:start position:0%
one point that we don't want to miss is
 
02:53:46.389 --> 02:53:46.399 align:start position:0%
that when a woman who's been in one of
 
02:53:48.230 --> 02:53:48.240 align:start position:0%
those situations with rape or incest who
 
02:53:50.550 --> 02:53:50.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't seek care until 24 weeks
 
02:53:53.110 --> 02:53:53.120 align:start position:0%
we also need to appreciate the potential
 
02:53:54.710 --> 02:53:54.720 align:start position:0%
mental health issues from having a
 
02:53:57.190 --> 02:53:57.200 align:start position:0%
forced decision at that point so i agree
 
02:53:58.790 --> 02:53:58.800 align:start position:0%
with representative folsom that should
 
02:54:01.110 --> 02:54:01.120 align:start position:0%
be a larger separate discussion for one
 
02:54:02.710 --> 02:54:02.720 align:start position:0%
of the other candidates coming down the
 
02:54:05.190 --> 02:54:05.200 align:start position:0%
pipe later this simply addresses the
 
02:54:07.510 --> 02:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
largest contention in the current law
 
02:54:09.830 --> 02:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
and i think will give give a lot of
 
02:54:11.590 --> 02:54:11.600 align:start position:0%
comfort to people who are in this
 
02:54:25.670 --> 02:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:29.910 --> 02:54:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:33.190 --> 02:54:33.200 align:start position:0%
the question before us is the amendment

your time
 
02:57:42.070 --> 02:57:42.080 align:start position:0%
i've been a um
 
02:57:44.070 --> 02:57:44.080 align:start position:0%
kind of a libertarian on this issue for
 
02:57:45.910 --> 02:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
many years
 
02:57:47.190 --> 02:57:47.200 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:57:51.510 --> 02:57:51.520 align:start position:0%
i deeply believe in the woman's right to
 
02:57:52.870 --> 02:57:52.880 align:start position:0%
discuss with their doctor and make
 
02:57:55.030 --> 02:57:55.040 align:start position:0%
difficult decisions early on without
 
02:57:57.110 --> 02:57:57.120 align:start position:0%
government intervention
 
02:58:00.309 --> 02:58:00.319 align:start position:0%
i've also opposed the um
 
02:58:02.309 --> 02:58:02.319 align:start position:0%
the extreme
 
02:58:04.550 --> 02:58:04.560 align:start position:0%
parties on uh
 
02:58:07.510 --> 02:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
my side of the aisle who want to ban and
 
02:58:10.230 --> 02:58:10.240 align:start position:0%
criminalize abortion altogether
 
02:58:12.630 --> 02:58:12.640 align:start position:0%
i find what we're working on here
 
02:58:14.950 --> 02:58:14.960 align:start position:0%
um moving towards
 
02:58:14.960 --> 02:58:15.910 align:start position:0%
um moving towards
a

02:58:15.910 --> 02:58:15.920 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:58:17.990 --> 02:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
common sense solution to a vexing
 
02:58:19.830 --> 02:58:19.840 align:start position:0%
problem that we've been dealing with
 
02:58:21.590 --> 02:58:21.600 align:start position:0%
for decades
 
02:58:24.630 --> 02:58:24.640 align:start position:0%
the the bottom line is that
 
02:58:27.510 --> 02:58:27.520 align:start position:0%
we're addressing the rights
 
02:58:29.990 --> 02:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
of the baby and that's something that we
 
02:58:33.030 --> 02:58:33.040 align:start position:0%
haven't done much of and that's always
 
02:58:33.040 --> 02:58:33.990 align:start position:0%
haven't done much of and that's always
been

02:58:33.990 --> 02:58:34.000 align:start position:0%
been
 
02:58:36.710 --> 02:58:36.720 align:start position:0%
what i've wondered about was when do we
 
02:58:39.190 --> 02:58:39.200 align:start position:0%
when do we set the point where the baby
 
02:58:41.110 --> 02:58:41.120 align:start position:0%
actually has rights someone actually
 
02:58:44.710 --> 02:58:44.720 align:start position:0%
advocates for that that child and
 
02:58:47.110 --> 02:58:47.120 align:start position:0%
you know my wife and i were married for
 
02:58:49.190 --> 02:58:49.200 align:start position:0%
18 years before we had our first baby we
 
02:58:50.630 --> 02:58:50.640 align:start position:0%
tried for years and never happened we
 
02:58:52.469 --> 02:58:52.479 align:start position:0%
got married in 94 we had our first child
 
02:58:54.309 --> 02:58:54.319 align:start position:0%
in 2011.
 
02:58:56.550 --> 02:58:56.560 align:start position:0%
um so this is near and dear to my heart
 
02:58:58.630 --> 02:58:58.640 align:start position:0%
we couldn't have a kid and suddenly we
 
02:59:00.790 --> 02:59:00.800 align:start position:0%
have this this beautiful
 
02:59:03.510 --> 02:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
uh miracle in our lives
 
02:59:05.429 --> 02:59:05.439 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:59:07.590 --> 02:59:07.600 align:start position:0%
you know at the time i was i was my
 
02:59:10.550 --> 02:59:10.560 align:start position:0%
career was flourishing my wife was busy
 
02:59:12.070 --> 02:59:12.080 align:start position:0%
uh we could have made that decision to
 
02:59:13.910 --> 02:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
terminate the pregnancy and and we
 
02:59:16.150 --> 02:59:16.160 align:start position:0%
didn't but that was our decision to make
 
02:59:17.910 --> 02:59:17.920 align:start position:0%
in that period i wouldn't want the
 
02:59:19.429 --> 02:59:19.439 align:start position:0%
government to step in
 
02:59:21.910 --> 02:59:21.920 align:start position:0%
um we're basically
 
02:59:23.269 --> 02:59:23.279 align:start position:0%
we're moving in the right direction as
 
02:59:24.950 --> 02:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
far as what i feel is coming to a common
 
02:59:26.230 --> 02:59:26.240 align:start position:0%
sense solution
 
02:59:28.469 --> 02:59:28.479 align:start position:0%
both sides are giving up
 
02:59:29.990 --> 02:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
some core beliefs but that's what
 
02:59:31.990 --> 02:59:32.000 align:start position:0%
politics is about is coming to
 
02:59:33.750 --> 02:59:33.760 align:start position:0%
an agreement in
 
02:59:35.349 --> 02:59:35.359 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the middle and figuring it
 
02:59:37.110 --> 02:59:37.120 align:start position:0%
out so that i will be voting for this
 
02:59:38.710 --> 02:59:38.720 align:start position:0%
and i do look forward to other
 
02:59:40.870 --> 02:59:40.880 align:start position:0%
amendments down the road that which may
 
02:59:42.950 --> 02:59:42.960 align:start position:0%
address some of the issues that are in
 
02:59:45.910 --> 02:59:45.920 align:start position:0%
1609 that are being taken out from this
 
02:59:47.990 --> 02:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
but i will be voting yes for this thank
 
02:59:48.000 --> 02:59:49.349 align:start position:0%
but i will be voting yes for this thank
you

02:59:49.349 --> 02:59:49.359 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:59:57.030 --> 02:59:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:59.030 --> 02:59:59.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
03:00:01.110 --> 03:00:01.120 align:start position:0%
i must say representative i do think
 
03:00:01.120 --> 03:00:02.630 align:start position:0%
i must say representative i do think
that

03:00:02.630 --> 03:00:02.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:00:03.910 --> 03:00:03.920 align:start position:0%
even though i voted against the
 
03:00:05.830 --> 03:00:05.840 align:start position:0%
amendment i do think the amendment
 
03:00:07.590 --> 03:00:07.600 align:start position:0%
clears up some things that were quite
 
03:00:09.030 --> 03:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
troubling to me
 
03:00:11.349 --> 03:00:11.359 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't address one of the issues
 
03:00:12.870 --> 03:00:12.880 align:start position:0%
that's very troubling to me is somebody
 
03:00:14.550 --> 03:00:14.560 align:start position:0%
that worked for 50 years in the
 
03:00:17.429 --> 03:00:17.439 align:start position:0%
healthcare field and that is leaving in
 
03:00:22.630 --> 03:00:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:24.710 --> 03:00:24.720 align:start position:0%
penance yeah you know what i mean
 
03:00:27.670 --> 03:00:27.680 align:start position:0%
and that that i am very concerned
 
03:00:29.349 --> 03:00:29.359 align:start position:0%
because we're desperately trying to
 
03:00:31.510 --> 03:00:31.520 align:start position:0%
recruit more healthcare professionals in
 
03:00:32.950 --> 03:00:32.960 align:start position:0%
all fields to come to new hampshire
 
03:00:33.990 --> 03:00:34.000 align:start position:0%
right now
 
03:00:35.429 --> 03:00:35.439 align:start position:0%
in the mental health field but in all
 
03:00:37.110 --> 03:00:37.120 align:start position:0%
the other fields too and i think this is
 
03:00:38.630 --> 03:00:38.640 align:start position:0%
a disincentive
 
03:00:40.790 --> 03:00:40.800 align:start position:0%
for people that want to set that up
 
03:00:42.630 --> 03:00:42.640 align:start position:0%
and it'll really be a problem for people
 
03:00:45.190 --> 03:00:45.200 align:start position:0%
that are in obstetrics and gynecology to
 
03:00:46.790 --> 03:00:46.800 align:start position:0%
want to set up a practice here in new
 
03:00:48.230 --> 03:00:48.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire so
 
03:00:48.240 --> 03:00:48.870 align:start position:0%
hampshire so
if

03:00:48.870 --> 03:00:48.880 align:start position:0%
if
 
03:00:50.790 --> 03:00:50.800 align:start position:0%
if your amendment had included that i
 
03:00:52.469 --> 03:00:52.479 align:start position:0%
would have felt much more comfortable
 
03:00:54.070 --> 03:00:54.080 align:start position:0%
voting for it but
 
03:00:55.590 --> 03:00:55.600 align:start position:0%
that's the only reason but i do
 
03:00:57.670 --> 03:00:57.680 align:start position:0%
compliment you on your the thought and
 
03:00:59.429 --> 03:00:59.439 align:start position:0%
reasoning that went into making this
 
03:01:02.389 --> 03:01:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:05.269 --> 03:01:05.279 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
03:01:05.279 --> 03:01:06.469 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
representative

03:01:06.469 --> 03:01:06.479 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:01:06.479 --> 03:01:16.550 align:start position:0%
representative
mckay

03:01:16.550 --> 03:01:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:18.230 --> 03:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
you know one seems to be do it let me
 
03:01:21.510 --> 03:01:21.520 align:start position:0%
just say very loud i agreed with
 
03:01:23.429 --> 03:01:23.439 align:start position:0%
representative snow
 
03:01:26.070 --> 03:01:26.080 align:start position:0%
i was very concerned that there was so
 
03:01:26.080 --> 03:01:27.190 align:start position:0%
i was very concerned that there was so
little

03:01:27.190 --> 03:01:27.200 align:start position:0%
little
 
03:01:29.030 --> 03:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
testimony on
 
03:01:30.630 --> 03:01:30.640 align:start position:0%
the other side
 
03:01:33.750 --> 03:01:33.760 align:start position:0%
i won't say our side but the other side
 
03:01:33.760 --> 03:01:34.630 align:start position:0%
i won't say our side but the other side
and

03:01:34.630 --> 03:01:34.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:01:34.640 --> 03:01:35.510 align:start position:0%
and
i

03:01:35.510 --> 03:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
i
 
03:01:38.309 --> 03:01:38.319 align:start position:0%
i was aware that the chairman was going
 
03:01:40.870 --> 03:01:40.880 align:start position:0%
to bring this up but i think other
 
03:01:43.510 --> 03:01:43.520 align:start position:0%
members were not and probably
 
03:01:45.830 --> 03:01:45.840 align:start position:0%
part of the public was unaware of the
 
03:01:45.840 --> 03:01:46.710 align:start position:0%
part of the public was unaware of the
fact

03:01:46.710 --> 03:01:46.720 align:start position:0%
fact
 
03:01:48.630 --> 03:01:48.640 align:start position:0%
that this was going to be dealt with
 
03:01:48.640 --> 03:01:49.830 align:start position:0%
that this was going to be dealt with
today

03:01:49.830 --> 03:01:49.840 align:start position:0%
today
 
03:01:52.070 --> 03:01:52.080 align:start position:0%
so that i think it was a
 
03:01:53.990 --> 03:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
mistake to
 
03:01:56.150 --> 03:01:56.160 align:start position:0%
not hear in depth
 
03:01:58.309 --> 03:01:58.319 align:start position:0%
what we heard on the one side and not
 
03:02:00.830 --> 03:02:00.840 align:start position:0%
the other so i'm going to vote
 
03:02:05.269 --> 03:02:05.279 align:start position:0%
now representative merchant
 
03:02:07.910 --> 03:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
03:02:11.110 --> 03:02:11.120 align:start position:0%
i think the underlying
 
03:02:13.349 --> 03:02:13.359 align:start position:0%
bill itself when it was first passed is
 
03:02:15.750 --> 03:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
a fatal flaw in it
 
03:02:17.269 --> 03:02:17.279 align:start position:0%
what i'm trying to get to is we talk
 
03:02:19.269 --> 03:02:19.279 align:start position:0%
about the rights of a child we talk
 
03:02:20.630 --> 03:02:20.640 align:start position:0%
about the rights of the parents and
 
03:02:22.070 --> 03:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
rights of
 
03:02:24.389 --> 03:02:24.399 align:start position:0%
the mother and the parents
 
03:02:26.309 --> 03:02:26.319 align:start position:0%
what we don't talk about
 
03:02:28.630 --> 03:02:28.640 align:start position:0%
as a society
 
03:02:30.710 --> 03:02:30.720 align:start position:0%
by denying that choice for a mother when
 
03:02:31.670 --> 03:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
you have a
 
03:02:33.830 --> 03:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
child that has
 
03:02:36.150 --> 03:02:36.160 align:start position:0%
fetal abdominality
 
03:02:38.550 --> 03:02:38.560 align:start position:0%
what we don't talk about
 
03:02:40.389 --> 03:02:40.399 align:start position:0%
we haven't talked about
 
03:02:42.309 --> 03:02:42.319 align:start position:0%
is the fact that we
 
03:02:44.790 --> 03:02:44.800 align:start position:0%
don't take the time or the resources
 
03:02:47.670 --> 03:02:47.680 align:start position:0%
support that family financially
 
03:02:49.590 --> 03:02:49.600 align:start position:0%
we talked about the financial burden
 
03:02:52.710 --> 03:02:52.720 align:start position:0%
placed upon the parents
 
03:02:55.750 --> 03:02:55.760 align:start position:0%
but at the same time don't talk about
 
03:02:58.550 --> 03:02:58.560 align:start position:0%
how we support that burden
 
03:02:59.830 --> 03:02:59.840 align:start position:0%
so therefore
 
03:03:01.030 --> 03:03:01.040 align:start position:0%
even though
 
03:03:04.469 --> 03:03:04.479 align:start position:0%
essence the law has some merits to it
 
03:03:05.990 --> 03:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have the other side of the
 
03:03:09.349 --> 03:03:09.359 align:start position:0%
coin it's how to support that family and
 
03:03:11.750 --> 03:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
that child or their life
 
03:03:14.070 --> 03:03:14.080 align:start position:0%
financially take away the burden
 
03:03:16.389 --> 03:03:16.399 align:start position:0%
therefore because of that i will not
 
03:03:19.670 --> 03:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:21.510 --> 03:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
 
03:03:21.520 --> 03:03:26.790 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
shapiro

03:03:26.790 --> 03:03:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:29.830 --> 03:03:29.840 align:start position:0%
you know i want to say one thing
 
03:03:31.510 --> 03:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
after representative
 
03:03:33.990 --> 03:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
talked i thought
 
03:03:36.309 --> 03:03:36.319 align:start position:0%
i really appreciated him talking about
 
03:03:36.319 --> 03:03:38.870 align:start position:0%
i really appreciated him talking about
the

03:03:38.870 --> 03:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:41.269 --> 03:03:41.279 align:start position:0%
the value of his love of having children
 
03:03:42.790 --> 03:03:42.800 align:start position:0%
and i want to say that's something we
 
03:03:44.790 --> 03:03:44.800 align:start position:0%
can probably agree with from both sides
 
03:03:46.070 --> 03:03:46.080 align:start position:0%
here um
 
03:03:48.630 --> 03:03:48.640 align:start position:0%
certainly having my two daughters
 
03:03:50.150 --> 03:03:50.160 align:start position:0%
is the best thing that's happened to me
 
03:03:52.710 --> 03:03:52.720 align:start position:0%
in my life
 
03:03:55.990 --> 03:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
and having two grandchildren is um
 
03:04:00.150 --> 03:04:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:02.790 --> 03:04:02.800 align:start position:0%
so i think we can all agree about that
 
03:04:05.590 --> 03:04:05.600 align:start position:0%
wherever we come out on this particular
 
03:04:05.600 --> 03:04:07.510 align:start position:0%
wherever we come out on this particular
law

03:04:07.510 --> 03:04:07.520 align:start position:0%
law
 
03:04:10.630 --> 03:04:10.640 align:start position:0%
i think for me um
 
03:04:13.190 --> 03:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
we just heard about a fatal flaw and i
 
03:04:15.510 --> 03:04:15.520 align:start position:0%
look for the fatal flaw as the fact that
 
03:04:15.520 --> 03:04:16.630 align:start position:0%
look for the fatal flaw as the fact that
this

03:04:16.630 --> 03:04:16.640 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:04:19.269 --> 03:04:19.279 align:start position:0%
act originally was passed through the
 
03:04:21.590 --> 03:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
budget process instead of getting the
 
03:04:23.269 --> 03:04:23.279 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
03:04:25.190 --> 03:04:25.200 align:start position:0%
hearing and work on it
 
03:04:25.200 --> 03:04:26.150 align:start position:0%
hearing and work on it
that

03:04:26.150 --> 03:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:04:28.790 --> 03:04:28.800 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do right now
 
03:04:28.800 --> 03:04:30.070 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do right now
and

03:04:30.070 --> 03:04:30.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:04:31.670 --> 03:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
as the governor
 
03:04:35.750 --> 03:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:38.150 --> 03:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
he said he chose to sign this into law
 
03:04:40.230 --> 03:04:40.240 align:start position:0%
because it was part of the budget but he
 
03:04:41.670 --> 03:04:41.680 align:start position:0%
always thought we'd have the opportunity
 
03:04:43.670 --> 03:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
to come back and fix things
 
03:04:45.990 --> 03:04:46.000 align:start position:0%
and i'm just wondering
 
03:04:48.070 --> 03:04:48.080 align:start position:0%
why we're choosing to fix one thing and
 
03:04:51.510 --> 03:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
not fix the other things and
 
03:04:53.830 --> 03:04:53.840 align:start position:0%
i think we're missing an opportunity
 
03:04:53.840 --> 03:04:54.630 align:start position:0%
i think we're missing an opportunity
um

03:04:54.630 --> 03:04:54.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:04:57.110 --> 03:04:57.120 align:start position:0%
why not have
 
03:04:58.950 --> 03:04:58.960 align:start position:0%
the proposed amendment that we already
 
03:05:02.790 --> 03:05:02.800 align:start position:0%
passed with some of these other things
 
03:05:05.349 --> 03:05:05.359 align:start position:0%
so because we're choosing all to fix
 
03:05:07.590 --> 03:05:07.600 align:start position:0%
only one small piece and not the others
 
03:05:09.590 --> 03:05:09.600 align:start position:0%
that i think are really important i'm
 
03:05:12.070 --> 03:05:12.080 align:start position:0%
gonna vote no
 
03:05:14.389 --> 03:05:14.399 align:start position:0%
i would repeat that
 
03:05:16.389 --> 03:05:16.399 align:start position:0%
although i do not believe i'm required
 
03:05:19.990 --> 03:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
to do so i did inform the democrat
 
03:05:21.429 --> 03:05:21.439 align:start position:0%
ranking member
 
03:05:22.870 --> 03:05:22.880 align:start position:0%
several days ago
 
03:05:24.550 --> 03:05:24.560 align:start position:0%
that i would be executing this bill
 
03:05:26.389 --> 03:05:26.399 align:start position:0%
right after the hearing
 
03:05:29.269 --> 03:05:29.279 align:start position:0%
people could have found out
 
03:05:31.110 --> 03:05:31.120 align:start position:0%
representative mckay did
 
03:05:33.429 --> 03:05:33.439 align:start position:0%
and other amendments could have been
 
03:05:35.429 --> 03:05:35.439 align:start position:0%
put together and brought forward they
 
03:05:36.550 --> 03:05:36.560 align:start position:0%
were not
 
03:05:37.830 --> 03:05:37.840 align:start position:0%
other people
 
03:05:40.309 --> 03:05:40.319 align:start position:0%
could have come to testify i mean i like
 
03:05:42.469 --> 03:05:42.479 align:start position:0%
like most committee chairs to alternate
 
03:05:43.990 --> 03:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
one side and the other when i'm going
 
03:05:45.590 --> 03:05:45.600 align:start position:0%
through the pink cards
 
03:05:47.670 --> 03:05:47.680 align:start position:0%
that was not possible
 
03:05:47.680 --> 03:05:48.389 align:start position:0%
that was not possible
so

03:05:48.389 --> 03:05:48.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:05:50.150 --> 03:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
there we are but
 
03:05:51.990 --> 03:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
i have a very strong feeling and i think
 
03:05:54.150 --> 03:05:54.160 align:start position:0%
you'll all agree that we haven't heard
 
03:05:55.990 --> 03:05:56.000 align:start position:0%

is
 
03:35:04.150 --> 03:35:04.160 align:start position:0%

co-sponsors representative kathy rogers
 
03:35:09.750 --> 03:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
who would be here to testify today but i
 
03:35:11.429 --> 03:35:11.439 align:start position:0%
think you're all aware of her health
 
03:35:14.150 --> 03:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
issues i think she's probably streaming
 
03:35:15.269 --> 03:35:15.279 align:start position:0%
at home
 
03:35:17.990 --> 03:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
so little shout out to kathy
 
03:35:20.550 --> 03:35:20.560 align:start position:0%
and wishing her the best
 
03:35:22.389 --> 03:35:22.399 align:start position:0%
thank you now
 
03:35:24.630 --> 03:35:24.640 align:start position:0%
this bill is a pretty simple bill
 
03:35:27.750 --> 03:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
it just asks to include diabetes as a
 
03:35:31.830 --> 03:35:31.840 align:start position:0%
specific reason to use a service animal
 
03:35:35.190 --> 03:35:35.200 align:start position:0%
new hampshire law defines service animal
 
03:35:37.910 --> 03:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
as specifically dogs that are
 
03:35:40.870 --> 03:35:40.880 align:start position:0%
individually trained to perform services
 
03:35:42.389 --> 03:35:42.399 align:start position:0%
or tasks
 
03:35:44.710 --> 03:35:44.720 align:start position:0%
you should each have a copy of the rsa
 
03:35:44.720 --> 03:35:46.550 align:start position:0%
you should each have a copy of the rsa
167d

who is here with her dog sawyer
 
03:35:59.990 --> 03:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
asked me to file this bill because she
 
03:36:02.870 --> 03:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
did encounter some difficulties
 
03:36:04.550 --> 03:36:04.560 align:start position:0%

03:36:08.550 --> 03:36:08.560 align:start position:0%
she asked me to
 
03:36:10.630 --> 03:36:10.640 align:start position:0%
introduce the bill in hopes that it
 
03:36:13.190 --> 03:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
would help her and a lot of other people

who use these dogs for diabetes
 
03:36:18.870 --> 03:36:18.880 align:start position:0%
she'll testify shortly and describe her

interested in reading it
 
03:36:52.630 --> 03:36:52.640 align:start position:0%
i've also provided you with a partial
 
03:36:54.469 --> 03:36:54.479 align:start position:0%

you'll note on that handout in section 3
 
03:37:12.389 --> 03:37:12.399 align:start position:0%
it states one of the services performed
 
03:37:16.229 --> 03:37:16.239 align:start position:0%
would be alerting to low blood sugar and
 
03:37:19.110 --> 03:37:19.120 align:start position:0%
further down in section 7 it refers to
 
03:37:21.750 --> 03:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
the kinds of service dogs
 
03:37:24.710 --> 03:37:24.720 align:start position:0%

mr saya from the governor's council is
 
03:37:35.910 --> 03:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
here to answer any questions you may
 
03:37:38.790 --> 03:37:38.800 align:start position:0%
have about these articles
 
03:37:41.910 --> 03:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
the next item i provided for you is for
 
03:37:44.469 --> 03:37:44.479 align:start position:0%
eminem island cruises
 
03:37:46.950 --> 03:37:46.960 align:start position:0%
that may seem kind of an oddity
 
03:37:48.710 --> 03:37:48.720 align:start position:0%
but as you look at their mission
 
03:37:51.030 --> 03:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
statement you will see that the owner
 
03:37:53.830 --> 03:37:53.840 align:start position:0%
operator mr kevin morris
 
03:37:56.790 --> 03:37:56.800 align:start position:0%
started these boat cruises with the idea
 
03:37:59.349 --> 03:37:59.359 align:start position:0%
to use some of the proceeds to provide
 
03:38:03.269 --> 03:38:03.279 align:start position:0%
service dogs for children with diabetes
 
03:38:05.990 --> 03:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
this was done in memory of his daughter
 
03:38:09.750 --> 03:38:09.760 align:start position:0%
mandy who has passed from diabetes
 
03:38:12.309 --> 03:38:12.319 align:start position:0%
but whose last years of life were made
 
03:38:16.150 --> 03:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
more livable by use of her service dog
 
03:38:18.469 --> 03:38:18.479 align:start position:0%
mr morris could not make it today but i
 
03:38:21.030 --> 03:38:21.040 align:start position:0%
have enclosed a letter he has written
 
03:38:23.190 --> 03:38:23.200 align:start position:0%
about their experience
 
03:38:26.309 --> 03:38:26.319 align:start position:0%
his contact to provide dogs is
 
03:38:29.189 --> 03:38:29.199 align:start position:0%
guilford's golden guardians
 
03:38:32.469 --> 03:38:32.479 align:start position:0%
and carla weston was going to come today
 
03:38:34.550 --> 03:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
but she could not make it you also
 
03:38:37.510 --> 03:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
should have a letter from her
 
03:38:40.070 --> 03:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
providing some information about how
 
03:38:42.229 --> 03:38:42.239 align:start position:0%
they provide the dogs and provide for
 
03:38:42.239 --> 03:38:44.070 align:start position:0%
they provide the dogs and provide for
training

03:38:44.070 --> 03:38:44.080 align:start position:0%
training
 
03:38:46.070 --> 03:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
i understand that there's often a
 
03:38:49.830 --> 03:38:49.840 align:start position:0%
concern that adding one more item
 
03:38:52.469 --> 03:38:52.479 align:start position:0%
to lists of things that we authorize in
 
03:38:55.990 --> 03:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
the rsas opens the floodgates for others
 
03:38:58.150 --> 03:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
to be brought forward
 
03:39:01.750 --> 03:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
however i think the crime determinant

that's listed in rsa 162-2

roman 2
 
03:39:11.349 --> 03:39:11.359 align:start position:0%
just under our proposed edition
 
03:39:14.309 --> 03:39:14.319 align:start position:0%

03:39:18.790 --> 03:39:18.800 align:start position:0%
comfort or companionship
 
03:39:21.670 --> 03:39:21.680 align:start position:0%
would not allow more frivolous reasons
 
03:39:23.670 --> 03:39:23.680 align:start position:0%
to be added
 
03:39:27.110 --> 03:39:27.120 align:start position:0%
i would also say to those that question
 
03:39:29.429 --> 03:39:29.439 align:start position:0%
that dogs have been found to be capable
 
03:39:33.910 --> 03:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
of amazing sensibilities in recent years
 
03:39:36.550 --> 03:39:36.560 align:start position:0%
even alerting to types of cancer
 
03:39:38.550 --> 03:39:38.560 align:start position:0%
cardiac arrhythmias
 
03:39:40.150 --> 03:39:40.160 align:start position:0%
i would hope that this committee would
 
03:39:42.870 --> 03:39:42.880 align:start position:0%
be open to some of those possibilities
 
03:39:44.309 --> 03:39:44.319 align:start position:0%
in the future
 
03:39:45.429 --> 03:39:45.439 align:start position:0%
when that
 
03:39:45.439 --> 03:39:46.710 align:start position:0%
when that
particular

03:39:46.710 --> 03:39:46.720 align:start position:0%
particular
 
03:39:48.870 --> 03:39:48.880 align:start position:0%
trait has been proven
 
03:39:50.630 --> 03:39:50.640 align:start position:0%
but i also trust your wisdom to
 
03:39:54.309 --> 03:39:54.319 align:start position:0%
determine the worth of any new proposals
 
03:39:56.389 --> 03:39:56.399 align:start position:0%
i hope that you will agree that these
 
03:39:59.510 --> 03:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
diabetes alert dogs do perform a
 
03:40:01.189 --> 03:40:01.199 align:start position:0%
valuable service
 
03:40:04.389 --> 03:40:04.399 align:start position:0%
and deserve to be recognized in statute
 
03:40:06.309 --> 03:40:06.319 align:start position:0%
for their work
 
03:40:08.309 --> 03:40:08.319 align:start position:0%
in closing i'll tell you that there are
 
03:40:13.510 --> 03:40:13.520 align:start position:0%
approximately 97 000 diagnosed cases of
 
03:40:16.710 --> 03:40:16.720 align:start position:0%
diabetes in new hampshire
 
03:40:18.870 --> 03:40:18.880 align:start position:0%
and we feel that using an alert dog
 
03:40:21.510 --> 03:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
would help many of them deal with their
 
03:40:25.590 --> 03:40:25.600 align:start position:0%
disease more easily and accurately
 
03:40:27.950 --> 03:40:27.960 align:start position:0%
and just one more very
 
03:40:30.150 --> 03:40:30.160 align:start position:0%
unscientific reason
 
03:40:32.469 --> 03:40:32.479 align:start position:0%
to use one of these dogs
 
03:40:34.630 --> 03:40:34.640 align:start position:0%
we're all aware that one of the major

recommendations by health professionals
 
03:40:41.830 --> 03:40:41.840 align:start position:0%
for diabetics is to get regular exercise
 
03:40:44.550 --> 03:40:44.560 align:start position:0%
well you have to walk a dog a monitor
 
03:40:47.590 --> 03:40:47.600 align:start position:0%
does not make those demands
 
03:40:49.590 --> 03:40:49.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:40:51.510 --> 03:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
would you take some questions i
 
03:40:54.309 --> 03:40:54.319 align:start position:0%
certainly would if i can
 
03:40:55.670 --> 03:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
anyone with a question for the
 
03:40:55.680 --> 03:40:57.510 align:start position:0%
anyone with a question for the
representative

03:40:57.510 --> 03:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:41:01.830 --> 03:41:01.840 align:start position:0%
represent representative woods
 
03:41:03.349 --> 03:41:03.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and uh thank you
 
03:41:05.189 --> 03:41:05.199 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
03:41:07.990 --> 03:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
uh is there any sense of level
 
03:41:08.000 --> 03:41:08.870 align:start position:0%
uh is there any sense of level
of

03:41:08.870 --> 03:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:41:12.070 --> 03:41:12.080 align:start position:0%
aberrant glucose levels that the dogs
 
03:41:14.870 --> 03:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
can sense i mean
 
03:41:16.750 --> 03:41:16.760 align:start position:0%
being a physician
 
03:41:19.349 --> 03:41:19.359 align:start position:0%
ketoacidosis is one level
 
03:41:22.070 --> 03:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
but most of the damage in physiologic
 
03:41:24.950 --> 03:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
damage is done when it's just over
 
03:41:28.550 --> 03:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
uh but not out of control
 
03:41:30.309 --> 03:41:30.319 align:start position:0%
is there any
 
03:41:32.229 --> 03:41:32.239 align:start position:0%
information about what level they're
 
03:41:34.550 --> 03:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
able to sense i'm not sure that i have
 
03:41:38.389 --> 03:41:38.399 align:start position:0%
the expertise to answer but we have
 
03:41:40.710 --> 03:41:40.720 align:start position:0%
three people who use the dogs
 
03:41:43.349 --> 03:41:43.359 align:start position:0%
plus one lady who provides dogs and i
 
03:41:45.429 --> 03:41:45.439 align:start position:0%
think they can probably address that
 
03:41:48.070 --> 03:41:48.080 align:start position:0%
question better
 
03:41:50.550 --> 03:41:50.560 align:start position:0%
i think we should introduce our canine
 
03:41:50.560 --> 03:41:54.469 align:start position:0%
i think we should introduce our canine
guests

03:41:54.469 --> 03:41:54.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:55.910 --> 03:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
we have
 
03:41:58.630 --> 03:41:58.640 align:start position:0%
of course coach
 
03:41:58.640 --> 03:42:00.389 align:start position:0%

if from maine
 
03:42:09.189 --> 03:42:09.199 align:start position:0%
there was a question about whether they
 
03:42:12.229 --> 03:42:12.239 align:start position:0%
should be allowed here um i asked
 
03:42:13.990 --> 03:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
the powers that be if each could be
 
03:42:16.710 --> 03:42:16.720 align:start position:0%
given a day pass
 
03:42:18.389 --> 03:42:18.399 align:start position:0%
and i want to make sure that the water
 
03:42:21.510 --> 03:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
bowls have been delivered and treats and
 
03:42:25.429 --> 03:42:25.439 align:start position:0%
all that okay i mean good
 
03:42:27.750 --> 03:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
any further questions for representative

03:43:02.870 --> 03:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
well thank you members of the committee
 
03:43:05.110 --> 03:43:05.120 align:start position:0%
it's an honor to be before you today to
 
03:43:07.189 --> 03:43:07.199 align:start position:0%
testify on behalf of this bill
 
03:43:08.870 --> 03:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
special thanks to representative schuett
 
03:43:11.110 --> 03:43:11.120 align:start position:0%
and representative rogers at home
 
03:43:13.510 --> 03:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
for bringing this before you
 
03:43:15.990 --> 03:43:16.000 align:start position:0%
as we've said this is coach and my
 
03:43:18.150 --> 03:43:18.160 align:start position:0%
eldest daughter ellie ellie lives with
 
03:43:23.830 --> 03:43:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:25.269 --> 03:43:25.279 align:start position:0%
and she's been living with this
 
03:43:28.550 --> 03:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
diagnosis since she was just 8 years old
 
03:43:31.189 --> 03:43:31.199 align:start position:0%
coach came to our family when she had
 
03:43:31.199 --> 03:43:31.990 align:start position:0%
coach came to our family when she had
been

03:43:31.990 --> 03:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
been
 
03:43:34.469 --> 03:43:34.479 align:start position:0%
about 5 years in into progression of the
 
03:43:37.030 --> 03:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
disease for those of you who don't know
 
03:43:39.590 --> 03:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes are
 
03:43:39.600 --> 03:43:40.630 align:start position:0%
type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes are
different

03:43:40.630 --> 03:43:40.640 align:start position:0%
different
 
03:43:42.790 --> 03:43:42.800 align:start position:0%
type 1 is an autoimmune disease it means
 
03:43:45.110 --> 03:43:45.120 align:start position:0%
your body does not produce any insulin
 
03:43:47.429 --> 03:43:47.439 align:start position:0%
so you have no ability to regulate high
 
03:43:48.870 --> 03:43:48.880 align:start position:0%
and low blood sugars
 
03:43:50.790 --> 03:43:50.800 align:start position:0%
for all of us who don't have the
 
03:43:52.229 --> 03:43:52.239 align:start position:0%
challenge of living with diabetes our
 
03:43:54.550 --> 03:43:54.560 align:start position:0%
pancreas does that work for us so as
 
03:43:56.710 --> 03:43:56.720 align:start position:0%
you're thinking about digesting lunch
 
03:43:58.389 --> 03:43:58.399 align:start position:0%
your pancreas is doing all that work for
 
03:44:00.150 --> 03:44:00.160 align:start position:0%
you without any decision making at all
 
03:44:02.469 --> 03:44:02.479 align:start position:0%
on your part unfortunately because ellie
 
03:44:04.150 --> 03:44:04.160 align:start position:0%
has to live with
 
03:44:06.070 --> 03:44:06.080 align:start position:0%
continuous dosing of insulin she's
 
03:44:08.630 --> 03:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
making constant decisions about whether
 
03:44:11.030 --> 03:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
she needs more sugar or more insulin or
 
03:44:13.750 --> 03:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
more food and how to handle activity
 
03:44:15.750 --> 03:44:15.760 align:start position:0%
and for a growing young person it's
 
03:44:17.429 --> 03:44:17.439 align:start position:0%
quite a challenge to handle all of those
 
03:44:17.439 --> 03:44:18.630 align:start position:0%
quite a challenge to handle all of those
variables

03:44:18.630 --> 03:44:18.640 align:start position:0%
variables
 
03:44:21.429 --> 03:44:21.439 align:start position:0%
coach is a medical alert dog he was
 
03:44:23.670 --> 03:44:23.680 align:start position:0%
trained in a correctional facility in
 
03:44:23.680 --> 03:44:24.950 align:start position:0%
trained in a correctional facility in
kansas

03:44:24.950 --> 03:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
kansas
 
03:44:26.710 --> 03:44:26.720 align:start position:0%
and brought to our family through a
 
03:44:29.510 --> 03:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
non-profit organization called cares
 
03:44:32.309 --> 03:44:32.319 align:start position:0%
uh he's actually
 
03:44:34.630 --> 03:44:34.640 align:start position:0%
been by the time we received him in our
 
03:44:37.110 --> 03:44:37.120 align:start position:0%
family he was about 18 months old and he
 
03:44:39.830 --> 03:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
had already had 2 000 hours of training
 
03:44:41.990 --> 03:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
he had been on a plane five times before
 
03:44:43.510 --> 03:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
we even met him
 
03:44:45.110 --> 03:44:45.120 align:start position:0%
does he fly coach
 
03:44:45.120 --> 03:44:45.910 align:start position:0%
does he fly coach
yes

03:44:45.910 --> 03:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:44:45.920 --> 03:44:46.950 align:start position:0%
yes
always

03:44:46.950 --> 03:44:46.960 align:start position:0%
always
 
03:44:48.790 --> 03:44:48.800 align:start position:0%
he can make himself very small you'd be
 
03:44:48.800 --> 03:44:50.950 align:start position:0%
he can make himself very small you'd be
amazed

03:44:50.950 --> 03:44:50.960 align:start position:0%
amazed
 
03:44:53.910 --> 03:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
and in order for ellie and coach to be a
 
03:44:56.309 --> 03:44:56.319 align:start position:0%
team a training team they actually went
 
03:44:58.630 --> 03:44:58.640 align:start position:0%
through a week-long training together
 
03:45:00.870 --> 03:45:00.880 align:start position:0%
and had to be certified through a public
 
03:45:03.429 --> 03:45:03.439 align:start position:0%
access test process
 
03:45:04.469 --> 03:45:04.479 align:start position:0%
so that
 
03:45:06.389 --> 03:45:06.399 align:start position:0%
the trainers and the handlers could be
 
03:45:08.150 --> 03:45:08.160 align:start position:0%
assured that she had the capacity to
 
03:45:10.630 --> 03:45:10.640 align:start position:0%
manage him on her own
 
03:45:10.640 --> 03:45:11.429 align:start position:0%
manage him on her own
he's

03:45:11.429 --> 03:45:11.439 align:start position:0%
he's
 
03:45:12.870 --> 03:45:12.880 align:start position:0%
joined our family when she was in eighth
 
03:45:15.269 --> 03:45:15.279 align:start position:0%
grade he's seen her through high school
 
03:45:17.110 --> 03:45:17.120 align:start position:0%
and college she just graduated college
 
03:45:19.510 --> 03:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
and she'll she'll share her own words
 
03:45:21.590 --> 03:45:21.600 align:start position:0%
about that experience but as her mother
 
03:45:24.389 --> 03:45:24.399 align:start position:0%
what i can share with you is that
 
03:45:26.550 --> 03:45:26.560 align:start position:0%
managing type 1 diabetes is a constant
 
03:45:28.389 --> 03:45:28.399 align:start position:0%
chronic challenge
 
03:45:28.399 --> 03:45:29.590 align:start position:0%
chronic challenge
and

03:45:29.590 --> 03:45:29.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:45:31.750 --> 03:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
as you heard one of your fellow members
 
03:45:33.349 --> 03:45:33.359 align:start position:0%
of the committee ask
 
03:45:35.429 --> 03:45:35.439 align:start position:0%
you're constantly trying to achieve a
 
03:45:38.070 --> 03:45:38.080 align:start position:0%
blood glucose range that's healthy and
 
03:45:39.990 --> 03:45:40.000 align:start position:0%
in ellie's case it's somewhere between
 
03:45:42.469 --> 03:45:42.479 align:start position:0%
no lower than a blood sugar of 70 and no
 
03:45:45.429 --> 03:45:45.439 align:start position:0%
higher than about 150.
 
03:45:47.910 --> 03:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
so coach is trained to alert when he can
 
03:45:49.750 --> 03:45:49.760 align:start position:0%
detect her blood sugar levels dropping
 
03:45:53.510 --> 03:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
below 70 or above 150. he alerts in a
 
03:45:55.750 --> 03:45:55.760 align:start position:0%
bunch of different ways
 
03:45:58.630 --> 03:45:58.640 align:start position:0%
he often will pot her lap if she were
 
03:46:01.349 --> 03:46:01.359 align:start position:0%
in a class right now at school and
 
03:46:03.349 --> 03:46:03.359 align:start position:0%
not feeling well high or low he would
 
03:46:05.510 --> 03:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
stand up he would circle her chair or he
 
03:46:07.189 --> 03:46:07.199 align:start position:0%
would pot her lap to get her attention
 
03:46:09.269 --> 03:46:09.279 align:start position:0%
so she would test her blood sugar
 
03:46:11.349 --> 03:46:11.359 align:start position:0%
he's done that for her now for
 
03:46:12.630 --> 03:46:12.640 align:start position:0%
eight years
 
03:46:12.640 --> 03:46:14.870 align:start position:0%
eight years
and

03:46:14.870 --> 03:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:46:16.630 --> 03:46:16.640 align:start position:0%
the difference has really been
 
03:46:18.309 --> 03:46:18.319 align:start position:0%
extraordinary i mean i can tell you i
 
03:46:19.830 --> 03:46:19.840 align:start position:0%
was i was very cynical about whether
 
03:46:22.630 --> 03:46:22.640 align:start position:0%
these dogs could actually work
 
03:46:25.349 --> 03:46:25.359 align:start position:0%
i'm a technical person i like to see
 
03:46:27.990 --> 03:46:28.000 align:start position:0%
data i'm a business person
 
03:46:28.000 --> 03:46:28.870 align:start position:0%
data i'm a business person
and

03:46:28.870 --> 03:46:28.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:46:31.670 --> 03:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
in the first week i was awoken in the
 
03:46:34.070 --> 03:46:34.080 align:start position:0%
middle of the night with paws on my
 
03:46:34.080 --> 03:46:35.830 align:start position:0%
middle of the night with paws on my
chest

03:46:35.830 --> 03:46:35.840 align:start position:0%
chest
 
03:46:37.590 --> 03:46:37.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't wake up with low blood sugars
 
03:46:40.070 --> 03:46:40.080 align:start position:0%
which is another risk to her safety
 
03:46:40.080 --> 03:46:40.950 align:start position:0%
which is another risk to her safety
and

03:46:40.950 --> 03:46:40.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:46:43.110 --> 03:46:43.120 align:start position:0%
i i felt the dog on my chest and i was
 
03:46:44.469 --> 03:46:44.479 align:start position:0%
still a little disoriented he was still
 
03:46:46.550 --> 03:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
new to our family and i thought
 
03:46:49.030 --> 03:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
maybe he needs to go out or maybe he's
 
03:46:50.630 --> 03:46:50.640 align:start position:0%
you know bothered by some noise he heard
 
03:46:52.870 --> 03:46:52.880 align:start position:0%
in the house and sure enough you know i
 
03:46:54.630 --> 03:46:54.640 align:start position:0%
went into her bedroom and
 
03:46:56.229 --> 03:46:56.239 align:start position:0%
and her blood sugar was very low and i
 
03:46:58.070 --> 03:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
didn't know it and she was sound asleep
 
03:47:00.070 --> 03:47:00.080 align:start position:0%
and the dog was alerting us to that
 
03:47:02.950 --> 03:47:02.960 align:start position:0%
reality um he really has
 
03:47:05.750 --> 03:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
in terms of thinking about her safety
 
03:47:08.389 --> 03:47:08.399 align:start position:0%
living independently in college she was
 
03:47:10.469 --> 03:47:10.479 align:start position:0%
in a single dorm you can imagine with
 
03:47:10.479 --> 03:47:11.590 align:start position:0%
in a single dorm you can imagine with
kovid

03:47:11.590 --> 03:47:11.600 align:start position:0%
kovid
 
03:47:14.070 --> 03:47:14.080 align:start position:0%
the isolation that all students were
 
03:47:16.309 --> 03:47:16.319 align:start position:0%
feeling and to have her be alone all the
 
03:47:18.469 --> 03:47:18.479 align:start position:0%
time without that added support
 
03:47:19.750 --> 03:47:19.760 align:start position:0%
really would just have been an
 
03:47:22.309 --> 03:47:22.319 align:start position:0%
unbearable burden for her and and worry
 
03:47:23.910 --> 03:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
for our family so
 
03:47:26.389 --> 03:47:26.399 align:start position:0%
we're very much in favor of this bill
 
03:47:28.550 --> 03:47:28.560 align:start position:0%
we believe that anyone who wants to
 
03:47:30.790 --> 03:47:30.800 align:start position:0%
handle the responsibility of a dog and
 
03:47:32.870 --> 03:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
have the added benefit of the support
 
03:47:34.790 --> 03:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
these animals can provide to people who
 
03:47:36.950 --> 03:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
are living with chronic disease should
 
03:47:39.429 --> 03:47:39.439 align:start position:0%
should be able to access them
 
03:47:41.510 --> 03:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
we've seen firsthand he's gone in
 
03:47:43.189 --> 03:47:43.199 align:start position:0%
restaurants he's gone to movie theaters
 
03:47:45.429 --> 03:47:45.439 align:start position:0%
he's gone on airplanes he's been in the
 
03:47:47.189 --> 03:47:47.199 align:start position:0%
hospital with her when she's been in the
 
03:47:50.070 --> 03:47:50.080 align:start position:0%
hospital for complications he lived with
 
03:47:52.870 --> 03:47:52.880 align:start position:0%
her in her dorm room in college
 
03:47:55.030 --> 03:47:55.040 align:start position:0%
and it's a seamless part of their
 
03:47:57.030 --> 03:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
day-to-day life and he's provided the
 
03:48:00.550 --> 03:48:00.560 align:start position:0%
added benefit and security of knowing
 
03:48:02.070 --> 03:48:02.080 align:start position:0%
there's one other
 
03:48:04.790 --> 03:48:04.800 align:start position:0%
person energy animal in the mix to help
 
03:48:05.990 --> 03:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
support her
 
03:48:09.590 --> 03:48:09.600 align:start position:0%
so with that i'll turn it over to you al
 
03:48:12.710 --> 03:48:12.720 align:start position:0%
hi hello my name is ellie shaheen
 
03:48:12.720 --> 03:48:13.510 align:start position:0%
hi hello my name is ellie shaheen
um

03:48:13.510 --> 03:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:48:16.630 --> 03:48:16.640 align:start position:0%
i'll just say a few words after my mom
 
03:48:19.590 --> 03:48:19.600 align:start position:0%
but um coach has been with me since i
 
03:48:23.349 --> 03:48:23.359 align:start position:0%
was 13 years old he's been with me for
 
03:48:25.590 --> 03:48:25.600 align:start position:0%
some of the most formative years of my
 
03:48:27.670 --> 03:48:27.680 align:start position:0%
life through high school and through all
 
03:48:29.030 --> 03:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
of college
 
03:48:31.990 --> 03:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
and i know for me and for my mom he's
 
03:48:34.790 --> 03:48:34.800 align:start position:0%
helped me navigate living on my own for
 
03:48:37.510 --> 03:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
the first time and making sure that my
 
03:48:39.269 --> 03:48:39.279 align:start position:0%
safety was
 
03:48:41.189 --> 03:48:41.199 align:start position:0%
assured especially during the night time
 
03:48:43.030 --> 03:48:43.040 align:start position:0%
like my mom said
 
03:48:46.469 --> 03:48:46.479 align:start position:0%
when we first got him i know that my mom
 
03:48:46.479 --> 03:48:47.429 align:start position:0%
when we first got him i know that my mom
couldn't

03:48:47.429 --> 03:48:47.439 align:start position:0%
couldn't
 
03:48:49.830 --> 03:48:49.840 align:start position:0%
see a reality in which i could go to
 
03:48:52.309 --> 03:48:52.319 align:start position:0%
college on my own because i didn't wake
 
03:48:54.469 --> 03:48:54.479 align:start position:0%
up in the middle of the night
 
03:48:56.229 --> 03:48:56.239 align:start position:0%
with a low blood sugar or a high blood
 
03:48:59.510 --> 03:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
sugar alert um so
 
03:49:02.309 --> 03:49:02.319 align:start position:0%
understanding that we could have coach
 
03:49:05.189 --> 03:49:05.199 align:start position:0%
in my life and that he could alert me
 
03:49:07.590 --> 03:49:07.600 align:start position:0%
if i were to live with somebody or not
 
03:49:10.070 --> 03:49:10.080 align:start position:0%
and that i could be okay without my mom
 
03:49:12.309 --> 03:49:12.319 align:start position:0%
or my other family members being there
 
03:49:15.590 --> 03:49:15.600 align:start position:0%
has been a literal lifesaver more than
 
03:49:15.600 --> 03:49:17.110 align:start position:0%
has been a literal lifesaver more than
once

03:49:17.110 --> 03:49:17.120 align:start position:0%
once
 
03:49:20.469 --> 03:49:20.479 align:start position:0%
and just reiterating what my mom said
 
03:49:22.790 --> 03:49:22.800 align:start position:0%
anyone who would want the responsibility
 
03:49:24.550 --> 03:49:24.560 align:start position:0%
of living with a service dog should be
 
03:49:25.750 --> 03:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
able to
 
03:49:29.590 --> 03:49:29.600 align:start position:0%
access them in whatever capacity
 
03:49:31.990 --> 03:49:32.000 align:start position:0%
would you take a question ellie
 
03:49:34.389 --> 03:49:34.399 align:start position:0%
yes did you have a glucose monitor
 
03:49:37.429 --> 03:49:37.439 align:start position:0%
before coach showed up yesterday
 
03:49:40.229 --> 03:49:40.239 align:start position:0%
and contrast for us sure um
 
03:49:42.790 --> 03:49:42.800 align:start position:0%
there's really no comparing contrast
 
03:49:45.349 --> 03:49:45.359 align:start position:0%
between the dogs and the technology
 
03:49:47.269 --> 03:49:47.279 align:start position:0%
there's no way to
 
03:49:47.279 --> 03:49:49.429 align:start position:0%
there's no way to
um

03:49:49.429 --> 03:49:49.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:49:53.590 --> 03:49:53.600 align:start position:0%
tell if they're any different uh
 
03:49:55.189 --> 03:49:55.199 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm not sure if i'm being very
 
03:49:58.870 --> 03:49:58.880 align:start position:0%
eloquent with this apologies but um
 
03:50:02.389 --> 03:50:02.399 align:start position:0%
that you're not using one over the other
 
03:50:06.070 --> 03:50:06.080 align:start position:0%
necessarily um i know any other diabetic
 
03:50:08.790 --> 03:50:08.800 align:start position:0%
that uses a dog is also using technology
 
03:50:10.309 --> 03:50:10.319 align:start position:0%
alongside it
 
03:50:13.750 --> 03:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
the dog is just an aide and a support
 
03:50:14.870 --> 03:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
to help
 
03:50:17.670 --> 03:50:17.680 align:start position:0%
you not just emotionally but also like i
 
03:50:19.510 --> 03:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
said alerting
 
03:50:22.150 --> 03:50:22.160 align:start position:0%
in the night time the technology is also
 
03:50:24.309 --> 03:50:24.319 align:start position:0%
never a hundred percent right
 
03:50:27.349 --> 03:50:27.359 align:start position:0%
um so the dog helps in in that capacity
 
03:50:28.389 --> 03:50:28.399 align:start position:0%
as well
 
03:50:30.389 --> 03:50:30.399 align:start position:0%
does the dog help you screen out
 
03:50:32.950 --> 03:50:32.960 align:start position:0%
potential boyfriends yeah yeah
 
03:50:34.550 --> 03:50:34.560 align:start position:0%
yes we actually have some pretty funny
 
03:50:37.110 --> 03:50:37.120 align:start position:0%
stories about some field trips that he
 
03:50:39.189 --> 03:50:39.199 align:start position:0%
got himself in the middle of her with
 
03:50:41.750 --> 03:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
some other boys he's featured in many
 
03:50:43.670 --> 03:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
you know many yearbooks i i the
 
03:50:45.110 --> 03:50:45.120 align:start position:0%
technology question is one i just also
 
03:50:46.710 --> 03:50:46.720 align:start position:0%
want to elaborate on because it comes up
 
03:50:48.790 --> 03:50:48.800 align:start position:0%
all the time and when coach first
 
03:50:50.229 --> 03:50:50.239 align:start position:0%
arrived the technology was more
 
03:50:51.990 --> 03:50:52.000 align:start position:0%
rudimentary this you know was over eight
 
03:50:54.870 --> 03:50:54.880 align:start position:0%
years ago and that she's now using
 
03:50:56.790 --> 03:50:56.800 align:start position:0%
technology that's that's very different
 
03:50:56.800 --> 03:50:57.670 align:start position:0%
technology that's that's very different
that's

03:50:57.670 --> 03:50:57.680 align:start position:0%
that's
 
03:51:00.389 --> 03:51:00.399 align:start position:0%
better more accurate more effective
 
03:51:02.710 --> 03:51:02.720 align:start position:0%
that said you know it's really worth
 
03:51:04.790 --> 03:51:04.800 align:start position:0%
reinforcing that for some people the
 
03:51:07.269 --> 03:51:07.279 align:start position:0%
technology is not optimal it's it's a
 
03:51:09.110 --> 03:51:09.120 align:start position:0%
lot of beeping it's you're attached
 
03:51:11.110 --> 03:51:11.120 align:start position:0%
constantly she wears a continuous
 
03:51:13.349 --> 03:51:13.359 align:start position:0%
glucose monitor and an insulin pump all
 
03:51:15.990 --> 03:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
the time attached to her body 24 7. she
 
03:51:17.990 --> 03:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
also has alarm fatigue because she's so
 
03:51:19.590 --> 03:51:19.600 align:start position:0%
accustomed to hearing the alarms that
 
03:51:21.830 --> 03:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
the alarms actually don't wake her up
 
03:51:24.229 --> 03:51:24.239 align:start position:0%
so you know we actually have a as a
 
03:51:27.030 --> 03:51:27.040 align:start position:0%
backup to coach and to her existing
 
03:51:29.269 --> 03:51:29.279 align:start position:0%
alarms we have another series of alarms
 
03:51:32.229 --> 03:51:32.239 align:start position:0%
that i can alert remotely if she's away
 
03:51:34.389 --> 03:51:34.399 align:start position:0%
and has to have that happen so um you
 
03:51:35.269 --> 03:51:35.279 align:start position:0%
know that
 
03:51:37.429 --> 03:51:37.439 align:start position:0%
we would never say one over the other
 
03:51:39.830 --> 03:51:39.840 align:start position:0%
it's a combination of of whatever
 
03:51:41.990 --> 03:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
sources you can access to best support
 
03:51:43.349 --> 03:51:43.359 align:start position:0%
you and keep you safe
 
03:51:45.269 --> 03:51:45.279 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
03:51:46.870 --> 03:51:46.880 align:start position:0%
for mother and daughter
 
03:51:48.710 --> 03:51:48.720 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
03:51:50.550 --> 03:51:50.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you both
 
03:51:52.950 --> 03:51:52.960 align:start position:0%
for being here and answering questions i
 
03:51:54.710 --> 03:51:54.720 align:start position:0%
actually was a medical device analyst
 
03:51:56.710 --> 03:51:56.720 align:start position:0%
covering diabetes technology companies
 
03:51:58.870 --> 03:51:58.880 align:start position:0%
since before your diagnosis
 
03:52:01.590 --> 03:52:01.600 align:start position:0%
and i appreciate those challenges and
 
03:52:04.150 --> 03:52:04.160 align:start position:0%
um i do understand that you're in that
 
03:52:06.309 --> 03:52:06.319 align:start position:0%
area where it's a lot harder to manage
 
03:52:08.630 --> 03:52:08.640 align:start position:0%
it with just technology but my question
 
03:52:08.640 --> 03:52:09.510 align:start position:0%
it with just technology but my question
is

03:52:09.510 --> 03:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:52:11.269 --> 03:52:11.279 align:start position:0%
seeing that you have both a pump and a
 
03:52:13.750 --> 03:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
sensor are you able to move closer to
 
03:52:15.510 --> 03:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
that integration because your dog will
 
03:52:17.990 --> 03:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
let you know if that balance between the
 
03:52:24.229 --> 03:52:24.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:25.429 --> 03:52:25.439 align:start position:0%
can you sorry can you trust your
 
03:52:27.510 --> 03:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
technology more since you have you have
 
03:52:30.550 --> 03:52:30.560 align:start position:0%
coach to back you up oh yeah yeah i mean
 
03:52:32.229 --> 03:52:32.239 align:start position:0%
it's funny i've there been times when
 
03:52:34.309 --> 03:52:34.319 align:start position:0%
all he's alerting this actually happened
 
03:52:36.150 --> 03:52:36.160 align:start position:0%
two nights ago at dinner ellie would
 
03:52:38.550 --> 03:52:38.560 align:start position:0%
normally uh be back in new york now
 
03:52:40.070 --> 03:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
because she just graduated from college
 
03:52:42.229 --> 03:52:42.239 align:start position:0%
but because of the omicron surge she's
 
03:52:44.950 --> 03:52:44.960 align:start position:0%
taking a little more time closer to home
 
03:52:47.510 --> 03:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
but she was home for dinner and
 
03:52:48.950 --> 03:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
he was alerting
 
03:52:50.710 --> 03:52:50.720 align:start position:0%
and her
 
03:52:52.950 --> 03:52:52.960 align:start position:0%
phone wasn't alarming and
 
03:52:54.870 --> 03:52:54.880 align:start position:0%
we have share capabilities so my phone
 
03:52:56.309 --> 03:52:56.319 align:start position:0%
alarms also
 
03:52:56.319 --> 03:52:57.269 align:start position:0%
alarms also
backup

03:52:57.269 --> 03:52:57.279 align:start position:0%
backup
 
03:52:57.279 --> 03:52:58.309 align:start position:0%
backup
and

03:52:58.309 --> 03:52:58.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:53:00.229 --> 03:53:00.239 align:start position:0%
we said well he's alerting
 
03:53:01.990 --> 03:53:02.000 align:start position:0%
oma my phone's not alarming but he's
 
03:53:03.670 --> 03:53:03.680 align:start position:0%
alerting and then you look at at the
 
03:53:05.830 --> 03:53:05.840 align:start position:0%
trend and the arrows headed up so he's
 
03:53:07.990 --> 03:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
catching it as it's on its way up before
 
03:53:10.630 --> 03:53:10.640 align:start position:0%
the technology necessarily registers it
 
03:53:12.550 --> 03:53:12.560 align:start position:0%
um and i say
 
03:53:15.269 --> 03:53:15.279 align:start position:0%
because she's seen so many evolutions of
 
03:53:17.189 --> 03:53:17.199 align:start position:0%
different devices
 
03:53:19.110 --> 03:53:19.120 align:start position:0%
before we got coach she tried a glucose
 
03:53:21.349 --> 03:53:21.359 align:start position:0%
monitor and the technology was so tough
 
03:53:23.269 --> 03:53:23.279 align:start position:0%
then that it was alarming her every
 
03:53:24.950 --> 03:53:24.960 align:start position:0%
other minute in class and it was very
 
03:53:27.030 --> 03:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
disruptive and distracting
 
03:53:29.110 --> 03:53:29.120 align:start position:0%
it's gotten much much better now
 
03:53:30.309 --> 03:53:30.319 align:start position:0%
but i think as you point out the
 
03:53:32.870 --> 03:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
combination of the dog reinforcing the
 
03:53:34.150 --> 03:53:34.160 align:start position:0%
messaging she's getting from the
 
03:53:36.710 --> 03:53:36.720 align:start position:0%
technology is helpful and then also just
 
03:53:38.389 --> 03:53:38.399 align:start position:0%
i mean this is a
 
03:53:40.550 --> 03:53:40.560 align:start position:0%
personal note as her mother
 
03:53:42.550 --> 03:53:42.560 align:start position:0%
before coach
 
03:53:44.790 --> 03:53:44.800 align:start position:0%
i was all it was always about diabetes
 
03:53:47.510 --> 03:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
and i was her nurse it was always you
 
03:53:48.950 --> 03:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
know are you high are you low have you
 
03:53:50.870 --> 03:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
tested did you take enough insulin for
 
03:53:52.870 --> 03:53:52.880 align:start position:0%
that what what's your number
 
03:53:55.590 --> 03:53:55.600 align:start position:0%
and it created friction and frustration
 
03:53:57.269 --> 03:53:57.279 align:start position:0%
on her part you know there's so much
 
03:53:59.750 --> 03:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
emphasis on the diabetes when coach
 
03:54:01.590 --> 03:54:01.600 align:start position:0%
arrived it became about her relationship
 
03:54:02.870 --> 03:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
to him
 
03:54:04.870 --> 03:54:04.880 align:start position:0%
and so when he was alarming her or
 
03:54:06.150 --> 03:54:06.160 align:start position:0%
alerting her
 
03:54:08.469 --> 03:54:08.479 align:start position:0%
she wanted to reward him if he was right
 
03:54:10.469 --> 03:54:10.479 align:start position:0%
and it was about him it wasn't about the
 
03:54:12.389 --> 03:54:12.399 align:start position:0%
diabetes and i do think that's a
 
03:54:15.830 --> 03:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
powerful part of this dynamic that has
 
03:54:18.389 --> 03:54:18.399 align:start position:0%
made her the quality of her life better
 
03:54:19.910 --> 03:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
because it's about her relationship to
 
03:54:22.229 --> 03:54:22.239 align:start position:0%
him more so than it's about the diabetes
 
03:54:24.469 --> 03:54:24.479 align:start position:0%
demanding that she do something or the
 
03:54:27.429 --> 03:54:27.439 align:start position:0%
mom who's now feeling like the nurse
 
03:54:29.510 --> 03:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
causing friction and frustration
 
03:54:31.510 --> 03:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
03:54:35.750 --> 03:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:37.429 --> 03:54:37.439 align:start position:0%
seeing none stephanie when you back up
 
03:54:39.429 --> 03:54:39.439 align:start position:0%
careful you have a dog right yes okay
 
03:54:40.550 --> 03:54:40.560 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much for your
 
03:54:43.110 --> 03:54:43.120 align:start position:0%
consideration we appreciate it

um

03:55:50.070 --> 03:55:50.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:55:52.870 --> 03:55:52.880 align:start position:0%
so full disclosure he is my service
 
03:55:54.550 --> 03:55:54.560 align:start position:0%
animal i do not have type 1 diabetes
 
03:55:57.910 --> 03:55:57.920 align:start position:0%
he's actually my ptsd service dog okay
 
03:55:59.349 --> 03:55:59.359 align:start position:0%
um i just want to thank you guys for
 
03:56:02.150 --> 03:56:02.160 align:start position:0%
letting us speak today um like i said i
 
03:56:03.910 --> 03:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
don't require diabetic alert dog but i
 
03:56:05.670 --> 03:56:05.680 align:start position:0%
do have a service animal
 
03:56:07.349 --> 03:56:07.359 align:start position:0%
um so i understand how difficult it is
 
03:56:09.349 --> 03:56:09.359 align:start position:0%
to be living you know with a medical
 
03:56:11.429 --> 03:56:11.439 align:start position:0%
device a living medical device around
 
03:56:12.950 --> 03:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
people that don't really you know
 
03:56:15.110 --> 03:56:15.120 align:start position:0%
understand why they're necessary or what
 
03:56:17.349 --> 03:56:17.359 align:start position:0%
exactly they can do
 
03:56:19.429 --> 03:56:19.439 align:start position:0%
i am however the spouse of a type one
 
03:56:22.950 --> 03:56:22.960 align:start position:0%
diabetic um who has a service dog
 
03:56:25.030 --> 03:56:25.040 align:start position:0%
she's the reason i'm here today
 
03:56:26.870 --> 03:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
she suffers from something called low
 
03:56:26.880 --> 03:56:28.150 align:start position:0%
she suffers from something called low
unawareness

03:56:28.150 --> 03:56:28.160 align:start position:0%
unawareness
 
03:56:29.670 --> 03:56:29.680 align:start position:0%
this means she doesn't feel when her
 
03:56:32.309 --> 03:56:32.319 align:start position:0%
blood sugar's dropping anymore
 
03:56:33.750 --> 03:56:33.760 align:start position:0%
this can be dangerous it can cause her
 
03:56:36.630 --> 03:56:36.640 align:start position:0%
to seize have permanent nerve damage
 
03:56:37.910 --> 03:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
you know she can die if a low blood
 
03:56:40.229 --> 03:56:40.239 align:start position:0%
sugar is left untreated
 
03:56:42.070 --> 03:56:42.080 align:start position:0%
uh i've spent years watching her try to
 
03:56:44.550 --> 03:56:44.560 align:start position:0%
mitigate this disease with insulin and
 
03:56:46.389 --> 03:56:46.399 align:start position:0%
diet and you know in her glucose
 
03:56:48.950 --> 03:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
monitors the problem is that technology
 
03:56:50.469 --> 03:56:50.479 align:start position:0%
is imperfect
 
03:56:52.469 --> 03:56:52.479 align:start position:0%
and it's often wrong or
 
03:56:54.070 --> 03:56:54.080 align:start position:0%
too slow to react to her rapidly
 
03:56:55.830 --> 03:56:55.840 align:start position:0%
dropping blood sugars
 
03:56:57.830 --> 03:56:57.840 align:start position:0%
so one day her endocrinologist said it
 
03:57:00.229 --> 03:57:00.239 align:start position:0%
was time to get a service dog and after
 
03:57:02.550 --> 03:57:02.560 align:start position:0%
years of worrying about her glucose
 
03:57:04.630 --> 03:57:04.640 align:start position:0%
levels dropping when she was alone it it
 
03:57:06.150 --> 03:57:06.160 align:start position:0%
was a relief for us to discover that
 
03:57:08.070 --> 03:57:08.080 align:start position:0%
there was a solution to this and that
 
03:57:10.309 --> 03:57:10.319 align:start position:0%
being a diabetic alert dog
 
03:57:12.870 --> 03:57:12.880 align:start position:0%
so she spent months researching trainers
 
03:57:14.630 --> 03:57:14.640 align:start position:0%
and programs we interviewed with
 
03:57:17.189 --> 03:57:17.199 align:start position:0%
trainers from all around new england she
 
03:57:18.870 --> 03:57:18.880 align:start position:0%
met different dogs until we found the
 
03:57:20.469 --> 03:57:20.479 align:start position:0%
right fit
 
03:57:22.550 --> 03:57:22.560 align:start position:0%
and we were lucky enough to match
 
03:57:25.189 --> 03:57:25.199 align:start position:0%
her with sawyer
 
03:57:27.990 --> 03:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
mary from granite state service dogs
 
03:57:29.429 --> 03:57:29.439 align:start position:0%
and since matching
 
03:57:31.750 --> 03:57:31.760 align:start position:0%
her with sawyer we've extensively worked
 
03:57:33.349 --> 03:57:33.359 align:start position:0%
on scent training and public access
 
03:57:35.110 --> 03:57:35.120 align:start position:0%
training with him
 
03:57:36.550 --> 03:57:36.560 align:start position:0%
and she's now able to go about her day
 
03:57:38.150 --> 03:57:38.160 align:start position:0%
with the comfort of knowing that even if
 
03:57:40.309 --> 03:57:40.319 align:start position:0%
she doesn't feel herself dropping or if
 
03:57:43.110 --> 03:57:43.120 align:start position:0%
her technology doesn't catch it in time
 
03:57:44.950 --> 03:57:44.960 align:start position:0%
sawyer's almost always able to notify
 
03:57:47.830 --> 03:57:47.840 align:start position:0%
her before the situation gets dangerous
 
03:57:49.189 --> 03:57:49.199 align:start position:0%
so we're asking that you guys add
 
03:57:51.189 --> 03:57:51.199 align:start position:0%
diabetes to the state statute as an
 
03:57:53.110 --> 03:57:53.120 align:start position:0%
additional protection for people like my
 
03:57:53.120 --> 03:57:54.309 align:start position:0%
additional protection for people like my
wife

03:57:54.309 --> 03:57:54.319 align:start position:0%
wife
 
03:57:55.990 --> 03:57:56.000 align:start position:0%
i understand it's already covered by the
 
03:57:57.590 --> 03:57:57.600 align:start position:0%
americans with disabilities act but
 
03:57:59.990 --> 03:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
federal laws can be changed so the more
 
03:58:02.389 --> 03:58:02.399 align:start position:0%
protections that we have to protect our
 
03:58:04.070 --> 03:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
citizens rights that actually need these
 
03:58:06.630 --> 03:58:06.640 align:start position:0%
dogs you know i i can't see that that's
 
03:58:08.229 --> 03:58:08.239 align:start position:0%
going to be bad
 
03:58:10.229 --> 03:58:10.239 align:start position:0%
additionally employers in the state are
 
03:58:13.189 --> 03:58:13.199 align:start position:0%
not always aware of ada regulations it's
 
03:58:14.790 --> 03:58:14.800 align:start position:0%
been very difficult for my wife to
 
03:58:16.870 --> 03:58:16.880 align:start position:0%
actually have sawyer with her when when
 
03:58:19.189 --> 03:58:19.199 align:start position:0%
she you know starts a new job
 
03:58:20.950 --> 03:58:20.960 align:start position:0%
so the more protection information we
 
03:58:22.389 --> 03:58:22.399 align:start position:0%
have the better it is for people in her
 
03:58:24.469 --> 03:58:24.479 align:start position:0%
position you know she's often been told
 
03:58:26.229 --> 03:58:26.239 align:start position:0%
well so-and-so has diabetes and they
 
03:58:27.590 --> 03:58:27.600 align:start position:0%
don't have a service dog so you don't
 
03:58:29.110 --> 03:58:29.120 align:start position:0%
need one either
 
03:58:31.670 --> 03:58:31.680 align:start position:0%
and that's that's just not acceptable um
 
03:58:33.189 --> 03:58:33.199 align:start position:0%
and not
 
03:58:35.110 --> 03:58:35.120 align:start position:0%
really legal so the more information you
 
03:58:37.030 --> 03:58:37.040 align:start position:0%
guys can get out you know the more
 
03:58:37.040 --> 03:58:38.469 align:start position:0%
guys can get out you know the more
appreciative

03:58:38.469 --> 03:58:38.479 align:start position:0%
appreciative
 
03:58:39.830 --> 03:58:39.840 align:start position:0%
um so i'm just asking that you
 
03:58:41.670 --> 03:58:41.680 align:start position:0%
respectfully consider adding diabetes to
 
03:58:44.070 --> 03:58:44.080 align:start position:0%
the service dog statute and thanks for
 
03:58:45.189 --> 03:58:45.199 align:start position:0%
letting us come here and talk to you
 
03:58:46.710 --> 03:58:46.720 align:start position:0%
guys about it but either you or sawyer
 
03:58:48.150 --> 03:58:48.160 align:start position:0%
take a question
 
03:58:49.990 --> 03:58:50.000 align:start position:0%
i mean i don't know that sacco can
 
03:58:52.389 --> 03:58:52.399 align:start position:0%
answer it but i'm sorry yeah all right
 
03:58:55.030 --> 03:58:55.040 align:start position:0%
yeah any question anybody mark twice if
 
03:58:56.830 --> 03:58:56.840 align:start position:0%
you agree
 
03:59:00.550 --> 03:59:00.560 align:start position:0%
um folsom i'm only asking you a question
 
03:59:04.469 --> 03:59:04.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:04.479 --> 03:59:05.429 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

03:59:05.429 --> 03:59:05.439 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
03:59:05.439 --> 03:59:06.469 align:start position:0%
sorry
um

03:59:06.469 --> 03:59:06.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:59:09.110 --> 03:59:09.120 align:start position:0%
my question real question sorry yes
 
03:59:10.950 --> 03:59:10.960 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman thank you for taking
 
03:59:14.550 --> 03:59:14.560 align:start position:0%
my question um are there enough service
 
03:59:17.830 --> 03:59:17.840 align:start position:0%
dogs available that are trained
 
03:59:20.790 --> 03:59:20.800 align:start position:0%
to fill the need um and the requests
 
03:59:23.349 --> 03:59:23.359 align:start position:0%
from people coming in for a service dog
 
03:59:25.590 --> 03:59:25.600 align:start position:0%
for diabetes so what i can tell you is
 
03:59:26.710 --> 03:59:26.720 align:start position:0%
that we're actually in a training
 
03:59:28.229 --> 03:59:28.239 align:start position:0%
program so
 
03:59:29.830 --> 03:59:29.840 align:start position:0%
you know coach was trained for two years
 
03:59:31.830 --> 03:59:31.840 align:start position:0%
before he made it to ella
 
03:59:33.670 --> 03:59:33.680 align:start position:0%
and we actually are actively still in
 
03:59:35.429 --> 03:59:35.439 align:start position:0%
the process of training sawyer we have
 
03:59:37.830 --> 03:59:37.840 align:start position:0%
classes um as a group once a week for
 
03:59:39.189 --> 03:59:39.199 align:start position:0%
people with various disabilities
 
03:59:41.429 --> 03:59:41.439 align:start position:0%
training their dogs and then we also
 
03:59:43.670 --> 03:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
have one-on-one time with our trainer um
 
03:59:45.670 --> 03:59:45.680 align:start position:0%
and she breeds specifically um with
 
03:59:47.590 --> 03:59:47.600 align:start position:0%
service work in mind so she you know
 
03:59:48.870 --> 03:59:48.880 align:start position:0%
she's definitely and she has different
 
03:59:51.189 --> 03:59:51.199 align:start position:0%
breeds of dogs available for people um
 
03:59:53.030 --> 03:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
depending on their needs
 
03:59:57.110 --> 03:59:57.120 align:start position:0%
so i think as long as you know you have
 
03:59:58.950 --> 03:59:58.960 align:start position:0%
the means or you are capable of doing
 
04:00:00.950 --> 04:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
the training yourself i know for a fact
 
04:00:02.550 --> 04:00:02.560 align:start position:0%
i was not which is why we went through a
 
04:00:04.389 --> 04:00:04.399 align:start position:0%
training program you know there's
 
04:00:05.750 --> 04:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
there's definitely you know the
 
04:00:08.229 --> 04:00:08.239 align:start position:0%
availability out there i think you know
 
04:00:10.550 --> 04:00:10.560 align:start position:0%
with diabetic alert dogs especially it's
 
04:00:12.229 --> 04:00:12.239 align:start position:0%
important that you you know you're
 
04:00:13.910 --> 04:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
finding a dog that has the ability to
 
04:00:16.309 --> 04:00:16.319 align:start position:0%
scent train saco does not care about
 
04:00:18.630 --> 04:00:18.640 align:start position:0%
scent training not his jam
 
04:00:21.670 --> 04:00:21.680 align:start position:0%
at all but sawyer took to it no problem
 
04:00:23.349 --> 04:00:23.359 align:start position:0%
so it just really depends on what your
 
04:00:25.349 --> 04:00:25.359 align:start position:0%
needs are and you know
 
04:00:26.630 --> 04:00:26.640 align:start position:0%
looking in the right place like i said
 
04:00:28.229 --> 04:00:28.239 align:start position:0%
we interviewed with several trainers in
 
04:00:29.910 --> 04:00:29.920 align:start position:0%
the new england area before we found one
 
04:00:29.920 --> 04:00:31.110 align:start position:0%
the new england area before we found one
so

04:00:31.110 --> 04:00:31.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:00:34.710 --> 04:00:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:38.070 --> 04:00:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:40.630 --> 04:00:40.640 align:start position:0%
trying to do two things at once um uh
 
04:00:42.070 --> 04:00:42.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
04:00:43.910 --> 04:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question i heard from the
 
04:00:46.550 --> 04:00:46.560 align:start position:0%
previous speaker that the dog was more
 
04:00:46.560 --> 04:00:47.750 align:start position:0%
previous speaker that the dog was more
sensitive

04:00:47.750 --> 04:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
sensitive
 
04:00:50.070 --> 04:00:50.080 align:start position:0%
um in the sense that they could detect
 
04:00:52.710 --> 04:00:52.720 align:start position:0%
it going up before the alarm went off
 
04:00:55.110 --> 04:00:55.120 align:start position:0%
uh is have you found the same experience
 
04:00:57.269 --> 04:00:57.279 align:start position:0%
that the dog is actually
 
04:00:59.910 --> 04:00:59.920 align:start position:0%
keeps the glucose at a
 
04:01:02.710 --> 04:01:02.720 align:start position:0%
out of the danger range better yes so
 
04:01:05.110 --> 04:01:05.120 align:start position:0%
sawyer is trained for low blood sugars
 
04:01:06.790 --> 04:01:06.800 align:start position:0%
um that's primarily the issue my wife
 
04:01:08.469 --> 04:01:08.479 align:start position:0%
has um
 
04:01:10.309 --> 04:01:10.319 align:start position:0%
so he definitely has been able to find
 
04:01:10.319 --> 04:01:10.950 align:start position:0%
so he definitely has been able to find
it

04:01:10.950 --> 04:01:10.960 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:01:13.750 --> 04:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
a lot faster than the technology
 
04:01:15.510 --> 04:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
he just smells it sooner you know what i
 
04:01:17.429 --> 04:01:17.439 align:start position:0%
mean it might the technology tests her
 
04:01:19.110 --> 04:01:19.120 align:start position:0%
every five minutes and if she's dropping
 
04:01:20.870 --> 04:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
rapidly before the next time it tests
 
04:01:20.880 --> 04:01:22.070 align:start position:0%
rapidly before the next time it tests
her

04:01:22.070 --> 04:01:22.080 align:start position:0%
her
 
04:01:26.070 --> 04:01:26.080 align:start position:0%
she could go from you know 90 to 50 and
 
04:01:28.710 --> 04:01:28.720 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah
 
04:01:31.269 --> 04:01:31.279 align:start position:0%
thank you and the chairs uh called stacy
 
04:01:35.189 --> 04:01:35.199 align:start position:0%
patterson gagnon and we've got
 
04:01:36.950 --> 04:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
a written document coming around from
 
04:01:36.960 --> 04:01:49.830 align:start position:0%
a written document coming around from
you

04:01:49.830 --> 04:01:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:51.910 --> 04:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
come here
 
04:02:13.030 --> 04:02:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:16.389 --> 04:02:16.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:17.510 --> 04:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
first of all i just want to say good

letting us be today i'm not going to be
 
04:02:24.389 --> 04:02:24.399 align:start position:0%
anywhere near as polished as jeans
 
04:02:24.399 --> 04:02:25.189 align:start position:0%
anywhere near as polished as jeans
um

04:02:25.189 --> 04:02:25.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:02:26.790 --> 04:02:26.800 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for coming now really
 
04:02:29.750 --> 04:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate it um so my name as he
 
04:02:31.429 --> 04:02:31.439 align:start position:0%
mentioned is stacy patterson gaddon i'm
 
04:02:33.510 --> 04:02:33.520 align:start position:0%
a resident of pembroke new hampshire
 
04:02:34.950 --> 04:02:34.960 align:start position:0%
uh about eight years ago i wasn't
 
04:02:36.790 --> 04:02:36.800 align:start position:0%
feeling too well my vision was blurry i
 
04:02:39.269 --> 04:02:39.279 align:start position:0%
was constantly fatigued always thirsty
 
04:02:40.630 --> 04:02:40.640 align:start position:0%
good friend of mine was like maybe have
 
04:02:43.189 --> 04:02:43.199 align:start position:0%
diabetes and i'm like yeah no
 
04:02:44.870 --> 04:02:44.880 align:start position:0%
um she tested my blood sugar and my
 
04:02:47.189 --> 04:02:47.199 align:start position:0%
blood sugar was 370.
 
04:02:48.389 --> 04:02:48.399 align:start position:0%
for those of us who don't know what that
 
04:02:49.750 --> 04:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
means it's supposed to be between 80 and
 
04:02:49.760 --> 04:02:51.189 align:start position:0%
means it's supposed to be between 80 and
120.

04:02:51.189 --> 04:02:51.199 align:start position:0%
120.
 
04:02:52.630 --> 04:02:52.640 align:start position:0%
that was my um
 
04:02:55.189 --> 04:02:55.199 align:start position:0%
introduction to the world of diabetes
 
04:02:58.469 --> 04:02:58.479 align:start position:0%
i was diagnosed at 37 years old
 
04:02:58.479 --> 04:02:59.590 align:start position:0%
i was diagnosed at 37 years old
um

04:02:59.590 --> 04:02:59.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:03:02.710 --> 04:03:02.720 align:start position:0%
i can't imagine being diagnosed at eight
 
04:03:04.790 --> 04:03:04.800 align:start position:0%
you're my hero i don't know how you did
 
04:03:04.800 --> 04:03:05.429 align:start position:0%
you're my hero i don't know how you did
it

04:03:05.429 --> 04:03:05.439 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:03:05.439 --> 04:03:06.469 align:start position:0%
it
um

04:03:06.469 --> 04:03:06.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:03:08.469 --> 04:03:08.479 align:start position:0%
the thing with type one and it was it is
 
04:03:09.990 --> 04:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
type one it's not type two or anything
 
04:03:12.229 --> 04:03:12.239 align:start position:0%
like that is it's a really misunderstood
 
04:03:12.239 --> 04:03:13.510 align:start position:0%
like that is it's a really misunderstood
disease

04:03:13.510 --> 04:03:13.520 align:start position:0%
disease
 
04:03:15.269 --> 04:03:15.279 align:start position:0%
so it's kind of different for everybody
 
04:03:16.790 --> 04:03:16.800 align:start position:0%
who experience it
 
04:03:18.550 --> 04:03:18.560 align:start position:0%
by that i mean
 
04:03:20.389 --> 04:03:20.399 align:start position:0%
elle and i can eat a cupcake we're not
 
04:03:21.670 --> 04:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
gonna dose the same amount of insulin
 
04:03:23.510 --> 04:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
and we're gonna have different results
 
04:03:25.590 --> 04:03:25.600 align:start position:0%
but it sounds good doesn't it
 
04:03:27.590 --> 04:03:27.600 align:start position:0%
um about three years ago i was at my
 
04:03:29.110 --> 04:03:29.120 align:start position:0%
endocrinologist's office and i was
 
04:03:30.389 --> 04:03:30.399 align:start position:0%
telling him you know that i really
 
04:03:35.030 --> 04:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:36.830 --> 04:03:36.840 align:start position:0%
sorry is very curious about
 
04:03:39.110 --> 04:03:39.120 align:start position:0%
coach he kind of just wants to play with
 
04:03:39.120 --> 04:03:39.750 align:start position:0%
coach he kind of just wants to play with
him

04:03:39.750 --> 04:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
him
 
04:03:41.670 --> 04:03:41.680 align:start position:0%
um but i was at my endo's office and i
 
04:03:42.790 --> 04:03:42.800 align:start position:0%
was letting him know i said you know i'm
 
04:03:45.349 --> 04:03:45.359 align:start position:0%
just i'm dropping just like this
 
04:03:46.710 --> 04:03:46.720 align:start position:0%
and at the time i was still what's
 
04:03:48.389 --> 04:03:48.399 align:start position:0%
called honeymooning so i was just kind
 
04:03:49.750 --> 04:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
of up and down
 
04:03:52.070 --> 04:03:52.080 align:start position:0%
i'm at a very long honeymoon it wasn't
 
04:03:53.590 --> 04:03:53.600 align:start position:0%
anywhere near as enjoyable as a regular
 
04:03:54.870 --> 04:03:54.880 align:start position:0%
honeymoon just wanted to put that out
 
04:03:54.880 --> 04:03:55.750 align:start position:0%
honeymoon just wanted to put that out
there

04:03:55.750 --> 04:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:03:57.269 --> 04:03:57.279 align:start position:0%
um but
 
04:03:59.349 --> 04:03:59.359 align:start position:0%
while most of people think diabetes you
 
04:04:00.790 --> 04:04:00.800 align:start position:0%
think you know high blood sugar you're
 
04:04:02.710 --> 04:04:02.720 align:start position:0%
constantly treating with insulin for
 
04:04:02.720 --> 04:04:07.030 align:start position:0%
constantly treating with insulin for
that

04:04:07.030 --> 04:04:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:09.110 --> 04:04:09.120 align:start position:0%
also very curious about coach
 
04:04:09.120 --> 04:04:09.990 align:start position:0%
also very curious about coach
um

04:04:09.990 --> 04:04:10.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:04:11.670 --> 04:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
we also have to treat for lows and the
 
04:04:13.590 --> 04:04:13.600 align:start position:0%
lows can be very very dangerous because
 
04:04:15.750 --> 04:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
they can happen very very quickly
 
04:04:15.760 --> 04:04:16.710 align:start position:0%
they can happen very very quickly
um

04:04:16.710 --> 04:04:16.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:04:18.790 --> 04:04:18.800 align:start position:0%
i do wear a cgm
 
04:04:21.349 --> 04:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
um and i do wear an insulin pump
 
04:04:23.110 --> 04:04:23.120 align:start position:0%
just like um alex said we wear two
 
04:04:24.950 --> 04:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
totally different systems
 
04:04:27.349 --> 04:04:27.359 align:start position:0%
um the good thing about technology is
 
04:04:29.910 --> 04:04:29.920 align:start position:0%
yes it's grown and it's wonderful and it
 
04:04:31.510 --> 04:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
has gotten so much better since my first
 
04:04:31.520 --> 04:04:33.830 align:start position:0%
has gotten so much better since my first
cgm

04:04:33.830 --> 04:04:33.840 align:start position:0%
cgm
 
04:04:35.830 --> 04:04:35.840 align:start position:0%
but there's a lot of moving parts to
 
04:04:37.590 --> 04:04:37.600 align:start position:0%
these things there's sensors there's
 
04:04:37.600 --> 04:04:39.269 align:start position:0%
these things there's sensors there's
transmitters

04:04:39.269 --> 04:04:39.279 align:start position:0%
transmitters
 
04:04:40.870 --> 04:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
the pump itself has about three
 
04:04:41.990 --> 04:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
different parts
 
04:04:43.510 --> 04:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
this technology can stop working
 
04:04:43.520 --> 04:04:45.110 align:start position:0%
this technology can stop working
altogether

04:04:45.110 --> 04:04:45.120 align:start position:0%
altogether
 
04:04:47.110 --> 04:04:47.120 align:start position:0%
or one piece can be off throwing the
 
04:04:49.990 --> 04:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
entire system off
 
04:04:51.590 --> 04:04:51.600 align:start position:0%
i guess that's
 
04:04:52.870 --> 04:04:52.880 align:start position:0%
the biggest thing for me because i was
 
04:04:55.189 --> 04:04:55.199 align:start position:0%
like oh cgm like continuous glucose
 
04:04:57.429 --> 04:04:57.439 align:start position:0%
monitor i won't need a dog
 
04:04:59.349 --> 04:04:59.359 align:start position:0%
it turns out you know if you don't know
 
04:05:01.189 --> 04:05:01.199 align:start position:0%
you're dropping and the cgm is not
 
04:05:03.349 --> 04:05:03.359 align:start position:0%
working you put yourself in a very very
 
04:05:05.429 --> 04:05:05.439 align:start position:0%
precarious position
 
04:05:05.439 --> 04:05:06.950 align:start position:0%
precarious position
so

04:05:06.950 --> 04:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:05:08.630 --> 04:05:08.640 align:start position:0%
i mean luckily i have good insurance and
 
04:05:10.469 --> 04:05:10.479 align:start position:0%
i can you know go on this this system
 
04:05:12.309 --> 04:05:12.319 align:start position:0%
and the cgm and it's wonderful not a lot
 
04:05:14.630 --> 04:05:14.640 align:start position:0%
of people get that opportunity
 
04:05:14.640 --> 04:05:15.670 align:start position:0%
of people get that opportunity
but

04:05:15.670 --> 04:05:15.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:05:17.269 --> 04:05:17.279 align:start position:0%
there are currently four different kinds
 
04:05:20.469 --> 04:05:20.479 align:start position:0%
of cgms two only work really well
 
04:05:20.479 --> 04:05:21.349 align:start position:0%
of cgms two only work really well
um

04:05:21.349 --> 04:05:21.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:05:23.110 --> 04:05:23.120 align:start position:0%
so the whole system that i have is
 
04:05:24.710 --> 04:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
basically like a working pancreas like
 
04:05:26.790 --> 04:05:26.800 align:start position:0%
it will if i'm dropping it will stop
 
04:05:28.550 --> 04:05:28.560 align:start position:0%
insulin if i'm going high
 
04:05:30.229 --> 04:05:30.239 align:start position:0%
it will administer just a little bit of
 
04:05:33.510 --> 04:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:36.150 --> 04:05:36.160 align:start position:0%
what i wanted to do in getting sawyer
 
04:05:37.910 --> 04:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
and you know finally matching up with
 
04:05:39.590 --> 04:05:39.600 align:start position:0%
him and we had gone through
 
04:05:41.030 --> 04:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
like my wife had said we had interviewed
 
04:05:42.309 --> 04:05:42.319 align:start position:0%
different trainers we interviewed
 
04:05:44.790 --> 04:05:44.800 align:start position:0%
different programs things like that um
 
04:05:44.800 --> 04:05:45.590 align:start position:0%
different programs things like that um
is

04:05:45.590 --> 04:05:45.600 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:05:47.349 --> 04:05:47.359 align:start position:0%
not only did i want a dog to work but i
 
04:05:49.750 --> 04:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to work the dog i wanted to make
 
04:05:52.469 --> 04:05:52.479 align:start position:0%
sure that if something had happened
 
04:05:54.630 --> 04:05:54.640 align:start position:0%
you know i i didn't want just you know
 
04:05:56.550 --> 04:05:56.560 align:start position:0%
like i don't really know what to do
 
04:05:58.469 --> 04:05:58.479 align:start position:0%
so we found you know granite state
 
04:06:00.070 --> 04:06:00.080 align:start position:0%
service dogs and mary finn layson has
 
04:06:01.670 --> 04:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
been amazing
 
04:06:03.269 --> 04:06:03.279 align:start position:0%
she's a very hands-on approach we have a
 
04:06:05.189 --> 04:06:05.199 align:start position:0%
very hands-on approach started with a
 
04:06:06.950 --> 04:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
lot of public access
 
04:06:08.710 --> 04:06:08.720 align:start position:0%
and then we go to scent training
 
04:06:10.710 --> 04:06:10.720 align:start position:0%
and he's got about an 85
 
04:06:13.670 --> 04:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
accuracy rate when i'm dropping
 
04:06:16.229 --> 04:06:16.239 align:start position:0%
he's supposed to spin
 
04:06:17.910 --> 04:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
he does not
 
04:06:17.920 --> 04:06:19.670 align:start position:0%
he does not
um

04:06:19.670 --> 04:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:06:21.750 --> 04:06:21.760 align:start position:0%
as any trainer will tell you sometimes
 
04:06:23.269 --> 04:06:23.279 align:start position:0%
you teach him one thing but they do
 
04:06:25.750 --> 04:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
another um so he actually just gets up
 
04:06:27.670 --> 04:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
and pushes me
 
04:06:29.269 --> 04:06:29.279 align:start position:0%
very very easy to know exactly what he's
 
04:06:30.469 --> 04:06:30.479 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
04:06:32.150 --> 04:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
so he's very very good at that
 
04:06:33.750 --> 04:06:33.760 align:start position:0%
so once i had had him to the point where
 
04:06:35.349 --> 04:06:35.359 align:start position:0%
scent training was was going really well
 
04:06:36.950 --> 04:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
i went to my employer at the time and i
 
04:06:38.710 --> 04:06:38.720 align:start position:0%
said i really like to bring my service
 
04:06:42.389 --> 04:06:42.399 align:start position:0%
dog to work and she said a flat no
 
04:06:44.469 --> 04:06:44.479 align:start position:0%
and i asked why and she said
 
04:06:46.950 --> 04:06:46.960 align:start position:0%
it's they're not allowed here
 
04:06:49.110 --> 04:06:49.120 align:start position:0%
to which case
 
04:06:50.870 --> 04:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
i did get a whole bunch of pieces of
 
04:06:52.630 --> 04:06:52.640 align:start position:0%
information and email her and let her
 
04:06:54.630 --> 04:06:54.640 align:start position:0%
know that that was the case
 
04:06:56.630 --> 04:06:56.640 align:start position:0%
so she was a little upset that i had
 
04:06:58.229 --> 04:06:58.239 align:start position:0%
pushed that on her so she asked for a
 
04:07:00.389 --> 04:07:00.399 align:start position:0%
letter from my doctor a letter from my
 
04:07:03.750 --> 04:07:03.760 align:start position:0%
trainer an intestinal parasite test
 
04:07:04.710 --> 04:07:04.720 align:start position:0%
for those of you who don't know what
 
04:07:06.150 --> 04:07:06.160 align:start position:0%
that is if a
 
04:07:08.710 --> 04:07:08.720 align:start position:0%
person came into where i was working and
 
04:07:11.030 --> 04:07:11.040 align:start position:0%
tried to eat whatever came out of him
 
04:07:12.710 --> 04:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
that that would be why that test was
 
04:07:14.550 --> 04:07:14.560 align:start position:0%
administered don't know what
 
04:07:16.469 --> 04:07:16.479 align:start position:0%
um videos and pictures of sawyer
 
04:07:16.479 --> 04:07:17.510 align:start position:0%
um videos and pictures of sawyer
training

04:07:17.510 --> 04:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
training
 
04:07:19.670 --> 04:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
and full disclosure of my entire health
 
04:07:19.680 --> 04:07:21.030 align:start position:0%
and full disclosure of my entire health
history

04:07:21.030 --> 04:07:21.040 align:start position:0%
history
 
04:07:23.030 --> 04:07:23.040 align:start position:0%
yes i know
 
04:07:25.750 --> 04:07:25.760 align:start position:0%
i know right yeah so it took me by
 
04:07:27.110 --> 04:07:27.120 align:start position:0%
surprise as they could ask for all of
 
04:07:27.120 --> 04:07:28.070 align:start position:0%
surprise as they could ask for all of
that

04:07:28.070 --> 04:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:07:31.189 --> 04:07:31.199 align:start position:0%
so there's really no procedure there's
 
04:07:32.950 --> 04:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
there just isn't
 
04:07:35.269 --> 04:07:35.279 align:start position:0%
i didn't like that i brought him to work
 
04:07:36.790 --> 04:07:36.800 align:start position:0%
and everything was fine but there was
 
04:07:38.070 --> 04:07:38.080 align:start position:0%
just a lot of
 
04:07:39.830 --> 04:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
you know we found dog hair in the
 
04:07:41.189 --> 04:07:41.199 align:start position:0%
bathroom and i'm like it's gonna happen
 
04:07:42.870 --> 04:07:42.880 align:start position:0%
he's a service dog
 
04:07:44.710 --> 04:07:44.720 align:start position:0%
so they just kind of started to kind of
 
04:07:47.349 --> 04:07:47.359 align:start position:0%
grind me down i decided to leave went to
 
04:07:49.030 --> 04:07:49.040 align:start position:0%
another practice ran into the same
 
04:07:49.040 --> 04:07:50.389 align:start position:0%
another practice ran into the same
situation

04:07:50.389 --> 04:07:50.399 align:start position:0%
situation
 
04:07:52.870 --> 04:07:52.880 align:start position:0%
where they told me to disclose my entire
 
04:07:54.630 --> 04:07:54.640 align:start position:0%
health history
 
04:07:57.590 --> 04:07:57.600 align:start position:0%
to just have my service dog at work
 
04:08:00.070 --> 04:08:00.080 align:start position:0%
so i run into this a lot
 
04:08:01.429 --> 04:08:01.439 align:start position:0%
i do work part time in an animal
 
04:08:03.990 --> 04:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
hospital they have no problem
 
04:08:05.189 --> 04:08:05.199 align:start position:0%
they didn't ask for anything they were
 
04:08:06.309 --> 04:08:06.319 align:start position:0%
like bring them in
 
04:08:07.830 --> 04:08:07.840 align:start position:0%
let's do this
 
04:08:11.670 --> 04:08:11.680 align:start position:0%
um having type 1 so late in life
 
04:08:11.680 --> 04:08:12.630 align:start position:0%
um having type 1 so late in life
is

04:08:12.630 --> 04:08:12.640 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:08:14.149 --> 04:08:14.159 align:start position:0%
it's first of all it's incredibly hard
 
04:08:16.550 --> 04:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
to manage both physically and mentally
 
04:08:18.389 --> 04:08:18.399 align:start position:0%
you know you have um
 
04:08:20.070 --> 04:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
the type one people and then you have
 
04:08:22.149 --> 04:08:22.159 align:start position:0%
the type one parents
 
04:08:23.830 --> 04:08:23.840 align:start position:0%
i cannot imagine
 
04:08:25.910 --> 04:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
having to wake up at twelve
 
04:08:25.920 --> 04:08:27.110 align:start position:0%
having to wake up at twelve
two

04:08:27.110 --> 04:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
two
 
04:08:27.120 --> 04:08:28.389 align:start position:0%
two
four

04:08:28.389 --> 04:08:28.399 align:start position:0%
four
 
04:08:30.710 --> 04:08:30.720 align:start position:0%
and six to test your child to make sure
 
04:08:32.469 --> 04:08:32.479 align:start position:0%
that their blood sugar is okay
 
04:08:34.229 --> 04:08:34.239 align:start position:0%
steph i don't know how you do it i don't
 
04:08:36.309 --> 04:08:36.319 align:start position:0%
know how you do it at all
 
04:08:36.319 --> 04:08:37.349 align:start position:0%
know how you do it at all
but

04:08:37.349 --> 04:08:37.359 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:08:39.429 --> 04:08:39.439 align:start position:0%
you know type one and we i mentioned
 
04:08:40.870 --> 04:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
type one and i've mentioned it many
 
04:08:42.950 --> 04:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
times in this testimony because it's not
 
04:08:44.790 --> 04:08:44.800 align:start position:0%
just diabetes people think diabetes
 
04:08:47.189 --> 04:08:47.199 align:start position:0%
right they think it's a punchline
 
04:08:49.189 --> 04:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
that's not type 1 definitely not it's an
 
04:08:51.030 --> 04:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
autoimmune disease
 
04:08:52.950 --> 04:08:52.960 align:start position:0%
my body is attacking itself this is why
 
04:08:54.950 --> 04:08:54.960 align:start position:0%
this happened
 
04:08:54.960 --> 04:08:55.670 align:start position:0%
this happened
so

04:08:55.670 --> 04:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:08:56.790 --> 04:08:56.800 align:start position:0%
you know that's just something that you
 
04:08:58.149 --> 04:08:58.159 align:start position:0%
can't control it's something that you
 
04:08:58.159 --> 04:08:59.030 align:start position:0%
can't control it's something that you
can't

04:08:59.030 --> 04:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
can't
 
04:09:01.030 --> 04:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
really manage and you can do the same
 
04:09:04.070 --> 04:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
thing the exact same way every day and
 
04:09:06.469 --> 04:09:06.479 align:start position:0%
you're going to get different results
 
04:09:07.670 --> 04:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
so just
 
04:09:08.790 --> 04:09:08.800 align:start position:0%
there's something to be said about
 
04:09:10.070 --> 04:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
explaining it but there's something even
 
04:09:12.389 --> 04:09:12.399 align:start position:0%
more about experiencing it we just deal
 
04:09:13.510 --> 04:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
with a lot of
 
04:09:15.510 --> 04:09:15.520 align:start position:0%
myth and stuff like that
 
04:09:15.520 --> 04:09:16.389 align:start position:0%
myth and stuff like that
so

04:09:16.389 --> 04:09:16.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:09:18.389 --> 04:09:18.399 align:start position:0%
to add it to this to the state that
 
04:09:19.990 --> 04:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
would be wonderful at least we get some
 
04:09:21.910 --> 04:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
recognition and say hey you know what
 
04:09:23.510 --> 04:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
this is important
 
04:09:24.870 --> 04:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
and that's going to hopefully encourage
 
04:09:26.630 --> 04:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
other type ones to maybe look into
 
04:09:27.990 --> 04:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
getting service dogs or maybe feel a
 
04:09:29.429 --> 04:09:29.439 align:start position:0%
little bit more protected

i met stacy oh i think it was
 
04:10:15.429 --> 04:10:15.439 align:start position:0%
close to almost two years ago
 
04:10:18.149 --> 04:10:18.159 align:start position:0%
when she was looking for some type of
 
04:10:21.750 --> 04:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
service dog for her diabetes now
 
04:10:23.750 --> 04:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
i had been doing service dogs for quite
 
04:10:25.910 --> 04:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
some time i
 
04:10:28.309 --> 04:10:28.319 align:start position:0%
had not done a diabetic service dog at
 
04:10:30.070 --> 04:10:30.080 align:start position:0%
that point but i wanted to you just have
 
04:10:32.389 --> 04:10:32.399 align:start position:0%
to have the client to start with
 
04:10:36.550 --> 04:10:36.560 align:start position:0%
and um i work with corgis i also work
 
04:10:39.110 --> 04:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
with english setters
 
04:10:39.120 --> 04:10:40.070 align:start position:0%
with english setters
and

04:10:40.070 --> 04:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:10:43.349 --> 04:10:43.359 align:start position:0%
i've recently started with some labs
 
04:10:46.790 --> 04:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
and you know they had come to me and
 
04:10:48.389 --> 04:10:48.399 align:start position:0%
we did some meetings and sat down with
 
04:10:50.469 --> 04:10:50.479 align:start position:0%
some of the different dogs that i had
 
04:10:52.790 --> 04:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
and talked about you know what they were
 
04:10:55.670 --> 04:10:55.680 align:start position:0%
looking for and of course stacy her lows
 
04:10:58.309 --> 04:10:58.319 align:start position:0%
are her most important um
 
04:11:01.990 --> 04:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
uh her her biggest risk is her lows um
 
04:11:03.910 --> 04:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
and we had talked for a while we we had
 
04:11:05.670 --> 04:11:05.680 align:start position:0%
a good relationship with each other we
 
04:11:07.189 --> 04:11:07.199 align:start position:0%
felt very comfortable
 
04:11:08.950 --> 04:11:08.960 align:start position:0%
they got to meet some of the dogs at
 
04:11:10.710 --> 04:11:10.720 align:start position:0%
that time
 
04:11:12.550 --> 04:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
sawyer was
 
04:11:15.189 --> 04:11:15.199 align:start position:0%
just coming up on six months a little
 
04:11:16.710 --> 04:11:16.720 align:start position:0%
over six months
 
04:11:16.720 --> 04:11:18.070 align:start position:0%
over six months
and

04:11:18.070 --> 04:11:18.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:11:20.389 --> 04:11:20.399 align:start position:0%
i knew that sawyer had a very strong
 
04:11:22.389 --> 04:11:22.399 align:start position:0%
nose there was lots of things that led
 
04:11:25.510 --> 04:11:25.520 align:start position:0%
to that in my observations with him um i
 
04:11:26.710 --> 04:11:26.720 align:start position:0%
felt that
 
04:11:26.720 --> 04:11:27.590 align:start position:0%
felt that
um

04:11:27.590 --> 04:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:29.510 --> 04:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
he would be
 
04:11:32.309 --> 04:11:32.319 align:start position:0%
definitely a good candidate for
 
04:11:32.319 --> 04:11:33.510 align:start position:0%
definitely a good candidate for
um

04:11:33.510 --> 04:11:33.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:35.429 --> 04:11:35.439 align:start position:0%
you know this project of doing a
 
04:11:38.630 --> 04:11:38.640 align:start position:0%
diabetic alert dog um and
 
04:11:38.640 --> 04:11:39.750 align:start position:0%
diabetic alert dog um and
uh

04:11:39.750 --> 04:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:11:41.670 --> 04:11:41.680 align:start position:0%
they took a liking to him as well and
 
04:11:43.750 --> 04:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
they said yeah well you know stacy says
 
04:11:43.760 --> 04:11:44.550 align:start position:0%
they said yeah well you know stacy says
yeah

04:11:44.550 --> 04:11:44.560 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:11:46.870 --> 04:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
i really like sawyer so we started the
 
04:11:50.550 --> 04:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
process of um training him
 
04:11:53.670 --> 04:11:53.680 align:start position:0%
for her disability um we did mouth swabs
 
04:11:55.510 --> 04:11:55.520 align:start position:0%
when she had homework you got to do your
 
04:11:58.469 --> 04:11:58.479 align:start position:0%
mouth swabs when your sugar's low and
 
04:12:00.229 --> 04:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:12:02.070 --> 04:12:02.080 align:start position:0%
and she had to start doing that and it
 
04:12:03.910 --> 04:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
had to be when she hadn't eaten for at
 
04:12:05.990 --> 04:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
least a half an hour and we were
 
04:12:07.510 --> 04:12:07.520 align:start position:0%
freezing the swabs and then we were
 
04:12:11.510 --> 04:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
training the dog to detect that and um
 
04:12:12.469 --> 04:12:12.479 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:12:14.229 --> 04:12:14.239 align:start position:0%
rather it was it was amazing because
 
04:12:16.229 --> 04:12:16.239 align:start position:0%
very quickly he did pick up on it and it
 
04:12:18.229 --> 04:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
was within months that they were telling
 
04:12:20.710 --> 04:12:20.720 align:start position:0%
me he's waking me up at night they had
 
04:12:22.710 --> 04:12:22.720 align:start position:0%
stories of like
 
04:12:26.070 --> 04:12:26.080 align:start position:0%
wow i i didn't i didn't hear any alarms
 
04:12:28.550 --> 04:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
you know i was fast asleep and he jumped
 
04:12:30.710 --> 04:12:30.720 align:start position:0%
on me and he woke me up and
 
04:12:32.469 --> 04:12:32.479 align:start position:0%
and he said ma
 
04:12:34.630 --> 04:12:34.640 align:start position:0%
something's going on i can smell that
 
04:12:37.990 --> 04:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
smell and um it was fantastic i was
 
04:12:41.110 --> 04:12:41.120 align:start position:0%
really impressed how quickly um he did
 
04:12:43.910 --> 04:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
pick up on that and then going forward
 
04:12:43.920 --> 04:12:45.189 align:start position:0%
pick up on that and then going forward
um

04:12:45.189 --> 04:12:45.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:12:46.950 --> 04:12:46.960 align:start position:0%
you know we did a lot of public access
 
04:12:48.790 --> 04:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
testing and we do a lot of stuff out in
 
04:12:50.630 --> 04:12:50.640 align:start position:0%
public to make sure the dogs are well
 
04:12:52.550 --> 04:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
behaved um they're holding their
 
04:12:55.110 --> 04:12:55.120 align:start position:0%
commands they're um you know polite in
 
04:12:58.070 --> 04:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
public and um as they say you know
 
04:13:00.790 --> 04:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
sometimes invisible um
 
04:13:00.800 --> 04:13:01.990 align:start position:0%
sometimes invisible um
and

04:13:01.990 --> 04:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:13:03.349 --> 04:13:03.359 align:start position:0%
you know as we're going along and the
 
04:13:06.070 --> 04:13:06.080 align:start position:0%
dog is ready now it's time to okay let's
 
04:13:08.950 --> 04:13:08.960 align:start position:0%
add the dog into your your work space
 
04:13:11.590 --> 04:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
because it's not just night it's daytime
 
04:13:14.950 --> 04:13:14.960 align:start position:0%
that she also needs this dog and
 
04:13:17.030 --> 04:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
there were some difficulties there and i
 
04:13:19.510 --> 04:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
have helped other clients with dogs
 
04:13:22.389 --> 04:13:22.399 align:start position:0%
going into workplaces um
 
04:13:24.790 --> 04:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
and had to write letters and of course i
 
04:13:27.269 --> 04:13:27.279 align:start position:0%
was really shocked with how some of the
 
04:13:30.950 --> 04:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
employers handled the request and all
 
04:13:33.110 --> 04:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
the questions they had to ask me and
 
04:13:35.750 --> 04:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
drilling me like who was i and
 
04:13:37.830 --> 04:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
um you know does she really have a
 
04:13:41.670 --> 04:13:41.680 align:start position:0%
disability or why can't she you know
 
04:13:43.189 --> 04:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
you know just have the dog at home why
 
04:13:45.510 --> 04:13:45.520 align:start position:0%
does she have to have it at work and
 
04:13:49.750 --> 04:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
um yadia and as said previously
 
04:13:51.510 --> 04:13:51.520 align:start position:0%
people will say well so-and-so has
 
04:13:53.510 --> 04:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
diabetes well i have diabetes i have
 
04:13:56.070 --> 04:13:56.080 align:start position:0%
type 2 diabetes but i don't necessarily
 
04:13:57.750 --> 04:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
feel at this time in my life i need a
 
04:13:59.510 --> 04:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
dog um
 
04:14:01.750 --> 04:14:01.760 align:start position:0%
there are people with type 1 diabetes i
 
04:14:03.590 --> 04:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
think they really do need a dog so i
 
04:14:04.950 --> 04:14:04.960 align:start position:0%
think there are
 
04:14:05.990 --> 04:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
people who
 
04:14:08.630 --> 04:14:08.640 align:start position:0%
who may have a need for a dog
 
04:14:11.349 --> 04:14:11.359 align:start position:0%
more than others and stacy is definitely
 
04:14:14.070 --> 04:14:14.080 align:start position:0%
one of them and um
 
04:14:16.950 --> 04:14:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:19.590 --> 04:14:19.600 align:start position:0%
you know trying to to get the dog
 
04:14:21.670 --> 04:14:21.680 align:start position:0%
into the workplace was quite difficult i
 
04:14:23.830 --> 04:14:23.840 align:start position:0%
had like i said lots of questions stacey
 
04:14:25.750 --> 04:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
had lots of questions and i had told
 
04:14:28.149 --> 04:14:28.159 align:start position:0%
them i said you know
 
04:14:28.159 --> 04:14:28.950 align:start position:0%
them i said you know
i

04:14:28.950 --> 04:14:28.960 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:14:31.110 --> 04:14:31.120 align:start position:0%
this is stuff that you shouldn't really
 
04:14:33.910 --> 04:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
be asking you know um
 
04:14:36.070 --> 04:14:36.080 align:start position:0%
you know the way i was training and all
 
04:14:37.670 --> 04:14:37.680 align:start position:0%
of that i said she could technically
 
04:14:39.670 --> 04:14:39.680 align:start position:0%
train the dog herself
 
04:14:41.189 --> 04:14:41.199 align:start position:0%
but she has chosen to go through a
 
04:14:43.750 --> 04:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
trainer but you know i felt if it made
 
04:14:46.469 --> 04:14:46.479 align:start position:0%
them happier so we could get the dog in
 
04:14:48.309 --> 04:14:48.319 align:start position:0%
i'll give them what they need
 
04:14:50.550 --> 04:14:50.560 align:start position:0%
but it was a lengthy process in long
 
04:14:53.910 --> 04:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
phone calls and lots of emails sometimes
 
04:14:56.229 --> 04:14:56.239 align:start position:0%
um just to explain stuff and they would
 
04:14:57.990 --> 04:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
always go back to their insurance
 
04:15:00.149 --> 04:15:00.159 align:start position:0%
companies needed this
 
04:15:01.750 --> 04:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
this is what their insurance that's what
 
04:15:04.550 --> 04:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
they all say but anyways um
 
04:15:07.110 --> 04:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
and the two workplaces stacy did have
 
04:15:09.590 --> 04:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
the dog in i supported her fully you
 
04:15:11.110 --> 04:15:11.120 align:start position:0%
know if there's any issues first getting
 
04:15:12.950 --> 04:15:12.960 align:start position:0%
the dog into the workplace just let me
 
04:15:14.309 --> 04:15:14.319 align:start position:0%
know because we can work on stuff if
 
04:15:16.389 --> 04:15:16.399 align:start position:0%
there's little things is he settling you
 
04:15:17.590 --> 04:15:17.600 align:start position:0%
know because he's got to spend a whole
 
04:15:19.910 --> 04:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
day with her um kind of hanging out it's
 
04:15:21.670 --> 04:15:21.680 align:start position:0%
not play time it's just hanging out and
 
04:15:24.469 --> 04:15:24.479 align:start position:0%
relaxing and being with with mom
 
04:15:25.990 --> 04:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:15:27.269 --> 04:15:27.279 align:start position:0%
i also
 
04:15:29.990 --> 04:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
another thing i had to work with
 
04:15:32.710 --> 04:15:32.720 align:start position:0%
or educate a little bit the employers
 
04:15:34.710 --> 04:15:34.720 align:start position:0%
who said okay well she can bring the dog
 
04:15:37.030 --> 04:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
but it's got to be in a room by itself
 
04:15:39.670 --> 04:15:39.680 align:start position:0%
and she so she can be out front and i
 
04:15:41.990 --> 04:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
said well what's the purpose of having
 
04:15:45.110 --> 04:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
the dog if it's going to be in a back
 
04:15:46.950 --> 04:15:46.960 align:start position:0%
room locked up
 
04:15:49.510 --> 04:15:49.520 align:start position:0%
and it has no access to her and they
 
04:15:51.590 --> 04:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
didn't get that they were like oh well
 
04:15:53.590 --> 04:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
she wants to bring her dog so keep it in
 
04:15:55.510 --> 04:15:55.520 align:start position:0%
the back room i said no the dog has to
 
04:15:58.229 --> 04:15:58.239 align:start position:0%
have access to her but anyhow so neither
 
04:16:01.030 --> 04:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
place did the dog ever have an issue
 
04:16:03.349 --> 04:16:03.359 align:start position:0%
neither employer ever contacted me and
 
04:16:05.269 --> 04:16:05.279 align:start position:0%
said we have an issue
 
04:16:07.030 --> 04:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
with this service dog or the dog is
 
04:16:08.790 --> 04:16:08.800 align:start position:0%
barking or the dog is misbehaved or
 
04:16:10.870 --> 04:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
there's an issue
 
04:16:13.189 --> 04:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
the dog was always fine
 
04:16:14.950 --> 04:16:14.960 align:start position:0%
but it's been lacy and we're going to
 
04:16:16.550 --> 04:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
have to wrap this up because we're way
 
04:16:18.229 --> 04:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
behind schedule and
 
04:16:21.189 --> 04:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:26.070 --> 04:16:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:26.080 --> 04:16:27.750 align:start position:0%
 
finally

04:16:27.750 --> 04:16:27.760 align:start position:0%
finally
 
04:16:29.750 --> 04:16:29.760 align:start position:0%

director of the governor's commission on
disability

04:16:56.469 --> 04:16:56.479 align:start position:0%
disability
 
04:16:59.269 --> 04:16:59.279 align:start position:0%
at the request of representative diane
 
04:17:00.950 --> 04:17:00.960 align:start position:0%
schuett i did have the opportunity to
 
04:17:03.110 --> 04:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
speak to the representative last week
 
04:17:06.630 --> 04:17:06.640 align:start position:0%
and look at the bill before you
 
04:17:08.550 --> 04:17:08.560 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day when you look at
 
04:17:10.229 --> 04:17:10.239 align:start position:0%
the amer the governor's commission on
 
04:17:12.550 --> 04:17:12.560 align:start position:0%
disability we're governed by obviously
 
04:17:13.670 --> 04:17:13.680 align:start position:0%
state law
 
04:17:15.429 --> 04:17:15.439 align:start position:0%
and the americans with disabilities act
 
04:17:16.469 --> 04:17:16.479 align:start position:0%
so we
 
04:17:18.070 --> 04:17:18.080 align:start position:0%
serve as a source of information and
 
04:17:21.269 --> 04:17:21.279 align:start position:0%
referral um among other things when it
 
04:17:24.149 --> 04:17:24.159 align:start position:0%
deals with the um ada
 
04:17:25.670 --> 04:17:25.680 align:start position:0%
according to the americans with
 
04:17:27.429 --> 04:17:27.439 align:start position:0%
disabilities act and
 
04:17:29.910 --> 04:17:29.920 align:start position:0%
state law is consistent with that a
 
04:17:31.910 --> 04:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
service animal is a dog so that's number
 
04:17:34.229 --> 04:17:34.239 align:start position:0%
one service animals are only dogs and
 
04:17:36.229 --> 04:17:36.239 align:start position:0%
they're specifically trained to perform
 
04:17:38.630 --> 04:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
a task for an individual with a
 
04:17:41.110 --> 04:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
disability all of the testimony you've
 
04:17:43.349 --> 04:17:43.359 align:start position:0%
heard before me
 
04:17:43.359 --> 04:17:44.790 align:start position:0%
heard before me
squarely

04:17:44.790 --> 04:17:44.800 align:start position:0%
squarely
 
04:17:47.269 --> 04:17:47.279 align:start position:0%
supplements that and speaks to the dogs
 
04:17:49.429 --> 04:17:49.439 align:start position:0%
in this room these are based upon what
 
04:17:51.110 --> 04:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
we've heard these are all service dogs
 
04:17:53.349 --> 04:17:53.359 align:start position:0%
because they are essentially they are
 
04:17:55.030 --> 04:17:55.040 align:start position:0%
performing a task
 
04:17:57.110 --> 04:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
that is directly related uh to a
 
04:17:59.510 --> 04:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
person's disability having said that
 
04:18:01.750 --> 04:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
when we look at the ada and we look at
 
04:18:06.070 --> 04:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
state law as enunciated in rsa 167
 
04:18:08.950 --> 04:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
um 167d the proposal before this
 
04:18:10.870 --> 04:18:10.880 align:start position:0%
honorable committee is consistent with
 
04:18:14.149 --> 04:18:14.159 align:start position:0%
state law and is consistent with the ada
 
04:18:16.550 --> 04:18:16.560 align:start position:0%
and quite honestly from a
 
04:18:19.269 --> 04:18:19.279 align:start position:0%
just a basic life perspective it'll make
 
04:18:22.309 --> 04:18:22.319 align:start position:0%
life a lot easier for individuals
 
04:18:24.309 --> 04:18:24.319 align:start position:0%
when we look at the amount of calls that
 
04:18:26.070 --> 04:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
come into the governor's commission on
 
04:18:26.080 --> 04:18:27.429 align:start position:0%
come into the governor's commission on
disability

04:18:27.429 --> 04:18:27.439 align:start position:0%
disability
 
04:18:29.670 --> 04:18:29.680 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of calls at the end of
 
04:18:31.110 --> 04:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
any month
 
04:18:33.110 --> 04:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
circle around service animals
 
04:18:35.429 --> 04:18:35.439 align:start position:0%
uh what is a service animal what is an
 
04:18:37.269 --> 04:18:37.279 align:start position:0%
emotional support animal what's a
 
04:18:40.630 --> 04:18:40.640 align:start position:0%
therapy animal is a therapy animal a um
 
04:18:44.149 --> 04:18:44.159 align:start position:0%
a service animal um and unfortunately i
 
04:18:46.070 --> 04:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
don't believe i'm telling this is
 
04:18:47.349 --> 04:18:47.359 align:start position:0%
nothing new
 
04:18:49.110 --> 04:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of abuses
 
04:18:51.590 --> 04:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
in the system and that is not
 
04:18:53.910 --> 04:18:53.920 align:start position:0%
just new hampshire it truly is a
 
04:18:56.469 --> 04:18:56.479 align:start position:0%
national concern when i sit in on
 
04:18:59.269 --> 04:18:59.279 align:start position:0%
national calls when i sit on calls
 
04:19:01.990 --> 04:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
with my new england counterparts
 
04:19:04.950 --> 04:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
service animals is a is a big issue and
 
04:19:07.590 --> 04:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
many people obviously um have to you
 
04:19:08.870 --> 04:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
know handle those questions so they
 
04:19:10.710 --> 04:19:10.720 align:start position:0%
direct them to the governor's commission
 
04:19:12.389 --> 04:19:12.399 align:start position:0%
on disability but the individuals here
 
04:19:13.830 --> 04:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
today have have
 
04:19:16.630 --> 04:19:16.640 align:start position:0%
said it squarely and poignantly
 
04:19:19.670 --> 04:19:19.680 align:start position:0%
this will make life easier for
 
04:19:21.590 --> 04:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
individuals who have diabetes because
 
04:19:23.910 --> 04:19:23.920 align:start position:0%
the dog is performing a task it's
 
04:19:25.429 --> 04:19:25.439 align:start position:0%
alerting the individual that there's
 
04:19:27.510 --> 04:19:27.520 align:start position:0%
something occurring um with a blood
 
04:19:30.870 --> 04:19:30.880 align:start position:0%
level um change so with that um we have
 
04:19:33.830 --> 04:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
a very robust website um the honorable
 
04:19:36.630 --> 04:19:36.640 align:start position:0%
representative um shut referenced it we
 
04:19:36.640 --> 04:19:37.349 align:start position:0%
representative um shut referenced it we
have

04:19:37.349 --> 04:19:37.359 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:19:39.750 --> 04:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
much literature on there many brochures
 
04:19:42.389 --> 04:19:42.399 align:start position:0%
we perform many presentations to both
 
04:19:44.630 --> 04:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
private and public sector individuals
 
04:19:46.149 --> 04:19:46.159 align:start position:0%
who are dealing with the issues with
 
04:19:48.550 --> 04:19:48.560 align:start position:0%
service animals so with that this uh
 
04:19:50.469 --> 04:19:50.479 align:start position:0%
proposal and this bill would be a good
 
04:19:52.309 --> 04:19:52.319 align:start position:0%
thing for the community so thank you how

04:22:43.030 --> 04:22:43.040 align:start position:0%
as the bill is currently drafted
 
04:22:45.990 --> 04:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
that would not change
 
04:22:47.830 --> 04:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
uh this bill furthermore allows for
 
04:22:49.510 --> 04:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
exceptions in cases where a health care
 
04:22:51.269 --> 04:22:51.279 align:start position:0%
provider has
 
04:22:53.030 --> 04:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
reason to believe in their professional
 
04:22:54.229 --> 04:22:54.239 align:start position:0%
judgment that the child has been
 
04:22:56.149 --> 04:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
subjected to domestic violence abuse or
 
04:22:56.159 --> 04:22:57.349 align:start position:0%
subjected to domestic violence abuse or
neglect

04:22:57.349 --> 04:22:57.359 align:start position:0%
neglect
 
04:22:59.670 --> 04:22:59.680 align:start position:0%
or if the release of those records could
 
04:23:02.630 --> 04:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
potentially endanger the child
 
04:23:05.349 --> 04:23:05.359 align:start position:0%
so as it stands today
 
04:23:07.349 --> 04:23:07.359 align:start position:0%
numerous healthcare providers including
 
04:23:09.429 --> 04:23:09.439 align:start position:0%
major hospitals in new hampshire have
 
04:23:13.110 --> 04:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
established a cutoff at 14 years
 
04:23:14.710 --> 04:23:14.720 align:start position:0%
and i
 
04:23:17.189 --> 04:23:17.199 align:start position:0%
i'm aware of several uh parents who were
 
04:23:19.349 --> 04:23:19.359 align:start position:0%
quite surprised to receive a letter from
 
04:23:21.030 --> 04:23:21.040 align:start position:0%
a health care provider stating that if
 
04:23:22.950 --> 04:23:22.960 align:start position:0%
they wanted continued access to their
 
04:23:24.630 --> 04:23:24.640 align:start position:0%
child's health care records after the
 
04:23:25.910 --> 04:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
age of 14
 
04:23:27.269 --> 04:23:27.279 align:start position:0%
that they would need to get the child's
 
04:23:30.070 --> 04:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
permission to do that
 
04:23:30.080 --> 04:23:31.189 align:start position:0%
permission to do that
um

04:23:31.189 --> 04:23:31.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:23:32.710 --> 04:23:32.720 align:start position:0%
in light of the current language in the
 
04:23:35.429 --> 04:23:35.439 align:start position:0%
rsa that recognizes the important role
 
04:23:38.229 --> 04:23:38.239 align:start position:0%
of of parents including the
 
04:23:40.469 --> 04:23:40.479 align:start position:0%
the responsibility for giving consent to
 
04:23:43.349 --> 04:23:43.359 align:start position:0%
medical procedures it seems somewhat odd
 
04:23:45.510 --> 04:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
that the same parent called upon to give
 
04:23:46.870 --> 04:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
that incent
 
04:23:49.429 --> 04:23:49.439 align:start position:0%
must do so potentially without access to
 
04:23:51.110 --> 04:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
the very medical records that would
 
04:23:53.590 --> 04:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
inform that decision
 
04:23:56.149 --> 04:23:56.159 align:start position:0%
so i hope i have done justice to
 
04:23:57.750 --> 04:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
representative gay's bill in this
 
04:23:59.750 --> 04:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
process i'll do my best to answer any
 
04:24:01.030 --> 04:24:01.040 align:start position:0%
questions that members of the committee
 
04:24:03.670 --> 04:24:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:06.309 --> 04:24:06.319 align:start position:0%
any questions for representative kofol
 
04:24:09.590 --> 04:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
pinshooting for representative gay
 
04:24:11.750 --> 04:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro thank you mr
 
04:24:11.760 --> 04:24:18.550 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro thank you mr
chairman

04:24:18.550 --> 04:24:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:20.469 --> 04:24:20.479 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that you'll be able to
 
04:24:23.349 --> 04:24:23.359 align:start position:0%
answer if this is not your bill but
 
04:24:24.950 --> 04:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
i'll answer and maybe there's someone
 
04:24:27.590 --> 04:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
else that coming after you then
 
04:24:27.600 --> 04:24:27.880 align:start position:0%
else that coming after you then
so

04:24:27.880 --> 04:24:27.890 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:24:27.890 --> 04:24:30.710 align:start position:0%
so
[Music]

04:24:30.710 --> 04:24:30.720 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:24:32.550 --> 04:24:32.560 align:start position:0%
first question is
 
04:24:32.560 --> 04:24:34.149 align:start position:0%
first question is
um

04:24:34.149 --> 04:24:34.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:36.229 --> 04:24:36.239 align:start position:0%
in crafting this bill has any thought
 
04:24:36.239 --> 04:24:37.110 align:start position:0%
in crafting this bill has any thought
been

04:24:37.110 --> 04:24:37.120 align:start position:0%
been
 
04:24:38.790 --> 04:24:38.800 align:start position:0%
given to
 
04:24:42.229 --> 04:24:42.239 align:start position:0%
consideration for exempting
 
04:24:44.309 --> 04:24:44.319 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder treatment which
 
04:24:47.510 --> 04:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
under current rsa is um
 
04:24:52.950 --> 04:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
someone can consent to at age 12.
 
04:24:54.870 --> 04:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
so i can't answer as to the thought
 
04:24:57.670 --> 04:24:57.680 align:start position:0%
process in in formulating this i will
 
04:24:58.630 --> 04:24:58.640 align:start position:0%
say that
 
04:24:58.640 --> 04:25:01.590 align:start position:0%
say that
hipaa

04:25:01.590 --> 04:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:02.870 --> 04:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
hipaa generally
 
04:25:05.110 --> 04:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
creates some some governing structure
 
04:25:07.750 --> 04:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
that that sits over top state statute
 
04:25:09.990 --> 04:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
and hipaa tends to defer to
 
04:25:11.269 --> 04:25:11.279 align:start position:0%
state law
 
04:25:13.910 --> 04:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
um however there are certain exceptions
 
04:25:15.830 --> 04:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
to that and one exception would be that
 
04:25:18.469 --> 04:25:18.479 align:start position:0%
if the minor is allowed by state law to
 
04:25:21.189 --> 04:25:21.199 align:start position:0%
give consent
 
04:25:23.910 --> 04:25:23.920 align:start position:0%
what and whether or not they have asked
 
04:25:23.920 --> 04:25:25.189 align:start position:0%
what and whether or not they have asked
for

04:25:25.189 --> 04:25:25.199 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:25:26.950 --> 04:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
their parent to be
 
04:25:28.950 --> 04:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
representing them as a medical
 
04:25:28.960 --> 04:25:30.950 align:start position:0%
representing them as a medical
representative

04:25:30.950 --> 04:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:25:32.790 --> 04:25:32.800 align:start position:0%
if they have not explicitly asked the
 
04:25:34.550 --> 04:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
parent to be a medical representative in
 
04:25:35.990 --> 04:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
that case
 
04:25:37.590 --> 04:25:37.600 align:start position:0%
i believe those are the circumstances in
 
04:25:40.790 --> 04:25:40.800 align:start position:0%
which hippa would regard those records
 
04:25:45.030 --> 04:25:45.040 align:start position:0%
to be confidential records excluded from
 
04:25:48.950 --> 04:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
being shared with the parent
 
04:25:50.550 --> 04:25:50.560 align:start position:0%
i think i think this
 
04:25:51.670 --> 04:25:51.680 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
04:25:53.750 --> 04:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
i think this is also alluded to in
 
04:25:55.030 --> 04:25:55.040 align:start position:0%
federal law
 
04:25:55.040 --> 04:25:56.229 align:start position:0%
federal law
um

04:25:56.229 --> 04:25:56.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:57.750 --> 04:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
the right to consent to treatment for
 
04:26:00.070 --> 04:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder treatment so i
 
04:26:02.149 --> 04:26:02.159 align:start position:0%
will i will pass that on to the sponsor
 
04:26:04.710 --> 04:26:04.720 align:start position:0%
of the bill correct i mean i i have a
 
04:26:06.070 --> 04:26:06.080 align:start position:0%
document which i can share with the
 
04:26:09.670 --> 04:26:09.680 align:start position:0%
committee um that that has a a table of
 
04:26:09.680 --> 04:26:11.750 align:start position:0%
committee um that that has a a table of
those

04:26:11.750 --> 04:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
those
 
04:26:13.510 --> 04:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
those categories of treatment for which
 
04:26:14.790 --> 04:26:14.800 align:start position:0%
a minor
 
04:26:17.269 --> 04:26:17.279 align:start position:0%
may consent to
 
04:26:19.750 --> 04:26:19.760 align:start position:0%
medical treatment or may consent with
 
04:26:22.389 --> 04:26:22.399 align:start position:0%
limitations so for emergency situations
 
04:26:25.030 --> 04:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
for example emergency treatment a minor
 
04:26:26.149 --> 04:26:26.159 align:start position:0%
may consent but there are some
 
04:26:28.950 --> 04:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
limitations to that for others having to
 
04:26:31.990 --> 04:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
do with stds and and
 
04:26:34.229 --> 04:26:34.239 align:start position:0%
mental health and some other issues
 
04:26:35.189 --> 04:26:35.199 align:start position:0%
there are
 
04:26:38.309 --> 04:26:38.319 align:start position:0%
broader um allowances for minors to give
 
04:26:39.990 --> 04:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
consent without the participation of a
 
04:26:40.000 --> 04:26:42.309 align:start position:0%
consent without the participation of a
parent

04:26:42.309 --> 04:26:42.319 align:start position:0%
parent
 
04:26:42.319 --> 04:26:43.189 align:start position:0%
parent
further

04:26:43.189 --> 04:26:43.199 align:start position:0%
further
 
04:26:45.030 --> 04:26:45.040 align:start position:0%
further follow-up yes
 
04:26:46.469 --> 04:26:46.479 align:start position:0%
so this is it really a different
 
04:26:46.479 --> 04:26:47.590 align:start position:0%
so this is it really a different
question

04:26:47.590 --> 04:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:26:47.600 --> 04:26:48.790 align:start position:0%
question
um

04:26:48.790 --> 04:26:48.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:26:51.830 --> 04:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
in section roman numeral two
 
04:26:54.149 --> 04:26:54.159 align:start position:0%
where it talks about another exception
 
04:26:54.159 --> 04:26:55.269 align:start position:0%
where it talks about another exception
being

04:26:55.269 --> 04:26:55.279 align:start position:0%
being
 
04:26:57.349 --> 04:26:57.359 align:start position:0%
that the health care provider reasonably
 
04:26:59.510 --> 04:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
believes in his or her
 
04:27:01.189 --> 04:27:01.199 align:start position:0%
professional judgment
 
04:27:03.110 --> 04:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
and then it goes on to
 
04:27:05.189 --> 04:27:05.199 align:start position:0%
create another exception
 
04:27:07.269 --> 04:27:07.279 align:start position:0%
you know in my experience working in my
 
04:27:09.830 --> 04:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
career as a mental health clinician this
 
04:27:09.840 --> 04:27:11.030 align:start position:0%
career as a mental health clinician this
issue

04:27:11.030 --> 04:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
issue
 
04:27:14.710 --> 04:27:14.720 align:start position:0%
of parents seeing a
 
04:27:18.630 --> 04:27:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:19.830 --> 04:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
unless there was some kind of
 
04:27:22.550 --> 04:27:22.560 align:start position:0%
contentious issue and
 
04:27:24.830 --> 04:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
so given
 
04:27:29.030 --> 04:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
that i'm wondering if this is um clear
 
04:27:29.040 --> 04:27:30.790 align:start position:0%
that i'm wondering if this is um clear
enough

04:27:30.790 --> 04:27:30.800 align:start position:0%
enough
 
04:27:32.710 --> 04:27:32.720 align:start position:0%
that the health care provider reasonably
 
04:27:34.870 --> 04:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
believes i'm i'm wondering how that will
 
04:27:34.880 --> 04:27:35.990 align:start position:0%
believes i'm i'm wondering how that will
actually

04:27:35.990 --> 04:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
actually
 
04:27:38.229 --> 04:27:38.239 align:start position:0%
what's the criteria for deciding that
 
04:27:40.309 --> 04:27:40.319 align:start position:0%
and once again i realize it's not your
 
04:27:43.110 --> 04:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
bill but i i wonder if that could be
 
04:27:44.950 --> 04:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
clarified i think that's that's good
 
04:27:46.630 --> 04:27:46.640 align:start position:0%
feedback and i would encourage you to
 
04:27:48.630 --> 04:27:48.640 align:start position:0%
share it with representative gay
 
04:27:50.870 --> 04:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
um i will comment that in my research
 
04:27:53.189 --> 04:27:53.199 align:start position:0%
for uh presenting this bill i did come
 
04:27:54.870 --> 04:27:54.880 align:start position:0%
across a case in which a seven in new
 
04:27:57.110 --> 04:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire in which a 17 year old
 
04:27:57.120 --> 04:27:58.469 align:start position:0%
hampshire in which a 17 year old
um

04:27:58.469 --> 04:27:58.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:28:00.790 --> 04:28:00.800 align:start position:0%
his father was
 
04:28:03.269 --> 04:28:03.279 align:start position:0%
seeking his mental health records uh
 
04:28:04.950 --> 04:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
because there was a contentious divorce
 
04:28:06.710 --> 04:28:06.720 align:start position:0%
going on and he wanted to understand
 
04:28:09.269 --> 04:28:09.279 align:start position:0%
what the son had been saying about
 
04:28:11.750 --> 04:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
the the wife in this case
 
04:28:11.760 --> 04:28:13.030 align:start position:0%
the the wife in this case
um

04:28:13.030 --> 04:28:13.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:28:15.110 --> 04:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
in that case the court upheld the
 
04:28:16.870 --> 04:28:16.880 align:start position:0%
privacy of his medical records and
 
04:28:19.030 --> 04:28:19.040 align:start position:0%
denied the father the the access to
 
04:28:21.030 --> 04:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
those records
 
04:28:23.110 --> 04:28:23.120 align:start position:0%
nevertheless i i think that
 
04:28:24.710 --> 04:28:24.720 align:start position:0%
what you bring up is is a very good
 
04:28:26.070 --> 04:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
point and
 
04:28:27.830 --> 04:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
um again i would encourage you to offer
 
04:28:29.590 --> 04:28:29.600 align:start position:0%
that feedback to representative gay as
 
04:28:33.349 --> 04:28:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:35.429 --> 04:28:35.439 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
04:28:37.670 --> 04:28:37.680 align:start position:0%
representative cushman
 
04:28:39.269 --> 04:28:39.279 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
04:28:40.790 --> 04:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for taking my question
 
04:28:44.070 --> 04:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
representative cofoul uh would you agree
 
04:28:46.469 --> 04:28:46.479 align:start position:0%
or would you believe that a parent
 
04:28:46.479 --> 04:28:47.269 align:start position:0%
or would you believe that a parent
would

04:28:47.269 --> 04:28:47.279 align:start position:0%
would
 
04:28:48.630 --> 04:28:48.640 align:start position:0%
seek access
 
04:28:51.110 --> 04:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
to their children's medical record
 
04:28:52.950 --> 04:28:52.960 align:start position:0%
not only when there's a contentious
 
04:28:54.710 --> 04:28:54.720 align:start position:0%
issue but also
 
04:28:57.189 --> 04:28:57.199 align:start position:0%
to be an active participant in their
 
04:29:00.070 --> 04:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
child's health and well-being
 
04:29:00.080 --> 04:29:01.750 align:start position:0%
child's health and well-being
um

04:29:01.750 --> 04:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:29:04.630 --> 04:29:04.640 align:start position:0%
yes and what's what's quite surprising
 
04:29:05.830 --> 04:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
is the
 
04:29:08.149 --> 04:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
this the default position that many
 
04:29:10.070 --> 04:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
healthcare providers and healthcare
 
04:29:12.070 --> 04:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
organizations in the state seem to have
 
04:29:12.080 --> 04:29:13.189 align:start position:0%
organizations in the state seem to have
taken

04:29:13.189 --> 04:29:13.199 align:start position:0%
taken
 
04:29:15.349 --> 04:29:15.359 align:start position:0%
is that
 
04:29:16.870 --> 04:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
age 14
 
04:29:20.070 --> 04:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
is sort of the blanket cut off at which
 
04:29:22.070 --> 04:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
records should no longer be accessible
 
04:29:23.750 --> 04:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
to parents by default in other words
 
04:29:25.590 --> 04:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
they're not managing that as an
 
04:29:27.349 --> 04:29:27.359 align:start position:0%
exception they're managing it as the
 
04:29:27.359 --> 04:29:28.309 align:start position:0%
exception they're managing it as the
rule

04:29:28.309 --> 04:29:28.319 align:start position:0%
rule
 
04:29:30.469 --> 04:29:30.479 align:start position:0%
and i think that's what this bill is
 
04:29:32.870 --> 04:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
primarily intended to address
 
04:29:32.880 --> 04:29:33.830 align:start position:0%
primarily intended to address
um

04:29:33.830 --> 04:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:29:35.510 --> 04:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
you know i i know that there are also
 
04:29:37.910 --> 04:29:37.920 align:start position:0%
some differences as to how
 
04:29:40.309 --> 04:29:40.319 align:start position:0%
medical records are handled under ferpa
 
04:29:43.189 --> 04:29:43.199 align:start position:0%
versus under hipaa so if medical care
 
04:29:48.149 --> 04:29:48.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:50.309 --> 04:29:50.319 align:start position:0%
it is not protected by hipaa and many of
 
04:29:52.710 --> 04:29:52.720 align:start position:0%
the hipaa rules don't apply so it can
 
04:29:55.349 --> 04:29:55.359 align:start position:0%
get to be a very complex issue
 
04:29:57.830 --> 04:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
i think the concern is that the the law
 
04:30:00.870 --> 04:30:00.880 align:start position:0%
new hampshire law is is currently
 
04:30:04.149 --> 04:30:04.159 align:start position:0%
quite ambiguous with respect to
 
04:30:06.790 --> 04:30:06.800 align:start position:0%
access to medical records by parents and
 
04:30:08.309 --> 04:30:08.319 align:start position:0%
i think that that is probably a
 
04:30:10.149 --> 04:30:10.159 align:start position:0%
disservice to
 
04:30:12.469 --> 04:30:12.479 align:start position:0%
many of the medical organizations who
 
04:30:14.149 --> 04:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
have to grapple with this issue and find
 
04:30:16.389 --> 04:30:16.399 align:start position:0%
their own way
 
04:30:18.149 --> 04:30:18.159 align:start position:0%
and i think it's certainly a disservice
 
04:30:19.750 --> 04:30:19.760 align:start position:0%
to parents who are taking an active
 
04:30:21.110 --> 04:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
interest in their in their children's
 
04:30:21.120 --> 04:30:27.030 align:start position:0%
interest in their in their children's
well-being

04:30:27.030 --> 04:30:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:28.710 --> 04:30:28.720 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions thank you so
 
04:30:31.269 --> 04:30:31.279 align:start position:0%
much thank you the chair recognizes
 
04:30:33.990 --> 04:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
shannon mcginley to speak in favor of
 
04:30:45.510 --> 04:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:47.349 --> 04:30:47.359 align:start position:0%
hello committee my name is shannon
 
04:30:49.990 --> 04:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
mcginley and i am
 
04:30:51.750 --> 04:30:51.760 align:start position:0%
the executive director volunteer
 
04:30:53.269 --> 04:30:53.279 align:start position:0%
executive director of cornerstone action
 
04:30:55.510 --> 04:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire i live in bedford
 
04:30:59.189 --> 04:30:59.199 align:start position:0%
and i am in support of this bill um
 
04:31:01.590 --> 04:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
because i interestingly when i heard
 
04:31:03.750 --> 04:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
about the bill i had a personal story
 
04:31:06.149 --> 04:31:06.159 align:start position:0%
with it and i'll i'm gonna email you all
 
04:31:08.550 --> 04:31:08.560 align:start position:0%
this letter that i received back
 
04:31:11.349 --> 04:31:11.359 align:start position:0%
actually in 2012 from
 
04:31:14.070 --> 04:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
elliott hospital physicians network
 
04:31:16.710 --> 04:31:16.720 align:start position:0%
notifying me it was my pediatrician's
 
04:31:19.429 --> 04:31:19.439 align:start position:0%
office notifying me that
 
04:31:22.149 --> 04:31:22.159 align:start position:0%
i would no longer have access to my
 
04:31:25.510 --> 04:31:25.520 align:start position:0%
children's records with the exception of
 
04:31:27.590 --> 04:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
a couple things like immunization
 
04:31:31.269 --> 04:31:31.279 align:start position:0%
records and i was obviously very upset
 
04:31:34.389 --> 04:31:34.399 align:start position:0%
by receiving this letter and a number of
 
04:31:36.309 --> 04:31:36.319 align:start position:0%
my friends were also in the same
 
04:31:38.550 --> 04:31:38.560 align:start position:0%
practice and we were like what you know
 
04:31:40.469 --> 04:31:40.479 align:start position:0%
what is this all about and it does make
 
04:31:44.149 --> 04:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
reference in the letter um that the um
 
04:31:45.750 --> 04:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
that these restrictions are being put in
 
04:31:48.309 --> 04:31:48.319 align:start position:0%
place by the elliott health system um
 
04:31:50.550 --> 04:31:50.560 align:start position:0%
widely wide policy which has been set in
 
04:31:53.030 --> 04:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
accordance with new hampshire state law
 
04:31:56.149 --> 04:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
and um and it has on there a chart that
 
04:31:57.910 --> 04:31:57.920 align:start position:0%
you might find interesting and you know
 
04:32:00.309 --> 04:32:00.319 align:start position:0%
i realize that this is from 2012 this
 
04:32:02.229 --> 04:32:02.239 align:start position:0%
letter but you know there could have
 
04:32:04.389 --> 04:32:04.399 align:start position:0%
been some modifications to how this law
 
04:32:06.710 --> 04:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
is being interpreted but it has a chart
 
04:32:08.870 --> 04:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
on the second page of the letter where
 
04:32:12.070 --> 04:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
it lays out what my what i will have
 
04:32:14.550 --> 04:32:14.560 align:start position:0%
access to versus what my child will have
 
04:32:17.269 --> 04:32:17.279 align:start position:0%
access to in their or online portal
 
04:32:19.670 --> 04:32:19.680 align:start position:0%
and i have to tell you so some of you
 
04:32:22.070 --> 04:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
know that i have five sons and it's
 
04:32:24.070 --> 04:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
comical to me to think in this letter
 
04:32:27.030 --> 04:32:27.040 align:start position:0%
talks about 12 to 18 year olds that my
 
04:32:31.830 --> 04:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
12 13 14 15 even 16 and 17 year old
 
04:32:33.910 --> 04:32:33.920 align:start position:0%
would be able to navigate this online
 
04:32:37.030 --> 04:32:37.040 align:start position:0%
portal with their healthcare information
 
04:32:39.830 --> 04:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
and that i would be blocked out from
 
04:32:42.550 --> 04:32:42.560 align:start position:0%
that and um
 
04:32:44.870 --> 04:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
so i just i think that we need to
 
04:32:47.269 --> 04:32:47.279 align:start position:0%
reevaluate this new hampshire state law
 
04:32:50.149 --> 04:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
that is blocking parents out from them
 
04:32:52.229 --> 04:32:52.239 align:start position:0%
having access to what i believe to be
 
04:32:53.990 --> 04:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
critical information in order to
 
04:32:55.750 --> 04:32:55.760 align:start position:0%
determine what's best for their health
 
04:32:57.910 --> 04:32:57.920 align:start position:0%
care i'm happy to take any questions i
 
04:33:00.870 --> 04:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
have a question does this sound like to
 
04:33:03.189 --> 04:33:03.199 align:start position:0%
you yet
 
04:33:05.269 --> 04:33:05.279 align:start position:0%
another example
 
04:33:05.279 --> 04:33:07.109 align:start position:0%
another example
of

04:33:07.109 --> 04:33:07.119 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:33:09.029 --> 04:33:09.039 align:start position:0%
the man
 
04:33:11.029 --> 04:33:11.039 align:start position:0%
wanting to run our kids and not the
 
04:33:11.039 --> 04:33:12.629 align:start position:0%
wanting to run our kids and not the
parents

04:33:12.629 --> 04:33:12.639 align:start position:0%
parents
 
04:33:14.629 --> 04:33:14.639 align:start position:0%
well i definitely feel that over the
 
04:33:17.029 --> 04:33:17.039 align:start position:0%
years i have children five to 25 i feel
 
04:33:19.109 --> 04:33:19.119 align:start position:0%
like there's been a continual erosion of
 
04:33:21.670 --> 04:33:21.680 align:start position:0%
my rights as a parent in their lives and
 
04:33:25.189 --> 04:33:25.199 align:start position:0%
that i feel sometimes like a traffic cop
 
04:33:27.590 --> 04:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
standing at a five-way intersection you
 
04:33:29.189 --> 04:33:29.199 align:start position:0%
know trying to
 
04:33:31.189 --> 04:33:31.199 align:start position:0%
trying to protect them because i feel
 
04:33:34.070 --> 04:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
like that it's just a constant attack um
 
04:33:36.390 --> 04:33:36.400 align:start position:0%
you know on our family's privacy and our
 
04:33:38.310 --> 04:33:38.320 align:start position:0%
decisions of what we feel is best for
 
04:33:41.990 --> 04:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
our family and my follow-up is and yet
 
04:33:43.910 --> 04:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
you still are responsible for them
 
04:33:47.109 --> 04:33:47.119 align:start position:0%
financially yes that is correct and
 
04:33:49.670 --> 04:33:49.680 align:start position:0%
there was a great example of that most
 
04:33:52.789 --> 04:33:52.799 align:start position:0%
recently um with one of my sons that you
 
04:33:54.470 --> 04:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
know something happened
 
04:33:56.789 --> 04:33:56.799 align:start position:0%
and i didn't know anything about it
 
04:33:58.789 --> 04:33:58.799 align:start position:0%
until i got the bill
 
04:34:00.310 --> 04:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:34:02.390 --> 04:34:02.400 align:start position:0%
and so i was like
 
04:34:03.910 --> 04:34:03.920 align:start position:0%
do you want to talk about this what is
 
04:34:04.949 --> 04:34:04.959 align:start position:0%
this all about
 
04:34:07.429 --> 04:34:07.439 align:start position:0%
you know and i just i just i find there
 
04:34:09.910 --> 04:34:09.920 align:start position:0%
to be such an unbelievable disconnect
 
04:34:12.470 --> 04:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
with the way our system works yes
 
04:34:14.789 --> 04:34:14.799 align:start position:0%
they you know in a number of different
 
04:34:17.349 --> 04:34:17.359 align:start position:0%
scenarios they could be having side
 
04:34:19.670 --> 04:34:19.680 align:start position:0%
effects from medication or a procedure
 
04:34:22.789 --> 04:34:22.799 align:start position:0%
perhaps that they underwent and they
 
04:34:24.869 --> 04:34:24.879 align:start position:0%
could be upstairs in their bedroom or
 
04:34:26.869 --> 04:34:26.879 align:start position:0%
their bathroom
 
04:34:28.789 --> 04:34:28.799 align:start position:0%
bleeding or dealing with whatever side
 
04:34:30.629 --> 04:34:30.639 align:start position:0%
effect may come from it and i have no
 
04:34:33.670 --> 04:34:33.680 align:start position:0%
idea what's going on
 
04:34:35.670 --> 04:34:35.680 align:start position:0%
any further questions for the rep for
 
04:34:39.590 --> 04:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:41.189 --> 04:34:41.199 align:start position:0%
ms mcginley
 
04:34:44.789 --> 04:34:44.799 align:start position:0%
yes please representative merchant
 
04:34:46.551 --> 04:34:46.561 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
04:34:48.789 --> 04:34:48.799 align:start position:0%
a question about the um access to the
 
04:34:51.269 --> 04:34:51.279 align:start position:0%
medical record of the child
 
04:34:52.949 --> 04:34:52.959 align:start position:0%
was that something the child requested
 
04:34:54.310 --> 04:34:54.320 align:start position:0%
or is that something the medical center
 
04:34:56.949 --> 04:34:56.959 align:start position:0%
or the physicians practice automatically
 
04:34:58.310 --> 04:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
put into place
 
04:35:00.230 --> 04:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
the practice automatically put in place
 
04:35:02.551 --> 04:35:02.561 align:start position:0%
per new hampshire state law if i want to
 
04:35:04.551 --> 04:35:04.561 align:start position:0%
be able to get access to those other
 
04:35:06.390 --> 04:35:06.400 align:start position:0%
records then my child has to give
 
04:35:09.830 --> 04:35:09.840 align:start position:0%
permission which in my situation is not
 
04:35:12.470 --> 04:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
an issue to be able to talk to my child
 
04:35:14.310 --> 04:35:14.320 align:start position:0%
to get my 12 year old to give me
 
04:35:17.750 --> 04:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
permission to their medical records
 
04:35:17.760 --> 04:35:20.830 align:start position:0%
permission to their medical records
follow

04:35:20.830 --> 04:35:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:23.590 --> 04:35:23.600 align:start position:0%
up want to be clear i understand this
 
04:35:25.189 --> 04:35:25.199 align:start position:0%
name is more towards the
 
04:35:27.349 --> 04:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
fault whether it's prime sponsor but
 
04:35:29.109 --> 04:35:29.119 align:start position:0%
when you're looking for the
 
04:35:31.269 --> 04:35:31.279 align:start position:0%
record access
 
04:35:34.310 --> 04:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
the child does not have to
 
04:35:36.070 --> 04:35:36.080 align:start position:0%
opt in or opt opt-out of providing
 
04:35:37.910 --> 04:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
access is automatically granted to the
 
04:35:37.920 --> 04:35:39.750 align:start position:0%
access is automatically granted to the
child

04:35:39.750 --> 04:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
child
 
04:35:41.349 --> 04:35:41.359 align:start position:0%
it's otherwise the child is not saying i
 
04:35:42.789 --> 04:35:42.799 align:start position:0%
don't want my parents to have access to
 
04:35:45.189 --> 04:35:45.199 align:start position:0%
the record the facilities automatically
 
04:35:47.029 --> 04:35:47.039 align:start position:0%
making that judgment call yes that's
 
04:35:49.029 --> 04:35:49.039 align:start position:0%
correct i think i'm tracking with you
 
04:35:50.470 --> 04:35:50.480 align:start position:0%
i'm kind of having a difficult time
 
04:35:51.830 --> 04:35:51.840 align:start position:0%
understanding sorry about that i just
 
04:35:52.869 --> 04:35:52.879 align:start position:0%
want to be sure that i understand it
 
04:35:54.949 --> 04:35:54.959 align:start position:0%
correctly that it wasn't the child who
 
04:35:57.269 --> 04:35:57.279 align:start position:0%
requested the medical record access to
 
04:35:59.109 --> 04:35:59.119 align:start position:0%
be blocked it was being done because of
 
04:36:00.629 --> 04:36:00.639 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the law that is
 
04:36:03.670 --> 04:36:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:05.510 --> 04:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
any further questions yes representative

thank you mr chairman just a quick
 
04:36:10.869 --> 04:36:10.879 align:start position:0%
question uh
 
04:36:12.551 --> 04:36:12.561 align:start position:0%
what age was your child when you got
 
04:36:13.910 --> 04:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
that letter from the pediatrician's
 
04:36:16.869 --> 04:36:16.879 align:start position:0%
office was that at age 12 or 14 or
 
04:36:18.551 --> 04:36:18.561 align:start position:0%
well i have multiple children i have
 
04:36:19.910 --> 04:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
five so i don't know if you want me to
 
04:36:21.990 --> 04:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
go through the list probably not but um
 
04:36:24.150 --> 04:36:24.160 align:start position:0%
it it i mean i'd have to do the math of
 
04:36:25.990 --> 04:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
like what each one of them were because
 
04:36:28.310 --> 04:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
at that time i had five in that practice
 
04:36:29.429 --> 04:36:29.439 align:start position:0%
that were mine i guess i'm just
 
04:36:33.189 --> 04:36:33.199 align:start position:0%
wondering at what age um what currently
 
04:36:34.551 --> 04:36:34.561 align:start position:0%
do you lose
 
04:36:37.349 --> 04:36:37.359 align:start position:0%
well well this letter said 12.
 
04:36:39.429 --> 04:36:39.439 align:start position:0%
and and i i'm gonna take a picture of
 
04:36:41.189 --> 04:36:41.199 align:start position:0%
this and or scan it and send it to you
 
04:36:47.029 --> 04:36:47.039 align:start position:0%

representing all our community hospitals
 
04:37:18.709 --> 04:37:18.719 align:start position:0%
as well as our specialty hospitals we
 
04:37:20.990 --> 04:37:21.000 align:start position:0%
have concerns with house bill
 
04:37:23.429 --> 04:37:23.439 align:start position:0%
1345 relative to the release of
 
04:37:26.470 --> 04:37:26.480 align:start position:0%
teenagers medical records to a parent or
 
04:37:28.789 --> 04:37:28.799 align:start position:0%
guardian we do not believe that this
 
04:37:31.029 --> 04:37:31.039 align:start position:0%
bill is necessary as
 
04:37:33.269 --> 04:37:33.279 align:start position:0%
hipaa as previously stated already
 
04:37:35.189 --> 04:37:35.199 align:start position:0%
covers when a minor's medical records
 
04:37:37.910 --> 04:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
can be released in addition we believe
 
04:37:40.709 --> 04:37:40.719 align:start position:0%
house bill 1345 as drafted is missing a
 
04:37:43.029 --> 04:37:43.039 align:start position:0%
critical component of what is available
 
04:37:45.349 --> 04:37:45.359 align:start position:0%
or allowable i should say under hipaa
 
04:37:47.670 --> 04:37:47.680 align:start position:0%
the critical component that is missing
 
04:37:50.230 --> 04:37:50.240 align:start position:0%
is called confidential communications we
 
04:37:51.830 --> 04:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
know that adolescent health care
 
04:37:54.470 --> 04:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
providers rely heavily on the provision
 
04:37:56.390 --> 04:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
to have important conversations with
 
04:37:58.470 --> 04:37:58.480 align:start position:0%
their adolescent parent patients excuse
 
04:38:01.510 --> 04:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
me that may be stifled if not permitted
 
04:38:02.869 --> 04:38:02.879 align:start position:0%
there is an agreement between the
 
04:38:04.629 --> 04:38:04.639 align:start position:0%
provider the patient and the personal
 
04:38:06.310 --> 04:38:06.320 align:start position:0%
representative that the conversation
 
04:38:08.470 --> 04:38:08.480 align:start position:0%
will remain between the provider and the
 
04:38:10.470 --> 04:38:10.480 align:start position:0%
adolescent parent patient
 
04:38:12.310 --> 04:38:12.320 align:start position:0%
which the provider documents in the
 
04:38:14.150 --> 04:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
chart and it is then noted in the
 
04:38:14.160 --> 04:38:15.189 align:start position:0%
chart and it is then noted in the
patient's

04:38:15.189 --> 04:38:15.199 align:start position:0%
patient's
 
04:38:17.029 --> 04:38:17.039 align:start position:0%
electronic medical record that it cannot
 
04:38:18.230 --> 04:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
be shared
 
04:38:20.949 --> 04:38:20.959 align:start position:0%
i attached an faq from the um in the
 
04:38:23.830 --> 04:38:23.840 align:start position:0%
back of my testimony on the um from the
 
04:38:26.949 --> 04:38:26.959 align:start position:0%
us hhs website describing how hipaa
 
04:38:30.470 --> 04:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
manages access to miners medical records
 
04:38:32.390 --> 04:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
this is how all health care providers in
 
04:38:33.990 --> 04:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire currently manage these
 
04:38:36.230 --> 04:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
situations in support of a minor the
 
04:38:37.910 --> 04:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
parents guardians and the health care
 
04:38:37.920 --> 04:38:39.029 align:start position:0%
parents guardians and the health care
provider

04:38:39.029 --> 04:38:39.039 align:start position:0%
provider
 
04:38:41.670 --> 04:38:41.680 align:start position:0%
in addition this bill only refers to one
 
04:38:43.990 --> 04:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
section of new hampshire law pertaining
 
04:38:46.070 --> 04:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
to sexually transmitted disease
 
04:38:48.070 --> 04:38:48.080 align:start position:0%
treatments for adolescents
 
04:38:50.470 --> 04:38:50.480 align:start position:0%
aged 14 or older there are other
 
04:38:52.949 --> 04:38:52.959 align:start position:0%
statutes that afford minors as young as
 
04:38:55.269 --> 04:38:55.279 align:start position:0%
12 years of age the ability to consent
 
04:38:56.949 --> 04:38:56.959 align:start position:0%
to treatments without the knowledge or
 
04:38:59.029 --> 04:38:59.039 align:start position:0%
consent of a parent or guardian
 
04:39:01.269 --> 04:39:01.279 align:start position:0%
therefore this bill is only limited in
 
04:39:03.590 --> 04:39:03.600 align:start position:0%
scope and would create more uncertainty
 
04:39:06.390 --> 04:39:06.400 align:start position:0%
for when and how minors can consent
 
04:39:08.949 --> 04:39:08.959 align:start position:0%
to release of medical records for these
 
04:39:11.510 --> 04:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
reasons we are not supportive of this
 
04:39:14.390 --> 04:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
bill um and we i thank you for allowing
 
04:39:16.230 --> 04:39:16.240 align:start position:0%
me to make my comments would you take
 
04:39:22.551 --> 04:39:22.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:24.629 --> 04:39:24.639 align:start position:0%
thank you uh chairman pearson and thank
 
04:39:27.189 --> 04:39:27.199 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um do you
 
04:39:30.789 --> 04:39:30.799 align:start position:0%
ever have situations where
 
04:39:33.670 --> 04:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
um the child is seeking a test or
 
04:39:35.349 --> 04:39:35.359 align:start position:0%
treatment for something especially if
 
04:39:36.869 --> 04:39:36.879 align:start position:0%
they're going to be given a drug of any
 
04:39:36.879 --> 04:39:37.830 align:start position:0%
they're going to be given a drug of any
kind

04:39:37.830 --> 04:39:37.840 align:start position:0%
kind
 
04:39:39.750 --> 04:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
and they didn't have the wherewithal to
 
04:39:41.590 --> 04:39:41.600 align:start position:0%
remember all the medications they
 
04:39:43.830 --> 04:39:43.840 align:start position:0%
currently are taking
 
04:39:43.840 --> 04:39:44.868 align:start position:0%
currently are taking
and

04:39:44.868 --> 04:39:44.878 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:39:47.510 --> 04:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
have possible side effects from other
 
04:39:47.520 --> 04:39:49.590 align:start position:0%
have possible side effects from other
issues

04:39:49.590 --> 04:39:49.600 align:start position:0%
issues
 
04:39:52.550 --> 04:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
i am not a health information management
 
04:39:55.510 --> 04:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
director but we consulted our hymns
 
04:39:57.990 --> 04:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
directors um in in crafting this
 
04:40:01.190 --> 04:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
testimony they um provided us and i can
 
04:40:02.390 --> 04:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
submit it to the
 
04:40:05.750 --> 04:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
committee a chart of when um what what
 
04:40:08.070 --> 04:40:08.080 align:start position:0%
laws they do follow um relative to when
 
04:40:10.948 --> 04:40:10.958 align:start position:0%
they provide information um and allowed
 
04:40:13.510 --> 04:40:13.520 align:start position:0%
to provide information um so i will
 
04:40:14.948 --> 04:40:14.958 align:start position:0%
forward that along
 
04:40:17.030 --> 04:40:17.040 align:start position:0%

04:40:19.030 --> 04:40:19.040 align:start position:0%

chairman and thank you for taking the
 
04:40:29.270 --> 04:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
question my question comes to these
 
04:40:31.670 --> 04:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
confidential communications are those
 
04:40:34.070 --> 04:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
simply confidential to the parent or are
 
04:40:35.190 --> 04:40:35.200 align:start position:0%
those also
 
04:40:37.030 --> 04:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
also confidential to anybody else
 
04:40:39.270 --> 04:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
inquiring about the child's medical
 
04:40:39.280 --> 04:40:40.230 align:start position:0%
inquiring about the child's medical
record

04:40:40.230 --> 04:40:40.240 align:start position:0%
record
 
04:40:42.788 --> 04:40:42.798 align:start position:0%
it indicates in the medical record that
 
04:40:44.708 --> 04:40:44.718 align:start position:0%
it cannot be shared and that was my last
 
04:40:44.718 --> 04:40:45.510 align:start position:0%
it cannot be shared and that was my last
um

04:40:45.510 --> 04:40:45.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:47.590 --> 04:40:47.600 align:start position:0%
the last statement in that paragraph so
 
04:40:48.948 --> 04:40:48.958 align:start position:0%
it cannot be shared
 
04:40:50.550 --> 04:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
sorry and follow up with anybody not

1345 before we start the next one in
 
04:41:12.550 --> 04:41:12.560 align:start position:0%
about a minute
 
04:41:15.110 --> 04:41:15.120 align:start position:0%
a few announcements that have come out
 
04:41:17.910 --> 04:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
of the meeting this morning of the
 
04:41:20.070 --> 04:41:20.080 align:start position:0%
committee chairs
 
04:41:22.390 --> 04:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
and i realize not everybody is is here
 
04:41:25.510 --> 04:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
so take notes for those who aren't
 
04:41:29.830 --> 04:41:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:32.788 --> 04:41:32.798 align:start position:0%
will be sometime during the week of
 
04:41:36.550 --> 04:41:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:40.390 --> 04:41:40.400 align:start position:0%
at a location to be determined
 
04:41:43.750 --> 04:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
someday during that week
 
04:41:46.948 --> 04:41:46.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:49.990 --> 04:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
early bills those are bills that have to
 
04:41:52.550 --> 04:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
go to a second committee
 
04:41:55.750 --> 04:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
usually if there's a fiscal note but not
 
04:41:55.760 --> 04:41:56.948 align:start position:0%
usually if there's a fiscal note but not
always

04:41:56.948 --> 04:41:56.958 align:start position:0%
always
 
04:42:00.310 --> 04:42:00.320 align:start position:0%
early bills now the deadline is thursday
 
04:42:04.390 --> 04:42:04.400 align:start position:0%
february 10th at noon
 
04:42:07.510 --> 04:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
which means committees with either a lot
 
04:42:08.708 --> 04:42:08.718 align:start position:0%
of bills
 
04:42:11.270 --> 04:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
or controversial bills that the hearings
 
04:42:13.910 --> 04:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
of which may last quite a while
 
04:42:15.430 --> 04:42:15.440 align:start position:0%
or both
 
04:42:18.470 --> 04:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
are really going to have to push it
 
04:42:20.708 --> 04:42:20.718 align:start position:0%
i know that many bills will come out of
 
04:42:23.750 --> 04:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
here now 11 to 10 such is the nature of
 
04:42:27.510 --> 04:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
things but whenever possible
 
04:42:29.350 --> 04:42:29.360 align:start position:0%
if we can put it on consent in other
 
04:42:31.590 --> 04:42:31.600 align:start position:0%
words if somebody was well i'm not too
 
04:42:33.830 --> 04:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
sure i like it and you make it 20 to 1.
 
04:42:35.270 --> 04:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
i understand that you certainly have the
 
04:42:37.750 --> 04:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
right to do so but the more bills we get
 
04:42:40.070 --> 04:42:40.080 align:start position:0%
on consent
 
04:42:42.070 --> 04:42:42.080 align:start position:0%
the more we will be able to get our work
 
04:42:43.990 --> 04:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
done by the deadlines that we have in
 
04:42:47.830 --> 04:42:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:50.390 --> 04:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
substitutes can participate in the
 
04:42:53.190 --> 04:42:53.200 align:start position:0%
debate and in the vote
 
04:42:55.110 --> 04:42:55.120 align:start position:0%
but they cannot make a motion or write a
 
04:42:56.868 --> 04:42:56.878 align:start position:0%
report i think we all know that we need
 
04:42:59.590 --> 04:42:59.600 align:start position:0%
to be reminded that some time
 
04:43:02.948 --> 04:43:02.958 align:start position:0%
although our present policy is still no
 
04:43:04.868 --> 04:43:04.878 align:start position:0%
zoom meetings
 
04:43:07.270 --> 04:43:07.280 align:start position:0%
for committee hearings
 
04:43:09.350 --> 04:43:09.360 align:start position:0%
you can always
 
04:43:12.390 --> 04:43:12.400 align:start position:0%
text someone who is in the room to ask a
 
04:43:12.400 --> 04:43:14.150 align:start position:0%
text someone who is in the room to ask a
question

04:43:14.150 --> 04:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:43:15.910 --> 04:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
representative canuck and i have some
 
04:43:18.150 --> 04:43:18.160 align:start position:0%
stories about how we worked around that
 
04:43:21.750 --> 04:43:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:24.230 --> 04:43:24.240 align:start position:0%
if we have an open spot in the schedule
 
04:43:26.708 --> 04:43:26.718 align:start position:0%
that is to say as
 
04:43:28.948 --> 04:43:28.958 align:start position:0%
the ranking member told me from her many
 
04:43:32.550 --> 04:43:32.560 align:start position:0%
years of experience you are convinced
 
04:43:34.708 --> 04:43:34.718 align:start position:0%
a bill will take a half an hour in a
 
04:43:34.718 --> 04:43:35.990 align:start position:0%
a bill will take a half an hour in a
hearing

04:43:35.990 --> 04:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
04:43:38.150 --> 04:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
and it's done in 12 minutes
 
04:43:42.310 --> 04:43:42.320 align:start position:0%
or two hours it's not always easy to to
 
04:43:42.320 --> 04:43:43.270 align:start position:0%
or two hours it's not always easy to to
guess

04:43:43.270 --> 04:43:43.280 align:start position:0%
guess
 
04:43:47.830 --> 04:43:47.840 align:start position:0%
but if we have some open spots coming up
 
04:43:51.990 --> 04:43:52.000 align:start position:0%
i'd like to fill them with exec sessions
 
04:43:53.350 --> 04:43:53.360 align:start position:0%
unless you want to come back yet an
 
04:43:56.470 --> 04:43:56.480 align:start position:0%
extra day in the week
 
04:43:59.510 --> 04:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
so therefore those of us from this
 
04:44:01.750 --> 04:44:01.760 align:start position:0%
session today and from the last time
 
04:44:03.110 --> 04:44:03.120 align:start position:0%
times we've met
 
04:44:04.628 --> 04:44:04.638 align:start position:0%
where we say oh i think i want to bring
 
04:44:06.230 --> 04:44:06.240 align:start position:0%
an amendment in that's a pretty good
 
04:44:07.990 --> 04:44:08.000 align:start position:0%
bill but i'd like to bring an amendment
 
04:44:10.310 --> 04:44:10.320 align:start position:0%
in please work on those as quickly as
 
04:44:11.510 --> 04:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
you can
 
04:44:12.708 --> 04:44:12.718 align:start position:0%
because if
 
04:44:14.550 --> 04:44:14.560 align:start position:0%
every bill that
 
04:44:16.868 --> 04:44:16.878 align:start position:0%
is pending has an amendment we're
 
04:44:18.230 --> 04:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
waiting for
 
04:44:20.390 --> 04:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
then we're going to burn that
 
04:44:21.910 --> 04:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
free time
 
04:44:24.788 --> 04:44:24.798 align:start position:0%
before the next bill is advertised so
 
04:44:30.230 --> 04:44:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:30.240 --> 04:44:31.830 align:start position:0%
 
and

04:44:31.830 --> 04:44:31.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:44:33.990 --> 04:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
again a reminder that the replacement
 
04:44:34.000 --> 04:44:35.270 align:start position:0%
again a reminder that the replacement

hillsboro 22 which is amherst
 
04:47:52.948 --> 04:47:52.958 align:start position:0%
i'm here to introduce hb 1139 which is a
 
04:47:55.190 --> 04:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
bill that involves consumer empowerment
 
04:47:56.868 --> 04:47:56.878 align:start position:0%
free market competition access to
 
04:48:00.150 --> 04:48:00.160 align:start position:0%

04:48:01.670 --> 04:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
recognizes the reality of living in an
 
04:48:03.750 --> 04:48:03.760 align:start position:0%
increasingly digital world
 
04:48:05.670 --> 04:48:05.680 align:start position:0%
where consumers can
 
04:48:07.830 --> 04:48:07.840 align:start position:0%
shop and retailers can compete on an
 
04:48:09.590 --> 04:48:09.600 align:start position:0%
even playing field
 
04:48:11.590 --> 04:48:11.600 align:start position:0%
i just want to start off saying that
 
04:48:13.510 --> 04:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
our medical professionals including
 
04:48:13.520 --> 04:48:15.030 align:start position:0%
our medical professionals including
optometrists

04:48:15.030 --> 04:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
optometrists
 
04:48:16.788 --> 04:48:16.798 align:start position:0%
are part of a noble profession having
 
04:48:17.830 --> 04:48:17.840 align:start position:0%
said that
 
04:48:19.990 --> 04:48:20.000 align:start position:0%
my wife is a physician so i completely
 
04:48:21.430 --> 04:48:21.440 align:start position:0%
understand that
 
04:48:23.190 --> 04:48:23.200 align:start position:0%
and appreciate that there's a business
 
04:48:25.350 --> 04:48:25.360 align:start position:0%
aspect to every medical practice
 
04:48:27.270 --> 04:48:27.280 align:start position:0%
what we want to be cautious of
 
04:48:29.030 --> 04:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
however is letting the business interest
 
04:48:31.350 --> 04:48:31.360 align:start position:0%
become a detriment to the best interest
 
04:48:32.628 --> 04:48:32.638 align:start position:0%
of the patient interfering with the
 
04:48:35.350 --> 04:48:35.360 align:start position:0%
standard of care for example by unfairly
 
04:48:36.948 --> 04:48:36.958 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily restricting competition
 
04:48:38.868 --> 04:48:38.878 align:start position:0%
for corrective devices like eyeglasses
 
04:48:41.350 --> 04:48:41.360 align:start position:0%
and contact lenses
 
04:48:43.030 --> 04:48:43.040 align:start position:0%
it's understandable
 
04:48:44.550 --> 04:48:44.560 align:start position:0%
that when a business model is under
 
04:48:48.230 --> 04:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
threat that there would be efforts to
 
04:48:50.310 --> 04:48:50.320 align:start position:0%
retain that business model
 
04:48:51.590 --> 04:48:51.600 align:start position:0%
and protect
 
04:48:51.600 --> 04:48:52.390 align:start position:0%
and protect
the

04:48:52.390 --> 04:48:52.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:48:54.550 --> 04:48:54.560 align:start position:0%
interest of the of the practice
 
04:48:54.560 --> 04:48:56.310 align:start position:0%
interest of the of the practice
um

04:48:56.310 --> 04:48:56.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:48:57.990 --> 04:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
before the committee before the hearing
 
04:48:59.830 --> 04:48:59.840 align:start position:0%
i submitted a write-up in support of the
 
04:48:59.840 --> 04:49:00.628 align:start position:0%
i submitted a write-up in support of the
bill

04:49:00.628 --> 04:49:00.638 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:49:02.150 --> 04:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
not going to go over every point because
 
04:49:04.390 --> 04:49:04.400 align:start position:0%
it would take way too long
 
04:49:05.750 --> 04:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
but essentially this bill is about
 
04:49:07.270 --> 04:49:07.280 align:start position:0%
encouraging competition in the retail
 
04:49:09.030 --> 04:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
eyeglass industry while protecting the
 
04:49:11.110 --> 04:49:11.120 align:start position:0%
standard of care for patients it simply
 
04:49:14.070 --> 04:49:14.080 align:start position:0%
fixes a legal anachronism when the laws
 
04:49:14.080 --> 04:49:15.590 align:start position:0%
fixes a legal anachronism when the laws
that

04:49:15.590 --> 04:49:15.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:49:15.600 --> 04:49:16.470 align:start position:0%
that
state

04:49:16.470 --> 04:49:16.480 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:49:18.310 --> 04:49:18.320 align:start position:0%
the parameters required on prescriptions
 
04:49:20.390 --> 04:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
were passed the internet was not yet a
 
04:49:20.400 --> 04:49:22.628 align:start position:0%
were passed the internet was not yet a
thing

04:49:22.628 --> 04:49:22.638 align:start position:0%
thing
 
04:49:24.470 --> 04:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
it could be reasonably assumed that most
 
04:49:25.910 --> 04:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
dispensaries would be in person and
 
04:49:28.390 --> 04:49:28.400 align:start position:0%
there would be somebody there to
 
04:49:31.270 --> 04:49:31.280 align:start position:0%
fit and adjust glasses
 
04:49:35.350 --> 04:49:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:36.628 --> 04:49:36.638 align:start position:0%
this legislation
 
04:49:38.788 --> 04:49:38.798 align:start position:0%
uh corrects specifically the absence of
 
04:49:40.550 --> 04:49:40.560 align:start position:0%
the pupillary distance from
 
04:49:40.560 --> 04:49:41.830 align:start position:0%
the pupillary distance from
prescriptions

04:49:41.830 --> 04:49:41.840 align:start position:0%
prescriptions
 
04:49:43.750 --> 04:49:43.760 align:start position:0%
um pupillary distance is simply the
 
04:49:45.590 --> 04:49:45.600 align:start position:0%
distance between
 
04:49:47.030 --> 04:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
your pupils
 
04:49:49.110 --> 04:49:49.120 align:start position:0%
and there are usually three measurements
 
04:49:50.628 --> 04:49:50.638 align:start position:0%
one is the full distance between the two
 
04:49:51.990 --> 04:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
the two eyes
 
04:49:53.990 --> 04:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
and then the measure from the center
 
04:49:57.030 --> 04:49:57.040 align:start position:0%
line to each eye individually
 
04:49:59.190 --> 04:49:59.200 align:start position:0%
it's usually taken by
 
04:50:00.628 --> 04:50:00.638 align:start position:0%
a device
 
04:50:03.430 --> 04:50:03.440 align:start position:0%
in your optometrist office or optician
 
04:50:05.670 --> 04:50:05.680 align:start position:0%
by called the pupilometer
 
04:50:07.990 --> 04:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
it's a little more accurate than
 
04:50:08.000 --> 04:50:08.868 align:start position:0%
it's a little more accurate than
using

04:50:08.868 --> 04:50:08.878 align:start position:0%
using
 
04:50:10.948 --> 04:50:10.958 align:start position:0%
a ruler but it eventually serves the
 
04:50:13.830 --> 04:50:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:15.430 --> 04:50:15.440 align:start position:0%
this measurement helps
 
04:50:17.030 --> 04:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
place the focal point of the glasses on
 
04:50:18.470 --> 04:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
the right point of the eye so you get
 
04:50:20.390 --> 04:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
maximum benefit from from the corrective
 
04:50:20.400 --> 04:50:21.670 align:start position:0%
maximum benefit from from the corrective
lenses

04:50:21.670 --> 04:50:21.680 align:start position:0%
lenses
 
04:50:23.750 --> 04:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
um i think most of us in this room
 
04:50:25.510 --> 04:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
probably are in the same club
 
04:50:26.628 --> 04:50:26.638 align:start position:0%
either we've been wearing corrective
 
04:50:29.270 --> 04:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
lenses for a long time or at some point
 
04:50:31.590 --> 04:50:31.600 align:start position:0%
as we've gotten older usually our arms
 
04:50:33.510 --> 04:50:33.520 align:start position:0%
stop being long enough to
 
04:50:40.150 --> 04:50:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:41.590 --> 04:50:41.600 align:start position:0%
in most cases we've all found it
 
04:50:43.750 --> 04:50:43.760 align:start position:0%
necessary to at least explore
 
04:50:45.510 --> 04:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
corrective lenses sometimes it meant
 
04:50:47.110 --> 04:50:47.120 align:start position:0%
going to our
 
04:50:49.510 --> 04:50:49.520 align:start position:0%
eye care provider and getting a
 
04:50:51.030 --> 04:50:51.040 align:start position:0%
prescription to
 
04:50:52.708 --> 04:50:52.718 align:start position:0%
take care of whatever our problem was or
 
04:50:54.310 --> 04:50:54.320 align:start position:0%
sometimes it just a trip down to the
 
04:50:56.390 --> 04:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
corner drug store to get a a pair of
 
04:50:56.400 --> 04:50:59.270 align:start position:0%
corner drug store to get a a pair of
readers

04:50:59.270 --> 04:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:01.190 --> 04:51:01.200 align:start position:0%
if you've
 
04:51:01.200 --> 04:51:02.390 align:start position:0%
if you've
shopped

04:51:02.390 --> 04:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
shopped
 
04:51:02.400 --> 04:51:03.430 align:start position:0%
shopped
the

04:51:03.430 --> 04:51:03.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:51:05.590 --> 04:51:05.600 align:start position:0%
offerings at your optometrist office you
 
04:51:06.708 --> 04:51:06.718 align:start position:0%
probably found that the frames are
 
04:51:09.590 --> 04:51:09.600 align:start position:0%
really expensive uh experiences some
 
04:51:11.270 --> 04:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
serious sticker shock
 
04:51:12.310 --> 04:51:12.320 align:start position:0%
if you're wondering why they're so
 
04:51:15.510 --> 04:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
expensive it's because according to
 
04:51:17.830 --> 04:51:17.840 align:start position:0%
a website called ecpu which is eye care
 
04:51:20.310 --> 04:51:20.320 align:start position:0%
provider university who offer advice and
 
04:51:23.590 --> 04:51:23.600 align:start position:0%
do research on behalf of icare providers
 
04:51:25.910 --> 04:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
it's it has to do with the business side
 
04:51:25.920 --> 04:51:28.070 align:start position:0%
it's it has to do with the business side
of

04:51:28.070 --> 04:51:28.080 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:51:30.470 --> 04:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
an optometry
 
04:51:30.480 --> 04:51:33.430 align:start position:0%
an optometry
practice

04:51:33.430 --> 04:51:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:35.590 --> 04:51:35.600 align:start position:0%
practices that specialize in higher end
 
04:51:38.948 --> 04:51:38.958 align:start position:0%
frames and high performance lenses tend
 
04:51:40.310 --> 04:51:40.320 align:start position:0%
to be far more profitable so there's
 
04:51:42.708 --> 04:51:42.718 align:start position:0%
very little incentive to
 
04:51:46.070 --> 04:51:46.080 align:start position:0%
offer generic brands or you know glasses
 
04:51:47.750 --> 04:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
like you can get at that
 
04:51:50.788 --> 04:51:50.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:53.910 --> 04:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:56.550 --> 04:51:56.560 align:start position:0%
in fact up to 90 maybe even more i think
 
04:51:58.150 --> 04:51:58.160 align:start position:0%
that's probably a conservative estimate
 
04:51:58.160 --> 04:51:59.510 align:start position:0%
that's probably a conservative estimate
optometrists

04:51:59.510 --> 04:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
optometrists
 
04:52:02.310 --> 04:52:02.320 align:start position:0%
sell eyeglasses within their office and
 
04:52:04.948 --> 04:52:04.958 align:start position:0%
it can account for 50 or more of their
 
04:52:04.958 --> 04:52:06.708 align:start position:0%
it can account for 50 or more of their
income

04:52:06.708 --> 04:52:06.718 align:start position:0%
income
 
04:52:06.718 --> 04:52:08.868 align:start position:0%
income
um

04:52:08.868 --> 04:52:08.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:52:09.990 --> 04:52:10.000 align:start position:0%
one of the things one of the other
 
04:52:11.350 --> 04:52:11.360 align:start position:0%
things they do is they limit the number
 
04:52:14.070 --> 04:52:14.080 align:start position:0%
of offerings a number of styles
 
04:52:15.830 --> 04:52:15.840 align:start position:0%
um and brands
 
04:52:18.550 --> 04:52:18.560 align:start position:0%
and they try to do things that are uh
 
04:52:20.470 --> 04:52:20.480 align:start position:0%
offer things that aren't not necessarily
 
04:52:23.350 --> 04:52:23.360 align:start position:0%
offered online or in other retailers
 
04:52:26.550 --> 04:52:26.560 align:start position:0%
so they specialize and try to capture
 
04:52:27.990 --> 04:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
our business and it's understandable to
 
04:52:30.070 --> 04:52:30.080 align:start position:0%
do that i think it's acceptable in most
 
04:52:30.080 --> 04:52:31.030 align:start position:0%
do that i think it's acceptable in most
cases

04:52:31.030 --> 04:52:31.040 align:start position:0%
cases
 
04:52:31.040 --> 04:52:31.990 align:start position:0%
cases
um

04:52:31.990 --> 04:52:32.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:52:33.270 --> 04:52:33.280 align:start position:0%
but if you know there are less expensive
 
04:52:35.830 --> 04:52:35.840 align:start position:0%
options online and maybe styles that
 
04:52:38.150 --> 04:52:38.160 align:start position:0%
might suit your taste and
 
04:52:40.230 --> 04:52:40.240 align:start position:0%
and face shape better you may want to
 
04:52:42.230 --> 04:52:42.240 align:start position:0%
explore the options of going online but
 
04:52:43.910 --> 04:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
when you try to order
 
04:52:45.590 --> 04:52:45.600 align:start position:0%
you realize you don't have the pupillary
 
04:52:45.600 --> 04:52:47.670 align:start position:0%
you realize you don't have the pupillary
distance

04:52:47.670 --> 04:52:47.680 align:start position:0%
distance
 
04:52:50.230 --> 04:52:50.240 align:start position:0%
which as as i already explained it's a
 
04:52:51.430 --> 04:52:51.440 align:start position:0%
measurement that they're going to need
 
04:52:53.510 --> 04:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
when they make your glasses
 
04:52:55.030 --> 04:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire if you're an adult and
 
04:52:57.030 --> 04:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
you've had your eyes measured before you
 
04:52:57.910 --> 04:52:57.920 align:start position:0%
probably don't have to have them
 
04:52:59.110 --> 04:52:59.120 align:start position:0%
measured again
 
04:52:59.120 --> 04:53:00.150 align:start position:0%
measured again
and

04:53:00.150 --> 04:53:00.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:53:03.990 --> 04:53:04.000 align:start position:0%

04:53:51.190 --> 04:53:51.200 align:start position:0%
you should have access to it according
 
04:53:52.310 --> 04:53:52.320 align:start position:0%
to the law
 
04:53:53.750 --> 04:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
if they're being denied you've been
 
04:53:56.310 --> 04:53:56.320 align:start position:0%
denied this information
 
04:53:59.990 --> 04:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:02.070 --> 04:54:02.080 align:start position:0%
for children it's really important that
 
04:54:03.670 --> 04:54:03.680 align:start position:0%
their pdb
 
04:54:05.030 --> 04:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
measured regularly because it will
 
04:54:07.110 --> 04:54:07.120 align:start position:0%
change considerably as they grow
 
04:54:10.628 --> 04:54:10.638 align:start position:0%
up until at least age 18.
 
04:54:11.990 --> 04:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
however if the pd is included on the
 
04:54:15.030 --> 04:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
prescription the fdc already requires
 
04:54:16.948 --> 04:54:16.958 align:start position:0%
under the spectacle prescription release
 
04:54:19.110 --> 04:54:19.120 align:start position:0%
rule that the prescription
 
04:54:21.110 --> 04:54:21.120 align:start position:0%
be given to the patient whether or not
 
04:54:25.830 --> 04:54:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:27.190 --> 04:54:27.200 align:start position:0%
i know from personal experience that
 
04:54:31.670 --> 04:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
this does not always happen um
 
04:54:31.680 --> 04:54:33.750 align:start position:0%
this does not always happen um
that

04:54:33.750 --> 04:54:33.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:54:35.510 --> 04:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
the ftc decided to pass this rule
 
04:54:37.430 --> 04:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
because patients were having trouble
 
04:54:38.868 --> 04:54:38.878 align:start position:0%
getting copies of their prescriptions so
 
04:54:40.390 --> 04:54:40.400 align:start position:0%
they could shop around
 
04:54:43.750 --> 04:54:43.760 align:start position:0%
for better prices and better styles
 
04:54:43.760 --> 04:54:47.350 align:start position:0%
for better prices and better styles
um

04:54:47.350 --> 04:54:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:49.110 --> 04:54:49.120 align:start position:0%
so it really troubled me when a
 
04:54:50.868 --> 04:54:50.878 align:start position:0%
constituent contacted me about a problem
 
04:54:53.190 --> 04:54:53.200 align:start position:0%
they had trying to get their son's pd
 
04:54:53.200 --> 04:54:54.230 align:start position:0%
they had trying to get their son's pd
um

04:54:54.230 --> 04:54:54.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:54:55.430 --> 04:54:55.440 align:start position:0%
i don't know if they were violating the
 
04:54:56.550 --> 04:54:56.560 align:start position:0%
state law or if they give out an
 
04:54:58.230 --> 04:54:58.240 align:start position:0%
existing pd or the optometrist or
 
04:55:00.628 --> 04:55:00.638 align:start position:0%
optician we're just
 
04:55:03.110 --> 04:55:03.120 align:start position:0%
refusing to do it for whatever whatever
 
04:55:04.550 --> 04:55:04.560 align:start position:0%
their their personal reasons were i
 
04:55:05.750 --> 04:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
don't understand
 
04:55:06.948 --> 04:55:06.958 align:start position:0%
but um
 
04:55:08.628 --> 04:55:08.638 align:start position:0%
it seems like uh
 
04:55:09.830 --> 04:55:09.840 align:start position:0%
the main
 
04:55:13.190 --> 04:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
reason to to withhold it would be to
 
04:55:15.510 --> 04:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
just as a protectionist
 
04:55:17.030 --> 04:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
practice to try to keep the business
 
04:55:18.550 --> 04:55:18.560 align:start position:0%
within house
 
04:55:22.470 --> 04:55:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:25.510 --> 04:55:25.520 align:start position:0%
problematic to give the pd than it is to
 
04:55:26.948 --> 04:55:26.958 align:start position:0%
provide the other parameters like
 
04:55:28.550 --> 04:55:28.560 align:start position:0%
refractive power access cylinder and
 
04:55:30.550 --> 04:55:30.560 align:start position:0%
prism which are all required by law to
 
04:55:33.510 --> 04:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:35.750 --> 04:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
i know
 
04:55:35.760 --> 04:55:36.868 align:start position:0%
i know
when

04:55:36.868 --> 04:55:36.878 align:start position:0%
when
 
04:55:38.150 --> 04:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
when i had to buy glasses for my
 
04:55:40.470 --> 04:55:40.480 align:start position:0%
four-year-old daughter
 
04:55:42.390 --> 04:55:42.400 align:start position:0%
my wife and i discussed what we were
 
04:55:43.750 --> 04:55:43.760 align:start position:0%
going to do because the cheapest glasses
 
04:55:45.910 --> 04:55:45.920 align:start position:0%
we could find in our optometry office
 
04:55:45.920 --> 04:55:47.590 align:start position:0%
we could find in our optometry office
was

04:55:47.590 --> 04:55:47.600 align:start position:0%
was
 
04:55:49.830 --> 04:55:49.840 align:start position:0%
300 to 350 and that didn't include the
 
04:55:49.840 --> 04:55:51.510 align:start position:0%
300 to 350 and that didn't include the
lenses

04:55:51.510 --> 04:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
lenses
 
04:55:51.520 --> 04:55:52.390 align:start position:0%
lenses
so

04:55:52.390 --> 04:55:52.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:55:53.830 --> 04:55:53.840 align:start position:0%
so we decided you know well we don't
 
04:55:54.868 --> 04:55:54.878 align:start position:0%
know anything about glasses we don't
 
04:55:56.788 --> 04:55:56.798 align:start position:0%
know if they're going to be you know we
 
04:55:58.788 --> 04:55:58.798 align:start position:0%
heard about zenni optical which was just
 
04:56:00.070 --> 04:56:00.080 align:start position:0%
starting out at the time this was about
 
04:56:01.270 --> 04:56:01.280 align:start position:0%
10 years ago
 
04:56:03.430 --> 04:56:03.440 align:start position:0%
so we we said well let's get
 
04:56:05.510 --> 04:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
a primary pair from from the optometry
 
04:56:07.830 --> 04:56:07.840 align:start position:0%
office and then we'll go to zenni and
 
04:56:09.030 --> 04:56:09.040 align:start position:0%
we'll get some backups because we know
 
04:56:10.470 --> 04:56:10.480 align:start position:0%
there's margin of error kids always wear
 
04:56:11.510 --> 04:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
you know they break glasses and they
 
04:56:12.948 --> 04:56:12.958 align:start position:0%
have to wear an old pair that was an old
 
04:56:14.628 --> 04:56:14.638 align:start position:0%
prescription it's not going to hurt them
 
04:56:16.550 --> 04:56:16.560 align:start position:0%
if they have to go a few days or
 
04:56:18.310 --> 04:56:18.320 align:start position:0%
whatever and so my daughter got to play
 
04:56:19.430 --> 04:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
on the playground with with these
 
04:56:21.030 --> 04:56:21.040 align:start position:0%
glasses and and for the most part they
 
04:56:23.670 --> 04:56:23.680 align:start position:0%
were good quality they lasted um she
 
04:56:25.430 --> 04:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
beat the heck out of them and and you
 
04:56:27.030 --> 04:56:27.040 align:start position:0%
know they kept on ticking
 
04:56:27.040 --> 04:56:27.910 align:start position:0%
know they kept on ticking
so

04:56:27.910 --> 04:56:27.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:56:27.920 --> 04:56:28.788 align:start position:0%
so
um

04:56:28.788 --> 04:56:28.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:56:30.948 --> 04:56:30.958 align:start position:0%
we were very supportive of it but when i
 
04:56:33.030 --> 04:56:33.040 align:start position:0%
went online to buy them i realized i
 
04:56:34.390 --> 04:56:34.400 align:start position:0%
didn't have the pd
 
04:56:36.390 --> 04:56:36.400 align:start position:0%
but i was
 
04:56:37.910 --> 04:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
you know aware enough to read the
 
04:56:40.230 --> 04:56:40.240 align:start position:0%
directions and i had a ruler and you
 
04:56:41.430 --> 04:56:41.440 align:start position:0%
know trying to get a four-year-old to
 
04:56:43.190 --> 04:56:43.200 align:start position:0%
sit still long enough to measure it you
 
04:56:44.868 --> 04:56:44.878 align:start position:0%
know and i got something i hope was
 
04:56:44.878 --> 04:56:45.910 align:start position:0%
know and i got something i hope was
reasonable

04:56:45.910 --> 04:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
04:56:45.920 --> 04:56:47.350 align:start position:0%
reasonable
um

04:56:47.350 --> 04:56:47.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:56:47.360 --> 04:56:48.868 align:start position:0%
um
so

04:56:48.868 --> 04:56:48.878 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:56:48.878 --> 04:56:49.670 align:start position:0%
so
um

04:56:49.670 --> 04:56:49.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:56:51.110 --> 04:56:51.120 align:start position:0%
it just
 
04:56:53.190 --> 04:56:53.200 align:start position:0%
when i started hearing about
 
04:56:55.430 --> 04:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
you know optometrists and opticians
 
04:56:57.830 --> 04:56:57.840 align:start position:0%
refusing to to give out the
 
04:56:59.830 --> 04:56:59.840 align:start position:0%
the pd it just didn't make sense because
 
04:57:02.070 --> 04:57:02.080 align:start position:0%
you know one of the arguments is that oh
 
04:57:07.030 --> 04:57:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:08.708 --> 04:57:08.718 align:start position:0%
it's the optician's job
 
04:57:10.788 --> 04:57:10.798 align:start position:0%
well the optician in 90 of the cases or
 
04:57:13.590 --> 04:57:13.600 align:start position:0%
more works for the optometrist so why
 
04:57:15.190 --> 04:57:15.200 align:start position:0%
can't the optician measure it just like
 
04:57:16.708 --> 04:57:16.718 align:start position:0%
a nurse would measure the blood pressure
 
04:57:18.788 --> 04:57:18.798 align:start position:0%
you know if the optometrist isn't
 
04:57:21.030 --> 04:57:21.040 align:start position:0%
comfortable measuring it you know
 
04:57:22.470 --> 04:57:22.480 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter who measures it the
 
04:57:22.480 --> 04:57:23.190 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter who measures it the
law

04:57:23.190 --> 04:57:23.200 align:start position:0%
law
 
04:57:25.030 --> 04:57:25.040 align:start position:0%
is written in such a way that anybody
 
04:57:27.670 --> 04:57:27.680 align:start position:0%
any trained optician can can revise that
 
04:57:29.270 --> 04:57:29.280 align:start position:0%
particular parameter not the others but
 
04:57:33.510 --> 04:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
that one um and then i started thinking
 
04:57:33.520 --> 04:57:35.670 align:start position:0%
that one um and then i started thinking
um

04:57:35.670 --> 04:57:35.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:57:35.680 --> 04:57:36.708 align:start position:0%
um
about

04:57:36.708 --> 04:57:36.718 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:57:39.270 --> 04:57:39.280 align:start position:0%
things like uh the safety risk you know
 
04:57:40.788 --> 04:57:40.798 align:start position:0%
you know one of our concerns when we got
 
04:57:42.708 --> 04:57:42.718 align:start position:0%
our daughter's glasses was
 
04:57:44.070 --> 04:57:44.080 align:start position:0%
when we're going to hurt our eyes and
 
04:57:45.670 --> 04:57:45.680 align:start position:0%
that's just not the case and in most
 
04:57:47.990 --> 04:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
cases like i said there's there's quite
 
04:57:48.000 --> 04:57:48.628 align:start position:0%
cases like i said there's there's quite
a

04:57:48.628 --> 04:57:48.638 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:57:51.510 --> 04:57:51.520 align:start position:0%
a range of of limit before it even
 
04:57:52.868 --> 04:57:52.878 align:start position:0%
becomes uncomfortable let alone doing
 
04:57:56.310 --> 04:57:56.320 align:start position:0%
damage in fact um
 
04:57:58.070 --> 04:57:58.080 align:start position:0%
the province of british columbia and
 
04:58:01.510 --> 04:58:01.520 align:start position:0%
canada has completely deregulated
 
04:58:01.520 --> 04:58:02.628 align:start position:0%
canada has completely deregulated
eyeglass

04:58:02.628 --> 04:58:02.638 align:start position:0%
eyeglass
 
04:58:03.670 --> 04:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
prescriptions you don't need a
 
04:58:05.190 --> 04:58:05.200 align:start position:0%
prescription you don't even need a prior
 
04:58:05.200 --> 04:58:06.550 align:start position:0%
prescription you don't even need a prior
exam

04:58:06.550 --> 04:58:06.560 align:start position:0%
exam
 
04:58:07.910 --> 04:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
they've they've
 
04:58:11.110 --> 04:58:11.120 align:start position:0%
they did that in 2010 and it was
 
04:58:12.390 --> 04:58:12.400 align:start position:0%
predicted that there would be a lot of
 
04:58:13.750 --> 04:58:13.760 align:start position:0%
pushback later on because there'll be
 
04:58:16.230 --> 04:58:16.240 align:start position:0%
all kinds of eye damage and problems and
 
04:58:17.750 --> 04:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
people would really want the law put
 
04:58:19.430 --> 04:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
back the way it was and that hasn't
 
04:58:19.440 --> 04:58:20.470 align:start position:0%
back the way it was and that hasn't
happened

04:58:20.470 --> 04:58:20.480 align:start position:0%
happened
 
04:58:22.708 --> 04:58:22.718 align:start position:0%
um but i do want to put in a little
 
04:58:25.590 --> 04:58:25.600 align:start position:0%
disclaimer that you know here
 
04:58:26.868 --> 04:58:26.878 align:start position:0%
having said that
 
04:58:28.550 --> 04:58:28.560 align:start position:0%
you know british columbia is deregulated
 
04:58:29.590 --> 04:58:29.600 align:start position:0%
i want to make sure that everybody
 
04:58:31.190 --> 04:58:31.200 align:start position:0%
understands that it's important to see
 
04:58:33.270 --> 04:58:33.280 align:start position:0%
your eye care professional they can
 
04:58:35.270 --> 04:58:35.280 align:start position:0%
recognize diseases and other problems
 
04:58:36.948 --> 04:58:36.958 align:start position:0%
that may not have to do with the eyes
 
04:58:38.708 --> 04:58:38.718 align:start position:0%
that are affecting your vision uh way
 
04:58:40.150 --> 04:58:40.160 align:start position:0%
ahead of time and it's important if
 
04:58:41.590 --> 04:58:41.600 align:start position:0%
you're having vision problems to go
 
04:58:43.190 --> 04:58:43.200 align:start position:0%
ahead and
 
04:58:45.270 --> 04:58:45.280 align:start position:0%
see an eye care professional
 
04:58:46.470 --> 04:58:46.480 align:start position:0%
that we don't want to take away or
 
04:58:50.788 --> 04:58:50.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:52.948 --> 04:58:52.958 align:start position:0%
but if a patient wants to
 
04:58:54.230 --> 04:58:54.240 align:start position:0%
you know obviously
 
04:58:54.240 --> 04:58:54.830 align:start position:0%
you know obviously
i

04:58:54.830 --> 04:58:54.840 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:58:57.750 --> 04:58:57.760 align:start position:0%
think it it goes with that argument that
 
04:59:00.470 --> 04:59:00.480 align:start position:0%
a real optician a licensed professional
 
04:59:01.910 --> 04:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
is going to fit the glasses properly
 
04:59:02.948 --> 04:59:02.958 align:start position:0%
they're going to they're going to fit
 
04:59:04.230 --> 04:59:04.240 align:start position:0%
right on your face they're going to look
 
04:59:05.350 --> 04:59:05.360 align:start position:0%
right they can be comfortable they're
 
04:59:07.510 --> 04:59:07.520 align:start position:0%
not going to slide down your nose
 
04:59:09.910 --> 04:59:09.920 align:start position:0%
but if if a patient wants to forego that
 
04:59:11.590 --> 04:59:11.600 align:start position:0%
part of the process and they're willing
 
04:59:13.350 --> 04:59:13.360 align:start position:0%
to put up with a little margin of error
 
04:59:15.830 --> 04:59:15.840 align:start position:0%
that's really a consumer choice
 
04:59:17.110 --> 04:59:17.120 align:start position:0%
it should matter to no more to the
 
04:59:20.070 --> 04:59:20.080 align:start position:0%
physician or i mean the ikf professional
 
04:59:21.030 --> 04:59:21.040 align:start position:0%
whether it's an optician or an
 
04:59:21.040 --> 04:59:22.310 align:start position:0%
whether it's an optician or an
ophthalmologist

04:59:22.310 --> 04:59:22.320 align:start position:0%
ophthalmologist
 
04:59:24.708 --> 04:59:24.718 align:start position:0%
where a patient gets their glasses
 
04:59:26.390 --> 04:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
any more than it matters where what
 
04:59:28.150 --> 04:59:28.160 align:start position:0%
pharmacy a patient uses to fill their
 
04:59:29.910 --> 04:59:29.920 align:start position:0%
their medical prescription or whether
 
04:59:31.270 --> 04:59:31.280 align:start position:0%
they choose a brand name drug or a
 
04:59:31.280 --> 04:59:32.310 align:start position:0%
they choose a brand name drug or a
generic

04:59:32.310 --> 04:59:32.320 align:start position:0%
generic
 
04:59:32.320 --> 04:59:34.310 align:start position:0%
generic
um

04:59:34.310 --> 04:59:34.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:59:35.670 --> 04:59:35.680 align:start position:0%
in the 10 years since my daughter got
 
04:59:38.470 --> 04:59:38.480 align:start position:0%
her first set of glasses online a lot of
 
04:59:39.910 --> 04:59:39.920 align:start position:0%
other companies have cropped up and they
 
04:59:41.670 --> 04:59:41.680 align:start position:0%
do offer
 
04:59:44.230 --> 04:59:44.240 align:start position:0%
pretty hefty and respectable warranty
 
04:59:46.550 --> 04:59:46.560 align:start position:0%
policies and satisfaction
 
04:59:47.990 --> 04:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
policies that allow you to return the
 
04:59:49.430 --> 04:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
glasses and maybe even try on several
 
04:59:54.310 --> 04:59:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:56.470 --> 04:59:56.480 align:start position:0%
it also has to do with
 
04:59:57.830 --> 04:59:57.840 align:start position:0%
not only our
 
05:00:00.070 --> 05:00:00.080 align:start position:0%
eyewear retailers
 
05:00:01.990 --> 05:00:02.000 align:start position:0%
pressuring patients to
 
05:00:04.470 --> 05:00:04.480 align:start position:0%
stay in-house but also
 
05:00:06.390 --> 05:00:06.400 align:start position:0%
there's i don't know anybody's heard of
 
05:00:08.390 --> 05:00:08.400 align:start position:0%
the company called luxottica
 
05:00:10.390 --> 05:00:10.400 align:start position:0%
they own about 40 of the nation's
 
05:00:13.350 --> 05:00:13.360 align:start position:0%
retailers including lens crafters and
 
05:00:15.590 --> 05:00:15.600 align:start position:0%
pearl vision and target vision
 
05:00:17.590 --> 05:00:17.600 align:start position:0%
and they control about 40 of the actual
 
05:00:19.270 --> 05:00:19.280 align:start position:0%
retail market
 
05:00:21.110 --> 05:00:21.120 align:start position:0%
and in addition they also are the top
 
05:00:23.030 --> 05:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
manufacturer of almost every
 
05:00:25.750 --> 05:00:25.760 align:start position:0%
designer brand of glasses made so
 
05:00:28.788 --> 05:00:28.798 align:start position:0%
whether you go to your own optician or
 
05:00:30.868 --> 05:00:30.878 align:start position:0%
to a third party chances are unless
 
05:00:32.788 --> 05:00:32.798 align:start position:0%
you're chopping from like zeni or warby
 
05:00:34.470 --> 05:00:34.480 align:start position:0%
or any of the others that have their own
 
05:00:37.030 --> 05:00:37.040 align:start position:0%
proprietary designs and they make their
 
05:00:39.110 --> 05:00:39.120 align:start position:0%
own you're buying from lux auto and
 
05:00:40.708 --> 05:00:40.718 align:start position:0%
they're they're propping up the prices
 
05:00:42.948 --> 05:00:42.958 align:start position:0%
as well they're they're a very big
 
05:00:46.788 --> 05:00:46.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:48.948 --> 05:00:48.958 align:start position:0%
one of the things that i want to make
 
05:00:50.948 --> 05:00:50.958 align:start position:0%
sure is
 
05:00:53.430 --> 05:00:53.440 align:start position:0%
that this is about deregulation this is
 
05:00:55.750 --> 05:00:55.760 align:start position:0%
giving the consumer the choice to to go
 
05:00:57.590 --> 05:00:57.600 align:start position:0%
off uh it's not the full kind of
 
05:00:59.510 --> 05:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
deregulation like british columbia but
 
05:01:01.430 --> 05:01:01.440 align:start position:0%
it gives customers a little more of a
 
05:01:01.440 --> 05:01:02.390 align:start position:0%
it gives customers a little more of a
choice

05:01:02.390 --> 05:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
choice
 
05:01:04.550 --> 05:01:04.560 align:start position:0%
um give them a little more freedom by
 
05:01:06.310 --> 05:01:06.320 align:start position:0%
putting this on the on the prescription
 
05:01:07.750 --> 05:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
there are other parameters that could go
 
05:01:08.948 --> 05:01:08.958 align:start position:0%
on a prescription as well if you have
 
05:01:11.270 --> 05:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
bifocals if you have trifocals
 
05:01:12.868 --> 05:01:12.878 align:start position:0%
yeah there are probably other things but
 
05:01:15.270 --> 05:01:15.280 align:start position:0%
this is this is a pretty benign
 
05:01:16.788 --> 05:01:16.798 align:start position:0%
measurement and it's not going to do any
 
05:01:18.150 --> 05:01:18.160 align:start position:0%
damage to you or
 
05:01:19.830 --> 05:01:19.840 align:start position:0%
your children if it's off by a little
 
05:01:19.840 --> 05:01:21.910 align:start position:0%
your children if it's off by a little
bit

05:01:21.910 --> 05:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
bit
 
05:01:25.110 --> 05:01:25.120 align:start position:0%
you know even even your optometrist and
 
05:01:25.120 --> 05:01:26.230 align:start position:0%
you know even even your optometrist and
optician

05:01:26.230 --> 05:01:26.240 align:start position:0%
optician
 
05:01:28.470 --> 05:01:28.480 align:start position:0%
they're going to make mistakes too
 
05:01:30.230 --> 05:01:30.240 align:start position:0%
one of the arguments that i've heard is
 
05:01:32.708 --> 05:01:32.718 align:start position:0%
that online companies make a large
 
05:01:33.990 --> 05:01:34.000 align:start position:0%
number of errors but what they don't do
 
05:01:35.350 --> 05:01:35.360 align:start position:0%
is compare it to the number of errors
 
05:01:36.628 --> 05:01:36.638 align:start position:0%
that actually
 
05:01:39.510 --> 05:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
happen with in-person services as well
 
05:01:41.030 --> 05:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
we're all they're all human and they all
 
05:01:42.550 --> 05:01:42.560 align:start position:0%
make mistakes whether it's the optician
 
05:01:44.310 --> 05:01:44.320 align:start position:0%
the optometrist or the technician who
 
05:01:45.990 --> 05:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
actually builds your glasses they all
 
05:01:47.750 --> 05:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
make mistakes and
 
05:01:49.830 --> 05:01:49.840 align:start position:0%
you know maybe the errors are higher on
 
05:01:51.110 --> 05:01:51.120 align:start position:0%
online but
 
05:01:52.628 --> 05:01:52.638 align:start position:0%
that's the consumer's choice
 
05:01:53.990 --> 05:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
representative i'm going to ask you to
 
05:01:55.590 --> 05:01:55.600 align:start position:0%
bring it to a close we've got some other
 
05:01:57.910 --> 05:01:57.920 align:start position:0%
people who are going to testify okay um
 
05:02:00.470 --> 05:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
i do have a quick statement warby parker
 
05:02:02.390 --> 05:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
their government affairs rep wanted to
 
05:02:04.628 --> 05:02:04.638 align:start position:0%
be here today but he has coveted and
 
05:02:06.070 --> 05:02:06.080 align:start position:0%
decided not to come
 
05:02:07.990 --> 05:02:08.000 align:start position:0%
uh if i can i'll read a quick statement
 
05:02:10.070 --> 05:02:10.080 align:start position:0%
from him i know he submitted
 
05:02:11.910 --> 05:02:11.920 align:start position:0%
written testimony as well it says warrie
 
05:02:13.350 --> 05:02:13.360 align:start position:0%
parker an online brick and mortar
 
05:02:14.868 --> 05:02:14.878 align:start position:0%
glasses retailer supports house bill
 
05:02:16.788 --> 05:02:16.798 align:start position:0%
1139 because it tries to strike the
 
05:02:19.190 --> 05:02:19.200 align:start position:0%
right balance between empowering
 
05:02:21.270 --> 05:02:21.280 align:start position:0%
patients to have choices in where they
 
05:02:22.788 --> 05:02:22.798 align:start position:0%
purchase glasses while ensuring the
 
05:02:22.798 --> 05:02:23.990 align:start position:0%
purchase glasses while ensuring the
opticians

05:02:23.990 --> 05:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
opticians
 
05:02:25.350 --> 05:02:25.360 align:start position:0%
in retail stores can still make
 
05:02:26.948 --> 05:02:26.958 align:start position:0%
adjustments to interpupillary distance
 
05:02:29.270 --> 05:02:29.280 align:start position:0%
as necessary to best serve the patients
 
05:02:31.190 --> 05:02:31.200 align:start position:0%
the balance makes
 
05:02:32.868 --> 05:02:32.878 align:start position:0%
for good public policy and warby parker
 
05:02:34.550 --> 05:02:34.560 align:start position:0%
requests a favorable report from the
 
05:02:34.560 --> 05:02:36.150 align:start position:0%
requests a favorable report from the
committee

05:02:36.150 --> 05:02:36.160 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:02:38.628 --> 05:02:38.638 align:start position:0%
i also have an amendment that corrects a
 
05:02:40.070 --> 05:02:40.080 align:start position:0%
typographical area there were a couple
 
05:02:41.830 --> 05:02:41.840 align:start position:0%
of commas that were omitted that make a
 
05:02:42.948 --> 05:02:42.958 align:start position:0%
difference in the
 
05:02:45.270 --> 05:02:45.280 align:start position:0%
handout you wish to send around i don't
 
05:02:48.550 --> 05:02:48.560 align:start position:0%
i i submitted the the written testimony
 
05:02:50.150 --> 05:02:50.160 align:start position:0%
online okay that's cool and it was
 
05:02:51.270 --> 05:02:51.280 align:start position:0%

thank you any questions for the

and i also proudly serve as the
 
05:03:29.670 --> 05:03:29.680 align:start position:0%
president of the new hampshire society
 
05:03:32.788 --> 05:03:32.798 align:start position:0%
of eye physicians and surgeons thank you
 
05:03:34.150 --> 05:03:34.160 align:start position:0%
mr chairman and the remainder of the
 
05:03:36.230 --> 05:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
community committee for uh listening to
 
05:03:37.830 --> 05:03:37.840 align:start position:0%
what i hope will be concise as i know
 
05:03:40.390 --> 05:03:40.400 align:start position:0%
we're running a bit behind schedule but
 
05:03:42.070 --> 05:03:42.080 align:start position:0%
i i wanted to
 
05:03:42.080 --> 05:03:43.110 align:start position:0%
i i wanted to
um

05:03:43.110 --> 05:03:43.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:03:46.310 --> 05:03:46.320 align:start position:0%
i completely agree with the
 
05:03:50.070 --> 05:03:50.080 align:start position:0%
uh motivation for this bill to allow for
 
05:03:52.150 --> 05:03:52.160 align:start position:0%
free market and to allow for competition
 
05:03:54.470 --> 05:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
in the retail eyewear space
 
05:03:56.868 --> 05:03:56.878 align:start position:0%
the concern that i have is that it will
 
05:03:58.708 --> 05:03:58.718 align:start position:0%
be at the detriment of patient care i
 
05:04:00.470 --> 05:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
strongly believe and the reason for that
 
05:04:01.990 --> 05:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
is because
 
05:04:04.070 --> 05:04:04.080 align:start position:0%
the pupillary distance is not a
 
05:04:06.150 --> 05:04:06.160 align:start position:0%
measurement that we take as eye care
 
05:04:08.070 --> 05:04:08.080 align:start position:0%
providers at the time a glass of script
 
05:04:09.190 --> 05:04:09.200 align:start position:0%
is written
 
05:04:11.830 --> 05:04:11.840 align:start position:0%
because it is not sufficient to
 
05:04:13.830 --> 05:04:13.840 align:start position:0%
translate into a satisfactory pair of
 
05:04:15.990 --> 05:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
glasses for most patients and by
 
05:04:17.590 --> 05:04:17.600 align:start position:0%
including that measurement on there it
 
05:04:19.270 --> 05:04:19.280 align:start position:0%
would imply that all you need is the
 
05:04:21.110 --> 05:04:21.120 align:start position:0%
power of the glasses and the pupillary
 
05:04:23.030 --> 05:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
distance and you should be fine
 
05:04:25.030 --> 05:04:25.040 align:start position:0%
it is not as if we take this measurement
 
05:04:26.470 --> 05:04:26.480 align:start position:0%
and we withhold it from the patient
 
05:04:28.550 --> 05:04:28.560 align:start position:0%
because we want the patient to
 
05:04:30.310 --> 05:04:30.320 align:start position:0%
have their glasses purchased from a
 
05:04:32.948 --> 05:04:32.958 align:start position:0%
specific place it is simply because
 
05:04:35.030 --> 05:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
there's more to a satisfactory pair of
 
05:04:37.190 --> 05:04:37.200 align:start position:0%
glasses than just the distance between
 
05:04:38.948 --> 05:04:38.958 align:start position:0%
the pupils
 
05:04:41.430 --> 05:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
the the way frames sit on the face they
 
05:04:42.948 --> 05:04:42.958 align:start position:0%
might be a little bit higher and folks
 
05:04:44.708 --> 05:04:44.718 align:start position:0%
with a prominent nasal bridge like
 
05:04:47.270 --> 05:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
myself they might be lower and folks
 
05:04:49.990 --> 05:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
with a more eloquent shaped nose than me
 
05:04:51.910 --> 05:04:51.920 align:start position:0%
they might come a little lower and the
 
05:04:54.230 --> 05:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
where the pupils are vertically is very
 
05:04:56.150 --> 05:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
important all of our ears are in
 
05:04:58.070 --> 05:04:58.080 align:start position:0%
slightly different places so the tilt of
 
05:04:59.830 --> 05:04:59.840 align:start position:0%
the lenses is important the distance
 
05:05:02.230 --> 05:05:02.240 align:start position:0%
from the surface of the eye to the lens
 
05:05:04.070 --> 05:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
is also important and the pupillary
 
05:05:06.230 --> 05:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
distance does not account for these
 
05:05:06.240 --> 05:05:07.670 align:start position:0%
distance does not account for these
subtleties

05:05:07.670 --> 05:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
subtleties
 
05:05:07.680 --> 05:05:09.350 align:start position:0%
subtleties
by

05:05:09.350 --> 05:05:09.360 align:start position:0%
by
 
05:05:11.830 --> 05:05:11.840 align:start position:0%
having just the pupillary distance used
 
05:05:14.390 --> 05:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
to fit glasses to a patient's face it is
 
05:05:16.628 --> 05:05:16.638 align:start position:0%
cutting a lot of corners and i agree
 
05:05:19.430 --> 05:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
that if patients want to
 
05:05:22.708 --> 05:05:22.718 align:start position:0%
accept that small amount of error that
 
05:05:25.110 --> 05:05:25.120 align:start position:0%
representative value mentioned that is
 
05:05:27.990 --> 05:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
that is okay but the problem is if it is
 
05:05:29.990 --> 05:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
on the prescription even with the most
 
05:05:30.000 --> 05:05:31.270 align:start position:0%
on the prescription even with the most
perfect

05:05:31.270 --> 05:05:31.280 align:start position:0%
perfect
 
05:05:33.110 --> 05:05:33.120 align:start position:0%
pupillary distance measurement the
 
05:05:34.628 --> 05:05:34.638 align:start position:0%
patient is at a high likelihood of
 
05:05:37.030 --> 05:05:37.040 align:start position:0%
disliking their glasses and immediately
 
05:05:38.550 --> 05:05:38.560 align:start position:0%
assuming that the prescription is
 
05:05:38.560 --> 05:05:39.670 align:start position:0%
assuming that the prescription is
incorrect

05:05:39.670 --> 05:05:39.680 align:start position:0%
incorrect
 
05:05:39.680 --> 05:05:40.470 align:start position:0%
incorrect
and

05:05:40.470 --> 05:05:40.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:05:42.310 --> 05:05:42.320 align:start position:0%
as healthcare providers whether we're
 
05:05:43.910 --> 05:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
eye providers ophthalmologists
 
05:05:45.670 --> 05:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
optometrists whatever we are
 
05:05:48.230 --> 05:05:48.240 align:start position:0%
our goal is to constantly try to improve
 
05:05:50.070 --> 05:05:50.080 align:start position:0%
patient care improve patient outcomes
 
05:05:52.310 --> 05:05:52.320 align:start position:0%
result in uh delivering better patient
 
05:05:53.510 --> 05:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
care and i think that this would
 
05:05:55.590 --> 05:05:55.600 align:start position:0%
unfortunately be a step in the wrong
 
05:05:55.600 --> 05:05:56.948 align:start position:0%
unfortunately be a step in the wrong
direction

05:05:56.948 --> 05:05:56.958 align:start position:0%
direction
 
05:05:58.390 --> 05:05:58.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:06:00.948 --> 05:06:00.958 align:start position:0%
i'd like to ask a question my
 
05:06:02.628 --> 05:06:02.638 align:start position:0%
eye care professional is in
 
05:06:02.638 --> 05:06:04.390 align:start position:0%
eye care professional is in
massachusetts

05:06:04.390 --> 05:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
massachusetts
 
05:06:08.070 --> 05:06:08.080 align:start position:0%
and he has an office right next to his
 
05:06:09.670 --> 05:06:09.680 align:start position:0%
that sells
 
05:06:12.550 --> 05:06:12.560 align:start position:0%
glasses and he owns that facility and so
 
05:06:14.150 --> 05:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
i asked him one day
 
05:06:16.628 --> 05:06:16.638 align:start position:0%
obviously it is an advantage for me to
 
05:06:18.948 --> 05:06:18.958 align:start position:0%
take about five steps over there to get
 
05:06:20.310 --> 05:06:20.320 align:start position:0%
my glasses
 
05:06:22.948 --> 05:06:22.958 align:start position:0%
but if i chose to go to a company
 
05:06:25.510 --> 05:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
elsewhere in town
 
05:06:28.150 --> 05:06:28.160 align:start position:0%
and the person
 
05:06:29.990 --> 05:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
service serving me
 
05:06:31.590 --> 05:06:31.600 align:start position:0%
had a question
 
05:06:33.750 --> 05:06:33.760 align:start position:0%
to make sure that it was done exactly
 
05:06:33.760 --> 05:06:34.868 align:start position:0%
to make sure that it was done exactly
right

05:06:34.868 --> 05:06:34.878 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:06:37.350 --> 05:06:37.360 align:start position:0%
just as his person five steps away would
 
05:06:37.360 --> 05:06:38.788 align:start position:0%
just as his person five steps away would
ask

05:06:38.788 --> 05:06:38.798 align:start position:0%
ask
 
05:06:40.708 --> 05:06:40.718 align:start position:0%
would that be okay
 
05:06:42.550 --> 05:06:42.560 align:start position:0%
and he said yes it would i would answer
 
05:06:44.868 --> 05:06:44.878 align:start position:0%
their questions from another store just
 
05:06:49.110 --> 05:06:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:51.350 --> 05:06:51.360 align:start position:0%
i have heard that some people have not
 
05:06:53.670 --> 05:06:53.680 align:start position:0%
been given such a gracious answer as my
 
05:06:55.270 --> 05:06:55.280 align:start position:0%
guy gave to me
 
05:06:55.280 --> 05:06:56.230 align:start position:0%
guy gave to me
and

05:06:56.230 --> 05:06:56.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:07:00.390 --> 05:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
this is trying to become a question um
 
05:07:02.390 --> 05:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
how would you respond to that
 
05:07:04.390 --> 05:07:04.400 align:start position:0%
yeah you know i can only speak
 
05:07:06.310 --> 05:07:06.320 align:start position:0%
personally rather than the specific
 
05:07:09.030 --> 05:07:09.040 align:start position:0%
circumstances but we have patients all
 
05:07:10.708 --> 05:07:10.718 align:start position:0%
the time you know where i write a
 
05:07:12.310 --> 05:07:12.320 align:start position:0%
prescription and they're dissatisfied
 
05:07:14.230 --> 05:07:14.240 align:start position:0%
with their glasses and they typically
 
05:07:15.910 --> 05:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
what happens is they call the office and
 
05:07:18.390 --> 05:07:18.400 align:start position:0%
the first thing that we do is they
 
05:07:19.990 --> 05:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
confirm that the script written makes
 
05:07:21.670 --> 05:07:21.680 align:start position:0%
sense based on the medical chart that's
 
05:07:23.750 --> 05:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
available and if that's the case we have
 
05:07:25.430 --> 05:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
the patient come in for a no-charge
 
05:07:27.350 --> 05:07:27.360 align:start position:0%
visit regardless of where they got
 
05:07:28.868 --> 05:07:28.878 align:start position:0%
received the glasses
 
05:07:30.868 --> 05:07:30.878 align:start position:0%
and it's a no-charge visit and we make
 
05:07:32.788 --> 05:07:32.798 align:start position:0%
sure the script that was written matches
 
05:07:34.948 --> 05:07:34.958 align:start position:0%
up with what's in the lenses and then we
 
05:07:36.628 --> 05:07:36.638 align:start position:0%
check for these other things you know if
 
05:07:38.628 --> 05:07:38.638 align:start position:0%
the center of the lens is where we
 
05:07:41.030 --> 05:07:41.040 align:start position:0%
expect it to be if the tilt is properly
 
05:07:42.788 --> 05:07:42.798 align:start position:0%
accounting for the patient's astigmatism
 
05:07:45.030 --> 05:07:45.040 align:start position:0%
and all these kind of optical things
 
05:07:47.830 --> 05:07:47.840 align:start position:0%
that is going to bore you to death but
 
05:07:50.708 --> 05:07:50.718 align:start position:0%
we we do do a good job of making sure
 
05:07:53.190 --> 05:07:53.200 align:start position:0%
that the script that was written matches
 
05:07:56.070 --> 05:07:56.080 align:start position:0%
the lenses perfectly i i can just say
 
05:07:58.150 --> 05:07:58.160 align:start position:0%
that you know we are
 
05:07:59.830 --> 05:07:59.840 align:start position:0%
we're community ophthalmologists we're
 
05:08:02.150 --> 05:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
in the business of making sure our
 
05:08:03.910 --> 05:08:03.920 align:start position:0%
patients are happy you know the business
 
05:08:05.910 --> 05:08:05.920 align:start position:0%
model was mentioned but the worst
 
05:08:07.830 --> 05:08:07.840 align:start position:0%
business model you can have is uh first
 
05:08:09.430 --> 05:08:09.440 align:start position:0%
time you meet a patient to upset them
 
05:08:10.948 --> 05:08:10.958 align:start position:0%
and they never come back
 
05:08:13.750 --> 05:08:13.760 align:start position:0%
um you know so we're not really in the
 
05:08:15.830 --> 05:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
business of having patients be upset
 
05:08:17.910 --> 05:08:17.920 align:start position:0%
with the care that they've received and
 
05:08:19.110 --> 05:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
we're the boots on the ground we're
 
05:08:21.190 --> 05:08:21.200 align:start position:0%
proud to be there for our patients thank
 
05:08:22.550 --> 05:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
you any
 
05:08:23.830 --> 05:08:23.840 align:start position:0%
anyone else have a question for the
 
05:08:23.840 --> 05:08:27.510 align:start position:0%
anyone else have a question for the
doctor

05:08:27.510 --> 05:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:31.750 --> 05:08:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:34.390 --> 05:08:34.400 align:start position:0%
the next the chair recognizes julie
 
05:08:46.868 --> 05:08:46.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:49.750 --> 05:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
hi firstly i want to thank all of you
 
05:08:51.830 --> 05:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
for your service um and i also
 
05:08:53.190 --> 05:08:53.200 align:start position:0%
especially want to thank our
 
05:08:55.190 --> 05:08:55.200 align:start position:0%
representative danveyu
 
05:08:58.708 --> 05:08:58.718 align:start position:0%
for considering his constituents and uh
 
05:09:00.948 --> 05:09:00.958 align:start position:0%
sponsoring this bill and i'll try and
 
05:09:02.708 --> 05:09:02.718 align:start position:0%
keep this short and sweet i know things
 
05:09:04.310 --> 05:09:04.320 align:start position:0%
are running late so
 
05:09:06.628 --> 05:09:06.638 align:start position:0%
um i do implore you to vote in favor of
 
05:09:08.708 --> 05:09:08.718 align:start position:0%
this bill vision is one of our five
 
05:09:11.430 --> 05:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
senses and vital to optimal functioning
 
05:09:13.510 --> 05:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
for adults and children
 
05:09:15.910 --> 05:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
making glasses more affordable will
 
05:09:17.990 --> 05:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
support well-being for new hampshire's
 
05:09:18.000 --> 05:09:19.110 align:start position:0%
support well-being for new hampshire's
residents

05:09:19.110 --> 05:09:19.120 align:start position:0%
residents
 
05:09:22.390 --> 05:09:22.400 align:start position:0%
i've been reliant on glasses since i was
 
05:09:23.990 --> 05:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
11 years old
 
05:09:26.628 --> 05:09:26.638 align:start position:0%
as i've aged my vision has deteriorated
 
05:09:28.310 --> 05:09:28.320 align:start position:0%
and consequently glasses have become
 
05:09:30.390 --> 05:09:30.400 align:start position:0%
more and more expensive
 
05:09:32.470 --> 05:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
the last pair of glasses i brought at
 
05:09:36.230 --> 05:09:36.240 align:start position:0%
the eye doctors cost me over 600
 
05:09:38.788 --> 05:09:38.798 align:start position:0%
and those were not designer frames they
 
05:09:41.750 --> 05:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
were simply um regular frames
 
05:09:43.590 --> 05:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
with progressive lenses that would allow
 
05:09:47.030 --> 05:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
me to now see both near and far
 
05:09:49.910 --> 05:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
um the average low end cost for glasses
 
05:09:53.990 --> 05:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
at the optometrist is about 350 dollars
 
05:09:56.310 --> 05:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
online services offer glasses for as
 
05:09:58.230 --> 05:09:58.240 align:start position:0%
little as fifty dollars
 
05:10:00.470 --> 05:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
however access to your pupillary
 
05:10:03.030 --> 05:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
distance or pd is necessary to place an
 
05:10:05.430 --> 05:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
online order and that measurement is
 
05:10:07.830 --> 05:10:07.840 align:start position:0%
very very difficult to obtain here in
 
05:10:09.190 --> 05:10:09.200 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
05:10:11.750 --> 05:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
i wanted to share my experience to help
 
05:10:13.590 --> 05:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
you understand how important passing
 
05:10:14.948 --> 05:10:14.958 align:start position:0%
this bill is
 
05:10:18.230 --> 05:10:18.240 align:start position:0%
for the constituents and the consumers
 
05:10:21.190 --> 05:10:21.200 align:start position:0%
i need glasses 100 of the time
 
05:10:23.590 --> 05:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
so after purchasing the 600
 
05:10:25.590 --> 05:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
pair of progressive lenses from my
 
05:10:28.868 --> 05:10:28.878 align:start position:0%
optometrist i decided i needed to update
 
05:10:31.190 --> 05:10:31.200 align:start position:0%
my prescription sunglasses so i could
 
05:10:33.110 --> 05:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
see in the sun
 
05:10:35.750 --> 05:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
and having successfully purchased many
 
05:10:38.550 --> 05:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
pairs of glasses online and received
 
05:10:40.310 --> 05:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
this prescription and gotten glasses
 
05:10:42.550 --> 05:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
that work fine i decided to go the
 
05:10:44.868 --> 05:10:44.878 align:start position:0%
online route for my sunglasses it was
 
05:10:47.030 --> 05:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
then i realized my pd was missing from
 
05:10:49.670 --> 05:10:49.680 align:start position:0%
my prescription i contacted my eye
 
05:10:51.910 --> 05:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
doctor who simply refused to include my
 
05:10:54.948 --> 05:10:54.958 align:start position:0%
pd on that prescription and i'd recently
 
05:10:57.270 --> 05:10:57.280 align:start position:0%
moved from a state with a pd disclosure
 
05:11:00.150 --> 05:11:00.160 align:start position:0%
law so they were required to give you
 
05:11:01.750 --> 05:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
your pupillary distance with your
 
05:11:04.070 --> 05:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
eyeglass prescription
 
05:11:04.080 --> 05:11:04.868 align:start position:0%
eyeglass prescription
and

05:11:04.868 --> 05:11:04.878 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:11:06.788 --> 05:11:06.798 align:start position:0%
i had never had a problem ordering
 
05:11:08.390 --> 05:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
glasses online
 
05:11:10.230 --> 05:11:10.240 align:start position:0%
rarely spending more than a hundred
 
05:11:12.708 --> 05:11:12.718 align:start position:0%
dollars versus a three to four hundred
 
05:11:15.030 --> 05:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
dollar cost at my opticians
 
05:11:16.788 --> 05:11:16.798 align:start position:0%
it now felt like i was being held
 
05:11:18.628 --> 05:11:18.638 align:start position:0%
hostage and coerced into buying
 
05:11:21.350 --> 05:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
overpriced glasses from my optometrist
 
05:11:23.670 --> 05:11:23.680 align:start position:0%
it meant i'd need to pay need to pay for
 
05:11:26.230 --> 05:11:26.240 align:start position:0%
another eye exam now not covered by
 
05:11:28.708 --> 05:11:28.718 align:start position:0%
insurance take the risk of measuring my
 
05:11:31.190 --> 05:11:31.200 align:start position:0%
own pd or use the measurement that was
 
05:11:34.150 --> 05:11:34.160 align:start position:0%
now a few few years old i decided to
 
05:11:36.470 --> 05:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
order my sunglasses online using the pd
 
05:11:39.030 --> 05:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
i'd received a few years before
 
05:11:41.350 --> 05:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
those glasses fit me just fine and cost
 
05:11:43.910 --> 05:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
me over just about a hundred dollars
 
05:11:45.110 --> 05:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
versus the
 
05:11:47.590 --> 05:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
and fifty dollars i was quoted for the
 
05:11:49.990 --> 05:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
same glasses at the eye doctor
 
05:11:50.000 --> 05:11:50.948 align:start position:0%
same glasses at the eye doctor
um

05:11:50.948 --> 05:11:50.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:11:52.868 --> 05:11:52.878 align:start position:0%
i would have felt far more comfortable
 
05:11:55.190 --> 05:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
using the pd the optician clearly had
 
05:11:57.350 --> 05:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
just taken to fit my new progressive
 
05:11:58.788 --> 05:11:58.798 align:start position:0%
black glasses
 
05:12:01.270 --> 05:12:01.280 align:start position:0%
yet refused to disclose
 
05:12:03.750 --> 05:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
again i wear purchased online can cost
 
05:12:05.990 --> 05:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
as little as fifty dollars
 
05:12:07.830 --> 05:12:07.840 align:start position:0%
i've been wearing glasses i've ordered
 
05:12:10.230 --> 05:12:10.240 align:start position:0%
online for years never had a problem
 
05:12:13.430 --> 05:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
with vision or fit and frankly given the
 
05:12:15.830 --> 05:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
savings i'm more than willing to take
 
05:12:17.830 --> 05:12:17.840 align:start position:0%
the very small risk
 
05:12:20.708 --> 05:12:20.718 align:start position:0%
that they may be slightly inaccurate and
 
05:12:23.110 --> 05:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
i can order multiple pairs online at
 
05:12:26.150 --> 05:12:26.160 align:start position:0%
still far less cost than just one pair
 
05:12:28.788 --> 05:12:28.798 align:start position:0%
of glasses from the optometrist
 
05:12:30.628 --> 05:12:30.638 align:start position:0%
while it is possible it's not easy to
 
05:12:32.470 --> 05:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
find an eye doctor willing to share that
 
05:12:34.230 --> 05:12:34.240 align:start position:0%
measure the pd measurement in new
 
05:12:34.240 --> 05:12:35.430 align:start position:0%
measure the pd measurement in new
hampshire

05:12:35.430 --> 05:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
05:12:37.990 --> 05:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
one i did find had me sign a waiver that
 
05:12:39.750 --> 05:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
i would not hold them responsible for
 
05:12:41.990 --> 05:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
the fit of the glasses if i purchase
 
05:12:44.470 --> 05:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
them elsewhere that felt perfectly
 
05:12:46.310 --> 05:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
acceptable to me
 
05:12:48.868 --> 05:12:48.878 align:start position:0%
and as a housing advocate in nashua i
 
05:12:51.430 --> 05:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
work with people on low income it is my
 
05:12:53.510 --> 05:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
experience that many people simply
 
05:12:56.390 --> 05:12:56.400 align:start position:0%
cannot afford to pay the inflated
 
05:12:59.270 --> 05:12:59.280 align:start position:0%
inflated prices of glasses through their
 
05:12:59.280 --> 05:13:00.550 align:start position:0%
inflated prices of glasses through their
opticians

05:13:00.550 --> 05:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
opticians
 
05:13:03.270 --> 05:13:03.280 align:start position:0%
that they and or their children often go
 
05:13:05.670 --> 05:13:05.680 align:start position:0%
without the proper eyewear because they
 
05:13:07.350 --> 05:13:07.360 align:start position:0%
don't believe they have another option
 
05:13:09.270 --> 05:13:09.280 align:start position:0%
than spending the hundreds of dollars of
 
05:13:11.670 --> 05:13:11.680 align:start position:0%
glasses at their eye doctor
 
05:13:13.830 --> 05:13:13.840 align:start position:0%
and that cost is particularly prohibited
 
05:13:15.990 --> 05:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
for children's glasses which are more
 
05:13:18.550 --> 05:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
frequently lost or broken
 
05:13:20.628 --> 05:13:20.638 align:start position:0%
we already sell reading glasses without
 
05:13:22.788 --> 05:13:22.798 align:start position:0%
any prescription at all and studies have
 
05:13:25.110 --> 05:13:25.120 align:start position:0%
shown that people can tolerate a minimal
 
05:13:26.708 --> 05:13:26.718 align:start position:0%
imbalance in their eyewear with no
 
05:13:26.718 --> 05:13:28.230 align:start position:0%
imbalance in their eyewear with no
discomfort

05:13:28.230 --> 05:13:28.240 align:start position:0%
discomfort
 
05:13:30.470 --> 05:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
this bill will help make vision more
 
05:13:32.470 --> 05:13:32.480 align:start position:0%
affordable and more accessible to new
 
05:13:35.110 --> 05:13:35.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire adults and children and as a
 
05:13:37.910 --> 05:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
state that values individual freedoms
 
05:13:40.390 --> 05:13:40.400 align:start position:0%
and minimal government involvement i
 
05:13:42.390 --> 05:13:42.400 align:start position:0%
think our citizens deserve the freedom
 
05:13:44.628 --> 05:13:44.638 align:start position:0%
of choice on where to purchase their
 
05:13:46.708 --> 05:13:46.718 align:start position:0%
eyewear and at what cost
 
05:13:49.590 --> 05:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
again i implore you to pass this bill
 
05:13:51.110 --> 05:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
and i just wanted to add that i
 
05:13:53.190 --> 05:13:53.200 align:start position:0%
understand the rep from warby parker was
 
05:13:55.670 --> 05:13:55.680 align:start position:0%
unable to be here today because of covid
 
05:13:57.830 --> 05:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
and i do hope his written testimony will
 
05:14:00.550 --> 05:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
be given the credence that it deserves
 
05:14:02.628 --> 05:14:02.638 align:start position:0%
so thank you for your time thank you so
 
05:14:02.638 --> 05:14:08.708 align:start position:0%
so thank you for your time thank you so
much

05:14:08.708 --> 05:14:08.718 align:start position:0%

sorry

05:14:09.750 --> 05:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
05:14:11.270 --> 05:14:11.280 align:start position:0%
no questions
 
05:14:13.190 --> 05:14:13.200 align:start position:0%
i don't see any
 
05:14:16.390 --> 05:14:16.400 align:start position:0%

um like i said i'm dr deidre cullen and
 
05:14:48.948 --> 05:14:48.958 align:start position:0%
i'm here to just share my perspective in
 
05:14:51.030 --> 05:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill
 
05:14:52.550 --> 05:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
uh my optometric colleagues and i
 
05:14:53.990 --> 05:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
understand the position of this bill's
 
05:14:56.550 --> 05:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor representative veyu and we
 
05:14:59.030 --> 05:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
do support a free market competition and
 
05:15:00.708 --> 05:15:00.718 align:start position:0%
the freedom of all patients to purchase
 
05:15:02.948 --> 05:15:02.958 align:start position:0%
their eyeglasses wherever they choose
 
05:15:04.550 --> 05:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
however mandating the inclusion of a
 
05:15:06.390 --> 05:15:06.400 align:start position:0%
pupillary distance measurement on every
 
05:15:08.310 --> 05:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
eyeglass prescription thus shifting a
 
05:15:10.070 --> 05:15:10.080 align:start position:0%
responsibility from the ophthalmic
 
05:15:12.550 --> 05:15:12.560 align:start position:0%
dispenser to the prescriber is
 
05:15:14.310 --> 05:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
ultimately a degradation of the existing
 
05:15:16.948 --> 05:15:16.958 align:start position:0%
ophthalmic dispensing statute
 
05:15:18.708 --> 05:15:18.718 align:start position:0%
doing such would do a disservice to the
 
05:15:20.628 --> 05:15:20.638 align:start position:0%
patient that is reducing the quality of
 
05:15:20.638 --> 05:15:21.590 align:start position:0%
patient that is reducing the quality of
care

05:15:21.590 --> 05:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
care
 
05:15:23.590 --> 05:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
additionally it is an added burden to
 
05:15:26.070 --> 05:15:26.080 align:start position:0%
the prescriber prescribing provider and
 
05:15:28.310 --> 05:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
an attempt to reduce or eliminate the
 
05:15:29.670 --> 05:15:29.680 align:start position:0%
valuable role of the ophthalmic
 
05:15:31.670 --> 05:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
dispenser and when we talk about quality
 
05:15:33.750 --> 05:15:33.760 align:start position:0%
of care what i'm really concerned about
 
05:15:35.990 --> 05:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
is the kids that are getting glasses
 
05:15:38.070 --> 05:15:38.080 align:start position:0%
i've had several patients bring their
 
05:15:40.150 --> 05:15:40.160 align:start position:0%
child's prescription in that they
 
05:15:42.310 --> 05:15:42.320 align:start position:0%
got online and it's not just the
 
05:15:43.750 --> 05:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
pupillary distance that i'm concerned
 
05:15:45.830 --> 05:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
about but the actual prescription was
 
05:15:47.910 --> 05:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
made wrong i had one patient whose right
 
05:15:49.910 --> 05:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
eye was made in their left eye and their
 
05:15:51.270 --> 05:15:51.280 align:start position:0%
left eye prescription was made in the
 
05:15:52.948 --> 05:15:52.958 align:start position:0%
right eye and if you're a child you
 
05:15:54.708 --> 05:15:54.718 align:start position:0%
might not be able to say something's
 
05:15:56.150 --> 05:15:56.160 align:start position:0%
wrong they might just think that's the
 
05:15:57.510 --> 05:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
way the world's supposed to look and
 
05:15:59.750 --> 05:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
that really concerns me
 
05:16:01.190 --> 05:16:01.200 align:start position:0%
prescription eyeglasses are a custom
 
05:16:03.110 --> 05:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
made medical device not simply a retail
 
05:16:06.628 --> 05:16:06.638 align:start position:0%
product i get shopping online i'm 36 my
 
05:16:08.150 --> 05:16:08.160 align:start position:0%
generation has been shopping online
 
05:16:10.310 --> 05:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
since our early 20s so i get it and i
 
05:16:11.910 --> 05:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
get a free market but this is not the
 
05:16:14.470 --> 05:16:14.480 align:start position:0%
next nike shoe this is eyeglass
 
05:16:16.230 --> 05:16:16.240 align:start position:0%
prescription and this is something that
 
05:16:17.990 --> 05:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
people need to be able to see clearly
 
05:16:19.990 --> 05:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
with and operate
 
05:16:22.550 --> 05:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
vehicles with um and navigate their
 
05:16:25.830 --> 05:16:25.840 align:start position:0%
world and learn in school
 
05:16:27.350 --> 05:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
an optometrist or ophthalmologist
 
05:16:28.788 --> 05:16:28.798 align:start position:0%
determines the essential aspects of an
 
05:16:30.550 --> 05:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
eyeglass prescription the eyeglasses are
 
05:16:32.868 --> 05:16:32.878 align:start position:0%
fit fabricated delivered and adjusted to
 
05:16:33.990 --> 05:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
the patient through an ophthalmic
 
05:16:35.990 --> 05:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
dispenser and they play a critical role
 
05:16:37.430 --> 05:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
in the ultimate visual outcome for the

patient
 
05:16:40.230 --> 05:16:40.240 align:start position:0%
while many online vendors have entered
 
05:16:41.910 --> 05:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
the market in the sale and fabrication
 
05:16:43.510 --> 05:16:43.520 align:start position:0%
of prescription eyewear most of them are
 
05:16:45.190 --> 05:16:45.200 align:start position:0%
not providing complete ophthalmic
 
05:16:47.510 --> 05:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
dispensing services particularly in
 
05:16:49.030 --> 05:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
regard to the fitting measuring and
 
05:16:50.868 --> 05:16:50.878 align:start position:0%
adjusting of glasses and instead they
 
05:16:52.550 --> 05:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
are just shifting that responsibility to
 
05:16:54.070 --> 05:16:54.080 align:start position:0%
other parties or eliminating that
 
05:16:56.310 --> 05:16:56.320 align:start position:0%
component altogether
 
05:16:57.910 --> 05:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
as you will note in roman numeral one of
 
05:17:00.868 --> 05:17:00.878 align:start position:0%

one
 
05:17:03.670 --> 05:17:03.680 align:start position:0%
the definition of ophthalmic dispensing
 
05:17:05.350 --> 05:17:05.360 align:start position:0%
specifically includes the taking of
 
05:17:07.270 --> 05:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
measurements to determine the size shape
 
05:17:09.110 --> 05:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
and specifications of the spectacle
 
05:17:11.510 --> 05:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
lenses frames or lens forms best suited
 
05:17:13.190 --> 05:17:13.200 align:start position:0%
to the wearer's needs
 
05:17:14.788 --> 05:17:14.798 align:start position:0%
many optometrists and ophthalmologists
 
05:17:16.390 --> 05:17:16.400 align:start position:0%
do not routinely measure pupillary
 
05:17:18.868 --> 05:17:18.878 align:start position:0%
distance as part of an eye examination
 
05:17:20.550 --> 05:17:20.560 align:start position:0%
however if the pupillary distance has
 
05:17:22.150 --> 05:17:22.160 align:start position:0%
been measured at the time during the eye
 
05:17:23.430 --> 05:17:23.440 align:start position:0%
examination then it is part of the
 
05:17:25.110 --> 05:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
medical record and it is property of the
 
05:17:26.628 --> 05:17:26.638 align:start position:0%
patient and it is the prescriber's
 
05:17:27.990 --> 05:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
responsibility to release that
 
05:17:29.670 --> 05:17:29.680 align:start position:0%
information and i understand that that
 
05:17:31.510 --> 05:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
should be the way that it is the bill
 
05:17:32.788 --> 05:17:32.798 align:start position:0%
sponsor appears to believe that the
 
05:17:34.150 --> 05:17:34.160 align:start position:0%
prescribing optometrist or
 
05:17:35.590 --> 05:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
ophthalmologist is intentionally
 
05:17:37.190 --> 05:17:37.200 align:start position:0%
omitting or withholding information
 
05:17:39.350 --> 05:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
however in the vast majority of cases it
 
05:17:41.270 --> 05:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
is simply that the measurement has just
 
05:17:42.868 --> 05:17:42.878 align:start position:0%
not been done because it's not part of a
 
05:17:46.310 --> 05:17:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:47.750 --> 05:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
if there are cases where the information
 
05:17:49.030 --> 05:17:49.040 align:start position:0%
is available and being withheld it
 
05:17:50.230 --> 05:17:50.240 align:start position:0%
should be brought to the attention of
 
05:17:51.670 --> 05:17:51.680 align:start position:0%
the state board not addressed with a
 
05:17:53.430 --> 05:17:53.440 align:start position:0%
legislative change that would have a far
 
05:17:55.510 --> 05:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
greater impact
 
05:17:57.270 --> 05:17:57.280 align:start position:0%
when asked during an examination for a
 
05:17:58.948 --> 05:17:58.958 align:start position:0%
public distance if it has not yet been
 
05:18:00.628 --> 05:18:00.638 align:start position:0%
done some providers are comfortable with
 
05:18:03.830 --> 05:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
performing the measurement themselves as
 
05:18:05.830 --> 05:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
as i've done myself for from time to
 
05:18:07.430 --> 05:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
time for patients that say look if you
 
05:18:09.190 --> 05:18:09.200 align:start position:0%
give that to me or not i'm going to go
 
05:18:10.948 --> 05:18:10.958 align:start position:0%
online get my glasses i'll say okay let
 
05:18:12.470 --> 05:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
me just get this measurement if you know
 
05:18:13.670 --> 05:18:13.680 align:start position:0%
i'd rather you have the measurement than
 
05:18:13.680 --> 05:18:14.868 align:start position:0%
i'd rather you have the measurement than
not

05:18:14.868 --> 05:18:14.878 align:start position:0%
not
 
05:18:16.230 --> 05:18:16.240 align:start position:0%
however many optometrists and
 
05:18:17.350 --> 05:18:17.360 align:start position:0%
ophthalmologists prefer that these
 
05:18:18.948 --> 05:18:18.958 align:start position:0%
measurements be taken by the ophthalmic
 
05:18:18.958 --> 05:18:20.150 align:start position:0%
measurements be taken by the ophthalmic
dispenser

05:18:20.150 --> 05:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
dispenser
 
05:18:21.670 --> 05:18:21.680 align:start position:0%
that will be fitting and manufacturing
 
05:18:23.750 --> 05:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
the lenses not because the prescriber
 
05:18:25.030 --> 05:18:25.040 align:start position:0%
does not know how to do it or because
 
05:18:26.550 --> 05:18:26.560 align:start position:0%
they are trying to preserve an eyeglass
 
05:18:26.560 --> 05:18:27.430 align:start position:0%
they are trying to preserve an eyeglass
sail

05:18:27.430 --> 05:18:27.440 align:start position:0%
sail
 
05:18:28.708 --> 05:18:28.718 align:start position:0%
but simply because the trained and
 
05:18:30.628 --> 05:18:30.638 align:start position:0%
registered ophthalmic dispenser does a
 
05:18:33.030 --> 05:18:33.040 align:start position:0%
better job of it because it is
 
05:18:35.110 --> 05:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
literally their job
 
05:18:36.788 --> 05:18:36.798 align:start position:0%
their training is focused specifically
 
05:18:38.628 --> 05:18:38.638 align:start position:0%
on the fitting and measuring of glasses
 
05:18:40.150 --> 05:18:40.160 align:start position:0%
they often have equipment that is far
 
05:18:41.510 --> 05:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
more accurate than what a doctor might
 
05:18:42.948 --> 05:18:42.958 align:start position:0%
use in his exam room to measure
 
05:18:44.708 --> 05:18:44.718 align:start position:0%
pupillary distance and they take a wide
 
05:18:46.788 --> 05:18:46.798 align:start position:0%
variety of important measurements
 
05:18:49.270 --> 05:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
including optical centers the vertical
 
05:18:50.708 --> 05:18:50.718 align:start position:0%
positioning of the prescription in the
 
05:18:50.718 --> 05:18:51.670 align:start position:0%
positioning of the prescription in the
frame

05:18:51.670 --> 05:18:51.680 align:start position:0%
frame
 
05:18:53.670 --> 05:18:53.680 align:start position:0%
the segment height the specific the
 
05:18:55.990 --> 05:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
specification of where distance and near
 
05:18:57.750 --> 05:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
prescription should be located in a
 
05:19:00.868 --> 05:19:00.878 align:start position:0%
multi-focal or a progressive lens
 
05:19:02.708 --> 05:19:02.718 align:start position:0%
the vertex distance the distance between
 
05:19:04.390 --> 05:19:04.400 align:start position:0%
the glasses and the surface of the eyes
 
05:19:07.030 --> 05:19:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:08.390 --> 05:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
ophthalmic dispensing is not
 
05:19:10.470 --> 05:19:10.480 align:start position:0%
insignificant the state of new hampshire
 
05:19:12.390 --> 05:19:12.400 align:start position:0%
requires that all ophthalmic dispensers
 
05:19:13.990 --> 05:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
be registered with the state and they
 
05:19:15.430 --> 05:19:15.440 align:start position:0%
are required to complete annual
 
05:19:17.430 --> 05:19:17.440 align:start position:0%
continuing education
 
05:19:19.510 --> 05:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
if a patient chooses to obtain glasses
 
05:19:21.350 --> 05:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
via an online or virtual authoric
 
05:19:22.788 --> 05:19:22.798 align:start position:0%
dispenser then they are accepting the
 
05:19:24.868 --> 05:19:24.878 align:start position:0%
virtual dispensing process with both its
 
05:19:27.190 --> 05:19:27.200 align:start position:0%
benefits and its limitations
 
05:19:28.868 --> 05:19:28.878 align:start position:0%
the online retailer is able to reduce
 
05:19:30.310 --> 05:19:30.320 align:start position:0%
their prices because they are cutting
 
05:19:31.510 --> 05:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
out portions of the ophthalmic
 
05:19:33.270 --> 05:19:33.280 align:start position:0%
dispensing and saving on the cost of
 
05:19:36.708 --> 05:19:36.718 align:start position:0%
employed trained professionals
 
05:19:37.830 --> 05:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
i'm going to skip a little bit through
 
05:19:39.270 --> 05:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
because i know you have this testimony
 
05:19:40.470 --> 05:19:40.480 align:start position:0%
and i just want to save a little bit of
 
05:19:42.708 --> 05:19:42.718 align:start position:0%
time for everybody we agree that every
 
05:19:44.230 --> 05:19:44.240 align:start position:0%
patient should walk out of their exam
 
05:19:45.670 --> 05:19:45.680 align:start position:0%
with their eyeglass prescription without
 
05:19:47.190 --> 05:19:47.200 align:start position:0%
having to request it which is already
 
05:19:49.350 --> 05:19:49.360 align:start position:0%
federally mandated by the ftc eyeglass

rule
 
05:19:51.590 --> 05:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
and that the patient should be free of
 
05:19:53.910 --> 05:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
any feeling of pressure or intimidation
 
05:19:55.190 --> 05:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
to purchase glasses from their
 
05:19:57.350 --> 05:19:57.360 align:start position:0%
prescriber however we also firmly
 
05:19:59.030 --> 05:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
believe in the value
 
05:20:01.590 --> 05:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
and the role of the ophthalmic dispenser
 
05:20:03.510 --> 05:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
requiring every optometrist and every
 
05:20:05.270 --> 05:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
ophthalmologist to add the measurement
 
05:20:07.590 --> 05:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
and documentation of pupillary distance
 
05:20:09.110 --> 05:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
to every eye examination every
 
05:20:10.948 --> 05:20:10.958 align:start position:0%
prescription is an unnecessary burden on
 
05:20:13.110 --> 05:20:13.120 align:start position:0%

however more importantly is that

this bill
 
05:20:19.510 --> 05:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
proposes to reduce the role of
 
05:20:21.910 --> 05:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
ophthalmic dispensing and thus reduces a
 
05:20:23.910 --> 05:20:23.920 align:start position:0%
valuable service to patients that
 
05:20:27.590 --> 05:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
results in lower quality of patient care

i thank you for your time and for your

question i
 
05:21:13.750 --> 05:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
i don't want to guess anything um but
 
05:21:15.110 --> 05:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
they have to be certified in the state
 
05:21:16.150 --> 05:21:16.160 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire that's all i can tell
 
05:21:16.160 --> 05:21:17.750 align:start position:0%

05:21:17.750 --> 05:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:21:17.760 --> 05:21:19.190 align:start position:0%
you
follow-up

05:21:19.190 --> 05:21:19.200 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
05:21:20.628 --> 05:21:20.638 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and also thank you
 
05:21:21.750 --> 05:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
for the follow-up
 
05:21:23.670 --> 05:21:23.680 align:start position:0%
in regards to the
 
05:21:23.680 --> 05:21:25.030 align:start position:0%
in regards to the
optician

05:21:25.030 --> 05:21:25.040 align:start position:0%
optician
 
05:21:26.628 --> 05:21:26.638 align:start position:0%
is there any reason why the optician
 
05:21:29.430 --> 05:21:29.440 align:start position:0%
would not be required to give the pd to
 
05:21:31.190 --> 05:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
patients so requested before they left
 
05:21:32.788 --> 05:21:32.798 align:start position:0%
the office
 
05:21:32.798 --> 05:21:35.990 align:start position:0%
the office
um

05:21:35.990 --> 05:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:38.948 --> 05:21:38.958 align:start position:0%
i think that's up to right now business
 
05:21:41.030 --> 05:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
to business and
 
05:21:42.868 --> 05:21:42.878 align:start position:0%
um and i think that some
 
05:21:45.590 --> 05:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
opticians will do that um just based on
 
05:21:48.470 --> 05:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
where they work and others will not do
 
05:21:48.480 --> 05:21:51.430 align:start position:0%
where they work and others will not do
that

05:21:51.430 --> 05:21:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:53.590 --> 05:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
another one
 
05:21:56.230 --> 05:21:56.240 align:start position:0%
what i heard before is 90 of the
 
05:21:58.230 --> 05:21:58.240 align:start position:0%
opticians offices are owned by the
 
05:22:00.948 --> 05:22:00.958 align:start position:0%
optometrist or the ophthalmologist
 
05:22:03.510 --> 05:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
so therefore if the
 
05:22:06.230 --> 05:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
optician wants the correct pd because it
 
05:22:08.390 --> 05:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
seems to be concerned about that
 
05:22:10.230 --> 05:22:10.240 align:start position:0%
why not have the patient go to the
 
05:22:12.708 --> 05:22:12.718 align:start position:0%
optician which is owned by the office to
 
05:22:14.868 --> 05:22:14.878 align:start position:0%
get the pd that's what i that's what i
 
05:22:14.878 --> 05:22:15.590 align:start position:0%
get the pd that's what i that's what i
do

05:22:15.590 --> 05:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
do
 
05:22:18.390 --> 05:22:18.400 align:start position:0%
when a patient um
 
05:22:20.868 --> 05:22:20.878 align:start position:0%
will ask for it um and we know that
 
05:22:23.110 --> 05:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
they're gonna go you know somewhere else
 
05:22:25.270 --> 05:22:25.280 align:start position:0%
or you know maybe online but we have to
 
05:22:26.948 --> 05:22:26.958 align:start position:0%
just educate them we really don't want
 
05:22:28.470 --> 05:22:28.480 align:start position:0%
you to do that but i will send them out
 
05:22:30.150 --> 05:22:30.160 align:start position:0%
to the opticians and i will have them do
 
05:22:32.230 --> 05:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
that it just takes extra time
 
05:22:36.788 --> 05:22:36.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:39.590 --> 05:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
representative cushman
 
05:22:41.110 --> 05:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
05:22:43.430 --> 05:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
05:22:45.830 --> 05:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
would you believe that i was a patient
 
05:22:48.310 --> 05:22:48.320 align:start position:0%
at concord eye center and i had asked
 
05:22:49.990 --> 05:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
for my prescription
 
05:22:52.070 --> 05:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
four years ago and
 
05:22:53.670 --> 05:22:53.680 align:start position:0%
was handed a prescription that had
 
05:22:56.230 --> 05:22:56.240 align:start position:0%
missing information on it and i had to
 
05:22:59.430 --> 05:22:59.440 align:start position:0%
call and go back and i had to
 
05:23:01.830 --> 05:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
pretty pretty much fight to get the
 
05:23:03.990 --> 05:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
information that i needed to order
 
05:23:07.110 --> 05:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:09.270 --> 05:23:09.280 align:start position:0%
so the information that you were missing
 
05:23:10.830 --> 05:23:10.840 align:start position:0%
was a
 
05:23:10.840 --> 05:23:12.628 align:start position:0%
was a
pd

05:23:12.628 --> 05:23:12.638 align:start position:0%
pd
 
05:23:14.628 --> 05:23:14.638 align:start position:0%
i can't recall since it was four years
 
05:23:16.948 --> 05:23:16.958 align:start position:0%
ago um but there were no additional
 
05:23:18.788 --> 05:23:18.798 align:start position:0%
measurements that needed to be taken
 
05:23:20.628 --> 05:23:20.638 align:start position:0%
someone was just withholding it and
 
05:23:22.948 --> 05:23:22.958 align:start position:0%
wrote it down when i came and gave me
 
05:23:25.270 --> 05:23:25.280 align:start position:0%
the rest of the information
 
05:23:26.390 --> 05:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
um i
 
05:23:29.110 --> 05:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
can't speak to that case specifically um
 
05:23:29.120 --> 05:23:29.830 align:start position:0%
can't speak to that case specifically um
but

05:23:29.830 --> 05:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:23:31.830 --> 05:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
i do know that you have to have a recent
 
05:23:33.510 --> 05:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
exam within two years to get your
 
05:23:33.520 --> 05:23:34.628 align:start position:0%
exam within two years to get your
prescription

05:23:34.628 --> 05:23:34.638 align:start position:0%
prescription
 
05:23:36.070 --> 05:23:36.080 align:start position:0%
and was it within two years that you
 
05:23:38.390 --> 05:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
were asking for the prescription
 
05:23:40.788 --> 05:23:40.798 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am it was that day i asked for
 
05:23:43.190 --> 05:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
the prescription after my exam and then
 
05:23:44.868 --> 05:23:44.878 align:start position:0%
walked out with an incomplete
 
05:23:44.878 --> 05:23:47.030 align:start position:0%
walked out with an incomplete
prescription

05:23:47.030 --> 05:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
prescription
 
05:23:49.190 --> 05:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
um so i i mean i don't know what
 
05:23:51.750 --> 05:23:51.760 align:start position:0%
happened in that situation um i don't
 
05:23:51.760 --> 05:23:52.708 align:start position:0%
happened in that situation um i don't
think

05:23:52.708 --> 05:23:52.718 align:start position:0%
think
 
05:23:56.548 --> 05:23:56.558 align:start position:0%
i was the doctor situation
 
05:23:58.628 --> 05:23:58.638 align:start position:0%
um but you know the only thing that we
 
05:24:00.868 --> 05:24:00.878 align:start position:0%
don't include is the pupillary distance
 
05:24:02.470 --> 05:24:02.480 align:start position:0%
at this point but all of the other
 
05:24:03.990 --> 05:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
numbers should be there so i'm not sure
 
05:24:05.430 --> 05:24:05.440 align:start position:0%
what happened in that specific situation
 
05:24:09.510 --> 05:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:12.230 --> 05:24:12.240 align:start position:0%
any further question yes yes hello
 
05:24:14.310 --> 05:24:14.320 align:start position:0%
representative delemus welcome to the
 
05:24:23.510 --> 05:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:25.670 --> 05:24:25.680 align:start position:0%
microphone please
 
05:24:27.910 --> 05:24:27.920 align:start position:0%
no additional charge for that
 
05:24:27.920 --> 05:24:37.990 align:start position:0%
no additional charge for that
welcome

05:24:37.990 --> 05:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:39.830 --> 05:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
push it in any order and when you get
 
05:24:41.750 --> 05:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
louder that's what you do
 
05:24:43.830 --> 05:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
can you hear me now much better okay
 
05:24:45.110 --> 05:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:24:48.070 --> 05:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
i had the same experience with an
 
05:24:50.708 --> 05:24:50.718 align:start position:0%
ophthalmologist's office in somersworth
 
05:24:52.070 --> 05:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
05:24:52.080 --> 05:24:53.270 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
and

05:24:53.270 --> 05:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:24:56.070 --> 05:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
i had had my exam
 
05:24:58.868 --> 05:24:58.878 align:start position:0%
i had researched the
 
05:25:00.948 --> 05:25:00.958 align:start position:0%
silhouettes that i wanted
 
05:25:00.958 --> 05:25:01.910 align:start position:0%
silhouettes that i wanted
and

05:25:01.910 --> 05:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:25:04.070 --> 05:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
i didn't have the pupillary distance i
 
05:25:06.708 --> 05:25:06.718 align:start position:0%
went back to my ophthalmologist and i
 
05:25:09.830 --> 05:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
called them like that the next day
 
05:25:12.470 --> 05:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
and said i don't have my pd
 
05:25:14.390 --> 05:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
and they refused to give it to me they
 
05:25:16.310 --> 05:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
weren't going to measure it i just had
 
05:25:18.390 --> 05:25:18.400 align:start position:0%
my eyes exam examined
 
05:25:21.910 --> 05:25:21.920 align:start position:0%
and fortunately i had a personal friend
 
05:25:25.190 --> 05:25:25.200 align:start position:0%
who was in the dispensing questions
 
05:25:25.200 --> 05:25:26.230 align:start position:0%
who was in the dispensing questions
please

05:25:26.230 --> 05:25:26.240 align:start position:0%
please
 
05:25:29.590 --> 05:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
would you believe okay that that person
 
05:25:31.510 --> 05:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
said that
 
05:25:34.150 --> 05:25:34.160 align:start position:0%
that person actually just as a friend
 
05:25:37.510 --> 05:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
had done the pd for me and that was how
 
05:25:40.150 --> 05:25:40.160 align:start position:0%
i was able to get my glasses but i have
 
05:25:40.160 --> 05:25:40.948 align:start position:0%
i was able to get my glasses but i have
a

05:25:40.948 --> 05:25:40.958 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:25:43.910 --> 05:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
400 savings
 
05:25:46.470 --> 05:25:46.480 align:start position:0%
from what it would have cost me in a in
 
05:25:50.310 --> 05:25:50.320 align:start position:0%
an office as opposed to going online
 
05:25:52.230 --> 05:25:52.240 align:start position:0%
would you believe that
 
05:25:54.150 --> 05:25:54.160 align:start position:0%
um yes
 
05:25:55.670 --> 05:25:55.680 align:start position:0%
i would believe that
 
05:25:57.030 --> 05:25:57.040 align:start position:0%
but again i would just say that my
 
05:25:59.350 --> 05:25:59.360 align:start position:0%
concern is when prescriptions are not
 
05:26:00.948 --> 05:26:00.958 align:start position:0%
made correctly and especially when it's
 
05:26:01.990 --> 05:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
a child
 
05:26:04.150 --> 05:26:04.160 align:start position:0%
um so you know you might be able to tell
 
05:26:05.670 --> 05:26:05.680 align:start position:0%
that your prescription wasn't made
 
05:26:07.830 --> 05:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
correctly if it wasn't made correctly
 
05:26:09.910 --> 05:26:09.920 align:start position:0%
but a child might not be able to
 
05:26:11.190 --> 05:26:11.200 align:start position:0%
verbalize that
 
05:26:11.200 --> 05:26:12.150 align:start position:0%
verbalize that
um

05:26:12.150 --> 05:26:12.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:26:14.310 --> 05:26:14.320 align:start position:0%
and you know just in general
 
05:26:15.830 --> 05:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
prescriptions not being made correctly
 
05:26:17.350 --> 05:26:17.360 align:start position:0%
because there's not as many checks and
 
05:26:19.110 --> 05:26:19.120 align:start position:0%
balances with online companies as there
 
05:26:21.590 --> 05:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
are with you know brick and mortar um
 
05:26:24.070 --> 05:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
shop um so my concern is really just for
 
05:26:28.150 --> 05:26:28.160 align:start position:0%
you know the safety of patients um so
 
05:26:30.310 --> 05:26:30.320 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions
 
05:26:34.708 --> 05:26:34.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:36.628 --> 05:26:36.638 align:start position:0%
i don't think is this working
 
05:26:38.948 --> 05:26:38.958 align:start position:0%
wonderfully good thank you
 
05:26:41.510 --> 05:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
would you believe that i also
 
05:26:44.868 --> 05:26:44.878 align:start position:0%
am a patient of concrete eye center
 
05:26:47.430 --> 05:26:47.440 align:start position:0%
in fact about two weeks ago
 
05:26:50.230 --> 05:26:50.240 align:start position:0%
and that every single time and i go once
 
05:26:51.350 --> 05:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
a year
 
05:26:54.868 --> 05:26:54.878 align:start position:0%
i always get a prescription
 
05:26:58.708 --> 05:26:58.718 align:start position:0%
and i've always been extremely happy and
 
05:26:59.990 --> 05:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
it's only
 
05:27:01.670 --> 05:27:01.680 align:start position:0%
recently that
 
05:27:01.680 --> 05:27:02.868 align:start position:0%
recently that
they

05:27:02.868 --> 05:27:02.878 align:start position:0%
they
 
05:27:03.830 --> 05:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
have a
 
05:27:05.910 --> 05:27:05.920 align:start position:0%
somebody in that office
 
05:27:07.990 --> 05:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
that deals with adjustments for the
 
05:27:08.000 --> 05:27:09.590 align:start position:0%
that deals with adjustments for the
glasses

05:27:09.590 --> 05:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
glasses
 
05:27:11.430 --> 05:27:11.440 align:start position:0%
so contrary to some others on the
 
05:27:14.390 --> 05:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
committee i've had an excellent
 
05:27:17.030 --> 05:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
relationship with that particular office
 
05:27:22.708 --> 05:27:22.718 align:start position:0%

thank you committee
 
05:27:51.990 --> 05:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
i was actually here to speak about the
 
05:27:54.390 --> 05:27:54.400 align:start position:0%
uh hearing after this
 
05:27:55.830 --> 05:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
but but no now
 
05:27:57.750 --> 05:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
i'm glad i walked in on this one because
 
05:27:59.990 --> 05:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
i am a former optician i was licensed to
 
05:28:00.000 --> 05:28:01.510 align:start position:0%
i am a former optician i was licensed to
massachusetts

05:28:01.510 --> 05:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
massachusetts
 
05:28:04.390 --> 05:28:04.400 align:start position:0%
from about 1994 until i let my license
 
05:28:04.400 --> 05:28:05.830 align:start position:0%
from about 1994 until i let my license
expire

05:28:05.830 --> 05:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
expire
 
05:28:07.990 --> 05:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
approximately two thousand
 
05:28:10.390 --> 05:28:10.400 align:start position:0%
um i started off working at lens
 
05:28:14.390 --> 05:28:14.400 align:start position:0%
crafters learning how to make glasses um
 
05:28:15.990 --> 05:28:16.000 align:start position:0%
and then learning all the parts of the
 
05:28:16.000 --> 05:28:17.110 align:start position:0%
and then learning all the parts of the
business

05:28:17.110 --> 05:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
business
 
05:28:20.390 --> 05:28:20.400 align:start position:0%
and i also knew what the markup was
 
05:28:23.350 --> 05:28:23.360 align:start position:0%
so i see this bill requiring the pd on
 
05:28:25.990 --> 05:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
an eyeglass prescription as about um
 
05:28:28.868 --> 05:28:28.878 align:start position:0%
consumer choice and in the free market
 
05:28:28.878 --> 05:28:30.070 align:start position:0%
consumer choice and in the free market
um

05:28:30.070 --> 05:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:28:31.430 --> 05:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
i was young
 
05:28:35.110 --> 05:28:35.120 align:start position:0%
i didn't i was plano at the time and
 
05:28:36.948 --> 05:28:36.958 align:start position:0%
i knew someday i would need glasses to
 
05:28:39.190 --> 05:28:39.200 align:start position:0%
read and i knew that i would go
 
05:28:41.350 --> 05:28:41.360 align:start position:0%
drugstore glasses because i knew what
 
05:28:42.948 --> 05:28:42.958 align:start position:0%
the markup was it
 
05:28:45.590 --> 05:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
was typically about three times what the
 
05:28:45.600 --> 05:28:47.030 align:start position:0%
was typically about three times what the
um

05:28:47.030 --> 05:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:28:48.390 --> 05:28:48.400 align:start position:0%
the dispensary
 
05:28:51.590 --> 05:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
is paying in their businesses expenses
 
05:28:54.230 --> 05:28:54.240 align:start position:0%
and so these online businesses such as
 
05:28:56.548 --> 05:28:56.558 align:start position:0%
any uh or even
 
05:28:58.310 --> 05:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
another brick-and-mortar business that's
 
05:28:58.320 --> 05:29:00.390 align:start position:0%
another brick-and-mortar business that's
discount

05:29:00.390 --> 05:29:00.400 align:start position:0%
discount
 
05:29:02.788 --> 05:29:02.798 align:start position:0%
they're being edged out by a doctor
 
05:29:05.510 --> 05:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
that's refusing to give a pd you know if
 
05:29:06.948 --> 05:29:06.958 align:start position:0%
someone can't if you had your own
 
05:29:09.030 --> 05:29:09.040 align:start position:0%
business and someone came in and let's
 
05:29:11.430 --> 05:29:11.440 align:start position:0%
say they broke their glasses at
 
05:29:13.670 --> 05:29:13.680 align:start position:0%
at the bridge and they weren't there
 
05:29:15.110 --> 05:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
and they wanted to
 
05:29:16.628 --> 05:29:16.638 align:start position:0%
call in an order
 
05:29:18.708 --> 05:29:18.718 align:start position:0%
you know without the pd
 
05:29:22.310 --> 05:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
it it it's a roadblock to commerce you
 
05:29:25.110 --> 05:29:25.120 align:start position:0%
know you've got a a new customer and
 
05:29:26.708 --> 05:29:26.718 align:start position:0%
they should not be forced to have to
 
05:29:29.750 --> 05:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
spend money on on an eye exam
 
05:29:31.670 --> 05:29:31.680 align:start position:0%
or do business with that particular
 
05:29:34.070 --> 05:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
doctor who owns the
 
05:29:37.830 --> 05:29:37.840 align:start position:0%
dispensary uh just because of that and
 
05:29:40.230 --> 05:29:40.240 align:start position:0%
what it what it's doing when you see
 
05:29:42.070 --> 05:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
like zeni they'll give you the ruler
 
05:29:43.590 --> 05:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
with the little notch on it and that's
 
05:29:45.830 --> 05:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
all fine if you're like plus one
 
05:29:47.350 --> 05:29:47.360 align:start position:0%
but stephen king
 
05:29:49.590 --> 05:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
you know that wouldn't work for him um
 
05:29:52.788 --> 05:29:52.798 align:start position:0%
obviously he has has has the money to
 
05:29:55.590 --> 05:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
pay top dollar but a regular consumer
 
05:29:58.628 --> 05:29:58.638 align:start position:0%
let's say they're minus 10 or whatnot
 
05:30:00.548 --> 05:30:00.558 align:start position:0%
if they make a mistake taking their pd
 
05:30:02.708 --> 05:30:02.718 align:start position:0%
they get unwanted prism they're going to
 
05:30:05.750 --> 05:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
either see double have headache um and
 
05:30:07.590 --> 05:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
what about a progressive lens where
 
05:30:09.270 --> 05:30:09.280 align:start position:0%
progressive lens wear usually has a
 
05:30:10.830 --> 05:30:10.840 align:start position:0%
monocular pd
 
05:30:13.270 --> 05:30:13.280 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure many people in this room
 
05:30:15.830 --> 05:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
wear a progressive lens and i'm sure are
 
05:30:18.070 --> 05:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
not on their first pair of progressive
 
05:30:18.080 --> 05:30:18.948 align:start position:0%
not on their first pair of progressive
lens

05:30:18.948 --> 05:30:18.958 align:start position:0%
lens
 
05:30:18.958 --> 05:30:19.670 align:start position:0%
lens
so

05:30:19.670 --> 05:30:19.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:30:21.270 --> 05:30:21.280 align:start position:0%
i'm sure many people in this room are
 
05:30:23.910 --> 05:30:23.920 align:start position:0%
familiar with you know problems as a
 
05:30:26.310 --> 05:30:26.320 align:start position:0%
first time where the seg height the the
 
05:30:29.190 --> 05:30:29.200 align:start position:0%
pd and you know sometimes monocular or
 
05:30:31.670 --> 05:30:31.680 align:start position:0%
let's say if you um had a nose injury
 
05:30:32.948 --> 05:30:32.958 align:start position:0%
earlier in life
 
05:30:35.430 --> 05:30:35.440 align:start position:0%
and and you have a monocular pd
 
05:30:37.110 --> 05:30:37.120 align:start position:0%
so if you've got people that have to
 
05:30:40.788 --> 05:30:40.798 align:start position:0%
resort to do it yourself on the pd
 
05:30:43.190 --> 05:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
that that that creates error and which
 
05:30:43.200 --> 05:30:44.230 align:start position:0%
that that that creates error and which
which

05:30:44.230 --> 05:30:44.240 align:start position:0%
which
 
05:30:46.390 --> 05:30:46.400 align:start position:0%
leads to customer dissatisfaction and
 
05:30:47.750 --> 05:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
now you're dealing with you know
 
05:30:50.150 --> 05:30:50.160 align:start position:0%
pursuing a refund or having to uh
 
05:30:51.350 --> 05:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
replace it
 
05:30:53.350 --> 05:30:53.360 align:start position:0%
so i i definitely support this bill i
 
05:30:55.110 --> 05:30:55.120 align:start position:0%
could go on and on and on and i'd be
 
05:31:01.510 --> 05:31:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:03.670 --> 05:31:03.680 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you and see you in the
 
05:31:06.868 --> 05:31:06.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:09.430 --> 05:31:09.440 align:start position:0%
and the last card i have and is from
 
05:31:13.270 --> 05:31:13.280 align:start position:0%

05:34:31.030 --> 05:34:31.040 align:start position:0%
complaint to me about filling a contact
 
05:34:32.948 --> 05:34:32.958 align:start position:0%
lens prescription
 
05:34:35.990 --> 05:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
i searched through the hundreds of lsr
 
05:34:39.030 --> 05:34:39.040 align:start position:0%
titles and lucky me i found one that was
 
05:34:41.030 --> 05:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
germane to his concern
 
05:34:42.548 --> 05:34:42.558 align:start position:0%
representative value's bill on
 
05:34:45.190 --> 05:34:45.200 align:start position:0%
ophthalmic prescription requirements
 
05:34:47.590 --> 05:34:47.600 align:start position:0%
so i come to you today with an amendment
 
05:34:50.230 --> 05:34:50.240 align:start position:0%
to hb 1139
 
05:34:52.628 --> 05:34:52.638 align:start position:0%
to strengthen consumer opportunities for
 
05:34:55.910 --> 05:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
not just eyeglass wears but also for
 
05:34:58.470 --> 05:34:58.480 align:start position:0%
contact lens wearers as well
 
05:35:03.990 --> 05:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
as background per rsa 327 colon 25a

additionally a statement prohibiting

prescriber's professional discretion
 
05:35:35.830 --> 05:35:35.840 align:start position:0%
but anything on the prescription must be

honored in filling that prescription
 
05:35:40.230 --> 05:35:40.240 align:start position:0%
the eye care center that provided my
 
05:35:42.070 --> 05:35:42.080 align:start position:0%
constituent his eye exam and
 
05:35:45.190 --> 05:35:45.200 align:start position:0%
prescription also sells contact lenses
 
05:35:47.750 --> 05:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
under their own private label
 
05:35:50.070 --> 05:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
under current new hampshire law when
 
05:35:52.470 --> 05:35:52.480 align:start position:0%
they list private label on the contact
 
05:35:54.788 --> 05:35:54.798 align:start position:0%
lens prescription the prescription can
 
05:35:57.110 --> 05:35:57.120 align:start position:0%
only be filled for the private label
 
05:36:00.628 --> 05:36:00.638 align:start position:0%
lens no substitutions are allowed unless
 
05:36:03.110 --> 05:36:03.120 align:start position:0%
the manufacturer's own brand is included
 
05:36:05.430 --> 05:36:05.440 align:start position:0%
and substitutions are allowed
 
05:36:07.590 --> 05:36:07.600 align:start position:0%
this forced my constituent to purchase
 
05:36:10.230 --> 05:36:10.240 align:start position:0%
the contacts from the eye care center at
 
05:36:12.150 --> 05:36:12.160 align:start position:0%
a much higher cost than he could get for
 
05:36:15.590 --> 05:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
identical contacts from other sellers
 
05:36:17.910 --> 05:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
being forced to fill a contact lens
 
05:36:20.230 --> 05:36:20.240 align:start position:0%
prescription when the prescriber for a
 
05:36:22.150 --> 05:36:22.160 align:start position:0%
private label product
 
05:36:23.270 --> 05:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
for a
 
05:36:25.110 --> 05:36:25.120 align:start position:0%
private label product
 
05:36:27.510 --> 05:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
when identical lenses are available in
 
05:36:29.350 --> 05:36:29.360 align:start position:0%
the open market is not fair to the
 
05:36:29.360 --> 05:36:30.708 align:start position:0%
the open market is not fair to the
consumer

05:36:30.708 --> 05:36:30.718 align:start position:0%
consumer
 
05:36:32.310 --> 05:36:32.320 align:start position:0%
in fact and you'll see this on the
 
05:36:34.628 --> 05:36:34.638 align:start position:0%
handout i gave you of the updated rules
 
05:36:37.430 --> 05:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
from the federal trade commission
 
05:36:39.990 --> 05:36:40.000 align:start position:0%
in uh that they announced on june 23
 
05:36:43.270 --> 05:36:43.280 align:start position:0%
2020 the quote the final rule also
 
05:36:45.510 --> 05:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
clarifies that the only permissible
 
05:36:45.520 --> 05:36:46.868 align:start position:0%
clarifies that the only permissible
substitution

05:36:46.868 --> 05:36:46.878 align:start position:0%
substitution
 
05:36:49.510 --> 05:36:49.520 align:start position:0%
involves private label lenses
 
05:36:52.150 --> 05:36:52.160 align:start position:0%
private label and brand name
 
05:36:55.590 --> 05:36:55.600 align:start position:0%
lenses can be substituted for each other
 
05:36:57.510 --> 05:36:57.520 align:start position:0%
when they are identical lenses made by
 
05:36:59.830 --> 05:36:59.840 align:start position:0%
the same manufacturer
 
05:36:59.840 --> 05:37:00.788 align:start position:0%
the same manufacturer
so

05:37:00.788 --> 05:37:00.798 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:37:02.948 --> 05:37:02.958 align:start position:0%
therefore i offer this amendment
 
05:37:06.390 --> 05:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
amendment 0133h
 
05:37:10.948 --> 05:37:10.958 align:start position:0%

roman numeral five
 
05:37:15.030 --> 05:37:15.040 align:start position:0%
which makes three changes
 
05:37:17.590 --> 05:37:17.600 align:start position:0%
includes the manufacturer's brand name
 
05:37:19.510 --> 05:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
to the prescription
 
05:37:22.310 --> 05:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
prescribers can forbid substitutions
 
05:37:25.350 --> 05:37:25.360 align:start position:0%
only for health reasons
 
05:37:27.510 --> 05:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
and include the statement found in the
 
05:37:31.430 --> 05:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
ftc contact lens final rule
 
05:37:33.430 --> 05:37:33.440 align:start position:0%
which is on the opposite page of the
 
05:37:34.788 --> 05:37:34.798 align:start position:0%
press release
 
05:37:37.270 --> 05:37:37.280 align:start position:0%
quote private label and brand name
 
05:37:40.390 --> 05:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
lenses can be substituted for each other
 
05:37:42.628 --> 05:37:42.638 align:start position:0%
when they are identical lenses made by
 
05:37:45.670 --> 05:37:45.680 align:start position:0%
the same manufacturer end quote
 
05:37:47.190 --> 05:37:47.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time and i'll be
 
05:37:51.670 --> 05:37:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:54.548 --> 05:37:54.558 align:start position:0%
representative merchant
 
05:37:56.628 --> 05:37:56.638 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and also thank you
 
05:37:58.230 --> 05:37:58.240 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
05:37:59.750 --> 05:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
my background is in pharmacy i'm a
 
05:38:02.070 --> 05:38:02.080 align:start position:0%
pharmacist and when we look at generic
 
05:38:02.080 --> 05:38:03.430 align:start position:0%
pharmacist and when we look at generic
products

05:38:03.430 --> 05:38:03.440 align:start position:0%
products
 
05:38:05.750 --> 05:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
the fda controls the production of the
 
05:38:07.590 --> 05:38:07.600 align:start position:0%
generics so therefore one generic is
 
05:38:08.788 --> 05:38:08.798 align:start position:0%
basically comfortable with another
 
05:38:08.798 --> 05:38:09.830 align:start position:0%
basically comfortable with another
generic

05:38:09.830 --> 05:38:09.840 align:start position:0%
generic
 
05:38:11.270 --> 05:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
brand name
 
05:38:13.430 --> 05:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
help me understand why does the contact
 
05:38:14.948 --> 05:38:14.958 align:start position:0%
lens have to be made by the same
 
05:38:17.190 --> 05:38:17.200 align:start position:0%
manufacturer when another manufacturer
 
05:38:18.948 --> 05:38:18.958 align:start position:0%
could actually make the contact lens
 
05:38:22.150 --> 05:38:22.160 align:start position:0%
comparable to the other one
 
05:38:25.190 --> 05:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
um i couldn't get all your question but
 
05:38:28.628 --> 05:38:28.638 align:start position:0%
the uh in fact i have my contact lens
 
05:38:31.030 --> 05:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
prescription right here
 
05:38:33.190 --> 05:38:33.200 align:start position:0%
and it has
 
05:38:35.190 --> 05:38:35.200 align:start position:0%
air optics night day
 
05:38:38.310 --> 05:38:38.320 align:start position:0%
so if i went to an eye care center they
 
05:38:40.708 --> 05:38:40.718 align:start position:0%
might re-brand this the exact same
 
05:38:42.948 --> 05:38:42.958 align:start position:0%
contact lens under
 
05:38:46.788 --> 05:38:46.798 align:start position:0%
um merrimack ice center contact lens day
 
05:38:46.798 --> 05:38:47.910 align:start position:0%
um merrimack ice center contact lens day
night

05:38:47.910 --> 05:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
night
 
05:38:49.990 --> 05:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
even though it's exactly the identical
 
05:38:50.000 --> 05:38:50.948 align:start position:0%
even though it's exactly the identical
lens

05:38:50.948 --> 05:38:50.958 align:start position:0%
lens
 
05:38:50.958 --> 05:38:51.750 align:start position:0%
lens
so

05:38:51.750 --> 05:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:38:54.150 --> 05:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
what my amendment would do is to allow
 
05:38:55.750 --> 05:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
those substitutions if they're an
 
05:38:55.760 --> 05:38:57.430 align:start position:0%
those substitutions if they're an
identical

05:38:57.430 --> 05:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
identical
 
05:39:00.150 --> 05:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
lens made by the same manufacturer
 
05:39:00.160 --> 05:39:02.868 align:start position:0%
lens made by the same manufacturer
follow-up

05:39:02.868 --> 05:39:02.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:06.470 --> 05:39:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:07.590 --> 05:39:07.600 align:start position:0%
why does a
 
05:39:09.190 --> 05:39:09.200 align:start position:0%
lens have to be made by the same
 
05:39:12.310 --> 05:39:12.320 align:start position:0%
manufacturer in the world of drugs
 
05:39:15.430 --> 05:39:15.440 align:start position:0%
if the manufacturer makes a generic drug
 
05:39:17.830 --> 05:39:17.840 align:start position:0%
comparable to any other drug it meets
 
05:39:19.590 --> 05:39:19.600 align:start position:0%
all the specifications
 
05:39:21.110 --> 05:39:21.120 align:start position:0%
the pharmacist can use that generic
 
05:39:23.430 --> 05:39:23.440 align:start position:0%
regardless of the manufacturer why does
 
05:39:26.070 --> 05:39:26.080 align:start position:0%
a contact lens have to be come from the
 
05:39:28.310 --> 05:39:28.320 align:start position:0%
same manufacturer as long as the specs
 
05:39:30.310 --> 05:39:30.320 align:start position:0%
on that contact lens
 
05:39:32.230 --> 05:39:32.240 align:start position:0%
satisfy the requirements of the eye
 
05:39:32.240 --> 05:39:33.830 align:start position:0%
satisfy the requirements of the eye

05:39:33.830 --> 05:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
doctor
 
05:39:35.510 --> 05:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
i understand your question now thank you
 
05:39:38.788 --> 05:39:38.798 align:start position:0%
for it um i i think i'm open to that the
 
05:39:41.270 --> 05:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
only thing is there's just so many
 
05:39:43.350 --> 05:39:43.360 align:start position:0%
contact lens manufacturers and they are
 
05:39:46.628 --> 05:39:46.638 align:start position:0%
very highly regulated and inspected um
 
05:39:48.868 --> 05:39:48.878 align:start position:0%
and but many of them offer private label
 
05:39:48.878 --> 05:39:50.070 align:start position:0%
and but many of them offer private label
contacts

05:39:50.070 --> 05:39:50.080 align:start position:0%
contacts
 
05:39:52.390 --> 05:39:52.400 align:start position:0%
so it's it
 
05:39:54.230 --> 05:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
i and that you know i think i would
 
05:39:56.150 --> 05:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
rather err on the side of caution about
 
05:39:57.910 --> 05:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
using an identical
 
05:40:01.270 --> 05:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
um an identical lens because
 
05:40:03.590 --> 05:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
um it is having contact with the eye
 
05:40:03.600 --> 05:40:04.548 align:start position:0%
um it is having contact with the eye
tissue

05:40:04.548 --> 05:40:04.558 align:start position:0%
tissue
 
05:40:05.910 --> 05:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
and it's
 
05:40:07.910 --> 05:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
not as there's
 
05:40:07.920 --> 05:40:09.270 align:start position:0%
not as there's
medical

05:40:09.270 --> 05:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
medical
 
05:40:11.990 --> 05:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh consequences sometimes of using a
 
05:40:14.310 --> 05:40:14.320 align:start position:0%
contact lens that's different from the
 
05:40:15.910 --> 05:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
one that was prescribed even though it
 
05:40:17.750 --> 05:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
may appear to be the same
 
05:40:19.190 --> 05:40:19.200 align:start position:0%
it could be there could have been some
 
05:40:21.430 --> 05:40:21.440 align:start position:0%
material that's used in the manufacture
 
05:40:22.628 --> 05:40:22.638 align:start position:0%
of the
 
05:40:24.628 --> 05:40:24.638 align:start position:0%
brand two contact
 
05:40:26.948 --> 05:40:26.958 align:start position:0%
which may not be consistent with the
 
05:40:29.990 --> 05:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
person's body or maybe allergic reaction
 
05:40:31.990 --> 05:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
or something like that but
 
05:40:32.000 --> 05:40:32.948 align:start position:0%
or something like that but
um

05:40:32.948 --> 05:40:32.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:40:35.510 --> 05:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
any any contact lens
 
05:40:37.830 --> 05:40:37.840 align:start position:0%
can be put on the prescription it it
 
05:40:37.840 --> 05:40:39.590 align:start position:0%
can be put on the prescription it it
doesn't

05:40:39.590 --> 05:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
05:40:41.590 --> 05:40:41.600 align:start position:0%
what's the limiting factor is when they
 
05:40:44.070 --> 05:40:44.080 align:start position:0%
don't specify the manufacturer of the
 
05:40:46.470 --> 05:40:46.480 align:start position:0%
private label lens
 
05:40:48.548 --> 05:40:48.558 align:start position:0%
and or they have the statement no
 
05:40:51.430 --> 05:40:51.440 align:start position:0%
substitutions are allowed that's why in
 
05:40:51.440 --> 05:40:53.270 align:start position:0%
substitutions are allowed that's why in
my

05:40:53.270 --> 05:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
my
 
05:40:54.548 --> 05:40:54.558 align:start position:0%
the other change i made in that
 
05:40:56.470 --> 05:40:56.480 align:start position:0%
amendment the second one
 
05:40:56.480 --> 05:40:57.670 align:start position:0%
amendment the second one
only

05:40:57.670 --> 05:40:57.680 align:start position:0%
only
 
05:41:00.150 --> 05:41:00.160 align:start position:0%
it limits prescribers
 
05:41:03.590 --> 05:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
that they can only um
 
05:41:05.510 --> 05:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
require substitutions if there's a
 
05:41:07.030 --> 05:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
health reason
 
05:41:09.110 --> 05:41:09.120 align:start position:0%
so there's a statement there that says
 
05:41:09.120 --> 05:41:09.990 align:start position:0%
so there's a statement there that says
uh

05:41:09.990 --> 05:41:10.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:41:11.430 --> 05:41:11.440 align:start position:0%
included that the prescriber's
 
05:41:13.110 --> 05:41:13.120 align:start position:0%
professional discretion for health
 
05:41:14.548 --> 05:41:14.558 align:start position:0%
reasons only
 
05:41:17.350 --> 05:41:17.360 align:start position:0%
so they can't demand a sub uh or forbid
 
05:41:20.548 --> 05:41:20.558 align:start position:0%
a substitution let's say for a business
 
05:41:20.558 --> 05:41:21.590 align:start position:0%
a substitution let's say for a business
reason

05:41:21.590 --> 05:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
reason
 
05:41:24.788 --> 05:41:24.798 align:start position:0%
um only requiring them to buy a brand
 
05:41:24.798 --> 05:41:25.670 align:start position:0%
um only requiring them to buy a brand
that

05:41:25.670 --> 05:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:41:29.910 --> 05:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:32.948 --> 05:41:32.958 align:start position:0%
i hope they answer your question
 
05:41:34.788 --> 05:41:34.798 align:start position:0%
representative leon
 
05:41:36.628 --> 05:41:36.638 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
05:41:38.948 --> 05:41:38.958 align:start position:0%
taking the question would you believe
 
05:41:40.628 --> 05:41:40.638 align:start position:0%
that when i was an analyst covering
 
05:41:43.110 --> 05:41:43.120 align:start position:0%
johnson johnson i was involved with both
 
05:41:45.590 --> 05:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
drug approvals and contact lens
 
05:41:48.310 --> 05:41:48.320 align:start position:0%
approvals and the process for
 
05:41:48.320 --> 05:41:49.110 align:start position:0%
approvals and the process for
for

05:41:49.110 --> 05:41:49.120 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:41:51.590 --> 05:41:51.600 align:start position:0%
devices in general and including contact
 
05:41:51.600 --> 05:41:52.390 align:start position:0%
devices in general and including contact
lenses

05:41:52.390 --> 05:41:52.400 align:start position:0%
lenses
 
05:41:54.628 --> 05:41:54.638 align:start position:0%
is very different and each of those has
 
05:41:56.470 --> 05:41:56.480 align:start position:0%
a very specific approval where they're
 
05:41:59.590 --> 05:41:59.600 align:start position:0%
not easily transferable one for one so
 
05:42:01.270 --> 05:42:01.280 align:start position:0%
it's not actually a good one for one
 
05:42:03.510 --> 05:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
comparison to the generic market but the
 
05:42:06.230 --> 05:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
private label is thank you for that that
 
05:42:07.910 --> 05:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
is a very good clarification and one
 
05:42:09.910 --> 05:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
that's very necessary so thank you for
 
05:42:11.270 --> 05:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
this amendment well thank you i
 
05:42:12.390 --> 05:42:12.400 align:start position:0%
appreciate it
 
05:42:12.400 --> 05:42:15.190 align:start position:0%
appreciate it
representative

05:42:15.190 --> 05:42:15.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:42:16.390 --> 05:42:16.400 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for taking my
 
05:42:18.150 --> 05:42:18.160 align:start position:0%
question i just have a question
 
05:42:20.548 --> 05:42:20.558 align:start position:0%
if we have an ftc rule
 
05:42:22.310 --> 05:42:22.320 align:start position:0%
do we need to put it in statute in the
 
05:42:24.788 --> 05:42:24.798 align:start position:0%
state or does the ftc rules already
 
05:42:26.868 --> 05:42:26.878 align:start position:0%
supersede or already guide what we have
 
05:42:28.230 --> 05:42:28.240 align:start position:0%
to do
 
05:42:30.788 --> 05:42:30.798 align:start position:0%
i i was going to provide thank you for
 
05:42:32.948 --> 05:42:32.958 align:start position:0%
that question dr knark i was going to
 
05:42:34.948 --> 05:42:34.958 align:start position:0%
provide the ftc rule but i would have
 
05:42:36.470 --> 05:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
had to cut down a forest to give
 
05:42:37.990 --> 05:42:38.000 align:start position:0%
everyone a copy
 
05:42:38.000 --> 05:42:38.948 align:start position:0%
everyone a copy
um

05:42:38.948 --> 05:42:38.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:42:40.948 --> 05:42:40.958 align:start position:0%
but when i was reading through the
 
05:42:42.868 --> 05:42:42.878 align:start position:0%
contact lens rule
 
05:42:45.430 --> 05:42:45.440 align:start position:0%
many many times and even particularly
 
05:42:49.670 --> 05:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
with expiration date it's um they defer
 
05:42:51.030 --> 05:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
to the state law
 
05:42:54.390 --> 05:42:54.400 align:start position:0%
so it's it's it's not a really a strong
 
05:42:56.470 --> 05:42:56.480 align:start position:0%
uh compelling requirement when it's in
 
05:42:58.070 --> 05:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
their rule
 
05:42:59.910 --> 05:42:59.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:43:01.510 --> 05:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
any further questions for the
 
05:43:01.520 --> 05:43:05.270 align:start position:0%
any further questions for the
representative

05:43:05.270 --> 05:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:07.430 --> 05:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much thank you and
 
05:43:08.788 --> 05:43:08.798 align:start position:0%
just point out to the committee
 
05:43:11.350 --> 05:43:11.360 align:start position:0%
especially those in your first term when
 
05:43:13.190 --> 05:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
there's multiple amendments and we
 
05:43:15.430 --> 05:43:15.440 align:start position:0%
already have two
 
05:43:17.830 --> 05:43:17.840 align:start position:0%
be careful how they're crafted
 
05:43:20.230 --> 05:43:20.240 align:start position:0%
because if you have an amendment
 
05:43:23.510 --> 05:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
that says replace the bill with
 
05:43:25.190 --> 05:43:25.200 align:start position:0%
and then there's another amendment that
 
05:43:27.510 --> 05:43:27.520 align:start position:0%
says replace the bill with
 
05:43:29.350 --> 05:43:29.360 align:start position:0%
the one you do first is going to die
 
05:43:31.030 --> 05:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
it's going to be replaced by the second
 
05:43:31.040 --> 05:43:32.230 align:start position:0%
it's going to be replaced by the second
one

05:43:32.230 --> 05:43:32.240 align:start position:0%
one
 
05:43:32.240 --> 05:43:32.948 align:start position:0%
one
but

05:43:32.948 --> 05:43:32.958 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:43:34.868 --> 05:43:34.878 align:start position:0%
the two amendments we have here
 
05:43:38.948 --> 05:43:38.958 align:start position:0%
representative runs is insert this
 
05:43:41.670 --> 05:43:41.680 align:start position:0%
between and representative villier is
 
05:43:45.750 --> 05:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
replace that so they don't clash but if
 
05:43:47.590 --> 05:43:47.600 align:start position:0%
you're thinking of bringing an amendment
 
05:43:49.990 --> 05:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
to this bill just make sure that
 
05:43:52.470 --> 05:43:52.480 align:start position:0%
that initial wording doesn't have
 
05:43:55.430 --> 05:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences
 
05:44:00.470 --> 05:44:00.480 align:start position:0%
with that close the hearing on 11 39 and
 
05:44:00.480 --> 05:44:01.350 align:start position:0%
with that close the hearing on 11 39 and
uh

05:44:01.350 --> 05:44:01.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:44:03.110 --> 05:44:03.120 align:start position:0%
i'd like to take a breath
 
05:44:05.350 --> 05:44:05.360 align:start position:0%
for about five minutes
 
05:44:07.190 --> 05:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
my clerk would like to take a breath for
 
05:44:10.708 --> 05:44:10.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:13.270 --> 05:44:13.280 align:start position:0%
so we got five minutes we'll be back and
 
05:44:15.110 --> 05:44:15.120 align:start position:0%
move on this one ought to go quick i
 
05:44:16.628 --> 05:44:16.638 align:start position:0%
don't see anything
 
05:44:22.150 --> 05:44:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:32.150 --> 05:44:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:33.270 --> 05:44:33.280 align:start position:0%
uh no
 
05:44:36.230 --> 05:44:36.240 align:start position:0%
no these are leftovers in case
 
05:44:37.830 --> 05:44:37.840 align:start position:0%
somebody's missing one i'm putting them
 
05:44:39.830 --> 05:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
all out there no i mean these oh no
 
05:44:41.590 --> 05:44:41.600 align:start position:0%
those are the past ones no i made
 
05:44:43.430 --> 05:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
dumplings all numbered so i know which
 
05:44:45.190 --> 05:44:45.200 align:start position:0%
bill they go to and they're numbered i
 
05:44:46.788 --> 05:44:46.798 align:start position:0%
may dump a few builds until there's
 
05:44:48.868 --> 05:44:48.878 align:start position:0%
sheets here
 
05:45:04.548 --> 05:45:04.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:07.590 --> 05:45:07.600 align:start position:0%
it has i tell ya
 
05:45:09.590 --> 05:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
there have been
 
05:45:13.750 --> 05:45:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:15.670 --> 05:45:15.680 align:start position:0%
and it's hard to pass out amen our
 
05:45:18.150 --> 05:45:18.160 align:start position:0%
handouts and take notes at the same time
 
05:45:20.470 --> 05:45:20.480 align:start position:0%
i just thought i'd let you know that
 
05:45:30.190 --> 05:45:30.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:33.110 --> 05:45:33.120 align:start position:0%
1466 was heard on a different day i
 
05:45:33.120 --> 05:45:34.150 align:start position:0%
1466 was heard on a different day i
guess

05:45:34.150 --> 05:45:34.160 align:start position:0%
guess
 
05:45:38.670 --> 05:45:38.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:38.680 --> 05:46:00.868 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

05:46:00.868 --> 05:46:00.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:02.548 --> 05:46:02.558 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to make sure i have two
 
05:46:03.910 --> 05:46:03.920 align:start position:0%
copies of everything and some things
 
05:46:05.670 --> 05:46:05.680 align:start position:0%
people just handed me one copy and i
 
05:46:07.590 --> 05:46:07.600 align:start position:0%
don't even have the copies for everyone
 
05:46:09.190 --> 05:46:09.200 align:start position:0%
else yet
 
05:46:11.670 --> 05:46:11.680 align:start position:0%
so some of them were sent by email
 
05:46:13.590 --> 05:46:13.600 align:start position:0%
i sent mine in my email but i have
 
05:46:15.510 --> 05:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
another copy there okay
 
05:46:19.590 --> 05:46:19.600 align:start position:0%
okay okay so this was i see yes and i
 
05:46:22.230 --> 05:46:22.240 align:start position:0%
think someone already made those
 
05:46:22.240 --> 05:46:23.510 align:start position:0%
think someone already made those
perfect

05:46:23.510 --> 05:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
perfect
 
05:46:25.030 --> 05:46:25.040 align:start position:0%
this is good
 
05:46:44.788 --> 05:46:44.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:49.110 --> 05:46:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:51.110 --> 05:46:51.120 align:start position:0%

extras here
 
05:46:54.868 --> 05:46:54.878 align:start position:0%

medication
 
06:04:32.150 --> 06:04:32.160 align:start position:0%
there have been efforts to categorize
 
06:04:33.910 --> 06:04:33.920 align:start position:0%
this off-label treatment and other
 
06:04:35.910 --> 06:04:35.920 align:start position:0%
repurposed drugs as dangerous and not
 
06:04:35.920 --> 06:04:37.030 align:start position:0%
repurposed drugs as dangerous and not
recommended

06:04:37.030 --> 06:04:37.040 align:start position:0%
recommended
 
06:04:38.708 --> 06:04:38.718 align:start position:0%
although the bureaucratic organizations

of government and professional
 
06:04:42.390 --> 06:04:42.400 align:start position:0%
authorities rage against it ask doctors
 
06:04:44.708 --> 06:04:44.718 align:start position:0%
and nurses what they think and many have
 
06:04:47.110 --> 06:04:47.120 align:start position:0%
a different professional opinion
 
06:04:48.310 --> 06:04:48.320 align:start position:0%
they've looked at the evidence and they
 
06:04:51.110 --> 06:04:51.120 align:start position:0%
see the opportunity to help people
 
06:04:53.190 --> 06:04:53.200 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the campaign to demonize
 
06:04:55.510 --> 06:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
this out-of-patent drug is dangerous as
 
06:04:57.670 --> 06:04:57.680 align:start position:0%
dangerous horse paste has had a chilling

willingness to utilize it
 
06:05:03.430 --> 06:05:03.440 align:start position:0%
most doctors work for large hospital
 
06:05:05.190 --> 06:05:05.200 align:start position:0%
systems which have policies that forbid
 
06:05:07.030 --> 06:05:07.040 align:start position:0%
treating with ivermectin and so they
 
06:05:09.750 --> 06:05:09.760 align:start position:0%
can't prescribe it even if they want to
 
06:05:11.350 --> 06:05:11.360 align:start position:0%
how far the practice of medicine has
 
06:05:13.190 --> 06:05:13.200 align:start position:0%
fallen when doctors cannot use their
 
06:05:15.590 --> 06:05:15.600 align:start position:0%
knowledge of medications and physiology
 
06:05:18.310 --> 06:05:18.320 align:start position:0%

percent of prescriptions given are for
 
06:05:24.150 --> 06:05:24.160 align:start position:0%
off-label use
 
06:05:25.830 --> 06:05:25.840 align:start position:0%
these same hospital systems strongly
 
06:05:27.670 --> 06:05:27.680 align:start position:0%
advocate for vaccination with vaccines
 
06:05:29.190 --> 06:05:29.200 align:start position:0%
that have the highest number of reported

has not been studied long term and

been used safely for decades and has
 
06:06:05.110 --> 06:06:05.120 align:start position:0%
more than 10 documented mechanisms of

to make people very sick
 
06:06:11.430 --> 06:06:11.440 align:start position:0%
the hospitals advocate that people stay
 
06:06:12.948 --> 06:06:12.958 align:start position:0%
home until they have complications such

bring the hospital system close to

06:06:31.510 --> 06:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
if there is a safe drug available that
 
06:06:32.868 --> 06:06:32.878 align:start position:0%
could help reduce the burden on the
 
06:06:35.030 --> 06:06:35.040 align:start position:0%
hospital systems and save lives why
 
06:06:36.390 --> 06:06:36.400 align:start position:0%
would the hospitals and professional
 
06:06:38.470 --> 06:06:38.480 align:start position:0%
organizations rally against
 
06:06:40.788 --> 06:06:40.798 align:start position:0%
this drug like no other off-label drug
 
06:06:42.230 --> 06:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
in history
 
06:06:44.548 --> 06:06:44.558 align:start position:0%
ivermectin is inexpensive it can be
 
06:06:46.230 --> 06:06:46.240 align:start position:0%
compounded locally
 
06:06:48.070 --> 06:06:48.080 align:start position:0%
it's been out of patent for years and is
 
06:06:49.910 --> 06:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
not a money-making drug it's
 
06:06:51.670 --> 06:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
demonstrably safe and increasingly
 
06:06:54.390 --> 06:06:54.400 align:start position:0%

already used meta-analyses to combine
 
06:07:13.510 --> 06:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
smaller studies and make sense of their

data as a whole and multiple
 
06:07:16.708 --> 06:07:16.718 align:start position:0%

effects from ivermectin
 
06:07:20.948 --> 06:07:20.958 align:start position:0%
standing orders are specific and can be
 
06:07:23.590 --> 06:07:23.600 align:start position:0%
written essentially in algorithm form
 
06:07:25.350 --> 06:07:25.360 align:start position:0%
with dosage instructions based on
 
06:07:27.270 --> 06:07:27.280 align:start position:0%
patient weight and indication

whether for prophylaxis or treatment
 
06:07:31.270 --> 06:07:31.280 align:start position:0%

frontline critical care providers who

corporate pharmacies and hospital
 
06:07:48.150 --> 06:07:48.160 align:start position:0%
pharmacies will be willing to take
 
06:07:50.470 --> 06:07:50.480 align:start position:0%
standing orders for ivermectin but some

standing orders for ivermectin but some
will

06:07:51.350 --> 06:07:51.360 align:start position:0%
will
 
06:07:53.030 --> 06:07:53.040 align:start position:0%
not all doctors will be willing to risk
 
06:07:54.948 --> 06:07:54.958 align:start position:0%
persecution and potential disciplinary

action for writing a standing order but
 
06:07:59.030 --> 06:07:59.040 align:start position:0%
some brave souls will
 
06:08:00.948 --> 06:08:00.958 align:start position:0%
even if one pharmacy receives a standing

order from one physician in new
 
06:08:04.310 --> 06:08:04.320 align:start position:0%
hampshire it would be better than none
 
06:08:05.830 --> 06:08:05.840 align:start position:0%
it could greatly reduce suffering the
 
06:08:07.510 --> 06:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
burden on hospitals and it could save
 
06:08:09.350 --> 06:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
lives i hope you will listen to the
 
06:08:11.190 --> 06:08:11.200 align:start position:0%
testimony here today with an open mind
 
06:08:13.270 --> 06:08:13.280 align:start position:0%
and heart and give people access to an
 
06:08:15.350 --> 06:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
option for early treatment for coven 19.
 
06:08:16.628 --> 06:08:16.638 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:08:18.868 --> 06:08:18.878 align:start position:0%
would the representative take questions
 
06:08:18.878 --> 06:08:27.110 align:start position:0%
would the representative take questions
yes

06:08:27.110 --> 06:08:27.120 align:start position:0%

06:08:34.708 --> 06:08:34.718 align:start position:0%
now i'm going to call on a proponent
 
06:08:36.708 --> 06:08:36.718 align:start position:0%
and an opponent
 
06:08:38.470 --> 06:08:38.480 align:start position:0%
and give you
 
06:08:40.788 --> 06:08:40.798 align:start position:0%
more latitude say seven to eight minutes
 
06:08:44.548 --> 06:08:44.558 align:start position:0%
each to present the case then we will
 
06:08:47.430 --> 06:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
start working on the stack of pink cards
 
06:08:50.310 --> 06:08:50.320 align:start position:0%
the chair calls paul morick i hope i
 
06:08:53.270 --> 06:08:53.280 align:start position:0%
have that right from norfolk virginia
 
06:08:58.230 --> 06:08:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:00.470 --> 06:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and the committee
 
06:09:03.430 --> 06:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
so you were right uh chairman that this
 
06:09:05.350 --> 06:09:05.360 align:start position:0%
is not controversial
 
06:09:07.670 --> 06:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
if you look at the science
 
06:09:09.590 --> 06:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
if you look at the science this is not a
 
06:09:11.510 --> 06:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
controversial issue it's been made
 
06:09:11.520 --> 06:09:12.948 align:start position:0%
controversial issue it's been made
controversial

06:09:12.948 --> 06:09:12.958 align:start position:0%
controversial
 
06:09:16.470 --> 06:09:16.480 align:start position:0%

after covert patients since march the
 
06:09:33.910 --> 06:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
24th last year i've looked after
 
06:09:37.270 --> 06:09:37.280 align:start position:0%
hundreds and hundreds of cobot patients
 
06:09:40.150 --> 06:09:40.160 align:start position:0%
i've published over 600 peer-reviewed
 
06:09:43.270 --> 06:09:43.280 align:start position:0%
papers and i'm the second most published
 
06:09:46.390 --> 06:09:46.400 align:start position:0%
person in my specialty ever so i think i
 
06:09:49.350 --> 06:09:49.360 align:start position:0%
do have some credibility so i will talk
 
06:09:51.430 --> 06:09:51.440 align:start position:0%
about ivamectin but i'm prepared to
 
06:09:54.548 --> 06:09:54.558 align:start position:0%
answer any question on covert or any
 
06:09:56.150 --> 06:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
related issue
 
06:09:58.788 --> 06:09:58.798 align:start position:0%
so as we heard excellent presentation
 
06:09:58.798 --> 06:10:00.628 align:start position:0%
so as we heard excellent presentation
after

06:10:00.628 --> 06:10:00.638 align:start position:0%
after
 
06:10:03.510 --> 06:10:03.520 align:start position:0%
penicillin this is the second most
 
06:10:06.470 --> 06:10:06.480 align:start position:0%

06:10:09.590 --> 06:10:09.600 align:start position:0%

awarded the nobel prize in 200 2015 for
 
06:10:28.310 --> 06:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
their 1975 discovery of ivamekton it's
 
06:10:30.470 --> 06:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
notable this is the only
 
06:10:30.480 --> 06:10:31.948 align:start position:0%
notable this is the only
pharmaceutical

06:10:31.948 --> 06:10:31.958 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical
 
06:10:35.110 --> 06:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
anti-infective drug ever to receive the
 
06:10:38.070 --> 06:10:38.080 align:start position:0%
nobel prize it was first used in humans
 
06:10:42.470 --> 06:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
in 1987. it is on the who's list of
 
06:10:44.868 --> 06:10:44.878 align:start position:0%
essential medicines it's an essential
 
06:10:49.430 --> 06:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
medicine according to the who 3.7
 
06:10:52.150 --> 06:10:52.160 align:start position:0%
billion doses have been dispensed to
 
06:10:52.160 --> 06:10:53.430 align:start position:0%
billion doses have been dispensed to
humans

06:10:53.430 --> 06:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
humans
 
06:10:56.070 --> 06:10:56.080 align:start position:0%
to human beings not horses
 
06:11:00.628 --> 06:11:00.638 align:start position:0%
3.7 billion doses have been dispensed to
 
06:11:03.990 --> 06:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
human beings this is a remarkable drug
 
06:11:07.190 --> 06:11:07.200 align:start position:0%
it has broad-spectrum anti-parasitic
 
06:11:09.110 --> 06:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
effective against a whole bunch of
 
06:11:11.990 --> 06:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
parasites and as we heard it's very
 
06:11:16.070 --> 06:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
effective against rna viruses hiv virus
 
06:11:21.510 --> 06:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
zika virus influenza virus source cov2
 
06:11:23.350 --> 06:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
in addition what makes this a truly
 
06:11:25.270 --> 06:11:25.280 align:start position:0%
astonishing drug and there's no other
 
06:11:28.510 --> 06:11:28.520 align:start position:0%
drug like it it is a potent
 
06:11:31.190 --> 06:11:31.200 align:start position:0%
anti-inflammatory drug and if anybody
 
06:11:33.670 --> 06:11:33.680 align:start position:0%
knows how about covert covert goes
 
06:11:37.350 --> 06:11:37.360 align:start position:0%
through stages a viral replicative phase
 
06:11:40.230 --> 06:11:40.240 align:start position:0%
to a profound inflammatory phase that's
 
06:11:42.788 --> 06:11:42.798 align:start position:0%
why ivamectin is unique in that it
 
06:11:46.390 --> 06:11:46.400 align:start position:0%
treats across the spectrum of size kovi
 
06:11:46.400 --> 06:11:47.190 align:start position:0%
treats across the spectrum of size kovi
2.

06:11:47.190 --> 06:11:47.200 align:start position:0%
2.
 
06:11:50.470 --> 06:11:50.480 align:start position:0%
it's safe and well tolerated the regular
 
06:11:53.110 --> 06:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
dose is 200 mics per kilo they've done
 
06:11:56.150 --> 06:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
dosing studies giving 10 times the
 
06:11:59.270 --> 06:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
recommended dose with minor side effects
 
06:12:03.270 --> 06:12:03.280 align:start position:0%
which include pureitis fever rash and
 
06:12:03.280 --> 06:12:05.750 align:start position:0%
which include pureitis fever rash and
arthralgia

06:12:05.750 --> 06:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
arthralgia
 
06:12:09.510 --> 06:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
the second page is from the nobel prize
 
06:12:12.548 --> 06:12:12.558 align:start position:0%
lecture of satoshi omuri you can see
 
06:12:15.830 --> 06:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
that 1.4 billion doses have been given
 
06:12:18.470 --> 06:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
for onco-psychiatrists this is river
 
06:12:21.270 --> 06:12:21.280 align:start position:0%
blindness this is a disabling disease in
 
06:12:21.280 --> 06:12:22.310 align:start position:0%
blindness this is a disabling disease in
africa

06:12:22.310 --> 06:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
africa
 
06:12:25.350 --> 06:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
ivamectin has changed the face of this
 
06:12:25.360 --> 06:12:26.350 align:start position:0%
ivamectin has changed the face of this
disease

06:12:26.350 --> 06:12:26.360 align:start position:0%
disease
 
06:12:29.590 --> 06:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
1.2 billion doses for lymphatic
 
06:12:29.600 --> 06:12:32.150 align:start position:0%
1.2 billion doses for lymphatic
filariasis

06:12:32.150 --> 06:12:32.160 align:start position:0%
filariasis
 
06:12:34.628 --> 06:12:34.638 align:start position:0%
so in terms of its mode of action as dr
 
06:12:37.350 --> 06:12:37.360 align:start position:0%
cushman said that she she did a really
 
06:12:40.470 --> 06:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
good job so either make acts on a number
 
06:12:43.110 --> 06:12:43.120 align:start position:0%
of different pathways to inhibit viral
 
06:12:46.548 --> 06:12:46.558 align:start position:0%
replication this is not theoretical this
 
06:12:48.868 --> 06:12:48.878 align:start position:0%
is shown in the lab and this is shown in
 
06:12:51.670 --> 06:12:51.680 align:start position:0%
patients a study done in israel a
 
06:12:54.070 --> 06:12:54.080 align:start position:0%
randomized placebo control study where
 
06:12:56.548 --> 06:12:56.558 align:start position:0%
they gave ivamectin not only did they
 
06:13:00.548 --> 06:13:00.558 align:start position:0%
look actually cultured the virus it
 
06:13:04.070 --> 06:13:04.080 align:start position:0%
kills the virus so any assumption that
 
06:13:09.830 --> 06:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:11.990 --> 06:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
so in terms of the studies this is one
 
06:13:15.910 --> 06:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
of the most studied drugs for covert as
 
06:13:20.948 --> 06:13:20.958 align:start position:0%
we see 71 trials with 50 000 patients 31
 
06:13:22.788 --> 06:13:22.798 align:start position:0%
of these are randomized controlled
 
06:13:25.430 --> 06:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
trials you'll see an 83 percent
 
06:13:28.948 --> 06:13:28.958 align:start position:0%
improvement in prophylaxis trials 66
 
06:13:31.670 --> 06:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
improvement in early trials 34
 
06:13:34.708 --> 06:13:34.718 align:start position:0%
improvement in late trials a 52
 
06:13:37.350 --> 06:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
reduction in mortality it reduces
 
06:13:40.948 --> 06:13:40.958 align:start position:0%
mortality by half so the critics will
 
06:13:43.830 --> 06:13:43.840 align:start position:0%
say these are done in um
 
06:13:45.910 --> 06:13:45.920 align:start position:0%
i won't use the bad word
 
06:13:49.110 --> 06:13:49.120 align:start position:0%
poor countries that can't do good trials
 
06:13:50.948 --> 06:13:50.958 align:start position:0%
that's xenophobic
 
06:13:54.070 --> 06:13:54.080 align:start position:0%
that's xenophobic these countries and
 
06:13:57.030 --> 06:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
these investigators are sincere and
 
06:13:59.750 --> 06:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
honest and not bribed by pharmaceutical
 
06:13:59.760 --> 06:14:01.670 align:start position:0%
honest and not bribed by pharmaceutical
companies

06:14:01.670 --> 06:14:01.680 align:start position:0%
companies
 
06:14:04.150 --> 06:14:04.160 align:start position:0%
then we have the fda we all know about
 
06:14:06.708 --> 06:14:06.718 align:start position:0%
this you're not a horse you're not a cow
 
06:14:09.110 --> 06:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
seriously you will stop it you should
 
06:14:11.830 --> 06:14:11.840 align:start position:0%
not use ivermectin to treat or prevent
 
06:14:14.470 --> 06:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
covet 19 using the drug ivamectin which
 
06:14:18.230 --> 06:14:18.240 align:start position:0%
can be dangerous and even lethal so that
 
06:14:21.910 --> 06:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
is an outright lie it's dishonest and
 
06:14:24.548 --> 06:14:24.558 align:start position:0%
it's an outrage as we'll see this is a
 
06:14:27.750 --> 06:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
highly effective drug and either mectin
 
06:14:31.190 --> 06:14:31.200 align:start position:0%
has never killed a single person it is
 
06:14:35.750 --> 06:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
one of the safest drugs on this planet
 
06:14:39.030 --> 06:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
so then we have the data from the cdc
 
06:14:42.310 --> 06:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
which are equally as dishonest a myth is
 
06:14:45.270 --> 06:14:45.280 align:start position:0%
born how the cdc the fda and media wove
 
06:14:48.070 --> 06:14:48.080 align:start position:0%
a web of either mectin lies that
 
06:14:51.030 --> 06:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
outlived the truth so in new mexico they
 
06:14:53.590 --> 06:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
claimed that ivamekton killed two people
 
06:14:55.270 --> 06:14:55.280 align:start position:0%
actually these two people
 
06:14:58.310 --> 06:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
died of covert and then in mississippi
 
06:15:00.788 --> 06:15:00.798 align:start position:0%
there was a call that
 
06:15:03.190 --> 06:15:03.200 align:start position:0%
either to poison centers that there had
 
06:15:05.910 --> 06:15:05.920 align:start position:0%
been an increase of 70 percent of calls
 
06:15:09.030 --> 06:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
to poison control centers that is a lie
 
06:15:10.868 --> 06:15:10.878 align:start position:0%
there were three calls
 
06:15:14.230 --> 06:15:14.240 align:start position:0%
three calls of alleged side effects
 
06:15:17.430 --> 06:15:17.440 align:start position:0%
involving two animal formulations so
 
06:15:20.230 --> 06:15:20.240 align:start position:0%
again the cdc and the fda are
 
06:15:22.628 --> 06:15:22.638 align:start position:0%
perpetuating falsehoods
 
06:15:25.990 --> 06:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
and lies to scare the american people
 
06:15:28.150 --> 06:15:28.160 align:start position:0%
what is really interesting is ivan
 
06:15:31.670 --> 06:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
mekden is safe in 79 countries in the
 
06:15:34.390 --> 06:15:34.400 align:start position:0%
world let me say that again it is
 
06:15:37.910 --> 06:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
approved in 79 countries so somehow
 
06:15:41.430 --> 06:15:41.440 align:start position:0%
japanese people indian people brazilian
 
06:15:44.150 --> 06:15:44.160 align:start position:0%
people can tolerate it safely but it's
 
06:15:46.948 --> 06:15:46.958 align:start position:0%
toxic in americans you have to be
 
06:15:46.958 --> 06:15:48.310 align:start position:0%
toxic in americans you have to be
kidding

06:15:48.310 --> 06:15:48.320 align:start position:0%
kidding
 
06:15:50.948 --> 06:15:50.958 align:start position:0%
let's look at the toxicity so this is
 
06:15:54.390 --> 06:15:54.400 align:start position:0%
from the who itself the world health
 
06:15:57.350 --> 06:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
organization this is their visual vigi
 
06:15:59.430 --> 06:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
access database which is an
 
06:16:02.868 --> 06:16:02.878 align:start position:0%
international drug monitoring database
 
06:16:05.430 --> 06:16:05.440 align:start position:0%
for the last 40 years
 
06:16:09.030 --> 06:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
if we see since 1992
 
06:16:11.430 --> 06:16:11.440 align:start position:0%
ivamectin is associated with so-called
 
06:16:15.110 --> 06:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
20 deaths and 5 000 adverse events we
 
06:16:17.510 --> 06:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
think all of these 20 deaths were due to
 
06:16:19.830 --> 06:16:19.840 align:start position:0%
an allergic reaction to the death of the
 
06:16:23.670 --> 06:16:23.680 align:start position:0%
parasite let's look at covert 19
 
06:16:27.990 --> 06:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
vaccines in one year 14 000 deaths
 
06:16:31.110 --> 06:16:31.120 align:start position:0%
and over 2 million serious adverse
 
06:16:34.788 --> 06:16:34.798 align:start position:0%
events this does not include the 20 000
 
06:16:36.948 --> 06:16:36.958 align:start position:0%
deaths in the vars database which is
 
06:16:40.230 --> 06:16:40.240 align:start position:0%
probably a tenth of all deaths due to
 
06:16:43.350 --> 06:16:43.360 align:start position:0%
the vaccine this is their data so
 
06:16:45.910 --> 06:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
somehow the source cov2 vaccines are
 
06:16:47.510 --> 06:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
safe and effective
 
06:16:51.270 --> 06:16:51.280 align:start position:0%
yet ivamectin is a dangerous horse
 
06:16:53.350 --> 06:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
deworming medicine
 
06:16:56.230 --> 06:16:56.240 align:start position:0%
that's an absolute outright lie and the
 
06:16:59.270 --> 06:16:59.280 align:start position:0%
data speaks for itself this is not my
 
06:17:02.948 --> 06:17:02.958 align:start position:0%
data this is from the who and anybody
 
06:17:05.510 --> 06:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
who wants to validate this data can go
 
06:17:10.070 --> 06:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
to vg access and access this data itself
 
06:17:12.788 --> 06:17:12.798 align:start position:0%
as you see more people have died from
 
06:17:12.798 --> 06:17:14.230 align:start position:0%
as you see more people have died from
tylenol

06:17:14.230 --> 06:17:14.240 align:start position:0%
tylenol
 
06:17:16.708 --> 06:17:16.718 align:start position:0%
more people have died from tylenol which
 
06:17:19.270 --> 06:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
is an over-the-counter medicine than
 
06:17:22.548 --> 06:17:22.558 align:start position:0%
ivamekton as i said it is one of the
 
06:17:24.948 --> 06:17:24.958 align:start position:0%
safest medications
 
06:17:31.430 --> 06:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:31.440 --> 06:17:32.948 align:start position:0%
 
so

06:17:32.948 --> 06:17:32.958 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:17:35.110 --> 06:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
if we actually go to the veggie access
 
06:17:37.270 --> 06:17:37.280 align:start position:0%
database and look what the side effects
 
06:17:37.280 --> 06:17:37.990 align:start position:0%
database and look what the side effects
are

06:17:37.990 --> 06:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
are
 
06:17:41.110 --> 06:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
pyrexia which is fever fatigue pain face
 
06:17:43.670 --> 06:17:43.680 align:start position:0%
swelling malaise chest pain these are
 
06:17:46.070 --> 06:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
minor side effects these are the side
 
06:17:48.868 --> 06:17:48.878 align:start position:0%
effects reported with ivamectin which
 
06:17:48.878 --> 06:17:49.590 align:start position:0%
effects reported with ivamectin which
are

06:17:49.590 --> 06:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
are
 
06:17:49.600 --> 06:17:53.750 align:start position:0%
are
minor

06:17:53.750 --> 06:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:56.548 --> 06:17:56.558 align:start position:0%
this is a study 25-year clinical

of the safety if you have a collie dog
 
06:18:03.910 --> 06:18:03.920 align:start position:0%
you do not want to give ivamectin to a
 
06:18:05.670 --> 06:18:05.680 align:start position:0%
collie dog because there's impaired
 
06:18:08.548 --> 06:18:08.558 align:start position:0%
blood brain barrier negligible effects
 
06:18:11.110 --> 06:18:11.120 align:start position:0%

profile
 
06:18:17.430 --> 06:18:17.440 align:start position:0%
most of the side effects are an allergic
 
06:18:20.548 --> 06:18:20.558 align:start position:0%
reaction to the death of microfilaria
 
06:18:23.750 --> 06:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
it's not recommended in pregnancy or
 
06:18:23.760 --> 06:18:25.430 align:start position:0%
it's not recommended in pregnancy or

06:18:25.430 --> 06:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
lactation
 
06:18:28.230 --> 06:18:28.240 align:start position:0%
so there was a caution in the use of in
 
06:18:30.788 --> 06:18:30.798 align:start position:0%
children less than 15 kilograms because
 
06:18:32.470 --> 06:18:32.480 align:start position:0%
of a
 
06:18:34.390 --> 06:18:34.400 align:start position:0%
immature blood-brain barrier they
 
06:18:36.708 --> 06:18:36.718 align:start position:0%
thought it wasn't safe a recent study as
 
06:18:38.788 --> 06:18:38.798 align:start position:0%
you can see published just last year
 
06:18:41.590 --> 06:18:41.600 align:start position:0%
looked at over a thousand kids and found
 
06:18:44.548 --> 06:18:44.558 align:start position:0%
1.4 percent adverse events which were
 
06:18:47.590 --> 06:18:47.600 align:start position:0%
all mild and self-limiting so even in
 
06:18:50.390 --> 06:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
children under the age of 15 this is a
 
06:18:51.990 --> 06:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
safe disease
 
06:18:55.750 --> 06:18:55.760 align:start position:0%

06:18:59.830 --> 06:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
side effects so let's compare rem
 
06:19:02.948 --> 06:19:02.958 align:start position:0%
deservier to iva mektin the cost of rem
 
06:19:05.750 --> 06:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
deserve 30 30 000
 
06:19:08.548 --> 06:19:08.558 align:start position:0%
sorry three thousand dollars a shot
 
06:19:11.430 --> 06:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
either mack and pennies has either as
 
06:19:13.590 --> 06:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
rem destiny have been shown to reduce
 
06:19:15.110 --> 06:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
the risk of death the answer is
 
06:19:18.150 --> 06:19:18.160 align:start position:0%
definitively and categorically no rem
 
06:19:20.708 --> 06:19:20.718 align:start position:0%
deserver increases the risk of dying by
 
06:19:23.190 --> 06:19:23.200 align:start position:0%
four percent let me say that again this
 
06:19:25.830 --> 06:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
is used throughout the entire country as
 
06:19:28.070 --> 06:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
first line therapy for hospitalized
 
06:19:30.788 --> 06:19:30.798 align:start position:0%
patients it increases the risk of death
 
06:19:33.270 --> 06:19:33.280 align:start position:0%
by four percent and what is now most
 
06:19:35.110 --> 06:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
outrageous is the federal government
 
06:19:37.670 --> 06:19:37.680 align:start position:0%
gives hospitals a 20
 
06:19:40.390 --> 06:19:40.400 align:start position:0%
bonus on the entire hospital bill for
 
06:19:43.190 --> 06:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
medicare patients if they prescribe rem
 
06:19:46.230 --> 06:19:46.240 align:start position:0%
deserve that's the truth
 
06:19:49.510 --> 06:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
ibmecton reduces the risk by 50 percent
 
06:19:51.510 --> 06:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
can you use rendezvous at home no
 
06:19:54.628 --> 06:19:54.638 align:start position:0%
ivamectin yes causes organ damage yes
 
06:19:57.750 --> 06:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
rim deserve is nephrotoxic studies which
 
06:20:00.788 --> 06:20:00.798 align:start position:0%
were required to approve rem deserve
 
06:20:00.798 --> 06:20:01.590 align:start position:0%
were required to approve rem deserve
one

06:20:01.590 --> 06:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
one
 
06:20:05.350 --> 06:20:05.360 align:start position:0%
study which was scientific misconduct i
 
06:20:07.510 --> 06:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
haven't met in over 60 studies and
 
06:20:10.230 --> 06:20:10.240 align:start position:0%
cannot be considered major conflicts of
 
06:20:12.150 --> 06:20:12.160 align:start position:0%
interest yes and no
 
06:20:16.948 --> 06:20:16.958 align:start position:0%
support by the fda and falci yes and no
 
06:20:19.830 --> 06:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
so this is a little handout from the who
 
06:20:22.070 --> 06:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
the world health organization in their
 
06:20:24.830 --> 06:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
promotion of ivamectin for the
 
06:20:28.350 --> 06:20:28.360 align:start position:0%
eradication of parasitic diseases the
 
06:20:31.590 --> 06:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
2-2-2-2 rule 200 mics per kilogram per
 
06:20:35.110 --> 06:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
day two tabs per day of six milligrams
 
06:20:37.430 --> 06:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
you take it for two days and the price
 
06:20:39.750 --> 06:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
to the who
 
06:20:41.670 --> 06:20:41.680 align:start position:0%
two cents
 
06:20:43.270 --> 06:20:43.280 align:start position:0%
two cents
 
06:20:45.110 --> 06:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
that's what it costs them
 
06:20:48.788 --> 06:20:48.798 align:start position:0%
so you know that is my brief overview
 
06:20:50.628 --> 06:20:50.638 align:start position:0%
this is a cheap drug
 
06:20:52.708 --> 06:20:52.718 align:start position:0%
it's exceedingly safe
 
06:20:54.948 --> 06:20:54.958 align:start position:0%
it's exceedingly effective
 
06:20:57.190 --> 06:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
and patient should be offered the right
 
06:20:59.350 --> 06:20:59.360 align:start position:0%
to use this drug we're not telling
 
06:21:01.830 --> 06:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
doctors what to do but this should be an
 
06:21:04.708 --> 06:21:04.718 align:start position:0%
option and if either magnet had been
 
06:21:06.390 --> 06:21:06.400 align:start position:0%
promoted at the beginning of this
 
06:21:06.400 --> 06:21:08.310 align:start position:0%
promoted at the beginning of this
pandemic

06:21:08.310 --> 06:21:08.320 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
06:21:11.350 --> 06:21:11.360 align:start position:0%
we would not be sitting here today
 
06:21:14.468 --> 06:21:14.478 align:start position:0%
thank you and i'll take any questions
 
06:21:18.628 --> 06:21:18.638 align:start position:0%
any questions for dr merrick
 
06:21:21.350 --> 06:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro
 
06:21:23.190 --> 06:21:23.200 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
06:21:24.868 --> 06:21:24.878 align:start position:0%
taking the question
 
06:21:24.878 --> 06:21:26.070 align:start position:0%
taking the question
um

06:21:26.070 --> 06:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:21:28.548 --> 06:21:28.558 align:start position:0%
many people have contacted me
 
06:21:28.558 --> 06:21:31.190 align:start position:0%
many people have contacted me
about

06:21:31.190 --> 06:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:33.190 --> 06:21:33.200 align:start position:0%
about wanting the opportunity to use
 
06:21:33.200 --> 06:21:34.468 align:start position:0%
about wanting the opportunity to use
hypervectin

06:21:34.468 --> 06:21:34.478 align:start position:0%
hypervectin
 
06:21:37.670 --> 06:21:37.680 align:start position:0%
and they frequently refer to
 
06:21:39.350 --> 06:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
trying to stay near the microphone and
 
06:21:41.430 --> 06:21:41.440 align:start position:0%
see you at the same time
 
06:21:43.590 --> 06:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
and they frequently refer to that a
 
06:21:45.430 --> 06:21:45.440 align:start position:0%
patient and a doctor should be able to
 
06:21:47.510 --> 06:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
work together to make a
 
06:21:49.430 --> 06:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
a reasonable choice
 
06:21:51.750 --> 06:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
however the mechanism in this bill by
 
06:21:54.708 --> 06:21:54.718 align:start position:0%
which iverbectin would become available
 
06:21:56.708 --> 06:21:56.718 align:start position:0%
is really
 
06:21:59.110 --> 06:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
precluding the doctor's involvement
 
06:22:01.190 --> 06:22:01.200 align:start position:0%
because this would be a standing order
 
06:22:02.628 --> 06:22:02.638 align:start position:0%
to pharmacies
 
06:22:06.230 --> 06:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
and therefore the doctor would have no
 
06:22:09.110 --> 06:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
real contact with the patients
 
06:22:11.350 --> 06:22:11.360 align:start position:0%
so i understand you're a proponent of
 
06:22:13.030 --> 06:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
hyperbactin that came across very
 
06:22:15.510 --> 06:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
clearly but is this the way to do it
 
06:22:17.030 --> 06:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
with really like
 
06:22:20.150 --> 06:22:20.160 align:start position:0%
reducing the doctor's involvement in the
 
06:22:22.548 --> 06:22:22.558 align:start position:0%
prescription of
 
06:22:24.310 --> 06:22:24.320 align:start position:0%
hypervectin that's a good question i
 
06:22:25.270 --> 06:22:25.280 align:start position:0%
think there should always be a
 
06:22:26.788 --> 06:22:26.798 align:start position:0%
discussion between the doctor and the
 
06:22:28.708 --> 06:22:28.718 align:start position:0%
patient but i think the problem is there
 
06:22:30.708 --> 06:22:30.718 align:start position:0%
are many doctors who will not prescribe
 
06:22:33.350 --> 06:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
it because of all the misinformation and
 
06:22:35.830 --> 06:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
the threats against them
 
06:22:38.468 --> 06:22:38.478 align:start position:0%
recently a doctor in maine i think had
 
06:22:40.788 --> 06:22:40.798 align:start position:0%
her license suspended and she was sent
 
06:22:44.230 --> 06:22:44.240 align:start position:0%
for neuropsychiatric testing because she
 
06:22:47.030 --> 06:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
prescribed ivamectin so i think this is
 
06:22:49.830 --> 06:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
a way around this i agree with you is
 
06:22:52.310 --> 06:22:52.320 align:start position:0%
that there needs to be open dialogue we
 
06:22:54.708 --> 06:22:54.718 align:start position:0%
need to have open dialogue on everything
 
06:22:56.868 --> 06:22:56.878 align:start position:0%
to do with covet we need to have open
 
06:22:59.110 --> 06:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
discussions science is based on
 
06:23:01.590 --> 06:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
questions so i agree with you i think
 
06:23:03.510 --> 06:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
that there should be a discussion with a
 
06:23:05.430 --> 06:23:05.440 align:start position:0%
physician but i think patients should
 
06:23:07.990 --> 06:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
also be given the option to control
 
06:23:10.868 --> 06:23:10.878 align:start position:0%
their own life and what they think so i
 
06:23:12.788 --> 06:23:12.798 align:start position:0%
think in terms of you know i think it's
 
06:23:15.190 --> 06:23:15.200 align:start position:0%
the way you position this is we
 
06:23:17.430 --> 06:23:17.440 align:start position:0%
recommend early treatment early
 
06:23:19.670 --> 06:23:19.680 align:start position:0%
treatment is absolutely critical to keep
 
06:23:22.070 --> 06:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
people outside of the hospital
 
06:23:24.468 --> 06:23:24.478 align:start position:0%
what the nih says is there's no
 
06:23:26.310 --> 06:23:26.320 align:start position:0%
treatment you stay at home until you go
 
06:23:29.270 --> 06:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
blue when you go blue come to the icu
 
06:23:32.070 --> 06:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
that's obviously ridiculous so i think
 
06:23:35.030 --> 06:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
early treatment is absolutely critical
 
06:23:37.510 --> 06:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
it prevents transmission of the disease
 
06:23:39.350 --> 06:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
it prevents transmission to the family
 
06:23:40.468 --> 06:23:40.478 align:start position:0%
and it takes
 
06:23:42.868 --> 06:23:42.878 align:start position:0%
it controls the disease so obviously i
 
06:23:44.230 --> 06:23:44.240 align:start position:0%
think there need to be some kind of
 
06:23:47.510 --> 06:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
controls in its use but i think it's an
 
06:23:47.520 --> 06:23:50.868 align:start position:0%
controls in its use but i think it's an
option

06:23:50.868 --> 06:23:50.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:53.110 --> 06:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
06:23:53.120 --> 06:23:55.830 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
merchant

06:23:55.830 --> 06:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:57.830 --> 06:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
thank you chair hopefully you can hear
 
06:24:00.868 --> 06:24:00.878 align:start position:0%
me doctor yes sir
 
06:24:03.270 --> 06:24:03.280 align:start position:0%
i notice in the bill
 
06:24:04.788 --> 06:24:04.798 align:start position:0%
that there's a requirement for a
 
06:24:08.070 --> 06:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
protocol for the pharmacist to follow so
 
06:24:10.548 --> 06:24:10.558 align:start position:0%
basically they're not just giving it out
 
06:24:12.548 --> 06:24:12.558 align:start position:0%
willy-nilly they're having to go through
 
06:24:14.310 --> 06:24:14.320 align:start position:0%
some sort of an assessment based upon
 
06:24:16.150 --> 06:24:16.160 align:start position:0%
the protocol yes sir so even though it's
 
06:24:17.750 --> 06:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
not a discussion with the prescriber the
 
06:24:20.070 --> 06:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
doctor that is basically following a
 
06:24:21.510 --> 06:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
discussion the doctor would probably
 
06:24:24.548 --> 06:24:24.558 align:start position:0%
outline via the protocol
 
06:24:26.548 --> 06:24:26.558 align:start position:0%
now in 79 other countries throughout
 
06:24:28.310 --> 06:24:28.320 align:start position:0%
this world
 
06:24:31.270 --> 06:24:31.280 align:start position:0%
i know i can walk into mexico
 
06:24:33.350 --> 06:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
and buy drugs that are not available
 
06:24:33.360 --> 06:24:34.548 align:start position:0%
and buy drugs that are not available
here

06:24:34.548 --> 06:24:34.558 align:start position:0%
here
 
06:24:36.788 --> 06:24:36.798 align:start position:0%
without following any protocol all i
 
06:24:38.948 --> 06:24:38.958 align:start position:0%
have to do is put my cash on the
 
06:24:41.910 --> 06:24:41.920 align:start position:0%
counter and i can buy it yes do you feel
 
06:24:43.830 --> 06:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
comfortable that with the insertion of a
 
06:24:46.708 --> 06:24:46.718 align:start position:0%
protocol written by the prescriber for
 
06:24:48.390 --> 06:24:48.400 align:start position:0%
the pharmacist to follow
 
06:24:50.150 --> 06:24:50.160 align:start position:0%
is that sufficiently safe for the
 
06:24:50.160 --> 06:24:51.190 align:start position:0%
is that sufficiently safe for the
patient

06:24:51.190 --> 06:24:51.200 align:start position:0%
patient
 
06:24:53.750 --> 06:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
yes absolutely i think there's a
 
06:24:56.708 --> 06:24:56.718 align:start position:0%
standard dosing the pharmacist can then
 
06:24:58.948 --> 06:24:58.958 align:start position:0%
look for drug interactions because there
 
06:25:01.350 --> 06:25:01.360 align:start position:0%
are some drugs which interact so clearly
 
06:25:03.990 --> 06:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
if the pharmacist is given a protocol he
 
06:25:06.548 --> 06:25:06.558 align:start position:0%
knows how to dose it the number of days
 
06:25:08.868 --> 06:25:08.878 align:start position:0%
and he knows their significant drug
 
06:25:11.590 --> 06:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
interactions and he follows a protocol
 
06:25:13.030 --> 06:25:13.040 align:start position:0%
because to tell you the truth
 
06:25:15.270 --> 06:25:15.280 align:start position:0%
unfortunately in this country most
 
06:25:17.910 --> 06:25:17.920 align:start position:0%
doctors follow protocols they have lost
 
06:25:20.708 --> 06:25:20.718 align:start position:0%
the ability of any cognitive thought
 
06:25:22.868 --> 06:25:22.878 align:start position:0%
process they just blindly follow
 
06:25:25.510 --> 06:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
protocols so a doctor following blindly
 
06:25:27.910 --> 06:25:27.920 align:start position:0%
a protocol or a pharmacist who may be
 
06:25:29.750 --> 06:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
more informed in terms of drug
 
06:25:29.760 --> 06:25:31.110 align:start position:0%
more informed in terms of drug
interactions

06:25:31.110 --> 06:25:31.120 align:start position:0%
interactions
 
06:25:33.670 --> 06:25:33.680 align:start position:0%
maybe a safer way to go so you are
 
06:25:35.750 --> 06:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
correct there are some drug interactions
 
06:25:38.070 --> 06:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
which most doctors aren't even aware of
 
06:25:40.150 --> 06:25:40.160 align:start position:0%
that a pharmacist should be aware of and
 
06:25:42.468 --> 06:25:42.478 align:start position:0%
then he will be able to judge is this
 
06:25:44.390 --> 06:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
the right dose do i need to adjust the
 
06:25:47.190 --> 06:25:47.200 align:start position:0%
dose and is the safe for example patient
 
06:25:49.190 --> 06:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
may be on coumadin which is a blood
 
06:25:51.030 --> 06:25:51.040 align:start position:0%
thinner as you know if they aren't
 
06:25:52.868 --> 06:25:52.878 align:start position:0%
coumadin then they need to adjust the
 
06:25:55.590 --> 06:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
dose and most doctors won't know this so
 
06:25:57.350 --> 06:25:57.360 align:start position:0%
you absolutely correct i think a good
 
06:26:00.230 --> 06:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
protocol and a pharmacist that is
 
06:26:00.240 --> 06:26:01.510 align:start position:0%
protocol and a pharmacist that is
diligent

06:26:01.510 --> 06:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
diligent
 
06:26:04.948 --> 06:26:04.958 align:start position:0%
is very is a very safe way to go
 
06:26:04.958 --> 06:26:07.110 align:start position:0%
is very is a very safe way to go
representative

06:26:07.110 --> 06:26:07.120 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:26:08.948 --> 06:26:08.958 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman doctor thank you
 
06:26:10.230 --> 06:26:10.240 align:start position:0%
for coming thank you for taking my
 
06:26:12.070 --> 06:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
question i hope that we have saved you
 
06:26:16.468 --> 06:26:16.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:18.230 --> 06:26:18.240 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you it's the weather here is
 
06:26:20.708 --> 06:26:20.718 align:start position:0%
wonderful thank you
 
06:26:22.788 --> 06:26:22.798 align:start position:0%
doctor can you tell me who has sponsored
 
06:26:24.310 --> 06:26:24.320 align:start position:0%
your trip here today
 
06:26:26.788 --> 06:26:26.798 align:start position:0%
um that's a good question
 
06:26:29.190 --> 06:26:29.200 align:start position:0%
because i paid most of it i paid out of
 
06:26:31.270 --> 06:26:31.280 align:start position:0%
my own pocket some of it i may be
 
06:26:34.150 --> 06:26:34.160 align:start position:0%
reimbursed by the flcc which is the
 
06:26:37.110 --> 06:26:37.120 align:start position:0%
organization that we started which is a
 
06:26:37.120 --> 06:26:38.830 align:start position:0%
organization that we started which is a
non-for-profit

06:26:38.830 --> 06:26:38.840 align:start position:0%
non-for-profit
 
06:26:41.910 --> 06:26:41.920 align:start position:0%
organization thank you thank you
 
06:26:43.670 --> 06:26:43.680 align:start position:0%
any further questions for the doctor
 
06:26:46.468 --> 06:26:46.478 align:start position:0%
before we let him go dr woods
 
06:26:48.310 --> 06:26:48.320 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair and uh thank you
 
06:26:50.310 --> 06:26:50.320 align:start position:0%
doctor for taking my question question
 
06:26:52.948 --> 06:26:52.958 align:start position:0%
and i'll have a follow-up uh just i'm
 
06:26:55.430 --> 06:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
trying to get a sense of balance of the
 
06:26:57.910 --> 06:26:57.920 align:start position:0%
use of ivermectin which is
 
06:27:00.628 --> 06:27:00.638 align:start position:0%
at least portrayed as this miracle that
 
06:27:02.708 --> 06:27:02.718 align:start position:0%
would have saved the world
 
06:27:04.230 --> 06:27:04.240 align:start position:0%
uh how would you
 
06:27:06.830 --> 06:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
put that in balance if everyone in the
 
06:27:09.350 --> 06:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
country would have
 
06:27:10.628 --> 06:27:10.638 align:start position:0%
taken the
 
06:27:12.868 --> 06:27:12.878 align:start position:0%
recommendation for masking
 
06:27:14.468 --> 06:27:14.478 align:start position:0%
and distancing
 
06:27:17.190 --> 06:27:17.200 align:start position:0%
had say done that protocol
 
06:27:21.350 --> 06:27:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:21.360 --> 06:27:21.830 align:start position:0%
 
yes hypermectin

06:27:21.830 --> 06:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
yes hypermectin
 
06:27:25.110 --> 06:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
you ask an interesting question
 
06:27:27.270 --> 06:27:27.280 align:start position:0%
which is very political
 
06:27:27.280 --> 06:27:27.990 align:start position:0%
which is very political
so

06:27:27.990 --> 06:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:27:30.310 --> 06:27:30.320 align:start position:0%
um i actually reviewed the science on
 
06:27:32.070 --> 06:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
wearing a mask
 
06:27:35.350 --> 06:27:35.360 align:start position:0%
actually the likelihood is mass increase
 
06:27:37.750 --> 06:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
the risk of complications when you wear
 
06:27:40.708 --> 06:27:40.718 align:start position:0%
a mask it increases your dead space it
 
06:27:43.670 --> 06:27:43.680 align:start position:0%
increases respiratory resistance so it
 
06:27:45.910 --> 06:27:45.920 align:start position:0%
causes your blood oxygen levels to go
 
06:27:45.920 --> 06:27:46.788 align:start position:0%
causes your blood oxygen levels to go
down

06:27:46.788 --> 06:27:46.798 align:start position:0%
down
 
06:27:48.868 --> 06:27:48.878 align:start position:0%
there's very little data
 
06:27:52.628 --> 06:27:52.638 align:start position:0%
that except an n95 an n95 is a different
 
06:27:55.510 --> 06:27:55.520 align:start position:0%
story but using these cloth and surgical
 
06:27:57.350 --> 06:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
masks actually
 
06:27:59.830 --> 06:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
likely provide no protection and
 
06:28:02.310 --> 06:28:02.320 align:start position:0%
obviously have lots of deleterious side
 
06:28:04.708 --> 06:28:04.718 align:start position:0%
effects social distancing obviously is
 
06:28:06.628 --> 06:28:06.638 align:start position:0%
important to some degree
 
06:28:08.628 --> 06:28:08.638 align:start position:0%
but is not going to eliminate this
 
06:28:11.430 --> 06:28:11.440 align:start position:0%
disease what i should also say is that
 
06:28:13.990 --> 06:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
there's no magic bullet for covet
 
06:28:15.670 --> 06:28:15.680 align:start position:0%
there's no magic bullet it's a
 
06:28:18.230 --> 06:28:18.240 align:start position:0%
multi-pronged approach and they're
 
06:28:20.628 --> 06:28:20.638 align:start position:0%
multiple things people can do to reduce
 
06:28:23.030 --> 06:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
their risk of getting covert the most
 
06:28:25.590 --> 06:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
important is vitamin d if you have a
 
06:28:28.948 --> 06:28:28.958 align:start position:0%
vitamin d level over 50 your chances of
 
06:28:30.548 --> 06:28:30.558 align:start position:0%
dying of covert
 
06:28:33.190 --> 06:28:33.200 align:start position:0%
are close to zero and since you're up
 
06:28:34.948 --> 06:28:34.958 align:start position:0%
here now the north pole you don't see a
 
06:28:37.270 --> 06:28:37.280 align:start position:0%
lot of sun it's absolutely essential
 
06:28:40.468 --> 06:28:40.478 align:start position:0%
that everyone in the state takes vitamin
 
06:28:43.590 --> 06:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
d it's not even controversial anymore
 
06:28:46.230 --> 06:28:46.240 align:start position:0%
then there's oropharyngeal hygiene
 
06:28:48.548 --> 06:28:48.558 align:start position:0%
there's vitamin c so there are a whole
 
06:28:50.708 --> 06:28:50.718 align:start position:0%
host of things that people can do to
 
06:28:53.990 --> 06:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
empower themselves empower themselves
 
06:28:56.150 --> 06:28:56.160 align:start position:0%
not to get covered and then when you get
 
06:28:58.310 --> 06:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
covert it's a multi-pronged approach
 
06:29:01.670 --> 06:29:01.680 align:start position:0%
it's not just ivermectin so as dr
 
06:29:03.430 --> 06:29:03.440 align:start position:0%
kushman i'm going to call her dr cushman
 
06:29:07.750 --> 06:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
said in uttar pradesh they have a covert
 
06:29:11.590 --> 06:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
kit it's a covet kit that is eliminated
 
06:29:14.548 --> 06:29:14.558 align:start position:0%
covered they use a kit that has vitamin
 
06:29:14.558 --> 06:29:15.670 align:start position:0%
covered they use a kit that has vitamin
d

06:29:15.670 --> 06:29:15.680 align:start position:0%
d
 
06:29:18.070 --> 06:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
tylenol ivamectin
 
06:29:20.548 --> 06:29:20.558 align:start position:0%
and uttar pradesh as of yesterday it's a
 
06:29:24.468 --> 06:29:24.478 align:start position:0%
province of 220 million people had one
 
06:29:24.478 --> 06:29:25.510 align:start position:0%
province of 220 million people had one
death

06:29:25.510 --> 06:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
death
 
06:29:27.910 --> 06:29:27.920 align:start position:0%
one death in the whole province of uttar
 
06:29:30.390 --> 06:29:30.400 align:start position:0%
pradesh which has a vaccination rate of
 
06:29:33.350 --> 06:29:33.360 align:start position:0%
about 30 percent so it's a multi-pronged
 
06:29:36.390 --> 06:29:36.400 align:start position:0%
approach and unfortunately i think the
 
06:29:38.468 --> 06:29:38.478 align:start position:0%
federal response to covet has been an
 
06:29:40.070 --> 06:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
absolute failure
 
06:29:42.390 --> 06:29:42.400 align:start position:0%
and things have to change because
 
06:29:44.788 --> 06:29:44.798 align:start position:0%
despite all the mandates and everything
 
06:29:46.948 --> 06:29:46.958 align:start position:0%
else that's going on i mean people got
 
06:29:49.190 --> 06:29:49.200 align:start position:0%
to look what's happening omicron is all
 
06:29:52.070 --> 06:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
over the place and it shouldn't be
 
06:29:54.948 --> 06:29:54.958 align:start position:0%
and we know that 80 of people who
 
06:29:57.590 --> 06:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
vaccinated get omicron so something has
 
06:30:00.548 --> 06:30:00.558 align:start position:0%
failed omicron is out of control so
 
06:30:02.628 --> 06:30:02.638 align:start position:0%
there has been a massive failure of the
 
06:30:05.750 --> 06:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
system and it has to be multifaceted
 
06:30:07.750 --> 06:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
sorry there was a long answer to your
 
06:30:08.948 --> 06:30:08.958 align:start position:0%
question but
 
06:30:10.468 --> 06:30:10.478 align:start position:0%
you asked the question
 
06:30:13.510 --> 06:30:13.520 align:start position:0%
i just want to note dr paul that um
 
06:30:15.910 --> 06:30:15.920 align:start position:0%
every nurse i've ever known
 
06:30:19.750 --> 06:30:19.760 align:start position:0%
was thrilled when she or he were called
 
06:30:19.760 --> 06:30:21.750 align:start position:0%
was thrilled when she or he were called
doctor

06:30:21.750 --> 06:30:21.760 align:start position:0%
doctor
 
06:30:24.628 --> 06:30:24.638 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for the promotion you did
 
06:30:26.548 --> 06:30:26.558 align:start position:0%
such an outstanding job
 
06:30:29.270 --> 06:30:29.280 align:start position:0%
representative folsom
 
06:30:30.948 --> 06:30:30.958 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
06:30:32.390 --> 06:30:32.400 align:start position:0%
my question
 
06:30:33.830 --> 06:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
would you
 
06:30:37.830 --> 06:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
find it a much better situation if our
 
06:30:40.150 --> 06:30:40.160 align:start position:0%
pharmacists were able to have a standing
 
06:30:42.868 --> 06:30:42.878 align:start position:0%
order and people went to our pharmacist
 
06:30:45.670 --> 06:30:45.680 align:start position:0%
rather than trying to find the drug in a
 
06:30:48.310 --> 06:30:48.320 align:start position:0%
plethora of other places you absolutely
 
06:30:50.468 --> 06:30:50.478 align:start position:0%
correct people will do what they have to
 
06:30:53.110 --> 06:30:53.120 align:start position:0%
do you know when people are desperate as
 
06:30:54.628 --> 06:30:54.638 align:start position:0%
you know they have a loved one who's
 
06:30:56.868 --> 06:30:56.878 align:start position:0%
sick and dying they will do whatever
 
06:30:59.190 --> 06:30:59.200 align:start position:0%
they can do and they're going to use
 
06:31:01.270 --> 06:31:01.280 align:start position:0%
veterinary grade other mechan which we
 
06:31:03.270 --> 06:31:03.280 align:start position:0%
don't recommend but you know what when
 
06:31:04.628 --> 06:31:04.638 align:start position:0%
your back's against the wall and you
 
06:31:07.350 --> 06:31:07.360 align:start position:0%
have no options people will do this so
 
06:31:09.510 --> 06:31:09.520 align:start position:0%
that's why you put your point is
 
06:31:12.628 --> 06:31:12.638 align:start position:0%
absolutely correct it's much safer to do
 
06:31:15.590 --> 06:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
it under a supervised setting than
 
06:31:18.708 --> 06:31:18.718 align:start position:0%
people going to you know horse stores
 
06:31:21.830 --> 06:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
and and and hardware stores and buying
 
06:31:23.990 --> 06:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
veterinary grade ivormectin because we
 
06:31:26.070 --> 06:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
don't know the quality we don't know the
 
06:31:29.110 --> 06:31:29.120 align:start position:0%
grade they don't know the dosing so your
 
06:31:30.948 --> 06:31:30.958 align:start position:0%
question is absolutely correct and there
 
06:31:33.350 --> 06:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
are hundreds of thousands of people who
 
06:31:35.910 --> 06:31:35.920 align:start position:0%
have used veterinary grade ivermectin
 
06:31:37.510 --> 06:31:37.520 align:start position:0%
what they even do
 
06:31:39.430 --> 06:31:39.440 align:start position:0%
i can tell you a story of a two-year-old
 
06:31:43.270 --> 06:31:43.280 align:start position:0%
little girl in in a highly sophisticated
 
06:31:46.310 --> 06:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
icu the parents rubbed on ivermectin
 
06:31:48.150 --> 06:31:48.160 align:start position:0%
because ivamectin is absorbed
 
06:31:48.160 --> 06:31:49.830 align:start position:0%
because ivamectin is absorbed
transcutaneously

06:31:49.830 --> 06:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
transcutaneously
 
06:31:52.468 --> 06:31:52.478 align:start position:0%
they thought this child was going to die
 
06:31:54.310 --> 06:31:54.320 align:start position:0%
they told the parents your child is
 
06:31:56.708 --> 06:31:56.718 align:start position:0%
going to die unbeknownst to them the
 
06:31:58.628 --> 06:31:58.638 align:start position:0%
parents rubbed either magden on the
 
06:32:01.430 --> 06:32:01.440 align:start position:0%
child's chest the child made a
 
06:32:03.910 --> 06:32:03.920 align:start position:0%
miraculous recovery which they didn't
 
06:32:06.468 --> 06:32:06.478 align:start position:0%
understand we've had priests who come
 
06:32:08.788 --> 06:32:08.798 align:start position:0%
into the hospital and anoint their
 
06:32:11.510 --> 06:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
patients with ivamectin
 
06:32:14.070 --> 06:32:14.080 align:start position:0%
so you know what why why do we have to
 
06:32:16.390 --> 06:32:16.400 align:start position:0%
go to these extreme and ridiculous
 
06:32:19.990 --> 06:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
measures just so this is an fda approved
 
06:32:22.788 --> 06:32:22.798 align:start position:0%
drug forty percent of drugs used in the
 
06:32:26.948 --> 06:32:26.958 align:start position:0%
hospital are fda off label the fda until
 
06:32:29.350 --> 06:32:29.360 align:start position:0%
two years ago promoted the use of
 
06:32:32.628 --> 06:32:32.638 align:start position:0%
off-label drugs they said these drugs
 
06:32:35.750 --> 06:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
can be prescribed by the physician at
 
06:32:38.070 --> 06:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
their clinical judgment
 
06:32:39.910 --> 06:32:39.920 align:start position:0%
what's happening now is the federal
 
06:32:42.310 --> 06:32:42.320 align:start position:0%
government the states and hospitals are
 
06:32:45.190 --> 06:32:45.200 align:start position:0%
telling doctors how to practice medicine
 
06:32:46.948 --> 06:32:46.958 align:start position:0%
they're telling doctors how to practice
 
06:32:49.510 --> 06:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
medicine let doctors be doctors let
 
06:32:52.070 --> 06:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
doctors do what they train to do and
 
06:32:54.070 --> 06:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
that doctor can decide for themselves
 
06:32:55.910 --> 06:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
what they want to do but we should not
 
06:32:57.430 --> 06:32:57.440 align:start position:0%
have the state
 
06:33:00.310 --> 06:33:00.320 align:start position:0%
or the federal government or hospitals
 
06:33:03.030 --> 06:33:03.040 align:start position:0%
dictating how doctors practice medicine
 
06:33:05.270 --> 06:33:05.280 align:start position:0%
that's not the hippocratic way and it's
 
06:33:07.510 --> 06:33:07.520 align:start position:0%
not the way medicine is practiced so
 
06:33:10.070 --> 06:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
absolutely i agree with you 100 thank
 
06:33:10.080 --> 06:33:12.230 align:start position:0%
absolutely i agree with you 100 thank
you

06:33:12.230 --> 06:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:33:14.390 --> 06:33:14.400 align:start position:0%
dr woods
 
06:33:16.390 --> 06:33:16.400 align:start position:0%
uh thank you again
 
06:33:18.788 --> 06:33:18.798 align:start position:0%
for letting me take the question mr
 
06:33:20.390 --> 06:33:20.400 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking another
 
06:33:22.948 --> 06:33:22.958 align:start position:0%
question should i just if you could help
 
06:33:24.390 --> 06:33:24.400 align:start position:0%
me drill down
 
06:33:27.910 --> 06:33:27.920 align:start position:0%
uh on your you know it's not numbered um
 
06:33:30.230 --> 06:33:30.240 align:start position:0%
the world health organization fda merc
 
06:33:32.390 --> 06:33:32.400 align:start position:0%
sheet about deaths
 
06:33:35.868 --> 06:33:35.878 align:start position:0%
um it's highlighted there's 14
 
06:33:35.878 --> 06:33:37.510 align:start position:0%
um it's highlighted there's 14
774.

06:33:37.510 --> 06:33:37.520 align:start position:0%
774.
 
06:33:37.520 --> 06:33:38.788 align:start position:0%
774.
um

06:33:38.788 --> 06:33:38.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:33:41.270 --> 06:33:41.280 align:start position:0%
could you expand on where that data
 
06:33:43.990 --> 06:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
comes from and how it was collected
 
06:33:47.590 --> 06:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
yes so this is an international
 
06:33:51.670 --> 06:33:51.680 align:start position:0%
collaborative drug monitoring service so
 
06:33:54.948 --> 06:33:54.958 align:start position:0%
run by the who so what happens is they
 
06:33:58.468 --> 06:33:58.478 align:start position:0%
collect or they have partnerships with
 
06:34:00.990 --> 06:34:01.000 align:start position:0%
countries across the world and who have
 
06:34:03.350 --> 06:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
pharmacovigilance and this data is sent
 
06:34:04.468 --> 06:34:04.478 align:start position:0%
to them
 
06:34:06.628 --> 06:34:06.638 align:start position:0%
and then the data the
 
06:34:09.430 --> 06:34:09.440 align:start position:0%
the documents get screened and then put
 
06:34:12.150 --> 06:34:12.160 align:start position:0%
in this database so this is likely an
 
06:34:14.628 --> 06:34:14.638 align:start position:0%
underestimate of the true number of
 
06:34:14.638 --> 06:34:15.670 align:start position:0%
underestimate of the true number of
deaths

06:34:15.670 --> 06:34:15.680 align:start position:0%
deaths
 
06:34:20.070 --> 06:34:20.080 align:start position:0%
so it is 14 774 as of last week if we
 
06:34:22.390 --> 06:34:22.400 align:start position:0%
look at the vars database which is
 
06:34:24.628 --> 06:34:24.638 align:start position:0%
vaccine associated adverse events in the
 
06:34:28.788 --> 06:34:28.798 align:start position:0%
u.s currently it's 20 000. so this is 20
 
06:34:31.350 --> 06:34:31.360 align:start position:0%
000 deaths in the u.s the erect the
 
06:34:34.230 --> 06:34:34.240 align:start position:0%
assessment is that is probably one-tenth
 
06:34:37.350 --> 06:34:37.360 align:start position:0%
of the actual deaths so that's 200 000
 
06:34:41.110 --> 06:34:41.120 align:start position:0%
deaths directly due to the vaccine so
 
06:34:43.910 --> 06:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
that's in the vas database anybody can
 
06:34:47.350 --> 06:34:47.360 align:start position:0%
go and look this is in the vg access
 
06:34:50.230 --> 06:34:50.240 align:start position:0%
database so this raises serious
 
06:34:51.670 --> 06:34:51.680 align:start position:0%
questions about
 
06:34:53.830 --> 06:34:53.840 align:start position:0%
it's being safe and effective because
 
06:34:56.468 --> 06:34:56.478 align:start position:0%
even using the wh own
 
06:35:00.390 --> 06:35:00.400 align:start position:0%
data or using the cdc's own data there
 
06:35:03.270 --> 06:35:03.280 align:start position:0%
are significant number of deaths related
 
06:35:05.910 --> 06:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
to the vaccines and you know that's a
 
06:35:07.910 --> 06:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
different question and this wasn't about
 
06:35:10.310 --> 06:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
the vaccines this was about ivamectin
 
06:35:13.030 --> 06:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
but i think it shows the hypocrisy in
 
06:35:15.670 --> 06:35:15.680 align:start position:0%
that ivormectin is considered dangerous
 
06:35:18.150 --> 06:35:18.160 align:start position:0%
deworming horse medicine whereas the
 
06:35:19.670 --> 06:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
vaccines are considered safe and
 
06:35:22.548 --> 06:35:22.558 align:start position:0%
effective and the data does not support
 
06:35:24.628 --> 06:35:24.638 align:start position:0%
that narrative
 
06:35:25.990 --> 06:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
06:35:30.628 --> 06:35:30.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:30.638 --> 06:35:37.750 align:start position:0%
 
microphone

06:35:37.750 --> 06:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:40.070 --> 06:35:40.080 align:start position:0%
it can be brought closer to you
 
06:35:43.270 --> 06:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
there you go how's that wonderful
 
06:35:43.280 --> 06:35:44.868 align:start position:0%
there you go how's that wonderful
okay

06:35:44.868 --> 06:35:44.878 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:35:46.708 --> 06:35:46.718 align:start position:0%
are you aware doctor that here in new
 
06:35:49.110 --> 06:35:49.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire doctors are prescribing
 
06:35:51.750 --> 06:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
ivermectin but there is only one
 
06:35:55.030 --> 06:35:55.040 align:start position:0%
pharmacy in the entire state in salem
 
06:35:57.510 --> 06:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire that is a privately owned
 
06:35:59.830 --> 06:35:59.840 align:start position:0%
apothecary and they are dispensing
 
06:36:02.548 --> 06:36:02.558 align:start position:0%
ivermectin but no other pharmacies in
 
06:36:05.670 --> 06:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
the entire state are uh are dispensing
 
06:36:07.910 --> 06:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
ivermectin at the request and
 
06:36:10.310 --> 06:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
prescription of the doctors
 
06:36:12.468 --> 06:36:12.478 align:start position:0%
yes so we know this is an issue that
 
06:36:14.708 --> 06:36:14.718 align:start position:0%
pharmacists are practicing medicine
 
06:36:17.030 --> 06:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
they're looking at icd-9 codes to see
 
06:36:19.670 --> 06:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
what the indication is that's illegal
 
06:36:22.628 --> 06:36:22.638 align:start position:0%
pharmacists are not permitted to
 
06:36:24.548 --> 06:36:24.558 align:start position:0%
act as doctors what they can do is they
 
06:36:26.708 --> 06:36:26.718 align:start position:0%
can look for drug interactions and they
 
06:36:29.190 --> 06:36:29.200 align:start position:0%
have a legal obligation to fulfill the
 
06:36:31.830 --> 06:36:31.840 align:start position:0%
script unless there's some outrageous
 
06:36:33.910 --> 06:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
reason not to fill it but many
 
06:36:36.948 --> 06:36:36.958 align:start position:0%
pharmacists because of pressurized
 
06:36:40.310 --> 06:36:40.320 align:start position:0%
to not fulfill the script so we've
 
06:36:42.230 --> 06:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
actually spoken to the ceos of these
 
06:36:45.030 --> 06:36:45.040 align:start position:0%
companies and it is not their policy so
 
06:36:46.868 --> 06:36:46.878 align:start position:0%
theoretically if you go to a pharmacy
 
06:36:49.830 --> 06:36:49.840 align:start position:0%
and the pharmacist refuses what the ceos
 
06:36:51.750 --> 06:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
of these companies are saying is take
 
06:36:53.270 --> 06:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
down his name
 
06:36:55.670 --> 06:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
the pharmacy number and report him to
 
06:36:58.310 --> 06:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
head office because this is illegal it
 
06:37:00.548 --> 06:37:00.558 align:start position:0%
is illegal for pharmacists to practice
 
06:37:02.628 --> 06:37:02.638 align:start position:0%
medicine they do not have a medical
 
06:37:04.868 --> 06:37:04.878 align:start position:0%
license they do not need to know what
 
06:37:07.670 --> 06:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
the icd-9 code is when you get a
 
06:37:09.990 --> 06:37:10.000 align:start position:0%
prescription for
 
06:37:12.070 --> 06:37:12.080 align:start position:0%
a beta blocker the pharmacist doesn't
 
06:37:14.150 --> 06:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
ask you what's the indication why you're
 
06:37:16.548 --> 06:37:16.558 align:start position:0%
taking it he gives you the medication he
 
06:37:18.390 --> 06:37:18.400 align:start position:0%
may look to see if there are any drug
 
06:37:20.948 --> 06:37:20.958 align:start position:0%
interactions so this is an attempt by
 
06:37:23.910 --> 06:37:23.920 align:start position:0%
the pharmacies to practice medicine
 
06:37:25.830 --> 06:37:25.840 align:start position:0%
because they feel they pressurized by
 
06:37:27.190 --> 06:37:27.200 align:start position:0%
the fda
 
06:37:29.030 --> 06:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
and by the way because of this
 
06:37:29.040 --> 06:37:30.548 align:start position:0%
and by the way because of this
outrageous

06:37:30.548 --> 06:37:30.558 align:start position:0%
outrageous
 
06:37:33.190 --> 06:37:33.200 align:start position:0%
public relations stint by the fda they
 
06:37:35.910 --> 06:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
have actually reversed this statement
 
06:37:37.430 --> 06:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
about the horse
 
06:37:40.070 --> 06:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
and you're not a cow so if you go to
 
06:37:41.430 --> 06:37:41.440 align:start position:0%
their website you'll see they've
 
06:37:43.510 --> 06:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
actually changed this saying that it's
 
06:37:46.230 --> 06:37:46.240 align:start position:0%
actually permissible to use medical
 
06:37:48.788 --> 06:37:48.798 align:start position:0%
grade hypermectin but that's obviously
 
06:37:51.190 --> 06:37:51.200 align:start position:0%
not published because nobody wants to
 
06:37:53.590 --> 06:37:53.600 align:start position:0%
know about it
 
06:37:55.750 --> 06:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
06:37:58.468 --> 06:37:58.478 align:start position:0%
representative merchant
 
06:38:00.390 --> 06:38:00.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
06:38:01.990 --> 06:38:02.000 align:start position:0%
in regards to the same thing about the
 
06:38:03.990 --> 06:38:04.000 align:start position:0%
supply of the medication and being sure
 
06:38:05.430 --> 06:38:05.440 align:start position:0%
that the patient has a safe supply of
 
06:38:05.440 --> 06:38:07.750 align:start position:0%
that the patient has a safe supply of
medication

06:38:07.750 --> 06:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
medication
 
06:38:10.230 --> 06:38:10.240 align:start position:0%
many times patients in this country
 
06:38:12.150 --> 06:38:12.160 align:start position:0%
will obtain product
 
06:38:12.160 --> 06:38:13.910 align:start position:0%
will obtain product
internationally

06:38:13.910 --> 06:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
internationally
 
06:38:15.750 --> 06:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
and a lot of times it gets through the
 
06:38:18.150 --> 06:38:18.160 align:start position:0%
process of the fda and border controls
 
06:38:19.430 --> 06:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
and so forth there's only so much they
 
06:38:21.270 --> 06:38:21.280 align:start position:0%
can do to screen the thousands and
 
06:38:23.830 --> 06:38:23.840 align:start position:0%
millions of packages coming in
 
06:38:25.830 --> 06:38:25.840 align:start position:0%
in your opinion
 
06:38:27.190 --> 06:38:27.200 align:start position:0%
would it be better for the patient from
 
06:38:29.110 --> 06:38:29.120 align:start position:0%
a safety point of view to obtain
 
06:38:32.390 --> 06:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
domestic product regulated by the fda
 
06:38:34.788 --> 06:38:34.798 align:start position:0%
than to have them go internationally to
 
06:38:36.868 --> 06:38:36.878 align:start position:0%
possibly buy medication from other
 
06:38:38.468 --> 06:38:38.478 align:start position:0%
countries that don't have the same
 
06:38:40.468 --> 06:38:40.478 align:start position:0%
regulatory oversight thank you sir
 
06:38:42.310 --> 06:38:42.320 align:start position:0%
that's an absolutely outstanding
 
06:38:44.230 --> 06:38:44.240 align:start position:0%
question because as i said
 
06:38:45.830 --> 06:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
patients will do what they need to do
 
06:38:47.990 --> 06:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
they'll either use veterinary grade or
 
06:38:50.070 --> 06:38:50.080 align:start position:0%
they will go through canadian pharmacies
 
06:38:52.628 --> 06:38:52.638 align:start position:0%
and get ivamectin from india of which
 
06:38:54.948 --> 06:38:54.958 align:start position:0%
we're not sure what they're getting so
 
06:38:57.590 --> 06:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
both compounding pharmacies and and
 
06:38:59.910 --> 06:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
manufacturing pharmacies in this country
 
06:39:02.230 --> 06:39:02.240 align:start position:0%
are controlled by both state and the fda
 
06:39:05.110 --> 06:39:05.120 align:start position:0%
to ensure that the standards of
 
06:39:08.150 --> 06:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
manufacturer manufacture are correct so
 
06:39:10.628 --> 06:39:10.638 align:start position:0%
that's a very good point because
 
06:39:12.468 --> 06:39:12.478 align:start position:0%
if they can get it in the u.s then at
 
06:39:14.390 --> 06:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
least we know there's some kind of
 
06:39:16.708 --> 06:39:16.718 align:start position:0%
quality control so they know what
 
06:39:23.590 --> 06:39:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:27.510 --> 06:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much doctor thank you
 
06:39:30.948 --> 06:39:30.958 align:start position:0%
and as i said we would start with
 
06:39:33.110 --> 06:39:33.120 align:start position:0%
two individuals who would be given quite
 
06:39:35.510 --> 06:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
a bit of time sort of the champions the
 
06:39:38.548 --> 06:39:38.558 align:start position:0%
battle of the yes and the no here
 
06:39:41.750 --> 06:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
dr nick i can't quite read
 
06:39:43.990 --> 06:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
your last name but dr nick please tell
 
06:39:45.750 --> 06:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
me your last name so i'll pronounce it
 
06:39:45.760 --> 06:39:52.070 align:start position:0%
me your last name so i'll pronounce it
correctly

06:39:52.070 --> 06:39:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:54.070 --> 06:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
yeah like it says okay you see that now
 
06:39:56.150 --> 06:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
okay sorry pretty phonetic thank you
 
06:39:58.868 --> 06:39:58.878 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me to speak
 
06:39:58.878 --> 06:40:00.230 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me to speak
um

06:40:00.230 --> 06:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:40:02.708 --> 06:40:02.718 align:start position:0%
last week i believe
 
06:40:05.190 --> 06:40:05.200 align:start position:0%
you folks were able to maybe not hear
 
06:40:07.270 --> 06:40:07.280 align:start position:0%
but read a testimony submitted by my
 
06:40:09.510 --> 06:40:09.520 align:start position:0%
colleague dr randy hayes
 
06:40:13.190 --> 06:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
and it was about bill 1466 and i think
 
06:40:16.230 --> 06:40:16.240 align:start position:0%
14 66 and
 
06:40:18.868 --> 06:40:18.878 align:start position:0%
10 22 are very similar in that they talk
 
06:40:18.878 --> 06:40:20.708 align:start position:0%
10 22 are very similar in that they talk
about

06:40:20.708 --> 06:40:20.718 align:start position:0%
about
 
06:40:22.628 --> 06:40:22.638 align:start position:0%
what docs can do and what docs can't do
 
06:40:24.708 --> 06:40:24.718 align:start position:0%
basically and i'm a physician i'm not an
 
06:40:26.468 --> 06:40:26.478 align:start position:0%
expert in infectious disease
 
06:40:28.150 --> 06:40:28.160 align:start position:0%
i'm learning a lot about hypermechtum
 
06:40:30.628 --> 06:40:30.638 align:start position:0%
right now being here for the last hour
 
06:40:32.948 --> 06:40:32.958 align:start position:0%
i'm a general surgeon i've practiced in
 
06:40:35.350 --> 06:40:35.360 align:start position:0%
concord for a long time i i'm retired
 
06:40:37.350 --> 06:40:37.360 align:start position:0%
but i still teach medical students at
 
06:40:38.548 --> 06:40:38.558 align:start position:0%
from dartmouth
 
06:40:40.390 --> 06:40:40.400 align:start position:0%
three days a week
 
06:40:40.400 --> 06:40:41.830 align:start position:0%
three days a week
um

06:40:41.830 --> 06:40:41.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:40:44.070 --> 06:40:44.080 align:start position:0%
anyway uh what i'm about to talk about
 
06:40:45.990 --> 06:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
briefly and cut me off at three minutes
 
06:40:48.310 --> 06:40:48.320 align:start position:0%
please not gonna do it you're gonna okay
 
06:40:50.390 --> 06:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
equal time
 
06:40:52.230 --> 06:40:52.240 align:start position:0%
anyway uh
 
06:40:53.910 --> 06:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
i think the main reason i was asked to
 
06:40:56.788 --> 06:40:56.798 align:start position:0%
be here today was uh my experience
 
06:40:59.430 --> 06:40:59.440 align:start position:0%
my experience basically uh being a
 
06:41:01.030 --> 06:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
member of the new hampshire medical
 
06:41:01.040 --> 06:41:02.390 align:start position:0%
member of the new hampshire medical
society

06:41:02.390 --> 06:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
society
 
06:41:04.150 --> 06:41:04.160 align:start position:0%
but also being a
 
06:41:05.910 --> 06:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
participant in the board of medicine for
 
06:41:08.390 --> 06:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
over 17 years i had various physicians
 
06:41:10.310 --> 06:41:10.320 align:start position:0%
there on the board vice president of the
 
06:41:12.390 --> 06:41:12.400 align:start position:0%
board medical review subcommittee in the
 
06:41:12.400 --> 06:41:13.670 align:start position:0%
board medical review subcommittee in the
last

06:41:13.670 --> 06:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
last
 
06:41:15.510 --> 06:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
several years the last five years i was
 
06:41:17.670 --> 06:41:17.680 align:start position:0%
the physician investigator of the board
 
06:41:19.030 --> 06:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
of medicine
 
06:41:19.040 --> 06:41:19.830 align:start position:0%
of medicine
and

06:41:19.830 --> 06:41:19.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:41:21.670 --> 06:41:21.680 align:start position:0%
all i can do is tell you a little bit
 
06:41:25.110 --> 06:41:25.120 align:start position:0%
about what in reading this bill and i i
 
06:41:27.190 --> 06:41:27.200 align:start position:0%
i read the bill thinking
 
06:41:28.708 --> 06:41:28.718 align:start position:0%
a lot of this makes sense a lot of it i
 
06:41:31.190 --> 06:41:31.200 align:start position:0%
don't understand and uh in my written
 
06:41:33.510 --> 06:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
testimony what am i talking about well
 
06:41:37.110 --> 06:41:37.120 align:start position:0%
in the bill it said specifically
 
06:41:38.548 --> 06:41:38.558 align:start position:0%
the bill shall
 
06:41:40.230 --> 06:41:40.240 align:start position:0%
specify a protocol allowing the
 
06:41:42.708 --> 06:41:42.718 align:start position:0%
pharmacist to dispense ivermectin
 
06:41:45.110 --> 06:41:45.120 align:start position:0%
and she'll specify a mechanism to
 
06:41:47.110 --> 06:41:47.120 align:start position:0%
document screening performed and the
 
06:41:48.948 --> 06:41:48.958 align:start position:0%
prescription in the patient's medical
 
06:41:51.910 --> 06:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
record including a plan for evaluating
 
06:41:53.990 --> 06:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
and treating adverse events so it sounds
 
06:41:55.910 --> 06:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
like there's some kind of thing here
 
06:41:58.390 --> 06:41:58.400 align:start position:0%
other than just writing a prescription
 
06:41:58.400 --> 06:41:59.270 align:start position:0%
other than just writing a prescription
and

06:41:59.270 --> 06:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:42:01.110 --> 06:42:01.120 align:start position:0%
going to a pharmacist and if that
 
06:42:05.430 --> 06:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
wording means in my mind uh the patient
 
06:42:07.110 --> 06:42:07.120 align:start position:0%
will sign a consent
 
06:42:09.110 --> 06:42:09.120 align:start position:0%
uh that's maybe in the chart hopefully
 
06:42:10.468 --> 06:42:10.478 align:start position:0%
and make it clear that they understand
 
06:42:13.190 --> 06:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
what off label means because whether we
 
06:42:14.468 --> 06:42:14.478 align:start position:0%
like it or not it sounds like a lot of
 
06:42:15.910 --> 06:42:15.920 align:start position:0%
folks here don't like it it's still
 
06:42:17.750 --> 06:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
listed as off label if you're going to
 
06:42:20.628 --> 06:42:20.638 align:start position:0%
use it for covid
 
06:42:20.638 --> 06:42:21.430 align:start position:0%
use it for covid
and

06:42:21.430 --> 06:42:21.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:42:23.110 --> 06:42:23.120 align:start position:0%
they need to understand that and that
 
06:42:24.468 --> 06:42:24.478 align:start position:0%
signed consent needs to be in the
 
06:42:26.390 --> 06:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
patient record and the licensee will be
 
06:42:28.708 --> 06:42:28.718 align:start position:0%
monitored the outcomes will be monitored
 
06:42:31.350 --> 06:42:31.360 align:start position:0%
for any reverse effects
 
06:42:33.590 --> 06:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
and if that's the case and this
 
06:42:35.590 --> 06:42:35.600 align:start position:0%
doc gets complained about or there's a
 
06:42:37.750 --> 06:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
suit or a claim
 
06:42:39.190 --> 06:42:39.200 align:start position:0%
or a complaint
 
06:42:41.110 --> 06:42:41.120 align:start position:0%
and the board of medicine at least in my
 
06:42:43.270 --> 06:42:43.280 align:start position:0%
17 years there if the doc's doing all
 
06:42:44.948 --> 06:42:44.958 align:start position:0%
those things there's not going to be an
 
06:42:47.270 --> 06:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
issue now
 
06:42:50.150 --> 06:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
having been around a long time not
 
06:42:53.270 --> 06:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
i can't remember uh off label ever being
 
06:42:56.628 --> 06:42:56.638 align:start position:0%
a big issue at the board of medicine 17
 
06:42:59.510 --> 06:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
back in the 70s way before i even moved
 
06:43:01.590 --> 06:43:01.600 align:start position:0%
to new hampshire
 
06:43:03.350 --> 06:43:03.360 align:start position:0%
there was a case with leotrill i don't
 
06:43:04.788 --> 06:43:04.798 align:start position:0%
know if anybody's here old enough to
 
06:43:06.310 --> 06:43:06.320 align:start position:0%
remember that
 
06:43:08.070 --> 06:43:08.080 align:start position:0%
right so you folks know more than i do
 
06:43:10.310 --> 06:43:10.320 align:start position:0%
and i won't go on to it but it was past
 
06:43:11.990 --> 06:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
and then
 
06:43:12.830 --> 06:43:12.840 align:start position:0%
say that
 
06:43:16.230 --> 06:43:16.240 align:start position:0%
again yeah okay it was it was it and i
 
06:43:18.310 --> 06:43:18.320 align:start position:0%
don't think it ever became fda approved
 
06:43:19.990 --> 06:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
so whether that was label or off-label i
 
06:43:21.270 --> 06:43:21.280 align:start position:0%
don't know but
 
06:43:23.190 --> 06:43:23.200 align:start position:0%
the legislature felt that it ought to be
 
06:43:25.190 --> 06:43:25.200 align:start position:0%
available and a couple years later they
 
06:43:26.868 --> 06:43:26.878 align:start position:0%
changed their mind so that bill did
 
06:43:26.878 --> 06:43:28.390 align:start position:0%
changed their mind so that bill did
disappear

06:43:28.390 --> 06:43:28.400 align:start position:0%
disappear
 
06:43:30.788 --> 06:43:30.798 align:start position:0%
i was very involved with the off-label
 
06:43:32.708 --> 06:43:32.718 align:start position:0%
use of antibiotics that is antibiotics
 
06:43:35.030 --> 06:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
for prolonged use for lyme syndrome and
 
06:43:37.190 --> 06:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
that was back in my written testimonies
 
06:43:39.430 --> 06:43:39.440 align:start position:0%
little off it said 2013 it was actually
 
06:43:39.440 --> 06:43:41.350 align:start position:0%
little off it said 2013 it was actually
2011.

06:43:41.350 --> 06:43:41.360 align:start position:0%
2011.
 
06:43:41.360 --> 06:43:42.468 align:start position:0%
2011.
and

06:43:42.468 --> 06:43:42.478 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:43:44.708 --> 06:43:44.718 align:start position:0%
before all that got passed and even
 
06:43:46.628 --> 06:43:46.638 align:start position:0%
since then i mean i went off the board
 
06:43:48.628 --> 06:43:48.638 align:start position:0%
two years ago but there was never a
 
06:43:48.638 --> 06:43:49.750 align:start position:0%
two years ago but there was never a
complaint

06:43:49.750 --> 06:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
complaint
 
06:43:51.830 --> 06:43:51.840 align:start position:0%
or a lawsuit or a claim i mean we've had
 
06:43:53.270 --> 06:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
this law
 
06:43:55.430 --> 06:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
but i wondered what it really meant i
 
06:43:56.468 --> 06:43:56.478 align:start position:0%
mean it was
 
06:43:58.150 --> 06:43:58.160 align:start position:0%
telling docs that you can't do anything
 
06:43:59.910 --> 06:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
if you're going to order antibiotics
 
06:44:03.190 --> 06:44:03.200 align:start position:0%
long term off label for lyme disease
 
06:44:05.270 --> 06:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
this seems different i mean i'd like to
 
06:44:06.230 --> 06:44:06.240 align:start position:0%
think that we're not going to get
 
06:44:08.310 --> 06:44:08.320 align:start position:0%
complaints or lawsuits
 
06:44:10.468 --> 06:44:10.478 align:start position:0%
but i think you mentioned just six days
 
06:44:13.110 --> 06:44:13.120 align:start position:0%
ago in maine uh doc and ellsworth maine
 
06:44:14.310 --> 06:44:14.320 align:start position:0%
got uh
 
06:44:14.320 --> 06:44:15.430 align:start position:0%
got uh
um

06:44:15.430 --> 06:44:15.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:44:16.390 --> 06:44:16.400 align:start position:0%
you know
 
06:44:17.750 --> 06:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
suspended and i think she's gonna have
 
06:44:19.670 --> 06:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
to go through psychiatric evaluation it
 
06:44:21.430 --> 06:44:21.440 align:start position:0%
wasn't just
 
06:44:23.830 --> 06:44:23.840 align:start position:0%
it was multiple covert related issues
 
06:44:25.670 --> 06:44:25.680 align:start position:0%
that created the complaint so i i
 
06:44:28.150 --> 06:44:28.160 align:start position:0%
anticipate this time around the board
 
06:44:30.468 --> 06:44:30.478 align:start position:0%
will get with covet complaints lawsuits
 
06:44:31.750 --> 06:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
and claims
 
06:44:33.590 --> 06:44:33.600 align:start position:0%
it's happened in there's been discipline
 
06:44:35.270 --> 06:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
in over 20 states according to the
 
06:44:36.868 --> 06:44:36.878 align:start position:0%
federation of medical boards that's an
 
06:44:39.030 --> 06:44:39.040 align:start position:0%
organization that sort of
 
06:44:41.030 --> 06:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
your all the medical boards of all 50
 
06:44:45.510 --> 06:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
states report to so it's real and uh
 
06:44:47.750 --> 06:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
i guess in my mind what the board of
 
06:44:49.670 --> 06:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
medicine always is struggling with when
 
06:44:51.110 --> 06:44:51.120 align:start position:0%
we meet every month whether it's the
 
06:44:52.788 --> 06:44:52.798 align:start position:0%
medical review subcommittee or the board
 
06:44:54.310 --> 06:44:54.320 align:start position:0%
is what is the standard of care and
 
06:44:55.670 --> 06:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
that's that's a
 
06:44:57.350 --> 06:44:57.360 align:start position:0%
tough subject it's not
 
06:44:59.510 --> 06:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh it's not a written protocol for
 
06:44:59.520 --> 06:45:00.788 align:start position:0%
uh it's not a written protocol for
everything

06:45:00.788 --> 06:45:00.798 align:start position:0%
everything
 
06:45:03.510 --> 06:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
but when we do a complaint lawsuit or
 
06:45:06.310 --> 06:45:06.320 align:start position:0%
claim we we debate what is the standard
 
06:45:07.190 --> 06:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
of care
 
06:45:09.190 --> 06:45:09.200 align:start position:0%
amongst us here in new hampshire and
 
06:45:10.948 --> 06:45:10.958 align:start position:0%
amongst the peers
 
06:45:12.390 --> 06:45:12.400 align:start position:0%
and i'd like to believe the standard of
 
06:45:14.150 --> 06:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
care in new hampshire is that a patient
 
06:45:15.750 --> 06:45:15.760 align:start position:0%
certainly could have iramectin
 
06:45:19.110 --> 06:45:19.120 align:start position:0%
prescribed off label as long as
 
06:45:23.190 --> 06:45:23.200 align:start position:0%
that patient ideally gets put into some
 
06:45:25.110 --> 06:45:25.120 align:start position:0%
clinical trial whether it's a whether
 
06:45:27.350 --> 06:45:27.360 align:start position:0%
it's a drug company or whether it's a
 
06:45:29.190 --> 06:45:29.200 align:start position:0%
academic institution like dartmouth
 
06:45:30.948 --> 06:45:30.958 align:start position:0%
those trials do exist and they still
 
06:45:30.958 --> 06:45:32.390 align:start position:0%
those trials do exist and they still
exist

06:45:32.390 --> 06:45:32.400 align:start position:0%
exist
 
06:45:34.230 --> 06:45:34.240 align:start position:0%
and and if that were the case and all
 
06:45:35.910 --> 06:45:35.920 align:start position:0%
those other things were in order if i
 
06:45:37.910 --> 06:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
was signing a consent and so forth uh i
 
06:45:40.390 --> 06:45:40.400 align:start position:0%
don't think there'd be an issue
 
06:45:42.310 --> 06:45:42.320 align:start position:0%
but without that without any
 
06:45:44.788 --> 06:45:44.798 align:start position:0%
responsibility as to what happens when
 
06:45:46.390 --> 06:45:46.400 align:start position:0%
ordering an off-label drug i think
 
06:45:47.670 --> 06:45:47.680 align:start position:0%
there's a problem
 
06:45:49.430 --> 06:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
and the board
 
06:45:51.110 --> 06:45:51.120 align:start position:0%
i think is the right place to look that
 
06:45:52.230 --> 06:45:52.240 align:start position:0%
because that's where the standard of
 
06:45:55.270 --> 06:45:55.280 align:start position:0%
care issues are discussed and decided
 
06:45:56.948 --> 06:45:56.958 align:start position:0%
so i am opposed to this bill as it's
 
06:45:59.190 --> 06:45:59.200 align:start position:0%
written now but if it gets rewritten a
 
06:46:01.910 --> 06:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
little clearer about all those other
 
06:46:04.628 --> 06:46:04.638 align:start position:0%
issues particularly with god consent and
 
06:46:06.150 --> 06:46:06.160 align:start position:0%
and if you're not going to put the
 
06:46:08.310 --> 06:46:08.320 align:start position:0%
patient on a clinical trial you create
 
06:46:09.830 --> 06:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
something where you're keeping records
 
06:46:11.830 --> 06:46:11.840 align:start position:0%
that seem similar to that
 
06:46:13.350 --> 06:46:13.360 align:start position:0%
if you're doing that i don't think the
 
06:46:16.310 --> 06:46:16.320 align:start position:0%
board of medicine would go after you my
 
06:46:19.190 --> 06:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
last comment is basically is this all
 
06:46:21.510 --> 06:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
kind of antiquated as far as ivermectin
 
06:46:21.520 --> 06:46:22.390 align:start position:0%
kind of antiquated as far as ivermectin
and

06:46:22.390 --> 06:46:22.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:46:24.868 --> 06:46:24.878 align:start position:0%
uh the doctor here mentioned that the
 
06:46:27.910 --> 06:46:27.920 align:start position:0%
drug paxlovit is out and uh the data on
 
06:46:31.190 --> 06:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
that and its fda approved i believe on
 
06:46:33.030 --> 06:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
an emergency basis like the vaccines
 
06:46:33.040 --> 06:46:34.150 align:start position:0%
an emergency basis like the vaccines
were

06:46:34.150 --> 06:46:34.160 align:start position:0%
were
 
06:46:35.590 --> 06:46:35.600 align:start position:0%
you know if you had a patient that you
 
06:46:37.430 --> 06:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to write ivermectin on it would
 
06:46:39.030 --> 06:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
be nice that that same patient could be
 
06:46:41.190 --> 06:46:41.200 align:start position:0%
in a protocol where that ivermectin's
 
06:46:44.548 --> 06:46:44.558 align:start position:0%
response could be compared to paxlovit
 
06:46:46.468 --> 06:46:46.478 align:start position:0%
to now it's been those studies that you
 
06:46:48.150 --> 06:46:48.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned that are all over the world
 
06:46:49.510 --> 06:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
and there have been many studies looking
 
06:46:49.520 --> 06:46:50.310 align:start position:0%
and there have been many studies looking
at

06:46:50.310 --> 06:46:50.320 align:start position:0%
at
 
06:46:52.070 --> 06:46:52.080 align:start position:0%
on covet they're pretty much looking at
 
06:46:54.390 --> 06:46:54.400 align:start position:0%
it the control is basically
 
06:46:56.070 --> 06:46:56.080 align:start position:0%
placebo there isn't another drug you're
 
06:46:58.390 --> 06:46:58.400 align:start position:0%
comparing it to but now that we have
 
06:47:00.150 --> 06:47:00.160 align:start position:0%
at least in this country other drugs
 
06:47:01.750 --> 06:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
that that might be work wouldn't it be
 
06:47:04.070 --> 06:47:04.080 align:start position:0%
nice if you wanted to order ivamectin to
 
06:47:06.230 --> 06:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
get that patient on a trial
 
06:47:08.070 --> 06:47:08.080 align:start position:0%
i think that's the way to do it
 
06:47:10.548 --> 06:47:10.558 align:start position:0%
and um and that's all i really have to
 
06:47:10.558 --> 06:47:12.390 align:start position:0%
and um and that's all i really have to
say

06:47:12.390 --> 06:47:12.400 align:start position:0%
say
 
06:47:13.830 --> 06:47:13.840 align:start position:0%
thank you doctor would you take
 
06:47:13.840 --> 06:47:15.750 align:start position:0%
thank you doctor would you take
questions

06:47:15.750 --> 06:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
questions
 
06:47:17.270 --> 06:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
that again
 
06:47:20.310 --> 06:47:20.320 align:start position:0%
would you take questions sure
 
06:47:22.788 --> 06:47:22.798 align:start position:0%
i've changed over to a nine i changed
 
06:47:26.548 --> 06:47:26.558 align:start position:0%
over to the 19 mask as
 
06:47:33.670 --> 06:47:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:35.670 --> 06:47:35.680 align:start position:0%
representative acton
 
06:47:37.430 --> 06:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
all right thank you mr chair
 
06:47:40.070 --> 06:47:40.080 align:start position:0%
thank you sir for taking my question uh
 
06:47:41.750 --> 06:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
my question is related to treatment
 
06:47:44.310 --> 06:47:44.320 align:start position:0%
protocols here we are two years later
 
06:47:45.990 --> 06:47:46.000 align:start position:0%
i've had a number of complaints from
 
06:47:48.628 --> 06:47:48.638 align:start position:0%
physicians in my area saying that the
 
06:47:50.708 --> 06:47:50.718 align:start position:0%
the treatment protocols just never
 
06:47:52.948 --> 06:47:52.958 align:start position:0%
developed they didn't come out
 
06:47:55.190 --> 06:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
from from early on
 
06:47:57.750 --> 06:47:57.760 align:start position:0%
the it seemed as though the the best
 
06:47:58.788 --> 06:47:58.798 align:start position:0%
treatment was
 
06:48:00.230 --> 06:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
people were told to go to the emergency
 
06:48:03.030 --> 06:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
room told go home wait till you're
 
06:48:05.510 --> 06:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
really sick and then come back and i
 
06:48:07.510 --> 06:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
even heard people still getting that
 
06:48:07.520 --> 06:48:09.030 align:start position:0%
even heard people still getting that
advice

06:48:09.030 --> 06:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
advice
 
06:48:10.628 --> 06:48:10.638 align:start position:0%
this fall
 
06:48:12.708 --> 06:48:12.718 align:start position:0%
in your opinion why
 
06:48:15.350 --> 06:48:15.360 align:start position:0%
have there been has there been such a
 
06:48:17.110 --> 06:48:17.120 align:start position:0%
slow pace of rolling out treatment
 
06:48:19.590 --> 06:48:19.600 align:start position:0%
protocols here in new hampshire
 
06:48:21.430 --> 06:48:21.440 align:start position:0%
hopefully it's not just laziness of
 
06:48:21.440 --> 06:48:22.548 align:start position:0%
hopefully it's not just laziness of
physicians

06:48:22.548 --> 06:48:22.558 align:start position:0%
physicians
 
06:48:24.868 --> 06:48:24.878 align:start position:0%
i you know i you would hope that all
 
06:48:27.510 --> 06:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
physicians who are treating patients are
 
06:48:29.430 --> 06:48:29.440 align:start position:0%
trying to find these protocols that i'm
 
06:48:31.350 --> 06:48:31.360 align:start position:0%
that i that i believe are out there
 
06:48:33.670 --> 06:48:33.680 align:start position:0%
again i'm not an expert in this
 
06:48:33.680 --> 06:48:34.548 align:start position:0%
again i'm not an expert in this
um

06:48:34.548 --> 06:48:34.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:48:36.150 --> 06:48:36.160 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's easier just to say
 
06:48:37.830 --> 06:48:37.840 align:start position:0%
something that isn't correct and to do
 
06:48:39.990 --> 06:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
the hard work in finding the protocol
 
06:48:41.910 --> 06:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
i i don't have a direct answer to that
 
06:48:43.830 --> 06:48:43.840 align:start position:0%
but i'm fearful that that might be one
 
06:48:46.868 --> 06:48:46.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:48.708 --> 06:48:48.718 align:start position:0%
representative leon
 
06:48:50.230 --> 06:48:50.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
06:48:51.670 --> 06:48:51.680 align:start position:0%
doctor for taking the questions
 
06:48:53.510 --> 06:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
hopefully i could ask two quick
 
06:48:56.468 --> 06:48:56.478 align:start position:0%
questions um the first is in regards to
 
06:48:59.350 --> 06:48:59.360 align:start position:0%
paloxide i'm not sure are you aware that
 
06:49:01.590 --> 06:49:01.600 align:start position:0%
several drugs for sinus rhythm for
 
06:49:03.190 --> 06:49:03.200 align:start position:0%
patients with atrial fibrillation are
 
06:49:05.670 --> 06:49:05.680 align:start position:0%
highly contraindicated so especially
 
06:49:08.390 --> 06:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
anybody on amiodarone can't take it
 
06:49:10.868 --> 06:49:10.878 align:start position:0%
no i don't okay i'm not aware then again
 
06:49:12.230 --> 06:49:12.240 align:start position:0%
as a journalist again i'm a retired
 
06:49:14.548 --> 06:49:14.558 align:start position:0%
general surgeon yes thank you
 
06:49:16.390 --> 06:49:16.400 align:start position:0%
and the other question is when are
 
06:49:18.310 --> 06:49:18.320 align:start position:0%
looking to collect data i don't know who
 
06:49:20.788 --> 06:49:20.798 align:start position:0%
would pay for a large pharmaceutical
 
06:49:22.708 --> 06:49:22.718 align:start position:0%
style study or an academic one
 
06:49:24.548 --> 06:49:24.558 align:start position:0%
especially with the one-to-one overhead
 
06:49:26.628 --> 06:49:26.638 align:start position:0%
from places like dartmouth
 
06:49:28.150 --> 06:49:28.160 align:start position:0%
what a registry
 
06:49:30.150 --> 06:49:30.160 align:start position:0%
where where the information was just
 
06:49:30.160 --> 06:49:31.350 align:start position:0%
where where the information was just
collected

06:49:31.350 --> 06:49:31.360 align:start position:0%
collected
 
06:49:33.910 --> 06:49:33.920 align:start position:0%
sort of a very lightweight swedish model
 
06:49:36.708 --> 06:49:36.718 align:start position:0%
be sufficient to find any large signals
 
06:49:39.990 --> 06:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
of risk or benefit and then generate a
 
06:49:41.910 --> 06:49:41.920 align:start position:0%
hypothesis for a true clinical trial
 
06:49:41.920 --> 06:49:43.670 align:start position:0%
hypothesis for a true clinical trial
later

06:49:43.670 --> 06:49:43.680 align:start position:0%
later
 
06:49:45.590 --> 06:49:45.600 align:start position:0%
i totally agree that patients shouldn't
 
06:49:47.830 --> 06:49:47.840 align:start position:0%
be involved paying out of pocket to be
 
06:49:49.670 --> 06:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
in a clinical trial that that to me is
 
06:49:51.510 --> 06:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
unethical because you're making the
 
06:49:53.110 --> 06:49:53.120 align:start position:0%
effort to
 
06:49:54.708 --> 06:49:54.718 align:start position:0%
share your information what's happened
 
06:49:55.830 --> 06:49:55.840 align:start position:0%
to you
 
06:49:55.840 --> 06:49:56.708 align:start position:0%
to you
um

06:49:56.708 --> 06:49:56.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:49:58.310 --> 06:49:58.320 align:start position:0%
yeah i think a registry would be better
 
06:49:59.910 --> 06:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
than nothing
 
06:49:59.920 --> 06:50:01.270 align:start position:0%
than nothing
and

06:50:01.270 --> 06:50:01.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:50:02.390 --> 06:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
but i'd like to believe there aren't
 
06:50:03.910 --> 06:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
that many obstacles that get into a
 
06:50:08.310 --> 06:50:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:13.750 --> 06:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:15.430 --> 06:50:15.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much sir
 
06:50:17.670 --> 06:50:17.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:50:21.030 --> 06:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
now we are going into our three minutes
 
06:50:22.948 --> 06:50:22.958 align:start position:0%
have you found a nasty three-minute
 
06:50:25.590 --> 06:50:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:27.750 --> 06:50:27.760 align:start position:0%
i believe i have let me give it to you
 
06:50:30.310 --> 06:50:30.320 align:start position:0%
is uh two seconds
 
06:50:31.750 --> 06:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
well no you're going to take the blame
 
06:50:42.708 --> 06:50:42.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:44.788 --> 06:50:44.798 align:start position:0%
that is nasty enough for our purposes

and how i believe ivermectin actually
 
06:51:52.868 --> 06:51:52.878 align:start position:0%
saved me in the beginning of november i
 
06:51:54.948 --> 06:51:54.958 align:start position:0%
was notified that i had been exposed to
 
06:51:57.750 --> 06:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
uh the cyrus cov2 virus i began watching
 
06:52:00.150 --> 06:52:00.160 align:start position:0%
for symptoms and very soon after that i
 
06:52:01.990 --> 06:52:02.000 align:start position:0%
tested positive through a pcr test from
 
06:52:03.270 --> 06:52:03.280 align:start position:0%
my doctor
 
06:52:06.390 --> 06:52:06.400 align:start position:0%
i was given instruction to go home
 
06:52:08.788 --> 06:52:08.798 align:start position:0%
i was quarantined for at least 10 days
 
06:52:10.310 --> 06:52:10.320 align:start position:0%
and that if my symptoms became
 
06:52:12.390 --> 06:52:12.400 align:start position:0%
threatening to go to the emergency room
 
06:52:14.708 --> 06:52:14.718 align:start position:0%
do not show up at the office
 
06:52:16.948 --> 06:52:16.958 align:start position:0%
i was also not offered any type of
 
06:52:18.788 --> 06:52:18.798 align:start position:0%
prescription no type of treatment
 
06:52:21.110 --> 06:52:21.120 align:start position:0%
whatsoever from the doctor
 
06:52:23.430 --> 06:52:23.440 align:start position:0%

06:52:24.868 --> 06:52:24.878 align:start position:0%
type of instruction of any type of
 
06:52:26.948 --> 06:52:26.958 align:start position:0%
over-the-counter medicine that i could
 
06:52:28.548 --> 06:52:28.558 align:start position:0%
assist that could assist me with the
 
06:52:30.310 --> 06:52:30.320 align:start position:0%
infection although i thought it was
 
06:52:33.270 --> 06:52:33.280 align:start position:0%
really bad that my doctor would not help
 
06:52:35.990 --> 06:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
me in because i was sick
 
06:52:38.070 --> 06:52:38.080 align:start position:0%
that evening i became very ill and after
 
06:52:40.708 --> 06:52:40.718 align:start position:0%
two days of being home with me
 
06:52:43.510 --> 06:52:43.520 align:start position:0%
quarantining my partner also became very
 
06:52:43.520 --> 06:52:44.788 align:start position:0%
quarantining my partner also became very
ill

06:52:44.788 --> 06:52:44.798 align:start position:0%
ill
 
06:52:46.468 --> 06:52:46.478 align:start position:0%
on the night of day two i was running a
 
06:52:49.190 --> 06:52:49.200 align:start position:0%
fever of 103.6
 
06:52:51.350 --> 06:52:51.360 align:start position:0%
i had horrendous body aches and i needed
 
06:52:52.788 --> 06:52:52.798 align:start position:0%
assistance just to walk to the
 
06:52:52.798 --> 06:52:54.708 align:start position:0%
assistance just to walk to the
facilities

06:52:54.708 --> 06:52:54.718 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
06:52:56.788 --> 06:52:56.798 align:start position:0%
that was a rough night and the next day
 
06:52:58.948 --> 06:52:58.958 align:start position:0%
was no better but fortunately there was
 
06:53:00.628 --> 06:53:00.638 align:start position:0%
a knock on my door
 
06:53:02.548 --> 06:53:02.558 align:start position:0%
from someone that i knew who i now
 
06:53:05.350 --> 06:53:05.360 align:start position:0%
consider an angel
 
06:53:07.270 --> 06:53:07.280 align:start position:0%
that friend placed an envelope on my
 
06:53:08.708 --> 06:53:08.718 align:start position:0%
doorstep and inside was a note
 
06:53:10.868 --> 06:53:10.878 align:start position:0%
describing where i could do a telehealth
 
06:53:10.878 --> 06:53:11.990 align:start position:0%
describing where i could do a telehealth
appointment

06:53:11.990 --> 06:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
appointment
 
06:53:15.030 --> 06:53:15.040 align:start position:0%
uh to have iber ivremechten prescribed
 
06:53:16.868 --> 06:53:16.878 align:start position:0%
and immediately with the assistance from
 
06:53:18.548 --> 06:53:18.558 align:start position:0%
my partner i went online and went
 
06:53:20.468 --> 06:53:20.478 align:start position:0%
through the telehealth process and a
 
06:53:23.110 --> 06:53:23.120 align:start position:0%
doctor prescribed me the ivormectin and
 
06:53:25.270 --> 06:53:25.280 align:start position:0%
it was shipped to me overnight arrived
 
06:53:27.510 --> 06:53:27.520 align:start position:0%
the next morning about 11 am
 
06:53:29.190 --> 06:53:29.200 align:start position:0%
now at this point both my partner and i
 
06:53:30.788 --> 06:53:30.798 align:start position:0%
were extremely sick
 
06:53:32.310 --> 06:53:32.320 align:start position:0%
so sick that we had talked about going
 
06:53:34.468 --> 06:53:34.478 align:start position:0%
to the hospital but we decided we'd
 
06:53:36.868 --> 06:53:36.878 align:start position:0%
rather take our chances at home we
 
06:53:38.548 --> 06:53:38.558 align:start position:0%
literally made our peace with each other
 
06:53:40.708 --> 06:53:40.718 align:start position:0%
and our creator and asked that he watch
 
06:53:42.310 --> 06:53:42.320 align:start position:0%
over us
 
06:53:44.390 --> 06:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
we both took the ivermectin and
 
06:53:46.868 --> 06:53:46.878 align:start position:0%
amazingly about three hours later for
 
06:53:49.510 --> 06:53:49.520 align:start position:0%
both of us our fever broke
 
06:53:52.390 --> 06:53:52.400 align:start position:0%
our body aches left completely but we
 
06:53:55.030 --> 06:53:55.040 align:start position:0%
were still very sick
 
06:53:56.788 --> 06:53:56.798 align:start position:0%
we continued the ivermectin use as
 
06:53:58.868 --> 06:53:58.878 align:start position:0%
prescribed by our doctor which was also
 
06:54:02.150 --> 06:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
following the flccc guidelines
 
06:54:04.310 --> 06:54:04.320 align:start position:0%
uh for ivermectin use for the covet 19
 
06:54:04.320 --> 06:54:05.430 align:start position:0%
uh for ivermectin use for the covet 19
patients

06:54:05.430 --> 06:54:05.440 align:start position:0%
patients
 
06:54:07.350 --> 06:54:07.360 align:start position:0%
each day we got better and better we
 
06:54:08.868 --> 06:54:08.878 align:start position:0%
still experienced many of the same
 
06:54:10.230 --> 06:54:10.240 align:start position:0%
symptoms as other patients would
 
06:54:12.070 --> 06:54:12.080 align:start position:0%
experience but i believe the ivramecten
 
06:54:14.548 --> 06:54:14.558 align:start position:0%
was the saving grace or medication
 
06:54:16.150 --> 06:54:16.160 align:start position:0%
in our illnesses
 
06:54:17.670 --> 06:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
because we were so sick and i knew there
 
06:54:19.110 --> 06:54:19.120 align:start position:0%
could be a chance of contracting the
 
06:54:20.390 --> 06:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
disease again
 
06:54:21.750 --> 06:54:21.760 align:start position:0%
i acquired another prescription of
 
06:54:23.670 --> 06:54:23.680 align:start position:0%
ivermectin for us to have on hand a
 
06:54:24.868 --> 06:54:24.878 align:start position:0%
larger one
 
06:54:26.948 --> 06:54:26.958 align:start position:0%
we both tested negative 12 days after
 
06:54:28.708 --> 06:54:28.718 align:start position:0%
infection however we still dealt with
 
06:54:31.190 --> 06:54:31.200 align:start position:0%
the residual effects of the disease
 
06:54:34.150 --> 06:54:34.160 align:start position:0%
i had researched the flccc protocols
 
06:54:35.670 --> 06:54:35.680 align:start position:0%
for post covenant infections and
 
06:54:37.750 --> 06:54:37.760 align:start position:0%
continued at a reduced dosage as
 
06:54:37.760 --> 06:54:39.190 align:start position:0%
continued at a reduced dosage as
instructed

06:54:39.190 --> 06:54:39.200 align:start position:0%
instructed
 
06:54:40.948 --> 06:54:40.958 align:start position:0%
during the holidays we decided to travel
 
06:54:42.548 --> 06:54:42.558 align:start position:0%
to our vacation home in the us virgin
 
06:54:42.558 --> 06:54:43.510 align:start position:0%
to our vacation home in the us virgin
islands

06:54:43.510 --> 06:54:43.520 align:start position:0%
islands
 
06:54:45.910 --> 06:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
we tested negative and we traveled a
 
06:54:47.750 --> 06:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
week prior to travel we increased our
 
06:54:50.628 --> 06:54:50.638 align:start position:0%
dosage of ivermectin
 
06:54:52.788 --> 06:54:52.798 align:start position:0%
for protection and during our stay we
 
06:54:55.670 --> 06:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
took iv we took ivermectin daily
 
06:54:57.670 --> 06:54:57.680 align:start position:0%
omicron was beginning to move rampant
 
06:54:59.350 --> 06:54:59.360 align:start position:0%
through the island at this point there
 
06:55:01.830 --> 06:55:01.840 align:start position:0%
were 127 cases on the island when we
 
06:55:04.548 --> 06:55:04.558 align:start position:0%
arrived 10 days later there were 1300
 
06:55:04.558 --> 06:55:06.390 align:start position:0%
arrived 10 days later there were 1300
cases

06:55:06.390 --> 06:55:06.400 align:start position:0%
cases
 
06:55:07.670 --> 06:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
we were
 
06:55:09.430 --> 06:55:09.440 align:start position:0%
around hundreds of people
 
06:55:12.070 --> 06:55:12.080 align:start position:0%
on island in the airports and on the
 
06:55:12.080 --> 06:55:13.510 align:start position:0%
on island in the airports and on the
plane

06:55:13.510 --> 06:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
plane
 
06:55:16.150 --> 06:55:16.160 align:start position:0%
when we came home we stopped our ivory
 
06:55:17.590 --> 06:55:17.600 align:start position:0%
meccan protocol
 
06:55:19.590 --> 06:55:19.600 align:start position:0%
and five days later i was exposed to the
 
06:55:22.150 --> 06:55:22.160 align:start position:0%
omicron variant and i became ill and
 
06:55:24.548 --> 06:55:24.558 align:start position:0%
tested positive once again
 
06:55:26.468 --> 06:55:26.478 align:start position:0%
uh why didn't i just keep taking the po
 
06:55:28.628 --> 06:55:28.638 align:start position:0%
po the post uh coveted protocol i don't
 
06:55:30.628 --> 06:55:30.638 align:start position:0%
know i just i had just stopped
 
06:55:32.788 --> 06:55:32.798 align:start position:0%
um i'm happy i had the ivermectin on
 
06:55:34.468 --> 06:55:34.478 align:start position:0%
hand i only had two and a half days of
 
06:55:36.708 --> 06:55:36.718 align:start position:0%
fever one tough day and then the virus
 
06:55:39.270 --> 06:55:39.280 align:start position:0%
presented itself as a nasty cold i
 
06:55:41.510 --> 06:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
tested negative day on day six seven and
 
06:55:44.150 --> 06:55:44.160 align:start position:0%
eight now i'm here testifying before you
 
06:55:45.990 --> 06:55:46.000 align:start position:0%
that was very recent i am negative i
 
06:55:48.070 --> 06:55:48.080 align:start position:0%
tested negative this morning
 
06:55:49.910 --> 06:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
i truly believe uh had i not been
 
06:55:51.510 --> 06:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
following the ivermectin protocol the
 
06:55:53.350 --> 06:55:53.360 align:start position:0%
illness in both respects would have
 
06:55:55.110 --> 06:55:55.120 align:start position:0%
would have and could have been much
 
06:55:55.120 --> 06:55:56.070 align:start position:0%
would have and could have been much
worse

06:55:56.070 --> 06:55:56.080 align:start position:0%
worse
 
06:55:57.590 --> 06:55:57.600 align:start position:0%
our doctors would not prescribe us
 
06:55:58.868 --> 06:55:58.878 align:start position:0%
anything we were left to our own
 
06:56:01.190 --> 06:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
defenses we ordered all of the vitamin
 
06:56:02.708 --> 06:56:02.718 align:start position:0%
supplements that our research determined
 
06:56:05.510 --> 06:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
we should use d3k2 sequest and bromelain
 
06:56:07.590 --> 06:56:07.600 align:start position:0%
zinc copper it was a pill fest every
 
06:56:07.600 --> 06:56:08.708 align:start position:0%
zinc copper it was a pill fest every
morning

06:56:08.708 --> 06:56:08.718 align:start position:0%
morning
 
06:56:12.708 --> 06:56:12.718 align:start position:0%
you do what you have to do to stay well
 
06:56:14.070 --> 06:56:14.080 align:start position:0%
we took that along with our dose of
 
06:56:16.070 --> 06:56:16.080 align:start position:0%
ivermecnus prescribed following the
 
06:56:18.468 --> 06:56:18.478 align:start position:0%
flccc guidelines
 
06:56:20.230 --> 06:56:20.240 align:start position:0%
my partner
 
06:56:21.750 --> 06:56:21.760 align:start position:0%
by the way i will be visiting my local
 
06:56:23.270 --> 06:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
doctor regularly for lung checks and
 
06:56:24.468 --> 06:56:24.478 align:start position:0%
blood work
 
06:56:26.708 --> 06:56:26.718 align:start position:0%
my partner and i both have autoimmune
 
06:56:26.718 --> 06:56:28.708 align:start position:0%
my partner and i both have autoimmune
diseases

06:56:28.708 --> 06:56:28.718 align:start position:0%
diseases
 
06:56:30.628 --> 06:56:30.638 align:start position:0%
30 seconds autoimmune diseases that will
 
06:56:32.788 --> 06:56:32.798 align:start position:0%
not allow us to take the vaccine
 
06:56:34.868 --> 06:56:34.878 align:start position:0%
therefore we must be allowed to and be
 
06:56:36.868 --> 06:56:36.878 align:start position:0%
involved with a post-covet protocol to
 
06:56:38.708 --> 06:56:38.718 align:start position:0%
keep ourselves safe
 
06:56:40.468 --> 06:56:40.478 align:start position:0%
from the virus during the duration of
 
06:56:42.548 --> 06:56:42.558 align:start position:0%
this pandemic and we both believe that
 
06:56:44.310 --> 06:56:44.320 align:start position:0%
ivormectin is the protocol we choose to
 
06:56:45.990 --> 06:56:46.000 align:start position:0%
follow i'm a firm believer that
 
06:56:47.670 --> 06:56:47.680 align:start position:0%
thyrobectin is a drug that can assist
 
06:56:49.430 --> 06:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
with the weakening of the virus allowing
 
06:56:50.628 --> 06:56:50.638 align:start position:0%
the patient to be able to work through
 
06:56:52.708 --> 06:56:52.718 align:start position:0%
the disease and infection much much
 
06:56:55.350 --> 06:56:55.360 align:start position:0%
easier i have provided my testimony to
 
06:56:58.468 --> 06:56:58.478 align:start position:0%
you in writing i've also provided to you
 
06:57:01.350 --> 06:57:01.360 align:start position:0%
the flccc guidelines for avermectin used
 
06:57:03.430 --> 06:57:03.440 align:start position:0%
for covet 19 along with the report i
 
06:57:05.670 --> 06:57:05.680 align:start position:0%
gave you the link as well and i also
 
06:57:07.750 --> 06:57:07.760 align:start position:0%
gave you a report from the miracle
 
06:57:10.230 --> 06:57:10.240 align:start position:0%
journal of therapeutics where they've
 
06:57:11.910 --> 06:57:11.920 align:start position:0%
reviewed the emerging of evidence
 
06:57:13.750 --> 06:57:13.760 align:start position:0%
demonstrating the efficacy of ivermectin
 
06:57:15.030 --> 06:57:15.040 align:start position:0%
and the prophylaxis and treatment of
 
06:57:17.270 --> 06:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
cover 19. you have that report from me
 
06:57:18.948 --> 06:57:18.958 align:start position:0%
and the link to that as well
 
06:57:20.788 --> 06:57:20.798 align:start position:0%
i also want to say one last statement
 
06:57:22.708 --> 06:57:22.718 align:start position:0%
that i do not believe the state has any
 
06:57:24.310 --> 06:57:24.320 align:start position:0%
right to step between a doctor and a
 
06:57:27.270 --> 06:57:27.280 align:start position:0%
patient where their um where prescribing
 
06:57:29.910 --> 06:57:29.920 align:start position:0%
medicine is is concerned uh and i also
 
06:57:32.548 --> 06:57:32.558 align:start position:0%
think that because this this uh medicine
 
06:57:33.750 --> 06:57:33.760 align:start position:0%
is is
 
06:57:35.590 --> 06:57:35.600 align:start position:0%
well known all over the world and is
 
06:57:37.670 --> 06:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
sold over the counter in many countries
 
06:57:39.270 --> 06:57:39.280 align:start position:0%
it should be also sold over the counter
 
06:57:40.868 --> 06:57:40.878 align:start position:0%
here thank you very much thank you
 
06:57:40.878 --> 06:57:46.230 align:start position:0%
here thank you very much thank you
representative

06:57:46.230 --> 06:57:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:47.910 --> 06:57:47.920 align:start position:0%
and to balance
 
06:57:49.750 --> 06:57:49.760 align:start position:0%
another representative
 
06:57:53.190 --> 06:57:53.200 align:start position:0%
our own doctor jerry kanerk who has 25
 
06:57:54.788 --> 06:57:54.798 align:start position:0%
copies of
 
06:57:54.798 --> 06:57:57.270 align:start position:0%
copies of
something

06:57:57.270 --> 06:57:57.280 align:start position:0%
something
 
06:57:59.030 --> 06:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
has he passed them out yes yes i've
 
06:58:00.548 --> 06:58:00.558 align:start position:0%
already passed them out that's what that
 
06:58:03.110 --> 06:58:03.120 align:start position:0%
is okay i see it and thank you
 
06:58:04.948 --> 06:58:04.958 align:start position:0%
may i ask for maybe just a little bit
 
06:58:06.230 --> 06:58:06.240 align:start position:0%
more than three minutes because i was
 
06:58:08.468 --> 06:58:08.478 align:start position:0%
asked by some people to uh to explain
 
06:58:10.788 --> 06:58:10.798 align:start position:0%
the protocols of three minutes plus the
 
06:58:10.798 --> 06:58:12.628 align:start position:0%
the protocols of three minutes plus the
overrun

06:58:12.628 --> 06:58:12.638 align:start position:0%
overrun
 
06:58:14.468 --> 06:58:14.478 align:start position:0%
i'll do my best i'll i'll motor mouth
 
06:58:16.628 --> 06:58:16.638 align:start position:0%
and i've already cut a bunch of stuff um
 
06:58:18.390 --> 06:58:18.400 align:start position:0%
so anyway yes for the record jerry caner
 
06:58:20.310 --> 06:58:20.320 align:start position:0%
carroll county district three
 
06:58:21.910 --> 06:58:21.920 align:start position:0%
um we're really not here to discuss
 
06:58:23.430 --> 06:58:23.440 align:start position:0%
whether or not ivermectin is good or bad
 
06:58:25.830 --> 06:58:25.840 align:start position:0%
we're here to discuss its use in covid
 
06:58:27.510 --> 06:58:27.520 align:start position:0%
the decision to use in medicine or
 
06:58:29.110 --> 06:58:29.120 align:start position:0%
surgical intervention is based upon an
 
06:58:30.628 --> 06:58:30.638 align:start position:0%
analysis of the risks and the benefits
 
06:58:32.230 --> 06:58:32.240 align:start position:0%
of the proposed procedure
 
06:58:34.708 --> 06:58:34.718 align:start position:0%
or intervention to treat a specific
 
06:58:36.390 --> 06:58:36.400 align:start position:0%
clinical diagnosis using the best
 
06:58:38.070 --> 06:58:38.080 align:start position:0%
available evidence if there's clear
 
06:58:39.990 --> 06:58:40.000 align:start position:0%
benefit with a low risk profile then it
 
06:58:41.830 --> 06:58:41.840 align:start position:0%
sounds like a good intervention
 
06:58:43.350 --> 06:58:43.360 align:start position:0%
now you've all received a bunch of
 
06:58:45.510 --> 06:58:45.520 align:start position:0%
emails and we just heard a couple of
 
06:58:48.548 --> 06:58:48.558 align:start position:0%
testimonials about how
 
06:58:49.830 --> 06:58:49.840 align:start position:0%
people took some covet and they got
 
06:58:49.840 --> 06:58:50.708 align:start position:0%
people took some covet and they got
better

06:58:50.708 --> 06:58:50.718 align:start position:0%
better
 
06:58:53.190 --> 06:58:53.200 align:start position:0%
but those are anecdotes they're not data
 
06:58:54.788 --> 06:58:54.798 align:start position:0%
they mean nothing since actually most
 
06:58:57.430 --> 06:58:57.440 align:start position:0%
people who get coveted will recover
 
06:58:59.030 --> 06:58:59.040 align:start position:0%
so determining the risks and benefits
 
06:59:00.788 --> 06:59:00.798 align:start position:0%
require really well-designed studies
 
06:59:03.270 --> 06:59:03.280 align:start position:0%
analyzed by investigators free of
 
06:59:05.430 --> 06:59:05.440 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest and that
 
06:59:07.590 --> 06:59:07.600 align:start position:0%
analysis requires a very high level of
 
06:59:09.510 --> 06:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
study and knowledge of study design i'm
 
06:59:11.590 --> 06:59:11.600 align:start position:0%
sorry i'm trying to read too fast many
 
06:59:13.190 --> 06:59:13.200 align:start position:0%
studies look compelling upon further
 
06:59:16.230 --> 06:59:16.240 align:start position:0%
analysis have design flaws don't apply
 
06:59:17.990 --> 06:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
have study groups too small don't reach
 
06:59:20.628 --> 06:59:20.638 align:start position:0%
significance or not reproducible
 
06:59:22.948 --> 06:59:22.958 align:start position:0%
bottom line ivermectin does have clear
 
06:59:24.788 --> 06:59:24.798 align:start position:0%
benefit for certain indications such as
 
06:59:26.868 --> 06:59:26.878 align:start position:0%
treating parasitic worms and even some
 
06:59:29.270 --> 06:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
external parasites the risk for a file
 
06:59:31.110 --> 06:59:31.120 align:start position:0%
is indeed rather small with appropriate
 
06:59:33.030 --> 06:59:33.040 align:start position:0%
doses and that's already been covered
 
06:59:35.270 --> 06:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
the rationale for using ivermectin and
 
06:59:37.350 --> 06:59:37.360 align:start position:0%
covet is based on its ability to inhibit
 
06:59:40.310 --> 06:59:40.320 align:start position:0%
these uh saris covalent virus ii in cell
 
06:59:42.070 --> 06:59:42.080 align:start position:0%
cultures but that doesn't necessarily
 
06:59:43.910 --> 06:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
predict success in a clinical setting
 
06:59:45.750 --> 06:59:45.760 align:start position:0%
because that's a whole different thing
 
06:59:47.030 --> 06:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
numerous clinical studies has been
 
06:59:49.270 --> 06:59:49.280 align:start position:0%
published with conflicting results but
 
06:59:51.350 --> 06:59:51.360 align:start position:0%
most ivermectin studies published so far
 
06:59:52.948 --> 06:59:52.958 align:start position:0%
and this has been well
 
06:59:54.868 --> 06:59:54.878 align:start position:0%
analyzed by a number of different groups
 
06:59:57.430 --> 06:59:57.440 align:start position:0%
the cochrane collaboration the fda a
 
06:59:58.628 --> 06:59:58.638 align:start position:0%
number of different groups have looked
 
07:00:01.510 --> 07:00:01.520 align:start position:0%
at it most are limited by two smaller
 
07:00:04.070 --> 07:00:04.080 align:start position:0%
sample sizes non-blinding the use of
 
07:00:05.830 --> 07:00:05.840 align:start position:0%
concomitant medications that confound
 
07:00:07.030 --> 07:00:07.040 align:start position:0%
the assessment
 
07:00:08.788 --> 07:00:08.798 align:start position:0%
or poorly defined study groups and
 
07:00:11.030 --> 07:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
outcome measures even the well-designed
 
07:00:12.310 --> 07:00:12.320 align:start position:0%
studies have
 
07:00:14.070 --> 07:00:14.080 align:start position:0%
quite marked limitations such that
 
07:00:16.310 --> 07:00:16.320 align:start position:0%
definitive conclusions regarding the
 
07:00:18.390 --> 07:00:18.400 align:start position:0%
clinical efficacy of ivermectin in the
 
07:00:21.430 --> 07:00:21.440 align:start position:0%
treatment of covid cannot yet be reached
 
07:00:23.590 --> 07:00:23.600 align:start position:0%
so as an example as representative nunus
 
07:00:25.590 --> 07:00:25.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned he distributed a meta-analysis
 
07:00:27.110 --> 07:00:27.120 align:start position:0%
by bryant
 
07:00:29.190 --> 07:00:29.200 align:start position:0%
if you look on page e442 that
 
07:00:31.270 --> 07:00:31.280 align:start position:0%
demonstrates the quality of endpoint
 
07:00:32.708 --> 07:00:32.718 align:start position:0%
quality of evidence for the various
 
07:00:35.510 --> 07:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
endpoints so again that's in your emails
 
07:00:36.868 --> 07:00:36.878 align:start position:0%
and you'll find that the quality of
 
07:00:38.868 --> 07:00:38.878 align:start position:0%
evidence was very low for seven of the
 
07:00:41.110 --> 07:00:41.120 align:start position:0%
endpoints low for four and moderate for
 
07:00:41.120 --> 07:00:41.990 align:start position:0%
endpoints low for four and moderate for
one

07:00:41.990 --> 07:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
one
 
07:00:43.670 --> 07:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
that's not a really compelling set of
 
07:00:43.680 --> 07:00:44.708 align:start position:0%
that's not a really compelling set of
data

07:00:44.708 --> 07:00:44.718 align:start position:0%
data
 
07:00:47.030 --> 07:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
and the one that was moderate was uh
 
07:00:48.788 --> 07:00:48.798 align:start position:0%
based substantially on the paper from
 
07:00:50.390 --> 07:00:50.400 align:start position:0%
egypt by al-gazar which was later
 
07:00:51.830 --> 07:00:51.840 align:start position:0%
retracted when it was found to be
 
07:00:51.840 --> 07:00:53.510 align:start position:0%
retracted when it was found to be
fraudulent

07:00:53.510 --> 07:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
fraudulent
 
07:00:55.030 --> 07:00:55.040 align:start position:0%
if we look at the paper that was just
 
07:00:56.868 --> 07:00:56.878 align:start position:0%
distributed to us this morning that's
 
07:00:59.510 --> 07:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
this one here by kerr it really doesn't
 
07:01:01.110 --> 07:01:01.120 align:start position:0%
take very long to actually realize that
 
07:01:03.350 --> 07:01:03.360 align:start position:0%
this is also not a great paper because
 
07:01:05.510 --> 07:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
as you look at either the beginning of
 
07:01:07.750 --> 07:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
the second paragraph or in the study
 
07:01:09.350 --> 07:01:09.360 align:start position:0%
procedures and data collection on the
 
07:01:10.468 --> 07:01:10.478 align:start position:0%
third page
 
07:01:12.310 --> 07:01:12.320 align:start position:0%
it talks about the fact that this is an
 
07:01:14.708 --> 07:01:14.718 align:start position:0%
optional voluntary prophylactic use of
 
07:01:16.390 --> 07:01:16.400 align:start position:0%
ivermectin offered to patients during
 
07:01:18.390 --> 07:01:18.400 align:start position:0%
medical visits in other words it's not
 
07:01:18.400 --> 07:01:19.670 align:start position:0%
medical visits in other words it's not
randomized

07:01:19.670 --> 07:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
randomized
 
07:01:21.830 --> 07:01:21.840 align:start position:0%
that's not a good way to do a drug study
 
07:01:23.510 --> 07:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
so you know you can read through all of
 
07:01:25.350 --> 07:01:25.360 align:start position:0%
it it looks really impressive but it's
 
07:01:27.510 --> 07:01:27.520 align:start position:0%
not got good data
 
07:01:29.510 --> 07:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
so currently the best i will it's not
 
07:01:30.788 --> 07:01:30.798 align:start position:0%
too much longer currently the best
 
07:01:32.390 --> 07:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
available evidence doesn't show that
 
07:01:34.628 --> 07:01:34.638 align:start position:0%
ivermectin is effective against covet 19
 
07:01:36.310 --> 07:01:36.320 align:start position:0%
and there are numerous ongoing clinical
 
07:01:38.788 --> 07:01:38.798 align:start position:0%
trials the infectious disease society of
 
07:01:40.310 --> 07:01:40.320 align:start position:0%
america does recommend the use of
 
07:01:42.708 --> 07:01:42.718 align:start position:0%
ivermectin only in the context of
 
07:01:44.628 --> 07:01:44.638 align:start position:0%
clinical trials until we have better
 
07:01:44.638 --> 07:01:46.070 align:start position:0%
clinical trials until we have better
data

07:01:46.070 --> 07:01:46.080 align:start position:0%
data
 
07:01:47.510 --> 07:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
the point is a standing order with a
 
07:01:49.030 --> 07:01:49.040 align:start position:0%
pharmacist should never be used for
 
07:01:51.190 --> 07:01:51.200 align:start position:0%
medications being used for indications
 
07:01:52.948 --> 07:01:52.958 align:start position:0%
that are not clearly supported by the
 
07:01:55.030 --> 07:01:55.040 align:start position:0%
best available medical evidence
 
07:01:57.110 --> 07:01:57.120 align:start position:0%
ivermectin doesn't reach this level as a
 
07:01:59.510 --> 07:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
result the bill should be voted itl or
 
07:02:01.350 --> 07:02:01.360 align:start position:0%
if it goes forward the standing order
 
07:02:02.628 --> 07:02:02.638 align:start position:0%
should include a disclosure that the
 
07:02:04.468 --> 07:02:04.478 align:start position:0%
best available evidence does not support
 
07:02:06.390 --> 07:02:06.400 align:start position:0%
its use for covid
 
07:02:07.670 --> 07:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
i do want to take a moment though just
 
07:02:09.510 --> 07:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
to reflect on some of the things that
 
07:02:11.030 --> 07:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
were stated
 
07:02:11.040 --> 07:02:11.830 align:start position:0%
were stated
by

07:02:11.830 --> 07:02:11.840 align:start position:0%
by
 
07:02:13.350 --> 07:02:13.360 align:start position:0%
dr merrick
 
07:02:15.670 --> 07:02:15.680 align:start position:0%
he commented about the vares reports and
 
07:02:17.510 --> 07:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
the 20 000 people died
 
07:02:18.548 --> 07:02:18.558 align:start position:0%
those of you been around here for a
 
07:02:20.628 --> 07:02:20.638 align:start position:0%
while know that the vares is a reporting
 
07:02:20.638 --> 07:02:21.590 align:start position:0%
while know that the vares is a reporting
system

07:02:21.590 --> 07:02:21.600 align:start position:0%
system
 
07:02:23.430 --> 07:02:23.440 align:start position:0%
of any adverse effect
 
07:02:25.910 --> 07:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
you are required to report any death
 
07:02:27.750 --> 07:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether it is causal so if
 
07:02:30.230 --> 07:02:30.240 align:start position:0%
i get in a vaccine and i get run over by
 
07:02:32.310 --> 07:02:32.320 align:start position:0%
a car two days later and somebody knows
 
07:02:35.750 --> 07:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
about it that must be reported
 
07:02:37.430 --> 07:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
if you look at the disclaimer on this on
 
07:02:40.628 --> 07:02:40.638 align:start position:0%
the cdc site it says very clearly that a
 
07:02:42.628 --> 07:02:42.638 align:start position:0%
report in varus does not indicate that
 
07:02:44.788 --> 07:02:44.798 align:start position:0%
it is causally related
 
07:02:47.590 --> 07:02:47.600 align:start position:0%
coincidentally related not causally
 
07:02:49.110 --> 07:02:49.120 align:start position:0%
they do look at this data that's how we
 
07:02:50.548 --> 07:02:50.558 align:start position:0%
found out about the blood clots and some
 
07:02:51.830 --> 07:02:51.840 align:start position:0%
of the other things that had to do with
 
07:02:53.030 --> 07:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
the j and j
 
07:02:55.910 --> 07:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
but that is a misrepresentation and the
 
07:02:57.910 --> 07:02:57.920 align:start position:0%
reflection on masks
 
07:02:59.590 --> 07:02:59.600 align:start position:0%
made a comment about the dead space and
 
07:03:02.310 --> 07:03:02.320 align:start position:0%
and so on i'm sorry i'm a surgeon i
 
07:03:04.390 --> 07:03:04.400 align:start position:0%
spent my whole time wearing masks
 
07:03:06.230 --> 07:03:06.240 align:start position:0%
other than maybe being short and turning
 
07:03:07.990 --> 07:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
out to be a democrat it didn't have any
 
07:03:11.030 --> 07:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
ill effects on me so the bottom line
 
07:03:13.510 --> 07:03:13.520 align:start position:0%
yes the bottom line is that if you look
 
07:03:15.910 --> 07:03:15.920 align:start position:0%
at the masks the area underneath this
 
07:03:18.150 --> 07:03:18.160 align:start position:0%
the dead space is about 5 ml the
 
07:03:21.110 --> 07:03:21.120 align:start position:0%
anatomic dead space in my pharynx and
 
07:03:25.030 --> 07:03:25.040 align:start position:0%
trachea and bronchioles is about 150 ml
 
07:03:26.390 --> 07:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
so it's an increase of only three
 
07:03:26.400 --> 07:03:27.590 align:start position:0%
so it's an increase of only three
percent

07:03:27.590 --> 07:03:27.600 align:start position:0%
percent
 
07:03:29.110 --> 07:03:29.120 align:start position:0%
many of us have gone snorkeling put a
 
07:03:30.390 --> 07:03:30.400 align:start position:0%
snorkel in your mouth you had a dead
 
07:03:32.948 --> 07:03:32.958 align:start position:0%
space that's about 150 mils it doesn't
 
07:03:33.910 --> 07:03:33.920 align:start position:0%
kill you
 
07:03:35.830 --> 07:03:35.840 align:start position:0%
so the comment that masking
 
07:03:37.590 --> 07:03:37.600 align:start position:0%
causes problems
 
07:03:40.868 --> 07:03:40.878 align:start position:0%
with co2 has not been demonstrated
 
07:03:42.948 --> 07:03:42.958 align:start position:0%
um i would just simply take those couple
 
07:03:44.230 --> 07:03:44.240 align:start position:0%
of thoughts
 
07:03:44.240 --> 07:03:45.910 align:start position:0%
of thoughts
and

07:03:45.910 --> 07:03:45.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:03:47.670 --> 07:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
as you think about those thoughts
 
07:03:49.590 --> 07:03:49.600 align:start position:0%
when we look at the testimony that we
 
07:03:51.270 --> 07:03:51.280 align:start position:0%
heard earlier and i'm sorry to have to
 
07:03:53.910 --> 07:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
say that but those were really not
 
07:03:53.920 --> 07:03:55.110 align:start position:0%
say that but those were really not
correct

07:03:55.110 --> 07:03:55.120 align:start position:0%
correct
 
07:03:58.150 --> 07:03:58.160 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
07:04:11.990 --> 07:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:04:15.750 --> 07:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
having to use a microphone is kind of
 
07:04:17.990 --> 07:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
not something that happens to me
 
07:04:18.000 --> 07:04:18.868 align:start position:0%
not something that happens to me
okay

07:04:18.868 --> 07:04:18.878 align:start position:0%
okay
 
07:04:18.878 --> 07:04:20.230 align:start position:0%
okay
so

07:04:20.230 --> 07:04:20.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:04:23.030 --> 07:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm just looking at this copic 19
 
07:04:25.708 --> 07:04:25.718 align:start position:0%
safety of ivermectin um
 
07:04:28.708 --> 07:04:28.718 align:start position:0%
flccc alliance report
 
07:04:30.788 --> 07:04:30.798 align:start position:0%
are you are you saying
 
07:04:33.350 --> 07:04:33.360 align:start position:0%
that the ivermectin for covet 19 that
 
07:04:37.510 --> 07:04:37.520 align:start position:0%
the 71 trials the 675 scientists the fif
 
07:04:41.510 --> 07:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
the 50 180 patients the 31 ram
 
07:04:44.788 --> 07:04:44.798 align:start position:0%
randomized control trials with 83
 
07:04:47.590 --> 07:04:47.600 align:start position:0%
improvement in 16 prophylactics trials
 
07:04:50.390 --> 07:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
the 66 percent improvement the 34
 
07:04:52.708 --> 07:04:52.718 align:start position:0%
improvement 32 improvement all of that
 
07:04:54.948 --> 07:04:54.958 align:start position:0%
is false is is that is that what i'm
 
07:04:56.948 --> 07:04:56.958 align:start position:0%
hearing you say i don't like to use the
 
07:04:59.750 --> 07:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
word false but is it in error do you
 
07:05:01.190 --> 07:05:01.200 align:start position:0%
think it's error i would not necessarily
 
07:05:03.510 --> 07:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
use that but is it valid data i just
 
07:05:05.190 --> 07:05:05.200 align:start position:0%
went through for example taking this one
 
07:05:06.868 --> 07:05:06.878 align:start position:0%
and showing where it's not really a
 
07:05:08.948 --> 07:05:08.958 align:start position:0%
well-designed study i talked about the
 
07:05:11.350 --> 07:05:11.360 align:start position:0%
one that was sent by bryant which shows
 
07:05:13.270 --> 07:05:13.280 align:start position:0%
that it's really very low evidence
 
07:05:15.350 --> 07:05:15.360 align:start position:0%
i actually put a lot of my stock in the
 
07:05:17.030 --> 07:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
work that was done by the cochran group
 
07:05:18.468 --> 07:05:18.478 align:start position:0%
the cochrane group has been around for
 
07:05:21.670 --> 07:05:21.680 align:start position:0%
decades doing uh meta-analyses of any
 
07:05:23.190 --> 07:05:23.200 align:start position:0%
number of things and they are quite
 
07:05:24.628 --> 07:05:24.638 align:start position:0%
independent so we don't have to worry
 
07:05:26.948 --> 07:05:26.958 align:start position:0%
about its political with the fda or the
 
07:05:29.510 --> 07:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
cdc or nih or anything like that
 
07:05:31.270 --> 07:05:31.280 align:start position:0%
and they did go through all those and
 
07:05:33.270 --> 07:05:33.280 align:start position:0%
many of these studies are small they're
 
07:05:36.230 --> 07:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
poorly controlled they have uh end
 
07:05:38.548 --> 07:05:38.558 align:start position:0%
points that are not well defined
 
07:05:41.110 --> 07:05:41.120 align:start position:0%
and those things simply make them not
 
07:05:42.948 --> 07:05:42.958 align:start position:0%
good data you have to remember that
 
07:05:44.708 --> 07:05:44.718 align:start position:0%
there was a giant push to publish a lot
 
07:05:46.708 --> 07:05:46.718 align:start position:0%
of stuff a lot of stuff got published
 
07:05:48.628 --> 07:05:48.638 align:start position:0%
that was not necessary i hate to use the
 
07:05:50.468 --> 07:05:50.478 align:start position:0%
word false that would imply deception
 
07:05:51.830 --> 07:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
though there are a few that have been
 
07:05:53.830 --> 07:05:53.840 align:start position:0%
found to be truly fraudulent with uh
 
07:05:55.750 --> 07:05:55.760 align:start position:0%
manufactured data but some of them are
 
07:05:57.670 --> 07:05:57.680 align:start position:0%
just simply not studies that are very
 
07:05:59.670 --> 07:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
valid it takes a lot of sophistication
 
07:06:01.590 --> 07:06:01.600 align:start position:0%
to understand levels of evidence it
 
07:06:03.990 --> 07:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
takes a lot of training and that's
 
07:06:05.910 --> 07:06:05.920 align:start position:0%
that's what the concord collaboration
 
07:06:07.670 --> 07:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
does and that's also what the cdc did
 
07:06:08.788 --> 07:06:08.798 align:start position:0%
and so on
 
07:06:11.270 --> 07:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you sir
 
07:06:13.430 --> 07:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
uh so 50
 
07:06:16.310 --> 07:06:16.320 align:start position:0%
180 patients is small
 
07:06:17.990 --> 07:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
is that small well actually i don't have
 
07:06:19.430 --> 07:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
that in front of me right now but i'd
 
07:06:21.670 --> 07:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
have to look again
 
07:06:23.750 --> 07:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
you can't just well that's just a simple
 
07:06:23.760 --> 07:06:25.910 align:start position:0%
you can't just well that's just a simple
question

07:06:25.910 --> 07:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
question
 
07:06:27.910 --> 07:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
but it depends on this depends on the
 
07:06:30.070 --> 07:06:30.080 align:start position:0%
how the study was done
 
07:06:32.628 --> 07:06:32.638 align:start position:0%
i mean the other their study here which
 
07:06:32.638 --> 07:06:33.350 align:start position:0%
i mean the other their study here which
is

07:06:33.350 --> 07:06:33.360 align:start position:0%
is
 
07:06:36.468 --> 07:06:36.478 align:start position:0%
a large study with uh
 
07:06:38.788 --> 07:06:38.798 align:start position:0%
223 000 citizens
 
07:06:41.910 --> 07:06:41.920 align:start position:0%
but it's not randomized in drug trials
 
07:06:43.750 --> 07:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
there's not a lot of reason to accept
 
07:06:45.830 --> 07:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
non-randomized data
 
07:06:47.750 --> 07:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
so numbers alone don't make it matter
 
07:06:50.868 --> 07:06:50.878 align:start position:0%
study design is a very important issue
 
07:06:53.030 --> 07:06:53.040 align:start position:0%
in understanding anything
 
07:06:54.310 --> 07:06:54.320 align:start position:0%
in science
 
07:06:55.830 --> 07:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
so that's what i mean there's a level of
 
07:06:57.030 --> 07:06:57.040 align:start position:0%
sophistication that comes in to
 
07:06:57.040 --> 07:06:58.070 align:start position:0%
sophistication that comes in to
understand

07:06:58.070 --> 07:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
understand
 
07:06:59.750 --> 07:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
how the study is designed what the
 
07:07:02.390 --> 07:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
control groups are how it's validated
 
07:07:04.548 --> 07:07:04.558 align:start position:0%
what's how's the randomization done i
 
07:07:06.310 --> 07:07:06.320 align:start position:0%
mean because just saying we'll take the
 
07:07:08.070 --> 07:07:08.080 align:start position:0%
first 150 people in this group the next
 
07:07:10.310 --> 07:07:10.320 align:start position:0%
150 that's not valid it needs to be a
 
07:07:12.390 --> 07:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
randomization so there's a lot of things
 
07:07:14.830 --> 07:07:14.840 align:start position:0%
that take a high level of skill to
 
07:07:14.840 --> 07:07:16.390 align:start position:0%
that take a high level of skill to
analyze

07:07:16.390 --> 07:07:16.400 align:start position:0%
analyze
 
07:07:18.788 --> 07:07:18.798 align:start position:0%
one more follow-up i'm sorry thank you
 
07:07:20.468 --> 07:07:20.478 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
07:07:22.230 --> 07:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
um well right here it says over the past
 
07:07:25.910 --> 07:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
three decades approximately 3.7 billion
 
07:07:27.350 --> 07:07:27.360 align:start position:0%
doses of ivermectin have been
 
07:07:29.350 --> 07:07:29.360 align:start position:0%
distributed and they've proven to be
 
07:07:32.150 --> 07:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
anti-parasitic as well as antiviral is
 
07:07:34.070 --> 07:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
that a small group
 
07:07:35.670 --> 07:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
i think you'd have to think about the
 
07:07:37.590 --> 07:07:37.600 align:start position:0%
fact that that's over a period of time
 
07:07:40.070 --> 07:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
long long time before covet it's being
 
07:07:42.390 --> 07:07:42.400 align:start position:0%
used for perfectly appropriate
 
07:07:45.430 --> 07:07:45.440 align:start position:0%
indications of treating parasites so
 
07:07:48.230 --> 07:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
it's isn't hasn't been around forever
 
07:07:48.240 --> 07:07:48.948 align:start position:0%
it's isn't hasn't been around forever
no

07:07:48.948 --> 07:07:48.958 align:start position:0%
no
 
07:07:50.548 --> 07:07:50.558 align:start position:0%
that's why i'm discussing the fact
 
07:07:51.990 --> 07:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
that's why i'm discussing the fact that
 
07:07:54.230 --> 07:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
it has to do with the indications for
 
07:07:57.110 --> 07:07:57.120 align:start position:0%
sorry the data for a specific indication
 
07:07:59.270 --> 07:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
nobody says ivermectin's a bad drug it's
 
07:08:02.548 --> 07:08:02.558 align:start position:0%
a great drug for the right indication
 
07:08:09.190 --> 07:08:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:08:10.868 --> 07:08:10.878 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
07:08:13.190 --> 07:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
mr chairman and also representative
 
07:08:14.868 --> 07:08:14.878 align:start position:0%
think of my question
 
07:08:19.030 --> 07:08:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:08:20.628 --> 07:08:20.638 align:start position:0%
i'd end up becoming a democrat but it
 
07:08:22.070 --> 07:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
wasn't because my height
 
07:08:23.590 --> 07:08:23.600 align:start position:0%
could have been part of it
 
07:08:25.510 --> 07:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
but in saying that
 
07:08:27.830 --> 07:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
i'm not here to debate the efficacy of
 
07:08:30.468 --> 07:08:30.478 align:start position:0%
the drug on an indication
 
07:08:33.110 --> 07:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
but i would like us to consider
 
07:08:34.548 --> 07:08:34.558 align:start position:0%
with this information which i have not
 
07:08:36.390 --> 07:08:36.400 align:start position:0%
had a chance to validate
 
07:08:38.548 --> 07:08:38.558 align:start position:0%
on the bidgy access
 
07:08:42.150 --> 07:08:42.160 align:start position:0%
that in fact if the data in here is able
 
07:08:44.230 --> 07:08:44.240 align:start position:0%
to be substantiated
 
07:08:45.750 --> 07:08:45.760 align:start position:0%
and we look at the number of deaths that
 
07:08:48.948 --> 07:08:48.958 align:start position:0%
occurred from ibmectin
 
07:08:50.468 --> 07:08:50.478 align:start position:0%
compared to some of the over counter
 
07:08:52.788 --> 07:08:52.798 align:start position:0%
drugs we have in this country
 
07:08:54.628 --> 07:08:54.638 align:start position:0%
is this possibly a safer drug in some of
 
07:08:56.230 --> 07:08:56.240 align:start position:0%
the other over-the-counter drugs that we
 
07:08:56.240 --> 07:08:57.350 align:start position:0%
the other over-the-counter drugs that we
have

07:08:57.350 --> 07:08:57.360 align:start position:0%
have
 
07:08:59.430 --> 07:08:59.440 align:start position:0%
and therefore if it is my question would
 
07:08:59.440 --> 07:09:00.310 align:start position:0%
and therefore if it is my question would
be

07:09:00.310 --> 07:09:00.320 align:start position:0%
be
 
07:09:01.910 --> 07:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
what's the downside if a patient takes
 
07:09:04.310 --> 07:09:04.320 align:start position:0%
it if it doesn't work
 
07:09:05.830 --> 07:09:05.840 align:start position:0%
well that's that's a wonderful question
 
07:09:07.270 --> 07:09:07.280 align:start position:0%
and we know that for example even just
 
07:09:09.670 --> 07:09:09.680 align:start position:0%
uh anti-inflammatories cholera people
 
07:09:10.948 --> 07:09:10.958 align:start position:0%
with bleeding
 
07:09:12.948 --> 07:09:12.958 align:start position:0%
so if you've used an anti-inflammatory
 
07:09:14.868 --> 07:09:14.878 align:start position:0%
for it as a you know usual indication of
 
07:09:16.310 --> 07:09:16.320 align:start position:0%
treating somebody as arthritis that
 
07:09:17.430 --> 07:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
would probably be good but if you're
 
07:09:19.910 --> 07:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
using the anti-inflammatory to treat
 
07:09:21.270 --> 07:09:21.280 align:start position:0%
something where there's absolutely no
 
07:09:23.910 --> 07:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
data it helps then that benefit risk
 
07:09:26.788 --> 07:09:26.798 align:start position:0%
benefit analysis isn't favorable um one
 
07:09:27.868 --> 07:09:27.878 align:start position:0%
might even argue that the
 
07:09:30.230 --> 07:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
anti-inflammatory for arthritis that
 
07:09:31.910 --> 07:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
risk benefit analysis may be a little
 
07:09:34.548 --> 07:09:34.558 align:start position:0%
bit funny too but the bottom line is we
 
07:09:36.548 --> 07:09:36.558 align:start position:0%
sometimes have very toxic drugs we use
 
07:09:38.468 --> 07:09:38.478 align:start position:0%
with people but it's for incredibly good
 
07:09:40.628 --> 07:09:40.638 align:start position:0%
effect and then we have ones that have a
 
07:09:42.948 --> 07:09:42.958 align:start position:0%
fairly low risk profile
 
07:09:44.150 --> 07:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
but that doesn't mean that it's
 
07:09:45.670 --> 07:09:45.680 align:start position:0%
effective as far as
 
07:09:47.670 --> 07:09:47.680 align:start position:0%
what might happen if a person takes a
 
07:09:49.830 --> 07:09:49.840 align:start position:0%
drug for which there is no indication
 
07:09:52.788 --> 07:09:52.798 align:start position:0%
they also may not seek appropriate care
 
07:09:54.230 --> 07:09:54.240 align:start position:0%
and that can be a bit of a problem and
 
07:09:56.070 --> 07:09:56.080 align:start position:0%
that was when the issues with laetrile
 
07:09:57.590 --> 07:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
is that people go and get treated with
 
07:09:59.030 --> 07:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
laetrile for something rather than
 
07:10:00.788 --> 07:10:00.798 align:start position:0%
getting appropriate care that actually
 
07:10:03.350 --> 07:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
had better evidence
 
07:10:03.360 --> 07:10:04.788 align:start position:0%
had better evidence
follow-up

07:10:04.788 --> 07:10:04.798 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
07:10:06.390 --> 07:10:06.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and also thank you
 
07:10:08.548 --> 07:10:08.558 align:start position:0%
for taking the poll
 
07:10:10.548 --> 07:10:10.558 align:start position:0%
again getting away from the efficacy
 
07:10:12.390 --> 07:10:12.400 align:start position:0%
side of the equation and i'd understand
 
07:10:14.708 --> 07:10:14.718 align:start position:0%
it with somebody taking leotil
 
07:10:17.270 --> 07:10:17.280 align:start position:0%
postponing other therapy but many times
 
07:10:19.350 --> 07:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
people took leah trill also took the
 
07:10:21.670 --> 07:10:21.680 align:start position:0%
same regimens they just augmented the
 
07:10:23.910 --> 07:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
regiment that we normally would have
 
07:10:25.350 --> 07:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
with the hopes it would actually provide
 
07:10:27.270 --> 07:10:27.280 align:start position:0%
some additional benefit
 
07:10:29.670 --> 07:10:29.680 align:start position:0%
the same thing with the mectin if the
 
07:10:32.708 --> 07:10:32.718 align:start position:0%
drug is actually safe okay isn't it
 
07:10:34.628 --> 07:10:34.638 align:start position:0%
really up to the patient to determine
 
07:10:36.390 --> 07:10:36.400 align:start position:0%
whether they want medical advice or not
 
07:10:38.310 --> 07:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
at that point in time as long as the
 
07:10:39.990 --> 07:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
drug that we're allowing them to have
 
07:10:41.350 --> 07:10:41.360 align:start position:0%
access to
 
07:10:43.270 --> 07:10:43.280 align:start position:0%
is not going to be detrimental to their
 
07:10:45.110 --> 07:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
health it may not help them because of
 
07:10:46.788 --> 07:10:46.798 align:start position:0%
the efforts they were talking about but
 
07:10:49.590 --> 07:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
the downside to it is really not there
 
07:10:51.430 --> 07:10:51.440 align:start position:0%
i do agree though again that i said the
 
07:10:53.670 --> 07:10:53.680 align:start position:0%
risk profile is inappropriate doses
 
07:10:56.150 --> 07:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
rather low it's really a pretty safe
 
07:10:56.160 --> 07:10:57.030 align:start position:0%
rather low it's really a pretty safe
drug

07:10:57.030 --> 07:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
drug
 
07:10:59.750 --> 07:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
um my concern is more people not seeking
 
07:11:01.670 --> 07:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
appropriate care and perhaps being
 
07:11:03.670 --> 07:11:03.680 align:start position:0%
treated by something that's really not
 
07:11:06.468 --> 07:11:06.478 align:start position:0%
working that's more my concern for that
 
07:11:08.788 --> 07:11:08.798 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:11:10.628 --> 07:11:10.638 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors of the bill may not ask
 
07:11:10.638 --> 07:11:11.990 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors of the bill may not ask
questions

07:11:11.990 --> 07:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
questions
 
07:11:13.910 --> 07:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
however representative canuck and i
 
07:11:16.948 --> 07:11:16.958 align:start position:0%
developed a workaround on that didn't we
 
07:11:19.030 --> 07:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
we used to write the questions for the
 
07:11:21.030 --> 07:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
other one to ask so move next to
 
07:11:22.310 --> 07:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
somebody and
 
07:11:23.510 --> 07:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
i will do
 
07:11:25.750 --> 07:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
for you what representative webber did
 
07:11:27.430 --> 07:11:27.440 align:start position:0%
for me when she was in the chair that's
 
07:11:29.510 --> 07:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
by the way you're right jerry that's why
 
07:11:30.468 --> 07:11:30.478 align:start position:0%
they say that's why they don't let us
 
07:11:33.990 --> 07:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
sit together anymore anymore yeah
 
07:11:36.070 --> 07:11:36.080 align:start position:0%
uh representative acton
 
07:11:37.510 --> 07:11:37.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
07:11:37.520 --> 07:11:39.270 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
um

07:11:39.270 --> 07:11:39.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:11:41.030 --> 07:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
india thank you for taking my question
 
07:11:41.040 --> 07:11:43.990 align:start position:0%
india thank you for taking my question
doctor

07:11:43.990 --> 07:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:45.910 --> 07:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
in in your knowledge has there ever been
 
07:11:49.350 --> 07:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
a um a precedent like this set where a
 
07:11:52.390 --> 07:11:52.400 align:start position:0%
the pharmacy would not allow
 
07:11:54.070 --> 07:11:54.080 align:start position:0%
the pers
 
07:11:55.670 --> 07:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
the prescription to be filled when a
 
07:11:57.830 --> 07:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
doctor writes the prescription
 
07:11:59.110 --> 07:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
that's really not what we're talking
 
07:12:00.788 --> 07:12:00.798 align:start position:0%
about that was the previous bill this
 
07:12:02.548 --> 07:12:02.558 align:start position:0%
this is asking about a standing order
 
07:12:04.548 --> 07:12:04.558 align:start position:0%
and that's why i said that explicitly
 
07:12:06.390 --> 07:12:06.400 align:start position:0%
that i don't think this bill should be
 
07:12:08.788 --> 07:12:08.798 align:start position:0%
passed because it establishes a standing
 
07:12:10.390 --> 07:12:10.400 align:start position:0%
order for something where the data is
 
07:12:11.830 --> 07:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
not that clear and a stating order is
 
07:12:14.150 --> 07:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
something that we've used before like on
 
07:12:16.070 --> 07:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
oral contraceptives something that has a
 
07:12:17.830 --> 07:12:17.840 align:start position:0%
very long standing track record and is
 
07:12:19.750 --> 07:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
highly effective and that's why we were
 
07:12:22.070 --> 07:12:22.080 align:start position:0%
comfortable going ahead and passing that
 
07:12:22.080 --> 07:12:22.868 align:start position:0%
comfortable going ahead and passing that
but

07:12:22.868 --> 07:12:22.878 align:start position:0%
but
 
07:12:24.390 --> 07:12:24.400 align:start position:0%
because this is about a standing order
 
07:12:26.548 --> 07:12:26.558 align:start position:0%
and i think that it is
 
07:12:28.310 --> 07:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
again i would love it if iver mechton
 
07:12:30.310 --> 07:12:30.320 align:start position:0%
worked i don't have any i don't have any
 
07:12:32.070 --> 07:12:32.080 align:start position:0%
negative feelings about evermakton i
 
07:12:34.310 --> 07:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
just simply would like to see the data
 
07:12:36.230 --> 07:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
real data and i think that until we have
 
07:12:38.230 --> 07:12:38.240 align:start position:0%
that real data a standing order is not a
 
07:12:41.110 --> 07:12:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:12:43.430 --> 07:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
one follow-up
 
07:12:45.910 --> 07:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
um i'm not exactly sure what a standing
 
07:12:47.830 --> 07:12:47.840 align:start position:0%
order is can you take a step back and
 
07:12:49.670 --> 07:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
fill me in i just i don't know exactly
 
07:12:51.270 --> 07:12:51.280 align:start position:0%
what it is according to this bill would
 
07:12:54.468 --> 07:12:54.478 align:start position:0%
be any uh aprn or uh physician i think
 
07:12:55.670 --> 07:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
if i remember right those of the two
 
07:12:57.750 --> 07:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
groups can write an order which then
 
07:12:59.590 --> 07:12:59.600 align:start position:0%
goes to the pharmacist where it's on
 
07:13:02.468 --> 07:13:02.478 align:start position:0%
record and then if a person comes in and
 
07:13:04.468 --> 07:13:04.478 align:start position:0%
says that they wish to have that drug
 
07:13:06.868 --> 07:13:06.878 align:start position:0%
the pharmacist can do a short screen and
 
07:13:09.110 --> 07:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
some counseling uh although again if any
 
07:13:10.310 --> 07:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
of it's been in a pharmacy you know
 
07:13:11.430 --> 07:13:11.440 align:start position:0%
they're rather busy they don't have a
 
07:13:13.110 --> 07:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
lot of time to spend on all that and
 
07:13:14.948 --> 07:13:14.958 align:start position:0%
they don't have your medical record and
 
07:13:17.350 --> 07:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
then they will fill the order based upon
 
07:13:19.030 --> 07:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
that standing order so you don't go see
 
07:13:20.868 --> 07:13:20.878 align:start position:0%
your this had to do with i think a
 
07:13:22.150 --> 07:13:22.160 align:start position:0%
comment that was asked earlier about
 
07:13:23.750 --> 07:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
cutting out the physician and the
 
07:13:25.510 --> 07:13:25.520 align:start position:0%
counseling because you're not going to
 
07:13:28.548 --> 07:13:28.558 align:start position:0%
the physician or or aprn and being
 
07:13:30.230 --> 07:13:30.240 align:start position:0%
counseled about it and then getting a
 
07:13:32.150 --> 07:13:32.160 align:start position:0%
prescription then going to get it filled
 
07:13:34.628 --> 07:13:34.638 align:start position:0%
instead what you're doing is you are
 
07:13:36.708 --> 07:13:36.718 align:start position:0%
going straight to the pharmacist to get
 
07:13:36.718 --> 07:13:37.670 align:start position:0%
going straight to the pharmacist to get
that

07:13:37.670 --> 07:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:13:41.190 --> 07:13:41.200 align:start position:0%
prescription filled based on a protocol
 
07:13:42.948 --> 07:13:42.958 align:start position:0%
okay thank you sure
 
07:13:55.750 --> 07:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:13:57.510 --> 07:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
very naive question
 
07:14:00.070 --> 07:14:00.080 align:start position:0%
right now we have instructions
 
07:14:02.390 --> 07:14:02.400 align:start position:0%
that came from somewhere
 
07:14:05.430 --> 07:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
to doctors not to write prescriptions
 
07:14:09.990 --> 07:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:11.830 --> 07:14:11.840 align:start position:0%
but instead we're going to have standing
 
07:14:13.910 --> 07:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
orders placed with drug stores to let
 
07:14:15.430 --> 07:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
them give it out to anybody that walks
 
07:14:17.910 --> 07:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
in and asked for it right
 
07:14:19.910 --> 07:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
what would be wrong with just changing
 
07:14:22.230 --> 07:14:22.240 align:start position:0%
this bill to say that doctors
 
07:14:24.548 --> 07:14:24.558 align:start position:0%
could not be prohibited
 
07:14:26.708 --> 07:14:26.718 align:start position:0%
from writing prescriptions
 
07:14:28.628 --> 07:14:28.638 align:start position:0%
for ivermectin
 
07:14:30.310 --> 07:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
wasn't that accomplish the same thing
 
07:14:32.230 --> 07:14:32.240 align:start position:0%
then it's the doctor's decision along
 
07:14:36.150 --> 07:14:36.160 align:start position:0%
with the pharmacist but who gets what
 
07:14:38.150 --> 07:14:38.160 align:start position:0%
that that is basically the
 
07:14:38.160 --> 07:14:38.948 align:start position:0%
that that is basically the
the

07:14:38.948 --> 07:14:38.958 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:14:40.948 --> 07:14:40.958 align:start position:0%
contents of the previous bill we heard
 
07:14:42.390 --> 07:14:42.400 align:start position:0%
that had to do with off-label
 
07:14:44.548 --> 07:14:44.558 align:start position:0%
prescribing which is but there has been
 
07:14:47.270 --> 07:14:47.280 align:start position:0%
no guidance given i uh that i i mean i
 
07:14:49.190 --> 07:14:49.200 align:start position:0%
get all the health alert network things
 
07:14:51.350 --> 07:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
nobody has said you can't write for
 
07:14:53.430 --> 07:14:53.440 align:start position:0%
ivermecton we know that there may be
 
07:14:55.190 --> 07:14:55.200 align:start position:0%
certain uh
 
07:14:57.350 --> 07:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
health care places that might do
 
07:14:58.868 --> 07:14:58.878 align:start position:0%
something like that but there's been
 
07:15:00.468 --> 07:15:00.478 align:start position:0%
nothing that's come down from
 
07:15:01.830 --> 07:15:01.840 align:start position:0%
not saying not to do it if you look at
 
07:15:04.230 --> 07:15:04.240 align:start position:0%
the cdc it says there is no evidence it
 
07:15:05.830 --> 07:15:05.840 align:start position:0%
can be used but it should be used in a
 
07:15:07.910 --> 07:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
clinical trial
 
07:15:09.750 --> 07:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
but are we not correct haven't we heard
 
07:15:11.750 --> 07:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
testimony that people walk into drug
 
07:15:11.760 --> 07:15:12.948 align:start position:0%
testimony that people walk into drug
stores

07:15:12.948 --> 07:15:12.958 align:start position:0%
stores
 
07:15:15.430 --> 07:15:15.440 align:start position:0%
with a prescription from a doctor
 
07:15:18.628 --> 07:15:18.638 align:start position:0%
and they're told that they cannot
 
07:15:21.110 --> 07:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
do they cannot fill those prescriptions
 
07:15:22.788 --> 07:15:22.798 align:start position:0%
is that not a fact
 
07:15:25.110 --> 07:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
all right am i wrong again that is the
 
07:15:27.350 --> 07:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
that is uh related to a different bill
 
07:15:28.708 --> 07:15:28.718 align:start position:0%
not to this bill so we probably
 
07:15:31.110 --> 07:15:31.120 align:start position:0%
shouldn't spend too much time on it um i
 
07:15:32.628 --> 07:15:32.638 align:start position:0%
do not know whether pharmacists have
 
07:15:35.190 --> 07:15:35.200 align:start position:0%
been uh forbidden to fill that or not
 
07:15:36.868 --> 07:15:36.878 align:start position:0%
perhaps uh representative merchant would
 
07:15:38.390 --> 07:15:38.400 align:start position:0%
know just a smidge more about that than
 
07:15:38.400 --> 07:15:39.270 align:start position:0%
know just a smidge more about that than
i

07:15:39.270 --> 07:15:39.280 align:start position:0%
i
 
07:15:41.350 --> 07:15:41.360 align:start position:0%
i have a great idea
 
07:15:43.830 --> 07:15:43.840 align:start position:0%
let's ask a pharmacist
 
07:15:46.548 --> 07:15:46.558 align:start position:0%
that's why he's here
 
07:15:48.708 --> 07:15:48.718 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
07:15:50.868 --> 07:15:50.878 align:start position:0%
in regards to the issue with pharmacies
 
07:15:52.548 --> 07:15:52.558 align:start position:0%
first of all it's a pharmacist that
 
07:15:54.070 --> 07:15:54.080 align:start position:0%
dispenses if not a pharmacy i want to
 
07:15:55.350 --> 07:15:55.360 align:start position:0%
make that clear
 
07:15:57.670 --> 07:15:57.680 align:start position:0%
number two a lot of times it comes down
 
07:15:59.350 --> 07:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
to is the employer because of the
 
07:15:59.360 --> 07:16:00.628 align:start position:0%
to is the employer because of the
political

07:16:00.628 --> 07:16:00.638 align:start position:0%
political
 
07:16:03.830 --> 07:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
policy polarization of this process must
 
07:16:05.670 --> 07:16:05.680 align:start position:0%
be political
 
07:16:08.230 --> 07:16:08.240 align:start position:0%
a lot of corporations have elected not
 
07:16:10.788 --> 07:16:10.798 align:start position:0%
to stock the drug in the pharmacy so
 
07:16:12.628 --> 07:16:12.638 align:start position:0%
even if the pharmacist wanted to
 
07:16:14.548 --> 07:16:14.558 align:start position:0%
dispense it to a patient
 
07:16:17.110 --> 07:16:17.120 align:start position:0%
which is a professional preview on a
 
07:16:19.430 --> 07:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
valid prescription from a physician
 
07:16:21.510 --> 07:16:21.520 align:start position:0%
because the owner of the pharmacy
 
07:16:23.510 --> 07:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
refuses the stock the product in the
 
07:16:23.520 --> 07:16:24.628 align:start position:0%
refuses the stock the product in the
pharmacy

07:16:24.628 --> 07:16:24.638 align:start position:0%
pharmacy
 
07:16:25.910 --> 07:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
that takes it out of the hand of the
 
07:16:27.750 --> 07:16:27.760 align:start position:0%
pharmacist because it's not available
 
07:16:30.070 --> 07:16:30.080 align:start position:0%
obviously you can't dispense it
 
07:16:32.310 --> 07:16:32.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for answering for me
 
07:16:34.830 --> 07:16:34.840 align:start position:0%
that's what we do here
 
07:16:38.230 --> 07:16:38.240 align:start position:0%
yes representative leon
 
07:16:40.070 --> 07:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
07:16:42.628 --> 07:16:42.638 align:start position:0%
taking my question um
 
07:16:44.230 --> 07:16:44.240 align:start position:0%
when you're discussing the quality of
 
07:16:45.910 --> 07:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
evidence there's there's definitely some
 
07:16:49.030 --> 07:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
important points to notice um obviously
 
07:16:51.190 --> 07:16:51.200 align:start position:0%
i understand why you have concern about
 
07:16:53.190 --> 07:16:53.200 align:start position:0%
the efficacy data when you're when
 
07:16:55.110 --> 07:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
you're doing a meta-analysis of so many
 
07:16:56.468 --> 07:16:56.478 align:start position:0%
small studies
 
07:16:56.478 --> 07:16:57.510 align:start position:0%
small studies
however

07:16:57.510 --> 07:16:57.520 align:start position:0%
however
 
07:16:59.510 --> 07:16:59.520 align:start position:0%
in my experience evaluating clinical
 
07:16:59.520 --> 07:17:00.548 align:start position:0%
in my experience evaluating clinical
trials

07:17:00.548 --> 07:17:00.558 align:start position:0%
trials
 
07:17:03.350 --> 07:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
i have never seen a problem before where
 
07:17:05.030 --> 07:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
if there's a signa
 
07:17:08.230 --> 07:17:08.240 align:start position:0%
significant safety signal that this type
 
07:17:08.240 --> 07:17:09.590 align:start position:0%
significant safety signal that this type
of

07:17:09.590 --> 07:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
of
 
07:17:11.190 --> 07:17:11.200 align:start position:0%
vast data
 
07:17:13.910 --> 07:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
would not show a safety signal
 
07:17:16.388 --> 07:17:16.398 align:start position:0%
so when you have no safety signal and
 
07:17:18.388 --> 07:17:18.398 align:start position:0%
we're looking at a model
 
07:17:20.788 --> 07:17:20.798 align:start position:0%
that is based off of oral contraceptives
 
07:17:22.788 --> 07:17:22.798 align:start position:0%
that have a strong safety signal they
 
07:17:25.030 --> 07:17:25.040 align:start position:0%
can be lethal to some women
 
07:17:28.150 --> 07:17:28.160 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm trying to understand
 
07:17:28.160 --> 07:17:29.030 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm trying to understand
why

07:17:29.030 --> 07:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
why
 
07:17:31.750 --> 07:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
we'd want to prohibit patients trying a
 
07:17:33.990 --> 07:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
therapy when they're only now told to go
 
07:17:35.990 --> 07:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
home and wait until you can't breathe
 
07:17:36.000 --> 07:17:36.788 align:start position:0%
home and wait until you can't breathe
when

07:17:36.788 --> 07:17:36.798 align:start position:0%
when
 
07:17:38.788 --> 07:17:38.798 align:start position:0%
we can debate the efficacy based on the
 
07:17:40.468 --> 07:17:40.478 align:start position:0%
quality of clinical data
 
07:17:40.478 --> 07:17:41.670 align:start position:0%
quality of clinical data
but

07:17:41.670 --> 07:17:41.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
07:17:43.190 --> 07:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
there's nothing i don't see much to
 
07:17:44.788 --> 07:17:44.798 align:start position:0%
debate on the safety so i'm trying to
 
07:17:46.788 --> 07:17:46.798 align:start position:0%
understand why why you're against this
 
07:17:49.910 --> 07:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
choice uh well as i said i i don't have
 
07:17:51.670 --> 07:17:51.680 align:start position:0%
there is not a strong safety signal i
 
07:17:53.350 --> 07:17:53.360 align:start position:0%
agree with that 100
 
07:17:56.070 --> 07:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
this is a relatively benign drug the
 
07:17:59.110 --> 07:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
issue is is it is it to have benefit the
 
07:18:01.030 --> 07:18:01.040 align:start position:0%
risks are small but you still want to
 
07:18:03.350 --> 07:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
have a decent benefit to justify the use
 
07:18:05.350 --> 07:18:05.360 align:start position:0%
of any medication
 
07:18:06.948 --> 07:18:06.958 align:start position:0%
if i could follow up follow up um and
 
07:18:08.628 --> 07:18:08.638 align:start position:0%
then my follow-up is right now the
 
07:18:10.628 --> 07:18:10.638 align:start position:0%
treatment alternative is either for some
 
07:18:13.030 --> 07:18:13.040 align:start position:0%
people pavloxid but people with atrial
 
07:18:14.150 --> 07:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
fibrillation have strong
 
07:18:15.990 --> 07:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
contraindications it takes a month to
 
07:18:18.150 --> 07:18:18.160 align:start position:0%
get amiodarone out of the cardigan
 
07:18:20.868 --> 07:18:20.878 align:start position:0%
tissue so they can't switch over um
 
07:18:22.388 --> 07:18:22.398 align:start position:0%
there's the if they're going to die
 
07:18:24.230 --> 07:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
they'll be dead before then and then
 
07:18:26.548 --> 07:18:26.558 align:start position:0%
other people look at the safety signal
 
07:18:28.628 --> 07:18:28.638 align:start position:0%
and when they're looking at staying home
 
07:18:30.310 --> 07:18:30.320 align:start position:0%
watching netflix and hoping they can
 
07:18:31.990 --> 07:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
keep breathing
 
07:18:34.388 --> 07:18:34.398 align:start position:0%
and going to an overloaded hospital full
 
07:18:36.548 --> 07:18:36.558 align:start position:0%
of people that had nothing except for
 
07:18:39.350 --> 07:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
rest as therapy
 
07:18:41.190 --> 07:18:41.200 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to understand why people
 
07:18:43.110 --> 07:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
should be denied
 
07:18:46.388 --> 07:18:46.398 align:start position:0%
a clear path to a therapeutic that shows
 
07:18:48.548 --> 07:18:48.558 align:start position:0%
a signal of efficacy
 
07:18:50.468 --> 07:18:50.478 align:start position:0%
very little safety risk
 
07:18:52.788 --> 07:18:52.798 align:start position:0%
and could benefit overall health by
 
07:18:55.190 --> 07:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
reducing the burden on our hospitals
 
07:18:56.788 --> 07:18:56.798 align:start position:0%
which are overloaded for a couple
 
07:18:58.708 --> 07:18:58.718 align:start position:0%
different reasons
 
07:18:58.718 --> 07:19:00.310 align:start position:0%
different reasons
um

07:19:00.310 --> 07:19:00.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:19:01.510 --> 07:19:01.520 align:start position:0%
you know i mean
 
07:19:02.468 --> 07:19:02.478 align:start position:0%
i guess
 
07:19:04.708 --> 07:19:04.718 align:start position:0%
the the difficulty i've got here is just
 
07:19:04.718 --> 07:19:05.910 align:start position:0%
the the difficulty i've got here is just
simply

07:19:05.910 --> 07:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
simply
 
07:19:05.920 --> 07:19:07.030 align:start position:0%
simply
that

07:19:07.030 --> 07:19:07.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:19:09.350 --> 07:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
what i said earlier i think that may
 
07:19:11.110 --> 07:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
well okay i'll be a little more blunt
 
07:19:12.628 --> 07:19:12.638 align:start position:0%
some people seem to be relying on this
 
07:19:14.150 --> 07:19:14.160 align:start position:0%
as an option rather than for example
 
07:19:16.310 --> 07:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
getting vaccinated that does have
 
07:19:19.030 --> 07:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
a good evidence that it's helpful and i
 
07:19:20.628 --> 07:19:20.638 align:start position:0%
would think that that would probably be
 
07:19:23.190 --> 07:19:23.200 align:start position:0%
a more reasonable option and likewise
 
07:19:25.110 --> 07:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
they may not seek other treatment which
 
07:19:27.030 --> 07:19:27.040 align:start position:0%
may be a problem there there are other
 
07:19:28.868 --> 07:19:28.878 align:start position:0%
treatments that are now available they
 
07:19:32.628 --> 07:19:32.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:19:35.030 --> 07:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
sorry last follow-up um we're seeing
 
07:19:37.190 --> 07:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
that there's still a large risk of
 
07:19:39.750 --> 07:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
contracting covid even with the vaccine
 
07:19:41.830 --> 07:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
80 percent of people are catching
 
07:19:44.548 --> 07:19:44.558 align:start position:0%
omicron and the relative risk of death
 
07:19:46.548 --> 07:19:46.558 align:start position:0%
from vaccinated to the unvaccinated
 
07:19:48.708 --> 07:19:48.718 align:start position:0%
before they ended the trial early was it
 
07:19:50.948 --> 07:19:50.958 align:start position:0%
cut the risk of death in half
 
07:19:52.468 --> 07:19:52.478 align:start position:0%
you can run the numbers whichever way
 
07:19:54.150 --> 07:19:54.160 align:start position:0%
you want but when it's two versus one it
 
07:19:56.310 --> 07:19:56.320 align:start position:0%
cuts the risk in half
 
07:19:57.750 --> 07:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm trying to understand why
 
07:19:59.510 --> 07:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
those aren't complementary for those
 
07:20:01.110 --> 07:20:01.120 align:start position:0%
people who are going to make whichever
 
07:20:02.548 --> 07:20:02.558 align:start position:0%
choice they want
 
07:20:04.070 --> 07:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
nobody's being forced to take the
 
07:20:06.070 --> 07:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
ivormectin and i don't think people
 
07:20:08.628 --> 07:20:08.638 align:start position:0%
choosing that are really basing their
 
07:20:10.868 --> 07:20:10.878 align:start position:0%
vaccine choice off of whether or not
 
07:20:12.788 --> 07:20:12.798 align:start position:0%
they can get a valid prescription for
 
07:20:12.798 --> 07:20:14.868 align:start position:0%
they can get a valid prescription for
iberomectin

07:20:14.868 --> 07:20:14.878 align:start position:0%
iberomectin
 
07:20:17.350 --> 07:20:17.360 align:start position:0%
representative folsom
 
07:20:19.590 --> 07:20:19.600 align:start position:0%
thank you and we're actually starting to
 
07:20:22.310 --> 07:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
testify something yeah yeah yeah i know
 
07:20:23.590 --> 07:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
i was wondering if that was a question
 
07:20:23.600 --> 07:20:24.548 align:start position:0%
i was wondering if that was a question
but

07:20:24.548 --> 07:20:24.558 align:start position:0%
but
 
07:20:25.830 --> 07:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
but representative land always makes
 
07:20:27.990 --> 07:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
excellent points so
 
07:20:28.000 --> 07:20:29.510 align:start position:0%
excellent points so
um

07:20:29.510 --> 07:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:20:31.670 --> 07:20:31.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um and
 
07:20:33.270 --> 07:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
i'll make it a question
 
07:20:35.110 --> 07:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
should people who
 
07:20:37.830 --> 07:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
are advised by their physicians
 
07:20:40.468 --> 07:20:40.478 align:start position:0%
not to get
 
07:20:40.478 --> 07:20:42.230 align:start position:0%
not to get
the

07:20:42.230 --> 07:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:20:46.070 --> 07:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
vaccine shots of whichever company
 
07:20:48.388 --> 07:20:48.398 align:start position:0%
and that it would be contra it would
 
07:20:50.310 --> 07:20:50.320 align:start position:0%
just be a really bad situation based on
 
07:20:52.468 --> 07:20:52.478 align:start position:0%
their medical
 
07:20:52.478 --> 07:20:53.590 align:start position:0%
their medical
files

07:20:53.590 --> 07:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
files
 
07:20:55.670 --> 07:20:55.680 align:start position:0%
and conditions and
 
07:20:57.590 --> 07:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
would it be
 
07:21:00.628 --> 07:21:00.638 align:start position:0%
best if that doctor then could say
 
07:21:02.948 --> 07:21:02.958 align:start position:0%
you know we can't give you the vaccine
 
07:21:02.958 --> 07:21:03.670 align:start position:0%
you know we can't give you the vaccine
but

07:21:03.670 --> 07:21:03.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
07:21:07.430 --> 07:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:21:08.548 --> 07:21:08.558 align:start position:0%
i think that's an interesting question
 
07:21:10.388 --> 07:21:10.398 align:start position:0%
because we don't you know the person
 
07:21:11.590 --> 07:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't have
 
07:21:14.388 --> 07:21:14.398 align:start position:0%
sorry i'm following up sorry because the
 
07:21:18.868 --> 07:21:18.878 align:start position:0%
person doesn't have the option of taking
 
07:21:21.270 --> 07:21:21.280 align:start position:0%
the the vaccine
 
07:21:25.750 --> 07:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
we're buddies now um and so
 
07:21:30.310 --> 07:21:30.320 align:start position:0%
our options are limited and i'm gonna
 
07:21:32.388 --> 07:21:32.398 align:start position:0%
people who do that want to go get
 
07:21:34.548 --> 07:21:34.558 align:start position:0%
everything they possibly can
 
07:21:36.628 --> 07:21:36.638 align:start position:0%
i think that would be a wonderful study
 
07:21:37.830 --> 07:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
and i think that should be done in a
 
07:21:39.990 --> 07:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
study protocol i would i would firmly
 
07:21:41.910 --> 07:21:41.920 align:start position:0%
support that
 
07:21:44.708 --> 07:21:44.718 align:start position:0%
what if that person what if that person
 
07:21:47.590 --> 07:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
contracts covid before the study's done
 
07:21:49.670 --> 07:21:49.680 align:start position:0%
always a risk i'm not quite sure the how
 
07:21:51.510 --> 07:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
to answer that for you
 
07:21:53.030 --> 07:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
but i think i've taken much more time
 
07:21:56.150 --> 07:21:56.160 align:start position:0%
than i should so i want to thank you and
 
07:21:59.510 --> 07:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
in terms of your comments earlier about
 
07:22:02.388 --> 07:22:02.398 align:start position:0%
what chronic mask wearing
 
07:22:04.548 --> 07:22:04.558 align:start position:0%
did to you
 
07:22:07.110 --> 07:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
i just want you to know that many of my
 
07:22:09.270 --> 07:22:09.280 align:start position:0%
good friends are
 
07:22:09.280 --> 07:22:10.230 align:start position:0%
good friends are
short

07:22:10.230 --> 07:22:10.240 align:start position:0%
short
 
07:22:10.240 --> 07:22:10.948 align:start position:0%
short
right

07:22:10.948 --> 07:22:10.958 align:start position:0%
right
 
07:22:12.310 --> 07:22:12.320 align:start position:0%
and actually i didn't start wearing a
 
07:22:14.388 --> 07:22:14.398 align:start position:0%
mask until i had supposedly finished my
 
07:22:15.990 --> 07:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
longitudinal growth which actually i
 
07:22:19.030 --> 07:22:19.040 align:start position:0%
don't think ever occurred so
 
07:22:20.310 --> 07:22:20.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:22:22.070 --> 07:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
that was just an attempt at some humor
 
07:22:24.830 --> 07:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
it's getting late we needed something it
 
07:22:24.840 --> 07:22:26.388 align:start position:0%
it's getting late we needed something it
is

07:22:26.388 --> 07:22:26.398 align:start position:0%
is
 
07:22:28.150 --> 07:22:28.160 align:start position:0%
okay humor is always allowed in this
 
07:22:28.160 --> 07:22:30.150 align:start position:0%
okay humor is always allowed in this
committee

07:22:30.150 --> 07:22:30.160 align:start position:0%
committee
 
07:22:31.910 --> 07:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
i'd like to call on the honorable linda
 
07:22:43.350 --> 07:22:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:22:44.708 --> 07:22:44.718 align:start position:0%
chairman i just want to let you know
 
07:22:46.948 --> 07:22:46.958 align:start position:0%
that i haven't seen one person wipe
 
07:22:50.230 --> 07:22:50.240 align:start position:0%
microphone down after each use
 
07:22:52.948 --> 07:22:52.958 align:start position:0%
and i'm not going to start
 
07:22:55.190 --> 07:22:55.200 align:start position:0%

committee thank you committee members
 
07:23:08.468 --> 07:23:08.478 align:start position:0%
for your time and service
 
07:23:10.948 --> 07:23:10.958 align:start position:0%
i did send my testimony and i'm
 
07:23:14.070 --> 07:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
i know that i'm being timed so

um thank you for allowing me to testify
 
07:23:19.830 --> 07:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
i'm familiar with standing orders and
 
07:23:22.150 --> 07:23:22.160 align:start position:0%
believe pharmacists
 
07:23:24.868 --> 07:23:24.878 align:start position:0%
are as well a physician or an advanced
 
07:23:26.948 --> 07:23:26.958 align:start position:0%
practice registered nurse must write the
 
07:23:28.708 --> 07:23:28.718 align:start position:0%
prescription for the standing order
 
07:23:30.310 --> 07:23:30.320 align:start position:0%
before a patient has
 
07:23:30.320 --> 07:23:31.510 align:start position:0%
before a patient has
access

07:23:31.510 --> 07:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
access
 
07:23:33.670 --> 07:23:33.680 align:start position:0%
to the medication our current state of
 
07:23:37.750 --> 07:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
affairs has interfered with the honored
 
07:23:40.788 --> 07:23:40.798 align:start position:0%
patient physician relationship
 
07:23:42.388 --> 07:23:42.398 align:start position:0%
in that doctors are pressured with
 
07:23:46.070 --> 07:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
disciplinary action if certain drugs
 
07:23:48.468 --> 07:23:48.478 align:start position:0%
are prescribed never in my nursing
 
07:23:52.310 --> 07:23:52.320 align:start position:0%
career and it's i've been around
 
07:23:54.628 --> 07:23:54.638 align:start position:0%
have i witnessed such censorship of
 
07:23:57.910 --> 07:23:57.920 align:start position:0%
free-flowing discussion and debate on
 
07:24:00.310 --> 07:24:00.320 align:start position:0%
appropriate treatments as i have seen
 
07:24:00.320 --> 07:24:01.430 align:start position:0%
appropriate treatments as i have seen
with

07:24:01.430 --> 07:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
with
 
07:24:04.388 --> 07:24:04.398 align:start position:0%
the 2020 covid19 arrival
 
07:24:06.948 --> 07:24:06.958 align:start position:0%
the closest degree of censorship
 
07:24:09.270 --> 07:24:09.280 align:start position:0%
that i've witnessed was during the 1980s
 
07:24:12.150 --> 07:24:12.160 align:start position:0%
hiv epidemic so it brings that back to
 
07:24:13.510 --> 07:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
mind to me
 
07:24:16.948 --> 07:24:16.958 align:start position:0%
american sense something is amiss real
 
07:24:20.548 --> 07:24:20.558 align:start position:0%
scientific research demands open debate
 
07:24:22.628 --> 07:24:22.638 align:start position:0%
by many credentialed scientists and
 
07:24:25.510 --> 07:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
physicians but this has not but this has
 
07:24:25.520 --> 07:24:26.388 align:start position:0%
physicians but this has not but this has
been

07:24:26.388 --> 07:24:26.398 align:start position:0%
been
 
07:24:29.430 --> 07:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
severely curtailed in america and
 
07:24:31.270 --> 07:24:31.280 align:start position:0%
worldwide why
 
07:24:33.350 --> 07:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
over time it may be revealed that there
 
07:24:35.830 --> 07:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
are underlying stakeholders whose
 
07:24:38.070 --> 07:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
interests are not in the best interests
 
07:24:39.590 --> 07:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
of society
 
07:24:41.990 --> 07:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
never was i so disappointed and i might
 
07:24:44.310 --> 07:24:44.320 align:start position:0%
have mentioned this to you last week
 
07:24:46.388 --> 07:24:46.398 align:start position:0%
in the medical establishment as when i
 
07:24:50.388 --> 07:24:50.398 align:start position:0%
visited my wonderful physician last fall
 
07:24:54.070 --> 07:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
i point blank asked him
 
07:24:56.548 --> 07:24:56.558 align:start position:0%
if a prescription for the fda approved
 
07:24:59.830 --> 07:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
drug ivermectin would be prescribed off
 
07:25:02.468 --> 07:25:02.478 align:start position:0%
label if he would do that if i were to
 
07:25:05.190 --> 07:25:05.200 align:start position:0%
become ill with covet 19
 
07:25:07.190 --> 07:25:07.200 align:start position:0%
after an awkward moment of silence and
 
07:25:09.910 --> 07:25:09.920 align:start position:0%
it was a pretty long moment
 
07:25:11.670 --> 07:25:11.680 align:start position:0%
my trusted physician shared that
 
07:25:14.150 --> 07:25:14.160 align:start position:0%
disciplinary action was threatened by
 
07:25:17.110 --> 07:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
the physicians association board
 
07:25:19.910 --> 07:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
the physician declined due to the threat
 
07:25:22.150 --> 07:25:22.160 align:start position:0%
of losing his license to practice
 
07:25:24.388 --> 07:25:24.398 align:start position:0%
medicine as a former girl scout i always
 
07:25:26.628 --> 07:25:26.638 align:start position:0%
have to prepare for the unexpected there
 
07:25:28.628 --> 07:25:28.638 align:start position:0%
is a worldwide network of scientists and
 
07:25:31.270 --> 07:25:31.280 align:start position:0%
physicians who are courageous enough
 
07:25:33.670 --> 07:25:33.680 align:start position:0%
we saw one or two today
 
07:25:35.590 --> 07:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
to help people reduce their risk of
 
07:25:38.628 --> 07:25:38.638 align:start position:0%
serious complications from cobit 19
 
07:25:41.110 --> 07:25:41.120 align:start position:0%
by sharing early treatment protocols one
 
07:25:43.910 --> 07:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
element of that early treatment one
 
07:25:43.920 --> 07:25:44.628 align:start position:0%
element of that early treatment one
is

07:25:44.628 --> 07:25:44.638 align:start position:0%
is
 
07:25:44.638 --> 07:25:46.150 align:start position:0%
is
ivermectin

07:25:46.150 --> 07:25:46.160 align:start position:0%
ivermectin
 
07:25:47.830 --> 07:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
i had to go outside in new hampshire to
 
07:25:50.388 --> 07:25:50.398 align:start position:0%
secure a legal ivermectin prescription
 
07:25:52.070 --> 07:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
and fill the prescription at a local
 
07:25:52.080 --> 07:25:53.670 align:start position:0%
and fill the prescription at a local
pharmacy

07:25:53.670 --> 07:25:53.680 align:start position:0%
pharmacy
 
07:25:56.388 --> 07:25:56.398 align:start position:0%
last october i became ill with coven i
 
07:26:00.150 --> 07:26:00.160 align:start position:0%
had already taken vitamin c d3 and zinc
 
07:26:02.310 --> 07:26:02.320 align:start position:0%
i added the short-term ivermectin to my
 
07:26:04.230 --> 07:26:04.240 align:start position:0%
early treatment program and avoided
 
07:26:05.750 --> 07:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
serious illness
 
07:26:09.510 --> 07:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
and hospitalization isn't that our goal
 
07:26:11.670 --> 07:26:11.680 align:start position:0%
please vote ought to pass on this bill
 
07:26:12.548 --> 07:26:12.558 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:26:17.750 --> 07:26:17.760 align:start position:0%

07:27:01.750 --> 07:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
health
 
07:27:04.150 --> 07:27:04.160 align:start position:0%
first i'd like to just note that the cdc
 
07:27:08.548 --> 07:27:08.558 align:start position:0%
fda nih and idsa do not recommend using
 
07:27:10.468 --> 07:27:10.478 align:start position:0%
ibermectin for the treatment of cobit
 
07:27:13.750 --> 07:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
outside of clinical trials
 
07:27:15.670 --> 07:27:15.680 align:start position:0%
fortunately right now the fda has
 
07:27:17.830 --> 07:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
granted emergency use authorization for
 
07:27:17.840 --> 07:27:18.708 align:start position:0%
granted emergency use authorization for
two

07:27:18.708 --> 07:27:18.718 align:start position:0%
two
 
07:27:21.750 --> 07:27:21.760 align:start position:0%
anti-viral medications
 
07:27:24.468 --> 07:27:24.478 align:start position:0%
but ivermectin is not one of them
 
07:27:26.548 --> 07:27:26.558 align:start position:0%
we have some questions when it comes to
 
07:27:27.910 --> 07:27:27.920 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
07:27:29.830 --> 07:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
first there's a question of necessity
 
07:27:31.990 --> 07:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
when it comes to this bill
 
07:27:33.670 --> 07:27:33.680 align:start position:0%
if a provider can write forever mectin
 
07:27:34.708 --> 07:27:34.718 align:start position:0%
right now
 
07:27:37.270 --> 07:27:37.280 align:start position:0%
is this uh billness
 
07:27:40.150 --> 07:27:40.160 align:start position:0%
is there a necessity for this bill
 
07:27:42.388 --> 07:27:42.398 align:start position:0%
a couple of logistics questions
 
07:27:44.388 --> 07:27:44.398 align:start position:0%
um who would write for the standing
 
07:27:44.398 --> 07:27:45.270 align:start position:0%
um who would write for the standing
order

07:27:45.270 --> 07:27:45.280 align:start position:0%
order
 
07:27:47.430 --> 07:27:47.440 align:start position:0%
is it the state's chief medical officer
 
07:27:49.350 --> 07:27:49.360 align:start position:0%
or a chief medical officer of a hospital
 
07:27:51.350 --> 07:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
or healthcare system that's just not
 
07:27:54.070 --> 07:27:54.080 align:start position:0%
answered in the bill
 
07:27:54.080 --> 07:27:55.670 align:start position:0%
answered in the bill
finally

07:27:55.670 --> 07:27:55.680 align:start position:0%
finally
 
07:27:57.430 --> 07:27:57.440 align:start position:0%
the purpose of a standing order is to
 
07:28:01.190 --> 07:28:01.200 align:start position:0%
increase access to care for patients
 
07:28:03.030 --> 07:28:03.040 align:start position:0%
and we have a couple of standing orders
 
07:28:06.628 --> 07:28:06.638 align:start position:0%
as has been noted in the state right now
 
07:28:07.830 --> 07:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
and those
 
07:28:09.590 --> 07:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
medications are to benefit the general
 
07:28:09.600 --> 07:28:10.548 align:start position:0%
medications are to benefit the general
public

07:28:10.548 --> 07:28:10.558 align:start position:0%
public
 
07:28:13.190 --> 07:28:13.200 align:start position:0%
and if ivermectin is not a standing
 
07:28:15.910 --> 07:28:15.920 align:start position:0%
order right now um we believe that it's
 
07:28:17.910 --> 07:28:17.920 align:start position:0%
it isn't in the best interest of the of
 
07:28:19.830 --> 07:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
the public to um
 
07:28:19.840 --> 07:28:21.750 align:start position:0%
the public to um
to

07:28:21.750 --> 07:28:21.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
07:28:23.430 --> 07:28:23.440 align:start position:0%
to establish a standing order for this
 
07:28:23.440 --> 07:28:25.750 align:start position:0%
to establish a standing order for this
medication

07:28:25.750 --> 07:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
medication
 
07:28:27.750 --> 07:28:27.760 align:start position:0%
so that concludes my testimony uh
 
07:28:33.910 --> 07:28:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:28:35.510 --> 07:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
07:28:37.430 --> 07:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
coming to testify and waiting so long
 
07:28:39.510 --> 07:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
with our long bill
 
07:28:42.150 --> 07:28:42.160 align:start position:0%
my question is about the availability of
 
07:28:44.388 --> 07:28:44.398 align:start position:0%
prescribers to to write prescriptions
 
07:28:46.150 --> 07:28:46.160 align:start position:0%
for ivermectin
 
07:28:47.670 --> 07:28:47.680 align:start position:0%
is dartmouth-hitchcock allowing
 
07:28:49.670 --> 07:28:49.680 align:start position:0%
providers to write those prescriptions
 
07:28:52.948 --> 07:28:52.958 align:start position:0%
and is there any guidelines or any other
 
07:28:54.548 --> 07:28:54.558 align:start position:0%
encouragement or discouragement
 
07:28:54.558 --> 07:28:56.150 align:start position:0%
encouragement or discouragement
happening

07:28:56.150 --> 07:28:56.160 align:start position:0%
happening
 
07:28:58.548 --> 07:28:58.558 align:start position:0%
i have not seen uh internal policies
 
07:29:00.388 --> 07:29:00.398 align:start position:0%
relative to ivermecton i can certainly
 
07:29:01.670 --> 07:29:01.680 align:start position:0%
get the answer to that representative
 
07:29:02.948 --> 07:29:02.958 align:start position:0%
glenn and get back to you i'd be happy
 
07:29:04.468 --> 07:29:04.478 align:start position:0%
to do that thank you and if i can have
 
07:29:06.788 --> 07:29:06.798 align:start position:0%
one follower um and are you aware that
 
07:29:08.468 --> 07:29:08.478 align:start position:0%
without an fda approval for an
 
07:29:10.708 --> 07:29:10.718 align:start position:0%
indication nobody can make a positive
 
07:29:12.230 --> 07:29:12.240 align:start position:0%
recommendation for the use of a
 
07:29:15.990 --> 07:29:16.000 align:start position:0%
therapeutic so a neutral response such
 
07:29:19.110 --> 07:29:19.120 align:start position:0%
as the nih going from do not use to a no
 
07:29:21.910 --> 07:29:21.920 align:start position:0%
position is as positive a recommendation
 
07:29:24.628 --> 07:29:24.638 align:start position:0%
as any of these societies can have
 
07:29:26.468 --> 07:29:26.478 align:start position:0%
i am not a clinician i'm an attorney by
 
07:29:29.750 --> 07:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
training so i i'm i can't speak to that
 
07:29:32.548 --> 07:29:32.558 align:start position:0%
thank you i have a question um i'm just
 
07:29:34.948 --> 07:29:34.958 align:start position:0%
a liberal arts guy so humor me and help
 
07:29:37.510 --> 07:29:37.520 align:start position:0%
me here but um
 
07:29:40.548 --> 07:29:40.558 align:start position:0%
it seems that the vaccines
 
07:29:43.030 --> 07:29:43.040 align:start position:0%
were and this is not a dirty word
 
07:29:43.040 --> 07:29:44.070 align:start position:0%
were and this is not a dirty word
rushed

07:29:44.070 --> 07:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
rushed
 
07:29:46.468 --> 07:29:46.478 align:start position:0%
warped speeded sped
 
07:29:48.868 --> 07:29:48.878 align:start position:0%
because we got a pandemic on
 
07:29:53.590 --> 07:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
and the leisure of allowing long trials
 
07:29:55.510 --> 07:29:55.520 align:start position:0%
we just didn't have
 
07:29:56.948 --> 07:29:56.958 align:start position:0%
and so
 
07:30:01.670 --> 07:30:01.680 align:start position:0%
if there's not the usual depth of study
 
07:30:04.070 --> 07:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
in order to get the vaccines why now
 
07:30:04.080 --> 07:30:05.110 align:start position:0%
in order to get the vaccines why now
suddenly

07:30:05.110 --> 07:30:05.120 align:start position:0%
suddenly
 
07:30:06.468 --> 07:30:06.478 align:start position:0%
is it wrong
 
07:30:08.788 --> 07:30:08.798 align:start position:0%
to have ivermectin
 
07:30:10.388 --> 07:30:10.398 align:start position:0%
uh so i can't again i can't speak to
 
07:30:13.110 --> 07:30:13.120 align:start position:0%
that i'm not a clinician um at the cdc
 
07:30:15.590 --> 07:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that the cdc uh
 
07:30:15.600 --> 07:30:16.948 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that the cdc uh
would

07:30:16.948 --> 07:30:16.958 align:start position:0%
would
 
07:30:18.310 --> 07:30:18.320 align:start position:0%
believes that it would be permissible to
 
07:30:20.868 --> 07:30:20.878 align:start position:0%
use ivermectin within a clinical trial
 
07:30:23.190 --> 07:30:23.200 align:start position:0%
um but not outside of a clinical trial
 
07:30:26.230 --> 07:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
well the vaccines and boosters that i've
 
07:30:27.990 --> 07:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
gotten i don't think were clinical
 
07:30:31.510 --> 07:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
trials i think it was fast and dirty
 
07:30:33.590 --> 07:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
and i looked at the odds and that's what
 
07:30:36.708 --> 07:30:36.718 align:start position:0%
i chose to do but it was fast and dirty
 
07:30:36.718 --> 07:30:37.990 align:start position:0%
i chose to do but it was fast and dirty
and

07:30:37.990 --> 07:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:30:40.070 --> 07:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
we don't know if down the road there's
 
07:30:41.990 --> 07:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
going to be contra indications of
 
07:30:44.628 --> 07:30:44.638 align:start position:0%
something that's new but we do know
 
07:30:47.270 --> 07:30:47.280 align:start position:0%
ivermectin does not seem to be
 
07:30:47.280 --> 07:30:48.388 align:start position:0%
ivermectin does not seem to be
as

07:30:48.388 --> 07:30:48.398 align:start position:0%
as
 
07:30:50.948 --> 07:30:50.958 align:start position:0%
troublesome so i i just don't i it looks
 
07:30:52.388 --> 07:30:52.398 align:start position:0%
like there's two different standards
 
07:30:54.388 --> 07:30:54.398 align:start position:0%
could you could you help this liberal
 
07:30:56.150 --> 07:30:56.160 align:start position:0%
arts guy work through it
 
07:30:58.388 --> 07:30:58.398 align:start position:0%
i i again i'm not a clinician so i can't
 
07:31:01.110 --> 07:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
um i can't speak to the the uh clinical
 
07:31:03.270 --> 07:31:03.280 align:start position:0%
trial process what i can say is that
 
07:31:04.548 --> 07:31:04.558 align:start position:0%
there certainly are a lot of questions
 
07:31:07.110 --> 07:31:07.120 align:start position:0%
when it comes to coping 19 and um it's
 
07:31:08.628 --> 07:31:08.638 align:start position:0%
there are risk factors that we're all
 
07:31:10.150 --> 07:31:10.160 align:start position:0%
juggling i have a two-year-old that's
 
07:31:13.510 --> 07:31:13.520 align:start position:0%
not yet vaccine eligible and so um
 
07:31:16.548 --> 07:31:16.558 align:start position:0%
certainly certainly juggling a lot of
 
07:31:18.868 --> 07:31:18.878 align:start position:0%
risks right now thank you thank you so
 
07:31:18.878 --> 07:31:22.310 align:start position:0%
risks right now thank you thank you so
much

07:31:22.310 --> 07:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:31:25.190 --> 07:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
treya recognizes our old not old in the
 
07:31:27.990 --> 07:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
sense of elderly but our dear that's it
 
07:31:30.150 --> 07:31:30.160 align:start position:0%

our dear friend upon a minute paula
minihan

07:31:33.590 --> 07:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:31:35.750 --> 07:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
who's not old
 
07:31:42.868 --> 07:31:42.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:31:45.510 --> 07:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:31:48.708 --> 07:31:48.718 align:start position:0%
the number is now two because czech say
 
07:31:52.548 --> 07:31:52.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:32:06.468 --> 07:32:06.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:32:08.310 --> 07:32:08.320 align:start position:0%
good afternoon mr chairman members of
 
07:32:09.750 --> 07:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record paula
 
07:32:11.830 --> 07:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
minihan senior vice president state
 
07:32:12.948 --> 07:32:12.958 align:start position:0%
government relations for the new
 
07:32:14.788 --> 07:32:14.798 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital association
 
07:32:17.190 --> 07:32:17.200 align:start position:0%
the hospital association is opposed to
 
07:32:20.628 --> 07:32:20.638 align:start position:0%
house bill 2 10 22
 
07:32:23.510 --> 07:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
and we have consulted with all our
 
07:32:26.388 --> 07:32:26.398 align:start position:0%
hospital pharmacy directors as well and
 
07:32:28.150 --> 07:32:28.160 align:start position:0%
they are all expressing strong
 
07:32:29.750 --> 07:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
opposition to this
 
07:32:31.350 --> 07:32:31.360 align:start position:0%
allowing this drug to be used in this
 
07:32:33.430 --> 07:32:33.440 align:start position:0%
manner and the chief medical officers at
 
07:32:35.190 --> 07:32:35.200 align:start position:0%
our hospitals and clinical leaders have
 
07:32:37.270 --> 07:32:37.280 align:start position:0%
expressed similar concerns
 
07:32:39.270 --> 07:32:39.280 align:start position:0%
i will not reiterate what has been
 
07:32:41.110 --> 07:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
stated and was
 
07:32:43.590 --> 07:32:43.600 align:start position:0%
i think done very effectively by dr um
 
07:32:44.868 --> 07:32:44.878 align:start position:0%
kanerk but
 
07:32:47.270 --> 07:32:47.280 align:start position:0%
again the cdc the fda
 
07:32:50.628 --> 07:32:50.638 align:start position:0%
nih as well as other federal agencies do
 
07:32:53.590 --> 07:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
not believe that ivmectin is recommended
 
07:32:55.430 --> 07:32:55.440 align:start position:0%
or they indicated that it is not
 
07:32:58.070 --> 07:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
recommended to treat cope at 19.
 
07:33:00.788 --> 07:33:00.798 align:start position:0%
um and again it it requires clinical
 
07:33:03.750 --> 07:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
trials um they are currently assessing
 
07:33:06.150 --> 07:33:06.160 align:start position:0%
ivamectin tablets for the prevention or
 
07:33:09.190 --> 07:33:09.200 align:start position:0%
treatment of covid is ongoing i have
 
07:33:12.468 --> 07:33:12.478 align:start position:0%
attached some documentation from the cdc
 
07:33:15.190 --> 07:33:15.200 align:start position:0%
i think there are again some issues with
 
07:33:15.200 --> 07:33:15.990 align:start position:0%
i think there are again some issues with
um

07:33:15.990 --> 07:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:33:18.468 --> 07:33:18.478 align:start position:0%
the bill that have been stated by others
 
07:33:20.548 --> 07:33:20.558 align:start position:0%
relative to we don't understand exactly
 
07:33:23.270 --> 07:33:23.280 align:start position:0%
how the standing order would work
 
07:33:24.948 --> 07:33:24.958 align:start position:0%
and i believe that there are many new
 
07:33:27.350 --> 07:33:27.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire health care professionals some
 
07:33:29.270 --> 07:33:29.280 align:start position:0%
that will be testifying today and others
 
07:33:31.910 --> 07:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
that had to submit their testimony
 
07:33:35.350 --> 07:33:35.360 align:start position:0%
in opposition to this bill
 
07:33:37.830 --> 07:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
besides like i said we do have questions
 
07:33:39.910 --> 07:33:39.920 align:start position:0%
about the standing order we are opposed
 
07:33:41.670 --> 07:33:41.680 align:start position:0%
to this and on behalf of our hospitals
 
07:33:43.590 --> 07:33:43.600 align:start position:0%
we urge you to find
 
07:33:45.910 --> 07:33:45.920 align:start position:0%
house bill 1022 in expedient to
 
07:33:47.910 --> 07:33:47.920 align:start position:0%
legislate thank you would you take some
 
07:33:56.628 --> 07:33:56.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:33:58.230 --> 07:33:58.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i used to be an
 
07:34:00.548 --> 07:34:00.558 align:start position:0%
analyst i'm full of questions
 
07:34:02.388 --> 07:34:02.398 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the question
 
07:34:04.230 --> 07:34:04.240 align:start position:0%
um right now we're at a very interesting
 
07:34:06.150 --> 07:34:06.160 align:start position:0%
point where where there's more debate
 
07:34:07.670 --> 07:34:07.680 align:start position:0%
about science than we've ever had in the
 
07:34:09.350 --> 07:34:09.360 align:start position:0%
past which is good
 
07:34:10.628 --> 07:34:10.638 align:start position:0%
unfortunately there's some growing
 
07:34:10.638 --> 07:34:11.990 align:start position:0%
unfortunately there's some growing
distrust

07:34:11.990 --> 07:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
distrust
 
07:34:14.628 --> 07:34:14.638 align:start position:0%
i was curious if you could tell us if
 
07:34:17.830 --> 07:34:17.840 align:start position:0%
there's any any extra financial bonuses
 
07:34:19.510 --> 07:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
or any extra
 
07:34:21.190 --> 07:34:21.200 align:start position:0%
payment that comes to our hospital
 
07:34:23.430 --> 07:34:23.440 align:start position:0%
systems for certain treatments or
 
07:34:27.270 --> 07:34:27.280 align:start position:0%
certain indications during this pandemic
 
07:34:29.110 --> 07:34:29.120 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure i completely understand
 
07:34:31.030 --> 07:34:31.040 align:start position:0%
your question but we have been asked
 
07:34:33.030 --> 07:34:33.040 align:start position:0%
this um different ways
 
07:34:36.788 --> 07:34:36.798 align:start position:0%
what um is cor is accurate um there's
 
07:34:38.868 --> 07:34:38.878 align:start position:0%
been some mis understanding i think
 
07:34:42.708 --> 07:34:42.718 align:start position:0%
relative to um payments for medicare
 
07:34:46.070 --> 07:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
they provide a um add-on
 
07:34:46.080 --> 07:34:47.110 align:start position:0%
they provide a um add-on
payment

07:34:47.110 --> 07:34:47.120 align:start position:0%
payment
 
07:34:49.590 --> 07:34:49.600 align:start position:0%
if um the individual has a coveted
 
07:34:52.070 --> 07:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
diagnosis and with the understanding
 
07:34:54.310 --> 07:34:54.320 align:start position:0%
that that is intended it does not cover
 
07:34:56.468 --> 07:34:56.478 align:start position:0%
but it intended to cover
 
07:34:58.868 --> 07:34:58.878 align:start position:0%
some of the additional costs associated
 
07:35:01.670 --> 07:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
with treating covid patients including
 
07:35:05.110 --> 07:35:05.120 align:start position:0%
all the ppe etc that is required
 
07:35:07.510 --> 07:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
to safely care for them so
 
07:35:09.830 --> 07:35:09.840 align:start position:0%
that is medicare only it is a small
 
07:35:12.788 --> 07:35:12.798 align:start position:0%
amount it is nothing that has been
 
07:35:16.070 --> 07:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
that is anywhere near covering the cost
 
07:35:18.628 --> 07:35:18.638 align:start position:0%
because coveted patients unfortunately
 
07:35:18.638 --> 07:35:19.510 align:start position:0%
because coveted patients unfortunately
some

07:35:19.510 --> 07:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
some
 
07:35:21.670 --> 07:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
are in the hospital for a very long
 
07:35:24.788 --> 07:35:24.798 align:start position:0%
length of stay when they are
 
07:35:26.948 --> 07:35:26.958 align:start position:0%
diagnosed and then they're trying to
 
07:35:26.958 --> 07:35:27.990 align:start position:0%
diagnosed and then they're trying to
recover

07:35:27.990 --> 07:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
recover
 
07:35:30.230 --> 07:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
so they continue to be in the hospital i
 
07:35:32.788 --> 07:35:32.798 align:start position:0%
did want to also say for the record
 
07:35:35.270 --> 07:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
that neil meehan the chief physician
 
07:35:35.280 --> 07:35:36.708 align:start position:0%
that neil meehan the chief physician
executive

07:35:36.708 --> 07:35:36.718 align:start position:0%
executive
 
07:35:39.190 --> 07:35:39.200 align:start position:0%
for exeter hospital is going to be
 
07:35:41.910 --> 07:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
submitting information to the
 
07:35:41.920 --> 07:35:43.190 align:start position:0%
submitting information to the
committee

07:35:43.190 --> 07:35:43.200 align:start position:0%
committee
 
07:35:44.948 --> 07:35:44.958 align:start position:0%
they just did not have an opportunity to
 
07:35:46.948 --> 07:35:46.958 align:start position:0%
submit it um before the hearing but that
 
07:35:49.830 --> 07:35:49.840 align:start position:0%
will be coming um he is opposed as well
 
07:35:51.350 --> 07:35:51.360 align:start position:0%
to the to the bill
 
07:35:53.590 --> 07:35:53.600 align:start position:0%
would you like to follow up yes please
 
07:35:55.110 --> 07:35:55.120 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
07:35:57.990 --> 07:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
thank you and then my follow-up is just
 
07:36:00.070 --> 07:36:00.080 align:start position:0%
are the hospitals still being overrun
 
07:36:01.990 --> 07:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
with patients and would it be helpful to
 
07:36:04.230 --> 07:36:04.240 align:start position:0%
have more options to divert them before
 
07:36:06.788 --> 07:36:06.798 align:start position:0%
they need hospitalization
 
07:36:08.948 --> 07:36:08.958 align:start position:0%
the hospitals are
 
07:36:10.708 --> 07:36:10.718 align:start position:0%
overwhelmed by
 
07:36:14.150 --> 07:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
many patients not just covet patients um
 
07:36:16.310 --> 07:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
i don't have the i do have the number
 
07:36:20.070 --> 07:36:20.080 align:start position:0%
today um i think it's 400 hold on i had
 
07:36:27.270 --> 07:36:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:36:31.110 --> 07:36:31.120 align:start position:0%
there are as of last night 409 patients
 
07:36:34.230 --> 07:36:34.240 align:start position:0%
with covid in the hospital another 147
 
07:36:36.388 --> 07:36:36.398 align:start position:0%
recovering as i indicated
 
07:36:39.590 --> 07:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
after you after i think 21 days they now
 
07:36:41.750 --> 07:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
are considered cover recovering if they
 
07:36:43.190 --> 07:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
are still in the hospital because they
 
07:36:44.628 --> 07:36:44.638 align:start position:0%
don't technically have coveted but
 
07:36:46.230 --> 07:36:46.240 align:start position:0%
they're still very sick
 
07:36:48.468 --> 07:36:48.478 align:start position:0%
sixteen are in the emergency rooms
 
07:36:50.230 --> 07:36:50.240 align:start position:0%
waiting to be admitted
 
07:36:52.628 --> 07:36:52.638 align:start position:0%
um and another statistic that i think is
 
07:36:55.270 --> 07:36:55.280 align:start position:0%
important for the record of those there
 
07:36:58.510 --> 07:36:58.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:37:02.788 --> 07:37:02.798 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated um admissions 43.5
 
07:37:05.430 --> 07:37:05.440 align:start position:0%
fully vaccinated 22 percent partially
 
07:37:07.030 --> 07:37:07.040 align:start position:0%
vaccinated 20
 
07:37:09.990 --> 07:37:10.000 align:start position:0%
unknown 13.9 percent
 
07:37:12.388 --> 07:37:12.398 align:start position:0%
and um i just thought that was important
 
07:37:13.830 --> 07:37:13.840 align:start position:0%
for the record because i think that was
 
07:37:16.788 --> 07:37:16.798 align:start position:0%
another um misstatement that was um
 
07:37:22.150 --> 07:37:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:37:24.070 --> 07:37:24.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman paulus good to see
 
07:37:25.670 --> 07:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
you nice to see you
 
07:37:27.990 --> 07:37:28.000 align:start position:0%
in regards to the hospital emissions the
 
07:37:31.510 --> 07:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
409 are those patients active with covet
 
07:37:33.910 --> 07:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
or once they become no longer active in
 
07:37:35.670 --> 07:37:35.680 align:start position:0%
their recovery
 
07:37:37.830 --> 07:37:37.840 align:start position:0%
they move off to 409 so therefore the
 
07:37:40.388 --> 07:37:40.398 align:start position:0%
409 is only the ones with active covet
 
07:37:41.750 --> 07:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
not those who've been admitted to the
 
07:37:43.190 --> 07:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
hospital still there because they had a
 
07:37:45.910 --> 07:37:45.920 align:start position:0%
coveted infection
 
07:37:50.070 --> 07:37:50.080 align:start position:0%
they are active admissions right now 409
 
07:37:54.230 --> 07:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
the 147 are the recovered yep so you've
 
07:37:55.750 --> 07:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
got to add those two together plus the
 
07:37:59.030 --> 07:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
16 waiting to be admitted thank you
 
07:38:00.468 --> 07:38:00.478 align:start position:0%
at the hospital yes to answer
 
07:38:01.750 --> 07:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
representative leon's question the
 
07:38:04.388 --> 07:38:04.398 align:start position:0%
hospitals are overwhelmed with patients
 
07:38:07.430 --> 07:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
but um covered and and non-covet
 
07:38:11.270 --> 07:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
patients that unfortunately um due to
 
07:38:13.750 --> 07:38:13.760 align:start position:0%
some of the issues that uh we had to
 
07:38:15.510 --> 07:38:15.520 align:start position:0%
reduce the number the
 
07:38:18.388 --> 07:38:18.398 align:start position:0%
elective surgeries last year that
 
07:38:21.030 --> 07:38:21.040 align:start position:0%
unfortunately patients were had delayed
 
07:38:23.350 --> 07:38:23.360 align:start position:0%
their care and now they are much sicker
 
07:38:25.910 --> 07:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
and now in the hospital so
 
07:38:25.920 --> 07:38:26.948 align:start position:0%
and now in the hospital so
but

07:38:26.948 --> 07:38:26.958 align:start position:0%
but
 
07:38:28.788 --> 07:38:28.798 align:start position:0%
they are our healthcare heroes and they
 
07:38:30.070 --> 07:38:30.080 align:start position:0%
are working
 
07:38:32.868 --> 07:38:32.878 align:start position:0%
tirelessly to take care of patients
 
07:38:35.190 --> 07:38:35.200 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes the moving closer
 
07:38:37.750 --> 07:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
to the microphone representative delemus
 
07:38:40.628 --> 07:38:40.638 align:start position:0%
for one question with no follow-up thank
 
07:38:42.868 --> 07:38:42.878 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman
 
07:38:45.430 --> 07:38:45.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my time
 
07:38:47.430 --> 07:38:47.440 align:start position:0%
apparently according to vigil access
 
07:38:49.510 --> 07:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
which is tm the world health
 
07:38:52.548 --> 07:38:52.558 align:start position:0%
organization the fda and merck
 
07:38:56.910 --> 07:38:56.920 align:start position:0%
ivermectin um since 1992 adverse events
 
07:38:59.830 --> 07:38:59.840 align:start position:0%
5840 coveted
 
07:39:03.548 --> 07:39:03.558 align:start position:0%
vaccines 2878
 
07:39:03.558 --> 07:39:05.190 align:start position:0%
vaccines 2878
362.

07:39:05.190 --> 07:39:05.200 align:start position:0%
362.
 
07:39:05.200 --> 07:39:06.310 align:start position:0%
362.
so

07:39:06.310 --> 07:39:06.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:39:08.150 --> 07:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
07:39:12.230 --> 07:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:39:12.240 --> 07:39:14.388 align:start position:0%
 
adversity

07:39:14.388 --> 07:39:14.398 align:start position:0%
adversity
 
07:39:17.750 --> 07:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh for people trying taking ivermectin
 
07:39:20.230 --> 07:39:20.240 align:start position:0%
since it seems to be less dangerous than
 
07:39:22.948 --> 07:39:22.958 align:start position:0%
taking aspirin as opposed to
 
07:39:24.388 --> 07:39:24.398 align:start position:0%
vaccines and i'm not saying people
 
07:39:26.150 --> 07:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
shouldn't take vaccines that should be
 
07:39:28.628 --> 07:39:28.638 align:start position:0%
completely up to a person but my
 
07:39:29.750 --> 07:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
question is
 
07:39:32.548 --> 07:39:32.558 align:start position:0%
why would such an extremely
 
07:39:35.510 --> 07:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
small number i mean 20 deaths as opposed
 
07:39:37.468 --> 07:39:37.478 align:start position:0%
to 14
 
07:39:41.270 --> 07:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
774 deaths with vaccines why would there
 
07:39:46.150 --> 07:39:46.160 align:start position:0%
be any pushback on people being able to
 
07:39:49.990 --> 07:39:50.000 align:start position:0%
get ivermectin i think um dr kenorick
 
07:39:51.670 --> 07:39:51.680 align:start position:0%
answered it better but also i think the
 
07:39:53.910 --> 07:39:53.920 align:start position:0%
denominator is very important i don't
 
07:39:56.070 --> 07:39:56.080 align:start position:0%
know how many people have
 
07:39:58.788 --> 07:39:58.798 align:start position:0%
taken ivermectin but a lot more people i
 
07:40:02.070 --> 07:40:02.080 align:start position:0%
suspect have received the covet 19
 
07:40:04.230 --> 07:40:04.240 align:start position:0%
vaccine worldwide
 
07:40:05.510 --> 07:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
and again
 
07:40:08.948 --> 07:40:08.958 align:start position:0%
if it's not efficacious then it it does
 
07:40:12.468 --> 07:40:12.478 align:start position:0%
not make sense for a doctor to prescribe
 
07:40:14.310 --> 07:40:14.320 align:start position:0%
it because they are trying to help their
 
07:40:17.830 --> 07:40:17.840 align:start position:0%
patients so that's the problem is it is
 
07:40:21.110 --> 07:40:21.120 align:start position:0%
not recommended for for treatment of
 
07:40:22.868 --> 07:40:22.878 align:start position:0%
covid and that is
 
07:40:25.510 --> 07:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
that's until the clinical trials are
 
07:40:25.520 --> 07:40:26.708 align:start position:0%
that's until the clinical trials are
completed

07:40:26.708 --> 07:40:26.718 align:start position:0%
completed
 
07:40:28.548 --> 07:40:28.558 align:start position:0%
um that is
 
07:40:28.558 --> 07:40:30.708 align:start position:0%
um that is
the

07:40:30.708 --> 07:40:30.718 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:40:33.190 --> 07:40:33.200 align:start position:0%
the recommendation and the guidance from
 
07:40:35.030 --> 07:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
the federal um
 
07:40:37.510 --> 07:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
the federal agencies thank you sure
 
07:40:39.430 --> 07:40:39.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much miss minihan now
 
07:40:42.948 --> 07:40:42.958 align:start position:0%
here's the deal yes it's ten past five
 
07:40:45.190 --> 07:40:45.200 align:start position:0%
we're closing at 5 30 or we'll be locked
 
07:40:46.788 --> 07:40:46.798 align:start position:0%
in for the night and you'll be subject
 
07:40:52.070 --> 07:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:40:52.080 --> 07:40:53.350 align:start position:0%
 
no

07:40:53.350 --> 07:40:53.360 align:start position:0%
no
 
07:40:55.030 --> 07:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
you cannot have your teddy bear and
 
07:40:57.110 --> 07:40:57.120 align:start position:0%
you'll miss your tv shows and there's no
 
07:40:57.120 --> 07:40:58.150 align:start position:0%
you'll miss your tv shows and there's no
food

07:40:58.150 --> 07:40:58.160 align:start position:0%
food
 
07:40:58.160 --> 07:40:58.868 align:start position:0%
food
so

07:40:58.868 --> 07:40:58.878 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:41:02.150 --> 07:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
all the um representatives who have
 
07:41:05.670 --> 07:41:05.680 align:start position:0%
signed up have spoken all but one of we
 
07:41:08.310 --> 07:41:08.320 align:start position:0%
could call representatives from agencies
 
07:41:10.310 --> 07:41:10.320 align:start position:0%
or call them lobbyists all but one have
 
07:41:10.320 --> 07:41:11.590 align:start position:0%
or call them lobbyists all but one have
spoken

07:41:11.590 --> 07:41:11.600 align:start position:0%
spoken
 
07:41:14.310 --> 07:41:14.320 align:start position:0%
all doctors have spoken
 
07:41:16.548 --> 07:41:16.558 align:start position:0%
i do very much one in the 20 minutes

07:41:58.548 --> 07:41:58.558 align:start position:0%
just a side note
 
07:42:00.548 --> 07:42:00.558 align:start position:0%
my colleague is genetically tested so he
 
07:42:02.310 --> 07:42:02.320 align:start position:0%
can safely take over back to for
 
07:42:02.320 --> 07:42:04.468 align:start position:0%
can safely take over back to for
heartworm

07:42:04.468 --> 07:42:04.478 align:start position:0%
heartworm
 
07:42:07.510 --> 07:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
regarding this whole process
 
07:42:11.510 --> 07:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
i remember in 2010 and 2011 being here
 
07:42:14.150 --> 07:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
talking to the people that were setting
 
07:42:18.150 --> 07:42:18.160 align:start position:0%
our guidelines for lime treatment
 
07:42:20.628 --> 07:42:20.638 align:start position:0%
making lime treatment safe
 
07:42:23.430 --> 07:42:23.440 align:start position:0%
for people to heal in new hampshire
 
07:42:26.310 --> 07:42:26.320 align:start position:0%
we're back to the same principle
 
07:42:29.030 --> 07:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
making possibilities safe for people to
 
07:42:30.628 --> 07:42:30.638 align:start position:0%
heal in new hampshire
 
07:42:32.548 --> 07:42:32.558 align:start position:0%
i can tell you antidotal stories that
 
07:42:35.590 --> 07:42:35.600 align:start position:0%
don't amount to jack squat
 
07:42:38.230 --> 07:42:38.240 align:start position:0%
i can tell you that we do
 
07:42:40.548 --> 07:42:40.558 align:start position:0%
want people to heal and we want them to
 
07:42:42.868 --> 07:42:42.878 align:start position:0%
have opportunities to heal and we've

health and fully vaccinated with modern
 
07:43:56.548 --> 07:43:56.558 align:start position:0%
at two shots plus modernity booster i'm
 
07:43:58.548 --> 07:43:58.558 align:start position:0%
not a non-vaxxer
 
07:44:00.628 --> 07:44:00.638 align:start position:0%
i've been following the imas plus home
 
07:44:03.510 --> 07:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
treatment protocol provided by flccc
 
07:44:07.430 --> 07:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
since the beginning of january 2022
 
07:44:08.388 --> 07:44:08.398 align:start position:0%
i have
 
07:44:10.388 --> 07:44:10.398 align:start position:0%
i've i'm having no problem following the
 
07:44:12.788 --> 07:44:12.798 align:start position:0%
immune the immune fortifying supportive
 
07:44:14.548 --> 07:44:14.558 align:start position:0%
therapy portion of the protocol since
 
07:44:16.070 --> 07:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
all five of the medications which are
 
07:44:18.388 --> 07:44:18.398 align:start position:0%
mostly vitamins and so forth that dr
 
07:44:20.468 --> 07:44:20.478 align:start position:0%
merrick mentioned are over the counter
 
07:44:22.388 --> 07:44:22.398 align:start position:0%
and relatively inexpensive
 
07:44:24.070 --> 07:44:24.080 align:start position:0%
if i begin to
 
07:44:25.750 --> 07:44:25.760 align:start position:0%
experience symptoms i want to be able to
 
07:44:28.468 --> 07:44:28.478 align:start position:0%
add in my wife by the way i want to be
 
07:44:30.388 --> 07:44:30.398 align:start position:0%
able to add the antiviral portion using
 
07:44:32.548 --> 07:44:32.558 align:start position:0%
ivermectin my physician in my hospital
 
07:44:34.788 --> 07:44:34.798 align:start position:0%
only offer monoclonal antibody treatment
 
07:44:37.110 --> 07:44:37.120 align:start position:0%
to hopefully prevent hospitalization
 
07:44:39.110 --> 07:44:39.120 align:start position:0%
however i prefer to use ivermectin in
 
07:44:40.388 --> 07:44:40.398 align:start position:0%
the hopes of beating the virus in the
 
07:44:42.230 --> 07:44:42.240 align:start position:0%
first five to seven days and not
 
07:44:43.910 --> 07:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
requiring antibody treatment or
 
07:44:43.920 --> 07:44:45.510 align:start position:0%
requiring antibody treatment or
hospitalization

07:44:45.510 --> 07:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
hospitalization
 
07:44:47.830 --> 07:44:47.840 align:start position:0%
i also checked with my pharmacy and was
 
07:44:49.670 --> 07:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
advised that they will not fill a
 
07:44:52.230 --> 07:44:52.240 align:start position:0%
doctor's prescription for ivermectin
 
07:44:55.510 --> 07:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
as part of a covit 19 treatment protocol
 
07:44:57.510 --> 07:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
i'm assuming the reason why ivormecne is
 
07:44:59.750 --> 07:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
being withheld due to the cdc advisory
 
07:45:01.350 --> 07:45:01.360 align:start position:0%
which other people have talked about and
 
07:45:03.110 --> 07:45:03.120 align:start position:0%
i gave you a copy with my
 
07:45:03.120 --> 07:45:04.388 align:start position:0%
i gave you a copy with my
presentation

07:45:04.388 --> 07:45:04.398 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
07:45:06.868 --> 07:45:06.878 align:start position:0%
i've attached a copy of this oh yeah i'm
 
07:45:09.350 --> 07:45:09.360 align:start position:0%
not qualified to comment medically or
 
07:45:11.590 --> 07:45:11.600 align:start position:0%
scientifically on that advisory
 
07:45:13.670 --> 07:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
others who are qualified find the
 
07:45:16.070 --> 07:45:16.080 align:start position:0%
advisory to be premature ill-advised and
 
07:45:17.830 --> 07:45:17.840 align:start position:0%
misleading in the light of a pandemic
 
07:45:19.590 --> 07:45:19.600 align:start position:0%
which is killing many americans every
 
07:45:19.600 --> 07:45:20.468 align:start position:0%
which is killing many americans every
day

07:45:20.468 --> 07:45:20.478 align:start position:0%
day
 
07:45:21.990 --> 07:45:22.000 align:start position:0%
like today
 
07:45:23.910 --> 07:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
while proven home treatments are ignored
 
07:45:27.110 --> 07:45:27.120 align:start position:0%
delayed or otherwise presented from use
 
07:45:28.948 --> 07:45:28.958 align:start position:0%
in a recent new book and this is a new
 
07:45:30.070 --> 07:45:30.080 align:start position:0%
new book
 
07:45:31.830 --> 07:45:31.840 align:start position:0%
i'd advise everybody to take a look at
 
07:45:34.150 --> 07:45:34.160 align:start position:0%
it if you can get one
 
07:45:35.750 --> 07:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
it's called overcoming the cove of
 
07:45:37.590 --> 07:45:37.600 align:start position:0%
darkness how two doctors successfully
 
07:45:39.750 --> 07:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
treated seven thousand patients it was
 
07:45:42.150 --> 07:45:42.160 align:start position:0%
written by doctors brian tyson and
 
07:45:43.830 --> 07:45:43.840 align:start position:0%
george fareed and i want to mention that
 
07:45:45.510 --> 07:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
george fareed testified to the united
 
07:45:47.030 --> 07:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
states senate
 
07:45:48.868 --> 07:45:48.878 align:start position:0%
the and this is well i'm going to skip
 
07:45:50.468 --> 07:45:50.478 align:start position:0%
that because you can read it you've got
 
07:45:52.948 --> 07:45:52.958 align:start position:0%
30 more seconds sir okay the treatments
 
07:45:54.708 --> 07:45:54.718 align:start position:0%
used by these two heroic physicians
 
07:45:56.468 --> 07:45:56.478 align:start position:0%
included either hydroxychloroquine or
 
07:45:58.628 --> 07:45:58.638 align:start position:0%
ivermectin doctors tyson and fareed
 
07:46:00.230 --> 07:46:00.240 align:start position:0%
stand together with many other doctors
 
07:46:01.830 --> 07:46:01.840 align:start position:0%
and health professionals around the
 
07:46:03.590 --> 07:46:03.600 align:start position:0%
world saving lives and similar treatment
 
07:46:06.230 --> 07:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
protocols the fda cdc dr fauci and
 
07:46:08.388 --> 07:46:08.398 align:start position:0%
president biden's covet task force will
 
07:46:10.628 --> 07:46:10.638 align:start position:0%
not give these life-saving examples of
 
07:46:12.548 --> 07:46:12.558 align:start position:0%
pre-treatment the light of day
 
07:46:14.310 --> 07:46:14.320 align:start position:0%
these examples are being carried out by
 
07:46:16.310 --> 07:46:16.320 align:start position:0%
highly experienced physicians and
 
07:46:17.910 --> 07:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
scientists the fact that these
 
07:46:19.750 --> 07:46:19.760 align:start position:0%
procedures have been ignored withheld
 
07:46:22.310 --> 07:46:22.320 align:start position:0%
and vilified defies long-established
 
07:46:24.070 --> 07:46:24.080 align:start position:0%
scientific problem-solving methods
 
07:46:26.070 --> 07:46:26.080 align:start position:0%
common sense and any semblance of
 
07:46:28.230 --> 07:46:28.240 align:start position:0%
compassion for the patients and their
 
07:46:30.628 --> 07:46:30.638 align:start position:0%
doctors thank you sir thank you so much

thank you sir and thank you all for
 
07:46:41.430 --> 07:46:41.440 align:start position:0%
allowing me to speak here
 
07:46:44.310 --> 07:46:44.320 align:start position:0%
um i'm not a doctor but i have been
 
07:46:46.468 --> 07:46:46.478 align:start position:0%
following this for two years since this
 
07:46:46.478 --> 07:46:47.990 align:start position:0%
following this for two years since this
whole

07:46:47.990 --> 07:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
whole
 
07:46:49.670 --> 07:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
pandemic started
 
07:46:49.680 --> 07:46:50.628 align:start position:0%
pandemic started
and

07:46:50.628 --> 07:46:50.638 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:46:52.788 --> 07:46:52.798 align:start position:0%
people have mentioned treatments no
 
07:46:54.788 --> 07:46:54.798 align:start position:0%
treatments what's going on you get
 
07:46:57.030 --> 07:46:57.040 align:start position:0%
covert go home sit around for 14 days
 
07:46:58.708 --> 07:46:58.718 align:start position:0%
and i hope you feel better and then if
 
07:47:01.030 --> 07:47:01.040 align:start position:0%
you don't you get thrown in the hospital
 
07:47:02.388 --> 07:47:02.398 align:start position:0%
we got to follow
 
07:47:04.468 --> 07:47:04.478 align:start position:0%
there's a reason why ivermectin is not
 
07:47:05.830 --> 07:47:05.840 align:start position:0%
being used here
 
07:47:07.590 --> 07:47:07.600 align:start position:0%
and it's i'm surprised it has been
 
07:47:09.430 --> 07:47:09.440 align:start position:0%
brought up once yet but it's just follow
 
07:47:10.388 --> 07:47:10.398 align:start position:0%
the money
 
07:47:12.230 --> 07:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
you know doctor from virginia mentioned
 
07:47:14.708 --> 07:47:14.718 align:start position:0%
that it's two three cents a pill
 
07:47:16.708 --> 07:47:16.718 align:start position:0%
it's cheap it's a third world country
 
07:47:19.350 --> 07:47:19.360 align:start position:0%
drug that has done so much good since
 
07:47:23.030 --> 07:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
1987. it's fda approved
 
07:47:25.910 --> 07:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
the minister here used it i used it i'm
 
07:47:27.350 --> 07:47:27.360 align:start position:0%

07:48:53.350 --> 07:48:53.360 align:start position:0%
that look that up look these doctors up
 
07:48:55.510 --> 07:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
there's so much you guys can be heroes
 
07:48:56.868 --> 07:48:56.878 align:start position:0%
okay i'm assuming the people wearing the
 
07:48:58.548 --> 07:48:58.558 align:start position:0%
masks are the ones that don't want this
 
07:48:58.558 --> 07:48:59.910 align:start position:0%
masks are the ones that don't want this
approved

07:48:59.910 --> 07:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
approved
 
07:49:01.750 --> 07:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
nobody that spoke up against this gave
 
07:49:04.468 --> 07:49:04.478 align:start position:0%
any other really solid reasons this is
 
07:49:06.230 --> 07:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
this is safe
 
07:49:08.230 --> 07:49:08.240 align:start position:0%
okay and the last thing i want to say is
 
07:49:11.430 --> 07:49:11.440 align:start position:0%
i'm getting tired of every single day
 
07:49:14.070 --> 07:49:14.080 align:start position:0%
this president of the united states
 
07:49:16.708 --> 07:49:16.718 align:start position:0%
begging us to get vaccinated and telling
 
07:49:19.350 --> 07:49:19.360 align:start position:0%
us how safe it is thank you mr grover
 
07:49:21.030 --> 07:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
appreciate your
 
07:49:23.190 --> 07:49:23.200 align:start position:0%
coming to speak to us ken
 
07:49:27.590 --> 07:49:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:49:29.670 --> 07:49:29.680 align:start position:0%
ken had to leave next
 
07:49:29.680 --> 07:49:31.270 align:start position:0%
ken had to leave next
heather

07:49:31.270 --> 07:49:31.280 align:start position:0%
heather
 
07:49:33.510 --> 07:49:33.520 align:start position:0%
mullen marlins yeah
 
07:49:35.270 --> 07:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
thank you so much i was hoping you'd get
 
07:49:37.990 --> 07:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:49:39.910 --> 07:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
okay so i'm actually an investigative
 
07:49:41.430 --> 07:49:41.440 align:start position:0%
reporter and i work for a national
 
07:49:43.270 --> 07:49:43.280 align:start position:0%
network so i've actually been very
 
07:49:45.190 --> 07:49:45.200 align:start position:0%
fortunate to have been able to spend a
 
07:49:47.670 --> 07:49:47.680 align:start position:0%
considerable amount of time into
 
07:49:49.510 --> 07:49:49.520 align:start position:0%
investigating the pandemic interviewing
 
07:49:51.750 --> 07:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
doctors patients you name it over the
 
07:49:51.760 --> 07:49:52.788 align:start position:0%
doctors patients you name it over the
last

07:49:52.788 --> 07:49:52.798 align:start position:0%
last
 
07:49:54.788 --> 07:49:54.798 align:start position:0%
two years
 
07:49:55.990 --> 07:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
one thing i want to talk about that
 
07:49:58.468 --> 07:49:58.478 align:start position:0%
hasn't been brought up is the censorship
 
07:50:00.150 --> 07:50:00.160 align:start position:0%
of this information
 
07:50:01.750 --> 07:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
so several people that have got up here
 
07:50:03.830 --> 07:50:03.840 align:start position:0%
have made you know some assertions that
 
07:50:05.990 --> 07:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
the data is not there i can assure you
 
07:50:07.910 --> 07:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
the data is there but there are groups
 
07:50:10.230 --> 07:50:10.240 align:start position:0%
that are trying to keep you
 
07:50:13.670 --> 07:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
from accessing the data on ivermectin
 
07:50:16.868 --> 07:50:16.878 align:start position:0%
um and i can take it back to 2020 when i
 
07:50:18.548 --> 07:50:18.558 align:start position:0%
actually had kovid before there ever was
 
07:50:20.708 --> 07:50:20.718 align:start position:0%
a vaccine there was actually a group on
 
07:50:23.350 --> 07:50:23.360 align:start position:0%
facebook that had hundreds of thousands
 
07:50:25.350 --> 07:50:25.360 align:start position:0%
of people who had
 
07:50:27.190 --> 07:50:27.200 align:start position:0%
been considered coveted survivors and
 
07:50:29.110 --> 07:50:29.120 align:start position:0%
they were all in this group sharing
 
07:50:30.230 --> 07:50:30.240 align:start position:0%
treatment specifically
 
07:50:30.240 --> 07:50:31.910 align:start position:0%
treatment specifically
hydroxychloroquine

07:50:31.910 --> 07:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
hydroxychloroquine
 
07:50:34.070 --> 07:50:34.080 align:start position:0%
that group one day when it reached just
 
07:50:36.230 --> 07:50:36.240 align:start position:0%
about a million people was instantly
 
07:50:38.628 --> 07:50:38.638 align:start position:0%
removed by facebook
 
07:50:40.708 --> 07:50:40.718 align:start position:0%
a little background for you
 
07:50:43.270 --> 07:50:43.280 align:start position:0%
facebook in uh february of 2020 when
 
07:50:45.430 --> 07:50:45.440 align:start position:0%
this pandemic kicked off started having
 
07:50:47.990 --> 07:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
this sort of fact check program right uh
 
07:50:50.070 --> 07:50:50.080 align:start position:0%
many people don't know that uh thompson
 
07:50:51.910 --> 07:50:51.920 align:start position:0%
reuters is one of the biggest fact
 
07:50:55.110 --> 07:50:55.120 align:start position:0%
checkers for facebook that go and censor
 
07:50:58.070 --> 07:50:58.080 align:start position:0%
medical misinformation well the ceo and
 
07:50:59.990 --> 07:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
founder of uh
 
07:51:01.830 --> 07:51:01.840 align:start position:0%
thompson reuters is also on the board
 
07:51:03.670 --> 07:51:03.680 align:start position:0%
for pfizer so there's a little bit of a
 
07:51:06.150 --> 07:51:06.160 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest when you have
 
07:51:06.160 --> 07:51:06.868 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest when you have
the

07:51:06.868 --> 07:51:06.878 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:51:08.948 --> 07:51:08.958 align:start position:0%
board of director for pfizer censoring
 
07:51:11.110 --> 07:51:11.120 align:start position:0%
medical information specifically stories
 
07:51:13.270 --> 07:51:13.280 align:start position:0%
pertaining to hydroxychloroquine and
 
07:51:15.430 --> 07:51:15.440 align:start position:0%
ivermectin so that data is not being
 
07:51:17.910 --> 07:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
allowed to circulate on social media
 
07:51:20.708 --> 07:51:20.718 align:start position:0%
platforms as well as media networks how
 
07:51:21.990 --> 07:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
often do you turn on good morning
 
07:51:23.590 --> 07:51:23.600 align:start position:0%
america and it said this segment is
 
07:51:25.590 --> 07:51:25.600 align:start position:0%
brought to you by pfizer there's another
 
07:51:28.310 --> 07:51:28.320 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest so you have these
 
07:51:29.910 --> 07:51:29.920 align:start position:0%
big organizations and big pharma
 
07:51:31.910 --> 07:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
companies keeping you guys from the
 
07:51:34.070 --> 07:51:34.080 align:start position:0%
actual information that you should see
 
07:51:36.030 --> 07:51:36.040 align:start position:0%
um regarding ivermectin and
 
07:51:38.310 --> 07:51:38.320 align:start position:0%
hydroxychloroquine um there have been
 
07:51:40.708 --> 07:51:40.718 align:start position:0%
studies and i'm more than happy to send
 
07:51:42.150 --> 07:51:42.160 align:start position:0%
you this but i actually just found out
 
07:51:43.990 --> 07:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
about this hearing yesterday night i got
 
07:51:45.430 --> 07:51:45.440 align:start position:0%
in at like two in the morning and i was
 
07:51:47.750 --> 07:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
like this is so important because i want
 
07:51:49.110 --> 07:51:49.120 align:start position:0%
to thank each and every one of you
 
07:51:51.430 --> 07:51:51.440 align:start position:0%
because regardless of your political
 
07:51:54.070 --> 07:51:54.080 align:start position:0%
affiliation this medicine can save you
 
07:51:55.910 --> 07:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
and your family members and i cannot
 
07:51:58.070 --> 07:51:58.080 align:start position:0%
stress that enough thank you so much you
 
07:52:00.388 --> 07:52:00.398 align:start position:0%
guys need to you know thank you so much
 
07:52:03.110 --> 07:52:03.120 align:start position:0%
diligence and research thank you so much
 
07:52:05.190 --> 07:52:05.200 align:start position:0%
and please send us that stuff
 
07:52:06.868 --> 07:52:06.878 align:start position:0%
i would like that you're like a point of
 
07:52:08.548 --> 07:52:08.558 align:start position:0%
contact where i can get one email if you
 
07:52:09.990 --> 07:52:10.000 align:start position:0%
can sort of like
 
07:52:13.670 --> 07:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
yep yep check with somebody thank you
 
07:52:17.110 --> 07:52:17.120 align:start position:0%
clara symbolisti did i say it right yes
 
07:52:18.708 --> 07:52:18.718 align:start position:0%
you did wow
 
07:52:20.708 --> 07:52:20.718 align:start position:0%
but i did provide you with the planet
 
07:52:22.468 --> 07:52:22.478 align:start position:0%
you oh
 
07:52:24.708 --> 07:52:24.718 align:start position:0%
okay my name is claris and listi thank
 
07:52:26.070 --> 07:52:26.080 align:start position:0%
you for letting me speak i live in
 
07:52:27.990 --> 07:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
rochester i'm here speaking in support
 
07:52:30.150 --> 07:52:30.160 align:start position:0%
of the bill just last week project
 
07:52:32.548 --> 07:52:32.558 align:start position:0%
veritas released important documents
 
07:52:34.468 --> 07:52:34.478 align:start position:0%
revealing the truth about how this
 
07:52:37.430 --> 07:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
mysterious virus came into being among
 
07:52:39.670 --> 07:52:39.680 align:start position:0%
those documents was a significant report
 
07:52:42.548 --> 07:52:42.558 align:start position:0%
by major joseph p murphy who as a darpa
 
07:52:44.708 --> 07:52:44.718 align:start position:0%
fellow was able to collect and analyze
 
07:52:47.030 --> 07:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
documents can mean conveniently hidden
 
07:52:49.110 --> 07:52:49.120 align:start position:0%
from site his analysis noted the
 
07:52:51.110 --> 07:52:51.120 align:start position:0%
important role of ivermectin in the
 
07:52:54.310 --> 07:52:54.320 align:start position:0%
treatment of covid19
 
07:52:56.150 --> 07:52:56.160 align:start position:0%
now that was all about you can actually
 
07:52:58.150 --> 07:52:58.160 align:start position:0%
read the echo health
 
07:53:01.190 --> 07:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
alliance proposal that darpa rejected
 
07:53:03.830 --> 07:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
because it involved gain of function
 
07:53:05.830 --> 07:53:05.840 align:start position:0%
it involved not looking at any of the
 
07:53:08.310 --> 07:53:08.320 align:start position:0%
ethical type of things involved
 
07:53:10.388 --> 07:53:10.398 align:start position:0%
there was a whole host of things that it
 
07:53:12.788 --> 07:53:12.798 align:start position:0%
did not do that darpa said no
 
07:53:14.150 --> 07:53:14.160 align:start position:0%
but tony
 
07:53:15.708 --> 07:53:15.718 align:start position:0%
uh fauci
 
07:53:19.030 --> 07:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
niaid in the nih approved it and went
 
07:53:20.788 --> 07:53:20.798 align:start position:0%
forward with it you can read the entire
 
07:53:22.788 --> 07:53:22.798 align:start position:0%
thing so you know what's going on
 
07:53:24.788 --> 07:53:24.798 align:start position:0%
anyway you and
 
07:53:26.708 --> 07:53:26.718 align:start position:0%
the virus actually was a vaccine
 
07:53:29.750 --> 07:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
produced for bats that was the intention
 
07:53:32.310 --> 07:53:32.320 align:start position:0%
it was aerolocized on purpose so that
 
07:53:35.350 --> 07:53:35.360 align:start position:0%
they could spray it into bat caves
 
07:53:37.190 --> 07:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
anyway here is
 
07:53:38.948 --> 07:53:38.958 align:start position:0%
what um
 
07:53:41.670 --> 07:53:41.680 align:start position:0%
major murphy had ma had to say
 
07:53:44.548 --> 07:53:44.558 align:start position:0%
the team meaning the the proposal the
 
07:53:47.990 --> 07:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
alliance the team selected sarsar kovis
 
07:53:51.350 --> 07:53:51.360 align:start position:0%
that were most monoclonal antibody and
 
07:53:54.628 --> 07:53:54.638 align:start position:0%
vaccine resistant
 
07:53:56.628 --> 07:53:56.638 align:start position:0%
it is not practical to inoculate bats
 
07:53:58.708 --> 07:53:58.718 align:start position:0%
directly with shots nor can bats get
 
07:54:00.468 --> 07:54:00.478 align:start position:0%
respiratory infections from droplets so
 
07:54:02.708 --> 07:54:02.718 align:start position:0%
the team developed an aerosol to deliver
 
07:54:04.468 --> 07:54:04.478 align:start position:0%
the inoculations directly to the caves
 
07:54:06.548 --> 07:54:06.558 align:start position:0%
to ensure it worked well they developed
 
07:54:08.868 --> 07:54:08.878 align:start position:0%
the aerosol against
 
07:54:11.670 --> 07:54:11.680 align:start position:0%
masks civets
 
07:54:13.110 --> 07:54:13.120 align:start position:0%
the proposal
 
07:54:17.030 --> 07:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
notes that interferon rem desevere and
 
07:54:19.910 --> 07:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
chloroquine phosphate inhibits sars cov
 
07:54:22.948 --> 07:54:22.958 align:start position:0%
viral replication so the proposal by
 
07:54:25.430 --> 07:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
echo health noted that those things are
 
07:54:28.230 --> 07:54:28.240 align:start position:0%
effective 30 seconds because it is now
 
07:54:28.240 --> 07:54:29.350 align:start position:0%
effective 30 seconds because it is now
known

07:54:29.350 --> 07:54:29.360 align:start position:0%
known
 
07:54:29.360 --> 07:54:30.468 align:start position:0%
known
nature

07:54:30.468 --> 07:54:30.478 align:start position:0%
nature
 
07:54:32.868 --> 07:54:32.878 align:start position:0%
that the sars-kobe's illness is readily
 
07:54:34.548 --> 07:54:34.558 align:start position:0%
resolved with early treatments that
 
07:54:36.150 --> 07:54:36.160 align:start position:0%
inhibit the viral replication that
 
07:54:37.990 --> 07:54:38.000 align:start position:0%
spreads the spike proteins around the
 
07:54:40.468 --> 07:54:40.478 align:start position:0%
body which induce a harmful overactive
 
07:54:42.548 --> 07:54:42.558 align:start position:0%
immune response as the body tries to
 
07:54:45.750 --> 07:54:45.760 align:start position:0%
clear the spikes from the ac2 receptors
 
07:54:47.910 --> 07:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
many of the early treatment protocols
 
07:54:50.388 --> 07:54:50.398 align:start position:0%
ignored by the authorities work because
 
07:54:52.468 --> 07:54:52.478 align:start position:0%
they inhibit viral replication
 
07:54:54.628 --> 07:54:54.638 align:start position:0%
or modulate the immune response to the
 
07:54:57.110 --> 07:54:57.120 align:start position:0%
spike proteins which makes sense within
 
07:54:59.110 --> 07:54:59.120 align:start position:0%
the context of what echo health was
 
07:55:01.030 --> 07:55:01.040 align:start position:0%
creating thank you so much for your
 
07:55:03.430 --> 07:55:03.440 align:start position:0%
testimony i really appreciate it we now
 
07:55:11.270 --> 07:55:11.280 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chairman thank you all the
 
07:55:14.548 --> 07:55:14.558 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
 
07:55:15.990 --> 07:55:16.000 align:start position:0%
i'm here representing myself and my
 
07:55:17.750 --> 07:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
husband we live up in the lakes region i
 
07:55:19.750 --> 07:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
also have been a
 
07:55:21.830 --> 07:55:21.840 align:start position:0%
consultant with pharmaceutical companies
 
07:55:23.830 --> 07:55:23.840 align:start position:0%
and with calling on hematologists and
 
07:55:25.830 --> 07:55:25.840 align:start position:0%
oncologists for 18 years
 
07:55:28.788 --> 07:55:28.798 align:start position:0%
so as far as this potential
 
07:55:30.788 --> 07:55:30.798 align:start position:0%
bill being put forward i support it i
 
07:55:33.270 --> 07:55:33.280 align:start position:0%
think it's very important for
 
07:55:35.190 --> 07:55:35.200 align:start position:0%
i would say one website that you could
 
07:55:36.910 --> 07:55:36.920 align:start position:0%
go to is
 
07:55:39.670 --> 07:55:39.680 align:start position:0%
covid.daystar.com that has multiple
 
07:55:42.150 --> 07:55:42.160 align:start position:0%
interviews with multiple experts
 
07:55:44.468 --> 07:55:44.478 align:start position:0%
including including peter mccullough
 
07:55:44.478 --> 07:55:45.350 align:start position:0%
including including peter mccullough
and

07:55:45.350 --> 07:55:45.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:55:46.788 --> 07:55:46.798 align:start position:0%
you know the gentleman from district 3
 
07:55:48.388 --> 07:55:48.398 align:start position:0%
talked about conflict of interest and
 
07:55:51.270 --> 07:55:51.280 align:start position:0%
you know i feel for for um i thank you
 
07:55:53.190 --> 07:55:53.200 align:start position:0%
all for your service and i know everyone
 
07:55:54.628 --> 07:55:54.638 align:start position:0%
is wanting to do the right thing whether
 
07:55:56.948 --> 07:55:56.958 align:start position:0%
you're a pharmacist or a physician
 
07:55:59.270 --> 07:55:59.280 align:start position:0%
but i think we really need the truth is
 
07:56:01.190 --> 07:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
what sets us free right we live with the
 
07:56:03.350 --> 07:56:03.360 align:start position:0%
model here live free or die and that's
 
07:56:05.510 --> 07:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
all i can hope is that truth comes to
 
07:56:07.030 --> 07:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
the surface
 
07:56:09.270 --> 07:56:09.280 align:start position:0%
dr fauci actually has royalties and
 
07:56:11.350 --> 07:56:11.360 align:start position:0%
investments with the moderna patent so
 
07:56:13.030 --> 07:56:13.040 align:start position:0%
when you talk about conflict of interest
 
07:56:15.110 --> 07:56:15.120 align:start position:0%
for rem desevier to be the protocol and
 
07:56:17.110 --> 07:56:17.120 align:start position:0%
for physicians to be penalized for
 
07:56:19.350 --> 07:56:19.360 align:start position:0%
writing a prescription for a medication
 
07:56:21.750 --> 07:56:21.760 align:start position:0%
that could potentially help patients
 
07:56:25.190 --> 07:56:25.200 align:start position:0%
beat this for early treatment it's just
 
07:56:27.430 --> 07:56:27.440 align:start position:0%
it's mind-blowing to me what's happening
 
07:56:28.868 --> 07:56:28.878 align:start position:0%
in our country
 
07:56:30.628 --> 07:56:30.638 align:start position:0%
and we don't want any of our family or
 
07:56:32.868 --> 07:56:32.878 align:start position:0%
friends to pass from this disease but we
 
07:56:34.150 --> 07:56:34.160 align:start position:0%
also want to make sure that we help them
 
07:56:36.708 --> 07:56:36.718 align:start position:0%
get the protocols that are necessary
 
07:56:38.548 --> 07:56:38.558 align:start position:0%
for them to not face this disgusting
 
07:56:42.150 --> 07:56:42.160 align:start position:0%
disease so i'm in support of this bill
 
07:56:44.070 --> 07:56:44.080 align:start position:0%

southwest college of naturopathic

medicine where i was trained to provide
 
07:57:54.548 --> 07:57:54.558 align:start position:0%
integrative primary care
 
07:57:56.948 --> 07:57:56.958 align:start position:0%
which is within the scope in arizona in
 
07:57:58.150 --> 07:57:58.160 align:start position:0%
new hampshire we're considered
 
07:57:58.160 --> 07:57:59.350 align:start position:0%
new hampshire we're considered
specialists

07:57:59.350 --> 07:57:59.360 align:start position:0%
specialists
 
07:58:00.948 --> 07:58:00.958 align:start position:0%
i'm a program director for two
 
07:58:02.708 --> 07:58:02.718 align:start position:0%
accredited postgraduate resident
 
07:58:04.628 --> 07:58:04.638 align:start position:0%
training programs from within my private
 
07:58:07.030 --> 07:58:07.040 align:start position:0%
medical practice and our group practice
 
07:58:09.830 --> 07:58:09.840 align:start position:0%
has four nds a nurse practitioner and
 
07:58:12.948 --> 07:58:12.958 align:start position:0%
two registered nurses um our approach is
 
07:58:15.030 --> 07:58:15.040 align:start position:0%
always to treat things naturally and as
 
07:58:18.230 --> 07:58:18.240 align:start position:0%
safely as possible and um
 
07:58:20.868 --> 07:58:20.878 align:start position:0%
when covet happened
 
07:58:23.030 --> 07:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
my patients turned to me
 
07:58:23.040 --> 07:58:24.150 align:start position:0%
my patients turned to me
um

07:58:24.150 --> 07:58:24.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:58:26.548 --> 07:58:26.558 align:start position:0%
to to look for some other solution
 
07:58:29.030 --> 07:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
because the cdc's
 
07:58:31.510 --> 07:58:31.520 align:start position:0%
website titled what to do if you get
 
07:58:33.990 --> 07:58:34.000 align:start position:0%
sick offers the following home treatment
 
07:58:35.990 --> 07:58:36.000 align:start position:0%
protocol recommendations
 
07:58:39.190 --> 07:58:39.200 align:start position:0%
quarantine rest hydrate take
 
07:58:41.270 --> 07:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
acetaminophen as needed and call a
 
07:58:42.948 --> 07:58:42.958 align:start position:0%
doctor if you have trouble breathing
 
07:58:44.628 --> 07:58:44.638 align:start position:0%
that's it
 
07:58:48.468 --> 07:58:48.478 align:start position:0%
when the pandemic hit my patients
 
07:58:51.910 --> 07:58:51.920 align:start position:0%
drove me to begin researching heavily
 
07:58:54.388 --> 07:58:54.398 align:start position:0%
and i wanted to understand not just
 
07:58:54.398 --> 07:58:55.510 align:start position:0%
and i wanted to understand not just
um

07:58:55.510 --> 07:58:55.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:58:57.270 --> 07:58:57.280 align:start position:0%
medications and supplements that might
 
07:58:58.948 --> 07:58:58.958 align:start position:0%
work on prior
 
07:59:02.948 --> 07:59:02.958 align:start position:0%
viruses similar to this but also um
 
07:59:06.070 --> 07:59:06.080 align:start position:0%
how the virus worked the pathology and
 
07:59:08.150 --> 07:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
um without getting into any more i do
 
07:59:09.830 --> 07:59:09.840 align:start position:0%
believe in ivermectin i'll leave it at
 
07:59:11.350 --> 07:59:11.360 align:start position:0%
that okay
 
07:59:13.270 --> 07:59:13.280 align:start position:0%
this conversation has been very
 
07:59:15.590 --> 07:59:15.600 align:start position:0%
enlightening i really have enjoyed being
 
07:59:17.510 --> 07:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
here and hearing both sides
 
07:59:19.990 --> 07:59:20.000 align:start position:0%
i don't think it comes down to a debate
 
07:59:21.590 --> 07:59:21.600 align:start position:0%
about like
 
07:59:23.190 --> 07:59:23.200 align:start position:0%
whether we're going to get this fda
 
07:59:25.670 --> 07:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
approved right now right i think that
 
07:59:28.548 --> 07:59:28.558 align:start position:0%
what we have to look at is is it safe
 
07:59:30.788 --> 07:59:30.798 align:start position:0%
it sounds like it's going to be safe as
 
07:59:33.670 --> 07:59:33.680 align:start position:0%
long as um
 
07:59:36.708 --> 07:59:36.718 align:start position:0%
sorry distracted it will be safe i've
 
07:59:36.718 --> 07:59:37.510 align:start position:0%
sorry distracted it will be safe i've
heard

07:59:37.510 --> 07:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
heard
 
07:59:40.230 --> 07:59:40.240 align:start position:0%
um as long as there's absolutely
 
07:59:40.240 --> 07:59:41.270 align:start position:0%
um as long as there's absolutely
um

07:59:41.270 --> 07:59:41.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:59:42.628 --> 07:59:42.638 align:start position:0%
as long as we can't show that there's
 
07:59:44.468 --> 07:59:44.478 align:start position:0%
absolutely no benefit that's what i
 
07:59:45.670 --> 07:59:45.680 align:start position:0%
heard today
 
07:59:48.150 --> 07:59:48.160 align:start position:0%
if i was clear it's safe as long as we
 
07:59:50.628 --> 07:59:50.638 align:start position:0%
can show that there's
 
07:59:54.150 --> 07:59:54.160 align:start position:0%
no risk no harm no harm
 
07:59:54.160 --> 07:59:55.590 align:start position:0%
no risk no harm no harm
um

07:59:55.590 --> 07:59:55.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:59:57.350 --> 07:59:57.360 align:start position:0%
we've all been here for six hours on low
 
07:59:58.948 --> 07:59:58.958 align:start position:0%
blood sugar right now
 
08:00:00.388 --> 08:00:00.398 align:start position:0%
um so
 
08:00:02.310 --> 08:00:02.320 align:start position:0%
if if
 
08:00:03.510 --> 08:00:03.520 align:start position:0%
the research
 
08:00:06.310 --> 08:00:06.320 align:start position:0%
shows that there's absolutely no benefit
 
08:00:09.190 --> 08:00:09.200 align:start position:0%
then the doctors here aren't in favor
 
08:00:12.150 --> 08:00:12.160 align:start position:0%
of you've got 15 seconds okay of having
 
08:00:12.160 --> 08:00:13.750 align:start position:0%
of you've got 15 seconds okay of having
ivermectin

08:00:13.750 --> 08:00:13.760 align:start position:0%
ivermectin
 
08:00:15.910 --> 08:00:15.920 align:start position:0%
being used in the state here
 
08:00:17.670 --> 08:00:17.680 align:start position:0%
let's just agree now there is some
 
08:00:20.388 --> 08:00:20.398 align:start position:0%
evidence that shows that it it can work
 
08:00:21.750 --> 08:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
to some degree
 
08:00:24.388 --> 08:00:24.398 align:start position:0%
if i'm on my deathbed and you tell me
 
08:00:27.030 --> 08:00:27.040 align:start position:0%
that i can take ivermectin and maybe
 
08:00:28.310 --> 08:00:28.320 align:start position:0%
have a 10
 
08:00:30.468 --> 08:00:30.478 align:start position:0%
chance of living
 
08:00:32.708 --> 08:00:32.718 align:start position:0%
more give it to me
 
08:00:34.388 --> 08:00:34.398 align:start position:0%
i don't have time to wait for a research
 
08:00:36.868 --> 08:00:36.878 align:start position:0%
study to get approved it's safe it's fda
 
08:00:38.310 --> 08:00:38.320 align:start position:0%
approved already
 
08:00:41.430 --> 08:00:41.440 align:start position:0%
this medication that just got approved
 
08:00:42.788 --> 08:00:42.798 align:start position:0%
tax libid
 
08:00:45.670 --> 08:00:45.680 align:start position:0%
530 unless the government pays for it
 
08:00:47.510 --> 08:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
right so okay
 
08:00:50.230 --> 08:00:50.240 align:start position:0%
thank you that's it thank you dr soloway
 
08:00:52.628 --> 08:00:52.638 align:start position:0%

for your patience in being here it's
 
08:00:59.190 --> 08:00:59.200 align:start position:0%
clear that you have ample training and i
 
08:01:00.548 --> 08:01:00.558 align:start position:0%
suspect you have a fair amount of
 
08:01:03.590 --> 08:01:03.600 align:start position:0%
scientific training as well in fact i'm
 
08:01:05.350 --> 08:01:05.360 align:start position:0%
quite positive of that
 
08:01:05.360 --> 08:01:06.230 align:start position:0%
quite positive of that
um

08:01:06.230 --> 08:01:06.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
08:01:07.990 --> 08:01:08.000 align:start position:0%

08:01:10.948 --> 08:01:10.958 align:start position:0%
the recommendations and the data that
 
08:01:14.388 --> 08:01:14.398 align:start position:0%
 
08:01:14.398 --> 08:01:15.270 align:start position:0%

well i
 
08:01:18.628 --> 08:01:18.638 align:start position:0%
i think that there is a
 
08:01:20.310 --> 08:01:20.320 align:start position:0%
uh there's a large group of doctors
 
08:01:21.990 --> 08:01:22.000 align:start position:0%
right now that have written to the fda
 
08:01:23.510 --> 08:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
and ask them to clarify if they've
 
08:01:25.830 --> 08:01:25.840 align:start position:0%
actually looked at all the research
 
08:01:28.468 --> 08:01:28.478 align:start position:0%
and how well they've analyzed it so i
 
08:01:30.788 --> 08:01:30.798 align:start position:0%
don't feel confident that
 
08:01:31.830 --> 08:01:31.840 align:start position:0%
they have
 
08:01:34.388 --> 08:01:34.398 align:start position:0%
they can prove that there's no benefit
 
08:01:34.398 --> 08:01:35.430 align:start position:0%
they can prove that there's no benefit
