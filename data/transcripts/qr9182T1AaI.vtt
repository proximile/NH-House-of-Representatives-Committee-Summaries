00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um so my name is
 
00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:42.280 align:start position:0%
Davis Allen I'll be the researcher for
 
00:07:45.149 --> 00:07:45.159 align:start position:0%
this committee um I serve uh the
 
00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:48.280 align:start position:0%
entirety of the committee um in my work
 
00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:50.280 align:start position:0%
I'll be performing any sort of research
 
00:07:52.629 --> 00:07:52.639 align:start position:0%
questions uh my understanding right now
 
00:07:54.589 --> 00:07:54.599 align:start position:0%
of the position is that any questions
 
00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:55.960 align:start position:0%
from the rank and file members of the
 
00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
committee will go through the chair and
 
00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
then on to me uh
 
00:08:02.309 --> 00:08:02.319 align:start position:0%
I'll get confirmation on that from my
 
00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:04.400 align:start position:0%
leadership just to ensure and then I'll
 
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
report back to the chair on that um but
 
00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:09.280 align:start position:0%
I believe that's to make sure there's no
 
00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:12.080 align:start position:0%
duplicate requests um no requests that
 
00:08:13.909 --> 00:08:13.919 align:start position:0%
would be partisan in one way or another
 
00:08:16.629 --> 00:08:16.639 align:start position:0%
as my position is nonpartisan I serve
 
00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:18.720 align:start position:0%
everybody in the committee um in a
 
00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:21.080 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan way um so if there's
 
00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:23.840 align:start position:0%
questions about what current statutes
 
00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:26.120 align:start position:0%
exist if there's questions about what
 
00:08:28.029 --> 00:08:28.039 align:start position:0%
federal rules and regulations there are
 
00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
if there would be conflicts that if
 
00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
there are questions about a legislative
 
00:08:33.949 --> 00:08:33.959 align:start position:0%
history of how many times has this bill
 
00:08:37.509 --> 00:08:37.519 align:start position:0%
or this topic come up before Etc um
 
00:08:39.029 --> 00:08:39.039 align:start position:0%
those are some of the things that I
 
00:08:40.589 --> 00:08:40.599 align:start position:0%
would be able to assist this committee
 
00:08:43.389 --> 00:08:43.399 align:start position:0%
with uh regarding research and Reporting
 
00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:44.920 align:start position:0%

are important issues to my district just
 
00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:06.720 align:start position:0%

thank you um so my name is Christine
 
00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
cybert I am from
 
00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
Manchester um Ward one Manchester and um
 
00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:31.240 align:start position:0%
I'm excited to be here in this ranking
 
00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:34.280 align:start position:0%
position it's a little new to me but uh
 
00:20:36.789 --> 00:20:36.799 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to start with what I said
 
00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:40.520 align:start position:0%
the last time we came here um is that
 
00:20:43.149 --> 00:20:43.159 align:start position:0%
you know I think we all have family in
 
00:20:46.149 --> 00:20:46.159 align:start position:0%
the military I do my husband was in the
 
00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:49.720 align:start position:0%
Navy he was on in masawa stationed there
 
00:20:53.549 --> 00:20:53.559 align:start position:0%
from 2004 to or 2000 to
 
00:20:56.909 --> 00:20:56.919 align:start position:0%
2005 um and he actually worked in
 
00:20:59.110 --> 00:20:59.120 align:start position:0%
intelligence there so I don't
 
00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:01.360 align:start position:0%
technically know what he did he'd have
 
00:21:06.549 --> 00:21:06.559 align:start position:0%
to kill me right um but yeah so I think
 
00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:09.480 align:start position:0%
we can agree that despite you know the
 
00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
reasons we get into conflicts all of
 
00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:15.080 align:start position:0%
that we might totally disagree on that
 
00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:17.200 align:start position:0%
um we really owe it to our veterans to
 
00:21:19.789 --> 00:21:19.799 align:start position:0%
take care of them um you know I've
 
00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:21.440 align:start position:0%
recently been looking up a lot of
 
00:21:23.549 --> 00:21:23.559 align:start position:0%
research on my family because a
 
00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:26.120 align:start position:0%
constituent was talking me into joining
 
00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:26.990 align:start position:0%
constituent was talking me into joining
the

00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
DAR and you know I'm finding that I have
 
00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
upbs of that qualify about you know
 
00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:36.480 align:start position:0%

00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
right now of people who fought in the
 
00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:41.000 align:start position:0%
Revolutionary War and I believe their
 
00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
service is really important and it's
 
00:21:46.029 --> 00:21:46.039 align:start position:0%

00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
that and again to this day I appreciate
 
00:21:50.909 --> 00:21:50.919 align:start position:0%
every veteran that is in this room for
 
00:21:55.789 --> 00:21:55.799 align:start position:0%

the al-Qaeda in in Afghanistan uh those
 
00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
experiences have uh taught me to pay a
 
00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
lot better attention to US foreign
 
00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:22.360 align:start position:0%
policy and it has crafted my uh
 
00:25:24.909 --> 00:25:24.919 align:start position:0%
political leaning
 
00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:27.640 align:start position:0%
sense thank you repr representative

00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:35.960 align:start position:0%
you mentioned 99 and the ASVAB uh ASVAB
 
00:25:37.990 --> 00:25:38.000 align:start position:0%

vocational aptitude battery uh some kids

take it getting out of school and 99
 
00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:46.200 align:start position:0%
means that was in the top
 
00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:49.520 align:start position:0%
1% so rep may or may not be a genius but
 
00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:52.520 align:start position:0%

you thank you represent buak and for
 
00:28:39.710 --> 00:28:39.720 align:start position:0%
anyone watching online who maybe doesn't
 
00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
know where Bhutan is if you could uh
 
00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:45.720 align:start position:0%
just give them uh a sense of
 
00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:48.760 align:start position:0%
geographically where that is so uh it's
 
00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
in in between uh India and China or
 
00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:54.720 align:start position:0%
Tibet it's a very tiny country uh it's
 
00:28:58.149 --> 00:28:58.159 align:start position:0%
in Southeast Asian country
 
00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:00.120 align:start position:0%
what it has is gross national happiness
 
00:29:02.149 --> 00:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
which we don't have it so they measure
 
00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:04.480 align:start position:0%
the development through uh gross
 
00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:07.000 align:start position:0%
national happiness not gross domestic
 
00:29:10.909 --> 00:29:10.919 align:start position:0%
product okay and um it's m mountainous
 
00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:13.360 align:start position:0%
is that correct so if if representative
 
00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:15.200 align:start position:0%
Lloyd's looking from mountains uh she
 
00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
could find them in Bhutan that's fair to
 
00:29:20.389 --> 00:29:20.399 align:start position:0%
say thank you welcome glad that you're

for a little bit discovered that
 
00:30:17.389 --> 00:30:17.399 align:start position:0%
Philly's not as good as New Hampshire so
 
00:30:20.990 --> 00:30:21.000 align:start position:0%
I moved back uh in my day job I work in

housing advocacy and anti-h housing
 
00:30:25.509 --> 00:30:25.519 align:start position:0%
discrimination advocacy so since there's
 
00:30:28.830 --> 00:30:28.840 align:start position:0%
such a high rate of homeless and housing
 
00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:31.200 align:start position:0%
and stability for veterans and just
 
00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:34.440 align:start position:0%
discrimination against veterans uh based
 
00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:37.320 align:start position:0%
on various you know disabilities things
 
00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:38.600 align:start position:0%
that people may have gotten in the
 
00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:40.720 align:start position:0%
service I'm really looking forward to
 
00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:42.840 align:start position:0%
being able to use that experience in
 
00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:44.760 align:start position:0%
housing to make an
 
00:30:47.870 --> 00:30:47.880 align:start position:0%
impact thank you repent Foss okay that

00:31:56.789 --> 00:31:56.799 align:start position:0%
so a quick background of myself I sort
 
00:31:59.269 --> 00:31:59.279 align:start position:0%
of chule maam F and representative
 
00:32:01.470 --> 00:32:01.480 align:start position:0%
Manion um I actually grew up in
 
00:32:03.629 --> 00:32:03.639 align:start position:0%
Manchester uh manchest Memorial High
 
00:32:06.269 --> 00:32:06.279 align:start position:0%
School a proud graduate uh was very
 
00:32:07.470 --> 00:32:07.480 align:start position:0%
fortunate to go to United States
 
00:32:09.870 --> 00:32:09.880 align:start position:0%
Military Academy at West Point was
 
00:32:12.190 --> 00:32:12.200 align:start position:0%
branched infantry served on active duty
 
00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
I chuckle because uh I did so poorly in
 
00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
mechanical engineering that I was
 
00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:17.080 align:start position:0%
branched into the Infantry for about
 
00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:19.480 align:start position:0%
five six years on active duty uh after
 
00:32:21.669 --> 00:32:21.679 align:start position:0%
that time I uh uh transitioned to the
 
00:32:23.230 --> 00:32:23.240 align:start position:0%
National Garden reserves I became a
 
00:32:25.470 --> 00:32:25.480 align:start position:0%
Green Beret from Special Forces and I
 
00:32:26.629 --> 00:32:26.639 align:start position:0%
joined the New Hampshire National Garden
 
00:32:29.549 --> 00:32:29.559 align:start position:0%
in 2007 uh lifelong New Hampshire
 
00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
resident other than on active duty and
 
00:32:33.509 --> 00:32:33.519 align:start position:0%
deployed uh three deployments Iraq and
 
00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
Afghanistan I currently reside in
 
00:32:37.870 --> 00:32:37.880 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth enough of
 
00:32:40.909 --> 00:32:40.919 align:start position:0%
that so I handed out some um information
 
00:32:43.110 --> 00:32:43.120 align:start position:0%
packets when you open it up generally
 
00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:44.760 align:start position:0%
speaking the leftand side is about the
 
00:32:46.750 --> 00:32:46.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire National Guard the right
 
00:32:48.750 --> 00:32:48.760 align:start position:0%
hand side is really about uh Department
 
00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:51.480 align:start position:0%
of military Affairs and veteran services
 
00:32:53.710 --> 00:32:53.720 align:start position:0%
so let's just talk through a few things
 
00:32:56.230 --> 00:32:56.240 align:start position:0%
for those new Representatives here take
 
00:32:59.029 --> 00:32:59.039 align:start position:0%
this as sort of national guard
 
00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
101 Ur New Hampshire National Guard is
 
00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
approximately 3,000 people there's
 
00:33:06.269 --> 00:33:06.279 align:start position:0%
almost 2,800 Uniform service members in
 
00:33:08.269 --> 00:33:08.279 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire just in the
 
00:33:10.149 --> 00:33:10.159 align:start position:0%
guard that has that has nothing to do
 
00:33:12.549 --> 00:33:12.559 align:start position:0%
with the Army Reserves an active duty
 
00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
Air Force squadron at peas generally
 
00:33:16.029 --> 00:33:16.039 align:start position:0%
speaking your New Hampshire National
 
00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:18.720 align:start position:0%
Guard is approximately 3,000 strong when
 
00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
you break it down for the Army and air
 
00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:22.440 align:start position:0%
the Air National Guards approximately
 
00:33:24.269 --> 00:33:24.279 align:start position:0%
1100 and I'm just giving you round
 
00:33:27.870 --> 00:33:27.880 align:start position:0%
numbers to just keep it simple um 1,00
 
00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
Airman at paser National Guard base it's
 
00:33:31.590 --> 00:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
the only place you'll find an air
 
00:33:35.389 --> 00:33:35.399 align:start position:0%
National Guards person um we fly the KC
 
00:33:39.029 --> 00:33:39.039 align:start position:0%
46 refueler which is is the most modern
 
00:33:42.389 --> 00:33:42.399 align:start position:0%
refueler of 18 Air National Guard Wings
 
00:33:45.389 --> 00:33:45.399 align:start position:0%
in the country we are the only one with
 
00:33:48.669 --> 00:33:48.679 align:start position:0%
a KC 46 refueler what does that mean
 
00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:51.760 align:start position:0%
strategic relevance 17 other states have
 
00:33:54.190 --> 00:33:54.200 align:start position:0%
was called the KC 135 which is which is
 
00:33:56.789 --> 00:33:56.799 align:start position:0%
an Eisenhower a refueler we have
 
00:33:58.590 --> 00:33:58.600 align:start position:0%
strategic relevance and guess what we
 
00:34:00.629 --> 00:34:00.639 align:start position:0%
have about 150 Airmen deployed right now
 
00:34:02.629 --> 00:34:02.639 align:start position:0%
to the Middle East they're on a 90-day
 
00:34:04.190 --> 00:34:04.200 align:start position:0%
deployment and they'll be coming back uh
 
00:34:05.470 --> 00:34:05.480 align:start position:0%
early next
 
00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
month we also because of the geographic
 
00:34:10.589 --> 00:34:10.599 align:start position:0%
location of the training flights uh the
 
00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
sorties that go overseas we also have
 
00:34:16.109 --> 00:34:16.119 align:start position:0%
150 active duty Airmen a complete it's
 
00:34:18.669 --> 00:34:18.679 align:start position:0%
called the 64th air refilling Squadron
 
00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:21.240 align:start position:0%
also stationed at P's so we can get the
 
00:34:22.829 --> 00:34:22.839 align:start position:0%
maximum amount out of that airplane to
 
00:34:24.510 --> 00:34:24.520 align:start position:0%
support Global combatants around the
 
00:34:26.669 --> 00:34:26.679 align:start position:0%
globe so it's a big deal we have
 
00:34:28.270 --> 00:34:28.280 align:start position:0%
strategic relevance that we're the only
 
00:34:29.790 --> 00:34:29.800 align:start position:0%
Air National Guard Wing in the country
 
00:34:30.829 --> 00:34:30.839 align:start position:0%
with this
 
00:34:33.990 --> 00:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
plane let's transition to the Army guard
 
00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
the Army guard generally speaking is
 
00:34:38.669 --> 00:34:38.679 align:start position:0%
about 1800 strong you will generally see
 
00:34:40.349 --> 00:34:40.359 align:start position:0%
as you open up that brochure there's a
 
00:34:41.790 --> 00:34:41.800 align:start position:0%
trifold and it'll give you the
 
00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:43.919 align:start position:0%
geographic location of all our
 
00:34:45.470 --> 00:34:45.480 align:start position:0%
facilities when you look at that
 
00:34:47.829 --> 00:34:47.839 align:start position:0%
facilities just conceptually think of
 
00:34:52.270 --> 00:34:52.280 align:start position:0%
this 1,800 soldiers 18 armories in 18
 
00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:54.560 align:start position:0%
different communities so generally
 
00:34:56.510 --> 00:34:56.520 align:start position:0%
speaking a week and a month you have 100
 
00:34:58.349 --> 00:34:58.359 align:start position:0%
soldiers right
 
00:34:59.470 --> 00:34:59.480 align:start position:0%
when you might go buy one of our
 
00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:01.320 align:start position:0%
armories the challenge for us is there's
 
00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:03.200 align:start position:0%
only three to four full timers so
 
00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:04.640 align:start position:0%
generally a lot of our facilities look
 
00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
empty but on that week and a month 97
 
00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:09.720 align:start position:0%
other soldiers show up there's very
 
00:35:12.109 --> 00:35:12.119 align:start position:0%
simple broad terms the Manchester Army
 
00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
has significantly more people we have
 
00:35:16.109 --> 00:35:16.119 align:start position:0%
about 250 soldiers in there but
 
00:35:17.310 --> 00:35:17.320 align:start position:0%
generally speaking when you're out in
 
00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:19.560 align:start position:0%
your communities and you see an Armory
 
00:35:20.790 --> 00:35:20.800 align:start position:0%
there's three to four
 
00:35:22.829 --> 00:35:22.839 align:start position:0%
full-timers and a week and a month an
 
00:35:25.349 --> 00:35:25.359 align:start position:0%
extra 75 to 100 soldiers will show
 
00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
up so there there number reason people
 
00:35:28.950 --> 00:35:28.960 align:start position:0%
join the military of the New Hampshire
 
00:35:30.990 --> 00:35:31.000 align:start position:0%
National Guard um a sense of purpose to
 
00:35:33.310 --> 00:35:33.320 align:start position:0%
serve their Nation right when I talk to
 
00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:34.640 align:start position:0%
our recruiters and when I talk to our
 
00:35:36.430 --> 00:35:36.440 align:start position:0%
Junior soldiers who come in and we bring
 
00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:38.960 align:start position:0%
them on sort of like an hro 101 the
 
00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:40.400 align:start position:0%
number one reason they continue to join
 
00:35:42.069 --> 00:35:42.079 align:start position:0%
is for a sense of service or purpose of
 
00:35:44.109 --> 00:35:44.119 align:start position:0%
their Nation number two reason is
 
00:35:46.510 --> 00:35:46.520 align:start position:0%
generally the education benefits the
 
00:35:48.270 --> 00:35:48.280 align:start position:0%
biggest benefit the the state gives to
 
00:35:50.069 --> 00:35:50.079 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire National Guard is free
 
00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:52.960 align:start position:0%
tuition at the University system of New
 
00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:55.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as someone once described to
 
00:35:57.109 --> 00:35:57.119 align:start position:0%
me were the educator uh were the
 
00:35:59.470 --> 00:35:59.480 align:start position:0%
escalator to the middle class we are all
 
00:36:01.230 --> 00:36:01.240 align:start position:0%
about educational opportunities whether
 
00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
it's white collar or blue collar it does
 
00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
not matter the biggest benefit the state
 
00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
uh of New Hampshire this legislative
 
00:36:10.510 --> 00:36:10.520 align:start position:0%
body RIT large gives to us is that free
 
00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:12.280 align:start position:0%
tuition waiver either through the
 
00:36:14.309 --> 00:36:14.319 align:start position:0%
university system of New Hampshire with
 
00:36:16.349 --> 00:36:16.359 align:start position:0%
the community college system of New
 
00:36:19.109 --> 00:36:19.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire there's other benefits as well
 
00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:20.640 align:start position:0%
but generally speaking what we tell our
 
00:36:22.670 --> 00:36:22.680 align:start position:0%
soldiers and Airmen is um you know you
 
00:36:24.349 --> 00:36:24.359 align:start position:0%
got to be a good citizen right it's all
 
00:36:26.750 --> 00:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
about education you know and trying to
 
00:36:29.150 --> 00:36:29.160 align:start position:0%
get those younger soldiers in or Airmen
 
00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
into the job market for New Hampshire
 
00:36:34.190 --> 00:36:34.200 align:start position:0%
we're a very young Force approximately
 
00:36:37.109 --> 00:36:37.119 align:start position:0%
20% of our Force are college students so
 
00:36:38.670 --> 00:36:38.680 align:start position:0%
a lot of them at P their National Guard
 
00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
base will go to UNH get your degree Serv
 
00:36:44.390 --> 00:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
in the guard free tuition waiver so
 
00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
that's the number one and two reasons so
 
00:36:48.230 --> 00:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
when you go back to the left-and side
 
00:36:50.550 --> 00:36:50.560 align:start position:0%
you'll also see sort of like a small uh
 
00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:52.680 align:start position:0%
piece of paper and it list our
 
00:36:54.270 --> 00:36:54.280 align:start position:0%
accomplishments so what has the New
 
00:36:55.710 --> 00:36:55.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire National Guard been up to both
 
00:36:57.829 --> 00:36:57.839 align:start position:0%
Army and air once I is the
 
00:36:59.790 --> 00:36:59.800 align:start position:0%
accomplishments of the Guard one side is
 
00:37:01.430 --> 00:37:01.440 align:start position:0%
the accomplish the accomplishments of
 
00:37:02.750 --> 00:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
the Department of military Affairs and
 
00:37:05.109 --> 00:37:05.119 align:start position:0%
veteran services so generally speaking
 
00:37:07.150 --> 00:37:07.160 align:start position:0%
what are the National Guard do last year
 
00:37:08.790 --> 00:37:08.800 align:start position:0%
your number one Mission as an
 
00:37:11.230 --> 00:37:11.240 align:start position:0%
operational force is to fight America's
 
00:37:14.109 --> 00:37:14.119 align:start position:0%
Wars we welcomed home approximately 280
 
00:37:16.270 --> 00:37:16.280 align:start position:0%
soldiers from our field artillery uh
 
00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:18.720 align:start position:0%
Battalion um from the Middle
 
00:37:22.589 --> 00:37:22.599 align:start position:0%
East we activated uh 15 soldiers in
 
00:37:24.589 --> 00:37:24.599 align:start position:0%
support of the governor to go to the
 
00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:26.640 align:start position:0%
Southwest border for 60 days on a state
 
00:37:28.109 --> 00:37:28.119 align:start position:0%
active duty mission in support of
 
00:37:30.990 --> 00:37:31.000 align:start position:0%
operation Lone Star we also sent five
 
00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
soldiers to Florida to support them
 
00:37:36.150 --> 00:37:36.160 align:start position:0%
during Hurricane Milton and we also
 
00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
supported Vermont during a recent
 
00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
flooding event last year with two
 
00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
blackha helicopters provide search and
 
00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
rescue opportunities or um you know U um
 
00:37:46.390 --> 00:37:46.400 align:start position:0%
capabilities to
 
00:37:48.670 --> 00:37:48.680 align:start position:0%
them distilled into this state in New
 
00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire U we did eight search and
 
00:37:53.829 --> 00:37:53.839 align:start position:0%
rescue operations last year and you say
 
00:37:55.990 --> 00:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
okay what did we do for our communities
 
00:37:58.790 --> 00:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
you know we were aggressive and pursued
 
00:38:01.230 --> 00:38:01.240 align:start position:0%
this program called star base the
 
00:38:03.109 --> 00:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
military loves this acronyms we like to
 
00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:04.800 align:start position:0%
confuse both yourselves and ourselves
 
00:38:06.109 --> 00:38:06.119 align:start position:0%
because the Army and a don't speak the
 
00:38:08.470 --> 00:38:08.480 align:start position:0%
same language generally speaking in
 
00:38:10.870 --> 00:38:10.880 align:start position:0%
simple terms is this it's a fifth grade
 
00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:13.720 align:start position:0%
stem program for underprivileged kids we
 
00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
compete amongst the Department of
 
00:38:18.030 --> 00:38:18.040 align:start position:0%
Defense we able to be selected for a a a
 
00:38:20.309 --> 00:38:20.319 align:start position:0%
one of these programs and what it is is
 
00:38:21.950 --> 00:38:21.960 align:start position:0%
the Department of Defense you know sort
 
00:38:24.829 --> 00:38:24.839 align:start position:0%
of grants us money to provide a a
 
00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:28.040 align:start position:0%
dedicated classroom in pem where we've
 
00:38:29.950 --> 00:38:29.960 align:start position:0%
hired two teachers an administrator and
 
00:38:32.390 --> 00:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
an administrative assistant to all they
 
00:38:35.309 --> 00:38:35.319 align:start position:0%
do is teach fifth grade stem um it's a
 
00:38:38.190 --> 00:38:38.200 align:start position:0%
25-hour curriculum to UND uh serve
 
00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:40.720 align:start position:0%
children and so any school within
 
00:38:43.710 --> 00:38:43.720 align:start position:0%
probably like a 30 minute um bus ride
 
00:38:46.790 --> 00:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
from Pam Brook can participate and last
 
00:38:48.470 --> 00:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
year we did the entire Manchester Middle
 
00:38:50.670 --> 00:38:50.680 align:start position:0%
School school district so those are just
 
00:38:52.309 --> 00:38:52.319 align:start position:0%
examples of what we try to do for our
 
00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
community outreach um we also do what's
 
00:38:58.150 --> 00:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
called Innovative Readiness training and
 
00:39:01.589 --> 00:39:01.599 align:start position:0%
what that means is a soldier or Airman
 
00:39:04.109 --> 00:39:04.119 align:start position:0%
does their military
 
00:39:06.430 --> 00:39:06.440 align:start position:0%
job uh in support of our civilian
 
00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:08.640 align:start position:0%
population and so last year what we did
 
00:39:11.309 --> 00:39:11.319 align:start position:0%
was we did three training events where a
 
00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
dental hygienist and our dentist went to
 
00:39:15.750 --> 00:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
Manchester worked out of their Dental
 
00:39:18.510 --> 00:39:18.520 align:start position:0%
van and provided free uh service um for
 
00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:21.200 align:start position:0%
dental cleanings and hyi hygienic uh um
 
00:39:23.790 --> 00:39:23.800 align:start position:0%
for Manchester school children so those
 
00:39:24.750 --> 00:39:24.760 align:start position:0%
are some of the things that the
 
00:39:27.109 --> 00:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire National Guard does let's
 
00:39:28.910 --> 00:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
trans ocean uh transition over to the
 
00:39:30.109 --> 00:39:30.119 align:start position:0%
Department of military Affairs and
 
00:39:32.589 --> 00:39:32.599 align:start position:0%
veteran services I think most of you are
 
00:39:33.870 --> 00:39:33.880 align:start position:0%
aware that in
 
00:39:36.390 --> 00:39:36.400 align:start position:0%
2019 the governor signed an executive
 
00:39:38.950 --> 00:39:38.960 align:start position:0%
order and it was codified into law that
 
00:39:40.430 --> 00:39:40.440 align:start position:0%
established the mil Department of
 
00:39:42.589 --> 00:39:42.599 align:start position:0%
military Affairs and veteran
 
00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:44.960 align:start position:0%
services it was trans uh
 
00:39:46.910 --> 00:39:46.920 align:start position:0%
transformational and what it did was it
 
00:39:48.670 --> 00:39:48.680 align:start position:0%
broke down all these silos and state
 
00:39:50.750 --> 00:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
government and Consolidated all veteran
 
00:39:53.710 --> 00:39:53.720 align:start position:0%
services into one entity so one of the
 
00:39:56.030 --> 00:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
lines I like to say is we're uh we all
 
00:39:57.910 --> 00:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
things veteran except health
 
00:40:00.109 --> 00:40:00.119 align:start position:0%
care Department of military Affairs and
 
00:40:02.349 --> 00:40:02.359 align:start position:0%
veteran services is not the Manchester
 
00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
VA and we are not the Veterans Home in
 
00:40:06.950 --> 00:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
tilted those are separate and distinct
 
00:40:09.750 --> 00:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
entities that we partner and collaborate
 
00:40:12.270 --> 00:40:12.280 align:start position:0%
with but we don't have a part of it but
 
00:40:14.589 --> 00:40:14.599 align:start position:0%
what did it do in 2019 it it it
 
00:40:17.309 --> 00:40:17.319 align:start position:0%
essentially brought in three separate
 
00:40:19.109 --> 00:40:19.119 align:start position:0%
divisions underneath the department of
 
00:40:21.550 --> 00:40:21.560 align:start position:0%
military Affairs and veteran services
 
00:40:22.870 --> 00:40:22.880 align:start position:0%
one as you're all aware of as a state
 
00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
Veteran Cemetery we've always had that
 
00:40:28.910 --> 00:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
um we continue to support that there was
 
00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
a division of veteran services that was
 
00:40:34.309 --> 00:40:34.319 align:start position:0%
on a separate survivors Island um we
 
00:40:36.470 --> 00:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
brought that into the fold there's
 
00:40:38.470 --> 00:40:38.480 align:start position:0%
approximately 10 veteran service
 
00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:40.480 align:start position:0%
officers they're the ones your
 
00:40:42.470 --> 00:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
constituents as a veteran will most
 
00:40:45.430 --> 00:40:45.440 align:start position:0%
likely interact with us for veterans
 
00:40:46.910 --> 00:40:46.920 align:start position:0%
claims and
 
00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
compensation the third branch we brought
 
00:40:50.430 --> 00:40:50.440 align:start position:0%
into it started at Health and Human
 
00:40:51.950 --> 00:40:51.960 align:start position:0%
Services with two employees and we're
 
00:40:54.030 --> 00:40:54.040 align:start position:0%
now up to six and it's our community
 
00:40:55.750 --> 00:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
outreach so we have to have a long
 
00:40:57.630 --> 00:40:57.640 align:start position:0%
acronym and a long term but it's our
 
00:40:59.670 --> 00:40:59.680 align:start position:0%
community outreach we typically call it
 
00:41:02.109 --> 00:41:02.119 align:start position:0%
the Division of Community Based military
 
00:41:04.829 --> 00:41:04.839 align:start position:0%
programs so think of this in the Last 5
 
00:41:06.910 --> 00:41:06.920 align:start position:0%
Years we're able to partner with
 
00:41:08.790 --> 00:41:08.800 align:start position:0%
Employment Security to establish a
 
00:41:11.670 --> 00:41:11.680 align:start position:0%
veteran friendly Business program what
 
00:41:14.270 --> 00:41:14.280 align:start position:0%
does that mean it means 81 employers um
 
00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
throughout the state of New Hampshire
 
00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:17.440 align:start position:0%
have come to us to fill out an
 
00:41:19.589 --> 00:41:19.599 align:start position:0%
application to say we are a veteran
 
00:41:22.430 --> 00:41:22.440 align:start position:0%
friendly business we want veterans we
 
00:41:24.990 --> 00:41:25.000 align:start position:0%
value what they have as an employer and
 
00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
we want to employ them with a low state
 
00:41:29.950 --> 00:41:29.960 align:start position:0%
uny employment rate you this outc coming
 
00:41:31.069 --> 00:41:31.079 align:start position:0%
year you'll see you know one of the
 
00:41:32.309 --> 00:41:32.319 align:start position:0%
standard things we typically do is
 
00:41:34.750 --> 00:41:34.760 align:start position:0%
called ask the question and think of it
 
00:41:36.630 --> 00:41:36.640 align:start position:0%
like this there's 990,000 veterans in
 
00:41:39.790 --> 00:41:39.800 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire only 30,000
 
00:41:42.430 --> 00:41:42.440 align:start position:0%
30,000 of them receive Care at either
 
00:41:44.470 --> 00:41:44.480 align:start position:0%
the Manchester VA or a White River
 
00:41:47.230 --> 00:41:47.240 align:start position:0%
Junction so 60,000 veterans in the state
 
00:41:48.309 --> 00:41:48.319 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire are going to their
 
00:41:50.990 --> 00:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
primary care of Provider so ask a
 
00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
question what does it do if a veteran
 
00:41:55.030 --> 00:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
goes to their primary care provider
 
00:41:56.349 --> 00:41:56.359 align:start position:0%
they're simply supposed to ask the
 
00:41:59.030 --> 00:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
question is have you served and if you
 
00:42:01.069 --> 00:42:01.079 align:start position:0%
serve then it generates a different list
 
00:42:03.150 --> 00:42:03.160 align:start position:0%
of questions to try to make sure that
 
00:42:04.470 --> 00:42:04.480 align:start position:0%
veteran gets the appropriate level of
 
00:42:06.430 --> 00:42:06.440 align:start position:0%
care that he may he or she may
 
00:42:08.589 --> 00:42:08.599 align:start position:0%
need there's other programs and
 
00:42:11.390 --> 00:42:11.400 align:start position:0%
initiatives um before I bring up the
 
00:42:14.270 --> 00:42:14.280 align:start position:0%
staff of each each of our um directors
 
00:42:16.510 --> 00:42:16.520 align:start position:0%
of each of our three divisions of of
 
00:42:18.510 --> 00:42:18.520 align:start position:0%
veteran services um do you have any
 
00:42:19.710 --> 00:42:19.720 align:start position:0%
questions of
 
00:42:23.950 --> 00:42:23.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:26.069 --> 00:42:26.079 align:start position:0%
ma'am um so thank you for that
 
00:42:30.309 --> 00:42:30.319 align:start position:0%
information Major General meles um uh P
 
00:42:32.470 --> 00:42:32.480 align:start position:0%
Air National Guard bases in my districts
 
00:42:34.910 --> 00:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
that's certainly important to to myself
 
00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
and my constituents and I have heard
 
00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
about this incredible refueling aircraft
 
00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
um so you mentioned that the
 
00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
um the the VA provide VA provides
 
00:42:51.390 --> 00:42:51.400 align:start position:0%
Healthcare the National Guard is
 
00:42:54.270 --> 00:42:54.280 align:start position:0%
separate from that if
 
00:42:57.190 --> 00:42:57.200 align:start position:0%
a if someone were looking for mental
 
00:42:58.750 --> 00:42:58.760 align:start position:0%
Health Services would they go through
 
00:43:01.109 --> 00:43:01.119 align:start position:0%
the VA and or are you providing support
 
00:43:05.230 --> 00:43:05.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:08.750 --> 00:43:08.760 align:start position:0%
Guard both okay so a National Guard
 
00:43:10.870 --> 00:43:10.880 align:start position:0%
service member can get Mental Health
 
00:43:14.190 --> 00:43:14.200 align:start position:0%
Services through our um behavioral
 
00:43:16.270 --> 00:43:16.280 align:start position:0%
health program and we call it beyond the
 
00:43:18.150 --> 00:43:18.160 align:start position:0%
yellow ribbon where we have a sort of
 
00:43:20.790 --> 00:43:20.800 align:start position:0%
significant group of uh individuals to
 
00:43:23.190 --> 00:43:23.200 align:start position:0%
support guard members um and I would
 
00:43:25.150 --> 00:43:25.160 align:start position:0%
also say if that uh person is eligible
 
00:43:26.670 --> 00:43:26.680 align:start position:0%
for the VA they can do that as well
 
00:43:30.589 --> 00:43:30.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:33.430 --> 00:43:33.440 align:start position:0%
you R
 
00:43:37.829 --> 00:43:37.839 align:start position:0%
gagy thank you Mr chairman General uh
 
00:43:40.109 --> 00:43:40.119 align:start position:0%
not really a question but I was one of
 
00:43:44.069 --> 00:43:44.079 align:start position:0%
the last uh ride alongs on the old
 
00:43:46.630 --> 00:43:46.640 align:start position:0%
tanker and I had a nice conversation
 
00:43:49.109 --> 00:43:49.119 align:start position:0%
with the boom operator whatever their
 
00:43:52.270 --> 00:43:52.280 align:start position:0%
designation is not very happy with the
 
00:43:54.390 --> 00:43:54.400 align:start position:0%
new ones as far as uh they wouldn't be
 
00:43:57.309 --> 00:43:57.319 align:start position:0%
able to everything was was going to be
 
00:43:59.870 --> 00:43:59.880 align:start position:0%
on computer am I correct
 
00:44:03.630 --> 00:44:03.640 align:start position:0%
yes and I just want you to know that
 
00:44:06.109 --> 00:44:06.119 align:start position:0%
this Airman was not very pleased with
 
00:44:07.470 --> 00:44:07.480 align:start position:0%
that because they like to get right on
 
00:44:09.549 --> 00:44:09.559 align:start position:0%
their stomachs and really look at what
 
00:44:13.630 --> 00:44:13.640 align:start position:0%
was going on so I I imagine they had to
 
00:44:16.069 --> 00:44:16.079 align:start position:0%
adjust yeah so what the representative
 
00:44:17.829 --> 00:44:17.839 align:start position:0%
is alluding to is
 
00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
um like it's not as fun like if we were
 
00:44:24.470 --> 00:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
to give you or sorry our Airman like a
 
00:44:26.270 --> 00:44:26.280 align:start position:0%
flight on one of our refers the old
 
00:44:29.710 --> 00:44:29.720 align:start position:0%
Eisenhower refueler there's a back glass
 
00:44:32.510 --> 00:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
sort of bubble that a boom operator
 
00:44:34.470 --> 00:44:34.480 align:start position:0%
would lie in and he would have a toggle
 
00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
switch to sort of guide the uh the fuel
 
00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
boom into the receiver and it was all
 
00:44:44.109 --> 00:44:44.119 align:start position:0%
visual um you know modern technology
 
00:44:48.950 --> 00:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
it's now uh a 3D screen so it's almost
 
00:44:52.270 --> 00:44:52.280 align:start position:0%
uh like a computer game and I don't say
 
00:44:55.349 --> 00:44:55.359 align:start position:0%
that to denigrate it um it's it's
 
00:44:59.990 --> 00:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
follow up just a comment from me that
 
00:45:06.470 --> 00:45:06.480 align:start position:0%
I've never been so high in my life
 
00:45:09.109 --> 00:45:09.119 align:start position:0%
yeah I asked them how high we were and
 
00:45:10.670 --> 00:45:10.680 align:start position:0%
they they wouldn't tell me how high we
 
00:45:13.870 --> 00:45:13.880 align:start position:0%
were but I know I flew at 33,000 ft and
 
00:45:17.829 --> 00:45:17.839 align:start position:0%
we were not at 33,000 ft yeah he gets
 
00:45:22.150 --> 00:45:22.160 align:start position:0%
called to an old PL I suppose so
 
00:45:24.510 --> 00:45:24.520 align:start position:0%
yeah you've never been so high in your
 
00:45:26.549 --> 00:45:26.559 align:start position:0%
life that that got my attention
 
00:45:30.470 --> 00:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
represent of u g um other
 
00:45:33.750 --> 00:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
questions Ron Rollins thank you Mr
 
00:45:35.349 --> 00:45:35.359 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you general for taking my
 
00:45:37.030 --> 00:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
question couple of things we've worked
 
00:45:39.470 --> 00:45:39.480 align:start position:0%
on a number of bills to help the uh
 
00:45:42.589 --> 00:45:42.599 align:start position:0%
National Guard with with Recruitment and
 
00:45:44.349 --> 00:45:44.359 align:start position:0%
and I want to know how how are those
 
00:45:46.309 --> 00:45:46.319 align:start position:0%
programs working and how is the
 
00:45:48.109 --> 00:45:48.119 align:start position:0%
recruitment going right now how many are
 
00:45:50.270 --> 00:45:50.280 align:start position:0%
you down that you can still use Etc
 
00:45:52.430 --> 00:45:52.440 align:start position:0%
thank you um thank you representative uh
 
00:45:54.030 --> 00:45:54.040 align:start position:0%
for bringing that up because I forgot to
 
00:45:56.990 --> 00:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
uh address that so thank you um
 
00:45:58.950 --> 00:45:58.960 align:start position:0%
International Guard were're 100% fully
 
00:46:03.750 --> 00:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
made of the 1,68 positions we have every
 
00:46:06.030 --> 00:46:06.040 align:start position:0%
single one is filled so recruiting and
 
00:46:07.589 --> 00:46:07.599 align:start position:0%
retention the International Guard is not
 
00:46:09.510 --> 00:46:09.520 align:start position:0%
an issue I think part of it is the
 
00:46:10.950 --> 00:46:10.960 align:start position:0%
educational benefit and proximity to
 
00:46:12.870 --> 00:46:12.880 align:start position:0%
being a UNH because we employ a lot of
 
00:46:14.990 --> 00:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
young college students on the Army guard
 
00:46:18.670 --> 00:46:18.680 align:start position:0%
is somewhat of a challenge um we have to
 
00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:20.640 align:start position:0%
be exact
 
00:46:24.190 --> 00:46:24.200 align:start position:0%
1,757 positions and we have about 170
 
00:46:26.390 --> 00:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
vacancies so we have about a 10%
 
00:46:28.990 --> 00:46:29.000 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate what we're finding now
 
00:46:31.710 --> 00:46:31.720 align:start position:0%
is postco is you were over the
 
00:46:35.030 --> 00:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
recruiting assession challenge you our
 
00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:36.720 align:start position:0%
recruiters are getting back into high
 
00:46:40.309 --> 00:46:40.319 align:start position:0%
schools uh there's L there's more of the
 
00:46:43.349 --> 00:46:43.359 align:start position:0%
youth are coming out again and so we
 
00:46:45.230 --> 00:46:45.240 align:start position:0%
actually in the Army guard had one of
 
00:46:47.710 --> 00:46:47.720 align:start position:0%
our best years ever in a sessions of
 
00:46:50.069 --> 00:46:50.079 align:start position:0%
what we call non-prior service which for
 
00:46:51.549 --> 00:46:51.559 align:start position:0%
you means a kid who's never served
 
00:46:54.510 --> 00:46:54.520 align:start position:0%
before um we Pro prob approximately
 
00:46:57.150 --> 00:46:57.160 align:start position:0%
brought in about 200 soldiers last year
 
00:46:59.870 --> 00:46:59.880 align:start position:0%
the challenge for us is um for those of
 
00:47:02.470 --> 00:47:02.480 align:start position:0%
you like probably remember is um a lot
 
00:47:04.630 --> 00:47:04.640 align:start position:0%
of people don't make the military career
 
00:47:06.829 --> 00:47:06.839 align:start position:0%
you know a lot of people serve they'll
 
00:47:09.510 --> 00:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
do their that first term enlistment and
 
00:47:10.910 --> 00:47:10.920 align:start position:0%
then they they get out because they got
 
00:47:12.430 --> 00:47:12.440 align:start position:0%
the college they got the GI Bill and
 
00:47:13.589 --> 00:47:13.599 align:start position:0%
they're happy they serve their nation
 
00:47:15.069 --> 00:47:15.079 align:start position:0%
and they just move on to their next step
 
00:47:17.309 --> 00:47:17.319 align:start position:0%
stepping stone so the challenge for us
 
00:47:19.109 --> 00:47:19.119 align:start position:0%
is we're unlike a probably private
 
00:47:21.430 --> 00:47:21.440 align:start position:0%
sector civilian employer we have
 
00:47:24.309 --> 00:47:24.319 align:start position:0%
constant CH in our fors like every year
 
00:47:27.270 --> 00:47:27.280 align:start position:0%
we have to recruit about 10% of a new
 
00:47:29.190 --> 00:47:29.200 align:start position:0%
force and then every year 10% of the
 
00:47:31.470 --> 00:47:31.480 align:start position:0%
force leaves so it's not like you have
 
00:47:33.309 --> 00:47:33.319 align:start position:0%
you're a stable employer in a sense that
 
00:47:35.270 --> 00:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
um you know people like what they do but
 
00:47:36.910 --> 00:47:36.920 align:start position:0%
it's just it's the nature of the
 
00:47:38.750 --> 00:47:38.760 align:start position:0%
business when an 18-year-old person
 
00:47:41.150 --> 00:47:41.160 align:start position:0%
joins they typically will join for the
 
00:47:43.270 --> 00:47:43.280 align:start position:0%
service and the college
 
00:47:46.710 --> 00:47:46.720 align:start position:0%
benefits and the challenge for us now is
 
00:47:50.549 --> 00:47:50.559 align:start position:0%
is retention how do we keep people in so
 
00:47:52.230 --> 00:47:52.240 align:start position:0%
the legislature has been extremely
 
00:47:53.870 --> 00:47:53.880 align:start position:0%
invaluable to us over the past couple of
 
00:47:56.150 --> 00:47:56.160 align:start position:0%
years are trying to expand some of our
 
00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:57.750 align:start position:0%
years are trying to expand some of our
retention

00:47:57.750 --> 00:47:57.760 align:start position:0%
retention
 
00:48:00.390 --> 00:48:00.400 align:start position:0%
uh um opportunities to try to keep
 
00:48:02.990 --> 00:48:03.000 align:start position:0%
service members in and there's two or
 
00:48:06.069 --> 00:48:06.079 align:start position:0%
three that have been exceptional one was
 
00:48:08.309 --> 00:48:08.319 align:start position:0%
if you reinlist in a Hampshire National
 
00:48:10.630 --> 00:48:10.640 align:start position:0%
Guard we were the second state in the
 
00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
nation you can now transfer that to free
 
00:48:15.309 --> 00:48:15.319 align:start position:0%
tuition waiver to your
 
00:48:19.109 --> 00:48:19.119 align:start position:0%
spouse you it's it's helping um it it
 
00:48:21.109 --> 00:48:21.119 align:start position:0%
hasn't had a significant impact as we
 
00:48:23.390 --> 00:48:23.400 align:start position:0%
thought it would but the whole point is
 
00:48:25.390 --> 00:48:25.400 align:start position:0%
like you know sometimes we'll say like
 
00:48:27.230 --> 00:48:27.240 align:start position:0%
the service member volunteer well the
 
00:48:29.430 --> 00:48:29.440 align:start position:0%
service member joins but the family gets
 
00:48:32.109 --> 00:48:32.119 align:start position:0%
drafted and so how do we uh cater or
 
00:48:33.510 --> 00:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
accommodate military families for their
 
00:48:35.549 --> 00:48:35.559 align:start position:0%
support of that service member so the
 
00:48:37.470 --> 00:48:37.480 align:start position:0%
free free tuition waiver transfer to
 
00:48:41.270 --> 00:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
your spouse has been good it hasn't been
 
00:48:44.309 --> 00:48:44.319 align:start position:0%
a cure all the next challenge we have is
 
00:48:46.829 --> 00:48:46.839 align:start position:0%
um there's no more 20-year golden
 
00:48:49.150 --> 00:48:49.160 align:start position:0%
handshake there's no more 20 year go on
 
00:48:51.230 --> 00:48:51.240 align:start position:0%
active duty or go on the garden 20 years
 
00:48:52.990 --> 00:48:53.000 align:start position:0%
you get this retirement 50% of your
 
00:48:57.069 --> 00:48:57.079 align:start position:0%
retirement pay um we're a 401k now so
 
00:48:58.870 --> 00:48:58.880 align:start position:0%
Congress changed this about five years
 
00:49:02.270 --> 00:49:02.280 align:start position:0%
ago that there's no 20y year hey stay
 
00:49:04.069 --> 00:49:04.079 align:start position:0%
this long and this is a retirement that
 
00:49:06.670 --> 00:49:06.680 align:start position:0%
you get it's it's called Blended
 
00:49:10.829 --> 00:49:10.839 align:start position:0%
retirement system uh it's a 401k program
 
00:49:12.910 --> 00:49:12.920 align:start position:0%
so any service member can get out with
 
00:49:15.910 --> 00:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
that 401k in that match so it's the
 
00:49:19.430 --> 00:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
challenge for us now is keeping the
 
00:49:21.990 --> 00:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
junior Enlisted the sergeant into a
 
00:49:23.470 --> 00:49:23.480 align:start position:0%
second term Of
 
00:49:25.950 --> 00:49:25.960 align:start position:0%
Enlistment and last year you all
 
00:49:27.789 --> 00:49:27.799 align:start position:0%
supported us with coming up with what's
 
00:49:31.030 --> 00:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
called a state retention bonus and what
 
00:49:32.309 --> 00:49:32.319 align:start position:0%
it allow us to do as we're trying to
 
00:49:35.390 --> 00:49:35.400 align:start position:0%
finish the policy like now is if you're
 
00:49:38.270 --> 00:49:38.280 align:start position:0%
in a specific job for instance an
 
00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
infantryman and you do not qualify for a
 
00:49:45.349 --> 00:49:45.359 align:start position:0%
federal retention bonus we will give you
 
00:49:48.230 --> 00:49:48.240 align:start position:0%
a uh State retention bonus and right now
 
00:49:50.470 --> 00:49:50.480 align:start position:0%
it's nominal it's $44,000 for two years
 
00:49:52.789 --> 00:49:52.799 align:start position:0%
if you reinlist but we feel like that's
 
00:49:55.910 --> 00:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
a bridging strategy to get him to some
 
00:49:59.510 --> 00:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
sort of other uh additional benefits so
 
00:50:02.069 --> 00:50:02.079 align:start position:0%
to answer your question is 10%
 
00:50:05.589 --> 00:50:05.599 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate in the Army guard um
 
00:50:08.309 --> 00:50:08.319 align:start position:0%
we're doing better in recruiting we
 
00:50:10.230 --> 00:50:10.240 align:start position:0%
struggle with retention of the firsttime
 
00:50:11.950 --> 00:50:11.960 align:start position:0%
kid who comes in and then doesn't want
 
00:50:11.960 --> 00:50:16.270 align:start position:0%
kid who comes in and then doesn't want
to

00:50:16.270 --> 00:50:16.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:18.309 --> 00:50:18.319 align:start position:0%
reinlist representative
 
00:50:20.750 --> 00:50:20.760 align:start position:0%
Belzer thank you Mr chairman uh thank
 
00:50:22.510 --> 00:50:22.520 align:start position:0%
you for being here and for taking my
 
00:50:24.789 --> 00:50:24.799 align:start position:0%
question um I'm looking for a little bit
 
00:50:27.309 --> 00:50:27.319 align:start position:0%
of information regarding the over all
 
00:50:29.950 --> 00:50:29.960 align:start position:0%
outlook on recruiting and retention of
 
00:50:32.710 --> 00:50:32.720 align:start position:0%
uh of our soldiers and I'm looking for a
 
00:50:33.950 --> 00:50:33.960 align:start position:0%
little information I don't know if you
 
00:50:36.430 --> 00:50:36.440 align:start position:0%
have it on hand on both ends on the end
 
00:50:40.510 --> 00:50:40.520 align:start position:0%
of is there any surveying done of um the
 
00:50:43.109 --> 00:50:43.119 align:start position:0%
young people who were to see what the
 
00:50:45.150 --> 00:50:45.160 align:start position:0%
top reasons are that they might not be
 
00:50:47.589 --> 00:50:47.599 align:start position:0%
joining and particularly any data that's
 
00:50:50.789 --> 00:50:50.799 align:start position:0%
broken out um among those who are
 
00:50:52.710 --> 00:50:52.720 align:start position:0%
otherwise inclined or likely to be
 
00:50:54.710 --> 00:50:54.720 align:start position:0%
joining as well as on the other side of
 
00:50:57.549 --> 00:50:57.559 align:start position:0%
the coin um what are the top reasons for
 
00:51:00.069 --> 00:51:00.079 align:start position:0%
rejection of anyone trying to join and
 
00:51:02.829 --> 00:51:02.839 align:start position:0%
have there been any changes in numbers
 
00:51:06.150 --> 00:51:06.160 align:start position:0%
uh percentages of rejected
 
00:51:09.069 --> 00:51:09.079 align:start position:0%
candidates so generally speaking the
 
00:51:10.870 --> 00:51:10.880 align:start position:0%
biggest challenge we have with
 
00:51:13.750 --> 00:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
recruiting is a childhood
 
00:51:18.390 --> 00:51:18.400 align:start position:0%
obesity uh only 17 and 19% of today's
 
00:51:21.270 --> 00:51:21.280 align:start position:0%
youth is eligible for military service
 
00:51:22.789 --> 00:51:22.799 align:start position:0%
because they can't pass the fitness test
 
00:51:24.829 --> 00:51:24.839 align:start position:0%
and they're overweight so it's a
 
00:51:26.109 --> 00:51:26.119 align:start position:0%
challenge and then like sometimes you'll
 
00:51:28.309 --> 00:51:28.319 align:start position:0%
hear the to serve that's been a
 
00:51:32.349 --> 00:51:32.359 align:start position:0%
decline uh I would offer to you that uh
 
00:51:35.109 --> 00:51:35.119 align:start position:0%
I believe every service met the
 
00:51:36.950 --> 00:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
recruiting goals last year the active
 
00:51:38.990 --> 00:51:39.000 align:start position:0%
duty Army Navy Marine Corps Marines I
 
00:51:40.630 --> 00:51:40.640 align:start position:0%
believe and you might have to fact check
 
00:51:42.990 --> 00:51:43.000 align:start position:0%
me on that but I'm pretty sure like the
 
00:51:45.589 --> 00:51:45.599 align:start position:0%
Army was activ Army was in a hole on the
 
00:51:47.190 --> 00:51:47.200 align:start position:0%
Marines always make their numbers um
 
00:51:49.430 --> 00:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
because they're a small service um but
 
00:51:51.109 --> 00:51:51.119 align:start position:0%
generally speaking there's been an I
 
00:51:53.829 --> 00:51:53.839 align:start position:0%
would say an uptake in ass
 
00:51:55.950 --> 00:51:55.960 align:start position:0%
sessions I would say for the retention
 
00:51:57.670 --> 00:51:57.680 align:start position:0%
pieces we try to do surveys to say you
 
00:52:01.910 --> 00:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
know why are you getting out um you
 
00:52:05.549 --> 00:52:05.559 align:start position:0%
generally speaking um they've served and
 
00:52:07.789 --> 00:52:07.799 align:start position:0%
they' they did their
 
00:52:11.789 --> 00:52:11.799 align:start position:0%
time and and that's it and you got to
 
00:52:11.799 --> 00:52:13.109 align:start position:0%
time and and that's it and you got to
realize

00:52:13.109 --> 00:52:13.119 align:start position:0%
realize
 
00:52:17.190 --> 00:52:17.200 align:start position:0%
um a week and a month gets old to people
 
00:52:19.589 --> 00:52:19.599 align:start position:0%
when you start missing like birthdays
 
00:52:23.069 --> 00:52:23.079 align:start position:0%
anniversaries and family events so and
 
00:52:24.470 --> 00:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
sometimes what we ask of our service
 
00:52:26.670 --> 00:52:26.680 align:start position:0%
members because the different units have
 
00:52:29.150 --> 00:52:29.160 align:start position:0%
different um what we call operational
 
00:52:32.910 --> 00:52:32.920 align:start position:0%
Tempo so for example if uh like field
 
00:52:35.510 --> 00:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
artillery so New Hampshire has this this
 
00:52:37.270 --> 00:52:37.280 align:start position:0%
rocket system called the high Mars High
 
00:52:39.950 --> 00:52:39.960 align:start position:0%
Mobility a mobile uh artillery rocket
 
00:52:42.109 --> 00:52:42.119 align:start position:0%
system you probably hear about them in
 
00:52:46.910 --> 00:52:46.920 align:start position:0%
Ukraine um that is a lethal uh weapon
 
00:52:48.670 --> 00:52:48.680 align:start position:0%
system that is in high
 
00:52:51.109 --> 00:52:51.119 align:start position:0%
demand our soldiers will deploy every
 
00:52:53.549 --> 00:52:53.559 align:start position:0%
four to 5 years like clockwork to the
 
00:52:58.589 --> 00:52:58.599 align:start position:0%
Middle East um The Challenge is um most
 
00:53:00.190 --> 00:53:00.200 align:start position:0%
volunteer and like are willingly and
 
00:53:02.789 --> 00:53:02.799 align:start position:0%
happy to go but then it's almost when
 
00:53:04.910 --> 00:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
you come back been there seen I've done
 
00:53:08.109 --> 00:53:08.119 align:start position:0%
it I'm I'm going my I need to finish my
 
00:53:09.870 --> 00:53:09.880 align:start position:0%
college education I need to like I get
 
00:53:11.870 --> 00:53:11.880 align:start position:0%
establish in a civilian career and so
 
00:53:14.549 --> 00:53:14.559 align:start position:0%
there's just there's there's nothing
 
00:53:16.309 --> 00:53:16.319 align:start position:0%
specific and I'm not trying to answer on
 
00:53:17.630 --> 00:53:17.640 align:start position:0%
the question but there's just a lot of
 
00:53:20.109 --> 00:53:20.119 align:start position:0%
little variables that sort of impact
 
00:53:21.390 --> 00:53:21.400 align:start position:0%
then you might go to another unit that
 
00:53:23.510 --> 00:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
says uh I've never left my Armory in 5
 
00:53:26.470 --> 00:53:26.480 align:start position:0%
years um you know we have two state
 
00:53:27.549 --> 00:53:27.559 align:start position:0%
partnership programs with foreign
 
00:53:28.910 --> 00:53:28.920 align:start position:0%
countries one in Al Salvador and one
 
00:53:31.190 --> 00:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
with Cabo Verde the West African island
 
00:53:33.390 --> 00:53:33.400 align:start position:0%
nation why because it's a global chess
 
00:53:35.789 --> 00:53:35.799 align:start position:0%
board it's all about allies and partners
 
00:53:38.750 --> 00:53:38.760 align:start position:0%
and a terance for China so right you got
 
00:53:40.349 --> 00:53:40.359 align:start position:0%
to be on the field to compete so every
 
00:53:41.829 --> 00:53:41.839 align:start position:0%
month we're sending soldiers and Airmen
 
00:53:44.190 --> 00:53:44.200 align:start position:0%
to those two countries and almost like
 
00:53:46.430 --> 00:53:46.440 align:start position:0%
exchange programs so the challenge is
 
00:53:48.549 --> 00:53:48.559 align:start position:0%
like soldiers and Airmen want to do
 
00:53:50.510 --> 00:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
something um and it's always trying to
 
00:53:52.069 --> 00:53:52.079 align:start position:0%
find that balance of too much or too
 
00:53:52.079 --> 00:53:57.349 align:start position:0%
find that balance of too much or too
little

00:53:57.349 --> 00:53:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:59.030 --> 00:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
representative the representative from
 
00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:00.549 align:start position:0%
representative the representative from
Portsmouth

00:54:00.549 --> 00:54:00.559 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth
 
00:54:03.470 --> 00:54:03.480 align:start position:0%
please thank you Mr chairman um could
 
00:54:06.030 --> 00:54:06.040 align:start position:0%
you just elaborate a little bit more on
 
00:54:08.109 --> 00:54:08.119 align:start position:0%
what those Partnerships look like what
 
00:54:10.109 --> 00:54:10.119 align:start position:0%
the purpose is and what they
 
00:54:12.789 --> 00:54:12.799 align:start position:0%
do so the uh National Guard Bureau
 
00:54:16.230 --> 00:54:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:21.950 --> 00:54:21.960 align:start position:0%
the um in the fall of a the the Cold War
 
00:54:26.510 --> 00:54:26.520 align:start position:0%
um of the Eastern block nations in 1993
 
00:54:28.390 --> 00:54:28.400 align:start position:0%
National Guard Bureau established with
 
00:54:30.309 --> 00:54:30.319 align:start position:0%
the state department a partnership
 
00:54:32.630 --> 00:54:32.640 align:start position:0%
program and it started as a military to
 
00:54:34.510 --> 00:54:34.520 align:start position:0%
military engagement with Eastern block
 
00:54:38.069 --> 00:54:38.079 align:start position:0%
countries to not to sort of um you know
 
00:54:40.470 --> 00:54:40.480 align:start position:0%
upset Russia immediately and um so it's
 
00:54:41.789 --> 00:54:41.799 align:start position:0%
just trying to bring in like sort of
 
00:54:44.230 --> 00:54:44.240 align:start position:0%
Western Doctrine and Western standards
 
00:54:47.270 --> 00:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
to a lot of developing nations that
 
00:54:49.270 --> 00:54:49.280 align:start position:0%
partnership program has explained around
 
00:54:52.430 --> 00:54:52.440 align:start position:0%
the globe so of the 54 states in
 
00:54:54.950 --> 00:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
territories uh there's probably about
 
00:54:58.030 --> 00:54:58.040 align:start position:0%
110 Partnerships right now so New
 
00:55:00.190 --> 00:55:00.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um get his partnership with El
 
00:55:02.190 --> 00:55:02.200 align:start position:0%
Salvador in 2000 for the reasons why I
 
00:55:03.750 --> 00:55:03.760 align:start position:0%
cannot tell you it's just way before my
 
00:55:06.510 --> 00:55:06.520 align:start position:0%
time and in 2022 we got our second
 
00:55:08.510 --> 00:55:08.520 align:start position:0%
partnership program with Cape Verde Cabo
 
00:55:10.750 --> 00:55:10.760 align:start position:0%
Verde and part of the reason why is um
 
00:55:12.069 --> 00:55:12.079 align:start position:0%
with those is
 
00:55:15.069 --> 00:55:15.079 align:start position:0%
um they're generally Western leaning
 
00:55:16.950 --> 00:55:16.960 align:start position:0%
democracies that either support the
 
00:55:18.870 --> 00:55:18.880 align:start position:0%
United States either in the United
 
00:55:22.829 --> 00:55:22.839 align:start position:0%
Nations or in in in other Arenas and um
 
00:55:26.630 --> 00:55:26.640 align:start position:0%
it's all about just uh deterrence in
 
00:55:28.390 --> 00:55:28.400 align:start position:0%
This Global chess board against our
 
00:55:30.470 --> 00:55:30.480 align:start position:0%
adversaries to ensure that that you know
 
00:55:31.829 --> 00:55:31.839 align:start position:0%
they're sort of incorporating sort of
 
00:55:34.270 --> 00:55:34.280 align:start position:0%
like us Doctrine and opportunities the
 
00:55:36.109 --> 00:55:36.119 align:start position:0%
beauty or value is we go hold of
 
00:55:38.230 --> 00:55:38.240 align:start position:0%
government and so the previous governor
 
00:55:40.029 --> 00:55:40.039 align:start position:0%
came with us uh with the commission of
 
00:55:41.870 --> 00:55:41.880 align:start position:0%
econom business and E economic Affairs
 
00:55:43.990 --> 00:55:44.000 align:start position:0%
and we brought them the Cabo Verde to
 
00:55:46.349 --> 00:55:46.359 align:start position:0%
engage with sort of Business Development
 
00:55:48.069 --> 00:55:48.079 align:start position:0%
and since that time like we've developed
 
00:55:49.589 --> 00:55:49.599 align:start position:0%
when we've had Dartmouth tuck School of
 
00:55:51.109 --> 00:55:51.119 align:start position:0%
Business do actually case studies
 
00:55:53.390 --> 00:55:53.400 align:start position:0%
through their MBA program for Cabo Verde
 
00:55:55.430 --> 00:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
and it has been utterly exceptional and
 
00:55:58.309 --> 00:55:58.319 align:start position:0%
the last one they just did was um leanx
 
00:56:00.829 --> 00:56:00.839 align:start position:0%
Sigma so the biggest botling company in
 
00:56:03.109 --> 00:56:03.119 align:start position:0%
Cabo Verde wanted to improve its Energy
 
00:56:04.990 --> 00:56:05.000 align:start position:0%
Efficiency and sort of waste
 
00:56:07.150 --> 00:56:07.160 align:start position:0%
reduction and the dartman tuch School of
 
00:56:08.950 --> 00:56:08.960 align:start position:0%
Business did a case study for that that
 
00:56:10.870 --> 00:56:10.880 align:start position:0%
business so those are the opportunities
 
00:56:12.630 --> 00:56:12.640 align:start position:0%
of H of government when we talk about is
 
00:56:15.190 --> 00:56:15.200 align:start position:0%

refer to you Deputy tag uh um if if you
 
00:59:03.789 --> 00:59:03.799 align:start position:0%
take a just a couple moments and tell a
 
00:59:06.510 --> 00:59:06.520 align:start position:0%
committee in in Your Capacity as Deputy
 
00:59:08.670 --> 00:59:08.680 align:start position:0%
you know Warren is the general said was
 
00:59:10.430 --> 00:59:10.440 align:start position:0%

00:59:13.230 --> 00:59:13.240 align:start position:0%
Parish here in conquer and he was here
 
00:59:15.390 --> 00:59:15.400 align:start position:0%
often uh answering questions and doing a
 
00:59:18.670 --> 00:59:18.680 align:start position:0%
great job um so if you could take just a
 
00:59:20.950 --> 00:59:20.960 align:start position:0%
maybe a minute or so and and tell us a
 
00:59:23.750 --> 00:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
little bit about the deputy role the
 
00:59:26.190 --> 00:59:26.200 align:start position:0%
deputy role really is the number two for
 
00:59:29.510 --> 00:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
the tag so in in his absence then I act
 
00:59:32.549 --> 00:59:32.559 align:start position:0%
in his stad um obviously I would confer
 
00:59:37.150 --> 00:59:37.160 align:start position:0%
with him and uh I also oversee the um
 
00:59:39.510 --> 00:59:39.520 align:start position:0%
Department of military Affairs and and

00:59:48.990 --> 00:59:49.000 align:start position:0%
delineated we also have a business
 
00:59:51.390 --> 00:59:51.400 align:start position:0%
office who takes care they're kind of
 
00:59:54.870 --> 00:59:54.880 align:start position:0%
like the um administrative umbrella for
 
00:59:57.549 --> 00:59:57.559 align:start position:0%
the Department so they take care of
 
01:00:01.109 --> 01:00:01.119 align:start position:0%
administrative duties they do budgeting
 
01:00:02.750 --> 01:00:02.760 align:start position:0%
and they also make sure that the
 
01:00:05.430 --> 01:00:05.440 align:start position:0%
contracts get executed for the state for
 
01:00:08.029 --> 01:00:08.039 align:start position:0%

01:00:11.789 --> 01:00:11.799 align:start position:0%
spattering of state employees throughout
 
01:00:14.630 --> 01:00:14.640 align:start position:0%
the state so we have some at uh as at
 
01:00:17.309 --> 01:00:17.319 align:start position:0%

going to be beaten by Army because of
 
01:00:58.710 --> 01:00:58.720 align:start position:0%

us thank you very much uh for having me
 
01:02:50.470 --> 01:02:50.480 align:start position:0%
here uh for the record my name is
 
01:02:52.430 --> 01:02:52.440 align:start position:0%
William GD I am the director for the New
 
01:02:54.789 --> 01:02:54.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire division of veteran services
 
01:02:58.829 --> 01:02:58.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:01.029 --> 01:03:01.039 align:start position:0%
I I served 30 years active duty in the
 
01:03:03.029 --> 01:03:03.039 align:start position:0%
Navy retired in
 
01:03:05.470 --> 01:03:05.480 align:start position:0%
2016 uh was a foreign Communications
 
01:03:07.190 --> 01:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
intelligence analyst in the Navy and I
 
01:03:08.710 --> 01:03:08.720 align:start position:0%
thought I was a smart guy until I sat
 
01:03:10.990 --> 01:03:11.000 align:start position:0%
down to do my first VA claim and
 
01:03:12.789 --> 01:03:12.799 align:start position:0%
realized I wasn't as smart I thought as
 
01:03:15.190 --> 01:03:15.200 align:start position:0%
I thought I was and I needed help so I
 
01:03:16.870 --> 01:03:16.880 align:start position:0%
turned to the office of veteran services
 
01:03:19.230 --> 01:03:19.240 align:start position:0%
at the time uh Jamie Cummings who's my
 
01:03:21.870 --> 01:03:21.880 align:start position:0%
number two she was my vsso and after
 
01:03:23.470 --> 01:03:23.480 align:start position:0%
watching what she did I was like oh my
 
01:03:25.309 --> 01:03:25.319 align:start position:0%
God that is my calling that's what I
 
01:03:26.269 --> 01:03:26.279 align:start position:0%
want to do
 
01:03:29.029 --> 01:03:29.039 align:start position:0%
I started off in the agency as a vsso uh
 
01:03:31.430 --> 01:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
which I think is invaluable to uh my
 
01:03:33.549 --> 01:03:33.559 align:start position:0%
position as a director and then shortly
 
01:03:35.510 --> 01:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
after I got to the agency I became the
 
01:03:38.430 --> 01:03:38.440 align:start position:0%
director um so what we do at veteran
 
01:03:41.269 --> 01:03:41.279 align:start position:0%
services uh we we've existed since the
 
01:03:44.230 --> 01:03:44.240 align:start position:0%
40s so uh Congress established that
 
01:03:46.309 --> 01:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
every state must have an office that
 
01:03:47.710 --> 01:03:47.720 align:start position:0%
helps veterans with the process of
 
01:03:50.150 --> 01:03:50.160 align:start position:0%
filing claims prior to that there was no
 
01:03:51.589 --> 01:03:51.599 align:start position:0%
assistance uh they could only turn to
 
01:03:53.430 --> 01:03:53.440 align:start position:0%
lawyers and lawyers charge for their
 
01:03:56.349 --> 01:03:56.359 align:start position:0%
services so uh Congress has that every
 
01:03:57.750 --> 01:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
office every state must have an office
 
01:04:00.029 --> 01:04:00.039 align:start position:0%
to help veterans uh so we came around in
 
01:04:02.430 --> 01:04:02.440 align:start position:0%
the 40s uh we've been doing this work
 
01:04:04.029 --> 01:04:04.039 align:start position:0%
for for a number of years we're really
 
01:04:06.150 --> 01:04:06.160 align:start position:0%
really good at what we do uh when you
 
01:04:08.510 --> 01:04:08.520 align:start position:0%
look at the VA the VA has three worlds
 
01:04:12.230 --> 01:04:12.240 align:start position:0%
health care benefits and Cemetery uh on
 
01:04:14.150 --> 01:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
the healthare side we're not Health Care
 
01:04:15.510 --> 01:04:15.520 align:start position:0%
Professionals so we let the Health Care
 
01:04:17.230 --> 01:04:17.240 align:start position:0%
Professionals take care of our veterans
 
01:04:20.309 --> 01:04:20.319 align:start position:0%
in that world there's the VBA which the
 
01:04:22.710 --> 01:04:22.720 align:start position:0%
benefit side and of course the cemetery
 
01:04:24.150 --> 01:04:24.160 align:start position:0%
veterans know how to get to the cemetery
 
01:04:25.829 --> 01:04:25.839 align:start position:0%
on their own they don't need advocates
 
01:04:28.190 --> 01:04:28.200 align:start position:0%
to help them there so we focus mostly on
 
01:04:31.390 --> 01:04:31.400 align:start position:0%
the VBA world now when you look at the
 
01:04:35.390 --> 01:04:35.400 align:start position:0%
VBA we've got benefits like um the home
 
01:04:38.470 --> 01:04:38.480 align:start position:0%
loan guarantees voke rehab uh things
 
01:04:40.750 --> 01:04:40.760 align:start position:0%
like education but in those worlds
 
01:04:42.670 --> 01:04:42.680 align:start position:0%
you'll have an advocate if you contact a
 
01:04:44.910 --> 01:04:44.920 align:start position:0%
VA you have questions about home loans
 
01:04:46.269 --> 01:04:46.279 align:start position:0%
you'll usually have somebody be able to
 
01:04:47.510 --> 01:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
answer those questions for you and be
 
01:04:49.430 --> 01:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
able to advocate for you when you start
 
01:04:51.269 --> 01:04:51.279 align:start position:0%
talking about VA compensation and
 
01:04:53.109 --> 01:04:53.119 align:start position:0%
pension unfortunately that's where the
 
01:04:54.829 --> 01:04:54.839 align:start position:0%
advocation drops off there's no
 
01:04:56.510 --> 01:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
advocates for that work you're filing
 
01:04:58.510 --> 01:04:58.520 align:start position:0%
claims against the VA they're not going
 
01:05:00.230 --> 01:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
to tell you how to win those claims so
 
01:05:02.230 --> 01:05:02.240 align:start position:0%
you need somebody outside of that world
 
01:05:04.549 --> 01:05:04.559 align:start position:0%
to help you that's why we were
 
01:05:07.109 --> 01:05:07.119 align:start position:0%
established that's why we're there the
 
01:05:09.670 --> 01:05:09.680 align:start position:0%
way that we do that as um the general
 
01:05:13.349 --> 01:05:13.359 align:start position:0%
mentioned we have 10 uh an agency of 10
 
01:05:15.589 --> 01:05:15.599 align:start position:0%
folks myself Jamie Cummins agency
 
01:05:18.510 --> 01:05:18.520 align:start position:0%
supervisor seven service officers and a
 
01:05:21.470 --> 01:05:21.480 align:start position:0%
receptionist uh we do a lot of
 
01:05:24.150 --> 01:05:24.160 align:start position:0%
uh huge work we do a lot of valuable
 
01:05:26.630 --> 01:05:26.640 align:start position:0%
work for for our veterans in the State
 
01:05:28.870 --> 01:05:28.880 align:start position:0%
uh we have about 9,000 active clients
 
01:05:30.349 --> 01:05:30.359 align:start position:0%
right now and we bring about $100
 
01:05:32.069 --> 01:05:32.079 align:start position:0%
million into the state through the
 
01:05:34.029 --> 01:05:34.039 align:start position:0%
pockets of those veterans by helping
 
01:05:36.710 --> 01:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
them with their VA claims uh so we're
 
01:05:38.789 --> 01:05:38.799 align:start position:0%
their Advocate through the entire claims
 
01:05:41.150 --> 01:05:41.160 align:start position:0%
process from start to finish to include
 
01:05:44.910 --> 01:05:44.920 align:start position:0%
appeals um so we do that through those
 
01:05:46.510 --> 01:05:46.520 align:start position:0%
seven service officers and those seven
 
01:05:48.390 --> 01:05:48.400 align:start position:0%
service officers have sites around the
 
01:05:50.789 --> 01:05:50.799 align:start position:0%
state uh we have a site in Portsmouth we
 
01:05:53.190 --> 01:05:53.200 align:start position:0%
have a site down in nashwa two service
 
01:05:55.349 --> 01:05:55.359 align:start position:0%
officers we work out of Manchester uh we
 
01:05:56.589 --> 01:05:56.599 align:start position:0%
have the veteran service offic in
 
01:05:58.549 --> 01:05:58.559 align:start position:0%
conquered one in Kean and then we also
 
01:06:00.349 --> 01:06:00.359 align:start position:0%
service the North Country in Berlin
 
01:06:02.430 --> 01:06:02.440 align:start position:0%
Conway and
 
01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:04.150 align:start position:0%
Conway and
Littleton

01:06:04.150 --> 01:06:04.160 align:start position:0%
Littleton
 
01:06:06.390 --> 01:06:06.400 align:start position:0%
so we do all
 
01:06:09.309 --> 01:06:09.319 align:start position:0%
that we focus most of our efforts on
 
01:06:12.190 --> 01:06:12.200 align:start position:0%
that but I will tell you uh as as me
 
01:06:13.670 --> 01:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
members of this
 
01:06:16.190 --> 01:06:16.200 align:start position:0%
committee um if you have questions about
 
01:06:19.069 --> 01:06:19.079 align:start position:0%
something that is not claim related uh I
 
01:06:21.510 --> 01:06:21.520 align:start position:0%
I provided my business card you you can
 
01:06:23.789 --> 01:06:23.799 align:start position:0%
you can certainly contact me and I'll do
 
01:06:25.109 --> 01:06:25.119 align:start position:0%
the best that I can to answer the
 
01:06:27.390 --> 01:06:27.400 align:start position:0%
question uh our title is veteran
 
01:06:29.309 --> 01:06:29.319 align:start position:0%
services though there are there is a
 
01:06:31.109 --> 01:06:31.119 align:start position:0%
line in the sand as to what veteran
 
01:06:32.670 --> 01:06:32.680 align:start position:0%
services we actually provide and what
 
01:06:35.029 --> 01:06:35.039 align:start position:0%
veteran services we don't provide um and
 
01:06:36.990 --> 01:06:37.000 align:start position:0%
that kind of get confusing to a lot of
 
01:06:39.150 --> 01:06:39.160 align:start position:0%
veterans I actually had a gentleman call
 
01:06:40.910 --> 01:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
me about a month ago asking me for help
 
01:06:43.870 --> 01:06:43.880 align:start position:0%
with laundry it's really not in the
 
01:06:45.670 --> 01:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
realm of what our responsibilities I'm
 
01:06:47.069 --> 01:06:47.079 align:start position:0%
not resourced to help veterans with
 
01:06:49.990 --> 01:06:50.000 align:start position:0%
laundry services um but I did have a
 
01:06:52.910 --> 01:06:52.920 align:start position:0%
conversation with them and um I I I did
 
01:06:54.829 --> 01:06:54.839 align:start position:0%
what I could to assist and that's
 
01:06:57.750 --> 01:06:57.760 align:start position:0%
basically how I do it so um if you have
 
01:06:59.589 --> 01:06:59.599 align:start position:0%
questions if you need some assistance
 
01:07:01.109 --> 01:07:01.119 align:start position:0%
give me a call if there's something we
 
01:07:02.710 --> 01:07:02.720 align:start position:0%
can assist with there's some resources
 
01:07:04.750 --> 01:07:04.760 align:start position:0%
that I'm aware of uh I will help direct
 
01:07:09.510 --> 01:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
you to those so that is me that is
 
01:07:13.269 --> 01:07:13.279 align:start position:0%
us thank you so much William uh question
 
01:07:17.309 --> 01:07:17.319 align:start position:0%
um for me to start here involves service
 
01:07:19.349 --> 01:07:19.359 align:start position:0%
officers uh you know I've been a member
 
01:07:23.430 --> 01:07:23.440 align:start position:0%
of the the legion and the uh VFW and M
 
01:07:25.990 --> 01:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
league and a lot of posts have someone
 
01:07:29.589 --> 01:07:29.599 align:start position:0%
designated as a service officer um some
 
01:07:33.029 --> 01:07:33.039 align:start position:0%
probably better trained or or uh
 
01:07:36.990 --> 01:07:37.000 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable than others so these Post
 
01:07:38.950 --> 01:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
Service officers
 
01:07:41.870 --> 01:07:41.880 align:start position:0%
do help help us in a sin do they have
 
01:07:43.829 --> 01:07:43.839 align:start position:0%
anything to do with your office or that
 
01:07:45.950 --> 01:07:45.960 align:start position:0%
that's just a separate service that the
 
01:07:49.069 --> 01:07:49.079 align:start position:0%
post provides I appreciate the question
 
01:07:50.390 --> 01:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
uh no they don't have anything to do
 
01:07:52.990 --> 01:07:53.000 align:start position:0%
with our office they're usually with
 
01:07:55.309 --> 01:07:55.319 align:start position:0%
that post so if it's American Legion to
 
01:07:57.309 --> 01:07:57.319 align:start position:0%
be American Legion that would assist
 
01:07:59.190 --> 01:07:59.200 align:start position:0%
them so typically I believe the way they
 
01:08:01.670 --> 01:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
work it we have Paul Lloyd who's a a VFW
 
01:08:03.710 --> 01:08:03.720 align:start position:0%
member uh I think the way they working
 
01:08:05.430 --> 01:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
is the Post Service officers take those
 
01:08:07.390 --> 01:08:07.400 align:start position:0%
claims from the veterans and they bring
 
01:08:09.309 --> 01:08:09.319 align:start position:0%
them to the National level Service
 
01:08:11.230 --> 01:08:11.240 align:start position:0%
Officer uh which is located in
 
01:08:14.029 --> 01:08:14.039 align:start position:0%
Manchester so each of the the three big
 
01:08:17.789 --> 01:08:17.799 align:start position:0%
names VFW American Legion DAV uh they
 
01:08:19.550 --> 01:08:19.560 align:start position:0%
work out of the Manchester office on
 
01:08:22.789 --> 01:08:22.799 align:start position:0%
Chestnut Street uh the same as my office
 
01:08:24.189 --> 01:08:24.199 align:start position:0%
uh so it gets really really confusing
 
01:08:25.590 --> 01:08:25.600 align:start position:0%
about the who's who in the zoo when
 
01:08:28.229 --> 01:08:28.239 align:start position:0%
comes to Veterans claims um it's really
 
01:08:31.749 --> 01:08:31.759 align:start position:0%
for me it's about who you find to be uh
 
01:08:34.070 --> 01:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
basically who who who told you to go to
 
01:08:36.189 --> 01:08:36.199 align:start position:0%
who right so there's a lot of veterans
 
01:08:38.030 --> 01:08:38.040 align:start position:0%
that use these services and they like
 
01:08:39.789 --> 01:08:39.799 align:start position:0%
who they speak with so for example John
 
01:08:41.829 --> 01:08:41.839 align:start position:0%
Barrett with the VFW he's an amazing
 
01:08:43.229 --> 01:08:43.239 align:start position:0%
Service Officer he's been doing this for
 
01:08:45.229 --> 01:08:45.239 align:start position:0%

01:08:47.470 --> 01:08:47.480 align:start position:0%

go talk to John you don't have to go to
 
01:08:53.789 --> 01:08:53.799 align:start position:0%
the the the state office uh so we all do
 
01:08:55.870 --> 01:08:55.880 align:start position:0%
the same work we just we just do it
 
01:08:58.229 --> 01:08:58.239 align:start position:0%
differently but but as as to the
 
01:08:59.789 --> 01:08:59.799 align:start position:0%
question so those service officers work
 
01:09:02.110 --> 01:09:02.120 align:start position:0%
for that
 
01:09:04.149 --> 01:09:04.159 align:start position:0%
organization well again thank you for
 
01:09:06.669 --> 01:09:06.679 align:start position:0%
what you do there are many veterans many
 
01:09:09.470 --> 01:09:09.480 align:start position:0%
veterans who never ask for any help
 
01:09:11.630 --> 01:09:11.640 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of help out there and many
 
01:09:13.950 --> 01:09:13.960 align:start position:0%
who need it and deserve it never ask for
 
01:09:15.950 --> 01:09:15.960 align:start position:0%
it never get it and on the other hand
 
01:09:17.870 --> 01:09:17.880 align:start position:0%
there are some squeaky Wheels let's be
 
01:09:21.550 --> 01:09:21.560 align:start position:0%
candid a few that uh are asking for help
 
01:09:23.390 --> 01:09:23.400 align:start position:0%
with their laundry uh and that type of
 
01:09:25.390 --> 01:09:25.400 align:start position:0%
thing and and I occasionally hear from
 
01:09:26.870 --> 01:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
some of those and we try to help
 
01:09:29.390 --> 01:09:29.400 align:start position:0%
everybody but I I know that occasionally
 
01:09:31.390 --> 01:09:31.400 align:start position:0%
it takes some patience on on your part
 
01:09:35.189 --> 01:09:35.199 align:start position:0%
to uh to uh explain to some folks what
 
01:09:38.510 --> 01:09:38.520 align:start position:0%
you can do or should do and can't or or
 
01:09:42.229 --> 01:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
or whatever so uh hopefully we can
 
01:09:45.550 --> 01:09:45.560 align:start position:0%
somehow as we communicate with veterans
 
01:09:48.430 --> 01:09:48.440 align:start position:0%
in our travels uh help them to
 
01:09:50.630 --> 01:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
understand the ones who need help let
 
01:09:53.349 --> 01:09:53.359 align:start position:0%
let's encourage them to get help and and
 
01:09:54.470 --> 01:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
the ones who are looking for other
 
01:09:57.350 --> 01:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
things to Define what's what's realistic
 
01:10:00.870 --> 01:10:00.880 align:start position:0%
and reasonable questions uh for William
 
01:10:03.590 --> 01:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
um we some manal bomb sure uh thank you
 
01:10:05.790 --> 01:10:05.800 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
01:10:09.350 --> 01:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
um so I'm reading about this property
 
01:10:12.189 --> 01:10:12.199 align:start position:0%
tax credit and I see this note that each
 
01:10:14.709 --> 01:10:14.719 align:start position:0%
City must vote and improve this enabling
 
01:10:17.950 --> 01:10:17.960 align:start position:0%
legislation is it the city or town
 
01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:18.790 align:start position:0%
legislation is it the city or town
that's

01:10:18.790 --> 01:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:10:21.709 --> 01:10:21.719 align:start position:0%
determining what the amount of that tax
 
01:10:25.390 --> 01:10:25.400 align:start position:0%
credit is or is that set by veterans
 
01:10:27.590 --> 01:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
Affairs or some other agency and the
 
01:10:32.470 --> 01:10:32.480 align:start position:0%
city is just voting to allow that tax
 
01:10:35.189 --> 01:10:35.199 align:start position:0%
credit great question so essentially
 
01:10:37.390 --> 01:10:37.400 align:start position:0%
there's a minimum and maximum amount and
 
01:10:39.630 --> 01:10:39.640 align:start position:0%
the towns get to decide where in that
 
01:10:41.510 --> 01:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
world they're going to be some towns
 
01:10:43.709 --> 01:10:43.719 align:start position:0%
have gone and opted for the maximum uh
 
01:10:46.110 --> 01:10:46.120 align:start position:0%
that they can grant sometimes or like
 
01:10:48.149 --> 01:10:48.159 align:start position:0%
for seven to the up to 750 for the
 
01:10:50.229 --> 01:10:50.239 align:start position:0%
standard tax credit uh you know there's
 
01:10:51.750 --> 01:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of towns that they were given 200
 
01:10:53.630 --> 01:10:53.640 align:start position:0%
they're given 500 I believe Manchester
 
01:10:56.229 --> 01:10:56.239 align:start position:0%
has given 500 uh for theirs so it's
 
01:10:58.110 --> 01:10:58.120 align:start position:0%
really up to the city to decide and a
 
01:10:59.950 --> 01:10:59.960 align:start position:0%
lot of it they look at it fiscally you
 
01:11:01.030 --> 01:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
know for every nickel you don't take
 
01:11:02.390 --> 01:11:02.400 align:start position:0%
from a veteran you got to take from the
 
01:11:04.430 --> 01:11:04.440 align:start position:0%
the neighbor of a veteran so that's just
 
01:11:06.830 --> 01:11:06.840 align:start position:0%
the way they look at it all right thank
 
01:11:09.790 --> 01:11:09.800 align:start position:0%
you I've got a quick question about that
 
01:11:13.070 --> 01:11:13.080 align:start position:0%
um so do you guys have anywhere where
 
01:11:15.830 --> 01:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
there's like a compiled list online
 
01:11:16.830 --> 01:11:16.840 align:start position:0%
through I don't know one of your
 
01:11:18.910 --> 01:11:18.920 align:start position:0%
websites or anything like that where a
 
01:11:21.630 --> 01:11:21.640 align:start position:0%
veteran can go and see like if their
 
01:11:25.470 --> 01:11:25.480 align:start position:0%
specific area has this credit or is it
 
01:11:27.470 --> 01:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
they do they need to just go to their
 
01:11:29.390 --> 01:11:29.400 align:start position:0%
local website or whatever and look
 
01:11:31.510 --> 01:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
there's um thank you for the question so
 
01:11:33.149 --> 01:11:33.159 align:start position:0%
the Department of Revenue Administration
 
01:11:35.030 --> 01:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
the ra has a website and on their
 
01:11:36.870 --> 01:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
website they do have a spreadsheet uh
 
01:11:38.189 --> 01:11:38.199 align:start position:0%
they do have an Excel spreadsheet that
 
01:11:40.510 --> 01:11:40.520 align:start position:0%
that talks about each City where they're
 
01:11:41.750 --> 01:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
what where they are and all the tax
 
01:11:44.870 --> 01:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
credits okay great thank
 
01:11:47.149 --> 01:11:47.159 align:start position:0%
you anything
 
01:11:50.310 --> 01:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
else to representative mandle bomb's
 
01:11:52.709 --> 01:11:52.719 align:start position:0%
question uh she mentioned the property
 
01:11:55.310 --> 01:11:55.320 align:start position:0%
tax credit there are is is Kevin
 
01:11:56.990 --> 01:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
probably knows there there are several
 
01:11:59.990 --> 01:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
measures in the house this term related
 
01:12:02.430 --> 01:12:02.440 align:start position:0%
to property tax credits there's a couple
 
01:12:04.229 --> 01:12:04.239 align:start position:0%
of them one of which I was asked to help
 
01:12:06.990 --> 01:12:07.000 align:start position:0%
with um to get in the mix that have to
 
01:12:10.030 --> 01:12:10.040 align:start position:0%
do with 100% disabled veterans and
 
01:12:12.070 --> 01:12:12.080 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of confusion about what
 
01:12:14.750 --> 01:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
that means uh not not that we need to
 
01:12:16.470 --> 01:12:16.480 align:start position:0%
get into it here other than to follow up
 
01:12:19.350 --> 01:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
on representative mandal bomb's question
 
01:12:21.870 --> 01:12:21.880 align:start position:0%
in terms of veterans tax credits what's
 
01:12:23.830 --> 01:12:23.840 align:start position:0%
out there and for those that are
 
01:12:26.229 --> 01:12:26.239 align:start position:0%
watching at home or are we'll be
 
01:12:30.070 --> 01:12:30.080 align:start position:0%
watching later the enabling
 
01:12:33.270 --> 01:12:33.280 align:start position:0%
legislation uh that has been passed that
 
01:12:36.270 --> 01:12:36.280 align:start position:0%
is in the mix right now enabling means
 
01:12:39.910 --> 01:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
that should the legislature pass uh a
 
01:12:42.430 --> 01:12:42.440 align:start position:0%
tax credit option for communities the
 
01:12:44.910 --> 01:12:44.920 align:start position:0%
communities don't have to give veterans
 
01:12:48.270 --> 01:12:48.280 align:start position:0%
a tax credit if we pass something uh
 
01:12:52.070 --> 01:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
what we do in in there limits is it the
 
01:12:55.189 --> 01:12:55.199 align:start position:0%
uh the segment that reps of manal bom
 
01:12:58.430 --> 01:12:58.440 align:start position:0%
referred to uh eligible for a tax credit
 
01:13:01.470 --> 01:13:01.480 align:start position:0%
of 50 to 750 on residential property
 
01:13:04.510 --> 01:13:04.520 align:start position:0%
taxes so enabling means the community
 
01:13:06.870 --> 01:13:06.880 align:start position:0%
can decide if they want to do that at
 
01:13:10.950 --> 01:13:10.960 align:start position:0%
all and if if so uh how much uh of a tax
 
01:13:14.110 --> 01:13:14.120 align:start position:0%
CED up to 750 do they want to give and
 
01:13:15.990 --> 01:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
the uh the 100% disabled thing I'm not
 
01:13:18.149 --> 01:13:18.159 align:start position:0%
going to get into here other committees
 
01:13:22.550 --> 01:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
have heard and will hear that um but uh
 
01:13:25.590 --> 01:13:25.600 align:start position:0%
that is something that this legisl this
 
01:13:28.030 --> 01:13:28.040 align:start position:0%
term is going has already started and
 
01:13:29.990 --> 01:13:30.000 align:start position:0%

really a bunch of amazing folks I'll
 
01:14:47.709 --> 01:14:47.719 align:start position:0%
keep it pretty short for your
 
01:14:49.470 --> 01:14:49.480 align:start position:0%
constituents the most important thing is
 
01:14:51.550 --> 01:14:51.560 align:start position:0%
if they're a veteran they can they
 
01:14:53.430 --> 01:14:53.440 align:start position:0%
should apply and if they've ever served
 
01:14:55.430 --> 01:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
in the military should apply I it would
 
01:14:56.910 --> 01:14:56.920 align:start position:0%
bother me if somebody self selects out
 
01:14:58.870 --> 01:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
like oh I'm not sure that if I'm
 
01:15:01.149 --> 01:15:01.159 align:start position:0%
eligible let us make that determination
 
01:15:02.830 --> 01:15:02.840 align:start position:0%
in all likelihood if you've served in
 
01:15:05.669 --> 01:15:05.679 align:start position:0%
the military you are probably eligible
 
01:15:07.270 --> 01:15:07.280 align:start position:0%
as long as you don't have a dishonorable
 
01:15:09.709 --> 01:15:09.719 align:start position:0%

01:15:17.709 --> 01:15:17.719 align:start position:0%
they served in the National Guard or the
 
01:15:19.430 --> 01:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
reserve component but were never
 
01:15:21.790 --> 01:15:21.800 align:start position:0%
activated or did not retire they would
 
01:15:23.510 --> 01:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
not have been eligible previously but
 
01:15:25.030 --> 01:15:25.040 align:start position:0%

01:21:45.910 --> 01:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
a memorial the memorial section is for
 
01:21:48.270 --> 01:21:48.280 align:start position:0%
folks whose remains were lost at sea or
 
01:21:50.070 --> 01:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
been scattered and they cannot be
 
01:21:53.149 --> 01:21:53.159 align:start position:0%
memorialized any place else so so when a
 
01:21:55.950 --> 01:21:55.960 align:start position:0%
when a veteran passes their entitled to
 
01:21:58.629 --> 01:21:58.639 align:start position:0%
a flag military honors and a grave
 
01:22:01.310 --> 01:22:01.320 align:start position:0%
marker yeah um so the memorial section
 
01:22:03.229 --> 01:22:03.239 align:start position:0%
is for example we have a state employee
 
01:22:06.709 --> 01:22:06.719 align:start position:0%
whose uh ex-spouse was killed at C and
 
01:22:08.629 --> 01:22:08.639 align:start position:0%
that remains never recovered so there's
 
01:22:13.310 --> 01:22:13.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:16.229 --> 01:22:16.239 align:start position:0%
you uh repal
 
01:22:19.390 --> 01:22:19.400 align:start position:0%
bomb thank you Mr chairman um so just I
 
01:22:20.950 --> 01:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
have a clarifying question about the
 
01:22:25.350 --> 01:22:25.360 align:start position:0%
application process can spouses or or
 
01:22:28.750 --> 01:22:28.760 align:start position:0%
dependence of someone who served who's
 
01:22:31.590 --> 01:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
passed away apply on their
 
01:22:34.510 --> 01:22:34.520 align:start position:0%
behalf absolutely so believe it or not
 
01:22:36.550 --> 01:22:36.560 align:start position:0%
spouses are eligible even if the veteran
 
01:22:38.669 --> 01:22:38.679 align:start position:0%
chooses not to come the spouse as long
 
01:22:40.310 --> 01:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
as they're married to the veteran at the
 
01:22:42.470 --> 01:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
time of either one of their passing the
 
01:22:44.669 --> 01:22:44.679 align:start position:0%
spouse is eligible they've earned their
 
01:22:48.070 --> 01:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
way in by being a spouse of a veteran so
 
01:22:49.470 --> 01:22:49.480 align:start position:0%
uh they can apply on behalf of the
 
01:22:52.550 --> 01:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
veteran we all we have uh Powers of
 
01:22:54.629 --> 01:22:54.639 align:start position:0%
Attorney as long as we get the proper
 
01:22:56.870 --> 01:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
paperwork and the remains we can get
 
01:22:59.910 --> 01:22:59.920 align:start position:0%
that taken care of thank
 
01:23:02.110 --> 01:23:02.120 align:start position:0%
you quick personal comment there was
 
01:23:03.910 --> 01:23:03.920 align:start position:0%
recently a veteran who passed away a
 
01:23:07.790 --> 01:23:07.800 align:start position:0%
World War II veteran um and he had no
 
01:23:12.870 --> 01:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
family he had uh nobody and so the he
 
01:23:15.310 --> 01:23:15.320 align:start position:0%
was obviously eligible to be buried at
 
01:23:17.669 --> 01:23:17.679 align:start position:0%
the state Veteran Cemetery so the word
 
01:23:19.870 --> 01:23:19.880 align:start position:0%
went out for the veterans community that
 
01:23:22.910 --> 01:23:22.920 align:start position:0%
this uh this individual had had nobody
 
01:23:26.390 --> 01:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
no no family uh for whatever reasons I
 
01:23:29.709 --> 01:23:29.719 align:start position:0%
think he was over 100 years old so uh
 
01:23:31.629 --> 01:23:31.639 align:start position:0%
there were a couple hundred veterans who
 
01:23:34.189 --> 01:23:34.199 align:start position:0%
showed up at his ceremony uh including
 
01:23:37.750 --> 01:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
myself and um just a wonderful example
 
01:23:40.470 --> 01:23:40.480 align:start position:0%
of uh how you folks could accommodate a
 
01:23:42.910 --> 01:23:42.920 align:start position:0%
sudden uh what do you call it a flash
 
01:23:45.709 --> 01:23:45.719 align:start position:0%
mob is that kind of that type of you
 
01:23:48.470 --> 01:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
suddenly 200 people show up at a u in
 
01:23:51.070 --> 01:23:51.080 align:start position:0%
the in the to handle all those vehicles
 
01:23:53.950 --> 01:23:53.960 align:start position:0%
uh was was wonderful I have I do have
 
01:23:55.629 --> 01:23:55.639 align:start position:0%
one question it has to do with capacity
 
01:23:58.590 --> 01:23:58.600 align:start position:0%
and expansion um how much room uh do you
 
01:24:00.590 --> 01:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
have are you are you good for for quite
 
01:24:03.430 --> 01:24:03.440 align:start position:0%
a while or what's how's that look two
 
01:24:04.990 --> 01:24:05.000 align:start position:0%
things I forgot to cover that so first
 
01:24:06.790 --> 01:24:06.800 align:start position:0%
of all regarding uh unaccompanied
 
01:24:08.390 --> 01:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
remains it actually happens more often
 
01:24:10.110 --> 01:24:10.120 align:start position:0%
than you think probably about twice a
 
01:24:12.430 --> 01:24:12.440 align:start position:0%
month we get unaccompanied remains
 
01:24:14.030 --> 01:24:14.040 align:start position:0%
delivered to the cemetery we do have a
 
01:24:16.149 --> 01:24:16.159 align:start position:0%
group you can find it on our website
 
01:24:17.430 --> 01:24:17.440 align:start position:0%
it's called standing with falling
 
01:24:19.910 --> 01:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
comrades we have about 300 folks on that
 
01:24:22.350 --> 01:24:22.360 align:start position:0%
list so if I'm given any kind of warning
 
01:24:24.430 --> 01:24:24.440 align:start position:0%
I'll send out an email to that group we
 
01:24:27.270 --> 01:24:27.280 align:start position:0%
never bury anybody alone so at a minimum
 
01:24:29.430 --> 01:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
myself my staff will go out to be with
 
01:24:31.750 --> 01:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
those remains and the military always
 
01:24:33.950 --> 01:24:33.960 align:start position:0%
does honors we they never take shortcuts
 
01:24:35.590 --> 01:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
they fold the flag they play Taps
 
01:24:37.590 --> 01:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
everybody gets honors um but that's
 
01:24:39.350 --> 01:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
standing with falling comrades that that
 
01:24:41.350 --> 01:24:41.360 align:start position:0%
one that you're talking about Sir that
 
01:24:43.990 --> 01:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
one was done by the folks I think it was
 
01:24:47.229 --> 01:24:47.239 align:start position:0%
a uh VFW or American Legion Post down in
 
01:24:48.910 --> 01:24:48.920 align:start position:0%
Brookline or something that got it on
 
01:24:51.590 --> 01:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
the news and things got a couple hundred
 
01:24:53.070 --> 01:24:53.080 align:start position:0%
folks showed up not just veterans just
 
01:24:54.390 --> 01:24:54.400 align:start position:0%
friends of veterans and it was an
 
01:24:56.830 --> 01:24:56.840 align:start position:0%
awesome service but we do those pretty
 
01:24:59.870 --> 01:24:59.880 align:start position:0%
frequently regarding space we have
 
01:25:01.950 --> 01:25:01.960 align:start position:0%
plenty of room at least another 80 years
 
01:25:03.790 --> 01:25:03.800 align:start position:0%
of space we're actually currently
 
01:25:06.030 --> 01:25:06.040 align:start position:0%
starting in fact on the 29th of this
 
01:25:08.310 --> 01:25:08.320 align:start position:0%
month we will break ground a $5.3
 
01:25:10.870 --> 01:25:10.880 align:start position:0%
million expansion which will put in a
 
01:25:12.950 --> 01:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
little over 3200 columbarium Niche
 
01:25:15.350 --> 01:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
spaces and a little over 4200 inground
 
01:25:18.229 --> 01:25:18.239 align:start position:0%
cremation spaces we do about 80% of our
 
01:25:20.510 --> 01:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
burials are cremation burials we offer
 
01:25:23.030 --> 01:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
full casket inground cremation and
 
01:25:25.790 --> 01:25:25.800 align:start position:0%
columbarium Niche Wall burials um but
 
01:25:27.390 --> 01:25:27.400 align:start position:0%
about in New Hampshire it's about 80% it
 
01:25:28.590 --> 01:25:28.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter to us oh by the way
 
01:25:30.109 --> 01:25:30.119 align:start position:0%
there's no cost for a veteran to be
 
01:25:30.990 --> 01:25:31.000 align:start position:0%
buried at the New Hampshire State
 
01:25:32.550 --> 01:25:32.560 align:start position:0%
veteran SE it's a it's a benefit that
 
01:25:35.189 --> 01:25:35.199 align:start position:0%
they've earned so this $5.3 million
 
01:25:36.750 --> 01:25:36.760 align:start position:0%
expansion is starting it's paid for by
 
01:25:37.790 --> 01:25:37.800 align:start position:0%
the federal government through the
 
01:25:40.510 --> 01:25:40.520 align:start position:0%
Veteran Cemetery grants program um but
 
01:25:42.629 --> 01:25:42.639 align:start position:0%
yeah we have plenty of room we have uh
 
01:25:45.270 --> 01:25:45.280 align:start position:0%
60 acres of developable land and we've
 
01:25:48.310 --> 01:25:48.320 align:start position:0%
only developed about 19 so um and as and
 
01:25:50.510 --> 01:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
as long as the trend for cremation
 
01:25:52.669 --> 01:25:52.679 align:start position:0%
continues to go the direction it's about
 
01:25:54.750 --> 01:25:54.760 align:start position:0%
last year it's about 81%
 
01:25:56.470 --> 01:25:56.480 align:start position:0%
will last even longer than the 80 years
 
01:25:58.910 --> 01:25:58.920 align:start position:0%
that I projected out I would say we're
 
01:26:00.590 --> 01:26:00.600 align:start position:0%
probably good for another hundred years
 
01:26:00.600 --> 01:26:01.990 align:start position:0%
probably good for another hundred years
at

01:26:01.990 --> 01:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:26:04.189 --> 01:26:04.199 align:start position:0%
least well that's a comfort because I
 
01:26:06.629 --> 01:26:06.639 align:start position:0%
have a reservation there and I uh I I
 
01:26:08.790 --> 01:26:08.800 align:start position:0%
don't want to I don't want to I think it
 
01:26:10.669 --> 01:26:10.679 align:start position:0%
sounds like I'll be fine anything else
 
01:26:13.550 --> 01:26:13.560 align:start position:0%
for for Sean uh yes representative uh
 
01:26:13.560 --> 01:26:16.830 align:start position:0%
for for Sean uh yes representative uh
from

01:26:16.830 --> 01:26:16.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:20.750 --> 01:26:20.760 align:start position:0%
Manchester thank you Mr chairman uh just
 
01:26:24.390 --> 01:26:24.400 align:start position:0%

01:26:42.270 --> 01:26:42.280 align:start position:0%
years ago if I remember right we just we
 
01:26:45.510 --> 01:26:45.520 align:start position:0%
signed up online uh we sign in person we
 
01:26:47.109 --> 01:26:47.119 align:start position:0%
went there in person and signed up with
 
01:26:50.910 --> 01:26:50.920 align:start position:0%
my DD214 and all that and we decided to
 
01:26:53.870 --> 01:26:53.880 align:start position:0%
just walk around a little bit and just
 
01:26:53.880 --> 01:26:55.189 align:start position:0%
just walk around a little bit and just
and

01:26:55.189 --> 01:26:55.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:26:57.669 --> 01:26:57.679 align:start position:0%
if I remember correctly somebody kept
 
01:27:00.310 --> 01:27:00.320 align:start position:0%
their sense of humor to the very end on
 
01:27:04.030 --> 01:27:04.040 align:start position:0%
the little plate where there's right
 
01:27:06.990 --> 01:27:07.000 align:start position:0%
this it it's it's quoted as saying that
 
01:27:09.910 --> 01:27:09.920 align:start position:0%
the dying individuals said I told you I
 
01:27:12.830 --> 01:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
was sick and that
 
01:27:15.550 --> 01:27:15.560 align:start position:0%
was we both cracked up in the cemetery
 
01:27:17.830 --> 01:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
we just were laughing our heads off yeah
 
01:27:19.270 --> 01:27:19.280 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of those actually I walk
 
01:27:21.030 --> 01:27:21.040 align:start position:0%
around and read those quite a bit a
 
01:27:22.830 --> 01:27:22.840 align:start position:0%
couple things I'll encourage um first of
 
01:27:25.229 --> 01:27:25.239 align:start position:0%

01:27:39.310 --> 01:27:39.320 align:start position:0%
to their final salute and I'm sure
 
01:27:40.430 --> 01:27:40.440 align:start position:0%
she'll talk about I don't want to steal
 
01:27:43.149 --> 01:27:43.159 align:start position:0%

01:27:55.470 --> 01:27:55.480 align:start position:0%
come to a service also will be on time I
 
01:27:57.669 --> 01:27:57.679 align:start position:0%
was late for one just at the very end
 
01:27:59.669 --> 01:27:59.679 align:start position:0%
and they were all already doing Taps we
 
01:28:02.669 --> 01:28:02.679 align:start position:0%
run a military operation sir we start on
 
01:28:05.390 --> 01:28:05.400 align:start position:0%
time yes that is true people need to
 
01:28:08.990 --> 01:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
know that the uh Veteran Cemetery is on
 
01:28:11.510 --> 01:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
a schedule and they keep to it and that
 
01:28:14.990 --> 01:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
is impressive um and as I said before um
 
01:28:17.310 --> 01:28:17.320 align:start position:0%
there are there will be CU I check uh
 
01:28:19.229 --> 01:28:19.239 align:start position:0%
depends on what the bill is or whatever
 
01:28:20.510 --> 01:28:20.520 align:start position:0%
but there are always several hundred
 
01:28:23.350 --> 01:28:23.360 align:start position:0%
people who are watching or or you can on
 
01:28:26.350 --> 01:28:26.360 align:start position:0%

everybody when I talk about it I said
 
01:29:37.310 --> 01:29:37.320 align:start position:0%
it's like a mini Arlington you you'll
 
01:29:40.070 --> 01:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
never go to a place more hering than
 
01:29:43.830 --> 01:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
that place with a quick qu it's awesome
 
01:29:45.310 --> 01:29:45.320 align:start position:0%
quick question is could you tell us
 
01:29:47.149 --> 01:29:47.159 align:start position:0%
briefly a little bit about the memorial
 
01:29:47.159 --> 01:29:48.510 align:start position:0%
briefly a little bit about the memorial
walkway

01:29:48.510 --> 01:29:48.520 align:start position:0%
walkway
 
01:29:51.030 --> 01:29:51.040 align:start position:0%
so so the memorial walkway sponsored by
 
01:29:52.390 --> 01:29:52.400 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Veteran Cemetery
 
01:29:54.830 --> 01:29:54.840 align:start position:0%
Association so that's a 501 1c3 that
 
01:29:56.709 --> 01:29:56.719 align:start position:0%
raises money on behalf of the Veteran
 
01:30:00.189 --> 01:30:00.199 align:start position:0%
Cemetery and what it is it winds through
 
01:30:01.830 --> 01:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
the woods right there at the veteran
 
01:30:04.350 --> 01:30:04.360 align:start position:0%
Cemetary it is meant to honor veterans
 
01:30:08.430 --> 01:30:08.440 align:start position:0%
from various conflicts groups uh
 
01:30:11.189 --> 01:30:11.199 align:start position:0%
organizations and it uh it's all private
 
01:30:12.830 --> 01:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
it's all money that is raised privately
 
01:30:14.229 --> 01:30:14.239 align:start position:0%
it's either through donations to the
 
01:30:16.070 --> 01:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
association or through other private
 
01:30:18.229 --> 01:30:18.239 align:start position:0%
means uh The Monuments are built and
 
01:30:20.790 --> 01:30:20.800 align:start position:0%
then donated to the state um so that the
 
01:30:22.790 --> 01:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
monuments then become State Property so
 
01:30:24.910 --> 01:30:24.920 align:start position:0%
it's just a uh
 
01:30:26.189 --> 01:30:26.199 align:start position:0%
you have to come check it out I mean
 
01:30:27.510 --> 01:30:27.520 align:start position:0%
it's hard to it's hard to explain it's
 
01:30:29.990 --> 01:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
over a lot of benches and it's got a the
 
01:30:32.830 --> 01:30:32.840 align:start position:0%
Air Force Monument for example is a 17th
 
01:30:36.430 --> 01:30:36.440 align:start position:0%
uh replica of what's at the Pentagon uh
 
01:30:37.830 --> 01:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
there's an army Monument that's got
 
01:30:39.590 --> 01:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
pictures of New Hampshire veterans it's
 
01:30:42.109 --> 01:30:42.119 align:start position:0%
just uh it's awesome and and thank you
 
01:30:43.669 --> 01:30:43.679 align:start position:0%
for all the great comments we really are
 
01:30:43.679 --> 01:30:45.470 align:start position:0%
for all the great comments we really are
we're

01:30:45.470 --> 01:30:45.480 align:start position:0%
we're
 
01:30:47.910 --> 01:30:47.920 align:start position:0%
grateful represent
 
01:30:50.030 --> 01:30:50.040 align:start position:0%
Jones Thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:30:53.030 --> 01:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
for being here um just a quick question
 
01:30:55.910 --> 01:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
do you honor family special requests or
 
01:30:57.830 --> 01:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
uh religious traditions for instance if
 
01:30:59.870 --> 01:30:59.880 align:start position:0%
somebody didn't want to use a
 
01:30:59.880 --> 01:31:01.430 align:start position:0%
somebody didn't want to use a
vault

01:31:01.430 --> 01:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
vault
 
01:31:05.590 --> 01:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
or we all we stay within the confines of
 
01:31:07.390 --> 01:31:07.400 align:start position:0%
the rules and regulations but we always
 
01:31:09.830 --> 01:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
do our best to honor so for example we
 
01:31:15.270 --> 01:31:15.280 align:start position:0%
had a a Muslim burial and they um they
 
01:31:16.750 --> 01:31:16.760 align:start position:0%
they require specific things with the
 
01:31:19.070 --> 01:31:19.080 align:start position:0%
Imam and we did honor that so for
 
01:31:22.590 --> 01:31:22.600 align:start position:0%
example with the Vault for some Jew in
 
01:31:23.990 --> 01:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
the Jewish faith as well as the the
 
01:31:25.990 --> 01:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
Muslim faith the the remains have to be
 
01:31:29.189 --> 01:31:29.199 align:start position:0%
on the ground um not on the concrete of
 
01:31:32.590 --> 01:31:32.600 align:start position:0%
a vault and we do allow for that um we
 
01:31:34.030 --> 01:31:34.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes will the Vault will be turned
 
01:31:35.590 --> 01:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
upside down so the remains are on the
 
01:31:37.430 --> 01:31:37.440 align:start position:0%
ground and then the Vault so we don't
 
01:31:40.070 --> 01:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
allow for the remains to not be covered
 
01:31:42.390 --> 01:31:42.400 align:start position:0%
but we do make compromises to allow for
 
01:31:44.310 --> 01:31:44.320 align:start position:0%
them so for example in the Jewish face
 
01:31:46.149 --> 01:31:46.159 align:start position:0%
sometimes they'll go to the pre-placed
 
01:31:48.070 --> 01:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
vaults and we'll put dirt on the ground
 
01:31:50.070 --> 01:31:50.080 align:start position:0%
inside the Vault some for some of them
 
01:31:52.709 --> 01:31:52.719 align:start position:0%
that suffices um but to answer your
 
01:31:55.550 --> 01:31:55.560 align:start position:0%
question we will do what we can to honor
 
01:31:58.870 --> 01:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
that veteran to their religious
 
01:32:01.149 --> 01:32:01.159 align:start position:0%
Traditions thank you very
 
01:32:06.310 --> 01:32:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:09.270 --> 01:32:09.280 align:start position:0%

01:32:10.590 --> 01:32:10.600 align:start position:0%

01:35:02.950 --> 01:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
stakeholder to show up to meetings and
 
01:35:05.430 --> 01:35:05.440 align:start position:0%
and most of a lot of them do uh our
 
01:35:07.109 --> 01:35:07.119 align:start position:0%
primary focus is to provide a common
 
01:35:09.390 --> 01:35:09.400 align:start position:0%
voice for the 90 plus thousand uh New
 
01:35:11.910 --> 01:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire veterans and their families um
 
01:35:13.790 --> 01:35:13.800 align:start position:0%
I usually tell people on the coordinator
 
01:35:15.590 --> 01:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
opinions I'm not really the opinion
 
01:35:17.470 --> 01:35:17.480 align:start position:0%
Setter but I coordinate the opinions of
 
01:35:19.070 --> 01:35:19.080 align:start position:0%
all the veteran service organizations so
 
01:35:21.590 --> 01:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
we're all on the same page um we our
 
01:35:24.030 --> 01:35:24.040 align:start position:0%
primary focus is legislation especially
 
01:35:25.709 --> 01:35:25.719 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire we highly
 
01:35:27.830 --> 01:35:27.840 align:start position:0%
encourage you to reach out to us for
 
01:35:29.629 --> 01:35:29.639 align:start position:0%
proper nomenclature is a big a big deal
 
01:35:31.990 --> 01:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
but legislation or even policy changes
 
01:35:33.830 --> 01:35:33.840 align:start position:0%
we give veteran Healthcare updates and
 
01:35:35.990 --> 01:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
we schedule events uh and we brief on
 
01:35:38.910 --> 01:35:38.920 align:start position:0%

things that they're doing at the federal
 
01:36:34.910 --> 01:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
level which gives us a good Avenue um to
 
01:36:37.950 --> 01:36:37.960 align:start position:0%
Congress um which works out pretty good
 
01:36:40.109 --> 01:36:40.119 align:start position:0%
um we continue to work with the members
 
01:36:42.229 --> 01:36:42.239 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire State uh state house
 
01:36:44.990 --> 01:36:45.000 align:start position:0%

01:36:48.590 --> 01:36:48.600 align:start position:0%
legislative action on behalf of the
 
01:36:51.709 --> 01:36:51.719 align:start position:0%
veterans again we I coordinate the
 
01:36:52.950 --> 01:36:52.960 align:start position:0%
opinions a lot of times we do
 
01:36:54.310 --> 01:36:54.320 align:start position:0%
legislative stuff this healthy
 
01:36:56.270 --> 01:36:56.280 align:start position:0%
discussion usually it's about an
 
01:36:59.229 --> 01:36:59.239 align:start position:0%
unanimous whether we support um uh
 
01:37:02.950 --> 01:37:02.960 align:start position:0%
follow or um oppose a bill um but a lot
 
01:37:04.669 --> 01:37:04.679 align:start position:0%
of discussion good discussion it's all
 
01:37:06.350 --> 01:37:06.360 align:start position:0%
technical not emotional so that works
 
01:37:07.550 --> 01:37:07.560 align:start position:0%
out pretty of course there is some
 
01:37:08.830 --> 01:37:08.840 align:start position:0%
emotional discussion because you can't
 
01:37:11.390 --> 01:37:11.400 align:start position:0%
have a a quorum without that but uh
 
01:37:14.109 --> 01:37:14.119 align:start position:0%
mostly it's a technical uh we highly
 
01:37:17.470 --> 01:37:17.480 align:start position:0%
encourage uh uh to swing by and have
 
01:37:18.950 --> 01:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
this review Bill language that's what
 
01:37:21.830 --> 01:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
Kevin excellent at um during the filing
 
01:37:24.149 --> 01:37:24.159 align:start position:0%
period like uh you represented of Mafia
 
01:37:25.790 --> 01:37:25.800 align:start position:0%
had mentioned something about the 100%
 
01:37:28.990 --> 01:37:29.000 align:start position:0%
veteran cuz the 100% disabled veteran
 
01:37:30.990 --> 01:37:31.000 align:start position:0%
they're not the same as they totally
 
01:37:32.990 --> 01:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
disab if if you're gainfully employable
 
01:37:35.870 --> 01:37:35.880 align:start position:0%
at 100% rating doesn't mean that you're
 
01:37:37.550 --> 01:37:37.560 align:start position:0%
the same thing as a 100% veteran who
 
01:37:38.990 --> 01:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
can't you know had a traumatic brain
 
01:37:42.310 --> 01:37:42.320 align:start position:0%
injury or something it can't work um
 
01:37:43.629 --> 01:37:43.639 align:start position:0%
hopefully we can avoid unintended
 
01:37:45.189 --> 01:37:45.199 align:start position:0%
consequences because everything that
 
01:37:46.669 --> 01:37:46.679 align:start position:0%
happens in the world has a cause and
 
01:37:48.790 --> 01:37:48.800 align:start position:0%
effect so sometimes the spirit of the
 
01:37:52.270 --> 01:37:52.280 align:start position:0%
bills always seem very good um sometimes
 
01:37:53.750 --> 01:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
the nomeclature inside there are the
 
01:37:55.149 --> 01:37:55.159 align:start position:0%
definitions just need a little bit of
 
01:37:57.870 --> 01:37:57.880 align:start position:0%
help so that's why we're here um
 
01:37:59.830 --> 01:37:59.840 align:start position:0%
committee we encourage all invitees and
 
01:38:01.310 --> 01:38:01.320 align:start position:0%
legislators especially the prime
 
01:38:03.430 --> 01:38:03.440 align:start position:0%
sponsors any veteran related Bill to
 
01:38:05.149 --> 01:38:05.159 align:start position:0%
participate and exchange views with the
 
01:38:07.109 --> 01:38:07.119 align:start position:0%
members of the svac and uh developing
 
01:38:09.270 --> 01:38:09.280 align:start position:0%
positions on matters important to those
 
01:38:10.950 --> 01:38:10.960 align:start position:0%
veterans sorry to read to you but I
 
01:38:12.430 --> 01:38:12.440 align:start position:0%
forget what I'm going to say if I don't
 
01:38:17.109 --> 01:38:17.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:19.470 --> 01:38:19.480 align:start position:0%
you okay I'll jump in with with my
 
01:38:21.510 --> 01:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
portion here uh a little bit a little
 
01:38:24.790 --> 01:38:24.800 align:start position:0%
bit about me uh uh like Colonel just
 
01:38:26.470 --> 01:38:26.480 align:start position:0%
like Bixler I'm I'm also an Air Force
 
01:38:28.310 --> 01:38:28.320 align:start position:0%
Academy grad looking forward to going
 
01:38:30.910 --> 01:38:30.920 align:start position:0%
back this fall uh to my 50th year
 
01:38:33.430 --> 01:38:33.440 align:start position:0%
reunion uh to see a bunch of people that
 
01:38:36.589 --> 01:38:36.599 align:start position:0%
I've I've known my whole life and uh
 
01:38:37.830 --> 01:38:37.840 align:start position:0%
spent most of my time in the Air Force
 
01:38:40.430 --> 01:38:40.440 align:start position:0%
as a fighter pilot flying the F-15 see I
 
01:38:42.109 --> 01:38:42.119 align:start position:0%
did have one tour for two years eight
 
01:38:44.270 --> 01:38:44.280 align:start position:0%
months and 17 days with the US Army at
 
01:38:46.510 --> 01:38:46.520 align:start position:0%
Fort Hood Texas working with the first
 
01:38:50.030 --> 01:38:50.040 align:start position:0%
Cavalry division um and I spent my last
 
01:38:51.790 --> 01:38:51.800 align:start position:0%
assignment in the Air Force sitting on a
 
01:38:54.709 --> 01:38:54.719 align:start position:0%
big on a staff on a big steel desk in in
 
01:38:56.750 --> 01:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
Ramstein Germany and if you want to ask
 
01:38:58.350 --> 01:38:58.360 align:start position:0%
a fighter pilot to sit behind a desk the
 
01:38:59.750 --> 01:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
only thing that matters is the location
 
01:39:01.910 --> 01:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
of the desk okay I'd rather be the snow
 
01:39:03.629 --> 01:39:03.639 align:start position:0%
removal officer in Europe than the chief
 
01:39:07.189 --> 01:39:07.199 align:start position:0%
of staff and the Pentagon um so I I when
 
01:39:08.550 --> 01:39:08.560 align:start position:0%
I retired from the Air Force I actually
 
01:39:11.229 --> 01:39:11.239 align:start position:0%
flew uh 737s for United for about five
 
01:39:12.830 --> 01:39:12.840 align:start position:0%
and a half years got tired of being gone
 
01:39:14.870 --> 01:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
all the time so I started up The Air
 
01:39:17.189 --> 01:39:17.199 align:start position:0%
Force Junior RC program down at alurn
 
01:39:19.910 --> 01:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
high school and I taught there for 11
 
01:39:21.950 --> 01:39:21.960 align:start position:0%
years and finally retired in 2014 and
 
01:39:24.669 --> 01:39:24.679 align:start position:0%
I'm failing miserably at retiring okay
 
01:39:26.750 --> 01:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
the the cautionary tale for retirement
 
01:39:29.550 --> 01:39:29.560 align:start position:0%
is is that work does expand to fill the
 
01:39:31.149 --> 01:39:31.159 align:start position:0%
time allotted for it it's one of those
 
01:39:34.470 --> 01:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
Murphy's Law Coral are so um one of the
 
01:39:36.790 --> 01:39:36.800 align:start position:0%
things I do and I literally inherited
 
01:39:38.790 --> 01:39:38.800 align:start position:0%
this job when the guy before me passed
 
01:39:41.189 --> 01:39:41.199 align:start position:0%
away the guy before me was from my
 
01:39:43.669 --> 01:39:43.679 align:start position:0%
organization uh the air force uh now the
 
01:39:45.870 --> 01:39:45.880 align:start position:0%
air and space forces Association a guy
 
01:39:47.950 --> 01:39:47.960 align:start position:0%
named ed Josephson and some of you maybe
 
01:39:49.790 --> 01:39:49.800 align:start position:0%
have been around a little while might
 
01:39:51.430 --> 01:39:51.440 align:start position:0%
remember Ed Ed was one of the original
 
01:39:54.030 --> 01:39:54.040 align:start position:0%
class of 1959 grads was really
 
01:39:55.189 --> 01:39:55.199 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable about this and when he
 
01:39:58.149 --> 01:39:58.159 align:start position:0%
passed away in 2016 they said would you
 
01:39:59.830 --> 01:39:59.840 align:start position:0%
take on this legislative thing and I
 
01:40:01.669 --> 01:40:01.679 align:start position:0%
said well okay I'll do that and I've
 
01:40:03.149 --> 01:40:03.159 align:start position:0%
been I've been doing it ever since this
 
01:40:05.470 --> 01:40:05.480 align:start position:0%
is my ninth uh session rolling through
 
01:40:09.870 --> 01:40:09.880 align:start position:0%
here um we have uh 17 bills that we're
 
01:40:11.870 --> 01:40:11.880 align:start position:0%
following this this go around that have
 
01:40:13.589 --> 01:40:13.599 align:start position:0%
some measure of Veteran impact some of
 
01:40:16.390 --> 01:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
it's kind of obscure like we look at
 
01:40:19.589 --> 01:40:19.599 align:start position:0%
like a there's a a licensed dietician
 
01:40:21.750 --> 01:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
comp compact but there's a little
 
01:40:24.149 --> 01:40:24.159 align:start position:0%
section in there that says you know that
 
01:40:25.589 --> 01:40:25.599 align:start position:0%
applies to Military and applies to
 
01:40:28.189 --> 01:40:28.199 align:start position:0%
military spouses so we're you know we're
 
01:40:31.470 --> 01:40:31.480 align:start position:0%
going to go uh testify on that one of
 
01:40:32.830 --> 01:40:32.840 align:start position:0%
the things that I've always tried to
 
01:40:35.430 --> 01:40:35.440 align:start position:0%
tell people when I when I testify is
 
01:40:37.950 --> 01:40:37.960 align:start position:0%
that number one I represent 20
 
01:40:40.550 --> 01:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
organizations okay and and sometimes
 
01:40:42.629 --> 01:40:42.639 align:start position:0%
what I tell you is not necessarily my
 
01:40:44.589 --> 01:40:44.599 align:start position:0%
personal opinion but it's their opinion
 
01:40:46.629 --> 01:40:46.639 align:start position:0%
and I think that's what you need to know
 
01:40:49.109 --> 01:40:49.119 align:start position:0%
is it's their opinion and I also tell
 
01:40:51.669 --> 01:40:51.679 align:start position:0%
them that and and and general molus
 
01:40:53.790 --> 01:40:53.800 align:start position:0%
alluded to this a little bit earlier
 
01:40:56.270 --> 01:40:56.280 align:start position:0%
you know we believe that when one of us
 
01:40:58.589 --> 01:40:58.599 align:start position:0%
serves the whole family serves so things
 
01:41:00.390 --> 01:41:00.400 align:start position:0%
that we can do for spouses and families
 
01:41:02.790 --> 01:41:02.800 align:start position:0%
we are all over trying to help out with
 
01:41:04.950 --> 01:41:04.960 align:start position:0%
with those kinds of things and the last
 
01:41:07.990 --> 01:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
thing is I can't be in a position where
 
01:41:10.109 --> 01:41:10.119 align:start position:0%
every time that I see you I've got my
 
01:41:12.910 --> 01:41:12.920 align:start position:0%
hand out looking for money okay we are
 
01:41:15.149 --> 01:41:15.159 align:start position:0%
taxpayers too we have to be cognizant of
 
01:41:17.189 --> 01:41:17.199 align:start position:0%
the fact that every time you give a tax
 
01:41:19.430 --> 01:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
break to a veteran somebody else has to
 
01:41:21.910 --> 01:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
make up the slack for that in the in the
 
01:41:24.629 --> 01:41:24.639 align:start position:0%
community Okay so we we pick and choose
 
01:41:26.430 --> 01:41:26.440 align:start position:0%
this very carefully and sometimes you
 
01:41:29.030 --> 01:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
look and we might oppose like a property
 
01:41:31.910 --> 01:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
tax increase we might oppose that by
 
01:41:35.669 --> 01:41:35.679 align:start position:0%
just saying you know we're we're our our
 
01:41:37.109 --> 01:41:37.119 align:start position:0%
civilian counterparts are already paying
 
01:41:38.629 --> 01:41:38.639 align:start position:0%
their fair share all right let's let's
 
01:41:42.510 --> 01:41:42.520 align:start position:0%
try and keep this uh uh reel here uh the
 
01:41:43.990 --> 01:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
last thing that I'll tell you is we I've
 
01:41:45.709 --> 01:41:45.719 align:start position:0%
been involved in this for a while and
 
01:41:47.629 --> 01:41:47.639 align:start position:0%
and one of the real success stories we
 
01:41:49.030 --> 01:41:49.040 align:start position:0%
have and I I want to just tell you the
 
01:41:50.470 --> 01:41:50.480 align:start position:0%
story because you probably wouldn't hear
 
01:41:53.790 --> 01:41:53.800 align:start position:0%
it any other place um when Governor
 
01:41:56.830 --> 01:41:56.840 align:start position:0%
sonunu first became the governor uh he
 
01:41:59.709 --> 01:41:59.719 align:start position:0%
came and and and visited one of our svac
 
01:42:01.750 --> 01:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
meetings and talked to some folks and at
 
01:42:03.310 --> 01:42:03.320 align:start position:0%
the end of it he posed a question that
 
01:42:05.870 --> 01:42:05.880 align:start position:0%
we could not answer and that question
 
01:42:10.229 --> 01:42:10.239 align:start position:0%
was if I have a veteran who has an issue
 
01:42:11.430 --> 01:42:11.440 align:start position:0%
where do I send
 
01:42:13.510 --> 01:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
him and we all looked around at each
 
01:42:14.790 --> 01:42:14.800 align:start position:0%
other and went well you know the answer
 
01:42:17.510 --> 01:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
is probably in this room somewhere but
 
01:42:20.550 --> 01:42:20.560 align:start position:0%
you know there's not one single agency
 
01:42:22.189 --> 01:42:22.199 align:start position:0%
and that's why we have the department of
 
01:42:24.350 --> 01:42:24.360 align:start position:0%
military Affairs and vet services today
 
01:42:26.270 --> 01:42:26.280 align:start position:0%
we started the legislative process we
 
01:42:28.589 --> 01:42:28.599 align:start position:0%
had a guy some of you may remember named
 
01:42:30.990 --> 01:42:31.000 align:start position:0%
Al Bal balero that worked this problem
 
01:42:34.910 --> 01:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
very hard uh we had to get past the uh
 
01:42:37.070 --> 01:42:37.080 align:start position:0%
uh the previous chair of this committee
 
01:42:41.510 --> 01:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh Colonel Russ over um you know he he
 
01:42:43.189 --> 01:42:43.199 align:start position:0%
had specific feelings about how this
 
01:42:44.669 --> 01:42:44.679 align:start position:0%
needed to go but what we have now we
 
01:42:46.830 --> 01:42:46.840 align:start position:0%
think is great but you will see things
 
01:42:51.189 --> 01:42:51.199 align:start position:0%
like for example House Bill 120 uh
 
01:42:53.189 --> 01:42:53.199 align:start position:0%
transferring to statute author uh and
 
01:42:55.350 --> 01:42:55.360 align:start position:0%
will hear this bill in this committee
 
01:42:57.990 --> 01:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
the statutory Authority from uh
 
01:42:59.350 --> 01:42:59.360 align:start position:0%
Department of Education to the
 
01:43:00.510 --> 01:43:00.520 align:start position:0%
Department of military Affairs and
 
01:43:03.189 --> 01:43:03.199 align:start position:0%
veteran services for uh dependent
 
01:43:04.950 --> 01:43:04.960 align:start position:0%
children educational support issues
 
01:43:07.189 --> 01:43:07.199 align:start position:0%
those kind of things what these are
 
01:43:08.669 --> 01:43:08.679 align:start position:0%
you'll see some of these in the next
 
01:43:11.030 --> 01:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
session or two we're cleaning up trying
 
01:43:12.910 --> 01:43:12.920 align:start position:0%
to still find those places out there
 
01:43:16.229 --> 01:43:16.239 align:start position:0%
that belong under dmabs that that aren't
 
01:43:18.149 --> 01:43:18.159 align:start position:0%
there yet and we want to we want to get
 
01:43:20.550 --> 01:43:20.560 align:start position:0%
them there okay so you you'll see that

code that I can perhaps look at how do I
 
01:50:39.430 --> 01:50:39.440 align:start position:0%
follow and track and understand and have
 
01:50:41.750 --> 01:50:41.760 align:start position:0%

uh while I had uh planned on talking
 
01:51:04.589 --> 01:51:04.599 align:start position:0%
about some uh in more detail uh they are
 
01:51:06.910 --> 01:51:06.920 align:start position:0%
outlined uh in in the folder that you
 
01:51:09.149 --> 01:51:09.159 align:start position:0%

01:51:18.229 --> 01:51:18.239 align:start position:0%
questions that you might have prepared
 
01:51:20.470 --> 01:51:20.480 align:start position:0%

um this came across my desk yesterday
 
01:57:19.350 --> 01:57:19.360 align:start position:0%
it's a testimonial from a a daughter and
 
01:57:21.149 --> 01:57:21.159 align:start position:0%
so if I could take two minutes and share
 
01:57:22.750 --> 01:57:22.760 align:start position:0%
this with you all
 
01:57:26.830 --> 01:57:26.840 align:start position:0%
was worth it so um my name is Lori my

father is an 88-year-old veteran I
 
01:57:30.750 --> 01:57:30.760 align:start position:0%
recently had the honor of accompanying
 
01:57:32.669 --> 01:57:32.679 align:start position:0%
my father to the VA Manchester Medical
 
01:57:34.790 --> 01:57:34.800 align:start position:0%
Center he had been bragging about the
 
01:57:36.390 --> 01:57:36.400 align:start position:0%
wonderful people and the services at the
 
01:57:38.830 --> 01:57:38.840 align:start position:0%
VA I had to see it for myself to be a
 
01:57:40.350 --> 01:57:40.360 align:start position:0%
second set of ears when speaking with
 
01:57:42.910 --> 01:57:42.920 align:start position:0%
the doctors and nurses so I went with
 
01:57:44.310 --> 01:57:44.320 align:start position:0%
him for the first time this past
 
01:57:46.430 --> 01:57:46.440 align:start position:0%
November it became apparent to me the
 
01:57:48.030 --> 01:57:48.040 align:start position:0%
minute we entered the VA that it was a
 
01:57:50.510 --> 01:57:50.520 align:start position:0%
very special place when I first arrived
 
01:57:52.310 --> 01:57:52.320 align:start position:0%
my dad was already in a wheelchair with
 
01:57:54.030 --> 01:57:54.040 align:start position:0%
a very kind gentleman waiting to take
 
01:57:56.270 --> 01:57:56.280 align:start position:0%
him anywhere he needed to go the people
 
01:57:58.109 --> 01:57:58.119 align:start position:0%
at the information booth greeted us and
 
01:57:58.119 --> 01:57:59.149 align:start position:0%
at the information booth greeted us and
smiled

01:57:59.149 --> 01:57:59.159 align:start position:0%
smiled
 
01:58:01.270 --> 01:58:01.280 align:start position:0%
brightly on this visit my father was
 
01:58:03.390 --> 01:58:03.400 align:start position:0%
meeting his primary care doctor for the
 
01:58:05.270 --> 01:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
first time to check in with him after
 
01:58:06.830 --> 01:58:06.840 align:start position:0%
having been in the hospital for a few
 
01:58:08.950 --> 01:58:08.960 align:start position:0%
days we first met with Jacqueline
 
01:58:11.510 --> 01:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
Blackman RN she was professional but
 
01:58:14.109 --> 01:58:14.119 align:start position:0%
also very kind listened intently to his
 
01:58:15.910 --> 01:58:15.920 align:start position:0%
stories which I believed he had told her
 
01:58:18.910 --> 01:58:18.920 align:start position:0%
before and made my made me feel that I
 
01:58:20.669 --> 01:58:20.679 align:start position:0%
should be there and was pleased I was
 
01:58:23.189 --> 01:58:23.199 align:start position:0%
getting involved in my Dad's health care
 
01:58:24.589 --> 01:58:24.599 align:start position:0%
we were then introduced to his new
 
01:58:27.910 --> 01:58:27.920 align:start position:0%
doctor Dr Martina derva I was blown away
 
01:58:29.350 --> 01:58:29.360 align:start position:0%
when she talked about her credentials
 
01:58:31.510 --> 01:58:31.520 align:start position:0%
and did her very best to sell herself to
 
01:58:34.069 --> 01:58:34.079 align:start position:0%
us most doctors that I have dealt with
 
01:58:35.830 --> 01:58:35.840 align:start position:0%
have made me feel as if I am lucky that
 
01:58:38.750 --> 01:58:38.760 align:start position:0%
they were willing to take me on as a
 
01:58:41.510 --> 01:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
patient this was a wonderful change she
 
01:58:43.030 --> 01:58:43.040 align:start position:0%
then went through his medical records
 
01:58:45.149 --> 01:58:45.159 align:start position:0%
discerned how he has been doing now and
 
01:58:47.390 --> 01:58:47.400 align:start position:0%
what needed to be done next she made
 
01:58:49.149 --> 01:58:49.159 align:start position:0%
sure that all of his and my questions
 
01:58:51.390 --> 01:58:51.400 align:start position:0%
were answered we never felt rushed or
 
01:58:53.830 --> 01:58:53.840 align:start position:0%
that we were number I have never been so
 
01:58:56.310 --> 01:58:56.320 align:start position:0%
impressed all my fears for my father's
 
01:58:59.109 --> 01:58:59.119 align:start position:0%
healthc care vanished that day at
 
01:59:00.830 --> 01:59:00.840 align:start position:0%
another appointment this week we again
 
01:59:02.830 --> 01:59:02.840 align:start position:0%
meet with many Fantastic employees of
 
01:59:05.430 --> 01:59:05.440 align:start position:0%
this VA one of them was nurse Lauren
 
01:59:08.069 --> 01:59:08.079 align:start position:0%
Crowley LPN just like Miss Blackman she
 
01:59:10.510 --> 01:59:10.520 align:start position:0%
was professional very kind and very
 
01:59:12.470 --> 01:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
understanding obviously this is not the
 
01:59:15.030 --> 01:59:15.040 align:start position:0%
norm for this facility this is the norm
 
01:59:17.550 --> 01:59:17.560 align:start position:0%
for this facility not a rarity every
 
01:59:18.950 --> 01:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
single person we encountered throughout
 
01:59:21.030 --> 01:59:21.040 align:start position:0%
the VA was a pleasure to talk to
 
01:59:22.669 --> 01:59:22.679 align:start position:0%
everyone from the minute you Walkin the
 
01:59:24.629 --> 01:59:24.639 align:start position:0%
check-in and out Ladies as well as the
 
01:59:26.669 --> 01:59:26.679 align:start position:0%
volunteers have been wonderful and on
 
01:59:28.189 --> 01:59:28.199 align:start position:0%
one visit we got turned around and got
 
01:59:29.750 --> 01:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
lost but we met a gentleman in the
 
01:59:31.390 --> 01:59:31.400 align:start position:0%
hallway who worked there but was not
 
01:59:33.229 --> 01:59:33.239 align:start position:0%
part of the medical team and he couldn't
 
01:59:34.629 --> 01:59:34.639 align:start position:0%
do enough to help us find where we
 
01:59:36.669 --> 01:59:36.679 align:start position:0%
needed to go you don't find that
 
01:59:38.830 --> 01:59:38.840 align:start position:0%
everywhere my father loves to laugh and
 
01:59:41.830 --> 01:59:41.840 align:start position:0%
he does that a lot when we are
 
01:59:41.840 --> 01:59:43.629 align:start position:0%
he does that a lot when we are
here

01:59:43.629 --> 01:59:43.639 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:59:46.990 --> 01:59:47.000 align:start position:0%

02:02:08.790 --> 02:02:08.800 align:start position:0%
Specialty Care providers that are you

Hampshire um medical medical areas that
 
02:02:16.629 --> 02:02:16.639 align:start position:0%
um you just don't have uh all in the
 
02:02:18.149 --> 02:02:18.159 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire but we're able to
 
02:02:20.350 --> 02:02:20.360 align:start position:0%
access them through our Integrated
 
02:02:23.910 --> 02:02:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:26.870 --> 02:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
the vision uh uh vision statement is to

serve I included our uh permanent
 
02:02:42.149 --> 02:02:42.159 align:start position:0%
leadership team uh many of you have uh
 
02:02:44.589 --> 02:02:44.599 align:start position:0%
worked with Mr Kevin Forest a veteran
 
02:02:46.669 --> 02:02:46.679 align:start position:0%

Jennifer Winslow is our nurse executive
 
02:03:02.709 --> 02:03:02.719 align:start position:0%
she has been um within the VA system for
 
02:03:05.109 --> 02:03:05.119 align:start position:0%
uh with with some longevity as well um
 
02:03:07.589 --> 02:03:07.599 align:start position:0%
maybe 12 or plus years pre previously
 
02:03:10.390 --> 02:03:10.400 align:start position:0%
our patient safety manager and last but
 
02:03:12.189 --> 02:03:12.199 align:start position:0%
not least we have our chief of quality
 
02:03:16.109 --> 02:03:16.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:19.470 --> 02:03:19.480 align:start position:0%
Goodrich we really try to instill our
 
02:03:22.109 --> 02:03:22.119 align:start position:0%
expectations for um great customer
 
02:03:24.030 --> 02:03:24.040 align:start position:0%
service at the onset of all of our new
 
02:03:27.470 --> 02:03:27.480 align:start position:0%
employees as they Orient in in um
 
02:03:29.550 --> 02:03:29.560 align:start position:0%
onboarding um and really we share what
 
02:03:32.310 --> 02:03:32.320 align:start position:0%
our intent is as a leadership team and
 
02:03:35.910 --> 02:03:35.920 align:start position:0%
that is to do the simple things well um
 
02:03:38.109 --> 02:03:38.119 align:start position:0%
you know in a government agency of
 
02:03:39.629 --> 02:03:39.639 align:start position:0%
course we're going to follow the rules
 
02:03:41.910 --> 02:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
but we're going to also um make
 
02:03:44.229 --> 02:03:44.239 align:start position:0%
decisions that make sense for the
 
02:03:47.149 --> 02:03:47.159 align:start position:0%
patient um and take care of each other
 
02:03:49.270 --> 02:03:49.280 align:start position:0%
take care of them um and just
 
02:03:52.390 --> 02:03:52.400 align:start position:0%
communicate in many different um many
 
02:03:54.830 --> 02:03:54.840 align:start position:0%
different forms because communication is
 
02:03:59.030 --> 02:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
uh just key for um uh running a Health
 
02:04:02.470 --> 02:04:02.480 align:start position:0%
Care system that is of um uh high
 
02:04:02.480 --> 02:04:04.589 align:start position:0%
Care system that is of um uh high
quality

02:04:04.589 --> 02:04:04.599 align:start position:0%
quality
 
02:04:08.669 --> 02:04:08.679 align:start position:0%
so our values and uh philosophy we we
 
02:04:11.189 --> 02:04:11.199 align:start position:0%
call them the ey care values Integrity
 
02:04:13.350 --> 02:04:13.360 align:start position:0%
commitment advocacy respect and
 
02:04:16.870 --> 02:04:16.880 align:start position:0%
Excellence uh all of our staff if you uh
 
02:04:18.310 --> 02:04:18.320 align:start position:0%
run into them in the hallway can
 
02:04:20.990 --> 02:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
probably tell you about these um we we
 
02:04:22.830 --> 02:04:22.840 align:start position:0%
really empower our staff to make
 
02:04:25.549 --> 02:04:25.559 align:start position:0%
decisions at the Frontline level and and
 
02:04:27.510 --> 02:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
tell them if you're if you feel that you
 
02:04:29.109 --> 02:04:29.119 align:start position:0%
need to follow your gut and your gut is
 
02:04:31.830 --> 02:04:31.840 align:start position:0%
in alignment with these values there are
 
02:04:33.870 --> 02:04:33.880 align:start position:0%
there are rarely times you will go wrong
 
02:04:36.390 --> 02:04:36.400 align:start position:0%
so um we really we talk about ey care
 
02:04:39.390 --> 02:04:39.400 align:start position:0%
values a lot in our um leadership um
 
02:04:42.229 --> 02:04:42.239 align:start position:0%
meetings and and working with
 
02:04:44.990 --> 02:04:45.000 align:start position:0%
staff on the location section for those
 
02:04:46.790 --> 02:04:46.800 align:start position:0%
of you who aren't familiar with all the
 
02:04:48.510 --> 02:04:48.520 align:start position:0%
different sites where we provide care in
 
02:04:50.709 --> 02:04:50.719 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so in Manchester we
 
02:04:52.669 --> 02:04:52.679 align:start position:0%
actually have two Loc s the main
 
02:04:54.750 --> 02:04:54.760 align:start position:0%
location that most are most familiar
 
02:04:57.189 --> 02:04:57.199 align:start position:0%
with um the main campus although it's
 
02:04:59.069 --> 02:04:59.079 align:start position:0%
looking different these days we've had
 
02:05:01.669 --> 02:05:01.679 align:start position:0%
over the past 5 years new additions and
 
02:05:03.669 --> 02:05:03.679 align:start position:0%
um taken down older buildings to get
 
02:05:05.910 --> 02:05:05.920 align:start position:0%
ready for more new additions and more
 
02:05:09.030 --> 02:05:09.040 align:start position:0%
parking um but second to that we also
 
02:05:10.310 --> 02:05:10.320 align:start position:0%
have what we're calling the Manchester
 
02:05:12.589 --> 02:05:12.599 align:start position:0%
West VA Clinic which has a wellness
 
02:05:15.510 --> 02:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
center for veterans um housed within it
 
02:05:17.870 --> 02:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
uh the Manchester VA West uh
 
02:05:20.510 --> 02:05:20.520 align:start position:0%
administrative spaces um really support
 
02:05:23.149 --> 02:05:23.159 align:start position:0%
a lot of our admin of departments that
 
02:05:25.189 --> 02:05:25.199 align:start position:0%
do not provide direct clinical care so
 
02:05:27.870 --> 02:05:27.880 align:start position:0%
that we have um appropriate space to
 
02:05:29.709 --> 02:05:29.719 align:start position:0%
provide that clinical care uh up the
 
02:05:32.669 --> 02:05:32.679 align:start position:0%
road at the main campus uh within the uh
 
02:05:34.350 --> 02:05:34.360 align:start position:0%
Whole Health Center and Wellness Center
 
02:05:37.270 --> 02:05:37.280 align:start position:0%
at Manchester West there's a veteran gym
 
02:05:39.030 --> 02:05:39.040 align:start position:0%
uh there are whole health coaches that
 
02:05:40.910 --> 02:05:40.920 align:start position:0%
provide Health coaching for um
 
02:05:43.510 --> 02:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
preventative U medicine and we also have
 
02:05:45.750 --> 02:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
mental health services down there so um
 
02:05:47.149 --> 02:05:47.159 align:start position:0%
it's a great new addition we broke the
 
02:05:53.790 --> 02:05:53.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:55.750 --> 02:05:55.760 align:start position:0%
in addition to the Manchester locations
 
02:05:57.870 --> 02:05:57.880 align:start position:0%
we have four community- based outpatient
 
02:05:59.790 --> 02:05:59.800 align:start position:0%
clinics you'll hear them called
 
02:06:02.709 --> 02:06:02.719 align:start position:0%
seabox uh we've got one way up in Conway
 
02:06:04.229 --> 02:06:04.239 align:start position:0%
and then we have two on the Sea Coast
 
02:06:06.229 --> 02:06:06.239 align:start position:0%
one in Portsmouth and one in
 
02:06:08.470 --> 02:06:08.480 align:start position:0%
summersworth and lastly there's one up
 
02:06:11.910 --> 02:06:11.920 align:start position:0%
93 in Tilton those seab box really
 
02:06:15.589 --> 02:06:15.599 align:start position:0%
provide comprehensive Primary Care some
 
02:06:19.589 --> 02:06:19.599 align:start position:0%
Specialty Care Labs um mental health you
 
02:06:21.669 --> 02:06:21.679 align:start position:0%
know we we really try to get as much
 
02:06:24.350 --> 02:06:24.360 align:start position:0%
care as we can into the seab boox to to
 
02:06:27.390 --> 02:06:27.400 align:start position:0%
allow veterans who are more rural to get
 
02:06:31.709 --> 02:06:31.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:36.069 --> 02:06:36.079 align:start position:0%
home our um Journey for to to become and
 
02:06:39.270 --> 02:06:39.280 align:start position:0%
and continue to sustain uh our um
 
02:06:41.310 --> 02:06:41.320 align:start position:0%
reputation of being a high reliability
 
02:06:43.910 --> 02:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
organization really has been uh
 
02:06:47.549 --> 02:06:47.559 align:start position:0%
surrounding three pillars um one of them
 
02:06:50.830 --> 02:06:50.840 align:start position:0%
being uh leadership commitment um
 
02:06:52.669 --> 02:06:52.679 align:start position:0%
running a culture that it really
 
02:06:55.109 --> 02:06:55.119 align:start position:0%
surrounds and embodies safety um at
 
02:06:57.069 --> 02:06:57.079 align:start position:0%
every level not just patient safety but
 
02:06:59.910 --> 02:06:59.920 align:start position:0%
staff safety as well and just continuous
 
02:07:02.109 --> 02:07:02.119 align:start position:0%
process Improvement so you know you'll
 
02:07:04.709 --> 02:07:04.719 align:start position:0%
see um these principles of hro are
 
02:07:06.870 --> 02:07:06.880 align:start position:0%
really embedded into our health care
 
02:07:09.669 --> 02:07:09.679 align:start position:0%
decisions um we don't probably have many
 
02:07:11.470 --> 02:07:11.480 align:start position:0%
meetings these days without starting off
 
02:07:13.790 --> 02:07:13.800 align:start position:0%
with a safety story you know sometimes
 
02:07:16.109 --> 02:07:16.119 align:start position:0%
they're they're um reactive because
 
02:07:18.629 --> 02:07:18.639 align:start position:0%
something that we did not want happen
 
02:07:20.830 --> 02:07:20.840 align:start position:0%
happened other times they're proactive
 
02:07:22.709 --> 02:07:22.719 align:start position:0%
and they're near Miss and we talk about
 
02:07:25.830 --> 02:07:25.840 align:start position:0%
them and we don't assume that oh it's a
 
02:07:28.470 --> 02:07:28.480 align:start position:0%
near miss so we're good right no we have
 
02:07:30.709 --> 02:07:30.719 align:start position:0%
to stop and pause and assess the process
 
02:07:32.270 --> 02:07:32.280 align:start position:0%
and see have we really set up our
 
02:07:35.430 --> 02:07:35.440 align:start position:0%
employees for Success um and so uh these
 
02:07:38.030 --> 02:07:38.040 align:start position:0%
are the pillars that we really um are
 
02:07:40.270 --> 02:07:40.280 align:start position:0%
committed to and and we've just had a
 
02:07:43.030 --> 02:07:43.040 align:start position:0%
lot of success in the realm of um hro
 
02:07:48.629 --> 02:07:48.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:50.830 --> 02:07:50.840 align:start position:0%
organization we have quite a bit of
 
02:07:52.750 --> 02:07:52.760 align:start position:0%
specialty care that we offer through our
 
02:07:54.830 --> 02:07:54.840 align:start position:0%
healthc care system I won't read them
 
02:07:56.669 --> 02:07:56.679 align:start position:0%
all to you unless you'd like me to
 
02:07:58.790 --> 02:07:58.800 align:start position:0%
they're on um the VA Manchester
 
02:08:01.990 --> 02:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
excellence and Healthcare page uh other
 
02:08:04.069 --> 02:08:04.079 align:start position:0%
than the um primary care teams that I
 
02:08:06.669 --> 02:08:06.679 align:start position:0%
already mentioned uh which also includes
 
02:08:08.910 --> 02:08:08.920 align:start position:0%
uh specialty uh women's health clinics
 
02:08:12.030 --> 02:08:12.040 align:start position:0%
with Gynecology Services we also have uh
 
02:08:15.510 --> 02:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
a realm of other specialty clinics um
 
02:08:18.950 --> 02:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
you know within uh Manchester and and
 
02:08:21.669 --> 02:08:21.679 align:start position:0%
offered face tof face on tella health in
 
02:08:23.669 --> 02:08:23.679 align:start position:0%
various different forms sometimes
 
02:08:26.069 --> 02:08:26.079 align:start position:0%
through the CR um where we're able to
 
02:08:27.910 --> 02:08:27.920 align:start position:0%
tap into other sites where they have
 
02:08:29.390 --> 02:08:29.400 align:start position:0%
Specialists that are harder to find in
 
02:08:32.270 --> 02:08:32.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um and so we're really
 
02:08:33.910 --> 02:08:33.920 align:start position:0%
proud of how much we've been able to
 
02:08:36.629 --> 02:08:36.639 align:start position:0%
grow in the realm of specialty medicine
 
02:08:38.510 --> 02:08:38.520 align:start position:0%
and you know we were really lucky when
 
02:08:40.910 --> 02:08:40.920 align:start position:0%
the pandemic hit because we were already
 
02:08:43.229 --> 02:08:43.239 align:start position:0%
uh much farther ahead with telea health
 
02:08:45.470 --> 02:08:45.480 align:start position:0%
technology than some in the healthcare
 
02:08:47.470 --> 02:08:47.480 align:start position:0%
industry so we've just been able to take
 
02:08:54.990 --> 02:08:55.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:56.830 --> 02:08:56.840 align:start position:0%
our tella Health appointments have
 
02:08:59.149 --> 02:08:59.159 align:start position:0%
increased every year they they increase
 
02:09:02.709 --> 02:09:02.719 align:start position:0%
this past year from um in from 23 to 24
 
02:09:05.390 --> 02:09:05.400 align:start position:0%
they increased to nearly 15% and they
 
02:09:05.400 --> 02:09:06.950 align:start position:0%
they increased to nearly 15% and they
delivered

02:09:06.950 --> 02:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
delivered
 
02:09:09.109 --> 02:09:09.119 align:start position:0%
43289 teleah Health
 
02:09:12.189 --> 02:09:12.199 align:start position:0%
appointments um and we've got I didn't I
 
02:09:13.990 --> 02:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
wasn't going to list all of them here
 
02:09:15.750 --> 02:09:15.760 align:start position:0%
it's probably a list of 100 or more
 
02:09:17.350 --> 02:09:17.360 align:start position:0%
teleah Health type clinics that we
 
02:09:20.030 --> 02:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
actually have um but the the most
 
02:09:27.910 --> 02:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:30.990 --> 02:09:31.000 align:start position:0%
information some of our significant
 
02:09:33.510 --> 02:09:33.520 align:start position:0%
accomplishments uh we started a what we
 
02:09:35.149 --> 02:09:35.159 align:start position:0%
consider to be a really Innovative
 
02:09:37.350 --> 02:09:37.360 align:start position:0%
program um we call it the community
 
02:09:40.109 --> 02:09:40.119 align:start position:0%
Navigator program where uh we started
 
02:09:43.549 --> 02:09:43.559 align:start position:0%
sending um partnering with our our um
 
02:09:45.350 --> 02:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
Hospital Partners in the community we
 
02:09:48.310 --> 02:09:48.320 align:start position:0%
started embedding nurses in the
 
02:09:51.549 --> 02:09:51.559 align:start position:0%
inpatient units of the hospitals and so
 
02:09:53.629 --> 02:09:53.639 align:start position:0%
where we do not have an inpatient unit
 
02:09:56.270 --> 02:09:56.280 align:start position:0%
at Manchester we have a nurse that is
 
02:09:58.149 --> 02:09:58.159 align:start position:0%
out at these Community Hospitals and
 
02:10:00.870 --> 02:10:00.880 align:start position:0%
when our veterans are in patient they
 
02:10:04.109 --> 02:10:04.119 align:start position:0%
are um visited by this nurse and this is
 
02:10:05.990 --> 02:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
whether or not they're enrolled in VA
 
02:10:08.189 --> 02:10:08.199 align:start position:0%
Healthcare or not all veterans are
 
02:10:11.310 --> 02:10:11.320 align:start position:0%
visited and basically you know we really
 
02:10:14.189 --> 02:10:14.199 align:start position:0%
want to enhance the discharge process um
 
02:10:17.549 --> 02:10:17.559 align:start position:0%
Hospital readmissions are are huge um
 
02:10:19.669 --> 02:10:19.679 align:start position:0%
distractor to our health care System
 
02:10:22.030 --> 02:10:22.040 align:start position:0%
across the board and so if we can be
 
02:10:24.669 --> 02:10:24.679 align:start position:0%
there to handhold and make sure that the
 
02:10:27.430 --> 02:10:27.440 align:start position:0%
discharge team um communicates strongly
 
02:10:30.149 --> 02:10:30.159 align:start position:0%
with our discharge team and that we have
 
02:10:32.830 --> 02:10:32.840 align:start position:0%
medications um ready to go any durable
 
02:10:35.350 --> 02:10:35.360 align:start position:0%
medical equipment follow-ups with their
 
02:10:38.109 --> 02:10:38.119 align:start position:0%
primary care that are timely um we've
 
02:10:39.510 --> 02:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
really had great success with this
 
02:10:41.390 --> 02:10:41.400 align:start position:0%
program the latest addition is we've
 
02:10:43.149 --> 02:10:43.159 align:start position:0%
been able to embed a hospital list on
 
02:10:46.030 --> 02:10:46.040 align:start position:0%
our side so if you are being discharged
 
02:10:48.990 --> 02:10:49.000 align:start position:0%
from inpatient and then um going back
 
02:10:51.910 --> 02:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
home um you will very soon have a
 
02:10:55.229 --> 02:10:55.239 align:start position:0%
hospitalist appointment that is um
 
02:10:58.109 --> 02:10:58.119 align:start position:0%
timely as recommended by the hospitalist
 
02:11:01.069 --> 02:11:01.079 align:start position:0%
who was treating you while impatient and
 
02:11:03.589 --> 02:11:03.599 align:start position:0%
um just the transition of care and um
 
02:11:06.390 --> 02:11:06.400 align:start position:0%
back to home is so much stronger uh
 
02:11:08.149 --> 02:11:08.159 align:start position:0%
we've had a lot of stories since we've
 
02:11:10.149 --> 02:11:10.159 align:start position:0%
started this program as well of veterans
 
02:11:12.229 --> 02:11:12.239 align:start position:0%
who were not enrolled in healthcare some
 
02:11:14.589 --> 02:11:14.599 align:start position:0%
who are 100% service connected and just
 
02:11:16.830 --> 02:11:16.840 align:start position:0%
did not know what they could get from
 
02:11:18.910 --> 02:11:18.920 align:start position:0%
our system we've been able to pull them
 
02:11:20.830 --> 02:11:20.840 align:start position:0%
into the system and educate them on
 
02:11:22.750 --> 02:11:22.760 align:start position:0%
their better benefits and and now
 
02:11:24.830 --> 02:11:24.840 align:start position:0%
they're um you know getting Primary Care
 
02:11:27.470 --> 02:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
through VA Manchester so it's it's a
 
02:11:29.990 --> 02:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
program that we'd like to see expand uh
 
02:11:32.030 --> 02:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
it's just we we haven't heard enough
 
02:11:33.549 --> 02:11:33.559 align:start position:0%
good things about it and it's just the
 
02:11:37.069 --> 02:11:37.079 align:start position:0%
clinical outcomes are are so impressive
 
02:11:40.310 --> 02:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
so uh we did receive the national 2023
 
02:11:42.149 --> 02:11:42.159 align:start position:0%
service to Citizen Award for providing
 
02:11:43.750 --> 02:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
teleah Health Audiology healthc care
 
02:11:46.669 --> 02:11:46.679 align:start position:0%
services to rural patients uh one great
 
02:11:49.549 --> 02:11:49.559 align:start position:0%
benefit in the VA are our hearing aids
 
02:11:51.470 --> 02:11:51.480 align:start position:0%
are provided and and for those those of
 
02:11:53.589 --> 02:11:53.599 align:start position:0%
you that don't know hearing aids outside
 
02:11:55.270 --> 02:11:55.280 align:start position:0%
the VA in the healthcare system can be
 
02:11:58.510 --> 02:11:58.520 align:start position:0%
quite costly although I've I've heard no
 
02:12:00.030 --> 02:12:00.040 align:start position:0%
pun intended that that there's some
 
02:12:02.870 --> 02:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
newer technology out there but um you
 
02:12:05.470 --> 02:12:05.480 align:start position:0%
know for a lot of our veterans that are
 
02:12:09.510 --> 02:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
remote um or rural um tra traveling
 
02:12:10.589 --> 02:12:10.599 align:start position:0%
because you have to have your hearing
 
02:12:12.950 --> 02:12:12.960 align:start position:0%
aids um molded and it requires more than
 
02:12:14.830 --> 02:12:14.840 align:start position:0%
one appointment traveling from all the
 
02:12:16.750 --> 02:12:16.760 align:start position:0%
way from Conway down to Manchester more
 
02:12:19.910 --> 02:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
than one time for for a a population of
 
02:12:22.390 --> 02:12:22.400 align:start position:0%
veterans that most often are older is
 
02:12:24.790 --> 02:12:24.800 align:start position:0%
difficult and so this is an example of
 
02:12:26.629 --> 02:12:26.639 align:start position:0%
something where we have built uh
 
02:12:28.510 --> 02:12:28.520 align:start position:0%
effective telea Health Services with
 
02:12:30.790 --> 02:12:30.800 align:start position:0%
technicians on the patient side
 
02:12:32.910 --> 02:12:32.920 align:start position:0%
audiologists on the home side the
 
02:12:35.870 --> 02:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
Manchester side we can have a veteran in
 
02:12:39.229 --> 02:12:39.239 align:start position:0%
Conway um sitting with the LPN tella
 
02:12:41.470 --> 02:12:41.480 align:start position:0%
Health um technician and our audiologist
 
02:12:42.990 --> 02:12:43.000 align:start position:0%
in Manchester can be adjusting their
 
02:12:45.910 --> 02:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
hearing aids to their to their needs so
 
02:12:48.109 --> 02:12:48.119 align:start position:0%
it's it's really amazing what technology
 
02:12:49.870 --> 02:12:49.880 align:start position:0%
has provided us and and we're really
 
02:12:52.430 --> 02:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
proud of that program
 
02:12:53.950 --> 02:12:53.960 align:start position:0%
something else we were celebrating not
 
02:12:56.310 --> 02:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
so long ago I think it was in
 
02:12:59.229 --> 02:12:59.239 align:start position:0%
December uh we surpassed the 30,000
 
02:13:01.709 --> 02:13:01.719 align:start position:0%
veteran marks so we now serve um and
 
02:13:04.589 --> 02:13:04.599 align:start position:0%
have 30,000 or well more than 30,000
 
02:13:06.549 --> 02:13:06.559 align:start position:0%
veterans enrolled within our Health Care
 
02:13:08.589 --> 02:13:08.599 align:start position:0%
system so you know between the packed
 
02:13:10.990 --> 02:13:11.000 align:start position:0%
act the compact act and really
 
02:13:12.910 --> 02:13:12.920 align:start position:0%
aggressive Outreach that we have uh
 
02:13:14.310 --> 02:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
throughout New Hampshire as well as many
 
02:13:16.470 --> 02:13:16.480 align:start position:0%
of the partners that are in this room
 
02:13:18.910 --> 02:13:18.920 align:start position:0%
who have previously spoken uh we've just
 
02:13:21.350 --> 02:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
been able to grow um in in in an
 
02:13:22.950 --> 02:13:22.960 align:start position:0%
environment in New England where not a
 
02:13:24.990 --> 02:13:25.000 align:start position:0%
lot of vas or not all the vas are
 
02:13:27.549 --> 02:13:27.559 align:start position:0%
growing right so um there's a lot more
 
02:13:31.149 --> 02:13:31.159 align:start position:0%
growth in the southern states within the
 
02:13:35.069 --> 02:13:35.079 align:start position:0%
VA I wanted to share um that a couple of
 
02:13:36.510 --> 02:13:36.520 align:start position:0%

02:16:30.149 --> 02:16:30.159 align:start position:0%
full-time part-time how many folks uh
 
02:16:31.790 --> 02:16:31.800 align:start position:0%
are and and I know you have these
 
02:16:33.790 --> 02:16:33.800 align:start position:0%
satellite operations too so it's kind of
 
02:16:36.349 --> 02:16:36.359 align:start position:0%
hard question to answer but about how
 
02:16:40.150 --> 02:16:40.160 align:start position:0%
many people uh work for uh the let me
 
02:16:42.429 --> 02:16:42.439 align:start position:0%
get this right the VA Manchester Health
 
02:16:46.740 --> 02:16:46.750 align:start position:0%
Care System we currently have
 
02:16:46.750 --> 02:16:48.030 align:start position:0%
Care System we currently have
[Music]

02:16:48.030 --> 02:16:48.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:16:51.950 --> 02:16:51.960 align:start position:0%
1,25 employees last count
 
02:16:56.509 --> 02:16:56.519 align:start position:0%
um so dispersed throughout those those
 
02:17:00.950 --> 02:17:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:04.389 --> 02:17:04.399 align:start position:0%
you questions or comments um represent
 
02:17:07.830 --> 02:17:07.840 align:start position:0%
mandle bomb thank you Mr chairman so I
 
02:17:10.349 --> 02:17:10.359 align:start position:0%
see that um included in one of your
 
02:17:12.509 --> 02:17:12.519 align:start position:0%
priorities is providing veterans with
 
02:17:14.990 --> 02:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
timely health care and I've heard that
 
02:17:18.389 --> 02:17:18.399 align:start position:0%
weight times at the VA can be fairly
 
02:17:20.910 --> 02:17:20.920 align:start position:0%
long I'm wondering to what extent your
 
02:17:22.709 --> 02:17:22.719 align:start position:0%
seeing that at the Manchester ba
 
02:17:22.719 --> 02:17:24.030 align:start position:0%
seeing that at the Manchester ba
Healthcare

02:17:24.030 --> 02:17:24.040 align:start position:0%
Healthcare
 
02:17:26.270 --> 02:17:26.280 align:start position:0%
System we're not struggling with that
 
02:17:29.270 --> 02:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
terribly we have uh initiatives where
 
02:17:32.150 --> 02:17:32.160 align:start position:0%
we're um scrubbing each individual
 
02:17:34.589 --> 02:17:34.599 align:start position:0%
service and looking at next available
 
02:17:37.790 --> 02:17:37.800 align:start position:0%
weight time specifically um that when we
 
02:17:40.190 --> 02:17:40.200 align:start position:0%
have struggled it's been for new
 
02:17:42.950 --> 02:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
appointments and so um looking and
 
02:17:45.230 --> 02:17:45.240 align:start position:0%
scrubbing the days and the workload and
 
02:17:48.110 --> 02:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
the productivity of every provider
 
02:17:50.110 --> 02:17:50.120 align:start position:0%
really has been the way that we're able
 
02:17:53.429 --> 02:17:53.439 align:start position:0%
to sustain access as far as access in
 
02:17:55.270 --> 02:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
the community versus access through the
 
02:17:58.509 --> 02:17:58.519 align:start position:0%
VA most often with specialty care we
 
02:18:02.070 --> 02:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
have sooner access um we try to sustain
 
02:18:04.790 --> 02:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
that it's not always possible but um you
 
02:18:07.870 --> 02:18:07.880 align:start position:0%
know we've got clinicians that um uh
 
02:18:09.709 --> 02:18:09.719 align:start position:0%
scrub these referrals and make sure that
 
02:18:11.589 --> 02:18:11.599 align:start position:0%
if there's anything timely that it's
 
02:18:14.429 --> 02:18:14.439 align:start position:0%
prioritized and um we're doing pretty
 
02:18:16.389 --> 02:18:16.399 align:start position:0%
well you know we've had our blips where
 
02:18:18.190 --> 02:18:18.200 align:start position:0%
we've got you know you've got staff that
 
02:18:20.389 --> 02:18:20.399 align:start position:0%
maybe became ill and or had to go out
 
02:18:23.030 --> 02:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
for longer term and and naturally those
 
02:18:25.429 --> 02:18:25.439 align:start position:0%
things um affect your weight times but
 
02:18:28.230 --> 02:18:28.240 align:start position:0%
we're able to really engage with HR and
 
02:18:31.750 --> 02:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
get recruitments um um moving in at a
 
02:18:34.270 --> 02:18:34.280 align:start position:0%
timely fashion uh which wasn't always
 
02:18:36.429 --> 02:18:36.439 align:start position:0%
the case it was a struggle uh years back
 
02:18:38.709 --> 02:18:38.719 align:start position:0%
but they're doing a great job for us so
 
02:18:42.030 --> 02:18:42.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:45.910 --> 02:18:45.920 align:start position:0%
you reps and f um just real quick uh I
 
02:18:48.990 --> 02:18:49.000 align:start position:0%
think we ran out of hand uh handouts oh
 
02:18:50.349 --> 02:18:50.359 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you because I would really
 
02:18:52.230 --> 02:18:52.240 align:start position:0%
like that for my future reference yeah
 
02:18:52.240 --> 02:18:54.150 align:start position:0%
like that for my future reference yeah
great

02:18:54.150 --> 02:18:54.160 align:start position:0%
great
 
02:18:57.830 --> 02:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
you representative budak a quick
 
02:19:00.509 --> 02:19:00.519 align:start position:0%
question um we often hear that veterans
 
02:19:03.230 --> 02:19:03.240 align:start position:0%
are not getting Mental Health Care uh
 
02:19:04.910 --> 02:19:04.920 align:start position:0%
could you please share light on
 
02:19:09.349 --> 02:19:09.359 align:start position:0%
this so we have mental health care in um
 
02:19:12.549 --> 02:19:12.559 align:start position:0%
various formats at our within our health
 
02:19:14.870 --> 02:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
care System there's a good amount of
 
02:19:17.870 --> 02:19:17.880 align:start position:0%
Health Care since the pandemic hit us
 
02:19:20.709 --> 02:19:20.719 align:start position:0%
that has been transitioned face um over
 
02:19:23.669 --> 02:19:23.679 align:start position:0%
over VVC uh tella Health Services
 
02:19:25.950 --> 02:19:25.960 align:start position:0%
however that is driven by the patient's
 
02:19:29.110 --> 02:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
um desire to have that so if a patient
 
02:19:30.549 --> 02:19:30.559 align:start position:0%
wishes to have face-to-face mental
 
02:19:32.750 --> 02:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
health care we will organize that to
 
02:19:34.709 --> 02:19:34.719 align:start position:0%
occur whether it's at Manchester or one
 
02:19:37.110 --> 02:19:37.120 align:start position:0%
of the um Community Based outpatient
 
02:19:42.030 --> 02:19:42.040 align:start position:0%
clinics uh we have uh a great staff of
 
02:19:44.990 --> 02:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
uh psychologists we've got four
 
02:19:48.270 --> 02:19:48.280 align:start position:0%
psychiatrists on staff um they have open
 
02:19:50.830 --> 02:19:50.840 align:start position:0%
access the Psychiatry team right now so
 
02:19:54.110 --> 02:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
if we have some urgent um uh issue to
 
02:19:56.190 --> 02:19:56.200 align:start position:0%
handle we've got we're able to get them
 
02:19:59.950 --> 02:19:59.960 align:start position:0%
in same week at this point um with the
 
02:20:02.150 --> 02:20:02.160 align:start position:0%
the scrubbing and and ongoing cleaning
 
02:20:04.630 --> 02:20:04.640 align:start position:0%
of uh workload and productivity clinics
 
02:20:06.389 --> 02:20:06.399 align:start position:0%
that that really the administrative
 
02:20:08.710 --> 02:20:08.720 align:start position:0%
officers throughout the system have been
 
02:20:11.190 --> 02:20:11.200 align:start position:0%
tasked to do as a regular work weekly
 
02:20:14.670 --> 02:20:14.680 align:start position:0%

02:20:14.680 --> 02:20:16.230 align:start position:0%
work um so I hope that answers your
question

02:20:16.230 --> 02:20:16.240 align:start position:0%

Jones Thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:20:23.510 --> 02:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
for being here um just a quick question
 
02:20:25.870 --> 02:20:25.880 align:start position:0%
do you have like an outreach program
 
02:20:27.590 --> 02:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
like where guest speakers will come
 
02:20:31.150 --> 02:20:31.160 align:start position:0%
visit a VFW meeting and explain the
 
02:20:33.750 --> 02:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
benefits to them and how they can yeah
 
02:20:36.710 --> 02:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
get to them absolutely we have a
 
02:20:38.429 --> 02:20:38.439 align:start position:0%
full-time Outreach coordinator his name
 
02:20:40.469 --> 02:20:40.479 align:start position:0%
is Michael Bist I'm sure some in this
 
02:20:42.469 --> 02:20:42.479 align:start position:0%
room know him well because he is really
 
02:20:44.670 --> 02:20:44.680 align:start position:0%
all over New Hampshire but we partner
 
02:20:47.429 --> 02:20:47.439 align:start position:0%
with VBA quite a bit on Outreach events
 
02:20:49.670 --> 02:20:49.680 align:start position:0%
as well uh and then we have several
 
02:20:51.510 --> 02:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
members of our Medical staff that are on
 
02:20:55.270 --> 02:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
the Outreach team with Mr Bist so yes

and if there's a site that you know um
 
02:20:59.590 --> 02:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
is interested that we haven't become
 
02:21:01.790 --> 02:21:01.800 align:start position:0%
engaged with yet please um share with me
 
02:21:04.110 --> 02:21:04.120 align:start position:0%
and I will get it back to him um I think
 
02:21:06.030 --> 02:21:06.040 align:start position:0%
he told me at last count when he was
 
02:21:09.429 --> 02:21:09.439 align:start position:0%

anything
 
02:21:25.790 --> 02:21:25.800 align:start position:0%
else Jo I have one F final question I
 
02:21:27.190 --> 02:21:27.200 align:start position:0%
had asked you about the numbers of
 
02:21:29.510 --> 02:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
employees before uh in terms of Staffing
 
02:21:31.670 --> 02:21:31.680 align:start position:0%
and recruiting are there any areas that
 
02:21:33.550 --> 02:21:33.560 align:start position:0%
you're really struggling with in terms
 
02:21:38.750 --> 02:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
of uh uh nurses or Specialists or
 
02:21:42.270 --> 02:21:42.280 align:start position:0%
whatever we do pretty well with nursing
 
02:21:44.270 --> 02:21:44.280 align:start position:0%
uh we've got a great culture at our
 
02:21:46.270 --> 02:21:46.280 align:start position:0%
Medical Center we've been able to on
 
02:21:49.630 --> 02:21:49.640 align:start position:0%
board nursing of various Specialties the
 
02:21:53.790 --> 02:21:53.800 align:start position:0%
one area that we'd love to um see more
 
02:21:55.070 --> 02:21:55.080 align:start position:0%
of is
 
02:21:58.349 --> 02:21:58.359 align:start position:0%
psychology um we have recruits out there
 
02:22:00.190 --> 02:22:00.200 align:start position:0%
right now we're we it's not that we
 
02:22:03.550 --> 02:22:03.560 align:start position:0%
aren't finding psychologists but frankly
 
02:22:07.309 --> 02:22:07.319 align:start position:0%
um you know we probably can um pull in
 
02:22:10.429 --> 02:22:10.439 align:start position:0%
some more um there's always a a need for
 
02:22:13.070 --> 02:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
um filling some vacancies there um to
 
02:22:16.550 --> 02:22:16.560 align:start position:0%
balance out our Psychiatry psychology um
 
02:22:16.560 --> 02:22:21.150 align:start position:0%
balance out our Psychiatry psychology um
workload

02:22:21.150 --> 02:22:21.160 align:start position:0%

02:23:46.269 --> 02:23:46.279 align:start position:0%
hold them
 
02:23:49.150 --> 02:23:49.160 align:start position:0%
accountable um what I just want to make
 
02:23:50.790 --> 02:23:50.800 align:start position:0%
one statement about the veterans home
 
02:23:52.349 --> 02:23:52.359 align:start position:0%
that kind of Echoes what Shawn said
 
02:23:54.190 --> 02:23:54.200 align:start position:0%
luckily Shawn was there yesterday to to
 
02:23:55.950 --> 02:23:55.960 align:start position:0%
witness the final salute that the
 
02:23:58.230 --> 02:23:58.240 align:start position:0%
veterans home it's not a sad place it's
 
02:24:01.389 --> 02:24:01.399 align:start position:0%
a on the contrary a very happy place we
 
02:24:03.190 --> 02:24:03.200 align:start position:0%
have kind of an Unwritten model there
 
02:24:05.309 --> 02:24:05.319 align:start position:0%
that a lot of people think of a nursing
 
02:24:06.870 --> 02:24:06.880 align:start position:0%
home as a place you you go it's your
 
02:24:08.990 --> 02:24:09.000 align:start position:0%
final stop you're going there to die so
 
02:24:11.510 --> 02:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
what we we kind of push as a staff is we
 
02:24:12.670 --> 02:24:12.680 align:start position:0%
don't want people to feel like they're
 
02:24:14.870 --> 02:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
coming there to die we want them to feel
 
02:24:16.389 --> 02:24:16.399 align:start position:0%
like they're coming there to live the
 
02:24:18.950 --> 02:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
rest of their lives and we're able to do
 
02:24:21.349 --> 02:24:21.359 align:start position:0%
that by giving them not only the best
 
02:24:23.269 --> 02:24:23.279 align:start position:0%
Services the best care but we do a lot
 
02:24:25.910 --> 02:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
of a lot of things that maybe they
 
02:24:27.429 --> 02:24:27.439 align:start position:0%
weren't able to experience in their
 
02:24:30.710 --> 02:24:30.720 align:start position:0%
lives uh going on trips uh different
 
02:24:32.950 --> 02:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
activities and we're able to do that
 
02:24:34.550 --> 02:24:34.560 align:start position:0%
with the help of a lot of the veteran
 
02:24:36.510 --> 02:24:36.520 align:start position:0%
service organizations the people behind
 
02:24:39.630 --> 02:24:39.640 align:start position:0%
me uh through donations and fundraising
 
02:24:41.990 --> 02:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
so we we do we have to be very careful
 
02:24:44.670 --> 02:24:44.680 align:start position:0%
with with using taxpayers money on our
 
02:24:47.150 --> 02:24:47.160 align:start position:0%
budget to give the veterans their needs
 
02:24:49.349 --> 02:24:49.359 align:start position:0%
so but because we want to give them the
 
02:24:50.870 --> 02:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
best care and the best Serv services
 
02:24:53.030 --> 02:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
that that we can give them we have a lot
 
02:24:55.030 --> 02:24:55.040 align:start position:0%
we want to fulfill a lot of their wants
 
02:24:56.830 --> 02:24:56.840 align:start position:0%
and again we we do that through the help
 
02:25:02.870 --> 02:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:04.790 --> 02:25:04.800 align:start position:0%
organizations all right I have a
 
02:25:07.389 --> 02:25:07.399 align:start position:0%
slideshow here and I want to just Echo
 
02:25:10.590 --> 02:25:10.600 align:start position:0%
what Brian is saying is um our motto is
 
02:25:13.790 --> 02:25:13.800 align:start position:0%
they we they don't live in our workplace
 
02:25:16.190 --> 02:25:16.200 align:start position:0%
we work in their home and so it doesn't
 
02:25:18.710 --> 02:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
matter if I am touring um which has
 
02:25:20.469 --> 02:25:20.479 align:start position:0%
happened when I've been touring a US
 
02:25:22.590 --> 02:25:22.600 align:start position:0%
Senator and someone wants the newspaper
 
02:25:24.030 --> 02:25:24.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to I'm going to stop that
 
02:25:25.950 --> 02:25:25.960 align:start position:0%
tour and get them the newspaper because
 
02:25:28.790 --> 02:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
the veteran is the most important person
 
02:25:31.750 --> 02:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
in that facility um so if you come I
 
02:25:34.750 --> 02:25:34.760 align:start position:0%
hope you do come don't feel um at all
 
02:25:36.710 --> 02:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
like bad if I stop a tour and get a
 
02:25:39.110 --> 02:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
newspaper um but it you'll see the
 
02:25:40.550 --> 02:25:40.560 align:start position:0%
slideshow I'll try to be quick because I
 
02:25:42.630 --> 02:25:42.640 align:start position:0%
know that we do have a a tight time and
 
02:25:46.070 --> 02:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
we're starting late um but in 1889 to
 
02:25:47.710 --> 02:25:47.720 align:start position:0%
take advantage of the federal assistance
 
02:25:49.830 --> 02:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
Governor David Goodale established the
 
02:25:52.750 --> 02:25:52.760 align:start position:0%
veterans Board of managers um and it was
 
02:25:54.630 --> 02:25:54.640 align:start position:0%
made up of prominent citizens and we
 
02:25:56.790 --> 02:25:56.800 align:start position:0%
have a lot of the artifacts from them
 
02:25:59.269 --> 02:25:59.279 align:start position:0%
and um interestingly the commant the
 
02:26:02.750 --> 02:26:02.760 align:start position:0%
second commant only made $100 a month so
 
02:26:04.710 --> 02:26:04.720 align:start position:0%
we have all of their time cards it's
 
02:26:06.990 --> 02:26:07.000 align:start position:0%
quite interesting uh the facility was
 
02:26:08.830 --> 02:26:08.840 align:start position:0%
opened and dedicated to the Civil War
 
02:26:11.230 --> 02:26:11.240 align:start position:0%
soldiers unable to care for themselves
 
02:26:14.750 --> 02:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
and this past December was um a a big
 
02:26:18.469 --> 02:26:18.479 align:start position:0%
anniversary um I will point out in 135
 
02:26:19.870 --> 02:26:19.880 align:start position:0%
years which I don't think a lot of
 
02:26:22.630 --> 02:26:22.640 align:start position:0%
people can say this but in 135 years
 
02:26:25.510 --> 02:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
there have only been 11 commants 11
 
02:26:28.630 --> 02:26:28.640 align:start position:0%
commants in 135 years so 10 people held
 
02:26:30.950 --> 02:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
my job before I was there it's quite
 
02:26:33.590 --> 02:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
quite an honor to be there um we have a
 
02:26:35.910 --> 02:26:35.920 align:start position:0%
board of managers so I have two bosses
 
02:26:38.070 --> 02:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
two sets of Boss the governor is my
 
02:26:40.590 --> 02:26:40.600 align:start position:0%
first set um and then the board of
 
02:26:42.990 --> 02:26:43.000 align:start position:0%
managers is made up of 12 members who
 
02:26:44.389 --> 02:26:44.399 align:start position:0%
are appointed by the governor and
 
02:26:46.750 --> 02:26:46.760 align:start position:0%
confirmed by the governor's Council um
 
02:26:48.590 --> 02:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
the commanders from the American Legion
 
02:26:50.670 --> 02:26:50.680 align:start position:0%
the veteran Foreign Wars and the
 
02:26:53.150 --> 02:26:53.160 align:start position:0%
disabled American veterans and nine
 
02:26:55.710 --> 02:26:55.720 align:start position:0%
citizens make up the board of managers
 
02:26:57.910 --> 02:26:57.920 align:start position:0%
TW two of the 12 members are residents
 
02:27:00.030 --> 02:27:00.040 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire veterans home and
 
02:27:02.590 --> 02:27:02.600 align:start position:0%
you'll see the photo in uh in that
 
02:27:04.750 --> 02:27:04.760 align:start position:0%
PowerPoint and the board has oversight
 
02:27:07.990 --> 02:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
of the veterans benefit operations um as
 
02:27:10.150 --> 02:27:10.160 align:start position:0%
well as appoints the commant so they
 
02:27:12.550 --> 02:27:12.560 align:start position:0%
choose me they can dismiss me but the
 
02:27:14.630 --> 02:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
governor chooses my salary it's a very
 
02:27:17.870 --> 02:27:17.880 align:start position:0%
unusual event but um really works well
 
02:27:19.710 --> 02:27:19.720 align:start position:0%
because it's not a political appointment
 
02:27:21.670 --> 02:27:21.680 align:start position:0%
it's about who can do the job you have
 
02:27:23.030 --> 02:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
to be a licensed nursing home
 
02:27:25.830 --> 02:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
administrator and so um I was honored
 
02:27:27.590 --> 02:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
three years ago to be picked and I just
 
02:27:29.349 --> 02:27:29.359 align:start position:0%
want to recognize a couple of the board
 
02:27:31.070 --> 02:27:31.080 align:start position:0%

02:27:34.150 --> 02:27:34.160 align:start position:0%

month and and um talk about the facility
 
02:27:54.309 --> 02:27:54.319 align:start position:0%
and how we're going to spend the donated
 
02:27:58.950 --> 02:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
Monies to f u fund the quality of life
 
02:28:00.990 --> 02:28:01.000 align:start position:0%
um the New Hampshire Veterans Home is an
 
02:28:02.750 --> 02:28:02.760 align:start position:0%

facility um we are licensed for 250
 
02:28:11.590 --> 02:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
residents we are budgeted by the state
 
02:28:11.600 --> 02:28:12.990 align:start position:0%
residents we are budgeted by the state

02:28:12.990 --> 02:28:13.000 align:start position:0%

225 um we have a budget of 384 staff by
 
02:28:19.630 --> 02:28:19.640 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire we are all
 
02:28:22.630 --> 02:28:22.640 align:start position:0%
state employees um and we do have some
 
02:28:24.429 --> 02:28:24.439 align:start position:0%
contracted Services through our our
 
02:28:26.870 --> 02:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
medical team recently our greatest
 
02:28:28.269 --> 02:28:28.279 align:start position:0%
challenge has been recruiting and
 
02:28:30.269 --> 02:28:30.279 align:start position:0%
retaining staff in both our clinical and
 
02:28:33.030 --> 02:28:33.040 align:start position:0%
support services um the New Hampshire
 
02:28:36.510 --> 02:28:36.520 align:start position:0%
Veterans Home uh is in is um the program
 
02:28:38.510 --> 02:28:38.520 align:start position:0%
is paid for we don't take Medicare
 
02:28:41.550 --> 02:28:41.560 align:start position:0%
Medicaid we actually are through the VA
 
02:28:44.309 --> 02:28:44.319 align:start position:0%
grants we are paid for by the grant the
 
02:28:47.550 --> 02:28:47.560 align:start position:0%
VA the state and the veterans themselves
 
02:28:49.590 --> 02:28:49.600 align:start position:0%
and I've added the CFR that's here that
 
02:28:51.750 --> 02:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
over sees us so if you are interested
 
02:28:53.870 --> 02:28:53.880 align:start position:0%
it's 38 CFR
 
02:28:57.510 --> 02:28:57.520 align:start position:0%
5141 any government CFR is quite lengthy
 
02:28:59.710 --> 02:28:59.720 align:start position:0%
but you're welcome to look at that um
 
02:29:01.910 --> 02:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
veterans receive either a partial or
 
02:29:05.790 --> 02:29:05.800 align:start position:0%
full cost living reimbursement um so we
 
02:29:08.469 --> 02:29:08.479 align:start position:0%
have to have a uh annual certification
 
02:29:11.030 --> 02:29:11.040 align:start position:0%
to maintain our VA certification to be
 
02:29:13.230 --> 02:29:13.240 align:start position:0%
able to build them for each resident
 
02:29:15.590 --> 02:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
that lives with us the mission statement
 
02:29:17.190 --> 02:29:17.200 align:start position:0%
at New Hampshire Veterans Home is to
 
02:29:18.990 --> 02:29:19.000 align:start position:0%
provide the best quality of life for New
 
02:29:21.110 --> 02:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire veterans with dignity honor
 
02:29:23.190 --> 02:29:23.200 align:start position:0%
and respect and you will see that no
 
02:29:26.269 --> 02:29:26.279 align:start position:0%
matter um when you come to our facility
 
02:29:29.349 --> 02:29:29.359 align:start position:0%
if it's for a ceremony uh or a coffee
 
02:29:33.590 --> 02:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
hour the staff are there for the veteran
 
02:29:35.110 --> 02:29:35.120 align:start position:0%
uh some of the achievements I just want
 
02:29:38.630 --> 02:29:38.640 align:start position:0%
to push out there this past year we um
 
02:29:42.150 --> 02:29:42.160 align:start position:0%
well in 2022 we created an LNA program
 
02:29:46.070 --> 02:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
we as of now uh have 30 new lnas that
 
02:29:48.389 --> 02:29:48.399 align:start position:0%
have either enter they some of them have
 
02:29:50.990 --> 02:29:51.000 align:start position:0%
left in that time um um but most of them
 
02:29:52.790 --> 02:29:52.800 align:start position:0%
have stayed with us and we have another
 
02:29:55.309 --> 02:29:55.319 align:start position:0%
LNA class that just began on Monday with
 
02:29:58.830 --> 02:29:58.840 align:start position:0%
eight more uh LNA candidates we also
 
02:30:00.429 --> 02:30:00.439 align:start position:0%
created something called a licensed
 
02:30:02.870 --> 02:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
medication nursing assistant program in
 
02:30:05.070 --> 02:30:05.080 align:start position:0%
conjunction with the Board of Nursing so
 
02:30:07.710 --> 02:30:07.720 align:start position:0%
we can train those who are lnas to pass
 
02:30:10.469 --> 02:30:10.479 align:start position:0%
medications as well and we have uh had
 
02:30:13.990 --> 02:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
two uh 10 uh people who are now lnas
 
02:30:16.110 --> 02:30:16.120 align:start position:0%
that help us relieve some of that uh
 
02:30:17.910 --> 02:30:17.920 align:start position:0%
nursing shortage that we
 
02:30:21.590 --> 02:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
have we were awarded um and mostly for
 
02:30:24.349 --> 02:30:24.359 align:start position:0%
Brian's hard work the 2024 outstanding
 
02:30:26.910 --> 02:30:26.920 align:start position:0%
energy efficient project uh where we had
 
02:30:29.110 --> 02:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
a lighting Improvement project that was
 
02:30:32.110 --> 02:30:32.120 align:start position:0%
for our entire facility we replaced I
 
02:30:34.429 --> 02:30:34.439 align:start position:0%
would say almost every light bulb uh
 
02:30:37.710 --> 02:30:37.720 align:start position:0%
fixture in our facility at really no
 
02:30:41.910 --> 02:30:41.920 align:start position:0%
cost to us with eversource and uh Das
 
02:30:44.710 --> 02:30:44.720 align:start position:0%
and we are seeing Energy savings cuz all
 
02:30:46.750 --> 02:30:46.760 align:start position:0%
of the lights were changed over to LED
 
02:30:49.309 --> 02:30:49.319 align:start position:0%
we have a lot more control of when
 
02:30:50.750 --> 02:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
they're on and when they're off you do
 
02:30:51.950 --> 02:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
feel like a movie star when you walk
 
02:30:53.469 --> 02:30:53.479 align:start position:0%
through CU lights will come on as you
 
02:30:55.110 --> 02:30:55.120 align:start position:0%
start walking through cuz they motion
 
02:30:57.389 --> 02:30:57.399 align:start position:0%
detect but we're we really are seeing
 
02:30:59.150 --> 02:30:59.160 align:start position:0%
some savings with that for our monthly
 
02:31:01.429 --> 02:31:01.439 align:start position:0%
energy costs we also were able to
 
02:31:04.309 --> 02:31:04.319 align:start position:0%
approve security uh we all know the sad
 
02:31:05.950 --> 02:31:05.960 align:start position:0%
situation that happened at New Hampshire
 
02:31:07.950 --> 02:31:07.960 align:start position:0%
hospital which brings forward always
 
02:31:10.269 --> 02:31:10.279 align:start position:0%
Security in our facilities and we were
 
02:31:12.750 --> 02:31:12.760 align:start position:0%
able to add additional cameras so that
 
02:31:15.110 --> 02:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
there are no dead spots in our facility
 
02:31:18.070 --> 02:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
as far as uh cameras with the exception
 
02:31:19.710 --> 02:31:19.720 align:start position:0%
of bathrooms and bedrooms and we were
 
02:31:21.710 --> 02:31:21.720 align:start position:0%
talking talking common areas uh if we
 
02:31:24.150 --> 02:31:24.160 align:start position:0%
had a missing resident we can put in uh
 
02:31:26.429 --> 02:31:26.439 align:start position:0%
blue shirt brown pants and it will show
 
02:31:27.710 --> 02:31:27.720 align:start position:0%
us everywhere on the camera where
 
02:31:29.309 --> 02:31:29.319 align:start position:0%
there's somebody that's wearing that
 
02:31:32.030 --> 02:31:32.040 align:start position:0%
that clothing color combination so we
 
02:31:35.429 --> 02:31:35.439 align:start position:0%
know have outside view as well uh we
 
02:31:38.030 --> 02:31:38.040 align:start position:0%
were able to uh with enhance New
 
02:31:39.950 --> 02:31:39.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and some of the arpa money
 
02:31:43.389 --> 02:31:43.399 align:start position:0%
improve our uh Wi-Fi efficiency if you
 
02:31:45.309 --> 02:31:45.319 align:start position:0%
were in our building before there was
 
02:31:48.070 --> 02:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
very it was very hard to get service and
 
02:31:51.550 --> 02:31:51.560 align:start position:0%
um our average age is 83 but they have
 
02:31:54.190 --> 02:31:54.200 align:start position:0%
phones they have iPads and they are
 
02:31:56.309 --> 02:31:56.319 align:start position:0%
connected and they want to be connected
 
02:31:58.510 --> 02:31:58.520 align:start position:0%
so if they went from one place to
 
02:32:00.150 --> 02:32:00.160 align:start position:0%
another place in our facility they often
 
02:32:02.389 --> 02:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
were not connected so that has um been
 
02:32:04.469 --> 02:32:04.479 align:start position:0%
resolved so we're happy to uh report
 
02:32:06.830 --> 02:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
that and they're very happy about that
 
02:32:08.590 --> 02:32:08.600 align:start position:0%
the big piece that we want to share and
 
02:32:10.269 --> 02:32:10.279 align:start position:0%
please pass on to the people that you
 
02:32:12.750 --> 02:32:12.760 align:start position:0%
represent is that our admissions uh
 
02:32:15.790 --> 02:32:15.800 align:start position:0%
process did you was uh up to a year
 
02:32:17.349 --> 02:32:17.359 align:start position:0%
sometimes longer if people wanted to
 
02:32:19.269 --> 02:32:19.279 align:start position:0%
come to the New Hampshire veterans home
 
02:32:21.070 --> 02:32:21.080 align:start position:0%
but we have actually been able to
 
02:32:23.550 --> 02:32:23.560 align:start position:0%
streamline and add some resources in our
 
02:32:25.990 --> 02:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
admissions office and so we're seeing a
 
02:32:29.790 --> 02:32:29.800 align:start position:0%
3 to six month uh process instead of
 
02:32:32.750 --> 02:32:32.760 align:start position:0%
year or plus uh we actually are now
 
02:32:34.269 --> 02:32:34.279 align:start position:0%
experiencing where it's moving so
 
02:32:36.030 --> 02:32:36.040 align:start position:0%
quickly some families say oh we just did
 
02:32:38.670 --> 02:32:38.680 align:start position:0%
it in case we needed it um so we have
 
02:32:39.990 --> 02:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
some people waiting on our wait list
 
02:32:41.510 --> 02:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
that are just waiting for the right
 
02:32:44.030 --> 02:32:44.040 align:start position:0%
moment and then we have we are working
 
02:32:46.469 --> 02:32:46.479 align:start position:0%
on uh really building up our rehab
 
02:32:48.309 --> 02:32:48.319 align:start position:0%
department and we have now a full-time
 
02:32:49.870 --> 02:32:49.880 align:start position:0%
physical therapist and we're working on
 
02:32:51.590 --> 02:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
on taking a position that we weren't
 
02:32:53.030 --> 02:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
using and reclassing that to an
 
02:32:55.429 --> 02:32:55.439 align:start position:0%
occupational therapist you'll see some
 
02:32:57.469 --> 02:32:57.479 align:start position:0%
of our challenges and achievements and
 
02:33:00.150 --> 02:33:00.160 align:start position:0%
again our staffing is is big the biggest
 
02:33:02.990 --> 02:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
issue we have an overall vacancy rate at
 
02:33:05.070 --> 02:33:05.080 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Veterans Home of
 
02:33:05.080 --> 02:33:06.150 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Veterans Home of
almost

02:33:06.150 --> 02:33:06.160 align:start position:0%
almost
 
02:33:08.830 --> 02:33:08.840 align:start position:0%
35% some of those are purposeful because
 
02:33:11.230 --> 02:33:11.240 align:start position:0%
we're not at our full census so we
 
02:33:13.550 --> 02:33:13.560 align:start position:0%
should not have all of the staff if we
 
02:33:15.790 --> 02:33:15.800 align:start position:0%
don't have the full census but it's a
 
02:33:18.309 --> 02:33:18.319 align:start position:0%
catch 22 if we had more staff we could
 
02:33:20.710 --> 02:33:20.720 align:start position:0%
have more residents um right now our
 
02:33:24.309 --> 02:33:24.319 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate for lnas is about
 
02:33:28.750 --> 02:33:28.760 align:start position:0%
41.7% and our nurses is almost 40% um so
 
02:33:30.910 --> 02:33:30.920 align:start position:0%
we're seeing that as really been a tough
 
02:33:33.590 --> 02:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
piece there is just so many resources in
 
02:33:35.990 --> 02:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
the private sector to offer sign on
 
02:33:38.790 --> 02:33:38.800 align:start position:0%
bonuses uh bonus monies if you work so
 
02:33:41.670 --> 02:33:41.680 align:start position:0%
many shifts or uh just a higher rate of
 
02:33:43.349 --> 02:33:43.359 align:start position:0%
pay and we can't do that we don't have
 
02:33:45.990 --> 02:33:46.000 align:start position:0%
those options as a state
 
02:33:48.510 --> 02:33:48.520 align:start position:0%
employer uh right now we're we're trying
 
02:33:50.389 --> 02:33:50.399 align:start position:0%
to we're going to have to cap our
 
02:33:54.190 --> 02:33:54.200 align:start position:0%
resident um census at 150 to meet the
 
02:33:57.030 --> 02:33:57.040 align:start position:0%
need of the veterans and do that well
 
02:33:58.469 --> 02:33:58.479 align:start position:0%
it's it's something really important to
 
02:34:00.309 --> 02:34:00.319 align:start position:0%
us can I fill the beds yes I can fill
 
02:34:02.910 --> 02:34:02.920 align:start position:0%
225 beds but the quality of care would
 
02:34:04.389 --> 02:34:04.399 align:start position:0%
be horrible and we're just not willing
 
02:34:06.790 --> 02:34:06.800 align:start position:0%
to move on that quality of care for our
 
02:34:09.510 --> 02:34:09.520 align:start position:0%
veterans um so we're trying to still go
 
02:34:12.510 --> 02:34:12.520 align:start position:0%
to job fairs um be on uh different
 
02:34:15.670 --> 02:34:15.680 align:start position:0%
platforms like handshake for colleges uh
 
02:34:18.389 --> 02:34:18.399 align:start position:0%
local newspapers uh Word of Mouth we
 
02:34:20.070 --> 02:34:20.080 align:start position:0%
have Consolidated some of our our
 
02:34:22.590 --> 02:34:22.600 align:start position:0%
departments or uh neighborhoods that had
 
02:34:24.670 --> 02:34:24.680 align:start position:0%
some residents here some here we put
 
02:34:26.870 --> 02:34:26.880 align:start position:0%
them on one uh neighborhood so that we
 
02:34:28.830 --> 02:34:28.840 align:start position:0%
can consolidate our staff we're
 
02:34:30.750 --> 02:34:30.760 align:start position:0%
expanding our light duty in the past we
 
02:34:32.790 --> 02:34:32.800 align:start position:0%
haven't let people come back light duty
 
02:34:35.110 --> 02:34:35.120 align:start position:0%
if they weren't fully D fully ready to
 
02:34:37.150 --> 02:34:37.160 align:start position:0%
come back we would ask them to sit out
 
02:34:39.630 --> 02:34:39.640 align:start position:0%
now we know that we can do other things
 
02:34:42.309 --> 02:34:42.319 align:start position:0%
um we do mandating we have increased our
 
02:34:44.630 --> 02:34:44.640 align:start position:0%
volunteer opportunities and we're adding
 
02:34:47.469 --> 02:34:47.479 align:start position:0%
a learning uh system which will offer
 
02:34:49.710 --> 02:34:49.720 align:start position:0%
continuous educational opportunities for
 
02:34:51.429 --> 02:34:51.439 align:start position:0%
people who have licenses and that sounds
 
02:34:53.550 --> 02:34:53.560 align:start position:0%
like a small thing but if you have to
 
02:34:57.190 --> 02:34:57.200 align:start position:0%
maintain 40 cus every 2 years and we can
 
02:34:59.830 --> 02:34:59.840 align:start position:0%
offer that on the site at work and
 
02:35:01.389 --> 02:35:01.399 align:start position:0%
there's no cost we know that that will
 
02:35:03.389 --> 02:35:03.399 align:start position:0%
be a recruitment benefit for
 
02:35:07.389 --> 02:35:07.399 align:start position:0%
us uh strategic key strategic priorities
 
02:35:09.309 --> 02:35:09.319 align:start position:0%
continue to grow our resident C uh
 
02:35:12.030 --> 02:35:12.040 align:start position:0%
census reduce our number of State uh
 
02:35:14.830 --> 02:35:14.840 align:start position:0%
vacant staff positions meet the VA
 
02:35:16.469 --> 02:35:16.479 align:start position:0%
requirements we have to do that every
 
02:35:18.389 --> 02:35:18.399 align:start position:0%
April they come out and they uh do a
 
02:35:21.230 --> 02:35:21.240 align:start position:0%
full survey um really address some of
 
02:35:23.830 --> 02:35:23.840 align:start position:0%
our life safety initiatives we need to
 
02:35:26.389 --> 02:35:26.399 align:start position:0%
upgrade Vehicles we have one that one of
 
02:35:27.750 --> 02:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
the residents told me is embarrassed to
 
02:35:31.070 --> 02:35:31.080 align:start position:0%
get in because it's so Rusty uh we're
 
02:35:33.190 --> 02:35:33.200 align:start position:0%
replacing those Vehicles as we can with
 
02:35:35.389 --> 02:35:35.399 align:start position:0%
the budget that we have uh it
 
02:35:37.150 --> 02:35:37.160 align:start position:0%
infastructure that I spoke about
 
02:35:39.830 --> 02:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
building maintenance and and we have a
 
02:35:42.550 --> 02:35:42.560 align:start position:0%
new addition that will be going uh it's
 
02:35:44.269 --> 02:35:44.279 align:start position:0%
out to bid right now we're hoping that
 
02:35:46.630 --> 02:35:46.640 align:start position:0%
we will be breaking ground in the uh
 
02:35:49.269 --> 02:35:49.279 align:start position:0%
summer months that is money that was a
 
02:35:52.230 --> 02:35:52.240 align:start position:0%
lot of from the state in 2016 and we
 
02:35:54.590 --> 02:35:54.600 align:start position:0%
were waiting for the federal portion to
 
02:35:56.990 --> 02:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
be approved which they approved uh last
 
02:36:00.309 --> 02:36:00.319 align:start position:0%
year so we are working on a 20 bed
 
02:36:02.550 --> 02:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
private bathroom with nine of those
 
02:36:04.830 --> 02:36:04.840 align:start position:0%
rooms being bariatric and just giving
 
02:36:06.309 --> 02:36:06.319 align:start position:0%
them a better quality of life and
 
02:36:08.950 --> 02:36:08.960 align:start position:0%
infection prevention instead of four
 
02:36:11.510 --> 02:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
people sharing one bathroom it's just
 
02:36:13.670 --> 02:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
not the best quality and I think that
 
02:36:15.469 --> 02:36:15.479 align:start position:0%
most of our veterans have probably done
 
02:36:17.190 --> 02:36:17.200 align:start position:0%
all of the community living they want to
 
02:36:19.030 --> 02:36:19.040 align:start position:0%
do as they went through basic and in the
 
02:36:22.349 --> 02:36:22.359 align:start position:0%
military so um again 20 we're licensed
 
02:36:24.670 --> 02:36:24.680 align:start position:0%
for 250 beds budgeted for
 
02:36:28.269 --> 02:36:28.279 align:start position:0%
225 as of the 15th we have 13 people on
 
02:36:30.670 --> 02:36:30.680 align:start position:0%
our wait list that have been approved uh
 
02:36:32.950 --> 02:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
with four of those already having beds
 
02:36:36.150 --> 02:36:36.160 align:start position:0%
offers over the next few weeks and um so
 
02:36:38.269 --> 02:36:38.279 align:start position:0%
this is a really small number than what
 
02:36:40.110 --> 02:36:40.120 align:start position:0%
we used to see we had a huge number
 
02:36:42.429 --> 02:36:42.439 align:start position:0%
previously and we have 30 applications
 
02:36:44.830 --> 02:36:44.840 align:start position:0%
in process so that may be from day one
 
02:36:46.670 --> 02:36:46.680 align:start position:0%
or were they're getting medical
 
02:36:48.830 --> 02:36:48.840 align:start position:0%
information um we're getting their
 
02:36:51.550 --> 02:36:51.560 align:start position:0%
financial information whatever that is
 
02:36:53.950 --> 02:36:53.960 align:start position:0%
um so we are confident that we could
 
02:36:56.150 --> 02:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
definitely fill 225 if I can get the
 
02:36:58.750 --> 02:36:58.760 align:start position:0%
staff there because a lot of people who
 
02:37:01.510 --> 02:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
have to go to a placement of a nursing
 
02:37:04.070 --> 02:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
home level placement they sometimes wait
 
02:37:05.790 --> 02:37:05.800 align:start position:0%
to the point where it's in crisis so
 
02:37:07.830 --> 02:37:07.840 align:start position:0%
they have to go to other facilities in
 
02:37:09.510 --> 02:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
the community and then switch over to us
 
02:37:11.550 --> 02:37:11.560 align:start position:0%
but our goal is to just be able to have
 
02:37:14.230 --> 02:37:14.240 align:start position:0%
an open list you qualify you did all the
 
02:37:16.670 --> 02:37:16.680 align:start position:0%
work we're going to uh offer you a bed
 
02:37:19.910 --> 02:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
that's our goal um this was as of uh the
 
02:37:24.230 --> 02:37:24.240 align:start position:0%
15th we had 133 residents 123 men 10
 
02:37:26.750 --> 02:37:26.760 align:start position:0%
women I will tell you yesterday we had a
 
02:37:29.070 --> 02:37:29.080 align:start position:0%
final salute which um we spoke a little
 
02:37:31.670 --> 02:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
bit about that is a a ceremony that's
 
02:37:34.190 --> 02:37:34.200 align:start position:0%
held at our facility uh if you are
 
02:37:36.710 --> 02:37:36.720 align:start position:0%
coming in our front door as a veteran
 
02:37:38.550 --> 02:37:38.560 align:start position:0%
you are going to go out our front door
 
02:37:41.590 --> 02:37:41.600 align:start position:0%
not at a loading dock or something uh
 
02:37:43.790 --> 02:37:43.800 align:start position:0%
that's secretive they the person who
 
02:37:45.790 --> 02:37:45.800 align:start position:0%
lived with us is part of our family and
 
02:37:48.590 --> 02:37:48.600 align:start position:0%
we need that closure so um yesterday we
 
02:37:50.030 --> 02:37:50.040 align:start position:0%
did have a final
 
02:37:52.510 --> 02:37:52.520 align:start position:0%
salute happening at the same time in the
 
02:37:54.670 --> 02:37:54.680 align:start position:0%
Next Room we were celebrating a 100th
 
02:37:58.110 --> 02:37:58.120 align:start position:0%
birthday um of a uh member of our our
 
02:38:02.349 --> 02:38:02.359 align:start position:0%
family so uh the average age is about 83
 
02:38:04.590 --> 02:38:04.600 align:start position:0%
years old and you'll see the census
 
02:38:07.190 --> 02:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
graph here shows we were pretty high up
 
02:38:10.670 --> 02:38:10.680 align:start position:0%
before uh the covid and now we're just
 
02:38:12.429 --> 02:38:12.439 align:start position:0%
struggling to get back up to where we
 
02:38:14.349 --> 02:38:14.359 align:start position:0%
were prior to covid which I think a lot
 
02:38:16.230 --> 02:38:16.240 align:start position:0%
of healthcare facilities are doing as
 
02:38:18.630 --> 02:38:18.640 align:start position:0%
well I always talk a little bit about
 
02:38:20.990 --> 02:38:21.000 align:start position:0%
the branch of military Ser uh service
 
02:38:22.870 --> 02:38:22.880 align:start position:0%
because because it's a topic at our
 
02:38:27.150 --> 02:38:27.160 align:start position:0%
facility um so the Army is 56 residents
 
02:38:30.110 --> 02:38:30.120 align:start position:0%
uh the Navy falls behind them at 39 the
 
02:38:33.830 --> 02:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
Air Force is at 24 the Marines are at 8
 
02:38:35.550 --> 02:38:35.560 align:start position:0%
which I've been told by marines that you
 
02:38:39.790 --> 02:38:39.800 align:start position:0%
only need one um and National Guard is
 
02:38:42.349 --> 02:38:42.359 align:start position:0%
three National Guard is three and the
 
02:38:45.510 --> 02:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
Coast Guard are three as well um so then
 
02:38:48.469 --> 02:38:48.479 align:start position:0%
we have the conflict era we're seeing um
 
02:38:50.670 --> 02:38:50.680 align:start position:0%
a lot of our veterans right now are
 
02:38:54.830 --> 02:38:54.840 align:start position:0%
Vietnam era uh we have five World War II
 
02:38:58.710 --> 02:38:58.720 align:start position:0%
veterans still with us um and um but
 
02:39:01.190 --> 02:39:01.200 align:start position:0%
we're seeing that larger pool we do have
 
02:39:03.230 --> 02:39:03.240 align:start position:0%
a very young resident who is a golf War
 
02:39:06.190 --> 02:39:06.200 align:start position:0%
veteran as well she is uh 64 years old
 
02:39:07.830 --> 02:39:07.840 align:start position:0%
she's our youngest
 
02:39:10.309 --> 02:39:10.319 align:start position:0%
resident revenue streams which is really
 
02:39:11.870 --> 02:39:11.880 align:start position:0%
important for people who are saying how
 
02:39:15.150 --> 02:39:15.160 align:start position:0%
do you get how do we pay for this um so
 
02:39:17.630 --> 02:39:17.640 align:start position:0%
uh you'll see the graph here the federal
 
02:39:22.910 --> 02:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
funds um from the um VA pays for a p uh
 
02:39:24.910 --> 02:39:24.920 align:start position:0%
portion of that it depends on your
 
02:39:27.070 --> 02:39:27.080 align:start position:0%
disability rating to how much they pay
 
02:39:30.469 --> 02:39:30.479 align:start position:0%
so if you're over 70% disabled through
 
02:39:32.710 --> 02:39:32.720 align:start position:0%
the VA they're going to pay us what's
 
02:39:36.750 --> 02:39:36.760 align:start position:0%
called um a prevailing rate and that is
 
02:39:41.590 --> 02:39:41.600 align:start position:0%
$587 120 a day if you are under that 70%
 
02:39:44.030 --> 02:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
Watermark then it is a basic rate
 
02:39:46.269 --> 02:39:46.279 align:start position:0%
payment and that's
 
02:39:50.269 --> 02:39:50.279 align:start position:0%
$144 a day right now we have six
 
02:39:54.070 --> 02:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
veterans who are over that 70% or higher
 
02:39:56.910 --> 02:39:56.920 align:start position:0%
the other uh way we are paid is the
 
02:39:59.150 --> 02:39:59.160 align:start position:0%
actual residents if they have resources
 
02:40:02.110 --> 02:40:02.120 align:start position:0%
over $30,000 they are U paying us a
 
02:40:04.190 --> 02:40:04.200 align:start position:0%
portion of that that until they've
 
02:40:07.309 --> 02:40:07.319 align:start position:0%
reached their 30,000 um and then the
 
02:40:09.870 --> 02:40:09.880 align:start position:0%
rest is General funds which we are lucky
 
02:40:12.030 --> 02:40:12.040 align:start position:0%
that we have that to fall back on we're
 
02:40:14.670 --> 02:40:14.680 align:start position:0%
very aware that these are important
 
02:40:16.550 --> 02:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
funds and how we spend our taxpayer
 
02:40:18.990 --> 02:40:19.000 align:start position:0%
dollars we will try to get everything we
 
02:40:21.309 --> 02:40:21.319 align:start position:0%
can out of everything like I mentioned
 
02:40:25.070 --> 02:40:25.080 align:start position:0%
the vehicle that is rust it's solid as
 
02:40:29.070 --> 02:40:29.080 align:start position:0%
far as a safety wise but it is Rusty um
 
02:40:33.670 --> 02:40:33.680 align:start position:0%
so right now our breakdown is um 46% are
 
02:40:36.870 --> 02:40:36.880 align:start position:0%
General funds 30 are federal funds and
 
02:40:40.830 --> 02:40:40.840 align:start position:0%
24% are from our rman board funds we
 
02:40:42.950 --> 02:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
have a few capital budget requests this
 
02:40:44.990 --> 02:40:45.000 align:start position:0%
year we need to replace some rooftop air
 
02:40:48.630 --> 02:40:48.640 align:start position:0%
handlers we need to replace um resident
 
02:40:51.950 --> 02:40:51.960 align:start position:0%
veteran uh tubs in a bariatric uh shower
 
02:40:54.670 --> 02:40:54.680 align:start position:0%
stretcher trolley we have very old
 
02:40:57.269 --> 02:40:57.279 align:start position:0%
elevators we have had a staff two staff
 
02:40:59.070 --> 02:40:59.080 align:start position:0%
members get stuck on an elevator and
 
02:41:01.110 --> 02:41:01.120 align:start position:0%
have to be pulled out um which is
 
02:41:03.830 --> 02:41:03.840 align:start position:0%
terrifying and uh so we need to update
 
02:41:06.269 --> 02:41:06.279 align:start position:0%
two of them and replace one and then we
 
02:41:08.590 --> 02:41:08.600 align:start position:0%
have some really old sections of our
 
02:41:11.309 --> 02:41:11.319 align:start position:0%
building building that are are not Ada
 
02:41:13.550 --> 02:41:13.560 align:start position:0%
requ uh they don't meet the ADA
 
02:41:15.710 --> 02:41:15.720 align:start position:0%
requirements and they also have really
 
02:41:18.110 --> 02:41:18.120 align:start position:0%
narrow doors so some of the wheelchairs
 
02:41:20.269 --> 02:41:20.279 align:start position:0%
literally can't fit in the doors so
 
02:41:22.429 --> 02:41:22.439 align:start position:0%
we've closed those units and tried to
 
02:41:24.190 --> 02:41:24.200 align:start position:0%
move to other units while we're waiting
 
02:41:26.750 --> 02:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
for some rehab dollars to at least uh
 
02:41:28.910 --> 02:41:28.920 align:start position:0%
widen those uh to accommodate the lar
 
02:41:28.920 --> 02:41:30.269 align:start position:0%
widen those uh to accommodate the lar
larger

02:41:30.269 --> 02:41:30.279 align:start position:0%
larger
 
02:41:32.469 --> 02:41:32.479 align:start position:0%
wheelchairs uh quality of life programs
 
02:41:34.469 --> 02:41:34.479 align:start position:0%
that Brian spoke a little bit about they
 
02:41:37.230 --> 02:41:37.240 align:start position:0%
are all supported all of the quality
 
02:41:38.870 --> 02:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
life residential activities are
 
02:41:41.790 --> 02:41:41.800 align:start position:0%
supported by the people behind us some
 
02:41:43.309 --> 02:41:43.319 align:start position:0%
of the people probably sitting at this
 
02:41:45.870 --> 02:41:45.880 align:start position:0%
table the veteran service organizations
 
02:41:49.550 --> 02:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
the community Christmas everybody uh
 
02:41:51.590 --> 02:41:51.600 align:start position:0%
comes out and they sponsor of Veteran
 
02:41:54.550 --> 02:41:54.560 align:start position:0%
for Christmas gifts uh they go to uh
 
02:41:56.830 --> 02:41:56.840 align:start position:0%
sporting events they do the things that
 
02:41:58.510 --> 02:41:58.520 align:start position:0%

02:42:00.230 --> 02:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
we go to shows we go to things that we

want to do and they are treated so well
 
02:42:05.790 --> 02:42:05.800 align:start position:0%
they go to the air show uh in Portsmith
 
02:42:08.309 --> 02:42:08.319 align:start position:0%
and they are um asked to come during
 
02:42:10.950 --> 02:42:10.960 align:start position:0%

02:43:26.750 --> 02:43:26.760 align:start position:0%
representative gagy Mr chairman with
 
02:43:30.830 --> 02:43:30.840 align:start position:0%
your uh permission I've got a couple not
 
02:43:34.670 --> 02:43:34.680 align:start position:0%
too many but a couple uh getting back to
 
02:43:39.670 --> 02:43:39.680 align:start position:0%
the uh the staff yes uh how are the
 
02:43:42.950 --> 02:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
wages are they competitive for the area
 
02:43:44.910 --> 02:43:44.920 align:start position:0%
they're it's so tough because I know the
 
02:43:46.309 --> 02:43:46.319 align:start position:0%
governor is probably watching me too
 
02:43:49.190 --> 02:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
right now um they're better with the
 
02:43:51.590 --> 02:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
raises that we experienced over the last
 
02:43:54.950 --> 02:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
two years um however what happens is
 
02:43:58.630 --> 02:43:58.640 align:start position:0%
when we become somewhat equal to the
 
02:44:00.670 --> 02:44:00.680 align:start position:0%
private sector the private sector has
 
02:44:02.070 --> 02:44:02.080 align:start position:0%
the ability just to increase the
 
02:44:05.110 --> 02:44:05.120 align:start position:0%
salaries so right now we're seeing a lot
 
02:44:07.590 --> 02:44:07.600 align:start position:0%
of loss of uh licensed nursing
 
02:44:10.550 --> 02:44:10.560 align:start position:0%
assistance to contract companies private
 
02:44:12.870 --> 02:44:12.880 align:start position:0%
companies that do contract and they're
 
02:44:15.870 --> 02:44:15.880 align:start position:0%
paying quite a bit more than we are we
 
02:44:19.590 --> 02:44:19.600 align:start position:0%
uh are dietary and our laundry workers
 
02:44:22.309 --> 02:44:22.319 align:start position:0%
are some of the lowest paid um how how
 
02:44:25.790 --> 02:44:25.800 align:start position:0%
much is it hourly so typically laundry
 
02:44:27.950 --> 02:44:27.960 align:start position:0%
and dietary we start around between 12
 
02:44:30.429 --> 02:44:30.439 align:start position:0%
and $14 an hour which which is tough to
 
02:44:33.550 --> 02:44:33.560 align:start position:0%
recruit when and I don't want to put any
 
02:44:34.870 --> 02:44:34.880 align:start position:0%
uh facility down but they could
 
02:44:37.190 --> 02:44:37.200 align:start position:0%
literally go to McDonald's and make five
 
02:44:39.590 --> 02:44:39.600 align:start position:0%
to $6 dollar more an hour for for a lot
 
02:44:42.349 --> 02:44:42.359 align:start position:0%
less work for Burger flippers right so
 
02:44:44.670 --> 02:44:44.680 align:start position:0%
it is it's been tough they were somewhat
 
02:44:47.150 --> 02:44:47.160 align:start position:0%
better um but they're we getting outm
 
02:44:50.830 --> 02:44:50.840 align:start position:0%
marketed again well follow up follow up
 
02:44:52.670 --> 02:44:52.680 align:start position:0%
my second question would be uh we're
 
02:44:55.990 --> 02:44:56.000 align:start position:0%
getting back to the LNA question is that
 
02:44:58.710 --> 02:44:58.720 align:start position:0%
in-house teaching yes so we have staff
 
02:45:01.269 --> 02:45:01.279 align:start position:0%
that um teach the LNA program and then
 
02:45:02.830 --> 02:45:02.840 align:start position:0%
we have the state comes and does the
 
02:45:05.790 --> 02:45:05.800 align:start position:0%
testing to uh test them and then once
 
02:45:07.790 --> 02:45:07.800 align:start position:0%
they pass they can be licensed do the
 
02:45:10.590 --> 02:45:10.600 align:start position:0%
lnas pay for that or is it or is it paid
 
02:45:13.510 --> 02:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
for by for them it's it we pay for it
 
02:45:15.830 --> 02:45:15.840 align:start position:0%
with a commitment so they have to commit
 
02:45:19.030 --> 02:45:19.040 align:start position:0%
to us um 12 uh excuse me I wish I could
 
02:45:21.590 --> 02:45:21.600 align:start position:0%
say 12 years I want to say 12 12 months
 
02:45:24.550 --> 02:45:24.560 align:start position:0%
or the equivalent of a full-time 280
 
02:45:27.070 --> 02:45:27.080 align:start position:0%
hours so what happens is if they leave
 
02:45:28.429 --> 02:45:28.439 align:start position:0%
and they choose to leave before that
 
02:45:30.710 --> 02:45:30.720 align:start position:0%
commitment is done then it's pro-rated
 
02:45:32.830 --> 02:45:32.840 align:start position:0%
and they must pay that back to the to
 
02:45:34.950 --> 02:45:34.960 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire um the
 
02:45:36.910 --> 02:45:36.920 align:start position:0%
majority of time people stay for the
 
02:45:39.590 --> 02:45:39.600 align:start position:0%
whole time and then they may leave again
 
02:45:40.870 --> 02:45:40.880 align:start position:0%
to go somewhere else where they're
 
02:45:44.550 --> 02:45:44.560 align:start position:0%
getting offered a lot more money thank
 
02:45:48.990 --> 02:45:49.000 align:start position:0%
you R manal bomb thank you Mr chairman
 
02:45:50.950 --> 02:45:50.960 align:start position:0%
so I'm looking at your census and
 
02:45:53.670 --> 02:45:53.680 align:start position:0%
certainly we know that the co pandemic
 
02:45:56.590 --> 02:45:56.600 align:start position:0%
disrupted nearly everything um but
 
02:46:00.030 --> 02:46:00.040 align:start position:0%
between 2020 and 2021 there's a decrease
 
02:46:02.670 --> 02:46:02.680 align:start position:0%
of nearly 70 residents yes and I'm
 
02:46:04.710 --> 02:46:04.720 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could explain more
 
02:46:07.309 --> 02:46:07.319 align:start position:0%
specifically why that was your resident
 
02:46:09.630 --> 02:46:09.640 align:start position:0%
leaving or an unfortunately High
 
02:46:12.510 --> 02:46:12.520 align:start position:0%
mortality rate yes so it was um it was
 
02:46:15.750 --> 02:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
before me um so I know that both Paul
 
02:46:17.990 --> 02:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
Lloyd and Brian were there on the front
 
02:46:20.750 --> 02:46:20.760 align:start position:0%
lines with that uh that was covid uh
 
02:46:23.429 --> 02:46:23.439 align:start position:0%
there was a huge loss of veterans at the
 
02:46:25.790 --> 02:46:25.800 align:start position:0%
facility before the vaccine was
 
02:46:29.030 --> 02:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
available uh early on they made it quite
 
02:46:31.870 --> 02:46:31.880 align:start position:0%
a while um right before the vaccine came
 
02:46:34.590 --> 02:46:34.600 align:start position:0%
before the co had actually uh entered
 
02:46:36.710 --> 02:46:36.720 align:start position:0%
the facility so you see a big drop there
 
02:46:38.389 --> 02:46:38.399 align:start position:0%
related to the covid and we've been
 
02:46:40.550 --> 02:46:40.560 align:start position:0%
struggling to get up there again with
 
02:46:43.070 --> 02:46:43.080 align:start position:0%
the average age of 83 we do lose a lot
 
02:46:44.910 --> 02:46:44.920 align:start position:0%
of people so this number looks like it's
 
02:46:47.110 --> 02:46:47.120 align:start position:0%
stayed the same but that's a lot of
 
02:46:49.349 --> 02:46:49.359 align:start position:0%
residents who have come in and gone out
 
02:46:51.469 --> 02:46:51.479 align:start position:0%
um and uh but that's that's the
 
02:46:53.190 --> 02:46:53.200 align:start position:0%
explanation that all right thank you
 
02:46:56.830 --> 02:46:56.840 align:start position:0%
you're welcome anything
 
02:47:00.030 --> 02:47:00.040 align:start position:0%
else um coming on hopefully the eight
 
02:47:02.710 --> 02:47:02.720 align:start position:0%
Marines are working out staying in shape
 
02:47:05.150 --> 02:47:05.160 align:start position:0%
and staying out of trouble uh I don't oh
 
02:47:06.150 --> 02:47:06.160 align:start position:0%
I don't know about staying in that
 
02:47:06.160 --> 02:47:07.590 align:start position:0%
I don't know about staying in that
trouble

02:47:07.590 --> 02:47:07.600 align:start position:0%
trouble
 
02:47:10.269 --> 02:47:10.279 align:start position:0%

are 140 applicants to host the wall
 
02:53:59.229 --> 02:53:59.239 align:start position:0%
Claremont being one the wall has only
 
02:54:01.750 --> 02:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
been in New Hampshire four times in its
 
02:54:04.750 --> 02:54:04.760 align:start position:0%

with that all right here's Les remember
 
02:54:39.790 --> 02:54:39.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:43.150 --> 02:54:43.160 align:start position:0%
veteran thank you Mr chairman and all
 
02:54:46.110 --> 02:54:46.120 align:start position:0%
our state representatives Le St Pierre
 
02:54:50.309 --> 02:54:50.319 align:start position:0%
Vietnam veteran uh few years ago bill
 
02:54:54.469 --> 02:54:54.479 align:start position:0%
came up with an idea to uh recognize the
 
02:54:57.550 --> 02:54:57.560 align:start position:0%
misas that have been identified so
 
02:55:00.670 --> 02:55:00.680 align:start position:0%
monthly at our meeting I go through
 
02:55:04.190 --> 02:55:04.200 align:start position:0%
during the month and put together a list
 
02:55:07.190 --> 02:55:07.200 align:start position:0%
of M that have been identified the
 
02:55:07.200 --> 02:55:08.670 align:start position:0%
of M that have been identified the
identification

02:55:08.670 --> 02:55:08.680 align:start position:0%
identification
 
02:55:12.630 --> 02:55:12.640 align:start position:0%
process is achieved through the dpaa
 
02:55:15.590 --> 02:55:15.600 align:start position:0%
which is the defense P Mia accounting
 
02:55:19.510 --> 02:55:19.520 align:start position:0%
agency which was established in uh 2015
 
02:55:21.670 --> 02:55:21.680 align:start position:0%
prior to that there were four other
 
02:55:25.750 --> 02:55:25.760 align:start position:0%
organizations with this project and all
 
02:55:30.950 --> 02:55:30.960 align:start position:0%
it did was tread water so in 1973 from
 
02:55:33.030 --> 02:55:33.040 align:start position:0%
World War II there were
 
02:55:33.040 --> 02:55:36.990 align:start position:0%
World War II there were
73,74

02:55:36.990 --> 02:55:37.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:41.429 --> 02:55:41.439 align:start position:0%
Mias from World War II they're now
 
02:55:45.030 --> 02:55:45.040 align:start position:0%
71,9 186 so we have identified from
 
02:55:48.990 --> 02:55:49.000 align:start position:0%
World War II 169
 
02:55:49.000 --> 02:55:50.550 align:start position:0%
World War II 169
one

02:55:50.550 --> 02:55:50.560 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:55:56.349 --> 02:55:56.359 align:start position:0%
Mias Korea there's been was
 
02:56:01.510 --> 02:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:04.429 --> 02:56:04.439 align:start position:0%
7,446 that's 711
 
02:56:07.349 --> 02:56:07.359 align:start position:0%
Korean veterans have been
 
02:56:11.110 --> 02:56:11.120 align:start position:0%
repatriated Vietnam there was
 
02:56:13.670 --> 02:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
2,634 we are down
 
02:56:13.680 --> 02:56:15.950 align:start position:0%
2,634 we are down
to

02:56:15.950 --> 02:56:15.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:56:20.349 --> 02:56:20.359 align:start position:0%
1,573 so we have identified Vietnam
 
02:56:20.359 --> 02:56:22.190 align:start position:0%
1,573 so we have identified Vietnam
1,61

02:56:22.190 --> 02:56:22.200 align:start position:0%
1,61
 
02:56:25.269 --> 02:56:25.279 align:start position:0%
members the Cold War which lasted from
 
02:56:27.910 --> 02:56:27.920 align:start position:0%
1945 through
 
02:56:31.830 --> 02:56:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:31.840 --> 02:56:34.349 align:start position:0%
 
128

02:56:34.349 --> 02:56:34.359 align:start position:0%
128
 
02:56:39.150 --> 02:56:39.160 align:start position:0%
Mias they have accounted for 126 from
 
02:56:42.510 --> 02:56:42.520 align:start position:0%
the Cold War we are down to only two Mia
 
02:56:46.110 --> 02:56:46.120 align:start position:0%
from the Cold War the gulf Wars in
 
02:56:49.990 --> 02:56:50.000 align:start position:0%
Libya there were six Mias all six of
 
02:56:51.190 --> 02:56:51.200 align:start position:0%
those have been
 
02:56:55.229 --> 02:56:55.239 align:start position:0%
identified a highlight was in September
 
02:56:59.710 --> 02:56:59.720 align:start position:0%
the 700 Mia from Korea was ided it's a
 
02:57:01.150 --> 02:57:01.160 align:start position:0%
long slow
 
02:57:05.190 --> 02:57:05.200 align:start position:0%
process to ID uh some of the IDS take
 
02:57:06.910 --> 02:57:06.920 align:start position:0%
two to three years once they start
 
02:57:08.030 --> 02:57:08.040 align:start position:0%
working on
 
02:57:12.710 --> 02:57:12.720 align:start position:0%
it uh New Hampshire itself has 319
 
02:57:17.110 --> 02:57:17.120 align:start position:0%
Mias 273 are from World War II we have
 
02:57:19.030 --> 02:57:19.040 align:start position:0%
40 from Korea
 
02:57:21.750 --> 02:57:21.760 align:start position:0%
and we still have six from Vietnam it's
 
02:57:24.790 --> 02:57:24.800 align:start position:0%
a long slow slow
 
02:57:28.229 --> 02:57:28.239 align:start position:0%
process uh it's had most of these have
 
02:57:32.190 --> 02:57:32.200 align:start position:0%
come through a lot of work uh they have
 
02:57:35.910 --> 02:57:35.920 align:start position:0%
to get approvals from they first they
 
02:57:38.190 --> 02:57:38.200 align:start position:0%
have to find sites where
 
02:57:42.469 --> 02:57:42.479 align:start position:0%
these individuals might be uh then once
 
02:57:45.070 --> 02:57:45.080 align:start position:0%
they get orientation of where these
 
02:57:48.910 --> 02:57:48.920 align:start position:0%
sites are they have to go through
 
02:57:52.190 --> 02:57:52.200 align:start position:0%
the governments of that country where
 
02:57:57.269 --> 02:57:57.279 align:start position:0%
they are get permission to uh search the
 
02:58:01.750 --> 02:58:01.760 align:start position:0%
areas so it's a it's a process that's AP
 
02:58:05.590 --> 02:58:05.600 align:start position:0%
to Take 5 10 years sometimes but it's a
 
02:58:08.229 --> 02:58:08.239 align:start position:0%
slow process and we're proud that
 
02:58:10.269 --> 02:58:10.279 align:start position:0%
Rolling Thunder that we're supporting
 
02:58:14.710 --> 02:58:14.720 align:start position:0%
this all the way through to identify our
 
02:58:18.469 --> 02:58:18.479 align:start position:0%
Mias it's uh I got a whole bunch of
 
02:58:21.309 --> 02:58:21.319 align:start position:0%
cards here but I can't go through them
 
02:58:23.870 --> 02:58:23.880 align:start position:0%
all uh one of the things they have
 
02:58:27.469 --> 02:58:27.479 align:start position:0%
accomplished was from uh World War II
 
02:58:28.790 --> 02:58:28.800 align:start position:0%
the USS
 
02:58:31.309 --> 02:58:31.319 align:start position:0%
Oklahoma when that was
 
02:58:35.910 --> 02:58:35.920 align:start position:0%
a attack during Pearl Hab day October
 
02:58:39.070 --> 02:58:39.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:41.429 --> 02:58:41.439 align:start position:0%
1941 there was
 
02:58:46.910 --> 02:58:46.920 align:start position:0%
429 Sailors killed on that on that ship
 
02:58:50.630 --> 02:58:50.640 align:start position:0%
through 194 47 they were able to
 
02:58:50.640 --> 02:58:52.110 align:start position:0%
through 194 47 they were able to
identify

02:58:52.110 --> 02:58:52.120 align:start position:0%
identify
 
02:58:54.790 --> 02:58:54.800 align:start position:0%
35 that left
 
02:58:58.950 --> 02:58:58.960 align:start position:0%
394 individuals unable to be
 
02:59:01.309 --> 02:59:01.319 align:start position:0%
identified they were buried in Mass
 
02:59:04.150 --> 02:59:04.160 align:start position:0%
Graves throughout
 
02:59:07.150 --> 02:59:07.160 align:start position:0%
Hawaii uh and they start exhuming they
 
02:59:09.070 --> 02:59:09.080 align:start position:0%
exhumed them in
 
02:59:09.080 --> 02:59:10.830 align:start position:0%
exhumed them in
19

02:59:10.830 --> 02:59:10.840 align:start position:0%
19
 
02:59:14.910 --> 02:59:14.920 align:start position:0%
57 they started and they were reburied
 
02:59:19.070 --> 02:59:19.080 align:start position:0%
again and in 197
 
02:59:21.830 --> 02:59:21.840 align:start position:0%
five they started the whole process all
 
02:59:21.840 --> 02:59:22.670 align:start position:0%
five they started the whole process all
over

02:59:22.670 --> 02:59:22.680 align:start position:0%
over
 
02:59:27.349 --> 02:59:27.359 align:start position:0%
again since that time since 2015 since
 
02:59:29.110 --> 02:59:29.120 align:start position:0%
the dpaa took
 
02:59:32.349 --> 02:59:32.359 align:start position:0%
over they have now
 
02:59:36.429 --> 02:59:36.439 align:start position:0%
identified everyone from the USS
 
02:59:40.790 --> 02:59:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:43.030 --> 02:59:43.040 align:start position:0%
identifications due the fact they had no
 
02:59:46.710 --> 02:59:46.720 align:start position:0%
DNA or ways to identify the bodies they
 
02:59:50.830 --> 02:59:50.840 align:start position:0%
have done a Mass grave of just
 
02:59:53.670 --> 02:59:53.680 align:start position:0%
30 individuals that have not been able
 
02:59:56.229 --> 02:59:56.239 align:start position:0%
to be identified they know that they
 
02:59:58.590 --> 02:59:58.600 align:start position:0%
have their names and they were all
 
03:00:02.830 --> 03:00:02.840 align:start position:0%
buried together in one Mass grave but
 
03:00:06.229 --> 03:00:06.239 align:start position:0%
individually identified as
 
03:00:11.070 --> 03:00:11.080 align:start position:0%
unknown uh so the Mia thing will never
 
03:00:11.080 --> 03:00:11.950 align:start position:0%
unknown uh so the Mia thing will never
go

03:00:11.950 --> 03:00:11.960 align:start position:0%
go
 
03:00:15.349 --> 03:00:15.359 align:start position:0%
away uh most of the ones from World War
 
03:00:19.750 --> 03:00:19.760 align:start position:0%
II about 75% of those
 
03:00:23.790 --> 03:00:23.800 align:start position:0%
41,000 are going to be as unrecoverable
 
03:00:25.389 --> 03:00:25.399 align:start position:0%
because they went down at
 
03:00:25.399 --> 03:00:27.030 align:start position:0%
because they went down at
Sea

03:00:27.030 --> 03:00:27.040 align:start position:0%
Sea
 
03:00:31.790 --> 03:00:31.800 align:start position:0%
so forever our country will have
 
03:00:37.229 --> 03:00:37.239 align:start position:0%
masas uh for that fact other than that
 
03:00:37.239 --> 03:00:38.870 align:start position:0%
masas uh for that fact other than that
uh

03:00:38.870 --> 03:00:38.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:00:42.990 --> 03:00:43.000 align:start position:0%
it's it's something that uh we want to
 
03:00:46.309 --> 03:00:46.319 align:start position:0%
always keep in mind
 
03:00:49.190 --> 03:00:49.200 align:start position:0%
that family members
 
03:00:50.630 --> 03:00:50.640 align:start position:0%
never have
 
03:00:53.830 --> 03:00:53.840 align:start position:0%
closure because their loved ones are
 
03:00:57.070 --> 03:00:57.080 align:start position:0%
never going to be found but the good
 
03:01:00.229 --> 03:01:00.239 align:start position:0%
thing is that organizations keep it in
 
03:01:03.590 --> 03:01:03.600 align:start position:0%
the Forefront that we still consider
 
03:01:05.750 --> 03:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
them family and
 
03:01:09.030 --> 03:01:09.040 align:start position:0%
Mias and we're keeping the government
 
03:01:11.510 --> 03:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
accountable for
 
03:01:14.309 --> 03:01:14.319 align:start position:0%

War II and just never it's just
 
03:01:37.870 --> 03:01:37.880 align:start position:0%
something to ponder questions or
 
03:01:37.880 --> 03:01:38.910 align:start position:0%
something to ponder questions or
comments

03:01:38.910 --> 03:01:38.920 align:start position:0%
comments
 
03:01:40.790 --> 03:01:40.800 align:start position:0%
for the
 
03:01:42.950 --> 03:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
speakers uh represent
 
03:01:45.750 --> 03:01:45.760 align:start position:0%
Rollins yes thank you I notic I me heard
 
03:01:46.950 --> 03:01:46.960 align:start position:0%
you mention that you have some of the
 
03:01:48.870 --> 03:01:48.880 align:start position:0%
cards with you I know we read these at
 
03:01:51.229 --> 03:01:51.239 align:start position:0%
our meetings um for the sake for the
 
03:01:52.950 --> 03:01:52.960 align:start position:0%
committee to understand what we read
 
03:01:55.110 --> 03:01:55.120 align:start position:0%
what is on those cards do you have a say
 
03:01:56.950 --> 03:01:56.960 align:start position:0%
two of these cards that you could read
 
03:01:58.510 --> 03:01:58.520 align:start position:0%
so that I I didn't bring any of the
 
03:02:01.830 --> 03:02:01.840 align:start position:0%
cards with me uh when they're
 
03:02:05.469 --> 03:02:05.479 align:start position:0%
identified uh some of some of the sites
 
03:02:07.670 --> 03:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
I have to go to will just have their
 
03:02:10.309 --> 03:02:10.319 align:start position:0%
name and when they're
 
03:02:13.750 --> 03:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
identified but I put together the cards
 
03:02:18.110 --> 03:02:18.120 align:start position:0%
um I try to do the individual's name
 
03:02:20.229 --> 03:02:20.239 align:start position:0%
their age their
 
03:02:22.630 --> 03:02:22.640 align:start position:0%
Hometown where they served whether it be
 
03:02:26.670 --> 03:02:26.680 align:start position:0%
on a ship or whatever units they served
 
03:02:31.670 --> 03:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
with and possibly where they were uh Kia
 
03:02:33.910 --> 03:02:33.920 align:start position:0%
which killed in action I try to keep
 
03:02:37.790 --> 03:02:37.800 align:start position:0%
that on all the cards and an update of
 
03:02:40.269 --> 03:02:40.279 align:start position:0%
when and if they were buried whether
 
03:02:43.590 --> 03:02:43.600 align:start position:0%
they were buried at a national cemetery
 
03:02:47.910 --> 03:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
buried overseas or uh came home to be
 
03:02:51.309 --> 03:02:51.319 align:start position:0%
buried with their family uh so these
 
03:02:55.950 --> 03:02:55.960 align:start position:0%
cards uh I put them together 3x5 cards
 
03:02:58.790 --> 03:02:58.800 align:start position:0%
and we pass them around the room and a
 
03:03:00.190 --> 03:03:00.200 align:start position:0%
member will read
 
03:03:04.510 --> 03:03:04.520 align:start position:0%
it and I what gives
 
03:03:08.950 --> 03:03:08.960 align:start position:0%
uh feeling to that is saying the missing
 
03:03:11.750 --> 03:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
man's name man or
 
03:03:15.070 --> 03:03:15.080 align:start position:0%
lady saying the name
 
03:03:19.110 --> 03:03:19.120 align:start position:0%
brings the to Forefront of what the I is
 
03:03:24.429 --> 03:03:24.439 align:start position:0%
and so uh it's it's a good thing I I I
 
03:03:27.110 --> 03:03:27.120 align:start position:0%
enjoy doing it and like uh
 
03:03:29.510 --> 03:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
representative Rollins said he always
 
03:03:31.229 --> 03:03:31.239 align:start position:0%
when I pass the cards around he's always
 
03:03:33.750 --> 03:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
sure to grab at least one or two to read
 
03:03:37.070 --> 03:03:37.080 align:start position:0%
the names to highlight what our mission
 
03:03:40.950 --> 03:03:40.960 align:start position:0%
and what we're staying and around
 
03:03:43.469 --> 03:03:43.479 align:start position:0%
for maybe represent Rollins could bring
 
03:03:45.950 --> 03:03:45.960 align:start position:0%
a couple cards to uh some of our future
 
03:03:49.030 --> 03:03:49.040 align:start position:0%
sessions uh if there's no OB ction in um

registering for Selective Service with
 
04:03:21.750 --> 04:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
the federal government I have not found
 
04:03:23.790 --> 04:03:23.800 align:start position:0%
any information suggesting we are
 
04:03:25.950 --> 04:03:25.960 align:start position:0%
financially compensated for enforcing
 
04:03:28.469 --> 04:03:28.479 align:start position:0%
this unlike most other federal laws and
 
04:03:30.469 --> 04:03:30.479 align:start position:0%
programs that states cooperate with the
 
04:03:32.950 --> 04:03:32.960 align:start position:0%
feds in enforcing it should be noted
 
04:03:34.510 --> 04:03:34.520 align:start position:0%
there is no fiscal
 
04:03:37.389 --> 04:03:37.399 align:start position:0%
note in addition with regards to higher
 
04:03:40.790 --> 04:03:40.800 align:start position:0%
education as of 2025 the free
 
04:03:44.110 --> 04:03:44.120 align:start position:0%
application for federal student aid FSA
 
04:03:46.110 --> 04:03:46.120 align:start position:0%

04:03:47.910 --> 04:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
applicants be registered for the draft
 
04:03:50.269 --> 04:03:50.279 align:start position:0%
to apply for federal student
 
04:03:53.189 --> 04:03:53.199 align:start position:0%
loans as with many private sector
 
04:03:55.309 --> 04:03:55.319 align:start position:0%
Industries the state is having trouble
 
04:03:58.349 --> 04:03:58.359 align:start position:0%
filling many roles we have a bill right
 
04:04:00.309 --> 04:04:00.319 align:start position:0%
now to form a study committee to look
 
04:04:01.870 --> 04:04:01.880 align:start position:0%
into the problems with hiring law
 
04:04:03.750 --> 04:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement The Selective Service
 
04:04:06.110 --> 04:04:06.120 align:start position:0%
compliance Act is a hindrance to this
 
04:04:09.149 --> 04:04:09.159 align:start position:0%
process we limit the talent talent pool
 
04:04:11.229 --> 04:04:11.239 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily by putting hurdles in our
 
04:04:13.429 --> 04:04:13.439 align:start position:0%
own way the federal government already
 
04:04:15.870 --> 04:04:15.880 align:start position:0%
has steep penalties should someone fail
 
04:04:17.750 --> 04:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
to comply with the draft should it be
 
04:04:19.830 --> 04:04:19.840 align:start position:0%
started up again it doesn't make sense
 
04:04:22.630 --> 04:04:22.640 align:start position:0%
to me that we as a state put ourselves
 
04:04:25.070 --> 04:04:25.080 align:start position:0%
and our citizens at a disadvantage when
 
04:04:27.189 --> 04:04:27.199 align:start position:0%
the draft has not been active for 50
 
04:04:31.309 --> 04:04:31.319 align:start position:0%
years I ask that you vote OTP on hp55
 
04:04:35.870 --> 04:04:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:38.269 --> 04:04:38.279 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
04:04:41.229 --> 04:04:41.239 align:start position:0%
Foss yes so I did a lot of reading on
 
04:04:43.710 --> 04:04:43.720 align:start position:0%
this one and on the uh Selective Service
 
04:04:46.990 --> 04:04:47.000 align:start position:0%
act in general I know that Most states
 
04:04:51.030 --> 04:04:51.040 align:start position:0%
have a similar law which is um a
 
04:04:53.389 --> 04:04:53.399 align:start position:0%
variation of amendments in the actual
 
04:04:55.990 --> 04:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
law and that some don't do you know of
 
04:04:58.590 --> 04:04:58.600 align:start position:0%
any instances where as would be the case
 
04:05:00.910 --> 04:05:00.920 align:start position:0%
here a state had a law like this in
 
04:05:02.710 --> 04:05:02.720 align:start position:0%
place and then repealed it I don't know
 
04:05:04.030 --> 04:05:04.040 align:start position:0%
if any that have repealed it but I think
 
04:05:05.670 --> 04:05:05.680 align:start position:0%
it's like 30s something states have this
 
04:05:07.670 --> 04:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
on the books right now and like it it's
 
04:05:09.030 --> 04:05:09.040 align:start position:0%
probably one of those things that was F
 
04:05:10.149 --> 04:05:10.159 align:start position:0%
I know in New Hampshire was filed in
 
04:05:11.830 --> 04:05:11.840 align:start position:0%
like the late '90s and it's one of those
 
04:05:12.990 --> 04:05:13.000 align:start position:0%
things where I'm sure as guys from the
 
04:05:15.910 --> 04:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
Vietnam era that felt like you know uh
 
04:05:17.510 --> 04:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
people were draft dodging and they you
 
04:05:19.950 --> 04:05:19.960 align:start position:0%
know probably had some remorse or or not
 
04:05:21.670 --> 04:05:21.680 align:start position:0%
remorse but you know they they wish that
 
04:05:23.110 --> 04:05:23.120 align:start position:0%
more people would have stepped up and
 
04:05:24.950 --> 04:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
would been filed so they added extra
 
04:05:26.389 --> 04:05:26.399 align:start position:0%
penalties on top of the already like
 
04:05:27.790 --> 04:05:27.800 align:start position:0%
draft Dodger penalties that may come
 
04:05:30.309 --> 04:05:30.319 align:start position:0%
down from the federal government so I I
 
04:05:33.189 --> 04:05:33.199 align:start position:0%
I think like in in in light of the 21st
 
04:05:35.229 --> 04:05:35.239 align:start position:0%
century conflicts that have occurred I I
 
04:05:36.790 --> 04:05:36.800 align:start position:0%
think we should be a lot more skeptical
 
04:05:38.550 --> 04:05:38.560 align:start position:0%
about just like blind adherence to
 
04:05:39.750 --> 04:05:39.760 align:start position:0%
allowing the federal government to just
 
04:05:41.030 --> 04:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
snatch people off to send them off to
 
04:05:43.750 --> 04:05:43.760 align:start position:0%
war zones that may not have uh the the
 
04:05:45.510 --> 04:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
greatest outcomes for the United States
 
04:05:48.030 --> 04:05:48.040 align:start position:0%
including a you know future blowback
 
04:05:49.070 --> 04:05:49.080 align:start position:0%
that could occur down the line
 
04:05:51.429 --> 04:05:51.439 align:start position:0%
especially a decade from now um so
 
04:05:54.790 --> 04:05:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:57.349 --> 04:05:57.359 align:start position:0%
answer other
 
04:06:00.149 --> 04:06:00.159 align:start position:0%
questions representative Lloyd um in
 
04:06:02.550 --> 04:06:02.560 align:start position:0%
your testimony you stated that uh s
 
04:06:04.510 --> 04:06:04.520 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman by the way um in your
 
04:06:07.349 --> 04:06:07.359 align:start position:0%
testimony you stated that uh this is a
 
04:06:10.750 --> 04:06:10.760 align:start position:0%
hindrance to law enforcement um and and
 
04:06:12.189 --> 04:06:12.199 align:start position:0%
they're getting their numbers up for
 
04:06:14.229 --> 04:06:14.239 align:start position:0%
candidates and everything do are we
 
04:06:16.790 --> 04:06:16.800 align:start position:0%
hearing any testimony later today from
 
04:06:19.670 --> 04:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
law enforcement agencies to I was just
 
04:06:21.870 --> 04:06:21.880 align:start position:0%
so just to clarify we I I know that
 
04:06:24.510 --> 04:06:24.520 align:start position:0%
there I just bruising through the lsrs I
 
04:06:25.670 --> 04:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
know we have at least one study
 
04:06:27.110 --> 04:06:27.120 align:start position:0%
commission to study why we're having
 
04:06:29.070 --> 04:06:29.080 align:start position:0%
trouble recruiting law enforcement and
 
04:06:31.870 --> 04:06:31.880 align:start position:0%
like while this may not be a a even on
 
04:06:33.910 --> 04:06:33.920 align:start position:0%
the radar of what their problems are
 
04:06:35.429 --> 04:06:35.439 align:start position:0%
it's one more thing that it's like okay
 
04:06:36.950 --> 04:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
well we have this perfect candidate like
 
04:06:38.870 --> 04:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
he's a like you know whatever and then
 
04:06:40.910 --> 04:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
oh wait he's a conscientious objector he
 
04:06:42.110 --> 04:06:42.120 align:start position:0%
has no he doesn't want to register for
 
04:06:44.030 --> 04:06:44.040 align:start position:0%
the draft well can't hire him
 
04:06:46.149 --> 04:06:46.159 align:start position:0%
like we're not allowed to hire them
 
04:06:48.309 --> 04:06:48.319 align:start position:0%
that's what the the RSA currently says
 
04:06:50.110 --> 04:06:50.120 align:start position:0%
we we're not allowed to each department
 
04:06:54.510 --> 04:06:54.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:57.429 --> 04:06:57.439 align:start position:0%
this representative F kind of asked a
 
04:07:00.870 --> 04:07:00.880 align:start position:0%
question I made a note about so just to
 
04:07:02.950 --> 04:07:02.960 align:start position:0%
uh follow up on what she said to be
 
04:07:05.710 --> 04:07:05.720 align:start position:0%
clear uh is there a single other state
 
04:07:08.149 --> 04:07:08.159 align:start position:0%
that has repealed not that I'm aware of
 
04:07:09.630 --> 04:07:09.640 align:start position:0%
I haven't looked into seeing who has
 
04:07:13.229 --> 04:07:13.239 align:start position:0%
repealed it okay so to your knowledge
 
04:07:14.790 --> 04:07:14.800 align:start position:0%
there not a single other state that has
 
04:07:18.309 --> 04:07:18.319 align:start position:0%
done this not it's my knowledge no okay
 
04:07:21.189 --> 04:07:21.199 align:start position:0%
qu other questions for the prime sponsor
 
04:07:24.309 --> 04:07:24.319 align:start position:0%
I do represent of cyber yeah I just had
 
04:07:30.790 --> 04:07:30.800 align:start position:0%
a question in regards to um hold on one
 
04:07:33.189 --> 04:07:33.199 align:start position:0%
second no I think you cleared it up
 
04:07:38.870 --> 04:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:41.510 --> 04:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
sorry okay before we lose the prime
 
04:07:43.510 --> 04:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
sponsor I I do have some pink cards and
 
04:07:46.750 --> 04:07:46.760 align:start position:0%
some uh people who uh want to testify
 
04:07:49.229 --> 04:07:49.239 align:start position:0%
that the as a history guy the purpose of
 
04:07:51.229 --> 04:07:51.239 align:start position:0%
the draft you know it came about Civil
 
04:07:53.309 --> 04:07:53.319 align:start position:0%
War and then was gone came back World
 
04:07:57.070 --> 04:07:57.080 align:start position:0%
War I S uh The Selective s the draft was
 
04:07:59.469 --> 04:07:59.479 align:start position:0%
brought back like in 1940 and then it
 
04:08:03.550 --> 04:08:03.560 align:start position:0%
was by one vote in 1941 the year we went
 
04:08:05.590 --> 04:08:05.600 align:start position:0%
to war they almost did away with the
 
04:08:08.109 --> 04:08:08.119 align:start position:0%
draft and by one vote in Congress they
 
04:08:11.269 --> 04:08:11.279 align:start position:0%
kept it uh and then it's been back and
 
04:08:14.349 --> 04:08:14.359 align:start position:0%
forth up and down uh it went away in
 
04:08:16.990 --> 04:08:17.000 align:start position:0%
1973 I know that because I turned 18
 
04:08:19.990 --> 04:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
just at that time purpose of the draft
 
04:08:22.750 --> 04:08:22.760 align:start position:0%
is to come up with people um Manpower
 
04:08:27.790 --> 04:08:27.800 align:start position:0%
person power in a time of uh War uh in
 
04:08:31.590 --> 04:08:31.600 align:start position:0%
time of uh need I think we needed the
 
04:08:33.630 --> 04:08:33.640 align:start position:0%
draft certainly after Pearl Harbor as it
 
04:08:35.830 --> 04:08:35.840 align:start position:0%
turned out or else we would not have had
 
04:08:39.670 --> 04:08:39.680 align:start position:0%
the Personnel we needed to win the war
 
04:08:43.990 --> 04:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
in my view so given that that purpose of
 
04:08:45.790 --> 04:08:45.800 align:start position:0%
the draft and the reason they kept
 
04:08:47.790 --> 04:08:47.800 align:start position:0%
selective service was to have a
 
04:08:49.550 --> 04:08:49.560 align:start position:0%
mechanism or structure in place if we
 
04:08:53.469 --> 04:08:53.479 align:start position:0%
had to go back to it uh what if we did
 
04:08:59.030 --> 04:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
have a another massive uh War start
 
04:09:02.590 --> 04:09:02.600 align:start position:0%
where we needed people uh without the
 
04:09:05.189 --> 04:09:05.199 align:start position:0%
Selective Service would we be up the
 
04:09:08.070 --> 04:09:08.080 align:start position:0%
creek without a paddle or so how would
 
04:09:09.750 --> 04:09:09.760 align:start position:0%
you what do you say to that you mean in
 
04:09:12.030 --> 04:09:12.040 align:start position:0%
general or in part in regards my
 
04:09:14.710 --> 04:09:14.720 align:start position:0%
question is what if there was a big war
 
04:09:16.109 --> 04:09:16.119 align:start position:0%
and we don't have selective we don't
 
04:09:18.990 --> 04:09:19.000 align:start position:0%
have a draft oh okay so uh my bill
 
04:09:20.149 --> 04:09:20.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't touch that for the record it
 
04:09:21.870 --> 04:09:21.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't stop the draft it just stops
 
04:09:23.750 --> 04:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
like us penalizing ourselves for people
 
04:09:26.070 --> 04:09:26.080 align:start position:0%
not registering for the draft so to to
 
04:09:27.710 --> 04:09:27.720 align:start position:0%
go follow on from that I believe that in
 
04:09:29.349 --> 04:09:29.359 align:start position:0%
the times of need people will step up
 
04:09:31.910 --> 04:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
when it's required and what what that
 
04:09:34.269 --> 04:09:34.279 align:start position:0%
definition of is required it depends on
 
04:09:36.630 --> 04:09:36.640 align:start position:0%
the context of the conflict if we are in
 
04:09:38.630 --> 04:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
being invaded I believe that many people
 
04:09:40.309 --> 04:09:40.319 align:start position:0%
will step up
 
04:09:42.550 --> 04:09:42.560 align:start position:0%
like there's that famous quote I think
 
04:09:44.790 --> 04:09:44.800 align:start position:0%
it was like uh from World War II from
 
04:09:47.429 --> 04:09:47.439 align:start position:0%
Japan this say a gun behind every blade
 
04:09:49.269 --> 04:09:49.279 align:start position:0%
of grass I believe that type of thing
 
04:09:51.550 --> 04:09:51.560 align:start position:0%
would be unnecessary to start a giraff
 
04:09:52.590 --> 04:09:52.600 align:start position:0%
because people would just step up and
 
04:09:54.510 --> 04:09:54.520 align:start position:0%
defend their neighborhoods uh then we
 
04:09:56.269 --> 04:09:56.279 align:start position:0%
move into the great the greater scheme
 
04:09:58.469 --> 04:09:58.479 align:start position:0%
of invading foreign countries and my
 
04:10:00.189 --> 04:10:00.199 align:start position:0%
question would end up being currently
 
04:10:01.429 --> 04:10:01.439 align:start position:0%
like looking at the conflicts of the
 
04:10:05.070 --> 04:10:05.080 align:start position:0%
21st century for what purpose uh are we
 
04:10:08.550 --> 04:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
invading Iraq again are we invading
 
04:10:11.349 --> 04:10:11.359 align:start position:0%
Northern Africa or you know Russia
 
04:10:14.189 --> 04:10:14.199 align:start position:0%
because of Ukraine uh China because of
 
04:10:16.870 --> 04:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
Taiwan like I'm I I I struggle to find a
 
04:10:18.229 --> 04:10:18.239 align:start position:0%
situation where a draft would be
 
04:10:22.309 --> 04:10:22.319 align:start position:0%
necessary in the current uh geopolitical
 
04:10:25.309 --> 04:10:25.319 align:start position:0%
climate Okay represent
 
04:10:27.750 --> 04:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
Foss actually just occurred to me while
 
04:10:31.429 --> 04:10:31.439 align:start position:0%
you were speaking so uh there's no uh
 
04:10:34.229 --> 04:10:34.239 align:start position:0%
like exception for somebody who is a
 
04:10:37.910 --> 04:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
conscientious objector no currently the
 
04:10:39.910 --> 04:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
only exceptions to the rule are people
 
04:10:41.309 --> 04:10:41.319 align:start position:0%
who are previously enlisted and
 
04:10:43.750 --> 04:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
physically aren't in unable to register
 
04:10:45.229 --> 04:10:45.239 align:start position:0%
for the draft because of mental
 
04:10:46.670 --> 04:10:46.680 align:start position:0%
disability physical disability
 
04:10:48.269 --> 04:10:48.279 align:start position:0%
conscientious objector status does not
 
04:10:52.030 --> 04:10:52.040 align:start position:0%
apply okay thank you yeah actually okay
 
04:10:54.109 --> 04:10:54.119 align:start position:0%
so I was going to ask another question
 
04:10:56.149 --> 04:10:56.159 align:start position:0%
about the states in
 
04:10:59.870 --> 04:10:59.880 align:start position:0%
particular um is that okay oh I'm
 
04:11:02.950 --> 04:11:02.960 align:start position:0%
sorry uh representative cyber yeah sorry
 
04:11:04.109 --> 04:11:04.119 align:start position:0%
I should have asked
 
04:11:08.269 --> 04:11:08.279 align:start position:0%
you um so um when it comes to you had
 
04:11:10.349 --> 04:11:10.359 align:start position:0%
mentioned about other states receiving
 
04:11:13.950 --> 04:11:13.960 align:start position:0%
compensation for enforcing
 
04:11:15.910 --> 04:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
the sign up for the draft is that what
 
04:11:17.389 --> 04:11:17.399 align:start position:0%
you were talking about or I was I was
 
04:11:18.750 --> 04:11:18.760 align:start position:0%
talking about other programs whether it
 
04:11:21.030 --> 04:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
be like drug enforcement agency or ATF
 
04:11:23.189 --> 04:11:23.199 align:start position:0%
cooperation or border patrol like things
 
04:11:24.590 --> 04:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
like that we get compensation for
 
04:11:25.750 --> 04:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
helping the federal government with
 
04:11:27.189 --> 04:11:27.199 align:start position:0%
their Federal programs oh I see what
 
04:11:28.590 --> 04:11:28.600 align:start position:0%
you're saying there's no compensation
 
04:11:30.030 --> 04:11:30.040 align:start position:0%
for us enforcing The Selective Service
 
04:11:31.630 --> 04:11:31.640 align:start position:0%
and we're not even like in an active
 
04:11:33.349 --> 04:11:33.359 align:start position:0%
draft right now so we're getting nothing
 
04:11:34.990 --> 04:11:35.000 align:start position:0%
out of this and just hindering
 
04:11:37.790 --> 04:11:37.800 align:start position:0%
ourselves are there any may I ask
 
04:11:41.429 --> 04:11:41.439 align:start position:0%
another question sorry follow up um with
 
04:11:42.790 --> 04:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
saying that you know we don't receive
 
04:11:45.469 --> 04:11:45.479 align:start position:0%
any comp compensation are there
 
04:11:48.389 --> 04:11:48.399 align:start position:0%
penalties that are possible for that
 
04:11:49.990 --> 04:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
yeah I I don't know off the top of my
 
04:11:51.269 --> 04:11:51.279 align:start position:0%
head but there are very steep penalties
 
04:11:52.750 --> 04:11:52.760 align:start position:0%
for not complying with the draft they
 
04:11:54.670 --> 04:11:54.680 align:start position:0%
include the prison time and and several
 
04:11:57.389 --> 04:11:57.399 align:start position:0%
thousand fines if the draft were
 
04:12:00.269 --> 04:12:00.279 align:start position:0%
activated yes and you didn't muster all
 
04:12:02.790 --> 04:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
right thank you other questions for the
 
04:12:02.800 --> 04:12:04.750 align:start position:0%
right thank you other questions for the
prime

04:12:04.750 --> 04:12:04.760 align:start position:0%
prime
 
04:12:08.109 --> 04:12:08.119 align:start position:0%
sponsor saying none uh
 
04:12:11.309 --> 04:12:11.319 align:start position:0%
uh representative Hemingway
 
04:12:13.950 --> 04:12:13.960 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman
 
04:12:17.309 --> 04:12:17.319 align:start position:0%
so representative um you said that the
 
04:12:18.750 --> 04:12:18.760 align:start position:0%
law enforcement were having problems
 
04:12:21.269 --> 04:12:21.279 align:start position:0%
getting uh recruits because of the
 
04:12:23.710 --> 04:12:23.720 align:start position:0%
conscientious Observer I'm sorry to
 
04:12:25.269 --> 04:12:25.279 align:start position:0%
clarify the only reason I mentioned that
 
04:12:26.750 --> 04:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
is because it's a current study
 
04:12:28.750 --> 04:12:28.760 align:start position:0%
committee that is in an there's an LSR
 
04:12:31.469 --> 04:12:31.479 align:start position:0%
that was filed uh on to study a
 
04:12:33.030 --> 04:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
recruitment hurdle that they're running
 
04:12:35.950 --> 04:12:35.960 align:start position:0%
into they don't know why I just say well
 
04:12:37.070 --> 04:12:37.080 align:start position:0%
if we're going to be studying why we
 
04:12:38.510 --> 04:12:38.520 align:start position:0%
can't hire people why are we have all
 
04:12:40.030 --> 04:12:40.040 align:start position:0%
these laws on the books that already say
 
04:12:42.429 --> 04:12:42.439 align:start position:0%
we can't we literally are not allowed to
 
04:12:45.030 --> 04:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
hire a certain subset of people based on
 
04:12:48.030 --> 04:12:48.040 align:start position:0%
this flag for flag you didn't sign up
 
04:12:49.830 --> 04:12:49.840 align:start position:0%
for the draft and we can't hire you
 
04:12:51.229 --> 04:12:51.239 align:start position:0%
because of that even though you're like
 
04:12:53.510 --> 04:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
potentially the best candidate for this
 
04:12:54.950 --> 04:12:54.960 align:start position:0%
like that seems like we're putting
 
04:12:56.389 --> 04:12:56.399 align:start position:0%
roadblocks in the way that shouldn't
 
04:12:59.189 --> 04:12:59.199 align:start position:0%
exist as a state follow up
 
04:13:01.990 --> 04:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
followup so if they object to do their
 
04:13:04.429 --> 04:13:04.439 align:start position:0%
job and carry weapons in a
 
04:13:06.590 --> 04:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
combat how are they going to carry guns
 
04:13:09.269 --> 04:13:09.279 align:start position:0%
in a law enforcement environment they
 
04:13:12.109 --> 04:13:12.119 align:start position:0%
they may be perfectly fine uh helping
 
04:13:13.389 --> 04:13:13.399 align:start position:0%
their neighborhoods they may may be
 
04:13:15.469 --> 04:13:15.479 align:start position:0%
perfectly fine carrying a firearm to
 
04:13:16.750 --> 04:13:16.760 align:start position:0%
defend the lives of the people around
 
04:13:18.269 --> 04:13:18.279 align:start position:0%
them but they may not be okay with going
 
04:13:20.189 --> 04:13:20.199 align:start position:0%
to foreign conflicts to take the lives
 
04:13:23.149 --> 04:13:23.159 align:start position:0%
of people that did nothing wrong to
 
04:13:25.309 --> 04:13:25.319 align:start position:0%
them other
 
04:13:29.389 --> 04:13:29.399 align:start position:0%
questions uh who was first uh
 
04:13:32.870 --> 04:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
repres representative Lloyd thank you Mr
 
04:13:37.229 --> 04:13:37.239 align:start position:0%
chairman um so a question for you
 
04:13:39.950 --> 04:13:39.960 align:start position:0%
basically this would this would not
 
04:13:43.229 --> 04:13:43.239 align:start position:0%
cancel the national draft for purposes
 
04:13:45.630 --> 04:13:45.640 align:start position:0%
of the the federal government however
 
04:13:48.429 --> 04:13:48.439 align:start position:0%
for uh the repercussions here in New
 
04:13:51.429 --> 04:13:51.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would no longer be on file
 
04:13:52.830 --> 04:13:52.840 align:start position:0%
with this legislation that's correct as
 
04:13:54.510 --> 04:13:54.520 align:start position:0%
I said I'll clarify again this does not
 
04:13:56.389 --> 04:13:56.399 align:start position:0%
stop the draft this doesn't even get in
 
04:13:58.070 --> 04:13:58.080 align:start position:0%
the way of the draft this just removes
 
04:14:00.109 --> 04:14:00.119 align:start position:0%
hurdles that we've decided as for
 
04:14:02.910 --> 04:14:02.920 align:start position:0%
whatever reason 25 years ago put this in
 
04:14:06.030 --> 04:14:06.040 align:start position:0%
R RSA to make it so we can't hire people
 
04:14:07.790 --> 04:14:07.800 align:start position:0%
and children can't go to higher
 
04:14:10.070 --> 04:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
education unless they say I'm okay with
 
04:14:14.349 --> 04:14:14.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:15.910 --> 04:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for that clarification that
 
04:14:18.950 --> 04:14:18.960 align:start position:0%
that helps reps and fos uh yes I just
 
04:14:22.750 --> 04:14:22.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that uh we're clear
 
04:14:24.510 --> 04:14:24.520 align:start position:0%
um so when you we're talking about the
 
04:14:26.870 --> 04:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
penalties earlier in including the
 
04:14:29.189 --> 04:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
that's penalties for the individual and
 
04:14:32.229 --> 04:14:32.239 align:start position:0%
from the federal government yes um are
 
04:14:34.510 --> 04:14:34.520 align:start position:0%
but are there are no penalties to the
 
04:14:37.469 --> 04:14:37.479 align:start position:0%
states right no no we're the state
 
04:14:39.189 --> 04:14:39.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't penalize people for not this is
 
04:14:41.109 --> 04:14:41.119 align:start position:0%
our only penalty that exists for failure
 
04:14:43.030 --> 04:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
to comply no I mean there would be no
 
04:14:45.229 --> 04:14:45.239 align:start position:0%
penties from the government to a state
 
04:14:48.070 --> 04:14:48.080 align:start position:0%
for not having no as far as I have seen
 
04:14:49.710 --> 04:14:49.720 align:start position:0%
no there's like the fiscal note says
 
04:14:51.790 --> 04:14:51.800 align:start position:0%
nothing like if we fail to uh enforce
 
04:14:52.950 --> 04:14:52.960 align:start position:0%
this law we just took this upon
 
04:14:56.510 --> 04:14:56.520 align:start position:0%
ourselves to enforce the draft thank you
 
04:14:59.229 --> 04:14:59.239 align:start position:0%
representative mandal bomb thank you Mr
 
04:15:01.030 --> 04:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
chair um could you please repeat what
 
04:15:04.550 --> 04:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
you said about the FAFSA so FAFSA is uh
 
04:15:06.269 --> 04:15:06.279 align:start position:0%
you you used to when you applied for
 
04:15:07.990 --> 04:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
federal student aid you'd go through the
 
04:15:09.990 --> 04:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
fasta form and there used to be a
 
04:15:11.349 --> 04:15:11.359 align:start position:0%
component on there that required that
 
04:15:12.670 --> 04:15:12.680 align:start position:0%
you would registered for the draft very
 
04:15:14.910 --> 04:15:14.920 align:start position:0%
similar to the New Hampshire law that is
 
04:15:16.870 --> 04:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
phasing out this year I'm not sure when
 
04:15:19.109 --> 04:15:19.119 align:start position:0%
that started but that it officially ends
 
04:15:21.189 --> 04:15:21.199 align:start position:0%
this year when you file for federal
 
04:15:23.269 --> 04:15:23.279 align:start position:0%
student aid you no longer have to comply
 
04:15:26.510 --> 04:15:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:31.710 --> 04:15:31.720 align:start position:0%
draft followup so to clarify so what
 
04:15:35.510 --> 04:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
FAFSA is doing doesn't have any is not
 
04:15:37.710 --> 04:15:37.720 align:start position:0%
related to this bill it's just saying
 
04:15:39.510 --> 04:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
that it this bill wouldn't interfere
 
04:15:41.429 --> 04:15:41.439 align:start position:0%
with faf's process that's correct the
 
04:15:42.550 --> 04:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
reason I brought it up is because it's
 
04:15:44.149 --> 04:15:44.159 align:start position:0%
pretty fun that the federal government
 
04:15:45.630 --> 04:15:45.640 align:start position:0%
is saying we're not going to enforce our
 
04:15:47.389 --> 04:15:47.399 align:start position:0%
own law and then the New Hampshire is
 
04:15:49.189 --> 04:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
still going to enforce their law on
 
04:15:52.710 --> 04:15:52.720 align:start position:0%
their behalf for no
 
04:15:55.229 --> 04:15:55.239 align:start position:0%
upside other
 
04:15:58.070 --> 04:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none uh thank you Mr

04:16:32.189 --> 04:16:32.199 align:start position:0%

04:17:10.910 --> 04:17:10.920 align:start position:0%
moment okay welcome back General thanks
 
04:17:13.349 --> 04:17:13.359 align:start position:0%
sir Mr chair committee members for the a
 
04:17:15.830 --> 04:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
Major General David mtis the agent
 
04:17:17.309 --> 04:17:17.319 align:start position:0%
General FL New Hampshire National Guard
 
04:17:18.429 --> 04:17:18.439 align:start position:0%
and the commissioner Department of
 
04:17:20.429 --> 04:17:20.439 align:start position:0%
military Affairs and veteran
 
04:17:23.229 --> 04:17:23.239 align:start position:0%
services uh on the the the bottom line
 
04:17:24.750 --> 04:17:24.760 align:start position:0%
on the front as we are opposed to this
 
04:17:28.269 --> 04:17:28.279 align:start position:0%
bill I wear two hats as the ad general f
 
04:17:30.910 --> 04:17:30.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire National Guard I don't see
 
04:17:34.229 --> 04:17:34.239 align:start position:0%
a sort of in a direct impact that repeal
 
04:17:37.189 --> 04:17:37.199 align:start position:0%
of this legislation would affect their
 
04:17:38.429 --> 04:17:38.439 align:start position:0%
recruiting and retention of men and
 
04:17:39.590 --> 04:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
women at the New Hampshire National
 
04:17:42.429 --> 04:17:42.439 align:start position:0%
Guard so on the on the Ed General side
 
04:17:44.790 --> 04:17:44.800 align:start position:0%
of it I don't don't see a direct impact
 
04:17:46.309 --> 04:17:46.319 align:start position:0%
other than the fact that one of the
 
04:17:49.469 --> 04:17:49.479 align:start position:0%
punishments in state law is um your in
 
04:17:51.750 --> 04:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
ineligibility if you do not apply if you
 
04:17:53.229 --> 04:17:53.239 align:start position:0%
don't fill out the selective compliance
 
04:17:55.590 --> 04:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
Act is you're in ineligible for you know
 
04:17:57.870 --> 04:17:57.880 align:start position:0%
State financial uh Awards or incentives
 
04:18:00.469 --> 04:18:00.479 align:start position:0%
for a second postsecondary education
 
04:18:02.309 --> 04:18:02.319 align:start position:0%
that would sort of uh give us a Level
 
04:18:03.870 --> 04:18:03.880 align:start position:0%
Playing Field unfortunately for service
 
04:18:05.750 --> 04:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
members who don't want to serve versus
 
04:18:07.109 --> 04:18:07.119 align:start position:0%
our biggest thing is tuition waiver at
 
04:18:09.309 --> 04:18:09.319 align:start position:0%
the University system of New Hampshire
 
04:18:12.189 --> 04:18:12.199 align:start position:0%
so but generally speaking um as an AG in
 
04:18:14.269 --> 04:18:14.279 align:start position:0%
general we're sort of neutral in this
 
04:18:16.510 --> 04:18:16.520 align:start position:0%
bill why I'm adamantly opposed to it is
 
04:18:17.590 --> 04:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
is because I'm the commissioner of the
 
04:18:18.750 --> 04:18:18.760 align:start position:0%
Department of military Affairs and
 
04:18:21.950 --> 04:18:21.960 align:start position:0%
veteran services so let's establish some
 
04:18:24.790 --> 04:18:24.800 align:start position:0%
facts as uh the chair gave you a little
 
04:18:26.469 --> 04:18:26.479 align:start position:0%
bit of history of The Selective Service
 
04:18:29.189 --> 04:18:29.199 align:start position:0%
Act the B biggest thing I would give um
 
04:18:32.189 --> 04:18:32.199 align:start position:0%
um offer to you is there's a
 
04:18:35.710 --> 04:18:35.720 align:start position:0%
84% National compliance rate from
 
04:18:37.670 --> 04:18:37.680 align:start position:0%
calendar the last statistic was uh
 
04:18:40.429 --> 04:18:40.439 align:start position:0%
calendar year 2023 with the Selective
 
04:18:43.070 --> 04:18:43.080 align:start position:0%
Service Act
 
04:18:44.750 --> 04:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
in The Selective Service Act if you
 
04:18:48.630 --> 04:18:48.640 align:start position:0%
don't um um apply or enroll in it you're
 
04:18:50.630 --> 04:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
eligible up to a fiveyear a felony
 
04:18:52.790 --> 04:18:52.800 align:start position:0%
conviction up to 5 years incarceration
 
04:18:56.790 --> 04:18:56.800 align:start position:0%
and a $250,000 fine and in addition to C
 
04:18:59.189 --> 04:18:59.199 align:start position:0%
certain uh Federal incentiv um you know
 
04:19:02.670 --> 04:19:02.680 align:start position:0%
financial assistance that's Federal as a
 
04:19:05.590 --> 04:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
representative alluded to 31 States out
 
04:19:08.790 --> 04:19:08.800 align:start position:0%
of the 54 states in territories have
 
04:19:11.070 --> 04:19:11.080 align:start position:0%
additional constraints or restrictions
 
04:19:14.349 --> 04:19:14.359 align:start position:0%
or punishment at the state level if you
 
04:19:16.510 --> 04:19:16.520 align:start position:0%
do not adhere to the federal selective
 
04:19:18.870 --> 04:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
service act so when you look at the
 
04:19:21.750 --> 04:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
three items at New Hampshire um has put
 
04:19:24.269 --> 04:19:24.279 align:start position:0%
in statute two of them maintain the
 
04:19:26.469 --> 04:19:26.479 align:start position:0%
education and one of them also maintains
 
04:19:28.550 --> 04:19:28.560 align:start position:0%
to an employer in state
 
04:19:30.670 --> 04:19:30.680 align:start position:0%
government at the state level in New
 
04:19:32.990 --> 04:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire there's about a 75% compliance
 
04:19:36.070 --> 04:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
rate with the Selective Service Act we
 
04:19:37.469 --> 04:19:37.479 align:start position:0%
or I am opposed to it as the
 
04:19:38.710 --> 04:19:38.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner of Department of military
 
04:19:41.149 --> 04:19:41.159 align:start position:0%
Affairs because of our dual mission of
 
04:19:43.510 --> 04:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
supporting the men and women in uni form
 
04:19:45.550 --> 04:19:45.560 align:start position:0%
and the 990,000 veterans in the state of
 
04:19:47.830 --> 04:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and as the bill sponsor
 
04:19:50.030 --> 04:19:50.040 align:start position:0%
alluded to I do not want a conscientious
 
04:19:52.990 --> 04:19:53.000 align:start position:0%
objector as a state employee who's
 
04:19:55.070 --> 04:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
working as a veteran service officer to
 
04:19:57.710 --> 04:19:57.720 align:start position:0%
give them the care and uh necessary sort
 
04:19:59.550 --> 04:19:59.560 align:start position:0%
of services that a veteran deserves in
 
04:19:59.560 --> 04:20:00.870 align:start position:0%
of services that a veteran deserves in
this

04:20:00.870 --> 04:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:20:03.389 --> 04:20:03.399 align:start position:0%
state so as a minimum I adamantly
 
04:20:05.349 --> 04:20:05.359 align:start position:0%
opposed to this restriction being
 
04:20:07.590 --> 04:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
repealed from state government as an
 
04:20:10.189 --> 04:20:10.199 align:start position:0%
employer of and care of the 90,000
 
04:20:12.030 --> 04:20:12.040 align:start position:0%
veterans in the state of New Hampshire
 
04:20:14.309 --> 04:20:14.319 align:start position:0%
subject to the question that's all I
 
04:20:16.630 --> 04:20:16.640 align:start position:0%
have so you will take are there any
 
04:20:18.109 --> 04:20:18.119 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
04:20:20.469 --> 04:20:20.479 align:start position:0%
F uh so regarding what you just said
 
04:20:22.830 --> 04:20:22.840 align:start position:0%
about conscientious objectors uh so
 
04:20:24.830 --> 04:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
you're saying somebody who was a Quaker
 
04:20:26.990 --> 04:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be as good at providing care or
 
04:20:28.870 --> 04:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
me for example because I'm a woman and I
 
04:20:29.910 --> 04:20:29.920 align:start position:0%
didn't have to register for the
 
04:20:29.920 --> 04:20:31.149 align:start position:0%
didn't have to register for the
Selective

04:20:31.149 --> 04:20:31.159 align:start position:0%
Selective
 
04:20:36.750 --> 04:20:36.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:36.760 --> 04:20:39.070 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:20:39.070 --> 04:20:39.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:41.670 --> 04:20:41.680 align:start position:0%
if according to federal law 18 to 26
 
04:20:44.670 --> 04:20:44.680 align:start position:0%
year old males must register so if an 18
 
04:20:46.389 --> 04:20:46.399 align:start position:0%
and 26-year-old male to make the
 
04:20:48.670 --> 04:20:48.680 align:start position:0%
decision to not want to enroll in The
 
04:20:50.990 --> 04:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
Selective Service Act why would I want
 
04:20:52.469 --> 04:20:52.479 align:start position:0%
them an employee to be taking care of
 
04:20:54.630 --> 04:20:54.640 align:start position:0%
our veterans the requirement doesn't
 
04:20:57.389 --> 04:20:57.399 align:start position:0%
apply to you or a Quaker or that's not
 
04:20:58.790 --> 04:20:58.800 align:start position:0%
what the federal law is about doesn't
 
04:21:01.030 --> 04:21:01.040 align:start position:0%
give you it doesn't matter to religion
 
04:21:03.710 --> 04:21:03.720 align:start position:0%
and um gender I
 
04:21:09.109 --> 04:21:09.119 align:start position:0%
would follow up yes but qu many Quakers
 
04:21:12.950 --> 04:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
are conscientious objectors so that
 
04:21:15.309 --> 04:21:15.319 align:start position:0%
would apply if you're saying you don't
 
04:21:18.550 --> 04:21:18.560 align:start position:0%
want any conscientious objectors and
 
04:21:20.349 --> 04:21:20.359 align:start position:0%
representative Manion said that there's
 
04:21:22.389 --> 04:21:22.399 align:start position:0%
no conscientious
 
04:21:25.670 --> 04:21:25.680 align:start position:0%
objector uh exception so that would rule
 
04:21:29.469 --> 04:21:29.479 align:start position:0%
out a lot of people based on religion uh
 
04:21:30.590 --> 04:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
all right let me I'll rephrase my
 
04:21:32.469 --> 04:21:32.479 align:start position:0%
response to saying any male between the
 
04:21:35.510 --> 04:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
ages of 18 and 26 who refuses apply or
 
04:21:37.550 --> 04:21:37.560 align:start position:0%
sign up for the effective Service Act in
 
04:21:39.630 --> 04:21:39.640 align:start position:0%
the future could be hired as an employer
 
04:21:41.590 --> 04:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
in the department of military Affairs I
 
04:21:43.670 --> 04:21:43.680 align:start position:0%
don't think if they if they can't do the
 
04:21:45.590 --> 04:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
basic civic duty like pledge of pledge
 
04:21:47.790 --> 04:21:47.800 align:start position:0%
of allegiance and it's a federal law
 
04:21:51.469 --> 04:21:51.479 align:start position:0%
then um I would be concerned um with
 
04:21:53.269 --> 04:21:53.279 align:start position:0%
their employment status how they want to
 
04:21:56.109 --> 04:21:56.119 align:start position:0%
take care of our veterans who have
 
04:21:59.229 --> 04:21:59.239 align:start position:0%
served other
 
04:22:03.950 --> 04:22:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:07.710 --> 04:22:07.720 align:start position:0%
General representative Heath
 
04:22:10.510 --> 04:22:10.520 align:start position:0%
Howard is in support of the bill he's
 
04:22:14.070 --> 04:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
asked for three minutes
 
04:22:15.950 --> 04:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
and we have no time restrictions if you
 
04:22:18.910 --> 04:22:18.920 align:start position:0%
go over that well thank you Mr chair or
 
04:22:21.309 --> 04:22:21.319 align:start position:0%
under it than thank you represent thank
 
04:22:22.670 --> 04:22:22.680 align:start position:0%
you honorable chair and members of the
 
04:22:24.750 --> 04:22:24.760 align:start position:0%
committee uh my name is representative
 
04:22:26.229 --> 04:22:26.239 align:start position:0%
Heath Howard I represent the towns of
 
04:22:27.870 --> 04:22:27.880 align:start position:0%
straford and barington in straford
 
04:22:30.910 --> 04:22:30.920 align:start position:0%
District 4 uh when I was 16 years old I
 
04:22:33.510 --> 04:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
broke my back I had a L4 burst fracture
 
04:22:36.070 --> 04:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
I had four rods and eight screws put in
 
04:22:38.510 --> 04:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
and because of that i' I've always been
 
04:22:40.269 --> 04:22:40.279 align:start position:0%
exempt for the draft I've never had to
 
04:22:41.790 --> 04:22:41.800 align:start position:0%
worry about having to fight in an
 
04:22:43.070 --> 04:22:43.080 align:start position:0%
overseas War
 
04:22:44.750 --> 04:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
and is never something that I would want
 
04:22:47.830 --> 04:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
to force upon others uh when I myself am
 
04:22:50.870 --> 04:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
not subject to that our veterans uh make
 
04:22:52.790 --> 04:22:52.800 align:start position:0%
such great sacrifices and I think that
 
04:22:55.189 --> 04:22:55.199 align:start position:0%
we're very lucky to have a very robust
 
04:22:57.830 --> 04:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
uh voluntary force and it is for those
 
04:22:59.710 --> 04:22:59.720 align:start position:0%
reasons that I'm in support of hp55
 
04:23:00.670 --> 04:23:00.680 align:start position:0%
because I don't think anybody should
 
04:23:02.710 --> 04:23:02.720 align:start position:0%
have to break their back uh in order to
 
04:23:05.070 --> 04:23:05.080 align:start position:0%
get out of military service or die in a
 
04:23:06.710 --> 04:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
war that they don't believe in and I
 
04:23:08.550 --> 04:23:08.560 align:start position:0%
don't think that they should be punished
 
04:23:11.070 --> 04:23:11.080 align:start position:0%
uh for not consenting to the draft uh
 
04:23:13.149 --> 04:23:13.159 align:start position:0%
like my good friend from pelum said you
 
04:23:14.950 --> 04:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
know there are a number of restrictions
 
04:23:17.670 --> 04:23:17.680 align:start position:0%
that are placed on people when they
 
04:23:20.229 --> 04:23:20.239 align:start position:0%
object to uh submitting their draft card
 
04:23:22.590 --> 04:23:22.600 align:start position:0%
it is something uh that I think is
 
04:23:25.429 --> 04:23:25.439 align:start position:0%
egregious and limits people's individual
 
04:23:28.630 --> 04:23:28.640 align:start position:0%
freedoms and Liberties uh I don't think
 
04:23:31.469 --> 04:23:31.479 align:start position:0%
that we really have a future need for
 
04:23:33.429 --> 04:23:33.439 align:start position:0%
the draft in our current geopolitical
 
04:23:35.630 --> 04:23:35.640 align:start position:0%
state as the the the representative
 
04:23:38.950 --> 04:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
palum had said and I truly believe that
 
04:23:41.630 --> 04:23:41.640 align:start position:0%
this is something that will uh allow
 
04:23:44.670 --> 04:23:44.680 align:start position:0%
people to exercise their rights fully
 
04:23:46.950 --> 04:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
thank you so much uh I'm open to any
 
04:23:50.870 --> 04:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:53.670 --> 04:23:53.680 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none uh thank you
 
04:23:55.910 --> 04:23:55.920 align:start position:0%

04:24:01.109 --> 04:24:01.119 align:start position:0%

04:24:12.830 --> 04:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
asked for 5 minutes uh welcome back Mr
 
04:24:14.950 --> 04:24:14.960 align:start position:0%

I am a 25- year Air Force veteran and I
 
04:24:23.830 --> 04:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
am a 27-year veteran of the town of
 
04:24:26.469 --> 04:24:26.479 align:start position:0%
hookit New Hampshire and today here I'm
 
04:24:28.189 --> 04:24:28.199 align:start position:0%
speaking on behalf of the state veterans
 
04:24:29.630 --> 04:24:29.640 align:start position:0%
advisory committee that we talk to you
 
04:24:32.189 --> 04:24:32.199 align:start position:0%
about this morning who we are and and
 
04:24:35.670 --> 04:24:35.680 align:start position:0%
what we do um during the last
 
04:24:38.950 --> 04:24:38.960 align:start position:0%
legislative session there were two bills
 
04:24:41.590 --> 04:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
that dealt with social with the
 
04:24:44.109 --> 04:24:44.119 align:start position:0%
Selective Service act the first would
 
04:24:47.710 --> 04:24:47.720 align:start position:0%
have required that we post uh some
 
04:24:50.910 --> 04:24:50.920 align:start position:0%
statistics and other was 1247 if you
 
04:24:52.990 --> 04:24:53.000 align:start position:0%
want to look it up some statistics and
 
04:24:55.030 --> 04:24:55.040 align:start position:0%
other data at recruiting stations in the
 
04:24:56.550 --> 04:24:56.560 align:start position:0%
DMV that would have been really
 
04:24:57.830 --> 04:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
detrimental to
 
04:25:00.149 --> 04:25:00.159 align:start position:0%
recruiting um and that bill was found
 
04:25:02.550 --> 04:25:02.560 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate as well as
 
04:25:03.950 --> 04:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
04:25:07.790 --> 04:25:07.800 align:start position:0%
1338 which would have uh restricted
 
04:25:10.429 --> 04:25:10.439 align:start position:0%
information flow back to the federal
 
04:25:12.469 --> 04:25:12.479 align:start position:0%
government for Selective Service would
 
04:25:15.710 --> 04:25:15.720 align:start position:0%
have provided a a a check form at the
 
04:25:18.389 --> 04:25:18.399 align:start position:0%
DMV where somebody could register as a
 
04:25:20.469 --> 04:25:20.479 align:start position:0%
conscientious objector which is not the
 
04:25:22.830 --> 04:25:22.840 align:start position:0%
process at all there is a process to
 
04:25:24.830 --> 04:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
become a conscientious objector that is
 
04:25:27.910 --> 04:25:27.920 align:start position:0%
not it there's a board process for it
 
04:25:30.710 --> 04:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
okay and then also remove the penalties
 
04:25:32.550 --> 04:25:32.560 align:start position:0%
which is kind of what you see in front
 
04:25:34.630 --> 04:25:34.640 align:start position:0%
of you today has been scaled down from
 
04:25:38.229 --> 04:25:38.239 align:start position:0%
1338 to just removing the penalties here
 
04:25:40.750 --> 04:25:40.760 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire for failure to register
 
04:25:42.870 --> 04:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
with Selective Service
 
04:25:44.990 --> 04:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
to be honest and and and representative
 
04:25:46.910 --> 04:25:46.920 align:start position:0%
man you probably back this up we didn't
 
04:25:48.630 --> 04:25:48.640 align:start position:0%
discuss this for very long at our
 
04:25:50.349 --> 04:25:50.359 align:start position:0%
meeting he was at the meeting where we
 
04:25:55.070 --> 04:25:55.080 align:start position:0%
talked about this um to us it just feels
 
04:25:57.990 --> 04:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
like when you take the penalties away
 
04:26:00.269 --> 04:26:00.279 align:start position:0%
from this Selective Service thing at the
 
04:26:02.469 --> 04:26:02.479 align:start position:0%
federal level what you're doing is
 
04:26:04.429 --> 04:26:04.439 align:start position:0%
you're sort of trying to enable people
 
04:26:06.550 --> 04:26:06.560 align:start position:0%
to do the wrong thing and that feels
 
04:26:09.510 --> 04:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
wrong to us and that that that was a lot
 
04:26:12.269 --> 04:26:12.279 align:start position:0%
of what the the sentiment was that was
 
04:26:15.109 --> 04:26:15.119 align:start position:0%
coming out of the room is it's just it
 
04:26:17.149 --> 04:26:17.159 align:start position:0%
it it's like you found a lot the federal
 
04:26:19.630 --> 04:26:19.640 align:start position:0%
level and you're you're really
 
04:26:22.670 --> 04:26:22.680 align:start position:0%
essentially at at the State House level
 
04:26:25.109 --> 04:26:25.119 align:start position:0%
kind of powerless to affect that so what
 
04:26:26.309 --> 04:26:26.319 align:start position:0%
we're going to do is we're just going to
 
04:26:27.710 --> 04:26:27.720 align:start position:0%
sort of chip away at it and we're going
 
04:26:30.710 --> 04:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
to give people an opportunity to
 
04:26:33.149 --> 04:26:33.159 align:start position:0%
potentially ignore this and still
 
04:26:34.710 --> 04:26:34.720 align:start position:0%
qualify for higher education in the
 
04:26:37.790 --> 04:26:37.800 align:start position:0%
state still qualify for state jobs those
 
04:26:39.269 --> 04:26:39.279 align:start position:0%
those kind of things so that it just
 
04:26:41.309 --> 04:26:41.319 align:start position:0%
kind of felt like you know we're not
 
04:26:43.870 --> 04:26:43.880 align:start position:0%
doing the right thing when nobody's
 
04:26:45.389 --> 04:26:45.399 align:start position:0%
looking you know we are that's that's
 
04:26:47.070 --> 04:26:47.080 align:start position:0%
kind of our Mantra in the military you
 
04:26:48.389 --> 04:26:48.399 align:start position:0%
got to do the right thing all the time
 
04:26:51.189 --> 04:26:51.199 align:start position:0%
even when nobody's looking um if you
 
04:26:54.590 --> 04:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
wanted to encourage our Congressional
 
04:26:58.349 --> 04:26:58.359 align:start position:0%
Delegation to say we haven't draft
 
04:27:01.149 --> 04:27:01.159 align:start position:0%
anybody since 1973 okay I was a
 
04:27:02.630 --> 04:27:02.640 align:start position:0%
sophomore at the Air Force Academy when
 
04:27:05.349 --> 04:27:05.359 align:start position:0%
we last drafted somebody if you wanted
 
04:27:07.950 --> 04:27:07.960 align:start position:0%
to say that this thing is a time is come
 
04:27:09.790 --> 04:27:09.800 align:start position:0%
and gone we've got an all volunteer
 
04:27:11.389 --> 04:27:11.399 align:start position:0%
Force as general told you this morning
 
04:27:13.630 --> 04:27:13.640 align:start position:0%
we're currently making our recruiting
 
04:27:15.670 --> 04:27:15.680 align:start position:0%
quotas and all those the chances of this
 
04:27:18.389 --> 04:27:18.399 align:start position:0%
being used are very small very small the
 
04:27:20.990 --> 04:27:21.000 align:start position:0%
chances of a World War III scenario in
 
04:27:22.950 --> 04:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
my opinion as a military professional
 
04:27:25.710 --> 04:27:25.720 align:start position:0%
lasting more than a couple three days
 
04:27:28.790 --> 04:27:28.800 align:start position:0%
are are are remote they're really remote
 
04:27:30.870 --> 04:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
okay I I noticed the chairman LEP and I
 
04:27:32.229 --> 04:27:32.239 align:start position:0%
think he might agree with me on that a
 
04:27:34.269 --> 04:27:34.279 align:start position:0%
World War II scenario is is not going to
 
04:27:36.790 --> 04:27:36.800 align:start position:0%
last long at all not long enough to
 
04:27:39.750 --> 04:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
recruit not to to draft and train people
 
04:27:41.830 --> 04:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
okay so if you wanted to say that this
 
04:27:44.109 --> 04:27:44.119 align:start position:0%
this is is a law that's come and gone we
 
04:27:45.630 --> 04:27:45.640 align:start position:0%
could have that discussion at the state
 
04:27:47.469 --> 04:27:47.479 align:start position:0%
veterans advisory committee and if you
 
04:27:49.670 --> 04:27:49.680 align:start position:0%
wanted to say that you know what fair is
 
04:27:51.349 --> 04:27:51.359 align:start position:0%
fair and if we're going to make our
 
04:27:53.149 --> 04:27:53.159 align:start position:0%
young men register for Selective Service
 
04:27:54.870 --> 04:27:54.880 align:start position:0%
we ought to make our young women
 
04:27:57.070 --> 04:27:57.080 align:start position:0%
register for Selective Service as well
 
04:27:59.389 --> 04:27:59.399 align:start position:0%
we could have that discussion as well
 
04:28:01.910 --> 04:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
but this just to us feels like we're
 
04:28:04.189 --> 04:28:04.199 align:start position:0%
trying to do the wrong thing and that's
 
04:28:05.830 --> 04:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
that's really I'm trying to convey to
 
04:28:08.070 --> 04:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
you sort of the the feel that I got from
 
04:28:10.189 --> 04:28:10.199 align:start position:0%
the room that day and that and that was
 
04:28:12.830 --> 04:28:12.840 align:start position:0%
it so subject to your questions
 
04:28:14.389 --> 04:28:14.399 align:start position:0%
that's all I wanted to tell
 
04:28:17.870 --> 04:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
you are there any
 
04:28:20.389 --> 04:28:20.399 align:start position:0%
questions uh I have one miss gr which
 
04:28:21.830 --> 04:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
you may not be able to answer maybe
 
04:28:26.030 --> 04:28:26.040 align:start position:0%
someone else can um I'm wondering about
 
04:28:28.710 --> 04:28:28.720 align:start position:0%
the current infrastructure to uh
 
04:28:31.750 --> 04:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
maintain the Selective Service uh
 
04:28:34.309 --> 04:28:34.319 align:start position:0%
Administration or whatever again we've
 
04:28:37.950 --> 04:28:37.960 align:start position:0%
said several times it ended uh 52 years
 
04:28:42.510 --> 04:28:42.520 align:start position:0%
ago which and I which I remember that um
 
04:28:46.030 --> 04:28:46.040 align:start position:0%
are there any Selective Service Federal
 
04:28:48.710 --> 04:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
Personnel types in New Hampshire I I
 
04:28:49.830 --> 04:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
don't know that's that's what I'm
 
04:28:52.189 --> 04:28:52.199 align:start position:0%
wondering is well you may not know
 
04:28:56.710 --> 04:28:56.720 align:start position:0%
either but Leo does know um as as chair
 
04:29:00.229 --> 04:29:00.239 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna uh ask him to come up and
 
04:29:03.670 --> 04:29:03.680 align:start position:0%
answer this question because uh I think
 
04:29:05.269 --> 04:29:05.279 align:start position:0%
it's of interest to more than just
 
04:29:09.030 --> 04:29:09.040 align:start position:0%
myself H how how big is this Selective
 
04:29:12.229 --> 04:29:12.239 align:start position:0%
Service infrastructure that's
 
04:29:15.870 --> 04:29:15.880 align:start position:0%
maintaining the a skeleton operation in
 
04:29:18.030 --> 04:29:18.040 align:start position:0%
case we ever need it and are there any
 
04:29:21.349 --> 04:29:21.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire employees of that uh yes
 
04:29:23.910 --> 04:29:23.920 align:start position:0%
sir um so the answer is yes Leo pin uh
 
04:29:25.429 --> 04:29:25.439 align:start position:0%
uh State Venture advisory committee
 
04:29:28.510 --> 04:29:28.520 align:start position:0%
chairman um I'm actually on the local
 
04:29:30.630 --> 04:29:30.640 align:start position:0%
Selective Service board so if there were
 
04:29:33.070 --> 04:29:33.080 align:start position:0%
to be a draft um on one of the people
 
04:29:34.309 --> 04:29:34.319 align:start position:0%
that would sit on the board that you
 
04:29:35.590 --> 04:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
would sit in front of to become a
 
04:29:37.710 --> 04:29:37.720 align:start position:0%
conscientious ejector so there isn't
 
04:29:39.149 --> 04:29:39.159 align:start position:0%
like you just one day say I'm a
 
04:29:40.870 --> 04:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
consciences ejector what happens is you
 
04:29:42.510 --> 04:29:42.520 align:start position:0%
register for the draft that that starts
 
04:29:45.510 --> 04:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
the process and then once there is a
 
04:29:47.269 --> 04:29:47.279 align:start position:0%
draft then you can say I'm a
 
04:29:49.269 --> 04:29:49.279 align:start position:0%
conscientious ejector and it's not I
 
04:29:51.590 --> 04:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
don't want to fight or it could be I
 
04:29:53.510 --> 04:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
want to do non-competitive services so
 
04:29:55.349 --> 04:29:55.359 align:start position:0%
you can do something you have choices
 
04:29:57.469 --> 04:29:57.479 align:start position:0%
there are different tiers of uh
 
04:29:58.950 --> 04:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
conscientious obor it's not what you
 
04:30:00.510 --> 04:30:00.520 align:start position:0%
think like I just don't want to ever
 
04:30:02.630 --> 04:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
touch a gun there could be people like I
 
04:30:04.149 --> 04:30:04.159 align:start position:0%
I would love to be a medic I never want
 
04:30:05.269 --> 04:30:05.279 align:start position:0%
to touch a gun but I'd love to be a
 
04:30:06.510 --> 04:30:06.520 align:start position:0%
medic in the military there are people
 
04:30:07.990 --> 04:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
that say I don't want to serve in the
 
04:30:09.990 --> 04:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
military but I'm willing to do a mar cor
 
04:30:11.070 --> 04:30:11.080 align:start position:0%
or something like that so there's
 
04:30:12.550 --> 04:30:12.560 align:start position:0%
different tiers and
 
04:30:14.630 --> 04:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
the boards still exist my most of them
 
04:30:16.590 --> 04:30:16.600 align:start position:0%
are volunteer but there are uh federal
 
04:30:18.950 --> 04:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
employees as well if I could ask are you
 
04:30:21.109 --> 04:30:21.119 align:start position:0%
a volunteer or are you paid by the no no
 
04:30:23.229 --> 04:30:23.239 align:start position:0%
I'm a volunteer okay yeah most of the
 
04:30:25.269 --> 04:30:25.279 align:start position:0%
now most of the positions nowadays are
 
04:30:28.189 --> 04:30:28.199 align:start position:0%
volunteers do you know how big the in in
 
04:30:29.830 --> 04:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
presumably in DC how big the
 
04:30:31.870 --> 04:30:31.880 align:start position:0%
infrastructure is of the structure of
 
04:30:34.830 --> 04:30:34.840 align:start position:0%
the selective service operation he you
 
04:30:36.590 --> 04:30:36.600 align:start position:0%
know we're we're we're small fish in a
 
04:30:38.189 --> 04:30:38.199 align:start position:0%
big pond in New Hampshire but I happen
 
04:30:39.830 --> 04:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
to know I mean the board I was the
 
04:30:42.070 --> 04:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
training I did recently about every two
 
04:30:43.429 --> 04:30:43.439 align:start position:0%
years they do a whole training and the
 
04:30:44.710 --> 04:30:44.720 align:start position:0%
and the scenarios are extremely
 
04:30:46.710 --> 04:30:46.720 align:start position:0%
interesting and they're actually prior
 
04:30:49.229 --> 04:30:49.239 align:start position:0%
cases of people becoming Cons projectors
 
04:30:51.189 --> 04:30:51.199 align:start position:0%

attacks on the US soil there's never a
 
04:31:53.670 --> 04:31:53.680 align:start position:0%
problem with you know Pearl Harbor 911
 
04:31:55.990 --> 04:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
people were signing up like crazy when
 
04:31:58.790 --> 04:31:58.800 align:start position:0%
it comes to overseas interventions
 
04:32:03.830 --> 04:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
people are would obviously be uh would
 
04:32:05.309 --> 04:32:05.319 align:start position:0%
it would be you know they have to think
 
04:32:06.750 --> 04:32:06.760 align:start position:0%
about it a lot more they wouldn't be
 
04:32:08.710 --> 04:32:08.720 align:start position:0%
volunteering so I don't think there's a
 
04:32:12.750 --> 04:32:12.760 align:start position:0%
problem the volunteer army works now now
 
04:32:15.349 --> 04:32:15.359 align:start position:0%
the question really becomes does your
 
04:32:18.070 --> 04:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
body belong to you or does it belong to
 
04:32:20.670 --> 04:32:20.680 align:start position:0%
the state if you believe that it belongs
 
04:32:24.309 --> 04:32:24.319 align:start position:0%
to you then we should not limit uh young
 
04:32:27.349 --> 04:32:27.359 align:start position:0%
men's opportunities to go to a state
 
04:32:29.349 --> 04:32:29.359 align:start position:0%
college or university apply for a
 
04:32:32.590 --> 04:32:32.600 align:start position:0%
tax-funded uh student loan or to apply
 
04:32:36.590 --> 04:32:36.600 align:start position:0%
for a state or I even a municipal job
 
04:32:39.109 --> 04:32:39.119 align:start position:0%
because they did not want to basically
 
04:32:42.990 --> 04:32:43.000 align:start position:0%
sign your life away um any part of the
 
04:32:43.000 --> 04:32:44.590 align:start position:0%
sign your life away um any part of the
selective

04:32:44.590 --> 04:32:44.600 align:start position:0%
selective
 
04:32:49.030 --> 04:32:49.040 align:start position:0%
service is um it's anical to the 13th
 
04:32:51.309 --> 04:32:51.319 align:start position:0%
Amendment which
 
04:32:55.429 --> 04:32:55.439 align:start position:0%
says neither slavery nor involuntary
 
04:32:58.070 --> 04:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
servitude except as a punishment of a
 
04:33:02.030 --> 04:33:02.040 align:start position:0%
crime whereof the property the party
 
04:33:04.109 --> 04:33:04.119 align:start position:0%
shall have been duly convicted shall
 
04:33:06.189 --> 04:33:06.199 align:start position:0%
exist within the United States or any
 
04:33:08.310 --> 04:33:08.320 align:start position:0%
place subject to their
 
04:33:11.269 --> 04:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction so and I know people might
 
04:33:11.279 --> 04:33:12.269 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction so and I know people might
say

04:33:12.269 --> 04:33:12.279 align:start position:0%
say
 
04:33:14.990 --> 04:33:15.000 align:start position:0%
well you're just signing up for it it
 
04:33:16.990 --> 04:33:17.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't really mean that you're they're
 
04:33:19.629 --> 04:33:19.639 align:start position:0%
not taking your body yet that's the same
 
04:33:21.869 --> 04:33:21.879 align:start position:0%
as gun registration why do they have
 
04:33:23.551 --> 04:33:23.561 align:start position:0%
people sign up for gun they're not
 
04:33:25.789 --> 04:33:25.799 align:start position:0%
really going to take your guns it's so
 
04:33:28.230 --> 04:33:28.240 align:start position:0%
they can grab on to it if they need it
 
04:33:30.470 --> 04:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
that's what it's there for we don't need
 
04:33:33.510 --> 04:33:33.520 align:start position:0%
it it's evil you either your body
 
04:33:35.750 --> 04:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
belongs to you or not it does not belong
 
04:33:38.029 --> 04:33:38.039 align:start position:0%
to the state we should not comply New
 
04:33:40.709 --> 04:33:40.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire should not comply period
 
04:33:42.390 --> 04:33:42.400 align:start position:0%
That's why I support this
 
04:33:44.709 --> 04:33:44.719 align:start position:0%

04:34:18.150 --> 04:34:18.160 align:start position:0%
my name is Eric brai uh I uh very
 
04:34:20.109 --> 04:34:20.119 align:start position:0%
recently moved to do New Hamshire where
 
04:34:22.590 --> 04:34:22.600 align:start position:0%
I'm a resident now prior to that I uh
 
04:34:25.470 --> 04:34:25.480 align:start position:0%
just completed my third term in the main
 
04:34:27.709 --> 04:34:27.719 align:start position:0%
State Senate next door in the pine tree
 
04:34:30.590 --> 04:34:30.600 align:start position:0%
state but I'm happy to be a resident of
 
04:34:34.150 --> 04:34:34.160 align:start position:0%
the livre or die state today um I'm also
 
04:34:35.390 --> 04:34:35.400 align:start position:0%
the executive director of the New
 
04:34:37.230 --> 04:34:37.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire freest state project but I am
 
04:34:39.310 --> 04:34:39.320 align:start position:0%
here in my individual capacity not on
 
04:34:42.830 --> 04:34:42.840 align:start position:0%
behalf of any uh organization
 
04:34:44.551 --> 04:34:44.561 align:start position:0%
I I thought I might add a little bit of
 
04:34:48.510 --> 04:34:48.520 align:start position:0%
historical context to uh uh to these
 
04:34:48.520 --> 04:34:49.910 align:start position:0%
historical context to uh uh to these
deliberations

04:34:49.910 --> 04:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
deliberations
 
04:34:52.189 --> 04:34:52.199 align:start position:0%
today I think it's worth noting in the
 
04:34:55.429 --> 04:34:55.439 align:start position:0%
context of military conscription that um
 
04:34:58.709 --> 04:34:58.719 align:start position:0%
military conscription was not uh a part
 
04:35:01.551 --> 04:35:01.561 align:start position:0%
of our um our federal government it was
 
04:35:03.310 --> 04:35:03.320 align:start position:0%
not utilized by our federal government
 
04:35:05.629 --> 04:35:05.639 align:start position:0%
since the establishment of the US
 
04:35:08.910 --> 04:35:08.920 align:start position:0%
Constitution for most of the for
 
04:35:11.429 --> 04:35:11.439 align:start position:0%
basically the first hundred years or so
 
04:35:13.830 --> 04:35:13.840 align:start position:0%
um it was not until the Civil War that
 
04:35:16.269 --> 04:35:16.279 align:start position:0%
conscription was first used though many
 
04:35:17.830 --> 04:35:17.840 align:start position:0%
historians regard it as having actually
 
04:35:19.789 --> 04:35:19.799 align:start position:0%
been counterproductive it led to draft
 
04:35:22.990 --> 04:35:23.000 align:start position:0%
riots and there wasn't really difficulty
 
04:35:25.709 --> 04:35:25.719 align:start position:0%
uh getting um volunteers during that War
 
04:35:27.390 --> 04:35:27.400 align:start position:0%
I didn't really come into full practice
 
04:35:29.750 --> 04:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
until World War I and I think that
 
04:35:33.150 --> 04:35:33.160 align:start position:0%
history Bears out that conscription has
 
04:35:36.629 --> 04:35:36.639 align:start position:0%
only really been necessary I mean I
 
04:35:37.990 --> 04:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
guess necessary depends on your
 
04:35:42.510 --> 04:35:42.520 align:start position:0%
perspective um for unpopular Wars um as
 
04:35:44.310 --> 04:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
I think was previously noted when we are
 
04:35:45.910 --> 04:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
attacked or when people feel that there
 
04:35:48.590 --> 04:35:48.600 align:start position:0%
is a actual truly compelling threat to
 
04:35:51.269 --> 04:35:51.279 align:start position:0%
American Security there there are no
 
04:35:53.230 --> 04:35:53.240 align:start position:0%
shortage of volunteers willing to stand
 
04:35:55.590 --> 04:35:55.600 align:start position:0%
up and fight for their country uh but
 
04:35:58.150 --> 04:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
certainly at times like right now when
 
04:36:00.470 --> 04:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
we have gone through 20 years of very
 
04:36:03.830 --> 04:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
unpopular Wars with unarticulated
 
04:36:06.590 --> 04:36:06.600 align:start position:0%
missions and no Declarations of war from
 
04:36:08.830 --> 04:36:08.840 align:start position:0%
Congress certainly it is getting harder
 
04:36:10.470 --> 04:36:10.480 align:start position:0%
and harder for the military to recruit
 
04:36:12.629 --> 04:36:12.639 align:start position:0%
people to go off and fight these wars
 
04:36:14.429 --> 04:36:14.439 align:start position:0%
and I think this is why today in
 
04:36:16.189 --> 04:36:16.199 align:start position:0%
Congress you do hear more and more talk
 
04:36:18.709 --> 04:36:18.719 align:start position:0%
about bringing back the military draft
 
04:36:20.390 --> 04:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
uh but it is worth noting that the
 
04:36:22.230 --> 04:36:22.240 align:start position:0%
military draft has not been an act of
 
04:36:24.029 --> 04:36:24.039 align:start position:0%
use even though it is on the books has
 
04:36:25.629 --> 04:36:25.639 align:start position:0%
not been an act of use since the end of
 
04:36:27.869 --> 04:36:27.879 align:start position:0%
the Vietnam War there were actually very
 
04:36:29.830 --> 04:36:29.840 align:start position:0%
famous debates about this between Milton
 
04:36:32.750 --> 04:36:32.760 align:start position:0%
fredman and General West Morland on a
 
04:36:34.869 --> 04:36:34.879 align:start position:0%
commission that was um commissioned by
 
04:36:36.949 --> 04:36:36.959 align:start position:0%
President Nixon to study the
 
04:36:39.029 --> 04:36:39.039 align:start position:0%
effectiveness of the draft I think one
 
04:36:42.750 --> 04:36:42.760 align:start position:0%
of the um uh very enlightening moments
 
04:36:44.510 --> 04:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
in those debates was General West
 
04:36:48.070 --> 04:36:48.080 align:start position:0%
Morland saying uh to to Milton fredman
 
04:36:50.390 --> 04:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
uh that I do not want to command an army
 
04:36:53.590 --> 04:36:53.600 align:start position:0%
of mercenaries degrading the idea of a
 
04:36:55.789 --> 04:36:55.799 align:start position:0%
volunteer service where people are there
 
04:36:57.109 --> 04:36:57.119 align:start position:0%
because it's their job and they're paid
 
04:36:59.750 --> 04:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
for it to which Milton fredman replied
 
04:37:02.070 --> 04:37:02.080 align:start position:0%
better an army of mercenaries than an
 
04:37:05.029 --> 04:37:05.039 align:start position:0%
army of slaves and let's understand that
 
04:37:07.949 --> 04:37:07.959 align:start position:0%
that's exactly the you know the the Crux
 
04:37:10.590 --> 04:37:10.600 align:start position:0%
of this right when we um when we are
 
04:37:13.670 --> 04:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
talking about involuntary conscription
 
04:37:16.429 --> 04:37:16.439 align:start position:0%
uh people being forced to uh to en
 
04:37:18.310 --> 04:37:18.320 align:start position:0%
enlist and go off and fight in a war
 
04:37:20.189 --> 04:37:20.199 align:start position:0%
that they have perhaps do not believe in
 
04:37:21.910 --> 04:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
and do not choose to participate in that
 
04:37:24.429 --> 04:37:24.439 align:start position:0%
is a form of slavery and I just want to
 
04:37:28.070 --> 04:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
hearken back actually to um during the
 
04:37:30.150 --> 04:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
War of 1812 I think there was a very
 
04:37:32.551 --> 04:37:32.561 align:start position:0%
poignant moment of debate in in Congress
 
04:37:36.470 --> 04:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
actually um and one of the preeminent
 
04:37:38.310 --> 04:37:38.320 align:start position:0%
figures in this was a famous New
 
04:37:42.029 --> 04:37:42.039 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Statesman uh Daniel Webster
 
04:37:44.830 --> 04:37:44.840 align:start position:0%
uh there was a push to Institute a draft
 
04:37:46.510 --> 04:37:46.520 align:start position:0%
for the first time under the United
 
04:37:48.750 --> 04:37:48.760 align:start position:0%
States government for the War of 1812
 
04:37:50.150 --> 04:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
when we were actually being actively
 
04:37:51.670 --> 04:37:51.680 align:start position:0%
invaded by the British and the White
 
04:37:53.949 --> 04:37:53.959 align:start position:0%
House was being burned down and yet even
 
04:37:56.590 --> 04:37:56.600 align:start position:0%
still Daniel Webster stood up and I just
 
04:37:58.590 --> 04:37:58.600 align:start position:0%
want to share some of his words and then
 
04:38:00.029 --> 04:38:00.039 align:start position:0%
I'll be done and I'd be happy to take
 
04:38:02.470 --> 04:38:02.480 align:start position:0%
any questions that you have so this was
 
04:38:05.029 --> 04:38:05.039 align:start position:0%
what he had to say in Congress about the
 
04:38:05.039 --> 04:38:07.109 align:start position:0%
what he had to say in Congress about the
proposed

04:38:07.109 --> 04:38:07.119 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
04:38:09.709 --> 04:38:09.719 align:start position:0%
conscription is this sir consistent with
 
04:38:11.990 --> 04:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
the character of a free government
 
04:38:14.709 --> 04:38:14.719 align:start position:0%
is this civil liberty is this the real
 
04:38:16.869 --> 04:38:16.879 align:start position:0%
character of our constitution no sir
 
04:38:19.551 --> 04:38:19.561 align:start position:0%
indeed it is not the Constitution is
 
04:38:22.230 --> 04:38:22.240 align:start position:0%
Lial fouly Lial the people of this
 
04:38:23.830 --> 04:38:23.840 align:start position:0%
country have not established for
 
04:38:26.109 --> 04:38:26.119 align:start position:0%
themselves such a fabric of despotism
 
04:38:27.990 --> 04:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
they have not purchased at a vast
 
04:38:29.830 --> 04:38:29.840 align:start position:0%
expense of their own treasure and their
 
04:38:32.510 --> 04:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
own blood of Magna Carta to be slaves
 
04:38:34.590 --> 04:38:34.600 align:start position:0%
where is it written in the Constitution
 
04:38:36.789 --> 04:38:36.799 align:start position:0%
and what article or section is a contain
 
04:38:38.269 --> 04:38:38.279 align:start position:0%
that you may take children from their
 
04:38:39.990 --> 04:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
parents and parents from their children
 
04:38:41.869 --> 04:38:41.879 align:start position:0%
and compel them to fight the the battles
 
04:38:44.070 --> 04:38:44.080 align:start position:0%
of any war in which the folly or the
 
04:38:46.429 --> 04:38:46.439 align:start position:0%
wickedness of government May engage it
 
04:38:49.029 --> 04:38:49.039 align:start position:0%
under what concealment has this power
 
04:38:51.590 --> 04:38:51.600 align:start position:0%
Lane hidden which now for the first time
 
04:38:53.551 --> 04:38:53.561 align:start position:0%
comes forth with a tremendous and
 
04:38:55.750 --> 04:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
baleful aspect to trample down and
 
04:38:57.750 --> 04:38:57.760 align:start position:0%
destroy the dearest rights of personal
 
04:38:59.990 --> 04:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
Liberty who will show me any
 
04:39:02.070 --> 04:39:02.080 align:start position:0%
constitutional injunction which makes it
 
04:39:03.670 --> 04:39:03.680 align:start position:0%
the duty of the American people to
 
04:39:05.910 --> 04:39:05.920 align:start position:0%
surrender everything valuable in life
 
04:39:08.510 --> 04:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
and even life itself not when the safety
 
04:39:10.269 --> 04:39:10.279 align:start position:0%
of their country and its Liberties May
 
04:39:12.029 --> 04:39:12.039 align:start position:0%
demand the sacrifice but whenever the
 
04:39:14.551 --> 04:39:14.561 align:start position:0%
purposes of an ambitious and mischievous
 
04:39:17.470 --> 04:39:17.480 align:start position:0%
government may require it nor is it sir
 
04:39:19.150 --> 04:39:19.160 align:start position:0%
for the defense of his own house and
 
04:39:21.029 --> 04:39:21.039 align:start position:0%
home that he who is the subject of
 
04:39:23.470 --> 04:39:23.480 align:start position:0%
military draft is to perform the task
 
04:39:26.109 --> 04:39:26.119 align:start position:0%
allotted to him you will put upon him a
 
04:39:28.910 --> 04:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
service uh equally foreign to his
 
04:39:31.429 --> 04:39:31.439 align:start position:0%
interests and abhorent to his feelings
 
04:39:33.230 --> 04:39:33.240 align:start position:0%
with his Aid you are to push your
 
04:39:35.869 --> 04:39:35.879 align:start position:0%
purposes of Conquest the battles which
 
04:39:37.750 --> 04:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
he is to fight are the battles of
 
04:39:40.230 --> 04:39:40.240 align:start position:0%
invasion battles which he detests
 
04:39:42.910 --> 04:39:42.920 align:start position:0%
perhaps and uphor less the danger and
 
04:39:44.750 --> 04:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
the death that gathers over them and the
 
04:39:47.670 --> 04:39:47.680 align:start position:0%
blood with which they drench the plane
 
04:39:49.510 --> 04:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
than from the principles in which they
 
04:39:51.510 --> 04:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
have their origin fresh from the
 
04:39:53.628 --> 04:39:53.638 align:start position:0%
peaceful Pursuits of life and yet a
 
04:39:57.070 --> 04:39:57.080 align:start position:0%
soldier but in name but he is opposed to
 
04:39:59.110 --> 04:39:59.120 align:start position:0%
veteran troops hardened under every
 
04:40:02.150 --> 04:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
scene inured to every privation and
 
04:40:04.788 --> 04:40:04.798 align:start position:0%
disciplined in every service if sir in
 
04:40:07.390 --> 04:40:07.400 align:start position:0%
The Strife he fall if while ready to
 
04:40:09.030 --> 04:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
obey every rightful command of
 
04:40:11.110 --> 04:40:11.120 align:start position:0%
government he is forced from his home
 
04:40:12.830 --> 04:40:12.840 align:start position:0%
against against right not to contend for
 
04:40:14.430 --> 04:40:14.440 align:start position:0%
the defense of his country but to
 
04:40:16.868 --> 04:40:16.878 align:start position:0%
prosecute a miserable and detestable
 
04:40:19.310 --> 04:40:19.320 align:start position:0%
project of invasion and if in that
 
04:40:22.310 --> 04:40:22.320 align:start position:0%
Strife he fault is murder it may stalk
 
04:40:24.510 --> 04:40:24.520 align:start position:0%
above the cognizance of human law but in
 
04:40:26.628 --> 04:40:26.638 align:start position:0%
the sight of Heaven it is murder and
 
04:40:28.750 --> 04:40:28.760 align:start position:0%
though millions of years May roll away
 
04:40:30.990 --> 04:40:31.000 align:start position:0%
while his ashes and yours lie mingled
 
04:40:33.230 --> 04:40:33.240 align:start position:0%
together in the Earth the day will yet
 
04:40:35.230 --> 04:40:35.240 align:start position:0%
come when his Spirit and the spirits of
 
04:40:37.550 --> 04:40:37.560 align:start position:0%
his children must be met at the bar of
 
04:40:39.788 --> 04:40:39.798 align:start position:0%
omnipotent Justice may God and His
 
04:40:41.830 --> 04:40:41.840 align:start position:0%
compassion Shield me from any
 
04:40:44.788 --> 04:40:44.798 align:start position:0%
participation in the enormity of this
 
04:40:47.030 --> 04:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
guilt they don't make him in Congress
 
04:40:48.550 --> 04:40:48.560 align:start position:0%
like that anymore I will say Daniel
 
04:40:51.110 --> 04:40:51.120 align:start position:0%
Webster was truly an amazing figure of
 
04:40:54.270 --> 04:40:54.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um thank you for listening
 
04:40:56.750 --> 04:40:56.760 align:start position:0%
to me um and um and for hearing this
 
04:40:58.708 --> 04:40:58.718 align:start position:0%
bill if there are questions I'm happy to
 
04:41:00.190 --> 04:41:00.200 align:start position:0%
take them otherwise I'm happy to go sit
 
04:41:04.310 --> 04:41:04.320 align:start position:0%
back down again thank you Mr brei the uh
 
04:41:07.990 --> 04:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
Daniel Webster uh oration you just read
 
04:41:10.150 --> 04:41:10.160 align:start position:0%
uh was very powerful he was born just up
 
04:41:11.948 --> 04:41:11.958 align:start position:0%
the road here as you probably know as
 
04:41:14.550 --> 04:41:14.560 align:start position:0%
you mentioned he is a granite stator uh
 
04:41:16.708 --> 04:41:16.718 align:start position:0%
I do want to point out that most of our
 
04:41:19.550 --> 04:41:19.560 align:start position:0%
NATO allies do have a draft or some form
 
04:41:22.830 --> 04:41:22.840 align:start position:0%
of uh uh compulsory
 
04:41:25.750 --> 04:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
Service uh some of the models in our
 
04:41:28.310 --> 04:41:28.320 align:start position:0%
that our allies have involve uh
 
04:41:31.150 --> 04:41:31.160 align:start position:0%
compulsory national service short of
 
04:41:33.590 --> 04:41:33.600 align:start position:0%
they have options they can go into a
 
04:41:36.990 --> 04:41:37.000 align:start position:0%
military area or non-military service
 
04:41:39.868 --> 04:41:39.878 align:start position:0%
area um and there have been proposals in
 
04:41:42.150 --> 04:41:42.160 align:start position:0%
our country to look at that type of
 
04:41:46.430 --> 04:41:46.440 align:start position:0%
model if if we ever adopted a
 
04:41:50.230 --> 04:41:50.240 align:start position:0%
compulsory a non-military uh compulsory
 
04:41:53.350 --> 04:41:53.360 align:start position:0%
service option would that is exists
 
04:41:55.550 --> 04:41:55.560 align:start position:0%
elsewhere would that make any difference
 
04:41:59.270 --> 04:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
as to how you would would look at
 
04:42:01.310 --> 04:42:01.320 align:start position:0%
this well I mean I guess if we're
 
04:42:03.470 --> 04:42:03.480 align:start position:0%
measuring against the status quo I I
 
04:42:05.310 --> 04:42:05.320 align:start position:0%
would say certainly it's it's would be
 
04:42:06.948 --> 04:42:06.958 align:start position:0%
better for people have the choice not to
 
04:42:10.310 --> 04:42:10.320 align:start position:0%
go into a a a combat role if they have
 
04:42:12.510 --> 04:42:12.520 align:start position:0%
moral objections to it but I I would
 
04:42:14.470 --> 04:42:14.480 align:start position:0%
still morally object to the underlying
 
04:42:16.948 --> 04:42:16.958 align:start position:0%
principle that people should be coerced
 
04:42:21.030 --> 04:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
and forced into um aversion of slavery
 
04:42:22.390 --> 04:42:22.400 align:start position:0%
uh that is not that they're not
 
04:42:24.230 --> 04:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
voluntarily choosing for themselves
 
04:42:26.030 --> 04:42:26.040 align:start position:0%
again I think that history Bears out
 
04:42:30.910 --> 04:42:30.920 align:start position:0%
that um when the public feels that a uh
 
04:42:34.470 --> 04:42:34.480 align:start position:0%
a conflict is based on a real threat to
 
04:42:36.830 --> 04:42:36.840 align:start position:0%
to America responding to a real Attack
 
04:42:39.190 --> 04:42:39.200 align:start position:0%
on American soil or real American
 
04:42:41.788 --> 04:42:41.798 align:start position:0%
interests are at stake uh in tangible
 
04:42:43.350 --> 04:42:43.360 align:start position:0%
way and there is a mission that is
 
04:42:45.230 --> 04:42:45.240 align:start position:0%
clearly articulated and laid out there's
 
04:42:47.030 --> 04:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
no shortage of people who are willing to
 
04:42:49.830 --> 04:42:49.840 align:start position:0%
stand up and fight for
 
04:42:53.750 --> 04:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:56.550 --> 04:42:56.560 align:start position:0%
questions Sani thank you again for your
 
04:42:59.590 --> 04:42:59.600 align:start position:0%

representative uh Perez welcome hi I
 
04:43:11.230 --> 04:43:11.240 align:start position:0%
wasn't going to speak on this but a very
 
04:43:13.750 --> 04:43:13.760 align:start position:0%
valid point came was brought up as far
 
04:43:17.430 --> 04:43:17.440 align:start position:0%
as I'm concerned this requirement of men
 
04:43:17.440 --> 04:43:19.948 align:start position:0%
as I'm concerned this requirement of men
is

04:43:19.948 --> 04:43:19.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:22.430 --> 04:43:22.440 align:start position:0%
discriminatory until we start making
 
04:43:25.470 --> 04:43:25.480 align:start position:0%

04:43:27.788 --> 04:43:27.798 align:start position:0%
up it's
 
04:43:29.750 --> 04:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
discriminatory that was brought up by
 
04:43:32.310 --> 04:43:32.320 align:start position:0%
the gentleman before me and maybe that's
 
04:43:35.190 --> 04:43:35.200 align:start position:0%
how we me need to do it so it's not but
 
04:43:36.910 --> 04:43:36.920 align:start position:0%
I think we should get rid of it all

six

04:45:09.948 --> 04:45:09.958 align:start position:0%
six
 
04:45:12.390 --> 04:45:12.400 align:start position:0%
Marines it was my experiences there that
 
04:45:14.628 --> 04:45:14.638 align:start position:0%
motivated me to learn about US foreign
 
04:45:18.030 --> 04:45:18.040 align:start position:0%
policy and got me interested in politics
 
04:45:19.830 --> 04:45:19.840 align:start position:0%
when I first heard about this bill last
 
04:45:22.350 --> 04:45:22.360 align:start position:0%
term I was it was entirely within my
 
04:45:24.190 --> 04:45:24.200 align:start position:0%
wheelhouse and I'm happy to bring it to
 
04:45:27.750 --> 04:45:27.760 align:start position:0%
this committee this term HB 104 known as
 
04:45:29.670 --> 04:45:29.680 align:start position:0%
the defend the guard act will prevent
 
04:45:31.310 --> 04:45:31.320 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire National Guard from
 
04:45:33.590 --> 04:45:33.600 align:start position:0%
being deployed to a combat zone without
 
04:45:36.270 --> 04:45:36.280 align:start position:0%
a formal declaration of war issued by
 
04:45:39.230 --> 04:45:39.240 align:start position:0%
Congress pursuant to Article 1 Section 8
 
04:45:41.868 --> 04:45:41.878 align:start position:0%
of the US Constitution I believe the
 
04:45:43.550 --> 04:45:43.560 align:start position:0%
premise is one that just about all of us
 
04:45:45.628 --> 04:45:45.638 align:start position:0%
can agree with so I'll focus on
 
04:45:49.150 --> 04:45:49.160 align:start position:0%
attacking the fiscal note firstly it
 
04:45:51.550 --> 04:45:51.560 align:start position:0%
mentions Federal funding may be put at
 
04:45:51.560 --> 04:45:52.628 align:start position:0%
mentions Federal funding may be put at
quote

04:45:52.628 --> 04:45:52.638 align:start position:0%
quote
 
04:45:54.470 --> 04:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
risk which is intentionally
 
04:45:56.788 --> 04:45:56.798 align:start position:0%
non-committal language and after a term
 
04:45:58.868 --> 04:45:58.878 align:start position:0%
here and conquered I've heard many other
 
04:46:00.470 --> 04:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
committees with regards to health
 
04:46:03.230 --> 04:46:03.240 align:start position:0%
mandates education policy vehicle
 
04:46:06.230 --> 04:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
inspections you name it whenever the
 
04:46:08.190 --> 04:46:08.200 align:start position:0%
legislature files a bill the executive
 
04:46:10.230 --> 04:46:10.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't like there's always they're
 
04:46:11.830 --> 04:46:11.840 align:start position:0%
always likely to roll out the old
 
04:46:14.948 --> 04:46:14.958 align:start position:0%
Federal money defense to try and stop it
 
04:46:17.150 --> 04:46:17.160 align:start position:0%
Congress writes the checks and no
 
04:46:18.948 --> 04:46:18.958 align:start position:0%
Congress person is going to commit
 
04:46:21.030 --> 04:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
political suicide to defending a state
 
04:46:23.030 --> 04:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
Guard unit especially with Senator
 
04:46:25.190 --> 04:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
Shaheen on the committee both
 
04:46:27.990 --> 04:46:28.000 align:start position:0%
Congressman gsar of Arizona and Massie
 
04:46:30.470 --> 04:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
of Kentucky have affirmed that no member
 
04:46:33.510 --> 04:46:33.520 align:start position:0%
of Congress will defund any state guard
 
04:46:36.190 --> 04:46:36.200 align:start position:0%
when asked specifically about this
 
04:46:38.230 --> 04:46:38.240 align:start position:0%
bill I'll be closing more with the
 
04:46:41.628 --> 04:46:41.638 align:start position:0%
fiscal note but bear with me secondly
 
04:46:43.350 --> 04:46:43.360 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note mentions what is known
 
04:46:46.750 --> 04:46:46.760 align:start position:0%
as the Montgomery amendment of 10 USC
 
04:46:50.670 --> 04:46:50.680 align:start position:0%
12301 F which which states the consent
 
04:46:53.310 --> 04:46:53.320 align:start position:0%
of a governor described in subsections B
 
04:46:56.590 --> 04:46:56.600 align:start position:0%
and D may not be withheld because of Any
 
04:46:59.430 --> 04:46:59.440 align:start position:0%
objection to location purpose type or
 
04:47:02.350 --> 04:47:02.360 align:start position:0%
schedule of such active duty we are not
 
04:47:05.430 --> 04:47:05.440 align:start position:0%
objecting on any of those grounds we are
 
04:47:07.470 --> 04:47:07.480 align:start position:0%
objecting on the constitutionality of
 
04:47:09.628 --> 04:47:09.638 align:start position:0%
the deployment if the purpose of the
 
04:47:11.868 --> 04:47:11.878 align:start position:0%
Montgomery Amendment was to completely
 
04:47:13.830 --> 04:47:13.840 align:start position:0%
remove the governor consent then
 
04:47:16.070 --> 04:47:16.080 align:start position:0%
subsections B and D would have been
 
04:47:19.350 --> 04:47:19.360 align:start position:0%
amended to remove consent requirement
 
04:47:21.788 --> 04:47:21.798 align:start position:0%
entirely would anyone here argue that
 
04:47:23.948 --> 04:47:23.958 align:start position:0%
Governor Nome could withhold consent on
 
04:47:27.030 --> 04:47:27.040 align:start position:0%
the grounds that his state is in
 
04:47:30.310 --> 04:47:30.320 align:start position:0%
crisis next the FIS fiscal note reads
 
04:47:35.150 --> 04:47:35.160 align:start position:0%
title 32 USC section 108 States quote if
 
04:47:37.270 --> 04:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
within the time fixed by the president a
 
04:47:39.548 --> 04:47:39.558 align:start position:0%
state fails to comply with a requirement
 
04:47:42.510 --> 04:47:42.520 align:start position:0%
of this type title or regulation
 
04:47:45.548 --> 04:47:45.558 align:start position:0%
described under this title the National
 
04:47:47.948 --> 04:47:47.958 align:start position:0%
Guard of the state is barred in whole or
 
04:47:50.470 --> 04:47:50.480 align:start position:0%
part as the president May prescribe from
 
04:47:53.670 --> 04:47:53.680 align:start position:0%
receiving money we are not prohibiting
 
04:47:57.670 --> 04:47:57.680 align:start position:0%
any title 32 activation the section says
 
04:48:00.948 --> 04:48:00.958 align:start position:0%
under this title twice meaning
 
04:48:04.510 --> 04:48:04.520 align:start position:0%
specifically title 32 activation title
 
04:48:09.310 --> 04:48:09.320 align:start position:0%
10 has no such provision now more policy
 
04:48:11.110 --> 04:48:11.120 align:start position:0%
time aums
 
04:48:13.670 --> 04:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
authorizations for use of military force
 
04:48:15.470 --> 04:48:15.480 align:start position:0%
are the very mechanism we are
 
04:48:18.070 --> 04:48:18.080 align:start position:0%
challenging with this legislation
 
04:48:20.150 --> 04:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
Congress has seeded its constitutional
 
04:48:22.470 --> 04:48:22.480 align:start position:0%
authority over War declarations to the
 
04:48:24.270 --> 04:48:24.280 align:start position:0%
executive branch without a
 
04:48:27.430 --> 04:48:27.440 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment to do so as
 
04:48:29.310 --> 04:48:29.320 align:start position:0%
such the president has been granted
 
04:48:31.750 --> 04:48:31.760 align:start position:0%
Powers our Founders warned against when
 
04:48:33.750 --> 04:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
they specifically vested the power to
 
04:48:36.948 --> 04:48:36.958 align:start position:0%
declare war with Congress the fiscal
 
04:48:38.708 --> 04:48:38.718 align:start position:0%
note correctly points out that we have
 
04:48:41.830 --> 04:48:41.840 align:start position:0%
not formally declared war since 19
 
04:48:45.070 --> 04:48:45.080 align:start position:0%
41 opponents will say we need the
 
04:48:46.390 --> 04:48:46.400 align:start position:0%
freedom to act
 
04:48:49.670 --> 04:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
quickly we as New Hampshire have no say
 
04:48:51.708 --> 04:48:51.718 align:start position:0%
in what the president can do with active
 
04:48:54.150 --> 04:48:54.160 align:start position:0%
duty military forces who will be the
 
04:48:57.150 --> 04:48:57.160 align:start position:0%
first to fight we are simply interceding
 
04:48:59.628 --> 04:48:59.638 align:start position:0%
between the president and our Guardsmen
 
04:49:01.670 --> 04:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
requiring him to first go to Congress
 
04:49:03.830 --> 04:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
for a formal declaration of war before
 
04:49:06.230 --> 04:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
he can take our sons our daughters our
 
04:49:08.190 --> 04:49:08.200 align:start position:0%
grandchildren and our neighbors into
 
04:49:08.200 --> 04:49:09.030 align:start position:0%
grandchildren and our neighbors into
that

04:49:09.030 --> 04:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:49:11.270 --> 04:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
fight I want to add
 
04:49:14.708 --> 04:49:14.718 align:start position:0%
the specific citing of the 2001 aumf as
 
04:49:16.350 --> 04:49:16.360 align:start position:0%
justification for our military
 
04:49:18.948 --> 04:49:18.958 align:start position:0%
Misadventures is particularly
 
04:49:21.910 --> 04:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
absurd the war in Syria that we helped
 
04:49:23.868 --> 04:49:23.878 align:start position:0%
instigate and have been supporting for a
 
04:49:26.150 --> 04:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
decade has resulted in the overthrow of
 
04:49:29.350 --> 04:49:29.360 align:start position:0%
Bashar alassad an installing of Abu
 
04:49:33.270 --> 04:49:33.280 align:start position:0%
Muhammad Al jalani as deao deao leader
 
04:49:36.310 --> 04:49:36.320 align:start position:0%
this man was a member of al-Qaeda in
 
04:49:38.788 --> 04:49:38.798 align:start position:0%
Iraq the Insurgency that came to that
 
04:49:41.708 --> 04:49:41.718 align:start position:0%
country to shoot at guys like me
 
04:49:44.548 --> 04:49:44.558 align:start position:0%
he later folded into Isis then back out
 
04:49:46.910 --> 04:49:46.920 align:start position:0%
into various factions of al-Qaeda in
 
04:49:49.390 --> 04:49:49.400 align:start position:0%
Syria and until a few weeks ago had a
 
04:49:51.590 --> 04:49:51.600 align:start position:0%
$10 million Bounty from the United
 
04:49:54.150 --> 04:49:54.160 align:start position:0%
States on his head for his terrorist
 
04:49:56.510 --> 04:49:56.520 align:start position:0%
activities National Guardsmen have been
 
04:49:59.628 --> 04:49:59.638 align:start position:0%
attacked because of this conflict in
 
04:50:02.190 --> 04:50:02.200 align:start position:0%
2023 the Louisiana guard came under
 
04:50:04.948 --> 04:50:04.958 align:start position:0%
rocket attacks in northeastern Syria
 
04:50:07.788 --> 04:50:07.798 align:start position:0%
while defending oil fields and last year
 
04:50:10.868 --> 04:50:10.878 align:start position:0%
Tower 22 in Jordan right over the Border
 
04:50:12.948 --> 04:50:12.958 align:start position:0%
of Iraq and Syria came under drone
 
04:50:14.708 --> 04:50:14.718 align:start position:0%
attack that resulted in three Army
 
04:50:16.990 --> 04:50:17.000 align:start position:0%
reservists from Georgia being killed
 
04:50:20.030 --> 04:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
along with 41 National Guardsmen wounded
 
04:50:23.270 --> 04:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
from Arizona California Kentucky and New
 
04:50:25.910 --> 04:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
York and it is my understanding through
 
04:50:28.230 --> 04:50:28.240 align:start position:0%
the lance corporal underground that the
 
04:50:30.390 --> 04:50:30.400 align:start position:0%
new New Hampshire National Guard had
 
04:50:32.670 --> 04:50:32.680 align:start position:0%
returned home from that base only weeks
 
04:50:35.390 --> 04:50:35.400 align:start position:0%
prior to the attack it could have easily
 
04:50:38.350 --> 04:50:38.360 align:start position:0%
been our guys coming home in
 
04:50:40.990 --> 04:50:41.000 align:start position:0%
boxes in closing the most important
 
04:50:42.830 --> 04:50:42.840 align:start position:0%
development has occurred since we passed
 
04:50:44.788 --> 04:50:44.798 align:start position:0%
defend the guard out of the house last
 
04:50:47.110 --> 04:50:47.120 align:start position:0%
year in a bipartisan fashion the
 
04:50:49.270 --> 04:50:49.280 align:start position:0%
nomination of Pete head Heth for
 
04:50:51.788 --> 04:50:51.798 align:start position:0%
Secretary of Defense a few days after we
 
04:50:53.868 --> 04:50:53.878 align:start position:0%
took that bipartisan vote heg said on
 
04:50:56.430 --> 04:50:56.440 align:start position:0%
his Fox and Friends episode New
 
04:50:58.070 --> 04:50:58.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is simply pointing out that
 
04:50:59.548 --> 04:50:59.558 align:start position:0%
it's supposed to be Congress that
 
04:51:02.230 --> 04:51:02.240 align:start position:0%
declares war it has become an executive
 
04:51:04.750 --> 04:51:04.760 align:start position:0%
branch function and as a result unless
 
04:51:07.150 --> 04:51:07.160 align:start position:0%
Congress declare war New Hampshire
 
04:51:08.390 --> 04:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to send its troops to
 
04:51:10.788 --> 04:51:10.798 align:start position:0%
Foreign Wars to me it makes a lot of
 
04:51:14.150 --> 04:51:14.160 align:start position:0%
sense I love this idea it's my
 
04:51:16.430 --> 04:51:16.440 align:start position:0%
understanding he has in he has since
 
04:51:19.390 --> 04:51:19.400 align:start position:0%
intensified his support for this bill so
 
04:51:22.230 --> 04:51:22.240 align:start position:0%
the funding fears and are more unfounded
 
04:51:23.910 --> 04:51:23.920 align:start position:0%
than ever when he is the guy that's
 
04:51:25.350 --> 04:51:25.360 align:start position:0%
going to be in charge of the Department
 
04:51:29.470 --> 04:51:29.480 align:start position:0%
of Defense and with that I'm open to any
 
04:51:32.390 --> 04:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Mr Prime sponsor you
 
04:51:37.190 --> 04:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
just mentioned uh Congress uh declaring
 
04:51:41.030 --> 04:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
war uh so Congress uh
 
04:51:44.868 --> 04:51:44.878 align:start position:0%
passed the tonin Gulf resolution in
 
04:51:44.878 --> 04:51:46.470 align:start position:0%
passed the tonin Gulf resolution in
1964

04:51:46.470 --> 04:51:46.480 align:start position:0%
1964
 
04:51:49.708 --> 04:51:49.718 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly so do you see much
 
04:51:51.190 --> 04:51:51.200 align:start position:0%
difference between
 
04:51:53.910 --> 04:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
Congressional resolution in support of
 
04:51:56.670 --> 04:51:56.680 align:start position:0%
military action as in the tonen Gulf
 
04:51:58.190 --> 04:51:58.200 align:start position:0%
resolution or in
 
04:52:01.070 --> 04:52:01.080 align:start position:0%
1991 uh I will I will tell I will share
 
04:52:05.070 --> 04:52:05.080 align:start position:0%
1991 I was in a in a Hole uh on the
 
04:52:08.270 --> 04:52:08.280 align:start position:0%
border of Saudi Arabia and we were
 
04:52:11.708 --> 04:52:11.718 align:start position:0%
acutely aware that back here in America
 
04:52:15.030 --> 04:52:15.040 align:start position:0%
there was going to be a vote um as to
 
04:52:16.390 --> 04:52:16.400 align:start position:0%
whether or not to authorize President
 
04:52:19.510 --> 04:52:19.520 align:start position:0%
Bush to use Force I heard later that he
 
04:52:22.070 --> 04:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
said he was going to use Force either
 
04:52:25.830 --> 04:52:25.840 align:start position:0%
way uh of course as it turned out he the
 
04:52:29.470 --> 04:52:29.480 align:start position:0%
Senate uh vote the aumf they they passed
 
04:52:31.830 --> 04:52:31.840 align:start position:0%
both houses right so my point and again
 
04:52:34.270 --> 04:52:34.280 align:start position:0%
you mentioned 2001 so my you're you're
 
04:52:36.670 --> 04:52:36.680 align:start position:0%
looking for Congressional sanction of
 
04:52:39.350 --> 04:52:39.360 align:start position:0%
military force is how much of a
 
04:52:41.310 --> 04:52:41.320 align:start position:0%
difference is there between declaration
 
04:52:44.510 --> 04:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
of war last one was in 1942 against
 
04:52:48.750 --> 04:52:48.760 align:start position:0%
Bulgaria of all people um so declaration
 
04:52:51.750 --> 04:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
of war by Congress or authorization of
 
04:52:54.270 --> 04:52:54.280 align:start position:0%
force by Congress is there a distinction
 
04:52:56.190 --> 04:52:56.200 align:start position:0%
or a difference no I believe that there
 
04:52:58.030 --> 04:52:58.040 align:start position:0%
is a very big distinction here with the
 
04:52:59.868 --> 04:52:59.878 align:start position:0%
authorization for used to military force
 
04:53:01.628 --> 04:53:01.638 align:start position:0%
what we're currently operating under is
 
04:53:03.830 --> 04:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
it allows the uh president to decide the
 
04:53:06.310 --> 04:53:06.320 align:start position:0%
start point the Endo the targets uh in
 
04:53:08.708 --> 04:53:08.718 align:start position:0%
the case of the 2001 aumf we've engaged
 
04:53:10.548 --> 04:53:10.558 align:start position:0%
in military activities in over 20
 
04:53:12.470 --> 04:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
something countries uh and we're using
 
04:53:14.070 --> 04:53:14.080 align:start position:0%
it even in in these cases where it's
 
04:53:16.350 --> 04:53:16.360 align:start position:0%
we're literally in in Syria we're
 
04:53:18.190 --> 04:53:18.200 align:start position:0%
fighting on the side of al-Qaeda who is
 
04:53:21.150 --> 04:53:21.160 align:start position:0%
the target of the 2001 aumf we have
 
04:53:24.110 --> 04:53:24.120 align:start position:0%
never passed an aumf to authorize
 
04:53:26.470 --> 04:53:26.480 align:start position:0%
anything we've done in the Syrian
 
04:53:29.070 --> 04:53:29.080 align:start position:0%
conflict and because of the broad
 
04:53:31.030 --> 04:53:31.040 align:start position:0%
language of 2001 they just keep looking
 
04:53:33.990 --> 04:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
at it like yeah sure that covers it and
 
04:53:35.708 --> 04:53:35.718 align:start position:0%
every and this has been on the books and
 
04:53:37.310 --> 04:53:37.320 align:start position:0%
has been tried to be repealed by one
 
04:53:38.948 --> 04:53:38.958 align:start position:0%
chamber or the other but it never makes
 
04:53:41.270 --> 04:53:41.280 align:start position:0%
it across the Finish Line the 20 01 and
 
04:53:44.230 --> 04:53:44.240 align:start position:0%
2002 aums are still in effect in effect
 
04:53:47.548 --> 04:53:47.558 align:start position:0%
to this day we're we're at what 10 years
 
04:53:49.910 --> 04:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
since bin Laden died and we're still out
 
04:53:52.788 --> 04:53:52.798 align:start position:0%
the 2001 aumf and we're helping al-Qaeda
 
04:53:54.150 --> 04:53:54.160 align:start position:0%
in some of these countries and it's not
 
04:53:56.190 --> 04:53:56.200 align:start position:0%
limited to Syria we helped al-Qaeda in
 
04:53:58.070 --> 04:53:58.080 align:start position:0%
libia we're helping Al-Qaeda and Yemen
 
04:54:00.270 --> 04:54:00.280 align:start position:0%
against the houthis like we decide who
 
04:54:02.948 --> 04:54:02.958 align:start position:0%
our enemies are at you know the whim of
 
04:54:05.190 --> 04:54:05.200 align:start position:0%
the day it's
 
04:54:07.750 --> 04:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
ridiculous to be clear if there was a
 
04:54:09.230 --> 04:54:09.240 align:start position:0%
declaration of war you would have no
 
04:54:11.310 --> 04:54:11.320 align:start position:0%
issue with the National Guard
 
04:54:12.510 --> 04:54:12.520 align:start position:0%
okay we just want them to follow the
 
04:54:13.788 --> 04:54:13.798 align:start position:0%
Constitutional process because then we
 
04:54:15.548 --> 04:54:15.558 align:start position:0%
can hold our legislators accountable and
 
04:54:20.110 --> 04:54:20.120 align:start position:0%
we can vote them out qu questions other
 
04:54:26.390 --> 04:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:29.150 --> 04:54:29.160 align:start position:0%
cyber oh sorry sorry about
 
04:54:32.670 --> 04:54:32.680 align:start position:0%
that um okay so while I agree with the
 
04:54:37.548 --> 04:54:37.558 align:start position:0%
messaging this is aiming towards um I do
 
04:54:40.670 --> 04:54:40.680 align:start position:0%
have to say that well you just me I
 
04:54:43.628 --> 04:54:43.638 align:start position:0%
believe it was Pete head is the name
 
04:54:44.830 --> 04:54:44.840 align:start position:0%
yeah I hadn't heard about that
 
04:54:47.990 --> 04:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
appointment yet but um so if he's in
 
04:54:50.590 --> 04:54:50.600 align:start position:0%
favor of this why would we not do this
 
04:54:51.830 --> 04:54:51.840 align:start position:0%
as a
 
04:54:53.990 --> 04:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
resolution and especially being the
 
04:54:57.230 --> 04:54:57.240 align:start position:0%
sponsor of this bill try not to get this
 
04:55:00.230 --> 04:55:00.240 align:start position:0%
done on the national scale so that it
 
04:55:02.350 --> 04:55:02.360 align:start position:0%
goes into effect for everybody and you
 
04:55:05.110 --> 04:55:05.120 align:start position:0%
know work with our delegation on that so
 
04:55:06.628 --> 04:55:06.638 align:start position:0%
I love the question uh so the one thing
 
04:55:07.948 --> 04:55:07.958 align:start position:0%
I would say is heg Seth won't be
 
04:55:10.070 --> 04:55:10.080 align:start position:0%
Secretary of Defense forever we need to
 
04:55:11.590 --> 04:55:11.600 align:start position:0%
make sure that we put these guide uh
 
04:55:14.708 --> 04:55:14.718 align:start position:0%
guard rails in place now and once we
 
04:55:17.310 --> 04:55:17.320 align:start position:0%
break the dam there are dozens of States
 
04:55:19.430 --> 04:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
lined up with similar legislation that
 
04:55:21.270 --> 04:55:21.280 align:start position:0%
are just waiting for the first person to
 
04:55:23.788 --> 04:55:23.798 align:start position:0%
go I would love New Hampshire to be the
 
04:55:26.030 --> 04:55:26.040 align:start position:0%
first state to pass this it is passed
 
04:55:27.510 --> 04:55:27.520 align:start position:0%
out of uh the upper chamber and two
 
04:55:29.310 --> 04:55:29.320 align:start position:0%
other states and we pass it out of the
 
04:55:31.070 --> 04:55:31.080 align:start position:0%
lower chamber here it's looking like
 
04:55:32.990 --> 04:55:33.000 align:start position:0%
it's probably going to pass the same uh
 
04:55:34.868 --> 04:55:34.878 align:start position:0%
Chambers as before I would love to do it
 
04:55:36.670 --> 04:55:36.680 align:start position:0%
again as far as the discussion about a
 
04:55:38.990 --> 04:55:39.000 align:start position:0%
house resolution to either ending repeal
 
04:55:42.270 --> 04:55:42.280 align:start position:0%
the War Powers Act or more specifically
 
04:55:43.868 --> 04:55:43.878 align:start position:0%
the asking for repeal of the War Powers
 
04:55:46.830 --> 04:55:46.840 align:start position:0%
Act is a big ask a smaller ask is uh the
 
04:55:49.990 --> 04:55:50.000 align:start position:0%
20012 2002 aumf repeals as I mentioned a
 
04:55:52.750 --> 04:55:52.760 align:start position:0%
little bit ago they have tried for the
 
04:55:54.990 --> 04:55:55.000 align:start position:0%
last 20 years to try to repeal these a
 
04:55:57.910 --> 04:55:57.920 align:start position:0%
umfs it goes nowhere begging the federal
 
04:56:00.030 --> 04:56:00.040 align:start position:0%
government to fix this is why the defend
 
04:56:01.548 --> 04:56:01.558 align:start position:0%
the guard act came about in the first
 
04:56:03.830 --> 04:56:03.840 align:start position:0%
place because they kept the guys behind
 
04:56:06.590 --> 04:56:06.600 align:start position:0%
it the veterans behind this have been
 
04:56:08.350 --> 04:56:08.360 align:start position:0%
smashing their face against the walls of
 
04:56:10.788 --> 04:56:10.798 align:start position:0%
Congress asking them to repeal these a F
 
04:56:12.910 --> 04:56:12.920 align:start position:0%
and they have done nothing this it is
 
04:56:14.310 --> 04:56:14.320 align:start position:0%
now time for the states to act in
 
04:56:15.708 --> 04:56:15.718 align:start position:0%
whatever way we can to stop these
 
04:56:15.718 --> 04:56:18.190 align:start position:0%
whatever way we can to stop these
forever

04:56:18.190 --> 04:56:18.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:22.150 --> 04:56:22.160 align:start position:0%
Wars follow up yeah um so just to that
 
04:56:24.470 --> 04:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
tune I mean I think it's worth a shot
 
04:56:26.350 --> 04:56:26.360 align:start position:0%
though because right now you know
 
04:56:28.510 --> 04:56:28.520 align:start position:0%
political climates definitely change
 
04:56:30.990 --> 04:56:31.000 align:start position:0%
from time to time and right now it might
 
04:56:33.190 --> 04:56:33.200 align:start position:0%
be a time when we have that chance to do
 
04:56:35.788 --> 04:56:35.798 align:start position:0%
that I would be more than happy to file
 
04:56:37.708 --> 04:56:37.718 align:start position:0%
a house resolution next term if you
 
04:56:39.230 --> 04:56:39.240 align:start position:0%
would be my co-sponsor I would love this
 
04:56:41.310 --> 04:56:41.320 align:start position:0%
for a b bipartisan house resolution to
 
04:56:44.150 --> 04:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
and repeal the 20012 2002 a umfs I would
 
04:56:45.990 --> 04:56:46.000 align:start position:0%
be happy to do that thank you thank
 
04:56:50.548 --> 04:56:50.558 align:start position:0%

04:56:52.350 --> 04:56:52.360 align:start position:0%

researchers OLS office of legislative
 
04:57:03.990 --> 04:57:04.000 align:start position:0%
services will look into the projected
 
04:57:06.110 --> 04:57:06.120 align:start position:0%
cost of the measures that we put in if
 
04:57:08.628 --> 04:57:08.638 align:start position:0%
there if there is a if there is one the
 
04:57:10.708 --> 04:57:10.718 align:start position:0%
FN the fiscal note for this measure is
 
04:57:10.718 --> 04:57:12.230 align:start position:0%

$55

04:57:12.230 --> 04:57:12.240 align:start position:0%

04:57:14.510 --> 04:57:14.520 align:start position:0%
million that's one of the that's one of
 
04:57:16.788 --> 04:57:16.798 align:start position:0%
the bigger fiscal notes I've ever seen
 
04:57:19.868 --> 04:57:19.878 align:start position:0%
can can you speak to to the significance
 
04:57:23.110 --> 04:57:23.120 align:start position:0%
of the sure that would that cost us $55
 
04:57:26.150 --> 04:57:26.160 align:start position:0%
million I I have held true since the
 
04:57:27.590 --> 04:57:27.600 align:start position:0%
very first time I've ever testified on
 
04:57:29.548 --> 04:57:29.558 align:start position:0%
this bill that that is a uh something to
 
04:57:31.510 --> 04:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
scare us into compliance with the
 
04:57:33.230 --> 04:57:33.240 align:start position:0%
military-industrial complex they want us
 
04:57:35.070 --> 04:57:35.080 align:start position:0%
to be scared they don't want us to pass
 
04:57:36.270 --> 04:57:36.280 align:start position:0%
this they don't want the states to
 
04:57:37.708 --> 04:57:37.718 align:start position:0%
assert their rights over their National
 
04:57:39.628 --> 04:57:39.638 align:start position:0%
Guard and to bring challenges to the
 
04:57:40.990 --> 04:57:41.000 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court that would disrupt the
 
04:57:42.948 --> 04:57:42.958 align:start position:0%
status quo uh I believe with the
 
04:57:45.430 --> 04:57:45.440 align:start position:0%
incoming SE def who supports this bill
 
04:57:46.990 --> 04:57:47.000 align:start position:0%
and multiple congressmen that have set
 
04:57:49.830 --> 04:57:49.840 align:start position:0%
on record in specific reference to this
 
04:57:54.750 --> 04:57:54.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:58.990 --> 04:57:59.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:03.150 --> 04:58:03.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:06.350 --> 04:58:06.360 align:start position:0%
Hemingway thank you Mr chairman
 
04:58:09.430 --> 04:58:09.440 align:start position:0%
representative so talking on the fiscal
 
04:58:11.990 --> 04:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
part of this I know that having spent
 
04:58:13.548 --> 04:58:13.558 align:start position:0%
many years in the New Hampshire National
 
04:58:16.350 --> 04:58:16.360 align:start position:0%
Guard that my first years in there we
 
04:58:19.070 --> 04:58:19.080 align:start position:0%
were always worried about whether we had
 
04:58:21.590 --> 04:58:21.600 align:start position:0%
the fuel or the equipment to do
 
04:58:24.830 --> 04:58:24.840 align:start position:0%
trading over the last several years 10
 
04:58:27.948 --> 04:58:27.958 align:start position:0%
20 15 years the the money that we've
 
04:58:30.350 --> 04:58:30.360 align:start position:0%
been getting from the federal has been
 
04:58:33.310 --> 04:58:33.320 align:start position:0%
helped to get us the best equipment that
 
04:58:36.990 --> 04:58:37.000 align:start position:0%
we can be using plus the facilities and
 
04:58:39.110 --> 04:58:39.120 align:start position:0%
the proper equipment to keep our our
 
04:58:40.628 --> 04:58:40.638 align:start position:0%
troops safe
 
04:58:42.270 --> 04:58:42.280 align:start position:0%
you do not feel that this bill would
 
04:58:45.430 --> 04:58:45.440 align:start position:0%
change that I do not believe so no I I
 
04:58:46.868 --> 04:58:46.878 align:start position:0%
I've heard from multiple congressmen
 
04:58:49.948 --> 04:58:49.958 align:start position:0%
with spe specific reference to this bill
 
04:58:51.350 --> 04:58:51.360 align:start position:0%
and with the incoming Secretary of
 
04:58:53.310 --> 04:58:53.320 align:start position:0%
Defense I don't I do not see that the
 
04:58:57.628 --> 04:58:57.638 align:start position:0%
fiscal note it holds any water follow up
 
04:59:01.628 --> 04:59:01.638 align:start position:0%
followup so on the back back of the uh
 
04:59:04.350 --> 04:59:04.360 align:start position:0%
this here it says the money that comes
 
04:59:05.830 --> 04:59:05.840 align:start position:0%
up to almost $400
 
04:59:09.110 --> 04:59:09.120 align:start position:0%
million that could possibly be withheld
 
04:59:11.750 --> 04:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
if so do desired you still don't feel
 
04:59:17.070 --> 04:59:17.080 align:start position:0%
that no okay thank you thank you other
 
04:59:19.430 --> 04:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
questions say on thank you Mr Prime
 
04:59:22.350 --> 04:59:22.360 align:start position:0%
sponsor representative okay I will tell
 
04:59:24.750 --> 04:59:24.760 align:start position:0%
you that we have a custom tradition of
 
04:59:27.868 --> 04:59:27.878 align:start position:0%
sorts here in this body when we have
 
04:59:30.110 --> 04:59:30.120 align:start position:0%
hearings we try to recognize or
 
04:59:33.230 --> 04:59:33.240 align:start position:0%
acknowledge Uh current serving reps or
 
04:59:36.270 --> 04:59:36.280 align:start position:0%
uh former reps and um try to give them a
 
04:59:39.070 --> 04:59:39.080 align:start position:0%
bit of difference uh so I'll try to do
 
04:59:41.590 --> 04:59:41.600 align:start position:0%
that maintaining with our custom uh if
 
04:59:44.510 --> 04:59:44.520 align:start position:0%
the occasionally there'll be a newer rep
 
04:59:48.150 --> 04:59:48.160 align:start position:0%
uh legislator um who will put a card in
 
04:59:50.708 --> 04:59:50.718 align:start position:0%
and I we won't know that they are a rep
 
04:59:52.990 --> 04:59:53.000 align:start position:0%
so I apologize in advance if there are
 
04:59:57.030 --> 04:59:57.040 align:start position:0%
any uh serving legislators who uh I
 
05:00:00.910 --> 05:00:00.920 align:start position:0%
don't recognize uh I recognize three and
 
05:00:03.070 --> 05:00:03.080 align:start position:0%
uh we will go to them now we have about
 
05:00:06.470 --> 05:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
12 cards and this is the the only other
 
05:00:07.708 --> 05:00:07.718 align:start position:0%
Bill we're going to hear today so we'll
 
05:00:09.990 --> 05:00:10.000 align:start position:0%
be here as long as it takes I don't want
 
05:00:11.628 --> 05:00:11.638 align:start position:0%
to I don't see a need to put any limit
 
05:00:15.230 --> 05:00:15.240 align:start position:0%
on testim time of testimony uh I just
 
05:00:17.230 --> 05:00:17.240 align:start position:0%
simply would say if if a significant
 
05:00:20.390 --> 05:00:20.400 align:start position:0%
Point has been made uh and developed uh
 
05:00:22.708 --> 05:00:22.718 align:start position:0%
that you be careful about taking time to
 
05:00:24.230 --> 05:00:24.240 align:start position:0%
say something or develop something
 
05:00:27.430 --> 05:00:27.440 align:start position:0%
that's already been been developed okay
 
05:00:29.948 --> 05:00:29.958 align:start position:0%
uh that said representative uh Henry
 
05:00:34.830 --> 05:00:34.840 align:start position:0%
Jason III from gtown uh is in the house
 
05:00:37.230 --> 05:00:37.240 align:start position:0%
uh welcome to state federal and Veterans
 
05:00:45.750 --> 05:00:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:48.070 --> 05:00:48.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
05:00:50.868 --> 05:00:50.878 align:start position:0%
chair so some of you may or may not know
 
05:00:53.350 --> 05:00:53.360 align:start position:0%
I did 24 years in the Army myself I
 
05:00:54.948 --> 05:00:54.958 align:start position:0%
retired from operations in the
 
05:00:56.470 --> 05:00:56.480 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts National Guard I worked as
 
05:00:59.270 --> 05:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
an operation Sergeant so I have seen
 
05:01:02.230 --> 05:01:02.240 align:start position:0%
some of the effects of what happens when
 
05:01:03.830 --> 05:01:03.840 align:start position:0%
the National Guard is not available and
 
05:01:05.750 --> 05:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
ready when the when the federal
 
05:01:07.510 --> 05:01:07.520 align:start position:0%
government calls and I just want to
 
05:01:09.948 --> 05:01:09.958 align:start position:0%
speak to those things from that position
 
05:01:11.390 --> 05:01:11.400 align:start position:0%
as a subject matter expert who worked in
 
05:01:13.548 --> 05:01:13.558 align:start position:0%
the field again the last 15 years of my
 
05:01:15.548 --> 05:01:15.558 align:start position:0%
career were in Human Resources
 
05:01:18.070 --> 05:01:18.080 align:start position:0%
recruiting retention and in
 
05:01:21.150 --> 05:01:21.160 align:start position:0%
operations um so once every quarter each
 
05:01:22.628 --> 05:01:22.638 align:start position:0%
of your National Guard units has to
 
05:01:24.868 --> 05:01:24.878 align:start position:0%
submit a report on their Readiness that
 
05:01:27.670 --> 05:01:27.680 align:start position:0%
report encompasses equipment maintenance
 
05:01:30.230 --> 05:01:30.240 align:start position:0%
Personnel Personnel health issues if
 
05:01:31.590 --> 05:01:31.600 align:start position:0%
somebody's non- Deployable because of an
 
05:01:33.510 --> 05:01:33.520 align:start position:0%
injury or pre or pregnancy or something
 
05:01:34.830 --> 05:01:34.840 align:start position:0%
if somebody's still in the training
 
05:01:36.470 --> 05:01:36.480 align:start position:0%
cycle if somebody doesn't have the
 
05:01:38.270 --> 05:01:38.280 align:start position:0%
schools that they need to do their job
 
05:01:41.230 --> 05:01:41.240 align:start position:0%
those are all reported funding for the
 
05:01:43.230 --> 05:01:43.240 align:start position:0%
State National Guard 80% comes from the
 
05:01:45.150 --> 05:01:45.160 align:start position:0%
federal government and almost all the
 
05:01:47.070 --> 05:01:47.080 align:start position:0%
equipment belongs to federal government
 
05:01:48.470 --> 05:01:48.480 align:start position:0%
so the things that I'll touch on real
 
05:01:50.708 --> 05:01:50.718 align:start position:0%
quick are equipment maintenance and
 
05:01:52.150 --> 05:01:52.160 align:start position:0%
Personnel Readiness and those are going
 
05:01:54.310 --> 05:01:54.320 align:start position:0%
to be used as the excuses to make the uh
 
05:01:55.910 --> 05:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
the cross- leveling transfers look like
 
05:01:57.510 --> 05:01:57.520 align:start position:0%
it's non-punitive
 
05:02:00.510 --> 05:02:00.520 align:start position:0%
we fly these helicopters on training
 
05:02:02.590 --> 05:02:02.600 align:start position:0%
missions we put in for maintenance
 
05:02:05.070 --> 05:02:05.080 align:start position:0%
requests if Parts get allocated to other
 
05:02:07.070 --> 05:02:07.080 align:start position:0%
states because their states are on the
 
05:02:09.270 --> 05:02:09.280 align:start position:0%
deployability Matrix we're not able to
 
05:02:11.430 --> 05:02:11.440 align:start position:0%
keep those hel Ops in the air we have to
 
05:02:13.390 --> 05:02:13.400 align:start position:0%
report that as a maintenance deficiency
 
05:02:14.548 --> 05:02:14.558 align:start position:0%
we report that as a maintenance
 
05:02:16.350 --> 05:02:16.360 align:start position:0%
deficiency too many times those
 
05:02:17.830 --> 05:02:17.840 align:start position:0%
helicopters are going to another
 
05:02:19.788 --> 05:02:19.798 align:start position:0%
National Guard along with the pilot
 
05:02:21.708 --> 05:02:21.718 align:start position:0%
allocations if we can't get our pilots
 
05:02:23.150 --> 05:02:23.160 align:start position:0%
in the air often enough they lose their
 
05:02:23.160 --> 05:02:24.190 align:start position:0%
in the air often enough they lose their
flight

05:02:24.190 --> 05:02:24.200 align:start position:0%
flight
 
05:02:26.590 --> 05:02:26.600 align:start position:0%
credentials um that same thing is going
 
05:02:28.190 --> 05:02:28.200 align:start position:0%
to be true of our trucks now in a
 
05:02:29.750 --> 05:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
domestic state of emergency if we need
 
05:02:31.310 --> 05:02:31.320 align:start position:0%
to respond to a flood in the state of
 
05:02:32.548 --> 05:02:32.558 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and get people off of
 
05:02:34.150 --> 05:02:34.160 align:start position:0%
rooftops or out of a place we need big
 
05:02:36.628 --> 05:02:36.638 align:start position:0%
trucks and we need helicopters those are
 
05:02:38.270 --> 05:02:38.280 align:start position:0%
the first two resources we're likely to
 
05:02:41.150 --> 05:02:41.160 align:start position:0%
see problems with in terms of personnel
 
05:02:42.510 --> 05:02:42.520 align:start position:0%
we're talking about careers and we're
 
05:02:44.430 --> 05:02:44.440 align:start position:0%
talking about real people it's important
 
05:02:46.470 --> 05:02:46.480 align:start position:0%
to understand that through NGB the
 
05:02:48.070 --> 05:02:48.080 align:start position:0%
Department of Defense owns these
 
05:02:50.190 --> 05:02:50.200 align:start position:0%
training seats National Guard members
 
05:02:51.350 --> 05:02:51.360 align:start position:0%
don't have anything on their uniform
 
05:02:52.788 --> 05:02:52.798 align:start position:0%
that says National Guard they go to Army
 
05:02:55.310 --> 05:02:55.320 align:start position:0%
basic training they go to uh Air Force
 
05:02:56.548 --> 05:02:56.558 align:start position:0%
basic training for the air guard side of
 
05:02:58.350 --> 05:02:58.360 align:start position:0%
the house I apologize to my air guard
 
05:03:00.030 --> 05:03:00.040 align:start position:0%
companions I was in the Army so I
 
05:03:02.350 --> 05:03:02.360 align:start position:0%
usually refer soldiers no disrespect to
 
05:03:05.430 --> 05:03:05.440 align:start position:0%
the other side of there um but all your
 
05:03:06.830 --> 05:03:06.840 align:start position:0%
training schools all your promotion
 
05:03:09.030 --> 05:03:09.040 align:start position:0%
schools those are all DOD schools those
 
05:03:10.750 --> 05:03:10.760 align:start position:0%
are all run by the Department of Defense
 
05:03:13.470 --> 05:03:13.480 align:start position:0%
they are army schools some are run
 
05:03:15.590 --> 05:03:15.600 align:start position:0%
through National Guard training acmy but
 
05:03:16.990 --> 05:03:17.000 align:start position:0%
those are open to the Army Reserves and
 
05:03:18.270 --> 05:03:18.280 align:start position:0%
the regular army or the Air Force
 
05:03:19.830 --> 05:03:19.840 align:start position:0%
Reserves in the regular Air Force
 
05:03:23.910 --> 05:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
accordingly so if we are looking at
 
05:03:26.310 --> 05:03:26.320 align:start position:0%
these people as real careers and the
 
05:03:28.708 --> 05:03:28.718 align:start position:0%
military starts to ration the training
 
05:03:32.470 --> 05:03:32.480 align:start position:0%
seats to favor Deployable metric States
 
05:03:34.510 --> 05:03:34.520 align:start position:0%
we're talking about stagnating people's
 
05:03:37.750 --> 05:03:37.760 align:start position:0%
careers um so bringing that all together
 
05:03:40.270 --> 05:03:40.280 align:start position:0%
if we are not able to out of our own
 
05:03:42.868 --> 05:03:42.878 align:start position:0%
Pockets maintain the equipment and find
 
05:03:44.750 --> 05:03:44.760 align:start position:0%
a way to get our our service members
 
05:03:46.390 --> 05:03:46.400 align:start position:0%
into training we're going to lose
 
05:03:47.990 --> 05:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
Readiness and if the federal government
 
05:03:48.948 --> 05:03:48.958 align:start position:0%
decides that they're going to start
 
05:03:50.510 --> 05:03:50.520 align:start position:0%
moving these resources because they've
 
05:03:51.788 --> 05:03:51.798 align:start position:0%
shot Us in the foot in terms of
 
05:03:53.708 --> 05:03:53.718 align:start position:0%
Readiness then we need to find an
 
05:03:55.990 --> 05:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
alternate way to make sure that we have
 
05:03:58.548 --> 05:03:58.558 align:start position:0%
our own resource within the
 
05:04:01.110 --> 05:04:01.120 align:start position:0%
state so uh pending any question my
 
05:04:03.350 --> 05:04:03.360 align:start position:0%
biggest concern honestly is that a
 
05:04:05.548 --> 05:04:05.558 align:start position:0%
downsizing of the State National Guard
 
05:04:07.548 --> 05:04:07.558 align:start position:0%
would cause us to not be able to respond
 
05:04:09.430 --> 05:04:09.440 align:start position:0%
in a domestic state of emergency in the
 
05:04:10.510 --> 05:04:10.520 align:start position:0%
state of of New
 
05:04:13.628 --> 05:04:13.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so pending any
 
05:04:18.390 --> 05:04:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:21.830 --> 05:04:21.840 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
05:04:24.470 --> 05:04:24.480 align:start position:0%
Jones Thank you Mr chair and and thank
 
05:04:27.628 --> 05:04:27.638 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony um the last
 
05:04:30.190 --> 05:04:30.200 align:start position:0%
sentence you said could you repeat that
 
05:04:33.110 --> 05:04:33.120 align:start position:0%
again I said my concern would be if we
 
05:04:35.110 --> 05:04:35.120 align:start position:0%
lose for structure and equipment in the
 
05:04:36.868 --> 05:04:36.878 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire that in a
 
05:04:38.868 --> 05:04:38.878 align:start position:0%
domestic state of emergency we would not
 
05:04:41.750 --> 05:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
have the resources to be our own rescue
 
05:04:43.788 --> 05:04:43.798 align:start position:0%
uh to to expand on that that would put
 
05:04:45.190 --> 05:04:45.200 align:start position:0%
us completely at the mercy of the
 
05:04:46.708 --> 05:04:46.718 align:start position:0%
resources of neighboring states or of
 
05:04:48.910 --> 05:04:48.920 align:start position:0%
FEMA if we overwhelmed our own emergency
 
05:04:51.070 --> 05:04:51.080 align:start position:0%
response within the state and do you
 
05:04:51.080 --> 05:04:52.788 align:start position:0%
response within the state and do you
think

05:04:52.788 --> 05:04:52.798 align:start position:0%
think
 
05:04:55.910 --> 05:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
it's changed by deployed to active duty
 
05:04:57.190 --> 05:04:57.200 align:start position:0%
in foreign
 
05:04:57.200 --> 05:04:58.750 align:start position:0%
in foreign
States

05:04:58.750 --> 05:04:58.760 align:start position:0%
States
 
05:05:00.750 --> 05:05:00.760 align:start position:0%
um they are only is that going to have
 
05:05:02.750 --> 05:05:02.760 align:start position:0%
an effect on it it can have an effect on
 
05:05:04.310 --> 05:05:04.320 align:start position:0%
it um they're not allowed to deploy the
 
05:05:05.708 --> 05:05:05.718 align:start position:0%
majority of the National Guard at the
 
05:05:07.948 --> 05:05:07.958 align:start position:0%
same time there's I I believe the last
 
05:05:09.750 --> 05:05:09.760 align:start position:0%
time I checked it was a two3 matrix
 
05:05:11.390 --> 05:05:11.400 align:start position:0%
where two-thirds of the National Guard
 
05:05:12.510 --> 05:05:12.520 align:start position:0%
had to stay in the state and the
 
05:05:15.030 --> 05:05:15.040 align:start position:0%
governor also had the opportunity to
 
05:05:17.788 --> 05:05:17.798 align:start position:0%
either say no or defer um deployments
 
05:05:19.670 --> 05:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
based on the state's Readiness cycle and
 
05:05:21.430 --> 05:05:21.440 align:start position:0%
the state's available assets that's
 
05:05:23.390 --> 05:05:23.400 align:start position:0%
informative thank
 
05:05:26.150 --> 05:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
you so representative what I'm hearing
 
05:05:28.990 --> 05:05:29.000 align:start position:0%
and correct me if I'm not correct in
 
05:05:32.390 --> 05:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
what I'm paraphrasing your testimony
 
05:05:36.030 --> 05:05:36.040 align:start position:0%
stating you're saying that this measure
 
05:05:39.030 --> 05:05:39.040 align:start position:0%
could conceivably degrade the guard
 
05:05:41.150 --> 05:05:41.160 align:start position:0%
which would threaten the ability of the
 
05:05:43.190 --> 05:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire National Guard to conduct
 
05:05:46.830 --> 05:05:46.840 align:start position:0%
local missions is that is that that is
 
05:05:52.470 --> 05:05:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:56.868 --> 05:05:56.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:07.708 --> 05:06:07.718 align:start position:0%

05:06:43.390 --> 05:06:43.400 align:start position:0%
somebody who teaches Civics uh I am
 
05:06:45.350 --> 05:06:45.360 align:start position:0%
deeply concerned by the United States
 
05:06:48.510 --> 05:06:48.520 align:start position:0%
and its turn over the last 82 years
 
05:06:51.548 --> 05:06:51.558 align:start position:0%
since 1942 as you mentioned in Bulgaria
 
05:06:55.948 --> 05:06:55.958 align:start position:0%
when we declared war and congress's lack
 
05:06:59.190 --> 05:06:59.200 align:start position:0%
of Courage around the issue of genuinely
 
05:07:01.510 --> 05:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
debating any of the number of conflicts
 
05:07:02.990 --> 05:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
that we've gone through over those last
 
05:07:05.868 --> 05:07:05.878 align:start position:0%
82 years you asked a good question and
 
05:07:07.230 --> 05:07:07.240 align:start position:0%
before I get into some of my other
 
05:07:08.788 --> 05:07:08.798 align:start position:0%
testimony I would like to address it
 
05:07:10.948 --> 05:07:10.958 align:start position:0%
about the elf of tonen resolution and
 
05:07:14.470 --> 05:07:14.480 align:start position:0%
the War Powers Act that came after that
 
05:07:16.788 --> 05:07:16.798 align:start position:0%
those two pieces of legislation
 
05:07:18.868 --> 05:07:18.878 align:start position:0%
specifically the War Powers Act being
 
05:07:21.030 --> 05:07:21.040 align:start position:0%
that that's still
 
05:07:23.430 --> 05:07:23.440 align:start position:0%
used is different than the Declaration
 
05:07:26.470 --> 05:07:26.480 align:start position:0%
of guard than the declaration of war for
 
05:07:28.350 --> 05:07:28.360 align:start position:0%
the reasons that representative Manion
 
05:07:30.910 --> 05:07:30.920 align:start position:0%
brought up but it's also because that
 
05:07:32.830 --> 05:07:32.840 align:start position:0%
only requires Congressional leadership
 
05:07:35.470 --> 05:07:35.480 align:start position:0%
to know about the actions being taken by
 
05:07:37.948 --> 05:07:37.958 align:start position:0%
the executive branch and there have been
 
05:07:40.670 --> 05:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
a number of instances in which
 
05:07:43.070 --> 05:07:43.080 align:start position:0%
Congressional leadership doesn't let the
 
05:07:45.310 --> 05:07:45.320 align:start position:0%
broader members in the United States
 
05:07:48.150 --> 05:07:48.160 align:start position:0%
Congress know and and that puts us in a
 
05:07:50.470 --> 05:07:50.480 align:start position:0%
dangerous position where the leadership
 
05:07:54.390 --> 05:07:54.400 align:start position:0%
in congress has some level of
 
05:07:56.830 --> 05:07:56.840 align:start position:0%
responsibility on these conflicts that
 
05:07:58.830 --> 05:07:58.840 align:start position:0%
should be given to the broader Congress
 
05:08:00.750 --> 05:08:00.760 align:start position:0%
and to the Congress as a
 
05:08:03.030 --> 05:08:03.040 align:start position:0%
whole not to mention the fact that it
 
05:08:05.590 --> 05:08:05.600 align:start position:0%
keeps us from debating these topics in
 
05:08:08.628 --> 05:08:08.638 align:start position:0%
an open Forum in a public way for the
 
05:08:10.310 --> 05:08:10.320 align:start position:0%
people of the United states to hear on
 
05:08:12.470 --> 05:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
the house of the floor on the floor of
 
05:08:14.548 --> 05:08:14.558 align:start position:0%
the United States Senate we haven't seen
 
05:08:18.310 --> 05:08:18.320 align:start position:0%
that done in a long time um I would
 
05:08:20.948 --> 05:08:20.958 align:start position:0%
bring up the issues
 
05:08:23.590 --> 05:08:23.600 align:start position:0%
around many different veterans here in
 
05:08:26.350 --> 05:08:26.360 align:start position:0%
this legislature who support this
 
05:08:28.470 --> 05:08:28.480 align:start position:0%
legislation people on this committee who
 
05:08:30.708 --> 05:08:30.718 align:start position:0%
I know have served in our military and
 
05:08:33.350 --> 05:08:33.360 align:start position:0%
our Navy and who support this
 
05:08:35.990 --> 05:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
legislation and some new members who I
 
05:08:37.948 --> 05:08:37.958 align:start position:0%
haven't met yet freshmen who are here
 
05:08:39.670 --> 05:08:39.680 align:start position:0%
who have served our nation as well well
 
05:08:41.310 --> 05:08:41.320 align:start position:0%
and we're very thankful for their
 
05:08:43.990 --> 05:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
service and they brought up last year
 
05:08:46.030 --> 05:08:46.040 align:start position:0%
representative potuk who was the sponsor
 
05:08:48.310 --> 05:08:48.320 align:start position:0%
of this legislation last year he's a
 
05:08:50.788 --> 05:08:50.798 align:start position:0%
Vietnam veteran and in rewatching his
 
05:08:54.750 --> 05:08:54.760 align:start position:0%
testimony I was compelled by his comment
 
05:08:58.230 --> 05:08:58.240 align:start position:0%
around Vietnam was a war ask any of
 
05:09:00.548 --> 05:09:00.558 align:start position:0%
these veterans who served in Vietnam or
 
05:09:02.868 --> 05:09:02.878 align:start position:0%
Korea or any of these other conflicts
 
05:09:07.390 --> 05:09:07.400 align:start position:0%
these were Wars and for congress not to
 
05:09:10.030 --> 05:09:10.040 align:start position:0%
do its Duty as outlined in the United
 
05:09:12.868 --> 05:09:12.878 align:start position:0%
States Constitution and debate these
 
05:09:15.670 --> 05:09:15.680 align:start position:0%
issues and declare war before sending
 
05:09:20.430 --> 05:09:20.440 align:start position:0%
our 1819 20-year-old boys out to the
 
05:09:23.910 --> 05:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
Jungle I think is a moral travesty in
 
05:09:25.548 --> 05:09:25.558 align:start position:0%
the United States of America and it's
 
05:09:25.558 --> 05:09:26.670 align:start position:0%
the United States of America and it's
put

05:09:26.670 --> 05:09:26.680 align:start position:0%
put
 
05:09:29.510 --> 05:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
us from a foreign policy perspective if
 
05:09:32.150 --> 05:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
you were looking at it not from the
 
05:09:33.868 --> 05:09:33.878 align:start position:0%
defense department perspective but from
 
05:09:36.470 --> 05:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
the state Department's perspective in a
 
05:09:40.270 --> 05:09:40.280 align:start position:0%
really hard position diplomatic when
 
05:09:43.390 --> 05:09:43.400 align:start position:0%
Nations see that we are willing to
 
05:09:46.628 --> 05:09:46.638 align:start position:0%
unilaterally go after Sovereign Nations
 
05:09:50.070 --> 05:09:50.080 align:start position:0%
for no reason whatsoever such as Iraq
 
05:09:53.788 --> 05:09:53.798 align:start position:0%
based off of a lie then they get worried
 
05:09:57.670 --> 05:09:57.680 align:start position:0%
and the stability of the world is shaky
 
05:09:59.830 --> 05:09:59.840 align:start position:0%
because the United States is the most
 
05:10:01.628 --> 05:10:01.638 align:start position:0%
powerful country on the face of the
 
05:10:03.788 --> 05:10:03.798 align:start position:0%
planet not just because of our military
 
05:10:06.390 --> 05:10:06.400 align:start position:0%
our technology our people our prowess
 
05:10:10.628 --> 05:10:10.638 align:start position:0%
but because of the land that we have and
 
05:10:13.788 --> 05:10:13.798 align:start position:0%
its position on the world and uh our
 
05:10:17.750 --> 05:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
geostrategic position is just unmatched
 
05:10:19.310 --> 05:10:19.320 align:start position:0%
and when we do something the world
 
05:10:22.548 --> 05:10:22.558 align:start position:0%
listens and if we are unilaterally
 
05:10:25.350 --> 05:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
declaring Force against countries
 
05:10:27.750 --> 05:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
Sovereign Nations the world is listening
 
05:10:29.670 --> 05:10:29.680 align:start position:0%
and I think we've seen the effects of
 
05:10:31.990 --> 05:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
that over the last few years with other
 
05:10:35.590 --> 05:10:35.600 align:start position:0%
countries following suit we gave
 
05:10:37.750 --> 05:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
congress the power to declare war
 
05:10:40.030 --> 05:10:40.040 align:start position:0%
because the scholars who
 
05:10:44.628 --> 05:10:44.638 align:start position:0%
wrote our constitution 248 years ago saw
 
05:10:47.270 --> 05:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
over their history they were very well
 
05:10:50.150 --> 05:10:50.160 align:start position:0%
educated men they knew that despots
 
05:10:52.310 --> 05:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
Kings over the course of history had
 
05:10:56.868 --> 05:10:56.878 align:start position:0%
used conflicts and Wars to Rally up publ
 
05:10:59.070 --> 05:10:59.080 align:start position:0%
uh the public who if they weren't
 
05:11:01.390 --> 05:11:01.400 align:start position:0%
rallied around that conflict might might
 
05:11:03.548 --> 05:11:03.558 align:start position:0%
realize that they were being taxed to
 
05:11:07.510 --> 05:11:07.520 align:start position:0%
the brim or uh under an authoritarian
 
05:11:09.948 --> 05:11:09.958 align:start position:0%
leader as the people the United States
 
05:11:13.070 --> 05:11:13.080 align:start position:0%
of America realized 248 years ago in
 
05:11:14.868 --> 05:11:14.878 align:start position:0%
creating our
 
05:11:17.030 --> 05:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
constitution I'm most concerned that
 
05:11:19.670 --> 05:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
we've entered a period in this country
 
05:11:23.430 --> 05:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
where it's uh or Orwell's Forever War
 
05:11:27.270 --> 05:11:27.280 align:start position:0%
where as representative Manion outlined
 
05:11:29.628 --> 05:11:29.638 align:start position:0%
we just find a new enemy wherever we can
 
05:11:32.788 --> 05:11:32.798 align:start position:0%
look for one and the defense Contracting
 
05:11:36.030 --> 05:11:36.040 align:start position:0%
agencies continue to make money the
 
05:11:37.430 --> 05:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
executives I should say of those
 
05:11:40.390 --> 05:11:40.400 align:start position:0%
agencies continue to make money and the
 
05:11:42.948 --> 05:11:42.958 align:start position:0%
Congressional members who go into those
 
05:11:45.270 --> 05:11:45.280 align:start position:0%
consulting firms after they're members
 
05:11:48.270 --> 05:11:48.280 align:start position:0%
of Congress serving on the defense and
 
05:11:50.310 --> 05:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
Appropriations committees in the United
 
05:11:53.230 --> 05:11:53.240 align:start position:0%
States Congress make money and the
 
05:11:56.470 --> 05:11:56.480 align:start position:0%
generals who have sold out their they're
 
05:11:59.030 --> 05:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
boys they are men and women who are in
 
05:12:02.830 --> 05:12:02.840 align:start position:0%
their brass who go on to serve and make
 
05:12:05.390 --> 05:12:05.400 align:start position:0%
money in the defense Contracting agency
 
05:12:08.788 --> 05:12:08.798 align:start position:0%
the military brass the veterans who are
 
05:12:11.070 --> 05:12:11.080 align:start position:0%
on the around who the people who know
 
05:12:13.788 --> 05:12:13.798 align:start position:0%
what it's like to be denied service by
 
05:12:18.030 --> 05:12:18.040 align:start position:0%
the VA who are going through what the
 
05:12:19.948 --> 05:12:19.958 align:start position:0%
effects are of the United States of
 
05:12:21.590 --> 05:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
America doing these wars and then not
 
05:12:23.150 --> 05:12:23.160 align:start position:0%
paying attention or caring about the
 
05:12:25.150 --> 05:12:25.160 align:start position:0%
people who served in those Wars those
 
05:12:27.310 --> 05:12:27.320 align:start position:0%
people who are directly facing the brunt
 
05:12:29.230 --> 05:12:29.240 align:start position:0%
of of the government right now and
 
05:12:32.110 --> 05:12:32.120 align:start position:0%
knowing what it's like to be a veteran
 
05:12:33.948 --> 05:12:33.958 align:start position:0%
who served your country and to come back
 
05:12:36.190 --> 05:12:36.200 align:start position:0%
only to find that nobody nobody knows
 
05:12:38.430 --> 05:12:38.440 align:start position:0%
what you went through and isn't going to
 
05:12:41.110 --> 05:12:41.120 align:start position:0%
help you those people support this
 
05:12:43.150 --> 05:12:43.160 align:start position:0%
legislation and they they don't want the
 
05:12:45.270 --> 05:12:45.280 align:start position:0%
forever Wars they don't want Orwell's
 
05:12:46.910 --> 05:12:46.920 align:start position:0%
Forever War where we just continue to
 
05:12:51.830 --> 05:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
find a new enemy and for me uh this is
 
05:12:54.150 --> 05:12:54.160 align:start position:0%
personal legislation it's not going to
 
05:12:55.788 --> 05:12:55.798 align:start position:0%
immediately solve the United States
 
05:12:59.110 --> 05:12:59.120 align:start position:0%
congress's lack of Courage issue but it
 
05:13:01.628 --> 05:13:01.638 align:start position:0%
does for what we can do here in the New
 
05:13:01.638 --> 05:13:02.708 align:start position:0%
does for what we can do here in the New
Hampshire

05:13:02.708 --> 05:13:02.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
05:13:05.868 --> 05:13:05.878 align:start position:0%
legislature take the first step forward
 
05:13:07.948 --> 05:13:07.958 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire to say this is how we
 
05:13:09.708 --> 05:13:09.718 align:start position:0%
can get it done and to your app Point
 
05:13:11.510 --> 05:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
representative CT about a
 
05:13:13.990 --> 05:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
resolution as you know Mr chair and
 
05:13:15.470 --> 05:13:15.480 align:start position:0%
members who have served here for a long
 
05:13:17.948 --> 05:13:17.958 align:start position:0%
time house resolutions go into the
 
05:13:20.510 --> 05:13:20.520 align:start position:0%
Congressional trash bin they they they
 
05:13:22.590 --> 05:13:22.600 align:start position:0%
don't have any power they don't have any
 
05:13:24.948 --> 05:13:24.958 align:start position:0%
weight and if we want this legislation
 
05:13:27.590 --> 05:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
to have power and weight in our
 
05:13:29.830 --> 05:13:29.840 align:start position:0%
Congressional Delegation seeing that the
 
05:13:31.590 --> 05:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire is genuinely
 
05:13:33.110 --> 05:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
looking at the fact that they haven't
 
05:13:35.270 --> 05:13:35.280 align:start position:0%
declared war debated these issues for 82
 
05:13:37.390 --> 05:13:37.400 align:start position:0%
years then we should pass this
 
05:13:39.708 --> 05:13:39.718 align:start position:0%
legislation and one of the last points I
 
05:13:42.430 --> 05:13:42.440 align:start position:0%
would make about the fiscal note for the
 
05:13:44.948 --> 05:13:44.958 align:start position:0%
freshmen in the room and others who have
 
05:13:48.510 --> 05:13:48.520 align:start position:0%
served not as long is the fiscal note is
 
05:13:53.548 --> 05:13:53.558 align:start position:0%
not uh sacran it is not um sometimes
 
05:13:55.390 --> 05:13:55.400 align:start position:0%
agencies and organizations when they are
 
05:13:57.310 --> 05:13:57.320 align:start position:0%
against a particular piece of
 
05:14:00.548 --> 05:14:00.558 align:start position:0%
legislation will exaggerate
 
05:14:04.830 --> 05:14:04.840 align:start position:0%
or overblow a particular fiscal note uh
 
05:14:06.830 --> 05:14:06.840 align:start position:0%
in the aim of being against this
 
05:14:09.190 --> 05:14:09.200 align:start position:0%
legislation and sometimes it's it's the
 
05:14:11.510 --> 05:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
job of the legislature to say I respect
 
05:14:14.670 --> 05:14:14.680 align:start position:0%
your agency I respect your job here but
 
05:14:16.788 --> 05:14:16.798 align:start position:0%
we are the legislature and we know that
 
05:14:18.628 --> 05:14:18.638 align:start position:0%
this is an important issue and we know
 
05:14:20.590 --> 05:14:20.600 align:start position:0%
that we need to move forward on this
 
05:14:21.910 --> 05:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
issue the other states that have moved
 
05:14:23.910 --> 05:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
forward have had no issue with Federal
 
05:14:26.470 --> 05:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
funding or threats of federal funding
 
05:14:28.990 --> 05:14:29.000 align:start position:0%
and have faced those threats when when
 
05:14:30.788 --> 05:14:30.798 align:start position:0%
being proposed in committee so I would
 
05:14:33.510 --> 05:14:33.520 align:start position:0%
see this as given the fact that the
 
05:14:35.708 --> 05:14:35.718 align:start position:0%
United States of America has shered its
 
05:14:37.708 --> 05:14:37.718 align:start position:0%
responsibility its constitutional
 
05:14:39.910 --> 05:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
responsibility for the last 82 years to
 
05:14:41.788 --> 05:14:41.798 align:start position:0%
declare war that it's time for the
 
05:14:45.350 --> 05:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
states to start taking up its mantle and
 
05:14:47.390 --> 05:14:47.400 align:start position:0%
urging and pushing the United States
 
05:14:49.030 --> 05:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
Congress to do that by withholding our
 
05:14:50.670 --> 05:14:50.680 align:start position:0%
troops if they're not going to take the
 
05:14:53.110 --> 05:14:53.120 align:start position:0%
time to declare and deliberate War but I
 
05:14:55.150 --> 05:14:55.160 align:start position:0%
would agree if if they did then those
 
05:14:57.230 --> 05:14:57.240 align:start position:0%
troops would be ready and able to do
 
05:14:59.990 --> 05:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
that work if they were declaring war and
 
05:15:02.070 --> 05:15:02.080 align:start position:0%
and out there I'm happy to take any
 
05:15:04.470 --> 05:15:04.480 align:start position:0%
questions and I thank you all for your
 
05:15:06.948 --> 05:15:06.958 align:start position:0%
for your opportunity to speak here today
 
05:15:08.310 --> 05:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
 
05:15:11.270 --> 05:15:11.280 align:start position:0%
Mandel bomb thank you Mr chairman so our
 
05:15:13.830 --> 05:15:13.840 align:start position:0%
colleague um Congressman Manion
 
05:15:15.350 --> 05:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned that New Hampshire would be
 
05:15:18.390 --> 05:15:18.400 align:start position:0%
the first state to pass such a bill but
 
05:15:20.470 --> 05:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
from your testimony it sounds like there
 
05:15:22.510 --> 05:15:22.520 align:start position:0%
are other states who have passed bills
 
05:15:23.788 --> 05:15:23.798 align:start position:0%
like this could you just provide a bit
 
05:15:23.798 --> 05:15:24.430 align:start position:0%
like this could you just provide a bit
of

05:15:24.430 --> 05:15:24.440 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:15:26.350 --> 05:15:26.360 align:start position:0%
clarification I was under the impression
 
05:15:33.470 --> 05:15:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:36.628 --> 05:15:36.638 align:start position:0%
bill so the upper chamber had passed the
 
05:15:39.948 --> 05:15:39.958 align:start position:0%
bill with no threats or problems in that
 
05:15:42.070 --> 05:15:42.080 align:start position:0%
that instance thank you for the
 
05:15:46.910 --> 05:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:49.708 --> 05:15:49.718 align:start position:0%
questions repes go ahead representative
 
05:15:51.990 --> 05:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
cyber no I just thought I had a little
 
05:15:54.190 --> 05:15:54.200 align:start position:0%
bit of a clarification on that when I
 
05:15:55.628 --> 05:15:55.638 align:start position:0%
looked at at the upper chamber that's
 
05:15:58.270 --> 05:15:58.280 align:start position:0%
similar to like how it passed our house
 
05:16:01.390 --> 05:16:01.400 align:start position:0%
initially am I correct on that and then
 
05:16:03.590 --> 05:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
was tabled in the
 
05:16:06.110 --> 05:16:06.120 align:start position:0%
Senate the last time around when we had
 
05:16:08.430 --> 05:16:08.440 align:start position:0%
this bill you are correct that would be
 
05:16:10.830 --> 05:16:10.840 align:start position:0%
a similar um comparison so it has not
 
05:16:13.190 --> 05:16:13.200 align:start position:0%
fully passed in any state as I just said
 
05:16:14.990 --> 05:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
to representative mbom thank you for
 
05:16:17.350 --> 05:16:17.360 align:start position:0%
correcting me and I just wanted to did
 
05:16:19.830 --> 05:16:19.840 align:start position:0%
pass in Wyoming and Arizona as I just
 
05:16:21.670 --> 05:16:21.680 align:start position:0%
said to representative M Obama who asked
 
05:16:23.510 --> 05:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
the same question that it passed the
 
05:16:25.470 --> 05:16:25.480 align:start position:0%
state senate in both of those States
 
05:16:27.310 --> 05:16:27.320 align:start position:0%
okay no but I want to clarify was it
 
05:16:30.070 --> 05:16:30.080 align:start position:0%
signed into law by the governor I just
 
05:16:32.150 --> 05:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
answered your
 
05:16:34.390 --> 05:16:34.400 align:start position:0%
question right what what we've heard a
 
05:16:36.628 --> 05:16:36.638 align:start position:0%
couple times is that two other states
 
05:16:38.910 --> 05:16:38.920 align:start position:0%
senates have passed it but their houses
 
05:16:41.390 --> 05:16:41.400 align:start position:0%
did not in this state our house passed
 
05:16:44.470 --> 05:16:44.480 align:start position:0%
it last term but our Senate did not so
 
05:16:47.350 --> 05:16:47.360 align:start position:0%
no State this this measure this type of
 
05:16:50.548 --> 05:16:50.558 align:start position:0%
measure is not uh survive both houses to
 
05:16:52.670 --> 05:16:52.680 align:start position:0%
get to any Governor's desk at least not
 
05:17:00.030 --> 05:17:00.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:03.948 --> 05:17:03.958 align:start position:0%
F Well I just wanted to to clarify since
 
05:17:06.390 --> 05:17:06.400 align:start position:0%
it's never been signed into law you have
 
05:17:08.110 --> 05:17:08.120 align:start position:0%
no way of knowing whether or not these
 
05:17:10.070 --> 05:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
Financial penals would actually come to
 
05:17:12.548 --> 05:17:12.558 align:start position:0%
pass is that
 
05:17:12.558 --> 05:17:14.350 align:start position:0%
pass is that
correct

05:17:14.350 --> 05:17:14.360 align:start position:0%
correct
 
05:17:16.510 --> 05:17:16.520 align:start position:0%
well they have no way of knowing that
 
05:17:18.910 --> 05:17:18.920 align:start position:0%
these Financial penalty I mean from your
 
05:17:20.070 --> 05:17:20.080 align:start position:0%
perspective and the way that you're
 
05:17:21.430 --> 05:17:21.440 align:start position:0%
asking that question they have no way of
 
05:17:22.910 --> 05:17:22.920 align:start position:0%
knowing that these Financial penalties
 
05:17:24.830 --> 05:17:24.840 align:start position:0%
would be imposed in fact the opposite we
 
05:17:27.868 --> 05:17:27.878 align:start position:0%
know that the incoming defense secretary
 
05:17:30.390 --> 05:17:30.400 align:start position:0%
has explicitly stated he supports this
 
05:17:31.788 --> 05:17:31.798 align:start position:0%
type of legislation and would not
 
05:17:33.788 --> 05:17:33.798 align:start position:0%
withhold funds and as I said in my
 
05:17:35.590 --> 05:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
testimony sometimes fiscal notes are
 
05:17:37.750 --> 05:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
wrong and state agencies don't always
 
05:17:39.590 --> 05:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
know what federal government is going to
 
05:17:41.990 --> 05:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
do and sometimes it's used as a scare
 
05:17:44.110 --> 05:17:44.120 align:start position:0%
tactic to keep people from supporting
 
05:17:46.230 --> 05:17:46.240 align:start position:0%
legislation which is quite common sense
 
05:17:47.430 --> 05:17:47.440 align:start position:0%
that's that's my
 
05:17:52.910 --> 05:17:52.920 align:start position:0%
testimony F what um but just to clarify
 
05:17:55.868 --> 05:17:55.878 align:start position:0%
again uh perspective Secretary of
 
05:17:58.788 --> 05:17:58.798 align:start position:0%
Defense uh ped H has also that said that
 
05:18:00.868 --> 05:18:00.878 align:start position:0%
women shouldn't serve in combat and then
 
05:18:03.590 --> 05:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
walked that back so are you saying that
 
05:18:06.470 --> 05:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
we should just assume that what he said
 
05:18:09.868 --> 05:18:09.878 align:start position:0%
before he got confirmed on Fox News is
 
05:18:11.548 --> 05:18:11.558 align:start position:0%
what's actually going to happen I think
 
05:18:13.030 --> 05:18:13.040 align:start position:0%
you're asking a question from a
 
05:18:14.510 --> 05:18:14.520 align:start position:0%
political lens that I'm not going to
 
05:18:16.670 --> 05:18:16.680 align:start position:0%
answer because it's uh frivolous and not
 
05:18:18.030 --> 05:18:18.040 align:start position:0%
to the point of the legislation that
 
05:18:20.150 --> 05:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
we're discussing here
 
05:18:24.070 --> 05:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:27.390 --> 05:18:27.400 align:start position:0%
gagy thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
05:18:29.788 --> 05:18:29.798 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler good to see you
 
05:18:32.590 --> 05:18:32.600 align:start position:0%
again always good to see you first of
 
05:18:34.150 --> 05:18:34.160 align:start position:0%
all just one
 
05:18:36.110 --> 05:18:36.120 align:start position:0%
comment I don't think the federal
 
05:18:37.670 --> 05:18:37.680 align:start position:0%
government will ever get rid of the
 
05:18:39.190 --> 05:18:39.200 align:start position:0%
National Guard because the going to need
 
05:18:43.708 --> 05:18:43.718 align:start position:0%
us it's number one number two uh I know
 
05:18:46.150 --> 05:18:46.160 align:start position:0%
you're a young guy but I was 14 in
 
05:18:49.110 --> 05:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
1958 when the outgoing President
 
05:18:52.190 --> 05:18:52.200 align:start position:0%
Eisenhower warned us about the military
 
05:18:55.150 --> 05:18:55.160 align:start position:0%
industrial complex could you speak on
 
05:18:57.628 --> 05:18:57.638 align:start position:0%
that I could representative gagy you
 
05:19:00.310 --> 05:19:00.320 align:start position:0%
must I you and I didn't even coordinate
 
05:19:02.830 --> 05:19:02.840 align:start position:0%
this that's beautiful but I forgot to
 
05:19:05.628 --> 05:19:05.638 align:start position:0%
what I did forget in my in my testimony
 
05:19:07.830 --> 05:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
EXC excuse me representative uh I want
 
05:19:09.590 --> 05:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
to get into this I want to make sure our
 
05:19:12.310 --> 05:19:12.320 align:start position:0%
focus is on the measure at hand and I
 
05:19:14.390 --> 05:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
think I think I think it could be the
 
05:19:17.030 --> 05:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
the I think I get representative gagne's
 
05:19:20.110 --> 05:19:20.120 align:start position:0%
point it's a quick sure so let's uh
 
05:19:21.590 --> 05:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
let's go ahead and develop that I think
 
05:19:24.430 --> 05:19:24.440 align:start position:0%
what representative gagy was saying is
 
05:19:25.990 --> 05:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely pertinent to what we were
 
05:19:28.350 --> 05:19:28.360 align:start position:0%
talking about here and what President
 
05:19:33.070 --> 05:19:33.080 align:start position:0%
Eisenhower said in 1952 in his farewell
 
05:19:36.150 --> 05:19:36.160 align:start position:0%
address to the American public this is a
 
05:19:39.350 --> 05:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
a piece to that uh one paragraph of that
 
05:19:41.470 --> 05:19:41.480 align:start position:0%
address which I urge this committee to
 
05:19:44.110 --> 05:19:44.120 align:start position:0%
go read it is pertinent in more than one
 
05:19:46.948 --> 05:19:46.958 align:start position:0%
way to what this country is facing right
 
05:19:50.910 --> 05:19:50.920 align:start position:0%
now he said quote this conjunction of an
 
05:19:53.350 --> 05:19:53.360 align:start position:0%
immense military establishment and a
 
05:19:56.070 --> 05:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
large arms industry is new in the
 
05:19:59.310 --> 05:19:59.320 align:start position:0%
American Experience the total influence
 
05:20:02.310 --> 05:20:02.320 align:start position:0%
economic political even spiritual is
 
05:20:05.310 --> 05:20:05.320 align:start position:0%
felt in every city every state house
 
05:20:07.548 --> 05:20:07.558 align:start position:0%
every Office of the federal government
 
05:20:09.788 --> 05:20:09.798 align:start position:0%
we recognize the imperative need for
 
05:20:13.310 --> 05:20:13.320 align:start position:0%
this development yet we toil yet we must
 
05:20:15.670 --> 05:20:15.680 align:start position:0%
not fail to comprehend its grave
 
05:20:18.868 --> 05:20:18.878 align:start position:0%
implications our toil resources and
 
05:20:22.390 --> 05:20:22.400 align:start position:0%
livelihood are all involved so is the
 
05:20:25.590 --> 05:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
very structure of our society in the
 
05:20:27.590 --> 05:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
councils of government we must guard
 
05:20:29.510 --> 05:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
against the acquisition of unwarranted
 
05:20:32.350 --> 05:20:32.360 align:start position:0%
influence whether sought or unsought by
 
05:20:35.470 --> 05:20:35.480 align:start position:0%
the military industrial complex the
 
05:20:37.708 --> 05:20:37.718 align:start position:0%
potential for the disastrous rise of
 
05:20:41.788 --> 05:20:41.798 align:start position:0%
misplaced power exists and will persist
 
05:20:44.070 --> 05:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
and what he was discussing there is that
 
05:20:46.270 --> 05:20:46.280 align:start position:0%
reality that we have seen over the last
 
05:20:49.430 --> 05:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
82 years where a congress which has a
 
05:20:52.230 --> 05:20:52.240 align:start position:0%
constitutional Duty as outlined 248
 
05:20:54.270 --> 05:20:54.280 align:start position:0%
years ago in our founding documents have
 
05:20:57.110 --> 05:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
sh that duty to defense Contracting
 
05:20:59.030 --> 05:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
agencies which have gone about and
 
05:21:01.628 --> 05:21:01.638 align:start position:0%
proposed illegal Wars that have killed
 
05:21:03.868 --> 05:21:03.878 align:start position:0%
millions of people and left our service
 
05:21:05.708 --> 05:21:05.718 align:start position:0%
members and industries feeling like this
 
05:21:08.310 --> 05:21:08.320 align:start position:0%
country doesn't work for them anymore
 
05:21:08.320 --> 05:21:09.390 align:start position:0%
country doesn't work for them anymore
and

05:21:09.390 --> 05:21:09.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:21:12.670 --> 05:21:12.680 align:start position:0%
questions representative cyber so um we
 
05:21:15.150 --> 05:21:15.160 align:start position:0%
have multiple pretty large contracts
 
05:21:16.990 --> 05:21:17.000 align:start position:0%
with companies here that reside in the
 
05:21:18.110 --> 05:21:18.120 align:start position:0%
state of New
 
05:21:20.830 --> 05:21:20.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um so we're going to be
 
05:21:23.948 --> 05:21:23.958 align:start position:0%
stopping Sig sour from their contract
 
05:21:27.670 --> 05:21:27.680 align:start position:0%
currently to create the new machine guns
 
05:21:29.628 --> 05:21:29.638 align:start position:0%
and manufacture the new machine guns for
 
05:21:32.150 --> 05:21:32.160 align:start position:0%
the military industrial complex
 
05:21:34.030 --> 05:21:34.040 align:start position:0%
representative cyber that doesn't that
 
05:21:35.548 --> 05:21:35.558 align:start position:0%
doesn't pertain to the legislation that
 
05:21:36.948 --> 05:21:36.958 align:start position:0%
we have before us
 
05:21:39.548 --> 05:21:39.558 align:start position:0%
here okay I think talking about my
 
05:21:41.430 --> 05:21:41.440 align:start position:0%
concern from my previous comment is that
 
05:21:45.070 --> 05:21:45.080 align:start position:0%
we're drifting a little bit into some uh
 
05:21:45.080 --> 05:21:46.628 align:start position:0%
we're drifting a little bit into some uh
esoteric

05:21:46.628 --> 05:21:46.638 align:start position:0%
esoteric
 
05:21:48.868 --> 05:21:48.878 align:start position:0%
areas uh which I understand the
 
05:21:50.868 --> 05:21:50.878 align:start position:0%
connection that you made and and I let
 
05:21:53.110 --> 05:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
you finish reading from uh president
 
05:21:55.270 --> 05:21:55.280 align:start position:0%
eisen's farewell address which was in
 
05:21:58.708 --> 05:21:58.718 align:start position:0%
January of 1961 to be clear but I want
 
05:22:02.868 --> 05:22:02.878 align:start position:0%
to uh I want to uh not get redundant or
 
05:22:05.070 --> 05:22:05.080 align:start position:0%
repetitive and we're getting there and I
 
05:22:06.948 --> 05:22:06.958 align:start position:0%
want to move on to other speakers but is
 
05:22:10.868 --> 05:22:10.878 align:start position:0%
there any other question for the
 
05:22:13.548 --> 05:22:13.558 align:start position:0%
representative directly related to The
 
05:22:15.510 --> 05:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
Measure at
 
05:22:17.628 --> 05:22:17.638 align:start position:0%
hand and saying none thank you
 
05:22:20.310 --> 05:22:20.320 align:start position:0%
representative much M Mr chair for your
 
05:22:23.190 --> 05:22:23.200 align:start position:0%
time and uh representative Clayton wood
 
05:22:25.788 --> 05:22:25.798 align:start position:0%
uh from Pittsfield is in the house
 
05:22:30.470 --> 05:22:30.480 align:start position:0%

welcome thank you Mr chair and thank you

said I'm representative wood represent
 
05:22:43.030 --> 05:22:43.040 align:start position:0%
me 13 Pittsville and Chester I wasn't
 
05:22:46.030 --> 05:22:46.040 align:start position:0%
going to um sorry I wasn't going to
 
05:22:48.670 --> 05:22:48.680 align:start position:0%
address the committee today uh this
 
05:22:50.548 --> 05:22:50.558 align:start position:0%
seemed to me when I first read it
 
05:22:53.190 --> 05:22:53.200 align:start position:0%
something I would support uh who doesn't
 
05:22:55.350 --> 05:22:55.360 align:start position:0%
want to file the Constitution do I
 
05:22:57.270 --> 05:22:57.280 align:start position:0%
believe we're following the constitution
 
05:22:59.708 --> 05:22:59.718 align:start position:0%
in the case of Nash God absolutely not
 
05:23:01.390 --> 05:23:01.400 align:start position:0%
it didn't take me a lot of research to
 
05:23:04.628 --> 05:23:04.638 align:start position:0%
come to that Co solution I must admit
 
05:23:07.628 --> 05:23:07.638 align:start position:0%
the uh Financial part of this thing did
 
05:23:10.948 --> 05:23:10.958 align:start position:0%
uh is uh concerning do I believe the
 
05:23:13.990 --> 05:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
federal government will do this yes do I
 
05:23:15.590 --> 05:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
I believe they'll do it in a way that we
 
05:23:17.628 --> 05:23:17.638 align:start position:0%
won't even know it's happening we'll
 
05:23:19.868 --> 05:23:19.878 align:start position:0%
we'll be because we don't have equipment
 
05:23:23.788 --> 05:23:23.798 align:start position:0%
working we will not be able to to go to
 
05:23:26.230 --> 05:23:26.240 align:start position:0%
a situation they'll pick another state
 
05:23:28.150 --> 05:23:28.160 align:start position:0%
and keep their equipment working this
 
05:23:32.150 --> 05:23:32.160 align:start position:0%
will be so clean it'll be surgical now
 
05:23:35.470 --> 05:23:35.480 align:start position:0%
speaking about that uh that concerned me
 
05:23:38.548 --> 05:23:38.558 align:start position:0%
coming in here but uh it must have been
 
05:23:40.910 --> 05:23:40.920 align:start position:0%
Faith cuz I was while I was working on
 
05:23:43.310 --> 05:23:43.320 align:start position:0%
this and looking through how the god
 
05:23:46.190 --> 05:23:46.200 align:start position:0%
gets activated which is another another
 
05:23:49.350 --> 05:23:49.360 align:start position:0%
bill that probably should be passed um
 
05:23:52.948 --> 05:23:52.958 align:start position:0%
the several things came up I in the
 
05:23:55.868 --> 05:23:55.878 align:start position:0%
background I have a computer on and uh I
 
05:23:57.470 --> 05:23:57.480 align:start position:0%
find out that we you know we got
 
05:24:00.030 --> 05:24:00.040 align:start position:0%
flooding all over the uh Carolinas
 
05:24:02.590 --> 05:24:02.600 align:start position:0%
everywhere National Guard's not there
 
05:24:03.990 --> 05:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
the National
 
05:24:06.948 --> 05:24:06.958 align:start position:0%
Guard the previous testimony does a
 
05:24:09.350 --> 05:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
great job saying how we get into
 
05:24:11.390 --> 05:24:11.400 align:start position:0%
conflicts it seems like we help
 
05:24:14.390 --> 05:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
everybody as well so the National Guard
 
05:24:16.628 --> 05:24:16.638 align:start position:0%
in uh North Carolina they got three
 
05:24:19.868 --> 05:24:19.878 align:start position:0%
battalions one that I could find is in
 
05:24:22.548 --> 05:24:22.558 align:start position:0%
Africa working on infrastructure the two
 
05:24:24.708 --> 05:24:24.718 align:start position:0%
others I couldn't find them I didn't do
 
05:24:26.230 --> 05:24:26.240 align:start position:0%
a lot of research but they're not
 
05:24:27.948 --> 05:24:27.958 align:start position:0%
available to the governor so we got
 
05:24:31.030 --> 05:24:31.040 align:start position:0%
three battalions in this area definitely
 
05:24:33.910 --> 05:24:33.920 align:start position:0%
have work to do there now do I think the
 
05:24:37.390 --> 05:24:37.400 align:start position:0%
National Guard should be used as a First
 
05:24:39.910 --> 05:24:39.920 align:start position:0%
Alert type of a measure absolutely not
 
05:24:43.230 --> 05:24:43.240 align:start position:0%
but look around you um fires and and
 
05:24:44.990 --> 05:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
North Carolina that didn't come up but
 
05:24:49.190 --> 05:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
what came up was East Palestine Ohio now
 
05:24:51.470 --> 05:24:51.480 align:start position:0%
do you remember that uh going to be
 
05:24:54.548 --> 05:24:54.558 align:start position:0%
two-year anniversary next month it is
 
05:24:57.910 --> 05:24:57.920 align:start position:0%
still a disaster it's unbelievable
 
05:25:00.628 --> 05:25:00.638 align:start position:0%
disaster you may believe it or not but
 
05:25:03.230 --> 05:25:03.240 align:start position:0%
it's not been remedy I look at this as
 
05:25:05.310 --> 05:25:05.320 align:start position:0%
even being more than how we get
 
05:25:07.590 --> 05:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
implemented I look at this as us
 
05:25:10.788 --> 05:25:10.798 align:start position:0%
protecting us state if we have issues in
 
05:25:13.430 --> 05:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
the state unfortunately uh I don't I'm
 
05:25:15.430 --> 05:25:15.440 align:start position:0%
not aware of that require National Guard
 
05:25:17.070 --> 05:25:17.080 align:start position:0%
even though I know National Guard is
 
05:25:19.110 --> 05:25:19.120 align:start position:0%
used for a lot of things helicopter
 
05:25:20.868 --> 05:25:20.878 align:start position:0%
rescues stuff like that that happens all
 
05:25:23.590 --> 05:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
time in state I'm aware of that the um
 
05:25:25.990 --> 05:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
we we need to to protect them and use
 
05:25:29.030 --> 05:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
them am I against sending our National
 
05:25:32.070 --> 05:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
Guard to uh the North Carolinas
 
05:25:34.070 --> 05:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
absolutely not but I mean we just need
 
05:25:36.070 --> 05:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
to know where they are we need to have
 
05:25:38.350 --> 05:25:38.360 align:start position:0%
access to them should they be in Africa
 
05:25:40.548 --> 05:25:40.558 align:start position:0%
I have no idea and I was actually
 
05:25:43.190 --> 05:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
surprised that a uh that a state with
 
05:25:45.110 --> 05:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
three battalions has none available
 
05:25:47.470 --> 05:25:47.480 align:start position:0%
maybe I misread that and I will do some
 
05:25:49.628 --> 05:25:49.638 align:start position:0%
follow-up work on it all I'm saying is
 
05:25:51.590 --> 05:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
that this is not as complicated as a
 
05:25:54.868 --> 05:25:54.878 align:start position:0%
world crisis uh it's as complicated a
 
05:25:56.788 --> 05:25:56.798 align:start position:0%
day-to-day action that our federal
 
05:26:00.070 --> 05:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
government is using our resources for
 
05:26:02.070 --> 05:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
and and and you know they I know they
 
05:26:04.708 --> 05:26:04.718 align:start position:0%
pay a lot for those resources but
 
05:26:06.590 --> 05:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
they're not available to take care of
 
05:26:09.510 --> 05:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
this of this country so I figured all
 
05:26:11.270 --> 05:26:11.280 align:start position:0%
that coincidence I had to least pass it
 
05:26:13.030 --> 05:26:13.040 align:start position:0%
on to this board thank you so much for
 
05:26:15.230 --> 05:26:15.240 align:start position:0%
letting me testify and I will entertain
 
05:26:16.948 --> 05:26:16.958 align:start position:0%
any questions I think the previous
 
05:26:18.628 --> 05:26:18.638 align:start position:0%
speakers have done a great job by the
 
05:26:21.270 --> 05:26:21.280 align:start position:0%
way thank you representative
 
05:26:23.830 --> 05:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
mbom uh thank you Mr chairman um
 
05:26:25.350 --> 05:26:25.360 align:start position:0%
representative would you would you mind
 
05:26:28.150 --> 05:26:28.160 align:start position:0%
just clarifying your position on this
 
05:26:31.030 --> 05:26:31.040 align:start position:0%
bill I will uh vote for the bill all
 
05:26:33.270 --> 05:26:33.280 align:start position:0%
right thank you other
 
05:26:35.830 --> 05:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
questions see uh representative
 
05:26:39.868 --> 05:26:39.878 align:start position:0%
Hemingway sure sir thank you Mr chairman
 
05:26:42.190 --> 05:26:42.200 align:start position:0%
um so you were saying that there was
 
05:26:43.948 --> 05:26:43.958 align:start position:0%
three battalions in New Hampshire and
 
05:26:45.868 --> 05:26:45.878 align:start position:0%
none of them are available not in New
 
05:26:47.830 --> 05:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire North Carolina North Carolina
 
05:26:50.430 --> 05:26:50.440 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
05:26:54.030 --> 05:26:54.040 align:start position:0%
follow um so in New Hampshire we have a
 
05:26:57.430 --> 05:26:57.440 align:start position:0%
Balian unit and they have as from The
 
05:26:58.788 --> 05:26:58.798 align:start position:0%
Briefing that we had this morning we
 
05:27:00.868 --> 05:27:00.878 align:start position:0%
have the high Mars which is a highly
 
05:27:00.878 --> 05:27:02.190 align:start position:0%
have the high Mars which is a highly
sought-after

05:27:02.190 --> 05:27:02.200 align:start position:0%
sought-after
 
05:27:05.788 --> 05:27:05.798 align:start position:0%
weapon um and we also have the the
 
05:27:07.670 --> 05:27:07.680 align:start position:0%
refuelers which has the newest uh
 
05:27:09.628 --> 05:27:09.638 align:start position:0%
equipment out there so if we were to
 
05:27:13.350 --> 05:27:13.360 align:start position:0%
take and say no defend the guard and we
 
05:27:16.750 --> 05:27:16.760 align:start position:0%
start losing money as a previous uh
 
05:27:18.350 --> 05:27:18.360 align:start position:0%
representative was talking about in the
 
05:27:21.270 --> 05:27:21.280 align:start position:0%
Readiness status uh which is in fact
 
05:27:26.390 --> 05:27:26.400 align:start position:0%
true um would you not see where we would
 
05:27:30.868 --> 05:27:30.878 align:start position:0%
lose that ability and the the training
 
05:27:34.190 --> 05:27:34.200 align:start position:0%
uh efficiency on that thank you for the
 
05:27:36.150 --> 05:27:36.160 align:start position:0%
question is actually good question and
 
05:27:37.990 --> 05:27:38.000 align:start position:0%
it does concern me I would be clear with
 
05:27:38.000 --> 05:27:38.670 align:start position:0%
it does concern me I would be clear with
that

05:27:38.670 --> 05:27:38.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:27:41.788 --> 05:27:41.798 align:start position:0%
I actually think we need I love New
 
05:27:43.390 --> 05:27:43.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we're the first at everything
 
05:27:45.070 --> 05:27:45.080 align:start position:0%
if we could be the first one to pass
 
05:27:49.350 --> 05:27:49.360 align:start position:0%
this bill I believe we will we will uh
 
05:27:51.150 --> 05:27:51.160 align:start position:0%
create an environment where this bill
 
05:27:54.150 --> 05:27:54.160 align:start position:0%
will we pass and we can use our troops
 
05:27:57.070 --> 05:27:57.080 align:start position:0%
this only threatens us if we're the only
 
05:28:00.590 --> 05:28:00.600 align:start position:0%
state as more states do it that threat
 
05:28:02.628 --> 05:28:02.638 align:start position:0%
is less and less cuz I agree with one
 
05:28:04.310 --> 05:28:04.320 align:start position:0%
gentleman said I'm sorry if I I didn't
 
05:28:06.150 --> 05:28:06.160 align:start position:0%
remember the name they need us may have
 
05:28:09.350 --> 05:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
been you they need us I know that that
 
05:28:13.070 --> 05:28:13.080 align:start position:0%
but uh they will I know well that's my
 
05:28:14.670 --> 05:28:14.680 align:start position:0%
answer thank
 
05:28:16.548 --> 05:28:16.558 align:start position:0%
you follow
 
05:28:21.310 --> 05:28:21.320 align:start position:0%
up yes sir thank you chair um so if we
 
05:28:23.990 --> 05:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
were to pass defend the garden it would
 
05:28:26.948 --> 05:28:26.958 align:start position:0%
go through where do you see New
 
05:28:30.150 --> 05:28:30.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire being as far as their um and
 
05:28:32.070 --> 05:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
I'm interested in how this would be what
 
05:28:34.070 --> 05:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
would be our primary Mission I mean our
 
05:28:35.628 --> 05:28:35.638 align:start position:0%
our primary mission is to defend New
 
05:28:38.670 --> 05:28:38.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the United States with a
 
05:28:42.070 --> 05:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
fur with a further on uh overseas as as
 
05:28:44.548 --> 05:28:44.558 align:start position:0%
directed but as as we take this and
 
05:28:46.788 --> 05:28:46.798 align:start position:0%
we're no longer focusing our training on
 
05:28:49.070 --> 05:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
the artillery the mil the military
 
05:28:52.590 --> 05:28:52.600 align:start position:0%
police the the metac unit that we have
 
05:28:54.868 --> 05:28:54.878 align:start position:0%
the air guard unit that we have where do
 
05:28:57.510 --> 05:28:57.520 align:start position:0%
you see that mission running yeah
 
05:28:59.910 --> 05:28:59.920 align:start position:0%
another good question uh just a little
 
05:29:02.548 --> 05:29:02.558 align:start position:0%
bit of uh uh research on this there is a
 
05:29:05.390 --> 05:29:05.400 align:start position:0%
way of of activating the God and the go
 
05:29:06.948 --> 05:29:06.958 align:start position:0%
federal government is involved is
 
05:29:09.190 --> 05:29:09.200 align:start position:0%
clearly they they use training Advanced
 
05:29:12.430 --> 05:29:12.440 align:start position:0%
Training uh code to implement them if
 
05:29:14.868 --> 05:29:14.878 align:start position:0%
they stay in this country and part of
 
05:29:17.190 --> 05:29:17.200 align:start position:0%
part of the solution and not part of a
 
05:29:19.868 --> 05:29:19.878 align:start position:0%
problem I'm for that I I think New
 
05:29:21.470 --> 05:29:21.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire takes care of themselves I
 
05:29:24.628 --> 05:29:24.638 align:start position:0%
don't see a lot of cases so far uh we we
 
05:29:26.628 --> 05:29:26.638 align:start position:0%
know how to take care of ourselves we
 
05:29:28.310 --> 05:29:28.320 align:start position:0%
know how to put out fires we know how to
 
05:29:30.190 --> 05:29:30.200 align:start position:0%
do some of the stuff that other places
 
05:29:32.670 --> 05:29:32.680 align:start position:0%
have forgotten how to do uh but there's
 
05:29:34.868 --> 05:29:34.878 align:start position:0%
floods there's national disasters I
 
05:29:36.548 --> 05:29:36.558 align:start position:0%
think uh when I was looking at this
 
05:29:38.868 --> 05:29:38.878 align:start position:0%
quickly Louisiana had the same issue
 
05:29:42.628 --> 05:29:42.638 align:start position:0%
with no um National Gods communication
 
05:29:44.670 --> 05:29:44.680 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of places that I think the
 
05:29:46.750 --> 05:29:46.760 align:start position:0%
national God would fit in and they don't
 
05:29:49.670 --> 05:29:49.680 align:start position:0%
have to be in New Hampshire and and and
 
05:29:52.150 --> 05:29:52.160 align:start position:0%
and doing what we want to do uh you know
 
05:29:53.990 --> 05:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
we we want we want to be first in the
 
05:29:55.628 --> 05:29:55.638 align:start position:0%
nation we want to take care of ourselves
 
05:29:58.628 --> 05:29:58.638 align:start position:0%
we want to take care of the rest of of
 
05:30:00.868 --> 05:30:00.878 align:start position:0%
of uh the citizens too as well so I look
 
05:30:03.150 --> 05:30:03.160 align:start position:0%
at at a big picture I have absolutely no
 
05:30:05.548 --> 05:30:05.558 align:start position:0%
problem I have no problem if they're
 
05:30:06.990 --> 05:30:07.000 align:start position:0%
outside of this country if there's a
 
05:30:09.910 --> 05:30:09.920 align:start position:0%
reason actually that training code that
 
05:30:13.150 --> 05:30:13.160 align:start position:0%
I barely look through says it's supposed
 
05:30:15.948 --> 05:30:15.958 align:start position:0%
to be in our territories in in this
 
05:30:18.590 --> 05:30:18.600 align:start position:0%
country it has nothing to say about
 
05:30:21.628 --> 05:30:21.638 align:start position:0%
being outside of of the country however
 
05:30:23.708 --> 05:30:23.718 align:start position:0%
I do realize they call up other codes
 
05:30:25.750 --> 05:30:25.760 align:start position:0%
too and I didn't get that far into it
 
05:30:28.510 --> 05:30:28.520 align:start position:0%
this is way too complicated and it's
 
05:30:31.110 --> 05:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
it's it's time for a state to draw a
 
05:30:33.788 --> 05:30:33.798 align:start position:0%
line and correct it and I'm not looking
 
05:30:37.990 --> 05:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
at changing a lot but changing to me the
 
05:30:40.670 --> 05:30:40.680 align:start position:0%
important parts which which were
 
05:30:42.868 --> 05:30:42.878 align:start position:0%
mentioned very uh carefully by some of
 
05:30:45.110 --> 05:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
the other speakers as well thank you
 
05:30:45.120 --> 05:30:45.910 align:start position:0%
the other speakers as well thank you
other

05:30:45.910 --> 05:30:45.920 align:start position:0%
other
 
05:30:48.430 --> 05:30:48.440 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you
 
05:30:50.430 --> 05:30:50.440 align:start position:0%
representative thank okay I have two
 
05:30:53.788 --> 05:30:53.798 align:start position:0%
more cards from uh state representatives
 
05:30:55.510 --> 05:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
which we will go to and I know some of
 
05:30:56.670 --> 05:30:56.680 align:start position:0%
the folks that are here and some of the
 
05:30:58.708 --> 05:30:58.718 align:start position:0%
folks are watching uh very much want to
 
05:31:01.990 --> 05:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
hear from um Major General mtis who is
 
05:31:04.070 --> 05:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
here so just FYI we're going to go to
 
05:31:07.150 --> 05:31:07.160 align:start position:0%
the the uh two reps and then um General
 
05:31:10.310 --> 05:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
mtis is here and I know uh he uh
 
05:31:12.110 --> 05:31:12.120 align:start position:0%
certainly he is the head of the guard in
 
05:31:14.868 --> 05:31:14.878 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so he he will be on double
 
05:31:18.230 --> 05:31:18.240 align:start position:0%
deck following uh these next two uh
 
05:31:20.948 --> 05:31:20.958 align:start position:0%
representative Murray is in the house
 
05:31:22.868 --> 05:31:22.878 align:start position:0%
there she is
 
05:31:25.390 --> 05:31:25.400 align:start position:0%
welcome she supports the bill and has
 
05:31:27.390 --> 05:31:27.400 align:start position:0%
asked for two
 
05:31:29.868 --> 05:31:29.878 align:start position:0%
minutes thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:31:31.270 --> 05:31:31.280 align:start position:0%
to the committee members for hearing me
 
05:31:33.868 --> 05:31:33.878 align:start position:0%
today I don't want to repeat too much of
 
05:31:36.470 --> 05:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
what my colleagues have already said but
 
05:31:38.750 --> 05:31:38.760 align:start position:0%
um I do want to focus in on this part
 
05:31:40.830 --> 05:31:40.840 align:start position:0%
around the financials and the
 
05:31:43.510 --> 05:31:43.520 align:start position:0%
constitutionality of
 
05:31:47.270 --> 05:31:47.280 align:start position:0%
this just based on the facts Congress is
 
05:31:49.470 --> 05:31:49.480 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional uh unconstitutionally
 
05:31:51.948 --> 05:31:51.958 align:start position:0%
delegating their responsibilities to the
 
05:31:53.670 --> 05:31:53.680 align:start position:0%
president whether it's through the
 
05:31:55.390 --> 05:31:55.400 align:start position:0%
author authorization for the use of
 
05:31:57.310 --> 05:31:57.320 align:start position:0%
military force or through the War Powers
 
05:31:59.990 --> 05:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
Resolution both of those are un
 
05:32:02.110 --> 05:32:02.120 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional so that's an abdication
 
05:32:04.190 --> 05:32:04.200 align:start position:0%
of their duties as our representatives
 
05:32:06.470 --> 05:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
in Congress um that should not be
 
05:32:09.030 --> 05:32:09.040 align:start position:0%
happening like Point Blank period
 
05:32:11.510 --> 05:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
and for me this is so interesting to
 
05:32:13.510 --> 05:32:13.520 align:start position:0%
look at especially you know being here
 
05:32:16.470 --> 05:32:16.480 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire I can't think of any
 
05:32:18.110 --> 05:32:18.120 align:start position:0%
other case at least off the top of my
 
05:32:20.190 --> 05:32:20.200 align:start position:0%
head where we're letting the federal
 
05:32:23.670 --> 05:32:23.680 align:start position:0%
government coers us into upholding
 
05:32:26.150 --> 05:32:26.160 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional law because they're
 
05:32:29.110 --> 05:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
holding this money above our heads and
 
05:32:31.030 --> 05:32:31.040 align:start position:0%
telling us if you don't comply then you
 
05:32:33.430 --> 05:32:33.440 align:start position:0%
don't get these funds and I don't think
 
05:32:36.670 --> 05:32:36.680 align:start position:0%
we should let those threats keep us from
 
05:32:38.948 --> 05:32:38.958 align:start position:0%
uh changing what we know to be wrong and
 
05:32:41.868 --> 05:32:41.878 align:start position:0%
what we know to be um unconstitutional
 
05:32:43.430 --> 05:32:43.440 align:start position:0%
especially when we all took an oath of
 
05:32:45.868 --> 05:32:45.878 align:start position:0%
office to uphold our Constitution and my
 
05:32:47.628 --> 05:32:47.638 align:start position:0%
opinion they're coercing us to break
 
05:32:50.150 --> 05:32:50.160 align:start position:0%
that oath and I don't think we should be
 
05:32:51.350 --> 05:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
letting the federal government
 
05:32:53.510 --> 05:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
intimidate Us in that way um into
 
05:32:55.948 --> 05:32:55.958 align:start position:0%
upholding this law and like my other
 
05:32:58.110 --> 05:32:58.120 align:start position:0%
colleagues have mentioned I think we can
 
05:32:59.990 --> 05:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
really set an example as the first state
 
05:33:02.750 --> 05:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
to take this step and by taking the step
 
05:33:04.070 --> 05:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
and breaking the ice and being the first
 
05:33:06.390 --> 05:33:06.400 align:start position:0%
ones we will Empower other states to
 
05:33:08.868 --> 05:33:08.878 align:start position:0%
make the same changes then it will be a
 
05:33:10.670 --> 05:33:10.680 align:start position:0%
lot harder for the federal government to
 
05:33:13.270 --> 05:33:13.280 align:start position:0%
enforce um you know take away funds from
 
05:33:14.910 --> 05:33:14.920 align:start position:0%
a billion different states that are all
 
05:33:16.590 --> 05:33:16.600 align:start position:0%
passing this legislation if we all take
 
05:33:19.670 --> 05:33:19.680 align:start position:0%
this step forward together um and I
 
05:33:22.110 --> 05:33:22.120 align:start position:0%
wanted to read um one quote from James
 
05:33:23.708 --> 05:33:23.718 align:start position:0%
Madison that I think really speaks to
 
05:33:26.750 --> 05:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
this the Constitution supposes what the
 
05:33:28.990 --> 05:33:29.000 align:start position:0%
history of all governments demonstrates
 
05:33:30.750 --> 05:33:30.760 align:start position:0%
that the executive is the branch of
 
05:33:33.510 --> 05:33:33.520 align:start position:0%
power most interested in war and most
 
05:33:35.590 --> 05:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
prone to it it has accordingly with
 
05:33:37.830 --> 05:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
studied care vested the question of War
 
05:33:40.110 --> 05:33:40.120 align:start position:0%
in the legislature and I think that is
 
05:33:42.548 --> 05:33:42.558 align:start position:0%
really crucial to remember we don't want
 
05:33:44.910 --> 05:33:44.920 align:start position:0%
to have a commander-in-chief who has the
 
05:33:47.628 --> 05:33:47.638 align:start position:0%
sole authority to both be enacting the
 
05:33:49.708 --> 05:33:49.718 align:start position:0%
calls to war and calling us to war
 
05:33:51.708 --> 05:33:51.718 align:start position:0%
because that's authoritarianism we need
 
05:33:53.948 --> 05:33:53.958 align:start position:0%
to have balances and checks and balances
 
05:33:55.910 --> 05:33:55.920 align:start position:0%
on Power and that is why our
 
05:33:58.110 --> 05:33:58.120 align:start position:0%
constitution was written the way it was
 
05:33:59.470 --> 05:33:59.480 align:start position:0%
but that's all I had to say I'm willing
 
05:34:01.548 --> 05:34:01.558 align:start position:0%
to take questions are there any
 
05:34:05.070 --> 05:34:05.080 align:start position:0%
questions for representative
 
05:34:08.310 --> 05:34:08.320 align:start position:0%
Murray representative Mandel bomb
 
05:34:10.708 --> 05:34:10.718 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um representative
 
05:34:14.030 --> 05:34:14.040 align:start position:0%
maray you and um some of our colleagues
 
05:34:16.430 --> 05:34:16.440 align:start position:0%
who've testified um on behalf of this
 
05:34:19.510 --> 05:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
Bill had mentioned that if multiple
 
05:34:22.750 --> 05:34:22.760 align:start position:0%
states were to pass similar bills um the
 
05:34:24.190 --> 05:34:24.200 align:start position:0%
federal government potentially
 
05:34:26.270 --> 05:34:26.280 align:start position:0%
withholding funding would be less of an
 
05:34:31.310 --> 05:34:31.320 align:start position:0%
issue are there similar instances where
 
05:34:35.030 --> 05:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
maybe perhaps for other issues where
 
05:34:38.868 --> 05:34:38.878 align:start position:0%
because multiple States have asked a
 
05:34:40.830 --> 05:34:40.840 align:start position:0%
bill the federal government has said you
 
05:34:43.110 --> 05:34:43.120 align:start position:0%
know what we're not going to cut funding
 
05:34:45.430 --> 05:34:45.440 align:start position:0%
as opposed to just is that is that clear
 
05:34:46.628 --> 05:34:46.638 align:start position:0%
yeah no I definitely understand what
 
05:34:48.510 --> 05:34:48.520 align:start position:0%
you're asking I can't think of like a
 
05:34:50.708 --> 05:34:50.718 align:start position:0%
perfect example off the top of my head
 
05:34:52.628 --> 05:34:52.638 align:start position:0%
but I think there's a lot of um
 
05:34:54.548 --> 05:34:54.558 align:start position:0%
instances where we've seen States wield
 
05:34:56.910 --> 05:34:56.920 align:start position:0%
their power either singularly or
 
05:34:59.590 --> 05:34:59.600 align:start position:0%
together in Coalition when they see um
 
05:35:01.030 --> 05:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
or when they have disagreements with the
 
05:35:03.948 --> 05:35:03.958 align:start position:0%
government um for example um and maybe I
 
05:35:06.030 --> 05:35:06.040 align:start position:0%
don't personally agree with this but uh
 
05:35:08.910 --> 05:35:08.920 align:start position:0%
I believe last year it was that um the
 
05:35:11.110 --> 05:35:11.120 align:start position:0%
governor in Texas you know wasn't
 
05:35:13.390 --> 05:35:13.400 align:start position:0%
complying with the federal government on
 
05:35:16.910 --> 05:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
certain issues regarding the border and
 
05:35:19.470 --> 05:35:19.480 align:start position:0%
the federal government did not move
 
05:35:21.548 --> 05:35:21.558 align:start position:0%
forward on forcing them to comply
 
05:35:23.190 --> 05:35:23.200 align:start position:0%
because they had that kind of like
 
05:35:26.708 --> 05:35:26.718 align:start position:0%
political power to um I mean kind of
 
05:35:27.750 --> 05:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
being like what are you going to do
 
05:35:29.750 --> 05:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
about it you know and if we have enough
 
05:35:31.510 --> 05:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
states that are passing this kind of
 
05:35:32.788 --> 05:35:32.798 align:start position:0%
legislation I think we'll be in a
 
05:35:34.830 --> 05:35:34.840 align:start position:0%
similar position where we're like this
 
05:35:36.990 --> 05:35:37.000 align:start position:0%
is unconstitutional we are no longer
 
05:35:39.190 --> 05:35:39.200 align:start position:0%
willing to comply with something that is
 
05:35:39.200 --> 05:35:40.150 align:start position:0%
willing to comply with something that is
clearly

05:35:40.150 --> 05:35:40.160 align:start position:0%
clearly
 
05:35:43.628 --> 05:35:43.638 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional and yeah what are what
 
05:35:46.510 --> 05:35:46.520 align:start position:0%
are they going to do about it thank you
 
05:35:49.390 --> 05:35:49.400 align:start position:0%
thanks representative you just mentioned
 
05:35:51.230 --> 05:35:51.240 align:start position:0%
constitutionality and we've heard that
 
05:35:53.548 --> 05:35:53.558 align:start position:0%
time and again uh there are some folks
 
05:35:55.910 --> 05:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
who think that it is not
 
05:35:57.830 --> 05:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional you think it is
 
05:35:59.990 --> 05:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional I'm hearing both of
 
05:36:04.310 --> 05:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
those my question for you is do we want
 
05:36:06.670 --> 05:36:06.680 align:start position:0%
to take the do you think there is a risk
 
05:36:10.110 --> 05:36:10.120 align:start position:0%
in defang our National Guard uh to make
 
05:36:12.830 --> 05:36:12.840 align:start position:0%
a a larger point about constitutionality
 
05:36:15.868 --> 05:36:15.878 align:start position:0%
and and executive versus congressional
 
05:36:18.788 --> 05:36:18.798 align:start position:0%
power uh is that a concern to you that
 
05:36:21.190 --> 05:36:21.200 align:start position:0%
uh if if you're correct on the
 
05:36:23.190 --> 05:36:23.200 align:start position:0%
constitutionality is it do you think
 
05:36:26.030 --> 05:36:26.040 align:start position:0%
it's worth uh degrading our National
 
05:36:28.190 --> 05:36:28.200 align:start position:0%
Guard uh and I know there's an argument
 
05:36:30.510 --> 05:36:30.520 align:start position:0%
that they would never dare defund us but
 
05:36:32.590 --> 05:36:32.600 align:start position:0%
you get you understand my question are
 
05:36:34.470 --> 05:36:34.480 align:start position:0%
you concerned about If This Were to move
 
05:36:36.510 --> 05:36:36.520 align:start position:0%
forward uh that it would degrade our
 
05:36:38.030 --> 05:36:38.040 align:start position:0%
National Guard in the in the local
 
05:36:41.670 --> 05:36:41.680 align:start position:0%
missions that we depend on our guard for
 
05:36:43.470 --> 05:36:43.480 align:start position:0%
yeah I I definitely hear that I
 
05:36:45.750 --> 05:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
definitely think that there is a risk
 
05:36:47.230 --> 05:36:47.240 align:start position:0%
that is being taken by passing
 
05:36:49.788 --> 05:36:49.798 align:start position:0%
legislation like this but I think we as
 
05:36:52.628 --> 05:36:52.638 align:start position:0%
a state would come together if we needed
 
05:36:55.548 --> 05:36:55.558 align:start position:0%
to to find more funds to um continue
 
05:36:57.788 --> 05:36:57.798 align:start position:0%
supporting our National Guard I am not
 
05:36:59.548 --> 05:36:59.558 align:start position:0%
an expert on the budget by any means but
 
05:37:03.868 --> 05:37:03.878 align:start position:0%
I know that we do not have the amount of
 
05:37:05.750 --> 05:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
Guardsmen right now that we have
 
05:37:07.990 --> 05:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
allocated funds for so in my mind and
 
05:37:09.190 --> 05:37:09.200 align:start position:0%
again I'm not an expert but there's
 
05:37:10.708 --> 05:37:10.718 align:start position:0%
already money that we're not spending
 
05:37:14.310 --> 05:37:14.320 align:start position:0%
right now that we have um and I think
 
05:37:16.110 --> 05:37:16.120 align:start position:0%
we've seen this happen with other
 
05:37:19.110 --> 05:37:19.120 align:start position:0%
legislation I believe we have um uh a
 
05:37:21.948 --> 05:37:21.958 align:start position:0%
law around not enforcing
 
05:37:24.750 --> 05:37:24.760 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional um laws relating to
 
05:37:27.868 --> 05:37:27.878 align:start position:0%
guns like from the AFT um like any
 
05:37:30.190 --> 05:37:30.200 align:start position:0%
regulations around that and we are also
 
05:37:31.830 --> 05:37:31.840 align:start position:0%
taking risks in that area by not
 
05:37:33.230 --> 05:37:33.240 align:start position:0%
complying with those things and I see
 
05:37:35.310 --> 05:37:35.320 align:start position:0%
this as a similar you know New Hampshire
 
05:37:37.670 --> 05:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
has such a dedication to being like live
 
05:37:39.190 --> 05:37:39.200 align:start position:0%
for your die State we live by the
 
05:37:41.070 --> 05:37:41.080 align:start position:0%
Constitution we live by our state
 
05:37:43.830 --> 05:37:43.840 align:start position:0%
constitution and we don't let the
 
05:37:45.750 --> 05:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
federal government bully us and this is
 
05:37:49.230 --> 05:37:49.240 align:start position:0%
such a clear in my opinion they are
 
05:37:52.070 --> 05:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
coercing us into maintaining
 
05:37:55.470 --> 05:37:55.480 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional law and we're really
 
05:37:58.628 --> 05:37:58.638 align:start position:0%
not saying that we're not willing to um
 
05:38:01.708 --> 05:38:01.718 align:start position:0%
send our Guardsmen into war or into
 
05:38:03.430 --> 05:38:03.440 align:start position:0%
active combat we're saying that they
 
05:38:06.070 --> 05:38:06.080 align:start position:0%
need to demand that in a constitutional
 
05:38:07.470 --> 05:38:07.480 align:start position:0%
way and they need to follow a con
 
05:38:10.070 --> 05:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
constitutional process um so I do think
 
05:38:12.150 --> 05:38:12.160 align:start position:0%
there's a risk that in my opinion um
 
05:38:14.708 --> 05:38:14.718 align:start position:0%
adhering to our constitution is worth
 
05:38:19.390 --> 05:38:19.400 align:start position:0%
that risk other questions representative
 
05:38:21.350 --> 05:38:21.360 align:start position:0%
Jones uh thank you Mr chair you know
 
05:38:22.990 --> 05:38:23.000 align:start position:0%
what I thank you very much for being
 
05:38:24.470 --> 05:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
here and for your points uh I just
 
05:38:26.190 --> 05:38:26.200 align:start position:0%
realized I think my question will be
 
05:38:27.670 --> 05:38:27.680 align:start position:0%
answered when the general speaks so I'm
 
05:38:31.470 --> 05:38:31.480 align:start position:0%
going to pass I think there is truth to
 
05:38:32.868 --> 05:38:32.878 align:start position:0%
what you just
 
05:38:36.468 --> 05:38:36.478 align:start position:0%
said okay uh thank you representative uh
 
05:38:39.070 --> 05:38:39.080 align:start position:0%
one more uh state rep uh sticking with
 
05:38:41.030 --> 05:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
our our tradition representative Heath
 
05:38:43.350 --> 05:38:43.360 align:start position:0%
Howard is in support of the bill and
 
05:38:45.990 --> 05:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
he's asked for three minutes welcome
 
05:38:46.000 --> 05:38:48.270 align:start position:0%
he's asked for three minutes welcome
back

05:38:48.270 --> 05:38:48.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:50.708 --> 05:38:50.718 align:start position:0%
representative thank
 
05:38:53.468 --> 05:38:53.478 align:start position:0%
you thank you honorable chair and uh
 
05:38:55.110 --> 05:38:55.120 align:start position:0%
committee members uh my name is
 
05:38:56.750 --> 05:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
representative Heath Howard I represent
 
05:38:58.310 --> 05:38:58.320 align:start position:0%
the towns of straford and barington in
 
05:39:01.750 --> 05:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
straford District 4 I support HB 104
 
05:39:03.230 --> 05:39:03.240 align:start position:0%
because the purpose of the National
 
05:39:05.270 --> 05:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
Guard is to defend our nation to be
 
05:39:07.150 --> 05:39:07.160 align:start position:0%
blunt I failed to see how deploying
 
05:39:09.910 --> 05:39:09.920 align:start position:0%
these troops overseas uh defends our
 
05:39:11.670 --> 05:39:11.680 align:start position:0%
nation without an official declaration
 
05:39:14.830 --> 05:39:14.840 align:start position:0%
of war we have become accustomed to a
 
05:39:17.548 --> 05:39:17.558 align:start position:0%
practice that cuts corners and fails to
 
05:39:19.670 --> 05:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
meet basic constitutional requirements
 
05:39:21.910 --> 05:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
because it is in compliance with
 
05:39:25.548 --> 05:39:25.558 align:start position:0%
aumf like my friend from pelum had said
 
05:39:27.830 --> 05:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh this seeds constitutional
 
05:39:30.230 --> 05:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
responsibility from Congress to the
 
05:39:33.070 --> 05:39:33.080 align:start position:0%
executive branch this is about trying to
 
05:39:35.788 --> 05:39:35.798 align:start position:0%
ensure proper constitutional process is
 
05:39:37.830 --> 05:39:37.840 align:start position:0%
followed in my opin
 
05:39:41.110 --> 05:39:41.120 align:start position:0%
funding concerns are speculative at best
 
05:39:42.948 --> 05:39:42.958 align:start position:0%
uh in my life I have never seen the
 
05:39:45.708 --> 05:39:45.718 align:start position:0%
federal government to fund the military
 
05:39:47.510 --> 05:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
and the placement of our federal
 
05:39:50.230 --> 05:39:50.240 align:start position:0%
delegation uh on the relevant committees
 
05:39:52.310 --> 05:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
to National Guard funding makes it
 
05:39:52.320 --> 05:39:53.788 align:start position:0%
to National Guard funding makes it
extremely

05:39:53.788 --> 05:39:53.798 align:start position:0%
extremely
 
05:39:56.788 --> 05:39:56.798 align:start position:0%
unlikely we have infrastructure in this
 
05:39:58.070 --> 05:39:58.080 align:start position:0%
state that the federal government will
 
05:40:00.230 --> 05:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
not abandon and I also do not believe
 
05:40:01.670 --> 05:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
that the federal government would
 
05:40:03.708 --> 05:40:03.718 align:start position:0%
abandon a state and refuse things like
 
05:40:06.468 --> 05:40:06.478 align:start position:0%
disaster Aid this legislation is not
 
05:40:09.030 --> 05:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
only anti-war War an anti-authoritarian
 
05:40:11.430 --> 05:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
but Pro constitutionality and I think
 
05:40:13.628 --> 05:40:13.638 align:start position:0%
you should be placing the Constitutional
 
05:40:17.430 --> 05:40:17.440 align:start position:0%
process uh first over shaky rumors about
 
05:40:20.030 --> 05:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
reduced funding thank
 
05:40:22.990 --> 05:40:23.000 align:start position:0%
you did you say questions uh yes are
 
05:40:24.990 --> 05:40:25.000 align:start position:0%
there any
 
05:40:27.110 --> 05:40:27.120 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you
 
05:40:31.150 --> 05:40:31.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:34.708 --> 05:40:34.718 align:start position:0%
you okay at this time uh Major General
 
05:40:37.990 --> 05:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
molus is the uh Adit General the head of
 
05:40:40.150 --> 05:40:40.160 align:start position:0%
the National Guard which is the subject
 
05:40:43.430 --> 05:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
obviously of this uh of this measure and
 
05:40:45.868 --> 05:40:45.878 align:start position:0%
uh I'm sure there were many folks very
 
05:40:48.030 --> 05:40:48.040 align:start position:0%
interested in in what the general has to
 
05:40:50.830 --> 05:40:50.840 align:start position:0%
say and uh I'm sure he'll take questions
 
05:40:52.948 --> 05:40:52.958 align:start position:0%
he's asked he opposes the
 
05:40:55.510 --> 05:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
bill uh he's already submitted
 
05:40:59.190 --> 05:40:59.200 align:start position:0%
significant uh uh testimony written
 
05:41:03.150 --> 05:41:03.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:08.590 --> 05:41:08.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:10.788 --> 05:41:10.798 align:start position:0%
uh thank you sir uh for the record uh
 
05:41:13.150 --> 05:41:13.160 align:start position:0%
Major General David melus the AG general
 
05:41:14.830 --> 05:41:14.840 align:start position:0%
for the New Hampshire National
 
05:41:17.190 --> 05:41:17.200 align:start position:0%
Guard so in front of you is written
 
05:41:19.910 --> 05:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
testimony um I sent that uh in advance
 
05:41:22.270 --> 05:41:22.280 align:start position:0%
but in addition to the back of that
 
05:41:25.990 --> 05:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
document is what's called Public Law
 
05:41:29.230 --> 05:41:29.240 align:start position:0%
10740 Congress passed it in 2001 which
 
05:41:31.390 --> 05:41:31.400 align:start position:0%
discusses the authoriz authorization of
 
05:41:33.070 --> 05:41:33.080 align:start position:0%
use the military
 
05:41:35.948 --> 05:41:35.958 align:start position:0%
force so let's take a step back and a
 
05:41:37.868 --> 05:41:37.878 align:start position:0%
lot has been said let's try to distill
 
05:41:41.190 --> 05:41:41.200 align:start position:0%
this into two big buckets um one is my
 
05:41:43.350 --> 05:41:43.360 align:start position:0%
first thing I would offer to you is you
 
05:41:46.548 --> 05:41:46.558 align:start position:0%
know when you read that u u the public
 
05:41:50.110 --> 05:41:50.120 align:start position:0%
law this bill being opposed is the wrong
 
05:41:51.910 --> 05:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
legislation and the wrong legislative
 
05:41:54.750 --> 05:41:54.760 align:start position:0%
body this bill is not so is not so
 
05:41:57.590 --> 05:41:57.600 align:start position:0%
veiled attempt to circumvent federal law
 
05:42:00.030 --> 05:42:00.040 align:start position:0%
and the federal legislative process
 
05:42:02.230 --> 05:42:02.240 align:start position:0%
everyone here today has discussed their
 
05:42:04.030 --> 05:42:04.040 align:start position:0%
upset with Congress and the president
 
05:42:06.150 --> 05:42:06.160 align:start position:0%
and who has who has advocated the war
 
05:42:07.670 --> 05:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
power responsibility
 
05:42:10.150 --> 05:42:10.160 align:start position:0%
that is for Congress to decide that is
 
05:42:13.070 --> 05:42:13.080 align:start position:0%
not for this venue this legislative body
 
05:42:15.030 --> 05:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
and for us to try to interpret does the
 
05:42:17.150 --> 05:42:17.160 align:start position:0%
authorization use the military force
 
05:42:18.868 --> 05:42:18.878 align:start position:0%
with has allowed our men and women to go
 
05:42:20.910 --> 05:42:20.920 align:start position:0%
into Harm's Way whether it's valid or
 
05:42:23.230 --> 05:42:23.240 align:start position:0%
not so let's just cut to the chase this
 
05:42:25.510 --> 05:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
is Romper Room right it's up to Congress
 
05:42:29.310 --> 05:42:29.320 align:start position:0%
to decide that not us number two what is
 
05:42:30.510 --> 05:42:30.520 align:start position:0%
a National
 
05:42:32.868 --> 05:42:32.878 align:start position:0%
Guard I I chuckle when those who have
 
05:42:34.468 --> 05:42:34.478 align:start position:0%
not served in the National Guard try to
 
05:42:36.310 --> 05:42:36.320 align:start position:0%
tell us that we need to be defended we
 
05:42:38.628 --> 05:42:38.638 align:start position:0%
do not
 
05:42:40.350 --> 05:42:40.360 align:start position:0%
first and foremost i' like to say this
 
05:42:43.670 --> 05:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
is the National Guard is the operational
 
05:42:45.868 --> 05:42:45.878 align:start position:0%
Force the operational reserve of the
 
05:42:48.750 --> 05:42:48.760 align:start position:0%
United States Army and reserves the
 
05:42:50.910 --> 05:42:50.920 align:start position:0%
American Publican Congress does not want
 
05:42:53.948 --> 05:42:53.958 align:start position:0%
a large standing army therefore they've
 
05:42:56.750 --> 05:42:56.760 align:start position:0%
made us the combat Reserve that's why
 
05:43:02.110 --> 05:43:02.120 align:start position:0%
you see tanks himars hoarders airplanes
 
05:43:04.150 --> 05:43:04.160 align:start position:0%
in the National
 
05:43:07.110 --> 05:43:07.120 align:start position:0%
Guard so let's look at P's P's are
 
05:43:08.628 --> 05:43:08.638 align:start position:0%
International Guard base has the modern
 
05:43:10.230 --> 05:43:10.240 align:start position:0%
KC 46
 
05:43:12.190 --> 05:43:12.200 align:start position:0%
refueler as I told you earlier this
 
05:43:14.230 --> 05:43:14.240 align:start position:0%
morning we're one of 18 International
 
05:43:18.110 --> 05:43:18.120 align:start position:0%
Guard bases with a refueling Wing 17
 
05:43:21.750 --> 05:43:21.760 align:start position:0%
have the old Eisenhower uh era KC 135
 
05:43:23.430 --> 05:43:23.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is the only one with the
 
05:43:23.440 --> 05:43:24.670 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is the only one with the
KC

05:43:24.670 --> 05:43:24.680 align:start position:0%
KC
 
05:43:26.990 --> 05:43:27.000 align:start position:0%
46 so now let's talk about funding and
 
05:43:28.830 --> 05:43:28.840 align:start position:0%
how they're funding for these things you
 
05:43:33.990 --> 05:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
know um the federal government funds us
 
05:43:35.750 --> 05:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
to be the a combat reserve of the United
 
05:43:37.910 --> 05:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
States Army and Air Force that's why the
 
05:43:39.430 --> 05:43:39.440 align:start position:0%
federal government puts us and gives us
 
05:43:41.628 --> 05:43:41.638 align:start position:0%
training dollars so let's is still this
 
05:43:42.910 --> 05:43:42.920 align:start position:0%
budget thing where I heard a lot of
 
05:43:44.708 --> 05:43:44.718 align:start position:0%
different things and um comment about I
 
05:43:46.548 --> 05:43:46.558 align:start position:0%
don't believe it how much is it this and
 
05:43:49.468 --> 05:43:49.478 align:start position:0%
that so let me give you a couple facts
 
05:43:51.270 --> 05:43:51.280 align:start position:0%
when the state of New Hampshire
 
05:43:54.350 --> 05:43:54.360 align:start position:0%
activated in state active duty 15
 
05:43:56.190 --> 05:43:56.200 align:start position:0%
soldiers to go to the Southwest border
 
05:43:59.590 --> 05:43:59.600 align:start position:0%
for 60 days the paying allowance and
 
05:44:03.270 --> 05:44:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:05.990 --> 05:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
$600,000 there's 2,800 service members
 
05:44:08.270 --> 05:44:08.280 align:start position:0%
in the New Hampshire National guard do
 
05:44:12.070 --> 05:44:12.080 align:start position:0%
the math the pay and salary for 2800
 
05:44:15.070 --> 05:44:15.080 align:start position:0%
service members from multiple ranks from
 
05:44:20.030 --> 05:44:20.040 align:start position:0%
private first class to myself is $200
 
05:44:22.150 --> 05:44:22.160 align:start position:0%
million the state of New Hampshire
 
05:44:24.070 --> 05:44:24.080 align:start position:0%
provides us with the state active duty
 
05:44:24.080 --> 05:44:26.110 align:start position:0%
provides us with the state active duty
account

05:44:26.110 --> 05:44:26.120 align:start position:0%
account
 
05:44:29.030 --> 05:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
$110,000 on an annual basis if we need
 
05:44:31.750 --> 05:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
to be activated in response to harms way
 
05:44:34.350 --> 05:44:34.360 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire so you
 
05:44:38.708 --> 05:44:38.718 align:start position:0%
have $200 million versus $10,000
 
05:44:41.548 --> 05:44:41.558 align:start position:0%
15 soldiers State active duty 60 days
 
05:44:43.628 --> 05:44:43.638 align:start position:0%
operation loone star Southwest border
 
05:44:46.430 --> 05:44:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:49.150 --> 05:44:49.160 align:start position:0%
$600,000 do the math and bring that out
 
05:44:50.590 --> 05:44:50.600 align:start position:0%
so they say hey Congress is going to
 
05:44:51.788 --> 05:44:51.798 align:start position:0%
take your money we're going to be in New
 
05:44:53.868 --> 05:44:53.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you all understand we're the
 
05:44:56.750 --> 05:44:56.760 align:start position:0%
fourth smallest National Guard per
 
05:44:58.830 --> 05:44:58.840 align:start position:0%
capita in the entire
 
05:45:00.948 --> 05:45:00.958 align:start position:0%
country with two Congressional members
 
05:45:03.270 --> 05:45:03.280 align:start position:0%
and two senators we are not New York we
 
05:45:05.390 --> 05:45:05.400 align:start position:0%
are not Texas we are not
 
05:45:08.030 --> 05:45:08.040 align:start position:0%
California he decided go first I would I
 
05:45:09.548 --> 05:45:09.558 align:start position:0%
would caution you with the the these
 
05:45:10.948 --> 05:45:10.958 align:start position:0%
anecdotes from the National Defense
 
05:45:12.868 --> 05:45:12.878 align:start position:0%
authorization act with Congress just
 
05:45:14.788 --> 05:45:14.798 align:start position:0%
passed this year think of these two
 
05:45:17.468 --> 05:45:17.478 align:start position:0%
little like this um
 
05:45:20.670 --> 05:45:20.680 align:start position:0%
vignettes first one is
 
05:45:23.150 --> 05:45:23.160 align:start position:0%
um everyone understands the space force
 
05:45:24.590 --> 05:45:24.600 align:start position:0%
was established approximately 5 six
 
05:45:26.670 --> 05:45:26.680 align:start position:0%
years ago and if you understand a little
 
05:45:28.230 --> 05:45:28.240 align:start position:0%
bit you know uh the National Guard were
 
05:45:31.708 --> 05:45:31.718 align:start position:0%
like a space National Guard why is that
 
05:45:34.910 --> 05:45:34.920 align:start position:0%
cuz seven states have Air National Guard
 
05:45:37.230 --> 05:45:37.240 align:start position:0%
units with a space mission which is
 
05:45:39.468 --> 05:45:39.478 align:start position:0%
equals 1100
 
05:45:41.788 --> 05:45:41.798 align:start position:0%
Airmen Congress just gave the
 
05:45:43.788 --> 05:45:43.798 align:start position:0%
authorization for the Secretary of the
 
05:45:46.830 --> 05:45:46.840 align:start position:0%
Air Force to take those units from those
 
05:45:49.990 --> 05:45:50.000 align:start position:0%
states without a Governor's
 
05:45:51.910 --> 05:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
consent so when you think you're going
 
05:45:53.510 --> 05:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
to tell the federal government that hey
 
05:45:54.910 --> 05:45:54.920 align:start position:0%
we don't want to play by your rules and
 
05:45:57.670 --> 05:45:57.680 align:start position:0%
we don't need your $395 million that's
 
05:46:01.190 --> 05:46:01.200 align:start position:0%
pay allowances equipment training
 
05:46:03.628 --> 05:46:03.638 align:start position:0%
infrastructure support you know that's
 
05:46:05.110 --> 05:46:05.120 align:start position:0%
what I would offer you too the second
 
05:46:06.910 --> 05:46:06.920 align:start position:0%
thing is um in addition to the example
 
05:46:08.830 --> 05:46:08.840 align:start position:0%
what the space National Guard is so
 
05:46:10.788 --> 05:46:10.798 align:start position:0%
generally speaking we are super proud of
 
05:46:12.788 --> 05:46:12.798 align:start position:0%
P's Air National Guard base and I told
 
05:46:14.310 --> 05:46:14.320 align:start position:0%
you many times we're the only Air
 
05:46:17.310 --> 05:46:17.320 align:start position:0%
National Guard wing with a KC 46
 
05:46:19.868 --> 05:46:19.878 align:start position:0%
refueler conceptually each state in the
 
05:46:22.110 --> 05:46:22.120 align:start position:0%
past has been given an air guard wing
 
05:46:23.590 --> 05:46:23.600 align:start position:0%
with a flying
 
05:46:27.310 --> 05:46:27.320 align:start position:0%
Mission over the last decade or two uh
 
05:46:29.830 --> 05:46:29.840 align:start position:0%
airplanes cost a lot of money every
 
05:46:31.830 --> 05:46:31.840 align:start position:0%
state now long no longer does has a
 
05:46:34.230 --> 05:46:34.240 align:start position:0%
flying Mission and in state are vying
 
05:46:37.670 --> 05:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
for that airplan or a flying mission
 
05:46:39.670 --> 05:46:39.680 align:start position:0%
again Congress in this past National
 
05:46:43.310 --> 05:46:43.320 align:start position:0%
Defense authorization act just gave the
 
05:46:46.670 --> 05:46:46.680 align:start position:0%
f-15s and the DC National Guard to the
 
05:46:49.390 --> 05:46:49.400 align:start position:0%
Maryland Air National Guard because
 
05:46:51.070 --> 05:46:51.080 align:start position:0%
Maryland lost their a10s because they're
 
05:46:51.080 --> 05:46:51.990 align:start position:0%
Maryland lost their a10s because they're
being

05:46:51.990 --> 05:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
being
 
05:46:54.110 --> 05:46:54.120 align:start position:0%
divested so if you don't think Congress
 
05:46:56.830 --> 05:46:56.840 align:start position:0%
will move equipment across state lines
 
05:46:58.628 --> 05:46:58.638 align:start position:0%
because the four small State's going to
 
05:47:00.868 --> 05:47:00.878 align:start position:0%
tell them we don't like your your
 
05:47:02.628 --> 05:47:02.638 align:start position:0%
interpretation of was that
 
05:47:04.548 --> 05:47:04.558 align:start position:0%
constitutional unconstitutional I would
 
05:47:07.030 --> 05:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
warrant you against that and my and my
 
05:47:08.670 --> 05:47:08.680 align:start position:0%
closing argument is how does the money
 
05:47:11.628 --> 05:47:11.638 align:start position:0%
work this is how the money Works our
 
05:47:13.150 --> 05:47:13.160 align:start position:0%
Congressional Delegation cannot defend
 
05:47:15.548 --> 05:47:15.558 align:start position:0%
our money Congress appropriates the
 
05:47:18.270 --> 05:47:18.280 align:start position:0%
money to the Department of Defense
 
05:47:19.990 --> 05:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Defense appropriates down
 
05:47:22.430 --> 05:47:22.440 align:start position:0%
to this uh National Guard Bureau that
 
05:47:24.628 --> 05:47:24.638 align:start position:0%
games it that appropriation to the Army
 
05:47:27.190 --> 05:47:27.200 align:start position:0%
and Air National Guard
 
05:47:29.868 --> 05:47:29.878 align:start position:0%
respectively why would I fund a National
 
05:47:33.670 --> 05:47:33.680 align:start position:0%
Guard who refuses to do its primary job
 
05:47:37.390 --> 05:47:37.400 align:start position:0%
which is to fight America's Wars
 
05:47:40.350 --> 05:47:40.360 align:start position:0%
that is all I have subject to your
 
05:47:42.510 --> 05:47:42.520 align:start position:0%
questions thank you General to your
 
05:47:45.510 --> 05:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
point that you just drill down on uh you
 
05:47:47.548 --> 05:47:47.558 align:start position:0%
explained that some assets were moved
 
05:47:50.350 --> 05:47:50.360 align:start position:0%
from one state from one guard to another
 
05:47:54.150 --> 05:47:54.160 align:start position:0%
uh due to uh that state not following
 
05:47:56.190 --> 05:47:56.200 align:start position:0%
expectations now an argument we heard
 
05:47:58.270 --> 05:47:58.280 align:start position:0%
last term we've heard today is that the
 
05:48:00.110 --> 05:48:00.120 align:start position:0%
uh we've been told that the we shouldn't
 
05:48:02.110 --> 05:48:02.120 align:start position:0%
worry about losing Federal funding that
 
05:48:04.190 --> 05:48:04.200 align:start position:0%
the that the feds would never dare to do
 
05:48:05.948 --> 05:48:05.958 align:start position:0%
that so you kind of just spoke to that
 
05:48:08.230 --> 05:48:08.240 align:start position:0%
but uh uh do you think there's there's
 
05:48:10.590 --> 05:48:10.600 align:start position:0%
some truth to to the notion that the
 
05:48:13.590 --> 05:48:13.600 align:start position:0%
fed's push comes to shove would not dare
 
05:48:13.600 --> 05:48:16.150 align:start position:0%
fed's push comes to shove would not dare
defund

05:48:16.150 --> 05:48:16.160 align:start position:0%
defund
 
05:48:18.670 --> 05:48:18.680 align:start position:0%
us why would they want to fund us when
 
05:48:20.830 --> 05:48:20.840 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't do our
 
05:48:23.788 --> 05:48:23.798 align:start position:0%
job our job is to be the combat Reserve
 
05:48:25.190 --> 05:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
United States Army and Air Force which
 
05:48:27.990 --> 05:48:28.000 align:start position:0%
is fight our nation's Wars regardless of
 
05:48:30.150 --> 05:48:30.160 align:start position:0%
how you think what War or conflict we
 
05:48:33.390 --> 05:48:33.400 align:start position:0%
are in that is not by decision right I
 
05:48:35.110 --> 05:48:35.120 align:start position:0%
follow the lawful orders of my
 
05:48:36.310 --> 05:48:36.320 align:start position:0%
commander-in-chief whether it's a
 
05:48:38.350 --> 05:48:38.360 align:start position:0%
governor or the president of this
 
05:48:42.910 --> 05:48:42.920 align:start position:0%
country so the we have himars we have
 
05:48:45.830 --> 05:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
refuelers we have Canon artillery what
 
05:48:48.468 --> 05:48:48.478 align:start position:0%
domestic emergency would we use that for
 
05:48:49.750 --> 05:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
what an argument with the Canadians if
 
05:48:52.390 --> 05:48:52.400 align:start position:0%
we lose a hockey
 
05:48:55.150 --> 05:48:55.160 align:start position:0%
game other questions representative
 
05:48:59.110 --> 05:48:59.120 align:start position:0%
menal bomb thank you Mr chairman so um a
 
05:49:01.708 --> 05:49:01.718 align:start position:0%
hypothe hypothetical situation for you
 
05:49:04.230 --> 05:49:04.240 align:start position:0%
so if New Hampshire were to pass such a
 
05:49:08.430 --> 05:49:08.440 align:start position:0%
bill and the and our National Guard
 
05:49:11.230 --> 05:49:11.240 align:start position:0%
would not be deployed overseas unless
 
05:49:14.270 --> 05:49:14.280 align:start position:0%
Congress passes a declaration of
 
05:49:18.590 --> 05:49:18.600 align:start position:0%
war if other states wanted to use some
 
05:49:20.788 --> 05:49:20.798 align:start position:0%
of our resources
 
05:49:24.230 --> 05:49:24.240 align:start position:0%
to go to a foreign state for instance if
 
05:49:27.190 --> 05:49:27.200 align:start position:0%
they were to use some of our refueling
 
05:49:29.510 --> 05:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
capabilities on the way overseas would
 
05:49:31.708 --> 05:49:31.718 align:start position:0%
this are do you know if this bill would
 
05:49:33.990 --> 05:49:34.000 align:start position:0%
prevent that so like preventing us from
 
05:49:37.750 --> 05:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
contributing in any way to
 
05:49:39.468 --> 05:49:39.478 align:start position:0%
uh ma'am if I understand it correctly I
 
05:49:42.628 --> 05:49:42.638 align:start position:0%
think the answer is yes okay um so think
 
05:49:46.548 --> 05:49:46.558 align:start position:0%
like this is my uh I would offer to you
 
05:49:47.910 --> 05:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
that this would close P their National
 
05:49:51.190 --> 05:49:51.200 align:start position:0%
Guard base okay wow thank you other
 
05:49:52.910 --> 05:49:52.920 align:start position:0%
questions represent
 
05:49:56.270 --> 05:49:56.280 align:start position:0%
Hemingway Major General mtis thank you
 
05:49:57.070 --> 05:49:57.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:50:00.350 --> 05:50:00.360 align:start position:0%
chair so as we go down here and and I
 
05:50:02.628 --> 05:50:02.638 align:start position:0%
know this kind of goes into your your
 
05:50:05.030 --> 05:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
background a little bit
 
05:50:09.270 --> 05:50:09.280 align:start position:0%
um Edward Coss Center how was that built
 
05:50:11.190 --> 05:50:11.200 align:start position:0%
100% federal
 
05:50:13.868 --> 05:50:13.878 align:start position:0%
funds um follow
 
05:50:17.628 --> 05:50:17.638 align:start position:0%
on so uh when we redid the uh the
 
05:50:20.708 --> 05:50:20.718 align:start position:0%
building one how was that funded uh 100%
 
05:50:23.310 --> 05:50:23.320 align:start position:0%
federal funds yeah we redil the redid
 
05:50:26.070 --> 05:50:26.080 align:start position:0%
the the airfield on in Manchester how
 
05:50:28.430 --> 05:50:28.440 align:start position:0%
was that fun uh 100% federal funds and
 
05:50:30.910 --> 05:50:30.920 align:start position:0%
so in your opinion if we were to go
 
05:50:33.230 --> 05:50:33.240 align:start position:0%
ahead and pass this bill do you think
 
05:50:35.510 --> 05:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
you would have the money for those
 
05:50:37.788 --> 05:50:37.798 align:start position:0%
buildings and that the time frame
 
05:50:41.390 --> 05:50:41.400 align:start position:0%
that no no
 
05:50:44.670 --> 05:50:44.680 align:start position:0%
uh one more followup
 
05:50:48.468 --> 05:50:48.478 align:start position:0%
Che the as I as I asked the other
 
05:50:51.468 --> 05:50:51.478 align:start position:0%
representative um what would be the
 
05:50:53.948 --> 05:50:53.958 align:start position:0%
mission of New Hampshire National Guard
 
05:50:55.628 --> 05:50:55.638 align:start position:0%
if we were to go ahead and pass this
 
05:50:57.868 --> 05:50:57.878 align:start position:0%
bill we wouldn't have a federal Mission
 
05:51:00.350 --> 05:51:00.360 align:start position:0%
and we would be so so think of it like
 
05:51:03.948 --> 05:51:03.958 align:start position:0%
this right um the federal government
 
05:51:07.230 --> 05:51:07.240 align:start position:0%
funds 100% of the salaries for the
 
05:51:09.030 --> 05:51:09.040 align:start position:0%
soldiers and Airmen in the New Hampshire
 
05:51:12.270 --> 05:51:12.280 align:start position:0%
National Guard the federal government
 
05:51:15.468 --> 05:51:15.478 align:start position:0%
funds either and there's a cost share
 
05:51:18.390 --> 05:51:18.400 align:start position:0%
100% of our maintenance facilities to
 
05:51:20.628 --> 05:51:20.638 align:start position:0%
maintain our helicopters and our wheeled
 
05:51:24.708 --> 05:51:24.718 align:start position:0%
Vehicles 100% of the aircraft adps and
 
05:51:26.708 --> 05:51:26.718 align:start position:0%
then there's a lower cost share for like
 
05:51:29.070 --> 05:51:29.080 align:start position:0%
our armories so an Armory those 18
 
05:51:31.510 --> 05:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
armories that we discussed earlier today
 
05:51:34.190 --> 05:51:34.200 align:start position:0%
they have a 5050 Federal general fund
 
05:51:37.468 --> 05:51:37.478 align:start position:0%
cost year I would offered to you you
 
05:51:39.310 --> 05:51:39.320 align:start position:0%
know when we say hey the fiscal note is
 
05:51:41.830 --> 05:51:41.840 align:start position:0%
vague because we can't sort of calculate
 
05:51:44.510 --> 05:51:44.520 align:start position:0%
the significant ramifications here the
 
05:51:47.150 --> 05:51:47.160 align:start position:0%
$55 million is really our operating
 
05:51:49.350 --> 05:51:49.360 align:start position:0%
budget so think of it like this our
 
05:51:50.868 --> 05:51:50.878 align:start position:0%
operating budget for this department is
 
05:51:54.628 --> 05:51:54.638 align:start position:0%
about 32 million Federal $7 million
 
05:51:57.190 --> 05:51:57.200 align:start position:0%
State our Capital appropriation is
 
05:51:59.270 --> 05:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
generally about an 8020 mix where we
 
05:52:00.868 --> 05:52:00.878 align:start position:0%
probably bringing about 30 to 40 million
 
05:52:02.430 --> 05:52:02.440 align:start position:0%
of federal dollars with about a $10
 
05:52:05.030 --> 05:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
million cost a state general fund cost
 
05:52:07.750 --> 05:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
share but all the equipment and to
 
05:52:10.830 --> 05:52:10.840 align:start position:0%
maintain it all the salaries are all
 
05:52:14.070 --> 05:52:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:17.390 --> 05:52:17.400 align:start position:0%
funded representative
 
05:52:19.430 --> 05:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
Gagney thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
05:52:22.590 --> 05:52:22.600 align:start position:0%
for taking my question talking about the
 
05:52:26.910 --> 05:52:26.920 align:start position:0%
money I imagine that you and your the
 
05:52:31.110 --> 05:52:31.120 align:start position:0%
people working with you um put bring
 
05:52:34.510 --> 05:52:34.520 align:start position:0%
forth a budget what you need right yes
 
05:52:35.430 --> 05:52:35.440 align:start position:0%
to the
 
05:52:39.468 --> 05:52:39.478 align:start position:0%
feds do you get 100% of what you ask for
 
05:52:40.948 --> 05:52:40.958 align:start position:0%
we're in a continuing resolution right
 
05:52:43.390 --> 05:52:43.400 align:start position:0%
now so uh we're in a continuing
 
05:52:45.948 --> 05:52:45.958 align:start position:0%
resolution right
 
05:52:48.868 --> 05:52:48.878 align:start position:0%
now there are significant um fiscal
 
05:52:51.150 --> 05:52:51.160 align:start position:0%
pressures on the federal budget we're
 
05:52:54.948 --> 05:52:54.958 align:start position:0%
generally given sufficient funds to pay
 
05:52:56.830 --> 05:52:56.840 align:start position:0%
our service members and operate the
 
05:53:04.468 --> 05:53:04.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:08.548 --> 05:53:08.558 align:start position:0%
us representative Buddha talki uh just a
 
05:53:08.558 --> 05:53:09.590 align:start position:0%
us representative Buddha talki uh just a
quick

05:53:09.590 --> 05:53:09.600 align:start position:0%
quick
 
05:53:14.868 --> 05:53:14.878 align:start position:0%
question so we had uh HB 55 just before
 
05:53:18.150 --> 05:53:18.160 align:start position:0%
and now we are talking about 104 SB 104
 
05:53:22.230 --> 05:53:22.240 align:start position:0%
FN uh Major General do you think that we
 
05:53:26.910 --> 05:53:26.920 align:start position:0%
are discussing how to dis disentangle or
 
05:53:28.628 --> 05:53:28.638 align:start position:0%
get away from the federal government or
 
05:53:37.150 --> 05:53:37.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:38.468 --> 05:53:38.478 align:start position:0%
that was a short
 
05:53:42.868 --> 05:53:42.878 align:start position:0%
answer other questions yes uh represent
 
05:53:46.868 --> 05:53:46.878 align:start position:0%
Jones thank you um thank you Mr chair
 
05:53:50.350 --> 05:53:50.360 align:start position:0%
and thank you gent for being here uh a
 
05:53:52.350 --> 05:53:52.360 align:start position:0%
recruiting based
 
05:53:55.670 --> 05:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
question why is it that certain people
 
05:53:57.910 --> 05:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
want the National Guard instead of going
 
05:54:02.310 --> 05:54:02.320 align:start position:0%
to another branch of the military uh I'm
 
05:54:05.910 --> 05:54:05.920 align:start position:0%
sure your recruiters are telling people
 
05:54:09.030 --> 05:54:09.040 align:start position:0%
certain things about I don't want to say
 
05:54:10.190 --> 05:54:10.200 align:start position:0%
too much
 
05:54:12.750 --> 05:54:12.760 align:start position:0%
about not having to go to war overseas
 
05:54:16.070 --> 05:54:16.080 align:start position:0%
and stuff like that uh and that's that's
 
05:54:18.750 --> 05:54:18.760 align:start position:0%
part of what they're looking for I think
 
05:54:22.670 --> 05:54:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:25.390 --> 05:54:25.400 align:start position:0%
mine so I would say this for like you
 
05:54:27.510 --> 05:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
know say why does a a young person man
 
05:54:29.468 --> 05:54:29.478 align:start position:0%
or woman want to join the National Guard
 
05:54:31.270 --> 05:54:31.280 align:start position:0%
I would generally say what we discussed
 
05:54:33.948 --> 05:54:33.958 align:start position:0%
earlier this morning was um a sense of
 
05:54:36.070 --> 05:54:36.080 align:start position:0%
purpose or service um something bigger
 
05:54:38.468 --> 05:54:38.478 align:start position:0%
than themselves and number two is those
 
05:54:38.478 --> 05:54:39.788 align:start position:0%
than themselves and number two is those
educational

05:54:39.788 --> 05:54:39.798 align:start position:0%
educational
 
05:54:42.390 --> 05:54:42.400 align:start position:0%
opportunities so a person can like so
 
05:54:43.788 --> 05:54:43.798 align:start position:0%
you know one of our lines is you can
 
05:54:46.548 --> 05:54:46.558 align:start position:0%
live lve and serve here in the state of
 
05:54:48.788 --> 05:54:48.798 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire right and the beauty of
 
05:54:51.990 --> 05:54:52.000 align:start position:0%
the National Guard is with the only only
 
05:54:55.070 --> 05:54:55.080 align:start position:0%
service with a dual mission right with a
 
05:54:56.230 --> 05:54:56.240 align:start position:0%
commander-in chief who's a governor of
 
05:54:58.270 --> 05:54:58.280 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire and obviously
 
05:55:00.070 --> 05:55:00.080 align:start position:0%
when called to title 10 active duty the
 
05:55:02.670 --> 05:55:02.680 align:start position:0%
president United States so you know our
 
05:55:04.948 --> 05:55:04.958 align:start position:0%
soldiers when they do search and rescues
 
05:55:06.510 --> 05:55:06.520 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire when we
 
05:55:09.150 --> 05:55:09.160 align:start position:0%
had almost 800 soldiers and well service
 
05:55:10.910 --> 05:55:10.920 align:start position:0%
members um supporting the state of New
 
05:55:13.868 --> 05:55:13.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire during Co people want to help
 
05:55:16.150 --> 05:55:16.160 align:start position:0%
their Community you know and that's what
 
05:55:20.350 --> 05:55:20.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:22.868 --> 05:55:22.878 align:start position:0%
state other
 
05:55:25.510 --> 05:55:25.520 align:start position:0%
questions representative Lloyd thank you
 
05:55:27.110 --> 05:55:27.120 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you for taking my
 
05:55:29.990 --> 05:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
question um currently as it stands right
 
05:55:33.350 --> 05:55:33.360 align:start position:0%
now if our um New Hampshire National
 
05:55:36.310 --> 05:55:36.320 align:start position:0%
Guard is called over to serve overseas
 
05:55:38.868 --> 05:55:38.878 align:start position:0%
or move overseas would the governor be
 
05:55:42.070 --> 05:55:42.080 align:start position:0%
able to say no we don't really want to
 
05:55:44.830 --> 05:55:44.840 align:start position:0%
send New Hampshire National Guard I I
 
05:55:46.030 --> 05:55:46.040 align:start position:0%
think we have a difference of opinion
 
05:55:47.708 --> 05:55:47.718 align:start position:0%
between the bill sponsor it's our
 
05:55:49.430 --> 05:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
opinion based upon us code that the
 
05:55:51.468 --> 05:55:51.478 align:start position:0%
governor does not have a say when you're
 
05:55:54.390 --> 05:55:54.400 align:start position:0%
activator on title 10 active duty the
 
05:55:56.548 --> 05:55:56.558 align:start position:0%
governor does not have a
 
05:55:59.788 --> 05:55:59.798 align:start position:0%
say other
 
05:56:02.390 --> 05:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
questions see thank you so much general
 
05:56:04.430 --> 05:56:04.440 align:start position:0%
for your testimony for being here today
 
05:56:07.110 --> 05:56:07.120 align:start position:0%
this morning and this in this afternoon
 
05:56:09.190 --> 05:56:09.200 align:start position:0%
I have nine more cards and we'll stay
 
05:56:11.110 --> 05:56:11.120 align:start position:0%
here as long as it takes for everyone
 
05:56:14.230 --> 05:56:14.240 align:start position:0%
toh say what they desire to say again I
 
05:56:16.190 --> 05:56:16.200 align:start position:0%
would just ask that you not uh spend a
 
05:56:18.548 --> 05:56:18.558 align:start position:0%
lot of time uh reiterating points that
 
05:56:21.070 --> 05:56:21.080 align:start position:0%
we've already heard uh next up is a
 
05:56:24.350 --> 05:56:24.360 align:start position:0%
former rep The Honorable John Graham who
 
05:56:26.948 --> 05:56:26.958 align:start position:0%
opposes the bill is uh the honorable Mr
 
05:56:32.270 --> 05:56:32.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:35.468 --> 05:56:35.478 align:start position:0%
back of the committee um for the record
 
05:56:37.628 --> 05:56:37.638 align:start position:0%
I am John and I live in
 
05:56:41.110 --> 05:56:41.120 align:start position:0%
Bedford and yes I did serve a couple of
 
05:56:45.190 --> 05:56:45.200 align:start position:0%
terms here um truth and lending I'm a
 
05:56:50.510 --> 05:56:50.520 align:start position:0%
retired army officer regular army and I
 
05:56:52.788 --> 05:56:52.798 align:start position:0%
just want to put a couple things into
 
05:56:55.510 --> 05:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
context when I first put on the army
 
05:56:58.390 --> 05:56:58.400 align:start position:0%
uniform NG stood for not
 
05:57:03.150 --> 05:57:03.160 align:start position:0%
going because at that time very very few
 
05:57:05.150 --> 05:57:05.160 align:start position:0%
National Guard units were called to
 
05:57:07.150 --> 05:57:07.160 align:start position:0%
active duty for
 
05:57:09.270 --> 05:57:09.280 align:start position:0%
Vietnam and let's just say that the
 
05:57:12.110 --> 05:57:12.120 align:start position:0%
guard did not have a recruiting problem
 
05:57:14.510 --> 05:57:14.520 align:start position:0%
back then because you weren't going to
 
05:57:16.110 --> 05:57:16.120 align:start position:0%
get drafted and you weren't going to be
 
05:57:17.310 --> 05:57:17.320 align:start position:0%
sent to
 
05:57:19.830 --> 05:57:19.840 align:start position:0%
Vietnam however with the end of that
 
05:57:22.310 --> 05:57:22.320 align:start position:0%
conflict and the virtually concurrent
 
05:57:26.270 --> 05:57:26.280 align:start position:0%
end of the draft a new Force structure
 
05:57:29.270 --> 05:57:29.280 align:start position:0%
Paradigm was
 
05:57:32.070 --> 05:57:32.080 align:start position:0%
developed with the rapid desizing
 
05:57:36.510 --> 05:57:36.520 align:start position:0%
downsizing the Army at that point um we
 
05:57:38.910 --> 05:57:38.920 align:start position:0%
developed what was called the total
 
05:57:41.310 --> 05:57:41.320 align:start position:0%
Force Under This
 
05:57:44.510 --> 05:57:44.520 align:start position:0%
restructuring some 70% of the combat
 
05:57:48.390 --> 05:57:48.400 align:start position:0%
service support units of the army things
 
05:57:50.948 --> 05:57:50.958 align:start position:0%
such as Medical Transportation
 
05:57:53.948 --> 05:57:53.958 align:start position:0%
maintenance supply were put into the
 
05:57:56.030 --> 05:57:56.040 align:start position:0%
reserve component of which the National
 
05:57:57.628 --> 05:57:57.638 align:start position:0%
Guard is
 
05:58:00.910 --> 05:58:00.920 align:start position:0%
part additionally it was understood that
 
05:58:03.590 --> 05:58:03.600 align:start position:0%
these units as well as the combat units
 
05:58:05.468 --> 05:58:05.478 align:start position:0%
and the guard would be deployed with the
 
05:58:09.430 --> 05:58:09.440 align:start position:0%
active forces during any crisis in the
 
05:58:11.830 --> 05:58:11.840 align:start position:0%
words of the army Chiefs of Staff Katon
 
05:58:14.110 --> 05:58:14.120 align:start position:0%
Abrams they are not going to take us to
 
05:58:17.230 --> 05:58:17.240 align:start position:0%
oreg again without calling up the
 
05:58:19.868 --> 05:58:19.878 align:start position:0%
reserves just a reminder that this type
 
05:58:19.878 --> 05:58:21.070 align:start position:0%
reserves just a reminder that this type
of

05:58:21.070 --> 05:58:21.080 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:58:25.150 --> 05:58:25.160 align:start position:0%
restructuring was possible only by AC of
 
05:58:29.310 --> 05:58:29.320 align:start position:0%
Congress and every defense budget every
 
05:58:32.190 --> 05:58:32.200 align:start position:0%
National Defense authorization act and
 
05:58:35.750 --> 05:58:35.760 align:start position:0%
every uh series of National Security and
 
05:58:39.230 --> 05:58:39.240 align:start position:0%
defense policies since that
 
05:58:42.590 --> 05:58:42.600 align:start position:0%
time have reiterate reiterated this
 
05:58:44.868 --> 05:58:44.878 align:start position:0%
total Force
 
05:58:47.390 --> 05:58:47.400 align:start position:0%
concept from a personal
 
05:58:49.788 --> 05:58:49.798 align:start position:0%
perspective I will say that as a theater
 
05:58:53.670 --> 05:58:53.680 align:start position:0%
level planner for de Desert Storm that c
 
05:58:55.670 --> 05:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
campaign would not have been possible
 
05:58:58.628 --> 05:58:58.638 align:start position:0%
without callup of National Guard
 
05:59:01.070 --> 05:59:01.080 align:start position:0%
units now let's just talk about the Dual
 
05:59:04.110 --> 05:59:04.120 align:start position:0%
nature I I know General mid's kind of
 
05:59:06.510 --> 05:59:06.520 align:start position:0%
touched on it he probably touched on it
 
05:59:06.520 --> 05:59:07.670 align:start position:0%
touched on it he probably touched on it
this

05:59:07.670 --> 05:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:59:10.628 --> 05:59:10.638 align:start position:0%
morning yes the governor is in command
 
05:59:12.990 --> 05:59:13.000 align:start position:0%
of Our National Guard in peace time and
 
05:59:15.350 --> 05:59:15.360 align:start position:0%
when it is activated for State
 
05:59:18.270 --> 05:59:18.280 align:start position:0%
emergency however once the president
 
05:59:20.788 --> 05:59:20.798 align:start position:0%
calls a guard unit to AC of service for
 
05:59:23.948 --> 05:59:23.958 align:start position:0%
whatever purpose inally known as
 
05:59:26.150 --> 05:59:26.160 align:start position:0%
federalization that unit becomes part of
 
05:59:28.948 --> 05:59:28.958 align:start position:0%
the active force and the governor has no
 
05:59:32.150 --> 05:59:32.160 align:start position:0%
authority over it let me say that again
 
05:59:35.070 --> 05:59:35.080 align:start position:0%
once called to active Federal service
 
05:59:37.868 --> 05:59:37.878 align:start position:0%
the governor has no authority over the
 
05:59:39.830 --> 05:59:39.840 align:start position:0%
guard units that are so
 
05:59:43.150 --> 05:59:43.160 align:start position:0%
activated thereby making this entire uh
 
05:59:45.468 --> 05:59:45.478 align:start position:0%
Bill moot since it's beyond the legal
 
05:59:48.628 --> 05:59:48.638 align:start position:0%
powers of the governor to deny um the
 
05:59:51.548 --> 05:59:51.558 align:start position:0%
deployment of those units that have been
 
05:59:55.110 --> 05:59:55.120 align:start position:0%
called active duty now we can argue at
 
05:59:58.070 --> 05:59:58.080 align:start position:0%
infinitum about whether or not Congress
 
06:00:01.150 --> 06:00:01.160 align:start position:0%
has abrogated its responsibility you
 
06:00:03.590 --> 06:00:03.600 align:start position:0%
know there have been court cases that
 
06:00:05.590 --> 06:00:05.600 align:start position:0%
were taken during the Vietnam war about
 
06:00:05.600 --> 06:00:06.468 align:start position:0%
were taken during the Vietnam war about
that

06:00:06.468 --> 06:00:06.478 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:00:10.070 --> 06:00:10.080 align:start position:0%
issue um and the only way the combat
 
06:00:13.070 --> 06:00:13.080 align:start position:0%
operations in Vietnam actually ended was
 
06:00:15.230 --> 06:00:15.240 align:start position:0%
Congress cut off funding for combat
 
06:00:18.510 --> 06:00:18.520 align:start position:0%
operations in Vietnam on a certain date
 
06:00:22.110 --> 06:00:22.120 align:start position:0%
so um they have done
 
06:00:25.310 --> 06:00:25.320 align:start position:0%
that and in conclusion I'd just like to
 
06:00:27.750 --> 06:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
say something Dick Cheney once remarked
 
06:00:29.670 --> 06:00:29.680 align:start position:0%
that to serve in the National Guard is
 
06:00:32.430 --> 06:00:32.440 align:start position:0%
to accept a dual Mission you can be
 
06:00:34.190 --> 06:00:34.200 align:start position:0%
called upon to defend the country
 
06:00:36.708 --> 06:00:36.718 align:start position:0%
against enemies abroad or to protect
 
06:00:38.750 --> 06:00:38.760 align:start position:0%
lives and property here at home in times
 
06:00:38.760 --> 06:00:39.708 align:start position:0%
lives and property here at home in times
of

06:00:39.708 --> 06:00:39.718 align:start position:0%
of
 
06:00:42.510 --> 06:00:42.520 align:start position:0%
emergency with all that in mind I would
 
06:00:44.510 --> 06:00:44.520 align:start position:0%
ask that you find this bill in expedient
 
06:00:46.670 --> 06:00:46.680 align:start position:0%
to legislate and if I was still on the
 
06:00:48.590 --> 06:00:48.600 align:start position:0%
floor of the house I would actually move
 
06:00:51.390 --> 06:00:51.400 align:start position:0%
indefinite postponement thank you Mr
 
06:00:54.030 --> 06:00:54.040 align:start position:0%
chairman would you take any questions
 
06:00:57.468 --> 06:00:57.478 align:start position:0%
I'll take them I may not answer
 
06:01:00.708 --> 06:01:00.718 align:start position:0%
them are there any
 
06:01:02.910 --> 06:01:02.920 align:start position:0%
questions uh having heard that you
 
06:01:05.430 --> 06:01:05.440 align:start position:0%
probably won't answer them there are no
 
06:01:07.990 --> 06:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
question you know me Mr chairman I would
 
06:01:09.830 --> 06:01:09.840 align:start position:0%
have answered them yeah of course
 
06:01:11.548 --> 06:01:11.558 align:start position:0%
welcome back good to see you and uh
 
06:01:15.270 --> 06:01:15.280 align:start position:0%

right Kevin Grady was here this morning
 
06:01:20.948 --> 06:01:20.958 align:start position:0%

advisory committee uh welcome back Mr
 
06:01:30.788 --> 06:01:30.798 align:start position:0%
Grady asked for seven minutes uh and he
 
06:01:32.788 --> 06:01:32.798 align:start position:0%
is oppos to the Bill thank you Mr
 
06:01:34.910 --> 06:01:34.920 align:start position:0%
chairman and in fact I could probably do
 
06:01:37.310 --> 06:01:37.320 align:start position:0%
it in less than seven minutes now that
 
06:01:40.030 --> 06:01:40.040 align:start position:0%
I've uh allowed General mtis and and Mr
 
06:01:41.430 --> 06:01:41.440 align:start position:0%
graah to go in front of me a lot of the
 
06:01:44.030 --> 06:01:44.040 align:start position:0%
things I might have told you uh they
 
06:01:46.310 --> 06:01:46.320 align:start position:0%
have already uh brought forth and I'm
 
06:01:48.070 --> 06:01:48.080 align:start position:0%
I'll just kind of gloss over them again
 
06:01:50.310 --> 06:01:50.320 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Kevin Grady I
 
06:01:53.030 --> 06:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
am a uh 25 year Air Force veteran and a
 
06:01:55.670 --> 06:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
27y year veteran of the town of hookit
 
06:01:57.590 --> 06:01:57.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and here I'm representing
 
06:01:59.110 --> 06:01:59.120 align:start position:0%
the state veterans advisory committee
 
06:02:01.230 --> 06:02:01.240 align:start position:0%
that we talk to you about uh this
 
06:02:04.310 --> 06:02:04.320 align:start position:0%
morning um we discussed this bill very
 
06:02:07.628 --> 06:02:07.638 align:start position:0%
briefly at our our meeting and to be
 
06:02:10.110 --> 06:02:10.120 align:start position:0%
honest we're we're so tired of this bill
 
06:02:13.110 --> 06:02:13.120 align:start position:0%
we could absolutely throw up okay we we
 
06:02:15.070 --> 06:02:15.080 align:start position:0%
opposed this bill in it in its different
 
06:02:19.310 --> 06:02:19.320 align:start position:0%
form as HB 580 in the 2021 session and
 
06:02:24.548 --> 06:02:24.558 align:start position:0%
the HB 1092 in the 2022 session we got
 
06:02:28.350 --> 06:02:28.360 align:start position:0%
to see HB 229 twice because it was held
 
06:02:30.708 --> 06:02:30.718 align:start position:0%
in this committee and then in the 23 uh
 
06:02:33.708 --> 06:02:33.718 align:start position:0%
22 session it was resurrected I'm sorry
 
06:02:36.910 --> 06:02:36.920 align:start position:0%
23 session was resurrected last fall and
 
06:02:39.990 --> 06:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
passed the house in January of last year
 
06:02:42.310 --> 06:02:42.320 align:start position:0%
and so and then it was retained in
 
06:02:44.350 --> 06:02:44.360 align:start position:0%
Committee in the Senate so this is a
 
06:02:46.110 --> 06:02:46.120 align:start position:0%
fifth year in a row that we've had to
 
06:02:48.708 --> 06:02:48.718 align:start position:0%
come and tell you why we don't support
 
06:02:48.718 --> 06:02:49.708 align:start position:0%
come and tell you why we don't support
this

06:02:49.708 --> 06:02:49.718 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:02:52.270 --> 06:02:52.280 align:start position:0%
legislation um first of all let me start
 
06:02:56.150 --> 06:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
by saying I don't doubt the sincerity of
 
06:02:58.910 --> 06:02:58.920 align:start position:0%
the sponsors of this bill of the people
 
06:03:01.030 --> 06:03:01.040 align:start position:0%
who you've listened to today talk to you
 
06:03:03.510 --> 06:03:03.520 align:start position:0%
about their experiences okay I've have
 
06:03:05.948 --> 06:03:05.958 align:start position:0%
no doubt that these people who have been
 
06:03:08.270 --> 06:03:08.280 align:start position:0%
to combat on the ground have seen things
 
06:03:11.390 --> 06:03:11.400 align:start position:0%
that no person should ever have to see
 
06:03:15.150 --> 06:03:15.160 align:start position:0%
okay I we don't doubt that at all okay
 
06:03:18.190 --> 06:03:18.200 align:start position:0%
but we do take a few exceptions here the
 
06:03:20.390 --> 06:03:20.400 align:start position:0%
first and it's been sort of walked over
 
06:03:21.990 --> 06:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
a little bit about how Congress hasn't
 
06:03:24.910 --> 06:03:24.920 align:start position:0%
declared war since 1942 and the two
 
06:03:27.788 --> 06:03:27.798 align:start position:0%
other places were Bulgaria and Hungary
 
06:03:30.150 --> 06:03:30.160 align:start position:0%
as well as Romania we were just clean in
 
06:03:32.270 --> 06:03:32.280 align:start position:0%
fourth of June of '92 uh 42 we were
 
06:03:33.868 --> 06:03:33.878 align:start position:0%
cleaning up the people that had declared
 
06:03:35.990 --> 06:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
war on us and we had declared war back
 
06:03:38.030 --> 06:03:38.040 align:start position:0%
on them but I don't I think that it
 
06:03:39.390 --> 06:03:39.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean they haven't exercised
 
06:03:42.190 --> 06:03:42.200 align:start position:0%
their Authority okay as Mr Graham told
 
06:03:43.910 --> 06:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
you you know Vietnam pretty much stopped
 
06:03:46.150 --> 06:03:46.160 align:start position:0%
because the Congress C the money off and
 
06:03:48.270 --> 06:03:48.280 align:start position:0%
and Congress had passed the tonen Gulf
 
06:03:49.788 --> 06:03:49.798 align:start position:0%
resolution which chairman Moffett
 
06:03:52.270 --> 06:03:52.280 align:start position:0%
alluded to earlier in 1964 which
 
06:03:54.110 --> 06:03:54.120 align:start position:0%
essentially gave the president a blank
 
06:03:56.468 --> 06:03:56.478 align:start position:0%
check do what you want go ahead ramp the
 
06:03:59.390 --> 06:03:59.400 align:start position:0%
war up we don't care okay at the end of
 
06:04:02.190 --> 06:04:02.200 align:start position:0%
the war the Congress said man that was a
 
06:04:04.830 --> 06:04:04.840 align:start position:0%
bad idea holy crap that was a bad idea
 
06:04:07.310 --> 06:04:07.320 align:start position:0%
so they pass War Powers Act it
 
06:04:09.070 --> 06:04:09.080 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly in the house
 
06:04:11.230 --> 06:04:11.240 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly in the Senate it went to
 
06:04:12.910 --> 06:04:12.920 align:start position:0%
President Nixon's desk and he promptly
 
06:04:15.628 --> 06:04:15.638 align:start position:0%
vetoed it and they said watch this and
 
06:04:17.628 --> 06:04:17.638 align:start position:0%
they overrode a presidential veto and it
 
06:04:19.150 --> 06:04:19.160 align:start position:0%
became the law of the land does that
 
06:04:20.788 --> 06:04:20.798 align:start position:0%
sound to you like they're abating their
 
06:04:24.070 --> 06:04:24.080 align:start position:0%
War fighting Powers doesn't to me okay
 
06:04:27.830 --> 06:04:27.840 align:start position:0%
and I we think that the the evolution of
 
06:04:29.430 --> 06:04:29.440 align:start position:0%
the authorization for the use of
 
06:04:33.390 --> 06:04:33.400 align:start position:0%
military force concept it of course it
 
06:04:36.270 --> 06:04:36.280 align:start position:0%
came out of that that bill because you
 
06:04:38.628 --> 06:04:38.638 align:start position:0%
have 60 days you have to notify Congress
 
06:04:41.350 --> 06:04:41.360 align:start position:0%
within 48 hours and you have 60 days to
 
06:04:43.110 --> 06:04:43.120 align:start position:0%
do things with a 20 a 30-day
 
06:04:45.390 --> 06:04:45.400 align:start position:0%
redeployment period otherwise we cut the
 
06:04:47.548 --> 06:04:47.558 align:start position:0%
money off that's essentially what that
 
06:04:50.830 --> 06:04:50.840 align:start position:0%
that bill says and so if you if you
 
06:04:54.310 --> 06:04:54.320 align:start position:0%
think about how George HW Bush before
 
06:04:56.070 --> 06:04:56.080 align:start position:0%
what became Desert Storm went and got an
 
06:04:58.190 --> 06:04:58.200 align:start position:0%
authorization for the use of force why
 
06:05:00.910 --> 06:05:00.920 align:start position:0%
it's required to by the warw resolution
 
06:05:03.310 --> 06:05:03.320 align:start position:0%
okay same song separate verse President
 
06:05:05.788 --> 06:05:05.798 align:start position:0%
George W bush for operations in
 
06:05:08.030 --> 06:05:08.040 align:start position:0%
Afghanistan and then later into Iraq
 
06:05:09.510 --> 06:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
they're required to get this
 
06:05:12.750 --> 06:05:12.760 align:start position:0%
authorization and congress's use of the
 
06:05:16.788 --> 06:05:16.798 align:start position:0%
aumf in our opinion is an evolution of
 
06:05:19.948 --> 06:05:19.958 align:start position:0%
the war making powers of the Congress it
 
06:05:23.990 --> 06:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
is a a rep it is a recognition of the
 
06:05:26.830 --> 06:05:26.840 align:start position:0%
fact that the founding fathers would not
 
06:05:28.910 --> 06:05:28.920 align:start position:0%
recognize what the world looks like
 
06:05:32.230 --> 06:05:32.240 align:start position:0%
today airplanes aircraft carriers stuff
 
06:05:35.628 --> 06:05:35.638 align:start position:0%
happening in Space the US is has argued
 
06:05:37.510 --> 06:05:37.520 align:start position:0%
Ubly the economic superpower of the
 
06:05:38.910 --> 06:05:38.920 align:start position:0%
world and probably the military
 
06:05:40.510 --> 06:05:40.520 align:start position:0%
superpower of the world as well in terms
 
06:05:42.708 --> 06:05:42.718 align:start position:0%
of capabilities okay they would never
 
06:05:45.548 --> 06:05:45.558 align:start position:0%
have recognized this place so back in
 
06:05:48.030 --> 06:05:48.040 align:start position:0%
the 1940s when we had to do things like
 
06:05:49.830 --> 06:05:49.840 align:start position:0%
draft people when we had to do things
 
06:05:52.350 --> 06:05:52.360 align:start position:0%
like like like rations and we had to do
 
06:05:54.150 --> 06:05:54.160 align:start position:0%
things like I know your factory wants to
 
06:05:55.510 --> 06:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
make this but we need you to make this
 
06:05:57.150 --> 06:05:57.160 align:start position:0%
for the war effort we don't have to do
 
06:06:00.350 --> 06:06:00.360 align:start position:0%
any of that anymore to to to we don't
 
06:06:02.868 --> 06:06:02.878 align:start position:0%
have to do any of that anymore to uh
 
06:06:04.868 --> 06:06:04.878 align:start position:0%
make sure that our interests are
 
06:06:07.430 --> 06:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
protected where ever we think that they
 
06:06:09.868 --> 06:06:09.878 align:start position:0%
need to be protected now we've listened
 
06:06:11.788 --> 06:06:11.798 align:start position:0%
to a lot of different article you know
 
06:06:14.190 --> 06:06:14.200 align:start position:0%
things about at the Congress they're
 
06:06:15.590 --> 06:06:15.600 align:start position:0%
they're doing this they're doing that
 
06:06:17.670 --> 06:06:17.680 align:start position:0%
yes and it's all at the Congressional
 
06:06:19.350 --> 06:06:19.360 align:start position:0%
level between the Congress and the
 
06:06:22.270 --> 06:06:22.280 align:start position:0%
president we are not going to solve this
 
06:06:24.070 --> 06:06:24.080 align:start position:0%
problem from around this table in New
 
06:06:26.230 --> 06:06:26.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm sorry we're not it's just
 
06:06:28.670 --> 06:06:28.680 align:start position:0%
not going to happen Okay when I was in
 
06:06:31.310 --> 06:06:31.320 align:start position:0%
the Air Force back in the dawn of time
 
06:06:33.270 --> 06:06:33.280 align:start position:0%
the National Guard got the airplanes
 
06:06:35.190 --> 06:06:35.200 align:start position:0%
that the Air Force was all done with and
 
06:06:37.350 --> 06:06:37.360 align:start position:0%
didn't want fly anymore and they they
 
06:06:39.030 --> 06:06:39.040 align:start position:0%
did great work with them and they lasted
 
06:06:42.628 --> 06:06:42.638 align:start position:0%
a long time now look around you KC 46 is
 
06:06:45.150 --> 06:06:45.160 align:start position:0%
at at at peas there are captains All
 
06:06:47.150 --> 06:06:47.160 align:start position:0%
Over The Air Force flying an airplane
 
06:06:48.910 --> 06:06:48.920 align:start position:0%
that's older than their grandparents in
 
06:06:51.548 --> 06:06:51.558 align:start position:0%
the KC 135 okay they would love to be
 
06:06:54.310 --> 06:06:54.320 align:start position:0%
flying that airplane but we have it here
 
06:06:56.150 --> 06:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
okay next door in Vermont there are
 
06:06:57.910 --> 06:06:57.920 align:start position:0%
captains flying f-16s that want to fly
 
06:07:01.030 --> 06:07:01.040 align:start position:0%
the F35 we've got f35s in Vermont in the
 
06:07:03.590 --> 06:07:03.600 align:start position:0%
guard okay when we downsized after
 
06:07:06.628 --> 06:07:06.638 align:start position:0%
Desert Storm and and and and Mr Graham
 
06:07:09.468 --> 06:07:09.478 align:start position:0%
alluded to this total Force concept we
 
06:07:11.910 --> 06:07:11.920 align:start position:0%
basically said we're going to transfer a
 
06:07:14.350 --> 06:07:14.360 align:start position:0%
lot of the really great capabilities we
 
06:07:16.830 --> 06:07:16.840 align:start position:0%
have to the guard so the guard is not
 
06:07:20.230 --> 06:07:20.240 align:start position:0%
now not a nice to have anymore if it
 
06:07:22.948 --> 06:07:22.958 align:start position:0%
ever was it's a must have we have to
 
06:07:26.788 --> 06:07:26.798 align:start position:0%
have our guard forces okay
 
06:07:29.510 --> 06:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
but our guard forces have to be
 
06:07:32.270 --> 06:07:32.280 align:start position:0%
available to us okay if we need these
 
06:07:34.430 --> 06:07:34.440 align:start position:0%
forces we at the national command
 
06:07:36.590 --> 06:07:36.600 align:start position:0%
Authority level need to be able to get
 
06:07:38.510 --> 06:07:38.520 align:start position:0%
them and the way we get them is we
 
06:07:42.110 --> 06:07:42.120 align:start position:0%
activate them via title 10 so the so if
 
06:07:44.910 --> 06:07:44.920 align:start position:0%
you were to pass this legislation okay
 
06:07:47.150 --> 06:07:47.160 align:start position:0%
and and the national command Authority
 
06:07:50.190 --> 06:07:50.200 align:start position:0%
said we need these guys what likely
 
06:07:51.788 --> 06:07:51.798 align:start position:0%
would happen would be they just activate
 
06:07:53.708 --> 06:07:53.718 align:start position:0%
them and when you said hey hey hey you
 
06:07:56.190 --> 06:07:56.200 align:start position:0%
can't do that well what forces are you
 
06:07:57.750 --> 06:07:57.760 align:start position:0%
talking about we activated those those
 
06:07:59.310 --> 06:07:59.320 align:start position:0%
are active duty forces now they belong
 
06:08:01.270 --> 06:08:01.280 align:start position:0%
to me if they ever belong to you to
 
06:08:04.150 --> 06:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
begin with okay they belong to us now
 
06:08:06.350 --> 06:08:06.360 align:start position:0%
the guard in New Hampshire is a double
 
06:08:07.948 --> 06:08:07.958 align:start position:0%
bonus for every single one of you in
 
06:08:10.070 --> 06:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
this room it's a great bonus for you as
 
06:08:12.350 --> 06:08:12.360 align:start position:0%
a as a taxpayer that we have this
 
06:08:14.948 --> 06:08:14.958 align:start position:0%
capability here but it's also a bonus in
 
06:08:17.830 --> 06:08:17.840 align:start position:0%
that when we have a guard in our state
 
06:08:20.510 --> 06:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
we can do things like man a covid
 
06:08:23.310 --> 06:08:23.320 align:start position:0%
vaccination site if we need to we can
 
06:08:25.628 --> 06:08:25.638 align:start position:0%
have helicopters go and pluck people off
 
06:08:27.270 --> 06:08:27.280 align:start position:0%
of the side of mountains that shouldn't
 
06:08:29.468 --> 06:08:29.478 align:start position:0%
be there right you have a search at
 
06:08:31.030 --> 06:08:31.040 align:start position:0%
Rescue Mission and you can do an actual
 
06:08:33.270 --> 06:08:33.280 align:start position:0%
search and rescue boy the government
 
06:08:36.110 --> 06:08:36.120 align:start position:0%
will pay for that all day long
 
06:08:37.948 --> 06:08:37.958 align:start position:0%
the the general already talked about
 
06:08:40.390 --> 06:08:40.400 align:start position:0%
what exactly how the money works you
 
06:08:42.868 --> 06:08:42.878 align:start position:0%
know the the truth is you probably
 
06:08:45.548 --> 06:08:45.558 align:start position:0%
wouldn't see if you were to pass this
 
06:08:47.548 --> 06:08:47.558 align:start position:0%
legislation you wouldn't see anything
 
06:08:50.190 --> 06:08:50.200 align:start position:0%
right away because it costs money to to
 
06:08:53.070 --> 06:08:53.080 align:start position:0%
move forces but uh as the general said
 
06:08:55.430 --> 06:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
you know if you start to see a KC 46
 
06:08:57.670 --> 06:08:57.680 align:start position:0%
size hanger going in at Cape cot or
 
06:09:00.190 --> 06:09:00.200 align:start position:0%
Portland you can see that handwriting on
 
06:09:02.750 --> 06:09:02.760 align:start position:0%
the wall okay and that Congress doesn't
 
06:09:04.708 --> 06:09:04.718 align:start position:0%
really have once it gets down to the
 
06:09:06.350 --> 06:09:06.360 align:start position:0%
National Guard level doesn't really have
 
06:09:08.510 --> 06:09:08.520 align:start position:0%
a lot to say in the matter they just
 
06:09:10.948 --> 06:09:10.958 align:start position:0%
don't um
 
06:09:14.350 --> 06:09:14.360 align:start position:0%
so the complaint if there is one here is
 
06:09:16.670 --> 06:09:16.680 align:start position:0%
with the Congress and the president it
 
06:09:18.150 --> 06:09:18.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't really have anything to do with
 
06:09:20.628 --> 06:09:20.638 align:start position:0%
our National Guard and this bill is not
 
06:09:22.708 --> 06:09:22.718 align:start position:0%
going to defend our guard it's just not
 
06:09:26.110 --> 06:09:26.120 align:start position:0%
going to okay uh it's it's going to put
 
06:09:28.750 --> 06:09:28.760 align:start position:0%
us in a rather precarious position and
 
06:09:32.830 --> 06:09:32.840 align:start position:0%
and it it also you know it
 
06:09:35.390 --> 06:09:35.400 align:start position:0%
essentially the way this works and and
 
06:09:36.708 --> 06:09:36.718 align:start position:0%
General the general molit has already
 
06:09:38.670 --> 06:09:38.680 align:start position:0%
said to you that the governor doesn't
 
06:09:41.628 --> 06:09:41.638 align:start position:0%
get a say okay when when forces are
 
06:09:44.548 --> 06:09:44.558 align:start position:0%
activated using title 10 the governor
 
06:09:46.430 --> 06:09:46.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't get a say he can't complain
 
06:09:48.910 --> 06:09:48.920 align:start position:0%
about where where they want to go that's
 
06:09:51.390 --> 06:09:51.400 align:start position:0%
the federal law you want to take that to
 
06:09:54.350 --> 06:09:54.360 align:start position:0%
court the judge the the first thing a
 
06:09:55.788 --> 06:09:55.798 align:start position:0%
judge is going to say is this is a
 
06:09:57.788 --> 06:09:57.798 align:start position:0%
federal law this is your state law right
 
06:09:59.468 --> 06:09:59.478 align:start position:0%
we still have a supremacy clause in the
 
06:10:02.548 --> 06:10:02.558 align:start position:0%
Constitution right okay I we're done
 
06:10:02.558 --> 06:10:04.150 align:start position:0%
Constitution right okay I we're done
here

06:10:04.150 --> 06:10:04.160 align:start position:0%
here
 
06:10:07.230 --> 06:10:07.240 align:start position:0%
so it the important thing here is we're
 
06:10:08.788 --> 06:10:08.798 align:start position:0%
not going to solve this problem from
 
06:10:12.430 --> 06:10:12.440 align:start position:0%
here this this is legislation that um I
 
06:10:14.990 --> 06:10:15.000 align:start position:0%
agree with Mr Graham you know if there's
 
06:10:16.670 --> 06:10:16.680 align:start position:0%
a way for you to vote this thing off the
 
06:10:18.468 --> 06:10:18.478 align:start position:0%
island permanently we would love to see
 
06:10:21.548 --> 06:10:21.558 align:start position:0%
it subject to your questions that's all
 
06:10:25.030 --> 06:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
I have today are there any
 
06:10:27.230 --> 06:10:27.240 align:start position:0%
questions uh representative Mandel bum
 
06:10:29.270 --> 06:10:29.280 align:start position:0%
and then representative Lloyd thank you
 
06:10:32.230 --> 06:10:32.240 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman so
 
06:10:36.590 --> 06:10:36.600 align:start position:0%
um would you kind of character
 
06:10:40.270 --> 06:10:40.280 align:start position:0%
um the the aumf
 
06:10:44.110 --> 06:10:44.120 align:start position:0%
as like adapting or the National Guard
 
06:10:45.390 --> 06:10:45.400 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I'm trying to figure out how
 
06:10:47.390 --> 06:10:47.400 align:start position:0%
to phrase
 
06:10:54.030 --> 06:10:54.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:56.750 --> 06:10:56.760 align:start position:0%
um based around kind of the national or
 
06:10:58.830 --> 06:10:58.840 align:start position:0%
the progression of the National Guard
 
06:11:02.190 --> 06:11:02.200 align:start position:0%
over history from you know mostly being
 
06:11:03.990 --> 06:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
ready I mean it obviously is ready to
 
06:11:07.868 --> 06:11:07.878 align:start position:0%
deploy but um um for active you know War
 
06:11:10.430 --> 06:11:10.440 align:start position:0%
versus I I I think the aumf has less to
 
06:11:13.150 --> 06:11:13.160 align:start position:0%
do with the guard it has more to do with
 
06:11:15.270 --> 06:11:15.280 align:start position:0%
with active duty forces and things like
 
06:11:18.548 --> 06:11:18.558 align:start position:0%
that the problem that you have and and
 
06:11:20.190 --> 06:11:20.200 align:start position:0%
what you see especially you'll hear
 
06:11:22.070 --> 06:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
these cases like for example there were
 
06:11:24.468 --> 06:11:24.478 align:start position:0%
a lot of guard units uh from from
 
06:11:27.910 --> 06:11:27.920 align:start position:0%
Louisiana area who were deployed
 
06:11:31.190 --> 06:11:31.200 align:start position:0%
overseas during a hurricane Katrina and
 
06:11:32.350 --> 06:11:32.360 align:start position:0%
so there were a lot of folks that were
 
06:11:33.788 --> 06:11:33.798 align:start position:0%
very upset about the fact that these
 
06:11:35.750 --> 06:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
guys weren't at home and where they
 
06:11:37.030 --> 06:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
where they thought that they needed to
 
06:11:38.990 --> 06:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
be well they were doing their their
 
06:11:41.750 --> 06:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
their wartime Mission uh over in Iraq at
 
06:11:43.390 --> 06:11:43.400 align:start position:0%
the time Building Bridges and doing
 
06:11:44.590 --> 06:11:44.600 align:start position:0%
other things that they were doing over
 
06:11:46.310 --> 06:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
there because that's what their company
 
06:11:49.310 --> 06:11:49.320 align:start position:0%
specialized in now that said all you
 
06:11:51.110 --> 06:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
have to do is sort of look at the at the
 
06:11:54.110 --> 06:11:54.120 align:start position:0%
history and what you would see is that
 
06:11:57.788 --> 06:11:57.798 align:start position:0%
we invaded Iraq in the spring of
 
06:12:01.830 --> 06:12:01.840 align:start position:0%
2003 okay Katrina was in August of 2004
 
06:12:05.230 --> 06:12:05.240 align:start position:0%
by the by the time that you got to 200
 
06:12:07.910 --> 06:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
the summer of 2004 every active duty
 
06:12:09.628 --> 06:12:09.638 align:start position:0%
unit and their brother had been there at
 
06:12:11.708 --> 06:12:11.718 align:start position:0%
least once and maybe twice so now it's
 
06:12:13.310 --> 06:12:13.320 align:start position:0%
going to be the guard's turn to pick up
 
06:12:16.708 --> 06:12:16.718 align:start position:0%
in that rotation and it's not like and
 
06:12:18.510 --> 06:12:18.520 align:start position:0%
general mtis would tell you this it's
 
06:12:20.708 --> 06:12:20.718 align:start position:0%
not like we don't know when our forces
 
06:12:22.310 --> 06:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
are going to be activated to go do a
 
06:12:24.270 --> 06:12:24.280 align:start position:0%
federal Mission we know that the folks
 
06:12:26.350 --> 06:12:26.360 align:start position:0%
that are over there in in h the Middle
 
06:12:27.990 --> 06:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
East I'm sure we've known about those
 
06:12:30.590 --> 06:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
guys for at least a year or 18 months so
 
06:12:33.150 --> 06:12:33.160 align:start position:0%
it's not like it's a big surprise
 
06:12:37.628 --> 06:12:37.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:39.670 --> 06:12:39.680 align:start position:0%
representative Lloyd thank you Mr
 
06:12:41.548 --> 06:12:41.558 align:start position:0%
chairman um and thank you for taking my
 
06:12:44.788 --> 06:12:44.798 align:start position:0%
question so if we theoretically if we
 
06:12:48.350 --> 06:12:48.360 align:start position:0%
lost equipment funding resources uh from
 
06:12:50.708 --> 06:12:50.718 align:start position:0%
the federal level what impact do you
 
06:12:53.708 --> 06:12:53.718 align:start position:0%
foresee this having on Veterans Services
 
06:12:53.718 --> 06:12:55.868 align:start position:0%
foresee this having on Veterans Services
in

06:12:55.868 --> 06:12:55.878 align:start position:0%
in
 
06:12:57.868 --> 06:12:57.878 align:start position:0%
particular that's that's a hard one to
 
06:13:01.310 --> 06:13:01.320 align:start position:0%
measure because the with with the the
 
06:13:03.310 --> 06:13:03.320 align:start position:0%
authorizations for essentially all of
 
06:13:06.070 --> 06:13:06.080 align:start position:0%
davs are are being paid paid right now
 
06:13:08.510 --> 06:13:08.520 align:start position:0%
you know uh helped out by the federal
 
06:13:10.468 --> 06:13:10.478 align:start position:0%
government so that's that's a that's a a
 
06:13:12.150 --> 06:13:12.160 align:start position:0%
tough question for me to answer probably
 
06:13:14.510 --> 06:13:14.520 align:start position:0%
might be easier for for uh the general
 
06:13:19.070 --> 06:13:19.080 align:start position:0%
to to answer that question but um the
 
06:13:21.270 --> 06:13:21.280 align:start position:0%
the idea of losing the services would be
 
06:13:22.548 --> 06:13:22.558 align:start position:0%
you know if you're if you're the
 
06:13:25.590 --> 06:13:25.600 align:start position:0%
Secretary of Defense okay and I've got
 
06:13:27.628 --> 06:13:27.638 align:start position:0%
Reserve forces but I can't use them why
 
06:13:29.708 --> 06:13:29.718 align:start position:0%
are they in the reserves why don't I
 
06:13:30.948 --> 06:13:30.958 align:start position:0%
just pull them back and make them part
 
06:13:33.830 --> 06:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
of the active force or why don't I move
 
06:13:35.350 --> 06:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
them to a state that's going to that's
 
06:13:36.750 --> 06:13:36.760 align:start position:0%
going to follow the
 
06:13:39.190 --> 06:13:39.200 align:start position:0%
rules that's that that's the attitude
 
06:13:41.110 --> 06:13:41.120 align:start position:0%
you're going to deal with if you pass
 
06:13:43.510 --> 06:13:43.520 align:start position:0%
this legislation up the channel towards
 
06:13:45.350 --> 06:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
the Guard Bureau that's the attitude
 
06:13:47.868 --> 06:13:47.878 align:start position:0%
you're going to deal
 
06:13:51.270 --> 06:13:51.280 align:start position:0%
with ma'am specifically um generally no
 
06:13:53.868 --> 06:13:53.878 align:start position:0%
impact so the veteran service portfolio
 
06:13:56.270 --> 06:13:56.280 align:start position:0%
is 100% generally funded for the 990,000
 
06:13:58.150 --> 06:13:58.160 align:start position:0%
veterans in the state of New Hampshire
 
06:13:59.788 --> 06:13:59.798 align:start position:0%
what could be impacted is the
 
06:14:02.190 --> 06:14:02.200 align:start position:0%
collaboration of the military
 
06:14:04.350 --> 06:14:04.360 align:start position:0%
resources that we have for our service
 
06:14:07.070 --> 06:14:07.080 align:start position:0%
members because we do a lot of like just
 
06:14:09.590 --> 06:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
collaboration amongst you know the guard
 
06:14:11.510 --> 06:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
the military the veterans to say hey
 
06:14:13.670 --> 06:14:13.680 align:start position:0%
where there's efficiencies in economy of
 
06:14:15.868 --> 06:14:15.878 align:start position:0%
scale thank you very
 
06:14:20.350 --> 06:14:20.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:22.548 --> 06:14:22.558 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Mr Grady thanks for

there we
 
06:14:41.190 --> 06:14:41.200 align:start position:0%
go hello again thank you all for
 
06:14:43.230 --> 06:14:43.240 align:start position:0%
conducting this public hearing my name
 
06:14:45.708 --> 06:14:45.718 align:start position:0%
is Eric brei I'm a resident of Dover New
 
06:14:47.788 --> 06:14:47.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as I previously stated in the
 
06:14:50.788 --> 06:14:50.798 align:start position:0%
last hearing I served uh three terms in
 
06:14:52.628 --> 06:14:52.638 align:start position:0%
the main State Senate before I recently
 
06:14:54.070 --> 06:14:54.080 align:start position:0%
made the move to the LI for your die
 
06:14:57.868 --> 06:14:57.878 align:start position:0%
state where I'm happy to be uh now and
 
06:14:59.990 --> 06:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
um I will mention as well that uh during
 
06:15:03.070 --> 06:15:03.080 align:start position:0%
my last term in the main Senate to uh
 
06:15:05.468 --> 06:15:05.478 align:start position:0%
the the most recent past legisl I was
 
06:15:07.190 --> 06:15:07.200 align:start position:0%
the bill sponsor for this very
 
06:15:11.270 --> 06:15:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:13.990 --> 06:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
Maine so I previously mention I'm a big
 
06:15:16.548 --> 06:15:16.558 align:start position:0%
fan of Daniel Webster and it was nice to
 
06:15:19.708 --> 06:15:19.718 align:start position:0%
walk into um this building today it's
 
06:15:22.150 --> 06:15:22.160 align:start position:0%
actually my very first time
 
06:15:23.468 --> 06:15:23.478 align:start position:0%
participating in a public hearing here
 
06:15:24.948 --> 06:15:24.958 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and it was nice to see
 
06:15:27.868 --> 06:15:27.878 align:start position:0%
that statue to Daniel Webster out
 
06:15:30.510 --> 06:15:30.520 align:start position:0%
front and as I think about Daniel
 
06:15:33.390 --> 06:15:33.400 align:start position:0%
Webster and I think about this
 
06:15:35.670 --> 06:15:35.680 align:start position:0%
legislation I think about what he would
 
06:15:38.468 --> 06:15:38.478 align:start position:0%
have said about it what he in fact did
 
06:15:42.230 --> 06:15:42.240 align:start position:0%
say on this very issue uh he did not say
 
06:15:44.910 --> 06:15:44.920 align:start position:0%
that it was a good idea for state
 
06:15:46.750 --> 06:15:46.760 align:start position:0%
governments to pass legislation like
 
06:15:49.390 --> 06:15:49.400 align:start position:0%
these the exact quote was it will be a
 
06:15:54.150 --> 06:15:54.160 align:start position:0%
the solemn duty of state governments to
 
06:15:56.110 --> 06:15:56.120 align:start position:0%
protect their own authority over their
 
06:15:59.150 --> 06:15:59.160 align:start position:0%
own militia and to interpose between
 
06:16:01.468 --> 06:16:01.478 align:start position:0%
their citizens and arbitrary power
 
06:16:04.590 --> 06:16:04.600 align:start position:0%
wielded by the federal government so
 
06:16:05.948 --> 06:16:05.958 align:start position:0%
that's not not my opinion that's Daniel
 
06:16:08.230 --> 06:16:08.240 align:start position:0%
Webster's opinion that it is the solemn
 
06:16:10.468 --> 06:16:10.478 align:start position:0%
duty of this legislature to pass
 
06:16:13.390 --> 06:16:13.400 align:start position:0%
legislation like this in defense of your
 
06:16:16.070 --> 06:16:16.080 align:start position:0%
State National
 
06:16:19.270 --> 06:16:19.280 align:start position:0%
Guard it's been well over two decades
 
06:16:22.190 --> 06:16:22.200 align:start position:0%
now since the dawn of the war on terror
 
06:16:24.230 --> 06:16:24.240 align:start position:0%
I find it very interesting sitting here
 
06:16:25.670 --> 06:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
listening to some of the arguments
 
06:16:26.830 --> 06:16:26.840 align:start position:0%
against this
 
06:16:29.430 --> 06:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
legislation and the but what's
 
06:16:30.430 --> 06:16:30.440 align:start position:0%
particularly interesting is the
 
06:16:33.788 --> 06:16:33.798 align:start position:0%
arguments that I am not hearing I'm not
 
06:16:35.750 --> 06:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
hearing from anyone arguments we may
 
06:16:38.788 --> 06:16:38.798 align:start position:0%
have heard maybe even a decade ago that
 
06:16:40.708 --> 06:16:40.718 align:start position:0%
these wars that our State national
 
06:16:43.030 --> 06:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
Guardsmen from the various 50 states
 
06:16:45.708 --> 06:16:45.718 align:start position:0%
have accounted for almost half of the
 
06:16:47.030 --> 06:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
troops on the ground in these wars in
 
06:16:48.628 --> 06:16:48.638 align:start position:0%
the Middle East I don't hear the
 
06:16:50.750 --> 06:16:50.760 align:start position:0%
arguments that these are Wars for
 
06:16:54.708 --> 06:16:54.718 align:start position:0%
freedom for democracy for some Noble
 
06:16:57.030 --> 06:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
purpose I don't hear the arguments that
 
06:16:58.990 --> 06:16:59.000 align:start position:0%
there are clearly defined
 
06:17:01.830 --> 06:17:01.840 align:start position:0%
missions which we clearly owe to those
 
06:17:03.990 --> 06:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
we put into positions where they're
 
06:17:05.910 --> 06:17:05.920 align:start position:0%
risking their lives
 
06:17:08.310 --> 06:17:08.320 align:start position:0%
I don't hear arguments in favor of the
 
06:17:10.430 --> 06:17:10.440 align:start position:0%
merits of these wars that we're sending
 
06:17:14.310 --> 06:17:14.320 align:start position:0%
our our our um men and women in uniform
 
06:17:18.150 --> 06:17:18.160 align:start position:0%
off off to fight in what I hear is well
 
06:17:19.670 --> 06:17:19.680 align:start position:0%
what about
 
06:17:22.190 --> 06:17:22.200 align:start position:0%
money uh I think it's been argued well
 
06:17:23.948 --> 06:17:23.958 align:start position:0%
that I think a lot of the threats to U
 
06:17:28.070 --> 06:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
money are somewhat of a paper tiger um
 
06:17:30.510 --> 06:17:30.520 align:start position:0%
but you know one thing I've always long
 
06:17:32.948 --> 06:17:32.958 align:start position:0%
admired uh from across the border in the
 
06:17:36.510 --> 06:17:36.520 align:start position:0%
state of Maine was even on what seems
 
06:17:39.430 --> 06:17:39.440 align:start position:0%
like small almost trivial matters of
 
06:17:41.430 --> 06:17:41.440 align:start position:0%
individual human Liberty New Hampshire
 
06:17:43.510 --> 06:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
has always kind of stood strong against
 
06:17:45.750 --> 06:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
the federal government and saying no we
 
06:17:47.510 --> 06:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
will not make those sacrifices for
 
06:17:49.788 --> 06:17:49.798 align:start position:0%
federal funds I think about even
 
06:17:51.750 --> 06:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
something as trivial as mandatory seat
 
06:17:53.750 --> 06:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
Bel laws for adults New Hampshire is the
 
06:17:55.190 --> 06:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
only state in the Union that told the
 
06:17:57.070 --> 06:17:57.080 align:start position:0%
federal government go take your Federal
 
06:17:59.310 --> 06:17:59.320 align:start position:0%
Highway funds and stuff it we're not
 
06:18:01.430 --> 06:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
going to infringe on the Liberties of
 
06:18:03.230 --> 06:18:03.240 align:start position:0%
our adult citizens to make these choices
 
06:18:06.350 --> 06:18:06.360 align:start position:0%
for themselves uh I asked grock how much
 
06:18:08.788 --> 06:18:08.798 align:start position:0%
is lost a year about 3.7 million
 
06:18:10.708 --> 06:18:10.718 align:start position:0%
according to AI I don't know if that's
 
06:18:14.270 --> 06:18:14.280 align:start position:0%
accurate or not and um aren't the lives
 
06:18:16.390 --> 06:18:16.400 align:start position:0%
of our men and women in uniform worth at
 
06:18:19.390 --> 06:18:19.400 align:start position:0%
least 15 times of the little piece of
 
06:18:21.350 --> 06:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
freedom on whether or not to wear a seat
 
06:18:24.110 --> 06:18:24.120 align:start position:0%
belt if we're willing to say to the
 
06:18:26.110 --> 06:18:26.120 align:start position:0%
federal government we're standing on a
 
06:18:28.430 --> 06:18:28.440 align:start position:0%
principle for the Liberties of our
 
06:18:31.230 --> 06:18:31.240 align:start position:0%
citizens in that case should that not
 
06:18:33.910 --> 06:18:33.920 align:start position:0%
apply even more so here but let's talk
 
06:18:35.430 --> 06:18:35.440 align:start position:0%
about the constitu because I think there
 
06:18:37.788 --> 06:18:37.798 align:start position:0%
were a lot of arguments around the
 
06:18:39.430 --> 06:18:39.440 align:start position:0%
Constitution made here I think it's very
 
06:18:41.948 --> 06:18:41.958 align:start position:0%
worth understanding zeroing in on what
 
06:18:43.868 --> 06:18:43.878 align:start position:0%
specifically the Constitution says about
 
06:18:45.910 --> 06:18:45.920 align:start position:0%
this the Constitution says that the
 
06:18:48.110 --> 06:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
federal government May mobilize the
 
06:18:50.270 --> 06:18:50.280 align:start position:0%
militias which we now call the National
 
06:18:52.948 --> 06:18:52.958 align:start position:0%
Guard under three circumstances and
 
06:18:56.190 --> 06:18:56.200 align:start position:0%
three circumstances alone to suppress
 
06:18:59.030 --> 06:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
Insurrection to repel Invasion to
 
06:19:01.548 --> 06:19:01.558 align:start position:0%
enforce the laws of the union and to
 
06:19:03.510 --> 06:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
take an example that was used previously
 
06:19:04.990 --> 06:19:05.000 align:start position:0%
by the bill sponsor represent pres of
 
06:19:08.230 --> 06:19:08.240 align:start position:0%
Tom Manion of Syria a war that we had
 
06:19:12.190 --> 06:19:12.200 align:start position:0%
been engaged in now for over 10 years
 
06:19:15.350 --> 06:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
without even a clear aumf or or clear
 
06:19:17.868 --> 06:19:17.878 align:start position:0%
authorization what is the
 
06:19:20.350 --> 06:19:20.360 align:start position:0%
Constitutional um justification for
 
06:19:21.830 --> 06:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
having National Guard troops in a
 
06:19:24.110 --> 06:19:24.120 align:start position:0%
conflict like that were we suppressing
 
06:19:26.510 --> 06:19:26.520 align:start position:0%
an Insurrection actually the mission in
 
06:19:28.590 --> 06:19:28.600 align:start position:0%
Syria was to ferment an Insurrection and
 
06:19:30.150 --> 06:19:30.160 align:start position:0%
to ferment a civil war against the
 
06:19:32.670 --> 06:19:32.680 align:start position:0%
established government there um was it
 
06:19:35.708 --> 06:19:35.718 align:start position:0%
to repel an invasion now was an invasion
 
06:19:38.190 --> 06:19:38.200 align:start position:0%
but we weren't the ones repelling it we
 
06:19:41.150 --> 06:19:41.160 align:start position:0%
were not invited there was it to enforce
 
06:19:42.948 --> 06:19:42.958 align:start position:0%
a law of the Union it very well could
 
06:19:45.310 --> 06:19:45.320 align:start position:0%
have been if there had been a
 
06:19:47.150 --> 06:19:47.160 align:start position:0%
congressional declaration of war as the
 
06:19:49.670 --> 06:19:49.680 align:start position:0%
Constitution requires uh even if you
 
06:19:51.830 --> 06:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
accept the argument of an aumf covering
 
06:19:53.430 --> 06:19:53.440 align:start position:0%
that requirement which I don't accept
 
06:19:56.150 --> 06:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
it's it's very clear there was no aumf
 
06:19:59.948 --> 06:19:59.958 align:start position:0%
that covered this because um they point
 
06:20:02.910 --> 06:20:02.920 align:start position:0%
to the 2001 aumf which was passed in the
 
06:20:05.070 --> 06:20:05.080 align:start position:0%
aftermath of the 911 Twin Tower attacks
 
06:20:07.110 --> 06:20:07.120 align:start position:0%
when we were attacked by Al-Qaeda
 
06:20:08.628 --> 06:20:08.638 align:start position:0%
presumably this is
 
06:20:12.750 --> 06:20:12.760 align:start position:0%
to fight the the folks who attacked us
 
06:20:16.310 --> 06:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
on that terrible day and yet uh we
 
06:20:18.750 --> 06:20:18.760 align:start position:0%
actively gave weapons and Aid and
 
06:20:21.150 --> 06:20:21.160 align:start position:0%
comfort to Al-Qaeda forces in Syria so
 
06:20:24.190 --> 06:20:24.200 align:start position:0%
it's hard to imagine how that aumf could
 
06:20:26.548 --> 06:20:26.558 align:start position:0%
apply to that
 
06:20:29.310 --> 06:20:29.320 align:start position:0%
situation uh James Madison spoke
 
06:20:31.110 --> 06:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
eloquently about the need and when
 
06:20:32.910 --> 06:20:32.920 align:start position:0%
studied care why they separated the
 
06:20:34.910 --> 06:20:34.920 align:start position:0%
power to declare war from the power to
 
06:20:36.750 --> 06:20:36.760 align:start position:0%
wage war because the executive has the
 
06:20:39.070 --> 06:20:39.080 align:start position:0%
most gain in times of War this principle
 
06:20:42.150 --> 06:20:42.160 align:start position:0%
has been totally lost in recent history
 
06:20:44.270 --> 06:20:44.280 align:start position:0%
we've heard about the supremacy clause
 
06:20:46.110 --> 06:20:46.120 align:start position:0%
and how the supremacy clause supposedly
 
06:20:47.830 --> 06:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
means means we need to bow down in
 
06:20:49.070 --> 06:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
deference to everything the federal
 
06:20:51.948 --> 06:20:51.958 align:start position:0%
government mandates on us but that's not
 
06:20:53.708 --> 06:20:53.718 align:start position:0%
how to properly understand the supremacy
 
06:20:56.150 --> 06:20:56.160 align:start position:0%
clause they have Supremacy over powers
 
06:20:58.468 --> 06:20:58.478 align:start position:0%
that are exp explicitly granted to them
 
06:21:01.750 --> 06:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
the the specific enumerated powers in
 
06:21:03.270 --> 06:21:03.280 align:start position:0%
Article 1 Section 8 of the US
 
06:21:04.868 --> 06:21:04.878 align:start position:0%
Constitution which includes the power to
 
06:21:07.868 --> 06:21:07.878 align:start position:0%
declare war if they declared war we
 
06:21:09.990 --> 06:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
would be subject to the supremacy clause
 
06:21:12.190 --> 06:21:12.200 align:start position:0%
but as so long as they do not declare
 
06:21:15.468 --> 06:21:15.478 align:start position:0%
war that does not apply here the fact of
 
06:21:17.390 --> 06:21:17.400 align:start position:0%
the matter is Congress won't do its job
 
06:21:20.190 --> 06:21:20.200 align:start position:0%
because it's very convenient not to uh
 
06:21:23.070 --> 06:21:23.080 align:start position:0%
the last time even even the aumf on the
 
06:21:24.750 --> 06:21:24.760 align:start position:0%
war in Iraq when it was voted on there
 
06:21:26.510 --> 06:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
was some mechanism for people to look at
 
06:21:29.190 --> 06:21:29.200 align:start position:0%
people's voting records and to hold uh
 
06:21:30.910 --> 06:21:30.920 align:start position:0%
Representatives accountable in election
 
06:21:33.628 --> 06:21:33.638 align:start position:0%
season if they found that to be uh a not
 
06:21:36.468 --> 06:21:36.478 align:start position:0%
very prudent course action and
 
06:21:38.390 --> 06:21:38.400 align:start position:0%
politicians did lose their jobs in the
 
06:21:40.670 --> 06:21:40.680 align:start position:0%
aftermath of that fact Hillary Clinton
 
06:21:42.110 --> 06:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
didn't become president because of that
 
06:21:44.350 --> 06:21:44.360 align:start position:0%
instead you got a rookie US senator from
 
06:21:46.590 --> 06:21:46.600 align:start position:0%
Illinois Barack Obama on that particular
 
06:21:49.110 --> 06:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
issue one one one the primary so there
 
06:21:50.948 --> 06:21:50.958 align:start position:0%
was a a chilling effect sent throughout
 
06:21:52.628 --> 06:21:52.638 align:start position:0%
Congress we don't want to ever vote on
 
06:21:56.230 --> 06:21:56.240 align:start position:0%
war ever again but it's really nice to
 
06:21:57.830 --> 06:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
keep collecting checks from the
 
06:21:59.390 --> 06:21:59.400 align:start position:0%
companies that are making money on these
 
06:22:01.430 --> 06:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
wars and so what we've seen over the
 
06:22:03.788 --> 06:22:03.798 align:start position:0%
course of the last two decades are
 
06:22:06.310 --> 06:22:06.320 align:start position:0%
situations like we saw revealed in the
 
06:22:08.590 --> 06:22:08.600 align:start position:0%
Afghanistan papers of self-licking ice
 
06:22:11.190 --> 06:22:11.200 align:start position:0%
cream cones forever Wars that just go on
 
06:22:13.830 --> 06:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
and on and on with no clear Mission
 
06:22:16.548 --> 06:22:16.558 align:start position:0%
whatsoever uh and the ex the price is
 
06:22:20.270 --> 06:22:20.280 align:start position:0%
paid not just by the us taxpayers but by
 
06:22:22.708 --> 06:22:22.718 align:start position:0%
our soldiers who we send off without
 
06:22:22.718 --> 06:22:23.948 align:start position:0%
our soldiers who we send off without
clear

06:22:23.948 --> 06:22:23.958 align:start position:0%
clear
 
06:22:27.548 --> 06:22:27.558 align:start position:0%
missions I remember um a good friend of
 
06:22:29.350 --> 06:22:29.360 align:start position:0%
mine um who I worked with on this
 
06:22:30.948 --> 06:22:30.958 align:start position:0%
legislation in the state of Maine his
 
06:22:33.030 --> 06:22:33.040 align:start position:0%
name was Sergeant Aaron Rollins he had
 
06:22:35.788 --> 06:22:35.798 align:start position:0%
served in Iraq in the main Army National
 
06:22:39.590 --> 06:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
Guard and on one uh one fateful day uh
 
06:22:43.468 --> 06:22:43.478 align:start position:0%
they they were um their vehicle uh hit a
 
06:22:47.750 --> 06:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
roadside bomb and his um one of his uh
 
06:22:49.948 --> 06:22:49.958 align:start position:0%
companions was tragically killed that
 
06:22:51.430 --> 06:22:51.440 align:start position:0%
day sitting in the seat where he
 
06:22:53.628 --> 06:22:53.638 align:start position:0%
normally would have been SE seated
 
06:22:56.590 --> 06:22:56.600 align:start position:0%
himself I remember um after the public
 
06:22:58.628 --> 06:22:58.638 align:start position:0%
Hearing in Maine two years ago when the
 
06:23:00.670 --> 06:23:00.680 align:start position:0%
agitant general made I think similar
 
06:23:02.190 --> 06:23:02.200 align:start position:0%
arguments to what we've heard heard
 
06:23:05.190 --> 06:23:05.200 align:start position:0%
today about concerns about money
 
06:23:07.230 --> 06:23:07.240 align:start position:0%
after that Sergeant Rollins turned to me
 
06:23:10.430 --> 06:23:10.440 align:start position:0%
and just saidou know I wish that the
 
06:23:13.590 --> 06:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
agitant general would say that to my
 
06:23:16.270 --> 06:23:16.280 align:start position:0%
mother my my friend's mother's face that
 
06:23:18.390 --> 06:23:18.400 align:start position:0%
his death was worth it because the state
 
06:23:21.230 --> 06:23:21.240 align:start position:0%
got a few extra Humvees out of the deal
 
06:23:24.390 --> 06:23:24.400 align:start position:0%
I don't think that that is a um an
 
06:23:26.910 --> 06:23:26.920 align:start position:0%
argument we would accept in many other
 
06:23:29.270 --> 06:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
situations where there's there are
 
06:23:32.708 --> 06:23:32.718 align:start position:0%
significant moral questions at stake um
 
06:23:34.788 --> 06:23:34.798 align:start position:0%
if uh I know there are wide ranging
 
06:23:36.590 --> 06:23:36.600 align:start position:0%
opinions on other issues like abortion
 
06:23:38.750 --> 06:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
you know would we whatever someone's
 
06:23:40.590 --> 06:23:40.600 align:start position:0%
moral conviction is on an issue like
 
06:23:43.628 --> 06:23:43.638 align:start position:0%
abortion would we overthrow that moral
 
06:23:45.150 --> 06:23:45.160 align:start position:0%
opinion be if the federal government
 
06:23:47.788 --> 06:23:47.798 align:start position:0%
started throwing money around one way or
 
06:23:50.310 --> 06:23:50.320 align:start position:0%
the other I I don't think so you need to
 
06:23:53.070 --> 06:23:53.080 align:start position:0%
suspend for a moment yes we I think
 
06:23:57.830 --> 06:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
we're all tracking your point about the
 
06:24:00.270 --> 06:24:00.280 align:start position:0%
government's role in decision- making
 
06:24:02.110 --> 06:24:02.120 align:start position:0%
and financing and in abortion we're
 
06:24:05.590 --> 06:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
getting a little bit off off the uh the
 
06:24:08.150 --> 06:24:08.160 align:start position:0%
focus on this particular measure uh
 
06:24:09.510 --> 06:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
there may be a couple of questions for
 
06:24:11.468 --> 06:24:11.478 align:start position:0%
you but uh I I want to give you a chance
 
06:24:13.750 --> 06:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
to finish and we s of five other folks
 
06:24:15.270 --> 06:24:15.280 align:start position:0%
that we want to give some time to
 
06:24:17.110 --> 06:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
understood I appreciate that I will wrap
 
06:24:21.150 --> 06:24:21.160 align:start position:0%
up uh trying to uh make an analogy but I
 
06:24:23.270 --> 06:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
understand the concern there I'll just
 
06:24:25.628 --> 06:24:25.638 align:start position:0%
close by saying
 
06:24:27.830 --> 06:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
um you know we are at a point the the
 
06:24:29.788 --> 06:24:29.798 align:start position:0%
incoming Secretary of Defense or at
 
06:24:30.990 --> 06:24:31.000 align:start position:0%
least who has been appointed and the
 
06:24:32.788 --> 06:24:32.798 align:start position:0%
incoming National Intelligence director
 
06:24:34.430 --> 06:24:34.440 align:start position:0%
who has been appointed both support this
 
06:24:36.350 --> 06:24:36.360 align:start position:0%
legislation or have been on record in
 
06:24:38.750 --> 06:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
support of it um I think now is the time
 
06:24:40.510 --> 06:24:40.520 align:start position:0%
to really lay down this principle on the
 
06:24:42.548 --> 06:24:42.558 align:start position:0%
state level and and I I hear what people
 
06:24:44.350 --> 06:24:44.360 align:start position:0%
say that wouldn't it be nice if this
 
06:24:46.270 --> 06:24:46.280 align:start position:0%
could be solved on the federal level but
 
06:24:47.830 --> 06:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
there's a convergence of interests that
 
06:24:49.150 --> 06:24:49.160 align:start position:0%
don't want this to be solved on the
 
06:24:51.430 --> 06:24:51.440 align:start position:0%
federal level uh and so therefore as
 
06:24:54.230 --> 06:24:54.240 align:start position:0%
Daniel Webster told us it is the solemn
 
06:24:57.230 --> 06:24:57.240 align:start position:0%
duty of the states to interpose and to
 
06:24:59.150 --> 06:24:59.160 align:start position:0%
stand up for our men and women in
 
06:25:01.670 --> 06:25:01.680 align:start position:0%
uniform and so I certainly as a new
 
06:25:03.350 --> 06:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
resident of New Hampshire I would ask
 
06:25:05.708 --> 06:25:05.718 align:start position:0%
you to do do your solemn Duty and to
 
06:25:07.390 --> 06:25:07.400 align:start position:0%
support this legislation thank you if
 
06:25:08.788 --> 06:25:08.798 align:start position:0%
there are questions I'm happy to take
 
06:25:11.708 --> 06:25:11.718 align:start position:0%
them or to defer to others I I do have a
 
06:25:14.708 --> 06:25:14.718 align:start position:0%
quick question I naturally am curious uh
 
06:25:16.708 --> 06:25:16.718 align:start position:0%
you shared that you were a state senator
 
06:25:18.868 --> 06:25:18.878 align:start position:0%
and you introduced a similar measure or
 
06:25:21.510 --> 06:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
the same measure in Maine uh what what
 
06:25:23.468 --> 06:25:23.478 align:start position:0%
happened uh in Maine when when you
 
06:25:25.750 --> 06:25:25.760 align:start position:0%
introduced this in the Maine Senate yeah
 
06:25:27.110 --> 06:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
there's a long history of this in Maine
 
06:25:29.230 --> 06:25:29.240 align:start position:0%
it was actually um I'll give you the
 
06:25:31.350 --> 06:25:31.360 align:start position:0%
short yeah yeah give us the short answer
 
06:25:32.708 --> 06:25:32.718 align:start position:0%
all right Maine was the first state to
 
06:25:36.510 --> 06:25:36.520 align:start position:0%
ever put this in in 2011 11 um two years
 
06:25:40.430 --> 06:25:40.440 align:start position:0%
ago it received a uh uh a third of the
 
06:25:41.868 --> 06:25:41.878 align:start position:0%
House of Representatives voted in
 
06:25:43.468 --> 06:25:43.478 align:start position:0%
support of the bill with a with
 
06:25:45.948 --> 06:25:45.958 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support but there's still uh
 
06:25:48.628 --> 06:25:48.638 align:start position:0%
a lot more uh work that needs to be done
 
06:25:50.990 --> 06:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
in Maine and other states but I think it
 
06:25:53.230 --> 06:25:53.240 align:start position:0%
would be very poetic and also very
 
06:25:55.990 --> 06:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
righteous if uh New Hampshire followed
 
06:25:58.750 --> 06:25:58.760 align:start position:0%
Daniel Webster's call and was the first
 
06:26:01.830 --> 06:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
other questions repr mle bomb thank you
 
06:26:04.390 --> 06:26:04.400 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um Mr Brey I don't want to
 
06:26:07.150 --> 06:26:07.160 align:start position:0%
get too into the semantic Weeds about
 
06:26:11.510 --> 06:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
your seat Bel law analogy um but
 
06:26:13.468 --> 06:26:13.478 align:start position:0%
ultimately whether or not you wear a
 
06:26:16.350 --> 06:26:16.360 align:start position:0%
seat belt you are the person who faces
 
06:26:19.350 --> 06:26:19.360 align:start position:0%
the most proximate impact so if you're
 
06:26:22.190 --> 06:26:22.200 align:start position:0%
in an accident you will likely either
 
06:26:24.468 --> 06:26:24.478 align:start position:0%
stay seated or perhaps go through the
 
06:26:26.830 --> 06:26:26.840 align:start position:0%
windshield but that's on you I'm
 
06:26:29.750 --> 06:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
wondering um you do you feel your
 
06:26:31.708 --> 06:26:31.718 align:start position:0%
argument holds up given that we could
 
06:26:34.230 --> 06:26:34.240 align:start position:0%
have argued that the National Guard is a
 
06:26:38.830 --> 06:26:38.840 align:start position:0%
Collective good so um it it's not just
 
06:26:41.110 --> 06:26:41.120 align:start position:0%
about the person wearing this you know
 
06:26:42.750 --> 06:26:42.760 align:start position:0%
it's the person wearing the seat Bel
 
06:26:45.708 --> 06:26:45.718 align:start position:0%
isn't the only person affected it's when
 
06:26:48.750 --> 06:26:48.760 align:start position:0%
you have National Guard members deployed
 
06:26:50.948 --> 06:26:50.958 align:start position:0%
they're doing work on behalf of the
 
06:26:50.958 --> 06:26:52.628 align:start position:0%
they're doing work on behalf of the
United

06:26:52.628 --> 06:26:52.638 align:start position:0%
United
 
06:26:54.948 --> 06:26:54.958 align:start position:0%
States would just say I think it's far
 
06:26:57.510 --> 06:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
more important than any seat Bel law I
 
06:27:00.390 --> 06:27:00.400 align:start position:0%
think that it is um I think that we have
 
06:27:04.628 --> 06:27:04.638 align:start position:0%
a solemn duty to the men and women who
 
06:27:07.350 --> 06:27:07.360 align:start position:0%
sign up to serve who are in a position
 
06:27:10.628 --> 06:27:10.638 align:start position:0%
where they cannot speak up they cannot
 
06:27:12.468 --> 06:27:12.478 align:start position:0%
question their orders they are given
 
06:27:17.110 --> 06:27:17.120 align:start position:0%
commands to go it is our solemn Duty as
 
06:27:18.708 --> 06:27:18.718 align:start position:0%
the citizens of the state and this
 
06:27:21.468 --> 06:27:21.478 align:start position:0%
country to hold accountable the
 
06:27:23.110 --> 06:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
officials who make these decisions when
 
06:27:25.670 --> 06:27:25.680 align:start position:0%
those decisions are made poorly and
 
06:27:28.350 --> 06:27:28.360 align:start position:0%
right now there is no accountability
 
06:27:30.110 --> 06:27:30.120 align:start position:0%
measure because our elected officials
 
06:27:32.150 --> 06:27:32.160 align:start position:0%
don't vote they don't do their jobs and
 
06:27:34.708 --> 06:27:34.718 align:start position:0%
so I would say it's even more important
 
06:27:34.718 --> 06:27:35.468 align:start position:0%
so I would say it's even more important
follow

06:27:35.468 --> 06:27:35.478 align:start position:0%
follow
 
06:27:38.270 --> 06:27:38.280 align:start position:0%
up thank you Mr chairman so is the
 
06:27:41.510 --> 06:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
difference in your mind more that Justus
 
06:27:44.030 --> 06:27:44.040 align:start position:0%
as folks can choose to wear a seat belt
 
06:27:46.030 --> 06:27:46.040 align:start position:0%
folks in the National or choose not to
 
06:27:48.230 --> 06:27:48.240 align:start position:0%
folks in the National Guard do not have
 
06:27:49.910 --> 06:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
decision-making power when it comes to
 
06:27:49.920 --> 06:27:51.910 align:start position:0%
decision-making power when it comes to
being

06:27:51.910 --> 06:27:51.920 align:start position:0%
being
 
06:27:54.030 --> 06:27:54.040 align:start position:0%
deployed once they sign up to serve
 
06:27:56.230 --> 06:27:56.240 align:start position:0%
their state and the State National Guard
 
06:27:59.468 --> 06:27:59.478 align:start position:0%
they uh do not have much say about about
 
06:28:01.030 --> 06:28:01.040 align:start position:0%
these deployments therefore it is the
 
06:28:02.948 --> 06:28:02.958 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the citizenry to make
 
06:28:04.590 --> 06:28:04.600 align:start position:0%
sure that the system is function in an
 
06:28:07.788 --> 06:28:07.798 align:start position:0%
accountable fashion thank you other
 
06:28:10.468 --> 06:28:10.478 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you so much
 
06:28:12.948 --> 06:28:12.958 align:start position:0%
for that testimony thank you Mr chair we
 
06:28:14.310 --> 06:28:14.320 align:start position:0%
have we do have another former
 
06:28:16.350 --> 06:28:16.360 align:start position:0%
representative here uh we did yes we
 
06:28:20.788 --> 06:28:20.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:23.590 --> 06:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
geard who is a former member of this
 
06:28:25.548 --> 06:28:25.558 align:start position:0%
body who supports the bill he's asked
 
06:28:27.990 --> 06:28:28.000 align:start position:0%
for three minutes and yeah I'll make it
 
06:28:29.628 --> 06:28:29.638 align:start position:0%
shorter than that thank you chairman uh
 
06:28:31.230 --> 06:28:31.240 align:start position:0%
Just for future notice I I don't like
 
06:28:32.830 --> 06:28:32.840 align:start position:0%
the honorable title any titles of
 
06:28:34.868 --> 06:28:34.878 align:start position:0%
nobility kind of make me a little quey
 
06:28:37.830 --> 06:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
but I want to so noted thank you so I
 
06:28:39.788 --> 06:28:39.798 align:start position:0%
wanted to raise a few
 
06:28:42.110 --> 06:28:42.120 align:start position:0%
points we we seem to be getting caught
 
06:28:44.070 --> 06:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
up in this money argument and previous
 
06:28:45.270 --> 06:28:45.280 align:start position:0%
speakers already talked about the
 
06:28:46.708 --> 06:28:46.718 align:start position:0%
absurdity of trying to put a price on
 
06:28:49.510 --> 06:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
the lives of our New Hampshire neighbors
 
06:28:52.310 --> 06:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
to go fight Wars that are never ending
 
06:28:54.628 --> 06:28:54.638 align:start position:0%
but also I would like to talk about the
 
06:28:57.548 --> 06:28:57.558 align:start position:0%
suicides so this is an article from July
 
06:28:59.030 --> 06:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
15th of
 
06:29:02.430 --> 06:29:02.440 align:start position:0%
2024 from Boston University suicide now
 
06:29:04.310 --> 06:29:04.320 align:start position:0%
the primary cause of death among active
 
06:29:07.350 --> 06:29:07.360 align:start position:0%
duty US soldiers quick paragraph a
 
06:29:08.830 --> 06:29:08.840 align:start position:0%
recent study released by The Pentagon
 
06:29:11.270 --> 06:29:11.280 align:start position:0%
revealed a sobering statistic US US
 
06:29:13.030 --> 06:29:13.040 align:start position:0%
soldiers are now more likely to die from
 
06:29:15.670 --> 06:29:15.680 align:start position:0%
suicide than any other cause the report
 
06:29:18.070 --> 06:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
which examined the deaths of 2530 active
 
06:29:20.750 --> 06:29:20.760 align:start position:0%
duty army soldiers between 2014 and 2019
 
06:29:22.750 --> 06:29:22.760 align:start position:0%
showed that soldiers are nearly nine
 
06:29:25.230 --> 06:29:25.240 align:start position:0%
times more likely to die by Suicide than
 
06:29:27.430 --> 06:29:27.440 align:start position:0%
they are in combat and I just worry that
 
06:29:29.390 --> 06:29:29.400 align:start position:0%
we kind of focus on the combat deaths
 
06:29:32.070 --> 06:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
which are horrible as it may as they are
 
06:29:34.190 --> 06:29:34.200 align:start position:0%
but we also we need to think about about
 
06:29:35.390 --> 06:29:35.400 align:start position:0%
the guys that are living on the streets
 
06:29:38.350 --> 06:29:38.360 align:start position:0%
or other kinds of horrible situations
 
06:29:41.548 --> 06:29:41.558 align:start position:0%
that occur from the trauma of combat
 
06:29:45.590 --> 06:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
combat that I'm 39 years old now my twin
 
06:29:47.150 --> 06:29:47.160 align:start position:0%
brother identical twin brother joined a
 
06:29:50.350 --> 06:29:50.360 align:start position:0%
National Guard in 03 shipped out in ' 04
 
06:29:52.310 --> 06:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
he ended up going active duty but he
 
06:29:55.750 --> 06:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
went over to Iraq and we have we've
 
06:29:58.510 --> 06:29:58.520 align:start position:0%
never been out of War since then I mean
 
06:30:00.230 --> 06:30:00.240 align:start position:0%
I'm 39 I mean it's absurd when you
 
06:30:02.310 --> 06:30:02.320 align:start position:0%
really sit back and you look at it we
 
06:30:05.150 --> 06:30:05.160 align:start position:0%
it's just constant War for various
 
06:30:07.350 --> 06:30:07.360 align:start position:0%
madeup make you know reasons let's look
 
06:30:10.030 --> 06:30:10.040 align:start position:0%
at one of these that was raised earlier
 
06:30:13.350 --> 06:30:13.360 align:start position:0%
which would be sorry phone's acting up
 
06:30:15.990 --> 06:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
the Gulf of tonen this is from the US
 
06:30:19.070 --> 06:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
Naval um magazine I'm sorry I'm having a
 
06:30:21.070 --> 06:30:21.080 align:start position:0%
trou figure US Naval Institute magazine
 
06:30:23.230 --> 06:30:23.240 align:start position:0%
the truth about tonen this lead
 
06:30:24.468 --> 06:30:24.478 align:start position:0%
paragraph questions about the Gulf of
 
06:30:26.230 --> 06:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
tonen incidents have persisted for more
 
06:30:28.230 --> 06:30:28.240 align:start position:0%
than 40 years but once classified
 
06:30:29.708 --> 06:30:29.718 align:start position:0%
documents and tapes released in the past
 
06:30:31.230 --> 06:30:31.240 align:start position:0%
several years combined with previously
 
06:30:34.310 --> 06:30:34.320 align:start position:0%
uncovered facts make clear that High
 
06:30:36.190 --> 06:30:36.200 align:start position:0%
government officials distorted facts and
 
06:30:37.788 --> 06:30:37.798 align:start position:0%
deceived the American public about
 
06:30:39.110 --> 06:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
events that led to the full us
 
06:30:41.310 --> 06:30:41.320 align:start position:0%
involvement in the Vietnam
 
06:30:44.510 --> 06:30:44.520 align:start position:0%
War so like many other people I question
 
06:30:47.230 --> 06:30:47.240 align:start position:0%
the motives of our federal government
 
06:30:50.110 --> 06:30:50.120 align:start position:0%
and some in state government but I just
 
06:30:52.830 --> 06:30:52.840 align:start position:0%
I I feel that we're giving too
 
06:30:56.948 --> 06:30:56.958 align:start position:0%
much leeway to people who have blatantly
 
06:30:58.468 --> 06:30:58.478 align:start position:0%
disrespected the Constitution which they
 
06:31:00.670 --> 06:31:00.680 align:start position:0%
sworn oath to uphold and which all of
 
06:31:03.190 --> 06:31:03.200 align:start position:0%
you have as well and I as well as our
 
06:31:04.670 --> 06:31:04.680 align:start position:0%
military person
 
06:31:06.548 --> 06:31:06.558 align:start position:0%
and another man who just this last
 
06:31:08.990 --> 06:31:09.000 align:start position:0%
closing thing Major General Smedley
 
06:31:11.510 --> 06:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
Butler who wrote War is a racket is very
 
06:31:14.270 --> 06:31:14.280 align:start position:0%
quick pamphlet got to read it very good
 
06:31:16.910 --> 06:31:16.920 align:start position:0%
but he Ser he was born in 1881 died in
 
06:31:18.670 --> 06:31:18.680 align:start position:0%
1940 but he was a United States Marine
 
06:31:21.628 --> 06:31:21.638 align:start position:0%
Corps officer and writer 34 years he
 
06:31:23.110 --> 06:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
fought in the Philippine American war
 
06:31:24.990 --> 06:31:25.000 align:start position:0%
box Rebellion Mexican Revolution World
 
06:31:26.948 --> 06:31:26.958 align:start position:0%
War I and the banana Wars at time of his
 
06:31:28.548 --> 06:31:28.558 align:start position:0%
death Butler was the most decorated
 
06:31:31.030 --> 06:31:31.040 align:start position:0%
Marine in US military history by the end
 
06:31:32.910 --> 06:31:32.920 align:start position:0%
of his career Butler received 16 medals
 
06:31:34.750 --> 06:31:34.760 align:start position:0%
including five for har ISM he's the only
 
06:31:36.468 --> 06:31:36.478 align:start position:0%
Marine to be rewarded the Marine Corps
 
06:31:38.150 --> 06:31:38.160 align:start position:0%
brevit medal as well as two Medals of
 
06:31:40.670 --> 06:31:40.680 align:start position:0%
Honor all for separate actions two
 
06:31:42.910 --> 06:31:42.920 align:start position:0%
quotes from him very quick I believe in
 
06:31:44.468 --> 06:31:44.478 align:start position:0%
adequate defense at the coastline and
 
06:31:45.910 --> 06:31:45.920 align:start position:0%
nothing else if a nation comes over to
 
06:31:48.070 --> 06:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
here to fight then we'll fight the
 
06:31:49.350 --> 06:31:49.360 align:start position:0%
trouble with America is that when the
 
06:31:52.590 --> 06:31:52.600 align:start position:0%
dollar only earns six 6% over here then
 
06:31:54.430 --> 06:31:54.440 align:start position:0%
it gets restless and goes overseas to
 
06:31:56.788 --> 06:31:56.798 align:start position:0%
get 100% then the flag follows the
 
06:32:00.388 --> 06:32:00.398 align:start position:0%
dollar and soldiers follow the flag next
 
06:32:01.830 --> 06:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
quote there are only two reasons why you
 
06:32:03.230 --> 06:32:03.240 align:start position:0%
should ever be asked to give your
 
06:32:04.990 --> 06:32:05.000 align:start position:0%
youngsters one is defense of our homes
 
06:32:06.310 --> 06:32:06.320 align:start position:0%
the other is defense of our Bill of
 
06:32:07.948 --> 06:32:07.958 align:start position:0%
Rights and particularly the right to
 
06:32:10.190 --> 06:32:10.200 align:start position:0%
worship God as we see fit every other
 
06:32:11.628 --> 06:32:11.638 align:start position:0%
reason advance for the murder of young
 
06:32:15.628 --> 06:32:15.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:15.638 --> 06:32:17.350 align:start position:0%
 
simple

06:32:17.350 --> 06:32:17.360 align:start position:0%
simple
 
06:32:20.750 --> 06:32:20.760 align:start position:0%
and oh actually one last thing we we
 
06:32:22.468 --> 06:32:22.478 align:start position:0%
were asked about has this ever passed
 
06:32:24.310 --> 06:32:24.320 align:start position:0%
any other state hous and so forth but
 
06:32:26.510 --> 06:32:26.520 align:start position:0%
last year representative Manion actually
 
06:32:28.670 --> 06:32:28.680 align:start position:0%
had this passed at the GOP State
 
06:32:30.510 --> 06:32:30.520 align:start position:0%
Convention and it was put onto the
 
06:32:32.190 --> 06:32:32.200 align:start position:0%
platform so it is officially part of the
 
06:32:34.270 --> 06:32:34.280 align:start position:0%
Republican Party platform now now what
 
06:32:35.590 --> 06:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
that really is worth I don't know but I
 
06:32:37.150 --> 06:32:37.160 align:start position:0%
just want to make that clear that there
 
06:32:39.230 --> 06:32:39.240 align:start position:0%
is widespread widespread support among
 
06:32:42.830 --> 06:32:42.840 align:start position:0%
the rank and file of well half of the
 
06:32:43.948 --> 06:32:43.958 align:start position:0%
political part you know people in the
 
06:32:46.150 --> 06:32:46.160 align:start position:0%
country I guess you could say and I I
 
06:32:47.670 --> 06:32:47.680 align:start position:0%
really believe that we need to look at
 
06:32:49.670 --> 06:32:49.680 align:start position:0%
this outside of the money aspect or we
 
06:32:51.868 --> 06:32:51.878 align:start position:0%
have the newest flashiest aircraft all
 
06:32:54.030 --> 06:32:54.040 align:start position:0%
these absurd things we got to look at
 
06:32:55.548 --> 06:32:55.558 align:start position:0%
people in this country and how they're
 
06:32:57.150 --> 06:32:57.160 align:start position:0%
existing right now and do they even know
 
06:32:58.670 --> 06:32:58.680 align:start position:0%
where these places are that we're going
 
06:33:00.910 --> 06:33:00.920 align:start position:0%
to send our soldiers off the diet they
 
06:33:03.230 --> 06:33:03.240 align:start position:0%
don't it's fact I mean I can argue other
 
06:33:05.070 --> 06:33:05.080 align:start position:0%
things for that reason but so that's all
 
06:33:07.070 --> 06:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
I wanted to raise and uh thank you very
 
06:33:09.150 --> 06:33:09.160 align:start position:0%
much would you take any questions if
 
06:33:11.310 --> 06:33:11.320 align:start position:0%
there are any sure all right uh
 
06:33:13.708 --> 06:33:13.718 align:start position:0%
representative mle bomb uh thank you Mr
 
06:33:16.468 --> 06:33:16.478 align:start position:0%
chairman um so just to clarify when you
 
06:33:19.230 --> 06:33:19.240 align:start position:0%
studied that statistic about um US
 
06:33:21.670 --> 06:33:21.680 align:start position:0%
soldiers who are much more likely to die
 
06:33:26.190 --> 06:33:26.200 align:start position:0%
by Suicide than any other cause um was
 
06:33:29.110 --> 06:33:29.120 align:start position:0%
that overall was that broken down by
 
06:33:32.070 --> 06:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
National Guard service members versus
 
06:33:34.430 --> 06:33:34.440 align:start position:0%
someone who might be in the Marines
 
06:33:35.830 --> 06:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious if there might be any
 
06:33:37.270 --> 06:33:37.280 align:start position:0%
any differences it's from Boston
 
06:33:38.948 --> 06:33:38.958 align:start position:0%
University I'd be happy to forward it to
 
06:33:40.388 --> 06:33:40.398 align:start position:0%
the committee but at the same time as we
 
06:33:42.310 --> 06:33:42.320 align:start position:0%
heard the general rise the National
 
06:33:43.510 --> 06:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
Guard soldiers don't wear a different
 
06:33:46.150 --> 06:33:46.160 align:start position:0%
uniform they are active Army so there is
 
06:33:47.868 --> 06:33:47.878 align:start position:0%
no difference as far as I understand
 
06:33:49.270 --> 06:33:49.280 align:start position:0%
Maybe I'm Wrong I only serve two and a
 
06:33:51.590 --> 06:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
half weeks in the Army long story but
 
06:33:51.600 --> 06:33:52.670 align:start position:0%
half weeks in the Army long story but

taken from Supreme Court Justice Stevens
 
06:34:47.670 --> 06:34:47.680 align:start position:0%
who delivered a unanimous opinion on
 
06:34:51.230 --> 06:34:51.240 align:start position:0%
perit versus Department of Defense since
 
06:34:53.868 --> 06:34:53.878 align:start position:0%
1933 federal law has provided that
 
06:34:57.230 --> 06:34:57.240 align:start position:0%
persons enlisting in the National Guard
 
06:34:59.750 --> 06:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
simultaneously enlist in the National
 
06:35:02.590 --> 06:35:02.600 align:start position:0%
Guard of the United States a part of the

state guard members unless and until
 
06:35:10.190 --> 06:35:10.200 align:start position:0%
ordered to active Federal Duty and
 
06:35:12.628 --> 06:35:12.638 align:start position:0%
revert to State status upon being
 
06:35:15.230 --> 06:35:15.240 align:start position:0%
returned from federal service the
 
06:35:17.230 --> 06:35:17.240 align:start position:0%
authority to order National Guard to
 
06:35:19.230 --> 06:35:19.240 align:start position:0%
Federal Duty was limited to periods of
 
06:35:21.388 --> 06:35:21.398 align:start position:0%
National Emergency until
 
06:35:24.628 --> 06:35:24.638 align:start position:0%
1952 when Congress broadly authorized
 
06:35:27.910 --> 06:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
orders to quote to active duty or active
 
06:35:30.548 --> 06:35:30.558 align:start position:0%
duty for training unquote without any
 
06:35:32.990 --> 06:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
emergency requirement but provided that
 
06:35:35.070 --> 06:35:35.080 align:start position:0%
such orders could not be issued without
 
06:35:38.190 --> 06:35:38.200 align:start position:0%
the consent of the governor concerned
 
06:35:40.230 --> 06:35:40.240 align:start position:0%
after two State Governors refused to
 
06:35:42.190 --> 06:35:42.200 align:start position:0%
consent for federal training missions
 
06:35:44.230 --> 06:35:44.240 align:start position:0%
abroad for their guard units the
 
06:35:46.510 --> 06:35:46.520 align:start position:0%
gubernatorial consent requirement was
 
06:35:49.430 --> 06:35:49.440 align:start position:0%
partially repealed in 1986 by the
 
06:35:51.628 --> 06:35:51.638 align:start position:0%
Montgomery Amendment which provides that
 
06:35:54.150 --> 06:35:54.160 align:start position:0%
a governor cannot withhold consent with
 
06:35:56.150 --> 06:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
regard to active duty status outside of
 
06:35:58.150 --> 06:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
the United States because of Any
 
06:36:01.510 --> 06:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
objection to the location purpose type

or schedule of such Duty article one's
 
06:36:06.990 --> 06:36:07.000 align:start position:0%
plain language read as a whole
 
06:36:08.910 --> 06:36:08.920 align:start position:0%
establishes that Congress May authorize
 
06:36:10.350 --> 06:36:10.360 align:start position:0%
members of the National Guard of the
 
06:36:12.070 --> 06:36:12.080 align:start position:0%
United States to be ordered to federal
 
06:36:13.990 --> 06:36:14.000 align:start position:0%
act of Duty for the purpose of training
 
06:36:17.590 --> 06:36:17.600 align:start position:0%
outside of the United States with either
 
06:36:19.628 --> 06:36:19.638 align:start position:0%
the consent or without the consent of
 
06:36:22.190 --> 06:36:22.200 align:start position:0%

06:36:23.110 --> 06:36:23.120 align:start position:0%
National
 
06:36:26.110 --> 06:36:26.120 align:start position:0%
Emergency the interpretation presented
 
06:36:28.350 --> 06:36:28.360 align:start position:0%
recognizes the supremacy of federal
 
06:36:31.190 --> 06:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
power in military Affairs and does not
 
06:36:33.548 --> 06:36:33.558 align:start position:0%
significantly affect the state's basic
 
06:36:35.910 --> 06:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
training responsibility or its ability
 
06:36:38.468 --> 06:36:38.478 align:start position:0%
to rely on its own guard in emergency
 
06:36:41.310 --> 06:36:41.320 align:start position:0%
situations in my opinion the national
 
06:36:43.510 --> 06:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire National Guard cannot
 
06:36:46.230 --> 06:36:46.240 align:start position:0%
support and defend the Constitution of
 
06:36:49.030 --> 06:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
the United States and New Hampshire law
 
06:36:51.868 --> 06:36:51.878 align:start position:0%
if they are in Conflict if the conflict
 
06:36:54.110 --> 06:36:54.120 align:start position:0%
exists by implementing
 
06:36:57.788 --> 06:36:57.798 align:start position:0%
hb04 dfn the Department of Defense will
 
06:36:59.830 --> 06:36:59.840 align:start position:0%
cut funding to the New Hampshire
 
06:37:02.310 --> 06:37:02.320 align:start position:0%
National Guard and move it to states
 
06:37:04.910 --> 06:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
with similar mission capab abilities and
 
06:37:07.590 --> 06:37:07.600 align:start position:0%
no conflict the net result will be an
 
06:37:11.948 --> 06:37:11.958 align:start position:0%
annual loss of $395 million and the loss
 
06:37:15.510 --> 06:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
of 2700 jobs soldiers and Airmen and
 
06:37:17.788 --> 06:37:17.798 align:start position:0%
women in New Hampshire will potentially
 
06:37:20.830 --> 06:37:20.840 align:start position:0%
lose their military careers or suffer
 
06:37:22.948 --> 06:37:22.958 align:start position:0%
the inconvenience of relocating to

another state I stand in opposition to
 
06:37:32.430 --> 06:37:32.440 align:start position:0%

service um so I had asked this to two
 
06:38:18.270 --> 06:38:18.280 align:start position:0%
other people where do you see the
 
06:38:20.510 --> 06:38:20.520 align:start position:0%
training and the fs of the National
 
06:38:23.948 --> 06:38:23.958 align:start position:0%
Guard If This Were to pass If This Were
 
06:38:26.910 --> 06:38:26.920 align:start position:0%
to pass those High valued assets that
 
06:38:28.830 --> 06:38:28.840 align:start position:0%
the general had previously mentioned
 
06:38:31.590 --> 06:38:31.600 align:start position:0%
would go to other states who would
 
06:38:34.468 --> 06:38:34.478 align:start position:0%
happily take them and in Pete's opinion
 
06:38:38.868 --> 06:38:38.878 align:start position:0%
who did serve in States down south um
 
06:38:41.510 --> 06:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
they value their their military assets
 
06:38:43.230 --> 06:38:43.240 align:start position:0%
at a much greater level than we hear in
 
06:38:45.430 --> 06:38:45.440 align:start position:0%
the National in New Hampshire uh by
 
06:38:48.270 --> 06:38:48.280 align:start position:0%
virtue of the size um as the general
 
06:38:51.350 --> 06:38:51.360 align:start position:0%
appropriately mentioned we're the fourth
 
06:38:54.110 --> 06:38:54.120 align:start position:0%
smallest um those other states which
 
06:38:56.510 --> 06:38:56.520 align:start position:0%
have very large National Guard units
 
06:38:59.030 --> 06:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
would more than happy to take the
 
06:39:01.788 --> 06:39:01.798 align:start position:0%
refueling Wing would be more than happy
 
06:39:04.310 --> 06:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
to take the high Mars uh because they
 
06:39:07.190 --> 06:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
are high valued
 
06:39:09.830 --> 06:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
assets other
 
06:39:11.868 --> 06:39:11.878 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your testimony
 
06:39:13.070 --> 06:39:13.080 align:start position:0%

for three minutes and he has a handout
 
06:39:32.310 --> 06:39:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:08.468 --> 06:40:08.478 align:start position:0%

thank you chairman Moffett members of
 
06:40:12.590 --> 06:40:12.600 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Derek PR um
 
06:40:15.350 --> 06:40:15.360 align:start position:0%
from Derry New Hampshire I'm a uh
 
06:40:16.708 --> 06:40:16.718 align:start position:0%
veteran sergeant of the New Hampshire
 
06:40:18.788 --> 06:40:18.798 align:start position:0%
Army National Guard served for six years
 
06:40:21.388 --> 06:40:21.398 align:start position:0%
there and I'm also on a volunteer basis
 
06:40:23.548 --> 06:40:23.558 align:start position:0%
the state director for bring our troops
 
06:40:27.070 --> 06:40:27.080 align:start position:0%
home which is a veteran run organization
 
06:40:29.350 --> 06:40:29.360 align:start position:0%
that is advocating for this defend the
 
06:40:32.070 --> 06:40:32.080 align:start position:0%
guard legislation um I kind of just want
 
06:40:35.510 --> 06:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
to take my time to just go over uh some
 
06:40:37.708 --> 06:40:37.718 align:start position:0%
of the things that have been uh you know
 
06:40:41.070 --> 06:40:41.080 align:start position:0%
said today um so defend the guard
 
06:40:44.070 --> 06:40:44.080 align:start position:0%
completely within Constitution right
 
06:40:46.388 --> 06:40:46.398 align:start position:0%
Article 1 Section 8 we're trying to come
 
06:40:48.110 --> 06:40:48.120 align:start position:0%
back to the Constitution we've moved so
 
06:40:49.510 --> 06:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
far away from it that's what this
 
06:40:51.788 --> 06:40:51.798 align:start position:0%
legislation is trying to do it does not
 
06:40:54.548 --> 06:40:54.558 align:start position:0%
conflict with the United States
 
06:40:57.030 --> 06:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
Constitution it does not conflict with
 
06:41:01.628 --> 06:41:01.638 align:start position:0%
us code um any reference to defend the
 
06:41:05.230 --> 06:41:05.240 align:start position:0%
guard legislation with 32 activations
 
06:41:07.310 --> 06:41:07.320 align:start position:0%
just ignore it completely right in in
 
06:41:10.548 --> 06:41:10.558 align:start position:0%
the bill text it is specifically uh
 
06:41:12.670 --> 06:41:12.680 align:start position:0%
talking about title 10 so anything about
 
06:41:16.190 --> 06:41:16.200 align:start position:0%
title 32 just completely ignore it um
 
06:41:19.430 --> 06:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
title 10 section 12301 subsection F
 
06:41:20.388 --> 06:41:20.398 align:start position:0%
which we've heard which is that
 
06:41:23.230 --> 06:41:23.240 align:start position:0%
Montgomery amendment that only deals
 
06:41:27.788 --> 06:41:27.798 align:start position:0%
with um uh where was it right here
 
06:41:31.628 --> 06:41:31.638 align:start position:0%
um uh type schedule uh purpose and
 
06:41:34.230 --> 06:41:34.240 align:start position:0%
location of a deployment uh defend the
 
06:41:37.270 --> 06:41:37.280 align:start position:0%
guard does not deal with any of that uh
 
06:41:41.430 --> 06:41:41.440 align:start position:0%
it deals with uh Congress uh not taking
 
06:41:43.110 --> 06:41:43.120 align:start position:0%
action and declaring war in accordance
 
06:41:45.230 --> 06:41:45.240 align:start position:0%
with the United States Constitution so
 
06:41:47.788 --> 06:41:47.798 align:start position:0%
to argue that the government you know
 
06:41:49.628 --> 06:41:49.638 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a say in the matter that is
 
06:41:53.388 --> 06:41:53.398 align:start position:0%
not what title 10 uh section 12 through1
 
06:41:54.990 --> 06:41:55.000 align:start position:0%
says it specifically says that the
 
06:41:58.708 --> 06:41:58.718 align:start position:0%
governor does have a say in this matter
 
06:42:02.708 --> 06:42:02.718 align:start position:0%
um so if if when they introduce the mtom
 
06:42:04.070 --> 06:42:04.080 align:start position:0%
amendment like representative Manion
 
06:42:05.548 --> 06:42:05.558 align:start position:0%
said if they didn't want the governor to
 
06:42:07.110 --> 06:42:07.120 align:start position:0%
have a say then they wouldn't have left
 
06:42:08.948 --> 06:42:08.958 align:start position:0%
it in there um they would have just
 
06:42:11.990 --> 06:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
taken it right out um authorizations for
 
06:42:14.590 --> 06:42:14.600 align:start position:0%
the use of military force um as it's
 
06:42:17.310 --> 06:42:17.320 align:start position:0%
already been said these are turning the
 
06:42:20.628 --> 06:42:20.638 align:start position:0%
whole War making process on its head and
 
06:42:22.910 --> 06:42:22.920 align:start position:0%
Congress abdicating its
 
06:42:26.150 --> 06:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
responsibilities to the executive branch
 
06:42:30.510 --> 06:42:30.520 align:start position:0%
um since the 2001 aumf um 88% of
 
06:42:33.868 --> 06:42:33.878 align:start position:0%
Congress has has lost their seat um and
 
06:42:36.670 --> 06:42:36.680 align:start position:0%
new people have come in um but now these
 
06:42:38.868 --> 06:42:38.878 align:start position:0%
new people where we've passed this AMF
 
06:42:42.590 --> 06:42:42.600 align:start position:0%
it has been repealed and it's been used
 
06:42:45.110 --> 06:42:45.120 align:start position:0%
in in over 20 different
 
06:42:50.230 --> 06:42:50.240 align:start position:0%
countries um over more than you know 25
 
06:42:52.430 --> 06:42:52.440 align:start position:0%
years uh you know there's no
 
06:42:59.468 --> 06:42:59.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:02.150 --> 06:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
um bra which is base realignment
 
06:43:07.468 --> 06:43:07.478 align:start position:0%
enclosure um since uh 2014 the
 
06:43:07.478 --> 06:43:09.350 align:start position:0%
enclosure um since uh 2014 the
ndaa

06:43:09.350 --> 06:43:09.360 align:start position:0%
ndaa
 
06:43:11.910 --> 06:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
um it right here sorry I got my notes a
 
06:43:14.270 --> 06:43:14.280 align:start position:0%
little messed up right
 
06:43:17.310 --> 06:43:17.320 align:start position:0%
now H right here uh National Defense
 
06:43:19.670 --> 06:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
authorization act for fiscal year 2014
 
06:43:21.670 --> 06:43:21.680 align:start position:0%
specifically prohibits authorization of
 
06:43:24.150 --> 06:43:24.160 align:start position:0%
future Brack based realignment enclosure
 
06:43:26.350 --> 06:43:26.360 align:start position:0%
um again another bullying tactic that
 
06:43:28.468 --> 06:43:28.478 align:start position:0%
you shouldn't fold to um closing and
 
06:43:30.788 --> 06:43:30.798 align:start position:0%
moving round guard units uh we put a
 
06:43:32.388 --> 06:43:32.398 align:start position:0%
significant logistical and financial
 
06:43:35.230 --> 06:43:35.240 align:start position:0%
strain on our military it's easy for
 
06:43:36.670 --> 06:43:36.680 align:start position:0%
someone to threaten these things it's
 
06:43:38.990 --> 06:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
another thing to actually do it um and
 
06:43:40.670 --> 06:43:40.680 align:start position:0%
you know that goes along with the
 
06:43:43.310 --> 06:43:43.320 align:start position:0%
funding threats um you know we continue
 
06:43:46.910 --> 06:43:46.920 align:start position:0%
to to to hear these funding threats um
 
06:43:46.920 --> 06:43:47.590 align:start position:0%
to to to hear these funding threats um
you

06:43:47.590 --> 06:43:47.600 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:43:50.948 --> 06:43:50.958 align:start position:0%
know no member of Congress no DOD
 
06:43:54.230 --> 06:43:54.240 align:start position:0%
official has ever said that if a state
 
06:43:56.230 --> 06:43:56.240 align:start position:0%
passes this they will lose funding right
 
06:43:58.468 --> 06:43:58.478 align:start position:0%
the language that is always use is at
 
06:44:01.430 --> 06:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
risk or at Jeopardy right these are
 
06:44:03.590 --> 06:44:03.600 align:start position:0%
coercive measures
 
06:44:06.030 --> 06:44:06.040 align:start position:0%
um defunding a state's national guard
 
06:44:09.628 --> 06:44:09.638 align:start position:0%
would be politically unpopular and would
 
06:44:11.628 --> 06:44:11.638 align:start position:0%
also risk the guard's ability to respond
 
06:44:14.948 --> 06:44:14.958 align:start position:0%
to real national uh and and state
 
06:44:17.310 --> 06:44:17.320 align:start position:0%
emergencies whether that be a military
 
06:44:19.548 --> 06:44:19.558 align:start position:0%
emergency or a natural disaster it would
 
06:44:22.190 --> 06:44:22.200 align:start position:0%
put the guard's capabilities um at R and
 
06:44:24.788 --> 06:44:24.798 align:start position:0%
they they won't do it because we need
 
06:44:27.548 --> 06:44:27.558 align:start position:0%
the National Guard um the National
 
06:44:27.558 --> 06:44:28.750 align:start position:0%
the National Guard um the National
Guard's

06:44:28.750 --> 06:44:28.760 align:start position:0%
Guard's
 
06:44:31.670 --> 06:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
purpose as part of the uh the militia
 
06:44:34.388 --> 06:44:34.398 align:start position:0%
Clause is to repel Invasion suppress
 
06:44:35.830 --> 06:44:35.840 align:start position:0%
Insurrection and uphold the laws of the
 
06:44:38.590 --> 06:44:38.600 align:start position:0%
Union um that's the reason that they
 
06:44:44.468 --> 06:44:44.478 align:start position:0%
that they exist um and so
 
06:44:47.070 --> 06:44:47.080 align:start position:0%
um you know what would be the guard's
 
06:44:49.628 --> 06:44:49.638 align:start position:0%
mission right continue to go along with
 
06:44:51.868 --> 06:44:51.878 align:start position:0%
that uh representative haming way uh
 
06:44:53.628 --> 06:44:53.638 align:start position:0%
what does that look like it looks like
 
06:44:55.070 --> 06:44:55.080 align:start position:0%
what it would look like right now you
 
06:44:57.750 --> 06:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
know ready combat Readiness we do our uh
 
06:45:00.230 --> 06:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
our uh our fire tables oh was uh
 
06:45:02.270 --> 06:45:02.280 align:start position:0%
artillery High Mar's unit we do our fire
 
06:45:04.350 --> 06:45:04.360 align:start position:0%
tables we do it in Littleton we do it in
 
06:45:06.708 --> 06:45:06.718 align:start position:0%
Nashua uh we've done it in Michigan for
 
06:45:09.388 --> 06:45:09.398 align:start position:0%
gring we've done it in Hungary right we
 
06:45:12.430 --> 06:45:12.440 align:start position:0%
can continue training for combat should
 
06:45:16.070 --> 06:45:16.080 align:start position:0%
the need arises um that's what training
 
06:45:17.750 --> 06:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
with the National Guard would look like
 
06:45:20.430 --> 06:45:20.440 align:start position:0%
before this bill and after this bill
 
06:45:21.948 --> 06:45:21.958 align:start position:0%
this isn't saying that we'll never go
 
06:45:24.670 --> 06:45:24.680 align:start position:0%
into a combat ever again this is saying
 
06:45:27.510 --> 06:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
that when Congress does its job and gets
 
06:45:27.520 --> 06:45:29.230 align:start position:0%
that when Congress does its job and gets
fully

06:45:29.230 --> 06:45:29.240 align:start position:0%
fully
 
06:45:32.150 --> 06:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
behind the National Guard then New
 
06:45:33.868 --> 06:45:33.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire will send
 
06:45:35.788 --> 06:45:35.798 align:start position:0%
uh our troops and again this is
 
06:45:39.310 --> 06:45:39.320 align:start position:0%
referring to overseas combat um I
 
06:45:41.430 --> 06:45:41.440 align:start position:0%
believe it was representative manle bomb
 
06:45:45.830 --> 06:45:45.840 align:start position:0%
you asked about um uh the refueling um
 
06:45:48.230 --> 06:45:48.240 align:start position:0%
you know overseas combat combat being
 
06:45:51.150 --> 06:45:51.160 align:start position:0%
shooting at or getting shot at so
 
06:45:53.190 --> 06:45:53.200 align:start position:0%
refueling you know wouldn't fall into
 
06:45:56.070 --> 06:45:56.080 align:start position:0%
you know that definition of combat um
 
06:45:58.150 --> 06:45:58.160 align:start position:0%
you know I think you also representative
 
06:45:59.830 --> 06:45:59.840 align:start position:0%
man bomb you said you know what other
 
06:46:03.230 --> 06:46:03.240 align:start position:0%
states are doing things that might be
 
06:46:04.788 --> 06:46:04.798 align:start position:0%
contradictory to what the federal
 
06:46:07.628 --> 06:46:07.638 align:start position:0%
government wants um I mean like it's
 
06:46:10.270 --> 06:46:10.280 align:start position:0%
been saying seat belt um also cannabis
 
06:46:11.788 --> 06:46:11.798 align:start position:0%
legalization that would be like another
 
06:46:15.468 --> 06:46:15.478 align:start position:0%
thing that's going around the country um
 
06:46:18.910 --> 06:46:18.920 align:start position:0%
you know it's the general mades he
 
06:46:21.230 --> 06:46:21.240 align:start position:0%
referred you know that this is not the
 
06:46:24.310 --> 06:46:24.320 align:start position:0%
body to make these kinds of decisions uh
 
06:46:26.110 --> 06:46:26.120 align:start position:0%
we've already heard the Daniel Webster
 
06:46:28.990 --> 06:46:29.000 align:start position:0%
quote um that it is our solemn duty to
 
06:46:31.070 --> 06:46:31.080 align:start position:0%
actually do this right here but you know
 
06:46:34.788 --> 06:46:34.798 align:start position:0%
we also you read Federalist Papers um
 
06:46:36.590 --> 06:46:36.600 align:start position:0%
you know the Federalist Papers was a
 
06:46:38.910 --> 06:46:38.920 align:start position:0%
real discussion between the Federalist
 
06:46:40.110 --> 06:46:40.120 align:start position:0%
and the Anti-Federalist before the
 
06:46:42.990 --> 06:46:43.000 align:start position:0%
ratification of the US Constitution and
 
06:46:45.150 --> 06:46:45.160 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of concerns brought up
 
06:46:47.310 --> 06:46:47.320 align:start position:0%
and our founding fathers The Architects
 
06:46:49.670 --> 06:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
of the US
 
06:46:52.910 --> 06:46:52.920 align:start position:0%
Constitution they specifically said that
 
06:46:54.990 --> 06:46:55.000 align:start position:0%
if the federal government starts acting
 
06:46:59.910 --> 06:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
in ways that are outside of you know the
 
06:47:01.948 --> 06:47:01.958 align:start position:0%
ideals of the Revolution that they just
 
06:47:05.070 --> 06:47:05.080 align:start position:0%
fought outside of the Constitution then
 
06:47:07.948 --> 06:47:07.958 align:start position:0%
the states should and it is their duty
 
06:47:11.788 --> 06:47:11.798 align:start position:0%
to act to bring Congress back to the
 
06:47:14.548 --> 06:47:14.558 align:start position:0%
Republic uh should it move away this
 
06:47:16.230 --> 06:47:16.240 align:start position:0%
this was the conversation that was going
 
06:47:18.350 --> 06:47:18.360 align:start position:0%
this is what our Founders said um you
 
06:47:21.310 --> 06:47:21.320 align:start position:0%
know we've talked about uh Madison uh
 
06:47:25.070 --> 06:47:25.080 align:start position:0%
who talked about you know uh the
 
06:47:27.270 --> 06:47:27.280 align:start position:0%
executive branch being most prone to war
 
06:47:28.430 --> 06:47:28.440 align:start position:0%
you know a lot of that has to do with
 
06:47:29.510 --> 06:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
you know like I said they just fought
 
06:47:31.830 --> 06:47:31.840 align:start position:0%
the revolution um you had the French and
 
06:47:34.948 --> 06:47:34.958 align:start position:0%
Indian War where the crown had robbed
 
06:47:38.230 --> 06:47:38.240 align:start position:0%
the treasury and uh through you know all
 
06:47:41.430 --> 06:47:41.440 align:start position:0%
these wars and so when they wrote the
 
06:47:43.310 --> 06:47:43.320 align:start position:0%
article one section 8 putting War Powers
 
06:47:45.190 --> 06:47:45.200 align:start position:0%
with the people they specifically wanted
 
06:47:47.388 --> 06:47:47.398 align:start position:0%
to keep War away from the executive most
 
06:47:52.230 --> 06:47:52.240 align:start position:0%
prone to it um and um well I mean what's
 
06:47:54.310 --> 06:47:54.320 align:start position:0%
the state of our treasury uh since we've
 
06:47:56.830 --> 06:47:56.840 align:start position:0%
kind of moved away from following our
 
06:47:58.670 --> 06:47:58.680 align:start position:0%
constitutional uh War making
 
06:48:01.948 --> 06:48:01.958 align:start position:0%
responsibilities um it hasn't been great
 
06:48:05.868 --> 06:48:05.878 align:start position:0%
um Purp versus DOD um if you read the
 
06:48:09.388 --> 06:48:09.398 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court summary only relates
 
06:48:12.350 --> 06:48:12.360 align:start position:0%
to training uh has says nothing about
 
06:48:15.430 --> 06:48:15.440 align:start position:0%
combat it only says training so perp
 
06:48:17.468 --> 06:48:17.478 align:start position:0%
versus dad has nothing to do with this
 
06:48:19.750 --> 06:48:19.760 align:start position:0%
bill this bill doesn't say that we can't
 
06:48:22.230 --> 06:48:22.240 align:start position:0%
you know go over to Hungary or El
 
06:48:25.310 --> 06:48:25.320 align:start position:0%
Salvador or Cabo Verde uh to continue to
 
06:48:27.788 --> 06:48:27.798 align:start position:0%
train with our allies um so it is not in
 
06:48:30.270 --> 06:48:30.280 align:start position:0%
conflict with uh perit versus
 
06:48:34.750 --> 06:48:34.760 align:start position:0%
DOD um widespread support for this bill
 
06:48:35.910 --> 06:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
uh it's already been mentioned this is
 
06:48:38.948 --> 06:48:38.958 align:start position:0%
in the nhgop party platform this bill
 
06:48:41.548 --> 06:48:41.558 align:start position:0%
has been supported by the ACLU of New
 
06:48:43.708 --> 06:48:43.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as well as tons of other ACLU
 
06:48:46.350 --> 06:48:46.360 align:start position:0%
chapters around the country it's also in
 
06:48:50.150 --> 06:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
uh multiple other uh State GOP uh party
 
06:48:54.750 --> 06:48:54.760 align:start position:0%
platforms um last year the Texas GOP put
 
06:48:57.388 --> 06:48:57.398 align:start position:0%
the question of supporting defend the
 
06:49:01.910 --> 06:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
guard in the uh uh during the na the
 
06:49:05.230 --> 06:49:05.240 align:start position:0%
Texas GOP primary as a ballot
 
06:49:08.670 --> 06:49:08.680 align:start position:0%
proposition 84% of Texas GOP voters
 
06:49:10.750 --> 06:49:10.760 align:start position:0%
supported this bill so that's 1.8
 
06:49:13.590 --> 06:49:13.600 align:start position:0%
million people voted for this measure
 
06:49:16.910 --> 06:49:16.920 align:start position:0%
they want the Texas GOP to pass this
 
06:49:19.270 --> 06:49:19.280 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
06:49:19.280 --> 06:49:21.670 align:start position:0%
kind of
legislation

testified today talk about the
 
06:50:46.070 --> 06:50:46.080 align:start position:0%
constitutionality of this bill and
 
06:50:48.750 --> 06:50:48.760 align:start position:0%
candidly I am not a constitutional
 
06:50:51.230 --> 06:50:51.240 align:start position:0%
scholar um so when you say that this
 
06:50:53.350 --> 06:50:53.360 align:start position:0%
bill does not conflict with the US
 
06:50:55.830 --> 06:50:55.840 align:start position:0%
Constitution is that based on your own
 
06:50:58.510 --> 06:50:58.520 align:start position:0%
reading of the Constitution or from
 
06:51:00.948 --> 06:51:00.958 align:start position:0%
experts in constitutional
 
06:51:03.708 --> 06:51:03.718 align:start position:0%
law uh my reading
 
06:51:06.468 --> 06:51:06.478 align:start position:0%
constitutional Scholars and also the
 
06:51:08.590 --> 06:51:08.600 align:start position:0%
opinions of The Architects of the
 
06:51:10.548 --> 06:51:10.558 align:start position:0%
Constitution founding follows James

you representative
 
06:51:17.910 --> 06:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
flos so I've been taking a list of stuff
 
06:51:19.388 --> 06:51:19.398 align:start position:0%
I need to look up before I make up my
 
06:51:21.510 --> 06:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
mind on this um when you said you were
 
06:51:24.190 --> 06:51:24.200 align:start position:0%
talking about Brack and then you said
 
06:51:25.270 --> 06:51:25.280 align:start position:0%
something that sounded like it might
 
06:51:28.430 --> 06:51:28.440 align:start position:0%
have been statutory language or a quote
 
06:51:30.948 --> 06:51:30.958 align:start position:0%
or something afterwards yeah so Brack is
 
06:51:33.590 --> 06:51:33.600 align:start position:0%
base realignment enclosure right and the
 
06:51:37.070 --> 06:51:37.080 align:start position:0%
2014 National Defense authorization act
 
06:51:40.230 --> 06:51:40.240 align:start position:0%
uh permanently bans future
 
06:51:45.468 --> 06:51:45.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:48.468 --> 06:51:48.478 align:start position:0%
you it's my turn representative uh I
 
06:51:51.830 --> 06:51:51.840 align:start position:0%
actually a TW for I seem to hear clearly
 
06:51:53.990 --> 06:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
from you that the incoming likely
 
06:51:56.948 --> 06:51:56.958 align:start position:0%
incoming secretary of defense is all on
 
06:52:02.030 --> 06:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
board with this type of measure uh am I
 
06:52:04.430 --> 06:52:04.440 align:start position:0%
hearing you correctly that is very
 
06:52:06.670 --> 06:52:06.680 align:start position:0%
correct yes and it you know it's very
 
06:52:09.430 --> 06:52:09.440 align:start position:0%
you know I think as of today he has the
 
06:52:11.830 --> 06:52:11.840 align:start position:0%
votes and I think you know even some
 
06:52:13.990 --> 06:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
democrat Senators right I I I'm assuming
 
06:52:17.190 --> 06:52:17.200 align:start position:0%
that he's going to be a confirmed so
 
06:52:19.750 --> 06:52:19.760 align:start position:0%
assuming that so support we met him with
 
06:52:21.868 --> 06:52:21.878 align:start position:0%
him for multiple hours that's a very
 
06:52:24.230 --> 06:52:24.240 align:start position:0%
powerful statement and you're you're
 
06:52:26.510 --> 06:52:26.520 align:start position:0%
confident in saying that the SE def is
 
06:52:30.430 --> 06:52:30.440 align:start position:0%
for this yes that is correct okay and my
 
06:52:33.190 --> 06:52:33.200 align:start position:0%
second question uh has to do I'm looking
 
06:52:34.948 --> 06:52:34.958 align:start position:0%
at the handout that you gave us again
 
06:52:36.990 --> 06:52:37.000 align:start position:0%
thank thanks to anyone who takes time to
 
06:52:38.708 --> 06:52:38.718 align:start position:0%
give us a handout which he gives us a
 
06:52:41.788 --> 06:52:41.798 align:start position:0%
chance to review uh the congressman from
 
06:52:44.350 --> 06:52:44.360 align:start position:0%
Arizona wrote or said that uh the
 
06:52:45.788 --> 06:52:45.798 align:start position:0%
federal government needs a well-prepared
 
06:52:49.150 --> 06:52:49.160 align:start position:0%
guard the house would never uh cut
 
06:52:52.708 --> 06:52:52.718 align:start position:0%
funding for the guard the house controls
 
06:52:56.070 --> 06:52:56.080 align:start position:0%

06:52:59.150 --> 06:52:59.160 align:start position:0%
that other people a lot of people last
 
06:53:00.830 --> 06:53:00.840 align:start position:0%
year this year have said that they would
 
06:53:05.110 --> 06:53:05.120 align:start position:0%
never dare defund us uh I I keep hearing
 
06:53:06.830 --> 06:53:06.840 align:start position:0%
that but I also heard the the the
 
06:53:11.030 --> 06:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
colonel your predecessor who spoke uh uh
 
06:53:13.910 --> 06:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
said that they would and uh the agitant
 
06:53:16.750 --> 06:53:16.760 align:start position:0%
general said that our asset assets would
 
06:53:20.788 --> 06:53:20.798 align:start position:0%
be moved uh if if we if this passed it
 
06:53:22.750 --> 06:53:22.760 align:start position:0%
it sounds like our guard would be
 
06:53:25.590 --> 06:53:25.600 align:start position:0%
eviscerated so how it's it's a little
 
06:53:27.230 --> 06:53:27.240 align:start position:0%
bit to me S of a little bit like a game
 
06:53:30.070 --> 06:53:30.080 align:start position:0%
of chicken uh you know you're saying if
 
06:53:33.110 --> 06:53:33.120 align:start position:0%
this passes uh they wouldn't there cut
 
06:53:36.990 --> 06:53:37.000 align:start position:0%
our funding and I how confident are you
 
06:53:38.990 --> 06:53:39.000 align:start position:0%
that that would be the case are you are
 
06:53:41.948 --> 06:53:41.958 align:start position:0%
you 100% confident that I am 100%
 
06:53:44.310 --> 06:53:44.320 align:start position:0%
confident so you know liking my hand out
 
06:53:47.150 --> 06:53:47.160 align:start position:0%
we got multiple members of Congress and
 
06:53:49.788 --> 06:53:49.798 align:start position:0%
you know representative goar and uh
 
06:53:52.430 --> 06:53:52.440 align:start position:0%
Congressman Massie they went around and
 
06:53:54.350 --> 06:53:54.360 align:start position:0%
asked all their colleagues about this
 
06:53:57.628 --> 06:53:57.638 align:start position:0%
bill would if this happened would you be
 
06:54:00.190 --> 06:54:00.200 align:start position:0%
in favor of voting of defunding Estates
 
06:54:01.948 --> 06:54:01.958 align:start position:0%
no member of Congress would it's
 
06:54:03.788 --> 06:54:03.798 align:start position:0%
political suicide no one would ever dare
 
06:54:06.350 --> 06:54:06.360 align:start position:0%
do that um and also one of my handouts
 
06:54:09.910 --> 06:54:09.920 align:start position:0%
is actually from uh Kansas um and their
 
06:54:12.590 --> 06:54:12.600 align:start position:0%
fiscal report from their agitant General
 
06:54:14.070 --> 06:54:14.080 align:start position:0%
uh who said that there would be no
 
06:54:16.910 --> 06:54:16.920 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact so we've got one adant
 
06:54:18.990 --> 06:54:19.000 align:start position:0%
General saying one thing another ad
 
06:54:20.310 --> 06:54:20.320 align:start position:0%
General saying a different thing we get
 
06:54:23.070 --> 06:54:23.080 align:start position:0%
member of Congress saying that you know
 
06:54:24.310 --> 06:54:24.320 align:start position:0%
it won't be
 
06:54:26.548 --> 06:54:26.558 align:start position:0%
defunded I think we can just throw this
 
06:54:29.670 --> 06:54:29.680 align:start position:0%
funding concern out the window cuz it's
 
06:54:34.110 --> 06:54:34.120 align:start position:0%
not clear we just need to focus us on
 
06:54:37.310 --> 06:54:37.320 align:start position:0%
the Constitution uh what's been going on
 
06:54:40.590 --> 06:54:40.600 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of our foreign policy um in
 
06:54:44.990 --> 06:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
terms of uh losing our morality as a
 
06:54:46.788 --> 06:54:46.798 align:start position:0%
nation as well as losing Financial
 
06:54:49.628 --> 06:54:49.638 align:start position:0%
stability in this country because of our
 
06:54:52.910 --> 06:54:52.920 align:start position:0%
conduct um and you know it's up to to
 
06:54:54.990 --> 06:54:55.000 align:start position:0%
this body it you know like that Daniel
 
06:54:57.270 --> 06:54:57.280 align:start position:0%
Webster quote it's up to this body to to
 
06:55:00.110 --> 06:55:00.120 align:start position:0%
protect our National Guard and to make
 
06:55:01.788 --> 06:55:01.798 align:start position:0%
sure that Congress does its job first
 
06:55:03.670 --> 06:55:03.680 align:start position:0%
before we send s them into Harm's Way
 
06:55:07.150 --> 06:55:07.160 align:start position:0%
okay represent manal bomb and repres
 
06:55:09.030 --> 06:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
represent cyber do you have hand up no
 
06:55:11.388 --> 06:55:11.398 align:start position:0%
she had it up first well it's your
 
06:55:16.388 --> 06:55:16.398 align:start position:0%
turn oh okay um no I just a question um
 
06:55:20.270 --> 06:55:20.280 align:start position:0%
about the this particular fiscal note um
 
06:55:22.070 --> 06:55:22.080 align:start position:0%
just I would feel more comfortable
 
06:55:24.350 --> 06:55:24.360 align:start position:0%
actually seeing one from this one is
 
06:55:26.510 --> 06:55:26.520 align:start position:0%
just it looks like the adjunct General
 
06:55:30.070 --> 06:55:30.080 align:start position:0%
is cced on this message after it has
 
06:55:32.830 --> 06:55:32.840 align:start position:0%
been written up and sent it is from the
 
06:55:35.070 --> 06:55:35.080 align:start position:0%
Kansas Division of the budget but it's
 
06:55:36.388 --> 06:55:36.398 align:start position:0%
essentially kind of like I'm guessing
 
06:55:40.110 --> 06:55:40.120 align:start position:0%
our LBA because it's a letter from the
 
06:55:43.350 --> 06:55:43.360 align:start position:0%
chairperson um on the senate committee
 
06:55:45.310 --> 06:55:45.320 align:start position:0%
that's our you know similar committee
 
06:55:48.628 --> 06:55:48.638 align:start position:0%
there whatever but for their Senate so I
 
06:55:51.430 --> 06:55:51.440 align:start position:0%
would actually like to see that and
 
06:55:53.070 --> 06:55:53.080 align:start position:0%
possibly I'll try to get in touch with
 
06:55:55.070 --> 06:55:55.080 align:start position:0%
them how about that actually get their
 
06:55:56.788 --> 06:55:56.798 align:start position:0%
opinion on that and the similarities
 
06:55:59.030 --> 06:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
between our situation sure okay I I
 
06:56:00.708 --> 06:56:00.718 align:start position:0%
think you know like it says highlighted
 
06:56:02.350 --> 06:56:02.360 align:start position:0%
there right the ad General's Department
 
06:56:03.788 --> 06:56:03.798 align:start position:0%
states that the enactment of their
 
06:56:05.670 --> 06:56:05.680 align:start position:0%
version of this bill would not have a
 
06:56:08.030 --> 06:56:08.040 align:start position:0%
fiscal effect yeah I would just have
 
06:56:09.548 --> 06:56:09.558 align:start position:0%
feel more comfortable hearing it from
 
06:56:11.510 --> 06:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
them sure directly thank
 
06:56:16.788 --> 06:56:16.798 align:start position:0%
you manom uh thank you Mr chairman so um
 
06:56:19.230 --> 06:56:19.240 align:start position:0%
you mentioned congressman goar and
 
06:56:21.910 --> 06:56:21.920 align:start position:0%
Massie have noted that there wouldn't be
 
06:56:24.030 --> 06:56:24.040 align:start position:0%
defunding for pass to such a bill in a
 
06:56:26.548 --> 06:56:26.558 align:start position:0%
state I'm curious what New Hampshire's
 
06:56:28.910 --> 06:56:28.920 align:start position:0%
Federal delegation has said about this
 
06:56:31.990 --> 06:56:32.000 align:start position:0%
bill I haven't heard anything from them
 
06:56:36.150 --> 06:56:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:40.270 --> 06:56:40.280 align:start position:0%
right other questions uh repr
 
06:56:43.868 --> 06:56:43.878 align:start position:0%
Hemingway thank you chair uh welcome and
 
06:56:45.910 --> 06:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for your service um so you
 
06:56:49.070 --> 06:56:49.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned Brack and bra does that
 
06:56:50.750 --> 06:56:50.760 align:start position:0%
include National Guard units because I
 
06:56:53.510 --> 06:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
don't believe so I think that's only for
 
06:56:55.070 --> 06:56:55.080 align:start position:0%
for the uh
 
06:56:58.070 --> 06:56:58.080 align:start position:0%
Federal I I'm couldn't answer that
 
06:56:59.548 --> 06:56:59.558 align:start position:0%
question I imagine that Brack would
 
06:57:02.948 --> 06:57:02.958 align:start position:0%
include like things like peas
 
06:57:05.788 --> 06:57:05.798 align:start position:0%
but p is p is kind of a National Guard
 
06:57:09.388 --> 06:57:09.398 align:start position:0%
unit it's an air guard right and uh I
 
06:57:11.070 --> 06:57:11.080 align:start position:0%
can tell you that within New Hampshire
 
06:57:13.510 --> 06:57:13.520 align:start position:0%
that they have closed down bases and
 
06:57:17.070 --> 06:57:17.080 align:start position:0%
realigned forces to meet the to meet the
 
06:57:18.990 --> 06:57:19.000 align:start position:0%
uh training requirements are the are the
 
06:57:23.110 --> 06:57:23.120 align:start position:0%
mission so Brack in my opinion does not
 
06:57:27.350 --> 06:57:27.360 align:start position:0%
qualify as part of a National Guard uh
 
06:57:32.190 --> 06:57:32.200 align:start position:0%
regulation okay follow up follow up uh
 
06:57:34.948 --> 06:57:34.958 align:start position:0%
the other thing is and I I do believe
 
06:57:36.990 --> 06:57:37.000 align:start position:0%
you say you continue doing training with
 
06:57:38.830 --> 06:57:38.840 align:start position:0%
the himars and other things and in
 
06:57:40.468 --> 06:57:40.478 align:start position:0%
different areas yes I've been there done
 
06:57:44.388 --> 06:57:44.398 align:start position:0%
that and um the only thing is that there
 
06:57:44.398 --> 06:57:45.590 align:start position:0%
that and um the only thing is that there
is

06:57:45.590 --> 06:57:45.600 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:57:49.270 --> 06:57:49.280 align:start position:0%
nothing that will take more serious and
 
06:57:51.030 --> 06:57:51.040 align:start position:0%
than someone that's actually going over
 
06:57:52.388 --> 06:57:52.398 align:start position:0%
there to use the equipment that they've
 
06:57:55.110 --> 06:57:55.120 align:start position:0%
been trained on that is what people are
 
06:57:58.510 --> 06:57:58.520 align:start position:0%
are look forward to and not everyone a
 
06:58:02.990 --> 06:58:03.000 align:start position:0%
agreed um but you you want to have a
 
06:58:04.350 --> 06:58:04.360 align:start position:0%
purpose for that mission and when you
 
06:58:07.350 --> 06:58:07.360 align:start position:0%
say that you may the only reason why you
 
06:58:09.670 --> 06:58:09.680 align:start position:0%
don't get called up is by the by
 
06:58:09.680 --> 06:58:12.310 align:start position:0%
don't get called up is by the by
Congress

06:58:12.310 --> 06:58:12.320 align:start position:0%
Congress
 
06:58:14.788 --> 06:58:14.798 align:start position:0%
and you haven't been called up in by
 
06:58:17.110 --> 06:58:17.120 align:start position:0%
Congress since
 
06:58:19.388 --> 06:58:19.398 align:start position:0%
1942 I remember when I came under the
 
06:58:21.270 --> 06:58:21.280 align:start position:0%
guard back in the 90s we were running
 
06:58:23.830 --> 06:58:23.840 align:start position:0%
around in equipment from the from the
 
06:58:27.310 --> 06:58:27.320 align:start position:0%
60s and we went overseas that equipment
 
06:58:29.230 --> 06:58:29.240 align:start position:0%
went overseas twice once with Desert
 
06:58:33.030 --> 06:58:33.040 align:start position:0%
Storm and once with Iraq um oif2
 
06:58:37.430 --> 06:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
thin skin no armor in a combat zone but
 
06:58:38.990 --> 06:58:39.000 align:start position:0%
when we got back because he kept that
 
06:58:41.310 --> 06:58:41.320 align:start position:0%
equipment there because it was no good
 
06:58:42.948 --> 06:58:42.958 align:start position:0%
we got our brand new equipment and
 
06:58:45.110 --> 06:58:45.120 align:start position:0%
reason being is because we went on a
 
06:58:48.750 --> 06:58:48.760 align:start position:0%
mission we defended our country and this
 
06:58:51.030 --> 06:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
is why we got the money so you
 
06:58:53.948 --> 06:58:53.958 align:start position:0%
you sit there and say 100% that the
 
06:58:55.910 --> 06:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
funding is not going to be
 
06:58:58.948 --> 06:58:58.958 align:start position:0%
denied I I kind of
 
06:59:03.070 --> 06:59:03.080 align:start position:0%
differ okay I mean so I mean training I
 
06:59:06.388 --> 06:59:06.398 align:start position:0%
I'm not willing to throw away uh lives
 
06:59:08.788 --> 06:59:08.798 align:start position:0%
of national Guardsmen
 
06:59:11.868 --> 06:59:11.878 align:start position:0%
or uh throw the constitution in the
 
06:59:15.430 --> 06:59:15.440 align:start position:0%
trash bin uh just for experience right I
 
06:59:17.468 --> 06:59:17.478 align:start position:0%
think I don't think anyone should
 
06:59:20.510 --> 06:59:20.520 align:start position:0%
experience combat um I think we can
 
06:59:23.590 --> 06:59:23.600 align:start position:0%
train to it uh to meet it if the time
 
06:59:25.670 --> 06:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
comes and I don't think that this bill
 
06:59:28.910 --> 06:59:28.920 align:start position:0%
conflicts with that um but I don't think
 
06:59:31.590 --> 06:59:31.600 align:start position:0%
that we should be throwing lives away or
 
06:59:34.388 --> 06:59:34.398 align:start position:0%
the con stitution uh just for the
 
06:59:36.150 --> 06:59:36.160 align:start position:0%
experience of
 
06:59:39.270 --> 06:59:39.280 align:start position:0%

07:00:29.548 --> 07:00:29.558 align:start position:0%
passed the New Hampshire House of
 
07:00:32.590 --> 07:00:32.600 align:start position:0%
Representatives last term um um and was
 
07:00:34.270 --> 07:00:34.280 align:start position:0%
honored to help in that
 
07:00:37.030 --> 07:00:37.040 align:start position:0%
endeavor it seems like a lifetime ago
 
07:00:38.468 --> 07:00:38.478 align:start position:0%
that I was enlisted in the Armory
 
07:00:39.628 --> 07:00:39.638 align:start position:0%
Reserve in
 
07:00:42.190 --> 07:00:42.200 align:start position:0%
1991 uh and due to my Massachusetts
 
07:00:44.590 --> 07:00:44.600 align:start position:0%
reserve unit that actually uh
 
07:00:47.388 --> 07:00:47.398 align:start position:0%
deactivated after I was trained under my
 
07:00:50.110 --> 07:00:50.120 align:start position:0%
first M which was a 77 whiskey I was a
 
07:00:52.788 --> 07:00:52.798 align:start position:0%
water dog in which I missed the first
 
07:00:55.990 --> 07:00:56.000 align:start position:0%
Iraq deployment only by two weeks um
 
07:00:58.190 --> 07:00:58.200 align:start position:0%
because my unit wasn't fully trained it
 
07:01:01.590 --> 07:01:01.600 align:start position:0%
wasn't in a state of Readiness yet um I
 
07:01:03.230 --> 07:01:03.240 align:start position:0%
was actually transferred into the
 
07:01:05.590 --> 07:01:05.600 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Army National Guard for
 
07:01:08.150 --> 07:01:08.160 align:start position:0%
the next 6 to S years and retrained
 
07:01:10.670 --> 07:01:10.680 align:start position:0%
under a new MOS so that was in
 
07:01:14.230 --> 07:01:14.240 align:start position:0%
1992 um I was a 94 Bravo at that point
 
07:01:16.830 --> 07:01:16.840 align:start position:0%
uh NBC decontamination unit and
 
07:01:19.388 --> 07:01:19.398 align:start position:0%
subsequently I missed the next Iraq
 
07:01:22.150 --> 07:01:22.160 align:start position:0%
deployment by a very slim margin of time
 
07:01:22.160 --> 07:01:22.948 align:start position:0%
deployment by a very slim margin of time
as

07:01:22.948 --> 07:01:22.958 align:start position:0%
as
 
07:01:26.030 --> 07:01:26.040 align:start position:0%
well the amount of Massachusetts Army
 
07:01:29.628 --> 07:01:29.638 align:start position:0%
National Guard injuries that I witnessed
 
07:01:34.270 --> 07:01:34.280 align:start position:0%
firsthand um in 19 1992 and 1993 alone
 
07:01:34.280 --> 07:01:35.270 align:start position:0%
firsthand um in 19 1992 and 1993 alone
were

07:01:35.270 --> 07:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
were
 
07:01:38.150 --> 07:01:38.160 align:start position:0%
atrocious we all know what took place
 
07:01:40.868 --> 07:01:40.878 align:start position:0%
over multiple conflicts under multiple
 
07:01:44.548 --> 07:01:44.558 align:start position:0%
presidencies all under false pretenses
 
07:01:44.558 --> 07:01:45.548 align:start position:0%
presidencies all under false pretenses
US

07:01:45.548 --> 07:01:45.558 align:start position:0%
US
 
07:01:48.468 --> 07:01:48.478 align:start position:0%
security you know excuses weapons of
 
07:01:51.750 --> 07:01:51.760 align:start position:0%
mass destruction Etc but most
 
07:01:54.830 --> 07:01:54.840 align:start position:0%
importantly um all really to line the
 
07:01:57.270 --> 07:01:57.280 align:start position:0%
highest level of people's pockets from
 
07:02:00.708 --> 07:02:00.718 align:start position:0%
political powers to NOS to corporations
 
07:02:03.910 --> 07:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
in regards with oil and more with
 
07:02:05.830 --> 07:02:05.840 align:start position:0%
everything happening in our country
 
07:02:08.190 --> 07:02:08.200 align:start position:0%
right now the focus I believe needs to
 
07:02:10.750 --> 07:02:10.760 align:start position:0%
be on the United States of America and
 
07:02:13.150 --> 07:02:13.160 align:start position:0%
our state um if you just look at what's
 
07:02:16.628 --> 07:02:16.638 align:start position:0%
going on um in California the horrible
 
07:02:18.830 --> 07:02:18.840 align:start position:0%
fires and and if we didn't have our
 
07:02:20.590 --> 07:02:20.600 align:start position:0%
National Guard because they were out
 
07:02:23.388 --> 07:02:23.398 align:start position:0%
fighting some endless war that's a
 
07:02:26.468 --> 07:02:26.478 align:start position:0%
problem and I believe that we have to
 
07:02:29.070 --> 07:02:29.080 align:start position:0%
come first so if you just look at the
 
07:02:32.070 --> 07:02:32.080 align:start position:0%
three operations in Iraq which included
 
07:02:35.070 --> 07:02:35.080 align:start position:0%
operation Iraqi Freedom operation New
 
07:02:37.868 --> 07:02:37.878 align:start position:0%
Dawn and operation inherent resolve uh
 
07:02:41.430 --> 07:02:41.440 align:start position:0%
4,600 US troops died the war officially
 
07:02:44.430 --> 07:02:44.440 align:start position:0%
ended in December 15th of
 
07:02:47.270 --> 07:02:47.280 align:start position:0%
2011 but the majority of deaths actually
 
07:02:50.030 --> 07:02:50.040 align:start position:0%
occurred between 2009 and
 
07:02:53.830 --> 07:02:53.840 align:start position:0%
2012 48% of those deaths were caused by
 
07:02:55.388 --> 07:02:55.398 align:start position:0%
explosive devices
 
07:03:00.868 --> 07:03:00.878 align:start position:0%
IEDs um my very a very good friend um
 
07:03:02.670 --> 07:03:02.680 align:start position:0%
that I went to high school with with was
 
07:03:04.388 --> 07:03:04.398 align:start position:0%
blown up by one of those
 
07:03:31.830 --> 07:03:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:34.230 --> 07:03:34.240 align:start position:0%
War without a formal declaration of war
 
07:03:37.788 --> 07:03:37.798 align:start position:0%
from commer stems from legal ethical and
 
07:03:40.070 --> 07:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
practical considerations tied to the
 
07:03:43.388 --> 07:03:43.398 align:start position:0%
rule of law the separation of powers and
 
07:03:45.670 --> 07:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
Democratic principles and here's why it
 
07:03:48.190 --> 07:03:48.200 align:start position:0%
matters Constitution Authority article
 
07:03:51.430 --> 07:03:51.440 align:start position:0%
one section 8 is crystal clear and every
 
07:03:53.670 --> 07:03:53.680 align:start position:0%
single one of us here took an oath to
 
07:03:55.670 --> 07:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Constitution and the
 
07:03:58.910 --> 07:03:58.920 align:start position:0%
US Constitution that's it that's clear
 
07:04:01.388 --> 07:04:01.398 align:start position:0%
as day this ensures that the decision to
 
07:04:03.670 --> 07:04:03.680 align:start position:0%
go to War reflects the collective will
 
07:04:07.350 --> 07:04:07.360 align:start position:0%
of the people through their elected
 
07:04:10.628 --> 07:04:10.638 align:start position:0%
representatives I don't work for myself
 
07:04:12.548 --> 07:04:12.558 align:start position:0%
I work for the New Hampshire citizens
 
07:04:14.830 --> 07:04:14.840 align:start position:0%
and we all do and that's where we should
 
07:04:18.270 --> 07:04:18.280 align:start position:0%
be taking everything from the War Powers
 
07:04:22.030 --> 07:04:22.040 align:start position:0%
Resolution of 1973 was enacted to preses
 
07:04:24.548 --> 07:04:24.558 align:start position:0%
this was really because presidents were
 
07:04:27.110 --> 07:04:27.120 align:start position:0%
basically unilaterally just going off
 
07:04:28.910 --> 07:04:28.920 align:start position:0%
and that was put in place to present
 
07:04:30.910 --> 07:04:30.920 align:start position:0%
presidents from unilaterally engaging in
 
07:04:33.430 --> 07:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
prolonged milit Ary conflicts without
 
07:04:33.440 --> 07:04:35.030 align:start position:0%
prolonged milit Ary conflicts without
consulting

07:04:35.030 --> 07:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
consulting
 
07:04:37.788 --> 07:04:37.798 align:start position:0%
Congress it allows limited Military
 
07:04:40.548 --> 07:04:40.558 align:start position:0%
action we know that that has that's far
 
07:04:44.270 --> 07:04:44.280 align:start position:0%
gone now in emergencies or prolonged
 
07:04:46.310 --> 07:04:46.320 align:start position:0%
deployments without Congressional
 
07:04:50.310 --> 07:04:50.320 align:start position:0%
approval and of course um so that we
 
07:04:52.150 --> 07:04:52.160 align:start position:0%
don't have any more violations of
 
07:04:54.910 --> 07:04:54.920 align:start position:0%
constitutional principles two prevention
 
07:04:57.868 --> 07:04:57.878 align:start position:0%
of e executive Outreach accountability
 
07:04:59.670 --> 07:04:59.680 align:start position:0%
to the people that's probably one of the
 
07:05:01.910 --> 07:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
most important things um because we are
 
07:05:04.788 --> 07:05:04.798 align:start position:0%
all accountable to the voters declaring
 
07:05:06.868 --> 07:05:06.878 align:start position:0%
war is a serious decision we know that
 
07:05:08.388 --> 07:05:08.398 align:start position:0%
it leads to tons of loss of life
 
07:05:09.788 --> 07:05:09.798 align:start position:0%
billions of dollars and so many
 
07:05:12.788 --> 07:05:12.798 align:start position:0%
long-term cons uh consequences by
 
07:05:14.548 --> 07:05:14.558 align:start position:0%
requiring Congressional approval the
 
07:05:16.388 --> 07:05:16.398 align:start position:0%
Constitution ensures that such a
 
07:05:18.388 --> 07:05:18.398 align:start position:0%
decision is subject to debate public
 
07:05:20.948 --> 07:05:20.958 align:start position:0%
scrutiny and accountability most
 
07:05:23.430 --> 07:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
importantly accountability when Congress
 
07:05:25.388 --> 07:05:25.398 align:start position:0%
debates and votes on war involves the
 
07:05:28.430 --> 07:05:28.440 align:start position:0%
public in the whole process reinforcing
 
07:05:30.590 --> 07:05:30.600 align:start position:0%
Democratic and constitutional Republican
 
07:05:32.070 --> 07:05:32.080 align:start position:0%
governance just just like our
 
07:05:34.708 --> 07:05:34.718 align:start position:0%
legislature we took them both to both of
 
07:05:38.468 --> 07:05:38.478 align:start position:0%
those precedents in rule of law I think
 
07:05:41.628 --> 07:05:41.638 align:start position:0%
that actually we have set right now um
 
07:05:43.788 --> 07:05:43.798 align:start position:0%
what has been going on for decades
 
07:05:46.388 --> 07:05:46.398 align:start position:0%
ignoring the requirement for the for
 
07:05:48.830 --> 07:05:48.840 align:start position:0%
Congress has set the most dangerous
 
07:05:51.628 --> 07:05:51.638 align:start position:0%
precedent eroding constitutional Norms
 
07:05:54.590 --> 07:05:54.600 align:start position:0%
over time because that's what happens
 
07:05:57.590 --> 07:05:57.600 align:start position:0%
right when we don't follow we follow one
 
07:05:59.350 --> 07:05:59.360 align:start position:0%
part of it but we won't follow another
 
07:06:02.070 --> 07:06:02.080 align:start position:0%
part of it it doesn't work like that
 
07:06:03.990 --> 07:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
National Guard's roles and
 
07:06:06.430 --> 07:06:06.440 align:start position:0%
limitations um deploying the National
 
07:06:08.230 --> 07:06:08.240 align:start position:0%
Guard troops without Congressional
 
07:06:10.190 --> 07:06:10.200 align:start position:0%
Authority undermines the balance between
 
07:06:12.990 --> 07:06:13.000 align:start position:0%
federal and state Sovereign Authority
 
07:06:15.510 --> 07:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
moral and ethical considerations and
 
07:06:17.070 --> 07:06:17.080 align:start position:0%
then I'm going to end with historical
 
07:06:19.590 --> 07:06:19.600 align:start position:0%
content the framers were deeply
 
07:06:22.150 --> 07:06:22.160 align:start position:0%
influenced by the abuses of unilateral
 
07:06:24.708 --> 07:06:24.718 align:start position:0%
military power under monarchies and
 
07:06:27.350 --> 07:06:27.360 align:start position:0%
sought to ensure that war would be a
 
07:06:29.750 --> 07:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
collective decision to protect the
 
07:06:32.628 --> 07:06:32.638 align:start position:0%
nation from costly and unjustified
 
07:06:34.628 --> 07:06:34.638 align:start position:0%
conflicts by adhering to the
 
07:06:36.350 --> 07:06:36.360 align:start position:0%
Constitution and seeking Congressional
 
07:06:39.030 --> 07:06:39.040 align:start position:0%
approval for war the US honors its
 
07:06:41.468 --> 07:06:41.478 align:start position:0%
founding principles reinforces the rule
 
07:06:43.910 --> 07:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
of law and ensures that decisions of
 
07:06:47.590 --> 07:06:47.600 align:start position:0%
such magnitude are made responsibly and
 
07:06:49.430 --> 07:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
democratically thank
 
07:06:51.628 --> 07:06:51.638 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative would you
 
07:06:54.150 --> 07:06:54.160 align:start position:0%
take questions sure are there any
 
07:06:56.750 --> 07:06:56.760 align:start position:0%
questions at this
 
07:06:59.430 --> 07:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
time seeing none uh I thank you again
 
07:07:02.468 --> 07:07:02.478 align:start position:0%
for your testimony we have uh
 
07:07:06.468 --> 07:07:06.478 align:start position:0%
just a handful of folks still looking to
 
07:07:10.708 --> 07:07:10.718 align:start position:0%
speak uh Aubrey is still here yes are
 
07:07:16.910 --> 07:07:16.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:07:19.150 --> 07:07:19.160 align:start position:0%
Bridgewater uh Aubrey fredman
 
07:07:22.070 --> 07:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
Bridgewater um Mr chairman committee
 
07:07:24.750 --> 07:07:24.760 align:start position:0%
members I I definitely speak in support
 
07:07:26.628 --> 07:07:26.638 align:start position:0%
of this bill most of what I was going to
 
07:07:29.190 --> 07:07:29.200 align:start position:0%
say has already been said today so I'm
 
07:07:31.750 --> 07:07:31.760 align:start position:0%
going to vary from my uh notes a little
 
07:07:37.150 --> 07:07:37.160 align:start position:0%
bit so um there was talk about assets
 
07:07:39.628 --> 07:07:39.638 align:start position:0%
the most important assets to this are
 
07:07:41.830 --> 07:07:41.840 align:start position:0%
the men and women who serve in the
 
07:07:45.070 --> 07:07:45.080 align:start position:0%
military and why have we been sending
 
07:07:45.080 --> 07:07:47.030 align:start position:0%
military and why have we been sending
them

07:07:47.030 --> 07:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
them
 
07:07:49.868 --> 07:07:49.878 align:start position:0%
overseas fighting
 
07:07:49.878 --> 07:07:51.468 align:start position:0%
overseas fighting
Wars

07:07:51.468 --> 07:07:51.478 align:start position:0%
Wars
 
07:07:54.708 --> 07:07:54.718 align:start position:0%
that just you know obviously endless I
 
07:07:57.230 --> 07:07:57.240 align:start position:0%
mean wasn't it weird how we went from
 
07:08:00.910 --> 07:08:00.920 align:start position:0%
Afghanistan 20 years it ended not too
 
07:08:04.628 --> 07:08:04.638 align:start position:0%
well then suddenly it was uh excuse me
 
07:08:07.670 --> 07:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
Ukraine then it's the Middle East 40,000
 
07:08:10.310 --> 07:08:10.320 align:start position:0%
at troops uh in the Middle East we know
 
07:08:12.830 --> 07:08:12.840 align:start position:0%
a good chunk of those are National Guard
 
07:08:15.110 --> 07:08:15.120 align:start position:0%
and then there's talk about Iran and
 
07:08:17.628 --> 07:08:17.638 align:start position:0%
China I mean this just goes on and on
 
07:08:20.910 --> 07:08:20.920 align:start position:0%
with no defined purposes isn't it
 
07:08:23.788 --> 07:08:23.798 align:start position:0%
obvious this whole system is not working
 
07:08:26.910 --> 07:08:26.920 align:start position:0%
and people say well it's up to Congress
 
07:08:29.788 --> 07:08:29.798 align:start position:0%
to fix it they're never going to do it
 
07:08:32.030 --> 07:08:32.040 align:start position:0%
if they haven't done it in like at the
 
07:08:36.350 --> 07:08:36.360 align:start position:0%
last 20 years uh or longer I mean it the
 
07:08:39.388 --> 07:08:39.398 align:start position:0%
system is just it's set up wrong the
 
07:08:42.670 --> 07:08:42.680 align:start position:0%
military contractors Lobby them that's
 
07:08:45.030 --> 07:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
how they you know they get elected
 
07:08:46.548 --> 07:08:46.558 align:start position:0%
they're not going to vote for cutting
 
07:08:49.030 --> 07:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
the funding and they're and they
 
07:08:50.430 --> 07:08:50.440 align:start position:0%
definitely don't want to be go on the
 
07:08:54.830 --> 07:08:54.840 align:start position:0%
record as uh you know declaring war so
 
07:08:57.150 --> 07:08:57.160 align:start position:0%
we have to change the
 
07:09:00.190 --> 07:09:00.200 align:start position:0%
system and do something different and
 
07:09:02.948 --> 07:09:02.958 align:start position:0%
let New Hampshire should take the lead
 
07:09:04.990 --> 07:09:05.000 align:start position:0%
and and force the issue and then that
 
07:09:05.000 --> 07:09:05.868 align:start position:0%
and and force the issue and then that
will

07:09:05.868 --> 07:09:05.878 align:start position:0%
will
 
07:09:08.070 --> 07:09:08.080 align:start position:0%
probably uh you know other states are
 
07:09:09.590 --> 07:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
already working on it be nice if New
 
07:09:11.590 --> 07:09:11.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would be the first one but it
 
07:09:13.190 --> 07:09:13.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't really make any difference I
 
07:09:15.948 --> 07:09:15.958 align:start position:0%
think once it starts it'll start to like
 
07:09:18.388 --> 07:09:18.398 align:start position:0%
an avalanche and it would be a good
 
07:09:21.670 --> 07:09:21.680 align:start position:0%
thing we need to have public discussion
 
07:09:24.230 --> 07:09:24.240 align:start position:0%
before troops are sent
 
07:09:26.270 --> 07:09:26.280 align:start position:0%
overseas um and as far as the New
 
07:09:29.070 --> 07:09:29.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire guard themselves I think their
 
07:09:32.190 --> 07:09:32.200 align:start position:0%
primary purpose is here in this state
 
07:09:33.910 --> 07:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
and then helping other states in this
 
07:09:36.948 --> 07:09:36.958 align:start position:0%
country we have natural disasters or
 
07:09:39.110 --> 07:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
whatever things might happen that's
 
07:09:42.230 --> 07:09:42.240 align:start position:0%
their primary purpose and I think saving
 
07:09:45.750 --> 07:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
lives and saving property is much more
 
07:09:48.670 --> 07:09:48.680 align:start position:0%
beneficial than being deployed overseas
 
07:09:52.310 --> 07:09:52.320 align:start position:0%
and killing foreigners so that's um
 
07:09:53.948 --> 07:09:53.958 align:start position:0%
that's why I think we should pass this
 
07:09:57.628 --> 07:09:57.638 align:start position:0%
bill and those are my thoughts thank you
 
07:09:59.708 --> 07:09:59.718 align:start position:0%
thank you for those thoughts questions
 
07:10:01.628 --> 07:10:01.638 align:start position:0%
or will you take any questions if
 
07:10:05.868 --> 07:10:05.878 align:start position:0%
already Yes uh representative menal bomb
 
07:10:08.628 --> 07:10:08.638 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman so on your card
 
07:10:10.510 --> 07:10:10.520 align:start position:0%
here you noted that you have written
 
07:10:11.910 --> 07:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
testimony would you care to share that
 
07:10:14.510 --> 07:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
with us for the record yeah I I'll leave
 
07:10:16.430 --> 07:10:16.440 align:start position:0%
yes thank you you can bring it right up
 
07:10:19.510 --> 07:10:19.520 align:start position:0%
to the CL yeah
 
07:10:22.230 --> 07:10:22.240 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
07:10:25.510 --> 07:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
cyber um so I completely agree with you
 
07:10:28.270 --> 07:10:28.280 align:start position:0%
on that but do you see much like would
 
07:10:30.270 --> 07:10:30.280 align:start position:0%
you like to see legislation that has
 
07:10:32.628 --> 07:10:32.638 align:start position:0%
more value and actually
 
07:10:35.750 --> 07:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
maybe I know I'm going to say go after
 
07:10:40.310 --> 07:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
but you know maybe hampering or taxing
 
07:10:43.430 --> 07:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
or maybe not allowing such special
 
07:10:45.590 --> 07:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
interests such as mil those that
 
07:10:47.830 --> 07:10:47.840 align:start position:0%
contract with the military to make
 
07:10:49.070 --> 07:10:49.080 align:start position:0%
weapons of
 
07:10:51.590 --> 07:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
war so you're talking about
 
07:10:54.030 --> 07:10:54.040 align:start position:0%
lobbing not even just the lobbying I
 
07:10:55.868 --> 07:10:55.878 align:start position:0%
think the size of government when you've
 
07:10:58.510 --> 07:10:58.520 align:start position:0%
got big government you got lot of money
 
07:11:02.190 --> 07:11:02.200 align:start position:0%
at stake it's going to be
 
07:11:05.350 --> 07:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
the companies and and individuals
 
07:11:07.830 --> 07:11:07.840 align:start position:0%
they're going to Lobby so I you know
 
07:11:09.750 --> 07:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
they've been trying how do you get
 
07:11:12.750 --> 07:11:12.760 align:start position:0%
lobbing out of government big money you
 
07:11:17.270 --> 07:11:17.280 align:start position:0%
make it smaller so I yeah I I think that
 
07:11:20.030 --> 07:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
cut off the money and lower it and then
 
07:11:21.310 --> 07:11:21.320 align:start position:0%
then you you won't have as many
 
07:11:23.190 --> 07:11:23.200 align:start position:0%
lobbyists I think that's the only
 
07:11:27.270 --> 07:11:27.280 align:start position:0%
solution to that thanks other
 
07:11:29.868 --> 07:11:29.878 align:start position:0%
questions senan thank you for your
 
07:11:32.548 --> 07:11:32.558 align:start position:0%
testimony twice
 
07:11:36.670 --> 07:11:36.680 align:start position:0%
uh I have just a couple more uh Ron
 
07:11:39.030 --> 07:11:39.040 align:start position:0%

07:11:41.910 --> 07:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
here yes yes he is from from Bedford New
 
07:11:45.350 --> 07:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire opposes the bill I do and
 
07:11:48.230 --> 07:11:48.240 align:start position:0%
you've asked for four minutes or so Mr
 
07:11:49.990 --> 07:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
chairman committee so my name is
 
07:11:51.788 --> 07:11:51.798 align:start position:0%

retired 24 years of active duty
 
07:11:57.830 --> 07:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
service I was a tier one
 
07:12:00.670 --> 07:12:00.680 align:start position:0%
deployer been shot at by the Soviets and
 
07:12:00.680 --> 07:12:02.150 align:start position:0%
deployer been shot at by the Soviets and
others

07:12:02.150 --> 07:12:02.160 align:start position:0%
others
 
07:12:05.910 --> 07:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
worked in Navy uh office Naval
 
07:12:08.070 --> 07:12:08.080 align:start position:0%
intelligence worked with JCS on
 
07:12:09.788 --> 07:12:09.798 align:start position:0%
deployment of
 
07:12:12.708 --> 07:12:12.718 align:start position:0%
forces work budgets and
 
07:12:15.350 --> 07:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
funding right and I retired out of Nair
 
07:12:16.948 --> 07:12:16.958 align:start position:0%
running acquisition
 
07:12:19.868 --> 07:12:19.878 align:start position:0%
programs I work for one of those big
 
07:12:19.878 --> 07:12:21.750 align:start position:0%
programs I work for one of those big
defense

07:12:21.750 --> 07:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
defense
 
07:12:26.110 --> 07:12:26.120 align:start position:0%
contractors uh and I am very concerned
 
07:12:30.110 --> 07:12:30.120 align:start position:0%
about some of the comments and
 
07:12:33.350 --> 07:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
impressions that are unsupportable by
 
07:12:36.590 --> 07:12:36.600 align:start position:0%
evidence we have a lot of what seems to
 
07:12:40.230 --> 07:12:40.240 align:start position:0%
be um commentary and opinions that are
 
07:12:43.468 --> 07:12:43.478 align:start position:0%
unsupported by current facts I have a
 
07:12:46.388 --> 07:12:46.398 align:start position:0%
personal interest in this bill my son is
 
07:12:49.788 --> 07:12:49.798 align:start position:0%
in the Army National Guard here and he's
 
07:12:53.750 --> 07:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:12:58.310 --> 07:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so to me what we have here is
 
07:13:00.708 --> 07:13:00.718 align:start position:0%
a difference of opinion on foreign
 
07:13:02.310 --> 07:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
policy of the United
 
07:13:04.388 --> 07:13:04.398 align:start position:0%
States and we're going to solve it at
 
07:13:06.110 --> 07:13:06.120 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire
 
07:13:09.230 --> 07:13:09.240 align:start position:0%
level it sounds like if Secretary of
 
07:13:12.868 --> 07:13:12.878 align:start position:0%
Defense uh gets confirmed here he withth
 
07:13:15.110 --> 07:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
he's going to solve this for us because
 
07:13:17.190 --> 07:13:17.200 align:start position:0%
he's going to go in and he's going to
 
07:13:20.190 --> 07:13:20.200 align:start position:0%
remove or change or deauthorize the
 
07:13:22.350 --> 07:13:22.360 align:start position:0%
authorization for military force and
 
07:13:24.350 --> 07:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
this matter will be done with and we
 
07:13:27.830 --> 07:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
will go back and use direct uh you know
 
07:13:29.990 --> 07:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
adherence to the Constitution under the
 
07:13:32.350 --> 07:13:32.360 align:start position:0%
perception some people have
 
07:13:34.830 --> 07:13:34.840 align:start position:0%
year this has come up as we've said
 
07:13:37.150 --> 07:13:37.160 align:start position:0%
since uh prior to World or after World
 
07:13:40.910 --> 07:13:40.920 align:start position:0%
War II uh Vietnam uh we've heard about
 
07:13:43.670 --> 07:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
President Nixon in the War Powers
 
07:13:47.830 --> 07:13:47.840 align:start position:0%
Act the authorization uh military
 
07:13:51.110 --> 07:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
force has been questioned but nobody in
 
07:13:53.510 --> 07:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
the department of justice has ever ruled
 
07:13:56.310 --> 07:13:56.320 align:start position:0%
against it no one no one has said this
 
07:13:58.948 --> 07:13:58.958 align:start position:0%
is in the Judiciary has said this is
 
07:13:58.958 --> 07:14:02.270 align:start position:0%
is in the Judiciary has said this is
unconstitutional

07:14:02.270 --> 07:14:02.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:05.830 --> 07:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
but a lot of trained legal experts here
 
07:14:07.910 --> 07:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
are saying that it's
 
07:14:10.030 --> 07:14:10.040 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional I think I'm going to
 
07:14:12.388 --> 07:14:12.398 align:start position:0%
rest with those who've made it up to the
 
07:14:14.628 --> 07:14:14.638 align:start position:0%
federal level and have the training and
 
07:14:19.708 --> 07:14:19.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:22.628 --> 07:14:22.638 align:start position:0%
position this is a national level effort
 
07:14:23.628 --> 07:14:23.638 align:start position:0%
as we've
 
07:14:27.310 --> 07:14:27.320 align:start position:0%
heard um it's to end endless
 
07:14:31.070 --> 07:14:31.080 align:start position:0%
Wars I deal with foreign policy every
 
07:14:34.468 --> 07:14:34.478 align:start position:0%
every day the threats to this nation
 
07:14:34.478 --> 07:14:35.590 align:start position:0%
every day the threats to this nation
they're

07:14:35.590 --> 07:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
they're
 
07:14:37.990 --> 07:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
huge and they don't get talked about
 
07:14:40.830 --> 07:14:40.840 align:start position:0%
because we can't talk about but every
 
07:14:43.510 --> 07:14:43.520 align:start position:0%
day I go to work
 
07:14:45.708 --> 07:14:45.718 align:start position:0%
wondering what are we going to do to
 
07:14:47.628 --> 07:14:47.638 align:start position:0%
handle this situation with a demission
 
07:14:50.670 --> 07:14:50.680 align:start position:0%
diminishing manufacturing base uh
 
07:14:52.070 --> 07:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
underfunding of the
 
07:14:55.310 --> 07:14:55.320 align:start position:0%
military Readiness issues
 
07:14:57.868 --> 07:14:57.878 align:start position:0%
potentially fortunately not in the guard
 
07:15:00.270 --> 07:15:00.280 align:start position:0%
here we have a fantastic guard in the
 
07:15:04.110 --> 07:15:04.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:15:07.230 --> 07:15:07.240 align:start position:0%
any mil uh and not every conflict is a
 
07:15:10.948 --> 07:15:10.958 align:start position:0%
war I deployed many times to prevent war
 
07:15:13.070 --> 07:15:13.080 align:start position:0%
from breaking
 
07:15:16.350 --> 07:15:16.360 align:start position:0%
out a lot of these things particularly
 
07:15:16.360 --> 07:15:18.590 align:start position:0%
out a lot of these things particularly
for

07:15:18.590 --> 07:15:18.600 align:start position:0%
for
 
07:15:21.468 --> 07:15:21.478 align:start position:0%
Syria that's we're not there defending
 
07:15:23.990 --> 07:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
just oil interests we are there to
 
07:15:27.628 --> 07:15:27.638 align:start position:0%
prevent the rise of Isis one
 
07:15:30.030 --> 07:15:30.040 align:start position:0%
Administration grossly underestimated
 
07:15:35.230 --> 07:15:35.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:15:38.310 --> 07:15:38.320 align:start position:0%
League a president who is now coming
 
07:15:41.548 --> 07:15:41.558 align:start position:0%
back into office put troops under the
 
07:15:46.430 --> 07:15:46.440 align:start position:0%
aumf into Syria to handle
 
07:15:50.030 --> 07:15:50.040 align:start position:0%
Isis they are still there because what
 
07:15:52.468 --> 07:15:52.478 align:start position:0%
starts there will
 
07:15:55.948 --> 07:15:55.958 align:start position:0%
grow Wars are not fought where
 
07:15:58.868 --> 07:15:58.878 align:start position:0%
isolationism is not a valid foreign
 
07:16:01.150 --> 07:16:01.160 align:start position:0%
policy right you need to only look back
 
07:16:05.948 --> 07:16:05.958 align:start position:0%
to 1936 what was the net effect of
 
07:16:09.388 --> 07:16:09.398 align:start position:0%
isolationism of not defending Europe at
 
07:16:14.190 --> 07:16:14.200 align:start position:0%
the start it was an Nexus of 25 million
 
07:16:16.548 --> 07:16:16.558 align:start position:0%
people so fighting battles of foreign
 
07:16:19.868 --> 07:16:19.878 align:start position:0%
policy on shaky speculative uh
 
07:16:21.388 --> 07:16:21.398 align:start position:0%
constitutional grounds that have never
 
07:16:23.270 --> 07:16:23.280 align:start position:0%
been uphold held by the Department of
 
07:16:25.590 --> 07:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
Justice makes absolutely no sense
 
07:16:27.350 --> 07:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
particularly if it puts at risk the
 
07:16:30.628 --> 07:16:30.638 align:start position:0%
funding for our guard this bill should
 
07:16:30.638 --> 07:16:31.388 align:start position:0%
funding for our guard this bill should
be

07:16:31.388 --> 07:16:31.398 align:start position:0%
be
 
07:16:33.910 --> 07:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
renamed not defend the guard it should
 
07:16:36.468 --> 07:16:36.478 align:start position:0%
be really named defund the guard because
 
07:16:38.910 --> 07:16:38.920 align:start position:0%
that's what going to happen now having
 
07:16:43.350 --> 07:16:43.360 align:start position:0%
built budget exhibits for the hill I can
 
07:16:46.070 --> 07:16:46.080 align:start position:0%
tell you our priorities go to those who
 
07:16:49.190 --> 07:16:49.200 align:start position:0%
are trained ready and at the tip of the
 
07:16:52.750 --> 07:16:52.760 align:start position:0%
spear as general melodus stated the
 
07:16:56.070 --> 07:16:56.080 align:start position:0%
funding for the guard is not set by
 
07:16:59.030 --> 07:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
senators and congressmen to allocate to
 
07:17:01.388 --> 07:17:01.398 align:start position:0%
their states it goes to the guard
 
07:17:03.150 --> 07:17:03.160 align:start position:0%
department and the Bureau of the
 
07:17:05.510 --> 07:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
National Guard makes those allocations
 
07:17:08.548 --> 07:17:08.558 align:start position:0%
of where that funding goes and my buddy
 
07:17:11.230 --> 07:17:11.240 align:start position:0%
Colonel Pete Kowski back there already
 
07:17:14.788 --> 07:17:14.798 align:start position:0%
told you how those allocations are made
 
07:17:14.798 --> 07:17:16.590 align:start position:0%
told you how those allocations are made
right

07:17:16.590 --> 07:17:16.600 align:start position:0%
right
 
07:17:19.310 --> 07:17:19.320 align:start position:0%
so I don't really trust anybody who has
 
07:17:21.750 --> 07:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
not built a military budget to tell me
 
07:17:24.548 --> 07:17:24.558 align:start position:0%
how the military funds things I was
 
07:17:28.190 --> 07:17:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:30.548 --> 07:17:30.558 align:start position:0%
weren't any military officer will tell
 
07:17:32.830 --> 07:17:32.840 align:start position:0%
you training in a real world environment
 
07:17:34.310 --> 07:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
with forces that you'll be working with
 
07:17:36.788 --> 07:17:36.798 align:start position:0%
in Wartime environment are essential to
 
07:17:39.548 --> 07:17:39.558 align:start position:0%
the safety of any of our military uh
 
07:17:41.590 --> 07:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
soldiers Sailors Marines and Air Force
 
07:17:44.310 --> 07:17:44.320 align:start position:0%
personnel loss of training opportunities
 
07:17:46.468 --> 07:17:46.478 align:start position:0%
should we lose those High Mars
 
07:17:48.590 --> 07:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
battalions or those tankers or anything
 
07:17:50.910 --> 07:17:50.920 align:start position:0%
else to Massachusetts Maine or
 
07:17:54.310 --> 07:17:54.320 align:start position:0%
Vermont is going to place great risk on
 
07:17:56.468 --> 07:17:56.478 align:start position:0%
those troops that still remain in the
 
07:17:58.388 --> 07:17:58.398 align:start position:0%
guard provided we find a way to fund
 
07:18:00.948 --> 07:18:00.958 align:start position:0%
them I don't want my son deploying
 
07:18:02.628 --> 07:18:02.638 align:start position:0%
without proper
 
07:18:04.868 --> 07:18:04.878 align:start position:0%
training I want him training with the
 
07:18:07.430 --> 07:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
people he's going to be working
 
07:18:09.350 --> 07:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
with our
 
07:18:12.590 --> 07:18:12.600 align:start position:0%
country has not faced threats of this
 
07:18:16.350 --> 07:18:16.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:18:20.150 --> 07:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
II we have four major
 
07:18:23.868 --> 07:18:23.878 align:start position:0%
opposition or Oppo opponents going on
 
07:18:26.030 --> 07:18:26.040 align:start position:0%
right now and when I joined the military
 
07:18:29.670 --> 07:18:29.680 align:start position:0%
in 1982 under Ronald Reagan we had to
 
07:18:32.350 --> 07:18:32.360 align:start position:0%
reconstitute a followed out Military we
 
07:18:35.388 --> 07:18:35.398 align:start position:0%
had to be able to hold back two sets two
 
07:18:35.398 --> 07:18:36.910 align:start position:0%
had to be able to hold back two sets two
Wars

07:18:36.910 --> 07:18:36.920 align:start position:0%
Wars
 
07:18:39.110 --> 07:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
simultaneously and then under uh as the
 
07:18:42.310 --> 07:18:42.320 align:start position:0%
funding went down we went to win and
 
07:18:46.750 --> 07:18:46.760 align:start position:0%
hold and win so we would hold one uh one
 
07:18:49.628 --> 07:18:49.638 align:start position:0%
theater where it was currently uh and
 
07:18:51.628 --> 07:18:51.638 align:start position:0%
prevent uh the opposing forces from
 
07:18:53.110 --> 07:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
taking over or achieving their
 
07:18:55.190 --> 07:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
objectives while we fought one war and
 
07:18:56.270 --> 07:18:56.280 align:start position:0%
then we would have to move all our
 
07:19:00.310 --> 07:19:00.320 align:start position:0%
troops over and uh win it you know win
 
07:19:01.590 --> 07:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
the second
 
07:19:01.600 --> 07:19:02.548 align:start position:0%
the second
second

07:19:02.548 --> 07:19:02.558 align:start position:0%
second
 
07:19:05.110 --> 07:19:05.120 align:start position:0%
conflict the guard became an essential
 
07:19:07.388 --> 07:19:07.398 align:start position:0%
part of the force structure in order to
 
07:19:07.398 --> 07:19:08.190 align:start position:0%
part of the force structure in order to
do

07:19:08.190 --> 07:19:08.200 align:start position:0%
do
 
07:19:11.310 --> 07:19:11.320 align:start position:0%
that and every Guardsman that signs up
 
07:19:13.070 --> 07:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
signs to the same oath that I took when
 
07:19:15.510 --> 07:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
I signed up at the age of
 
07:19:18.468 --> 07:19:18.478 align:start position:0%
18 support and defend the
 
07:19:21.750 --> 07:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
Constitution We Trust in our leaders
 
07:19:23.230 --> 07:19:23.240 align:start position:0%
that we elect the
 
07:19:29.030 --> 07:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:19:31.270 --> 07:19:31.280 align:start position:0%
thing and now we're questioning their
 
07:19:33.468 --> 07:19:33.478 align:start position:0%
morals their values and we're accusing
 
07:19:35.030 --> 07:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
them of weakness because they won't
 
07:19:37.948 --> 07:19:37.958 align:start position:0%
stand up because of a few individuals
 
07:19:39.750 --> 07:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
interpretation what
 
07:19:42.830 --> 07:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
constitutionality uh consists of I'm
 
07:19:45.468 --> 07:19:45.478 align:start position:0%
sorry I don't buy that because otherwise
 
07:19:48.230 --> 07:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
we'd be removing them from office and I
 
07:19:55.830 --> 07:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:19:58.948 --> 07:19:58.958 align:start position:0%
level as I said I have over 24 years of
 
07:20:01.190 --> 07:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
military uh experience
 
07:20:03.990 --> 07:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
I have uh experience in building budgets
 
07:20:05.868 --> 07:20:05.878 align:start position:0%
I have experience in the acquisition
 
07:20:08.230 --> 07:20:08.240 align:start position:0%
Community right I've read the federal
 
07:20:10.708 --> 07:20:10.718 align:start position:0%
acquisition rules I have to live by them
 
07:20:13.670 --> 07:20:13.680 align:start position:0%
I have to live by them as a contractor
 
07:20:16.150 --> 07:20:16.160 align:start position:0%
if you honestly think that we sit in a
 
07:20:19.070 --> 07:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
back room and negotiate sweetheart deals
 
07:20:23.670 --> 07:20:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:26.750 --> 07:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
make you are unaware of the legal
 
07:20:29.310 --> 07:20:29.320 align:start position:0%
ramifications for anything like that I
 
07:20:30.788 --> 07:20:30.798 align:start position:0%
would be spending most of my time time
 
07:20:32.110 --> 07:20:32.120 align:start position:0%
in jail from here
 
07:20:35.150 --> 07:20:35.160 align:start position:0%
on we have so many rules in effect of
 
07:20:37.110 --> 07:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
who we can talk to during Source
 
07:20:39.388 --> 07:20:39.398 align:start position:0%
selection and Source selection is run by
 
07:20:41.548 --> 07:20:41.558 align:start position:0%
needs and needs are generated all the
 
07:20:44.788 --> 07:20:44.798 align:start position:0%
way up the chain all right they're not
 
07:20:47.150 --> 07:20:47.160 align:start position:0%
negotiated in back room deals so
 
07:20:50.670 --> 07:20:50.680 align:start position:0%
contractors like myself can get rich in
 
07:20:53.468 --> 07:20:53.478 align:start position:0%
fact the amount of profit or fee that we
 
07:20:56.150 --> 07:20:56.160 align:start position:0%
can take on a contract is very limited
 
07:21:00.070 --> 07:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
most cases 10% or less think about that
 
07:21:01.670 --> 07:21:01.680 align:start position:0%
for a minute if you're a small business
 
07:21:04.910 --> 07:21:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:21:07.430 --> 07:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
markup 30 40
 
07:21:13.430 --> 07:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:21:17.910 --> 07:21:17.920 align:start position:0%
10% why are things so uh costly you know
 
07:21:19.230 --> 07:21:19.240 align:start position:0%
that's a whole separate argument but
 
07:21:22.310 --> 07:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
basically we build in small numbers
 
07:21:22.320 --> 07:21:25.150 align:start position:0%
basically we build in small numbers
so

07:21:25.150 --> 07:21:25.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:21:27.830 --> 07:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
um all right as a retired naval officer
 
07:21:29.430 --> 07:21:29.440 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned uh I can assure you the
 
07:21:31.030 --> 07:21:31.040 align:start position:0%
funding decisions are made
 
07:21:33.628 --> 07:21:33.638 align:start position:0%
by prioritizing forces that are ready to
 
07:21:35.948 --> 07:21:35.958 align:start position:0%
go and those that are not ready to go
 
07:21:37.788 --> 07:21:37.798 align:start position:0%
but have Capital Equipment that's very
 
07:21:41.150 --> 07:21:41.160 align:start position:0%
valuable tankers uh or the high Mars
 
07:21:43.510 --> 07:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
those will go to other
 
07:21:45.830 --> 07:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
units loss of our guards funding and
 
07:21:47.468 --> 07:21:47.478 align:start position:0%
resultant reduction rightness because of
 
07:21:49.510 --> 07:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
a political debate in Washington by a
 
07:21:51.350 --> 07:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
few members of congress with our own
 
07:21:54.110 --> 07:21:54.120 align:start position:0%
agenda by the way Rand Paul is firmly
 
07:21:56.910 --> 07:21:56.920 align:start position:0%
behind this and for the record I am a
 
07:21:59.670 --> 07:21:59.680 align:start position:0%
republican once funding is lost it may
 
07:22:02.628 --> 07:22:02.638 align:start position:0%
never be uh restored and our guard would
 
07:22:05.388 --> 07:22:05.398 align:start position:0%
end up watching on the sidelines or what
 
07:22:07.590 --> 07:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
remains of our guard while the rest of
 
07:22:09.590 --> 07:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
the country goes off and supports their
 
07:22:09.600 --> 07:22:11.628 align:start position:0%
the country goes off and supports their
original

07:22:11.628 --> 07:22:11.638 align:start position:0%
original
 
07:22:14.070 --> 07:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
Mission I can think of nothing more
 
07:22:17.230 --> 07:22:17.240 align:start position:0%
humiliating as an American or a military
 
07:22:19.110 --> 07:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
officer or a
 
07:22:21.990 --> 07:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
member uh of the State of New Hampshire
 
07:22:25.430 --> 07:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
than watching other people defend my
 
07:22:27.150 --> 07:22:27.160 align:start position:0%
freedoms and I don't have the
 
07:22:30.070 --> 07:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do so nor my son a third
 
07:22:30.080 --> 07:22:31.190 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do so nor my son a third
generation

07:22:31.190 --> 07:22:31.200 align:start position:0%
generation
 
07:22:31.200 --> 07:22:33.750 align:start position:0%
generation
military

07:22:33.750 --> 07:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:22:33.760 --> 07:22:36.670 align:start position:0%
 
member

07:22:36.670 --> 07:22:36.680 align:start position:0%
member
 
07:22:39.910 --> 07:22:39.920 align:start position:0%
so I also have questions in removing uh
 
07:22:42.708 --> 07:22:42.718 align:start position:0%
our Governor's ability to uh make
 
07:22:45.350 --> 07:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
decisions regarding her guard which she
 
07:22:48.830 --> 07:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
is in charge of uh between title 10 and
 
07:22:51.270 --> 07:22:51.280 align:start position:0%
title 32 uh I think some of the comments
 
07:22:53.628 --> 07:22:53.638 align:start position:0%
have relaxed that when when the guard is
 
07:22:56.670 --> 07:22:56.680 align:start position:0%
called up she does not have a a say in
 
07:22:59.110 --> 07:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
that anyway uh they are federalized at
 
07:23:00.990 --> 07:23:01.000 align:start position:0%
that point in time
 
07:23:03.270 --> 07:23:03.280 align:start position:0%
uh I realize there's I touched on a
 
07:23:05.190 --> 07:23:05.200 align:start position:0%
number of different topics uh
 
07:23:07.910 --> 07:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
acquisition intelligence how decisions

I support defend the guard I'm a huge
 
07:24:58.468 --> 07:24:58.478 align:start position:0%
supporter of defend the guard um because
 
07:25:00.830 --> 07:25:00.840 align:start position:0%
as a veteran I've seen firsthand the
 
07:25:04.150 --> 07:25:04.160 align:start position:0%
Devastation uh and the consequences that
 
07:25:06.788 --> 07:25:06.798 align:start position:0%
these endless Wars has caused uh I've
 
07:25:09.750 --> 07:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
watched many of my friends come back
 
07:25:09.760 --> 07:25:11.190 align:start position:0%
watched many of my friends come back
permanently

07:25:11.190 --> 07:25:11.200 align:start position:0%
permanently
 
07:25:14.308 --> 07:25:14.318 align:start position:0%
disfigured uh mentally shattered we
 
07:25:15.990 --> 07:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
heard somebody earlier talking about
 
07:25:18.948 --> 07:25:18.958 align:start position:0%
suicide rates I've lost five friends
 
07:25:20.670 --> 07:25:20.680 align:start position:0%
that were veterans to
 
07:25:24.468 --> 07:25:24.478 align:start position:0%
Suicide two of them were in the National
 
07:25:27.628 --> 07:25:27.638 align:start position:0%
Guard we live in a world today where 20
 
07:25:30.628 --> 07:25:30.638 align:start position:0%
million people over the last 24 years
 
07:25:33.430 --> 07:25:33.440 align:start position:0%
since 9911 have been displaced of their
 
07:25:36.030 --> 07:25:36.040 align:start position:0%
homes we live in a world today where
 
07:25:39.270 --> 07:25:39.280 align:start position:0%
over 2 million people have died from
 
07:25:42.070 --> 07:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
these wars these endless Wars
 
07:25:45.388 --> 07:25:45.398 align:start position:0%
overseas to put that into
 
07:25:47.628 --> 07:25:47.638 align:start position:0%
perspective that's more than our entire
 
07:25:47.638 --> 07:25:49.030 align:start position:0%
perspective that's more than our entire
State's

07:25:49.030 --> 07:25:49.040 align:start position:0%
State's
 
07:25:50.990 --> 07:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
population these aren't just numbers
 
07:25:52.670 --> 07:25:52.680 align:start position:0%
these are human lives that we're talking
 
07:25:55.788 --> 07:25:55.798 align:start position:0%
about here obviously you you probably
 
07:25:57.308 --> 07:25:57.318 align:start position:0%
get a sense that I'm passionate about
 
07:26:00.990 --> 07:26:01.000 align:start position:0%
this because uh I'm talking about people
 
07:26:03.350 --> 07:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
who are literally people I I I looked
 
07:26:05.708 --> 07:26:05.718 align:start position:0%
across the room on and these are my best
 
07:26:07.070 --> 07:26:07.080 align:start position:0%
friends that I'm talking about many of
 
07:26:09.070 --> 07:26:09.080 align:start position:0%
them lost their
 
07:26:12.110 --> 07:26:12.120 align:start position:0%
lives now imagine looking me looking
 
07:26:15.830 --> 07:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
into the eyes of any of their families
 
07:26:19.388 --> 07:26:19.398 align:start position:0%
and suggesting that we haven't been at
 
07:26:21.788 --> 07:26:21.798 align:start position:0%
War this entire time that's
 
07:26:25.270 --> 07:26:25.280 align:start position:0%
ridiculous um Congress hasn't uh you
 
07:26:27.628 --> 07:26:27.638 align:start position:0%
know obviously done its due diligence by
 
07:26:28.948 --> 07:26:28.958 align:start position:0%
upholding the
 
07:26:31.990 --> 07:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
Constitution um you know which requires
 
07:26:33.670 --> 07:26:33.680 align:start position:0%
them to make an official declaration of
 
07:26:36.830 --> 07:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
war we've heard this many times today I
 
07:26:38.548 --> 07:26:38.558 align:start position:0%
think the two words of the of the day
 
07:26:40.430 --> 07:26:40.440 align:start position:0%
are probably Constitution and funding
 
07:26:42.150 --> 07:26:42.160 align:start position:0%
you guys might want to play a drinking
 
07:26:45.628 --> 07:26:45.638 align:start position:0%
game later to to work that one out um
 
07:26:47.910 --> 07:26:47.920 align:start position:0%
but uh the last time Congress declared
 
07:26:51.110 --> 07:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
war was 83 years ago it'd be absurd for
 
07:26:53.910 --> 07:26:53.920 align:start position:0%
me to look uh in the eyes of the mother
 
07:26:57.708 --> 07:26:57.718 align:start position:0%
of of my best friend and tell her that
 
07:26:59.388 --> 07:26:59.398 align:start position:0%
her son wasn't at War because they just
 
07:27:01.110 --> 07:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
never declared it that's
 
07:27:03.388 --> 07:27:03.398 align:start position:0%
ridiculous and I'm sure no nobody would
 
07:27:06.868 --> 07:27:06.878 align:start position:0%
disagree with that um but it's your duty
 
07:27:09.548 --> 07:27:09.558 align:start position:0%
as lawmakers to uphold the Constitution
 
07:27:11.670 --> 07:27:11.680 align:start position:0%
it it that is the number one priority
 
07:27:15.150 --> 07:27:15.160 align:start position:0%
defend the guard is about just that uh
 
07:27:17.788 --> 07:27:17.798 align:start position:0%
it ensures that New Hampshire uh
 
07:27:20.670 --> 07:27:20.680 align:start position:0%
Guardsmen won't be sent overseas until
 
07:27:22.868 --> 07:27:22.878 align:start position:0%
they do their constitutional
 
07:27:25.030 --> 07:27:25.040 align:start position:0%
responsibility and declare war if that's
 
07:27:26.788 --> 07:27:26.798 align:start position:0%
what they deem is
 
07:27:29.628 --> 07:27:29.638 align:start position:0%
necessary now I know there's a lot of
 
07:27:32.548 --> 07:27:32.558 align:start position:0%
concerns about funding uh and that's
 
07:27:34.230 --> 07:27:34.240 align:start position:0%
something that just keeps getting
 
07:27:36.388 --> 07:27:36.398 align:start position:0%
brought up and mentioned over and over
 
07:27:38.830 --> 07:27:38.840 align:start position:0%
uh but let me remind everybody here that
 
07:27:41.270 --> 07:27:41.280 align:start position:0%
the military-industrial complex is one
 
07:27:43.230 --> 07:27:43.240 align:start position:0%
of the most bloated and overfunded
 
07:27:46.308 --> 07:27:46.318 align:start position:0%
entities in the entire government uh
 
07:27:49.430 --> 07:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
they have received over $14 trillion
 
07:27:52.350 --> 07:27:52.360 align:start position:0%
since 911 that's over half of our
 
07:27:56.990 --> 07:27:57.000 align:start position:0%
ballooning uh uh National debts um
 
07:28:01.388 --> 07:28:01.398 align:start position:0%
amount so the Constitution does not care
 
07:28:03.670 --> 07:28:03.680 align:start position:0%
about funding concerns and uh neither
 
07:28:05.590 --> 07:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
should you when it comes to the lives
 
07:28:07.788 --> 07:28:07.798 align:start position:0%
and the Liberties of our national
 
07:28:10.628 --> 07:28:10.638 align:start position:0%
Guardsmen and our residents here in New
 
07:28:12.670 --> 07:28:12.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if we're not sending our
 
07:28:14.830 --> 07:28:14.840 align:start position:0%
Guardsmen overseas it just
 
07:28:16.590 --> 07:28:16.600 align:start position:0%
mathematically checks out that it's not
 
07:28:18.070 --> 07:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
going to be as
 
07:28:20.990 --> 07:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
expensive uh you know how much money are
 
07:28:24.510 --> 07:28:24.520 align:start position:0%
the lives of those 2 million people that
 
07:28:27.868 --> 07:28:27.878 align:start position:0%
died overseas worth as well or the 15
 
07:28:29.430 --> 07:28:29.440 align:start position:0%
National Guardsmen that have died since
 
07:28:29.440 --> 07:28:30.990 align:start position:0%
National Guardsmen that have died since
9/11

07:28:30.990 --> 07:28:31.000 align:start position:0%
9/11
 
07:28:33.430 --> 07:28:33.440 align:start position:0%
we paid out probably almost $10 million
 
07:28:35.388 --> 07:28:35.398 align:start position:0%
to those families we can start with
 
07:28:36.990 --> 07:28:37.000 align:start position:0%
budget cuts right there instead of
 
07:28:39.070 --> 07:28:39.080 align:start position:0%
sending them the money you know that
 
07:28:42.110 --> 07:28:42.120 align:start position:0%
that it's it's it's all absurd to
 
07:28:44.750 --> 07:28:44.760 align:start position:0%
me but this is so much more than just
 
07:28:47.270 --> 07:28:47.280 align:start position:0%
dollars and cents it really is it's
 
07:28:49.990 --> 07:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
about upholding the principles that this
 
07:28:52.308 --> 07:28:52.318 align:start position:0%
country was founded on something that
 
07:28:54.510 --> 07:28:54.520 align:start position:0%
every single one of you guys has a duty
 
07:28:55.910 --> 07:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
to to
 
07:28:58.308 --> 07:28:58.318 align:start position:0%
do it's about protecting our neighbors
 
07:29:01.030 --> 07:29:01.040 align:start position:0%
and our families and it's about
 
07:29:03.230 --> 07:29:03.240 align:start position:0%
protecting the granite Staters uh from
 
07:29:05.590 --> 07:29:05.600 align:start position:0%
being sent off to die in wars that
 
07:29:08.510 --> 07:29:08.520 align:start position:0%
haven't even been formally
 
07:29:10.430 --> 07:29:10.440 align:start position:0%
authorized you don't just have a
 
07:29:13.308 --> 07:29:13.318 align:start position:0%
responsibility you have a fiscal
 
07:29:13.318 --> 07:29:17.948 align:start position:0%
responsibility you have a fiscal
responsibility

07:29:17.948 --> 07:29:17.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:29:22.230 --> 07:29:22.240 align:start position:0%
too this is our moment to stand with
 
07:29:24.590 --> 07:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
veterans uh all across New Hampshire
 
07:29:27.230 --> 07:29:27.240 align:start position:0%
across the country vast majority of them
 
07:29:30.350 --> 07:29:30.360 align:start position:0%
do support this type of legislation uh
 
07:29:32.708 --> 07:29:32.718 align:start position:0%
to bring our troops home and to not just
 
07:29:34.190 --> 07:29:34.200 align:start position:0%
our national Guardsman eventually
 
07:29:37.468 --> 07:29:37.478 align:start position:0%
hopefully we can protect our troops by
 
07:29:39.070 --> 07:29:39.080 align:start position:0%
having them right here at home instead
 
07:29:41.548 --> 07:29:41.558 align:start position:0%
of sending them everywhere
 
07:29:45.308 --> 07:29:45.318 align:start position:0%
else now we had talked about Congress
 
07:29:47.788 --> 07:29:47.798 align:start position:0%
having a duty as well to uphold the
 
07:29:49.590 --> 07:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
Constitution and we can't we can't
 
07:29:51.788 --> 07:29:51.798 align:start position:0%
dismiss that but that's not you guys's
 
07:29:54.308 --> 07:29:54.318 align:start position:0%
problem that's our problem we need to
 
07:29:56.990 --> 07:29:57.000 align:start position:0%
all vote as taxpayers to vote the people
 
07:29:58.510 --> 07:29:58.520 align:start position:0%
who are voting for these NeverEnding
 
07:30:01.590 --> 07:30:01.600 align:start position:0%
Wars you know we need to vote them out
 
07:30:03.788 --> 07:30:03.798 align:start position:0%
but Congress is incentivized to keep
 
07:30:06.468 --> 07:30:06.478 align:start position:0%
these wars going they're being funded by
 
07:30:10.070 --> 07:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:30:13.468 --> 07:30:13.478 align:start position:0%
Ron even Joe Biden's secretary of
 
07:30:15.948 --> 07:30:15.958 align:start position:0%
defense for the last several years Lloyd
 
07:30:17.868 --> 07:30:17.878 align:start position:0%
Austin he tripled his
 
07:30:20.910 --> 07:30:20.920 align:start position:0%
portfolio because of the contracts that
 
07:30:23.030 --> 07:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
he uh sent off to other countries
 
07:30:25.590 --> 07:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
selling them missiles and bombs and all
 
07:30:28.308 --> 07:30:28.318 align:start position:0%
this stuff but we can close that door
 
07:30:31.510 --> 07:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
permanently we deserve State autonomy
 
07:30:34.190 --> 07:30:34.200 align:start position:0%
states have rights and you guys have a
 
07:30:36.150 --> 07:30:36.160 align:start position:0%
responsibility to look after New
 
07:30:39.590 --> 07:30:39.600 align:start position:0%

07:30:43.110 --> 07:30:43.120 align:start position:0%
voting you in to represent
 
07:30:45.910 --> 07:30:45.920 align:start position:0%
them if our state ever has an
 
07:30:47.788 --> 07:30:47.798 align:start position:0%
emergency they're going to be here to
 
07:30:50.388 --> 07:30:50.398 align:start position:0%
help with that we're going to have
 
07:30:53.548 --> 07:30:53.558 align:start position:0%
abundant resources I have no doubt in my
 
07:30:55.868 --> 07:30:55.878 align:start position:0%
mind that there's not going to be any
 
07:30:58.468 --> 07:30:58.478 align:start position:0%
funding cuts for the military this is
 
07:31:00.510 --> 07:31:00.520 align:start position:0%
it's just not going to happen
 
07:31:02.350 --> 07:31:02.360 align:start position:0%
they transfer things around it's all
 
07:31:04.388 --> 07:31:04.398 align:start position:0%
money games you guys know how budgets
 
07:31:06.750 --> 07:31:06.760 align:start position:0%

Hampshire I hope that you'll do the
 
07:31:23.190 --> 07:31:23.200 align:start position:0%
right thing and I hope that you'll pass
 
07:31:25.388 --> 07:31:25.398 align:start position:0%
defend the guard I hope that we can lead
 
07:31:28.030 --> 07:31:28.040 align:start position:0%
the nation in this and everyone can look
 
07:31:31.350 --> 07:31:31.360 align:start position:0%
at us as the examples for what doing the
 
07:31:34.308 --> 07:31:34.318 align:start position:0%
right thing looks like thank
 
07:31:37.868 --> 07:31:37.878 align:start position:0%
you thank you for your testimony Mr we
 
07:31:39.110 --> 07:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
there would you take questions if there
 
07:31:41.230 --> 07:31:41.240 align:start position:0%
are any sure are there any questions at
 
07:31:44.110 --> 07:31:44.120 align:start position:0%
this time representative saber thanks
 
07:31:47.110 --> 07:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um um so one of
 
07:31:49.670 --> 07:31:49.680 align:start position:0%
my issues when we EXA this bill the last
 
07:31:52.230 --> 07:31:52.240 align:start position:0%
time was that I kind of have a hard time
 
07:31:54.708 --> 07:31:54.718 align:start position:0%
seeing just because well there's the
 
07:31:56.548 --> 07:31:56.558 align:start position:0%
requirements that are here that are
 
07:31:59.308 --> 07:31:59.318 align:start position:0%
saying that okay well it's all fine if
 
07:32:01.430 --> 07:32:01.440 align:start position:0%
the if they just you know if Congress
 
07:32:04.670 --> 07:32:04.680 align:start position:0%
declares war you know and to me it seems
 
07:32:06.948 --> 07:32:06.958 align:start position:0%
like the special interests will just go
 
07:32:09.110 --> 07:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
in there and buy up politicians even
 
07:32:11.548 --> 07:32:11.558 align:start position:0%
more than they already do right now just
 
07:32:13.788 --> 07:32:13.798 align:start position:0%
to make sure War gets declared to keep
 
07:32:17.308 --> 07:32:17.318 align:start position:0%
doing what they do do see that as they
 
07:32:19.548 --> 07:32:19.558 align:start position:0%
are certainly going to that I mean I
 
07:32:21.750 --> 07:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
have no doubt in my mind that they're
 
07:32:24.150 --> 07:32:24.160 align:start position:0%
lobbying against this bill right now and
 
07:32:26.750 --> 07:32:26.760 align:start position:0%
we might not see it in this room but
 
07:32:28.590 --> 07:32:28.600 align:start position:0%
they are absolutely against the defend
 
07:32:31.628 --> 07:32:31.638 align:start position:0%
the guard bill because they are I mean
 
07:32:34.270 --> 07:32:34.280 align:start position:0%
their their interests are are uh
 
07:32:37.030 --> 07:32:37.040 align:start position:0%
benefiting from this um so yeah sure
 
07:32:39.070 --> 07:32:39.080 align:start position:0%
APAC Ron they're going to they're going
 
07:32:40.750 --> 07:32:40.760 align:start position:0%
to go on the other side of this and and
 
07:32:42.830 --> 07:32:42.840 align:start position:0%
try to keep incentivizing things even
 
07:32:47.868 --> 07:32:47.878 align:start position:0%
more but truthfully it's not our
 
07:32:50.628 --> 07:32:50.638 align:start position:0%
responsibility what Congress does they
 
07:32:52.590 --> 07:32:52.600 align:start position:0%
are supposed to be representing us and
 
07:32:54.750 --> 07:32:54.760 align:start position:0%
it's very clear that they do not they
 
07:32:58.150 --> 07:32:58.160 align:start position:0%
have not for 83 years so uh you know
 
07:32:59.910 --> 07:32:59.920 align:start position:0%
they they need to uphold the responsib
 
07:33:01.548 --> 07:33:01.558 align:start position:0%
is we need to uphold the Constitution
 
07:33:02.788 --> 07:33:02.798 align:start position:0%
and that's ultimately what this comes
 
07:33:05.670 --> 07:33:05.680 align:start position:0%
down to We Can't dictate what Congress
 
07:33:08.868 --> 07:33:08.878 align:start position:0%
does we can only influence our state's
 
07:33:11.468 --> 07:33:11.478 align:start position:0%
politics and that's why I'm urging every
 
07:33:13.708 --> 07:33:13.718 align:start position:0%
single person here to uphold the
 
07:33:15.270 --> 07:33:15.280 align:start position:0%
Constitution because that is what they
 
07:33:18.388 --> 07:33:18.398 align:start position:0%
 
07:33:21.308 --> 07:33:21.318 align:start position:0%

07:34:25.270 --> 07:34:25.280 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
07:34:33.868 --> 07:34:33.878 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Michael Granger I'm
 
07:34:35.628 --> 07:34:35.638 align:start position:0%
a former Specialist of Al company second
 
07:34:37.750 --> 07:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
108 infantry in the New York National
 
07:34:40.430 --> 07:34:40.440 align:start position:0%
Guard if we pass defend the guard and
 
07:34:43.110 --> 07:34:43.120 align:start position:0%
it's signed it is super easy to get the
 
07:34:45.388 --> 07:34:45.398 align:start position:0%
National Guard to do whatever just
 
07:34:46.788 --> 07:34:46.798 align:start position:0%
declare war which is what they're
 
07:34:48.468 --> 07:34:48.478 align:start position:0%
supposed to be doing anyway it should be
 
07:34:51.270 --> 07:34:51.280 align:start position:0%
really easy if the war is just if the
 
07:34:53.990 --> 07:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
war is just and justifiable it should be
 
07:34:55.670 --> 07:34:55.680 align:start position:0%
easy to get a war declared because the
 
07:34:57.230 --> 07:34:57.240 align:start position:0%
representatives in Congress will be more
 
07:34:59.110 --> 07:34:59.120 align:start position:0%
than happy to do such a thing if it's
 
07:35:02.070 --> 07:35:02.080 align:start position:0%
unjust we should not be playing ball we
 
07:35:04.548 --> 07:35:04.558 align:start position:0%
should not be involved in these wars if
 
07:35:07.788 --> 07:35:07.798 align:start position:0%
they are not just Wars we are Unown
 
07:35:09.910 --> 07:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
under no obligation to help in unjust
 
07:35:12.150 --> 07:35:12.160 align:start position:0%
Wars and if we should not be bought off
 
07:35:14.270 --> 07:35:14.280 align:start position:0%
easily with rockets because it is an
 
07:35:15.948 --> 07:35:15.958 align:start position:0%
insult to the dignity and morality of
 
07:35:17.510 --> 07:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire people to be bought
 
07:35:19.990 --> 07:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
off with rockets especially when the New
 
07:35:21.590 --> 07:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire people are paying for those
 
07:35:23.990 --> 07:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
Rockets these are not gifts from on high
 
07:35:26.030 --> 07:35:26.040 align:start position:0%
the high Mars are paid for with tax
 
07:35:28.868 --> 07:35:28.878 align:start position:0%
dollars those tax dollars are paid for
 
07:35:31.510 --> 07:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
by New Hampshire taxpayers it either
 
07:35:33.468 --> 07:35:33.478 align:start position:0%
comes from their pocket in which case
 
07:35:35.190 --> 07:35:35.200 align:start position:0%
we're just giving them their own Rockets
 
07:35:38.670 --> 07:35:38.680 align:start position:0%
back to them or it is taxed via their
 
07:35:40.510 --> 07:35:40.520 align:start position:0%
savings which is money taken from their
 
07:35:42.350 --> 07:35:42.360 align:start position:0%
savings through inflation by printing at
 
07:35:44.830 --> 07:35:44.840 align:start position:0%
the Federal Reserve it's not free
 
07:35:48.190 --> 07:35:48.200 align:start position:0%
Rockets there's no such thing as a free
 
07:35:50.510 --> 07:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
lunch so I am pleased with New
 
07:35:51.788 --> 07:35:51.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's traditional manner of
 
07:35:54.030 --> 07:35:54.040 align:start position:0%
bucking the feds and doing what we think
 
07:35:56.030 --> 07:35:56.040 align:start position:0%
is right regardless of the carrots and
 
07:35:58.270 --> 07:35:58.280 align:start position:0%
the sticks and if you think that federal
 
07:36:00.230 --> 07:36:00.240 align:start position:0%
law can override the con
 
07:36:02.910 --> 07:36:02.920 align:start position:0%
as may be considered the case based on
 
07:36:04.670 --> 07:36:04.680 align:start position:0%
some testimony that was provided it
 
07:36:06.190 --> 07:36:06.200 align:start position:0%
stands to reason that New Hampshire law
 
07:36:08.750 --> 07:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
can override federal law because we're
 
07:36:10.750 --> 07:36:10.760 align:start position:0%
doing everything backwards now so I
 
07:36:12.910 --> 07:36:12.920 align:start position:0%
didn't swear an oath and neither did you
 
07:36:16.110 --> 07:36:16.120 align:start position:0%
to uphold and defend Federal funding I
 
07:36:17.548 --> 07:36:17.558 align:start position:0%
swore no to the
 
07:36:21.190 --> 07:36:21.200 align:start position:0%
Constitution please OTP this Bill thank
 
07:36:24.110 --> 07:36:24.120 align:start position:0%
