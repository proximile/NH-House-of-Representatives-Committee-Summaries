of marac I'm here to introduce House
 
00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:34.360 align:start position:0%
Bill 51 which is an act relative to hemp
 
00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:37.280 align:start position:0%
derived cannabinoids and the and the
 
00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:39.560 align:start position:0%
definition of cannabis and therapeutic
 
00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:42.160 align:start position:0%
cannabis essentially this bill would
 
00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:45.280 align:start position:0%
allow atcs to buy third-party hemp
 
00:07:47.589 --> 00:07:47.599 align:start position:0%
products containing non-intoxicating
 
00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:50.800 align:start position:0%
cannabinoids to use in their products
 
00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:53.000 align:start position:0%
the way the law is currently written an
 
00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
ATC must make products from what they
 
00:07:58.350 --> 00:07:58.360 align:start position:0%
grow by allowing the purchase of
 
00:07:58.360 --> 00:07:59.510 align:start position:0%
grow by allowing the purchase of
thirdparty

00:07:59.510 --> 00:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
thirdparty
 
00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:01.960 align:start position:0%
products it can cut down on expenses
 
00:08:04.149 --> 00:08:04.159 align:start position:0%
which could then be passed on to the
 
00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:06.680 align:start position:0%
patients many therapeutic cannabis
 
00:08:08.909 --> 00:08:08.919 align:start position:0%
patients actively seek out products that
 
00:08:12.149 --> 00:08:12.159 align:start position:0%
are higher in CBD and other non-
 
00:08:14.469 --> 00:08:14.479 align:start position:0%
intoxicating cannabinoids as a way to
 
00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
manage their
 
00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:19.000 align:start position:0%
symptoms House Bill 51 addresses the
 
00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:20.960 align:start position:0%
need for therapeutic dispensaries to
 
00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:23.560 align:start position:0%
access a broader range of cannabis
 
00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:25.800 align:start position:0%
derived products that can then be used
 
00:08:29.469 --> 00:08:29.479 align:start position:0%
to support Medical Treatments while also
 
00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
uring regulatory oversight and safety by
 
00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
expanding the definition of cannabis to
 
00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
include non intoxicating cannabinoids
 
00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:41.200 align:start position:0%
such as CBD and other hemp derived uh
 
00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:43.680 align:start position:0%
compounds the bill provides alternative
 
00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:45.760 align:start position:0%
treatment centers the opportunity to
 
00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:47.640 align:start position:0%
incorporate a wider variety of
 
00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
therapeutic products this is particular
 
00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:52.959 align:start position:0%
beneficial particularly beneficial for
 
00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:56.040 align:start position:0%
patients seeking specific cannabinoids
 
00:08:58.670 --> 00:08:58.680 align:start position:0%
that may be less likely to cause
 
00:09:01.389 --> 00:09:01.399 align:start position:0%
psychoactive effects but still provide
 
00:09:04.389 --> 00:09:04.399 align:start position:0%
relief from conditions like chronic pain
 
00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:06.120 align:start position:0%
anxiety or
 
00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:08.640 align:start position:0%
seizures this bill ensures that these
 
00:09:10.949 --> 00:09:10.959 align:start position:0%
hemp derived cannabinoids and any
 
00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
cannabis concentrates or infused
 
00:09:17.069 --> 00:09:17.079 align:start position:0%
products manufactured from them undergo
 
00:09:19.389 --> 00:09:19.399 align:start position:0%
thorough testing for contaminants and
 
00:09:19.399 --> 00:09:21.150 align:start position:0%
thorough testing for contaminants and
cannabinoid

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:21.160 align:start position:0%
cannabinoid
 
00:09:23.509 --> 00:09:23.519 align:start position:0%
profiles this helps maintain high
 
00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:27.160 align:start position:0%
standards for patient safety and product
 
00:09:30.069 --> 00:09:30.079 align:start position:0%
consistency additionally the Prov Vision
 
00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
prohibiting the use of hemp derived
 
00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
products containing TC over
 
00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
0.3% ensures that these therapeutic
 
00:09:40.069 --> 00:09:40.079 align:start position:0%
products remain non intoxicating
 
00:09:43.269 --> 00:09:43.279 align:start position:0%
aligning with the therapeutic use of the
 
00:09:46.069 --> 00:09:46.079 align:start position:0%
dispensaries overall this legislation
 
00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:48.200 align:start position:0%
allows dispensaries to offer a more
 
00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
diverse range of products ultimately
 
00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:53.000 align:start position:0%
improving patient access to the most
 
00:09:55.509 --> 00:09:55.519 align:start position:0%
appropriate and effective treatments it
 
00:09:57.790 --> 00:09:57.800 align:start position:0%
strikes a balance between expanding
 
00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:00.360 align:start position:0%
therapeutic options and maintaining
 
00:10:03.069 --> 00:10:03.079 align:start position:0%
strict regulatory control to safeguard
 
00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:05.880 align:start position:0%
public health and the and the Integrity
 
00:10:08.509 --> 00:10:08.519 align:start position:0%

you mentioned cannabis day was it a joke
 
00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:26.160 align:start position:0%
or is it an actual thing cannabis day oh
 
00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
it's a joke um
 
00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:31.480 align:start position:0%
it is not an actual thing although I
 
00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:33.880 align:start position:0%
kind of wish it were but no no it's a
 
00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:35.480 align:start position:0%
joke because you'll be seeing me all day
 
00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
long you this is the day they schedule
 
00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:39.269 align:start position:0%
long you this is the day they schedule
cannabis

00:10:39.269 --> 00:10:39.279 align:start position:0%
cannabis
 
00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:42.120 align:start position:0%
bills any other questions yes
 
00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:45.030 align:start position:0%
bills any other questions yes
representative

00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:47.880 align:start position:0%
Lucas thank you Mr chair I just have a
 
00:10:49.629 --> 00:10:49.639 align:start position:0%
couple of questions that are more
 
00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:52.600 align:start position:0%
semantic in nature
 
00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
um removing
 
00:10:59.550 --> 00:10:59.560 align:start position:0%
seeds from the text why is that
 
00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
necessary because the um federal
 
00:11:04.629 --> 00:11:04.639 align:start position:0%
government has declared that seeds are
 
00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:07.480 align:start position:0%
not cannabis because they have 0 point
 
00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:09.800 align:start position:0%
they don't have enough THC in them so
 
00:11:12.509 --> 00:11:12.519 align:start position:0%
they're sort of agnostic so seeds don't
 
00:11:14.949 --> 00:11:14.959 align:start position:0%
really fall under that definition so
 
00:11:18.069 --> 00:11:18.079 align:start position:0%
it's not possibly become intoxicated you
 
00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
can't take seeds and get
 
00:11:22.269 --> 00:11:22.279 align:start position:0%
intoxicated is is that the question
 
00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
right and and any manner correct correct
 
00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:28.230 align:start position:0%
right and and any manner correct correct
thank

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:28.240 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:32.120 align:start position:0%
you another question just representative
 
00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
McGrath how would the testing for
 
00:11:39.509 --> 00:11:39.519 align:start position:0%
contaminants work oh everything um that
 
00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:42.440 align:start position:0%
goes into um a dispensary from a third
 
00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:45.680 align:start position:0%
party would be tested at a state lab um
 
00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:47.160 align:start position:0%
and they have protocol for that right
 
00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
now and then everything that is created
 
00:11:52.389 --> 00:11:52.399 align:start position:0%
every product created from that third
 
00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:54.440 align:start position:0%
party even though it was Prior test or
 
00:11:57.470 --> 00:11:57.480 align:start position:0%
tested priorly um it would be retested
 
00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:01.200 align:start position:0%
by the state lab there's a very um a um
 
00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
strict uh process that's
 
00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:08.320 align:start position:0%
followed and um so the person or the
 
00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:11.160 align:start position:0%
company I'm sorry go ahead followup I
 
00:12:13.829 --> 00:12:13.839 align:start position:0%
wasn't going to say it so I just say
 
00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:15.680 align:start position:0%
followup yeah you just request to follow
 
00:12:17.269 --> 00:12:17.279 align:start position:0%
up if you want have another question you
 
00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
can do
 
00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:22.160 align:start position:0%
this and the company that's buying it
 
00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:26.600 align:start position:0%
pays for the testing oh yeah yeah yep
 
00:12:30.189 --> 00:12:30.199 align:start position:0%
absolutely other questions
 
00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:38.480 align:start position:0%
McKay thank you Mr
 
00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:41.240 align:start position:0%
chairman would you believe that I
 
00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
strongly support this
 
00:12:47.509 --> 00:12:47.519 align:start position:0%
legislation uh because it distinguishes
 
00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
between recreational use of marijuana
 
00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
and medical use and we hear a lot of
 
00:12:59.629 --> 00:12:59.639 align:start position:0%
negativity about marijuana
 
00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:02.240 align:start position:0%
uh recreationally and we don't hear so
 
00:13:06.189 --> 00:13:06.199 align:start position:0%
much about the medical use uh so I think
 
00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:08.680 align:start position:0%
that this is very important
 
00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:11.000 align:start position:0%
legislation um thank you representative
 
00:13:13.829 --> 00:13:13.839 align:start position:0%
and I would absolutely believe um that
 
00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
you believe that um and just um in so
 
00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:20.760 align:start position:0%
for the record also I should have put it
 
00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:22.760 align:start position:0%
out first I am a therapeutic cannabis
 
00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
patient I use cannabis on a daily basis
 
00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:28.480 align:start position:0%
for uh pain control and for cancer
 
00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
related Sy symptoms um you will never
 
00:13:34.069 --> 00:13:34.079 align:start position:0%
see me intoxicated because that's not
 
00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:36.760 align:start position:0%
why I use cannabis I use it in
 
00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:39.240 align:start position:0%
microdoses and it controls my pain it
 
00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:41.480 align:start position:0%
controls my symptoms so that I can get
 
00:13:43.829 --> 00:13:43.839 align:start position:0%
to work and show up and do things like
 
00:13:47.269 --> 00:13:47.279 align:start position:0%
this um so I believe that's an
 
00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:50.240 align:start position:0%
incredibly important distinction we are
 
00:13:52.829 --> 00:13:52.839 align:start position:0%
not talking about adult use here we are
 
00:13:55.389 --> 00:13:55.399 align:start position:0%
talking about therapeutic use for
 
00:13:57.749 --> 00:13:57.759 align:start position:0%
patients thank
 
00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:00.680 align:start position:0%
you other
 
00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:10.749 --> 00:14:10.759 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is former
 
00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:19.189 --> 00:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
knar Thank you Mr chair um and actually
 
00:14:21.749 --> 00:14:21.759 align:start position:0%
I I passed around the testimony for all
 
00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
of the bills that we have that affect
 
00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic cannabis program uh
 
00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:28.600 align:start position:0%
earlier but I also passed around a
 
00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
little fact sheet we put this together
 
00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:33.320 align:start position:0%
because we have a show and tell table
 
00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:36.720 align:start position:0%
downstairs at lunchtime no no free
 
00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
samples though um but that we have a
 
00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:40.880 align:start position:0%
little handout that's a little more
 
00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
abbreviated from this but I realized
 
00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:43.720 align:start position:0%
again there's such a turnover that many
 
00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:45.240 align:start position:0%
people may not know much about this
 
00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:48.040 align:start position:0%
program you know because it came in in
 
00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:50.720 align:start position:0%
2013 statutorily and then was effective
 
00:14:53.069 --> 00:14:53.079 align:start position:0%
in 2016 so the point is this gives you
 
00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:54.680 align:start position:0%
some issues for example the quality
 
00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:56.720 align:start position:0%
testing everything gets tested and the
 
00:14:58.430 --> 00:14:58.440 align:start position:0%
point of this bill is that it will be
 
00:14:59.670 --> 00:14:59.680 align:start position:0%
things will be test tested if they come
 
00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
from outside as well I serve uh well
 
00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:04.720 align:start position:0%
first I was a state rep for six years I
 
00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:07.000 align:start position:0%
serve as the chair of the therapeutic
 
00:15:09.389 --> 00:15:09.399 align:start position:0%
cannabis medical oversight board which
 
00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:11.880 align:start position:0%
was instituted in 2019 uh and
 
00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:13.560 align:start position:0%
statutorily charged with medical
 
00:15:15.749 --> 00:15:15.759 align:start position:0%
oversight of a therapeutic cannabus
 
00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:19.880 align:start position:0%
program and it's composed of uh the D
 
00:15:23.269 --> 00:15:23.279 align:start position:0%
the DHHS medical director a therapedic
 
00:15:26.269 --> 00:15:26.279 align:start position:0%
cannabis patient a representative of an
 
00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:28.600 align:start position:0%
ATC and 10 different medical providers
 
00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:29.480 align:start position:0%
in different
 
00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:31.030 align:start position:0%
in different
Specialties

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
Specialties
 
00:15:33.629 --> 00:15:33.639 align:start position:0%
um the uh the issue is that we do
 
00:15:37.710 --> 00:15:37.720 align:start position:0%
support this uh Bill we voted to do so
 
00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:40.040 align:start position:0%
because cannabis is a complex herb has
 
00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
over 70 cannabinoids and over 450
 
00:15:45.309 --> 00:15:45.319 align:start position:0%
chemical constituents the most common
 
00:15:47.389 --> 00:15:47.399 align:start position:0%
one we all think about is THC that's the
 
00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
intoxicating one but there are many non-
 
00:15:52.309 --> 00:15:52.319 align:start position:0%
intoxicating canabo as well the one the
 
00:15:54.829 --> 00:15:54.839 align:start position:0%
most commonly known as CBD but there's
 
00:15:57.509 --> 00:15:57.519 align:start position:0%
other variations as well and they all
 
00:15:59.350 --> 00:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
have different therapeutic benefits sort
 
00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
of the mix of these plus the things that
 
00:16:04.069 --> 00:16:04.079 align:start position:0%
give the smell which is called the tpin
 
00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
those together have unique effects for
 
00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:08.360 align:start position:0%
each individual an herb is different
 
00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:10.240 align:start position:0%
than you go to the drugstore you get
 
00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:12.440 align:start position:0%
your linil it's one molecule with a
 
00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:15.880 align:start position:0%
bunch of carriers that's it these are uh
 
00:16:17.389 --> 00:16:17.399 align:start position:0%
kind of fashioned together to give
 
00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:20.360 align:start position:0%
different effects and the point is that
 
00:16:22.749 --> 00:16:22.759 align:start position:0%
CBD can be very helpful for patients or
 
00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:23.680 align:start position:0%
they non-
 
00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:26.160 align:start position:0%
intoxicating uh canabo can be very
 
00:16:29.389 --> 00:16:29.399 align:start position:0%
helpful and uh as represented Thomas
 
00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
said the goal in therapeutic cannabis is
 
00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:34.240 align:start position:0%
to get a therapeutic effect without the
 
00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:36.600 align:start position:0%
troubling side effect of euphoria
 
00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:39.160 align:start position:0%
because if you're an 80-year-old who's
 
00:16:40.749 --> 00:16:40.759 align:start position:0%
got pain and it's 2 in the morning get
 
00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
up to go pee you don't need to be stoned
 
00:16:44.309 --> 00:16:44.319 align:start position:0%
it's just not going to work so the
 
00:16:46.309 --> 00:16:46.319 align:start position:0%
bottom line is we don't want Euphoria we
 
00:16:49.389 --> 00:16:49.399 align:start position:0%
don't want sedation so any case we need
 
00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:52.720 align:start position:0%
these other um non- intoxicating canono
 
00:16:55.629 --> 00:16:55.639 align:start position:0%
but because of the uh significant costs
 
00:16:58.949 --> 00:16:58.959 align:start position:0%
and growing that are imposed Upon Our at
 
00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:00.880 align:start position:0%
seas because of the degree of security
 
00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:02.720 align:start position:0%
and indoor growth facilities and so on
 
00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:05.640 align:start position:0%
and so forth um that's all in place
 
00:17:07.909 --> 00:17:07.919 align:start position:0%
because of the intoxicating nature of
 
00:17:10.789 --> 00:17:10.799 align:start position:0%
THC but these non intoxicating
 
00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:13.160 align:start position:0%
intoxicating cannaboids don't need to be
 
00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:16.760 align:start position:0%
that way and hemp is uh is legally is
 
00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:18.280 align:start position:0%
federally legal as long as the
 
00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
concentration of THC within the hemp is
 
00:17:23.829 --> 00:17:23.839 align:start position:0%
less than. 3% and that can just be grown
 
00:17:25.909 --> 00:17:25.919 align:start position:0%
out in a field without all these
 
00:17:27.909 --> 00:17:27.919 align:start position:0%
requirements so it's a lot cheaper to
 
00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:30.280 align:start position:0%
produce and it's a good source of CBD
 
00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:33.080 align:start position:0%
and other non- intoxicating cannabinoids
 
00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
and we we need those to be able to mix
 
00:17:38.789 --> 00:17:38.799 align:start position:0%
with the THC to make the cannabis
 
00:17:40.909 --> 00:17:40.919 align:start position:0%
infused products and the oils and so on
 
00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
and so forth that are sold by the atc's
 
00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:46.120 align:start position:0%
because again the different effects are
 
00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:49.280 align:start position:0%
needed for different people so the hemp
 
00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:50.440 align:start position:0%
since it can be growing much more
 
00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
economically will allow us I'll get I'll
 
00:17:55.789 --> 00:17:55.799 align:start position:0%
wrap up allow us I was doing little
 
00:17:58.070 --> 00:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
explanation stuff that took some time uh
 
00:17:59.669 --> 00:17:59.679 align:start position:0%
they will allow us to to be able to then
 
00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:02.600 align:start position:0%
get that more cheaply will lower costs
 
00:18:04.909 --> 00:18:04.919 align:start position:0%
and that will allow the atcs to have
 
00:18:07.029 --> 00:18:07.039 align:start position:0%
lower cost products and that's important
 
00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:09.440 align:start position:0%
to our patients because cost is a very
 
00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
uh important barrier for many of our
 
00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:14.320 align:start position:0%
patients so given the great need for CBD
 
00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
Rich products we think this is
 
00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
beneficial we voted 7 to zero to support
 
00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:21.720 align:start position:0%
this bill um I'd be glad to take any
 
00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
questions and again I want to invite you
 
00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
to just drop by our table at lunchtime
 
00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:27.880 align:start position:0%
if you wish to learn a little bit more
 
00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:30.640 align:start position:0%
thanks and and that uh thing at
 
00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
lunchtime it at 12 to1 12 to2 or I'm
 
00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:35.960 align:start position:0%
sorry what what what is the exact
 
00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:37.880 align:start position:0%
schedule of the thing oh um I've got
 
00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
some people that are going to be setting
 
00:18:39.909 --> 00:18:39.919 align:start position:0%
it up at about
 
00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
11:30 and we knock off about 1:15 or so
 
00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:45.200 align:start position:0%
whenever the cafeteria start to get
 
00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:47.200 align:start position:0%
empty and I'll I'll hightail it down
 
00:18:48.909 --> 00:18:48.919 align:start position:0%
there as soon as we finish the bills so
 
00:18:50.549 --> 00:18:50.559 align:start position:0%
that I can be down there as well so
 
00:18:54.149 --> 00:18:54.159 align:start position:0%
basically 12 to1 but padded on each end
 
00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
okay great any
 
00:18:59.430 --> 00:18:59.440 align:start position:0%
questions say no questions
 
00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:07.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
H also sign also signed up to speak is
 
00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:11.360 align:start position:0%
Michael Holt from the New Hampshire
 
00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:20.440 align:start position:0%
Services thank you Mr chair members of
 
00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Michael Holt
 
00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
I'm the administrator of the therapeutic
 
00:19:25.549 --> 00:19:25.559 align:start position:0%
cannabis program uh with the Department
 
00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:27.640 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services I've been
 
00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:29.200 align:start position:0%
working with this program since its
 
00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
Inception in
 
00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:32.750 align:start position:0%
Inception in
2013

00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
2013
 
00:19:35.669 --> 00:19:35.679 align:start position:0%
um the um previous speakers presented
 
00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
the bill I don't have too much to add um
 
00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:39.440 align:start position:0%
except that the department does support
 
00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
this bill um Department believes that um
 
00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
the bill will result in increased
 
00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:46.960 align:start position:0%
product options for uh patients that
 
00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
contain these non- intoxic
 
00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:52.400 align:start position:0%
cannabinoids um and uh also lower prices
 
00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
uh for these products as compared to
 
00:19:56.830 --> 00:19:56.840 align:start position:0%
what would be charged if the ATC uh were
 
00:19:58.789 --> 00:19:58.799 align:start position:0%
to produce these cannabinoids on their
 
00:20:02.669 --> 00:20:02.679 align:start position:0%
own um as stated the bill requires all
 
00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
externally source canabo to be uh tested
 
00:20:07.630 --> 00:20:07.640 align:start position:0%
before they're put into a product and
 
00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:09.200 align:start position:0%
those products tested afterwards
 
00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:11.240 align:start position:0%
essentially double testing for uh this
 
00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
this third party um uh these third party
 
00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:18.760 align:start position:0%
canabo um and lastly the administrative
 
00:20:20.909 --> 00:20:20.919 align:start position:0%
resources for uh the department you know
 
00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:23.080 align:start position:0%
rulemaking and inspections um and
 
00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:24.640 align:start position:0%
whatnot basically to enforce compliance
 
00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:26.480 align:start position:0%
with the law U can be absorbed within
 
00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:29.080 align:start position:0%
our budget um so this is we have no
 
00:20:30.669 --> 00:20:30.679 align:start position:0%
issues with the with the with the bill
 
00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:32.320 align:start position:0%
we support the bill we believe it will
 
00:20:35.909 --> 00:20:35.919 align:start position:0%
help uh patients um have lower cost uh
 
00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:39.440 align:start position:0%
prices on a greater array of therapeutic
 
00:20:41.029 --> 00:20:41.039 align:start position:0%
products um I'm happy to answer
 
00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:42.280 align:start position:0%
questions about the program about this
 
00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
bill um and I'll be here all day as well
 
00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:47.720 align:start position:0%
great any
 
00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
McGrath I thank you
 
00:20:58.110 --> 00:20:58.120 align:start position:0%
um is the hemp product have all of the
 
00:20:58.120 --> 00:20:59.310 align:start position:0%
um is the hemp product have all of the
ingredients

00:20:59.310 --> 00:20:59.320 align:start position:0%
ingredients
 
00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
that you're looking for for your
 
00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
patients or is it a do they combine it
 
00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:07.870 align:start position:0%
patients or is it a do they combine it
with

00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:07.880 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:21:11.669 --> 00:21:11.679 align:start position:0%
other cannabis products uh it would be
 
00:21:12.669 --> 00:21:12.679 align:start position:0%
thank you it would be it would be a
 
00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:14.320 align:start position:0%
mixture um I believe there's a speaker
 
00:21:16.549 --> 00:21:16.559 align:start position:0%
from the ATC um coming after me he might
 
00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
be able to speak more to the product
 
00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
offerings um my understanding is that um
 
00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:23.080 align:start position:0%
the the the hemp produces various
 
00:21:25.669 --> 00:21:25.679 align:start position:0%
cannaboids like CBD which is canabidol
 
00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
CBG CBN um and these are in concentrated
 
00:21:32.029 --> 00:21:32.039 align:start position:0%
forms and so the the goal would be for
 
00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:35.000 align:start position:0%
the ATC to produce um a variety of
 
00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
products that contain greater levels of
 
00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
them so a common product would be a
 
00:21:42.909 --> 00:21:42.919 align:start position:0%
ratio product that mixes an equal amount
 
00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:47.480 align:start position:0%
of THC and CBD or a 20 to1 20% you know
 
00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
20 uh ratio of uh you know 20 times CBD
 
00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
versus one part uh therapeutic cannabis
 
00:21:56.510 --> 00:21:56.520 align:start position:0%
so there's a whole range of um of
 
00:21:59.950 --> 00:21:59.960 align:start position:0%
options um that the atcs could make um
 
00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:03.480 align:start position:0%
the point here is that the nontoxin
 
00:22:07.549 --> 00:22:07.559 align:start position:0%
cannaboids can be sourced more cheaply
 
00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:09.080 align:start position:0%
uh than if they were to produce it on
 
00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:11.400 align:start position:0%
their own thus those cost savings would
 
00:22:12.990 --> 00:22:13.000 align:start position:0%
be passed on to patients for these
 
00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
particular products does that answer
 
00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:18.230 align:start position:0%
particular products does that answer
your

00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:20.750 align:start position:0%
 
question

00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:24.760 align:start position:0%
followup uh yes so I I guess the
 
00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:28.240 align:start position:0%
question was if hemp is so much cheaper
 
00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
can can it all be sourced from
 
00:22:34.549 --> 00:22:34.559 align:start position:0%
hemp no because hemp by definition and
 
00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:37.360 align:start position:0%
what makes it legal is that it has under
 
00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:39.510 align:start position:0%
what makes it legal is that it has under
3%

00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
3%
 
00:22:43.149 --> 00:22:43.159 align:start position:0%
THC and THC is an important therapeutic
 
00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:46.200 align:start position:0%
component uh as as
 
00:22:49.029 --> 00:22:49.039 align:start position:0%
well representative
 
00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:52.320 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you Mr chairman and am I
 
00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:55.640 align:start position:0%
correct in understanding that the issue
 
00:22:58.990 --> 00:22:59.000 align:start position:0%
here is because of the security
 
00:23:02.149 --> 00:23:02.159 align:start position:0%
that we require of the growth centers
 
00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
and because we currently require the
 
00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:09.640 align:start position:0%
atcs to grow everything that they sell
 
00:23:12.269 --> 00:23:12.279 align:start position:0%
and they cannot Source it anywhere
 
00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:16.640 align:start position:0%
else that because of the limited grow
 
00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:17.909 align:start position:0%
else that because of the limited grow
space

00:23:17.909 --> 00:23:17.919 align:start position:0%
space
 
00:23:21.549 --> 00:23:21.559 align:start position:0%
available in very controlled
 
00:23:21.559 --> 00:23:23.990 align:start position:0%
available in very controlled
settings

00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
settings
 
00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:26.320 align:start position:0%
um it's
 
00:23:29.390 --> 00:23:29.400 align:start position:0%
impossible even to have the space let
 
00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:34.120 align:start position:0%
alone uh Do It um economically feasibly
 
00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:37.320 align:start position:0%
to have the widest range of products
 
00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
available for patients who need
 
00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
different arrays and who need their
 
00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
products tailored very carefully to
 
00:23:49.269 --> 00:23:49.279 align:start position:0%
their own specific
 
00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:51.080 align:start position:0%
needs representative Weber you're
 
00:23:52.990 --> 00:23:53.000 align:start position:0%
hitting on a lot of the issues uh and a
 
00:23:54.669 --> 00:23:54.679 align:start position:0%
lot of the components of the program and
 
00:23:58.430 --> 00:23:58.440 align:start position:0%
the regulations around uh atcs um again
 
00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
representative of the ATC will be uh
 
00:24:01.870 --> 00:24:01.880 align:start position:0%
speaking uh next and he can perhaps
 
00:24:06.789 --> 00:24:06.799 align:start position:0%
answer more clearly but um but yes um
 
00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:10.120 align:start position:0%
the atcs currently grow CBD Rich strains
 
00:24:12.510 --> 00:24:12.520 align:start position:0%
of cannabis um but they can tell you
 
00:24:15.149 --> 00:24:15.159 align:start position:0%
that those plants are not as productive
 
00:24:17.669 --> 00:24:17.679 align:start position:0%
say so they're not getting as much CBD
 
00:24:21.549 --> 00:24:21.559 align:start position:0%
out of um the plants as uh a t THC Rich
 
00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:24.200 align:start position:0%
plant for instance and so because of the
 
00:24:26.389 --> 00:24:26.399 align:start position:0%
limited grow space that they have and
 
00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:29.200 align:start position:0%
the and the cost for operating you know
 
00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:32.480 align:start position:0%
each grow room um there the the the cost
 
00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
incentive of of growing and producing as
 
00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:40.480 align:start position:0%
much CBD uh that patients might want is
 
00:24:43.669 --> 00:24:43.679 align:start position:0%
is is a challenge um and so this would
 
00:24:45.909 --> 00:24:45.919 align:start position:0%
this again this would allow uh the atcs
 
00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:49.080 align:start position:0%
to Source these nontoxin cannabinoids
 
00:24:50.830 --> 00:24:50.840 align:start position:0%
and not grow them and not use their
 
00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:53.440 align:start position:0%
precious you know grow spacee um to grow
 
00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
the plants that produce um these high
 
00:24:59.190 --> 00:24:59.200 align:start position:0%
levels of uh nontoxin cannabinoid
 
00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:02.360 align:start position:0%
thank you representative kall thank you
 
00:25:03.669 --> 00:25:03.679 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
question so following on uh
 
00:25:08.350 --> 00:25:08.360 align:start position:0%
representative McGrath's question um
 
00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:10.640 align:start position:0%
this committee heard uh substantial
 
00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:14.440 align:start position:0%
concerns last year uh with respect to
 
00:25:17.470 --> 00:25:17.480 align:start position:0%
some of the synthetic cannaboids so U
 
00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
Delta 8 Delta 9 variants my
 
00:25:22.110 --> 00:25:22.120 align:start position:0%
understanding is that this bill would do
 
00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:24.600 align:start position:0%
nothing to allow the introduction of
 
00:25:28.549 --> 00:25:28.559 align:start position:0%
those into uh the medical cannabis um
 
00:25:31.389 --> 00:25:31.399 align:start position:0%
dispensaries essentially uh this would
 
00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
this this would continue to protect
 
00:25:35.710 --> 00:25:35.720 align:start position:0%
patients against the introduction of
 
00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
synthetic um synthetic cannaboids into
 
00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
into what they're using correct that is
 
00:25:47.909 --> 00:25:47.919 align:start position:0%
that that is correct um hemp derived
 
00:25:51.789 --> 00:25:51.799 align:start position:0%
cannabinoids that contain THC are
 
00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:54.240 align:start position:0%
prohibited under state law uh even
 
00:25:56.789 --> 00:25:56.799 align:start position:0%
though they are widely available um in
 
00:25:59.950 --> 00:25:59.960 align:start position:0%
uh smoke shops gas stations and whatnot
 
00:26:02.549 --> 00:26:02.559 align:start position:0%
this is a this is a separate um effort
 
00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:05.200 align:start position:0%
to allow hemp derived cannabinoids
 
00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:11.200 align:start position:0%
without THC uh to be used by the
 
00:26:14.389 --> 00:26:14.399 align:start position:0%
atc's other
 
00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:17.320 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none okay thank you
 
00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:22.510 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none okay thank you
thank

00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:22.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:25.269 --> 00:26:25.279 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Sue
 
00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:33.640 align:start position:0%
remind us what Sam stands for yes sir um
 
00:26:37.350 --> 00:26:37.360 align:start position:0%
smart approaches to marijuana okay so
 
00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
I'm Sue hola um the New Hampshire
 
00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
chairwoman of uh smart approaches to
 
00:26:44.549 --> 00:26:44.559 align:start position:0%
marijuana which is a national drug abuse
 
00:26:47.710 --> 00:26:47.720 align:start position:0%
prevention organization um I wanted to
 
00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:49.200 align:start position:0%
highlight there are three important
 
00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
issues to consider when discussing uh HB
 
00:26:54.389 --> 00:26:54.399 align:start position:0%
51 number one the federal guidance
 
00:26:57.510 --> 00:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
listed in the 2018 farm bill in the 2022
 
00:27:00.149 --> 00:27:00.159 align:start position:0%
deac seed letter the non-standard
 
00:27:02.510 --> 00:27:02.520 align:start position:0%
federal and state definition of hemp
 
00:27:04.389 --> 00:27:04.399 align:start position:0%
marijuana and cannabis and New
 
00:27:07.269 --> 00:27:07.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's lack of an a USDA approved
 
00:27:10.029 --> 00:27:10.039 align:start position:0%
hemp plan the agriculture Improvement
 
00:27:12.269 --> 00:27:12.279 align:start position:0%
act also called the farm bill of 2018
 
00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:14.360 align:start position:0%
authorized the production of hemp
 
00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:16.480 align:start position:0%
classified hemp as a regul regulated
 
00:27:18.430 --> 00:27:18.440 align:start position:0%
commodity and had a provision to remove
 
00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:20.720 align:start position:0%
hemp and hemp seeds from the DEA admin
 
00:27:23.029 --> 00:27:23.039 align:start position:0%
uh DEA list of controlled
 
00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:26.200 align:start position:0%
substances in 2022 the daa released a
 
00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
letter stating that the seeds containing
 
00:27:30.830 --> 00:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
less than .3% THC meet the definition of
 
00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:32.440 align:start position:0%
hemp and are not considered control
 
00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:35.080 align:start position:0%
substance under federal law however
 
00:27:36.789 --> 00:27:36.799 align:start position:0%
there's still a legal issue require uh
 
00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:38.440 align:start position:0%
regarding the source rule which is a
 
00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:40.120 align:start position:0%
legal theory used to establish the
 
00:27:42.909 --> 00:27:42.919 align:start position:0%
legality of cannabis material based off
 
00:27:45.070 --> 00:27:45.080 align:start position:0%
its source it is understood that if the
 
00:27:46.909 --> 00:27:46.919 align:start position:0%
material comes from hemp it is legal but
 
00:27:48.549 --> 00:27:48.559 align:start position:0%
if it comes from marijuana even if the
 
00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:51.480 align:start position:0%
material contains less than. 3% THC it
 
00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:54.320 align:start position:0%
is illegal according to Legal analysts
 
00:27:56.590 --> 00:27:56.600 align:start position:0%
The Source role became less applicable
 
00:27:58.509 --> 00:27:58.519 align:start position:0%
with regard to seed legality of hemp
 
00:28:01.669 --> 00:28:01.679 align:start position:0%
cultivation after the 2018 Farm Bill
 
00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:03.200 align:start position:0%
however the source role remains in
 
00:28:05.269 --> 00:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
effect with regard to the context of
 
00:28:06.990 --> 00:28:07.000 align:start position:0%
hemp cultivation and processing of
 
00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
products intended for human consumption
 
00:28:13.549 --> 00:28:13.559 align:start position:0%
which HB 51 is intended for in addition
 
00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
the 2022 seed letter does not exempt
 
00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:19.120 align:start position:0%
States from having the uh having a chain
 
00:28:21.389 --> 00:28:21.399 align:start position:0%
of title for the hemp and hemp material
 
00:28:22.990 --> 00:28:23.000 align:start position:0%
they produce and or
 
00:28:25.549 --> 00:28:25.559 align:start position:0%
handle more importantly federal law
 
00:28:29.029 --> 00:28:29.039 align:start position:0%
still use the terms hemp marijuana in US
 
00:28:31.909 --> 00:28:31.919 align:start position:0%
code langu in US code language cannabis
 
00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:33.720 align:start position:0%
is the only is only referred to as a
 
00:28:35.669 --> 00:28:35.679 align:start position:0%
classification of the plant New
 
00:28:37.470 --> 00:28:37.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uses the term cannabis which
 
00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
is the similar to the term marijuana
 
00:28:43.389 --> 00:28:43.399 align:start position:0%
under federal law the 2022 daac letter
 
00:28:46.029 --> 00:28:46.039 align:start position:0%
clarifies the definition of a hemp seed
 
00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:48.120 align:start position:0%
by using terms dis similar to Federal
 
00:28:52.149 --> 00:28:52.159 align:start position:0%
definitions and using the de seed letter
 
00:28:55.710 --> 00:28:55.720 align:start position:0%
um on top of that uh New Hampshire's
 
00:28:59.269 --> 00:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
legal flame framework gets a little bit
 
00:29:01.669 --> 00:29:01.679 align:start position:0%
confusing on another important note many
 
00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:04.600 align:start position:0%
states have a USDA approved state plan
 
00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:07.080 align:start position:0%
to regulate the processing of hemp and
 
00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
the production of finished products to
 
00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:11.200 align:start position:0%
include the products intended for human
 
00:29:13.789 --> 00:29:13.799 align:start position:0%
consumption these plans also outline the
 
00:29:16.029 --> 00:29:16.039 align:start position:0%
states hemp sourcing policies to ensure
 
00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:18.480 align:start position:0%
the source rule is legally followed
 
00:29:20.509 --> 00:29:20.519 align:start position:0%
currently New Hampshire does not have a
 
00:29:22.630 --> 00:29:22.640 align:start position:0%
USDA approved state plan for hemp
 
00:29:25.549 --> 00:29:25.559 align:start position:0%
production it only has a USDA hemp
 
00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:28.320 align:start position:0%
producer license so it stand New
 
00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:30.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's recommendation that the New
 
00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:32.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire consider aligning their
 
00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
definitions for hemp and marijuana to
 
00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
align with Federal uh us code so that
 
00:29:39.549 --> 00:29:39.559 align:start position:0%
Federal guidance can be implemented with
 
00:29:41.789 --> 00:29:41.799 align:start position:0%
maximum Clarity and also be more prudent
 
00:29:43.389 --> 00:29:43.399 align:start position:0%
to outline New Hampshire's hemp
 
00:29:46.389 --> 00:29:46.399 align:start position:0%
production in a USDA approved plan which
 
00:29:48.909 --> 00:29:48.919 align:start position:0%
clearly out outlines our source role
 
00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:51.720 align:start position:0%
procedures before before moving forward
 
00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:54.720 align:start position:0%
with other actions okay thank you
 
00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:56.070 align:start position:0%
with other actions okay thank you
representative

00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:29:58.389 --> 00:29:58.399 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you and thank you for taking
 
00:30:02.149 --> 00:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
my question so uh with all of that being
 
00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:06.120 align:start position:0%
said what and and I understand your your
 
00:30:08.990 --> 00:30:09.000 align:start position:0%
position on what would be helpful if we
 
00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:11.120 align:start position:0%
did it but it's not the bill in front of
 
00:30:13.269 --> 00:30:13.279 align:start position:0%
us what is your position on the bill in
 
00:30:15.870 --> 00:30:15.880 align:start position:0%
front of us that at this time it would
 
00:30:18.269 --> 00:30:18.279 align:start position:0%
that do not go forward do not press
 
00:30:19.909 --> 00:30:19.919 align:start position:0%
ahead with this so you're opposed to the
 
00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
bill at this time I am opposed to the
 
00:30:23.669 --> 00:30:23.679 align:start position:0%
Bill thank
 
00:30:28.389 --> 00:30:28.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:35.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:37.710 --> 00:30:37.720 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Matt
 
00:30:50.549 --> 00:30:50.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:53.149 --> 00:30:53.159 align:start position:0%
cannabis good morning good morning Mr
 
00:30:55.789 --> 00:30:55.799 align:start position:0%
chairman honorable committee good to see
 
00:30:59.310 --> 00:30:59.320 align:start position:0%
some new faces and many Amar faces for
 
00:31:01.509 --> 00:31:01.519 align:start position:0%
the record Matt Simon I work for granite
 
00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:03.440 align:start position:0%
Leaf cannabis we one of the three
 
00:31:05.950 --> 00:31:05.960 align:start position:0%
companies that's licensed to operate
 
00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
alternative treatment centers in New
 
00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:10.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have a grow facility in
 
00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
Peterborough and two dispensaries one in
 
00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:15.720 align:start position:0%
marac one in
 
00:31:18.430 --> 00:31:18.440 align:start position:0%
Chichester um most of what I was going
 
00:31:21.509 --> 00:31:21.519 align:start position:0%
to say has already been said very well
 
00:31:23.509 --> 00:31:23.519 align:start position:0%
uh to partially answer your question
 
00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:25.240 align:start position:0%
representative McGrath we currently
 
00:31:28.669 --> 00:31:28.679 align:start position:0%
offer a number of products that are
 
00:31:32.789 --> 00:31:32.799 align:start position:0%
either just CBD products or are as was
 
00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
previously mentioned CBD ratio products
 
00:31:38.669 --> 00:31:38.679 align:start position:0%
so for example a fruit chew we don't
 
00:31:40.990 --> 00:31:41.000 align:start position:0%
call them gummies because to some people
 
00:31:42.509 --> 00:31:42.519 align:start position:0%
that sounds like candy so they're called
 
00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
Fruit Chews if you look at our menu you
 
00:31:48.230 --> 00:31:48.240 align:start position:0%
can find fruit shoes that contain THC
 
00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:50.080 align:start position:0%
you can find fruit shoes that contain
 
00:31:52.629 --> 00:31:52.639 align:start position:0%
just CBD you can find fruit shoes that
 
00:31:57.149 --> 00:31:57.159 align:start position:0%
contain CBD and THC in a one:1 ratio we
 
00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
also offer ures that include THC in
 
00:32:03.710 --> 00:32:03.720 align:start position:0%
ratio with CBD and other cannabinoids
 
00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:06.320 align:start position:0%
one of our tinctures includes CBD and
 
00:32:08.509 --> 00:32:08.519 align:start position:0%
CBG which is
 
00:32:11.389 --> 00:32:11.399 align:start position:0%
cannabol uh basically for all the time
 
00:32:14.789 --> 00:32:14.799 align:start position:0%
that I worked on this issue uh it was
 
00:32:17.629 --> 00:32:17.639 align:start position:0%
understood incorrectly that the main
 
00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:20.240 align:start position:0%
ingredient in cannabis is THC and that's
 
00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
the active ingredient it turns out there
 
00:32:23.789 --> 00:32:23.799 align:start position:0%
are over a 100
 
00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:26.720 align:start position:0%
canabo uh that have shown great
 
00:32:28.789 --> 00:32:28.799 align:start position:0%
potential in research Arch and in the
 
00:32:31.870 --> 00:32:31.880 align:start position:0%
patient population so as you know we
 
00:32:33.310 --> 00:32:33.320 align:start position:0%
have a therapeutic cannabis medical
 
00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:35.200 align:start position:0%
oversight board a number of providers on
 
00:32:37.549 --> 00:32:37.559 align:start position:0%
that board specifically are very
 
00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:40.720 align:start position:0%
interested in seeing the atcs offer more
 
00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:45.240 align:start position:0%
CBD and CBD ratio products uh so much of
 
00:32:46.710 --> 00:32:46.720 align:start position:0%
the research that's been happening
 
00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
that's very promising is not Research
 
00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
into just the effects of THC it's
 
00:32:53.230 --> 00:32:53.240 align:start position:0%
Research into how people are responding
 
00:32:57.830 --> 00:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
to various canabo uh so thanks to the
 
00:32:59.710 --> 00:32:59.720 align:start position:0%
Federal legalization of hemp which has
 
00:33:01.509 --> 00:33:01.519 align:start position:0%
created a lot of complications the feds
 
00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:03.960 align:start position:0%
have not bothered to regulate hemp so
 
00:33:06.269 --> 00:33:06.279 align:start position:0%
it's Fallen to the states and most H
 
00:33:08.509 --> 00:33:08.519 align:start position:0%
markets are not well regulated so the
 
00:33:11.310 --> 00:33:11.320 align:start position:0%
way this bill is written uh atc's could
 
00:33:15.509 --> 00:33:15.519 align:start position:0%
purchase CBD oil for example in bulk we
 
00:33:17.310 --> 00:33:17.320 align:start position:0%
would have to send it to our independent
 
00:33:19.590 --> 00:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
lab that tests all of our other cannabis
 
00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:22.840 align:start position:0%
products they would have to certify that
 
00:33:25.269 --> 00:33:25.279 align:start position:0%
that oil is what it that it's free from
 
00:33:27.509 --> 00:33:27.519 align:start position:0%
impurities and it is what it says it is
 
00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
and we could then use that oil to make
 
00:33:32.789 --> 00:33:32.799 align:start position:0%
products like the tinctures and the
 
00:33:36.870 --> 00:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
fruit shoes that I've just mentioned so
 
00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:40.440 align:start position:0%
we do currently grow CBD in house uh
 
00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:41.230 align:start position:0%
we do currently grow CBD in house uh
that's

00:33:41.230 --> 00:33:41.240 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:33:44.190 --> 00:33:44.200 align:start position:0%
been I'd hate to calculate the expense
 
00:33:47.029 --> 00:33:47.039 align:start position:0%
of doing it indoors under high-intensity
 
00:33:49.870 --> 00:33:49.880 align:start position:0%
lighting versus what's happening uh
 
00:33:51.389 --> 00:33:51.399 align:start position:0%
thousands of hemp producers in the
 
00:33:54.509 --> 00:33:54.519 align:start position:0%
United States are growing fields of hemp
 
00:33:56.710 --> 00:33:56.720 align:start position:0%
and producing these
 
00:33:59.710 --> 00:33:59.720 align:start position:0%
products we're trying to bridge the gap
 
00:34:01.909 --> 00:34:01.919 align:start position:0%
of the regulation by buying these
 
00:34:03.870 --> 00:34:03.880 align:start position:0%
products that may or may not have been
 
00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
properly properly regulated we're going
 
00:34:08.109 --> 00:34:08.119 align:start position:0%
to get them lab tested and then we're
 
00:34:09.790 --> 00:34:09.800 align:start position:0%
going to have the products we make from
 
00:34:11.589 --> 00:34:11.599 align:start position:0%
them tested before we can sell them to
 
00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:14.720 align:start position:0%
patients so please support the bill
 
00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions thank you
 
00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:18.069 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions thank you
representative

00:34:18.069 --> 00:34:18.079 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:34:21.829 --> 00:34:21.839 align:start position:0%
Weber am I correct in understanding that
 
00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
because of the rigorous testing that you
 
00:34:27.790 --> 00:34:27.800 align:start position:0%
must undergo both at purchase and once
 
00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
the product is
 
00:34:33.829 --> 00:34:33.839 align:start position:0%
formulated that this is far more
 
00:34:36.430 --> 00:34:36.440 align:start position:0%
controlled and far more in the best
 
00:34:38.909 --> 00:34:38.919 align:start position:0%
interest of patients than the things you
 
00:34:42.149 --> 00:34:42.159 align:start position:0%
can buy in the local gas station which
 
00:34:45.349 --> 00:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
are not regulated or are regulated but
 
00:34:47.790 --> 00:34:47.800 align:start position:0%
certainly not as subject subject to as
 
00:34:50.030 --> 00:34:50.040 align:start position:0%
rigorous testing yeah thank you for the
 
00:34:51.869 --> 00:34:51.879 align:start position:0%
question representative wether there are
 
00:34:55.270 --> 00:34:55.280 align:start position:0%
a lot of hemp derived products available
 
00:34:57.270 --> 00:34:57.280 align:start position:0%
some in gas stations I hope that's not
 
00:34:58.510 --> 00:34:58.520 align:start position:0%
happening as much because that is
 
00:35:00.390 --> 00:35:00.400 align:start position:0%
illegal in New Hampshire uh but
 
00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:03.240 align:start position:0%
certainly online and people are finding
 
00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:04.720 align:start position:0%
these products patients are finding
 
00:35:06.349 --> 00:35:06.359 align:start position:0%
these products and they're buying these
 
00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
products and some of them are working
 
00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:10.240 align:start position:0%
great and we just don't know what's in
 
00:35:12.270 --> 00:35:12.280 align:start position:0%
them unless somebody's actually tested
 
00:35:15.990 --> 00:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
them and for New Hampshire patients
 
00:35:18.870 --> 00:35:18.880 align:start position:0%
having access to a regulated source of
 
00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:19.750 align:start position:0%
having access to a regulated source of
of

00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:21.720 align:start position:0%
cannabinoids therapeutic cannabis should
 
00:35:23.349 --> 00:35:23.359 align:start position:0%
be about more than just THC and this

00:50:30.549 --> 00:50:30.559 align:start position:0%
Thomas and I represent the town of marac
 
00:50:32.990 --> 00:50:33.000 align:start position:0%
I'm here to introduce House Bill 53
 
00:50:35.109 --> 00:50:35.119 align:start position:0%
which is an act permitting qualifying
 
00:50:37.589 --> 00:50:37.599 align:start position:0%
patients and designated caregivers to
 
00:50:40.470 --> 00:50:40.480 align:start position:0%
cultivate cannabis for therapeutic use I
 
00:50:44.270 --> 00:50:44.280 align:start position:0%
have passed out two documents uh one is
 
00:50:46.349 --> 00:50:46.359 align:start position:0%
some background on the Cannabis home
 
00:50:49.270 --> 00:50:49.280 align:start position:0%
cultivation laws in New England and the
 
00:50:52.470 --> 00:50:52.480 align:start position:0%
second one is the home cultivation of
 
00:50:57.710 --> 00:50:57.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:02.390 --> 00:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
yeah you're welcome done with that um uh
 
00:51:04.910 --> 00:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
this is not the first rodeo for this
 
00:51:07.190 --> 00:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
bill similar bills have been passed by
 
00:51:11.710 --> 00:51:11.720 align:start position:0%
the house in 2021 2023 and
 
00:51:15.630 --> 00:51:15.640 align:start position:0%
2024 so why do we need this bill first
 
00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
of all cost cannabis is not covered by
 
00:51:21.549 --> 00:51:21.559 align:start position:0%
insurance if you are a patient who uses
 
00:51:23.390 --> 00:51:23.400 align:start position:0%
a lot to keep your symptoms under
 
00:51:26.670 --> 00:51:26.680 align:start position:0%
control it can be expensive and remember
 
00:51:29.510 --> 00:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
this is a vulnerable population many of
 
00:51:33.670 --> 00:51:33.680 align:start position:0%
us are unable to hold jobs house bills
 
00:51:37.150 --> 00:51:37.160 align:start position:0%
uh 53 helps lowincome immobile or
 
00:51:39.470 --> 00:51:39.480 align:start position:0%
homebound patients who need medical
 
00:51:41.750 --> 00:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
cannabis be able to grow their own
 
00:51:44.190 --> 00:51:44.200 align:start position:0%
medicine or to get help doing
 
00:51:47.670 --> 00:51:47.680 align:start position:0%
so dispensary locations there are seven
 
00:51:50.589 --> 00:51:50.599 align:start position:0%
dispensaries in all of New Hampshire not
 
00:51:53.109 --> 00:51:53.119 align:start position:0%
all patients have cars or an affordable
 
00:51:55.910 --> 00:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
way to get to them just to put that into
 
00:51:58.390 --> 00:51:58.400 align:start position:0%
perspective we have five pharmacies in
 
00:51:59.710 --> 00:51:59.720 align:start position:0%
my town of
 
00:52:03.109 --> 00:52:03.119 align:start position:0%
miramac strains everyone reacts
 
00:52:05.910 --> 00:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
differently to cannabis strains what may
 
00:52:08.309 --> 00:52:08.319 align:start position:0%
work for one patient may not be as
 
00:52:11.190 --> 00:52:11.200 align:start position:0%
effective as effective for another
 
00:52:12.789 --> 00:52:12.799 align:start position:0%
sometimes the strain that works best for
 
00:52:15.870 --> 00:52:15.880 align:start position:0%
you might be discontinued growing that
 
00:52:18.670 --> 00:52:18.680 align:start position:0%
would be a good option the New Hampshire
 
00:52:20.589 --> 00:52:20.599 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program began in
 
00:52:24.390 --> 00:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
2013 it is 12 years old since it began
 
00:52:26.069 --> 00:52:26.079 align:start position:0%
we have learned a lot about the program
 
00:52:28.910 --> 00:52:28.920 align:start position:0%
and patient needs dispensaries have been
 
00:52:31.030 --> 00:52:31.040 align:start position:0%
added along the way with more
 
00:52:33.430 --> 00:52:33.440 align:start position:0%
qualifications to get into the program
 
00:52:35.069 --> 00:52:35.079 align:start position:0%
and the program has been modified to
 
00:52:36.670 --> 00:52:36.680 align:start position:0%
better suit patients
 
00:52:40.750 --> 00:52:40.760 align:start position:0%
needs since 2009 the New Hampshire house
 
00:52:43.309 --> 00:52:43.319 align:start position:0%
has consistently supported bills
 
00:52:45.109 --> 00:52:45.119 align:start position:0%
allowing patients with qualifying
 
00:52:47.950 --> 00:52:47.960 align:start position:0%
medical conditions and their caregivers
 
00:52:50.349 --> 00:52:50.359 align:start position:0%
to cultivate a limited supply of
 
00:52:54.870 --> 00:52:54.880 align:start position:0%
cannabis in 2012 and 2019 the Senate
 
00:52:58.030 --> 00:52:58.040 align:start position:0%
agreed advancing home legislation to the
 
00:53:00.950 --> 00:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
governor's desk both bills were vetoed
 
00:53:02.990 --> 00:53:03.000 align:start position:0%
and the override efforts fell short in
 
00:53:06.470 --> 00:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
the senate in 2020 the Senate passed a
 
00:53:09.270 --> 00:53:09.280 align:start position:0%
homow bill and a Voice vote but the
 
00:53:11.470 --> 00:53:11.480 align:start position:0%
outbreak of covid-19 prevented it from
 
00:53:14.349 --> 00:53:14.359 align:start position:0%
being considered in the house what this
 
00:53:18.109 --> 00:53:18.119 align:start position:0%
bill does HB 53 allows New Hampshire
 
00:53:20.950 --> 00:53:20.960 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis patients or care G
 
00:53:23.990 --> 00:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
givers to grow their own cannabis plants
 
00:53:26.549 --> 00:53:26.559 align:start position:0%
at their place of residence within guard
 
00:53:29.630 --> 00:53:29.640 align:start position:0%
rails set forward by this bill patients
 
00:53:31.549 --> 00:53:31.559 align:start position:0%
are still Bound by the guidelines of the
 
00:53:33.710 --> 00:53:33.720 align:start position:0%
program as identified when you submit or
 
00:53:35.190 --> 00:53:35.200 align:start position:0%
renew your
 
00:53:37.789 --> 00:53:37.799 align:start position:0%
application if grown outside the plants
 
00:53:40.309 --> 00:53:40.319 align:start position:0%
cannot be viewed from another private
 
00:53:42.589 --> 00:53:42.599 align:start position:0%
property it would allow New Hampshire
 
00:53:44.230 --> 00:53:44.240 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis patients to have
 
00:53:46.670 --> 00:53:46.680 align:start position:0%
and grow Three Mature which are

which are identified at 6 in or less
 
00:53:58.230 --> 00:53:58.240 align:start position:0%
patients can grow the plants from seeds
 
00:53:59.870 --> 00:53:59.880 align:start position:0%
and some of the dispensaries have said
 
00:54:01.870 --> 00:54:01.880 align:start position:0%
that they would be willing and able to
 
00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:02.789 align:start position:0%
that they would be willing and able to
provide

00:54:02.789 --> 00:54:02.799 align:start position:0%
provide
 
00:54:05.670 --> 00:54:05.680 align:start position:0%
seedlings the plants must be kept in a
 
00:54:07.589 --> 00:54:07.599 align:start position:0%
locked and secured location that is
 
00:54:10.549 --> 00:54:10.559 align:start position:0%
reported to the state the patient must
 
00:54:13.309 --> 00:54:13.319 align:start position:0%
ensure that the plants are secured from
 
00:54:16.510 --> 00:54:16.520 align:start position:0%
unauthorized access patients would have
 
00:54:19.069 --> 00:54:19.079 align:start position:0%
access to State Labs for testing or
 
00:54:21.510 --> 00:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
independent Labs as well for testing of
 
00:54:24.230 --> 00:54:24.240 align:start position:0%
cannabinoids and possible contamination
 
00:54:26.950 --> 00:54:26.960 align:start position:0%
most probably mold
 
00:54:29.870 --> 00:54:29.880 align:start position:0%
what this bill does not do this bill
 
00:54:32.349 --> 00:54:32.359 align:start position:0%
does not mean that every therapeutic
 
00:54:34.589 --> 00:54:34.599 align:start position:0%
cannabis patient will start growing
 
00:54:36.950 --> 00:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
plants some patients will try and
 
00:54:40.150 --> 00:54:40.160 align:start position:0%
realize it's too much work and will stop
 
00:54:42.549 --> 00:54:42.559 align:start position:0%
some patients will be interested and
 
00:54:44.549 --> 00:54:44.559 align:start position:0%
will simply gather information on how to
 
00:54:47.549 --> 00:54:47.559 align:start position:0%
grow cannabis plants and some people uh
 
00:54:50.190 --> 00:54:50.200 align:start position:0%
some patients will simply say I'd rather
 
00:54:55.069 --> 00:54:55.079 align:start position:0%
buy the flower hp53 does not create
 
00:54:58.349 --> 00:54:58.359 align:start position:0%
dealers or suppliers the therapeutic
 
00:54:59.990 --> 00:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
cannabis program is
 
00:55:02.069 --> 00:55:02.079 align:start position:0%
self-regulating to be in the program you
 
00:55:04.030 --> 00:55:04.040 align:start position:0%
must sign a contract that stipulates
 
00:55:06.510 --> 00:55:06.520 align:start position:0%
limitations on how much cannabis we can
 
00:55:09.589 --> 00:55:09.599 align:start position:0%
have where we can keep it and where we
 
00:55:12.549 --> 00:55:12.559 align:start position:0%
can use it we know that if we disregard
 
00:55:14.910 --> 00:55:14.920 align:start position:0%
these conditions we can be kicked out of
 
00:55:18.109 --> 00:55:18.119 align:start position:0%
the program or we will be pen penalized
 
00:55:21.349 --> 00:55:21.359 align:start position:0%
at a higher rate than others no patient
 
00:55:24.230 --> 00:55:24.240 align:start position:0%
is going to risk that again this is not
 
00:55:26.750 --> 00:55:26.760 align:start position:0%
Recreation this is a medical program for
 
00:55:29.710 --> 00:55:29.720 align:start position:0%
very sick patients it does not create
 
00:55:32.349 --> 00:55:32.359 align:start position:0%
hidden stashes of cannabis growth
 
00:55:34.950 --> 00:55:34.960 align:start position:0%
locations must be reported to the
 
00:55:37.270 --> 00:55:37.280 align:start position:0%
state so what's happening in some of the
 
00:55:38.789 --> 00:55:38.799 align:start position:0%
other states in Connecticut you're
 
00:55:40.589 --> 00:55:40.599 align:start position:0%
allowed up to Three Mature plants and
 
00:55:43.029 --> 00:55:43.039 align:start position:0%
three immature plants in Maine you're
 
00:55:45.630 --> 00:55:45.640 align:start position:0%
allowed up to six flowering plants 12
 
00:55:48.829 --> 00:55:48.839 align:start position:0%
immature plants and unlimited seedlings
 
00:55:51.349 --> 00:55:51.359 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts you can have six plants
 
00:55:54.510 --> 00:55:54.520 align:start position:0%
per person or patient no more than 12 in
 
00:55:56.950 --> 00:55:56.960 align:start position:0%
Rhode Island up to 12 mat M plants and
 
00:55:59.990 --> 00:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
12 immature plants per patient in
 
00:56:02.270 --> 00:56:02.280 align:start position:0%
Vermont up to two mature plants and
 
00:56:05.510 --> 00:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
seven immature plants per patient so who
 
00:56:07.950 --> 00:56:07.960 align:start position:0%
supports this bill this has always been
 
00:56:10.029 --> 00:56:10.039 align:start position:0%
a bipartisan bill that continually
 
00:56:12.750 --> 00:56:12.760 align:start position:0%
passes the house the dispensary support
 
00:56:14.870 --> 00:56:14.880 align:start position:0%
homow and we are ready to roll out
 
00:56:17.990 --> 00:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
classes on how to grow and may even
 
00:56:20.990 --> 00:56:21.000 align:start position:0%
offer some equipment needed to grow the
 
00:56:23.190 --> 00:56:23.200 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis board voted
 
00:56:25.549 --> 00:56:25.559 align:start position:0%
unanimously to support this bill it is
 
00:56:27.750 --> 00:56:27.760 align:start position:0%
seen as economical way to support
 
00:56:30.950 --> 00:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis patients in summary
 
00:56:32.589 --> 00:56:32.599 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire therapeutic program
 
00:56:35.670 --> 00:56:35.680 align:start position:0%
has been alive and well since 2013 and
 
00:56:37.829 --> 00:56:37.839 align:start position:0%
is only getting stronger as we listen to
 
00:56:41.910 --> 00:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
patients needs HB 53 is a compassionate
 
00:56:43.990 --> 00:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
Humane bill that also encourages
 
00:56:46.190 --> 00:56:46.200 align:start position:0%
business growth it's time to let
 
00:56:47.990 --> 00:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
patients take control of their health
 
00:56:50.549 --> 00:56:50.559 align:start position:0%
and wallets by allowing for home growth
 
00:56:52.990 --> 00:56:53.000 align:start position:0%
in the therapeutic program thank you and
 
00:56:56.990 --> 00:56:57.000 align:start position:0%
I'll take questions representative Weber
 
00:56:58.630 --> 00:56:58.640 align:start position:0%
thank you so much and thank you for your
 
00:57:00.510 --> 00:57:00.520 align:start position:0%
thorough explanation and walking us
 
00:57:03.270 --> 00:57:03.280 align:start position:0%
through the bill are there any language
 
00:57:05.390 --> 00:57:05.400 align:start position:0%
changes in this bill from the way the
 
00:57:11.589 --> 00:57:11.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:14.589 --> 00:57:14.599 align:start position:0%
2024 yes and no and and thank you for
 
00:57:17.710 --> 00:57:17.720 align:start position:0%
reminding me the no is that the the the
 
00:57:21.150 --> 00:57:21.160 align:start position:0%
text of the bill Remains the Same um the
 
00:57:23.670 --> 00:57:23.680 align:start position:0%
yes is that page four line 27 has the
 
00:57:25.589 --> 00:57:25.599 align:start position:0%
wrong date it's a drafting error it
 
00:57:29.190 --> 00:57:29.200 align:start position:0%
should be 2024 2025 so that's why the
 
00:57:32.470 --> 00:57:32.480 align:start position:0%
yes and no it is the same text however
 
00:57:35.309 --> 00:57:35.319 align:start position:0%
that date needs to be changed and could
 
00:57:37.270 --> 00:57:37.280 align:start position:0%
you give me that line number again
 
00:57:42.390 --> 00:57:42.400 align:start position:0%
please yes it's page 4 line 27 2005 okay
 
00:57:44.870 --> 00:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
so other other than the date changes the
 
00:57:46.950 --> 00:57:46.960 align:start position:0%
this is the exact same wording that was
 
00:57:49.710 --> 00:57:49.720 align:start position:0%
introduced twice last term so it should
 
00:57:54.150 --> 00:57:54.160 align:start position:0%
say 2025 and we should perhaps obtain an
 
00:57:56.630 --> 00:57:56.640 align:start position:0%
an amend an amendment for one date yes
 
00:57:59.829 --> 00:57:59.839 align:start position:0%
unfortunately yes thank you so much well
 
00:58:01.109 --> 00:58:01.119 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question and for
 
00:58:04.390 --> 00:58:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:07.190 --> 00:58:07.200 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
00:58:09.630 --> 00:58:09.640 align:start position:0%
McKay thank you Mr
 
00:58:13.510 --> 00:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
chairman uh thank you for your
 
00:58:18.870 --> 00:58:18.880 align:start position:0%
work uh one of the concerns I think
 
00:58:21.789 --> 00:58:21.799 align:start position:0%
about this legislation which again I
 
00:58:21.799 --> 00:58:22.910 align:start position:0%
about this legislation which again I
strongly

00:58:22.910 --> 00:58:22.920 align:start position:0%
strongly
 
00:58:22.920 --> 00:58:24.430 align:start position:0%
strongly
support

00:58:24.430 --> 00:58:24.440 align:start position:0%
support
 
00:58:29.589 --> 00:58:29.599 align:start position:0%
is how you prevent the grower from
 
00:58:33.670 --> 00:58:33.680 align:start position:0%
selling uh outside of their own use my
 
00:58:36.029 --> 00:58:36.039 align:start position:0%
understanding is that this is for their
 
00:58:39.910 --> 00:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
own use only correct and but what you
 
00:58:44.390 --> 00:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned briefly some measures to
 
00:58:46.870 --> 00:58:46.880 align:start position:0%
prevent them from selling could you
 
00:58:49.349 --> 00:58:49.359 align:start position:0%
expand on that
 
00:58:52.190 --> 00:58:52.200 align:start position:0%
um I believe um Michael Hol will be
 
00:58:54.549 --> 00:58:54.559 align:start position:0%
testifying after me and he can go into
 
00:58:56.990 --> 00:58:57.000 align:start position:0%
more detail but when you enter the
 
00:58:59.069 --> 00:58:59.079 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program you have to
 
00:59:01.069 --> 00:59:01.079 align:start position:0%
sign essentially a contract that says
 
00:59:03.470 --> 00:59:03.480 align:start position:0%
you will not sell and that you will
 
00:59:06.109 --> 00:59:06.119 align:start position:0%
follow the guidelines um right now in
 
00:59:09.029 --> 00:59:09.039 align:start position:0%
the Cannabis program uh there are higher
 
00:59:11.789 --> 00:59:11.799 align:start position:0%
penalties for therap which I don't think
 
00:59:14.230 --> 00:59:14.240 align:start position:0%
is fair but that's another discussion um
 
00:59:16.670 --> 00:59:16.680 align:start position:0%
for selling so if somebody on the street
 
00:59:18.430 --> 00:59:18.440 align:start position:0%
sold and was arrested they would have
 
00:59:19.870 --> 00:59:19.880 align:start position:0%
one penalty if somebody is in the
 
00:59:21.950 --> 00:59:21.960 align:start position:0%
program and sold they would have a
 
00:59:27.190 --> 00:59:27.200 align:start position:0%
higher penalty um and if you uh sell you
 
00:59:30.029 --> 00:59:30.039 align:start position:0%
are disqualified from the program I mean
 
00:59:31.950 --> 00:59:31.960 align:start position:0%
you could be disqualified from the
 
00:59:35.670 --> 00:59:35.680 align:start position:0%
program which is most of the patients if
 
00:59:38.750 --> 00:59:38.760 align:start position:0%
not all of the patients um respect the
 
00:59:41.710 --> 00:59:41.720 align:start position:0%
program and and want it to continue so
 
00:59:44.950 --> 00:59:44.960 align:start position:0%
that's a high risk and I I think it's
 
00:59:46.910 --> 00:59:46.920 align:start position:0%
you know essentially
 
00:59:51.349 --> 00:59:51.359 align:start position:0%
self-regulating thank you other
 
00:59:53.390 --> 00:59:53.400 align:start position:0%
questions representative Maser and then
 
00:59:53.400 --> 00:59:54.390 align:start position:0%
questions representative Maser and then
representative

00:59:54.390 --> 00:59:54.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:59:57.069 --> 00:59:57.079 align:start position:0%
McGrath yes thank thank you Mr chair
 
00:59:59.630 --> 00:59:59.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here today you so I
 
01:00:02.190 --> 01:00:02.200 align:start position:0%
having never grown cannabis myself or
 
01:00:04.270 --> 01:00:04.280 align:start position:0%
even been around a cannabis plant this
 
01:00:06.309 --> 01:00:06.319 align:start position:0%
may be a a weird question but is there
 
01:00:08.789 --> 01:00:08.799 align:start position:0%
an a stench or an odor that comes in the
 
01:00:11.670 --> 01:00:11.680 align:start position:0%
growth of these plants that could like
 
01:00:13.150 --> 01:00:13.160 align:start position:0%
let's say someone grows it in an
 
01:00:16.829 --> 01:00:16.839 align:start position:0%
apartment building could that affect
 
01:00:21.270 --> 01:00:21.280 align:start position:0%
other people I mean it it's a plant so
 
01:00:23.390 --> 01:00:23.400 align:start position:0%
just like a tomato plant has a smell to
 
01:00:25.670 --> 01:00:25.680 align:start position:0%
it again you're limited in the amount of
 
01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:26.470 align:start position:0%
it again you're limited in the amount of
plant

01:00:26.470 --> 01:00:26.480 align:start position:0%
plant
 
01:00:28.710 --> 01:00:28.720 align:start position:0%
so it's it's not you're not going to
 
01:00:30.630 --> 01:00:30.640 align:start position:0%
walk into an apartment building and say
 
01:00:32.390 --> 01:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
oh my God somebody's growing cannabis
 
01:00:37.109 --> 01:00:37.119 align:start position:0%
here it's it's a mild um a mild smell
 
01:00:39.630 --> 01:00:39.640 align:start position:0%
just like any other plant um
 
01:00:43.789 --> 01:00:43.799 align:start position:0%
and um you have to force the the flow
 
01:00:46.870 --> 01:00:46.880 align:start position:0%
the bud um but you don't get to the
 
01:00:48.150 --> 01:00:48.160 align:start position:0%
flowering so you're not going to have
 
01:00:50.430 --> 01:00:50.440 align:start position:0%
even a perfume or anything like that and
 
01:00:52.710 --> 01:00:52.720 align:start position:0%
it doesn't smell it's an organic smell
 
01:00:55.029 --> 01:00:55.039 align:start position:0%
it's it's like smelling hay or something
 
01:00:56.829 --> 01:00:56.839 align:start position:0%
like that you're not going to get the
 
01:00:58.829 --> 01:00:58.839 align:start position:0%
smell that you smell when somebody
 
01:00:58.839 --> 01:01:00.390 align:start position:0%
smell that you smell when somebody
smokes

01:01:00.390 --> 01:01:00.400 align:start position:0%
smokes
 
01:01:02.670 --> 01:01:02.680 align:start position:0%
it representative McGrath and then
 
01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:04.109 align:start position:0%
it representative McGrath and then
representative

01:01:04.109 --> 01:01:04.119 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:01:07.270 --> 01:01:07.280 align:start position:0%
Nagel hi thank you so I'm a little
 
01:01:09.950 --> 01:01:09.960 align:start position:0%
confused in Maine it says a caregiver
 
01:01:15.670 --> 01:01:15.680 align:start position:0%
may serve up to five patients is the
 
01:01:18.390 --> 01:01:18.400 align:start position:0%
grower the people have to be in the same
 
01:01:21.990 --> 01:01:22.000 align:start position:0%
house or can somebody be growing it for
 
01:01:24.630 --> 01:01:24.640 align:start position:0%
patients in different locations and did
 
01:01:27.990 --> 01:01:28.000 align:start position:0%
that will that be the same in this bill
 
01:01:31.069 --> 01:01:31.079 align:start position:0%
so in New Hampshire you're allowed um to
 
01:01:33.750 --> 01:01:33.760 align:start position:0%
have caregivers and again Michael Hulk
 
01:01:36.710 --> 01:01:36.720 align:start position:0%
can can uh can uh talk about that as
 
01:01:41.670 --> 01:01:41.680 align:start position:0%
well um in Maine uh you can you it's
 
01:01:43.789 --> 01:01:43.799 align:start position:0%
it's like a hub for somebody who can't
 
01:01:46.950 --> 01:01:46.960 align:start position:0%
grow you you have a career Giver who
 
01:01:51.750 --> 01:01:51.760 align:start position:0%
grows for you and so they provide the
 
01:01:55.950 --> 01:01:55.960 align:start position:0%
the material for those five patients
 
01:01:58.750 --> 01:01:58.760 align:start position:0%
so so they're sort of the the manager of
 
01:02:01.670 --> 01:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
the cannabis for those patients if that
 
01:02:04.230 --> 01:02:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:07.549 --> 01:02:07.559 align:start position:0%
sense representative nichel I think that
 
01:02:09.789 --> 01:02:09.799 align:start position:0%
this is a a question of order am I
 
01:02:11.230 --> 01:02:11.240 align:start position:0%
allowed to ask the question that
 
01:02:13.230 --> 01:02:13.240 align:start position:0%
representative misser
 
01:02:15.349 --> 01:02:15.359 align:start position:0%
asked you mean the same question she
 
01:02:18.190 --> 01:02:18.200 align:start position:0%
asked yeah allowed to answer it for her
 
01:02:20.309 --> 01:02:20.319 align:start position:0%
oh sure if you have in insight into the
 
01:02:22.349 --> 01:02:22.359 align:start position:0%
issue sure well I've toured a number of
 
01:02:24.549 --> 01:02:24.559 align:start position:0%
cultivation centers and it smells just
 
01:02:26.829 --> 01:02:26.839 align:start position:0%
like citrus it's like a lot of the
 
01:02:28.870 --> 01:02:28.880 align:start position:0%
bathroom sprays people use and it's
 
01:02:31.390 --> 01:02:31.400 align:start position:0%
actually quite nice it's not like the
 
01:02:34.269 --> 01:02:34.279 align:start position:0%
smoke smell you get it's nothing like
 
01:02:36.230 --> 01:02:36.240 align:start position:0%
that it's actually a lovely smell it it
 
01:02:38.549 --> 01:02:38.559 align:start position:0%
really is I was pleasantly surprised
 
01:02:42.069 --> 01:02:42.079 align:start position:0%
yeah okay um any other
 
01:02:44.589 --> 01:02:44.599 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative Palmer I
 
01:02:47.390 --> 01:02:47.400 align:start position:0%
mean representative Mel I'm
 
01:02:50.190 --> 01:02:50.200 align:start position:0%
sorry turn on your mic microphone sorry
 
01:02:52.710 --> 01:02:52.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so um
 
01:02:54.710 --> 01:02:54.720 align:start position:0%
you're mentioning the different states
 
01:02:56.430 --> 01:02:56.440 align:start position:0%
here that have
 
01:03:00.390 --> 01:03:00.400 align:start position:0%
um uh various permit permit levels for
 
01:03:02.349 --> 01:03:02.359 align:start position:0%
this can you talk to us a little bit
 
01:03:04.549 --> 01:03:04.559 align:start position:0%
about the the regulations and how
 
01:03:07.670 --> 01:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
they're handling it by each
 
01:03:10.029 --> 01:03:10.039 align:start position:0%
state I'm not sure I'm the best person
 
01:03:13.789 --> 01:03:13.799 align:start position:0%
to answer that um I focus on the New
 
01:03:16.109 --> 01:03:16.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um okay so I mean I'm just
 
01:03:18.109 --> 01:03:18.119 align:start position:0%
looking at it and it says Maine has some
 
01:03:20.349 --> 01:03:20.359 align:start position:0%
regulations Massachusetts I think it's
 
01:03:22.910 --> 01:03:22.920 align:start position:0%
different uh Rhode Island Vermont all of
 
01:03:27.230 --> 01:03:27.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:28.910 --> 01:03:28.920 align:start position:0%
I I'm not sure I'm the person to answer
 
01:03:32.510 --> 01:03:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:34.789 --> 01:03:34.799 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
01:03:37.230 --> 01:03:37.240 align:start position:0%
merer thank you um so you said you
 
01:03:39.470 --> 01:03:39.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned they have a card um that
 
01:03:41.470 --> 01:03:41.480 align:start position:0%
they're given does that enter Then enter
 
01:03:43.829 --> 01:03:43.839 align:start position:0%
them into a registry that the state
 
01:03:47.470 --> 01:03:47.480 align:start position:0%
police can randomly show up and check
 
01:03:50.670 --> 01:03:50.680 align:start position:0%
then yes it does oh I'm seeing heads
 
01:03:55.069 --> 01:03:55.079 align:start position:0%
shaking back there oh okay that's I I
 
01:03:56.589 --> 01:03:56.599 align:start position:0%
was under the Imp question that there
 
01:03:59.430 --> 01:03:59.440 align:start position:0%
was a well okay somebody behind me will
 
01:04:01.109 --> 01:04:01.119 align:start position:0%
will answer that question better than me
 
01:04:02.269 --> 01:04:02.279 align:start position:0%
because apparently I don't have the
 
01:04:06.069 --> 01:04:06.079 align:start position:0%
right answer okay other questions yes
 
01:04:08.349 --> 01:04:08.359 align:start position:0%
representative Woods oh thank you Mr
 
01:04:10.390 --> 01:04:10.400 align:start position:0%
chair thanks for taking my question uh
 
01:04:11.950 --> 01:04:11.960 align:start position:0%
you mentioned testing and I'm just
 
01:04:14.750 --> 01:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
scanning here uh what is the role of you
 
01:04:17.710 --> 01:04:17.720 align:start position:0%
are the Growers required to have their
 
01:04:20.390 --> 01:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
product tested or did I hear you say
 
01:04:24.230 --> 01:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
they just have they can test it and have
 
01:04:26.789 --> 01:04:26.799 align:start position:0%
availability to other facilities to get
 
01:04:28.829 --> 01:04:28.839 align:start position:0%
that accomplished they have the option
 
01:04:30.670 --> 01:04:30.680 align:start position:0%
okay it is not required and
 
01:04:32.269 --> 01:04:32.279 align:start position:0%
representative your your bandage is
 
01:04:34.589 --> 01:04:34.599 align:start position:0%
coming a little loose on your head oh my
 
01:04:38.230 --> 01:04:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:40.349 --> 01:04:40.359 align:start position:0%
well you're
 
01:04:44.069 --> 01:04:44.079 align:start position:0%
good thank you uh representative
 
01:04:47.589 --> 01:04:47.599 align:start position:0%
Lucas thank you Mr chair just a question
 
01:04:52.950 --> 01:04:52.960 align:start position:0%
about the um growing phase of plants and
 
01:04:56.390 --> 01:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
what's changed from seed
 
01:05:00.750 --> 01:05:00.760 align:start position:0%
to immature cannabis that's line
 
01:05:03.950 --> 01:05:03.960 align:start position:0%
30 on page
 
01:05:09.390 --> 01:05:09.400 align:start position:0%
five um my question is uh from by
 
01:05:12.069 --> 01:05:12.079 align:start position:0%
changing from seedlings to immature
 
01:05:14.470 --> 01:05:14.480 align:start position:0%
cannabis does that
 
01:05:17.589 --> 01:05:17.599 align:start position:0%
increase the amount of therapeutic
 
01:05:21.029 --> 01:05:21.039 align:start position:0%
cannabis permitted and if there's an
 
01:05:23.750 --> 01:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
excess Beyond what's
 
01:05:29.910 --> 01:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:36.789 --> 01:05:36.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:43.109 --> 01:05:43.119 align:start position:0%
um you're line 30 is referring to um the
 
01:05:46.549 --> 01:05:46.559 align:start position:0%
atcs with aiding mature um cannabis
 
01:05:50.829 --> 01:05:50.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:53.190 --> 01:05:53.200 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure I have the answer to
 
01:05:55.309 --> 01:05:55.319 align:start position:0%
that question either and so I'm going to
 
01:05:57.269 --> 01:05:57.279 align:start position:0%
different refer to someone from the
 
01:06:01.230 --> 01:06:01.240 align:start position:0%
ATC um but a patient would never have 0
 
01:06:03.829 --> 01:06:03.839 align:start position:0%
plants MH I mean this is the ATC they're
 
01:06:05.390 --> 01:06:05.400 align:start position:0%
talking about not a patient yeah I'm
 
01:06:07.510 --> 01:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
sorry I jumped ahead so um and and
 
01:06:10.470 --> 01:06:10.480 align:start position:0%
that's fine but um you know uh the the
 
01:06:12.190 --> 01:06:12.200 align:start position:0%
patient is allowed to have uh Three
 
01:06:14.230 --> 01:06:14.240 align:start position:0%
Mature plants
 
01:06:17.269 --> 01:06:17.279 align:start position:0%
so you're not going to get a you're
 
01:06:18.750 --> 01:06:18.760 align:start position:0%
going to get a significant amount of
 
01:06:20.390 --> 01:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
cannabis but you're not going to get you
 
01:06:22.069 --> 01:06:22.079 align:start position:0%
know buckets and buckets and buckets of
 
01:06:25.630 --> 01:06:25.640 align:start position:0%
cannabis buds because you you the the
 
01:06:28.549 --> 01:06:28.559 align:start position:0%
part that most people are interested in
 
01:06:31.349 --> 01:06:31.359 align:start position:0%
is the actual bud that's where the THC
 
01:06:33.870 --> 01:06:33.880 align:start position:0%
crystals are so it's not the plant
 
01:06:36.269 --> 01:06:36.279 align:start position:0%
itself it's the buds and some plants Bud
 
01:06:38.670 --> 01:06:38.680 align:start position:0%
more than other
 
01:06:41.829 --> 01:06:41.839 align:start position:0%
plants other
 
01:06:44.029 --> 01:06:44.039 align:start position:0%
questions I I actually have a question
 
01:06:46.870 --> 01:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas sure and this is I
 
01:06:48.710 --> 01:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
know speculative and and probably
 
01:06:51.789 --> 01:06:51.799 align:start position:0%
premature definitely premature but I in
 
01:06:53.870 --> 01:06:53.880 align:start position:0%
looking at the home cultivation of
 
01:06:55.789 --> 01:06:55.799 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis legislative history
 
01:06:59.710 --> 01:06:59.720 align:start position:0%
stream uh it has had you know some
 
01:07:01.870 --> 01:07:01.880 align:start position:0%
success on the legislative branch but it
 
01:07:03.910 --> 01:07:03.920 align:start position:0%
seems like every time it makes it to the
 
01:07:05.950 --> 01:07:05.960 align:start position:0%
Conor office it's been regardless of
 
01:07:10.549 --> 01:07:10.559 align:start position:0%
party not received well um given
 
01:07:13.390 --> 01:07:13.400 align:start position:0%
Governor aot's comments about cannabis
 
01:07:15.510 --> 01:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
and I I know she's mainly focused on
 
01:07:17.630 --> 01:07:17.640 align:start position:0%
recreational and her law enforcement
 
01:07:19.230 --> 01:07:19.240 align:start position:0%
background do you have any insight as to
 
01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
what she might do have there been any
 
01:07:22.750 --> 01:07:22.760 align:start position:0%
conversations with with her at all do
 
01:07:24.190 --> 01:07:24.200 align:start position:0%
you know I have not had any
 
01:07:26.390 --> 01:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
conversations however I remain an
 
01:07:30.309 --> 01:07:30.319 align:start position:0%
eternal optimist and I I I know that she
 
01:07:33.670 --> 01:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
has um telegraphed that she is against
 
01:07:37.910 --> 01:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
adult use just blanket against adult use
 
01:07:40.230 --> 01:07:40.240 align:start position:0%
once again this is not adult use this is
 
01:07:43.510 --> 01:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
therapeutic the majority of of uh people
 
01:07:48.349 --> 01:07:48.359 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire um uh support uh adult
 
01:07:52.990 --> 01:07:53.000 align:start position:0%
use and so I'm hoping that she might see
 
01:07:56.349 --> 01:07:56.359 align:start position:0%
a bill like this as a nod to the people
 
01:07:59.390 --> 01:07:59.400 align:start position:0%
who support cannabis but that it would
 
01:08:02.309 --> 01:08:02.319 align:start position:0%
help therapeutic patients and that is
 
01:08:05.670 --> 01:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
purely speculative sure now I understand
 
01:08:08.109 --> 01:08:08.119 align:start position:0%
um she hasn't been there that long and
 
01:08:10.390 --> 01:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
uh the bill isn't actually there yet
 
01:08:12.390 --> 01:08:12.400 align:start position:0%
again I my I'm
 
01:08:14.630 --> 01:08:14.640 align:start position:0%
only prompted to ask the question
 
01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
because I noticed Governor Lynch and
 
01:08:18.590 --> 01:08:18.600 align:start position:0%
Governor Hassen were loath to support it
 
01:08:20.910 --> 01:08:20.920 align:start position:0%
in fact weo did so which is one of the
 
01:08:22.789 --> 01:08:22.799 align:start position:0%
reasons I keep coming back and I keep
 
01:08:24.550 --> 01:08:24.560 align:start position:0%
putting bills for forward like this
 
01:08:26.630 --> 01:08:26.640 align:start position:0%
because there's so much misinformation
 
01:08:28.870 --> 01:08:28.880 align:start position:0%
about cannabis specifically therapeutic
 
01:08:30.430 --> 01:08:30.440 align:start position:0%
cannabis people think cannabis in
 
01:08:32.990 --> 01:08:33.000 align:start position:0%
general is bad bad bad it's a drug you
 
01:08:37.269 --> 01:08:37.279 align:start position:0%
know um uh it's got a it's got a history
 
01:08:40.189 --> 01:08:40.199 align:start position:0%
um of being portrayed as you know the
 
01:08:42.430 --> 01:08:42.440 align:start position:0%
devil's weed and that kind of stuff I
 
01:08:44.789 --> 01:08:44.799 align:start position:0%
keep coming forward and keep uh talking
 
01:08:46.550 --> 01:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
to people about therapeutic cannabis
 
01:08:50.829 --> 01:08:50.839 align:start position:0%
because it changes lives this is a uh a
 
01:08:52.990 --> 01:08:53.000 align:start position:0%
medication it's it's a true
 
01:08:56.189 --> 01:08:56.199 align:start position:0%
medication that when it is used
 
01:08:58.110 --> 01:08:58.120 align:start position:0%
therapeutically can make all the
 
01:09:00.990 --> 01:09:01.000 align:start position:0%
difference and um I I've said it in
 
01:09:03.229 --> 01:09:03.239 align:start position:0%
previous testimonies I'll repeat it now
 
01:09:05.269 --> 01:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
when I started the program I was on a
 
01:09:08.110 --> 01:09:08.120 align:start position:0%
pain contract with opioids and I was
 
01:09:11.829 --> 01:09:11.839 align:start position:0%
given 120 tablets a month to control my
 
01:09:14.910 --> 01:09:14.920 align:start position:0%
pain um everybody knows that that's not
 
01:09:17.470 --> 01:09:17.480 align:start position:0%
a good situation it's lifelong it
 
01:09:19.829 --> 01:09:19.839 align:start position:0%
doesn't change the symptoms it doesn't
 
01:09:21.950 --> 01:09:21.960 align:start position:0%
change the situation and you only get
 
01:09:23.510 --> 01:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
more used to it and then you require
 
01:09:25.590 --> 01:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
more and more and more when I started
 
01:09:28.749 --> 01:09:28.759 align:start position:0%
the program I stopped the opioids I
 
01:09:31.470 --> 01:09:31.480 align:start position:0%
simply didn't need them
 
01:09:35.749 --> 01:09:35.759 align:start position:0%
anymore so it's a Humane bill it's an
 
01:09:38.390 --> 01:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
economic bill it helps patients who
 
01:09:41.990 --> 01:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
can't afford their medication it's just
 
01:09:44.590 --> 01:09:44.600 align:start position:0%
something and if it doesn't pass I'll be
 
01:09:49.030 --> 01:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
back again promoting it okay thank you
 
01:09:50.669 --> 01:09:50.679 align:start position:0%
any other
 
01:09:52.749 --> 01:09:52.759 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
01:09:52.759 --> 01:09:57.990 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
much

01:09:57.990 --> 01:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:00.669 --> 01:10:00.679 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is former
 
01:10:07.070 --> 01:10:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:10.550 --> 01:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
kerk thank you very much Mr chair and uh
 
01:10:12.189 --> 01:10:12.199 align:start position:0%
the testimony I passed around in that
 
01:10:13.550 --> 01:10:13.560 align:start position:0%
little packet of things you have on your
 
01:10:15.750 --> 01:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
desk from earlier for the record Jerry
 
01:10:18.149 --> 01:10:18.159 align:start position:0%
nerk uh I'm the chair of the therapeutic
 
01:10:20.590 --> 01:10:20.600 align:start position:0%
cannabis medical oversight board and
 
01:10:22.550 --> 01:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
I've already told you what it is I do
 
01:10:24.390 --> 01:10:24.400 align:start position:0%
want to actually Echo something that has
 
01:10:27.110 --> 01:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
been said uh just a moment ago if we
 
01:10:28.669 --> 01:10:28.679 align:start position:0%
look at our most recent annual data
 
01:10:32.750 --> 01:10:32.760 align:start position:0%
report 72% of our patients are certified
 
01:10:36.590 --> 01:10:36.600 align:start position:0%
for pain that's really the one the some
 
01:10:38.550 --> 01:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
of the best data for its utility is in
 
01:10:40.950 --> 01:10:40.960 align:start position:0%
the treatment of pain and that's where
 
01:10:42.550 --> 01:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
uh we have the majority of our patients
 
01:10:45.550 --> 01:10:45.560 align:start position:0%
the great majority of Ages 50 to 60
 
01:10:47.149 --> 01:10:47.159 align:start position:0%
looking around the average their meeting
 
01:10:48.750 --> 01:10:48.760 align:start position:0%
age in this group you know that as you
 
01:10:50.149 --> 01:10:50.159 align:start position:0%
get a little older a lot of things hurt
 
01:10:51.709 --> 01:10:51.719 align:start position:0%
and some of them you know you just do
 
01:10:53.110 --> 01:10:53.120 align:start position:0%
norm and they go away but some things
 
01:10:55.070 --> 01:10:55.080 align:start position:0%
become really quite troubling for your
 
01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:56.149 align:start position:0%
become really quite troubling for your
life

01:10:56.149 --> 01:10:56.159 align:start position:0%
life
 
01:10:58.550 --> 01:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
and um I'd like to Echo also what
 
01:11:00.750 --> 01:11:00.760 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas said a lot of
 
01:11:02.550 --> 01:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
patients are able to diminish the
 
01:11:04.510 --> 01:11:04.520 align:start position:0%
medications they take often particularly
 
01:11:07.229 --> 01:11:07.239 align:start position:0%
been able to avoid opioids entirely and
 
01:11:08.550 --> 01:11:08.560 align:start position:0%
that's really quite beneficial because
 
01:11:09.709 --> 01:11:09.719 align:start position:0%
they don't have the exposure and
 
01:11:12.229 --> 01:11:12.239 align:start position:0%
therefore the risk for opioid disuse
 
01:11:16.229 --> 01:11:16.239 align:start position:0%
disorder tcob does support this bill
 
01:11:17.630 --> 01:11:17.640 align:start position:0%
it's the same as some bills in the past
 
01:11:19.470 --> 01:11:19.480 align:start position:0%
has been pointed out and we support it
 
01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
because it allow home cultivation by
 
01:11:22.590 --> 01:11:22.600 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis patients and
 
01:11:24.390 --> 01:11:24.400 align:start position:0%
designated caregivers to help them with
 
01:11:26.430 --> 01:11:26.440 align:start position:0%
affordability accessibility and
 
01:11:28.790 --> 01:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
availability of specific strains just to
 
01:11:31.110 --> 01:11:31.120 align:start position:0%
clarify too caregivers in this state
 
01:11:33.510 --> 01:11:33.520 align:start position:0%
mean somebody who basically handles the
 
01:11:34.830 --> 01:11:34.840 align:start position:0%
cannabis for somebody let's say you're
 
01:11:36.950 --> 01:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
80 years old uh you don't drive your
 
01:11:39.229 --> 01:11:39.239 align:start position:0%
eyes are bad and your closest uh
 
01:11:41.629 --> 01:11:41.639 align:start position:0%
dispensary is an hour away well somebody
 
01:11:43.430 --> 01:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
can go pick that up for you and bring it
 
01:11:44.910 --> 01:11:44.920 align:start position:0%
back and the reason we have they're your
 
01:11:46.709 --> 01:11:46.719 align:start position:0%
caregiver they're designated therefore
 
01:11:48.350 --> 01:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
they will not be charged with possession
 
01:11:51.430 --> 01:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
when they're doing that U on your behalf
 
01:11:53.070 --> 01:11:53.080 align:start position:0%
uh they're not this is not a setting
 
01:11:54.870 --> 01:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
where we have caregivers growing for
 
01:11:56.870 --> 01:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
other people people and this is uh not
 
01:11:58.470 --> 01:11:58.480 align:start position:0%
the point of this bill but our
 
01:12:01.310 --> 01:12:01.320 align:start position:0%
caregivers just help patients obtain it
 
01:12:03.669 --> 01:12:03.679 align:start position:0%
in any case um we had a listening
 
01:12:05.390 --> 01:12:05.400 align:start position:0%
session about three years ago with our
 
01:12:07.830 --> 01:12:07.840 align:start position:0%
patients and uh we got a lot of feedback
 
01:12:10.350 --> 01:12:10.360 align:start position:0%
and the most common concerns were the
 
01:12:12.229 --> 01:12:12.239 align:start position:0%
affordability of the products the
 
01:12:14.350 --> 01:12:14.360 align:start position:0%
accessibility of the atcs and the
 
01:12:16.110 --> 01:12:16.120 align:start position:0%
availability of specific
 
01:12:18.149 --> 01:12:18.159 align:start position:0%
strains uh which may not be available
 
01:12:20.350 --> 01:12:20.360 align:start position:0%
from their nearest ATC the specific
 
01:12:21.629 --> 01:12:21.639 align:start position:0%
strain they might need to treat their
 
01:12:23.629 --> 01:12:23.639 align:start position:0%
symptoms because as been pointed out
 
01:12:25.310 --> 01:12:25.320 align:start position:0%
different strains have different effects
 
01:12:27.910 --> 01:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
for different people and so that really
 
01:12:29.550 --> 01:12:29.560 align:start position:0%
matters for treating their particular
 
01:12:31.870 --> 01:12:31.880 align:start position:0%
illness so many patients thought that
 
01:12:33.790 --> 01:12:33.800 align:start position:0%
home cultivation would help to solve
 
01:12:35.910 --> 01:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
this again as was mentioned a lot of
 
01:12:38.390 --> 01:12:38.400 align:start position:0%
people aren't going to do this um I'm a
 
01:12:40.110 --> 01:12:40.120 align:start position:0%
big Gardener I have a big Greenhouse all
 
01:12:41.830 --> 01:12:41.840 align:start position:0%
kinds of stuff but you know a lot of
 
01:12:43.030 --> 01:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
people don't want to invest that kind of
 
01:12:44.510 --> 01:12:44.520 align:start position:0%
time or they're in an apartment or they
 
01:12:45.590 --> 01:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
they just don't have a place where they
 
01:12:47.510 --> 01:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
could actually even grow it so this is
 
01:12:49.070 --> 01:12:49.080 align:start position:0%
not going to be a lot of people but
 
01:12:51.270 --> 01:12:51.280 align:start position:0%
they'll be some that might do it um at
 
01:12:53.709 --> 01:12:53.719 align:start position:0%
the January 2023 meeting we reviewed the
 
01:12:56.229 --> 01:12:56.239 align:start position:0%
initial bill of HB 431 and voted
 
01:12:57.750 --> 01:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
unanimously to agree with it and we've
 
01:12:59.830 --> 01:12:59.840 align:start position:0%
renewed our approval with each of these
 
01:13:02.310 --> 01:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
subsequent bills again uh there were
 
01:13:05.510 --> 01:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
some uh concerns in the past about you
 
01:13:07.470 --> 01:13:07.480 align:start position:0%
know the the diminished knowledge about
 
01:13:10.470 --> 01:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
canabo content to the home cultivation
 
01:13:13.270 --> 01:13:13.280 align:start position:0%
uh cultiv ours and well that is true
 
01:13:15.990 --> 01:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
again the uh they can't guarantee
 
01:13:17.709 --> 01:13:17.719 align:start position:0%
exactly how it's going to grow but that
 
01:13:20.470 --> 01:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
gives you a good chance for that uh I do
 
01:13:22.189 --> 01:13:22.199 align:start position:0%
want to make one point up toight I've
 
01:13:24.830 --> 01:13:24.840 align:start position:0%
spoken about what the TCM o stands for
 
01:13:27.550 --> 01:13:27.560 align:start position:0%
as a group I'd like to speak for myself
 
01:13:29.870 --> 01:13:29.880 align:start position:0%
just with one thing we did not go into
 
01:13:34.669 --> 01:13:34.679 align:start position:0%
all of the weeds of this bill um because
 
01:13:36.229 --> 01:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
we didn't want to worry about all that
 
01:13:38.790 --> 01:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
detail we just support the concept but I
 
01:13:40.390 --> 01:13:40.400 align:start position:0%
want to point out that there are robust
 
01:13:42.149 --> 01:13:42.159 align:start position:0%
protections with respect to limitations
 
01:13:44.430 --> 01:13:44.440 align:start position:0%
in the number of plants uh the
 
01:13:46.229 --> 01:13:46.239 align:start position:0%
registration of cultivation sites that
 
01:13:48.350 --> 01:13:48.360 align:start position:0%
have to be enclosed and locked and these
 
01:13:50.830 --> 01:13:50.840 align:start position:0%
should make it safe secure and
 
01:13:53.390 --> 01:13:53.400 align:start position:0%
controlled and satisfy the concerns of
 
01:13:56.870 --> 01:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
law enforcement so we urge you to pass
 
01:14:00.550 --> 01:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
hp53 to allow home cultivation to help
 
01:14:02.430 --> 01:14:02.440 align:start position:0%
patients with affordability
 
01:14:04.270 --> 01:14:04.280 align:start position:0%
accessibility and availability of
 
01:14:06.390 --> 01:14:06.400 align:start position:0%
specific strains and I'd be glad to take
 
01:14:07.870 --> 01:14:07.880 align:start position:0%
questions as well thank you
 
01:14:10.510 --> 01:14:10.520 align:start position:0%
representative Nel thank you Mr chairman
 
01:14:12.229 --> 01:14:12.239 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question and I
 
01:14:13.550 --> 01:14:13.560 align:start position:0%
think you already know the question I'm
 
01:14:16.390 --> 01:14:16.400 align:start position:0%
going to ask but I don't remember you
 
01:14:18.270 --> 01:14:18.280 align:start position:0%
will so
 
01:14:21.470 --> 01:14:21.480 align:start position:0%
um you know I I support everything
 
01:14:24.229 --> 01:14:24.239 align:start position:0%
you've said up to a point um I think
 
01:14:26.629 --> 01:14:26.639 align:start position:0%
I've certified probably as many patients
 
01:14:29.229 --> 01:14:29.239 align:start position:0%
for therapeutic cannabis as as
 
01:14:33.030 --> 01:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
anybody um with that said I'm not aware
 
01:14:34.950 --> 01:14:34.960 align:start position:0%
of any pharmaceutical that we allow
 
01:14:37.910 --> 01:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
people to produce at home because of
 
01:14:40.229 --> 01:14:40.239 align:start position:0%
reproducibility concerns risk benefit
 
01:14:43.750 --> 01:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
ratios things like that um I appreciate
 
01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:44.750 align:start position:0%
ratios things like that um I appreciate
the

01:14:44.750 --> 01:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:14:48.189 --> 01:14:48.199 align:start position:0%
um the Protections in this bill and all
 
01:14:50.550 --> 01:14:50.560 align:start position:0%
that but the reason why I don't support
 
01:14:53.669 --> 01:14:53.679 align:start position:0%
it is because I just don't think you can
 
01:14:55.950 --> 01:14:55.960 align:start position:0%
make a reproducible product at
 
01:14:58.310 --> 01:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
home tell me can is there any way you
 
01:14:59.629 --> 01:14:59.639 align:start position:0%
can tell me why I'm
 
01:15:03.189 --> 01:15:03.199 align:start position:0%
wrong no uh but in essence though to
 
01:15:04.390 --> 01:15:04.400 align:start position:0%
remember there's a couple of things
 
01:15:06.950 --> 01:15:06.960 align:start position:0%
about it you're right it will not be uh
 
01:15:08.550 --> 01:15:08.560 align:start position:0%
well actually let's back up a bit when
 
01:15:10.629 --> 01:15:10.639 align:start position:0%
you get a generic medication remember
 
01:15:13.629 --> 01:15:13.639 align:start position:0%
the the range for what has to be in that
 
01:15:15.470 --> 01:15:15.480 align:start position:0%
is plus or minus 20 which means you
 
01:15:17.550 --> 01:15:17.560 align:start position:0%
might get one batch one time and the
 
01:15:20.189 --> 01:15:20.199 align:start position:0%
next batch May that only has 80% of what
 
01:15:21.310 --> 01:15:21.320 align:start position:0%
it's supposed to have and the next one
 
01:15:23.590 --> 01:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
could be 120% so that's not entirely
 
01:15:25.790 --> 01:15:25.800 align:start position:0%
reproducible when you go by your you
 
01:15:27.629 --> 01:15:27.639 align:start position:0%
know your over the-counter not over
 
01:15:29.390 --> 01:15:29.400 align:start position:0%
counter your generic
 
01:15:31.950 --> 01:15:31.960 align:start position:0%
theil so there's a lot of variability
 
01:15:35.350 --> 01:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
there anyway but also with cannabis
 
01:15:38.830 --> 01:15:38.840 align:start position:0%
there is no one set dose a person uh
 
01:15:42.229 --> 01:15:42.239 align:start position:0%
doses the rule uses start low go slow
 
01:15:44.189 --> 01:15:44.199 align:start position:0%
and gradually increase if they have a
 
01:15:46.590 --> 01:15:46.600 align:start position:0%
new batch they would probably do the
 
01:15:47.990 --> 01:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
same thing they would start with a very
 
01:15:49.350 --> 01:15:49.360 align:start position:0%
small thing and say well that's not
 
01:15:50.990 --> 01:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
giving me the effect I need and tweak it
 
01:15:53.669 --> 01:15:53.679 align:start position:0%
up a little bit more till they get the
 
01:15:56.110 --> 01:15:56.120 align:start position:0%
may say pain relief that they desire but
 
01:15:58.870 --> 01:15:58.880 align:start position:0%
without too much sedation or Euphoria so
 
01:16:01.149 --> 01:16:01.159 align:start position:0%
they given the dosing that we do which
 
01:16:03.950 --> 01:16:03.960 align:start position:0%
is a little bit more individualized than
 
01:16:05.590 --> 01:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
what we do when we're treating your
 
01:16:08.070 --> 01:16:08.080 align:start position:0%
hypertension or something like that not
 
01:16:11.750 --> 01:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
as much of a problem um lastly again is
 
01:16:15.270 --> 01:16:15.280 align:start position:0%
that you you know a person can if they
 
01:16:16.950 --> 01:16:16.960 align:start position:0%
really are quite sensitive or they're
 
01:16:18.110 --> 01:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
trying a new batch and they're not
 
01:16:19.550 --> 01:16:19.560 align:start position:0%
getting what they want they can submit
 
01:16:21.510 --> 01:16:21.520 align:start position:0%
it for testing and find out precisely
 
01:16:24.709 --> 01:16:24.719 align:start position:0%
what that cannaboid content is um it's
 
01:16:27.030 --> 01:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
not not an exact science I would agree
 
01:16:28.430 --> 01:16:28.440 align:start position:0%
but I would again point out that if we
 
01:16:29.990 --> 01:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
get generic drugs they're not exact
 
01:16:33.430 --> 01:16:33.440 align:start position:0%
either so
 
01:16:35.310 --> 01:16:35.320 align:start position:0%
yeah other
 
01:16:38.430 --> 01:16:38.440 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
01:16:41.870 --> 01:16:41.880 align:start position:0%
delus thank you Mr
 
01:16:45.470 --> 01:16:45.480 align:start position:0%
chair representative um I'm forward
 
01:16:48.910 --> 01:16:48.920 align:start position:0%
curious to know who who goes and checks
 
01:16:52.470 --> 01:16:52.480 align:start position:0%
on the number of plants is it state is
 
01:16:55.189 --> 01:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
it the providers
 
01:16:56.950 --> 01:16:56.960 align:start position:0%
how how are these where are the checks
 
01:16:59.590 --> 01:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
and balances that the physical you know
 
01:17:01.110 --> 01:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
knock on the door go to someone's house
 
01:17:03.790 --> 01:17:03.800 align:start position:0%
and say oh you've got five plants
 
01:17:05.750 --> 01:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
there's in the bill I do not remember
 
01:17:08.550 --> 01:17:08.560 align:start position:0%
that there was any kind of uh inspection
 
01:17:11.270 --> 01:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
program at all but in the bill it is
 
01:17:15.110 --> 01:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
also noted that if for example uh law
 
01:17:17.470 --> 01:17:17.480 align:start position:0%
enforcement has questions or concerns
 
01:17:18.990 --> 01:17:19.000 align:start position:0%
they can't just go knock on the door but
 
01:17:21.430 --> 01:17:21.440 align:start position:0%
they can submit an affidavit uh to
 
01:17:23.110 --> 01:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
confirm whether there is growth at that
 
01:17:24.510 --> 01:17:24.520 align:start position:0%
place or whether that person is allowed
 
01:17:25.750 --> 01:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
to grow
 
01:17:28.149 --> 01:17:28.159 align:start position:0%
um and I think then once they've got the
 
01:17:30.550 --> 01:17:30.560 align:start position:0%
affidavit and a search warrant they can
 
01:17:32.950 --> 01:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
go and check so there that can be
 
01:17:34.510 --> 01:17:34.520 align:start position:0%
checked if there's a suspicion that
 
01:17:36.830 --> 01:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
somebody is growing a lot producing it
 
01:17:39.070 --> 01:17:39.080 align:start position:0%
and they're selling it somewhere uh law
 
01:17:41.030 --> 01:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement can follow up on
 
01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:43.189 align:start position:0%
enforcement can follow up on
that

01:17:43.189 --> 01:17:43.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:17:44.990 --> 01:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
followup thank
 
01:17:47.990 --> 01:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
you so is there any should we be
 
01:17:51.550 --> 01:17:51.560 align:start position:0%
concerned about an FN on this I mean is
 
01:17:53.990 --> 01:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
it just so slight that we wouldn't worry
 
01:17:55.750 --> 01:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
about financial
 
01:17:57.950 --> 01:17:57.960 align:start position:0%
burden for yeah since there's nothing in
 
01:18:00.430 --> 01:18:00.440 align:start position:0%
the law that requires the
 
01:18:03.629 --> 01:18:03.639 align:start position:0%
ATC sorry requires the program to go do
 
01:18:05.750 --> 01:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
an inspection that that cost to be
 
01:18:09.629 --> 01:18:09.639 align:start position:0%
minimal the the patient does have to uh
 
01:18:11.830 --> 01:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
submit uh register that they're going to
 
01:18:14.189 --> 01:18:14.199 align:start position:0%
be having a cultivation but that's a
 
01:18:16.510 --> 01:18:16.520 align:start position:0%
pretty trivial uh
 
01:18:19.510 --> 01:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
addition again we don't expect all that
 
01:18:22.189 --> 01:18:22.199 align:start position:0%
many people are going to do it I mean a
 
01:18:23.430 --> 01:18:23.440 align:start position:0%
lot of people are a lot happier to go
 
01:18:24.990 --> 01:18:25.000 align:start position:0%
there buy their Tomatoes at the farm
 
01:18:25.950 --> 01:18:25.960 align:start position:0%
Market than to go through all the
 
01:18:28.270 --> 01:18:28.280 align:start position:0%
trouble of growing their
 
01:18:31.310 --> 01:18:31.320 align:start position:0%
Tomatoes other
 
01:18:38.310 --> 01:18:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:40.910 --> 01:18:40.920 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Michael
 
01:18:42.229 --> 01:18:42.239 align:start position:0%
Holt from the New Hampshire Department
 
01:18:44.470 --> 01:18:44.480 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services you've
 
01:18:46.189 --> 01:18:46.199 align:start position:0%
asked for four minutes three would be
 
01:18:49.870 --> 01:18:49.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:52.270 --> 01:18:52.280 align:start position:0%
it thank you Mr chair members of the
 
01:18:55.750 --> 01:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
committee um I will be brief um happy to
 
01:18:56.910 --> 01:18:56.920 align:start position:0%
answer some of the questions that went
 
01:18:58.990 --> 01:18:59.000 align:start position:0%
around the table that were um couldn't
 
01:19:00.550 --> 01:19:00.560 align:start position:0%
be answered earlier as well for the
 
01:19:01.990 --> 01:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
record my name is Michael Holt I'm the
 
01:19:03.229 --> 01:19:03.239 align:start position:0%
administrator of the therapeutic
 
01:19:04.709 --> 01:19:04.719 align:start position:0%
cannabis program with the Department of
 
01:19:07.590 --> 01:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services um House Bill
 
01:19:10.870 --> 01:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
53 the department takes no position on
 
01:19:14.550 --> 01:19:14.560 align:start position:0%
but I do want to be here um to um to
 
01:19:16.470 --> 01:19:16.480 align:start position:0%
establish that we agree that this bill
 
01:19:18.229 --> 01:19:18.239 align:start position:0%
will result in benefits to patients due
 
01:19:20.590 --> 01:19:20.600 align:start position:0%
to increased access increase strain
 
01:19:24.470 --> 01:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
availability and lower costs um and I
 
01:19:25.709 --> 01:19:25.719 align:start position:0%
want to highlight some of the uh
 
01:19:28.310 --> 01:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
safeguards and guard rails um uh that
 
01:19:30.510 --> 01:19:30.520 align:start position:0%
are included in this bill the expressed
 
01:19:32.470 --> 01:19:32.480 align:start position:0%
concerns about home cultivation are
 
01:19:34.270 --> 01:19:34.280 align:start position:0%
usually focused on the increased
 
01:19:36.629 --> 01:19:36.639 align:start position:0%
potential for diversion um considering
 
01:19:38.830 --> 01:19:38.840 align:start position:0%
the regional access to cannabis by
 
01:19:40.950 --> 01:19:40.960 align:start position:0%
adults here in New Hampshire we're
 
01:19:43.390 --> 01:19:43.400 align:start position:0%
surrounded by legal states uh the lower
 
01:19:45.310 --> 01:19:45.320 align:start position:0%
prices of recreational cannabis in other
 
01:19:46.590 --> 01:19:46.600 align:start position:0%
states as compared to New Hampshire
 
01:19:48.510 --> 01:19:48.520 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis and the extra
 
01:19:50.790 --> 01:19:50.800 align:start position:0%
penalties for patients who divert the
 
01:19:52.629 --> 01:19:52.639 align:start position:0%
risk of diversion has greatly diminished
 
01:19:55.430 --> 01:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
since this law passed in 2013
 
01:19:58.110 --> 01:19:58.120 align:start position:0%
um some of the safeguards included in
 
01:20:00.229 --> 01:20:00.239 align:start position:0%
this bill include it allows only a very
 
01:20:02.430 --> 01:20:02.440 align:start position:0%
small number of plants Three Mature
 
01:20:02.440 --> 01:20:03.470 align:start position:0%
small number of plants Three Mature
three

01:20:03.470 --> 01:20:03.480 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:20:05.870 --> 01:20:05.880 align:start position:0%
immature either the patient or the
 
01:20:08.870 --> 01:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
caregiver can cultivate not
 
01:20:11.709 --> 01:20:11.719 align:start position:0%
both if a caregiver cultivates the
 
01:20:14.590 --> 01:20:14.600 align:start position:0%
caregiver can only have one patient not
 
01:20:16.669 --> 01:20:16.679 align:start position:0%
the allowed five uh if they're if
 
01:20:19.149 --> 01:20:19.159 align:start position:0%
they're not cultivating the cultivation
 
01:20:22.390 --> 01:20:22.400 align:start position:0%
location must be at the person's
 
01:20:25.070 --> 01:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
residence the cultivation location must
 
01:20:27.189 --> 01:20:27.199 align:start position:0%
be reported to and registered with the
 
01:20:29.470 --> 01:20:29.480 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program including
 
01:20:32.510 --> 01:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
any changes to cultivation location the
 
01:20:34.910 --> 01:20:34.920 align:start position:0%
location must be out of public view in a
 
01:20:37.709 --> 01:20:37.719 align:start position:0%
locked and enclosed space with a size
 
01:20:41.510 --> 01:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
limitation a landlord can prohibit home
 
01:20:43.470 --> 01:20:43.480 align:start position:0%
cultivation representative Mazer if
 
01:20:46.030 --> 01:20:46.040 align:start position:0%
there's concerns about odor um the
 
01:20:47.790 --> 01:20:47.800 align:start position:0%
department is authorized to share the
 
01:20:50.030 --> 01:20:50.040 align:start position:0%
registered cultivation location with
 
01:20:52.110 --> 01:20:52.120 align:start position:0%
local and state law enforcement upon
 
01:20:53.750 --> 01:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
receipt of a sworn affidavit that's a
 
01:20:56.189 --> 01:20:56.199 align:start position:0%
lesser standard than a court
 
01:20:59.669 --> 01:20:59.679 align:start position:0%
order um atcs are allowed by this bill
 
01:21:01.870 --> 01:21:01.880 align:start position:0%
to sell seeds and seedlings to patients
 
01:21:03.709 --> 01:21:03.719 align:start position:0%
they'll be expected to provide education
 
01:21:05.189 --> 01:21:05.199 align:start position:0%
to patients on
 
01:21:07.270 --> 01:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
cultivation uh the LI there are limits
 
01:21:08.830 --> 01:21:08.840 align:start position:0%
about the number of uh seedlings that
 
01:21:10.990 --> 01:21:11.000 align:start position:0%
can be sold which align with the maximum
 
01:21:12.590 --> 01:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
number of plants and seedlings elsewhere
 
01:21:13.390 --> 01:21:13.400 align:start position:0%
in the
 
01:21:16.270 --> 01:21:16.280 align:start position:0%
law the one independent Testing Lab in
 
01:21:19.149 --> 01:21:19.159 align:start position:0%
the state is permitted by this bill to
 
01:21:20.830 --> 01:21:20.840 align:start position:0%
test samples from patients and
 
01:21:22.470 --> 01:21:22.480 align:start position:0%
caregivers who grow their own this is
 
01:21:24.990 --> 01:21:25.000 align:start position:0%
not required um but the this has
 
01:21:26.750 --> 01:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
indicated their willingness uh and
 
01:21:28.189 --> 01:21:28.199 align:start position:0%
interest in doing
 
01:21:30.350 --> 01:21:30.360 align:start position:0%
so um and the department has the
 
01:21:32.669 --> 01:21:32.679 align:start position:0%
authority to revoke a patient or
 
01:21:34.669 --> 01:21:34.679 align:start position:0%
caregivers cultivation privilege for any
 
01:21:38.470 --> 01:21:38.480 align:start position:0%
violation of law or rule um so to
 
01:21:39.669 --> 01:21:39.679 align:start position:0%
summarize the department can
 
01:21:41.590 --> 01:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
operationalize this legislation without
 
01:21:44.750 --> 01:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
issue without fiscal impact um I'm happy
 
01:21:46.629 --> 01:21:46.639 align:start position:0%
to take more questions but I'm happy to
 
01:21:47.590 --> 01:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
answer some of the questions that were
 
01:21:49.830 --> 01:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
already asked um we talked about
 
01:21:52.270 --> 01:21:52.280 align:start position:0%
prevention of diversion um and that it's
 
01:21:54.830 --> 01:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
it's it's not as nearly a risk as it was
 
01:21:57.750 --> 01:21:57.760 align:start position:0%
in 2013 when the uh uh the law first
 
01:22:01.590 --> 01:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
passed talked about odor
 
01:22:04.350 --> 01:22:04.360 align:start position:0%
um there is we uh we have a state
 
01:22:06.750 --> 01:22:06.760 align:start position:0%
registry representative um maer but it
 
01:22:08.189 --> 01:22:08.199 align:start position:0%
is a confidential registry it's a
 
01:22:10.430 --> 01:22:10.440 align:start position:0%
medical program state and local law
 
01:22:12.709 --> 01:22:12.719 align:start position:0%
enforcement do have special access to it
 
01:22:15.030 --> 01:22:15.040 align:start position:0%
to verify the validity of a card but
 
01:22:16.510 --> 01:22:16.520 align:start position:0%
they must meet certain thresholds they
 
01:22:17.870 --> 01:22:17.880 align:start position:0%
don't have direct access through their
 
01:22:20.669 --> 01:22:20.679 align:start position:0%
Cruisers say um and we we feel those
 
01:22:25.430 --> 01:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
calls on a regular basis um
 
01:22:26.629 --> 01:22:26.639 align:start position:0%
the uh your question representative
 
01:22:28.990 --> 01:22:29.000 align:start position:0%
Lucas about the uh the the is there is
 
01:22:30.709 --> 01:22:30.719 align:start position:0%
there an excess cannabis produced at the
 
01:22:34.149 --> 01:22:34.159 align:start position:0%
atcs um that section of law is uh is
 
01:22:37.350 --> 01:22:37.360 align:start position:0%
being changed to align the terms mature
 
01:22:39.669 --> 01:22:39.679 align:start position:0%
and immature um it is not changing the
 
01:22:42.550 --> 01:22:42.560 align:start position:0%
amounts of cannabis being uh Allowed by
 
01:22:45.510 --> 01:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
the atcs um but to answer your question
 
01:22:48.470 --> 01:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
uh there's no market for cannabis to be
 
01:22:50.830 --> 01:22:50.840 align:start position:0%
sold besides patients so there's no
 
01:22:53.510 --> 01:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
incentive for the atcs to produce more
 
01:22:56.350 --> 01:22:56.360 align:start position:0%
than what they can sell to patients um
 
01:22:58.790 --> 01:22:58.800 align:start position:0%
the uh the caps in law have never been
 
01:23:01.709 --> 01:23:01.719 align:start position:0%
exceeded not even close um in terms of
 
01:23:03.910 --> 01:23:03.920 align:start position:0%
uh the the atc's current inventory we
 
01:23:05.750 --> 01:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
require the atcs to have very strict
 
01:23:07.430 --> 01:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
inventory controls including a seed to
 
01:23:10.709 --> 01:23:10.719 align:start position:0%
sell software which uh which um tracks
 
01:23:15.030 --> 01:23:15.040 align:start position:0%
all plants um all products Etc um and to
 
01:23:17.669 --> 01:23:17.679 align:start position:0%
the question of who enforces the the it
 
01:23:20.910 --> 01:23:20.920 align:start position:0%
uh the answer is is it is self enforced
 
01:23:23.510 --> 01:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
um the penalties of being caught
 
01:23:25.590 --> 01:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
producing more and losing your card are
 
01:23:29.189 --> 01:23:29.199 align:start position:0%
are serious for a patient um and so uh
 
01:23:30.950 --> 01:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
this bill does not contain any
 
01:23:33.470 --> 01:23:33.480 align:start position:0%
provisions where law enforcement or the
 
01:23:36.390 --> 01:23:36.400 align:start position:0%
state uh can access people's homes um
 
01:23:37.629 --> 01:23:37.639 align:start position:0%
however as I mentioned there are
 
01:23:40.070 --> 01:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
Provisions where we can uh relay that
 
01:23:41.990 --> 01:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
information of a cultivate cultivation
 
01:23:45.510 --> 01:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
location to local and state law
 
01:23:48.790 --> 01:23:48.800 align:start position:0%
enforcement thank you for going over um
 
01:23:50.270 --> 01:23:50.280 align:start position:0%
you've answer several questions that
 
01:23:51.990 --> 01:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
people had and are there any other
 
01:23:54.430 --> 01:23:54.440 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee You' been
 
01:23:56.430 --> 01:23:56.440 align:start position:0%
very very compreh oh representative
 
01:23:59.910 --> 01:23:59.920 align:start position:0%
McKay thank you Mr
 
01:24:03.270 --> 01:24:03.280 align:start position:0%
chairman one of the obvious things is
 
01:24:06.990 --> 01:24:07.000 align:start position:0%
the distinction between recreational use
 
01:24:12.430 --> 01:24:12.440 align:start position:0%
of marijuana and and medical
 
01:24:17.189 --> 01:24:17.199 align:start position:0%
marijuana uh I think the general public
 
01:24:19.750 --> 01:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
thinks of marijuana as
 
01:24:23.709 --> 01:24:23.719 align:start position:0%
marijuana and that is the department
 
01:24:27.310 --> 01:24:27.320 align:start position:0%
considering bring anything about
 
01:24:30.110 --> 01:24:30.120 align:start position:0%
public um
 
01:24:33.709 --> 01:24:33.719 align:start position:0%
information that would emphasize the
 
01:24:36.189 --> 01:24:36.199 align:start position:0%
therapeutic use of
 
01:24:38.550 --> 01:24:38.560 align:start position:0%
marijuana because
 
01:24:41.910 --> 01:24:41.920 align:start position:0%
the the concern in the legislature I
 
01:24:46.470 --> 01:24:46.480 align:start position:0%
think is the use of marijuana illegally
 
01:24:46.480 --> 01:24:48.310 align:start position:0%
think is the use of marijuana illegally
and

01:24:48.310 --> 01:24:48.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:24:51.950 --> 01:24:51.960 align:start position:0%
inappropriately and not so much the
 
01:24:55.669 --> 01:24:55.679 align:start position:0%
support of that very important
 
01:25:01.590 --> 01:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
uh therapeutic use of marijuana so it is
 
01:25:04.830 --> 01:25:04.840 align:start position:0%
the department I know you're a onean
 
01:25:08.790 --> 01:25:08.800 align:start position:0%
show uh but that is the department in a
 
01:25:13.669 --> 01:25:13.679 align:start position:0%
position to publicize some of that major
 
01:25:18.629 --> 01:25:18.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:20.550 --> 01:25:20.560 align:start position:0%
legislature um thank you for the
 
01:25:21.950 --> 01:25:21.960 align:start position:0%
question representative McKay it's a
 
01:25:24.950 --> 01:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
difficult one um the department uh
 
01:25:27.229 --> 01:25:27.239 align:start position:0%
was given this program in 20133 as an
 
01:25:30.030 --> 01:25:30.040 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandate no State funds no
 
01:25:31.470 --> 01:25:31.480 align:start position:0%
general fund dollars go to support the
 
01:25:34.189 --> 01:25:34.199 align:start position:0%
program it's entirely self-funded um it
 
01:25:37.030 --> 01:25:37.040 align:start position:0%
is uh for for some a controversial
 
01:25:39.950 --> 01:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
program um we have in our department a
 
01:25:41.590 --> 01:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
bureau of drug and alcohol Services
 
01:25:43.790 --> 01:25:43.800 align:start position:0%
which is focused on uh prevention uh
 
01:25:46.830 --> 01:25:46.840 align:start position:0%
Services as well so there is uh some um
 
01:25:48.590 --> 01:25:48.600 align:start position:0%
this complexity there in terms of
 
01:25:50.790 --> 01:25:50.800 align:start position:0%
messaging um historically over the past
 
01:25:53.590 --> 01:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
10 years the department has not
 
01:25:53.600 --> 01:25:54.870 align:start position:0%
10 years the department has not
publicized

01:25:54.870 --> 01:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
publicized
 
01:25:57.910 --> 01:25:57.920 align:start position:0%
or advertised this program obviously we
 
01:26:00.189 --> 01:26:00.199 align:start position:0%
do have a website you know that um talks
 
01:26:01.709 --> 01:26:01.719 align:start position:0%
about our therapeutic cannabis program
 
01:26:04.550 --> 01:26:04.560 align:start position:0%
Services we have done a number of press
 
01:26:07.350 --> 01:26:07.360 align:start position:0%
releases um when the uh when the
 
01:26:09.550 --> 01:26:09.560 align:start position:0%
situation calls for it like for instance
 
01:26:12.189 --> 01:26:12.199 align:start position:0%
when uh a new a new uh dispensary would
 
01:26:16.189 --> 01:26:16.199 align:start position:0%
open so there is some um public facing
 
01:26:17.709 --> 01:26:17.719 align:start position:0%
you know um activities that the
 
01:26:19.629 --> 01:26:19.639 align:start position:0%
department engages in but generally
 
01:26:23.510 --> 01:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
speaking um we don't engage in
 
01:26:28.590 --> 01:26:28.600 align:start position:0%
advertising program um we would
 
01:26:30.790 --> 01:26:30.800 align:start position:0%
prefer patients enrollment or
 
01:26:33.030 --> 01:26:33.040 align:start position:0%
registration with a program to be based
 
01:26:35.430 --> 01:26:35.440 align:start position:0%
on a conversation between a patient and
 
01:26:38.750 --> 01:26:38.760 align:start position:0%
their medical provider um and uh we
 
01:26:41.070 --> 01:26:41.080 align:start position:0%
would then provide all the information
 
01:26:43.189 --> 01:26:43.199 align:start position:0%
um that is appropriate you know to
 
01:26:45.430 --> 01:26:45.440 align:start position:0%
provide so I I appreciate the question
 
01:26:47.350 --> 01:26:47.360 align:start position:0%
um could we do more would I like to do
 
01:26:51.189 --> 01:26:51.199 align:start position:0%
more perhaps um but uh we're we're in a
 
01:26:53.310 --> 01:26:53.320 align:start position:0%
place where it's a program that serves
 
01:26:56.669 --> 01:26:56.679 align:start position:0%
patients um we educate providers um but
 
01:26:59.590 --> 01:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
we don't advertise the program
 
01:27:01.510 --> 01:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily I hope
 
01:27:04.430 --> 01:27:04.440 align:start position:0%
that answers your question
 
01:27:07.510 --> 01:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
somewhat other questions thank you very
 
01:27:16.070 --> 01:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:18.950 --> 01:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is The
 
01:27:18.960 --> 01:27:20.030 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is The
Honorable

01:27:20.030 --> 01:27:20.040 align:start position:0%
Honorable
 
01:27:27.350 --> 01:27:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:29.830 --> 01:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
thank you um if I could before I start
 
01:27:31.470 --> 01:27:31.480 align:start position:0%
sir to answer your question the reason
 
01:27:34.109 --> 01:27:34.119 align:start position:0%
that that there doesn't need to be more
 
01:27:36.669 --> 01:27:36.679 align:start position:0%
advertisement from the Cannabis the
 
01:27:38.709 --> 01:27:38.719 align:start position:0%
state's cannabis program is there is
 
01:27:42.950 --> 01:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
really a NeverEnding bench of PR
 
01:27:46.510 --> 01:27:46.520 align:start position:0%
marijuana advocating Lobby organizations
 
01:27:50.430 --> 01:27:50.440 align:start position:0%
that are doing Yan's work on that behalf
 
01:27:51.910 --> 01:27:51.920 align:start position:0%
um I just want to say uh Sam New
 
01:27:53.229 --> 01:27:53.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire opposes this bill it's
 
01:27:55.310 --> 01:27:55.320 align:start position:0%
well-meaning very well- meaning and I
 
01:27:57.550 --> 01:27:57.560 align:start position:0%
understand uh with regard to medical
 
01:27:59.990 --> 01:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
marijuana users who live far from atc's
 
01:28:01.510 --> 01:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
or who may struggle with the cost of
 
01:28:04.149 --> 01:28:04.159 align:start position:0%
purchasing product however it also
 
01:28:05.629 --> 01:28:05.639 align:start position:0%
represents a clear expansion of the
 
01:28:08.070 --> 01:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
medical marijuana program that has
 
01:28:09.990 --> 01:28:10.000 align:start position:0%
issues serious issues with enforcement
 
01:28:12.470 --> 01:28:12.480 align:start position:0%
and oversight we've all heard today that
 
01:28:14.790 --> 01:28:14.800 align:start position:0%
there is it's the honor System plain and
 
01:28:17.189 --> 01:28:17.199 align:start position:0%
simple was just the honor System uh
 
01:28:19.870 --> 01:28:19.880 align:start position:0%
currently the state's uh program
 
01:28:22.310 --> 01:28:22.320 align:start position:0%
office the Cannabis program office or
 
01:28:24.109 --> 01:28:24.119 align:start position:0%
even the department of AG agriculture
 
01:28:26.830 --> 01:28:26.840 align:start position:0%
culture have zero bandwidth to provide
 
01:28:30.229 --> 01:28:30.239 align:start position:0%
any kind of um oversight to this program
 
01:28:32.270 --> 01:28:32.280 align:start position:0%
they they don't they won't have the
 
01:28:33.550 --> 01:28:33.560 align:start position:0%
ability to enforce whether or not the
 
01:28:35.629 --> 01:28:35.639 align:start position:0%
marijuana grower is only producing
 
01:28:37.189 --> 01:28:37.199 align:start position:0%
medical marijuana for one of their
 
01:28:39.550 --> 01:28:39.560 align:start position:0%
potential five legal met medical
 
01:28:42.189 --> 01:28:42.199 align:start position:0%
marijuana patients they will not be able
 
01:28:43.629 --> 01:28:43.639 align:start position:0%
to ensure that they're producing more
 
01:28:45.830 --> 01:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
than eight ounces of usable marijuana or
 
01:28:47.350 --> 01:28:47.360 align:start position:0%
to ensure that they're not making more
 
01:28:50.830 --> 01:28:50.840 align:start position:0%
than $500 in annual sales in addition it
 
01:28:52.950 --> 01:28:52.960 align:start position:0%
also um does not include any language
 
01:28:54.990 --> 01:28:55.000 align:start position:0%
that would address non Financial in-kind
 
01:28:57.470 --> 01:28:57.480 align:start position:0%
barter payments which would allow for
 
01:28:58.870 --> 01:28:58.880 align:start position:0%
some potential
 
01:29:01.310 --> 01:29:01.320 align:start position:0%
malfeasance uh with the law in addition
 
01:29:02.830 --> 01:29:02.840 align:start position:0%
the bill clarifies that the names of the
 
01:29:04.629 --> 01:29:04.639 align:start position:0%
individuals enrolled in the state's uh
 
01:29:06.350 --> 01:29:06.360 align:start position:0%
program will not be disclosed by any
 
01:29:08.310 --> 01:29:08.320 align:start position:0%
agency and if law enforcement has any
 
01:29:10.350 --> 01:29:10.360 align:start position:0%
concerns about a residence then they
 
01:29:12.310 --> 01:29:12.320 align:start position:0%
must submit a sworn affidavit which
 
01:29:13.910 --> 01:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
includes the Grower's name and date of
 
01:29:16.109 --> 01:29:16.119 align:start position:0%
birth which must include and then the
 
01:29:19.350 --> 01:29:19.360 align:start position:0%
state agency in the language says may
 
01:29:21.550 --> 01:29:21.560 align:start position:0%
may confirm if they are a designated
 
01:29:23.590 --> 01:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
caregiver the state is not compelled to
 
01:29:25.310 --> 01:29:25.320 align:start position:0%
give this information to law enforcement
 
01:29:27.830 --> 01:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
at all in addition any warrants the law
 
01:29:30.470 --> 01:29:30.480 align:start position:0%
enforcement may have um may have are
 
01:29:31.750 --> 01:29:31.760 align:start position:0%
protected from
 
01:29:34.830 --> 01:29:34.840 align:start position:0%
91a uh inquiries so even neighbors of an
 
01:29:37.189 --> 01:29:37.199 align:start position:0%
illegal growing operation or a grow
 
01:29:38.830 --> 01:29:38.840 align:start position:0%
operation that's outside the confines of
 
01:29:40.430 --> 01:29:40.440 align:start position:0%
the program will have no idea of
 
01:29:42.550 --> 01:29:42.560 align:start position:0%
criminal activity in their CL close
 
01:29:44.990 --> 01:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
proximity if a person violates the bill
 
01:29:46.750 --> 01:29:46.760 align:start position:0%
by growing more marijuana than allowed
 
01:29:48.950 --> 01:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
and selling it to four of their other
 
01:29:50.750 --> 01:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
five potential medical marijuana
 
01:29:53.109 --> 01:29:53.119 align:start position:0%
patients or any else anything else in
 
01:29:55.709 --> 01:29:55.719 align:start position:0%
violation the only punishment so far is
 
01:29:57.950 --> 01:29:57.960 align:start position:0%
a loss of a medical marijuana card I
 
01:29:59.430 --> 01:29:59.440 align:start position:0%
know that there's been some discussions
 
01:30:01.550 --> 01:30:01.560 align:start position:0%
about the extra penalties that Growers
 
01:30:04.470 --> 01:30:04.480 align:start position:0%
have but grower um caregivers caregivers
 
01:30:07.910 --> 01:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
according to um another law that we'll
 
01:30:10.550 --> 01:30:10.560 align:start position:0%
discuss here HB 380 it actually says
 
01:30:13.109 --> 01:30:13.119 align:start position:0%
that they get penalized another felony
 
01:30:15.590 --> 01:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
if they if they sell to non-med
 
01:30:17.750 --> 01:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
marijuana patients so just like a
 
01:30:22.870 --> 01:30:22.880 align:start position:0%
recreational user well funny HB 380 is
 
01:30:25.790 --> 01:30:25.800 align:start position:0%
right now in committee to be you know to
 
01:30:30.149 --> 01:30:30.159 align:start position:0%
be repealed back so in addition um you
 
01:30:31.590 --> 01:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
know the hopes to eliminate the felony
 
01:30:33.310 --> 01:30:33.320 align:start position:0%
for medical marijuana users who sell
 
01:30:35.510 --> 01:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
their marij marijuana to non-medical
 
01:30:38.310 --> 01:30:38.320 align:start position:0%
people when combined with the efforts of
 
01:30:41.149 --> 01:30:41.159 align:start position:0%
hp53 it hamstrings law enforcement
 
01:30:42.870 --> 01:30:42.880 align:start position:0%
Personnel from their Public Safety
 
01:30:45.629 --> 01:30:45.639 align:start position:0%
Mission and it opens up a huge Pandora's
 
01:30:48.229 --> 01:30:48.239 align:start position:0%
Box if we could start wrapping up please
 
01:30:50.910 --> 01:30:50.920 align:start position:0%
yes sir uh lastly I'll just say that
 
01:30:52.669 --> 01:30:52.679 align:start position:0%
this also establishes that atcs can
 
01:30:54.990 --> 01:30:55.000 align:start position:0%
start a new line of business as seedling
 
01:30:57.430 --> 01:30:57.440 align:start position:0%
Distributors this bill allows no limit
 
01:30:59.070 --> 01:30:59.080 align:start position:0%
on the amount of seedlings that they can
 
01:31:01.629 --> 01:31:01.639 align:start position:0%
have and again I just want to say that a
 
01:31:03.390 --> 01:31:03.400 align:start position:0%
lot of these bills as recreational
 
01:31:05.950 --> 01:31:05.960 align:start position:0%
marijuana is diminishing what you're
 
01:31:08.470 --> 01:31:08.480 align:start position:0%
seeing is a flood of bills to open up
 
01:31:11.070 --> 01:31:11.080 align:start position:0%
for the marijuana medical marijuana side
 
01:31:14.109 --> 01:31:14.119 align:start position:0%
of things although well-intentioned um
 
01:31:16.229 --> 01:31:16.239 align:start position:0%
at this time I I think that the
 
01:31:18.350 --> 01:31:18.360 align:start position:0%
oversight is too problematic to pass
 
01:31:21.350 --> 01:31:21.360 align:start position:0%
thank you any
 
01:31:28.669 --> 01:31:28.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:30.750 --> 01:31:30.760 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is Matt Simon
 
01:31:38.910 --> 01:31:38.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:41.550 --> 01:31:41.560 align:start position:0%
cannabis thank you Mr chairman again
 
01:31:44.229 --> 01:31:44.239 align:start position:0%
Matt Simon Granite Leaf cannabis we
 
01:31:46.470 --> 01:31:46.480 align:start position:0%
support this bill I've personally been
 
01:31:50.149 --> 01:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
trying to pass this bill for 18 years I
 
01:31:51.629 --> 01:31:51.639 align:start position:0%
pleased that this committee has passed
 
01:31:53.070 --> 01:31:53.080 align:start position:0%
it many times I'm pleased that the house
 
01:31:54.470 --> 01:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
has passed it many times times I hope
 
01:31:57.590 --> 01:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
this will happen yet again in
 
01:32:00.270 --> 01:32:00.280 align:start position:0%
2025 L been said already I want to focus
 
01:32:03.750 --> 01:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
on first of all for us this is not a
 
01:32:06.470 --> 01:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
bottom line issue we're not expecting to
 
01:32:09.430 --> 01:32:09.440 align:start position:0%
make money off of selling seedlings our
 
01:32:11.830 --> 01:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
team cares about our patients we care
 
01:32:13.790 --> 01:32:13.800 align:start position:0%
about cannabis if our patients want to
 
01:32:16.070 --> 01:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
grow most won't want to grow but those
 
01:32:18.430 --> 01:32:18.440 align:start position:0%
who do our staff would like to teach
 
01:32:20.430 --> 01:32:20.440 align:start position:0%
classes on cultivation we would like to
 
01:32:23.149 --> 01:32:23.159 align:start position:0%
support them any way that we can this is
 
01:32:26.390 --> 01:32:26.400 align:start position:0%
a propati bill for us a freedom issue
 
01:32:29.870 --> 01:32:29.880 align:start position:0%
not a bottom line issue at
 
01:32:32.950 --> 01:32:32.960 align:start position:0%
all so representative Marquel you asked
 
01:32:36.109 --> 01:32:36.119 align:start position:0%
about the policies in other states let's
 
01:32:37.750 --> 01:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
just I want to be really clear about
 
01:32:40.030 --> 01:32:40.040 align:start position:0%
this as New Hampshire's been debating
 
01:32:43.030 --> 01:32:43.040 align:start position:0%
this for the last 12 years every other
 
01:32:45.470 --> 01:32:45.480 align:start position:0%
state in New England has legalized home
 
01:32:48.109 --> 01:32:48.119 align:start position:0%
cultivation of cannabis not just for
 
01:32:50.310 --> 01:32:50.320 align:start position:0%
registered patients but for all adults
 
01:32:54.189 --> 01:32:54.199 align:start position:0%
21 and older who counts the plants in
 
01:32:56.669 --> 01:32:56.679 align:start position:0%
these states nobody it's the same as
 
01:32:58.590 --> 01:32:58.600 align:start position:0%
home brewing it's assumed that people
 
01:33:00.950 --> 01:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
are following the law and if somebody
 
01:33:03.189 --> 01:33:03.199 align:start position:0%
gets arrested and is found to be
 
01:33:05.830 --> 01:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
engaging in an illegal business that is
 
01:33:08.390 --> 01:33:08.400 align:start position:0%
a crime and that's treated as a crime
 
01:33:10.310 --> 01:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
what are the current penalties in New
 
01:33:13.910 --> 01:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire very important it is a felony
 
01:33:17.590 --> 01:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire to quote unquote
 
01:33:20.229 --> 01:33:20.239 align:start position:0%
manufacturer marijuana in any amount
 
01:33:24.470 --> 01:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
over 1 ounce it's an RSA RSA 318 B2
 
01:33:26.709 --> 01:33:26.719 align:start position:0%
controlled Drug Act penalties it's a
 
01:33:30.310 --> 01:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
felony for anybody to grow a plant the
 
01:33:31.790 --> 01:33:31.800 align:start position:0%
bill that you heard about in another
 
01:33:34.189 --> 01:33:34.199 align:start position:0%
committee is trying to repeal a
 
01:33:35.910 --> 01:33:35.920 align:start position:0%
different felony when we passed the
 
01:33:38.109 --> 01:33:38.119 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis law we created a
 
01:33:40.390 --> 01:33:40.400 align:start position:0%
new felony that only applies to
 
01:33:42.669 --> 01:33:42.679 align:start position:0%
registered patients and caregivers who
 
01:33:46.550 --> 01:33:46.560 align:start position:0%
violate the provisions of 126 acts so
 
01:33:48.870 --> 01:33:48.880 align:start position:0%
currently it's actually two felonies if
 
01:33:51.350 --> 01:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
a patient were to be caught growing and
 
01:33:53.470 --> 01:33:53.480 align:start position:0%
they could be charged with both of them
 
01:33:55.510 --> 01:33:55.520 align:start position:0%
the other bill is based on the idea that
 
01:33:58.950 --> 01:33:58.960 align:start position:0%
one felony would be sufficient so it
 
01:34:01.950 --> 01:34:01.960 align:start position:0%
will be a felony if this passes for
 
01:34:04.470 --> 01:34:04.480 align:start position:0%
anybody in New Hampshire to to grow
 
01:34:06.870 --> 01:34:06.880 align:start position:0%
cannabis it would only be exempting
 
01:34:09.590 --> 01:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
registered patients and caregivers who
 
01:34:12.229 --> 01:34:12.239 align:start position:0%
comply with all of the provisions and
 
01:34:13.750 --> 01:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
the requirements that they report the
 
01:34:16.310 --> 01:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
cultivation location
 
01:34:19.270 --> 01:34:19.280 align:start position:0%
Etc representative Nagel you brought up
 
01:34:21.390 --> 01:34:21.400 align:start position:0%
uh other
 
01:34:23.390 --> 01:34:23.400 align:start position:0%
drugs I think that's an important
 
01:34:25.750 --> 01:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
convers ation for us to continue to have
 
01:34:28.109 --> 01:34:28.119 align:start position:0%
because when I look at the laws that are
 
01:34:30.149 --> 01:34:30.159 align:start position:0%
on the books both nationally and in New
 
01:34:32.310 --> 01:34:32.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I don't see a lot of laws that
 
01:34:36.109 --> 01:34:36.119 align:start position:0%
criminalize nature I think that nature
 
01:34:39.030 --> 01:34:39.040 align:start position:0%
is basically there for people to use
 
01:34:41.870 --> 01:34:41.880 align:start position:0%
unless there is a specific prohibition
 
01:34:44.430 --> 01:34:44.440 align:start position:0%
cannabis is a plant that the law and its
 
01:34:46.310 --> 01:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
Majesty has seen fit to prohibit I'm not
 
01:34:48.070 --> 01:34:48.080 align:start position:0%
aware of a law that says I can't go
 
01:34:50.310 --> 01:34:50.320 align:start position:0%
Harvest willow bark if that was
 
01:34:52.189 --> 01:34:52.199 align:start position:0%
something I wanted to do and use it as
 
01:34:55.030 --> 01:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
an alternative to aspirin not saying
 
01:34:57.149 --> 01:34:57.159 align:start position:0%
somebody should do that but I think
 
01:34:59.430 --> 01:34:59.440 align:start position:0%
cannabis can be grown reliably in
 
01:35:01.790 --> 01:35:01.800 align:start position:0%
controlled circumstances and this law
 
01:35:03.910 --> 01:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
would allow for that and most
 
01:35:06.229 --> 01:35:06.239 align:start position:0%
importantly patients are not well served
 
01:35:09.070 --> 01:35:09.080 align:start position:0%
by the threat of felony penalties so
 
01:35:11.350 --> 01:35:11.360 align:start position:0%
thank you any
 
01:35:15.189 --> 01:35:15.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:18.229 --> 01:35:18.239 align:start position:0%
you I'm sorry representative Nagel thank
 
01:35:19.990 --> 01:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thanks for taking my
 
01:35:22.669 --> 01:35:22.679 align:start position:0%
question I I I totally agree with
 
01:35:24.350 --> 01:35:24.360 align:start position:0%
everything that have said about access
 
01:35:27.270 --> 01:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
being a problem um in terms of cost and
 
01:35:29.669 --> 01:35:29.679 align:start position:0%
everything have the dispensaries and
 
01:35:32.590 --> 01:35:32.600 align:start position:0%
whomever um sat down thought about
 
01:35:34.870 --> 01:35:34.880 align:start position:0%
strategies for reducing cost in other
 
01:35:36.790 --> 01:35:36.800 align:start position:0%
ways than than
 
01:35:39.310 --> 01:35:39.320 align:start position:0%
this absolutely we talk about that all
 
01:35:41.629 --> 01:35:41.639 align:start position:0%
the time we certainly hear from patients
 
01:35:43.950 --> 01:35:43.960 align:start position:0%
patients are shop are able to go to
 
01:35:45.870 --> 01:35:45.880 align:start position:0%
neighboring states and see the markets
 
01:35:47.430 --> 01:35:47.440 align:start position:0%
in neighboring states the prices are
 
01:35:49.350 --> 01:35:49.360 align:start position:0%
lower so three of the bills you're
 
01:35:50.910 --> 01:35:50.920 align:start position:0%
hearing today would deal with the cost
 
01:35:54.109 --> 01:35:54.119 align:start position:0%
issue in some way uh the the CB bill
 
01:35:55.590 --> 01:35:55.600 align:start position:0%
from earlier would allow us to produce
 
01:35:58.510 --> 01:35:58.520 align:start position:0%
some products more more affordably the
 
01:35:59.990 --> 01:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
for-profit conversion bill this
 
01:36:02.189 --> 01:36:02.199 align:start position:0%
afternoon would reduce our operating
 
01:36:02.199 --> 01:36:03.149 align:start position:0%
afternoon would reduce our operating
cost

01:36:03.149 --> 01:36:03.159 align:start position:0%
cost
 
01:36:06.830 --> 01:36:06.840 align:start position:0%
substantially uh and this is one that on
 
01:36:10.229 --> 01:36:10.239 align:start position:0%
the patient side would allow patients to
 
01:36:12.070 --> 01:36:12.080 align:start position:0%
to reduce their own costs if they see
 
01:36:15.149 --> 01:36:15.159 align:start position:0%
fit so we're looking at from a bunch of
 
01:36:17.709 --> 01:36:17.719 align:start position:0%
different angles always trying to do the
 
01:36:20.430 --> 01:36:20.440 align:start position:0%
best job we can serving
 
01:36:24.229 --> 01:36:24.239 align:start position:0%
patients any other questions
 
01:36:24.239 --> 01:36:25.350 align:start position:0%
patients any other questions
representative

01:36:25.350 --> 01:36:25.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:36:29.750 --> 01:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
marel thank you Mr chair um just out of
 
01:36:32.109 --> 01:36:32.119 align:start position:0%
curiosity since you're in the business
 
01:36:36.109 --> 01:36:36.119 align:start position:0%
correct okay can't you ship it to
 
01:36:39.350 --> 01:36:39.360 align:start position:0%
people uh cannabis or marijuana is it
 
01:36:41.950 --> 01:36:41.960 align:start position:0%
still called ferally is ferally illegal
 
01:36:45.950 --> 01:36:45.960 align:start position:0%
so uh we absolutely can't ship anything
 
01:36:47.310 --> 01:36:47.320 align:start position:0%
out out of state that would be a
 
01:36:49.629 --> 01:36:49.639 align:start position:0%
cannabis product uh regulated cannabis
 
01:36:51.750 --> 01:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
markets are all entirely
 
01:36:54.470 --> 01:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
inate uh based on the a that everything
 
01:36:56.709 --> 01:36:56.719 align:start position:0%
has to be produced and sold in state
 
01:36:58.470 --> 01:36:58.480 align:start position:0%
right but what I'm suggesting is one of
 
01:37:01.070 --> 01:37:01.080 align:start position:0%
the key issues here that I heard was
 
01:37:03.189 --> 01:37:03.199 align:start position:0%
that people need access because they
 
01:37:05.430 --> 01:37:05.440 align:start position:0%
either can't transport or whatever and
 
01:37:07.270 --> 01:37:07.280 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if there's some sort of
 
01:37:09.310 --> 01:37:09.320 align:start position:0%
way that you can transport directly to
 
01:37:11.109 --> 01:37:11.119 align:start position:0%
your customers and it doesn't
 
01:37:12.830 --> 01:37:12.840 align:start position:0%
necessarily have to be by means of
 
01:37:16.070 --> 01:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
interstate commerce so you mean like a a
 
01:37:18.510 --> 01:37:18.520 align:start position:0%
personal delivery yeah provision almost
 
01:37:22.109 --> 01:37:22.119 align:start position:0%
like delivering pizza well there are
 
01:37:24.669 --> 01:37:24.679 align:start position:0%
states that allow delivery New Hampshire
 
01:37:26.590 --> 01:37:26.600 align:start position:0%
has chosen not to do that and we don't
 
01:37:29.950 --> 01:37:29.960 align:start position:0%
have a bill on that subject thank you
 
01:37:29.960 --> 01:37:31.910 align:start position:0%
have a bill on that subject thank you
other

01:37:31.910 --> 01:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:37:35.709 --> 01:37:35.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:45.310 --> 01:37:45.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:49.709 --> 01:37:49.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:53.109 --> 01:37:53.119 align:start position:0%
morning better better okay very good my
 
01:37:54.669 --> 01:37:54.679 align:start position:0%
wife does like to amplify my voice at
 
01:37:57.589 --> 01:37:57.599 align:start position:0%
home so I'm not used to this um anyway
 
01:38:01.070 --> 01:38:01.080 align:start position:0%
uh I was a member of the 2018 um
 
01:38:02.350 --> 01:38:02.360 align:start position:0%
commission to study legalization and
 
01:38:04.350 --> 01:38:04.360 align:start position:0%
taxation of uh marijuana they called it
 
01:38:06.790 --> 01:38:06.800 align:start position:0%
at the time and uh I was also one of the
 
01:38:08.510 --> 01:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
two people who was uh C tasked with
 
01:38:10.030 --> 01:38:10.040 align:start position:0%
reviewing scientific articles to bring
 
01:38:11.950 --> 01:38:11.960 align:start position:0%
back to the group to discuss I'm also a
 
01:38:13.390 --> 01:38:13.400 align:start position:0%
board member for Advisory Board member
 
01:38:15.270 --> 01:38:15.280 align:start position:0%
for the New Hampshire cannabis
 
01:38:17.709 --> 01:38:17.719 align:start position:0%
Association um and I'd like to address a
 
01:38:18.990 --> 01:38:19.000 align:start position:0%
couple things that were said some of
 
01:38:20.430 --> 01:38:20.440 align:start position:0%
them were brought up already but I think
 
01:38:23.790 --> 01:38:23.800 align:start position:0%
it's important to reiterate um
 
01:38:27.790 --> 01:38:27.800 align:start position:0%
section 175 5B of um production of beer
 
01:38:30.189 --> 01:38:30.199 align:start position:0%
and wine for personal and family use
 
01:38:32.030 --> 01:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
just under 200 gallons or more year
 
01:38:33.229 --> 01:38:33.239 align:start position:0%
allowed if you have two or more adults
 
01:38:35.709 --> 01:38:35.719 align:start position:0%
over 21 and only 100 gallons or less of
 
01:38:37.709 --> 01:38:37.719 align:start position:0%
beer wine if you're just a single adult
 
01:38:40.109 --> 01:38:40.119 align:start position:0%
over 21 in the household uh there are no
 
01:38:41.830 --> 01:38:41.840 align:start position:0%
checks no registry no
 
01:38:44.030 --> 01:38:44.040 align:start position:0%
inspections and I don't think there's
 
01:38:45.910 --> 01:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
been any problems that have been and I
 
01:38:47.470 --> 01:38:47.480 align:start position:0%
haven't seen any problems if there's
 
01:38:50.390 --> 01:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
been any arrests or um anything going on
 
01:38:53.510 --> 01:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
I have not heard of it or seen it um if
 
01:38:56.350 --> 01:38:56.360 align:start position:0%
may exist but we don't see it uh and the
 
01:38:57.550 --> 01:38:57.560 align:start position:0%
commission when we looked at that we
 
01:38:59.390 --> 01:38:59.400 align:start position:0%
also realized that it was not a big
 
01:39:01.109 --> 01:39:01.119 align:start position:0%
issue no one really cared about that
 
01:39:03.629 --> 01:39:03.639 align:start position:0%
because um as far as enforcing it and
 
01:39:05.830 --> 01:39:05.840 align:start position:0%
who's going to check it it works for
 
01:39:08.270 --> 01:39:08.280 align:start position:0%
alcohol and and beer for beer and wine
 
01:39:10.310 --> 01:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
why why mess with it for here uh we
 
01:39:13.149 --> 01:39:13.159 align:start position:0%
allow that for recreational purposes now
 
01:39:16.310 --> 01:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
we're talking about medicine um and you
 
01:39:17.870 --> 01:39:17.880 align:start position:0%
said that there is no Dr drugs that we
 
01:39:19.510 --> 01:39:19.520 align:start position:0%
allow allow medicines that we allow
 
01:39:21.109 --> 01:39:21.119 align:start position:0%
people to make but we do allow people to
 
01:39:22.589 --> 01:39:22.599 align:start position:0%
make a drug we allow people to make the
 
01:39:24.910 --> 01:39:24.920 align:start position:0%
drug alcohol at home for recreational
 
01:39:27.709 --> 01:39:27.719 align:start position:0%
use um this is something that I think if
 
01:39:28.990 --> 01:39:29.000 align:start position:0%
people were able to make their own
 
01:39:30.629 --> 01:39:30.639 align:start position:0%
penicillin and scrape their own bread
 
01:39:32.109 --> 01:39:32.119 align:start position:0%
and take their own willow bark off to
 
01:39:34.629 --> 01:39:34.639 align:start position:0%
make their aspirin they probably would
 
01:39:37.030 --> 01:39:37.040 align:start position:0%
um if it was that expensive you know we
 
01:39:38.990 --> 01:39:39.000 align:start position:0%
hear about insulin prices and Narcan
 
01:39:40.430 --> 01:39:40.440 align:start position:0%
prices and all these other things out
 
01:39:42.470 --> 01:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
there we're doing everything we can to
 
01:39:45.750 --> 01:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
lower drug prices except this this is
 
01:39:47.270 --> 01:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
something that is important to patients
 
01:39:48.790 --> 01:39:48.800 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire has recognized that
 
01:39:51.350 --> 01:39:51.360 align:start position:0%
this is a medicine for patients who need
 
01:39:55.709 --> 01:39:55.719 align:start position:0%
it for their health happiness and
 
01:39:59.390 --> 01:39:59.400 align:start position:0%
well-being um thise not not passing this
 
01:40:01.830 --> 01:40:01.840 align:start position:0%
prevents that uh at a certain level and
 
01:40:02.990 --> 01:40:03.000 align:start position:0%
it was discussed that there are certain
 
01:40:04.790 --> 01:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
strains that we can't get for people and
 
01:40:07.550 --> 01:40:07.560 align:start position:0%
patients uh certain um things that are
 
01:40:10.070 --> 01:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
better for individuals uh we have a very
 
01:40:11.350 --> 01:40:11.360 align:start position:0%
limited market because we only have a
 
01:40:13.310 --> 01:40:13.320 align:start position:0%
few institutions that are allowed to
 
01:40:16.229 --> 01:40:16.239 align:start position:0%
make medicinal cannabis um people do go
 
01:40:18.669 --> 01:40:18.679 align:start position:0%
out of state they are going to go find
 
01:40:20.990 --> 01:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
it from someone else we have very little
 
01:40:22.910 --> 01:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
on the street in New Hampshire that is
 
01:40:25.229 --> 01:40:25.239 align:start position:0%
being sold sold uh from you know elicit
 
01:40:27.070 --> 01:40:27.080 align:start position:0%
elicit purposes it's still there it's
 
01:40:28.550 --> 01:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
going to be for a while until it's
 
01:40:30.189 --> 01:40:30.199 align:start position:0%
completely legalized at the federal
 
01:40:32.830 --> 01:40:32.840 align:start position:0%
level I believe but um I think this is
 
01:40:34.189 --> 01:40:34.199 align:start position:0%
something that is not going to be a
 
01:40:36.629 --> 01:40:36.639 align:start position:0%
pervasive problem uh the amount of
 
01:40:38.910 --> 01:40:38.920 align:start position:0%
people that actually will grow it is way
 
01:40:41.390 --> 01:40:41.400 align:start position:0%
less than we expect that that we I said
 
01:40:43.109 --> 01:40:43.119 align:start position:0%
people in this room I'm I'm saying
 
01:40:45.709 --> 01:40:45.719 align:start position:0%
because I'm not going to grow it I know
 
01:40:47.030 --> 01:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of people that would like to and
 
01:40:48.510 --> 01:40:48.520 align:start position:0%
they're going to start to try it and
 
01:40:49.910 --> 01:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
then they're going to realize how
 
01:40:51.669 --> 01:40:51.679 align:start position:0%
difficult it actually is to get what
 
01:40:55.310 --> 01:40:55.320 align:start position:0%
they're looking for um let I just real
 
01:40:56.950 --> 01:40:56.960 align:start position:0%
quick like to just say that you know
 
01:40:58.550 --> 01:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of poisonous plants out
 
01:41:00.870 --> 01:41:00.880 align:start position:0%
there that I could grow a a Hemlock Farm
 
01:41:02.790 --> 01:41:02.800 align:start position:0%
Nightshade Fox Glove I can make a whole
 
01:41:04.510 --> 01:41:04.520 align:start position:0%
row of the stuff in my backyard with no
 
01:41:06.790 --> 01:41:06.800 align:start position:0%
fence nothing kids can walk in dogs can
 
01:41:08.669 --> 01:41:08.679 align:start position:0%
come and eat it perfectly legal not
 
01:41:10.350 --> 01:41:10.360 align:start position:0%
going to do that but it's perfectly
 
01:41:11.830 --> 01:41:11.840 align:start position:0%
legal in New Hampshire we're talking
 
01:41:12.550 --> 01:41:12.560 align:start position:0%
about something that's going to be
 
01:41:15.589 --> 01:41:15.599 align:start position:0%
locked up secured just like it is at the
 
01:41:18.189 --> 01:41:18.199 align:start position:0%
atc's and um I think there's no reason
 
01:41:20.750 --> 01:41:20.760 align:start position:0%
not to do this to allow people to have a
 
01:41:23.310 --> 01:41:23.320 align:start position:0%
choice to be happy to be healthier and
 
01:41:25.229 --> 01:41:25.239 align:start position:0%
and to to be Freer as people in New
 
01:41:27.310 --> 01:41:27.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so I I beg you to please pass
 
01:41:29.629 --> 01:41:29.639 align:start position:0%
this law pass this bill into law and I'd
 
01:41:31.870 --> 01:41:31.880 align:start position:0%
be happy to take any questions thank you
 
01:41:31.880 --> 01:41:33.910 align:start position:0%
be happy to take any questions thank you
any

01:41:33.910 --> 01:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:41:40.390 --> 01:41:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:49.390 --> 01:41:49.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:51.750 --> 01:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
Mulholland Mr malland you've asked for
 
01:41:54.709 --> 01:41:54.719 align:start position:0%
five minutes I'd prefer it closer to
 
01:41:58.470 --> 01:41:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:02.750 --> 01:42:02.760 align:start position:0%
you turn on your mic there you go sorry
 
01:42:05.669 --> 01:42:05.679 align:start position:0%
first time I testified um I'm the exact
 
01:42:08.189 --> 01:42:08.199 align:start position:0%
person for this bill I'm a patient I'm a
 
01:42:11.070 --> 01:42:11.080 align:start position:0%
disabled veteran um before I came to New
 
01:42:13.350 --> 01:42:13.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire when I finished my service I
 
01:42:16.350 --> 01:42:16.360 align:start position:0%
was on morphine and Oxycodone for uh
 
01:42:19.669 --> 01:42:19.679 align:start position:0%
four years and it it took my ability to
 
01:42:21.750 --> 01:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
be able to speak and and have
 
01:42:24.310 --> 01:42:24.320 align:start position:0%
conversations and interact
 
01:42:26.629 --> 01:42:26.639 align:start position:0%
in the public and when I came to New
 
01:42:28.870 --> 01:42:28.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I realized we had all this
 
01:42:30.750 --> 01:42:30.760 align:start position:0%
access around us not necessarily in New
 
01:42:32.950 --> 01:42:32.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um so I joined the medical
 
01:42:35.830 --> 01:42:35.840 align:start position:0%
program and it's helped me tremendously
 
01:42:38.189 --> 01:42:38.199 align:start position:0%
to uh get off of of the opiods and
 
01:42:41.030 --> 01:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
everything else uh I like a lot of
 
01:42:43.109 --> 01:42:43.119 align:start position:0%
people that are in the program are for
 
01:42:46.189 --> 01:42:46.199 align:start position:0%
pain management and we're on fixed
 
01:42:48.229 --> 01:42:48.239 align:start position:0%
incomes it's very expensive to buy the
 
01:42:50.910 --> 01:42:50.920 align:start position:0%
amount of product that we need to uh
 
01:42:53.270 --> 01:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
help us on our day-to-day activities
 
01:42:55.149 --> 01:42:55.159 align:start position:0%
something like this would help offset
 
01:42:58.629 --> 01:42:58.639 align:start position:0%
that cost um like it said before many
 
01:43:00.430 --> 01:43:00.440 align:start position:0%
people aren't going to grow it it's a
 
01:43:02.510 --> 01:43:02.520 align:start position:0%
very very small minority of people that
 
01:43:05.430 --> 01:43:05.440 align:start position:0%
would do it uh this is so helpful for
 
01:43:07.790 --> 01:43:07.800 align:start position:0%
people like myself I've talked to many
 
01:43:10.709 --> 01:43:10.719 align:start position:0%
people uh I ran for office last year and
 
01:43:13.510 --> 01:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
I was able to go to a lot of doors in in
 
01:43:17.510 --> 01:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
my community to um to discuss stuff like
 
01:43:18.950 --> 01:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
this and there was a lot of support in
 
01:43:21.390 --> 01:43:21.400 align:start position:0%
my community so I know it's not just me
 
01:43:23.510 --> 01:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
I think this would free up a lot of us
 
01:43:25.310 --> 01:43:25.320 align:start position:0%
um instead of just having to go over to
 
01:43:28.310 --> 01:43:28.320 align:start position:0%
Maine or mass or wherever people get
 
01:43:31.870 --> 01:43:31.880 align:start position:0%
their stuff um this is very beneficial I
 
01:43:34.750 --> 01:43:34.760 align:start position:0%
don't think uh the plant number is is
 
01:43:36.910 --> 01:43:36.920 align:start position:0%
very important it's a very arbitrary
 
01:43:39.310 --> 01:43:39.320 align:start position:0%
number same with the amounts um most
 
01:43:40.669 --> 01:43:40.679 align:start position:0%
people are just going to want to grow
 
01:43:42.189 --> 01:43:42.199 align:start position:0%
their medicine and consume it in their
 
01:43:46.589 --> 01:43:46.599 align:start position:0%
house anyway um I just don't see um I
 
01:43:47.950 --> 01:43:47.960 align:start position:0%
don't see this as a problem I don't
 
01:43:49.830 --> 01:43:49.840 align:start position:0%
think it's going to turn anybody into a
 
01:43:51.310 --> 01:43:51.320 align:start position:0%
drug dealer I don't think it's going to
 
01:43:54.750 --> 01:43:54.760 align:start position:0%
turn anybody into uh a criminal we just
 
01:43:57.310 --> 01:43:57.320 align:start position:0%
simply want our medicine and being able
 
01:43:59.950 --> 01:43:59.960 align:start position:0%
to grow a seed and know that I'm G to
 
01:44:02.910 --> 01:44:02.920 align:start position:0%
get what I what I need out of it um as
 
01:44:06.229 --> 01:44:06.239 align:start position:0%
far as strains go if I can if I can find
 
01:44:08.510 --> 01:44:08.520 align:start position:0%
something um in those seeds that work
 
01:44:11.270 --> 01:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
for me I can reproduce it at home I can
 
01:44:13.669 --> 01:44:13.679 align:start position:0%
clone it just like everybody else does
 
01:44:16.550 --> 01:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
around the United States and and outside
 
01:44:19.750 --> 01:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
um this is super helpful because going
 
01:44:21.629 --> 01:44:21.639 align:start position:0%
from strain to strain going to an ATC
 
01:44:23.589 --> 01:44:23.599 align:start position:0%
and trying everything is is very
 
01:44:27.109 --> 01:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
expensive and pretty prohibitive um for
 
01:44:29.109 --> 01:44:29.119 align:start position:0%
people like myself that that have the
 
01:44:31.950 --> 01:44:31.960 align:start position:0%
significant amount of pain to manage so
 
01:44:33.709 --> 01:44:33.719 align:start position:0%
I'm very glad to see this bill come
 
01:44:36.669 --> 01:44:36.679 align:start position:0%
through I hope that it'll be passed and
 
01:44:39.149 --> 01:44:39.159 align:start position:0%
um thank you I'll take any questions
 
01:44:42.109 --> 01:44:42.119 align:start position:0%
being behing thank you very much any
 
01:44:44.310 --> 01:44:44.320 align:start position:0%
questions representative n thank you Mr
 
01:44:46.270 --> 01:44:46.280 align:start position:0%
chair thanks for taking my question I'm
 
01:44:47.990 --> 01:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
just I'm just curious because I was
 
01:44:49.990 --> 01:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
looking at the bill and all the
 
01:44:53.070 --> 01:44:53.080 align:start position:0%
requirements on how you grow set it up
 
01:44:54.510 --> 01:44:54.520 align:start position:0%
you know everything have you looked into
 
01:44:56.270 --> 01:44:56.280 align:start position:0%
what it would cost to do that at your
 
01:44:59.390 --> 01:44:59.400 align:start position:0%
house to just do the setup not actually
 
01:45:02.390 --> 01:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
grow it but sure I I'm familiar I have
 
01:45:04.790 --> 01:45:04.800 align:start position:0%
friends in Maine and and elsewhere that
 
01:45:07.870 --> 01:45:07.880 align:start position:0%
that have attempted it and otherwise um
 
01:45:10.109 --> 01:45:10.119 align:start position:0%
yeah you need basic things like any
 
01:45:17.709 --> 01:45:17.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:21.709 --> 01:45:21.719 align:start position:0%
umt invisible microphone oh sorry this
 
01:45:24.109 --> 01:45:24.119 align:start position:0%
has to be totally invisible from you
 
01:45:26.109 --> 01:45:26.119 align:start position:0%
know the street it has to be a structure
 
01:45:28.950 --> 01:45:28.960 align:start position:0%
of some sort fencing or whatever I I I
 
01:45:30.390 --> 01:45:30.400 align:start position:0%
don't think any patient is going to go
 
01:45:32.229 --> 01:45:32.239 align:start position:0%
out of their way to build a a structure
 
01:45:33.990 --> 01:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
for Three Mature plants I mean you're
 
01:45:36.109 --> 01:45:36.119 align:start position:0%
talking about a very small footprint for
 
01:45:38.149 --> 01:45:38.159 align:start position:0%
for something like that uh most people
 
01:45:39.390 --> 01:45:39.400 align:start position:0%
are probably going to pick a room in
 
01:45:42.270 --> 01:45:42.280 align:start position:0%
their house and and just use it um three
 
01:45:44.709 --> 01:45:44.719 align:start position:0%
plants would take up very small space
 
01:45:47.990 --> 01:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
it's it's nothing um huge so I don't
 
01:45:50.270 --> 01:45:50.280 align:start position:0%
think that would be an enormous task to
 
01:45:50.280 --> 01:45:51.910 align:start position:0%
think that would be an enormous task to
to

01:45:51.910 --> 01:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:45:56.229 --> 01:45:56.239 align:start position:0%
handle thank you for the question other
 
01:45:58.990 --> 01:45:59.000 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none okay thank you sir
 
01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:00.470 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none okay thank you sir
thank

01:46:00.470 --> 01:46:00.480 align:start position:0%

okay um I'd like to
 
01:51:42.870 --> 01:51:42.880 align:start position:0%
reconvene um the next bill to can be
 
01:51:44.229 --> 01:51:44.239 align:start position:0%
considered I want to open the public
 
01:51:48.709 --> 01:51:48.719 align:start position:0%
hearing on hb50 205 FN and recognize the
 
01:51:50.550 --> 01:51:50.560 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor representative Heath
 
01:51:53.069 --> 01:51:53.079 align:start position:0%
Howard thank you Mr chair and honorable
 
01:51:55.550 --> 01:51:55.560 align:start position:0%
committee members uh I'm representative
 
01:51:56.830 --> 01:51:56.840 align:start position:0%
Heath Howard I represent the towns of
 
01:51:58.270 --> 01:51:58.280 align:start position:0%
straford and barington in straford
 
01:52:02.910 --> 01:52:02.920 align:start position:0%
District 4 and I introduced hb25 because
 
01:52:05.030 --> 01:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
of a situation that I had talking with
 
01:52:06.030 --> 01:52:06.040 align:start position:0%
one of my
 
01:52:09.350 --> 01:52:09.360 align:start position:0%
constituents uh so this constituent uh
 
01:52:12.030 --> 01:52:12.040 align:start position:0%
they received Care at the VA and the
 
01:52:13.709 --> 01:52:13.719 align:start position:0%
thing is is that because of the federal
 
01:52:16.149 --> 01:52:16.159 align:start position:0%
illegality of cannabis at the federal
 
01:52:18.629 --> 01:52:18.639 align:start position:0%
level and the fact that this uh
 
01:52:21.109 --> 01:52:21.119 align:start position:0%
constituent went to a federal doctor
 
01:52:23.189 --> 01:52:23.199 align:start position:0%
they weren't able to get uh
 
01:52:26.149 --> 01:52:26.159 align:start position:0%
certification for therapeutic cannabis
 
01:52:28.430 --> 01:52:28.440 align:start position:0%
so that meant that they had to then look
 
01:52:30.629 --> 01:52:30.639 align:start position:0%
for a third party physician and pay out
 
01:52:32.910 --> 01:52:32.920 align:start position:0%
of pocket in order to get their
 
01:52:34.870 --> 01:52:34.880 align:start position:0%
certification I broke my back when I was
 
01:52:37.550 --> 01:52:37.560 align:start position:0%
16 I've I've had multiple surgeries it
 
01:52:40.550 --> 01:52:40.560 align:start position:0%
cost me $50 to get my certification for
 
01:52:43.390 --> 01:52:43.400 align:start position:0%
this individual it cost them
 
01:52:46.669 --> 01:52:46.679 align:start position:0%
$170 to me somebody paying three times
 
01:52:48.430 --> 01:52:48.440 align:start position:0%
the amount to get a certification it
 
01:52:51.229 --> 01:52:51.239 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be that way and if they are
 
01:52:52.950 --> 01:52:52.960 align:start position:0%
going to be paying that much out of
 
01:52:55.669 --> 01:52:55.679 align:start position:0%
pocket at least we could give them a $50
 
01:52:57.790 --> 01:52:57.800 align:start position:0%
rebate in a sense even if they are going
 
01:53:00.069 --> 01:53:00.079 align:start position:0%
to be paying more than twice what I
 
01:53:01.510 --> 01:53:01.520 align:start position:0%
would have had to pay for my
 
01:53:04.350 --> 01:53:04.360 align:start position:0%
certification uh however I have talked
 
01:53:06.149 --> 01:53:06.159 align:start position:0%
to a few people especially over at the
 
01:53:08.830 --> 01:53:08.840 align:start position:0%
TCM o about some of their concerns about
 
01:53:10.990 --> 01:53:11.000 align:start position:0%
this legislation which I was unaware of
 
01:53:12.910 --> 01:53:12.920 align:start position:0%
beforehand in the fact that this could
 
01:53:15.470 --> 01:53:15.480 align:start position:0%
potentially cut 10% of their funding uh
 
01:53:17.430 --> 01:53:17.440 align:start position:0%
I do think that that's a very notable uh
 
01:53:18.910 --> 01:53:18.920 align:start position:0%
thing to bring up because it is a
 
01:53:21.669 --> 01:53:21.679 align:start position:0%
self-funded program and it does kind of
 
01:53:22.990 --> 01:53:23.000 align:start position:0%
bring Delight whether or not there needs
 
01:53:24.390 --> 01:53:24.400 align:start position:0%
to be additional funding if we want to
 
01:53:26.790 --> 01:53:26.800 align:start position:0%
pursue this type of path uh with that
 
01:53:28.510 --> 01:53:28.520 align:start position:0%
being said I'm open to any questions
 
01:53:32.830 --> 01:53:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:35.350 --> 01:53:35.360 align:start position:0%
questions representative Nel the
 
01:53:36.950 --> 01:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
question you don't ask is the one you
 
01:53:38.510 --> 01:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
always wish you ask so I'm G to ask this
 
01:53:42.310 --> 01:53:42.320 align:start position:0%
one anyways I'm can you explain the $170
 
01:53:45.550 --> 01:53:45.560 align:start position:0%
I'm confused about that yes so uh this
 
01:53:47.550 --> 01:53:47.560 align:start position:0%
constituent because they had to look for
 
01:53:49.470 --> 01:53:49.480 align:start position:0%
a third- party physician uh in order to
 
01:53:51.589 --> 01:53:51.599 align:start position:0%
get their certification they had to pay
 
01:53:52.950 --> 01:53:52.960 align:start position:0%
out of pocket because because they don't
 
01:53:55.790 --> 01:53:55.800 align:start position:0%
have uh Insurance since they go to a VA
 
01:53:58.709 --> 01:53:58.719 align:start position:0%
doctor uh so because of this they had to
 
01:54:01.709 --> 01:54:01.719 align:start position:0%
pay I I don't know if it was $170 uh
 
01:54:05.030 --> 01:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
total uh with the certification or uh if
 
01:54:10.069 --> 01:54:10.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:12.990 --> 01:54:13.000 align:start position:0%
fee other
 
01:54:15.830 --> 01:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none okay thank you
 
01:54:15.840 --> 01:54:21.109 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none okay thank you
thank

01:54:21.109 --> 01:54:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:24.270 --> 01:54:24.280 align:start position:0%
you oh o signed up to speak is uh
 
01:54:25.950 --> 01:54:25.960 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas who is a
 
01:54:29.750 --> 01:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:33.189 --> 01:54:33.199 align:start position:0%
bill oh hey it's me again uh for the
 
01:54:35.109 --> 01:54:35.119 align:start position:0%
record I am Wendy Thomas and I represent
 
01:54:38.669 --> 01:54:38.679 align:start position:0%
the town of marac I am here to tepidly
 
01:54:40.870 --> 01:54:40.880 align:start position:0%
support House Bill
 
01:54:43.470 --> 01:54:43.480 align:start position:0%
205 I am a co-sponsor of this bill
 
01:54:45.310 --> 01:54:45.320 align:start position:0%
because I believe we need to begin the
 
01:54:47.709 --> 01:54:47.719 align:start position:0%
conversation of allowing veterans to use
 
01:54:50.709 --> 01:54:50.719 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis through the VA for
 
01:54:55.069 --> 01:54:55.079 align:start position:0%
pain illness and PT P SD the the VA is
 
01:54:57.149 --> 01:54:57.159 align:start position:0%
currently prohibited from certifying
 
01:54:59.550 --> 01:54:59.560 align:start position:0%
patients for the program this is true in
 
01:55:02.790 --> 01:55:02.800 align:start position:0%
every state all patients who use the VA
 
01:55:04.669 --> 01:55:04.679 align:start position:0%
for their medical care and who want to
 
01:55:07.430 --> 01:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
access therapeutic cannabis must go
 
01:55:10.069 --> 01:55:10.079 align:start position:0%
elsewhere for provider
 
01:55:12.870 --> 01:55:12.880 align:start position:0%
certification outside the VA systems
 
01:55:14.950 --> 01:55:14.960 align:start position:0%
veterans effectively don't have health
 
01:55:16.990 --> 01:55:17.000 align:start position:0%
insurance which was what was referenced
 
01:55:19.589 --> 01:55:19.599 align:start position:0%
earlier so the providers that veterans
 
01:55:21.589 --> 01:55:21.599 align:start position:0%
can find in the community charge a
 
01:55:24.430 --> 01:55:24.440 align:start position:0%
significant Fe fee which is cash out of
 
01:55:27.350 --> 01:55:27.360 align:start position:0%
pocket however many other patients not
 
01:55:29.629 --> 01:55:29.639 align:start position:0%
just veterans don't have providers who
 
01:55:32.629 --> 01:55:32.639 align:start position:0%
can certify and those patients find the
 
01:55:35.109 --> 01:55:35.119 align:start position:0%
same providers and pay the same high
 
01:55:38.030 --> 01:55:38.040 align:start position:0%
fees these are not ideal circumstances
 
01:55:41.109 --> 01:55:41.119 align:start position:0%
for any patients I believe our veterans
 
01:55:42.830 --> 01:55:42.840 align:start position:0%
have sacrificed for our country and
 
01:55:45.109 --> 01:55:45.119 align:start position:0%
should be acknowledged however if we
 
01:55:47.830 --> 01:55:47.840 align:start position:0%
exclude p uh veterans which make up a
 
01:55:50.790 --> 01:55:50.800 align:start position:0%
little over 1,500 or roughly 10% of the
 
01:55:52.830 --> 01:55:52.840 align:start position:0%
therapeutic patient count in New
 
01:55:55.629 --> 01:55:55.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we run the risk of financially
 
01:55:57.310 --> 01:55:57.320 align:start position:0%
impacting the program for the other
 
01:56:01.270 --> 01:56:01.280 align:start position:0%
approximately 13,500 patients in New
 
01:56:02.910 --> 01:56:02.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the therapeutic program is
 
01:56:05.709 --> 01:56:05.719 align:start position:0%
self-funded by the annual and now up to
 
01:56:08.629 --> 01:56:08.639 align:start position:0%
three-year licensing fees removing
 
01:56:10.669 --> 01:56:10.679 align:start position:0%
veteran patients could have the
 
01:56:13.069 --> 01:56:13.079 align:start position:0%
unintended consequence of impacting the
 
01:56:15.470 --> 01:56:15.480 align:start position:0%
program's funding going
 
01:56:18.149 --> 01:56:18.159 align:start position:0%
forward the fiscal note on the bill says
 
01:56:20.310 --> 01:56:20.320 align:start position:0%
no impact because even though the
 
01:56:22.310 --> 01:56:22.320 align:start position:0%
program Revenue would be reduced on
 
01:56:24.990 --> 01:56:25.000 align:start position:0%
under this bill the statutory funding
 
01:56:27.790 --> 01:56:27.800 align:start position:0%
structure means that we would Bill we
 
01:56:31.109 --> 01:56:31.119 align:start position:0%
would Bill the atcs for the Lost Revenue
 
01:56:33.910 --> 01:56:33.920 align:start position:0%
so by their math it's Revenue neutral
 
01:56:36.550 --> 01:56:36.560 align:start position:0%
but it's definitely a cost shift to
 
01:56:38.950 --> 01:56:38.960 align:start position:0%
patients so while I acknowledge the
 
01:56:41.229 --> 01:56:41.239 align:start position:0%
sacrifice of our veteran that the these
 
01:56:43.030 --> 01:56:43.040 align:start position:0%
sacrifice our veterans have made to our
 
01:56:45.229 --> 01:56:45.239 align:start position:0%
country and while I firmly believe that
 
01:56:47.830 --> 01:56:47.840 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis should be embraced
 
01:56:50.109 --> 01:56:50.119 align:start position:0%
as a medical modality for our veteran
 
01:56:52.830 --> 01:56:52.840 align:start position:0%
patients I am honestly not sure that
 
01:56:54.790 --> 01:56:54.800 align:start position:0%
this is the best way to approach the
 
01:56:57.830 --> 01:56:57.840 align:start position:0%
issue however I will leave that decision
 
01:57:00.629 --> 01:57:00.639 align:start position:0%
in the capable hands of this committee
 
01:57:02.189 --> 01:57:02.199 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and I'll take any
 
01:57:06.910 --> 01:57:06.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:09.629 --> 01:57:09.639 align:start position:0%
questions okay I'm saying none thank you
 
01:57:09.639 --> 01:57:13.189 align:start position:0%
questions okay I'm saying none thank you
thank

01:57:13.189 --> 01:57:13.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:15.950 --> 01:57:15.960 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Sue
 
01:57:22.910 --> 01:57:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:25.229 --> 01:57:25.239 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um I just want to
 
01:57:26.350 --> 01:57:26.360 align:start position:0%
start by letting you know from
 
01:57:27.910 --> 01:57:27.920 align:start position:0%
perspective wise I've spent seven years
 
01:57:30.390 --> 01:57:30.400 align:start position:0%
on active duty I spent 20 plus years as
 
01:57:32.550 --> 01:57:32.560 align:start position:0%
a military spouse three of my four
 
01:57:34.470 --> 01:57:34.480 align:start position:0%
children are currently on active duty in
 
01:57:37.510 --> 01:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
the Air Force Marines and navy I
 
01:57:40.189 --> 01:57:40.199 align:start position:0%
understand the well-meaning intent of
 
01:57:42.390 --> 01:57:42.400 align:start position:0%
the Prime sponsor I think the the bill
 
01:57:44.310 --> 01:57:44.320 align:start position:0%
is well-intentioned
 
01:57:46.669 --> 01:57:46.679 align:start position:0%
um however we also have to keep in mind
 
01:57:47.910 --> 01:57:47.920 align:start position:0%
the alternative treatment centers
 
01:57:49.790 --> 01:57:49.800 align:start position:0%
already offer discounted product for
 
01:57:54.390 --> 01:57:54.400 align:start position:0%
veterans and um and I if I read the 2022
 
01:57:56.750 --> 01:57:56.760 align:start position:0%
therap therapeutic cannabis program
 
01:57:59.149 --> 01:57:59.159 align:start position:0%
correctly all of the discounts that the
 
01:58:01.750 --> 01:58:01.760 align:start position:0%
atc's give each one of them it seems if
 
01:58:03.550 --> 01:58:03.560 align:start position:0%
I read it correctly is into the tune of
 
01:58:06.709 --> 01:58:06.719 align:start position:0%
a half a million dollars a year and I'm
 
01:58:08.629 --> 01:58:08.639 align:start position:0%
sure U Mr Simon could correct me if
 
01:58:11.310 --> 01:58:11.320 align:start position:0%
that's incorrect uh the concern that I'm
 
01:58:13.350 --> 01:58:13.360 align:start position:0%
here to discuss is that medical studies
 
01:58:15.470 --> 01:58:15.480 align:start position:0%
are still catching up to the narrative
 
01:58:17.109 --> 01:58:17.119 align:start position:0%
that marijuana is safe and effective
 
01:58:20.310 --> 01:58:20.320 align:start position:0%
treatment for PTSD a study published in
 
01:58:22.830 --> 01:58:22.840 align:start position:0%
psychology psychology psychological
 
01:58:26.149 --> 01:58:26.159 align:start position:0%
medicine part of me in 2020 suggest
 
01:58:27.870 --> 01:58:27.880 align:start position:0%
quote cannabis use is linked with
 
01:58:29.750 --> 01:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
greater severity of trauma related
 
01:58:32.629 --> 01:58:32.639 align:start position:0%
intrusion symptoms over time a strong
 
01:58:35.470 --> 01:58:35.480 align:start position:0%
person Le uh level directional
 
01:58:38.229 --> 01:58:38.239 align:start position:0%

01:58:41.189 --> 01:58:41.199 align:start position:0%

01:58:43.390 --> 01:58:43.400 align:start position:0%

individuals with PTSD another quote
 
01:58:52.550 --> 01:58:52.560 align:start position:0%
findings based on the STA statistically
 
01:58:54.910 --> 01:58:54.920 align:start position:0%
rigorous models utilized in our and
 
01:58:57.030 --> 01:58:57.040 align:start position:0%
other perspective studies do not support
 
01:58:59.030 --> 01:58:59.040 align:start position:0%
the widespread State sanctioned medical
 
01:59:01.069 --> 01:59:01.079 align:start position:0%
use of cannabis for the treatment of
 
01:59:03.709 --> 01:59:03.719 align:start position:0%
PTSD for these individuals recommending
 
01:59:05.270 --> 01:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
cannabis cessation and seeking
 
01:59:07.310 --> 01:59:07.320 align:start position:0%
evidence-based treatment for PTSD may
 
01:59:09.069 --> 01:59:09.079 align:start position:0%
help to improve the outcomes and
 
01:59:11.629 --> 01:59:11.639 align:start position:0%
mitigate the risks of cannabis use
 
01:59:15.069 --> 01:59:15.079 align:start position:0%
disorder uh in addition only this past
 
01:59:17.669 --> 01:59:17.679 align:start position:0%
November did the does the VA the VA the
 
01:59:20.189 --> 01:59:20.199 align:start position:0%
FDA just authorized a clinical trial to
 
01:59:22.950 --> 01:59:22.960 align:start position:0%
study using marijuana to treat PSD and
 
01:59:25.350 --> 01:59:25.360 align:start position:0%
Veterans the reason I'm breaking this up
 
01:59:29.669 --> 01:59:29.679 align:start position:0%
is because this illustrates our state's
 
01:59:31.950 --> 01:59:31.960 align:start position:0%
cart before the horse approach when it
 
01:59:34.870 --> 01:59:34.880 align:start position:0%
comes to adding clinical diagnosis on
 
01:59:37.550 --> 01:59:37.560 align:start position:0%
the medical marijuana list of conditions
 
01:59:38.350 --> 01:59:38.360 align:start position:0%
it can
 
01:59:41.669 --> 01:59:41.679 align:start position:0%
treat uh we also are disinterested in
 
01:59:44.310 --> 01:59:44.320 align:start position:0%
actually looking at studies uh that
 
01:59:47.470 --> 01:59:47.480 align:start position:0%
actually um over time can prove like
 
01:59:49.669 --> 01:59:49.679 align:start position:0%
PTSD that there may be some concerns
 
01:59:52.470 --> 01:59:52.480 align:start position:0%
that we have about uh saying that
 
01:59:56.510 --> 01:59:56.520 align:start position:0%
medical marijuana is a is a cure all for
 
02:00:00.830 --> 02:00:00.840 align:start position:0%
that interestingly in 2013 Democratic
 
02:00:04.390 --> 02:00:04.400 align:start position:0%
governor uh Maggie Hassen demanded that
 
02:00:08.390 --> 02:00:08.400 align:start position:0%
in HB 573 at that time to remove PTSD
 
02:00:10.270 --> 02:00:10.280 align:start position:0%
from the Bill's language I mean this
 
02:00:13.390 --> 02:00:13.400 align:start position:0%
isn't necessarily a uh this is a long
 
02:00:15.669 --> 02:00:15.679 align:start position:0%
discussion that we've had in our
 
02:00:19.310 --> 02:00:19.320 align:start position:0%
state the state of New Hampshire is
 
02:00:21.270 --> 02:00:21.280 align:start position:0%
already I would say acting a little
 
02:00:23.510 --> 02:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
irresponsibly by including PTSD in the
 
02:00:25.109 --> 02:00:25.119 align:start position:0%
list of approved medical marijuana
 
02:00:26.750 --> 02:00:26.760 align:start position:0%
conditions our state is currently
 
02:00:28.310 --> 02:00:28.320 align:start position:0%
misleading veterans on the safety of
 
02:00:30.669 --> 02:00:30.679 align:start position:0%
using medical marijuana to treat PSD
 
02:00:33.390 --> 02:00:33.400 align:start position:0%
PTSD and we should not make it easier to
 
02:00:34.669 --> 02:00:34.679 align:start position:0%
mislead them into thinking that
 
02:00:36.990 --> 02:00:37.000 align:start position:0%
marijuana is an appropriate Cure All by
 
02:00:40.510 --> 02:00:40.520 align:start position:0%
removing the $50 fee thank you thank you
 
02:00:40.520 --> 02:00:42.709 align:start position:0%
removing the $50 fee thank you thank you
any

02:00:42.709 --> 02:00:42.719 align:start position:0%
any
 
02:00:48.790 --> 02:00:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:51.109 --> 02:00:51.119 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is
 
02:00:52.430 --> 02:00:52.440 align:start position:0%
representative J
 
02:00:54.790 --> 02:00:54.800 align:start position:0%
kerk I think representative kerk and
 
02:00:56.830 --> 02:00:56.840 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas have a competition
 
02:00:58.030 --> 02:00:58.040 align:start position:0%
as to who's going to speak the most
 
02:00:58.040 --> 02:01:00.310 align:start position:0%
as to who's going to speak the most
today

02:01:00.310 --> 02:01:00.320 align:start position:0%
today
 
02:01:05.350 --> 02:01:05.360 align:start position:0%
but and I'm former not not not active
 
02:01:08.470 --> 02:01:08.480 align:start position:0%
um yes so once again I serve as a chair
 
02:01:10.229 --> 02:01:10.239 align:start position:0%
of the oh for the record my name is
 
02:01:12.069 --> 02:01:12.079 align:start position:0%
Jerry kerk and I serve as the chair of
 
02:01:13.870 --> 02:01:13.880 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire therapeutic cannabis
 
02:01:17.629 --> 02:01:17.639 align:start position:0%
medical oversight board um so you the
 
02:01:19.669 --> 02:01:19.679 align:start position:0%
summary of this again is it would the
 
02:01:21.629 --> 02:01:21.639 align:start position:0%
the bill would exempt veterans from
 
02:01:24.189 --> 02:01:24.199 align:start position:0%
paying the $50 application fee for the
 
02:01:25.950 --> 02:01:25.960 align:start position:0%
program and the card you get is valid
 
02:01:26.950 --> 02:01:26.960 align:start position:0%
for 3
 
02:01:30.189 --> 02:01:30.199 align:start position:0%
years this was a fascinating time in our
 
02:01:32.669 --> 02:01:32.679 align:start position:0%
meeting uh earlier in the month because
 
02:01:34.470 --> 02:01:34.480 align:start position:0%
we really had a hard time reaching any
 
02:01:36.310 --> 02:01:36.320 align:start position:0%
kind of a consensus on this we took
 
02:01:37.709 --> 02:01:37.719 align:start position:0%
three different votes on three different
 
02:01:40.270 --> 02:01:40.280 align:start position:0%
motions and they were all really split
 
02:01:42.229 --> 02:01:42.239 align:start position:0%
the members were very conflicted because
 
02:01:44.430 --> 02:01:44.440 align:start position:0%
though we support the concept of
 
02:01:46.790 --> 02:01:46.800 align:start position:0%
honoring the veterans and reducing
 
02:01:48.830 --> 02:01:48.840 align:start position:0%
barriers to accessing the program we
 
02:01:50.910 --> 02:01:50.920 align:start position:0%
recognize the fiscal impact of this bill
 
02:01:53.030 --> 02:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
upon the therapeutic program the
 
02:01:54.629 --> 02:01:54.639 align:start position:0%
alternative treatment centers and the
 
02:01:57.990 --> 02:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
patients we noted that veterans even
 
02:02:00.109 --> 02:02:00.119 align:start position:0%
those who have not served in combat are
 
02:02:02.750 --> 02:02:02.760 align:start position:0%
more susceptible to PTSD which is an
 
02:02:05.229 --> 02:02:05.239 align:start position:0%
approved qualifying medical condition
 
02:02:06.629 --> 02:02:06.639 align:start position:0%
some members of the board they also
 
02:02:08.470 --> 02:02:08.480 align:start position:0%
pointed out that other professions are
 
02:02:11.350 --> 02:02:11.360 align:start position:0%
equally at risk of PTSD for example law
 
02:02:13.470 --> 02:02:13.480 align:start position:0%
enforcement and firefighters and they
 
02:02:15.069 --> 02:02:15.079 align:start position:0%
would be similarly
 
02:02:17.310 --> 02:02:17.320 align:start position:0%
deserving as been pointed out veterans
 
02:02:19.669 --> 02:02:19.679 align:start position:0%
do face a specific crle because they
 
02:02:22.390 --> 02:02:22.400 align:start position:0%
cannot uh the the VA doc not only will
 
02:02:23.950 --> 02:02:23.960 align:start position:0%
not certify they won't even talk to you
 
02:02:26.310 --> 02:02:26.320 align:start position:0%
about it uh but there's also other
 
02:02:28.910 --> 02:02:28.920 align:start position:0%
patients that face that burden patients
 
02:02:30.790 --> 02:02:30.800 align:start position:0%
of federal League qualified Health
 
02:02:33.310 --> 02:02:33.320 align:start position:0%
Centers and some group practices also
 
02:02:35.350 --> 02:02:35.360 align:start position:0%
are not able to get certified in their
 
02:02:37.189 --> 02:02:37.199 align:start position:0%
practice where they receive their
 
02:02:40.270 --> 02:02:40.280 align:start position:0%
treatment so this would improve access
 
02:02:42.350 --> 02:02:42.360 align:start position:0%
for those few Veterans for which the $50
 
02:02:46.149 --> 02:02:46.159 align:start position:0%
application is a burden but the $50 fee
 
02:02:48.589 --> 02:02:48.599 align:start position:0%
is minor compared to the cost of the
 
02:02:51.430 --> 02:02:51.440 align:start position:0%
product and only some veterans are low
 
02:02:51.440 --> 02:02:53.069 align:start position:0%
product and only some veterans are low
income

02:02:53.069 --> 02:02:53.079 align:start position:0%
income
 
02:02:55.229 --> 02:02:55.239 align:start position:0%
the atcs already are required by allow
 
02:02:57.790 --> 02:02:57.800 align:start position:0%
to give discounts to patients on SSI
 
02:03:00.390 --> 02:03:00.400 align:start position:0%
SSDI and Medicaid and they all also
 
02:03:03.229 --> 02:03:03.239 align:start position:0%
offer discounts on products for
 
02:03:05.709 --> 02:03:05.719 align:start position:0%
veterans and again though the fiscal
 
02:03:08.350 --> 02:03:08.360 align:start position:0%
note states that the impact will be zero
 
02:03:10.069 --> 02:03:10.079 align:start position:0%
that is because of how the program is
 
02:03:12.149 --> 02:03:12.159 align:start position:0%
structured there'll simply be a cost
 
02:03:14.629 --> 02:03:14.639 align:start position:0%
shifting of this lost Revenue to the
 
02:03:16.750 --> 02:03:16.760 align:start position:0%
atcs which therefore goes to the other
 
02:03:19.310 --> 02:03:19.320 align:start position:0%
registered patients since about 10% of
 
02:03:21.830 --> 02:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
our 15,000 registered patients are vet
 
02:03:24.750 --> 02:03:24.760 align:start position:0%
veterans this bill would yield about
 
02:03:26.870 --> 02:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
1,500 patients who would be exempt of
 
02:03:29.589 --> 02:03:29.599 align:start position:0%
the $50 fee they're valid for 3 years so
 
02:03:33.589 --> 02:03:33.599 align:start position:0%
we'd lose about $75,000 of income every
 
02:03:36.030 --> 02:03:36.040 align:start position:0%
3 years but since the program is
 
02:03:39.430 --> 02:03:39.440 align:start position:0%
statutorily mandated to be
 
02:03:42.229 --> 02:03:42.239 align:start position:0%
self-funded this uh will result in
 
02:03:44.589 --> 02:03:44.599 align:start position:0%
higher annual registration fees that are
 
02:03:47.310 --> 02:03:47.320 align:start position:0%
passed on to the atc's and they will
 
02:03:49.830 --> 02:03:49.840 align:start position:0%
have to pass those costs on to the other
 
02:03:52.270 --> 02:03:52.280 align:start position:0%
patients so the fact
 
02:03:54.910 --> 02:03:54.920 align:start position:0%
to the state budget is zero the effect
 
02:03:57.589 --> 02:03:57.599 align:start position:0%
to the other patients is going to be
 
02:04:00.950 --> 02:04:00.960 align:start position:0%
real so in summary even though the
 
02:04:03.750 --> 02:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
members of TCM o strongly agreed with
 
02:04:05.510 --> 02:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
the concept of supporting our veterans
 
02:04:09.030 --> 02:04:09.040 align:start position:0%
and reducing access barriers to access
 
02:04:12.350 --> 02:04:12.360 align:start position:0%
we also recognized the fiscal impact and
 
02:04:14.510 --> 02:04:14.520 align:start position:0%
the cost shifting that will occur and
 
02:04:17.430 --> 02:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
therefore voted to to not support the
 
02:04:21.350 --> 02:04:21.360 align:start position:0%
bill by a margin of 5 to one but with
 
02:04:24.390 --> 02:04:24.400 align:start position:0%
three extensions we it was really a
 
02:04:27.270 --> 02:04:27.280 align:start position:0%
fascinating experience to watch this uh
 
02:04:29.750 --> 02:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
difficulty because we were all so
 
02:04:32.629 --> 02:04:32.639 align:start position:0%
conflicted I'll take any questions okay
 
02:04:32.639 --> 02:04:34.790 align:start position:0%
conflicted I'll take any questions okay
any

02:04:34.790 --> 02:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
any
 
02:04:37.109 --> 02:04:37.119 align:start position:0%
questions seeing no questions sure thank
 
02:04:42.310 --> 02:04:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:44.910 --> 02:04:44.920 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Michael
 
02:04:46.270 --> 02:04:46.280 align:start position:0%
Holt from the New Hampshire Department
 
02:04:48.950 --> 02:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:51.310 --> 02:04:51.320 align:start position:0%
Services and again Mr Hol you asked for
 
02:04:54.350 --> 02:04:54.360 align:start position:0%
five if it's keep keep it closer to
 
02:04:58.669 --> 02:04:58.679 align:start position:0%
three I bet I can do it in two okay for
 
02:05:00.270 --> 02:05:00.280 align:start position:0%
the record my name is Michael Hol I'm
 
02:05:01.629 --> 02:05:01.639 align:start position:0%
the administrator of the therapeutic
 
02:05:02.990 --> 02:05:03.000 align:start position:0%
cannabis program with the Department of
 
02:05:05.390 --> 02:05:05.400 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services um my
 
02:05:06.790 --> 02:05:06.800 align:start position:0%
testimony is going to be very similar to
 
02:05:08.950 --> 02:05:08.960 align:start position:0%
those um who came before me so I'll keep
 
02:05:11.669 --> 02:05:11.679 align:start position:0%
it brief um uh the department does not
 
02:05:15.910 --> 02:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
have a position on this bill um hb25 is
 
02:05:17.629 --> 02:05:17.639 align:start position:0%
a challenging Bill to talk about the
 
02:05:21.149 --> 02:05:21.159 align:start position:0%
program supports removing barriers to
 
02:05:23.270 --> 02:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
patients access the program including
 
02:05:25.669 --> 02:05:25.679 align:start position:0%
costs and fees since the program began
 
02:05:28.310 --> 02:05:28.320 align:start position:0%
in 2016 the program has never raised its
 
02:05:31.430 --> 02:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
fees in fact we have reduced fees we
 
02:05:33.870 --> 02:05:33.880 align:start position:0%
have waved fees and we have even got uh
 
02:05:35.830 --> 02:05:35.840 align:start position:0%
eliminated fees going to the legislature
 
02:05:38.030 --> 02:05:38.040 align:start position:0%
to change the law to uh to to remove
 
02:05:41.629 --> 02:05:41.639 align:start position:0%
some of the fees um recently the program
 
02:05:44.390 --> 02:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
implemented a law change that allows a
 
02:05:46.870 --> 02:05:46.880 align:start position:0%
provider's written certification to be
 
02:05:49.870 --> 02:05:49.880 align:start position:0%
good for up to three years at a time we
 
02:05:52.790 --> 02:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
did not increase our rates it was $50
 
02:05:55.870 --> 02:05:55.880 align:start position:0%
for a year and it's now $50 for three
 
02:05:57.830 --> 02:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
years so every patient on the program
 
02:05:59.830 --> 02:05:59.840 align:start position:0%
has already within the past two years
 
02:06:02.709 --> 02:06:02.719 align:start position:0%
experienc a substantial uh cost savings
 
02:06:05.549 --> 02:06:05.559 align:start position:0%
with regard to our uh uh the patient
 
02:06:09.870 --> 02:06:09.880 align:start position:0%
application fee um and the the program
 
02:06:13.030 --> 02:06:13.040 align:start position:0%
is dealing with a up to two-thirds uh
 
02:06:15.149 --> 02:06:15.159 align:start position:0%
Revenue reduction already based on that
 
02:06:17.589 --> 02:06:17.599 align:start position:0%
uh um that that policy change so
 
02:06:19.390 --> 02:06:19.400 align:start position:0%
ideologically it's challenging to be
 
02:06:21.109 --> 02:06:21.119 align:start position:0%
faced with not being able to support a
 
02:06:24.430 --> 02:06:24.440 align:start position:0%
bill that removes a barrier to access
 
02:06:27.549 --> 02:06:27.559 align:start position:0%
lowers fees for a certain patient
 
02:06:30.270 --> 02:06:30.280 align:start position:0%
population um so as you know this would
 
02:06:32.430 --> 02:06:32.440 align:start position:0%
exempt veterans um we know that the
 
02:06:35.270 --> 02:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
current fee is $50 uh there are 15,000
 
02:06:37.910 --> 02:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
registered patients on the program 1500
 
02:06:39.669 --> 02:06:39.679 align:start position:0%
are veterans that's 10% of our
 
02:06:42.629 --> 02:06:42.639 align:start position:0%
population it's a 10% reduction um in
 
02:06:45.510 --> 02:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
our Revenue $75,000 over three years
 
02:06:48.910 --> 02:06:48.920 align:start position:0%
$25,000 annually um the fiscal note as
 
02:06:50.990 --> 02:06:51.000 align:start position:0%
has been said States no impact but
 
02:06:53.549 --> 02:06:53.559 align:start position:0%
that's due to the self-funding nature of
 
02:06:56.629 --> 02:06:56.639 align:start position:0%
the program which means that the the
 
02:06:58.589 --> 02:06:58.599 align:start position:0%
loss of Revenue will be passed on to the
 
02:07:01.709 --> 02:07:01.719 align:start position:0%
atcs in terms of their registration fees
 
02:07:04.709 --> 02:07:04.719 align:start position:0%
um and then if they can if the atc's or
 
02:07:07.229 --> 02:07:07.239 align:start position:0%
if an ATC can't absorb those costs those
 
02:07:08.629 --> 02:07:08.639 align:start position:0%
uh have the potential of being passed on
 
02:07:10.589 --> 02:07:10.599 align:start position:0%
to to patients themselves I just want to
 
02:07:12.830 --> 02:07:12.840 align:start position:0%
emphasize again no general fund dollars
 
02:07:15.350 --> 02:07:15.360 align:start position:0%
have ever been spent on the startup or
 
02:07:17.510 --> 02:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
the maintenance of this program it's
 
02:07:20.430 --> 02:07:20.440 align:start position:0%
100% funded by patient application fees
 
02:07:24.310 --> 02:07:24.320 align:start position:0%
and ATC licensing fees um and just to
 
02:07:26.310 --> 02:07:26.320 align:start position:0%
close you know the the issue with with
 
02:07:27.629 --> 02:07:27.639 align:start position:0%
regard to Veterans they do face a
 
02:07:29.069 --> 02:07:29.079 align:start position:0%
particular challenge as you've heard
 
02:07:31.229 --> 02:07:31.239 align:start position:0%
they uh the VA is prohibited federally
 
02:07:33.870 --> 02:07:33.880 align:start position:0%
from uh issuing certifications to state
 
02:07:36.189 --> 02:07:36.199 align:start position:0%
legal programs uh marijuana programs and
 
02:07:38.270 --> 02:07:38.280 align:start position:0%
this is the case throughout the country
 
02:07:40.750 --> 02:07:40.760 align:start position:0%
um it's a nationwide issue um but the
 
02:07:42.270 --> 02:07:42.280 align:start position:0%
challenge is not unique to Veterans I
 
02:07:44.790 --> 02:07:44.800 align:start position:0%
would offer and that is um people who
 
02:07:46.870 --> 02:07:46.880 align:start position:0%
receive their Primary Medical Care from
 
02:07:49.149 --> 02:07:49.159 align:start position:0%
federally qualified Health Centers um
 
02:07:51.709 --> 02:07:51.719 align:start position:0%
are also federally prohibited um from uh
 
02:07:53.109 --> 02:07:53.119 align:start position:0%
getting certifications from their
 
02:07:55.510 --> 02:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
providers um and in practice many other
 
02:07:57.669 --> 02:07:57.679 align:start position:0%
patients simply can't find a provider uh
 
02:08:00.030 --> 02:08:00.040 align:start position:0%
to certify them um their provider may be
 
02:08:02.310 --> 02:08:02.320 align:start position:0%
unwilling to certify or they may be part
 
02:08:03.990 --> 02:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
of a practice group that prohibits their
 
02:08:06.910 --> 02:08:06.920 align:start position:0%
doctors from participating all of these
 
02:08:09.750 --> 02:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
patients veterans and U patients who
 
02:08:14.270 --> 02:08:14.280 align:start position:0%
can't find a doctor um they most often
 
02:08:15.990 --> 02:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
end up seeing a provider in the
 
02:08:18.149 --> 02:08:18.159 align:start position:0%
community who advertises cannabis
 
02:08:20.549 --> 02:08:20.559 align:start position:0%
certification most of whom charge a very
 
02:08:25.270 --> 02:08:25.280 align:start position:0%
high fee as you describe um so it's just
 
02:08:26.750 --> 02:08:26.760 align:start position:0%
to reiterate it's not a unique patient
 
02:08:28.790 --> 02:08:28.800 align:start position:0%
to Veterans um although the the federal
 
02:08:30.870 --> 02:08:30.880 align:start position:0%
prohibition is is is a stark one in
 
02:08:34.390 --> 02:08:34.400 align:start position:0%
terms of their access to the program um
 
02:08:36.549 --> 02:08:36.559 align:start position:0%
I'll finish there I'm happy to take
 
02:08:40.470 --> 02:08:40.480 align:start position:0%
questions um if anyone has any any
 
02:08:42.790 --> 02:08:42.800 align:start position:0%
questions representative delus and then
 
02:08:44.549 --> 02:08:44.559 align:start position:0%
representative L
 
02:08:47.189 --> 02:08:47.199 align:start position:0%
montine thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
02:08:48.669 --> 02:08:48.679 align:start position:0%
for taking my
 
02:08:51.470 --> 02:08:51.480 align:start position:0%
question is it cost prohibitive if you
 
02:08:54.270 --> 02:08:54.280 align:start position:0%
you were to say raise the fees across
 
02:08:57.189 --> 02:08:57.199 align:start position:0%
the board to from 50 to 55 for a
 
02:09:00.510 --> 02:09:00.520 align:start position:0%
threeyear certification or I'm not sure
 
02:09:02.430 --> 02:09:02.440 align:start position:0%
is there a way to to sort of balance
 
02:09:05.149 --> 02:09:05.159 align:start position:0%
things out so that the the veterans
 
02:09:09.189 --> 02:09:09.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:11.669 --> 02:09:11.679 align:start position:0%
break we have Ru making Authority where
 
02:09:14.270 --> 02:09:14.280 align:start position:0%
we can change our fees uh by going
 
02:09:16.189 --> 02:09:16.199 align:start position:0%
through rules so what while that is
 
02:09:18.669 --> 02:09:18.679 align:start position:0%
possible um it is not consistent with
 
02:09:20.310 --> 02:09:20.320 align:start position:0%
our approach over the past 10 years
 
02:09:22.109 --> 02:09:22.119 align:start position:0%
which is to not raise fees one of the
 
02:09:24.270 --> 02:09:24.280 align:start position:0%
Hallmarks of our program uh we have some
 
02:09:25.669 --> 02:09:25.679 align:start position:0%
pride in the fact that we haven't raised
 
02:09:29.069 --> 02:09:29.079 align:start position:0%
fees um uh for patients um but you know
 
02:09:30.790 --> 02:09:30.800 align:start position:0%
but it is it is certainly it is
 
02:09:32.629 --> 02:09:32.639 align:start position:0%
certainly possible now that we're facing
 
02:09:34.109 --> 02:09:34.119 align:start position:0%
currently a two-thirds reduction in
 
02:09:37.109 --> 02:09:37.119 align:start position:0%
Revenue because of our not raising fees
 
02:09:38.669 --> 02:09:38.679 align:start position:0%
um uh from a one-year card to a
 
02:09:40.750 --> 02:09:40.760 align:start position:0%
three-year card we are we are facing
 
02:09:43.270 --> 02:09:43.280 align:start position:0%
that um that proposition um the
 
02:09:45.030 --> 02:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
structure in place as you've heard would
 
02:09:48.510 --> 02:09:48.520 align:start position:0%
be uh for us to build the atcs um for
 
02:09:51.750 --> 02:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
that um and we would uh weigh that
 
02:09:55.149 --> 02:09:55.159 align:start position:0%
approach against the approach of raising
 
02:09:59.350 --> 02:09:59.360 align:start position:0%
fees um uh to application fees for
 
02:10:01.709 --> 02:10:01.719 align:start position:0%
certain patient groups um if I had my
 
02:10:05.069 --> 02:10:05.079 align:start position:0%
way I would um and if I looking at it
 
02:10:07.030 --> 02:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
more broadly I would be more interested
 
02:10:09.270 --> 02:10:09.280 align:start position:0%
as the program administrator to um have
 
02:10:12.510 --> 02:10:12.520 align:start position:0%
reduced fees for categorical uh
 
02:10:15.750 --> 02:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
financially disadvantaged uh people um
 
02:10:17.870 --> 02:10:17.880 align:start position:0%
uh Medicaid recipients SSI recipients
 
02:10:20.589 --> 02:10:20.599 align:start position:0%
people on SSDI etc those would be my
 
02:10:24.189 --> 02:10:24.199 align:start position:0%
first choice chice to raise to eliminate
 
02:10:27.310 --> 02:10:27.320 align:start position:0%
or reduce fees people who are by their
 
02:10:29.109 --> 02:10:29.119 align:start position:0%
by their category are financially
 
02:10:31.350 --> 02:10:31.360 align:start position:0%
disadvantaged and as we know veteran
 
02:10:33.709 --> 02:10:33.719 align:start position:0%
status is not necessarily A categorical
 
02:10:36.709 --> 02:10:36.719 align:start position:0%
Financial um hardship
 
02:10:39.149 --> 02:10:39.159 align:start position:0%
class representative lontine and then
 
02:10:41.069 --> 02:10:41.079 align:start position:0%
representative Weber thank you for
 
02:10:43.270 --> 02:10:43.280 align:start position:0%
taking my question did you say that
 
02:10:45.830 --> 02:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
sometimes you do wave the fees and under
 
02:10:45.840 --> 02:10:47.069 align:start position:0%
sometimes you do wave the fees and under
what

02:10:47.069 --> 02:10:47.079 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:10:50.510 --> 02:10:50.520 align:start position:0%
circumstances uh good pickup uh uh the
 
02:10:52.790 --> 02:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
uh the the the time that we waved fees
 
02:10:56.189 --> 02:10:56.199 align:start position:0%
was during covid um where we uh waved
 
02:10:59.310 --> 02:10:59.320 align:start position:0%
caregiver fees to encourage patients to
 
02:11:02.870 --> 02:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
designate caregivers um so that there
 
02:11:05.709 --> 02:11:05.719 align:start position:0%
were opportunities or options in case
 
02:11:07.030 --> 02:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
somebody got sick they could still
 
02:11:09.470 --> 02:11:09.480 align:start position:0%
access their medicine via someone else
 
02:11:12.350 --> 02:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
so we tried to encourage um the uh the
 
02:11:14.830 --> 02:11:14.840 align:start position:0%
the uptake of the caregivers by waving
 
02:11:16.750 --> 02:11:16.760 align:start position:0%
those fees and in fact that was the fee
 
02:11:18.950 --> 02:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
that we ended up uh removing entirely
 
02:11:21.750 --> 02:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
via statute um uh once Co ended
 
02:11:26.030 --> 02:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
um by eliminating the the the fee for um
 
02:11:26.040 --> 02:11:27.470 align:start position:0%
um by eliminating the the the fee for um
for

02:11:27.470 --> 02:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:11:29.629 --> 02:11:29.639 align:start position:0%
caregivers representative Weber and then
 
02:11:29.639 --> 02:11:31.830 align:start position:0%
caregivers representative Weber and then
representative

02:11:31.830 --> 02:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:11:34.430 --> 02:11:34.440 align:start position:0%
Neland I think you actually may have
 
02:11:36.030 --> 02:11:36.040 align:start position:0%
addressed this but I I just want to be
 
02:11:39.030 --> 02:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
sure I've got it clear in my own head so
 
02:11:42.830 --> 02:11:42.840 align:start position:0%
um if we wave the fees for
 
02:11:46.669 --> 02:11:46.679 align:start position:0%
veterans it's not am I correct in
 
02:11:48.549 --> 02:11:48.559 align:start position:0%
understanding it's not that the fees go
 
02:11:52.750 --> 02:11:52.760 align:start position:0%
up for other people but the the cost
 
02:11:55.790 --> 02:11:55.800 align:start position:0%
shortfall in the program is passed
 
02:11:57.470 --> 02:11:57.480 align:start position:0%
around to the
 
02:12:03.310 --> 02:12:03.320 align:start position:0%
atc's and they in turn may need based on
 
02:12:06.549 --> 02:12:06.559 align:start position:0%
whatever their financial models are to
 
02:12:11.229 --> 02:12:11.239 align:start position:0%
raise prices across the board and that's
 
02:12:14.629 --> 02:12:14.639 align:start position:0%
the way it might impact a cost shift on
 
02:12:16.750 --> 02:12:16.760 align:start position:0%
other patients is that do I have that
 
02:12:19.030 --> 02:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
mechanism right yes that's how we've
 
02:12:20.189 --> 02:12:20.199 align:start position:0%
that's how we and other people have
 
02:12:21.870 --> 02:12:21.880 align:start position:0%
testified to frame the issue that is a
 
02:12:24.310 --> 02:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
cost shift down um but as the other
 
02:12:27.709 --> 02:12:27.719 align:start position:0%
representative mentioned um if we were
 
02:12:29.229 --> 02:12:29.239 align:start position:0%
to if the program were to raise their
 
02:12:33.069 --> 02:12:33.079 align:start position:0%
fees for everyone else um then perhaps
 
02:12:34.669 --> 02:12:34.679 align:start position:0%
that cost shift down to the atcs
 
02:12:37.750 --> 02:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be as as great could be either
 
02:12:39.990 --> 02:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
way and I would also offer that um you
 
02:12:43.390 --> 02:12:43.400 align:start position:0%
know it's it it's $25,000 a year split
 
02:12:45.549 --> 02:12:45.559 align:start position:0%
between three different companies so it
 
02:12:48.149 --> 02:12:48.159 align:start position:0%
may not be significant the atc's may be
 
02:12:49.669 --> 02:12:49.679 align:start position:0%
able to absorb those costs so it's not
 
02:12:52.229 --> 02:12:52.239 align:start position:0%
necessarily the prices will be increased
 
02:12:54.830 --> 02:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
um however they may not be able to lower
 
02:12:57.830 --> 02:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
their prices as quickly um and as we've
 
02:12:59.950 --> 02:12:59.960 align:start position:0%
seen cost is a is is a great barrier to
 
02:13:02.790 --> 02:13:02.800 align:start position:0%
accessing um the product um and and so
 
02:13:04.669 --> 02:13:04.679 align:start position:0%
it may not be a Ono one we have to raise
 
02:13:06.750 --> 02:13:06.760 align:start position:0%
our prices but they may not come down as
 
02:13:09.830 --> 02:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
quickly um so thank you thank you for
 
02:13:12.350 --> 02:13:12.360 align:start position:0%
that clarification representative
 
02:13:16.589 --> 02:13:16.599 align:start position:0%
nagan all set any other
 
02:13:18.950 --> 02:13:18.960 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none okay thank you
 
02:13:24.270 --> 02:13:24.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:30.310 --> 02:13:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:33.390 --> 02:13:33.400 align:start position:0%
molland and and once again sir you asked
 
02:13:35.350 --> 02:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
for five please try to keep it to three
 
02:13:37.669 --> 02:13:37.679 align:start position:0%
this will take a minute okay I just want
 
02:13:39.910 --> 02:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
to say somebody like myself uh I get
 
02:13:42.109 --> 02:13:42.119 align:start position:0%
seen at the VA and when I went for
 
02:13:44.790 --> 02:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
certification uh I have to establish uh
 
02:13:46.669 --> 02:13:46.679 align:start position:0%
a relationship with another doctor that
 
02:13:49.270 --> 02:13:49.280 align:start position:0%
I'm not normally going to see uh some
 
02:13:51.510 --> 02:13:51.520 align:start position:0%
websites if you look online require
 
02:13:54.030 --> 02:13:54.040 align:start position:0%
three four uh visits at
 
02:13:57.549 --> 02:13:57.559 align:start position:0%
$150 plus each um again this is not a
 
02:13:59.510 --> 02:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
doctor I necessarily want to treat me
 
02:14:01.109 --> 02:14:01.119 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to get certification as
 
02:14:03.750 --> 02:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
a as a VA individual I can't get it at
 
02:14:07.750 --> 02:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
there so um I don't know how to reduce
 
02:14:10.069 --> 02:14:10.079 align:start position:0%
those costs for veterans I I agree that
 
02:14:12.750 --> 02:14:12.760 align:start position:0%
this bill is somewhere in the middle and
 
02:14:15.069 --> 02:14:15.079 align:start position:0%
um I can understand the split votes here
 
02:14:18.830 --> 02:14:18.840 align:start position:0%
but overall at least for veterans uh in
 
02:14:20.589 --> 02:14:20.599 align:start position:0%
some cases we have to incur hundreds of
 
02:14:23.350 --> 02:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
dollars uh and then a $50 fee just to
 
02:14:25.669 --> 02:14:25.679 align:start position:0%
get our card and uh I don't know how to
 
02:14:29.069 --> 02:14:29.079 align:start position:0%
reduce that overall or or limit the um
 
02:14:31.069 --> 02:14:31.079 align:start position:0%
the financial exposure that we have many
 
02:14:33.310 --> 02:14:33.320 align:start position:0%
of us being on fixed incomes and this is
 
02:14:36.270 --> 02:14:36.280 align:start position:0%
something that many of us actually need
 
02:14:38.790 --> 02:14:38.800 align:start position:0%
um that's all I have if there's any
 
02:14:41.270 --> 02:14:41.280 align:start position:0%
questions sure thank you representative
 
02:14:44.149 --> 02:14:44.159 align:start position:0%
Nagel thank you Mr chairman thanks for
 
02:14:48.069 --> 02:14:48.079 align:start position:0%
taking my question this is a would you
 
02:14:50.790 --> 02:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
believe I'm I'm so impressed that you've
 
02:14:52.589 --> 02:14:52.599 align:start position:0%
been able to find a doctor that only
 
02:14:55.229 --> 02:14:55.239 align:start position:0%
charges $120 for this so would you
 
02:14:56.950 --> 02:14:56.960 align:start position:0%
believe that most doctors charge
 
02:14:58.709 --> 02:14:58.719 align:start position:0%
substantially more than that's why would
 
02:15:00.109 --> 02:15:00.119 align:start position:0%
you believe that the cost is probably
 
02:15:02.950 --> 02:15:02.960 align:start position:0%
dramatically higher I I fully agree I I
 
02:15:06.270 --> 02:15:06.280 align:start position:0%
got pretty lucky um when I when I found
 
02:15:09.430 --> 02:15:09.440 align:start position:0%
uh somebody to certify me and um you
 
02:15:11.910 --> 02:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
know insurance doesn't cover that it it
 
02:15:13.750 --> 02:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
comes completely out of the pocket so
 
02:15:14.990 --> 02:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
you know if it helps veterans in the
 
02:15:18.669 --> 02:15:18.679 align:start position:0%
future um that's what my hope is thank
 
02:15:21.109 --> 02:15:21.119 align:start position:0%
you represent represented Woods thank
 
02:15:22.750 --> 02:15:22.760 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and uh thank you for taking
 
02:15:24.470 --> 02:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
my question which you may not be able to
 
02:15:27.430 --> 02:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
answer uh do you have any insight as to
 
02:15:30.149 --> 02:15:30.159 align:start position:0%
the prevalence of the a similar problem
 
02:15:32.629 --> 02:15:32.639 align:start position:0%
in the general medical field in other
 
02:15:35.510 --> 02:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
words other than veterans are there
 
02:15:38.390 --> 02:15:38.400 align:start position:0%
people who uh similarly find their
 
02:15:38.400 --> 02:15:39.990 align:start position:0%
people who uh similarly find their
physician

02:15:39.990 --> 02:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
physician
 
02:15:42.149 --> 02:15:42.159 align:start position:0%
either just doesn't want to or doesn't
 
02:15:45.270 --> 02:15:45.280 align:start position:0%
feel qualified and they also then have
 
02:15:48.069 --> 02:15:48.079 align:start position:0%
to get another relationship do we have
 
02:15:51.470 --> 02:15:51.480 align:start position:0%
any insight as to the prevalence of that
 
02:15:54.589 --> 02:15:54.599 align:start position:0%
I can offer antidotal uh evidence said
 
02:15:56.390 --> 02:15:56.400 align:start position:0%
you may not able to answer the question
 
02:15:59.189 --> 02:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
but I did reach out to um like my kids
 
02:16:00.790 --> 02:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
physicians to see if they would take me
 
02:16:02.510 --> 02:16:02.520 align:start position:0%
as a new patient I'd have to go through
 
02:16:04.589 --> 02:16:04.599 align:start position:0%
that process and many of them already
 
02:16:06.109 --> 02:16:06.119 align:start position:0%
said that they would not certify they
 
02:16:09.790 --> 02:16:09.800 align:start position:0%
didn't feel comfortable um doing so so
 
02:16:13.510 --> 02:16:13.520 align:start position:0%
um I was stuck to Google and hopefully
 
02:16:14.950 --> 02:16:14.960 align:start position:0%
you know finding somebody that would do
 
02:16:17.109 --> 02:16:17.119 align:start position:0%
it but I would imagine other people in
 
02:16:19.189 --> 02:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
similar situations would run into the
 
02:16:21.549 --> 02:16:21.559 align:start position:0%
similar similar events
 
02:16:24.910 --> 02:16:24.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question other
 
02:16:27.109 --> 02:16:27.119 align:start position:0%
questions seeing no other questions
 
02:16:32.589 --> 02:16:32.599 align:start position:0%

chair which means I go through all of
 
02:17:43.110 --> 02:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
the bills that are coming before the
 
02:17:45.150 --> 02:17:45.160 align:start position:0%
Senate and the house and the ones that
 
02:17:47.469 --> 02:17:47.479 align:start position:0%
have veteran impact we discuss those at
 
02:17:49.509 --> 02:17:49.519 align:start position:0%
our monthly meeting and we come up with
 
02:17:51.190 --> 02:17:51.200 align:start position:0%
a position and then I come and tell you
 
02:17:53.190 --> 02:17:53.200 align:start position:0%
what that position is and I thank you
 
02:17:55.150 --> 02:17:55.160 align:start position:0%
for indulging me because this is a
 
02:17:56.870 --> 02:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
committee that I don't see very often to
 
02:17:59.830 --> 02:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
be honest with you I I tend to see I'm
 
02:18:02.070 --> 02:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
over over in state federal uh uh
 
02:18:03.709 --> 02:18:03.719 align:start position:0%
relations and Veteran Affairs is kind of
 
02:18:05.910 --> 02:18:05.920 align:start position:0%
where I do most of of the work that I do
 
02:18:07.830 --> 02:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
we're we're tracking 18 Bills going
 
02:18:10.669 --> 02:18:10.679 align:start position:0%
through on this particular go around
 
02:18:12.709 --> 02:18:12.719 align:start position:0%
this bill did not Garner a lot of what
 
02:18:14.349 --> 02:18:14.359 align:start position:0%
you'd call support when we talked about
 
02:18:17.429 --> 02:18:17.439 align:start position:0%
it and I would say in opposition is
 
02:18:20.070 --> 02:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
really a stronger word than what we felt
 
02:18:21.790 --> 02:18:21.800 align:start position:0%
we we was more like we just don't
 
02:18:25.950 --> 02:18:25.960 align:start position:0%
support it and the reason for that is
 
02:18:29.790 --> 02:18:29.800 align:start position:0%
that the legislature has done an
 
02:18:31.790 --> 02:18:31.800 align:start position:0%
exceptional job almost across the board
 
02:18:33.830 --> 02:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
of trying to do things for veterans
 
02:18:37.230 --> 02:18:37.240 align:start position:0%
every single chance that they get and
 
02:18:39.309 --> 02:18:39.319 align:start position:0%
all of us in that room when we discuss
 
02:18:41.549 --> 02:18:41.559 align:start position:0%
this are taxpayers just like all of you
 
02:18:43.509 --> 02:18:43.519 align:start position:0%
and all of all of us know that as a
 
02:18:46.669 --> 02:18:46.679 align:start position:0%
state we're facing a budget shortfall
 
02:18:48.230 --> 02:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
now I know some of the budget people
 
02:18:49.669 --> 02:18:49.679 align:start position:0%
might say well I find that kind of money
 
02:18:52.469 --> 02:18:52.479 align:start position:0%
in my in the seat cushions of my sofa at
 
02:18:57.349 --> 02:18:57.359 align:start position:0%
home but um to us number one we don't
 
02:19:00.150 --> 02:19:00.160 align:start position:0%
want the impression that every time you
 
02:19:02.150 --> 02:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
see Kevin Grady up here he's got his
 
02:19:04.030 --> 02:19:04.040 align:start position:0%
hand out looking for money for veterans
 
02:19:06.110 --> 02:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
we don't want that to be the impression
 
02:19:09.110 --> 02:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
that we leave you and as taxpayers too
 
02:19:11.830 --> 02:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
we feel like this this is one of those
 
02:19:13.910 --> 02:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
ones we can pass on in other words this
 
02:19:16.070 --> 02:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
is one of those ones where it doesn't
 
02:19:18.469 --> 02:19:18.479 align:start position:0%
affect a large enough number of veterans
 
02:19:21.230 --> 02:19:21.240 align:start position:0%
that we're as concerned about it and and
 
02:19:23.509 --> 02:19:23.519 align:start position:0%
quite frankly it doesn't Target the kind
 
02:19:25.629 --> 02:19:25.639 align:start position:0%
of Veterans for help that we're looking
 
02:19:27.629 --> 02:19:27.639 align:start position:0%
for the folks with the traumatic brain
 
02:19:28.910 --> 02:19:28.920 align:start position:0%
injury that are never going to be able
 
02:19:30.429 --> 02:19:30.439 align:start position:0%
to work again those are the people we
 
02:19:33.150 --> 02:19:33.160 align:start position:0%
want to see the property tax exemptions
 
02:19:35.629 --> 02:19:35.639 align:start position:0%
for and some of those kinds of things so
 
02:19:37.790 --> 02:19:37.800 align:start position:0%
this was one where we decided that the
 
02:19:39.830 --> 02:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
political capital capital was more than
 
02:19:42.429 --> 02:19:42.439 align:start position:0%
we were willing to expend I guess to use
 
02:19:44.950 --> 02:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
a political term on this and so we we we
 
02:19:47.429 --> 02:19:47.439 align:start position:0%
do not support this legislation and I'll
 
02:19:48.870 --> 02:19:48.880 align:start position:0%
take any questions that you happen to
 
02:19:51.389 --> 02:19:51.399 align:start position:0%
have I I see the representative has one
 
02:19:52.550 --> 02:19:52.560 align:start position:0%
uh representative Weber and then
 
02:19:52.560 --> 02:19:54.630 align:start position:0%
uh representative Weber and then
representative

02:19:54.630 --> 02:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:19:59.070 --> 02:19:59.080 align:start position:0%
Nagel so I heard in the course of that
 
02:20:02.230 --> 02:20:02.240 align:start position:0%
lukewarm support not
 
02:20:07.270 --> 02:20:07.280 align:start position:0%
opposing and um not supporting is that
 
02:20:09.389 --> 02:20:09.399 align:start position:0%
how do I write that down on my notes is
 
02:20:12.030 --> 02:20:12.040 align:start position:0%
that no position or is that officially I
 
02:20:14.070 --> 02:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
have it down in my in my notes as
 
02:20:16.349 --> 02:20:16.359 align:start position:0%
opposition we opposed this bill that was
 
02:20:19.349 --> 02:20:19.359 align:start position:0%
what the vote was but the discussion was
 
02:20:23.070 --> 02:20:23.080 align:start position:0%
mostly that we that that we didn't see
 
02:20:24.910 --> 02:20:24.920 align:start position:0%
the need for this legislation in the
 
02:20:26.429 --> 02:20:26.439 align:start position:0%
grand scheme of things of all the other
 
02:20:27.950 --> 02:20:27.960 align:start position:0%
things that we're looking at not only
 
02:20:30.309 --> 02:20:30.319 align:start position:0%
this go around but other go arounds
 
02:20:31.510 --> 02:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for that
 
02:20:33.990 --> 02:20:34.000 align:start position:0%
clarification representative Nagel thank
 
02:20:36.070 --> 02:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
02:20:39.190 --> 02:20:39.200 align:start position:0%
question um I'm a little confused my
 
02:20:41.429 --> 02:20:41.439 align:start position:0%
specialty is pain management um I've
 
02:20:43.110 --> 02:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
done a lot of work with veterans over
 
02:20:46.110 --> 02:20:46.120 align:start position:0%
the years the incidence of pain in
 
02:20:49.630 --> 02:20:49.640 align:start position:0%
combat vets is about 60% of chronic pain
 
02:20:53.469 --> 02:20:53.479 align:start position:0%
lifelong the most common use of cannabis
 
02:20:55.030 --> 02:20:55.040 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis is actually for
 
02:20:58.429 --> 02:20:58.439 align:start position:0%
pain not PTSD so what I'm confused about
 
02:21:00.230 --> 02:21:00.240 align:start position:0%
is it would seem to me that this would
 
02:21:03.990 --> 02:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
be a good thing for um managing that
 
02:21:06.950 --> 02:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
element of of veterans and I will say
 
02:21:08.910 --> 02:21:08.920 align:start position:0%
that in my experience people kind of
 
02:21:11.750 --> 02:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
neglect that aspect of of their care and
 
02:21:13.790 --> 02:21:13.800 align:start position:0%
to me this is a good statement wouldn't
 
02:21:13.800 --> 02:21:16.550 align:start position:0%
to me this is a good statement wouldn't
it

02:21:16.550 --> 02:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:19.190 --> 02:21:19.200 align:start position:0%
be I'm I'm certainly not an expert on
 
02:21:21.550 --> 02:21:21.560 align:start position:0%
marijuana I I've never never smoked
 
02:21:24.349 --> 02:21:24.359 align:start position:0%
marijuana even when I was a kid and and
 
02:21:25.990 --> 02:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
it's not just because I'm a goodie two
 
02:21:28.429 --> 02:21:28.439 align:start position:0%
shoes which I am a little bit but it's
 
02:21:30.830 --> 02:21:30.840 align:start position:0%
it's also because I grew up in a home
 
02:21:32.750 --> 02:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
with two two parents that smoke two
 
02:21:34.270 --> 02:21:34.280 align:start position:0%
packs of cigarettes a day I don't want
 
02:21:37.150 --> 02:21:37.160 align:start position:0%
the smoke in my in my system and I
 
02:21:38.190 --> 02:21:38.200 align:start position:0%
understand that there are gummies and
 
02:21:39.630 --> 02:21:39.640 align:start position:0%
other things and if I got to the point
 
02:21:41.510 --> 02:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
where I needed this that might be
 
02:21:43.830 --> 02:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
something that I would look at I I I
 
02:21:46.790 --> 02:21:46.800 align:start position:0%
think that a a better Source here a
 
02:21:49.349 --> 02:21:49.359 align:start position:0%
better I don't know better better tack
 
02:21:50.870 --> 02:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
would be to try to get our congrat
 
02:21:52.990 --> 02:21:53.000 align:start position:0%
delegation to work with the VA and and
 
02:21:54.550 --> 02:21:54.560 align:start position:0%
see if we can't just get this thing
 
02:21:56.950 --> 02:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
fixed and get this stuff def dispensed
 
02:21:59.150 --> 02:21:59.160 align:start position:0%
through the VA uh again I don't know
 
02:22:01.230 --> 02:22:01.240 align:start position:0%
what the political will is to do that
 
02:22:03.349 --> 02:22:03.359 align:start position:0%
but that would seem a better solution
 
02:22:08.230 --> 02:22:08.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:11.349 --> 02:22:11.359 align:start position:0%
workaround other
 
02:22:13.670 --> 02:22:13.680 align:start position:0%
questions say no other questions thank
 
02:22:19.270 --> 02:22:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:21.550 --> 02:22:21.560 align:start position:0%

e good afternoon everyone welcome
 
03:37:21.150 --> 03:37:21.160 align:start position:0%
back we uh have two more hearings to be
 
03:37:23.550 --> 03:37:23.560 align:start position:0%
conducted today the first one will be on
 
03:37:26.990 --> 03:37:27.000 align:start position:0%
House Bill 301 and I will recognize
 
03:37:29.070 --> 03:37:29.080 align:start position:0%
representative Su representative Suzanne
 
03:37:30.990 --> 03:37:31.000 align:start position:0%
Vale for the purposes of introducing the
 
03:37:35.630 --> 03:37:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:38.790 --> 03:37:38.800 align:start position:0%
Vale thank you Mr chair and um thank you
 
03:37:40.349 --> 03:37:40.359 align:start position:0%
to The Honorable members of this
 
03:37:43.429 --> 03:37:43.439 align:start position:0%
committee for hearing my bill um today
 
03:37:45.870 --> 03:37:45.880 align:start position:0%
I'm Suzanne Vale and I'm state
 
03:37:48.630 --> 03:37:48.640 align:start position:0%
representative from ward 3 in NASA which
 
03:37:52.110 --> 03:37:52.120 align:start position:0%
is Hillsboro County 6 and I'm here to
 
03:37:53.590 --> 03:37:53.600 align:start position:0%
present House Bill
 
03:37:56.750 --> 03:37:56.760 align:start position:0%
301 which is relative to the cultivation
 
03:37:59.309 --> 03:37:59.319 align:start position:0%
locations for alter alternative
 
03:37:59.319 --> 03:38:00.389 align:start position:0%
locations for alter alternative
treatment

03:38:00.389 --> 03:38:00.399 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
03:38:02.910 --> 03:38:02.920 align:start position:0%
centers um if you have the bill before
 
03:38:05.670 --> 03:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
you I think it's easiest to just look at
 
03:38:10.229 --> 03:38:10.239 align:start position:0%
it and um line by line what we are
 
03:38:13.229 --> 03:38:13.239 align:start position:0%
asking for is for the alternative
 
03:38:16.950 --> 03:38:16.960 align:start position:0%
treatment centers to be able to to have
 
03:38:19.510 --> 03:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
additional locations for cultivation
 
03:38:24.670 --> 03:38:24.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:28.790 --> 03:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
greenhouse these green houses would be
 
03:38:31.030 --> 03:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
the same they would go under the same
 
03:38:34.269 --> 03:38:34.279 align:start position:0%
rigorous Town approval before being able
 
03:38:39.469 --> 03:38:39.479 align:start position:0%
to have rules adopted um the department
 
03:38:42.309 --> 03:38:42.319 align:start position:0%
will work with the town
 
03:38:45.110 --> 03:38:45.120 align:start position:0%
government as far as it needs to be
 
03:38:47.910 --> 03:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
during during this bill so you may
 
03:38:49.630 --> 03:38:49.640 align:start position:0%
recall that this bill went through the
 
03:38:52.910 --> 03:38:52.920 align:start position:0%
legislature last year but it was vetoed
 
03:38:55.030 --> 03:38:55.040 align:start position:0%
by the governor and he was concerned
 
03:38:55.950 --> 03:38:55.960 align:start position:0%
that it was
 
03:38:58.910 --> 03:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
unregulated um at the time and so his
 
03:39:01.429 --> 03:39:01.439 align:start position:0%
concerns were well listened to but we
 
03:39:04.990 --> 03:39:05.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to just continue to assert that
 
03:39:08.110 --> 03:39:08.120 align:start position:0%
this bill really is about an additional
 
03:39:10.910 --> 03:39:10.920 align:start position:0%
location and it's not about imposing
 
03:39:15.469 --> 03:39:15.479 align:start position:0%
this location on a town I ATC would have
 
03:39:18.110 --> 03:39:18.120 align:start position:0%
to go through the rigorous Town
 
03:39:20.830 --> 03:39:20.840 align:start position:0%
approvals that need to happen in order
 
03:39:23.150 --> 03:39:23.160 align:start position:0%
for this to take place and there's a lot
 
03:39:25.229 --> 03:39:25.239 align:start position:0%
of good reasons why this bill would be
 
03:39:27.110 --> 03:39:27.120 align:start position:0%
helpful but I'm just going to give you a
 
03:39:29.670 --> 03:39:29.680 align:start position:0%
couple of um overview and then I believe
 
03:39:31.790 --> 03:39:31.800 align:start position:0%
that there's a lot of testimony behind
 
03:39:36.349 --> 03:39:36.359 align:start position:0%
me that will um make it come into view
 
03:39:37.950 --> 03:39:37.960 align:start position:0%
let me just pull up my
 
03:39:37.960 --> 03:39:39.990 align:start position:0%
let me just pull up my
thing

03:39:39.990 --> 03:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
thing
 
03:39:44.269 --> 03:39:44.279 align:start position:0%
sorry so the atcs are currently required
 
03:39:47.030 --> 03:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
to cultivate cannabis in an enclosed and
 
03:39:49.910 --> 03:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
locked facility this means they must
 
03:39:53.950 --> 03:39:53.960 align:start position:0%
grow under high-intensity lights and um
 
03:39:57.750 --> 03:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
those are not the same as using sunshine
 
03:40:00.670 --> 03:40:00.680 align:start position:0%
and utilizing natural sunlight changes
 
03:40:03.830 --> 03:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
the product that we actually can
 
03:40:06.950 --> 03:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
create Greenhouse cultivation is more
 
03:40:09.030 --> 03:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
economical for many reasons that are
 
03:40:10.630 --> 03:40:10.640 align:start position:0%
probably pretty obvious the
 
03:40:12.429 --> 03:40:12.439 align:start position:0%
high-intensity lights and the energy
 
03:40:15.429 --> 03:40:15.439 align:start position:0%
bills are incredibly expensive and and
 
03:40:18.150 --> 03:40:18.160 align:start position:0%
this gets passed on to the patient you
 
03:40:20.750 --> 03:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
know as it's
 
03:40:22.870 --> 03:40:22.880 align:start position:0%
unavoidable allowing Greenhouse
 
03:40:26.030 --> 03:40:26.040 align:start position:0%
cultivation would also make um result in
 
03:40:28.590 --> 03:40:28.600 align:start position:0%
more affordable cannabis for the
 
03:40:31.750 --> 03:40:31.760 align:start position:0%
patients who are involved in the
 
03:40:34.950 --> 03:40:34.960 align:start position:0%
program neighboring states also allow
 
03:40:37.590 --> 03:40:37.600 align:start position:0%
green houses in order to support their
 
03:40:37.600 --> 03:40:39.269 align:start position:0%
green houses in order to support their
medical

03:40:39.269 --> 03:40:39.279 align:start position:0%
medical
 
03:40:42.349 --> 03:40:42.359 align:start position:0%
dispensaries and with that I close my
 
03:40:44.309 --> 03:40:44.319 align:start position:0%
testimony but I'm happy to take any
 
03:40:47.030 --> 03:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
questions that can um that can help the
 
03:40:52.550 --> 03:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:55.269 --> 03:40:55.279 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none okay thank you
 
03:41:01.590 --> 03:41:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:03.990 --> 03:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
shair also signed up to speak as
 
03:41:08.349 --> 03:41:08.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:11.269 --> 03:41:11.279 align:start position:0%
Thomas like a bad
 
03:41:13.790 --> 03:41:13.800 align:start position:0%
penny for the record in case you have
 
03:41:16.349 --> 03:41:16.359 align:start position:0%
forgotten I am Wendy Tom and I represent
 
03:41:19.269 --> 03:41:19.279 align:start position:0%
the town of marac I am here in support
 
03:41:21.550 --> 03:41:21.560 align:start position:0%
of House Bill 301 which is an act
 
03:41:23.790 --> 03:41:23.800 align:start position:0%
relative to cultivation locations for
 
03:41:28.229 --> 03:41:28.239 align:start position:0%
alternative treatment centers hb31 would
 
03:41:30.510 --> 03:41:30.520 align:start position:0%
be benei would be a beneficial addition
 
03:41:32.870 --> 03:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire's therapeutic program
 
03:41:35.910 --> 03:41:35.920 align:start position:0%
for several reasons first allowing
 
03:41:38.110 --> 03:41:38.120 align:start position:0%
alternative treatment centers which are
 
03:41:41.030 --> 03:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
atc's to operate additional cultivation
 
03:41:44.110 --> 03:41:44.120 align:start position:0%
locations such as green houses addresses
 
03:41:46.670 --> 03:41:46.680 align:start position:0%
the growing demand for therapeutic
 
03:41:49.110 --> 03:41:49.120 align:start position:0%
cannabis uh with more cultivation
 
03:41:51.429 --> 03:41:51.439 align:start position:0%
capacity atc's can increase their
 
03:41:53.229 --> 03:41:53.239 align:start position:0%
production of cannabis ensuring that
 
03:41:55.229 --> 03:41:55.239 align:start position:0%
they have a consistent and sufficient
 
03:41:57.229 --> 03:41:57.239 align:start position:0%
supply of therapeutic cannabis for
 
03:41:59.590 --> 03:41:59.600 align:start position:0%
patients this would be particularly
 
03:42:01.710 --> 03:42:01.720 align:start position:0%
helpful in preventing shortages and
 
03:42:03.790 --> 03:42:03.800 align:start position:0%
ensuring timely access to therapeutic
 
03:42:06.389 --> 03:42:06.399 align:start position:0%
cannabis for qualifying
 
03:42:09.189 --> 03:42:09.199 align:start position:0%
patients moreover the Bill's requirement
 
03:42:11.990 --> 03:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
for input from qualifying patients
 
03:42:13.870 --> 03:42:13.880 align:start position:0%
designated caregivers and local
 
03:42:16.349 --> 03:42:16.359 align:start position:0%
residents before approving additional
 
03:42:18.750 --> 03:42:18.760 align:start position:0%
cultivation locations Fosters
 
03:42:21.710 --> 03:42:21.720 align:start position:0%
transparency and Community involvement
 
03:42:23.510 --> 03:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
by engaging with the local governing
 
03:42:26.269 --> 03:42:26.279 align:start position:0%
body and residents the bill ensures that
 
03:42:28.429 --> 03:42:28.439 align:start position:0%
the expansion of cultivation is done in
 
03:42:31.189 --> 03:42:31.199 align:start position:0%
a way that respects local concerns
 
03:42:34.750 --> 03:42:34.760 align:start position:0%
zoning laws and Community Values this
 
03:42:37.790 --> 03:42:37.800 align:start position:0%
collaborative approach uh promotes trust
 
03:42:40.750 --> 03:42:40.760 align:start position:0%
between the atc's and local communities
 
03:42:42.670 --> 03:42:42.680 align:start position:0%
which can be crucial for the long-term
 
03:42:44.189 --> 03:42:44.199 align:start position:0%
success and acceptance of the
 
03:42:46.550 --> 03:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program
 
03:42:49.349 --> 03:42:49.359 align:start position:0%
Additionally the inclusion of greenhouse
 
03:42:51.710 --> 03:42:51.720 align:start position:0%
green houses as a potential cultivation
 
03:42:53.830 --> 03:42:53.840 align:start position:0%
site offers a more environmentally
 
03:42:56.389 --> 03:42:56.399 align:start position:0%
sustainable option which could lower
 
03:42:58.389 --> 03:42:58.399 align:start position:0%
operational costs and increase
 
03:43:01.429 --> 03:43:01.439 align:start position:0%
production efficiency this sustainable
 
03:43:04.110 --> 03:43:04.120 align:start position:0%
practice aligns with broader goals of
 
03:43:06.269 --> 03:43:06.279 align:start position:0%
reducing environmental impact while

supporting the needs of the
 
03:43:10.910 --> 03:43:10.920 align:start position:0%
program overall this bill helps the New
 
03:43:13.269 --> 03:43:13.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire therapeutic cannabis program
 
03:43:15.389 --> 03:43:15.399 align:start position:0%

03:43:28.750 --> 03:43:28.760 align:start position:0%
maintaining the Integrity of the program
 
03:43:30.550 --> 03:43:30.560 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any
 
03:43:33.590 --> 03:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
questions thank you any
 
03:43:36.670 --> 03:43:36.680 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
03:43:40.870 --> 03:43:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:43.550 --> 03:43:43.560 align:start position:0%
microphone microphone's not
 
03:43:45.710 --> 03:43:45.720 align:start position:0%
on there you go
 
03:43:50.389 --> 03:43:50.399 align:start position:0%
thank you uh I'm a little confused uh it
 
03:43:54.030 --> 03:43:54.040 align:start position:0%
is are we talking about one
 
03:43:58.510 --> 03:43:58.520 align:start position:0%
organization with various parts to it or
 
03:44:00.950 --> 03:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
or several different
 
03:44:04.149 --> 03:44:04.159 align:start position:0%
organizations U you you've you've got an
 
03:44:07.830 --> 03:44:07.840 align:start position:0%
existing facility and then it's
 
03:44:11.269 --> 03:44:11.279 align:start position:0%
expanding so I just wanted to know if
 
03:44:14.229 --> 03:44:14.239 align:start position:0%
that's one organization or several
 
03:44:14.239 --> 03:44:15.670 align:start position:0%
that's one organization or several
different

03:44:15.670 --> 03:44:15.680 align:start position:0%
different
 
03:44:19.269 --> 03:44:19.279 align:start position:0%
organizations um I I believe it's per
 
03:44:24.550 --> 03:44:24.560 align:start position:0%
ATC mhm so so technically we have three
 
03:44:26.550 --> 03:44:26.560 align:start position:0%
companies that run the atcs we have
 
03:44:30.429 --> 03:44:30.439 align:start position:0%
seven seven uh actual physical locations
 
03:44:33.990 --> 03:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
but these um and it would be up to to
 
03:44:38.309 --> 03:44:38.319 align:start position:0%
the uh companies and the um Community
 
03:44:41.030 --> 03:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
where these are located but for example
 
03:44:43.750 --> 03:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
there's the um uh Green Leaf has the
 
03:44:46.510 --> 03:44:46.520 align:start position:0%
grow facility and they might put a a
 
03:44:48.630 --> 03:44:48.640 align:start position:0%
greenhouse outside of that gross
 
03:44:50.790 --> 03:44:50.800 align:start position:0%
facility or in another location but this
 
03:44:54.269 --> 03:44:54.279 align:start position:0%
would be um per company so we've got
 
03:44:56.710 --> 03:44:56.720 align:start position:0%
three companies I think does that answer
 
03:45:00.550 --> 03:45:00.560 align:start position:0%
your question uh not
 
03:45:04.469 --> 03:45:04.479 align:start position:0%
exactly what I'm trying to say is that
 
03:45:06.469 --> 03:45:06.479 align:start position:0%
this starts with one
 
03:45:09.510 --> 03:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
organization and they're allowed to
 
03:45:13.469 --> 03:45:13.479 align:start position:0%
expand is the expansion still part of
 
03:45:16.349 --> 03:45:16.359 align:start position:0%
that organization
 
03:45:20.429 --> 03:45:20.439 align:start position:0%
and is it one board of directors yes yes
 
03:45:23.070 --> 03:45:23.080 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing it from people behind me and
 
03:45:25.590 --> 03:45:25.600 align:start position:0%
that is my belief as well and I'm sure
 
03:45:27.550 --> 03:45:27.560 align:start position:0%
somebody will come up and address that
 
03:45:30.750 --> 03:45:30.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:33.950 --> 03:45:33.960 align:start position:0%
it any other questions you all
 
03:45:37.229 --> 03:45:37.239 align:start position:0%
representative McKay okay um oh
 
03:45:37.239 --> 03:45:39.229 align:start position:0%
representative McKay okay um oh
representative

03:45:39.229 --> 03:45:39.239 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:45:42.309 --> 03:45:42.319 align:start position:0%
McGrath I thank you
 
03:45:45.550 --> 03:45:45.560 align:start position:0%
um so
 
03:45:48.030 --> 03:45:48.040 align:start position:0%
if this I can understand how it could
 
03:45:50.149 --> 03:45:50.159 align:start position:0%
save on energy that's
 
03:45:53.269 --> 03:45:53.279 align:start position:0%
huge make it more affordable meet the
 
03:45:53.279 --> 03:45:54.910 align:start position:0%
huge make it more affordable meet the
growing

03:45:54.910 --> 03:45:54.920 align:start position:0%
growing
 
03:45:58.389 --> 03:45:58.399 align:start position:0%
demand but it has nothing really to do
 
03:46:02.070 --> 03:46:02.080 align:start position:0%
with the patient location so I'm just
 
03:46:04.429 --> 03:46:04.439 align:start position:0%
wondering why soliciting input from
 
03:46:08.550 --> 03:46:08.560 align:start position:0%
patients and caregivers is part of
 
03:46:12.469 --> 03:46:12.479 align:start position:0%
that I I think so you're correct and
 
03:46:15.630 --> 03:46:15.640 align:start position:0%
that it's grown in a the cannabis plants
 
03:46:17.710 --> 03:46:17.720 align:start position:0%
are grown in a facility and and the
 
03:46:19.550 --> 03:46:19.560 align:start position:0%
product is then shipped to the
 
03:46:22.229 --> 03:46:22.239 align:start position:0%
dispensaries so it's not grown at the
 
03:46:25.349 --> 03:46:25.359 align:start position:0%
dispensaries you know so um I I think
 
03:46:27.950 --> 03:46:27.960 align:start position:0%
that including the the patients is just
 
03:46:30.149 --> 03:46:30.159 align:start position:0%
a a good thing to do because they're
 
03:46:33.389 --> 03:46:33.399 align:start position:0%
members of the program and they can give
 
03:46:35.870 --> 03:46:35.880 align:start position:0%
input so I I think that that's the only
 
03:46:37.630 --> 03:46:37.640 align:start position:0%
reason for that just it's good practice
 
03:46:39.550 --> 03:46:39.560 align:start position:0%
to include
 
03:46:42.510 --> 03:46:42.520 align:start position:0%
them other
 
03:46:44.870 --> 03:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
03:46:44.880 --> 03:46:49.630 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
thank

03:46:49.630 --> 03:46:49.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:52.429 --> 03:46:52.439 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is former
 
03:46:58.830 --> 03:46:58.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:00.870 --> 03:47:00.880 align:start position:0%
coner thank you Mr chair and for the
 
03:47:02.269 --> 03:47:02.279 align:start position:0%
record I'm still Jerry kerk and still
 
03:47:03.950 --> 03:47:03.960 align:start position:0%
chair the therapeutic canab medical
 
03:47:08.189 --> 03:47:08.199 align:start position:0%
oversight board um and uh yes we do
 
03:47:10.830 --> 03:47:10.840 align:start position:0%
support this bill even though this in
 
03:47:12.469 --> 03:47:12.479 align:start position:0%
some senses is not a straightforward
 
03:47:14.469 --> 03:47:14.479 align:start position:0%
medical issue it impacts our patients
 
03:47:15.630 --> 03:47:15.640 align:start position:0%
and therefore before we thought we
 
03:47:18.110 --> 03:47:18.120 align:start position:0%
should take a stand on it uh it again
 
03:47:19.790 --> 03:47:19.800 align:start position:0%
would allow additional cultivation
 
03:47:21.750 --> 03:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
locations for atcs including green
 
03:47:24.110 --> 03:47:24.120 align:start position:0%
houses the indoor cultivation as it is
 
03:47:26.269 --> 03:47:26.279 align:start position:0%
currently required as we've said really
 
03:47:27.910 --> 03:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
significantly increases cost because
 
03:47:30.389 --> 03:47:30.399 align:start position:0%
it's indoor lighting uh environmental
 
03:47:32.309 --> 03:47:32.319 align:start position:0%
control all that kind of stuff
 
03:47:33.830 --> 03:47:33.840 align:start position:0%
Greenhouse cultivation we can take
 
03:47:36.070 --> 03:47:36.080 align:start position:0%
advantage of the sun uh which is really
 
03:47:37.710 --> 03:47:37.720 align:start position:0%
very helpful I actually have a
 
03:47:39.590 --> 03:47:39.600 align:start position:0%
greenhouse I've had one for 10 years you
 
03:47:41.070 --> 03:47:41.080 align:start position:0%
know it's been kind of cold lately but
 
03:47:42.790 --> 03:47:42.800 align:start position:0%
last week I was 83 degrees in my
 
03:47:45.309 --> 03:47:45.319 align:start position:0%
Greenhouse in the midday with the Sun so
 
03:47:46.870 --> 03:47:46.880 align:start position:0%
you you can save some money on heating
 
03:47:48.510 --> 03:47:48.520 align:start position:0%
you might have to still heat some during
 
03:47:52.030 --> 03:47:52.040 align:start position:0%
the evening of course um but the there's
 
03:47:53.870 --> 03:47:53.880 align:start position:0%
a lot of cost for the lighting and the
 
03:47:55.630 --> 03:47:55.640 align:start position:0%
environmental controls for indoor
 
03:47:58.309 --> 03:47:58.319 align:start position:0%
growing so the other thing is it's
 
03:47:59.910 --> 03:47:59.920 align:start position:0%
somewhat difficult to completely
 
03:48:01.870 --> 03:48:01.880 align:start position:0%
reproduce the sunlight Spectrum remember
 
03:48:04.149 --> 03:48:04.159 align:start position:0%
plants evolved to be able to work with
 
03:48:06.630 --> 03:48:06.640 align:start position:0%
sunlight not with indoor high-intensity
 
03:48:08.670 --> 03:48:08.680 align:start position:0%
lights and so sometimes it's hard to get
 
03:48:11.110 --> 03:48:11.120 align:start position:0%
their exactly the right spectrum and you
 
03:48:12.830 --> 03:48:12.840 align:start position:0%
can get some cultivars that may not grow
 
03:48:14.870 --> 03:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
as well in an indoor grow facility as
 
03:48:17.550 --> 03:48:17.560 align:start position:0%
they might outside in the U in the
 
03:48:19.750 --> 03:48:19.760 align:start position:0%
sunlight the major problem one of the
 
03:48:21.510 --> 03:48:21.520 align:start position:0%
major problems for our patients is the
 
03:48:23.950 --> 03:48:23.960 align:start position:0%
cost of product and anything that will
 
03:48:25.990 --> 03:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
help lower the cost will make it easier
 
03:48:27.389 --> 03:48:27.399 align:start position:0%
for them we do have some the most
 
03:48:28.790 --> 03:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
expensive product compared to some of
 
03:48:32.389 --> 03:48:32.399 align:start position:0%
our adjacent States um and as has been
 
03:48:35.550 --> 03:48:35.560 align:start position:0%
noted the facilities would be subject
 
03:48:38.910 --> 03:48:38.920 align:start position:0%
all of the same rules for security uh it
 
03:48:41.429 --> 03:48:41.439 align:start position:0%
would just simply be that it would it be
 
03:48:43.990 --> 03:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
could be open to the sky so you can use
 
03:48:44.000 --> 03:48:45.309 align:start position:0%
could be open to the sky so you can use
sunlight

03:48:45.309 --> 03:48:45.319 align:start position:0%
sunlight
 
03:48:47.870 --> 03:48:47.880 align:start position:0%
um the as far as soliciting information
 
03:48:49.349 --> 03:48:49.359 align:start position:0%
from the patients so let's say you're
 
03:48:50.670 --> 03:48:50.680 align:start position:0%
going have a hearing in the town about
 
03:48:51.830 --> 03:48:51.840 align:start position:0%
whether they're going to allow a
 
03:48:53.309 --> 03:48:53.319 align:start position:0%
cultivation facility because that's what
 
03:48:55.510 --> 03:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
this allows this input from the
 
03:48:57.750 --> 03:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
residents of the town uh well they just
 
03:48:59.030 --> 03:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
know that there's going to be a building
 
03:49:00.070 --> 03:49:00.080 align:start position:0%
over there or there's going to be a
 
03:49:02.070 --> 03:49:02.080 align:start position:0%
greenhouse I mean but that's all they
 
03:49:04.269 --> 03:49:04.279 align:start position:0%
know whereas the patients if they are
 
03:49:06.149 --> 03:49:06.159 align:start position:0%
allowed to testify would be able to say
 
03:49:08.910 --> 03:49:08.920 align:start position:0%
why it's an issue U you know like I'm
 
03:49:10.910 --> 03:49:10.920 align:start position:0%
saying to you patients could say the
 
03:49:12.950 --> 03:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
same thing in their town meeting so
 
03:49:14.750 --> 03:49:14.760 align:start position:0%
that's why that's there and they're they
 
03:49:16.429 --> 03:49:16.439 align:start position:0%
basically the end users so they have a
 
03:49:18.910 --> 03:49:18.920 align:start position:0%
vested interest in trying to have a good
 
03:49:21.950 --> 03:49:21.960 align:start position:0%
product which is cheaper um so in
 
03:49:24.790 --> 03:49:24.800 align:start position:0%
essence again TCM o did support this we
 
03:49:27.510 --> 03:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
voted 8 to zero to support this there
 
03:49:29.189 --> 03:49:29.199 align:start position:0%
was one member who abstained that's
 
03:49:30.910 --> 03:49:30.920 align:start position:0%
because he's the representative of an
 
03:49:32.630 --> 03:49:32.640 align:start position:0%
ATC and he felt there was a conflict of
 
03:49:34.469 --> 03:49:34.479 align:start position:0%
interest so he abstained from voting on
 
03:49:37.429 --> 03:49:37.439 align:start position:0%
this um and I think that's basically it
 
03:49:39.189 --> 03:49:39.199 align:start position:0%
but I think the the the issue about the
 
03:49:42.389 --> 03:49:42.399 align:start position:0%
loss of security was really incorrect in
 
03:49:44.110 --> 03:49:44.120 align:start position:0%
and when the when this was vetoed it
 
03:49:45.870 --> 03:49:45.880 align:start position:0%
really does have the same security it's
 
03:49:47.830 --> 03:49:47.840 align:start position:0%
subject to all the same rules that's
 
03:49:49.670 --> 03:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
right here in the statute sorry in the
 
03:49:52.030 --> 03:49:52.040 align:start position:0%
bill and so as a result we think that
 
03:49:53.469 --> 03:49:53.479 align:start position:0%
there's no earthly reason why this
 
03:49:54.910 --> 03:49:54.920 align:start position:0%
should not be allowed to make it better
 
03:49:56.550 --> 03:49:56.560 align:start position:0%
for our patients thank you I'll take
 
03:50:00.990 --> 03:50:01.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:03.389 --> 03:50:03.399 align:start position:0%
questions I'm staying done thank you
 
03:50:03.399 --> 03:50:10.030 align:start position:0%
questions I'm staying done thank you
thank

03:50:10.030 --> 03:50:10.040 align:start position:0%

03:50:14.189 --> 03:50:14.199 align:start position:0%
Holt from the Department of Health and
 
03:50:20.469 --> 03:50:20.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:22.070 --> 03:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
 
03:50:24.189 --> 03:50:24.199 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Michael Holt again
 
03:50:25.550 --> 03:50:25.560 align:start position:0%
I'm the administrator of the therapeutic
 
03:50:26.910 --> 03:50:26.920 align:start position:0%
cannabis program with the Department of
 
03:50:30.670 --> 03:50:30.680 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services um hb31 is a
 
03:50:33.309 --> 03:50:33.319 align:start position:0%
bill that the department supports um for
 
03:50:35.149 --> 03:50:35.159 align:start position:0%
the the reasons already mentioned the
 
03:50:37.790 --> 03:50:37.800 align:start position:0%
bill is intended um intended benefits
 
03:50:39.189 --> 03:50:39.199 align:start position:0%
would be to lower product cost for
 
03:50:41.910 --> 03:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
patients um and increase variety of
 
03:50:44.469 --> 03:50:44.479 align:start position:0%
products to patients and uh in both
 
03:50:46.030 --> 03:50:46.040 align:start position:0%
these these ways P patients would
 
03:50:48.550 --> 03:50:48.560 align:start position:0%
benefit um therapeutically um and in
 
03:50:50.750 --> 03:50:50.760 align:start position:0%
their wallet um the benefits of
 
03:50:52.309 --> 03:50:52.319 align:start position:0%
greenhouse cultivation includes lower
 
03:50:57.389 --> 03:50:57.399 align:start position:0%
production costs um uh due to a lack of
 
03:50:59.750 --> 03:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
Reliance on electricity you can rely on
 
03:51:04.229 --> 03:51:04.239 align:start position:0%
the sun uh also as Mr Dr kerk said um
 
03:51:06.469 --> 03:51:06.479 align:start position:0%
different varieties of cannabis can be
 
03:51:09.269 --> 03:51:09.279 align:start position:0%
grown that respond better to sunlight
 
03:51:13.750 --> 03:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
than uh electric light um I want to
 
03:51:15.269 --> 03:51:15.279 align:start position:0%
focus on the spefic spefic requirements
 
03:51:17.630 --> 03:51:17.640 align:start position:0%
of the bill I mean they include most
 
03:51:21.070 --> 03:51:21.080 align:start position:0%
prominently these facilities must comply
 
03:51:23.590 --> 03:51:23.600 align:start position:0%
with all local zoning laws um when we
 
03:51:25.670 --> 03:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
get to the question of why do we need to
 
03:51:29.550 --> 03:51:29.560 align:start position:0%
solicit public input um this is uh this
 
03:51:31.790 --> 03:51:31.800 align:start position:0%
has been the requirement in the statute
 
03:51:33.870 --> 03:51:33.880 align:start position:0%
for all cult all facilities cannabis
 
03:51:35.750 --> 03:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
facilities you know since the law first
 
03:51:38.670 --> 03:51:38.680 align:start position:0%
passed so this bill is designed to not
 
03:51:40.790 --> 03:51:40.800 align:start position:0%
change any processes where we would the
 
03:51:42.870 --> 03:51:42.880 align:start position:0%
department would work with the local uh
 
03:51:45.030 --> 03:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
town or city where it's proposed to be
 
03:51:46.870 --> 03:51:46.880 align:start position:0%
um have a public hearing invite the
 
03:51:49.189 --> 03:51:49.199 align:start position:0%
public and patients to come speak um so
 
03:51:50.910 --> 03:51:50.920 align:start position:0%
we're trying to you know not shortcut
 
03:51:52.550 --> 03:51:52.560 align:start position:0%
any or the sponsors are not trying to
 
03:51:54.950 --> 03:51:54.960 align:start position:0%
shortcut any um Provisions uh
 
03:51:56.389 --> 03:51:56.399 align:start position:0%
requirements that have already happened
 
03:51:59.550 --> 03:51:59.560 align:start position:0%
with this uh with any cannabis facility
 
03:52:02.349 --> 03:52:02.359 align:start position:0%
um security-wise um there are no
 
03:52:04.269 --> 03:52:04.279 align:start position:0%
security provisions in the bill however
 
03:52:06.149 --> 03:52:06.159 align:start position:0%
there's a reference to our uh the
 
03:52:08.189 --> 03:52:08.199 align:start position:0%
Department's rulemaking Authority that
 
03:52:11.309 --> 03:52:11.319 align:start position:0%
rule making Authority gives us um uh and
 
03:52:14.149 --> 03:52:14.159 align:start position:0%
and requires us to um establish very
 
03:52:17.590 --> 03:52:17.600 align:start position:0%
strict security regulations um on things
 
03:52:20.349 --> 03:52:20.359 align:start position:0%
like uh uh lighting physical security
 
03:52:22.710 --> 03:52:22.720 align:start position:0%
access who can get into the facilities
 
03:52:26.030 --> 03:52:26.040 align:start position:0%
um alarm requirements um Etc the
 
03:52:29.710 --> 03:52:29.720 align:start position:0%
security uh uh in these facilities is
 
03:52:29.720 --> 03:52:31.269 align:start position:0%
security uh uh in these facilities is
robust

03:52:31.269 --> 03:52:31.279 align:start position:0%
robust
 
03:52:33.910 --> 03:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
um and uh that should not be a reason to
 
03:52:37.189 --> 03:52:37.199 align:start position:0%
not allow this you know um as well as in
 
03:52:39.830 --> 03:52:39.840 align:start position:0%
we have rule making on inventory control
 
03:52:41.870 --> 03:52:41.880 align:start position:0%
um and protection against diversion and
 
03:52:43.710 --> 03:52:43.720 align:start position:0%
theft and and whatnot these uh these
 
03:52:45.990 --> 03:52:46.000 align:start position:0%
places would will absolutely be secure
 
03:52:47.950 --> 03:52:47.960 align:start position:0%
um the the Department's regulatory
 
03:52:49.790 --> 03:52:49.800 align:start position:0%
Authority is sufficient to ensure ATC
 
03:52:52.110 --> 03:52:52.120 align:start position:0%
compliance with the laws and the rules
 
03:52:54.030 --> 03:52:54.040 align:start position:0%
and the department can operationalize
 
03:52:56.189 --> 03:52:56.199 align:start position:0%
this bill within our current budget
 
03:52:58.110 --> 03:52:58.120 align:start position:0%
through inspections and uh and and
 
03:52:59.950 --> 03:52:59.960 align:start position:0%
whatnot so again uh the department
 
03:53:02.189 --> 03:53:02.199 align:start position:0%
supports the bill because it benefits
 
03:53:05.070 --> 03:53:05.080 align:start position:0%
patients um and I'm happy to take any
 
03:53:09.510 --> 03:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
questions any questions represented
 
03:53:12.149 --> 03:53:12.159 align:start position:0%
delus thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
03:53:15.110 --> 03:53:15.120 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
03:53:16.950 --> 03:53:16.960 align:start position:0%
green houses come in different sizes are
 
03:53:18.670 --> 03:53:18.680 align:start position:0%
there do you
 
03:53:21.590 --> 03:53:21.600 align:start position:0%
have or are we even do we need to be
 
03:53:25.070 --> 03:53:25.080 align:start position:0%
concerned about number of plants per
 
03:53:28.510 --> 03:53:28.520 align:start position:0%
square foot or how is that determined um
 
03:53:30.790 --> 03:53:30.800 align:start position:0%
the law currently establishes the cap on
 
03:53:33.429 --> 03:53:33.439 align:start position:0%
Plants um none of the atcs have ever
 
03:53:36.030 --> 03:53:36.040 align:start position:0%
reached that cap um like I said in an
 
03:53:38.229 --> 03:53:38.239 align:start position:0%
earlier testimony there's a there's a
 
03:53:42.309 --> 03:53:42.319 align:start position:0%
there's a a um uh a delineated market
 
03:53:44.790 --> 03:53:44.800 align:start position:0%
for this there's no Financial incen for
 
03:53:47.349 --> 03:53:47.359 align:start position:0%
an ATC to grow more cannabis that it can
 
03:53:49.309 --> 03:53:49.319 align:start position:0%
than it can sell um and so because of
 
03:53:51.469 --> 03:53:51.479 align:start position:0%
that the caps in current law um have
 
03:53:54.550 --> 03:53:54.560 align:start position:0%
never been reached um and on top of that
 
03:53:56.750 --> 03:53:56.760 align:start position:0%
we have strict inventory controls uh the
 
03:53:59.389 --> 03:53:59.399 align:start position:0%
department requires um a an electronic
 
03:54:00.910 --> 03:54:00.920 align:start position:0%
inventory system a seed to sale
 
03:54:03.790 --> 03:54:03.800 align:start position:0%
inventory system so every plant um every
 
03:54:07.950 --> 03:54:07.960 align:start position:0%
ounce every fruit chew is is tracked um
 
03:54:11.269 --> 03:54:11.279 align:start position:0%
and uh and accounted for so I think
 
03:54:12.790 --> 03:54:12.800 align:start position:0%
there will be some learning that needs
 
03:54:15.389 --> 03:54:15.399 align:start position:0%
to happen in terms of uh whether or not
 
03:54:17.149 --> 03:54:17.159 align:start position:0%
uh we need additional rules for green
 
03:54:19.469 --> 03:54:19.479 align:start position:0%
houses but that that's work that we're
 
03:54:22.030 --> 03:54:22.040 align:start position:0%
uh the department is able to do um as
 
03:54:25.229 --> 03:54:25.239 align:start position:0%
has been stated um other uh many other
 
03:54:28.590 --> 03:54:28.600 align:start position:0%
states um allow for Greenhouse grows um
 
03:54:30.590 --> 03:54:30.600 align:start position:0%
we'll evaluate our our current RS and
 
03:54:34.229 --> 03:54:34.239 align:start position:0%
update them as needed um and uh I guess
 
03:54:35.389 --> 03:54:35.399 align:start position:0%
I would say one more thing is that this
 
03:54:37.469 --> 03:54:37.479 align:start position:0%
does not this bill does not allow
 
03:54:40.670 --> 03:54:40.680 align:start position:0%
outdoor grows like in fields that can be
 
03:54:45.990 --> 03:54:46.000 align:start position:0%
seen this it still needs to be in a
 
03:54:48.030 --> 03:54:48.040 align:start position:0%
structure representative McGrath did you
 
03:54:51.590 --> 03:54:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:55.469 --> 03:54:55.479 align:start position:0%
up um so people talking about the
 
03:54:58.229 --> 03:54:58.239 align:start position:0%
security of the buildings and this is
 
03:55:02.349 --> 03:55:02.359 align:start position:0%
medical marijuana is there an abuse
 
03:55:04.070 --> 03:55:04.080 align:start position:0%
potential for the plants that are being
 
03:55:09.910 --> 03:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:12.149 --> 03:55:12.159 align:start position:0%
security I'm not sure I'm not sure I
 
03:55:15.309 --> 03:55:15.319 align:start position:0%
know abuse potential right
 
03:55:17.790 --> 03:55:17.800 align:start position:0%
um do you mean a theft potential right
 
03:55:19.750 --> 03:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
so if they steal it and they get high
 
03:55:22.630 --> 03:55:22.640 align:start position:0%
off it is it is there an abuse potential
 
03:55:26.030 --> 03:55:26.040 align:start position:0%
for the what's being grown in there um
 
03:55:28.630 --> 03:55:28.640 align:start position:0%
cannabis if if if cannabis has THC it
 
03:55:31.469 --> 03:55:31.479 align:start position:0%
does produce um Euphoria it's
 
03:55:34.269 --> 03:55:34.279 align:start position:0%
intoxicating and so I believe the
 
03:55:36.630 --> 03:55:36.640 align:start position:0%
reasons for such strict security
 
03:55:38.510 --> 03:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
measures when the program was first
 
03:55:42.030 --> 03:55:42.040 align:start position:0%
established in 2013 was to uh prevent
 
03:55:46.630 --> 03:55:46.640 align:start position:0%
diversion and theft um and so the same
 
03:55:50.510 --> 03:55:50.520 align:start position:0%
security protocols um have you know have
 
03:55:53.309 --> 03:55:53.319 align:start position:0%
have been in place since 2013 obviously
 
03:55:58.110 --> 03:55:58.120 align:start position:0%
now with the surrounding states allowing
 
03:56:01.110 --> 03:56:01.120 align:start position:0%
citizens over 21 to grow their own
 
03:56:04.550 --> 03:56:04.560 align:start position:0%
cannabis the risk of diversion and theft
 
03:56:07.189 --> 03:56:07.199 align:start position:0%
is much lower you know in in a regional
 
03:56:09.309 --> 03:56:09.319 align:start position:0%
sense so perhaps the the security
 
03:56:11.950 --> 03:56:11.960 align:start position:0%
requirements that we have in place um
 
03:56:14.070 --> 03:56:14.080 align:start position:0%
are you know we are too strict um I'm
 
03:56:16.110 --> 03:56:16.120 align:start position:0%
not going to say that now but uh we are
 
03:56:18.229 --> 03:56:18.239 align:start position:0%
not proposing to reduce any of the
 
03:56:19.670 --> 03:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
security requirements that we have in
 
03:56:22.309 --> 03:56:22.319 align:start position:0%
place um without fully vetting those
 
03:56:24.550 --> 03:56:24.560 align:start position:0%
changes through Ru
 
03:56:28.189 --> 03:56:28.199 align:start position:0%
making does that does that help thank
 
03:56:31.349 --> 03:56:31.359 align:start position:0%
you other question yes represented
 
03:56:35.670 --> 03:56:35.680 align:start position:0%
Lucas um with regard to security how
 
03:56:37.830 --> 03:56:37.840 align:start position:0%
does the shipment between the green
 
03:56:39.469 --> 03:56:39.479 align:start position:0%
houses and the
 
03:56:42.389 --> 03:56:42.399 align:start position:0%
ATC how does that work
 
03:56:44.429 --> 03:56:44.439 align:start position:0%
out we have a section of rules on
 
03:56:49.110 --> 03:56:49.120 align:start position:0%
transport of cannabis um uh locked boxes
 
03:56:52.790 --> 03:56:52.800 align:start position:0%
to ATC staff unmarked vehicles um
 
03:56:56.269 --> 03:56:56.279 align:start position:0%
transport manifests um the sending
 
03:56:58.149 --> 03:56:58.159 align:start position:0%
entity needs to communicate with the
 
03:57:00.030 --> 03:57:00.040 align:start position:0%
receiving entity before a shipment is
 
03:57:04.309 --> 03:57:04.319 align:start position:0%
taken place etc etc it's uh We've uh
 
03:57:06.790 --> 03:57:06.800 align:start position:0%
honestly we've yes we've never had a in
 
03:57:07.910 --> 03:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
the eight years we've been doing this
 
03:57:11.910 --> 03:57:11.920 align:start position:0%
we've never had an issue with uh um a
 
03:57:15.630 --> 03:57:15.640 align:start position:0%
transport other questions
 
03:57:23.469 --> 03:57:23.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:26.870 --> 03:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
much also signed up to speak is Sue Homa
 
03:57:34.070 --> 03:57:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:36.790 --> 03:57:36.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you for the record Sam
 
03:57:40.269 --> 03:57:40.279 align:start position:0%
uh Sue hola from Sam New Hampshire uh
 
03:57:42.870 --> 03:57:42.880 align:start position:0%
there are some we're here to oppose this
 
03:57:44.990 --> 03:57:45.000 align:start position:0%
bill uh there's some concerns about the
 
03:57:47.670 --> 03:57:47.680 align:start position:0%
language in the language it states that
 
03:57:49.550 --> 03:57:49.560 align:start position:0%
green houses may be considered we just
 
03:57:51.870 --> 03:57:51.880 align:start position:0%
heard Mr Holt state that there wouldn't
 
03:57:55.149 --> 03:57:55.159 align:start position:0%
be outdoor growing um I'm not sure what
 
03:57:57.070 --> 03:57:57.080 align:start position:0%
that means what that looks like it looks
 
03:57:59.030 --> 03:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
like the language itself isn't specific
 
03:58:01.670 --> 03:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
enough to to describe what type of
 
03:58:03.309 --> 03:58:03.319 align:start position:0%
growing that we'd be authorizing with
 
03:58:06.030 --> 03:58:06.040 align:start position:0%
this bill um one of the the one of the
 
03:58:08.229 --> 03:58:08.239 align:start position:0%
things that I have a concern with is
 
03:58:11.229 --> 03:58:11.239 align:start position:0%
well is that as these as these rules get
 
03:58:12.910 --> 03:58:12.920 align:start position:0%
looser and we expand the medical
 
03:58:14.670 --> 03:58:14.680 align:start position:0%
marijuana program
 
03:58:17.030 --> 03:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
um it opens us up to more things like if
 
03:58:19.990 --> 03:58:20.000 align:start position:0%
we start doing more outdoor type of grow
 
03:58:22.670 --> 03:58:22.680 align:start position:0%
or Greenhouse grow um Maine's having
 
03:58:24.670 --> 03:58:24.680 align:start position:0%
quite an issue with this Maine has quite
 
03:58:26.429 --> 03:58:26.439 align:start position:0%
lack rules and I know that
 
03:58:27.710 --> 03:58:27.720 align:start position:0%
representative McGrath had some
 
03:58:30.830 --> 03:58:30.840 align:start position:0%
questions about the security aspect um
 
03:58:32.469 --> 03:58:32.479 align:start position:0%
even with Main's rules even with the
 
03:58:34.469 --> 03:58:34.479 align:start position:0%
fact that they have proliferated on
 
03:58:36.469 --> 03:58:36.479 align:start position:0%
their state laws on what they can do for
 
03:58:38.630 --> 03:58:38.640 align:start position:0%
marijuana medically and for
 
03:58:42.229 --> 03:58:42.239 align:start position:0%
recreationally still hasn't stopped 200
 
03:58:45.590 --> 03:58:45.600 align:start position:0%
illegal you know Chinese
 
03:58:48.790 --> 03:58:48.800 align:start position:0%
um pot cartels from flooding their state
 
03:58:51.910 --> 03:58:51.920 align:start position:0%
and ingratiating themselves in whenever
 
03:58:53.670 --> 03:58:53.680 align:start position:0%
you start having more locations for
 
03:58:55.469 --> 03:58:55.479 align:start position:0%
growing you're giving yourself more
 
03:58:58.590 --> 03:58:58.600 align:start position:0%
exposure uh for that type of activity
 
03:59:00.349 --> 03:59:00.359 align:start position:0%
another one of the things that I heard
 
03:59:02.510 --> 03:59:02.520 align:start position:0%
um stay already was we're trying to
 
03:59:05.590 --> 03:59:05.600 align:start position:0%
agress address the growing demand and as
 
03:59:08.990 --> 03:59:09.000 align:start position:0%
we discussed earlier um one of the
 
03:59:10.670 --> 03:59:10.680 align:start position:0%
concerns I have with the whole slate of
 
03:59:12.550 --> 03:59:12.560 align:start position:0%
bills in this Committee in criminal
 
03:59:14.870 --> 03:59:14.880 align:start position:0%
justice is that there is a NeverEnding
 
03:59:18.149 --> 03:59:18.159 align:start position:0%
Onslaught to expand expand expand let's
 
03:59:20.389 --> 03:59:20.399 align:start position:0%
be clear this is a schedule one
 
03:59:23.070 --> 03:59:23.080 align:start position:0%
federally legal drug when we started
 
03:59:25.149 --> 03:59:25.159 align:start position:0%
this medical marijuana program we did it
 
03:59:27.149 --> 03:59:27.159 align:start position:0%
under the guise of providing
 
03:59:30.070 --> 03:59:30.080 align:start position:0%
Compassionate Care but it gets very
 
03:59:31.790 --> 03:59:31.800 align:start position:0%
clear that Compassionate Care isn't
 
03:59:34.149 --> 03:59:34.159 align:start position:0%
really the goal it's using Compassionate
 
03:59:36.149 --> 03:59:36.159 align:start position:0%
Care to keep expanding the program from
 
03:59:38.750 --> 03:59:38.760 align:start position:0%
where from what it appears to me um one
 
03:59:40.510 --> 03:59:40.520 align:start position:0%
of the things that I have a concern with
 
03:59:42.550 --> 03:59:42.560 align:start position:0%
is that you know it's an it's an open
 
03:59:44.110 --> 03:59:44.120 align:start position:0%
effort this year by one of the leading
 
03:59:45.670 --> 03:59:45.680 align:start position:0%
PR marijuana associations in New
 
03:59:47.389 --> 03:59:47.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they're they're openly
 
03:59:48.990 --> 03:59:49.000 align:start position:0%
discussing about their goal this year is
 
03:59:50.790 --> 03:59:50.800 align:start position:0%
to expand the enrollment of the medical
 
03:59:54.110 --> 03:59:54.120 align:start position:0%
marijuana program and we heard Mr kerk
 
03:59:56.710 --> 03:59:56.720 align:start position:0%
Dr kerk pardon me um was talking about
 
03:59:59.510 --> 03:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
how in this bill language that there's a
 
04:00:01.389 --> 04:00:01.399 align:start position:0%
a little bit in there for patients to be
 
04:00:04.189 --> 04:00:04.199 align:start position:0%
notified and really it's so they can be
 
04:00:06.030 --> 04:00:06.040 align:start position:0%
leveraged to go to their towns and
 
04:00:10.189 --> 04:00:10.199 align:start position:0%
advocate for for this but this the
 
04:00:13.950 --> 04:00:13.960 align:start position:0%
concern I have is if the goal is always
 
04:00:16.710 --> 04:00:16.720 align:start position:0%
to increase users and the legislative
 
04:00:18.590 --> 04:00:18.600 align:start position:0%
calendar is flooded with bills to expand
 
04:00:21.269 --> 04:00:21.279 align:start position:0%
the uh the ATC Market production then
 
04:00:23.389 --> 04:00:23.399 align:start position:0%
the ultimate goal of this program the
 
04:00:25.590 --> 04:00:25.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire medical marijuana program
 
04:00:27.269 --> 04:00:27.279 align:start position:0%
is not to provide a safe alternative
 
04:00:29.070 --> 04:00:29.080 align:start position:0%
resource for individuals experiencing
 
04:00:32.030 --> 04:00:32.040 align:start position:0%
medical conditions it's just to make
 
04:00:34.590 --> 04:00:34.600 align:start position:0%
users to make more people who are using
 
04:00:37.030 --> 04:00:37.040 align:start position:0%
the product
 
04:00:40.229 --> 04:00:40.239 align:start position:0%
um how is that different than big Pharma
 
04:00:41.950 --> 04:00:41.960 align:start position:0%
if we have to actually advertise
 
04:00:44.269 --> 04:00:44.279 align:start position:0%
patients we have to tell people and AD
 
04:00:45.870 --> 04:00:45.880 align:start position:0%
educate them about the marij medical
 
04:00:47.349 --> 04:00:47.359 align:start position:0%
marijuana program in case it might be
 
04:00:49.550 --> 04:00:49.560 align:start position:0%
useful to them and we have to use the
 
04:00:52.229 --> 04:00:52.239 align:start position:0%
patients to Lobby towns so that they can
 
04:00:52.239 --> 04:00:53.309 align:start position:0%
patients to Lobby towns so that they can
help

04:00:53.309 --> 04:00:53.319 align:start position:0%
help
 
04:00:55.870 --> 04:00:55.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities um cheerlead for these
 
04:00:58.269 --> 04:00:58.279 align:start position:0%
efforts how exactly is this any
 
04:01:00.950 --> 04:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
different than the same reasons that
 
04:01:03.110 --> 04:01:03.120 align:start position:0%
drug reps were giving of why they push
 
04:01:06.510 --> 04:01:06.520 align:start position:0%
oxycoton it is a federally legal drug I
 
04:01:09.349 --> 04:01:09.359 align:start position:0%
think that we have long forgotten why we
 
04:01:11.750 --> 04:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
established this problem yes sir long
 
04:01:13.349 --> 04:01:13.359 align:start position:0%
forgotten why we've established this
 
04:01:15.510 --> 04:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
program but we've established this
 
04:01:17.349 --> 04:01:17.359 align:start position:0%
program and ever since this program is
 
04:01:19.309 --> 04:01:19.319 align:start position:0%
established it immediately tries to get
 
04:01:22.389 --> 04:01:22.399 align:start position:0%
expanded and it just is very concerning
 
04:01:24.349 --> 04:01:24.359 align:start position:0%
from a drug prevention standpoint thank
 
04:01:26.750 --> 04:01:26.760 align:start position:0%
you thank you any
 
04:01:31.990 --> 04:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:35.229 --> 04:01:35.239 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Mike mlin
 
04:01:41.309 --> 04:01:41.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:43.950 --> 04:01:43.960 align:start position:0%
ATC and if you could you've asked before
 
04:01:45.110 --> 04:01:45.120 align:start position:0%
minutes sir if you could keep it closer
 
04:01:46.870 --> 04:01:46.880 align:start position:0%
to three that'd be great good afternoon
 
04:01:48.110 --> 04:01:48.120 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and members of the committee
 
04:01:49.469 --> 04:01:49.479 align:start position:0%
my name is Michael mlof I'm a lawyer and
 
04:01:51.550 --> 04:01:51.560 align:start position:0%
lobbyist in con I represent Sanctuary
 
04:01:53.870 --> 04:01:53.880 align:start position:0%
ATC first point I would like to make out
 
04:01:55.990 --> 04:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
this legislation authorizes nothing this
 
04:01:58.309 --> 04:01:58.319 align:start position:0%
is enabling legislation which provides
 
04:01:59.550 --> 04:01:59.560 align:start position:0%
the authority to the Department of
 
04:02:01.389 --> 04:02:01.399 align:start position:0%
Health Human Services to do what they've
 
04:02:03.309 --> 04:02:03.319 align:start position:0%
been doing for the last 13 years which
 
04:02:06.229 --> 04:02:06.239 align:start position:0%
is Rule and regulate the therapeutic
 
04:02:07.950 --> 04:02:07.960 align:start position:0%
cannabis program so we're not
 
04:02:09.710 --> 04:02:09.720 align:start position:0%
authorizing anything by this bill but
 
04:02:13.030 --> 04:02:13.040 align:start position:0%
we're saying with this bill the HHS TCP
 
04:02:15.309 --> 04:02:15.319 align:start position:0%
has been able to on a absolutely
 
04:02:18.229 --> 04:02:18.239 align:start position:0%
scandal-free program there's been no um
 
04:02:21.070 --> 04:02:21.080 align:start position:0%
issues on manufacturer distribution or
 
04:02:24.550 --> 04:02:24.560 align:start position:0%
retail since this program began every
 
04:02:27.189 --> 04:02:27.199 align:start position:0%
year uh in the last decade the HHS has
 
04:02:30.269 --> 04:02:30.279 align:start position:0%
done a survey of the Cannabis patients
 
04:02:31.790 --> 04:02:31.800 align:start position:0%
therapeutic Canabis patients in the
 
04:02:35.309 --> 04:02:35.319 align:start position:0%
state and the number one issue is cost
 
04:02:36.990 --> 04:02:37.000 align:start position:0%
and the cost is impacted by several
 
04:02:38.870 --> 04:02:38.880 align:start position:0%
factors of number one being production
 
04:02:42.469 --> 04:02:42.479 align:start position:0%
of product uh the price that is charged
 
04:02:44.189 --> 04:02:44.199 align:start position:0%
the patients today is a result of
 
04:02:45.910 --> 04:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
several factors one which we visit later
 
04:02:48.309 --> 04:02:48.319 align:start position:0%
this afternoon but the ability to
 
04:02:50.830 --> 04:02:50.840 align:start position:0%
produce product there are say atcs in
 
04:02:52.149 --> 04:02:52.159 align:start position:0%
the state that literally have to buy
 
04:02:53.950 --> 04:02:53.960 align:start position:0%
product from other ATC cultivation
 
04:02:55.229 --> 04:02:55.239 align:start position:0%
centers because they can't produce
 
04:02:57.229 --> 04:02:57.239 align:start position:0%
enough themselves so when you look at
 
04:02:59.110 --> 04:02:59.120 align:start position:0%
this bill the question is do you trust
 
04:03:01.429 --> 04:03:01.439 align:start position:0%
ATS to do what done for the last decade
 
04:03:03.229 --> 04:03:03.239 align:start position:0%
which is regulate a program that has
 
04:03:05.750 --> 04:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
been very successful there was testimony
 
04:03:07.110 --> 04:03:07.120 align:start position:0%
moments ago about this being some
 
04:03:09.830 --> 04:03:09.840 align:start position:0%
nefarious plot to create a marijuana
 
04:03:11.990 --> 04:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
culture in the state what that ignores
 
04:03:15.030 --> 04:03:15.040 align:start position:0%
is that every ch in this program has to
 
04:03:17.189 --> 04:03:17.199 align:start position:0%
include other people who are suffering
 
04:03:18.830 --> 04:03:18.840 align:start position:0%
from conditions that they can't get
 
04:03:21.630 --> 04:03:21.640 align:start position:0%
relief from from natural other types of
 
04:03:24.309 --> 04:03:24.319 align:start position:0%
therapies so to allude to the fact that
 
04:03:25.870 --> 04:03:25.880 align:start position:0%
don't give this program any more
 
04:03:27.349 --> 04:03:27.359 align:start position:0%
expansion is to say to people who are
 
04:03:29.870 --> 04:03:29.880 align:start position:0%
suffering uh you can suffer in silence
 
04:03:32.110 --> 04:03:32.120 align:start position:0%
but again this is enabling legislation
 
04:03:34.030 --> 04:03:34.040 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with author with
 
04:03:35.910 --> 04:03:35.920 align:start position:0%
authorizing nothing if there's going to
 
04:03:37.349 --> 04:03:37.359 align:start position:0%
be additional cultivation centers
 
04:03:39.110 --> 04:03:39.120 align:start position:0%
they're going to the rigorous approval
 
04:03:42.030 --> 04:03:42.040 align:start position:0%
of the HHS and believe me the approval
 
04:03:45.910 --> 04:03:45.920 align:start position:0%
is incredibly um uh detailed and strict
 
04:03:47.950 --> 04:03:47.960 align:start position:0%
so when you look at this bill I don't
 
04:03:48.830 --> 04:03:48.840 align:start position:0%
think you should think of it's
 
04:03:50.910 --> 04:03:50.920 align:start position:0%
authorizing but enabling and Trust
 
04:03:52.550 --> 04:03:52.560 align:start position:0%
Michael Holt and his Department to put
 
04:03:53.990 --> 04:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
together what they've already done which
 
04:03:55.670 --> 04:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
is a very successful therapeutic
 
04:03:58.510 --> 04:03:58.520 align:start position:0%
cannabis program which is helping over
 
04:04:00.990 --> 04:04:01.000 align:start position:0%
13,000 people in this state I thank you
 
04:04:04.750 --> 04:04:04.760 align:start position:0%
for your time thank you very much any
 
04:04:14.189 --> 04:04:14.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:16.309 --> 04:04:16.319 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is Matt Simon
 
04:04:27.790 --> 04:04:27.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:30.429 --> 04:04:30.439 align:start position:0%
cannabis thank you again Mr chairman
 
04:04:33.590 --> 04:04:33.600 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Matt Simon Granite Leaf
 
04:04:36.389 --> 04:04:36.399 align:start position:0%
cannabis uh we do support
 
04:04:39.030 --> 04:04:39.040 align:start position:0%
hb31 we supported at last session we're
 
04:04:42.229 --> 04:04:42.239 align:start position:0%
very disappointed when it was vetoed uh
 
04:04:43.830 --> 04:04:43.840 align:start position:0%
for all the reasons that have you've
 
04:04:47.990 --> 04:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
heard from Mr Hol and Dr kerk uh any new
 
04:04:50.510 --> 04:04:50.520 align:start position:0%
cultivation location would be subject to
 
04:04:53.070 --> 04:04:53.080 align:start position:0%
all the same rules and requirements that
 
04:04:55.429 --> 04:04:55.439 align:start position:0%
are applied to current cultivation
 
04:04:58.110 --> 04:04:58.120 align:start position:0%
locations these are spelled out in great
 
04:05:00.309 --> 04:05:00.319 align:start position:0%
length in our rules they include things
 
04:05:02.590 --> 04:05:02.600 align:start position:0%
like having a camera pointed anywhere
 
04:05:05.389 --> 04:05:05.399 align:start position:0%
that cannabis might be present and
 
04:05:08.469 --> 04:05:08.479 align:start position:0%
maintaining video archives going back a
 
04:05:11.070 --> 04:05:11.080 align:start position:0%
certain number of hours or days it is
 
04:05:14.550 --> 04:05:14.560 align:start position:0%
very robust and all of those rules would
 
04:05:17.389 --> 04:05:17.399 align:start position:0%
apply to any cultivation location that's
 
04:05:21.110 --> 04:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
licensed under this program so the main
 
04:05:23.269 --> 04:05:23.279 align:start position:0%
reason for the bill basically this bill
 
04:05:25.070 --> 04:05:25.080 align:start position:0%
came about because I was talking to some
 
04:05:27.030 --> 04:05:27.040 align:start position:0%
of our staff members and they said man
 
04:05:28.630 --> 04:05:28.640 align:start position:0%
it would be great if we could grow some
 
04:05:31.110 --> 04:05:31.120 align:start position:0%
of our cannabis in a greenhouse we could
 
04:05:33.750 --> 04:05:33.760 align:start position:0%
put it over there over there is a
 
04:05:35.429 --> 04:05:35.439 align:start position:0%
different address so it would have to be
 
04:05:38.070 --> 04:05:38.080 align:start position:0%
a different cultivation location so we
 
04:05:40.269 --> 04:05:40.279 align:start position:0%
would have to have Department approval
 
04:05:43.189 --> 04:05:43.199 align:start position:0%
and the goal was not to grow more
 
04:05:43.199 --> 04:05:44.349 align:start position:0%
and the goal was not to grow more
cannabis

04:05:44.349 --> 04:05:44.359 align:start position:0%
cannabis
 
04:05:47.070 --> 04:05:47.080 align:start position:0%
okay we've hosted a few tours for for
 
04:05:49.349 --> 04:05:49.359 align:start position:0%
legislators and one of the rooms we
 
04:05:52.349 --> 04:05:52.359 align:start position:0%
always show them is a huge empty room of
 
04:05:54.750 --> 04:05:54.760 align:start position:0%
nothing the huge empty room of nothing
 
04:05:56.590 --> 04:05:56.600 align:start position:0%
is space that we have available to
 
04:05:59.309 --> 04:05:59.319 align:start position:0%
expand into if there was demand we could
 
04:06:01.750 --> 04:06:01.760 align:start position:0%
already expand into that space and grow
 
04:06:05.030 --> 04:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
more under the lights in the indoor
 
04:06:07.189 --> 04:06:07.199 align:start position:0%
facility what we want to be able to do
 
04:06:09.389 --> 04:06:09.399 align:start position:0%
is grow some of our cannabis differently
 
04:06:10.750 --> 04:06:10.760 align:start position:0%
than the Cannabis we're currently
 
04:06:13.590 --> 04:06:13.600 align:start position:0%
growing a it would be less expensive
 
04:06:15.870 --> 04:06:15.880 align:start position:0%
you've already heard B it would be
 
04:06:17.870 --> 04:06:17.880 align:start position:0%
create a broader range of products
 
04:06:20.229 --> 04:06:20.239 align:start position:0%
because cannabis grown Outdoors is
 
04:06:23.510 --> 04:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
subject to pests and sunlight and
 
04:06:25.830 --> 04:06:25.840 align:start position:0%
stressors that actually make the plant
 
04:06:28.189 --> 04:06:28.199 align:start position:0%
grow somewhat differently there are some
 
04:06:30.229 --> 04:06:30.239 align:start position:0%
pros associated with that some cons
 
04:06:33.389 --> 04:06:33.399 align:start position:0%
associated with that any of the cons get
 
04:06:35.269 --> 04:06:35.279 align:start position:0%
addressed through independent lab
 
04:06:37.229 --> 04:06:37.239 align:start position:0%
testing everything we produced outside
 
04:06:41.750 --> 04:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
would have to be lab tested finally our
 
04:06:43.710 --> 04:06:43.720 align:start position:0%
production staff in particular they work
 
04:06:45.750 --> 04:06:45.760 align:start position:0%
plants all the time a lot of them feel
 
04:06:47.790 --> 04:06:47.800 align:start position:0%
strongly about the environment and
 
04:06:49.790 --> 04:06:49.800 align:start position:0%
wanting to reduce our carbon footprint
 
04:06:52.510 --> 04:06:52.520 align:start position:0%
and growing Outdoors would achieve that
 
04:06:54.990 --> 04:06:55.000 align:start position:0%
as well we're not trying to grow more
 
04:06:57.189 --> 04:06:57.199 align:start position:0%
we're trying to serve our PA patients
 
04:06:59.670 --> 04:06:59.680 align:start position:0%
better and operate more efficiently and
 
04:07:02.030 --> 04:07:02.040 align:start position:0%
bring down costs which continues to be
 
04:07:04.269 --> 04:07:04.279 align:start position:0%
the number one
 
04:07:06.910 --> 04:07:06.920 align:start position:0%
concern happy to conclude there any
 
04:07:08.870 --> 04:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
questions any question yes
 
04:07:08.880 --> 04:07:11.229 align:start position:0%
questions any question yes
representative

04:07:11.229 --> 04:07:11.239 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:07:14.630 --> 04:07:14.640 align:start position:0%
Weber so I was thank you for taking my
 
04:07:18.149 --> 04:07:18.159 align:start position:0%
question and thank you Mr chairman um
 
04:07:20.070 --> 04:07:20.080 align:start position:0%
when you say
 
04:07:23.790 --> 04:07:23.800 align:start position:0%
Outdoors does this bill permit
 
04:07:27.149 --> 04:07:27.159 align:start position:0%
cultivation both in an outside space and
 
04:07:29.710 --> 04:07:29.720 align:start position:0%
in a greenhouse space or just or are you
 
04:07:32.630 --> 04:07:32.640 align:start position:0%
using Outdoors as a euphemism for
 
04:07:34.950 --> 04:07:34.960 align:start position:0%
Greenhouse now this bill would only
 
04:07:38.670 --> 04:07:38.680 align:start position:0%
authorize uh cultivation in an enclosed
 
04:07:40.790 --> 04:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
locked facility that could be a
 
04:07:42.990 --> 04:07:43.000 align:start position:0%
greenhouse under this bill we thought
 
04:07:45.189 --> 04:07:45.199 align:start position:0%
about asking for outdoor cultivation
 
04:07:47.030 --> 04:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
which is legal in neighboring states and
 
04:07:49.469 --> 04:07:49.479 align:start position:0%
nobody has an issue with that that I've
 
04:07:51.189 --> 04:07:51.199 align:start position:0%
ever heard their their outdoor
 
04:07:53.309 --> 04:07:53.319 align:start position:0%
cultivation is strictly regulated as
 
04:07:55.429 --> 04:07:55.439 align:start position:0%
well and could theoretically be here as
 
04:07:57.870 --> 04:07:57.880 align:start position:0%
well but since every single bill that
 
04:08:00.550 --> 04:08:00.560 align:start position:0%
gets put in gets treated with so much
 
04:08:02.830 --> 04:08:02.840 align:start position:0%
scrutiny and is treated as a massive
 
04:08:05.229 --> 04:08:05.239 align:start position:0%
expansion of the program just to put
 
04:08:07.229 --> 04:08:07.239 align:start position:0%
that in context uh my understanding is
 
04:08:08.510 --> 04:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire actually has the
 
04:08:12.670 --> 04:08:12.680 align:start position:0%
lowest per capita patient participation
 
04:08:15.030 --> 04:08:15.040 align:start position:0%
of any state that has a therapeutic
 
04:08:17.630 --> 04:08:17.640 align:start position:0%
cannabis program with the exception of
 
04:08:19.269 --> 04:08:19.279 align:start position:0%
states that have gone to adult use when
 
04:08:21.550 --> 04:08:21.560 align:start position:0%
states legalize adult use patient
 
04:08:23.349 --> 04:08:23.359 align:start position:0%
numbers drop but of states that are
 
04:08:25.670 --> 04:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
medical cannabis only we have the lowest
 
04:08:28.309 --> 04:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
per capita patient count so if that's
 
04:08:29.710 --> 04:08:29.720 align:start position:0%
all we've been trying to do year after
 
04:08:31.550 --> 04:08:31.560 align:start position:0%
year with SLO the bills to expand the
 
04:08:33.109 --> 04:08:33.119 align:start position:0%
program we've improved some things on
 
04:08:35.990 --> 04:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
paper but this is still a very small and
 
04:08:38.309 --> 04:08:38.319 align:start position:0%
very tightly regulated program and it
 
04:08:40.990 --> 04:08:41.000 align:start position:0%
would remain so if this passes and may I
 
04:08:44.109 --> 04:08:44.119 align:start position:0%
have a FL please and because I was one
 
04:08:46.030 --> 04:08:46.040 align:start position:0%
of the legislators who did get to
 
04:08:48.590 --> 04:08:48.600 align:start position:0%
observe your facility in Peterboro would
 
04:08:51.149 --> 04:08:51.159 align:start position:0%
you detail for those who have not what
 
04:08:54.590 --> 04:08:54.600 align:start position:0%
your security procedures are there both
 
04:08:57.349 --> 04:08:57.359 align:start position:0%
for your employees entering and leaving
 
04:09:00.950 --> 04:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
the facility and for visitors who want
 
04:09:03.229 --> 04:09:03.239 align:start position:0%
to visit the facility just so we know
 
04:09:05.750 --> 04:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
what they are yeah I think that's thank
 
04:09:06.830 --> 04:09:06.840 align:start position:0%
you for the question it's it would be
 
04:09:08.550 --> 04:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
hard for me to detail them all because I
 
04:09:11.149 --> 04:09:11.159 align:start position:0%
myself get confused checking into our
 
04:09:12.630 --> 04:09:12.640 align:start position:0%
facility sometime you feel like you're
 
04:09:15.030 --> 04:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
walking into Fort Ox uh some people joke
 
04:09:16.950 --> 04:09:16.960 align:start position:0%
that we're regulating cannabis like
 
04:09:19.630 --> 04:09:19.640 align:start position:0%
plutonium and and it does feel that way
 
04:09:22.469 --> 04:09:22.479 align:start position:0%
sometimes uh but to get in the building
 
04:09:25.510 --> 04:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
uh for staff have have to fob in we
 
04:09:27.229 --> 04:09:27.239 align:start position:0%
always have to have two employees in the
 
04:09:29.469 --> 04:09:29.479 align:start position:0%
facility at any given time so two people
 
04:09:31.109 --> 04:09:31.119 align:start position:0%
have to show up and two people have to
 
04:09:34.550 --> 04:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
check out everybody has to sign in date
 
04:09:36.830 --> 04:09:36.840 align:start position:0%
and time and then to get into the area
 
04:09:38.429 --> 04:09:38.439 align:start position:0%
where the plants are that's a whole
 
04:09:41.550 --> 04:09:41.560 align:start position:0%
another set of security people have to
 
04:09:44.389 --> 04:09:44.399 align:start position:0%
put put on protective equipment
 
04:09:47.269 --> 04:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
and there there there fobs on all of the
 
04:09:49.550 --> 04:09:49.560 align:start position:0%
doors like and there are cameras
 
04:09:52.590 --> 04:09:52.600 align:start position:0%
everywhere so if if DHHS wanted
 
04:09:55.149 --> 04:09:55.159 align:start position:0%
to in great detail find out what we're
 
04:09:59.269 --> 04:09:59.279 align:start position:0%
doing at 10:27 on Tuesday October 13th
 
04:10:01.469 --> 04:10:01.479 align:start position:0%
they have a tremendous ability to do
 
04:10:04.550 --> 04:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
that that I think is in excess of the
 
04:10:06.790 --> 04:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
security measures you'd find probably at
 
04:10:11.070 --> 04:10:11.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:13.950 --> 04:10:13.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you any anyone else any
 
04:10:13.960 --> 04:10:15.590 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you any anyone else any
other

04:10:15.590 --> 04:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
other
 
04:10:24.109 --> 04:10:24.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:26.710 --> 04:10:26.720 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Bill
 
04:10:36.309 --> 04:10:36.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:38.389 --> 04:10:38.399 align:start position:0%
Police name is Bill you could put the
 
04:10:40.790 --> 04:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
microphone on
 
04:10:42.950 --> 04:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
please uh as stated my name is Bill
 
04:10:44.710 --> 04:10:44.720 align:start position:0%
bright I'm a major with the New
 
04:10:46.189 --> 04:10:46.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State Police I oversee our
 
04:10:48.670 --> 04:10:48.680 align:start position:0%
Investigative Services Bureau um I've
 
04:10:51.590 --> 04:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
been assigned this bill um and it
 
04:10:53.590 --> 04:10:53.600 align:start position:0%
looking at it from a law enforcement uh
 
04:10:55.670 --> 04:10:55.680 align:start position:0%
perspective the thing that I look for
 
04:10:58.469 --> 04:10:58.479 align:start position:0%
are ways that uh you know a new law
 
04:11:00.590 --> 04:11:00.600 align:start position:0%
could be exploited um and one of the
 
04:11:02.510 --> 04:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
things that I that I don't see in this
 
04:11:05.389 --> 04:11:05.399 align:start position:0%
bill is that uh that this would be
 
04:11:08.429 --> 04:11:08.439 align:start position:0%
limited to New Hampshire um alternative
 
04:11:11.990 --> 04:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
treatment uh facilities I don't know uh
 
04:11:14.429 --> 04:11:14.439 align:start position:0%
if that has been thought of or addressed
 
04:11:15.950 --> 04:11:15.960 align:start position:0%
uh but I do know that if there's other
 
04:11:17.510 --> 04:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
alternative treatment facilities from
 
04:11:19.750 --> 04:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
other states also looking for additional
 
04:11:21.830 --> 04:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
locations this could be a door for that
 
04:11:24.109 --> 04:11:24.119 align:start position:0%
which would mean more of these locations
 
04:11:26.269 --> 04:11:26.279 align:start position:0%
in our state that would not be uh
 
04:11:28.550 --> 04:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
providing any product to um to our
 
04:11:31.030 --> 04:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
residents that need it um that would be
 
04:11:32.550 --> 04:11:32.560 align:start position:0%
one thing that I would be concerned of
 
04:11:34.349 --> 04:11:34.359 align:start position:0%
and I do know that uh with lack of
 
04:11:37.030 --> 04:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
regulation in uh other states
 
04:11:40.070 --> 04:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
surrounding us they have struggled with
 
04:11:43.389 --> 04:11:43.399 align:start position:0%
black market sales additional facilities
 
04:11:45.349 --> 04:11:45.359 align:start position:0%
uh being used
 
04:11:50.309 --> 04:11:50.319 align:start position:0%
for uh for for black market sales uh for
 
04:11:53.670 --> 04:11:53.680 align:start position:0%
getting um they they've been purchasing
 
04:11:56.630 --> 04:11:56.640 align:start position:0%
residential homes and using those um and
 
04:11:58.109 --> 04:11:58.119 align:start position:0%
I know there's been a lot of talk about
 
04:11:59.550 --> 04:11:59.560 align:start position:0%
the security and how that would be
 
04:12:01.309 --> 04:12:01.319 align:start position:0%
regulated in this state but I I think
 
04:12:03.469 --> 04:12:03.479 align:start position:0%
that some of that needs to be defined in
 
04:12:05.750 --> 04:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
the language of a of a law so that those
 
04:12:08.550 --> 04:12:08.560 align:start position:0%
things are not exploited um the way that
 
04:12:12.229 --> 04:12:12.239 align:start position:0%
the potential is um at this time so um
 
04:12:13.550 --> 04:12:13.560 align:start position:0%
those were the things that I saw with
 
04:12:17.070 --> 04:12:17.080 align:start position:0%

operators um into the state to uh
 
04:13:17.710 --> 04:13:17.720 align:start position:0%
cultivate and the answer is definitively
 
04:13:21.870 --> 04:13:21.880 align:start position:0%
um this is these second cultivation
 
04:13:24.349 --> 04:13:24.359 align:start position:0%

possible way under this amendment or
 
04:13:34.710 --> 04:13:34.720 align:start position:0%
this this bill and the structure of 126
 
04:13:37.750 --> 04:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
at large um that an outside entity could

04:21:08.910 --> 04:21:08.920 align:start position:0%
okay it is uh 145 actually it's about
 
04:21:11.030 --> 04:21:11.040 align:start position:0%
147 and I'm going to open the public
 
04:21:14.670 --> 04:21:14.680 align:start position:0%
hearing on HB 54 FN and recognize the
 
04:21:16.750 --> 04:21:16.760 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor who is no stranger to this
 
04:21:19.070 --> 04:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
committee representative Wendy
 
04:21:23.750 --> 04:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
Thomas hi everyone um for the oh thank
 
04:21:25.189 --> 04:21:25.199 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and members of the
 
04:21:27.349 --> 04:21:27.359 align:start position:0%
committee um for the record my name is
 
04:21:29.710 --> 04:21:29.720 align:start position:0%
Wendy Thomas and I just want to let you
 
04:21:31.750 --> 04:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
know that I am going to be um
 
04:21:34.149 --> 04:21:34.159 align:start position:0%
introducing another bill on another
 
04:21:36.550 --> 04:21:36.560 align:start position:0%
Topic in another committee at 2 o'clock
 
04:21:39.109 --> 04:21:39.119 align:start position:0%
so I may have to testify and then run
 
04:21:40.830 --> 04:21:40.840 align:start position:0%
but there's others that are going to
 
04:21:44.990 --> 04:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
testify that will take up the cause um
 
04:21:46.670 --> 04:21:46.680 align:start position:0%
uh again my name is Wendy Thomas and I
 
04:21:48.510 --> 04:21:48.520 align:start position:0%
represent the town of marac I'm here to
 
04:21:51.710 --> 04:21:51.720 align:start position:0%
introduce HB 54 which is an act allowing
 
04:21:54.550 --> 04:21:54.560 align:start position:0%
alternative treatment centers to operate
 
04:21:57.830 --> 04:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
for profit from a policy perspective
 
04:22:00.750 --> 04:22:00.760 align:start position:0%
this bill is pretty simple if HB 54
 
04:22:03.510 --> 04:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
becomes law HTC's could convert from
 
04:22:06.469 --> 04:22:06.479 align:start position:0%
their current nonprofit structure and
 
04:22:08.229 --> 04:22:08.239 align:start position:0%
become either a domestic business
 
04:22:10.590 --> 04:22:10.600 align:start position:0%
Corporation or limited liability
 
04:22:13.630 --> 04:22:13.640 align:start position:0%
corporation uh a company their plan of
 
04:22:15.510 --> 04:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
conversion would be subject to approval
 
04:22:18.269 --> 04:22:18.279 align:start position:0%
by their nonprofit board of directors
 
04:22:21.710 --> 04:22:21.720 align:start position:0%
the purpose of HB 54 is to enable atcs
 
04:22:24.550 --> 04:22:24.560 align:start position:0%
to operate and Access Capital more like
 
04:22:26.269 --> 04:22:26.279 align:start position:0%
traditional businesses which should
 
04:22:28.950 --> 04:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
result in them being able to offer lower
 
04:22:32.229 --> 04:22:32.239 align:start position:0%
prices and provide better services for
 
04:22:34.590 --> 04:22:34.600 align:start position:0%
patients I believe representatives from
 
04:22:36.630 --> 04:22:36.640 align:start position:0%
the atcs are here and they can speak
 
04:22:38.670 --> 04:22:38.680 align:start position:0%
much better than I can to the specific
 
04:22:40.870 --> 04:22:40.880 align:start position:0%
challenges and costs that have been
 
04:22:43.269 --> 04:22:43.279 align:start position:0%
associated with the require that they be
 
04:22:44.790 --> 04:22:44.800 align:start position:0%
organized as
 
04:22:47.429 --> 04:22:47.439 align:start position:0%
nonprofits despite not being recognized
 
04:22:49.750 --> 04:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
as non nonprofits by the
 
04:22:52.429 --> 04:22:52.439 align:start position:0%
IRS this issue before us today is not
 
04:22:54.790 --> 04:22:54.800 align:start position:0%
new in fact the House and Senate have
 
04:22:57.389 --> 04:22:57.399 align:start position:0%
passed similar legislation with strong
 
04:23:00.269 --> 04:23:00.279 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support on multiple occasions
 
04:23:02.269 --> 04:23:02.279 align:start position:0%
and two previous bills on this subject
 
04:23:05.469 --> 04:23:05.479 align:start position:0%
have come very close to becoming law in
 
04:23:08.309 --> 04:23:08.319 align:start position:0%
2019 the House and Senate passed Senate
 
04:23:10.630 --> 04:23:10.640 align:start position:0%
Bill 145 but it was vetoed by the
 
04:23:13.550 --> 04:23:13.560 align:start position:0%
governor the override effort fell one
 
04:23:16.630 --> 04:23:16.640 align:start position:0%
vote short in the senate in
 
04:23:19.590 --> 04:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
202022 the house and the Senate passed a
 
04:23:22.990 --> 04:23:23.000 align:start position:0%
SB 38 but it was once again vetoed by
 
04:23:26.109 --> 04:23:26.119 align:start position:0%
the governor the Senate voted 19 to5 to
 
04:23:28.830 --> 04:23:28.840 align:start position:0%
override The veto but the effort fell
 
04:23:31.830 --> 04:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
short one vote in the
 
04:23:34.630 --> 04:23:34.640 align:start position:0%
house additionally many other states
 
04:23:37.349 --> 04:23:37.359 align:start position:0%
initially required nonprofit status for
 
04:23:39.469 --> 04:23:39.479 align:start position:0%
medical cannabis businesses but nearly
 
04:23:41.870 --> 04:23:41.880 align:start position:0%
all have removed this requirement
 
04:23:44.469 --> 04:23:44.479 align:start position:0%
including our three neighboring states
 
04:23:46.790 --> 04:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
Vermont included a nonprofit requirement
 
04:23:48.469 --> 04:23:48.479 align:start position:0%
when it added dispensaries to its
 
04:23:50.469 --> 04:23:50.479 align:start position:0%
medical cannabis law in
 
04:23:54.590 --> 04:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
2011 this requirement was eliminated in
 
04:23:57.950 --> 04:23:57.960 align:start position:0%
2017 Maine started off as nonprofit in
 
04:24:00.790 --> 04:24:00.800 align:start position:0%
2009 and it was eliminated in
 
04:24:04.389 --> 04:24:04.399 align:start position:0%
2018 Massachusetts started as nonprofit
 
04:24:06.710 --> 04:24:06.720 align:start position:0%
in 2012 and the requirement was
 
04:24:08.550 --> 04:24:08.560 align:start position:0%
eliminated in
 
04:24:10.710 --> 04:24:10.720 align:start position:0%
2017 this is important because
 
04:24:12.349 --> 04:24:12.359 align:start position:0%
neighboring states are currently serving
 
04:24:14.389 --> 04:24:14.399 align:start position:0%
served by hundreds of for-profit
 
04:24:16.910 --> 04:24:16.920 align:start position:0%
cannabis businesses which are competing
 
04:24:19.550 --> 04:24:19.560 align:start position:0%
to serve patients and adult consumers
 
04:24:22.269 --> 04:24:22.279 align:start position:0%
including residents of New Hampshire if
 
04:24:24.550 --> 04:24:24.560 align:start position:0%
we want our atcs to be set up for
 
04:24:26.510 --> 04:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
success in this regional market and if
 
04:24:28.030 --> 04:24:28.040 align:start position:0%
we want to keep our New Hampshire
 
04:24:29.750 --> 04:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
patients shopping here at the
 
04:24:32.630 --> 04:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
dispensaries in our state we need to
 
04:24:35.229 --> 04:24:35.239 align:start position:0%
make this change so that we can at least
 
04:24:38.389 --> 04:24:38.399 align:start position:0%
somewhat level the playing field um and
 
04:24:39.990 --> 04:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
lastly I would just like to make the
 
04:24:43.070 --> 04:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
point that uh I have received received
 
04:24:45.349 --> 04:24:45.359 align:start position:0%
uh feedback on this bill and there there
 
04:24:47.630 --> 04:24:47.640 align:start position:0%
seems to be a little bit of confusion
 
04:24:50.510 --> 04:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
going from nonprofit to for-profit does
 
04:24:53.389 --> 04:24:53.399 align:start position:0%
not mean you have to price G gouge your
 
04:24:55.189 --> 04:24:55.199 align:start position:0%
product and make as much profit as
 
04:24:56.750 --> 04:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
possible it means it's a different
 
04:24:59.429 --> 04:24:59.439 align:start position:0%
marketing strategy and it enables you to
 
04:25:01.510 --> 04:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
have different kind of financing and
 
04:25:04.950 --> 04:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
funding I'm happy to take any questions
 
04:25:07.030 --> 04:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
thank you what did you say the previous
 
04:25:09.189 --> 04:25:09.199 align:start position:0%
bills that had got had been vetoed what

their numbers were uh sure um in 2019 it
 
04:25:18.830 --> 04:25:18.840 align:start position:0%
was was SB 145 and SB 145 okay and in
 
04:25:20.990 --> 04:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
2022 it was
 
04:25:24.149 --> 04:25:24.159 align:start position:0%

other
 
04:25:32.670 --> 04:25:32.680 align:start position:0%
questions representative n thank you for
 
04:25:34.990 --> 04:25:35.000 align:start position:0%
T um Mr chairman thanks for taking my
 
04:25:37.870 --> 04:25:37.880 align:start position:0%
question so nothing would change about
 
04:25:39.630 --> 04:25:39.640 align:start position:0%
the funding mandate that the system
 
04:25:41.870 --> 04:25:41.880 align:start position:0%
would still have to be self-sufficient
 
04:25:43.910 --> 04:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
but would dramatically increase the
 
04:25:46.870 --> 04:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
options that the centers would have for
 
04:25:50.590 --> 04:25:50.600 align:start position:0%
funding themselves is that correct yes
 
04:25:54.189 --> 04:25:54.199 align:start position:0%
yes other representative

Lamonte thank you and thank you for
 
04:25:59.469 --> 04:25:59.479 align:start position:0%

04:26:04.030 --> 04:26:04.040 align:start position:0%
other medical practices or services or
 
04:26:09.710 --> 04:26:09.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:11.630 --> 04:26:11.640 align:start position:0%
nonprofit I don't know if I'm the
 
04:26:13.630 --> 04:26:13.640 align:start position:0%
definitive answer on this but
 
04:26:16.030 --> 04:26:16.040 align:start position:0%
no okay
 
04:26:18.950 --> 04:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
thanks other
 
04:26:26.070 --> 04:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:29.790 --> 04:26:29.800 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Sue homo
 
04:26:31.550 --> 04:26:31.560 align:start position:0%
from Sam New
 
04:26:33.790 --> 04:26:33.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm still mispronouncing your
 
04:26:35.750 --> 04:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
name aren't I oh that's okay that's fine
 
04:26:35.760 --> 04:26:36.550 align:start position:0%
name aren't I oh that's okay that's fine
by

04:26:36.550 --> 04:26:36.560 align:start position:0%
by
 
04:26:40.030 --> 04:26:40.040 align:start position:0%
me so thank you again um Sue hola Sam
 
04:26:43.109 --> 04:26:43.119 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um I I Rec recognize that
 
04:26:45.950 --> 04:26:45.960 align:start position:0%
I may appear to many today as Dr no just
 
04:26:48.910 --> 04:26:48.920 align:start position:0%
no and I'm I'm not trying to be Dr no
 
04:26:51.109 --> 04:26:51.119 align:start position:0%
but I I am trying to bring up
 
04:26:52.710 --> 04:26:52.720 align:start position:0%
information that needs to be considered
 
04:26:55.149 --> 04:26:55.159 align:start position:0%
because oftentimes legislation gets
 
04:26:57.510 --> 04:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
passed and the unintended consequences
 
04:26:59.750 --> 04:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
do not get considered when the medical
 
04:27:01.790 --> 04:27:01.800 align:start position:0%
marijuana program was enacted it was
 
04:27:03.590 --> 04:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
with the intention that the atcs have
 
04:27:05.750 --> 04:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
nonprofit restrictions for a variety of
 
04:27:07.910 --> 04:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
reasons and one of them was to ensure
 
04:27:10.830 --> 04:27:10.840 align:start position:0%
that our citizens to ensure uh our
 
04:27:15.109 --> 04:27:15.119 align:start position:0%
citizens that um that marijuana
 
04:27:17.389 --> 04:27:17.399 align:start position:0%
nonprofit influence did not flood into
 
04:27:17.399 --> 04:27:18.149 align:start position:0%
nonprofit influence did not flood into
our

04:27:18.149 --> 04:27:18.159 align:start position:0%
our
 
04:27:20.910 --> 04:27:20.920 align:start position:0%
state our current atcs must operate
 
04:27:22.710 --> 04:27:22.720 align:start position:0%
within the confines of nonprofit for
 
04:27:24.710 --> 04:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
this for this reason the fact that they
 
04:27:26.550 --> 04:27:26.560 align:start position:0%
can't take advantage of a tax benefit
 
04:27:28.950 --> 04:27:28.960 align:start position:0%
from being a nonprofit because they are
 
04:27:31.950 --> 04:27:31.960 align:start position:0%
selling a federally illegal schedule one
 
04:27:35.189 --> 04:27:35.199 align:start position:0%
drug is the conundrum of our state's own
 
04:27:37.109 --> 04:27:37.119 align:start position:0%
making and exactly what the state signed
 
04:27:39.030 --> 04:27:39.040 align:start position:0%
on for when we created the therapeutic
 
04:27:41.590 --> 04:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
cannabis program this was the trade-off
 
04:27:43.590 --> 04:27:43.600 align:start position:0%
to ensure that New Hampshire keep some
 
04:27:45.349 --> 04:27:45.359 align:start position:0%
sort of lid on the negative effects of
 
04:27:47.070 --> 04:27:47.080 align:start position:0%
what happens in other states and what
 
04:27:49.189 --> 04:27:49.199 align:start position:0%
has happened in other states when the
 
04:27:51.109 --> 04:27:51.119 align:start position:0%
marijuana Lobby dollars get in bedw
 
04:27:53.670 --> 04:27:53.680 align:start position:0%
State House policy in a for-profit
 
04:27:54.990 --> 04:27:55.000 align:start position:0%
environment those who invest in a
 
04:27:57.070 --> 04:27:57.080 align:start position:0%
medical marijuana business expect
 
04:27:59.990 --> 04:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
Financial growth in return they expect
 
04:28:02.910 --> 04:28:02.920 align:start position:0%
it if a respon if the responsible Public
 
04:28:04.590 --> 04:28:04.600 align:start position:0%
Safety safeguards and compassionate care
 
04:28:06.429 --> 04:28:06.439 align:start position:0%
for medical marijuana users is the
 
04:28:08.870 --> 04:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
actual goal of legislators and our
 
04:28:10.910 --> 04:28:10.920 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis board then it will
 
04:28:14.070 --> 04:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
ensure that atc's remain nonprofit um
 
04:28:15.429 --> 04:28:15.439 align:start position:0%
one of the things that one of the
 
04:28:17.630 --> 04:28:17.640 align:start position:0%
questions that uh rep I'm sorry I don't
 
04:28:18.630 --> 04:28:18.640 align:start position:0%
know how to say your name you had a
 
04:28:22.189 --> 04:28:22.199 align:start position:0%
question about what other medical places
 
04:28:24.870 --> 04:28:24.880 align:start position:0%
are for-profit and what are nonprofit
 
04:28:27.349 --> 04:28:27.359 align:start position:0%
required to be nonprofit I'm not sure if
 
04:28:29.550 --> 04:28:29.560 align:start position:0%
anyone I mean all we have to do is step
 
04:28:31.229 --> 04:28:31.239 align:start position:0%
back and look what are some of the
 
04:28:32.750 --> 04:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
issues that people are actually having
 
04:28:35.950 --> 04:28:35.960 align:start position:0%
with the today's current US Health Care
 
04:28:39.070 --> 04:28:39.080 align:start position:0%
System the for-profit at some one time
 
04:28:41.590 --> 04:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
they're villains and then with medical
 
04:28:43.870 --> 04:28:43.880 align:start position:0%
marijuana they're not villains you know
 
04:28:45.510 --> 04:28:45.520 align:start position:0%
I'm not I'm not calling anyone a villain
 
04:28:47.710 --> 04:28:47.720 align:start position:0%
or not I'm just saying that we have
 
04:28:49.590 --> 04:28:49.600 align:start position:0%
healthc care companies for profit seem
 
04:28:51.790 --> 04:28:51.800 align:start position:0%
to be a problem some of the hospitals
 
04:28:53.309 --> 04:28:53.319 align:start position:0%
Hospital administrations when they go
 
04:28:55.389 --> 04:28:55.399 align:start position:0%
nonpr when they go for-profit seem to be
 
04:28:59.070 --> 04:28:59.080 align:start position:0%
a problem I I just there's a hypocrisy
 
04:29:02.309 --> 04:29:02.319 align:start position:0%
to to the conversations we have about
 
04:29:05.229 --> 04:29:05.239 align:start position:0%
for-profit nonprofit We intentionally
 
04:29:07.269 --> 04:29:07.279 align:start position:0%
made the state of New Hampshire's uh
 
04:29:09.630 --> 04:29:09.640 align:start position:0%
medical marijuana program to be such as
 
04:29:11.630 --> 04:29:11.640 align:start position:0%
to keep a lid on some of these negative
 
04:29:14.389 --> 04:29:14.399 align:start position:0%
consequen es has happened even though I
 
04:29:15.830 --> 04:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
understand the issues we have with Maine
 
04:29:17.710 --> 04:29:17.720 align:start position:0%
and Massachusetts and Vermont but
 
04:29:19.349 --> 04:29:19.359 align:start position:0%
actually if you look a little closer to
 
04:29:21.070 --> 04:29:21.080 align:start position:0%
those I mean those things are going off
 
04:29:23.950 --> 04:29:23.960 align:start position:0%
the rails and that's that's all I have
 
04:29:23.960 --> 04:29:24.870 align:start position:0%
the rails and that's that's all I have
to

04:29:24.870 --> 04:29:24.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:29:29.349 --> 04:29:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:34.189 --> 04:29:34.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:36.710 --> 04:29:36.720 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Mike
 
04:29:44.950 --> 04:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:46.269 --> 04:29:46.279 align:start position:0%
good afternoon again Mr chairman and
 
04:29:47.590 --> 04:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is Mike
 
04:29:50.550 --> 04:29:50.560 align:start position:0%
glofin I represent Sanctuary TC I uh had
 
04:29:52.269 --> 04:29:52.279 align:start position:0%
forwarded to the committee uh
 
04:29:56.630 --> 04:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
electronically a u memo on the um this
 
04:29:59.030 --> 04:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
bill I call this bill my full employment
 
04:30:00.229 --> 04:30:00.239 align:start position:0%
bill because I've been working on it
 
04:30:00.239 --> 04:30:01.109 align:start position:0%
bill because I've been working on it
since

04:30:01.109 --> 04:30:01.119 align:start position:0%
since
 
04:30:04.109 --> 04:30:04.119 align:start position:0%
2019 uh and the history of the bill is
 
04:30:07.149 --> 04:30:07.159 align:start position:0%
that the House and Senate have passed
 
04:30:09.510 --> 04:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
this bill every time it's come before
 
04:30:11.309 --> 04:30:11.319 align:start position:0%
them and the reason they passed this
 
04:30:13.550 --> 04:30:13.560 align:start position:0%
bill is is because again the number one
 
04:30:15.790 --> 04:30:15.800 align:start position:0%
complaint of therapeutic cannabis
 
04:30:20.030 --> 04:30:20.040 align:start position:0%
patients is price the not for-profits um
 
04:30:23.070 --> 04:30:23.080 align:start position:0%
designation of the atc's if you look
 
04:30:25.429 --> 04:30:25.439 align:start position:0%
back in the history of why and how the
 
04:30:28.510 --> 04:30:28.520 align:start position:0%
bill was passed it's hard to find the
 
04:30:30.990 --> 04:30:31.000 align:start position:0%
reason it's almost like having a car and
 
04:30:32.510 --> 04:30:32.520 align:start position:0%
having to walk around it three times
 
04:30:34.710 --> 04:30:34.720 align:start position:0%
before you can get in started there's no
 
04:30:37.550 --> 04:30:37.560 align:start position:0%
benefit for the not for-profit status to
 
04:30:40.429 --> 04:30:40.439 align:start position:0%
the uh atc's or to the patients there's
 
04:30:42.349 --> 04:30:42.359 align:start position:0%
no exemption of property tax there's no
 
04:30:45.229 --> 04:30:45.239 align:start position:0%
exemption on anything that a for-profit
 
04:30:46.670 --> 04:30:46.680 align:start position:0%
corporation gets in Hampshire is
 
04:30:49.349 --> 04:30:49.359 align:start position:0%
unavailable to the atcs all it does is
 
04:30:52.510 --> 04:30:52.520 align:start position:0%
ADD cost and it adds um inability to
 
04:30:55.510 --> 04:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
raise Capital they can't sell stock uh
 
04:30:57.030 --> 04:30:57.040 align:start position:0%
they can't the only reason they get way
 
04:30:58.429 --> 04:30:58.439 align:start position:0%
they get money is through grants which
 
04:31:00.070 --> 04:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
it can't get from it even nobody gives a
 
04:31:02.590 --> 04:31:02.600 align:start position:0%
grant so if you if you think back you
 
04:31:05.030 --> 04:31:05.040 align:start position:0%
know in a historical perspective the
 
04:31:08.750 --> 04:31:08.760 align:start position:0%
2019 2020 2022 legislators all said this
 
04:31:11.229 --> 04:31:11.239 align:start position:0%
is a good idea the um it's interesting
 
04:31:13.389 --> 04:31:13.399 align:start position:0%
if you look at the The veto override I
 
04:31:15.389 --> 04:31:15.399 align:start position:0%
think it was Senate Bill 38 where the
 
04:31:18.870 --> 04:31:18.880 align:start position:0%
Senate voted 19 to5 to override The veto
 
04:31:21.670 --> 04:31:21.680 align:start position:0%
the house veto is was actually house
 
04:31:22.830 --> 04:31:22.840 align:start position:0%
over was actually one of those
 
04:31:25.870 --> 04:31:25.880 align:start position:0%
mathematical um U anomalies where it's
 
04:31:28.950 --> 04:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
2/3 and not 66% because if you look at
 
04:31:30.590 --> 04:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
the numbers I gave you I think I laid it
 
04:31:33.750 --> 04:31:33.760 align:start position:0%
out that it came out to be I think 65.99
 
04:31:35.630 --> 04:31:35.640 align:start position:0%
n% or whatever it was where they missed
 
04:31:38.990 --> 04:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
by one thousand of a percent to be 2/3
 
04:31:41.910 --> 04:31:41.920 align:start position:0%
so it is not a novel idea it's something
 
04:31:44.510 --> 04:31:44.520 align:start position:0%
that we've looked at for almost six
 
04:31:47.590 --> 04:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
years and said what benefit is anybody
 
04:31:49.710 --> 04:31:49.720 align:start position:0%
getting the patients get no benefit the
 
04:31:51.510 --> 04:31:51.520 align:start position:0%
states get no benefit the only thing it
 
04:31:54.950 --> 04:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
does is create this uh artificial uh not
 
04:31:57.590 --> 04:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
for-profit it's not a not for-profit uh
 
04:31:59.910 --> 04:31:59.920 align:start position:0%
they make money uh if they are turned
 
04:32:01.790 --> 04:32:01.800 align:start position:0%
into a for-profit we had had projections
 
04:32:03.469 --> 04:32:03.479 align:start position:0%
several years ago the price would drop
 
04:32:06.550 --> 04:32:06.560 align:start position:0%
10% because the cost of capital when you
 
04:32:09.710 --> 04:32:09.720 align:start position:0%
lend money to a u a company or you sell
 
04:32:12.349 --> 04:32:12.359 align:start position:0%
stock the expectation is to make profit
 
04:32:14.070 --> 04:32:14.080 align:start position:0%
but you don't have to pay it back right
 
04:32:16.030 --> 04:32:16.040 align:start position:0%
it's an investment so there are no
 
04:32:17.870 --> 04:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
Investments they have been lucky enough
 
04:32:19.670 --> 04:32:19.680 align:start position:0%
in Hampshire to have operators who have
 
04:32:22.070 --> 04:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
had enough money to be able to create
 
04:32:25.189 --> 04:32:25.199 align:start position:0%
the businesses but this is won't expand
 
04:32:28.149 --> 04:32:28.159 align:start position:0%
anything it's been a it's not a novel
 
04:32:30.750 --> 04:32:30.760 align:start position:0%
idea uh I've given you the history of it
 
04:32:34.590 --> 04:32:34.600 align:start position:0%
it's um uh it will do no harm it will
 
04:32:36.950 --> 04:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
only create an opportunity to lower the
 
04:32:39.990 --> 04:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
prices and improve the the whole
 
04:32:40.000 --> 04:32:43.349 align:start position:0%
prices and improve the the whole
operations

04:32:43.349 --> 04:32:43.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:44.990 --> 04:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
Qui uh representative
 
04:32:47.870 --> 04:32:47.880 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you very much and and my
 
04:32:50.109 --> 04:32:50.119 align:start position:0%
apologies I'm a little behind on my bill
 
04:32:52.950 --> 04:32:52.960 align:start position:0%
reading so I haven't actually gone all
 
04:32:56.070 --> 04:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
the way through this one um could you
 
04:32:59.670 --> 04:32:59.680 align:start position:0%
explain to me if there is anything I and
 
04:33:02.269 --> 04:33:02.279 align:start position:0%
I think that the concern that people
 
04:33:08.070 --> 04:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
have with thinking oh not uh for-profit
 
04:33:12.269 --> 04:33:12.279 align:start position:0%
corporations stock shareholders Prof
 
04:33:15.551 --> 04:33:15.561 align:start position:0%
profets um profits that get to go
 
04:33:19.390 --> 04:33:19.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:21.390 --> 04:33:21.400 align:start position:0%
entity are
 
04:33:24.150 --> 04:33:24.160 align:start position:0%
there parts of this
 
04:33:28.269 --> 04:33:28.279 align:start position:0%
legislation as proposed today that inure
 
04:33:31.109 --> 04:33:31.119 align:start position:0%
that that's not going to happen or I and
 
04:33:32.990 --> 04:33:33.000 align:start position:0%
I I think that the people who are
 
04:33:35.830 --> 04:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
opposed have a real issue in their heads
 
04:33:39.109 --> 04:33:39.119 align:start position:0%
and about oh my gosh you know this is
 
04:33:40.869 --> 04:33:40.879 align:start position:0%
suddenly going to become a prophet
 
04:33:42.990 --> 04:33:43.000 align:start position:0%
center that is going to allow profit to
 
04:33:46.709 --> 04:33:46.719 align:start position:0%
be taken out of the business and
 
04:33:52.109 --> 04:33:52.119 align:start position:0%
therefore it may not lower costs and um
 
04:33:54.230 --> 04:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
I understand that that's not the intent
 
04:33:56.150 --> 04:33:56.160 align:start position:0%
currently but I want to know is there
 
04:33:57.949 --> 04:33:57.959 align:start position:0%
anything in here that prevents that from
 
04:33:59.470 --> 04:33:59.480 align:start position:0%
happening well in the in the body of the
 
04:34:01.150 --> 04:34:01.160 align:start position:0%
bill which uh has been in the body of
 
04:34:02.789 --> 04:34:02.799 align:start position:0%
the bill for the last six years is a
 
04:34:04.789 --> 04:34:04.799 align:start position:0%
Prohibition against selling uh to
 
04:34:07.189 --> 04:34:07.199 align:start position:0%
outstate foreign corporations so if an
 
04:34:09.150 --> 04:34:09.160 align:start position:0%
ATC in New Hampshire is going to raise
 
04:34:10.629 --> 04:34:10.639 align:start position:0%
money via selling the stock they
 
04:34:12.470 --> 04:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
Incorporated themselves they would not
 
04:34:15.070 --> 04:34:15.080 align:start position:0%
be able to sell um shares to outside
 
04:34:16.390 --> 04:34:16.400 align:start position:0%
foreign corporations so foreign
 
04:34:17.949 --> 04:34:17.959 align:start position:0%
corporation meaning simply a corporation
 
04:34:19.869 --> 04:34:19.879 align:start position:0%
is not registered within the in
 
04:34:24.349 --> 04:34:24.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:26.429 --> 04:34:26.439 align:start position:0%
it's I think if the bill came in and
 
04:34:28.109 --> 04:34:28.119 align:start position:0%
said can we operate as a normal business
 
04:34:29.590 --> 04:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
there would be less issue because you
 
04:34:31.470 --> 04:34:31.480 align:start position:0%
see the word for-profit there's a lot of
 
04:34:34.150 --> 04:34:34.160 align:start position:0%
for-profit companies that lose money I
 
04:34:36.510 --> 04:34:36.520 align:start position:0%
just quite understood it's just a
 
04:34:38.429 --> 04:34:38.439 align:start position:0%
designation that says I can operate as a
 
04:34:41.429 --> 04:34:41.439 align:start position:0%
normal business I don't have to create
 
04:34:44.470 --> 04:34:44.480 align:start position:0%
uh some mythical management structure
 
04:34:46.070 --> 04:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
that doesn't you know is getting
 
04:34:48.429 --> 04:34:48.439 align:start position:0%
compensated as opposed to a regular
 
04:34:52.310 --> 04:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
Corporation it's a um uh and again the
 
04:34:54.670 --> 04:34:54.680 align:start position:0%
price issue if you have the opportunity
 
04:34:56.470 --> 04:34:56.480 align:start position:0%
to do more business by lowering your
 
04:34:58.269 --> 04:34:58.279 align:start position:0%
price that's what you're going to do and
 
04:35:00.269 --> 04:35:00.279 align:start position:0%
right now the biggest complaint is
 
04:35:02.551 --> 04:35:02.561 align:start position:0%
patients say I can't afford it so if you
 
04:35:04.590 --> 04:35:04.600 align:start position:0%
can get your two or four ounces but the
 
04:35:07.310 --> 04:35:07.320 align:start position:0%
next week you've got no money left so
 
04:35:11.349 --> 04:35:11.359 align:start position:0%
the idea is as Matt said earlier Grant
 
04:35:13.629 --> 04:35:13.639 align:start position:0%
Leaf has ability to grow more product
 
04:35:15.990 --> 04:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
but they can't sell it because it's very
 
04:35:20.510 --> 04:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
uh cost it's it's expensive and so uh
 
04:35:23.629 --> 04:35:23.639 align:start position:0%
there's no nefarious idea here to create
 
04:35:26.510 --> 04:35:26.520 align:start position:0%
um an outstate marijuana giant buying in
 
04:35:29.189 --> 04:35:29.199 align:start position:0%
we don't do enough business to to you
 
04:35:31.269 --> 04:35:31.279 align:start position:0%
know create any great interest from out
 
04:35:34.390 --> 04:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
ofate Mega marijuana and I think as a um
 
04:35:37.109 --> 04:35:37.119 align:start position:0%
a thought that is pervasive today the
 
04:35:39.029 --> 04:35:39.039 align:start position:0%
marijuana Golden Goose has shrunk
 
04:35:41.150 --> 04:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
dramatically uh prices have dropped over
 
04:35:43.349 --> 04:35:43.359 align:start position:0%
the country dramatically so the thought
 
04:35:45.869 --> 04:35:45.879 align:start position:0%
of a Canada Cannabis or one of the big
 
04:35:47.830 --> 04:35:47.840 align:start position:0%
companies saying oh man I can get into
 
04:35:48.990 --> 04:35:49.000 align:start position:0%
hisory well they couldn't get in anyway
 
04:35:52.390 --> 04:35:52.400 align:start position:0%
for 3 years Max minimum but there's no
 
04:35:55.349 --> 04:35:55.359 align:start position:0%
um dramatic profit available we only
 
04:35:57.789 --> 04:35:57.799 align:start position:0%
have 13,000 patients so it's it's
 
04:35:59.789 --> 04:35:59.799 align:start position:0%
something that I wish the bill said can
 
04:36:01.349 --> 04:36:01.359 align:start position:0%
we operate as a normal
 
04:36:03.429 --> 04:36:03.439 align:start position:0%
business thank
 
04:36:05.869 --> 04:36:05.879 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
04:36:08.189 --> 04:36:08.199 align:start position:0%
Nel thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
04:36:10.869 --> 04:36:10.879 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I think it's
 
04:36:12.869 --> 04:36:12.879 align:start position:0%
wonderful that as imperfect as our
 
04:36:15.470 --> 04:36:15.480 align:start position:0%
system is in New Hampshire and I having
 
04:36:16.670 --> 04:36:16.680 align:start position:0%
been involved with it since the
 
04:36:18.230 --> 04:36:18.240 align:start position:0%
beginning I understand why it was
 
04:36:20.189 --> 04:36:20.199 align:start position:0%
created the way it is but as imperfect
 
04:36:21.150 --> 04:36:21.160 align:start position:0%
as it
 
04:36:24.310 --> 04:36:24.320 align:start position:0%
is I'm concerned about the long-term
 
04:36:27.189 --> 04:36:27.199 align:start position:0%
viability if the current system change
 
04:36:29.029 --> 04:36:29.039 align:start position:0%
stays the same in other words the way
 
04:36:31.230 --> 04:36:31.240 align:start position:0%
the nonprofit element I mean can you
 
04:36:33.349 --> 04:36:33.359 align:start position:0%
give me a crystal ball and tell me can
 
04:36:35.310 --> 04:36:35.320 align:start position:0%
you guys stay in business going forward
 
04:36:37.629 --> 04:36:37.639 align:start position:0%
if we don't make changes like this no
 
04:36:39.150 --> 04:36:39.160 align:start position:0%
you'll continue to have a program that
 
04:36:41.590 --> 04:36:41.600 align:start position:0%
can't achieve its ultimate um
 
04:36:44.269 --> 04:36:44.279 align:start position:0%
productivity or its ultimate goals uh
 
04:36:46.990 --> 04:36:47.000 align:start position:0%
and and it is a a dramatic hamstring to
 
04:36:50.510 --> 04:36:50.520 align:start position:0%
uh not be able to go out and find uh a
 
04:36:52.750 --> 04:36:52.760 align:start position:0%
capital investor uh because a capital
 
04:36:53.869 --> 04:36:53.879 align:start position:0%
investor is going to say okay I'm going
 
04:36:55.709 --> 04:36:55.719 align:start position:0%
to wait for my return and see how it
 
04:36:58.910 --> 04:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
goes and again uh we're under capacity
 
04:37:02.551 --> 04:37:02.561 align:start position:0%
and a lot of people don't go ahead
 
04:37:05.551 --> 04:37:05.561 align:start position:0%
followup followup are you in danger
 
04:37:08.390 --> 04:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
going belly up I can only speak for our
 
04:37:11.189 --> 04:37:11.199 align:start position:0%
guys and we are in Plymouth and in
 
04:37:11.199 --> 04:37:12.070 align:start position:0%
guys and we are in Plymouth and in
Congress

04:37:12.070 --> 04:37:12.080 align:start position:0%
Congress
 
04:37:13.869 --> 04:37:13.879 align:start position:0%
Conway would get eaten alive across the
 
04:37:15.869 --> 04:37:15.879 align:start position:0%
border in um
 
04:37:18.551 --> 04:37:18.561 align:start position:0%
fryberg so you can have medical
 
04:37:20.150 --> 04:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
marijuana patients in New Hampshire who
 
04:37:23.789 --> 04:37:23.799 align:start position:0%
get their card uh go to a clinic for a
 
04:37:25.269 --> 04:37:25.279 align:start position:0%
while and then they start searching for
 
04:37:27.189 --> 04:37:27.199 align:start position:0%
an alternative and you go to Maine
 
04:37:28.150 --> 04:37:28.160 align:start position:0%
you're going to get some products that
 
04:37:30.109 --> 04:37:30.119 align:start position:0%
haven't been tested uh you got no idea
 
04:37:31.150 --> 04:37:31.160 align:start position:0%
what you're getting at some point this
 
04:37:34.070 --> 04:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
time so would they go a belly up I
 
04:37:35.189 --> 04:37:35.199 align:start position:0%
couldn't say that today but I can say
 
04:37:36.910 --> 04:37:36.920 align:start position:0%
one thing uh they're not going to look
 
04:37:39.390 --> 04:37:39.400 align:start position:0%
for expanding Conway uh until they get
 
04:37:41.029 --> 04:37:41.039 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to be able to compete
 
04:37:42.949 --> 04:37:42.959 align:start position:0%
same thing with the Tasco which is in
 
04:37:44.949 --> 04:37:44.959 align:start position:0%
Dover I mean they're close to me we've
 
04:37:47.789 --> 04:37:47.799 align:start position:0%
got clinics close to
 
04:37:50.070 --> 04:37:50.080 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts if everybody in the
 
04:37:52.029 --> 04:37:52.039 align:start position:0%
business was not for-profit it would be
 
04:37:53.830 --> 04:37:53.840 align:start position:0%
equal playing field that we have the
 
04:37:56.310 --> 04:37:56.320 align:start position:0%
only not for-profit medical marijuana
 
04:37:57.990 --> 04:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
system in the country I guess there's
 
04:38:01.150 --> 04:38:01.160 align:start position:0%
one still in Arizona but the um it's
 
04:38:05.910 --> 04:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
just like again it's been a long time
 
04:38:07.470 --> 04:38:07.480 align:start position:0%
coming the legislators have always
 
04:38:09.590 --> 04:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
agreed let's let us go where it's going
 
04:38:12.349 --> 04:38:12.359 align:start position:0%
and not and go get the profit system
 
04:38:15.150 --> 04:38:15.160 align:start position:0%
going but and again if it's if it's a
 
04:38:18.310 --> 04:38:18.320 align:start position:0%
becomes a total uh cash grab I mean uh
 
04:38:19.830 --> 04:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
the department of HHS can come in and
 
04:38:21.949 --> 04:38:21.959 align:start position:0%
say let's put it back but right now they
 
04:38:23.869 --> 04:38:23.879 align:start position:0%
not these guys aren't
 
04:38:26.869 --> 04:38:26.879 align:start position:0%
thriving thank you representative
 
04:38:29.551 --> 04:38:29.561 align:start position:0%
Weber so that leads me to another
 
04:38:33.429 --> 04:38:33.439 align:start position:0%
question which is um they're not
 
04:38:36.510 --> 04:38:36.520 align:start position:0%
thriving there's a very limited market
 
04:38:37.949 --> 04:38:37.959 align:start position:0%
in New
 
04:38:41.551 --> 04:38:41.561 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh which is
 
04:38:43.830 --> 04:38:43.840 align:start position:0%
there's excess capacity which is not
 
04:38:46.750 --> 04:38:46.760 align:start position:0%
being utilized or excess space maybe not
 
04:38:49.750 --> 04:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
excess capacity
 
04:38:53.349 --> 04:38:53.359 align:start position:0%
so how is it that an investor is going
 
04:38:56.869 --> 04:38:56.879 align:start position:0%
to rush into to invest in this business
 
04:38:59.109 --> 04:38:59.119 align:start position:0%
because surely they want their money
 
04:39:02.590 --> 04:39:02.600 align:start position:0%
back and they want to make a profit of
 
04:39:05.869 --> 04:39:05.879 align:start position:0%
some kind which is not unreasonable the
 
04:39:07.510 --> 04:39:07.520 align:start position:0%
only thing I'm concerned about going
 
04:39:11.949 --> 04:39:11.959 align:start position:0%
forward is unreasonable profits but
 
04:39:14.590 --> 04:39:14.600 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing two different narratives
 
04:39:16.470 --> 04:39:16.480 align:start position:0%
here and I wonder if you can justify
 
04:39:17.830 --> 04:39:17.840 align:start position:0%
those to me well let me give you the
 
04:39:21.230 --> 04:39:21.240 align:start position:0%
first narrative um atcx I need
 
04:39:23.629 --> 04:39:23.639 align:start position:0%
$100,000 I can't sell stocks so I
 
04:39:25.789 --> 04:39:25.799 align:start position:0%
borrowed from Mr Smith he wants
 
04:39:28.789 --> 04:39:28.799 align:start position:0%
8% my investor says I don't want 8% I
 
04:39:30.150 --> 04:39:30.160 align:start position:0%
want to participate in the profits of
 
04:39:32.990 --> 04:39:33.000 align:start position:0%
the business as it goes so when you're
 
04:39:36.590 --> 04:39:36.600 align:start position:0%
stuck only being able to borrow money uh
 
04:39:39.788 --> 04:39:39.798 align:start position:0%
your cost of operations are dramatically
 
04:39:42.190 --> 04:39:42.200 align:start position:0%
impacted so to be ble to go for a
 
04:39:43.910 --> 04:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
for-profit I had I could have get an
 
04:39:47.708 --> 04:39:47.718 align:start position:0%
investor versus a a um a loan the loan
 
04:39:48.868 --> 04:39:48.878 align:start position:0%
is always going to cost you more money
 
04:39:50.270 --> 04:39:50.280 align:start position:0%
and the way interest rates out today
 
04:39:52.470 --> 04:39:52.480 align:start position:0%
it's probably going to be eight or n%
 
04:39:54.070 --> 04:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
plus the fact you can't borrow from a
 
04:39:55.868 --> 04:39:55.878 align:start position:0%
bank so you're going to have to go to a
 
04:39:59.550 --> 04:39:59.560 align:start position:0%
private investor that might be 15% and
 
04:40:01.628 --> 04:40:01.638 align:start position:0%
and so that there's no abilities to get
 
04:40:03.550 --> 04:40:03.560 align:start position:0%
Capital at a reasonable cost meaning
 
04:40:05.948 --> 04:40:05.958 align:start position:0%
capital I give you $100,000 I say okay
 
04:40:07.788 --> 04:40:07.798 align:start position:0%
next year what do we have to split up as
 
04:40:09.910 --> 04:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
opposed to every month I about 6,000
 
04:40:14.510 --> 04:40:14.520 align:start position:0%
bucks so it's a um the the neg negative
 
04:40:16.350 --> 04:40:16.360 align:start position:0%
the hamstring of a business by not
 
04:40:19.470 --> 04:40:19.480 align:start position:0%
having the ability to get capital is
 
04:40:22.430 --> 04:40:22.440 align:start position:0%
what kills it and again should they
 
04:40:26.310 --> 04:40:26.320 align:start position:0%
become I I I don't have the crystal ball
 
04:40:28.590 --> 04:40:28.600 align:start position:0%
but the
 
04:40:31.990 --> 04:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
untapped um capabilities are because
 
04:40:36.310 --> 04:40:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:38.550 --> 04:40:38.560 align:start position:0%
it other
 
04:40:41.430 --> 04:40:41.440 align:start position:0%
questions representative Nel thank you
 
04:40:43.470 --> 04:40:43.480 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman as a followup to the
 
04:40:45.948 --> 04:40:45.958 align:start position:0%
followup to the followup
 
04:40:49.310 --> 04:40:49.320 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm all my patients go to Main
 
04:40:52.150 --> 04:40:52.160 align:start position:0%
and Massachusetts so my question is is
 
04:40:54.150 --> 04:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
do we really have a limited market or is
 
04:40:56.030 --> 04:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
it artificially limited because of the
 
04:40:58.150 --> 04:40:58.160 align:start position:0%
price here I'm with you on that
 
04:41:00.990 --> 04:41:01.000 align:start position:0%
completely if we had a for-profit system
 
04:41:03.510 --> 04:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
and a price that was attractive would
 
04:41:07.110 --> 04:41:07.120 align:start position:0%
create there'd be more people I mean
 
04:41:09.830 --> 04:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
just like I represent Bingo clients and
 
04:41:12.190 --> 04:41:12.200 align:start position:0%
if people go looking for the big jackpot
 
04:41:13.948 --> 04:41:13.958 align:start position:0%
in this business they go looking for the
 
04:41:16.910 --> 04:41:16.920 align:start position:0%
best price again the therapeutic
 
04:41:19.270 --> 04:41:19.280 align:start position:0%
cannabis products that you can offer are
 
04:41:20.430 --> 04:41:20.440 align:start position:0%
limited by the amount of money you can
 
04:41:22.470 --> 04:41:22.480 align:start position:0%
spend because you'll say I've got 12
 
04:41:24.628 --> 04:41:24.638 align:start position:0%
products eight sell good four don't you
 
04:41:25.788 --> 04:41:25.798 align:start position:0%
don't get rid of the four because I
 
04:41:27.590 --> 04:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
can't afford to keep producing them so
 
04:41:29.670 --> 04:41:29.680 align:start position:0%
your your product offerings are going to
 
04:41:31.070 --> 04:41:31.080 align:start position:0%
suffer because of your lack of
 
04:41:31.080 --> 04:41:32.788 align:start position:0%
suffer because of your lack of
investment

04:41:32.788 --> 04:41:32.798 align:start position:0%
investment
 
04:41:35.430 --> 04:41:35.440 align:start position:0%
Capital again I would only say look at
 
04:41:37.830 --> 04:41:37.840 align:start position:0%
the note I put together which gives the
 
04:41:40.910 --> 04:41:40.920 align:start position:0%
history again this is um obviously I'm
 
04:41:44.110 --> 04:41:44.120 align:start position:0%
advocate for it but it's it's not an
 
04:41:46.990 --> 04:41:47.000 align:start position:0%
earthshaking idea can we operate as a
 
04:41:49.470 --> 04:41:49.480 align:start position:0%
normal domestic Corporation or normal
 
04:41:52.470 --> 04:41:52.480 align:start position:0%
domestic LLC I don't see I I think
 
04:41:54.070 --> 04:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
that's the answer the answer is yes to
 
04:41:56.550 --> 04:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
that and it has been for the last six
 
04:41:58.590 --> 04:41:58.600 align:start position:0%
years other
 
04:42:00.750 --> 04:42:00.760 align:start position:0%
questions thank you so much Mr chairman
 
04:42:04.510 --> 04:42:04.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:07.310 --> 04:42:07.320 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to testify as Matt
 
04:42:19.628 --> 04:42:19.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:21.990 --> 04:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman one last time for
 
04:42:24.750 --> 04:42:24.760 align:start position:0%
the record Matt Simon Granite Leaf
 
04:42:27.510 --> 04:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
cannabis and we do support the
 
04:42:30.590 --> 04:42:30.600 align:start position:0%
bill I'm not a business guy I've worked
 
04:42:33.310 --> 04:42:33.320 align:start position:0%
for nonprofits in the advocacy space for
 
04:42:34.708 --> 04:42:34.718 align:start position:0%
the last 18
 
04:42:37.670 --> 04:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
years um I've been working for granite
 
04:42:39.150 --> 04:42:39.160 align:start position:0%
leaf for the last three and a half years
 
04:42:41.590 --> 04:42:41.600 align:start position:0%
so I've got a taste in that time over
 
04:42:45.270 --> 04:42:45.280 align:start position:0%
what a lot of this law and the rules has
 
04:42:48.830 --> 04:42:48.840 align:start position:0%
meant on the ground uh but going back to
 
04:42:52.030 --> 04:42:52.040 align:start position:0%
2009 to 2013 I was advocating for the
 
04:42:54.310 --> 04:42:54.320 align:start position:0%
medical canvas law which included this
 
04:42:57.470 --> 04:42:57.480 align:start position:0%
nonprofit requirement why did we include
 
04:42:59.150 --> 04:42:59.160 align:start position:0%
the nonprofit requirement I think it's
 
04:43:01.390 --> 04:43:01.400 align:start position:0%
worth spending just a minute to answer
 
04:43:05.350 --> 04:43:05.360 align:start position:0%
that the goals of that bill first and
 
04:43:08.190 --> 04:43:08.200 align:start position:0%
foremost it was to protect patients from
 
04:43:10.470 --> 04:43:10.480 align:start position:0%
arrest because cannabis possession was
 
04:43:12.670 --> 04:43:12.680 align:start position:0%
still a crime crime in New
 
04:43:14.708 --> 04:43:14.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we would have done as
 
04:43:17.150 --> 04:43:17.160 align:start position:0%
advocates anything and compromised just
 
04:43:19.948 --> 04:43:19.958 align:start position:0%
about any other aspect of the policy to
 
04:43:22.030 --> 04:43:22.040 align:start position:0%
get patients their cards so they could
 
04:43:23.830 --> 04:43:23.840 align:start position:0%
be protected from arrests that was by
 
04:43:26.230 --> 04:43:26.240 align:start position:0%
far the most important thing to people
 
04:43:27.708 --> 04:43:27.718 align:start position:0%
who were testifying in this committee I
 
04:43:29.110 --> 04:43:29.120 align:start position:0%
think it was the most important thing to
 
04:43:31.030 --> 04:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
the members of the committee back
 
04:43:34.150 --> 04:43:34.160 align:start position:0%
then the other aspect was establishing
 
04:43:37.390 --> 04:43:37.400 align:start position:0%
safe legal access to cannabis which we
 
04:43:39.030 --> 04:43:39.040 align:start position:0%
attempted to do through hom grow and a
 
04:43:41.470 --> 04:43:41.480 align:start position:0%
couple of bills those were rejected Bill
 
04:43:43.868 --> 04:43:43.878 align:start position:0%
we ultimately ended up passing kept hom
 
04:43:46.948 --> 04:43:46.958 align:start position:0%
grow a crime and created these nonprofit
 
04:43:48.948 --> 04:43:48.958 align:start position:0%
dispensaries at the same time we were
 
04:43:51.510 --> 04:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
advocating for protecting patients from
 
04:43:54.070 --> 04:43:54.080 align:start position:0%
arrest and safe legal access our
 
04:43:57.190 --> 04:43:57.200 align:start position:0%
opponents were fixated mostly on one
 
04:43:59.830 --> 04:43:59.840 align:start position:0%
talking point and it was this isn't
 
04:44:01.868 --> 04:44:01.878 align:start position:0%
actually about helping patients this is
 
04:44:03.550 --> 04:44:03.560 align:start position:0%
an effort to create the next big
 
04:44:06.190 --> 04:44:06.200 align:start position:0%
marijuana or the next big tobacco that
 
04:44:08.510 --> 04:44:08.520 align:start position:0%
was the tagline of an organization
 
04:44:09.830 --> 04:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
you've actually heard from their instate
 
04:44:11.868 --> 04:44:11.878 align:start position:0%
affiliate a few times today project Sam
 
04:44:13.708 --> 04:44:13.718 align:start position:0%
is the name of the National Organization
 
04:44:16.910 --> 04:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
and they popularize this talking point
 
04:44:19.708 --> 04:44:19.718 align:start position:0%
it's about creating the next big tobacco
 
04:44:23.110 --> 04:44:23.120 align:start position:0%
it's not about helping sick people so
 
04:44:26.070 --> 04:44:26.080 align:start position:0%
long story short it passed
 
04:44:27.948 --> 04:44:27.958 align:start position:0%
and we were all going to see how it
 
04:44:29.830 --> 04:44:29.840 align:start position:0%
worked out and now we've seen how it
 
04:44:31.990 --> 04:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
worked out it's worked out very
 
04:44:34.788 --> 04:44:34.798 align:start position:0%
expensively for the atc's and for the
 
04:44:38.070 --> 04:44:38.080 align:start position:0%
patients of New Hampshire and state by
 
04:44:41.110 --> 04:44:41.120 align:start position:0%
state there were I found 10 states that
 
04:44:44.628 --> 04:44:44.638 align:start position:0%
had required nonprofit status initially
 
04:44:46.310 --> 04:44:46.320 align:start position:0%
Arizona is the only one I can find that
 
04:44:48.070 --> 04:44:48.080 align:start position:0%
still has it on the books and they've
 
04:44:51.750 --> 04:44:51.760 align:start position:0%
created a workaround so basically the
 
04:44:55.230 --> 04:44:55.240 align:start position:0%
states all realized that this was
 
04:44:57.310 --> 04:44:57.320 align:start position:0%
costing the companies more that were
 
04:45:00.948 --> 04:45:00.958 align:start position:0%
trying to provide access to patients and
 
04:45:04.350 --> 04:45:04.360 align:start position:0%
one by one they eliminated those
 
04:45:04.360 --> 04:45:06.390 align:start position:0%
one by one they eliminated those
requirements

04:45:06.390 --> 04:45:06.400 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
04:45:10.110 --> 04:45:10.120 align:start position:0%
um want to also comment on the the loan
 
04:45:13.270 --> 04:45:13.280 align:start position:0%
issue because what we have found and I
 
04:45:16.510 --> 04:45:16.520 align:start position:0%
have this from our our CEO if you want
 
04:45:18.510 --> 04:45:18.520 align:start position:0%
to get into the Weeds on these things we
 
04:45:20.670 --> 04:45:20.680 align:start position:0%
would be happy to talk to you for hours
 
04:45:22.190 --> 04:45:22.200 align:start position:0%
really as much detail as you want but
 
04:45:24.110 --> 04:45:24.120 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to keep it as high level as
 
04:45:26.550 --> 04:45:26.560 align:start position:0%
possible it's hard to get a loan too
 
04:45:28.788 --> 04:45:28.798 align:start position:0%
it's not just Capital when we go to get
 
04:45:31.868 --> 04:45:31.878 align:start position:0%
a loan they want collateral for the loan
 
04:45:34.030 --> 04:45:34.040 align:start position:0%
we don't own anything we're a nonprofit
 
04:45:36.230 --> 04:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
so that right
 
04:45:38.830 --> 04:45:38.840 align:start position:0%
there even the loans we can get if we
 
04:45:42.350 --> 04:45:42.360 align:start position:0%
can get them are at exorbitant ratees
 
04:45:43.868 --> 04:45:43.878 align:start position:0%
this is just something that is added
 
04:45:47.670 --> 04:45:47.680 align:start position:0%
costs at every level of the business
 
04:45:50.510 --> 04:45:50.520 align:start position:0%
from startup to present it continues to
 
04:45:52.990 --> 04:45:53.000 align:start position:0%
add costs and it will continue to add
 
04:45:56.190 --> 04:45:56.200 align:start position:0%
costs uh until it's changed if
 
04:45:58.550 --> 04:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
nonprofits are the best way to make
 
04:46:00.910 --> 04:46:00.920 align:start position:0%
important goods available affordably to
 
04:46:03.030 --> 04:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
the population I'd suggest that we would
 
04:46:05.590 --> 04:46:05.600 align:start position:0%
have nonprofit grocery stores we would
 
04:46:07.788 --> 04:46:07.798 align:start position:0%
have nonprofit box stores we would have
 
04:46:11.270 --> 04:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
nonprofit manufacturing companies and
 
04:46:14.190 --> 04:46:14.200 align:start position:0%
instead we we feel like a unicorn like
 
04:46:16.230 --> 04:46:16.240 align:start position:0%
we're a company that manufactures and
 
04:46:19.230 --> 04:46:19.240 align:start position:0%
sells products but we're not allowed to
 
04:46:21.430 --> 04:46:21.440 align:start position:0%
operate like a normal business and we
 
04:46:23.430 --> 04:46:23.440 align:start position:0%
have to find a workaround for literally
 
04:46:25.430 --> 04:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
everything and all of those workarounds
 
04:46:29.150 --> 04:46:29.160 align:start position:0%
are expensive so I'll stop there happy
 
04:46:31.390 --> 04:46:31.400 align:start position:0%
to get in the weeds if you like thank
 
04:46:33.910 --> 04:46:33.920 align:start position:0%
