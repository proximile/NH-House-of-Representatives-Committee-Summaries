i see you in other questions but i do
 
00:12:58.710 --> 00:12:58.720 align:start position:0%
have one more i just thought of uh it's

not required
 
00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:00.870 align:start position:0%

indication what they're looking for for

the girl scout seal um

looking for but it would most likely be
 
00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
a simple design of like the girl scout
 
00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:17.829 align:start position:0%

i'm a painter an artist an art
 
01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:33.510 align:start position:0%
i'm a painter an artist an art
psychotherapist

01:05:33.510 --> 01:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
psychotherapist
 
01:05:37.510 --> 01:05:37.520 align:start position:0%
a supporter of the arts in many ways
 
01:05:40.309 --> 01:05:40.319 align:start position:0%
one of my nashua constituents approached
 
01:05:40.319 --> 01:05:42.390 align:start position:0%
one of my nashua constituents approached
me

01:05:42.390 --> 01:05:42.400 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:05:44.230 --> 01:05:44.240 align:start position:0%
last year and said
 
01:05:47.270 --> 01:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
we should raise some money for the arts
 
01:05:49.750 --> 01:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
she wanted to hit the
 
01:05:51.750 --> 01:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
lottery money but i thought well that's
 
01:05:53.990 --> 01:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
probably a heavy lift because it's kind
 
01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:55.349 align:start position:0%
probably a heavy lift because it's kind
of

01:05:55.349 --> 01:05:55.359 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:05:57.270 --> 01:05:57.280 align:start position:0%
designated to education and i thought
 
01:05:59.430 --> 01:05:59.440 align:start position:0%
that would be difficult
 
01:06:02.950 --> 01:06:02.960 align:start position:0%
and then i looked up all of our vanity
 
01:06:05.109 --> 01:06:05.119 align:start position:0%
plates and i noticed that there wasn't
 
01:06:05.119 --> 01:06:06.069 align:start position:0%
plates and i noticed that there wasn't
one

01:06:06.069 --> 01:06:06.079 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:06:08.390 --> 01:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
for support the arts
 
01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:09.430 align:start position:0%
for support the arts
um

01:06:09.430 --> 01:06:09.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:11.190 --> 01:06:11.200 align:start position:0%
you know there's the veteran ones the
 
01:06:13.910 --> 01:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
the moose plate has done phenomenally
 
01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:15.430 align:start position:0%
the moose plate has done phenomenally
well

01:06:15.430 --> 01:06:15.440 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:06:18.789 --> 01:06:18.799 align:start position:0%
so i thought all right how would we
 
01:06:20.390 --> 01:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
raise money and
 
01:06:22.390 --> 01:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
who would
 
01:06:24.950 --> 01:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
manage it and then i thought of the new
 
01:06:27.430 --> 01:06:27.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire state council of the arts
 
01:06:30.870 --> 01:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
because they already have in place
 
01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:33.109 align:start position:0%
because they already have in place
um

01:06:33.109 --> 01:06:33.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:34.789 --> 01:06:34.799 align:start position:0%
staff that
 
01:06:37.829 --> 01:06:37.839 align:start position:0%
reads grants processes grants
 
01:06:40.630 --> 01:06:40.640 align:start position:0%
and and they award uh money to
 
01:06:44.230 --> 01:06:44.240 align:start position:0%
nonprofits so they are set up to handle
 
01:06:46.630 --> 01:06:46.640 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing they also have the
 
01:06:49.029 --> 01:06:49.039 align:start position:0%
bookkeeping that could handle that kind
 
01:06:51.829 --> 01:06:51.839 align:start position:0%
of thing and they're statewide whereas
 
01:06:51.839 --> 01:06:53.510 align:start position:0%
of thing and they're statewide whereas
my

01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
my
 
01:06:55.430 --> 01:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
constituent in nashua was kind of
 
01:06:58.150 --> 01:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
looking money just for nashua that's not
 
01:07:00.789 --> 01:07:00.799 align:start position:0%
really fair we want to we're a state
 
01:07:03.029 --> 01:07:03.039 align:start position:0%
you know i'm a state representative for
 
01:07:05.510 --> 01:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
the whole state not just for nashua
 
01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:08.150 align:start position:0%
the whole state not just for nashua
so

01:07:08.150 --> 01:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:10.710 --> 01:07:10.720 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:07:13.670 --> 01:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
a decal plate for the new hampshire
 
01:07:16.230 --> 01:07:16.240 align:start position:0%
state council of the arts would be kind
 
01:07:19.029 --> 01:07:19.039 align:start position:0%
of awesome it would be fair and it would
 
01:07:21.829 --> 01:07:21.839 align:start position:0%
be statewide
 
01:07:25.750 --> 01:07:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:31.029 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:07:31.029 --> 01:07:31.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:32.309 --> 01:07:32.319 align:start position:0%
sorry we're still getting used to these
 
01:07:33.750 --> 01:07:33.760 align:start position:0%
microphones yes i know so thank you for
 
01:07:36.470 --> 01:07:36.480 align:start position:0%
that um any questions from the committee
 
01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:38.549 align:start position:0%
that um any questions from the committee
representative

01:07:38.549 --> 01:07:38.559 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:07:40.069 --> 01:07:40.079 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
01:07:43.589 --> 01:07:43.599 align:start position:0%
representative um
 
01:07:47.510 --> 01:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to have you perhaps
 
01:07:50.150 --> 01:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit if possible about the
 
01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:51.589 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit if possible about the
amendment

01:07:51.589 --> 01:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:07:53.430 --> 01:07:53.440 align:start position:0%
because the amendment seems to be
 
01:07:55.109 --> 01:07:55.119 align:start position:0%
different from the original bill that we
 
01:07:56.870 --> 01:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
all received
 
01:07:58.710 --> 01:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
is there any way that we could
 
01:08:02.630 --> 01:08:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:05.190 --> 01:08:05.200 align:start position:0%
um i i
 
01:08:06.150 --> 01:08:06.160 align:start position:0%
i know
 
01:08:08.390 --> 01:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
well i left it to
 
01:08:10.549 --> 01:08:10.559 align:start position:0%
the legislative services to kind of put
 
01:08:13.029 --> 01:08:13.039 align:start position:0%
the correct amendment on and i realized
 
01:08:13.039 --> 01:08:13.990 align:start position:0%
the correct amendment on and i realized
that

01:08:13.990 --> 01:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:08:17.030 --> 01:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
normally you deal with just non-profits
 
01:08:18.309 --> 01:08:18.319 align:start position:0%
and so this is
 
01:08:20.630 --> 01:08:20.640 align:start position:0%
a little outside of that box because
 
01:08:23.590 --> 01:08:23.600 align:start position:0%
it's a state agency but i was thinking
 
01:08:27.669 --> 01:08:27.679 align:start position:0%
unlike other state agencies this one
 
01:08:30.390 --> 01:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
is able to take donations they currently
 
01:08:33.829 --> 01:08:33.839 align:start position:0%
already do take donations but any money
 
01:08:35.829 --> 01:08:35.839 align:start position:0%
that they would raise from this decal
 
01:08:40.709 --> 01:08:40.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:40.719 --> 01:08:41.430 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:08:41.430 --> 01:08:41.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:08:44.470 --> 01:08:44.480 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question
 
01:08:46.390 --> 01:08:46.400 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to clarify for the
 
01:08:48.789 --> 01:08:48.799 align:start position:0%
committee that the original bill that
 
01:08:50.470 --> 01:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
brings up a whole new section called
 
01:08:53.110 --> 01:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
hashtag license plates is no longer no
 
01:08:55.590 --> 01:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
longer in play and that the entire bill
 
01:08:56.550 --> 01:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
has been
 
01:08:58.470 --> 01:08:58.480 align:start position:0%
completely i'm looking at mr oberdink in
 
01:09:00.550 --> 01:09:00.560 align:start position:0%
the back making sure he knows this
 
01:09:02.470 --> 01:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
and the new amendment
 
01:09:05.269 --> 01:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
entirely replaces the bill yes that is
 
01:09:06.630 --> 01:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
correct um
 
01:09:09.189 --> 01:09:09.199 align:start position:0%
it was my first time writing a bill and
 
01:09:12.630 --> 01:09:12.640 align:start position:0%
i believe it was my ols person's also
 
01:09:15.189 --> 01:09:15.199 align:start position:0%
first time writing a bill so it's not as
 
01:09:16.870 --> 01:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
tidy as as
 
01:09:18.309 --> 01:09:18.319 align:start position:0%
it ended up
 
01:09:18.319 --> 01:09:19.189 align:start position:0%
it ended up
so

01:09:19.189 --> 01:09:19.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:09:21.349 --> 01:09:21.359 align:start position:0%
these two amendments would
 
01:09:24.709 --> 01:09:24.719 align:start position:0%
completely replace the first bill and um
 
01:09:27.349 --> 01:09:27.359 align:start position:0%
the office
 
01:09:29.749 --> 01:09:29.759 align:start position:0%
the financial office couldn't write me
 
01:09:33.349 --> 01:09:33.359 align:start position:0%
an amendment but he was able to write
 
01:09:35.749 --> 01:09:35.759 align:start position:0%
that this would fall under the 10 000 or
 
01:09:38.309 --> 01:09:38.319 align:start position:0%
less category because
 
01:09:41.030 --> 01:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
you know nobody wants to approve a 250
 
01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:42.149 align:start position:0%
you know nobody wants to approve a 250
000

01:09:42.149 --> 01:09:42.159 align:start position:0%
000
 
01:09:45.349 --> 01:09:45.359 align:start position:0%
uh creation of a new plate so that is
 
01:09:47.590 --> 01:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
off the table thanks thank you thank you
 
01:09:48.870 --> 01:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question thank you
 
01:09:50.309 --> 01:09:50.319 align:start position:0%
representative and
 
01:09:51.669 --> 01:09:51.679 align:start position:0%
that those were the issues and i do
 
01:09:53.669 --> 01:09:53.679 align:start position:0%
appreciate it we just have
 
01:09:55.910 --> 01:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
we just have given a copy of that to mr
 
01:09:58.390 --> 01:09:58.400 align:start position:0%
oberdenk too from dmv okay um so
 
01:10:01.189 --> 01:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
hopefully it'll make things much easier
 
01:10:04.550 --> 01:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
01:10:06.390 --> 01:10:06.400 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much
 
01:10:08.709 --> 01:10:08.719 align:start position:0%
so i'm sorry miss knight klein klein
 
01:10:11.590 --> 01:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
knight i'm sorry i hate to be a pain um
 
01:10:17.189 --> 01:10:17.199 align:start position:0%
as a sub especially um is this a 501 c 3
 
01:10:17.199 --> 01:10:18.550 align:start position:0%
as a sub especially um is this a 501 c 3
organization

01:10:18.550 --> 01:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
organization
 
01:10:20.790 --> 01:10:20.800 align:start position:0%
or is it for profit
 
01:10:22.390 --> 01:10:22.400 align:start position:0%
right even though it says non-profit i
 
01:10:24.630 --> 01:10:24.640 align:start position:0%
think it's neither because it's a state
 
01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:26.310 align:start position:0%
think it's neither because it's a state
agency

01:10:26.310 --> 01:10:26.320 align:start position:0%
agency
 
01:10:28.550 --> 01:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
so that's why it's a little outside of
 
01:10:32.070 --> 01:10:32.080 align:start position:0%
your usual uh purview i think is the
 
01:10:34.790 --> 01:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:36.310 --> 01:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:10:38.229 --> 01:10:38.239 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm so sorry mr chair i have two
 
01:10:41.030 --> 01:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
more questions has this has a state
 
01:10:42.870 --> 01:10:42.880 align:start position:0%
agency done a decal
 
01:10:46.470 --> 01:10:46.480 align:start position:0%

01:10:58.870 --> 01:10:58.880 align:start position:0%
and even with the amendment i would
 
01:11:00.470 --> 01:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
still have to say we'll probably have to
 
01:11:01.910 --> 01:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
do some more looking into this to make
 
01:11:04.229 --> 01:11:04.239 align:start position:0%
sure that it's thorough enough to
 
01:11:05.590 --> 01:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
include because that was going to bring
 
01:11:07.030 --> 01:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
me to my next question
 
01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:07.990 align:start position:0%
me to my next question
um

01:11:07.990 --> 01:11:08.000 align:start position:0%

that mean and where is that exactly
 
01:11:17.510 --> 01:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
going to go
 
01:11:20.390 --> 01:11:20.400 align:start position:0%
um that's not in the bill but that's the
 
01:11:22.229 --> 01:11:22.239 align:start position:0%
amendment sorry
 
01:11:24.830 --> 01:11:24.840 align:start position:0%

a wellness program um so there's a lot
 
01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:13.189 align:start position:0%
a wellness program um so there's a lot
of

01:13:13.189 --> 01:13:13.199 align:start position:0%

alzheimer's and their caregivers in art
 
01:13:34.229 --> 01:13:34.239 align:start position:0%
looking and aren't making kind of
 
01:13:37.110 --> 01:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
activities so these are the kind of
 
01:13:38.709 --> 01:13:38.719 align:start position:0%
mental health
 
01:13:41.030 --> 01:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
and wellness programs that the state
 
01:13:44.070 --> 01:13:44.080 align:start position:0%
council for the arts and others
 
01:13:47.270 --> 01:13:47.280 align:start position:0%
also fund does that answer your question
 
01:13:49.110 --> 01:13:49.120 align:start position:0%
representative just
 
01:13:51.030 --> 01:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
last question i promise
 
01:13:54.630 --> 01:13:54.640 align:start position:0%
um is it your intent that these proceeds
 
01:13:55.910 --> 01:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
go to
 
01:13:57.350 --> 01:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
uh funding
 
01:14:00.470 --> 01:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
our mental health purposes specifically
 
01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:01.669 align:start position:0%
our mental health purposes specifically
or

01:14:01.669 --> 01:14:01.679 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:14:04.630 --> 01:14:04.640 align:start position:0%
or as the prime sponsor would you
 
01:14:08.070 --> 01:14:08.080 align:start position:0%
be open to having them put wherever that
 
01:14:10.310 --> 01:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
they decide yes i didn't want to specify
 
01:14:13.030 --> 01:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
anything that would in any way
 
01:14:15.590 --> 01:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
profit myself so i'm i'm hands off on
 
01:14:18.070 --> 01:14:18.080 align:start position:0%
this what whatever the uh state council
 
01:14:20.550 --> 01:14:20.560 align:start position:0%
for the arts chooses to grant
 
01:14:24.229 --> 01:14:24.239 align:start position:0%
in their current grant um
 
01:14:26.229 --> 01:14:26.239 align:start position:0%
applications that's up to them
 
01:14:27.910 --> 01:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
thank you so much representative you're
 
01:14:29.830 --> 01:14:29.840 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you for your question any
 
01:14:30.870 --> 01:14:30.880 align:start position:0%
other further questions from the
 
01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:32.790 align:start position:0%
other further questions from the
committee

01:14:32.790 --> 01:14:32.800 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:14:33.590 --> 01:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:34.870 align:start position:0%
all right
um

01:14:34.870 --> 01:14:34.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:36.709 --> 01:14:36.719 align:start position:0%
and again we've got two issues here one
 
01:14:38.149 --> 01:14:38.159 align:start position:0%
the policy and i don't think anybody is
 
01:14:40.310 --> 01:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
opposed to that but even just reading
 
01:14:41.830 --> 01:14:41.840 align:start position:0%
the amendment quickly looks like there
 
01:14:43.430 --> 01:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
still may be some technical changes that
 
01:14:45.189 --> 01:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
need to happen but we'll take care of
 
01:14:47.030 --> 01:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
that if we can cross the first bridge
 
01:14:49.750 --> 01:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
okay so i'm i'm available for any more
 
01:14:51.430 --> 01:14:51.440 align:start position:0%

01:15:13.910 --> 01:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chairman and members of
 
01:15:15.510 --> 01:15:15.520 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record my name is
 
01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:16.390 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record my name is
jeff

01:15:16.390 --> 01:15:16.400 align:start position:0%
jeff
 
01:15:17.669 --> 01:15:17.679 align:start position:0%
obernank and i'm here to provide
 
01:15:19.270 --> 01:15:19.280 align:start position:0%
testimony on behalf of the division of
 
01:15:21.110 --> 01:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
motor vehicles today and i must admit in
 
01:15:23.110 --> 01:15:23.120 align:start position:0%
the last five minutes my testimony has
 
01:15:26.870 --> 01:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
changed uh version 2.0 the bill looks a
 
01:15:29.510 --> 01:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
lot better than version 1.0 getting rid
 
01:15:31.510 --> 01:15:31.520 align:start position:0%
of hashtag alleviates a lot of stress
 
01:15:33.669 --> 01:15:33.679 align:start position:0%
for us
 
01:15:33.679 --> 01:15:34.950 align:start position:0%
for us
and

01:15:34.950 --> 01:15:34.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:15:36.709 --> 01:15:36.719 align:start position:0%
the only thing that i would oppose going
 
01:15:38.790 --> 01:15:38.800 align:start position:0%
forward mr chairman and respectfully i
 
01:15:40.070 --> 01:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
think you mentioned it that it still
 
01:15:41.750 --> 01:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
needs a little bit of work
 
01:15:44.149 --> 01:15:44.159 align:start position:0%
to make sure that it fits into
 
01:15:46.550 --> 01:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
the current regulation
 
01:15:48.310 --> 01:15:48.320 align:start position:0%
having said that thank you for getting
 
01:15:50.950 --> 01:15:50.960 align:start position:0%
rid of hashtag whoever did that
 
01:15:52.470 --> 01:15:52.480 align:start position:0%
and and that'll conclude my testimony if
 
01:15:54.229 --> 01:15:54.239 align:start position:0%
anybody has any questions
 
01:15:55.510 --> 01:15:55.520 align:start position:0%
all right thank you sir we maybe reach
 
01:15:56.709 --> 01:15:56.719 align:start position:0%
out to you any questions from the
 
01:15:56.719 --> 01:15:58.270 align:start position:0%
out to you any questions from the
committee

01:15:58.270 --> 01:15:58.280 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:15:58.280 --> 01:15:59.990 align:start position:0%
committee
representative

01:15:59.990 --> 01:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:16:01.430 --> 01:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much mr
 
01:16:03.430 --> 01:16:03.440 align:start position:0%
obernink um
 
01:16:04.709 --> 01:16:04.719 align:start position:0%
do you
 
01:16:06.709 --> 01:16:06.719 align:start position:0%
see any um
 
01:16:08.470 --> 01:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
initial problems
 
01:16:10.950 --> 01:16:10.960 align:start position:0%
with including a state agency
 
01:16:12.630 --> 01:16:12.640 align:start position:0%
as like opening that door i think we're
 
01:16:14.149 --> 01:16:14.159 align:start position:0%
all worried about opening the door to
 
01:16:16.070 --> 01:16:16.080 align:start position:0%
another category
 
01:16:17.669 --> 01:16:17.679 align:start position:0%
that's a great question uh
 
01:16:18.950 --> 01:16:18.960 align:start position:0%
representative talarski i think that
 
01:16:20.390 --> 01:16:20.400 align:start position:0%
door has already been opened by allowing
 
01:16:22.390 --> 01:16:22.400 align:start position:0%
the fire service to do something
 
01:16:23.830 --> 01:16:23.840 align:start position:0%
so i think this just opens it up a
 
01:16:26.550 --> 01:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
little bit wider
 
01:16:27.910 --> 01:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:16:30.310 --> 01:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
01:16:34.470 --> 01:16:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:37.110 --> 01:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
last call anybody else wish to speak to
 
01:16:40.470 --> 01:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
house bill 1492.

unfortunately it may be an unenrolled
 
01:25:59.430 --> 01:25:59.440 align:start position:0%
bill amendment to straighten out the
 
01:26:01.189 --> 01:26:01.199 align:start position:0%
numbering yeah i just want to maybe we
 
01:26:03.189 --> 01:26:03.199 align:start position:0%
could keep it in mind i'll verify that
 
01:26:05.030 --> 01:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
if we have to reopen it with it with an
 
01:26:07.030 --> 01:26:07.040 align:start position:0%
amendment we will but we'll reconsider
 
01:26:08.470 --> 01:26:08.480 align:start position:0%
it we will but i think we'll be all
 
01:26:09.750 --> 01:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
right going that route just wanted to
 
01:26:12.629 --> 01:26:12.639 align:start position:0%

good morning good morning mr chair good
 
01:36:07.270 --> 01:36:07.280 align:start position:0%
morning community members thank you for
 
01:36:09.590 --> 01:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
taking my testimony today this is a
 
01:36:11.990 --> 01:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
pretty simple one sentence bill making
 
01:36:13.669 --> 01:36:13.679 align:start position:0%
changes to two characters in one
 
01:36:13.679 --> 01:36:14.790 align:start position:0%
changes to two characters in one
sentence

01:36:14.790 --> 01:36:14.800 align:start position:0%
sentence
 
01:36:16.149 --> 01:36:16.159 align:start position:0%
this bill is being brought at the
 
01:36:18.550 --> 01:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
request of my selectmen i live in a late
 
01:36:18.560 --> 01:36:19.990 align:start position:0%
request of my selectmen i live in a late
community

01:36:19.990 --> 01:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
community
 
01:36:22.070 --> 01:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
what we're seeing around the state is in
 
01:36:25.030 --> 01:36:25.040 align:start position:0%
our lakeside communities
 
01:36:26.629 --> 01:36:26.639 align:start position:0%
urban density is starting to happen
 
01:36:28.470 --> 01:36:28.480 align:start position:0%
we're having really tight small property
 
01:36:30.790 --> 01:36:30.800 align:start position:0%
lands lots of houses
 
01:36:32.790 --> 01:36:32.800 align:start position:0%
and in this case lots of houses
 
01:36:34.310 --> 01:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
especially during the summer time means
 
01:36:36.390 --> 01:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
lots of kids playing basketball in the
 
01:36:38.709 --> 01:36:38.719 align:start position:0%
road doing other things
 
01:36:40.470 --> 01:36:40.480 align:start position:0%
and we had a problem in our community
 
01:36:42.709 --> 01:36:42.719 align:start position:0%
where again one of our our dense
 
01:36:45.910 --> 01:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
population areas um the speed limit was
 
01:36:47.750 --> 01:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
a problem for the citizens going through
 
01:36:49.189 --> 01:36:49.199 align:start position:0%
there we're getting numerous complaints
 
01:36:51.750 --> 01:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
from to the police about it
 
01:36:53.109 --> 01:36:53.119 align:start position:0%
and what the selectmen when they did the
 
01:36:54.709 --> 01:36:54.719 align:start position:0%
research found that the lowest they
 
01:36:56.790 --> 01:36:56.800 align:start position:0%
could set in this urban area was a 25
 
01:36:59.030 --> 01:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
mile an hour speed limit um which even
 
01:37:01.669 --> 01:37:01.679 align:start position:0%
that was too fast for what was going on
 
01:37:03.910 --> 01:37:03.920 align:start position:0%
so what this bill just does is allows in
 
01:37:05.910 --> 01:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
certain in circumstances that's that's
 
01:37:07.910 --> 01:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
selectmen deemed appropriate they can
 
01:37:09.590 --> 01:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
lower the speed limit down to 10 miles
 
01:37:11.910 --> 01:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
an hour and again i don't see selectmen
 
01:37:13.590 --> 01:37:13.600 align:start position:0%
abusing this process it would still go
 
01:37:15.990 --> 01:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
through the normal process of slowing of
 
01:37:17.270 --> 01:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
speed limit posting which in our
 
01:37:19.270 --> 01:37:19.280 align:start position:0%
community is is public hearings when
 
01:37:20.470 --> 01:37:20.480 align:start position:0%
they're going to change a speed zone
 
01:37:22.790 --> 01:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
they have a public hearing about it
 
01:37:24.390 --> 01:37:24.400 align:start position:0%
and it would allow them to be able to
 
01:37:27.189 --> 01:37:27.199 align:start position:0%
act in these hot more dense areas to be
 
01:37:28.790 --> 01:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
able to lower the speed limit to a more
 
01:37:30.229 --> 01:37:30.239 align:start position:0%
safe manner
 
01:37:32.070 --> 01:37:32.080 align:start position:0%
so that we don't put
 
01:37:33.830 --> 01:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
people at risk that's it pretty
 
01:37:35.990 --> 01:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
straightforward thank you uh before we
 
01:37:38.070 --> 01:37:38.080 align:start position:0%
open up the committee we have seen this
 
01:37:39.350 --> 01:37:39.360 align:start position:0%
bill before
 
01:37:41.990 --> 01:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
at least twice i believe um i believe in
 
01:37:43.910 --> 01:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
current statute there is the ability for
 
01:37:46.870 --> 01:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
a town or municipality to apply with the
 
01:37:49.350 --> 01:37:49.360 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the department some
 
01:37:51.669 --> 01:37:51.679 align:start position:0%
relief on the 25 do you know if your
 
01:37:53.750 --> 01:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
select board has done that yet they were
 
01:37:57.189 --> 01:37:57.199 align:start position:0%
aware of the process um again they
 
01:37:59.270 --> 01:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
they were they were pursuing it but
 
01:38:00.470 --> 01:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
again it was an
 
01:38:02.070 --> 01:38:02.080 align:start position:0%
onerous process for lack of a better
 
01:38:03.990 --> 01:38:04.000 align:start position:0%
phrase of having to to get the
 
01:38:06.629 --> 01:38:06.639 align:start position:0%
permission and go to seek outside the
 
01:38:08.470 --> 01:38:08.480 align:start position:0%
town someone else's permission to lower
 
01:38:11.750 --> 01:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
the speed in your own town um and so
 
01:38:14.310 --> 01:38:14.320 align:start position:0%
they felt that was onerous and and again
 
01:38:15.830 --> 01:38:15.840 align:start position:0%
the selectmen asked me to bring forward
 
01:38:17.750 --> 01:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
this bill because that the talent should
 
01:38:19.189 --> 01:38:19.199 align:start position:0%
be able to set the speed limit within
 
01:38:21.189 --> 01:38:21.199 align:start position:0%
its own confines without having to run
 
01:38:22.950 --> 01:38:22.960 align:start position:0%
the department of transportation ask
 
01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:24.709 align:start position:0%
the department of transportation ask
permission

01:38:24.709 --> 01:38:24.719 align:start position:0%
permission
 
01:38:24.719 --> 01:38:26.790 align:start position:0%
permission
um

01:38:26.790 --> 01:38:26.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:27.750 --> 01:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
01:38:27.760 --> 01:38:33.350 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
representative

01:38:33.350 --> 01:38:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:35.910 --> 01:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um so
 
01:38:35.920 --> 01:38:36.709 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um so
just

01:38:36.709 --> 01:38:36.719 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:38:38.870 --> 01:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
hypothetically if my town was to adopt
 
01:38:38.880 --> 01:38:39.669 align:start position:0%
hypothetically if my town was to adopt
this

01:38:39.669 --> 01:38:39.679 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:38:42.310 --> 01:38:42.320 align:start position:0%
could they set the main street to 10 but
 
01:38:44.790 --> 01:38:44.800 align:start position:0%
still allow 25 in other urban business
 
01:38:44.800 --> 01:38:45.830 align:start position:0%
still allow 25 in other urban business
areas

01:38:45.830 --> 01:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
areas
 
01:38:47.750 --> 01:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
correct so this is a per street basis
 
01:38:49.590 --> 01:38:49.600 align:start position:0%
like any other speed limit zone so you
 
01:38:51.750 --> 01:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
have a maximum you know two lane divided
 
01:38:54.070 --> 01:38:54.080 align:start position:0%
highways i think 45 miles is the maximum
 
01:38:56.550 --> 01:38:56.560 align:start position:0%
speed limit allowed and so uh the
 
01:38:59.669 --> 01:38:59.679 align:start position:0%
interstate's 70 right and so by statute
 
01:39:01.189 --> 01:39:01.199 align:start position:0%
right so there are certain speed zone
 
01:39:03.510 --> 01:39:03.520 align:start position:0%
zones that have prima facie speed limit
 
01:39:05.350 --> 01:39:05.360 align:start position:0%
laws um
 
01:39:07.430 --> 01:39:07.440 align:start position:0%
this the primary facial speed limit law
 
01:39:09.189 --> 01:39:09.199 align:start position:0%
here is 25 which means that if they
 
01:39:11.189 --> 01:39:11.199 align:start position:0%
don't post a sign then they can go up to
 
01:39:13.669 --> 01:39:13.679 align:start position:0%
25 miles an hour i'm here if they post a
 
01:39:15.189 --> 01:39:15.199 align:start position:0%
sign if there's no posted sign it's
 
01:39:17.750 --> 01:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
assumed 10. um so
 
01:39:17.760 --> 01:39:19.669 align:start position:0%
assumed 10. um so
um

01:39:19.669 --> 01:39:19.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:20.550 --> 01:39:20.560 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if that answered your
 
01:39:21.910 --> 01:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
question but yes they can set a
 
01:39:23.270 --> 01:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
differential you can have one section of
 
01:39:24.870 --> 01:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
road at one speed another section road
 
01:39:27.189 --> 01:39:27.199 align:start position:0%
with another speed up to 25 mile up to
 
01:39:29.030 --> 01:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
whatever your normal is
 
01:39:30.950 --> 01:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
because this is a not less than it's not
 
01:39:33.430 --> 01:39:33.440 align:start position:0%
not a more than so
 
01:39:35.030 --> 01:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
01:39:35.040 --> 01:39:36.390 align:start position:0%
further questions
representative

01:39:36.390 --> 01:39:36.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:39:37.830 --> 01:39:37.840 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for taking my question i
 
01:39:38.950 --> 01:39:38.960 align:start position:0%
think you just answered this so this
 
01:39:38.960 --> 01:39:39.750 align:start position:0%
think you just answered this so this
would

01:39:39.750 --> 01:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:39:41.830 --> 01:39:41.840 align:start position:0%
they're not they they cannot raise the
 
01:39:44.229 --> 01:39:44.239 align:start position:0%
speed limit correct only lower it if
 
01:39:46.390 --> 01:39:46.400 align:start position:0%
this were to pass correct this is a not
 
01:39:49.109 --> 01:39:49.119 align:start position:0%
less than bill so in other words i can't
 
01:39:51.350 --> 01:39:51.360 align:start position:0%
go less than 10 miles an hour but if 35
 
01:39:54.870 --> 01:39:54.880 align:start position:0%
is appropriate i can set it at 35.
 
01:39:57.270 --> 01:39:57.280 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
01:40:00.950 --> 01:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:02.070 --> 01:40:02.080 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
01:40:04.870 --> 01:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
question um it's quite a significant
 
01:40:07.030 --> 01:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
jump in my mind picturing yourself in a
 
01:40:09.830 --> 01:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
vehicle to go from 25 to 10. um is there
 
01:40:12.790 --> 01:40:12.800 align:start position:0%
any logic to why they went so low is
 
01:40:15.669 --> 01:40:15.679 align:start position:0%
15 even 15 occasionally you'll see 15 in
 
01:40:17.910 --> 01:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
some parking lot or whatever
 
01:40:19.510 --> 01:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
is there a reason why they went so
 
01:40:21.189 --> 01:40:21.199 align:start position:0%
extremely low to 10
 
01:40:22.950 --> 01:40:22.960 align:start position:0%
sure so the answer was again because
 
01:40:24.390 --> 01:40:24.400 align:start position:0%
it's not a less than so they could
 
01:40:26.149 --> 01:40:26.159 align:start position:0%
choose 15 if they wanted if this bill
 
01:40:28.310 --> 01:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
was to pass they don't have to go to 10
 
01:40:28.320 --> 01:40:29.270 align:start position:0%
was to pass they don't have to go to 10
but

01:40:29.270 --> 01:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:40:31.750 --> 01:40:31.760 align:start position:0%
they felt that again i think you'll see
 
01:40:34.310 --> 01:40:34.320 align:start position:0%
this in a lot of lakefront communities
 
01:40:36.310 --> 01:40:36.320 align:start position:0%
where you have really dense populations
 
01:40:37.910 --> 01:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
right against the lake 10th of an acre
 
01:40:40.709 --> 01:40:40.719 align:start position:0%
lots house after house after house and
 
01:40:43.510 --> 01:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
in that area um a 10 mile an hour zone
 
01:40:44.790 --> 01:40:44.800 align:start position:0%
may be appropriate
 
01:40:48.070 --> 01:40:48.080 align:start position:0%
um and so uh that's the reason why the
 
01:40:49.750 --> 01:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
selectman they i asked them what they
 
01:40:51.270 --> 01:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
wanted they came back with this number
 
01:40:53.270 --> 01:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
because of that dense population we only
 
01:40:54.950 --> 01:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
have one small section of road to be
 
01:40:56.550 --> 01:40:56.560 align:start position:0%
honest with you where this is really
 
01:40:59.109 --> 01:40:59.119 align:start position:0%
going to apply um but where we have
 
01:41:01.669 --> 01:41:01.679 align:start position:0%
really dense populations again house you
 
01:41:01.679 --> 01:41:02.470 align:start position:0%
really dense populations again house you
know

01:41:02.470 --> 01:41:02.480 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:41:04.070 --> 01:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
you can watch what your dinner you can
 
01:41:05.669 --> 01:41:05.679 align:start position:0%
watch your neighbor's tv from your
 
01:41:07.270 --> 01:41:07.280 align:start position:0%
window right the houses are right next
 
01:41:08.870 --> 01:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
to each other and it's a really densely
 
01:41:11.669 --> 01:41:11.679 align:start position:0%
populated area along the lake and
 
01:41:13.189 --> 01:41:13.199 align:start position:0%
25 miles an hour which was the lowest
 
01:41:14.629 --> 01:41:14.639 align:start position:0%
speed limit they could go to was too
 
01:41:16.709 --> 01:41:16.719 align:start position:0%
much was was too fast
 
01:41:18.390 --> 01:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
they wanted to slow it down i don't
 
01:41:19.830 --> 01:41:19.840 align:start position:0%
think it's more than a tenth of a mile
 
01:41:22.950 --> 01:41:22.960 align:start position:0%
to a half to a quarter of a mile um
 
01:41:25.350 --> 01:41:25.360 align:start position:0%
stretch of road where it is so densely
 
01:41:28.790 --> 01:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
populated that 25 is too much
 
01:41:31.669 --> 01:41:31.679 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
01:41:31.679 --> 01:41:33.270 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee

01:41:33.270 --> 01:41:33.280 align:start position:0%
rumbo
 
01:41:34.950 --> 01:41:34.960 align:start position:0%
morning thank you for taking my question
 
01:41:36.870 --> 01:41:36.880 align:start position:0%
uh i'm just curious if you had any input
 
01:41:39.030 --> 01:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
from local law enforcement on if they
 
01:41:40.950 --> 01:41:40.960 align:start position:0%
were concerned about
 
01:41:43.189 --> 01:41:43.199 align:start position:0%
the dramatic drop changing um you know
 
01:41:44.550 --> 01:41:44.560 align:start position:0%
coming in from
 
01:41:46.149 --> 01:41:46.159 align:start position:0%
previous road or the beginning of the
 
01:41:48.229 --> 01:41:48.239 align:start position:0%
road the quick drop off and kind of
 
01:41:50.149 --> 01:41:50.159 align:start position:0%
extreme drop off and picking up again i
 
01:41:51.109 --> 01:41:51.119 align:start position:0%
know in other communities when there's
 
01:41:52.709 --> 01:41:52.719 align:start position:0%
been propositions for changing speed
 
01:41:53.990 --> 01:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
limits there's been
 
01:41:56.550 --> 01:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
sometimes concern about you know how how
 
01:41:58.390 --> 01:41:58.400 align:start position:0%
i guess it would be either from
 
01:42:00.629 --> 01:42:00.639 align:start position:0%
public works or police
 
01:42:02.629 --> 01:42:02.639 align:start position:0%
sure so i did speak to our police chief
 
01:42:04.550 --> 01:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
so i'm a former law enforcement officer
 
01:42:06.470 --> 01:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
myself for over a decade
 
01:42:08.470 --> 01:42:08.480 align:start position:0%
and and i did speak with our police
 
01:42:10.629 --> 01:42:10.639 align:start position:0%
chief he was not concerned about this um
 
01:42:13.030 --> 01:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
at all he felt again the the police the
 
01:42:14.550 --> 01:42:14.560 align:start position:0%
police chief felt this was reasonable
 
01:42:17.510 --> 01:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
for the conditions there um and that it
 
01:42:19.350 --> 01:42:19.360 align:start position:0%
was an appropriate change
 
01:42:21.590 --> 01:42:21.600 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions
 
01:42:23.750 --> 01:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
representative klein knight
 
01:42:25.590 --> 01:42:25.600 align:start position:0%
um thank you chairman thank you so much
 
01:42:27.510 --> 01:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
01:42:27.520 --> 01:42:28.790 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
um

01:42:28.790 --> 01:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:31.830 --> 01:42:31.840 align:start position:0%
there's no limit on the stretch of how
 
01:42:33.430 --> 01:42:33.440 align:start position:0%
long this could go could this
 
01:42:36.629 --> 01:42:36.639 align:start position:0%
potentially be any like how long is this
 
01:42:38.390 --> 01:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
stretch that you're speaking about and
 
01:42:39.910 --> 01:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
could this be
 
01:42:43.669 --> 01:42:43.679 align:start position:0%
for any length so again a lot it could
 
01:42:45.030 --> 01:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
be for any length so
 
01:42:47.109 --> 01:42:47.119 align:start position:0%
so again if the town feels
 
01:42:48.629 --> 01:42:48.639 align:start position:0%
uh that there's a stretch of road that's
 
01:42:51.030 --> 01:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
a mile and a half long and they want to
 
01:42:52.950 --> 01:42:52.960 align:start position:0%
they want to change the speed limit
 
01:42:54.709 --> 01:42:54.719 align:start position:0%
again in most towns at least in our town
 
01:42:56.149 --> 01:42:56.159 align:start position:0%
we have public hearings on those kind of
 
01:42:58.390 --> 01:42:58.400 align:start position:0%
changes so people are made aware of it
 
01:43:00.550 --> 01:43:00.560 align:start position:0%
they would have a public hearing on
 
01:43:02.390 --> 01:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
we're going to change this this this
 
01:43:04.070 --> 01:43:04.080 align:start position:0%
mile of road and the speed limits and
 
01:43:05.189 --> 01:43:05.199 align:start position:0%
the police department be involved
 
01:43:06.390 --> 01:43:06.400 align:start position:0%
department of transportation be involved
 
01:43:07.750 --> 01:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
the highway department be involved and
 
01:43:09.830 --> 01:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
come in and do it the problem here is
 
01:43:12.390 --> 01:43:12.400 align:start position:0%
that you can't go below 25 miles an hour
 
01:43:13.910 --> 01:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
right near stretches where they do want
 
01:43:15.910 --> 01:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
to go below 25 miles an hour but can't
 
01:43:17.270 --> 01:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
post and it wouldn't be legally
 
01:43:19.669 --> 01:43:19.679 align:start position:0%
enforceable if they did post so and the
 
01:43:22.149 --> 01:43:22.159 align:start position:0%
idea is to make it legally enforceable
 
01:43:24.629 --> 01:43:24.639 align:start position:0%
so one of the other well i'll leave it
 
01:43:25.510 --> 01:43:25.520 align:start position:0%
at that
 
01:43:26.870 --> 01:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions from the
 
01:43:26.880 --> 01:43:28.149 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions from the
committee

01:43:28.149 --> 01:43:28.159 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:43:31.669 --> 01:43:31.679 align:start position:0%
follow-up um thank you so much and um i
 
01:43:35.510 --> 01:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
i do like the intent um so i i apologize
 
01:43:36.790 --> 01:43:36.800 align:start position:0%
i'm not trying to
 
01:43:38.550 --> 01:43:38.560 align:start position:0%
put you through the ringer but um you
 
01:43:41.030 --> 01:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned having town meetings on this
 
01:43:43.669 --> 01:43:43.679 align:start position:0%
do you do they have to have a
 
01:43:46.070 --> 01:43:46.080 align:start position:0%
a town meeting if this is
 
01:43:49.750 --> 01:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
a state alteration law to speeding
 
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
or could the state without having a
 
01:43:53.430 --> 01:43:53.440 align:start position:0%
meeting just
 
01:43:56.310 --> 01:43:56.320 align:start position:0%
prove and enforce this
 
01:43:59.189 --> 01:43:59.199 align:start position:0%
so to answer your question is that the
 
01:44:00.870 --> 01:44:00.880 align:start position:0%
state law sets the minimums for the
 
01:44:00.880 --> 01:44:01.910 align:start position:0%
state law sets the minimums for the
community

01:44:01.910 --> 01:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
community
 
01:44:03.430 --> 01:44:03.440 align:start position:0%
and then the community implements from
 
01:44:04.870 --> 01:44:04.880 align:start position:0%
the minimum up
 
01:44:06.950 --> 01:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
so the community
 
01:44:08.310 --> 01:44:08.320 align:start position:0%
so in this road that i'm particularly
 
01:44:09.510 --> 01:44:09.520 align:start position:0%
talking about department of
 
01:44:11.189 --> 01:44:11.199 align:start position:0%
transportation couldn't walk in without
 
01:44:13.350 --> 01:44:13.360 align:start position:0%
the town's notice and say this is a town
 
01:44:14.629 --> 01:44:14.639 align:start position:0%
road but the state's going to set a new
 
01:44:16.470 --> 01:44:16.480 align:start position:0%
speed limit on it they can't do that
 
01:44:18.790 --> 01:44:18.800 align:start position:0%
because it's a town maintained road town
 
01:44:21.910 --> 01:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
regulated road and so um so to answer
 
01:44:24.629 --> 01:44:24.639 align:start position:0%
your question i think is no um but it's
 
01:44:27.669 --> 01:44:27.679 align:start position:0%
a it's a town activity um that isn't to
 
01:44:29.270 --> 01:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
say there aren't state roads that run
 
01:44:31.030 --> 01:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
through towns that you know you have
 
01:44:33.669 --> 01:44:33.679 align:start position:0%
your your different route 140s 132s and
 
01:44:33.679 --> 01:44:34.629 align:start position:0%
your your different route 140s 132s and
different

01:44:34.629 --> 01:44:34.639 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:44:36.149 --> 01:44:36.159 align:start position:0%
high state routes that run through towns
 
01:44:40.470 --> 01:44:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:41.590 --> 01:44:41.600 align:start position:0%
what are the questions representative
 
01:44:44.310 --> 01:44:44.320 align:start position:0%
rambo it may be a follow-up to nicole's
 
01:44:45.990 --> 01:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
actually but um
 
01:44:48.709 --> 01:44:48.719 align:start position:0%
to make sure i understand then if this
 
01:44:50.629 --> 01:44:50.639 align:start position:0%
were passed the town would still then
 
01:44:52.310 --> 01:44:52.320 align:start position:0%
have to potentially have a hearing at
 
01:44:53.750 --> 01:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
the town level
 
01:44:55.430 --> 01:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
for residents to put input whether they
 
01:44:57.350 --> 01:44:57.360 align:start position:0%
wanted to go down to 10 if it's at 25
 
01:44:58.629 --> 01:44:58.639 align:start position:0%
right now but they were permitted to go
 
01:44:59.669 --> 01:44:59.679 align:start position:0%
to 10 there would still have to be a
 
01:44:59.679 --> 01:45:00.709 align:start position:0%
to 10 there would still have to be a
local

01:45:00.709 --> 01:45:00.719 align:start position:0%
local
 
01:45:02.629 --> 01:45:02.639 align:start position:0%
hearing is that correct correct there's
 
01:45:04.470 --> 01:45:04.480 align:start position:0%
still local control local issues they
 
01:45:05.830 --> 01:45:05.840 align:start position:0%
would still have to have a process in
 
01:45:07.270 --> 01:45:07.280 align:start position:0%
place for lowering the speed limit it
 
01:45:08.790 --> 01:45:08.800 align:start position:0%
just gives them the options in these
 
01:45:10.470 --> 01:45:10.480 align:start position:0%
denser communities to be able to set a
 
01:45:12.470 --> 01:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
lower speed limit to where they think
 
01:45:14.310 --> 01:45:14.320 align:start position:0%
it's at risk for this citizens of that
 
01:45:14.320 --> 01:45:17.990 align:start position:0%
it's at risk for this citizens of that
area

01:45:17.990 --> 01:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:19.590 --> 01:45:19.600 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
01:45:23.270 --> 01:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:25.590 --> 01:45:25.600 align:start position:0%
next up chair recognizes and i apologize
 
01:45:27.430 --> 01:45:27.440 align:start position:0%
if i'm mispronouncing this is it match
 
01:45:27.440 --> 01:45:32.149 align:start position:0%
if i'm mispronouncing this is it match
grace

01:45:32.149 --> 01:45:32.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:34.950 --> 01:45:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:36.550 --> 01:45:36.560 align:start position:0%
just so it's on the record and h grades
 
01:45:37.590 --> 01:45:37.600 align:start position:0%
for the new hampshire municipal
 
01:45:40.229 --> 01:45:40.239 align:start position:0%
association we support this bill this is
 
01:45:43.109 --> 01:45:43.119 align:start position:0%
a widespread problem that representative
 
01:45:45.590 --> 01:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
lang has identified um it's not just the
 
01:45:48.070 --> 01:45:48.080 align:start position:0%
the lakes region but we hear from select
 
01:45:49.910 --> 01:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
boards across the state
 
01:45:52.550 --> 01:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
uh about particular circumstances where
 
01:45:53.430 --> 01:45:53.440 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:45:54.870 --> 01:45:54.880 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
01:45:57.750 --> 01:45:57.760 align:start position:0%
densely um built up area where there are
 
01:46:00.229 --> 01:46:00.239 align:start position:0%
lots of crosswalks and they're not good
 
01:46:01.830 --> 01:46:01.840 align:start position:0%
sight lines or
 
01:46:03.990 --> 01:46:04.000 align:start position:0%
you know uh elementary school or
 
01:46:05.430 --> 01:46:05.440 align:start position:0%
something like that where the kids are
 
01:46:07.830 --> 01:46:07.840 align:start position:0%
out close to the road and it's really is
 
01:46:10.070 --> 01:46:10.080 align:start position:0%
appropriate it really is a safety issue
 
01:46:12.229 --> 01:46:12.239 align:start position:0%
um they want to reduce the the speed
 
01:46:14.790 --> 01:46:14.800 align:start position:0%
limit in those situations
 
01:46:16.470 --> 01:46:16.480 align:start position:0%
unfortunately under the laws written
 
01:46:19.270 --> 01:46:19.280 align:start position:0%
they can't reduce it lower than than 25
 
01:46:21.910 --> 01:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
um so this would just modify it to 10
 
01:46:24.149 --> 01:46:24.159 align:start position:0%
and we would certainly support that and
 
01:46:26.950 --> 01:46:26.960 align:start position:0%
allow them and support the idea of
 
01:46:29.109 --> 01:46:29.119 align:start position:0%
giving local communities the flexibility
 
01:46:29.119 --> 01:46:29.990 align:start position:0%
giving local communities the flexibility
to

01:46:29.990 --> 01:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:46:32.149 --> 01:46:32.159 align:start position:0%
adjust the speed limits as appropriate
 
01:46:33.910 --> 01:46:33.920 align:start position:0%
for the particular circumstances that
 
01:46:35.189 --> 01:46:35.199 align:start position:0%
they're facing
 
01:46:38.070 --> 01:46:38.080 align:start position:0%
um in those cases
 
01:46:39.590 --> 01:46:39.600 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take questions all right
 
01:46:40.470 --> 01:46:40.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:46:42.390 --> 01:46:42.400 align:start position:0%
i won't bother asking the same question
 
01:46:43.910 --> 01:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
twice uh
 
01:46:45.830 --> 01:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
representative thompson
 
01:46:45.840 --> 01:46:46.629 align:start position:0%
representative thompson
um

01:46:46.629 --> 01:46:46.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:50.390 --> 01:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:53.750 --> 01:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
larger problem than than just uh
 
01:46:56.310 --> 01:46:56.320 align:start position:0%
representative langstown who's going to
 
01:46:58.310 --> 01:46:58.320 align:start position:0%
pay the bill
 
01:47:00.550 --> 01:47:00.560 align:start position:0%
for the for the new speed limit signs
 
01:47:00.560 --> 01:47:01.430 align:start position:0%
for the for the new speed limit signs
yeah

01:47:01.430 --> 01:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:47:02.709 --> 01:47:02.719 align:start position:0%
uh they would
 
01:47:06.629 --> 01:47:06.639 align:start position:0%
pay them through the regular process um
 
01:47:08.950 --> 01:47:08.960 align:start position:0%
this would modify that follow-up but it
 
01:47:11.189 --> 01:47:11.199 align:start position:0%
would be the town
 
01:47:13.030 --> 01:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
would be the town yeah okay on their
 
01:47:14.310 --> 01:47:14.320 align:start position:0%
roads yes
 
01:47:15.350 --> 01:47:15.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:47:17.990 --> 01:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
for the questions
 
01:47:19.669 --> 01:47:19.679 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
01:47:19.679 --> 01:47:21.270 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
you

01:47:21.270 --> 01:47:21.280 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:47:23.109 --> 01:47:23.119 align:start position:0%
uh chair recognizes bill lambert from
 
01:47:23.990 --> 01:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire department of
 
01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.310 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire department of
transportation

01:47:26.310 --> 01:47:26.320 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
01:47:34.470 --> 01:47:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:36.070 --> 01:47:36.080 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chairman and members of
 
01:47:37.910 --> 01:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
the committee it's good to be back this
 
01:47:39.189 --> 01:47:39.199 align:start position:0%
is a little bit different i haven't seen
 
01:47:40.390 --> 01:47:40.400 align:start position:0%
this before
 
01:47:43.350 --> 01:47:43.360 align:start position:0%
um i marked on the card posted the bill
 
01:47:44.550 --> 01:47:44.560 align:start position:0%
recognizing that i hadn't heard
 
01:47:46.629 --> 01:47:46.639 align:start position:0%
testimony so i wasn't sure exactly what
 
01:47:48.070 --> 01:47:48.080 align:start position:0%
the background was
 
01:47:50.149 --> 01:47:50.159 align:start position:0%
um essentially the the reason i oppose
 
01:47:52.149 --> 01:47:52.159 align:start position:0%
the bill is because um
 
01:47:54.870 --> 01:47:54.880 align:start position:0%
rsa 265 63 is specific to town
 
01:47:56.550 --> 01:47:56.560 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction town and city jurisdiction
 
01:47:57.830 --> 01:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
roads it's not
 
01:48:00.950 --> 01:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
265 62 which is the state jurisdiction
 
01:48:02.310 --> 01:48:02.320 align:start position:0%
and then the parent
 
01:48:04.870 --> 01:48:04.880 align:start position:0%
basic law for speed limits is 265 60
 
01:48:07.510 --> 01:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
which sets those statutory speed limits
 
01:48:10.229 --> 01:48:10.239 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't necessarily affect state
 
01:48:12.870 --> 01:48:12.880 align:start position:0%
speed zones uh however there's a number
 
01:48:12.880 --> 01:48:13.830 align:start position:0%
speed zones uh however there's a number
of

01:48:13.830 --> 01:48:13.840 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:48:15.189 --> 01:48:15.199 align:start position:0%
state highways that are either
 
01:48:16.790 --> 01:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
unnumbered routes or go through a
 
01:48:19.030 --> 01:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
business district in a town that public
 
01:48:20.790 --> 01:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
may not understand the difference so
 
01:48:22.550 --> 01:48:22.560 align:start position:0%
that there is some parallel so i do have
 
01:48:23.910 --> 01:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
some concerns
 
01:48:25.510 --> 01:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
for the record bill lambert new
 
01:48:27.350 --> 01:48:27.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire d.o.t
 
01:48:28.790 --> 01:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
i've been the state traffic engineer for
 
01:48:31.510 --> 01:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
21 years a lot of you folks know me
 
01:48:32.950 --> 01:48:32.960 align:start position:0%
i've been
 
01:48:34.629 --> 01:48:34.639 align:start position:0%
had the commissioner of transportation's
 
01:48:36.149 --> 01:48:36.159 align:start position:0%
delegated responsibility for speed
 
01:48:38.310 --> 01:48:38.320 align:start position:0%
limits since 2013 so the last eight
 
01:48:40.870 --> 01:48:40.880 align:start position:0%
years i deal with speed limits a lot
 
01:48:42.790 --> 01:48:42.800 align:start position:0%
i've been invited to speak at ite
 
01:48:45.109 --> 01:48:45.119 align:start position:0%
national meetings on panel discussions
 
01:48:46.629 --> 01:48:46.639 align:start position:0%
i've been participating in publications
 
01:48:48.790 --> 01:48:48.800 align:start position:0%
on speed limits i'm currently working
 
01:48:50.310 --> 01:48:50.320 align:start position:0%
with the new hampshire association
 
01:48:51.669 --> 01:48:51.679 align:start position:0%
chiefs of police and i'll be meeting
 
01:48:53.590 --> 01:48:53.600 align:start position:0%
with them next month at the meeting to
 
01:48:55.669 --> 01:48:55.679 align:start position:0%
talk about how we set speed limits and
 
01:48:57.830 --> 01:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
how we address the speed issue speed is
 
01:48:59.109 --> 01:48:59.119 align:start position:0%
an issue
 
01:49:00.390 --> 01:49:00.400 align:start position:0%
but but usually when people are
 
01:49:01.669 --> 01:49:01.679 align:start position:0%
complaining about speed and they want
 
01:49:03.430 --> 01:49:03.440 align:start position:0%
the speed limit load they're complaining
 
01:49:04.950 --> 01:49:04.960 align:start position:0%
about people that are already 10 or 15
 
01:49:06.390 --> 01:49:06.400 align:start position:0%
miles an hour over the posted speed
 
01:49:08.550 --> 01:49:08.560 align:start position:0%
limit um so changing the number down is
 
01:49:10.790 --> 01:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
not necessarily going to affect that
 
01:49:12.550 --> 01:49:12.560 align:start position:0%
so some of the concerns i have with the
 
01:49:12.560 --> 01:49:13.430 align:start position:0%
so some of the concerns i have with the
bill

01:49:13.430 --> 01:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:49:16.229 --> 01:49:16.239 align:start position:0%
is the one of its existing enforcement
 
01:49:18.390 --> 01:49:18.400 align:start position:0%
and conviction issue i hear from police
 
01:49:21.030 --> 01:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
all the time that if they go to a a
 
01:49:23.189 --> 01:49:23.199 align:start position:0%
court with something less than 10 or 15
 
01:49:25.510 --> 01:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
miles an hour
 
01:49:27.189 --> 01:49:27.199 align:start position:0%
over the posted speed limit it'll get
 
01:49:29.589 --> 01:49:29.599 align:start position:0%
tossed out that judges are unwilling to
 
01:49:31.270 --> 01:49:31.280 align:start position:0%
even consider things that are five to
 
01:49:33.350 --> 01:49:33.360 align:start position:0%
ten miles an hour over
 
01:49:35.030 --> 01:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
and every time we arbitrarily lower
 
01:49:36.790 --> 01:49:36.800 align:start position:0%
speed limits that are not credible for
 
01:49:39.589 --> 01:49:39.599 align:start position:0%
the conditions that we change we we kind
 
01:49:41.510 --> 01:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
of keep on that perception that the
 
01:49:42.790 --> 01:49:42.800 align:start position:0%
speed limit is
 
01:49:44.790 --> 01:49:44.800 align:start position:0%
10 or 50 miles an hour lower lower than
 
01:49:45.990 --> 01:49:46.000 align:start position:0%
what's safe
 
01:49:48.470 --> 01:49:48.480 align:start position:0%
10 miles an hour as stated earlier is
 
01:49:50.310 --> 01:49:50.320 align:start position:0%
i'd say painfully slow if you've ever
 
01:49:52.390 --> 01:49:52.400 align:start position:0%
tried to do 10 miles an hour it's not
 
01:49:52.400 --> 01:49:54.390 align:start position:0%
tried to do 10 miles an hour it's not
possible

01:49:54.390 --> 01:49:54.400 align:start position:0%
possible
 
01:49:56.550 --> 01:49:56.560 align:start position:0%
i talked about the overlap between the
 
01:49:58.390 --> 01:49:58.400 align:start position:0%
local jurisdiction class five roads and
 
01:50:00.390 --> 01:50:00.400 align:start position:0%
the state jurisdiction class two roads a
 
01:50:02.950 --> 01:50:02.960 align:start position:0%
lot of which may not uh the public may
 
01:50:04.950 --> 01:50:04.960 align:start position:0%
not know the difference so while this
 
01:50:07.350 --> 01:50:07.360 align:start position:0%
applies to town jurisdiction roads uh i
 
01:50:08.950 --> 01:50:08.960 align:start position:0%
could see people wanting to apply it to
 
01:50:08.960 --> 01:50:12.070 align:start position:0%
could see people wanting to apply it to
both

01:50:12.070 --> 01:50:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:13.510 --> 01:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
and then speed limits should be
 
01:50:13.520 --> 01:50:15.270 align:start position:0%
and then speed limits should be
self-enforcing

01:50:15.270 --> 01:50:15.280 align:start position:0%
self-enforcing
 
01:50:16.790 --> 01:50:16.800 align:start position:0%
the conditions of the road and the
 
01:50:18.950 --> 01:50:18.960 align:start position:0%
character of the road and the
 
01:50:20.390 --> 01:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
budding property development and
 
01:50:22.709 --> 01:50:22.719 align:start position:0%
activity should be what drives us the
 
01:50:24.629 --> 01:50:24.639 align:start position:0%
speed ideally the speed limit is based
 
01:50:25.910 --> 01:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
on an engineering and traffic
 
01:50:28.709 --> 01:50:28.719 align:start position:0%
investigation and it's set on a value
 
01:50:30.390 --> 01:50:30.400 align:start position:0%
that most people will
 
01:50:31.990 --> 01:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
will do because of the character of the
 
01:50:34.709 --> 01:50:34.719 align:start position:0%
road not because of the sign
 
01:50:36.310 --> 01:50:36.320 align:start position:0%
we tend to think especially in work
 
01:50:38.149 --> 01:50:38.159 align:start position:0%
zones when we're continually pressed by
 
01:50:39.750 --> 01:50:39.760 align:start position:0%
contractors and others the lower speed
 
01:50:41.350 --> 01:50:41.360 align:start position:0%
limits we've been getting away from that
 
01:50:43.430 --> 01:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
practice because we find changing the
 
01:50:45.350 --> 01:50:45.360 align:start position:0%
value in the black and white sign
 
01:50:47.669 --> 01:50:47.679 align:start position:0%
doesn't do a lot of good but if we put
 
01:50:49.270 --> 01:50:49.280 align:start position:0%
up orange signs that tell people why
 
01:50:50.709 --> 01:50:50.719 align:start position:0%
they should slow down and then put an
 
01:50:53.589 --> 01:50:53.599 align:start position:0%
advisory speed panel for that value we
 
01:50:54.790 --> 01:50:54.800 align:start position:0%
find that it's more effective because
 
01:50:56.149 --> 01:50:56.159 align:start position:0%
you're telling people why they should
 
01:50:58.229 --> 01:50:58.239 align:start position:0%
slow down so for conditions that were
 
01:51:00.950 --> 01:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
described earlier our practice would be
 
01:51:03.030 --> 01:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
to put up signs for either children
 
01:51:05.270 --> 01:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
playing or whatever the condition is
 
01:51:07.830 --> 01:51:07.840 align:start position:0%
winding road and then put an advisory
 
01:51:10.149 --> 01:51:10.159 align:start position:0%
speed panel underneath that
 
01:51:11.669 --> 01:51:11.679 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of discussion nationally
 
01:51:13.189 --> 01:51:13.199 align:start position:0%
about changing the way we approach speed
 
01:51:15.030 --> 01:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
limits and it's a lot of it's using
 
01:51:17.109 --> 01:51:17.119 align:start position:0%
terms like safe systems approach and
 
01:51:18.629 --> 01:51:18.639 align:start position:0%
they're talking about
 
01:51:20.390 --> 01:51:20.400 align:start position:0%
looking at changing speed limits in
 
01:51:21.910 --> 01:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
urban conditions so
 
01:51:23.589 --> 01:51:23.599 align:start position:0%
i'm aware of that i'm participating a
 
01:51:26.310 --> 01:51:26.320 align:start position:0%
lot of panel discussions about that and
 
01:51:27.830 --> 01:51:27.840 align:start position:0%
been a lot involved with regional and
 
01:51:30.310 --> 01:51:30.320 align:start position:0%
national discussions on on how that
 
01:51:32.790 --> 01:51:32.800 align:start position:0%
changes the problem that i have is that
 
01:51:34.310 --> 01:51:34.320 align:start position:0%
changing the number on the sign without
 
01:51:35.750 --> 01:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
changing the character of the road is
 
01:51:37.589 --> 01:51:37.599 align:start position:0%
not changing the speed of traffic one of
 
01:51:39.510 --> 01:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
the things i deal with a lot
 
01:51:41.830 --> 01:51:41.840 align:start position:0%
is trying to get people to understand
 
01:51:41.840 --> 01:51:42.950 align:start position:0%
is trying to get people to understand
that

01:51:42.950 --> 01:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:51:44.950 --> 01:51:44.960 align:start position:0%
the speed limit is a maximum value and
 
01:51:47.030 --> 01:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
we keep trying to drop these speed
 
01:51:48.950 --> 01:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
limits down so it's perceived as a
 
01:51:51.109 --> 01:51:51.119 align:start position:0%
minimum value that people are going at
 
01:51:53.189 --> 01:51:53.199 align:start position:0%
least the speed limit this morning on my
 
01:51:54.790 --> 01:51:54.800 align:start position:0%
way to work on manchester street for
 
01:51:57.030 --> 01:51:57.040 align:start position:0%
those that might not know on manchester
 
01:51:59.510 --> 01:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
street route 3 going towards pembroke
 
01:52:01.750 --> 01:52:01.760 align:start position:0%
from concord two lanes that then go
 
01:52:03.830 --> 01:52:03.840 align:start position:0%
through the signals into pembroke i'm in
 
01:52:05.030 --> 01:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
the left lane because i'm gonna make a
 
01:52:07.510 --> 01:52:07.520 align:start position:0%
left to get to my office doing 45 and i
 
01:52:09.510 --> 01:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
think it's posted 50 but i'm climbing
 
01:52:11.430 --> 01:52:11.440 align:start position:0%
the hill at a steady rate and with snow
 
01:52:13.350 --> 01:52:13.360 align:start position:0%
on the ground and the person that passed
 
01:52:15.109 --> 01:52:15.119 align:start position:0%
me on the right stuck his hand out the
 
01:52:17.109 --> 01:52:17.119 align:start position:0%
window with a one finger salute
 
01:52:18.709 --> 01:52:18.719 align:start position:0%
we've got this perception that people
 
01:52:20.390 --> 01:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
think if you're driving responsibly that
 
01:52:22.790 --> 01:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
people think you're going too slow and
 
01:52:24.149 --> 01:52:24.159 align:start position:0%
changing the number and the signs not
 
01:52:25.830 --> 01:52:25.840 align:start position:0%
changing that perception we need to do a
 
01:52:27.669 --> 01:52:27.679 align:start position:0%
lot more
 
01:52:29.510 --> 01:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
outreach to get people to change their
 
01:52:31.189 --> 01:52:31.199 align:start position:0%
behavior and with that i'd be happy to
 
01:52:32.870 --> 01:52:32.880 align:start position:0%
take any questions all right thank you
 
01:52:34.629 --> 01:52:34.639 align:start position:0%
sir i i do have one before i open up to
 
01:52:36.149 --> 01:52:36.159 align:start position:0%
the committee is there anything in
 
01:52:37.270 --> 01:52:37.280 align:start position:0%
statute that would prevent
 
01:52:39.270 --> 01:52:39.280 align:start position:0%
municipalities in these urban areas or
 
01:52:41.830 --> 01:52:41.840 align:start position:0%
high density areas from doing
 
01:52:43.990 --> 01:52:44.000 align:start position:0%
other things like speed calming measures
 
01:52:46.550 --> 01:52:46.560 align:start position:0%
such as speed bumps
 
01:52:48.550 --> 01:52:48.560 align:start position:0%
no certainly on um
 
01:52:50.790 --> 01:52:50.800 align:start position:0%
on the town jurisdiction roads things
 
01:52:53.030 --> 01:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
like chicanes speed humps
 
01:52:54.950 --> 01:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
narrowing roads on street traffic all of
 
01:52:57.030 --> 01:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
that kind of friction tends to slow
 
01:52:59.270 --> 01:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
traffic down a whole lot better than
 
01:53:01.270 --> 01:53:01.280 align:start position:0%
the value of the number on a black and
 
01:53:03.510 --> 01:53:03.520 align:start position:0%
white sign thank you questions from the
 
01:53:03.520 --> 01:53:05.350 align:start position:0%
white sign thank you questions from the
committee

01:53:05.350 --> 01:53:05.360 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:53:07.189 --> 01:53:07.199 align:start position:0%
representative tallerski thank you thank
 
01:53:08.790 --> 01:53:08.800 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question i just wanted
 
01:53:11.189 --> 01:53:11.199 align:start position:0%
to clarify when you talk about
 
01:53:13.109 --> 01:53:13.119 align:start position:0%
the overlay of state roads and town
 
01:53:14.870 --> 01:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
roads so your implication
 
01:53:17.030 --> 01:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
is that there are some state roads that
 
01:53:18.790 --> 01:53:18.800 align:start position:0%
go through these towns
 
01:53:20.870 --> 01:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
that maybe the speed limit does drop but
 
01:53:22.550 --> 01:53:22.560 align:start position:0%
because it's a state road the town does
 
01:53:24.149 --> 01:53:24.159 align:start position:0%
not have any control
 
01:53:26.149 --> 01:53:26.159 align:start position:0%
to lower the speed limit on that section
 
01:53:28.070 --> 01:53:28.080 align:start position:0%
of road is that correct yeah i mean the
 
01:53:30.070 --> 01:53:30.080 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of transportation has
 
01:53:31.750 --> 01:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
authority on all the state roads so all
 
01:53:34.229 --> 01:53:34.239 align:start position:0%
the numbered routes theoretically uh
 
01:53:36.149 --> 01:53:36.159 align:start position:0%
except for the urban compacts and but
 
01:53:37.750 --> 01:53:37.760 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of
 
01:53:39.589 --> 01:53:39.599 align:start position:0%
what we call tier five roads the
 
01:53:42.070 --> 01:53:42.080 align:start position:0%
unnumbered state routes that uh that are
 
01:53:43.510 --> 01:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
state maintained and the commissioner of
 
01:53:45.830 --> 01:53:45.840 align:start position:0%
transportation has jurisdiction for and
 
01:53:47.510 --> 01:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
unless you're familiar with the process
 
01:53:49.350 --> 01:53:49.360 align:start position:0%
and know which one is a state versus
 
01:53:49.360 --> 01:53:50.229 align:start position:0%
and know which one is a state versus
town

01:53:50.229 --> 01:53:50.239 align:start position:0%
town
 
01:53:51.990 --> 01:53:52.000 align:start position:0%
the public's not going to know that and
 
01:53:54.229 --> 01:53:54.239 align:start position:0%
somebody mentioned belmont earlier so
 
01:53:55.990 --> 01:53:56.000 align:start position:0%
140 in belmont
 
01:53:57.990 --> 01:53:58.000 align:start position:0%
takes a hard left at main street if
 
01:53:59.750 --> 01:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
you're on 140 that's a state route but
 
01:54:01.109 --> 01:54:01.119 align:start position:0%
if you take the right on the main street
 
01:54:03.030 --> 01:54:03.040 align:start position:0%
which looks like the main route that's a
 
01:54:04.470 --> 01:54:04.480 align:start position:0%
town road
 
01:54:05.830 --> 01:54:05.840 align:start position:0%
and that goes more or less through the
 
01:54:08.470 --> 01:54:08.480 align:start position:0%
business district of belmont most of the
 
01:54:09.669 --> 01:54:09.679 align:start position:0%
public's not going to be aware of that
 
01:54:11.430 --> 01:54:11.440 align:start position:0%
they don't necessarily just see the
 
01:54:11.440 --> 01:54:12.709 align:start position:0%
they don't necessarily just see the
difference

01:54:12.709 --> 01:54:12.719 align:start position:0%
difference
 
01:54:14.070 --> 01:54:14.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for the questions
 
01:54:14.080 --> 01:54:15.750 align:start position:0%
thank you for the questions
representative

01:54:15.750 --> 01:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:54:16.950 --> 01:54:16.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question you
 
01:54:18.390 --> 01:54:18.400 align:start position:0%
might have answered this is there a 10
 
01:54:20.830 --> 01:54:20.840 align:start position:0%
mile an hour speed limit anywhere in new
 
01:54:22.790 --> 01:54:22.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire uh thank you for the question
 
01:54:24.790 --> 01:54:24.800 align:start position:0%
i believe the only place in statute that
 
01:54:26.870 --> 01:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
allows a 10 mile an hour speed limit is
 
01:54:28.550 --> 01:54:28.560 align:start position:0%
in alleys
 
01:54:31.510 --> 01:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
and i want to say 20 something years ago
 
01:54:34.149 --> 01:54:34.159 align:start position:0%
manchester um changed the speed limit or
 
01:54:36.070 --> 01:54:36.080 align:start position:0%
introduced that value because there's
 
01:54:38.310 --> 01:54:38.320 align:start position:0%
places between buildings where cars are
 
01:54:39.750 --> 01:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
allowed to travel
 
01:54:41.910 --> 01:54:41.920 align:start position:0%
at 10 miles an hour but other that than
 
01:54:45.030 --> 01:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
that on a public road class 5
 
01:54:46.550 --> 01:54:46.560 align:start position:0%
there's probably places that are
 
01:54:49.030 --> 01:54:49.040 align:start position:0%
advisory speeds of 15 miles an hour and
 
01:54:52.790 --> 01:54:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:54.870 --> 01:54:54.880 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
01:54:57.109 --> 01:54:57.119 align:start position:0%
i have one more just out of curiosity
 
01:54:58.790 --> 01:54:58.800 align:start position:0%
how many requests
 
01:55:01.430 --> 01:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
a year does the department get
 
01:55:05.109 --> 01:55:05.119 align:start position:0%
to drop below the 25 below 25. thank you
 
01:55:08.070 --> 01:55:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:09.510 --> 01:55:09.520 align:start position:0%
the only one that i can think of and it
 
01:55:12.149 --> 01:55:12.159 align:start position:0%
wasn't on a state jurisdiction road
 
01:55:13.990 --> 01:55:14.000 align:start position:0%
was when portsmouth has
 
01:55:15.830 --> 01:55:15.840 align:start position:0%
locations that are in market square that
 
01:55:17.910 --> 01:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
are 20 i think those are not compliant
 
01:55:19.350 --> 01:55:19.360 align:start position:0%
with the current statute and i think
 
01:55:20.870 --> 01:55:20.880 align:start position:0%
they tried to change this bill a couple
 
01:55:22.310 --> 01:55:22.320 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
01:55:23.910 --> 01:55:23.920 align:start position:0%
so i don't get a lot of requests for
 
01:55:25.910 --> 01:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
going below 20.
 
01:55:29.270 --> 01:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
we get the occasional to go to 25.
 
01:55:33.109 --> 01:55:33.119 align:start position:0%
we changed the interpretation of rsa 265
 
01:55:35.030 --> 01:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
62 a few years ago
 
01:55:38.149 --> 01:55:38.159 align:start position:0%
it used to say or it does stay that the
 
01:55:39.750 --> 01:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner can consider
 
01:55:42.149 --> 01:55:42.159 align:start position:0%
as low as 25 in compact parts of cities
 
01:55:44.470 --> 01:55:44.480 align:start position:0%
and towns the d.o.t had always
 
01:55:46.070 --> 01:55:46.080 align:start position:0%
interpreted that to mean that formal
 
01:55:47.589 --> 01:55:47.599 align:start position:0%
urban compact so like the city of
 
01:55:47.599 --> 01:55:48.790 align:start position:0%
urban compact so like the city of
concord

01:55:48.790 --> 01:55:48.800 align:start position:0%
concord
 
01:55:50.629 --> 01:55:50.639 align:start position:0%
downtown franklin places like that that
 
01:55:53.750 --> 01:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
have formal urban compacts
 
01:55:55.510 --> 01:55:55.520 align:start position:0%
when we several years ago the town of
 
01:55:56.950 --> 01:55:56.960 align:start position:0%
tilton wanted to lower the speed limit
 
01:55:59.109 --> 01:55:59.119 align:start position:0%
in downtown tilton which is not an urban
 
01:56:01.350 --> 01:56:01.360 align:start position:0%
compact and we took a look at the
 
01:56:03.589 --> 01:56:03.599 align:start position:0%
statute and we reinterpreted compact
 
01:56:05.350 --> 01:56:05.360 align:start position:0%
parts of cities and towns to be a
 
01:56:07.589 --> 01:56:07.599 align:start position:0%
density definition and not an urban
 
01:56:11.270 --> 01:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:11.280 --> 01:56:12.229 align:start position:0%
 
tilton

01:56:12.229 --> 01:56:12.239 align:start position:0%
tilton
 
01:56:16.390 --> 01:56:16.400 align:start position:0%
new market um
 
01:56:17.990 --> 01:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
there's one other town that escapes me
 
01:56:20.790 --> 01:56:20.800 align:start position:0%
to go to 25 miles an hour all right
 
01:56:21.910 --> 01:56:21.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:56:25.350 --> 01:56:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:27.189 --> 01:56:27.199 align:start position:0%
representative telersky thank you very
 
01:56:29.109 --> 01:56:29.119 align:start position:0%
quickly thank you for taking my question
 
01:56:32.470 --> 01:56:32.480 align:start position:0%
um we discussed briefly the process of a
 
01:56:33.830 --> 01:56:33.840 align:start position:0%

applying
 
01:56:37.270 --> 01:56:37.280 align:start position:0%
for a waiver on this can you just tell
 
01:56:38.790 --> 01:56:38.800 align:start position:0%
us quickly what that would entail and
 
01:56:40.310 --> 01:56:40.320 align:start position:0%
what the time frame
 
01:56:44.470 --> 01:56:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:46.229 --> 01:56:46.239 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um i heard
 
01:56:48.070 --> 01:56:48.080 align:start position:0%
the question and the discussion about a
 
01:56:50.790 --> 01:56:50.800 align:start position:0%
waiver process
 
01:56:52.229 --> 01:56:52.239 align:start position:0%
i'm not aware of that that might be
 
01:56:53.750 --> 01:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
something i'd have to review with the
 
01:56:55.189 --> 01:56:55.199 align:start position:0%
ag's office
 
01:56:59.990 --> 01:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
i know that rsa 265 63
 
01:57:03.189 --> 01:57:03.199 align:start position:0%
allows the taos the towns to
 
01:57:04.310 --> 01:57:04.320 align:start position:0%
change speed limits within their
 
01:57:06.629 --> 01:57:06.639 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction but it it's also subject to
 
01:57:09.189 --> 01:57:09.199 align:start position:0%
an engineering and traffic
 
01:57:09.199 --> 01:57:09.750 align:start position:0%
an engineering and traffic
engineering investigation

01:57:09.750 --> 01:57:09.760 align:start position:0%
engineering investigation
 
01:57:11.669 --> 01:57:11.679 align:start position:0%
traffic investigation is not defined in
 
01:57:14.149 --> 01:57:14.159 align:start position:0%
statute but in practice and in
 
01:57:17.350 --> 01:57:17.360 align:start position:0%
the dot practice it involves a fairly
 
01:57:17.360 --> 01:57:19.350 align:start position:0%
the dot practice it involves a fairly
comprehensive

01:57:19.350 --> 01:57:19.360 align:start position:0%
comprehensive
 
01:57:20.950 --> 01:57:20.960 align:start position:0%
includes a speed study evaluation of
 
01:57:20.960 --> 01:57:22.229 align:start position:0%
includes a speed study evaluation of
geometry

01:57:22.229 --> 01:57:22.239 align:start position:0%
geometry
 
01:57:24.709 --> 01:57:24.719 align:start position:0%
uh crash history and um
 
01:57:27.189 --> 01:57:27.199 align:start position:0%
things like that and typically per the
 
01:57:28.870 --> 01:57:28.880 align:start position:0%
federal manual on uniform traffic
 
01:57:31.270 --> 01:57:31.280 align:start position:0%
control devices the speed limit should
 
01:57:33.350 --> 01:57:33.360 align:start position:0%
be set within five mil five miles an
 
01:57:36.229 --> 01:57:36.239 align:start position:0%
hour of a measured 85th percentile speed
 
01:57:37.830 --> 01:57:37.840 align:start position:0%
so a lot of people have asked me in the
 
01:57:40.149 --> 01:57:40.159 align:start position:0%
past to drop the speed limit so they can
 
01:57:41.510 --> 01:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
drop the speed
 
01:57:43.109 --> 01:57:43.119 align:start position:0%
don't understand that the
 
01:57:43.119 --> 01:57:44.470 align:start position:0%
don't understand that the
concept

01:57:44.470 --> 01:57:44.480 align:start position:0%
concept
 
01:57:46.070 --> 01:57:46.080 align:start position:0%
in practice is to
 
01:57:47.669 --> 01:57:47.679 align:start position:0%
determine what people are naturally
 
01:57:49.109 --> 01:57:49.119 align:start position:0%
doing because of the character of the
 
01:57:50.709 --> 01:57:50.719 align:start position:0%
road and setting the speed limit based
 
01:57:52.390 --> 01:57:52.400 align:start position:0%
on what most people feel is reasonable
 
01:57:54.709 --> 01:57:54.719 align:start position:0%
and prudent for conditions
 
01:57:56.550 --> 01:57:56.560 align:start position:0%
so i think the answer to your question
 
01:57:57.910 --> 01:57:57.920 align:start position:0%
is that towns and cities would have to
 
01:57:59.510 --> 01:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
follow that same process of doing an
 
01:58:02.550 --> 01:58:02.560 align:start position:0%
engineering and traffic investigation
 
01:58:04.950 --> 01:58:04.960 align:start position:0%
if it is a
 
01:58:07.030 --> 01:58:07.040 align:start position:0%
within an urban area that's a state
 
01:58:08.629 --> 01:58:08.639 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction road
 
01:58:10.550 --> 01:58:10.560 align:start position:0%
they have the ability to petition the
 
01:58:13.350 --> 01:58:13.360 align:start position:0%
the commission of transportation
 
01:58:15.589 --> 01:58:15.599 align:start position:0%
to consider going as low as 25 and we've
 
01:58:18.310 --> 01:58:18.320 align:start position:0%
done that like i said in new market in
 
01:58:19.669 --> 01:58:19.679 align:start position:0%
tilton and
 
01:58:21.189 --> 01:58:21.199 align:start position:0%
one out of the town at least that that
 
01:58:23.109 --> 01:58:23.119 align:start position:0%
escapes me at this time
 
01:58:24.390 --> 01:58:24.400 align:start position:0%
we've also in
 
01:58:26.070 --> 01:58:26.080 align:start position:0%
something else that you may be aware of
 
01:58:27.589 --> 01:58:27.599 align:start position:0%
in this group some of you may be aware
 
01:58:30.149 --> 01:58:30.159 align:start position:0%
of that senator stiles filed a bill
 
01:58:32.550 --> 01:58:32.560 align:start position:0%
several years not that many years ago to
 
01:58:34.629 --> 01:58:34.639 align:start position:0%
allow towns and cities even on state
 
01:58:37.589 --> 01:58:37.599 align:start position:0%
roads to to adopt a seasonal speed limit
 
01:58:39.109 --> 01:58:39.119 align:start position:0%
so they can go as low as i think 10
 
01:58:40.709 --> 01:58:40.719 align:start position:0%
miles an hour less than the normal speed
 
01:58:40.719 --> 01:58:41.589 align:start position:0%
miles an hour less than the normal speed
limit

01:58:41.589 --> 01:58:41.599 align:start position:0%
limit
 
01:58:43.669 --> 01:58:43.679 align:start position:0%
in uh for up to four months a year in
 
01:58:46.070 --> 01:58:46.080 align:start position:0%
places that are seasonally congested by
 
01:58:48.310 --> 01:58:48.320 align:start position:0%
bicycles and pedestrians
 
01:58:49.669 --> 01:58:49.679 align:start position:0%
and the process for that is if they
 
01:58:51.990 --> 01:58:52.000 align:start position:0%
petition the department we have
 
01:58:54.390 --> 01:58:54.400 align:start position:0%
somewhat a of a review to make sure that
 
01:58:56.870 --> 01:58:56.880 align:start position:0%
we can confirm that um that the place is
 
01:58:58.310 --> 01:58:58.320 align:start position:0%
likely to be congested with bikes and
 
01:59:00.629 --> 01:59:00.639 align:start position:0%
peds during that time frame
 
01:59:02.629 --> 01:59:02.639 align:start position:0%
but it's essentially it's a rubber stamp
 
01:59:04.390 --> 01:59:04.400 align:start position:0%
if the town is interested in doing the
 
01:59:06.470 --> 01:59:06.480 align:start position:0%
sign work um
 
01:59:08.550 --> 01:59:08.560 align:start position:0%
for our approval then they can lower the
 
01:59:10.470 --> 01:59:10.480 align:start position:0%
speed limit up to 10 miles an hour on
 
01:59:10.480 --> 01:59:11.910 align:start position:0%
speed limit up to 10 miles an hour on
during

01:59:11.910 --> 01:59:11.920 align:start position:0%
during
 
01:59:16.149 --> 01:59:16.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:18.149 --> 01:59:18.159 align:start position:0%
questions and actually just jog my
 
01:59:19.990 --> 01:59:20.000 align:start position:0%
memory too and now i remember this the
 
01:59:21.830 --> 01:59:21.840 align:start position:0%
seasonal further questions from the
 
01:59:21.840 --> 01:59:23.669 align:start position:0%

upon presentation of evidence that it

that there is already um exemption for
 
02:05:36.069 --> 02:05:36.079 align:start position:0%
custom vehicles in certain circumstances
 
02:05:37.669 --> 02:05:37.679 align:start position:0%
and i apologize the committee if i need
 
02:05:39.990 --> 02:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
to be educated on this
 
02:05:41.189 --> 02:05:41.199 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question on the front
 
02:05:42.790 --> 02:05:42.800 align:start position:0%
plate sorry to be clear yeah thank you
 
02:05:44.390 --> 02:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
for the question the one i mentioned was
 
02:05:46.229 --> 02:05:46.239 align:start position:0%
for custom vehicles but i am also aware
 
02:05:48.870 --> 02:05:48.880 align:start position:0%
there's also an exemption for hot uh
 
02:05:50.629 --> 02:05:50.639 align:start position:0%
registered i think it's either hot rods
 
02:05:51.990 --> 02:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
or street rods i don't know the exact
 
02:05:54.550 --> 02:05:54.560 align:start position:0%
term but those two vehicle categories
 
02:05:57.669 --> 02:05:57.679 align:start position:0%
both have explicit uh exemptions in the
 
02:05:59.669 --> 02:05:59.679 align:start position:0%
rsas to not have to display a front
 
02:06:00.830 --> 02:06:00.840 align:start position:0%
light number
 
02:06:00.840 --> 02:06:02.470 align:start position:0%
light number
plate

02:06:02.470 --> 02:06:02.480 align:start position:0%
plate
 
02:06:04.149 --> 02:06:04.159 align:start position:0%
representative gorski
 
02:06:05.350 --> 02:06:05.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
02:06:07.189 --> 02:06:07.199 align:start position:0%
representative take my question
 
02:06:09.750 --> 02:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
is this sticker like something that's
 
02:06:11.750 --> 02:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
renewable each year or is it like a
 
02:06:13.990 --> 02:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
one-time kind of thing
 
02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:15.109 align:start position:0%
one-time kind of thing
uh

02:06:15.109 --> 02:06:15.119 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:06:16.470 --> 02:06:16.480 align:start position:0%
at least as written in the bill it would
 
02:06:18.629 --> 02:06:18.639 align:start position:0%
be a one-time thing although i believe
 
02:06:20.629 --> 02:06:20.639 align:start position:0%
there was i added a provision that if
 
02:06:21.830 --> 02:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
you've got a windshield replacement you
 
02:06:24.310 --> 02:06:24.320 align:start position:0%
can buy a new one okay thank you
 
02:06:27.030 --> 02:06:27.040 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
02:06:28.870 --> 02:06:28.880 align:start position:0%
representative fenton
 
02:06:29.990 --> 02:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question and thank
 
02:06:31.430 --> 02:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
you for being here today
 
02:06:33.589 --> 02:06:33.599 align:start position:0%
um i don't see anything about
 
02:06:33.599 --> 02:06:35.109 align:start position:0%
um i don't see anything about
uh

02:06:35.109 --> 02:06:35.119 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:06:37.350 --> 02:06:37.360 align:start position:0%
if i don't have the sticker
 
02:06:42.470 --> 02:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:44.870 --> 02:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question uh
 
02:06:46.709 --> 02:06:46.719 align:start position:0%
you're right i would there's nothing
 
02:06:47.750 --> 02:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
explicitly stating what the
 
02:06:49.990 --> 02:06:50.000 align:start position:0%
repercussions are but i would
 
02:06:51.669 --> 02:06:51.679 align:start position:0%
at least with the way it's worded you
 
02:06:53.030 --> 02:06:53.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be meeting the terms of your
 
02:06:54.790 --> 02:06:54.800 align:start position:0%
exemption because it says that you shall
 
02:06:56.629 --> 02:06:56.639 align:start position:0%
display it as part of the exemption and
 
02:06:58.870 --> 02:06:58.880 align:start position:0%
waiver process so that point i would
 
02:07:00.069 --> 02:07:00.079 align:start position:0%
think that you would not be meaning the
 
02:07:01.430 --> 02:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
terms of the exemption and you could
 
02:07:03.189 --> 02:07:03.199 align:start position:0%
still be cited for not properly
 
02:07:05.750 --> 02:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
displaying a front plate
 
02:07:07.830 --> 02:07:07.840 align:start position:0%
follow-up so
 
02:07:09.170 --> 02:07:09.180 align:start position:0%
wouldn't we need a new
 
02:07:09.180 --> 02:07:10.790 align:start position:0%
wouldn't we need a new
[Music]

02:07:10.790 --> 02:07:10.800 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:07:13.669 --> 02:07:13.679 align:start position:0%
uh penalty for this so i apply for this
 
02:07:14.790 --> 02:07:14.800 align:start position:0%
i don't have the front plate i don't
 
02:07:16.390 --> 02:07:16.400 align:start position:0%
have the sticker on what am i being
 
02:07:18.390 --> 02:07:18.400 align:start position:0%
excited for and what's the
 
02:07:20.069 --> 02:07:20.079 align:start position:0%
penalty for that
 
02:07:22.069 --> 02:07:22.079 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i
 
02:07:23.750 --> 02:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
would think that we wouldn't need a new
 
02:07:25.430 --> 02:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
penalty you just apply the existing
 
02:07:27.350 --> 02:07:27.360 align:start position:0%
penalty for not displaying a new front
 
02:07:28.629 --> 02:07:28.639 align:start position:0%
plate because
 
02:07:30.790 --> 02:07:30.800 align:start position:0%
if you haven't met the terms of your
 
02:07:33.750 --> 02:07:33.760 align:start position:0%
exemption and the exemption then
 
02:07:36.790 --> 02:07:36.800 align:start position:0%
you aren't exempt from the existing fine
 
02:07:38.310 --> 02:07:38.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:07:40.390 --> 02:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
for the questions representative run
 
02:07:42.149 --> 02:07:42.159 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
02:07:43.830 --> 02:07:43.840 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
02:07:45.750 --> 02:07:45.760 align:start position:0%
i'm a little bit curious about what
 
02:07:53.109 --> 02:07:53.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:56.790 --> 02:07:56.800 align:start position:0%
on line six where you mentioned that uh
 
02:07:59.510 --> 02:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
the the number plate reduces the
 
02:08:02.550 --> 02:08:02.560 align:start position:0%
historic character its collectibility um
 
02:08:04.550 --> 02:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
and the devaluation or the value of the
 
02:08:04.560 --> 02:08:05.910 align:start position:0%
and the devaluation or the value of the
vehicle

02:08:05.910 --> 02:08:05.920 align:start position:0%
vehicle
 
02:08:05.920 --> 02:08:06.870 align:start position:0%
vehicle
um

02:08:06.870 --> 02:08:06.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:09.109 --> 02:08:09.119 align:start position:0%
i and i've bought a lot of cars over the
 
02:08:12.470 --> 02:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
years and i don't know if the having a
 
02:08:14.870 --> 02:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
front license plates impacted the the
 
02:08:17.030 --> 02:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
market value of that do you know why
 
02:08:19.830 --> 02:08:19.840 align:start position:0%
that's included in the bill
 
02:08:22.629 --> 02:08:22.639 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um
 
02:08:22.639 --> 02:08:23.589 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um
there's

02:08:23.589 --> 02:08:23.599 align:start position:0%
there's
 
02:08:23.599 --> 02:08:24.870 align:start position:0%
there's
certainly

02:08:24.870 --> 02:08:24.880 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
02:08:26.550 --> 02:08:26.560 align:start position:0%
many types of collectible cars
 
02:08:26.560 --> 02:08:28.950 align:start position:0%
many types of collectible cars
especially

02:08:28.950 --> 02:08:28.960 align:start position:0%
especially
 
02:08:31.510 --> 02:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
cars that at least are notable and older
 
02:08:34.950 --> 02:08:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:37.270 --> 02:08:37.280 align:start position:0%
might depend exactly on the age where
 
02:08:39.270 --> 02:08:39.280 align:start position:0%
people take great value
 
02:08:41.750 --> 02:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
having them in their original condition
 
02:08:43.510 --> 02:08:43.520 align:start position:0%
as they were made and often that's
 
02:08:45.830 --> 02:08:45.840 align:start position:0%
without a front plate mounting bracket
 
02:08:47.990 --> 02:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
um i can especially can think of people
 
02:08:49.430 --> 02:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
that like to take cars around to car
 
02:08:49.440 --> 02:08:50.709 align:start position:0%
that like to take cars around to car
shows

02:08:50.709 --> 02:08:50.719 align:start position:0%
shows
 
02:08:52.709 --> 02:08:52.719 align:start position:0%
they don't want to alter the vehicle
 
02:08:54.470 --> 02:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
from its original character to add that
 
02:08:55.990 --> 02:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
and if they did
 
02:08:57.750 --> 02:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
then it would lower its resale value
 
02:08:59.589 --> 02:08:59.599 align:start position:0%
especially in the 20 other states that
 
02:09:04.310 --> 02:09:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:05.910 --> 02:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
02:09:08.550 --> 02:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
representative thompson
 
02:09:10.310 --> 02:09:10.320 align:start position:0%
do you have any idea how many people are
 
02:09:12.390 --> 02:09:12.400 align:start position:0%
going to want to do this
 
02:09:12.400 --> 02:09:14.069 align:start position:0%
going to want to do this
um

02:09:14.069 --> 02:09:14.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:16.310 --> 02:09:16.320 align:start position:0%
is this been a big thing because it
 
02:09:18.390 --> 02:09:18.400 align:start position:0%
seems like state's going to invest a lot
 
02:09:20.790 --> 02:09:20.800 align:start position:0%
of time and energy and money
 
02:09:20.800 --> 02:09:21.990 align:start position:0%
of time and energy and money
into

02:09:21.990 --> 02:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
into
 
02:09:27.030 --> 02:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:29.750 --> 02:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
only only be required by
 
02:09:33.030 --> 02:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
a few hundred people
 
02:09:34.470 --> 02:09:34.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question uh i
 
02:09:36.950 --> 02:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
certainly have not done a um
 
02:09:38.790 --> 02:09:38.800 align:start position:0%
attempted to create a precise count of
 
02:09:41.030 --> 02:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
how many people want this i have had
 
02:09:43.910 --> 02:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
many people contact me um
 
02:09:45.830 --> 02:09:45.840 align:start position:0%
and say they're contacting mbi for
 
02:09:47.270 --> 02:09:47.280 align:start position:0%
organizations that have more members
 
02:09:50.310 --> 02:09:50.320 align:start position:0%
that also are interested um
 
02:09:50.320 --> 02:09:52.229 align:start position:0%
that also are interested um
specifically

02:09:52.229 --> 02:09:52.239 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
02:09:55.750 --> 02:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
the i think it's a porsche motor club
 
02:09:57.510 --> 02:09:57.520 align:start position:0%
that are definitely very interested in
 
02:09:59.189 --> 02:09:59.199 align:start position:0%
applying for this what that will add up
 
02:10:00.870 --> 02:10:00.880 align:start position:0%
to i couldn't tell you at this point
 
02:10:02.550 --> 02:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
yeah it is
 
02:10:04.069 --> 02:10:04.079 align:start position:0%
it is indeterminable according to the
 
02:10:06.709 --> 02:10:06.719 align:start position:0%
fiscal note but i will tell our guests
 
02:10:08.629 --> 02:10:08.639 align:start position:0%
on transportation that
 
02:10:11.430 --> 02:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
exemptions from the front plate um
 
02:10:13.350 --> 02:10:13.360 align:start position:0%
have been heard quite quite often in the
 
02:10:16.149 --> 02:10:16.159 align:start position:0%
past few years in transportation
 
02:10:17.750 --> 02:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
any further questions from the committee
 
02:10:20.790 --> 02:10:20.800 align:start position:0%
representative tallerski
 
02:10:22.149 --> 02:10:22.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
02:10:25.589 --> 02:10:25.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:27.350 --> 02:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
i understand
 
02:10:29.430 --> 02:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
the discussion as we've heard many times
 
02:10:29.440 --> 02:10:30.390 align:start position:0%
the discussion as we've heard many times
about

02:10:30.390 --> 02:10:30.400 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:10:32.629 --> 02:10:32.639 align:start position:0%
collectible cars historic cars that type
 
02:10:34.870 --> 02:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
of thing and the attempt of this
 
02:10:37.109 --> 02:10:37.119 align:start position:0%
committee last year to pass something
 
02:10:39.030 --> 02:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
similar for
 
02:10:41.109 --> 02:10:41.119 align:start position:0%
antiques and hot rods which i believe
 
02:10:43.669 --> 02:10:43.679 align:start position:0%
was killed in the senate transportation
 
02:10:43.679 --> 02:10:45.510 align:start position:0%
was killed in the senate transportation
committee

02:10:45.510 --> 02:10:45.520 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:10:45.520 --> 02:10:46.310 align:start position:0%
committee
but

02:10:46.310 --> 02:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:10:48.629 --> 02:10:48.639 align:start position:0%
the ambiguity of line six representative
 
02:10:53.669 --> 02:10:53.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:53.679 --> 02:10:55.109 align:start position:0%
 
that

02:10:55.109 --> 02:10:55.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:10:56.629 --> 02:10:56.639 align:start position:0%
if you believe it's going to devalue
 
02:10:58.709 --> 02:10:58.719 align:start position:0%
your vehicle well
 
02:11:00.629 --> 02:11:00.639 align:start position:0%
anyone could probably
 
02:11:02.790 --> 02:11:02.800 align:start position:0%
or would you agree with me
 
02:11:04.790 --> 02:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
that the way this is written
 
02:11:06.149 --> 02:11:06.159 align:start position:0%
anyone could say this is going to
 
02:11:07.910 --> 02:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
devalue my vehicle and it could be
 
02:11:10.709 --> 02:11:10.719 align:start position:0%
someone who spends seventy thousand
 
02:11:13.589 --> 02:11:13.599 align:start position:0%
dollars on a porsche or a tesla or even
 
02:11:15.510 --> 02:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
someone who spends a lot of their hard
 
02:11:18.470 --> 02:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
earned money on a brand new honda crv
 
02:11:20.629 --> 02:11:20.639 align:start position:0%
um i guess i'm just
 
02:11:22.310 --> 02:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
trying to understand
 
02:11:25.430 --> 02:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
where this would be limited
 
02:11:27.589 --> 02:11:27.599 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question uh you are
 
02:11:29.270 --> 02:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
correct that i didn't want to get
 
02:11:31.589 --> 02:11:31.599 align:start position:0%
too deep into the specifics in
 
02:11:34.149 --> 02:11:34.159 align:start position:0%
uh line six but that's also a little bit
 
02:11:36.229 --> 02:11:36.239 align:start position:0%
why i have in line seven that they have
 
02:11:38.709 --> 02:11:38.719 align:start position:0%
to include a statement from
 
02:11:40.790 --> 02:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
somebody that knows these things either
 
02:11:43.589 --> 02:11:43.599 align:start position:0%
car dealer appraiser or collector
 
02:11:45.830 --> 02:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
and good information to support the
 
02:11:48.310 --> 02:11:48.320 align:start position:0%
waiver um i wouldn't think that it would
 
02:11:50.229 --> 02:11:50.239 align:start position:0%
be considered very well supported if the
 
02:11:52.709 --> 02:11:52.719 align:start position:0%
estimated devaluation was ten dollars or
 
02:11:53.990 --> 02:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:56.790 align:start position:0%
something like that
um

02:11:56.790 --> 02:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:58.870 --> 02:11:58.880 align:start position:0%
as far as if you wanted if the committee
 
02:12:00.310 --> 02:12:00.320 align:start position:0%
wanted to tighten up that language and
 
02:12:02.709 --> 02:12:02.719 align:start position:0%
try to make more specific about how much
 
02:12:04.870 --> 02:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
devaluation would have to happen to
 
02:12:07.350 --> 02:12:07.360 align:start position:0%
qualify that's certainly not something i
 
02:12:09.750 --> 02:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
would be opposed to but it is i thought
 
02:12:11.189 --> 02:12:11.199 align:start position:0%
a little bit challenging for exactly
 
02:12:14.229 --> 02:12:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:16.629 --> 02:12:16.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:18.629 --> 02:12:18.639 align:start position:0%
it could be subjective any further
 
02:12:20.870 --> 02:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
02:12:22.870 --> 02:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
um i've got representative klein knight
 
02:12:26.069 --> 02:12:26.079 align:start position:0%
i will try to go around again um thank
 
02:12:27.990 --> 02:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
you so much chair and i know you're
 
02:12:29.910 --> 02:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
looking at me and i have like six
 
02:12:32.069 --> 02:12:32.079 align:start position:0%
questions so if the other representative
 
02:12:34.629 --> 02:12:34.639 align:start position:0%
wants to take i i am if if you want me
 
02:12:36.149 --> 02:12:36.159 align:start position:0%
to go last i certainly will well you're
 
02:12:37.350 --> 02:12:37.360 align:start position:0%
assuming i'm going to give you something
 
02:12:41.750 --> 02:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
yeah i hope that i really hope you do
 
02:12:43.189 --> 02:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
but i recognize you first i want you to
 
02:12:44.790 --> 02:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
start with one of them okay
 
02:12:48.870 --> 02:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:50.550 --> 02:12:50.560 align:start position:0%
are you aware that most vehicle
 
02:12:52.629 --> 02:12:52.639 align:start position:0%
manufacturers offer a front license
 
02:12:54.629 --> 02:12:54.639 align:start position:0%
plate mounting bracket designed for your
 
02:12:56.790 --> 02:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
model of vehicle that attaches to the
 
02:12:58.629 --> 02:12:58.639 align:start position:0%
underside of the bumper and might not
 
02:13:00.870 --> 02:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
even require drilling holes and devalue
 
02:13:03.350 --> 02:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
your vehicle at all
 
02:13:05.589 --> 02:13:05.599 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i
 
02:13:07.750 --> 02:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
am aware that most new
 
02:13:10.790 --> 02:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
vehicle manufacturers do that
 
02:13:13.510 --> 02:13:13.520 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't say all necessarily
 
02:13:16.629 --> 02:13:16.639 align:start position:0%
especially in regards to imported cars
 
02:13:18.149 --> 02:13:18.159 align:start position:0%
that might be designed for european
 
02:13:20.229 --> 02:13:20.239 align:start position:0%
style license plates
 
02:13:22.870 --> 02:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:24.550 --> 02:13:24.560 align:start position:0%
of course one of the issues of this
 
02:13:26.870 --> 02:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
build is the older cars that that might
 
02:13:28.470 --> 02:13:28.480 align:start position:0%
not be true for
 
02:13:28.480 --> 02:13:29.669 align:start position:0%
not be true for
um

02:13:29.669 --> 02:13:29.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:13:29.679 --> 02:13:31.109 align:start position:0%
um
follow-up

02:13:31.109 --> 02:13:31.119 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:13:33.270 --> 02:13:33.280 align:start position:0%
for this one particular
 
02:13:35.350 --> 02:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
um could you give us a list of those
 
02:13:38.390 --> 02:13:38.400 align:start position:0%
specific vehicles that um won't be able
 
02:13:38.400 --> 02:13:39.589 align:start position:0%
specific vehicles that um won't be able
to

02:13:39.589 --> 02:13:39.599 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:13:41.510 --> 02:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
adopt a
 
02:13:43.910 --> 02:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
hanging license plate
 
02:13:45.669 --> 02:13:45.679 align:start position:0%
how how many vehicles this would affect
 
02:13:48.069 --> 02:13:48.079 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
02:13:48.079 --> 02:13:48.870 align:start position:0%
in the state
uh

02:13:48.870 --> 02:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:13:51.109 --> 02:13:51.119 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i
 
02:13:53.030 --> 02:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
can't give you a
 
02:13:56.229 --> 02:13:56.239 align:start position:0%
list of models or is or certainly not at
 
02:13:57.750 --> 02:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
this time a count of vehicles in the
 
02:13:57.760 --> 02:13:58.629 align:start position:0%
this time a count of vehicles in the
state

02:13:58.629 --> 02:13:58.639 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:13:58.639 --> 02:14:00.310 align:start position:0%
state
um

02:14:00.310 --> 02:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:00.320 --> 02:14:01.109 align:start position:0%
um
and

02:14:01.109 --> 02:14:01.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:14:02.550 --> 02:14:02.560 align:start position:0%
i think
 
02:14:05.109 --> 02:14:05.119 align:start position:0%
cant is a strong word i think we have
 
02:14:07.189 --> 02:14:07.199 align:start position:0%
seen for vehicles registered in the
 
02:14:08.870 --> 02:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
state that people have gotten even when
 
02:14:10.550 --> 02:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
the manufacturer doesn't provide an
 
02:14:12.229 --> 02:14:12.239 align:start position:0%
option creative and how to make it
 
02:14:12.239 --> 02:14:13.589 align:start position:0%
option creative and how to make it
happen

02:14:13.589 --> 02:14:13.599 align:start position:0%
happen
 
02:14:15.589 --> 02:14:15.599 align:start position:0%
but in many cases
 
02:14:17.910 --> 02:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
either directly or indirectly because
 
02:14:17.920 --> 02:14:18.950 align:start position:0%
either directly or indirectly because
it's

02:14:18.950 --> 02:14:18.960 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:14:20.870 --> 02:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
loose and flopping around that may have
 
02:14:23.030 --> 02:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
devalued the vehicle some
 
02:14:26.149 --> 02:14:26.159 align:start position:0%
thank you representative thompson
 
02:14:28.550 --> 02:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
um it seems to me like
 
02:14:30.229 --> 02:14:30.239 align:start position:0%
the problem here is going to be that the
 
02:14:32.390 --> 02:14:32.400 align:start position:0%
first line of defense
 
02:14:35.510 --> 02:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
in registering your car is a town clerk
 
02:14:37.830 --> 02:14:37.840 align:start position:0%
so who's going to get to decide whether
 
02:14:39.990 --> 02:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
you get a waiver or not is the town
 
02:14:41.750 --> 02:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
clerk going to be presented with that
 
02:14:41.760 --> 02:14:42.950 align:start position:0%
clerk going to be presented with that
waiver

02:14:42.950 --> 02:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
waiver
 
02:14:45.589 --> 02:14:45.599 align:start position:0%
and is it their decision or does it have
 
02:14:47.350 --> 02:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
to go to motor vehicle
 
02:14:50.069 --> 02:14:50.079 align:start position:0%
before she can register your car i'll
 
02:14:51.830 --> 02:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
answer that one for you just as a matter
 
02:14:52.950 --> 02:14:52.960 align:start position:0%
of time
 
02:14:55.990 --> 02:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
um all the bill says is that you display
 
02:14:57.990 --> 02:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
the front plate so everybody will still
 
02:14:59.910 --> 02:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
be issued the two so they'll still get
 
02:15:02.790 --> 02:15:02.800 align:start position:0%
the two yeah okay plus the sticker
 
02:15:04.149 --> 02:15:04.159 align:start position:0%
well well that's true we do have the
 
02:15:06.550 --> 02:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
decal on this bill yeah
 
02:15:09.189 --> 02:15:09.199 align:start position:0%
he does have a point with the decal
 
02:15:11.510 --> 02:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um
 
02:15:11.520 --> 02:15:12.709 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um
i'm

02:15:12.709 --> 02:15:12.719 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
02:15:13.910 --> 02:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
trying to find the line number as i
 
02:15:16.470 --> 02:15:16.480 align:start position:0%
answer this question but the
 
02:15:19.109 --> 02:15:19.119 align:start position:0%
waiver request would go to the state dmv
 
02:15:21.830 --> 02:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
is was the intent and i'm if he can give
 
02:15:23.589 --> 02:15:23.599 align:start position:0%
me a minute i'll probably find where but
 
02:15:25.109 --> 02:15:25.119 align:start position:0%
that was the intent is the decal would
 
02:15:26.149 --> 02:15:26.159 align:start position:0%
come from the state and the waiver
 
02:15:28.629 --> 02:15:28.639 align:start position:0%
request would go to the state the
 
02:15:31.510 --> 02:15:31.520 align:start position:0%
process for applying for the waiver was
 
02:15:33.750 --> 02:15:33.760 align:start position:0%
modeled after the process for applying
 
02:15:36.870 --> 02:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
for a medical exemption from equipment
 
02:15:39.270 --> 02:15:39.280 align:start position:0%
which is most often used for a window
 
02:15:41.510 --> 02:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
tint but can be also
 
02:15:43.750 --> 02:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
that section of rsa can also be used for
 
02:15:46.790 --> 02:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
other medical exemptions as well
 
02:15:48.790 --> 02:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
fair enough don't bother i don't believe
 
02:15:50.470 --> 02:15:50.480 align:start position:0%
at this point
 
02:15:51.990 --> 02:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
still fair to say i was accurate saying
 
02:15:53.109 --> 02:15:53.119 align:start position:0%
you're still going to get issued two
 
02:15:53.119 --> 02:15:54.470 align:start position:0%
you're still going to get issued two
plates

02:15:54.470 --> 02:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
plates
 
02:15:56.310 --> 02:15:56.320 align:start position:0%
at the time of registration there would
 
02:15:57.830 --> 02:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
be nothing thank you for the question
 
02:15:58.790 --> 02:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
there'd be nothing in this bill that
 
02:16:01.750 --> 02:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
would change that correct thank you
 
02:16:03.589 --> 02:16:03.599 align:start position:0%
the sticker would only allow the
 
02:16:07.669 --> 02:16:07.679 align:start position:0%
exemption to not put one on the front
 
02:16:09.030 --> 02:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee and
 
02:16:10.550 --> 02:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
i asked for time sake
 
02:16:11.910 --> 02:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
these are a lot of
 
02:16:14.310 --> 02:16:14.320 align:start position:0%
questions on statistics and things these
 
02:16:15.990 --> 02:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
are things that we can look into before
 
02:16:18.709 --> 02:16:18.719 align:start position:0%
we execute which will not be today so
 
02:16:20.229 --> 02:16:20.239 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
02:16:21.990 --> 02:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
representative clinton i'm sorry this is
 
02:16:23.750 --> 02:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
a really good one you're gonna love it
 
02:16:23.760 --> 02:16:25.109 align:start position:0%
a really good one you're gonna love it
um

02:16:25.109 --> 02:16:25.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:27.589 --> 02:16:27.599 align:start position:0%
when you say display you don't define
 
02:16:29.430 --> 02:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
that does that mean somebody can just
 
02:16:30.550 --> 02:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
put this
 
02:16:31.990 --> 02:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
in their front mirror and it doesn't
 
02:16:34.070 --> 02:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
have to be visible
 
02:16:34.080 --> 02:16:35.190 align:start position:0%
have to be visible
and

02:16:35.190 --> 02:16:35.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:16:35.200 --> 02:16:36.070 align:start position:0%
and
if

02:16:36.070 --> 02:16:36.080 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:16:37.990 --> 02:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
that's true would you be amenable to an
 
02:16:40.070 --> 02:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
amendment to define the actual word
 
02:16:44.870 --> 02:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:46.309 --> 02:16:46.319 align:start position:0%
i'll take the question we can look into
 
02:16:48.549 --> 02:16:48.559 align:start position:0%
that it is a good point it may be very
 
02:16:51.030 --> 02:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
well covered
 
02:16:54.709 --> 02:16:54.719 align:start position:0%
and can i keep asking questions
 
02:16:54.719 --> 02:16:57.270 align:start position:0%
and can i keep asking questions
okay

02:16:57.270 --> 02:16:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:58.790 --> 02:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
i'll give you one more
 
02:17:00.950 --> 02:17:00.960 align:start position:0%
um have you thank you fair enough have
 
02:17:03.349 --> 02:17:03.359 align:start position:0%
you worked with the dmv at all to know
 
02:17:05.110 --> 02:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
how much the cost is going to be to the
 
02:17:09.190 --> 02:17:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:11.429 --> 02:17:11.439 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:17:13.270 --> 02:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
i believe that is fairly well covered in
 
02:17:15.030 --> 02:17:15.040 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note of the bill
 
02:17:15.040 --> 02:17:16.870 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note of the bill
um

02:17:16.870 --> 02:17:16.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:18.230 --> 02:17:18.240 align:start position:0%
the i would
 
02:17:19.830 --> 02:17:19.840 align:start position:0%
i would want to work with the state more
 
02:17:21.429 --> 02:17:21.439 align:start position:0%
to find out whether their initial
 
02:17:23.429 --> 02:17:23.439 align:start position:0%
purchase number is appropriate and that
 
02:17:25.190 --> 02:17:25.200 align:start position:0%
goes i think to some of your some of the
 
02:17:26.709 --> 02:17:26.719 align:start position:0%
questions earlier about do we know how
 
02:17:28.790 --> 02:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
many people will be wanting to apply for
 
02:17:28.800 --> 02:17:29.509 align:start position:0%
many people will be wanting to apply for
this

02:17:29.509 --> 02:17:29.519 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:17:31.110 --> 02:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
you know which goes to how much initial
 
02:17:32.870 --> 02:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
stock they would have to buy
 
02:17:35.270 --> 02:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
but the fiscal note does cover
 
02:17:37.669 --> 02:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
the topic of buying the initial stock of
 
02:17:40.870 --> 02:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
the decal stickers
 
02:17:42.469 --> 02:17:42.479 align:start position:0%
in terms of those questions we do have
 
02:17:44.389 --> 02:17:44.399 align:start position:0%
other people that are signed up that may
 
02:17:46.629 --> 02:17:46.639 align:start position:0%
be able to answer them thank you so much
 
02:17:48.469 --> 02:17:48.479 align:start position:0%
uh any further questions for the
 
02:17:48.479 --> 02:17:49.750 align:start position:0%
uh any further questions for the
representative

02:17:49.750 --> 02:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:17:58.549 --> 02:17:58.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:00.790 --> 02:18:00.800 align:start position:0%
our chair recognizes
 
02:18:03.509 --> 02:18:03.519 align:start position:0%
it looks like john drury
 
02:18:05.910 --> 02:18:05.920 align:start position:0%
uh chief of police association opposed
 
02:18:22.709 --> 02:18:22.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:24.870 --> 02:18:24.880 align:start position:0%
should see a red light thank you good
 
02:18:26.790 --> 02:18:26.800 align:start position:0%
morning uh
 
02:18:29.030 --> 02:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh chairman and members of the committee
 
02:18:31.429 --> 02:18:31.439 align:start position:0%
um i do have some uh documentation here
 
02:18:34.389 --> 02:18:34.399 align:start position:0%
as well i i won't bore you with it um
 
02:18:37.110 --> 02:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
you saw me last year um
 
02:18:39.589 --> 02:18:39.599 align:start position:0%
on the same testimony i have tweaked it
 
02:18:40.629 --> 02:18:40.639 align:start position:0%
a little bit
 
02:18:42.950 --> 02:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
but these copies are are obviously
 
02:18:45.750 --> 02:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
we i can pass them out as well
 
02:18:47.270 --> 02:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
my name is john drury and i'm the chief
 
02:18:49.270 --> 02:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
of police of farmington new hampshire
 
02:18:51.030 --> 02:18:51.040 align:start position:0%
i've just started my 23rd year in law
 
02:18:53.349 --> 02:18:53.359 align:start position:0%
enforcement i am here to testify in
 
02:18:57.270 --> 02:18:57.280 align:start position:0%
opposition to bill hb 1138 fn relative
 
02:18:59.110 --> 02:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
to number plates for motor vehicles on
 
02:19:00.790 --> 02:19:00.800 align:start position:0%
behalf of myself and new hampshire
 
02:19:02.870 --> 02:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
chiefs of police association
 
02:19:04.230 --> 02:19:04.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me to address
 
02:19:06.469 --> 02:19:06.479 align:start position:0%
this bill as a car guy
 
02:19:09.830 --> 02:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
i dislike the front plate
 
02:19:11.509 --> 02:19:11.519 align:start position:0%
as a police officer and a member of the
 
02:19:13.509 --> 02:19:13.519 align:start position:0%
regional accident reconstruction team i
 
02:19:15.669 --> 02:19:15.679 align:start position:0%
must admit i love them
 
02:19:17.190 --> 02:19:17.200 align:start position:0%
over the years the front plate has made
 
02:19:20.790 --> 02:19:20.800 align:start position:0%
my job much easier route 11 75 and 153
 
02:19:22.469 --> 02:19:22.479 align:start position:0%
are main state roads that run through
 
02:19:24.469 --> 02:19:24.479 align:start position:0%
farmington when a neighboring police
 
02:19:26.230 --> 02:19:26.240 align:start position:0%
department issues a bolo
 
02:19:28.389 --> 02:19:28.399 align:start position:0%
be on the lookout for
 
02:19:29.910 --> 02:19:29.920 align:start position:0%
we head out onto the roads and try to
 
02:19:32.469 --> 02:19:32.479 align:start position:0%
find that car if we were to be looking
 
02:19:34.309 --> 02:19:34.319 align:start position:0%
for a red toyota prius with only rear
 
02:19:35.830 --> 02:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
plates on it it would be difficult to
 
02:19:37.429 --> 02:19:37.439 align:start position:0%
find as we would have to position
 
02:19:39.110 --> 02:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
ourselves in a location
 
02:19:41.509 --> 02:19:41.519 align:start position:0%
to try and observe these as most rear
 
02:19:43.990 --> 02:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
plates are recessed under the trunk lid
 
02:19:46.389 --> 02:19:46.399 align:start position:0%
or a hatch or a space uh in the rear
 
02:19:46.399 --> 02:19:48.630 align:start position:0%
or a hatch or a space uh in the rear
bumper

02:19:48.630 --> 02:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
bumper
 
02:19:50.469 --> 02:19:50.479 align:start position:0%
or we just spin around and try to get
 
02:19:52.710 --> 02:19:52.720 align:start position:0%
behind the car to read the plate imagine
 
02:19:54.630 --> 02:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
trying to do this during rush hour with
 
02:19:56.469 --> 02:19:56.479 align:start position:0%
a long line of traffic all going 50
 
02:19:58.389 --> 02:19:58.399 align:start position:0%
miles per hour or more
 
02:19:59.990 --> 02:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
watching a car pass you and then seeing
 
02:20:02.469 --> 02:20:02.479 align:start position:0%
the plate get smaller and smaller
 
02:20:04.630 --> 02:20:04.640 align:start position:0%
the state now issues a seven digit plate
 
02:20:07.349 --> 02:20:07.359 align:start position:0%
and this can be very challenging
 
02:20:09.190 --> 02:20:09.200 align:start position:0%
new hampshire plates are reflective and
 
02:20:11.670 --> 02:20:11.680 align:start position:0%
stand out very well they're easy to read
 
02:20:13.670 --> 02:20:13.680 align:start position:0%
day or night many times during a
 
02:20:15.270 --> 02:20:15.280 align:start position:0%
collision the front plate gets left
 
02:20:17.349 --> 02:20:17.359 align:start position:0%
behind at the scene or gets missed or it
 
02:20:19.270 --> 02:20:19.280 align:start position:0%
gets imprinted into other vehicles like
 
02:20:21.830 --> 02:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
a stamp we've saw many hit and runs this
 
02:20:24.309 --> 02:20:24.319 align:start position:0%
way when we could read this or find the
 
02:20:27.110 --> 02:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
plate this can also happen in load speed
 
02:20:28.950 --> 02:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
crashes i personally witnessed one at
 
02:20:30.710 --> 02:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
about 15 miles an hour it was
 
02:20:32.469 --> 02:20:32.479 align:start position:0%
unbelievable i was standing right there
 
02:20:35.110 --> 02:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
the car slid into another vehicle and
 
02:20:37.190 --> 02:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
that plate imprinted on the bumper of
 
02:20:38.630 --> 02:20:38.640 align:start position:0%
the other car
 
02:20:38.640 --> 02:20:41.349 align:start position:0%
the other car
perfectly

02:20:41.349 --> 02:20:41.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:43.190 --> 02:20:43.200 align:start position:0%
a car that is involved in a robbery
 
02:20:44.950 --> 02:20:44.960 align:start position:0%
often pulls into a business and with
 
02:20:46.630 --> 02:20:46.640 align:start position:0%
that video equipment we can read the
 
02:20:48.070 --> 02:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
plate and get a good description of the
 
02:20:48.080 --> 02:20:49.190 align:start position:0%
plate and get a good description of the
car

02:20:49.190 --> 02:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
car
 
02:20:51.030 --> 02:20:51.040 align:start position:0%
banks do a great job of capturing the
 
02:20:53.349 --> 02:20:53.359 align:start position:0%
front plate and the driver but not so
 
02:20:55.270 --> 02:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
much the rear of the car
 
02:20:57.429 --> 02:20:57.439 align:start position:0%
if a vehicle has a trailer on it forget
 
02:20:58.950 --> 02:20:58.960 align:start position:0%
it about getting that rear plate
 
02:21:00.870 --> 02:21:00.880 align:start position:0%
information and especially at the tolls
 
02:21:02.550 --> 02:21:02.560 align:start position:0%
this would cost the state a lot of money
 
02:21:04.710 --> 02:21:04.720 align:start position:0%
at lost toll revenue
 
02:21:06.790 --> 02:21:06.800 align:start position:0%
aerodynamically i spoke to a mechanical
 
02:21:08.870 --> 02:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
engineer on our tar team
 
02:21:10.389 --> 02:21:10.399 align:start position:0%
wind drag
 
02:21:12.230 --> 02:21:12.240 align:start position:0%
is a function of square feet of surface
 
02:21:14.070 --> 02:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
area and it won't bore you with it but
 
02:21:15.750 --> 02:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
when you have a very small license plate
 
02:21:18.950 --> 02:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
followed by a huge bumper and a radiator
 
02:21:20.630 --> 02:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
and all of the equipment behind that
 
02:21:21.750 --> 02:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
pushing that
 
02:21:23.510 --> 02:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
small license plate through the air that
 
02:21:25.110 --> 02:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
is a negligible
 
02:21:27.750 --> 02:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
amount of aerodynamics and we even
 
02:21:30.790 --> 02:21:30.800 align:start position:0%
discussed that 5 psi
 
02:21:33.349 --> 02:21:33.359 align:start position:0%
loss in tire pressure would be far more
 
02:21:35.590 --> 02:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
than pushing that small front plate
 
02:21:38.870 --> 02:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:41.590 --> 02:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
putting a decal on a vehicle um instead
 
02:21:43.510 --> 02:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
of a front plate in my opinion will not
 
02:21:45.750 --> 02:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
work as we will not see it at night can
 
02:21:47.270 --> 02:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
you imagine having only one plate on
 
02:21:49.510 --> 02:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
your car and yes you have the decal but
 
02:21:50.950 --> 02:21:50.960 align:start position:0%
you keep getting pulled over by law
 
02:21:53.190 --> 02:21:53.200 align:start position:0%
enforcement because we can't
 
02:21:55.830 --> 02:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
we can't see it at night we're all
 
02:21:57.590 --> 02:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
we're just focused you know i'm looking
 
02:21:59.910 --> 02:21:59.920 align:start position:0%
for that front plate and trying to
 
02:21:59.920 --> 02:22:01.030 align:start position:0%
for that front plate and trying to
discover

02:22:01.030 --> 02:22:01.040 align:start position:0%
discover
 
02:22:02.710 --> 02:22:02.720 align:start position:0%
you know the plate and sometimes you
 
02:22:05.030 --> 02:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
just memorize the last four of a bolo
 
02:22:06.870 --> 02:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
vehicle so
 
02:22:08.469 --> 02:22:08.479 align:start position:0%
the first three may not be quite so
 
02:22:09.990 --> 02:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
important so you're looking at the last
 
02:22:11.670 --> 02:22:11.680 align:start position:0%
four of the plate trying to determine
 
02:22:13.910 --> 02:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
that vehicle and then going okay this
 
02:22:15.590 --> 02:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
matches the car i'm looking for and then
 
02:22:18.630 --> 02:22:18.640 align:start position:0%
verifying the whole license plate
 
02:22:20.150 --> 02:22:20.160 align:start position:0%
um now
 
02:22:21.910 --> 02:22:21.920 align:start position:0%
now as uh
 
02:22:24.469 --> 02:22:24.479 align:start position:0%
the representatives said or i apologize
 
02:22:26.309 --> 02:22:26.319 align:start position:0%
one of your questions was after market
 
02:22:29.110 --> 02:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
products um there are some
 
02:22:31.750 --> 02:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
uh they attach if you look on your car
 
02:22:35.510 --> 02:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
you see a small little um
 
02:22:37.510 --> 02:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
square on the front bumper of your car
 
02:22:39.030 --> 02:22:39.040 align:start position:0%
that's where the tow hooks so if you
 
02:22:41.270 --> 02:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
were to need a tow
 
02:22:43.830 --> 02:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
they popped that off attached to your
 
02:22:45.990 --> 02:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
tow hooks on the front of your car and
 
02:22:48.309 --> 02:22:48.319 align:start position:0%
they've been ingenious in making those
 
02:22:50.309 --> 02:22:50.319 align:start position:0%
so now your front bla you have a after
 
02:22:52.950 --> 02:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
market bracket that can fit into that
 
02:22:54.950 --> 02:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
and not damage your bumper and that was
 
02:22:56.309 --> 02:22:56.319 align:start position:0%
something different from from last
 
02:23:00.070 --> 02:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:03.110 --> 02:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
so i just wanted to hope
 
02:23:05.190 --> 02:23:05.200 align:start position:0%
in closing i must oppose this bill for
 
02:23:07.190 --> 02:23:07.200 align:start position:0%
the safety of the public it outweighs my
 
02:23:10.550 --> 02:23:10.560 align:start position:0%
car guy vanity i do like cars
 
02:23:12.070 --> 02:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
and trust me it
 
02:23:14.469 --> 02:23:14.479 align:start position:0%
it does pain me with a front plate but
 
02:23:17.349 --> 02:23:17.359 align:start position:0%
the benefits so much outweigh um that
 
02:23:19.429 --> 02:23:19.439 align:start position:0%
that little problem that i have with the
 
02:23:22.550 --> 02:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
front plate uh and it has just helped us
 
02:23:24.469 --> 02:23:24.479 align:start position:0%
in my career
 
02:23:26.870 --> 02:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
countless times of having that front
 
02:23:28.870 --> 02:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
plate there making it our job a lot
 
02:23:30.790 --> 02:23:30.800 align:start position:0%
easier i thank you very much for
 
02:23:33.429 --> 02:23:33.439 align:start position:0%
allowing me the opportunity to testify
 
02:23:35.750 --> 02:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh on this on behalf of this bill
 
02:23:37.590 --> 02:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
and uh in opposing it and i would
 
02:23:39.030 --> 02:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
respectfully ask
 
02:23:41.270 --> 02:23:41.280 align:start position:0%
that you find it in
 
02:23:42.950 --> 02:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate and thank you so
 
02:23:45.349 --> 02:23:45.359 align:start position:0%
much for your time
 
02:23:46.790 --> 02:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
i'd be more than happy to take any
 
02:23:48.710 --> 02:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
questions if you have any yep thank you
 
02:23:50.150 --> 02:23:50.160 align:start position:0%
just one question for me does the
 
02:23:52.230 --> 02:23:52.240 align:start position:0%
federal government state law or the
 
02:23:52.240 --> 02:23:53.750 align:start position:0%
federal government state law or the
manufacturers

02:23:53.750 --> 02:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
manufacturers
 
02:23:55.830 --> 02:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
illuminate the front plates at night
 
02:23:57.910 --> 02:23:57.920 align:start position:0%
that that is not a requirement only the
 
02:23:59.990 --> 02:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
rear plate has a plate light so the
 
02:24:01.670 --> 02:24:01.680 align:start position:0%
front plate is not required to be
 
02:24:03.910 --> 02:24:03.920 align:start position:0%
illuminated and like i say our plates
 
02:24:04.790 --> 02:24:04.800 align:start position:0%
with the
 
02:24:07.190 --> 02:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
the green and white they stand out so
 
02:24:07.200 --> 02:24:08.550 align:start position:0%
the green and white they stand out so
well

02:24:08.550 --> 02:24:08.560 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:24:10.150 --> 02:24:10.160 align:start position:0%
thank you it just isn't needed
 
02:24:16.550 --> 02:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:17.910 --> 02:24:17.920 align:start position:0%
sorry about that thank you for taking my
 
02:24:19.670 --> 02:24:19.680 align:start position:0%
question you said that seeing a sticker
 
02:24:21.030 --> 02:24:21.040 align:start position:0%
would be hard at night but how would you
 
02:24:22.870 --> 02:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
how do you see inspection stickers since
 
02:24:24.150 --> 02:24:24.160 align:start position:0%
they're just little stickers in the
 
02:24:26.309 --> 02:24:26.319 align:start position:0%
bottom corner windows at night
 
02:24:28.550 --> 02:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
well i wish we were consulted in
 
02:24:30.550 --> 02:24:30.560 align:start position:0%
the inspection sticker process but to
 
02:24:34.710 --> 02:24:34.720 align:start position:0%
the best of my knowledge we weren't um i
 
02:24:36.389 --> 02:24:36.399 align:start position:0%
i will say i just like our current
 
02:24:38.469 --> 02:24:38.479 align:start position:0%
inspection stickers and i'm sure uh it
 
02:24:40.309 --> 02:24:40.319 align:start position:0%
costs the state some revenue because
 
02:24:42.950 --> 02:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
they're also hard to see
 
02:24:44.389 --> 02:24:44.399 align:start position:0%
and i would agree with you that that
 
02:24:46.469 --> 02:24:46.479 align:start position:0%
decal is is going to make our job more
 
02:24:46.479 --> 02:24:47.830 align:start position:0%
decal is is going to make our job more
difficult

02:24:47.830 --> 02:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
02:24:49.429 --> 02:24:49.439 align:start position:0%
the inspection stickers have been
 
02:24:51.510 --> 02:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
improved since that
 
02:24:54.309 --> 02:24:54.319 align:start position:0%
first go-around a couple of years ago
 
02:24:56.070 --> 02:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
but i think there's still some more room
 
02:25:00.150 --> 02:25:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:00.160 --> 02:25:01.590 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

02:25:01.590 --> 02:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:25:02.790 --> 02:25:02.800 align:start position:0%
is this something you'd be willing to
 
02:25:05.349 --> 02:25:05.359 align:start position:0%
work with us on trying to find a way
 
02:25:05.359 --> 02:25:05.700 align:start position:0%
work with us on trying to find a way
around

02:25:05.700 --> 02:25:05.710 align:start position:0%
around
 
02:25:05.710 --> 02:25:06.790 align:start position:0%
around
[Music]

02:25:06.790 --> 02:25:06.800 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:25:08.469 --> 02:25:08.479 align:start position:0%
let's find a way to get rid of the front
 
02:25:08.479 --> 02:25:10.550 align:start position:0%
let's find a way to get rid of the front
plate

02:25:10.550 --> 02:25:10.560 align:start position:0%
plate
 
02:25:11.990 --> 02:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
because it's always coming up so is that
 
02:25:12.950 --> 02:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
something you're willing to work on or
 
02:25:14.389 --> 02:25:14.399 align:start position:0%
is it something that we just can't right
 
02:25:14.399 --> 02:25:15.910 align:start position:0%
is it something that we just can't right
now

02:25:15.910 --> 02:25:15.920 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:25:18.389 --> 02:25:18.399 align:start position:0%
i i think it would be very difficult i'm
 
02:25:20.070 --> 02:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
always willing to work with anybody on
 
02:25:22.389 --> 02:25:22.399 align:start position:0%
anything to solve any problem
 
02:25:23.750 --> 02:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
but i just
 
02:25:25.510 --> 02:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
the front plate is just such a benefit
 
02:25:28.150 --> 02:25:28.160 align:start position:0%
to us i i just think uh i think we have
 
02:25:29.990 --> 02:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
to keep things the way they are thank
 
02:25:32.230 --> 02:25:32.240 align:start position:0%
you though for the question all right
 
02:25:34.630 --> 02:25:34.640 align:start position:0%
um we do have other people
 
02:25:37.429 --> 02:25:37.439 align:start position:0%
from departments signed up to speak
 
02:25:37.439 --> 02:25:41.670 align:start position:0%
from departments signed up to speak
in speaker

02:25:41.670 --> 02:25:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:43.030 --> 02:25:43.040 align:start position:0%
excuse me chief could if you have
 
02:25:44.630 --> 02:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
written testimony could i get a copy of
 
02:25:47.190 --> 02:25:47.200 align:start position:0%
that most definitely i apologize i'd be
 
02:25:48.790 --> 02:25:48.800 align:start position:0%
more than happy to pass it out i have
 
02:25:51.030 --> 02:25:51.040 align:start position:0%
several copies here and would be uh
 
02:25:53.670 --> 02:25:53.680 align:start position:0%
would be an honor to share them with you

02:25:55.040 --> 02:25:56.389 align:start position:0%

good morning mr chairman members of the

good morning mr chairman members of the

02:26:14.389 --> 02:26:14.399 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:26:15.830 --> 02:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
my name is lieutenant james o'leary from
 
02:26:17.830 --> 02:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
the hampshire state police troop g
 
02:26:19.510 --> 02:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
and the chiefs of police association
 
02:26:20.790 --> 02:26:20.800 align:start position:0%
just took away everything that i have to
 
02:26:20.800 --> 02:26:23.830 align:start position:0%
just took away everything that i have to
say

02:26:23.830 --> 02:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:25.429 --> 02:26:25.439 align:start position:0%
so i know that you have other people to
 
02:26:27.270 --> 02:26:27.280 align:start position:0%
speak the only part that i will share
 
02:26:28.870 --> 02:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
with you is this
 
02:26:30.550 --> 02:26:30.560 align:start position:0%
i've worked a number of years in
 
02:26:32.309 --> 02:26:32.319 align:start position:0%
collision analysis reconstruction and
 
02:26:33.830 --> 02:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
can attest to the fact that there are
 
02:26:35.349 --> 02:26:35.359 align:start position:0%
license plates that do get left at
 
02:26:35.359 --> 02:26:36.230 align:start position:0%
license plates that do get left at
scenes

02:26:36.230 --> 02:26:36.240 align:start position:0%
scenes
 
02:26:38.150 --> 02:26:38.160 align:start position:0%
because of those those rear collisions
 
02:26:40.070 --> 02:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
in addition to that i worked a number of
 
02:26:42.150 --> 02:26:42.160 align:start position:0%
years as a homicide investigator and we
 
02:26:44.790 --> 02:26:44.800 align:start position:0%
rely heavily on surveillance video cell
 
02:26:47.270 --> 02:26:47.280 align:start position:0%
phone video and eyewitness testimony
 
02:26:48.790 --> 02:26:48.800 align:start position:0%
when it comes to identifying vehicles
 
02:26:50.950 --> 02:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
involved in crimes and obviously having
 
02:26:52.630 --> 02:26:52.640 align:start position:0%
that front license plate is very
 
02:26:55.510 --> 02:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
advantageous for us for that so
 
02:26:57.110 --> 02:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
 
02:26:57.120 --> 02:26:58.870 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
committee

02:26:58.870 --> 02:26:58.880 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:27:00.550 --> 02:27:00.560 align:start position:0%
representative palerski thank you i'll
 
02:27:02.150 --> 02:27:02.160 align:start position:0%
be very quick um the only thing that
 
02:27:03.670 --> 02:27:03.680 align:start position:0%
hasn't come up that i know we've heard
 
02:27:05.270 --> 02:27:05.280 align:start position:0%
in the past and i just want to verify
 
02:27:08.469 --> 02:27:08.479 align:start position:0%
i'm correct in my memory um amber alerts
 
02:27:09.830 --> 02:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
i know that when an amber alert is
 
02:27:11.670 --> 02:27:11.680 align:start position:0%
issued your point is to reach out to the
 
02:27:13.110 --> 02:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
general public and i know the general
 
02:27:15.110 --> 02:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
public isn't always necessarily behind a
 
02:27:17.110 --> 02:27:17.120 align:start position:0%
vehicle as a cruiser might be
 
02:27:19.349 --> 02:27:19.359 align:start position:0%
do you think the front plate is vital
 
02:27:21.510 --> 02:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
for the public to identify amber alert
 
02:27:22.630 --> 02:27:22.640 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am thank you for your question
 
02:27:24.070 --> 02:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what happens in an amber
 
02:27:25.510 --> 02:27:25.520 align:start position:0%
alert that gets messaged out to the
 
02:27:27.270 --> 02:27:27.280 align:start position:0%
public and we rely solely on the public
 
02:27:30.070 --> 02:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
to attempt to locate that vehicle so if
 
02:27:31.750 --> 02:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
that front plate is there it does make
 
02:27:33.990 --> 02:27:34.000 align:start position:0%
it easier for the public to find that
 
02:27:36.230 --> 02:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
vehicle for us thank you
 
02:27:38.070 --> 02:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
02:27:39.910 --> 02:27:39.920 align:start position:0%
representative crawford
 
02:27:43.030 --> 02:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you lieutenant
 
02:27:45.190 --> 02:27:45.200 align:start position:0%
license plate readers we allow those in
 
02:27:47.190 --> 02:27:47.200 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire
 
02:27:48.870 --> 02:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
as of right now i believe we're working
 
02:27:50.790 --> 02:27:50.800 align:start position:0%
on language regarding that but we do not
 
02:27:53.830 --> 02:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
have any that that are uh
 
02:27:56.630 --> 02:27:56.640 align:start position:0%
so if we if if departments do have them
 
02:27:58.150 --> 02:27:58.160 align:start position:0%
would they be reading just the front
 
02:28:00.790 --> 02:28:00.800 align:start position:0%
license plate or do they read both
 
02:28:02.150 --> 02:28:02.160 align:start position:0%
i apologize i don't know the answer to
 
02:28:03.270 --> 02:28:03.280 align:start position:0%
that question as far as how that
 
02:28:04.790 --> 02:28:04.800 align:start position:0%
technology works if they read both
 
02:28:06.870 --> 02:28:06.880 align:start position:0%
plates thank you okay
 
02:28:09.429 --> 02:28:09.439 align:start position:0%

02:28:27.190 --> 02:28:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:28.630 --> 02:28:28.640 align:start position:0%
good morning again mr chairman of
 
02:28:30.630 --> 02:28:30.640 align:start position:0%
members of the committee i'll make my
 
02:28:30.640 --> 02:28:32.150 align:start position:0%
members of the committee i'll make my
um

02:28:32.150 --> 02:28:32.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:34.630 --> 02:28:34.640 align:start position:0%
my part brief as well and i look at this
 
02:28:36.309 --> 02:28:36.319 align:start position:0%
from a different perspective i look at
 
02:28:37.750 --> 02:28:37.760 align:start position:0%
this from the guy who's got to manage
 
02:28:39.270 --> 02:28:39.280 align:start position:0%
this program
 
02:28:41.429 --> 02:28:41.439 align:start position:0%
um and whenever we see programs that
 
02:28:43.110 --> 02:28:43.120 align:start position:0%
come through like this waiver programs
 
02:28:44.630 --> 02:28:44.640 align:start position:0%
we want to run from the room for this
 
02:28:47.110 --> 02:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
for the for the ambiguity that that's in
 
02:28:49.110 --> 02:28:49.120 align:start position:0%
the in the language here and
 
02:28:51.990 --> 02:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
this is an unenforceable act
 
02:28:54.630 --> 02:28:54.640 align:start position:0%
for us because of the am
 
02:28:56.790 --> 02:28:56.800 align:start position:0%
the ambiguous language
 
02:28:59.510 --> 02:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
what's to prevent me from denying the
 
02:29:02.550 --> 02:29:02.560 align:start position:0%
owner of a 2012 subaru forester from
 
02:29:05.510 --> 02:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
saying that it's not a collectible
 
02:29:07.990 --> 02:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
so if i deny somebody that sticker there
 
02:29:09.750 --> 02:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
is a hearings there's an administrative
 
02:29:11.270 --> 02:29:11.280 align:start position:0%
hearings process
 
02:29:13.429 --> 02:29:13.439 align:start position:0%
in which every citizen has the right
 
02:29:15.590 --> 02:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
when denied a product what is my
 
02:29:18.790 --> 02:29:18.800 align:start position:0%
defensible point from this this program
 
02:29:20.389 --> 02:29:20.399 align:start position:0%
so basically what i'm saying is this is
 
02:29:22.710 --> 02:29:22.720 align:start position:0%
an undefensible program for anybody that
 
02:29:24.309 --> 02:29:24.319 align:start position:0%
wants to apply
 
02:29:25.910 --> 02:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
because collectible is in the eye of the
 
02:29:25.920 --> 02:29:27.270 align:start position:0%
because collectible is in the eye of the
beholder

02:29:27.270 --> 02:29:27.280 align:start position:0%
beholder
 
02:29:29.110 --> 02:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
value is in the eye of the beholder
 
02:29:30.630 --> 02:29:30.640 align:start position:0%
there is no
 
02:29:30.640 --> 02:29:31.750 align:start position:0%
there is no
set

02:29:31.750 --> 02:29:31.760 align:start position:0%
set
 
02:29:34.230 --> 02:29:34.240 align:start position:0%
program rules or regulations in play
 
02:29:36.950 --> 02:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
that defines what is collectible
 
02:29:39.110 --> 02:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
and having said that i'll keep it at
 
02:29:40.550 --> 02:29:40.560 align:start position:0%
that and i'll open it up to any
 
02:29:40.560 --> 02:29:41.830 align:start position:0%
that and i'll open it up to any
questions

02:29:41.830 --> 02:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:29:43.110 --> 02:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
thank you sir questions from the
 
02:29:47.349 --> 02:29:47.359 align:start position:0%
committee representative o'hara
 
02:29:49.030 --> 02:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um and thank you
 
02:29:50.870 --> 02:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
for taking my question would you be open
 
02:29:53.270 --> 02:29:53.280 align:start position:0%
to working with us on
 
02:29:53.280 --> 02:29:54.790 align:start position:0%
to working with us on
defining

02:29:54.790 --> 02:29:54.800 align:start position:0%
defining
 
02:29:58.389 --> 02:29:58.399 align:start position:0%
what is uh collectible what is you know
 
02:30:00.469 --> 02:30:00.479 align:start position:0%
the devaluing so we can get to a point
 
02:30:02.150 --> 02:30:02.160 align:start position:0%
where we know which type of vehicles
 
02:30:03.510 --> 02:30:03.520 align:start position:0%
they're targeting
 
02:30:05.750 --> 02:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
for not having front plates and
 
02:30:07.349 --> 02:30:07.359 align:start position:0%
it's the more the ferrari stuff like
 
02:30:07.359 --> 02:30:08.230 align:start position:0%
it's the more the ferrari stuff like
that

02:30:08.230 --> 02:30:08.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:30:10.070 --> 02:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
not the subaru foresters and we know
 
02:30:12.070 --> 02:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
that so were you are you able to work
 
02:30:14.230 --> 02:30:14.240 align:start position:0%
with us on maybe defining these words
 
02:30:16.230 --> 02:30:16.240 align:start position:0%
and getting something that could
 
02:30:18.550 --> 02:30:18.560 align:start position:0%
pass for this sure if there's if there's
 
02:30:20.150 --> 02:30:20.160 align:start position:0%
language that exists that would get us
 
02:30:22.469 --> 02:30:22.479 align:start position:0%
closer to a definition of a program that
 
02:30:23.910 --> 02:30:23.920 align:start position:0%
we could actually
 
02:30:25.910 --> 02:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
adhere to i think we all think a model t
 
02:30:28.550 --> 02:30:28.560 align:start position:0%
or a ferrari is what we're talking about
 
02:30:30.550 --> 02:30:30.560 align:start position:0%
here but the language doesn't say that
 
02:30:33.429 --> 02:30:33.439 align:start position:0%
fair enough representative fenton
 
02:30:35.349 --> 02:30:35.359 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for taking my question
 
02:30:37.429 --> 02:30:37.439 align:start position:0%
hypothetically let's say i own a car
 
02:30:37.439 --> 02:30:38.550 align:start position:0%
hypothetically let's say i own a car
dealership

02:30:38.550 --> 02:30:38.560 align:start position:0%
dealership
 
02:30:41.030 --> 02:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
could i charge people for this waiver
 
02:30:43.270 --> 02:30:43.280 align:start position:0%
and approve any car
 
02:30:45.590 --> 02:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
uh not according to this waiver it is it
 
02:30:47.190 --> 02:30:47.200 align:start position:0%
appears to be a department program in
 
02:30:49.190 --> 02:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
the 15 fee shall cover the cost of the
 
02:30:49.200 --> 02:30:50.150 align:start position:0%
the 15 fee shall cover the cost of the
sticker

02:30:50.150 --> 02:30:50.160 align:start position:0%
sticker
 
02:30:50.160 --> 02:30:51.190 align:start position:0%
sticker
um

02:30:51.190 --> 02:30:51.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:30:55.910 --> 02:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:58.070 --> 02:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
representative palersky
 
02:30:59.110 --> 02:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
02:31:01.110 --> 02:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
question um i
 
02:31:03.750 --> 02:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
pulled up the notes on house bill 260 fn
 
02:31:06.070 --> 02:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
from last year which um
 
02:31:09.429 --> 02:31:09.439 align:start position:0%
was amended by this committee to have a
 
02:31:11.510 --> 02:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
rear plate only for collectibles hot
 
02:31:14.389 --> 02:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
rods and i think antique vehicles and
 
02:31:14.399 --> 02:31:15.190 align:start position:0%
rods and i think antique vehicles and
the

02:31:15.190 --> 02:31:15.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:31:15.200 --> 02:31:16.309 align:start position:0%
the
senate

02:31:16.309 --> 02:31:16.319 align:start position:0%
senate
 
02:31:19.830 --> 02:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:22.070 --> 02:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
giving it an itl recommendation and it
 
02:31:24.070 --> 02:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
failed the senate
 
02:31:26.469 --> 02:31:26.479 align:start position:0%
primarily because of toll problems
 
02:31:29.030 --> 02:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
collect collections of tolls can you
 
02:31:31.270 --> 02:31:31.280 align:start position:0%
expand a little bit on that and the
 
02:31:34.230 --> 02:31:34.240 align:start position:0%
possible fiscal impact um
 
02:31:35.830 --> 02:31:35.840 align:start position:0%
of cars that don't have a front plate
 
02:31:37.750 --> 02:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
for reading by the tolls
 
02:31:40.389 --> 02:31:40.399 align:start position:0%
i don't know if that's your purview
 
02:31:41.750 --> 02:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
i think that's a that's a department of
 
02:31:44.230 --> 02:31:44.240 align:start position:0%
transportation say i will say that we
 
02:31:46.870 --> 02:31:46.880 align:start position:0%
are the end point once again
 
02:31:48.469 --> 02:31:48.479 align:start position:0%
for the department of transportation
 
02:31:50.550 --> 02:31:50.560 align:start position:0%
when it comes to suspending
 
02:31:53.030 --> 02:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
um folks who haven't paid their tolls so
 
02:31:55.190 --> 02:31:55.200 align:start position:0%
whether this adds significantly or not i
 
02:31:57.270 --> 02:31:57.280 align:start position:0%
don't think i could attest to okay thank
 
02:31:57.280 --> 02:31:59.349 align:start position:0%

02:32:06.790 --> 02:32:06.800 align:start position:0%
one more speakers come forward

in case anybody didn't know
 
02:32:36.790 --> 02:32:36.800 align:start position:0%
uh this bill for me is personal
 
02:32:40.070 --> 02:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
some of you know i own a car service
 
02:32:41.990 --> 02:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
recently i just bought a brand new
 
02:32:43.830 --> 02:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
lincoln continental i drove out to
 
02:32:45.830 --> 02:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
missouri to buy this beautiful car it's
 
02:32:45.840 --> 02:32:47.270 align:start position:0%
missouri to buy this beautiful car it's
black

02:32:47.270 --> 02:32:47.280 align:start position:0%
black
 
02:32:48.230 --> 02:32:48.240 align:start position:0%
if i
 
02:32:48.240 --> 02:32:48.950 align:start position:0%
if i
if

02:32:48.950 --> 02:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:32:51.670 --> 02:32:51.680 align:start position:0%
currently right now and
 
02:32:53.349 --> 02:32:53.359 align:start position:0%
i'm not comfortable doing this but i
 
02:32:55.110 --> 02:32:55.120 align:start position:0%
have to by law
 
02:32:57.190 --> 02:32:57.200 align:start position:0%
drill two holes in the front of that
 
02:32:57.200 --> 02:32:58.550 align:start position:0%
drill two holes in the front of that
bumper

02:32:58.550 --> 02:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
bumper
 
02:32:59.670 --> 02:32:59.680 align:start position:0%
because it didn't come with a front
 
02:33:00.950 --> 02:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
license plate
 
02:33:00.960 --> 02:33:02.309 align:start position:0%
license plate
mount

02:33:02.309 --> 02:33:02.319 align:start position:0%
mount
 
02:33:03.750 --> 02:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:33:05.590 --> 02:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
would allow me to
 
02:33:06.870 --> 02:33:06.880 align:start position:0%
wave that
 
02:33:09.830 --> 02:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
now keep in mind motorcycles don't have
 
02:33:10.950 --> 02:33:10.960 align:start position:0%
this issue
 
02:33:11.990 --> 02:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
we don't have front plates on
 
02:33:14.469 --> 02:33:14.479 align:start position:0%
motorcycles we have back plates
 
02:33:17.110 --> 02:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
so if the issue is with tolls i'm pretty
 
02:33:18.630 --> 02:33:18.640 align:start position:0%
sure the toll
 
02:33:21.910 --> 02:33:21.920 align:start position:0%
camera grabs the um
 
02:33:24.309 --> 02:33:24.319 align:start position:0%
the the back of the plate anyway
 
02:33:24.319 --> 02:33:25.110 align:start position:0%
the the back of the plate anyway
um

02:33:25.110 --> 02:33:25.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:33:25.120 --> 02:33:26.309 align:start position:0%
um
so

02:33:26.309 --> 02:33:26.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:33:28.550 --> 02:33:28.560 align:start position:0%
if that's not the problem then how are
 
02:33:30.870 --> 02:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
we if if that is a problem then how are
 
02:33:33.830 --> 02:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
we not billing for
 
02:33:35.590 --> 02:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
motorcycles that don't get captured when
 
02:33:36.710 --> 02:33:36.720 align:start position:0%
they go through the toll and they don't
 
02:33:39.349 --> 02:33:39.359 align:start position:0%
have their easy pass
 
02:33:40.550 --> 02:33:40.560 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:33:40.560 --> 02:33:41.429 align:start position:0%
this bill
really

02:33:41.429 --> 02:33:41.439 align:start position:0%
really
 
02:33:44.950 --> 02:33:44.960 align:start position:0%
is as simple as it gets
 
02:33:47.670 --> 02:33:47.680 align:start position:0%

representative ankerberg if you're going
 
02:37:58.070 --> 02:37:58.080 align:start position:0%
to introduce this right
 
02:37:59.670 --> 02:37:59.680 align:start position:0%
if you can fill out a pink card while
 
02:38:10.710 --> 02:38:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:12.550 --> 02:38:12.560 align:start position:0%
i don't like this one at all
 
02:38:23.750 --> 02:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:25.270 --> 02:38:25.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman members of the
 
02:38:25.280 --> 02:38:26.389 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman members of the
committee

02:38:26.389 --> 02:38:26.399 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:38:29.830 --> 02:38:29.840 align:start position:0%
i'm here to introduce house bill 1150
 
02:38:32.630 --> 02:38:32.640 align:start position:0%
and this is uh relative to temporary
 
02:38:35.030 --> 02:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
license plates
 
02:38:36.950 --> 02:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
and this bill would permit
 
02:38:38.950 --> 02:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
any new hampshire resident who purchases
 
02:38:41.429 --> 02:38:41.439 align:start position:0%
a motor vehicle from another individual
 
02:38:43.429 --> 02:38:43.439 align:start position:0%
to display an existing valve new
 
02:38:45.270 --> 02:38:45.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire license plate registered in
 
02:38:46.950 --> 02:38:46.960 align:start position:0%
their name for a period of five days
 
02:38:48.950 --> 02:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
from the date of sale
 
02:38:51.270 --> 02:38:51.280 align:start position:0%
so the intent of this is
 
02:38:53.110 --> 02:38:53.120 align:start position:0%
clearly you're on craigslist facebook
 
02:38:55.030 --> 02:38:55.040 align:start position:0%
marketplace something like that
 
02:38:57.429 --> 02:38:57.439 align:start position:0%
um it's late on a saturday
 
02:39:01.510 --> 02:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:03.429 --> 02:39:03.439 align:start position:0%
you you talk to the seller you like the
 
02:39:05.990 --> 02:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
car um you know most most of these
 
02:39:08.309 --> 02:39:08.319 align:start position:0%
situations you're not
 
02:39:10.469 --> 02:39:10.479 align:start position:0%
in a position where you know the person
 
02:39:12.630 --> 02:39:12.640 align:start position:0%
they're not going to hold the vehicle
 
02:39:14.230 --> 02:39:14.240 align:start position:0%
you kind of have to act on it at that
 
02:39:14.240 --> 02:39:15.190 align:start position:0%
you kind of have to act on it at that
point

02:39:15.190 --> 02:39:15.200 align:start position:0%
point
 
02:39:18.309 --> 02:39:18.319 align:start position:0%
um obviously dmv and your town clerk
 
02:39:19.590 --> 02:39:19.600 align:start position:0%
aren't open
 
02:39:21.510 --> 02:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
so how do you get a temp tag
 
02:39:21.520 --> 02:39:23.270 align:start position:0%
so how do you get a temp tag
right

02:39:23.270 --> 02:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:39:26.070 --> 02:39:26.080 align:start position:0%
difficult so this bill is uh seeking to
 
02:39:28.630 --> 02:39:28.640 align:start position:0%
remedy that particular issue
 
02:39:28.640 --> 02:39:29.910 align:start position:0%
remedy that particular issue
um

02:39:29.910 --> 02:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:39:32.710 --> 02:39:32.720 align:start position:0%
just uh i i would see a couple of issues
 
02:39:35.750 --> 02:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
with the bill as it's as it's written
 
02:39:37.750 --> 02:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
maybe we can fix some of these maybe the
 
02:39:40.389 --> 02:39:40.399 align:start position:0%
committee can fix these
 
02:39:42.230 --> 02:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
there is an issue
 
02:39:44.469 --> 02:39:44.479 align:start position:0%
on line four any resident of this state
 
02:39:46.550 --> 02:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
who purchases a motor vehicle in another
 
02:39:48.389 --> 02:39:48.399 align:start position:0%
state from another person i would think
 
02:39:50.630 --> 02:39:50.640 align:start position:0%
that it might be
 
02:39:53.190 --> 02:39:53.200 align:start position:0%
sort of a problem if police in another
 
02:39:55.750 --> 02:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
out-of-state jurisdiction um
 
02:39:57.830 --> 02:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
notice that you're driving around on a
 
02:39:59.349 --> 02:39:59.359 align:start position:0%
you know in a vehicle with a plate
 
02:40:01.349 --> 02:40:01.359 align:start position:0%
registered to another car
 
02:40:03.270 --> 02:40:03.280 align:start position:0%
um it could be a problem you're probably
 
02:40:05.990 --> 02:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
gonna get pulled out of that car
 
02:40:08.070 --> 02:40:08.080 align:start position:0%
further investigation
 
02:40:08.080 --> 02:40:09.190 align:start position:0%
further investigation
also

02:40:09.190 --> 02:40:09.200 align:start position:0%
also
 
02:40:11.510 --> 02:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in the bill
 
02:40:11.520 --> 02:40:13.590 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in the bill
requiring

02:40:13.590 --> 02:40:13.600 align:start position:0%
requiring
 
02:40:15.590 --> 02:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
a bill of sale
 
02:40:17.349 --> 02:40:17.359 align:start position:0%
and how that would be
 
02:40:17.359 --> 02:40:18.710 align:start position:0%
and how that would be
authenticated

02:40:18.710 --> 02:40:18.720 align:start position:0%
authenticated
 
02:40:21.030 --> 02:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
to prevent folks from simply at the end
 
02:40:23.110 --> 02:40:23.120 align:start position:0%
of the five-day period simply writing a
 
02:40:25.110 --> 02:40:25.120 align:start position:0%
new bill of sale
 
02:40:27.269 --> 02:40:27.279 align:start position:0%
um and just going on and on with that
 
02:40:27.279 --> 02:40:28.630 align:start position:0%
um and just going on and on with that
process

02:40:28.630 --> 02:40:28.640 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:40:31.030 --> 02:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
there would be no way to authenticate
 
02:40:31.040 --> 02:40:31.830 align:start position:0%
there would be no way to authenticate
that

02:40:31.830 --> 02:40:31.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:40:34.630 --> 02:40:34.640 align:start position:0%
you know bill of sale would be um valid
 
02:40:34.640 --> 02:40:35.910 align:start position:0%
you know bill of sale would be um valid
so

02:40:35.910 --> 02:40:35.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:40:38.150 --> 02:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
with with that said i i like the idea
 
02:40:40.230 --> 02:40:40.240 align:start position:0%
and hopefully the committee can work on
 
02:40:40.240 --> 02:40:42.469 align:start position:0%
and hopefully the committee can work on
it

02:40:42.469 --> 02:40:42.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:43.670 --> 02:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
 
02:40:43.680 --> 02:40:45.269 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
committee

02:40:45.269 --> 02:40:45.279 align:start position:0%

02:40:45.279 --> 02:40:47.750 align:start position:0%
committee
representative

02:40:47.750 --> 02:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:40:48.870 --> 02:40:48.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i don't know if
 
02:40:50.870 --> 02:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
this is more of a question for the chair
 
02:40:52.230 --> 02:40:52.240 align:start position:0%
i think it'd probably be more towards
 
02:40:55.030 --> 02:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
for aiden i'm sorry representative
 
02:40:55.040 --> 02:40:56.070 align:start position:0%
for aiden i'm sorry representative
um

02:40:56.070 --> 02:40:56.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:40:57.670 --> 02:40:57.680 align:start position:0%
is if you were to get pulled up right
 
02:40:59.590 --> 02:40:59.600 align:start position:0%
now after buying a car on sunday and you
 
02:41:01.590 --> 02:41:01.600 align:start position:0%
had a bill of sale in your car and your
 
02:41:02.950 --> 02:41:02.960 align:start position:0%
old plates in the car
 
02:41:04.630 --> 02:41:04.640 align:start position:0%
what's the likelihood of that cop giving
 
02:41:06.550 --> 02:41:06.560 align:start position:0%
you that ticket
 
02:41:08.309 --> 02:41:08.319 align:start position:0%
for that if it if that bill of sale says
 
02:41:11.590 --> 02:41:11.600 align:start position:0%
that day i can't answer that that'd be a
 
02:41:12.710 --> 02:41:12.720 align:start position:0%
question for
 
02:41:14.309 --> 02:41:14.319 align:start position:0%
the department of safety perhaps one of
 
02:41:16.309 --> 02:41:16.319 align:start position:0%
our other speakers can maybe answer that
 
02:41:17.910 --> 02:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
one for you thank you any other
 
02:41:18.790 --> 02:41:18.800 align:start position:0%

if

02:41:25.590 --> 02:41:25.600 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:41:26.790 --> 02:41:26.800 align:start position:0%
i go to another state go to
 
02:41:30.070 --> 02:41:30.080 align:start position:0%
massachusetts and i see this car and i
 
02:41:31.670 --> 02:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
want to purchase it from this person
 
02:41:33.269 --> 02:41:33.279 align:start position:0%
it's a saturday evening
 
02:41:35.910 --> 02:41:35.920 align:start position:0%
and i'd say this is a second car for me
 
02:41:37.830 --> 02:41:37.840 align:start position:0%

02:41:39.990 --> 02:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
off my current car
 
02:41:41.910 --> 02:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
kind of bring them with me
 
02:41:44.230 --> 02:41:44.240 align:start position:0%
light the car and then slap him on this
 
02:41:44.240 --> 02:41:45.429 align:start position:0%
light the car and then slap him on this
car

02:41:45.429 --> 02:41:45.439 align:start position:0%
car
 
02:41:47.269 --> 02:41:47.279 align:start position:0%
and then drive home is that kind of the
 
02:41:51.030 --> 02:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:52.950 --> 02:41:52.960 align:start position:0%
the bill says that
 
02:41:55.590 --> 02:41:55.600 align:start position:0%
uh obviously there would be some issues
 
02:41:57.429 --> 02:41:57.439 align:start position:0%
with that right
 
02:42:00.070 --> 02:42:00.080 align:start position:0%
you know depending on um
 
02:42:03.269 --> 02:42:03.279 align:start position:0%
the law in the other state right so if
 
02:42:04.710 --> 02:42:04.720 align:start position:0%
we were to pass this and you're in
 
02:42:07.110 --> 02:42:07.120 align:start position:0%
another state driving an unregistered
 
02:42:08.710 --> 02:42:08.720 align:start position:0%
vehicle out of massachusetts let's say
 
02:42:10.510 --> 02:42:10.520 align:start position:0%
you know that that would present a
 
02:42:13.510 --> 02:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
problem okay thank you
 
02:42:16.150 --> 02:42:16.160 align:start position:0%

02:42:52.150 --> 02:42:52.160 align:start position:0%
the request however our biggest concern
 
02:42:53.990 --> 02:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
would be that we would have no way to
 
02:42:56.150 --> 02:42:56.160 align:start position:0%
authenticate any of the paperwork that
 
02:42:58.070 --> 02:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
the driver may have that's not required
 
02:43:00.550 --> 02:43:00.560 align:start position:0%
yet as the bill is written or able to
 
02:43:02.150 --> 02:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
run the license plate that's attached to
 
02:43:03.670 --> 02:43:03.680 align:start position:0%
the to the vehicle and have it come back
 
02:43:05.429 --> 02:43:05.439 align:start position:0%
to the proper vehicle so that those are
 
02:43:08.710 --> 02:43:08.720 align:start position:0%
our major concerns for us of course so
 
02:43:11.830 --> 02:43:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:13.590 --> 02:43:13.600 align:start position:0%
could you answer my same question i'm
 
02:43:14.790 --> 02:43:14.800 align:start position:0%
sorry i didn't hear what your question
 
02:43:14.800 --> 02:43:15.590 align:start position:0%
sorry i didn't hear what your question
was

02:43:15.590 --> 02:43:15.600 align:start position:0%
was
 
02:43:17.750 --> 02:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
if you were to pull someone over and the
 
02:43:19.670 --> 02:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
it's a they give you a bill of sale and
 
02:43:21.429 --> 02:43:21.439 align:start position:0%
they're running their plate that they
 
02:43:22.790 --> 02:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
just took off their other car and
 
02:43:24.309 --> 02:43:24.319 align:start position:0%
they're going home what's the likelihood
 
02:43:25.349 --> 02:43:25.359 align:start position:0%
you're actually giving them a ticket if
 
02:43:27.269 --> 02:43:27.279 align:start position:0%
that's the only issue they're going home
 
02:43:29.990 --> 02:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:32.389 --> 02:43:32.399 align:start position:0%
wow okay um there's probably a pretty
 
02:43:35.110 --> 02:43:35.120 align:start position:0%
good likelihood of that honestly because
 
02:43:37.429 --> 02:43:37.439 align:start position:0%
attaching that plate um you know from
 
02:43:39.349 --> 02:43:39.359 align:start position:0%
that from their vehicle to another car
 
02:43:42.150 --> 02:43:42.160 align:start position:0%
in and of itself is a is a law violation
 
02:43:43.590 --> 02:43:43.600 align:start position:0%
um so now you've got the car that's not
 
02:43:45.590 --> 02:43:45.600 align:start position:0%
registered at all plus they've already
 
02:43:46.950 --> 02:43:46.960 align:start position:0%
swapped over the plate so there's kind
 
02:43:48.710 --> 02:43:48.720 align:start position:0%
of a couple of things going on there so
 
02:43:50.469 --> 02:43:50.479 align:start position:0%
that is a concern again only because we
 
02:43:51.990 --> 02:43:52.000 align:start position:0%
have no way of validating any of the
 
02:43:53.510 --> 02:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
information that's that's transferred
 
02:43:57.190 --> 02:43:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:58.630 --> 02:43:58.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i guess you
 
02:44:00.070 --> 02:44:00.080 align:start position:0%
brought up another issue if i'm
 
02:44:01.830 --> 02:44:01.840 align:start position:0%
purchasing this vehicle and say it's an
 
02:44:04.389 --> 02:44:04.399 align:start position:0%
antique and it's not inspected
 
02:44:06.230 --> 02:44:06.240 align:start position:0%
i would get pulled over for
 
02:44:07.750 --> 02:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
the car being not inspected as well
 
02:44:09.670 --> 02:44:09.680 align:start position:0%
correct if there's no sticker on it
 
02:44:11.429 --> 02:44:11.439 align:start position:0%
correct there is a potential that it
 
02:44:12.630 --> 02:44:12.640 align:start position:0%
would get pulled over for not being
 
02:44:14.070 --> 02:44:14.080 align:start position:0%
inspected because it would have hard you
 
02:44:15.429 --> 02:44:15.439 align:start position:0%
know registration plates on it without
 
02:44:21.910 --> 02:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:27.750 --> 02:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:29.030 --> 02:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
get used to these things one of these
 
02:44:29.040 --> 02:44:30.309 align:start position:0%
get used to these things one of these
days

02:44:30.309 --> 02:44:30.319 align:start position:0%
days
 
02:44:31.910 --> 02:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes jeff overdank from the
 
02:44:33.750 --> 02:44:33.760 align:start position:0%
department of motor vehicles
 
02:44:39.590 --> 02:44:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:41.030 --> 02:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
good afternoon mr chairman and members
 
02:44:43.429 --> 02:44:43.439 align:start position:0%
of the committee uh once again the dmv
 
02:44:45.030 --> 02:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
also opposes this bill for a number of
 
02:44:46.870 --> 02:44:46.880 align:start position:0%
reasons that have been outlined but i
 
02:44:49.349 --> 02:44:49.359 align:start position:0%
think most importantly for us when you
 
02:44:51.349 --> 02:44:51.359 align:start position:0%
receive one of our registrations in one
 
02:44:52.550 --> 02:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
of our plates that there is an
 
02:44:54.309 --> 02:44:54.319 align:start position:0%
expectation that you're going to be
 
02:44:56.790 --> 02:44:56.800 align:start position:0%
successful no matter where you go
 
02:44:58.469 --> 02:44:58.479 align:start position:0%
and this bill certainly undermines that
 
02:44:59.750 --> 02:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
if you're purchasing a vehicle out of
 
02:45:01.269 --> 02:45:01.279 align:start position:0%
state who may not be familiar with our
 
02:45:02.870 --> 02:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
state laws
 
02:45:04.630 --> 02:45:04.640 align:start position:0%
so purchasing that vehicle somewhere
 
02:45:06.550 --> 02:45:06.560 align:start position:0%
else and throwing a different plate on
 
02:45:09.190 --> 02:45:09.200 align:start position:0%
it for lack of a better term and driving
 
02:45:13.030 --> 02:45:13.040 align:start position:0%
away as lieutenant o'leary just spoke of
 
02:45:15.269 --> 02:45:15.279 align:start position:0%
chances are you're not proceeding
 
02:45:16.550 --> 02:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
if you're out of state and they can't
 
02:45:18.150 --> 02:45:18.160 align:start position:0%
determine if that car belongs on that
 
02:45:18.160 --> 02:45:19.670 align:start position:0%
determine if that car belongs on that
plate

02:45:19.670 --> 02:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
plate
 
02:45:21.830 --> 02:45:21.840 align:start position:0%
somebody roadside may think seamlessly
 
02:45:23.349 --> 02:45:23.359 align:start position:0%
well this is because of a car sale and i
 
02:45:24.550 --> 02:45:24.560 align:start position:0%
think if you're in new hampshire you can
 
02:45:25.910 --> 02:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
determine that if it's a new hampshire
 
02:45:27.910 --> 02:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
law but if you're roadside in another
 
02:45:29.349 --> 02:45:29.359 align:start position:0%
state three or four states away
 
02:45:30.950 --> 02:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
purchasing a vehicle they have no idea
 
02:45:32.870 --> 02:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
if you've stolen those plates from
 
02:45:35.349 --> 02:45:35.359 align:start position:0%
somebody else or taking them off another
 
02:45:37.590 --> 02:45:37.600 align:start position:0%
vehicle fraudulently
 
02:45:38.950 --> 02:45:38.960 align:start position:0%
chances are that vehicle is not going to
 
02:45:41.750 --> 02:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
make it back with you to new hampshire
 
02:45:43.990 --> 02:45:44.000 align:start position:0%
in a timely fashion and it also does
 
02:45:45.830 --> 02:45:45.840 align:start position:0%
talk about the inspection program the
 
02:45:47.349 --> 02:45:47.359 align:start position:0%
only way that you get
 
02:45:49.910 --> 02:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
a 20-day plate on a vehicle is if it's
 
02:45:52.950 --> 02:45:52.960 align:start position:0%
inspectable or in is is inspected or if
 
02:45:54.950 --> 02:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
it's in inspectable condition
 
02:45:56.230 --> 02:45:56.240 align:start position:0%
and you're kind of throwing that to the
 
02:45:57.830 --> 02:45:57.840 align:start position:0%
side if you're saying throw a good plate
 
02:45:59.670 --> 02:45:59.680 align:start position:0%
on a car that hasn't been inspected or
 
02:46:01.670 --> 02:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
that you don't know is in inspectable
 
02:46:01.680 --> 02:46:03.830 align:start position:0%
that you don't know is in inspectable
condition

02:46:03.830 --> 02:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
condition
 
02:46:05.429 --> 02:46:05.439 align:start position:0%
with that i'll take any questions you
 
02:46:06.870 --> 02:46:06.880 align:start position:0%
may have thank you
 
02:46:08.389 --> 02:46:08.399 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
02:46:08.399 --> 02:46:10.070 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
representative

02:46:10.070 --> 02:46:10.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:46:11.349 --> 02:46:11.359 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
02:46:13.349 --> 02:46:13.359 align:start position:0%
question um it seems there are some
 
02:46:15.269 --> 02:46:15.279 align:start position:0%
deficiencies in the bill but
 
02:46:16.630 --> 02:46:16.640 align:start position:0%
is there anything here that would
 
02:46:19.110 --> 02:46:19.120 align:start position:0%
prevent someone from
 
02:46:21.110 --> 02:46:21.120 align:start position:0%
taking their plate off of their car at
 
02:46:23.030 --> 02:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
home driving it for the five days and
 
02:46:23.040 --> 02:46:24.710 align:start position:0%
home driving it for the five days and
then

02:46:24.710 --> 02:46:24.720 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:46:26.070 --> 02:46:26.080 align:start position:0%
just keep it on
 
02:46:28.230 --> 02:46:28.240 align:start position:0%
and keep going there's no
 
02:46:29.269 --> 02:46:29.279 align:start position:0%
there's no
 
02:46:31.590 --> 02:46:31.600 align:start position:0%
clear penalty with the penalty if caught
 
02:46:33.349 --> 02:46:33.359 align:start position:0%
then fall under the driving uh
 
02:46:35.830 --> 02:46:35.840 align:start position:0%
unregistered car or misuse of plates
 
02:46:37.590 --> 02:46:37.600 align:start position:0%
sure if you have good driving habits
 
02:46:40.230 --> 02:46:40.240 align:start position:0%
chances are nobody's going to know yeah
 
02:46:41.990 --> 02:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
right and then and again there there
 
02:46:44.150 --> 02:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
goes that revenue that again the point
 
02:46:45.429 --> 02:46:45.439 align:start position:0%
of the registration is putting that
 
02:46:46.790 --> 02:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
money back into the infrastructure in
 
02:46:48.309 --> 02:46:48.319 align:start position:0%
which you're traveling on and if you're
 
02:46:50.870 --> 02:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
doing it for 20 30 100 days
 
02:46:52.550 --> 02:46:52.560 align:start position:0%
you're not paying that registration fee
 
02:46:54.389 --> 02:46:54.399 align:start position:0%
that belongs to the road use for that
 
02:46:54.399 --> 02:46:56.630 align:start position:0%
that belongs to the road use for that
car

02:46:56.630 --> 02:46:56.640 align:start position:0%
car
 
02:46:58.150 --> 02:46:58.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:46:59.910 --> 02:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
representative gorski
 
02:47:01.429 --> 02:47:01.439 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
02:47:03.510 --> 02:47:03.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:47:04.870 --> 02:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
if i
 
02:47:07.110 --> 02:47:07.120 align:start position:0%
let's say i go down to massachusetts to
 
02:47:09.030 --> 02:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
buy a vehicle from somebody can you
 
02:47:10.550 --> 02:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
explain kind of the
 
02:47:12.469 --> 02:47:12.479 align:start position:0%
the process
 
02:47:14.950 --> 02:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
that i should be going through
 
02:47:16.150 --> 02:47:16.160 align:start position:0%
in order to
 
02:47:17.910 --> 02:47:17.920 align:start position:0%
you know get that registered before i
 
02:47:20.309 --> 02:47:20.319 align:start position:0%
drive away with that vehicle from a
 
02:47:20.319 --> 02:47:21.750 align:start position:0%
drive away with that vehicle from a
person

02:47:21.750 --> 02:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
person
 
02:47:23.670 --> 02:47:23.680 align:start position:0%
well i certainly i can't answer what
 
02:47:25.190 --> 02:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
other states would do and whether or not
 
02:47:27.110 --> 02:47:27.120 align:start position:0%
they're going to give you a temporary
 
02:47:29.429 --> 02:47:29.439 align:start position:0%
tag to get the vehicle home i know that
 
02:47:31.110 --> 02:47:31.120 align:start position:0%
most do
 
02:47:33.429 --> 02:47:33.439 align:start position:0%
actually we have somebody from nhada
 
02:47:35.670 --> 02:47:35.680 align:start position:0%
that may be able to answer that question
 
02:47:37.990 --> 02:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
uh but having said that
 
02:47:39.670 --> 02:47:39.680 align:start position:0%
we would issue a 20-day plate to any
 
02:47:41.269 --> 02:47:41.279 align:start position:0%
vehicle that's road-worthy and allow
 
02:47:43.110 --> 02:47:43.120 align:start position:0%
them to continue on their way
 
02:47:43.120 --> 02:47:43.910 align:start position:0%
them to continue on their way
and

02:47:43.910 --> 02:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:47:45.349 --> 02:47:45.359 align:start position:0%
one would assume that if you're if
 
02:47:46.790 --> 02:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
you're buying a vehicle at a dealership
 
02:47:48.070 --> 02:47:48.080 align:start position:0%
that you'd be doing the same and getting
 
02:47:50.070 --> 02:47:50.080 align:start position:0%
the same treatment
 
02:47:52.469 --> 02:47:52.479 align:start position:0%
follow-up yep follow-up if if i'm buying
 
02:47:54.710 --> 02:47:54.720 align:start position:0%
it from a person sure
 
02:47:57.590 --> 02:47:57.600 align:start position:0%
do i do i have to like go and get
 
02:48:00.070 --> 02:48:00.080 align:start position:0%
temporary plates before
 
02:48:02.550 --> 02:48:02.560 align:start position:0%
i'm able to drive away with that is that
 
02:48:04.070 --> 02:48:04.080 align:start position:0%
kind of the process absolutely
 
02:48:05.349 --> 02:48:05.359 align:start position:0%
everything's got to be registered before
 
02:48:08.469 --> 02:48:08.479 align:start position:0%
it goes on the road okay thank you
 
02:48:10.790 --> 02:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
further questions representative fenton
 
02:48:12.630 --> 02:48:12.640 align:start position:0%
um i sympathize with this because i have
 
02:48:14.790 --> 02:48:14.800 align:start position:0%
purchased cars off craigslist and it can
 
02:48:16.630 --> 02:48:16.640 align:start position:0%
be kind of cumbersome running to the dmv
 
02:48:19.510 --> 02:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
and getting a red plate and all that
 
02:48:22.230 --> 02:48:22.240 align:start position:0%
would you be open to a program where
 
02:48:24.150 --> 02:48:24.160 align:start position:0%
maybe you apply an advance with a vin
 
02:48:25.590 --> 02:48:25.600 align:start position:0%
number in the car and show that it's
 
02:48:27.110 --> 02:48:27.120 align:start position:0%
inspected and you could go down there
 
02:48:29.110 --> 02:48:29.120 align:start position:0%
and put a temporary plate on it you
 
02:48:30.630 --> 02:48:30.640 align:start position:0%
issue a template assigned to that car
 
02:48:31.990 --> 02:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
would that be some sort of program
 
02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:33.429 align:start position:0%
would that be some sort of program
that's

02:48:33.429 --> 02:48:33.439 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:48:35.190 --> 02:48:35.200 align:start position:0%
possible yeah we'd be interested in
 
02:48:37.190 --> 02:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
hearing the the thought process on that
 
02:48:37.200 --> 02:48:38.150 align:start position:0%
hearing the the thought process on that
and

02:48:38.150 --> 02:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:48:39.670 --> 02:48:39.680 align:start position:0%
and what could work because we certainly
 
02:48:41.750 --> 02:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
have a 20-day plate program
 
02:48:43.830 --> 02:48:43.840 align:start position:0%
that works very well and as you know
 
02:48:46.550 --> 02:48:46.560 align:start position:0%
works very well monday through friday
 
02:48:49.910 --> 02:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
it's just those off-hour purchases right
 
02:48:51.830 --> 02:48:51.840 align:start position:0%
fair enough any other questions from the
 
02:48:51.840 --> 02:48:53.750 align:start position:0%

and

04:02:52.670 --> 04:02:52.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:02:55.269 --> 04:02:55.279 align:start position:0%
i believe that is all
 
04:02:57.910 --> 04:02:57.920 align:start position:0%
in my bill here 1158 relative to use the
 
04:03:01.590 --> 04:03:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:03.510 --> 04:03:03.520 align:start position:0%
the reason i brought this forth is i had
 
04:03:06.389 --> 04:03:06.399 align:start position:0%
a friend of mine that always left his on
 
04:03:07.670 --> 04:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
the mirror
 
04:03:10.710 --> 04:03:10.720 align:start position:0%
and one day he was crossing a side road
 
04:03:12.550 --> 04:03:12.560 align:start position:0%
on 111
 
04:03:12.560 --> 04:03:13.429 align:start position:0%
on 111
and

04:03:13.429 --> 04:03:13.439 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:03:15.910 --> 04:03:15.920 align:start position:0%
he got broadsided
 
04:03:19.030 --> 04:03:19.040 align:start position:0%
a vehicle on 111 was going west and he
 
04:03:20.790 --> 04:03:20.800 align:start position:0%
didn't see it
 
04:03:22.309 --> 04:03:22.319 align:start position:0%
the other time was
 
04:03:24.710 --> 04:03:24.720 align:start position:0%
i was up at cmc
 
04:03:26.630 --> 04:03:26.640 align:start position:0%
and i was looking for a handicap spot
 
04:03:29.429 --> 04:03:29.439 align:start position:0%
because i had to go into the hospital
 
04:03:31.269 --> 04:03:31.279 align:start position:0%
and i couldn't find one so i had to park
 
04:03:32.550 --> 04:03:32.560 align:start position:0%
down the street
 
04:03:32.560 --> 04:03:33.510 align:start position:0%
down the street
and

04:03:33.510 --> 04:03:33.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:03:35.030 --> 04:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
as i was coming into the hospital
 
04:03:37.110 --> 04:03:37.120 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
04:03:39.510 --> 04:03:39.520 align:start position:0%
hospital police officer
 
04:03:41.189 --> 04:03:41.199 align:start position:0%
and i asked him if he'd mind checking
 
04:03:44.229 --> 04:03:44.239 align:start position:0%
the plaques on the cars that were there
 
04:03:46.229 --> 04:03:46.239 align:start position:0%
and he did and he got back to me and he
 
04:03:49.750 --> 04:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
says yeah there was one that was expired
 
04:03:49.760 --> 04:03:50.790 align:start position:0%
says yeah there was one that was expired
and

04:03:50.790 --> 04:03:50.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:03:53.269 --> 04:03:53.279 align:start position:0%
i have a friend i had a friend he passed
 
04:03:54.790 --> 04:03:54.800 align:start position:0%
away also
 
04:03:54.800 --> 04:03:55.590 align:start position:0%
away also
that

04:03:55.590 --> 04:03:55.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:03:57.830 --> 04:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
was riding around with the
 
04:04:00.469 --> 04:04:00.479 align:start position:0%
expired card
 
04:04:02.469 --> 04:04:02.479 align:start position:0%
and when i had my
 
04:04:02.479 --> 04:04:03.269 align:start position:0%
and when i had my
gas

04:04:03.269 --> 04:04:03.279 align:start position:0%
gas
 
04:04:05.429 --> 04:04:05.439 align:start position:0%
not gas station but repair shop i
 
04:04:07.110 --> 04:04:07.120 align:start position:0%
wouldn't do a sticker if a person came
 
04:04:09.030 --> 04:04:09.040 align:start position:0%
in and left it on the mirror because it
 
04:04:11.269 --> 04:04:11.279 align:start position:0%
says right on the cards right at the top
 
04:04:14.630 --> 04:04:14.640 align:start position:0%
please remove before driving
 
04:04:16.630 --> 04:04:16.640 align:start position:0%
and i see so many vehicles riding around
 
04:04:19.349 --> 04:04:19.359 align:start position:0%
them left on the windshield
 
04:04:19.359 --> 04:04:21.269 align:start position:0%
them left on the windshield
and

04:04:21.269 --> 04:04:21.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:04:22.950 --> 04:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
if you've taken a few moments and gone
 
04:04:25.030 --> 04:04:25.040 align:start position:0%
to some places like walmart lowe's or
 
04:04:26.550 --> 04:04:26.560 align:start position:0%
home depot
 
04:04:28.550 --> 04:04:28.560 align:start position:0%
you'll see people coming in and park
 
04:04:31.189 --> 04:04:31.199 align:start position:0%
their car and get out and you'll say
 
04:04:33.670 --> 04:04:33.680 align:start position:0%
why have they got a card they're walking
 
04:04:36.070 --> 04:04:36.080 align:start position:0%
with no problems whatsoever
 
04:04:38.309 --> 04:04:38.319 align:start position:0%
and they're young
 
04:04:40.630 --> 04:04:40.640 align:start position:0%
so i don't know i didn't go
 
04:04:42.630 --> 04:04:42.640 align:start position:0%
question them but
 
04:04:44.469 --> 04:04:44.479 align:start position:0%
this just seems like there's an abuse to
 
04:04:46.550 --> 04:04:46.560 align:start position:0%
these cards if you don't want to remove
 
04:04:47.990 --> 04:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
it from the windshield then get the
 
04:04:50.469 --> 04:04:50.479 align:start position:0%
handicapped plate
 
04:04:54.469 --> 04:04:54.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:56.150 --> 04:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
any questions for this
 
04:04:58.229 --> 04:04:58.239 align:start position:0%
go ahead representative
 
04:04:59.750 --> 04:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
04:05:01.590 --> 04:05:01.600 align:start position:0%
question you're welcome
 
04:05:04.150 --> 04:05:04.160 align:start position:0%

um

04:05:05.590 --> 04:05:05.600 align:start position:0%

trying to make here
um

04:05:11.110 --> 04:05:11.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:05:13.750 --> 04:05:13.760 align:start position:0%

broadside yes um i don't understand what
 
04:05:19.910 --> 04:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
the placard had to do with that
 
04:05:22.070 --> 04:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
he didn't see the car why blocking his
 
04:05:22.080 --> 04:05:23.030 align:start position:0%
he didn't see the car why blocking his
vision

04:05:23.030 --> 04:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
vision
 
04:05:24.550 --> 04:05:24.560 align:start position:0%
the hanging card was blocking his vision
 
04:05:26.950 --> 04:05:26.960 align:start position:0%
okay thank sorry i'm sorry mr chairman
 
04:05:28.790 --> 04:05:28.800 align:start position:0%
may i just sure
 
04:05:31.269 --> 04:05:31.279 align:start position:0%
i'm looking for the intent of this
 
04:05:31.279 --> 04:05:33.670 align:start position:0%
i'm looking for the intent of this
so

04:05:33.670 --> 04:05:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:36.469 --> 04:05:36.479 align:start position:0%
you're adding in verbage that says
 
04:05:38.870 --> 04:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
a removable windshield placard
 
04:05:41.269 --> 04:05:41.279 align:start position:0%
shall not be displayed
 
04:05:44.710 --> 04:05:44.720 align:start position:0%
okay so your intent is that they remove
 
04:05:47.590 --> 04:05:47.600 align:start position:0%
it while driving it's the law it is the
 
04:05:49.990 --> 04:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
law so i guess i'm wondering
 
04:05:52.389 --> 04:05:52.399 align:start position:0%
why you're needing to put it in here
 
04:05:54.950 --> 04:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
well i'd feel it as being totally abused
 
04:05:54.960 --> 04:05:55.910 align:start position:0%
well i'd feel it as being totally abused
and

04:05:55.910 --> 04:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:06:00.229 --> 04:06:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:01.750 --> 04:06:01.760 align:start position:0%
and the other thing is
 
04:06:03.910 --> 04:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
i didn't read to the point that i wish i
 
04:06:07.110 --> 04:06:07.120 align:start position:0%
had time to go down to
 
04:06:09.750 --> 04:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
legislative help there and change it
 
04:06:11.510 --> 04:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
on a third offense
 
04:06:16.070 --> 04:06:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:18.229 --> 04:06:18.239 align:start position:0%
for 90 days
 
04:06:20.309 --> 04:06:20.319 align:start position:0%
i would rather see them do a 10 mile
 
04:06:24.309 --> 04:06:24.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:26.710 --> 04:06:26.720 align:start position:0%
follow it please sure
 
04:06:26.720 --> 04:06:28.550 align:start position:0%
follow it please sure
um

04:06:28.550 --> 04:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:06:31.110 --> 04:06:31.120 align:start position:0%
i guess i the fact that you didn't point
 
04:06:34.630 --> 04:06:34.640 align:start position:0%
out that this is adding uh um
 
04:06:34.640 --> 04:06:35.510 align:start position:0%
out that this is adding uh um
the

04:06:35.510 --> 04:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:06:37.269 --> 04:06:37.279 align:start position:0%
fines in here or
 
04:06:39.590 --> 04:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
you're modifying it i guess i'm having
 
04:06:41.510 --> 04:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
trouble understanding
 
04:06:41.520 --> 04:06:43.750 align:start position:0%
trouble understanding
um

04:06:43.750 --> 04:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:06:45.590 --> 04:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
there's a part in here and maybe someone
 
04:06:46.950 --> 04:06:46.960 align:start position:0%
we i discussed it with a couple
 
04:06:46.960 --> 04:06:48.630 align:start position:0%
we i discussed it with a couple
colleagues

04:06:48.630 --> 04:06:48.640 align:start position:0%
colleagues
 
04:06:51.189 --> 04:06:51.199 align:start position:0%
it's talking about if you don't use it
 
04:06:52.469 --> 04:06:52.479 align:start position:0%
in a vehicle
 
04:06:55.670 --> 04:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
that's registered to you is there a part
 
04:06:57.510 --> 04:06:57.520 align:start position:0%
about that
 
04:06:57.520 --> 04:06:58.389 align:start position:0%
about that
yes

04:06:58.389 --> 04:06:58.399 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:07:01.269 --> 04:07:01.279 align:start position:0%
i guess my question is what about the
 
04:07:03.590 --> 04:07:03.600 align:start position:0%
disabled person who does not drive or a
 
04:07:06.229 --> 04:07:06.239 align:start position:0%
blind person who does not drive how can
 
04:07:08.550 --> 04:07:08.560 align:start position:0%
they then have a placard registered to a
 
04:07:10.309 --> 04:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
vehicle if they don't have a vehicle
 
04:07:11.750 --> 04:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
because they can't drive when you go to
 
04:07:13.590 --> 04:07:13.600 align:start position:0%
motor vehicles i believe when you apply
 
04:07:14.630 --> 04:07:14.640 align:start position:0%
for that
 
04:07:16.389 --> 04:07:16.399 align:start position:0%
they you have to put down a registration
 
04:07:16.399 --> 04:07:18.150 align:start position:0%
they you have to put down a registration
number

04:07:18.150 --> 04:07:18.160 align:start position:0%
number
 
04:07:21.030 --> 04:07:21.040 align:start position:0%
because i i have two plaques
 
04:07:23.110 --> 04:07:23.120 align:start position:0%
and i had to put down the registration
 
04:07:23.120 --> 04:07:25.110 align:start position:0%
and i had to put down the registration
numbers

04:07:25.110 --> 04:07:25.120 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
04:07:25.120 --> 04:07:26.150 align:start position:0%
numbers
follow-up

04:07:26.150 --> 04:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
04:07:28.469 --> 04:07:28.479 align:start position:0%
yeah i'll give you one more one more
 
04:07:30.150 --> 04:07:30.160 align:start position:0%
so if you have someone who's getting a
 
04:07:31.429 --> 04:07:31.439 align:start position:0%
ride from someone to a doctor's
 
04:07:32.950 --> 04:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
appointment they're not allowed to take
 
04:07:34.229 --> 04:07:34.239 align:start position:0%
their placard
 
04:07:36.149 --> 04:07:36.159 align:start position:0%
and go into their neighbor's car to get
 
04:07:38.149 --> 04:07:38.159 align:start position:0%
a ride to the hospital for a i don't
 
04:07:41.670 --> 04:07:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:45.030 --> 04:07:45.040 align:start position:0%
i don't think that should be uh
 
04:07:47.349 --> 04:07:47.359 align:start position:0%
uh find i mean if you see someone that's
 
04:07:50.790 --> 04:07:50.800 align:start position:0%
at a hospital or doctor's appointment
 
04:07:55.269 --> 04:07:55.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:57.429 --> 04:07:57.439 align:start position:0%
it's those that abuse it that
 
04:08:00.309 --> 04:08:00.319 align:start position:0%
maybe uh someone says oh i got an extra
 
04:08:02.710 --> 04:08:02.720 align:start position:0%
one here put it on your car and you use
 
04:08:05.830 --> 04:08:05.840 align:start position:0%
it and you use it all the time
 
04:08:08.309 --> 04:08:08.319 align:start position:0%
i'll let it go to other people thank you
 
04:08:08.319 --> 04:08:09.830 align:start position:0%
i'll let it go to other people thank you
yeah

04:08:09.830 --> 04:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:08:12.149 --> 04:08:12.159 align:start position:0%
representative green yes
 
04:08:14.389 --> 04:08:14.399 align:start position:0%
all these things that you have
 
04:08:15.750 --> 04:08:15.760 align:start position:0%
in this bill
 
04:08:19.110 --> 04:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
are they not already under law yes
 
04:08:19.120 --> 04:08:19.990 align:start position:0%
are they not already under law yes
so

04:08:19.990 --> 04:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:08:23.429 --> 04:08:23.439 align:start position:0%
my question is why do we need this bill
 
04:08:26.870 --> 04:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
because the abuse of the plaques
 
04:08:26.880 --> 04:08:28.070 align:start position:0%
because the abuse of the plaques
well

04:08:28.070 --> 04:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:08:30.309 --> 04:08:30.319 align:start position:0%
this bill won't change anything
 
04:08:31.830 --> 04:08:31.840 align:start position:0%
they'll still abuse it if they want to
 
04:08:34.389 --> 04:08:34.399 align:start position:0%
abuse it am i right
 
04:08:37.349 --> 04:08:37.359 align:start position:0%
uh not with the fine up as high as i put
 
04:08:37.359 --> 04:08:39.110 align:start position:0%
uh not with the fine up as high as i put
it

04:08:39.110 --> 04:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:08:39.120 --> 04:08:40.469 align:start position:0%
it
well

04:08:40.469 --> 04:08:40.479 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:08:42.870 --> 04:08:42.880 align:start position:0%
with all due respect the fines gonna be
 
04:08:45.830 --> 04:08:45.840 align:start position:0%
kind of these people are on are these
 
04:08:47.670 --> 04:08:47.680 align:start position:0%
placards temporary or are they going to
 
04:08:49.670 --> 04:08:49.680 align:start position:0%
be permanent
 
04:08:53.349 --> 04:08:53.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:56.070 --> 04:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
i believe it's every five years
 
04:08:58.149 --> 04:08:58.159 align:start position:0%
you have to renew it yeah i know with my
 
04:08:59.910 --> 04:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
back surgery my knee surgeries i had
 
04:09:01.670 --> 04:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
temporary placards which lasted about
 
04:09:02.950 --> 04:09:02.960 align:start position:0%
six months
 
04:09:02.960 --> 04:09:03.990 align:start position:0%
six months
okay

04:09:03.990 --> 04:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:09:07.349 --> 04:09:07.359 align:start position:0%
but in those six months
 
04:09:09.830 --> 04:09:09.840 align:start position:0%
i could have abused it any time i wanted
 
04:09:11.990 --> 04:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
to i mean law enforcement takes care of
 
04:09:15.990 --> 04:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
it i know for a fact that if a placard
 
04:09:18.550 --> 04:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
somebody is parked in a handicapped
 
04:09:21.349 --> 04:09:21.359 align:start position:0%
plate with a temporary placard on and
 
04:09:22.790 --> 04:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
it's expired
 
04:09:24.550 --> 04:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
if somebody checks it out even in the
 
04:09:27.349 --> 04:09:27.359 align:start position:0%
store the store can call up the towing
 
04:09:29.670 --> 04:09:29.680 align:start position:0%
company or police and have that thing
 
04:09:31.670 --> 04:09:31.680 align:start position:0%
towed out of there never seen it happen
 
04:09:33.189 --> 04:09:33.199 align:start position:0%
but that's true
 
04:09:33.199 --> 04:09:34.790 align:start position:0%
but that's true
well

04:09:34.790 --> 04:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:09:36.630 --> 04:09:36.640 align:start position:0%
i have
 
04:09:36.640 --> 04:09:37.750 align:start position:0%
i have
okay

04:09:37.750 --> 04:09:37.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:09:40.550 --> 04:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:42.229 --> 04:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
seeing no weather questions thank you
 
04:09:48.710 --> 04:09:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:56.070 --> 04:09:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:57.269 --> 04:09:57.279 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman members of the
 
04:09:59.269 --> 04:09:59.279 align:start position:0%
committee again
 
04:09:59.279 --> 04:10:00.389 align:start position:0%
committee again
uh

04:10:00.389 --> 04:10:00.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:10:02.630 --> 04:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
we certainly support representative
 
04:10:04.469 --> 04:10:04.479 align:start position:0%
green in this intent in what he's trying
 
04:10:07.590 --> 04:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
to do here we also see an abuse of these
 
04:10:10.229 --> 04:10:10.239 align:start position:0%
types of situations but i just wanted to
 
04:10:12.469 --> 04:10:12.479 align:start position:0%
offer maybe a point of clarification we
 
04:10:15.429 --> 04:10:15.439 align:start position:0%
do have a law in the book right now rsa
 
04:10:19.590 --> 04:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
265 95 subsection 3 that does speak to
 
04:10:21.670 --> 04:10:21.680 align:start position:0%
obstruction of driver's view
 
04:10:23.349 --> 04:10:23.359 align:start position:0%
and if an officer does see one of these
 
04:10:25.510 --> 04:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
hanging plaque cards on a motor vehicle
 
04:10:27.269 --> 04:10:27.279 align:start position:0%
while in operation he can make a motor
 
04:10:28.630 --> 04:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
vehicle stop and find the driver for
 
04:10:31.349 --> 04:10:31.359 align:start position:0%
having that item in its view so as you
 
04:10:33.510 --> 04:10:33.520 align:start position:0%
alluded to earlier we do already have
 
04:10:35.670 --> 04:10:35.680 align:start position:0%
that law in place
 
04:10:37.189 --> 04:10:37.199 align:start position:0%
as far as the fines you know that's a
 
04:10:38.950 --> 04:10:38.960 align:start position:0%
whole separate object but we also we
 
04:10:40.630 --> 04:10:40.640 align:start position:0%
also support representative green in
 
04:10:42.630 --> 04:10:42.640 align:start position:0%
that intent but i believe that that law
 
04:10:44.229 --> 04:10:44.239 align:start position:0%
is already on the books
 
04:10:45.510 --> 04:10:45.520 align:start position:0%
to answer your question ma'am from
 
04:10:45.520 --> 04:10:46.950 align:start position:0%
to answer your question ma'am from
earlier

04:10:46.950 --> 04:10:46.960 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
04:10:48.790 --> 04:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
the intent behind the hanging plaque
 
04:10:50.950 --> 04:10:50.960 align:start position:0%
card is exactly what you had said you
 
04:10:53.110 --> 04:10:53.120 align:start position:0%
can move from one vehicle to the next if
 
04:10:55.110 --> 04:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
you're a permanent if you are somebody
 
04:10:56.870 --> 04:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
with a disability you can opt to have
 
04:10:58.630 --> 04:10:58.640 align:start position:0%
license plates that are attached to your
 
04:11:00.309 --> 04:11:00.319 align:start position:0%
vehicle so it's there all the time but
 
04:11:01.590 --> 04:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
the intent behind that hanging plat
 
04:11:03.349 --> 04:11:03.359 align:start position:0%
guard is so that you can bring it from
 
04:11:06.309 --> 04:11:06.319 align:start position:0%
one vehicle to another so i'm willing to

disability placards
 
04:33:40.390 --> 04:33:40.400 align:start position:0%
the issue this bill addresses first came
 
04:33:42.470 --> 04:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
to my attention back in 2020 in the form
 
04:33:45.109 --> 04:33:45.119 align:start position:0%
of house bill 1547
 
04:33:47.029 --> 04:33:47.039 align:start position:0%
when then chairman sykes submitted the
 
04:33:49.349 --> 04:33:49.359 align:start position:0%
bill at the request of the dmv it came
 
04:33:51.349 --> 04:33:51.359 align:start position:0%
out of this committee ought to pass and
 
04:33:53.269 --> 04:33:53.279 align:start position:0%
passed the full house on a voice vote in
 
04:33:54.949 --> 04:33:54.959 align:start position:0%
the middle of the night on that infamous
 
04:33:56.830 --> 04:33:56.840 align:start position:0%
day march 13
 
04:33:59.830 --> 04:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
2020. from there it was lost to covid in
 
04:34:02.789 --> 04:34:02.799 align:start position:0%
the senate where it died on the table
 
04:34:04.789 --> 04:34:04.799 align:start position:0%
several months ago i had a conversation
 
04:34:07.670 --> 04:34:07.680 align:start position:0%
with then director bilecki about dmv
 
04:34:09.510 --> 04:34:09.520 align:start position:0%
requested bills that were lost to covid
 
04:34:11.349 --> 04:34:11.359 align:start position:0%
and she asked if i could file this bill
 
04:34:11.359 --> 04:34:12.709 align:start position:0%
and she asked if i could file this bill
again

04:34:12.709 --> 04:34:12.719 align:start position:0%
again
 
04:34:15.029 --> 04:34:15.039 align:start position:0%
what this bill does is remove from the
 
04:34:16.709 --> 04:34:16.719 align:start position:0%
statute on walking disability and
 
04:34:19.109 --> 04:34:19.119 align:start position:0%
parking placards verbiage that we
 
04:34:21.269 --> 04:34:21.279 align:start position:0%
actually just discussed at our previous
 
04:34:21.279 --> 04:34:22.789 align:start position:0%
actually just discussed at our previous
bill

04:34:22.789 --> 04:34:22.799 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:34:25.029 --> 04:34:25.039 align:start position:0%
that payment of a five dollar fee must
 
04:34:27.029 --> 04:34:27.039 align:start position:0%
be paid to cover the cost for printing
 
04:34:28.789 --> 04:34:28.799 align:start position:0%
and mailing
 
04:34:30.709 --> 04:34:30.719 align:start position:0%
these are those hanging placards that
 
04:34:32.709 --> 04:34:32.719 align:start position:0%
someone gets for a temporary injury or
 
04:34:34.551 --> 04:34:34.561 align:start position:0%
surgery or permanent placard if they
 
04:34:36.310 --> 04:34:36.320 align:start position:0%
have a disability
 
04:34:37.830 --> 04:34:37.840 align:start position:0%
i direct your attention to the fiscal
 
04:34:40.470 --> 04:34:40.480 align:start position:0%
note on this bill which reads currently
 
04:34:43.029 --> 04:34:43.039 align:start position:0%
dmv does not charge this fee
 
04:34:45.750 --> 04:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
as it operates under guidance since it
 
04:34:47.349 --> 04:34:47.359 align:start position:0%
is needed under the americans with
 
04:34:49.670 --> 04:34:49.680 align:start position:0%
disabilities act therefore this bill
 
04:34:52.470 --> 04:34:52.480 align:start position:0%
will result in no new fiscal impact
 
04:34:54.390 --> 04:34:54.400 align:start position:0%
as it would align statute with our
 
04:34:56.150 --> 04:34:56.160 align:start position:0%
current practice
 
04:34:57.750 --> 04:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
in layman's terms
 
04:34:59.990 --> 04:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
charging a fee for a placard is a
 
04:35:01.349 --> 04:35:01.359 align:start position:0%
violation of the americans with
 
04:35:03.990 --> 04:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
disabilities act and the state has not
 
04:35:06.789 --> 04:35:06.799 align:start position:0%
been charging the fee for the placard
 
04:35:08.551 --> 04:35:08.561 align:start position:0%
for several years
 
04:35:10.709 --> 04:35:10.719 align:start position:0%
it is my hope and that of the dmv that
 
04:35:12.150 --> 04:35:12.160 align:start position:0%
this section can be amended to
 
04:35:14.230 --> 04:35:14.240 align:start position:0%
permanently reflect reflect current
 
04:35:16.551 --> 04:35:16.561 align:start position:0%
practice of the department
 
04:35:19.830 --> 04:35:19.840 align:start position:0%
passage of hb 1214 fn would simply clean
 
04:35:22.070 --> 04:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
up the statute with no fiscal impact
 
04:35:24.470 --> 04:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
whatsoever and i consider it simply a
 
04:35:26.551 --> 04:35:26.561 align:start position:0%
housekeeping bill and with that i'd be
 
04:35:28.709 --> 04:35:28.719 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any of your questions
 
04:35:29.590 --> 04:35:29.600 align:start position:0%

this
 
05:03:22.470 --> 05:03:22.480 align:start position:0%
past fall i had the fortune of attending
 
05:03:24.708 --> 05:03:24.718 align:start position:0%
the deerfield fair
 
05:03:24.718 --> 05:03:26.070 align:start position:0%
the deerfield fair
and

05:03:26.070 --> 05:03:26.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:03:26.080 --> 05:03:28.230 align:start position:0%
and
was

05:03:28.230 --> 05:03:28.240 align:start position:0%
was
 
05:03:30.470 --> 05:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
outed as a legislator
 
05:03:32.150 --> 05:03:32.160 align:start position:0%
and what that did is when i went to talk
 
05:03:33.830 --> 05:03:33.840 align:start position:0%
to the east coast tractor folks just to
 
05:03:36.470 --> 05:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
see their display i was inundated by
 
05:03:37.910 --> 05:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
these guys
 
05:03:41.670 --> 05:03:41.680 align:start position:0%
over a multitude of problems that they
 
05:03:43.190 --> 05:03:43.200 align:start position:0%
were dealing with so i spent some time
 
05:03:43.200 --> 05:03:44.070 align:start position:0%
were dealing with so i spent some time
in

05:03:44.070 --> 05:03:44.080 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:03:45.350 --> 05:03:45.360 align:start position:0%
kind of listen to what they had to say
 
05:03:47.190 --> 05:03:47.200 align:start position:0%
and then i
 
05:03:48.948 --> 05:03:48.958 align:start position:0%
i actually was invited to a meeting of
 
05:03:50.868 --> 05:03:50.878 align:start position:0%
the east coast antique tractor club and
 
05:03:53.430 --> 05:03:53.440 align:start position:0%
went over to kensington and sat down
 
05:03:54.948 --> 05:03:54.958 align:start position:0%
with them
 
05:03:56.788 --> 05:03:56.798 align:start position:0%
and i listened
 
05:03:59.270 --> 05:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
and what i heard was was a was an
 
05:04:01.830 --> 05:04:01.840 align:start position:0%
interesting problem
 
05:04:04.628 --> 05:04:04.638 align:start position:0%
i had questions and concerns from those
 
05:04:06.948 --> 05:04:06.958 align:start position:0%
folks about
 
05:04:09.430 --> 05:04:09.440 align:start position:0%
various towns and parades on public
 
05:04:11.350 --> 05:04:11.360 align:start position:0%
streets with their antiques they had
 
05:04:13.270 --> 05:04:13.280 align:start position:0%
questions in reference
 
05:04:13.280 --> 05:04:15.990 align:start position:0%
questions in reference
to

05:04:15.990 --> 05:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:17.430 --> 05:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
whether or not you know they should even
 
05:04:19.670 --> 05:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
register or not register or display and
 
05:04:21.030 --> 05:04:21.040 align:start position:0%
i certainly wasn't going to tell them to
 
05:04:21.040 --> 05:04:22.150 align:start position:0%
i certainly wasn't going to tell them to
violate

05:04:22.150 --> 05:04:22.160 align:start position:0%
violate
 
05:04:24.310 --> 05:04:24.320 align:start position:0%
the law but the biggest thing that came
 
05:04:25.270 --> 05:04:25.280 align:start position:0%
to me
 
05:04:25.280 --> 05:04:26.230 align:start position:0%
to me
was

05:04:26.230 --> 05:04:26.240 align:start position:0%
was
 
05:04:28.230 --> 05:04:28.240 align:start position:0%
and it was a very common problem was the
 
05:04:31.430 --> 05:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
fact that town clerks have a very
 
05:04:33.430 --> 05:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
difficult time
 
05:04:33.440 --> 05:04:35.270 align:start position:0%
difficult time
understanding

05:04:35.270 --> 05:04:35.280 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
05:04:37.590 --> 05:04:37.600 align:start position:0%
antique farm tractors
 
05:04:39.990 --> 05:04:40.000 align:start position:0%
a gentleman from salem indicated to me
 
05:04:41.750 --> 05:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
that the town clerk forced him to
 
05:04:43.670 --> 05:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
register his
 
05:04:45.910 --> 05:04:45.920 align:start position:0%
75 year old tractor is a piece of
 
05:04:48.230 --> 05:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
industrial machinery construction
 
05:04:48.240 --> 05:04:50.310 align:start position:0%
industrial machinery construction
equipment

05:04:50.310 --> 05:04:50.320 align:start position:0%
equipment
 
05:04:52.150 --> 05:04:52.160 align:start position:0%
one clerk insisted because it was a
 
05:04:54.550 --> 05:04:54.560 align:start position:0%
tractor she made the guy register it as
 
05:04:56.948 --> 05:04:56.958 align:start position:0%
what we would consider a semi an 18
 
05:04:58.390 --> 05:04:58.400 align:start position:0%
wheeler which is so
 
05:05:00.708 --> 05:05:00.718 align:start position:0%
so far from reality it's not even funny
 
05:05:00.718 --> 05:05:01.670 align:start position:0%
so far from reality it's not even funny
but

05:05:01.670 --> 05:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:05:03.830 --> 05:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
that common problem of a huge
 
05:05:06.948 --> 05:05:06.958 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding of what these were
 
05:05:08.628 --> 05:05:08.638 align:start position:0%
you know really led me to kind of dig a
 
05:05:11.190 --> 05:05:11.200 align:start position:0%
little bit and in talking
 
05:05:13.430 --> 05:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
with with a particular constituent in
 
05:05:14.868 --> 05:05:14.878 align:start position:0%
derry and i know it's going to sound
 
05:05:15.990 --> 05:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
shocking but
 
05:05:17.590 --> 05:05:17.600 align:start position:0%
we are the fourth largest town but we do
 
05:05:20.550 --> 05:05:20.560 align:start position:0%
still have some active working farms
 
05:05:20.560 --> 05:05:21.590 align:start position:0%
still have some active working farms
there

05:05:21.590 --> 05:05:21.600 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:05:23.350 --> 05:05:23.360 align:start position:0%
they reiterated kind of the similar
 
05:05:24.788 --> 05:05:24.798 align:start position:0%
problem in the sense that you know
 
05:05:26.788 --> 05:05:26.798 align:start position:0%
they're asked well does it have a front
 
05:05:28.230 --> 05:05:28.240 align:start position:0%
end load loader does it have a back code
 
05:05:30.390 --> 05:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
as in and that seemed to
 
05:05:32.550 --> 05:05:32.560 align:start position:0%
matter into them trying to get these
 
05:05:34.550 --> 05:05:34.560 align:start position:0%
people to register these things as as
 
05:05:36.310 --> 05:05:36.320 align:start position:0%
construction equipment
 
05:05:38.788 --> 05:05:38.798 align:start position:0%
so giving it some thought about you know
 
05:05:39.910 --> 05:05:39.920 align:start position:0%
how do we
 
05:05:41.750 --> 05:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
how do we take
 
05:05:43.430 --> 05:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
these antique things that are used
 
05:05:45.510 --> 05:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
primarily for display in
 
05:05:47.590 --> 05:05:47.600 align:start position:0%
in historical purposes and how do we
 
05:05:49.350 --> 05:05:49.360 align:start position:0%
kind of straighten out
 
05:05:50.948 --> 05:05:50.958 align:start position:0%
this confusion
 
05:05:53.110 --> 05:05:53.120 align:start position:0%
for these guys to to actually register
 
05:05:54.310 --> 05:05:54.320 align:start position:0%
this and
 
05:05:55.830 --> 05:05:55.840 align:start position:0%
you know as someone who owns antique
 
05:05:58.310 --> 05:05:58.320 align:start position:0%
automobiles it it kind of seemed to me
 
05:06:00.230 --> 05:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
like a pretty simple solution if we can
 
05:06:01.830 --> 05:06:01.840 align:start position:0%
if i can register a car as an antique
 
05:06:03.190 --> 05:06:03.200 align:start position:0%
how come i can't register a tractor as
 
05:06:04.628 --> 05:06:04.638 align:start position:0%
an antique
 
05:06:07.190 --> 05:06:07.200 align:start position:0%
so in discussing this with
 
05:06:10.390 --> 05:06:10.400 align:start position:0%
ols and you know how do we how do we
 
05:06:11.910 --> 05:06:11.920 align:start position:0%
tackle this problem they said well you
 
05:06:13.430 --> 05:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
know we can just pretty put much put
 
05:06:14.708 --> 05:06:14.718 align:start position:0%
farm tractors in with all the other
 
05:06:16.310 --> 05:06:16.320 align:start position:0%
antiques so
 
05:06:17.830 --> 05:06:17.840 align:start position:0%
that's pretty much what this legislation
 
05:06:18.868 --> 05:06:18.878 align:start position:0%
does it
 
05:06:20.390 --> 05:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
it just adds the
 
05:06:22.390 --> 05:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
phrase farm tractor into the other areas
 
05:06:25.110 --> 05:06:25.120 align:start position:0%
of statute as in motor vehicles
 
05:06:27.270 --> 05:06:27.280 align:start position:0%
motorcycles those sort of things
 
05:06:29.510 --> 05:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
and puts them into statute as a as a
 
05:06:31.110 --> 05:06:31.120 align:start position:0%
class of vehicle just like any other
 
05:06:33.030 --> 05:06:33.040 align:start position:0%
class of vehicle
 
05:06:34.150 --> 05:06:34.160 align:start position:0%
and as you go through the bill you'll
 
05:06:35.350 --> 05:06:35.360 align:start position:0%
see that that's
 
05:06:38.470 --> 05:06:38.480 align:start position:0%
there's no new definitions as far as you
 
05:06:40.150 --> 05:06:40.160 align:start position:0%
know how we look at things there's no
 
05:06:43.910 --> 05:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:45.910 --> 05:06:45.920 align:start position:0%
anything no new references it just
 
05:06:48.868 --> 05:06:48.878 align:start position:0%
literally adds the farm tractor
 
05:06:50.868 --> 05:06:50.878 align:start position:0%
in with the antique motor vehicle
 
05:06:54.310 --> 05:06:54.320 align:start position:0%
motorcycle trailer etc
 
05:06:57.030 --> 05:06:57.040 align:start position:0%
so the the plan here the goal the hope
 
05:06:58.470 --> 05:06:58.480 align:start position:0%
is that
 
05:07:00.390 --> 05:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
in doing so when folks come before their
 
05:07:01.590 --> 05:07:01.600 align:start position:0%
town clerk
 
05:07:03.110 --> 05:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
they can simply say i i'm here to
 
05:07:05.430 --> 05:07:05.440 align:start position:0%
register my antique tractor
 
05:07:06.948 --> 05:07:06.958 align:start position:0%
and now
 
05:07:08.868 --> 05:07:08.878 align:start position:0%
all of the rest of these problems go
 
05:07:08.878 --> 05:07:12.708 align:start position:0%
all of the rest of these problems go
away

05:07:12.708 --> 05:07:12.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:16.150 --> 05:07:16.160 align:start position:0%
and that is the gist of what 1437 is
 
05:07:17.190 --> 05:07:17.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:07:19.990 --> 05:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
 
05:07:21.590 --> 05:07:21.600 align:start position:0%
representative telersky
 
05:07:22.708 --> 05:07:22.718 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
05:07:24.310 --> 05:07:24.320 align:start position:0%
question how come they can't just
 
05:07:25.830 --> 05:07:25.840 align:start position:0%
register it as isn't there an
 
05:07:27.830 --> 05:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
agricultural plate
 
05:07:29.510 --> 05:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
an agricultural plate to my
 
05:07:30.948 --> 05:07:30.958 align:start position:0%
understanding would apply to a pickup
 
05:07:33.990 --> 05:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
truck or an 18-wheeler tractors have
 
05:07:35.110 --> 05:07:35.120 align:start position:0%
we've had tractor plates in new
 
05:07:36.948 --> 05:07:36.958 align:start position:0%
hampshire for a long time
 
05:07:38.628 --> 05:07:38.638 align:start position:0%
um but so they're not considered
 
05:07:38.638 --> 05:07:40.788 align:start position:0%
um but so they're not considered
agricultural

05:07:40.788 --> 05:07:40.798 align:start position:0%
agricultural
 
05:07:43.110 --> 05:07:43.120 align:start position:0%
in under that provision of the law that
 
05:07:45.990 --> 05:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
that's again more for 18 wheelers in
 
05:07:49.110 --> 05:07:49.120 align:start position:0%
pickup trucks and things like that
 
05:07:49.120 --> 05:07:49.990 align:start position:0%
pickup trucks and things like that
okay

05:07:49.990 --> 05:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:07:52.310 --> 05:07:52.320 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
05:07:53.750 --> 05:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
representative fenton
 
05:07:55.190 --> 05:07:55.200 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for taking my question
 
05:07:57.110 --> 05:07:57.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here um
 
05:08:00.788 --> 05:08:00.798 align:start position:0%
so if i if these were
 
05:08:04.150 --> 05:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
licensed as a antique tractor vehicle
 
05:08:05.830 --> 05:08:05.840 align:start position:0%
would that mean i'm
 
05:08:07.830 --> 05:08:07.840 align:start position:0%
i'm now i'm allowed to drive it more on
 
05:08:09.510 --> 05:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
the roads so i could use it as a
 
05:08:13.030 --> 05:08:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:17.030 --> 05:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
no um a a farm tractor would hardly be
 
05:08:19.590 --> 05:08:19.600 align:start position:0%
classified by anyone as a as a motor
 
05:08:21.030 --> 05:08:21.040 align:start position:0%
vehicle that would you would use to go
 
05:08:23.590 --> 05:08:23.600 align:start position:0%
get groceries or things of that nature
 
05:08:23.600 --> 05:08:24.470 align:start position:0%
get groceries or things of that nature
um

05:08:24.470 --> 05:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:08:26.230 --> 05:08:26.240 align:start position:0%
these things i said these are primarily
 
05:08:28.788 --> 05:08:28.798 align:start position:0%
used for antique display as in
 
05:08:29.910 --> 05:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
what we saw you know you see at the
 
05:08:31.190 --> 05:08:31.200 align:start position:0%
deerfield fair and other fairs across
 
05:08:34.070 --> 05:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
new hampshire um you see them primarily
 
05:08:35.990 --> 05:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
they'll they may pull a wagon in an old
 
05:08:38.230 --> 05:08:38.240 align:start position:0%
homes parade or things like that
 
05:08:39.190 --> 05:08:39.200 align:start position:0%
they're certainly not used for
 
05:08:40.868 --> 05:08:40.878 align:start position:0%
commercial enterprise they're not
 
05:08:42.550 --> 05:08:42.560 align:start position:0%
they're so old you would never risk an
 
05:08:42.560 --> 05:08:43.510 align:start position:0%
they're so old you would never risk an
antique

05:08:43.510 --> 05:08:43.520 align:start position:0%
antique
 
05:08:45.670 --> 05:08:45.680 align:start position:0%
you know in that venture anyway and by
 
05:08:47.350 --> 05:08:47.360 align:start position:0%
putting them into the statute as an
 
05:08:47.360 --> 05:08:48.390 align:start position:0%
putting them into the statute as an
antique

05:08:48.390 --> 05:08:48.400 align:start position:0%
antique
 
05:08:49.990 --> 05:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
not only do you
 
05:08:52.470 --> 05:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
have what you could argue is the benefit
 
05:08:53.750 --> 05:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
of them being in antiques but you also
 
05:08:55.270 --> 05:08:55.280 align:start position:0%
have the restrictions
 
05:08:55.280 --> 05:08:56.230 align:start position:0%
have the restrictions
so

05:08:56.230 --> 05:08:56.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:08:57.990 --> 05:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
you know and in discussing that with the
 
05:08:58.000 --> 05:08:58.868 align:start position:0%
you know and in discussing that with the
folks

05:08:58.868 --> 05:08:58.878 align:start position:0%
folks
 
05:09:00.070 --> 05:09:00.080 align:start position:0%
you know they looked at me and said well
 
05:09:01.350 --> 05:09:01.360 align:start position:0%
this is this is the world we're in
 
05:09:03.590 --> 05:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
anyway you know again i'm i'm not taking
 
05:09:05.910 --> 05:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
a tractor built in the 1950s and
 
05:09:08.310 --> 05:09:08.320 align:start position:0%
doing you know commercial work with it
 
05:09:10.070 --> 05:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
because the risk of breaking it is just
 
05:09:12.708 --> 05:09:12.718 align:start position:0%
entirely too high so so this you know
 
05:09:14.070 --> 05:09:14.080 align:start position:0%
these are
 
05:09:15.830 --> 05:09:15.840 align:start position:0%
these are by no means you know motor
 
05:09:15.840 --> 05:09:16.948 align:start position:0%
these are by no means you know motor
vehicles

05:09:16.948 --> 05:09:16.958 align:start position:0%
vehicles
 
05:09:18.708 --> 05:09:18.718 align:start position:0%
in that sense
 
05:09:21.190 --> 05:09:21.200 align:start position:0%
okay thank you you also with that
 
05:09:22.708 --> 05:09:22.718 align:start position:0%
because it is if you want to take a look
 
05:09:24.550 --> 05:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
uh the restriction he's talking about
 
05:09:26.550 --> 05:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
look at lines four and five
 
05:09:28.708 --> 05:09:28.718 align:start position:0%
uh and actually it should be easy to see
 
05:09:30.868 --> 05:09:30.878 align:start position:0%
how these would comply
 
05:09:32.868 --> 05:09:32.878 align:start position:0%
for those that don't know this is a huge
 
05:09:34.628 --> 05:09:34.638 align:start position:0%
hobby in the state of new hampshire it's
 
05:09:36.788 --> 05:09:36.798 align:start position:0%
actually pretty fascinating
 
05:09:39.990 --> 05:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
05:09:42.310 --> 05:09:42.320 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
05:09:43.750 --> 05:09:43.760 align:start position:0%
you for your time thank you um that's
 
05:09:43.760 --> 05:09:44.470 align:start position:0%
you for your time thank you um that's
the

05:09:44.470 --> 05:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:09:46.550 --> 05:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
only pink card i have mr obertank you
 
05:09:55.990 --> 05:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:57.430 --> 05:09:57.440 align:start position:0%
good afternoon mr chairman and members
 
05:09:58.628 --> 05:09:58.638 align:start position:0%
of the committee and just to answer a
 
05:10:00.230 --> 05:10:00.240 align:start position:0%
couple of questions different plate
 
05:10:00.240 --> 05:10:01.110 align:start position:0%
couple of questions different plate
types

05:10:01.110 --> 05:10:01.120 align:start position:0%
types
 
05:10:02.628 --> 05:10:02.638 align:start position:0%
really determine what the use of the
 
05:10:04.390 --> 05:10:04.400 align:start position:0%
vehicle is so if there's some confusion
 
05:10:06.070 --> 05:10:06.080 align:start position:0%
out there there's also confusion on what
 
05:10:07.830 --> 05:10:07.840 align:start position:0%
some of these folks use those
 
05:10:10.230 --> 05:10:10.240 align:start position:0%
vehicles for but this is pretty clear
 
05:10:12.390 --> 05:10:12.400 align:start position:0%
that it's not for use in commerce and
 
05:10:14.070 --> 05:10:14.080 align:start position:0%
it's not to be used on a public way for
 
05:10:16.390 --> 05:10:16.400 align:start position:0%
everyday use it really does
 
05:10:19.670 --> 05:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
limit you to a couple of activities
 
05:10:21.430 --> 05:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
and again the only concern from us is
 
05:10:23.110 --> 05:10:23.120 align:start position:0%
that somebody's trying to find a cheaper
 
05:10:24.948 --> 05:10:24.958 align:start position:0%
way to register vehicles which we spend
 
05:10:26.230 --> 05:10:26.240 align:start position:0%
a lot of our time having those
 
05:10:26.240 --> 05:10:27.430 align:start position:0%
a lot of our time having those
discussions

05:10:27.430 --> 05:10:27.440 align:start position:0%
discussions
 
05:10:29.350 --> 05:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
that if it's being used for agriculture
 
05:10:31.270 --> 05:10:31.280 align:start position:0%
and farm use then it doesn't qualify for
 
05:10:33.110 --> 05:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
an antique plate it has to be registered
 
05:10:35.110 --> 05:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
as a farm plate
 
05:10:37.910 --> 05:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
as a farm tractor
 
05:10:39.510 --> 05:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
and again that comes up to if you're
 
05:10:41.190 --> 05:10:41.200 align:start position:0%
pulling a trailer down the roadway full
 
05:10:42.150 --> 05:10:42.160 align:start position:0%
of hay
 
05:10:43.670 --> 05:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
then you're not in the antique use and
 
05:10:45.670 --> 05:10:45.680 align:start position:0%
you're in violation
 
05:10:47.190 --> 05:10:47.200 align:start position:0%
and there are
 
05:10:49.110 --> 05:10:49.120 align:start position:0%
protocols in play for those things to be
 
05:10:51.110 --> 05:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
dealt with we can recall plates
 
05:10:53.270 --> 05:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
administrative hearings police can take
 
05:10:54.868 --> 05:10:54.878 align:start position:0%
the plates those types of things so
 
05:10:54.878 --> 05:10:55.590 align:start position:0%
the plates those types of things so
those

05:10:55.590 --> 05:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
those
 
05:10:58.150 --> 05:10:58.160 align:start position:0%
barriers are in effect
 
05:11:00.708 --> 05:11:00.718 align:start position:0%
so safe to say um
 
05:11:02.868 --> 05:11:02.878 align:start position:0%
and you don't what you you don't have to
 
05:11:04.628 --> 05:11:04.638 align:start position:0%
but without seeing the pink card which i
 
05:11:06.070 --> 05:11:06.080 align:start position:0%
still need to by the way
 
05:11:07.990 --> 05:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
would the department be fine with this
 
05:11:09.350 --> 05:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation the way it's being
 
05:11:11.590 --> 05:11:11.600 align:start position:0%
proposed absolutely okay thank you for
 
05:11:11.600 --> 05:11:12.628 align:start position:0%
proposed absolutely okay thank you for
that

05:11:12.628 --> 05:11:12.638 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:11:16.230 --> 05:11:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:16.240 --> 05:11:17.830 align:start position:0%
 
good

05:11:17.830 --> 05:11:17.840 align:start position:0%
good
 
05:11:17.840 --> 05:11:18.708 align:start position:0%
good
okay

relative to the registration plates for
 
05:18:53.350 --> 05:18:53.360 align:start position:0%

05:19:21.190 --> 05:19:21.200 align:start position:0%
there is a community out there that um

seems to want this um it doesn't seem as
 
05:19:27.590 --> 05:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
though that there's much risk of abuse
 
05:19:29.750 --> 05:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
in terms of the um

05:37:02.470 --> 05:37:02.480 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
05:37:02.480 --> 05:37:06.070 align:start position:0%
house bill
1445-fn

05:37:06.070 --> 05:37:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:07.990 --> 05:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
my intent with this bill is to have
 
05:37:09.990 --> 05:37:10.000 align:start position:0%
police vehicles that are being used for
 
05:37:12.948 --> 05:37:12.958 align:start position:0%
normal police functions be
 
05:37:15.910 --> 05:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
fully marked and identifiable
 
05:37:18.230 --> 05:37:18.240 align:start position:0%
this is for the safety of the public and
 
05:37:21.190 --> 05:37:21.200 align:start position:0%
the offices themselves across the entire
 
05:37:21.200 --> 05:37:22.150 align:start position:0%
the offices themselves across the entire
state

05:37:22.150 --> 05:37:22.160 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:37:24.548 --> 05:37:24.558 align:start position:0%
i have seen more
 
05:37:27.430 --> 05:37:27.440 align:start position:0%
and more of completely unmarked police
 
05:37:30.150 --> 05:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
vehicles being used for normal police
 
05:37:30.160 --> 05:37:32.310 align:start position:0%
vehicles being used for normal police
functions

05:37:32.310 --> 05:37:32.320 align:start position:0%
functions
 
05:37:34.868 --> 05:37:34.878 align:start position:0%
these vehicles have no visible marking
 
05:37:38.070 --> 05:37:38.080 align:start position:0%
running regular license plates or also
 
05:37:40.628 --> 05:37:40.638 align:start position:0%
ghost plates
 
05:37:43.030 --> 05:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
and running low profile lights in the
 
05:37:45.350 --> 05:37:45.360 align:start position:0%
front and back windows
 
05:37:47.670 --> 05:37:47.680 align:start position:0%
this makes it almost impossible for the
 
05:37:49.990 --> 05:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
public to determine if these are
 
05:37:52.230 --> 05:37:52.240 align:start position:0%
legitimate police vehicles
 
05:37:54.470 --> 05:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
these normal functions would include
 
05:37:57.830 --> 05:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle stops responding to
 
05:38:02.708 --> 05:38:02.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:02.718 --> 05:38:04.230 align:start position:0%
 
calls

05:38:04.230 --> 05:38:04.240 align:start position:0%
calls
 
05:38:07.430 --> 05:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
traffic control or enforcement special
 
05:38:10.230 --> 05:38:10.240 align:start position:0%
detail enforcement for a
 
05:38:12.310 --> 05:38:12.320 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle
 
05:38:16.708 --> 05:38:16.718 align:start position:0%
like dwi speeds and things like that
 
05:38:18.628 --> 05:38:18.638 align:start position:0%
my concern is citizens are purchasing
 
05:38:21.110 --> 05:38:21.120 align:start position:0%
retired police vehicles
 
05:38:23.590 --> 05:38:23.600 align:start position:0%
and driving them daily i have personally
 
05:38:25.110 --> 05:38:25.120 align:start position:0%
seen some of these vehicles with
 
05:38:27.990 --> 05:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
spotlights and clear light bars on the
 
05:38:31.270 --> 05:38:31.280 align:start position:0%
roof and in the windows
 
05:38:33.030 --> 05:38:33.040 align:start position:0%
these same
 
05:38:35.350 --> 05:38:35.360 align:start position:0%
they they appear to be as a normal
 
05:38:38.310 --> 05:38:38.320 align:start position:0%
police vehicle or cruiser although when
 
05:38:38.320 --> 05:38:39.430 align:start position:0%
police vehicle or cruiser although when
asked

05:38:39.430 --> 05:38:39.440 align:start position:0%
asked
 
05:38:41.750 --> 05:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
the vehicle's owners about the lights on
 
05:38:43.270 --> 05:38:43.280 align:start position:0%
their vehicles they always say they're
 
05:38:46.708 --> 05:38:46.718 align:start position:0%
amber however many of these light bars
 
05:38:48.470 --> 05:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
that are being purchased today have the
 
05:38:51.110 --> 05:38:51.120 align:start position:0%
capability of changing from amber to
 
05:38:51.120 --> 05:38:52.070 align:start position:0%
capability of changing from amber to
blue

05:38:52.070 --> 05:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
blue
 
05:38:55.590 --> 05:38:55.600 align:start position:0%
and to red with a flick of a switch
 
05:38:57.990 --> 05:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
people can order uniforms and badges
 
05:38:58.000 --> 05:38:59.670 align:start position:0%
people can order uniforms and badges
online

05:38:59.670 --> 05:38:59.680 align:start position:0%
online
 
05:39:01.830 --> 05:39:01.840 align:start position:0%
this makes it harder for the public to
 
05:39:03.590 --> 05:39:03.600 align:start position:0%
be able to determine if it's a real
 
05:39:07.910 --> 05:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:09.670 --> 05:39:09.680 align:start position:0%
across the country there has been an
 
05:39:13.110 --> 05:39:13.120 align:start position:0%
increase in police impersonators
 
05:39:16.310 --> 05:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
another concern with the ghost plate
 
05:39:17.830 --> 05:39:17.840 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if you're familiar with
 
05:39:20.390 --> 05:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
ghost plates but these are plates that
 
05:39:22.548 --> 05:39:22.558 align:start position:0%
are issued directly from the pomodo
 
05:39:23.910 --> 05:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle
 
05:39:27.430 --> 05:39:27.440 align:start position:0%
that are almost impossible to trace
 
05:39:29.590 --> 05:39:29.600 align:start position:0%
by other law enforcement off
 
05:39:31.830 --> 05:39:31.840 align:start position:0%
offices they cannot just run the license
 
05:39:33.910 --> 05:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
plate and come up with what department
 
05:39:35.590 --> 05:39:35.600 align:start position:0%
owns those vehicles or what vehicles
 
05:39:37.270 --> 05:39:37.280 align:start position:0%
they should be on
 
05:39:38.708 --> 05:39:38.718 align:start position:0%
so that's why they're called ghost
 
05:39:38.718 --> 05:39:44.788 align:start position:0%
so that's why they're called ghost
plates

05:39:44.788 --> 05:39:44.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:46.390 --> 05:39:46.400 align:start position:0%
if there's a complaint made against a
 
05:39:48.150 --> 05:39:48.160 align:start position:0%
vehicle that has a ghost plate the
 
05:39:50.708 --> 05:39:50.718 align:start position:0%
agency receiving the complaint must file
 
05:39:52.548 --> 05:39:52.558 align:start position:0%
a letter with the department of motor
 
05:39:54.070 --> 05:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
vehicle to obtain
 
05:39:56.788 --> 05:39:56.798 align:start position:0%
the information on the vehicle
 
05:39:58.628 --> 05:39:58.638 align:start position:0%
in which department the plate is
 
05:40:00.390 --> 05:40:00.400 align:start position:0%
registered to
 
05:40:02.868 --> 05:40:02.878 align:start position:0%
if a complaint is filed on a weekend
 
05:40:04.470 --> 05:40:04.480 align:start position:0%
say a friday night
 
05:40:07.350 --> 05:40:07.360 align:start position:0%
the investigation could be delayed
 
05:40:09.350 --> 05:40:09.360 align:start position:0%
you might hear in the future testimony
 
05:40:12.310 --> 05:40:12.320 align:start position:0%
that these plates are being used as
 
05:40:15.590 --> 05:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
undercover investigative tools
 
05:40:17.990 --> 05:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
so they cannot be identified
 
05:40:18.000 --> 05:40:20.390 align:start position:0%
so they cannot be identified
however

05:40:20.390 --> 05:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
however
 
05:40:22.070 --> 05:40:22.080 align:start position:0%
people in the public cannot just call an
 
05:40:24.310 --> 05:40:24.320 align:start position:0%
agency and ask them to run a license
 
05:40:26.150 --> 05:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
plate and get that information
 
05:40:27.830 --> 05:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
so i don't know why we need these ghost
 
05:40:27.840 --> 05:40:29.270 align:start position:0%
so i don't know why we need these ghost
planes

05:40:29.270 --> 05:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
planes
 
05:40:29.280 --> 05:40:31.670 align:start position:0%
planes
um

05:40:31.670 --> 05:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:40:33.430 --> 05:40:33.440 align:start position:0%
most of the ghost plates are being used
 
05:40:34.628 --> 05:40:34.638 align:start position:0%
on police
 
05:40:37.910 --> 05:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
administrative vehicles chiefs captains
 
05:40:39.910 --> 05:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
and things like that not undercover
 
05:40:39.920 --> 05:40:41.030 align:start position:0%
and things like that not undercover
vehicles

05:40:41.030 --> 05:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
vehicles
 
05:40:41.040 --> 05:40:42.788 align:start position:0%
vehicles
however

05:40:42.788 --> 05:40:42.798 align:start position:0%
however
 
05:40:44.230 --> 05:40:44.240 align:start position:0%
these are the same vehicles that are
 
05:40:47.190 --> 05:40:47.200 align:start position:0%
being used to stop vehicles responding
 
05:40:50.310 --> 05:40:50.320 align:start position:0%
to emergency and non-emergency calls
 
05:40:52.548 --> 05:40:52.558 align:start position:0%
i feel unmarked vehicles with regular
 
05:40:54.230 --> 05:40:54.240 align:start position:0%
license plates
 
05:40:58.070 --> 05:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:00.548 --> 05:41:00.558 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned in the bill itself
 
05:41:02.150 --> 05:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
some of those will include drug
 
05:41:02.160 --> 05:41:03.830 align:start position:0%
some of those will include drug
enforcement

05:41:03.830 --> 05:41:03.840 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
05:41:10.310 --> 05:41:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:12.708 --> 05:41:12.718 align:start position:0%
however transparency and visibility is
 
05:41:15.270 --> 05:41:15.280 align:start position:0%
very important in law enforcement
 
05:41:19.030 --> 05:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
visibility helps deter criminal activity
 
05:41:21.350 --> 05:41:21.360 align:start position:0%
and make it easier for the
 
05:41:23.830 --> 05:41:23.840 align:start position:0%
public to pick out a police vehicle in
 
05:41:26.390 --> 05:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
the time of need
 
05:41:28.230 --> 05:41:28.240 align:start position:0%
with these unmarked vehicles with no
 
05:41:30.788 --> 05:41:30.798 align:start position:0%
identification marks either on the side
 
05:41:33.270 --> 05:41:33.280 align:start position:0%
a license plate or anything like that
 
05:41:34.948 --> 05:41:34.958 align:start position:0%
it's difficult
 
05:41:37.910 --> 05:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
to see it so a citizen might say that
 
05:41:40.310 --> 05:41:40.320 align:start position:0%
looks like a cruiser when it's actually
 
05:41:42.708 --> 05:41:42.718 align:start position:0%
a civilian that owns that vehicle that
 
05:41:45.830 --> 05:41:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:47.990 --> 05:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
i had a police chief tell me recently he
 
05:41:50.390 --> 05:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
drives a fully marked un
 
05:41:53.670 --> 05:41:53.680 align:start position:0%
mock vehicle from home to work he told
 
05:41:56.548 --> 05:41:56.558 align:start position:0%
me he travels on i-93 and has
 
05:41:58.788 --> 05:41:58.798 align:start position:0%
had vehicles past him at i believe 80 or
 
05:42:00.708 --> 05:42:00.718 align:start position:0%
90 miles an hour
 
05:42:02.390 --> 05:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
he said
 
05:42:04.390 --> 05:42:04.400 align:start position:0%
he is able to stop them because they
 
05:42:05.750 --> 05:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
could not tell
 
05:42:09.110 --> 05:42:09.120 align:start position:0%
his his vehicle was a cruiser
 
05:42:11.430 --> 05:42:11.440 align:start position:0%
however i feel that if his cruiser was
 
05:42:11.440 --> 05:42:12.548 align:start position:0%
however i feel that if his cruiser was
mocked

05:42:12.548 --> 05:42:12.558 align:start position:0%
mocked
 
05:42:14.788 --> 05:42:14.798 align:start position:0%
and had the appropriate plate the person
 
05:42:17.270 --> 05:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
that was speeding would have saw that
 
05:42:18.948 --> 05:42:18.958 align:start position:0%
and slowed down and that would have
 
05:42:22.628 --> 05:42:22.638 align:start position:0%
deterred the violation of law
 
05:42:24.390 --> 05:42:24.400 align:start position:0%
it's not always about
 
05:42:26.628 --> 05:42:26.638 align:start position:0%
the apprehension it's about
 
05:42:28.628 --> 05:42:28.638 align:start position:0%
you know deterring the crime before it
 
05:42:28.638 --> 05:42:32.310 align:start position:0%
you know deterring the crime before it
happens

05:42:32.310 --> 05:42:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:34.070 --> 05:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
i feel that if there's crews that had
 
05:42:36.310 --> 05:42:36.320 align:start position:0%
the municipal county or state license
 
05:42:37.990 --> 05:42:38.000 align:start position:0%
plates that are on most
 
05:42:38.000 --> 05:42:39.670 align:start position:0%
plates that are on most
cruises

05:42:39.670 --> 05:42:39.680 align:start position:0%
cruises
 
05:42:42.628 --> 05:42:42.638 align:start position:0%
that would have stopped the problem
 
05:42:45.990 --> 05:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
actually some states right now
 
05:42:46.000 --> 05:42:47.270 align:start position:0%
actually some states right now
um

05:42:47.270 --> 05:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:42:50.548 --> 05:42:50.558 align:start position:0%
i'm mandating um that their vehicles uh
 
05:42:51.910 --> 05:42:51.920 align:start position:0%
run a
 
05:42:53.990 --> 05:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
solid blue light when they're just
 
05:42:56.230 --> 05:42:56.240 align:start position:0%
driving around i saw there's um
 
05:42:57.670 --> 05:42:57.680 align:start position:0%
scarborough maine that just started
 
05:42:58.788 --> 05:42:58.798 align:start position:0%
doing that
 
05:43:01.270 --> 05:43:01.280 align:start position:0%
i believe it's connecticut um state
 
05:43:01.280 --> 05:43:03.270 align:start position:0%
i believe it's connecticut um state
police

05:43:03.270 --> 05:43:03.280 align:start position:0%
police
 
05:43:05.510 --> 05:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
has that capability of running a solid
 
05:43:07.750 --> 05:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
blue light on their cruises to be
 
05:43:10.470 --> 05:43:10.480 align:start position:0%
identified easier and also a study has
 
05:43:12.390 --> 05:43:12.400 align:start position:0%
shown that these lights or the
 
05:43:14.070 --> 05:43:14.080 align:start position:0%
visibility has
 
05:43:16.470 --> 05:43:16.480 align:start position:0%
decreased criminal activity
 
05:43:19.110 --> 05:43:19.120 align:start position:0%
and it has been easier for
 
05:43:21.750 --> 05:43:21.760 align:start position:0%
citizens to pick out cruises and when
 
05:43:25.990 --> 05:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:28.310 --> 05:43:28.320 align:start position:0%
um last session the governor signed into
 
05:43:30.390 --> 05:43:30.400 align:start position:0%
law the law enforcement
 
05:43:31.910 --> 05:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
reform bill
 
05:43:34.548 --> 05:43:34.558 align:start position:0%
which is requiring training transparency
 
05:43:37.430 --> 05:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
and etc i feel this bill will help
 
05:43:40.230 --> 05:43:40.240 align:start position:0%
expand the governor's
 
05:43:42.708 --> 05:43:42.718 align:start position:0%
law enforcement reform bill and make it
 
05:43:44.390 --> 05:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
safer for everyone
 
05:43:48.150 --> 05:43:48.160 align:start position:0%
citizens and the um
 
05:43:48.160 --> 05:43:50.230 align:start position:0%
citizens and the um
public

05:43:50.230 --> 05:43:50.240 align:start position:0%
public
 
05:43:52.230 --> 05:43:52.240 align:start position:0%
one thing you know i would ask the
 
05:43:53.670 --> 05:43:53.680 align:start position:0%
committee if this is something they
 
05:43:55.750 --> 05:43:55.760 align:start position:0%
would consider is after speaking with
 
05:43:58.390 --> 05:43:58.400 align:start position:0%
some other police administrators is
 
05:44:01.590 --> 05:44:01.600 align:start position:0%
detectives vehicles
 
05:44:04.150 --> 05:44:04.160 align:start position:0%
i don't feel they need to be mocked
 
05:44:05.750 --> 05:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
or run the regular plates because
 
05:44:07.990 --> 05:44:08.000 align:start position:0%
they're not performing normal police
 
05:44:08.000 --> 05:44:09.110 align:start position:0%
they're not performing normal police
functions

05:44:09.110 --> 05:44:09.120 align:start position:0%
functions
 
05:44:11.350 --> 05:44:11.360 align:start position:0%
however if they're going to use those
 
05:44:11.360 --> 05:44:12.628 align:start position:0%
however if they're going to use those
vehicles

05:44:12.628 --> 05:44:12.638 align:start position:0%
vehicles
 
05:44:14.788 --> 05:44:14.798 align:start position:0%
for normal functions you know they're
 
05:44:17.910 --> 05:44:17.920 align:start position:0%
assigned to a dwi patrol
 
05:44:20.868 --> 05:44:20.878 align:start position:0%
over a holiday weekend or an enfor a
 
05:44:24.548 --> 05:44:24.558 align:start position:0%
traffic or a speed enforcement
 
05:44:27.430 --> 05:44:27.440 align:start position:0%
assignment that the minimum they put on
 
05:44:29.830 --> 05:44:29.840 align:start position:0%
is their appropriate plate if it's a
 
05:44:31.270 --> 05:44:31.280 align:start position:0%
state it'll be a
 
05:44:34.070 --> 05:44:34.080 align:start position:0%
trooper they can put on a state license
 
05:44:36.390 --> 05:44:36.400 align:start position:0%
plate if it's a county a county plate or
 
05:44:39.910 --> 05:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
a municipal a municipal plate at least
 
05:44:42.628 --> 05:44:42.638 align:start position:0%
it shows some
 
05:44:45.070 --> 05:44:45.080 align:start position:0%
visibility and transparency
 
05:44:45.080 --> 05:44:46.470 align:start position:0%
visibility and transparency
[Music]

05:44:46.470 --> 05:44:46.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:44:48.390 --> 05:44:48.400 align:start position:0%
whereas without those types of plates
 
05:44:50.470 --> 05:44:50.480 align:start position:0%
there's no identification
 
05:44:52.470 --> 05:44:52.480 align:start position:0%
at all and
 
05:44:55.910 --> 05:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:58.150 --> 05:44:58.160 align:start position:0%
unless a citizen steals one of those
 
05:45:00.708 --> 05:45:00.718 align:start position:0%
license plates they're
 
05:45:04.708 --> 05:45:04.718 align:start position:0%
impossible to get by a civilian
 
05:45:07.270 --> 05:45:07.280 align:start position:0%
after looking at the fiscal note
 
05:45:09.190 --> 05:45:09.200 align:start position:0%
i see state police said that they have
 
05:45:12.470 --> 05:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
115 cruises um that do not meet the
 
05:45:14.390 --> 05:45:14.400 align:start position:0%
requirements of this bill
 
05:45:16.948 --> 05:45:16.958 align:start position:0%
and they said the it would cost um
 
05:45:19.110 --> 05:45:19.120 align:start position:0%
316 000
 
05:45:19.120 --> 05:45:20.470 align:start position:0%
316 000
to

05:45:20.470 --> 05:45:20.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:45:22.788 --> 05:45:22.798 align:start position:0%
bring those cruises up to specs
 
05:45:24.150 --> 05:45:24.160 align:start position:0%
of this bill
 
05:45:25.910 --> 05:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
however um
 
05:45:27.590 --> 05:45:27.600 align:start position:0%
i'm not asking the painting which is
 
05:45:30.390 --> 05:45:30.400 align:start position:0%
part of the fiscal note for i think
 
05:45:31.990 --> 05:45:32.000 align:start position:0%
twenty six hundred dollars all i was
 
05:45:35.590 --> 05:45:35.600 align:start position:0%
asking was the part of the decals which
 
05:45:37.670 --> 05:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
are 120 dollars
 
05:45:41.670 --> 05:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
but i do not feel all their cruises need
 
05:45:43.750 --> 05:45:43.760 align:start position:0%
um these details like i said the
 
05:45:43.760 --> 05:45:45.350 align:start position:0%
um these details like i said the
detectives

05:45:45.350 --> 05:45:45.360 align:start position:0%
detectives
 
05:45:45.360 --> 05:45:47.670 align:start position:0%
detectives
um

05:45:47.670 --> 05:45:47.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:45:49.430 --> 05:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
and the administrative that does not
 
05:45:53.430 --> 05:45:53.440 align:start position:0%
usually go out on regular patrol
 
05:45:55.030 --> 05:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
they might run into an accident on the
 
05:45:57.270 --> 05:45:57.280 align:start position:0%
way home or to work
 
05:45:59.750 --> 05:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
something like that that would be fine i
 
05:46:02.390 --> 05:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
my goal with this bill is to
 
05:46:02.400 --> 05:46:03.590 align:start position:0%
my goal with this bill is to
show

05:46:03.590 --> 05:46:03.600 align:start position:0%
show
 
05:46:06.070 --> 05:46:06.080 align:start position:0%
transparency and visibility
 
05:46:07.670 --> 05:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
with the vehicles that are out there on
 
05:46:10.390 --> 05:46:10.400 align:start position:0%
a regular basis i have seen
 
05:46:12.868 --> 05:46:12.878 align:start position:0%
many many police administrators or
 
05:46:15.750 --> 05:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
police chiefs in my county alone running
 
05:46:17.350 --> 05:46:17.360 align:start position:0%
these vehicles that are out stopping
 
05:46:19.910 --> 05:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
cars on a regular basis
 
05:46:22.230 --> 05:46:22.240 align:start position:0%
and also working
 
05:46:24.310 --> 05:46:24.320 align:start position:0%
extra duty in
 
05:46:27.670 --> 05:46:27.680 align:start position:0%
speed enforcement and in
 
05:46:30.310 --> 05:46:30.320 align:start position:0%
dwi detection
 
05:46:32.708 --> 05:46:32.718 align:start position:0%
apprehension so these are the concerns
 
05:46:34.470 --> 05:46:34.480 align:start position:0%
to me right there i'm not saying every
 
05:46:37.110 --> 05:46:37.120 align:start position:0%
single cruiser needs to be mocked
 
05:46:40.230 --> 05:46:40.240 align:start position:0%
as i stated here in the bill itself i
 
05:46:42.150 --> 05:46:42.160 align:start position:0%
mean the one thing i would ask that if
 
05:46:43.710 --> 05:46:43.720 align:start position:0%
the committee does
 
05:46:43.720 --> 05:46:45.030 align:start position:0%
the committee does
[Music]

05:46:45.030 --> 05:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:46:46.390 --> 05:46:46.400 align:start position:0%
feel this is something that we need to
 
05:46:48.390 --> 05:46:48.400 align:start position:0%
pursue i would ask them maybe for an
 
05:46:49.910 --> 05:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
amendment adding
 
05:46:54.470 --> 05:46:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:56.470 --> 05:46:56.480 align:start position:0%
and at that point that's pretty much my
 
05:46:58.548 --> 05:46:58.558 align:start position:0%
testimony if there's any question i'll
 
05:47:01.430 --> 05:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
be more than happy to answer
 
05:47:02.708 --> 05:47:02.718 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
 
05:47:02.718 --> 05:47:04.548 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
committee

05:47:04.548 --> 05:47:04.558 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:47:05.670 --> 05:47:05.680 align:start position:0%
i do
 
05:47:05.680 --> 05:47:07.190 align:start position:0%
i do
representative

05:47:07.190 --> 05:47:07.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:47:09.030 --> 05:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for your
 
05:47:13.270 --> 05:47:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:16.310 --> 05:47:16.320 align:start position:0%
these uh unmarked cars
 
05:47:19.270 --> 05:47:19.280 align:start position:0%
i've seen them on the highways
 
05:47:21.910 --> 05:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
and they are pretty
 
05:47:24.948 --> 05:47:24.958 align:start position:0%
hard to identify as law enforcement now
 
05:47:27.110 --> 05:47:27.120 align:start position:0%
these ghost plates bother me
 
05:47:29.430 --> 05:47:29.440 align:start position:0%
would you be amenable to
 
05:47:33.030 --> 05:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
still they could still remain stealth
 
05:47:33.040 --> 05:47:34.150 align:start position:0%
still they could still remain stealth
okay

05:47:34.150 --> 05:47:34.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:47:35.670 --> 05:47:35.680 align:start position:0%
except for
 
05:47:37.270 --> 05:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
the plates would have to be government
 
05:47:37.280 --> 05:47:38.548 align:start position:0%
the plates would have to be government
plates

05:47:38.548 --> 05:47:38.558 align:start position:0%
plates
 
05:47:40.868 --> 05:47:40.878 align:start position:0%
yes i i'm willing to do that
 
05:47:42.548 --> 05:47:42.558 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:47:44.708 --> 05:47:44.718 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
05:47:46.868 --> 05:47:46.878 align:start position:0%
i have one if you don't mind
 
05:47:48.788 --> 05:47:48.798 align:start position:0%
um we have seen this bill before for a
 
05:47:51.030 --> 05:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
similar similar version of it
 
05:47:52.310 --> 05:47:52.320 align:start position:0%
and it sounds like you did a lot of
 
05:47:55.190 --> 05:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
communicating with uh police
 
05:47:57.830 --> 05:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
you mentioned sheriffs but state police
 
05:48:00.070 --> 05:48:00.080 align:start position:0%
we did have an issue and did you reach
 
05:48:01.990 --> 05:48:02.000 align:start position:0%
out to corrections
 
05:48:04.390 --> 05:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
because the county and the corrections
 
05:48:04.400 --> 05:48:05.510 align:start position:0%
because the county and the corrections
um

05:48:05.510 --> 05:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:48:07.270 --> 05:48:07.280 align:start position:0%
people have a lot of cruisers too many
 
05:48:08.470 --> 05:48:08.480 align:start position:0%
of them not
 
05:48:09.990 --> 05:48:10.000 align:start position:0%
and did you reach out to them at all to
 
05:48:12.708 --> 05:48:12.718 align:start position:0%
see how it might affect them i did not
 
05:48:14.948 --> 05:48:14.958 align:start position:0%
because i didn't um consider them as
 
05:48:18.230 --> 05:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
being out on normal patrol
 
05:48:18.240 --> 05:48:19.350 align:start position:0%
being out on normal patrol
basically

05:48:19.350 --> 05:48:19.360 align:start position:0%
basically
 
05:48:20.868 --> 05:48:20.878 align:start position:0%
you know the corrections are
 
05:48:23.190 --> 05:48:23.200 align:start position:0%
transporting you know inmates that are
 
05:48:25.670 --> 05:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
already being housed in a correctional
 
05:48:25.680 --> 05:48:26.948 align:start position:0%
already being housed in a correctional
facility

05:48:26.948 --> 05:48:26.958 align:start position:0%
facility
 
05:48:29.830 --> 05:48:29.840 align:start position:0%
they would not be the ones out there
 
05:48:31.510 --> 05:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
stopping vehicles
 
05:48:33.430 --> 05:48:33.440 align:start position:0%
they would not be the ones making
 
05:48:35.830 --> 05:48:35.840 align:start position:0%
contact with the citizens who
 
05:48:38.708 --> 05:48:38.718 align:start position:0%
are in need of help under most
 
05:48:41.030 --> 05:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
circumstances i mean if you know a
 
05:48:42.948 --> 05:48:42.958 align:start position:0%
correctional officer comes across an
 
05:48:46.310 --> 05:48:46.320 align:start position:0%
accident they might stop to render aid
 
05:48:47.830 --> 05:48:47.840 align:start position:0%
but other than that no i did not
 
05:48:49.990 --> 05:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
consider corrections
 
05:48:51.590 --> 05:48:51.600 align:start position:0%
thank you fair enough actually lions 10
 
05:48:53.830 --> 05:48:53.840 align:start position:0%
through 12 might take care of that
 
05:48:56.230 --> 05:48:56.240 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
05:48:57.990 --> 05:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
cnn thank you very much thank you very

hello
 
05:49:30.628 --> 05:49:30.638 align:start position:0%
hi good afternoon chairman walsh members
 
05:49:32.390 --> 05:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is elizabeth
 
05:49:34.230 --> 05:49:34.240 align:start position:0%
sargent i work for she infinity capital
 
05:49:36.150 --> 05:49:36.160 align:start position:0%
group here in concord here representing
 
05:49:38.070 --> 05:49:38.080 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire association of chiefs
 
05:49:39.590 --> 05:49:39.600 align:start position:0%
of police
 
05:49:42.390 --> 05:49:42.400 align:start position:0%
we are in opposition to this bill
 
05:49:45.030 --> 05:49:45.040 align:start position:0%
i was not prepared to testify
 
05:49:46.628 --> 05:49:46.638 align:start position:0%
chief obecky was hoping to make it but
 
05:49:48.230 --> 05:49:48.240 align:start position:0%
he can't so i'm just going to wing it a
 
05:49:49.750 --> 05:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
05:49:51.990 --> 05:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
and just read from my notes
 
05:49:54.070 --> 05:49:54.080 align:start position:0%
that i quickly put together but the
 
05:49:57.190 --> 05:49:57.200 align:start position:0%
chiefs are in opposition to this bill
 
05:49:59.590 --> 05:49:59.600 align:start position:0%
one reason being they feel that it is an
 
05:50:01.590 --> 05:50:01.600 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandate
 
05:50:03.750 --> 05:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
it says all police vehicles being used
 
05:50:05.670 --> 05:50:05.680 align:start position:0%
for a valid law enforcement function
 
05:50:07.430 --> 05:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
shall be fully marked with visible
 
05:50:10.548 --> 05:50:10.558 align:start position:0%
identifiers it goes on to talk about
 
05:50:13.590 --> 05:50:13.600 align:start position:0%
adding the agency's name and
 
05:50:15.350 --> 05:50:15.360 align:start position:0%
on the driver and passenger sides of the
 
05:50:17.590 --> 05:50:17.600 align:start position:0%
vehicle and just in my notes when we
 
05:50:19.910 --> 05:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
were talking about it they do feel that
 
05:50:19.920 --> 05:50:20.868 align:start position:0%
were talking about it they do feel that
if

05:50:20.868 --> 05:50:20.878 align:start position:0%
if
 
05:50:22.868 --> 05:50:22.878 align:start position:0%
a chief of police or an officer is in an
 
05:50:25.270 --> 05:50:25.280 align:start position:0%
undercover vehicle if they see something
 
05:50:26.788 --> 05:50:26.798 align:start position:0%
egregious in their job as they're
 
05:50:29.030 --> 05:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
traveling they do want that ability to
 
05:50:31.350 --> 05:50:31.360 align:start position:0%
be able to do their job
 
05:50:33.110 --> 05:50:33.120 align:start position:0%
in a day where they're having a hard
 
05:50:34.788 --> 05:50:34.798 align:start position:0%
time hiring and
 
05:50:37.990 --> 05:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
keeping officers it is an extra officer
 
05:50:39.990 --> 05:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
if they're going about their business
 
05:50:42.628 --> 05:50:42.638 align:start position:0%
and they see something that's egregious
 
05:50:44.628 --> 05:50:44.638 align:start position:0%
and the other thing um i was looking
 
05:50:46.948 --> 05:50:46.958 align:start position:0%
back in some testimony from last year
 
05:50:48.628 --> 05:50:48.638 align:start position:0%
chief obecky sent a letter to your
 
05:50:51.990 --> 05:50:52.000 align:start position:0%
committee in january of 2020 um
 
05:50:55.670 --> 05:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
addressing the incident of false pers um
 
05:50:56.830 --> 05:50:56.840 align:start position:0%
i'm going to say it wrong
 
05:50:56.840 --> 05:50:58.470 align:start position:0%
i'm going to say it wrong
personification

05:50:58.470 --> 05:50:58.480 align:start position:0%
personification
 
05:51:00.628 --> 05:51:00.638 align:start position:0%
he said he looked since he currently
 
05:51:03.030 --> 05:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
works for the hollis police department
 
05:51:04.788 --> 05:51:04.798 align:start position:0%
he did a search of his own records
 
05:51:07.030 --> 05:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
management system and he said looking
 
05:51:09.750 --> 05:51:09.760 align:start position:0%
back in 10 years during that time span
 
05:51:12.708 --> 05:51:12.718 align:start position:0%
he only found one incident of a report
 
05:51:14.868 --> 05:51:14.878 align:start position:0%
indicating false
 
05:51:17.830 --> 05:51:17.840 align:start position:0%
personification of a police officer
 
05:51:21.190 --> 05:51:21.200 align:start position:0%
and lastly in my notes just that
 
05:51:22.868 --> 05:51:22.878 align:start position:0%
they do oppose the bill they feel that
 
05:51:24.310 --> 05:51:24.320 align:start position:0%
it would limit their agency from
 
05:51:26.708 --> 05:51:26.718 align:start position:0%
utilizing the necessary and appropriate
 
05:51:29.030 --> 05:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
tools to keep our roadways safe
 
05:51:30.628 --> 05:51:30.638 align:start position:0%
and i'm not sure i'll be able to answer
 
05:51:32.310 --> 05:51:32.320 align:start position:0%
any questions but i'd be happy to take

i am in um support of the spill
 
05:52:25.350 --> 05:52:25.360 align:start position:0%
i feel that this bill helps protect our
 
05:52:28.070 --> 05:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
officers and our citizens
 
05:52:32.070 --> 05:52:32.080 align:start position:0%
i grew up in a time before cell phones
 
05:52:34.948 --> 05:52:34.958 align:start position:0%
i actually was almost a victim
 
05:52:38.390 --> 05:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
of someone pretending to be an officer
 
05:52:41.190 --> 05:52:41.200 align:start position:0%
and having the it looked exactly like a
 
05:52:43.270 --> 05:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
police vehicle unmarked police vehicle
 
05:52:45.110 --> 05:52:45.120 align:start position:0%
he had the light that you know you can
 
05:52:48.390 --> 05:52:48.400 align:start position:0%
put in the dashboard or whatever
 
05:52:51.750 --> 05:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
fortunately i was aware that there was
 
05:52:53.910 --> 05:52:53.920 align:start position:0%
not in our state but it was out of state
 
05:52:55.590 --> 05:52:55.600 align:start position:0%
that i had been made aware of it and he
 
05:52:57.110 --> 05:52:57.120 align:start position:0%
had come into the state of new hampshire
 
05:53:00.150 --> 05:53:00.160 align:start position:0%
because we are surrounded by a lot of um
 
05:53:02.230 --> 05:53:02.240 align:start position:0%
you know a lot of other states
 
05:53:04.070 --> 05:53:04.080 align:start position:0%
this person had come in he was
 
05:53:07.110 --> 05:53:07.120 align:start position:0%
representing um as he was
 
05:53:09.590 --> 05:53:09.600 align:start position:0%
came up to my car as a police officer
 
05:53:12.070 --> 05:53:12.080 align:start position:0%
fully clothed full police
 
05:53:14.628 --> 05:53:14.638 align:start position:0%
everything um but because i had heard
 
05:53:16.868 --> 05:53:16.878 align:start position:0%
that there was a rapist um
 
05:53:19.750 --> 05:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
that was doing this in new york i chose
 
05:53:21.350 --> 05:53:21.360 align:start position:0%
not to um
 
05:53:23.830 --> 05:53:23.840 align:start position:0%
not to give not to open my door he told
 
05:53:26.310 --> 05:53:26.320 align:start position:0%
me to get out i refused
 
05:53:27.830 --> 05:53:27.840 align:start position:0%
had i
 
05:53:27.840 --> 05:53:29.510 align:start position:0%
had i
followed

05:53:29.510 --> 05:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
followed
 
05:53:31.750 --> 05:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
what most law-abiding citizens would
 
05:53:33.910 --> 05:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
have done with an unmarked car
 
05:53:35.590 --> 05:53:35.600 align:start position:0%
i don't know that i'd be here today to
 
05:53:38.628 --> 05:53:38.638 align:start position:0%
talk to you folks because he also was
 
05:53:42.788 --> 05:53:42.798 align:start position:0%
eventually found guilty of murder
 
05:53:44.948 --> 05:53:44.958 align:start position:0%
so that being said in
 
05:53:47.030 --> 05:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
the era that we have now we have great
 
05:53:49.590 --> 05:53:49.600 align:start position:0%
technology we have great opportunities
 
05:53:52.310 --> 05:53:52.320 align:start position:0%
um we tell people you know if you if you
 
05:53:54.470 --> 05:53:54.480 align:start position:0%
are fearful drive to the closest police
 
05:53:56.788 --> 05:53:56.798 align:start position:0%
station the bottom line is is that's not
 
05:54:00.150 --> 05:54:00.160 align:start position:0%
always a reality um people's phones die
 
05:54:01.830 --> 05:54:01.840 align:start position:0%
uh there's a lot of things that can go
 
05:54:05.110 --> 05:54:05.120 align:start position:0%
wrong the other thing is is that
 
05:54:07.830 --> 05:54:07.840 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of situations that i feel
 
05:54:10.310 --> 05:54:10.320 align:start position:0%
that having the police officers marked
 
05:54:13.270 --> 05:54:13.280 align:start position:0%
the the officers cars that are being
 
05:54:15.450 --> 05:54:15.460 align:start position:0%
used for regular um
 
05:54:15.460 --> 05:54:17.190 align:start position:0%
used for regular um
[Music]

05:54:17.190 --> 05:54:17.200 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:54:17.200 --> 05:54:18.310 align:start position:0%
[Music]
regular

05:54:18.310 --> 05:54:18.320 align:start position:0%
regular
 
05:54:18.320 --> 05:54:19.590 align:start position:0%
regular
citizen

05:54:19.590 --> 05:54:19.600 align:start position:0%
citizen
 
05:54:21.670 --> 05:54:21.680 align:start position:0%
type of things not undercover not
 
05:54:23.350 --> 05:54:23.360 align:start position:0%
detectives not
 
05:54:23.360 --> 05:54:24.548 align:start position:0%
detectives not
corrections

05:54:24.548 --> 05:54:24.558 align:start position:0%
corrections
 
05:54:26.548 --> 05:54:26.558 align:start position:0%
um but i think it's important that they
 
05:54:30.150 --> 05:54:30.160 align:start position:0%
are identified um especially times right
 
05:54:32.390 --> 05:54:32.400 align:start position:0%
now with the way things are everybody is
 
05:54:34.788 --> 05:54:34.798 align:start position:0%
so worried about what is going on and
 
05:54:38.070 --> 05:54:38.080 align:start position:0%
what everyone else is doing if we see a
 
05:54:40.470 --> 05:54:40.480 align:start position:0%
what looks like a police officer
 
05:54:42.788 --> 05:54:42.798 align:start position:0%
a police office vehicle but they're in
 
05:54:44.948 --> 05:54:44.958 align:start position:0%
plain clothes
 
05:54:47.990 --> 05:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
and they don't have any way to know
 
05:54:50.230 --> 05:54:50.240 align:start position:0%
as a citizen do we really know that
 
05:54:51.910 --> 05:54:51.920 align:start position:0%
they're an officer
 
05:54:53.750 --> 05:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
should we really be going up to them and
 
05:54:56.150 --> 05:54:56.160 align:start position:0%
trying to help them in whatever you know
 
05:54:59.110 --> 05:54:59.120 align:start position:0%
if they say get out of here or they say
 
05:55:01.430 --> 05:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
you know do this or whatever should we
 
05:55:03.510 --> 05:55:03.520 align:start position:0%
automatically just blindly follow
 
05:55:07.110 --> 05:55:07.120 align:start position:0%
whatever this this person in an unmarked
 
05:55:10.390 --> 05:55:10.400 align:start position:0%
undercover car is telling us to do
 
05:55:12.548 --> 05:55:12.558 align:start position:0%
i have significant problems with the
 
05:55:14.470 --> 05:55:14.480 align:start position:0%
ghost plates
 
05:55:17.750 --> 05:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
and in closing i would like to say that
 
05:55:20.788 --> 05:55:20.798 align:start position:0%
i think transparency is really important
 
05:55:22.628 --> 05:55:22.638 align:start position:0%
especially right now with what's going
 
05:55:25.430 --> 05:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
on in our state and our country i think
 
05:55:27.750 --> 05:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
it's even more important for our police
 
05:55:30.868 --> 05:55:30.878 align:start position:0%
officers and to be given the opportunity
 
05:55:32.788 --> 05:55:32.798 align:start position:0%
to be as transparent as possible and i
 
05:55:37.270 --> 05:55:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:38.628 --> 05:55:38.638 align:start position:0%

those cruisers are primari their primary
 
05:56:58.150 --> 05:56:58.160 align:start position:0%
responsibility is a traffic enforcement
 
05:56:59.910 --> 05:56:59.920 align:start position:0%
they're assigned to various geographical
 
05:57:01.430 --> 05:57:01.440 align:start position:0%
regions throughout the state and they're
 
05:57:02.708 --> 05:57:02.718 align:start position:0%

sets of plates they're issued passenger
 
05:57:45.990 --> 05:57:46.000 align:start position:0%

05:58:00.628 --> 05:58:00.638 align:start position:0%
up a little bit
 
05:58:01.830 --> 05:58:01.840 align:start position:0%
you know you know
 
05:58:04.788 --> 05:58:04.798 align:start position:0%
we employ those 115 cruisers those
 
05:58:06.948 --> 05:58:06.958 align:start position:0%
troopers that those administrative staff
 
05:58:09.670 --> 05:58:09.680 align:start position:0%
are detectives we employ those troopers
 
05:58:11.590 --> 05:58:11.600 align:start position:0%
in additional responsibilities
 
05:58:13.430 --> 05:58:13.440 align:start position:0%
throughout different time periods of the
 
05:58:16.150 --> 05:58:16.160 align:start position:0%
year so for instance you know
 
05:58:18.070 --> 05:58:18.080 align:start position:0%
new year's eve we'll ask those
 
05:58:20.070 --> 05:58:20.080 align:start position:0%
detectives those administrative staff if
 
05:58:22.628 --> 05:58:22.638 align:start position:0%
they can bolster our patrol numbers if
 
05:58:24.708 --> 05:58:24.718 align:start position:0%
they can come out and help
 
05:58:26.628 --> 05:58:26.638 align:start position:0%
and patrol the roadway so when you see
 
05:58:28.310 --> 05:58:28.320 align:start position:0%
on the news that the state police is out
 
05:58:30.548 --> 05:58:30.558 align:start position:0%
in full force that's true because we're
 
05:58:32.470 --> 05:58:32.480 align:start position:0%
utilizing our detectives and our
 
05:58:34.788 --> 05:58:34.798 align:start position:0%
administrative staff to come out and
 
05:58:37.670 --> 05:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
supplement our uniform division now when
 
05:58:40.628 --> 05:58:40.638 align:start position:0%
they do that they're doing it in their
 
05:58:42.628 --> 05:58:42.638 align:start position:0%
unmarked cruiser they're doing it in
 
05:58:45.910 --> 05:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
their silver or black car that has 360
 
05:58:48.070 --> 05:58:48.080 align:start position:0%
degree lighting but at that point per
 
05:58:51.270 --> 05:58:51.280 align:start position:0%
our policy we make them put on their
 
05:58:53.830 --> 05:58:53.840 align:start position:0%
state police license plate so it's not
 
05:58:55.750 --> 05:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
your typical passenger plate so they'll
 
05:58:57.510 --> 05:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
put on that state police license plate
 
05:58:58.948 --> 05:58:58.958 align:start position:0%
and they'll go out they'll perform
 
05:59:02.868 --> 05:59:02.878 align:start position:0%
traffic duties patrol duties dwi
 
05:59:05.030 --> 05:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
duties they'll assist hampton beach at
 
05:59:06.868 --> 05:59:06.878 align:start position:0%
certain times hampton pd
 
05:59:09.270 --> 05:59:09.280 align:start position:0%
or the nascar races just just to name a
 
05:59:12.390 --> 05:59:12.400 align:start position:0%
few so we we do utilize those cruisers
 
05:59:14.470 --> 05:59:14.480 align:start position:0%
they're very important to us to bolster
 
05:59:16.708 --> 05:59:16.718 align:start position:0%
our numbers for public safety
 
05:59:18.868 --> 05:59:18.878 align:start position:0%
however as this bill is written now
 
05:59:21.670 --> 05:59:21.680 align:start position:0%
those cruisers do not fall
 
05:59:24.070 --> 05:59:24.080 align:start position:0%
under the way it's written however we in
 
05:59:25.430 --> 05:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
the state police would be willing to
 
05:59:27.990 --> 05:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
work with the sponsor to perhaps come up
 
05:59:30.390 --> 05:59:30.400 align:start position:0%
with an amendment to this to where we
 
05:59:30.400 --> 05:59:31.670 align:start position:0%
with an amendment to this to where we
could

05:59:31.670 --> 05:59:31.680 align:start position:0%
could
 
05:59:34.230 --> 05:59:34.240 align:start position:0%
utilize our administrative vehicles our
 
05:59:35.830 --> 05:59:35.840 align:start position:0%
unmarked vehicles in their current
 
05:59:37.830 --> 05:59:37.840 align:start position:0%
capacity um
 
05:59:40.548 --> 05:59:40.558 align:start position:0%
but making sure as we already do that we
 
05:59:43.030 --> 05:59:43.040 align:start position:0%
do a dog or doing those license plates
 
05:59:45.350 --> 05:59:45.360 align:start position:0%
when necessary so that they're marked
 
05:59:47.270 --> 05:59:47.280 align:start position:0%
because if we didn't if we did have to
 
05:59:49.430 --> 05:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
uh abide by this as you can see there
 
05:59:51.590 --> 05:59:51.600 align:start position:0%
would be a cost to it
 
05:59:54.788 --> 05:59:54.798 align:start position:0%
moving forward and but we're certainly
 
05:59:56.390 --> 05:59:56.400 align:start position:0%
more than happy to work with the sponsor
 
05:59:58.868 --> 05:59:58.878 align:start position:0%
in that and what i will say uh to those
 
06:00:00.868 --> 06:00:00.878 align:start position:0%
ghost plates because i actually have one
 
06:00:02.628 --> 06:00:02.638 align:start position:0%
i have a black cruiser i'm issued a
 
06:00:04.390 --> 06:00:04.400 align:start position:0%
state police license plate says state
 
06:00:06.070 --> 06:00:06.080 align:start position:0%
police car four
 
06:00:08.390 --> 06:00:08.400 align:start position:0%
but i also have a passenger plate number
 
06:00:10.310 --> 06:00:10.320 align:start position:0%
if you run that passenger plate number
 
06:00:12.070 --> 06:00:12.080 align:start position:0%
if a local police department runs that
 
06:00:13.750 --> 06:00:13.760 align:start position:0%
number it comes back to the new
 
06:00:14.948 --> 06:00:14.958 align:start position:0%
hampshire state police so the new
 
06:00:17.110 --> 06:00:17.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire state police does
 
06:00:19.830 --> 06:00:19.840 align:start position:0%
with the exception of our narcotics unit
 
06:00:22.310 --> 06:00:22.320 align:start position:0%
they do those plates do come back to the
 
06:00:24.868 --> 06:00:24.878 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire so with that i'd
 
06:00:27.030 --> 06:00:27.040 align:start position:0%
be more than happy to take any questions
 
06:00:29.270 --> 06:00:29.280 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
06:00:31.030 --> 06:00:31.040 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna i have to ask one before i
 
06:00:32.470 --> 06:00:32.480 align:start position:0%
open it up to the committee
 
06:00:34.070 --> 06:00:34.080 align:start position:0%
i understand everything you've said
 
06:00:36.470 --> 06:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
except the you did not mention why you
 
06:00:39.750 --> 06:00:39.760 align:start position:0%
even need the passenger plates
 
06:00:41.030 --> 06:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
if you're changing them half the time
 
06:00:42.390 --> 06:00:42.400 align:start position:0%
when they're assisting in the regular
 
06:00:45.830 --> 06:00:45.840 align:start position:0%
course of duties but i get that but why
 
06:00:47.590 --> 06:00:47.600 align:start position:0%
bother changing them why except for
 
06:00:49.590 --> 06:00:49.600 align:start position:0%
narcotics i understand that one too that
 
06:00:51.830 --> 06:00:51.840 align:start position:0%
would be the ghost plates in question
 
06:00:54.150 --> 06:00:54.160 align:start position:0%
why do the rest of the cruisers that are
 
06:00:56.788 --> 06:00:56.798 align:start position:0%
issued two sets one passenger need them
 
06:00:58.230 --> 06:00:58.240 align:start position:0%
and that's a great question thank you
 
06:01:01.110 --> 06:01:01.120 align:start position:0%
for that so the majority of those 115
 
06:01:03.670 --> 06:01:03.680 align:start position:0%
cruisers are our detective bureaus so
 
06:01:05.910 --> 06:01:05.920 align:start position:0%
they conduct sensitive
 
06:01:08.788 --> 06:01:08.798 align:start position:0%
investigations uh they
 
06:01:10.470 --> 06:01:10.480 align:start position:0%
they do a lot of follow-up interviews
 
06:01:13.830 --> 06:01:13.840 align:start position:0%
that require going to residences that
 
06:01:16.548 --> 06:01:16.558 align:start position:0%
of sensitive natures homicides
 
06:01:18.548 --> 06:01:18.558 align:start position:0%
sexual assaults all
 
06:01:20.948 --> 06:01:20.958 align:start position:0%
all types of investigations and what we
 
06:01:23.190 --> 06:01:23.200 align:start position:0%
typically find is when we show up in an
 
06:01:26.470 --> 06:01:26.480 align:start position:0%
unmarked car with regular license plate
 
06:01:28.390 --> 06:01:28.400 align:start position:0%
it kind of it puts the victim
 
06:01:31.750 --> 06:01:31.760 align:start position:0%
if you will more at ease uh
 
06:01:33.670 --> 06:01:33.680 align:start position:0%
more often than not so a lot of the
 
06:01:36.070 --> 06:01:36.080 align:start position:0%
times we utilize that to tone down our
 
06:01:38.230 --> 06:01:38.240 align:start position:0%
appearance which is exactly why
 
06:01:40.948 --> 06:01:40.958 align:start position:0%
those troopers those detectives are not
 
06:01:42.628 --> 06:01:42.638 align:start position:0%
in a state police uniform they're
 
06:01:45.430 --> 06:01:45.440 align:start position:0%
dressed the way i am today
 
06:01:47.510 --> 06:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
i'm going to grab myself a follow-up
 
06:01:49.670 --> 06:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
i think i can do this
 
06:01:49.680 --> 06:01:50.948 align:start position:0%
i think i can do this
um

06:01:50.948 --> 06:01:50.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:01:53.270 --> 06:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
so you're saying the only ones that are
 
06:01:54.470 --> 06:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
not really
 
06:01:56.788 --> 06:01:56.798 align:start position:0%
our ghost plates that don't that don't
 
06:01:59.350 --> 06:01:59.360 align:start position:0%
uh come up as new hampshire state police
 
06:02:02.070 --> 06:02:02.080 align:start position:0%
plates are narcotics corrupt but all the
 
06:02:03.270 --> 06:02:03.280 align:start position:0%
other ones do
 
06:02:05.750 --> 06:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
show up as when when called in new
 
06:02:07.350 --> 06:02:07.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire state police that's correct
 
06:02:09.190 --> 06:02:09.200 align:start position:0%
and we actually have the registrations
 
06:02:11.750 --> 06:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
that are in our cruiser issued by the
 
06:02:14.628 --> 06:02:14.638 align:start position:0%
dmv director that come back to the state
 
06:02:16.310 --> 06:02:16.320 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire all right thank you
 
06:02:18.470 --> 06:02:18.480 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
06:02:21.670 --> 06:02:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:23.990 --> 06:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
correct me if i'm wrong if if you're
 
06:02:25.750 --> 06:02:25.760 align:start position:0%
stopped by
 
06:02:29.030 --> 06:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
someone you in an unmarked car with a
 
06:02:31.110 --> 06:02:31.120 align:start position:0%
spotlight on the door
 
06:02:33.510 --> 06:02:33.520 align:start position:0%
that presents themselves with a police
 
06:02:35.270 --> 06:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
officer and you
 
06:02:37.190 --> 06:02:37.200 align:start position:0%
are skeptical of that particularly with
 
06:02:37.200 --> 06:02:38.548 align:start position:0%
are skeptical of that particularly with
women

06:02:38.548 --> 06:02:38.558 align:start position:0%
women
 
06:02:39.750 --> 06:02:39.760 align:start position:0%
is there
 
06:02:42.230 --> 06:02:42.240 align:start position:0%
an rsa that allows them to
 
06:02:43.910 --> 06:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
let the police officer know that they're
 
06:02:45.350 --> 06:02:45.360 align:start position:0%
going to drive to the
 
06:02:48.788 --> 06:02:48.798 align:start position:0%
nearest police station or somewhere safe
 
06:02:48.798 --> 06:02:51.270 align:start position:0%
nearest police station or somewhere safe
and

06:02:51.270 --> 06:02:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:52.868 --> 06:02:52.878 align:start position:0%
so they can be assured that it is a
 
06:02:54.310 --> 06:02:54.320 align:start position:0%
police officer
 
06:02:55.830 --> 06:02:55.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question and i can
 
06:02:57.430 --> 06:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
tell you that that is part of state
 
06:03:00.788 --> 06:03:00.798 align:start position:0%
police policy if in fact somebody feels
 
06:03:03.190 --> 06:03:03.200 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable then if and they want to
 
06:03:05.430 --> 06:03:05.440 align:start position:0%
travel to a nearest lighted area or the
 
06:03:07.430 --> 06:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
nearest police department we will
 
06:03:09.350 --> 06:03:09.360 align:start position:0%
accommodate that and we have to abide by
 
06:03:12.070 --> 06:03:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:13.030 --> 06:03:13.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:03:15.590 --> 06:03:15.600 align:start position:0%
for the questions representative gorski
 
06:03:17.190 --> 06:03:17.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
06:03:19.510 --> 06:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question um if i understand
 
06:03:21.990 --> 06:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
you correctly you mentioned the 115
 
06:03:24.390 --> 06:03:24.400 align:start position:0%
cruises that are not marked
 
06:03:26.150 --> 06:03:26.160 align:start position:0%
they do some of these
 
06:03:26.160 --> 06:03:27.110 align:start position:0%
they do some of these
normal

06:03:27.110 --> 06:03:27.120 align:start position:0%
normal
 
06:03:29.270 --> 06:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
traffic normal police
 
06:03:31.030 --> 06:03:31.040 align:start position:0%
functions that the representative
 
06:03:33.190 --> 06:03:33.200 align:start position:0%
mentioned so it sounds like those would
 
06:03:35.990 --> 06:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
have to get marked if they're doing
 
06:03:37.670 --> 06:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
those type of functions
 
06:03:39.910 --> 06:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
and i guess my question goes at the
 
06:03:43.270 --> 06:03:43.280 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note of 318 000.
 
06:03:45.190 --> 06:03:45.200 align:start position:0%
who's on the coffers for that if those
 
06:03:48.470 --> 06:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
115 cruisers have to be
 
06:03:49.350 --> 06:03:49.360 align:start position:0%
you know
 
06:03:51.270 --> 06:03:51.280 align:start position:0%
marked and painted and all that good
 
06:03:52.548 --> 06:03:52.558 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question it would be
 
06:03:54.070 --> 06:03:54.080 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire when it would
 
06:03:55.750 --> 06:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
come out of the department of safety's
 
06:03:58.150 --> 06:03:58.160 align:start position:0%
budget for that
 
06:04:00.708 --> 06:04:00.718 align:start position:0%
representative o'hare
 
06:04:01.990 --> 06:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
thank you and just kind of actually a
 
06:04:03.830 --> 06:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
quick follow-up to that question
 
06:04:06.070 --> 06:04:06.080 align:start position:0%
if we're just asking for the decals
 
06:04:07.670 --> 06:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
it would bring the fiscal note down to i
 
06:04:09.110 --> 06:04:09.120 align:start position:0%
believe like thirteen thousand eight
 
06:04:10.868 --> 06:04:10.878 align:start position:0%
hundred if it's a hundred hundred and
 
06:04:12.310 --> 06:04:12.320 align:start position:0%
twenty dollars for decals
 
06:04:13.990 --> 06:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
so that hundred and twenty thank you for
 
06:04:15.830 --> 06:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
your question that hundred and dollars
 
06:04:17.110 --> 06:04:17.120 align:start position:0%
is for
 
06:04:19.190 --> 06:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
that was priced out for the permanent
 
06:04:21.830 --> 06:04:21.840 align:start position:0%
decals that are on the um that are on
 
06:04:24.470 --> 06:04:24.480 align:start position:0%
the cruisers we have in the past tried
 
06:04:28.230 --> 06:04:28.240 align:start position:0%
to issue out magnetic decals to our uh
 
06:04:30.868 --> 06:04:30.878 align:start position:0%
to our unmarked cruisers for instance if
 
06:04:32.708 --> 06:04:32.718 align:start position:0%
they deci if the trooper who's a
 
06:04:34.948 --> 06:04:34.958 align:start position:0%
detective decides to work an overnight
 
06:04:38.070 --> 06:04:38.080 align:start position:0%
paving detail out on 93 we had them put
 
06:04:39.830 --> 06:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
on their state police license plate as
 
06:04:42.230 --> 06:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
well as magnetic decals however what we
 
06:04:46.948 --> 06:04:46.958 align:start position:0%
found was the decals weren't holding on
 
06:04:48.708 --> 06:04:48.718 align:start position:0%
when they were operating the vehicle and
 
06:04:50.788 --> 06:04:50.798 align:start position:0%
they would peel off and and we would
 
06:04:52.070 --> 06:04:52.080 align:start position:0%
lose them and they would end up in the
 
06:04:54.390 --> 06:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
wrong hands
 
06:04:55.670 --> 06:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
06:04:57.430 --> 06:04:57.440 align:start position:0%
representative fenton

thank you for being here and thank you
 
06:04:59.990 --> 06:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
for taking my question and brad might be
 
06:05:01.270 --> 06:05:01.280 align:start position:0%
able to help us with this question as
 
06:05:03.270 --> 06:05:03.280 align:start position:0%
well do you know if there are any any
 
06:05:05.750 --> 06:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
states that currently do not um that
 
06:05:07.270 --> 06:05:07.280 align:start position:0%
have to have all their police vehicles
 
06:05:07.280 --> 06:05:08.708 align:start position:0%
have to have all their police vehicles
marked

06:05:08.708 --> 06:05:08.718 align:start position:0%
marked
 
06:05:10.150 --> 06:05:10.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question and i
 
06:05:15.990 --> 06:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:17.910 --> 06:05:17.920 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee uh
 
06:05:20.070 --> 06:05:20.080 align:start position:0%
first times for uh i'll get back to the
 
06:05:23.350 --> 06:05:23.360 align:start position:0%
second round representative tylerski
 
06:05:25.030 --> 06:05:25.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question can you
 
06:05:27.350 --> 06:05:27.360 align:start position:0%
speak to the issue of um
 
06:05:29.430 --> 06:05:29.440 align:start position:0%
officer impersonation and if you are
 
06:05:30.868 --> 06:05:30.878 align:start position:0%
aware of
 
06:05:33.990 --> 06:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
any um across the state in recent time i
 
06:05:36.788 --> 06:05:36.798 align:start position:0%
know we we got the reminder from um
 
06:05:39.350 --> 06:05:39.360 align:start position:0%
the chief from hollis last time said he
 
06:05:40.548 --> 06:05:40.558 align:start position:0%
knew of one
 
06:05:40.558 --> 06:05:41.510 align:start position:0%
knew of one
but

06:05:41.510 --> 06:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:05:43.190 --> 06:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
is that a problem
 
06:05:45.270 --> 06:05:45.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question and and i i
 
06:05:47.750 --> 06:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
do know of two instances
 
06:05:51.270 --> 06:05:51.280 align:start position:0%
uh we're out on interstate 93 and route
 
06:05:53.750 --> 06:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
393 in concord because i was the
 
06:05:56.310 --> 06:05:56.320 align:start position:0%
lieutenant of troop d in concord where
 
06:05:58.310 --> 06:05:58.320 align:start position:0%
we did have uh
 
06:06:00.548 --> 06:06:00.558 align:start position:0%
officer impersonations on on two
 
06:06:02.390 --> 06:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
separate occasions and that was probably
 
06:06:05.590 --> 06:06:05.600 align:start position:0%
within the last five years
 
06:06:06.868 --> 06:06:06.878 align:start position:0%
thank you can i have a one quick
 
06:06:08.390 --> 06:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up thank you
 
06:06:10.470 --> 06:06:10.480 align:start position:0%
um the other issue that i'm just sort of
 
06:06:12.230 --> 06:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
struggling with is
 
06:06:13.510 --> 06:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
i guess
 
06:06:15.350 --> 06:06:15.360 align:start position:0%
if we're if this bill
 
06:06:16.948 --> 06:06:16.958 align:start position:0%
does go through there are exceptions
 
06:06:19.430 --> 06:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
here i think i'm reading this correctly
 
06:06:21.830 --> 06:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
that um it does not apply to police
 
06:06:23.670 --> 06:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
vehicles being used primarily for law
 
06:06:25.590 --> 06:06:25.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement functions
 
06:06:27.990 --> 06:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
involving and then it lists a number
 
06:06:28.868 --> 06:06:28.878 align:start position:0%
do you
 
06:06:30.948 --> 06:06:30.958 align:start position:0%
believe that wording is sufficient for
 
06:06:33.190 --> 06:06:33.200 align:start position:0%
you to still be able to handle what you
 
06:06:34.788 --> 06:06:34.798 align:start position:0%
need to do
 
06:06:34.798 --> 06:06:35.750 align:start position:0%
need to do
or

06:06:35.750 --> 06:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
or
 
06:06:38.070 --> 06:06:38.080 align:start position:0%
does it need more clarification thank
 
06:06:39.750 --> 06:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
you for your question we would like to
 
06:06:41.350 --> 06:06:41.360 align:start position:0%
work with the sponsor for more
 
06:06:43.990 --> 06:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
clarification and the only reason being
 
06:06:46.390 --> 06:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
our sticking point is because we do use
 
06:06:50.150 --> 06:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
those 115 other vehicles for what you
 
06:06:52.070 --> 06:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
would consider normal police functions
 
06:06:54.470 --> 06:06:54.480 align:start position:0%
at various times throughout the year
 
06:06:56.230 --> 06:06:56.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:06:57.510 --> 06:06:57.520 align:start position:0%
any more questions from the committee
 
06:06:59.030 --> 06:06:59.040 align:start position:0%
representative hill
 
06:07:00.470 --> 06:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
06:07:03.270 --> 06:07:03.280 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
06:07:06.230 --> 06:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
following up on the impersonation uh
 
06:07:09.270 --> 06:07:09.280 align:start position:0%
line of questioning earth or thoughts
 
06:07:12.708 --> 06:07:12.718 align:start position:0%
uh are there any uh suggestions from
 
06:07:14.788 --> 06:07:14.798 align:start position:0%
across the country of of ways of
 
06:07:16.868 --> 06:07:16.878 align:start position:0%
handling it other than
 
06:07:16.878 --> 06:07:17.750 align:start position:0%
handling it other than
that

06:07:17.750 --> 06:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:07:20.150 --> 06:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
driving to a lighted area or something
 
06:07:22.150 --> 06:07:22.160 align:start position:0%
like that is there any way to
 
06:07:22.160 --> 06:07:22.868 align:start position:0%
like that is there any way to
to

06:07:22.868 --> 06:07:22.878 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:07:25.670 --> 06:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
mark a cruiser
 
06:07:25.680 --> 06:07:26.470 align:start position:0%
mark a cruiser
or

06:07:26.470 --> 06:07:26.480 align:start position:0%
or
 
06:07:29.270 --> 06:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
or have some technology
 
06:07:32.390 --> 06:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
available that would identify a police
 
06:07:35.910 --> 06:07:35.920 align:start position:0%
officer or a cruiser as a police officer
 
06:07:35.920 --> 06:07:38.310 align:start position:0%
officer or a cruiser as a police officer
vehicle

06:07:38.310 --> 06:07:38.320 align:start position:0%
vehicle
 
06:07:40.230 --> 06:07:40.240 align:start position:0%
i don't know thank you for your question
 
06:07:41.830 --> 06:07:41.840 align:start position:0%
i don't know of any additional
 
06:07:45.270 --> 06:07:45.280 align:start position:0%
technology other than i do know that our
 
06:07:47.110 --> 06:07:47.120 align:start position:0%
new hampshire police standards and
 
06:07:47.120 --> 06:07:48.788 align:start position:0%
new hampshire police standards and
training

06:07:48.788 --> 06:07:48.798 align:start position:0%
training
 
06:07:51.350 --> 06:07:51.360 align:start position:0%
and through our police departments in
 
06:07:52.948 --> 06:07:52.958 align:start position:0%
this state
 
06:07:56.628 --> 06:07:56.638 align:start position:0%
train on this issue in in because we do
 
06:07:59.110 --> 06:07:59.120 align:start position:0%
we do have police officers that are that
 
06:08:01.110 --> 06:08:01.120 align:start position:0%
are driving unmarked cruisers that are
 
06:08:03.510 --> 06:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
dressed just like i am and they are
 
06:08:06.230 --> 06:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
trained how to identify themselves for
 
06:08:08.948 --> 06:08:08.958 align:start position:0%
instance i have a badge i have a id in
 
06:08:12.708 --> 06:08:12.718 align:start position:0%
my wallet i have a sidearm obviously
 
06:08:12.718 --> 06:08:13.670 align:start position:0%
my wallet i have a sidearm obviously
and

06:08:13.670 --> 06:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:08:15.430 --> 06:08:15.440 align:start position:0%
we are very
 
06:08:18.310 --> 06:08:18.320 align:start position:0%
keen to that issue which is why
 
06:08:20.310 --> 06:08:20.320 align:start position:0%
it is the
 
06:08:24.070 --> 06:08:24.080 align:start position:0%
it is pushed to be aware of that every
 
06:08:25.910 --> 06:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
time you're stopping a car so for
 
06:08:27.750 --> 06:08:27.760 align:start position:0%
instance i live in beau
 
06:08:30.390 --> 06:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
i travel to hazen drive every day
 
06:08:33.350 --> 06:08:33.360 align:start position:0%
i travel on interstate 89 to 93 to route
 
06:08:35.190 --> 06:08:35.200 align:start position:0%
393 i have the opportunity to come
 
06:08:37.830 --> 06:08:37.840 align:start position:0%
across numerous vehicles doing all sorts
 
06:08:40.070 --> 06:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
of different things and i do take
 
06:08:42.868 --> 06:08:42.878 align:start position:0%
enforcement action uh more often than
 
06:08:44.628 --> 06:08:44.638 align:start position:0%
not i'm dressed in a uniform but for
 
06:08:47.110 --> 06:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
those times that i'm not i'm like this
 
06:08:49.110 --> 06:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
and i go out of my way
 
06:08:49.120 --> 06:08:50.230 align:start position:0%
and i go out of my way
to

06:08:50.230 --> 06:08:50.240 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:08:52.628 --> 06:08:52.638 align:start position:0%
identify who i am through an
 
06:08:55.910 --> 06:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
identification through my badge and
 
06:08:57.910 --> 06:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
assess the situation if there's at any
 
06:09:00.310 --> 06:09:00.320 align:start position:0%
point any concerns
 
06:09:03.110 --> 06:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
i would as we mentioned earlier we would
 
06:09:05.270 --> 06:09:05.280 align:start position:0%
suggest going to you could follow me to
 
06:09:06.470 --> 06:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
state police headquarters you could
 
06:09:08.390 --> 06:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
follow me to concord police department
 
06:09:10.390 --> 06:09:10.400 align:start position:0%
wherever really would make that person
 
06:09:12.628 --> 06:09:12.638 align:start position:0%
feel comfortable but i apologize i don't
 
06:09:15.110 --> 06:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
know of any additional technology that
 
06:09:17.270 --> 06:09:17.280 align:start position:0%
thank you could fix that
 
06:09:19.350 --> 06:09:19.360 align:start position:0%
um anybody else who hasn't had a
 
06:09:20.628 --> 06:09:20.638 align:start position:0%
question yet

chairman thank you for taking my
question

06:09:24.708 --> 06:09:24.718 align:start position:0%
question

are they all marked with all the blue
 
06:09:41.510 --> 06:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
lights and the grill and all over so
 
06:09:43.670 --> 06:09:43.680 align:start position:0%

degree lighting requirement that i
 
06:09:54.628 --> 06:09:54.638 align:start position:0%
believe was set forth by dot several
 
06:09:56.548 --> 06:09:56.558 align:start position:0%
years back
 
06:09:59.110 --> 06:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
they have lights in the grill they have
 
06:09:59.120 --> 06:10:00.390 align:start position:0%
they have lights in the grill they have
lights

06:10:00.390 --> 06:10:00.400 align:start position:0%

underneath the headboard
 
06:10:05.190 --> 06:10:05.200 align:start position:0%
on the windshield they have lights in
 
06:10:07.750 --> 06:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
the rear dash as well as what we've just
 
06:10:09.590 --> 06:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
put in in the probably last five or six
 
06:10:11.910 --> 06:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
years lights on the
 
06:10:14.788 --> 06:10:14.798 align:start position:0%
passenger side and driver's side mirrors
 
06:10:16.070 --> 06:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
so that we can
 
06:10:19.190 --> 06:10:19.200 align:start position:0%
encompass that 360
 
06:10:20.470 --> 06:10:20.480 align:start position:0%
hello and i degrees know if anybody can
 
06:10:24.150 --> 06:10:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:26.390 --> 06:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
so my follow-up question would be that's
 
06:10:29.110 --> 06:10:29.120 align:start position:0%
a very expensive um
 
06:10:31.830 --> 06:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
technology to put into an automobile is
 
06:10:34.470 --> 06:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
it not would it would someone who wanted
 
06:10:37.910 --> 06:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
to portray being a a police officer who
 
06:10:39.190 --> 06:10:39.200 align:start position:0%
really wasn't
 
06:10:40.150 --> 06:10:40.160 align:start position:0%
would they
 
06:10:43.270 --> 06:10:43.280 align:start position:0%
would that be an easy thing for them to
 
06:10:46.548 --> 06:10:46.558 align:start position:0%
acquire or to do to a vehicle
 
06:10:48.150 --> 06:10:48.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for your follow-up i know i
 
06:10:51.190 --> 06:10:51.200 align:start position:0%
know for us it's between the uh price
 
06:10:53.190 --> 06:10:53.200 align:start position:0%
tag of two to three thousand dollars to
 
06:10:56.548 --> 06:10:56.558 align:start position:0%
outfit our cruisers in uh 360 degree
 
06:10:58.548 --> 06:10:58.558 align:start position:0%
lighting um so that would be a
 
06:11:00.230 --> 06:11:00.240 align:start position:0%
significant in my opinion that would be
 
06:11:04.310 --> 06:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
a significant expense for somebody
 
06:11:06.230 --> 06:11:06.240 align:start position:0%
um anybody else who hasn't asked a
 
06:11:08.470 --> 06:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
question yet first round seeing none
 
06:11:10.470 --> 06:11:10.480 align:start position:0%
representative o'hara
 
06:11:12.470 --> 06:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
thank you i promise my last question
 
06:11:14.788 --> 06:11:14.798 align:start position:0%
um i just thought about when mixing his
 
06:11:17.430 --> 06:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
thoughts with when representing charity
 
06:11:18.708 --> 06:11:18.718 align:start position:0%
talked about the blue lights in maine
 
06:11:21.110 --> 06:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
what's your thoughts on running the
 
06:11:22.628 --> 06:11:22.638 align:start position:0%
solid blue light
 
06:11:24.310 --> 06:11:24.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for your follow-up i can
 
06:11:26.230 --> 06:11:26.240 align:start position:0%
specifically speak to that because we do
 
06:11:29.270 --> 06:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
have the option in our police cruisers
 
06:11:31.190 --> 06:11:31.200 align:start position:0%
to have a cruise option where you hit
 
06:11:34.628 --> 06:11:34.638 align:start position:0%
the button and the blue lights stay
 
06:11:37.270 --> 06:11:37.280 align:start position:0%
on blue constant they don't flash they
 
06:11:39.750 --> 06:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
just stay blue
 
06:11:42.390 --> 06:11:42.400 align:start position:0%
what i have found and and we'll often
 
06:11:44.628 --> 06:11:44.638 align:start position:0%
utilize those during oversized load
 
06:11:47.990 --> 06:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
escorts and stuff but what i've found
 
06:11:49.750 --> 06:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
we typically will employ that during
 
06:11:52.628 --> 06:11:52.638 align:start position:0%
snow storms because it will
 
06:11:54.628 --> 06:11:54.638 align:start position:0%
get people to slow down
 
06:11:55.830 --> 06:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
quite frankly
 
06:11:58.070 --> 06:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
you know we'll patrol the highways we'll
 
06:11:59.750 --> 06:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
put on our cruise lights and they'll
 
06:12:03.030 --> 06:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
slow down under normal situations
 
06:12:04.628 --> 06:12:04.638 align:start position:0%
and again this is my opinion what
 
06:12:04.638 --> 06:12:05.910 align:start position:0%
and again this is my opinion what
happens

06:12:05.910 --> 06:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
happens
 
06:12:08.708 --> 06:12:08.718 align:start position:0%
more often than not is that it causes
 
06:12:08.718 --> 06:12:10.150 align:start position:0%
more often than not is that it causes
confusion

06:12:10.150 --> 06:12:10.160 align:start position:0%
confusion
 
06:12:11.830 --> 06:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
people will start pulling over when they
 
06:12:13.590 --> 06:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily need to pull over
 
06:12:15.830 --> 06:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
because the blue lights are on um and
 
06:12:16.948 --> 06:12:16.958 align:start position:0%
they're just trying to do the right
 
06:12:18.788 --> 06:12:18.798 align:start position:0%
thing when it when when we're just doing
 
06:12:23.030 --> 06:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:24.868 --> 06:12:24.878 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
06:12:27.510 --> 06:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
representative thompson
 
06:12:29.510 --> 06:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
lieutenant um
 
06:12:29.520 --> 06:12:30.310 align:start position:0%
lieutenant um
i

06:12:30.310 --> 06:12:30.320 align:start position:0%
i
 
06:12:33.350 --> 06:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
do you have any awareness of what the
 
06:12:35.510 --> 06:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
local police and county police with
 
06:12:37.110 --> 06:12:37.120 align:start position:0%
their unmarked
 
06:12:39.510 --> 06:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
cruisers might total
 
06:12:41.510 --> 06:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
i apologize thank you for your follow-up
 
06:12:45.430 --> 06:12:45.440 align:start position:0%
question i i do not i do not know um
 
06:12:46.628 --> 06:12:46.638 align:start position:0%
unfortunately i don't know how many
 
06:12:48.390 --> 06:12:48.400 align:start position:0%
cruisers they have that that would fall
 
06:12:50.548 --> 06:12:50.558 align:start position:0%
under this category i can only speak to
 
06:12:53.270 --> 06:12:53.280 align:start position:0%
what we have okay thank you
 
06:12:54.470 --> 06:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions from the
 
06:12:54.480 --> 06:12:56.310 align:start position:0%

06:13:11.670 --> 06:13:11.680 align:start position:0%

um
 
06:13:51.990 --> 06:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
what i'm going to do
 
06:13:53.030 --> 06:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
i'm going to make just to make a small
 
06:13:55.350 --> 06:13:55.360 align:start position:0%
announcement about two of those bills
 
06:13:57.270 --> 06:13:57.280 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to open the public hearing
 
06:13:59.350 --> 06:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
and recess it so we can have a short
 
06:14:01.110 --> 06:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
work session on an amendment that you
 
06:14:03.110 --> 06:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
just received and then when we come out
 
06:14:05.590 --> 06:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
of the recess we'll open up the exact
 
06:14:07.830 --> 06:14:07.840 align:start position:0%
session again and we'll take it out of
 
06:14:09.830 --> 06:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
recess and finish up the other three so
 
06:14:11.430 --> 06:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
for the record if you're here for house
 
06:14:14.070 --> 06:14:14.080 align:start position:0%
bill 1100 uh as a courtesy and out of
 
06:14:16.390 --> 06:14:16.400 align:start position:0%
respect of my ranking member he notified
 
06:14:17.750 --> 06:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
me that he couldn't make it here today
 
06:14:19.350 --> 06:14:19.360 align:start position:0%
to defend his own bill after the
 
06:14:20.868 --> 06:14:20.878 align:start position:0%
schedule was done
 
06:14:22.390 --> 06:14:22.400 align:start position:0%
i couldn't change it but i don't have to
 
06:14:24.708 --> 06:14:24.718 align:start position:0%
take it up so we're not going to
 
06:14:27.270 --> 06:14:27.280 align:start position:0%
for similar reasons house bill 1208 same
 
06:14:28.708 --> 06:14:28.718 align:start position:0%
thing we will not be taking that up
 
06:14:30.868 --> 06:14:30.878 align:start position:0%
today either so if any of you are here
 
06:14:33.110 --> 06:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
to see the exact executive session on
 
06:14:35.750 --> 06:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
those i apologize for the change uh but
 
06:14:38.548 --> 06:14:38.558 align:start position:0%
look at next week's calendar uh they are
 
06:14:38.558 --> 06:14:39.510 align:start position:0%
look at next week's calendar uh they are
both

06:14:39.510 --> 06:14:39.520 align:start position:0%
both
 
06:14:42.230 --> 06:14:42.240 align:start position:0%
early i believe so we'll have we'll be
 
06:14:45.030 --> 06:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
making a decision on them next week
 
06:14:47.750 --> 06:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
uh so that being said if i can see the
 
06:14:49.830 --> 06:14:49.840 align:start position:0%
calendar for a second what's the first
 
06:14:51.830 --> 06:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
one on the exact list
 
06:14:54.510 --> 06:14:54.520 align:start position:0%
except for 1100.
 
06:14:54.520 --> 06:14:56.310 align:start position:0%
except for 1100.
uh

06:14:56.310 --> 06:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:14:56.320 --> 06:14:57.350 align:start position:0%
uh
okay

06:14:57.350 --> 06:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:15:02.390 --> 06:15:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:04.548 --> 06:15:04.558 align:start position:0%
so to keep it official according to
 
06:15:05.910 --> 06:15:05.920 align:start position:0%
the schedule
 
06:15:07.350 --> 06:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
i'm going to open up the executive
 
06:15:11.190 --> 06:15:11.200 align:start position:0%
session on house bill 1461
 
06:15:13.350 --> 06:15:13.360 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to recess the executive
 
06:15:17.910 --> 06:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:21.990 --> 06:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:24.390 --> 06:15:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:24.400 --> 06:15:26.150 align:start position:0%
 
so

06:15:26.150 --> 06:15:26.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:15:26.160 --> 06:15:27.110 align:start position:0%
so
so

06:15:27.110 --> 06:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:15:28.548 --> 06:15:28.558 align:start position:0%
what i want to do
 
06:15:29.990 --> 06:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
before we we can shut this down for
 
06:15:31.190 --> 06:15:31.200 align:start position:0%
about five minutes i don't think it'll
 
06:15:33.990 --> 06:15:34.000 align:start position:0%
take us more than 15. i'm i'm gonna
 
06:15:35.590 --> 06:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
we're gonna hold a work session on the
 
06:15:38.310 --> 06:15:38.320 align:start position:0%
amendment for 1461 to see if we're all
 
06:15:41.510 --> 06:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
on the same page with it if we're not uh
 
06:15:43.590 --> 06:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
we can then decide to move forward with
 
06:15:43.600 --> 06:15:44.230 align:start position:0%
we can then decide to move forward with
an

06:15:44.230 --> 06:15:44.240 align:start position:0%
an
 
06:15:45.990 --> 06:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
exec session or not
 
06:15:47.830 --> 06:15:47.840 align:start position:0%
so just give us five minutes to regroup
 
06:15:49.990 --> 06:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
here and uh we'll get into that work
 
06:15:51.670 --> 06:15:51.680 align:start position:0%

1461 in recess um i cannot do work
 
06:44:48.468 --> 06:44:48.478 align:start position:0%
sessions on a proposed amendment uh
 
06:44:50.708 --> 06:44:50.718 align:start position:0%
without being publicly noticed so we're
 
06:44:52.788 --> 06:44:52.798 align:start position:0%
not moving forward with that uh what we
 
06:44:54.230 --> 06:44:54.240 align:start position:0%
are going to do i'm going to take it out
 
06:44:56.070 --> 06:44:56.080 align:start position:0%
of recess
 
06:44:57.990 --> 06:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
and we're just going to take up the bill
 
06:45:00.548 --> 06:45:00.558 align:start position:0%
with the amendment in an old fashioned
 
06:45:03.830 --> 06:45:03.840 align:start position:0%
executive session and see where it lands
 
06:45:06.788 --> 06:45:06.798 align:start position:0%

2022-0283 h is there a second
 
06:46:28.150 --> 06:46:28.160 align:start position:0%

on the amendment
 
06:46:33.430 --> 06:46:33.440 align:start position:0%
give me just a minute to make sure no
 
06:46:37.510 --> 06:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
problem mr speaker mr mr speaker
 
06:46:41.750 --> 06:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:41.760 --> 06:46:44.868 align:start position:0%
 
anyway

06:46:44.868 --> 06:46:44.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:47.750 --> 06:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
we've all seen littering on the highway
 
06:46:47.760 --> 06:46:49.510 align:start position:0%
we've all seen littering on the highway
and

06:46:49.510 --> 06:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:46:51.350 --> 06:46:51.360 align:start position:0%
according to the testimony that was
 
06:46:52.628 --> 06:46:52.638 align:start position:0%
given to us
 
06:46:54.708 --> 06:46:54.718 align:start position:0%
it i think the first offense was
 
06:46:56.270 --> 06:46:56.280 align:start position:0%
something like 60 some odd
 
06:46:56.280 --> 06:46:57.750 align:start position:0%
something like 60 some odd
[Music]

06:46:57.750 --> 06:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:46:59.830 --> 06:46:59.840 align:start position:0%
and then it increased from there
 
06:47:02.230 --> 06:47:02.240 align:start position:0%
so this amendment
 
06:47:04.230 --> 06:47:04.240 align:start position:0%
would says that if any person who
 
06:47:05.830 --> 06:47:05.840 align:start position:0%
violates any provision of this section
 
06:47:07.270 --> 06:47:07.280 align:start position:0%
shall be guilty
 
06:47:07.280 --> 06:47:09.750 align:start position:0%
shall be guilty
violation

06:47:09.750 --> 06:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
violation
 
06:47:11.430 --> 06:47:11.440 align:start position:0%
the fine will go up
 
06:47:12.868 --> 06:47:12.878 align:start position:0%
from 300
 
06:47:14.948 --> 06:47:14.958 align:start position:0%
plus penalty assessment for a first
 
06:47:18.150 --> 06:47:18.160 align:start position:0%
offense and 500 plus penalty assessment
 
06:47:20.628 --> 06:47:20.638 align:start position:0%
for each subsequent offense
 
06:47:23.110 --> 06:47:23.120 align:start position:0%
and i think like i see you i hate people
 
06:47:24.548 --> 06:47:24.558 align:start position:0%
throwing trash out
 
06:47:26.948 --> 06:47:26.958 align:start position:0%
of their windows when they're driving on
 
06:47:29.190 --> 06:47:29.200 align:start position:0%
the highway and
 
06:47:31.110 --> 06:47:31.120 align:start position:0%
i feel they need to be made accountable
 
06:47:34.310 --> 06:47:34.320 align:start position:0%
so hence the amendment
 
06:47:34.320 --> 06:47:35.110 align:start position:0%
so hence the amendment
um

06:47:35.110 --> 06:47:35.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:47:38.628 --> 06:47:38.638 align:start position:0%
further discussion representativelerski
 
06:47:40.868 --> 06:47:40.878 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
06:47:42.948 --> 06:47:42.958 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to acknowledge some of the
 
06:47:45.350 --> 06:47:45.360 align:start position:0%
changes that um
 
06:47:48.070 --> 06:47:48.080 align:start position:0%
came through with this amendment um the
 
06:47:50.390 --> 06:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
original bill had a
 
06:47:54.310 --> 06:47:54.320 align:start position:0%
90-day license suspension which is a
 
06:47:57.030 --> 06:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
number people felt was an extremely uh
 
06:47:57.040 --> 06:47:58.390 align:start position:0%
number people felt was an extremely uh
extreme

06:47:58.390 --> 06:47:58.400 align:start position:0%
extreme
 
06:48:00.070 --> 06:48:00.080 align:start position:0%
penalty to be
 
06:48:01.750 --> 06:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
included on this and
 
06:48:04.788 --> 06:48:04.798 align:start position:0%
someone with the dmv pointed out
 
06:48:09.510 --> 06:48:09.520 align:start position:0%
that a much more serious offense of um
 
06:48:12.310 --> 06:48:12.320 align:start position:0%
reckless operation something like that
 
06:48:15.030 --> 06:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
only had a 60-day license suspension so
 
06:48:17.590 --> 06:48:17.600 align:start position:0%
i felt that we needed to
 
06:48:18.948 --> 06:48:18.958 align:start position:0%
bring it a little bit more in line as
 
06:48:20.390 --> 06:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
much as we want to make a point that
 
06:48:22.628 --> 06:48:22.638 align:start position:0%
littering is
 
06:48:25.430 --> 06:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
really not acceptable in our state we
 
06:48:26.788 --> 06:48:26.798 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that it's in line with
 
06:48:29.110 --> 06:48:29.120 align:start position:0%
the other uh penalties that we have on
 
06:48:30.708 --> 06:48:30.718 align:start position:0%
the um
 
06:48:32.628 --> 06:48:32.638 align:start position:0%
the fine list
 
06:48:33.910 --> 06:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
and then the only other thing that was
 
06:48:35.750 --> 06:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
changed that i want to just acknowledge
 
06:48:38.548 --> 06:48:38.558 align:start position:0%
is that we removed the line that it's a
 
06:48:41.270 --> 06:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
minimum fine of 300
 
06:48:44.070 --> 06:48:44.080 align:start position:0%
we've learned through testimony that
 
06:48:45.590 --> 06:48:45.600 align:start position:0%
when you do a range
 
06:48:47.590 --> 06:48:47.600 align:start position:0%
such as that for a fine it's very
 
06:48:50.548 --> 06:48:50.558 align:start position:0%
difficult for both the back end to input
 
06:48:52.468 --> 06:48:52.478 align:start position:0%
it all into the system and for an
 
06:48:54.868 --> 06:48:54.878 align:start position:0%
officer to actually decide on what an
 
06:48:56.468 --> 06:48:56.478 align:start position:0%
appropriate fine is
 
06:48:58.070 --> 06:48:58.080 align:start position:0%
and it's just much easier to have a set
 
06:49:00.788 --> 06:49:00.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:02.390 --> 06:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
i appreciate the changes that came with
 
06:49:02.400 --> 06:49:03.510 align:start position:0%
i appreciate the changes that came with
this

06:49:03.510 --> 06:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:49:05.510 --> 06:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
i will say on the record i do think that
 
06:49:05.520 --> 06:49:06.310 align:start position:0%
i will say on the record i do think that
the

06:49:06.310 --> 06:49:06.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:49:08.628 --> 06:49:08.638 align:start position:0%
fine amounts are a little bit high but i
 
06:49:10.788 --> 06:49:10.798 align:start position:0%
would much rather see something go
 
06:49:10.798 --> 06:49:11.910 align:start position:0%
would much rather see something go
through

06:49:11.910 --> 06:49:11.920 align:start position:0%
through
 
06:49:14.468 --> 06:49:14.478 align:start position:0%
that um does increase the penalty so i
 
06:49:16.548 --> 06:49:16.558 align:start position:0%
will be voting for the amendment
 
06:49:19.590 --> 06:49:19.600 align:start position:0%
thank you i'll i'll just add uh the
 
06:49:21.590 --> 06:49:21.600 align:start position:0%
other change from the original bill
 
06:49:23.670 --> 06:49:23.680 align:start position:0%
uh the first draft with the original
 
06:49:25.430 --> 06:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
bill i should say did not mention
 
06:49:27.430 --> 06:49:27.440 align:start position:0%
penalty assessments which are the fees
 
06:49:30.070 --> 06:49:30.080 align:start position:0%
for administration uh costs so those
 
06:49:32.708 --> 06:49:32.718 align:start position:0%
were also added in the amendment
 
06:49:37.990 --> 06:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:39.990 --> 06:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
did you have a question representative
 
06:49:41.830 --> 06:49:41.840 align:start position:0%
thank you so much chairman i just want
 
06:49:45.030 --> 06:49:45.040 align:start position:0%

06:50:06.548 --> 06:50:06.558 align:start position:0%
affect the most vulnerable and
 
06:50:09.350 --> 06:50:09.360 align:start position:0%
less wealthy amongst us
 
06:50:13.430 --> 06:50:13.440 align:start position:0%

i live in southern new hampshire do a
 
06:50:22.868 --> 06:50:22.878 align:start position:0%
lot of commuting every year
 
06:50:25.750 --> 06:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
i actually witness a lot of littering
 
06:50:28.070 --> 06:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
and i think it's reprehensible uh when i
 
06:50:31.190 --> 06:50:31.200 align:start position:0%
heard it was 62.50 for first offense for
 
06:50:31.200 --> 06:50:32.230 align:start position:0%
heard it was 62.50 for first offense for
littering

06:50:32.230 --> 06:50:32.240 align:start position:0%
littering
 
06:50:34.150 --> 06:50:34.160 align:start position:0%
i i looked at this bill a little bit
 
06:50:35.670 --> 06:50:35.680 align:start position:0%
differently and said you know what maybe
 
06:50:38.788 --> 06:50:38.798 align:start position:0%
this is does does bring it more in line
 
06:50:40.868 --> 06:50:40.878 align:start position:0%
i'm happier with the changes
 
06:50:42.548 --> 06:50:42.558 align:start position:0%

06:50:50.390 --> 06:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
roll call
 
06:50:52.070 --> 06:50:52.080 align:start position:0%

06:53:24.558 --> 06:53:27.830 align:start position:0%
 
no

06:53:27.830 --> 06:53:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:27.840 --> 06:53:39.910 align:start position:0%
 
yes

06:53:39.910 --> 06:53:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:39.920 --> 06:53:51.590 align:start position:0%
 
yes

06:53:51.590 --> 06:53:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:51.600 --> 06:53:52.468 align:start position:0%
 
yes

06:53:52.468 --> 06:53:52.478 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:53:54.230 --> 06:53:54.240 align:start position:0%
representative fox
 
06:53:54.240 --> 06:54:06.230 align:start position:0%
representative fox
yes

06:54:06.230 --> 06:54:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:06.240 --> 06:54:15.350 align:start position:0%
 
yes

06:54:15.350 --> 06:54:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:15.360 --> 06:54:16.150 align:start position:0%
 
so

06:54:16.150 --> 06:54:16.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:54:17.670 --> 06:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
the committee recommendation of art to
 
06:54:21.670 --> 06:54:21.680 align:start position:0%
pass as amended is adopted 16-1
 
06:54:23.670 --> 06:54:23.680 align:start position:0%
this is an early bill i presume it'll be
 
06:54:25.830 --> 06:54:25.840 align:start position:0%
going to ways and means
 
06:54:27.590 --> 06:54:27.600 align:start position:0%
that being said i don't believe it can
 
06:54:30.150 --> 06:54:30.160 align:start position:0%
go on consent
 
06:54:32.390 --> 06:54:32.400 align:start position:0%
but i'll ask the question after the fact
 
06:54:34.150 --> 06:54:34.160 align:start position:0%
is there any opposition from the
 
06:54:36.788 --> 06:54:36.798 align:start position:0%
committee if i can get it on consent
 
06:54:39.510 --> 06:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
excuse me mr chair yep i'm
 
06:54:41.750 --> 06:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
um it's my understanding that bills that
 
06:54:43.910 --> 06:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
have a fiscal note cannot go and consent
 
06:54:45.350 --> 06:54:45.360 align:start position:0%
i don't believe it can which is what i
 
06:54:47.110 --> 06:54:47.120 align:start position:0%
said okay but i figured i would see
 
06:54:49.110 --> 06:54:49.120 align:start position:0%
because it is still pretty low uh what
 
06:54:51.350 --> 06:54:51.360 align:start position:0%
that cut off is in his second committee
 
06:54:54.150 --> 06:54:54.160 align:start position:0%
i'm 99 sure it won't be on console okay
 
06:54:55.830 --> 06:54:55.840 align:start position:0%
uh but i just figured i'd give myself
 
06:54:58.070 --> 06:54:58.080 align:start position:0%
that one percent chance that we can get
 
06:54:59.350 --> 06:54:59.360 align:start position:0%
it there and make things simpler in
 
06:55:01.110 --> 06:55:01.120 align:start position:0%
session okay
 
06:55:01.120 --> 06:55:01.830 align:start position:0%
session okay
so

06:55:01.830 --> 06:55:01.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:55:04.230 --> 06:55:04.240 align:start position:0%
okay um so that being said i'll close
 
06:55:07.190 --> 06:55:07.200 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on house bill 1461
 
06:55:07.200 --> 06:55:08.390 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on house bill 1461
fbn

06:55:08.390 --> 06:55:08.400 align:start position:0%
fbn
 
06:55:09.830 --> 06:55:09.840 align:start position:0%
so if you give us a couple minutes to
 
06:55:12.548 --> 06:55:12.558 align:start position:0%
reset we have i think one more that we
 
06:55:14.390 --> 06:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
can do maybe two
 
06:55:14.400 --> 06:59:19.830 align:start position:0%
can do maybe two
yep

06:59:19.830 --> 06:59:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:19.840 --> 07:01:53.830 align:start position:0%
 
you

07:01:53.830 --> 07:01:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:53.840 --> 07:03:00.070 align:start position:0%
 
you

07:03:00.070 --> 07:03:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:04.070 --> 07:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
okay ladies and gentlemen welcome back
 
07:03:06.868 --> 07:03:06.878 align:start position:0%
one i did not open uh the executive
 
07:03:10.150 --> 07:03:10.160 align:start position:0%
session on this would be house bill
 
07:03:10.160 --> 07:03:12.310 align:start position:0%
session on this would be house bill
1464.

07:03:12.310 --> 07:03:12.320 align:start position:0%
