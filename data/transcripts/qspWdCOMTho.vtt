[Music]

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:06.360 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:07:10.469 --> 00:07:10.479 align:start position:0%
I'm um the the email sold up there so I
 
00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:13.120 align:start position:0%
couldn't see sorry um so I'm just
 
00:07:15.909 --> 00:07:15.919 align:start position:0%
wanting to know if you could explain uh
 
00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
what the plan is for today um we got
 
00:07:22.469 --> 00:07:22.479 align:start position:0%
this sheet of paper um that lists where
 
00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:26.800 align:start position:0%
all the pages are in our huge book um
 
00:07:28.749 --> 00:07:28.759 align:start position:0%
and so I'm wondering if we're supposed
 
00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
to be looking at the budget book while
 
00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:33.280 align:start position:0%
be we're hearing these pres
 
00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
presentations now and for the next few
 
00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:39.400 align:start position:0%
days or are we going to have
 
00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:42.400 align:start position:0%
presentations and then start the work of
 
00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:44.720 align:start position:0%
going through the budget Page by
 
00:07:47.149 --> 00:07:47.159 align:start position:0%
page at a later
 
00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:50.360 align:start position:0%
date clarification that that that's a
 
00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
that's a very fine question uh here here
 
00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:56.440 align:start position:0%
was my concept I wanted to start out by
 
00:07:58.670 --> 00:07:58.680 align:start position:0%
making sure that we understood who the
 
00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:00.560 align:start position:0%
speakers and departments were for the
 
00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:04.080 align:start position:0%
day that's why I shared that email um
 
00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:07.960 align:start position:0%
and with that confirmed prior to each
 
00:08:11.189 --> 00:08:11.199 align:start position:0%
individual starting their Department my
 
00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:15.120 align:start position:0%
intent is to take a few moments
 
00:08:17.189 --> 00:08:17.199 align:start position:0%
administratively to make sure that we
 
00:08:19.749 --> 00:08:19.759 align:start position:0%
all have the the right part of the
 
00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:22.520 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet up and the right part of the
 
00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
PowerPoint ready to share and and we'll
 
00:08:29.149 --> 00:08:29.159 align:start position:0%
go through uh as the Departments of um
 
00:08:33.269 --> 00:08:33.279 align:start position:0%
uh prepared for us today uh at which
 
00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
point when they conclude we'll ask
 
00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:38.200 align:start position:0%
questions at the end and if you have a
 
00:08:39.829 --> 00:08:39.839 align:start position:0%
question in the middle just raise your
 
00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:42.120 align:start position:0%
hand and and we'll interrupt and you you
 
00:08:44.389 --> 00:08:44.399 align:start position:0%
have a followup go ahead thank you
 
00:08:46.949 --> 00:08:46.959 align:start position:0%
followup so so we're supposed to have
 
00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:50.240 align:start position:0%
our big budget book beside us also so we
 
00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:52.720 align:start position:0%
can go back and forth during the
 
00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:54.800 align:start position:0%
presentation is that what you're saying
 
00:08:57.829 --> 00:08:57.839 align:start position:0%
I'm confused I'm sorry we we no that's
 
00:09:01.389 --> 00:09:01.399 align:start position:0%
fine I'm I'm probably is speaking so um
 
00:09:03.389 --> 00:09:03.399 align:start position:0%
the budget book is not yet available I
 
00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:05.600 align:start position:0%
think that got clarified by Mr Ripple in
 
00:09:08.269 --> 00:09:08.279 align:start position:0%
the email last night that uh the our
 
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:10.240 align:start position:0%
budget book has not been printed it's
 
00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:12.760 align:start position:0%
not been mailed out what we have
 
00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:16.360 align:start position:0%
received are emails with the spreadsheet
 
00:09:19.949 --> 00:09:19.959 align:start position:0%
emails with the draft uh house bill
 
00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
to is you that doesn't look like go
 
00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:25.320 align:start position:0%
ahead Mr Ripple sure I was just going to
 
00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:27.440 align:start position:0%
comment that I think everyone was mailed
 
00:09:30.389 --> 00:09:30.399 align:start position:0%
a hard copy of the governor's recommend
 
00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:33.000 align:start position:0%
budget is that right so you should have
 
00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:35.000 align:start position:0%
what you don't have is the briefing book
 
00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:37.120 align:start position:0%
to be provided by HHS and I think you'll
 
00:09:42.069 --> 00:09:42.079 align:start position:0%
get that by early next week latest so my
 
00:09:44.269 --> 00:09:44.279 align:start position:0%
expectation and the committee may have a
 
00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:47.880 align:start position:0%
different idea was that following each
 
00:09:50.829 --> 00:09:50.839 align:start position:0%
presentation for each division uh the
 
00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:53.000 align:start position:0%
department would then walk you through
 
00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:55.480 align:start position:0%
the budget Pages for that division so my
 
00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
thought was that you would actually be
 
00:09:58.470 --> 00:09:58.480 align:start position:0%
looking at the budget Pages starting
 
00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:01.150 align:start position:0%
looking at the budget Pages starting
today

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:01.160 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question
 
00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:04.640 align:start position:0%
representative norg yes that's not the
 
00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
way we've done it before so thank you
 
00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:07.320 align:start position:0%
for the
 
00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:10.640 align:start position:0%
clarification okay and um I knew that we
 
00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
got the big binder I I thought we were
 
00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
referring to the budget book which is
 
00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:17.069 align:start position:0%
referring to the budget book which is
something

00:10:17.069 --> 00:10:17.079 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:21.880 align:start position:0%
different um all right um so
 
00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
commissioner chabanet I I uh and then uh
 
00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
represent not representative but um Miss
 
00:10:33.269 --> 00:10:33.279 align:start position:0%
rounds is is uh Co co-starring with you
 
00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:36.600 align:start position:0%
today yes yes I will um if you're ready
 
00:10:38.509 --> 00:10:38.519 align:start position:0%
I'll go ahead and kick us off and share
 
00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
my screen okay uh before we do that I
 
00:10:43.829 --> 00:10:43.839 align:start position:0%
just want to uh make sure that you're
 
00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
welcomed to the committee um this is
 
00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:48.040 align:start position:0%
going to be a little bit different than
 
00:10:49.829 --> 00:10:49.839 align:start position:0%
the way you've done it in the past I'm
 
00:10:53.629 --> 00:10:53.639 align:start position:0%
sure uh I I I I I wanted to introduce
 
00:10:57.190 --> 00:10:57.200 align:start position:0%
myself uh to you to say that I have a a
 
00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:00.120 align:start position:0%
long career in in the Army and working
 
00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:02.200 align:start position:0%
with budgets and and when I take a look
 
00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:04.200 align:start position:0%
at budgets I have very specific
 
00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:07.480 align:start position:0%
questions uh my goal is to understand
 
00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:10.160 align:start position:0%
the underlying operations in the
 
00:11:12.269 --> 00:11:12.279 align:start position:0%
military we used to say no money no
 
00:11:15.269 --> 00:11:15.279 align:start position:0%
Mission and the opposite is also true if
 
00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:17.680 align:start position:0%
you have a mission we need to finance it
 
00:11:20.269 --> 00:11:20.279 align:start position:0%
appropriately in order to get it done so
 
00:11:23.269 --> 00:11:23.279 align:start position:0%
what my goal is in these meetings is to
 
00:11:26.069 --> 00:11:26.079 align:start position:0%
really get to understand more about your
 
00:11:29.269 --> 00:11:29.279 align:start position:0%
operations I took a look at your present
 
00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:31.720 align:start position:0%
presentation that you put together M RS
 
00:11:34.629 --> 00:11:34.639 align:start position:0%
and it looks like you took the template
 
00:11:37.269 --> 00:11:37.279 align:start position:0%
that got sent to you by Mr Ripple and
 
00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:39.880 align:start position:0%
that you attempted to incorporate U
 
00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
parts of it into your presentation is
 
00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:44.200 align:start position:0%
that right correct yes I believe that
 
00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:46.680 align:start position:0%
will answer virtually all your questions
 
00:11:48.629 --> 00:11:48.639 align:start position:0%
okay I really do appreciate that that's
 
00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
going to help me a great deal and so
 
00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:54.800 align:start position:0%
with that um if uh if you need some help
 
00:11:58.030 --> 00:11:58.040 align:start position:0%
sharing your your your uh presentation
 
00:12:01.629 --> 00:12:01.639 align:start position:0%
you you may start great thank you um so
 
00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
first I just introduce myself I'm Karen
 
00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
rounds I'm the Chief Financial Officer
 
00:12:07.509 --> 00:12:07.519 align:start position:0%
for the Department I've been with the
 
00:12:10.509 --> 00:12:10.519 align:start position:0%
Department three years um the first
 
00:12:12.629 --> 00:12:12.639 align:start position:0%
presentation we're going to do today is
 
00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:15.680 align:start position:0%
an overview of DHHS and our overall
 
00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
budget and then we're going to start
 
00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:20.160 align:start position:0%
going through the oom uh Office of the
 
00:12:23.189 --> 00:12:23.199 align:start position:0%
commissioner budgets uh Lori Weaver will
 
00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:26.360 align:start position:0%
kick us off there and then I will um use
 
00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
my accounting unit uh for finance and
 
00:12:32.389 --> 00:12:32.399 align:start position:0%
contracts as our guinea pig if you will
 
00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:34.240 align:start position:0%
to sort of walk through how we how we
 
00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:35.720 align:start position:0%
might go through this process and
 
00:12:37.629 --> 00:12:37.639 align:start position:0%
hopefully that will answer a lot of the
 
00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
questions um that you have on on how we
 
00:12:43.189 --> 00:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
typically go through it um so with that
 
00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:44.910 align:start position:0%
I'm going to go ahead and
 
00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:47.189 align:start position:0%
I'm going to go ahead and
[Music]

00:12:47.189 --> 00:12:47.199 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:53.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:55.509 --> 00:12:55.519 align:start position:0%
presentation okay and I'm going to go
 
00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
ahead and turn it over to commissioner
 
00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:59.430 align:start position:0%
ahead and turn it over to commissioner
shanet

00:12:59.430 --> 00:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
shanet
 
00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:01.560 align:start position:0%
good morning everyone and thank you for
 
00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:04.360 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to uh sit and talk a
 
00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
little bit about the department and what
 
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:06.829 align:start position:0%
little bit about the department and what
we

00:13:06.829 --> 00:13:06.839 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:10.360 align:start position:0%
do I think most of you know that uh
 
00:13:12.509 --> 00:13:12.519 align:start position:0%
we've spent the last year largely
 
00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
focused on covid uh DHHS it's uh been a
 
00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:20.600 align:start position:0%
trying year for sure but we are looking
 
00:13:23.269 --> 00:13:23.279 align:start position:0%
forward to being more future oriented
 
00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:25.600 align:start position:0%
and forward-looking um some of that is
 
00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
with the hope that we're about to see
 
00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:29.880 align:start position:0%
some relief from covid so that we can go
 
00:13:32.509 --> 00:13:32.519 align:start position:0%
back to focusing on some of the things
 
00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:35.720 align:start position:0%
that we were doing prior to covid and
 
00:13:38.189 --> 00:13:38.199 align:start position:0%
and really start looking at the impact
 
00:13:40.189 --> 00:13:40.199 align:start position:0%
on covid and trying to pull some of our
 
00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:43.720 align:start position:0%
vulnerable back into um society and
 
00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:46.120 align:start position:0%
their communities um in the in a way in
 
00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
which they were prior to covid and
 
00:13:51.829 --> 00:13:51.839 align:start position:0%
probably in a better position
 
00:13:51.839 --> 00:13:53.470 align:start position:0%
probably in a better position
postco

00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:53.480 align:start position:0%
postco
 
00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:55.680 align:start position:0%
so what what you're going to see
 
00:13:59.350 --> 00:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
throughout the budget uh is is really
 
00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:02.240 align:start position:0%
focused on transformational change of
 
00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
our systems um what we've discovered
 
00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:08.440 align:start position:0%
during covid is definitely some gaps in
 
00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
our system but a lot of the things that
 
00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:12.720 align:start position:0%
that we're focusing on in the next
 
00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
biennium are things that uh that we've
 
00:14:19.069 --> 00:14:19.079 align:start position:0%
been working on more on a micro level
 
00:14:21.269 --> 00:14:21.279 align:start position:0%
and you know part of the mission is to
 
00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:24.240 align:start position:0%
zoom back and say what do we really need
 
00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:28.160 align:start position:0%
to do with this system or this this
 
00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:31.360 align:start position:0%
operation to to make it to be
 
00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:33.480 align:start position:0%
transformative and transformation
 
00:14:37.069 --> 00:14:37.079 align:start position:0%
doesn't just involve transforming the
 
00:14:38.509 --> 00:14:38.519 align:start position:0%
systems of
 
00:14:40.949 --> 00:14:40.959 align:start position:0%
care um through operations and
 
00:14:43.189 --> 00:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
infrastructure but it also involves
 
00:14:43.199 --> 00:14:44.710 align:start position:0%
infrastructure but it also involves
transforming

00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:44.720 align:start position:0%
transforming
 
00:14:47.269 --> 00:14:47.279 align:start position:0%
perspective and sometimes that means
 
00:14:51.389 --> 00:14:51.399 align:start position:0%
redefining how we think of things on how
 
00:14:53.310 --> 00:14:53.320 align:start position:0%
care should be provided who should be
 
00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:55.360 align:start position:0%
providing care so I think what you're
 
00:14:57.629 --> 00:14:57.639 align:start position:0%
going to see interweaved into this
 
00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:00.920 align:start position:0%
budget and into what our mission is for
 
00:15:03.509 --> 00:15:03.519 align:start position:0%
the next couple of years is really
 
00:15:05.749 --> 00:15:05.759 align:start position:0%
looking at our systems and how uh we
 
00:15:07.949 --> 00:15:07.959 align:start position:0%
Define them how we should be redefining
 
00:15:11.269 --> 00:15:11.279 align:start position:0%
them and really about um building on
 
00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:13.880 align:start position:0%
strategy and transformation of our
 
00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:16.160 align:start position:0%
systems so if we want to go to the next
 
00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:17.320 align:start position:0%
slide I'm just going to give you a
 
00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:20.240 align:start position:0%
general overview of our mission and you
 
00:15:22.269 --> 00:15:22.279 align:start position:0%
will see that our mission is to join
 
00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:24.120 align:start position:0%
families and communities providing
 
00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:26.040 align:start position:0%
opportunities for citizens to achieve
 
00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
Health meeting the the the basic human
 
00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:31.480 align:start position:0%
needs and the health need and providing
 
00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:33.720 align:start position:0%
treatment and support for our most
 
00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
vulnerable residents and to protect and
 
00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:37.480 align:start position:0%
care for New Hampshire so although this
 
00:15:38.389 --> 00:15:38.399 align:start position:0%
is our
 
00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:40.680 align:start position:0%
mission the one thing that I do want to
 
00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:44.160 align:start position:0%
point out hello are are you are you
 
00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
willing to take questions or do you want
 
00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
to go all the way through to the end
 
00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:50.440 align:start position:0%
before you take any questions like like
 
00:15:53.189 --> 00:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
on this page I want to ask if this is a
 
00:15:55.629 --> 00:15:55.639 align:start position:0%
statutory Mission or if this is a
 
00:15:59.189 --> 00:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
mission that's been developed um through
 
00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
years of
 
00:16:03.309 --> 00:16:03.319 align:start position:0%
experience so that is definitely
 
00:16:05.189 --> 00:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
something that I'm I'm gonna have to go
 
00:16:07.629 --> 00:16:07.639 align:start position:0%
back and look at how the mission of the
 
00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:10.360 align:start position:0%
department was developed our mission and
 
00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:12.160 align:start position:0%
our mission statement is much longer
 
00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:15.720 align:start position:0%
than this this is a just a a brief
 
00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:17.880 align:start position:0%
snippet of what's in our mission but I
 
00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:19.800 align:start position:0%
can find out its development I know that
 
00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:22.720 align:start position:0%
it's been around for a long time um so I
 
00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:26.360 align:start position:0%
can we can do some digging and find out
 
00:16:29.389 --> 00:16:29.399 align:start position:0%
how this Mission came to be okay I'm
 
00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
sorry to interrupt you but it's just
 
00:16:33.309 --> 00:16:33.319 align:start position:0%
that this is going to be a consistent
 
00:16:35.949 --> 00:16:35.959 align:start position:0%
point that M rounds May pick up on is
 
00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:38.480 align:start position:0%
that I I I think it's important for us
 
00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:41.360 align:start position:0%
to be able to distinguish between the
 
00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:44.680 align:start position:0%
missions that you have statutorily
 
00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
versus the missions that have been
 
00:16:50.069 --> 00:16:50.079 align:start position:0%
adopted or taken on because they're just
 
00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:53.160 align:start position:0%
good for the general public so I I'd
 
00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
like to know where those boundaries are
 
00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:57.680 align:start position:0%
uh as as I learn your department more
 
00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:59.350 align:start position:0%
uh as as I learn your department more
deeply

00:16:59.350 --> 00:16:59.360 align:start position:0%
deeply
 
00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:02.120 align:start position:0%
okay great we can do that so one of the
 
00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:04.480 align:start position:0%
things that I want to point out in in
 
00:17:07.029 --> 00:17:07.039 align:start position:0%
our mission is that although this is the
 
00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
mission of the department it is not only
 
00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:10.189 align:start position:0%
mission of the department it is not only
our

00:17:10.189 --> 00:17:10.199 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:13.400 align:start position:0%
responsibility um a lot of times what
 
00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:16.520 align:start position:0%
you'll hear either through media or
 
00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
through legislative hearings is that
 
00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:21.160 align:start position:0%
this is the state's responsibility to
 
00:17:22.669 --> 00:17:22.679 align:start position:0%
take care of the vulnerable residents
 
00:17:24.350 --> 00:17:24.360 align:start position:0%
and although it is part of our mission
 
00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:25.720 align:start position:0%
and our
 
00:17:27.870 --> 00:17:27.880 align:start position:0%
responsibility many of our initiatives
 
00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
in in the coming two years will involve
 
00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:31.240 align:start position:0%
working with our partners in the
 
00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:32.720 align:start position:0%
community to enhance care in the
 
00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:35.160 align:start position:0%
community because it is also the
 
00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
community's uh responsibility to take
 
00:17:39.909 --> 00:17:39.919 align:start position:0%
care of of our vulnerable residents
 
00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:42.520 align:start position:0%
whether that be other Health Care
 
00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:45.280 align:start position:0%
Systems our hospitals our community
 
00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:48.160 align:start position:0%
health providers um in communities in
 
00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:50.240 align:start position:0%
general we all have a collective
 
00:17:52.029 --> 00:17:52.039 align:start position:0%
responsibility to take care of our most
 
00:17:52.039 --> 00:17:54.029 align:start position:0%
responsibility to take care of our most
vulnerable

00:17:54.029 --> 00:17:54.039 align:start position:0%
vulnerable
 
00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:00.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
so some of the key roles for DHHS you
 
00:18:06.789 --> 00:18:06.799 align:start position:0%
will see um number one is to educate the
 
00:18:09.149 --> 00:18:09.159 align:start position:0%
public and we do this in a variety of of
 
00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:12.520 align:start position:0%
ways through both Direct Care uh direct
 
00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:16.120 align:start position:0%
client facing services and also through
 
00:18:17.789 --> 00:18:17.799 align:start position:0%
you know our Public Health Department
 
00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:20.120 align:start position:0%
who does a who does a ton of public
 
00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
education around all things uh Public
 
00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
Health uh deliver services to clients
 
00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:28.840 align:start position:0%
you will see that we have many client
 
00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
facing services that we uh that we are
 
00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
responsible for both our district
 
00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:36.520 align:start position:0%
offices around the state that does
 
00:18:40.029 --> 00:18:40.039 align:start position:0%
eligibility um we have a call center and
 
00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:42.440 align:start position:0%
then we have all you know some of our
 
00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
our uh Direct Care Providers which you
 
00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:46.760 align:start position:0%
which you probably know very well New
 
00:18:49.909 --> 00:18:49.919 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital Glen Cliff home um we
 
00:18:53.789 --> 00:18:53.799 align:start position:0%
have a drf uh in Laconia and the sununu
 
00:18:57.190 --> 00:18:57.200 align:start position:0%
center all uh state run direct service
 
00:18:59.909 --> 00:18:59.919 align:start position:0%
providers uh to our
 
00:19:02.110 --> 00:19:02.120 align:start position:0%
clients and then protect the health and
 
00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:03.880 align:start position:0%
safety of our citizens we protect the
 
00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:05.880 align:start position:0%
most vulnerable ensure prevention work
 
00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
is done to prevent becoming vulnerable
 
00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:11.080 align:start position:0%
um and much of that is done in public
 
00:19:14.029 --> 00:19:14.039 align:start position:0%
health and through some of our you know
 
00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:17.480 align:start position:0%
DCF and Adult Protective Services
 
00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
programs we provide regulatory oversight
 
00:19:22.789 --> 00:19:22.799 align:start position:0%
to all of these entities Health
 
00:19:24.909 --> 00:19:24.919 align:start position:0%
Facilities Child Care Facilities food
 
00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:26.600 align:start position:0%
service and public health disease
 
00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:29.000 align:start position:0%
prevention and surveillance we do this
 
00:19:30.789 --> 00:19:30.799 align:start position:0%
through licensing and certification in
 
00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:33.320 align:start position:0%
most areas but we do have a very
 
00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
prominent role in regulatory oversight
 
00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:38.480 align:start position:0%
and then ensure program in operational
 
00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:40.600 align:start position:0%
integrity and I I think what you will
 
00:19:44.549 --> 00:19:44.559 align:start position:0%
see this bium as we look at
 
00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:47.440 align:start position:0%
transformation partnership with our our
 
00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:49.640 align:start position:0%
community providers it's more of a focus
 
00:19:53.549 --> 00:19:53.559 align:start position:0%
on this to ensure that when we fund or
 
00:19:56.110 --> 00:19:56.120 align:start position:0%
we provide grants to Our Community
 
00:19:59.029 --> 00:19:59.039 align:start position:0%
Partners that the programs that being
 
00:20:01.029 --> 00:20:01.039 align:start position:0%
delivered have the outcomes that we
 
00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
anticipated and I think you know
 
00:20:06.029 --> 00:20:06.039 align:start position:0%
historically I think that we work very
 
00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:09.400 align:start position:0%
hard to um to fund and provide
 
00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:11.720 align:start position:0%
programming to different areas of our
 
00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:14.840 align:start position:0%
state and once it's going we're we're
 
00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
we're happy and we're thrilled and it's
 
00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:19.360 align:start position:0%
not often that we take a step back and
 
00:20:22.029 --> 00:20:22.039 align:start position:0%
say now are the outcomes of that program
 
00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
what we expected to be 3 years ago or
 
00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:26.120 align:start position:0%
four years ago when we first started the
 
00:20:28.789 --> 00:20:28.799 align:start position:0%
program how are they measuring up and
 
00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:30.440 align:start position:0%
and I think what you will see in the
 
00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
next two years is more of a focus on
 
00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
that that we start to evaluate you know
 
00:20:38.789 --> 00:20:38.799 align:start position:0%
um how are our doorway programs doing
 
00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:40.720 align:start position:0%
how are Community Mental Health Services
 
00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:43.960 align:start position:0%
being provided um how how are all of our
 
00:20:45.669 --> 00:20:45.679 align:start position:0%
contracts being provided and are we
 
00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
expecting the outcomes how are how is
 
00:20:49.549 --> 00:20:49.559 align:start position:0%
Medicaid doing one of the B you know the
 
00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
biggest contracts in state government
 
00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:54.240 align:start position:0%
are Medicaid managed care you know how
 
00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
is that model for de Hampshire are we
 
00:20:58.270 --> 00:20:58.280 align:start position:0%
are we seeing the outcomes that we
 
00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:00.400 align:start position:0%
anticip ipated and and the program and
 
00:21:02.029 --> 00:21:02.039 align:start position:0%
operational Integrity part of the
 
00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:03.240 align:start position:0%
department is going to be really
 
00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:10.720 align:start position:0%
evaluations next slide Karen thank you
 
00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:12.760 align:start position:0%
this is the overview of how the
 
00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
department is structured um you will see
 
00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:18.360 align:start position:0%
that we're broken up into four or five
 
00:21:21.549 --> 00:21:21.559 align:start position:0%
different areas uh and then some sub
 
00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:24.440 align:start position:0%
areas under that this is uh this has
 
00:21:28.029 --> 00:21:28.039 align:start position:0%
been the organizational structure uh for
 
00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:29.880 align:start position:0%
the last couple years in the department
 
00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
it works well in the in our current
 
00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:34.240 align:start position:0%
structure as we start looking at
 
00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
transformational change in the
 
00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:38.720 align:start position:0%
department in both our systems and our
 
00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:40.880 align:start position:0%
definitions I think that you will see
 
00:21:42.789 --> 00:21:42.799 align:start position:0%
some change in the organizational
 
00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:44.720 align:start position:0%
structure of the
 
00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
department next
 
00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:50.520 align:start position:0%
slide this is the general Staffing of
 
00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:53.360 align:start position:0%
the department and you will see that we
 
00:21:55.310 --> 00:21:55.320 align:start position:0%
have a grand total of
 
00:21:58.070 --> 00:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
3,226 positions in the department of
 
00:21:58.080 --> 00:21:59.269 align:start position:0%
3,226 positions in the department of
notes

00:21:59.269 --> 00:21:59.279 align:start position:0%
notes
 
00:22:01.789 --> 00:22:01.799 align:start position:0%
that since the beginning of covid and
 
00:22:04.269 --> 00:22:04.279 align:start position:0%
hence the hiring freeze and just the
 
00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
general um the the climate in the
 
00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:09.720 align:start position:0%
environment of working with covid we
 
00:22:13.269 --> 00:22:13.279 align:start position:0%
have 760 positions open which is about
 
00:22:18.029 --> 00:22:18.039 align:start position:0%
20% of our our total positions um with
 
00:22:21.789 --> 00:22:21.799 align:start position:0%
the lifting of the hiring frees uh we do
 
00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
expect to be agressively recruiting for
 
00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:27.240 align:start position:0%
those 760 positions but it certainly has
 
00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:29.480 align:start position:0%
impacted our ability um at the
 
00:22:31.909 --> 00:22:31.919 align:start position:0%
department over the last uh six months
 
00:22:34.430 --> 00:22:34.440 align:start position:0%
or so to really uh get out and be
 
00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
proactive in a lot of the things we've
 
00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:37.880 align:start position:0%
done like I've said a lot of the work
 
00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
that we've done for the past year has
 
00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:42.240 align:start position:0%
been on covid and that's although covid
 
00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:44.320 align:start position:0%
sits in public health it really has been
 
00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:47.480 align:start position:0%
a full Department effort we have um
 
00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
staff from every area of the department
 
00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:52.760 align:start position:0%
helping out in covid operations so this
 
00:22:54.789 --> 00:22:54.799 align:start position:0%
is going to be a significant effort on
 
00:22:57.830 --> 00:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
our part for the next two years is to
 
00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
take that V can see right down and to
 
00:23:04.430 --> 00:23:04.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
transformative next slide
 
00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:10.360 align:start position:0%
Karen so I just want to touch a little
 
00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
on um there there's the impact has been
 
00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:21.400 align:start position:0%
widespread but I'm going to highlight a
 
00:23:23.549 --> 00:23:23.559 align:start position:0%
couple the public health response
 
00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
obviously they are at the Forefront of
 
00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:27.720 align:start position:0%
everything we're doing on covid um you
 
00:23:31.669 --> 00:23:31.679 align:start position:0%
see Dr Chan and Dr Daly um speaking at
 
00:23:33.789 --> 00:23:33.799 align:start position:0%
our press conferences each week they are
 
00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
really leading the these efforts in in
 
00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:39.960 align:start position:0%
the public health Forum um some of the
 
00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:41.360 align:start position:0%
things that we do the case
 
00:23:43.669 --> 00:23:43.679 align:start position:0%
investigations and the contact tracing
 
00:23:46.549 --> 00:23:46.559 align:start position:0%
being um probably one of the uh most
 
00:23:49.230 --> 00:23:49.240 align:start position:0%
significant parts of our covid response
 
00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:52.720 align:start position:0%
but then education uh around schools in
 
00:23:55.110 --> 00:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
nursing homes University Systems in the
 
00:23:57.669 --> 00:23:57.679 align:start position:0%
general public we do a ton of Education
 
00:24:00.070 --> 00:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
we have partner calls probably every day
 
00:24:02.149 --> 00:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
of the week with different entities from
 
00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:04.360 align:start position:0%
school nurses School administrators
 
00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:05.390 align:start position:0%
school nurses School administrators
colleges

00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:05.400 align:start position:0%
colleges
 
00:24:07.390 --> 00:24:07.400 align:start position:0%
universities uh long-term care
 
00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:09.480 align:start position:0%
facilities home care providers uh
 
00:24:12.149 --> 00:24:12.159 align:start position:0%
regularly meeting with them the hospital
 
00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
Association to provide education around
 
00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
that and then testing which was a sign
 
00:24:20.789 --> 00:24:20.799 align:start position:0%
Madam commissioner um sorry to interrupt
 
00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
you again but uh represent walner has a
 
00:24:25.909 --> 00:24:25.919 align:start position:0%
a break at 10 o'clock she needs and
 
00:24:28.029 --> 00:24:28.039 align:start position:0%
she's got a question so I I thought I'd
 
00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
give her chance to ask her question
 
00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:34.240 align:start position:0%
sure thank you commissioner and I'm
 
00:24:38.149 --> 00:24:38.159 align:start position:0%
sorry to to um interrupt your your
 
00:24:40.590 --> 00:24:40.600 align:start position:0%
presentation like that I'm sorry I
 
00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
actually had a question back on the
 
00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:45.149 align:start position:0%
actually had a question back on the
Staffing

00:24:45.149 --> 00:24:45.159 align:start position:0%
Staffing
 
00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:48.640 align:start position:0%
page yeah I had my I didn't get my hand
 
00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
up in time I guess while you were on the
 
00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:53.440 align:start position:0%
page I'm sorry
 
00:24:58.510 --> 00:24:58.520 align:start position:0%
um so when I look at this it says these
 
00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:00.840 align:start position:0%
are the permanent positions through the
 
00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
governor's phase so are these the
 
00:25:08.549 --> 00:25:08.559 align:start position:0%
proposed positions for the next budget
 
00:25:11.789 --> 00:25:11.799 align:start position:0%
the budget we're working on now or are
 
00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:15.640 align:start position:0%
these the uh positions that you have now
 
00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:17.640 align:start position:0%
that are
 
00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
authorized Kin I'm gonna let you answer
 
00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
that sure so it's actually both um but
 
00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:26.720 align:start position:0%
they so it's all of our currently
 
00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:31.000 align:start position:0%
authorized positions and it also is um
 
00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:33.240 align:start position:0%
some additional positions none of which
 
00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:36.360 align:start position:0%
are really new the only new positions we
 
00:25:38.269 --> 00:25:38.279 align:start position:0%
had this year were conversions where we
 
00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:40.200 align:start position:0%
converted temporary positions into
 
00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:42.240 align:start position:0%
permanent positions those were the only
 
00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
new positions we submitted um and those
 
00:25:47.230 --> 00:25:47.240 align:start position:0%
were all approved uh there
 
00:25:49.870 --> 00:25:49.880 align:start position:0%
was I don't remember the exact number
 
00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
throughout the department but there was
 
00:25:54.029 --> 00:25:54.039 align:start position:0%
a large number of those at New Hampshire
 
00:25:57.190 --> 00:25:57.200 align:start position:0%
hospital which were the positions that
 
00:25:59.549 --> 00:25:59.559 align:start position:0%
will um
 
00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
will work on the unit that was converted
 
00:26:04.110 --> 00:26:04.120 align:start position:0%
from a children's unit to an adult unit
 
00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:07.120 align:start position:0%
so those are the majority of the new and
 
00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:09.240 align:start position:0%
I put new in quotation marks but new
 
00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:11.480 align:start position:0%
positions um that were all conversions
 
00:26:15.870 --> 00:26:15.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:17.750 align:start position:0%
 
positions

00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
positions
 
00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
thank do do you have a followup
 
00:26:22.269 --> 00:26:22.279 align:start position:0%
representative walner yes could I just
 
00:26:28.789 --> 00:26:28.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:30.360 align:start position:0%
how many
 
00:26:34.789 --> 00:26:34.799 align:start position:0%
new positions are you requesting
 
00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:38.320 align:start position:0%
in the budget we're looking at now the
 
00:26:41.029 --> 00:26:41.039 align:start position:0%
the next budget we actually did not
 
00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
request any new positions we only
 
00:26:45.470 --> 00:26:45.480 align:start position:0%
requested converting temporary
 
00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:48.480 align:start position:0%
positions okay and could I have one more
 
00:26:51.789 --> 00:26:51.799 align:start position:0%
question all of those go
 
00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
ahead so there are no new positions um
 
00:26:58.710 --> 00:26:58.720 align:start position:0%
are there any positions that you had in
 
00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
the previous budget that are not
 
00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:05.360 align:start position:0%
included in the next budget so there is
 
00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
one position that you will see in hb1
 
00:27:13.029 --> 00:27:13.039 align:start position:0%
that shows as being abolished um and uh
 
00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:15.240 align:start position:0%
that position is being replaced by a new
 
00:27:17.950 --> 00:27:17.960 align:start position:0%
permanent position uh we needed to
 
00:27:20.590 --> 00:27:20.600 align:start position:0%
retire the position
 
00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:23.440 align:start position:0%
number okay so for positions you would
 
00:27:27.549 --> 00:27:27.559 align:start position:0%
say this is a a budget that is sort of
 
00:27:30.350 --> 00:27:30.360 align:start position:0%
flat as far as positions go it's not up
 
00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
or down for the most part we still have
 
00:27:37.909 --> 00:27:37.919 align:start position:0%
uh about 70ish unfunded positions um
 
00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
throughout the department but um other
 
00:27:43.149 --> 00:27:43.159 align:start position:0%
than that yes the positions still exist
 
00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
they're just not
 
00:27:47.549 --> 00:27:47.559 align:start position:0%
funded thank you and thank you chairman
 
00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
for letting me ask those questions and
 
00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry we had to go back you're very
 
00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:54.240 align:start position:0%
welcome there good questions I I had a a
 
00:27:57.789 --> 00:27:57.799 align:start position:0%
similar one on this particular slide
 
00:28:00.389 --> 00:28:00.399 align:start position:0%
could we we could we see what the
 
00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:04.200 align:start position:0%
numbers were um in the prior two budget
 
00:28:07.269 --> 00:28:07.279 align:start position:0%
Cycles so that it sounds like there's uh
 
00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:10.000 align:start position:0%
not a growth Trend but it'd be nice to
 
00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
see the numbers from the from the prior
 
00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:12.880 align:start position:0%
see the numbers from the from the prior
to

00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:12.890 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:28:12.890 --> 00:28:13.950 align:start position:0%
to
[Music]

00:28:13.950 --> 00:28:13.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:28:16.789 --> 00:28:16.799 align:start position:0%
banians I can do that what I would warn
 
00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:19.000 align:start position:0%
you of um and anyone that was on the
 
00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
committee last year will remember this
 
00:28:24.190 --> 00:28:24.200 align:start position:0%
is last banum we did a lot of cleanup
 
00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
work with putting positions in the right
 
00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:29.640 align:start position:0%
place um so much so that it was very
 
00:28:31.470 --> 00:28:31.480 align:start position:0%
frustrating for all of us because it was
 
00:28:33.149 --> 00:28:33.159 align:start position:0%
hard to follow where all the positions
 
00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
went so I would say that the grand total
 
00:28:39.310 --> 00:28:39.320 align:start position:0%
over the vums is probably going to be a
 
00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:41.320 align:start position:0%
more helpful number than by division
 
00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
because the division numbers would have
 
00:28:44.590 --> 00:28:44.600 align:start position:0%
shifted a lot but I will still provide
 
00:28:46.990 --> 00:28:47.000 align:start position:0%
it that way just be warned that it's
 
00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
probably not going to make a lot of
 
00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
sense thank you for that representative
 
00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:52.960 align:start position:0%
Earth already warned me that they was
 
00:28:55.509 --> 00:28:55.519 align:start position:0%
going to make explode and representative
 
00:28:57.070 --> 00:28:57.080 align:start position:0%
Earth will be happy to hear that there
 
00:28:59.870 --> 00:28:59.880 align:start position:0%
were very few I movements this year I I
 
00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
would say less than 40 which is very low
 
00:29:06.909 --> 00:29:06.919 align:start position:0%
for us so so if there are no further
 
00:29:09.230 --> 00:29:09.240 align:start position:0%
questions uh commissioner would you like
 
00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:13.080 align:start position:0%
to go back to where you were
 
00:29:15.509 --> 00:29:15.519 align:start position:0%
sure um so we were on the impact of
 
00:29:17.789 --> 00:29:17.799 align:start position:0%
covid and we had talked about the public
 
00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:21.080 align:start position:0%
health response um everything from um
 
00:29:23.389 --> 00:29:23.399 align:start position:0%
doing education case investigation
 
00:29:26.669 --> 00:29:26.679 align:start position:0%
contact facing testing nursing home
 
00:29:26.679 --> 00:29:28.230 align:start position:0%
contact facing testing nursing home
investigations

00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:28.240 align:start position:0%
investigations
 
00:29:30.909 --> 00:29:30.919 align:start position:0%
um but really a full Department response
 
00:29:33.029 --> 00:29:33.039 align:start position:0%
Public Health taking the lead on that
 
00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:36.120 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid case loads largely um going
 
00:29:39.230 --> 00:29:39.240 align:start position:0%
up um and Karen will explain this
 
00:29:41.549 --> 00:29:41.559 align:start position:0%
further down when Karen and Henry when
 
00:29:43.870 --> 00:29:43.880 align:start position:0%
you get to the Medicaid budget that uh
 
00:29:45.549 --> 00:29:45.559 align:start position:0%
the federal government increased our
 
00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:48.440 align:start position:0%
fmap which is our federal uh alloc our
 
00:29:50.269 --> 00:29:50.279 align:start position:0%
federal share of Medicaid but the
 
00:29:53.389 --> 00:29:53.399 align:start position:0%
requirement in that increase was that we
 
00:29:56.110 --> 00:29:56.120 align:start position:0%
not take anybody off Medicaid during the
 
00:29:58.509 --> 00:29:58.519 align:start position:0%
covid emergency so you will see
 
00:30:01.710 --> 00:30:01.720 align:start position:0%
increasing Medicaid case loads um every
 
00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:04.720 align:start position:0%
population that dhh serves was affected
 
00:30:08.029 --> 00:30:08.039 align:start position:0%
um every from you're hearing right now
 
00:30:10.789 --> 00:30:10.799 align:start position:0%
about um children's Behavioral Health in
 
00:30:13.389 --> 00:30:13.399 align:start position:0%
ER boarding you definitely have heard
 
00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:15.320 align:start position:0%
about our seniors the nursing home and
 
00:30:17.389 --> 00:30:17.399 align:start position:0%
the homebound that have been
 
00:30:20.029 --> 00:30:20.039 align:start position:0%
disproportionately affected by covid
 
00:30:23.149 --> 00:30:23.159 align:start position:0%
having uh some of the worst outcomes uh
 
00:30:25.149 --> 00:30:25.159 align:start position:0%
for from covid across the country and
 
00:30:27.470 --> 00:30:27.480 align:start position:0%
really across the globe that's not that
 
00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
is not New Hampshire issue that is uh
 
00:30:32.509 --> 00:30:32.519 align:start position:0%
really we're seeing that Trend across
 
00:30:36.029 --> 00:30:36.039 align:start position:0%
the across the entire country and
 
00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:38.480 align:start position:0%
overall you know the impact on isolation
 
00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:40.320 align:start position:0%
is probably the most significant thing
 
00:30:42.789 --> 00:30:42.799 align:start position:0%
that we've seen um when it comes to DHHS
 
00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:45.440 align:start position:0%
and that that really crosses all all
 
00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
populations from people with mental
 
00:30:48.909 --> 00:30:48.919 align:start position:0%
illness people with
 
00:30:52.269 --> 00:30:52.279 align:start position:0%
disabilities um you know kids not being
 
00:30:56.029 --> 00:30:56.039 align:start position:0%
in school the impact on that lack of
 
00:30:57.950 --> 00:30:57.960 align:start position:0%
social support the lack of peer support
 
00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
support and the the general isolation
 
00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
that covid has caused our communities is
 
00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:07.080 align:start position:0%
being felt in every area of the
 
00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
department and then finally the budget
 
00:31:14.149 --> 00:31:14.159 align:start position:0%
impact on Alvarez and Marcel um so back
 
00:31:16.269 --> 00:31:16.279 align:start position:0%
almost a year ago we were facing an
 
00:31:19.190 --> 00:31:19.200 align:start position:0%
uncertain deficit in our budget
 
00:31:23.509 --> 00:31:23.519 align:start position:0%
and we agreed that we should bring on a
 
00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:26.120 align:start position:0%
a consulting firm to look at our our
 
00:31:28.230 --> 00:31:28.240 align:start position:0%
department both operationally and
 
00:31:31.389 --> 00:31:31.399 align:start position:0%
budget-wise to see if we can find
 
00:31:33.669 --> 00:31:33.679 align:start position:0%
efficiencies um efficiencies and how we
 
00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:36.360 align:start position:0%
run operations efficiencies in our
 
00:31:40.590 --> 00:31:40.600 align:start position:0%
budget and we did do that and uh Alvarez
 
00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:43.480 align:start position:0%
and Marcel or A&amp;M as we've called it was
 
00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:45.200 align:start position:0%
embedded in the department for several
 
00:31:47.830 --> 00:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
months and uh really have been very
 
00:31:50.389 --> 00:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
helpful so some of the things that uh
 
00:31:52.909 --> 00:31:52.919 align:start position:0%
came out of that that review and what
 
00:31:55.789 --> 00:31:55.799 align:start position:0%
you will see coming through into the the
 
00:31:58.389 --> 00:31:58.399 align:start position:0%
budget that you have before you
 
00:32:01.070 --> 00:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
um a recommendation to do an IMD waiver
 
00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
which is a waiver that allows us to bill
 
00:32:07.310 --> 00:32:07.320 align:start position:0%
for Medicaid for inpatient adults at New
 
00:32:10.789 --> 00:32:10.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital this is uh very
 
00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:14.480 align:start position:0%
beneficial for us right now uh adults
 
00:32:16.990 --> 00:32:17.000 align:start position:0%
that are in an impatient stay at an IMD
 
00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:19.080 align:start position:0%
that's an in Institution for mental
 
00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
disease uh are not eligible for Medicaid
 
00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:24.720 align:start position:0%
reimbursement which has a 50% uh Federal
 
00:32:27.909 --> 00:32:27.919 align:start position:0%
share so we will be filing that waiver
 
00:32:29.549 --> 00:32:29.559 align:start position:0%
hopefully to be done by the end of the
 
00:32:32.509 --> 00:32:32.519 align:start position:0%
year the other the other indirect uh
 
00:32:35.389 --> 00:32:35.399 align:start position:0%
effect of having an IMD waiver is that
 
00:32:38.590 --> 00:32:38.600 align:start position:0%
it allows us to attract and to to
 
00:32:42.430 --> 00:32:42.440 align:start position:0%
partner with other um inpatient Partners
 
00:32:45.029 --> 00:32:45.039 align:start position:0%
so right now we have New Hampshire
 
00:32:46.870 --> 00:32:46.880 align:start position:0%
hospital and some drfs scattered
 
00:32:49.389 --> 00:32:49.399 align:start position:0%
throughout the state many states have
 
00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
inpatient providers that are outside of
 
00:32:54.029 --> 00:32:54.039 align:start position:0%
the state system that run you know pool
 
00:32:56.789 --> 00:32:56.799 align:start position:0%
psychiatric hospitals no one um no
 
00:32:58.029 --> 00:32:58.039 align:start position:0%
company is going to be willing willing
 
00:32:59.950 --> 00:32:59.960 align:start position:0%
to come to New Hampshire without this
 
00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
IMD waiver so this this hopefully is
 
00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:05.240 align:start position:0%
going to be the start of finding a new
 
00:33:08.909 --> 00:33:08.919 align:start position:0%
partner representative Edwards thank you
 
00:33:10.830 --> 00:33:10.840 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to find the most graceful way
 
00:33:12.909 --> 00:33:12.919 align:start position:0%
to interrupt you uh we got a question
 
00:33:16.750 --> 00:33:16.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
Earth commissioner are we gonna get a
 
00:33:21.509 --> 00:33:21.519 align:start position:0%
copy of that
 
00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:24.880 align:start position:0%
review yes yes um I do believe it is
 
00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:27.240 align:start position:0%
going to be released publicly if not the
 
00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
end of this than early next week thank
 
00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:32.430 align:start position:0%
end of this than early next week thank
you

00:33:32.430 --> 00:33:32.440 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:33:36.110 --> 00:33:36.120 align:start position:0%
y um so that's IMD waiver uh critical
 
00:33:38.669 --> 00:33:38.679 align:start position:0%
time intervention also called CTI is
 
00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:41.200 align:start position:0%
something that uh that came out of this
 
00:33:44.789 --> 00:33:44.799 align:start position:0%
review and what CTI is it's a
 
00:33:47.710 --> 00:33:47.720 align:start position:0%
evidence-based PR uh program for people
 
00:33:50.470 --> 00:33:50.480 align:start position:0%
that have mental illness that is that is
 
00:33:52.710 --> 00:33:52.720 align:start position:0%
done to reduce readmission rates to
 
00:33:55.070 --> 00:33:55.080 align:start position:0%
hospital this is something that uh I'm
 
00:33:57.230 --> 00:33:57.240 align:start position:0%
actually very excited about most most of
 
00:33:59.870 --> 00:33:59.880 align:start position:0%
you know I'm a big proponent of our
 
00:34:01.669 --> 00:34:01.679 align:start position:0%
mental health system after spending a
 
00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
couple of years at New Hampshire
 
00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
hospital critical time intervention is a
 
00:34:08.349 --> 00:34:08.359 align:start position:0%
program that is used in other states
 
00:34:11.069 --> 00:34:11.079 align:start position:0%
that start prior to the discharge from a
 
00:34:14.109 --> 00:34:14.119 align:start position:0%
hospital and goes through nine months
 
00:34:16.829 --> 00:34:16.839 align:start position:0%
and it is very uh the Fidelity to this
 
00:34:19.629 --> 00:34:19.639 align:start position:0%
program is very important it is a step
 
00:34:22.069 --> 00:34:22.079 align:start position:0%
down from right now we have act Services
 
00:34:24.149 --> 00:34:24.159 align:start position:0%
which is a very high-intensity labor
 
00:34:28.109 --> 00:34:28.119 align:start position:0%
intensive team approach to care CTI ey
 
00:34:30.790 --> 00:34:30.800 align:start position:0%
is probably a step down from that it is
 
00:34:33.909 --> 00:34:33.919 align:start position:0%
not as intense but it can be it can be
 
00:34:36.629 --> 00:34:36.639 align:start position:0%
structured to meet any need of of a
 
00:34:38.430 --> 00:34:38.440 align:start position:0%
client coming out of the hospital and
 
00:34:40.629 --> 00:34:40.639 align:start position:0%
what I really love about this program is
 
00:34:43.430 --> 00:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
it requires the community provider to
 
00:34:47.669 --> 00:34:47.679 align:start position:0%
engage the patient and the hospital for
 
00:34:49.550 --> 00:34:49.560 align:start position:0%
discharge from the hospital which which
 
00:34:51.389 --> 00:34:51.399 align:start position:0%
we believe is very important to have a
 
00:34:53.829 --> 00:34:53.839 align:start position:0%
warm handoff or a very smooth transition
 
00:34:57.430 --> 00:34:57.440 align:start position:0%
of care so this program is going to be
 
00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:58.630 align:start position:0%
of care so this program is going to be
um

00:34:58.630 --> 00:34:58.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:00.550 --> 00:35:00.560 align:start position:0%
really Central to a lot of what we're
 
00:35:03.910 --> 00:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
doing this year we'll be recruiting for
 
00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:06.560 align:start position:0%
uh CTI Specialists we will be doing
 
00:35:09.150 --> 00:35:09.160 align:start position:0%
certification and training for our state
 
00:35:11.470 --> 00:35:11.480 align:start position:0%
both uh state employees and our
 
00:35:14.349 --> 00:35:14.359 align:start position:0%
community providers um very excited
 
00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
about this program the developmental
 
00:35:19.829 --> 00:35:19.839 align:start position:0%
disability system definitely had a lot
 
00:35:23.349 --> 00:35:23.359 align:start position:0%
of focus in this review and really what
 
00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:26.240 align:start position:0%
came out of this system uh this review
 
00:35:29.310 --> 00:35:29.320 align:start position:0%
is the ability to structure our DD
 
00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
waiver in a way that better matches a
 
00:35:36.589 --> 00:35:36.599 align:start position:0%
person's needs to their services um and
 
00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:38.960 align:start position:0%
and in doing that ensuring that we have
 
00:35:41.069 --> 00:35:41.079 align:start position:0%
the full Continuum of Care here in New
 
00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:43.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire one of the things that that I
 
00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
saw when I was at New Hampshire hospital
 
00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
and even you know as commissioner is
 
00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
that some of our clients that that
 
00:35:52.309 --> 00:35:52.319 align:start position:0%
require the highest level of care the
 
00:35:54.309 --> 00:35:54.319 align:start position:0%
Residential Care in a very structured
 
00:35:56.349 --> 00:35:56.359 align:start position:0%
safe environment that that are on the DD
 
00:35:58.790 --> 00:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
waiver end up needing to go out of state
 
00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:01.800 align:start position:0%
for these services and it is uh my
 
00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
opinion and and A&amp;M agrees with me and I
 
00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:06.880 align:start position:0%
think most of you would agree with me is
 
00:36:10.270 --> 00:36:10.280 align:start position:0%
that taking a a patient that has natural
 
00:36:12.109 --> 00:36:12.119 align:start position:0%
supports in the communities families
 
00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
friends and moving them to another state
 
00:36:16.750 --> 00:36:16.760 align:start position:0%
is not what's best for our citizens so
 
00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we will be doing
 
00:36:20.829 --> 00:36:20.839 align:start position:0%
around the DD system is really looking
 
00:36:24.309 --> 00:36:24.319 align:start position:0%
at how we how we create eligibility and
 
00:36:26.990 --> 00:36:27.000 align:start position:0%
structure the system so that we match
 
00:36:28.870 --> 00:36:28.880 align:start position:0%
better what the needs are with the what
 
00:36:30.589 --> 00:36:30.599 align:start position:0%
the services and then make sure we have
 
00:36:33.829 --> 00:36:33.839 align:start position:0%
all the services in our state and then
 
00:36:37.109 --> 00:36:37.119 align:start position:0%
one of the big uh projects that we have
 
00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:39.680 align:start position:0%
going on at the department is mmis which
 
00:36:44.109 --> 00:36:44.119 align:start position:0%
is our Medicaid system this has been um
 
00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:46.480 align:start position:0%
on our docket and in our capital budget
 
00:36:49.829 --> 00:36:49.839 align:start position:0%
now for years I would say several bium
 
00:36:51.150 --> 00:36:51.160 align:start position:0%
that we need to invest in the
 
00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:54.560 align:start position:0%
infrastructure of the mmis system we are
 
00:36:56.069 --> 00:36:56.079 align:start position:0%
going to start incurring Federal
 
00:36:58.109 --> 00:36:58.119 align:start position:0%
penalties if we don't get this system up
 
00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:00.720 align:start position:0%
to date it is a very long transition
 
00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:03.280 align:start position:0%
it's probably going to take 8 to 10
 
00:37:06.870 --> 00:37:06.880 align:start position:0%
years from the time of starting to
 
00:37:10.309 --> 00:37:10.319 align:start position:0%
procure it to all to having all of the
 
00:37:13.829 --> 00:37:13.839 align:start position:0%
different uh modular systems in place so
 
00:37:17.309 --> 00:37:17.319 align:start position:0%
starting starting that process of really
 
00:37:21.190 --> 00:37:21.200 align:start position:0%
um honing in on the Mi mmis system and
 
00:37:23.150 --> 00:37:23.160 align:start position:0%
getting it up to date and in compliance
 
00:37:25.829 --> 00:37:25.839 align:start position:0%
with Federal Regulations is going to be
 
00:37:28.150 --> 00:37:28.160 align:start position:0%
a focus
 
00:37:31.589 --> 00:37:31.599 align:start position:0%
so that ends my overview of what you're
 
00:37:33.589 --> 00:37:33.599 align:start position:0%
going to hear for the next several hours
 
00:37:35.829 --> 00:37:35.839 align:start position:0%
so I want to stop there before Karen
 
00:37:40.390 --> 00:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
takes over and just answer any questions
 
00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
that uh any of the committee members may
 
00:37:46.150 --> 00:37:46.160 align:start position:0%
have about the department or what we
 
00:37:49.230 --> 00:37:49.240 align:start position:0%
do thank you so much uh this slide does
 
00:37:51.510 --> 00:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
trigger a couple of questions it sounds
 
00:37:55.270 --> 00:37:55.280 align:start position:0%
like under your new view of of how you
 
00:37:57.990 --> 00:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
might change services in the D
 
00:38:01.150 --> 00:38:01.160 align:start position:0%
area that there's going to be some
 
00:38:05.470 --> 00:38:05.480 align:start position:0%
fairly uh Rich family counseling to make
 
00:38:08.589 --> 00:38:08.599 align:start position:0%
sure that uh the needs of of the
 
00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
disabled are met and what I'm curious
 
00:38:15.630 --> 00:38:15.640 align:start position:0%
about is if there's going to be an
 
00:38:19.150 --> 00:38:19.160 align:start position:0%
opportunity to coordinate with other
 
00:38:21.190 --> 00:38:21.200 align:start position:0%
agents that you may be sending into the
 
00:38:24.829 --> 00:38:24.839 align:start position:0%
field to do to handle other social
 
00:38:27.670 --> 00:38:27.680 align:start position:0%
determinants of Health um so that we
 
00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
don't have two three four different uh
 
00:38:35.190 --> 00:38:35.200 align:start position:0%
client contact points when it would be
 
00:38:37.510 --> 00:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
maybe more efficient to have one have
 
00:38:40.990 --> 00:38:41.000 align:start position:0%
you uh have you have you is that a
 
00:38:43.510 --> 00:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
problem now that we have many contact
 
00:38:45.030 --> 00:38:45.040 align:start position:0%
points for
 
00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:47.680 align:start position:0%
multiple uh social
 
00:38:50.430 --> 00:38:50.440 align:start position:0%
determinants yes so it is a problem and
 
00:38:52.309 --> 00:38:52.319 align:start position:0%
and I'm glad that that you asked this
 
00:38:54.750 --> 00:38:54.760 align:start position:0%
question because what you're seeing here
 
00:38:56.829 --> 00:38:56.839 align:start position:0%
is a precursor to exactly what you're
 
00:38:58.829 --> 00:38:58.839 align:start position:0%
talking about which is full integration
 
00:39:00.910 --> 00:39:00.920 align:start position:0%
of all of our service delivery lines
 
00:39:03.150 --> 00:39:03.160 align:start position:0%
right what we want to be able to do is
 
00:39:05.430 --> 00:39:05.440 align:start position:0%
provide whole family case management or
 
00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:08.720 align:start position:0%
care coordination so if if we have a
 
00:39:11.069 --> 00:39:11.079 align:start position:0%
vulnerable family that has someone on
 
00:39:14.270 --> 00:39:14.280 align:start position:0%
the DD waiver someone with mental health
 
00:39:18.309 --> 00:39:18.319 align:start position:0%
um mental illness uh you know a senior
 
00:39:21.710 --> 00:39:21.720 align:start position:0%
uh someone involved with child uh dcyf
 
00:39:24.990 --> 00:39:25.000 align:start position:0%
that we have a care coordinators that
 
00:39:27.390 --> 00:39:27.400 align:start position:0%
can go in and take care of the entire
 
00:39:29.390 --> 00:39:29.400 align:start position:0%
family instead of them having four or
 
00:39:30.790 --> 00:39:30.800 align:start position:0%
five different touch points with the
 
00:39:32.910 --> 00:39:32.920 align:start position:0%
Department that's where we're heading
 
00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
the long-term vision is exactly what
 
00:39:36.150 --> 00:39:36.160 align:start position:0%
you're talking about representative
 
00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:38.240 align:start position:0%
Edwards that we're we're shooting for
 
00:39:40.030 --> 00:39:40.040 align:start position:0%
and some of the things that we're doing
 
00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:42.720 align:start position:0%
right now in for the next two years is
 
00:39:45.950 --> 00:39:45.960 align:start position:0%
teeing that up to look at that that that
 
00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
integrated model in the department um
 
00:39:53.710 --> 00:39:53.720 align:start position:0%
the the journey to get to whole family
 
00:39:56.589 --> 00:39:56.599 align:start position:0%
case management and care coordination uh
 
00:39:59.550 --> 00:39:59.560 align:start position:0%
a health home home or some type of model
 
00:40:01.829 --> 00:40:01.839 align:start position:0%
that allows us to take the whole family
 
00:40:05.109 --> 00:40:05.119 align:start position:0%
as a unit versus several touch points is
 
00:40:09.589 --> 00:40:09.599 align:start position:0%
a multi- banum project it is not it is
 
00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
not it's not something that can be
 
00:40:13.270 --> 00:40:13.280 align:start position:0%
accomplished in two years because part
 
00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
part of the issue is that the department
 
00:40:17.950 --> 00:40:17.960 align:start position:0%
has structured a lot of their programs
 
00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
around Federal funding the federal the
 
00:40:23.390 --> 00:40:23.400 align:start position:0%
federal government funds this part so we
 
00:40:25.230 --> 00:40:25.240 align:start position:0%
develop a program to capture that
 
00:40:27.990 --> 00:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
Federal funding um we need to change
 
00:40:30.030 --> 00:40:30.040 align:start position:0%
that up but we do need to align the
 
00:40:32.109 --> 00:40:32.119 align:start position:0%
federal programs with our state programs
 
00:40:33.790 --> 00:40:33.800 align:start position:0%
so this is part of what we're doing to
 
00:40:36.630 --> 00:40:36.640 align:start position:0%
get to exactly what you're talking about
 
00:40:39.950 --> 00:40:39.960 align:start position:0%
okay so that leads into the mmis I I had
 
00:40:41.910 --> 00:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
a trivia question of whether or not the
 
00:40:44.190 --> 00:40:44.200 align:start position:0%
mpti index is going to be in there or
 
00:40:46.309 --> 00:40:46.319 align:start position:0%
not but but probably the more
 
00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:50.800 align:start position:0%
significant question is uh is is this
 
00:40:56.030 --> 00:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
the Mi mmis going to um specifically be
 
00:40:58.630 --> 00:40:58.640 align:start position:0%
tailored so it's featur teachers support
 
00:41:01.230 --> 00:41:01.240 align:start position:0%
this integrated approach or are you
 
00:41:03.230 --> 00:41:03.240 align:start position:0%
going to be fighting the information
 
00:41:07.470 --> 00:41:07.480 align:start position:0%
system to help you do the care that you
 
00:41:10.870 --> 00:41:10.880 align:start position:0%
want um I think that updating mmis is
 
00:41:13.150 --> 00:41:13.160 align:start position:0%
going to help with the integration of
 
00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
the department overall I think a
 
00:41:17.670 --> 00:41:17.680 align:start position:0%
specific question to that end is
 
00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
probably best directed at Dave leers who
 
00:41:21.950 --> 00:41:21.960 align:start position:0%
will be on later in the program and talk
 
00:41:24.349 --> 00:41:24.359 align:start position:0%
about mmis in detail about what we're
 
00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
going to be doing okay that's that's
 
00:41:28.990 --> 00:41:29.000 align:start position:0%
fair I I just want to leave you with the
 
00:41:30.750 --> 00:41:30.760 align:start position:0%
idea that I I hope if we're going to
 
00:41:33.150 --> 00:41:33.160 align:start position:0%
take 10 years to procure a system it
 
00:41:36.309 --> 00:41:36.319 align:start position:0%
supports your vision of an integrated uh
 
00:41:37.990 --> 00:41:38.000 align:start position:0%
family touch
 
00:41:40.470 --> 00:41:40.480 align:start position:0%
point I think the the the best thing
 
00:41:43.589 --> 00:41:43.599 align:start position:0%
about the way we're procuring mmis is
 
00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:46.480 align:start position:0%
we're doing it in a modular fashion so
 
00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
that when we when we change something in
 
00:41:51.390 --> 00:41:51.400 align:start position:0%
our state we don't have to throw it the
 
00:41:53.470 --> 00:41:53.480 align:start position:0%
whole system because it's done in
 
00:41:55.550 --> 00:41:55.560 align:start position:0%
modulars we only have we would only have
 
00:41:57.829 --> 00:41:57.839 align:start position:0%
to change one modular if we change even
 
00:41:59.790 --> 00:41:59.800 align:start position:0%
if State Law changes or something like
 
00:42:02.230 --> 00:42:02.240 align:start position:0%
that um and that is why one of the
 
00:42:04.150 --> 00:42:04.160 align:start position:0%
reasons why we're doing this is that it
 
00:42:06.790 --> 00:42:06.800 align:start position:0%
allows for those subtle changes to be
 
00:42:10.430 --> 00:42:10.440 align:start position:0%
made without without needing to comp do
 
00:42:13.829 --> 00:42:13.839 align:start position:0%
a complete overhaul of the entire
 
00:42:17.670 --> 00:42:17.680 align:start position:0%
system great um are there any other
 
00:42:21.309 --> 00:42:21.319 align:start position:0%
questions anyone so I I want to thank
 
00:42:23.150 --> 00:42:23.160 align:start position:0%
you I want to let you know that if you
 
00:42:26.190 --> 00:42:26.200 align:start position:0%
need some uh legislative support in your
 
00:42:28.030 --> 00:42:28.040 align:start position:0%
transformation process that you're
 
00:42:30.589 --> 00:42:30.599 align:start position:0%
seeing some roadblocks to keep you from
 
00:42:32.589 --> 00:42:32.599 align:start position:0%
doing things smarter and making things
 
00:42:35.710 --> 00:42:35.720 align:start position:0%
better for New Hampshire um you know
 
00:42:37.829 --> 00:42:37.839 align:start position:0%
look at us as allies too and not just
 
00:42:39.750 --> 00:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
the people trying to cut your
 
00:42:42.910 --> 00:42:42.920 align:start position:0%
budget thank you appreciate
 
00:42:44.710 --> 00:42:44.720 align:start position:0%
it all
 
00:42:51.829 --> 00:42:51.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:55.270 --> 00:42:55.280 align:start position:0%
Karen thank you so this slide here um is
 
00:42:57.230 --> 00:42:57.240 align:start position:0%
really just a preview for what you're
 
00:42:59.430 --> 00:42:59.440 align:start position:0%
going to see from uh lots of the
 
00:43:01.790 --> 00:43:01.800 align:start position:0%
divisions um and just to hit some of
 
00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
this on a high level as the commissioner
 
00:43:05.950 --> 00:43:05.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned the Medicaid case loads are
 
00:43:08.510 --> 00:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
higher because of the requirements to
 
00:43:11.670 --> 00:43:11.680 align:start position:0%
receive the enhanced fmap um TANF
 
00:43:14.349 --> 00:43:14.359 align:start position:0%
continues to stay steady uh we believe
 
00:43:17.230 --> 00:43:17.240 align:start position:0%
that's partially due to the additional
 
00:43:19.990 --> 00:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits that are available
 
00:43:22.430 --> 00:43:22.440 align:start position:0%
um yes representative
 
00:43:26.349 --> 00:43:26.359 align:start position:0%
Edwards so be gentle with us with your
 
00:43:26.359 --> 00:43:27.710 align:start position:0%
Edwards so be gentle with us with your
acronyms

00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:27.720 align:start position:0%
acronyms
 
00:43:29.750 --> 00:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
like the first because because I think
 
00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
you just stuck two of them in my eye
 
00:43:35.150 --> 00:43:35.160 align:start position:0%
right there so sorry about that that's
 
00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:36.190 align:start position:0%
right there so sorry about that that's
all

00:43:36.190 --> 00:43:36.200 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:43:39.109 --> 00:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
right so
 
00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
um TANF is uh temporary assistance for
 
00:43:45.349 --> 00:43:45.359 align:start position:0%
needy families it's a program that Chris
 
00:43:47.470 --> 00:43:47.480 align:start position:0%
santanello will explain in her
 
00:43:49.549 --> 00:43:49.559 align:start position:0%
presentation um for the division of
 
00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
Economic and housing stability um that
 
00:43:54.750 --> 00:43:54.760 align:start position:0%
program like I mentioned has stayed
 
00:43:57.950 --> 00:43:57.960 align:start position:0%
fairly steady um we believe because
 
00:43:59.670 --> 00:43:59.680 align:start position:0%
partially because of the additional
 
00:44:01.790 --> 00:44:01.800 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits that are available
 
00:44:03.069 --> 00:44:03.079 align:start position:0%
during the
 
00:44:07.510 --> 00:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
pandemic um the same is true of
 
00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:09.549 align:start position:0%
pandemic um the same is true of
APD

00:44:09.549 --> 00:44:09.559 align:start position:0%
APD
 
00:44:12.670 --> 00:44:12.680 align:start position:0%
um and I always forget what This Acronym
 
00:44:15.349 --> 00:44:15.359 align:start position:0%
is so I'm sorry I do know I believe
 
00:44:17.990 --> 00:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
Kevin provided the list of acronyms
 
00:44:19.630 --> 00:44:19.640 align:start position:0%
which I'm sure are very overwhelming I
 
00:44:21.670 --> 00:44:21.680 align:start position:0%
believe it's something like 40 pages of
 
00:44:24.190 --> 00:44:24.200 align:start position:0%
acronyms that we use at our department
 
00:44:26.589 --> 00:44:26.599 align:start position:0%
um so it is very overwhelming I do
 
00:44:26.599 --> 00:44:27.870 align:start position:0%
um so it is very overwhelming I do
understand

00:44:27.870 --> 00:44:27.880 align:start position:0%
understand
 
00:44:30.069 --> 00:44:30.079 align:start position:0%
so that's aid for the permanently and
 
00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
totally disabled thank you commissioner
 
00:44:36.190 --> 00:44:36.200 align:start position:0%
I don't know why I always forget that
 
00:44:38.910 --> 00:44:38.920 align:start position:0%
one I think we're going to have to form
 
00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
the dark the department acronym
 
00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:42.220 align:start position:0%
the dark the department acronym
reduction

00:44:42.220 --> 00:44:42.230 align:start position:0%
reduction
 
00:44:42.230 --> 00:44:44.510 align:start position:0%
reduction
[Laughter]

00:44:44.510 --> 00:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:44:47.870 --> 00:44:47.880 align:start position:0%
committee um and snap which is otherwise
 
00:44:50.710 --> 00:44:50.720 align:start position:0%
known as food stamps also um continues
 
00:44:52.950 --> 00:44:52.960 align:start position:0%
on a dowbor trend for the last many
 
00:44:56.670 --> 00:44:56.680 align:start position:0%
years part of that uh is related to if
 
00:45:00.750 --> 00:45:00.760 align:start position:0%
you look look at 2017 to 2018 there was
 
00:45:03.349 --> 00:45:03.359 align:start position:0%
an increase in tanif there was a change
 
00:45:06.270 --> 00:45:06.280 align:start position:0%
in eligibility um during the legislative
 
00:45:10.150 --> 00:45:10.160 align:start position:0%
session that increased the um benefit
 
00:45:11.790 --> 00:45:11.800 align:start position:0%
and the number of people that are
 
00:45:14.190 --> 00:45:14.200 align:start position:0%
eligible which also then decrease the
 
00:45:16.069 --> 00:45:16.079 align:start position:0%
number of people eligible for
 
00:45:19.549 --> 00:45:19.559 align:start position:0%
SNAP so like I mentioned uh Henry Litman
 
00:45:21.870 --> 00:45:21.880 align:start position:0%
in Medicaid will certainly spend a lot
 
00:45:24.750 --> 00:45:24.760 align:start position:0%
more time on the case loads for Medicaid
 
00:45:28.349 --> 00:45:28.359 align:start position:0%
uh long-term care is what LTC is and Deb
 
00:45:30.670 --> 00:45:30.680 align:start position:0%
sheets will cover more of that in Long
 
00:45:32.990 --> 00:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
in her long-term supports and services
 
00:45:35.190 --> 00:45:35.200 align:start position:0%
presentation and the last three Chris
 
00:45:38.870 --> 00:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
santinello will cover in dehs which is
 
00:45:45.549 --> 00:45:45.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:47.589 --> 00:45:47.599 align:start position:0%
week I wanted to talk to you a little
 
00:45:49.630 --> 00:45:49.640 align:start position:0%
bit about budgeting those of you who
 
00:45:51.870 --> 00:45:51.880 align:start position:0%
have been on the committee are familiar
 
00:45:55.430 --> 00:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
with my diagram um this was something
 
00:45:58.390 --> 00:45:58.400 align:start position:0%
that Mary kiss and I created when I came
 
00:46:01.750 --> 00:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
on board to help un people understand
 
00:46:04.710 --> 00:46:04.720 align:start position:0%
how things work for DHHS because for a
 
00:46:06.870 --> 00:46:06.880 align:start position:0%
lot of agencies there's just budget and
 
00:46:09.829 --> 00:46:09.839 align:start position:0%
actual and for our department there's
 
00:46:12.670 --> 00:46:12.680 align:start position:0%
also something called C cost
 
00:46:14.910 --> 00:46:14.920 align:start position:0%
allocation cost allocation is a
 
00:46:18.470 --> 00:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
federally required uh mechanism we have
 
00:46:22.990 --> 00:46:23.000 align:start position:0%
a um what is called a payap pacap which
 
00:46:25.670 --> 00:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
is public assistance cost allocation
 
00:46:29.390 --> 00:46:29.400 align:start position:0%
plan that is federally required to uh
 
00:46:32.870 --> 00:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
determine how our expenditures are paid
 
00:46:35.109 --> 00:46:35.119 align:start position:0%
throughout the department and each of
 
00:46:37.630 --> 00:46:37.640 align:start position:0%
these three things uh intersect in
 
00:46:42.069 --> 00:46:42.079 align:start position:0%
different ways budget to actual um that
 
00:46:43.790 --> 00:46:43.800 align:start position:0%
typically the interaction there is that
 
00:46:45.309 --> 00:46:45.319 align:start position:0%
there is some kind of lapse at the end
 
00:46:48.230 --> 00:46:48.240 align:start position:0%
of the year um cost allocation to
 
00:46:50.870 --> 00:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
actuals there are typically adjustments
 
00:46:54.270 --> 00:46:54.280 align:start position:0%
so we may have budgeted it um one way
 
00:46:57.549 --> 00:46:57.559 align:start position:0%
and then later on uh realize that the
 
00:47:00.030 --> 00:47:00.040 align:start position:0%
earn is a little bit different and then
 
00:47:01.950 --> 00:47:01.960 align:start position:0%
budget to cost allocation is how we are
 
00:47:03.710 --> 00:47:03.720 align:start position:0%
doing our Revenue estimates and of
 
00:47:05.950 --> 00:47:05.960 align:start position:0%
course the intersection of all that is
 
00:47:07.950 --> 00:47:07.960 align:start position:0%
reporting uh just to give you a little
 
00:47:10.390 --> 00:47:10.400 align:start position:0%
bit of an example from cost
 
00:47:13.230 --> 00:47:13.240 align:start position:0%
allocation we have about 200 different
 
00:47:16.549 --> 00:47:16.559 align:start position:0%
Revenue sources in the department um the
 
00:47:18.990 --> 00:47:19.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner myself anyone at a senior
 
00:47:21.109 --> 00:47:21.119 align:start position:0%
management level is paid by virtually
 
00:47:24.510 --> 00:47:24.520 align:start position:0%
all of those 200 different sources so my
 
00:47:29.030 --> 00:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
salary may be made up of you know $3 of
 
00:47:32.549 --> 00:47:32.559 align:start position:0%
one type of program um but that is
 
00:47:40.309 --> 00:47:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:43.589 --> 00:47:43.599 align:start position:0%
plan the briefing book that the chair
 
00:47:46.510 --> 00:47:46.520 align:start position:0%
was speaking about earlier um I will
 
00:47:49.069 --> 00:47:49.079 align:start position:0%
have that to you uh it looks like
 
00:47:52.870 --> 00:47:52.880 align:start position:0%
tomorrow which is great um but this I
 
00:47:54.390 --> 00:47:54.400 align:start position:0%
wanted to just give you a sense of what
 
00:47:56.790 --> 00:47:56.800 align:start position:0%
you're going to see in this document you
 
00:47:58.950 --> 00:47:58.960 align:start position:0%
you will see one of these charts here
 
00:48:01.510 --> 00:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
for every accounting unit that is
 
00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:04.240 align:start position:0%
greater than a million dollars um so
 
00:48:06.790 --> 00:48:06.800 align:start position:0%
we'll give you the fiscal 20 actuals the
 
00:48:11.030 --> 00:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 21 adjusted authorized uh
 
00:48:14.150 --> 00:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
the agency request for 22 and 23 and the
 
00:48:16.510 --> 00:48:16.520 align:start position:0%
governor budget for 22 and
 
00:48:19.990 --> 00:48:20.000 align:start position:0%
23 each of the accounting uh units also
 
00:48:24.349 --> 00:48:24.359 align:start position:0%
has a uh written information which
 
00:48:26.270 --> 00:48:26.280 align:start position:0%
includes uh what I've listed there at
 
00:48:28.390 --> 00:48:28.400 align:start position:0%
the bottom of the Slide the purpose the
 
00:48:30.549 --> 00:48:30.559 align:start position:0%
client profile Financial summary which
 
00:48:33.430 --> 00:48:33.440 align:start position:0%
is what is shown above funding sources
 
00:48:36.910 --> 00:48:36.920 align:start position:0%
so um like I mentioned earlier you know
 
00:48:38.630 --> 00:48:38.640 align:start position:0%
it lists that there are many funding
 
00:48:40.910 --> 00:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
sources uh in the office of the
 
00:48:43.309 --> 00:48:43.319 align:start position:0%
commissioner State mandates and federal
 
00:48:45.150 --> 00:48:45.160 align:start position:0%
Mand mandates which goes back to what
 
00:48:47.630 --> 00:48:47.640 align:start position:0%
you were asking about earlier chair
 
00:48:50.150 --> 00:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
about um you know which missions are
 
00:48:52.789 --> 00:48:52.799 align:start position:0%
required by law um you would see those
 
00:48:55.510 --> 00:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
for those largest accounting units the
 
00:48:58.750 --> 00:48:58.760 align:start position:0%
services that are provided how they're
 
00:49:01.750 --> 00:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
provided and our expected
 
00:49:04.430 --> 00:49:04.440 align:start position:0%
outcomes so it's quite a detailed book I
 
00:49:06.150 --> 00:49:06.160 align:start position:0%
don't remember how many pages it is this
 
00:49:12.950 --> 00:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:17.589 --> 00:49:17.599 align:start position:0%
200 yes representative Edwards thank you
 
00:49:21.270 --> 00:49:21.280 align:start position:0%
I um uh Mr Ripple and I had been talking
 
00:49:25.150 --> 00:49:25.160 align:start position:0%
in background about uh adding two prior
 
00:49:28.710 --> 00:49:28.720 align:start position:0%
fiscal years to it 18 18 and 19 so that
 
00:49:31.069 --> 00:49:31.079 align:start position:0%
there's a little bit more of a running
 
00:49:35.309 --> 00:49:35.319 align:start position:0%
Trend um to to to give context to the
 
00:49:39.069 --> 00:49:39.079 align:start position:0%
numbers to the right yes how how might
 
00:49:41.510 --> 00:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
that happen will that happen or or or
 
00:49:44.710 --> 00:49:44.720 align:start position:0%
not yes so uh it will not be in the
 
00:49:46.789 --> 00:49:46.799 align:start position:0%
briefing book but what what I do have
 
00:49:50.390 --> 00:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
for you and we I think we'll have that
 
00:49:55.270 --> 00:49:55.280 align:start position:0%
done Tuesday if I remember correctly um
 
00:49:57.150 --> 00:49:57.160 align:start position:0%
is I will have a spreadsheet for you an
 
00:49:59.870 --> 00:49:59.880 align:start position:0%
Excel document I'll provide it in Excel
 
00:50:04.150 --> 00:50:04.160 align:start position:0%
that has fiscal year 18 19 and 20
 
00:50:07.270 --> 00:50:07.280 align:start position:0%
actuals fiscal year 21 budget or
 
00:50:10.309 --> 00:50:10.319 align:start position:0%
adjusted authorized and then agency and
 
00:50:12.549 --> 00:50:12.559 align:start position:0%
Governor excuse me just to give you a
 
00:50:16.510 --> 00:50:16.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:20.910 --> 00:50:20.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
you excuse
 
00:50:26.309 --> 00:50:26.319 align:start position:0%
me so this is meant to just give you a
 
00:50:29.829 --> 00:50:29.839 align:start position:0%
highlight sense of the budgets by
 
00:50:37.549 --> 00:50:37.559 align:start position:0%
division and um again only has uh 21 22
 
00:50:41.190 --> 00:50:41.200 align:start position:0%
23 uh the division names I did shorten
 
00:50:43.390 --> 00:50:43.400 align:start position:0%
there just so that we could fit all of
 
00:50:45.470 --> 00:50:45.480 align:start position:0%
the numbers on the
 
00:50:47.390 --> 00:50:47.400 align:start position:0%
page excuse
 
00:50:52.510 --> 00:50:52.520 align:start position:0%
me um so starting at uh the first one
 
00:50:54.990 --> 00:50:55.000 align:start position:0%
there that's the division for Behavioral
 
00:50:58.549 --> 00:50:58.559 align:start position:0%
Health um
 
00:51:01.230 --> 00:51:01.240 align:start position:0%
the the budget here from the agency
 
00:51:02.950 --> 00:51:02.960 align:start position:0%
phase to the governor's phase actually
 
00:51:06.549 --> 00:51:06.559 align:start position:0%
increased there was a program um that
 
00:51:08.710 --> 00:51:08.720 align:start position:0%
did not get budgeted in the agency phase
 
00:51:10.710 --> 00:51:10.720 align:start position:0%
that was overlooked that the governor
 
00:51:14.430 --> 00:51:14.440 align:start position:0%
kindly added um back into the
 
00:51:19.150 --> 00:51:19.160 align:start position:0%
budget dcyf the uh the reduction you see
 
00:51:25.230 --> 00:51:25.240 align:start position:0%
here is uh primarily due to um well the
 
00:51:27.950 --> 00:51:27.960 align:start position:0%
overall reduction that you're seeing
 
00:51:31.710 --> 00:51:31.720 align:start position:0%
from 163 million down to 136 million is
 
00:51:34.710 --> 00:51:34.720 align:start position:0%
not a reduction to the dcyf budget we
 
00:51:37.549 --> 00:51:37.559 align:start position:0%
moved the Medicaid expenditures so kids
 
00:51:39.750 --> 00:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
who are in out of home placement that
 
00:51:42.789 --> 00:51:42.799 align:start position:0%
qualify for Medicaid previously we put
 
00:51:45.470 --> 00:51:45.480 align:start position:0%
those Medicaid expenditures in the dcyf
 
00:51:49.589 --> 00:51:49.599 align:start position:0%
budget to um to put all of the Medicaid
 
00:51:52.510 --> 00:51:52.520 align:start position:0%
expenditures together um made a lot more
 
00:51:54.549 --> 00:51:54.559 align:start position:0%
sense so those expenditures are now
 
00:51:57.309 --> 00:51:57.319 align:start position:0%
within the Medicaid budget so will see
 
00:51:59.190 --> 00:51:59.200 align:start position:0%
that corresponding increase over in the
 
00:52:02.309 --> 00:52:02.319 align:start position:0%
Medicaid budget um from that change yes
 
00:52:02.319 --> 00:52:03.870 align:start position:0%
Medicaid budget um from that change yes
representative

00:52:03.870 --> 00:52:03.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:52:06.670 --> 00:52:06.680 align:start position:0%
Edwards so are you able to move your
 
00:52:09.470 --> 00:52:09.480 align:start position:0%
mouse around to show us what cell you're
 
00:52:12.870 --> 00:52:12.880 align:start position:0%
talking about at each yes I can do that
 
00:52:17.589 --> 00:52:17.599 align:start position:0%
um yeah this 163 million to 136 million
 
00:52:19.870 --> 00:52:19.880 align:start position:0%
here and the other thing I would mention
 
00:52:21.710 --> 00:52:21.720 align:start position:0%
is this is meant to just be very high
 
00:52:23.750 --> 00:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
level each of the divisions of course we
 
00:52:26.150 --> 00:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
we'll de dive into all of these numbers
 
00:52:27.590 --> 00:52:27.600 align:start position:0%
with you
 
00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:29.549 align:start position:0%
with you
[Music]

00:52:29.549 --> 00:52:29.559 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
so this you know $30 million reduction
 
00:52:34.990 --> 00:52:35.000 align:start position:0%
in the DCF budget is not truly a
 
00:52:37.549 --> 00:52:37.559 align:start position:0%
reduction it is just moving the Medicaid
 
00:52:41.150 --> 00:52:41.160 align:start position:0%
expenditures from the DCF budget to the
 
00:52:43.910 --> 00:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
Medicaid budget which is down here so
 
00:52:45.589 --> 00:52:45.599 align:start position:0%
you see there's actually about a $50
 
00:52:47.230 --> 00:52:47.240 align:start position:0%
million increase and part of that
 
00:52:50.670 --> 00:52:50.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:53.870 --> 00:52:53.880 align:start position:0%
moved the reduction from the agency
 
00:52:57.150 --> 00:52:57.160 align:start position:0%
phase to the governor's phase
 
00:53:02.069 --> 00:53:02.079 align:start position:0%
um was a reduction in funded positions
 
00:53:04.030 --> 00:53:04.040 align:start position:0%
um there were about
 
00:53:08.190 --> 00:53:08.200 align:start position:0%
20ish uh cpsw positions that were
 
00:53:14.630 --> 00:53:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:18.349 --> 00:53:18.359 align:start position:0%
vacancies economic and housing
 
00:53:21.549 --> 00:53:21.559 align:start position:0%
stability um there's not a lot of change
 
00:53:23.150 --> 00:53:23.160 align:start position:0%
in this budget there were some minor
 
00:53:24.910 --> 00:53:24.920 align:start position:0%
changes that we can go over when we
 
00:53:28.870 --> 00:53:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:31.109 --> 00:53:31.119 align:start position:0%
long-term supports and services this
 
00:53:34.670 --> 00:53:34.680 align:start position:0%
includes U developmental disabilities as
 
00:53:37.309 --> 00:53:37.319 align:start position:0%
well as uh long-term
 
00:53:40.829 --> 00:53:40.839 align:start position:0%
care and um the changes here were
 
00:53:42.789 --> 00:53:42.799 align:start position:0%
primarily to the developmental
 
00:53:46.349 --> 00:53:46.359 align:start position:0%
disabilities budget and uh the director
 
00:53:51.710 --> 00:53:51.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:55.349 --> 00:53:55.359 align:start position:0%
well this is the division uh of Medicaid
 
00:53:55.359 --> 00:53:56.990 align:start position:0%
well this is the division uh of Medicaid
services

00:53:56.990 --> 00:53:57.000 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:54:00.030 --> 00:54:00.040 align:start position:0%
uh this is of course our largest
 
00:54:02.309 --> 00:54:02.319 align:start position:0%
budget I would mention that this does
 
00:54:04.630 --> 00:54:04.640 align:start position:0%
not include Medicaid expansion this is
 
00:54:06.750 --> 00:54:06.760 align:start position:0%
only standard Medicaid as well as
 
00:54:09.150 --> 00:54:09.160 align:start position:0%
several other accounting units related
 
00:54:11.950 --> 00:54:11.960 align:start position:0%
to Medicaid uh as I mentioned one of the
 
00:54:14.589 --> 00:54:14.599 align:start position:0%
largest increases was just moving those
 
00:54:17.270 --> 00:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
dcyf expenditures from the dcyf budget
 
00:54:20.270 --> 00:54:20.280 align:start position:0%
into the Medicaid budget um there were
 
00:54:24.030 --> 00:54:24.040 align:start position:0%
also um expected changes in enrollment
 
00:54:27.510 --> 00:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
um what I would mention there are two
 
00:54:30.990 --> 00:54:31.000 align:start position:0%
uh anomalies if you will for fiscal year
 
00:54:35.549 --> 00:54:35.559 align:start position:0%
22 in this budget we have been told to
 
00:54:38.150 --> 00:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
expect the enhanced fmap to continue
 
00:54:42.670 --> 00:54:42.680 align:start position:0%
through December of 21 so we have um
 
00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
adjusted the federal General funds to
 
00:54:50.750 --> 00:54:50.760 align:start position:0%
um to budget for what we expect will
 
00:54:52.390 --> 00:54:52.400 align:start position:0%
happen there with receiving that
 
00:54:55.230 --> 00:54:55.240 align:start position:0%
enhanced fmap for those two quarters of
 
00:55:00.069 --> 00:55:00.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:03.069 --> 00:55:03.079 align:start position:0%
um that also means that the case loads
 
00:55:05.589 --> 00:55:05.599 align:start position:0%
will continue to stay high through those
 
00:55:07.950 --> 00:55:07.960 align:start position:0%
first two quarters of fiscal year
 
00:55:11.670 --> 00:55:11.680 align:start position:0%
22 otherwise this is budgeted as though
 
00:55:15.470 --> 00:55:15.480 align:start position:0%
the case LS go back to a preco level as
 
00:55:18.750 --> 00:55:18.760 align:start position:0%
of January 1 of
 
00:55:22.309 --> 00:55:22.319 align:start position:0%
22 but again the Medicaid budget will go
 
00:55:25.150 --> 00:55:25.160 align:start position:0%
into that in a lot more
 
00:55:28.630 --> 00:55:28.640 align:start position:0%
depth um the division for Public Health
 
00:55:32.349 --> 00:55:32.359 align:start position:0%
Services one of the the main changes
 
00:55:35.150 --> 00:55:35.160 align:start position:0%
here from the agency phase in oop sorry
 
00:55:36.990 --> 00:55:37.000 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards did I see your
 
00:55:41.670 --> 00:55:41.680 align:start position:0%
hand no okay sorry um division of Public
 
00:55:44.630 --> 00:55:44.640 align:start position:0%
Health Services one of the changes here
 
00:55:46.510 --> 00:55:46.520 align:start position:0%
uh from the agency phase to the
 
00:55:50.710 --> 00:55:50.720 align:start position:0%
governor's phase was in the um Family
 
00:55:53.750 --> 00:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
Planning space there is an anticipated
 
00:55:56.870 --> 00:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
rule change at the federal level where
 
00:56:00.470 --> 00:56:00.480 align:start position:0%
previously um there were some Family
 
00:56:02.109 --> 00:56:02.119 align:start position:0%
Planning facilities in the state that
 
00:56:04.029 --> 00:56:04.039 align:start position:0%
could no longer receive federal funds
 
00:56:05.990 --> 00:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
directly from the federal government and
 
00:56:09.789 --> 00:56:09.799 align:start position:0%
last bym had been provided General funds
 
00:56:12.789 --> 00:56:12.799 align:start position:0%
uh to make up for that it is anticipated
 
00:56:15.670 --> 00:56:15.680 align:start position:0%
that the rules will change um and they
 
00:56:17.430 --> 00:56:17.440 align:start position:0%
will receive those federal funds from
 
00:56:19.270 --> 00:56:19.280 align:start position:0%
the federal government again so that was
 
00:56:21.510 --> 00:56:21.520 align:start position:0%
a change made in the agency
 
00:56:24.990 --> 00:56:25.000 align:start position:0%
budget during the governor's
 
00:56:29.870 --> 00:56:29.880 align:start position:0%
phase Glen Cliff um continues to remain
 
00:56:32.029 --> 00:56:32.039 align:start position:0%
steady in budgeting and there's really
 
00:56:34.710 --> 00:56:34.720 align:start position:0%
no substantial changes in their
 
00:56:37.109 --> 00:56:37.119 align:start position:0%
budget New Hampshire
 
00:56:39.309 --> 00:56:39.319 align:start position:0%
hospital as I mentioned earlier the
 
00:56:42.470 --> 00:56:42.480 align:start position:0%
largest increase there is the additional
 
00:56:46.430 --> 00:56:46.440 align:start position:0%
positions to fully staff the uh Hospital
 
00:56:49.069 --> 00:56:49.079 align:start position:0%
Wing that has been converted or will be
 
00:56:51.190 --> 00:56:51.200 align:start position:0%
converted in process of being converted
 
00:56:53.870 --> 00:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
from a children's Wing to an adult Wing
 
00:56:57.190 --> 00:56:57.200 align:start position:0%
uh additionally the increase here is
 
00:56:59.910 --> 00:56:59.920 align:start position:0%
also related to the path program which
 
00:57:02.029 --> 00:57:02.039 align:start position:0%
is the transitional housing program that
 
00:57:06.710 --> 00:57:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:10.390 --> 00:57:10.400 align:start position:0%
building and the last two of course are
 
00:57:12.510 --> 00:57:12.520 align:start position:0%
Office of the commissioner the first one
 
00:57:14.670 --> 00:57:14.680 align:start position:0%
being operations and the second one
 
00:57:17.309 --> 00:57:17.319 align:start position:0%
being Bureau of Information Services
 
00:57:23.630 --> 00:57:23.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:26.430 --> 00:57:26.440 align:start position:0%
today so again that's just a high
 
00:57:28.270 --> 00:57:28.280 align:start position:0%
overview and I would expect that you
 
00:57:30.069 --> 00:57:30.079 align:start position:0%
will get a lot more details as we go
 
00:57:32.470 --> 00:57:32.480 align:start position:0%
through each division it looks like you
 
00:57:35.230 --> 00:57:35.240 align:start position:0%
got one more slide I
 
00:57:38.430 --> 00:57:38.440 align:start position:0%
do okay um so just to mention a few of
 
00:57:40.069 --> 00:57:40.079 align:start position:0%
the prioritized needs the governor's
 
00:57:42.670 --> 00:57:42.680 align:start position:0%
budget uh was not able to include any of
 
00:57:44.870 --> 00:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
the prioritized needs that we had and I
 
00:57:46.309 --> 00:57:46.319 align:start position:0%
just wanted to mention there were some
 
00:57:48.750 --> 00:57:48.760 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs for shelter funds and
 
00:57:50.870 --> 00:57:50.880 align:start position:0%
homeless and housing uh tobacco
 
00:57:53.990 --> 00:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
prevention program as well as many
 
00:57:56.309 --> 00:57:56.319 align:start position:0%
deferred maintenance items to building
 
00:58:00.349 --> 00:58:00.359 align:start position:0%
that DHHS um owns and maintains uh we
 
00:58:02.990 --> 00:58:03.000 align:start position:0%
have all of our facilities like New
 
00:58:06.430 --> 00:58:06.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital and Glen Cliff syc
 
00:58:09.270 --> 00:58:09.280 align:start position:0%
which is sununu Youth Services Center
 
00:58:11.710 --> 00:58:11.720 align:start position:0%
they all are owned and managed by the
 
00:58:13.589 --> 00:58:13.599 align:start position:0%
department so there are deferred
 
00:58:16.549 --> 00:58:16.559 align:start position:0%
maintenance items related to those um as
 
00:58:18.710 --> 00:58:18.720 align:start position:0%
well as some operating costs for it
 
00:58:21.150 --> 00:58:21.160 align:start position:0%
items which Dave weers can cover later
 
00:58:25.109 --> 00:58:25.119 align:start position:0%
today um and Lori Weber will talk about
 
00:58:27.430 --> 00:58:27.440 align:start position:0%
the Deferred maintenance
 
00:58:29.029 --> 00:58:29.039 align:start position:0%
I just want to make sure I understand
 
00:58:30.589 --> 00:58:30.599 align:start position:0%
what you just said this is these are
 
00:58:35.029 --> 00:58:35.039 align:start position:0%
things that DHHS says are important but
 
00:58:37.549 --> 00:58:37.559 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget did not fund
 
00:58:40.670 --> 00:58:40.680 align:start position:0%
correct that's okay what how much money
 
00:58:42.670 --> 00:58:42.680 align:start position:0%
does that represent and it is it all
 
00:58:44.910 --> 00:58:44.920 align:start position:0%
operational money or is some of that
 
00:58:48.470 --> 00:58:48.480 align:start position:0%
Capital NOP these are all operational um
 
00:58:50.109 --> 00:58:50.119 align:start position:0%
and I don't remember the numbers off the
 
00:58:51.990 --> 00:58:52.000 align:start position:0%
top of my head what I will make sure to
 
00:58:56.910 --> 00:58:56.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:59.950 --> 00:58:59.960 align:start position:0%
are there questions from the
 
00:59:02.230 --> 00:59:02.240 align:start position:0%
committee representative Bean were you
 
00:59:04.270 --> 00:59:04.280 align:start position:0%
just stretching your hand
 
00:59:08.549 --> 00:59:08.559 align:start position:0%
there I'm good okay all
 
00:59:13.870 --> 00:59:13.880 align:start position:0%
right okay uh very good what's your plan
 
00:59:16.589 --> 00:59:16.599 align:start position:0%
now Mr Ripple go ahead if I may if there
 
00:59:18.109 --> 00:59:18.119 align:start position:0%
are any other questions for the
 
00:59:19.789 --> 00:59:19.799 align:start position:0%
commissioner I would just like to give
 
00:59:22.109 --> 00:59:22.119 align:start position:0%
you all the opportunity to ask her those
 
00:59:26.109 --> 00:59:26.119 align:start position:0%
now uh related to the department um as
 
00:59:28.789 --> 00:59:28.799 align:start position:0%
she will probably jump off after this
 
00:59:32.430 --> 00:59:32.440 align:start position:0%
and um Lori Weaver and I will be picking
 
00:59:35.670 --> 00:59:35.680 align:start position:0%
up she's busy I I understand her need to
 
00:59:38.630 --> 00:59:38.640 align:start position:0%
go and um I if we need to get hold of
 
00:59:40.829 --> 00:59:40.839 align:start position:0%
her later I imagine she'll take a phone
 
00:59:43.549 --> 00:59:43.559 align:start position:0%
call or an email
 
00:59:47.029 --> 00:59:47.039 align:start position:0%
so yes email is is probably best way to
 
00:59:50.230 --> 00:59:50.240 align:start position:0%
reach me as uh I'm not picking up my
 
00:59:53.789 --> 00:59:53.799 align:start position:0%
voicemails as often as uh I I can
 
00:59:55.710 --> 00:59:55.720 align:start position:0%

commissioner all right I don't see
 
01:00:15.589 --> 01:00:15.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:18.270 --> 01:00:18.280 align:start position:0%
much so Mr
 
01:00:21.670 --> 01:00:21.680 align:start position:0%
Ripple help me here um is this where
 
01:00:23.670 --> 01:00:23.680 align:start position:0%
we're supposed to go through actual
 
01:00:26.109 --> 01:00:26.119 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets and budget line items or
 
01:00:27.750 --> 01:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
are we supposed to go to the next
 
01:00:29.870 --> 01:00:29.880 align:start position:0%
speaker well I think at the moment
 
01:00:31.349 --> 01:00:31.359 align:start position:0%
you'll go to the next speaker and
 
01:00:33.270 --> 01:00:33.280 align:start position:0%
there's a division presentation that
 
01:00:34.870 --> 01:00:34.880 align:start position:0%
Karen and a few other people will go
 
01:00:36.630 --> 01:00:36.640 align:start position:0%
through and after that you'll start
 
01:00:45.750 --> 01:00:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:48.230 --> 01:00:48.240 align:start position:0%
division so do I need to bring over a
 
01:00:50.670 --> 01:00:50.680 align:start position:0%
few more people for this Karen yes I
 
01:00:52.870 --> 01:00:52.880 align:start position:0%
believe if you could bring over Beth
 
01:00:54.710 --> 01:00:54.720 align:start position:0%
Kelly and
 
01:00:56.670 --> 01:00:56.680 align:start position:0%
Landry okay
 
01:01:00.390 --> 01:01:00.400 align:start position:0%
um those would be the two for now okay
 
01:01:02.829 --> 01:01:02.839 align:start position:0%
so we we've been going for an hour if
 
01:01:05.150 --> 01:01:05.160 align:start position:0%
anyone needs to take a quick bio break
 
01:01:07.870 --> 01:01:07.880 align:start position:0%
there's a transition here otherwise
 
01:01:16.470 --> 01:01:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:21.549 --> 01:01:21.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:23.630 --> 01:01:23.640 align:start position:0%
right all right I'm going to go ahead
 
01:01:26.390 --> 01:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
and um turn things over to Lori just let
 
01:01:29.630 --> 01:01:29.640 align:start position:0%

01:01:54.470 --> 01:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
61 if you oh I'm sorry I'm I'm not on
 
01:01:57.430 --> 01:01:57.440 align:start position:0%
mute I just looked at the 61 slides and
 
01:01:59.829 --> 01:01:59.839 align:start position:0%
reacted sorry that's okay I said the
 
01:02:02.349 --> 01:02:02.359 align:start position:0%
same thing when I finished the deck I
 
01:02:05.630 --> 01:02:05.640 align:start position:0%
I'm sure every slide is exciting yes
 
01:02:08.470 --> 01:02:08.480 align:start position:0%
well uh I'm gonna get rid of another
 
01:02:10.269 --> 01:02:10.279 align:start position:0%
slide for you Karen if you can go to the
 
01:02:12.990 --> 01:02:13.000 align:start position:0%
next slide um I think it would be more
 
01:02:17.349 --> 01:02:17.359 align:start position:0%
specific so the way the prior deck that
 
01:02:19.510 --> 01:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
um the commissioner just went over there
 
01:02:22.190 --> 01:02:22.200 align:start position:0%
was a slide that's had colors on it and
 
01:02:23.789 --> 01:02:23.799 align:start position:0%
it had the different chunks of the
 
01:02:26.510 --> 01:02:26.520 align:start position:0%
department and primarily
 
01:02:28.990 --> 01:02:29.000 align:start position:0%
we look at that not as an or chart but
 
01:02:31.269 --> 01:02:31.279 align:start position:0%
of all the programs and services that
 
01:02:34.069 --> 01:02:34.079 align:start position:0%
the department offers so that if anyone
 
01:02:36.109 --> 01:02:36.119 align:start position:0%
from the outside uh not in the
 
01:02:37.870 --> 01:02:37.880 align:start position:0%
department wants to say hey where can I
 
01:02:40.109 --> 01:02:40.119 align:start position:0%
find Medicaid where can I find food
 
01:02:43.029 --> 01:02:43.039 align:start position:0%
stamps um they would be able to look at
 
01:02:44.789 --> 01:02:44.799 align:start position:0%
that so it's a way that we sort of
 
01:02:47.190 --> 01:02:47.200 align:start position:0%
organize ourselves to make sense to the
 
01:02:49.390 --> 01:02:49.400 align:start position:0%
general public because it's a large
 
01:02:51.470 --> 01:02:51.480 align:start position:0%
department and it's complex with all of
 
01:02:54.390 --> 01:02:54.400 align:start position:0%
the various components so you will be
 
01:02:56.150 --> 01:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
hearing over the next couple couple of
 
01:02:58.549 --> 01:02:58.559 align:start position:0%
week from divisions as Karen mentioned
 
01:03:00.510 --> 01:03:00.520 align:start position:0%
we have economic and Housing Services
 
01:03:01.950 --> 01:03:01.960 align:start position:0%
you have the division of children youth
 
01:03:04.910 --> 01:03:04.920 align:start position:0%
and families and so on we also have our
 
01:03:06.910 --> 01:03:06.920 align:start position:0%
administrative operations sort of get
 
01:03:09.470 --> 01:03:09.480 align:start position:0%
lumped into what we call the office of
 
01:03:12.630 --> 01:03:12.640 align:start position:0%
the commissioner or oom as it's uh
 
01:03:15.349 --> 01:03:15.359 align:start position:0%
commonly referenced in the acronym world
 
01:03:19.029 --> 01:03:19.039 align:start position:0%
uh but oom consists of the pieces that
 
01:03:21.230 --> 01:03:21.240 align:start position:0%
you have here in this deck which we're
 
01:03:23.630 --> 01:03:23.640 align:start position:0%
about to go over which is finan and our
 
01:03:26.309 --> 01:03:26.319 align:start position:0%
contracts unit our human resource our
 
01:03:28.829 --> 01:03:28.839 align:start position:0%
employee assistance program our
 
01:03:30.870 --> 01:03:30.880 align:start position:0%
facilities and maintenance talks a
 
01:03:33.190 --> 01:03:33.200 align:start position:0%
little bit about our district offices in
 
01:03:35.549 --> 01:03:35.559 align:start position:0%
terms of how those uh services are laid
 
01:03:38.230 --> 01:03:38.240 align:start position:0%
out our office of Health Equity and then
 
01:03:39.750 --> 01:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
in addition you have your Bureau of
 
01:03:41.829 --> 01:03:41.839 align:start position:0%
Information Services with Dave weeders
 
01:03:44.269 --> 01:03:44.279 align:start position:0%
and you have um Meredith Telly loops
 
01:03:47.990 --> 01:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
with a program quality and integrity as
 
01:03:49.950 --> 01:03:49.960 align:start position:0%
well as legal services so that's sort of
 
01:03:52.430 --> 01:03:52.440 align:start position:0%
the high level of the oom and how we
 
01:03:54.910 --> 01:03:54.920 align:start position:0%
Clump together the the ones that I'm
 
01:03:56.950 --> 01:03:56.960 align:start position:0%
about to speak to in this deck and
 
01:03:58.430 --> 01:03:58.440 align:start position:0%
Karen's going to start our off with
 
01:04:00.309 --> 01:04:00.319 align:start position:0%
finance and contracts are a little bit
 
01:04:03.910 --> 01:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
smaller than um the the larger division
 
01:04:05.710 --> 01:04:05.720 align:start position:0%
so we thought it would be easier more
 
01:04:08.470 --> 01:04:08.480 align:start position:0%
palatable to be able to present it to
 
01:04:11.150 --> 01:04:11.160 align:start position:0%
you in one deck um so even though
 
01:04:13.430 --> 01:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
there's 61 slides representative Edwards
 
01:04:16.069 --> 01:04:16.079 align:start position:0%
there are a couple of blank slides uh
 
01:04:19.510 --> 01:04:19.520 align:start position:0%
which sort of separate out sections so
 
01:04:21.349 --> 01:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
um the first section that we have is is
 
01:04:23.109 --> 01:04:23.119 align:start position:0%
a high level overview of the finance and
 
01:04:24.710 --> 01:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
contracts unit I'll turn it back over to
 
01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:30.150 align:start position:0%
contracts unit I'll turn it back over to
Karen

01:04:30.150 --> 01:04:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:32.230 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:04:32.230 --> 01:04:32.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:04:35.430 --> 01:04:35.440 align:start position:0%
um what I wanted to mention and
 
01:04:37.510 --> 01:04:37.520 align:start position:0%
represent chair you mentioned this
 
01:04:39.789 --> 01:04:39.799 align:start position:0%
earlier that you had sent over a list of
 
01:04:41.190 --> 01:04:41.200 align:start position:0%
questions that you wanted to make sure
 
01:04:44.589 --> 01:04:44.599 align:start position:0%
that we answered um and we made sure to
 
01:04:47.789 --> 01:04:47.799 align:start position:0%
incorporate those in our slides with um
 
01:04:49.710 --> 01:04:49.720 align:start position:0%
a few exceptions and I wanted to walk
 
01:04:50.829 --> 01:04:50.839 align:start position:0%
you through what some of those
 
01:04:53.710 --> 01:04:53.720 align:start position:0%
exceptions are uh first of all
 
01:04:55.990 --> 01:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
seccession planning Lori Weaver is going
 
01:04:57.950 --> 01:04:57.960 align:start position:0%
to talk about secession planning at a
 
01:05:00.190 --> 01:05:00.200 align:start position:0%
department level um a little bit later
 
01:05:03.190 --> 01:05:03.200 align:start position:0%
in the slides um so we won't be covering
 
01:05:06.990 --> 01:05:07.000 align:start position:0%
that in each of the um in each of the
 
01:05:09.630 --> 01:05:09.640 align:start position:0%
presentations uh litigation will be
 
01:05:12.029 --> 01:05:12.039 align:start position:0%
covered by Melissa St sier who is our
 
01:05:14.029 --> 01:05:14.039 align:start position:0%
chief legal officer she will cover
 
01:05:16.230 --> 01:05:16.240 align:start position:0%
litigation for the whole department so
 
01:05:17.910 --> 01:05:17.920 align:start position:0%
again litigation will not be in each of
 
01:05:20.390 --> 01:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
the presentations and then audits of the
 
01:05:23.630 --> 01:05:23.640 align:start position:0%
department will be covered by U Meredith
 
01:05:27.109 --> 01:05:27.119 align:start position:0%
too um and a little little bit by myself
 
01:05:30.109 --> 01:05:30.119 align:start position:0%
uh later again when she presents um and
 
01:05:32.190 --> 01:05:32.200 align:start position:0%
she will cover that for the whole
 
01:05:34.390 --> 01:05:34.400 align:start position:0%
department Additionally you may see
 
01:05:37.309 --> 01:05:37.319 align:start position:0%
slight variations in slides as some
 
01:05:39.589 --> 01:05:39.599 align:start position:0%
things were more applicable than others
 
01:05:42.390 --> 01:05:42.400 align:start position:0%
for example here um as I go through my
 
01:05:44.710 --> 01:05:44.720 align:start position:0%
slides I'm talking about one accounting
 
01:05:49.269 --> 01:05:49.279 align:start position:0%
unit that um has all of the account uh
 
01:05:53.069 --> 01:05:53.079 align:start position:0%
accounting finance and uh procurement
 
01:05:56.150 --> 01:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
contract staff in it um so it's a much
 
01:05:58.710 --> 01:05:58.720 align:start position:0%
smaller accounting unit um and of course
 
01:06:03.670 --> 01:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
our mission is fairly clear so from a um
 
01:06:07.950 --> 01:06:07.960 align:start position:0%
introductory perspective there are
 
01:06:11.230 --> 01:06:11.240 align:start position:0%
um there are two people who are key
 
01:06:14.710 --> 01:06:14.720 align:start position:0%
people for me in finance and contracts
 
01:06:16.789 --> 01:06:16.799 align:start position:0%
and then there are several people who
 
01:06:20.750 --> 01:06:20.760 align:start position:0%
are um who are secondary key if you will
 
01:06:22.750 --> 01:06:22.760 align:start position:0%
who will you will meet over the next
 
01:06:25.190 --> 01:06:25.200 align:start position:0%
several weeks uh which reminds me Kevin
 
01:06:26.069 --> 01:06:26.079 align:start position:0%
if you
 
01:06:28.309 --> 01:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
bring Mary Kalise over as well because
 
01:06:30.589 --> 01:06:30.599 align:start position:0%
there may be times that I need her and I
 
01:06:32.309 --> 01:06:32.319 align:start position:0%
apologize veryy for not mentioning you
 
01:06:34.990 --> 01:06:35.000 align:start position:0%
from the beginning so as I mentioned
 
01:06:38.390 --> 01:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
earlier I have been CFO of DHHS for
 
01:06:40.470 --> 01:06:40.480 align:start position:0%
about three years and I previously
 
01:06:41.990 --> 01:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
worked for the Department of Revenue
 
01:06:44.510 --> 01:06:44.520 align:start position:0%
Administration for about 10 years so you
 
01:06:46.670 --> 01:06:46.680 align:start position:0%
will see that I often still have a keen
 
01:06:50.109 --> 01:06:50.119 align:start position:0%
interest in revenues for the state Mary
 
01:06:53.470 --> 01:06:53.480 align:start position:0%
Kalise is my Deputy CFO I do not operate
 
01:06:56.109 --> 01:06:56.119 align:start position:0%
without this person she is a amazing she
 
01:06:57.789 --> 01:06:57.799 align:start position:0%
has been with the department for 25
 
01:06:59.510 --> 01:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
years there is not much about the
 
01:07:01.910 --> 01:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
department that Mary does not know her
 
01:07:05.349 --> 01:07:05.359 align:start position:0%
historical knowledge is critical for us
 
01:07:07.430 --> 01:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
uh Nathan white is our director of
 
01:07:09.670 --> 01:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
contracts he's been with the HHS for
 
01:07:11.750 --> 01:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
about three years previously he worked
 
01:07:14.309 --> 01:07:14.319 align:start position:0%
for the LBA and you will see later that
 
01:07:16.950 --> 01:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
there are many accomplishments um that
 
01:07:21.670 --> 01:07:21.680 align:start position:0%
he has since he has been working for the
 
01:07:26.190 --> 01:07:26.200 align:start position:0%
Department I look at um our division of
 
01:07:29.069 --> 01:07:29.079 align:start position:0%
finance broken into three groups but
 
01:07:31.230 --> 01:07:31.240 align:start position:0%
technically we are two um there is
 
01:07:33.150 --> 01:07:33.160 align:start position:0%
finance and there is contracts but
 
01:07:37.390 --> 01:07:37.400 align:start position:0%
within our finance team there are two um
 
01:07:39.950 --> 01:07:39.960 align:start position:0%
types of groups if you will there's what
 
01:07:42.230 --> 01:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
I would call the expenditure group so
 
01:07:44.269 --> 01:07:44.279 align:start position:0%
each division including office of
 
01:07:47.190 --> 01:07:47.200 align:start position:0%
commissioner has a finance director or
 
01:07:48.950 --> 01:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
what we sometimes refer to as a budget
 
01:07:51.390 --> 01:07:51.400 align:start position:0%
team member in this case for office of
 
01:07:53.230 --> 01:07:53.240 align:start position:0%
the commissioner that's Beth Kelly that
 
01:07:54.990 --> 01:07:55.000 align:start position:0%
was the other person that I asked to be
 
01:07:56.069 --> 01:07:56.079 align:start position:0%
brought over
 
01:07:58.589 --> 01:07:58.599 align:start position:0%
so she manages the day-to-day finances
 
01:08:00.870 --> 01:08:00.880 align:start position:0%
for the office of the
 
01:08:03.549 --> 01:08:03.559 align:start position:0%
commissioner um the largest budget of
 
01:08:05.510 --> 01:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
course is Medicaid but the largest
 
01:08:07.150 --> 01:08:07.160 align:start position:0%
number of accounting units is public
 
01:08:09.549 --> 01:08:09.559 align:start position:0%
health so we're very variable in what
 
01:08:14.510 --> 01:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
our uh finances look like um and that
 
01:08:16.789 --> 01:08:16.799 align:start position:0%
last box I should have deleted I
 
01:08:19.510 --> 01:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
apologize that came from a template and
 
01:08:21.590 --> 01:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
is not related to the division of
 
01:08:24.950 --> 01:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
finance um the revenue reporting and
 
01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:26.349 align:start position:0%
finance um the revenue reporting and
grants

01:08:26.349 --> 01:08:26.359 align:start position:0%
grants
 
01:08:28.990 --> 01:08:29.000 align:start position:0%
management so a couple of years ago we
 
01:08:31.590 --> 01:08:31.600 align:start position:0%
established a position to oversee all of
 
01:08:33.950 --> 01:08:33.960 align:start position:0%
the revenue after an audit finding in
 
01:08:38.510 --> 01:08:38.520 align:start position:0%
2019 that recommended that um
 
01:08:41.269 --> 01:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
we've um we've not been able to
 
01:08:43.390 --> 01:08:43.400 align:start position:0%
implement all of our plans around that
 
01:08:46.430 --> 01:08:46.440 align:start position:0%
position uh due to covid and the hiring
 
01:08:49.990 --> 01:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
freeze however we have budg a changed
 
01:08:52.709 --> 01:08:52.719 align:start position:0%
how we have budgeted over the past two
 
01:08:55.430 --> 01:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
years and the finance committee last
 
01:08:57.870 --> 01:08:57.880 align:start position:0%
fanium heard a lot about this we now
 
01:09:00.709 --> 01:09:00.719 align:start position:0%
budget by Revenue sources so there was a
 
01:09:04.550 --> 01:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
time um back uh that Kevin will remember
 
01:09:06.550 --> 01:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
very well when somebody would say could
 
01:09:09.070 --> 01:09:09.080 align:start position:0%
you tell us where every tan of dollar is
 
01:09:13.789 --> 01:09:13.799 align:start position:0%
budgeted and we would say no we can't um
 
01:09:17.749 --> 01:09:17.759 align:start position:0%
which was not great and last bium was
 
01:09:20.669 --> 01:09:20.679 align:start position:0%
the first time um that we were able to
 
01:09:22.950 --> 01:09:22.960 align:start position:0%
provide that and Mary and I were both a
 
01:09:24.749 --> 01:09:24.759 align:start position:0%
little bit sad that Neil Kirk was not
 
01:09:27.550 --> 01:09:27.560 align:start position:0%
around for to present him that because
 
01:09:30.349 --> 01:09:30.359 align:start position:0%
he had been asking for many many mums to
 
01:09:32.950 --> 01:09:32.960 align:start position:0%
see exactly that and I do believe that I
 
01:09:34.749 --> 01:09:34.759 align:start position:0%
asked representative Earth to tell him
 
01:09:37.590 --> 01:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
about it um so that is was an exciting
 
01:09:40.189 --> 01:09:40.199 align:start position:0%
change for us it has been a change in
 
01:09:42.390 --> 01:09:42.400 align:start position:0%
how we do our work but it is going well
 
01:09:45.229 --> 01:09:45.239 align:start position:0%
and we're going to continue to move um
 
01:09:46.309 --> 01:09:46.319 align:start position:0%
to do
 
01:09:48.910 --> 01:09:48.920 align:start position:0%
that this group is responsible for
 
01:09:51.870 --> 01:09:51.880 align:start position:0%
filing more than 200 expenditure reports
 
01:09:54.750 --> 01:09:54.760 align:start position:0%
every year with our federal partners and
 
01:09:56.070 --> 01:09:56.080 align:start position:0%
they're also
 
01:09:58.070 --> 01:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
um responsible for maintaining our
 
01:10:00.390 --> 01:10:00.400 align:start position:0%
federally required Public Assistance
 
01:10:03.390 --> 01:10:03.400 align:start position:0%
cost allocation plan which I mentioned
 
01:10:06.350 --> 01:10:06.360 align:start position:0%
earlier a newer part of this team which
 
01:10:09.189 --> 01:10:09.199 align:start position:0%
is also um really with the contracts
 
01:10:11.430 --> 01:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
team but works very closely with our
 
01:10:15.550 --> 01:10:15.560 align:start position:0%
Revenue team is Grants management um
 
01:10:18.030 --> 01:10:18.040 align:start position:0%
they are working to establish policy and
 
01:10:22.470 --> 01:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
procedure for Grants um all across DHHS
 
01:10:24.430 --> 01:10:24.440 align:start position:0%
and this is actually an area that we
 
01:10:27.310 --> 01:10:27.320 align:start position:0%
work very close mostly with merid of tan
 
01:10:28.630 --> 01:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
and when you hear more about her
 
01:10:30.790 --> 01:10:30.800 align:start position:0%
division you will understand why there
 
01:10:32.709 --> 01:10:32.719 align:start position:0%
is so much relationship between grants
 
01:10:34.430 --> 01:10:34.440 align:start position:0%
management and contracts and the work
 
01:10:35.750 --> 01:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
that she
 
01:10:39.390 --> 01:10:39.400 align:start position:0%
does our contracts division of course is
 
01:10:41.990 --> 01:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
in charge of facilitating all of our uh
 
01:10:44.910 --> 01:10:44.920 align:start position:0%
Contracting Services of which we have
 
01:10:48.390 --> 01:10:48.400 align:start position:0%
many we typically have anywhere between
 
01:10:51.070 --> 01:10:51.080 align:start position:0%
800 and 1,000 active contracts at any
 
01:10:54.870 --> 01:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
given time during covid that uh almost
 
01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:56.070 align:start position:0%
given time during covid that uh almost
double

01:10:56.070 --> 01:10:56.080 align:start position:0%
double
 
01:10:59.070 --> 01:10:59.080 align:start position:0%
um so the Contracting work over the past
 
01:11:04.229 --> 01:11:04.239 align:start position:0%
year um has been uh quite High I believe
 
01:11:06.229 --> 01:11:06.239 align:start position:0%
Nathan testified yesterday to a senate
 
01:11:09.590 --> 01:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
committee that um virtually all of his
 
01:11:12.110 --> 01:11:12.120 align:start position:0%
staff have been working full-time
 
01:11:14.590 --> 01:11:14.600 align:start position:0%
overtime for over a year with very
 
01:11:17.630 --> 01:11:17.640 align:start position:0%
little vacation time um so it has been a
 
01:11:20.390 --> 01:11:20.400 align:start position:0%
strain on that team they are also
 
01:11:22.390 --> 01:11:22.400 align:start position:0%
organized in teams that are assigned to
 
01:11:23.390 --> 01:11:23.400 align:start position:0%
each of the
 
01:11:25.669 --> 01:11:25.679 align:start position:0%
divisions and as I just mention men the
 
01:11:29.030 --> 01:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
volume has increased 113% since
 
01:11:32.030 --> 01:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
2017 the largest increase due to co over
 
01:11:35.750 --> 01:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
400 contracts um have been related to
 
01:11:38.149 --> 01:11:38.159 align:start position:0%
co I have a question for you on that
 
01:11:41.750 --> 01:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
slide yes um okay I I just want to make
 
01:11:45.110 --> 01:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
sure I understand if you have uh I
 
01:11:47.350 --> 01:11:47.360 align:start position:0%
assume you have lawyers in that group
 
01:11:50.430 --> 01:11:50.440 align:start position:0%
and that uh when you guys do a contract
 
01:11:52.910 --> 01:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
you are the Contracting Office that you
 
01:11:55.310 --> 01:11:55.320 align:start position:0%
are the ones that obligate the state
 
01:11:57.550 --> 01:11:57.560 align:start position:0%
legally to the contract that there isn't
 
01:12:00.350 --> 01:12:00.360 align:start position:0%
some Contracting Office somewhere else
 
01:12:02.390 --> 01:12:02.400 align:start position:0%
in the state you guys are you guys are
 
01:12:03.990 --> 01:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
writing your
 
01:12:07.270 --> 01:12:07.280 align:start position:0%
contract yes so there is um an attorney
 
01:12:09.910 --> 01:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
that works within the contracts division
 
01:12:12.070 --> 01:12:12.080 align:start position:0%
um that assists with anything that's
 
01:12:14.189 --> 01:12:14.199 align:start position:0%
related to Legal work in addition uh
 
01:12:15.990 --> 01:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
that team does also work closely with
 
01:12:18.470 --> 01:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
Melissa St sier especially as it's been
 
01:12:20.990 --> 01:12:21.000 align:start position:0%
relating to covid they also work with
 
01:12:22.390 --> 01:12:22.400 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office the
 
01:12:24.750 --> 01:12:24.760 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office reviews um
 
01:12:28.110 --> 01:12:28.120 align:start position:0%
many if not all of our contracts uh and
 
01:12:29.669 --> 01:12:29.679 align:start position:0%
our larger
 
01:12:32.790 --> 01:12:32.800 align:start position:0%
rfps um as far as who signs the contract
 
01:12:34.790 --> 01:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
that's typically whoever the
 
01:12:36.750 --> 01:12:36.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner uh designates to be
 
01:12:38.790 --> 01:12:38.800 align:start position:0%
authorized to sign the contract which is
 
01:12:41.310 --> 01:12:41.320 align:start position:0%
typically only division directors so the
 
01:12:43.669 --> 01:12:43.679 align:start position:0%
contracts unit staff themselves do not
 
01:12:46.669 --> 01:12:46.679 align:start position:0%
become the signatory on the contract um
 
01:12:48.149 --> 01:12:48.159 align:start position:0%
it's typically the division director
 
01:12:49.070 --> 01:12:49.080 align:start position:0%
that's the
 
01:12:51.830 --> 01:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
signatory so if I ever got curious about
 
01:12:54.709 --> 01:12:54.719 align:start position:0%
an RFP we've released or a contract
 
01:12:57.510 --> 01:12:57.520 align:start position:0%
we've signed mind I I would contact Miss
 
01:13:01.430 --> 01:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
Weaver I I would contact uh Mr Ripple
 
01:13:03.390 --> 01:13:03.400 align:start position:0%
who would get to you how how how would
 
01:13:06.430 --> 01:13:06.440 align:start position:0%
we do that so probably the best way is
 
01:13:08.750 --> 01:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
to is to work through Kevin uh through
 
01:13:11.790 --> 01:13:11.800 align:start position:0%
Mr Ripple um he would reach out to me
 
01:13:13.870 --> 01:13:13.880 align:start position:0%
and I would work with Nathan white who's
 
01:13:15.629 --> 01:13:15.639 align:start position:0%
the director of the contracts Division
 
01:13:18.390 --> 01:13:18.400 align:start position:0%
and the division director who um who
 
01:13:21.270 --> 01:13:21.280 align:start position:0%
manages that contract so it would it
 
01:13:22.910 --> 01:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
would probably be more than one person
 
01:13:27.030 --> 01:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:28.629 --> 01:13:28.639 align:start position:0%
so the easiest way to save you from
 
01:13:30.350 --> 01:13:30.360 align:start position:0%
having to reach out to three or four
 
01:13:41.990 --> 01:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:47.070 --> 01:13:47.080 align:start position:0%
Kevin some of our accomplishments
 
01:13:49.350 --> 01:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
um the
 
01:13:52.310 --> 01:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
um the contracts division uh under
 
01:13:54.510 --> 01:13:54.520 align:start position:0%
Nathan's Direction has improved their
 
01:13:58.790 --> 01:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
process greatly they Institute a for
 
01:14:02.189 --> 01:14:02.199 align:start position:0%
inter instituted a forecasting system
 
01:14:06.430 --> 01:14:06.440 align:start position:0%
and fiscal year 21 um and they also
 
01:14:09.070 --> 01:14:09.080 align:start position:0%
rolled out DocuSign during covid which
 
01:14:11.750 --> 01:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
was um necessary because there were not
 
01:14:13.669 --> 01:14:13.679 align:start position:0%
people to come sign the contracts in
 
01:14:18.350 --> 01:14:18.360 align:start position:0%
person and also uh reduce the workload
 
01:14:21.430 --> 01:14:21.440 align:start position:0%
incredibly um so initial data is he's
 
01:14:24.350 --> 01:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
seeing a 53% reduction in cycle times
 
01:14:25.750 --> 01:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
for the execution phase of the
 
01:14:28.390 --> 01:14:28.400 align:start position:0%
Contracting P process and a 10%
 
01:14:30.270 --> 01:14:30.280 align:start position:0%
reduction in cycle times for the entire
 
01:14:32.350 --> 01:14:32.360 align:start position:0%
Contracting process which is quite
 
01:14:34.149 --> 01:14:34.159 align:start position:0%
amazing and quite frankly the only
 
01:14:38.030 --> 01:14:38.040 align:start position:0%
reason why that team has not
 
01:14:40.590 --> 01:14:40.600 align:start position:0%
um or that why that team has been able
 
01:14:43.070 --> 01:14:43.080 align:start position:0%
to survive through covid is because he
 
01:14:45.550 --> 01:14:45.560 align:start position:0%
has managed to put efficiencies in place
 
01:14:47.629 --> 01:14:47.639 align:start position:0%
to allow us to continue to work with the
 
01:14:49.550 --> 01:14:49.560 align:start position:0%
same amount of people while increasing
 
01:14:51.629 --> 01:14:51.639 align:start position:0%
the number of
 
01:14:53.990 --> 01:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
contracts they also substantially
 
01:14:56.070 --> 01:14:56.080 align:start position:0%
reduced the number of retroactive
 
01:14:59.669 --> 01:14:59.679 align:start position:0%
contracts from July 18 to March 2020
 
01:15:01.709 --> 01:15:01.719 align:start position:0%
you'll notice that that does say March
 
01:15:04.270 --> 01:15:04.280 align:start position:0%
2020 because as soon as covid happened
 
01:15:06.310 --> 01:15:06.320 align:start position:0%
virtually every covid contract is
 
01:15:09.270 --> 01:15:09.280 align:start position:0%
retroactive so that has impacted the
 
01:15:11.629 --> 01:15:11.639 align:start position:0%
retroactive percentage greatly however
 
01:15:14.350 --> 01:15:14.360 align:start position:0%
we do expect that postco that rate will
 
01:15:20.350 --> 01:15:20.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:22.950 --> 01:15:22.960 align:start position:0%
representative so
 
01:15:25.790 --> 01:15:25.800 align:start position:0%
um are we having to pay a premium for
 
01:15:27.910 --> 01:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
these contracts because we had to go
 
01:15:30.709 --> 01:15:30.719 align:start position:0%
retroactive or are they still coming in
 
01:15:33.149 --> 01:15:33.159 align:start position:0%
at the the expected
 
01:15:35.229 --> 01:15:35.239 align:start position:0%
costs I think that they've still been
 
01:15:37.830 --> 01:15:37.840 align:start position:0%
coming in at the expected cost so having
 
01:15:39.830 --> 01:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
been at the Emergency Operations Center
 
01:15:43.910 --> 01:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
since uh March of last year um I was
 
01:15:45.990 --> 01:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
part a lot part of a lot of those
 
01:15:47.990 --> 01:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
discussions with the commissioner and
 
01:15:50.229 --> 01:15:50.239 align:start position:0%
contractors and I believe that even
 
01:15:51.830 --> 01:15:51.840 align:start position:0%
though we had to make decisions in a
 
01:15:54.310 --> 01:15:54.320 align:start position:0%
matter of days sometimes hours that we
 
01:15:56.470 --> 01:15:56.480 align:start position:0%
still worked really hard to make sure
 
01:15:58.030 --> 01:15:58.040 align:start position:0%
that we were getting a reasonable rate
 
01:16:00.070 --> 01:16:00.080 align:start position:0%
and not being taken advantage
 
01:16:03.270 --> 01:16:03.280 align:start position:0%
of thank
 
01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:05.830 align:start position:0%
of thank
you

01:16:05.830 --> 01:16:05.840 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:16:08.790 --> 01:16:08.800 align:start position:0%
um as we discussed yesterday or an hour
 
01:16:12.270 --> 01:16:12.280 align:start position:0%
ago um we have changed the way we work
 
01:16:15.270 --> 01:16:15.280 align:start position:0%
on the budget um to look at revenue and
 
01:16:19.910 --> 01:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
complete monthly uh projections um and
 
01:16:21.790 --> 01:16:21.800 align:start position:0%
our current project for the division is
 
01:16:25.270 --> 01:16:25.280 align:start position:0%
rewriting our policies and procedures
 
01:16:27.030 --> 01:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
and the last accomplishment I wanted to
 
01:16:29.990 --> 01:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
mention is that uh we have created a
 
01:16:32.990 --> 01:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
finance academy uh to create training
 
01:16:35.229 --> 01:16:35.239 align:start position:0%
modules to ensure staff are onboarded
 
01:16:37.430 --> 01:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
with basic information and we're working
 
01:16:39.510 --> 01:16:39.520 align:start position:0%
on the future models which will ensure
 
01:16:41.550 --> 01:16:41.560 align:start position:0%
knowledge transfer and that more than
 
01:16:44.910 --> 01:16:44.920 align:start position:0%
one person can perform specific work or
 
01:16:46.910 --> 01:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
seccession planning if you will so
 
01:16:50.470 --> 01:16:50.480 align:start position:0%
that's an exciting project for
 
01:16:53.149 --> 01:16:53.159 align:start position:0%
us one of the things that you asked for
 
01:16:54.590 --> 01:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
is what would happen if the budget was
 
01:16:56.629 --> 01:16:56.639 align:start position:0%
in increased 5% and what would happen if
 
01:16:59.430 --> 01:16:59.440 align:start position:0%
it was decreased 5% so uh for starters
 
01:17:01.870 --> 01:17:01.880 align:start position:0%
if it was increased 5% we do have eight
 
01:17:04.669 --> 01:17:04.679 align:start position:0%
unfunded positions in the division of
 
01:17:06.350 --> 01:17:06.360 align:start position:0%
finance so that would be my first
 
01:17:08.830 --> 01:17:08.840 align:start position:0%
priority would be to fund those eight
 
01:17:11.669 --> 01:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
positions um the second thing I would
 
01:17:14.030 --> 01:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
look at would be additional software to
 
01:17:16.430 --> 01:17:16.440 align:start position:0%
support the contracts process um there
 
01:17:17.870 --> 01:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
is some software out there that could
 
01:17:19.870 --> 01:17:19.880 align:start position:0%
make us even more efficient so that is
 
01:17:21.189 --> 01:17:21.199 align:start position:0%
something that I would certainly look
 
01:17:24.030 --> 01:17:24.040 align:start position:0%
for or look at um and then of course
 
01:17:25.590 --> 01:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
additional positions because as you look
 
01:17:27.790 --> 01:17:27.800 align:start position:0%
at our budget you will see that we are
 
01:17:31.030 --> 01:17:31.040 align:start position:0%
mainly made up of positions um and what
 
01:17:33.189 --> 01:17:33.199 align:start position:0%
would happen if the finance budget was
 
01:17:36.550 --> 01:17:36.560 align:start position:0%
reduced we would have to reduce um the
 
01:17:41.390 --> 01:17:41.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:44.790 --> 01:17:44.800 align:start position:0%
funded yes representative so so I would
 
01:17:48.550 --> 01:17:48.560 align:start position:0%
be interested um not not urgently but
 
01:17:50.550 --> 01:17:50.560 align:start position:0%
I'd be interested in this software to
 
01:17:53.790 --> 01:17:53.800 align:start position:0%
support the contract process if we if if
 
01:17:55.830 --> 01:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
we can work with with you to find ways
 
01:17:57.229 --> 01:17:57.239 align:start position:0%
for you to gain
 
01:18:00.189 --> 01:18:00.199 align:start position:0%
efficiencies uh I I would like to uh see
 
01:18:03.149 --> 01:18:03.159 align:start position:0%
if we can support that sure what I will
 
01:18:06.669 --> 01:18:06.679 align:start position:0%
do um is I will have Nathan white put
 
01:18:08.910 --> 01:18:08.920 align:start position:0%
together um something for you on that
 
01:18:12.070 --> 01:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
and send it over I'd be interested in
 
01:18:14.750 --> 01:18:14.760 align:start position:0%
what features or functions we don't have
 
01:18:16.510 --> 01:18:16.520 align:start position:0%
now that we would be obtaining with
 
01:18:19.470 --> 01:18:19.480 align:start position:0%
different software sure yes I can
 
01:18:22.430 --> 01:18:22.440 align:start position:0%
absolutely get that to
 
01:18:25.510 --> 01:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
you so as I mentioned there uh in many
 
01:18:27.790 --> 01:18:27.800 align:start position:0%
of the other presentations there are
 
01:18:29.910 --> 01:18:29.920 align:start position:0%
additional slides but they were less
 
01:18:33.149 --> 01:18:33.159 align:start position:0%
applicable to um my division so I did
 
01:18:35.629 --> 01:18:35.639 align:start position:0%
not include them so the last slide you
 
01:18:38.350 --> 01:18:38.360 align:start position:0%
will see in each section and when we get
 
01:18:40.750 --> 01:18:40.760 align:start position:0%
to like division of Behavioral Health
 
01:18:44.430 --> 01:18:44.440 align:start position:0%
this is at every Bureau is okay now here
 
01:18:47.070 --> 01:18:47.080 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry this is actually positions
 
01:18:49.030 --> 01:18:49.040 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm jumping ahead a couple of
 
01:18:51.149 --> 01:18:51.159 align:start position:0%
slides this is positions so there are
 
01:18:53.950 --> 01:18:53.960 align:start position:0%
144 positions in finance um what I would
 
01:18:55.709 --> 01:18:55.719 align:start position:0%
mention is that the Finance teams at New
 
01:18:57.590 --> 01:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital and Glen Cliffe both
 
01:18:59.470 --> 01:18:59.480 align:start position:0%
report to the CFO of New Hampshire
 
01:19:01.910 --> 01:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
hospital who is Joe kisy you will meet
 
01:19:04.830 --> 01:19:04.840 align:start position:0%
him um the week after next he reports to
 
01:19:06.910 --> 01:19:06.920 align:start position:0%
me as a dotted line because of course
 
01:19:08.430 --> 01:19:08.440 align:start position:0%
their finances are still part of the
 
01:19:10.110 --> 01:19:10.120 align:start position:0%
department and I am still responsible
 
01:19:11.830 --> 01:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
for the finances of the entire
 
01:19:14.310 --> 01:19:14.320 align:start position:0%
department um but those Finance staff
 
01:19:15.990 --> 01:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
because of the nature of working in a
 
01:19:18.350 --> 01:19:18.360 align:start position:0%
facility like a hospital they do report
 
01:19:22.990 --> 01:19:23.000 align:start position:0%
to the CEO of the hospital and of
 
01:19:25.030 --> 01:19:25.040 align:start position:0%
lliff this is to just get give you a
 
01:19:26.510 --> 01:19:26.520 align:start position:0%
sense of the federal funds and general
 
01:19:28.990 --> 01:19:29.000 align:start position:0%
funds you will see this slide in all of
 
01:19:32.070 --> 01:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
the presentations 20 and 21 looks a
 
01:19:34.390 --> 01:19:34.400 align:start position:0%
little funny and the reason for that
 
01:19:37.550 --> 01:19:37.560 align:start position:0%
that green block is other funds and if
 
01:19:39.550 --> 01:19:39.560 align:start position:0%
you um have been watching the press
 
01:19:41.870 --> 01:19:41.880 align:start position:0%
conferences by the governor you have
 
01:19:43.750 --> 01:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
heard that New Hampshire has been
 
01:19:47.669 --> 01:19:47.679 align:start position:0%
helping the VA the uh US Veterans
 
01:19:51.350 --> 01:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
Administration acquire um PPE which is
 
01:19:53.270 --> 01:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
personal protective equipment although I
 
01:19:55.310 --> 01:19:55.320 align:start position:0%
think everyone knows that acronym by now
 
01:20:01.070 --> 01:20:01.080 align:start position:0%
thank you co um and so to uh do that the
 
01:20:05.430 --> 01:20:05.440 align:start position:0%
department um both purchases as well as
 
01:20:08.350 --> 01:20:08.360 align:start position:0%
receives the reimbursement from the VA
 
01:20:11.629 --> 01:20:11.639 align:start position:0%
and we did that within the uh Finance
 
01:20:13.790 --> 01:20:13.800 align:start position:0%
accounting unit it was just a good place
 
01:20:16.709 --> 01:20:16.719 align:start position:0%
to put it we created a class line and
 
01:20:18.470 --> 01:20:18.480 align:start position:0%
that is where those funds flow in and
 
01:20:20.669 --> 01:20:20.679 align:start position:0%
out of and so that's why there's this
 
01:20:23.390 --> 01:20:23.400 align:start position:0%
weird uh anomaly of other funds
 
01:20:25.030 --> 01:20:25.040 align:start position:0%
otherwise you can see that our General
 
01:20:27.470 --> 01:20:27.480 align:start position:0%
and federal funds are pretty steady um
 
01:20:30.149 --> 01:20:30.159 align:start position:0%
from 18 to
 
01:20:32.430 --> 01:20:32.440 align:start position:0%
2223 and here is what I was mentioning
 
01:20:36.350 --> 01:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
this last slide um is where we will list
 
01:20:38.229 --> 01:20:38.239 align:start position:0%
the accounting units related to the
 
01:20:41.030 --> 01:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
section that we just reviewed um as well
 
01:20:43.629 --> 01:20:43.639 align:start position:0%
as the budget book page which in this
 
01:20:46.950 --> 01:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
case is 1162 which um representative
 
01:20:49.790 --> 01:20:49.800 align:start position:0%
Earth will remember well is not the PDF
 
01:20:55.870 --> 01:20:55.880 align:start position:0%
page but the page on the um budget book
 
01:20:58.070 --> 01:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
um there's also the briefing book page
 
01:20:59.750 --> 01:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
number on here which you will have
 
01:21:01.709 --> 01:21:01.719 align:start position:0%
tomorrow so you'll be able to refer to
 
01:21:04.990 --> 01:21:05.000 align:start position:0%
page 231 to see the detail on that
 
01:21:06.870 --> 01:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
accounting unit so this is where I would
 
01:21:09.430 --> 01:21:09.440 align:start position:0%
ask the question whether you would like
 
01:21:13.310 --> 01:21:13.320 align:start position:0%
to um look at this accounting unit now
 
01:21:16.030 --> 01:21:16.040 align:start position:0%
which I can actually pull up um and
 
01:21:18.270 --> 01:21:18.280 align:start position:0%
screen share or if you would like to go
 
01:21:20.149 --> 01:21:20.159 align:start position:0%
through more of the oon presentations
 
01:21:25.430 --> 01:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:27.629 --> 01:21:27.639 align:start position:0%
Let's uh let's defer looking at the
 
01:21:32.149 --> 01:21:32.159 align:start position:0%
detail until we can just go through it
 
01:21:36.870 --> 01:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
okay so um from here I will go ahead and
 
01:21:40.070 --> 01:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
um turn things over to Lori
 
01:21:43.310 --> 01:21:43.320 align:start position:0%
Weaver thank you um Kevin may we bring
 
01:21:45.870 --> 01:21:45.880 align:start position:0%
in people from I you say the other side
 
01:21:47.470 --> 01:21:47.480 align:start position:0%
it makes me think of the dark side with
 
01:21:50.189 --> 01:21:50.199 align:start position:0%
Star Wars can we bring in people from uh
 
01:21:52.709 --> 01:21:52.719 align:start position:0%
the folks listed here Stacy Silva paa
 
01:22:03.030 --> 01:22:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:05.990 --> 01:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
you as Kevin is doing that I could
 
01:22:08.790 --> 01:22:08.800 align:start position:0%
probably get started uh with a couple of
 
01:22:10.950 --> 01:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
things I I did want to just go back for
 
01:22:13.750 --> 01:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
a second representative Edwards on your
 
01:22:15.950 --> 01:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
comment about the software uh for the
 
01:22:19.070 --> 01:22:19.080 align:start position:0%
contracts unit I would also recommend
 
01:22:20.950 --> 01:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
that you ask that question to the
 
01:22:23.070 --> 01:22:23.080 align:start position:0%
Department of administrative Services
 
01:22:26.189 --> 01:22:26.199 align:start position:0%
who has budget Ed and been working on
 
01:22:30.310 --> 01:22:30.320 align:start position:0%
procurement of a Statewide uh uh
 
01:22:33.110 --> 01:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
procurement purchasing system um for All
 
01:22:35.270 --> 01:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
State agencies um so they would be able
 
01:22:37.590 --> 01:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
to advise you where that's at we have
 
01:22:39.310 --> 01:22:39.320 align:start position:0%
been a part of that there's been a
 
01:22:40.950 --> 01:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
challenge I think for us because our
 
01:22:43.430 --> 01:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
department is so large and so complex
 
01:22:45.550 --> 01:22:45.560 align:start position:0%
some of the things uh we had a little
 
01:22:47.229 --> 01:22:47.239 align:start position:0%
bit of issues and Nathan has done a
 
01:22:49.990 --> 01:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
phenomenal job of working around uh
 
01:22:51.669 --> 01:22:51.679 align:start position:0%
while we wait for that system to get
 
01:22:54.149 --> 01:22:54.159 align:start position:0%
things done so um I just just make a
 
01:22:56.110 --> 01:22:56.120 align:start position:0%
note that there is more about that that
 
01:22:58.189 --> 01:22:58.199 align:start position:0%
commissioner Arling house could could
 
01:23:02.030 --> 01:23:02.040 align:start position:0%
address um Kevin do we have everybody
 
01:23:05.149 --> 01:23:05.159 align:start position:0%
yes is Paula Booth oh there she you do
 
01:23:08.870 --> 01:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um we're gonna start out
 
01:23:12.030 --> 01:23:12.040 align:start position:0%
um with human resources and one of the
 
01:23:13.830 --> 01:23:13.840 align:start position:0%
slides that Karen had mentioned that
 
01:23:15.910 --> 01:23:15.920 align:start position:0%
what we decided to address on a more
 
01:23:19.430 --> 01:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
Global level was succession planning um
 
01:23:21.470 --> 01:23:21.480 align:start position:0%
and that I will address that in this
 
01:23:23.750 --> 01:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
section um my name is Lori Weaver I've
 
01:23:25.590 --> 01:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
been with the Department for about 24
 
01:23:28.310 --> 01:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
years now currently Deputy Commissioner
 
01:23:29.910 --> 01:23:29.920 align:start position:0%
I've had various roles within the
 
01:23:31.910 --> 01:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
department in that time mostly all in
 
01:23:33.830 --> 01:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
director leadership or associate
 
01:23:36.629 --> 01:23:36.639 align:start position:0%
commissioner roles um during that time
 
01:23:39.830 --> 01:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
Stacy Silver who's on the panel here as
 
01:23:42.790 --> 01:23:42.800 align:start position:0%
well as our recent human uh Resources
 
01:23:45.990 --> 01:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
Director our director of 20 one years
 
01:23:48.709 --> 01:23:48.719 align:start position:0%
just retired last December uh great for
 
01:23:50.390 --> 01:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
her and not so great for us but we found
 
01:23:53.950 --> 01:23:53.960 align:start position:0%
Stacy Sila who has uh been with UNH uh
 
01:23:56.189 --> 01:23:56.199 align:start position:0%
for 20 years as our HR Director so it
 
01:23:58.270 --> 01:23:58.280 align:start position:0%
was a nice transition for Stacy to step
 
01:24:00.910 --> 01:24:00.920 align:start position:0%
right in into our system and keep us
 
01:24:03.550 --> 01:24:03.560 align:start position:0%
moving we have Paula Booth who is our
 
01:24:06.390 --> 01:24:06.400 align:start position:0%
employee assistance uh program director
 
01:24:07.709 --> 01:24:07.719 align:start position:0%
and we have Dave clap who's our
 
01:24:09.790 --> 01:24:09.800 align:start position:0%
facilities director so as I go through
 
01:24:11.510 --> 01:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
these pieces if there's any questions
 
01:24:14.070 --> 01:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
that I can't answer I may ask them um to
 
01:24:17.310 --> 01:24:17.320 align:start position:0%
jump in but I hopefully can answer them
 
01:24:20.189 --> 01:24:20.199 align:start position:0%
um in terms of succession planning um
 
01:24:22.510 --> 01:24:22.520 align:start position:0%
many of you are aware that we're we
 
01:24:24.709 --> 01:24:24.719 align:start position:0%
operate in a unionized environment which
 
01:24:26.470 --> 01:24:26.480 align:start position:0%
which provides some challenges for us
 
01:24:28.189 --> 01:24:28.199 align:start position:0%
we're often told that we can't use the
 
01:24:30.669 --> 01:24:30.679 align:start position:0%
word succession planning um because we
 
01:24:32.990 --> 01:24:33.000 align:start position:0%
cannot Target people for jobs because we
 
01:24:35.070 --> 01:24:35.080 align:start position:0%
have to post our jobs and give fair and
 
01:24:37.709 --> 01:24:37.719 align:start position:0%
equal opportunity to all who certify for
 
01:24:40.149 --> 01:24:40.159 align:start position:0%
any job that they apply for so we talk
 
01:24:42.030 --> 01:24:42.040 align:start position:0%
more about our bench and building our
 
01:24:44.870 --> 01:24:44.880 align:start position:0%
bench um and looking at how having
 
01:24:46.830 --> 01:24:46.840 align:start position:0%
people that could apply for those
 
01:24:49.270 --> 01:24:49.280 align:start position:0%
positions when key leadership and other
 
01:24:52.430 --> 01:24:52.440 align:start position:0%
positions vacate or become vacant I will
 
01:24:55.470 --> 01:24:55.480 align:start position:0%
tell you that our plan right now after
 
01:24:59.070 --> 01:24:59.080 align:start position:0%
2020 is to try to fill those 765
 
01:25:01.030 --> 01:25:01.040 align:start position:0%
positions we have been decimated by
 
01:25:03.270 --> 01:25:03.280 align:start position:0%
covid with our Workforce uh we had a
 
01:25:06.310 --> 01:25:06.320 align:start position:0%
hiring freeze that lasted nine months um
 
01:25:08.550 --> 01:25:08.560 align:start position:0%
so when we have as many programs and
 
01:25:11.629 --> 01:25:11.639 align:start position:0%
services that we have and we're down 760
 
01:25:14.070 --> 01:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
uh positions it hurts uh it hurts a lot
 
01:25:16.750 --> 01:25:16.760 align:start position:0%
so safc's got a heavy emphasis right now
 
01:25:18.070 --> 01:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
now that the hiring freeze has been
 
01:25:21.070 --> 01:25:21.080 align:start position:0%
lifted on recruitment get folks in the
 
01:25:23.270 --> 01:25:23.280 align:start position:0%
door let's beef up our staff and then we
 
01:25:26.629 --> 01:25:26.639 align:start position:0%
will focus to that retention strategy um
 
01:25:29.229 --> 01:25:29.239 align:start position:0%
to obviously have people stay and grow
 
01:25:31.070 --> 01:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
within the department so we have a
 
01:25:33.030 --> 01:25:33.040 align:start position:0%
benefit I think because we're such a
 
01:25:35.109 --> 01:25:35.119 align:start position:0%
large Department you could come in
 
01:25:38.189 --> 01:25:38.199 align:start position:0%
virtually in any division maybe spend
 
01:25:40.350 --> 01:25:40.360 align:start position:0%
some time there and then you could grow
 
01:25:42.629 --> 01:25:42.639 align:start position:0%
and transition to another division so we
 
01:25:44.270 --> 01:25:44.280 align:start position:0%
are retaining you as a department
 
01:25:46.310 --> 01:25:46.320 align:start position:0%
employee but you're getting a skill set
 
01:25:47.830 --> 01:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
maybe you're an adult on elderly
 
01:25:49.709 --> 01:25:49.719 align:start position:0%
services worker or your child support
 
01:25:52.149 --> 01:25:52.159 align:start position:0%
worker or your child uh welfare worker
 
01:25:54.830 --> 01:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
or you work in finance for Ken round
 
01:25:56.669 --> 01:25:56.679 align:start position:0%
um there's plenty of opportunities so
 
01:25:58.550 --> 01:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
heavy heavy emphas emphasis on
 
01:26:01.470 --> 01:26:01.480 align:start position:0%
professional development um not only uh
 
01:26:03.390 --> 01:26:03.400 align:start position:0%
paying for classes when it's appropriate
 
01:26:05.030 --> 01:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
but also providing our own internal
 
01:26:07.709 --> 01:26:07.719 align:start position:0%
training programs yes representative
 
01:26:12.030 --> 01:26:12.040 align:start position:0%
Edwards so miss Weaver I I um I'd like
 
01:26:14.270 --> 01:26:14.280 align:start position:0%
to know how what you're thinking about
 
01:26:18.109 --> 01:26:18.119 align:start position:0%
the onboarding of that many people in an
 
01:26:21.350 --> 01:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
era of covid and social distancing I it
 
01:26:24.390 --> 01:26:24.400 align:start position:0%
just seems to me that the traditional
 
01:26:26.790 --> 01:26:26.800 align:start position:0%
ways in which large organizations have
 
01:26:29.830 --> 01:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
brought people in and gotten them to
 
01:26:32.629 --> 01:26:32.639 align:start position:0%
understand the the culture and who's who
 
01:26:34.750 --> 01:26:34.760 align:start position:0%
and who they can trust and who their
 
01:26:37.750 --> 01:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
peers are all of that is is out the
 
01:26:41.750 --> 01:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
window now uh in a in a zoom world so
 
01:26:44.070 --> 01:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious if we if we go on a
 
01:26:48.149 --> 01:26:48.159 align:start position:0%
massive successful hiring Rampage how
 
01:26:50.149 --> 01:26:50.159 align:start position:0%
are we really going to integrate those
 
01:26:53.629 --> 01:26:53.639 align:start position:0%
people into your organization in a way
 
01:26:56.430 --> 01:26:56.440 align:start position:0%
that's effective and doesn't cause
 
01:26:59.350 --> 01:26:59.360 align:start position:0%
people to just get upset and leave yeah
 
01:27:00.790 --> 01:27:00.800 align:start position:0%
it's a great question I'm glad you
 
01:27:01.990 --> 01:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
brought it up it's what we've been
 
01:27:04.229 --> 01:27:04.239 align:start position:0%
working on during this whole time of Co
 
01:27:06.750 --> 01:27:06.760 align:start position:0%
from a human resource perspective is how
 
01:27:09.990 --> 01:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
do we allow people to work remotely but
 
01:27:11.910 --> 01:27:11.920 align:start position:0%
stay connected right that's that's been
 
01:27:13.990 --> 01:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
the big challenge for us I will tell you
 
01:27:17.109 --> 01:27:17.119 align:start position:0%
50% of our Workforce is Direct Care it
 
01:27:19.590 --> 01:27:19.600 align:start position:0%
is those case workers out in the field
 
01:27:22.870 --> 01:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
so our numbers are fairly good uh in
 
01:27:24.750 --> 01:27:24.760 align:start position:0%
terms of um
 
01:27:27.189 --> 01:27:27.199 align:start position:0%
we have a 20% vacancy rate overall but
 
01:27:29.350 --> 01:27:29.360 align:start position:0%
in terms of our service areas we're
 
01:27:30.830 --> 01:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
we're holding steady we've had to
 
01:27:32.950 --> 01:27:32.960 align:start position:0%
recruit people during the time of covid
 
01:27:35.270 --> 01:27:35.280 align:start position:0%
and it has been extremely challenging
 
01:27:37.189 --> 01:27:37.199 align:start position:0%
we've had to change practices we've had
 
01:27:40.109 --> 01:27:40.119 align:start position:0%
to take on safety measures and really
 
01:27:41.590 --> 01:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
it's like a paradigm shift right
 
01:27:43.470 --> 01:27:43.480 align:start position:0%
everything of the way that we have done
 
01:27:47.510 --> 01:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
it H has changed so in terms of right
 
01:27:50.390 --> 01:27:50.400 align:start position:0%
now our we're probably the probably one
 
01:27:52.109 --> 01:27:52.119 align:start position:0%
of the state agencies that have the most
 
01:27:54.189 --> 01:27:54.199 align:start position:0%
people actually coming to work with with
 
01:27:55.910 --> 01:27:55.920 align:start position:0%
restrictions we do have a fair amount of
 
01:27:59.550 --> 01:27:59.560 align:start position:0%
our Workforce working remotely we have
 
01:28:02.430 --> 01:28:02.440 align:start position:0%
uh such an Innovative team at HR we had
 
01:28:04.470 --> 01:28:04.480 align:start position:0%
our organizational development uh
 
01:28:07.070 --> 01:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
administrator basically her Focus was
 
01:28:09.149 --> 01:28:09.159 align:start position:0%
your job is to keep people integrated
 
01:28:10.830 --> 01:28:10.840 align:start position:0%
during this time of covid how do you
 
01:28:13.310 --> 01:28:13.320 align:start position:0%
teach people to be connected on Zoom how
 
01:28:15.629 --> 01:28:15.639 align:start position:0%
do we onboard how do we Orient you'll
 
01:28:17.030 --> 01:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
see when I go through some of these
 
01:28:18.790 --> 01:28:18.800 align:start position:0%
slides I'll give you some numbers of how
 
01:28:20.950 --> 01:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
many face-to-face orientations we have
 
01:28:22.910 --> 01:28:22.920 align:start position:0%
before covid hit and then you'll see
 
01:28:24.270 --> 01:28:24.280 align:start position:0%
everything after that had to be be
 
01:28:25.990 --> 01:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
virtual how do we keep those people
 
01:28:29.550 --> 01:28:29.560 align:start position:0%
connected so we are um finding extreme
 
01:28:31.830 --> 01:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
innovative ways to do that I think as
 
01:28:33.149 --> 01:28:33.159 align:start position:0%
the commissioner mentioned you know
 
01:28:34.669 --> 01:28:34.679 align:start position:0%
things are winding down a little bit
 
01:28:36.470 --> 01:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
with covid if we can get to a steady
 
01:28:38.870 --> 01:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
state and folks are getting vaccinated
 
01:28:41.070 --> 01:28:41.080 align:start position:0%
it is Our intention to find the balance
 
01:28:43.390 --> 01:28:43.400 align:start position:0%
of who can stay working remotely and who
 
01:28:45.030 --> 01:28:45.040 align:start position:0%
should be coming back in the office and
 
01:28:46.790 --> 01:28:46.800 align:start position:0%
keeping those connections so it's a
 
01:28:48.790 --> 01:28:48.800 align:start position:0%
day-to-day uh challenge that we're
 
01:28:52.070 --> 01:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
working on right now um so I appreciate
 
01:28:54.430 --> 01:28:54.440 align:start position:0%
that I appreciate the question um Karen
 
01:28:59.270 --> 01:28:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:02.229 --> 01:29:02.239 align:start position:0%
slide please Lorry actually just gave
 
01:29:03.870 --> 01:29:03.880 align:start position:0%
you control you should be able to go to
 
01:29:05.470 --> 01:29:05.480 align:start position:0%
the next oh I have
 
01:29:08.189 --> 01:29:08.199 align:start position:0%
control oh that's awesome what do I do I
 
01:29:11.030 --> 01:29:11.040 align:start position:0%
just click it oh yeah perfect great now
 
01:29:12.430 --> 01:29:12.440 align:start position:0%
if I could just keep it to stay on one
 
01:29:15.350 --> 01:29:15.360 align:start position:0%
slide hang on I don't know where I am
 
01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:21.750 align:start position:0%
slide hang on I don't know where I am
what

01:29:21.750 --> 01:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:27.149 --> 01:29:27.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:29.430 --> 01:29:29.440 align:start position:0%
so for our mission of Human
 
01:29:32.510 --> 01:29:32.520 align:start position:0%
Resources basically our human resource
 
01:29:34.390 --> 01:29:34.400 align:start position:0%
looks to be a business partner with all
 
01:29:36.629 --> 01:29:36.639 align:start position:0%
of our program areas to be able to help
 
01:29:39.390 --> 01:29:39.400 align:start position:0%
them recruit and retain develop staff
 
01:29:42.350 --> 01:29:42.360 align:start position:0%
grow staff be invested in staff and have
 
01:29:44.390 --> 01:29:44.400 align:start position:0%
staff uh be satisfied and want to stay
 
01:29:46.430 --> 01:29:46.440 align:start position:0%
in their in their jobs and grow with the
 
01:29:49.390 --> 01:29:49.400 align:start position:0%
Department um our vision pretty much is
 
01:29:51.149 --> 01:29:51.159 align:start position:0%
is sort of what I was just speaking to
 
01:29:53.629 --> 01:29:53.639 align:start position:0%
is to be able to be transformative about
 
01:29:55.750 --> 01:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
how we do our business one of the
 
01:29:57.950 --> 01:29:57.960 align:start position:0%
challenges with state government is that
 
01:30:00.109 --> 01:30:00.119 align:start position:0%
it's it's been sort of rigid and or
 
01:30:02.830 --> 01:30:02.840 align:start position:0%
inflexible with some of our ability to
 
01:30:04.870 --> 01:30:04.880 align:start position:0%
do things differently Co really forced
 
01:30:06.510 --> 01:30:06.520 align:start position:0%
our hand on that and showed us that we
 
01:30:08.229 --> 01:30:08.239 align:start position:0%
could do things differently and we could
 
01:30:09.870 --> 01:30:09.880 align:start position:0%
still be as effective if not more
 
01:30:11.270 --> 01:30:11.280 align:start position:0%
effective so that's going to be a big
 
01:30:16.070 --> 01:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:18.470 --> 01:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
forward these are the key when we look
 
01:30:20.109 --> 01:30:20.119 align:start position:0%
at HR we look at obviously we have
 
01:30:21.590 --> 01:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
Recruitment and Retention we have our
 
01:30:24.030 --> 01:30:24.040 align:start position:0%
payroll benefits piece we have our
 
01:30:25.590 --> 01:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
organizational development training
 
01:30:26.950 --> 01:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
which is really getting in and working
 
01:30:28.310 --> 01:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
with work groups to become more
 
01:30:29.629 --> 01:30:29.639 align:start position:0%
efficient and more effective at what
 
01:30:31.950 --> 01:30:31.960 align:start position:0%
they do and obviously training our
 
01:30:33.910 --> 01:30:33.920 align:start position:0%
Workforce Development how many positions
 
01:30:35.430 --> 01:30:35.440 align:start position:0%
do we have do we have the right number
 
01:30:37.629 --> 01:30:37.639 align:start position:0%
of positions are they in the right
 
01:30:40.629 --> 01:30:40.639 align:start position:0%
area um and and growth as well as
 
01:30:42.149 --> 01:30:42.159 align:start position:0%
employee relations you can't have a
 
01:30:44.189 --> 01:30:44.199 align:start position:0%
large organization without um
 
01:30:46.629 --> 01:30:46.639 align:start position:0%
continuously managing employee relations
 
01:30:48.830 --> 01:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
they're in a circle format because each
 
01:30:51.070 --> 01:30:51.080 align:start position:0%
informs the other so as we learn about
 
01:30:53.270 --> 01:30:53.280 align:start position:0%
what kinds of issues employees may be
 
01:30:55.430 --> 01:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
having we look at how can we help train
 
01:30:57.030 --> 01:30:57.040 align:start position:0%
how do we train supervisors how do we
 
01:30:59.510 --> 01:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
train staff to sort of uh mitigate what
 
01:31:01.390 --> 01:31:01.400 align:start position:0%
those issues might be so this sort of
 
01:31:04.709 --> 01:31:04.719 align:start position:0%
all work together um for the various
 
01:31:07.950 --> 01:31:07.960 align:start position:0%
components um we have uh I think it was
 
01:31:12.709 --> 01:31:12.719 align:start position:0%
3200 something 3,260 something positions
 
01:31:14.950 --> 01:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
um that were was in the slide deck that
 
01:31:17.109 --> 01:31:17.119 align:start position:0%
the commissioner was on that breaks out
 
01:31:19.430 --> 01:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
to about our Workforce spread out over
 
01:31:22.310 --> 01:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
11 offices throughout the state so
 
01:31:24.270 --> 01:31:24.280 align:start position:0%
you'll see one through 11 that's what we
 
01:31:26.510 --> 01:31:26.520 align:start position:0%
call our district offices so we have all
 
01:31:28.470 --> 01:31:28.480 align:start position:0%
of our program services are offered
 
01:31:30.310 --> 01:31:30.320 align:start position:0%
through that for catchment areas as well
 
01:31:32.790 --> 01:31:32.800 align:start position:0%
as administrative Services as well we
 
01:31:34.750 --> 01:31:34.760 align:start position:0%
also have the what we call the Sops
 
01:31:36.870 --> 01:31:36.880 align:start position:0%
campus the State Office Park Campus
 
01:31:38.910 --> 01:31:38.920 align:start position:0%
which is um up on Pleasant Street we
 
01:31:41.070 --> 01:31:41.080 align:start position:0%
have a bunch of Office Buildings there
 
01:31:43.550 --> 01:31:43.560 align:start position:0%
as well as Haan drive we have um our
 
01:31:46.390 --> 01:31:46.400 align:start position:0%
public health is over at hazan drive and
 
01:31:49.830 --> 01:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
we also have three 247 uh facilities
 
01:31:52.350 --> 01:31:52.360 align:start position:0%
which is our Glen Cliff home uh senu
 
01:31:54.590 --> 01:31:54.600 align:start position:0%
Center and hampsh hospital so are are
 
01:31:57.350 --> 01:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
all of our 32 approximately 3200 staff
 
01:32:04.350 --> 01:32:04.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:06.310 --> 01:32:06.320 align:start position:0%
locations this I'm not going to go
 
01:32:07.990 --> 01:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
through each line here but this will
 
01:32:10.910 --> 01:32:10.920 align:start position:0%
give you an idea of the volume that our
 
01:32:13.629 --> 01:32:13.639 align:start position:0%
HR experiences in terms of new hires and
 
01:32:16.550 --> 01:32:16.560 align:start position:0%
transfers and training seats uh we have
 
01:32:20.149 --> 01:32:20.159 align:start position:0%
a pretty robust uh supervisory uh
 
01:32:21.669 --> 01:32:21.679 align:start position:0%
offerings where we have a certificate
 
01:32:23.390 --> 01:32:23.400 align:start position:0%
program we have a training series we
 
01:32:25.189 --> 01:32:25.199 align:start position:0%
have a round Round Table representative
 
01:32:27.470 --> 01:32:27.480 align:start position:0%
Edwards that round table was uh in
 
01:32:29.350 --> 01:32:29.360 align:start position:0%
response to co for a way to have
 
01:32:31.030 --> 01:32:31.040 align:start position:0%
supervisors come together once a week
 
01:32:32.390 --> 01:32:32.400 align:start position:0%
and talk about the challenges that they
 
01:32:34.709 --> 01:32:34.719 align:start position:0%
were having in a facilitated training
 
01:32:36.350 --> 01:32:36.360 align:start position:0%
environment it's been very very
 
01:32:38.750 --> 01:32:38.760 align:start position:0%
successful and it's scheduled to
 
01:32:41.790 --> 01:32:41.800 align:start position:0%
continue um we had about 12,000
 
01:32:44.310 --> 01:32:44.320 align:start position:0%
applications um over the last year you
 
01:32:46.350 --> 01:32:46.360 align:start position:0%
can imagine one unit processing that
 
01:32:48.109 --> 01:32:48.119 align:start position:0%
many employee applications is quite a
 
01:32:52.109 --> 01:32:52.119 align:start position:0%
bit um we established 122 positions of
 
01:32:54.310 --> 01:32:54.320 align:start position:0%
oftentimes many of them are uh temporary
 
01:32:56.390 --> 01:32:56.400 align:start position:0%
or permanent uh positions depending on
 
01:32:59.189 --> 01:32:59.199 align:start position:0%
what the need is um on redesigned
 
01:33:01.310 --> 01:33:01.320 align:start position:0%
onboarding to a virtual platform in
 
01:33:02.709 --> 01:33:02.719 align:start position:0%
response to
 
01:33:05.669 --> 01:33:05.679 align:start position:0%
covid and provided support to
 
01:33:09.550 --> 01:33:09.560 align:start position:0%
2752 DHHS managers so quite a busy
 
01:33:14.430 --> 01:33:14.440 align:start position:0%
Department um HR was instrumental in
 
01:33:18.830 --> 01:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
uh not only helping us identify uh for
 
01:33:20.870 --> 01:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
Co there was a call that went out from
 
01:33:23.950 --> 01:33:23.960 align:start position:0%
Employment Security or from um the
 
01:33:26.070 --> 01:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
governor's office in terms of volunteers
 
01:33:27.950 --> 01:33:27.960 align:start position:0%
and this our HR helped coordinate who
 
01:33:30.030 --> 01:33:30.040 align:start position:0%
are those folks going to be in in human
 
01:33:31.709 --> 01:33:31.719 align:start position:0%
health and human resources that could
 
01:33:34.750 --> 01:33:34.760 align:start position:0%
step up and help meet that need um as
 
01:33:36.830 --> 01:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
well as help with all of the um
 
01:33:38.470 --> 01:33:38.480 align:start position:0%
procurements that needed to happen in
 
01:33:42.070 --> 01:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
terms of Staffing and a augmenting
 
01:33:44.669 --> 01:33:44.679 align:start position:0%
staff um so there's a there's a list of
 
01:33:46.149 --> 01:33:46.159 align:start position:0%
accomplishments here but I think even
 
01:33:48.470 --> 01:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
just the first two boxes speak to the
 
01:33:50.430 --> 01:33:50.440 align:start position:0%
volume that happens within our within
 
01:33:54.430 --> 01:33:54.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:55.950 --> 01:33:55.960 align:start position:0%
some challenges I think we've sort of
 
01:33:58.149 --> 01:33:58.159 align:start position:0%
talked about them is that modality shift
 
01:34:00.030 --> 01:34:00.040 align:start position:0%
for the new employee orientation and
 
01:34:03.149 --> 01:34:03.159 align:start position:0%
shifting to that virtual platform um the
 
01:34:04.590 --> 01:34:04.600 align:start position:0%
collection of documents when you're
 
01:34:06.350 --> 01:34:06.360 align:start position:0%
hiring somebody new for covid was
 
01:34:07.790 --> 01:34:07.800 align:start position:0%
challenging because we couldn't have
 
01:34:09.229 --> 01:34:09.239 align:start position:0%
that face Toof face and how are we going
 
01:34:13.149 --> 01:34:13.159 align:start position:0%
to do that uh our hiring process also uh
 
01:34:15.430 --> 01:34:15.440 align:start position:0%
took a little bit of a change so I I'm
 
01:34:16.790 --> 01:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
sure you're well aware that the
 
01:34:19.470 --> 01:34:19.480 align:start position:0%
divisional personnel which sits at admin
 
01:34:21.590 --> 01:34:21.600 align:start position:0%
Services is sort of the mothership for
 
01:34:24.350 --> 01:34:24.360 align:start position:0%
all of the state agencies so they can
 
01:34:26.510 --> 01:34:26.520 align:start position:0%
give us Direction and we have to follow
 
01:34:28.990 --> 01:34:29.000 align:start position:0%
it so they actually change made a change
 
01:34:31.030 --> 01:34:31.040 align:start position:0%
to the hiring process which actually
 
01:34:32.669 --> 01:34:32.679 align:start position:0%
made it a little bit more challenging
 
01:34:34.590 --> 01:34:34.600 align:start position:0%
for us to meet our goals so that's been
 
01:34:36.990 --> 01:34:37.000 align:start position:0%
a challenge to try to meet those uh
 
01:34:38.830 --> 01:34:38.840 align:start position:0%
requirements we're doing it but it's a
 
01:34:42.270 --> 01:34:42.280 align:start position:0%
little hard um as well as uh working out
 
01:34:44.590 --> 01:34:44.600 align:start position:0%
how do we figure it our Workforce that's
 
01:34:46.870 --> 01:34:46.880 align:start position:0%
out there working tell work how do we
 
01:34:48.629 --> 01:34:48.639 align:start position:0%
know they're productive what are the
 
01:34:50.430 --> 01:34:50.440 align:start position:0%
what is their output on any given day
 
01:34:52.830 --> 01:34:52.840 align:start position:0%
our services being delivered we spent a
 
01:34:54.950 --> 01:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
lot of time working with hrn our program
 
01:34:56.950 --> 01:34:56.960 align:start position:0%
to be able to document actions of our
 
01:34:59.229 --> 01:34:59.239 align:start position:0%
staff and to be able to show that staff
 
01:35:01.109 --> 01:35:01.119 align:start position:0%
were producing staff were staying
 
01:35:08.070 --> 01:35:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:11.750 --> 01:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
trained so our key leadership Stacy
 
01:35:13.590 --> 01:35:13.600 align:start position:0%
Silver who is on the line as our
 
01:35:16.109 --> 01:35:16.119 align:start position:0%
director we have uh Heidi Jackson Ryan
 
01:35:17.910 --> 01:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
who oversees our benefits and payroll
 
01:35:21.030 --> 01:35:21.040 align:start position:0%
and that does include um our FMLA Family
 
01:35:23.910 --> 01:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
Medical Leave Act um and and
 
01:35:26.270 --> 01:35:26.280 align:start position:0%
accommodations Lorie spring is our
 
01:35:28.950 --> 01:35:28.960 align:start position:0%
Workforce Development coordinator Rob
 
01:35:31.470 --> 01:35:31.480 align:start position:0%
Barry does a lot with our Ada and
 
01:35:34.510 --> 01:35:34.520 align:start position:0%
accommodations um and Virginia lever J
 
01:35:37.149 --> 01:35:37.159 align:start position:0%
Virginia lever is our odts administrator
 
01:35:39.109 --> 01:35:39.119 align:start position:0%
organizational development and Training
 
01:35:42.109 --> 01:35:42.119 align:start position:0%
Services uh person and Erica Kelly Works
 
01:35:43.990 --> 01:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
helps with recruitment so that's our
 
01:35:46.310 --> 01:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
leadership team in
 
01:35:50.470 --> 01:35:50.480 align:start position:0%
HR quick education question there uh as
 
01:35:54.109 --> 01:35:54.119 align:start position:0%
I look at at at numbers is New
 
01:35:57.310 --> 01:35:57.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's style that the bigger the
 
01:36:00.070 --> 01:36:00.080 align:start position:0%
number the more senior they are or is it
 
01:36:02.310 --> 01:36:02.320 align:start position:0%
the opposite where the lower the number
 
01:36:04.709 --> 01:36:04.719 align:start position:0%
the more senior they
 
01:36:07.709 --> 01:36:07.719 align:start position:0%
are when you're referencing number um
 
01:36:10.390 --> 01:36:10.400 align:start position:0%
what like like administrator two would
 
01:36:13.350 --> 01:36:13.360 align:start position:0%
an administrator two be more senior than
 
01:36:16.189 --> 01:36:16.199 align:start position:0%
an administrative one or vice
 
01:36:18.830 --> 01:36:18.840 align:start position:0%
versa yes so the classification is
 
01:36:20.750 --> 01:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
assist so if you take the first two
 
01:36:22.310 --> 01:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
right one would say oh assistant
 
01:36:23.990 --> 01:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
administrator is that hired an
 
01:36:25.510 --> 01:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
administrator to actually an
 
01:36:27.189 --> 01:36:27.199 align:start position:0%
administrator 2 is higher than an
 
01:36:30.070 --> 01:36:30.080 align:start position:0%
assistant administrator I believe so it
 
01:36:33.229 --> 01:36:33.239 align:start position:0%
goes one two three and four there is a a
 
01:36:35.310 --> 01:36:35.320 align:start position:0%
series for the administrator as there is
 
01:36:37.830 --> 01:36:37.840 align:start position:0%
for supervisors and other positions all
 
01:36:39.310 --> 01:36:39.320 align:start position:0%
right kind of like the military the
 
01:36:41.709 --> 01:36:41.719 align:start position:0%
bigger your number the better got
 
01:36:43.790 --> 01:36:43.800 align:start position:0%
it yeah and then if you don't have a
 
01:36:46.629 --> 01:36:46.639 align:start position:0%
number I don't know what that means
 
01:36:48.950 --> 01:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
but but these are our classified
 
01:36:51.270 --> 01:36:51.280 align:start position:0%
positions here actually the director
 
01:36:54.109 --> 01:36:54.119 align:start position:0%
here is an administrator for so that
 
01:36:57.109 --> 01:36:57.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:01.109 --> 01:37:01.119 align:start position:0%
question uh moving on to some benchmarks
 
01:37:01.119 --> 01:37:02.709 align:start position:0%
question uh moving on to some benchmarks
um

01:37:02.709 --> 01:37:02.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:06.470 --> 01:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
so in person 92 new hires in January and
 
01:37:09.109 --> 01:37:09.119 align:start position:0%
February so that was before covid hit
 
01:37:12.350 --> 01:37:12.360 align:start position:0%
and then after covid we had 394 new
 
01:37:14.790 --> 01:37:14.800 align:start position:0%
hires that came through that we had to
 
01:37:17.430 --> 01:37:17.440 align:start position:0%
find another way to do that
 
01:37:19.950 --> 01:37:19.960 align:start position:0%
orientation um and I have helped assist
 
01:37:22.189 --> 01:37:22.199 align:start position:0%
with some of those orientations uh via a
 
01:37:24.709 --> 01:37:24.719 align:start position:0%
zoom platform in terms of wel welcoming
 
01:37:26.350 --> 01:37:26.360 align:start position:0%
people to the department and connecting
 
01:37:27.870 --> 01:37:27.880 align:start position:0%
them some to something larger that
 
01:37:31.229 --> 01:37:31.239 align:start position:0%
they're not uh in person uh at so that
 
01:37:32.550 --> 01:37:32.560 align:start position:0%
that has been a challenge but I think
 
01:37:34.990 --> 01:37:35.000 align:start position:0%
we've done a pretty good job with it as
 
01:37:36.470 --> 01:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
I mentioned we had the 12,000
 
01:37:38.590 --> 01:37:38.600 align:start position:0%
applications now some of you may cringe
 
01:37:40.709 --> 01:37:40.719 align:start position:0%
when you see this next one average 55
 
01:37:42.709 --> 01:37:42.719 align:start position:0%
days to fill the position from posting
 
01:37:44.990 --> 01:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
to hire right wow that's terrible how
 
01:37:47.149 --> 01:37:47.159 align:start position:0%
can it take 55 days to hire somebody
 
01:37:49.070 --> 01:37:49.080 align:start position:0%
well when you compare it to it was about
 
01:37:52.910 --> 01:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
90 days before so there's Improvement um
 
01:37:55.189 --> 01:37:55.199 align:start position:0%
that 50 5 days is often some of the
 
01:37:57.070 --> 01:37:57.080 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy that goes with trying to
 
01:37:59.149 --> 01:37:59.159 align:start position:0%
hire in state government in terms of
 
01:38:00.990 --> 01:38:01.000 align:start position:0%
paperwork Shuffle and and different
 
01:38:03.270 --> 01:38:03.280 align:start position:0%
components so we're constantly trying to
 
01:38:05.270 --> 01:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
use a lean process to get that number
 
01:38:07.790 --> 01:38:07.800 align:start position:0%
down and to get people on board quicker
 
01:38:09.270 --> 01:38:09.280 align:start position:0%
um and we're not alone you'll find that
 
01:38:13.629 --> 01:38:13.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:17.589 --> 01:38:17.599 align:start position:0%
Challenge and we trained 1,120 employees
 
01:38:20.790 --> 01:38:20.800 align:start position:0%
um for last year in Co most of that was
 
01:38:24.390 --> 01:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
virtual uh virtual training
 
01:38:26.990 --> 01:38:27.000 align:start position:0%
which folks actually showed up for
 
01:38:29.990 --> 01:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
because there was there was this uh
 
01:38:31.510 --> 01:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
element of people wanting to stay
 
01:38:33.109 --> 01:38:33.119 align:start position:0%
connected we want to stay connected with
 
01:38:34.790 --> 01:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
our co-workers we want to stay connected
 
01:38:36.070 --> 01:38:36.080 align:start position:0%
with our office we want to stay
 
01:38:38.510 --> 01:38:38.520 align:start position:0%
connected with those that we serve um so
 
01:38:40.589 --> 01:38:40.599 align:start position:0%
we saw people making a real effort to
 
01:38:42.070 --> 01:38:42.080 align:start position:0%
make stay
 
01:38:44.149 --> 01:38:44.159 align:start position:0%
connected um when we look at what would
 
01:38:46.790 --> 01:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
we do if we had 5% more 5% less
 
01:38:50.070 --> 01:38:50.080 align:start position:0%
obviously we would do more of uh
 
01:38:51.669 --> 01:38:51.679 align:start position:0%
training and development we have some
 
01:38:53.109 --> 01:38:53.119 align:start position:0%
initiatives that we would you know
 
01:38:55.109 --> 01:38:55.119 align:start position:0%
consider consider launching but I think
 
01:38:56.550 --> 01:38:56.560 align:start position:0%
going back to the theme you're going to
 
01:38:58.950 --> 01:38:58.960 align:start position:0%
see a theme here when we talk about um
 
01:39:00.750 --> 01:39:00.760 align:start position:0%
Information Services not only the
 
01:39:03.030 --> 01:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
software systems but also the hardware
 
01:39:05.790 --> 01:39:05.800 align:start position:0%
we're lacking in this area as well um we
 
01:39:08.310 --> 01:39:08.320 align:start position:0%
don't have we have to rely
 
01:39:11.950 --> 01:39:11.960 align:start position:0%
on uh the state system which is okay but
 
01:39:13.589 --> 01:39:13.599 align:start position:0%
it doesn't meet all of our needs when
 
01:39:16.109 --> 01:39:16.119 align:start position:0%
we're talking about HR metrics and so we
 
01:39:18.669 --> 01:39:18.679 align:start position:0%
have to do some of our own calculating
 
01:39:21.430 --> 01:39:21.440 align:start position:0%
of those metrics which um you know we
 
01:39:23.430 --> 01:39:23.440 align:start position:0%
would be great if we had a database uh
 
01:39:26.270 --> 01:39:26.280 align:start position:0%
software to be able to help us do that
 
01:39:29.790 --> 01:39:29.800 align:start position:0%
and if we didn't have the 5% obviously
 
01:39:31.149 --> 01:39:31.159 align:start position:0%
we'd have to look at a reduction in
 
01:39:32.830 --> 01:39:32.840 align:start position:0%
force and less training and less
 
01:39:35.790 --> 01:39:35.800 align:start position:0%
Services um and and delayed response on
 
01:39:37.030 --> 01:39:37.040 align:start position:0%
some other things because we wouldn't
 
01:39:38.950 --> 01:39:38.960 align:start position:0%
have a lot of staff I want to always
 
01:39:41.149 --> 01:39:41.159 align:start position:0%
stay in the 5% more I get really worried
 
01:39:43.430 --> 01:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
about the 5 per less but
 
01:39:46.990 --> 01:39:47.000 align:start position:0%
um let's hope it doesn't happen we have
 
01:39:49.390 --> 01:39:49.400 align:start position:0%
about 30 positions so if you think about
 
01:39:51.390 --> 01:39:51.400 align:start position:0%
that picture of the state and I had all
 
01:39:53.390 --> 01:39:53.400 align:start position:0%
of the areas where all staff are so
 
01:39:55.550 --> 01:39:55.560 align:start position:0%
we've got a infrastructure support of
 
01:39:57.910 --> 01:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
about 30 HR staff and various components
 
01:40:01.750 --> 01:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:03.950 --> 01:40:03.960 align:start position:0%
Workforce I have a question on that
 
01:40:06.830 --> 01:40:06.840 align:start position:0%
slide the one you just showed do you do
 
01:40:09.350 --> 01:40:09.360 align:start position:0%
you know if there's um a national
 
01:40:13.109 --> 01:40:13.119 align:start position:0%
Benchmark for for how many HR staff
 
01:40:15.990 --> 01:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
there is needed for like every 100
 
01:40:18.750 --> 01:40:18.760 align:start position:0%
employees are are you are you comparing
 
01:40:20.669 --> 01:40:20.679 align:start position:0%
this to a benchmark or is this just sort
 
01:40:23.030 --> 01:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
of what we we've thought we've needed
 
01:40:24.350 --> 01:40:24.360 align:start position:0%
over over
 
01:40:26.510 --> 01:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
time I'm gonna I'm going to do two
 
01:40:28.910 --> 01:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
things I'm going to tell you what I know
 
01:40:31.109 --> 01:40:31.119 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to ask Stacy to unmute and
 
01:40:32.390 --> 01:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
ask her if she knows if there's a
 
01:40:34.910 --> 01:40:34.920 align:start position:0%
natural Benchmark I can tell you that in
 
01:40:37.390 --> 01:40:37.400 align:start position:0%
the 24 years that I've been here this
 
01:40:39.629 --> 01:40:39.639 align:start position:0%
number has been between 30 and
 
01:40:44.109 --> 01:40:44.119 align:start position:0%
35 um I haven't seen it I go above that
 
01:40:47.270 --> 01:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
I have seen it dip below 28 in times of
 
01:40:49.390 --> 01:40:49.400 align:start position:0%
reductions but Stacy I don't I don't
 
01:40:53.390 --> 01:40:53.400 align:start position:0%
know if there's a ratio for Workforce uh
 
01:40:57.470 --> 01:40:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:00.510 --> 01:41:00.520 align:start position:0%
staff Kevin can she unmute herself or I
 
01:41:03.910 --> 01:41:03.920 align:start position:0%
can okay thank you um thank you for the
 
01:41:05.990 --> 01:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
question in the past we've always used
 
01:41:08.589 --> 01:41:08.599 align:start position:0%
The Benchmark one HR professional for
 
01:41:10.270 --> 01:41:10.280 align:start position:0%
every 100
 
01:41:12.910 --> 01:41:12.920 align:start position:0%
employees um that has slightly shifted
 
01:41:14.550 --> 01:41:14.560 align:start position:0%
over the years partly because we are
 
01:41:16.709 --> 01:41:16.719 align:start position:0%
moving to a telework environment but
 
01:41:18.589 --> 01:41:18.599 align:start position:0%
that has been The Benchmark previously
 
01:41:20.510 --> 01:41:20.520 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to do some additional research
 
01:41:24.910 --> 01:41:24.920 align:start position:0%
if you'd like to get an updated number
 
01:41:26.430 --> 01:41:26.440 align:start position:0%
I I'd say you're going to have a lot of
 
01:41:28.990 --> 01:41:29.000 align:start position:0%
places to put your energy I just I just
 
01:41:31.270 --> 01:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
would I just like hearing that you all
 
01:41:33.550 --> 01:41:33.560 align:start position:0%
are looking at external benchmarks and
 
01:41:36.709 --> 01:41:36.719 align:start position:0%
and comparing yourself so that we we we
 
01:41:40.669 --> 01:41:40.679 align:start position:0%
are rationally growing or or reducing so
 
01:41:40.679 --> 01:41:42.189 align:start position:0%
are rationally growing or or reducing so
thank

01:41:42.189 --> 01:41:42.199 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:41:46.629 --> 01:41:46.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:49.709 --> 01:41:49.719 align:start position:0%
Stacey I have no green in my budget
 
01:41:52.950 --> 01:41:52.960 align:start position:0%
comparison I only have red and blue we
 
01:41:55.470 --> 01:41:55.480 align:start position:0%
have General funds and we have very uh
 
01:41:58.470 --> 01:41:58.480 align:start position:0%
little federal funds HR is PR primarily
 
01:42:02.950 --> 01:42:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:05.149 --> 01:42:05.159 align:start position:0%
funded and I think
 
01:42:08.189 --> 01:42:08.199 align:start position:0%
that my accounting
 
01:42:11.149 --> 01:42:11.159 align:start position:0%
unit so these would be the corresponding
 
01:42:13.189 --> 01:42:13.199 align:start position:0%
numbers for the for the budget book and
 
01:42:16.149 --> 01:42:16.159 align:start position:0%
for the briefing page and that that
 
01:42:18.830 --> 01:42:18.840 align:start position:0%
wraps up the high level of Human
 
01:42:21.109 --> 01:42:21.119 align:start position:0%
Resources if there are no questions I
 
01:42:25.510 --> 01:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:28.109 --> 01:42:28.119 align:start position:0%
I don't see any questions any anyone on
 
01:42:31.270 --> 01:42:31.280 align:start position:0%
the committee have a question here all
 
01:42:34.910 --> 01:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
right I'm not seeing any so go
 
01:42:37.910 --> 01:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
forth great thank you uh so our next
 
01:42:39.629 --> 01:42:39.639 align:start position:0%
program is from the office of the
 
01:42:41.470 --> 01:42:41.480 align:start position:0%
Commissioners the employee assistance
 
01:42:44.430 --> 01:42:44.440 align:start position:0%
program um this program basically was
 
01:42:47.510 --> 01:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
born and grew up in the department of
 
01:42:49.030 --> 01:42:49.040 align:start position:0%
health health and human services and I
 
01:42:51.149 --> 01:42:51.159 align:start position:0%
am proud to say that we have Paula NATO
 
01:42:53.310 --> 01:42:53.320 align:start position:0%
Booth as our director for the last she
 
01:42:56.070 --> 01:42:56.080 align:start position:0%
just celebrated her
 
01:43:00.510 --> 01:43:00.520 align:start position:0%
31 years Paul 35 okay right it was 31 35
 
01:43:02.629 --> 01:43:02.639 align:start position:0%
years with the Department 35 years that
 
01:43:05.310 --> 01:43:05.320 align:start position:0%
is wonderful so Paula has taken the
 
01:43:07.189 --> 01:43:07.199 align:start position:0%
program from infy all the way up to
 
01:43:10.270 --> 01:43:10.280 align:start position:0%
where it is today uh it serves the thing
 
01:43:14.070 --> 01:43:14.080 align:start position:0%
about HHS um e sorry excuse me EAP is
 
01:43:16.149 --> 01:43:16.159 align:start position:0%
that it actually sits in Health and
 
01:43:19.109 --> 01:43:19.119 align:start position:0%
Human Services but it Services all of
 
01:43:21.510 --> 01:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
the state agencies IT services the
 
01:43:23.950 --> 01:43:23.960 align:start position:0%
judicial branch the governor office and
 
01:43:26.589 --> 01:43:26.599 align:start position:0%
in some case um in the courts and in
 
01:43:29.070 --> 01:43:29.080 align:start position:0%
some cases municipalities so we're
 
01:43:31.430 --> 01:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
talking about a program that spans
 
01:43:34.950 --> 01:43:34.960 align:start position:0%
pretty far and wide has a staff of
 
01:43:40.229 --> 01:43:40.239 align:start position:0%
six so the this group would does EAP
 
01:43:43.070 --> 01:43:43.080 align:start position:0%
traditionally um provides Counseling
 
01:43:44.830 --> 01:43:44.840 align:start position:0%
Services sometimes short-term counseling
 
01:43:46.709 --> 01:43:46.719 align:start position:0%
services for our staff right for our
 
01:43:49.510 --> 01:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
employees um we often have unfortunately
 
01:43:51.510 --> 01:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
have tragedies that occur you may
 
01:43:53.830 --> 01:43:53.840 align:start position:0%
remember the motorcycle AC that happened
 
01:43:55.270 --> 01:43:55.280 align:start position:0%
up in the North Country a couple of
 
01:43:57.750 --> 01:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
years ago a lot of folks getting called
 
01:44:00.070 --> 01:44:00.080 align:start position:0%
to that EAP was also called to that to
 
01:44:02.510 --> 01:44:02.520 align:start position:0%
assist if there's an employee death in
 
01:44:03.870 --> 01:44:03.880 align:start position:0%
the workplace and
 
01:44:05.910 --> 01:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
unfortunately uh that does happen and
 
01:44:07.669 --> 01:44:07.679 align:start position:0%
there have been quite a few in HHS over
 
01:44:09.589 --> 01:44:09.599 align:start position:0%
the last couple of years Paula and her
 
01:44:12.910 --> 01:44:12.920 align:start position:0%
team will come in and uh support the
 
01:44:15.629 --> 01:44:15.639 align:start position:0%
team with grief counseling um there are
 
01:44:17.950 --> 01:44:17.960 align:start position:0%
all kinds of issues that happen in the
 
01:44:21.550 --> 01:44:21.560 align:start position:0%
workplace EAP will come in uh be able to
 
01:44:24.070 --> 01:44:24.080 align:start position:0%
provide some short-term uh me meet some
 
01:44:26.830 --> 01:44:26.840 align:start position:0%
needs and if it is required for more
 
01:44:28.629 --> 01:44:28.639 align:start position:0%
they can refer out for a behavioral
 
01:44:31.990 --> 01:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
health um referral as well so
 
01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:33.470 align:start position:0%
health um referral as well so
well-utilized

01:44:33.470 --> 01:44:33.480 align:start position:0%
well-utilized
 
01:44:37.229 --> 01:44:37.239 align:start position:0%
program um these are the I got a little
 
01:44:38.629 --> 01:44:38.639 align:start position:0%
bit ahead of myself this these are the
 
01:44:40.430 --> 01:44:40.440 align:start position:0%
various components of it which is the
 
01:44:42.270 --> 01:44:42.280 align:start position:0%
individual own counseling The Crisis
 
01:44:43.629 --> 01:44:43.639 align:start position:0%
Intervention which is what I was
 
01:44:45.910 --> 01:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
mentioning and they also do supervisory
 
01:44:48.870 --> 01:44:48.880 align:start position:0%
and management consulting so often Paula
 
01:44:51.149 --> 01:44:51.159 align:start position:0%
will be called in to work with various
 
01:44:54.070 --> 01:44:54.080 align:start position:0%
leadership teams leaders and often times
 
01:44:55.990 --> 01:44:56.000 align:start position:0%
Commissioners as well it's a resource
 
01:44:59.790 --> 01:44:59.800 align:start position:0%
available to anyone in state government
 
01:45:02.990 --> 01:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
that is uh part of the system it's a
 
01:45:05.350 --> 01:45:05.360 align:start position:0%
cost allocated system so every agency
 
01:45:07.430 --> 01:45:07.440 align:start position:0%
pays in a proportion based on their
 
01:45:13.310 --> 01:45:13.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:16.070 --> 01:45:16.080 align:start position:0%
services um over the last year they've
 
01:45:18.270 --> 01:45:18.280 align:start position:0%
been very busy as you can man imagine
 
01:45:20.109 --> 01:45:20.119 align:start position:0%
with covid in terms of providing
 
01:45:22.629 --> 01:45:22.639 align:start position:0%
training and providing support uh the
 
01:45:26.189 --> 01:45:26.199 align:start position:0%
Govern recently launched back in January
 
01:45:28.750 --> 01:45:28.760 align:start position:0%
January of 2021 the respect and
 
01:45:31.830 --> 01:45:31.840 align:start position:0%
stability in the workplace uh EAP was at
 
01:45:33.669 --> 01:45:33.679 align:start position:0%
the table from its Inception that was
 
01:45:36.390 --> 01:45:36.400 align:start position:0%
about a two-year project um it was
 
01:45:38.310 --> 01:45:38.320 align:start position:0%
really uh beefing up the existing
 
01:45:40.430 --> 01:45:40.440 align:start position:0%
program that we already had but Paulo's
 
01:45:43.470 --> 01:45:43.480 align:start position:0%
team was a big part of that um and also
 
01:45:45.390 --> 01:45:45.400 align:start position:0%
one of the neat accomplishments I think
 
01:45:47.790 --> 01:45:47.800 align:start position:0%
that's on here is this last bullet is to
 
01:45:50.589 --> 01:45:50.599 align:start position:0%
provide some peer support programs uh po
 
01:45:53.270 --> 01:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
team is involved with not only HH just
 
01:45:55.310 --> 01:45:55.320 align:start position:0%
but Department of Safety um for some
 
01:45:57.070 --> 01:45:57.080 align:start position:0%
peer support groups and some things that
 
01:45:58.870 --> 01:45:58.880 align:start position:0%
happen there to be able to have a
 
01:46:01.629 --> 01:46:01.639 align:start position:0%
facilitator and work with uh the group
 
01:46:04.149 --> 01:46:04.159 align:start position:0%
as well as a DCF we know that our case
 
01:46:07.270 --> 01:46:07.280 align:start position:0%
workers face a lot of trauma uh see a
 
01:46:09.229 --> 01:46:09.239 align:start position:0%
lot of trauma every day and there's an
 
01:46:11.470 --> 01:46:11.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity to also take care of each
 
01:46:12.950 --> 01:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
other through the peer support groups
 
01:46:16.270 --> 01:46:16.280 align:start position:0%
and their their group helps with that so
 
01:46:19.270 --> 01:46:19.280 align:start position:0%
some neat accomplishments over the year
 
01:46:21.669 --> 01:46:21.679 align:start position:0%
um some challenges okay here it is again
 
01:46:23.629 --> 01:46:23.639 align:start position:0%
lack of a contemporary data collection
 
01:46:25.950 --> 01:46:25.960 align:start position:0%
system right so how do you improve
 
01:46:29.070 --> 01:46:29.080 align:start position:0%
program without uh consistent data
 
01:46:31.430 --> 01:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
telling us where we need to go so paa
 
01:46:33.390 --> 01:46:33.400 align:start position:0%
and her team have some systems but
 
01:46:35.030 --> 01:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
they're not where they need to be so we
 
01:46:37.390 --> 01:46:37.400 align:start position:0%
are looking to try to be able to have
 
01:46:39.510 --> 01:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
one platform um something like
 
01:46:41.990 --> 01:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
Salesforce to be able to ex use an
 
01:46:43.390 --> 01:46:43.400 align:start position:0%
existing platform where we could get
 
01:46:45.470 --> 01:46:45.480 align:start position:0%
some data that would help uh Drive
 
01:46:47.390 --> 01:46:47.400 align:start position:0%
future programming but that is a
 
01:46:50.229 --> 01:46:50.239 align:start position:0%
challenge currently um Second Challenge
 
01:46:52.470 --> 01:46:52.480 align:start position:0%
is just the lack of uh resources over
 
01:46:54.189 --> 01:46:54.199 align:start position:0%
the time of covid you've probably been
 
01:46:56.470 --> 01:46:56.480 align:start position:0%
reading in the papers that there are uh
 
01:46:58.310 --> 01:46:58.320 align:start position:0%
counselors are booked solid they don't
 
01:47:01.189 --> 01:47:01.199 align:start position:0%
have openings for months um so if PA's
 
01:47:03.030 --> 01:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
team is going to hand off a referral
 
01:47:04.550 --> 01:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's hard to find a behavioral
 
01:47:07.350 --> 01:47:07.360 align:start position:0%
health provider to take that on and I
 
01:47:09.229 --> 01:47:09.239 align:start position:0%
think providing services to a remote
 
01:47:10.750 --> 01:47:10.760 align:start position:0%
Workforce was definitely a challenge
 
01:47:12.430 --> 01:47:12.440 align:start position:0%
over this last year of staff that needed
 
01:47:14.709 --> 01:47:14.719 align:start position:0%
the support but maybe could only do it
 
01:47:17.990 --> 01:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
in in a like a tella Health capacity um
 
01:47:21.070 --> 01:47:21.080 align:start position:0%
which is is not the same as being in
 
01:47:24.830 --> 01:47:24.840 align:start position:0%
person yes represent
 
01:47:28.070 --> 01:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
I just want to do a time check here um
 
01:47:31.109 --> 01:47:31.119 align:start position:0%
We've Got U a lot of great slides ahead
 
01:47:34.669 --> 01:47:34.679 align:start position:0%
of us uh do you have a projected time if
 
01:47:36.629 --> 01:47:36.639 align:start position:0%
we don't interrupt you how long this
 
01:47:36.639 --> 01:47:37.470 align:start position:0%
we don't interrupt you how long this
might

01:47:37.470 --> 01:47:37.480 align:start position:0%
might
 
01:47:43.310 --> 01:47:43.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:47.270 --> 01:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
talk well I could probably get through
 
01:47:49.390 --> 01:47:49.400 align:start position:0%
this uh through facilities and the next
 
01:47:51.310 --> 01:47:51.320 align:start position:0%
15 minutes turn it over to Ann Landry
 
01:47:52.990 --> 01:47:53.000 align:start position:0%
for the last piece maybe be done in the
 
01:47:55.990 --> 01:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
next half an hour does that work okay I
 
01:47:57.990 --> 01:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
would I would like to Target being done
 
01:47:59.910 --> 01:47:59.920 align:start position:0%
by noon so that we can take a break at
 
01:48:08.830 --> 01:48:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:11.310 --> 01:48:11.320 align:start position:0%
you here we have the team I think what
 
01:48:13.510 --> 01:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
I'll point out for time purposes here is
 
01:48:16.310 --> 01:48:16.320 align:start position:0%
that we have a a lot of longevity from
 
01:48:18.589 --> 01:48:18.599 align:start position:0%
our councellors in Paula and her team as
 
01:48:21.430 --> 01:48:21.440 align:start position:0%
I mentioned Paula's been here uh for
 
01:48:23.589 --> 01:48:23.599 align:start position:0%
State service of 35 years so we have a
 
01:48:28.550 --> 01:48:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:31.070 --> 01:48:31.080 align:start position:0%
potin um some benchmarks that they were
 
01:48:34.589 --> 01:48:34.599 align:start position:0%
working on in terms of uh time in covid
 
01:48:36.589 --> 01:48:36.599 align:start position:0%
I think i' I've I've spoken to a lot of
 
01:48:38.870 --> 01:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
these in terms of how do you effectively
 
01:48:40.990 --> 01:48:41.000 align:start position:0%
communicate in in a telephonic kind of
 
01:48:42.910 --> 01:48:42.920 align:start position:0%
not telephonic but a telework kind of
 
01:48:46.229 --> 01:48:46.239 align:start position:0%
World um providing interventions uh and
 
01:48:47.990 --> 01:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
and working with employees that are
 
01:48:49.709 --> 01:48:49.719 align:start position:0%
currently in the workplace or having
 
01:48:53.189 --> 01:48:53.199 align:start position:0%
issues um and the clear uh clinical peer
 
01:48:55.390 --> 01:48:55.400 align:start position:0%
support that I've
 
01:48:57.950 --> 01:48:57.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned so if we're looking at our
 
01:49:00.589 --> 01:49:00.599 align:start position:0%
budget in terms of what where we looking
 
01:49:02.430 --> 01:49:02.440 align:start position:0%
at we could always use more staff to
 
01:49:04.589 --> 01:49:04.599 align:start position:0%
help the need is always there uh the
 
01:49:06.350 --> 01:49:06.360 align:start position:0%
data management system is something we
 
01:49:08.510 --> 01:49:08.520 align:start position:0%
would like to proc procure when we're
 
01:49:10.470 --> 01:49:10.480 align:start position:0%
trying to do that now even without the
 
01:49:12.830 --> 01:49:12.840 align:start position:0%
5% increase just to try to find a way to
 
01:49:15.750 --> 01:49:15.760 align:start position:0%
to fix that system and then obviously
 
01:49:17.870 --> 01:49:17.880 align:start position:0%
there would impact on decreased Services
 
01:49:19.870 --> 01:49:19.880 align:start position:0%
if we had to make some
 
01:49:23.750 --> 01:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
Cuts so we have six uh full-time staff
 
01:49:26.830 --> 01:49:26.840 align:start position:0%
for all of the services that I mentioned
 
01:49:29.550 --> 01:49:29.560 align:start position:0%
um and pretty much they are primarily uh
 
01:49:31.830 --> 01:49:31.840 align:start position:0%
generally funded as well although there
 
01:49:35.669 --> 01:49:35.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:40.189 --> 01:49:40.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:44.550 --> 01:49:44.560 align:start position:0%
then Karen there's no briefing book page
 
01:49:47.669 --> 01:49:47.679 align:start position:0%
number on this slide so we'll have to
 
01:49:49.270 --> 01:49:49.280 align:start position:0%
get that updated for
 
01:49:54.030 --> 01:49:54.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:56.750 --> 01:49:56.760 align:start position:0%
so that concludes EAP if there aren any
 
01:49:59.589 --> 01:49:59.599 align:start position:0%
questions I'll go on to
 
01:50:02.910 --> 01:50:02.920 align:start position:0%
facilities I I had a question I it looks
 
01:50:05.109 --> 01:50:05.119 align:start position:0%
like overall we're probably spending
 
01:50:09.270 --> 01:50:09.280 align:start position:0%
about $75 per state employee on an EAP
 
01:50:12.109 --> 01:50:12.119 align:start position:0%
is is if if my math is right do we have
 
01:50:14.550 --> 01:50:14.560 align:start position:0%
a a benchmark for EAP to compare
 
01:50:18.229 --> 01:50:18.239 align:start position:0%
ourselves to so we don't NE the way that
 
01:50:20.629 --> 01:50:20.639 align:start position:0%
we do the cost structure for uh the
 
01:50:23.750 --> 01:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
funding is actually it's a lot less than
 
01:50:26.350 --> 01:50:26.360 align:start position:0%
that per person uh it's based on uh
 
01:50:28.149 --> 01:50:28.159 align:start position:0%
number of full-time and part-time staff
 
01:50:31.229 --> 01:50:31.239 align:start position:0%
that an agency has um as formula for it
 
01:50:33.870 --> 01:50:33.880 align:start position:0%
I think we were down um Paula and Mary
 
01:50:35.390 --> 01:50:35.400 align:start position:0%
kis is on the line correct me if I'm
 
01:50:37.550 --> 01:50:37.560 align:start position:0%
wrong but I think we were between 25 and
 
01:50:40.510 --> 01:50:40.520 align:start position:0%
$35 per
 
01:50:40.520 --> 01:50:44.149 align:start position:0%
$35 per
person

01:50:44.149 --> 01:50:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:47.350 --> 01:50:47.360 align:start position:0%
yes we offer because we offer that as
 
01:50:49.830 --> 01:50:49.840 align:start position:0%
the state service representative I I
 
01:50:51.470 --> 01:50:51.480 align:start position:0%
don't you know in terms of the
 
01:50:53.430 --> 01:50:53.440 align:start position:0%
comparisons a lot of of other states
 
01:50:56.550 --> 01:50:56.560 align:start position:0%
Outsource their AAP with a vendor that's
 
01:50:58.270 --> 01:50:58.280 align:start position:0%
not necessarily in state so I think one
 
01:51:00.229 --> 01:51:00.239 align:start position:0%
of the reasons why we can do it for Less
 
01:51:04.069 --> 01:51:04.079 align:start position:0%
is because we offer it as a state
 
01:51:08.390 --> 01:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
service may I make one comment please um
 
01:51:10.750 --> 01:51:10.760 align:start position:0%
the other part of it too is because
 
01:51:12.830 --> 01:51:12.840 align:start position:0%
they're within this closed system so to
 
01:51:15.229 --> 01:51:15.239 align:start position:0%
speak we've been able to expand the
 
01:51:18.229 --> 01:51:18.239 align:start position:0%
services that this program offers to all
 
01:51:20.510 --> 01:51:20.520 align:start position:0%
three branches of government and so when
 
01:51:23.990 --> 01:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
you want to compare Apple to Apples very
 
01:51:26.589 --> 01:51:26.599 align:start position:0%
often an EAP program outside of the
 
01:51:29.310 --> 01:51:29.320 align:start position:0%
state system would be a 1 1800 number
 
01:51:31.229 --> 01:51:31.239 align:start position:0%
where somebody might call and get some
 
01:51:34.430 --> 01:51:34.440 align:start position:0%
suggestions we are a Hands-On onsite
 
01:51:37.030 --> 01:51:37.040 align:start position:0%
program that really has been able to
 
01:51:40.189 --> 01:51:40.199 align:start position:0%
morph based on the culture within which
 
01:51:43.109 --> 01:51:43.119 align:start position:0%
we go into so what we do at the prison
 
01:51:45.189 --> 01:51:45.199 align:start position:0%
in Berlin is different than we would do
 
01:51:47.030 --> 01:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
for the general court which is different
 
01:51:49.550 --> 01:51:49.560 align:start position:0%
than what we would do for dcyf or State
 
01:51:51.910 --> 01:51:51.920 align:start position:0%
Police so we've had the Good Fortune
 
01:51:53.310 --> 01:51:53.320 align:start position:0%
because of the support of all the
 
01:51:55.589 --> 01:51:55.599 align:start position:0%
agencies to really make this a model
 
01:52:01.390 --> 01:52:01.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:03.830 --> 01:52:03.840 align:start position:0%
well thanks
 
01:52:06.470 --> 01:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
Paula any other questions before we wrap
 
01:52:06.480 --> 01:52:11.229 align:start position:0%
Paula any other questions before we wrap
up

01:52:11.229 --> 01:52:11.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:14.629 --> 01:52:14.639 align:start position:0%
EAP okay let's move on to facilities
 
01:52:18.229 --> 01:52:18.239 align:start position:0%
we're on 36 of 61 we're halfway halfway
 
01:52:23.390 --> 01:52:23.400 align:start position:0%
there uh we have a uh a bureau here a a
 
01:52:27.430 --> 01:52:27.440 align:start position:0%
facilities uh management that is put
 
01:52:29.390 --> 01:52:29.400 align:start position:0%
together with our office services so
 
01:52:32.189 --> 01:52:32.199 align:start position:0%
some of our uh inventory and purchasing
 
01:52:36.069 --> 01:52:36.079 align:start position:0%
uh unit um basically this group for all
 
01:52:38.629 --> 01:52:38.639 align:start position:0%
of those properties that I shared in the
 
01:52:41.069 --> 01:52:41.079 align:start position:0%
slide is responsible for most of the
 
01:52:43.109 --> 01:52:43.119 align:start position:0%
maintenance in that group our district
 
01:52:45.069 --> 01:52:45.079 align:start position:0%
offices the landlords are responsible
 
01:52:46.830 --> 01:52:46.840 align:start position:0%
for a lot of that maintenance but for
 
01:52:50.310 --> 01:52:50.320 align:start position:0%
the Sops campus the Hazen campus and our
 
01:52:53.510 --> 01:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
institutions um excuse me facility
 
01:52:55.750 --> 01:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
oversees that which comes up to about 25
 
01:52:57.830 --> 01:52:57.840 align:start position:0%
lease spaces about
 
01:53:02.470 --> 01:53:02.480 align:start position:0%
2,225 560 Square ft of office space um
 
01:53:05.550 --> 01:53:05.560 align:start position:0%
for approximately 1,100 staff of how
 
01:53:08.830 --> 01:53:08.840 align:start position:0%
that breaks out so it's it's quite a bit
 
01:53:12.030 --> 01:53:12.040 align:start position:0%
uh of property to oversee we have
 
01:53:14.109 --> 01:53:14.119 align:start position:0%
obviously we have our facilities and
 
01:53:15.990 --> 01:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
maintenance that I mentioned senu
 
01:53:18.589 --> 01:53:18.599 align:start position:0%
service centers is about 150 acres with
 
01:53:21.910 --> 01:53:21.920 align:start position:0%
13 buildings uh Glen Cliff is 70 Acres
 
01:53:25.790 --> 01:53:25.800 align:start position:0%
with 2 buildings um and also who am I
 
01:53:27.589 --> 01:53:27.599 align:start position:0%
missing New Hampshire hospital is right
 
01:53:30.629 --> 01:53:30.639 align:start position:0%
here on campus um with one building but
 
01:53:33.830 --> 01:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
with many needs um so our facilities
 
01:53:35.229 --> 01:53:35.239 align:start position:0%
folks are out there working on a
 
01:53:37.550 --> 01:53:37.560 align:start position:0%
multitude of facility issues as well as
 
01:53:39.550 --> 01:53:39.560 align:start position:0%
designing new space you've often heard
 
01:53:41.669 --> 01:53:41.679 align:start position:0%
about different initiatives of building
 
01:53:44.270 --> 01:53:44.280 align:start position:0%
things um our facilities unit will work
 
01:53:46.870 --> 01:53:46.880 align:start position:0%
on uh being a part of that team we also
 
01:53:48.550 --> 01:53:48.560 align:start position:0%
have what we call facility coordinators
 
01:53:50.629 --> 01:53:50.639 align:start position:0%
who are in these regions of the state
 
01:53:52.910 --> 01:53:52.920 align:start position:0%
who are our logistical and fac facility
 
01:53:57.069 --> 01:53:57.079 align:start position:0%
support of a link back to any um needs
 
01:54:00.069 --> 01:54:00.079 align:start position:0%
that they may have so we have we have 11
 
01:54:02.990 --> 01:54:03.000 align:start position:0%
district offices we have 3.5 facility
 
01:54:04.510 --> 01:54:04.520 align:start position:0%
coordinators so we don't have enough
 
01:54:06.270 --> 01:54:06.280 align:start position:0%
staff to cover every office they were
 
01:54:08.790 --> 01:54:08.800 align:start position:0%
cut many years ago we have not been able
 
01:54:11.510 --> 01:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
to get positions put back in the budget
 
01:54:13.229 --> 01:54:13.239 align:start position:0%
um since they were cut although there is
 
01:54:15.830 --> 01:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
a need couple of questions there yes who
 
01:54:18.030 --> 01:54:18.040 align:start position:0%
would like to go first representative
 
01:54:19.910 --> 01:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
Earth representative F you're you're
 
01:54:19.920 --> 01:54:23.149 align:start position:0%
Earth representative F you're you're
recognized

01:54:23.149 --> 01:54:23.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:24.109 --> 01:54:24.119 align:start position:0%
so I'm
 
01:54:27.390 --> 01:54:27.400 align:start position:0%
guessing many of your folks are working
 
01:54:30.709 --> 01:54:30.719 align:start position:0%
remote these days and I'm wondering
 
01:54:32.669 --> 01:54:32.679 align:start position:0%
which means a lot of your buildings are
 
01:54:34.750 --> 01:54:34.760 align:start position:0%
empty and I'm wondering if you've
 
01:54:37.030 --> 01:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
considered as I think many other
 
01:54:38.669 --> 01:54:38.679 align:start position:0%
companies have starting to consider
 
01:54:40.870 --> 01:54:40.880 align:start position:0%
staying on that model going forward and
 
01:54:43.310 --> 01:54:43.320 align:start position:0%
starting to reduce your actual physical
 
01:54:44.510 --> 01:54:44.520 align:start position:0%
space and
 
01:54:46.990 --> 01:54:47.000 align:start position:0%
leases yeah so just a couple things on
 
01:54:49.990 --> 01:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
that um we actually do have staff in our
 
01:54:53.950 --> 01:54:53.960 align:start position:0%
buildings our uh we have taken all of
 
01:54:57.109 --> 01:54:57.119 align:start position:0%
our buildings and with the appropriate
 
01:54:59.350 --> 01:54:59.360 align:start position:0%
uh social distancing measurements and
 
01:55:01.470 --> 01:55:01.480 align:start position:0%
seats have determined what our capacity
 
01:55:04.310 --> 01:55:04.320 align:start position:0%
would be so we do not have 100% remote
 
01:55:06.950 --> 01:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
Workforce we probably reduced at least
 
01:55:09.669 --> 01:55:09.679 align:start position:0%
50% um so we do have about half working
 
01:55:12.910 --> 01:55:12.920 align:start position:0%
at home um that said one of the things
 
01:55:15.069 --> 01:55:15.079 align:start position:0%
that we learned is that we could keep
 
01:55:17.030 --> 01:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
some people at home so how do we reduce
 
01:55:18.870 --> 01:55:18.880 align:start position:0%
our brick and mortar so we have
 
01:55:20.669 --> 01:55:20.679 align:start position:0%
long-term leases with the district
 
01:55:23.229 --> 01:55:23.239 align:start position:0%
offices so as as those start to come up
 
01:55:25.109 --> 01:55:25.119 align:start position:0%
for Renewal we're looking at reducing
 
01:55:26.910 --> 01:55:26.920 align:start position:0%
that footprint and finding a smaller
 
01:55:29.910 --> 01:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
space absolutely um but we do I just
 
01:55:31.990 --> 01:55:32.000 align:start position:0%
want to be clear our facilities uh
 
01:55:34.589 --> 01:55:34.599 align:start position:0%
people have not been remote they have
 
01:55:37.709 --> 01:55:37.719 align:start position:0%
been Frontline and center of cleaning uh
 
01:55:39.430 --> 01:55:39.440 align:start position:0%
and having to be if there was any sort
 
01:55:42.229 --> 01:55:42.239 align:start position:0%
of covid exposure or any needs so I I I
 
01:55:43.950 --> 01:55:43.960 align:start position:0%
I just want to share that that um there
 
01:55:45.990 --> 01:55:46.000 align:start position:0%
is a perception that all state employees
 
01:55:48.430 --> 01:55:48.440 align:start position:0%
are remote and and they're they're not
 
01:55:49.910 --> 01:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
and these guys have been our Frontline
 
01:55:52.830 --> 01:55:52.840 align:start position:0%
Heroes go ahead can I follow up sure
 
01:55:54.470 --> 01:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
I I didn't mean specifically the
 
01:55:56.109 --> 01:55:56.119 align:start position:0%
facilities people I met the people in
 
01:55:58.669 --> 01:55:58.679 align:start position:0%
the facilities yes I know I just was my
 
01:56:01.229 --> 01:56:01.239 align:start position:0%
opportunity to share that too I agree
 
01:56:02.830 --> 01:56:02.840 align:start position:0%
but your point well-being yes we are
 
01:56:04.390 --> 01:56:04.400 align:start position:0%
trying to reduce our brick and Mort for
 
01:56:04.400 --> 01:56:06.149 align:start position:0%
trying to reduce our brick and Mort for
sure

01:56:06.149 --> 01:56:06.159 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:56:08.550 --> 01:56:08.560 align:start position:0%
yes representative ever did you have a
 
01:56:10.069 --> 01:56:10.079 align:start position:0%
question or were you just recognizing
 
01:56:12.470 --> 01:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
representative or uh I was just
 
01:56:15.109 --> 01:56:15.119 align:start position:0%
recognizing him okay kind of goes with
 
01:56:15.119 --> 01:56:17.589 align:start position:0%
recognizing him okay kind of goes with
the

01:56:17.589 --> 01:56:17.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:20.109 --> 01:56:20.119 align:start position:0%
territory and uh last thing on here is
 
01:56:22.430 --> 01:56:22.440 align:start position:0%
just office services which is your basic
 
01:56:24.750 --> 01:56:24.760 align:start position:0%
uh Fleet Management Logistics purchasing
 
01:56:26.950 --> 01:56:26.960 align:start position:0%
inventory archiving and mail services so
 
01:56:31.069 --> 01:56:31.079 align:start position:0%
all of those are in our facility
 
01:56:33.350 --> 01:56:33.360 align:start position:0%
area so I was talking about this a
 
01:56:35.790 --> 01:56:35.800 align:start position:0%
little bit we did have a lot happening
 
01:56:38.510 --> 01:56:38.520 align:start position:0%
with covid setting up covid tracking
 
01:56:41.270 --> 01:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
sites vaccination sites uh procurement
 
01:56:43.189 --> 01:56:43.199 align:start position:0%
warehouse space where do we put all this
 
01:56:45.629 --> 01:56:45.639 align:start position:0%
PPE we don't have enough warehouse space
 
01:56:47.069 --> 01:56:47.079 align:start position:0%
facilities with Fronton Center and
 
01:56:50.510 --> 01:56:50.520 align:start position:0%
helping us uh with that as well we uh
 
01:56:52.390 --> 01:56:52.400 align:start position:0%
one of the biggest accomplishments is
 
01:56:54.270 --> 01:56:54.280 align:start position:0%
the path program that's here on State
 
01:56:56.069 --> 01:56:56.079 align:start position:0%
Office Park South uh that is
 
01:56:57.709 --> 01:56:57.719 align:start position:0%
commissioner shanet was referring that
 
01:57:00.790 --> 01:57:00.800 align:start position:0%
to that earlier where we increased our a
 
01:57:02.950 --> 01:57:02.960 align:start position:0%
transitional program for psychiatric
 
01:57:04.350 --> 01:57:04.360 align:start position:0%
adults coming out of New Hampshire
 
01:57:06.030 --> 01:57:06.040 align:start position:0%
hospital being able to have a step down
 
01:57:07.790 --> 01:57:07.800 align:start position:0%
here on campus into the fieldbook
 
01:57:10.310 --> 01:57:10.320 align:start position:0%
building and facilities in about less
 
01:57:12.550 --> 01:57:12.560 align:start position:0%
than four months was able to make that
 
01:57:13.830 --> 01:57:13.840 align:start position:0%
happen they were able to remove the
 
01:57:16.470 --> 01:57:16.480 align:start position:0%
tenant renovate the space ready it for
 
01:57:19.589 --> 01:57:19.599 align:start position:0%
occupany and then get uh uh patients in
 
01:57:22.350 --> 01:57:22.360 align:start position:0%
there so it was a huge accomplishment um
 
01:57:24.390 --> 01:57:24.400 align:start position:0%
emergency repairs to Glen Cliffe and
 
01:57:26.709 --> 01:57:26.719 align:start position:0%
senuna Center who Glen Cliff is pretty
 
01:57:28.629 --> 01:57:28.639 align:start position:0%
self- sustaining um but they do have a
 
01:57:31.830 --> 01:57:31.840 align:start position:0%
lot of needs when things Break um as
 
01:57:33.350 --> 01:57:33.360 align:start position:0%
well as senu
 
01:57:35.990 --> 01:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
Center um we replaced our automatic
 
01:57:38.990 --> 01:57:39.000 align:start position:0%
mailing system which is the big uh was a
 
01:57:40.550 --> 01:57:40.560 align:start position:0%
big deal it took a long time to get the
 
01:57:42.270 --> 01:57:42.280 align:start position:0%
money to be able to replace that system
 
01:57:43.790 --> 01:57:43.800 align:start position:0%
and we finally were able to do that last
 
01:57:46.229 --> 01:57:46.239 align:start position:0%
year as well as the uh fuel delivery
 
01:57:48.390 --> 01:57:48.400 align:start position:0%
system at the transportation garage so
 
01:57:52.350 --> 01:57:52.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:54.589 --> 01:57:54.599 align:start position:0%
similar uh way that we break it down in
 
01:57:57.189 --> 01:57:57.199 align:start position:0%
terms of field the these are our offices
 
01:57:58.870 --> 01:57:58.880 align:start position:0%
as I think you've seen this slide before
 
01:58:00.149 --> 01:58:00.159 align:start position:0%
we have three and a half facility
 
01:58:03.750 --> 01:58:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:06.950 --> 01:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
offices uh some challenges uh uh you're
 
01:58:09.030 --> 01:58:09.040 align:start position:0%
going to hear this probably repeatedly
 
01:58:10.830 --> 01:58:10.840 align:start position:0%
as we go through the budget process is
 
01:58:12.750 --> 01:58:12.760 align:start position:0%
just funding we don't really are not
 
01:58:16.149 --> 01:58:16.159 align:start position:0%
really funded uh I would say 100% ad
 
01:58:18.470 --> 01:58:18.480 align:start position:0%
equally to complete not only the ongoing
 
01:58:20.030 --> 01:58:20.040 align:start position:0%
maintenance projects but also our
 
01:58:22.310 --> 01:58:22.320 align:start position:0%
capital projects maintenance projects as
 
01:58:24.589 --> 01:58:24.599 align:start position:0%
well it's been um there's been a lot of
 
01:58:25.950 --> 01:58:25.960 align:start position:0%
deferred maintenance and we're sort of
 
01:58:27.430 --> 01:58:27.440 align:start position:0%
at a breaking point for some of our
 
01:58:30.390 --> 01:58:30.400 align:start position:0%
buildings um some of our properties um
 
01:58:32.109 --> 01:58:32.119 align:start position:0%
you know it's you know commissioner
 
01:58:34.189 --> 01:58:34.199 align:start position:0%
Arling housee says is it a two bucket
 
01:58:35.870 --> 01:58:35.880 align:start position:0%
leak or an eight bucket leak because if
 
01:58:37.470 --> 01:58:37.480 align:start position:0%
it's a two bucket leak you might be able
 
01:58:39.229 --> 01:58:39.239 align:start position:0%
to wait a little bit longer so we're
 
01:58:42.350 --> 01:58:42.360 align:start position:0%
sort of in that um in that mode and the
 
01:58:44.550 --> 01:58:44.560 align:start position:0%
Staffing is a challenge as well it's
 
01:58:46.310 --> 01:58:46.320 align:start position:0%
been hard to recruit staff to work in
 
01:58:48.910 --> 01:58:48.920 align:start position:0%
the time of Co for for cleaning as well
 
01:58:50.350 --> 01:58:50.360 align:start position:0%
that's been a real
 
01:58:53.990 --> 01:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
challenge so we had have uh our director
 
01:58:56.550 --> 01:58:56.560 align:start position:0%
Dave break in again I'm sorry Miss
 
01:58:59.910 --> 01:58:59.920 align:start position:0%
Weaver representative Earth had a
 
01:59:03.790 --> 01:59:03.800 align:start position:0%
question thank you so I'm guessing that
 
01:59:05.830 --> 01:59:05.840 align:start position:0%
a lot of this is related to covid and
 
01:59:07.709 --> 01:59:07.719 align:start position:0%
therefore perhaps covid funding and I'm
 
01:59:08.870 --> 01:59:08.880 align:start position:0%
wondering first of all is that true and
 
01:59:10.030 --> 01:59:10.040 align:start position:0%
second of all do you have an idea of how
 
01:59:12.510 --> 01:59:12.520 align:start position:0%
much of it was you're able to use Co
 
01:59:14.270 --> 01:59:14.280 align:start position:0%
funding to affect some of these changes
 
01:59:16.229 --> 01:59:16.239 align:start position:0%
which sound like they may benefit us in
 
01:59:17.550 --> 01:59:17.560 align:start position:0%
the Long Haul as
 
01:59:20.390 --> 01:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
well you mean the challenges for from
 
01:59:20.400 --> 01:59:22.229 align:start position:0%
well you mean the challenges for from
covid

01:59:22.229 --> 01:59:22.239 align:start position:0%
covid
 
01:59:23.709 --> 01:59:23.719 align:start position:0%
uh no not specifically the challenges
 
01:59:27.790 --> 01:59:27.800 align:start position:0%
from Co the changes you've made to your
 
01:59:30.229 --> 01:59:30.239 align:start position:0%
processes your facilities basically
 
01:59:32.270 --> 01:59:32.280 align:start position:0%
everything you just been talking about
 
01:59:34.030 --> 01:59:34.040 align:start position:0%
it sounds like some of many of those are
 
01:59:36.669 --> 01:59:36.679 align:start position:0%
covid related changes but at the same
 
01:59:38.350 --> 01:59:38.360 align:start position:0%
time they were efficiency changes going
 
01:59:40.030 --> 01:59:40.040 align:start position:0%
forward they could be efficiency chain
 
01:59:41.550 --> 01:59:41.560 align:start position:0%
going forward and I'm just wondering how
 
01:59:44.430 --> 01:59:44.440 align:start position:0%
much covid money that came in the state
 
01:59:46.750 --> 01:59:46.760 align:start position:0%
was use is there is there way to know
 
01:59:49.310 --> 01:59:49.320 align:start position:0%
how much it was used in that
 
01:59:52.589 --> 01:59:52.599 align:start position:0%
way does that make sense or no
 
01:59:54.350 --> 01:59:54.360 align:start position:0%
um I think I understand but I'm not
 
01:59:56.310 --> 01:59:56.320 align:start position:0%
really I I don't want to answer in case
 
01:59:59.669 --> 01:59:59.679 align:start position:0%
I don't understand your question um so
 
02:00:01.430 --> 02:00:01.440 align:start position:0%
let's take tele medicine I mean it's a
 
02:00:02.709 --> 02:00:02.719 align:start position:0%
bad example but it's something I could
 
02:00:04.830 --> 02:00:04.840 align:start position:0%
sort of speak to so there's an EO for
 
02:00:06.310 --> 02:00:06.320 align:start position:0%
tele medicine which has obviously been a
 
02:00:07.750 --> 02:00:07.760 align:start position:0%
big benefit and the legislature we
 
02:00:09.229 --> 02:00:09.239 align:start position:0%
looking at trying to turn that into a
 
02:00:11.390 --> 02:00:11.400 align:start position:0%
statute so that that benefit can
 
02:00:13.390 --> 02:00:13.400 align:start position:0%
continue going forward that's not
 
02:00:15.470 --> 02:00:15.480 align:start position:0%
related to funding I understand but
 
02:00:17.310 --> 02:00:17.320 align:start position:0%
you've got your department I'm guessing
 
02:00:19.030 --> 02:00:19.040 align:start position:0%
has gotten the line share of all the co
 
02:00:21.069 --> 02:00:21.079 align:start position:0%
funding that's come into the state and
 
02:00:22.430 --> 02:00:22.440 align:start position:0%
it's not just from listening to you talk
 
02:00:24.390 --> 02:00:24.400 align:start position:0%
it sounds like some of the things you've
 
02:00:26.069 --> 02:00:26.079 align:start position:0%
been doing to improve efficiencies and
 
02:00:28.510 --> 02:00:28.520 align:start position:0%
so forth have improved efficiencies but
 
02:00:30.109 --> 02:00:30.119 align:start position:0%
they've also been specific to co because
 
02:00:31.470 --> 02:00:31.480 align:start position:0%
you've had to make these adjustments
 
02:00:33.149 --> 02:00:33.159 align:start position:0%
that are covid related I'm just wonder
 
02:00:35.830 --> 02:00:35.840 align:start position:0%
if you have a sense of
 
02:00:38.390 --> 02:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
how how much of the co funding was
 
02:00:40.310 --> 02:00:40.320 align:start position:0%
applied in that manner to to the benefit
 
02:00:42.830 --> 02:00:42.840 align:start position:0%
of the long term if you will yeah and I
 
02:00:44.790 --> 02:00:44.800 align:start position:0%
you know and it's it's hard to say how
 
02:00:46.629 --> 02:00:46.639 align:start position:0%
much of it was I know it wasn't all of
 
02:00:49.149 --> 02:00:49.159 align:start position:0%
it I mean a lot of the covid went fun
 
02:00:51.270 --> 02:00:51.280 align:start position:0%
funding went to stand up these temporary
 
02:00:53.629 --> 02:00:53.639 align:start position:0%
sites whether for testing or vaccination
 
02:00:55.870 --> 02:00:55.880 align:start position:0%
or or cleaning and then yes there were
 
02:00:58.310 --> 02:00:58.320 align:start position:0%
things that we had to procure like the
 
02:01:00.830 --> 02:01:00.840 align:start position:0%
um equipment to be able to do the Tork
 
02:01:02.750 --> 02:01:02.760 align:start position:0%
right so or the software that goes with
 
02:01:04.790 --> 02:01:04.800 align:start position:0%
that so that that went to it and the the
 
02:01:06.669 --> 02:01:06.679 align:start position:0%
idea would be to sustain that long term
 
02:01:08.510 --> 02:01:08.520 align:start position:0%
right that becomes a new business model
 
02:01:11.470 --> 02:01:11.480 align:start position:0%
for us to use that's what you're talking
 
02:01:14.589 --> 02:01:14.599 align:start position:0%
about yes yeah so I would I would say
 
02:01:17.430 --> 02:01:17.440 align:start position:0%
you know maybe 50% or a little bit less
 
02:01:21.310 --> 02:01:21.320 align:start position:0%
than that um for that but a lot of the
 
02:01:23.149 --> 02:01:23.159 align:start position:0%
money did go out the doors while the
 
02:01:24.870 --> 02:01:24.880 align:start position:0%
providers to help us meet the need for
 
02:01:26.629 --> 02:01:26.639 align:start position:0%
the covid so there wasn't a whole lot
 
02:01:30.229 --> 02:01:30.239 align:start position:0%
inhouse but I I think that said there's
 
02:01:32.189 --> 02:01:32.199 align:start position:0%
a lot of what we're looking at now that
 
02:01:33.830 --> 02:01:33.840 align:start position:0%
we can be doing it differently and more
 
02:01:35.350 --> 02:01:35.360 align:start position:0%
efficiently and we want to keep moving
 
02:01:36.990 --> 02:01:37.000 align:start position:0%
forward in that direction and not go
 
02:01:39.550 --> 02:01:39.560 align:start position:0%
back to the way that it was right so
 
02:01:41.750 --> 02:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
that is our our main mission and vision
 
02:01:41.760 --> 02:01:44.870 align:start position:0%
that is our our main mission and vision
moving

02:01:44.870 --> 02:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:47.830 --> 02:01:47.840 align:start position:0%
forward thank
 
02:01:50.430 --> 02:01:50.440 align:start position:0%
you all right I'm keeping an eye on here
 
02:01:55.910 --> 02:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:59.149 --> 02:01:59.159 align:start position:0%
so in terms of budget decreases and
 
02:02:01.589 --> 02:02:01.599 align:start position:0%
increases a lot of the same things in
 
02:02:03.430 --> 02:02:03.440 align:start position:0%
terms of the work wouldn't get done or
 
02:02:06.069 --> 02:02:06.079 align:start position:0%
Staffing would be impacted um and
 
02:02:07.470 --> 02:02:07.480 align:start position:0%
oftentimes when there's a decrease
 
02:02:08.870 --> 02:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
people think let's just close the
 
02:02:11.030 --> 02:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
district office well it makes it sounds
 
02:02:12.430 --> 02:02:12.440 align:start position:0%
like it might make sense but obviously
 
02:02:14.189 --> 02:02:14.199 align:start position:0%
that's a complicated thing but we are
 
02:02:17.069 --> 02:02:17.079 align:start position:0%
looking at trying to not necessarily as
 
02:02:18.870 --> 02:02:18.880 align:start position:0%
I said be in our B brick and mortar but
 
02:02:20.589 --> 02:02:20.599 align:start position:0%
we're still servicing throughout the
 
02:02:22.229 --> 02:02:22.239 align:start position:0%
state and not necessarily from one
 
02:02:24.669 --> 02:02:24.679 align:start position:0%
location so when you think about all the
 
02:02:28.229 --> 02:02:28.239 align:start position:0%
eligibility uh that is Citizens say need
 
02:02:30.270 --> 02:02:30.280 align:start position:0%
help right they often would come into
 
02:02:31.990 --> 02:02:32.000 align:start position:0%
our brick and mortar we found that they
 
02:02:34.189 --> 02:02:34.199 align:start position:0%
could actually uh be calling in and
 
02:02:36.189 --> 02:02:36.199 align:start position:0%
getting determined eligibility either
 
02:02:37.750 --> 02:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
through the system or through a phone
 
02:02:40.229 --> 02:02:40.239 align:start position:0%
call so we want if we can keep doing
 
02:02:41.390 --> 02:02:41.400 align:start position:0%
that and we don't need to have the
 
02:02:42.510 --> 02:02:42.520 align:start position:0%
building then that's what we're going to
 
02:02:44.430 --> 02:02:44.440 align:start position:0%
keep doing so that speaks to what I was
 
02:02:46.550 --> 02:02:46.560 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
02:02:48.910 --> 02:02:48.920 align:start position:0%
before Oh we we'll always have somebody
 
02:02:50.390 --> 02:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
that needs to come into a building don't
 
02:02:51.950 --> 02:02:51.960 align:start position:0%
get me wrong um we will always have have
 
02:02:53.390 --> 02:02:53.400 align:start position:0%
a need for some sense of brick and
 
02:02:55.510 --> 02:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
mortar but not as big so this is our
 
02:02:57.390 --> 02:02:57.400 align:start position:0%
current square footage this is the when
 
02:02:59.229 --> 02:02:59.239 align:start position:0%
you look at all of the properties that
 
02:03:02.629 --> 02:03:02.639 align:start position:0%
we have historically um I'm reminding
 
02:03:04.510 --> 02:03:04.520 align:start position:0%
you that some of these leases are five
 
02:03:06.390 --> 02:03:06.400 align:start position:0%
uh 10year leases um that's how we're
 
02:03:08.669 --> 02:03:08.679 align:start position:0%
able to get a decent rate long-term
 
02:03:10.629 --> 02:03:10.639 align:start position:0%
lease and then you can see the lease
 
02:03:13.750 --> 02:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
expirations so as we move towards those
 
02:03:15.950 --> 02:03:15.960 align:start position:0%
leases coming up we will look at and
 
02:03:17.870 --> 02:03:17.880 align:start position:0%
Claremont is a really good example right
 
02:03:20.350 --> 02:03:20.360 align:start position:0%
now State owns a Claremont building but
 
02:03:23.149 --> 02:03:23.159 align:start position:0%
we're looking the downsize we found uh
 
02:03:24.870 --> 02:03:24.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate space because we know we're
 
02:03:27.229 --> 02:03:27.239 align:start position:0%
not going to be 100% uh in the building
 
02:03:30.669 --> 02:03:30.679 align:start position:0%
some will be Tor so we'll be able to um
 
02:03:32.589 --> 02:03:32.599 align:start position:0%
even though it's state owned we pay D
 
02:03:34.350 --> 02:03:34.360 align:start position:0%
rent we pay them rent so we found
 
02:03:37.030 --> 02:03:37.040 align:start position:0%
property that would be uh equivalent or
 
02:03:38.950 --> 02:03:38.960 align:start position:0%
less to paying that so that that will be
 
02:03:44.549 --> 02:03:44.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:49.310 --> 02:03:49.320 align:start position:0%
forward and Staffing we have um I went
 
02:03:51.149 --> 02:03:51.159 align:start position:0%
through this before about 25 staff for
 
02:03:52.790 --> 02:03:52.800 align:start position:0%
the maintenance and then three and a
 
02:03:57.310 --> 02:03:57.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:04.109 --> 02:04:04.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:06.709 --> 02:04:06.719 align:start position:0%
well any questions on the on the
 
02:04:09.790 --> 02:04:09.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:09.800 --> 02:04:11.990 align:start position:0%
 
than

02:04:11.990 --> 02:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
than
 
02:04:15.790 --> 02:04:15.800 align:start position:0%
that not not today I I I might I might
 
02:04:19.750 --> 02:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
want to talk to you later about renting
 
02:04:21.870 --> 02:04:21.880 align:start position:0%
and buying and just more what you're
 
02:04:24.709 --> 02:04:24.719 align:start position:0%
thinking long term but but not for the
 
02:04:24.719 --> 02:04:25.830 align:start position:0%
thinking long term but but not for the
this

02:04:25.830 --> 02:04:25.840 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:04:30.950 --> 02:04:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:33.950 --> 02:04:33.960 align:start position:0%
good so I you're done with me now I'm
 
02:04:36.669 --> 02:04:36.679 align:start position:0%
going to turn it over to uh Ann Landry
 
02:04:38.390 --> 02:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
who is our associate commissioner and
 
02:04:39.830 --> 02:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
she's going to talk about the office of
 
02:04:41.709 --> 02:04:41.719 align:start position:0%
Health Equity which is the last
 
02:04:43.629 --> 02:04:43.639 align:start position:0%
component to this presentation right
 
02:04:47.709 --> 02:04:47.719 align:start position:0%
here thank you thanks Lori good
 
02:04:49.350 --> 02:04:49.360 align:start position:0%
afternoon everyone thank you so much

of one of my first questions here is I'm
 
02:05:00.910 --> 02:05:00.920 align:start position:0%
looking at the term Equity showing up in
 
02:05:03.830 --> 02:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
in healthc care documents everywhere is
 
02:05:06.390 --> 02:05:06.400 align:start position:0%
is this a statutory name or did is this
 
02:05:09.310 --> 02:05:09.320 align:start position:0%
like the old Refugee office what what

education so this is the um former um
 
02:05:49.790 --> 02:05:49.800 align:start position:0%
office it's the the name evolved over
 
02:05:51.589 --> 02:05:51.599 align:start position:0%
the last two years um it is the office
 
02:05:53.709 --> 02:05:53.719 align:start position:0%
office of minority health and minority

Refugee Health that started in
 
02:05:58.549 --> 02:05:58.559 align:start position:0%
1999 um I believe about four years ago
 
02:06:00.629 --> 02:06:00.639 align:start position:0%
the name um and Barbara can correct me
 
02:06:01.990 --> 02:06:02.000 align:start position:0%

02:06:05.350 --> 02:06:05.360 align:start position:0%
office of Health Equity to be more um
 
02:06:07.270 --> 02:06:07.280 align:start position:0%

02:06:09.069 --> 02:06:09.079 align:start position:0%
comprehensive of all the services that
 
02:06:13.109 --> 02:06:13.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:18.870 --> 02:06:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:21.750 --> 02:06:21.760 align:start position:0%

Equity Finance director is already in
 
02:07:04.149 --> 02:07:04.159 align:start position:0%
the room okay so the office of Health
 
02:07:06.589 --> 02:07:06.599 align:start position:0%
Equity assures Equitable access to
 
02:07:08.910 --> 02:07:08.920 align:start position:0%

language gender and sexual minorities
 
02:07:17.790 --> 02:07:17.800 align:start position:0%
and individuals with disabilities and I
 
02:07:19.510 --> 02:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
promise I won't read the slides I just
 
02:07:21.910 --> 02:07:21.920 align:start position:0%
really wanted to read this particular
 
02:07:23.870 --> 02:07:23.880 align:start position:0%
sentence since it captures so much of
 
02:07:26.709 --> 02:07:26.719 align:start position:0%
what we do um through the office of
 
02:07:28.910 --> 02:07:28.920 align:start position:0%
Health Equity we facilitate
 
02:07:31.430 --> 02:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
communication access across all dhh
 
02:07:33.510 --> 02:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
programs and services for all of the
 
02:07:37.790 --> 02:07:37.800 align:start position:0%
individuals needing interpretation um
 
02:07:40.430 --> 02:07:40.440 align:start position:0%
translation both the clients we serve
 
02:07:43.910 --> 02:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
and our staff we do a lot of Education
 
02:07:46.830 --> 02:07:46.840 align:start position:0%
around um communication access and the
 
02:07:49.350 --> 02:07:49.360 align:start position:0%
use of hearing assisted technology um
 
02:07:51.709 --> 02:07:51.719 align:start position:0%
vision and speech AIDS we monitor
 
02:07:53.669 --> 02:07:53.679 align:start position:0%
contract compliance with all of our
 
02:07:55.510 --> 02:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
vendors to ensure that they are
 
02:07:57.430 --> 02:07:57.440 align:start position:0%
following the federal civil rights law
 
02:07:59.030 --> 02:07:59.040 align:start position:0%
requirements including the training
 
02:07:59.040 --> 02:07:59.950 align:start position:0%
requirements including the training
that's

02:07:59.950 --> 02:07:59.960 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:08:02.830 --> 02:08:02.840 align:start position:0%
necessary um when we assist refugees in
 
02:08:04.629 --> 02:08:04.639 align:start position:0%
achieving the self-sufficiency at the
 
02:08:06.790 --> 02:08:06.800 align:start position:0%
earliest date possible after their
 
02:08:10.510 --> 02:08:10.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:13.430 --> 02:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
States um on the next Slide the next two
 
02:08:15.510 --> 02:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
slides really capture these I'm gonna
 
02:08:17.830 --> 02:08:17.840 align:start position:0%
probably wave my hand a couple of times
 
02:08:21.629 --> 02:08:21.639 align:start position:0%
if uh sure of course if we could go back
 
02:08:25.390 --> 02:08:25.400 align:start position:0%
this slide is okay so it it seems to me
 
02:08:27.870 --> 02:08:27.880 align:start position:0%
like you have an interesting combination
 
02:08:30.189 --> 02:08:30.199 align:start position:0%
of services that you provide here it
 
02:08:33.510 --> 02:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
seems like you have a lot of direct
 
02:08:37.390 --> 02:08:37.400 align:start position:0%
population touching of actual people and
 
02:08:40.310 --> 02:08:40.320 align:start position:0%
then you have this legal compliance
 
02:08:40.320 --> 02:08:42.109 align:start position:0%
then you have this legal compliance
function

02:08:42.109 --> 02:08:42.119 align:start position:0%
function
 
02:08:46.270 --> 02:08:46.280 align:start position:0%
also and I'm just so my my thought is
 
02:08:48.470 --> 02:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
are those really are those really
 
02:08:52.030 --> 02:08:52.040 align:start position:0%
compatible within one Department to have
 
02:08:55.990 --> 02:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
s contractual civil rights compliance
 
02:09:01.470 --> 02:09:01.480 align:start position:0%
function with um population Services
 
02:09:05.350 --> 02:09:05.360 align:start position:0%
function well and I will um let Barbara
 
02:09:07.510 --> 02:09:07.520 align:start position:0%
jump in as well given her time here in
 
02:09:10.950 --> 02:09:10.960 align:start position:0%
this office and um perhaps Lori Weaver
 
02:09:13.189 --> 02:09:13.199 align:start position:0%
might have um additional information but
 
02:09:14.870 --> 02:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
I I do think it's appropriate in this
 
02:09:17.669 --> 02:09:17.679 align:start position:0%
sense because the federal civil rights
 
02:09:20.310 --> 02:09:20.320 align:start position:0%
law piece of it is really to ensure that
 
02:09:22.990 --> 02:09:23.000 align:start position:0%
our any contract that we have across the
 
02:09:26.510 --> 02:09:26.520 align:start position:0%
department is adhering to the ability to
 
02:09:30.430 --> 02:09:30.440 align:start position:0%
provide access um for their clients they
 
02:09:32.910 --> 02:09:32.920 align:start position:0%
serve so as we know we we have some
 
02:09:34.750 --> 02:09:34.760 align:start position:0%
direct service programs that we contract
 
02:09:37.109 --> 02:09:37.119 align:start position:0%
out a lot as well and we need to make
 
02:09:39.229 --> 02:09:39.239 align:start position:0%
sure that everyone across the state has
 
02:09:41.109 --> 02:09:41.119 align:start position:0%
Equitable access to the programs as far
 
02:09:45.750 --> 02:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
as translation um interpretation Etc and
 
02:09:48.830 --> 02:09:48.840 align:start position:0%
then we also have within our office we
 
02:09:51.830 --> 02:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
do serve your right internal and
 
02:09:53.870 --> 02:09:53.880 align:start position:0%
external so we ensure that our staff are
 
02:09:57.709 --> 02:09:57.719 align:start position:0%
trained our staff are educated we we are
 
02:10:00.149 --> 02:10:00.159 align:start position:0%
um creating equable opportunities um
 
02:10:02.149 --> 02:10:02.159 align:start position:0%
across the board within our department
 
02:10:04.069 --> 02:10:04.079 align:start position:0%
but then also to those that we directly
 
02:10:06.589 --> 02:10:06.599 align:start position:0%
serve as well and I'll ask Barbara do
 
02:10:12.830 --> 02:10:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:15.470 --> 02:10:15.480 align:start position:0%
well um I think it's I think you made
 
02:10:18.950 --> 02:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
the point that it's compatible in that
 
02:10:22.189 --> 02:10:22.199 align:start position:0%
um we're Ser we're serving primarily the
 
02:10:24.870 --> 02:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
same group of clients or portions of the
 
02:10:28.270 --> 02:10:28.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:31.149 --> 02:10:31.159 align:start position:0%
clients well so so I don't want to throw
 
02:10:32.750 --> 02:10:32.760 align:start position:0%
you off because the whole budget is
 
02:10:35.629 --> 02:10:35.639 align:start position:0%
built around this notion but maybe uh
 
02:10:37.510 --> 02:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
Miss Weaver someday we could have a
 
02:10:40.030 --> 02:10:40.040 align:start position:0%
conversation about whether the federal
 
02:10:42.310 --> 02:10:42.320 align:start position:0%
civil rights law compliance function
 
02:10:44.750 --> 02:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
since it monitors contractor compliance
 
02:10:46.910 --> 02:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
whether that should go over with the
 
02:10:48.990 --> 02:10:49.000 align:start position:0%
procurement and contracts group if that
 
02:10:52.229 --> 02:10:52.239 align:start position:0%
would be a a more logical subject matter
 
02:10:55.149 --> 02:10:55.159 align:start position:0%
alignment but but that that's not for
 
02:10:57.669 --> 02:10:57.679 align:start position:0%
today because we are we're definitely
 
02:11:00.669 --> 02:11:00.679 align:start position:0%
into the budget and everything is where
 
02:11:03.669 --> 02:11:03.679 align:start position:0%
it's at now but I I just be would be
 
02:11:06.950 --> 02:11:06.960 align:start position:0%
curious long term if if that if that's
 
02:11:09.709 --> 02:11:09.719 align:start position:0%
really the right spot for it I will I
 
02:11:11.629 --> 02:11:11.639 align:start position:0%
will add um representative Edwards I
 
02:11:13.589 --> 02:11:13.599 align:start position:0%
appreciate that question because well it
 
02:11:15.830 --> 02:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
is very much in partnership with the
 
02:11:19.030 --> 02:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
contracts unit so I think you know
 
02:11:20.589 --> 02:11:20.599 align:start position:0%
there's two pieces of it right there's a
 
02:11:22.990 --> 02:11:23.000 align:start position:0%
day-to-day cont the programmatic aspects
 
02:11:26.350 --> 02:11:26.360 align:start position:0%
of it as well as the responsibilities
 
02:11:28.030 --> 02:11:28.040 align:start position:0%
that lie in the contract office so it's
 
02:11:30.790 --> 02:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
very much in Partnership um with the
 
02:11:35.990 --> 02:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:38.390 --> 02:11:38.400 align:start position:0%
helpful um and if I can add
 
02:11:40.390 --> 02:11:40.400 align:start position:0%
representative adwards Anella kushit
 
02:11:44.069 --> 02:11:44.079 align:start position:0%
again um it really is referring to U the
 
02:11:46.669 --> 02:11:46.679 align:start position:0%
title six the federal civil rights law
 
02:11:51.549 --> 02:11:51.559 align:start position:0%
um Ada of 1990 and um rehab Act of 1973
 
02:11:54.310 --> 02:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
all those have to be implemented in our
 
02:11:56.870 --> 02:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
um communication access plan and in our
 
02:11:59.270 --> 02:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
trainings and our staff needs to know
 
02:12:01.709 --> 02:12:01.719 align:start position:0%
the civil rights in order to um
 
02:12:04.390 --> 02:12:04.400 align:start position:0%
equitably serve uh population of New
 
02:12:07.669 --> 02:12:07.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:10.069 --> 02:12:10.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you okay so that's a
 
02:12:11.910 --> 02:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
good clarification because I was
 
02:12:14.589 --> 02:12:14.599 align:start position:0%
focusing on the first many words of that
 
02:12:16.910 --> 02:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
description where it says monitors
 
02:12:19.030 --> 02:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
contract compliance with federal civil
 
02:12:21.470 --> 02:12:21.480 align:start position:0%
rights law requirements and you're
 
02:12:24.270 --> 02:12:24.280 align:start position:0%
emphasizing appropriately the training
 
02:12:26.870 --> 02:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
and self-attestation
 
02:12:30.589 --> 02:12:30.599 align:start position:0%
checklist all right well so I have much
 
02:12:33.669 --> 02:12:33.679 align:start position:0%

communication Access program which as
 
02:12:46.669 --> 02:12:46.679 align:start position:0%
you can see it serves the limited
 
02:12:48.709 --> 02:12:48.719 align:start position:0%
English proficient dab heart of hearing

02:13:28.629 --> 02:13:28.639 align:start position:0%
layoffs or closing of a business so very
 
02:13:31.149 --> 02:13:31.159 align:start position:0%
actively involved in that
 
02:13:33.790 --> 02:13:33.800 align:start position:0%
work um as we move to the next we have
 
02:13:35.990 --> 02:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
the minority health program which is a
 
02:13:38.790 --> 02:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
little bit of a legacy um name because
 
02:13:40.549 --> 02:13:40.559 align:start position:0%
it encompasses much more than just
 
02:13:42.189 --> 02:13:42.199 align:start position:0%
minority Health there's a lot of
 
02:13:43.950 --> 02:13:43.960 align:start position:0%
training and technical assistance to
 
02:13:46.149 --> 02:13:46.159 align:start position:0%
both staff and contractors and Community
 
02:13:48.350 --> 02:13:48.360 align:start position:0%
stakeholders on culturally effective
 
02:13:50.470 --> 02:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
organizations and the education around
 
02:13:53.189 --> 02:13:53.199 align:start position:0%
enhanced ational class standards we
 
02:13:55.149 --> 02:13:55.159 align:start position:0%
serve the racial ethnic language and
 
02:13:56.549 --> 02:13:56.559 align:start position:0%
gender and sexual minorities and
 
02:13:57.950 --> 02:13:57.960 align:start position:0%
individuals with disabilities through
 
02:14:00.709 --> 02:14:00.719 align:start position:0%
program planning and partnership um and
 
02:14:02.790 --> 02:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
we improve our own internal capacity at
 
02:14:06.629 --> 02:14:06.639 align:start position:0%
DJs to ensure Equitable access to um
 
02:14:09.149 --> 02:14:09.159 align:start position:0%
quality services to all individuals
 
02:14:11.350 --> 02:14:11.360 align:start position:0%
there's a small piece of our program
 
02:14:14.430 --> 02:14:14.440 align:start position:0%
that uh our office that does rep
 
02:14:19.030 --> 02:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
repatriation um and that's it's not a
 
02:14:21.669 --> 02:14:21.679 align:start position:0%
ton of um of work in our office but if
 
02:14:24.709 --> 02:14:24.719 align:start position:0%
there is someone who needs to um come
 
02:14:27.030 --> 02:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
back to the US into New Hampshire um
 
02:14:29.310 --> 02:14:29.320 align:start position:0%
gero works there and then of course we
 
02:14:30.870 --> 02:14:30.880 align:start position:0%
have the state Refugee program which
 
02:14:32.549 --> 02:14:32.559 align:start position:0%
serves all the refugees within their
 
02:14:35.270 --> 02:14:35.280 align:start position:0%
first five years um to the US in New
 
02:14:37.950 --> 02:14:37.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that's a federal program um
 
02:14:40.350 --> 02:14:40.360 align:start position:0%
each state has a state Refugee program
 
02:14:42.629 --> 02:14:42.639 align:start position:0%
it's very very specific to the Federal
 
02:14:45.069 --> 02:14:45.079 align:start position:0%
Regulations Barbara has been the
 
02:14:46.510 --> 02:14:46.520 align:start position:0%
director of that program for quite a
 
02:14:47.629 --> 02:14:47.639 align:start position:0%
while so I'm going to give her the
 
02:14:50.069 --> 02:14:50.079 align:start position:0%
opportunity to to mention highlight any
 
02:14:52.350 --> 02:14:52.360 align:start position:0%
of um any pieces you want to of that
 
02:14:52.360 --> 02:14:53.470 align:start position:0%
of um any pieces you want to of that
program

02:14:53.470 --> 02:14:53.480 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:14:57.270 --> 02:14:57.280 align:start position:0%
Barbara okay um well we work work
 
02:14:59.430 --> 02:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
primarily to help refugees achieve
 
02:15:01.310 --> 02:15:01.320 align:start position:0%
self-sufficiency at the earliest date
 
02:15:02.910 --> 02:15:02.920 align:start position:0%
possible after their arrival to the
 
02:15:05.430 --> 02:15:05.440 align:start position:0%
United States so there are several
 
02:15:07.310 --> 02:15:07.320 align:start position:0%
mandatory components of the program
 
02:15:09.910 --> 02:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
including comprehensive health screening
 
02:15:12.870 --> 02:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
which also occurs overseas um currently
 
02:15:16.669 --> 02:15:16.679 align:start position:0%
people are quarantined 14 days for covid
 
02:15:19.549 --> 02:15:19.559 align:start position:0%
but the bulk of our work um occurs in
 
02:15:24.390 --> 02:15:24.400 align:start position:0%
the first 12 months of within of arrival
 
02:15:29.189 --> 02:15:29.199 align:start position:0%
um and we we contract out to
 
02:15:33.549 --> 02:15:33.559 align:start position:0%
um to the to agencies who help refugees
 
02:15:37.270 --> 02:15:37.280 align:start position:0%
seek employment um we develop employment
 
02:15:39.069 --> 02:15:39.079 align:start position:0%
opportunities for them we provide
 
02:15:41.870 --> 02:15:41.880 align:start position:0%
English as a second language and case
 
02:15:45.229 --> 02:15:45.239 align:start position:0%
management to help them integrate into
 
02:15:47.910 --> 02:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
their communities within the first year
 
02:15:51.470 --> 02:15:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:51.480 --> 02:15:55.149 align:start position:0%
 
thanks

02:15:55.149 --> 02:15:55.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:57.990 --> 02:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
par so this slide looks familiar to you
 
02:16:00.870 --> 02:16:00.880 align:start position:0%
now um as Lori Weaver just highlighted
 
02:16:02.750 --> 02:16:02.760 align:start position:0%
with our district offices this is really
 
02:16:05.709 --> 02:16:05.719 align:start position:0%
our delivery system as well for our um
 
02:16:08.589 --> 02:16:08.599 align:start position:0%
communication access encounters so you
 
02:16:11.069 --> 02:16:11.079 align:start position:0%
can see the volume throughout the state
 
02:16:13.149 --> 02:16:13.159 align:start position:0%
I'm not surprisingly concentrated more
 
02:16:16.149 --> 02:16:16.159 align:start position:0%
into in the urban areas of where we've
 
02:16:19.430 --> 02:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
served um the communication access needs
 
02:16:21.030 --> 02:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
of our assistants I mean of our
 
02:16:22.589 --> 02:16:22.599 align:start position:0%
residents and staff and this includes
 
02:16:26.350 --> 02:16:26.360 align:start position:0%
inperson over the phone video as well as
 
02:16:28.750 --> 02:16:28.760 align:start position:0%
captioning of real-time translation for
 
02:16:31.390 --> 02:16:31.400 align:start position:0%
those of heart Healing Heart ad hearing
 
02:16:32.870 --> 02:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
and then the map of course is our
 
02:16:37.190 --> 02:16:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:40.509 --> 02:16:40.519 align:start position:0%
saw um this is a snapshot of the summary
 
02:16:42.950 --> 02:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
of individuals served since 2015 with
 
02:16:44.589 --> 02:16:44.599 align:start position:0%
our two main programs which are the
 
02:16:45.950 --> 02:16:45.960 align:start position:0%
state Refugee program and the
 
02:16:48.509 --> 02:16:48.519 align:start position:0%
communication Access program so you'll
 
02:16:50.190 --> 02:16:50.200 align:start position:0%
see that there's about a thousand
 
02:16:52.389 --> 02:16:52.399 align:start position:0%
residents um each year from the state
 
02:16:54.589 --> 02:16:54.599 align:start position:0%
Refugee program and then you'll see the
 
02:16:57.190 --> 02:16:57.200 align:start position:0%
total number of encounters I'm part of
 
02:16:58.709 --> 02:16:58.719 align:start position:0%
the reduction in the state Refugee
 
02:17:00.950 --> 02:17:00.960 align:start position:0%
program of those served has to do with
 
02:17:04.309 --> 02:17:04.319 align:start position:0%
the federal um administrations um the
 
02:17:06.030 --> 02:17:06.040 align:start position:0%
changes over the last years and there
 
02:17:07.270 --> 02:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
was a reduction in the number of
 
02:17:09.349 --> 02:17:09.359 align:start position:0%
refugees allowed to enter the US
 
02:17:12.910 --> 02:17:12.920 align:start position:0%
Representative Edwards so so each of
 
02:17:16.030 --> 02:17:16.040 align:start position:0%
these are annual numbers and because we
 
02:17:19.349 --> 02:17:19.359 align:start position:0%
helped them for five years there's a a a
 
02:17:19.359 --> 02:17:21.270 align:start position:0%
helped them for five years there's a a a
cumulative

02:17:21.270 --> 02:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
cumulative
 
02:17:25.589 --> 02:17:25.599 align:start position:0%
uh also so so between 2015 and
 
02:17:30.589 --> 02:17:30.599 align:start position:0%
2019 it's really more like um say
 
02:17:34.790 --> 02:17:34.800 align:start position:0%
10,500 total in the population served is
 
02:17:37.669 --> 02:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
that am I reading your graph
 
02:17:41.150 --> 02:17:41.160 align:start position:0%
right I'm going to allow Barbara to I'm
 
02:17:43.349 --> 02:17:43.359 align:start position:0%
gonna ask Barbara yeah this doesn't
 
02:17:45.150 --> 02:17:45.160 align:start position:0%
represent the arrivals through the
 
02:17:47.589 --> 02:17:47.599 align:start position:0%
program this represents service to
 
02:17:49.309 --> 02:17:49.319 align:start position:0%
clients who are already in the United
 
02:17:51.629 --> 02:17:51.639 align:start position:0%
States so we're allowed to serve people
 
02:17:53.709 --> 02:17:53.719 align:start position:0%
within our federal regulations for up to
 
02:17:57.790 --> 02:17:57.800 align:start position:0%
five years so this this represents that
 
02:18:00.030 --> 02:18:00.040 align:start position:0%
last year we only resettled 48
 
02:18:03.270 --> 02:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
individuals in New Hampshire oh okay I
 
02:18:05.309 --> 02:18:05.319 align:start position:0%
didn't know how to interpret the number
 
02:18:08.389 --> 02:18:08.399 align:start position:0%
whether it was the the total uh
 
02:18:10.389 --> 02:18:10.399 align:start position:0%
population or or just an annual
 
02:18:13.589 --> 02:18:13.599 align:start position:0%
population so thank you you're welcome
 
02:18:17.030 --> 02:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:17.040 --> 02:18:19.349 align:start position:0%
 
clarifying

02:18:19.349 --> 02:18:19.359 align:start position:0%
clarifying
 
02:18:21.509 --> 02:18:21.519 align:start position:0%
okay these are some of our key
 
02:18:23.509 --> 02:18:23.519 align:start position:0%
accomplishments over the past couple of
 
02:18:25.709 --> 02:18:25.719 align:start position:0%
years in the office of Health Equity I
 
02:18:27.190 --> 02:18:27.200 align:start position:0%
don't want to read each bullet but you
 
02:18:31.030 --> 02:18:31.040 align:start position:0%
really can see um the success rate in
 
02:18:33.110 --> 02:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
what our state Refugee program is doing
 
02:18:36.230 --> 02:18:36.240 align:start position:0%
in the first few as far as um the number
 
02:18:39.709 --> 02:18:39.719 align:start position:0%
of undo refugees receiving Services um
 
02:18:43.070 --> 02:18:43.080 align:start position:0%
the percentage that 89% of employable
 
02:18:44.990 --> 02:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
refugees enter employment with average
 
02:18:47.110 --> 02:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
hourly wage of
 
02:18:50.950 --> 02:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
$12.93 100% are completing orientation
 
02:18:52.230 --> 02:18:52.240 align:start position:0%
completing comprehensive health
 
02:18:54.150 --> 02:18:54.160 align:start position:0%
screening are graduating from high
 
02:18:56.549 --> 02:18:56.559 align:start position:0%
school um and moving on to higher
 
02:18:59.349 --> 02:18:59.359 align:start position:0%
education in a lot of cases then you can
 
02:19:02.230 --> 02:19:02.240 align:start position:0%
see that we've educated 387 Community
 
02:19:05.150 --> 02:19:05.160 align:start position:0%
Partners um in the last year on uh
 
02:19:06.709 --> 02:19:06.719 align:start position:0%
hearing assisted technology
 
02:19:09.429 --> 02:19:09.439 align:start position:0%
communication access app so clearly a
 
02:19:11.910 --> 02:19:11.920 align:start position:0%
need across our state um even more so
 
02:19:15.070 --> 02:19:15.080 align:start position:0%
during this time of Co with remote um
 
02:19:18.709 --> 02:19:18.719 align:start position:0%
everything being remote we've also are
 
02:19:21.990 --> 02:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
um uh We've also provided 73 trainings
 
02:19:26.429 --> 02:19:26.439 align:start position:0%
on equity and um cultural standards and
 
02:19:28.349 --> 02:19:28.359 align:start position:0%
we've also partnered with Public Health
 
02:19:31.110 --> 02:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
on a covid-19 equity task force that's
 
02:19:35.110 --> 02:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
um comprised of uh about 50 community
 
02:19:37.309 --> 02:19:37.319 align:start position:0%
community stakeholders as well as
 
02:19:39.790 --> 02:19:39.800 align:start position:0%
developing an equity review tool um to
 
02:19:43.309 --> 02:19:43.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:46.110 --> 02:19:46.120 align:start position:0%
house some of our key challenges remain
 
02:19:48.910 --> 02:19:48.920 align:start position:0%
the same over the last few years so data
 
02:19:51.389 --> 02:19:51.399 align:start position:0%
um is nationally a challenge when it
 
02:19:53.469 --> 02:19:53.479 align:start position:0%
comes to collecting race and ethnicity
 
02:19:56.190 --> 02:19:56.200 align:start position:0%
data um I nationally there's a lot of
 
02:19:57.630 --> 02:19:57.640 align:start position:0%
improvement as well as here in New
 
02:19:59.630 --> 02:19:59.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we put a lot of effort on that
 
02:20:03.510 --> 02:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
um the obviously the pandemic has
 
02:20:06.429 --> 02:20:06.439 align:start position:0%
illuminated a lot of the disparities in
 
02:20:08.710 --> 02:20:08.720 align:start position:0%
Health Equity and so even there we were
 
02:20:11.590 --> 02:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
able to put um more resources behind
 
02:20:13.790 --> 02:20:13.800 align:start position:0%
collecting this data and really helping
 
02:20:16.510 --> 02:20:16.520 align:start position:0%
our internal and external Partners
 
02:20:17.790 --> 02:20:17.800 align:start position:0%
understand how to better collect race
 
02:20:20.270 --> 02:20:20.280 align:start position:0%
and ethy data so we can understand and
 
02:20:23.389 --> 02:20:23.399 align:start position:0%
Analysis and analyze information better
 
02:20:25.429 --> 02:20:25.439 align:start position:0%
there's also uncertainty um regarding
 
02:20:27.469 --> 02:20:27.479 align:start position:0%
changes at the federal level with each
 
02:20:29.230 --> 02:20:29.240 align:start position:0%
different change in administration how
 
02:20:31.750 --> 02:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
that impacts our Target populations with
 
02:20:34.150 --> 02:20:34.160 align:start position:0%
um the refugee program as Barbara was
 
02:20:35.990 --> 02:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
mentioning and we're also in a
 
02:20:37.710 --> 02:20:37.720 align:start position:0%
transition um right now with our
 
02:20:39.950 --> 02:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
leadership our director of the last 10
 
02:20:43.150 --> 02:20:43.160 align:start position:0%
years um resigned uh late last year and
 
02:20:44.309 --> 02:20:44.319 align:start position:0%
so of course there's always an
 
02:20:46.030 --> 02:20:46.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity and challenge with any new
 
02:20:48.110 --> 02:20:48.120 align:start position:0%
leadership change but in the meantime we
 
02:20:55.110 --> 02:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:57.750 --> 02:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
so um I know Lori touched on um
 
02:20:59.950 --> 02:20:59.960 align:start position:0%
succession planning at a high level at
 
02:21:02.270 --> 02:21:02.280 align:start position:0%
at the department but just looking at
 
02:21:04.309 --> 02:21:04.319 align:start position:0%
our office specifically we do have four
 
02:21:06.270 --> 02:21:06.280 align:start position:0%
vacant positions including the director
 
02:21:08.190 --> 02:21:08.200 align:start position:0%
so that is something that we will ask
 
02:21:09.830 --> 02:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
the director the new director to come in
 
02:21:12.990 --> 02:21:13.000 align:start position:0%
to really look at how to um ensure that
 
02:21:14.870 --> 02:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
we have coverage across all of our areas
 
02:21:17.870 --> 02:21:17.880 align:start position:0%
and that we're growing our staff um it
 
02:21:19.230 --> 02:21:19.240 align:start position:0%
it really the new leadership will
 
02:21:20.790 --> 02:21:20.800 align:start position:0%
present an opportunity to evolve the
 
02:21:22.550 --> 02:21:22.560 align:start position:0%
office's approach I mean a lot of what
 
02:21:24.750 --> 02:21:24.760 align:start position:0%
we do is really dependent on the funding
 
02:21:26.910 --> 02:21:26.920 align:start position:0%
that we receive um it's mostly Federal
 
02:21:30.230 --> 02:21:30.240 align:start position:0%
funding as you'll see but of course um
 
02:21:31.990 --> 02:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
there's an opportunity to be more
 
02:21:35.070 --> 02:21:35.080 align:start position:0%
strategic um in our work as well as as
 
02:21:37.550 --> 02:21:37.560 align:start position:0%
tactical delivery and so we'll be asking
 
02:21:39.270 --> 02:21:39.280 align:start position:0%
our new director to kind of look at what
 
02:21:41.150 --> 02:21:41.160 align:start position:0%
are other states doing in their office
 
02:21:45.910 --> 02:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
of Health Equity uh yes so so somebody's
 
02:21:48.710 --> 02:21:48.720 align:start position:0%
the interim director though who is that
 
02:21:51.469 --> 02:21:51.479 align:start position:0%
so we don't have an in term director so
 
02:21:53.670 --> 02:21:53.680 align:start position:0%
to speak I'm really serving in that role
 
02:21:55.750 --> 02:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
um the office of Health Health Equity
 
02:21:58.830 --> 02:21:58.840 align:start position:0%
falls under my portfolio anyway and so I
 
02:22:00.910 --> 02:22:00.920 align:start position:0%
really have just stepped in um and have
 
02:22:04.309 --> 02:22:04.319 align:start position:0%
been supporting the team um through uh
 
02:22:06.270 --> 02:22:06.280 align:start position:0%
the absence of a director so I guess
 
02:22:08.990 --> 02:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
it's essentially I am but we didn't
 
02:22:10.630 --> 02:22:10.640 align:start position:0%
point someone
 
02:22:12.550 --> 02:22:12.560 align:start position:0%
necessarily thank
 
02:22:16.630 --> 02:22:16.640 align:start position:0%
you thank you for stepping up um and so
 
02:22:18.030 --> 02:22:18.040 align:start position:0%
that's a little bit about where we are
 
02:22:19.510 --> 02:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
we're in the process recruiting right
 
02:22:21.830 --> 02:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
now and confident will will get get
 
02:22:25.429 --> 02:22:25.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:28.150 --> 02:22:28.160 align:start position:0%
shortly and just looking at you know
 
02:22:30.510 --> 02:22:30.520 align:start position:0%
what what our outcomes how they would
 
02:22:32.950 --> 02:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
change with a 5% increase or decrease in
 
02:22:35.070 --> 02:22:35.080 align:start position:0%
funding um if we were to receive more
 
02:22:37.230 --> 02:22:37.240 align:start position:0%
money we definitely increase the number
 
02:22:38.750 --> 02:22:38.760 align:start position:0%
of internal and external Equity
 
02:22:40.630 --> 02:22:40.640 align:start position:0%
trainings it's clearly very important
 
02:22:43.030 --> 02:22:43.040 align:start position:0%
across our state we would allow for more
 
02:22:44.710 --> 02:22:44.720 align:start position:0%
professional development opportunities
 
02:22:48.110 --> 02:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
and conferences and self growth for our
 
02:22:50.630 --> 02:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
staff and we' be able to expand
 
02:22:52.990 --> 02:22:53.000 align:start position:0%
translation services as well should we
 
02:22:55.270 --> 02:22:55.280 align:start position:0%
see a decrease we would unfortunately
 
02:22:56.790 --> 02:22:56.800 align:start position:0%
decrease the number of clients served
 
02:22:59.070 --> 02:22:59.080 align:start position:0%
with translation services we would have
 
02:23:01.429 --> 02:23:01.439 align:start position:0%
to reduce the number of trainings on
 
02:23:04.630 --> 02:23:04.640 align:start position:0%
equity and cultural linguistic standards
 
02:23:06.950 --> 02:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
and we would um potentially inhibit our
 
02:23:08.590 --> 02:23:08.600 align:start position:0%
ability to apply for and receive new
 
02:23:10.469 --> 02:23:10.479 align:start position:0%
grants because of course we need
 
02:23:13.950 --> 02:23:13.960 align:start position:0%
resources to do yes represent so on
 
02:23:17.590 --> 02:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
translation services are those uh is the
 
02:23:20.469 --> 02:23:20.479 align:start position:0%
scope of that related strictly to
 
02:23:23.309 --> 02:23:23.319 align:start position:0%
containing uh Health Services or those
 
02:23:26.309 --> 02:23:26.319 align:start position:0%
translation services expanded so that
 
02:23:29.389 --> 02:23:29.399 align:start position:0%
they can go contract for an apartment or
 
02:23:32.309 --> 02:23:32.319 align:start position:0%
they can interact properly at the Town
 
02:23:35.070 --> 02:23:35.080 align:start position:0%
Hall how what what's the scope and the
 
02:23:37.630 --> 02:23:37.640 align:start position:0%
boundary of the scope for translation
 
02:23:39.790 --> 02:23:39.800 align:start position:0%
services thank you for that question I'm
 
02:23:42.150 --> 02:23:42.160 align:start position:0%
actually gonna um ask Anella if she's
 
02:23:45.070 --> 02:23:45.080 align:start position:0%
much better at giving um a summary of of
 
02:23:48.190 --> 02:23:48.200 align:start position:0%
our scope here Anella are you still on
 
02:23:53.230 --> 02:23:53.240 align:start position:0%
yes I am thanks in um so the translation
 
02:23:56.990 --> 02:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
we work of the federal HHS rule um and
 
02:23:59.670 --> 02:23:59.680 align:start position:0%
so we will translate all vital documents
 
02:24:03.070 --> 02:24:03.080 align:start position:0%
into languages that meet 5% or 1,000
 
02:24:05.670 --> 02:24:05.680 align:start position:0%
whichever is lower and So currently only
 
02:24:08.550 --> 02:24:08.560 align:start position:0%
Spanish language meets that threshold
 
02:24:10.550 --> 02:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
and we will translate all vital
 
02:24:13.750 --> 02:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
documents across programs in the
 
02:24:16.990 --> 02:24:17.000 align:start position:0%
department um if the staff is receiving
 
02:24:19.070 --> 02:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
documents in another language in order
 
02:24:21.910 --> 02:24:21.920 align:start position:0%
for them to process or do their job they
 
02:24:23.910 --> 02:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
have to be able to access that document
 
02:24:26.070 --> 02:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
we do translate those into English so
 
02:24:29.710 --> 02:24:29.720 align:start position:0%
that we can do our jobs and then if the
 
02:24:32.070 --> 02:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
decision has to be sent in the language
 
02:24:34.150 --> 02:24:34.160 align:start position:0%
that family speaks we will then
 
02:24:36.309 --> 02:24:36.319 align:start position:0%
translate our decisions into those
 
02:24:39.030 --> 02:24:39.040 align:start position:0%
languages I hope that answer the
 
02:24:42.590 --> 02:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
question uh very very very nearly uh I'm
 
02:24:45.070 --> 02:24:45.080 align:start position:0%
just curious about the definition of a
 
02:24:48.030 --> 02:24:48.040 align:start position:0%
vital document is it vital strictly in
 
02:24:50.790 --> 02:24:50.800 align:start position:0%
the health care sense or vital to being
 
02:24:53.110 --> 02:24:53.120 align:start position:0%
able to be an independent
 
02:24:55.910 --> 02:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
adult for different programs it will be
 
02:24:57.870 --> 02:24:57.880 align:start position:0%
whatever that program identifies as a
 
02:25:00.590 --> 02:25:00.600 align:start position:0%
vital usually those are the consent
 
02:25:02.469 --> 02:25:02.479 align:start position:0%
anything that person has to sign they
 
02:25:03.830 --> 02:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
have to be able to understand what
 
02:25:05.990 --> 02:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
they're signing application for
 
02:25:08.550 --> 02:25:08.560 align:start position:0%
assistance um but it excludes things
 
02:25:13.790 --> 02:25:13.800 align:start position:0%
like flyers and um brochures unless it's
 
02:25:16.910 --> 02:25:16.920 align:start position:0%
um so so rights and responsibilities
 
02:25:19.750 --> 02:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
will be a vital document but here's
 
02:25:25.870 --> 02:25:25.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:30.910 --> 02:25:30.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:33.550 --> 02:25:33.560 align:start position:0%
you again just a breakdown of our
 
02:25:37.590 --> 02:25:37.600 align:start position:0%
recommended positions um across our
 
02:25:39.830 --> 02:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
office we have eight in the minority
 
02:25:41.550 --> 02:25:41.560 align:start position:0%
health and Refugee Affairs piece and
 
02:25:43.710 --> 02:25:43.720 align:start position:0%
then three in the refugee
 
02:25:43.720 --> 02:25:46.230 align:start position:0%
then three in the refugee
Services

02:25:46.230 --> 02:25:46.240 align:start position:0%
Services
 
02:25:50.710 --> 02:25:50.720 align:start position:0%
Unit um a breakdown of our funding as
 
02:25:53.389 --> 02:25:53.399 align:start position:0%
you can see we are primarily Federal
 
02:25:59.910 --> 02:25:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:02.429 --> 02:26:02.439 align:start position:0%
funds and here are the references to the
 
02:26:03.630 --> 02:26:03.640 align:start position:0%
budget book page numbers and the
 
02:26:05.990 --> 02:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
briefing book page
 
02:26:09.070 --> 02:26:09.080 align:start position:0%
numbers and that is it so I know I spoke
 
02:26:10.990 --> 02:26:11.000 align:start position:0%
really fast to get us in before your
 
02:26:13.870 --> 02:26:13.880 align:start position:0%
noon deadline there's a few minutes um
 
02:26:16.630 --> 02:26:16.640 align:start position:0%
left if you have any other questions or
 
02:26:19.710 --> 02:26:19.720 align:start position:0%
for for our office or for Karen or
 
02:26:21.309 --> 02:26:21.319 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
02:26:23.190 --> 02:26:23.200 align:start position:0%
very nice job are are there questions
 
02:26:24.630 --> 02:26:24.640 align:start position:0%
from the
 
02:26:28.349 --> 02:26:28.359 align:start position:0%
committee yes representative
 
02:26:31.190 --> 02:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
wer I have scheduled a pre fiscal at
 
02:26:34.070 --> 02:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
3:30 you think we'll be wrapped up by
 
02:26:36.870 --> 02:26:36.880 align:start position:0%
then so uh I was just going to go into
 
02:26:39.710 --> 02:26:39.720 align:start position:0%
that um we're we're going to uh shift
 
02:26:41.910 --> 02:26:41.920 align:start position:0%
things around a little bit we're going
 
02:26:45.030 --> 02:26:45.040 align:start position:0%
to take a a break for about 15 20
 
02:26:47.190 --> 02:26:47.200 align:start position:0%
minutes since most people are at home to
 
02:26:49.590 --> 02:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
to just get their lunch and get ready to
 
02:26:51.230 --> 02:26:51.240 align:start position:0%
start again
 
02:26:55.150 --> 02:26:55.160 align:start position:0%
um we'll start back up by 12 1220 and
 
02:26:58.190 --> 02:26:58.200 align:start position:0%
then we'll hit legal uh and we'll hit
 
02:27:00.469 --> 02:27:00.479 align:start position:0%
legal top to bottom from from the
 
02:27:03.910 --> 02:27:03.920 align:start position:0%
overview to the budget numbers because
 
02:27:07.830 --> 02:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
um um Miss St sier has to be gone at two
 
02:27:10.790 --> 02:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
two o'clock I think and then of the
 
02:27:12.830 --> 02:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
briefings we've heard so far the high
 
02:27:17.030 --> 02:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
level we'll go into the detail we're
 
02:27:17.990 --> 02:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
going to
 
02:27:23.230 --> 02:27:23.240 align:start position:0%
defer is until Monday um and what else
 
02:27:24.710 --> 02:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
are we deferring are we deferring
 
02:27:26.110 --> 02:27:26.120 align:start position:0%
anything else
 
02:27:30.389 --> 02:27:30.399 align:start position:0%
Kevin yes it would be uh tpq which is
 
02:27:34.469 --> 02:27:34.479 align:start position:0%
mer to lose right so so we're we're
 
02:27:36.190 --> 02:27:36.200 align:start position:0%
we're we're shifting around and and I
 
02:27:37.910 --> 02:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
think we're going to hit your 3:30
 
02:27:39.830 --> 02:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
timeline is it you said 3:30
 
02:27:43.150 --> 02:27:43.160 align:start position:0%
representative yes thank you yes sir
 
02:27:46.309 --> 02:27:46.319 align:start position:0%
okay so I'm sorry just to clarify chair
 
02:27:48.269 --> 02:27:48.279 align:start position:0%
you're suggesting that we'll go back to
 
02:27:49.830 --> 02:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
the accounting units from this morning's
 
02:27:49.840 --> 02:27:50.630 align:start position:0%
the accounting units from this morning's
present

02:27:50.630 --> 02:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
present
 
02:27:52.269 --> 02:27:52.279 align:start position:0%
as well this
 
02:27:54.750 --> 02:27:54.760 align:start position:0%
afternoon that's my that's that's my
 
02:27:57.750 --> 02:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
plan I'd like to let legal go through
 
02:28:00.670 --> 02:28:00.680 align:start position:0%
everything from top to bottom uh and
 
02:28:03.469 --> 02:28:03.479 align:start position:0%
then so she can be excused and then and
 
02:28:06.750 --> 02:28:06.760 align:start position:0%
then we'll start going accounting detail
 
02:28:08.750 --> 02:28:08.760 align:start position:0%
of just the Departments we've already

02:31:42.429 --> 02:31:42.439 align:start position:0%
services so on the agenda today it's
 
02:31:44.429 --> 02:31:44.439 align:start position:0%
just going over our legal uh and
 
02:31:46.349 --> 02:31:46.359 align:start position:0%
Regulatory Services some of the key
 
02:31:48.110 --> 02:31:48.120 align:start position:0%
Services the case loads and then key
 
02:31:51.830 --> 02:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
challenges that we have um in our
 
02:31:55.110 --> 02:31:55.120 align:start position:0%
office so the purpose the overview of
 
02:31:56.750 --> 02:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
legal and Regulatory Services is to
 
02:31:59.910 --> 02:31:59.920 align:start position:0%
ensure that we adhere to uh we adhere to
 
02:32:01.990 --> 02:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
and fairly apply our laws and
 
02:32:04.349 --> 02:32:04.359 align:start position:0%
regulations um in implementing
 
02:32:08.510 --> 02:32:08.520 align:start position:0%
legislative policy the five areas in
 
02:32:11.070 --> 02:32:11.080 align:start position:0%
which uh the office oversees is the
 
02:32:13.550 --> 02:32:13.560 align:start position:0%
Bureau of Licensing and certification uh
 
02:32:15.349 --> 02:32:15.359 align:start position:0%
the legal Bureau our administrative
 
02:32:17.790 --> 02:32:17.800 align:start position:0%
Appeals Unit our two EMB busman's
 
02:32:19.469 --> 02:32:19.479 align:start position:0%
offices and legislative Services which
 
02:32:22.269 --> 02:32:22.279 align:start position:0%
I'll get into a little bit
 
02:32:24.670 --> 02:32:24.680 align:start position:0%
more so under our Bureau of Licensing
 
02:32:26.510 --> 02:32:26.520 align:start position:0%
and certification we have child care
 
02:32:27.990 --> 02:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
licensing Health Facilities
 
02:32:30.190 --> 02:32:30.200 align:start position:0%
Administration Community residences and
 
02:32:32.830 --> 02:32:32.840 align:start position:0%
our life safety um survey team so I'll
 
02:32:34.630 --> 02:32:34.640 align:start position:0%
go through each of those our childcare
 
02:32:36.309 --> 02:32:36.319 align:start position:0%
licensing team they do on-site
 
02:32:37.990 --> 02:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
inspections at child care facilities
 
02:32:40.550 --> 02:32:40.560 align:start position:0%
those could be um center-based they
 
02:32:43.110 --> 02:32:43.120 align:start position:0%
could be family um based centers and
 
02:32:45.230 --> 02:32:45.240 align:start position:0%
then they also could be residential um
 
02:32:48.190 --> 02:32:48.200 align:start position:0%
care where children are placed from um
 
02:32:50.150 --> 02:32:50.160 align:start position:0%
all residential for for res residential
 
02:32:52.389 --> 02:32:52.399 align:start position:0%
reason for residential purposes for all
 
02:32:55.070 --> 02:32:55.080 align:start position:0%
different reasons including um kids who
 
02:32:59.230 --> 02:32:59.240 align:start position:0%
are um in the custody of DCF we also uh
 
02:33:02.389 --> 02:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
review and inspect licensed uh exempt
 
02:33:05.389 --> 02:33:05.399 align:start position:0%
providers and those are providers that
 
02:33:09.790 --> 02:33:09.800 align:start position:0%
um receive federal funds but are not
 
02:33:11.550 --> 02:33:11.560 align:start position:0%
subject to our State Licensing
 
02:33:14.429 --> 02:33:14.439 align:start position:0%
regulations because they have three or
 
02:33:16.550 --> 02:33:16.560 align:start position:0%
less children in their
 
02:33:20.670 --> 02:33:20.680 align:start position:0%
care so we we review for Ing we ensure
 
02:33:24.230 --> 02:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
compliance with state law uh also our
 
02:33:26.750 --> 02:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
administrative rules we approve and
 
02:33:29.150 --> 02:33:29.160 align:start position:0%
issue licenses um we do disciplinary
 
02:33:31.830 --> 02:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
action and uh oversee we also oversee
 
02:33:33.790 --> 02:33:33.800 align:start position:0%
summer and recreational camp licensing
 
02:33:35.790 --> 02:33:35.800 align:start position:0%
that is a very new thing for us we just
 
02:33:39.110 --> 02:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
took over um this year and it was a very
 
02:33:40.950 --> 02:33:40.960 align:start position:0%
strange year as you can all imagine when
 
02:33:45.190 --> 02:33:45.200 align:start position:0%
it came came to camps and Co so um so we
 
02:33:47.469 --> 02:33:47.479 align:start position:0%
uh you know I've given you numbers uh
 
02:33:50.469 --> 02:33:50.479 align:start position:0%
later on but they're a little they're a
 
02:33:51.870 --> 02:33:51.880 align:start position:0%
little squishy right now because it's
 
02:33:53.630 --> 02:33:53.640 align:start position:0%
unclear what a normal year would look
 
02:33:55.670 --> 02:33:55.680 align:start position:0%
like when it comes to camp
 
02:33:57.550 --> 02:33:57.560 align:start position:0%
licensing our health facilities
 
02:33:59.790 --> 02:33:59.800 align:start position:0%
Administration team oversees the basic
 
02:34:03.830 --> 02:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
standards for uh all Health Facilities
 
02:34:06.910 --> 02:34:06.920 align:start position:0%
that are uh that operate in the state
 
02:34:08.309 --> 02:34:08.319 align:start position:0%
those could be medical facilities
 
02:34:09.750 --> 02:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
residential care facilities and then
 
02:34:11.269 --> 02:34:11.279 align:start position:0%
non-residential Healthcare Providers
 
02:34:12.830 --> 02:34:12.840 align:start position:0%
which I'll get into a little bit more
 
02:34:13.990 --> 02:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
but that Health Facilities
 
02:34:16.070 --> 02:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
Administration has the licensing unit
 
02:34:18.389 --> 02:34:18.399 align:start position:0%
the certification unit and Community
 
02:34:20.469 --> 02:34:20.479 align:start position:0%
residences and I'll explain that on the
 
02:34:22.550 --> 02:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
next slide so Health Facilities
 
02:34:25.710 --> 02:34:25.720 align:start position:0%
licensing is uh our State Licensing
 
02:34:26.830 --> 02:34:26.840 align:start position:0%
rules and
 
02:34:29.710 --> 02:34:29.720 align:start position:0%
regulations uh it's the licensing of of
 
02:34:31.630 --> 02:34:31.640 align:start position:0%
all types of Health Facilities hospitals
 
02:34:33.630 --> 02:34:33.640 align:start position:0%
walking clinics nursing homes substance
 
02:34:35.150 --> 02:34:35.160 align:start position:0%
use disorder Residential Treatment
 
02:34:38.110 --> 02:34:38.120 align:start position:0%
Centers ambulatory surgical centers
 
02:34:40.349 --> 02:34:40.359 align:start position:0%
assisted living facilities and and
 
02:34:43.230 --> 02:34:43.240 align:start position:0%
whatnot so they obviously have statutes
 
02:34:45.070 --> 02:34:45.080 align:start position:0%
and rules that they have to comply to as
 
02:34:47.830 --> 02:34:47.840 align:start position:0%
well we have we investigate complaints
 
02:34:50.710 --> 02:34:50.720 align:start position:0%
we inspect them annually and we license
 
02:34:52.710 --> 02:34:52.720 align:start position:0%
them accordingly and take disciplinary
 
02:34:55.070 --> 02:34:55.080 align:start position:0%
action or enforcement action when
 
02:34:56.870 --> 02:34:56.880 align:start position:0%
necessary our health facility
 
02:35:00.030 --> 02:35:00.040 align:start position:0%
certification team is uh certification
 
02:35:04.750 --> 02:35:04.760 align:start position:0%
for Medicare Medicaid so me uh our
 
02:35:07.590 --> 02:35:07.600 align:start position:0%
nursing homes our hospitals all of those
 
02:35:09.150 --> 02:35:09.160 align:start position:0%
who receive funding from the federal
 
02:35:11.870 --> 02:35:11.880 align:start position:0%
government uh are required to be
 
02:35:15.750 --> 02:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
certified and so our survey team here at
 
02:35:17.830 --> 02:35:17.840 align:start position:0%
the department that's part of
 
02:35:20.469 --> 02:35:20.479 align:start position:0%
certification oversees
 
02:35:23.269 --> 02:35:23.279 align:start position:0%
and regulates based off of CMS
 
02:35:26.389 --> 02:35:26.399 align:start position:0%
regulation not based off of state law
 
02:35:30.389 --> 02:35:30.399 align:start position:0%
and Rule so their role is very specific
 
02:35:35.150 --> 02:35:35.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:37.670 --> 02:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
funded our next group under the Bureau
 
02:35:39.870 --> 02:35:39.880 align:start position:0%
of Licensing is community residences
 
02:35:41.309 --> 02:35:41.319 align:start position:0%
those residences care for
 
02:35:43.190 --> 02:35:43.200 align:start position:0%
developmentally disabled acquired brain
 
02:35:46.190 --> 02:35:46.200 align:start position:0%
disorder um and Behavioral Health um
 
02:35:48.590 --> 02:35:48.600 align:start position:0%
diagnosis folks uh those Community
 
02:35:51.830 --> 02:35:51.840 align:start position:0%
residences could have very small number
 
02:35:55.870 --> 02:35:55.880 align:start position:0%
of of um of individuals which in which
 
02:35:58.429 --> 02:35:58.439 align:start position:0%
they serve one or two and then they have
 
02:36:01.190 --> 02:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
licensed homes which are four or more um
 
02:36:03.550 --> 02:36:03.560 align:start position:0%
we don't have a a large number of
 
02:36:05.469 --> 02:36:05.479 align:start position:0%
licensed homes most of our community
 
02:36:09.269 --> 02:36:09.279 align:start position:0%
residences are small and there's
 
02:36:11.950 --> 02:36:11.960 align:start position:0%
approximately 1,200 of those in the
 
02:36:14.870 --> 02:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
state and they need to be certified they
 
02:36:17.150 --> 02:36:17.160 align:start position:0%
get certified for funding under our
 
02:36:19.110 --> 02:36:19.120 align:start position:0%
developmentally dis developmental
 
02:36:21.550 --> 02:36:21.560 align:start position:0%
disability program so the certification
 
02:36:23.830 --> 02:36:23.840 align:start position:0%
process is inspecting and ensuring that
 
02:36:25.070 --> 02:36:25.080 align:start position:0%
it's complying with the rules and
 
02:36:29.510 --> 02:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
regulations around state law and Rule um
 
02:36:32.910 --> 02:36:32.920 align:start position:0%
but it's not it's it's less of a it is a
 
02:36:34.790 --> 02:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
licensing function still but it is a

02:42:08.630 --> 02:42:08.640 align:start position:0%
autonomy I mean a um Anonymous excuse me
 
02:42:11.710 --> 02:42:11.720 align:start position:0%

02:42:14.030 --> 02:42:14.040 align:start position:0%
speak to somebody in the department and
 
02:42:15.630 --> 02:42:15.640 align:start position:0%

and complaints they'll analyze systems
 
02:42:25.070 --> 02:42:25.080 align:start position:0%
issues as well but they serve as a
 
02:42:26.510 --> 02:42:26.520 align:start position:0%
mediation they don't necessarily
 
02:42:27.990 --> 02:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
represent the department they don't
 
02:42:30.990 --> 02:42:31.000 align:start position:0%

02:42:32.950 --> 02:42:32.960 align:start position:0%
really there to kind of be that neutral
 
02:42:36.190 --> 02:42:36.200 align:start position:0%
to see where the problem May lie and if
 
02:42:38.550 --> 02:42:38.560 align:start position:0%
there's any way to resolve
 
02:42:40.710 --> 02:42:40.720 align:start position:0%
it that's different than the office of

they're having in those long-term care
 
02:43:11.910 --> 02:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
facilities so they provide consultation
 
02:43:13.910 --> 02:43:13.920 align:start position:0%

02:43:16.990 --> 02:43:17.000 align:start position:0%

um there's only a handful of individuals
 
02:43:30.429 --> 02:43:30.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:32.870 --> 02:43:32.880 align:start position:0%

care udman are their own accounting
 
02:46:55.349 --> 02:46:55.359 align:start position:0%
units representative Earth the other
 
02:46:57.150 --> 02:46:57.160 align:start position:0%
thing is we're we're we're going to
 
02:46:59.309 --> 02:46:59.319 align:start position:0%
immediately go into those accounting
 
02:47:02.070 --> 02:47:02.080 align:start position:0%
details uh after the presentation of
 
02:47:06.070 --> 02:47:06.080 align:start position:0%
this overview so I I I have I have a a
 
02:47:08.590 --> 02:47:08.600 align:start position:0%
question for you under these child care
 
02:47:11.950 --> 02:47:11.960 align:start position:0%
licensing do do you do this uh in a
 
02:47:16.710 --> 02:47:16.720 align:start position:0%
combination of scheduled and reactive to
 
02:47:21.429 --> 02:47:21.439 align:start position:0%
where you have a a plan to go out to to
 
02:47:25.630 --> 02:47:25.640 align:start position:0%
look at them plus you respond to
 
02:47:29.790 --> 02:47:29.800 align:start position:0%
complaints yes so we have uh every their
 
02:47:31.990 --> 02:47:32.000 align:start position:0%
license is good for every three years uh
 
02:47:35.990 --> 02:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
so they receive a a renewal inspection
 
02:47:38.030 --> 02:47:38.040 align:start position:0%
once every three years they receive an
 
02:47:40.790 --> 02:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
annual monitoring visit and that is
 
02:47:42.870 --> 02:47:42.880 align:start position:0%
unannounced it's something that they
 
02:47:46.110 --> 02:47:46.120 align:start position:0%
would uh we would go out and and see how
 
02:47:48.550 --> 02:47:48.560 align:start position:0%
they're doing with compliance um and
 
02:47:51.510 --> 02:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
then we would also go out if we received
 
02:47:51.520 --> 02:47:53.630 align:start position:0%
then we would also go out if we received
a

02:47:53.630 --> 02:47:53.640 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:47:56.309 --> 02:47:56.319 align:start position:0%
complaint and then as a former privacy
 
02:47:58.389 --> 02:47:58.399 align:start position:0%

DCF cases but um could be other matters
 
02:51:12.279 --> 02:51:13.309 align:start position:0%
DCF cases but um could be other matters
as

02:51:13.309 --> 02:51:13.319 align:start position:0%
as
 
02:51:18.710 --> 02:51:18.720 align:start position:0%
well yes repres so so who does who does
 
02:51:21.030 --> 02:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
legal report up through on the way to
 
02:51:21.040 --> 02:51:23.389 align:start position:0%
legal report up through on the way to
the

02:51:23.389 --> 02:51:23.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:26.550 --> 02:51:26.560 align:start position:0%
commissioner so so the legal Bureau the
 
02:51:29.190 --> 02:51:29.200 align:start position:0%
legal Bureau is under my oversight and
 
02:51:31.269 --> 02:51:31.279 align:start position:0%
then I report directly to the
 
02:51:34.229 --> 02:51:34.239 align:start position:0%
commissioner okay and then these seven
 
02:51:39.910 --> 02:51:39.920 align:start position:0%
systems cases as earlier today uh Miss
 
02:51:42.630 --> 02:51:42.640 align:start position:0%
Weaver was talking about TR
 
02:51:45.790 --> 02:51:45.800 align:start position:0%
transformation and visioning and stuff
 
02:51:49.510 --> 02:51:49.520 align:start position:0%
uh do you do you think that she looks at
 
02:51:53.429 --> 02:51:53.439 align:start position:0%
these systems cases to help inform what
 
02:51:56.229 --> 02:51:56.239 align:start position:0%
may need to be improved absolutely
 
02:51:58.110 --> 02:51:58.120 align:start position:0%
absolutely we've take into account
 
02:52:00.349 --> 02:52:00.359 align:start position:0%
anytime that we get any litigate
 
02:52:03.790 --> 02:52:03.800 align:start position:0%
litigation U matter we always review the
 
02:52:05.389 --> 02:52:05.399 align:start position:0%
matter see if there is something that
 
02:52:07.950 --> 02:52:07.960 align:start position:0%
the department um needs to you know
 
02:52:10.710 --> 02:52:10.720 align:start position:0%
improve upon if there's some some reason
 
02:52:15.110 --> 02:52:15.120 align:start position:0%
why um we think that that they may have
 
02:52:17.910 --> 02:52:17.920 align:start position:0%
gone to litigation and then we audit
 
02:52:21.070 --> 02:52:21.080 align:start position:0%
that we analyze the problem um and we
 
02:52:23.190 --> 02:52:23.200 align:start position:0%
and we incorporate any kind of solutions
 
02:52:25.670 --> 02:52:25.680 align:start position:0%
into our in our plans going forward
 
02:52:28.110 --> 02:52:28.120 align:start position:0%
absolutely that's absolutely a great
 
02:52:32.469 --> 02:52:32.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:35.670 --> 02:52:35.680 align:start position:0%
you so our major challenges similar to
 
02:52:38.830 --> 02:52:38.840 align:start position:0%
everyone else was obviously covid um a
 
02:52:41.269 --> 02:52:41.279 align:start position:0%
large amount of staff turnover we had we
 
02:52:43.110 --> 02:52:43.120 align:start position:0%
had a lot of individuals in both our
 
02:52:46.110 --> 02:52:46.120 align:start position:0%
legal Bureau and our um and our Bureau
 
02:52:47.550 --> 02:52:47.560 align:start position:0%
of Licensing and certification who were
 
02:52:51.750 --> 02:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
close to retirement and Co um So Co
 
02:52:54.150 --> 02:52:54.160 align:start position:0%
facilitated that retirement so we ended
 
02:52:56.870 --> 02:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
up having more than than expected with
 
02:52:59.349 --> 02:52:59.359 align:start position:0%
the hiring free it took a long time to
 
02:53:01.309 --> 02:53:01.319 align:start position:0%
get people on boarded um for our health
 
02:53:04.030 --> 02:53:04.040 align:start position:0%
facilities specifically we had seven
 
02:53:06.990 --> 02:53:07.000 align:start position:0%
individuals leave and it takes about six
 
02:53:09.670 --> 02:53:09.680 align:start position:0%
to nine months for our folks to become
 
02:53:12.710 --> 02:53:12.720 align:start position:0%
CMS trained in our certification team
 
02:53:16.309 --> 02:53:16.319 align:start position:0%
and because of that uh we still have a
 
02:53:18.110 --> 02:53:18.120 align:start position:0%
limited number of individuals who can
 
02:53:20.750 --> 02:53:20.760 align:start position:0%
who can conduct inspections because they
 
02:53:22.510 --> 02:53:22.520 align:start position:0%
they these other seven individuals are
 
02:53:24.910 --> 02:53:24.920 align:start position:0%
still in training so that has led to
 
02:53:26.990 --> 02:53:27.000 align:start position:0%
some significant stress on our current
 
02:53:29.150 --> 02:53:29.160 align:start position:0%
staff um obviously that and the fact
 
02:53:31.389 --> 02:53:31.399 align:start position:0%
that they're going out and inspecting
 
02:53:33.389 --> 02:53:33.399 align:start position:0%
facilities that they're required to go
 
02:53:36.510 --> 02:53:36.520 align:start position:0%
into covid positive facilities every day
 
02:53:38.750 --> 02:53:38.760 align:start position:0%
um you know obviously that's a stress So
 
02:53:42.110 --> 02:53:42.120 align:start position:0%
Co has has certainly um has certainly
 
02:53:43.510 --> 02:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
led to some additional stress that
 
02:53:45.990 --> 02:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
wasn't wasn't there previously and then
 
02:53:48.710 --> 02:53:48.720 align:start position:0%
our legal Bureau has been down as well
 
02:53:51.070 --> 02:53:51.080 align:start position:0%
they they were running for most of Co
 
02:53:52.630 --> 02:53:52.640 align:start position:0%
around General Council was running about
 
02:53:56.110 --> 02:53:56.120 align:start position:0%
50% capacity so it was a difficult time
 
02:53:58.229 --> 02:53:58.239 align:start position:0%
and and there's a lot of work to be done
 
02:54:00.150 --> 02:54:00.160 align:start position:0%
so I would say that that's one of their
 
02:54:01.269 --> 02:54:01.279 align:start position:0%
the biggest
 
02:54:03.429 --> 02:54:03.439 align:start position:0%
stressors the administrative Appeals
 
02:54:05.790 --> 02:54:05.800 align:start position:0%
Unit um our biggest concern and
 
02:54:09.469 --> 02:54:09.479 align:start position:0%
challenge is equipment um with our our
 
02:54:13.349 --> 02:54:13.359 align:start position:0%
appeals a lot of times they were done in
 
02:54:16.190 --> 02:54:16.200 align:start position:0%
person at uh our main building and our
 
02:54:18.870 --> 02:54:18.880 align:start position:0%
in in their office but now that clients
 
02:54:20.830 --> 02:54:20.840 align:start position:0%
and everyone you know they certainly
 
02:54:22.309 --> 02:54:22.319 align:start position:0%
don't want to come face to face we've
 
02:54:25.550 --> 02:54:25.560 align:start position:0%
had to change our systems and have a lot
 
02:54:27.550 --> 02:54:27.560 align:start position:0%
of things doing by doing video
 
02:54:29.309 --> 02:54:29.319 align:start position:0%
conferencing a lot of changes to our
 
02:54:30.990 --> 02:54:31.000 align:start position:0%
system and our equipment just isn't
 
02:54:34.190 --> 02:54:34.200 align:start position:0%
isn't um Avail the equipment isn't up
 
02:54:36.990 --> 02:54:37.000 align:start position:0%
toar to be able to accomplish all of
 
02:54:38.309 --> 02:54:38.319 align:start position:0%
what needs to be accomplished with the
 
02:54:40.630 --> 02:54:40.640 align:start position:0%
administrative Appeals Unit and then
 
02:54:44.590 --> 02:54:44.600 align:start position:0%
legal our biggest concern uh overall is
 
02:54:46.950 --> 02:54:46.960 align:start position:0%
is litigation cost and Personnel resour
 
02:54:49.229 --> 02:54:49.239 align:start position:0%
Resources for discovery our litigation
 
02:54:52.349 --> 02:54:52.359 align:start position:0%
hold um that creates a a huge burden on
 
02:54:53.750 --> 02:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
the legal unit and the costs of the
 
02:54:55.349 --> 02:54:55.359 align:start position:0%
department for the considerable time and
 
02:54:58.070 --> 02:54:58.080 align:start position:0%
money that we have to spend on um
 
02:54:59.590 --> 02:54:59.600 align:start position:0%
Discovery and litigation holds for the
 
02:55:02.990 --> 02:55:03.000 align:start position:0%
for our um just toine litigation
 
02:55:11.070 --> 02:55:11.080 align:start position:0%
hold so when a when um a matter is uh so
 
02:55:14.870 --> 02:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
one of the current DC matters we receive
 
02:55:17.990 --> 02:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh notice that they're that the they
 
02:55:19.550 --> 02:55:19.560 align:start position:0%
going there's going to be a pending
 
02:55:22.790 --> 02:55:22.800 align:start position:0%
lawsuit we're required to put
 
02:55:27.590 --> 02:55:27.600 align:start position:0%
our all of our documents emails um
 
02:55:29.429 --> 02:55:29.439 align:start position:0%
basically anything on hold so nothing
 
02:55:32.229 --> 02:55:32.239 align:start position:0%
can be deleted uh and it all goes into
 
02:55:34.990 --> 02:55:35.000 align:start position:0%
kind of like a cash a Bank where it sits
 
02:55:38.429 --> 02:55:38.439 align:start position:0%
and just stays there uh to to then be
 
02:55:40.190 --> 02:55:40.200 align:start position:0%
available for discovery for when the
 
02:55:41.990 --> 02:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
litigation moves for forward when the
 
02:55:44.550 --> 02:55:44.560 align:start position:0%
matter moves forward and so that's a
 
02:55:47.190 --> 02:55:47.200 align:start position:0%
that's a very costly thing uh because we
 
02:55:50.269 --> 02:55:50.279 align:start position:0%
need to obtain license es to be able to
 
02:55:52.910 --> 02:55:52.920 align:start position:0%
get individuals on litigation H so that
 
02:55:54.550 --> 02:55:54.560 align:start position:0%
their documents won't be destroyed
 
02:55:57.510 --> 02:55:57.520 align:start position:0%
during the you know the pending matter
 
02:56:00.830 --> 02:56:00.840 align:start position:0%
um until the until the suit is finalized
 
02:56:02.870 --> 02:56:02.880 align:start position:0%
and so that's that's quite costly at
 
02:56:04.469 --> 02:56:04.479 align:start position:0%
this point and we can certainly get you
 
02:56:09.269 --> 02:56:09.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:13.269 --> 02:56:13.279 align:start position:0%
them this is just a percentage of our Uh
 
02:56:14.790 --> 02:56:14.800 align:start position:0%
current Staffing for legal and
 
02:56:16.510 --> 02:56:16.520 align:start position:0%
Regulatory Services I know you've seen
 
02:56:19.269 --> 02:56:19.279 align:start position:0%
the slide other in other places is and
 
02:56:22.469 --> 02:56:22.479 align:start position:0%
then the remaining are our pie charts
 
02:56:26.110 --> 02:56:26.120 align:start position:0%
which um Beth Kelly is the finance
 
02:56:27.990 --> 02:56:28.000 align:start position:0%
person is on the line if you have any
 
02:56:31.070 --> 02:56:31.080 align:start position:0%
questions around these pie
 
02:56:36.469 --> 02:56:36.479 align:start position:0%
charts so you had um over 150 people on
 
02:56:38.710 --> 02:56:38.720 align:start position:0%
the prior slide I'm just curious how
 
02:56:42.349 --> 02:56:42.359 align:start position:0%
many of those are have to be attorneys
 
02:56:46.550 --> 02:56:46.560 align:start position:0%
and and and do you need bar um those who
 
02:56:48.429 --> 02:56:48.439 align:start position:0%
pass the bar must they pass the bar far
 
02:56:50.950 --> 02:56:50.960 align:start position:0%
to work for the
 
02:56:53.790 --> 02:56:53.800 align:start position:0%
department so our administrative Appeals
 
02:56:57.710 --> 02:56:57.720 align:start position:0%
Unit and our um General Council and
 
02:57:00.550 --> 02:57:00.560 align:start position:0%
anyone who goes to court all have to
 
02:57:02.910 --> 02:57:02.920 align:start position:0%
have be barred within the state of New
 
02:57:06.030 --> 02:57:06.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so that's most of most of the
 
02:57:08.710 --> 02:57:08.720 align:start position:0%
individuals there are some uh obviously
 
02:57:11.030 --> 02:57:11.040 align:start position:0%
legal services that are paral legals um
 
02:57:14.429 --> 02:57:14.439 align:start position:0%
that are you know clerks and other types
 
02:57:17.510 --> 02:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
of positions within that help the S the
 
02:57:20.309 --> 02:57:20.319 align:start position:0%
units such is child support and and
 
02:57:22.830 --> 02:57:22.840 align:start position:0%
DCF um but I would say a majority of
 
02:57:27.950 --> 02:57:27.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:30.830 --> 02:57:30.840 align:start position:0%
barred and that so these are all pie
 
02:57:33.950 --> 02:57:33.960 align:start position:0%
charts um comparisons and then these uh
 
02:57:36.910 --> 02:57:36.920 align:start position:0%
the the overview of the pages and budget
 
02:57:39.070 --> 02:57:39.080 align:start position:0%
books so other than that that is the end
 
02:57:40.870 --> 02:57:40.880 align:start position:0%
of my presentation if you have any other
 
02:57:41.950 --> 02:57:41.960 align:start position:0%
questions for
 
02:57:47.110 --> 02:57:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:50.550 --> 02:57:50.560 align:start position:0%
anyone so I I think what we'd like to do
 
02:57:55.269 --> 02:57:55.279 align:start position:0%
next is um to go ahead and and all those
 
02:57:57.630 --> 02:57:57.640 align:start position:0%
accounts that you've got listed there if
 
02:57:59.550 --> 02:57:59.560 align:start position:0%
we could start getting into the
 
02:58:01.349 --> 02:58:01.359 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet view of those so we're going
 
02:58:02.950 --> 02:58:02.960 align:start position:0%
out of we're going in a slightly
 
02:58:05.790 --> 02:58:05.800 align:start position:0%
different order and I don't know if you
 
02:58:09.830 --> 02:58:09.840 align:start position:0%
need to remain for this um Miss Saint
 
02:58:13.710 --> 02:58:13.720 align:start position:0%
sier or if Karen's gonna do it or okay
 
02:58:17.910 --> 02:58:17.920 align:start position:0%
no she she definitely gets to stay um so
 
02:58:19.830 --> 02:58:19.840 align:start position:0%
uh I did bring up on the screen the
 
02:58:22.910 --> 02:58:22.920 align:start position:0%
chart that I did send over yesterday
 
02:58:24.590 --> 02:58:24.600 align:start position:0%
that has all the accounting units for
 
02:58:26.910 --> 02:58:26.920 align:start position:0%
oom and I figured I'd just walk through
 
02:58:28.710 --> 02:58:28.720 align:start position:0%
quickly what the highlights are and then
 
02:58:30.510 --> 02:58:30.520 align:start position:0%
we'll jump right into the legal
 
02:58:32.830 --> 02:58:32.840 align:start position:0%
accounting units if that works for you
 
02:58:34.990 --> 02:58:35.000 align:start position:0%
chair does thank
 
02:58:37.229 --> 02:58:37.239 align:start position:0%
you great so the ones that we're going
 
02:58:40.110 --> 02:58:40.120 align:start position:0%
to cover that are related to Melissa St
 
02:58:42.590 --> 02:58:42.600 align:start position:0%
Sierra's area the legal accounting units
 
02:58:44.990 --> 02:58:45.000 align:start position:0%
start at accounting unit
 
02:58:47.630 --> 02:58:47.640 align:start position:0%
5143 so the page you want to turn to in
 
02:58:51.030 --> 02:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:53.710 --> 02:58:53.720 align:start position:0%
1,170 and we will cover all of the ones
 
02:58:55.590 --> 02:58:55.600 align:start position:0%
highlighted in yellow right through to
 
02:59:02.150 --> 02:59:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:04.349 --> 02:59:04.359 align:start position:0%
budsman so I'm going to jump over and
 
02:59:05.950 --> 02:59:05.960 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll give everyone a second if
 
02:59:08.429 --> 02:59:08.439 align:start position:0%
that's okay just to yeah yeah do give us
 
02:59:10.830 --> 02:59:10.840 align:start position:0%
a second because I'm I'm using the
 
02:59:14.830 --> 02:59:14.840 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet um instead of the book uh
 
02:59:18.870 --> 02:59:18.880 align:start position:0%
and I've not become faile at finding
 
02:59:18.880 --> 02:59:19.990 align:start position:0%
and I've not become faile at finding
stuff

02:59:19.990 --> 02:59:20.000 align:start position:0%
stuff
 
02:59:23.830 --> 02:59:23.840 align:start position:0%
yet so 5143 is called child care
 
02:59:27.550 --> 02:59:27.560 align:start position:0%
licensing right yes sir all right Kevin
 
02:59:31.469 --> 02:59:31.479 align:start position:0%
is Beth Kelly um brought
 
02:59:38.790 --> 02:59:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:41.670 --> 02:59:41.680 align:start position:0%
check she is a panelist she's currently
 
02:59:49.070 --> 02:59:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:52.030 --> 02:59:52.040 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry great
 
02:59:55.190 --> 02:59:55.200 align:start position:0%
okay so I'm gonna um I'm going to lead
 
02:59:58.229 --> 02:59:58.239 align:start position:0%
us but quite frankly Beth um and Melissa
 
03:00:00.030 --> 03:00:00.040 align:start position:0%
probably are going to be the ones
 
03:00:01.710 --> 03:00:01.720 align:start position:0%
talking a lot more than I am because
 
03:00:03.309 --> 03:00:03.319 align:start position:0%
Beth is the one that prepares these
 
03:00:06.110 --> 03:00:06.120 align:start position:0%
budgets and works with Melissa on them
 
03:00:08.269 --> 03:00:08.279 align:start position:0%
um so the first one is child care
 
03:00:10.510 --> 03:00:10.520 align:start position:0%
licensing which Melissa walked through
 
03:00:12.510 --> 03:00:12.520 align:start position:0%
what child care licensing
 
03:00:17.030 --> 03:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
is um just to set things up uh of course
 
03:00:21.710 --> 03:00:21.720 align:start position:0%
the expenditure are are listed here um
 
03:00:24.830 --> 03:00:24.840 align:start position:0%
through to a total and then the amount
 
03:00:28.510 --> 03:00:28.520 align:start position:0%
of Revenue is then listed down here and
 
03:00:29.950 --> 03:00:29.960 align:start position:0%
the number of positions in this
 
03:00:32.389 --> 03:00:32.399 align:start position:0%
accounting unit is at the bottom there
 
03:00:34.110 --> 03:00:34.120 align:start position:0%
we are fortunate in that this accounting
 
03:00:36.670 --> 03:00:36.680 align:start position:0%
unit is actually all on one page in many
 
03:00:38.550 --> 03:00:38.560 align:start position:0%
cases accounting units are split between
 
03:00:40.950 --> 03:00:40.960 align:start position:0%
Pages um in the budget book but
 
03:00:42.710 --> 03:00:42.720 align:start position:0%
fortunately we started out with one that
 
03:00:45.710 --> 03:00:45.720 align:start position:0%
makes it nice and easy all on one page
 
03:00:48.469 --> 03:00:48.479 align:start position:0%
um so chair I'm not sure how you want to
 
03:00:51.910 --> 03:00:51.920 align:start position:0%
go you can is there any way you can um
 
03:00:54.229 --> 03:00:54.239 align:start position:0%
enlarge that a little bit my my eyes are
 
03:00:56.190 --> 03:00:56.200 align:start position:0%
not quite good that's wonderful thank
 
03:00:59.469 --> 03:00:59.479 align:start position:0%
you okay you're welcome um so chair I'm
 
03:01:02.510 --> 03:01:02.520 align:start position:0%
not sure how you want to proceed if you
 
03:01:04.349 --> 03:01:04.359 align:start position:0%
want to give everyone a few minutes to
 
03:01:07.670 --> 03:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
look at it and then we'll take questions
 
03:01:10.110 --> 03:01:10.120 align:start position:0%
um what makes the most sense for you
 
03:01:12.750 --> 03:01:12.760 align:start position:0%
well okay so the reason I use the Excel
 
03:01:14.349 --> 03:01:14.359 align:start position:0%
is because I just do a quick little
 
03:01:17.269 --> 03:01:17.279 align:start position:0%
formula to see how much accounts are
 
03:01:18.510 --> 03:01:18.520 align:start position:0%
going up
 
03:01:21.469 --> 03:01:21.479 align:start position:0%
and I I I noticed in this one that the
 
03:01:23.630 --> 03:01:23.640 align:start position:0%
general fund is going up
 
03:01:27.670 --> 03:01:27.680 align:start position:0%
51% or about
 
03:01:30.269 --> 03:01:30.279 align:start position:0%
$290,000 yes and I'm just looking for
 
03:01:34.510 --> 03:01:34.520 align:start position:0%
the short story of of why sure so you're
 
03:01:36.190 --> 03:01:36.200 align:start position:0%
actually going to see this in a lot of
 
03:01:39.030 --> 03:01:39.040 align:start position:0%
the legal accounting units um one of the
 
03:01:41.870 --> 03:01:41.880 align:start position:0%
things that we in changing how we
 
03:01:44.269 --> 03:01:44.279 align:start position:0%
budgeted we realize that we have been
 
03:01:47.349 --> 03:01:47.359 align:start position:0%
under budgeting General funds in the
 
03:01:50.910 --> 03:01:50.920 align:start position:0%
legal area um because of cost allocation
 
03:01:53.150 --> 03:01:53.160 align:start position:0%
so fortunate fortunately from an
 
03:01:54.670 --> 03:01:54.680 align:start position:0%
accounting perspective not from an
 
03:01:56.950 --> 03:01:56.960 align:start position:0%
operations perspective because there
 
03:01:59.590 --> 03:01:59.600 align:start position:0%
have been vacancies there hasn't been a
 
03:02:01.790 --> 03:02:01.800 align:start position:0%
shortfall of General funds in these
 
03:02:03.670 --> 03:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
accounting units but we are now trying
 
03:02:07.349 --> 03:02:07.359 align:start position:0%
to budget them um as they will be earned
 
03:02:08.870 --> 03:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
which is a higher general fund
 
03:02:11.269 --> 03:02:11.279 align:start position:0%
percentage due to that cost allocation
 
03:02:13.510 --> 03:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
which is the Fally required system that
 
03:02:18.070 --> 03:02:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:21.070 --> 03:02:21.080 align:start position:0%
you succeeded in confusing
 
03:02:25.630 --> 03:02:25.640 align:start position:0%
me um so so Mr Ripple you want to
 
03:02:28.469 --> 03:02:28.479 align:start position:0%
translate that since you since you know
 
03:02:30.750 --> 03:02:30.760 align:start position:0%
my limitations what what what did we
 
03:02:33.389 --> 03:02:33.399 align:start position:0%
just say about why General funds are
 
03:02:37.469 --> 03:02:37.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:41.269 --> 03:02:41.279 align:start position:0%
51% you're muted sir I am muted there we
 
03:02:43.790 --> 03:02:43.800 align:start position:0%
go um I'm not entirely sure how to
 
03:02:46.830 --> 03:02:46.840 align:start position:0%
rephrase it sounds like um I have the
 
03:02:48.190 --> 03:02:48.200 align:start position:0%
feeling I'm just going to be back the
 
03:02:50.389 --> 03:02:50.399 align:start position:0%
same words Karen just said all over
 
03:02:53.190 --> 03:02:53.200 align:start position:0%
again because I wasn't aware of this
 
03:02:56.229 --> 03:02:56.239 align:start position:0%
issue prior to now is there is there
 
03:02:59.510 --> 03:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
some feedback here yeah Beth Beth you
 
03:03:01.990 --> 03:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
probably have to mute her computer tends
 
03:03:06.950 --> 03:03:06.960 align:start position:0%
to get feedback oh right okay um I just
 
03:03:09.349 --> 03:03:09.359 align:start position:0%
muted her there um so no I wasn't aware
 
03:03:11.349 --> 03:03:11.359 align:start position:0%
of this issue prior to now but it sounds
 
03:03:14.750 --> 03:03:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:17.389 --> 03:03:17.399 align:start position:0%
um due to the way positions are are
 
03:03:19.190 --> 03:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
funded it's a cost allocation issue
 
03:03:21.870 --> 03:03:21.880 align:start position:0%
Karen mainly with positions am I am I
 
03:03:24.229 --> 03:03:24.239 align:start position:0%
understanding that correctly yes and it
 
03:03:26.110 --> 03:03:26.120 align:start position:0%
would relate to benefits and their
 
03:03:27.990 --> 03:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
training because the cost allocation
 
03:03:30.469 --> 03:03:30.479 align:start position:0%
would apply to to all of their
 
03:03:33.070 --> 03:03:33.080 align:start position:0%
expenditures okay
 
03:03:36.429 --> 03:03:36.439 align:start position:0%
so in 2021 and earlier this was not
 
03:03:38.469 --> 03:03:38.479 align:start position:0%
budgeted correctly your in your view and
 
03:03:40.429 --> 03:03:40.439 align:start position:0%
now it is budgeted correctly that's
 
03:03:42.670 --> 03:03:42.680 align:start position:0%
correct yes so I don't know the details
 
03:03:44.469 --> 03:03:44.479 align:start position:0%
of that I think it's something um if you
 
03:03:45.510 --> 03:03:45.520 align:start position:0%
want to look at this further
 
03:03:47.150 --> 03:03:47.160 align:start position:0%
representative we'd have to I'd have to
 
03:03:51.150 --> 03:03:51.160 align:start position:0%
get further information on it he no let
 
03:03:53.309 --> 03:03:53.319 align:start position:0%
me just ask a simple question then if
 
03:03:55.990 --> 03:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
we're plusy up this account is there an
 
03:03:57.469 --> 03:03:57.479 align:start position:0%
account somewhere else that we're
 
03:04:00.469 --> 03:04:00.479 align:start position:0%
decrementing so that on net it's the
 
03:04:05.910 --> 03:04:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:13.070 --> 03:04:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:15.990 --> 03:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily so by that you mean that
 
03:04:18.790 --> 03:04:18.800 align:start position:0%
there is no redu uction somewhere else
 
03:04:22.870 --> 03:04:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:26.429 --> 03:04:26.439 align:start position:0%
this well our total our total budget is
 
03:04:30.950 --> 03:04:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:34.030 --> 03:04:34.040 align:start position:0%
21 now whether this is part of that
 
03:04:35.870 --> 03:04:35.880 align:start position:0%
increase I I guess you could consider
 
03:04:37.469 --> 03:04:37.479 align:start position:0%
that but there are certainly other areas
 
03:04:39.229 --> 03:04:39.239 align:start position:0%
of the budget that have decreases in
 
03:04:39.239 --> 03:04:40.150 align:start position:0%
of the budget that have decreases in
general

03:04:40.150 --> 03:04:40.160 align:start position:0%
general
 
03:04:42.510 --> 03:04:42.520 align:start position:0%
funds but we don't look at it as like a
 
03:04:45.870 --> 03:04:45.880 align:start position:0%
one for one like you know just because I
 
03:04:49.469 --> 03:04:49.479 align:start position:0%
increased it here $200,000 doesn't mean
 
03:04:51.229 --> 03:04:51.239 align:start position:0%
I looked to another area and said okay
 
03:04:54.070 --> 03:04:54.080 align:start position:0%
now you need to decrease 200,000 we try
 
03:04:55.830 --> 03:04:55.840 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we budget correctly
 
03:04:57.630 --> 03:04:57.640 align:start position:0%
everywhere and then if we need to make
 
03:05:01.590 --> 03:05:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:03.790 --> 03:05:03.800 align:start position:0%
globally and I also just want to point
 
03:05:07.469 --> 03:05:07.479 align:start position:0%
out um quickly that we did also take on
 
03:05:10.110 --> 03:05:10.120 align:start position:0%
camp licensing which was not in the
 
03:05:13.269 --> 03:05:13.279 align:start position:0%
budget previously for 20 uh for 19 and
 
03:05:17.790 --> 03:05:17.800 align:start position:0%
20 or 21 22 2021 excuse me so that is an
 
03:05:19.150 --> 03:05:19.160 align:start position:0%
additional expense that childcare
 
03:05:21.309 --> 03:05:21.319 align:start position:0%
licensing did not have prior to that
 
03:05:22.309 --> 03:05:22.319 align:start position:0%
they do
 
03:05:24.750 --> 03:05:24.760 align:start position:0%
now presentive walner do you have your
 
03:05:24.760 --> 03:05:26.670 align:start position:0%
now presentive walner do you have your
hand

03:05:26.670 --> 03:05:26.680 align:start position:0%
hand
 
03:05:32.070 --> 03:05:32.080 align:start position:0%
up thank yes I do thank you um Karen I
 
03:05:36.469 --> 03:05:36.479 align:start position:0%
wondered what other requirements around
 
03:05:39.469 --> 03:05:39.479 align:start position:0%
um how much General funds do we do we
 
03:05:41.510 --> 03:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
need to match the federal is there a
 
03:05:43.630 --> 03:05:43.640 align:start position:0%
matching requirement or a maintenance of
 
03:05:43.640 --> 03:05:44.710 align:start position:0%
matching requirement or a maintenance of
effort

03:05:44.710 --> 03:05:44.720 align:start position:0%
effort
 
03:05:48.630 --> 03:05:48.640 align:start position:0%
requirement on these lines
 
03:05:50.990 --> 03:05:51.000 align:start position:0%
there likely is I could ask Beth to jump
 
03:05:53.910 --> 03:05:53.920 align:start position:0%
in but yes I I think what you're
 
03:05:55.990 --> 03:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
referring to is part part of how child
 
03:05:59.710 --> 03:05:59.720 align:start position:0%
care licensing is paid for is with um
 
03:06:01.910 --> 03:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
federal child care development funds
 
03:06:05.590 --> 03:06:05.600 align:start position:0%
ccdf funds and so that is part of the
 
03:06:06.870 --> 03:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
federal funds that are in this
 
03:06:08.349 --> 03:06:08.359 align:start position:0%
accounting unit and that does have a
 
03:06:11.990 --> 03:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
general fund matching requirement
 
03:06:14.190 --> 03:06:14.200 align:start position:0%
ore Beth is there anything you want to
 
03:06:24.309 --> 03:06:24.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:25.910 --> 03:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
be you're on mute
 
03:06:31.389 --> 03:06:31.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:35.510 --> 03:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
thanks so um so I would like to
 
03:06:36.870 --> 03:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
understand this deeper but I don't want
 
03:06:40.389 --> 03:06:40.399 align:start position:0%
to take more hearing time right now um
 
03:06:45.510 --> 03:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
just just because of I I I I I think I
 
03:06:49.870 --> 03:06:49.880 align:start position:0%
understand that we've had to pay people
 
03:06:54.190 --> 03:06:54.200 align:start position:0%
previously but the we budgeted wrong so
 
03:06:57.429 --> 03:06:57.439 align:start position:0%
it got fixed in a cost allocation effort
 
03:06:59.990 --> 03:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
to move money from where we had it to
 
03:07:02.269 --> 03:07:02.279 align:start position:0%
where we needed it and now we're just
 
03:07:04.830 --> 03:07:04.840 align:start position:0%
trying to improve our budgeting but it
 
03:07:07.190 --> 03:07:07.200 align:start position:0%
seems to me at the end of the day we're
 
03:07:09.870 --> 03:07:09.880 align:start position:0%
still should be spending about the same
 
03:07:12.710 --> 03:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
amount of money because in this example
 
03:07:15.190 --> 03:07:15.200 align:start position:0%
there are 19 FTE in the permanent
 
03:07:18.389 --> 03:07:18.399 align:start position:0%
classified throughout the period
 
03:07:21.550 --> 03:07:21.560 align:start position:0%
um so so we're not actually increasing
 
03:07:24.710 --> 03:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
the actual cost from a Personnel
 
03:07:26.950 --> 03:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
perspective to this
 
03:07:29.630 --> 03:07:29.640 align:start position:0%
department correct the total cost to
 
03:07:32.590 --> 03:07:32.600 align:start position:0%
this area is is very similar it only
 
03:07:34.630 --> 03:07:34.640 align:start position:0%
went up about
 
03:07:37.910 --> 03:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
$40,000 um which if you look at the
 
03:07:40.389 --> 03:07:40.399 align:start position:0%
benefits line that went up $70,000 so we
 
03:07:42.110 --> 03:07:42.120 align:start position:0%
did make other reductions so that the
 
03:07:46.229 --> 03:07:46.239 align:start position:0%
total budget um was more in line with
 
03:07:49.429 --> 03:07:49.439 align:start position:0%
the previous year but the fund mix if
 
03:07:51.590 --> 03:07:51.600 align:start position:0%
you will changed because of cost
 
03:07:54.389 --> 03:07:54.399 align:start position:0%
allocation changes so do you mean a
 
03:07:56.309 --> 03:07:56.319 align:start position:0%
different benefits line or the one
 
03:08:00.910 --> 03:08:00.920 align:start position:0%
that's that's uh at 714 480 and the
 
03:08:03.229 --> 03:08:03.239 align:start position:0%
governor's recommended yes is that the
 
03:08:07.469 --> 03:08:07.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:09.590 --> 03:08:09.600 align:start position:0%
that's sorry go
 
03:08:14.110 --> 03:08:14.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:16.630 --> 03:08:16.640 align:start position:0%
ahead I'm learning when you're talking
 
03:08:16.640 --> 03:08:18.030 align:start position:0%
ahead I'm learning when you're talking
so

03:08:18.030 --> 03:08:18.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:08:21.429 --> 03:08:21.439 align:start position:0%
you talk okay yes the benefits line for
 
03:08:23.590 --> 03:08:23.600 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 22 was is
 
03:08:26.950 --> 03:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
677000 and for 23 is
 
03:08:29.590 --> 03:08:29.600 align:start position:0%
74,000 those numbers are set by
 
03:08:31.389 --> 03:08:31.399 align:start position:0%
Department of administrative Services
 
03:08:34.910 --> 03:08:34.920 align:start position:0%
the same is true of Class 10 I think um
 
03:08:36.030 --> 03:08:36.040 align:start position:0%
the reason that you're seeing a
 
03:08:39.830 --> 03:08:39.840 align:start position:0%
reduction in class 10 from 994 th000 to
 
03:08:43.550 --> 03:08:43.560 align:start position:0%
987 th000 uh and the same number of
 
03:08:45.309 --> 03:08:45.319 align:start position:0%
positions is what Melissa spoke to
 
03:08:47.269 --> 03:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
earlier that we had some retirements in
 
03:08:49.429 --> 03:08:49.439 align:start position:0%
the this area so the people that retired
 
03:08:51.750 --> 03:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
probably were at the top of their pay
 
03:08:55.110 --> 03:08:55.120 align:start position:0%
scale so they were budgeted in 20 and 21
 
03:08:57.309 --> 03:08:57.319 align:start position:0%
at the top of the pay scale when the
 
03:08:59.510 --> 03:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
position is vacant it is then budgeted
 
03:09:04.030 --> 03:09:04.040 align:start position:0%
at the um lowest level of the pay
 
03:09:07.190 --> 03:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
scale so so just to be clear I'm really
 
03:09:10.630 --> 03:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
concerned at the resourcing level not
 
03:09:13.429 --> 03:09:13.439 align:start position:0%
the accounting level and and I think I
 
03:09:15.870 --> 03:09:15.880 align:start position:0%
just asked you a bunch of questions that
 
03:09:18.309 --> 03:09:18.319 align:start position:0%
drove you into accounting instead of
 
03:09:20.670 --> 03:09:20.680 align:start position:0%
resourcing okay you know the distinction
 
03:09:23.950 --> 03:09:23.960 align:start position:0%
I I didn't really mean to do that okay
 
03:09:26.830 --> 03:09:26.840 align:start position:0%
so let let's go on to the next uh
 
03:09:28.870 --> 03:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
Department unless are there any
 
03:09:32.349 --> 03:09:32.359 align:start position:0%
questions on child care licensing
 
03:09:37.510 --> 03:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:40.510 --> 03:09:40.520 align:start position:0%
section all
 
03:09:42.750 --> 03:09:42.760 align:start position:0%
right which section do you want to talk
 
03:09:45.510 --> 03:09:45.520 align:start position:0%
about next so the next accounting unit
 
03:09:47.870 --> 03:09:47.880 align:start position:0%
would be 5146
 
03:10:02.429 --> 03:10:02.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:07.790 --> 03:10:07.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:11.950 --> 03:10:11.960 align:start position:0%
okay all right I'm I'm I'm ready to hear
 
03:10:15.469 --> 03:10:15.479 align:start position:0%
you okay I'm I'm certainly open to any
 
03:10:17.790 --> 03:10:17.800 align:start position:0%
um questions that you might have on this
 
03:10:21.429 --> 03:10:21.439 align:start position:0%
area the general fund changes here are
 
03:10:25.229 --> 03:10:25.239 align:start position:0%
the same issue that we were just talking
 
03:10:28.030 --> 03:10:28.040 align:start position:0%
about okay in this case General funds go
 
03:10:28.040 --> 03:10:29.030 align:start position:0%
about okay in this case General funds go
up

03:10:29.030 --> 03:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
up
 
03:10:29.040 --> 03:10:30.630 align:start position:0%
up
73%

03:10:30.630 --> 03:10:30.640 align:start position:0%
73%
 
03:10:34.469 --> 03:10:34.479 align:start position:0%
yes and and like before there is no
 
03:10:38.510 --> 03:10:38.520 align:start position:0%
change in FTE correct and the overall
 
03:10:44.150 --> 03:10:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:47.429 --> 03:10:47.439 align:start position:0%
area because federal funds got backed
 
03:10:47.439 --> 03:10:48.910 align:start position:0%
area because federal funds got backed
out

03:10:48.910 --> 03:10:48.920 align:start position:0%
out
 
03:10:51.389 --> 03:10:51.399 align:start position:0%
correct so that's not good what's going
 
03:10:53.150 --> 03:10:53.160 align:start position:0%
on with the federal funds why did they
 
03:10:54.269 --> 03:10:54.279 align:start position:0%
drop at
 
03:10:56.990 --> 03:10:57.000 align:start position:0%
42% this this is the same issue that we
 
03:10:58.550 --> 03:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
were just talking about it's about the
 
03:11:02.510 --> 03:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
cost allocation so um the health
 
03:11:04.710 --> 03:11:04.720 align:start position:0%
facilities back our health facilities
 
03:11:09.429 --> 03:11:09.439 align:start position:0%
time trackers or are they something else
 
03:11:13.150 --> 03:11:13.160 align:start position:0%
Ken um we have a change request in for
 
03:11:17.910 --> 03:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
this accounting unit um it was key wrong
 
03:11:20.630 --> 03:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
downtown so that's it's affecting the
 
03:11:25.070 --> 03:11:25.080 align:start position:0%
federal and other funds okay the federal
 
03:11:28.110 --> 03:11:28.120 align:start position:0%
funds to after this after the change
 
03:11:30.870 --> 03:11:30.880 align:start position:0%
request is accepted or approved we
 
03:11:34.630 --> 03:11:34.640 align:start position:0%
expect this to look um more like 22 it
 
03:11:39.150 --> 03:11:39.160 align:start position:0%
was key R in 23 okay I see that it looks
 
03:11:41.429 --> 03:11:41.439 align:start position:0%
like it's missing a million dollars yeah
 
03:11:44.389 --> 03:11:44.399 align:start position:0%
yeah yep so representative walner has a
 
03:11:45.550 --> 03:11:45.560 align:start position:0%
question you're
 
03:11:48.590 --> 03:11:48.600 align:start position:0%
recognized thank you so I mean you just
 
03:11:51.309 --> 03:11:51.319 align:start position:0%
you just things things come back you
 
03:11:54.870 --> 03:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
know when you say certain words so um I
 
03:11:57.590 --> 03:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
know that often in our budgets we have
 
03:11:59.990 --> 03:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
had a lot of change
 
03:12:03.630 --> 03:12:03.640 align:start position:0%
requests and I guess what I'm wondering
 
03:12:06.110 --> 03:12:06.120 align:start position:0%
will we be getting a list of
 
03:12:10.710 --> 03:12:10.720 align:start position:0%
those um sometime in the near
 
03:12:14.389 --> 03:12:14.399 align:start position:0%
future yes so typically what I do is um
 
03:12:18.269 --> 03:12:18.279 align:start position:0%
I will put together uh in the house phas
 
03:12:20.750 --> 03:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
last time we had probably 20ish does
 
03:12:23.110 --> 03:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
that sound right Kevin of things that we
 
03:12:26.429 --> 03:12:26.439 align:start position:0%
needed to correct um I think at least
 
03:12:29.830 --> 03:12:29.840 align:start position:0%
yeah there were quite a few so I I will
 
03:12:32.030 --> 03:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
put together a preliminary list probably
 
03:12:34.550 --> 03:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
mid next week that will probably only be
 
03:12:37.710 --> 03:12:37.720 align:start position:0%
10 or 15 and then as we go through the
 
03:12:39.429 --> 03:12:39.439 align:start position:0%
session I will probably have another
 
03:12:42.389 --> 03:12:42.399 align:start position:0%
group um typically uh chair just for
 
03:12:45.670 --> 03:12:45.680 align:start position:0%
your information what we submit um they
 
03:12:47.790 --> 03:12:47.800 align:start position:0%
will have sort of two different tracks
 
03:12:50.070 --> 03:12:50.080 align:start position:0%
there will be the ones that we Net Zero
 
03:12:52.150 --> 03:12:52.160 align:start position:0%
so there's no impact to General funds
 
03:12:54.269 --> 03:12:54.279 align:start position:0%
and then there may be some that we say
 
03:12:56.670 --> 03:12:56.680 align:start position:0%
we made a budgeting mistake and there's
 
03:13:00.070 --> 03:13:00.080 align:start position:0%
a an issue with General funds um as far
 
03:13:03.510 --> 03:13:03.520 align:start position:0%
as requests for additional services or
 
03:13:06.469 --> 03:13:06.479 align:start position:0%
different programs or or anything like
 
03:13:07.910 --> 03:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
that those would all happen during the
 
03:13:10.229 --> 03:13:10.239 align:start position:0%
budget presentations so we only use
 
03:13:13.670 --> 03:13:13.680 align:start position:0%
change requests for budgeting mistakes
 
03:13:15.190 --> 03:13:15.200 align:start position:0%
we don't use them to try to make
 
03:13:22.510 --> 03:13:22.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:22.520 --> 03:13:24.309 align:start position:0%
 
know

03:13:24.309 --> 03:13:24.319 align:start position:0%
know
 
03:13:28.950 --> 03:13:28.960 align:start position:0%
so it looks to me like the the the
 
03:13:33.590 --> 03:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
benefits and fringe benefits account for
 
03:13:36.389 --> 03:13:36.399 align:start position:0%
the substantial part of any changes to
 
03:13:40.510 --> 03:13:40.520 align:start position:0%
this budget yes and both of those are um
 
03:13:41.750 --> 03:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
determined by the department of
 
03:13:43.590 --> 03:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
administrative Services we don't have
 
03:13:47.190 --> 03:13:47.200 align:start position:0%
control over those amounts
 
03:13:48.790 --> 03:13:48.800 align:start position:0%
so are there any questions from the
 
03:13:53.510 --> 03:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:56.469 --> 03:13:56.479 align:start position:0%
Administration Mr chair I I have I have
 
03:14:00.070 --> 03:14:00.080 align:start position:0%
one more question oh please ask just
 
03:14:01.990 --> 03:14:02.000 align:start position:0%
okay it's more of a general question
 
03:14:02.000 --> 03:14:04.110 align:start position:0%
okay it's more of a general question
again

03:14:04.110 --> 03:14:04.120 align:start position:0%
again
 
03:14:07.030 --> 03:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
um I guess as we since we are already
 
03:14:09.590 --> 03:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
starting through this uh looking at the
 
03:14:11.750 --> 03:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
pages one thing I would like to know
 
03:14:14.550 --> 03:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
from the Department as we go through is
 
03:14:17.229 --> 03:14:17.239 align:start position:0%
there anything
 
03:14:19.269 --> 03:14:19.279 align:start position:0%
um as we come to pages is there anything
 
03:14:20.870 --> 03:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
in House Bill
 
03:14:25.309 --> 03:14:25.319 align:start position:0%
two that relates to any of these uh
 
03:14:29.429 --> 03:14:29.439 align:start position:0%
budget pages okay is there um we only
 
03:14:31.790 --> 03:14:31.800 align:start position:0%
have a draft of House Bill two we don't
 
03:14:35.429 --> 03:14:35.439 align:start position:0%
have the final document but if there's
 
03:14:37.590 --> 03:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
something in House Bill 2 that is
 
03:14:40.590 --> 03:14:40.600 align:start position:0%
significant that we need to know that
 
03:14:44.550 --> 03:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
affects Pages as we go through we should
 
03:14:46.670 --> 03:14:46.680 align:start position:0%
um if you could bring that to our
 
03:14:46.680 --> 03:14:48.389 align:start position:0%
um if you could bring that to our
attention

03:14:48.389 --> 03:14:48.399 align:start position:0%
attention
 
03:14:50.710 --> 03:14:50.720 align:start position:0%
I will certainly do that I do not have a
 
03:14:53.389 --> 03:14:53.399 align:start position:0%
copy of hb2 so as soon as I do have a
 
03:14:56.710 --> 03:14:56.720 align:start position:0%
copy um I will be able to do that but to
 
03:14:58.269 --> 03:14:58.279 align:start position:0%
my knowledge there's nothing that
 
03:15:02.309 --> 03:15:02.319 align:start position:0%
affects uh this area or
 
03:15:05.030 --> 03:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
or that makes me curious about your
 
03:15:09.510 --> 03:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
process M RS are you are are are you
 
03:15:12.309 --> 03:15:12.319 align:start position:0%
made aware of what's going into hb2 as
 
03:15:14.630 --> 03:15:14.640 align:start position:0%
you're building the budget or is it a
 
03:15:18.030 --> 03:15:18.040 align:start position:0%
surprise to you at the same time it is a
 
03:15:21.710 --> 03:15:21.720 align:start position:0%
we make requests to to what we um need
 
03:15:24.670 --> 03:15:24.680 align:start position:0%
in House Bill 2 um but ultimately that's
 
03:15:27.950 --> 03:15:27.960 align:start position:0%
the governor's um it's the governor's
 
03:15:30.389 --> 03:15:30.399 align:start position:0%
recommendation so there I would say that
 
03:15:32.389 --> 03:15:32.399 align:start position:0%
I probably know about everything in it
 
03:15:34.510 --> 03:15:34.520 align:start position:0%
but I don't know for sure what's in it
 
03:15:36.710 --> 03:15:36.720 align:start position:0%
until I see the final published document
 
03:15:39.030 --> 03:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
right so you make a request and and it's
 
03:15:40.950 --> 03:15:40.960 align:start position:0%
probably going to be fulfilled but you
 
03:15:43.790 --> 03:15:43.800 align:start position:0%
don't know until you see it correct it's
 
03:15:45.389 --> 03:15:45.399 align:start position:0%
correct all
 
03:15:48.429 --> 03:15:48.439 align:start position:0%
right I do have one more I do have one
 
03:15:50.790 --> 03:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
more I'm sorry representative Wallner
 
03:15:50.800 --> 03:15:51.670 align:start position:0%
more I'm sorry representative Wallner
please

03:15:51.670 --> 03:15:51.680 align:start position:0%
please
 
03:15:54.150 --> 03:15:54.160 align:start position:0%
ask okay I'm
 
03:15:56.590 --> 03:15:56.600 align:start position:0%
sorry the other thing I'm wondering is
 
03:16:00.150 --> 03:16:00.160 align:start position:0%
is as we go through these Page by
 
03:16:02.389 --> 03:16:02.399 align:start position:0%
Page and we've started since we've
 
03:16:05.229 --> 03:16:05.239 align:start position:0%
already started this process can you
 
03:16:10.590 --> 03:16:10.600 align:start position:0%
also tell us of any items that you had
 
03:16:14.269 --> 03:16:14.279 align:start position:0%
in your budget requests that were not
 
03:16:18.229 --> 03:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
accepted and not included
 
03:16:19.990 --> 03:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
yes I will do my best to make sure that
 
03:16:23.550 --> 03:16:23.560 align:start position:0%
that happens as well okay thank you that
 
03:16:25.870 --> 03:16:25.880 align:start position:0%
that would be hard right because you'd
 
03:16:28.309 --> 03:16:28.319 align:start position:0%
have to you'd have to have a whole
 
03:16:30.229 --> 03:16:30.239 align:start position:0%
another spreadsheet in your
 
03:16:33.110 --> 03:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
head um yeah I probably have most of it
 
03:16:36.670 --> 03:16:36.680 align:start position:0%
in my head to be honest yeah God I'll
 
03:16:39.189 --> 03:16:39.199 align:start position:0%
forget a few things but but most of it
 
03:16:39.199 --> 03:16:40.110 align:start position:0%
forget a few things but but most of it
is

03:16:40.110 --> 03:16:40.120 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:16:43.229 --> 03:16:43.239 align:start position:0%
there and we also have those documents
 
03:16:44.550 --> 03:16:44.560 align:start position:0%
available to
 
03:16:47.950 --> 03:16:47.960 align:start position:0%
us we have those documents I just have I
 
03:16:49.950 --> 03:16:49.960 align:start position:0%
would have to dig them out but we do
 
03:16:52.269 --> 03:16:52.279 align:start position:0%
have them not in my head represent
 
03:16:54.269 --> 03:16:54.279 align:start position:0%
that's for sure no not in my head either
 
03:16:57.790 --> 03:16:57.800 align:start position:0%
I have to go find them so um okay so are
 
03:16:59.630 --> 03:16:59.640 align:start position:0%
we going to talk about general counsel
 
03:16:59.640 --> 03:17:01.389 align:start position:0%
we going to talk about general counsel
next

03:17:01.389 --> 03:17:01.399 align:start position:0%
next
 
03:17:04.349 --> 03:17:04.359 align:start position:0%
5680 or what are you talking about next
 
03:17:07.630 --> 03:17:07.640 align:start position:0%
yes 5680 general counsel and so to the
 
03:17:11.189 --> 03:17:11.199 align:start position:0%
earlier question this is where most of
 
03:17:15.309 --> 03:17:15.319 align:start position:0%
um everything that's not
 
03:17:17.870 --> 03:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
um everything that's
 
03:17:20.389 --> 03:17:20.399 align:start position:0%
not specified in another accounting unit
 
03:17:21.870 --> 03:17:21.880 align:start position:0%
those are all pretty clearly labeled
 
03:17:24.510 --> 03:17:24.520 align:start position:0%
what they are is here so when she when
 
03:17:26.510 --> 03:17:26.520 align:start position:0%
Melissa spoke about John Williams John
 
03:17:29.469 --> 03:17:29.479 align:start position:0%
Williams is in this accounting unit
 
03:17:32.710 --> 03:17:32.720 align:start position:0%
here M the one that cut
 
03:17:35.790 --> 03:17:35.800 align:start position:0%
down Melissa is also in this accounting
 
03:17:37.229 --> 03:17:37.239 align:start position:0%
you're gonna make John cry I hope he's
 
03:17:37.239 --> 03:17:38.910 align:start position:0%
you're gonna make John cry I hope he's
not

03:17:38.910 --> 03:17:38.920 align:start position:0%
not
 
03:17:42.710 --> 03:17:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:47.189 --> 03:17:47.199 align:start position:0%
question uh yes representative B so does
 
03:17:49.590 --> 03:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
that include all of those bulleted items
 
03:17:52.429 --> 03:17:52.439 align:start position:0%
that she had in that list of
 
03:17:55.710 --> 03:17:55.720 align:start position:0%
key points yes the Appeals Unit is a
 
03:17:58.229 --> 03:17:58.239 align:start position:0%
separate accounting unit um that's
 
03:18:00.269 --> 03:18:00.279 align:start position:0%
labeled I forget what that's labeled
 
03:18:02.309 --> 03:18:02.319 align:start position:0%
we'll get to it in a minute um but
 
03:18:04.870 --> 03:18:04.880 align:start position:0%
everything else is here yes okay thank
 
03:18:08.070 --> 03:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
you so so I have a question that covers
 
03:18:11.830 --> 03:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
the previous area and this one just just
 
03:18:15.429 --> 03:18:15.439 align:start position:0%
generally this agency income line how
 
03:18:18.550 --> 03:18:18.560 align:start position:0%
how is this being used in these in the
 
03:18:21.070 --> 03:18:21.080 align:start position:0%
health facilities and general
 
03:18:23.550 --> 03:18:23.560 align:start position:0%
counsel Beth what is the agency income
 
03:18:30.229 --> 03:18:30.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:36.229 --> 03:18:36.239 align:start position:0%
cases for um 5680 the majority of it is
 
03:18:40.030 --> 03:18:40.040 align:start position:0%
the estate recovery fees and the county
 
03:18:43.590 --> 03:18:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:47.269 --> 03:18:47.279 align:start position:0%
Fe and then 5146 is the
 
03:18:54.309 --> 03:18:54.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:58.670 --> 03:18:58.680 align:start position:0%
fees are those um do they find their way
 
03:19:01.670 --> 03:19:01.680 align:start position:0%
into your budget because uh that's in a
 
03:19:09.389 --> 03:19:09.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:11.950 --> 03:19:11.960 align:start position:0%
practice they would have to be in rsas
 
03:19:13.630 --> 03:19:13.640 align:start position:0%
to be restricted
 
03:19:15.870 --> 03:19:15.880 align:start position:0%
revenues Kevin correct me if I'm wrong
 
03:19:17.550 --> 03:19:17.560 align:start position:0%
but otherwise they would general fund
 
03:19:21.269 --> 03:19:21.279 align:start position:0%
Revenue that's true if it's not in RSA
 
03:19:22.710 --> 03:19:22.720 align:start position:0%
as a dedicated Revenue Source it
 
03:19:24.389 --> 03:19:24.399 align:start position:0%
automatically goes to the general fund
 
03:19:27.429 --> 03:19:27.439 align:start position:0%
so there must be a there must be a law
 
03:19:29.389 --> 03:19:29.399 align:start position:0%
somewhere that directs that directs
 
03:19:31.670 --> 03:19:31.680 align:start position:0%
these to the
 
03:19:34.429 --> 03:19:34.439 align:start position:0%
agency so every time okay got it every
 
03:19:36.469 --> 03:19:36.479 align:start position:0%
time I see an agency income there's an
 
03:19:40.389 --> 03:19:40.399 align:start position:0%
RSA somewhere uh setting it
 
03:19:43.590 --> 03:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
up there should be an RSA or a chap law
 
03:19:46.910 --> 03:19:46.920 align:start position:0%
yes now these are these are not the same
 
03:19:49.670 --> 03:19:49.680 align:start position:0%
thing as dedicated funds or are they
 
03:19:49.680 --> 03:19:53.389 align:start position:0%
thing as dedicated funds or are they
sometimes

03:19:53.389 --> 03:19:53.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:56.150 --> 03:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
no it's not the same as a dedicated fund
 
03:19:58.990 --> 03:19:59.000 align:start position:0%
that's a revolving
 
03:20:01.870 --> 03:20:01.880 align:start position:0%
account well I see what you see here is
 
03:20:05.110 --> 03:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
a revolving fund that 003 that is would
 
03:20:07.389 --> 03:20:07.399 align:start position:0%
be coming from a dedicated revolving
 
03:20:11.990 --> 03:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
fund but agency income um is restricted
 
03:20:15.429 --> 03:20:15.439 align:start position:0%
Revenue okay representative nordgren
 
03:20:17.670 --> 03:20:17.680 align:start position:0%
question thank thank you representative
 
03:20:21.150 --> 03:20:21.160 align:start position:0%
Edwards um we talked earlier about the
 
03:20:23.550 --> 03:20:23.560 align:start position:0%
book that Health and Human Services will
 
03:20:26.469 --> 03:20:26.479 align:start position:0%
be giving us that may or may not give us
 
03:20:29.630 --> 03:20:29.640 align:start position:0%
some of this information um Karen do you
 
03:20:32.990 --> 03:20:33.000 align:start position:0%

03:20:37.070 --> 03:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
I are just putting the finishing touches
 
03:20:39.950 --> 03:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
on it um believe it or not we're
 
03:20:41.590 --> 03:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
actually ahead of schedule I looked to
 
03:20:43.469 --> 03:20:43.479 align:start position:0%
two years ago and and we didn't provide
 
03:20:46.670 --> 03:20:46.680 align:start position:0%
it till almost the end of February so um
 
03:20:48.590 --> 03:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
hopefully you will have that in at least
 
03:20:48.600 --> 03:20:50.150 align:start position:0%
hopefully you will have that in at least
electronically

03:20:50.150 --> 03:20:50.160 align:start position:0%
electronically
 
03:20:53.830 --> 03:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
tomorrow okay so mailing it to Handover
 
03:20:57.349 --> 03:20:57.359 align:start position:0%
which takes a long time do we
 
03:21:02.229 --> 03:21:02.239 align:start position:0%
know we we got I'm gonna to Kevin yeah
 
03:21:04.830 --> 03:21:04.840 align:start position:0%
we'll I'm gonna have um copies printed
 
03:21:06.429 --> 03:21:06.439 align:start position:0%
up and mailed out to you as soon as we
 
03:21:09.790 --> 03:21:09.800 align:start position:0%
have it so uh if we have it by tomorrow
 
03:21:12.590 --> 03:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
morning then prob well if we have it by
 
03:21:14.070 --> 03:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
tomorrow then probably by Monday they'll
 
03:21:15.349 --> 03:21:15.359 align:start position:0%
go out in the
 
03:21:21.229 --> 03:21:21.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:24.070 --> 03:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
thanks are there any other questions on
 
03:21:28.510 --> 03:21:28.520 align:start position:0%
General Council it's going from 84 to 82
 
03:21:31.550 --> 03:21:31.560 align:start position:0%
FTE is is is
 
03:21:37.150 --> 03:21:37.160 align:start position:0%
that why it's not a lot but why they
 
03:21:38.710 --> 03:21:38.720 align:start position:0%
were likely transferred somewhere else
 
03:21:44.630 --> 03:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:47.189 --> 03:21:47.199 align:start position:0%
that and it'll always take be a minute
 
03:21:52.710 --> 03:21:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:55.189 --> 03:21:55.199 align:start position:0%
information plus that mute button can be
 
03:21:58.910 --> 03:21:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:01.590 --> 03:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
find sorry about that I actually am
 
03:22:03.830 --> 03:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
looking up information can I get back
 
03:22:06.229 --> 03:22:06.239 align:start position:0%
with you in a couple seconds sure sure
 
03:22:09.710 --> 03:22:09.720 align:start position:0%
it's it's not a material question uh I'm
 
03:22:12.550 --> 03:22:12.560 align:start position:0%
just curious I got curious so so what
 
03:22:15.790 --> 03:22:15.800 align:start position:0%
are we G to do next M RS which which all
 
03:22:17.990 --> 03:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
right the next one is community
 
03:22:18.000 --> 03:22:50.110 align:start position:0%
right the next one is community
residences

03:22:50.110 --> 03:22:50.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:52.910 --> 03:22:52.920 align:start position:0%
this is not a lot of money relative to
 
03:22:55.910 --> 03:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
other things oh is it it is not it is
 
03:22:59.830 --> 03:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
mostly just staff and support for the
 
03:23:02.389 --> 03:23:02.399 align:start position:0%
staff so are there any questions about
 
03:23:02.399 --> 03:23:06.670 align:start position:0%
staff so are there any questions about
Community

03:23:06.670 --> 03:23:06.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:10.070 --> 03:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
residences all right seeing none I think
 
03:23:12.349 --> 03:23:12.359 align:start position:0%
we're ready to go to the next one all
 
03:23:13.830 --> 03:23:13.840 align:start position:0%
right the next one starts at the bottom
 
03:23:15.429 --> 03:23:15.439 align:start position:0%
of this page it's
 
03:23:17.710 --> 03:23:17.720 align:start position:0%
5683 which is Operation support
 
03:23:20.229 --> 03:23:20.239 align:start position:0%
Administration which is the Appeals Unit
 
03:23:22.670 --> 03:23:22.680 align:start position:0%
so this just has class 10 on this page
 
03:23:23.790 --> 03:23:23.800 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to go ahead and go to the
 
03:23:23.800 --> 03:23:31.710 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to go ahead and go to the
next

03:23:31.710 --> 03:23:31.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:36.269 --> 03:23:36.279 align:start position:0%
page okay so this is going up
 
03:23:40.070 --> 03:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
48% and what's driving this people it's
 
03:23:42.070 --> 03:23:42.080 align:start position:0%
not the people number Chang and is this
 
03:23:43.670 --> 03:23:43.680 align:start position:0%
at the same cost
 
03:23:46.870 --> 03:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
allocation explanation the total budget
 
03:23:49.189 --> 03:23:49.199 align:start position:0%
is is the benefits that's driving it up
 
03:24:02.830 --> 03:24:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:06.510 --> 03:24:06.520 align:start position:0%
allocation employee training goes up but
 
03:24:10.189 --> 03:24:10.199 align:start position:0%
that's okay and then federal funds
 
03:24:10.199 --> 03:24:11.870 align:start position:0%
that's okay and then federal funds
dropped

03:24:11.870 --> 03:24:11.880 align:start position:0%
dropped
 
03:24:14.830 --> 03:24:14.840 align:start position:0%
12% is is this that is that that's also
 
03:24:17.269 --> 03:24:17.279 align:start position:0%
the cost allocation issue
 
03:24:18.910 --> 03:24:18.920 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I missed the beginning part of
 
03:24:21.950 --> 03:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
your I'm noticing that the federal funds
 
03:24:21.960 --> 03:24:23.189 align:start position:0%
your I'm noticing that the federal funds
dropped

03:24:23.189 --> 03:24:23.199 align:start position:0%
dropped
 
03:24:26.309 --> 03:24:26.319 align:start position:0%
12% yes that's the change in the cost
 
03:24:28.510 --> 03:24:28.520 align:start position:0%
allocation all
 
03:24:31.389 --> 03:24:31.399 align:start position:0%
right and I keep asking that because if
 
03:24:34.189 --> 03:24:34.199 align:start position:0%
we've if we've done something to where
 
03:24:36.750 --> 03:24:36.760 align:start position:0%
we're no longer eligible because of a
 
03:24:38.950 --> 03:24:38.960 align:start position:0%
decision we've made or a mistake we've
 
03:24:41.910 --> 03:24:41.920 align:start position:0%
made I I I'd like to know about those
 
03:24:45.229 --> 03:24:45.239 align:start position:0%
those are probably pretty rare I imagine
 
03:24:47.429 --> 03:24:47.439 align:start position:0%
we try to keep them pretty rare yes they
 
03:24:50.030 --> 03:24:50.040 align:start position:0%
they do occasionally happen um you will
 
03:24:53.429 --> 03:24:53.439 align:start position:0%
hear when uh Meredith tus uh presents
 
03:24:55.469 --> 03:24:55.479 align:start position:0%
about audit findings and occasionally we
 
03:24:59.269 --> 03:24:59.279 align:start position:0%
do have times where we are penalized for
 
03:25:01.870 --> 03:25:01.880 align:start position:0%
for different issues with audits but um
 
03:25:05.189 --> 03:25:05.199 align:start position:0%
this is not one of those scenarios
 
03:25:07.630 --> 03:25:07.640 align:start position:0%
thankfully are there any questions from
 
03:25:12.790 --> 03:25:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:15.590 --> 03:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
Administration I'm seeing none is on
 
03:25:16.990 --> 03:25:17.000 align:start position:0%
budsman next
 
03:25:20.630 --> 03:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
it is 56.96 on page I love it when a
 
03:25:22.349 --> 03:25:22.359 align:start position:0%
plan comes
 
03:25:31.950 --> 03:25:31.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:34.990 --> 03:25:35.000 align:start position:0%
1175 and this this represents what I was
 
03:25:36.469 --> 03:25:36.479 align:start position:0%
speaking about earlier about cost
 
03:25:38.389 --> 03:25:38.399 align:start position:0%
allocation and how sometimes it can be
 
03:25:41.110 --> 03:25:41.120 align:start position:0%
very low dollars in this case the cost
 
03:25:46.389 --> 03:25:46.399 align:start position:0%
allocation um has $7 for for this agent
 
03:25:48.750 --> 03:25:48.760 align:start position:0%
the income so those are the types of
 
03:25:50.429 --> 03:25:50.439 align:start position:0%
scenarios where occasionally there are
 
03:25:52.150 --> 03:25:52.160 align:start position:0%
very low numbers but we're trying to
 
03:25:55.229 --> 03:25:55.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:58.309 --> 03:25:58.319 align:start position:0%
appropriately that's extremely
 
03:26:00.510 --> 03:26:00.520 align:start position:0%
precise you should see your cost
 
03:26:02.550 --> 03:26:02.560 align:start position:0%
allocation system Kevin has seen it it
 
03:26:06.950 --> 03:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
is it is quite complicated and uh very
 
03:26:09.469 --> 03:26:09.479 align:start position:0%
precise okay so this is not a lot of
 
03:26:11.630 --> 03:26:11.640 align:start position:0%
money is there anything else interesting
 
03:26:14.189 --> 03:26:14.199 align:start position:0%
going on in here like uh we've got some
 
03:26:16.910 --> 03:26:16.920 align:start position:0%
personal services
 
03:26:20.510 --> 03:26:20.520 align:start position:0%
uh going up are we are we converting a
 
03:26:22.670 --> 03:26:22.680 align:start position:0%
temporary to a permanent or something in
 
03:26:24.990 --> 03:26:25.000 align:start position:0%
here I don't think so because the num
 
03:26:27.309 --> 03:26:27.319 align:start position:0%
the total number of positions didn't go
 
03:26:30.670 --> 03:26:30.680 align:start position:0%
up um those numbers again are are
 
03:26:32.910 --> 03:26:32.920 align:start position:0%
dictated To Us by Das but I'm not sure
 
03:26:35.110 --> 03:26:35.120 align:start position:0%
if Beth might know why that one went up
 
03:26:37.510 --> 03:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
so much although it looks like the
 
03:26:40.269 --> 03:26:40.279 align:start position:0%
actuals in fiscal year 20 were actually
 
03:26:42.950 --> 03:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
higher than what we have budgeted in 21
 
03:26:44.550 --> 03:26:44.560 align:start position:0%
so it could be that somebody was hired
 
03:26:46.950 --> 03:26:46.960 align:start position:0%
at a higher step
 
03:26:51.990 --> 03:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:55.269 --> 03:26:55.279 align:start position:0%
reason that's okay are there any other
 
03:27:00.950 --> 03:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:03.070 --> 03:27:03.080 align:start position:0%
Ombudsman I don't I don't want to hurry
 
03:27:03.080 --> 03:27:03.950 align:start position:0%
Ombudsman I don't I don't want to hurry
it

03:27:03.950 --> 03:27:03.960 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:27:08.150 --> 03:27:08.160 align:start position:0%
but should keep moving if um all right
 
03:27:12.950 --> 03:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
so long-term care on budsman next this
 
03:27:15.429 --> 03:27:15.439 align:start position:0%
is really great it's like somebody built
 
03:27:18.950 --> 03:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:22.750 --> 03:27:22.760 align:start position:0%
right okay so we see a drop in the
 
03:27:26.189 --> 03:27:26.199 align:start position:0%
general fund of 7% here it's not a huge
 
03:27:29.349 --> 03:27:29.359 align:start position:0%
amount of money but is this one of the
 
03:27:32.670 --> 03:27:32.680 align:start position:0%
donors for the cost allocation maybe I I
 
03:27:34.070 --> 03:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
guess you could look at it that way but
 
03:27:35.590 --> 03:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
yes this would be a change because of
 
03:27:35.600 --> 03:27:36.429 align:start position:0%
yes this would be a change because of
cost

03:27:36.429 --> 03:27:36.439 align:start position:0%
cost
 
03:27:39.189 --> 03:27:39.199 align:start position:0%
allocation we also reduced the overall
 
03:27:44.630 --> 03:27:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:47.349 --> 03:27:47.359 align:start position:0%
well what what what allowed you to
 
03:27:50.429 --> 03:27:50.439 align:start position:0%
change the overall budget it looks like
 
03:27:52.110 --> 03:27:52.120 align:start position:0%
there was some money budgeted for
 
03:27:55.710 --> 03:27:55.720 align:start position:0%
contracts for program services that um
 
03:27:57.429 --> 03:27:57.439 align:start position:0%
that's no longer being budgeted it must
 
03:27:59.510 --> 03:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
no longer be needed I don't know if
 
03:28:04.790 --> 03:28:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:08.590 --> 03:28:08.600 align:start position:0%
that no I don't I think that the um
 
03:28:11.110 --> 03:28:11.120 align:start position:0%
travel reimbursement is also
 
03:28:13.269 --> 03:28:13.279 align:start position:0%
down the our instate travel
 
03:28:15.110 --> 03:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
reimbursement was at
 
03:28:20.710 --> 03:28:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:23.590 --> 03:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
30 right we also reduceed the the travel
 
03:28:26.750 --> 03:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
in state and out of state
 
03:28:28.590 --> 03:28:28.600 align:start position:0%
travel that was something that you'll
 
03:28:30.910 --> 03:28:30.920 align:start position:0%
see across the entire department as I
 
03:28:34.229 --> 03:28:34.239 align:start position:0%
redu I asked that every area take a look
 
03:28:36.469 --> 03:28:36.479 align:start position:0%
at their current expenses and their in
 
03:28:39.070 --> 03:28:39.080 align:start position:0%
and out of state travel um and their
 
03:28:41.189 --> 03:28:41.199 align:start position:0%
contracts and and look for ways that
 
03:28:44.429 --> 03:28:44.439 align:start position:0%
they could reduce those sure I imagine
 
03:28:48.389 --> 03:28:48.399 align:start position:0%
you guys have some fairly tight um
 
03:28:50.710 --> 03:28:50.720 align:start position:0%
administrative procedures to control out
 
03:28:53.870 --> 03:28:53.880 align:start position:0%
ofate travel at this point the deputy
 
03:28:55.389 --> 03:28:55.399 align:start position:0%
commit well first of all out ofate
 
03:28:58.070 --> 03:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
travel right now has to be approved by
 
03:29:00.910 --> 03:29:00.920 align:start position:0%
the governor um so we do very little out
 
03:29:02.870 --> 03:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
ofate travel right now as a department
 
03:29:05.189 --> 03:29:05.199 align:start position:0%
except for when required when servicing
 
03:29:09.630 --> 03:29:09.640 align:start position:0%
clients um but even in non- times of of
 
03:29:12.710 --> 03:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
out State travel needing to be uh
 
03:29:14.910 --> 03:29:14.920 align:start position:0%
approved by the governor all out ofate
 
03:29:20.590 --> 03:29:20.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:23.550 --> 03:29:23.560 align:start position:0%
Commissioner so um are there any other
 
03:29:25.510 --> 03:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
questions from anyone on the committee
 
03:29:32.790 --> 03:29:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:36.229 --> 03:29:36.239 align:start position:0%
Ombudsman so if I remember correctly oh
 
03:29:37.830 --> 03:29:37.840 align:start position:0%
then there's just the totals for legal
 
03:29:40.550 --> 03:29:40.560 align:start position:0%
and Regulatory services so that's the
 
03:29:43.070 --> 03:29:43.080 align:start position:0%
last accounting unit and in Melissa's
 
03:29:46.630 --> 03:29:46.640 align:start position:0%
area Okay so so these this page isn't
 
03:29:49.269 --> 03:29:49.279 align:start position:0%
would not be reflected in my spreadsheet
 
03:29:52.110 --> 03:29:52.120 align:start position:0%
that I'm looking at right this last page
 
03:29:54.229 --> 03:29:54.239 align:start position:0%
that has all of the totals I don't think
 
03:29:56.429 --> 03:29:56.439 align:start position:0%
I don't know I don't know it wouldn't
 
03:29:58.870 --> 03:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
make sense for it to be in
 
03:30:04.269 --> 03:30:04.279 align:start position:0%
there all right well so so thank you
 
03:30:06.950 --> 03:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
um so are there any questions from
 
03:30:08.790 --> 03:30:08.800 align:start position:0%
anyone on the committee about anything
 
03:30:11.790 --> 03:30:11.800 align:start position:0%
we've just covered in the legal
 
03:30:15.630 --> 03:30:15.640 align:start position:0%
area because I I think uh I think Miss
 
03:30:20.309 --> 03:30:20.319 align:start position:0%
SA SE it is getting ready to take
 
03:30:22.990 --> 03:30:23.000 align:start position:0%
off she's got a two o'clock and you're
 
03:30:27.110 --> 03:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
going to get there early yes thank
 
03:30:29.790 --> 03:30:29.800 align:start position:0%
you thank you everyone for your time
 
03:30:31.189 --> 03:30:31.199 align:start position:0%
please reach out if you do need anything
 
03:30:34.990 --> 03:30:35.000 align:start position:0%
or anything comes up yes ma'am thank
 
03:30:38.070 --> 03:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
you okay so I wasn't sure chair if you
 
03:30:39.790 --> 03:30:39.800 align:start position:0%
would like to now go back to the
 
03:30:42.389 --> 03:30:42.399 align:start position:0%
accounting units that Lori Weaver and I
 
03:30:45.630 --> 03:30:45.640 align:start position:0%
presented that'd be great she's here too
 
03:30:48.550 --> 03:30:48.560 align:start position:0%
she is she also does have to leave at 2
 
03:30:51.030 --> 03:30:51.040 align:start position:0%
o00 but her uh staff will be able to
 
03:30:53.030 --> 03:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
stay on so we will be able to answer any
 
03:30:55.950 --> 03:30:55.960 align:start position:0%
questions so we're gonna start I
 
03:30:57.790 --> 03:30:57.800 align:start position:0%
actually have to leave at 1:45 for the
 
03:31:01.750 --> 03:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
two o'clock so sorry my uh my staff are
 
03:31:03.630 --> 03:31:03.640 align:start position:0%
planning on being on it too based on
 
03:31:05.229 --> 03:31:05.239 align:start position:0%
before we broke what we said let me see
 
03:31:06.870 --> 03:31:06.880 align:start position:0%
if I can get them to come a little
 
03:31:06.880 --> 03:31:09.070 align:start position:0%
if I can get them to come a little
earlier

03:31:09.070 --> 03:31:09.080 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
03:31:11.269 --> 03:31:11.279 align:start position:0%
okay so which number are we going to
 
03:31:15.389 --> 03:31:15.399 align:start position:0%
look at for with her uh the 1159 no the
 
03:31:15.399 --> 03:31:16.630 align:start position:0%
look at for with her uh the 1159 no the
5,000

03:31:16.630 --> 03:31:16.640 align:start position:0%
5,000
 
03:31:33.309 --> 03:31:33.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:35.510 --> 03:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
1159 and this is one of those accounting
 
03:31:37.550 --> 03:31:37.560 align:start position:0%
units that starts on one page and goes
 
03:31:41.510 --> 03:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
on to the next so I um blow this up as
 
03:31:42.830 --> 03:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
you did the other
 
03:31:45.070 --> 03:31:45.080 align:start position:0%
ones yep sorry I thought I left it
 
03:31:48.229 --> 03:31:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:52.070 --> 03:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
there we go oops so this accounting unit
 
03:31:54.189 --> 03:31:54.199 align:start position:0%
um has the first two class lines here at
 
03:31:55.510 --> 03:31:55.520 align:start position:0%
the bottom of this page so I'm going to
 
03:31:57.590 --> 03:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
go ahead and go to the next page where
 
03:32:00.429 --> 03:32:00.439 align:start position:0%
the majority of the accounting unit
 
03:32:03.790 --> 03:32:03.800 align:start position:0%
is so this is the commissioner's office
 
03:32:06.110 --> 03:32:06.120 align:start position:0%
this is where the commissioner and the
 
03:32:08.269 --> 03:32:08.279 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner and the associate
 
03:32:11.070 --> 03:32:11.080 align:start position:0%
commissioner positions are so most of
 
03:32:14.870 --> 03:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
these um as you can see going back to
 
03:32:16.910 --> 03:32:16.920 align:start position:0%
that previous page a lot of the salary
 
03:32:18.910 --> 03:32:18.920 align:start position:0%
and benefits are actually in an
 
03:32:21.389 --> 03:32:21.399 align:start position:0%
unclassified um class line not a
 
03:32:23.630 --> 03:32:23.640 align:start position:0%
classified class
 
03:32:27.950 --> 03:32:27.960 align:start position:0%
line um also within this area would be
 
03:32:27.960 --> 03:32:29.950 align:start position:0%
line um also within this area would be
our

03:32:29.950 --> 03:32:29.960 align:start position:0%
our
 
03:32:29.960 --> 03:32:31.950 align:start position:0%
our
um

03:32:31.950 --> 03:32:31.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:32:37.390 --> 03:32:37.400 align:start position:0%
uh Pio office um so our
 
03:32:37.400 --> 03:32:40.750 align:start position:0%
uh Pio office um so our
[Music]

03:32:40.750 --> 03:32:40.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:43.750 --> 03:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
um Communications office is within this
 
03:32:46.429 --> 03:32:46.439 align:start position:0%
accounting unit sorry Shar going to jump
 
03:32:48.870 --> 03:32:48.880 align:start position:0%
in but thank you I'm like why can I not
 
03:32:52.110 --> 03:32:52.120 align:start position:0%
think of the word please go ahead public
 
03:32:54.790 --> 03:32:54.800 align:start position:0%
information office yes thank
 
03:33:01.630 --> 03:33:01.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:04.429 --> 03:33:04.439 align:start position:0%
chair so Karen does this also have HR
 
03:33:07.030 --> 03:33:07.040 align:start position:0%
and EAP and facilities in it or just HR
 
03:33:10.229 --> 03:33:10.239 align:start position:0%
and EAP uh nope EAP and HR have their
 
03:33:14.189 --> 03:33:14.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:17.269 --> 03:33:17.279 align:start position:0%
units so the only thing on the salaries
 
03:33:19.710 --> 03:33:19.720 align:start position:0%
is that it's not just the positions you
 
03:33:21.229 --> 03:33:21.239 align:start position:0%
mentioned I think there's a bulk of the
 
03:33:23.309 --> 03:33:23.319 align:start position:0%
unclassified positions that are budgeted
 
03:33:27.429 --> 03:33:27.439 align:start position:0%
out of oom not solely but there's a big
 
03:33:29.429 --> 03:33:29.439 align:start position:0%
chunk there so when we look at that
 
03:33:31.189 --> 03:33:31.199 align:start position:0%
figure it is in four or five positions
 
03:33:34.389 --> 03:33:34.399 align:start position:0%
we have about 88 unclassified positions
 
03:33:36.469 --> 03:33:36.479 align:start position:0%
um and most of them come out of
 
03:33:38.910 --> 03:33:38.920 align:start position:0%
oom only 10 of them are in this
 
03:33:41.269 --> 03:33:41.279 align:start position:0%
accounting unit though okay I knew you'd
 
03:33:46.389 --> 03:33:46.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:49.309 --> 03:33:49.319 align:start position:0%
I what what would you is I don't would
 
03:33:51.710 --> 03:33:51.720 align:start position:0%
you like me to answer questions on this
 
03:33:53.910 --> 03:33:53.920 align:start position:0%
Karen or yeah I'm not sure if there are
 
03:33:55.469 --> 03:33:55.479 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
03:33:58.710 --> 03:33:58.720 align:start position:0%
okay well okay so if the committee has
 
03:34:01.269 --> 03:34:01.279 align:start position:0%
questions we'll do that U but I'm still
 
03:34:03.710 --> 03:34:03.720 align:start position:0%
just trying to find it on my spreadsheet
 
03:34:06.150 --> 03:34:06.160 align:start position:0%
and that's not your problem that's
 
03:34:08.389 --> 03:34:08.399 align:start position:0%
mine um that's because there's probably
 
03:34:11.110 --> 03:34:11.120 align:start position:0%
a lot of 5,000 well there's a lot of
 
03:34:13.309 --> 03:34:13.319 align:start position:0%
5000s and would you believe it we have
 
03:34:16.630 --> 03:34:16.640 align:start position:0%
more than one commissioner
 
03:34:20.670 --> 03:34:20.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:22.830 --> 03:34:22.840 align:start position:0%
that yes so we'll wait a minute and I
 
03:34:25.750 --> 03:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
know that um Deputy Commissioner Weaver
 
03:34:28.870 --> 03:34:28.880 align:start position:0%
is also working to get her they're on
 
03:34:31.269 --> 03:34:31.279 align:start position:0%
they're on now okay great so we've got I
 
03:34:33.110 --> 03:34:33.120 align:start position:0%
don't know if Kevin can bring them over
 
03:34:38.550 --> 03:34:38.560 align:start position:0%
uh Paula Booth uh Stacy Silva and Dave
 
03:34:40.870 --> 03:34:40.880 align:start position:0%
clap what page number are you on Karen
 
03:34:41.790 --> 03:34:41.800 align:start position:0%
in your
 
03:34:54.389 --> 03:34:54.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:58.150 --> 03:34:58.160 align:start position:0%
Beth while um the chair is looking um
 
03:35:00.349 --> 03:35:00.359 align:start position:0%
for the accounting unit did you find an
 
03:35:02.229 --> 03:35:02.239 align:start position:0%
answer to those two positions that moved
 
03:35:04.030 --> 03:35:04.040 align:start position:0%
out of
 
03:35:07.550 --> 03:35:07.560 align:start position:0%
legal I did um there were two positions
 
03:35:09.110 --> 03:35:09.120 align:start position:0%
that were
 
03:35:12.710 --> 03:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
originally budgeted in child support
 
03:35:15.070 --> 03:35:15.080 align:start position:0%
legal but it was determined that they
 
03:35:18.309 --> 03:35:18.319 align:start position:0%
should be mov to child support program
 
03:35:19.710 --> 03:35:19.720 align:start position:0%
so they were taken out of there and
 
03:35:22.670 --> 03:35:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:28.910 --> 03:35:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:31.349 --> 03:35:31.359 align:start position:0%
you I know representative Earth was just
 
03:35:33.670 --> 03:35:33.680 align:start position:0%
waiting to hear that we moved positions
 
03:35:36.070 --> 03:35:36.080 align:start position:0%
I know he was waiting for that
 
03:35:37.950 --> 03:35:37.960 align:start position:0%
answer sorry that's going to be our
 
03:35:47.630 --> 03:35:47.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:51.349 --> 03:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:55.990 --> 03:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
it were you able to find it y okay so
 
03:35:58.990 --> 03:35:59.000 align:start position:0%
this is one where the general
 
03:36:02.309 --> 03:36:02.319 align:start position:0%
funds went up
 
03:36:09.309 --> 03:36:09.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:12.630 --> 03:36:12.640 align:start position:0%
average and yeah I wanted to ask about
 
03:36:16.389 --> 03:36:16.399 align:start position:0%
the indirect costs what what what
 
03:36:20.870 --> 03:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
the indirect costs go up I think
 
03:36:24.830 --> 03:36:24.840 align:start position:0%
124% and basically double in the 390,000
 
03:36:28.189 --> 03:36:28.199 align:start position:0%
growth that's actually material so so
 
03:36:31.349 --> 03:36:31.359 align:start position:0%
what's going on with that sure that um
 
03:36:33.229 --> 03:36:33.239 align:start position:0%
that number I believe is also set by
 
03:36:35.189 --> 03:36:35.199 align:start position:0%
administrative services but Beth do you
 
03:36:40.870 --> 03:36:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:44.670 --> 03:36:44.680 align:start position:0%
that now that's exactly right um Daz
 
03:36:49.150 --> 03:36:49.160 align:start position:0%
gives us a for formula to use based on
 
03:36:52.229 --> 03:36:52.239 align:start position:0%
um is that the salaries is that the one
 
03:36:54.670 --> 03:36:54.680 align:start position:0%
they just give us a flat Fe they just
 
03:36:56.830 --> 03:36:56.840 align:start position:0%
give us a number
 
03:37:01.910 --> 03:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
um that um they're expecting to bill us
 
03:37:05.990 --> 03:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
over the next year and that's what we
 
03:37:09.670 --> 03:37:09.680 align:start position:0%
budget okay so but this more than double
 
03:37:13.070 --> 03:37:13.080 align:start position:0%
so it makes me wonder Department wide
 
03:37:15.150 --> 03:37:15.160 align:start position:0%
what's going on with indirect costs if
 
03:37:17.070 --> 03:37:17.080 align:start position:0%
you got
 
03:37:21.590 --> 03:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
smooth or if it just went up a
 
03:37:21.600 --> 03:37:24.870 align:start position:0%
smooth or if it just went up a
lot

03:37:24.870 --> 03:37:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:29.189 --> 03:37:29.199 align:start position:0%
um I I believe in the past we may have
 
03:37:32.670 --> 03:37:32.680 align:start position:0%
spread the cost across more accounting
 
03:37:36.550 --> 03:37:36.560 align:start position:0%
units I'd be happy to look into that um
 
03:37:38.389 --> 03:37:38.399 align:start position:0%
but it is a number that we're provided
 
03:37:43.110 --> 03:37:43.120 align:start position:0%
and required to budget Mr chairman go
 
03:37:45.510 --> 03:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
ahead I remember something from the
 
03:37:47.590 --> 03:37:47.600 align:start position:0%
Governor's budget briefing from Charlie
 
03:37:50.990 --> 03:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
Arling house adding a new cost I think
 
03:37:52.950 --> 03:37:52.960 align:start position:0%
it was either adding the cleaning cost
 
03:37:55.429 --> 03:37:55.439 align:start position:0%
to the rent or some cost he hadn't added
 
03:37:59.150 --> 03:37:59.160 align:start position:0%
to the rent before so we may see it in
 
03:38:02.750 --> 03:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
every line from what I yes sir I I was
 
03:38:04.550 --> 03:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
just noting though that it it was
 
03:38:07.590 --> 03:38:07.600 align:start position:0%
doubling from the previous year from 316
 
03:38:10.110 --> 03:38:10.120 align:start position:0%
to 7006 on
 
03:38:13.389 --> 03:38:13.399 align:start position:0%
average so it's it's a it's big it's
 
03:38:16.349 --> 03:38:16.359 align:start position:0%
that's a lot of cleaning but maybe
 
03:38:18.189 --> 03:38:18.199 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of cleaning I don't know
 
03:38:20.870 --> 03:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
well and it does look like in fiscal 21
 
03:38:22.950 --> 03:38:22.960 align:start position:0%
that it was under budgeted because our
 
03:38:25.590 --> 03:38:25.600 align:start position:0%
actuals in 20 were 500,000 and it's
 
03:38:30.510 --> 03:38:30.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:34.269 --> 03:38:34.279 align:start position:0%
21 I did take the average of those two
 
03:38:36.630 --> 03:38:36.640 align:start position:0%
for my simple little formula but but
 
03:38:38.710 --> 03:38:38.720 align:start position:0%
you're have to look and see if it's in
 
03:38:40.590 --> 03:38:40.600 align:start position:0%
every line or if it's just mainly in the
 
03:38:40.600 --> 03:38:42.630 align:start position:0%
every line or if it's just mainly in the
commission's

03:38:42.630 --> 03:38:42.640 align:start position:0%
commission's
 
03:38:48.229 --> 03:38:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:52.309 --> 03:38:52.319 align:start position:0%
all right so um so you've got one more
 
03:38:52.319 --> 03:38:53.830 align:start position:0%
all right so um so you've got one more
unclassified

03:38:53.830 --> 03:38:53.840 align:start position:0%
unclassified
 
03:38:56.429 --> 03:38:56.439 align:start position:0%
position one it now remind me
 
03:39:00.070 --> 03:39:00.080 align:start position:0%
unclassified means that uh they're
 
03:39:02.790 --> 03:39:02.800 align:start position:0%
they're they have pens essentially have
 
03:39:06.229 --> 03:39:06.239 align:start position:0%
a negotiated salary or or what what's
 
03:39:09.110 --> 03:39:09.120 align:start position:0%
the distinction between unclassified
 
03:39:11.670 --> 03:39:11.680 align:start position:0%
positions and permanent
 
03:39:13.710 --> 03:39:13.720 align:start position:0%
classified Lori Weaver do you want to
 
03:39:15.469 --> 03:39:15.479 align:start position:0%
answer that so the r unclassified
 
03:39:18.309 --> 03:39:18.319 align:start position:0%
positions are unrepresented positions so
 
03:39:20.150 --> 03:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
they're not uh part of the union and
 
03:39:23.150 --> 03:39:23.160 align:start position:0%
they have a different uh salary schedule
 
03:39:25.429 --> 03:39:25.439 align:start position:0%
so they're on a letter system not a
 
03:39:28.790 --> 03:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
labor grade system um that applies for
 
03:39:31.429 --> 03:39:31.439 align:start position:0%
All State agencies in that L letter
 
03:39:34.429 --> 03:39:34.439 align:start position:0%
grade I think there's it goes a through
 
03:39:37.389 --> 03:39:37.399 align:start position:0%
P I think and then there's seven steps
 
03:39:40.229 --> 03:39:40.239 align:start position:0%
within each of those letter grades so
 
03:39:43.630 --> 03:39:43.640 align:start position:0%
the salaries um are supposed to start uh
 
03:39:46.189 --> 03:39:46.199 align:start position:0%
at one and if it's start hire you have
 
03:39:48.670 --> 03:39:48.680 align:start position:0%
to ask permission from
 
03:39:52.150 --> 03:39:52.160 align:start position:0%
D so so who is being hired here what
 
03:39:54.269 --> 03:39:54.279 align:start position:0%
what job
 
03:39:56.830 --> 03:39:56.840 align:start position:0%
description there's it's a new one a new
 
03:39:59.110 --> 03:39:59.120 align:start position:0%
job description in the commissioner's
 
03:40:01.790 --> 03:40:01.800 align:start position:0%
office we didn't create a new position
 
03:40:04.830 --> 03:40:04.840 align:start position:0%
it it was moved from somewhere else we
 
03:40:08.150 --> 03:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
cannot create um unclassified positions
 
03:40:10.710 --> 03:40:10.720 align:start position:0%
the legislature creates
 
03:40:12.950 --> 03:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
them so we could let you know which
 
03:40:15.590 --> 03:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
position moved
 
03:40:18.429 --> 03:40:18.439 align:start position:0%
well if it you know we're going to ask
 
03:40:20.389 --> 03:40:20.399 align:start position:0%
you so many questions don't don't chase
 
03:40:23.510 --> 03:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
that one down just because uh if it if
 
03:40:25.389 --> 03:40:25.399 align:start position:0%
it's not really an addition and it's
 
03:40:28.990 --> 03:40:29.000 align:start position:0%
just a a move it's less
 
03:40:31.950 --> 03:40:31.960 align:start position:0%
interesting yeah no there it's unlikely
 
03:40:33.429 --> 03:40:33.439 align:start position:0%
that we're going to see well we won't
 
03:40:34.950 --> 03:40:34.960 align:start position:0%
see any additions other than those
 
03:40:36.550 --> 03:40:36.560 align:start position:0%
conversions which are mostly in New
 
03:40:38.950 --> 03:40:38.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital um and those would
 
03:40:41.910 --> 03:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
all be classified
 
03:40:44.229 --> 03:40:44.239 align:start position:0%
positions so does anyone have any
 
03:40:46.469 --> 03:40:46.479 align:start position:0%
questions about the off Office of the
 
03:40:49.189 --> 03:40:49.199 align:start position:0%
commissioner from the committee as a
 
03:40:50.309 --> 03:40:50.319 align:start position:0%
result of
 
03:40:54.110 --> 03:40:54.120 align:start position:0%
the pmic okay so I think we're ready to
 
03:40:56.110 --> 03:40:56.120 align:start position:0%
go to your next
 
03:41:00.429 --> 03:41:00.439 align:start position:0%
area EX order the next accounting unit
 
03:41:04.269 --> 03:41:04.279 align:start position:0%
is 5025 which is the employee assistance
 
03:41:10.590 --> 03:41:10.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:16.550 --> 03:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:21.030 --> 03:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
okay so I'm
 
03:41:25.870 --> 03:41:25.880 align:start position:0%
there and this only goes up of 3%
 
03:41:28.950 --> 03:41:28.960 align:start position:0%
overall yes and this is actually one of
 
03:41:31.990 --> 03:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
those areas that the general funds are
 
03:41:34.269 --> 03:41:34.279 align:start position:0%
down from fiscal year 21 from a cost
 
03:41:38.349 --> 03:41:38.359 align:start position:0%
allocation change so we got a an a
 
03:41:40.510 --> 03:41:40.520 align:start position:0%
little bit of a kicker from the federal
 
03:41:43.349 --> 03:41:43.359 align:start position:0%
funds is that an allocation issue or did
 
03:41:50.550 --> 03:41:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:50.560 --> 03:41:52.710 align:start position:0%
 
change

03:41:52.710 --> 03:41:52.720 align:start position:0%
change
 
03:41:57.590 --> 03:41:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:01.309 --> 03:42:01.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:04.149 --> 03:42:04.159 align:start position:0%
none okay the next accounting unit is
 
03:42:06.389 --> 03:42:06.399 align:start position:0%
the one near and dear to my heart which
 
03:42:09.550 --> 03:42:09.560 align:start position:0%
is 5676 office of business operations
 
03:42:13.389 --> 03:42:13.399 align:start position:0%
this is uh finance and uh procurement um
 
03:42:14.750 --> 03:42:14.760 align:start position:0%
a couple of things that I would just
 
03:42:18.149 --> 03:42:18.159 align:start position:0%
mention here the Telecommunications line
 
03:42:20.870 --> 03:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
those are not just the phones for for my
 
03:42:24.670 --> 03:42:24.680 align:start position:0%
staff those are the desk phones of the
 
03:42:26.790 --> 03:42:26.800 align:start position:0%
entire department so when you see
 
03:42:28.710 --> 03:42:28.720 align:start position:0%
telecommunications and other budgets
 
03:42:31.269 --> 03:42:31.279 align:start position:0%
it's for cell phones this is just for
 
03:42:34.429 --> 03:42:34.439 align:start position:0%
the desk phones uh we did that last bium
 
03:42:36.389 --> 03:42:36.399 align:start position:0%
and it was very successful and worked a
 
03:42:39.670 --> 03:42:39.680 align:start position:0%
lot better and because of that we also
 
03:42:42.349 --> 03:42:42.359 align:start position:0%
did something similar in class line 22
 
03:42:45.950 --> 03:42:45.960 align:start position:0%
you see that go from 3,000 up to 200
 
03:42:48.710 --> 03:42:48.720 align:start position:0%
140,000 um we have we are now going to
 
03:42:50.590 --> 03:42:50.600 align:start position:0%
pay for all of the copiers for the
 
03:42:53.990 --> 03:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
Department out of our accounting unit um
 
03:42:57.590 --> 03:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
so they're not budgeted anywhere else so
 
03:42:59.910 --> 03:42:59.920 align:start position:0%
we there are just a few not gonna just
 
03:43:02.790 --> 03:43:02.800 align:start position:0%
create another cost allocation problem
 
03:43:05.269 --> 03:43:05.279 align:start position:0%
Maria it doesn't because those would
 
03:43:09.149 --> 03:43:09.159 align:start position:0%
have been cost allocated um likely
 
03:43:11.429 --> 03:43:11.439 align:start position:0%
across the department already we were
 
03:43:13.510 --> 03:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
just making different areas pay for them
 
03:43:15.070 --> 03:43:15.080 align:start position:0%
and it was creating more admin
 
03:43:18.229 --> 03:43:18.239 align:start position:0%
administrative work than needed to be so
 
03:43:22.149 --> 03:43:22.159 align:start position:0%
we just put them all in one all all here
 
03:43:24.830 --> 03:43:24.840 align:start position:0%
under um
 
03:43:27.309 --> 03:43:27.319 align:start position:0%
Finance so then there's a very slight
 
03:43:29.469 --> 03:43:29.479 align:start position:0%
increase in
 
03:43:34.309 --> 03:43:34.319 align:start position:0%
Personnel we did um the governor's uh we
 
03:43:36.269 --> 03:43:36.279 align:start position:0%
requested in the agency phase and the
 
03:43:39.750 --> 03:43:39.760 align:start position:0%
governor um did approve funding some
 
03:43:41.550 --> 03:43:41.560 align:start position:0%
positions that have previously been
 
03:43:44.750 --> 03:43:44.760 align:start position:0%
unfunded that were unfunded in 20 and 21
 
03:43:47.830 --> 03:43:47.840 align:start position:0%
and agreed to leave some of those funded
 
03:43:51.149 --> 03:43:51.159 align:start position:0%
in 22 and 23 we still do have many
 
03:43:53.550 --> 03:43:53.560 align:start position:0%
unfunded positions but we have funded a
 
03:43:53.560 --> 03:43:54.710 align:start position:0%
unfunded positions but we have funded a
couple

03:43:54.710 --> 03:43:54.720 align:start position:0%
couple
 
03:43:57.309 --> 03:43:57.319 align:start position:0%
more what are the couple do you know off
 
03:44:00.349 --> 03:44:00.359 align:start position:0%
hand I don't know them off the top of my
 
03:44:02.149 --> 03:44:02.159 align:start position:0%
head I think at least one was a
 
03:44:02.159 --> 03:44:03.590 align:start position:0%
head I think at least one was a
contracts

03:44:03.590 --> 03:44:03.600 align:start position:0%
contracts
 
03:44:03.600 --> 03:44:05.269 align:start position:0%
contracts
position

03:44:05.269 --> 03:44:05.279 align:start position:0%
position
 
03:44:08.469 --> 03:44:08.479 align:start position:0%
um I think one was a Medicaid position
 
03:44:10.830 --> 03:44:10.840 align:start position:0%
Medicaid finance a cost allocation
 
03:44:15.149 --> 03:44:15.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:16.750 --> 03:44:16.760 align:start position:0%
I don't know the ex have to cost
 
03:44:20.070 --> 03:44:20.080 align:start position:0%
allocate the cost allocation position we
 
03:44:23.830 --> 03:44:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:23.840 --> 03:44:25.590 align:start position:0%
 
do

03:44:25.590 --> 03:44:25.600 align:start position:0%
do
 
03:44:28.630 --> 03:44:28.640 align:start position:0%
yes are there any questions on business
 
03:44:30.550 --> 03:44:30.560 align:start position:0%
operations and I'm just going to go down
 
03:44:32.349 --> 03:44:32.359 align:start position:0%
to the second page just to mention that
 
03:44:33.870 --> 03:44:33.880 align:start position:0%
this is where you see that other funds
 
03:44:35.229 --> 03:44:35.239 align:start position:0%
that I mentioned in the presentation
 
03:44:39.110 --> 03:44:39.120 align:start position:0%
that's 17 million that's the um cost
 
03:44:41.590 --> 03:44:41.600 align:start position:0%
associated with
 
03:44:48.910 --> 03:44:48.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:52.550 --> 03:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
I think it also is um and Beth correct
 
03:44:54.910 --> 03:44:54.920 align:start position:0%
me if I'm wrong but the face masks that
 
03:44:58.469 --> 03:44:58.479 align:start position:0%
are being sold at the liquor stores is
 
03:45:02.070 --> 03:45:02.080 align:start position:0%
also represented there as well I think
 
03:45:06.630 --> 03:45:06.640 align:start position:0%
which is the that number on my on my
 
03:45:09.110 --> 03:45:09.120 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet um do you know what line
 
03:45:15.469 --> 03:45:15.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:17.710 --> 03:45:17.720 align:start position:0%
so I'm not sure if your spreadsheet
 
03:45:22.429 --> 03:45:22.439 align:start position:0%
has oh I see it I see 17 million in
 
03:45:25.149 --> 03:45:25.159 align:start position:0%
fy20 yes but I'm not seeing anything in
 
03:45:26.550 --> 03:45:26.560 align:start position:0%
the out
 
03:45:29.790 --> 03:45:29.800 align:start position:0%
Years nope because well fiscal year 21
 
03:45:32.550 --> 03:45:32.560 align:start position:0%
is just the adjusted authorized budget
 
03:45:34.910 --> 03:45:34.920 align:start position:0%
which at that time we had not adjusted
 
03:45:37.870 --> 03:45:37.880 align:start position:0%
the budget yet for um when this was
 
03:45:42.429 --> 03:45:42.439 align:start position:0%
loaded in August we had not yet added
 
03:45:45.389 --> 03:45:45.399 align:start position:0%
the funds for the VA um transaction that
 
03:45:47.429 --> 03:45:47.439 align:start position:0%
we've done this year in fiscal year 21
 
03:45:50.630 --> 03:45:50.640 align:start position:0%
and I hope that by fiscal year 22 the VA
 
03:45:54.110 --> 03:45:54.120 align:start position:0%
will will be able to procure their own
 
03:45:54.120 --> 03:45:55.790 align:start position:0%
will will be able to procure their own
PPE

03:45:55.790 --> 03:45:55.800 align:start position:0%
PPE
 
03:46:00.510 --> 03:46:00.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:03.950 --> 03:46:03.960 align:start position:0%
hope well good the veterans thank you
 
03:46:06.790 --> 03:46:06.800 align:start position:0%
for and the governor for
 
03:46:10.070 --> 03:46:10.080 align:start position:0%
helping you're welcome are there any
 
03:46:12.910 --> 03:46:12.920 align:start position:0%
questions for on office of business
 
03:46:12.920 --> 03:46:18.189 align:start position:0%
questions for on office of business
operations

03:46:18.189 --> 03:46:18.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:21.469 --> 03:46:21.479 align:start position:0%
okay the next accounting unit is
 
03:46:24.389 --> 03:46:24.399 align:start position:0%
8137 which is workman's
 
03:46:27.510 --> 03:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
compensation uh this is workman's comp
 
03:46:30.389 --> 03:46:30.399 align:start position:0%
across the department with the exception
 
03:46:33.149 --> 03:46:33.159 align:start position:0%
of the facilities we did keep the
 
03:46:35.149 --> 03:46:35.159 align:start position:0%
facilities workman's comp within the
 
03:46:38.550 --> 03:46:38.560 align:start position:0%
facilities budget because of the unique
 
03:46:40.189 --> 03:46:40.199 align:start position:0%
nature of the workman's comp that
 
03:46:41.910 --> 03:46:41.920 align:start position:0%
generally happens in the facilities we
 
03:46:44.309 --> 03:46:44.319 align:start position:0%
wanted to keep that with them um but the
 
03:46:45.750 --> 03:46:45.760 align:start position:0%
workman's comp for the rest of the
 
03:46:49.830 --> 03:46:49.840 align:start position:0%
department is is here in
 
03:46:52.070 --> 03:46:52.080 align:start position:0%
8137 and that's what the slight increase
 
03:46:54.030 --> 03:46:54.040 align:start position:0%
is a couple of areas did budget their
 
03:46:56.269 --> 03:46:56.279 align:start position:0%
own workman's comp and we put it all
 
03:46:59.189 --> 03:46:59.199 align:start position:0%
into one accounting unit so is that why
 
03:47:02.110 --> 03:47:02.120 align:start position:0%
it goes up 41% because it's just got
 
03:47:05.670 --> 03:47:05.680 align:start position:0%
more accounting units this time around
 
03:47:07.870 --> 03:47:07.880 align:start position:0%
exactly there was a couple of areas that
 
03:47:10.630 --> 03:47:10.640 align:start position:0%
would do like a you know a $30,000
 
03:47:12.670 --> 03:47:12.680 align:start position:0%
workman's comp budget and we decided
 
03:47:14.389 --> 03:47:14.399 align:start position:0%
that that was more administrative work
 
03:47:18.110 --> 03:47:18.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:21.790 --> 03:47:21.800 align:start position:0%
necessary questions about workerman comp
 
03:47:24.670 --> 03:47:24.680 align:start position:0%
all right let's
 
03:47:29.389 --> 03:47:29.399 align:start position:0%
go and then uh 8584 is
 
03:47:31.630 --> 03:47:31.640 align:start position:0%
unemployment that's pretty much level
 
03:47:34.670 --> 03:47:34.680 align:start position:0%
funded uh with level funded to the
 
03:47:39.790 --> 03:47:39.800 align:start position:0%
actuals in fiscal year um 20 it it is
 
03:47:41.510 --> 03:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
higher than what was budgeted in fiscal
 
03:47:47.670 --> 03:47:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:51.630 --> 03:47:51.640 align:start position:0%
okay so it's budgeted at the fy20 actual
 
03:47:58.030 --> 03:47:58.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:03.870 --> 03:48:03.880 align:start position:0%
right okay um the next one is
 
03:48:07.309 --> 03:48:07.319 align:start position:0%
7208 which is minority health and
 
03:48:09.309 --> 03:48:09.319 align:start position:0%
Refugee Affairs which you heard about
 
03:48:09.319 --> 03:48:11.149 align:start position:0%
Refugee Affairs which you heard about
this

03:48:11.149 --> 03:48:11.159 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:48:16.429 --> 03:48:16.439 align:start position:0%
morning say that number again 72
 
03:48:16.439 --> 03:48:19.550 align:start position:0%
morning say that number again 72
8

03:48:19.550 --> 03:48:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:21.990 --> 03:48:22.000 align:start position:0%
7208 Karen I don't think we have Ann I
 
03:48:24.229 --> 03:48:24.239 align:start position:0%
think she's still on the other side oh
 
03:48:35.510 --> 03:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:39.870 --> 03:48:39.880 align:start position:0%
over federal funds are dropping here but
 
03:48:42.630 --> 03:48:42.640 align:start position:0%
we're expecting an increase in clients
 
03:48:47.630 --> 03:48:47.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:49.790 --> 03:48:49.800 align:start position:0%
Beth can you speak I don't know that
 
03:48:51.389 --> 03:48:51.399 align:start position:0%
Beth can speak to the increase in
 
03:48:53.389 --> 03:48:53.399 align:start position:0%
clients but Beth can you speak to the
 
03:48:56.349 --> 03:48:56.359 align:start position:0%
the general fund Federal fund split here
 
03:48:59.389 --> 03:48:59.399 align:start position:0%
I can because um
 
03:49:02.349 --> 03:49:02.359 align:start position:0%
the um language Bank
 
03:49:06.950 --> 03:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
contract came into o from
 
03:49:10.469 --> 03:49:10.479 align:start position:0%
BFA so on a whole it used to be that
 
03:49:13.389 --> 03:49:13.399 align:start position:0%
Health Equity would have had a higher
 
03:49:16.750 --> 03:49:16.760 align:start position:0%
Federal fund fund ratio but due to the
 
03:49:19.149 --> 03:49:19.159 align:start position:0%
language Bank having more General
 
03:49:22.110 --> 03:49:22.120 align:start position:0%
funds than federal funds it's going to
 
03:49:25.269 --> 03:49:25.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:27.910 --> 03:49:27.920 align:start position:0%
total okay but overall the Department's
 
03:49:29.910 --> 03:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
getting the same amount of federal funds
 
03:49:31.630 --> 03:49:31.640 align:start position:0%
it's just being put into different
 
03:49:35.229 --> 03:49:35.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:35.239 --> 03:49:36.910 align:start position:0%
 
right

03:49:36.910 --> 03:49:36.920 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:49:40.149 --> 03:49:40.159 align:start position:0%
yes yes
 
03:49:43.269 --> 03:49:43.279 align:start position:0%
yes okay and then we we draw every
 
03:49:49.070 --> 03:49:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:51.830 --> 03:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
that our general
 
03:49:55.590 --> 03:49:55.600 align:start position:0%
fund is going up 47%
 
03:49:58.830 --> 03:49:58.840 align:start position:0%
about I believe that's the language back
 
03:50:01.429 --> 03:50:01.439 align:start position:0%
language Bank contract that Beth was
 
03:50:04.429 --> 03:50:04.439 align:start position:0%
just speaking to now did I hear right
 
03:50:07.590 --> 03:50:07.600 align:start position:0%
that the only language that we're really
 
03:50:10.990 --> 03:50:11.000 align:start position:0%
emphasizing is Spanish though I mean or
 
03:50:15.389 --> 03:50:15.399 align:start position:0%
or do we still need to do a lot of Edge
 
03:50:20.429 --> 03:50:20.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:23.710 --> 03:50:23.720 align:start position:0%
documents hi this is Ann thank you for
 
03:50:25.950 --> 03:50:25.960 align:start position:0%
that question I'm gonna ask Anella to
 
03:50:29.309 --> 03:50:29.319 align:start position:0%
clarify again just because she has all
 
03:50:30.990 --> 03:50:31.000 align:start position:0%
of the
 
03:50:33.790 --> 03:50:33.800 align:start position:0%
knowledge I just remember that most of
 
03:50:36.030 --> 03:50:36.040 align:start position:0%
it is Spanish but it didn't sound like
 
03:50:38.630 --> 03:50:38.640 align:start position:0%
that was all of it
 
03:50:42.189 --> 03:50:42.199 align:start position:0%
certainly so um thank you representative
 
03:50:45.070 --> 03:50:45.080 align:start position:0%
Edwards um so for the vital document we
 
03:50:47.990 --> 03:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
mean applications to services so those
 
03:50:50.830 --> 03:50:50.840 align:start position:0%
are mostly done in Spanish however we
 
03:50:53.750 --> 03:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
work closely with um office of refugee
 
03:50:55.670 --> 03:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
resettlement and we look into the
 
03:50:58.710 --> 03:50:58.720 align:start position:0%
language needs in certain
 
03:51:01.670 --> 03:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
populations um um and um district
 
03:51:05.149 --> 03:51:05.159 align:start position:0%
offices and we try to have forms
 
03:51:07.429 --> 03:51:07.439 align:start position:0%
tailored into those languages that are
 
03:51:10.510 --> 03:51:10.520 align:start position:0%
actually being resettled in the areas so
 
03:51:13.469 --> 03:51:13.479 align:start position:0%
in the past when uh Vietnamese refugees
 
03:51:16.189 --> 03:51:16.199 align:start position:0%
were coming we would get um also
 
03:51:17.870 --> 03:51:17.880 align:start position:0%
Vietnamese language in addition to
 
03:51:20.349 --> 03:51:20.359 align:start position:0%
Spanish then we had bosnians and
 
03:51:22.550 --> 03:51:22.560 align:start position:0%
Sudanese so those will be the languages
 
03:51:25.429 --> 03:51:25.439 align:start position:0%
that we will translate currently it's
 
03:51:28.830 --> 03:51:28.840 align:start position:0%
Swahili uh kinanda and kirundi because
 
03:51:30.269 --> 03:51:30.279 align:start position:0%
those are the groups that come from
 
03:51:33.349 --> 03:51:33.359 align:start position:0%
Democratic Republic of Congo um so we
 
03:51:35.950 --> 03:51:35.960 align:start position:0%
try to work with the department needs
 
03:51:38.030 --> 03:51:38.040 align:start position:0%
and make sure that the vital documents
 
03:51:41.030 --> 03:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
are available into those predominantly
 
03:51:44.750 --> 03:51:44.760 align:start position:0%
High utilization languages so so thank
 
03:51:46.710 --> 03:51:46.720 align:start position:0%
you for all of that those are vital
 
03:51:48.830 --> 03:51:48.840 align:start position:0%
Services I'm I'm glad you're working on
 
03:51:51.349 --> 03:51:51.359 align:start position:0%
it I I'm just I'm just doing some
 
03:51:55.030 --> 03:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
accounting here there's a a line called
 
03:51:58.070 --> 03:51:58.080 align:start position:0%
contracts for program Services which
 
03:52:00.630 --> 03:52:00.640 align:start position:0%
sounds like would be the language bank
 
03:52:03.309 --> 03:52:03.319 align:start position:0%
money and it goes up about
 
03:52:06.830 --> 03:52:06.840 align:start position:0%
97,000 but for the overall General funds
 
03:52:08.910 --> 03:52:08.920 align:start position:0%
it's going up
 
03:52:11.830 --> 03:52:11.840 align:start position:0%
34,000 so the language Bank looks like
 
03:52:14.630 --> 03:52:14.640 align:start position:0%
it's accounting for about a third of the
 
03:52:16.710 --> 03:52:16.720 align:start position:0%
plus up in the general
 
03:52:19.349 --> 03:52:19.359 align:start position:0%
fund and I'm just curious if I'm
 
03:52:22.030 --> 03:52:22.040 align:start position:0%
interpreting that right and if I am
 
03:52:24.189 --> 03:52:24.199 align:start position:0%
where's where's the other two3 what's
 
03:52:24.199 --> 03:52:25.630 align:start position:0%
where's where's the other two3 what's
going

03:52:25.630 --> 03:52:25.640 align:start position:0%
going
 
03:52:29.389 --> 03:52:29.399 align:start position:0%
on it's benefits
 
03:52:34.269 --> 03:52:34.279 align:start position:0%
maybe and personal
 
03:52:36.950 --> 03:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
services okay all
 
03:52:40.790 --> 03:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
right so does that look right to you uh
 
03:52:43.630 --> 03:52:43.640 align:start position:0%
C I'm I'm not going to do your name well
 
03:52:45.990 --> 03:52:46.000 align:start position:0%
miss cruche
 
03:52:50.950 --> 03:52:50.960 align:start position:0%
crucia thank you um yes so the office of
 
03:52:52.630 --> 03:52:52.640 align:start position:0%
Health Equity didn't have the
 
03:52:55.189 --> 03:52:55.199 align:start position:0%
communication access contract within our
 
03:52:57.590 --> 03:52:57.600 align:start position:0%
office when that moved our budget
 
03:53:00.110 --> 03:53:00.120 align:start position:0%
certainly looks different I think this
 
03:53:02.030 --> 03:53:02.040 align:start position:0%
is the first time that office the
 
03:53:04.229 --> 03:53:04.239 align:start position:0%
finance committee can see the difference
 
03:53:07.349 --> 03:53:07.359 align:start position:0%
when it moved from Bureau of family
 
03:53:10.349 --> 03:53:10.359 align:start position:0%
assistance I do believe that's the only
 
03:53:12.990 --> 03:53:13.000 align:start position:0%
change I don't think it's associated
 
03:53:17.030 --> 03:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:19.670 --> 03:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
say thank you for that are there any
 
03:53:23.990 --> 03:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
other questions about this line item so
 
03:53:26.750 --> 03:53:26.760 align:start position:0%
so just out of curiosity you're you're
 
03:53:30.670 --> 03:53:30.680 align:start position:0%
you're you're refer Folks at DHHS are
 
03:53:33.870 --> 03:53:33.880 align:start position:0%
referring to this is is the office of
 
03:53:37.030 --> 03:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
equity is there a point where the the
 
03:53:39.269 --> 03:53:39.279 align:start position:0%
name in the spreadsheet is going to
 
03:53:42.309 --> 03:53:42.319 align:start position:0%
change and and what's required to make
 
03:53:44.550 --> 03:53:44.560 align:start position:0%
that happen
 
03:53:47.590 --> 03:53:47.600 align:start position:0%
it's a good question so
 
03:53:51.429 --> 03:53:51.439 align:start position:0%
um we um we do have the ability to
 
03:53:55.389 --> 03:53:55.399 align:start position:0%
change the names of accounting units but
 
03:53:57.030 --> 03:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes uh Department of
 
03:53:59.110 --> 03:53:59.120 align:start position:0%
administrative Services decides that the
 
03:54:02.990 --> 03:54:03.000 align:start position:0%
change is uh such a different name that
 
03:54:05.469 --> 03:54:05.479 align:start position:0%
it requires putting it in an entirely
 
03:54:07.429 --> 03:54:07.439 align:start position:0%
different accounting unit which then
 
03:54:09.830 --> 03:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
means that you start to lose the history
 
03:54:12.309 --> 03:54:12.319 align:start position:0%
of that accounting unit so we're very
 
03:54:14.149 --> 03:54:14.159 align:start position:0%
careful about when we actually make
 
03:54:16.070 --> 03:54:16.080 align:start position:0%
those changes to make sure that they're
 
03:54:18.710 --> 03:54:18.720 align:start position:0%
permanent long-term changes because
 
03:54:21.510 --> 03:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
otherwise we could go bium to bium as
 
03:54:23.269 --> 03:54:23.279 align:start position:0%
those who have been on the committee a
 
03:54:25.710 --> 03:54:25.720 align:start position:0%
long time now and end up moving things
 
03:54:28.389 --> 03:54:28.399 align:start position:0%
back and forth and creating um more
 
03:54:31.429 --> 03:54:31.439 align:start position:0%
confusion so we do regularly try to
 
03:54:34.750 --> 03:54:34.760 align:start position:0%
update those um but
 
03:54:37.510 --> 03:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
uh sometimes we leave them at the older
 
03:54:41.030 --> 03:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
names and just explain why it's an older
 
03:54:45.349 --> 03:54:45.359 align:start position:0%
name sure okay so I I'm I'm I'm anti
 
03:54:48.750 --> 03:54:48.760 align:start position:0%
chaos I like I like that I like having
 
03:54:53.950 --> 03:54:53.960 align:start position:0%
historical yeah so um but I'm also
 
03:54:56.229 --> 03:54:56.239 align:start position:0%
conventional enough to want the names to
 
03:54:58.349 --> 03:54:58.359 align:start position:0%
match that if we're going to call
 
03:55:00.590 --> 03:55:00.600 align:start position:0%
ourselves one thing it should be that
 
03:55:03.590 --> 03:55:03.600 align:start position:0%
way everywhere but but that's that's a
 
03:55:07.349 --> 03:55:07.359 align:start position:0%
that's an operational problem I would um
 
03:55:09.550 --> 03:55:09.560 align:start position:0%
I I can certainly talk chat with Kevin
 
03:55:11.469 --> 03:55:11.479 align:start position:0%
too I don't know what the history has
 
03:55:13.349 --> 03:55:13.359 align:start position:0%
been as far as changing the names in the
 
03:55:15.630 --> 03:55:15.640 align:start position:0%
legislative po process to know if that's
 
03:55:18.790 --> 03:55:18.800 align:start position:0%
a possibility um but I I will have that
 
03:55:20.469 --> 03:55:20.479 align:start position:0%
conversation with him and with
 
03:55:22.870 --> 03:55:22.880 align:start position:0%
administrative services and and see what
 
03:55:25.349 --> 03:55:25.359 align:start position:0%
that would look like yeah and just so
 
03:55:27.630 --> 03:55:27.640 align:start position:0%
you know why I I mean I'm trainable
 
03:55:29.910 --> 03:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
everyone on this call now understands
 
03:55:32.790 --> 03:55:32.800 align:start position:0%
exactly what you guys have done um but
 
03:55:36.030 --> 03:55:36.040 align:start position:0%
for public transparency into the budget
 
03:55:38.830 --> 03:55:38.840 align:start position:0%
I I just I just think we we should have
 
03:55:41.429 --> 03:55:41.439 align:start position:0%
consistent naming so that the public
 
03:55:44.750 --> 03:55:44.760 align:start position:0%
knows what we're doing I understand and
 
03:55:47.910 --> 03:55:47.920 align:start position:0%
totally appreciate that all right so so
 
03:55:50.469 --> 03:55:50.479 align:start position:0%
is the next one Refugee
 
03:55:54.469 --> 03:55:54.479 align:start position:0%
Services is that the next one down yes
 
03:56:01.149 --> 03:56:01.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:03.670 --> 03:56:03.680 align:start position:0%
7209 and that quick
 
03:56:06.429 --> 03:56:06.439 align:start position:0%
question yes uh yes I didn't I'm sorry I
 
03:56:08.349 --> 03:56:08.359 align:start position:0%
didn't see your hand go ahead repres
 
03:56:11.510 --> 03:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
okay Karen is it is there some way to
 
03:56:13.670 --> 03:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
determine the ordering of the
 
03:56:15.469 --> 03:56:15.479 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet to the ordering in the book
 
03:56:16.510 --> 03:56:16.520 align:start position:0%
you're looking at because they're not in
 
03:56:18.269 --> 03:56:18.279 align:start position:0%
the same order there something that
 
03:56:20.269 --> 03:56:20.279 align:start position:0%
would help me map them like alphabet
 
03:56:22.750 --> 03:56:22.760 align:start position:0%
alization or something
 
03:56:26.309 --> 03:56:26.319 align:start position:0%
else I do not have an answer to why the
 
03:56:28.990 --> 03:56:29.000 align:start position:0%
order is the way it is okay so they're
 
03:56:31.269 --> 03:56:31.279 align:start position:0%
put out different totally different ways
 
03:56:34.469 --> 03:56:34.479 align:start position:0%
basically um I that would definitely be
 
03:56:36.349 --> 03:56:36.359 align:start position:0%
an administrative Services question I do
 
03:56:38.429 --> 03:56:38.439 align:start position:0%
not know okay
 
03:56:42.429 --> 03:56:42.439 align:start position:0%
thanks so this is 100% Federal funded is
 
03:56:45.590 --> 03:56:45.600 align:start position:0%
that right this this area Refugee
 
03:56:49.309 --> 03:56:49.319 align:start position:0%
Services it is yes and are we calling
 
03:56:52.349 --> 03:56:52.359 align:start position:0%
this Equity now too or is this remaining
 
03:56:55.630 --> 03:56:55.640 align:start position:0%
Refugee Services th this is part of the
 
03:56:59.469 --> 03:56:59.479 align:start position:0%
office of Health Equity yes okay but
 
03:57:02.870 --> 03:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
this is a smart guy tell me never change
 
03:57:06.149 --> 03:57:06.159 align:start position:0%
the name as long as they're funding
 
03:57:08.870 --> 03:57:08.880 align:start position:0%
it um but yes this is the refugee
 
03:57:11.349 --> 03:57:11.359 align:start position:0%
Services Grant um that is part of the
 
03:57:14.830 --> 03:57:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:17.189 --> 03:57:17.199 align:start position:0%
the opposite was true is if they stop
 
03:57:20.790 --> 03:57:20.800 align:start position:0%
funding it you need to change the
 
03:57:24.389 --> 03:57:24.399 align:start position:0%
name um I try not to use to use tricks
 
03:57:29.229 --> 03:57:29.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:32.910 --> 03:57:32.920 align:start position:0%
it all right so
 
03:57:35.790 --> 03:57:35.800 align:start position:0%
um so then I think so since this is not
 
03:57:37.670 --> 03:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
our money I don't know if we're asking a
 
03:57:39.750 --> 03:57:39.760 align:start position:0%
lot of questions on this
 
03:57:43.229 --> 03:57:43.239 align:start position:0%
section um I assume it's all well
 
03:57:45.830 --> 03:57:45.840 align:start position:0%
managed and no
 
03:57:48.030 --> 03:57:48.040 align:start position:0%
problems that is my understanding I do
 
03:57:50.550 --> 03:57:50.560 align:start position:0%
not know of any issues in that
 
03:57:54.710 --> 03:57:54.720 align:start position:0%
area so then um I'm just pulling up back
 
03:57:54.720 --> 03:57:55.950 align:start position:0%
area so then um I'm just pulling up back
to

03:57:55.950 --> 03:57:55.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:58:00.590 --> 03:58:00.600 align:start position:0%
the the spreadsheet that shows um all of
 
03:58:02.950 --> 03:58:02.960 align:start position:0%
the oom accounting units so the other
 
03:58:04.670 --> 03:58:04.680 align:start position:0%
ones that we talked about tomorrow are
 
03:58:06.269 --> 03:58:06.279 align:start position:0%
here highlighted in green so we're going
 
03:58:07.790 --> 03:58:07.800 align:start position:0%
to jump ahead to
 
03:58:18.189 --> 03:58:18.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:21.110 --> 03:58:21.120 align:start position:0%
okay Bureau of human Affair or human
 
03:58:30.510 --> 03:58:30.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:42.550 --> 03:58:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:44.710 --> 03:58:44.720 align:start position:0%
constant this is where
 
03:58:47.070 --> 03:58:47.080 align:start position:0%
um a as Deputy Commissioner Weaver
 
03:58:49.670 --> 03:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier we do budget a lot of
 
03:58:52.309 --> 03:58:52.319 align:start position:0%
the training for the Department which is
 
03:59:09.389 --> 03:59:09.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:12.269 --> 03:59:12.279 align:start position:0%
66 I I don't have any questions here
 
03:59:14.189 --> 03:59:14.199 align:start position:0%
does anyone on the committee have
 
03:59:21.070 --> 03:59:21.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:23.269 --> 03:59:23.279 align:start position:0%
Resources seeing
 
03:59:25.550 --> 03:59:25.560 align:start position:0%
none what's
 
03:59:28.990 --> 03:59:29.000 align:start position:0%
next the next one is 5685 which is
 
03:59:32.550 --> 03:59:32.560 align:start position:0%
management support this is uh one of the
 
03:59:32.560 --> 03:59:34.070 align:start position:0%
management support this is uh one of the
facilities

03:59:34.070 --> 03:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
03:59:36.469 --> 03:59:36.479 align:start position:0%
um accounting
 
03:59:45.149 --> 03:59:45.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:48.070 --> 03:59:48.080 align:start position:0%
this one the general fund's going up
 
03:59:50.550 --> 03:59:50.560 align:start position:0%
29% $3
 
03:59:53.990 --> 03:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
million say that again I'm sorry so I'm
 
03:59:56.070 --> 03:59:56.080 align:start position:0%
sorry I probably had my hand over my
 
04:00:00.149 --> 04:00:00.159 align:start position:0%
mouth I uh this one is going up 29% or
 
04:00:03.229 --> 04:00:03.239 align:start position:0%
over $3 million on the general
 
04:00:07.990 --> 04:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
funds so uh what's going on here this is
 
04:00:11.910 --> 04:00:11.920 align:start position:0%
a pretty big jump a material one so part
 
04:00:14.710 --> 04:00:14.720 align:start position:0%
of the increase is class line 28 which
 
04:00:17.710 --> 04:00:17.720 align:start position:0%
is transfer to General services that is
 
04:00:17.720 --> 04:00:19.870 align:start position:0%
is transfer to General services that is
increasing

04:00:19.870 --> 04:00:19.880 align:start position:0%
increasing
 
04:00:23.670 --> 04:00:23.680 align:start position:0%
$400,000 um that is one of the larger
 
04:00:27.910 --> 04:00:27.920 align:start position:0%
increases um there's also uh class line
 
04:00:32.110 --> 04:00:32.120 align:start position:0%
48 um which did not have any cost in
 
04:00:35.590 --> 04:00:35.600 align:start position:0%
20 um that is going
 
04:00:39.710 --> 04:00:39.720 align:start position:0%
up and so Dave and Beth Dave clab could
 
04:00:41.830 --> 04:00:41.840 align:start position:0%
you speak a little bit to the increases
 
04:00:43.670 --> 04:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
and then Beth maybe you can add a little
 
04:00:49.070 --> 04:00:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:53.469 --> 04:00:53.479 align:start position:0%
piece um one of the increases were was
 
04:00:58.070 --> 04:00:58.080 align:start position:0%
the uh transfer to D maintenance for
 
04:01:01.189 --> 04:01:01.199 align:start position:0%
future maintenance projects that's based
 
04:01:04.189 --> 04:01:04.199 align:start position:0%
against their square footage cost and I
 
04:01:05.950 --> 04:01:05.960 align:start position:0%
forget what the actual dollar value
 
04:01:08.349 --> 04:01:08.359 align:start position:0%
would they use per square
 
04:01:12.550 --> 04:01:12.560 align:start position:0%
foot um water and electricity uh we're
 
04:01:16.710 --> 04:01:16.720 align:start position:0%
actually taking a drop from from um this
 
04:01:19.229 --> 04:01:19.239 align:start position:0%
fiscal year into the next fiscal year
 
04:01:21.070 --> 04:01:21.080 align:start position:0%
we've done a lot of there's been a lot
 
04:01:23.750 --> 04:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
of energy improvements that we're going
 
04:01:27.630 --> 04:01:27.640 align:start position:0%
through to try to keep them um operating
 
04:01:30.309 --> 04:01:30.319 align:start position:0%
as efficiently as
 
04:01:32.030 --> 04:01:32.040 align:start position:0%
possible uh
 
04:01:34.750 --> 04:01:34.760 align:start position:0%
telecommunications the that's some cell
 
04:01:38.110 --> 04:01:38.120 align:start position:0%
phones and so forth
 
04:01:41.469 --> 04:01:41.479 align:start position:0%
um because most of the uh phones have
 
04:01:44.189 --> 04:01:44.199 align:start position:0%
been transferred over to the other that
 
04:01:46.189 --> 04:01:46.199 align:start position:0%
we spoke about
 
04:01:49.070 --> 04:01:49.080 align:start position:0%
earlier one that jumps out at me is the
 
04:01:53.110 --> 04:01:53.120 align:start position:0%
rents leases other than State going from
 
04:02:12.830 --> 04:02:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:17.309 --> 04:02:17.319 align:start position:0%
888,246 district office so okay so so
 
04:02:20.189 --> 04:02:20.199 align:start position:0%
let me let me ask you uh a question
 
04:02:21.910 --> 04:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
related to what's going on in the
 
04:02:24.389 --> 04:02:24.399 align:start position:0%
corporate world I I I hear corporations
 
04:02:27.950 --> 04:02:27.960 align:start position:0%
are trying to use the fact that they've
 
04:02:30.670 --> 04:02:30.680 align:start position:0%
downsized their people through
 
04:02:33.149 --> 04:02:33.159 align:start position:0%
telecommuting so much that they're
 
04:02:35.790 --> 04:02:35.800 align:start position:0%
aggressively renegotiating the amount of
 
04:02:39.229 --> 04:02:39.239 align:start position:0%
rental space they need and so Corporate
 
04:02:43.309 --> 04:02:43.319 align:start position:0%
America is cutting their rents uh now I
 
04:02:46.189 --> 04:02:46.199 align:start position:0%
believe and so ours are going up a lot
 
04:02:49.229 --> 04:02:49.239 align:start position:0%
and I'm just curious if if maybe there's
 
04:02:52.469 --> 04:02:52.479 align:start position:0%
an opportunity here for us to make some
 
04:02:56.269 --> 04:02:56.279 align:start position:0%
money and reduce our
 
04:03:00.110 --> 04:03:00.120 align:start position:0%
rents we always go up for RFP and we go
 
04:03:04.030 --> 04:03:04.040 align:start position:0%
for the best uh price that we can get uh
 
04:03:05.870 --> 04:03:05.880 align:start position:0%
for a rent uh
 
04:03:09.309 --> 04:03:09.319 align:start position:0%
figure so we've always address that the
 
04:03:11.990 --> 04:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
unit the the ones that we're having to
 
04:03:14.910 --> 04:03:14.920 align:start position:0%
address the three District offices do
 
04:03:19.189 --> 04:03:19.199 align:start position:0%
have are older and the leases are at the
 
04:03:22.550 --> 04:03:22.560 align:start position:0%
end of their um time so they were a
 
04:03:25.149 --> 04:03:25.159 align:start position:0%
10year lease when we got them and we're
 
04:03:27.950 --> 04:03:27.960 align:start position:0%
g to try to reduce the
 
04:03:30.830 --> 04:03:30.840 align:start position:0%
space as much as we can but we we're
 
04:03:33.630 --> 04:03:33.640 align:start position:0%
still working on what the numbers are uh
 
04:03:36.189 --> 04:03:36.199 align:start position:0%
that are coming back representative
 
04:03:39.870 --> 04:03:39.880 align:start position:0%
Rogers has her hand up you're recognized
 
04:03:43.469 --> 04:03:43.479 align:start position:0%
yes um Karen answer this and if this is
 
04:03:45.710 --> 04:03:45.720 align:start position:0%
the but I remember in the last budget we
 
04:03:47.429 --> 04:03:47.439 align:start position:0%
had a whole rigal we talked about I
 
04:03:50.349 --> 04:03:50.359 align:start position:0%
think the Rochester office and we went
 
04:03:53.590 --> 04:03:53.600 align:start position:0%
back and forth about um space that we
 
04:03:56.229 --> 04:03:56.239 align:start position:0%
were getting from the city then we
 
04:03:57.590 --> 04:03:57.600 align:start position:0%
weren't getting it then we were looking
 
04:03:59.830 --> 04:03:59.840 align:start position:0%
at new space and I wondered has that
 
04:04:01.590 --> 04:04:01.600 align:start position:0%
been resolved is that still one of the
 
04:04:03.830 --> 04:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
ones we're negotiating where does that
 
04:04:05.830 --> 04:04:05.840 align:start position:0%
stand and what's going on with that rent
 
04:04:09.030 --> 04:04:09.040 align:start position:0%
or that lease that has not been resolved
 
04:04:10.630 --> 04:04:10.640 align:start position:0%
at this
 
04:04:13.030 --> 04:04:13.040 align:start position:0%
time so where do we stand what's
 
04:04:13.040 --> 04:04:14.269 align:start position:0%
time so where do we stand what's
happening

04:04:14.269 --> 04:04:14.279 align:start position:0%
happening
 
04:04:16.550 --> 04:04:16.560 align:start position:0%
uh we're actually filing for a twoyear
 
04:04:19.030 --> 04:04:19.040 align:start position:0%
exension to allow us to
 
04:04:22.750 --> 04:04:22.760 align:start position:0%
re-evaluate um the office and any
 
04:04:26.070 --> 04:04:26.080 align:start position:0%
um potential new locations that we can
 
04:04:32.550 --> 04:04:32.560 align:start position:0%
go to um the city was not happy in that
 
04:04:34.990 --> 04:04:35.000 align:start position:0%
the the standard has changed for
 
04:04:39.670 --> 04:04:39.680 align:start position:0%
district offices considerably so the
 
04:04:42.910 --> 04:04:42.920 align:start position:0%
we've been there for almost 20 years and
 
04:04:46.590 --> 04:04:46.600 align:start position:0%
um it didn't the safeguards put in place
 
04:04:49.429 --> 04:04:49.439 align:start position:0%
and the meeting space for uh to meet
 
04:04:52.110 --> 04:04:52.120 align:start position:0%
with clients was below standard and
 
04:04:55.269 --> 04:04:55.279 align:start position:0%
doesn't meet Ada um accessibility
 
04:05:00.030 --> 04:05:00.040 align:start position:0%
standards if I could follow up please um
 
04:05:02.149 --> 04:05:02.159 align:start position:0%
I think would it be possible for you to
 
04:05:05.550 --> 04:05:05.560 align:start position:0%
maybe get to us a um recap from I think
 
04:05:07.710 --> 04:05:07.720 align:start position:0%
I have my paperwork somewhere but it
 
04:05:09.830 --> 04:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
would be easier Kevin um if maybe you
 
04:05:12.429 --> 04:05:12.439 align:start position:0%
could get to us the recap of where we
 
04:05:14.910 --> 04:05:14.920 align:start position:0%
stood two years ago
 
04:05:17.389 --> 04:05:17.399 align:start position:0%
with some of that material and bring us
 
04:05:20.149 --> 04:05:20.159 align:start position:0%
up to date with a brief memo of what's
 
04:05:21.910 --> 04:05:21.920 align:start position:0%
going on over there and and where we
 
04:05:24.910 --> 04:05:24.920 align:start position:0%
stand would be helpful yep sure I can do
 
04:05:28.670 --> 04:05:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:32.990 --> 04:05:33.000 align:start position:0%
much so so do is that all your questions
 
04:05:34.469 --> 04:05:34.479 align:start position:0%
representative Rogers I don't want to
 
04:05:36.990 --> 04:05:37.000 align:start position:0%
stop you thank you very much you're very
 
04:05:39.670 --> 04:05:39.680 align:start position:0%
welcome so Mr clap I'm now looking at
 
04:05:43.070 --> 04:05:43.080 align:start position:0%
the transfers to General Services that's
 
04:05:48.070 --> 04:05:48.080 align:start position:0%
up about 885,000 on average 15%
 
04:05:52.070 --> 04:05:52.080 align:start position:0%
increase yes that's dictated To Us by uh
 
04:05:56.229 --> 04:05:56.239 align:start position:0%
Das um they have a group uh Bureau of
 
04:05:58.910 --> 04:05:58.920 align:start position:0%
facilities and assets management that's
 
04:06:02.590 --> 04:06:02.600 align:start position:0%
supposed to manage the properties on the
 
04:06:06.030 --> 04:06:06.040 align:start position:0%
Sops campus off of uh Pleasant Street
 
04:06:08.710 --> 04:06:08.720 align:start position:0%
and they dictate what the costs are that
 
04:06:11.950 --> 04:06:11.960 align:start position:0%
we're we're giving
 
04:06:15.309 --> 04:06:15.319 align:start position:0%
them so so I'm I'm just going to say it
 
04:06:18.189 --> 04:06:18.199 align:start position:0%
back to see if I heard you right that
 
04:06:19.510 --> 04:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
that this is
 
04:06:22.910 --> 04:06:22.920 align:start position:0%
essentially a a a contract that we're
 
04:06:25.710 --> 04:06:25.720 align:start position:0%
paying for so that they maintain our
 
04:06:27.950 --> 04:06:27.960 align:start position:0%
buildings on a
 
04:06:30.670 --> 04:06:30.680 align:start position:0%
campus yes it's similar to paying the
 
04:06:33.950 --> 04:06:33.960 align:start position:0%
rent they basically take their expenses
 
04:06:36.590 --> 04:06:36.600 align:start position:0%
for the buildings and the whole campus
 
04:06:41.309 --> 04:06:41.319 align:start position:0%
and um charges for that and is this
 
04:06:43.790 --> 04:06:43.800 align:start position:0%
Federal General services or is this aate
 
04:06:47.110 --> 04:06:47.120 align:start position:0%
General services this is uh the
 
04:06:49.590 --> 04:06:49.600 align:start position:0%
department of administrative Services
 
04:06:51.070 --> 04:06:51.080 align:start position:0%
Bureau of facilities and assets
 
04:06:53.870 --> 04:06:53.880 align:start position:0%
management it's not General
 
04:06:56.110 --> 04:06:56.120 align:start position:0%
Services because it says transfers to
 
04:06:57.910 --> 04:06:57.920 align:start position:0%
General Services I was just wondering if
 
04:07:01.269 --> 04:07:01.279 align:start position:0%
that was a a a federal effort or or if
 
04:07:04.349 --> 04:07:04.359 align:start position:0%
we have our own state level it's the
 
04:07:04.359 --> 04:07:09.670 align:start position:0%
we have our own state level it's the
state

04:07:09.670 --> 04:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:12.189 --> 04:07:12.199 align:start position:0%
level and what would account for that
 
04:07:15.030 --> 04:07:15.040 align:start position:0%
just they're charging us more or because
 
04:07:18.429 --> 04:07:18.439 align:start position:0%
they can or or because uh the buildings
 
04:07:21.550 --> 04:07:21.560 align:start position:0%
are in disrepair and and repair fits
 
04:07:24.950 --> 04:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
within this line the repairs are within
 
04:07:27.910 --> 04:07:27.920 align:start position:0%
that um because of covid a lot of stuff
 
04:07:32.269 --> 04:07:32.279 align:start position:0%
was uh pushed off and now U they've got
 
04:07:34.950 --> 04:07:34.960 align:start position:0%
to catch up the the buildings are old
 
04:07:37.510 --> 04:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
they do need maintenance that has to be
 
04:07:41.229 --> 04:07:41.239 align:start position:0%
addressed so it's it's pretty much just
 
04:07:45.469 --> 04:07:45.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:48.710 --> 04:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
utilized who whose responsibility is it
 
04:07:50.990 --> 04:07:51.000 align:start position:0%
to take a look at our entire building
 
04:07:53.149 --> 04:07:53.159 align:start position:0%
inventory and decide what should just be
 
04:07:55.830 --> 04:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
torn down and built new who who who does
 
04:07:57.550 --> 04:07:57.560 align:start position:0%
who owns that
 
04:08:01.309 --> 04:08:01.319 align:start position:0%
plan that there was a master plan done
 
04:08:03.750 --> 04:08:03.760 align:start position:0%
uh by um admin
 
04:08:07.790 --> 04:08:07.800 align:start position:0%
services and there was some buildings
 
04:08:09.790 --> 04:08:09.800 align:start position:0%
have been slated to be torn down which
 
04:08:12.349 --> 04:08:12.359 align:start position:0%
uh we're in the process of having the
 
04:08:15.510 --> 04:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
Steam Plant demolished um some other
 
04:08:18.710 --> 04:08:18.720 align:start position:0%
buildings were amach to be demolished
 
04:08:21.469 --> 04:08:21.479 align:start position:0%
but we're looking at uh get trying to
 
04:08:23.429 --> 04:08:23.439 align:start position:0%
get them repurposed so that we can have
 
04:08:25.750 --> 04:08:25.760 align:start position:0%
office space that can be used
 
04:08:28.830 --> 04:08:28.840 align:start position:0%
properly so is that within DHHS or is
 
04:08:31.590 --> 04:08:31.600 align:start position:0%
that a state function that's um who does
 
04:08:35.109 --> 04:08:35.119 align:start position:0%
it that is Das Department of
 
04:08:44.870 --> 04:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:46.510 --> 04:08:46.520 align:start position:0%
Kevin which division is Department of
 
04:08:49.750 --> 04:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
administrative Services part
 
04:08:57.830 --> 04:08:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:01.349 --> 04:09:01.359 align:start position:0%
one all right hey thank you Mr clap do
 
04:09:03.670 --> 04:09:03.680 align:start position:0%
you have are are you and Miss rounds
 
04:09:06.950 --> 04:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
going to do another department with
 
04:09:10.229 --> 04:09:10.239 align:start position:0%
us I believe so one more yes the
 
04:09:22.349 --> 04:09:22.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:47.830 --> 04:09:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:50.830 --> 04:09:50.840 align:start position:0%
this is an area where we did um leave
 
04:09:53.630 --> 04:09:53.640 align:start position:0%
the instate travel reimbursement hire
 
04:09:56.030 --> 04:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
because these are people who are
 
04:09:58.389 --> 04:09:58.399 align:start position:0%
traveling to the district offices and
 
04:10:00.229 --> 04:10:00.239 align:start position:0%
helping service them so that that's
 
04:10:03.469 --> 04:10:03.479 align:start position:0%
unlikely to change even with less people
 
04:10:05.030 --> 04:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
in the office as long as the office
 
04:10:07.750 --> 04:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
exists people will have to go to them to
 
04:10:07.760 --> 04:10:11.870 align:start position:0%
exists people will have to go to them to
maintain

04:10:11.870 --> 04:10:11.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:18.189 --> 04:10:18.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:22.590 --> 04:10:22.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:25.830 --> 04:10:25.840 align:start position:0%
section the dhh district office just
 
04:10:28.950 --> 04:10:28.960 align:start position:0%

conquered these are located throughout
 
04:10:37.590 --> 04:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
the state there is one in conquered but
 
04:10:40.990 --> 04:10:41.000 align:start position:0%
it is located throughout the
 
04:10:44.469 --> 04:10:44.479 align:start position:0%
state is Berlin little in
 
04:10:46.670 --> 04:10:46.680 align:start position:0%
Conway uh
 
04:10:49.750 --> 04:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
Rochester uh SE Coast which is in
 
04:10:52.910 --> 04:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth um Southern which is in
 
04:10:57.990 --> 04:10:58.000 align:start position:0%

trivia that houses all the divisions
 
04:11:11.590 --> 04:11:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:14.070 --> 04:11:14.080 align:start position:0%

right thank you thank you okay so that
 
04:11:28.309 --> 04:11:28.319 align:start position:0%
um that concludes all of the accounting
 
04:11:30.070 --> 04:11:30.080 align:start position:0%
units for the presentations that we went
 
04:11:31.590 --> 04:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
over this morning it leaves three
 
04:11:35.670 --> 04:11:35.680 align:start position:0%
accounting units in um in office of the
 
04:11:37.710 --> 04:11:37.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner two which are highlighted
 
04:11:41.750 --> 04:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
here in this uh blue color which are uh
 
04:11:45.389 --> 04:11:45.399 align:start position:0%
Meredith too um and the one in purple
 
04:11:47.229 --> 04:11:47.239 align:start position:0%
which is Bureau of Information
 
04:11:50.510 --> 04:11:50.520 align:start position:0%
Services so I'm gonna go ahead and stop
 
04:11:54.510 --> 04:11:54.520 align:start position:0%
sharing for now um let's talk about
 
04:11:58.950 --> 04:11:58.960 align:start position:0%
tomorrow a little bit um Monday Monday
 
04:12:02.309 --> 04:12:02.319 align:start position:0%
yeah that tomorrow Monday
 
04:12:05.109 --> 04:12:05.119 align:start position:0%
um let let's let's do it like we did
 
04:12:08.590 --> 04:12:08.600 align:start position:0%
legal today where where we start at the
 
04:12:11.469 --> 04:12:11.479 align:start position:0%
at the overview and work our way just
 
04:12:13.389 --> 04:12:13.399 align:start position:0%
straight down all the way through the
 
04:12:17.229 --> 04:12:17.239 align:start position:0%
accounting lines um so that may shift is
 
04:12:20.750 --> 04:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
back further but it would release uh the
 
04:12:23.670 --> 04:12:23.680 align:start position:0%
quality people a little sooner also so
 
04:12:25.710 --> 04:12:25.720 align:start position:0%
what what do you what do you think about
 
04:12:27.710 --> 04:12:27.720 align:start position:0%
that I think that works so you're
 
04:12:30.309 --> 04:12:30.319 align:start position:0%
thinking that let's do quality and
 
04:12:32.830 --> 04:12:32.840 align:start position:0%
Information Services on Monday and and
 
04:12:34.309 --> 04:12:34.319 align:start position:0%
wrap up for
 
04:12:40.469 --> 04:12:40.479 align:start position:0%
today yes okay yeah that will work
 
04:12:44.590 --> 04:12:44.600 align:start position:0%
fine so um so because I I know that uh
 
04:12:48.070 --> 04:12:48.080 align:start position:0%
representative wer had had a 3:30 uh so
 
04:12:51.830 --> 04:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
you're you're out way early very good
 
04:12:53.550 --> 04:12:53.560 align:start position:0%
and I I think that also makes a lot of
 
04:12:54.710 --> 04:12:54.720 align:start position:0%
sense because both of those
 
04:12:58.030 --> 04:12:58.040 align:start position:0%
presentations do um deserve some time
 
04:13:00.070 --> 04:13:00.080 align:start position:0%
they're they're both very weighty and
 
04:13:02.910 --> 04:13:02.920 align:start position:0%
have a lot of information and um I think
 
04:13:04.429 --> 04:13:04.439 align:start position:0%
it would be great to give them the time
 
04:13:06.590 --> 04:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
that they they would really need to give
 
04:13:09.189 --> 04:13:09.199 align:start position:0%
you an understanding so you've seen our
 
04:13:12.469 --> 04:13:12.479 align:start position:0%
Pace now do do do you think uh if
 
04:13:14.710 --> 04:13:14.720 align:start position:0%
starting at 9:30 on Monday that will be
 
04:13:19.750 --> 04:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
done by 3 or so or what do you think yes
 
04:13:21.750 --> 04:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely we might even get to take
 
04:13:23.149 --> 04:13:23.159 align:start position:0%
more than a 20- minute lunch and still
 
04:13:26.349 --> 04:13:26.359 align:start position:0%
be done by three 22 minutes
 
04:13:29.269 --> 04:13:29.279 align:start position:0%
representative wer don't we always have
 
04:13:32.950 --> 04:13:32.960 align:start position:0%
a a Monday morning chair Vice chair
 
04:13:35.070 --> 04:13:35.080 align:start position:0%
meetings I think we may be in the
 
04:13:37.630 --> 04:13:37.640 align:start position:0%
calendar at this point uh but you're
 
04:13:39.469 --> 04:13:39.479 align:start position:0%
you're you're right but I think our
 
04:13:43.269 --> 04:13:43.279 align:start position:0%
kickoff is at 9:30 in the calendar
 
04:13:45.630 --> 04:13:45.640 align:start position:0%
it is just just so you know
 
04:13:47.189 --> 04:13:47.199 align:start position:0%
representative if you did want to open
 
04:13:49.109 --> 04:13:49.119 align:start position:0%
that meeting at 9:30 and then recess
 
04:13:52.349 --> 04:13:52.359 align:start position:0%
until a later time you could do that so
 
04:13:54.590 --> 04:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
I could defer our start till 10: without
 
04:13:56.630 --> 04:13:56.640 align:start position:0%
running into a calendaring
 
04:13:58.910 --> 04:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
problem if you if we were to open up at
 
04:14:00.710 --> 04:14:00.720 align:start position:0%
9:30 and you were to come on and say
 
04:14:04.189 --> 04:14:04.199 align:start position:0%
you're recessing until 10 yes
 
04:14:06.910 --> 04:14:06.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely yes so I I haven't I haven't
 
04:14:09.550 --> 04:14:09.560 align:start position:0%
attended one of those um Monday morning
 
04:14:11.990 --> 04:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
meetings for a while so it might be nice
 
04:14:14.630 --> 04:14:14.640 align:start position:0%
to know what's going on
 
04:14:19.149 --> 04:14:19.159 align:start position:0%
yeah all right so so um let's let's plan
 
04:14:21.750 --> 04:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
is that okay with you miss R you've got
 
04:14:23.710 --> 04:14:23.720 align:start position:0%
that sounds great yeah I think Pace wise
 
04:14:26.590 --> 04:14:26.600 align:start position:0%
we're we're doing fine you had today and
 
04:14:29.469 --> 04:14:29.479 align:start position:0%
um Monday slided slated for office the
 
04:14:31.910 --> 04:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner um I will also let you know
 
04:14:33.910 --> 04:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
I just had a moment to read through my
 
04:14:36.070 --> 04:14:36.080 align:start position:0%
emails and Mary khis in the background
 
04:14:38.790 --> 04:14:38.800 align:start position:0%
as she often does is working on uh
 
04:14:40.710 --> 04:14:40.720 align:start position:0%
putting together a list of all of the
 
04:14:42.030 --> 04:14:42.040 align:start position:0%
positions that moved throughout the
 
04:14:43.590 --> 04:14:43.600 align:start position:0%
department so that will answer your
 
04:14:45.109 --> 04:14:45.119 align:start position:0%
questions for all those smaller moves
 
04:14:47.590 --> 04:14:47.600 align:start position:0%
that did happen um so we'll work on that
 
04:14:49.790 --> 04:14:49.800 align:start position:0%
and get that to you I will work to get
 
04:14:52.149 --> 04:14:52.159 align:start position:0%
you the briefing book um tomorrow and
 
04:14:55.229 --> 04:14:55.239 align:start position:0%
then also the comparison uh the 3,000
 
04:14:56.790 --> 04:14:56.800 align:start position:0%
lines of information that I was talking
 
04:15:01.070 --> 04:15:01.080 align:start position:0%
about for 18 19 and 20 and comparing to
 
04:15:03.389 --> 04:15:03.399 align:start position:0%
2223 um early next
 
04:15:05.870 --> 04:15:05.880 align:start position:0%
week good so you'll you'll have
 
04:15:07.070 --> 04:15:07.080 align:start position:0%
something to
 
04:15:09.590 --> 04:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
do always
 
04:15:14.070 --> 04:15:14.080 align:start position:0%
always so uh all right well um
 
04:15:16.550 --> 04:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
before we hang up does anyone have
 
04:15:18.910 --> 04:15:18.920 align:start position:0%
anything for the good of the
 
04:15:21.990 --> 04:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
effort Jonah you've sat there quietly
 
04:15:24.990 --> 04:15:25.000 align:start position:0%
all day you got to have something no no
 
04:15:26.510 --> 04:15:26.520 align:start position:0%
representative I've been writing down
 
04:15:28.189 --> 04:15:28.199 align:start position:0%
your request so I have been doing I've
 
04:15:30.710 --> 04:15:30.720 align:start position:0%
been doing things don't worry okay I
 
04:15:34.070 --> 04:15:34.080 align:start position:0%
think representative F has as well so I
 
04:15:36.469 --> 04:15:36.479 align:start position:0%
don't I don't know how you're going to
 
04:15:39.630 --> 04:15:39.640 align:start position:0%
coordinate representative Earth are you
 
04:15:42.590 --> 04:15:42.600 align:start position:0%
coordinating with with Mr Ripple or Mr
 
04:15:42.600 --> 04:15:44.990 align:start position:0%
coordinating with with Mr Ripple or Mr
Fel

04:15:44.990 --> 04:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:47.510 --> 04:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
we're coordinating with regard to
 
04:15:49.149 --> 04:15:49.159 align:start position:0%
questions you've been keeping track of
 
04:15:50.710 --> 04:15:50.720 align:start position:0%
questions too I was going to put them
 
04:15:51.830 --> 04:15:51.840 align:start position:0%
together for you and let you deal with
 
04:15:54.349 --> 04:15:54.359 align:start position:0%
them as you see
 
04:15:57.750 --> 04:15:57.760 align:start position:0%
fit I can't hear you copy copy Mr Ripple
 
04:16:00.710 --> 04:16:00.720 align:start position:0%
and Mr felstein if you wouldn't mind
 
04:16:00.720 --> 04:16:01.550 align:start position:0%
and Mr felstein if you wouldn't mind
very

04:16:01.550 --> 04:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
very
 
04:16:03.790 --> 04:16:03.800 align:start position:0%
well right that and Jonah when you send
 
04:16:05.030 --> 04:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
those over if you could send them to
 
04:16:07.830 --> 04:16:07.840 align:start position:0%
Mary kis and I I would be very
 
04:16:10.070 --> 04:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
appreciative I I believe Kevin will
 
04:16:11.189 --> 04:16:11.199 align:start position:0%
probably be the one sending him over
 
04:16:13.269 --> 04:16:13.279 align:start position:0%
right Kevin
 
04:16:15.670 --> 04:16:15.680 align:start position:0%
yeah sure we'll figure that
 
04:16:17.630 --> 04:16:17.640 align:start position:0%
out one
 
04:16:20.870 --> 04:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
one did you have more sir one thing I
 
04:16:24.429 --> 04:16:24.439 align:start position:0%
did pick up in a Governor's briefing
 
04:16:27.229 --> 04:16:27.239 align:start position:0%
they all these uh class 10 have gone up
 
04:16:29.030 --> 04:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
10% which I think is
 
04:16:31.910 --> 04:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
unreasonable but part of and the thing
 
04:16:33.910 --> 04:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
they added to it and you need to confirm
 
04:16:35.910 --> 04:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
this with this department as well is
 
04:16:38.510 --> 04:16:38.520 align:start position:0%
they going up roughly 2% everybody's
 
04:16:41.510 --> 04:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
wages either step increases or contract
 
04:16:45.990 --> 04:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
they're going up five % over medical
 
04:16:48.950 --> 04:16:48.960 align:start position:0%
insurance which we're self-insured I'm I
 
04:16:50.349 --> 04:16:50.359 align:start position:0%
don't understand how that's happened we
 
04:16:53.510 --> 04:16:53.520 align:start position:0%
haven't gone up at all County and 3%
 
04:16:55.429 --> 04:16:55.439 align:start position:0%
because of the incompetence of the New
 
04:16:58.510 --> 04:16:58.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire retirement system they got to
 
04:17:01.429 --> 04:17:01.439 align:start position:0%
we're not falling in line with
 
04:17:06.870 --> 04:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
our 30-year plan and we're about 12 13
 
04:17:11.109 --> 04:17:11.119 align:start position:0%
years into it and uh so the Investments
 
04:17:12.950 --> 04:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
that they're putting things in are are
 
04:17:15.870 --> 04:17:15.880 align:start position:0%
not getting a very good return yet
 
04:17:17.790 --> 04:17:17.800 align:start position:0%
they're still assuming like
 
04:17:20.309 --> 04:17:20.319 align:start position:0%
6.75 which means that they're getting
 
04:17:22.389 --> 04:17:22.399 align:start position:0%
further and further away from what they
 
04:17:24.070 --> 04:17:24.080 align:start position:0%
should be in the funding for that
 
04:17:26.590 --> 04:17:26.600 align:start position:0%
retirement system so these are things
 
04:17:28.429 --> 04:17:28.439 align:start position:0%
that are endemic across the whole system
 
04:17:31.830 --> 04:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
that needs to be addressed at a higher
 
04:17:35.950 --> 04:17:35.960 align:start position:0%
level with the uh Governor's U budget
 
04:17:37.309 --> 04:17:37.319 align:start position:0%
guy and I don't think I think they
 
04:17:38.349 --> 04:17:38.359 align:start position:0%
should be able to do something about
 
04:17:40.389 --> 04:17:40.399 align:start position:0%
that 5% increase in the health insurance
 
04:17:42.870 --> 04:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
either reduce what they're delivering or
 
04:17:45.630 --> 04:17:45.640 align:start position:0%
go to a different coordinator I think
 
04:17:47.070 --> 04:17:47.080 align:start position:0%
even though we're self-insured I think
 
04:17:51.389 --> 04:17:51.399 align:start position:0%
they hire a third party toh manage that
 
04:17:53.750 --> 04:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
obviously there's not a very good job if
 
04:17:56.830 --> 04:17:56.840 align:start position:0%
it's gone up that much so some things we
 
04:17:59.229 --> 04:17:59.239 align:start position:0%
got to deal with that are outside of the
 
04:18:01.870 --> 04:18:01.880 align:start position:0%
control of this Division and and this
 
04:18:03.990 --> 04:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
agency if if they're not going to
 
04:18:06.269 --> 04:18:06.279 align:start position:0%
control those things at the higher level
 
04:18:06.279 --> 04:18:07.830 align:start position:0%
control those things at the higher level
so

04:18:07.830 --> 04:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:18:09.790 --> 04:18:09.800 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we don't have that much we
 
04:18:13.429 --> 04:18:13.439 align:start position:0%
don't have a 10% increase in Revenue so
 
04:18:17.309 --> 04:18:17.319 align:start position:0%
we're still stuck with searching for
 
04:18:20.870 --> 04:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
savings do do you have an update on when
 
04:18:24.670 --> 04:18:24.680 align:start position:0%
Ways and Means might send us um their
 
04:18:24.680 --> 04:18:25.550 align:start position:0%
Ways and Means might send us um their
first

04:18:25.550 --> 04:18:25.560 align:start position:0%
first
 
04:18:29.109 --> 04:18:29.119 align:start position:0%
guess not till the 23rd is is last I
 
04:18:32.590 --> 04:18:32.600 align:start position:0%
heard February 23rd or March 23rd I'm
 
04:18:37.830 --> 04:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
sorry February 23rd okay all right and
 
04:18:39.790 --> 04:18:39.800 align:start position:0%
and then and then is it the practice of
 
04:18:41.830 --> 04:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
the finance committee to split that out
 
04:18:43.389 --> 04:18:43.399 align:start position:0%
to give the division
 
04:18:43.399 --> 04:18:45.109 align:start position:0%
to give the division
targets

04:18:45.109 --> 04:18:45.119 align:start position:0%
targets
 
04:18:49.030 --> 04:18:49.040 align:start position:0%
yes okay very good like to see how much
 
04:18:51.429 --> 04:18:51.439 align:start position:0%
we can we can come in how close we can
 
04:18:53.990 --> 04:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
come but you know it's it's going to be
 
04:18:56.429 --> 04:18:56.439 align:start position:0%
tough uh I've got a
 
04:19:00.189 --> 04:19:00.199 align:start position:0%
plan over in division two you know
 
04:19:02.070 --> 04:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
they're talking about a $50
 
04:19:05.750 --> 04:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
million uh education trust fund
 
04:19:08.590 --> 04:19:08.600 align:start position:0%
Surplus we don't need to have a surplus
 
04:19:11.109 --> 04:19:11.119 align:start position:0%
in a fund that we need to use everywhere
 
04:19:13.070 --> 04:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
else and since education Trust TR fund
 
04:19:14.990 --> 04:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
comes out of the the general fund
 
04:19:16.830 --> 04:19:16.840 align:start position:0%
sources we need to change the
 
04:19:19.469 --> 04:19:19.479 align:start position:0%
percentages from the sources so that 50
 
04:19:22.389 --> 04:19:22.399 align:start position:0%
million doesn't go to a surplus we need
 
04:19:27.389 --> 04:19:27.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:32.229 --> 04:19:32.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:34.550 --> 04:19:34.560 align:start position:0%
