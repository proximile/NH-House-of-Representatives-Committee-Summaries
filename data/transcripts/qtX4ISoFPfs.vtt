00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 align:start position:0%
senate bill 228 which was a bill that
 
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 align:start position:0%
passed on a voice vote in the senate and
 
00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:15.830 align:start position:0%
passed on a voice vote in the senate and
had

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 align:start position:0%
had
 
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 align:start position:0%
near unanimous support at the public
 
00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.310 align:start position:0%
near unanimous support at the public
hearing

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 align:start position:0%
i was asked to introduce this bill by
 
00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 align:start position:0%
the society of
 
00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:25.830 align:start position:0%
the society of
um

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 align:start position:0%
physician assistance i think it's going
 
00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
to increase access to health care
 
00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 align:start position:0%
especially in
 
00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 align:start position:0%
areas of the state that i represent more
 
00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 align:start position:0%
rural areas
 
00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 align:start position:0%
it will help contain costs
 
00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 align:start position:0%
and it will make sure that new hampshire
 
00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 align:start position:0%
is an attractive state for physician
 
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.350 align:start position:0%
is an attractive state for physician
assistance

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 align:start position:0%
assistance
 
00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 align:start position:0%
to practice
 
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.310 align:start position:0%
to practice
especially

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 align:start position:0%
especially
 
00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:50.079 align:start position:0%
given that maine and vermont have
 
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 align:start position:0%
enacted similar legislation
 
00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
we use vermont's legislation almost as a
 
00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 align:start position:0%
model for this
 
00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.910 align:start position:0%
model for this
but

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 align:start position:0%
when i was asked to introduce this bill
 
00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 align:start position:0%
i made it very clear to the head of the
 
00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 align:start position:0%
physician's assistance that they had to
 
00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 align:start position:0%
work with the medical society and the
 
00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 align:start position:0%
hospital association
 
00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 align:start position:0%
as well as oplc to come to terms on an
 
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.949 align:start position:0%
as well as oplc to come to terms on an
agreed-upon

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 align:start position:0%
agreed-upon
 
00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:20.309 align:start position:0%
agreed-upon
bill

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 align:start position:0%
dave cussey is going to be here um he is
 
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 align:start position:0%
here representing the
 
00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
physician's assistants and interestingly
 
00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
he told me that
 
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
there's not a single
 
00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
physician assistant able to testify
 
00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 align:start position:0%
today because they all are overwhelmed
 
00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 align:start position:0%
at work so
 
00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 align:start position:0%
if ever there was um
 
00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
an indication that this bill is
 
00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 align:start position:0%
necessary i think that's it
 
00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 align:start position:0%
a couple of things on the bill i think
 
00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 align:start position:0%
that are important to note that it does
 
00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 align:start position:0%
not remove what's known as the legal
 
00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 align:start position:0%
tether or the relationship between a
 
00:03:00.149 --> 00:03:00.159 align:start position:0%
physician and a physician's assistant
 
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 align:start position:0%
and it does not allow a physician
 
00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
assistant to practice independently
 
00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 align:start position:0%
that obviously was very important to
 
00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 align:start position:0%
the medical society and the hospital
 
00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.550 align:start position:0%
the medical society and the hospital
association

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 align:start position:0%
association
 
00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 align:start position:0%
it does not absolve a physician from
 
00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 align:start position:0%
liability if they have involvement in
 
00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
the care of a patient the bill makes
 
00:03:24.149 --> 00:03:24.159 align:start position:0%
this clear
 
00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 align:start position:0%
what it will do is align current
 
00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 align:start position:0%
physician assistant regulations to
 
00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 align:start position:0%
better reflect how they actually
 
00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:32.710 align:start position:0%
better reflect how they actually
practice

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 align:start position:0%
practice
 
00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 align:start position:0%
medicine in today's modern health care
 
00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:36.470 align:start position:0%
medicine in today's modern health care
world

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
world
 
00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 align:start position:0%
so the bill has five
 
00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 align:start position:0%
components number one
 
00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 align:start position:0%
it takes the existing legal requirement
 
00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 align:start position:0%
that a physician and a physician
 
00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
assistant sign what's known as a
 
00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:50.319 align:start position:0%
supervisory agreement
 
00:03:52.149 --> 00:03:52.159 align:start position:0%
that has to be on file with the board of
 
00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:53.350 align:start position:0%
that has to be on file with the board of
medicine

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 align:start position:0%
medicine
 
00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 align:start position:0%
and it combines it with
 
00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 align:start position:0%
the requirement that a health care
 
00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 align:start position:0%
employer has a practice agreement in
 
00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:01.910 align:start position:0%
employer has a practice agreement in
place

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
place
 
00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
two that practice agreement outlines how
 
00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 align:start position:0%
the physician assistant interacts and
 
00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:10.159 align:start position:0%
collaborates with physicians
 
00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 align:start position:0%
and any other member of that health care
 
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.429 align:start position:0%
and any other member of that health care
team

00:04:13.429 --> 00:04:13.439 align:start position:0%
team
 
00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 align:start position:0%
the bill calls this
 
00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 align:start position:0%
a collaboration agreement
 
00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 align:start position:0%
then the bill will make clear that
 
00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 align:start position:0%
physician assistants are liable for the
 
00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 align:start position:0%
care they provide
 
00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639 align:start position:0%
that physicians aren't liable
 
00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 align:start position:0%
for care provided solely by a physician
 
00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:32.479 align:start position:0%
assistant simply because they've signed
 
00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 align:start position:0%
a collaboration agreement but again
 
00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 align:start position:0%
the amendment that the senate adopted
 
00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 align:start position:0%
makes it clear that this bill does not
 
00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 align:start position:0%
indemnify physicians if a physician as
 
00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 align:start position:0%
part of the care of that patient
 
00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 align:start position:0%
the third thing is the bill allows a
 
00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
physician assistant to directly bill the
 
00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 align:start position:0%
public and private insurers for care
 
00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
they provide
 
00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 align:start position:0%
and receive direct payment from those
 
00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.990 align:start position:0%
and receive direct payment from those
insurers

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
insurers
 
00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 align:start position:0%
the bill makes it clear this would only
 
00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 align:start position:0%
be allowed
 
00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
when permitted by federal law and only
 
00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:06.639 align:start position:0%
when appropriate based on the physician
 
00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
assistance employer setting
 
00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
fourth the bill stipulates that the
 
00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
physician assistant does not need a
 
00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 align:start position:0%
collaboration agreement to provide care
 
00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 align:start position:0%
during an emergency or a disaster
 
00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 align:start position:0%
which we've seen come into play
 
00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
with covid but also other situations
 
00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
in the recent past
 
00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:29.199 align:start position:0%
and fifth
 
00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.120 align:start position:0%
the bill makes it clear
 
00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 align:start position:0%
physician assistants do not need a
 
00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:35.919 align:start position:0%
collaboration agreement to volunteer
 
00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:38.160 align:start position:0%
to provide basic medical care at summer
 
00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:40.880 align:start position:0%
camps charity road races and similar
 
00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:44.800 align:start position:0%
activities and lastly i just want to
 
00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:47.919 align:start position:0%
touch base very quickly on the
 
00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:51.440 align:start position:0%
one person that testified in opposition
 
00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.080 align:start position:0%
to the bill an attorney representing the
 
00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
association for adjustment
 
00:05:59.350 --> 00:05:59.360 align:start position:0%

justice excuse me
that

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:00.639 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
requested that liability coverage be
 
00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:05.120 align:start position:0%
required in the bill and if you look on
 
00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
page six
 
00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:08.070 align:start position:0%
page six
starting

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:08.080 align:start position:0%
starting
 
00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:11.440 align:start position:0%
at line 22 it says that physicians
 
00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.270 align:start position:0%
at line 22 it says that physicians
assistants

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:13.280 align:start position:0%

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:16.080 align:start position:0%

00:06:18.309 --> 00:06:18.319 align:start position:0%

00:06:55.029 --> 00:06:55.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:58.710 --> 00:06:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
i'll just read it i think it's pretty
 
00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.230 align:start position:0%
i'll just read it i think it's pretty
clear

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:02.240 align:start position:0%
clear
 
00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:04.880 align:start position:0%
physician assistants actively engaged in
 
00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:06.800 align:start position:0%
providing medical care
 
00:07:09.189 --> 00:07:09.199 align:start position:0%
shall have adequate current and valid
 
00:07:09.199 --> 00:07:10.390 align:start position:0%
shall have adequate current and valid
professional

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:10.400 align:start position:0%
professional
 
00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:12.160 align:start position:0%
liability insurance coverage so it
 
00:07:15.189 --> 00:07:15.199 align:start position:0%
requires them to have coverage
 
00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm talking about when is the
 
00:07:21.029 --> 00:07:21.039 align:start position:0%
physician absolved from liability and
 
00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:23.840 align:start position:0%
page five okay oh that's all right all
 
00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:31.430 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:33.749 --> 00:07:33.759 align:start position:0%
other questions representative pearson
 
00:07:35.189 --> 00:07:35.199 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you senator
 
00:07:35.199 --> 00:07:36.469 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you senator
bradley

00:07:36.469 --> 00:07:36.479 align:start position:0%
bradley
 
00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:38.240 align:start position:0%
the professional liability insurance
 
00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:40.160 align:start position:0%
coverage that you're referring to
 
00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:42.400 align:start position:0%
would that in layman's terms be just
 
00:07:44.309 --> 00:07:44.319 align:start position:0%
simply malpractice or is that a
 
00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:46.400 align:start position:0%
different type of
 
00:07:49.029 --> 00:07:49.039 align:start position:0%
insurance coverage i think it's meant to
 
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
include medical malpractice and that
 
00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
kind of coverage yes great thank you
 
00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:56.400 align:start position:0%

now the demand on health care now that
 
00:08:39.829 --> 00:08:39.839 align:start position:0%
the pandemic is easing hopefully
 
00:08:39.839 --> 00:08:41.110 align:start position:0%
the pandemic is easing hopefully
permanently

permanently
 
00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:43.120 align:start position:0%

as you might expect we we do support sb
 
00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
228 as passed by the senate and i just
 
00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:24.160 align:start position:0%
thought i'd take a second just for those
 
00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:26.320 align:start position:0%
who may not be as familiar on this
 
00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:28.640 align:start position:0%
committee with pas there's you know some
 
00:09:30.389 --> 00:09:30.399 align:start position:0%
misconceptions that have been kind of
 
00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
baked in if you will over the many
 
00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
decades since the profession
 
00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:36.240 align:start position:0%
was introduced to the health care field
 
00:09:38.389 --> 00:09:38.399 align:start position:0%
many decades ago
 
00:09:38.399 --> 00:09:39.350 align:start position:0%
many decades ago
but

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:39.360 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:40.550 align:start position:0%
but
pas

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
pas
 
00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
despite the name pas are not assistance
 
00:09:47.509 --> 00:09:47.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:49.360 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire they are licensed
 
00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:51.200 align:start position:0%
medical providers and this is the case
 
00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:53.680 align:start position:0%
nationwide who diagnose illness develop
 
00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
and manage treatment plans prescribe
 
00:09:57.990 --> 00:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
medication and often serve as a
 
00:09:59.269 --> 00:09:59.279 align:start position:0%
patient's uh
 
00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:01.360 align:start position:0%
principal health care professional
 
00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:04.240 align:start position:0%
uh they receive uh af
 
00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:06.720 align:start position:0%
they they do receive a masters and they
 
00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:08.640 align:start position:0%
receive thousands of hours of training
 
00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
before they are um
 
00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
uh before they are
 
00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
considered physician assistants and able
 
00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:16.720 align:start position:0%
to practice medicine
 
00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:18.720 align:start position:0%
and uh that this is the case in every
 
00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:20.720 align:start position:0%
state uh they provide care in every
 
00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:23.120 align:start position:0%
medical setting and every specialty and
 
00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
they do improve access to health care uh
 
00:10:27.509 --> 00:10:27.519 align:start position:0%
across the state and across the country
 
00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
especially in rural areas
 
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.030 align:start position:0%
especially in rural areas
uh

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned uh they work in hospitals
 
00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:35.600 align:start position:0%
medical offices urgent cares community
 
00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
health centers nursing homes and and
 
00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:39.680 align:start position:0%
other uh in workplace clinics throughout
 
00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:10:42.949 --> 00:10:42.959 align:start position:0%
and they also of course work in federal
 
00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:44.800 align:start position:0%
government agencies and at the va
 
00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
medical centers including
 
00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:48.240 align:start position:0%
in manchester
 
00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
so senator bradley
 
00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
did a great job introducing the bill
 
00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:55.200 align:start position:0%
i'll just touch on a few more details
 
00:10:57.910 --> 00:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
and representative scitec maybe i'll
 
00:10:59.190 --> 00:10:59.200 align:start position:0%
give a little more detail on the
 
00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
liability provision as well if
 
00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
if i may
 
00:11:04.949 --> 00:11:04.959 align:start position:0%
so i think
 
00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:07.760 align:start position:0%
it is important to note what this bill
 
00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:10.160 align:start position:0%
does not do first of all i know it's a
 
00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
six or so page bill but this bill is not
 
00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
in any way a major overhaul of pa
 
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
practice regulation this is
 
00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
the there is no change in the regulatory
 
00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:22.240 align:start position:0%
regimen for pas at all
 
00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:24.720 align:start position:0%
uh there are no
 
00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
real major reforms of any kind
 
00:11:29.829 --> 00:11:29.839 align:start position:0%
that this bill proposes for pas there's
 
00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
no expansion or change of the scope of
 
00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
practice for pas uh i would respectfully
 
00:11:36.389 --> 00:11:36.399 align:start position:0%
suggest to the committee that this
 
00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
really provides as senator bradley
 
00:11:41.269 --> 00:11:41.279 align:start position:0%
outlined five common sense changes to
 
00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:44.240 align:start position:0%
represent uh how pas now practice in a
 
00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:46.640 align:start position:0%
modern health care setting uh that you
 
00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
know really need to be updated since uh
 
00:11:52.389 --> 00:11:52.399 align:start position:0%
the pa statute was uh was created and
 
00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
amended over the last many decades
 
00:11:58.069 --> 00:11:58.079 align:start position:0%
as senator bradley mentioned this does
 
00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:00.240 align:start position:0%
not provide a path to independent
 
00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
practice for pas
 
00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:04.480 align:start position:0%
period i know there's been one or two
 
00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:06.800 align:start position:0%
folks who maybe have suggested that but
 
00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:08.160 align:start position:0%
that is
 
00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:10.240 align:start position:0%
not accurate and that is something that
 
00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:11.110 align:start position:0%
not accurate and that is something that
uh

00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:13.360 align:start position:0%
was important to the medical society
 
00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:16.480 align:start position:0%
mr padmore is here uh can can uh can
 
00:12:18.069 --> 00:12:18.079 align:start position:0%
validate that
 
00:12:18.079 --> 00:12:19.509 align:start position:0%
validate that
um

00:12:19.509 --> 00:12:19.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
21 states over the last five years have
 
00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
introduced pa practice or passed and
 
00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:26.320 align:start position:0%
adopted pa practice modernization
 
00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:28.720 align:start position:0%
legislation most notably vermont and
 
00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:29.829 align:start position:0%
legislation most notably vermont and
maine

00:12:29.829 --> 00:12:29.839 align:start position:0%
maine
 
00:12:32.069 --> 00:12:32.079 align:start position:0%
massachusetts has a bill pending
 
00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
and new york state also has passed a
 
00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:36.800 align:start position:0%
bill and so has rhode island
 
00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:38.720 align:start position:0%
and and as senator bradley mentioned a
 
00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:40.720 align:start position:0%
good portion of this bill before you was
 
00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:42.320 align:start position:0%
taken from vermont
 
00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:44.790 align:start position:0%
taken from vermont
um

00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:46.720 align:start position:0%
and again the goal here is to make sure
 
00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:49.600 align:start position:0%
that we are attracting and retaining pas
 
00:12:52.069 --> 00:12:52.079 align:start position:0%
that our regulations are in line with
 
00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:55.120 align:start position:0%
other states and and are um are updated
 
00:12:57.750 --> 00:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
so that there are no barriers to pa uh
 
00:12:59.590 --> 00:12:59.600 align:start position:0%

so

so
 
00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
senator bradley mentioned how this bill
 
00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
would create a collaboration agreement
 
00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:43.120 align:start position:0%
all that is very simply is you have the
 
00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
responsible supervisory
 
00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:47.030 align:start position:0%
responsible supervisory
physician

00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
physician
 
00:13:49.509 --> 00:13:49.519 align:start position:0%
form right now in current law that must
 
00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
be sent to the board of medicine and
 
00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
kept on file there also per regs you
 
00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
have a practice agreement that must be
 
00:14:00.389 --> 00:14:00.399 align:start position:0%
kept on file at a pa's employer that
 
00:14:03.509 --> 00:14:03.519 align:start position:0%
really just says outlines how a pa
 
00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:04.720 align:start position:0%
interacts with members of the health
 
00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:07.360 align:start position:0%
care team if it's a physician if it's a
 
00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
respiratory therapist other folks
 
00:14:12.389 --> 00:14:12.399 align:start position:0%
and all the bill is doing is it's taking
 
00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:14.160 align:start position:0%
that rsp
 
00:14:16.389 --> 00:14:16.399 align:start position:0%
and that practice agreement
 
00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:19.120 align:start position:0%
combining them together in one document
 
00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:21.440 align:start position:0%
and calling it a collaboration agreement
 
00:14:23.509 --> 00:14:23.519 align:start position:0%
so there's still that need to name a
 
00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
physician and a pa with a signature from
 
00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:27.269 align:start position:0%
physician and a pa with a signature from
both

00:14:27.269 --> 00:14:27.279 align:start position:0%
both
 
00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
and there's still a need for a practice
 
00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
agreement we're just combining it and
 
00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:32.560 align:start position:0%
that agreement will be maintained on
 
00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
file at the place of employment
 
00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
as the practice agreement is now so none
 
00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:39.440 align:start position:0%
of that changes there's still that legal
 
00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:40.629 align:start position:0%
of that changes there's still that legal
tether

00:14:40.629 --> 00:14:40.639 align:start position:0%
tether
 
00:14:43.189 --> 00:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
and there's still a uh illegal and that
 
00:14:45.509 --> 00:14:45.519 align:start position:0%
will be in statute now a requirement
 
00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:47.680 align:start position:0%
that a collaboration agreement is kept
 
00:14:49.829 --> 00:14:49.839 align:start position:0%
on file uh those can be the
 
00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
collaboration agreement could say
 
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
whatever the employer and the pa wants
 
00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:54.560 align:start position:0%
but what the bill does is it says
 
00:14:57.590 --> 00:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
it must identify at least
 
00:14:59.430 --> 00:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
who the collaborators are
 
00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
how the pa communicates with members of
 
00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
the the health care team and when based
 
00:15:05.509 --> 00:15:05.519 align:start position:0%
on their education training
 
00:15:07.829 --> 00:15:07.839 align:start position:0%
and experience so
 
00:15:10.949 --> 00:15:10.959 align:start position:0%
again not a not a big reform just i
 
00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:12.240 align:start position:0%
would respectfully suggest a
 
00:15:14.389 --> 00:15:14.399 align:start position:0%
streamlining of of the regulatory
 
00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
process there
 
00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
in terms of and in this representative
 
00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
scitec this may help
 
00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
address your question
 
00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
in terms of the liability requirement so
 
00:15:28.949 --> 00:15:28.959 align:start position:0%
right now pas can be sued for the care
 
00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:30.240 align:start position:0%
they provide
 
00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:31.590 align:start position:0%
they provide
but

00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:15:33.189 --> 00:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:15:36.069 --> 00:15:36.079 align:start position:0%
the physician who signs what is that rsp
 
00:15:36.079 --> 00:15:36.949 align:start position:0%
the physician who signs what is that rsp
form

00:15:36.949 --> 00:15:36.959 align:start position:0%
form
 
00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
they can be sued right now just for the
 
00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
simple fact that they had their name on
 
00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
that form they may not have been
 
00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
they may not have had anything to do
 
00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
with that patient interaction uh they
 
00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
may have been seeing their own patients
 
00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:51.680 align:start position:0%
who that whole time um but they they are
 
00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
they can be sued simply because they're
 
00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:56.160 align:start position:0%
on that piece of paper all the bill does
 
00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:57.440 align:start position:0%
it says
 
00:15:59.829 --> 00:15:59.839 align:start position:0%
that that no longer can be the case you
 
00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
can't you no longer could sue that that
 
00:16:04.069 --> 00:16:04.079 align:start position:0%
physician simply because they have
 
00:16:05.749 --> 00:16:05.759 align:start position:0%
signed what would this bill would call
 
00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
the collaboration agreement but it makes
 
00:16:09.749 --> 00:16:09.759 align:start position:0%
very clear that that physician if they
 
00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:12.240 align:start position:0%
are involved in any way shape or form
 
00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
they are still liable
 
00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:16.160 align:start position:0%
uh they can be sued if they were
 
00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
involved in that patient interaction in
 
00:16:20.069 --> 00:16:20.079 align:start position:0%
any way shape or form
 
00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
even if it's just the pa picking up the
 
00:16:24.949 --> 00:16:24.959 align:start position:0%
phone and and asking a question now the
 
00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:26.720 align:start position:0%
liability of course would kick in that's
 
00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
how it is now uh
 
00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:31.120 align:start position:0%
of course but the the statute makes that
 
00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
clear so we think that's an improvement
 
00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
um the the liability issue is a has
 
00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
always been a barrier to employment for
 
00:16:40.069 --> 00:16:40.079 align:start position:0%
pas because
 
00:16:42.629 --> 00:16:42.639 align:start position:0%
no other health care provider has that
 
00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
requirement put upon them of course that
 
00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:46.069 align:start position:0%
requirement put upon them of course that
they're

00:16:46.069 --> 00:16:46.079 align:start position:0%
they're
 
00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
that they have a legal tether to a
 
00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:50.320 align:start position:0%
physician and so a lot of times
 
00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:52.160 align:start position:0%
healthcare employers
 
00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:54.160 align:start position:0%
or physicians employed by healthcare
 
00:16:55.749 --> 00:16:55.759 align:start position:0%
employers they don't like to be on the
 
00:16:58.629 --> 00:16:58.639 align:start position:0%
hook to be sued by signing these rsps so
 
00:17:00.389 --> 00:17:00.399 align:start position:0%
by removing that
 
00:17:02.629 --> 00:17:02.639 align:start position:0%
that makes pas perhaps a little bit more
 
00:17:02.639 --> 00:17:03.749 align:start position:0%
that makes pas perhaps a little bit more
attractive

00:17:03.749 --> 00:17:03.759 align:start position:0%
attractive
 
00:17:05.669 --> 00:17:05.679 align:start position:0%
when compared to other health care
 
00:17:07.590 --> 00:17:07.600 align:start position:0%
employers when when they're
 
00:17:09.669 --> 00:17:09.679 align:start position:0%
looking to
 
00:17:12.069 --> 00:17:12.079 align:start position:0%
change jobs
 
00:17:14.949 --> 00:17:14.959 align:start position:0%
the issue of direct billing again pas
 
00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:16.640 align:start position:0%
are only they're the only health care
 
00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
providers that cannot right now
 
00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:20.640 align:start position:0%
bill directly or being reimbursed
 
00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
directly from health insurers be it
 
00:17:25.429 --> 00:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
public or private insurers
 
00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:17:28.549 --> 00:17:28.559 align:start position:0%
general this is really kind of a niche
 
00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:30.320 align:start position:0%
issue but it really impacts those who
 
00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
provide care in more rural settings
 
00:17:34.789 --> 00:17:34.799 align:start position:0%
this allows them to be able a lot of
 
00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
these more rural health care providers
 
00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
maybe don't have the administrative or
 
00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:41.200 align:start position:0%
don't want to bear the administrative
 
00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
costs so for the pas to be able to build
 
00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:46.160 align:start position:0%
directly and take on that administrative
 
00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
burden on their own is really what this
 
00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
is all about in rural health care
 
00:17:51.029 --> 00:17:51.039 align:start position:0%
settings in
 
00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:53.360 align:start position:0%
big employment health care settings uh
 
00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
you know if it's dr hitchcock others
 
00:17:59.190 --> 00:17:59.200 align:start position:0%
this does not apply and does not require
 
00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
any health care provider to have a pa
 
00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:04.240 align:start position:0%
bill directly or be reimbursed it allows
 
00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
that flexibility based on employment
 
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.750 align:start position:0%
that flexibility based on employment
setting

00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
setting
 
00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:09.440 align:start position:0%
senator bradley mentioned that this bill
 
00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
makes clear that a pa would not need
 
00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:12.710 align:start position:0%
makes clear that a pa would not need
a

00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:12.720 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
collaboration agreement
 
00:18:17.029 --> 00:18:17.039 align:start position:0%
for providing emergency care uh i think
 
00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
the good this is the good samaritan
 
00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
situation uh car accident on the side of
 
00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:22.960 align:start position:0%
the road of course they may not be able
 
00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
to be physically uh or you know of
 
00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:27.440 align:start position:0%
course it wouldn't be they're
 
00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
collaborating physician would not be
 
00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:30.640 align:start position:0%
present and they may not be able to
 
00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:32.480 align:start position:0%
reach them electronically when they're
 
00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:34.160 align:start position:0%
when they're rendering care that really
 
00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
gets to this to that issue um
 
00:18:39.909 --> 00:18:39.919 align:start position:0%
and then uh with the volunteer care at
 
00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
charity races or things like that this
 
00:18:44.789 --> 00:18:44.799 align:start position:0%
is just allowing pas to provide
 
00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:46.400 align:start position:0%
you know basic
 
00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:48.320 align:start position:0%
uh general care of course if someone had
 
00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
a more serious injury there'd be um you
 
00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
know there'd be a transportation to a a
 
00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:55.360 align:start position:0%
hospital or something on those lines
 
00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
they can volunteer at their child summer
 
00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:58.070 align:start position:0%
they can volunteer at their child summer
camp

00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
camp
 
00:18:59.669 --> 00:18:59.679 align:start position:0%
that type of thing and and they don't
 
00:19:01.669 --> 00:19:01.679 align:start position:0%
need a collaboration agreement for that
 
00:19:01.679 --> 00:19:02.390 align:start position:0%
need a collaboration agreement for that
so

00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
i again i would respectfully suggest
 
00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:06.160 align:start position:0%
that these are five
 
00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
common sense
 
00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:08.549 align:start position:0%
common sense
changes

00:19:08.549 --> 00:19:08.559 align:start position:0%
changes
 
00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:10.400 align:start position:0%
to existing law again
 
00:19:14.789 --> 00:19:14.799 align:start position:0%
uh no big overhauls here um and uh and
 
00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:16.480 align:start position:0%
and again we appreciate the fact that
 
00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:18.640 align:start position:0%
all all stakeholders were able to come
 
00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
together to agree on a bill and and i
 
00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
look forward to uh answering any
 
00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee thank you
 
00:19:25.909 --> 00:19:25.919 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:27.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative fellowes has a
 
00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:30.160 align:start position:0%
question and then like us
 
00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:33.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um
 
00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
do physicians
 
00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
do physicians assistants
 
00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:39.350 align:start position:0%
do physicians assistants
have

00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:42.240 align:start position:0%
specialty training before they enter
 
00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:45.200 align:start position:0%
into these agreements because
 
00:19:47.669 --> 00:19:47.679 align:start position:0%
you know the ones that i've encountered
 
00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
have all been
 
00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:52.480 align:start position:0%
um under a specialty doctor like an ent
 
00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:53.350 align:start position:0%
um under a specialty doctor like an ent
or

00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:53.360 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:19:55.669 --> 00:19:55.679 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
00:19:57.510 --> 00:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
so do they have that training before
 
00:19:58.950 --> 00:19:58.960 align:start position:0%
they start
 
00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:01.120 align:start position:0%
or do they enter these agreements with
 
00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
just a general
 
00:20:04.789 --> 00:20:04.799 align:start position:0%
background in
 
00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
medicine so when they uh
 
00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
and this could apply to a
 
00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
pa right out of
 
00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:14.240 align:start position:0%
school or this could provide to apply to
 
00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:18.320 align:start position:0%
a pa who's 20 years into their career
 
00:20:19.909 --> 00:20:19.919 align:start position:0%
so the answer is they they must sign
 
00:20:21.669 --> 00:20:21.679 align:start position:0%
that practice agreement and they must
 
00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:22.880 align:start position:0%
have that
 
00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:24.230 align:start position:0%
have that
um

00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:25.430 align:start position:0%
um
signature

00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
signature
 
00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
agreement with the doctor right now it's
 
00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:28.640 align:start position:0%
the rrsp we'd look to call it a
 
00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:30.640 align:start position:0%
collaboration agreement when they start
 
00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:33.200 align:start position:0%
their employment the practice agreement
 
00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:35.200 align:start position:0%
makes clear though
 
00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
that they can't do anything within that
 
00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:39.430 align:start position:0%
that they can't do anything within that
specialty

00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:39.440 align:start position:0%
specialty
 
00:20:42.789 --> 00:20:42.799 align:start position:0%
that is outside of their education
 
00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:44.960 align:start position:0%
training and experience
 
00:20:45.909 --> 00:20:45.919 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:20:48.149 --> 00:20:48.159 align:start position:0%
if someone is changing specialties for
 
00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:51.200 align:start position:0%
example i think would be pr or or either
 
00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:52.720 align:start position:0%
new to a specialty regardless of
 
00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
scenario they're right out of school or
 
00:20:57.750 --> 00:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
they're coming from maybe uh you know an
 
00:21:01.029 --> 00:21:01.039 align:start position:0%
ent and going over to urology
 
00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:04.240 align:start position:0%
they the in in the law now would say
 
00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
that they cannot
 
00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:06.710 align:start position:0%
that they cannot
be

00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:06.720 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:08.240 align:start position:0%
doing anything they could not be doing
 
00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:10.240 align:start position:0%
anything in terms of providing care that
 
00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:12.400 align:start position:0%
would be outside of their
 
00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:13.430 align:start position:0%
would be outside of their
training

00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
training
 
00:21:17.029 --> 00:21:17.039 align:start position:0%
uh education and experience so there may
 
00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:19.280 align:start position:0%
be additional training uh that they
 
00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
would that they would need to undergo
 
00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:23.360 align:start position:0%
perhaps even before they start in that
 
00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
specialty but there certainly would be
 
00:21:29.029 --> 00:21:29.039 align:start position:0%
experience that the physicians
 
00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
would would require before they're
 
00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
allowed to be um
 
00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:35.200 align:start position:0%
off doing anything on their own if
 
00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
you're talking about perhaps a surgical
 
00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:38.320 align:start position:0%
setting or something like that you know
 
00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:40.640 align:start position:0%
a pa is not performing surgery or
 
00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
so let's just take the the ent for
 
00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:48.870 align:start position:0%
so let's just take the the ent for
example

00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
example
 
00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:49.990 align:start position:0%
example
so

00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
this physician
 
00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
assistant graduates from the physician
 
00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
assistant program and this is going to
 
00:21:59.029 --> 00:21:59.039 align:start position:0%
be his first job
 
00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
and he's um
 
00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:01.430 align:start position:0%
and he's um
is

00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:04.240 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason is going to work
 
00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:05.200 align:start position:0%
with a
 
00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:06.310 align:start position:0%
with a
ent

00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:06.320 align:start position:0%
ent
 
00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:08.070 align:start position:0%
ent
physician

00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
physician
 
00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:11.190 align:start position:0%
physician
so

00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
so i understand that this this can work
 
00:22:15.669 --> 00:22:15.679 align:start position:0%
if he has a lot of supervision to begin
 
00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:18.320 align:start position:0%
with and learns how to do you know the
 
00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:20.240 align:start position:0%
certain procedures which are you know
 
00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:21.590 align:start position:0%
certain procedures which are you know
not

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
too dangerous and
 
00:22:25.669 --> 00:22:25.679 align:start position:0%
somebody's watching over what he's doing
 
00:22:25.679 --> 00:22:27.990 align:start position:0%
somebody's watching over what he's doing
but

00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
create a situation where
 
00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
i'm don't have the confidence that he's
 
00:22:38.789 --> 00:22:38.799 align:start position:0%
going to
 
00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:42.320 align:start position:0%
get the supervision in the early years
 
00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:43.669 align:start position:0%
get the supervision in the early years
representative

00:22:43.669 --> 00:22:43.679 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:46.480 align:start position:0%
physicians assistants do get specialty
 
00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
training of various sorts as part of
 
00:22:50.549 --> 00:22:50.559 align:start position:0%
their they do rotations the same way
 
00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
doctors do
 
00:22:54.950 --> 00:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
so they might have we would hope that
 
00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
somebody's right out of school would
 
00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
have completed a rotation in the
 
00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
specialty they're going to work in
 
00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:04.720 align:start position:0%
okay that that is that's is training is
 
00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:06.070 align:start position:0%
okay that that is that's is training is
available

00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
available
 
00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:10.240 align:start position:0%
and may i madam chair uh so
 
00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
the chair is is correct so they have
 
00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
thousands of hours of clinical training
 
00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
before they even uh are allowed to to
 
00:23:19.669 --> 00:23:19.679 align:start position:0%
practice um
 
00:23:22.549 --> 00:23:22.559 align:start position:0%
the same as nurse practitioners
 
00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:24.880 align:start position:0%
who do not have any supervisory
 
00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
requirement they can come right out of
 
00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:27.440 align:start position:0%
school and frankly they can open their
 
00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
own practice
 
00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:29.990 align:start position:0%
own practice
so

00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
with the with the pas
 
00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:35.360 align:start position:0%
as as the chair indicated in addition to
 
00:23:38.789 --> 00:23:38.799 align:start position:0%
the thousands of hours of clinical
 
00:23:40.789 --> 00:23:40.799 align:start position:0%
work that they do before they
 
00:23:42.789 --> 00:23:42.799 align:start position:0%
are licensed they also do have a
 
00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
rotation in various specialties i would
 
00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:47.360 align:start position:0%
also submit that
 
00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
we're not changing anything that's
 
00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:50.480 align:start position:0%
happening right now so the scenario that
 
00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
you present is exactly what's been
 
00:23:55.269 --> 00:23:55.279 align:start position:0%
happening for decades we're not changing
 
00:23:57.990 --> 00:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
anything here so right now
 
00:24:00.070 --> 00:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
you could go to your ent and you might
 
00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
have a brand new
 
00:24:05.029 --> 00:24:05.039 align:start position:0%
pa who you're seeing um but that pa has
 
00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
been as i've said had thousands of hours
 
00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:09.200 align:start position:0%
of training they've had the specialty
 
00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:12.240 align:start position:0%
training and that that physician who has
 
00:24:15.269 --> 00:24:15.279 align:start position:0%
employed that pa um is going to be if
 
00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
especially if they're new um they'll be
 
00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:20.320 align:start position:0%
a lot more inclined to uh be watching
 
00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:22.240 align:start position:0%
over them and you know they won't be
 
00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:24.240 align:start position:0%
taking the training wheels if you off
 
00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:26.320 align:start position:0%
off if you will so again we're not
 
00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
changing this bill doesn't change what's
 
00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
happening right now
 
00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:30.390 align:start position:0%
happening right now
um

00:24:30.390 --> 00:24:30.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
and and so i hope that that provides
 
00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
some some confidence so yeah
 
00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:39.520 align:start position:0%
yeah so i i i understand that the
 
00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:42.640 align:start position:0%
procedure can be the same if the if the
 
00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:44.480 align:start position:0%
physician is
 
00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:45.269 align:start position:0%
physician is
um

00:24:45.269 --> 00:24:45.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:48.789 --> 00:24:48.799 align:start position:0%
adequately i'll use the word supervise
 
00:24:51.669 --> 00:24:51.679 align:start position:0%
for for that new pa
 
00:24:55.110 --> 00:24:55.120 align:start position:0%
but it kind of seems like it takes
 
00:24:56.710 --> 00:24:56.720 align:start position:0%
the liability
 
00:24:59.029 --> 00:24:59.039 align:start position:0%
and if and if he's not well trained the
 
00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:01.360 align:start position:0%
physician assistant may do something
 
00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:04.480 align:start position:0%
incorrectly and cause a issue
 
00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:06.240 align:start position:0%
because he wasn't trained that's why
 
00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
they have liability insurance
 
00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
and that's why the
 
00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:11.430 align:start position:0%
and that's why the
practice

00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:11.440 align:start position:0%
practice
 
00:25:13.909 --> 00:25:13.919 align:start position:0%
if the physician the supervising
 
00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
physician is involved they are also
 
00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:17.909 align:start position:0%
physician is involved they are also
liable

00:25:17.909 --> 00:25:17.919 align:start position:0%
liable
 
00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
so i again so
 
00:25:22.390 --> 00:25:22.400 align:start position:0%
the this would apply to
 
00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:23.750 align:start position:0%
the this would apply to
um

00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
a nurse practitioner
 
00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:29.440 align:start position:0%
uh or a pa at some point everyone is new
 
00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
and and i'm not even talking about
 
00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:32.480 align:start position:0%
what's in the bill this the bill
 
00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
represents what is current law the only
 
00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
thing the bill changes about
 
00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:38.960 align:start position:0%
uh any regulation
 
00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
is that we're not sending a document to
 
00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
concord anymore we're keeping it uh at
 
00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:46.640 align:start position:0%
work we're taking two documents that
 
00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:48.320 align:start position:0%
must exist
 
00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:50.320 align:start position:0%
per law and regulation and we're
 
00:25:52.149 --> 00:25:52.159 align:start position:0%
combining them and we're just saying
 
00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
they need to be kept at the
 
00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
um at the practice and that's that's all
 
00:25:58.149 --> 00:25:58.159 align:start position:0%
the bill does so right now there's a
 
00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
practic all pas must have a practice
 
00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
agreement with their employer if it's an
 
00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:04.320 align:start position:0%
ent or whoever uh right now that
 
00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:06.240 align:start position:0%
practice agreement is kept on file for
 
00:26:09.669 --> 00:26:09.679 align:start position:0%
inspection um at the place of employment
 
00:26:09.679 --> 00:26:10.549 align:start position:0%
inspection um at the place of employment
the

00:26:10.549 --> 00:26:10.559 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:26:13.350 --> 00:26:13.360 align:start position:0%
their responsible supervising physician
 
00:26:15.909 --> 00:26:15.919 align:start position:0%
is a separate piece of paper and that is
 
00:26:17.909 --> 00:26:17.919 align:start position:0%
sent into the board of medicine all the
 
00:26:19.669 --> 00:26:19.679 align:start position:0%
bill is doing is taking those two things
 
00:26:21.669 --> 00:26:21.679 align:start position:0%
and combining them and combining and
 
00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
calling them a collaboration agreement
 
00:26:26.149 --> 00:26:26.159 align:start position:0%
so nothing is changing between what's in
 
00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
current law
 
00:26:30.149 --> 00:26:30.159 align:start position:0%
what's happening now and going forward
 
00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
and and again the the way that pas
 
00:26:35.909 --> 00:26:35.919 align:start position:0%
uh or nurse practitioners or any health
 
00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:38.480 align:start position:0%
care provider provides care
 
00:26:40.789 --> 00:26:40.799 align:start position:0%
and and how much what they're allowed to
 
00:26:43.669 --> 00:26:43.679 align:start position:0%
do uh will not change under this bill
 
00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representative lekis thank you
 
00:26:52.549 --> 00:26:52.559 align:start position:0%
um so concerning the uh professional
 
00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
liability insurance coverage i'm just
 
00:26:57.510 --> 00:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
wondering if um
 
00:26:59.510 --> 00:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
this i mean whether the pas that are
 
00:27:01.269 --> 00:27:01.279 align:start position:0%
currently practicing or either required
 
00:27:02.549 --> 00:27:02.559 align:start position:0%
to have this
 
00:27:04.149 --> 00:27:04.159 align:start position:0%
for other reasons or whether they pretty
 
00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
much universally do what i'm getting at
 
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.510 align:start position:0%
much universally do what i'm getting at
is

00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
is this a change for any existing pas
 
00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:17.120 align:start position:0%
so the answer is yes and no if if i may
 
00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
right now no health care provider
 
00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
is required to cover any
 
00:27:24.389 --> 00:27:24.399 align:start position:0%
professional liability insurance
 
00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:27.520 align:start position:0%
malpractice insurance
 
00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:28.470 align:start position:0%
malpractice insurance
period

00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:28.480 align:start position:0%
period
 
00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:31.360 align:start position:0%
in state law or regs no one is required
 
00:27:32.549 --> 00:27:32.559 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
00:27:35.029 --> 00:27:35.039 align:start position:0%
this bill would be a first this would
 
00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:36.480 align:start position:0%
require that
 
00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:39.200 align:start position:0%
of pas and pas only
 
00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:42.720 align:start position:0%
uh and the and this was at the um
 
00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:45.200 align:start position:0%
suggestion of the trial lawyers that
 
00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
came up during the senate and so uh the
 
00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:48.870 align:start position:0%
came up during the senate and so uh the
pas

00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
pas
 
00:27:51.269 --> 00:27:51.279 align:start position:0%
uh because and now to get to your other
 
00:27:51.279 --> 00:27:52.070 align:start position:0%
uh because and now to get to your other
point

00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:53.430 align:start position:0%
point
um

00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:53.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:54.710 align:start position:0%
um
and

00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:54.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:27:56.789 --> 00:27:56.799 align:start position:0%
you the p anyone would be foolish to not
 
00:27:56.799 --> 00:27:57.590 align:start position:0%
you the p anyone would be foolish to not
have

00:27:57.590 --> 00:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:28:00.149 --> 00:28:00.159 align:start position:0%
adequate liability insurance but as the
 
00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
trial lawyers point out point out there
 
00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:04.880 align:start position:0%
are the foolish among us uh and by the
 
00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:08.240 align:start position:0%
way in this instance uh no physician
 
00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:10.480 align:start position:0%
would be foolish to sign
 
00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:12.320 align:start position:0%
an agreement with the pa if it's the
 
00:28:15.669 --> 00:28:15.679 align:start position:0%
current uh rsp or the collaboration
 
00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
agreement uh proposed in this bill same
 
00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:18.710 align:start position:0%
agreement uh proposed in this bill same
difference

00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
difference
 
00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:20.480 align:start position:0%
uh without
 
00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:22.240 align:start position:0%
they would never sign an agreement with
 
00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
a pa that doesn't have adequate
 
00:28:26.549 --> 00:28:26.559 align:start position:0%
liability insurance but nonetheless as
 
00:28:27.909 --> 00:28:27.919 align:start position:0%
we all sit here in this room we think
 
00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:30.240 align:start position:0%
that that would be the case but there
 
00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:32.480 align:start position:0%
are instances where people uh have not
 
00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
so the physician assistants agreed in an
 
00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:38.320 align:start position:0%
effort to maintain consensus on the bill
 
00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
to accept
 
00:28:43.669 --> 00:28:43.679 align:start position:0%
uh a liability a requirement law that uh
 
00:28:45.430 --> 00:28:45.440 align:start position:0%
that they carry adequate professional
 
00:28:47.029 --> 00:28:47.039 align:start position:0%
liability insurance and that the
 
00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
definition of adequate be determined in
 
00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
rulemaking by the board of medicine
 
00:28:53.269 --> 00:28:53.279 align:start position:0%
the physician assistants would love to
 
00:28:55.909 --> 00:28:55.919 align:start position:0%
see that apply to all health care
 
00:28:57.510 --> 00:28:57.520 align:start position:0%
providers as you might expect i don't
 
00:28:58.470 --> 00:28:58.480 align:start position:0%
they don't think that they should be
 
00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
singled out but uh being quite candid
 
00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:02.720 align:start position:0%
with your representative uh we agreed to
 
00:29:04.389 --> 00:29:04.399 align:start position:0%
this change that was put forth by the
 
00:29:06.389 --> 00:29:06.399 align:start position:0%
trial lawyers in an effort to make to
 
00:29:08.389 --> 00:29:08.399 align:start position:0%
maintain consensus on this bill all
 
00:29:09.510 --> 00:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
right thank you
 
00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:12.880 align:start position:0%
representative judy
 
00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:14.960 align:start position:0%
good morning sir morning
 
00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
can you please explain me the difference
 
00:29:19.990 --> 00:29:20.000 align:start position:0%
between a pa
 
00:29:23.029 --> 00:29:23.039 align:start position:0%
and a nurse practitioner
 
00:29:24.789 --> 00:29:24.799 align:start position:0%
sure well
 
00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:26.720 align:start position:0%
the nurse practitioners were trained as
 
00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:27.990 align:start position:0%
the nurse practitioners were trained as
nurses

00:29:27.990 --> 00:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
nurses
 
00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:31.360 align:start position:0%
um pas and i'm i'm generalizing here so
 
00:29:32.789 --> 00:29:32.799 align:start position:0%
bear with me and again
 
00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:36.320 align:start position:0%
um i'm just i'm just the lobbyist so um
 
00:29:38.789 --> 00:29:38.799 align:start position:0%
uh i i will uh i will let you know if i
 
00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:40.640 align:start position:0%
if i think i'm
 
00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
saying something i believe i know to be
 
00:29:44.789 --> 00:29:44.799 align:start position:0%
the case but nurse practitioners were
 
00:29:46.710 --> 00:29:46.720 align:start position:0%
trained as nurses and then they went on
 
00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
to get the extra
 
00:29:50.389 --> 00:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
the extra education and training to be
 
00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
nurse practitioners
 
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:52.950 align:start position:0%
nurse practitioners
they

00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:29:55.029 --> 00:29:55.039 align:start position:0%
they come out of and they can practice
 
00:29:58.230 --> 00:29:58.240 align:start position:0%
independently with no no supervise no no
 
00:29:59.669 --> 00:29:59.679 align:start position:0%
supervision agreement or anything like
 
00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
that they can open their own practice
 
00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:02.960 align:start position:0%
day one out of school
 
00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:05.120 align:start position:0%
physician assistants are trained in the
 
00:30:06.789 --> 00:30:06.799 align:start position:0%
physician model i'm not saying they're
 
00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:08.240 align:start position:0%
trained as physicians i want to be very
 
00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:10.480 align:start position:0%
clear on that but they are trained and
 
00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:12.480 align:start position:0%
there's folks in the room that can uh
 
00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:14.480 align:start position:0%
that can correct me but they are trained
 
00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:16.240 align:start position:0%
in the physician model
 
00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh and they go through
 
00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.110 align:start position:0%
uh and they go through
um

00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:19.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
and i'm not saying that nurses don't
 
00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
just you know speaking more to what the
 
00:30:25.029 --> 00:30:25.039 align:start position:0%
pas do in that physician model
 
00:30:27.029 --> 00:30:27.039 align:start position:0%
uh they go through all the various
 
00:30:29.669 --> 00:30:29.679 align:start position:0%
rotations the clinical hours uh et
 
00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:32.320 align:start position:0%
cetera they just simply don't have
 
00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
the extent of the education
 
00:30:37.669 --> 00:30:37.679 align:start position:0%
uh and whatnot that a physician does and
 
00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
so that i think it but of course when
 
00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
they're done with their education
 
00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:44.720 align:start position:0%
uh they are not allowed to practice
 
00:30:46.389 --> 00:30:46.399 align:start position:0%
uh independently
 
00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
at any point in time uh in some states
 
00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
that's changed they are allowed at
 
00:30:52.149 --> 00:30:52.159 align:start position:0%
either immediately or at some point in
 
00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:54.480 align:start position:0%
time to practice independently uh
 
00:30:56.870 --> 00:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
not not the case uh not the case with
 
00:30:59.029 --> 00:30:59.039 align:start position:0%
with this bill uh currently or going
 
00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
forward uh that is that's the real
 
00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:03.440 align:start position:0%
difference it's really just that
 
00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
there is two different education models
 
00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
you know nursing versus the physician
 
00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
model and then there's the um and then
 
00:31:11.430 --> 00:31:11.440 align:start position:0%
there's the fact that when they're when
 
00:31:13.909 --> 00:31:13.919 align:start position:0%
they're out of school pas can't practice
 
00:31:15.909 --> 00:31:15.919 align:start position:0%
uh independently
 
00:31:17.509 --> 00:31:17.519 align:start position:0%
thank you representative you had a
 
00:31:17.519 --> 00:31:18.470 align:start position:0%
thank you representative you had a
question

00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
uh mr kazi i was concerned about
 
00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
liability for this reason and you've
 
00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
uncovered it the truck could it be that
 
00:31:28.549 --> 00:31:28.559 align:start position:0%
the trial lawyers are insisting on this
 
00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:30.640 align:start position:0%
coverage because doctors have more
 
00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
assets than a physician's assistant
 
00:31:35.029 --> 00:31:35.039 align:start position:0%
might represent
 
00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:37.440 align:start position:0%
please do not speculate on people's
 
00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:39.269 align:start position:0%
please do not speculate on people's
motivations

00:31:39.269 --> 00:31:39.279 align:start position:0%
motivations
 
00:31:43.269 --> 00:31:43.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:31:48.630 --> 00:31:48.640 align:start position:0%
so in essence since this bill really
 
00:31:50.630 --> 00:31:50.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't change the way people
 
00:31:53.430 --> 00:31:53.440 align:start position:0%
be between physician assistants or
 
00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:54.950 align:start position:0%
be between physician assistants or
practicing

00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
practicing
 
00:31:56.310 --> 00:31:56.320 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:59.029 align:start position:0%
this bill
therefore

00:31:59.029 --> 00:31:59.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:59.990 --> 00:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
you a
 
00:32:02.149 --> 00:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
thousand foot view
 
00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
is removing the board of medicine
 
00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:09.990 align:start position:0%
is removing the board of medicine
from

00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
certification of these
 
00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:14.310 align:start position:0%
certification of these
these

00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:14.320 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:32:17.029 --> 00:32:17.039 align:start position:0%
physician assistants and
 
00:32:18.789 --> 00:32:18.799 align:start position:0%
the relationship between the board of
 
00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:21.200 align:start position:0%
assistant board of medicine will be
 
00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:23.360 align:start position:0%
between the physician who has signed
 
00:32:26.549 --> 00:32:26.559 align:start position:0%
this collaboration document with the
 
00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:30.720 align:start position:0%
physician assistant is that correct uh
 
00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
if i may uh
 
00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:33.590 align:start position:0%
if i may uh
uh

00:32:33.590 --> 00:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
not exactly
 
00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
the board of the board of medicine does
 
00:32:39.909 --> 00:32:39.919 align:start position:0%
not in any way shape or form
 
00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
approve or certify
 
00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:43.269 align:start position:0%
approve or certify
the

00:32:43.269 --> 00:32:43.279 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:32:45.909 --> 00:32:45.919 align:start position:0%
the current rsp that responsible
 
00:32:48.630 --> 00:32:48.640 align:start position:0%
supervisory uh physician
 
00:32:50.710 --> 00:32:50.720 align:start position:0%
agreement between pas
 
00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
and uh physicians so there's no approval
 
00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:55.440 align:start position:0%
process from the board of medicine right
 
00:32:57.909 --> 00:32:57.919 align:start position:0%
now but uh that regarding that
 
00:33:00.149 --> 00:33:00.159 align:start position:0%
relationship all that happens is that
 
00:33:02.710 --> 00:33:02.720 align:start position:0%
piece of paper gets mailed to concord
 
00:33:04.389 --> 00:33:04.399 align:start position:0%
gets mailed to the mail to the board of
 
00:33:07.509 --> 00:33:07.519 align:start position:0%
medicine uh and is kept on file that's
 
00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:11.440 align:start position:0%
it um there are no uh the board does not
 
00:33:14.549 --> 00:33:14.559 align:start position:0%
that uh certify any uh edu
 
00:33:17.029 --> 00:33:17.039 align:start position:0%
educational uh programming or anything
 
00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:20.240 align:start position:0%
along lower accreditation of pas there
 
00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:22.720 align:start position:0%
is a pa on the board of medicine
 
00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:24.720 align:start position:0%
uh the board of medicine not
 
00:33:26.950 --> 00:33:26.960 align:start position:0%
they maintain all of their regulatory
 
00:33:29.509 --> 00:33:29.519 align:start position:0%
authority over pas under this bill
 
00:33:31.669 --> 00:33:31.679 align:start position:0%
the only thing that changes in terms of
 
00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
what the pa what the board of medicine
 
00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
does or doesn't do is that they now
 
00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:38.480 align:start position:0%
don't get that piece of paper
 
00:33:40.470 --> 00:33:40.480 align:start position:0%
that piece of paper would be combined
 
00:33:41.830 --> 00:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
with the practice agreement and just
 
00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
simply kept on file at the at the place
 
00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
of employment
 
00:33:47.590 --> 00:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
i must have i i'm sorry i rephrased i
 
00:33:52.710 --> 00:33:52.720 align:start position:0%
phrased my question incorrectly okay
 
00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
so the bill repeals the rulemaking
 
00:33:56.950 --> 00:33:56.960 align:start position:0%
authority of the board of medicine
 
00:33:59.509 --> 00:33:59.519 align:start position:0%
it repeals several things why is that
 
00:33:59.519 --> 00:34:00.789 align:start position:0%
it repeals several things why is that
necessary

00:34:00.789 --> 00:34:00.799 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
00:34:00.799 --> 00:34:01.830 align:start position:0%
necessary
well

00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:34:03.990 --> 00:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
because um
 
00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
so i think you're referring to the last
 
00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:07.600 align:start position:0%
page of the bill
 
00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:13.829 align:start position:0%
page of the bill
um

00:34:13.829 --> 00:34:13.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:15.030 --> 00:34:15.040 align:start position:0%
so this
 
00:34:18.069 --> 00:34:18.079 align:start position:0%
a lot of these are being repealed
 
00:34:18.079 --> 00:34:19.270 align:start position:0%
a lot of these are being repealed
um

00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:19.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:21.270 --> 00:34:21.280 align:start position:0%
because they're not they're not needed
 
00:34:23.829 --> 00:34:23.839 align:start position:0%
so for example um if you go to the front
 
00:34:25.669 --> 00:34:25.679 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
00:34:25.679 --> 00:34:30.710 align:start position:0%
of the bill
um

00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:32.950 --> 00:34:32.960 align:start position:0%
with continuing education
 
00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:40.950 --> 00:34:40.960 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying i'm sorry i wasn't uh
 
00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to answer your question
 
00:34:44.950 --> 00:34:44.960 align:start position:0%
accurately without misspeaking uh or
 
00:34:46.149 --> 00:34:46.159 align:start position:0%
with uh
 
00:34:48.310 --> 00:34:48.320 align:start position:0%
any kind of mentions on page two of the
 
00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
bill for example
 
00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:52.710 align:start position:0%
bill for example
um

00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:55.109 --> 00:34:55.119 align:start position:0%
on line 20 this committee on allied
 
00:34:57.109 --> 00:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
health education and accreditation that
 
00:34:58.950 --> 00:34:58.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't that doesn't exist so that is
 
00:35:00.870 --> 00:35:00.880 align:start position:0%
the rule-making authority those
 
00:35:02.950 --> 00:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
rule-making authorities are what are
 
00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:04.960 align:start position:0%
being repealed
 
00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:06.550 align:start position:0%
being repealed
um

00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:06.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:07.349 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:35:07.349 --> 00:35:07.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:08.960 align:start position:0%
those are the those are the issues that
 
00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
are being addressed
 
00:35:12.630 --> 00:35:12.640 align:start position:0%
in terms of rulemaking that um are
 
00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:14.720 align:start position:0%
stipulated further in the bill it's just
 
00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:16.960 align:start position:0%
to conform with what's being said
 
00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
elsewhere in the bill
 
00:35:22.470 --> 00:35:22.480 align:start position:0%
if if i hope i'm being clear i apologize
 
00:35:25.750 --> 00:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
no you are thank you thank you
 
00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:35:30.310 --> 00:35:30.320 align:start position:0%
uh yeah that was my question is does the
 
00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
board of medicine have general
 
00:35:33.990 --> 00:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
rule-making authority over physician
 
00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.109 align:start position:0%
rule-making authority over physician

yes ma'am okay because these
 
00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:40.240 align:start position:0%
these appear to be very specific
 
00:35:42.550 --> 00:35:42.560 align:start position:0%
and the bill
 
00:35:44.470 --> 00:35:44.480 align:start position:0%
puts them in statute rather than in
 
00:35:46.870 --> 00:35:46.880 align:start position:0%

00:36:22.870 --> 00:36:22.880 align:start position:0%
i want to thank or excuse me i want to
 
00:36:24.790 --> 00:36:24.800 align:start position:0%
start by thanking the new hampshire
 
00:36:26.390 --> 00:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
society of physician assistants for
 
00:36:29.589 --> 00:36:29.599 align:start position:0%
coming to us uh last fall to discuss
 
00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
this bill um since i've been in this
 
00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
role since 2018
 
00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:35.200 align:start position:0%
we worked very very closely with the
 
00:36:37.430 --> 00:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
physician assistants to make a couple
 
00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:38.800 align:start position:0%
common sense
 
00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
changes the statute
 
00:36:43.109 --> 00:36:43.119 align:start position:0%
into rules a couple examples of that
 
00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
were removing ratio requirements that
 
00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
pas and physicians had
 
00:36:49.990 --> 00:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
and then also removing the requirement
 
00:36:53.270 --> 00:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
for a pa to have an rsp named prior to
 
00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:55.440 align:start position:0%
licensure so um when they came to us
 
00:36:56.790 --> 00:36:56.800 align:start position:0%
with this bill you know we really wanted
 
00:36:58.550 --> 00:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
to figure out a way to
 
00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
work with them and and and um
 
00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
understand the things that they were
 
00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:04.480 align:start position:0%
trying to accomplish with it and and
 
00:37:05.829 --> 00:37:05.839 align:start position:0%
figure out how we kind of bring all the
 
00:37:07.510 --> 00:37:07.520 align:start position:0%
different stakeholders together to to
 
00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
come to an agreement and i do think that
 
00:37:12.310 --> 00:37:12.320 align:start position:0%
this amended version of this bill
 
00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
does reflect uh the concerns and and the
 
00:37:17.430 --> 00:37:17.440 align:start position:0%
changes that all of those stakeholders
 
00:37:20.950 --> 00:37:20.960 align:start position:0%
um wanted to make um so i i'll be brief
 
00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:23.440 align:start position:0%
and and i don't want to be redundant i
 
00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
think senator bradley and i think mr cuz
 
00:37:26.950 --> 00:37:26.960 align:start position:0%
he did a good job of explaining what's
 
00:37:29.589 --> 00:37:29.599 align:start position:0%
in this bill uh so i'll just thank the
 
00:37:31.270 --> 00:37:31.280 align:start position:0%
committee for their time and would be
 
00:37:33.109 --> 00:37:33.119 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions that folks
 
00:37:35.589 --> 00:37:35.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:38.470 --> 00:37:38.480 align:start position:0%
thank you representative scitec uh this
 
00:37:40.310 --> 00:37:40.320 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if this is for you or mr
 
00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
cuzzy who this agreement that don't no
 
00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:45.200 align:start position:0%
longer get sent to conquer the rsp i
 
00:37:48.069 --> 00:37:48.079 align:start position:0%
guess is now kept in a file cabinet in
 
00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:50.720 align:start position:0%
the physician's office uh
 
00:37:52.710 --> 00:37:52.720 align:start position:0%
medical practice who actually gets to
 
00:37:54.630 --> 00:37:54.640 align:start position:0%
see it what's the purpose of it if it is
 
00:37:56.150 --> 00:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
who examines it
 
00:37:57.829 --> 00:37:57.839 align:start position:0%
so i think my understanding would be
 
00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
that that document is required to be
 
00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:00.870 align:start position:0%
that that document is required to be
held

00:38:00.870 --> 00:38:00.880 align:start position:0%
held
 
00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:03.040 align:start position:0%
if the board of medicine does request it
 
00:38:05.109 --> 00:38:05.119 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:38:08.069 --> 00:38:08.079 align:start position:0%
you know prior i believe um the the rsp
 
00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:10.160 align:start position:0%
that was sent to the board of medicine
 
00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
um to be kept on file there
 
00:38:13.990 --> 00:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
in this new revised edition i believe
 
00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:15.520 align:start position:0%
the board of medicine has been consulted
 
00:38:16.790 --> 00:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
on this
 
00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:18.560 align:start position:0%
they don't need to have that unless they
 
00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:20.960 align:start position:0%
do request it so if they request it then
 
00:38:22.870 --> 00:38:22.880 align:start position:0%
then that collaboration agreement can be
 
00:38:25.109 --> 00:38:25.119 align:start position:0%
sent to them
 
00:38:27.349 --> 00:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
yes follow-up
 
00:38:30.069 --> 00:38:30.079 align:start position:0%
does the bill say that
 
00:38:32.069 --> 00:38:32.079 align:start position:0%
they have the right to who has the right
 
00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:34.480 align:start position:0%
to see this by statute i believe it does
 
00:38:37.349 --> 00:38:37.359 align:start position:0%
say in statute that um upon request uh
 
00:38:38.790 --> 00:38:38.800 align:start position:0%
will be sent to the board of medicine i
 
00:38:40.069 --> 00:38:40.079 align:start position:0%
can double check that but i believe it's
 
00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
in there
 
00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:42.390 align:start position:0%
in there
it's

00:38:42.390 --> 00:38:42.400 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:38:47.990 --> 00:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
representative pearson
 
00:38:51.750 --> 00:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair the agreement that
 
00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:52.790 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair the agreement that
we're

00:38:52.790 --> 00:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
we're
 
00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:54.800 align:start position:0%
beating to death here is that something
 
00:38:58.150 --> 00:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
that an insurance carrier would require
 
00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
to see as part of their
 
00:39:01.670 --> 00:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
i mean i know you're not an insurance
 
00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
guy but is that
 
00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
is that logical i appreciate the
 
00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:06.880 align:start position:0%
question i don't know if i can really
 
00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:08.720 align:start position:0%
answer that um
 
00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:14.310 --> 00:39:14.320 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair and thank you
 
00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:16.160 align:start position:0%
mike for taking my question i'm asking
 
00:39:17.670 --> 00:39:17.680 align:start position:0%
this although i think i know the answer
 
00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:18.880 align:start position:0%
because i think it needs to be on the
 
00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:20.230 align:start position:0%
because i think it needs to be on the
record

00:39:20.230 --> 00:39:20.240 align:start position:0%
record
 
00:39:22.390 --> 00:39:22.400 align:start position:0%
my understanding as a hospital trustee
 
00:39:25.589 --> 00:39:25.599 align:start position:0%
is that sometimes it is difficult to get
 
00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
physicians to agree to sign these
 
00:39:29.589 --> 00:39:29.599 align:start position:0%
collaborative practice agreements for a
 
00:39:32.069 --> 00:39:32.079 align:start position:0%
variety of reasons
 
00:39:35.829 --> 00:39:35.839 align:start position:0%
will this bill address our difficulty as
 
00:39:37.349 --> 00:39:37.359 align:start position:0%
a hospital in
 
00:39:39.270 --> 00:39:39.280 align:start position:0%
attracting physicians assistants because
 
00:39:41.910 --> 00:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
we will no longer have that difficulty i
 
00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:43.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i certainly
 
00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:44.640 align:start position:0%
would hope so you know i think one of
 
00:39:46.069 --> 00:39:46.079 align:start position:0%
the the goals of the physician
 
00:39:48.310 --> 00:39:48.320 align:start position:0%
assistants in proposing this legislation
 
00:39:51.270 --> 00:39:51.280 align:start position:0%
uh to start was to hopefully streamline
 
00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:53.920 align:start position:0%
that process and and make that um
 
00:39:55.910 --> 00:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
that hiring process a little bit easier
 
00:39:57.430 --> 00:39:57.440 align:start position:0%
for physician assistants and that
 
00:39:59.510 --> 00:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
relationship between pas and physicians
 
00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
a little bit more streamlined so i
 
00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
certainly would would hope that that is
 
00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
the case
 
00:40:06.069 --> 00:40:06.079 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:08.240 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions
 
00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:10.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much appreciate that
 
00:40:24.069 --> 00:40:24.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
good morning madam chair members of the
 
00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:26.800 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is
 
00:40:28.470 --> 00:40:28.480 align:start position:0%
marissa chase i represent the new
 
00:40:29.990 --> 00:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire association for justice which
 
00:40:31.589 --> 00:40:31.599 align:start position:0%
is a euphemism for the trial lawyers
 
00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:33.680 align:start position:0%
association we are a statewide
 
00:40:34.870 --> 00:40:34.880 align:start position:0%
professional association of
 
00:40:37.109 --> 00:40:37.119 align:start position:0%
approximately 400 attorneys focusing on
 
00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
represented plaintiffs and plaintiff's
 
00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:40.230 align:start position:0%
represented plaintiffs and plaintiff's
rights

00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:40.240 align:start position:0%
rights
 
00:40:42.230 --> 00:40:42.240 align:start position:0%
i wasn't planning on speaking today i
 
00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:44.480 align:start position:0%
appreciate the physician's assistance
 
00:40:46.309 --> 00:40:46.319 align:start position:0%
and the medical society and the hospital
 
00:40:48.550 --> 00:40:48.560 align:start position:0%
association all the hours that they have
 
00:40:50.550 --> 00:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
taken to talk with us and come to
 
00:40:52.870 --> 00:40:52.880 align:start position:0%
consensus i do believe the bill before
 
00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
you as a result of that consensus i just
 
00:40:57.910 --> 00:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to point out a couple um
 
00:41:00.790 --> 00:41:00.800 align:start position:0%
a couple points based on questions that
 
00:41:02.150 --> 00:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
i heard of committee members if that's
 
00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:03.680 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:41:06.390 --> 00:41:06.400 align:start position:0%
nhaj is neutral on the bill you know i
 
00:41:08.790 --> 00:41:08.800 align:start position:0%
think any expansion of access to health
 
00:41:10.870 --> 00:41:10.880 align:start position:0%
care for patients in new hampshire is a
 
00:41:12.550 --> 00:41:12.560 align:start position:0%
good thing
 
00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
but i think it's important to recognize
 
00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:14.870 align:start position:0%
but i think it's important to recognize
that

00:41:14.870 --> 00:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:41:16.950 --> 00:41:16.960 align:start position:0%
pas inherent in their title physicians
 
00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:18.800 align:start position:0%
assistants and other mid-level health
 
00:41:20.950 --> 00:41:20.960 align:start position:0%
care providers were never intended in
 
00:41:23.109 --> 00:41:23.119 align:start position:0%
our overall regulatory and statutory and
 
00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:24.640 align:start position:0%
licensing schemes to practice
 
00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:26.230 align:start position:0%
licensing schemes to practice
independently

00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:26.240 align:start position:0%
independently
 
00:41:27.510 --> 00:41:27.520 align:start position:0%
so i think it's important to bear in
 
00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:28.390 align:start position:0%
so i think it's important to bear in
mind

00:41:28.390 --> 00:41:28.400 align:start position:0%
mind
 
00:41:30.870 --> 00:41:30.880 align:start position:0%
those are the reasons why we requested
 
00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:32.640 align:start position:0%
those changes adequate liability
 
00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
coverage is typically in a requirement
 
00:41:38.069 --> 00:41:38.079 align:start position:0%
in a hospital's credentialing agreement
 
00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
so that's how it happens now by calling
 
00:41:44.069 --> 00:41:44.079 align:start position:0%
it out in statute because there it's
 
00:41:45.589 --> 00:41:45.599 align:start position:0%
foreseeable that some physician
 
00:41:47.270 --> 00:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
assistants would no longer be under the
 
00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
umbrella of a hospital as they typically
 
00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
are now
 
00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
we felt it appropriate we were very
 
00:41:54.309 --> 00:41:54.319 align:start position:0%
happy that they agreed to that change
 
00:41:56.230 --> 00:41:56.240 align:start position:0%
as mr cussey said you know it would be
 
00:41:57.990 --> 00:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
foolish in this day and age for someone
 
00:42:00.870 --> 00:42:00.880 align:start position:0%
to not cover adequate liability coverage
 
00:42:02.790 --> 00:42:02.800 align:start position:0%
unfortunately our members have seen that
 
00:42:04.309 --> 00:42:04.319 align:start position:0%
to be true
 
00:42:06.390 --> 00:42:06.400 align:start position:0%
and that is only when a patient is so
 
00:42:08.390 --> 00:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
egregiously harmed by the act of a
 
00:42:10.470 --> 00:42:10.480 align:start position:0%
health care provider which is rare i
 
00:42:11.829 --> 00:42:11.839 align:start position:0%
want to point out it's exceedingly
 
00:42:13.829 --> 00:42:13.839 align:start position:0%
difficult to bring a medical malpractice
 
00:42:15.750 --> 00:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
suit especially in new hampshire we have
 
00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
very conservative juries and verdicts we
 
00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
what's the word pune punitive damages in
 
00:42:24.950 --> 00:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
new hampshire so that keeps our jury
 
00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
verdicts low
 
00:42:29.430 --> 00:42:29.440 align:start position:0%
and i also want to point out especially
 
00:42:30.870 --> 00:42:30.880 align:start position:0%
with this committee that i haven't been
 
00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:32.640 align:start position:0%
before you before
 
00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:35.440 align:start position:0%
especially with the pandemic
 
00:42:36.870 --> 00:42:36.880 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire how a plaintiff's
 
00:42:39.109 --> 00:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
lawyer brings a civil suit they take it
 
00:42:41.190 --> 00:42:41.200 align:start position:0%
on what's called contingency fee that
 
00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
means that the lawyer does not get paid
 
00:42:46.230 --> 00:42:46.240 align:start position:0%
if and unless they prevail which means
 
00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
that they are financially um
 
00:42:51.510 --> 00:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
incented to not take a case that doesn't
 
00:42:53.829 --> 00:42:53.839 align:start position:0%
have very clear liability
 
00:42:56.230 --> 00:42:56.240 align:start position:0%
or high damages you know potential
 
00:42:58.550 --> 00:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
future loss of income loss of enjoyment
 
00:43:01.030 --> 00:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
of life etc
 
00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
contingency fee also means that a lawyer
 
00:43:04.950 --> 00:43:04.960 align:start position:0%
fronts all the costs of litigation up
 
00:43:06.390 --> 00:43:06.400 align:start position:0%
front that means that they are
 
00:43:08.390 --> 00:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
responsible for fronting the costs of
 
00:43:10.069 --> 00:43:10.079 align:start position:0%
experts going through testimony
 
00:43:12.069 --> 00:43:12.079 align:start position:0%
deposition we're talking thousands and
 
00:43:14.309 --> 00:43:14.319 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars so we do not have a
 
00:43:16.710 --> 00:43:16.720 align:start position:0%
frivolous lawsuit issue in new hampshire
 
00:43:19.270 --> 00:43:19.280 align:start position:0%
um i just wanted to you know kind of
 
00:43:20.790 --> 00:43:20.800 align:start position:0%
clarify that for the record and i'd be
 
00:43:23.190 --> 00:43:23.200 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions
 
00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:25.280 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative marsh
 
00:43:26.790 --> 00:43:26.800 align:start position:0%
and please don't ask questions you know
 
00:43:29.589 --> 00:43:29.599 align:start position:0%
the answers to
 
00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
okay well that might make it difficult
 
00:43:34.150 --> 00:43:34.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming to testify before
 
00:43:36.550 --> 00:43:36.560 align:start position:0%
us today uh as this bill is written are
 
00:43:38.069 --> 00:43:38.079 align:start position:0%
the collaborative practice agreements
 
00:43:40.550 --> 00:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
discoverable if the case goes to trial
 
00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
that i don't know
 
00:43:43.030 --> 00:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to follow up with the
 
00:43:45.589 --> 00:43:45.599 align:start position:0%
committee i would appreciate that
 
00:43:45.599 --> 00:43:46.870 align:start position:0%
committee i would appreciate that
okay

00:43:46.870 --> 00:43:46.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
00:43:51.430 --> 00:43:51.440 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for waiting excuse
 
00:43:54.550 --> 00:43:54.560 align:start position:0%
me representative fellows
 
00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:55.349 align:start position:0%
me representative fellows
so

00:43:55.349 --> 00:43:55.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:43:58.790 --> 00:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
so right now if a physician's assistant
 
00:44:01.910 --> 00:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
did something that was bad enough that
 
00:44:02.950 --> 00:44:02.960 align:start position:0%
it would
 
00:44:05.030 --> 00:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
there'd be a possibility that they're
 
00:44:07.109 --> 00:44:07.119 align:start position:0%
sued for it
 
00:44:08.790 --> 00:44:08.800 align:start position:0%
can you tell me
 
00:44:11.349 --> 00:44:11.359 align:start position:0%
who they would sue now
 
00:44:11.359 --> 00:44:12.230 align:start position:0%
who they would sue now
and

00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:44:16.069 --> 00:44:16.079 align:start position:0%
how this bill would make that different
 
00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
in it i'm just generally trying to
 
00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
the physicians already always have their
 
00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:22.630 align:start position:0%
the physicians already always have their
own

00:44:22.630 --> 00:44:22.640 align:start position:0%
own
 
00:44:24.950 --> 00:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
insurance or is it sometimes covered by
 
00:44:27.589 --> 00:44:27.599 align:start position:0%
the the hospital or wherever they work
 
00:44:29.990 --> 00:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
who who who covers the liability for all
 
00:44:32.470 --> 00:44:32.480 align:start position:0%
the different options right now sure
 
00:44:33.990 --> 00:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
under this bill
 
00:44:35.190 --> 00:44:35.200 align:start position:0%
so unfortunately i'm going to give you a
 
00:44:36.790 --> 00:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
complicated answer which i don't like
 
00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:38.630 align:start position:0%
complicated answer which i don't like
doing

00:44:38.630 --> 00:44:38.640 align:start position:0%
doing
 
00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:39.589 align:start position:0%
doing
um

00:44:39.589 --> 00:44:39.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:41.750 --> 00:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
it depends i mean it depends on the case
 
00:44:43.589 --> 00:44:43.599 align:start position:0%
the specifics of the case
 
00:44:43.599 --> 00:44:44.630 align:start position:0%
the specifics of the case
um

00:44:44.630 --> 00:44:44.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:47.430 --> 00:44:47.440 align:start position:0%
there's what is a complicating factor i
 
00:44:50.710 --> 00:44:50.720 align:start position:0%
think plaintiff's lawyers get a a bad
 
00:44:53.430 --> 00:44:53.440 align:start position:0%
rap and i get it but plaintiff's lawyers
 
00:44:54.790 --> 00:44:54.800 align:start position:0%
typically get
 
00:44:57.270 --> 00:44:57.280 align:start position:0%
i think blamed with naming so many
 
00:44:58.870 --> 00:44:58.880 align:start position:0%
defendants in a lawsuit like anyone
 
00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
could who could have touched anyone in
 
00:45:01.589 --> 00:45:01.599 align:start position:0%
the process
 
00:45:03.589 --> 00:45:03.599 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire it's not always the
 
00:45:05.349 --> 00:45:05.359 align:start position:0%
plaintiff's attorney who is naming other
 
00:45:07.750 --> 00:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
defendants because we have a case called
 
00:45:09.190 --> 00:45:09.200 align:start position:0%
de benedetto
 
00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
where defend it
 
00:45:12.790 --> 00:45:12.800 align:start position:0%
i'll breeze over it i'd be happy to
 
00:45:15.430 --> 00:45:15.440 align:start position:0%
follow up with the committee with the
 
00:45:17.349 --> 00:45:17.359 align:start position:0%
many pages just the highlights just the
 
00:45:19.510 --> 00:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
highlights a defendant can shift blame
 
00:45:21.430 --> 00:45:21.440 align:start position:0%
onto other defendants and they can name
 
00:45:24.630 --> 00:45:24.640 align:start position:0%
other defendants in a case because say
 
00:45:27.750 --> 00:45:27.760 align:start position:0%
i'm a patient i had surgery i you know
 
00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:30.400 align:start position:0%
they cut off the wrong leg god forbid
 
00:45:33.270 --> 00:45:33.280 align:start position:0%
um the i sue the doctor who did the
 
00:45:35.030 --> 00:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
surgery and the surgeon says well it was
 
00:45:36.870 --> 00:45:36.880 align:start position:0%
actually the radiologist who gave me the
 
00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:38.640 align:start position:0%
wrong information or it was the hospital
 
00:45:39.910 --> 00:45:39.920 align:start position:0%
and they are able to name other
 
00:45:41.270 --> 00:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
defendants so it's not always the
 
00:45:43.349 --> 00:45:43.359 align:start position:0%
plaintiff's lawyer naming all of these
 
00:45:44.870 --> 00:45:44.880 align:start position:0%
parties and bringing everyone in and
 
00:45:47.109 --> 00:45:47.119 align:start position:0%
that's true across the board in civil
 
00:45:49.190 --> 00:45:49.200 align:start position:0%
cases in new hampshire
 
00:45:50.230 --> 00:45:50.240 align:start position:0%
i don't know if that answers your
 
00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:56.230 align:start position:0%
i don't know if that answers your
question

00:45:56.230 --> 00:45:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:59.340 --> 00:45:59.350 align:start position:0%
mr cousins you have a better a
 
00:45:59.350 --> 00:46:02.150 align:start position:0%
mr cousins you have a better a
[Music]

00:46:02.150 --> 00:46:02.160 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:46:03.990 --> 00:46:04.000 align:start position:0%
closer to the question and answer closer
 
00:46:05.990 --> 00:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
to the question yes ma'am
 
00:46:07.349 --> 00:46:07.359 align:start position:0%
please thank you
 
00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:13.829 --> 00:46:13.839 align:start position:0%
pardon me right now a physician
 
00:46:13.839 --> 00:46:15.190 align:start position:0%
pardon me right now a physician
assistant

00:46:15.190 --> 00:46:15.200 align:start position:0%
assistant
 
00:46:17.109 --> 00:46:17.119 align:start position:0%
uh can be sued for the care they
 
00:46:17.119 --> 00:46:18.150 align:start position:0%
uh can be sued for the care they
provided

00:46:18.150 --> 00:46:18.160 align:start position:0%
provided
 
00:46:20.870 --> 00:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
when a physician assistant is sued
 
00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
the physician that is on that what
 
00:46:26.470 --> 00:46:26.480 align:start position:0%
currently is that rsp form
 
00:46:29.589 --> 00:46:29.599 align:start position:0%
can also be sued simply because
 
00:46:31.510 --> 00:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
their name is on that form even if they
 
00:46:33.430 --> 00:46:33.440 align:start position:0%
had nothing to do with the care that was
 
00:46:35.349 --> 00:46:35.359 align:start position:0%
provided um
 
00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:38.480 align:start position:0%
a pa would not be involved in performing
 
00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
surgery necessarily but i'll for
 
00:46:42.710 --> 00:46:42.720 align:start position:0%
simplicity's sake madam chair if you
 
00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:44.640 align:start position:0%
will um
 
00:46:46.950 --> 00:46:46.960 align:start position:0%
say a pa sees someone at a urgent care
 
00:46:49.589 --> 00:46:49.599 align:start position:0%
center because they have a strep throat
 
00:46:51.910 --> 00:46:51.920 align:start position:0%
um and for some reason uh and and
 
00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
there's no reason for the pa they they
 
00:46:55.990 --> 00:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
look at the throat they get they confirm
 
00:46:57.270 --> 00:46:57.280 align:start position:0%
it with strep they provide the
 
00:46:58.870 --> 00:46:58.880 align:start position:0%
antibiotics and that's it a fairly
 
00:47:01.109 --> 00:47:01.119 align:start position:0%
straightforward interaction the pa does
 
00:47:03.430 --> 00:47:03.440 align:start position:0%
not need to consult with anyone on the
 
00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:06.160 align:start position:0%
care of that um
 
00:47:09.349 --> 00:47:09.359 align:start position:0%
but that that patient sues
 
00:47:11.510 --> 00:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
they could certainly sue the pa they can
 
00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
also sue the physician who is the
 
00:47:16.309 --> 00:47:16.319 align:start position:0%
responsible supervisory physician for
 
00:47:18.790 --> 00:47:18.800 align:start position:0%
that pa right now
 
00:47:20.630 --> 00:47:20.640 align:start position:0%
even though that that physician had
 
00:47:21.829 --> 00:47:21.839 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with this basic
 
00:47:23.990 --> 00:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
interaction so what we're saying in this
 
00:47:25.190 --> 00:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
bill is
 
00:47:28.630 --> 00:47:28.640 align:start position:0%
that that may not make sense
 
00:47:30.630 --> 00:47:30.640 align:start position:0%
and so what we're saying is that
 
00:47:33.270 --> 00:47:33.280 align:start position:0%
physician should no longer
 
00:47:35.270 --> 00:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
be able to be sued if they had
 
00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely nothing to do with the case
 
00:47:38.950 --> 00:47:38.960 align:start position:0%
just because their name is on a piece of
 
00:47:40.870 --> 00:47:40.880 align:start position:0%
paper the pa absolutely still will be
 
00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:41.910 align:start position:0%
paper the pa absolutely still will be
sued

00:47:41.910 --> 00:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
sued
 
00:47:44.069 --> 00:47:44.079 align:start position:0%
what the bill makes clear though is that
 
00:47:46.069 --> 00:47:46.079 align:start position:0%
if there was any kind of
 
00:47:47.990 --> 00:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
involvement from
 
00:47:49.910 --> 00:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
that supervisory physician or any
 
00:47:51.589 --> 00:47:51.599 align:start position:0%
physician for that matter
 
00:47:53.190 --> 00:47:53.200 align:start position:0%
if they simply ask the question said
 
00:47:56.309 --> 00:47:56.319 align:start position:0%
geez you know i do see a little of this
 
00:47:58.390 --> 00:47:58.400 align:start position:0%
as i look down their throat
 
00:48:01.109 --> 00:48:01.119 align:start position:0%
right there right then now that brings
 
00:48:03.510 --> 00:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
liability upon the physician and so
 
00:48:05.030 --> 00:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
we're making we're just making clear
 
00:48:06.390 --> 00:48:06.400 align:start position:0%
that just because your name is on a
 
00:48:09.030 --> 00:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
piece of paper you don't get sued but if
 
00:48:10.710 --> 00:48:10.720 align:start position:0%
you have anything to do with the care of
 
00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
that provider you absolutely still are
 
00:48:16.309 --> 00:48:16.319 align:start position:0%
liable for um in that instance
 
00:48:19.430 --> 00:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
pas pas don't lose their
 
00:48:21.349 --> 00:48:21.359 align:start position:0%
don't lose their liability
 
00:48:24.470 --> 00:48:24.480 align:start position:0%
that they have now under this bill
 
00:48:28.870 --> 00:48:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:30.710 --> 00:48:30.720 align:start position:0%
all right and
 
00:48:32.230 --> 00:48:32.240 align:start position:0%
yes representative schmidt
 
00:48:36.630 --> 00:48:36.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:38.069 --> 00:48:38.079 align:start position:0%
does the physician
 
00:48:40.470 --> 00:48:40.480 align:start position:0%
not have to do with that
 
00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:42.230 align:start position:0%
not have to do with that
error

00:48:42.230 --> 00:48:42.240 align:start position:0%
error
 
00:48:43.670 --> 00:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
or damage
 
00:48:49.190 --> 00:48:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:52.390 --> 00:48:52.400 align:start position:0%
no no i think you know that's and
 
00:48:54.150 --> 00:48:54.160 align:start position:0%
correct me if i'm wrong but
 
00:48:57.270 --> 00:48:57.280 align:start position:0%
you know these uh any malpractice type
 
00:48:58.710 --> 00:48:58.720 align:start position:0%
situation is
 
00:49:00.549 --> 00:49:00.559 align:start position:0%
uh is determined based on that
 
00:49:00.559 --> 00:49:02.069 align:start position:0%
uh is determined based on that
interaction

00:49:02.069 --> 00:49:02.079 align:start position:0%
interaction
 
00:49:03.589 --> 00:49:03.599 align:start position:0%
i suppose
 
00:49:03.599 --> 00:49:04.390 align:start position:0%
i suppose
if

00:49:04.390 --> 00:49:04.400 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:49:06.150 --> 00:49:06.160 align:start position:0%
you're talking about a private uh a
 
00:49:07.750 --> 00:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
private practice
 
00:49:09.750 --> 00:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
then if there were a lawsuit of some
 
00:49:12.390 --> 00:49:12.400 align:start position:0%
sort i'm sure that the practice itself
 
00:49:15.910 --> 00:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
would be would be named in a suit but um
 
00:49:17.510 --> 00:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
if you're talking about let's just say
 
00:49:18.950 --> 00:49:18.960 align:start position:0%
someone goes to
 
00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:19.910 align:start position:0%
someone goes to
um

00:49:19.910 --> 00:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:21.750 --> 00:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
the elliot to one of their urgent care
 
00:49:23.589 --> 00:49:23.599 align:start position:0%
centers and they see a pa
 
00:49:23.599 --> 00:49:24.950 align:start position:0%
centers and they see a pa
um

00:49:24.950 --> 00:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:25.990 align:start position:0%
um
then

00:49:25.990 --> 00:49:26.000 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:49:28.870 --> 00:49:28.880 align:start position:0%
but but the the physician who is the the
 
00:49:31.270 --> 00:49:31.280 align:start position:0%
responsible supervising physician or in
 
00:49:33.430 --> 00:49:33.440 align:start position:0%
this case the collaborating physician of
 
00:49:35.109 --> 00:49:35.119 align:start position:0%
this bill they have nothing to do with
 
00:49:37.910 --> 00:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
the care under the scenario i um painted
 
00:49:40.230 --> 00:49:40.240 align:start position:0%
for representative fellows
 
00:49:41.829 --> 00:49:41.839 align:start position:0%
they would not that physician would not
 
00:49:44.870 --> 00:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
be sued but i'm sure that the elliot as
 
00:49:47.430 --> 00:49:47.440 align:start position:0%
the employer of the pa
 
00:49:49.589 --> 00:49:49.599 align:start position:0%
would be um would be part of the lawsuit
 
00:49:51.270 --> 00:49:51.280 align:start position:0%
that's that's just
 
00:49:52.710 --> 00:49:52.720 align:start position:0%
speculation i think we're all
 
00:49:55.430 --> 00:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
speculating a lot about lawsuits
 
00:49:57.190 --> 00:49:57.200 align:start position:0%
so i would
 
00:49:59.829 --> 00:49:59.839 align:start position:0%
yes representative o'brien thank you
 
00:50:02.069 --> 00:50:02.079 align:start position:0%
madam chair i don't care about lawsuits
 
00:50:02.079 --> 00:50:03.829 align:start position:0%
madam chair i don't care about lawsuits
but

00:50:03.829 --> 00:50:03.839 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:50:08.069 --> 00:50:08.079 align:start position:0%
what i hear here from your explanation
 
00:50:10.470 --> 00:50:10.480 align:start position:0%
you know as a deputy my former job as a
 
00:50:12.150 --> 00:50:12.160 align:start position:0%
deputy fire chief i used to read the
 
00:50:13.910 --> 00:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
reports and just to make sure that
 
00:50:15.349 --> 00:50:15.359 align:start position:0%
everything was adequate that the
 
00:50:16.710 --> 00:50:16.720 align:start position:0%
companies were
 
00:50:18.950 --> 00:50:18.960 align:start position:0%
behaving within the training and
 
00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:20.549 align:start position:0%
behaving within the training and
procedures

00:50:20.549 --> 00:50:20.559 align:start position:0%
procedures
 
00:50:22.309 --> 00:50:22.319 align:start position:0%
by eliminating this
 
00:50:22.319 --> 00:50:23.109 align:start position:0%
by eliminating this
uh

00:50:23.109 --> 00:50:23.119 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:50:25.030 --> 00:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
in other words no physicians got to
 
00:50:26.950 --> 00:50:26.960 align:start position:0%
review and say oh i think you might have
 
00:50:29.750 --> 00:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
got this wrong reading the report you
 
00:50:31.910 --> 00:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
should probably call the patient back is
 
00:50:33.990 --> 00:50:34.000 align:start position:0%
is that eliminating that
 
00:50:36.790 --> 00:50:36.800 align:start position:0%
a supervisory look at it a second
 
00:50:41.430 --> 00:50:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:42.390 --> 00:50:42.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:50:45.829 --> 00:50:45.839 align:start position:0%
representative this bill does not change
 
00:50:48.150 --> 00:50:48.160 align:start position:0%
anything in terms of how
 
00:50:49.910 --> 00:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
a physician
 
00:50:53.270 --> 00:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
and a pa interact it doesn't change
 
00:50:57.750 --> 00:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
how a an employer would require a pa in
 
00:51:01.750 --> 00:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:04.150 --> 00:51:04.160 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
00:51:08.790 --> 00:51:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:10.670 --> 00:51:10.680 align:start position:0%
do we have further witnesses
 
00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:12.470 align:start position:0%
do we have further witnesses
[Music]

00:51:12.470 --> 00:51:12.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:13.910 align:start position:0%
[Music]

00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:51:16.230 --> 00:51:16.240 align:start position:0%
we have that's the last pin card we have
 
00:51:18.790 --> 00:51:18.800 align:start position:0%
i'm going to ask
 
00:51:20.549 --> 00:51:20.559 align:start position:0%
i'm going to ask if anyone else wishes
 
00:51:23.109 --> 00:51:23.119 align:start position:0%
to speak but we've already spent
 
00:51:25.670 --> 00:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
more time than anticipated on this so
 
00:51:27.990 --> 00:51:28.000 align:start position:0%
unless you have a serious question
 
00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:30.480 align:start position:0%

would be someone else coming up but i
 
00:51:37.750 --> 00:51:37.760 align:start position:0%
will ask
 
00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:38.549 align:start position:0%
will ask
to

00:51:38.549 --> 00:51:38.559 align:start position:0%

00:51:40.950 --> 00:51:40.960 align:start position:0%
i guess mr cousy
 
00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:42.710 align:start position:0%
i guess mr cousy
um

00:51:42.710 --> 00:51:42.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:45.190 --> 00:51:45.200 align:start position:0%
on here it struck
 
00:51:47.109 --> 00:51:47.119 align:start position:0%
that the individual must maintain
 
00:51:48.710 --> 00:51:48.720 align:start position:0%
current national certification if
 
00:51:51.589 --> 00:51:51.599 align:start position:0%
required by a national certifying body
 
00:51:53.589 --> 00:51:53.599 align:start position:0%
um why was that struck and is that no
 
00:51:55.750 --> 00:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
longer applicable do they not belong to
 
00:51:58.790 --> 00:51:58.800 align:start position:0%
any national certification uh
 
00:52:00.790 --> 00:52:00.800 align:start position:0%
they i i don't have the the bill in
 
00:52:03.109 --> 00:52:03.119 align:start position:0%
front of me but those were what the bill
 
00:52:05.750 --> 00:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
was looking to do was remove entities
 
00:52:09.670 --> 00:52:09.680 align:start position:0%
that or references to certifications uh
 
00:52:12.470 --> 00:52:12.480 align:start position:0%
that do not exist and that would be uh
 
00:52:14.710 --> 00:52:14.720 align:start position:0%
that would be a situation
 
00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:16.150 align:start position:0%
that would be a situation
um

00:52:16.150 --> 00:52:16.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:18.309 --> 00:52:18.319 align:start position:0%
there as um as i heard it as you know as
 
00:52:21.829 --> 00:52:21.839 align:start position:0%
i'm remembering what's in the bill
 
00:52:29.030 --> 00:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:30.790 --> 00:52:30.800 align:start position:0%
on page 2
 
00:52:38.069 --> 00:52:38.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:39.910 --> 00:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
yeah there are no national there is no
 
00:52:42.069 --> 00:52:42.079 align:start position:0%
national certification
 
00:52:44.470 --> 00:52:44.480 align:start position:0%
um that exists and that's why that was
 
00:52:48.950 --> 00:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:51.750 --> 00:52:51.760 align:start position:0%

close look at the emergency orders
 
00:54:43.430 --> 00:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
issued during the pandemic to see which
 
00:54:45.430 --> 00:54:45.440 align:start position:0%
should be codified into law when the
 
00:54:48.390 --> 00:54:48.400 align:start position:0%
state of emergency lapsed the result was
 
00:54:51.430 --> 00:54:51.440 align:start position:0%
senate bill 155 which among other
 
00:54:53.829 --> 00:54:53.839 align:start position:0%
provisions extending the temporary
 
00:54:56.390 --> 00:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
health partners program and gave the
 
00:54:59.349 --> 00:54:59.359 align:start position:0%
office of professional licensure and
 
00:55:01.910 --> 00:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
certification to issue emergency
 
00:55:05.349 --> 00:55:05.359 align:start position:0%
licenses to in-demand medical providers
 
00:55:07.670 --> 00:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
that authority and those licenses should
 
00:55:10.230 --> 00:55:10.240 align:start position:0%
have expired on january 31st
 
00:55:12.630 --> 00:55:12.640 align:start position:0%
but the oplc was able to go through
 
00:55:15.990 --> 00:55:16.000 align:start position:0%
rules for a short-term extension senate
 
00:55:19.430 --> 00:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
bill 277 simply changes the date until
 
00:55:22.390 --> 00:55:22.400 align:start position:0%
which the oplc can issue licenses from
 
00:55:28.230 --> 00:55:28.240 align:start position:0%
january 31st 2022 to january 31st 2024
 
00:55:30.549 --> 00:55:30.559 align:start position:0%
since the beginning of the pandemic 22
 
00:55:33.670 --> 00:55:33.680 align:start position:0%
000 individuals not previously licensed
 
00:55:35.270 --> 00:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire have been granted
 
00:55:38.710 --> 00:55:38.720 align:start position:0%
emergency licensing status this program
 
00:55:41.430 --> 00:55:41.440 align:start position:0%
is working we should extend it two more
 
00:55:44.230 --> 00:55:44.240 align:start position:0%
years and give the next legislature time
 
00:55:46.870 --> 00:55:46.880 align:start position:0%
to consider this streamlined licensing
 
00:55:50.470 --> 00:55:50.480 align:start position:0%
authority should be repealed extended or
 
00:55:52.950 --> 00:55:52.960 align:start position:0%
made permanent we all know how important
 
00:55:54.390 --> 00:55:54.400 align:start position:0%
this has been for the state of new
 
00:55:56.230 --> 00:55:56.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire given how difficult it has
 
00:55:58.150 --> 00:55:58.160 align:start position:0%
been to find health care providers in
 
00:56:00.390 --> 00:56:00.400 align:start position:0%
these times if you have any questions
 
00:56:02.150 --> 00:56:02.160 align:start position:0%
for senator hennessey i can make sure
 
00:56:04.069 --> 00:56:04.079 align:start position:0%
she gets you an answer but i would
 
00:56:06.710 --> 00:56:06.720 align:start position:0%
largely defer to oplc and the health
 
00:56:08.549 --> 00:56:08.559 align:start position:0%
care providers here in support of this
 
00:56:10.390 --> 00:56:10.400 align:start position:0%
bill senator hennessey thank you for
 
00:56:12.710 --> 00:56:12.720 align:start position:0%
your consideration and support of senate
 
00:56:15.670 --> 00:56:15.680 align:start position:0%
bill 277 thank you very much for your
 
00:56:15.680 --> 00:56:17.109 align:start position:0%
bill 277 thank you very much for your
time

00:56:17.109 --> 00:56:17.119 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:56:20.150 --> 00:56:20.160 align:start position:0%
thank you um i believe
 
00:56:21.670 --> 00:56:21.680 align:start position:0%
i don't think we'll have any questions
 
00:56:23.589 --> 00:56:23.599 align:start position:0%
at this point so
 
00:56:25.990 --> 00:56:26.000 align:start position:0%
but we we will reserve the right to uh
 
00:56:27.910 --> 00:56:27.920 align:start position:0%
communicate with you if we do thank you
 
00:56:29.510 --> 00:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
very much madam chair
 
00:56:50.150 --> 00:56:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:51.910 --> 00:56:51.920 align:start position:0%
good morning madam chair my name is kate
 
00:56:53.990 --> 00:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
horgan i serve as the executive director
 
00:56:55.670 --> 00:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
for the new hampshire association of
 
00:56:57.430 --> 00:56:57.440 align:start position:0%
counties which is all of your elected
 
00:57:00.069 --> 00:57:00.079 align:start position:0%
and appointed officials this bill is
 
00:57:03.270 --> 00:57:03.280 align:start position:0%
very simple as peter explained it puts
 
00:57:05.670 --> 00:57:05.680 align:start position:0%
temporary health care licenses into the
 
00:57:08.150 --> 00:57:08.160 align:start position:0%
statute for another two years
 
00:57:10.309 --> 00:57:10.319 align:start position:0%
temporary health care partners
 
00:57:12.710 --> 00:57:12.720 align:start position:0%
in our county nursing homes have been
 
00:57:15.030 --> 00:57:15.040 align:start position:0%
vital as we continue to work through our
 
00:57:17.430 --> 00:57:17.440 align:start position:0%
workforce shortage and we would urge the
 
00:57:18.710 --> 00:57:18.720 align:start position:0%
committee to
 
00:57:20.069 --> 00:57:20.079 align:start position:0%
support the bill
 
00:57:22.950 --> 00:57:22.960 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure oplc will have lots more
 
00:57:25.030 --> 00:57:25.040 align:start position:0%
detailed answers for you but i'm happy
 
00:57:29.829 --> 00:57:29.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:31.589 --> 00:57:31.599 align:start position:0%
which professions are getting these
 
00:57:35.030 --> 00:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
emergency and temporary licenses uh so
 
00:57:35.040 --> 00:57:36.069 align:start position:0%
emergency and temporary licenses uh so
it's

00:57:36.069 --> 00:57:36.079 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:57:38.549 --> 00:57:38.559 align:start position:0%
i'm sure oplc can tell you all of them
 
00:57:40.549 --> 00:57:40.559 align:start position:0%
um so i would direct it to them but i do
 
00:57:41.750 --> 00:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
know that they are working in the
 
00:57:46.870 --> 00:57:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:50.150 --> 00:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:07.510 --> 00:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:08.950 --> 00:58:08.960 align:start position:0%

00:58:25.589 --> 00:58:25.599 align:start position:0%
senate bill 277
 
00:58:27.589 --> 00:58:27.599 align:start position:0%
our executive director lindsay courtney
 
00:58:29.109 --> 00:58:29.119 align:start position:0%

thank you are there are there questions
 
00:58:46.069 --> 00:58:46.079 align:start position:0%

thank you madam chair
 
00:58:50.630 --> 00:58:50.640 align:start position:0%
why why do they feel the need to take it
 
00:58:53.910 --> 00:58:53.920 align:start position:0%
out to 2024
 
00:58:53.920 --> 00:58:55.190 align:start position:0%
out to 2024
um

00:58:55.190 --> 00:58:55.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:56.549 --> 00:58:56.559 align:start position:0%
i'm not
 
00:58:59.190 --> 00:58:59.200 align:start position:0%
exactly certain i could of why it was
 
00:59:01.270 --> 00:59:01.280 align:start position:0%
taken out two years why it was that
 
00:59:03.030 --> 00:59:03.040 align:start position:0%
length of time i can certainly follow up
 
00:59:04.630 --> 00:59:04.640 align:start position:0%
with the executive director and get back
 
00:59:10.069 --> 00:59:10.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:12.470 --> 00:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
thank you it is two years from 2022 to
 
00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:14.950 align:start position:0%
thank you it is two years from 2022 to
2024.

00:59:14.950 --> 00:59:14.960 align:start position:0%
2024.
 
00:59:14.960 --> 00:59:16.390 align:start position:0%
2024.
yes

00:59:16.390 --> 00:59:16.400 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:59:18.390 --> 00:59:18.400 align:start position:0%
yes thank you uh
 
00:59:22.950 --> 00:59:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:24.950 --> 00:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um i just want to
 
00:59:26.870 --> 00:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
make sure i'm not misunderstanding what
 
00:59:28.630 --> 00:59:28.640 align:start position:0%
i'm i expect is actually a simple
 
00:59:29.990 --> 00:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
concept here
 
00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:31.109 align:start position:0%
concept here
um

00:59:31.109 --> 00:59:31.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:33.750 --> 00:59:33.760 align:start position:0%
right now there's a temporary
 
00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:34.710 align:start position:0%
right now there's a temporary
um

00:59:34.710 --> 00:59:34.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:34.720 --> 00:59:36.549 align:start position:0%
um
situation

00:59:36.549 --> 00:59:36.559 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:59:38.630 --> 00:59:38.640 align:start position:0%
that was triggered by the declaration of
 
00:59:40.630 --> 00:59:40.640 align:start position:0%
a state of emergency
 
00:59:43.829 --> 00:59:43.839 align:start position:0%
that arrangement is set to expire
 
00:59:45.750 --> 00:59:45.760 align:start position:0%
and the goal here is to extend it for
 
00:59:48.390 --> 00:59:48.400 align:start position:0%
two years and so my question is since
 
00:59:50.710 --> 00:59:50.720 align:start position:0%
you've answered the first ones with nods
 
00:59:52.710 --> 00:59:52.720 align:start position:0%
the my question is is
 
00:59:55.510 --> 00:59:55.520 align:start position:0%
why not seek to make it permanent now
 
00:59:57.190 --> 00:59:57.200 align:start position:0%
based upon
 
00:59:59.430 --> 00:59:59.440 align:start position:0%
a subsequent declaration of an emergency
 
01:00:02.150 --> 01:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
i'd like a little insight thank you
 
01:00:04.710 --> 01:00:04.720 align:start position:0%
um certainly i can i can attempt to
 
01:00:06.150 --> 01:00:06.160 align:start position:0%
answer that to the best of my ability i
 
01:00:07.670 --> 01:00:07.680 align:start position:0%
may have to follow up on that one as
 
01:00:11.829 --> 01:00:11.839 align:start position:0%
well um but my understanding is that
 
01:00:11.839 --> 01:00:12.950 align:start position:0%
well um but my understanding is that
although

01:00:12.950 --> 01:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
although
 
01:00:15.430 --> 01:00:15.440 align:start position:0%
healthcare workers who had these
 
01:00:17.910 --> 01:00:17.920 align:start position:0%
temporary licenses had the opportunity
 
01:00:19.990 --> 01:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
to seek full licensure many of them did
 
01:00:23.109 --> 01:00:23.119 align:start position:0%
not there is a concern that if
 
01:00:25.510 --> 01:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
those licenses are to expire and are not
 
01:00:28.230 --> 01:00:28.240 align:start position:0%
extended that that would have a negative
 
01:00:30.069 --> 01:00:30.079 align:start position:0%
impact on
 
01:00:31.910 --> 01:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
the workforce in health care in new
 
01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:33.670 align:start position:0%
the workforce in health care in new
hampshire

01:00:33.670 --> 01:00:33.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:00:35.910 --> 01:00:35.920 align:start position:0%
so that may be partially
 
01:00:38.230 --> 01:00:38.240 align:start position:0%
why it was looking look too extended why
 
01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:40.480 align:start position:0%
or look to be extended because they can
 
01:00:42.150 --> 01:00:42.160 align:start position:0%
seek full licensure but many of them
 
01:00:44.230 --> 01:00:44.240 align:start position:0%
have not for various reasons
 
01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:45.349 align:start position:0%
have not for various reasons
um

01:00:45.349 --> 01:00:45.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:46.789 --> 01:00:46.799 align:start position:0%
but again i can follow up with the
 
01:00:48.150 --> 01:00:48.160 align:start position:0%
executive director to get a more
 
01:00:49.829 --> 01:00:49.839 align:start position:0%
detailed response to you
 
01:00:53.270 --> 01:00:53.280 align:start position:0%
on that that's what concerns me is
 
01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:54.309 align:start position:0%
on that that's what concerns me is
that

01:00:54.309 --> 01:00:54.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:00:56.630 --> 01:00:56.640 align:start position:0%
we had a separate bill to
 
01:00:59.270 --> 01:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
consider the qualifications of people
 
01:01:01.349 --> 01:01:01.359 align:start position:0%
who are getting these license
 
01:01:03.670 --> 01:01:03.680 align:start position:0%
and i'm very concerned that there are
 
01:01:06.390 --> 01:01:06.400 align:start position:0%
people who are actually
 
01:01:08.549 --> 01:01:08.559 align:start position:0%
not applying for a permanent license
 
01:01:10.789 --> 01:01:10.799 align:start position:0%
because they wouldn't qualify
 
01:01:13.510 --> 01:01:13.520 align:start position:0%
and i don't know
 
01:01:15.349 --> 01:01:15.359 align:start position:0%
if we want to do that
 
01:01:17.430 --> 01:01:17.440 align:start position:0%
also i'm very concerned that you're
 
01:01:19.270 --> 01:01:19.280 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
01:01:21.190 --> 01:01:21.200 align:start position:0%
online eight you're
 
01:01:24.390 --> 01:01:24.400 align:start position:0%
you're applying this retroactively
 
01:01:26.150 --> 01:01:26.160 align:start position:0%
and i don't believe that's
 
01:01:31.349 --> 01:01:31.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:31.359 --> 01:01:35.990 align:start position:0%
 
right

01:01:35.990 --> 01:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:37.430 --> 01:01:37.440 align:start position:0%

01:01:40.549 --> 01:01:40.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:42.549 --> 01:01:42.559 align:start position:0%
thank you ma'am chair
 
01:01:47.990 --> 01:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:50.950 --> 01:01:50.960 align:start position:0%
the first page on line
 
01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:58.549 --> 01:01:58.559 align:start position:0%
not charging a fee for a male and
 
01:02:09.270 --> 01:02:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:10.789 --> 01:02:10.799 align:start position:0%
i apologize i'm going to have to follow
 
01:02:13.109 --> 01:02:13.119 align:start position:0%
up on that as well um i i don't know why
 
01:02:15.589 --> 01:02:15.599 align:start position:0%
there's no cost it may have
 
01:02:17.190 --> 01:02:17.200 align:start position:0%
simply been part of the emergency
 
01:02:19.430 --> 01:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
process to get it in place quickly
 
01:02:21.029 --> 01:02:21.039 align:start position:0%
that would be extended but i will follow
 
01:02:23.029 --> 01:02:23.039 align:start position:0%
up and get you a better answer on that
 
01:02:23.910 --> 01:02:23.920 align:start position:0%
thank you because if we're going to
 
01:02:25.430 --> 01:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
extend this for almost two years i think
 
01:02:27.190 --> 01:02:27.200 align:start position:0%
they should be paying
 
01:02:29.029 --> 01:02:29.039 align:start position:0%
i would tend to agree
 
01:02:32.549 --> 01:02:32.559 align:start position:0%
since that's a fairly hefty license fee
 
01:02:34.630 --> 01:02:34.640 align:start position:0%
i take it that none of the individuals
 
01:02:36.950 --> 01:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
who applied for these these licenses
 
01:02:40.069 --> 01:02:40.079 align:start position:0%
paid any kind of a fee
 
01:02:44.710 --> 01:02:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:46.390 --> 01:02:46.400 align:start position:0%
i apologize i don't
 
01:02:53.430 --> 01:02:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:57.029 --> 01:02:57.039 align:start position:0%
yes representative pearson thank you
 
01:03:00.150 --> 01:03:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:02.470 --> 01:03:02.480 align:start position:0%
worked our way through the coba 19
 
01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:05.109 align:start position:0%
worked our way through the coba 19
pandemic

01:03:05.109 --> 01:03:05.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:07.349 --> 01:03:07.359 align:start position:0%
and as we've discussed both in this
 
01:03:11.750 --> 01:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:13.990 --> 01:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
we have
 
01:03:16.150 --> 01:03:16.160 align:start position:0%
different i guess opinions on what
 
01:03:18.710 --> 01:03:18.720 align:start position:0%
constitutes emergency
 
01:03:21.109 --> 01:03:21.119 align:start position:0%
action versus management
 
01:03:21.119 --> 01:03:22.069 align:start position:0%
action versus management
um

01:03:22.069 --> 01:03:22.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:23.589 --> 01:03:23.599 align:start position:0%
i would argue we are well into the
 
01:03:25.670 --> 01:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
management phase
 
01:03:28.549 --> 01:03:28.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:28.559 --> 01:03:31.270 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:03:31.270 --> 01:03:31.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:03:34.710 --> 01:03:34.720 align:start position:0%
from a management standpoint
 
01:03:36.549 --> 01:03:36.559 align:start position:0%
oplc certainly
 
01:03:38.309 --> 01:03:38.319 align:start position:0%
and this is a question i would i would
 
01:03:40.069 --> 01:03:40.079 align:start position:0%
presume has the
 
01:03:41.670 --> 01:03:41.680 align:start position:0%
kind of the management of all this kind
 
01:03:43.029 --> 01:03:43.039 align:start position:0%
of down pat
 
01:03:45.270 --> 01:03:45.280 align:start position:0%
by now
 
01:03:46.630 --> 01:03:46.640 align:start position:0%
um are you referring to the
 
01:03:48.470 --> 01:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
administrative processes involved in
 
01:03:50.150 --> 01:03:50.160 align:start position:0%
issuing i'm referring to the
 
01:03:52.470 --> 01:03:52.480 align:start position:0%
administrative processes of these
 
01:03:54.710 --> 01:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
emergency provisions that were put into
 
01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:55.750 align:start position:0%
emergency provisions that were put into
place

01:03:55.750 --> 01:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:03:58.390 --> 01:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
during the emergency phase of the covet
 
01:04:01.430 --> 01:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
19 pandemic so
 
01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:02.230 align:start position:0%
19 pandemic so
yes

01:04:02.230 --> 01:04:02.240 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:04:04.390 --> 01:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
so you've kind of got this down
 
01:04:06.150 --> 01:04:06.160 align:start position:0%
you're chugging along in other words
 
01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:13.190 align:start position:0%
you're chugging along in other words
okay

01:04:13.190 --> 01:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:18.710 --> 01:04:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:21.349 --> 01:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so uh uh you
 
01:04:23.589 --> 01:04:23.599 align:start position:0%
you've been put into somewhat
 
01:04:25.910 --> 01:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
uh difficult situation here
 
01:04:28.630 --> 01:04:28.640 align:start position:0%
testifying on behalf of uh
 
01:04:33.109 --> 01:04:33.119 align:start position:0%
oplc uh is this uh bill going to have
 
01:04:34.710 --> 01:04:34.720 align:start position:0%
some kind of a subcommittee so that we
 
01:04:35.990 --> 01:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
can have
 
01:04:37.589 --> 01:04:37.599 align:start position:0%
sorry uh
 
01:04:39.430 --> 01:04:39.440 align:start position:0%
see you from where i'm sitting so that
 
01:04:40.390 --> 01:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
we can have
 
01:04:43.270 --> 01:04:43.280 align:start position:0%
access to the executive director who has
 
01:04:45.190 --> 01:04:45.200 align:start position:0%
the authority in this matter and
 
01:04:46.789 --> 01:04:46.799 align:start position:0%
probably uh
 
01:04:46.799 --> 01:04:47.829 align:start position:0%
probably uh
uh

01:04:47.829 --> 01:04:47.839 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:04:51.349 --> 01:04:51.359 align:start position:0%
uh ought to be testifying before us
 
01:04:51.359 --> 01:04:53.029 align:start position:0%
uh ought to be testifying before us
uh

01:04:53.029 --> 01:04:53.039 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:04:55.109 --> 01:04:55.119 align:start position:0%
i don't know it certainly appears to be
 
01:04:57.349 --> 01:04:57.359 align:start position:0%
much less straightforward than i thought
 
01:05:00.470 --> 01:05:00.480 align:start position:0%
when i first read the bill
 
01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:01.589 align:start position:0%
when i first read the bill
and

01:05:01.589 --> 01:05:01.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:05:03.190 --> 01:05:03.200 align:start position:0%
i think it's pretty straightforward in
 
01:05:05.670 --> 01:05:05.680 align:start position:0%
one respect but probably not going to
 
01:05:07.829 --> 01:05:07.839 align:start position:0%
meet with much approval on the part of
 
01:05:10.150 --> 01:05:10.160 align:start position:0%
the committee uh given the fact that
 
01:05:11.829 --> 01:05:11.839 align:start position:0%
there are questions that have already
 
01:05:15.670 --> 01:05:15.680 align:start position:0%
been raised uh that need answers and
 
01:05:17.750 --> 01:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
scholar pelegis is not in a position to
 
01:05:20.230 --> 01:05:20.240 align:start position:0%
provide those answers yes good point
 
01:05:22.710 --> 01:05:22.720 align:start position:0%
representative goalie thank you madam
 
01:05:24.390 --> 01:05:24.400 align:start position:0%
chair and i just want to state my
 
01:05:26.950 --> 01:05:26.960 align:start position:0%
concern as well um especially in if you
 
01:05:28.950 --> 01:05:28.960 align:start position:0%
look at the numbers and the fiscal note
 
01:05:32.069 --> 01:05:32.079 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2022 a loss of almost 700
 
01:05:36.870 --> 01:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
000 in license revenue is a concern
 
01:05:39.589 --> 01:05:39.599 align:start position:0%
yes i mean i i would suggest that some
 
01:05:41.190 --> 01:05:41.200 align:start position:0%
of the people that did not apply to
 
01:05:43.190 --> 01:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
permanent license looked at the license
 
01:05:44.630 --> 01:05:44.640 align:start position:0%
fee and said
 
01:05:48.549 --> 01:05:48.559 align:start position:0%
why bother i can get a free license
 
01:05:51.270 --> 01:05:51.280 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:05:53.589 --> 01:05:53.599 align:start position:0%
that's it
 
01:05:55.349 --> 01:05:55.359 align:start position:0%
i suppose fourth yes exactly
 
01:05:57.349 --> 01:05:57.359 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
01:05:59.829 --> 01:05:59.839 align:start position:0%
um i i don't know if you know the answer
 
01:06:02.069 --> 01:06:02.079 align:start position:0%
to this or not i'm just wondering if the
 
01:06:05.589 --> 01:06:05.599 align:start position:0%
license for the pharmacies that's being
 
01:06:05.599 --> 01:06:07.029 align:start position:0%
license for the pharmacies that's being
extended

01:06:07.029 --> 01:06:07.039 align:start position:0%
extended
 
01:06:10.150 --> 01:06:10.160 align:start position:0%
would have um if that has
 
01:06:12.390 --> 01:06:12.400 align:start position:0%
the that emergency licensing has
 
01:06:14.630 --> 01:06:14.640 align:start position:0%
anything to do with the availability of
 
01:06:18.789 --> 01:06:18.799 align:start position:0%
the covered vaccinations vaccines
 
01:06:21.750 --> 01:06:21.760 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that it does not my
 
01:06:24.150 --> 01:06:24.160 align:start position:0%
understanding of the
 
01:06:26.470 --> 01:06:26.480 align:start position:0%
the permits for the pharmacies has to do
 
01:06:29.029 --> 01:06:29.039 align:start position:0%
with clinical trial participants who
 
01:06:31.990 --> 01:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
would get the clinical trial drugs from
 
01:06:33.750 --> 01:06:33.760 align:start position:0%
a location in massachusetts that would
 
01:06:35.750 --> 01:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
be an out of state pharmacy but they're
 
01:06:37.670 --> 01:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
unable to travel there so it would allow
 
01:06:38.870 --> 01:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
them to
 
01:06:41.589 --> 01:06:41.599 align:start position:0%
still have access to those
 
01:06:42.710 --> 01:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
those drugs
 
01:06:45.270 --> 01:06:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:46.710 --> 01:06:46.720 align:start position:0%
thank you i think representative

yakubovic
 
01:06:49.910 --> 01:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
your subcommittee should at least meet
 
01:06:52.150 --> 01:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
and discuss this possibly with some of
 
01:06:55.430 --> 01:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
the when we get the questions answered
 
01:06:58.390 --> 01:06:58.400 align:start position:0%

01:07:25.270 --> 01:07:25.280 align:start position:0%
look at it you should have it and it
 
01:07:27.349 --> 01:07:27.359 align:start position:0%
tells a little bit about the
 
01:07:28.870 --> 01:07:28.880 align:start position:0%

much has changed since 2002 including
 
01:17:45.270 --> 01:17:45.280 align:start position:0%
the statues in most states new hampshire
 
01:17:48.149 --> 01:17:48.159 align:start position:0%
is the only one of three states that do
 
01:17:51.270 --> 01:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
not allow treatment for all glaucomas by

not allow treatment for all glaucomas by

optometrists
 
01:17:56.630 --> 01:17:56.640 align:start position:0%
senate bill 284 will amend the statute
 
01:17:59.110 --> 01:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
to allow optometrists who are certified
 
01:18:00.870 --> 01:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
by the state board to treat all

glaucomas
 
01:18:04.550 --> 01:18:04.560 align:start position:0%
this has the benefit to patients who no
 
01:18:06.550 --> 01:18:06.560 align:start position:0%
longer will need a referral with
 
01:18:08.470 --> 01:18:08.480 align:start position:0%
separate health care professional to
 
01:18:10.390 --> 01:18:10.400 align:start position:0%
treatment of a disease that the

treating
 
01:18:16.550 --> 01:18:16.560 align:start position:0%
it will also ensure that top-notch
 
01:18:18.229 --> 01:18:18.239 align:start position:0%
optometrists will practice in new
 
01:18:20.310 --> 01:18:20.320 align:start position:0%
hampshire rather than another state
 
01:18:22.229 --> 01:18:22.239 align:start position:0%
where they may practice to the fullest
 
01:18:24.830 --> 01:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
extent of the education and
 
01:18:27.750 --> 01:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
training this bill makes two other
 
01:18:30.709 --> 01:18:30.719 align:start position:0%
related changes to the glaucoma statute
 
01:18:33.110 --> 01:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
that the optometrist here will provide
 
01:18:35.669 --> 01:18:35.679 align:start position:0%
details on
 
01:18:38.149 --> 01:18:38.159 align:start position:0%
i know optometrists today are educated
 
01:18:40.550 --> 01:18:40.560 align:start position:0%
well-trained and capable of treating new
 
01:18:43.350 --> 01:18:43.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire patients as this bill allows
 
01:18:45.430 --> 01:18:45.440 align:start position:0%
and i ask the committee to recommend
 
01:18:48.149 --> 01:18:48.159 align:start position:0%
ought to pass on this common sense
 
01:18:51.990 --> 01:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:53.510 --> 01:18:53.520 align:start position:0%

new hampshire eye associates
 
01:19:49.830 --> 01:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
i started my career in rhode island in
 
01:19:52.149 --> 01:19:52.159 align:start position:0%
2010 and then moved to my dream state
 
01:19:52.159 --> 01:19:53.430 align:start position:0%
2010 and then moved to my dream state
colorado

01:19:53.430 --> 01:19:53.440 align:start position:0%
colorado
 
01:19:55.270 --> 01:19:55.280 align:start position:0%
in 2012.
 
01:19:56.950 --> 01:19:56.960 align:start position:0%
my parents health began to decline in
 
01:20:00.390 --> 01:20:00.400 align:start position:0%
2019 so my priorities changed and i
 
01:20:01.669 --> 01:20:01.679 align:start position:0%
moved back to my home state where i
 
01:20:04.149 --> 01:20:04.159 align:start position:0%
intend to finish out my career it had
 
01:20:05.750 --> 01:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
never crossed my mind that i'd be coming
 
01:20:07.830 --> 01:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
home to a restrictive glaucoma law i
 
01:20:10.470 --> 01:20:10.480 align:start position:0%
fully expected to practice optometry as
 
01:20:13.830 --> 01:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
i had since graduating in 2010.
 
01:20:15.430 --> 01:20:15.440 align:start position:0%
the reason i was so surprised was
 
01:20:17.590 --> 01:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
because after graduation i learned it i
 
01:20:19.669 --> 01:20:19.679 align:start position:0%
landed my first job at a private
 
01:20:20.950 --> 01:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
practice in rhode island and started
 
01:20:23.590 --> 01:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
treating glaucoma without restriction
 
01:20:25.430 --> 01:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
i did not have to clear cases with other
 
01:20:27.990 --> 01:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
providers or have anyone check my work
 
01:20:30.470 --> 01:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
the same was true in colorado
 
01:20:32.790 --> 01:20:32.800 align:start position:0%
i also treated secondary glaucomas in
 
01:20:35.110 --> 01:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
both states from day one
 
01:20:36.390 --> 01:20:36.400 align:start position:0%
in fact new hampshire has the most
 
01:20:38.470 --> 01:20:38.480 align:start position:0%
restrictive glaucoma laws in new england
 
01:20:40.390 --> 01:20:40.400 align:start position:0%
and is one of three states in the
 
01:20:42.229 --> 01:20:42.239 align:start position:0%
country that cannot treat secondary
 
01:20:42.239 --> 01:20:44.229 align:start position:0%
country that cannot treat secondary
glaucomas

01:20:44.229 --> 01:20:44.239 align:start position:0%
glaucomas
 
01:20:45.830 --> 01:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
on top of that i learned that despite
 
01:20:47.510 --> 01:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
having treated full scope glaucoma
 
01:20:49.669 --> 01:20:49.679 align:start position:0%
independently for nine years and
 
01:20:51.510 --> 01:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
studying it extensively in optometry
 
01:20:51.520 --> 01:20:52.629 align:start position:0%
studying it extensively in optometry
school

01:20:52.629 --> 01:20:52.639 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:20:54.149 --> 01:20:54.159 align:start position:0%
i was required to consult with an
 
01:20:56.629 --> 01:20:56.639 align:start position:0%
ophthalmologist for all new glaucoma
 
01:20:58.629 --> 01:20:58.639 align:start position:0%
cases for a full two years after
 
01:21:01.030 --> 01:21:01.040 align:start position:0%
receiving my new hampshire license
 
01:21:02.870 --> 01:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
and since every glaucoma patient was
 
01:21:04.070 --> 01:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
technically new to me the
 
01:21:05.430 --> 01:21:05.440 align:start position:0%
ophthalmologists in my practice were
 
01:21:06.950 --> 01:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
burdened with having to review every
 
01:21:10.390 --> 01:21:10.400 align:start position:0%
single glaucoma patient that i saw
 
01:21:11.990 --> 01:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
this is the same for every doctor moving
 
01:21:14.390 --> 01:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
to this state or new licensee in general
 
01:21:16.310 --> 01:21:16.320 align:start position:0%
since every glaucoma patient is new to
 
01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:17.270 align:start position:0%
since every glaucoma patient is new to
them

01:21:17.270 --> 01:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:21:19.350 --> 01:21:19.360 align:start position:0%
this rule is outdated and is not in line
 
01:21:20.950 --> 01:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
with our modern education and the length
 
01:21:22.550 --> 01:21:22.560 align:start position:0%
of time that optometrists have been
 
01:21:24.950 --> 01:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
treating glaucoma
 
01:21:26.310 --> 01:21:26.320 align:start position:0%
in the state and around the country
 
01:21:28.310 --> 01:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
optometrists have been treating glaucoma
 
01:21:30.229 --> 01:21:30.239 align:start position:0%
for more than 20 years
 
01:21:31.669 --> 01:21:31.679 align:start position:0%
optometrists are doctorate level
 
01:21:33.669 --> 01:21:33.679 align:start position:0%
providers with independent licenses to
 
01:21:35.750 --> 01:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
practice and we do not and we're not
 
01:21:37.189 --> 01:21:37.199 align:start position:0%
required to be monitored or have
 
01:21:40.390 --> 01:21:40.400 align:start position:0%
sign-offs for anything else that we do
 
01:21:42.390 --> 01:21:42.400 align:start position:0%
we have prescriptive authority for oral
 
01:21:44.310 --> 01:21:44.320 align:start position:0%
and topical medications including
 
01:21:47.990 --> 01:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
controlled substances we order mris ct
 
01:21:50.390 --> 01:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
scans ultrasounds stroke workups blood
 
01:21:52.790 --> 01:21:52.800 align:start position:0%
work etc
 
01:21:54.629 --> 01:21:54.639 align:start position:0%
i needed to come home to new hampshire
 
01:21:56.709 --> 01:21:56.719 align:start position:0%
for the sake of my family
 
01:21:58.470 --> 01:21:58.480 align:start position:0%
but a lot of optometrists have a choice
 
01:21:59.830 --> 01:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
of where they want to practice and it
 
01:22:01.350 --> 01:22:01.360 align:start position:0%
makes sense that when choosing a job
 
01:22:02.709 --> 01:22:02.719 align:start position:0%
they will weigh new hampshire's current
 
01:22:05.110 --> 01:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
restrictions versus the ability to treat
 
01:22:05.120 --> 01:22:06.470 align:start position:0%
restrictions versus the ability to treat
glaucoma

01:22:06.470 --> 01:22:06.480 align:start position:0%
glaucoma
 
01:22:08.310 --> 01:22:08.320 align:start position:0%
fully to their level of education and
 
01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:09.510 align:start position:0%
fully to their level of education and
training

01:22:09.510 --> 01:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
training
 
01:22:11.189 --> 01:22:11.199 align:start position:0%
passing this bill will undoubtedly open
 
01:22:12.629 --> 01:22:12.639 align:start position:0%
new hampshire to more candidates for the
 
01:22:14.870 --> 01:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
health care system and more top-notch
 
01:22:18.390 --> 01:22:18.400 align:start position:0%
eye care providers for the community
 
01:22:20.149 --> 01:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
and that is all i have for today but i
 
01:22:21.430 --> 01:22:21.440 align:start position:0%
want to thank you so much for listening
 
01:22:23.830 --> 01:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
to me and for serving our state
 
01:22:25.510 --> 01:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
and i ask that you please support state
 
01:22:27.350 --> 01:22:27.360 align:start position:0%
bill 284 to bring our laws into
 
01:22:29.350 --> 01:22:29.360 align:start position:0%
alignment with our modern training
 
01:22:31.910 --> 01:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
and the rest of the country
 
01:22:33.510 --> 01:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:22:38.950 --> 01:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:42.310 --> 01:22:42.320 align:start position:0%

regards to sb 284
 
01:23:22.790 --> 01:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
being in the north country and in a

care
 
01:23:31.030 --> 01:23:31.040 align:start position:0%
to our communities we treat a myriad of
 
01:23:33.189 --> 01:23:33.199 align:start position:0%
eye conditions and diseases including
 
01:23:33.199 --> 01:23:35.030 align:start position:0%
eye conditions and diseases including
glaucoma

glaucoma
 
01:23:37.590 --> 01:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
but for many years i did not have the
 
01:23:39.270 --> 01:23:39.280 align:start position:0%
authority to treat glaucoma
 
01:23:41.910 --> 01:23:41.920 align:start position:0%
independently because i graduated in
 
01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:43.990 align:start position:0%
independently because i graduated in
2001.

01:23:43.990 --> 01:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
2001.

as you know
 
01:24:02.629 --> 01:24:02.639 align:start position:0%
under the current statute optometrists
 
01:24:05.430 --> 01:24:05.440 align:start position:0%
who graduated prior to 2002 have to go
 
01:24:07.430 --> 01:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
through a tedious and logistically
 
01:24:09.189 --> 01:24:09.199 align:start position:0%
difficult process
 
01:24:11.189 --> 01:24:11.199 align:start position:0%
of obtaining therapeutic glaucoma
 
01:24:11.199 --> 01:24:13.830 align:start position:0%
of obtaining therapeutic glaucoma
certification

01:24:13.830 --> 01:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
certification
 
01:24:17.030 --> 01:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
to clarify the context of my testimony
 
01:24:21.189 --> 01:24:21.199 align:start position:0%
please refer to page 1 lines 24-28
 
01:24:22.790 --> 01:24:22.800 align:start position:0%

01:24:29.750 --> 01:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
as referred in those lines
 
01:24:32.310 --> 01:24:32.320 align:start position:0%
i had to have 25 cases of only one
 
01:24:34.470 --> 01:24:34.480 align:start position:0%
particular type of glaucoma that i had
 
01:24:36.149 --> 01:24:36.159 align:start position:0%
to have my fellow ophthalmologists
 
01:24:38.149 --> 01:24:38.159 align:start position:0%
co-manage with me
 
01:24:39.750 --> 01:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
our patients in the north country would
 
01:24:42.229 --> 01:24:42.239 align:start position:0%
travel one to two hours to meet an
 
01:24:44.870 --> 01:24:44.880 align:start position:0%
ophthalmologist face to face for a set
 
01:24:47.590 --> 01:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
period of time to prove co-management of
 
01:24:49.350 --> 01:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
these cases have been reviewed by the
 
01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:51.510 align:start position:0%
these cases have been reviewed by the
ophthalmologist

01:24:51.510 --> 01:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
ophthalmologist
 
01:24:53.510 --> 01:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
and these cases had to be for only one
 
01:24:55.350 --> 01:24:55.360 align:start position:0%
type of glaucoma
 
01:24:57.750 --> 01:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
primary open-angle glaucoma
 
01:24:59.350 --> 01:24:59.360 align:start position:0%
and as you may know
 
01:25:01.270 --> 01:25:01.280 align:start position:0%
there are many types of glaucoma we have
 
01:25:02.950 --> 01:25:02.960 align:start position:0%
been trained to treat
 
01:25:05.030 --> 01:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
but we could not use the other types of
 
01:25:07.189 --> 01:25:07.199 align:start position:0%
glaucoma in our cases
 
01:25:09.990 --> 01:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
for the certification process
 
01:25:12.070 --> 01:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
this is one of the reasons it took me
 
01:25:14.149 --> 01:25:14.159 align:start position:0%
many years to attain certification
 
01:25:14.159 --> 01:25:15.830 align:start position:0%
many years to attain certification
status

01:25:15.830 --> 01:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
status
 
01:25:18.149 --> 01:25:18.159 align:start position:0%
other reasons were micromanaging
 
01:25:20.390 --> 01:25:20.400 align:start position:0%
ophthalmologists retired
 
01:25:22.709 --> 01:25:22.719 align:start position:0%
and then another one relocated
 
01:25:24.310 --> 01:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
and on occasions
 
01:25:27.189 --> 01:25:27.199 align:start position:0%
patients relocated in which case i had
 
01:25:30.070 --> 01:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
to start over again
 
01:25:32.390 --> 01:25:32.400 align:start position:0%
it was a process that was unnecessary to
 
01:25:33.669 --> 01:25:33.679 align:start position:0%
not just me
 
01:25:36.709 --> 01:25:36.719 align:start position:0%
but to the patients i served
 
01:25:38.550 --> 01:25:38.560 align:start position:0%
because a number of them did not want to
 
01:25:40.390 --> 01:25:40.400 align:start position:0%
see another eye doctor
 
01:25:43.270 --> 01:25:43.280 align:start position:0%
for providing the same care i provided
 
01:25:45.590 --> 01:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
for them
 
01:25:47.750 --> 01:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
i actually contemplated moving to
 
01:25:49.830 --> 01:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
another state in the beginning of this
 
01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:51.189 align:start position:0%
another state in the beginning of this
process

01:25:51.189 --> 01:25:51.199 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:25:54.149 --> 01:25:54.159 align:start position:0%
because if i were practicing in almost
 
01:25:56.310 --> 01:25:56.320 align:start position:0%
all other states of the country
 
01:25:58.149 --> 01:25:58.159 align:start position:0%
i would be able to treat glaucoma
 
01:25:58.159 --> 01:25:59.510 align:start position:0%
i would be able to treat glaucoma
independently

01:25:59.510 --> 01:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
independently
 
01:26:02.310 --> 01:26:02.320 align:start position:0%
regardless of when i graduated
 
01:26:05.030 --> 01:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
as i was academically and clinically
 
01:26:06.830 --> 01:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
trained to
 
01:26:09.750 --> 01:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
do it's ironic to note
 
01:26:11.750 --> 01:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
the associates in my practice who
 
01:26:14.629 --> 01:26:14.639 align:start position:0%
graduated later than i did
 
01:26:16.790 --> 01:26:16.800 align:start position:0%
in 2002 onward
 
01:26:19.510 --> 01:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
with the same education i received
 
01:26:21.430 --> 01:26:21.440 align:start position:0%
were able to independently treat
 
01:26:27.590 --> 01:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:29.510 --> 01:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
needless to say those restrictions
 
01:26:31.750 --> 01:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
impeded not only access to quality of
 
01:26:33.910 --> 01:26:33.920 align:start position:0%
care to our patients
 
01:26:37.669 --> 01:26:37.679 align:start position:0%
but timely quality eye care
 
01:26:39.590 --> 01:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
since i had to co-manage with a
 
01:26:41.750 --> 01:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
sponsoring ophthalmologist
 
01:26:43.350 --> 01:26:43.360 align:start position:0%
and due to the fact there are only a
 
01:26:45.350 --> 01:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
couple of ophthalmologists in our neck
 
01:26:46.550 --> 01:26:46.560 align:start position:0%
of the woods
 
01:26:48.629 --> 01:26:48.639 align:start position:0%
the limited number of ophthalmologists
 
01:26:51.189 --> 01:26:51.199 align:start position:0%
means patients had to wait
 
01:26:52.950 --> 01:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes too long
 
01:26:54.709 --> 01:26:54.719 align:start position:0%
for a co-management
 
01:26:56.950 --> 01:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
appointment with another eye doctor who
 
01:27:00.070 --> 01:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
would be managing these glaucoma cases
 
01:27:02.229 --> 01:27:02.239 align:start position:0%
the exact same way
 
01:27:04.709 --> 01:27:04.719 align:start position:0%
i was managing them
 
01:27:06.950 --> 01:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
these duplicative care scenarios are
 
01:27:10.070 --> 01:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
inefficient to our health care system
 
01:27:12.070 --> 01:27:12.080 align:start position:0%
and more importantly
 
01:27:14.629 --> 01:27:14.639 align:start position:0%
it does a disservice to our patients as
 
01:27:18.149 --> 01:27:18.159 align:start position:0%
we fail to provide a timely access to
 
01:27:18.159 --> 01:27:19.830 align:start position:0%
we fail to provide a timely access to
care

01:27:19.830 --> 01:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
care
 
01:27:21.350 --> 01:27:21.360 align:start position:0%
you may ask
 
01:27:25.750 --> 01:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
how will sb 284 benefit the patients
 
01:27:28.709 --> 01:27:28.719 align:start position:0%
sb284 would take away the burden on our
 
01:27:30.870 --> 01:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
patients and that they will be provided
 
01:27:32.470 --> 01:27:32.480 align:start position:0%
with a timely
 
01:27:34.070 --> 01:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
quality eye care that would be
 
01:27:37.590 --> 01:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
sustainable to our health care system
 
01:27:39.430 --> 01:27:39.440 align:start position:0%
if co-management is needed with an
 
01:27:42.070 --> 01:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
ophthalmologist like in my experience
 
01:27:43.990 --> 01:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
a face-to-face encounter is not
 
01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:45.590 align:start position:0%
a face-to-face encounter is not
mandatory

01:27:45.590 --> 01:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
mandatory
 
01:27:47.830 --> 01:27:47.840 align:start position:0%
this is especially helpful for our rural
 
01:27:50.390 --> 01:27:50.400 align:start position:0%
patients who are not eager to travel
 
01:27:54.110 --> 01:27:54.120 align:start position:0%
hours to get duplicative care
 
01:27:57.590 --> 01:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
sb284 is a patient-centric
 
01:28:00.149 --> 01:28:00.159 align:start position:0%
modernized bill that would ensure we are
 
01:28:03.110 --> 01:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
reaching closer and closer to our goal
 
01:28:04.790 --> 01:28:04.800 align:start position:0%
on preserving the eyesight of our
 
01:28:06.709 --> 01:28:06.719 align:start position:0%
glaucoma patients
 
01:28:08.709 --> 01:28:08.719 align:start position:0%
because there is going to be quality eye
 
01:28:11.430 --> 01:28:11.440 align:start position:0%
care that is easily accessible for the
 
01:28:14.470 --> 01:28:14.480 align:start position:0%
citizens of new hampshire
 
01:28:17.270 --> 01:28:17.280 align:start position:0%
by increasing access to care to highly
 
01:28:20.229 --> 01:28:20.239 align:start position:0%
trained and qualified optometrists
 
01:28:22.550 --> 01:28:22.560 align:start position:0%
patients will be reassured their local
 
01:28:25.110 --> 01:28:25.120 align:start position:0%
eye doctors are ready to provide them
 
01:28:27.350 --> 01:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
with the highest quality eye care they
 
01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:28.550 align:start position:0%
with the highest quality eye care they
deserve

01:28:28.550 --> 01:28:28.560 align:start position:0%
deserve
 
01:28:31.750 --> 01:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
without the burden of long travel and
 
01:28:35.910 --> 01:28:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:38.149 --> 01:28:38.159 align:start position:0%
i thank you for your consideration okay
 
01:28:39.990 --> 01:28:40.000 align:start position:0%
will you answer some questions
 
01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:40.790 align:start position:0%
will you answer some questions
sure

01:28:40.790 --> 01:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:28:44.310 --> 01:28:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:45.990 --> 01:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:28:49.189 --> 01:28:49.199 align:start position:0%
so doctor uh
 
01:28:51.830 --> 01:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
can you tell me or estimate what
 
01:28:53.430 --> 01:28:53.440 align:start position:0%
percentage of
 
01:28:55.830 --> 01:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
i'm over here ma'am to your left oh i'm
 
01:28:55.840 --> 01:28:57.750 align:start position:0%
i'm over here ma'am to your left oh i'm
sorry

01:28:57.750 --> 01:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
01:28:59.430 --> 01:28:59.440 align:start position:0%
right over here
 
01:28:59.440 --> 01:29:00.629 align:start position:0%
right over here
um

01:29:00.629 --> 01:29:00.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:02.149 --> 01:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:29:06.149 --> 01:29:06.159 align:start position:0%
so can you estimate what percentage of
 
01:29:10.070 --> 01:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
the overall patient population that you
 
01:29:13.669 --> 01:29:13.679 align:start position:0%
might have been able to uh to serve
 
01:29:13.679 --> 01:29:14.629 align:start position:0%
might have been able to uh to serve
but

01:29:14.629 --> 01:29:14.639 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:29:16.390 --> 01:29:16.400 align:start position:0%
without restriction had the law
 
01:29:18.870 --> 01:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
permitted it uh
 
01:29:20.870 --> 01:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
what what reduction in
 
01:29:22.229 --> 01:29:22.239 align:start position:0%
uh in
 
01:29:26.229 --> 01:29:26.239 align:start position:0%
uh ability to to provide the totality of
 
01:29:28.550 --> 01:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
service that you should have been able
 
01:29:31.030 --> 01:29:31.040 align:start position:0%
to prevent pres present
 
01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:32.070 align:start position:0%
to prevent pres present
provide

01:29:32.070 --> 01:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
provide
 
01:29:33.669 --> 01:29:33.679 align:start position:0%
um as a
 
01:29:35.590 --> 01:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
against what you actually had to do
 
01:29:37.189 --> 01:29:37.199 align:start position:0%
because you had to
 
01:29:41.030 --> 01:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
get an ophthalmologist involved
 
01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:42.229 align:start position:0%
get an ophthalmologist involved
and

01:29:42.229 --> 01:29:42.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:29:44.390 --> 01:29:44.400 align:start position:0%
reschedule and go through the whole
 
01:29:46.470 --> 01:29:46.480 align:start position:0%
other rigmarole you described in your
 
01:29:49.110 --> 01:29:49.120 align:start position:0%
written testimony i hope you you've
 
01:29:51.270 --> 01:29:51.280 align:start position:0%
already provided it thank you can you so
 
01:29:53.990 --> 01:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
you can you give us an estimate of what
 
01:29:56.950 --> 01:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
kind of loss to your pr to your practice
 
01:29:59.830 --> 01:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
you experience as a result of the
 
01:30:01.510 --> 01:30:01.520 align:start position:0%
current situation
 
01:30:02.950 --> 01:30:02.960 align:start position:0%
that still exists
 
01:30:05.110 --> 01:30:05.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
01:30:05.120 --> 01:30:06.629 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
um

01:30:06.629 --> 01:30:06.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:09.669 --> 01:30:09.679 align:start position:0%
what i see is it's not a loss to our
 
01:30:09.679 --> 01:30:11.270 align:start position:0%
what i see is it's not a loss to our
practice

01:30:11.270 --> 01:30:11.280 align:start position:0%
practice
 
01:30:12.950 --> 01:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
it's more
 
01:30:16.149 --> 01:30:16.159 align:start position:0%
a loss to the patient's um
 
01:30:18.070 --> 01:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
wait time and the care that they could
 
01:30:19.189 --> 01:30:19.199 align:start position:0%
have gotten
 
01:30:21.910 --> 01:30:21.920 align:start position:0%
you know had they gotten access to care
 
01:30:24.470 --> 01:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
right now the wait time to see a fellow
 
01:30:26.870 --> 01:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
ophthalmologist for co-management is
 
01:30:27.990 --> 01:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
more than
 
01:30:29.910 --> 01:30:29.920 align:start position:0%
you know it could be more than six
 
01:30:32.629 --> 01:30:32.639 align:start position:0%
months in some cases in dartmouth
 
01:30:34.470 --> 01:30:34.480 align:start position:0%
and around our neck of the woods there's
 
01:30:36.709 --> 01:30:36.719 align:start position:0%
you know only a couple ophthalmologists
 
01:30:39.350 --> 01:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
i could um access that kind of
 
01:30:41.910 --> 01:30:41.920 align:start position:0%
co-management with
 
01:30:41.920 --> 01:30:46.830 align:start position:0%
co-management with
thank

01:30:46.830 --> 01:30:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:49.590 --> 01:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
you thank you madam chair uh thank you
 
01:30:53.990 --> 01:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
dr k could you just briefly give us um
 
01:30:56.709 --> 01:30:56.719 align:start position:0%
an idea of the
 
01:30:59.110 --> 01:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
timeliness that's necessary to do
 
01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:00.550 align:start position:0%
timeliness that's necessary to do
treatments

01:31:00.550 --> 01:31:00.560 align:start position:0%
treatments
 
01:31:02.629 --> 01:31:02.639 align:start position:0%
such as you're talking about
 
01:31:05.510 --> 01:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
sure i would i'd like to uh answer that
 
01:31:06.870 --> 01:31:06.880 align:start position:0%
question um
 
01:31:06.880 --> 01:31:08.390 align:start position:0%
question um
so

01:31:08.390 --> 01:31:08.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:31:11.189 --> 01:31:11.199 align:start position:0%
the the kind of glaucoma that we see are
 
01:31:15.110 --> 01:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
a myriad of glaucomas you know there are
 
01:31:17.750 --> 01:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
some types of glaucoma that require
 
01:31:19.590 --> 01:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
urgent treatment
 
01:31:21.910 --> 01:31:21.920 align:start position:0%
you know we cannot wait six months
 
01:31:23.910 --> 01:31:23.920 align:start position:0%
depending on the stage of glaucoma that
 
01:31:26.790 --> 01:31:26.800 align:start position:0%
a patient may encounter
 
01:31:29.669 --> 01:31:29.679 align:start position:0%
and so every case is different
 
01:31:29.679 --> 01:31:30.390 align:start position:0%
and so every case is different
but

01:31:30.390 --> 01:31:30.400 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:31:32.790 --> 01:31:32.800 align:start position:0%
you know we always want to think about
 
01:31:35.030 --> 01:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
preserving people's vision and their
 
01:31:37.830 --> 01:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
eyesight and the you know the timelier
 
01:31:40.070 --> 01:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
care they can get and
 
01:31:41.990 --> 01:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
you know in the care that days are
 
01:31:45.189 --> 01:31:45.199 align:start position:0%
they deserve the better and you know if
 
01:31:47.189 --> 01:31:47.199 align:start position:0%
just think of it as if it were your
 
01:31:49.669 --> 01:31:49.679 align:start position:0%
mother or your sister
 
01:31:51.830 --> 01:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
and you know they had just been
 
01:31:54.149 --> 01:31:54.159 align:start position:0%
diagnosed with glaucoma
 
01:31:57.910 --> 01:31:57.920 align:start position:0%
and you can't at this point manage it
 
01:32:00.310 --> 01:32:00.320 align:start position:0%
without them seeing anybody
 
01:32:02.390 --> 01:32:02.400 align:start position:0%
you know it may not be
 
01:32:06.149 --> 01:32:06.159 align:start position:0%
um an emergency situation where you they
 
01:32:07.590 --> 01:32:07.600 align:start position:0%
had to come
 
01:32:10.229 --> 01:32:10.239 align:start position:0%
and get care within a day
 
01:32:12.950 --> 01:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
but in their mind you know they they're
 
01:32:15.830 --> 01:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
already diagnosed for glaucoma and they
 
01:32:18.550 --> 01:32:18.560 align:start position:0%
want that treatment as soon as possible
 
01:32:21.030 --> 01:32:21.040 align:start position:0%
and as i would if i were a patient and i
 
01:32:23.510 --> 01:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
was just diagnosed with a condition that
 
01:32:28.070 --> 01:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:31.669 --> 01:32:31.679 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative scitec um
 
01:32:34.070 --> 01:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
what's the truth what will
 
01:32:36.149 --> 01:32:36.159 align:start position:0%
you're referring someone to an
 
01:32:38.950 --> 01:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
ophthalmologist let's say you are doing
 
01:32:41.110 --> 01:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
glaucoma treatment and the pressures
 
01:32:44.070 --> 01:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
don't go down or if something goes wrong
 
01:32:49.510 --> 01:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:51.910 --> 01:32:51.920 align:start position:0%
it is specified in the bill
 
01:32:54.550 --> 01:32:54.560 align:start position:0%
is there any other questions
 
01:32:56.709 --> 01:32:56.719 align:start position:0%
representative bailey
 
01:32:59.350 --> 01:32:59.360 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um
 
01:33:02.149 --> 01:33:02.159 align:start position:0%
so the part that would allow a 2001
 
01:33:05.110 --> 01:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
graduate or before to proceed is this
 
01:33:07.510 --> 01:33:07.520 align:start position:0%
bolded line that says you're instead
 
01:33:09.350 --> 01:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
certified by the american board of
 
01:33:12.149 --> 01:33:12.159 align:start position:0%
optometry that's what it would allow
 
01:33:14.229 --> 01:33:14.239 align:start position:0%
that's the fix
 
01:33:15.910 --> 01:33:15.920 align:start position:0%
um would you
 
01:33:18.950 --> 01:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
mind clarifying that question line 15 of
 
01:33:20.550 --> 01:33:20.560 align:start position:0%
page one
 
01:33:22.709 --> 01:33:22.719 align:start position:0%
it mentions the 2002. you said you were
 
01:33:24.629 --> 01:33:24.639 align:start position:0%
a 2001 graduate you had all these
 
01:33:24.639 --> 01:33:25.669 align:start position:0%
a 2001 graduate you had all these
problems

01:33:25.669 --> 01:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
problems
 
01:33:28.070 --> 01:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
right see that the jump start for not
 
01:33:30.390 --> 01:33:30.400 align:start position:0%
having that problem is 2002
 
01:33:31.830 --> 01:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
and they've added
 
01:33:33.830 --> 01:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
or who are certified by the american
 
01:33:35.669 --> 01:33:35.679 align:start position:0%
board of optometry
 
01:33:38.470 --> 01:33:38.480 align:start position:0%
that's the fix is it
 
01:33:40.950 --> 01:33:40.960 align:start position:0%
so yes well
 
01:33:44.030 --> 01:33:44.040 align:start position:0%
we now have you know american brought up
 
01:33:45.990 --> 01:33:46.000 align:start position:0%
optometrists who are
 
01:33:49.189 --> 01:33:49.199 align:start position:0%
certified as fellow optometrists
 
01:33:52.390 --> 01:33:52.400 align:start position:0%
and you know having that fellowship
 
01:33:52.400 --> 01:33:54.070 align:start position:0%
and you know having that fellowship
status

01:33:54.070 --> 01:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
status
 
01:33:56.229 --> 01:33:56.239 align:start position:0%
means that they have you know extra
 
01:33:58.870 --> 01:33:58.880 align:start position:0%
continuing education that would allow
 
01:34:02.470 --> 01:34:02.480 align:start position:0%
them to be able to treat glaucoma
 
01:34:06.470 --> 01:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
and and i am one of those optometrists
 
01:34:09.110 --> 01:34:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:11.910 --> 01:34:11.920 align:start position:0%
representative judy and then marsh yes
 
01:34:13.510 --> 01:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:34:16.310 --> 01:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
good morning doctor good morning um
 
01:34:18.070 --> 01:34:18.080 align:start position:0%
right now how you
 
01:34:20.629 --> 01:34:20.639 align:start position:0%
allowed to do surgery
 
01:34:22.310 --> 01:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
no we are not
 
01:34:25.110 --> 01:34:25.120 align:start position:0%
we are not trained for surgery we are
 
01:34:28.870 --> 01:34:28.880 align:start position:0%
primary care optometrists
 
01:34:31.830 --> 01:34:31.840 align:start position:0%
we treat glaucoma medically
 
01:34:34.870 --> 01:34:34.880 align:start position:0%
but we are not surgeons
 
01:34:37.830 --> 01:34:37.840 align:start position:0%
in the you know definition of surgery in
 
01:34:39.990 --> 01:34:40.000 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire statute
 
01:34:41.510 --> 01:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
01:34:41.520 --> 01:34:43.030 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
representative

01:34:43.030 --> 01:34:43.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:34:44.390 --> 01:34:44.400 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair this is a
 
01:34:45.910 --> 01:34:45.920 align:start position:0%
follow-up to the earlier question the
 
01:34:47.750 --> 01:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
certification by the american board of
 
01:34:52.070 --> 01:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
optometry on page 1 lines 15-16 is that
 
01:34:54.310 --> 01:34:54.320 align:start position:0%
certificate time limited or is it given
 
01:34:56.390 --> 01:34:56.400 align:start position:0%
for lifetime
 
01:34:59.750 --> 01:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
the certification process is given to a
 
01:35:01.590 --> 01:35:01.600 align:start position:0%
lifetime however
 
01:35:03.830 --> 01:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
we are obligated to go through a
 
01:35:06.390 --> 01:35:06.400 align:start position:0%
continuing education process you know
 
01:35:08.629 --> 01:35:08.639 align:start position:0%
there are a minimum of hours that we
 
01:35:11.350 --> 01:35:11.360 align:start position:0%
need to attain every year to regain our
 
01:35:13.430 --> 01:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
license sure
 
01:35:15.750 --> 01:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question sir thank
 
01:35:15.760 --> 01:35:17.189 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question sir thank
you

01:35:17.189 --> 01:35:17.199 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:35:18.629 --> 01:35:18.639 align:start position:0%
i have a question
 
01:35:21.430 --> 01:35:21.440 align:start position:0%
um actually it might be
 
01:35:24.870 --> 01:35:24.880 align:start position:0%
applied to the other one it says that
 
01:35:26.870 --> 01:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
it looks as though current statute says
 
01:35:30.149 --> 01:35:30.159 align:start position:0%
the board may waive these requirements
 
01:35:31.590 --> 01:35:31.600 align:start position:0%
for someone who
 
01:35:33.669 --> 01:35:33.679 align:start position:0%
was licensed and practiced for at least
 
01:35:35.270 --> 01:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
a year
 
01:35:38.470 --> 01:35:38.480 align:start position:0%
is the board actually not waiving those
 
01:35:38.480 --> 01:35:42.229 align:start position:0%
is the board actually not waiving those
requirements

01:35:42.229 --> 01:35:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:43.350 --> 01:35:43.360 align:start position:0%
i may
 
01:35:46.070 --> 01:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
answer that question oh please yes
 
01:35:50.629 --> 01:35:50.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:52.390 --> 01:35:52.400 align:start position:0%
okay thank you i wasn't sure who would
 
01:35:54.550 --> 01:35:54.560 align:start position:0%
it would answer it thank you i'll love
 
01:35:57.669 --> 01:35:57.679 align:start position:0%
the postponement any other questions
 
01:35:59.430 --> 01:35:59.440 align:start position:0%
representative pearson thank you madam
 
01:36:00.950 --> 01:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
chair um just curious as to what
 
01:36:03.430 --> 01:36:03.440 align:start position:0%
magically happened in 2002 to put a line
 
01:36:05.109 --> 01:36:05.119 align:start position:0%
in the sand between
 
01:36:05.119 --> 01:36:06.229 align:start position:0%
in the sand between
those

01:36:06.229 --> 01:36:06.239 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:36:08.550 --> 01:36:08.560 align:start position:0%
prior and those after
 
01:36:11.189 --> 01:36:11.199 align:start position:0%
and so that's the year i graduated in
 
01:36:14.550 --> 01:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
2001 and interestingly enough soon after
 
01:36:17.189 --> 01:36:17.199 align:start position:0%
i graduated we had a bill on glaucoma
 
01:36:19.270 --> 01:36:19.280 align:start position:0%
that you know uh
 
01:36:22.550 --> 01:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
gave a scope expansion to optometrist to
 
01:36:24.390 --> 01:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
be able to treat primary
 
01:36:26.550 --> 01:36:26.560 align:start position:0%
angle glaucoma that but that would
 
01:36:29.109 --> 01:36:29.119 align:start position:0%
happen after that year the bill was
 
01:36:29.119 --> 01:36:33.270 align:start position:0%
happen after that year the bill was
passed

01:36:33.270 --> 01:36:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:35.750 --> 01:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
okay that that no that's um that's not
 
01:36:37.350 --> 01:36:37.360 align:start position:0%
really what i asked
 
01:36:40.390 --> 01:36:40.400 align:start position:0%
from a let me rephrase it from a
 
01:36:44.310 --> 01:36:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:46.070 --> 01:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
was there a significant difference in
 
01:36:47.990 --> 01:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
the curriculum
 
01:36:51.189 --> 01:36:51.199 align:start position:0%
that one would go through in 2002 that
 
01:36:51.199 --> 01:36:52.709 align:start position:0%
that one would go through in 2002 that
changed

01:36:52.709 --> 01:36:52.719 align:start position:0%
changed
 
01:36:54.709 --> 01:36:54.719 align:start position:0%
why is this date in here i see i see
 
01:36:56.709 --> 01:36:56.719 align:start position:0%
your question thank you for clarifying
 
01:36:56.719 --> 01:36:57.830 align:start position:0%
your question thank you for clarifying
that

01:36:57.830 --> 01:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:37:00.550 --> 01:37:00.560 align:start position:0%
there is no difference in education uh
 
01:37:01.350 --> 01:37:01.360 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:37:04.070 --> 01:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
someone who graduated in 2001 like
 
01:37:07.510 --> 01:37:07.520 align:start position:0%
myself has the same education as someone
 
01:37:11.270 --> 01:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
who graduated a year later in 2002
 
01:37:13.270 --> 01:37:13.280 align:start position:0%
so it was you know just one of those
 
01:37:15.669 --> 01:37:15.679 align:start position:0%
lines that they made when they
 
01:37:15.679 --> 01:37:16.709 align:start position:0%
lines that they made when they
passed

01:37:16.709 --> 01:37:16.719 align:start position:0%
passed
 
01:37:20.709 --> 01:37:20.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:23.109 --> 01:37:23.119 align:start position:0%
makes no sense to that okay
 
01:37:25.510 --> 01:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
01:37:28.070 --> 01:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much
 
01:37:28.080 --> 01:37:30.070 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much
uh

01:37:30.070 --> 01:37:30.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:37:32.709 --> 01:37:32.719 align:start position:0%

01:37:46.310 --> 01:37:46.320 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you for letting me uh
 
01:37:47.910 --> 01:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
talk to all of you and thank you for
 
01:37:49.830 --> 01:37:49.840 align:start position:0%
your service um through the last couple
 
01:37:51.270 --> 01:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
years which has been more difficult than
 
01:37:52.870 --> 01:37:52.880 align:start position:0%
usual i think
 
01:37:54.950 --> 01:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
can you hear me okay now that's better
 
01:37:57.750 --> 01:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
okay great i appreciate that uh dr
 
01:37:59.510 --> 01:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
dorothy hitch moth i practice in new
 
01:38:00.790 --> 01:38:00.800 align:start position:0%
london new hampshire i've been
 
01:38:03.109 --> 01:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
practicing in the state for over 25
 
01:38:03.119 --> 01:38:04.310 align:start position:0%
practicing in the state for over 25
years

01:38:04.310 --> 01:38:04.320 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:38:05.830 --> 01:38:05.840 align:start position:0%
i'm obviously here representing the new
 
01:38:08.310 --> 01:38:08.320 align:start position:0%
hampshire optometric association i'm
 
01:38:10.149 --> 01:38:10.159 align:start position:0%
also on the board of trustees at the new
 
01:38:12.070 --> 01:38:12.080 align:start position:0%
england college of optometry and can
 
01:38:14.470 --> 01:38:14.480 align:start position:0%
answer any questions about education i
 
01:38:16.470 --> 01:38:16.480 align:start position:0%
was also present for all of the
 
01:38:18.149 --> 01:38:18.159 align:start position:0%
negotiations if you want to call them
 
01:38:20.310 --> 01:38:20.320 align:start position:0%
that when the bill was originally passed
 
01:38:23.510 --> 01:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
both uh in 2002 and prior
 
01:38:25.990 --> 01:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
so i will answer your question hopefully
 
01:38:27.750 --> 01:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
more directly and say
 
01:38:30.870 --> 01:38:30.880 align:start position:0%
that i agree with you it makes no sense
 
01:38:33.109 --> 01:38:33.119 align:start position:0%
um and as all of you know that when
 
01:38:35.510 --> 01:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
legislative compromises occur they often
 
01:38:38.950 --> 01:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
make no sense so um the training
 
01:38:40.950 --> 01:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
of doctors of optometry really hasn't
 
01:38:43.590 --> 01:38:43.600 align:start position:0%
changed since before i graduated which
 
01:38:46.229 --> 01:38:46.239 align:start position:0%
is a lot longer ago
 
01:38:46.239 --> 01:38:47.109 align:start position:0%
is a lot longer ago
and

01:38:47.109 --> 01:38:47.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:38:50.310 --> 01:38:50.320 align:start position:0%
i will affirm that
 
01:38:53.350 --> 01:38:53.360 align:start position:0%
there were many many states already in
 
01:38:56.470 --> 01:38:56.480 align:start position:0%
the country that allowed full scope of
 
01:38:58.310 --> 01:38:58.320 align:start position:0%
practice in regard to the treatment of
 
01:39:00.390 --> 01:39:00.400 align:start position:0%
glaucoma which is a single eye disease
 
01:39:01.830 --> 01:39:01.840 align:start position:0%
by the way
 
01:39:03.830 --> 01:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
happens to be a sight threatening eye
 
01:39:03.840 --> 01:39:05.270 align:start position:0%
happens to be a sight threatening eye
disease

01:39:05.270 --> 01:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
disease
 
01:39:08.310 --> 01:39:08.320 align:start position:0%
so even in 2002
 
01:39:11.189 --> 01:39:11.199 align:start position:0%
so we were already behind the eight ball
 
01:39:13.270 --> 01:39:13.280 align:start position:0%
at that time and i was physically
 
01:39:15.270 --> 01:39:15.280 align:start position:0%
present for all of those negotiations
 
01:39:17.910 --> 01:39:17.920 align:start position:0%
and will tell you that the only way that
 
01:39:20.070 --> 01:39:20.080 align:start position:0%
we were able to compromise and pass the
 
01:39:22.629 --> 01:39:22.639 align:start position:0%
bill at that time was to allow for this
 
01:39:24.390 --> 01:39:24.400 align:start position:0%
secondary process
 
01:39:26.390 --> 01:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
to be implemented and that secondary
 
01:39:28.629 --> 01:39:28.639 align:start position:0%
process is what you're reading in those
 
01:39:30.950 --> 01:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
long two pages in front of you
 
01:39:30.960 --> 01:39:32.550 align:start position:0%
long two pages in front of you
so

01:39:32.550 --> 01:39:32.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:39:35.750 --> 01:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
for those individuals those doctors who
 
01:39:38.709 --> 01:39:38.719 align:start position:0%
had graduated who had not served for a
 
01:39:42.709 --> 01:39:42.719 align:start position:0%
year or did a residency for a year or
 
01:39:44.149 --> 01:39:44.159 align:start position:0%
served in the department of veterans
 
01:39:45.750 --> 01:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
affairs for a year would have to go
 
01:39:47.350 --> 01:39:47.360 align:start position:0%
through another iterative process
 
01:39:49.189 --> 01:39:49.199 align:start position:0%
because there was concern
 
01:39:50.950 --> 01:39:50.960 align:start position:0%
that there were all these doctors
 
01:39:53.189 --> 01:39:53.199 align:start position:0%
running around that somehow didn't have
 
01:39:55.270 --> 01:39:55.280 align:start position:0%
modernized training despite the
 
01:39:57.669 --> 01:39:57.679 align:start position:0%
requirements for ongoing competency and
 
01:40:00.229 --> 01:40:00.239 align:start position:0%
ongoing education through our usual
 
01:40:00.239 --> 01:40:01.669 align:start position:0%
ongoing education through our usual
processes

01:40:01.669 --> 01:40:01.679 align:start position:0%
processes
 
01:40:01.679 --> 01:40:02.629 align:start position:0%
processes
so

01:40:02.629 --> 01:40:02.639 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:40:04.070 --> 01:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
in order to
 
01:40:06.229 --> 01:40:06.239 align:start position:0%
allay the fears potentially of those of
 
01:40:07.990 --> 01:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
you who have to make difficult decisions
 
01:40:09.669 --> 01:40:09.679 align:start position:0%
about scope of practice which is a whole
 
01:40:12.149 --> 01:40:12.159 align:start position:0%
other issue in and of itself that was
 
01:40:14.390 --> 01:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
the compromise with this bill the
 
01:40:16.550 --> 01:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
essence of this bill is to remove some
 
01:40:19.189 --> 01:40:19.199 align:start position:0%
of those old restrictions
 
01:40:21.590 --> 01:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
we are suffering in the north country i
 
01:40:23.510 --> 01:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
will tell you it is very very difficult
 
01:40:25.990 --> 01:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
to recruit doctors we have an access
 
01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:27.270 align:start position:0%
to recruit doctors we have an access
problem

01:40:27.270 --> 01:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:40:29.270 --> 01:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
there are two of us in my area and
 
01:40:31.669 --> 01:40:31.679 align:start position:0%
nobody for a 60 mile radius the dock up
 
01:40:34.149 --> 01:40:34.159 align:start position:0%
the street from me has a one year wait
 
01:40:36.950 --> 01:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
list for just regular eye care
 
01:40:39.669 --> 01:40:39.679 align:start position:0%
i'll be i won't speak on behalf of my
 
01:40:42.470 --> 01:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
friends in ophthalmology but you know i
 
01:40:44.950 --> 01:40:44.960 align:start position:0%
have cataract surgeons that just simply
 
01:40:46.629 --> 01:40:46.639 align:start position:0%
don't have the time to see these
 
01:40:48.870 --> 01:40:48.880 align:start position:0%
patients when that opportunity or when
 
01:40:50.550 --> 01:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
that has to occur
 
01:40:51.990 --> 01:40:52.000 align:start position:0%
you know they're booked out weeks and
 
01:40:54.790 --> 01:40:54.800 align:start position:0%
weeks dartmouth the wait time is months
 
01:40:56.950 --> 01:40:56.960 align:start position:0%
for cataract surgery for example so
 
01:40:59.189 --> 01:40:59.199 align:start position:0%
we're injecting redundancy into the
 
01:40:59.199 --> 01:41:00.550 align:start position:0%
we're injecting redundancy into the
system

01:41:00.550 --> 01:41:00.560 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:41:02.310 --> 01:41:02.320 align:start position:0%
that is just not necessary and that's
 
01:41:04.229 --> 01:41:04.239 align:start position:0%
really what this bill is asking for is
 
01:41:06.870 --> 01:41:06.880 align:start position:0%
to let's please eliminate the redundancy
 
01:41:08.390 --> 01:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
especially in a state where we have so
 
01:41:10.070 --> 01:41:10.080 align:start position:0%
many rural areas
 
01:41:12.790 --> 01:41:12.800 align:start position:0%
with a perfectly qualified and educated
 
01:41:15.109 --> 01:41:15.119 align:start position:0%
group of doctors who have an amazing
 
01:41:17.669 --> 01:41:17.679 align:start position:0%
track record already specifically in
 
01:41:20.229 --> 01:41:20.239 align:start position:0%
this state and amazingly so across the
 
01:41:23.189 --> 01:41:23.199 align:start position:0%
country and treating this one particular
 
01:41:25.030 --> 01:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
disease group i'll tell you there are
 
01:41:27.590 --> 01:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
more types of glaucoma this bill bill
 
01:41:29.590 --> 01:41:29.600 align:start position:0%
specifically addresses what we call
 
01:41:31.990 --> 01:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
secondary glaucomas which means that
 
01:41:35.750 --> 01:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
those cases are somewhat more rare
 
01:41:37.750 --> 01:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
possibly more
 
01:41:40.310 --> 01:41:40.320 align:start position:0%
calcitrant to treatment and may need
 
01:41:42.070 --> 01:41:42.080 align:start position:0%
surgical referral but do we i don't
 
01:41:43.990 --> 01:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
think we need to legislate those types
 
01:41:45.109 --> 01:41:45.119 align:start position:0%
of things
 
01:41:47.109 --> 01:41:47.119 align:start position:0%
these are things that happen naturally
 
01:41:49.350 --> 01:41:49.360 align:start position:0%
between referring providers if you're
 
01:41:49.360 --> 01:41:51.030 align:start position:0%
between referring providers if you're
competent

01:41:51.030 --> 01:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
competent
 
01:41:52.870 --> 01:41:52.880 align:start position:0%
if there's an assumption of incompetence
 
01:41:55.430 --> 01:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
well that's a different problem
 
01:41:57.270 --> 01:41:57.280 align:start position:0%
so i hope i've answered a few of the
 
01:41:59.669 --> 01:41:59.679 align:start position:0%
questions i will also add that i was at
 
01:42:01.510 --> 01:42:01.520 align:start position:0%
the department of veterans affairs for
 
01:42:03.910 --> 01:42:03.920 align:start position:0%
22 years that served the two northern
 
01:42:05.750 --> 01:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
counties in new hampshire
 
01:42:07.750 --> 01:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
and treated full scope
 
01:42:10.229 --> 01:42:10.239 align:start position:0%
many many many veterans who i put on a
 
01:42:10.239 --> 01:42:13.109 align:start position:0%
many many many veterans who i put on a
much

01:42:13.109 --> 01:42:13.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:15.109 --> 01:42:15.119 align:start position:0%
who who i have ultimate respect for and
 
01:42:16.790 --> 01:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
think we need to maintain the integrity
 
01:42:18.390 --> 01:42:18.400 align:start position:0%
of their health care system for a whole
 
01:42:20.470 --> 01:42:20.480 align:start position:0%
host of other reasons but there were no
 
01:42:23.430 --> 01:42:23.440 align:start position:0%
restrictions to this effect um on those
 
01:42:23.440 --> 01:42:24.629 align:start position:0%
restrictions to this effect um on those
veterans

01:42:24.629 --> 01:42:24.639 align:start position:0%
veterans
 
01:42:27.669 --> 01:42:27.679 align:start position:0%
yes thank you my specific question was
 
01:42:30.229 --> 01:42:30.239 align:start position:0%
that it looks as though on page 2 line
 
01:42:30.239 --> 01:42:31.510 align:start position:0%
that it looks as though on page 2 line
15

01:42:31.510 --> 01:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
15
 
01:42:33.830 --> 01:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
it says that the committee may waiver
 
01:42:35.830 --> 01:42:35.840 align:start position:0%
reduce these requirements
 
01:42:37.590 --> 01:42:37.600 align:start position:0%
for people
 
01:42:39.510 --> 01:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
who have a license and proof of practice
 
01:42:41.910 --> 01:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
for 12 months in another state in
 
01:42:43.910 --> 01:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
another set but dr larander said that
 
01:42:46.709 --> 01:42:46.719 align:start position:0%
she had practiced nine years in another
 
01:42:48.950 --> 01:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
state and still was not this was not
 
01:42:51.510 --> 01:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
waived so for her it was wave if i'm not
 
01:42:51.520 --> 01:42:54.390 align:start position:0%
waived so for her it was wave if i'm not
mistaken

01:42:54.390 --> 01:42:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:56.229 --> 01:42:56.239 align:start position:0%
yeah so i believe it what so there were
 
01:42:58.470 --> 01:42:58.480 align:start position:0%
a whole host of doctors who met by
 
01:43:01.109 --> 01:43:01.119 align:start position:0%
statute the waiver i was one of them
 
01:43:02.950 --> 01:43:02.960 align:start position:0%
right so i was
 
01:43:04.870 --> 01:43:04.880 align:start position:0%
treating for years and years and so i
 
01:43:06.629 --> 01:43:06.639 align:start position:0%
didn't have to go through this
 
01:43:06.639 --> 01:43:07.590 align:start position:0%
didn't have to go through this
uh

01:43:07.590 --> 01:43:07.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:43:10.390 --> 01:43:10.400 align:start position:0%
process however there's still even for
 
01:43:12.470 --> 01:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
those of us who have had the waivers
 
01:43:14.149 --> 01:43:14.159 align:start position:0%
there's still restrictions in the
 
01:43:15.990 --> 01:43:16.000 align:start position:0%
language that say you need to refer for
 
01:43:18.149 --> 01:43:18.159 align:start position:0%
a certain time period which is onerous
 
01:43:21.030 --> 01:43:21.040 align:start position:0%
and nearly impossible um especially i
 
01:43:22.709 --> 01:43:22.719 align:start position:0%
understand that i just i was just
 
01:43:24.550 --> 01:43:24.560 align:start position:0%
concerned that the
 
01:43:27.350 --> 01:43:27.360 align:start position:0%
certification committee or credentialing
 
01:43:29.189 --> 01:43:29.199 align:start position:0%
committee was
 
01:43:32.149 --> 01:43:32.159 align:start position:0%
not accepting out-of-state practice
 
01:43:34.709 --> 01:43:34.719 align:start position:0%
because it says may and in many cases
 
01:43:37.430 --> 01:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
we've had concerns with that sure
 
01:43:42.390 --> 01:43:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:44.390 --> 01:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:43:45.750 --> 01:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
and i uh
 
01:43:48.229 --> 01:43:48.239 align:start position:0%
i greatly appreciate you coming
 
01:43:49.830 --> 01:43:49.840 align:start position:0%
before us with your especially with your
 
01:43:53.750 --> 01:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
historical perspective on how we got to
 
01:43:56.470 --> 01:43:56.480 align:start position:0%
this um
 
01:43:58.709 --> 01:43:58.719 align:start position:0%
does this i two two things are you
 
01:43:59.910 --> 01:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
confident that this is going to
 
01:44:03.350 --> 01:44:03.360 align:start position:0%
accomplish what it's intended to do
 
01:44:05.189 --> 01:44:05.199 align:start position:0%
first off
 
01:44:07.109 --> 01:44:07.119 align:start position:0%
yes this will expand the number of
 
01:44:08.790 --> 01:44:08.800 align:start position:0%
doctors that we have that will not have
 
01:44:10.550 --> 01:44:10.560 align:start position:0%
to refer based on the way the language
 
01:44:12.070 --> 01:44:12.080 align:start position:0%
is written right now do i think that
 
01:44:13.590 --> 01:44:13.600 align:start position:0%
there are some other unintended
 
01:44:15.189 --> 01:44:15.199 align:start position:0%
consequences no
 
01:44:18.310 --> 01:44:18.320 align:start position:0%
okay and secondly is there a simpler way
 
01:44:20.310 --> 01:44:20.320 align:start position:0%
to do this or is this kind of just the
 
01:44:22.550 --> 01:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
way you got to pave this road
 
01:44:24.149 --> 01:44:24.159 align:start position:0%
i think this is the way that we have to
 
01:44:26.950 --> 01:44:26.960 align:start position:0%
pave this road this road we one thing
 
01:44:28.390 --> 01:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
that we didn't want to do as an
 
01:44:28.400 --> 01:44:29.750 align:start position:0%
that we didn't want to do as an
association

01:44:29.750 --> 01:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
association
 
01:44:31.270 --> 01:44:31.280 align:start position:0%
is go back
 
01:44:31.280 --> 01:44:32.149 align:start position:0%
is go back
and

01:44:32.149 --> 01:44:32.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:44:33.590 --> 01:44:33.600 align:start position:0%
make it look like we were trying to
 
01:44:35.990 --> 01:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
expand our current scope of practice
 
01:44:38.390 --> 01:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
because as you all know that's
 
01:44:40.870 --> 01:44:40.880 align:start position:0%
a little more difficult pathway so we
 
01:44:43.109 --> 01:44:43.119 align:start position:0%
didn't want to have to sacrifice patient
 
01:44:45.669 --> 01:44:45.679 align:start position:0%
care and access and we thought this was
 
01:44:47.270 --> 01:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
really the most simple way to do it was
 
01:44:48.950 --> 01:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
to just adjust the language as it's
 
01:44:48.960 --> 01:44:50.629 align:start position:0%
to just adjust the language as it's
written

01:44:50.629 --> 01:44:50.639 align:start position:0%
written
 
01:44:52.950 --> 01:44:52.960 align:start position:0%
okay representative schmidt
 
01:44:54.870 --> 01:44:54.880 align:start position:0%
representative pearson has asked my
 
01:44:54.880 --> 01:44:56.229 align:start position:0%
representative pearson has asked my
question

01:44:56.229 --> 01:44:56.239 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:44:58.070 --> 01:44:58.080 align:start position:0%
how efficient are there any other
 
01:44:58.080 --> 01:45:00.470 align:start position:0%
how efficient are there any other
questions

01:45:00.470 --> 01:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:45:02.149 --> 01:45:02.159 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none thank you very
 
01:45:04.870 --> 01:45:04.880 align:start position:0%
much yeah thank you
 
01:45:11.350 --> 01:45:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:13.350 --> 01:45:13.360 align:start position:0%
good morning madam chair members of the
 
01:45:15.990 --> 01:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
committee before i get into my prepared
 
01:45:17.510 --> 01:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
speech i do serve on the joint
 
01:45:19.189 --> 01:45:19.199 align:start position:0%
credentialing committee so i thought
 
01:45:20.950 --> 01:45:20.960 align:start position:0%
maybe i could speak to the waiver
 
01:45:22.870 --> 01:45:22.880 align:start position:0%
situation for a moment
 
01:45:26.229 --> 01:45:26.239 align:start position:0%
regarding dr laranger's practice in a
 
01:45:28.229 --> 01:45:28.239 align:start position:0%
different state that had unrestricted
 
01:45:28.239 --> 01:45:29.510 align:start position:0%
different state that had unrestricted
privileges

01:45:29.510 --> 01:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
privileges
 
01:45:29.520 --> 01:45:30.790 align:start position:0%
privileges
and

01:45:30.790 --> 01:45:30.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:45:32.629 --> 01:45:32.639 align:start position:0%
we are definitely granting waivers
 
01:45:34.790 --> 01:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
however as of now the only thing that we
 
01:45:37.990 --> 01:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
can waiver is the initial certification
 
01:45:42.070 --> 01:45:42.080 align:start position:0%
process of the 25 co-managed cases
 
01:45:45.990 --> 01:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
we are not able to uh do a waiver for
 
01:45:48.470 --> 01:45:48.480 align:start position:0%
the period after certification that
 
01:45:50.629 --> 01:45:50.639 align:start position:0%
every optometrist in the state
 
01:45:54.070 --> 01:45:54.080 align:start position:0%
regardless of year of graduation or
 
01:45:55.830 --> 01:45:55.840 align:start position:0%
regardless of
 
01:45:57.750 --> 01:45:57.760 align:start position:0%
that if they've been practicing for 20
 
01:46:00.550 --> 01:46:00.560 align:start position:0%
years in rhode island we are not
 
01:46:03.270 --> 01:46:03.280 align:start position:0%
able to waive the 24 month requirement
 
01:46:05.510 --> 01:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
where they still have to refer
 
01:46:09.189 --> 01:46:09.199 align:start position:0%
every single new case of glaucoma
 
01:46:11.189 --> 01:46:11.199 align:start position:0%
so it's really a
 
01:46:11.199 --> 01:46:12.870 align:start position:0%
so it's really a
two-tiered

01:46:12.870 --> 01:46:12.880 align:start position:0%
two-tiered
 
01:46:16.149 --> 01:46:16.159 align:start position:0%
approach to how you get your glaucoma
 
01:46:18.790 --> 01:46:18.800 align:start position:0%
certification you do the 25 cases if you
 
01:46:21.669 --> 01:46:21.679 align:start position:0%
were prior to 2002
 
01:46:24.149 --> 01:46:24.159 align:start position:0%
that can be waived if you are practicing
 
01:46:26.870 --> 01:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
elsewhere what cannot be waived again
 
01:46:29.030 --> 01:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
every optometrist once they get that
 
01:46:31.590 --> 01:46:31.600 align:start position:0%
certification has to still co-manage for
 
01:46:33.030 --> 01:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
24 months
 
01:46:35.430 --> 01:46:35.440 align:start position:0%
regardless if they graduated last year
 
01:46:38.229 --> 01:46:38.239 align:start position:0%
from optometry school
 
01:46:41.270 --> 01:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
does that clear that up for you
 
01:46:43.270 --> 01:46:43.280 align:start position:0%
yes thank you very much
 
01:46:47.189 --> 01:46:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:50.709 --> 01:46:50.719 align:start position:0%
lines 22 and 23 are the issues that they
 
01:46:53.109 --> 01:46:53.119 align:start position:0%
that is correct and okay thank you very
 
01:46:55.510 --> 01:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
much thank you
 
01:46:55.520 --> 01:46:56.229 align:start position:0%
much thank you

so
 
01:46:57.990 --> 01:46:58.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to speak
 
01:47:00.070 --> 01:47:00.080 align:start position:0%
to you today in support of senate bill
 
01:47:02.709 --> 01:47:02.719 align:start position:0%
284 this bill seeks to reduce
 
01:47:04.550 --> 01:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
unnecessary restrictions on the
 
01:47:06.390 --> 01:47:06.400 align:start position:0%

current glaucoma statute was passed in

01:47:55.270 --> 01:47:55.280 align:start position:0%
to the statute
 
01:47:57.109 --> 01:47:57.119 align:start position:0%
during my professional career i have
 
01:47:58.870 --> 01:47:58.880 align:start position:0%
treated a large number of patients with
 
01:48:00.950 --> 01:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
glaucoma i know it's been touched upon
 
01:48:02.950 --> 01:48:02.960 align:start position:0%
but glaucoma is a disease in which
 
01:48:05.030 --> 01:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
progressive damage to the optic nerve
 
01:48:07.189 --> 01:48:07.199 align:start position:0%
can result in permanent vision loss
 
01:48:09.750 --> 01:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
about 3 million americans have glaucoma
 
01:48:11.750 --> 01:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
and worldwide it is still the second
 
01:48:14.390 --> 01:48:14.400 align:start position:0%
leading cause of blindness in the world
 
01:48:16.790 --> 01:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
it is very treatable but has no symptoms
 
01:48:19.270 --> 01:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
often so early detection and treatment
 
01:48:20.310 --> 01:48:20.320 align:start position:0%
are critical
 
01:48:22.629 --> 01:48:22.639 align:start position:0%
when glaucoma was added to the optometry
 
01:48:25.270 --> 01:48:25.280 align:start position:0%
statute over 20 years ago treatment was
 
01:48:27.350 --> 01:48:27.360 align:start position:0%
specifically restricted to the single
 
01:48:29.590 --> 01:48:29.600 align:start position:0%
type of glaucoma which we refer to as
 
01:48:32.229 --> 01:48:32.239 align:start position:0%
primary open angle glaucoma it is also
 
01:48:34.950 --> 01:48:34.960 align:start position:0%
the most common primary open angle has
 
01:48:36.950 --> 01:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
no identifiable cause and is
 
01:48:39.030 --> 01:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
characterized by damage to the optic
 
01:48:41.430 --> 01:48:41.440 align:start position:0%
nerve from really many factors but
 
01:48:43.189 --> 01:48:43.199 align:start position:0%
probably the best known as high eye
 
01:48:43.199 --> 01:48:44.149 align:start position:0%
probably the best known as high eye
pressure

01:48:44.149 --> 01:48:44.159 align:start position:0%
pressure
 
01:48:46.070 --> 01:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
however there are many other common
 
01:48:48.390 --> 01:48:48.400 align:start position:0%
types of glaucoma including low pressure
 
01:48:50.870 --> 01:48:50.880 align:start position:0%
glaucoma glaucoma caused by abnormal
 
01:48:53.350 --> 01:48:53.360 align:start position:0%
ocular conditions inocular inflammation
 
01:48:55.350 --> 01:48:55.360 align:start position:0%
glaucoma caused by medication use and
 
01:48:57.830 --> 01:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
glaucoma caused by injury these other
 
01:48:59.430 --> 01:48:59.440 align:start position:0%
forms of glaucoma are within the
 
01:49:01.430 --> 01:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
training and treatment capability of
 
01:49:03.750 --> 01:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
doctors of optometry using the same
 
01:49:05.669 --> 01:49:05.679 align:start position:0%
methods of treatment that we currently
 
01:49:08.790 --> 01:49:08.800 align:start position:0%
use for primary open angle glaucoma
 
01:49:10.709 --> 01:49:10.719 align:start position:0%
for the 13 years that i have been
 
01:49:12.790 --> 01:49:12.800 align:start position:0%
treating glaucoma although i have had
 
01:49:14.950 --> 01:49:14.960 align:start position:0%
the training the ability and the tools
 
01:49:17.030 --> 01:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
to treat these other forms i have been
 
01:49:19.109 --> 01:49:19.119 align:start position:0%
restricted from doing so
 
01:49:22.070 --> 01:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
in these cases i must have my patient
 
01:49:23.669 --> 01:49:23.679 align:start position:0%
receive their treatment from the
 
01:49:26.390 --> 01:49:26.400 align:start position:0%
ophthalmologist this is unnecessary
 
01:49:29.189 --> 01:49:29.199 align:start position:0%
inefficient redundant not cost effective
 
01:49:31.830 --> 01:49:31.840 align:start position:0%
and burdensome burdensome to the patient
 
01:49:33.270 --> 01:49:33.280 align:start position:0%
and to the provider
 
01:49:35.830 --> 01:49:35.840 align:start position:0%
further we have rural areas in our state
 
01:49:37.430 --> 01:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
without sufficient supply of
 
01:49:39.589 --> 01:49:39.599 align:start position:0%
ophthalmologists to treat the conditions
 
01:49:41.830 --> 01:49:41.840 align:start position:0%
a friend of mine dr angel sawyer who
 
01:49:44.070 --> 01:49:44.080 align:start position:0%
practices in north conway reports that
 
01:49:45.830 --> 01:49:45.840 align:start position:0%
due to the lack of other providers in
 
01:49:48.149 --> 01:49:48.159 align:start position:0%
the area or those who would travel to
 
01:49:49.830 --> 01:49:49.840 align:start position:0%
the north country her patients are
 
01:49:51.830 --> 01:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
traveling an hour or two for their care
 
01:49:53.669 --> 01:49:53.679 align:start position:0%
when she is ready willing and able to
 
01:49:55.109 --> 01:49:55.119 align:start position:0%
treat them herself
 
01:49:57.109 --> 01:49:57.119 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the statute is preventing
 
01:49:58.790 --> 01:49:58.800 align:start position:0%
her from doing so
 
01:50:00.550 --> 01:50:00.560 align:start position:0%
these restrictions on the treatment of
 
01:50:03.430 --> 01:50:03.440 align:start position:0%
glaucoma by dr doctors of optometry put
 
01:50:06.149 --> 01:50:06.159 align:start position:0%
in place over 20 years ago are outdated
 
01:50:08.709 --> 01:50:08.719 align:start position:0%
and at this point unnecessary
 
01:50:10.070 --> 01:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
in the past new hampshire was a
 
01:50:12.550 --> 01:50:12.560 align:start position:0%
desirable place for practicing optometry
 
01:50:14.070 --> 01:50:14.080 align:start position:0%
as it was considered to have a pretty
 
01:50:16.470 --> 01:50:16.480 align:start position:0%
good scope of practice however with
 
01:50:19.350 --> 01:50:19.360 align:start position:0%
legislative advantages advances excuse
 
01:50:22.070 --> 01:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
me in other states new hampshire now has
 
01:50:24.550 --> 01:50:24.560 align:start position:0%
one of the most restrictive glaucoma
 
01:50:26.790 --> 01:50:26.800 align:start position:0%
treatment statutes in the country in
 
01:50:28.870 --> 01:50:28.880 align:start position:0%
addition to these restrictions impacting
 
01:50:30.470 --> 01:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
us as eye care providers and our
 
01:50:32.310 --> 01:50:32.320 align:start position:0%
patients the restrictions make it
 
01:50:33.990 --> 01:50:34.000 align:start position:0%
challenging to recruit and hire new
 
01:50:36.149 --> 01:50:36.159 align:start position:0%
doctors to our state prospective
 
01:50:38.390 --> 01:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
candidates are surprised to learn how
 
01:50:39.669 --> 01:50:39.679 align:start position:0%
they would be restricted here in new
 
01:50:41.270 --> 01:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire and some have chosen to
 
01:50:43.109 --> 01:50:43.119 align:start position:0%
practice elsewhere
 
01:50:45.030 --> 01:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
these restrictions limit our ability to
 
01:50:47.750 --> 01:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
add to top-notch providers to our state
 
01:50:49.430 --> 01:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
while i have discussed a good deal of
 
01:50:51.990 --> 01:50:52.000 align:start position:0%
what senate bill 284 will change i'd
 
01:50:53.750 --> 01:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
like to reiterate some of what it does
 
01:50:55.189 --> 01:50:55.199 align:start position:0%
not change
 
01:50:57.189 --> 01:50:57.199 align:start position:0%
there will continue to be requirements
 
01:50:59.430 --> 01:50:59.440 align:start position:0%
for optometrists to consult in advanced
 
01:51:00.790 --> 01:51:00.800 align:start position:0%
cases of glaucoma that are not
 
01:51:03.189 --> 01:51:03.199 align:start position:0%
responding to treatment acute cases of
 
01:51:05.270 --> 01:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
glaucoma that require prompt laser
 
01:51:05.280 --> 01:51:06.709 align:start position:0%
glaucoma that require prompt laser
intervention

01:51:06.709 --> 01:51:06.719 align:start position:0%
intervention
 
01:51:09.109 --> 01:51:09.119 align:start position:0%
or cases of glaucoma in those
 
01:51:11.910 --> 01:51:11.920 align:start position:0%
under the age of 18. it is important to
 
01:51:13.589 --> 01:51:13.599 align:start position:0%
note that we have had detailed
 
01:51:15.669 --> 01:51:15.679 align:start position:0%
discussions with the leadership of new
 
01:51:18.070 --> 01:51:18.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire's ophthalmologists regarding
 
01:51:19.270 --> 01:51:19.280 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:51:21.430 --> 01:51:21.440 align:start position:0%
and what you have before you is language
 
01:51:23.910 --> 01:51:23.920 align:start position:0%
that includes compromises resulting from
 
01:51:26.870 --> 01:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
those discussions senate bill 284 as
 
01:51:28.870 --> 01:51:28.880 align:start position:0%
submitted is language that was agreeable
 
01:51:30.950 --> 01:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
to leadership of both optometry and
 
01:51:30.960 --> 01:51:32.709 align:start position:0%
to leadership of both optometry and
ophthalmology

01:51:32.709 --> 01:51:32.719 align:start position:0%
ophthalmology
 
01:51:35.669 --> 01:51:35.679 align:start position:0%
in summary senate bill 284 will remove
 
01:51:37.350 --> 01:51:37.360 align:start position:0%
unnecessary restrictions on the
 
01:51:39.750 --> 01:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
optometric treatment of glaucoma to the
 
01:51:41.990 --> 01:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
benefit of our patients our colleagues
 
01:51:43.910 --> 01:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
and to the new hampshire health care
 
01:51:45.830 --> 01:51:45.840 align:start position:0%

01:52:46.390 --> 01:52:46.400 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:52:47.910 --> 01:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
point in the 80s
 
01:52:49.750 --> 01:52:49.760 align:start position:0%
that was its own licensure i don't
 
01:52:51.430 --> 01:52:51.440 align:start position:0%
actually know that there are
 
01:52:54.149 --> 01:52:54.159 align:start position:0%
really any optometrists in the state
 
01:52:54.159 --> 01:52:55.589 align:start position:0%
really any optometrists in the state

practicing
 
01:52:58.709 --> 01:52:58.719 align:start position:0%
there are none left
 
01:53:00.310 --> 01:53:00.320 align:start position:0%
follow-up so
 
01:53:02.709 --> 01:53:02.719 align:start position:0%
that would mean we probably could take
 
01:53:05.910 --> 01:53:05.920 align:start position:0%
that out of the statute
 
01:53:05.920 --> 01:53:07.669 align:start position:0%
that out of the statute
um

01:53:07.669 --> 01:53:07.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:09.510 --> 01:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure as our license is still
 
01:53:11.030 --> 01:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
written that way
 
01:53:13.189 --> 01:53:13.199 align:start position:0%

we would have we could look into that

it may not be as simple as changing that
 
01:53:25.589 --> 01:53:25.599 align:start position:0%
paragraph but yes it's something to
 
01:53:28.390 --> 01:53:28.400 align:start position:0%
consider if we work on amendments
 
01:53:29.910 --> 01:53:29.920 align:start position:0%

thank you madam chair
 
01:53:36.870 --> 01:53:36.880 align:start position:0%
why is it taking 20 years to get here
 
01:53:39.109 --> 01:53:39.119 align:start position:0%
that is a very good question
 
01:53:41.669 --> 01:53:41.679 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure i've been practicing for 13
 
01:53:44.950 --> 01:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
years it's certainly been on my radar um
 
01:53:46.870 --> 01:53:46.880 align:start position:0%
the whole time
 
01:53:46.880 --> 01:53:48.950 align:start position:0%
the whole time
but

01:53:48.950 --> 01:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:53:50.950 --> 01:53:50.960 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
01:53:54.470 --> 01:53:54.480 align:start position:0%
some of us now um you know there's no
 
01:53:58.149 --> 01:53:58.159 align:start position:0%
better time than now so here we are yeah
 
01:54:00.550 --> 01:54:00.560 align:start position:0%
yes thank you representative bailey
 
01:54:00.560 --> 01:54:01.270 align:start position:0%
yes thank you representative bailey
hi

01:54:01.270 --> 01:54:01.280 align:start position:0%
hi
 
01:54:02.229 --> 01:54:02.239 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:54:04.629 --> 01:54:04.639 align:start position:0%
going back to that date i mean on line
 
01:54:07.030 --> 01:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
13 page one
 
01:54:09.109 --> 01:54:09.119 align:start position:0%
would the world end if it just said
 
01:54:11.350 --> 01:54:11.360 align:start position:0%
graduated instead of graduated after
 
01:54:13.910 --> 01:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
2002. so i think that was the year that
 
01:54:16.470 --> 01:54:16.480 align:start position:0%
this was passed so i think you know the
 
01:54:18.310 --> 01:54:18.320 align:start position:0%
original statute so i think what they
 
01:54:21.030 --> 01:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
decided was okay from this point on you
 
01:54:22.629 --> 01:54:22.639 align:start position:0%
know this is what we're doing and from
 
01:54:24.310 --> 01:54:24.320 align:start position:0%
this point before
 
01:54:25.910 --> 01:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
this is what we're doing that was 20
 
01:54:28.310 --> 01:54:28.320 align:start position:0%
years ago what would happen if now we
 
01:54:31.350 --> 01:54:31.360 align:start position:0%
just scratched out after 2002
 
01:54:32.229 --> 01:54:32.239 align:start position:0%
would that
 
01:54:34.550 --> 01:54:34.560 align:start position:0%
cause chaos
 
01:54:36.390 --> 01:54:36.400 align:start position:0%
representative bailey will take it as
 
01:54:38.390 --> 01:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
another case where this statute could
 
01:54:39.589 --> 01:54:39.599 align:start position:0%
use some
 
01:54:42.310 --> 01:54:42.320 align:start position:0%
uh fine tooth combing to straighten it
 
01:54:44.790 --> 01:54:44.800 align:start position:0%
up but thank you i i think that is the
 
01:54:46.790 --> 01:54:46.800 align:start position:0%
case representing goalie you have no
 
01:54:49.430 --> 01:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
01:54:55.430 --> 01:54:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:58.310 --> 01:54:58.320 align:start position:0%
the effective date is 60 days after its
 
01:54:58.320 --> 01:54:59.510 align:start position:0%
the effective date is 60 days after its
passage

01:54:59.510 --> 01:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
passage
 
01:55:01.430 --> 01:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh it is frequently the case that there
 
01:55:03.750 --> 01:55:03.760 align:start position:0%
is some preparatory
 
01:55:07.030 --> 01:55:07.040 align:start position:0%
action required of the state or agencies
 
01:55:09.350 --> 01:55:09.360 align:start position:0%
or whatever so they can't put the
 
01:55:12.470 --> 01:55:12.480 align:start position:0%
statute into effect immediately because
 
01:55:14.390 --> 01:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
first you have to have
 
01:55:16.470 --> 01:55:16.480 align:start position:0%
you know step one before you can you
 
01:55:18.149 --> 01:55:18.159 align:start position:0%
have to build a basement before you can
 
01:55:20.629 --> 01:55:20.639 align:start position:0%
build the first floor right
 
01:55:22.550 --> 01:55:22.560 align:start position:0%
is there any reason why we couldn't have
 
01:55:24.390 --> 01:55:24.400 align:start position:0%
an effective date that would be more
 
01:55:27.669 --> 01:55:27.679 align:start position:0%
immediate and relieve our optometrists
 
01:55:30.470 --> 01:55:30.480 align:start position:0%
and our north country
 
01:55:33.229 --> 01:55:33.239 align:start position:0%
population of the
 
01:55:33.239 --> 01:55:35.030 align:start position:0%
population of the
stupidness

01:55:35.030 --> 01:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
stupidness
 
01:55:37.510 --> 01:55:37.520 align:start position:0%
of this current situation
 
01:55:37.520 --> 01:55:38.390 align:start position:0%
of this current situation
uh

01:55:38.390 --> 01:55:38.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:55:40.709 --> 01:55:40.719 align:start position:0%
sooner than 60 days i'm sure we could
 
01:55:43.350 --> 01:55:43.360 align:start position:0%
work on that yes i'm sure if it was
 
01:55:47.030 --> 01:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
agreeable we could reluctant
 
01:55:48.709 --> 01:55:48.719 align:start position:0%
any changes that would make it have to
 
01:55:50.790 --> 01:55:50.800 align:start position:0%
go back to the senate that's it that
 
01:55:52.550 --> 01:55:52.560 align:start position:0%
would be that would
 
01:55:53.589 --> 01:55:53.599 align:start position:0%
the only thing that would make me
 
01:55:55.270 --> 01:55:55.280 align:start position:0%
hesitate and if that was not the case
 
01:55:57.350 --> 01:55:57.360 align:start position:0%
then we could you know certainly
 
01:55:59.109 --> 01:55:59.119 align:start position:0%
consider speeding it up but i'm not sure
 
01:56:02.709 --> 01:56:02.719 align:start position:0%
about the ramifications of of it
 
01:56:05.830 --> 01:56:05.840 align:start position:0%
okay we'll weigh that thank you
 
01:56:08.470 --> 01:56:08.480 align:start position:0%
very good any other questions represent
 
01:56:10.229 --> 01:56:10.239 align:start position:0%
pete you've got representative bailey
 
01:56:11.750 --> 01:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
01:56:13.910 --> 01:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
represent judy yes please thank you
 
01:56:15.910 --> 01:56:15.920 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
01:56:19.030 --> 01:56:19.040 align:start position:0%
good morning doctor thank you uh
 
01:56:20.870 --> 01:56:20.880 align:start position:0%
how many years
 
01:56:24.550 --> 01:56:24.560 align:start position:0%
someone has to study to become
 
01:56:29.350 --> 01:56:29.360 align:start position:0%
an ophthalmologist and also optometrist
 
01:56:31.830 --> 01:56:31.840 align:start position:0%
so for an optometrist we complete four
 
01:56:33.830 --> 01:56:33.840 align:start position:0%
years of undergraduate study graduating
 
01:56:36.470 --> 01:56:36.480 align:start position:0%
with a degree often in pre-med by uh
 
01:56:38.470 --> 01:56:38.480 align:start position:0%
mine was biology
 
01:56:40.629 --> 01:56:40.639 align:start position:0%
and then it's four years of optometry
 
01:56:43.030 --> 01:56:43.040 align:start position:0%
school after that year-round
 
01:56:44.790 --> 01:56:44.800 align:start position:0%
you graduate past the national board
 
01:56:47.589 --> 01:56:47.599 align:start position:0%
exams you may also choose to become a
 
01:56:49.750 --> 01:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
specialist which there's residencies
 
01:56:52.550 --> 01:56:52.560 align:start position:0%
available year or two residencies
 
01:56:55.030 --> 01:56:55.040 align:start position:0%
ophthalmologists go to medical school
 
01:56:56.550 --> 01:56:56.560 align:start position:0%
graduate decide they want to become an
 
01:56:59.109 --> 01:56:59.119 align:start position:0%
ophthalmologist and then they specialize
 
01:57:00.790 --> 01:57:00.800 align:start position:0%
in eye care
 
01:57:02.790 --> 01:57:02.800 align:start position:0%
after that completing a surgical
 
01:57:05.910 --> 01:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
fellowship this bill
 
01:57:08.709 --> 01:57:08.719 align:start position:0%
is not really highlighting
 
01:57:11.910 --> 01:57:11.920 align:start position:0%
those differences are touching um on
 
01:57:11.920 --> 01:57:15.430 align:start position:0%
those differences are touching um on
educational

01:57:15.430 --> 01:57:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:19.830 --> 01:57:19.840 align:start position:0%
requirements or training um however um
 
01:57:20.950 --> 01:57:20.960 align:start position:0%
there is
 
01:57:23.270 --> 01:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
as you appreciate a lot of overlap
 
01:57:25.750 --> 01:57:25.760 align:start position:0%
between the two professions and um this
 
01:57:27.669 --> 01:57:27.679 align:start position:0%
bill has been discussed
 
01:57:29.750 --> 01:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
by both professions and there is no
 
01:57:32.310 --> 01:57:32.320 align:start position:0%
opposition so i think it's a good
 
01:57:34.310 --> 01:57:34.320 align:start position:0%
stepping stone for all of us
 
01:57:36.830 --> 01:57:36.840 align:start position:0%
yes thank you other questions thank
 
01:57:39.430 --> 01:57:39.440 align:start position:0%
you all right
 
01:57:41.910 --> 01:57:41.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you
 
01:57:43.430 --> 01:57:43.440 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to
 
01:57:49.910 --> 01:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:53.750 --> 01:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
represent senator reagan before you
 
01:57:56.390 --> 01:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
dismissed your committee for lunch i did
 
01:57:56.400 --> 01:57:59.189 align:start position:0%
dismissed your committee for lunch i did
something

01:57:59.189 --> 01:57:59.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:59.199 --> 01:58:00.870 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:58:00.870 --> 01:58:00.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:58:02.550 --> 01:58:02.560 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with this bill okay in
 
01:58:04.229 --> 01:58:04.239 align:start position:0%
that case
 
01:58:06.310 --> 01:58:06.320 align:start position:0%
i will close the hearing on senate bill
 
01:58:12.589 --> 01:58:12.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:15.669 --> 01:58:15.679 align:start position:0%
reagan's back and forth with the board
 
01:58:22.550 --> 01:58:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:24.310 --> 01:58:24.320 align:start position:0%
and they promised me that they will
 
01:58:24.320 --> 01:58:25.430 align:start position:0%
and they promised me that they will
draft

01:58:25.430 --> 01:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
draft
 
01:58:28.070 --> 01:58:28.080 align:start position:0%
but through their attorney
 
01:58:31.270 --> 01:58:31.280 align:start position:0%
as a place all about
 
01:58:34.950 --> 01:58:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:37.750 --> 01:58:37.760 align:start position:0%
well our actually center we have
 
01:58:40.070 --> 01:58:40.080 align:start position:0%
a bill that we have an interim study
 
01:58:42.629 --> 01:58:42.639 align:start position:0%
that we were quite far along that we
 
01:58:56.390 --> 01:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:58.070 --> 01:58:58.080 align:start position:0%
we appreciate that
 
01:59:01.350 --> 01:59:01.360 align:start position:0%
okay uh in that case we are breaking for
 
01:59:01.360 --> 01:59:02.470 align:start position:0%
okay uh in that case we are breaking for
lunch

01:59:02.470 --> 01:59:02.480 align:start position:0%
lunch
 
01:59:05.270 --> 01:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
uh senator reagan assures us that
 
01:59:08.950 --> 01:59:08.960 align:start position:0%
uh senate bill 282 is not
 
01:59:10.390 --> 01:59:10.400 align:start position:0%
he's not happy with the current
 
01:59:12.709 --> 01:59:12.719 align:start position:0%
condition and therefore it may not be
 
01:59:12.719 --> 01:59:14.310 align:start position:0%
condition and therefore it may not be
ready

01:59:14.310 --> 01:59:14.320 align:start position:0%
ready
 
01:59:16.470 --> 01:59:16.480 align:start position:0%
for us so if we don't come back on time
 
01:59:19.189 --> 01:59:19.199 align:start position:0%
we'll start late
 
01:59:22.510 --> 01:59:22.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:38.790 --> 01:59:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:38.800 --> 02:03:41.830 align:start position:0%
 
i

02:03:41.830 --> 02:03:41.840 align:start position:0%

03:00:30.880 --> 03:00:31.830 align:start position:0%
all right i will
mention

03:00:31.830 --> 03:00:31.840 align:start position:0%
mention
 
03:00:31.840 --> 03:00:33.990 align:start position:0%
mention
that

03:00:33.990 --> 03:00:34.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:00:36.469 --> 03:00:36.479 align:start position:0%
the intent is for
 
03:00:39.030 --> 03:00:39.040 align:start position:0%
this bill to go to representative leckus
 
03:00:40.630 --> 03:00:40.640 align:start position:0%
and his subcommittee
 
03:00:43.030 --> 03:00:43.040 align:start position:0%
and they will
 
03:00:45.590 --> 03:00:45.600 align:start position:0%
re review it in the context of house
 
03:00:48.469 --> 03:00:48.479 align:start position:0%
bill i think it's 1192 that dealt with
 
03:00:50.070 --> 03:00:50.080 align:start position:0%
the same topic
 
03:00:52.950 --> 03:00:52.960 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:00:56.870 --> 03:00:56.880 align:start position:0%
and fix any issues that may remain
 
03:00:56.880 --> 03:01:00.070 align:start position:0%
and fix any issues that may remain
okay

03:01:00.070 --> 03:01:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:00.080 --> 03:01:01.269 align:start position:0%
 
and

03:01:01.269 --> 03:01:01.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:01:08.309 --> 03:01:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:10.389 --> 03:01:10.399 align:start position:0%
hi i'm elizabeth rob i'm
 
03:01:12.150 --> 03:01:12.160 align:start position:0%
testifying for
 
03:01:16.790 --> 03:01:16.800 align:start position:0%
amending sb 282 hb 1192
 
03:01:18.870 --> 03:01:18.880 align:start position:0%
i was in front of this committee a
 
03:01:20.550 --> 03:01:20.560 align:start position:0%
couple months ago
 
03:01:23.990 --> 03:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
and i submitted about
 
03:01:26.309 --> 03:01:26.319 align:start position:0%
11 or 12 letters from licensed
 
03:01:28.070 --> 03:01:28.080 align:start position:0%
acupuncturists in new hampshire outside
 
03:01:30.309 --> 03:01:30.319 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire
 
03:01:30.319 --> 03:01:31.190 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire
for

03:01:31.190 --> 03:01:31.200 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:01:33.190 --> 03:01:33.200 align:start position:0%
making the following changes to the
 
03:01:35.910 --> 03:01:35.920 align:start position:0%
acupuncture practice act
 
03:01:37.590 --> 03:01:37.600 align:start position:0%
so i just want to point out that the
 
03:01:40.469 --> 03:01:40.479 align:start position:0%
licensing board wants to allow for
 
03:01:42.389 --> 03:01:42.399 align:start position:0%
acupuncturists with a doctorate of
 
03:01:43.910 --> 03:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
oriental medicine to call themselves
 
03:01:46.870 --> 03:01:46.880 align:start position:0%
doctors and that's fine
 
03:01:49.110 --> 03:01:49.120 align:start position:0%
but the changes that we're asking for
 
03:01:52.230 --> 03:01:52.240 align:start position:0%
are allowing equivalent exams
 
03:01:54.469 --> 03:01:54.479 align:start position:0%
like the california exam
 
03:01:57.830 --> 03:01:57.840 align:start position:0%
in addition to the exam issued by
 
03:01:59.830 --> 03:01:59.840 align:start position:0%
the national certification commission of
 
03:02:02.870 --> 03:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
acupuncture and oriental medicine
 
03:02:05.830 --> 03:02:05.840 align:start position:0%
remove the mandate that we have to pay
 
03:02:08.309 --> 03:02:08.319 align:start position:0%
that same organization
 
03:02:10.469 --> 03:02:10.479 align:start position:0%
to maintain active current status in
 
03:02:12.630 --> 03:02:12.640 align:start position:0%
order to keep a license in the state of
 
03:02:13.990 --> 03:02:14.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
03:02:16.710 --> 03:02:16.720 align:start position:0%
it's redundant and burdensome and it's
 
03:02:18.630 --> 03:02:18.640 align:start position:0%
not used in plenty of other states like
 
03:02:21.429 --> 03:02:21.439 align:start position:0%
massachusetts where many
 
03:02:23.510 --> 03:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
acupuncturists come from when they move
 
03:02:24.790 --> 03:02:24.800 align:start position:0%
to new hampshire to get new hampshire
 
03:02:24.800 --> 03:02:27.030 align:start position:0%
to new hampshire to get new hampshire
licenses

03:02:27.030 --> 03:02:27.040 align:start position:0%
licenses
 
03:02:29.429 --> 03:02:29.439 align:start position:0%
most of my co-workers actually
 
03:02:32.230 --> 03:02:32.240 align:start position:0%
and to give the licensing board term
 
03:02:34.870 --> 03:02:34.880 align:start position:0%
limits so in the five years ago there
 
03:02:35.990 --> 03:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
were two members on the board who
 
03:02:37.590 --> 03:02:37.600 align:start position:0%
finally stepped down after serving for
 
03:02:38.710 --> 03:02:38.720 align:start position:0%
20 years
 
03:02:40.630 --> 03:02:40.640 align:start position:0%
it's a lot of gatekeeping
 
03:02:43.110 --> 03:02:43.120 align:start position:0%
um so i'm resubmitting the letters from
 
03:02:43.120 --> 03:02:44.710 align:start position:0%
um so i'm resubmitting the letters from
1192

03:02:44.710 --> 03:02:44.720 align:start position:0%
1192
 
03:02:46.790 --> 03:02:46.800 align:start position:0%
there's a letter from my employer our
 
03:02:48.630 --> 03:02:48.640 align:start position:0%
clinic has been short staffed since we
 
03:02:51.510 --> 03:02:51.520 align:start position:0%
reopened from the pandemic
 
03:02:52.790 --> 03:02:52.800 align:start position:0%
and we've been operating at limited
 
03:02:54.150 --> 03:02:54.160 align:start position:0%
hours and it's hard to find people to
 
03:02:55.590 --> 03:02:55.600 align:start position:0%
come work with us and we have to search
 
03:02:56.790 --> 03:02:56.800 align:start position:0%
out of state because there's not a lot
 
03:02:58.950 --> 03:02:58.960 align:start position:0%
of acupuncturists in new hampshire and
 
03:03:01.030 --> 03:03:01.040 align:start position:0%
so that active current status with the
 
03:03:03.429 --> 03:03:03.439 align:start position:0%
ncc aom is a barrier for people to get
 
03:03:05.429 --> 03:03:05.439 align:start position:0%
new hampshire licenses
 
03:03:07.750 --> 03:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
there's another letter from my long time
 
03:03:10.309 --> 03:03:10.319 align:start position:0%
friend and colleague diana de joya she's
 
03:03:12.630 --> 03:03:12.640 align:start position:0%
a very senior acupuncturist on cape cod
 
03:03:14.870 --> 03:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
running a very successful clinic but as
 
03:03:17.510 --> 03:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
she's getting older she wants to move to
 
03:03:19.190 --> 03:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
new hampshire so she can be closer to
 
03:03:21.110 --> 03:03:21.120 align:start position:0%
family in northern new england
 
03:03:21.120 --> 03:03:22.070 align:start position:0%
family in northern new england
and

03:03:22.070 --> 03:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:03:25.269 --> 03:03:25.279 align:start position:0%
she's great acupuncturist and maintains
 
03:03:26.790 --> 03:03:26.800 align:start position:0%
a license in good standing in
 
03:03:29.110 --> 03:03:29.120 align:start position:0%
massachusetts but she doesn't have the
 
03:03:31.429 --> 03:03:31.439 align:start position:0%
current active status with ncc aom and
 
03:03:33.190 --> 03:03:33.200 align:start position:0%
so that keeps her from moving to new
 
03:03:33.200 --> 03:03:34.550 align:start position:0%
so that keeps her from moving to new
hampshire

03:03:34.550 --> 03:03:34.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
03:03:34.560 --> 03:03:35.349 align:start position:0%
hampshire
and

03:03:35.349 --> 03:03:35.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:03:39.190 --> 03:03:39.200 align:start position:0%
another one of my 11 12 letters is from
 
03:03:41.510 --> 03:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
our accountant he points out that the
 
03:03:45.349 --> 03:03:45.359 align:start position:0%
ncc aom is a trade association and i do
 
03:03:47.110 --> 03:03:47.120 align:start position:0%
have their financials
 
03:03:49.269 --> 03:03:49.279 align:start position:0%
from a website that tracks nonprofits
 
03:03:51.510 --> 03:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
they're actually listed as a business or
 
03:03:53.750 --> 03:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
industry association not a certifying
 
03:03:53.760 --> 03:03:55.110 align:start position:0%
industry association not a certifying
body

03:03:55.110 --> 03:03:55.120 align:start position:0%
body
 
03:03:57.110 --> 03:03:57.120 align:start position:0%
and i pointed out before that their
 
03:03:59.030 --> 03:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
chief operating officer cory ward cook
 
03:04:01.510 --> 03:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
when she stepped down in 2019 her salary
 
03:04:04.389 --> 03:04:04.399 align:start position:0%
was over a quarter of a million dollars
 
03:04:06.710 --> 03:04:06.720 align:start position:0%
and by law in new hampshire we have to
 
03:04:08.309 --> 03:04:08.319 align:start position:0%
pay them and keep active status with
 
03:04:09.990 --> 03:04:10.000 align:start position:0%
them whether we want to or not whether
 
03:04:11.510 --> 03:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
we feel like they represent us at the
 
03:04:14.469 --> 03:04:14.479 align:start position:0%
national level level or not
 
03:04:14.479 --> 03:04:15.590 align:start position:0%
national level level or not
um

03:04:15.590 --> 03:04:15.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:04:17.990 --> 03:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
and our accountant jefferson tickering
 
03:04:19.590 --> 03:04:19.600 align:start position:0%
points out that
 
03:04:22.389 --> 03:04:22.399 align:start position:0%
he was the chair of the accountancy
 
03:04:24.710 --> 03:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
board and the reason why he stopped is
 
03:04:26.550 --> 03:04:26.560 align:start position:0%
because he was term limited out after so
 
03:04:28.150 --> 03:04:28.160 align:start position:0%
many terms
 
03:04:30.469 --> 03:04:30.479 align:start position:0%
so that's my testimony and i'm gonna
 
03:04:32.469 --> 03:04:32.479 align:start position:0%
just go ahead and oh representative like
 
03:04:32.479 --> 03:04:36.630 align:start position:0%
just go ahead and oh representative like
is

03:04:36.630 --> 03:04:36.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:38.790 --> 03:04:38.800 align:start position:0%
thank you or a suggestion that is i
 
03:04:40.230 --> 03:04:40.240 align:start position:0%
would suggest
 
03:04:42.150 --> 03:04:42.160 align:start position:0%
i'll end up scheduling a subcommittee
 
03:04:43.429 --> 03:04:43.439 align:start position:0%
work session
 
03:04:45.990 --> 03:04:46.000 align:start position:0%
and i suggest everybody who's there's an
 
03:04:48.230 --> 03:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
interest in this come with
 
03:04:50.630 --> 03:04:50.640 align:start position:0%
suggested language and we can thrash
 
03:04:52.790 --> 03:04:52.800 align:start position:0%
through it and hopefully this time get
 
03:04:54.389 --> 03:04:54.399 align:start position:0%
everybody to agree
 
03:04:57.510 --> 03:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
on one thing so okay excellent
 
03:05:00.150 --> 03:05:00.160 align:start position:0%
the deadline for this bill is
 
03:05:03.030 --> 03:05:03.040 align:start position:0%
the 28th so we'll probably be executing
 
03:05:05.110 --> 03:05:05.120 align:start position:0%
it on the 25th
 
03:05:06.790 --> 03:05:06.800 align:start position:0%
4th or 25th
 
03:05:10.150 --> 03:05:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:10.160 --> 03:05:11.349 align:start position:0%
 
but

03:05:11.349 --> 03:05:11.359 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:05:12.790 --> 03:05:12.800 align:start position:0%
i hope there's hope there's no other
 
03:05:12.800 --> 03:05:14.630 align:start position:0%
i hope there's hope there's no other
questions

03:05:14.630 --> 03:05:14.640 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:05:20.710 --> 03:05:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:22.469 --> 03:05:22.479 align:start position:0%
hi i'm a licensed acupuncturist from
 
03:05:24.630 --> 03:05:24.640 align:start position:0%
orford new hampshire
 
03:05:26.710 --> 03:05:26.720 align:start position:0%
i'm an advocate for legislative
 
03:05:29.429 --> 03:05:29.439 align:start position:0%
improvements in laws across the country
 
03:05:31.590 --> 03:05:31.600 align:start position:0%
to unwarranted restrictions on practice
 
03:05:33.910 --> 03:05:33.920 align:start position:0%
which only increase over the 30 years
 
03:05:35.110 --> 03:05:35.120 align:start position:0%
i've been
 
03:05:36.389 --> 03:05:36.399 align:start position:0%
passing laws
 
03:05:37.670 --> 03:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
in the u.s
 
03:05:39.429 --> 03:05:39.439 align:start position:0%
so we're just asking a couple very
 
03:05:41.990 --> 03:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
direct things i believe we have had a
 
03:05:44.230 --> 03:05:44.240 align:start position:0%
hearing on this already i believe we are
 
03:05:48.389 --> 03:05:48.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:50.230 --> 03:05:50.240 align:start position:0%
i just want to say in chinese medicine
 
03:05:52.550 --> 03:05:52.560 align:start position:0%
one of the principles we talk about
 
03:05:55.590 --> 03:05:55.600 align:start position:0%
and treat is stagnation
 
03:05:57.349 --> 03:05:57.359 align:start position:0%
we'd like to get rid of the regulation
 
03:05:59.269 --> 03:05:59.279 align:start position:0%
that enables stagnation in our
 
03:05:59.279 --> 03:06:00.630 align:start position:0%
that enables stagnation in our
profession

03:06:00.630 --> 03:06:00.640 align:start position:0%
profession
 
03:06:03.429 --> 03:06:03.439 align:start position:0%
and this bill puts in reciprocity if you
 
03:06:06.230 --> 03:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
pass the bill we're asking you to pass
 
03:06:08.230 --> 03:06:08.240 align:start position:0%
anybody from any other state with a
 
03:06:11.910 --> 03:06:11.920 align:start position:0%
license can practice here automatically
 
03:06:13.910 --> 03:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
right now the way the licensing board
 
03:06:16.950 --> 03:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
has delineated things 28 states do not
 
03:06:19.510 --> 03:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
meet our standards
 
03:06:21.910 --> 03:06:21.920 align:start position:0%
massachusetts is one california is one
 
03:06:23.990 --> 03:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
florida's one they all have lots more
 
03:06:26.710 --> 03:06:26.720 align:start position:0%
regulation than we do on acupuncture
 
03:06:29.590 --> 03:06:29.600 align:start position:0%
and in fact in five states there are 17
 
03:06:31.510 --> 03:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
000 acupunctures that new hampshire
 
03:06:33.349 --> 03:06:33.359 align:start position:0%
licensing board deems not safe enough to
 
03:06:34.550 --> 03:06:34.560 align:start position:0%
practice here
 
03:06:36.389 --> 03:06:36.399 align:start position:0%
after they've been practicing in other
 
03:06:39.190 --> 03:06:39.200 align:start position:0%
states so that doesn't make sense to me
 
03:06:39.200 --> 03:06:40.150 align:start position:0%
states so that doesn't make sense to me
if

03:06:40.150 --> 03:06:40.160 align:start position:0%
if
 
03:06:41.190 --> 03:06:41.200 align:start position:0%
i think
 
03:06:42.870 --> 03:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure how many states don't have
 
03:06:45.349 --> 03:06:45.359 align:start position:0%
laws anymore i oklahoma's the only one i
 
03:06:46.469 --> 03:06:46.479 align:start position:0%
know of
 
03:06:48.309 --> 03:06:48.319 align:start position:0%
but we're really saying that nobody else
 
03:06:49.910 --> 03:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
is practicing in another state can
 
03:06:51.590 --> 03:06:51.600 align:start position:0%
practice here when they apply for a
 
03:06:53.670 --> 03:06:53.680 align:start position:0%
license this means something to me
 
03:06:55.110 --> 03:06:55.120 align:start position:0%
because it took me a year and a half to
 
03:06:56.950 --> 03:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
get a license here it cost me seventeen
 
03:06:58.469 --> 03:06:58.479 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars
 
03:07:00.550 --> 03:07:00.560 align:start position:0%
so i would really like this law fixed
 
03:07:03.030 --> 03:07:03.040 align:start position:0%
and i believe the amendments we
 
03:07:05.830 --> 03:07:05.840 align:start position:0%
submitted originally represented lycus
 
03:07:08.830 --> 03:07:08.840 align:start position:0%
you have them i have
 
03:07:11.590 --> 03:07:11.600 align:start position:0%
everything in my grubby little hands yes
 
03:07:13.030 --> 03:07:13.040 align:start position:0%
this is a different bill this is the
 
03:07:15.429 --> 03:07:15.439 align:start position:0%
senate bill rather than the house bill
 
03:07:15.439 --> 03:07:16.230 align:start position:0%
senate bill rather than the house bill
and

03:07:16.230 --> 03:07:16.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:07:16.240 --> 03:07:17.429 align:start position:0%
and
um

03:07:17.429 --> 03:07:17.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:07:20.070 --> 03:07:20.080 align:start position:0%
like i said the intent is to take the
 
03:07:22.309 --> 03:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
work we did on the house bill
 
03:07:27.190 --> 03:07:27.200 align:start position:0%
and and folded into this
 
03:07:27.200 --> 03:07:28.469 align:start position:0%
and and folded into this
great

03:07:28.469 --> 03:07:28.479 align:start position:0%
great
 
03:07:30.150 --> 03:07:30.160 align:start position:0%
so i don't need to say anything else is
 
03:07:31.349 --> 03:07:31.359 align:start position:0%
that correct
 
03:07:33.349 --> 03:07:33.359 align:start position:0%
sounds good to me is there anyone else
 
03:07:35.030 --> 03:07:35.040 align:start position:0%
who are there any other questions from
 
03:07:36.790 --> 03:07:36.800 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
03:07:38.710 --> 03:07:38.720 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none thank you miss
 
03:07:38.720 --> 03:07:39.670 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none thank you miss

03:08:17.590 --> 03:08:17.600 align:start position:0%
i'm here on behalf of our membership
 
03:08:19.510 --> 03:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
we held a meeting in early january to
 
03:08:22.870 --> 03:08:22.880 align:start position:0%
gauge member support for sb 282
 
03:08:24.630 --> 03:08:24.640 align:start position:0%
and we are unanimous in support of our
 
03:08:26.070 --> 03:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
fellow colleagues that go above and
 
03:08:27.670 --> 03:08:27.680 align:start position:0%
beyond the typical master's degree to
 
03:08:29.269 --> 03:08:29.279 align:start position:0%
get their doctorate
 
03:08:31.510 --> 03:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
most acupuncturists in the state
 
03:08:33.590 --> 03:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
hold a master's degree from a four-year
 
03:08:35.910 --> 03:08:35.920 align:start position:0%
graduate program and we agree that those
 
03:08:37.670 --> 03:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
that go beyond the typical four years to
 
03:08:39.830 --> 03:08:39.840 align:start position:0%
their get their doctorate should take on

for the licensing board
 
03:08:49.349 --> 03:08:49.359 align:start position:0%
this would streamline licensing renewal
 
03:08:50.630 --> 03:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
and we had a discussion about the
 
03:08:52.309 --> 03:08:52.319 align:start position:0%
supervision of acupuncture detox
 
03:08:53.990 --> 03:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
specialists and shared our recommended
 
03:08:55.990 --> 03:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
changes to the first draft of the bill
 
03:08:57.190 --> 03:08:57.200 align:start position:0%

as it is stated in the amended bill you
 
03:09:00.630 --> 03:09:00.640 align:start position:0%
have before you we agree that
 
03:09:02.230 --> 03:09:02.240 align:start position:0%
acupuncture should be supporting
 
03:09:04.870 --> 03:09:04.880 align:start position:0%

supervision
 
03:09:07.990 --> 03:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
this bill will allow supervision to be
 
03:09:10.309 --> 03:09:10.319 align:start position:0%
more flexible allowing for in-person or
 
03:09:12.309 --> 03:09:12.319 align:start position:0%
virtual check-ins i pulled our
 
03:09:13.910 --> 03:09:13.920 align:start position:0%

03:09:16.070 --> 03:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
those who responded no one had been
 
03:09:17.910 --> 03:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
asked to supervise and there are a
 
03:09:19.349 --> 03:09:19.359 align:start position:0%

licensing board and as you folks know
 
03:10:44.389 --> 03:10:44.399 align:start position:0%
this bill senate bill 282 mirrors the
 
03:10:47.910 --> 03:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
language in house bill 1192
 
03:10:50.550 --> 03:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
those amendments that you see are from
 
03:10:52.229 --> 03:10:52.239 align:start position:0%
the board of acupuncture licensing in
 
03:10:53.750 --> 03:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
both of those bills so we're in
 
03:10:55.510 --> 03:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
agreement with the amendments as they
 
03:10:55.520 --> 03:10:57.670 align:start position:0%
agreement with the amendments as they
are

03:10:57.670 --> 03:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:10:59.750 --> 03:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
the only additional thing that we had
 
03:11:02.229 --> 03:11:02.239 align:start position:0%
hoped to do was
 
03:11:05.110 --> 03:11:05.120 align:start position:0%
move away from the word oriental and
 
03:11:07.269 --> 03:11:07.279 align:start position:0%
that was put into the statute back 20
 
03:11:10.550 --> 03:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
years ago when it was first enacted
 
03:11:13.030 --> 03:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
and so that word is a pejorative word
 
03:11:13.040 --> 03:11:13.910 align:start position:0%
and so that word is a pejorative word
now

03:11:13.910 --> 03:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:11:15.670 --> 03:11:15.680 align:start position:0%
thought by many and we're trying to move
 
03:11:17.269 --> 03:11:17.279 align:start position:0%
away from it as
 
03:11:19.349 --> 03:11:19.359 align:start position:0%
many of the standard setters in our
 
03:11:22.150 --> 03:11:22.160 align:start position:0%
profession are doing and so we suggested
 
03:11:25.269 --> 03:11:25.279 align:start position:0%
moving it to the word asian instead
 
03:11:27.110 --> 03:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
with the exception of there's a couple
 
03:11:29.910 --> 03:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
of organizations in that statute that
 
03:11:31.190 --> 03:11:31.200 align:start position:0%
are named who
 
03:11:31.200 --> 03:11:32.630 align:start position:0%
are named who
have

03:11:32.630 --> 03:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:11:34.870 --> 03:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
not yet changed their name so one of
 
03:11:38.309 --> 03:11:38.319 align:start position:0%
them was the ncc aom
 
03:11:41.910 --> 03:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
nccom is the certifying body it i'm not
 
03:11:44.309 --> 03:11:44.319 align:start position:0%
sure of their legal corporation status
 
03:11:46.710 --> 03:11:46.720 align:start position:0%
but they are the
 
03:11:49.190 --> 03:11:49.200 align:start position:0%
standards setter for competency
 
03:11:51.190 --> 03:11:51.200 align:start position:0%
nationally for board-certifying
 
03:11:53.510 --> 03:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
acupuncturists throughout the united
 
03:11:53.520 --> 03:11:54.790 align:start position:0%
acupuncturists throughout the united
states

03:11:54.790 --> 03:11:54.800 align:start position:0%
states
 
03:11:58.070 --> 03:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
but they are still called the ncca om
 
03:12:00.389 --> 03:12:00.399 align:start position:0%
for acupuncture and oriental medicine so
 
03:12:02.150 --> 03:12:02.160 align:start position:0%
as it's written in the statute that
 
03:12:04.550 --> 03:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
would have to stay as it is
 
03:12:05.830 --> 03:12:05.840 align:start position:0%
there is another
 
03:12:08.790 --> 03:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
body the accrediting body for schools
 
03:12:11.110 --> 03:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
and colleges that teach
 
03:12:13.510 --> 03:12:13.520 align:start position:0%
post-secondary acupuncture programs and
 
03:12:15.830 --> 03:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
that is the aca
 
03:12:18.790 --> 03:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
om it used to be om but they actually
 
03:12:22.070 --> 03:12:22.080 align:start position:0%
have changed their name to the aca hm
 
03:12:23.590 --> 03:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
which stands for
 
03:12:25.349 --> 03:12:25.359 align:start position:0%
the accrediting commission for
 
03:12:28.229 --> 03:12:28.239 align:start position:0%
acupuncture and herbal medicine so since
 
03:12:30.229 --> 03:12:30.239 align:start position:0%
they have already changed their name we
 
03:12:31.510 --> 03:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
thought it would be appropriate to
 
03:12:34.389 --> 03:12:34.399 align:start position:0%
change it in our statute as well
 
03:12:37.190 --> 03:12:37.200 align:start position:0%
so just that i was speaking with senator
 
03:12:37.200 --> 03:12:38.229 align:start position:0%
so just that i was speaking with senator
reagan

03:12:38.229 --> 03:12:38.239 align:start position:0%
reagan
 
03:12:40.950 --> 03:12:40.960 align:start position:0%
about other amendments relating to to
 
03:12:42.790 --> 03:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
continuing education
 
03:12:42.800 --> 03:12:43.750 align:start position:0%
continuing education
um

03:12:43.750 --> 03:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:12:46.469 --> 03:12:46.479 align:start position:0%
and what he suggested was that that we
 
03:12:46.479 --> 03:12:47.349 align:start position:0%
and what he suggested was that that we
just

03:12:47.349 --> 03:12:47.359 align:start position:0%
just
 
03:12:50.469 --> 03:12:50.479 align:start position:0%
give a get our get some
 
03:12:53.190 --> 03:12:53.200 align:start position:0%
get a completed statute adoptable as a
 
03:12:55.910 --> 03:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
replace all amendment um and so that
 
03:12:57.670 --> 03:12:57.680 align:start position:0%
will be forthcoming for us and the
 
03:12:59.269 --> 03:12:59.279 align:start position:0%
reason why we want to change what's
 
03:13:01.110 --> 03:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
written in the statute about continuing
 
03:13:01.120 --> 03:13:02.469 align:start position:0%
written in the statute about continuing
education

03:13:02.469 --> 03:13:02.479 align:start position:0%
education
 
03:13:04.229 --> 03:13:04.239 align:start position:0%
is actually to make it easier for
 
03:13:06.550 --> 03:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
licensees to get their continuing ad
 
03:13:06.560 --> 03:13:08.469 align:start position:0%
licensees to get their continuing ad
units

03:13:08.469 --> 03:13:08.479 align:start position:0%
units
 
03:13:10.710 --> 03:13:10.720 align:start position:0%
we had made an amendment
 
03:13:10.720 --> 03:13:11.510 align:start position:0%
we had made an amendment
and

03:13:11.510 --> 03:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:13:13.510 --> 03:13:13.520 align:start position:0%
the way that was interpreted by our
 
03:13:15.429 --> 03:13:15.439 align:start position:0%
board council was that it would look
 
03:13:17.349 --> 03:13:17.359 align:start position:0%
like the only way that they could get
 
03:13:19.910 --> 03:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
their continuing ed units would be if
 
03:13:22.630 --> 03:13:22.640 align:start position:0%
they were through the ncc aom and that's
 
03:13:24.469 --> 03:13:24.479 align:start position:0%
not what we wanted we want people to be
 
03:13:26.389 --> 03:13:26.399 align:start position:0%
able to get their continuing ed units in
 
03:13:29.349 --> 03:13:29.359 align:start position:0%
other ways so we'll be working on that
 
03:13:29.359 --> 03:13:30.550 align:start position:0%
other ways so we'll be working on that
okay

03:13:30.550 --> 03:13:30.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:13:33.590 --> 03:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for that yeah it is
 
03:13:35.030 --> 03:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
something that the
 
03:13:36.790 --> 03:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
subcommittee will be looking at i hope
 
03:13:38.469 --> 03:13:38.479 align:start position:0%
you will support
 
03:13:38.479 --> 03:13:40.070 align:start position:0%
you will support
and

03:13:40.070 --> 03:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:13:41.750 --> 03:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
actually looks to me
 
03:13:44.710 --> 03:13:44.720 align:start position:0%
if you look on page 2 line 30
 
03:13:47.349 --> 03:13:47.359 align:start position:0%
but continuing education
 
03:13:49.910 --> 03:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
it deletes two sentences
 
03:13:52.790 --> 03:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
and adds one i think that you just
 
03:13:54.710 --> 03:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
leave the first sentence as is and
 
03:13:57.030 --> 03:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
simply delete the second sentence the
 
03:13:59.670 --> 03:13:59.680 align:start position:0%
the suggestion that was made um by our
 
03:14:01.429 --> 03:14:01.439 align:start position:0%
board council which i think is a good
 
03:14:02.550 --> 03:14:02.560 align:start position:0%
idea is
 
03:14:04.870 --> 03:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
pretty close to what you just said um
 
03:14:07.670 --> 03:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
and what we thought we would do is say
 
03:14:10.950 --> 03:14:10.960 align:start position:0%
um that they can use they can get their
 
03:14:13.590 --> 03:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
continuing ed units but leave the number
 
03:14:16.389 --> 03:14:16.399 align:start position:0%
of hours out and actually address that
 
03:14:16.399 --> 03:14:17.349 align:start position:0%
of hours out and actually address that
rules

03:14:17.349 --> 03:14:17.359 align:start position:0%
rules
 
03:14:19.750 --> 03:14:19.760 align:start position:0%
to expound upon the number of hours that
 
03:14:21.510 --> 03:14:21.520 align:start position:0%
are required in the rules that that
 
03:14:23.349 --> 03:14:23.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't really need to be in the statute
 
03:14:24.389 --> 03:14:24.399 align:start position:0%
that's what our
 
03:14:27.190 --> 03:14:27.200 align:start position:0%
that's what was suggested the other
 
03:14:27.200 --> 03:14:29.269 align:start position:0%
that's what was suggested the other
um

03:14:29.269 --> 03:14:29.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:14:29.279 --> 03:14:29.990 align:start position:0%
um
i

03:14:29.990 --> 03:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
i
 
03:14:31.990 --> 03:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
that's a policy decision whether it's in
 
03:14:33.990 --> 03:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
statute or in rule so we'll consider
 
03:14:36.630 --> 03:14:36.640 align:start position:0%
your position
 
03:14:38.389 --> 03:14:38.399 align:start position:0%
okay good
 
03:14:42.070 --> 03:14:42.080 align:start position:0%
and he went works in black us yeah um
 
03:14:45.110 --> 03:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
so i looked through both 1192 and 282
 
03:14:47.190 --> 03:14:47.200 align:start position:0%
and the word um
 
03:14:49.110 --> 03:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
oriental isn't in there other than in
 
03:14:51.110 --> 03:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
the initials for that one organization
 
03:14:53.110 --> 03:14:53.120 align:start position:0%
so are you asking for
 
03:14:55.670 --> 03:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
changes elsewhere in the statutes
 
03:14:57.030 --> 03:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
as opposed to just changes in the
 
03:14:58.389 --> 03:14:58.399 align:start position:0%
current bills
 
03:15:00.870 --> 03:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
so the word oriental actually appears
 
03:15:03.750 --> 03:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
nine times throughout the entire statute
 
03:15:05.910 --> 03:15:05.920 align:start position:0%
representative lacus so we were looking
 
03:15:07.510 --> 03:15:07.520 align:start position:0%
to change that
 
03:15:09.590 --> 03:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
all right thank you okay thank you up to
 
03:15:09.600 --> 03:15:11.110 align:start position:0%
all right thank you okay thank you up to
you

03:15:11.110 --> 03:15:11.120 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:15:13.510 --> 03:15:13.520 align:start position:0%
representative judy yes thank you madam
 
03:15:13.520 --> 03:15:14.710 align:start position:0%
representative judy yes thank you madam
chair

03:15:14.710 --> 03:15:14.720 align:start position:0%
chair
 
03:15:18.389 --> 03:15:18.399 align:start position:0%
as you are a chair of this organization
 
03:15:20.950 --> 03:15:20.960 align:start position:0%
how many doctors we have here in new
 
03:15:23.269 --> 03:15:23.279 align:start position:0%
hampshire doctors of
 
03:15:26.150 --> 03:15:26.160 align:start position:0%
acupuncture i would have to ballpark it
 
03:15:28.309 --> 03:15:28.319 align:start position:0%
and i i think there it's a growing
 
03:15:30.150 --> 03:15:30.160 align:start position:0%
number but it's it's somewhere under
 
03:15:33.269 --> 03:15:33.279 align:start position:0%
five right now it's a recently
 
03:15:36.070 --> 03:15:36.080 align:start position:0%
established program the doctorate in
 
03:15:38.309 --> 03:15:38.319 align:start position:0%
acupuncture so it's something that's new
 
03:15:40.469 --> 03:15:40.479 align:start position:0%
and we just want to allow for
 
03:15:42.630 --> 03:15:42.640 align:start position:0%
those people who've gone and gotten that
 
03:15:44.229 --> 03:15:44.239 align:start position:0%
degree to be able to use the title
 
03:15:45.990 --> 03:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
there's not many yet i would say under
 
03:15:49.830 --> 03:15:49.840 align:start position:0%
five we have 153 licensees total
 
03:15:51.910 --> 03:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
okay all right thank you thank you thank
 
03:15:55.910 --> 03:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:57.830 --> 03:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
yes representative allegro
 
03:15:59.429 --> 03:15:59.439 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm just curious to know what
 
03:15:59.439 --> 03:16:00.229 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm just curious to know what
the

03:16:00.229 --> 03:16:00.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:16:01.750 --> 03:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
degree requirements are can you
 
03:16:04.150 --> 03:16:04.160 align:start position:0%
summarize them in a minute
 
03:16:06.950 --> 03:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
sure well for a licensed acupuncturist
 
03:16:08.590 --> 03:16:08.600 align:start position:0%
you have to have
 
03:16:13.190 --> 03:16:13.200 align:start position:0%
1905 hours and a master's degree
 
03:16:15.030 --> 03:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
so there's different levels of
 
03:16:17.269 --> 03:16:17.279 align:start position:0%
acupuncture providers in the state of
 
03:16:18.550 --> 03:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
03:16:20.950 --> 03:16:20.960 align:start position:0%
and the top level would be the doctoral
 
03:16:22.790 --> 03:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
degree i don't know off the top of my
 
03:16:24.550 --> 03:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
head how many hours that is but it's
 
03:16:26.469 --> 03:16:26.479 align:start position:0%
above and beyond the master's degree
 
03:16:28.790 --> 03:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
obviously so it goes doctoral and then
 
03:16:31.710 --> 03:16:31.720 align:start position:0%
masters and then we have the acupuncture
 
03:16:34.309 --> 03:16:34.319 align:start position:0%
detoxification specialists who
 
03:16:36.710 --> 03:16:36.720 align:start position:0%
are required to have 30 hours of
 
03:16:39.910 --> 03:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
classroom time and 40 hours of practice
 
03:16:41.750 --> 03:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
time under the supervision of a licensed
 
03:16:41.760 --> 03:16:43.190 align:start position:0%
time under the supervision of a licensed
acupuncturist

03:16:43.190 --> 03:16:43.200 align:start position:0%

03:18:43.030 --> 03:18:43.040 align:start position:0%
that's what happened
 
03:18:45.030 --> 03:18:45.040 align:start position:0%
everybody forgot or they came up with
 
03:18:47.030 --> 03:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
new requirements like combing the

senate bill 330 and i call senator guida
 
03:31:08.389 --> 03:31:08.399 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair members of the
 
03:31:10.070 --> 03:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
committee for the record bob geider
 
03:31:12.630 --> 03:31:12.640 align:start position:0%
senate district 2.
 
03:31:17.750 --> 03:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:19.510 --> 03:31:19.520 align:start position:0%
we've already been before you at least
 
03:31:21.510 --> 03:31:21.520 align:start position:0%
once that i can recall on issues related
 
03:31:23.349 --> 03:31:23.359 align:start position:0%
to oplc and
 
03:31:26.070 --> 03:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
transitioning that into the position and
 
03:31:28.309 --> 03:31:28.319 align:start position:0%
with appropriate authorities and and
 
03:31:29.990 --> 03:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
consultancies that are required to make
 
03:31:31.910 --> 03:31:31.920 align:start position:0%
it function that was intended
 
03:31:34.309 --> 03:31:34.319 align:start position:0%
uh the oplc has been
 
03:31:34.319 --> 03:31:35.590 align:start position:0%
uh the oplc has been
um

03:31:35.590 --> 03:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:31:37.750 --> 03:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
if you will morphing for about the last
 
03:31:39.510 --> 03:31:39.520 align:start position:0%
seven or eight years through a number of
 
03:31:43.269 --> 03:31:43.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:45.030 --> 03:31:45.040 align:start position:0%
relocating which blew their budget out
 
03:31:46.309 --> 03:31:46.319 align:start position:0%
of the water
 
03:31:47.349 --> 03:31:47.359 align:start position:0%
and a
 
03:31:49.190 --> 03:31:49.200 align:start position:0%
number of other challenges we have a
 
03:31:51.030 --> 03:31:51.040 align:start position:0%
very competent executive director now in
 
03:31:52.550 --> 03:31:52.560 align:start position:0%
lindsay courtney
 
03:31:54.870 --> 03:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
it was at her request and with my
 
03:31:57.110 --> 03:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
suggestion as well that we put 3 30
 
03:31:58.309 --> 03:31:58.319 align:start position:0%
together here
 
03:32:01.030 --> 03:32:01.040 align:start position:0%
uh it does a number of things first
 
03:32:02.950 --> 03:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
establishes a study committee to make
 
03:32:02.960 --> 03:32:04.630 align:start position:0%
establishes a study committee to make
recommendations

03:32:04.630 --> 03:32:04.640 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
03:32:07.269 --> 03:32:07.279 align:start position:0%
about how the board the oplc should
 
03:32:09.349 --> 03:32:09.359 align:start position:0%
interact with the variances in licensor
 
03:32:09.359 --> 03:32:10.229 align:start position:0%
interact with the variances in licensor
boards

03:32:10.229 --> 03:32:10.239 align:start position:0%
boards
 
03:32:11.670 --> 03:32:11.680 align:start position:0%
and commissions over which it has
 
03:32:11.680 --> 03:32:13.110 align:start position:0%
and commissions over which it has
authority

03:32:13.110 --> 03:32:13.120 align:start position:0%
authority
 
03:32:14.870 --> 03:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
as you might
 
03:32:18.550 --> 03:32:18.560 align:start position:0%
suspect when a change in hierarchy or a
 
03:32:19.910 --> 03:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
change in structure takes place
 
03:32:22.150 --> 03:32:22.160 align:start position:0%
sometimes there are difficulties in
 
03:32:25.190 --> 03:32:25.200 align:start position:0%
establishing lines of communication
 
03:32:26.630 --> 03:32:26.640 align:start position:0%
lines of authority
 
03:32:28.950 --> 03:32:28.960 align:start position:0%
and so forth and so for that reason the
 
03:32:31.349 --> 03:32:31.359 align:start position:0%
study committee is i'm quite sure very
 
03:32:31.359 --> 03:32:32.710 align:start position:0%
study committee is i'm quite sure very
necessary

03:32:32.710 --> 03:32:32.720 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
03:32:34.950 --> 03:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
this bill grew out of a
 
03:32:36.870 --> 03:32:36.880 align:start position:0%
omnibus bill pardon my using foul
 
03:32:36.880 --> 03:32:37.830 align:start position:0%
omnibus bill pardon my using foul
language

03:32:37.830 --> 03:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
language
 
03:32:39.190 --> 03:32:39.200 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:32:41.750 --> 03:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh that was i think the longest i've it
 
03:32:44.309 --> 03:32:44.319 align:start position:0%
was 73 pages long and that was probably
 
03:32:46.070 --> 03:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
a little bit too long and of course with
 
03:32:47.830 --> 03:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
covid that was the end of that but this
 
03:32:49.990 --> 03:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
is a necessary study committee and i'd
 
03:32:51.590 --> 03:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
ask the committee to
 
03:32:53.429 --> 03:32:53.439 align:start position:0%
to move forward with it
 
03:32:55.510 --> 03:32:55.520 align:start position:0%
two other things that it does it deals
 
03:32:57.429 --> 03:32:57.439 align:start position:0%
with bringing the
 
03:32:58.870 --> 03:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
boxing and wrestling commission over
 
03:33:00.630 --> 03:33:00.640 align:start position:0%
onto oplc currently attached to
 
03:33:02.870 --> 03:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
secretary of state and the revenues for
 
03:33:04.229 --> 03:33:04.239 align:start position:0%
which currently all accrue to the
 
03:33:05.590 --> 03:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
general fund
 
03:33:08.229 --> 03:33:08.239 align:start position:0%
uh that according to lba that i just did
 
03:33:09.830 --> 03:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
research with
 
03:33:11.670 --> 03:33:11.680 align:start position:0%
uh and the third thing of course it does
 
03:33:13.349 --> 03:33:13.359 align:start position:0%
is it deals with the
 
03:33:15.910 --> 03:33:15.920 align:start position:0%
uh board of forestry or a foreign of
 
03:33:17.830 --> 03:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
foresters pardon me
 
03:33:19.830 --> 03:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
it does a little bit to adjust the terms
 
03:33:21.750 --> 03:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
to make it more rational and how people
 
03:33:23.830 --> 03:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
get replaced on those boards
 
03:33:25.429 --> 03:33:25.439 align:start position:0%
and that is pretty much the summation of
 
03:33:28.229 --> 03:33:28.239 align:start position:0%
what senate bill 330 fn accomplishes i
 
03:33:31.110 --> 03:33:31.120 align:start position:0%
would certainly welcome any questions
 
03:33:32.790 --> 03:33:32.800 align:start position:0%
thank you senator are there questions
 
03:33:34.790 --> 03:33:34.800 align:start position:0%
representative blackis thank you you may
 
03:33:36.150 --> 03:33:36.160 align:start position:0%
have just answered my question but i
 
03:33:37.429 --> 03:33:37.439 align:start position:0%
want to make sure
 
03:33:39.269 --> 03:33:39.279 align:start position:0%
and that is after the transition from
 
03:33:41.269 --> 03:33:41.279 align:start position:0%
the wrestling board to oplc
 
03:33:43.269 --> 03:33:43.279 align:start position:0%
i couldn't see anything that said where
 
03:33:44.950 --> 03:33:44.960 align:start position:0%
you know they have this taxing and fees
 
03:33:47.269 --> 03:33:47.279 align:start position:0%
and everything so above cost is that
 
03:33:48.550 --> 03:33:48.560 align:start position:0%
still going to go to the general fund
 
03:33:51.349 --> 03:33:51.359 align:start position:0%
does it not need to be explicitly stated
 
03:33:53.429 --> 03:33:53.439 align:start position:0%
according to lba everything they raise
 
03:33:55.990 --> 03:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
goes into the general fund okay fees and
 
03:33:57.670 --> 03:33:57.680 align:start position:0%
of course
 
03:33:59.190 --> 03:33:59.200 align:start position:0%
whatever inspections they have to
 
03:34:03.429 --> 03:34:03.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:05.990 --> 03:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
represent goalie
 
03:34:07.670 --> 03:34:07.680 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you senator
 
03:34:09.190 --> 03:34:09.200 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
03:34:09.200 --> 03:34:11.750 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
um

03:34:11.750 --> 03:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:13.830 --> 03:34:13.840 align:start position:0%
not very familiar with the boxing
 
03:34:15.510 --> 03:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
wrestling commission
 
03:34:15.520 --> 03:34:16.630 align:start position:0%
wrestling commission
but

03:34:16.630 --> 03:34:16.640 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:34:19.510 --> 03:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
do they license anyone or regulate
 
03:34:21.429 --> 03:34:21.439 align:start position:0%
anyone or i mean why would we put them
 
03:34:22.950 --> 03:34:22.960 align:start position:0%
in oplc
 
03:34:24.870 --> 03:34:24.880 align:start position:0%
unless they are actually handing out
 
03:34:26.950 --> 03:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
licenses so what they do amongst other
 
03:34:28.550 --> 03:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
things they
 
03:34:31.110 --> 03:34:31.120 align:start position:0%
they license any event like an mma event
 
03:34:33.349 --> 03:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
or stuff like that and the licensure is
 
03:34:35.670 --> 03:34:35.680 align:start position:0%
is required to make sure that the proper
 
03:34:37.510 --> 03:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
medical personnel are there
 
03:34:40.309 --> 03:34:40.319 align:start position:0%
uh that the proper protocols for
 
03:34:40.319 --> 03:34:41.190 align:start position:0%
uh that the proper protocols for
um

03:34:41.190 --> 03:34:41.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:34:43.030 --> 03:34:43.040 align:start position:0%
you know any of the events that they do
 
03:34:44.950 --> 03:34:44.960 align:start position:0%
is there that's an oversight board
 
03:34:46.229 --> 03:34:46.239 align:start position:0%
basically that that makes sure that
 
03:34:47.910 --> 03:34:47.920 align:start position:0%
everything's kosher and being
 
03:34:52.710 --> 03:34:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:52.720 --> 03:34:54.950 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

03:34:54.950 --> 03:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
03:34:59.510 --> 03:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
i i understand the licensing events but
 
03:35:02.309 --> 03:35:02.319 align:start position:0%
oplc licenses individuals and that's why
 
03:35:04.309 --> 03:35:04.319 align:start position:0%
i'm questioning why they're there
 
03:35:04.319 --> 03:35:05.670 align:start position:0%
i'm questioning why they're there
because

03:35:05.670 --> 03:35:05.680 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:35:08.229 --> 03:35:08.239 align:start position:0%
they are not overseeing individuals and
 
03:35:10.229 --> 03:35:10.239 align:start position:0%
prerequisites for actual individuals and
 
03:35:11.990 --> 03:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
licensing for you know where i'm going
 
03:35:15.030 --> 03:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
with this i do i'm not sure whether they
 
03:35:17.110 --> 03:35:17.120 align:start position:0%
license whether boxers and professional
 
03:35:18.710 --> 03:35:18.720 align:start position:0%
wrestlers have to be licensed i don't
 
03:35:20.389 --> 03:35:20.399 align:start position:0%
know the answer to that
 
03:35:23.429 --> 03:35:23.439 align:start position:0%
my suggestion would be that may be that
 
03:35:25.110 --> 03:35:25.120 align:start position:0%
the reason that they do this but again i
 
03:35:31.830 --> 03:35:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:34.070 --> 03:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair is it not the case
 
03:35:36.309 --> 03:35:36.319 align:start position:0%
as i understand it senator that
 
03:35:39.750 --> 03:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
that both managers and boxers wrestlers
 
03:35:41.590 --> 03:35:41.600 align:start position:0%
and so forth i don't really know about
 
03:35:44.550 --> 03:35:44.560 align:start position:0%
wrestling uh professional wrestling is a
 
03:35:46.469 --> 03:35:46.479 align:start position:0%
kind of special breed of cat but i
 
03:35:48.870 --> 03:35:48.880 align:start position:0%
believe boxers also have licenses i mean
 
03:35:51.269 --> 03:35:51.279 align:start position:0%
when muhammad ali was a heavyweight
 
03:35:55.110 --> 03:35:55.120 align:start position:0%
champion when he was uh he was uh
 
03:35:57.830 --> 03:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
had his what
 
03:36:00.469 --> 03:36:00.479 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm saying is it is it not the case
 
03:36:03.990 --> 03:36:04.000 align:start position:0%
that his boxing license was revoked uh
 
03:36:05.990 --> 03:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
would it not be the case that uh that
 
03:36:09.030 --> 03:36:09.040 align:start position:0%
are licensed uh that our boxers and
 
03:36:11.349 --> 03:36:11.359 align:start position:0%
wrestlers also potentially have to be
 
03:36:13.269 --> 03:36:13.279 align:start position:0%
licensed as well as their managers i
 
03:36:15.030 --> 03:36:15.040 align:start position:0%
would surmise that but i cannot state
 
03:36:17.590 --> 03:36:17.600 align:start position:0%
with authority that that's the case
 
03:36:20.150 --> 03:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
i agree i don't know it for a fact it
 
03:36:22.229 --> 03:36:22.239 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be hard to find out though yes
 
03:36:24.070 --> 03:36:24.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative pearson and
 
03:36:26.070 --> 03:36:26.080 align:start position:0%

that difference
 
03:37:06.150 --> 03:37:06.160 align:start position:0%

uh 20 and then there's some other things
 
03:37:28.880 --> 03:37:30.550 align:start position:0%
uh 20 and then there's some other things
so

03:37:30.550 --> 03:37:30.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:37:32.550 --> 03:37:32.560 align:start position:0%
if this is moving to oplc we might want
 
03:37:35.269 --> 03:37:35.279 align:start position:0%
to go with the general oplc of them
 
03:37:37.030 --> 03:37:37.040 align:start position:0%
setting the fees but otherwise yeah

03:38:33.349 --> 03:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
senator
 
03:38:35.590 --> 03:38:35.600 align:start position:0%
and he helped me get my license renewed
 
03:38:37.830 --> 03:38:37.840 align:start position:0%
when the licensing board
 
03:38:39.910 --> 03:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
told me they had no paperwork for me
 
03:38:42.150 --> 03:38:42.160 align:start position:0%
that i'd lapsed and i needed to fill out
 
03:38:44.229 --> 03:38:44.239 align:start position:0%
the original paperwork again which is
 
03:38:47.349 --> 03:38:47.359 align:start position:0%
stack about this high for me
 
03:38:49.670 --> 03:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
i support this study commission on
 
03:38:49.680 --> 03:38:51.030 align:start position:0%
i support this study commission on
reciprocity

03:38:51.030 --> 03:38:51.040 align:start position:0%
reciprocity
 
03:38:53.110 --> 03:38:53.120 align:start position:0%
our board is not the only one i train
 
03:38:54.870 --> 03:38:54.880 align:start position:0%
all kinds of mental health professionals
 
03:38:57.189 --> 03:38:57.199 align:start position:0%
and healthcare professionals
 
03:38:59.189 --> 03:38:59.199 align:start position:0%
seems like all of these
 
03:39:00.790 --> 03:39:00.800 align:start position:0%
these licenses have a real trouble
 
03:39:03.349 --> 03:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
getting reciprocity i read of a drug
 
03:39:05.349 --> 03:39:05.359 align:start position:0%
counselor in vermont that had been
 
03:39:07.269 --> 03:39:07.279 align:start position:0%
practicing in vermont for two years and
 
03:39:08.950 --> 03:39:08.960 align:start position:0%
still didn't have their license in new
 
03:39:12.229 --> 03:39:12.239 align:start position:0%
hampshire so it's obviously a problem in
 
03:39:14.790 --> 03:39:14.800 align:start position:0%
new hampshire i know our motto is live
 
03:39:16.550 --> 03:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
free or die but when it comes to our
 
03:39:18.870 --> 03:39:18.880 align:start position:0%
licensing boards
 
03:39:22.550 --> 03:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
it's a misnomer thank you very much okay
 
03:39:25.030 --> 03:39:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:25.040 --> 03:39:26.309 align:start position:0%
 
questions

03:39:26.309 --> 03:39:26.319 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:39:28.070 --> 03:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
yes none
 
03:39:29.670 --> 03:39:29.680 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to
 
03:39:35.750 --> 03:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:37.189 --> 03:39:37.199 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
03:39:40.469 --> 03:39:40.479 align:start position:0%
i will close the public hearing
 
03:39:42.870 --> 03:39:42.880 align:start position:0%
i have a question in the chair yes we've
 
03:39:44.469 --> 03:39:44.479 align:start position:0%
been using
 
03:39:47.750 --> 03:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
reciprocity seems to be a term that's
 
03:39:49.189 --> 03:39:49.199 align:start position:0%
fading away
 
03:39:52.309 --> 03:39:52.319 align:start position:0%
and being replaced with recognition are
 
03:39:55.189 --> 03:39:55.199 align:start position:0%
we do we really mean to say reciprocity
 
03:39:58.710 --> 03:39:58.720 align:start position:0%
or are we headed toward recognition
 
03:40:00.229 --> 03:40:00.239 align:start position:0%
are we going to maintain a distinction
 
03:40:04.150 --> 03:40:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:06.070 --> 03:40:06.080 align:start position:0%
i don't know
 
03:40:08.229 --> 03:40:08.239 align:start position:0%
well okay i thought i'd ask it's a good
 
03:40:09.910 --> 03:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
question it's a good question but i
 
03:40:12.790 --> 03:40:12.800 align:start position:0%
don't have an answer right now
 
03:40:15.510 --> 03:40:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:15.520 --> 03:40:17.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:40:17.990 --> 03:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:40:19.670 --> 03:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
well if i might i would just say in
 
03:40:21.590 --> 03:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
response to represent representative
 
03:40:24.229 --> 03:40:24.239 align:start position:0%
siddiq's question that i certainly do
 
03:40:25.750 --> 03:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
not think we want to drift into a
 
03:40:28.070 --> 03:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
circumstance in which we equate
 
03:40:30.630 --> 03:40:30.640 align:start position:0%
recognition and reciprocity since they
 
03:40:30.640 --> 03:40:32.469 align:start position:0%
recognition and reciprocity since they
are

03:40:32.469 --> 03:40:32.479 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:40:34.469 --> 03:40:34.479 align:start position:0%
related only by the fact that they get
 
03:40:36.630 --> 03:40:36.640 align:start position:0%
both began with re
 
03:40:38.229 --> 03:40:38.239 align:start position:0%
uh you know
 
03:40:42.070 --> 03:40:42.080 align:start position:0%
the thing of it is that reciprocity well
 
03:40:44.150 --> 03:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
i'm closing the public hearing on senate
 
03:40:46.550 --> 03:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
bill 330 and we are
 
03:40:49.110 --> 03:40:49.120 align:start position:0%
the reciprocity
 
03:40:51.590 --> 03:40:51.600 align:start position:0%
frequently requires a formal agreement
 
03:40:53.510 --> 03:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
between states
 
03:40:58.070 --> 03:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
what we want to do is find a way to
 
03:41:01.110 --> 03:41:01.120 align:start position:0%
acknowledge the the licenses
 
03:41:03.429 --> 03:41:03.439 align:start position:0%
some people get from other states i've
 
03:41:05.110 --> 03:41:05.120 align:start position:0%
heard the same thing for mental health
 
03:41:07.349 --> 03:41:07.359 align:start position:0%
professionals having a great deal of
 
03:41:10.309 --> 03:41:10.319 align:start position:0%
trouble getting licenses in this state
 
03:41:12.150 --> 03:41:12.160 align:start position:0%
and we ought to be looking at why is
 
03:41:14.630 --> 03:41:14.640 align:start position:0%
that the case when they're
 
03:41:16.790 --> 03:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
qualified enough to help it to work in
 
03:41:19.189 --> 03:41:19.199 align:start position:0%
vermont or massachusetts
 
03:41:21.269 --> 03:41:21.279 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's not like that those
 
03:41:22.550 --> 03:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
states have
 
03:41:25.110 --> 03:41:25.120 align:start position:0%
extremely different qualifications than
 
03:41:26.309 --> 03:41:26.319 align:start position:0%
we do
 
03:41:28.790 --> 03:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
oh i i'd very much support the effort to
 
03:41:31.110 --> 03:41:31.120 align:start position:0%
try to get a handle on this that this
 
03:41:34.790 --> 03:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
committee has the competency to do
 
03:41:36.710 --> 03:41:36.720 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
03:41:39.910 --> 03:41:39.920 align:start position:0%
all right um
 
03:41:41.670 --> 03:41:41.680 align:start position:0%
i was hoping that some of these bills
 
03:41:44.070 --> 03:41:44.080 align:start position:0%
might be easy
 
03:41:46.229 --> 03:41:46.239 align:start position:0%
i agree with you i i think there are two
 
03:41:48.710 --> 03:41:48.720 align:start position:0%
that we might look at okay
 
03:41:51.349 --> 03:41:51.359 align:start position:0%
which ones are those
 
03:41:54.469 --> 03:41:54.479 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking house bill 228 on the
 
03:41:56.550 --> 03:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
physician's assistants and
 
03:41:59.269 --> 03:41:59.279 align:start position:0%
house sorry sorry sorry senate bill
 
03:42:03.830 --> 03:42:03.840 align:start position:0%
228 and senate bill 284 on glaucoma
 
03:42:05.990 --> 03:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
okay do you wish to make a motion on
 
03:42:07.429 --> 03:42:07.439 align:start position:0%
either of them
 
03:42:10.870 --> 03:42:10.880 align:start position:0%
i would love to okay
 
03:42:13.349 --> 03:42:13.359 align:start position:0%
um i would move on to pass on senate
 
03:42:15.269 --> 03:42:15.279 align:start position:0%
bill 284.
 
03:42:18.389 --> 03:42:18.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:21.670 --> 03:42:21.680 align:start position:0%
okay so that's by grota and seconded by
 
03:42:23.429 --> 03:42:23.439 align:start position:0%
marsh do you wish to speak to your
 
03:42:23.439 --> 03:42:25.670 align:start position:0%
marsh do you wish to speak to your
motion

03:42:25.670 --> 03:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
motion
 
03:42:27.349 --> 03:42:27.359 align:start position:0%
excuse me i think the testimony that we
 
03:42:29.830 --> 03:42:29.840 align:start position:0%
heard on the senate bill confirmed that
 
03:42:31.910 --> 03:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
it is a sensible
 
03:42:33.590 --> 03:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
and practical thing to do for the
 
03:42:36.830 --> 03:42:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:39.349 --> 03:42:39.359 align:start position:0%
hampshire thank you
 
03:42:41.269 --> 03:42:41.279 align:start position:0%
the only thing i would add to that is
 
03:42:42.469 --> 03:42:42.479 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
03:42:44.790 --> 03:42:44.800 align:start position:0%
the current statute uh creates a
 
03:42:47.910 --> 03:42:47.920 align:start position:0%
situation where there's an incentive
 
03:42:50.389 --> 03:42:50.399 align:start position:0%
both to take care of the patients and on
 
03:42:52.309 --> 03:42:52.319 align:start position:0%
the part of the doctors to actually
 
03:42:54.389 --> 03:42:54.399 align:start position:0%
misdiagnose certain kinds of glaucoma
 
03:42:56.309 --> 03:42:56.319 align:start position:0%
such as pseudo exfoliative glaucoma
 
03:42:58.070 --> 03:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
which is very uncommon just so they can
 
03:43:00.630 --> 03:43:00.640 align:start position:0%
actually take care of the patients so to
 
03:43:03.110 --> 03:43:03.120 align:start position:0%
align our statutes with current practice
 
03:43:06.469 --> 03:43:06.479 align:start position:0%
makes good sense to me
 
03:43:06.479 --> 03:43:07.830 align:start position:0%
makes good sense to me
okay

03:43:07.830 --> 03:43:07.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:43:10.070 --> 03:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
thank you does anyone else represent
 
03:43:12.469 --> 03:43:12.479 align:start position:0%
goalie and then fellows
 
03:43:14.309 --> 03:43:14.319 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair very briefly i'm
 
03:43:16.790 --> 03:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
just amazed that it took 20 years to get
 
03:43:19.670 --> 03:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
this forward to change into statute what
 
03:43:22.870 --> 03:43:22.880 align:start position:0%
should have been changed a long time ago
 
03:43:24.229 --> 03:43:24.239 align:start position:0%
thank you for that representative
 
03:43:24.239 --> 03:43:25.189 align:start position:0%
thank you for that representative
fellows

03:43:25.189 --> 03:43:25.199 align:start position:0%
fellows
 
03:43:27.990 --> 03:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
so this is just a technical issue but on
 
03:43:29.830 --> 03:43:29.840 align:start position:0%
page 2
 
03:43:31.990 --> 03:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
line 21
 
03:43:35.030 --> 03:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm wondering if um so that starts
 
03:43:37.349 --> 03:43:37.359 align:start position:0%
with roman numeral four
 
03:43:40.229 --> 03:43:40.239 align:start position:0%
which says upon certification to
 
03:43:42.870 --> 03:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
treat glaucoma patients i'm wondering if
 
03:43:45.189 --> 03:43:45.199 align:start position:0%
that title is not applicable anymore
 
03:43:47.670 --> 03:43:47.680 align:start position:0%
it's really more something like when
 
03:43:47.680 --> 03:43:49.429 align:start position:0%
it's really more something like when
consultation

03:43:49.429 --> 03:43:49.439 align:start position:0%
consultation
 
03:43:50.950 --> 03:43:50.960 align:start position:0%
is required
 
03:43:53.030 --> 03:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
it's you know just it's like the title
 
03:43:55.510 --> 03:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
is not but i'm not sure because i don't
 
03:43:55.520 --> 03:43:56.870 align:start position:0%
is not but i'm not sure because i don't
know

03:43:56.870 --> 03:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
know
 
03:43:59.110 --> 03:43:59.120 align:start position:0%
the there's a and
 
03:43:59.120 --> 03:44:00.229 align:start position:0%
the there's a and
b

03:44:00.229 --> 03:44:00.239 align:start position:0%
b
 
03:44:01.990 --> 03:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
right what they're really doing under
 
03:44:03.830 --> 03:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
that that what they're really doing is
 
03:44:07.590 --> 03:44:07.600 align:start position:0%
deleting 4a which is the for 24 months
 
03:44:09.269 --> 03:44:09.279 align:start position:0%
you shall consult
 
03:44:12.070 --> 03:44:12.080 align:start position:0%
and simply saying that
 
03:44:14.309 --> 03:44:14.319 align:start position:0%
an optometrist shall consult with an
 
03:44:16.870 --> 03:44:16.880 align:start position:0%
ophthalmologist when either of these two
 
03:44:19.189 --> 03:44:19.199 align:start position:0%
things occur which look to me as though
 
03:44:19.199 --> 03:44:20.630 align:start position:0%
things occur which look to me as though
they're

03:44:20.630 --> 03:44:20.640 align:start position:0%
they're
 
03:44:22.870 --> 03:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
complications that you want to you want
 
03:44:25.030 --> 03:44:25.040 align:start position:0%
definitely a second opinion right and if
 
03:44:27.110 --> 03:44:27.120 align:start position:0%
that's the whole
 
03:44:29.990 --> 03:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
part if that's the whole of roman
 
03:44:32.469 --> 03:44:32.479 align:start position:0%
numeral four
 
03:44:35.269 --> 03:44:35.279 align:start position:0%
then i don't think the title of a pawn
 
03:44:38.150 --> 03:44:38.160 align:start position:0%
certification to treat glaucoma patients
 
03:44:41.269 --> 03:44:41.279 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to be it's it is actually
 
03:44:41.279 --> 03:44:42.389 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to be it's it is actually
the

03:44:42.389 --> 03:44:42.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:44:42.399 --> 03:44:43.990 align:start position:0%
the
um

03:44:43.990 --> 03:44:44.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:44:44.000 --> 03:44:45.030 align:start position:0%
um
up

03:44:45.030 --> 03:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
up
 
03:44:47.590 --> 03:44:47.600 align:start position:0%
on page one there's a couple of places
 
03:44:48.870 --> 03:44:48.880 align:start position:0%
they said
 
03:44:50.469 --> 03:44:50.479 align:start position:0%
they talk about the requirements for
 
03:44:53.590 --> 03:44:53.600 align:start position:0%
getting certified to treat glaucoma
 
03:44:53.600 --> 03:44:56.710 align:start position:0%
getting certified to treat glaucoma
and

03:44:56.710 --> 03:44:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:59.750 --> 03:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
which are is not an automatic part of
 
03:44:59.760 --> 03:45:03.110 align:start position:0%
which are is not an automatic part of
optometry

03:45:03.110 --> 03:45:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:05.349 --> 03:45:05.359 align:start position:0%
i i thought we're making it kind of like
 
03:45:05.359 --> 03:45:06.870 align:start position:0%
i i thought we're making it kind of like
an

03:45:06.870 --> 03:45:06.880 align:start position:0%
an
 
03:45:09.349 --> 03:45:09.359 align:start position:0%
automatic part of that's what the whole
 
03:45:11.349 --> 03:45:11.359 align:start position:0%
bill does
 
03:45:13.510 --> 03:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
yes but we didn't we didn't or they
 
03:45:16.630 --> 03:45:16.640 align:start position:0%
didn't do it thoroughly they kept the
 
03:45:18.790 --> 03:45:18.800 align:start position:0%
requirement for certification
 
03:45:21.750 --> 03:45:21.760 align:start position:0%
it's an all of page one is about that
 
03:45:24.790 --> 03:45:24.800 align:start position:0%
and so this just says once you've passed
 
03:45:27.590 --> 03:45:27.600 align:start position:0%
those hurdles by graduating
 
03:45:29.750 --> 03:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
recently or went out whatever well
 
03:45:31.429 --> 03:45:31.439 align:start position:0%
that's that's what you do if you if you
 
03:45:34.229 --> 03:45:34.239 align:start position:0%
think that that that that fits it just
 
03:45:36.710 --> 03:45:36.720 align:start position:0%
it looks like a connection for me
 
03:45:38.309 --> 03:45:38.319 align:start position:0%
i think it's wrong okay
 
03:45:40.630 --> 03:45:40.640 align:start position:0%
any any other comments or questions
 
03:45:42.550 --> 03:45:42.560 align:start position:0%
representative allegro
 
03:45:44.469 --> 03:45:44.479 align:start position:0%
well i was frantically digging through
 
03:45:46.550 --> 03:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
my stack of papers did anybody bring up
 
03:45:49.030 --> 03:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
the subject of removing that date of
 
03:45:50.710 --> 03:45:50.720 align:start position:0%
whatever it was 2001 to that as an
 
03:45:50.720 --> 03:45:52.389 align:start position:0%
whatever it was 2001 to that as an
amendment

03:45:52.389 --> 03:45:52.399 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
03:45:54.630 --> 03:45:54.640 align:start position:0%
i mean everybody seemed everybody seemed
 
03:45:56.309 --> 03:45:56.319 align:start position:0%
to um
 
03:45:57.189 --> 03:45:57.199 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:45:59.510 --> 03:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
it raised eyebrows so i was wondering if
 
03:46:01.429 --> 03:46:01.439 align:start position:0%
we're going to do anything about it
 
03:46:05.670 --> 03:46:05.680 align:start position:0%
if i may care yes i just um
 
03:46:07.429 --> 03:46:07.439 align:start position:0%
with the gist of what i got from them
 
03:46:09.590 --> 03:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
was that with the other changes that are
 
03:46:11.990 --> 03:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
involved it just really doesn't matter
 
03:46:12.000 --> 03:46:13.830 align:start position:0%
involved it just really doesn't matter
so

03:46:13.830 --> 03:46:13.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:46:13.840 --> 03:46:15.590 align:start position:0%
so
if

03:46:15.590 --> 03:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
if
 
03:46:17.349 --> 03:46:17.359 align:start position:0%
if we can if we can get send this
 
03:46:19.269 --> 03:46:19.279 align:start position:0%
through as it sits without without
 
03:46:20.790 --> 03:46:20.800 align:start position:0%
touching it
 
03:46:23.110 --> 03:46:23.120 align:start position:0%
and it works then we don't have to deal
 
03:46:25.990 --> 03:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
with the senate having to concur
 
03:46:26.000 --> 03:46:27.030 align:start position:0%
with the senate having to concur
and

03:46:27.030 --> 03:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:46:28.469 --> 03:46:28.479 align:start position:0%
all of that i mean
 
03:46:30.070 --> 03:46:30.080 align:start position:0%
because i because i asked that exact
 
03:46:32.150 --> 03:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
question what what's up with the 2002
 
03:46:34.550 --> 03:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
date but they did it's not just a date
 
03:46:36.790 --> 03:46:36.800 align:start position:0%
it's down until on line 24 it has all
 
03:46:39.110 --> 03:46:39.120 align:start position:0%
that nonsense about how she that she was
 
03:46:41.189 --> 03:46:41.199 align:start position:0%
describing how difficult it was to find
 
03:46:43.110 --> 03:46:43.120 align:start position:0%
the 25 patients because everybody kept
 
03:46:45.990 --> 03:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
moving or retiring or that's also in
 
03:46:49.590 --> 03:46:49.600 align:start position:0%
there yeah that but the waiver
 
03:46:52.710 --> 03:46:52.720 align:start position:0%
yes and the striking out on lines 22 and
 
03:46:52.720 --> 03:46:54.309 align:start position:0%
yes and the striking out on lines 22 and
23

03:46:54.309 --> 03:46:54.319 align:start position:0%
23
 
03:46:56.790 --> 03:46:56.800 align:start position:0%
now make that
 
03:47:01.429 --> 03:47:01.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:05.189 --> 03:47:05.199 align:start position:0%
the thing is that that's if we were to
 
03:47:07.349 --> 03:47:07.359 align:start position:0%
start changing that we would have to
 
03:47:09.910 --> 03:47:09.920 align:start position:0%
change a whole lot of their
 
03:47:13.110 --> 03:47:13.120 align:start position:0%
of their statute and if you wish to take
 
03:47:15.110 --> 03:47:15.120 align:start position:0%
that on as a project
 
03:47:17.510 --> 03:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
more power to you but
 
03:47:19.510 --> 03:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
we'll next year will we then be saying
 
03:47:22.469 --> 03:47:22.479 align:start position:0%
it's been 21 years then
 
03:47:24.229 --> 03:47:24.239 align:start position:0%
yeah like we're now saying it's been 20
 
03:47:26.870 --> 03:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
years and why no this eliminates most of
 
03:47:26.880 --> 03:47:27.910 align:start position:0%
years and why no this eliminates most of
the

03:47:27.910 --> 03:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:47:30.469 --> 03:47:30.479 align:start position:0%
the restrictions
 
03:47:32.950 --> 03:47:32.960 align:start position:0%
for the
 
03:47:38.710 --> 03:47:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:40.710 --> 03:47:40.720 align:start position:0%
i think i'm with representative pearson
 
03:47:42.389 --> 03:47:42.399 align:start position:0%
in that you either have to completely
 
03:47:44.550 --> 03:47:44.560 align:start position:0%
rewrite the spill in the large portion
 
03:47:48.229 --> 03:47:48.239 align:start position:0%
of their statute or you live with some
 
03:47:50.469 --> 03:47:50.479 align:start position:0%
bad line some some language you don't
 
03:47:51.910 --> 03:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
exactly like
 
03:47:54.309 --> 03:47:54.319 align:start position:0%
representative slakis yeah i'd say i
 
03:47:55.510 --> 03:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
mean it
 
03:47:57.189 --> 03:47:57.199 align:start position:0%
it makes sense making that change but
 
03:47:58.469 --> 03:47:58.479 align:start position:0%
maybe you could take that on as a
 
03:48:04.389 --> 03:48:04.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:06.070 --> 03:48:06.080 align:start position:0%
yes the other thing too that sometimes
 
03:48:08.229 --> 03:48:08.239 align:start position:0%
we get lost in with this of course is
 
03:48:10.710 --> 03:48:10.720 align:start position:0%
when you're changing
 
03:48:12.790 --> 03:48:12.800 align:start position:0%
a portion of a statute what what comes
 
03:48:14.630 --> 03:48:14.640 align:start position:0%
out in front of us is the applicable
 
03:48:16.950 --> 03:48:16.960 align:start position:0%
part it's not the holistic part
 
03:48:19.189 --> 03:48:19.199 align:start position:0%
right so there's unless you look at the
 
03:48:21.189 --> 03:48:21.199 align:start position:0%
entire section of law not just the part
 
03:48:23.750 --> 03:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
that's changed to make a change in this
 
03:48:25.510 --> 03:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
that is referenced in other parts that
 
03:48:27.510 --> 03:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
isn't in front of us has a potentially
 
03:48:29.750 --> 03:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
cascading effect and a contradictory
 
03:48:29.760 --> 03:48:30.710 align:start position:0%
cascading effect and a contradictory
effect

03:48:30.710 --> 03:48:30.720 align:start position:0%
effect
 
03:48:32.469 --> 03:48:32.479 align:start position:0%
and that's certainly something that we
 
03:48:33.910 --> 03:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
don't we certainly don't want to do
 
03:48:36.469 --> 03:48:36.479 align:start position:0%
because it will make things worse
 
03:48:36.479 --> 03:48:37.189 align:start position:0%
because it will make things worse
and

03:48:37.189 --> 03:48:37.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:48:39.990 --> 03:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
where we would have to if
 
03:48:41.670 --> 03:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
something that seems logical as simple
 
03:48:43.910 --> 03:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
as removing the 2002 date if that has to
 
03:48:46.070 --> 03:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
go back downstairs the lawyers have to
 
03:48:47.750 --> 03:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
go through it they have to look for
 
03:48:50.469 --> 03:48:50.479 align:start position:0%
conflicts if if the folks that testified
 
03:48:52.550 --> 03:48:52.560 align:start position:0%
seem happy that it's made that date
 
03:48:52.560 --> 03:48:54.710 align:start position:0%
seem happy that it's made that date
irrelevant

03:48:54.710 --> 03:48:54.720 align:start position:0%
irrelevant
 
03:48:56.070 --> 03:48:56.080 align:start position:0%
i just think that that's a you know
 
03:48:58.309 --> 03:48:58.319 align:start position:0%
you're opening the can there that
 
03:49:00.710 --> 03:49:00.720 align:start position:0%
it's going to send us down a road that
 
03:49:01.990 --> 03:49:02.000 align:start position:0%
isn't necessarily going to help the
 
03:49:05.030 --> 03:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
folks out that were here today
 
03:49:07.830 --> 03:49:07.840 align:start position:0%
thank you okay representative like
 
03:49:10.150 --> 03:49:10.160 align:start position:0%
us yeah i'm on board with that too that
 
03:49:11.670 --> 03:49:11.680 align:start position:0%
none of the proponents of the bill seem
 
03:49:13.510 --> 03:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
to be advocating
 
03:49:15.349 --> 03:49:15.359 align:start position:0%
for that change
 
03:49:15.359 --> 03:49:16.150 align:start position:0%
for that change
um

03:49:16.150 --> 03:49:16.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:49:18.469 --> 03:49:18.479 align:start position:0%
and plus what you two have pointed out
 
03:49:23.110 --> 03:49:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:24.630 --> 03:49:24.640 align:start position:0%
i cover everything it's just to say
 
03:49:26.630 --> 03:49:26.640 align:start position:0%
again that trying to
 
03:49:28.070 --> 03:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
make those potentially complicated
 
03:49:30.150 --> 03:49:30.160 align:start position:0%
changes at the last minute is probably
 
03:49:32.630 --> 03:49:32.640 align:start position:0%
not a good idea okay representative
 
03:49:34.630 --> 03:49:34.640 align:start position:0%
goldie and then marsh
 
03:49:36.229 --> 03:49:36.239 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and i agree with
 
03:49:38.309 --> 03:49:38.319 align:start position:0%
all that's been said i spoke to those
 
03:49:40.630 --> 03:49:40.640 align:start position:0%
individuals out in the hallway and i
 
03:49:42.389 --> 03:49:42.399 align:start position:0%
spoke with curtis berry out there and
 
03:49:44.309 --> 03:49:44.319 align:start position:0%
they are comfortable with what's here
 
03:49:46.389 --> 03:49:46.399 align:start position:0%
because i specifically asked if we
 
03:49:48.950 --> 03:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
needed to amend anything and with what
 
03:49:50.469 --> 03:49:50.479 align:start position:0%
they've worked on they are very
 
03:49:51.750 --> 03:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
comfortable with what we have in front
 
03:49:54.070 --> 03:49:54.080 align:start position:0%
of us to do what they want
 
03:49:55.910 --> 03:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
so i'm happy with that and i'm going to
 
03:49:57.750 --> 03:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
support this as is
 
03:50:00.070 --> 03:50:00.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative marsh yes i
 
03:50:01.349 --> 03:50:01.359 align:start position:0%
would just want to concur that i don't
 
03:50:03.030 --> 03:50:03.040 align:start position:0%
want to upset the apple cart i also want
 
03:50:05.189 --> 03:50:05.199 align:start position:0%
to point out that as somebody who has
 
03:50:07.750 --> 03:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
been a hospital trustee for years we
 
03:50:10.469 --> 03:50:10.479 align:start position:0%
notice that many people like to move to
 
03:50:12.309 --> 03:50:12.319 align:start position:0%
the lakes region of new hampshire and
 
03:50:14.710 --> 03:50:14.720 align:start position:0%
retire including some people who are no
 
03:50:16.550 --> 03:50:16.560 align:start position:0%
longer considered competent to practice
 
03:50:18.229 --> 03:50:18.239 align:start position:0%
their profession in the area from which
 
03:50:19.269 --> 03:50:19.279 align:start position:0%
they come
 
03:50:22.309 --> 03:50:22.319 align:start position:0%
so there's some advantage to keeping the
 
03:50:24.710 --> 03:50:24.720 align:start position:0%
date in there even if there's no longer
 
03:50:26.229 --> 03:50:26.239 align:start position:0%
anybody in new hampshire right now that
 
03:50:28.070 --> 03:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
that would cover because it might cover
 
03:50:31.429 --> 03:50:31.439 align:start position:0%
people who might very well move here
 
03:50:33.670 --> 03:50:33.680 align:start position:0%
interesting concept
 
03:50:41.110 --> 03:50:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:42.950 --> 03:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
03:50:46.229 --> 03:50:46.239 align:start position:0%
i heard an old saying a while back and i
 
03:50:48.389 --> 03:50:48.399 align:start position:0%
like it it's don't let the perfect be
 
03:50:51.590 --> 03:50:51.600 align:start position:0%
the enemy of don't let the good no damn
 
03:50:55.189 --> 03:50:55.199 align:start position:0%
it the perfect be the enemy of the god
 
03:50:57.030 --> 03:50:57.040 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for
 
03:50:59.269 --> 03:50:59.279 align:start position:0%
keeping us in line
 
03:51:01.830 --> 03:51:01.840 align:start position:0%
all right anyone else have a comment
 
03:51:01.840 --> 03:51:03.269 align:start position:0%
all right anyone else have a comment

all right
 
03:51:06.389 --> 03:51:06.399 align:start position:0%
in that case the motion is ought to pass
 
03:51:08.790 --> 03:51:08.800 align:start position:0%
made by representative grota seconded by
 
03:51:11.269 --> 03:51:11.279 align:start position:0%

03:52:49.040 --> 03:52:50.870 align:start position:0%
all the all the interested parties
um

03:52:50.870 --> 03:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:52:53.030 --> 03:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
it currently reflects how physician
 
03:52:54.550 --> 03:52:54.560 align:start position:0%
assistants work
 
03:52:57.189 --> 03:52:57.199 align:start position:0%
and puts into puts their rule making
 
03:52:58.870 --> 03:52:58.880 align:start position:0%
into statute
 
03:53:00.630 --> 03:53:00.640 align:start position:0%
so i think that this is a bill that we
 
03:53:01.990 --> 03:53:02.000 align:start position:0%
can certainly pass through this
 
03:53:04.550 --> 03:53:04.560 align:start position:0%
committee to the house
 
03:53:06.550 --> 03:53:06.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative marsh yes i
 
03:53:08.950 --> 03:53:08.960 align:start position:0%
think this is true it's also important
 
03:53:11.269 --> 03:53:11.279 align:start position:0%
that we do our best to
 
03:53:14.870 --> 03:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
support the primary care
 
03:53:16.229 --> 03:53:16.239 align:start position:0%
practitioners in the state of new
 
03:53:17.750 --> 03:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire we know that a great many
 
03:53:19.510 --> 03:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
primary care practitioners have now
 
03:53:21.030 --> 03:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
announced they intend to retire after
 
03:53:23.590 --> 03:53:23.600 align:start position:0%
covet and we could easily be facing a
 
03:53:25.590 --> 03:53:25.600 align:start position:0%
shortage so making it easier for
 
03:53:27.189 --> 03:53:27.199 align:start position:0%
physicians assistants to take on that
 
03:53:30.150 --> 03:53:30.160 align:start position:0%
role is a very good thing
 
03:53:30.160 --> 03:53:31.910 align:start position:0%
role is a very good thing
okay

03:53:31.910 --> 03:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:53:34.070 --> 03:53:34.080 align:start position:0%
does anyone else have a comment
 
03:53:36.389 --> 03:53:36.399 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
03:53:40.070 --> 03:53:40.080 align:start position:0%
goalie and then uh judy
 
03:53:41.910 --> 03:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and i too will
 
03:53:44.309 --> 03:53:44.319 align:start position:0%
support this um
 
03:53:44.319 --> 03:53:46.710 align:start position:0%
support this um
and

03:53:46.710 --> 03:53:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:48.950 --> 03:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
i think it was a good idea to put in the
 
03:53:50.870 --> 03:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
uh part that they had the insurance
 
03:53:52.950 --> 03:53:52.960 align:start position:0%
clause in there because upon you know
 
03:53:55.429 --> 03:53:55.439 align:start position:0%
reading through the bill on page 3 line
 
03:53:55.439 --> 03:53:56.469 align:start position:0%
reading through the bill on page 3 line
16

03:53:56.469 --> 03:53:56.479 align:start position:0%
16
 
03:53:58.550 --> 03:53:58.560 align:start position:0%
in the event unanticipated availability
 
03:54:00.710 --> 03:54:00.720 align:start position:0%
of a participating physician practicing
 
03:54:02.469 --> 03:54:02.479 align:start position:0%
as sole practitioner due to a serious
 
03:54:05.590 --> 03:54:05.600 align:start position:0%
illness or death if his assistant may
 
03:54:07.590 --> 03:54:07.600 align:start position:0%
continue to practice for not more than
 
03:54:09.670 --> 03:54:09.680 align:start position:0%
30-day period without entering into a
 
03:54:12.150 --> 03:54:12.160 align:start position:0%
new collaborative agreement so that says
 
03:54:14.389 --> 03:54:14.399 align:start position:0%
they're practicing on their own without
 
03:54:17.189 --> 03:54:17.199 align:start position:0%
the physician and it is a good thing
 
03:54:18.790 --> 03:54:18.800 align:start position:0%
that we have them insured during that
 
03:54:22.150 --> 03:54:22.160 align:start position:0%
time thank you thank you
 
03:54:24.229 --> 03:54:24.239 align:start position:0%
remember i'm judy yes thank you madam
 
03:54:24.239 --> 03:54:25.030 align:start position:0%
remember i'm judy yes thank you madam
chair

03:54:25.030 --> 03:54:25.040 align:start position:0%
chair
 
03:54:25.040 --> 03:54:26.309 align:start position:0%
chair
um

03:54:26.309 --> 03:54:26.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:54:31.429 --> 03:54:31.439 align:start position:0%
before i support the bill or before
 
03:54:33.189 --> 03:54:33.199 align:start position:0%
i would like to know
 
03:54:35.750 --> 03:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
if the physician
 
03:54:39.510 --> 03:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:42.389 --> 03:54:42.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:45.510 --> 03:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
the assistant physician
 
03:54:48.710 --> 03:54:48.720 align:start position:0%
so if the parents sued
 
03:54:50.950 --> 03:54:50.960 align:start position:0%
the physician
 
03:54:53.510 --> 03:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
also they're going to sue
 
03:54:57.269 --> 03:54:57.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:00.790 --> 03:55:00.800 align:start position:0%
i think that depends on the case
 
03:55:03.349 --> 03:55:03.359 align:start position:0%
they they'll if they sue the
 
03:55:06.150 --> 03:55:06.160 align:start position:0%
position physician's assistant
 
03:55:07.990 --> 03:55:08.000 align:start position:0%
they will probably also sue the
 
03:55:10.389 --> 03:55:10.399 align:start position:0%
physician unless
 
03:55:13.990 --> 03:55:14.000 align:start position:0%
unless it's one of these cases where the
 
03:55:15.510 --> 03:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
doctor was not involved in that
 
03:55:18.790 --> 03:55:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:20.389 --> 03:55:20.399 align:start position:0%
representative grota
 
03:55:22.870 --> 03:55:22.880 align:start position:0%
i also would like to remind my colleague
 
03:55:25.030 --> 03:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire is not a punitive
 
03:55:27.990 --> 03:55:28.000 align:start position:0%
damage state and therefore
 
03:55:30.790 --> 03:55:30.800 align:start position:0%
these cases are carefully
 
03:55:32.950 --> 03:55:32.960 align:start position:0%
reviewed before an attorney takes them
 
03:55:32.960 --> 03:55:33.990 align:start position:0%
reviewed before an attorney takes them
on

03:55:33.990 --> 03:55:34.000 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:55:35.030 --> 03:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:55:38.229 --> 03:55:38.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:40.070 --> 03:55:40.080 align:start position:0%
or some psychic now that all the
 
03:55:42.469 --> 03:55:42.479 align:start position:0%
substantive comments have been made i'm
 
03:55:44.790 --> 03:55:44.800 align:start position:0%
not going to risk an old saying
 
03:55:47.429 --> 03:55:47.439 align:start position:0%
the reason i've been so dyspeptic about
 
03:55:47.439 --> 03:55:48.229 align:start position:0%
the reason i've been so dyspeptic about
the

03:55:48.229 --> 03:55:48.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:55:51.110 --> 03:55:51.120 align:start position:0%
issue of liability is
 
03:55:53.110 --> 03:55:53.120 align:start position:0%
they can say what they want
 
03:55:56.150 --> 03:55:56.160 align:start position:0%
but i'm i've never forgotten the case of
 
03:55:58.870 --> 03:55:58.880 align:start position:0%
a rhoda of a nightclub burning down in
 
03:56:01.510 --> 03:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
rhode island and the radio station
 
03:56:04.150 --> 03:56:04.160 align:start position:0%
that's put on the ads was successfully
 
03:56:04.160 --> 03:56:05.590 align:start position:0%
that's put on the ads was successfully
sued

03:56:05.590 --> 03:56:05.600 align:start position:0%
sued
 
03:56:07.110 --> 03:56:07.120 align:start position:0%
now maybe they weren't protected by
 
03:56:08.950 --> 03:56:08.960 align:start position:0%
statute but
 
03:56:08.960 --> 03:56:10.469 align:start position:0%

i

03:56:10.469 --> 03:56:10.479 align:start position:0%

03:56:18.710 --> 03:56:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:21.750 --> 03:56:21.760 align:start position:0%

04:01:16.950 --> 04:01:16.960 align:start position:0%
continues the process of establishing
 
04:01:20.870 --> 04:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
that the oplc has the authority of
 
04:01:24.070 --> 04:01:24.080 align:start position:0%
to set the fees for the licensing boards
 
04:01:25.910 --> 04:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
it deletes the
 
04:01:29.189 --> 04:01:29.199 align:start position:0%
contradictory statements in a number of
 
04:01:29.199 --> 04:01:30.830 align:start position:0%

boards
 
04:01:33.590 --> 04:01:33.600 align:start position:0%
and some of the boards that disagreed
 
04:01:35.750 --> 04:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
strongly with the policy were deleted
 
04:01:38.469 --> 04:01:38.479 align:start position:0%
from the bill in the senate so it's
 
04:01:41.189 --> 04:01:41.199 align:start position:0%
um there was no opposition to the spill
 
04:01:44.309 --> 04:01:44.319 align:start position:0%
as amended by the senate
 
04:01:46.469 --> 04:01:46.479 align:start position:0%
representative rhodes
 
04:01:48.550 --> 04:01:48.560 align:start position:0%
no thank you
 
04:01:50.389 --> 04:01:50.399 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
04:01:53.189 --> 04:01:53.199 align:start position:0%
representative scitec uh in general i'm
 
04:01:56.790 --> 04:01:56.800 align:start position:0%
uneasy about the direction of oplc and
 
04:01:58.550 --> 04:01:58.560 align:start position:0%
when the subcommittee
 
04:02:02.229 --> 04:02:02.239 align:start position:0%
meets to uh that we've established i i
 
04:02:05.429 --> 04:02:05.439 align:start position:0%
would like to participate in particular
 
04:02:07.269 --> 04:02:07.279 align:start position:0%
i think we have a wonderful
 
04:02:11.269 --> 04:02:11.279 align:start position:0%
uh executive director but this idea of
 
04:02:13.349 --> 04:02:13.359 align:start position:0%
in collaboration with
 
04:02:15.590 --> 04:02:15.600 align:start position:0%
i think it should
 
04:02:17.269 --> 04:02:17.279 align:start position:0%
uh this is more for subcommittee stuff
 
04:02:19.510 --> 04:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
it should be under das not a direct
 
04:02:21.110 --> 04:02:21.120 align:start position:0%
report to the governor
 
04:02:21.120 --> 04:02:21.990 align:start position:0%
report to the governor
uh

04:02:21.990 --> 04:02:22.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:02:25.510 --> 04:02:25.520 align:start position:0%
things of that nature uh i want
 
04:02:29.349 --> 04:02:29.359 align:start position:0%
i want a better
 
04:02:32.070 --> 04:02:32.080 align:start position:0%
law or a better structure
 
04:02:35.750 --> 04:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh i this is not any i'm not at all
 
04:02:38.630 --> 04:02:38.640 align:start position:0%
unhappy or casting aspersions on the
 
04:02:40.389 --> 04:02:40.399 align:start position:0%
current executive director i just want
 
04:02:41.670 --> 04:02:41.680 align:start position:0%
to better
 
04:02:43.510 --> 04:02:43.520 align:start position:0%
feel more comfortable about the the
 
04:02:45.750 --> 04:02:45.760 align:start position:0%
whole office and that's that's all i'll
 
04:02:48.070 --> 04:02:48.080 align:start position:0%
say now well this
 
04:02:50.389 --> 04:02:50.399 align:start position:0%
the study committee in senate bill 330
 
04:02:52.389 --> 04:02:52.399 align:start position:0%
looks like they are
 
04:02:56.550 --> 04:02:56.560 align:start position:0%
addressing that issue among others
 
04:02:59.269 --> 04:02:59.279 align:start position:0%
any other comments questions
 
04:03:00.790 --> 04:03:00.800 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt
 
04:03:03.110 --> 04:03:03.120 align:start position:0%
so i i agree with representative
 
04:03:07.189 --> 04:03:07.199 align:start position:0%
scitec's concerns uh and i think that we
 
04:03:08.389 --> 04:03:08.399 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that we're on the
 
04:03:11.189 --> 04:03:11.199 align:start position:0%
record as we are in our executive
 
04:03:14.070 --> 04:03:14.080 align:start position:0%
session here stating that we we want to
 
04:03:15.830 --> 04:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
see the uh
 
04:03:18.229 --> 04:03:18.239 align:start position:0%
the study committee look at this issue
 
04:03:20.790 --> 04:03:20.800 align:start position:0%
because the structure i think is is too
 
04:03:24.389 --> 04:03:24.399 align:start position:0%
loosely goosey and uh and just defective
 
04:03:27.750 --> 04:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
uh in in several respects so i i hope to
 
04:03:29.990 --> 04:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
be uh working with the subcommittee on
 
04:03:30.000 --> 04:03:30.710 align:start position:0%
be uh working with the subcommittee on
this

04:03:30.710 --> 04:03:30.720 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:03:31.990 --> 04:03:32.000 align:start position:0%
study committee
 
04:03:33.030 --> 04:03:33.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:03:34.710 --> 04:03:34.720 align:start position:0%
yes well it is
 
04:03:37.189 --> 04:03:37.199 align:start position:0%
i believe several of us will be because
 
04:03:38.710 --> 04:03:38.720 align:start position:0%
the study committee
 
04:03:41.269 --> 04:03:41.279 align:start position:0%
has three members of the
 
04:03:43.750 --> 04:03:43.760 align:start position:0%
house of representatives at least one
 
04:03:45.510 --> 04:03:45.520 align:start position:0%
from this committee
 
04:03:48.229 --> 04:03:48.239 align:start position:0%
and we might add more if we
 
04:03:50.830 --> 04:03:50.840 align:start position:0%
when we add this scope
 
04:03:54.150 --> 04:03:54.160 align:start position:0%
of looking at the funding
 
04:03:56.710 --> 04:03:56.720 align:start position:0%
from your lips the gods here madam chair
 
04:03:56.720 --> 04:03:57.750 align:start position:0%

04:04:00.309 --> 04:04:00.319 align:start position:0%
any other comments on senate bill 313
 
04:04:02.150 --> 04:04:02.160 align:start position:0%
representative schuett
 
04:04:04.070 --> 04:04:04.080 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
04:04:05.510 --> 04:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
i will add further i think you're
 
04:04:07.590 --> 04:04:07.600 align:start position:0%
probably all aware that
 
04:04:10.229 --> 04:04:10.239 align:start position:0%
chair maguire and i have been working on
 
04:04:15.269 --> 04:04:15.279 align:start position:0%
creating an oversight committee for oplc
 
04:04:15.279 --> 04:04:16.469 align:start position:0%
creating an oversight committee for oplc
somewhat

04:04:16.469 --> 04:04:16.479 align:start position:0%
somewhat
 
04:04:18.469 --> 04:04:18.479 align:start position:0%
similar to the oversight for health and
 
04:04:21.670 --> 04:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
human services to try and
 
04:04:25.189 --> 04:04:25.199 align:start position:0%
have an ongoing way to alleviate some of
 
04:04:27.670 --> 04:04:27.680 align:start position:0%
the friction that we've seen between
 
04:04:30.870 --> 04:04:30.880 align:start position:0%
the administration and the boards so
 
04:04:32.469 --> 04:04:32.479 align:start position:0%
study committee or no i think an
 
04:04:34.630 --> 04:04:34.640 align:start position:0%
oversight committee is is a pretty good
 
04:04:36.469 --> 04:04:36.479 align:start position:0%
indication that
 
04:04:43.110 --> 04:04:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:46.150 --> 04:04:46.160 align:start position:0%
anyone else comments
 
04:04:47.750 --> 04:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
representative seizac i don't want to be
 
04:04:49.269 --> 04:04:49.279 align:start position:0%
wicked but isn't that oversight
 
04:04:53.750 --> 04:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:57.030 --> 04:04:57.040 align:start position:0%
it has to encompass the senate edna also
 
04:04:59.429 --> 04:04:59.439 align:start position:0%
it's it's a mix of
 
04:05:02.870 --> 04:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:07.670 --> 04:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
