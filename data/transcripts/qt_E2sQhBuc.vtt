00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:42.720 align:start position:0%
representative Aaron moves that we adopt
 
00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
the committee across the report chair
 
00:15:58.009 --> 00:15:58.019 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:58.019 --> 00:16:00.290 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:00.300 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
the last time I guess was about a month
 
00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
ago I get up to speak about SB 61
 
00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
I described to all of you what we saw in
 
00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:13.260 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:16:15.889 --> 00:16:15.899 align:start position:0%
and the influence of the industry that
 
00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:18.180 align:start position:0%
made me step by step move to a position
 
00:16:20.329 --> 00:16:20.339 align:start position:0%
where I couldn't support the bill that
 
00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
was as it was written
 
00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:24.660 align:start position:0%
since that time
 
00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
some of you may have seen the article
 
00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:29.160 align:start position:0%
that was in the Concord Monitor
 
00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
this is also in a number of other media
 
00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:33.720 align:start position:0%
Outlets we have received confirmation in
 
00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:36.480 align:start position:0%
the form of emails between
 
00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:40.220 align:start position:0%
lawyer for Casella waste management and
 
00:16:43.189 --> 00:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
officials at DES which have confirmed
 
00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
the suspicions that I and others have
 
00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:48.060 align:start position:0%
had about how directly Casella has
 
00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:51.180 align:start position:0%
shaped this process indeed dictated the
 
00:16:53.449 --> 00:16:53.459 align:start position:0%
terms of the legislation that we are
 
00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:54.540 align:start position:0%
voting on
 
00:16:59.150 --> 00:16:59.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
I know this is a very controversial bill
 
00:17:04.189 --> 00:17:04.199 align:start position:0%
but we're not going to allow
 
00:17:04.199 --> 00:17:05.689 align:start position:0%
but we're not going to allow
any

00:17:05.689 --> 00:17:05.699 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
intent to be brought on to anybody
 
00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
whether it be state employees whether it
 
00:17:13.189 --> 00:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
be private people or whether it be a
 
00:17:13.199 --> 00:17:14.270 align:start position:0%
be private people or whether it be a
lobbyist

00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:14.280 align:start position:0%
lobbyist
 
00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:16.079 align:start position:0%
so for all the members that are going to
 
00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:17.640 align:start position:0%
speak on this bill keep that in mind
 
00:17:20.449 --> 00:17:20.459 align:start position:0%
that that's not allowed
 
00:17:22.789 --> 00:17:22.799 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Mr Speaker
 
00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:24.900 align:start position:0%
each of us has a very difficult decision
 
00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:28.020 align:start position:0%
to make today I don't pretend that this
 
00:17:30.409 --> 00:17:30.419 align:start position:0%
is an easy decision to make for anybody
 
00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:32.580 align:start position:0%
on either side of the aisle
 
00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:35.580 align:start position:0%
what I want to say today is that whether
 
00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:38.460 align:start position:0%
you vote in favor of the committee of
 
00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:41.640 align:start position:0%
conference report or you vote against it
 
00:17:43.789 --> 00:17:43.799 align:start position:0%
we have to think about what our
 
00:17:47.029 --> 00:17:47.039 align:start position:0%
responsibilities are going forward if
 
00:17:49.549 --> 00:17:49.559 align:start position:0%
you vote in favor of this amendment or
 
00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:52.740 align:start position:0%
pardon me the the report and the bill it
 
00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:54.240 align:start position:0%
has a two-year obeyance and that
 
00:17:56.210 --> 00:17:56.220 align:start position:0%
two-year abeyance is not nothing I
 
00:17:57.409 --> 00:17:57.419 align:start position:0%
concede that
 
00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:00.120 align:start position:0%
but it is still our responsibility to
 
00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:02.760 align:start position:0%
exercise all of the oversight
 
00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:05.160 align:start position:0%
that we have been tasked with exercising
 
00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:07.860 align:start position:0%
by the people who sent us here
 
00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
we need to have an oversight Committee
 
00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:12.780 align:start position:0%
in Ena environment agriculture we've
 
00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:14.460 align:start position:0%
talked about that and we need to follow
 
00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:16.380 align:start position:0%
it every step of the line from the
 
00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
report that takes 120 days to the
 
00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
writing of the rule process
 
00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:24.600 align:start position:0%
seeing how much this bill has been
 
00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:26.840 align:start position:0%
crafted by special interests only
 
00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
reinforces how important that oversight
 
00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:31.140 align:start position:0%
responsibility is
 
00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:33.440 align:start position:0%
likewise if you vote against this today
 
00:18:36.409 --> 00:18:36.419 align:start position:0%
the rules will expire in June of next
 
00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:39.660 align:start position:0%
year at that point Des will have to
 
00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
rewrite rules that is their
 
00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
responsibility and it is our
 
00:18:45.529 --> 00:18:45.539 align:start position:0%
responsibility to oversee it with or
 
00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:49.140 align:start position:0%
without SB 61.
 
00:18:51.529 --> 00:18:51.539 align:start position:0%
my concern is by as I have expressed
 
00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:54.900 align:start position:0%
before is that the hiring of a
 
00:18:56.750 --> 00:18:56.760 align:start position:0%
consultant which is favorable to the
 
00:18:59.630 --> 00:18:59.640 align:start position:0%
industry will lead to a writing of rules
 
00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
which is favorable to the industry
 
00:19:05.710 --> 00:19:05.720 align:start position:0%
I was not elected by special interests
 
00:19:09.049 --> 00:19:09.059 align:start position:0%
representing any industry I'm not here
 
00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:12.900 align:start position:0%
to represent the interests of any
 
00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:14.340 align:start position:0%
particular industry I'm here to
 
00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:16.140 align:start position:0%
represent the interests of the people in
 
00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:19.260 align:start position:0%
my districts and in the people of the
 
00:19:21.529 --> 00:19:21.539 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire so whether 61
 
00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
passes or it doesn't pass whatever side
 
00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:28.740 align:start position:0%
you end up voting on what I implore you
 
00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:31.320 align:start position:0%
to do what I implore this house to do is
 
00:19:33.970 --> 00:19:33.980 align:start position:0%
to strenuously to vigorously exercise
 
00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:37.260 align:start position:0%
our oversight responsibilities
 
00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:40.140 align:start position:0%
every step down the line to make sure
 
00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
that the rules we get are a lot better
 
00:19:44.570 --> 00:19:44.580 align:start position:0%
than the bill we got thank you Mr
 
00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:47.990 align:start position:0%
than the bill we got thank you Mr
Speaker

00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:04.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:06.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:08.940 align:start position:0%
I have clearly stated all the reasons SB
 
00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:11.340 align:start position:0%
61 needs to be thrown in the trash pun
 
00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:12.289 align:start position:0%
61 needs to be thrown in the trash pun
intended

00:20:12.289 --> 00:20:12.299 align:start position:0%
intended
 
00:20:15.529 --> 00:20:15.539 align:start position:0%
SB 61 has always been bad for health and
 
00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:17.640 align:start position:0%
the environment not only kicks the can
 
00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:19.380 align:start position:0%
down the road but it kicks it in the
 
00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:20.580 align:start position:0%
wrong direction
 
00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:22.860 align:start position:0%
I'm not here to rehash any of the
 
00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
arguments against it I'm here to present
 
00:20:26.930 --> 00:20:26.940 align:start position:0%
new information we didn't have when we
 
00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:28.570 align:start position:0%
new information we didn't have when we
voted

00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:28.580 align:start position:0%
voted
 
00:20:31.789 --> 00:20:31.799 align:start position:0%
226-152 against my bipartisan floor
 
00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:38.700 align:start position:0%
although there is obvious ethical issues
 
00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:40.380 align:start position:0%
with drafting this legislation
 
00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:42.360 align:start position:0%
throughout the six-month process to get
 
00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
here I am more upset with the fact that
 
00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:47.640 align:start position:0%
this influence and control is blatantly
 
00:20:49.669 --> 00:20:49.679 align:start position:0%
putting the future and health and safety
 
00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:52.440 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire citizens at risk and
 
00:20:54.289 --> 00:20:54.299 align:start position:0%
with all the new information we have
 
00:20:56.750 --> 00:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
leading up to today there shouldn't be
 
00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:00.780 align:start position:0%
one vote in this house to concur SB 61.
 
00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:03.780 align:start position:0%
if you are stuck on the only argument in
 
00:21:06.409 --> 00:21:06.419 align:start position:0%
support of 61 because of a two-year
 
00:21:09.049 --> 00:21:09.059 align:start position:0%
abeyance on landfill permitting while
 
00:21:11.029 --> 00:21:11.039 align:start position:0%
new rules are written here's why that
 
00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
argument doesn't hold water
 
00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
Des has repeated repeatedly said they
 
00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
are already well into writing new
 
00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:18.770 align:start position:0%
are already well into writing new
setback

00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:18.780 align:start position:0%
setback
 
00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:20.520 align:start position:0%
site-specific setback landfill
 
00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:22.260 align:start position:0%
permitting rules because the current
 
00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:25.740 align:start position:0%
rules expire in July of 2024. so this
 
00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
process is well underway
 
00:21:30.169 --> 00:21:30.179 align:start position:0%
this bill is a hundred percent not
 
00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:33.720 align:start position:0%
necessary why would we spend money on a
 
00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
report which only hears from one expert
 
00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:39.720 align:start position:0%
with one point of view versus multiple
 
00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:41.220 align:start position:0%
points of view
 
00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:43.740 align:start position:0%
if Des needs more expertise to complete
 
00:21:46.370 --> 00:21:46.380 align:start position:0%
these rules the legislature can easily
 
00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:49.020 align:start position:0%
provide that by holding a one-day public
 
00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
hearing inviting all the experts to
 
00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:53.700 align:start position:0%
provide all of their information the
 
00:21:56.810 --> 00:21:56.820 align:start position:0%
data the models Etc to be compiled for
 
00:21:59.630 --> 00:21:59.640 align:start position:0%
the agency over the last three years of
 
00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:02.760 align:start position:0%
hearings we have tons of free and
 
00:22:05.210 --> 00:22:05.220 align:start position:0%
readily available information from All
 
00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:07.440 align:start position:0%
Points of View they can utilize to help
 
00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:08.330 align:start position:0%
Points of View they can utilize to help
them

00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:08.340 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:22:10.490 --> 00:22:10.500 align:start position:0%
hey I'll even volunteer to compile it
 
00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:11.960 align:start position:0%
all for them
 
00:22:15.789 --> 00:22:15.799 align:start position:0%
sb61 guarantees a one-sided report
 
00:22:18.289 --> 00:22:18.299 align:start position:0%
favoring the industry
 
00:22:18.299 --> 00:22:19.909 align:start position:0%
favoring the industry
stakeholders

00:22:19.909 --> 00:22:19.919 align:start position:0%
stakeholders
 
00:22:22.490 --> 00:22:22.500 align:start position:0%
why would we ever pay 200k for a
 
00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:25.320 align:start position:0%
one-sided you know information which is
 
00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:28.020 align:start position:0%
already free we know that the industry
 
00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
already has the information in this
 
00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
report that is like easily accessible
 
00:22:34.850 --> 00:22:34.860 align:start position:0%
they could literally just grab it out of
 
00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
a filing cabinet on a top drawer
 
00:22:39.409 --> 00:22:39.419 align:start position:0%
the ENA committee knows this because
 
00:22:40.549 --> 00:22:40.559 align:start position:0%
they have been hearing this information
 
00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:42.360 align:start position:0%
for years now
 
00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
so why is there a rush to pass this bill
 
00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:47.400 align:start position:0%
which removes legislative oversight when
 
00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire doesn't need another
 
00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:50.720 align:start position:0%
landfill for at least 20 to 30 years
 
00:22:53.630 --> 00:22:53.640 align:start position:0%
this body should easily see the agenda
 
00:22:56.029 --> 00:22:56.039 align:start position:0%
here and answer that question
 
00:22:58.130 --> 00:22:58.140 align:start position:0%
shouldn't our Focus next session be on
 
00:23:00.169 --> 00:23:00.179 align:start position:0%
reducing the amount of out-of-state
 
00:23:02.029 --> 00:23:02.039 align:start position:0%
trash we are taking in from States like
 
00:23:02.039 --> 00:23:03.289 align:start position:0%
trash we are taking in from States like
Massachusetts

00:23:03.289 --> 00:23:03.299 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts
 
00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:07.500 align:start position:0%
the other body killed HB 56 with almost
 
00:23:10.190 --> 00:23:10.200 align:start position:0%
no discussion and then insisted on
 
00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
making more changes to their own bill
 
00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:15.240 align:start position:0%
that we concurred with on June 8th
 
00:23:17.210 --> 00:23:17.220 align:start position:0%
that's the only reason we're still here
 
00:23:19.970 --> 00:23:19.980 align:start position:0%
talking about landfills but the changes
 
00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:21.960 align:start position:0%
made the bill even more friendly towards
 
00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
the one company at the heart of this
 
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.130 align:start position:0%
the one company at the heart of this
issue

00:23:25.130 --> 00:23:25.140 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:23:27.529 --> 00:23:27.539 align:start position:0%
the sad part is the bill actually got
 
00:23:29.810 --> 00:23:29.820 align:start position:0%
better for the industry in the committee
 
00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:31.320 align:start position:0%
of conference
 
00:23:33.890 --> 00:23:33.900 align:start position:0%
so between January and June there was a
 
00:23:35.270 --> 00:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
whole strong armed approach from the
 
00:23:37.130 --> 00:23:37.140 align:start position:0%
Senate that they wouldn't take anything
 
00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:39.480 align:start position:0%
from the house and then in the committee
 
00:23:42.169 --> 00:23:42.179 align:start position:0%
of conference they actually changed the
 
00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:44.700 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest statement and it's
 
00:23:46.970 --> 00:23:46.980 align:start position:0%
now worthless it basically talks in
 
00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:48.590 align:start position:0%
now worthless it basically talks in
circles

00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:48.600 align:start position:0%
circles
 
00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
I look forward to my colleagues on the
 
00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:52.440 align:start position:0%
other side who will talk common sense
 
00:23:54.890 --> 00:23:54.900 align:start position:0%
about their traditional core value of
 
00:23:57.310 --> 00:23:57.320 align:start position:0%
protecting the environment while not
 
00:23:59.930 --> 00:23:59.940 align:start position:0%
unduly burdening the industry
 
00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:01.740 align:start position:0%
certainly the two Chambers can come
 
00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:03.960 align:start position:0%
together in January and produce a bill
 
00:24:06.169 --> 00:24:06.179 align:start position:0%
that offers some real protections for
 
00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:08.700 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire surface water until our
 
00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:10.620 align:start position:0%
state can produce a detailed setback
 
00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:13.320 align:start position:0%
rule there is an obvious stop Gap
 
00:24:15.409 --> 00:24:15.419 align:start position:0%
Improvement in the meantime
 
00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:18.900 align:start position:0%
simply Des could change the ridiculous
 
00:24:22.010 --> 00:24:22.020 align:start position:0%
200 foot uniform setback role to one
 
00:24:25.909 --> 00:24:25.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:25.919 --> 00:24:28.730 align:start position:0%
 
basically

00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:28.740 align:start position:0%
basically
 
00:24:30.529 --> 00:24:30.539 align:start position:0%
the Department of Environmental Services
 
00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:33.480 align:start position:0%
will choose a site-specific setback to
 
00:24:36.049 --> 00:24:36.059 align:start position:0%
surface water in every individual permit
 
00:24:39.130 --> 00:24:39.140 align:start position:0%
application from now on based on local
 
00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
hydrogeologic conditions no new bill is
 
00:24:45.289 --> 00:24:45.299 align:start position:0%
needed right now no taxpayer funds need
 
00:24:48.409 --> 00:24:48.419 align:start position:0%
to be sent period end of story
 
00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
when new information arises it's time to
 
00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:53.940 align:start position:0%
change course let's make doing the right
 
00:24:56.570 --> 00:24:56.580 align:start position:0%
thing popular again please vote no to
 
00:24:59.630 --> 00:24:59.640 align:start position:0%
non-concur with SB 61 Mr Speaker I ask
 
00:25:02.149 --> 00:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
for a division vote
 
00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:15.960 align:start position:0%
please I Rise Again to talk about my
 
00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:19.620 align:start position:0%
reservations with this bill
 
00:25:23.029 --> 00:25:23.039 align:start position:0%
as indicated by my esteemed colleague
 
00:25:25.549 --> 00:25:25.559 align:start position:0%
representative germana
 
00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:28.640 align:start position:0%
and my other esteemed colleague
 
00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:31.140 align:start position:0%
representative Potenza
 
00:25:35.149 --> 00:25:35.159 align:start position:0%
there are problems with the process in
 
00:25:39.049 --> 00:25:39.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:42.120 align:start position:0%
the process was entirely weighted on one
 
00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:43.669 align:start position:0%
the process was entirely weighted on one
side

00:25:43.669 --> 00:25:43.679 align:start position:0%
side
 
00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:46.380 align:start position:0%
previously my colleagues had written a
 
00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:50.460 align:start position:0%
good bill HB 56 but the folks on the
 
00:25:51.769 --> 00:25:51.779 align:start position:0%
other side
 
00:25:55.970 --> 00:25:55.980 align:start position:0%
killed the bill and gave us a study bill
 
00:25:59.269 --> 00:25:59.279 align:start position:0%
it never made sense to me
 
00:26:03.169 --> 00:26:03.179 align:start position:0%
now we know why the bill was so weak and
 
00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
the process has gone from bad to worse
 
00:26:10.370 --> 00:26:10.380 align:start position:0%
with the evidence in hand we now see why
 
00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:13.740 align:start position:0%
the bill does not reflect the wishes of
 
00:26:16.669 --> 00:26:16.679 align:start position:0%
the people who will be most affected by
 
00:26:16.679 --> 00:26:17.810 align:start position:0%
the people who will be most affected by
it

00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:17.820 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:26:20.690 --> 00:26:20.700 align:start position:0%
the process was neither Fair nor
 
00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:22.490 align:start position:0%
the process was neither Fair nor
transparent

00:26:22.490 --> 00:26:22.500 align:start position:0%
transparent
 
00:26:24.529 --> 00:26:24.539 align:start position:0%
our committee was told that this bill
 
00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
was not about a particular company
 
00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:30.120 align:start position:0%
or a particular landfill but
 
00:26:33.049 --> 00:26:33.059 align:start position:0%
respectfully evidence has proven to the
 
00:26:33.059 --> 00:26:34.250 align:start position:0%
respectfully evidence has proven to the
contrary

00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:34.260 align:start position:0%
contrary
 
00:26:37.789 --> 00:26:37.799 align:start position:0%
people who will be directly impacted by
 
00:26:39.049 --> 00:26:39.059 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:26:41.930 --> 00:26:41.940 align:start position:0%
do not want the bill
 
00:26:44.330 --> 00:26:44.340 align:start position:0%
and they certainly do not want the
 
00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:46.370 align:start position:0%
and they certainly do not want the
landfill

00:26:46.370 --> 00:26:46.380 align:start position:0%
landfill
 
00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:49.200 align:start position:0%
and they now have no confidence in the
 
00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:51.409 align:start position:0%
and they now have no confidence in the
process

00:26:51.409 --> 00:26:51.419 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:26:55.310 --> 00:26:55.320 align:start position:0%
they are not granted a seat in this Hall
 
00:26:59.269 --> 00:26:59.279 align:start position:0%
we sit here as their representatives if
 
00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
we do not represent their interest who
 
00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:04.730 align:start position:0%
we do not represent their interest who
will

00:27:04.730 --> 00:27:04.740 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:08.220 align:start position:0%
I now know that a bad Bill is really not
 
00:27:10.549 --> 00:27:10.559 align:start position:0%
better than no bill
 
00:27:13.549 --> 00:27:13.559 align:start position:0%
if this bill fails Des will have a year
 
00:27:16.370 --> 00:27:16.380 align:start position:0%
and all the help they need to write a
 
00:27:18.769 --> 00:27:18.779 align:start position:0%
better rule that is currently on the
 
00:27:18.779 --> 00:27:19.789 align:start position:0%
better rule that is currently on the
books

00:27:19.789 --> 00:27:19.799 align:start position:0%
books
 
00:27:22.610 --> 00:27:22.620 align:start position:0%
and there are qualified scientists and
 
00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:25.140 align:start position:0%
professionals with all the knowledge to
 
00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:28.200 align:start position:0%
assist them for far less than two
 
00:27:30.169 --> 00:27:30.179 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars
 
00:27:33.169 --> 00:27:33.179 align:start position:0%
meanwhile we will be watching going
 
00:27:35.450 --> 00:27:35.460 align:start position:0%
forward we must do better than this
 
00:27:39.169 --> 00:27:39.179 align:start position:0%
flawed process our natural resources are
 
00:27:42.169 --> 00:27:42.179 align:start position:0%
the reason that so many people want to
 
00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:43.740 align:start position:0%
live in New Hampshire
 
00:27:46.430 --> 00:27:46.440 align:start position:0%
or come visit our state
 
00:27:52.250 --> 00:27:52.260 align:start position:0%
only a fool seeks to foul his own nest
 
00:27:54.529 --> 00:27:54.539 align:start position:0%
if it's true that the measure of a man
 
00:27:57.169 --> 00:27:57.179 align:start position:0%
or a woman is what they do with power
 
00:28:00.169 --> 00:28:00.179 align:start position:0%
let it be said that in advocating for
 
00:28:02.450 --> 00:28:02.460 align:start position:0%
the rights of those who will bear the
 
00:28:05.049 --> 00:28:05.059 align:start position:0%
burdens of the decisions we make here
 
00:28:09.049 --> 00:28:09.059 align:start position:0%
they or foremost in our thoughts as we
 
00:28:12.409 --> 00:28:12.419 align:start position:0%
weigh these decisions in accord with our
 
00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
conscience thank you Mr Speaker
 
00:28:24.289 --> 00:28:24.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:24.299 --> 00:28:25.490 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:28:25.490 --> 00:28:25.500 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:27.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker first of all this
 
00:28:29.149 --> 00:28:29.159 align:start position:0%
is the last day and let me just say
 
00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
thank you to all the representatives who
 
00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
have shown me a freshman with dreadlocks
 
00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:37.080 align:start position:0%
such respect in my first term in the New
 
00:28:38.690 --> 00:28:38.700 align:start position:0%
Hampshire state house this is New
 
00:28:41.149 --> 00:28:41.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and that's why we are here
 
00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
so thank you
 
00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:46.980 align:start position:0%
I rise today in support of non-concur on
 
00:28:49.370 --> 00:28:49.380 align:start position:0%
this legislation because we have water
 
00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
Warriors in the North Country who are
 
00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
begging us to protect their water I rise
 
00:28:56.930 --> 00:28:56.940 align:start position:0%
today because born and raised in New
 
00:28:58.789 --> 00:28:58.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm going to be damned if I'm
 
00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
going to let our water be controlled by
 
00:29:03.049 --> 00:29:03.059 align:start position:0%
an industry which has no
 
00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
qualms whatsoever for destroying our
 
00:29:08.690 --> 00:29:08.700 align:start position:0%
land our environment and our our sea our
 
00:29:10.130 --> 00:29:10.140 align:start position:0%
our Lakes
 
00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:14.820 align:start position:0%
this is not Casella's body we are the
 
00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire House of Representatives
 
00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:19.080 align:start position:0%
we are elected by our constituents and
 
00:29:21.889 --> 00:29:21.899 align:start position:0%
we none of us can go to our constituents
 
00:29:24.169 --> 00:29:24.179 align:start position:0%
after passing a bill such as this and
 
00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
say that we protected our environment
 
00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:31.320 align:start position:0%
there is no rush here the people in the
 
00:29:33.529 --> 00:29:33.539 align:start position:0%
North Country want us to kill this bill
 
00:29:36.049 --> 00:29:36.059 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what we should do listen
 
00:29:39.169 --> 00:29:39.179 align:start position:0%
to my colleague from Keen my colleague
 
00:29:41.029 --> 00:29:41.039 align:start position:0%
who sits behind me and my colleague over
 
00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:43.740 align:start position:0%
there from Manchester join us in
 
00:29:45.970 --> 00:29:45.980 align:start position:0%
standing against Casella against
 
00:29:48.289 --> 00:29:48.299 align:start position:0%
representative representative thank you
 
00:29:49.789 --> 00:29:49.799 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker the representative will
 
00:29:56.090 --> 00:29:56.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:06.289 --> 00:30:06.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
that was quite the speech to follow
 
00:30:11.930 --> 00:30:11.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:13.970 --> 00:30:13.980 align:start position:0%
the bill is amended by the house and I'm
 
00:30:15.470 --> 00:30:15.480 align:start position:0%

for rules to provide adequate protection

we all want to protect

we were put here by our our citizens as
 
00:31:13.070 --> 00:31:13.080 align:start position:0%
the largest legislative body in the U.S

other than Congress

to represent their wishes
 
00:31:20.389 --> 00:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
I would think that everybody in this
 
00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
room wants to do their best to protect
 
00:31:24.889 --> 00:31:24.899 align:start position:0%

not necessarily to worship it but to be
 
00:31:32.029 --> 00:31:32.039 align:start position:0%
good stewards of it so we protect it so
 
00:31:34.909 --> 00:31:34.919 align:start position:0%
we can pass it on to our children I
 
00:31:36.289 --> 00:31:36.299 align:start position:0%
would ask that you would oppose the
 
00:31:37.970 --> 00:31:37.980 align:start position:0%
concar motion
 
00:31:41.450 --> 00:31:41.460 align:start position:0%
and make sure the rules that are adopted
 
00:31:44.510 --> 00:31:44.520 align:start position:0%
go through this body in particular in a
 
00:31:47.930 --> 00:31:47.940 align:start position:0%
way that protects our our water bodies
 
00:31:50.930 --> 00:31:50.940 align:start position:0%

its version we passed two weeks ago
 
00:32:28.510 --> 00:32:28.520 align:start position:0%
with an amendment we correct
 
00:32:31.610 --> 00:32:31.620 align:start position:0%
typographical errors and clarifies the
 
00:32:34.130 --> 00:32:34.140 align:start position:0%
language for the one-time extension of
 
00:32:36.470 --> 00:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
the rulemaking deadline that was the
 
00:32:38.810 --> 00:32:38.820 align:start position:0%
house version
 
00:32:43.370 --> 00:32:43.380 align:start position:0%
this bill directs Des to hire one or
 
00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
more Consultants to examine current laws
 
00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:49.260 align:start position:0%
and rules and recommend updates to those
 
00:32:52.669 --> 00:32:52.679 align:start position:0%
rules that take into consideration a set
 
00:32:56.049 --> 00:32:56.059 align:start position:0%
of technical factors including soil
 
00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
stratigraphy and permeability volume

the commissioner of Des Bob Scott is in
 
00:33:22.909 --> 00:33:22.919 align:start position:0%
favor of this bill
 
00:33:26.509 --> 00:33:26.519 align:start position:0%
currently Des does not have the Manpower
 
00:33:30.649 --> 00:33:30.659 align:start position:0%
or expertise to do this work alone
 
00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:34.440 align:start position:0%
the bill this bill grants Des the help
 
00:33:37.610 --> 00:33:37.620 align:start position:0%
they have requested without incurring
 
00:33:40.730 --> 00:33:40.740 align:start position:0%
the cost of one or more new permanent
 
00:33:42.769 --> 00:33:42.779 align:start position:0%
staff hires
 
00:33:46.610 --> 00:33:46.620 align:start position:0%
third party assistance here makes sense
 
00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
and it will be done through an RFP
 
00:33:51.710 --> 00:33:51.720 align:start position:0%
process that has specific requirements
 
00:33:54.769 --> 00:33:54.779 align:start position:0%
and language preventing any conflict of
 
00:33:58.130 --> 00:33:58.140 align:start position:0%
interest as well additionally there will
 
00:34:00.649 --> 00:34:00.659 align:start position:0%
be points along this rule making process
 
00:34:05.269 --> 00:34:05.279 align:start position:0%
for public scrutiny and public input
 
00:34:08.570 --> 00:34:08.580 align:start position:0%

that is how legislation is normally
 
00:34:24.710 --> 00:34:24.720 align:start position:0%
crafted in our committees and Chambers
 
00:34:27.530 --> 00:34:27.540 align:start position:0%
we all know that nothing isn't done here
 
00:34:29.450 --> 00:34:29.460 align:start position:0%

with a much needed expertise and

assistance to update its current
 
00:34:47.990 --> 00:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:50.520 align:start position:0%
it is very important to note
 
00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
that during the process of establishing
 
00:34:55.970 --> 00:34:55.980 align:start position:0%
new landfill setback rules and E and all
 
00:34:58.070 --> 00:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
landfill permit applications will be
 
00:35:00.650 --> 00:35:00.660 align:start position:0%
held in advance and when the rules are
 
00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:03.720 align:start position:0%
completed within 24 months the permit
 
00:35:06.770 --> 00:35:06.780 align:start position:0%
application must be modified to comply
 
00:35:09.410 --> 00:35:09.420 align:start position:0%
with those new rules
 
00:35:11.690 --> 00:35:11.700 align:start position:0%
if this Committee of conference report
 
00:35:15.470 --> 00:35:15.480 align:start position:0%
is not accepted by you today
 
00:35:18.829 --> 00:35:18.839 align:start position:0%
than any landfill permits can be granted
 
00:35:22.790 --> 00:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
next week or next month this year or
 
00:35:25.609 --> 00:35:25.619 align:start position:0%
next year with the old rules still in
 
00:35:29.329 --> 00:35:29.339 align:start position:0%
place which includes a minimum 200 foot
 
00:35:32.089 --> 00:35:32.099 align:start position:0%
setback from a body of water
 
00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
that is not an acceptable option
 
00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
by accepting this Committee of
 
00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:40.440 align:start position:0%
conference report it will give the
 
00:35:42.890 --> 00:35:42.900 align:start position:0%
landfill permit granting activity a
 
00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
two-year pause with a one-time 90-day
 
00:35:48.770 --> 00:35:48.780 align:start position:0%
extension if necessary
 
00:35:52.609 --> 00:35:52.619 align:start position:0%
and that will happen right away
 
00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:56.640 align:start position:0%
this bill is possible now
 
00:36:00.589 --> 00:36:00.599 align:start position:0%
we can eliminate the current possible
 
00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:03.720 align:start position:0%
to any body of water now
 
00:36:06.770 --> 00:36:06.780 align:start position:0%
and we can give a two-year pause to
 
00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:09.240 align:start position:0%
permitting now
 
00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:11.280 align:start position:0%

while new rules are still being
developed

00:36:12.650 --> 00:36:12.660 align:start position:0%
developed
 
00:36:14.990 --> 00:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
we must not let this important chance
 
00:36:18.829 --> 00:36:18.839 align:start position:0%
slip away and I urge you my colleagues
 
00:36:21.530 --> 00:36:21.540 align:start position:0%
to support and pass this Committee of
 
00:36:25.069 --> 00:36:25.079 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker
 
00:37:58.609 --> 00:37:58.619 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker
 
00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
if I know that Des is already in the
 
00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:05.160 align:start position:0%
process of writing the rules and I have
 
00:38:07.370 --> 00:38:07.380 align:start position:0%
been assured that they will be completed
 
00:38:10.490 --> 00:38:10.500 align:start position:0%
in August of 2024.
 
00:38:12.829 --> 00:38:12.839 align:start position:0%
in that the permitting process takes a
 
00:38:16.670 --> 00:38:16.680 align:start position:0%
minimum of two years minimum
 
00:38:19.010 --> 00:38:19.020 align:start position:0%
and Mr Speaker if I know that this is a
 
00:38:21.170 --> 00:38:21.180 align:start position:0%
feel-good bill that we in the ENA
 
00:38:23.150 --> 00:38:23.160 align:start position:0%
committee we're told that this would be
 
00:38:25.849 --> 00:38:25.859 align:start position:0%
the only Bill the executive branch would
 
00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
sign by someone at DES and that a
 
00:38:31.130 --> 00:38:31.140 align:start position:0%
lobbyist for one of the parties
 
00:38:34.730 --> 00:38:34.740 align:start position:0%
uh helped with the language
 
00:38:38.089 --> 00:38:38.099 align:start position:0%
and Mr Speaker if I know that any
 
00:38:40.190 --> 00:38:40.200 align:start position:0%
information given to Des by the
 
00:38:42.890 --> 00:38:42.900 align:start position:0%
consultant can be ignored
 
00:38:46.430 --> 00:38:46.440 align:start position:0%
let me repeat that can be ignored why
 
00:38:48.410 --> 00:38:48.420 align:start position:0%
would I then spend two hundred thousand
 
00:38:51.770 --> 00:38:51.780 align:start position:0%
dollars of taxpayer money
 
00:38:54.530 --> 00:38:54.540 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know that as a member
 
00:38:56.390 --> 00:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
who lives in The Lakes Region the
 
00:38:58.609 --> 00:38:58.619 align:start position:0%
protection of our Lakes is not something
 
00:39:01.130 --> 00:39:01.140 align:start position:0%
that we should take lightly
 
00:39:04.130 --> 00:39:04.140 align:start position:0%
and finally Mr Speaker we are the
 
00:39:06.890 --> 00:39:06.900 align:start position:0%
legislative branch
 
00:39:10.190 --> 00:39:10.200 align:start position:0%
elected by our constituents
 
00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
we are beholden to them not to the
 
00:39:16.609 --> 00:39:16.619 align:start position:0%
executive branch not to an agency and
 
00:39:18.829 --> 00:39:18.839 align:start position:0%
certainly not to any lobbying group
 
00:39:21.170 --> 00:39:21.180 align:start position:0%
would I now press the red button for
 
00:39:24.109 --> 00:39:24.119 align:start position:0%
non-concur thank you Mr Speaker do you
 
00:39:25.550 --> 00:39:25.560 align:start position:0%

75.
 
00:49:28.370 --> 00:49:28.380 align:start position:0%
I was on that committee and my no vote

rules and we follow our rules
 
00:49:43.430 --> 00:49:43.440 align:start position:0%
but with respect to HB 75 and it's body
 
00:49:46.849 --> 00:49:46.859 align:start position:0%
double HB 270 which Municipal and County

75 is a redistricting Bill and
 
00:50:01.069 --> 00:50:01.079 align:start position:0%

00:50:10.370 --> 00:50:10.380 align:start position:0%
in the majority runs that process which
 
00:50:13.309 --> 00:50:13.319 align:start position:0%
is exactly what happened last year the
 
00:50:15.470 --> 00:50:15.480 align:start position:0%
Republicans took charge of redistricting
 
00:50:18.109 --> 00:50:18.119 align:start position:0%
the whole state including its County
 
00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
Commissioner districts
 
00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
they made no changes to Stratford County
 
00:50:26.450 --> 00:50:26.460 align:start position:0%
when asked in last week's Committee of
 
00:50:28.970 --> 00:50:28.980 align:start position:0%
conference why they didn't seek changes
 
00:50:31.089 --> 00:50:31.099 align:start position:0%
when they had the opportunity to do so
 
00:50:34.130 --> 00:50:34.140 align:start position:0%
one of the sponsors who was also a key
 
00:50:36.530 --> 00:50:36.540 align:start position:0%
member of the House special committee on
 
00:50:39.349 --> 00:50:39.359 align:start position:0%
redistricting said and I quote
 
00:50:42.829 --> 00:50:42.839 align:start position:0%
there just wasn't time we were too busy
 
00:50:46.250 --> 00:50:46.260 align:start position:0%
and it would have muddied the waters
 
00:50:49.309 --> 00:50:49.319 align:start position:0%
the consequence of that decision was the
 
00:50:53.170 --> 00:50:53.180 align:start position:0%
passage of HB 54 in November 2021
 
00:50:55.790 --> 00:50:55.800 align:start position:0%
legislation that was part and parcel
 
00:50:58.390 --> 00:50:58.400 align:start position:0%
over the overall redistricting process
 
00:51:02.390 --> 00:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
HP 54 sets forth the county commissioner
 
00:51:04.370 --> 00:51:04.380 align:start position:0%
districts in New Hampshire for the next
 
00:51:06.589 --> 00:51:06.599 align:start position:0%
10 years
 
00:51:09.589 --> 00:51:09.599 align:start position:0%
so why now when redistricting according
 
00:51:11.150 --> 00:51:11.160 align:start position:0%
to our rules
 
00:51:15.049 --> 00:51:15.059 align:start position:0%
is over are we back at it again
 
00:51:18.410 --> 00:51:18.420 align:start position:0%
and how according to those same rules do
 
00:51:21.230 --> 00:51:21.240 align:start position:0%
we justify going back in time to cherry
 
00:51:23.930 --> 00:51:23.940 align:start position:0%
pick just one component out of the whole
 
00:51:23.940 --> 00:51:25.130 align:start position:0%
pick just one component out of the whole
process

00:51:25.130 --> 00:51:25.140 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:51:27.410 --> 00:51:27.420 align:start position:0%
I guess we have to take the word of HB
 
00:51:29.930 --> 00:51:29.940 align:start position:0%
75 sponsor from the other side of the
 
00:51:32.750 --> 00:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
wall when he said last week in response
 
00:51:36.049 --> 00:51:36.059 align:start position:0%
to that question and I quote we're not
 
00:51:38.870 --> 00:51:38.880 align:start position:0%
redistricting we're just creating new
 
00:51:42.049 --> 00:51:42.059 align:start position:0%
districts for the commissioners
 
00:51:44.210 --> 00:51:44.220 align:start position:0%
I don't know about you but that's a
 
00:51:46.609 --> 00:51:46.619 align:start position:0%
little bit of a head scratcher for me
 
00:51:49.790 --> 00:51:49.800 align:start position:0%
let's face facts we don't redistrict
 
00:51:52.970 --> 00:51:52.980 align:start position:0%
counties outside the 10-year cycle
 
00:51:56.030 --> 00:51:56.040 align:start position:0%
inside that cycle we may change what
 
00:51:57.770 --> 00:51:57.780 align:start position:0%
County Commissioners can do under
 
00:52:00.710 --> 00:52:00.720 align:start position:0%
existing law or whether they're elected
 
00:52:03.410 --> 00:52:03.420 align:start position:0%
at large or by District but we don't
 
00:52:05.690 --> 00:52:05.700 align:start position:0%
mess with the districts and we certainly
 
00:52:08.150 --> 00:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
don't create new counties for the
 
00:52:10.010 --> 00:52:10.020 align:start position:0%
Commissioners County districts for the
 
00:52:10.020 --> 00:52:11.450 align:start position:0%
Commissioners County districts for the
commissioners

00:52:11.450 --> 00:52:11.460 align:start position:0%
commissioners
 
00:52:14.809 --> 00:52:14.819 align:start position:0%
we've been told that HB 75 is just a
 
00:52:17.809 --> 00:52:17.819 align:start position:0%
simple attempt to apply consistency to
 
00:52:19.970 --> 00:52:19.980 align:start position:0%
how counties govern themselves
 
00:52:22.430 --> 00:52:22.440 align:start position:0%
and to bring Stratford in line with all
 
00:52:23.569 --> 00:52:23.579 align:start position:0%
the others
 
00:52:27.290 --> 00:52:27.300 align:start position:0%
but again if that consistency was such a
 
00:52:27.300 --> 00:52:29.510 align:start position:0%
but again if that consistency was such a
priority

00:52:29.510 --> 00:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
priority
 
00:52:31.670 --> 00:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
Why didn't it come up
 
00:52:34.430 --> 00:52:34.440 align:start position:0%
when why was it ignored last year when a
 
00:52:37.549 --> 00:52:37.559 align:start position:0%
change could have been lawfully made
 
00:52:40.370 --> 00:52:40.380 align:start position:0%
make no mistake this isn't just about
 
00:52:43.430 --> 00:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
Stratford County because once we Stout
 
00:52:46.309 --> 00:52:46.319 align:start position:0%
down the road of changing electoral Maps
 
00:52:49.670 --> 00:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
outside the 10-year cycle we're entering
 
00:52:51.770 --> 00:52:51.780 align:start position:0%
dangerous territory
 
00:52:54.470 --> 00:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
throw away the rules and we'll all be
 
00:52:56.870 --> 00:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
looking over our shoulders to see which
 
00:52:59.329 --> 00:52:59.339 align:start position:0%
member of this house or the body on the
 
00:53:00.890 --> 00:53:00.900 align:start position:0%
other side of the wall
 
00:53:03.589 --> 00:53:03.599 align:start position:0%
suddenly sees problems in our community
 
00:53:06.829 --> 00:53:06.839 align:start position:0%
or our County that require the Electoral
 
00:53:08.809 --> 00:53:08.819 align:start position:0%
maps to be redrawn
 
00:53:12.349 --> 00:53:12.359 align:start position:0%
let's not go there we don't have to our
 
00:53:15.109 --> 00:53:15.119 align:start position:0%
constituents don't want us to we have
 
00:53:17.329 --> 00:53:17.339 align:start position:0%
more important business to take care of
 
00:53:20.210 --> 00:53:20.220 align:start position:0%
on their behalf let's stick to the rules
 
00:53:23.210 --> 00:53:23.220 align:start position:0%
because without them all this becomes a
 
00:53:25.670 --> 00:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
partisan free for all and the good work
 
00:53:28.190 --> 00:53:28.200 align:start position:0%
we've done together in this session and
 
00:53:30.530 --> 00:53:30.540 align:start position:0%
hope to do when the next will be subject
 
00:53:32.990 --> 00:53:33.000 align:start position:0%
to a terrible precedent if this bill is
 
00:53:35.870 --> 00:53:35.880 align:start position:0%
passed I urge you to vote no on
 
00:53:37.430 --> 00:53:37.440 align:start position:0%
accepting the committee of conference
 
00:53:40.490 --> 00:53:40.500 align:start position:0%
report for HB 75 and I requested
 
00:53:43.490 --> 00:53:43.500 align:start position:0%
division vote Mr Speaker
 
00:53:45.170 --> 00:53:45.180 align:start position:0%
chair recognized representative Lynn
 
00:53:49.670 --> 00:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:51.530 --> 00:53:51.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker good morning
 
00:53:51.540 --> 00:53:53.150 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker good morning
everyone

00:53:53.150 --> 00:53:53.160 align:start position:0%
everyone
 
00:53:55.250 --> 00:53:55.260 align:start position:0%
it seems like a little bit of deja vu
 
00:53:55.260 --> 00:53:57.950 align:start position:0%
it seems like a little bit of deja vu
here

00:53:57.950 --> 00:53:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:59.750 --> 00:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
so we're going to start out by talking
 
00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:00.890 align:start position:0%
so we're going to start out by talking
about

00:54:00.890 --> 00:54:00.900 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:54:03.589 --> 00:54:03.599 align:start position:0%
how I opened this last time and that is
 
00:54:05.690 --> 00:54:05.700 align:start position:0%
Stratford County
 
00:54:08.450 --> 00:54:08.460 align:start position:0%
is the only County out of our 10
 
00:54:11.569 --> 00:54:11.579 align:start position:0%
counties in our states that do not have
 
00:54:14.990 --> 00:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner districts
 
00:54:18.230 --> 00:54:18.240 align:start position:0%
now during the COC an individual on the
 
00:54:20.270 --> 00:54:20.280 align:start position:0%
other side of the wall proposed and
 
00:54:23.030 --> 00:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
proffered a different districting map
 
00:54:25.089 --> 00:54:25.099 align:start position:0%
notice I didn't say
 
00:54:28.430 --> 00:54:28.440 align:start position:0%
redistricting but a districting map that
 
00:54:29.990 --> 00:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
he believed the current Commissioners
 
00:54:31.670 --> 00:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
and the supporters would find more
 
00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:33.410 align:start position:0%
and the supporters would find more
acceptable

00:54:33.410 --> 00:54:33.420 align:start position:0%
acceptable
 
00:54:36.710 --> 00:54:36.720 align:start position:0%
that was definitively turned down
 
00:54:39.530 --> 00:54:39.540 align:start position:0%
so what have we gotten instead
 
00:54:42.170 --> 00:54:42.180 align:start position:0%
it's what I call fear grenades
 
00:54:42.180 --> 00:54:44.990 align:start position:0%
it's what I call fear grenades
fear-mongering

00:54:44.990 --> 00:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
fear-mongering
 
00:54:48.650 --> 00:54:48.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:51.069 --> 00:54:51.079 align:start position:0%
we've heard over and over that this is
 
00:54:53.950 --> 00:54:53.960 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional factually
 
00:54:57.170 --> 00:54:57.180 align:start position:0%
representative I guess fear mongering is
 
00:54:59.690 --> 00:54:59.700 align:start position:0%
not a proper application to our
 
00:55:04.270 --> 00:55:04.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:12.049 --> 00:55:12.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:16.670 --> 00:55:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:18.049 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:55:18.049 --> 00:55:18.059 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:55:20.870 --> 00:55:20.880 align:start position:0%
anyway unconstitutional factually
 
00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:23.030 align:start position:0%
anyway unconstitutional factually
incorrect

00:55:23.030 --> 00:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
incorrect
 
00:55:24.770 --> 00:55:24.780 align:start position:0%
and those who have been making this
 
00:55:27.049 --> 00:55:27.059 align:start position:0%
promo pronouncement are simply
 
00:55:29.630 --> 00:55:29.640 align:start position:0%
regurgitating the belief of a 40-year
 
00:55:32.089 --> 00:55:32.099 align:start position:0%
commissioner from Stratford County
 
00:55:36.010 --> 00:55:36.020 align:start position:0%
who also believes every County
 
00:55:38.210 --> 00:55:38.220 align:start position:0%
your county
 
00:55:39.950 --> 00:55:39.960 align:start position:0%
should elect their Commissioners at
 
00:55:43.730 --> 00:55:43.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:46.370 --> 00:55:46.380 align:start position:0%
as we've said time and time again this
 
00:55:48.349 --> 00:55:48.359 align:start position:0%
is not redistricting
 
00:55:50.750 --> 00:55:50.760 align:start position:0%
this is districting the county just has
 
00:55:52.849 --> 00:55:52.859 align:start position:0%
just has every other of the nine
 
00:55:54.589 --> 00:55:54.599 align:start position:0%
counties in the states have done over
 
00:55:56.510 --> 00:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
the past decades
 
00:55:59.650 --> 00:55:59.660 align:start position:0%
and many of those guess what during
 
00:56:02.990 --> 00:56:03.000 align:start position:0%
non-reddistricting years
 
00:56:04.970 --> 00:56:04.980 align:start position:0%
now we hear
 
00:56:08.089 --> 00:56:08.099 align:start position:0%
let the process work well guess what the
 
00:56:11.809 --> 00:56:11.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:14.569 --> 00:56:14.579 align:start position:0%
the bill originally started out in the
 
00:56:16.970 --> 00:56:16.980 align:start position:0%
house committee
 
00:56:19.430 --> 00:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
it was properly noticed it was a
 
00:56:21.710 --> 00:56:21.720 align:start position:0%
properly noticed Committee hearing
 
00:56:23.510 --> 00:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
it was followed by a properly noticed
 
00:56:25.970 --> 00:56:25.980 align:start position:0%
Senate hearing and only a few spoke out
 
00:56:27.589 --> 00:56:27.599 align:start position:0%
at our hearing
 
00:56:29.930 --> 00:56:29.940 align:start position:0%
it was later that the calls for the let
 
00:56:32.809 --> 00:56:32.819 align:start position:0%
the process work
 
00:56:34.250 --> 00:56:34.260 align:start position:0%
came out
 
00:56:38.990 --> 00:56:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:41.990 --> 00:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
latest that we've heard and some of you
 
00:56:44.710 --> 00:56:44.720 align:start position:0%
may have seen this in the lobbyist note
 
00:56:47.870 --> 00:56:47.880 align:start position:0%
chaos instability will rule pure
 
00:56:49.970 --> 00:56:49.980 align:start position:0%
nonsense we're not going to have chaos
 
00:56:51.589 --> 00:56:51.599 align:start position:0%
and instability
 
00:56:54.290 --> 00:56:54.300 align:start position:0%
this process has happened nine other
 
00:56:57.349 --> 00:56:57.359 align:start position:0%
times in our state
 
00:57:00.290 --> 00:57:00.300 align:start position:0%
and nobody has ever attempted to
 
00:57:02.569 --> 00:57:02.579 align:start position:0%
redistrict after the 10-year
 
00:57:07.309 --> 00:57:07.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:10.130 --> 00:57:10.140 align:start position:0%
our County Stratford county is entitled
 
00:57:13.250 --> 00:57:13.260 align:start position:0%
to the same election process that every
 
00:57:16.609 --> 00:57:16.619 align:start position:0%
other County already enjoys
 
00:57:21.109 --> 00:57:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:24.349 --> 00:57:24.359 align:start position:0%
so by voting to approve the decision of
 
00:57:26.809 --> 00:57:26.819 align:start position:0%
the committee of conference
 
00:57:30.650 --> 00:57:30.660 align:start position:0%
the de facto gerrymandered elections for
 
00:57:33.049 --> 00:57:33.059 align:start position:0%
County Commissioners that has gone on in
 
00:57:35.750 --> 00:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
Stratford County for decades will come
 
00:57:37.970 --> 00:57:37.980 align:start position:0%

I would like to move to place the bill
 
00:57:57.650 --> 00:57:57.660 align:start position:0%

Bill 75 on the table
 
00:58:06.650 --> 00:58:06.660 align:start position:0%

00:58:58.970 --> 00:58:58.980 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is the table House
 
00:59:03.109 --> 00:59:03.119 align:start position:0%
Bill 75 this is a division vote
 
00:59:06.470 --> 00:59:06.480 align:start position:0%
members should be in their seats
 
00:59:09.170 --> 00:59:09.180 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative stavis
 
00:59:17.270 --> 00:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:20.030 --> 00:59:20.040 align:start position:0%
if I know that redistricting at all
 
00:59:22.309 --> 00:59:22.319 align:start position:0%
levels including County Commissioner
 
00:59:24.950 --> 00:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
districts takes place once every 10
 
00:59:27.650 --> 00:59:27.660 align:start position:0%
years and is controlled by the party in
 
00:59:29.329 --> 00:59:29.339 align:start position:0%
power at the time
 
00:59:32.030 --> 00:59:32.040 align:start position:0%
and if I know that that time was a year
 
00:59:34.609 --> 00:59:34.619 align:start position:0%
ago when the Republican Party held a
 
00:59:36.349 --> 00:59:36.359 align:start position:0%
sizable majority
 
00:59:38.990 --> 00:59:39.000 align:start position:0%
and if I know that the Republicans who
 
00:59:41.630 --> 00:59:41.640 align:start position:0%
oversaw that redistricting process a
 
00:59:44.690 --> 00:59:44.700 align:start position:0%
year ago recommended no changes to
 
00:59:46.970 --> 00:59:46.980 align:start position:0%
Stratford County though they now
 
00:59:49.670 --> 00:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
suddenly insist such changes are
 
00:59:51.230 --> 00:59:51.240 align:start position:0%
urgently needed
 
00:59:54.289 --> 00:59:54.299 align:start position:0%
if I further know that HB 75 sponsors
 
00:59:56.750 --> 00:59:56.760 align:start position:0%
claim that this bill seeks only to bring
 
00:59:58.430 --> 00:59:58.440 align:start position:0%
Strafford County's commissioner
 
01:00:00.710 --> 01:00:00.720 align:start position:0%
elections in line with other New
 
01:00:03.829 --> 01:00:03.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire counties though no such effort
 
01:00:06.710 --> 01:00:06.720 align:start position:0%
was made last year when redistricting
 
01:00:08.329 --> 01:00:08.339 align:start position:0%
was taking place
 
01:00:11.329 --> 01:00:11.339 align:start position:0%
and finally if I know that this is a
 
01:00:13.670 --> 01:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
partisan effort meant to change the
 
01:00:15.650 --> 01:00:15.660 align:start position:0%
political makeup of the Strafford County
 
01:00:18.230 --> 01:00:18.240 align:start position:0%
Commissioners outside of the mandated
 
01:00:20.630 --> 01:00:20.640 align:start position:0%
cycle and against the rules that govern
 
01:00:23.450 --> 01:00:23.460 align:start position:0%
how such changes can lawfully be made
 
01:00:26.630 --> 01:00:26.640 align:start position:0%
when I now press the green button to
 
01:00:28.970 --> 01:00:28.980 align:start position:0%

turcott for parliamentary inquiry
 
01:00:35.930 --> 01:00:35.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:00:37.970 --> 01:00:37.980 align:start position:0%
if I know Stratford county is the only
 
01:00:40.010 --> 01:00:40.020 align:start position:0%
County of the 10 in our state that does
 
01:00:42.650 --> 01:00:42.660 align:start position:0%
not have commissioner districts and that
 
01:00:44.569 --> 01:00:44.579 align:start position:0%
this bill would Rectify that
 
01:00:44.579 --> 01:00:45.890 align:start position:0%
this bill would Rectify that
disadvantage

01:00:45.890 --> 01:00:45.900 align:start position:0%
disadvantage
 
01:00:48.230 --> 01:00:48.240 align:start position:0%
and if I know that every other County in
 
01:00:49.789 --> 01:00:49.799 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has transitioned to
 
01:00:51.770 --> 01:00:51.780 align:start position:0%
deathstrix for their Commissioners over
 
01:00:54.890 --> 01:00:54.900 align:start position:0%
the past decades during times other than
 
01:00:57.170 --> 01:00:57.180 align:start position:0%
the 10-year redistricting when the
 
01:01:01.130 --> 01:01:01.140 align:start position:0%
10-year redistricting takes place
 
01:01:03.530 --> 01:01:03.540 align:start position:0%
if I know Stratford County like every
 
01:01:05.210 --> 01:01:05.220 align:start position:0%
other County in New Hampshire deserves
 
01:01:07.210 --> 01:01:07.220 align:start position:0%
its Commissioners to be elected
 
01:01:09.650 --> 01:01:09.660 align:start position:0%
utilizing districts
 
01:01:12.289 --> 01:01:12.299 align:start position:0%
and if I know a commissioner of 40 years
 
01:01:15.049 --> 01:01:15.059 align:start position:0%
in Stratford County believes York County
 
01:01:17.569 --> 01:01:17.579 align:start position:0%
should elect your Commissioners without
 
01:01:20.329 --> 01:01:20.339 align:start position:0%
districts and at Large
 
01:01:22.910 --> 01:01:22.920 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:04:19.549 --> 01:04:19.559 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know that county-wide
 
01:04:21.589 --> 01:04:21.599 align:start position:0%
Services currently provided by the
 
01:04:23.329 --> 01:04:23.339 align:start position:0%
Stratford County Commissioners are
 
01:04:25.430 --> 01:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
available to all residents of Stratford
 
01:04:28.010 --> 01:04:28.020 align:start position:0%
County and those budgeted services are
 
01:04:30.650 --> 01:04:30.660 align:start position:0%
approved annually by the delegation many
 
01:04:32.930 --> 01:04:32.940 align:start position:0%
times unanimously
 
01:04:36.170 --> 01:04:36.180 align:start position:0%
and if I know that two previous bills to
 
01:04:38.210 --> 01:04:38.220 align:start position:0%
create districts in Stratford County
 
01:04:41.569 --> 01:04:41.579 align:start position:0%
when itl in this body
 
01:04:42.950 --> 01:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
and if I know that we have heard
 
01:04:44.690 --> 01:04:44.700 align:start position:0%
numerous times that there was a
 
01:04:46.789 --> 01:04:46.799 align:start position:0%
conscious decision not to address this
 
01:04:48.950 --> 01:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
issue of District districts for
 
01:04:50.630 --> 01:04:50.640 align:start position:0%
Stratford County Commissioners when the
 
01:04:52.789 --> 01:04:52.799 align:start position:0%
house was redrawing the lines for County
 
01:04:55.370 --> 01:04:55.380 align:start position:0%
Commissioners during the decennial
 
01:04:57.410 --> 01:04:57.420 align:start position:0%
and if I know that redrawing lines
 
01:04:59.510 --> 01:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
outside of the 10-year window is thought
 
01:05:01.730 --> 01:05:01.740 align:start position:0%
to be unconstitutional
 
01:05:03.829 --> 01:05:03.839 align:start position:0%
and if Mr Speaker if I know that this
 
01:05:05.750 --> 01:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
bill would create a precedent whereby
 
01:05:08.510 --> 01:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
every County would be susceptible to
 
01:05:10.370 --> 01:05:10.380 align:start position:0%
redistricting for County Commissioners
 
01:05:13.250 --> 01:05:13.260 align:start position:0%
and executive counselors by the party in
 
01:05:15.589 --> 01:05:15.599 align:start position:0%
the majority in any year
 
01:05:17.450 --> 01:05:17.460 align:start position:0%
then Mr Speaker would I press the red
 
01:05:19.789 --> 01:05:19.799 align:start position:0%

once again if I know that Stratford
 
01:05:31.079 --> 01:05:31.970 align:start position:0%
once again if I know that Stratford
County

01:05:31.970 --> 01:05:31.980 align:start position:0%
County
 
01:05:34.250 --> 01:05:34.260 align:start position:0%
is the only County out of the 10 in our
 
01:05:36.049 --> 01:05:36.059 align:start position:0%
state that does not have a commission or
 
01:05:36.059 --> 01:05:37.190 align:start position:0%
state that does not have a commission or
District

01:05:37.190 --> 01:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
District
 
01:05:39.109 --> 01:05:39.119 align:start position:0%
and this bill would Rectify that
 
01:05:39.119 --> 01:05:40.670 align:start position:0%
and this bill would Rectify that
disadvantage

01:05:40.670 --> 01:05:40.680 align:start position:0%
disadvantage
 
01:05:43.069 --> 01:05:43.079 align:start position:0%
if I know that during the redistricting
 
01:05:43.079 --> 01:05:44.930 align:start position:0%
if I know that during the redistricting
process

01:05:44.930 --> 01:05:44.940 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:05:46.910 --> 01:05:46.920 align:start position:0%
two years ago
 
01:05:49.390 --> 01:05:49.400 align:start position:0%
that the decision was distinctly made
 
01:05:52.549 --> 01:05:52.559 align:start position:0%
not to include this in the redistricting
 
01:05:52.559 --> 01:05:54.049 align:start position:0%
not to include this in the redistricting
process

01:05:54.049 --> 01:05:54.059 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:05:59.030 --> 01:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:01.309 --> 01:06:01.319 align:start position:0%
and by seeing what has gone on on this
 
01:06:04.069 --> 01:06:04.079 align:start position:0%
bill now I think everybody could agree
 
01:06:09.950 --> 01:06:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:12.650 --> 01:06:12.660 align:start position:0%
if I know Stratford County like every
 
01:06:13.789 --> 01:06:13.799 align:start position:0%
other County
 
01:06:16.190 --> 01:06:16.200 align:start position:0%
deserves to have their Commissioners
 
01:06:19.130 --> 01:06:19.140 align:start position:0%
elected by districts
 
01:06:22.670 --> 01:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
would I now press the green button to
 
01:06:24.470 --> 01:06:24.480 align:start position:0%

the committee of conference on HB 275
 
01:10:31.910 --> 01:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
every New Hampshire student should have
 
01:10:35.570 --> 01:10:35.580 align:start position:0%
available to them a publicly a public
 
01:10:37.790 --> 01:10:37.800 align:start position:0%
school funded through City
 
01:10:41.689 --> 01:10:41.699 align:start position:0%
state and town taxes and not by
 
01:10:45.830 --> 01:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
individual family bank accounts
 
01:10:48.950 --> 01:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
75 focuses on middle schools and high
 
01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:50.090 align:start position:0%
75 focuses on middle schools and high
schools

01:10:50.090 --> 01:10:50.100 align:start position:0%
schools
 
01:10:53.270 --> 01:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
it authorizes local school boards to
 
01:10:56.570 --> 01:10:56.580 align:start position:0%
establish tuition contracts with another
 
01:11:00.229 --> 01:11:00.239 align:start position:0%
public school or any private school
 
01:11:02.810 --> 01:11:02.820 align:start position:0%
that the board approves
 
01:11:05.410 --> 01:11:05.420 align:start position:0%
the school board would establish a
 
01:11:07.550 --> 01:11:07.560 align:start position:0%
tuition-based cost
 
01:11:10.610 --> 01:11:10.620 align:start position:0%
let's save fourteen thousand dollars
 
01:11:13.070 --> 01:11:13.080 align:start position:0%
but if the alternative school tuition is
 
01:11:16.970 --> 01:11:16.980 align:start position:0%
more let's say nineteen thousand dollars
 
01:11:19.669 --> 01:11:19.679 align:start position:0%
a family choosing the alternative school
 
01:11:22.250 --> 01:11:22.260 align:start position:0%
would have to pay the difference
 
01:11:24.290 --> 01:11:24.300 align:start position:0%
in this example it would be five
 
01:11:26.330 --> 01:11:26.340 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
01:11:29.209 --> 01:11:29.219 align:start position:0%
this is a wrong approach to providing a
 
01:11:32.390 --> 01:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
free public education and violates the
 
01:11:35.270 --> 01:11:35.280 align:start position:0%
historic tradition of a free public
 
01:11:38.689 --> 01:11:38.699 align:start position:0%
education established by Horace Mann in
 
01:11:38.699 --> 01:11:41.209 align:start position:0%
education established by Horace Mann in
1839.

01:11:41.209 --> 01:11:41.219 align:start position:0%
1839.
 
01:11:43.610 --> 01:11:43.620 align:start position:0%
public schools have always provided
 
01:11:46.669 --> 01:11:46.679 align:start position:0%
equity in educational opportunities for
 
01:11:46.679 --> 01:11:48.050 align:start position:0%
equity in educational opportunities for
students

01:11:48.050 --> 01:11:48.060 align:start position:0%
students
 
01:11:51.430 --> 01:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
recently the governor signed into law
 
01:11:55.910 --> 01:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
SSP 77 which requires that school boards
 
01:11:58.430 --> 01:11:58.440 align:start position:0%
approve a list of private schools with
 
01:12:00.290 --> 01:12:00.300 align:start position:0%
tuition agreements
 
01:12:05.510 --> 01:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
so with HB 275 and SB 77 every school
 
01:12:07.610 --> 01:12:07.620 align:start position:0%
district would have to establish tuition
 
01:12:09.830 --> 01:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
agreements with private schools or other
 
01:12:12.290 --> 01:12:12.300 align:start position:0%
public schools and a minimum tuition
 
01:12:15.229 --> 01:12:15.239 align:start position:0%
paid by the taxpayer
 
01:12:19.310 --> 01:12:19.320 align:start position:0%
with two set with HP 275 a family
 
01:12:21.709 --> 01:12:21.719 align:start position:0%
choosing a school with a higher tuition
 
01:12:24.770 --> 01:12:24.780 align:start position:0%
would pay the difference with local
 
01:12:27.290 --> 01:12:27.300 align:start position:0%
tuition monies coming from the public
 
01:12:30.350 --> 01:12:30.360 align:start position:0%
schools this is a bad idea
 
01:12:34.669 --> 01:12:34.679 align:start position:0%
HB 275 would increase the inequities in
 
01:12:37.189 --> 01:12:37.199 align:start position:0%
educational opportunities where some
 
01:12:39.410 --> 01:12:39.420 align:start position:0%
families who could afford to pay the
 
01:12:42.290 --> 01:12:42.300 align:start position:0%
extra would get a taxpayer-funded
 
01:12:45.169 --> 01:12:45.179 align:start position:0%
subsidy for a school that could provide
 
01:12:47.570 --> 01:12:47.580 align:start position:0%
a different learning experience or a
 
01:12:50.330 --> 01:12:50.340 align:start position:0%
special sports team access or
 
01:12:52.130 --> 01:12:52.140 align:start position:0%
extracurricular activities while
 
01:12:55.010 --> 01:12:55.020 align:start position:0%
families that couldn't afford to pay
 
01:12:56.390 --> 01:12:56.400 align:start position:0%
more would be left
 
01:12:59.930 --> 01:12:59.940 align:start position:0%
in unfunded and under-resourced schools
 
01:13:03.229 --> 01:13:03.239 align:start position:0%
all of our 165
 
01:13:05.930 --> 01:13:05.940 align:start position:0%
000 public school students deserve
 
01:13:08.270 --> 01:13:08.280 align:start position:0%
well-funded neighborhood community
 
01:13:10.610 --> 01:13:10.620 align:start position:0%
Public Schools where they can learn and
 
01:13:13.490 --> 01:13:13.500 align:start position:0%
Thrive increasing inequities and
 
01:13:16.010 --> 01:13:16.020 align:start position:0%
educational opportunities instead of
 
01:13:18.470 --> 01:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
fully funding local Community Schools is
 
01:13:21.290 --> 01:13:21.300 align:start position:0%
unfair to granted State students and
 
01:13:23.930 --> 01:13:23.940 align:start position:0%
their families as well as taxpayers
 
01:13:27.110 --> 01:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
finally colleagues there is little data
 
01:13:32.090 --> 01:13:32.100 align:start position:0%
on the need for s for HB 275 there was
 
01:13:34.430 --> 01:13:34.440 align:start position:0%
no Statewide data ever provided to
 
01:13:36.830 --> 01:13:36.840 align:start position:0%
either the house education committee or
 
01:13:38.390 --> 01:13:38.400 align:start position:0%
the committee of conference on the
 
01:13:41.149 --> 01:13:41.159 align:start position:0%
breadth of the need for this bill other
 
01:13:44.149 --> 01:13:44.159 align:start position:0%
than one specific School District
 
01:13:47.870 --> 01:13:47.880 align:start position:0%
until we know the Exotic exact extent of
 
01:13:50.750 --> 01:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
the need or this bill it is premature
 
01:13:53.390 --> 01:13:53.400 align:start position:0%
and unwise for the legislature to act
 
01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:55.010 align:start position:0%
and unwise for the legislature to act
accordingly

01:13:55.010 --> 01:13:55.020 align:start position:0%
accordingly
 
01:13:57.290 --> 01:13:57.300 align:start position:0%
think hard about the vote we are about
 
01:13:58.550 --> 01:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
to make
 
01:14:00.770 --> 01:14:00.780 align:start position:0%
think about asking your constituents
 
01:14:02.570 --> 01:14:02.580 align:start position:0%
especially those who are retired and
 
01:14:05.330 --> 01:14:05.340 align:start position:0%
living on fixed incomes to dig deeper
 
01:14:08.149 --> 01:14:08.159 align:start position:0%
into their property tax paid for because
 
01:14:10.669 --> 01:14:10.679 align:start position:0%
they've already paid for public schools
 
01:14:13.010 --> 01:14:13.020 align:start position:0%
further we need to work to ensure that
 
01:14:14.810 --> 01:14:14.820 align:start position:0%
every Public School creates the best
 
01:14:17.209 --> 01:14:17.219 align:start position:0%
learning opportunities for all students
 
01:14:19.970 --> 01:14:19.980 align:start position:0%
to help all Spanish state families
 
01:14:22.070 --> 01:14:22.080 align:start position:0%
without them having to pay additional
 
01:14:24.950 --> 01:14:24.960 align:start position:0%
taxes tax tuition from their own bank
 
01:14:27.830 --> 01:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
accounts I urge you to vote no and
 
01:14:29.270 --> 01:14:29.280 align:start position:0%
reject the committee of conference
 
01:14:33.290 --> 01:14:33.300 align:start position:0%
report on HB 275. thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:14:36.709 --> 01:14:36.719 align:start position:0%
and I request a division vote
 
01:14:38.570 --> 01:14:38.580 align:start position:0%
gee I recognize representative Ladd to
 
01:14:46.010 --> 01:14:46.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:48.649 --> 01:14:48.659 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:14:50.390 --> 01:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
I think we need to get our facts squared
 
01:14:51.770 --> 01:14:51.780 align:start position:0%
away here
 
01:14:54.950 --> 01:14:54.960 align:start position:0%
the committee conference addressed the
 
01:14:59.270 --> 01:14:59.280 align:start position:0%
Senate version of 275 and amended it in
 
01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:01.010 align:start position:0%
Senate version of 275 and amended it in
committee

01:15:01.010 --> 01:15:01.020 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:15:03.590 --> 01:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
the amendment looked at the tuition
 
01:15:05.390 --> 01:15:05.400 align:start position:0%
school program
 
01:15:07.970 --> 01:15:07.980 align:start position:0%
as it's established now
 
01:15:11.030 --> 01:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
and all schools which are proved under
 
01:15:14.330 --> 01:15:14.340 align:start position:0%
the school approval program for tuition
 
01:15:14.340 --> 01:15:15.830 align:start position:0%
the school approval program for tuition

01:15:17.870 --> 01:15:17.880 align:start position:0%
sending districts to the receiving
 
01:15:21.290 --> 01:15:21.300 align:start position:0%

01:15:27.649 --> 01:15:27.659 align:start position:0%
the version that we looked at that came
 
01:15:31.550 --> 01:15:31.560 align:start position:0%
from the senate had the terminology of
 
01:15:35.390 --> 01:15:35.400 align:start position:0%
anchor School within the terminology we
 
01:15:36.950 --> 01:15:36.960 align:start position:0%
know that there's many k through eights
 
01:15:39.169 --> 01:15:39.179 align:start position:0%
K through fours K through six is in this
 
01:15:42.290 --> 01:15:42.300 align:start position:0%
state that don't have the grades beyond
 
01:15:44.810 --> 01:15:44.820 align:start position:0%
the level which they have within the
 
01:15:47.209 --> 01:15:47.219 align:start position:0%
re the residence School
 
01:15:50.570 --> 01:15:50.580 align:start position:0%
so they tuition out they tuition to
 
01:15:52.850 --> 01:15:52.860 align:start position:0%
other school districts
 
01:15:55.310 --> 01:15:55.320 align:start position:0%
there are agreements contractual
 
01:15:55.320 --> 01:15:57.050 align:start position:0%
there are agreements contractual
agreements

01:15:57.050 --> 01:15:57.060 align:start position:0%
agreements
 
01:15:59.270 --> 01:15:59.280 align:start position:0%
that are approved by the sending board
 
01:16:02.149 --> 01:16:02.159 align:start position:0%
and the receiving board for those
 
01:16:04.310 --> 01:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
students which are moving out to one of
 
01:16:07.729 --> 01:16:07.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:10.550 --> 01:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
so the local board makes the decision
 
01:16:12.830 --> 01:16:12.840 align:start position:0%
you may have four or five different
 
01:16:14.870 --> 01:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
districts which you can tuition your
 
01:16:16.790 --> 01:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
kids to
 
01:16:19.130 --> 01:16:19.140 align:start position:0%
and there's many reasons why we have
 
01:16:22.970 --> 01:16:22.980 align:start position:0%
multiple districts oftentimes approve in
 
01:16:25.790 --> 01:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
the school tuition program
 
01:16:28.669 --> 01:16:28.679 align:start position:0%
simply fact based upon these are small
 
01:16:30.470 --> 01:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
districts many of them
 
01:16:33.590 --> 01:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
and parents work in towns which are in
 
01:16:35.570 --> 01:16:35.580 align:start position:0%
different directions
 
01:16:37.970 --> 01:16:37.980 align:start position:0%
the receiving schools also have
 
01:16:39.890 --> 01:16:39.900 align:start position:0%
different types of program offerings
 
01:16:42.350 --> 01:16:42.360 align:start position:0%
some of these receiving schools may have
 
01:16:44.090 --> 01:16:44.100 align:start position:0%
a Career Technical education built
 
01:16:46.189 --> 01:16:46.199 align:start position:0%
within that school
 
01:16:47.750 --> 01:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
they may have a wonderful theater
 
01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:48.890 align:start position:0%
they may have a wonderful theater
program

01:16:48.890 --> 01:16:48.900 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:16:50.630 --> 01:16:50.640 align:start position:0%
they might might have a wonderful
 
01:16:53.330 --> 01:16:53.340 align:start position:0%
Athletic program and all our children
 
01:16:55.970 --> 01:16:55.980 align:start position:0%
are different and unique and look to
 
01:16:59.090 --> 01:16:59.100 align:start position:0%
this sources or the services in these
 
01:17:01.790 --> 01:17:01.800 align:start position:0%
receiving schools which best fit their
 
01:17:01.800 --> 01:17:02.930 align:start position:0%
receiving schools which best fit their
needs

01:17:02.930 --> 01:17:02.940 align:start position:0%
needs
 
01:17:05.390 --> 01:17:05.400 align:start position:0%
now a parent can't just walk up to the
 
01:17:07.910 --> 01:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
school board and say I want my child
 
01:17:11.030 --> 01:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
going to holderness or Kimball Union
 
01:17:14.270 --> 01:17:14.280 align:start position:0%
or some other private school the school
 
01:17:17.090 --> 01:17:17.100 align:start position:0%
that they we send kids to under this
 
01:17:20.330 --> 01:17:20.340 align:start position:0%
program must be approved by the local
 
01:17:22.310 --> 01:17:22.320 align:start position:0%
school board
 
01:17:25.310 --> 01:17:25.320 align:start position:0%
so we took the word anchor school out of
 
01:17:27.470 --> 01:17:27.480 align:start position:0%
it we looked in legislation there's no
 
01:17:30.110 --> 01:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
such term yes there are a few districts
 
01:17:31.850 --> 01:17:31.860 align:start position:0%
that use this terminology in their
 
01:17:31.860 --> 01:17:33.169 align:start position:0%
that use this terminology in their
policies

01:17:33.169 --> 01:17:33.179 align:start position:0%
policies
 
01:17:36.110 --> 01:17:36.120 align:start position:0%
but we took it out and we put in wording
 
01:17:40.490 --> 01:17:40.500 align:start position:0%
that there must be at least one option
 
01:17:44.030 --> 01:17:44.040 align:start position:0%
in these contracts which are signed that
 
01:17:44.040 --> 01:17:44.990 align:start position:0%
in these contracts which are signed that
is

01:17:44.990 --> 01:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:17:47.330 --> 01:17:47.340 align:start position:0%
sending kids to
 
01:17:52.430 --> 01:17:52.440 align:start position:0%
Public Schools or a public Academy
 
01:17:55.790 --> 01:17:55.800 align:start position:0%
to be a public school you must be
 
01:17:58.310 --> 01:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
approved by the state board you must be
 
01:18:00.890 --> 01:18:00.900 align:start position:0%
also school that
 
01:18:04.430 --> 01:18:04.440 align:start position:0%
provides all those academic standards
 
01:18:06.649 --> 01:18:06.659 align:start position:0%
which are required by law
 
01:18:09.530 --> 01:18:09.540 align:start position:0%
and you must be also a school that meets
 
01:18:11.990 --> 01:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
the minimum School approvals for minimum
 
01:18:14.450 --> 01:18:14.460 align:start position:0%
standards for school approval Public
 
01:18:16.970 --> 01:18:16.980 align:start position:0%
School approval so we're talking about
 
01:18:19.010 --> 01:18:19.020 align:start position:0%
one of those four options or five
 
01:18:21.350 --> 01:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
options that District must must be one
 
01:18:25.130 --> 01:18:25.140 align:start position:0%
of these schools so that every child in
 
01:18:27.950 --> 01:18:27.960 align:start position:0%
the sending district has the option to
 
01:18:29.810 --> 01:18:29.820 align:start position:0%
attend a school which meets their
 
01:18:31.850 --> 01:18:31.860 align:start position:0%
services and their needs
 
01:18:34.850 --> 01:18:34.860 align:start position:0%
this bill is not a partisan bill in
 
01:18:37.910 --> 01:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
terms of the sending districts it's a
 
01:18:40.669 --> 01:18:40.679 align:start position:0%
coming as a result a parent saying I
 
01:18:44.510 --> 01:18:44.520 align:start position:0%
might work way over here in town X and
 
01:18:47.149 --> 01:18:47.159 align:start position:0%
that's one of the approved schools but
 
01:18:49.850 --> 01:18:49.860 align:start position:0%
over here in time why which is going the
 
01:18:52.130 --> 01:18:52.140 align:start position:0%
wrong direction and in high school you
 
01:18:54.470 --> 01:18:54.480 align:start position:0%
have to provide transportation I'd like
 
01:18:56.810 --> 01:18:56.820 align:start position:0%
to be able to go over to this school and
 
01:18:59.209 --> 01:18:59.219 align:start position:0%
transport my own child
 
01:19:01.610 --> 01:19:01.620 align:start position:0%
but what's happened is some of these
 
01:19:04.490 --> 01:19:04.500 align:start position:0%
receiving schools changed the amount of
 
01:19:06.890 --> 01:19:06.900 align:start position:0%
tuition as every District in the state
 
01:19:10.550 --> 01:19:10.560 align:start position:0%
does that the tuition costs are going up
 
01:19:12.169 --> 01:19:12.179 align:start position:0%
and if the average cost might be
 
01:19:14.270 --> 01:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
nineteen thousand dollars
 
01:19:18.530 --> 01:19:18.540 align:start position:0%
and family X here has one child already
 
01:19:21.050 --> 01:19:21.060 align:start position:0%
in that school system
 
01:19:23.030 --> 01:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
but three years to four years later
 
01:19:25.430 --> 01:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
another child comes along but in the
 
01:19:25.440 --> 01:19:26.510 align:start position:0%
another child comes along but in the
interim

01:19:26.510 --> 01:19:26.520 align:start position:0%
interim
 
01:19:29.149 --> 01:19:29.159 align:start position:0%
that receiving school has changed their
 
01:19:31.790 --> 01:19:31.800 align:start position:0%
tuition rate and it's now above the cap
 
01:19:34.250 --> 01:19:34.260 align:start position:0%
of the sending District the parents
 
01:19:36.590 --> 01:19:36.600 align:start position:0%
simply asking hey can I pay that
 
01:19:39.290 --> 01:19:39.300 align:start position:0%
difference to have my whole family going
 
01:19:41.689 --> 01:19:41.699 align:start position:0%
to the same location saving these
 
01:19:44.570 --> 01:19:44.580 align:start position:0%
Transportation costs where I work this
 
01:19:46.189 --> 01:19:46.199 align:start position:0%
is in fact happening in one of the
 
01:19:48.470 --> 01:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
districts which I represent and the
 
01:19:50.270 --> 01:19:50.280 align:start position:0%
other District the same issue is
 
01:19:52.010 --> 01:19:52.020 align:start position:0%
occurring so it's more than one school
 
01:19:54.590 --> 01:19:54.600 align:start position:0%
district that's encountering this in my
 
01:19:56.750 --> 01:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
district there's just two out of the
 
01:19:59.270 --> 01:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
five districts I represent what is it
 
01:20:00.890 --> 01:20:00.900 align:start position:0%
like in your District
 
01:20:02.689 --> 01:20:02.699 align:start position:0%
so what we're trying to do is
 
01:20:05.330 --> 01:20:05.340 align:start position:0%
accommodate students here
 
01:20:07.610 --> 01:20:07.620 align:start position:0%
some have also said well this is in the
 
01:20:10.070 --> 01:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
wrong area statutory language it's in
 
01:20:11.450 --> 01:20:11.460 align:start position:0%
the portion of deals with manifest
 
01:20:14.390 --> 01:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
educational hardship this is not a
 
01:20:16.970 --> 01:20:16.980 align:start position:0%
tuition program resulting upon
 
01:20:20.090 --> 01:20:20.100 align:start position:0%
a pervasive severe or persistent
 
01:20:22.130 --> 01:20:22.140 align:start position:0%
hardship the child's having in the given
 
01:20:24.649 --> 01:20:24.659 align:start position:0%
school this is a result of the sending
 
01:20:26.750 --> 01:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
school not having those grades in their
 
01:20:26.760 --> 01:20:28.430 align:start position:0%
school not having those grades in their
school

01:20:28.430 --> 01:20:28.440 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:20:31.669 --> 01:20:31.679 align:start position:0%
so there's real reason and causation for
 
01:20:34.310 --> 01:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
us to move forward with this area of
 
01:20:38.209 --> 01:20:38.219 align:start position:0%
statutory language and it is truly in
 
01:20:40.910 --> 01:20:40.920 align:start position:0%
the best interests of family and
 
01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:42.050 align:start position:0%
the best interests of family and
students

01:20:42.050 --> 01:20:42.060 align:start position:0%
students
 
01:20:44.870 --> 01:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
and our Workforce thank you very much
 
01:20:48.950 --> 01:20:48.960 align:start position:0%

share recognizes representative luno for

a parliamentary inquiry
 
01:22:07.729 --> 01:22:07.739 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:22:09.709 --> 01:22:09.719 align:start position:0%
if I know school districts that don't
 
01:22:12.410 --> 01:22:12.420 align:start position:0%
operate their own schools May contract
 
01:22:14.510 --> 01:22:14.520 align:start position:0%
with other public or private schools
 
01:22:17.149 --> 01:22:17.159 align:start position:0%
under a tuition agreement at noid
 
01:22:19.310 --> 01:22:19.320 align:start position:0%
additional cost to families
 
01:22:21.770 --> 01:22:21.780 align:start position:0%
but if I know that this bill mandates
 
01:22:24.530 --> 01:22:24.540 align:start position:0%
that all school districts establish
 
01:22:27.050 --> 01:22:27.060 align:start position:0%
tuition agreements with other public and
 
01:22:29.450 --> 01:22:29.460 align:start position:0%
private schools and that it could be
 
01:22:32.410 --> 01:22:32.420 align:start position:0%
holderness or Kua or Brewster Academy
 
01:22:35.689 --> 01:22:35.699 align:start position:0%
with some of the tuition paid by the
 
01:22:38.149 --> 01:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
local property taxpayers including
 
01:22:40.610 --> 01:22:40.620 align:start position:0%
seniors living on a fixed income
 
01:22:42.470 --> 01:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
and if I know that this isn't a good
 
01:22:45.950 --> 01:22:45.960 align:start position:0%
idea for kids families or taxpayers
 
01:22:47.930 --> 01:22:47.940 align:start position:0%
then what I press the red button and
 
01:22:49.910 --> 01:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
reject the conference report
 
01:22:51.950 --> 01:22:51.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker do you recognize
 
01:22:53.030 --> 01:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
your representative Ladd for a
 
01:22:54.770 --> 01:22:54.780 align:start position:0%
parliamentary inquiry
 
01:22:57.709 --> 01:22:57.719 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker if I know this bill
 
01:23:00.050 --> 01:23:00.060 align:start position:0%
provides that a parent May pay the
 
01:23:02.510 --> 01:23:02.520 align:start position:0%
difference between a receiving school's
 
01:23:05.209 --> 01:23:05.219 align:start position:0%
tuition cost and then sending District
 
01:23:08.990 --> 01:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
tuition cap as long as the parent has at
 
01:23:12.350 --> 01:23:12.360 align:start position:0%
least one other enrollment option that
 
01:23:15.169 --> 01:23:15.179 align:start position:0%
is an approved public school or public
 
01:23:19.189 --> 01:23:19.199 align:start position:0%
Academy at no cost to the parent
 
01:23:21.410 --> 01:23:21.420 align:start position:0%
and if I know a school approved as a
 
01:23:24.169 --> 01:23:24.179 align:start position:0%
tuition program School must be approved
 
01:23:26.810 --> 01:23:26.820 align:start position:0%
and contracted by the local public
 
01:23:29.510 --> 01:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
school board and must provide an
 
01:23:31.910 --> 01:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity for an adequate education
 
01:23:35.209 --> 01:23:35.219 align:start position:0%
and if I further know this Common Sense
 
01:23:37.850 --> 01:23:37.860 align:start position:0%
Bill enables local boards to better
 
01:23:40.790 --> 01:23:40.800 align:start position:0%
accommodate unique family scheduling

on House Bill 315.
 
01:26:11.930 --> 01:26:11.940 align:start position:0%
as it sometimes happens
 
01:26:14.390 --> 01:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
they who shall not be mentioned
 
01:26:16.370 --> 01:26:16.380 align:start position:0%
just can't help but start tinkering with
 
01:26:19.970 --> 01:26:19.980 align:start position:0%
a bill that is very well written
 
01:26:21.950 --> 01:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
and that's what caused this house to
 
01:26:25.790 --> 01:26:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:28.129 --> 01:26:28.139 align:start position:0%
after it was changed by those
 
01:26:30.770 --> 01:26:30.780 align:start position:0%
Who Remain unnamed
 
01:26:33.830 --> 01:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
currently in New Hampshire an unwanted
 
01:26:35.930 --> 01:26:35.940 align:start position:0%
sexual Advance would not need to be
 
01:26:35.940 --> 01:26:38.450 align:start position:0%
sexual Advance would not need to be
forcible

01:26:38.450 --> 01:26:38.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:41.390 --> 01:26:41.400 align:start position:0%
for it to count as provocation
 
01:26:44.570 --> 01:26:44.580 align:start position:0%
with the CFC text as presented a man
 
01:26:46.790 --> 01:26:46.800 align:start position:0%
would need to physically lay hands on a
 
01:26:49.729 --> 01:26:49.739 align:start position:0%
woman before she could cite in a trial
 
01:26:53.209 --> 01:26:53.219 align:start position:0%
his unwanted sexual advances as
 
01:26:53.219 --> 01:26:55.729 align:start position:0%
his unwanted sexual advances as
provocation

01:26:55.729 --> 01:26:55.739 align:start position:0%
provocation
 
01:26:58.550 --> 01:26:58.560 align:start position:0%
some people may say that the CHC Bill
 
01:27:01.850 --> 01:27:01.860 align:start position:0%
does not limit in any way a person's
 
01:27:04.910 --> 01:27:04.920 align:start position:0%
ability to make a claim of self-defense
 
01:27:07.430 --> 01:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
except that is exactly what the Sea of C
 
01:27:09.229 --> 01:27:09.239 align:start position:0%
Bill does
 
01:27:12.050 --> 01:27:12.060 align:start position:0%
I say that if we accept and pass the CFC
 
01:27:12.060 --> 01:27:13.070 align:start position:0%
I say that if we accept and pass the CFC
report

01:27:13.070 --> 01:27:13.080 align:start position:0%
report
 
01:27:14.930 --> 01:27:14.940 align:start position:0%
a woman would not be able to cite
 
01:27:17.629 --> 01:27:17.639 align:start position:0%
unwanted sexual harassment as a
 
01:27:20.450 --> 01:27:20.460 align:start position:0%
provocation was she to kill a man and be
 
01:27:22.129 --> 01:27:22.139 align:start position:0%
tried for murder
 
01:27:24.649 --> 01:27:24.659 align:start position:0%
unless the man actually used physical
 
01:27:27.530 --> 01:27:27.540 align:start position:0%
force on her
 
01:27:29.810 --> 01:27:29.820 align:start position:0%
the CFC states that they carefully
 
01:27:31.490 --> 01:27:31.500 align:start position:0%
crafted the language
 
01:27:36.950 --> 01:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:39.290 --> 01:27:39.300 align:start position:0%
from being used in New Hampshire
 
01:27:41.689 --> 01:27:41.699 align:start position:0%
which of course the gay Panic defense
 
01:27:44.750 --> 01:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
has never been used in New Hampshire
 
01:27:47.990 --> 01:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
and for the CFC to offer protection from
 
01:27:51.110 --> 01:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
the non-existent gay Panic defense
 
01:27:53.209 --> 01:27:53.219 align:start position:0%
they have created a situation where a
 
01:27:55.370 --> 01:27:55.380 align:start position:0%
woman must wait for a predator to
 
01:27:57.530 --> 01:27:57.540 align:start position:0%
physically lay hands on her before the
 
01:27:59.689 --> 01:27:59.699 align:start position:0%
woman can respond with protective
 
01:27:59.699 --> 01:28:01.610 align:start position:0%
woman can respond with protective
violence

01:28:01.610 --> 01:28:01.620 align:start position:0%
violence
 
01:28:03.590 --> 01:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
they have created that
 
01:28:05.689 --> 01:28:05.699 align:start position:0%
by inserting that a woman can't claim
 
01:28:07.750 --> 01:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
extreme provocation and I quote
 
01:28:10.910 --> 01:28:10.920 align:start position:0%
including in circumstances in which the
 
01:28:13.970 --> 01:28:13.980 align:start position:0%
victim made an unforceable romantic or
 
01:28:17.570 --> 01:28:17.580 align:start position:0%
sexual Advance towards the defendant
 
01:28:20.209 --> 01:28:20.219 align:start position:0%
there are many circumstances under which
 
01:28:23.750 --> 01:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
provocation could be very severe
 
01:28:27.290 --> 01:28:27.300 align:start position:0%
without involving physical Force
 
01:28:30.290 --> 01:28:30.300 align:start position:0%
if the CFC had wanted to ensure that
 
01:28:31.790 --> 01:28:31.800 align:start position:0%
this bill accomplished its original
 
01:28:34.490 --> 01:28:34.500 align:start position:0%
attempt then I believe what the Sea of C
 
01:28:37.610 --> 01:28:37.620 align:start position:0%
should have done was pass the bill as it
 
01:28:40.430 --> 01:28:40.440 align:start position:0%
was written when this house passed 315
 
01:28:43.729 --> 01:28:43.739 align:start position:0%
on a unanimous Voice vote
 
01:28:46.790 --> 01:28:46.800 align:start position:0%
back in March back in March
 
01:28:49.129 --> 01:28:49.139 align:start position:0%
I asked you to please vote no on the sea
 
01:28:52.850 --> 01:28:52.860 align:start position:0%
of C I request a roll call vote thank
 
01:28:54.590 --> 01:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
you Mr Speaker
 
01:28:56.689 --> 01:28:56.699 align:start position:0%
chair recognize your Belcher to speak
 
01:29:07.870 --> 01:29:07.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:15.169 --> 01:29:15.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:17.750 --> 01:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker colleagues I rise
 
01:29:19.310 --> 01:29:19.320 align:start position:0%
in support of the committee of
 
01:29:22.250 --> 01:29:22.260 align:start position:0%
conference report on this as you may
 
01:29:24.169 --> 01:29:24.179 align:start position:0%
recall I had a problem with an earlier
 
01:29:27.169 --> 01:29:27.179 align:start position:0%
version of of the bill because of of
 
01:29:29.510 --> 01:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
certain language in the one particular
 
01:29:31.669 --> 01:29:31.679 align:start position:0%
Clause of the bill that seemed to me
 
01:29:33.530 --> 01:29:33.540 align:start position:0%
created the potential for unintended
 
01:29:35.750 --> 01:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
consequences the committee report
 
01:29:38.510 --> 01:29:38.520 align:start position:0%
completely eliminates that possibility
 
01:29:40.129 --> 01:29:40.139 align:start position:0%
there's there will be no unintended
 
01:29:42.950 --> 01:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
consequences the language has been
 
01:29:46.510 --> 01:29:46.520 align:start position:0%
changed in an important way I have to
 
01:29:48.950 --> 01:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
strongly disagree with the prior speaker
 
01:29:53.629 --> 01:29:53.639 align:start position:0%
this this bill has nothing to do with
 
01:29:56.629 --> 01:29:56.639 align:start position:0%
self-defense provocation is something
 
01:29:59.930 --> 01:29:59.940 align:start position:0%
that is a mitigator when some this this
 
01:30:02.570 --> 01:30:02.580 align:start position:0%
bill applies to one circumstance
 
01:30:05.450 --> 01:30:05.460 align:start position:0%
somebody is charged with murder
 
01:30:09.110 --> 01:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
and they assert not self-defense as a
 
01:30:11.450 --> 01:30:11.460 align:start position:0%
defense but they assert what's known as
 
01:30:15.229 --> 01:30:15.239 align:start position:0%
provocation not to have not to say that
 
01:30:18.290 --> 01:30:18.300 align:start position:0%
I'm not guilty but that I'm guilty of a
 
01:30:21.470 --> 01:30:21.480 align:start position:0%
lesser inclu of a lesser offense so that
 
01:30:23.629 --> 01:30:23.639 align:start position:0%
instead of murder which carries a life
 
01:30:25.669 --> 01:30:25.679 align:start position:0%
of potential sense of life imprisonment
 
01:30:28.250 --> 01:30:28.260 align:start position:0%
I'm guilty of manslaughter which would
 
01:30:31.070 --> 01:30:31.080 align:start position:0%
make the maximum spend sentence only 30
 
01:30:33.470 --> 01:30:33.480 align:start position:0%
years still a very serious offense but
 
01:30:35.689 --> 01:30:35.699 align:start position:0%
less than murder that's the only
 
01:30:37.970 --> 01:30:37.980 align:start position:0%
circumstance that this bill applies to
 
01:30:40.790 --> 01:30:40.800 align:start position:0%
it has nothing whatsoever to do with
 
01:30:43.790 --> 01:30:43.800 align:start position:0%
self-defense and what this bill says in
 
01:30:43.800 --> 01:30:44.750 align:start position:0%
self-defense and what this bill says in
effect

01:30:44.750 --> 01:30:44.760 align:start position:0%
effect
 
01:30:48.709 --> 01:30:48.719 align:start position:0%
is you can't say if you're charged with
 
01:30:50.149 --> 01:30:50.159 align:start position:0%
murder that is you've killed some
 
01:30:52.490 --> 01:30:52.500 align:start position:0%
someone is dead let's make I make under
 
01:30:53.750 --> 01:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
make clear what we're talking about
 
01:30:56.090 --> 01:30:56.100 align:start position:0%
someone is dead and you're charged with
 
01:30:58.850 --> 01:30:58.860 align:start position:0%
murdering that person and you can't say
 
01:31:00.290 --> 01:31:00.300 align:start position:0%
to the jury
 
01:31:00.300 --> 01:31:01.850 align:start position:0%
to the jury
listen

01:31:01.850 --> 01:31:01.860 align:start position:0%
listen
 
01:31:04.669 --> 01:31:04.679 align:start position:0%
find me guilty of a lesser offense
 
01:31:08.090 --> 01:31:08.100 align:start position:0%
because the person that I killed in a
 
01:31:10.970 --> 01:31:10.980 align:start position:0%
sense is less worthy that's the claim
 
01:31:13.010 --> 01:31:13.020 align:start position:0%
the person I killed is less worthy
 
01:31:17.050 --> 01:31:17.060 align:start position:0%
because he or she is gay or transgender
 
01:31:20.030 --> 01:31:20.040 align:start position:0%
or or something like that can you
 
01:31:22.370 --> 01:31:22.380 align:start position:0%
imagine that that it should be all right
 
01:31:25.610 --> 01:31:25.620 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire to say it was okay I'm
 
01:31:28.430 --> 01:31:28.440 align:start position:0%
guilty for a lesser offense because the
 
01:31:30.169 --> 01:31:30.179 align:start position:0%
person I killed because of the gender
 
01:31:32.930 --> 01:31:32.940 align:start position:0%
identity of someone I killed that seems
 
01:31:35.570 --> 01:31:35.580 align:start position:0%
to me it's outrageous this is this bill
 
01:31:39.229 --> 01:31:39.239 align:start position:0%
makes perfect sense I urge the Comm the
 
01:31:41.270 --> 01:31:41.280 align:start position:0%
the body to adopt the committee of
 
01:31:43.490 --> 01:31:43.500 align:start position:0%
conference report thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:31:50.570 --> 01:31:50.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:52.070 --> 01:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker and good morning
 
01:31:52.080 --> 01:31:54.590 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker and good morning
colleagues

01:31:54.590 --> 01:31:54.600 align:start position:0%
colleagues
 
01:31:57.649 --> 01:31:57.659 align:start position:0%
I'll be absolutely honest in that I
 
01:32:01.129 --> 01:32:01.139 align:start position:0%
didn't fully understand the predominant
 
01:32:01.139 --> 01:32:02.450 align:start position:0%
didn't fully understand the predominant
argument

01:32:02.450 --> 01:32:02.460 align:start position:0%
argument
 
01:32:04.669 --> 01:32:04.679 align:start position:0%
against this bill
 
01:32:06.890 --> 01:32:06.900 align:start position:0%
but I have a very different one and I
 
01:32:09.290 --> 01:32:09.300 align:start position:0%
see a different problem
 
01:32:12.110 --> 01:32:12.120 align:start position:0%
our justice system was established in
 
01:32:14.270 --> 01:32:14.280 align:start position:0%
such a manner as the place an immense
 
01:32:16.430 --> 01:32:16.440 align:start position:0%
degree of trust
 
01:32:16.440 --> 01:32:18.530 align:start position:0%
degree of trust
injuries

01:32:18.530 --> 01:32:18.540 align:start position:0%
injuries
 
01:32:20.750 --> 01:32:20.760 align:start position:0%
our system was established such that
 
01:32:24.530 --> 01:32:24.540 align:start position:0%
juries can even nullify a law
 
01:32:27.229 --> 01:32:27.239 align:start position:0%
if they believe that an injustice
 
01:32:29.209 --> 01:32:29.219 align:start position:0%
is being done
 
01:32:32.030 --> 01:32:32.040 align:start position:0%
our system was set up such that it would
 
01:32:34.250 --> 01:32:34.260 align:start position:0%
prefer to see 100
 
01:32:37.129 --> 01:32:37.139 align:start position:0%
guilty men go free rather than one
 
01:32:40.850 --> 01:32:40.860 align:start position:0%
innocent man be imprisoned
 
01:32:45.110 --> 01:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
now nobody likes the idea that a bigoted
 
01:32:49.669 --> 01:32:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:52.910 --> 01:32:52.920 align:start position:0%
but because something happened in
 
01:32:54.169 --> 01:32:54.179 align:start position:0%
another state
 
01:32:56.090 --> 01:32:56.100 align:start position:0%
decades ago
 
01:32:59.570 --> 01:32:59.580 align:start position:0%
does not justify us putting our thumbs
 
01:33:03.830 --> 01:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
on the scale of Justice by prohibiting
 
01:33:08.629 --> 01:33:08.639 align:start position:0%
what a jury may be allowed to hear
 
01:33:11.870 --> 01:33:11.880 align:start position:0%
this bill demolishes the arguments for a
 
01:33:15.110 --> 01:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
trustworthy and impartial jury it
 
01:33:17.930 --> 01:33:17.940 align:start position:0%
assumes that the presence of bigotry
 
01:33:20.270 --> 01:33:20.280 align:start position:0%
will taint Justice
 
01:33:22.790 --> 01:33:22.800 align:start position:0%
and in so doing it becomes a slippery
 
01:33:22.800 --> 01:33:23.810 align:start position:0%
and in so doing it becomes a slippery
slope

01:33:23.810 --> 01:33:23.820 align:start position:0%
slope
 
01:33:26.090 --> 01:33:26.100 align:start position:0%
toward further restrictions on what a
 
01:33:28.250 --> 01:33:28.260 align:start position:0%
jury may be allowed to hear
 
01:33:32.149 --> 01:33:32.159 align:start position:0%
I ask you to trust New Hampshire
 
01:33:36.590 --> 01:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
citizens to render impartial Justice
 
01:33:39.830 --> 01:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
and vote no on this thank you
 
01:33:42.110 --> 01:33:42.120 align:start position:0%
I recognize representative Roy speak to
 
01:33:48.169 --> 01:33:48.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:49.970 --> 01:33:49.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:33:51.890 --> 01:33:51.900 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker
 
01:33:53.750 --> 01:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to clarify what this bill
 
01:33:55.610 --> 01:33:55.620 align:start position:0%
does and does not do because it sounds
 
01:33:58.189 --> 01:33:58.199 align:start position:0%
like it's gotten very confusing
 
01:34:03.229 --> 01:34:03.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:06.169 --> 01:34:06.179 align:start position:0%
someone kills someone
 
01:34:08.629 --> 01:34:08.639 align:start position:0%
they get to court they are charged with
 
01:34:08.639 --> 01:34:10.610 align:start position:0%
they get to court they are charged with
murder

01:34:10.610 --> 01:34:10.620 align:start position:0%
murder
 
01:34:13.970 --> 01:34:13.980 align:start position:0%
they wish to make the argument to the
 
01:34:16.750 --> 01:34:16.760 align:start position:0%
jury that the jury should find them
 
01:34:19.970 --> 01:34:19.980 align:start position:0%
guilty of manslaughter versus guilty of
 
01:34:22.910 --> 01:34:22.920 align:start position:0%
murder and the theory they wish to
 
01:34:26.149 --> 01:34:26.159 align:start position:0%
present to the jury is jury
 
01:34:28.430 --> 01:34:28.440 align:start position:0%
find me guilty of manslaughter instead
 
01:34:31.250 --> 01:34:31.260 align:start position:0%
of murder because the person I killed is
 
01:34:34.490 --> 01:34:34.500 align:start position:0%
gay and therefore it should be okay
 
01:34:37.129 --> 01:34:37.139 align:start position:0%
that is all that this does it has
 
01:34:38.990 --> 01:34:39.000 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with self-defense it has
 
01:34:41.030 --> 01:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with women being hit on
 
01:34:46.250 --> 01:34:46.260 align:start position:0%
it's simply I killed someone and I wish
 
01:34:49.189 --> 01:34:49.199 align:start position:0%
to tell the jury please find me guilty
 
01:34:51.290 --> 01:34:51.300 align:start position:0%
of manslaughter and not murder because
 
01:34:53.750 --> 01:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
the person I killed is transgender and
 
01:34:56.110 --> 01:34:56.120 align:start position:0%
therefore it should be okay to kill them
 
01:34:59.629 --> 01:34:59.639 align:start position:0%
that's all this bill would ban it would
 
01:35:02.570 --> 01:35:02.580 align:start position:0%
ban someone from making that argument to
 
01:35:04.189 --> 01:35:04.199 align:start position:0%
a jury
 
01:35:07.189 --> 01:35:07.199 align:start position:0%
now whether or not you agree we should
 
01:35:09.229 --> 01:35:09.239 align:start position:0%
be banning certain defenses to juries or
 
01:35:10.669 --> 01:35:10.679 align:start position:0%
not I leave that to your personal
 
01:35:13.970 --> 01:35:13.980 align:start position:0%
conscience but I'm clarifying what the
 
01:35:16.729 --> 01:35:16.739 align:start position:0%
bill does and does not do it is very
 
01:35:19.550 --> 01:35:19.560 align:start position:0%
limited to just that situation
 
01:35:22.430 --> 01:35:22.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:35:24.590 --> 01:35:24.600 align:start position:0%
Senator has called for a roll call us
 
01:35:28.070 --> 01:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:31.970 --> 01:35:31.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:33.890 --> 01:35:33.900 align:start position:0%
the division has been called for this
 
01:35:35.750 --> 01:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
will be a division vote members take
 
01:36:36.850 --> 01:36:36.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:39.350 --> 01:36:39.360 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is occur on House
 
01:36:42.410 --> 01:36:42.420 align:start position:0%
Bill 315 this is a division vote
 
01:36:44.510 --> 01:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
chair recognized represent filio for a
 
01:36:46.490 --> 01:36:46.500 align:start position:0%
parliamentary inquiry
 
01:36:52.070 --> 01:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:53.689 --> 01:36:53.699 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:36:56.510 --> 01:36:56.520 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know that the committee
 
01:36:58.729 --> 01:36:58.739 align:start position:0%
of conference recommendation only
 
01:37:01.689 --> 01:37:01.699 align:start position:0%
applies to RSA
 
01:37:05.149 --> 01:37:05.159 align:start position:0%
632 which is the manslaughter section
 
01:37:07.850 --> 01:37:07.860 align:start position:0%
dealing with provocation and does not
 
01:37:12.350 --> 01:37:12.360 align:start position:0%
deal with RSA 6274 which is the
 
01:37:14.209 --> 01:37:14.219 align:start position:0%
self-defense statute and therefore
 
01:37:17.209 --> 01:37:17.219 align:start position:0%
leaves the right to self-defense in
 
01:37:20.169 --> 01:37:20.179 align:start position:0%
place regardless of the arguments today
 
01:37:23.810 --> 01:37:23.820 align:start position:0%
and if I also know that the committee of
 
01:37:26.590 --> 01:37:26.600 align:start position:0%
conference report uses the words because
 
01:37:29.930 --> 01:37:29.940 align:start position:0%
of therefore meaning that the argument
 
01:37:32.689 --> 01:37:32.699 align:start position:0%
in the committee of conference report
 
01:37:35.270 --> 01:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
can only be used if the defendant is
 
01:37:39.410 --> 01:37:39.420 align:start position:0%
arguing provocation because of sex
 
01:37:42.050 --> 01:37:42.060 align:start position:0%
gender sexual orientation or gender
 
01:37:46.010 --> 01:37:46.020 align:start position:0%
identity and if I also know that the gay
 
01:37:48.890 --> 01:37:48.900 align:start position:0%
Panic defense is used every year
 
01:37:51.890 --> 01:37:51.900 align:start position:0%
Nationwide and succeeds about a third of
 
01:37:54.709 --> 01:37:54.719 align:start position:0%
the time and finally if I know the New
 
01:37:56.570 --> 01:37:56.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire way is to deal with problems
 
01:38:00.110 --> 01:38:00.120 align:start position:0%
head on proactively and not reactively
 
01:38:04.070 --> 01:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
do I then press the green button for the
 
01:38:05.930 --> 01:38:05.940 align:start position:0%
committee of conference report to put
 
01:38:08.149 --> 01:38:08.159 align:start position:0%
the gay Panic defense where it belongs
 
01:38:10.970 --> 01:38:10.980 align:start position:0%
in the history books not the law books
 
01:38:13.550 --> 01:38:13.560 align:start position:0%

01:40:34.910 --> 01:40:34.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr Speaker
 
01:40:37.490 --> 01:40:37.500 align:start position:0%
House Bill 536 passed this chamber with
 
01:40:40.910 --> 01:40:40.920 align:start position:0%
a strong bipartisan vote it was a good
 
01:40:43.310 --> 01:40:43.320 align:start position:0%
bill but the other chamber amended it
 
01:40:45.830 --> 01:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
and messed it up I signed off on the
 
01:40:49.070 --> 01:40:49.080 align:start position:0%
conference report only because it made
 
01:40:52.070 --> 01:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
the bill a little less bad but it's
 
01:40:55.129 --> 01:40:55.139 align:start position:0%
still bad and it's bad State policy that
 
01:40:57.350 --> 01:40:57.360 align:start position:0%
mandates the public school district sell
 
01:40:59.990 --> 01:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
an unused taxpayer-owned school facility
 
01:41:02.270 --> 01:41:02.280 align:start position:0%
to a privately owned Charter School
 
01:41:05.450 --> 01:41:05.460 align:start position:0%
against the will of the locally elected
 
01:41:07.189 --> 01:41:07.199 align:start position:0%
School Board
 
01:41:09.590 --> 01:41:09.600 align:start position:0%
it's nothing short of a mandate to sell
 
01:41:11.930 --> 01:41:11.940 align:start position:0%
taxpayer on property to a private
 
01:41:11.940 --> 01:41:13.610 align:start position:0%
taxpayer on property to a private
company

01:41:13.610 --> 01:41:13.620 align:start position:0%
company
 
01:41:15.830 --> 01:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
proponents talk about problems with the
 
01:41:16.970 --> 01:41:16.980 align:start position:0%
current law
 
01:41:19.189 --> 01:41:19.199 align:start position:0%
but examples they cite
 
01:41:21.229 --> 01:41:21.239 align:start position:0%
and that I work ended up working out
 
01:41:22.370 --> 01:41:22.380 align:start position:0%
just fine
 
01:41:24.169 --> 01:41:24.179 align:start position:0%
with the charter school buying of the
 
01:41:27.290 --> 01:41:27.300 align:start position:0%
unused facility no problem here the
 
01:41:30.169 --> 01:41:30.179 align:start position:0%
existing law works as intended
 
01:41:32.330 --> 01:41:32.340 align:start position:0%
but with this bill the commissioner of
 
01:41:35.270 --> 01:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
Education sets the market price
 
01:41:37.609 --> 01:41:37.619 align:start position:0%
and if there are no other offers the
 
01:41:41.090 --> 01:41:41.100 align:start position:0%
locally elected School Board must sell
 
01:41:43.850 --> 01:41:43.860 align:start position:0%
the public property to a privately owned
 
01:41:46.129 --> 01:41:46.139 align:start position:0%
charter school for that Marketplace for
 
01:41:49.430 --> 01:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
that market price or less
 
01:41:54.189 --> 01:41:54.199 align:start position:0%
think on that one or less how much less
 
01:41:58.430 --> 01:41:58.440 align:start position:0%
taxpayers paid for the land paid for the
 
01:41:58.440 --> 01:41:59.390 align:start position:0%
taxpayers paid for the land paid for the
building

01:41:59.390 --> 01:41:59.400 align:start position:0%
building
 
01:42:02.270 --> 01:42:02.280 align:start position:0%
paid to maintain the building paid to
 
01:42:04.550 --> 01:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
renovate the building over the years
 
01:42:06.470 --> 01:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
they'd want to know
 
01:42:09.229 --> 01:42:09.239 align:start position:0%
they'd want to know how much less than
 
01:42:11.209 --> 01:42:11.219 align:start position:0%
fair market value they're going to get
 
01:42:14.209 --> 01:42:14.219 align:start position:0%
for their public property
 
01:42:16.189 --> 01:42:16.199 align:start position:0%
maybe just a dollar
 
01:42:18.530 --> 01:42:18.540 align:start position:0%
and with no other offers the privately
 
01:42:20.149 --> 01:42:20.159 align:start position:0%
owned business gets to buy the
 
01:42:23.390 --> 01:42:23.400 align:start position:0%
taxpayer-owned property for a buck done
 
01:42:23.400 --> 01:42:25.250 align:start position:0%
taxpayer-owned property for a buck done
deal

01:42:25.250 --> 01:42:25.260 align:start position:0%
deal
 
01:42:26.810 --> 01:42:26.820 align:start position:0%
maybe the school district took the
 
01:42:28.970 --> 01:42:28.980 align:start position:0%
building offline for a temporary decline
 
01:42:30.350 --> 01:42:30.360 align:start position:0%
in enrollment
 
01:42:33.169 --> 01:42:33.179 align:start position:0%
or maybe to renovate or maybe other
 
01:42:35.870 --> 01:42:35.880 align:start position:0%
reasons like an interest in using it for
 
01:42:38.450 --> 01:42:38.460 align:start position:0%
other community purposes maybe a
 
01:42:40.850 --> 01:42:40.860 align:start position:0%
community center or a senior center or
 
01:42:43.250 --> 01:42:43.260 align:start position:0%
an alternative high school maybe the
 
01:42:44.570 --> 01:42:44.580 align:start position:0%
school board is waiting for the window
 
01:42:46.910 --> 01:42:46.920 align:start position:0%
of opportunity to apply for State
 
01:42:49.370 --> 01:42:49.380 align:start position:0%
Building Aid Grant and that could be
 
01:42:51.410 --> 01:42:51.420 align:start position:0%
several years out
 
01:42:53.149 --> 01:42:53.159 align:start position:0%
but the commissioner of Education could
 
01:42:55.250 --> 01:42:55.260 align:start position:0%
sell the building for a buck
 
01:42:57.649 --> 01:42:57.659 align:start position:0%
think this won't happen just look what
 
01:42:59.750 --> 01:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
happened recently in tuftonborough where
 
01:43:02.090 --> 01:43:02.100 align:start position:0%
historic public building was sold to an
 
01:43:04.609 --> 01:43:04.619 align:start position:0%
Evangelical private charter school for
 
01:43:06.410 --> 01:43:06.420 align:start position:0%
just one dollar
 
01:43:08.810 --> 01:43:08.820 align:start position:0%
it's happened it's part of the grand
 
01:43:11.030 --> 01:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
plan to destroy public schools and
 
01:43:13.270 --> 01:43:13.280 align:start position:0%
decimate the strong best in the country
 
01:43:15.830 --> 01:43:15.840 align:start position:0%
reputation New Hampshire has long been
 
01:43:16.910 --> 01:43:16.920 align:start position:0%
known for
 
01:43:19.250 --> 01:43:19.260 align:start position:0%
please don't lest the extremist pop
 
01:43:21.770 --> 01:43:21.780 align:start position:0%
propaganda house will be in order lead
 
01:43:24.050 --> 01:43:24.060 align:start position:0%
you to turn your backs on your friends
 
01:43:26.510 --> 01:43:26.520 align:start position:0%
and neighbors I'm sure they'll want to
 
01:43:29.330 --> 01:43:29.340 align:start position:0%
know who sold them out for a buck thank
 
01:43:31.010 --> 01:43:31.020 align:start position:0%
you Mr Speaker and I requested division
 
01:43:31.020 --> 01:43:34.970 align:start position:0%
you Mr Speaker and I requested division
vote

01:43:34.970 --> 01:43:34.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:36.890 --> 01:43:36.900 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative Vlad to
 
01:43:40.669 --> 01:43:40.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:42.530 --> 01:43:42.540 align:start position:0%
I think once again it's time to get our
 
01:43:45.470 --> 01:43:45.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:47.629 --> 01:43:47.639 align:start position:0%
in looking at the amending language
 
01:43:49.850 --> 01:43:49.860 align:start position:0%
which is in this bill right now it says
 
01:43:52.189 --> 01:43:52.199 align:start position:0%
if no agreement is reached the
 
01:43:53.450 --> 01:43:53.460 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the Department of
 
01:43:57.169 --> 01:43:57.179 align:start position:0%
Education shall engage an independent
 
01:43:57.179 --> 01:43:59.090 align:start position:0%
Education shall engage an independent
mediator

01:43:59.090 --> 01:43:59.100 align:start position:0%
mediator
 
01:44:01.070 --> 01:44:01.080 align:start position:0%
so that the commissioner's not making
 
01:44:02.990 --> 01:44:03.000 align:start position:0%
this decision
 
01:44:05.930 --> 01:44:05.940 align:start position:0%
it's made by a mediator
 
01:44:07.910 --> 01:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
and what we have here let's start right
 
01:44:09.890 --> 01:44:09.900 align:start position:0%
from the very beginning when we're
 
01:44:12.530 --> 01:44:12.540 align:start position:0%
talking about these vacant schools
 
01:44:14.330 --> 01:44:14.340 align:start position:0%
all over this country because our
 
01:44:16.609 --> 01:44:16.619 align:start position:0%
demographics are certainly dropping like
 
01:44:21.350 --> 01:44:21.360 align:start position:0%
a lead balloon here from 220 210 000
 
01:44:23.870 --> 01:44:23.880 align:start position:0%
kids when I first got in this joint and
 
01:44:27.350 --> 01:44:27.360 align:start position:0%
now down to 161 000 kids Statewide we
 
01:44:29.629 --> 01:44:29.639 align:start position:0%
have empty buildings out there and those
 
01:44:32.810 --> 01:44:32.820 align:start position:0%
buildings have been maintained by public
 
01:44:35.390 --> 01:44:35.400 align:start position:0%
dollars all along the way
 
01:44:38.209 --> 01:44:38.219 align:start position:0%
in fact some were built that way
 
01:44:40.850 --> 01:44:40.860 align:start position:0%
and when we have a vacant School
 
01:44:42.950 --> 01:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
and as an administrator you sit there
 
01:44:45.290 --> 01:44:45.300 align:start position:0%
looking at this vacant structure falling
 
01:44:47.090 --> 01:44:47.100 align:start position:0%
apart because what are you doing you're
 
01:44:48.770 --> 01:44:48.780 align:start position:0%
deferring maintenance
 
01:44:50.149 --> 01:44:50.159 align:start position:0%
that's going to go to the schools to
 
01:44:51.590 --> 01:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
have the kids in
 
01:44:53.330 --> 01:44:53.340 align:start position:0%
and so the building the value of that
 
01:44:54.950 --> 01:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
building keeps dropping and dropping and
 
01:44:54.960 --> 01:44:56.149 align:start position:0%
building keeps dropping and dropping and
dropping

01:44:56.149 --> 01:44:56.159 align:start position:0%
dropping
 
01:44:58.310 --> 01:44:58.320 align:start position:0%
so we have legislation in place right
 
01:44:58.320 --> 01:45:00.050 align:start position:0%
so we have legislation in place right
now

01:45:00.050 --> 01:45:00.060 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:45:02.450 --> 01:45:02.460 align:start position:0%
where these vacant schools can be put on
 
01:45:05.510 --> 01:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
the market with the option of first
 
01:45:07.910 --> 01:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
that's going to offer a purchase price
 
01:45:10.070 --> 01:45:10.080 align:start position:0%
or at least would be a Charter Public
 
01:45:13.490 --> 01:45:13.500 align:start position:0%
School wow what an Innovative idea
 
01:45:16.370 --> 01:45:16.380 align:start position:0%
have public school kids going back to a
 
01:45:18.590 --> 01:45:18.600 align:start position:0%
public school that's been closed because
 
01:45:21.410 --> 01:45:21.420 align:start position:0%
public school kids are in charter
 
01:45:24.950 --> 01:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
schools let's not forget that
 
01:45:27.109 --> 01:45:27.119 align:start position:0%
so what this bill does it puts a
 
01:45:28.729 --> 01:45:28.739 align:start position:0%
timeline in which the negotiation
 
01:45:30.709 --> 01:45:30.719 align:start position:0%
process goes on
 
01:45:34.010 --> 01:45:34.020 align:start position:0%
fine everybody agrees to that in fact
 
01:45:36.350 --> 01:45:36.360 align:start position:0%
everybody on the committee at conference
 
01:45:36.360 --> 01:45:38.090 align:start position:0%
everybody on the committee at conference
agreed

01:45:38.090 --> 01:45:38.100 align:start position:0%
agreed
 
01:45:40.490 --> 01:45:40.500 align:start position:0%
to this report
 
01:45:44.270 --> 01:45:44.280 align:start position:0%
now I hear we don't agree
 
01:45:48.169 --> 01:45:48.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:50.870 --> 01:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
it's a little less better or whatever
 
01:45:52.970 --> 01:45:52.980 align:start position:0%
was said
 
01:45:56.510 --> 01:45:56.520 align:start position:0%
I I feel that at this point in time once
 
01:46:02.030 --> 01:46:02.040 align:start position:0%
the mediator offers a free market price
 
01:46:04.129 --> 01:46:04.139 align:start position:0%
he's not telling it that we took out
 
01:46:08.450 --> 01:46:08.460 align:start position:0%
where it has to be accepted or rejected
 
01:46:11.990 --> 01:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
just offers a free market price
 
01:46:15.890 --> 01:46:15.900 align:start position:0%
for leasing or purchasing that facility
 
01:46:18.530 --> 01:46:18.540 align:start position:0%
so the bottom line on this bill is that
 
01:46:21.290 --> 01:46:21.300 align:start position:0%
we want to use these buildings
 
01:46:24.770 --> 01:46:24.780 align:start position:0%
for public school kids
 
01:46:27.950 --> 01:46:27.960 align:start position:0%
regardless of where you live
 
01:46:31.310 --> 01:46:31.320 align:start position:0%
there are students in this state
 
01:46:33.770 --> 01:46:33.780 align:start position:0%
that are taking advantage of the options
 
01:46:36.890 --> 01:46:36.900 align:start position:0%
and the programming that are available
 
01:46:38.930 --> 01:46:38.940 align:start position:0%
due to a number of reasons I won't go
 
01:46:40.370 --> 01:46:40.380 align:start position:0%
through all the variables and all the
 
01:46:42.530 --> 01:46:42.540 align:start position:0%
issues of why children choose Charter
 
01:46:45.050 --> 01:46:45.060 align:start position:0%
Schools but just please remember they
 
01:46:47.090 --> 01:46:47.100 align:start position:0%
are public schools and we should be
 
01:46:49.970 --> 01:46:49.980 align:start position:0%
using them a vacant School falls apart
 
01:46:51.709 --> 01:46:51.719 align:start position:0%
I can understand a school district
 
01:46:53.330 --> 01:46:53.340 align:start position:0%
that's going to use the building in case
 
01:46:55.129 --> 01:46:55.139 align:start position:0%
they know they have another facility is
 
01:46:56.750 --> 01:46:56.760 align:start position:0%
falling apart and they're going to have
 
01:46:58.370 --> 01:46:58.380 align:start position:0%
to move the kids in there while we fix
 
01:47:00.590 --> 01:47:00.600 align:start position:0%
the roof for whatever for a year that's
 
01:47:03.350 --> 01:47:03.360 align:start position:0%
legit but when his sister idle for so
 
01:47:05.450 --> 01:47:05.460 align:start position:0%
long we got to do something about it and
 
01:47:08.090 --> 01:47:08.100 align:start position:0%
this is a wonderful solution and this
 
01:47:10.250 --> 01:47:10.260 align:start position:0%
committee conference report is right on
 
01:47:12.770 --> 01:47:12.780 align:start position:0%
I ask that you support the report thank
 
01:47:13.850 --> 01:47:13.860 align:start position:0%
you very much
 
01:47:16.310 --> 01:47:16.320 align:start position:0%
as a member of yield the questions
 
01:47:21.410 --> 01:47:21.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:24.050 --> 01:47:24.060 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is the committee at
 
01:47:29.570 --> 01:47:29.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:31.609 --> 01:47:31.619 align:start position:0%
representative luno has requested a
 
01:48:05.510 --> 01:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:05.520 --> 01:48:24.109 align:start position:0%
 
it

01:48:24.109 --> 01:48:24.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:24.119 --> 01:48:26.149 align:start position:0%
 
is

01:48:26.149 --> 01:48:26.159 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:48:26.159 --> 01:48:30.410 align:start position:0%
is
clear

01:48:30.410 --> 01:48:30.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:32.149 --> 01:48:32.159 align:start position:0%
the motion before us to accept the
 
01:48:33.530 --> 01:48:33.540 align:start position:0%
committee accomplishments report on
 
01:48:36.830 --> 01:48:36.840 align:start position:0%
House Bill 536 this is a division vote
 
01:48:39.109 --> 01:48:39.119 align:start position:0%
chair recognizer representative Tanner
 
01:48:47.270 --> 01:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:49.669 --> 01:48:49.679 align:start position:0%
if I know the original bill on
 
01:48:52.189 --> 01:48:52.199 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight that passed in
 
01:48:56.209 --> 01:48:56.219 align:start position:0%
this house on consent was changed by
 
01:48:59.270 --> 01:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
adding an unrelated amendment that
 
01:49:01.570 --> 01:49:01.580 align:start position:0%
mandates that a public school district
 
01:49:04.430 --> 01:49:04.440 align:start position:0%
Sells school facilities
 
01:49:07.070 --> 01:49:07.080 align:start position:0%
against the will of the locally elected
 
01:49:08.149 --> 01:49:08.159 align:start position:0%
School Board
 
01:49:10.010 --> 01:49:10.020 align:start position:0%
and if I know that this amendment
 
01:49:11.990 --> 01:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
further puts our Department of Education
 
01:49:15.229 --> 01:49:15.239 align:start position:0%
in the position of dealing with real
 
01:49:18.290 --> 01:49:18.300 align:start position:0%
estate and appointing someone to set a
 
01:49:19.910 --> 01:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
fair market value
 
01:49:22.370 --> 01:49:22.380 align:start position:0%
for these local real estate sales and
 
01:49:25.910 --> 01:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
transactions would I now vote red to
 
01:49:28.729 --> 01:49:28.739 align:start position:0%
stop this overreach by the state and the
 
01:49:31.250 --> 01:49:31.260 align:start position:0%
Department of Education in decisions
 
01:49:32.870 --> 01:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
that should be made by the local
 
01:49:35.450 --> 01:49:35.460 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and their elected School
 
01:49:37.729 --> 01:49:37.739 align:start position:0%
boards please press red
 
01:49:39.050 --> 01:49:39.060 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:49:40.910 --> 01:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
chair recognize representative Ladd for
 
01:49:48.109 --> 01:49:48.119 align:start position:0%

01:54:19.430 --> 01:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker I'm just going to
 
01:54:20.930 --> 01:54:20.940 align:start position:0%
speak on one portion of this bill that
 
01:54:22.970 --> 01:54:22.980 align:start position:0%
has to do with the revising the rules
 
01:54:25.010 --> 01:54:25.020 align:start position:0%
for the site evaluation committee I
 
01:54:26.330 --> 01:54:26.340 align:start position:0%
believe I'm the only one in the house
 
01:54:27.770 --> 01:54:27.780 align:start position:0%
that's actually served on one of these
 
01:54:29.870 --> 01:54:29.880 align:start position:0%
and I served on six or seven of them and
 
01:54:32.270 --> 01:54:32.280 align:start position:0%
the process we have is not very good
 
01:54:35.030 --> 01:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
it's very slow very cumbersome it needs
 
01:54:37.490 --> 01:54:37.500 align:start position:0%
to be fixed I was at a ferc meeting in
 
01:54:39.410 --> 01:54:39.420 align:start position:0%
Maine last week and talked to people in
 
01:54:42.050 --> 01:54:42.060 align:start position:0%
Industry about building projects in New
 
01:54:44.510 --> 01:54:44.520 align:start position:0%
England and New Hampshire as well and
 
01:54:46.970 --> 01:54:46.980 align:start position:0%
the basic sentiment is is we don't want
 
01:54:49.189 --> 01:54:49.199 align:start position:0%
much built anywhere and one of the
 
01:54:51.290 --> 01:54:51.300 align:start position:0%
reasons is our citing process is so
 
01:54:54.410 --> 01:54:54.420 align:start position:0%
difficult the latest uh Power one that
 
01:54:57.050 --> 01:54:57.060 align:start position:0%
was under this was the Antrim wind plan
 
01:54:59.689 --> 01:54:59.699 align:start position:0%
which took two applications in six years
 
01:55:02.870 --> 01:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
to get permitted and that's a basically
 
01:55:04.970 --> 01:55:04.980 align:start position:0%
average is an output of about nine
 
01:55:07.430 --> 01:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
megawatts so for nine megawatts it took
 
01:55:09.950 --> 01:55:09.960 align:start position:0%
six years that sends a message don't
 
01:55:11.990 --> 01:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
come to New Hampshire so we need to fix
 
01:55:14.750 --> 01:55:14.760 align:start position:0%
this this is anybody's was in favor of
 
01:55:17.330 --> 01:55:17.340 align:start position:0%
any type of new transmission New
 
01:55:20.810 --> 01:55:20.820 align:start position:0%
Generation that includes Renewables if
 
01:55:22.430 --> 01:55:22.440 align:start position:0%
you're in favor of the offshore wind
 
01:55:24.109 --> 01:55:24.119 align:start position:0%
projects they all are going to need
 
01:55:26.629 --> 01:55:26.639 align:start position:0%
transmission if you sign the letter on
 
01:55:28.910 --> 01:55:28.920 align:start position:0%
the two states transmission project
 
01:55:31.010 --> 01:55:31.020 align:start position:0%
that's recently been sent around that
 
01:55:32.510 --> 01:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
would have to go to the site evaluation
 
01:55:34.189 --> 01:55:34.199 align:start position:0%
committee as well as any other
 
01:55:36.169 --> 01:55:36.179 align:start position:0%
transmission project we're not saying
 
01:55:38.689 --> 01:55:38.699 align:start position:0%
that it should be a rubber stamp but the
 
01:55:40.490 --> 01:55:40.500 align:start position:0%
thing needs to be made better it needs
 
01:55:43.609 --> 01:55:43.619 align:start position:0%
to be more efficient there's a lot of
 
01:55:45.410 --> 01:55:45.420 align:start position:0%
discussion about this and things it does
 
01:55:47.209 --> 01:55:47.219 align:start position:0%
and doesn't do it doesn't take the
 
01:55:49.810 --> 01:55:49.820 align:start position:0%
Public's ability to get involved away
 
01:55:52.250 --> 01:55:52.260 align:start position:0%
there's still a provision in there for
 
01:55:53.470 --> 01:55:53.480 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General
 
01:55:56.629 --> 01:55:56.639 align:start position:0%
appoint a public Council which would
 
01:55:59.090 --> 01:55:59.100 align:start position:0%
represent everybody anybody that wanted
 
01:56:01.729 --> 01:56:01.739 align:start position:0%
to send in letters could do that also if
 
01:56:03.229 --> 01:56:03.239 align:start position:0%
you're in the community where the
 
01:56:05.570 --> 01:56:05.580 align:start position:0%
project is being built you can get
 
01:56:06.950 --> 01:56:06.960 align:start position:0%
together with your neighbors or by
 
01:56:09.169 --> 01:56:09.179 align:start position:0%
yourself we recognizes intervening get
 
01:56:10.790 --> 01:56:10.800 align:start position:0%
full intravenous status in these
 
01:56:12.950 --> 01:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
hearings so you can actually go in and
 
01:56:15.470 --> 01:56:15.480 align:start position:0%
not only testify but cross-examine other
 
01:56:17.990 --> 01:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
Witnesses so this is not a perfect bill
 
01:56:19.790 --> 01:56:19.800 align:start position:0%
it doesn't completely make the process
 
01:56:22.370 --> 01:56:22.380 align:start position:0%
fantastic but it's a needed step in the
 
01:56:23.930 --> 01:56:23.940 align:start position:0%
right direction if you want to see new
 
01:56:26.450 --> 01:56:26.460 align:start position:0%
generation especially most of that's
 
01:56:28.070 --> 01:56:28.080 align:start position:0%
going to be renewable so if you're in
 
01:56:29.810 --> 01:56:29.820 align:start position:0%
favor of renewable generation and the
 
01:56:31.850 --> 01:56:31.860 align:start position:0%
transmission needed to get it to the
 
01:56:35.930 --> 01:56:35.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:37.970 --> 01:56:37.980 align:start position:0%
Geo recognize representative partial to
 
01:56:44.270 --> 01:56:44.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:52.669 --> 01:56:52.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:54.470 --> 01:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
while I am loath to delve into five
 
01:56:56.510 --> 01:56:56.520 align:start position:0%
portions of this Franken bill
 
01:56:58.850 --> 01:56:58.860 align:start position:0%
as legislators we deserve to know what
 
01:57:01.189 --> 01:57:01.199 align:start position:0%
is bundled in this legislation so I will
 
01:57:03.649 --> 01:57:03.659 align:start position:0%
do my best to be brief
 
01:57:03.659 --> 01:57:05.330 align:start position:0%
do my best to be brief
first

01:57:05.330 --> 01:57:05.340 align:start position:0%
first
 
01:57:08.990 --> 01:57:09.000 align:start position:0%
it requires the uh first it repeals the
 
01:57:11.570 --> 01:57:11.580 align:start position:0%
requirement for utilities to submit a
 
01:57:14.750 --> 01:57:14.760 align:start position:0%
lease cost integrative resource plan
 
01:57:19.609 --> 01:57:19.619 align:start position:0%
also known as LC IRP don't remember that
 
01:57:21.229 --> 01:57:21.239 align:start position:0%
they say they submit this with the
 
01:57:23.209 --> 01:57:23.219 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission and these
 
01:57:24.530 --> 01:57:24.540 align:start position:0%
are big words that provide New
 
01:57:26.450 --> 01:57:26.460 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's assurance that our energy
 
01:57:29.270 --> 01:57:29.280 align:start position:0%
Supply is adequately planned for and
 
01:57:32.209 --> 01:57:32.219 align:start position:0%
delivered at a reasonable price
 
01:57:33.589 --> 01:57:33.599 align:start position:0%
with recent established from the
 
01:57:35.390 --> 01:57:35.400 align:start position:0%
Department of energy a gutted Public
 
01:57:37.250 --> 01:57:37.260 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission is no longer the
 
01:57:39.410 --> 01:57:39.420 align:start position:0%
best repository for these plans and I
 
01:57:42.709 --> 01:57:42.719 align:start position:0%
would agree on that however it does not
 
01:57:44.629 --> 01:57:44.639 align:start position:0%
mean the utilities should not consider
 
01:57:46.790 --> 01:57:46.800 align:start position:0%
rate payer costs in determining our
 
01:57:48.169 --> 01:57:48.179 align:start position:0%
future needs
 
01:57:51.350 --> 01:57:51.360 align:start position:0%
even in a decoupled utility Market
 
01:57:54.050 --> 01:57:54.060 align:start position:0%
by dereliction of our oversight on lease
 
01:57:56.930 --> 01:57:56.940 align:start position:0%
cost planning any stranded costs for bad
 
01:57:59.030 --> 01:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
investments will certainly be passed on
 
01:58:01.010 --> 01:58:01.020 align:start position:0%
to the rate buyers
 
01:58:03.410 --> 01:58:03.420 align:start position:0%
and in this age of skyrocketing Energy
 
01:58:06.649 --> 01:58:06.659 align:start position:0%
prices we need proper oversight to
 
01:58:09.109 --> 01:58:09.119 align:start position:0%
ensure reasonable planning
 
01:58:11.089 --> 01:58:11.099 align:start position:0%
much of the public testimony wisely
 
01:58:13.390 --> 01:58:13.400 align:start position:0%
advocated for some long-needed reform
 
01:58:15.890 --> 01:58:15.900 align:start position:0%
including utilities and our consumer
 
01:58:18.649 --> 01:58:18.659 align:start position:0%
advocate but nobody advocated for its
 
01:58:18.659 --> 01:58:21.169 align:start position:0%
advocate but nobody advocated for its
elimination

01:58:21.169 --> 01:58:21.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:22.970 --> 01:58:22.980 align:start position:0%
another aspect of this ranking bill is
 
01:58:25.250 --> 01:58:25.260 align:start position:0%
the other silly notion that having a
 
01:58:27.770 --> 01:58:27.780 align:start position:0%
department of energy provide a rough
 
01:58:31.010 --> 01:58:31.020 align:start position:0%
average cost of the renewable portfolio
 
01:58:31.020 --> 01:58:33.609 align:start position:0%
average cost of the renewable portfolio
standard

01:58:33.609 --> 01:58:33.619 align:start position:0%
standard
 
01:58:38.089 --> 01:58:38.099 align:start position:0%
nor customers yearly electric bill
 
01:58:40.550 --> 01:58:40.560 align:start position:0%
is a good idea
 
01:58:42.709 --> 01:58:42.719 align:start position:0%
the cost will be calculated and printed
 
01:58:45.229 --> 01:58:45.239 align:start position:0%
once a year and have no relationship to
 
01:58:48.830 --> 01:58:48.840 align:start position:0%
any portion of your specific bill
 
01:58:51.050 --> 01:58:51.060 align:start position:0%
neither will there be any context for
 
01:58:53.649 --> 01:58:53.659 align:start position:0%
understanding the
 
01:58:58.430 --> 01:58:58.440 align:start position:0%
readable renewable portfolio standard
 
01:59:00.770 --> 01:59:00.780 align:start position:0%
as a legislator I'm not sure if anybody
 
01:59:02.030 --> 01:59:02.040 align:start position:0%
to explain this to any of my
 
01:59:05.689 --> 01:59:05.699 align:start position:0%
constituents and if I had my brothers I
 
01:59:08.330 --> 01:59:08.340 align:start position:0%
would see this legislation remained
 
01:59:10.310 --> 01:59:10.320 align:start position:0%
where we had earlier voted at as a
 
01:59:14.750 --> 01:59:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:18.229 --> 01:59:18.239 align:start position:0%
sadly this legislation also dissolves
 
01:59:20.330 --> 01:59:20.340 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency and sustainable energy
 
01:59:23.689 --> 01:59:23.699 align:start position:0%
board more big words easy board
 
01:59:26.450 --> 01:59:26.460 align:start position:0%
and it returns those responsibilities to
 
01:59:28.310 --> 01:59:28.320 align:start position:0%
the Department of energy
 
01:59:30.410 --> 01:59:30.420 align:start position:0%
the easy board is a volunteer resource
 
01:59:32.089 --> 01:59:32.099 align:start position:0%
of respected leaders from all energy
 
01:59:32.099 --> 01:59:33.830 align:start position:0%
of respected leaders from all energy
sectors

01:59:33.830 --> 01:59:33.840 align:start position:0%
sectors
 
01:59:35.510 --> 01:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
it will not be reproducible with the
 
01:59:36.830 --> 01:59:36.840 align:start position:0%
confines of the Department of energy
 
01:59:39.350 --> 01:59:39.360 align:start position:0%
that is already claiming Staffing
 
01:59:42.950 --> 01:59:42.960 align:start position:0%
shortages and budget challenges
 
01:59:45.830 --> 01:59:45.840 align:start position:0%
fourth portion of this Franken bill
 
01:59:48.229 --> 01:59:48.239 align:start position:0%
poses changes to site evaluation
 
01:59:49.669 --> 01:59:49.679 align:start position:0%
committee process
 
01:59:51.470 --> 01:59:51.480 align:start position:0%
now we do need to streamline site
 
01:59:51.480 --> 01:59:52.790 align:start position:0%
now we do need to streamline site
evaluation

01:59:52.790 --> 01:59:52.800 align:start position:0%
evaluation
 
01:59:55.490 --> 01:59:55.500 align:start position:0%
but abolishing public input in favor of
 
01:59:57.890 --> 01:59:57.900 align:start position:0%
severely downsized puc it's not
 
01:59:59.890 --> 01:59:59.900 align:start position:0%
streamlining the process but rather
 
02:00:03.470 --> 02:00:03.480 align:start position:0%
steamrolling our constituents
 
02:00:04.910 --> 02:00:04.920 align:start position:0%
this portion of the bill had numerous
 
02:00:06.589 --> 02:00:06.599 align:start position:0%
unbetted amendments before being
 
02:00:08.810 --> 02:00:08.820 align:start position:0%
retained by committee
 
02:00:11.629 --> 02:00:11.639 align:start position:0%
one reason for its retained status was
 
02:00:14.450 --> 02:00:14.460 align:start position:0%
over the lack of a fiscal null which I
 
02:00:15.830 --> 02:00:15.840 align:start position:0%
see is still missing from the current
 
02:00:18.950 --> 02:00:18.960 align:start position:0%
bill you'll be asked to vote on
 
02:00:22.550 --> 02:00:22.560 align:start position:0%
now this bill does get one thing right
 
02:00:24.709 --> 02:00:24.719 align:start position:0%
it removes requirements small energy
 
02:00:26.629 --> 02:00:26.639 align:start position:0%
producers be located in the same
 
02:00:29.390 --> 02:00:29.400 align:start position:0%
municipality as group members
 
02:00:32.030 --> 02:00:32.040 align:start position:0%
a town with high energy needs will now
 
02:00:35.330 --> 02:00:35.340 align:start position:0%
be able to join adjacent municipalities
 
02:00:37.910 --> 02:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
that may have other resources but not
 
02:00:40.370 --> 02:00:40.380 align:start position:0%
the same power demands this is an
 
02:00:41.930 --> 02:00:41.940 align:start position:0%
excellent bit of legislation that should
 
02:00:44.270 --> 02:00:44.280 align:start position:0%
have passed on its own merits
 
02:00:46.250 --> 02:00:46.260 align:start position:0%
rather than gutted and been taken hard
 
02:00:49.129 --> 02:00:49.139 align:start position:0%
as passage by this Franken bill
 
02:00:51.109 --> 02:00:51.119 align:start position:0%
and this is also that little piece of
 
02:00:52.790 --> 02:00:52.800 align:start position:0%
cheese that's the bait
 
02:00:56.810 --> 02:00:56.820 align:start position:0%
now know that in the past I've advocated
 
02:01:00.109 --> 02:01:00.119 align:start position:0%
uh for any clean net metering bill and I
 
02:01:02.330 --> 02:01:02.340 align:start position:0%
will continue to do so we do need a
 
02:01:04.129 --> 02:01:04.139 align:start position:0%
clean net metering bill but this is not
 
02:01:04.139 --> 02:01:07.070 align:start position:0%
clean net metering bill but this is not
it

02:01:07.070 --> 02:01:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:09.890 --> 02:01:09.900 align:start position:0%
now taking uh these five infrastructures
 
02:01:11.330 --> 02:01:11.340 align:start position:0%
seem to have something for everybody to
 
02:01:13.669 --> 02:01:13.679 align:start position:0%
hate clearly bundling bad legislation
 
02:01:16.070 --> 02:01:16.080 align:start position:0%
does absolutely nothing to improve it
 
02:01:17.810 --> 02:01:17.820 align:start position:0%
now I'd like to give one final reason
 
02:01:19.609 --> 02:01:19.619 align:start position:0%
for non-concurrence
 
02:01:22.250 --> 02:01:22.260 align:start position:0%
we already voted this bill down earlier
 
02:01:23.689 --> 02:01:23.699 align:start position:0%
this month
 
02:01:25.070 --> 02:01:25.080 align:start position:0%
forcing it through a committee of
 
02:01:26.810 --> 02:01:26.820 align:start position:0%
conference that produced no changes
 
02:01:29.570 --> 02:01:29.580 align:start position:0%
whatsoever shows a profound lack of good
 
02:01:32.750 --> 02:01:32.760 align:start position:0%
faith and should be recorded accordingly
 
02:01:35.390 --> 02:01:35.400 align:start position:0%
please vote red for non-compliance and I
 
02:01:38.930 --> 02:01:38.940 align:start position:0%
request a division Vault thank you
 
02:01:40.430 --> 02:01:40.440 align:start position:0%
do you recognize your representative
 
02:01:50.209 --> 02:01:50.219 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:54.649 --> 02:01:54.659 align:start position:0%
the house and the other bodies conferees
 
02:01:57.890 --> 02:01:57.900 align:start position:0%
in the committee of conference
 
02:02:00.530 --> 02:02:00.540 align:start position:0%
spoke eloquently about how this bill was
 
02:02:02.930 --> 02:02:02.940 align:start position:0%
a classic example of a bipartisan
 
02:02:02.940 --> 02:02:05.450 align:start position:0%
a classic example of a bipartisan
compromise

02:02:05.450 --> 02:02:05.460 align:start position:0%
compromise
 
02:02:09.589 --> 02:02:09.599 align:start position:0%
it provides policy Provisions that many
 
02:02:13.070 --> 02:02:13.080 align:start position:0%
of our citizens and constituents want us
 
02:02:16.430 --> 02:02:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:19.089 --> 02:02:19.099 align:start position:0%
it provides a way for municipal
 
02:02:21.850 --> 02:02:21.860 align:start position:0%
taxpayers to seek some relief by
 
02:02:25.609 --> 02:02:25.619 align:start position:0%
installing renewable energy projects in
 
02:02:28.550 --> 02:02:28.560 align:start position:0%
their towns and those projects can span
 
02:02:31.430 --> 02:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
multiple towns with the passage of this
 
02:02:31.440 --> 02:02:33.890 align:start position:0%
multiple towns with the passage of this
bill

02:02:33.890 --> 02:02:33.900 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:36.290 --> 02:02:36.300 align:start position:0%
not only do Municipal taxpayers benefit
 
02:02:39.830 --> 02:02:39.840 align:start position:0%
from that but labor unions want to see
 
02:02:42.589 --> 02:02:42.599 align:start position:0%
this bill passed as well because they
 
02:02:48.229 --> 02:02:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:50.750 --> 02:02:50.760 align:start position:0%
but this bill goes much farther than
 
02:02:50.760 --> 02:02:52.129 align:start position:0%
but this bill goes much farther than
just

02:02:52.129 --> 02:02:52.139 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:02:54.410 --> 02:02:54.420 align:start position:0%
removing Municipal boundaries from the
 
02:02:58.129 --> 02:02:58.139 align:start position:0%
municipal group net group net metering
 
02:02:58.139 --> 02:03:00.050 align:start position:0%
municipal group net group net metering
host

02:03:00.050 --> 02:03:00.060 align:start position:0%
host
 
02:03:03.410 --> 02:03:03.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:07.010 --> 02:03:07.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:10.790 --> 02:03:10.800 align:start position:0%
this bill also removes some burdensome
 
02:03:13.850 --> 02:03:13.860 align:start position:0%
regulation that is driving up costs for
 
02:03:13.860 --> 02:03:16.609 align:start position:0%
regulation that is driving up costs for
ratepayers

02:03:16.609 --> 02:03:16.619 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:18.589 --> 02:03:18.599 align:start position:0%
and that's an important
 
02:03:20.629 --> 02:03:20.639 align:start position:0%
step forward
 
02:03:23.270 --> 02:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
for the policy the energy policy of our
 
02:03:23.280 --> 02:03:25.669 align:start position:0%
for the policy the energy policy of our
state

02:03:25.669 --> 02:03:25.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:28.430 --> 02:03:28.440 align:start position:0%
my distinguished College colleague from
 
02:03:31.250 --> 02:03:31.260 align:start position:0%
Stratford talked about the SEC reforms
 
02:03:32.750 --> 02:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
that are in this bill so I won't talk
 
02:03:35.510 --> 02:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
about those but they are also important
 
02:03:35.520 --> 02:03:37.310 align:start position:0%
about those but they are also important
reforms

02:03:37.310 --> 02:03:37.320 align:start position:0%
reforms
 
02:03:37.320 --> 02:03:39.350 align:start position:0%
reforms
together

02:03:39.350 --> 02:03:39.360 align:start position:0%
together
 
02:03:42.050 --> 02:03:42.060 align:start position:0%
it's a package of good energy policy
 
02:03:46.669 --> 02:03:46.679 align:start position:0%
reforms that both sides can embrace
 
02:03:50.390 --> 02:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:53.149 --> 02:03:53.159 align:start position:0%
zenovos has requested a division
 
02:03:55.070 --> 02:03:55.080 align:start position:0%
this will be a division vote members

02:04:57.169 --> 02:04:57.179 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is to occur on how
 
02:05:00.890 --> 02:05:00.900 align:start position:0%
to concur on House Bill 281. this is
 
02:05:03.229 --> 02:05:03.239 align:start position:0%
going to be a division vote
 
02:05:05.089 --> 02:05:05.099 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative corpsman
 
02:05:09.649 --> 02:05:09.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:11.629 --> 02:05:11.639 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
02:05:14.930 --> 02:05:14.940 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know that the version of
 
02:05:18.109 --> 02:05:18.119 align:start position:0%
this bill that the house passed had only
 
02:05:20.629 --> 02:05:20.639 align:start position:0%
to do with least cost integrated
 
02:05:22.310 --> 02:05:22.320 align:start position:0%
resource planning
 
02:05:24.109 --> 02:05:24.119 align:start position:0%
and if I know that the version of this
 
02:05:26.510 --> 02:05:26.520 align:start position:0%
bill passed by the other body
 
02:05:29.570 --> 02:05:29.580 align:start position:0%
tacked on three other unrelated house
 
02:05:32.930 --> 02:05:32.940 align:start position:0%
bills and parts of a fourth and that two
 
02:05:35.330 --> 02:05:35.340 align:start position:0%
of these tacked on bills were retained
 
02:05:37.669 --> 02:05:37.679 align:start position:0%
in the house science technology and
 
02:05:40.010 --> 02:05:40.020 align:start position:0%
energy committee so that they have not
 
02:05:43.490 --> 02:05:43.500 align:start position:0%
been discussed in the house as a body
 
02:05:45.950 --> 02:05:45.960 align:start position:0%
and if I know that the motion to concur
 
02:05:47.629 --> 02:05:47.639 align:start position:0%
with the version passed by the other
 
02:05:50.390 --> 02:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
body failed in the house
 
02:05:52.370 --> 02:05:52.380 align:start position:0%
and if I know that the house voted to
 
02:05:53.750 --> 02:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
send this bill to a committee of
 
02:05:56.870 --> 02:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
conference by just a single vote
 
02:05:58.609 --> 02:05:58.619 align:start position:0%
and if I know that the committee of
 
02:06:02.149 --> 02:06:02.159 align:start position:0%
conference made no changes whatsoever to
 
02:06:03.589 --> 02:06:03.599 align:start position:0%
the version that the house did not
 
02:06:05.510 --> 02:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
concur with
 
02:06:05.520 --> 02:06:06.950 align:start position:0%
concur with
and

02:06:06.950 --> 02:06:06.960 align:start position:0%

02:27:27.889 --> 02:27:27.899 align:start position:0%
I will leave you with these powerful
 
02:27:30.170 --> 02:27:30.180 align:start position:0%
words shared by Novus family's friend
 
02:27:33.349 --> 02:27:33.359 align:start position:0%
during the funeral
 
02:27:35.870 --> 02:27:35.880 align:start position:0%
Nova went into her cocoon and emerged a
 
02:27:38.510 --> 02:27:38.520 align:start position:0%
beautiful butterfly a transgender male
 
02:27:40.849 --> 02:27:40.859 align:start position:0%
Nova was struggling but happier than
 
02:27:42.530 --> 02:27:42.540 align:start position:0%
they that they had discovered who they
 
02:27:42.540 --> 02:27:43.730 align:start position:0%
they that they had discovered who they
are

02:27:43.730 --> 02:27:43.740 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:27:45.830 --> 02:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
unfortunately not everybody is accepting
 
02:27:47.750 --> 02:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
and that led to a lot of pain in this
 
02:27:49.309 --> 02:27:49.319 align:start position:0%
beautiful child's life
 
02:27:51.230 --> 02:27:51.240 align:start position:0%
though in pain and darkness Nova
 
02:27:53.929 --> 02:27:53.939 align:start position:0%
continued to shine his light on everyone
 
02:27:56.690 --> 02:27:56.700 align:start position:0%
he loved chorus and drama he joined
 
02:27:58.429 --> 02:27:58.439 align:start position:0%
student government where he helped to
 
02:28:00.230 --> 02:28:00.240 align:start position:0%
plan and carry out fun events for his
 
02:28:02.090 --> 02:28:02.100 align:start position:0%
fellow students as well as Charity
 
02:28:04.190 --> 02:28:04.200 align:start position:0%
fundraising for his community
 
02:28:06.050 --> 02:28:06.060 align:start position:0%
did you know that a butterfly's average
 
02:28:06.060 --> 02:28:07.429 align:start position:0%
did you know that a butterfly's average
lifespan

02:28:07.429 --> 02:28:07.439 align:start position:0%
lifespan
 
02:28:10.490 --> 02:28:10.500 align:start position:0%
after emerging is roughly 14 days
 
02:28:13.790 --> 02:28:13.800 align:start position:0%
Nova's lifespan was 14 years
 
02:28:15.410 --> 02:28:15.420 align:start position:0%
that beautiful butterfly spread his
 
02:28:17.570 --> 02:28:17.580 align:start position:0%
wings and flew higher than he has ever
 
02:28:19.550 --> 02:28:19.560 align:start position:0%
flown before
 
02:28:22.010 --> 02:28:22.020 align:start position:0%
Nova had a mission and he left that
 
02:28:24.770 --> 02:28:24.780 align:start position:0%
mission in his parents hands he longed
 
02:28:26.690 --> 02:28:26.700 align:start position:0%
to live in a world where being different
 
02:28:29.270 --> 02:28:29.280 align:start position:0%
being gay and transgender was accepted
 
02:28:31.550 --> 02:28:31.560 align:start position:0%
and understood that choosing to be
 
02:28:34.250 --> 02:28:34.260 align:start position:0%
himself was a personal choice and not
 
02:28:36.290 --> 02:28:36.300 align:start position:0%
one that hurt anyone else
 
02:28:38.389 --> 02:28:38.399 align:start position:0%
that the need to bully someone over that
 
02:28:41.450 --> 02:28:41.460 align:start position:0%
choice is not okay and not needed he
 
02:28:43.550 --> 02:28:43.560 align:start position:0%
wanted a kind world
 
02:28:46.309 --> 02:28:46.319 align:start position:0%
the best way to remember Nova is to be
 
02:28:48.410 --> 02:28:48.420 align:start position:0%
an advocate an advocate for mental
 
02:28:51.170 --> 02:28:51.180 align:start position:0%
health awareness an advocate for lgbtqa
 
02:28:53.690 --> 02:28:53.700 align:start position:0%
Community if you see something say
 
02:28:57.889 --> 02:28:57.899 align:start position:0%

02:33:29.210 --> 02:33:29.220 align:start position:0%
Croydon I Rise to speak about the
 
02:33:31.190 --> 02:33:31.200 align:start position:0%
widespread road damage that occurred
 
02:33:34.370 --> 02:33:34.380 align:start position:0%
during the recent many heavy rainstorms
 
02:33:36.349 --> 02:33:36.359 align:start position:0%
and affected many communities throughout
 
02:33:37.490 --> 02:33:37.500 align:start position:0%
the state
 
02:33:40.130 --> 02:33:40.140 align:start position:0%
Croydon received 5.8 inches of rain in
 
02:33:41.929 --> 02:33:41.939 align:start position:0%
several hours last week
 
02:33:43.849 --> 02:33:43.859 align:start position:0%
and then yesterday we got an additional
 
02:33:46.370 --> 02:33:46.380 align:start position:0%
two inches in less than 20 minutes
 
02:33:48.770 --> 02:33:48.780 align:start position:0%
there's a moat between my driveway and
 
02:33:51.230 --> 02:33:51.240 align:start position:0%
the road and that's minor compared to
 
02:33:53.510 --> 02:33:53.520 align:start position:0%
the rest of the impact
 
02:33:55.670 --> 02:33:55.680 align:start position:0%
the road damages in Croydon will cost
 
02:33:57.469 --> 02:33:57.479 align:start position:0%
over one and a half times our annual
 
02:33:59.809 --> 02:33:59.819 align:start position:0%
Town budget so we are working with
 
02:34:01.670 --> 02:34:01.680 align:start position:0%
director Buxton at New Hampshire
 
02:34:03.170 --> 02:34:03.180 align:start position:0%
Homeland Security and Emergency
 
02:34:05.570 --> 02:34:05.580 align:start position:0%
Management to hopefully qualify for a
 
02:34:07.490 --> 02:34:07.500 align:start position:0%
FEMA application
 
02:34:10.309 --> 02:34:10.319 align:start position:0%
we meet the county minimum it's not
 
02:34:12.469 --> 02:34:12.479 align:start position:0%
clear yet whether we meet the Statewide
 
02:34:15.110 --> 02:34:15.120 align:start position:0%
minimum that is needed to be eligible
 
02:34:16.849 --> 02:34:16.859 align:start position:0%
for FEMA
 
02:34:20.030 --> 02:34:20.040 align:start position:0%
so a survey has been sent from director
 
02:34:23.150 --> 02:34:23.160 align:start position:0%
Buxton to all communities asking that
 
02:34:25.969 --> 02:34:25.979 align:start position:0%
any storm damages that occurred within
 
02:34:28.969 --> 02:34:28.979 align:start position:0%
the time period from June 16th the
 
02:34:32.270 --> 02:34:32.280 align:start position:0%
beginning of this series of wet weather
 
02:34:34.910 --> 02:34:34.920 align:start position:0%
be submitted even if your communities do
 
02:34:36.410 --> 02:34:36.420 align:start position:0%
not appear to have enough damage that
 
02:34:38.389 --> 02:34:38.399 align:start position:0%
you would qualify for help
 
02:34:41.750 --> 02:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
they're trying to aggregate the impact
 
02:34:44.870 --> 02:34:44.880 align:start position:0%
to approach it in that way which is
 
02:34:47.510 --> 02:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
legitimate to do so I am just asking
 
02:34:49.670 --> 02:34:49.680 align:start position:0%
each of you to please encourage your
 
02:34:52.250 --> 02:34:52.260 align:start position:0%
community emergency directors to fill
 
02:34:54.590 --> 02:34:54.600 align:start position:0%
