00:07:28.129 --> 00:07:28.139 align:start position:0%

Corrections all in favor of accepting
 
00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:36.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:40.129 --> 00:07:40.139 align:start position:0%
interim commissioner Lori Weaver for our
 
00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:57.529 --> 00:07:57.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:01.380 align:start position:0%
it prepared an update for you focused
 
00:08:03.409 --> 00:08:03.419 align:start position:0%
primarily on Behavioral Health
 
00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:07.800 align:start position:0%
happenings this week and the week before
 
00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:09.380 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:12.180 align:start position:0%
you may or may not be aware that on
 
00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
Wednesday of this week at governor and
 
00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
Council the department uh received full
 
00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:21.240 align:start position:0%
support from the council to pursue a
 
00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:23.400 align:start position:0%
contract with solution health and this
 
00:08:25.129 --> 00:08:25.139 align:start position:0%
will increase our
 
00:08:28.969 --> 00:08:28.979 align:start position:0%
okay Acuity beds for the state so we
 
00:08:31.909 --> 00:08:31.919 align:start position:0%
will have a total of 120 beds in that
 
00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
hospital so that will bring a net gain
 
00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:38.820 align:start position:0%
of 44 additional adult drf beds 13 gyro
 
00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
psych beds and 24 Youth and Adolescent
 
00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:43.860 align:start position:0%
beds so
 
00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:46.620 align:start position:0%
solution help will be taking their
 
00:08:49.009 --> 00:08:49.019 align:start position:0%
existing beds that they have and then
 
00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:51.000 align:start position:0%
taking these new beds and putting them
 
00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:53.160 align:start position:0%
all into the new facility so the
 
00:08:57.050 --> 00:08:57.060 align:start position:0%
expectation is that those beds or that
 
00:08:58.790 --> 00:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
hot the hospital I think by the end of
 
00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:01.980 align:start position:0%
24 beginning of 25 is the expected date
 
00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:04.040 align:start position:0%
for that so that was a long time
 
00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:07.140 align:start position:0%
in the process to get that contract
 
00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:09.060 align:start position:0%
through so we're quite pleased and the
 
00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:11.820 align:start position:0%
time is of essence because we're using
 
00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:13.860 align:start position:0%
for the capital defrayment costs we're
 
00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:16.320 align:start position:0%
using 15 million of Opera funds so we
 
00:09:18.949 --> 00:09:18.959 align:start position:0%
have really very little time to make
 
00:09:20.509 --> 00:09:20.519 align:start position:0%
sure the money is encumbered and then
 
00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
also that by December of 26 that the all
 
00:09:26.269 --> 00:09:26.279 align:start position:0%
the money is spent but we are remaining
 
00:09:27.829 --> 00:09:27.839 align:start position:0%
positive that that will happen so that
 
00:09:29.449 --> 00:09:29.459 align:start position:0%
was a big win I think in terms of trying
 
00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:31.320 align:start position:0%
to build some additional capacity as we
 
00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:33.660 align:start position:0%
all know capacity is an issue not just
 
00:09:35.329 --> 00:09:35.339 align:start position:0%
on the front end but also on the back
 
00:09:35.339 --> 00:09:37.190 align:start position:0%
on the front end but also on the back
end

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:37.200 align:start position:0%
end
 
00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:38.940 align:start position:0%
any question do you want me to just keep
 
00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:40.070 align:start position:0%
any question do you want me to just keep
going

00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
going
 
00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:41.820 align:start position:0%
let's just see if there's any questions
 
00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:43.680 align:start position:0%
on that that is indeed a big win
 
00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
representative King
 
00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
yeah for the minutes I just wanted to
 
00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:49.260 align:start position:0%
make sure which which hospital a
 
00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:52.740 align:start position:0%
solution help solution Health thank you
 
00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:55.380 align:start position:0%
representative Weber and could you give
 
00:09:57.470 --> 00:09:57.480 align:start position:0%
us the numbers a bit The increased
 
00:09:58.970 --> 00:09:58.980 align:start position:0%
numbers of beds again because I didn't
 
00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:01.620 align:start position:0%
get quite a whole of those down sure
 
00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:04.200 align:start position:0%
um so it was a total of um the total is
 
00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
120 with the net gains are 44 dealt uh
 
00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:11.580 align:start position:0%
13 of the jarrow psych okay and then 24
 
00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
for the Youth and Adolescent that's it
 
00:10:17.509 --> 00:10:17.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:17.519 --> 00:10:19.730 align:start position:0%
 
this

00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:19.740 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:20.509 align:start position:0%
this
um

00:10:20.509 --> 00:10:20.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:24.949 --> 00:10:24.959 align:start position:0%
I assume is the the victory part of the
 
00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
loss we incurred when the plan for
 
00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:30.660 align:start position:0%
something in around Epping didn't happen
 
00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:34.620 align:start position:0%
is this the replacement for that didn't
 
00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:36.720 align:start position:0%
going not going forward yeah we had two
 
00:10:38.269 --> 00:10:38.279 align:start position:0%
interested parties the other party was
 
00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:40.260 align:start position:0%
HCA and then we did we were not able to
 
00:10:42.769 --> 00:10:42.779 align:start position:0%
move forward with haca come to any sort
 
00:10:44.509 --> 00:10:44.519 align:start position:0%
of agreement so but we were with
 
00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
solution health so yes okay good thank
 
00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:47.150 align:start position:0%

yes anything else
 
00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:51.660 align:start position:0%
representative Weber and could you
 
00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:53.880 align:start position:0%
remind me where this is sure the
 
00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:55.620 align:start position:0%
location has not yet been announced part
 
00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:57.240 align:start position:0%
of the was the vendor waiting to make
 
00:10:58.670 --> 00:10:58.680 align:start position:0%
sure the contractor was going to be
 
00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:00.240 align:start position:0%
approved I do know that there are three
 
00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:02.040 align:start position:0%
locations that they've scoped out and
 
00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:03.300 align:start position:0%
once they had approval they were going
 
00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:04.740 align:start position:0%
to start to move on that so they're not
 
00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:06.600 align:start position:0%
starting from scratch they are just yeah
 
00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
it'll be Southern New Hampshire uh
 
00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:14.269 --> 00:11:14.279 align:start position:0%
is one of those if you are able to say
 
00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:16.920 align:start position:0%
uh is one of those
 
00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:17.889 align:start position:0%
uh is one of those
um

00:11:17.889 --> 00:11:17.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:20.700 align:start position:0%
pamstead on the grounds of Hampstead
 
00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:24.060 align:start position:0%
Hospital no no okay
 
00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:25.500 align:start position:0%
there's only so much I've got something
 
00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:28.380 align:start position:0%
else I know I yeah live right there
 
00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:32.220 align:start position:0%
um yeah yes go ahead I would just put a
 
00:11:35.389 --> 00:11:35.399 align:start position:0%
plug in to be more towards Manchester or
 
00:11:37.069 --> 00:11:37.079 align:start position:0%
the middle of the state as opposed to
 
00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:39.480 align:start position:0%
all the way over in the Southeast Corner
 
00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:41.640 align:start position:0%
as somebody who comes from the southwest
 
00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:44.220 align:start position:0%
corner of the state sure I think we've
 
00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:45.540 align:start position:0%
been pretty clear with the vendor in
 
00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:46.980 align:start position:0%
terms of where the needs are I mean
 
00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:48.240 align:start position:0%
ultimately it's going to be their
 
00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
decision but an availability of course
 
00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:54.240 align:start position:0%
but yes got it thank you representative
 
00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
Edwards uh thank you Mr chair
 
00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:00.420 align:start position:0%
um so I'm just curious of the three
 
00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
sites is the current site where the city
 
00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:06.360 align:start position:0%
center is located there's so much land
 
00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:09.180 align:start position:0%
there would that be a possible siding
 
00:12:11.329 --> 00:12:11.339 align:start position:0%
location I don't know if it's a possible
 
00:12:12.949 --> 00:12:12.959 align:start position:0%
sighting location it's as I understand
 
00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:14.700 align:start position:0%
it's not one of them I don't have a lot
 
00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:16.200 align:start position:0%
of information on the location we were
 
00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:17.940 align:start position:0%
not privy to that I was just told that
 
00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
they had three locations that they were
 
00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:23.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:26.030 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:26.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:30.240 align:start position:0%
carry on right so uh our psychiatric
 
00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:31.740 align:start position:0%
residential treatment facility at
 
00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:34.500 align:start position:0%
Hampstead Has Broken Ground for
 
00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:36.540 align:start position:0%
construction I believe at the end of
 
00:12:38.269 --> 00:12:38.279 align:start position:0%
last week I was out there at the
 
00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:39.720 align:start position:0%
beginning of this week and was able to
 
00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:41.940 align:start position:0%
see the wing that they are converting
 
00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
and it's in pretty good shape so I'd say
 
00:12:46.009 --> 00:12:46.019 align:start position:0%
that within probably the next six weeks
 
00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:47.700 align:start position:0%
that will be complete it may be sooner
 
00:12:50.509 --> 00:12:50.519 align:start position:0%
but I'll just go with six weeks and at
 
00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:52.980 align:start position:0%
that point uh we'll be they've hired
 
00:12:56.449 --> 00:12:56.459 align:start position:0%
staff to uh critical staff not all the
 
00:12:58.550 --> 00:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
staffs to begin the programming and once
 
00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:00.600 align:start position:0%
the construction is complete admit
 
00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:02.150 align:start position:0%
the construction is complete admit
children

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
children
 
00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:04.620 align:start position:0%
I was out there a week before you and
 
00:13:08.329 --> 00:13:08.339 align:start position:0%
was very impressed with both the work
 
00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:11.100 align:start position:0%
there are doing facility wise but also
 
00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:13.200 align:start position:0%
the vision they had would you for the
 
00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
group distinguish between the existing
 
00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:17.820 align:start position:0%
unit and the new one in terms of any
 
00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
program differences well the sure the
 
00:13:23.629 --> 00:13:23.639 align:start position:0%
the prtf really is a step down from the
 
00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
high acute care that the the current
 
00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
facility has all of its beds designated
 
00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:31.500 align:start position:0%
at this would be a step down so this
 
00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:33.240 align:start position:0%
could be youth or adolescents that
 
00:13:35.329 --> 00:13:35.339 align:start position:0%
aren't quite ready to discharge to home
 
00:13:38.569 --> 00:13:38.579 align:start position:0%
or even yet to a community residential
 
00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:40.740 align:start position:0%
site so they would step down here they
 
00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:42.360 align:start position:0%
would have more flexibilities than they
 
00:13:44.629 --> 00:13:44.639 align:start position:0%
did in an inpatient setting so they
 
00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:47.220 align:start position:0%
would have safety they would have a case
 
00:13:48.889 --> 00:13:48.899 align:start position:0%
management system that wraps around them
 
00:13:50.329 --> 00:13:50.339 align:start position:0%
while they're there but the whole idea
 
00:13:52.009 --> 00:13:52.019 align:start position:0%
is to be able to get them to transition
 
00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:55.500 align:start position:0%
out back as soon as possible so it's
 
00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
it's a nice step down it's also a
 
00:13:59.629 --> 00:13:59.639 align:start position:0%
service we don't have so we send a lot
 
00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:01.380 align:start position:0%
of our kids out of state right now for
 
00:14:04.129 --> 00:14:04.139 align:start position:0%
that so when that it arises the hope is
 
00:14:05.629 --> 00:14:05.639 align:start position:0%
that we're able to take care of that
 
00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
need within the state and not have to
 
00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:08.760 align:start position:0%
send kids out of state and keep them
 
00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:11.220 align:start position:0%
close to their families
 
00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:13.740 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:16.920 align:start position:0%
the other good news about a week and a
 
00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:19.620 align:start position:0%
half ago New Hampshire was awarded a
 
00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
samsa grant for working on some we were
 
00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:25.980 align:start position:0%
one of 15 states to be awarded the samsa
 
00:14:27.829 --> 00:14:27.839 align:start position:0%
grant which is basically looking at our
 
00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:29.940 align:start position:0%
community mental health system and
 
00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:31.980 align:start position:0%
basically putting in some supports there
 
00:14:34.069 --> 00:14:34.079 align:start position:0%
to really look at how services are
 
00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:35.940 align:start position:0%
delivered so one of the key components
 
00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:37.620 align:start position:0%
of that was addressing co-occurring
 
00:14:39.829 --> 00:14:39.839 align:start position:0%
issues of mental health and substance
 
00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
use disorder that integrated Approach at
 
00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:44.940 align:start position:0%
that level the goal is to reduce Ed
 
00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:48.540 align:start position:0%
visits and Ed readmissions expanding the
 
00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:50.820 align:start position:0%
cmhc infrastructure and capacity so
 
00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:52.620 align:start position:0%
things like Workforce
 
00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:55.800 align:start position:0%
issues payment methodologies and systems
 
00:14:57.949 --> 00:14:57.959 align:start position:0%
so there's as I understand that there's
 
00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:00.240 align:start position:0%
several CM cmhcs now that are already
 
00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
working towards us so this allows us
 
00:15:04.129 --> 00:15:04.139 align:start position:0%
some money and time to be able to help
 
00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:05.880 align:start position:0%
them be successful to set up that model
 
00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:07.800 align:start position:0%
so we're pretty proud that we were
 
00:15:09.769 --> 00:15:09.779 align:start position:0%
awarded that Grant and I think it'll be
 
00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:11.880 align:start position:0%
another step into an enhancement into
 
00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:14.100 align:start position:0%
our Behavioral Health System my bet is
 
00:15:15.889 --> 00:15:15.899 align:start position:0%
the clerk would like to know what samsa
 
00:15:15.899 --> 00:15:18.470 align:start position:0%
the clerk would like to know what samsa
means

00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:21.180 align:start position:0%
you would be right
 
00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:22.189 align:start position:0%
you would be right
I

00:15:22.189 --> 00:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:15:28.329 --> 00:15:28.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:30.889 --> 00:15:30.899 align:start position:0%

00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:32.100 align:start position:0%
Services
 
00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:34.430 align:start position:0%

00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:34.440 align:start position:0%

00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
so exactly what are the initials oh
 
00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:55.500 align:start position:0%
substance abuse SSU
 
00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:57.250 align:start position:0%
substance abuse SSU
um

00:15:57.250 --> 00:15:57.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:01.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:04.440 align:start position:0%
-s a
 
00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:06.120 align:start position:0%
got it
 
00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:14.090 align:start position:0%
 
services

00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:14.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:20.269 --> 00:16:20.279 align:start position:0%
and I if I can move on to I have two
 
00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:22.680 align:start position:0%
other quick updates um also at
 
00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:24.660 align:start position:0%
Wednesday's council meeting we received
 
00:16:28.069 --> 00:16:28.079 align:start position:0%
approval to add five additional drf beds
 
00:16:30.769 --> 00:16:30.779 align:start position:0%
to Dartmouth Hitchcock so again it's an
 
00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:32.940 align:start position:0%
existing facility
 
00:16:35.569 --> 00:16:35.579 align:start position:0%
um that will be adding five additional
 
00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:37.980 align:start position:0%
drf Beds which will help some of the
 
00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
demand that we have one of the things
 
00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:41.940 align:start position:0%
that I I didn't mention with the
 
00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
solution Health contract but is relevant
 
00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:47.160 align:start position:0%
to both contracts is they both have
 
00:16:49.009 --> 00:16:49.019 align:start position:0%
requirements to serve a minimum of
 
00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
Medicaid population so for solution
 
00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:53.420 align:start position:0%
Health it's 30 percent of the population
 
00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:56.040 align:start position:0%
served should be Medicaid as well as
 
00:16:58.790 --> 00:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth is actually 40 percent
 
00:17:01.069 --> 00:17:01.079 align:start position:0%
so solution health I think is currently
 
00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:03.420 align:start position:0%
operating around 34 percent of serving
 
00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:05.160 align:start position:0%
that population anyways so there's a
 
00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:06.480 align:start position:0%
guarantee that we're going to make sure
 
00:17:07.789 --> 00:17:07.799 align:start position:0%
that the folks that need the services
 
00:17:10.429 --> 00:17:10.439 align:start position:0%
are able to get them
 
00:17:12.829 --> 00:17:12.839 align:start position:0%
and the last
 
00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:15.720 align:start position:0%
well not the last update but we did have
 
00:17:17.569 --> 00:17:17.579 align:start position:0%
a pretty successful floor Amendment
 
00:17:21.049 --> 00:17:21.059 align:start position:0%
yesterday for HB 49 for Our Youth
 
00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
Services Center we're quite uh happy
 
00:17:26.329 --> 00:17:26.339 align:start position:0%
about this in terms of it allows us the
 
00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:28.079 align:start position:0%
work to move forward there's a lot of
 
00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:29.940 align:start position:0%
work to be done as I'm sure everyone is
 
00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:32.700 align:start position:0%
aware in terms of the model developing
 
00:17:34.669 --> 00:17:34.679 align:start position:0%
the model getting the site selection and
 
00:17:36.049 --> 00:17:36.059 align:start position:0%
then working towards building a new
 
00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
facility so we're not going to get ahead
 
00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:38.700 align:start position:0%
of ourselves but we are going to get the
 
00:17:40.789 --> 00:17:40.799 align:start position:0%
work done that we need to get done in
 
00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
the appropriate time so yesterday was a
 
00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:45.900 align:start position:0%
very a good day for those serving
 
00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
children youth and families with this
 
00:17:51.409 --> 00:17:51.419 align:start position:0%
facility kudos to representative Edwards
 
00:17:54.890 --> 00:17:54.900 align:start position:0%
it was a team effort if Mr ribson hadn't
 
00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:56.340 align:start position:0%
done what he had done it never would
 
00:17:59.210 --> 00:17:59.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:01.610 --> 00:18:01.620 align:start position:0%
yes director ribson was very critical
 
00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
but so were you as well I agree it was a
 
00:18:04.789 --> 00:18:04.799 align:start position:0%
team approach and I think it was a good
 
00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:11.400 align:start position:0%
and I would just say we're in the middle
 
00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:13.140 align:start position:0%
of budget as you probably all know in
 
00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:14.280 align:start position:0%
the middle of the halfway through the
 
00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:16.020 align:start position:0%
legislative session so we are humming we
 
00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
are quite busy lots happening still a
 
00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
lot of work to get done and all of these
 
00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:22.140 align:start position:0%
other things happening too so
 
00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of work and not enough
 
00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
people to do it I will still make that
 
00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:26.930 align:start position:0%
people to do it I will still make that
plug

00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:26.940 align:start position:0%
plug
 
00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:29.880 align:start position:0%
however the good news is that our
 
00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate has dropped a little bit
 
00:18:33.409 --> 00:18:33.419 align:start position:0%
since the last time I saw you I believe
 
00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:36.720 align:start position:0%
I told you it was 22.3 and now this uh
 
00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
at this point I think at the end of last
 
00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:41.220 align:start position:0%
week we're down to 19 so it's not a huge
 
00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:42.900 align:start position:0%
draw but it is trending in the right
 
00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:44.580 align:start position:0%
direction and the goal is to try to keep
 
00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:47.460 align:start position:0%
it trending down
 
00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:52.789 --> 00:18:52.799 align:start position:0%
would you care to say a few words
 
00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
speaking of uh representative Edwards he
 
00:18:57.650 --> 00:18:57.660 align:start position:0%
is the one that introduced me to the
 
00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:01.260 align:start position:0%
military term after Action Report
 
00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:02.029 align:start position:0%
military term after Action Report
um

00:19:02.029 --> 00:19:02.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:04.200 align:start position:0%
we used to just go let's all sit down
 
00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:06.240 align:start position:0%
and see what we did wrong but I like his
 
00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:08.460 align:start position:0%
term much better and we're going to be
 
00:19:10.909 --> 00:19:10.919 align:start position:0%
doing that over a period of time would
 
00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:12.780 align:start position:0%
you care to say a few words to that sure
 
00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:14.340 align:start position:0%
I spoke with director Buxton this
 
00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:16.860 align:start position:0%
morning so director Buxton is for
 
00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:18.660 align:start position:0%
Homeland Security emergency management
 
00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
he's the director the after action
 
00:19:23.150 --> 00:19:23.160 align:start position:0%
report that we would do would be with
 
00:19:24.770 --> 00:19:24.780 align:start position:0%
FEMA and the funding would come through
 
00:19:27.650 --> 00:19:27.660 align:start position:0%
hsem and would be a contract was
 
00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:29.940 align:start position:0%
actually approved this past Wednesday at
 
00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:31.620 align:start position:0%
the council to get that work done so
 
00:19:33.409 --> 00:19:33.419 align:start position:0%
that is driven from
 
00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:36.600 align:start position:0%
from procuring the work is from hsem
 
00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:39.480 align:start position:0%
however the after action report of what
 
00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:41.360 align:start position:0%
we did right and what we could do better
 
00:19:43.669 --> 00:19:43.679 align:start position:0%
will involve all the stakeholders all
 
00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
the players everybody that was a part of
 
00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:49.380 align:start position:0%
that response team so director Buxton
 
00:19:51.650 --> 00:19:51.660 align:start position:0%
has told me that he will be getting me
 
00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:53.700 align:start position:0%
at least a high level of what the next
 
00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:55.620 align:start position:0%
steps are and I had mentioned that there
 
00:19:57.950 --> 00:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
was a desire from this committee to hear
 
00:19:59.810 --> 00:19:59.820 align:start position:0%
more so we want to be able to provide
 
00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:01.320 align:start position:0%
something that's meaningful for you
 
00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:04.860 align:start position:0%
probably not next month but maybe as we
 
00:20:07.330 --> 00:20:07.340 align:start position:0%
get closer to the summer
 
00:20:09.169 --> 00:20:09.179 align:start position:0%
he'll have we'll have more information
 
00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:10.380 align:start position:0%
on that
 
00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:14.220 align:start position:0%
as you and I had spoken previously to to
 
00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:16.200 align:start position:0%
my way of thinking there is the
 
00:20:18.529 --> 00:20:18.539 align:start position:0%
department there is the legislature and
 
00:20:21.289 --> 00:20:21.299 align:start position:0%
there's the general public and all three
 
00:20:24.169 --> 00:20:24.179 align:start position:0%
of those things swirl around in various
 
00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:27.960 align:start position:0%
ways during a pandemic and there was
 
00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:30.440 align:start position:0%
some creative
 
00:20:34.130 --> 00:20:34.140 align:start position:0%
interface during the pandemic that
 
00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
perhaps we could learn from and
 
00:20:39.529 --> 00:20:39.539 align:start position:0%
establish not rigidly but establish as
 
00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:42.360 align:start position:0%
kind of General ways to go forward for
 
00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:44.820 align:start position:0%
when the next one hits I've been
 
00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:46.620 align:start position:0%
recommending and a couple of you have
 
00:20:48.409 --> 00:20:48.419 align:start position:0%
actually started reading the book the
 
00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:51.480 align:start position:0%
psychology of the pandemics by Stephen
 
00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
Taylor and if you just read the book
 
00:20:56.570 --> 00:20:56.580 align:start position:0%
without reading the introduction which
 
00:20:58.370 --> 00:20:58.380 align:start position:0%
several of my high school teachers said
 
00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:00.020 align:start position:0%
one must never do
 
00:21:02.810 --> 00:21:02.820 align:start position:0%
but if you did you would read through
 
00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:05.880 align:start position:0%
the book and probably conclude with two
 
00:21:07.789 --> 00:21:07.799 align:start position:0%
glaring errors
 
00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:10.620 align:start position:0%
this was a tremendous retrospective on
 
00:21:13.669 --> 00:21:13.679 align:start position:0%
the recent pandemic then if you read the
 
00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
forward you'd realize it was nothing of
 
00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:17.400 align:start position:0%
the sort this book was written two years
 
00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:21.200 align:start position:0%
before covid uh it was a scholarly as
 
00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:23.900 align:start position:0%
psychological and sociological
 
00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
understanding of reactions of
 
00:21:29.529 --> 00:21:29.539 align:start position:0%
individuals people groups officials
 
00:21:32.690 --> 00:21:32.700 align:start position:0%
organizations and so on to pandemics
 
00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:35.880 align:start position:0%
with special reference to the 1918-19
 
00:21:39.649 --> 00:21:39.659 align:start position:0%
flu epidemic but also Ebola and various
 
00:21:43.029 --> 00:21:43.039 align:start position:0%
of the recent many pandemics
 
00:21:46.450 --> 00:21:46.460 align:start position:0%
I think in terms of how
 
00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:50.520 align:start position:0%
departments and legislators and the
 
00:21:53.149 --> 00:21:53.159 align:start position:0%
general public interface I found this to
 
00:21:56.149 --> 00:21:56.159 align:start position:0%
be tremendously helpful
 
00:21:56.159 --> 00:21:56.990 align:start position:0%
be tremendously helpful
um

00:21:56.990 --> 00:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:59.570 --> 00:21:59.580 align:start position:0%
I can put names to categories he's
 
00:22:01.669 --> 00:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
talking about in here just from having
 
00:22:05.149 --> 00:22:05.159 align:start position:0%
lived it as a legislator but also as the
 
00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
executive director of a small Medical
 
00:22:09.529 --> 00:22:09.539 align:start position:0%
Center and how we approach it from that
 
00:22:11.810 --> 00:22:11.820 align:start position:0%
perspective with our patients so this is
 
00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:14.580 align:start position:0%
a plea if I don't get anything for this
 
00:22:16.909 --> 00:22:16.919 align:start position:0%
I should have negotiated that ahead of
 
00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:20.700 align:start position:0%
time but the book is the psychology of
 
00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:22.860 align:start position:0%
pandemic Stephen Taylor and if we're
 
00:22:25.789 --> 00:22:25.799 align:start position:0%
going to have a little little tease next
 
00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:27.960 align:start position:0%
time and a much bigger report the times
 
00:22:30.529 --> 00:22:30.539 align:start position:0%
after that this would be something we
 
00:22:34.250 --> 00:22:34.260 align:start position:0%
would all do well to read and reread but
 
00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:37.320 align:start position:0%
I'm very much looking forward to to this
 
00:22:40.490 --> 00:22:40.500 align:start position:0%
because there'll be another one soon
 
00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:43.080 align:start position:0%
I'm afraid hopefully not for a little
 
00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:44.930 align:start position:0%
I'm afraid hopefully not for a little
while

00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:44.940 align:start position:0%
while
 
00:22:47.149 --> 00:22:47.159 align:start position:0%
after I've retired from the legislature
 
00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:49.340 align:start position:0%
I think and
 
00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:51.480 align:start position:0%
representative McKay will have to keep
 
00:22:54.950 --> 00:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:56.029 --> 00:22:56.039 align:start position:0%
anything else
 
00:22:59.090 --> 00:22:59.100 align:start position:0%
for the commissioner
 
00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:09.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:14.090 --> 00:23:14.100 align:start position:0%
like to call up Henry Lipman for the uh
 
00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
update in terms of Medicaid uh heard
 
00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
some good things coming out of the
 
00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
Senate this week would you update us
 
00:23:25.610 --> 00:23:25.620 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you for the record
 
00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:27.480 align:start position:0%
Henry Littman and
 
00:23:30.049 --> 00:23:30.059 align:start position:0%
um I sent you uh what the abbreviation
 
00:23:33.409 --> 00:23:33.419 align:start position:0%
for samhsa is so that could be forwarded
 
00:23:35.090 --> 00:23:35.100 align:start position:0%
to the clerk
 
00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:37.980 align:start position:0%
so that's exactly right okay good and I
 
00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:41.280 align:start position:0%
appreciate that thank you
 
00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:43.010 align:start position:0%
appreciate that thank you
um

00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:43.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
so I had shared with you on the dental
 
00:23:51.649 --> 00:23:51.659 align:start position:0%
front that we have received all the
 
00:23:53.930 --> 00:23:53.940 align:start position:0%
necessary legislative requirements with
 
00:23:56.330 --> 00:23:56.340 align:start position:0%
respect to state plan amendments which
 
00:23:57.610 --> 00:23:57.620 align:start position:0%
there were like four or five of those
 
00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:01.380 align:start position:0%
and several waivers uh
 
00:24:04.549 --> 00:24:04.559 align:start position:0%
um as well as an 11 15 waiver to be able
 
00:24:07.730 --> 00:24:07.740 align:start position:0%
to fall within the prescribed design
 
00:24:09.529 --> 00:24:09.539 align:start position:0%
particularly around cost sharing and
 
00:24:14.029 --> 00:24:14.039 align:start position:0%
limitations on who receives uh dentures
 
00:24:15.669 --> 00:24:15.679 align:start position:0%
and the like
 
00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:17.580 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
in terms of the network development
 
00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:22.620 align:start position:0%
that's progressing we're we're I think
 
00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
good to start on April 1st in fact
 
00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:30.720 align:start position:0%
there'll be a van in um both Concord and
 
00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
Colebrook to help people with
 
00:24:35.810 --> 00:24:35.820 align:start position:0%
eligibility or even to provide some
 
00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:38.690 align:start position:0%
eligibility or even to provide some
um

00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:38.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:40.440 align:start position:0%
some dental services to members
 
00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:43.260 align:start position:0%
potentially on that Saturday and again
 
00:24:45.770 --> 00:24:45.780 align:start position:0%
they'll be in Concord in Colebrook so
 
00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:47.340 align:start position:0%
we're getting the sort of the middle and
 
00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:49.620 align:start position:0%
the the top of the state
 
00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
and things are just coming together on
 
00:24:55.549 --> 00:24:55.559 align:start position:0%
that it was a very fast uh time frame to
 
00:24:56.690 --> 00:24:56.700 align:start position:0%
stand it up from the time the
 
00:24:58.370 --> 00:24:58.380 align:start position:0%
legislation has passed it may not seem
 
00:25:00.289 --> 00:25:00.299 align:start position:0%
like that was fast but it was very fast
 
00:25:03.289 --> 00:25:03.299 align:start position:0%
and we had full cooperation from CMS in
 
00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:04.440 align:start position:0%
terms of understanding what the
 
00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:06.780 align:start position:0%
legislative intent was to help us get it
 
00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:08.580 align:start position:0%
done in time
 
00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:10.010 align:start position:0%
done in time
um

00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:10.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:14.940 align:start position:0%
in terms of this the the Senate Bill 263
 
00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:16.380 align:start position:0%
um as you know it
 
00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:19.140 align:start position:0%
um Mr chair can can I ask a question
 
00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
about the dental program before yeah
 
00:25:22.789 --> 00:25:22.799 align:start position:0%
before we go past Dental Programs go
 
00:25:24.909 --> 00:25:24.919 align:start position:0%
ahead okay
 
00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
you guys have done fantastic work on
 
00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:29.580 align:start position:0%
getting this program stood up I'm really
 
00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:31.500 align:start position:0%
glad that we got the waivers in place
 
00:25:33.409 --> 00:25:33.419 align:start position:0%
that was the only thing that was causing
 
00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
me to lose sleep so so thank you now I
 
00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:39.480 align:start position:0%
can go back to sleep uh I I can you can
 
00:25:42.529 --> 00:25:42.539 align:start position:0%
you quantify or describe a little more
 
00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:46.200 align:start position:0%
of the status of the provider Network do
 
00:25:49.370 --> 00:25:49.380 align:start position:0%
we do we have glaring holes somewhere
 
00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:52.260 align:start position:0%
that we should be concerned about
 
00:25:55.250 --> 00:25:55.260 align:start position:0%
I think that we're still working that I
 
00:25:57.169 --> 00:25:57.179 align:start position:0%
don't have a quantitative answer for you
 
00:25:57.179 --> 00:25:58.310 align:start position:0%
don't have a quantitative answer for you
today

00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:26:01.010 --> 00:26:01.020 align:start position:0%
um but we in terms of being able to
 
00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:01.690 align:start position:0%
um but we in terms of being able to
um

00:26:01.690 --> 00:26:01.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:04.260 align:start position:0%
lockdowns the essential care that if
 
00:26:06.049 --> 00:26:06.059 align:start position:0%
someone's having a dental emergency and
 
00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:08.340 align:start position:0%
and some preventative care I think we're
 
00:26:11.269 --> 00:26:11.279 align:start position:0%
in a strong enough position to to launch
 
00:26:12.649 --> 00:26:12.659 align:start position:0%
um I think I could certainly provide a
 
00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
written update by the end of the month
 
00:26:17.029 --> 00:26:17.039 align:start position:0%
because that's when you know the
 
00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
Contracting of people is sort of
 
00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
sometimes a last minute activity we're
 
00:26:24.049 --> 00:26:24.059 align:start position:0%
still working on it very hard and Delta
 
00:26:25.930 --> 00:26:25.940 align:start position:0%
Dental out of their own
 
00:26:29.269 --> 00:26:29.279 align:start position:0%
capitation amount is is adding some
 
00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
incentives to try to fill some of the
 
00:26:33.289 --> 00:26:33.299 align:start position:0%
holes that that that exist but
 
00:26:34.909 --> 00:26:34.919 align:start position:0%
definitely we can give you a map of that
 
00:26:38.810 --> 00:26:38.820 align:start position:0%
and and uh so so since you started with
 
00:26:41.149 --> 00:26:41.159 align:start position:0%
filling in holes I want to drill into
 
00:26:46.750 --> 00:26:46.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:49.549 --> 00:26:49.559 align:start position:0%
what are the capabilities of these
 
00:26:52.490 --> 00:26:52.500 align:start position:0%
mobile Dental Vans are do they have any
 
00:26:55.010 --> 00:26:55.020 align:start position:0%
portable x-ray in them for example do
 
00:26:57.470 --> 00:26:57.480 align:start position:0%
they you know what what what what level
 
00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:00.240 align:start position:0%
of care can be provided
 
00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
the straight answer is I am not fully
 
00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:04.320 align:start position:0%
aware of that I've
 
00:27:06.409 --> 00:27:06.419 align:start position:0%
um Dr Finney who's had to be out of town
 
00:27:07.789 --> 00:27:07.799 align:start position:0%
today could have helped me with that
 
00:27:10.669 --> 00:27:10.679 align:start position:0%
answer but um I can Circle back with you
 
00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:13.500 align:start position:0%
with an email next week
 
00:27:17.269 --> 00:27:17.279 align:start position:0%
also on Dental I'd be just I'd be really
 
00:27:20.330 --> 00:27:20.340 align:start position:0%
encouraged a little update on in the
 
00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
last couple of months how many Dental
 
00:27:25.730 --> 00:27:25.740 align:start position:0%
students have entered into an agreement
 
00:27:31.669 --> 00:27:31.679 align:start position:0%
with us for a reduction on their tuition
 
00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
loans in exchange for service I know
 
00:27:41.390 --> 00:27:41.400 align:start position:0%
when I last spoke with Delta Dental this
 
00:27:43.549 --> 00:27:43.559 align:start position:0%
is something they do I just you know if
 
00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
somebody gets hey we got two more last
 
00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:46.500 align:start position:0%
month that would really make me feel
 
00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:47.990 align:start position:0%
month that would really make me feel
happy

00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
happy
 
00:27:52.010 --> 00:27:52.020 align:start position:0%
if we did I will uh Sarah knows that
 
00:27:56.149 --> 00:27:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:58.610 --> 00:27:58.620 align:start position:0%
but we'll get it to you thank you
 
00:28:01.669 --> 00:28:01.679 align:start position:0%
anything else on Dental
 
00:28:01.679 --> 00:28:03.529 align:start position:0%
anything else on Dental
yes

00:28:03.529 --> 00:28:03.539 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:28:05.330 --> 00:28:05.340 align:start position:0%
I had two things one of which is I'm
 
00:28:07.130 --> 00:28:07.140 align:start position:0%
trying to remember who I was talking to
 
00:28:10.430 --> 00:28:10.440 align:start position:0%
who uh was saying that there was a
 
00:28:12.830 --> 00:28:12.840 align:start position:0%
program you know we have all these loan
 
00:28:14.450 --> 00:28:14.460 align:start position:0%
forgiveness programs and you have to
 
00:28:17.450 --> 00:28:17.460 align:start position:0%
work X number of years and
 
00:28:20.090 --> 00:28:20.100 align:start position:0%
uh somebody I think at our County
 
00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
meeting was talking about a program
 
00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:24.010 align:start position:0%
meeting was talking about a program
where

00:28:24.010 --> 00:28:24.020 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:28:26.810 --> 00:28:26.820 align:start position:0%
each month
 
00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
you get a stipend that covers your loan
 
00:28:33.950 --> 00:28:33.960 align:start position:0%
payment and it just made a penny drop
 
00:28:36.110 --> 00:28:36.120 align:start position:0%
for me because
 
00:28:38.330 --> 00:28:38.340 align:start position:0%
when something goes wrong and something
 
00:28:41.409 --> 00:28:41.419 align:start position:0%
sometimes does go wrong you know either
 
00:28:43.669 --> 00:28:43.679 align:start position:0%
somebody's already paid the loans up
 
00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:45.900 align:start position:0%
front loses the person they thought they
 
00:28:47.930 --> 00:28:47.940 align:start position:0%
were going to have or somebody who
 
00:28:49.130 --> 00:28:49.140 align:start position:0%
thought their loans were going to be
 
00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:51.240 align:start position:0%
repaid has gotten three quarters of the
 
00:28:52.970 --> 00:28:52.980 align:start position:0%
way and then loses
 
00:28:55.850 --> 00:28:55.860 align:start position:0%
the repayment and this just takes care
 
00:28:57.769 --> 00:28:57.779 align:start position:0%
of it on a month by month basis and
 
00:29:01.070 --> 00:29:01.080 align:start position:0%
you're always building up an incentive
 
00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
for the employee to stay because it's
 
00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:05.880 align:start position:0%
being taken care of and I just wanted to
 
00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:07.320 align:start position:0%
throw that out because I just thought it
 
00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
was brilliant and I never thought of it
 
00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:09.769 align:start position:0%
was brilliant and I never thought of it
before

00:29:09.769 --> 00:29:09.779 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:29:12.409 --> 00:29:12.419 align:start position:0%
but the other thing I just wanted to say
 
00:29:14.570 --> 00:29:14.580 align:start position:0%
was congratulations because this has
 
00:29:17.570 --> 00:29:17.580 align:start position:0%
been a long time coming and and
 
00:29:19.850 --> 00:29:19.860 align:start position:0%
really appreciated that we're getting to
 
00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:21.240 align:start position:0%
the day
 
00:29:23.570 --> 00:29:23.580 align:start position:0%
thank you and um I'm sure to bring that
 
00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:26.220 align:start position:0%
back to the staff please do very hard to
 
00:29:28.010 --> 00:29:28.020 align:start position:0%
make this happen
 
00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:30.600 align:start position:0%
um and I can follow up on all these
 
00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:32.640 align:start position:0%
three or four issues and
 
00:29:34.669 --> 00:29:34.679 align:start position:0%
before we get too long in the tooth yeah
 
00:29:37.070 --> 00:29:37.080 align:start position:0%
I had to do that for representative
 
00:29:39.430 --> 00:29:39.440 align:start position:0%
Edwards he opened it up
 
00:29:44.149 --> 00:29:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:46.549 --> 00:29:46.559 align:start position:0%
please continue so I think the on the
 
00:29:48.049 --> 00:29:48.059 align:start position:0%
agenda was uh
 
00:29:50.210 --> 00:29:50.220 align:start position:0%
what was going on with the granite
 
00:29:51.889 --> 00:29:51.899 align:start position:0%
Advantage Healthcare program and the
 
00:29:54.649 --> 00:29:54.659 align:start position:0%
Senate took a policy vote I think people
 
00:29:58.490 --> 00:29:58.500 align:start position:0%
are aware of 24 to zero and then um how
 
00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:02.520 align:start position:0%
Senate Finance this week uh uh passed uh
 
00:30:03.950 --> 00:30:03.960 align:start position:0%
seven to nothing
 
00:30:06.049 --> 00:30:06.059 align:start position:0%
um in finance committee
 
00:30:08.690 --> 00:30:08.700 align:start position:0%
um and I don't know the senator the
 
00:30:10.730 --> 00:30:10.740 align:start position:0%
chairman would like to add any color to
 
00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
that uh or not uh certainly
 
00:30:17.269 --> 00:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
certainly the the Senate to
 
00:30:19.930 --> 00:30:19.940 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly supported it yesterday
 
00:30:23.389 --> 00:30:23.399 align:start position:0%
it was not a table thing so that it will
 
00:30:25.029 --> 00:30:25.039 align:start position:0%
go to the house
 
00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
and I hope that the House
 
00:30:29.810 --> 00:30:29.820 align:start position:0%
Representatives in here will be able to
 
00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
uh to Shepherd it through
 
00:30:34.549 --> 00:30:34.559 align:start position:0%
and I don't know if representative
 
00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:36.720 align:start position:0%
Edwards would um uh would like to speak
 
00:30:39.230 --> 00:30:39.240 align:start position:0%
to what division three did uh this week
 
00:30:41.810 --> 00:30:41.820 align:start position:0%
on on that but there's a a house
 
00:30:44.029 --> 00:30:44.039 align:start position:0%
position from division three I guess
 
00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
will be considered uh next week is that
 
00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
right uh representative division three
 
00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
is now all done with its work they're
 
00:30:54.110 --> 00:30:54.120 align:start position:0%
doing the the last of our bills uh and
 
00:30:55.909 --> 00:30:55.919 align:start position:0%
then finance will vote on them I think
 
00:30:58.490 --> 00:30:58.500 align:start position:0%
everything out on Monday officially so
 
00:31:02.269 --> 00:31:02.279 align:start position:0%
till Monday it's all just uh what what
 
00:31:02.279 --> 00:31:04.310 align:start position:0%
till Monday it's all just uh what what
cement

00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
cement
 
00:31:07.850 --> 00:31:07.860 align:start position:0%
but what cement though does have uh does
 
00:31:09.950 --> 00:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
have a reauthorization
 
00:31:14.750 --> 00:31:14.760 align:start position:0%
um of two years it also it clarifies a
 
00:31:17.389 --> 00:31:17.399 align:start position:0%
little bit more or
 
00:31:20.149 --> 00:31:20.159 align:start position:0%
um the issue of the transition from the
 
00:31:20.159 --> 00:31:21.310 align:start position:0%
um the issue of the transition from the
hospital

00:31:21.310 --> 00:31:21.320 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
00:31:26.690 --> 00:31:26.700 align:start position:0%
donations uh to the liquor fund which is
 
00:31:29.570 --> 00:31:29.580 align:start position:0%
what the Senate position is as well
 
00:31:31.730 --> 00:31:31.740 align:start position:0%
that's just taking a credit for the
 
00:31:34.370 --> 00:31:34.380 align:start position:0%
period in which the donation still is in
 
00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:35.350 align:start position:0%
period in which the donation still is in
place

00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:35.360 align:start position:0%
place
 
00:31:37.789 --> 00:31:37.799 align:start position:0%
but the really the the main difference
 
00:31:41.029 --> 00:31:41.039 align:start position:0%
is whether it's you know permanent
 
00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
reauthorization or or some other period
 
00:31:46.010 --> 00:31:46.020 align:start position:0%
I had raised with the
 
00:31:48.169 --> 00:31:48.179 align:start position:0%
the committee the concern about what
 
00:31:49.970 --> 00:31:49.980 align:start position:0%
impacted potentially a two-year could
 
00:31:53.149 --> 00:31:53.159 align:start position:0%
have on our procurement of the new MCO
 
00:31:55.010 --> 00:31:55.020 align:start position:0%
contract which is will be effective
 
00:31:59.269 --> 00:31:59.279 align:start position:0%
September 1 of 24. um and I'm sure that
 
00:32:02.510 --> 00:32:02.520 align:start position:0%
will be considered at some point in time
 
00:32:05.450 --> 00:32:05.460 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards so so what the
 
00:32:07.370 --> 00:32:07.380 align:start position:0%
division three did was we tried to
 
00:32:09.230 --> 00:32:09.240 align:start position:0%
anticipate exactly what the Senate
 
00:32:11.510 --> 00:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
version was and we took it you know
 
00:32:14.990 --> 00:32:15.000 align:start position:0%
comma for comma and we ended up putting
 
00:32:16.909 --> 00:32:16.919 align:start position:0%
a two-year suspense on it instead of
 
00:32:20.570 --> 00:32:20.580 align:start position:0%
permanent reauthorization if it were me
 
00:32:22.669 --> 00:32:22.679 align:start position:0%
and I didn't have to worry about anyone
 
00:32:25.130 --> 00:32:25.140 align:start position:0%
else I think I would make a six-year
 
00:32:27.230 --> 00:32:27.240 align:start position:0%
authorization so that you would have
 
00:32:29.269 --> 00:32:29.279 align:start position:0%
time to do a normal five-year contract
 
00:32:32.210 --> 00:32:32.220 align:start position:0%
but so we're we there's still work to be
 
00:32:32.220 --> 00:32:33.110 align:start position:0%
but so we're we there's still work to be
done

00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:32:35.210 --> 00:32:35.220 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:32:38.570 --> 00:32:38.580 align:start position:0%
um and I guess the uh that there are any
 
00:32:41.810 --> 00:32:41.820 align:start position:0%
other questions on on the ex Medicaid
 
00:32:43.310 --> 00:32:43.320 align:start position:0%
expansion Grant Advantage Health Care
 
00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:46.140 align:start position:0%
Program I guess the other uh key thing
 
00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:48.840 align:start position:0%
happening is you know I went through a
 
00:32:53.090 --> 00:32:53.100 align:start position:0%
report last month with the committee on
 
00:32:55.549 --> 00:32:55.559 align:start position:0%
the unwind if you will that's actually
 
00:32:59.210 --> 00:32:59.220 align:start position:0%
in motion now and I think don't have a
 
00:33:02.649 --> 00:33:02.659 align:start position:0%
lot to say today about it because
 
00:33:05.269 --> 00:33:05.279 align:start position:0%
people still have opportunities till the
 
00:33:07.789 --> 00:33:07.799 align:start position:0%
end of the month but I think when I if
 
00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:09.720 align:start position:0%
you invite me back next month I will
 
00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:11.880 align:start position:0%
I'll have some information to share
 
00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
there but I think all things considered
 
00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:17.640 align:start position:0%
it's it's uh it's moving pretty well at
 
00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:20.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:22.190 --> 00:33:22.200 align:start position:0%
anything else
 
00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:25.380 align:start position:0%
that's all I have for today anything but
 
00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:27.240 align:start position:0%
Mr Lipman
 
00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:41.640 align:start position:0%

00:33:58.370 --> 00:33:58.380 align:start position:0%
we had a road dedicated to a cornoyer
 
00:34:01.310 --> 00:34:01.320 align:start position:0%
the other day and I leaned over to a
 
00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
francophone near me and said I grew up
 
00:34:05.149 --> 00:34:05.159 align:start position:0%
in a Massachusetts Mill Town that's
 
00:34:09.409 --> 00:34:09.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:09.419 --> 00:34:11.210 align:start position:0%
 
I guess

00:34:11.210 --> 00:34:11.220 align:start position:0%
I guess
 
00:34:14.329 --> 00:34:14.339 align:start position:0%
good morning Karen Hebert director for
 
00:34:16.430 --> 00:34:16.440 align:start position:0%
the division of economic stability for
 
00:34:17.570 --> 00:34:17.580 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:18.889 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
Services

00:34:18.889 --> 00:34:18.899 align:start position:0%
Services
 
00:34:21.770 --> 00:34:21.780 align:start position:0%
hi I'm Marianne barter I'm the chair of
 
00:34:23.149 --> 00:34:23.159 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Child Care advisory
 
00:34:23.159 --> 00:34:24.349 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Child Care advisory
Council

00:34:24.349 --> 00:34:24.359 align:start position:0%
Council
 
00:34:27.230 --> 00:34:27.240 align:start position:0%
heard we'd like me too
 
00:34:29.290 --> 00:34:29.300 align:start position:0%
so the child care advisory Council
 
00:34:31.909 --> 00:34:31.919 align:start position:0%
exists to inform the state and
 
00:34:34.010 --> 00:34:34.020 align:start position:0%
legislative leaders on
 
00:34:36.530 --> 00:34:36.540 align:start position:0%
um situations that would impede child
 
00:34:38.629 --> 00:34:38.639 align:start position:0%
care in the state impede both the growth
 
00:34:41.570 --> 00:34:41.580 align:start position:0%
of child care the availability of it and
 
00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:44.040 align:start position:0%
the affordability of it and certainly
 
00:34:45.829 --> 00:34:45.839 align:start position:0%
the last few years have been challenging
 
00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
in all of these ways I'll say that the
 
00:34:50.329 --> 00:34:50.339 align:start position:0%
child care advisory Council in the past
 
00:34:52.609 --> 00:34:52.619 align:start position:0%
has met every other month and now we're
 
00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
meeting bi-weekly because there is just
 
00:34:56.869 --> 00:34:56.879 align:start position:0%
so much happening in the field we've
 
00:34:58.130 --> 00:34:58.140 align:start position:0%
worked very closely with our state
 
00:35:00.410 --> 00:35:00.420 align:start position:0%
Partners to come up with a plan to
 
00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:02.640 align:start position:0%
improve Child Care Systems in the state
 
00:35:04.089 --> 00:35:04.099 align:start position:0%
moving forward
 
00:35:06.829 --> 00:35:06.839 align:start position:0%
and it's a good plan it's a very strong
 
00:35:10.609 --> 00:35:10.619 align:start position:0%
plan that we hope gets funded and will
 
00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:11.880 align:start position:0%
help us make sure that there's
 
00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
availability of child care moving
 
00:35:15.589 --> 00:35:15.599 align:start position:0%
forward I will say that one of our
 
00:35:17.450 --> 00:35:17.460 align:start position:0%
biggest concerns in the field is the
 
00:35:19.609 --> 00:35:19.619 align:start position:0%
wages Child Care wages are
 
00:35:21.050 --> 00:35:21.060 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily low and they always have
 
00:35:23.290 --> 00:35:23.300 align:start position:0%
been but unfortunately now
 
00:35:25.730 --> 00:35:25.740 align:start position:0%
we are we are about to be the lowest
 
00:35:27.770 --> 00:35:27.780 align:start position:0%
paid industry in the country according
 
00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:29.880 align:start position:0%
to the hunt Institute so the reason why
 
00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
that's becoming such an issue now is
 
00:35:33.650 --> 00:35:33.660 align:start position:0%
because so many other fields pay better
 
00:35:37.430 --> 00:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
and so post pandemic if you perhaps had
 
00:35:39.290 --> 00:35:39.300 align:start position:0%
to choose between child care and Target
 
00:35:41.329 --> 00:35:41.339 align:start position:0%
or Child Care Dunkin Donuts they would
 
00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:43.260 align:start position:0%
pay about the same in child care is a
 
00:35:45.470 --> 00:35:45.480 align:start position:0%
much more enriching way to spend your
 
00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:47.640 align:start position:0%
day unfortunately now the pay
 
00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:49.380 align:start position:0%
differential is significant enough that
 
00:35:51.109 --> 00:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
many people are choosing Dunkin Donuts
 
00:35:53.569 --> 00:35:53.579 align:start position:0%
or Target over child care so the child
 
00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:55.800 align:start position:0%
care advisory Council list has convened
 
00:35:58.010 --> 00:35:58.020 align:start position:0%
a group to look at wages look at funding
 
00:35:59.870 --> 00:35:59.880 align:start position:0%
for increasing wages Statewide to look
 
00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:01.560 align:start position:0%
at what other states are doing to meet
 
00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:03.720 align:start position:0%
to address this issue and to make sure
 
00:36:05.569 --> 00:36:05.579 align:start position:0%
that we put our New Hampshire spin on
 
00:36:06.770 --> 00:36:06.780 align:start position:0%
what other states are doing New
 
00:36:08.690 --> 00:36:08.700 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is a very unique place and
 
00:36:10.250 --> 00:36:10.260 align:start position:0%
solutions that work other places will
 
00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
not necessarily work here so we want to
 
00:36:14.030 --> 00:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
make sure that we continue to be the
 
00:36:15.530 --> 00:36:15.540 align:start position:0%
workforce for the workforce and support
 
00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:24.349 --> 00:36:24.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:26.870 --> 00:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
thank you and I'm happy to be here with
 
00:36:29.569 --> 00:36:29.579 align:start position:0%
Miss barter we've been working very
 
00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:32.280 align:start position:0%
closely with the child care advisory
 
00:36:35.870 --> 00:36:35.880 align:start position:0%
Council particularly in the last couple
 
00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
of years to develop the child care
 
00:36:40.270 --> 00:36:40.280 align:start position:0%
strengthening plan as a result of the
 
00:36:44.270 --> 00:36:44.280 align:start position:0%
2022 Senate Bill 446 direct to the
 
00:36:46.970 --> 00:36:46.980 align:start position:0%
department to come up with sustainable
 
00:36:49.130 --> 00:36:49.140 align:start position:0%
long-term solutions that would
 
00:36:51.470 --> 00:36:51.480 align:start position:0%
strengthen the child care industry in
 
00:36:53.930 --> 00:36:53.940 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and also increase its
 
00:36:57.170 --> 00:36:57.180 align:start position:0%
capacity so we did put together a plan
 
00:36:59.530 --> 00:36:59.540 align:start position:0%
working very closely with the council
 
00:37:03.290 --> 00:37:03.300 align:start position:0%
and for a number of months to put
 
00:37:05.390 --> 00:37:05.400 align:start position:0%
together that plan which had been
 
00:37:08.230 --> 00:37:08.240 align:start position:0%
submitted last of June
 
00:37:11.870 --> 00:37:11.880 align:start position:0%
to the uh to the legislature and to the
 
00:37:13.370 --> 00:37:13.380 align:start position:0%
governor's office
 
00:37:16.670 --> 00:37:16.680 align:start position:0%
so we're been looking at a number of
 
00:37:18.950 --> 00:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
initiatives that we are moving forward
 
00:37:22.250 --> 00:37:22.260 align:start position:0%
with in that particular plan but I would
 
00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
highlight the number of initiatives we
 
00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:27.720 align:start position:0%
have going on in the what's known as the
 
00:37:31.010 --> 00:37:31.020 align:start position:0%
arpa discretionary plan and I left you
 
00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
copies of that particular plan the
 
00:37:36.670 --> 00:37:36.680 align:start position:0%
status report of that plan right now
 
00:37:38.450 --> 00:37:38.460 align:start position:0%
because there are a number of
 
00:37:41.329 --> 00:37:41.339 align:start position:0%
initiatives there that you know we are
 
00:37:43.690 --> 00:37:43.700 align:start position:0%
moving forward with we have funding with
 
00:37:47.150 --> 00:37:47.160 align:start position:0%
uh that we are a number of initiatives
 
00:37:50.450 --> 00:37:50.460 align:start position:0%
that are in development now to help this
 
00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:51.650 align:start position:0%
that are in development now to help this
industry

00:37:51.650 --> 00:37:51.660 align:start position:0%
industry
 
00:37:55.130 --> 00:37:55.140 align:start position:0%
I'm also pleased to uh
 
00:37:57.050 --> 00:37:57.060 align:start position:0%
to let you know that just as of
 
00:37:59.510 --> 00:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
yesterday afternoon gopher did Awards
 
00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
the department 3.6 million dollars
 
00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
specifically from the child care
 
00:38:08.329 --> 00:38:08.339 align:start position:0%
strengthening plan uh for the purposes
 
00:38:11.690 --> 00:38:11.700 align:start position:0%
of providing one-time grants to the
 
00:38:13.370 --> 00:38:13.380 align:start position:0%
child care providers
 
00:38:18.290 --> 00:38:18.300 align:start position:0%
to help reduce operating costs overhead
 
00:38:22.250 --> 00:38:22.260 align:start position:0%
costs so that they could increase wages
 
00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:25.020 align:start position:0%
and support the workforce so there's one
 
00:38:27.410 --> 00:38:27.420 align:start position:0%
particular initiative moving forward
 
00:38:29.690 --> 00:38:29.700 align:start position:0%
that would help the workforce there's a
 
00:38:31.390 --> 00:38:31.400 align:start position:0%
lot more work that needs to be done
 
00:38:34.250 --> 00:38:34.260 align:start position:0%
there is not one single solution that is
 
00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:36.260 align:start position:0%
going to strengthen this particular
 
00:38:40.370 --> 00:38:40.380 align:start position:0%
industry I'm very happy that the council
 
00:38:43.569 --> 00:38:43.579 align:start position:0%
is moving forward with their Workforce
 
00:38:46.910 --> 00:38:46.920 align:start position:0%
meetings and hopefully we will have
 
00:38:48.470 --> 00:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
better information going forward
 
00:38:51.770 --> 00:38:51.780 align:start position:0%
including any particular research and
 
00:38:53.870 --> 00:38:53.880 align:start position:0%
data that could come out of those
 
00:38:56.030 --> 00:38:56.040 align:start position:0%
meetings in order to make some
 
00:39:01.510 --> 00:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:05.930 --> 00:39:05.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:08.640 align:start position:0%
thank you actually representative Weber
 
00:39:14.270 --> 00:39:14.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:15.550 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:15.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:18.770 --> 00:39:18.780 align:start position:0%
my first thought was uh on this whole
 
00:39:22.250 --> 00:39:22.260 align:start position:0%
Child Care issue that we have is uh our
 
00:39:24.349 --> 00:39:24.359 align:start position:0%
business is the New Hampshire businesses
 
00:39:28.430 --> 00:39:28.440 align:start position:0%
being asked how they might solve this uh
 
00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:31.200 align:start position:0%
with their own employees or offering
 
00:39:33.829 --> 00:39:33.839 align:start position:0%
this as a way to attract employees and
 
00:39:35.810 --> 00:39:35.820 align:start position:0%
then I noticed on page three that
 
00:39:37.790 --> 00:39:37.800 align:start position:0%
there's something about business and
 
00:39:40.430 --> 00:39:40.440 align:start position:0%
child care partnership is are they
 
00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:42.349 align:start position:0%
child care partnership is are they
linked

00:39:42.349 --> 00:39:42.359 align:start position:0%
linked
 
00:39:45.109 --> 00:39:45.119 align:start position:0%
so yes we have business partners who are
 
00:39:46.970 --> 00:39:46.980 align:start position:0%
very engaged in this process and they
 
00:39:48.890 --> 00:39:48.900 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that child care Workforce
 
00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
will be needed in order for them to have
 
00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
their own employees having and I'm
 
00:39:54.829 --> 00:39:54.839 align:start position:0%
actually an executive director of a
 
00:39:56.030 --> 00:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
child care facility that has a
 
00:39:57.730 --> 00:39:57.740 align:start position:0%
relationship with two different
 
00:39:59.930 --> 00:39:59.940 align:start position:0%
businesses that do that they give us
 
00:40:01.970 --> 00:40:01.980 align:start position:0%
free space and then we provide child
 
00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:03.960 align:start position:0%
care for their employees and it does cut
 
00:40:06.829 --> 00:40:06.839 align:start position:0%
down on the cost somewhat I think the
 
00:40:08.210 --> 00:40:08.220 align:start position:0%
amounts that we were talking about when
 
00:40:09.410 --> 00:40:09.420 align:start position:0%
we're talking about supporting Child
 
00:40:12.470 --> 00:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
Care are so staggeringly high that it is
 
00:40:13.790 --> 00:40:13.800 align:start position:0%
going to have to be a multi-prong
 
00:40:16.069 --> 00:40:16.079 align:start position:0%
approach so there might be some support
 
00:40:17.810 --> 00:40:17.820 align:start position:0%
to the business Community can offer us
 
00:40:19.970 --> 00:40:19.980 align:start position:0%
but I'm not sure I don't know the
 
00:40:22.370 --> 00:40:22.380 align:start position:0%
affordability of
 
00:40:24.829 --> 00:40:24.839 align:start position:0%
of that moving forward and how much
 
00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
Financial investment they're going to be
 
00:40:28.430 --> 00:40:28.440 align:start position:0%
able to give us or be willing to give us
 
00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
um it's essential though it is a huge
 
00:40:32.390 --> 00:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
sum of money I mean when we our
 
00:40:34.069 --> 00:40:34.079 align:start position:0%
estimates are somewhere in the 30
 
00:40:35.930 --> 00:40:35.940 align:start position:0%
million dollar range for increasing
 
00:40:37.970 --> 00:40:37.980 align:start position:0%
Child Care wages and
 
00:40:39.290 --> 00:40:39.300 align:start position:0%
um Karen was
 
00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
share the wonderful news about gopher
 
00:40:43.550 --> 00:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
which is phenomenal news I mean we are
 
00:40:45.349 --> 00:40:45.359 align:start position:0%
excited about that initiative and we're
 
00:40:47.690 --> 00:40:47.700 align:start position:0%
excited to see it move forward but my
 
00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:50.640 align:start position:0%
payroll is 1.2 million dollars a year so
 
00:40:52.849 --> 00:40:52.859 align:start position:0%
you can see that 3.6 million and I'm
 
00:40:55.730 --> 00:40:55.740 align:start position:0%
just one moderate size Center so you can
 
00:40:57.109 --> 00:40:57.119 align:start position:0%
see where
 
00:40:57.119 --> 00:40:57.770 align:start position:0%
see where
um

00:40:57.770 --> 00:40:57.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:59.750 --> 00:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
3.6 million dollars is a huge amount of
 
00:41:01.609 --> 00:41:01.619 align:start position:0%
money and we're excited to have it it's
 
00:41:03.170 --> 00:41:03.180 align:start position:0%
probably not going to make a huge impact
 
00:41:06.530 --> 00:41:06.540 align:start position:0%
on my my wages
 
00:41:09.230 --> 00:41:09.240 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
00:41:11.810 --> 00:41:11.820 align:start position:0%
thank you and that leads right into my
 
00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
question which is um
 
00:41:16.490 --> 00:41:16.500 align:start position:0%
when we say reducing overhead costs are
 
00:41:18.170 --> 00:41:18.180 align:start position:0%
we talking weatherization are we talking
 
00:41:20.390 --> 00:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
computers that will help you do billing
 
00:41:22.670 --> 00:41:22.680 align:start position:0%
more efficiently what exactly are we
 
00:41:25.730 --> 00:41:25.740 align:start position:0%
talking about with respect to that money
 
00:41:27.890 --> 00:41:27.900 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so that could
 
00:41:30.530 --> 00:41:30.540 align:start position:0%
be anything from an outstanding mortgage
 
00:41:33.710 --> 00:41:33.720 align:start position:0%
or perhaps a long-term lease or rental
 
00:41:37.490 --> 00:41:37.500 align:start position:0%
payments even buying property that would
 
00:41:39.650 --> 00:41:39.660 align:start position:0%
reduce the
 
00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:42.720 align:start position:0%
um the expenditures that you have it
 
00:41:46.150 --> 00:41:46.160 align:start position:0%
could also be anything such as deferred
 
00:41:49.970 --> 00:41:49.980 align:start position:0%
repairs and maintenance that a provider
 
00:41:51.730 --> 00:41:51.740 align:start position:0%
has or
 
00:41:54.890 --> 00:41:54.900 align:start position:0%
expanding programs expanding their
 
00:41:57.609 --> 00:41:57.619 align:start position:0%
outdoor or creating an outdoor
 
00:42:01.150 --> 00:42:01.160 align:start position:0%
setting that's appropriate for children
 
00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
great thank you
 
00:42:06.890 --> 00:42:06.900 align:start position:0%
and I also wanted to answer your
 
00:42:09.849 --> 00:42:09.859 align:start position:0%
question too with respect to the
 
00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
business Improvement project the also
 
00:42:14.329 --> 00:42:14.339 align:start position:0%
the business and child care partnership
 
00:42:16.870 --> 00:42:16.880 align:start position:0%
program that we are
 
00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
developing we've just released an RFP
 
00:42:23.390 --> 00:42:23.400 align:start position:0%
for the business Improvement project so
 
00:42:26.030 --> 00:42:26.040 align:start position:0%
that is underway and the the intent
 
00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
behind that is to really be able to
 
00:42:31.250 --> 00:42:31.260 align:start position:0%
conduct Health assessments with the
 
00:42:33.530 --> 00:42:33.540 align:start position:0%
providers and address really
 
00:42:36.349 --> 00:42:36.359 align:start position:0%
specifically what it is that each of
 
00:42:39.290 --> 00:42:39.300 align:start position:0%
them may particularly need that would
 
00:42:42.069 --> 00:42:42.079 align:start position:0%
strengthen their particular
 
00:42:47.329 --> 00:42:47.339 align:start position:0%
Center or provider setting so we'll end
 
00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
up matching them with the Professionals
 
00:42:52.849 --> 00:42:52.859 align:start position:0%
in whatever it is that comes out of
 
00:42:54.950 --> 00:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
their particular Health assessment and
 
00:42:56.810 --> 00:42:56.820 align:start position:0%
then they'll be able to apply for grants
 
00:42:59.809 --> 00:42:59.819 align:start position:0%
in order to support whatever their need
 
00:43:01.990 --> 00:43:02.000 align:start position:0%
may be going forward
 
00:43:05.089 --> 00:43:05.099 align:start position:0%
the partnership program is also
 
00:43:07.910 --> 00:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
something that's pretty new and and
 
00:43:10.670 --> 00:43:10.680 align:start position:0%
Innovative actually for the child care
 
00:43:13.870 --> 00:43:13.880 align:start position:0%
industry as Miss barter was describing
 
00:43:17.569 --> 00:43:17.579 align:start position:0%
that you know really this child care
 
00:43:19.490 --> 00:43:19.500 align:start position:0%
does support
 
00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
all other Industries and in order to
 
00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:25.200 align:start position:0%
support their Workforce Child Care
 
00:43:27.109 --> 00:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
Workforce needs to be supported and
 
00:43:30.050 --> 00:43:30.060 align:start position:0%
strengthened so the partnership program
 
00:43:32.870 --> 00:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
is really exactly that it's working with
 
00:43:35.870 --> 00:43:35.880 align:start position:0%
the employer Community to try to have
 
00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
those conversations come up with other
 
00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
innovative ideas moving forward how can
 
00:43:43.190 --> 00:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
we can work together to solve the
 
00:43:46.490 --> 00:43:46.500 align:start position:0%
problems in child care today so that we
 
00:43:49.309 --> 00:43:49.319 align:start position:0%
know that families would have access to
 
00:43:51.530 --> 00:43:51.540 align:start position:0%
affordable child care across the state
 
00:43:54.290 --> 00:43:54.300 align:start position:0%
not just in your traditional hours but
 
00:43:56.930 --> 00:43:56.940 align:start position:0%
non-traditional hours as well we have of
 
00:43:58.370 --> 00:43:58.380 align:start position:0%
course a number of Industries in New
 
00:44:00.109 --> 00:44:00.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that work second and third
 
00:44:00.119 --> 00:44:01.370 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that work second and third
shift

00:44:01.370 --> 00:44:01.380 align:start position:0%
shift
 
00:44:03.530 --> 00:44:03.540 align:start position:0%
we want to be able to support those
 
00:44:07.370 --> 00:44:07.380 align:start position:0%
families as well as much as we can
 
00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:09.240 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
00:44:11.150 --> 00:44:11.160 align:start position:0%
well it's a little surprised to hear you
 
00:44:12.829 --> 00:44:12.839 align:start position:0%
say that this is a New Concept because
 
00:44:14.829 --> 00:44:14.839 align:start position:0%
my my
 
00:44:17.150 --> 00:44:17.160 align:start position:0%
anecdotal understanding and it's just
 
00:44:20.210 --> 00:44:20.220 align:start position:0%
one or two or three places in various
 
00:44:23.329 --> 00:44:23.339 align:start position:0%
parts of the state was that some of
 
00:44:26.089 --> 00:44:26.099 align:start position:0%
these programs had existed for quite
 
00:44:29.210 --> 00:44:29.220 align:start position:0%
some time and just as you said the costs
 
00:44:33.530 --> 00:44:33.540 align:start position:0%
got to the point where the businesses
 
00:44:36.109 --> 00:44:36.119 align:start position:0%
could not sustain their contributions
 
00:44:41.390 --> 00:44:41.400 align:start position:0%
and and I'm thinking maybe an HTI had a
 
00:44:44.690 --> 00:44:44.700 align:start position:0%
program and they had to give it up and I
 
00:44:46.490 --> 00:44:46.500 align:start position:0%
think it was taken over by a provider
 
00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
but not sure don't know what the status
 
00:44:51.170 --> 00:44:51.180 align:start position:0%
is now but
 
00:44:51.180 --> 00:44:52.250 align:start position:0%
is now but
um

00:44:52.250 --> 00:44:52.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:54.670 --> 00:44:54.680 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm
 
00:44:56.510 --> 00:44:56.520 align:start position:0%
concerned about the fact that we're
 
00:44:58.370 --> 00:44:58.380 align:start position:0%
actually currently we're going in the
 
00:45:00.170 --> 00:45:00.180 align:start position:0%
wrong direction on that and I'm hoping
 
00:45:03.710 --> 00:45:03.720 align:start position:0%
that this is a turnaround
 
00:45:06.230 --> 00:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
excuse me I absolutely I know exactly
 
00:45:07.609 --> 00:45:07.619 align:start position:0%
what you're saying
 
00:45:10.430 --> 00:45:10.440 align:start position:0%
um having more people involved in having
 
00:45:12.290 --> 00:45:12.300 align:start position:0%
businesses create Child Care programs
 
00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
are probably not going to be the
 
00:45:15.410 --> 00:45:15.420 align:start position:0%
solution that is probably not going to
 
00:45:17.930 --> 00:45:17.940 align:start position:0%
do it okay it's just too expensive and
 
00:45:20.569 --> 00:45:20.579 align:start position:0%
child care is sort of crazy I mean if
 
00:45:22.250 --> 00:45:22.260 align:start position:0%
you look at our budgets they do not make
 
00:45:24.349 --> 00:45:24.359 align:start position:0%
sense somehow we make it work but it it
 
00:45:29.150 --> 00:45:29.160 align:start position:0%
is a very very tight margin I think what
 
00:45:31.130 --> 00:45:31.140 align:start position:0%
Miss Hebert was saying what the support
 
00:45:32.750 --> 00:45:32.760 align:start position:0%
may be having the conversations about
 
00:45:34.910 --> 00:45:34.920 align:start position:0%
how can we lower your overhead how could
 
00:45:38.030 --> 00:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
we as a business perhaps could purchase
 
00:45:39.770 --> 00:45:39.780 align:start position:0%
spaces from you so those spaces are
 
00:45:42.230 --> 00:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
available when we have staff who need to
 
00:45:44.210 --> 00:45:44.220 align:start position:0%
have child care needs
 
00:45:45.470 --> 00:45:45.480 align:start position:0%
um I know there's been some
 
00:45:47.750 --> 00:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
conversations with DHHS about purchasing
 
00:45:50.329 --> 00:45:50.339 align:start position:0%
spaces for protective children because
 
00:45:52.550 --> 00:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
right now children who are in protective
 
00:45:54.290 --> 00:45:54.300 align:start position:0%
services are not guaranteed Child Care
 
00:45:55.849 --> 00:45:55.859 align:start position:0%
spaces because there just are not enough
 
00:45:58.309 --> 00:45:58.319 align:start position:0%
available so those sort of innovative
 
00:46:00.230 --> 00:46:00.240 align:start position:0%
relationships I think will probably be
 
00:46:03.230 --> 00:46:03.240 align:start position:0%
the future of business and child care
 
00:46:06.050 --> 00:46:06.060 align:start position:0%
partnership ships okay so it's a
 
00:46:09.530 --> 00:46:09.540 align:start position:0%
changing model it's a changing model yes
 
00:46:13.190 --> 00:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant thank you Mr
 
00:46:16.130 --> 00:46:16.140 align:start position:0%
I find it kind of ironic that the real
 
00:46:19.430 --> 00:46:19.440 align:start position:0%
benefit to child care to a large degree
 
00:46:22.190 --> 00:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
is the business community
 
00:46:24.950 --> 00:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
yeah what I'm struggling with is the
 
00:46:27.050 --> 00:46:27.060 align:start position:0%
lack of their willingness to step to the
 
00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
plate to help solve the problem so why
 
00:46:30.290 --> 00:46:30.300 align:start position:0%
are they looking to the government to
 
00:46:32.270 --> 00:46:32.280 align:start position:0%
solve their problem when they could be
 
00:46:33.710 --> 00:46:33.720 align:start position:0%
doing more of this on their own and
 
00:46:36.230 --> 00:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
helping you out directly to solve
 
00:46:37.790 --> 00:46:37.800 align:start position:0%
something that they will truly benefit
 
00:46:40.010 --> 00:46:40.020 align:start position:0%
from ultimately we all do because if the
 
00:46:42.170 --> 00:46:42.180 align:start position:0%
economy goes up we all benefit from it
 
00:46:45.170 --> 00:46:45.180 align:start position:0%
but directly it's the employee that
 
00:46:47.270 --> 00:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
benefits from being employed but more
 
00:46:49.309 --> 00:46:49.319 align:start position:0%
importantly it's the employer benefits
 
00:46:50.450 --> 00:46:50.460 align:start position:0%
from the employee being there in the
 
00:46:52.309 --> 00:46:52.319 align:start position:0%
first place because I keep hearing time
 
00:46:53.690 --> 00:46:53.700 align:start position:0%
and time again
 
00:46:55.430 --> 00:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
we can't grow our business because we
 
00:47:00.589 --> 00:47:00.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:03.109 --> 00:47:03.119 align:start position:0%
and I think that's exactly right
 
00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
why we're looking at some of these
 
00:47:07.010 --> 00:47:07.020 align:start position:0%
initiatives to move forward and having
 
00:47:09.410 --> 00:47:09.420 align:start position:0%
that conversation looking at the models
 
00:47:12.170 --> 00:47:12.180 align:start position:0%
looking at how can we ensure that the
 
00:47:13.510 --> 00:47:13.520 align:start position:0%
business Community is at the table
 
00:47:16.670 --> 00:47:16.680 align:start position:0%
helping us solve the problems that we
 
00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:18.010 align:start position:0%
helping us solve the problems that we
have

00:47:18.010 --> 00:47:18.020 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:47:21.890 --> 00:47:21.900 align:start position:0%
and I agree 100 I am you know I run a
 
00:47:24.170 --> 00:47:24.180 align:start position:0%
center I am I'm in charge of a small
 
00:47:26.329 --> 00:47:26.339 align:start position:0%
business I agree it's responsibility on
 
00:47:28.490 --> 00:47:28.500 align:start position:0%
the the onus is on businesses
 
00:47:30.710 --> 00:47:30.720 align:start position:0%
however in order to build those
 
00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:32.640 align:start position:0%
relationships we might need the support
 
00:47:34.370 --> 00:47:34.380 align:start position:0%
of the State of New Hampshire and we
 
00:47:35.870 --> 00:47:35.880 align:start position:0%
might need the strength of the State of
 
00:47:38.270 --> 00:47:38.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to help us work this out
 
00:47:41.390 --> 00:47:41.400 align:start position:0%
in addition the child care Staffing
 
00:47:43.970 --> 00:47:43.980 align:start position:0%
crisis is so significant and it is
 
00:47:46.250 --> 00:47:46.260 align:start position:0%
getting worse every day this is not
 
00:47:47.630 --> 00:47:47.640 align:start position:0%
something we've been able to turn around
 
00:47:50.390 --> 00:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
we have staff continuing to leave we
 
00:47:53.210 --> 00:47:53.220 align:start position:0%
have programs continuing to close so in
 
00:47:55.849 --> 00:47:55.859 align:start position:0%
in the short term if we do not retain
 
00:47:57.770 --> 00:47:57.780 align:start position:0%
and recruit some staffing we will not
 
00:47:59.990 --> 00:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
exist for these relationships with
 
00:48:02.690 --> 00:48:02.700 align:start position:0%
businesses it is it is a dying industry
 
00:48:05.450 --> 00:48:05.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:08.690 --> 00:48:08.700 align:start position:0%
representative King
 
00:48:12.170 --> 00:48:12.180 align:start position:0%
so this is a kind of encouraging and
 
00:48:14.510 --> 00:48:14.520 align:start position:0%
somewhat puzzling at the same time
 
00:48:17.329 --> 00:48:17.339 align:start position:0%
um so the questions that have come out
 
00:48:19.370 --> 00:48:19.380 align:start position:0%
about the business
 
00:48:22.670 --> 00:48:22.680 align:start position:0%
I I I agree that the businesses
 
00:48:24.890 --> 00:48:24.900 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be creating child care
 
00:48:29.569 --> 00:48:29.579 align:start position:0%
centers but is but they it seems like we
 
00:48:31.370 --> 00:48:31.380 align:start position:0%
need to Rally the businesses together
 
00:48:35.230 --> 00:48:35.240 align:start position:0%
across the state and and
 
00:48:38.750 --> 00:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
see how they can actually support you in
 
00:48:40.550 --> 00:48:40.560 align:start position:0%
creating the centers that their
 
00:48:43.490 --> 00:48:43.500 align:start position:0%
employees need is is there a plan is
 
00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
that what this plan is
 
00:48:48.290 --> 00:48:48.300 align:start position:0%
I don't know if that's directly
 
00:48:49.970 --> 00:48:49.980 align:start position:0%
approached in this plan but it is
 
00:48:52.190 --> 00:48:52.200 align:start position:0%
something that we're looking at and you
 
00:48:53.690 --> 00:48:53.700 align:start position:0%
know some of the things that have been
 
00:48:55.370 --> 00:48:55.380 align:start position:0%
spoken about in our wages group are
 
00:48:57.829 --> 00:48:57.839 align:start position:0%
things like how many llc's are there in
 
00:48:59.329 --> 00:48:59.339 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire can there be an increase
 
00:49:01.250 --> 00:49:01.260 align:start position:0%
in the LLC
 
00:49:01.260 --> 00:49:02.089 align:start position:0%
in the LLC
um

00:49:02.089 --> 00:49:02.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:04.670 --> 00:49:04.680 align:start position:0%
fees every year to go towards Child Care
 
00:49:06.829 --> 00:49:06.839 align:start position:0%
is there a really logical thing that we
 
00:49:08.870 --> 00:49:08.880 align:start position:0%
are missing that's a way for the a very
 
00:49:10.490 --> 00:49:10.500 align:start position:0%
direct way for business people to
 
00:49:12.530 --> 00:49:12.540 align:start position:0%
support the child care industry because
 
00:49:15.470 --> 00:49:15.480 align:start position:0%
you're right they do need us so
 
00:49:16.849 --> 00:49:16.859 align:start position:0%
um I think we need guidance for that I
 
00:49:17.990 --> 00:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
think we need help and I think we're
 
00:49:19.490 --> 00:49:19.500 align:start position:0%
really just on the tip of the iceberg
 
00:49:21.170 --> 00:49:21.180 align:start position:0%
about the way this will look at New
 
00:49:21.180 --> 00:49:22.309 align:start position:0%
about the way this will look at New
Hampshire

00:49:22.309 --> 00:49:22.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:49:25.270 --> 00:49:25.280 align:start position:0%
could I just ask what llc's are
 
00:49:28.670 --> 00:49:28.680 align:start position:0%
limited liability oh okay
 
00:49:31.190 --> 00:49:31.200 align:start position:0%
why LLCs as opposed to all other
 
00:49:33.470 --> 00:49:33.480 align:start position:0%
corporations I honestly it's just the
 
00:49:34.970 --> 00:49:34.980 align:start position:0%
first thing that came up came into my
 
00:49:36.349 --> 00:49:36.359 align:start position:0%
mind oh yeah we're looking at all of
 
00:49:37.849 --> 00:49:37.859 align:start position:0%
those corporations it's a different
 
00:49:40.970 --> 00:49:40.980 align:start position:0%
business model and usually what an LLC
 
00:49:43.250 --> 00:49:43.260 align:start position:0%
is it made no sense in the context of
 
00:49:46.250 --> 00:49:46.260 align:start position:0%
the sentence I'm sorry
 
00:49:47.750 --> 00:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
yeah and I think that you know where
 
00:49:50.030 --> 00:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
we're initiating conversations with
 
00:49:53.210 --> 00:49:53.220 align:start position:0%
other entities that do support the
 
00:49:54.589 --> 00:49:54.599 align:start position:0%
business Community such as the business
 
00:49:57.290 --> 00:49:57.300 align:start position:0%
Finance Authority the Community
 
00:50:00.470 --> 00:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
Development Finance Authority so having
 
00:50:04.210 --> 00:50:04.220 align:start position:0%
these conversations with them as well as
 
00:50:07.010 --> 00:50:07.020 align:start position:0%
non-profit organizations it's going to
 
00:50:10.430 --> 00:50:10.440 align:start position:0%
take I think a lot of support in from a
 
00:50:12.650 --> 00:50:12.660 align:start position:0%
lot of different angles so we're really
 
00:50:15.069 --> 00:50:15.079 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of
 
00:50:21.230 --> 00:50:21.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald
 
00:50:25.430 --> 00:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:50:27.349 --> 00:50:27.359 align:start position:0%
um been a lot of discussion about
 
00:50:30.349 --> 00:50:30.359 align:start position:0%
facilitating licensing processes for
 
00:50:33.349 --> 00:50:33.359 align:start position:0%
various professions has that does that
 
00:50:35.569 --> 00:50:35.579 align:start position:0%
affect this and has that been in any
 
00:50:38.270 --> 00:50:38.280 align:start position:0%
kind of way an impediment to um Child
 
00:50:41.089 --> 00:50:41.099 align:start position:0%
Care problem or cause of it
 
00:50:44.809 --> 00:50:44.819 align:start position:0%
um it like every other piece of this pie
 
00:50:48.109 --> 00:50:48.119 align:start position:0%
it it does affect it and so I always I
 
00:50:49.910 --> 00:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
always think of a child care licensing
 
00:50:51.230 --> 00:50:51.240 align:start position:0%
in our licensing regulations their
 
00:50:54.530 --> 00:50:54.540 align:start position:0%
safety regulations that exist but
 
00:50:56.150 --> 00:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
um we're so over regulated there's over
 
00:50:57.589 --> 00:50:57.599 align:start position:0%
a thousand of them so no human being
 
00:50:59.470 --> 00:50:59.480 align:start position:0%
could have possibly know all of them and
 
00:51:02.510 --> 00:51:02.520 align:start position:0%
they do chip away at how much it costs
 
00:51:04.970 --> 00:51:04.980 align:start position:0%
for us to do business so someone might
 
00:51:07.309 --> 00:51:07.319 align:start position:0%
eat something on a playground like might
 
00:51:09.650 --> 00:51:09.660 align:start position:0%
need a rock on a playground and all of a
 
00:51:10.910 --> 00:51:10.920 align:start position:0%
sudden we're Banning rocks on
 
00:51:12.109 --> 00:51:12.119 align:start position:0%
playgrounds and then you have to hire
 
00:51:13.490 --> 00:51:13.500 align:start position:0%
someone to get all the Rocks off your
 
00:51:15.829 --> 00:51:15.839 align:start position:0%
playground so yes I think regulations do
 
00:51:17.990 --> 00:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
affect us I don't think I think the
 
00:51:19.970 --> 00:51:19.980 align:start position:0%
majority of them are health and safety
 
00:51:22.010 --> 00:51:22.020 align:start position:0%
related and truly should be there to
 
00:51:23.630 --> 00:51:23.640 align:start position:0%
support families and to know that
 
00:51:25.670 --> 00:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
they're getting safe care but I do I do
 
00:51:27.349 --> 00:51:27.359 align:start position:0%
agree that our licensing regulations are
 
00:51:29.569 --> 00:51:29.579 align:start position:0%
worth looking at have you had a chat
 
00:51:31.970 --> 00:51:31.980 align:start position:0%
recently with Lindsey Courtney and oplc
 
00:51:34.430 --> 00:51:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:37.430 --> 00:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
um is I'm sorry is that the office of
 
00:51:40.030 --> 00:51:40.040 align:start position:0%
professional licensure and certification
 
00:51:43.250 --> 00:51:43.260 align:start position:0%
I personally have not we we tend the
 
00:51:44.750 --> 00:51:44.760 align:start position:0%
last legis
 
00:51:45.890 --> 00:51:45.900 align:start position:0%
lative advisory Council in early
 
00:51:47.870 --> 00:51:47.880 align:start position:0%
learning New Hampshire attended the last
 
00:51:50.150 --> 00:51:50.160 align:start position:0%
group of the special committee to look
 
00:51:53.089 --> 00:51:53.099 align:start position:0%
at child care rules and regulations and
 
00:51:55.130 --> 00:51:55.140 align:start position:0%
they were asking us about our opinions
 
00:51:57.589 --> 00:51:57.599 align:start position:0%
on child care licensing also so yeah I
 
00:51:59.089 --> 00:51:59.099 align:start position:0%
was there I think I asked yes yes yes
 
00:52:08.930 --> 00:52:08.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:10.910 --> 00:52:10.920 align:start position:0%
patients came out because we wanted to
 
00:52:12.710 --> 00:52:12.720 align:start position:0%
give child care providers a real chance
 
00:52:14.750 --> 00:52:14.760 align:start position:0%
to have an honest conversation about the
 
00:52:15.829 --> 00:52:15.839 align:start position:0%
things that were working and the things
 
00:52:19.250 --> 00:52:19.260 align:start position:0%
that weren't and we did create a list of
 
00:52:20.930 --> 00:52:20.940 align:start position:0%
recommendations from that some of which
 
00:52:24.170 --> 00:52:24.180 align:start position:0%
were adopted some of which were not
 
00:52:25.970 --> 00:52:25.980 align:start position:0%
I just want to add that so the
 
00:52:27.890 --> 00:52:27.900 align:start position:0%
Department's child care licensing unit
 
00:52:30.589 --> 00:52:30.599 align:start position:0%
is the unit that administers and
 
00:52:33.589 --> 00:52:33.599 align:start position:0%
oversees monitors licensed child care
 
00:52:33.599 --> 00:52:35.329 align:start position:0%
oversees monitors licensed child care
providers

00:52:35.329 --> 00:52:35.339 align:start position:0%
providers
 
00:52:35.339 --> 00:52:36.170 align:start position:0%
providers
um

00:52:36.170 --> 00:52:36.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:38.390 --> 00:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
so that that's the the
 
00:52:41.329 --> 00:52:41.339 align:start position:0%
yeah it's not opl it's not polc for you
 
00:52:43.309 --> 00:52:43.319 align:start position:0%
folks okay
 
00:52:45.230 --> 00:52:45.240 align:start position:0%
just just for clarification well I
 
00:52:47.569 --> 00:52:47.579 align:start position:0%
appreciate that she's got enough to do
 
00:52:49.670 --> 00:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
right now and they are wonderful people
 
00:52:51.170 --> 00:52:51.180 align:start position:0%
I think they truly have the best
 
00:52:53.450 --> 00:52:53.460 align:start position:0%
interest of children at heart but it's
 
00:52:55.730 --> 00:52:55.740 align:start position:0%
really easy to it's I think it's always
 
00:52:57.829 --> 00:52:57.839 align:start position:0%
easy to create a rule when maybe there
 
00:53:01.630 --> 00:53:01.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:04.849 --> 00:53:04.859 align:start position:0%
it is it the case now or are you
 
00:53:07.430 --> 00:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
considering the case that
 
00:53:10.130 --> 00:53:10.140 align:start position:0%
oplc is looking at that if you're fully
 
00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
licensed and have no negatives against
 
00:53:14.569 --> 00:53:14.579 align:start position:0%
you on your record in another state and
 
00:53:17.510 --> 00:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
you move here it's going to be much
 
00:53:23.569 --> 00:53:23.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:23.579 --> 00:53:28.609 align:start position:0%
 
hi

00:53:28.609 --> 00:53:28.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:30.770 --> 00:53:30.780 align:start position:0%
so for the Department oh sorry it wasn't
 
00:53:33.230 --> 00:53:33.240 align:start position:0%
on um Melissa stains here I'm the chief
 
00:53:35.510 --> 00:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
lead officer for the department and I
 
00:53:37.069 --> 00:53:37.079 align:start position:0%
oversee the Bureau of Licensing and
 
00:53:38.809 --> 00:53:38.819 align:start position:0%
certification which includes child care
 
00:53:38.819 --> 00:53:40.089 align:start position:0%
certification which includes child care
licensing

00:53:40.089 --> 00:53:40.099 align:start position:0%
licensing
 
00:53:44.329 --> 00:53:44.339 align:start position:0%
our child care licensing is it really
 
00:53:46.670 --> 00:53:46.680 align:start position:0%
has to do with the The Entity the
 
00:53:49.130 --> 00:53:49.140 align:start position:0%
program not the individuals the
 
00:53:50.569 --> 00:53:50.579 align:start position:0%
individuals have to pass background
 
00:53:52.730 --> 00:53:52.740 align:start position:0%
checks but they aren't actually licensed
 
00:53:55.549 --> 00:53:55.559 align:start position:0%
child care workers in those spaces
 
00:53:56.870 --> 00:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
that's why the office of professional
 
00:53:58.849 --> 00:53:58.859 align:start position:0%
licensure is not involved it's
 
00:54:01.309 --> 00:54:01.319 align:start position:0%
specifically just the business that that
 
00:54:03.829 --> 00:54:03.839 align:start position:0%
retains the license
 
00:54:05.690 --> 00:54:05.700 align:start position:0%
if that's helpful that's very helpful
 
00:54:13.549 --> 00:54:13.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:16.930 --> 00:54:16.940 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Merchant
 
00:54:19.630 --> 00:54:19.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
00:54:22.370 --> 00:54:22.380 align:start position:0%
in your opinion
 
00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
given the fact a lot of this is through
 
00:54:26.390 --> 00:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
regulation and through legislative
 
00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:27.950 align:start position:0%
regulation and through legislative
activity

00:54:27.950 --> 00:54:27.960 align:start position:0%
activity
 
00:54:30.290 --> 00:54:30.300 align:start position:0%
do you have any recommendations to the
 
00:54:32.089 --> 00:54:32.099 align:start position:0%
legislature itself on things that we
 
00:54:34.790 --> 00:54:34.800 align:start position:0%
could do to change either to improve
 
00:54:37.190 --> 00:54:37.200 align:start position:0%
your retention of employees
 
00:54:38.990 --> 00:54:39.000 align:start position:0%
um things that were creating a barrier
 
00:54:41.030 --> 00:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
to you having employees or the industry
 
00:54:43.609 --> 00:54:43.619 align:start position:0%
itself I mean a lot of it is how do we
 
00:54:45.710 --> 00:54:45.720 align:start position:0%
somehow work collaboratively
 
00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
with you folks and if you have any
 
00:54:53.569 --> 00:54:53.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:55.430 --> 00:54:55.440 align:start position:0%
I wish I had a better answer but it's
 
00:54:58.069 --> 00:54:58.079 align:start position:0%
really Financial so the states that have
 
00:54:59.210 --> 00:54:59.220 align:start position:0%
increased their retention and
 
00:55:00.950 --> 00:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
recruitment have increased the wages of
 
00:55:03.049 --> 00:55:03.059 align:start position:0%
child care workers usually through some
 
00:55:05.210 --> 00:55:05.220 align:start position:0%
sort of State intervention so I can give
 
00:55:07.970 --> 00:55:07.980 align:start position:0%
an example Maine our wages group is
 
00:55:10.010 --> 00:55:10.020 align:start position:0%
spoken to DHHS and Maine several times
 
00:55:11.870 --> 00:55:11.880 align:start position:0%
and what they've done is they've created
 
00:55:13.609 --> 00:55:13.619 align:start position:0%
a system where child individual child
 
00:55:16.849 --> 00:55:16.859 align:start position:0%
care providers so my staff will invoice
 
00:55:18.410 --> 00:55:18.420 align:start position:0%
monthly and they'll receive a 200
 
00:55:21.109 --> 00:55:21.119 align:start position:0%
stipend from the state to stay in child
 
00:55:23.870 --> 00:55:23.880 align:start position:0%
care and the retention rates have been
 
00:55:26.210 --> 00:55:26.220 align:start position:0%
much higher on the unfortunate part of
 
00:55:27.290 --> 00:55:27.300 align:start position:0%
that though is that New Hampshire
 
00:55:29.510 --> 00:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
providers can now move to Maine and take
 
00:55:32.030 --> 00:55:32.040 align:start position:0%
advantage of that so they're they're
 
00:55:34.309 --> 00:55:34.319 align:start position:0%
Innovative thoughts have decreased our
 
00:55:34.319 --> 00:55:35.809 align:start position:0%
Innovative thoughts have decreased our
Workforce

00:55:35.809 --> 00:55:35.819 align:start position:0%
Workforce
 
00:55:35.819 --> 00:55:38.510 align:start position:0%
Workforce
follow-up

00:55:38.510 --> 00:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:55:41.210 --> 00:55:41.220 align:start position:0%
how is that funded in the state of Maine
 
00:55:43.250 --> 00:55:43.260 align:start position:0%
is it funded through
 
00:55:45.710 --> 00:55:45.720 align:start position:0%
the business Community providing funding
 
00:55:48.950 --> 00:55:48.960 align:start position:0%
to support that or is it somehow through
 
00:55:50.569 --> 00:55:50.579 align:start position:0%
another word which we don't like to use
 
00:55:59.690 --> 00:55:59.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:01.190 --> 00:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
the Assumption was that there would be
 
00:56:03.710 --> 00:56:03.720 align:start position:0%
more federal dollars coming to support
 
00:56:05.569 --> 00:56:05.579 align:start position:0%
child care because there have been many
 
00:56:08.089 --> 00:56:08.099 align:start position:0%
federal child care bills that have not
 
00:56:10.730 --> 00:56:10.740 align:start position:0%
really gone anywhere but when this was
 
00:56:12.530 --> 00:56:12.540 align:start position:0%
created I'm assuming they were starting
 
00:56:14.990 --> 00:56:15.000 align:start position:0%
to create their pathway when War federal
 
00:56:16.910 --> 00:56:16.920 align:start position:0%
funds were available unfortunately we
 
00:56:18.470 --> 00:56:18.480 align:start position:0%
have not heard any more about federal
 
00:56:19.970 --> 00:56:19.980 align:start position:0%
funds being available to support child
 
00:56:22.750 --> 00:56:22.760 align:start position:0%
care at least Beyond Child Care
 
00:56:26.089 --> 00:56:26.099 align:start position:0%
ccdf the state scholarship funds
 
00:56:28.130 --> 00:56:28.140 align:start position:0%
do you know of other states that have
 
00:56:29.450 --> 00:56:29.460 align:start position:0%
worked directly with the business
 
00:56:31.309 --> 00:56:31.319 align:start position:0%
Community to have the business Community
 
00:56:33.470 --> 00:56:33.480 align:start position:0%
underwrite the cost of this versus it
 
00:56:34.849 --> 00:56:34.859 align:start position:0%
going directly through a taxation
 
00:56:34.859 --> 00:56:36.410 align:start position:0%
going directly through a taxation
process

00:56:36.410 --> 00:56:36.420 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:56:37.849 --> 00:56:37.859 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately it has gone through a
 
00:56:39.770 --> 00:56:39.780 align:start position:0%
taxation process primarily Massachusetts
 
00:56:42.890 --> 00:56:42.900 align:start position:0%
and Vermont both have taxation processes
 
00:56:46.549 --> 00:56:46.559 align:start position:0%
in Philadelphia they they enacted a
 
00:56:49.130 --> 00:56:49.140 align:start position:0%
sweetened beverage tax and so for every
 
00:56:51.770 --> 00:56:51.780 align:start position:0%
Coca-Cola or every I don't know Diet
 
00:56:53.690 --> 00:56:53.700 align:start position:0%
Pepsi that you buy
 
00:56:55.910 --> 00:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
um there was a one cent tax on that it's
 
00:56:58.790 --> 00:56:58.800 align:start position:0%
created so much revenue that
 
00:57:00.710 --> 00:57:00.720 align:start position:0%
um it's more than what the early
 
00:57:02.809 --> 00:57:02.819 align:start position:0%
childhood education system thought they
 
00:57:04.910 --> 00:57:04.920 align:start position:0%
would need to to fund their system and
 
00:57:06.109 --> 00:57:06.119 align:start position:0%
the rest of it goes back into the
 
00:57:09.170 --> 00:57:09.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:11.089 --> 00:57:11.099 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:57:13.670 --> 00:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald
 
00:57:16.609 --> 00:57:16.619 align:start position:0%
getting back along that same vein and
 
00:57:18.470 --> 00:57:18.480 align:start position:0%
this may not be a fair question so I
 
00:57:21.410 --> 00:57:21.420 align:start position:0%
apologize if it isn't but
 
00:57:21.420 --> 00:57:22.250 align:start position:0%
apologize if it isn't but
um

00:57:22.250 --> 00:57:22.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:24.530 --> 00:57:24.540 align:start position:0%
you've made reference to the fact that
 
00:57:26.510 --> 00:57:26.520 align:start position:0%
Target pays as much or more Dunkin
 
00:57:28.549 --> 00:57:28.559 align:start position:0%
Donuts pays as much or more what kind of
 
00:57:32.030 --> 00:57:32.040 align:start position:0%
our child care workers they're paid by
 
00:57:34.370 --> 00:57:34.380 align:start position:0%
the hour or by salary is it an hourly
 
00:57:36.829 --> 00:57:36.839 align:start position:0%
wage go ahead
 
00:57:38.510 --> 00:57:38.520 align:start position:0%
usually hourly
 
00:57:40.250 --> 00:57:40.260 align:start position:0%
like some management probably or salary
 
00:57:42.530 --> 00:57:42.540 align:start position:0%
but it's usually hourly I can tell you
 
00:57:45.109 --> 00:57:45.119 align:start position:0%
that at my agency the average teacher
 
00:57:49.609 --> 00:57:49.619 align:start position:0%
salary is 16.79 an hour I'm a non-profit
 
00:57:52.309 --> 00:57:52.319 align:start position:0%
I have Diversified funding and I have
 
00:57:53.870 --> 00:57:53.880 align:start position:0%
tried my darndest to raise it higher
 
00:57:57.910 --> 00:57:57.920 align:start position:0%
than that and I just cannot follow up
 
00:58:00.230 --> 00:58:00.240 align:start position:0%
what kind of hourly wage are we looking
 
00:58:01.490 --> 00:58:01.500 align:start position:0%
at to
 
00:58:05.030 --> 00:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
you know make it not just better but
 
00:58:08.270 --> 00:58:08.280 align:start position:0%
I mean I know that the optimum bid might
 
00:58:10.370 --> 00:58:10.380 align:start position:0%
be a tough one that actually is an
 
00:58:12.049 --> 00:58:12.059 align:start position:0%
excellent question because we are
 
00:58:13.549 --> 00:58:13.559 align:start position:0%
looking at in our group wages group
 
00:58:15.530 --> 00:58:15.540 align:start position:0%
we're looking at different wage scales I
 
00:58:17.990 --> 00:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
think a lot of people want to equate
 
00:58:19.490 --> 00:58:19.500 align:start position:0%
child care with the public education
 
00:58:21.170 --> 00:58:21.180 align:start position:0%
system that's apples and oranges it
 
00:58:22.970 --> 00:58:22.980 align:start position:0%
really doesn't work our days are longer
 
00:58:24.770 --> 00:58:24.780 align:start position:0%
our years are longer
 
00:58:27.410 --> 00:58:27.420 align:start position:0%
um I can understand the Symmetry but it
 
00:58:28.730 --> 00:58:28.740 align:start position:0%
really doesn't work we are looking at
 
00:58:30.890 --> 00:58:30.900 align:start position:0%
lnas we're looking at the nursing
 
00:58:33.170 --> 00:58:33.180 align:start position:0%
profession as being Equitable as far as
 
00:58:35.089 --> 00:58:35.099 align:start position:0%
education is concerned and as far as
 
00:58:37.190 --> 00:58:37.200 align:start position:0%
advancement is concerned and the steps
 
00:58:39.289 --> 00:58:39.299 align:start position:0%
you have to go through to advance and in
 
00:58:42.109 --> 00:58:42.119 align:start position:0%
those cases the the living way I I'm
 
00:58:43.910 --> 00:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
going to give you a ballpark figure I
 
00:58:48.109 --> 00:58:48.119 align:start position:0%
would love it if my my 1679 was closer
 
00:58:51.049 --> 00:58:51.059 align:start position:0%
to 22 23 dollars an hour sorry about
 
00:58:53.390 --> 00:58:53.400 align:start position:0%
twenty three dollars that would be yes
 
00:58:56.510 --> 00:58:56.520 align:start position:0%
the optimum I guess yeah I I mean it's
 
00:58:58.069 --> 00:58:58.079 align:start position:0%
expensive to live in New Hampshire and
 
00:59:00.950 --> 00:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
when you raise wages it not only raises
 
00:59:03.890 --> 00:59:03.900 align:start position:0%
wages it makes it livable but it also um
 
00:59:05.930 --> 00:59:05.940 align:start position:0%
increases quality the people that would
 
00:59:07.549 --> 00:59:07.559 align:start position:0%
apply are going to be of higher quality
 
00:59:11.270 --> 00:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:13.030 --> 00:59:13.040 align:start position:0%
I am
 
00:59:16.490 --> 00:59:16.500 align:start position:0%
on the special committee on child care
 
00:59:20.150 --> 00:59:20.160 align:start position:0%
but because of scheduled conflicts I'm
 
00:59:22.849 --> 00:59:22.859 align:start position:0%
not participating as much as I
 
00:59:26.510 --> 00:59:26.520 align:start position:0%
want to and need to so maybe this is a
 
00:59:28.309 --> 00:59:28.319 align:start position:0%
question I should ask the chairman Ross
 
00:59:32.470 --> 00:59:32.480 align:start position:0%
Barry but I'm hearing
 
00:59:37.309 --> 00:59:37.319 align:start position:0%
parallel paths here how do you see the
 
00:59:40.670 --> 00:59:40.680 align:start position:0%
value of the special committee on child
 
00:59:46.730 --> 00:59:46.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:49.549 --> 00:59:49.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:51.829 --> 00:59:51.839 align:start position:0%
that's that because Child Care is such a
 
00:59:53.750 --> 00:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
problem there are a billion Child Care
 
00:59:56.150 --> 00:59:56.160 align:start position:0%
bills and I think that it's truly one of
 
00:59:57.650 --> 00:59:57.660 align:start position:0%
those industries that everybody thinks
 
01:00:00.410 --> 01:00:00.420 align:start position:0%
they can solve and I'm hoping the
 
01:00:02.030 --> 01:00:02.040 align:start position:0%
special commitment committee will look
 
01:00:03.710 --> 01:00:03.720 align:start position:0%
at all of those bills and really sort of
 
01:00:06.230 --> 01:00:06.240 align:start position:0%
find a pathway through there's I mean we
 
01:00:07.490 --> 01:00:07.500 align:start position:0%
had situations where something was
 
01:00:08.930 --> 01:00:08.940 align:start position:0%
introduced in the Senate but it was very
 
01:00:10.549 --> 01:00:10.559 align:start position:0%
close to something that was introduced
 
01:00:12.470 --> 01:00:12.480 align:start position:0%
in the house I mean that's not a good
 
01:00:13.849 --> 01:00:13.859 align:start position:0%
use of people's time and that's not a
 
01:00:15.650 --> 01:00:15.660 align:start position:0%
good use of your time so we're hoping
 
01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
that it helps streamline the process so
 
01:00:18.890 --> 01:00:18.900 align:start position:0%
we really can get to a solution
 
01:00:21.470 --> 01:00:21.480 align:start position:0%
thank you I can see that division of
 
01:00:24.349 --> 01:00:24.359 align:start position:0%
labor but collaborative working yeah
 
01:00:27.829 --> 01:00:27.839 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you I just wanted to also
 
01:00:29.210 --> 01:00:29.220 align:start position:0%
respond a little bit to the question
 
01:00:32.270 --> 01:00:32.280 align:start position:0%
about uh support from the legislature in
 
01:00:34.190 --> 01:00:34.200 align:start position:0%
the child care strengthening plan on the
 
01:00:36.430 --> 01:00:36.440 align:start position:0%
last page there are a couple of items
 
01:00:38.809 --> 01:00:38.819 align:start position:0%
identified there that really speak more
 
01:00:41.569 --> 01:00:41.579 align:start position:0%
to policy than they do the funding well
 
01:00:44.089 --> 01:00:44.099 align:start position:0%
I agree with Miss barter that funding
 
01:00:45.650 --> 01:00:45.660 align:start position:0%
and that kind of support financial
 
01:00:47.930 --> 01:00:47.940 align:start position:0%
support for the child care industry is
 
01:00:50.630 --> 01:00:50.640 align:start position:0%
absolutely necessary so that low-income
 
01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
families have access to child care and
 
01:00:56.510 --> 01:00:56.520 align:start position:0%
that we have an equitable system but the
 
01:00:58.250 --> 01:00:58.260 align:start position:0%
couple of items I just wanted to bring
 
01:01:01.069 --> 01:01:01.079 align:start position:0%
to your attention are on that last page
 
01:01:03.890 --> 01:01:03.900 align:start position:0%
and one of them relates to having
 
01:01:05.569 --> 01:01:05.579 align:start position:0%
Statewide standards for health and
 
01:01:07.670 --> 01:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
safety codes for child care that would
 
01:01:09.730 --> 01:01:09.740 align:start position:0%
be quite beneficial
 
01:01:09.740 --> 01:01:11.289 align:start position:0%
be quite beneficial
for

01:01:11.289 --> 01:01:11.299 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:01:13.910 --> 01:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
for the industry for various providers
 
01:01:15.470 --> 01:01:15.480 align:start position:0%
because they're quite inconsistent
 
01:01:16.970 --> 01:01:16.980 align:start position:0%
across the state and that's been
 
01:01:20.710 --> 01:01:20.720 align:start position:0%
challenging the other one is
 
01:01:25.250 --> 01:01:25.260 align:start position:0%
property tax exemptions for providers as
 
01:01:27.829 --> 01:01:27.839 align:start position:0%
well or Facility Owners on the condition
 
01:01:29.870 --> 01:01:29.880 align:start position:0%
that the tax credit is passed on to
 
01:01:32.870 --> 01:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
providers who are tenants so just a
 
01:01:35.049 --> 01:01:35.059 align:start position:0%
couple of items there for consideration
 
01:01:38.270 --> 01:01:38.280 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure that Ms barter and I would
 
01:01:40.370 --> 01:01:40.380 align:start position:0%
be more than happy to talk further about
 
01:01:44.890 --> 01:01:44.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:47.690 --> 01:01:47.700 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
01:01:50.750 --> 01:01:50.760 align:start position:0%
my apologies for having to step out uh
 
01:01:52.910 --> 01:01:52.920 align:start position:0%
so this may have gone over but it
 
01:01:55.250 --> 01:01:55.260 align:start position:0%
sounded like there was it relates to the
 
01:01:57.230 --> 01:01:57.240 align:start position:0%
tale of the conversation we were having
 
01:02:00.770 --> 01:02:00.780 align:start position:0%
when I came in and I did recall where I
 
01:02:03.349 --> 01:02:03.359 align:start position:0%
heard the suggestion about
 
01:02:03.359 --> 01:02:04.130 align:start position:0%
heard the suggestion about
um

01:02:04.130 --> 01:02:04.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:07.010 --> 01:02:07.020 align:start position:0%
paying for people's education a month at
 
01:02:08.089 --> 01:02:08.099 align:start position:0%
a time
 
01:02:11.030 --> 01:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
so that it's Equitable for everybody and
 
01:02:13.069 --> 01:02:13.079 align:start position:0%
it does provide this the incentive to
 
01:02:16.250 --> 01:02:16.260 align:start position:0%
stay it was in the context of a
 
01:02:20.270 --> 01:02:20.280 align:start position:0%
discussion uh about workers at a similar
 
01:02:23.049 --> 01:02:23.059 align:start position:0%
level for the Council on Aging
 
01:02:23.059 --> 01:02:24.849 align:start position:0%
level for the Council on Aging
where

01:02:24.849 --> 01:02:24.859 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:02:29.329 --> 01:02:29.339 align:start position:0%
home care workers are needed and the
 
01:02:32.270 --> 01:02:32.280 align:start position:0%
other thing that came up loud and clear
 
01:02:34.490 --> 01:02:34.500 align:start position:0%
is of course we are a long and very
 
01:02:36.770 --> 01:02:36.780 align:start position:0%
skinny State and we have a lot of other
 
01:02:40.370 --> 01:02:40.380 align:start position:0%
states around the edges and despite the
 
01:02:43.309 --> 01:02:43.319 align:start position:0%
fact that all of those other states have
 
01:02:47.390 --> 01:02:47.400 align:start position:0%
income taxes in most cases people are
 
01:02:48.890 --> 01:02:48.900 align:start position:0%
better off going to Massachusetts
 
01:02:51.950 --> 01:02:51.960 align:start position:0%
Vermont or Maine and paying their income
 
01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:54.470 align:start position:0%
Vermont or Maine and paying their income
tax

01:02:54.470 --> 01:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:56.569 --> 01:02:56.579 align:start position:0%
than they are staying in New Hampshire
 
01:02:59.510 --> 01:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
and taking advantage of the New
 
01:03:02.030 --> 01:03:02.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Advantage so I think that
 
01:03:04.370 --> 01:03:04.380 align:start position:0%
that's something for us as policy makers
 
01:03:06.589 --> 01:03:06.599 align:start position:0%
to think about long and hard I realize
 
01:03:07.970 --> 01:03:07.980 align:start position:0%
that's not anything you can do anything
 
01:03:09.650 --> 01:03:09.660 align:start position:0%
about but I think it's
 
01:03:11.750 --> 01:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
certainly coming from the southwestern
 
01:03:14.170 --> 01:03:14.180 align:start position:0%
corner it's a real issue for everybody
 
01:03:16.609 --> 01:03:16.619 align:start position:0%
seeking workers in my part of the
 
01:03:16.619 --> 01:03:18.410 align:start position:0%
seeking workers in my part of the
country

01:03:18.410 --> 01:03:18.420 align:start position:0%
country
 
01:03:19.849 --> 01:03:19.859 align:start position:0%
and I'm sorry I didn't bring the
 
01:03:21.770 --> 01:03:21.780 align:start position:0%
statistics for this but it is true that
 
01:03:23.270 --> 01:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
we in New Hampshire we pay less for
 
01:03:25.910 --> 01:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
child care we pay less Child Care wages
 
01:03:28.789 --> 01:03:28.799 align:start position:0%
than other states so yes you can go to
 
01:03:30.349 --> 01:03:30.359 align:start position:0%
any of our surrounding states and you
 
01:03:34.670 --> 01:03:34.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:37.910 --> 01:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards I I was just
 
01:03:40.549 --> 01:03:40.559 align:start position:0%
curious if I I just heard the uh the
 
01:03:42.230 --> 01:03:42.240 align:start position:0%
gentle lady on the other end of the
 
01:03:44.270 --> 01:03:44.280 align:start position:0%
table suggests New Hampshire Implement
 
01:03:49.430 --> 01:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:53.089 --> 01:03:53.099 align:start position:0%
in 2006 I ran on that and I would vote
 
01:03:56.930 --> 01:03:56.940 align:start position:0%
on it again but the fact is that I know
 
01:03:58.970 --> 01:03:58.980 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to get anywhere so I
 
01:04:02.870 --> 01:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
decided to pick my battles but yes
 
01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:04.450 align:start position:0%
decided to pick my battles but yes
proud

01:04:04.450 --> 01:04:04.460 align:start position:0%
proud
 
01:04:06.950 --> 01:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
member of the delegation from the
 
01:04:10.549 --> 01:04:10.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:14.030 --> 01:04:14.040 align:start position:0%
as a non-coca-cola drinker I do
 
01:04:17.930 --> 01:04:17.940 align:start position:0%
favor the one cent per bottle
 
01:04:17.940 --> 01:04:22.849 align:start position:0%
favor the one cent per bottle
fee

01:04:22.849 --> 01:04:22.859 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:25.970 --> 01:04:25.980 align:start position:0%
I drink both
 
01:04:28.190 --> 01:04:28.200 align:start position:0%
um we have done research on this a very
 
01:04:31.490 --> 01:04:31.500 align:start position:0%
extensive study was done in 2016 and the
 
01:04:34.549 --> 01:04:34.559 align:start position:0%
estimated revenue from this tax would be
 
01:04:36.410 --> 01:04:36.420 align:start position:0%
about 50 million dollars for the State
 
01:04:38.030 --> 01:04:38.040 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire do you think that
 
01:04:41.150 --> 01:04:41.160 align:start position:0%
drinking Coke and not Diet Coke would
 
01:04:43.789 --> 01:04:43.799 align:start position:0%
put a burden on Mr lippman in the dental
 
01:04:43.799 --> 01:04:46.730 align:start position:0%
put a burden on Mr lippman in the dental
program

01:04:46.730 --> 01:04:46.740 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:52.609 --> 01:04:52.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:54.950 --> 01:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
assistance and child care scholarship
 
01:04:58.490 --> 01:04:58.500 align:start position:0%
and and food stamps so right now we're
 
01:04:59.990 --> 01:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
we're already funding Child Care an
 
01:05:01.789 --> 01:05:01.799 align:start position:0%
awful lot if we can get them to a living
 
01:05:03.650 --> 01:05:03.660 align:start position:0%
wage we won't have to do that
 
01:05:07.970 --> 01:05:07.980 align:start position:0%
Mr chair yes you cited sort of a study
 
01:05:10.970 --> 01:05:10.980 align:start position:0%
or something back in 2016. is there some
 
01:05:12.470 --> 01:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
place that we can find that or could you
 
01:05:13.970 --> 01:05:13.980 align:start position:0%
forward it to us
 
01:05:16.549 --> 01:05:16.559 align:start position:0%
certainly um and it was a actually the
 
01:05:19.130 --> 01:05:19.140 align:start position:0%
Department of Health the DHHS Department
 
01:05:20.870 --> 01:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
of Health that's completed that work but
 
01:05:22.130 --> 01:05:22.140 align:start position:0%
I would be happy to forward it to you
 
01:05:23.569 --> 01:05:23.579 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:05:25.670 --> 01:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
representative Weber from the Republic
 
01:05:27.410 --> 01:05:27.420 align:start position:0%
of Cheshire
 
01:05:29.450 --> 01:05:29.460 align:start position:0%
and and just one more word from the
 
01:05:31.130 --> 01:05:31.140 align:start position:0%
Republic of Cheshire if we were to
 
01:05:33.470 --> 01:05:33.480 align:start position:0%
Institute an income tax we would not
 
01:05:36.170 --> 01:05:36.180 align:start position:0%
only have our income tax but we would
 
01:05:39.470 --> 01:05:39.480 align:start position:0%
have a credit against the income tax
 
01:05:42.109 --> 01:05:42.119 align:start position:0%
paid to other people so we would have
 
01:05:44.990 --> 01:05:45.000 align:start position:0%
all of the income tax that's sucking its
 
01:05:47.930 --> 01:05:47.940 align:start position:0%
way out of New Hampshire as well
 
01:05:50.030 --> 01:05:50.040 align:start position:0%
could we have a compromise that only
 
01:05:58.329 --> 01:05:58.339 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:01.690 --> 01:06:01.700 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I have other meetings that I'm
 
01:06:04.549 --> 01:06:04.559 align:start position:0%
avoiding because I'm here and I would
 
01:06:06.349 --> 01:06:06.359 align:start position:0%
like to get this conversation back to
 
01:06:09.230 --> 01:06:09.240 align:start position:0%
health and human services instead of on
 
01:06:14.089 --> 01:06:14.099 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:19.670 --> 01:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:20.990 align:start position:0%

committee how about the quality control
Council

01:09:05.630 --> 01:09:05.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:07.789 --> 01:09:07.799 align:start position:0%
um yeah the quality control Council um I
 
01:09:09.709 --> 01:09:09.719 align:start position:0%
don't think we've I don't know if we had
 
01:09:11.329 --> 01:09:11.339 align:start position:0%
a meeting since
 
01:09:12.650 --> 01:09:12.660 align:start position:0%
um the hearing
 
01:09:15.050 --> 01:09:15.060 align:start position:0%
um and now but um there are we certainly
 
01:09:17.269 --> 01:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
I'm asking has this been shared oh uh
 
01:09:19.490 --> 01:09:19.500 align:start position:0%
not yet not yet no okay but we can send
 
01:09:21.950 --> 01:09:21.960 align:start position:0%
it out to all of our stakeholders um
 
01:09:23.930 --> 01:09:23.940 align:start position:0%
some of the folks that are on the
 
01:09:26.749 --> 01:09:26.759 align:start position:0%
quality Council are also on our advisory
 
01:09:28.789 --> 01:09:28.799 align:start position:0%
committees so some of them have seen it
 
01:09:30.530 --> 01:09:30.540 align:start position:0%
but not directly with the quality
 
01:09:32.329 --> 01:09:32.339 align:start position:0%
Council itself
 
01:09:34.550 --> 01:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
was that was one of our focuses so I
 
01:09:37.189 --> 01:09:37.199 align:start position:0%
want to keep our eye on that absolutely
 
01:09:39.470 --> 01:09:39.480 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards uh thank you
 
01:09:42.829 --> 01:09:42.839 align:start position:0%
again Mr chair so the representative who
 
01:09:45.470 --> 01:09:45.480 align:start position:0%
was working on hb608 trying to
 
01:09:49.130 --> 01:09:49.140 align:start position:0%
coordinate you know what a uh a project
 
01:09:53.269 --> 01:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
plan a pilot project might look like I I
 
01:09:56.270 --> 01:09:56.280 align:start position:0%
think I heard her in the hallway as we
 
01:09:59.090 --> 01:09:59.100 align:start position:0%
passed saying that the discussions is
 
01:10:01.550 --> 01:10:01.560 align:start position:0%
around the pilot project had essentially
 
01:10:03.290 --> 01:10:03.300 align:start position:0%
collapsed and really didn't produce
 
01:10:06.830 --> 01:10:06.840 align:start position:0%
anything that people could agree to is
 
01:10:08.810 --> 01:10:08.820 align:start position:0%
um what what what what's your
 
01:10:12.110 --> 01:10:12.120 align:start position:0%
perspective of it whether or not that
 
01:10:15.610 --> 01:10:15.620 align:start position:0%
process may have triggered
 
01:10:19.070 --> 01:10:19.080 align:start position:0%
thoughts from the on the department side
 
01:10:21.649 --> 01:10:21.659 align:start position:0%
relative to
 
01:10:24.350 --> 01:10:24.360 align:start position:0%
implementing or putting together a pilot
 
01:10:26.750 --> 01:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
project that hadn't already been
 
01:10:29.390 --> 01:10:29.400 align:start position:0%
envisioned did was that a complete waste
 
01:10:32.930 --> 01:10:32.940 align:start position:0%
of time the 608 or or did some good come
 
01:10:35.870 --> 01:10:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:37.790 --> 01:10:37.800 align:start position:0%
that's why Mr Williams got out there
 
01:10:41.390 --> 01:10:41.400 align:start position:0%
your lawyer up yeah I would say I
 
01:10:42.709 --> 01:10:42.719 align:start position:0%
wouldn't say it was a complete waste of
 
01:10:45.470 --> 01:10:45.480 align:start position:0%
time now I I do think having those
 
01:10:48.050 --> 01:10:48.060 align:start position:0%
conversations with Disney with the area
 
01:10:51.530 --> 01:10:51.540 align:start position:0%
agencies with the providers to start and
 
01:10:54.290 --> 01:10:54.300 align:start position:0%
to continue the conversations about our
 
01:10:55.970 --> 01:10:55.980 align:start position:0%
two tracks you know our compliance
 
01:10:55.980 --> 01:10:57.790 align:start position:0%
two tracks you know our compliance
deadline

01:10:57.790 --> 01:10:57.800 align:start position:0%
deadline
 
01:11:02.209 --> 01:11:02.219 align:start position:0%
plan but also the piloting of additional
 
01:11:04.490 --> 01:11:04.500 align:start position:0%
services and rates in the future I think
 
01:11:07.669 --> 01:11:07.679 align:start position:0%
it was a good opportunity to start and
 
01:11:09.590 --> 01:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
continue to have those conversations on
 
01:11:11.050 --> 01:11:11.060 align:start position:0%
the books
 
01:11:14.390 --> 01:11:14.400 align:start position:0%
follow up so so since you got something
 
01:11:15.669 --> 01:11:15.679 align:start position:0%
out of it
 
01:11:19.130 --> 01:11:19.140 align:start position:0%
is that is that bill worthwhile at all
 
01:11:21.290 --> 01:11:21.300 align:start position:0%
at this point is it it's you it's become
 
01:11:24.410 --> 01:11:24.420 align:start position:0%
overcome by events because you all are
 
01:11:26.510 --> 01:11:26.520 align:start position:0%
already now actively planning and
 
01:11:28.550 --> 01:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
communicating and working together yeah
 
01:11:31.250 --> 01:11:31.260 align:start position:0%
yeah I would say that for I don't think
 
01:11:33.229 --> 01:11:33.239 align:start position:0%
what was in that legislation needed to
 
01:11:35.390 --> 01:11:35.400 align:start position:0%
be legislated I think it needed to
 
01:11:37.250 --> 01:11:37.260 align:start position:0%
prompt and open up the discussions
 
01:11:39.410 --> 01:11:39.420 align:start position:0%
between all of the stakeholders that are
 
01:11:41.149 --> 01:11:41.159 align:start position:0%
a part of that and I think that did
 
01:11:43.130 --> 01:11:43.140 align:start position:0%
support that conversation
 
01:11:45.010 --> 01:11:45.020 align:start position:0%
um I do think there is still some
 
01:11:47.330 --> 01:11:47.340 align:start position:0%
disagreement even within the stakeholder
 
01:11:49.490 --> 01:11:49.500 align:start position:0%
Community about you know when and who
 
01:11:52.310 --> 01:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
and where things should be piloted we've
 
01:11:54.350 --> 01:11:54.360 align:start position:0%
been within their own organizations but
 
01:11:56.750 --> 01:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
I think it it sparked more conversation
 
01:11:58.729 --> 01:11:58.739 align:start position:0%
right one one more follow-up and then
 
01:12:00.290 --> 01:12:00.300 align:start position:0%
hold on
 
01:12:03.890 --> 01:12:03.900 align:start position:0%
um okay so it every time we have an
 
01:12:06.169 --> 01:12:06.179 align:start position:0%
opportunity in this committee to talk
 
01:12:10.010 --> 01:12:10.020 align:start position:0%
about the the DD Community we talk about
 
01:12:14.149 --> 01:12:14.159 align:start position:0%
the DD wait list and we keep getting
 
01:12:16.550 --> 01:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
reminded that we're required by law to
 
01:12:20.870 --> 01:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
fully fund the DD wait list and so it's
 
01:12:23.930 --> 01:12:23.940 align:start position:0%
it's become routine to report that we
 
01:12:25.550 --> 01:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
have no wait list because it's fully
 
01:12:29.270 --> 01:12:29.280 align:start position:0%
funded to which the counter request is
 
01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:30.649 align:start position:0%
funded to which the counter request is
routinely

01:12:30.649 --> 01:12:30.659 align:start position:0%
routinely
 
01:12:33.649 --> 01:12:33.659 align:start position:0%
can you give us some data on what the
 
01:12:36.050 --> 01:12:36.060 align:start position:0%
real wait list is then how many people
 
01:12:38.209 --> 01:12:38.219 align:start position:0%
are standing around or doing whatever
 
01:12:41.270 --> 01:12:41.280 align:start position:0%
living their lives needing services that
 
01:12:43.729 --> 01:12:43.739 align:start position:0%
we know just aren't able to get it from
 
01:12:45.590 --> 01:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
the lack of providers or whatever right
 
01:12:48.110 --> 01:12:48.120 align:start position:0%
do we do we have a Graphic that we can
 
01:12:50.450 --> 01:12:50.460 align:start position:0%
track routinely yeah so we don't have
 
01:12:51.830 --> 01:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
that here today because I believe we're
 
01:12:54.050 --> 01:12:54.060 align:start position:0%
reporting on the wait list numbers in
 
01:12:56.990 --> 01:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
April but we are instead of just coming
 
01:12:58.370 --> 01:12:58.380 align:start position:0%
and saying you know everyone's fully
 
01:12:59.870 --> 01:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
funded there's no wait list we have
 
01:13:02.750 --> 01:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
broken it down into people who have
 
01:13:05.630 --> 01:13:05.640 align:start position:0%
funding but have not started services or
 
01:13:08.270 --> 01:13:08.280 align:start position:0%
people who have have their funding and
 
01:13:11.209 --> 01:13:11.219 align:start position:0%
started partial services so you'll see I
 
01:13:12.590 --> 01:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
think we did that the last time we
 
01:13:14.870 --> 01:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
reported out on the wait list kind of
 
01:13:17.930 --> 01:13:17.940 align:start position:0%
broke it down into those categories so
 
01:13:19.850 --> 01:13:19.860 align:start position:0%
it wasn't just about the funding piece
 
01:13:22.010 --> 01:13:22.020 align:start position:0%
it was about who was receiving full or
 
01:13:24.709 --> 01:13:24.719 align:start position:0%
partial services and why or why not
 
01:13:26.870 --> 01:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
I'm so excited by that thank you the
 
01:13:28.729 --> 01:13:28.739 align:start position:0%
geek in me is happy
 
01:13:31.250 --> 01:13:31.260 align:start position:0%
and represent chairman Pearson if I
 
01:13:34.130 --> 01:13:34.140 align:start position:0%
could just um uh address the initial
 
01:13:36.709 --> 01:13:36.719 align:start position:0%
questions and my presence here I uh for
 
01:13:38.510 --> 01:13:38.520 align:start position:0%
the record John Williams I'm the
 
01:13:39.950 --> 01:13:39.960 align:start position:0%
director of legislative affairs so I'm
 
01:13:41.930 --> 01:13:41.940 align:start position:0%
here solely in my capacity as the
 
01:13:44.149 --> 01:13:44.159 align:start position:0%
director for legislative affairs and I
 
01:13:46.610 --> 01:13:46.620 align:start position:0%
can't improve upon what director Harding
 
01:13:49.130 --> 01:13:49.140 align:start position:0%
has provided the committee I did uh the
 
01:13:50.510 --> 01:13:50.520 align:start position:0%
reason why I did come up was I was
 
01:13:52.130 --> 01:13:52.140 align:start position:0%
actually personally involved in working
 
01:13:54.169 --> 01:13:54.179 align:start position:0%
with representative Leon who spent some
 
01:13:55.790 --> 01:13:55.800 align:start position:0%
quality time with the Department to
 
01:13:58.250 --> 01:13:58.260 align:start position:0%
going over a proposal that we thought
 
01:14:00.110 --> 01:14:00.120 align:start position:0%
was a very thoughtful approach to
 
01:14:02.689 --> 01:14:02.699 align:start position:0%
address the underlying goals of the bill
 
01:14:04.850 --> 01:14:04.860 align:start position:0%
I I think that ultimately uh
 
01:14:07.310 --> 01:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
participating in the gallery watching
 
01:14:09.530 --> 01:14:09.540 align:start position:0%
the vote into discussions as it related
 
01:14:12.830 --> 01:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
specifically to HB 608 that the
 
01:14:15.050 --> 01:14:15.060 align:start position:0%
recommendation to retain that bill and
 
01:14:17.209 --> 01:14:17.219 align:start position:0%
then to have this matter heard before
 
01:14:20.149 --> 01:14:20.159 align:start position:0%
this August committee was a very good
 
01:14:23.169 --> 01:14:23.179 align:start position:0%
approach to building on the goal of
 
01:14:25.970 --> 01:14:25.980 align:start position:0%
increased communication between all the
 
01:14:28.130 --> 01:14:28.140 align:start position:0%
important stakeholders in the department
 
01:14:30.350 --> 01:14:30.360 align:start position:0%
and that concludes my commentary thank
 
01:14:33.530 --> 01:14:33.540 align:start position:0%
you representative Weber and I just
 
01:14:36.110 --> 01:14:36.120 align:start position:0%
wanted to add to that that 608 was
 
01:14:37.790 --> 01:14:37.800 align:start position:0%
retained and it was retained not with
 
01:14:39.590 --> 01:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
the intent of killing it but with the
 
01:14:41.209 --> 01:14:41.219 align:start position:0%
intent of
 
01:14:45.290 --> 01:14:45.300 align:start position:0%
it it became clear to us that
 
01:14:50.689 --> 01:14:50.699 align:start position:0%
that was a longer time frame than the
 
01:14:53.510 --> 01:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
compliance part of the puzzle but that
 
01:14:55.310 --> 01:14:55.320 align:start position:0%
this was a retention that we really
 
01:14:57.169 --> 01:14:57.179 align:start position:0%
wanted to hold on and I think I won't
 
01:14:58.850 --> 01:14:58.860 align:start position:0%
speak for anybody else on the committee
 
01:15:01.970 --> 01:15:01.980 align:start position:0%
but my sense was that uh we're all
 
01:15:03.950 --> 01:15:03.960 align:start position:0%
committed to keep on looking at that and
 
01:15:08.030 --> 01:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
pursuing it and that we have a vehicle
 
01:15:12.110 --> 01:15:12.120 align:start position:0%
for quick action in early January if
 
01:15:15.350 --> 01:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
quick action is needed and if it is just
 
01:15:17.330 --> 01:15:17.340 align:start position:0%
a Spur to action that doesn't require
 
01:15:17.340 --> 01:15:19.209 align:start position:0%
a Spur to action that doesn't require
legislative

01:15:19.209 --> 01:15:19.219 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
01:15:22.010 --> 01:15:22.020 align:start position:0%
action so much the better but I don't
 
01:15:24.830 --> 01:15:24.840 align:start position:0%
think it's I don't think it's either
 
01:15:28.130 --> 01:15:28.140 align:start position:0%
collapsed or being abandoned
 
01:15:30.169 --> 01:15:30.179 align:start position:0%
thank you for that I didn't have all
 
01:15:31.970 --> 01:15:31.980 align:start position:0%
that status and that's that's good to
 
01:15:36.169 --> 01:15:36.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:39.050 --> 01:15:39.060 align:start position:0%
but thank you so I'm on the second page
 
01:15:40.970 --> 01:15:40.980 align:start position:0%
of your handout is just
 
01:15:45.229 --> 01:15:45.239 align:start position:0%
um a an ongoing uh Milestone and kind of
 
01:15:48.950 --> 01:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
timeline of our doings in BDS as it
 
01:15:50.689 --> 01:15:50.699 align:start position:0%
relates to the systems work so you can
 
01:15:52.910 --> 01:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
see the the dark line
 
01:15:55.310 --> 01:15:55.320 align:start position:0%
um as of July 1 that's our compliance
 
01:15:57.830 --> 01:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
date for our corrective action plan for
 
01:16:01.010 --> 01:16:01.020 align:start position:0%
CMS and so I just wanted to provide you
 
01:16:02.689 --> 01:16:02.699 align:start position:0%
know what's happening leading up to that
 
01:16:05.209 --> 01:16:05.219 align:start position:0%
compliance state of 7-1 and then post
 
01:16:07.669 --> 01:16:07.679 align:start position:0%
seven one what our plans tentatively are
 
01:16:10.010 --> 01:16:10.020 align:start position:0%
and this is always a moving Target based
 
01:16:12.950 --> 01:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
on it our input from our stakeholders
 
01:16:14.570 --> 01:16:14.580 align:start position:0%
that are in our advisory groups but just
 
01:16:18.530 --> 01:16:18.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:21.590 --> 01:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
any questions on the timeline
 
01:16:28.370 --> 01:16:28.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:31.310 --> 01:16:31.320 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure exactly how to ask this but
 
01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:35.030 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure exactly how to ask this but
um

01:16:35.030 --> 01:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:37.310 --> 01:16:37.320 align:start position:0%
so I see the timeline and I see a lot of
 
01:16:41.090 --> 01:16:41.100 align:start position:0%
things have been going on before today
 
01:16:42.410 --> 01:16:42.420 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:16:46.550 --> 01:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
is what you're about to present a lot of
 
01:16:51.189 --> 01:16:51.199 align:start position:0%
um like uh the outcomes of the project
 
01:16:54.890 --> 01:16:54.900 align:start position:0%
and what happened before today yes I
 
01:16:56.510 --> 01:16:56.520 align:start position:0%
would say uh we'll talk about some of
 
01:16:58.910 --> 01:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
our Key activities as it leads up to our
 
01:17:01.310 --> 01:17:01.320 align:start position:0%
compliance State and how we're engaging
 
01:17:03.830 --> 01:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
our providers to be ready for that
 
01:17:06.169 --> 01:17:06.179 align:start position:0%
compliance State and then how we're
 
01:17:07.189 --> 01:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
going to move forward with the
 
01:17:09.530 --> 01:17:09.540 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and developing after that
 
01:17:11.689 --> 01:17:11.699 align:start position:0%
compliance date what a pilot program
 
01:17:14.090 --> 01:17:14.100 align:start position:0%
would look like as far as the
 
01:17:16.250 --> 01:17:16.260 align:start position:0%
recommendations that were made in the a
 
01:17:18.709 --> 01:17:18.719 align:start position:0%
m report
 
01:17:21.649 --> 01:17:21.659 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
01:17:23.870 --> 01:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
and I would be remiss if I didn't note
 
01:17:26.750 --> 01:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
again the concerns that I'm hearing
 
01:17:29.990 --> 01:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
regularly from my
 
01:17:32.390 --> 01:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
area providers not the service direct
 
01:17:34.430 --> 01:17:34.440 align:start position:0%
service providers but the the now
 
01:17:38.630 --> 01:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
indirect service providers about how the
 
01:17:40.370 --> 01:17:40.380 align:start position:0%
compliance is going to be implemented
 
01:17:41.870 --> 01:17:41.880 align:start position:0%
and how on Earth they're going to
 
01:17:43.370 --> 01:17:43.380 align:start position:0%
implement it when they still don't know
 
01:17:44.930 --> 01:17:44.940 align:start position:0%
what it is exactly that they're
 
01:17:47.390 --> 01:17:47.400 align:start position:0%
implementing and we're almost to April
 
01:17:50.149 --> 01:17:50.159 align:start position:0%
so I just I just put that forward again
 
01:17:52.310 --> 01:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
no I appreciate that I guess my my
 
01:17:53.870 --> 01:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
question is how are you going to
 
01:17:56.510 --> 01:17:56.520 align:start position:0%
communicate with them in a meaningful
 
01:17:58.070 --> 01:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
way so that they can get their ducks in
 
01:18:00.770 --> 01:18:00.780 align:start position:0%
a row exactly um so I think a little bit
 
01:18:03.110 --> 01:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
further along in the presentation no no
 
01:18:04.250 --> 01:18:04.260 align:start position:0%
it's fine
 
01:18:06.050 --> 01:18:06.060 align:start position:0%
yeah no we
 
01:18:08.390 --> 01:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
um you know our work leading up to now
 
01:18:10.970 --> 01:18:10.980 align:start position:0%
has really been focused on creating the
 
01:18:13.010 --> 01:18:13.020 align:start position:0%
area agency
 
01:18:15.050 --> 01:18:15.060 align:start position:0%
um rate that they'll get paid for their
 
01:18:17.330 --> 01:18:17.340 align:start position:0%
administrative costs so now that that
 
01:18:20.510 --> 01:18:20.520 align:start position:0%
has been solidified with the work with
 
01:18:22.189 --> 01:18:22.199 align:start position:0%
our stakeholder groups and the area
 
01:18:25.669 --> 01:18:25.679 align:start position:0%
agencies it's now has been submitted to
 
01:18:27.669 --> 01:18:27.679 align:start position:0%
CMS for approval
 
01:18:30.770 --> 01:18:30.780 align:start position:0%
we're now working and spending the
 
01:18:32.990 --> 01:18:33.000 align:start position:0%
majority of our focus on the actual
 
01:18:37.250 --> 01:18:37.260 align:start position:0%
provider Network I think on slide or
 
01:18:41.090 --> 01:18:41.100 align:start position:0%
page six it talks about provider
 
01:18:43.430 --> 01:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
Readiness and how do we get our
 
01:18:46.010 --> 01:18:46.020 align:start position:0%
community-based providers ready for the
 
01:18:48.050 --> 01:18:48.060 align:start position:0%
July 1 transition and then post seven
 
01:18:48.060 --> 01:18:49.669 align:start position:0%
July 1 transition and then post seven
one

01:18:49.669 --> 01:18:49.679 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:18:53.030 --> 01:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
um so we have started implementing and I
 
01:18:54.530 --> 01:18:54.540 align:start position:0%
think we had one this week we're almost
 
01:18:56.649 --> 01:18:56.659 align:start position:0%
200 providers
 
01:18:59.689 --> 01:18:59.699 align:start position:0%
attended an information session where we
 
01:19:03.649 --> 01:19:03.659 align:start position:0%
were able to have a basic um live q a
 
01:19:05.750 --> 01:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
with their questions about
 
01:19:08.870 --> 01:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
um the compliance that they need to uh
 
01:19:11.810 --> 01:19:11.820 align:start position:0%
participate in for 7-1 so we've started
 
01:19:15.169 --> 01:19:15.179 align:start position:0%
having those open Office hours will be
 
01:19:17.270 --> 01:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
every other week for providers to jump
 
01:19:20.149 --> 01:19:20.159 align:start position:0%
on and ask the department questions and
 
01:19:22.450 --> 01:19:22.460 align:start position:0%
then we'll have we do have a monthly
 
01:19:26.090 --> 01:19:26.100 align:start position:0%
provider meeting that has some sort of
 
01:19:29.630 --> 01:19:29.640 align:start position:0%
review of a policy or a procedure and
 
01:19:32.209 --> 01:19:32.219 align:start position:0%
then an open q a so we have at least
 
01:19:35.209 --> 01:19:35.219 align:start position:0%
three formal touch points open to all
 
01:19:38.330 --> 01:19:38.340 align:start position:0%
providers every month as it relates to
 
01:19:41.270 --> 01:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
their Readiness for mostly direct bills
 
01:19:46.930 --> 01:19:46.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:49.729 --> 01:19:49.739 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant thank you Mr
 
01:19:49.739 --> 01:19:50.750 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant thank you Mr
chair

01:19:50.750 --> 01:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:19:54.770 --> 01:19:54.780 align:start position:0%
during the hearing on House Bill 608 one
 
01:19:57.649 --> 01:19:57.659 align:start position:0%
of the things I heard was
 
01:20:00.110 --> 01:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
agreement on the what we're trying to
 
01:20:02.390 --> 01:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
accomplish versus the how
 
01:20:04.430 --> 01:20:04.440 align:start position:0%
so can you explain
 
01:20:06.649 --> 01:20:06.659 align:start position:0%
to me at this point in time we're
 
01:20:06.659 --> 01:20:07.669 align:start position:0%
to me at this point in time we're
building

01:20:07.669 --> 01:20:07.679 align:start position:0%
building
 
01:20:10.910 --> 01:20:10.920 align:start position:0%
the process we're building the path
 
01:20:12.709 --> 01:20:12.719 align:start position:0%
is there agreement amongst the
 
01:20:14.450 --> 01:20:14.460 align:start position:0%
stakeholder community
 
01:20:16.430 --> 01:20:16.440 align:start position:0%
on the direction and the objective where
 
01:20:19.370 --> 01:20:19.380 align:start position:0%
we're trying to go in the first place
 
01:20:21.770 --> 01:20:21.780 align:start position:0%
because if we're not in agreement to
 
01:20:23.750 --> 01:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
build something
 
01:20:26.990 --> 01:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
without having that kind of buy-in
 
01:20:28.490 --> 01:20:28.500 align:start position:0%
I think it's going to be problematic
 
01:20:29.810 --> 01:20:29.820 align:start position:0%
because then we have to go back and
 
01:20:33.169 --> 01:20:33.179 align:start position:0%
rework it and when you get into it Mr
 
01:20:34.970 --> 01:20:34.980 align:start position:0%
Edwards over here representative Edwards
 
01:20:38.270 --> 01:20:38.280 align:start position:0%
knowing I.T to what he does it's a
 
01:20:40.189 --> 01:20:40.199 align:start position:0%
significant investment both in time and
 
01:20:43.070 --> 01:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
money so how do we avoid that
 
01:20:45.590 --> 01:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
yeah I think again I think it's a it's a
 
01:20:46.729 --> 01:20:46.739 align:start position:0%
two path
 
01:20:49.850 --> 01:20:49.860 align:start position:0%
um project right so we have compliance
 
01:20:52.070 --> 01:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
that we have to to
 
01:20:55.310 --> 01:20:55.320 align:start position:0%
um achieve by seven one or our you know
 
01:20:57.169 --> 01:20:57.179 align:start position:0%
Federal funding is
 
01:21:00.709 --> 01:21:00.719 align:start position:0%
um at Jeopardy so I think anything our
 
01:21:02.590 --> 01:21:02.600 align:start position:0%
our stance is anything that's
 
01:21:05.390 --> 01:21:05.400 align:start position:0%
non-compliance related so just services
 
01:21:07.970 --> 01:21:07.980 align:start position:0%
that we want to enhance on the waiver or
 
01:21:09.590 --> 01:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
change on the waiver will be part of
 
01:21:11.930 --> 01:21:11.940 align:start position:0%
that piloting project with the
 
01:21:13.970 --> 01:21:13.980 align:start position:0%
stakeholders with the area agencies and
 
01:21:16.490 --> 01:21:16.500 align:start position:0%
providers post seven one so they'll be a
 
01:21:19.550 --> 01:21:19.560 align:start position:0%
part of Designing developing and
 
01:21:21.590 --> 01:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
measuring whether those pilot projects
 
01:21:24.490 --> 01:21:24.500 align:start position:0%
makes sense for long-term use
 
01:21:28.070 --> 01:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
along with individuals and families that
 
01:21:29.990 --> 01:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
are actually receiving the services are
 
01:21:33.169 --> 01:21:33.179 align:start position:0%
these new Services something that is
 
01:21:34.310 --> 01:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
meeting their needs or is there
 
01:21:35.750 --> 01:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
something else that we need to think
 
01:21:38.149 --> 01:21:38.159 align:start position:0%
about as a as a community for
 
01:21:40.030 --> 01:21:40.040 align:start position:0%
Disabilities that would make
 
01:21:41.990 --> 01:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
community-based living better for people
 
01:21:44.030 --> 01:21:44.040 align:start position:0%
with disabilities
 
01:21:45.770 --> 01:21:45.780 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:21:48.350 --> 01:21:48.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair when I look at the
 
01:21:48.360 --> 01:21:49.490 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair when I look at the
timeline

01:21:49.490 --> 01:21:49.500 align:start position:0%
timeline
 
01:21:52.970 --> 01:21:52.980 align:start position:0%
the I.T phase of one and two upgrades go
 
01:21:55.370 --> 01:21:55.380 align:start position:0%
live on page two
 
01:21:58.490 --> 01:21:58.500 align:start position:0%
that's clearly in May 23 Which is less
 
01:22:00.050 --> 01:22:00.060 align:start position:0%
than six weeks away
 
01:22:01.729 --> 01:22:01.739 align:start position:0%
so I'm really concerned I hear what
 
01:22:03.950 --> 01:22:03.960 align:start position:0%
you're saying but I'm concerned about
 
01:22:06.050 --> 01:22:06.060 align:start position:0%
having that buy-in
 
01:22:08.330 --> 01:22:08.340 align:start position:0%
that we actually have it are we still
 
01:22:10.070 --> 01:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
working on the buy-in before we design
 
01:22:13.370 --> 01:22:13.380 align:start position:0%
phase one and two so I'll say
 
01:22:16.970 --> 01:22:16.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:18.649 --> 01:22:18.659 align:start position:0%
with our department we
 
01:22:20.750 --> 01:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
you know have a really Antiquated I.T
 
01:22:22.550 --> 01:22:22.560 align:start position:0%
system a lot of our
 
01:22:24.590 --> 01:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
um you know payments to Providers are
 
01:22:26.990 --> 01:22:27.000 align:start position:0%
still done a manual process and then
 
01:22:29.510 --> 01:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
pushing through a system so the first it
 
01:22:33.770 --> 01:22:33.780 align:start position:0%
update is really to automate some of the
 
01:22:35.630 --> 01:22:35.640 align:start position:0%
like we have we have a functional screen
 
01:22:39.470 --> 01:22:39.480 align:start position:0%
which is part of our assessment of
 
01:22:42.050 --> 01:22:42.060 align:start position:0%
um of people coming into the system so
 
01:22:43.189 --> 01:22:43.199 align:start position:0%
that's going to be something that's
 
01:22:44.750 --> 01:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
automated I think
 
01:22:46.910 --> 01:22:46.920 align:start position:0%
in developing that functional screen
 
01:22:49.010 --> 01:22:49.020 align:start position:0%
process we do have buy-in from our
 
01:22:50.630 --> 01:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
stakeholders we had subcommittees
 
01:22:52.850 --> 01:22:52.860 align:start position:0%
working on you know does this make sense
 
01:22:55.910 --> 01:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
we've had our contractor Deloitte who
 
01:22:58.810 --> 01:22:58.820 align:start position:0%
does our I.T work show
 
01:23:01.430 --> 01:23:01.440 align:start position:0%
our providers and our stakeholders what
 
01:23:03.709 --> 01:23:03.719 align:start position:0%
it would look like in the new system so
 
01:23:05.510 --> 01:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
as we are developing these different
 
01:23:07.930 --> 01:23:07.940 align:start position:0%
phases we are including the stakeholders
 
01:23:10.370 --> 01:23:10.380 align:start position:0%
in those decisions and showing them
 
01:23:12.410 --> 01:23:12.420 align:start position:0%
physically you know what Deloitte is
 
01:23:14.810 --> 01:23:14.820 align:start position:0%
doing to create that I.T system so
 
01:23:17.570 --> 01:23:17.580 align:start position:0%
that's really the first upgrade that you
 
01:23:19.490 --> 01:23:19.500 align:start position:0%
see in the spring would be the
 
01:23:21.410 --> 01:23:21.420 align:start position:0%
functional screen and some automation of
 
01:23:24.350 --> 01:23:24.360 align:start position:0%
reporting to representative Edwards
 
01:23:27.110 --> 01:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
comment earlier about coming to this
 
01:23:30.350 --> 01:23:30.360 align:start position:0%
committee and Reporting on more service
 
01:23:33.530 --> 01:23:33.540 align:start position:0%
level as far as the wait list we do all
 
01:23:35.930 --> 01:23:35.940 align:start position:0%
of that manually with the area agencies
 
01:23:37.130 --> 01:23:37.140 align:start position:0%
to count
 
01:23:39.290 --> 01:23:39.300 align:start position:0%
people who are funded and are not so
 
01:23:42.649 --> 01:23:42.659 align:start position:0%
we're looking in conjunction with the
 
01:23:44.390 --> 01:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
area agencies and the stakeholders what
 
01:23:46.430 --> 01:23:46.440 align:start position:0%
makes sense to put in something that's
 
01:23:48.530 --> 01:23:48.540 align:start position:0%
automated where we're not writing
 
01:23:50.810 --> 01:23:50.820 align:start position:0%
counting you know numbers of people and
 
01:23:52.669 --> 01:23:52.679 align:start position:0%
then reporting out
 
01:23:56.149 --> 01:23:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:57.770 --> 01:23:57.780 align:start position:0%
anything further
 
01:23:57.780 --> 01:23:59.570 align:start position:0%
anything further
hmm

01:23:59.570 --> 01:23:59.580 align:start position:0%
hmm
 
01:24:01.729 --> 01:24:01.739 align:start position:0%
I don't think so I think he goes into
 
01:24:05.030 --> 01:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
that question we'll see you next month
 
01:24:07.750 --> 01:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
thank you all right thank you thank you
 
01:24:11.750 --> 01:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
hello yes
 
01:24:11.760 --> 01:24:18.169 align:start position:0%
hello yes
yes

01:24:18.169 --> 01:24:18.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:20.890 --> 01:24:20.900 align:start position:0%
and now the chair Rec recognizes
 
01:24:23.470 --> 01:24:23.480 align:start position:0%
representative James
 
01:24:27.610 --> 01:24:27.620 align:start position:0%
Makai in the Old Country McKay here
 
01:24:31.370 --> 01:24:31.380 align:start position:0%
and he he had asked if he could speak
 
01:24:33.830 --> 01:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
about something he'd like us uh perhaps
 
01:24:36.890 --> 01:24:36.900 align:start position:0%
to consider doing thank you Mr chairman
 
01:24:41.209 --> 01:24:41.219 align:start position:0%
uh and to the discussion we've had so
 
01:24:44.209 --> 01:24:44.219 align:start position:0%
far today is extremely pertinent in
 
01:24:46.810 --> 01:24:46.820 align:start position:0%
terms of what's on my mind
 
01:24:50.470 --> 01:24:50.480 align:start position:0%
it's not well known that the oversight
 
01:24:53.810 --> 01:24:53.820 align:start position:0%
committee has the authority and
 
01:24:56.870 --> 01:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
responsibility to form its own
 
01:24:56.880 --> 01:24:58.010 align:start position:0%
responsibility to form its own
committees

01:24:58.010 --> 01:24:58.020 align:start position:0%
committees
 
01:25:00.890 --> 01:25:00.900 align:start position:0%
and has done so in fact the chairman has
 
01:25:03.350 --> 01:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
been chair of at least two that I know
 
01:25:04.510 --> 01:25:04.520 align:start position:0%
of them
 
01:25:06.550 --> 01:25:06.560 align:start position:0%
so I'm
 
01:25:10.209 --> 01:25:10.219 align:start position:0%
advocating that we use that
 
01:25:15.110 --> 01:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
responsibility when we particularly hear
 
01:25:18.950 --> 01:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
about issues that that are chronic that
 
01:25:21.890 --> 01:25:21.900 align:start position:0%
I've been here for a long time and I've
 
01:25:26.450 --> 01:25:26.460 align:start position:0%
heard about DD issues all of those years
 
01:25:28.669 --> 01:25:28.679 align:start position:0%
so more than 20
 
01:25:33.410 --> 01:25:33.420 align:start position:0%
the other day we had a presentation in
 
01:25:35.209 --> 01:25:35.219 align:start position:0%
front of the health committee
 
01:25:38.810 --> 01:25:38.820 align:start position:0%
and it was painful to sit there and
 
01:25:38.820 --> 01:25:39.830 align:start position:0%
and it was painful to sit there and
listen

01:25:39.830 --> 01:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
listen
 
01:25:45.050 --> 01:25:45.060 align:start position:0%
and watch the the pain that was going on
 
01:25:48.110 --> 01:25:48.120 align:start position:0%
between the people who provide the
 
01:25:51.410 --> 01:25:51.420 align:start position:0%
services and who pay for it
 
01:25:53.450 --> 01:25:53.460 align:start position:0%
and the fact that they cannot
 
01:25:56.689 --> 01:25:56.699 align:start position:0%
communicate with each other
 
01:25:59.390 --> 01:25:59.400 align:start position:0%
and Charlie McMahon and I have been
 
01:26:02.290 --> 01:26:02.300 align:start position:0%
working on this for uh God only knows
 
01:26:07.129 --> 01:26:07.139 align:start position:0%
the DD wait list was a major issue for
 
01:26:07.139 --> 01:26:08.209 align:start position:0%
the DD wait list was a major issue for
years

01:26:08.209 --> 01:26:08.219 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:26:12.830 --> 01:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
so so what I'm suggesting is that the
 
01:26:15.290 --> 01:26:15.300 align:start position:0%
oversight committee used that Authority
 
01:26:19.129 --> 01:26:19.139 align:start position:0%
it's a form subcommittees we have people
 
01:26:23.810 --> 01:26:23.820 align:start position:0%
in the communities who are willing and
 
01:26:26.030 --> 01:26:26.040 align:start position:0%
able to participate
 
01:26:28.550 --> 01:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
in this including people who have
 
01:26:31.490 --> 01:26:31.500 align:start position:0%
formally been in the legislature and
 
01:26:33.830 --> 01:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
maybe for no reasons of their own are no
 
01:26:35.450 --> 01:26:35.460 align:start position:0%
longer here
 
01:26:40.310 --> 01:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
the other one that the DD one struck
 
01:26:43.310 --> 01:26:43.320 align:start position:0%
home more than anything that I can
 
01:26:46.970 --> 01:26:46.980 align:start position:0%
remember in recent years of a tremendous
 
01:26:50.149 --> 01:26:50.159 align:start position:0%
amount of pain and and that pain is
 
01:26:53.750 --> 01:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
shared by the department I'm not saying
 
01:26:56.030 --> 01:26:56.040 align:start position:0%
that Our intention is to beat somebody
 
01:26:59.090 --> 01:26:59.100 align:start position:0%
up but it is to get people to
 
01:26:59.100 --> 01:27:00.910 align:start position:0%
up but it is to get people to
communicate

01:27:00.910 --> 01:27:00.920 align:start position:0%
communicate
 
01:27:04.430 --> 01:27:04.440 align:start position:0%
the other one that keeps coming back
 
01:27:06.709 --> 01:27:06.719 align:start position:0%
over and over and over again
 
01:27:09.169 --> 01:27:09.179 align:start position:0%
is the number of people who are sitting
 
01:27:11.930 --> 01:27:11.940 align:start position:0%
I think they call them borders now the
 
01:27:14.510 --> 01:27:14.520 align:start position:0%
people who are mentally ill who are
 
01:27:18.649 --> 01:27:18.659 align:start position:0%
sitting in emergency rooms
 
01:27:18.659 --> 01:27:20.050 align:start position:0%
sitting in emergency rooms
and

01:27:20.050 --> 01:27:20.060 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:27:23.689 --> 01:27:23.699 align:start position:0%
when I drove over here today it was
 
01:27:27.890 --> 01:27:27.900 align:start position:0%
announced that there were 30 adults and
 
01:27:29.930 --> 01:27:29.940 align:start position:0%
I've forgotten the exact number of
 
01:27:33.610 --> 01:27:33.620 align:start position:0%
children that are in emergency rooms
 
01:27:37.010 --> 01:27:37.020 align:start position:0%
if they're very illegally because there
 
01:27:38.570 --> 01:27:38.580 align:start position:0%
were certain things that are supposed to
 
01:27:38.580 --> 01:27:39.669 align:start position:0%
were certain things that are supposed to
happen

01:27:39.669 --> 01:27:39.679 align:start position:0%
happen
 
01:27:43.810 --> 01:27:43.820 align:start position:0%
within so many hours of being in there
 
01:27:47.510 --> 01:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
so that it isn't to debate those issues
 
01:27:51.290 --> 01:27:51.300 align:start position:0%
but to say that the legislature has the
 
01:27:55.310 --> 01:27:55.320 align:start position:0%
authority and responsibility uh to look
 
01:27:57.790 --> 01:27:57.800 align:start position:0%
into these issues
 
01:28:02.450 --> 01:28:02.460 align:start position:0%
independently of others and
 
01:28:04.910 --> 01:28:04.920 align:start position:0%
and I think there are a lot of
 
01:28:07.370 --> 01:28:07.380 align:start position:0%
individuals who are willing to
 
01:28:07.380 --> 01:28:08.830 align:start position:0%
individuals who are willing to
participate

01:28:08.830 --> 01:28:08.840 align:start position:0%
participate
 
01:28:13.250 --> 01:28:13.260 align:start position:0%
in such a venture who have legislative
 
01:28:13.260 --> 01:28:14.570 align:start position:0%
in such a venture who have legislative
experience

01:28:14.570 --> 01:28:14.580 align:start position:0%
experience
 
01:28:16.689 --> 01:28:16.699 align:start position:0%
from the past
 
01:28:21.950 --> 01:28:21.960 align:start position:0%
it actually is is in the law and for the
 
01:28:24.050 --> 01:28:24.060 align:start position:0%
life of me of with all the piles of
 
01:28:26.270 --> 01:28:26.280 align:start position:0%
paper that accumulate I couldn't find
 
01:28:31.189 --> 01:28:31.199 align:start position:0%
the law that there's very specific as as
 
01:28:32.750 --> 01:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
to how to proceed
 
01:28:32.760 --> 01:28:34.310 align:start position:0%
to how to proceed
with

01:28:34.310 --> 01:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:28:37.790 --> 01:28:37.800 align:start position:0%
and with with what I'm discussing and
 
01:28:40.250 --> 01:28:40.260 align:start position:0%
I'm very willing to participate in
 
01:28:43.250 --> 01:28:43.260 align:start position:0%
whatever way would be helpful and I'm
 
01:28:49.550 --> 01:28:49.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:51.649 --> 01:28:51.659 align:start position:0%
anybody on the uh
 
01:28:54.890 --> 01:28:54.900 align:start position:0%
oversight committee wished to ask
 
01:28:57.050 --> 01:28:57.060 align:start position:0%
representative McKay any questions on
 
01:29:01.910 --> 01:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:04.610 --> 01:29:04.620 align:start position:0%
collection of the statute which I have
 
01:29:07.370 --> 01:29:07.380 align:start position:0%
not yet quickly been able to find is
 
01:29:10.310 --> 01:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
that somebody wanting to set up a
 
01:29:13.129 --> 01:29:13.139 align:start position:0%
subcommittee submits in writing and I
 
01:29:15.290 --> 01:29:15.300 align:start position:0%
see Mr Williams as nodding his head in
 
01:29:17.270 --> 01:29:17.280 align:start position:0%
the back which reassures me that I'm on
 
01:29:18.970 --> 01:29:18.980 align:start position:0%
the right track
 
01:29:21.830 --> 01:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
submits a proposal in writing for what
 
01:29:25.689 --> 01:29:25.699 align:start position:0%
the committee would do and you know who
 
01:29:28.129 --> 01:29:28.139 align:start position:0%
what sorts of people would be on it and
 
01:29:29.709 --> 01:29:29.719 align:start position:0%
the time frame and stuff like that
 
01:29:31.669 --> 01:29:31.679 align:start position:0%
submits it to the committee and the
 
01:29:34.189 --> 01:29:34.199 align:start position:0%
committee votes on it I think the thing
 
01:29:37.550 --> 01:29:37.560 align:start position:0%
although we have the capacity to set up
 
01:29:40.450 --> 01:29:40.460 align:start position:0%
innumerable subcommittees
 
01:29:44.149 --> 01:29:44.159 align:start position:0%
the realistic issue is that each of
 
01:29:46.370 --> 01:29:46.380 align:start position:0%
those committees if I am recalling
 
01:29:49.550 --> 01:29:49.560 align:start position:0%
correctly must be chaired by a member of
 
01:29:50.990 --> 01:29:51.000 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
01:29:54.050 --> 01:29:54.060 align:start position:0%
and given that we have members of this
 
01:29:56.709 --> 01:29:56.719 align:start position:0%
committee who regularly fail to show up
 
01:30:00.709 --> 01:30:00.719 align:start position:0%
and that those who do show up are among
 
01:30:03.229 --> 01:30:03.239 align:start position:0%
the most busy members of the legislature
 
01:30:05.750 --> 01:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
that I know of that's where the
 
01:30:08.110 --> 01:30:08.120 align:start position:0%
bottleneck is going to be so I think
 
01:30:11.689 --> 01:30:11.699 align:start position:0%
having a very specific purpose
 
01:30:16.189 --> 01:30:16.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:18.590 --> 01:30:18.600 align:start position:0%
we were able to do this I think we
 
01:30:20.270 --> 01:30:20.280 align:start position:0%
skipped one of these steps we were able
 
01:30:22.370 --> 01:30:22.380 align:start position:0%
to do this last October with
 
01:30:22.380 --> 01:30:23.689 align:start position:0%
to do this last October with
representative

01:30:23.689 --> 01:30:23.699 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:30:27.169 --> 01:30:27.179 align:start position:0%
Solway in terms of precision medicine
 
01:30:33.169 --> 01:30:33.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:36.050 --> 01:30:36.060 align:start position:0%
uh visibility of
 
01:30:36.060 --> 01:30:37.010 align:start position:0%
uh visibility of
um

01:30:37.010 --> 01:30:37.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:39.350 --> 01:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine records and we did
 
01:30:41.390 --> 01:30:41.400 align:start position:0%
this on the quick but those were
 
01:30:43.070 --> 01:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
committees that met really for about
 
01:30:44.990 --> 01:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
four or five weeks had a specific
 
01:30:47.570 --> 01:30:47.580 align:start position:0%
purpose led to some legislation then
 
01:30:52.669 --> 01:30:52.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:56.090 --> 01:30:56.100 align:start position:0%
could be done representative Merchant or
 
01:30:56.100 --> 01:30:57.770 align:start position:0%
could be done representative Merchant or
senator

01:30:57.770 --> 01:30:57.780 align:start position:0%
senator
 
01:31:00.649 --> 01:31:00.659 align:start position:0%
uh to comment on the Committees that we
 
01:31:03.790 --> 01:31:03.800 align:start position:0%
did have I've spoken to the chair before
 
01:31:06.649 --> 01:31:06.659 align:start position:0%
and we have a charter in this committee
 
01:31:08.510 --> 01:31:08.520 align:start position:0%
and it does not include Board of
 
01:31:11.629 --> 01:31:11.639 align:start position:0%
Medicine it does not include a lot of
 
01:31:14.270 --> 01:31:14.280 align:start position:0%
the other boards that are out there so
 
01:31:16.490 --> 01:31:16.500 align:start position:0%
we need to make sure that the things
 
01:31:20.390 --> 01:31:20.400 align:start position:0%
that we do are supported by our Charter
 
01:31:24.110 --> 01:31:24.120 align:start position:0%
so just a comment you know we don't want
 
01:31:26.689 --> 01:31:26.699 align:start position:0%
to go too far but Health and Human
 
01:31:29.930 --> 01:31:29.940 align:start position:0%
Services does have an awful lot of
 
01:31:34.910 --> 01:31:34.920 align:start position:0%
tentacles and a lot of things so but you
 
01:31:38.149 --> 01:31:38.159 align:start position:0%
do have to stay within the bounds
 
01:31:40.430 --> 01:31:40.440 align:start position:0%
who would rule on that Senator as to
 
01:31:44.330 --> 01:31:44.340 align:start position:0%
whether a proposal is appropriate or not
 
01:31:49.790 --> 01:31:49.800 align:start position:0%
uh the chair would make an initial uh
 
01:31:53.090 --> 01:31:53.100 align:start position:0%
ruling whether or not it was and then if
 
01:31:55.850 --> 01:31:55.860 align:start position:0%
someone on the committee objected then
 
01:31:58.129 --> 01:31:58.139 align:start position:0%
that would be the committee vote just as
 
01:32:00.490 --> 01:32:00.500 align:start position:0%
you would in any of the other
 
01:32:04.070 --> 01:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
committees that you have to overrule the
 
01:32:04.080 --> 01:32:06.410 align:start position:0%
committees that you have to overrule the
chair

01:32:06.410 --> 01:32:06.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:06.420 --> 01:32:08.209 align:start position:0%
 
right

01:32:08.209 --> 01:32:08.219 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:32:11.930 --> 01:32:11.940 align:start position:0%
Mr chair yes uh point of
 
01:32:11.940 --> 01:32:13.610 align:start position:0%
Mr chair yes uh point of
understanding

01:32:13.610 --> 01:32:13.620 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
01:32:16.430 --> 01:32:16.440 align:start position:0%
in regards to representative Weber's
 
01:32:18.410 --> 01:32:18.420 align:start position:0%
comment about this being chaired by
 
01:32:20.270 --> 01:32:20.280 align:start position:0%
somebody from this committee
 
01:32:23.510 --> 01:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
does the person who chairs the committee
 
01:32:26.270 --> 01:32:26.280 align:start position:0%
have to be in person or could they do
 
01:32:30.770 --> 01:32:30.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:32.629 --> 01:32:32.639 align:start position:0%
I don't believe we have any
 
01:32:35.689 --> 01:32:35.699 align:start position:0%
authorization to do things remotely at
 
01:32:36.649 --> 01:32:36.659 align:start position:0%
the moment
 
01:32:38.330 --> 01:32:38.340 align:start position:0%
for this body
 
01:32:45.350 --> 01:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:47.149 --> 01:32:47.159 align:start position:0%
I'll check
 
01:32:49.490 --> 01:32:49.500 align:start position:0%
I think I know the answer but I'll let
 
01:32:51.169 --> 01:32:51.179 align:start position:0%
somebody else say no rather than me
 
01:32:53.990 --> 01:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
saying no but what I'm trying to if you
 
01:32:56.629 --> 01:32:56.639 align:start position:0%
check on this Mr chair if you would
 
01:32:59.270 --> 01:32:59.280 align:start position:0%
is the community meeting here but to
 
01:33:01.310 --> 01:33:01.320 align:start position:0%
representative Weber's point a lot of us
 
01:33:03.530 --> 01:33:03.540 align:start position:0%
are extremely busy and travel time is
 
01:33:06.709 --> 01:33:06.719 align:start position:0%
hard so if there's a way to minimize the
 
01:33:08.510 --> 01:33:08.520 align:start position:0%
travel time so the committee is actually
 
01:33:10.310 --> 01:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
meeting in person
 
01:33:12.830 --> 01:33:12.840 align:start position:0%
but the chair doesn't have to be here in
 
01:33:15.169 --> 01:33:15.179 align:start position:0%
person but just participate or lead the
 
01:33:18.229 --> 01:33:18.239 align:start position:0%
committee remotely that could help
 
01:33:21.290 --> 01:33:21.300 align:start position:0%
representative Weber and I'm incorrect
 
01:33:23.810 --> 01:33:23.820 align:start position:0%
it it's not it doesn't actually state
 
01:33:25.850 --> 01:33:25.860 align:start position:0%
that it shall be a member of this
 
01:33:28.490 --> 01:33:28.500 align:start position:0%
committee it's a point of chair of each
 
01:33:31.010 --> 01:33:31.020 align:start position:0%
such body who shall be a legislator and
 
01:33:33.229 --> 01:33:33.239 align:start position:0%
who shall act as the liaison between the
 
01:33:35.810 --> 01:33:35.820 align:start position:0%
body and the oversight committee
 
01:33:37.910 --> 01:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
does not have to be a member of this
 
01:33:40.490 --> 01:33:40.500 align:start position:0%
committee and just another silent on
 
01:33:41.990 --> 01:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
that but it just says who shall be a
 
01:33:43.970 --> 01:33:43.980 align:start position:0%
legislator it doesn't say who shall be a
 
01:33:45.470 --> 01:33:45.480 align:start position:0%
member of the committee I think we've
 
01:33:47.990 --> 01:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
always sort of assumed that having
 
01:33:49.550 --> 01:33:49.560 align:start position:0%
somebody who is a member of the
 
01:33:51.229 --> 01:33:51.239 align:start position:0%
committee will provide better liaison
 
01:33:53.450 --> 01:33:53.460 align:start position:0%
than having somebody not a member of the
 
01:33:57.470 --> 01:33:57.480 align:start position:0%
committee uh the other reservations are
 
01:34:00.770 --> 01:34:00.780 align:start position:0%
that they're the authorization for each
 
01:34:03.530 --> 01:34:03.540 align:start position:0%
such body shall be repealed on December
 
01:34:06.050 --> 01:34:06.060 align:start position:0%
31st of the even numbered year at the
 
01:34:07.790 --> 01:34:07.800 align:start position:0%
biennium so it can't extend beyond the
 
01:34:07.800 --> 01:34:09.189 align:start position:0%
biennium so it can't extend beyond the
biennium

01:34:09.189 --> 01:34:09.199 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
01:34:12.709 --> 01:34:12.719 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:34:12.719 --> 01:34:16.850 align:start position:0%
and um
uh

01:34:16.850 --> 01:34:16.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:22.669 --> 01:34:22.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:26.629 --> 01:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
so it could include a senator
 
01:34:28.910 --> 01:34:28.920 align:start position:0%
and and the the
 
01:34:30.530 --> 01:34:30.540 align:start position:0%
well the other point of the
 
01:34:32.030 --> 01:34:32.040 align:start position:0%
subcommittees is they don't have to be
 
01:34:33.890 --> 01:34:33.900 align:start position:0%
composed entirely of legislators they
 
01:34:36.229 --> 01:34:36.239 align:start position:0%
can be composed of one legislator plus
 
01:34:38.570 --> 01:34:38.580 align:start position:0%
and have in the past plus other
 
01:34:42.110 --> 01:34:42.120 align:start position:0%
community members who are relevant to
 
01:34:44.649 --> 01:34:44.659 align:start position:0%
whatever the duties are
 
01:34:47.450 --> 01:34:47.460 align:start position:0%
and it says
 
01:34:51.169 --> 01:34:51.179 align:start position:0%
that we may create subcommittees task
 
01:34:53.270 --> 01:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
forces councils or other ancillary
 
01:34:55.490 --> 01:34:55.500 align:start position:0%
bodies is necessary to implement our
 
01:34:58.370 --> 01:34:58.380 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and in developing the
 
01:35:00.229 --> 01:35:00.239 align:start position:0%
bodies the committee shall take into
 
01:35:03.290 --> 01:35:03.300 align:start position:0%
account major program areas of the
 
01:35:05.870 --> 01:35:05.880 align:start position:0%
department and population served by the
 
01:35:07.850 --> 01:35:07.860 align:start position:0%
department such as public health
 
01:35:09.649 --> 01:35:09.659 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health Developmental
 
01:35:11.930 --> 01:35:11.940 align:start position:0%
Disabilities and elderly and Adult
 
01:35:11.940 --> 01:35:13.090 align:start position:0%
Disabilities and elderly and Adult
Services

01:35:13.090 --> 01:35:13.100 align:start position:0%
Services
 
01:35:16.970 --> 01:35:16.980 align:start position:0%
and so it's very clear that it's tied
 
01:35:21.830 --> 01:35:21.840 align:start position:0%
specifically to uh the departmental
 
01:35:25.790 --> 01:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
oversight which is our primary mandate
 
01:35:29.090 --> 01:35:29.100 align:start position:0%
it's not an inquiry into anything that
 
01:35:31.669 --> 01:35:31.679 align:start position:0%
impacts Health anywhere it's it's with
 
01:35:34.970 --> 01:35:34.980 align:start position:0%
relationship to the Department
 
01:35:38.510 --> 01:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
so those would be the
 
01:35:40.310 --> 01:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
um guardrails that Senator gray was
 
01:35:43.490 --> 01:35:43.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:45.649 --> 01:35:45.659 align:start position:0%
representative Weber what's
 
01:35:48.950 --> 01:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
the the number you're citing what's the
 
01:35:48.960 --> 01:35:51.050 align:start position:0%
the the number you're citing what's the
reference

01:35:51.050 --> 01:35:51.060 align:start position:0%
reference
 
01:35:53.990 --> 01:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
well as as representative McDonald
 
01:35:55.810 --> 01:35:55.820 align:start position:0%
showed me it's
 
01:35:59.390 --> 01:35:59.400 align:start position:0%
126-a colon 15 and it's in our notices
 
01:36:02.229 --> 01:36:02.239 align:start position:0%
every month when we are noticed
 
01:36:06.169 --> 01:36:06.179 align:start position:0%
that in there he he noticed that and
 
01:36:08.750 --> 01:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
slid it over to me which helped greatly
 
01:36:10.370 --> 01:36:10.380 align:start position:0%
in my researches
 
01:36:14.270 --> 01:36:14.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:18.770 --> 01:36:18.780 align:start position:0%
so representative McKay I'm
 
01:36:22.850 --> 01:36:22.860 align:start position:0%
open to one or more committees
 
01:36:25.370 --> 01:36:25.380 align:start position:0%
um would you be able to then submit in
 
01:36:28.310 --> 01:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
writing a specific proposal that then we
 
01:36:30.410 --> 01:36:30.420 align:start position:0%
could read send it to me I'll distribute
 
01:36:32.050 --> 01:36:32.060 align:start position:0%
it around to the committee and
 
01:36:34.490 --> 01:36:34.500 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you representative
 
01:36:34.500 --> 01:36:36.410 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you representative
Edwards

01:36:36.410 --> 01:36:36.420 align:start position:0%
Edwards
 
01:36:40.490 --> 01:36:40.500 align:start position:0%
so just one tip on that uh when writing
 
01:36:43.010 --> 01:36:43.020 align:start position:0%
the purpose statement if you think that
 
01:36:45.910 --> 01:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
the purpose statement could start to get
 
01:36:48.830 --> 01:36:48.840 align:start position:0%
subjected to scope creep because there
 
01:36:50.950 --> 01:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
are so many issues near it
 
01:36:53.629 --> 01:36:53.639 align:start position:0%
in a purpose statement it's sometimes
 
01:36:57.050 --> 01:36:57.060 align:start position:0%
useful to say what the committee will
 
01:36:59.810 --> 01:36:59.820 align:start position:0%
not do sort of to Define you know what
 
01:37:02.870 --> 01:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
it will do but also a key a few key
 
01:37:05.810 --> 01:37:05.820 align:start position:0%
things to say what it won't do just so
 
01:37:08.870 --> 01:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
that everyone understands it's what's in
 
01:37:16.729 --> 01:37:16.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:20.990 --> 01:37:21.000 align:start position:0%
uh we're all aware of and that have not
 
01:37:22.910 --> 01:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
been resolved
 
01:37:26.590 --> 01:37:26.600 align:start position:0%
and that if we have an unusual
 
01:37:29.450 --> 01:37:29.460 align:start position:0%
opportunity and authority to do
 
01:37:29.460 --> 01:37:30.350 align:start position:0%
opportunity and authority to do
something

01:37:30.350 --> 01:37:30.360 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:37:33.530 --> 01:37:33.540 align:start position:0%
and I think that's partly because I've
 
01:37:35.689 --> 01:37:35.699 align:start position:0%
been here so long I keep seeing the same
 
01:37:38.330 --> 01:37:38.340 align:start position:0%
things on the same people saying the
 
01:37:41.390 --> 01:37:41.400 align:start position:0%
same things so that it's a real
 
01:37:44.270 --> 01:37:44.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity because I think we've seen
 
01:37:46.669 --> 01:37:46.679 align:start position:0%
because of what the chairman has already
 
01:37:49.209 --> 01:37:49.219 align:start position:0%
done that it works
 
01:37:51.290 --> 01:37:51.300 align:start position:0%
representative McKay would you have any
 
01:37:53.209 --> 01:37:53.219 align:start position:0%
objection if the chair asked
 
01:37:55.550 --> 01:37:55.560 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards to help you in
 
01:37:58.370 --> 01:37:58.380 align:start position:0%
crafting these statements so that they'd
 
01:38:02.090 --> 01:38:02.100 align:start position:0%
be just what we need to see because he's
 
01:38:05.330 --> 01:38:05.340 align:start position:0%
done these things well before Mr
 
01:38:08.990 --> 01:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
chairman could I just make an addition
 
01:38:11.689 --> 01:38:11.699 align:start position:0%
I'm waiting to get a yes and I did yes
 
01:38:14.570 --> 01:38:14.580 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
01:38:17.090 --> 01:38:17.100 align:start position:0%
the issue with chronic problems is we
 
01:38:19.070 --> 01:38:19.080 align:start position:0%
have a number of very large chronic
 
01:38:21.530 --> 01:38:21.540 align:start position:0%
problems and I think that if you're
 
01:38:23.209 --> 01:38:23.219 align:start position:0%
going to have a subcommittee that
 
01:38:27.910 --> 01:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
addresses one chronic problem at a time
 
01:38:32.990 --> 01:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:35.450 --> 01:38:35.460 align:start position:0%
easier for everybody including the
 
01:38:38.209 --> 01:38:38.219 align:start position:0%
subcommittee to cope with
 
01:38:40.490 --> 01:38:40.500 align:start position:0%
um because
 
01:38:43.250 --> 01:38:43.260 align:start position:0%
um I I agree with representative Edwards
 
01:38:45.890 --> 01:38:45.900 align:start position:0%
the Committees that we have had that
 
01:38:47.390 --> 01:38:47.400 align:start position:0%
have subcommittees we've had that have
 
01:38:50.810 --> 01:38:50.820 align:start position:0%
been very very successful have been just
 
01:38:53.209 --> 01:38:53.219 align:start position:0%
the opposite of what you're proposing
 
01:38:54.649 --> 01:38:54.659 align:start position:0%
they have been
 
01:38:57.470 --> 01:38:57.480 align:start position:0%
a very specialized subcommittee to deal
 
01:39:01.430 --> 01:39:01.440 align:start position:0%
with a specialized and uh immediate
 
01:39:03.550 --> 01:39:03.560 align:start position:0%
problem rather than a chronic problem
 
01:39:07.129 --> 01:39:07.139 align:start position:0%
and that's no way to discourage
 
01:39:09.410 --> 01:39:09.420 align:start position:0%
the addressing of chronic problems but I
 
01:39:12.169 --> 01:39:12.179 align:start position:0%
think that I agree with representative
 
01:39:14.209 --> 01:39:14.219 align:start position:0%
Edwards that the guard rails have to be
 
01:39:16.070 --> 01:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
particularly careful
 
01:39:18.790 --> 01:39:18.800 align:start position:0%
with respect to Chronic problems or
 
01:39:21.310 --> 01:39:21.320 align:start position:0%
people will just be
 
01:39:24.229 --> 01:39:24.239 align:start position:0%
disseminating more energy than they are
 
01:39:26.570 --> 01:39:26.580 align:start position:0%
actually solving problems
 
01:39:28.250 --> 01:39:28.260 align:start position:0%
in spite of the fact that the
 
01:39:30.649 --> 01:39:30.659 align:start position:0%
subcommittee on transparency was really
 
01:39:33.169 --> 01:39:33.179 align:start position:0%
had nothing to do with the Department of
 
01:39:35.270 --> 01:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
Health the Human Services it did focus
 
01:39:37.850 --> 01:39:37.860 align:start position:0%
on one thing did his business made its
 
01:39:41.570 --> 01:39:41.580 align:start position:0%
report and away it went that that would
 
01:39:44.770 --> 01:39:44.780 align:start position:0%
be a limiting and
 
01:39:48.649 --> 01:39:48.659 align:start position:0%
if that subcommittee is satisfied with
 
01:39:50.810 --> 01:39:50.820 align:start position:0%
the work that it has done and has issued
 
01:39:52.790 --> 01:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
its report and done what it wants to do
 
01:39:55.910 --> 01:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
then it could Sunset it has to Sunset by
 
01:39:58.430 --> 01:39:58.440 align:start position:0%
the end of our legislative term and
 
01:39:59.510 --> 01:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
people could
 
01:40:02.030 --> 01:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
start another one or we could start a
 
01:40:03.590 --> 01:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
couple and run parallel and whoever
 
01:40:06.290 --> 01:40:06.300 align:start position:0%
wants to be in could be in but uh yeah
 
01:40:09.770 --> 01:40:09.780 align:start position:0%
it cannot be we have problems or it
 
01:40:13.850 --> 01:40:13.860 align:start position:0%
would be all over the map in my opinion
 
01:40:17.149 --> 01:40:17.159 align:start position:0%
so thank you thank you for coming we've
 
01:40:18.890 --> 01:40:18.900 align:start position:0%
been discussing this now for a couple of
 
01:40:21.050 --> 01:40:21.060 align:start position:0%
months and it's it's been we've been
 
01:40:23.870 --> 01:40:23.880 align:start position:0%
circling around this point and if
 
01:40:25.729 --> 01:40:25.739 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards would be so kind
 
01:40:29.229 --> 01:40:29.239 align:start position:0%
to help you draft those statements
 
01:40:31.550 --> 01:40:31.560 align:start position:0%
get them to me when you're satisfied
 
01:40:33.410 --> 01:40:33.420 align:start position:0%
with them all disseminated to the group
 
01:40:35.689 --> 01:40:35.699 align:start position:0%
and we can discuss it at that the
 
01:40:41.689 --> 01:40:41.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:44.510 --> 01:40:44.520 align:start position:0%
I know that representative Edwards has a
 
01:40:46.450 --> 01:40:46.460 align:start position:0%
few other things
 
01:40:51.960 --> 01:40:51.970 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:51.970 --> 01:40:54.950 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:40:54.950 --> 01:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:40:58.270 --> 01:40:58.280 align:start position:0%
right that's still valid
 
01:41:02.570 --> 01:41:02.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:05.810 --> 01:41:05.820 align:start position:0%
anything else from the committee
 
01:41:09.830 --> 01:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you we're adjourned
 
01:41:13.070 --> 01:41:13.080 align:start position:0%
we've got 20 minutes to spare
 
01:41:20.810 --> 01:41:20.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:23.090 --> 01:41:23.100 align:start position:0%
I was going to go up there late and ask
