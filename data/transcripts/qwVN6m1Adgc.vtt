and this is going to be my fifth term on
 
00:12:57.590 --> 00:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
environment agriculture also the fifth
 
00:12:59.350 --> 00:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
term in the legislature
 
00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:02.240 align:start position:0%
i wanted to get onto this committee one
 
00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:02.800 align:start position:0%
in my
 
00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:06.160 align:start position:0%
when i first started and i have not
 
00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
regretted that decision
 
00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
since um and i can
 
00:13:12.629 --> 00:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
reiterate what a lot of what everyone
 
00:13:14.069 --> 00:13:14.079 align:start position:0%
else has said this really is the best
 
00:13:14.079 --> 00:13:14.949 align:start position:0%
else has said this really is the best
committee

00:13:14.949 --> 00:13:14.959 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
um uh we uh
 
00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:22.240 align:start position:0%
really work in a collegial way and uh
 
00:13:26.069 --> 00:13:26.079 align:start position:0%
i would you know just like to you know
 
00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:28.480 align:start position:0%
second what uh people have said about
 
00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:30.240 align:start position:0%
leaving the politics at the door
 
00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:33.200 align:start position:0%
we focus on policy that has to do with
 
00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
environment and agriculture here
 
00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
and anything else we deal with elsewhere
 
00:13:44.629 --> 00:13:44.639 align:start position:0%
so i'm looking forward to
 
00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:47.120 align:start position:0%
getting to the work of the committee and
 
00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
uh we'll be touching on some of the
 
00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
bills that we're
 
00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
likely to be hearing a bit later on i
 
00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
assume but
 
00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
um i think this there seems to be a
 
00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
broad range from solid waste to
 
00:13:59.269 --> 00:13:59.279 align:start position:0%
agricultural issues to animal rights
 
00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
animal welfare issues
 
00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
and i think it'll keep us busy so
 
00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
welcome everyone thank you
 
00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:08.949 align:start position:0%

okay thank you and
 
00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else on the zoom call
 
00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:54.320 align:start position:0%
that i have not
 
00:15:58.150 --> 00:15:58.160 align:start position:0%
called i just uh got another text from
 
00:15:59.829 --> 00:15:59.839 align:start position:0%
representative hyland i guess that's
 
00:15:59.839 --> 00:16:00.150 align:start position:0%
representative hyland i guess that's
who's

00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:00.160 align:start position:0%
who's
 
00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:02.480 align:start position:0%
been trying to get in and she says she's
 
00:16:04.629 --> 00:16:04.639 align:start position:0%
been waiting to be let in for 20 minutes
 
00:16:04.639 --> 00:16:04.949 align:start position:0%
been waiting to be let in for 20 minutes
so

00:16:04.949 --> 00:16:04.959 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
i don't know if that helps at all okay
 
00:16:11.749 --> 00:16:11.759 align:start position:0%
um christina will you be able to take
 
00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
care of that
 
00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
absolutely and and there is one like i
 
00:16:16.629 --> 00:16:16.639 align:start position:0%
said there's one more person on that i
 
00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
can see that looks like has used my link
 
00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:28.240 align:start position:0%
all right i'm gonna continue on i guess
 
00:16:29.749 --> 00:16:29.759 align:start position:0%
for now that we
 
00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:32.560 align:start position:0%
uh so that we can kind of try to stay on
 
00:16:34.389 --> 00:16:34.399 align:start position:0%
schedule and we'll uh circle back for
 
00:16:37.269 --> 00:16:37.279 align:start position:0%
any other new members that come on
 
00:16:40.389 --> 00:16:40.399 align:start position:0%
so i did forward you all a uh
 
00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
an agenda for the this organization
 
00:16:45.509 --> 00:16:45.519 align:start position:0%
uh well i guess it's actually our
 
00:16:47.829 --> 00:16:47.839 align:start position:0%
orientation our organization
 
00:16:50.949 --> 00:16:50.959 align:start position:0%
uh one of the things that is going to be
 
00:16:52.629 --> 00:16:52.639 align:start position:0%
unique to this year for those members
 
00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:54.720 align:start position:0%
who were here in the past and
 
00:16:56.949 --> 00:16:56.959 align:start position:0%
it will be i guess just a normal course
 
00:16:57.910 --> 00:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
of business for those
 
00:17:00.069 --> 00:17:00.079 align:start position:0%
folks who are new was the the hybrid
 
00:17:01.829 --> 00:17:01.839 align:start position:0%
meeting policy
 
00:17:04.870 --> 00:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
we've uh never done zoom meetings
 
00:17:07.189 --> 00:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
in the in the past sessions other than
 
00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
we did in one
 
00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
exact session i guess this uh the end of
 
00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:12.640 align:start position:0%
last season so
 
00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
it is uh it is my desire to have all of
 
00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:16.720 align:start position:0%
us in the committee room as much as we
 
00:17:19.590 --> 00:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
possibly can because it really improves
 
00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
the experience for
 
00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
all of us as a committee and for
 
00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
all also for all of the folks that are
 
00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:28.240 align:start position:0%
testifying now all testimonies will be
 
00:17:29.669 --> 00:17:29.679 align:start position:0%
done by zoom
 
00:17:31.669 --> 00:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
the only exception to that may be the
 
00:17:33.029 --> 00:17:33.039 align:start position:0%
bill sponsor
 
00:17:36.789 --> 00:17:36.799 align:start position:0%
um if if i'm able in the room
 
00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:38.720 align:start position:0%
and we have wrong enough to to still
 
00:17:40.789 --> 00:17:40.799 align:start position:0%
maintain our social distancing i i will
 
00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
be allowed to
 
00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
let the person testifying that you know
 
00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
the sponsor and basically any reps
 
00:17:49.029 --> 00:17:49.039 align:start position:0%
that are there to speak on the bill so
 
00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
that is the only exception to that other
 
00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:52.240 align:start position:0%
than that all of the
 
00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
uh testimony that you receive will come
 
00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:55.590 align:start position:0%
uh testimony that you receive will come
in

00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
via zoom so it's going to be a hybrid
 
00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
meeting program
 
00:18:03.909 --> 00:18:03.919 align:start position:0%
anyone that is able to attend we will be
 
00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:06.320 align:start position:0%
maintaining social distancing
 
00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
you'll be required to wear a mask and
 
00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:10.880 align:start position:0%
there will be
 
00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
air handling machines that are i'm told
 
00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
are going to
 
00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:16.160 align:start position:0%
clean the room on a very regular basis i
 
00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
don't know the schedule specifically but
 
00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
we could find out if anyone's interested
 
00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:20.960 align:start position:0%
the speaker has the
 
00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh as the details on that so we're
 
00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
making our best effort to make
 
00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
everything as safe as possible for in
 
00:18:29.669 --> 00:18:29.679 align:start position:0%
person but i still do recognize that
 
00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:31.280 align:start position:0%
there are some of you that that may have
 
00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
some health concerns and
 
00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
if that's the case we're going to
 
00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:37.280 align:start position:0%
provide the ability for you to come in
 
00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:38.720 align:start position:0%
through zoom
 
00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:40.240 align:start position:0%
but as you can see we're having some

notice of absence
 
00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
so with the amount of bills that we have
 
00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
and we're trying to do them all
 
00:20:38.789 --> 00:20:38.799 align:start position:0%
uh through using this hybrid method
 
00:20:41.029 --> 00:20:41.039 align:start position:0%
we're going to be assigned uh the room
 
00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:42.640 align:start position:0%
to use for the day
 
00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
we basically they're going to have two
 
00:20:45.909 --> 00:20:45.919 align:start position:0%
or three rooms that they can set up and
 
00:20:47.029 --> 00:20:47.039 align:start position:0%
do this with so
 
00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:48.400 align:start position:0%
the committees are going to be sharing
 
00:20:50.149 --> 00:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
the rooms we
 
00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:52.480 align:start position:0%
we traditionally had met on a tuesday or
 
00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:53.200 align:start position:0%
a wednesday
 
00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
i i'm unsure right now as to what day
 
00:20:57.909 --> 00:20:57.919 align:start position:0%
we're going to be assigned to meet
 
00:20:59.830 --> 00:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a sign by the speaker
 
00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
and that's the day i'm going to have to
 
00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:03.280 align:start position:0%
work with so
 
00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
i will let you know as soon as i do he's
 
00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
trying to get all of this figured out as
 
00:21:09.669 --> 00:21:09.679 align:start position:0%
they're still assigning bills
 
00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
to the committees and once he has a
 
00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:13.280 align:start position:0%
handle on what the workload is going to
 
00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:15.200 align:start position:0%
be and what our time frame will be
 
00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
needed to do that work then they will uh
 
00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
assign us a day and we will start from
 
00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:20.710 align:start position:0%
assign us a day and we will start from
there

00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:20.720 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:22.480 align:start position:0%
he has also indicated that he'd like us
 
00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:24.320 align:start position:0%
to work a full day when we do it so that
 
00:21:26.549 --> 00:21:26.559 align:start position:0%
we can get as much in as possible
 
00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
so uh he wants us to start at 9 a.m and
 
00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
go as long as we need to or as close to
 
00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
5 as we can so
 
00:21:36.149 --> 00:21:36.159 align:start position:0%
there will be some some longer days but
 
00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
we'll certainly provide appropriate
 
00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:38.960 align:start position:0%
breaks and
 
00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
lunch breaks and things like that to
 
00:21:42.549 --> 00:21:42.559 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're
 
00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:44.480 align:start position:0%
taking care of you keeping you in good
 
00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:46.789 align:start position:0%
taking care of you keeping you in good
shape

00:21:46.789 --> 00:21:46.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
uh next on our agenda is email
 
00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
communication for legislative business
 
00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
so uh excuse me i would suggest uh
 
00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
that you you should have all received a
 
00:21:59.110 --> 00:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
notification from the clerk
 
00:22:01.029 --> 00:22:01.039 align:start position:0%
requesting what email you'd like for
 
00:22:03.029 --> 00:22:03.039 align:start position:0%
official communication
 
00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:05.360 align:start position:0%
i would suggest that you use one email
 
00:22:06.789 --> 00:22:06.799 align:start position:0%
for all of your your
 
00:22:09.669 --> 00:22:09.679 align:start position:0%
work and make sure that we have that
 
00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
email in committee as well so that
 
00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:13.280 align:start position:0%
we're getting the communications to you
 
00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
properly i know i've
 
00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
had a couple of folks that i've had to
 
00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
go in so far and fix it but just please
 
00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:21.200 align:start position:0%
make sure that we have on file and email
 
00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:22.480 align:start position:0%
to get to you so that
 
00:22:25.669 --> 00:22:25.679 align:start position:0%
we can communicate appropriately
 
00:22:29.029 --> 00:22:29.039 align:start position:0%
dress in decorum so normally when we're
 
00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
in the house
 
00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
you know when we're in committee we're
 
00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
required to dress uh in
 
00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
in business attire and i would suggest
 
00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
that the same occurs if you're going to
 
00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:38.480 align:start position:0%
come in by zoom because
 
00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
this is still a public meeting the
 
00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
public is still going to see you
 
00:22:45.029 --> 00:22:45.039 align:start position:0%
and it's important that we uh send a
 
00:22:47.029 --> 00:22:47.039 align:start position:0%
you know a good message to them that
 
00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:48.320 align:start position:0%
we're we're here
 
00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
we're dressed to be professional and for
 
00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:52.240 align:start position:0%
success and that we
 
00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
you know have the respect for them that
 
00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
we want to
 
00:22:57.590 --> 00:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
be showing ourselves and uh so i think
 
00:22:58.870 --> 00:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
it's real important that we still
 
00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
maintain decorum even though it's
 
00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:02.320 align:start position:0%
kind of nice sometimes when you're at
 
00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:04.960 align:start position:0%
home to hang around in a sweatshirt and
 
00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:07.360 align:start position:0%
sweatpants maybe but i i don't i don't
 
00:23:09.029 --> 00:23:09.039 align:start position:0%
feel that that's the best look for us as
 
00:23:10.789 --> 00:23:10.799 align:start position:0%
a committee when we're uh
 
00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
on an official uh meeting in uh
 
00:23:15.029 --> 00:23:15.039 align:start position:0%
receiving testimony so
 
00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:17.440 align:start position:0%
i would ask that you uh maintain decorum
 
00:23:19.669 --> 00:23:19.679 align:start position:0%
just as if you were in person
 
00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
any questions on that from anyone
 
00:23:23.669 --> 00:23:23.679 align:start position:0%
anything i've covered so far
 
00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
howard i i do have a question sure
 
00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:30.720 align:start position:0%

[Laughter]

00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:48.080 align:start position:0%

00:24:49.669 --> 00:24:49.679 align:start position:0%
we we should not be eating either at our
 
00:24:49.679 --> 00:24:50.230 align:start position:0%
we we should not be eating either at our
desk

00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:50.240 align:start position:0%
desk
 
00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:52.720 align:start position:0%
or on camera we want to make sure again
 
00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:54.240 align:start position:0%
that we're
 
00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:56.240 align:start position:0%
we're showing the people that we're
 
00:24:57.669 --> 00:24:57.679 align:start position:0%
interested in paying attention to what
 
00:24:59.029 --> 00:24:59.039 align:start position:0%
they're saying
 
00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:00.880 align:start position:0%
um you can have a drink you know
 
00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
typically water or
 
00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
sometimes i'll have an iced tea
 
00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:05.360 align:start position:0%
something like that uh but
 
00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:08.320 align:start position:0%
keep it down to uh you know to that and
 
00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:09.200 align:start position:0%
let's just try to
 
00:25:11.669 --> 00:25:11.679 align:start position:0%
again maintain that respect that we that
 
00:25:13.269 --> 00:25:13.279 align:start position:0%
we have for the folks that have come to
 
00:25:13.279 --> 00:25:15.669 align:start position:0%
we have for the folks that have come to
testify

00:25:15.669 --> 00:25:15.679 align:start position:0%
testify
 
00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:19.120 align:start position:0%
use of electronic devices you know
 
00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:20.720 align:start position:0%
we're living in an electronic age and
 
00:25:22.789 --> 00:25:22.799 align:start position:0%
we're all have a lot of distractions but
 
00:25:22.799 --> 00:25:23.430 align:start position:0%
we're all have a lot of distractions but
again

00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:23.440 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
the biggest thing is we want to make
 
00:25:26.549 --> 00:25:26.559 align:start position:0%
sure that the people that are testifying
 
00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:28.480 align:start position:0%
feel like we're paying attention to them
 
00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:30.640 align:start position:0%
so sometimes it's necessary when someone
 
00:25:32.549 --> 00:25:32.559 align:start position:0%
is testifying to you know they might
 
00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
cite something that you want to look up
 
00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
a specific rsa or something that you
 
00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
find of interest and
 
00:25:39.909 --> 00:25:39.919 align:start position:0%
so i would encourage you to again just
 
00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
be respectful pay attention to the folks
 
00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
that are testifying if you have
 
00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
something that you need to do
 
00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
that you want to look up then by all
 
00:25:47.269 --> 00:25:47.279 align:start position:0%
means do it but but
 
00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:49.120 align:start position:0%
sort of keep it related to what's going
 
00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
on in the room and what's going on
 
00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:54.320 align:start position:0%
relative to the bill we're hearing
 
00:25:56.870 --> 00:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
committee room drawers so when and if we
 
00:25:59.830 --> 00:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
ever do get back into the state house
 
00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:02.240 align:start position:0%
full time there are committee drawers
 
00:26:03.909 --> 00:26:03.919 align:start position:0%
that are that are in our committee room
 
00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
that you can keep your paperwork in
 
00:26:07.909 --> 00:26:07.919 align:start position:0%
currently uh that has been suspended
 
00:26:10.149 --> 00:26:10.159 align:start position:0%
because of the pandemic so if you're
 
00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
coming to the state house to be in
 
00:26:13.269 --> 00:26:13.279 align:start position:0%
person you'll need to bring everything
 
00:26:13.909 --> 00:26:13.919 align:start position:0%
with you and
 
00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
take it all back with you and it's kind
 
00:26:17.909 --> 00:26:17.919 align:start position:0%
of a pain but
 
00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:23.120 align:start position:0%
when we are in the committee room there
 
00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
are emergency procedures for
 
00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
exiting and there's signs posted on the
 
00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:28.640 align:start position:0%
wall uh
 
00:26:31.269 --> 00:26:31.279 align:start position:0%
they're showing the places we should go
 
00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
you know the correct routes to get out
 
00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:34.480 align:start position:0%
and where we should meet so
 
00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:36.240 align:start position:0%
i think when we finally get back in
 
00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
there we'll perhaps cover this a little
 
00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:37.990 align:start position:0%
there we'll perhaps cover this a little
more

00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:26:40.149 --> 00:26:40.159 align:start position:0%
in detail because kind of on zoom it
 
00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't doesn't seem as relative if
 
00:26:44.549 --> 00:26:44.559 align:start position:0%
we're not in the room
 
00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:46.960 align:start position:0%
so uh representative bolden has agreed
 
00:26:47.669 --> 00:26:47.679 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
our security notification expert
 
00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
so when we are in the committee room he
 
00:26:55.669 --> 00:26:55.679 align:start position:0%
will be seated closest to the door
 
00:26:58.390 --> 00:26:58.400 align:start position:0%
and if in the event there is some reason
 
00:26:59.190 --> 00:26:59.200 align:start position:0%
that we have a
 
00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:02.240 align:start position:0%
you know an issue and we need to alert
 
00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:03.269 align:start position:0%
you know an issue and we need to alert
security

00:27:03.269 --> 00:27:03.279 align:start position:0%
security
 
00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:05.440 align:start position:0%
he is uh he knows the protocols and
 
00:27:07.269 --> 00:27:07.279 align:start position:0%
procedures and i'll either
 
00:27:09.430 --> 00:27:09.440 align:start position:0%
you know tell him to do so or if he
 
00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:11.200 align:start position:0%
feels there's a reason he he will do so
 
00:27:13.029 --> 00:27:13.039 align:start position:0%
but we'll get that communicated
 
00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
he will uh he will be the person that
 
00:27:17.669 --> 00:27:17.679 align:start position:0%
will take care of that
 
00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:20.320 align:start position:0%
again fire alarm and exits uh those are
 
00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:20.710 align:start position:0%
again fire alarm and exits uh those are
all

00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:20.720 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
signed appropriately if you are there in
 
00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:24.880 align:start position:0%
the uh in the
 
00:27:26.710 --> 00:27:26.720 align:start position:0%
lob i guess if you're at home you're
 
00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:28.480 align:start position:0%
sort of on your own for your fire alarms
 
00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
and exits but i'll trust that you all
 
00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:35.669 --> 00:27:35.679 align:start position:0%
all right that's the end of our first uh
 
00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:36.480 align:start position:0%
section any
 
00:27:38.389 --> 00:27:38.399 align:start position:0%
questions that anybody has there or
 
00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
comments that you'd like to make
 
00:27:45.669 --> 00:27:45.679 align:start position:0%
mr chair yes um the only thing i would
 
00:27:46.549 --> 00:27:46.559 align:start position:0%
like to say
 
00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:49.120 align:start position:0%
is i just like to reiterate something
 
00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:49.830 align:start position:0%
is i just like to reiterate something
about

00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:27:53.909 --> 00:27:53.919 align:start position:0%
um electronic devices um
 
00:27:57.750 --> 00:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
it's very um important
 
00:27:59.510 --> 00:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
that the public doesn't see you
 
00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:02.480 align:start position:0%
scrolling on your phones i think it's um
 
00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
they appreciate our committee because we
 
00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
really do pay attention
 
00:28:09.029 --> 00:28:09.039 align:start position:0%
so if you i would think keep your cell
 
00:28:10.149 --> 00:28:10.159 align:start position:0%
phones off
 
00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
the table um i think isn't is important
 
00:28:17.029 --> 00:28:17.039 align:start position:0%
that's all i want to say yeah that's
 
00:28:18.549 --> 00:28:18.559 align:start position:0%
typically the rule when we're in in
 
00:28:20.389 --> 00:28:20.399 align:start position:0%
committee and thank you for uh
 
00:28:22.149 --> 00:28:22.159 align:start position:0%
for adding to that you know we we
 
00:28:24.149 --> 00:28:24.159 align:start position:0%
generally keep them under the table
 
00:28:26.389 --> 00:28:26.399 align:start position:0%
down out of sight if possible and i
 
00:28:27.909 --> 00:28:27.919 align:start position:0%
guess i would say the same to you if
 
00:28:27.919 --> 00:28:28.310 align:start position:0%
guess i would say the same to you if
you're

00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:28.320 align:start position:0%
you're
 
00:28:31.029 --> 00:28:31.039 align:start position:0%
at home in in doing this via zoom just
 
00:28:32.389 --> 00:28:32.399 align:start position:0%
again it's it's about the respect for
 
00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
the folks that are testifying
 
00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
you know they're they have taken their
 
00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
time to come in and
 
00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:39.200 align:start position:0%
in many of these bills it's a very
 
00:28:40.630 --> 00:28:40.640 align:start position:0%
passionate thing and some of them are
 
00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
pretty nervous and
 
00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:43.760 align:start position:0%
scared to to be there you know they're
 
00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
not used to speaking in front of people
 
00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:46.310 align:start position:0%
not used to speaking in front of people
and

00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:46.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:48.240 align:start position:0%
so we just want to make sure we're
 
00:28:49.669 --> 00:28:49.679 align:start position:0%
giving them our respect and our
 
00:28:49.679 --> 00:28:51.750 align:start position:0%
giving them our respect and our
attention

00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
attention
 
00:28:55.909 --> 00:28:55.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
all right i'm going to go on to the
 
00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:00.549 align:start position:0%
all right i'm going to go on to the
committee

00:29:00.549 --> 00:29:00.559 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:29:02.789 --> 00:29:02.799 align:start position:0%
so our charge is the environment and ag
 
00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:05.600 align:start position:0%
committee is covered under rule 31f
 
00:29:08.470 --> 00:29:08.480 align:start position:0%
and if you look through the material
 
00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:09.200 align:start position:0%

and so much of how we operate
 
00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:47.600 align:start position:0%

them here for me to
 
00:30:14.910 --> 00:30:14.920 align:start position:0%
peruse in the evening when i'm bored
 
00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:17.750 align:start position:0%
peruse in the evening when i'm bored
[Laughter]

00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
uh all right partisan balance
 
00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:22.880 align:start position:0%
i i think this is important to cover
 
00:30:25.029 --> 00:30:25.039 align:start position:0%
because as i said
 
00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
we typically check our uh our parties at
 
00:30:29.029 --> 00:30:29.039 align:start position:0%
the door when we come in and work but
 
00:30:29.909 --> 00:30:29.919 align:start position:0%
there is a
 
00:30:33.029 --> 00:30:33.039 align:start position:0%
a formula for how our committee is and
 
00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
and how every committee is set up
 
00:30:37.029 --> 00:30:37.039 align:start position:0%
so we have uh 19 members on our
 
00:30:38.710 --> 00:30:38.720 align:start position:0%
committee 10 of which are
 
00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:40.720 align:start position:0%
republican and nine are democrat and and
 
00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:43.360 align:start position:0%
that is basically the balance of
 
00:30:45.669 --> 00:30:45.679 align:start position:0%
how it divvies out because of the the
 
00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
balance in the house of representatives
 
00:30:50.549 --> 00:30:50.559 align:start position:0%
so when we were first elected we were
 
00:30:52.549 --> 00:30:52.559 align:start position:0%
what 218 to 182
 
00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:54.720 align:start position:0%
i think was the original since the
 
00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
passing of speaker hinch
 
00:30:59.269 --> 00:30:59.279 align:start position:0%
we uh we were down to 217 on our side
 
00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:01.360 align:start position:0%
on the republican side but but that is
 
00:31:02.630 --> 00:31:02.640 align:start position:0%
the makeup of the
 
00:31:04.149 --> 00:31:04.159 align:start position:0%
committee it's that same partisan
 
00:31:05.909 --> 00:31:05.919 align:start position:0%
balance as close as it can be to
 
00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:09.760 align:start position:0%
what is uh the makeup of the house
 
00:31:12.470 --> 00:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
but again i i can't stress this enough
 
00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:13.430 align:start position:0%
but again i i can't stress this enough
and

00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:31:15.509 --> 00:31:15.519 align:start position:0%
we we this committee has always worked
 
00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:16.840 align:start position:0%
extremely well
 
00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:20.000 align:start position:0%
together there are certainly issues and
 
00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
there may be one or two
 
00:31:24.549 --> 00:31:24.559 align:start position:0%
or a per session maybe that's typically
 
00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:27.200 align:start position:0%
about it we will see a party-line vote
 
00:31:29.509 --> 00:31:29.519 align:start position:0%
but you will find the vast majority of
 
00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
our bills will come up
 
00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:34.240 align:start position:0%
come out of our committee uh with us all
 
00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
in unison and supporting it because we
 
00:31:36.870 --> 00:31:36.880 align:start position:0%
do the work
 
00:31:38.389 --> 00:31:38.399 align:start position:0%
and we all listen to each other and we
 
00:31:41.190 --> 00:31:41.200 align:start position:0%
have that dialogue and we find a way to
 
00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
get it so that everybody can be on board
 
00:31:46.149 --> 00:31:46.159 align:start position:0%
and so i think that's real important
 
00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:49.200 align:start position:0%
um representative dixie if at any point
 
00:31:50.470 --> 00:31:50.480 align:start position:0%
in time there's something that you'd
 
00:31:52.230 --> 00:31:52.240 align:start position:0%
like to add into this by all means just
 
00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
jump in all right
 
00:31:55.509 --> 00:31:55.519 align:start position:0%
i certainly i'd just like to amplify
 
00:31:56.950 --> 00:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:31:59.830 --> 00:31:59.840 align:start position:0%
that the the nonpartisan aspect of it
 
00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:00.630 align:start position:0%
that the the nonpartisan aspect of it
and

00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:00.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:32:04.149 --> 00:32:04.159 align:start position:0%
um one of the things one one way that i
 
00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:06.240 align:start position:0%
i think that um bob hefner who was
 
00:32:07.269 --> 00:32:07.279 align:start position:0%
actually on this call
 
00:32:10.149 --> 00:32:10.159 align:start position:0%
uh phrased it this way uh when he was
 
00:32:11.029 --> 00:32:11.039 align:start position:0%
the chair
 
00:32:13.669 --> 00:32:13.679 align:start position:0%
uh when we you know when we walk into
 
00:32:15.269 --> 00:32:15.279 align:start position:0%
the ena room
 
00:32:18.630 --> 00:32:18.640 align:start position:0%
uh we uh leave our div
 
00:32:21.029 --> 00:32:21.039 align:start position:0%
we leave divisive issues that the party
 
00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
that are
 
00:32:25.029 --> 00:32:25.039 align:start position:0%
sort of party line at the door uh so
 
00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
we don't mention sort of the hot button
 
00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
issues that
 
00:32:30.789 --> 00:32:30.799 align:start position:0%
have clear partisan divides because we
 
00:32:32.630 --> 00:32:32.640 align:start position:0%
want to make sure we're focusing on
 
00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
the business of our committee and
 
00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
working on it in a non-partisan way
 
00:32:40.549 --> 00:32:40.559 align:start position:0%
thank you well said and uh we will be
 
00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
receiving a uh
 
00:32:45.269 --> 00:32:45.279 align:start position:0%
a presentation from former chairs hafner
 
00:32:46.950 --> 00:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
and sad they're both on and i
 
00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
i welcome them on i can see you're here
 
00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
and i look forward to your presentation
 
00:32:54.149 --> 00:32:54.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:57.669 --> 00:32:57.679 align:start position:0%
okay uh committee seating you will see
 
00:32:59.509 --> 00:32:59.519 align:start position:0%
that i included a committee seating
 
00:32:59.519 --> 00:33:00.549 align:start position:0%
that i included a committee seating
chart

00:33:00.549 --> 00:33:00.559 align:start position:0%
chart
 
00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:03.200 align:start position:0%
we have always uh done mixed seating
 
00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:03.669 align:start position:0%
we have always uh done mixed seating
where

00:33:03.669 --> 00:33:03.679 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
you know when we try to put every other
 
00:33:07.669 --> 00:33:07.679 align:start position:0%
person uh
 
00:33:11.350 --> 00:33:11.360 align:start position:0%
by party affiliation so that we can all
 
00:33:13.029 --> 00:33:13.039 align:start position:0%
get a chance to talk with each other and
 
00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:15.200 align:start position:0%
have good interactive dialogue
 
00:33:17.669 --> 00:33:17.679 align:start position:0%
so i have come up with a seating plan
 
00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:18.640 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:20.320 align:start position:0%
you know if if there's someone has a
 
00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
concern i would say
 
00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:23.360 align:start position:0%
please reach out to me and we'll do our
 
00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
okay typical bill topics
 
00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:33.440 align:start position:0%
so there is a section that we included
 
00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:35.120 align:start position:0%
here and i have to scroll down and find
 
00:33:38.149 --> 00:33:38.159 align:start position:0%
that myself
 
00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:41.440 align:start position:0%
often uh these are the the build topics
 
00:33:43.029 --> 00:33:43.039 align:start position:0%
that are regularly within our committee
 
00:33:44.710 --> 00:33:44.720 align:start position:0%
there certainly are some deviations at
 
00:33:45.909 --> 00:33:45.919 align:start position:0%
time but uh
 
00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:49.120 align:start position:0%
current use issues solid waste issues
 
00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:51.200 align:start position:0%
including recycling landfills
 
00:33:54.549 --> 00:33:54.559 align:start position:0%
product of stewardship agricultural
 
00:33:56.149 --> 00:33:56.159 align:start position:0%
support and promotion
 
00:33:59.669 --> 00:33:59.679 align:start position:0%
is the federal food safety modernization
 
00:34:01.269 --> 00:34:01.279 align:start position:0%
act we'll certainly have one this year
 
00:34:02.710 --> 00:34:02.720 align:start position:0%
on that because we need to extend it
 
00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:04.480 align:start position:0%
that's actually a bill that i had put in
 
00:34:07.909 --> 00:34:07.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:10.869 --> 00:34:10.879 align:start position:0%
issues dealing with farm stands issues
 
00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
dealing with pesticides those are
 
00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:14.720 align:start position:0%
certainly a regular
 
00:34:17.909 --> 00:34:17.919 align:start position:0%
regular topic that we discuss within the
 
00:34:17.919 --> 00:34:19.190 align:start position:0%
regular topic that we discuss within the
committee

00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:19.200 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:34:21.349 --> 00:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
and animal welfare both farm and
 
00:34:21.359 --> 00:34:22.950 align:start position:0%
and animal welfare both farm and
household

00:34:22.950 --> 00:34:22.960 align:start position:0%
household
 
00:34:26.149 --> 00:34:26.159 align:start position:0%
i would say the last three or four years
 
00:34:28.950 --> 00:34:28.960 align:start position:0%
that has dominated the majority of the
 
00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:30.240 align:start position:0%
of our time
 
00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:32.240 align:start position:0%
um in in the bills that have come before
 
00:34:34.389 --> 00:34:34.399 align:start position:0%
our committee has certainly spent
 
00:34:37.669 --> 00:34:37.679 align:start position:0%
on animal welfare bills i know we have
 
00:34:40.470 --> 00:34:40.480 align:start position:0%
less this year it looks to me like not
 
00:34:41.990 --> 00:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
all bills have been assigned yet but
 
00:34:43.990 --> 00:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
looking through the lsrs
 
00:34:45.990 --> 00:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
we definitely have less to do with that
 
00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
00:34:48.869 --> 00:34:48.879 align:start position:0%
those of us who've been here in the past
 
00:34:51.190 --> 00:34:51.200 align:start position:0%
will take a welcome deep breath on that
 
00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:52.950 align:start position:0%
will take a welcome deep breath on that
one

00:34:52.950 --> 00:34:52.960 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:34:55.349 --> 00:34:55.359 align:start position:0%
certainly has consumed a good amount of
 
00:34:59.109 --> 00:34:59.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:01.589 --> 00:35:01.599 align:start position:0%
okay early bill's going to second
 
00:35:01.599 --> 00:35:03.270 align:start position:0%
okay early bill's going to second
committee

00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:03.280 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:04.880 align:start position:0%
so there are sometimes there are bills
 
00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:06.560 align:start position:0%
that go to more than one committee
 
00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:09.680 align:start position:0%
and uh i haven't looked through i'm sure
 
00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
there are well i know there's some of
 
00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
ours that will because anything that has
 
00:35:13.510 --> 00:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
a fiscal note
 
00:35:16.870 --> 00:35:16.880 align:start position:0%
often goes over to finance or ways and
 
00:35:18.310 --> 00:35:18.320 align:start position:0%
means depending on
 
00:35:19.829 --> 00:35:19.839 align:start position:0%
what the bill is whether it's an income
 
00:35:22.470 --> 00:35:22.480 align:start position:0%
or an expense so those bills will get a
 
00:35:24.390 --> 00:35:24.400 align:start position:0%
priority and they will be heard first
 
00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
so that they can get through the process
 
00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:29.280 align:start position:0%
quicker and get to that second committee
 
00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
if you've uh in your orientation when
 
00:35:33.670 --> 00:35:33.680 align:start position:0%
you first became a rep i'm sure they
 
00:35:35.109 --> 00:35:35.119 align:start position:0%
talked about crossover
 
00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:36.720 align:start position:0%
and all of the deadlines that the house
 
00:35:39.109 --> 00:35:39.119 align:start position:0%
has and so we have to make sure we get
 
00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:40.400 align:start position:0%
all these bills through all of the
 
00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:42.160 align:start position:0%
committees prior to those deadlines that
 
00:35:42.790 --> 00:35:42.800 align:start position:0%
the house
 
00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
set and some of this um for those of you
 
00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
who are freshmen it may
 
00:35:50.310 --> 00:35:50.320 align:start position:0%
seem overwhelming at times there's uh
 
00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
there's there's a lot of things to
 
00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:53.030 align:start position:0%
there's there's a lot of things to
remember

00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
remember
 
00:35:54.790 --> 00:35:54.800 align:start position:0%
you don't have to remember them all
 
00:35:56.710 --> 00:35:56.720 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll all be there for you and by
 
00:35:57.349 --> 00:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
all means
 
00:35:59.990 --> 00:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
reach out and ask questions to myself to
 
00:36:01.829 --> 00:36:01.839 align:start position:0%
any member of the committee
 
00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:03.680 align:start position:0%
regardless of party we're all here to
 
00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:05.200 align:start position:0%
work together and we're all here to help
 
00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
you and uh
 
00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
you know we want to make sure that it's
 
00:36:09.589 --> 00:36:09.599 align:start position:0%
a good experience as well as a learning
 
00:36:09.599 --> 00:36:10.470 align:start position:0%
a good experience as well as a learning
experience

00:36:10.470 --> 00:36:10.480 align:start position:0%
experience
 
00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:12.640 align:start position:0%
myself included this uh this being my
 
00:36:14.390 --> 00:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
first term as a chair there's a lot i'm
 
00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:14.950 align:start position:0%
first term as a chair there's a lot i'm
learning

00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:14.960 align:start position:0%
learning
 
00:36:17.270 --> 00:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
and i certainly will be leaning on
 
00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
representative bixby as he's had
 
00:36:21.829 --> 00:36:21.839 align:start position:0%
past experience in leadership and we'll
 
00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
work through this together and we'll
 
00:36:24.950 --> 00:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
we'll get it done
 
00:36:26.630 --> 00:36:26.640 align:start position:0%
any questions on anything that i've
 
00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:33.430 --> 00:36:33.440 align:start position:0%
all right i don't see any hands and i
 
00:36:35.109 --> 00:36:35.119 align:start position:0%
don't hear anybody yelling so i'll
 
00:36:36.310 --> 00:36:36.320 align:start position:0%
continue on
 
00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:40.640 align:start position:0%
we'll go to sub committees so there are
 
00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:43.280 align:start position:0%
there are five subcommittees within our
 
00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:44.800 align:start position:0%
committee so sometimes we have bills
 
00:36:46.390 --> 00:36:46.400 align:start position:0%
that need more work than
 
00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:48.880 align:start position:0%
what the full committee can can do
 
00:36:50.950 --> 00:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
because it's just too time consuming
 
00:36:53.430 --> 00:36:53.440 align:start position:0%
and so we'll break out into smaller
 
00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:54.880 align:start position:0%
groups at times which are called
 
00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:55.910 align:start position:0%
groups at times which are called
subcommittees

00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
subcommittees
 
00:36:58.550 --> 00:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
and those uh subcommittees will do the
 
00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
legwork so to speak if we have a bill
 
00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:00.950 align:start position:0%
legwork so to speak if we have a bill
that

00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:00.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:37:03.750 --> 00:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
we we just need more information on and
 
00:37:04.390 --> 00:37:04.400 align:start position:0%
there are
 
00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:06.640 align:start position:0%
five different subcommittees and i
 
00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
included this in in your
 
00:37:10.390 --> 00:37:10.400 align:start position:0%
email handout there's environmental
 
00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:11.829 align:start position:0%
email handout there's environmental
policy

00:37:11.829 --> 00:37:11.839 align:start position:0%
policy
 
00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:15.680 align:start position:0%
agricultural policy current use
 
00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
animal protection and licensing and
 
00:37:19.990 --> 00:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
solid waste
 
00:37:21.510 --> 00:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
so those are the five subcommittees what
 
00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
i'd like you all to do is
 
00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
take a look at those subcommittees and
 
00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
i'd like you to pick
 
00:37:27.910 --> 00:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
two that you think you would have an
 
00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:29.680 align:start position:0%
interest in and send
 
00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:32.240 align:start position:0%
myself or judy or both of us an email
 
00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
and let us know
 
00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
that you're that's a committee a
 
00:37:35.829 --> 00:37:35.839 align:start position:0%
subcommittee you'd like to be placed
 
00:37:35.839 --> 00:37:37.030 align:start position:0%
subcommittee you'd like to be placed
upon

00:37:37.030 --> 00:37:37.040 align:start position:0%
upon
 
00:37:39.430 --> 00:37:39.440 align:start position:0%
now inevitably i've only got room for
 
00:37:40.950 --> 00:37:40.960 align:start position:0%
about six people on each committee so
 
00:37:43.030 --> 00:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
there may be some folks that
 
00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
you know you you'll pick too many on one
 
00:37:46.790 --> 00:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
committee and not enough on another but
 
00:37:48.310 --> 00:37:48.320 align:start position:0%
if you'll tell me the committees you're
 
00:37:50.470 --> 00:37:50.480 align:start position:0%
interested in i will try and get you
 
00:37:51.910 --> 00:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
the subcommittees i mean i will try and
 
00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
get you on those committees
 
00:37:56.470 --> 00:37:56.480 align:start position:0%
and if i may have to assign you to
 
00:37:57.510 --> 00:37:57.520 align:start position:0%
something a little different than what
 
00:37:59.430 --> 00:37:59.440 align:start position:0%
you asked for but i'll do my best to
 
00:38:02.069 --> 00:38:02.079 align:start position:0%
to get you where you want to be so if
 
00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
you could do that
 
00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:04.880 align:start position:0%
in the next few days would be very
 
00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
yeah so i just want to
 
00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:16.720 align:start position:0%
say that not always do these
 
00:38:19.270 --> 00:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
commit subcommittees meet they only meet
 
00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:19.910 align:start position:0%
commit subcommittees meet they only meet
when

00:38:19.910 --> 00:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
when
 
00:38:22.950 --> 00:38:22.960 align:start position:0%
we have a bill that uh needs some work
 
00:38:23.349 --> 00:38:23.359 align:start position:0%
on it
 
00:38:26.950 --> 00:38:26.960 align:start position:0%
so just because you are on uh you know
 
00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
current use
 
00:38:29.829 --> 00:38:29.839 align:start position:0%
subcommittee doesn't necessarily mean
 
00:38:29.839 --> 00:38:31.190 align:start position:0%
subcommittee doesn't necessarily mean
that

00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:31.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:32.480 align:start position:0%
you know you're going to have any
 
00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:36.160 align:start position:0%
additional huge workload
 
00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:38.640 align:start position:0%
that's a great point and uh again not
 
00:38:40.069 --> 00:38:40.079 align:start position:0%
all the bills have been assigned to our
 
00:38:40.079 --> 00:38:40.790 align:start position:0%
all the bills have been assigned to our
committee

00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:42.240 align:start position:0%
i looked this morning and i believe we
 
00:38:43.829 --> 00:38:43.839 align:start position:0%
were up to 18.
 
00:38:45.829 --> 00:38:45.839 align:start position:0%
i anticipate we'll probably have
 
00:38:48.550 --> 00:38:48.560 align:start position:0%
somewhere between 22 and 25 if
 
00:38:50.950 --> 00:38:50.960 align:start position:0%
things go but we'll have to wait and see
 
00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:52.480 align:start position:0%
once the final disposition to the
 
00:38:53.990 --> 00:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
committees is done
 
00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:56.240 align:start position:0%
yeah any any further committees oh go
 
00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:57.030 align:start position:0%
yeah any any further committees oh go
ahead

00:38:57.030 --> 00:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
ahead
 
00:38:59.829 --> 00:38:59.839 align:start position:0%
um so i actually took a look um and i i
 
00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:01.200 align:start position:0%
can send this out to everyone
 
00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:03.440 align:start position:0%
after this meeting but i made a
 
00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet of
 
00:39:06.470 --> 00:39:06.480 align:start position:0%
the bills that are definitely coming to
 
00:39:08.390 --> 00:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
our committee and prior to that i had
 
00:39:10.310 --> 00:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
gone through the lsrs
 
00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:13.200 align:start position:0%
and about half a dozen of the ones that
 
00:39:14.710 --> 00:39:14.720 align:start position:0%
i thought might be coming to us are
 
00:39:16.790 --> 00:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
actually going somewhere else
 
00:39:20.230 --> 00:39:20.240 align:start position:0%
and there are no bills that have been no
 
00:39:22.630 --> 00:39:22.640 align:start position:0%
lsrs that have been turned into bills
 
00:39:24.230 --> 00:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
that have not been assigned yet and
 
00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:26.240 align:start position:0%
there are only two
 
00:39:27.670 --> 00:39:27.680 align:start position:0%
left that have not been turned into
 
00:39:29.589 --> 00:39:29.599 align:start position:0%
bills that are likely to come to us
 
00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:32.800 align:start position:0%
so i can send that out and uh of course
 
00:39:34.230 --> 00:39:34.240 align:start position:0%
there might be a few that i
 
00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
missed on my pass through the lsrs or um
 
00:39:39.589 --> 00:39:39.599 align:start position:0%
someone might have a different idea
 
00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:40.960 align:start position:0%
about what should come to my
 
00:39:44.230 --> 00:39:44.240 align:start position:0%
our committee than i do but
 
00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:46.160 align:start position:0%
but i i think we're probably going to be
 
00:39:47.750 --> 00:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
close to about 20.
 
00:39:51.829 --> 00:39:51.839 align:start position:0%
yeah okay excellent representative aaron
 
00:39:54.950 --> 00:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
yeah um so i actually haven't had a
 
00:39:55.990 --> 00:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
chance to really look
 
00:39:59.030 --> 00:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
through the list so representative bixby
 
00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
are have you seen how many in that list
 
00:40:04.710 --> 00:40:04.720 align:start position:0%
maybe have already been through this
 
00:40:06.309 --> 00:40:06.319 align:start position:0%
committee last term
 
00:40:09.829 --> 00:40:09.839 align:start position:0%
and are returning because they were not
 
00:40:09.839 --> 00:40:10.309 align:start position:0%
and are returning because they were not
uh

00:40:10.309 --> 00:40:10.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:40:13.829 --> 00:40:13.839 align:start position:0%
passed in one way shape or form um
 
00:40:16.230 --> 00:40:16.240 align:start position:0%
about half of them are ones that are are
 
00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:17.440 align:start position:0%
repeats uh
 
00:40:20.950 --> 00:40:20.960 align:start position:0%
and i um i i can
 
00:40:23.430 --> 00:40:23.440 align:start position:0%
i can flag that on the document that i
 
00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
send out
 
00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:26.480 align:start position:0%
i hadn't put it onto the document yet
 
00:40:27.349 --> 00:40:27.359 align:start position:0%
but um
 
00:40:30.630 --> 00:40:30.640 align:start position:0%
and certainly your bill for des is one
 
00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
of them
 
00:40:33.589 --> 00:40:33.599 align:start position:0%
uh which and it was it was already good
 
00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:35.680 align:start position:0%
when we got it last year and it was
 
00:40:37.990 --> 00:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
perfect when we sent it out so i i'm
 
00:40:39.349 --> 00:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
anticipating that some of those are
 
00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:40.720 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
00:40:42.950 --> 00:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
uh pretty straightforward and efficient
 
00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:44.640 align:start position:0%
to work through again
 
00:40:46.550 --> 00:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
uh there might be some others that are
 
00:40:48.069 --> 00:40:48.079 align:start position:0%
require a little bit more
 
00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:51.200 align:start position:0%
um work given changes in circumstances
 
00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:53.440 align:start position:0%
and whatnot
 
00:40:55.750 --> 00:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
yeah i would uh add on to that that
 
00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:57.109 align:start position:0%
yeah i would uh add on to that that
there

00:40:57.109 --> 00:40:57.119 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:40:59.910 --> 00:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
for some of us you're going to see a lot
 
00:41:01.589 --> 00:41:01.599 align:start position:0%
of recycled language
 
00:41:04.069 --> 00:41:04.079 align:start position:0%
as we talked about it and i think those
 
00:41:06.150 --> 00:41:06.160 align:start position:0%
bills will go through fairly quickly and
 
00:41:07.510 --> 00:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
and the committee's done a lot of work
 
00:41:09.910 --> 00:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
on them already so i think we'll uh i
 
00:41:11.430 --> 00:41:11.440 align:start position:0%
think we'll do well with it
 
00:41:13.349 --> 00:41:13.359 align:start position:0%
i'm hopeful that we're going to have
 
00:41:13.359 --> 00:41:14.870 align:start position:0%
i'm hopeful that we're going to have
shorter

00:41:14.870 --> 00:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
shorter
 
00:41:17.829 --> 00:41:17.839 align:start position:0%
shorter hearing days than what we had in
 
00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
the last year because
 
00:41:23.270 --> 00:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:26.309 --> 00:41:26.319 align:start position:0%
any other questions on subcommittees and
 
00:41:30.150 --> 00:41:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:34.470 --> 00:41:34.480 align:start position:0%
all right so uh
 
00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:36.720 align:start position:0%
there's you'll see in the handout that i
 
00:41:37.990 --> 00:41:38.000 align:start position:0%
provided there's a lot of
 
00:41:40.069 --> 00:41:40.079 align:start position:0%
information about how subcommittees work
 
00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:41.680 align:start position:0%
they're they're very similar
 
00:41:44.230 --> 00:41:44.240 align:start position:0%
to the way the regular committee works
 
00:41:46.150 --> 00:41:46.160 align:start position:0%
as far as notification and
 
00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
things of that nature and uh i don't
 
00:41:51.109 --> 00:41:51.119 align:start position:0%
think i'm going to go over all of that i
 
00:41:51.990 --> 00:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
think you all can
 
00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:54.720 align:start position:0%
and can read it and you'll sort of get a
 
00:41:56.309 --> 00:41:56.319 align:start position:0%
real handle for it after we have our
 
00:41:56.319 --> 00:41:56.870 align:start position:0%
real handle for it after we have our
first

00:41:56.870 --> 00:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
first
 
00:41:58.870 --> 00:41:58.880 align:start position:0%
committee hearing that you'll see a lot
 
00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
of the will be
 
00:42:04.710 --> 00:42:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:07.750 --> 00:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
so calendar notice uh so that
 
00:42:09.829 --> 00:42:09.839 align:start position:0%
i will provide as much notice as i
 
00:42:11.109 --> 00:42:11.119 align:start position:0%
possibly can for
 
00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:12.560 align:start position:0%
for any of the things that are going on
 
00:42:15.349 --> 00:42:15.359 align:start position:0%
in our committee but there are times
 
00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
sometimes where you know something might
 
00:42:19.030 --> 00:42:19.040 align:start position:0%
slip by me you know it's in the calendar
 
00:42:19.829 --> 00:42:19.839 align:start position:0%
and i may not
 
00:42:21.510 --> 00:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
you may not get noticed personally from
 
00:42:23.829 --> 00:42:23.839 align:start position:0%
me on our on our committee email so
 
00:42:25.430 --> 00:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
i would always recommend that you keep
 
00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:27.200 align:start position:0%
an eye on the calendar every week when
 
00:42:28.069 --> 00:42:28.079 align:start position:0%
it comes out
 
00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
it's a really good idea and and as with
 
00:42:32.710 --> 00:42:32.720 align:start position:0%
any of this information i'm giving you
 
00:42:33.430 --> 00:42:33.440 align:start position:0%
today if you
 
00:42:35.910 --> 00:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
have any questions going on please reach
 
00:42:37.589 --> 00:42:37.599 align:start position:0%
out to myself or judy or
 
00:42:40.550 --> 00:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
or peter or you know and we'll
 
00:42:42.309 --> 00:42:42.319 align:start position:0%
collectively we'll find the answer if we
 
00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:48.390 --> 00:42:48.400 align:start position:0%
okay bill files i think i covered this
 
00:42:49.990 --> 00:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
earlier with the committee rooms and
 
00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:50.630 align:start position:0%
earlier with the committee rooms and
drawers

00:42:50.630 --> 00:42:50.640 align:start position:0%
drawers
 
00:42:53.910 --> 00:42:53.920 align:start position:0%
uh again that i'll reiterate you'll need
 
00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:54.309 align:start position:0%
uh again that i'll reiterate you'll need
to

00:42:54.309 --> 00:42:54.319 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:42:56.230 --> 00:42:56.240 align:start position:0%
bring everything with you when you come
 
00:42:58.150 --> 00:42:58.160 align:start position:0%
to uh the hearings and exec
 
00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
sessions that you'll need because uh at
 
00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
this point we can't store
 
00:43:05.109 --> 00:43:05.119 align:start position:0%
anything in the uh legislative office
 
00:43:05.119 --> 00:43:06.069 align:start position:0%
anything in the uh legislative office
building

00:43:06.069 --> 00:43:06.079 align:start position:0%
building
 
00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
so i'll break from my agenda just for a
 
00:43:09.829 --> 00:43:09.839 align:start position:0%
moment here
 
00:43:11.430 --> 00:43:11.440 align:start position:0%
i was gonna call it the lob there are
 
00:43:13.109 --> 00:43:13.119 align:start position:0%
many acronyms within
 
00:43:16.630 --> 00:43:16.640 align:start position:0%
the state government that we use
 
00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
ols the office of legislative services
 
00:43:21.990 --> 00:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
lob the legislative office building
 
00:43:23.990 --> 00:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
we tend to seize acronyms sometimes and
 
00:43:25.510 --> 00:43:25.520 align:start position:0%
for those of you that are new
 
00:43:26.710 --> 00:43:26.720 align:start position:0%
you're going to look at us and go what
 
00:43:28.790 --> 00:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
the heck are you talking about and i
 
00:43:31.030 --> 00:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
totally get that so
 
00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
don't hesitate to ask we just sort of
 
00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:34.960 align:start position:0%
use these shortcuts to get through
 
00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
things and you'll pick them up
 
00:43:38.550 --> 00:43:38.560 align:start position:0%
really quickly as you go along but by
 
00:43:39.670 --> 00:43:39.680 align:start position:0%
all means if
 
00:43:41.589 --> 00:43:41.599 align:start position:0%
if i say something that like that you
 
00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
know using an acronym
 
00:43:44.790 --> 00:43:44.800 align:start position:0%
and you don't know what it means feel
 
00:43:47.190 --> 00:43:47.200 align:start position:0%
free to just interrupt me and ask me for
 
00:43:48.870 --> 00:43:48.880 align:start position:0%
clarifications because i want to make
 
00:43:52.550 --> 00:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:56.230 --> 00:43:56.240 align:start position:0%
okay duties of committee members
 
00:43:58.150 --> 00:43:58.160 align:start position:0%
so uh the duties of the chair can be
 
00:44:00.790 --> 00:44:00.800 align:start position:0%
found in house rule 100.
 
00:44:02.630 --> 00:44:02.640 align:start position:0%
judy talked earlier about where to find
 
00:44:04.230 --> 00:44:04.240 align:start position:0%
the house rules and if you have trouble
 
00:44:05.430 --> 00:44:05.440 align:start position:0%
finding them
 
00:44:08.950 --> 00:44:08.960 align:start position:0%
by all means ask the vice chair
 
00:44:10.470 --> 00:44:10.480 align:start position:0%
works in conjunction with the chair and
 
00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
presides over the hearings in the
 
00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
meetings when the chair is absent or
 
00:44:15.030 --> 00:44:15.040 align:start position:0%
unable to preside
 
00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
so there'll be some bills that i have
 
00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
sponsored myself that are coming to our
 
00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:19.750 align:start position:0%
sponsored myself that are coming to our
committee

00:44:19.750 --> 00:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:44:22.790 --> 00:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
in in that case judy will step in and
 
00:44:24.069 --> 00:44:24.079 align:start position:0%
take the chair role
 
00:44:28.150 --> 00:44:28.160 align:start position:0%
during that hearing uh any bill that
 
00:44:31.430 --> 00:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
you have sponsored or co-sponsored if
 
00:44:34.390 --> 00:44:34.400 align:start position:0%
you speak on it you are not allowed to
 
00:44:35.109 --> 00:44:35.119 align:start position:0%
interview the
 
00:44:37.430 --> 00:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
the any of the further testimonials that
 
00:44:38.230 --> 00:44:38.240 align:start position:0%
come in from
 
00:44:41.349 --> 00:44:41.359 align:start position:0%
from other folks if you didn't speak on
 
00:44:42.790 --> 00:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
it i cleared this
 
00:44:45.109 --> 00:44:45.119 align:start position:0%
with the uh ran this scenario by the
 
00:44:46.630 --> 00:44:46.640 align:start position:0%
speaker because
 
00:44:48.630 --> 00:44:48.640 align:start position:0%
uh it's been different two different
 
00:44:49.910 --> 00:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
times that i've been there but the
 
00:44:51.589 --> 00:44:51.599 align:start position:0%
speaker's position is
 
00:44:54.230 --> 00:44:54.240 align:start position:0%
if you are a co-sponsor or a sponsor and
 
00:44:55.910 --> 00:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
you did not speak then you rema
 
00:44:58.309 --> 00:44:58.319 align:start position:0%
you may remain in your your seat and you
 
00:44:59.430 --> 00:44:59.440 align:start position:0%
may interview
 
00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
the other people witnesses who are
 
00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:02.790 align:start position:0%
the other people witnesses who are
testifying

00:45:02.790 --> 00:45:02.800 align:start position:0%
testifying
 
00:45:04.470 --> 00:45:04.480 align:start position:0%
or i guess witness isn't the right word
 
00:45:05.829 --> 00:45:05.839 align:start position:0%
any of the other folks that have come in
 
00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
to testify
 
00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
so that that is a little change from
 
00:45:10.870 --> 00:45:10.880 align:start position:0%
last year and again
 
00:45:13.349 --> 00:45:13.359 align:start position:0%
some of these nuances occur depending
 
00:45:14.790 --> 00:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
upon the speaker's position
 
00:45:17.430 --> 00:45:17.440 align:start position:0%
so it will be our position this year
 
00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:17.990 align:start position:0%
so it will be our position this year
that

00:45:17.990 --> 00:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:45:20.550 --> 00:45:20.560 align:start position:0%
if you have spoken and testified on a
 
00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:21.030 align:start position:0%
if you have spoken and testified on a
bill

00:45:21.030 --> 00:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:45:23.349 --> 00:45:23.359 align:start position:0%
you may not interview and ask questions
 
00:45:25.510 --> 00:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
of any other folks that are testifying
 
00:45:27.430 --> 00:45:27.440 align:start position:0%
but if you have not testified then you
 
00:45:29.270 --> 00:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
will be able to
 
00:45:30.630 --> 00:45:30.640 align:start position:0%
is that clear does everybody understand
 
00:45:32.790 --> 00:45:32.800 align:start position:0%
where i'm going with that
 
00:45:35.109 --> 00:45:35.119 align:start position:0%
all right uh representative aaron yeah
 
00:45:37.349 --> 00:45:37.359 align:start position:0%
so yes i'm clear on that
 
00:45:40.069 --> 00:45:40.079 align:start position:0%
so but what that means is if you are the
 
00:45:40.079 --> 00:45:40.950 align:start position:0%
so but what that means is if you are the
sponsor

00:45:40.950 --> 00:45:40.960 align:start position:0%
sponsor
 
00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
and you present the bill then you cannot
 
00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:44.069 align:start position:0%
and you present the bill then you cannot
ask

00:45:44.069 --> 00:45:44.079 align:start position:0%
ask
 
00:45:47.910 --> 00:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
questions of any of the um
 
00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:51.280 align:start position:0%
uh you know people who are testifying on
 
00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:51.910 align:start position:0%
uh you know people who are testifying on
it

00:45:51.910 --> 00:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:45:53.670 --> 00:45:53.680 align:start position:0%
because you've already presented the
 
00:45:55.910 --> 00:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
bill and spoken on it
 
00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
is that correct okay that is correct now
 
00:46:02.870 --> 00:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
if for those of you who are new if you
 
00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:03.109 align:start position:0%
if for those of you who are new if you
are

00:46:03.109 --> 00:46:03.119 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:46:04.790 --> 00:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor on a bill and you're
 
00:46:06.550 --> 00:46:06.560 align:start position:0%
not able to do it you can ask one of
 
00:46:09.030 --> 00:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
your co-sponsors to introduce the bill
 
00:46:11.270 --> 00:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
so just uh those are some of the little
 
00:46:13.990 --> 00:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
nuances that occur
 
00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
any further questions on that area
 
00:46:17.829 --> 00:46:17.839 align:start position:0%
before i move on
 
00:46:20.710 --> 00:46:20.720 align:start position:0%
yeah i had a like a pragmatic question
 
00:46:22.230 --> 00:46:22.240 align:start position:0%
on that
 
00:46:24.790 --> 00:46:24.800 align:start position:0%
um okay yep if you were meeting in
 
00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:25.270 align:start position:0%
um okay yep if you were meeting in
person

00:46:25.270 --> 00:46:25.280 align:start position:0%
person
 
00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:28.720 align:start position:0%
generally um the member would like sit
 
00:46:31.750 --> 00:46:31.760 align:start position:0%
where the the public sits to just to
 
00:46:32.950 --> 00:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
show some physical distance in the past
 
00:46:37.430 --> 00:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
what how do we
 
00:46:39.829 --> 00:46:39.839 align:start position:0%
separate that and make folks aware who
 
00:46:41.910 --> 00:46:41.920 align:start position:0%
might be participating by zoom if you
 
00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:42.230 align:start position:0%
might be participating by zoom if you
are

00:46:42.230 --> 00:46:42.240 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:46:45.270 --> 00:46:45.280 align:start position:0%
telephonically meeting and sitting this
 
00:46:48.069 --> 00:46:48.079 align:start position:0%
one out so to speak
 
00:46:49.589 --> 00:46:49.599 align:start position:0%
i'm going to actually have to get a
 
00:46:51.349 --> 00:46:51.359 align:start position:0%
little further guidance on that before i
 
00:46:52.309 --> 00:46:52.319 align:start position:0%
answer because
 
00:46:54.150 --> 00:46:54.160 align:start position:0%
i don't know the answer to that it's
 
00:46:55.510 --> 00:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
going to be a little bit challenging to
 
00:46:55.990 --> 00:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
do that
 
00:46:58.390 --> 00:46:58.400 align:start position:0%
and that's part of the reason that i
 
00:46:59.910 --> 00:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
really like in-person meeting if
 
00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
possible but
 
00:47:02.309 --> 00:47:02.319 align:start position:0%
let me i'm going to make note of that
 
00:47:04.150 --> 00:47:04.160 align:start position:0%
question and i'm going to i'm going to
 
00:47:05.589 --> 00:47:05.599 align:start position:0%
get an answer before i
 
00:47:07.270 --> 00:47:07.280 align:start position:0%
just stumble my way through it is that
 
00:47:16.230 --> 00:47:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:17.829 --> 00:47:17.839 align:start position:0%
could you repeat that question i didn't
 
00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
quite hear it sounded like she was
 
00:47:21.190 --> 00:47:21.200 align:start position:0%
asking how do you ask questions of
 
00:47:22.549 --> 00:47:22.559 align:start position:0%
people who are testifying if you're
 
00:47:23.589 --> 00:47:23.599 align:start position:0%
remote is that
 
00:47:26.069 --> 00:47:26.079 align:start position:0%
was that the question no that wasn't the
 
00:47:26.079 --> 00:47:26.630 align:start position:0%
was that the question no that wasn't the
question

00:47:26.630 --> 00:47:26.640 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:47:29.670 --> 00:47:29.680 align:start position:0%
so generally when we would be when we've
 
00:47:30.710 --> 00:47:30.720 align:start position:0%
met in person
 
00:47:33.430 --> 00:47:33.440 align:start position:0%
and you are a sponsor or a co-sponsor
 
00:47:35.030 --> 00:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
and are speaking on your bill you would
 
00:47:36.549 --> 00:47:36.559 align:start position:0%
physically remove yourself from the
 
00:47:38.710 --> 00:47:38.720 align:start position:0%
committee chair location
 
00:47:42.470 --> 00:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
and sit where the public members sit
 
00:47:45.750 --> 00:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
um during that time so i'm just wanting
 
00:47:47.190 --> 00:47:47.200 align:start position:0%
to make sure that's clear to the folks
 
00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:48.470 align:start position:0%
to make sure that's clear to the folks
participating

00:47:48.470 --> 00:47:48.480 align:start position:0%
participating
 
00:47:52.549 --> 00:47:52.559 align:start position:0%
uh remotely that you're sort of
 
00:47:55.589 --> 00:47:55.599 align:start position:0%
not participating in the same manner
 
00:47:58.790 --> 00:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
right no it i'm not sure how we would
 
00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
distinguish that on zoom because i think
 
00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
it would be too much of a challenge to
 
00:48:06.069 --> 00:48:06.079 align:start position:0%
take you out of being a panelist and put
 
00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
you back in
 
00:48:08.069 --> 00:48:08.079 align:start position:0%
you know i think that would be a
 
00:48:09.829 --> 00:48:09.839 align:start position:0%
challenge so let me see i'll ask that
 
00:48:11.190 --> 00:48:11.200 align:start position:0%
question and let me see if i can get a
 
00:48:13.589 --> 00:48:13.599 align:start position:0%
little further clarification
 
00:48:17.190 --> 00:48:17.200 align:start position:0%
mr chair yes maybe
 
00:48:20.069 --> 00:48:20.079 align:start position:0%
if you are the sponsor and you are
 
00:48:21.589 --> 00:48:21.599 align:start position:0%
speaking to the bill then maybe you just
 
00:48:21.599 --> 00:48:22.069 align:start position:0%
speaking to the bill then maybe you just
remain

00:48:22.069 --> 00:48:22.079 align:start position:0%
remain
 
00:48:25.510 --> 00:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
mute um for the entire
 
00:48:28.950 --> 00:48:28.960 align:start position:0%
that hearing keep your mute button on
 
00:48:31.109 --> 00:48:31.119 align:start position:0%
might be the way to go that would
 
00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:32.720 align:start position:0%
probably be a
 
00:48:34.710 --> 00:48:34.720 align:start position:0%
a wise idea that way you wouldn't slip
 
00:48:36.710 --> 00:48:36.720 align:start position:0%
up and ask a question
 
00:48:38.950 --> 00:48:38.960 align:start position:0%
and i'll try to keep on top of it as
 
00:48:41.589 --> 00:48:41.599 align:start position:0%
well as as far as who's testified and
 
00:48:45.190 --> 00:48:45.200 align:start position:0%
who's asking any other questions before
 
00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:45.670 align:start position:0%
who's asking any other questions before
we

00:48:45.670 --> 00:48:45.680 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:48:48.950 --> 00:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
move forward
 
00:48:51.030 --> 00:48:51.040 align:start position:0%
all right we've got about seven more
 
00:48:53.510 --> 00:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
minutes before our
 
00:48:56.710 --> 00:48:56.720 align:start position:0%
presentation and i think if i probably
 
00:48:58.390 --> 00:48:58.400 align:start position:0%
move along quickly we can get through
 
00:49:01.510 --> 00:49:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:05.270 --> 00:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
as we go okay so duties of committee
 
00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:06.630 align:start position:0%
as we go okay so duties of committee
members

00:49:06.630 --> 00:49:06.640 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:49:08.710 --> 00:49:08.720 align:start position:0%
now again your duties uh let's see
 
00:49:10.150 --> 00:49:10.160 align:start position:0%
that's the chair
 
00:49:12.150 --> 00:49:12.160 align:start position:0%
i gotta oh sorry i got myself in the
 
00:49:15.109 --> 00:49:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:17.109 --> 00:49:17.119 align:start position:0%
is there any further questions on uh the
 
00:49:18.470 --> 00:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
duties of the committee members
 
00:49:20.150 --> 00:49:20.160 align:start position:0%

howard i just
 
00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to make a brief comment in terms
 
00:51:20.230 --> 00:51:20.240 align:start position:0%
of the um
 
00:51:21.829 --> 00:51:21.839 align:start position:0%
the researcher the the committee
 
00:51:24.630 --> 00:51:24.640 align:start position:0%
researcher essentially
 
00:51:28.390 --> 00:51:28.400 align:start position:0%
does um gathers information
 
00:51:29.829 --> 00:51:29.839 align:start position:0%
that the committee knows that it's going
 
00:51:31.589 --> 00:51:31.599 align:start position:0%
to be needing uh
 
00:51:34.630 --> 00:51:34.640 align:start position:0%
for uh bills that we're working on
 
00:51:37.829 --> 00:51:37.839 align:start position:0%
and uh it is
 
00:51:41.270 --> 00:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
it's essentially the the um the purview
 
00:51:43.670 --> 00:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
of the chair or the vice chair to do the
 
00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:44.470 align:start position:0%
of the chair or the vice chair to do the
contacts

00:51:47.589 --> 00:51:47.599 align:start position:0%
with the committee researcher um
 
00:51:51.910 --> 00:51:51.920 align:start position:0%
and uh if members want to have research
 
00:51:53.910 --> 00:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
done on a particular issue or with a
 
00:51:55.430 --> 00:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
particular set of questions
 
00:51:58.470 --> 00:51:58.480 align:start position:0%

and then i'll leave it be it's
 
00:52:32.950 --> 00:52:32.960 align:start position:0%
it's an experience um and we do such a
 
00:52:34.870 --> 00:52:34.880 align:start position:0%
good job together and being there and
 
00:52:36.069 --> 00:52:36.079 align:start position:0%
discussing and
 
00:52:37.990 --> 00:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
and you know and taking in the
 
00:52:39.829 --> 00:52:39.839 align:start position:0%
information especially on the executive
 
00:52:39.839 --> 00:52:40.309 align:start position:0%
information especially on the executive
sessions

00:52:40.309 --> 00:52:40.319 align:start position:0%
sessions
 
00:52:42.309 --> 00:52:42.319 align:start position:0%
that this committee has always worked
 
00:52:43.829 --> 00:52:43.839 align:start position:0%
wonderfully together
 
00:52:47.270 --> 00:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
and uh i feel some of that's not going
 
00:52:49.430 --> 00:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
to be the same with us on zoom so if
 
00:52:51.030 --> 00:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
you're able to come please do
 
00:52:54.069 --> 00:52:54.079 align:start position:0%
and if you have health concerns then i
 
00:52:56.069 --> 00:52:56.079 align:start position:0%
accept that and i understand it and
 
00:52:57.349 --> 00:52:57.359 align:start position:0%
we'll do our best to
 
00:52:59.829 --> 00:52:59.839 align:start position:0%

in the
 
00:53:02.630 --> 00:53:02.640 align:start position:0%
in the virtual room like the regular
 
00:53:03.910 --> 00:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
room as much as we can
 
00:53:05.829 --> 00:53:05.839 align:start position:0%
so just the biggest thing is
 
00:53:05.839 --> 00:53:07.430 align:start position:0%
so just the biggest thing is
communication

00:53:07.430 --> 00:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
communication
 
00:53:08.950 --> 00:53:08.960 align:start position:0%

00:53:11.270 --> 00:53:11.280 align:start position:0%

can uh there's nothing we can't solve if
 
00:53:25.589 --> 00:53:25.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:28.710 --> 00:53:28.720 align:start position:0%

technology person and she'll be watching
that

00:54:08.710 --> 00:54:08.720 align:start position:0%

as we get into the hearing process and
 
00:54:17.510 --> 00:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
but you we always start every question
 
00:54:18.710 --> 00:54:18.720 align:start position:0%
off with
 
00:54:21.190 --> 00:54:21.200 align:start position:0%
with uh mr chair may i ask a question

i'll always give you permission to do so
 
00:54:25.349 --> 00:54:25.359 align:start position:0%
as long as there's some reason that i
 
00:54:26.150 --> 00:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
can't and
 
00:54:28.870 --> 00:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
and then you'll address the person you
 
00:54:30.230 --> 00:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
know thank you for coming
 
00:54:32.549 --> 00:54:32.559 align:start position:0%
uh i appreciate you taking my question
 
00:54:34.230 --> 00:54:34.240 align:start position:0%
and and then ask your question
 
00:54:35.990 --> 00:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
but you need to remember that we're
 
00:54:37.510 --> 00:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
we're not arguing with the with the
 
00:54:39.990 --> 00:54:40.000 align:start position:0%
people that are coming in to testify
 
00:54:42.630 --> 00:54:42.640 align:start position:0%
we're getting information from them you
 
00:54:44.390 --> 00:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
know making speeches
 
00:54:47.589 --> 00:54:47.599 align:start position:0%
you you're going to absolutely adamantly
 
00:54:49.109 --> 00:54:49.119 align:start position:0%
disagree with some of the people that
 
00:54:50.630 --> 00:54:50.640 align:start position:0%
are going to come in and present
 
00:54:52.789 --> 00:54:52.799 align:start position:0%
information to you you're going to
 
00:54:55.030 --> 00:54:55.040 align:start position:0%
just completely disagree with everything
 
00:54:55.910 --> 00:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
they're saying
 
00:54:57.270 --> 00:54:57.280 align:start position:0%
but you still smile and you keep it
 
00:55:00.069 --> 00:55:00.079 align:start position:0%
professional and you you ask a question
 
00:55:01.829 --> 00:55:01.839 align:start position:0%
of some anything you'd like a further
 
00:55:03.109 --> 00:55:03.119 align:start position:0%
point on but
 
00:55:05.270 --> 00:55:05.280 align:start position:0%
and if you have a second question a
 
00:55:07.030 --> 00:55:07.040 align:start position:0%
follow-up you always ask the chair for
 
00:55:09.750 --> 00:55:09.760 align:start position:0%
permission to ask a follow-up
 
00:55:13.510 --> 00:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:16.630 --> 00:55:16.640 align:start position:0%
okay i just
 
00:55:20.470 --> 00:55:20.480 align:start position:0%
just want to sort of stress that um
 
00:55:22.230 --> 00:55:22.240 align:start position:0%
that level of respect that we give to
 
00:55:24.150 --> 00:55:24.160 align:start position:0%
the people who are testifying
 
00:55:27.190 --> 00:55:27.200 align:start position:0%
uh it is are really critical
 
00:55:31.109 --> 00:55:31.119 align:start position:0%
that um we maintain
 
00:55:33.990 --> 00:55:34.000 align:start position:0%
uh respect for everyone who comes in to
 
00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:34.710 align:start position:0%
uh respect for everyone who comes in to
testify

00:55:34.710 --> 00:55:34.720 align:start position:0%
testify
 
00:55:36.789 --> 00:55:36.799 align:start position:0%
whether they're we agree that we agree
 
00:55:38.069 --> 00:55:38.079 align:start position:0%
with him or not
 
00:55:41.109 --> 00:55:41.119 align:start position:0%
and uh we do not
 
00:55:44.230 --> 00:55:44.240 align:start position:0%
cross-examine we uh
 
00:55:45.910 --> 00:55:45.920 align:start position:0%
we can ask questions we can ask
 
00:55:48.390 --> 00:55:48.400 align:start position:0%
follow-ups for clarification
 
00:55:50.710 --> 00:55:50.720 align:start position:0%
but if you think that someone who's
 
00:55:53.349 --> 00:55:53.359 align:start position:0%
testifying is just simply wrong
 
00:55:54.950 --> 00:55:54.960 align:start position:0%
that's something that you can bring up
 
00:55:56.549 --> 00:55:56.559 align:start position:0%
later when we're discussing things as a
 
00:55:57.910 --> 00:55:57.920 align:start position:0%
committee don't
 
00:56:00.950 --> 00:56:00.960 align:start position:0%
don't attack never never never
 
00:56:05.670 --> 00:56:05.680 align:start position:0%
attack a witness absolutely
 
00:56:09.109 --> 00:56:09.119 align:start position:0%
thank you peter bob and tara we it is
 
00:56:09.990 --> 00:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
two o'clock
 
00:56:12.630 --> 00:56:12.640 align:start position:0%
i've probably got five to seven more
 
00:56:14.390 --> 00:56:14.400 align:start position:0%
minutes would it be okay with you if i
 
00:56:15.589 --> 00:56:15.599 align:start position:0%
finished through this part before we
 
00:56:17.030 --> 00:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
went on to your presentation
 
00:56:20.309 --> 00:56:20.319 align:start position:0%
it's fine with me okay
 
00:56:22.710 --> 00:56:22.720 align:start position:0%
yeah me too all right thank you i
 
00:56:23.750 --> 00:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate that
 
00:56:25.270 --> 00:56:25.280 align:start position:0%
i know i had your schedule in for two
 
00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:29.349 align:start position:0%
i know i had your schedule in for two
o'clock

00:56:29.349 --> 00:56:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:32.309 --> 00:56:32.319 align:start position:0%
okay so you'll see there's a few more
 
00:56:33.750 --> 00:56:33.760 align:start position:0%
ground rules that i
 
00:56:37.750 --> 00:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
included um in
 
00:56:40.549 --> 00:56:40.559 align:start position:0%
you know the way that you you we handle
 
00:56:42.870 --> 00:56:42.880 align:start position:0%
our hearings i'll let you review those i
 
00:56:43.670 --> 00:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
don't think this
 
00:56:45.510 --> 00:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
i think we've hit the high points on
 
00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:46.789 align:start position:0%
i think we've hit the high points on
them

00:56:46.789 --> 00:56:46.799 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:56:49.750 --> 00:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
um we've talked about committee members
 
00:56:51.750 --> 00:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
being sponsors and co-sponsors let's
 
00:56:54.549 --> 00:56:54.559 align:start position:0%
skip over to executive session
 
00:56:56.390 --> 00:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
so this is the time where a quorum comes
 
00:56:59.430 --> 00:56:59.440 align:start position:0%
into play that uh
 
00:57:01.349 --> 00:57:01.359 align:start position:0%
and that we have to know we're gonna go
 
00:57:03.510 --> 00:57:03.520 align:start position:0%
through basically a process similar to
 
00:57:05.109 --> 00:57:05.119 align:start position:0%
what we did at the start of this meeting
 
00:57:08.390 --> 00:57:08.400 align:start position:0%
to identify who you are if you're
 
00:57:10.789 --> 00:57:10.799 align:start position:0%
signing on virtually i'm gonna ask at
 
00:57:13.030 --> 00:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
those times i at least need to see a
 
00:57:14.630 --> 00:57:14.640 align:start position:0%
picture of you in the beginning you have
 
00:57:16.390 --> 00:57:16.400 align:start position:0%
your camera on so that i can confirm
 
00:57:17.349 --> 00:57:17.359 align:start position:0%
it's you
 
00:57:19.910 --> 00:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
that and you're the one that is voting
 
00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:20.549 align:start position:0%
that and you're the one that is voting
because

00:57:20.549 --> 00:57:20.559 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:57:21.910 --> 00:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
when we're doing votes it's real
 
00:57:23.670 --> 00:57:23.680 align:start position:0%
important that we know it's only
 
00:57:24.870 --> 00:57:24.880 align:start position:0%
committee members and
 
00:57:26.549 --> 00:57:26.559 align:start position:0%
and that's doing the voting and not
 
00:57:28.230 --> 00:57:28.240 align:start position:0%
someone else for you
 
00:57:30.470 --> 00:57:30.480 align:start position:0%
so i i would like to have that visual
 
00:57:32.069 --> 00:57:32.079 align:start position:0%
confirmation if possible
 
00:57:34.710 --> 00:57:34.720 align:start position:0%
i realized sometimes there are areas in
 
00:57:36.069 --> 00:57:36.079 align:start position:0%
the state that you may be
 
00:57:38.309 --> 00:57:38.319 align:start position:0%
calling from that the technology just
 
00:57:39.910 --> 00:57:39.920 align:start position:0%
won't support it we'll have to work
 
00:57:40.630 --> 00:57:40.640 align:start position:0%
around that
 
00:57:43.190 --> 00:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
if uh if you find yourself in that
 
00:57:43.200 --> 00:57:45.190 align:start position:0%
if uh if you find yourself in that
situation

00:57:45.190 --> 00:57:45.200 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:57:48.470 --> 00:57:48.480 align:start position:0%
any questions on that part of it okay as
 
00:57:50.549 --> 00:57:50.559 align:start position:0%
we go through executive sessions there's
 
00:57:53.270 --> 00:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
certain motions that can be made most of
 
00:57:55.589 --> 00:57:55.599 align:start position:0%
the time this is going to be sorted out
 
00:57:58.309 --> 00:57:58.319 align:start position:0%
between the ranking member and myself as
 
00:57:59.910 --> 00:57:59.920 align:start position:0%
far as who's going to be making the
 
00:57:59.920 --> 00:58:00.710 align:start position:0%
far as who's going to be making the
motions

00:58:00.710 --> 00:58:00.720 align:start position:0%
motions
 
00:58:05.030 --> 00:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
and with that comes the responsibility
 
00:58:05.040 --> 00:58:05.349 align:start position:0%
and with that comes the responsibility
of

00:58:05.349 --> 00:58:05.359 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:58:08.069 --> 00:58:08.079 align:start position:0%
you'll be called upon for so if we've
 
00:58:09.430 --> 00:58:09.440 align:start position:0%
got a bill coming forward i
 
00:58:11.750 --> 00:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
i may when i open up the exact session
 
00:58:13.109 --> 00:58:13.119 align:start position:0%
and i'll go okay i'm looking for a
 
00:58:14.470 --> 00:58:14.480 align:start position:0%
motion and i believe rep
 
00:58:16.230 --> 00:58:16.240 align:start position:0%
i recognize representative bixby to make
 
00:58:17.910 --> 00:58:17.920 align:start position:0%
a motion and
 
00:58:20.789 --> 00:58:20.799 align:start position:0%
he'll make his motion and whatever it is
 
00:58:21.270 --> 00:58:21.280 align:start position:0%
and he'll
 
00:58:23.670 --> 00:58:23.680 align:start position:0%
then i'll recognize him to speak to it
 
00:58:24.870 --> 00:58:24.880 align:start position:0%
when uh we'll have a second
 
00:58:26.950 --> 00:58:26.960 align:start position:0%
then i'll recognize him to speak to it
 
00:58:28.390 --> 00:58:28.400 align:start position:0%
and from there
 
00:58:30.230 --> 00:58:30.240 align:start position:0%
it will then open up to the rest of the
 
00:58:32.470 --> 00:58:32.480 align:start position:0%
committee to come up with any
 
00:58:35.109 --> 00:58:35.119 align:start position:0%
points pros or cons again that same
 
00:58:36.870 --> 00:58:36.880 align:start position:0%
level of respect
 
00:58:40.069 --> 00:58:40.079 align:start position:0%
goes to the committee members as it does
 
00:58:42.230 --> 00:58:42.240 align:start position:0%
to the people testifying
 
00:58:43.910 --> 00:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
you you may completely disagree with the
 
00:58:45.589 --> 00:58:45.599 align:start position:0%
position that i have and i'm okay with
 
00:58:45.599 --> 00:58:46.309 align:start position:0%
position that i have and i'm okay with
that

00:58:46.309 --> 00:58:46.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:58:47.750 --> 00:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
you know if we get into one of those
 
00:58:49.349 --> 00:58:49.359 align:start position:0%
bills where there's
 
00:58:51.670 --> 00:58:51.680 align:start position:0%
some you know conflicting opinions but
 
00:58:53.750 --> 00:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
we we typically
 
00:58:55.510 --> 00:58:55.520 align:start position:0%
speak to and address each other as you
 
00:58:56.950 --> 00:58:56.960 align:start position:0%
know representative contour
 
00:58:58.549 --> 00:58:58.559 align:start position:0%
representative bixby representative
 
00:58:58.559 --> 00:58:59.510 align:start position:0%
representative bixby representative
kennedy

00:58:59.510 --> 00:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
kennedy
 
00:59:01.190 --> 00:59:01.200 align:start position:0%
whatever it is whomever you're speaking
 
00:59:03.109 --> 00:59:03.119 align:start position:0%
to those are the people
 
00:59:04.710 --> 00:59:04.720 align:start position:0%
that's just the respect that we give
 
00:59:07.109 --> 00:59:07.119 align:start position:0%
each other and it because the public can
 
00:59:07.119 --> 00:59:07.510 align:start position:0%
each other and it because the public can
view

00:59:07.510 --> 00:59:07.520 align:start position:0%
view
 
00:59:10.150 --> 00:59:10.160 align:start position:0%
these executive sessions they cannot
 
00:59:10.160 --> 00:59:11.270 align:start position:0%
these executive sessions they cannot
participate

00:59:11.270 --> 00:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
participate
 
00:59:13.270 --> 00:59:13.280 align:start position:0%
but it's important to demonstrate to
 
00:59:14.630 --> 00:59:14.640 align:start position:0%
them that we have the respect
 
00:59:16.309 --> 00:59:16.319 align:start position:0%
between each other as much as we do for
 
00:59:17.990 --> 00:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
them and we see
 
00:59:21.349 --> 00:59:21.359 align:start position:0%
enough disrespectful behavior
 
00:59:23.270 --> 00:59:23.280 align:start position:0%
all around the country and we don't need
 
00:59:24.230 --> 00:59:24.240 align:start position:0%
that here in new hampshire and
 
00:59:25.750 --> 00:59:25.760 align:start position:0%
especially not within our committee
 
00:59:27.670 --> 00:59:27.680 align:start position:0%
and i want to make sure that we treat
 
00:59:29.190 --> 00:59:29.200 align:start position:0%
each other appropriately and
 
00:59:30.150 --> 00:59:30.160 align:start position:0%
respectfully so
 
00:59:31.910 --> 00:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
that's kind of a big big point that i
 
00:59:35.190 --> 00:59:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:37.510 --> 00:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
so there there are motions that can be
 
00:59:39.270 --> 00:59:39.280 align:start position:0%
made and those again that information is
 
00:59:40.069 --> 00:59:40.079 align:start position:0%
all listed
 
00:59:43.109 --> 00:59:43.119 align:start position:0%
within the uh the handouts that i gave
 
00:59:43.119 --> 00:59:44.150 align:start position:0%
within the uh the handouts that i gave
you

00:59:44.150 --> 00:59:44.160 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:59:47.270 --> 00:59:47.280 align:start position:0%
uh if i think you'll
 
00:59:48.710 --> 00:59:48.720 align:start position:0%
you'll find as we go through these
 
00:59:50.150 --> 00:59:50.160 align:start position:0%
executive sessions that they'll flow
 
00:59:51.510 --> 00:59:51.520 align:start position:0%
pretty smoothly
 
00:59:53.430 --> 00:59:53.440 align:start position:0%
it it'll be intriguing the first time
 
00:59:54.870 --> 00:59:54.880 align:start position:0%
that you go through it as a freshman you
 
00:59:54.880 --> 00:59:55.109 align:start position:0%
that you go through it as a freshman you
know

00:59:55.109 --> 00:59:55.119 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:59:57.750 --> 00:59:57.760 align:start position:0%
you'll you'll watch and see how it rolls
 
00:59:57.760 --> 00:59:58.470 align:start position:0%
you'll you'll watch and see how it rolls
but

00:59:58.470 --> 00:59:58.480 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:00:00.150 --> 01:00:00.160 align:start position:0%
there's a there's an order that the role
 
01:00:02.309 --> 01:00:02.319 align:start position:0%
will be called and but you you'll
 
01:00:04.549 --> 01:00:04.559 align:start position:0%
you'll have caucuses on on both sides on
 
01:00:06.069 --> 01:00:06.079 align:start position:0%
the democrat on the republican side
 
01:00:07.430 --> 01:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
we'll have caucuses
 
01:00:09.270 --> 01:00:09.280 align:start position:0%
you'll typically understand where we all
 
01:00:10.470 --> 01:00:10.480 align:start position:0%
are when we
 
01:00:14.069 --> 01:00:14.079 align:start position:0%
uh when we meet
 
01:00:17.109 --> 01:00:17.119 align:start position:0%
right so when it comes to voting the
 
01:00:19.910 --> 01:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
uh i'll call once we're ready i'll ask
 
01:00:21.190 --> 01:00:21.200 align:start position:0%
if you're ready to vote if there's no
 
01:00:23.030 --> 01:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
further discussion and then i will
 
01:00:24.630 --> 01:00:24.640 align:start position:0%
send it to the clerk just as i did at
 
01:00:26.870 --> 01:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
the beginning of this meeting to
 
01:00:28.710 --> 01:00:28.720 align:start position:0%
call the role and you'll be asked to
 
01:00:30.150 --> 01:00:30.160 align:start position:0%
give your vote either
 
01:00:33.589 --> 01:00:33.599 align:start position:0%
yay or nay yes or no and we'll go from
 
01:00:33.599 --> 01:00:34.710 align:start position:0%
yay or nay yes or no and we'll go from
there

01:00:34.710 --> 01:00:34.720 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:00:37.990 --> 01:00:38.000 align:start position:0%
there's information on conflicts of
 
01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:39.270 align:start position:0%
there's information on conflicts of
interest

01:00:39.270 --> 01:00:39.280 align:start position:0%
interest
 
01:00:41.510 --> 01:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
that you will want to review because
 
01:00:43.510 --> 01:00:43.520 align:start position:0%
sometimes there are bills
 
01:00:46.710 --> 01:00:46.720 align:start position:0%
where your outside affiliations um from
 
01:00:48.069 --> 01:00:48.079 align:start position:0%
your daily life you know we're all
 
01:00:49.349 --> 01:00:49.359 align:start position:0%
citizens legislators
 
01:00:51.270 --> 01:00:51.280 align:start position:0%
we all have jobs or lives outside of
 
01:00:53.190 --> 01:00:53.200 align:start position:0%
this occasionally there are bills that
 
01:00:54.870 --> 01:00:54.880 align:start position:0%
come in that
 
01:00:56.309 --> 01:00:56.319 align:start position:0%
you'll have a conflict of interest and
 
01:00:58.309 --> 01:00:58.319 align:start position:0%
if you have filed one with the clerk
 
01:00:58.319 --> 01:00:58.789 align:start position:0%
if you have filed one with the clerk
then

01:00:58.789 --> 01:00:58.799 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:01:01.510 --> 01:01:01.520 align:start position:0%
you will not be required to vote
 
01:01:03.190 --> 01:01:03.200 align:start position:0%
otherwise if you are in the room you
 
01:01:06.870 --> 01:01:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:11.270 --> 01:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
peter did i miss anything there
 
01:01:13.349 --> 01:01:13.359 align:start position:0%
i think that i think that covers it
 
01:01:14.710 --> 01:01:14.720 align:start position:0%
pretty well um
 
01:01:17.430 --> 01:01:17.440 align:start position:0%
and we haven't i i don't think we
 
01:01:18.950 --> 01:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
haven't gotten to the committee reports
 
01:01:19.589 --> 01:01:19.599 align:start position:0%
yet so
 
01:01:23.190 --> 01:01:23.200 align:start position:0%
um right right i'll skip down to that
 
01:01:24.470 --> 01:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
actually because it's kind of oh do we
 
01:01:25.109 --> 01:01:25.119 align:start position:0%
have a question
 
01:01:27.670 --> 01:01:27.680 align:start position:0%
sorry i have a question mr chair um on
 
01:01:29.589 --> 01:01:29.599 align:start position:0%
the voting uh i understand
 
01:01:33.030 --> 01:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
uh there's still the rule no abstention
 
01:01:36.230 --> 01:01:36.240 align:start position:0%
you either regret yay or nay unless
 
01:01:39.030 --> 01:01:39.040 align:start position:0%
you were in the pulled out yeah if you
 
01:01:39.990 --> 01:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
were in the room
 
01:01:41.910 --> 01:01:41.920 align:start position:0%
and you do have not filed a conflict
 
01:01:43.349 --> 01:01:43.359 align:start position:0%
then you must vote
 
01:01:46.069 --> 01:01:46.079 align:start position:0%
that is correct i'll skip down to
 
01:01:47.510 --> 01:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
committee reports because it's kind of
 
01:01:48.870 --> 01:01:48.880 align:start position:0%
relevant to this part of it
 
01:01:51.750 --> 01:01:51.760 align:start position:0%
so as i talked about making the motions
 
01:01:53.750 --> 01:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
typically whoever makes the motion will
 
01:01:55.670 --> 01:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
write the committee report
 
01:01:57.430 --> 01:01:57.440 align:start position:0%
and that is what shows up in the
 
01:01:58.789 --> 01:01:58.799 align:start position:0%
calendar and
 
01:02:00.630 --> 01:02:00.640 align:start position:0%
there's some specific information that
 
01:02:02.470 --> 01:02:02.480 align:start position:0%
needs to be in the committee report and
 
01:02:03.990 --> 01:02:04.000 align:start position:0%
that is outlined pretty well in the
 
01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.190 align:start position:0%
that is outlined pretty well in the
handout

01:02:05.190 --> 01:02:05.200 align:start position:0%
handout
 
01:02:08.470 --> 01:02:08.480 align:start position:0%
and as we get into that we'll we'll kind
 
01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:08.789 align:start position:0%
and as we get into that we'll we'll kind
of

01:02:08.789 --> 01:02:08.799 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:02:11.029 --> 01:02:11.039 align:start position:0%
help you with that because it it can
 
01:02:12.470 --> 01:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
seem a little daunting at times the
 
01:02:14.710 --> 01:02:14.720 align:start position:0%
first couple of times you do it
 
01:02:17.190 --> 01:02:17.200 align:start position:0%
but if you know you're going to make the
 
01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:17.910 align:start position:0%
but if you know you're going to make the
motion

01:02:17.910 --> 01:02:17.920 align:start position:0%
motion
 
01:02:20.950 --> 01:02:20.960 align:start position:0%
this is a suggestion write the committee
 
01:02:22.390 --> 01:02:22.400 align:start position:0%
report beforehand
 
01:02:25.510 --> 01:02:25.520 align:start position:0%
and bring it with you and that way once
 
01:02:26.789 --> 01:02:26.799 align:start position:0%
you've made the motion you've already
 
01:02:27.829 --> 01:02:27.839 align:start position:0%
got the work done
 
01:02:29.190 --> 01:02:29.200 align:start position:0%
that committee report is all done you
 
01:02:30.470 --> 01:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
might have to edit it a little bit
 
01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:31.190 align:start position:0%
might have to edit it a little bit
perhaps

01:02:31.190 --> 01:02:31.200 align:start position:0%
perhaps
 
01:02:32.950 --> 01:02:32.960 align:start position:0%
you know if we've had some type of
 
01:02:34.230 --> 01:02:34.240 align:start position:0%
conversation that occurred in the
 
01:02:35.510 --> 01:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
executive committee that maybe
 
01:02:38.150 --> 01:02:38.160 align:start position:0%
perhaps changes it a little but if you
 
01:02:40.069 --> 01:02:40.079 align:start position:0%
can do that beforehand it will be a lot
 
01:02:41.430 --> 01:02:41.440 align:start position:0%
easier on you and it will be a lot
 
01:02:42.630 --> 01:02:42.640 align:start position:0%
easier on me
 
01:02:44.789 --> 01:02:44.799 align:start position:0%
and uh you can you can hand that in and
 
01:02:45.670 --> 01:02:45.680 align:start position:0%
we can edit it
 
01:02:47.829 --> 01:02:47.839 align:start position:0%
right then and there and it's done so
 
01:02:49.430 --> 01:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
just a suggestion something that i've
 
01:02:50.230 --> 01:02:50.240 align:start position:0%
tried to do
 
01:02:51.990 --> 01:02:52.000 align:start position:0%
because i do better sitting and writing
 
01:02:53.670 --> 01:02:53.680 align:start position:0%
them sometimes on my computer
 
01:02:55.510 --> 01:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
and have it all printed out and bring it
 
01:02:56.789 --> 01:02:56.799 align:start position:0%
with me and i can edit it a little bit
 
01:02:57.829 --> 01:02:57.839 align:start position:0%
if i need to
 
01:02:59.589 --> 01:02:59.599 align:start position:0%
i it's much easier to read too
 
01:03:01.589 --> 01:03:01.599 align:start position:0%
considering my handwriting isn't always
 
01:03:02.710 --> 01:03:02.720 align:start position:0%
the best
 
01:03:06.549 --> 01:03:06.559 align:start position:0%
right so just a another um
 
01:03:08.549 --> 01:03:08.559 align:start position:0%
aspect of that is that every committee
 
01:03:10.470 --> 01:03:10.480 align:start position:0%
report has to be
 
01:03:12.870 --> 01:03:12.880 align:start position:0%
reviewed by the chair and signed signed
 
01:03:14.549 --> 01:03:14.559 align:start position:0%
off on by the chair
 
01:03:17.750 --> 01:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh so um so you will um
 
01:03:19.910 --> 01:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
if it if the chair decides if the chair
 
01:03:21.829 --> 01:03:21.839 align:start position:0%
sees something that is problematic with
 
01:03:22.950 --> 01:03:22.960 align:start position:0%
your report
 
01:03:27.270 --> 01:03:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:30.470 --> 01:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
yes um the other thing is that if it's
 
01:03:31.589 --> 01:03:31.599 align:start position:0%
your first time
 
01:03:34.789 --> 01:03:34.799 align:start position:0%
or first couple of times uh going
 
01:03:36.390 --> 01:03:36.400 align:start position:0%
through writing a report
 
01:03:41.109 --> 01:03:41.119 align:start position:0%
uh feel free to lean on any of the um
 
01:03:43.430 --> 01:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
more more senior members because
 
01:03:44.789 --> 01:03:44.799 align:start position:0%
everyone has
 
01:03:47.510 --> 01:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
done this before and um you know has
 
01:03:49.270 --> 01:03:49.280 align:start position:0%
some experience with it and
 
01:03:52.789 --> 01:03:52.799 align:start position:0%
uh can give give you good advice
 
01:03:55.510 --> 01:03:55.520 align:start position:0%
and i will tell you there is really fun
 
01:03:57.670 --> 01:03:57.680 align:start position:0%
the first calendar you see that has your
 
01:03:57.680 --> 01:03:57.990 align:start position:0%
the first calendar you see that has your
name

01:03:57.990 --> 01:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
name
 
01:04:00.549 --> 01:04:00.559 align:start position:0%
and as as the committee report it's it's
 
01:04:02.150 --> 01:04:02.160 align:start position:0%
a really fun experience so
 
01:04:04.710 --> 01:04:04.720 align:start position:0%
don't shy away from it it's uh it's
 
01:04:05.589 --> 01:04:05.599 align:start position:0%
really uh
 
01:04:07.190 --> 01:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
it's it's all part of what you do and
 
01:04:08.549 --> 01:04:08.559 align:start position:0%
it's just a really cool part of being in
 
01:04:11.430 --> 01:04:11.440 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire house
 
01:04:14.309 --> 01:04:14.319 align:start position:0%
okay did i skip over anything uh we
 
01:04:16.150 --> 01:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
talked about rolls to
 
01:04:19.829 --> 01:04:19.839 align:start position:0%
roll calls i consent calendar i should
 
01:04:21.349 --> 01:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
talk about that one um
 
01:04:24.230 --> 01:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
so as i've said our committee works
 
01:04:25.349 --> 01:04:25.359 align:start position:0%
really well together
 
01:04:27.510 --> 01:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
many of our bills come out unanimous
 
01:04:29.829 --> 01:04:29.839 align:start position:0%
you'll you'll see a lot of 19 to zero
 
01:04:31.430 --> 01:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
votes come out of our committee
 
01:04:33.029 --> 01:04:33.039 align:start position:0%
and when that happens as long as it
 
01:04:34.950 --> 01:04:34.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a fiscal note
 
01:04:37.109 --> 01:04:37.119 align:start position:0%
or an appropriation then it can go on
 
01:04:39.430 --> 01:04:39.440 align:start position:0%
what's called the consent count
 
01:04:41.190 --> 01:04:41.200 align:start position:0%
and the important part of that is all
 
01:04:42.390 --> 01:04:42.400 align:start position:0%
the bills that go on the consent
 
01:04:44.549 --> 01:04:44.559 align:start position:0%
calendar when we get to the house floor
 
01:04:46.230 --> 01:04:46.240 align:start position:0%
that that whole consent calendar is
 
01:04:48.630 --> 01:04:48.640 align:start position:0%
going to be passed with one vote so this
 
01:04:51.670 --> 01:04:51.680 align:start position:0%
might be sometimes 70 or 80 bills in the
 
01:04:53.270 --> 01:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
consent calendar
 
01:04:56.870 --> 01:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
and uh there's no debate on those bills
 
01:04:59.349 --> 01:04:59.359 align:start position:0%
if they're on the consent calendar and
 
01:05:00.710 --> 01:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
if they get passed through that way it's
 
01:05:01.910 --> 01:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
really quick and easy
 
01:05:04.950 --> 01:05:04.960 align:start position:0%
now you we can put it on as on the
 
01:05:06.309 --> 01:05:06.319 align:start position:0%
consent calendar as a committee and i
 
01:05:07.670 --> 01:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
will ask you does anybody have an
 
01:05:08.950 --> 01:05:08.960 align:start position:0%
objection to this being placed on
 
01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:10.069 align:start position:0%
objection to this being placed on
consent

01:05:10.069 --> 01:05:10.079 align:start position:0%
consent
 
01:05:11.670 --> 01:05:11.680 align:start position:0%
and as long as no one does we'll put it
 
01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:13.910 align:start position:0%
and as long as no one does we'll put it
on

01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:05:16.150 --> 01:05:16.160 align:start position:0%
someone another member of the house or a
 
01:05:17.510 --> 01:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
member of you if you change your mind
 
01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:18.230 align:start position:0%
member of you if you change your mind
afterwards

01:05:18.230 --> 01:05:18.240 align:start position:0%
afterwards
 
01:05:19.990 --> 01:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
can pull that bill off in the consent
 
01:05:21.510 --> 01:05:21.520 align:start position:0%
calendar before it goes to the house
 
01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:22.150 align:start position:0%
calendar before it goes to the house
floor

01:05:22.150 --> 01:05:22.160 align:start position:0%
floor
 
01:05:23.910 --> 01:05:23.920 align:start position:0%
literally right up until the time of
 
01:05:25.430 --> 01:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
when the session starts
 
01:05:27.510 --> 01:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
and the uh the clerk will make that
 
01:05:28.950 --> 01:05:28.960 align:start position:0%
announcement are there any bills that
 
01:05:31.270 --> 01:05:31.280 align:start position:0%
need to be pulled off consent
 
01:05:32.950 --> 01:05:32.960 align:start position:0%
and then if not then we'll roll through
 
01:05:35.990 --> 01:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
and vote the consent calendar through so
 
01:05:37.990 --> 01:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
with us doing our work behind the scenes
 
01:05:39.670 --> 01:05:39.680 align:start position:0%
and in doing good job as committee and
 
01:05:41.510 --> 01:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
getting those bills under consent it
 
01:05:43.589 --> 01:05:43.599 align:start position:0%
really makes our floor time much less
 
01:05:44.789 --> 01:05:44.799 align:start position:0%
and it makes it
 
01:05:48.710 --> 01:05:48.720 align:start position:0%
go very smoothly judy peter
 
01:05:52.710 --> 01:05:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:55.029 --> 01:05:55.039 align:start position:0%
all right i guess we got it we talked
 
01:05:57.109 --> 01:05:57.119 align:start position:0%
about committee reports
 
01:06:00.150 --> 01:06:00.160 align:start position:0%
uh committee amendments sometimes the
 
01:06:00.789 --> 01:06:00.799 align:start position:0%
bills that
 
01:06:03.190 --> 01:06:03.200 align:start position:0%
we have come in need amendments in fact
 
01:06:04.069 --> 01:06:04.079 align:start position:0%
i'd say almost
 
01:06:06.230 --> 01:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
always there's something the committee
 
01:06:08.470 --> 01:06:08.480 align:start position:0%
will find could be a typo it could be
 
01:06:10.309 --> 01:06:10.319 align:start position:0%
something we pick up during testimony
 
01:06:11.589 --> 01:06:11.599 align:start position:0%
there's just some things that need to be
 
01:06:11.599 --> 01:06:12.789 align:start position:0%
there's just some things that need to be
changed

01:06:12.789 --> 01:06:12.799 align:start position:0%
changed
 
01:06:15.750 --> 01:06:15.760 align:start position:0%
so uh as that occurs and the committee
 
01:06:17.750 --> 01:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
decides how they want to go
 
01:06:20.630 --> 01:06:20.640 align:start position:0%
then usually a member will volunteer and
 
01:06:22.630 --> 01:06:22.640 align:start position:0%
pick up and take that committee over to
 
01:06:25.829 --> 01:06:25.839 align:start position:0%
ols and have an amendment drafted and
 
01:06:28.069 --> 01:06:28.079 align:start position:0%
that amendment that member will bring
 
01:06:29.430 --> 01:06:29.440 align:start position:0%
that amendment into
 
01:06:32.950 --> 01:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
the executive session and present it and
 
01:06:34.630 --> 01:06:34.640 align:start position:0%
and then the committee will take up that
 
01:06:36.470 --> 01:06:36.480 align:start position:0%
amendment and vote on it and
 
01:06:38.630 --> 01:06:38.640 align:start position:0%
if it passes then that will become part
 
01:06:40.309 --> 01:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
of the bill and it will go through that
 
01:06:40.319 --> 01:06:40.630 align:start position:0%
of the bill and it will go through that
way

01:06:40.630 --> 01:06:40.640 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:06:42.710 --> 01:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
and so that's when you're writing the
 
01:06:43.910 --> 01:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
committee report
 
01:06:45.510 --> 01:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
you want to remember that if an
 
01:06:47.270 --> 01:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
amendment has been added then
 
01:06:48.710 --> 01:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
it's important to note that in the
 
01:06:50.549 --> 01:06:50.559 align:start position:0%
committee report that as amendment
 
01:06:53.029 --> 01:06:53.039 align:start position:0%
as amended this bill will do such and
 
01:06:53.039 --> 01:06:54.309 align:start position:0%
as amended this bill will do such and
such

01:06:54.309 --> 01:06:54.319 align:start position:0%
such
 
01:06:58.470 --> 01:06:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:00.390 --> 01:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
uh the committee's final vote appears on
 
01:07:01.750 --> 01:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
the majority
 
01:07:04.549 --> 01:07:04.559 align:start position:0%
report so if we do have a bill that we
 
01:07:06.150 --> 01:07:06.160 align:start position:0%
don't all agree on and it doesn't go on
 
01:07:07.750 --> 01:07:07.760 align:start position:0%
consent calendar
 
01:07:09.430 --> 01:07:09.440 align:start position:0%
and uh let's say we have one that goes
 
01:07:10.789 --> 01:07:10.799 align:start position:0%
down party lines so we have ten
 
01:07:12.390 --> 01:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
republicans that vote yay and
 
01:07:15.270 --> 01:07:15.280 align:start position:0%
nine democrats that vote nay the report
 
01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:15.910 align:start position:0%
nine democrats that vote nay the report
will

01:07:15.910 --> 01:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
will
 
01:07:18.950 --> 01:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
majority report will be from in in that
 
01:07:20.470 --> 01:07:20.480 align:start position:0%
case would be from the republicans that
 
01:07:22.630 --> 01:07:22.640 align:start position:0%
voted yes all those that are accepting
 
01:07:24.710 --> 01:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
and they they would give their reasons
 
01:07:26.150 --> 01:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
why they supported it
 
01:07:28.390 --> 01:07:28.400 align:start position:0%
and anyone that was in the minority that
 
01:07:29.430 --> 01:07:29.440 align:start position:0%
wants to
 
01:07:31.270 --> 01:07:31.280 align:start position:0%
could write a minority report saying why
 
01:07:33.190 --> 01:07:33.200 align:start position:0%
you don't support it but the committee
 
01:07:33.990 --> 01:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
vote of
 
01:07:38.870 --> 01:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:42.950 --> 01:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
last thing i have here is field trips
 
01:07:45.109 --> 01:07:45.119 align:start position:0%
and again we we often as a committee
 
01:07:46.870 --> 01:07:46.880 align:start position:0%
want new field trips of farms or
 
01:07:49.670 --> 01:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
ag related businesses or perhaps uh yeah
 
01:07:50.870 --> 01:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
you know waste treatment plants or
 
01:07:52.069 --> 01:07:52.079 align:start position:0%
things of that nature whatever it is
 
01:07:53.990 --> 01:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
that falls under our purview
 
01:07:55.990 --> 01:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
right now obviously with the pandemic
 
01:07:57.910 --> 01:07:57.920 align:start position:0%
all of our our tours are kind of placed
 
01:07:58.470 --> 01:07:58.480 align:start position:0%
on hold
 
01:08:00.710 --> 01:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
but my hope is as we get through into
 
01:08:01.829 --> 01:08:01.839 align:start position:0%
summer and
 
01:08:04.390 --> 01:08:04.400 align:start position:0%
that the pandemic starts to get under
 
01:08:05.990 --> 01:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
better control that perhaps
 
01:08:08.470 --> 01:08:08.480 align:start position:0%
the the second half of our session we
 
01:08:09.910 --> 01:08:09.920 align:start position:0%
can start doing those uh
 
01:08:11.589 --> 01:08:11.599 align:start position:0%
again because it's a really fun
 
01:08:13.910 --> 01:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
experience that we as a committee get to
 
01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:14.150 align:start position:0%
experience that we as a committee get to
go

01:08:14.150 --> 01:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
go
 
01:08:17.189 --> 01:08:17.199 align:start position:0%
do and uh again it kind of helps us all
 
01:08:17.199 --> 01:08:17.590 align:start position:0%
do and uh again it kind of helps us all
the

01:08:17.590 --> 01:08:17.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:08:19.189 --> 01:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
just the camaraderie within our
 
01:08:20.789 --> 01:08:20.799 align:start position:0%
committee and it's it's an awful lot of
 
01:08:21.749 --> 01:08:21.759 align:start position:0%
fun you get to go
 
01:08:23.349 --> 01:08:23.359 align:start position:0%
see some really neat and interesting
 
01:08:23.359 --> 01:08:25.430 align:start position:0%
see some really neat and interesting
things

01:08:25.430 --> 01:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:08:27.590 --> 01:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
well with that i'm going to wrap up my
 
01:08:29.269 --> 01:08:29.279 align:start position:0%
area of it because that's all i have to
 
01:08:30.229 --> 01:08:30.239 align:start position:0%
say and
 
01:08:31.910 --> 01:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
yep go ahead peter just won't throw in
 
01:08:33.430 --> 01:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
one more thing that sort of fits in the
 
01:08:35.430 --> 01:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
field trip category maybe
 
01:08:38.470 --> 01:08:38.480 align:start position:0%
um usually uh near the beginning of the
 
01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:39.269 align:start position:0%
um usually uh near the beginning of the
session

01:08:39.269 --> 01:08:39.279 align:start position:0%
session
 
01:08:42.550 --> 01:08:42.560 align:start position:0%
we invite um the people from
 
01:08:44.950 --> 01:08:44.960 align:start position:0%
the departments that we deal with in to
 
01:08:46.709 --> 01:08:46.719 align:start position:0%
give us a little overview of
 
01:08:49.030 --> 01:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
of what they do so we'll be inviting in
 
01:08:50.149 --> 01:08:50.159 align:start position:0%
people from the department of
 
01:08:52.309 --> 01:08:52.319 align:start position:0%
agriculture markets and foods

work with them and
 
01:09:10.390 --> 01:09:10.400 align:start position:0%

uh people from unh to talk about
 
01:09:16.709 --> 01:09:16.719 align:start position:0%

hearings next week
 
01:09:33.590 --> 01:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
but i would fully anticipate that
 
01:09:35.110 --> 01:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
possibly the week after
 
01:09:36.870 --> 01:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
we may again i'm waiting for some
 
01:09:38.709 --> 01:09:38.719 align:start position:0%
guidance from the speaker's office on
 
01:09:40.550 --> 01:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
what day we can do that so
 
01:09:43.990 --> 01:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
i'll keep you uh keep you tuned in tune
 
01:09:45.749 --> 01:09:45.759 align:start position:0%
as we come to that
 
01:09:48.229 --> 01:09:48.239 align:start position:0%
anything else any uh questions judy go
 
01:09:49.510 --> 01:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
ahead yeah yeah
 
01:09:52.309 --> 01:09:52.319 align:start position:0%
so um one thing that we didn't touch on
 
01:09:52.870 --> 01:09:52.880 align:start position:0%
at all
 
01:09:54.870 --> 01:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
is how we are going to be receiving
 
01:09:57.189 --> 01:09:57.199 align:start position:0%
testimony for these hearings
 
01:09:59.750 --> 01:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
normally when we meet in our committee
 
01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:00.630 align:start position:0%
normally when we meet in our committee
room

01:10:00.630 --> 01:10:00.640 align:start position:0%
room
 
01:10:03.189 --> 01:10:03.199 align:start position:0%
and people came for the public hearings
 
01:10:04.310 --> 01:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
they would bring
 
01:10:07.110 --> 01:10:07.120 align:start position:0%
documents with them and distribute them
 
01:10:08.790 --> 01:10:08.800 align:start position:0%
to all the members
 
01:10:11.350 --> 01:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
to read we would also get emails from
 
01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:11.990 align:start position:0%
to read we would also get emails from
people

01:10:11.990 --> 01:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:10:14.630 --> 01:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
telling us uh their position on any
 
01:10:17.030 --> 01:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
particular piece of legislation
 
01:10:19.590 --> 01:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
and i suspect this time um you know
 
01:10:22.149 --> 01:10:22.159 align:start position:0%
since we won't have people coming
 
01:10:25.110 --> 01:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
in person that whatever documents they
 
01:10:26.630 --> 01:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
want to share with us
 
01:10:28.870 --> 01:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
i am sure they are going to send us via
 
01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:31.350 align:start position:0%
i am sure they are going to send us via
email

01:10:31.350 --> 01:10:31.360 align:start position:0%
email
 
01:10:34.790 --> 01:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
i think that the house is
 
01:10:37.830 --> 01:10:37.840 align:start position:0%
looking into having some sort of web
 
01:10:40.310 --> 01:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
page for every committee
 
01:10:43.669 --> 01:10:43.679 align:start position:0%
which will have links on it to display
 
01:10:45.830 --> 01:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
everybody's different piece of testimony
 
01:10:48.149 --> 01:10:48.159 align:start position:0%
but that hasn't happened yet
 
01:10:51.430 --> 01:10:51.440 align:start position:0%
and i just wanted to say that
 
01:10:53.669 --> 01:10:53.679 align:start position:0%
keep an eye on your email and with
 
01:10:58.070 --> 01:10:58.080 align:start position:0%
regard to specific pieces of legislation
 
01:11:01.110 --> 01:11:01.120 align:start position:0%

as what representative aaron was talking
 
01:11:09.350 --> 01:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
about we usually have a sign-in sheet
 
01:11:11.590 --> 01:11:11.600 align:start position:0%
um those signing in that are for or
 
01:11:12.870 --> 01:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
against the bill
 
01:11:16.070 --> 01:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
um how is that going to work
 
01:11:17.910 --> 01:11:17.920 align:start position:0%

the question
 
01:11:27.270 --> 01:11:27.280 align:start position:0%
talking about the blue sheets and the
 
01:11:29.110 --> 01:11:29.120 align:start position:0%
pink cards as to how that whole process
 
01:11:31.110 --> 01:11:31.120 align:start position:0%
is going to work when they're virtual
 
01:11:33.350 --> 01:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
we do not at this moment um i know that
 
01:11:34.950 --> 01:11:34.960 align:start position:0%
leadership is working on that
 
01:11:37.030 --> 01:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
um and i anticipate you'll have an
 
01:11:38.390 --> 01:11:38.400 align:start position:0%
answer this week but at the moment we
 
01:11:39.270 --> 01:11:39.280 align:start position:0%

because that's
 
01:15:17.430 --> 01:15:17.440 align:start position:0%
the fun part getting to know everybody
 
01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:17.750 align:start position:0%
the fun part getting to know everybody
and

01:15:17.750 --> 01:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:15:20.550 --> 01:15:20.560 align:start position:0%
talk about the grandkids and talk about
 
01:15:22.630 --> 01:15:22.640 align:start position:0%
you know what's going on at home
 
01:15:24.870 --> 01:15:24.880 align:start position:0%
that's what binds the committee together
 
01:15:27.270 --> 01:15:27.280 align:start position:0%
so hopefully by the time the term is
 
01:15:29.270 --> 01:15:29.280 align:start position:0%
over you're going to be able to
 
01:15:31.910 --> 01:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
meet comfortably together and go on
 
01:15:33.510 --> 01:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
those wonderful field trips which are
 
01:15:35.830 --> 01:15:35.840 align:start position:0%
always my favorite things to do
 
01:15:39.430 --> 01:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
as bob said um we both are
 
01:15:41.510 --> 01:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
agriculture and rural affairs policy
 
01:15:42.870 --> 01:15:42.880 align:start position:0%
consultants for
 
01:15:45.750 --> 01:15:45.760 align:start position:0%
council of state governments so bob do
 
01:15:46.550 --> 01:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
you want to start
 
01:15:48.310 --> 01:15:48.320 align:start position:0%
off with explaining just exactly what
 
01:15:51.510 --> 01:15:51.520 align:start position:0%
csg is and what we do
 
01:15:54.470 --> 01:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
and and uh just ahead to the two of us
 
01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:55.189 align:start position:0%
and and uh just ahead to the two of us
being

01:15:55.189 --> 01:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
being
 
01:15:57.590 --> 01:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
the consultants for agriculture and
 
01:15:57.600 --> 01:15:58.550 align:start position:0%
the consultants for agriculture and
rural

01:15:58.550 --> 01:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
rural
 
01:16:01.910 --> 01:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
uh uh we we job share that
 
01:16:05.510 --> 01:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
uh we decided to do that the day i lost
 
01:16:06.950 --> 01:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
my last election
 
01:16:10.870 --> 01:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
and we've been doing it ever since uh
 
01:16:14.390 --> 01:16:14.400 align:start position:0%
csg is a national
 
01:16:18.830 --> 01:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
organization that meets primarily
 
01:16:21.590 --> 01:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
regionally uh there there is a
 
01:16:23.350 --> 01:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
national organization that's
 
01:16:25.270 --> 01:16:25.280 align:start position:0%
headquartered in lexington
 
01:16:28.390 --> 01:16:28.400 align:start position:0%
kentucky uh
 
01:16:31.750 --> 01:16:31.760 align:start position:0%
but we have four regions there's at
 
01:16:34.870 --> 01:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
we are in the eastern region
 
01:16:38.229 --> 01:16:38.239 align:start position:0%
that includes 11 states
 
01:16:41.350 --> 01:16:41.360 align:start position:0%
from maryland and delaware up through
 
01:16:43.590 --> 01:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
new jersey pennsylvania and new york and
 
01:16:47.110 --> 01:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
all six new england states
 
01:16:50.310 --> 01:16:50.320 align:start position:0%
we also have five eastern canadian
 
01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:51.750 align:start position:0%
we also have five eastern canadian
provinces

01:16:51.750 --> 01:16:51.760 align:start position:0%
provinces
 
01:16:55.510 --> 01:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
uh from ontario over to
 
01:16:58.790 --> 01:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
uh not only quebec but the uh
 
01:17:01.910 --> 01:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
maritimes other than the
 
01:17:05.430 --> 01:17:05.440 align:start position:0%
newfoundland they they have chosen not
 
01:17:05.990 --> 01:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:17:10.149 --> 01:17:10.159 align:start position:0%
part of any organization legislatively
 
01:17:14.229 --> 01:17:14.239 align:start position:0%
um we also have
 
01:17:16.709 --> 01:17:16.719 align:start position:0%
it's certainly not northeast but we have
 
01:17:19.270 --> 01:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
puerto rico and the us virgin islands as
 
01:17:21.830 --> 01:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
part of our organization
 
01:17:24.950 --> 01:17:24.960 align:start position:0%
uh and i think that's simply because no
 
01:17:27.590 --> 01:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
one else asked them to join and we did
 
01:17:29.510 --> 01:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
and they came and have been a member
 
01:17:31.189 --> 01:17:31.199 align:start position:0%
ever since
 
01:17:34.550 --> 01:17:34.560 align:start position:0%
um one of the things
 
01:17:38.470 --> 01:17:38.480 align:start position:0%
i i really like about csg
 
01:17:41.430 --> 01:17:41.440 align:start position:0%
is we are regional uh you know the
 
01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:42.229 align:start position:0%
is we are regional uh you know the
problems

01:17:42.229 --> 01:17:42.239 align:start position:0%
problems
 
01:17:45.669 --> 01:17:45.679 align:start position:0%
in maryland or pennsylvania
 
01:17:47.910 --> 01:17:47.920 align:start position:0%
for agriculture are pretty much the
 
01:17:49.669 --> 01:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
exact same problems we have in new
 
01:17:49.679 --> 01:17:50.229 align:start position:0%
exact same problems we have in new
hampshire

01:17:50.229 --> 01:17:50.239 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:17:53.590 --> 01:17:53.600 align:start position:0%
or maine it really
 
01:17:56.709 --> 01:17:56.719 align:start position:0%
it it's not much different between our
 
01:17:56.719 --> 01:17:57.590 align:start position:0%
it it's not much different between our
state's

01:17:57.590 --> 01:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
state's
 
01:17:59.510 --> 01:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
delaware may be a little different with
 
01:18:01.590 --> 01:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
all those chickens down there
 
01:18:04.390 --> 01:18:04.400 align:start position:0%
and pretty flat land but uh it's
 
01:18:06.070 --> 01:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
certainly a whole lot different
 
01:18:10.149 --> 01:18:10.159 align:start position:0%
than agriculture in montana or iowa
 
01:18:14.550 --> 01:18:14.560 align:start position:0%
um so it's just kind of nice to all
 
01:18:17.189 --> 01:18:17.199 align:start position:0%
uh meet regionally with folks that have
 
01:18:17.990 --> 01:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
the same problems
 
01:18:23.350 --> 01:18:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:25.030 --> 01:18:25.040 align:start position:0%
i'll just give a little bit of the
 
01:18:26.709 --> 01:18:26.719 align:start position:0%
history of how
 
01:18:29.910 --> 01:18:29.920 align:start position:0%
csg came about uh
 
01:18:33.350 --> 01:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
there was a legislator in the northeast
 
01:18:36.550 --> 01:18:36.560 align:start position:0%
said hey you know we
 
01:18:39.590 --> 01:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
are having problems in one state we
 
01:18:41.750 --> 01:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
don't know what anybody else is doing
 
01:18:43.830 --> 01:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
we think it would be a great forum if we
 
01:18:45.750 --> 01:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
could get folks together
 
01:18:48.950 --> 01:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
uh from different states and it started
 
01:18:51.510 --> 01:18:51.520 align:start position:0%
out in the northeast
 
01:18:54.790 --> 01:18:54.800 align:start position:0%
and it's been going that way since 19 i
 
01:18:57.110 --> 01:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
think it was 37.
 
01:19:00.630 --> 01:19:00.640 align:start position:0%
uh so there's quite a history we started
 
01:19:02.709 --> 01:19:02.719 align:start position:0%
the northeast and it expanded
 
01:19:05.910 --> 01:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
became a national organization uh
 
01:19:09.510 --> 01:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
grew into four regions um
 
01:19:12.790 --> 01:19:12.800 align:start position:0%
it i i think it's one of the
 
01:19:14.950 --> 01:19:14.960 align:start position:0%
the the better regions is here in the
 
01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:15.990 align:start position:0%
the the better regions is here in the
northeast

01:19:15.990 --> 01:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
northeast
 
01:19:19.110 --> 01:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
if i can i interrupt can i do that
 
01:19:21.110 --> 01:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
thanks i have to interrupt him all the
 
01:19:22.390 --> 01:19:22.400 align:start position:0%
time anyway
 
01:19:25.030 --> 01:19:25.040 align:start position:0%
um council state governments is a
 
01:19:27.350 --> 01:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
membership organization
 
01:19:31.030 --> 01:19:31.040 align:start position:0%
uh the state legislatures themselves
 
01:19:34.709 --> 01:19:34.719 align:start position:0%
are the members so the fact that new
 
01:19:34.719 --> 01:19:35.510 align:start position:0%
are the members so the fact that new
hampshire

01:19:35.510 --> 01:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:19:39.030 --> 01:19:39.040 align:start position:0%
and all of the 11 states pays dues
 
01:19:41.350 --> 01:19:41.360 align:start position:0%
to council of state governments means
 
01:19:42.390 --> 01:19:42.400 align:start position:0%
that you
 
01:19:45.510 --> 01:19:45.520 align:start position:0%
all individually are members
 
01:19:49.510 --> 01:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
of csg erc and can take advantage of
 
01:19:51.510 --> 01:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
what we have to offer
 
01:19:54.790 --> 01:19:54.800 align:start position:0%
and what we have to offer is
 
01:19:57.990 --> 01:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
we do policy summits
 
01:20:01.750 --> 01:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
we do conferences we do webinars
 
01:20:05.510 --> 01:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
we write blogs but we also do research
 
01:20:06.229 --> 01:20:06.239 align:start position:0%
for you
 
01:20:09.990 --> 01:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
if you have a question or a problem
 
01:20:12.550 --> 01:20:12.560 align:start position:0%
it with some of your legislation that
 
01:20:12.560 --> 01:20:13.110 align:start position:0%
it with some of your legislation that
your

01:20:13.110 --> 01:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:20:15.590 --> 01:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
able committee researcher or assistant
 
01:20:17.189 --> 01:20:17.199 align:start position:0%
can't handle
 
01:20:20.550 --> 01:20:20.560 align:start position:0%
call us up and we will ask what other
 
01:20:23.030 --> 01:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
states are doing in our region
 
01:20:26.629 --> 01:20:26.639 align:start position:0%
on issues that are of importance to you
 
01:20:29.910 --> 01:20:29.920 align:start position:0%
um when we were
 
01:20:32.950 --> 01:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
chairs we were appointed to council
 
01:20:34.390 --> 01:20:34.400 align:start position:0%
state governments
 
01:20:37.030 --> 01:20:37.040 align:start position:0%
and we got so involved with the
 
01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:38.149 align:start position:0%
and we got so involved with the
organization

01:20:38.149 --> 01:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
organization
 
01:20:40.950 --> 01:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
which we encourage you to do as well and
 
01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:41.430 align:start position:0%
which we encourage you to do as well and
through

01:20:41.430 --> 01:20:41.440 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:20:45.270 --> 01:20:45.280 align:start position:0%
csg we got to meet legislators
 
01:20:48.229 --> 01:20:48.239 align:start position:0%
from vermont maine massachusetts
 
01:20:48.239 --> 01:20:49.350 align:start position:0%
from vermont maine massachusetts
connecticut

01:20:49.350 --> 01:20:49.360 align:start position:0%
connecticut
 
01:20:51.830 --> 01:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
and they became our friends so that we
 
01:20:52.950 --> 01:20:52.960 align:start position:0%
could call them up
 
01:20:55.270 --> 01:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
and say hey carolyn partridge over in
 
01:20:55.280 --> 01:20:56.149 align:start position:0%
and say hey carolyn partridge over in
vermont

01:20:56.149 --> 01:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
vermont
 
01:20:58.709 --> 01:20:58.719 align:start position:0%
what's going on with pet issues over
 
01:20:58.719 --> 01:20:59.270 align:start position:0%
what's going on with pet issues over
there

01:20:59.270 --> 01:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:21:01.110 --> 01:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
and we would have a nice long discussion
 
01:21:03.510 --> 01:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
about how they're dealing with issues
 
01:21:05.510 --> 01:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
any legislation that they've come up
 
01:21:06.950 --> 01:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
with that help
 
01:21:11.030 --> 01:21:11.040 align:start position:0%
um and having that wider
 
01:21:13.590 --> 01:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
view of what's going on rather than
 
01:21:15.910 --> 01:21:15.920 align:start position:0%
insular new hampshire alone
 
01:21:18.709 --> 01:21:18.719 align:start position:0%
really does help in developing good
 
01:21:18.719 --> 01:21:20.070 align:start position:0%
really does help in developing good
legislation

01:21:20.070 --> 01:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:21:24.790 --> 01:21:24.800 align:start position:0%
and networking is is is great
 
01:21:28.950 --> 01:21:28.960 align:start position:0%
but yeah i uh let me just tag on to that
 
01:21:32.070 --> 01:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
uh so often we would hear of a
 
01:21:35.750 --> 01:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
problem somewhere uh in new hampshire
 
01:21:37.990 --> 01:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
that we had to deal with
 
01:21:40.629 --> 01:21:40.639 align:start position:0%
and you know you sit there think you
 
01:21:42.709 --> 01:21:42.719 align:start position:0%
know i remember kevin ryan
 
01:21:45.110 --> 01:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
in connecticut talking about that and
 
01:21:46.470 --> 01:21:46.480 align:start position:0%
you call kevin up
 
01:21:49.590 --> 01:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
and he may have the answer for you
 
01:21:51.510 --> 01:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
uh or or at least something will send
 
01:21:53.510 --> 01:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
you off in the right direction
 
01:21:57.430 --> 01:21:57.440 align:start position:0%
uh so the the networking is
 
01:22:00.550 --> 01:22:00.560 align:start position:0%
just second to none uh i
 
01:22:02.950 --> 01:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
really encourage people to to get
 
01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:03.990 align:start position:0%
really encourage people to to get
involved

01:22:03.990 --> 01:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
involved
 
01:22:07.030 --> 01:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
and and do that networking uh it's worth
 
01:22:08.950 --> 01:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
it just for that
 
01:22:12.709 --> 01:22:12.719 align:start position:0%
uh the other thing i might go into is
 
01:22:15.750 --> 01:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
uh tara and i put on programs
 
01:22:18.709 --> 01:22:18.719 align:start position:0%
now our expertise is agriculture and
 
01:22:20.550 --> 01:22:20.560 align:start position:0%
rural policy
 
01:22:24.470 --> 01:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
uh we we put on programs we have
 
01:22:27.430 --> 01:22:27.440 align:start position:0%
an annual summer meeting it's always
 
01:22:28.229 --> 01:22:28.239 align:start position:0%
been in person
 
01:22:31.590 --> 01:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
it rotates between states and provinces
 
01:22:35.270 --> 01:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
uh and in fact we've even been deployed
 
01:22:40.950 --> 01:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:43.990 --> 01:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
we put on usually two different programs
 
01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:44.550 align:start position:0%
we put on usually two different programs
maybe

01:22:44.550 --> 01:22:44.560 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
01:22:47.669 --> 01:22:47.679 align:start position:0%
three at one of those annual meetings
 
01:22:51.750 --> 01:22:51.760 align:start position:0%
uh but every other committee meets we
 
01:22:55.189 --> 01:22:55.199 align:start position:0%
csg is not just agriculture and rural
 
01:22:58.070 --> 01:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
uh it's i'm gonna miss something but
 
01:22:59.110 --> 01:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
it's environment
 
01:23:03.350 --> 01:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
it's fiscal uh it's nuclear waste
 
01:23:06.470 --> 01:23:06.480 align:start position:0%
uh it's transportation uh
 
01:23:10.149 --> 01:23:10.159 align:start position:0%
education uh so there are several
 
01:23:12.229 --> 01:23:12.239 align:start position:0%
different committees in fact i think
 
01:23:13.750 --> 01:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
there are nine of them
 
01:23:17.669 --> 01:23:17.679 align:start position:0%
uh of which agricultural rural is is one
 
01:23:20.550 --> 01:23:20.560 align:start position:0%
uh tara and i have also put on some
 
01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:21.830 align:start position:0%
uh tara and i have also put on some
special

01:23:21.830 --> 01:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
special
 
01:23:25.430 --> 01:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
uh policy summits uh over the last
 
01:23:26.790 --> 01:23:26.800 align:start position:0%
couple of years
 
01:23:28.870 --> 01:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
uh we've we did one in wilmington
 
01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:29.910 align:start position:0%
uh we've we did one in wilmington
delaware

01:23:29.910 --> 01:23:29.920 align:start position:0%
delaware
 
01:23:32.709 --> 01:23:32.719 align:start position:0%
uh what else we do dara we did
 
01:23:34.070 --> 01:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
wilmington delaware
 
01:23:36.870 --> 01:23:36.880 align:start position:0%
on um rural broadband and we did
 
01:23:38.310 --> 01:23:38.320 align:start position:0%
providence rhode island
 
01:23:42.229 --> 01:23:42.239 align:start position:0%
on agri-tourism um we've done
 
01:23:46.310 --> 01:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
policy summits and conferences on hemp
 
01:23:50.310 --> 01:23:50.320 align:start position:0%
on the financial effects of covid19
 
01:23:53.750 --> 01:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
on agriculture and agriculture economy
 
01:23:56.790 --> 01:23:56.800 align:start position:0%
um yeah we we've done
 
01:23:58.790 --> 01:23:58.800 align:start position:0%
a lot of things and the one thing about
 
01:24:00.870 --> 01:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
csg is that we
 
01:24:04.870 --> 01:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
rely on you as our members to tell us
 
01:24:07.910 --> 01:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
what policy issues interest you
 
01:24:10.550 --> 01:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
and then we will put on webinars or
 
01:24:12.229 --> 01:24:12.239 align:start position:0%
conferences and get
 
01:24:15.510 --> 01:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
speakers and experts to actually talk to
 
01:24:16.950 --> 01:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
you and answer questions
 
01:24:19.910 --> 01:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
about anything that might be of interest
 
01:24:20.629 --> 01:24:20.639 align:start position:0%
to you
 
01:24:22.310 --> 01:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
whether it's on a bill that you're
 
01:24:23.990 --> 01:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
dealing with or just some
 
01:24:25.510 --> 01:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
area that you think new hampshire should
 
01:24:28.070 --> 01:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
be heading in as far as agriculture and
 
01:24:32.550 --> 01:24:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:36.470 --> 01:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
um we have usually
 
01:24:39.030 --> 01:24:39.040 align:start position:0%
somewhere between 20 and 30 people show
 
01:24:40.470 --> 01:24:40.480 align:start position:0%
up to
 
01:24:44.470 --> 01:24:44.480 align:start position:0%
any of our meetings or programs
 
01:24:47.750 --> 01:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
uh and they pretty much run from puerto
 
01:24:48.870 --> 01:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
rico up to
 
01:24:52.070 --> 01:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
ontario um so
 
01:24:54.229 --> 01:24:54.239 align:start position:0%
there's a good good cross-section of
 
01:24:54.239 --> 01:24:55.110 align:start position:0%
there's a good good cross-section of
people

01:24:55.110 --> 01:24:55.120 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:24:57.669 --> 01:24:57.679 align:start position:0%
uh one of the things we do at our annual
 
01:24:57.679 --> 01:24:58.229 align:start position:0%
uh one of the things we do at our annual
meeting

01:24:58.229 --> 01:24:58.239 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
01:25:01.510 --> 01:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
always on our very first meeting
 
01:25:04.629 --> 01:25:04.639 align:start position:0%
is we go around the room state by state
 
01:25:07.830 --> 01:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
and let each state talk about what they
 
01:25:10.149 --> 01:25:10.159 align:start position:0%
are with what their big issues are in
 
01:25:11.110 --> 01:25:11.120 align:start position:0%
their state and
 
01:25:13.990 --> 01:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
what kinds of things they're working on
 
01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:14.709 align:start position:0%
what kinds of things they're working on
and

01:25:14.709 --> 01:25:14.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:25:17.830 --> 01:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
uh that really is
 
01:25:20.390 --> 01:25:20.400 align:start position:0%
probably the the best thing we've ever
 
01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:21.030 align:start position:0%
probably the the best thing we've ever
done

01:25:21.030 --> 01:25:21.040 align:start position:0%
done
 
01:25:23.750 --> 01:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
we just do it every time and people love
 
01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:24.310 align:start position:0%
we just do it every time and people love
it

01:25:24.310 --> 01:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:25:26.310 --> 01:25:26.320 align:start position:0%
uh at least the representatives because
 
01:25:28.629 --> 01:25:28.639 align:start position:0%
they hear what's going on elsewhere
 
01:25:30.950 --> 01:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
uh and you know it's the kickoff to
 
01:25:32.229 --> 01:25:32.239 align:start position:0%
networking with
 
01:25:35.270 --> 01:25:35.280 align:start position:0%
with your peers in other states
 
01:25:38.870 --> 01:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:41.830 --> 01:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
let's see we offer research as well if
 
01:25:41.840 --> 01:25:42.229 align:start position:0%
let's see we offer research as well if
you

01:25:42.229 --> 01:25:42.239 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:25:45.110 --> 01:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
have a particular question that you
 
01:25:45.120 --> 01:25:45.590 align:start position:0%
have a particular question that you
can't

01:25:45.590 --> 01:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
can't
 
01:25:48.550 --> 01:25:48.560 align:start position:0%
really get an answer to that really
 
01:25:51.189 --> 01:25:51.199 align:start position:0%
involves what other states are doing
 
01:25:53.669 --> 01:25:53.679 align:start position:0%
um or if they've had any experience with
 
01:25:54.950 --> 01:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
a certain problem or
 
01:25:57.990 --> 01:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
issue call us up and we'll contact all
 
01:25:59.430 --> 01:25:59.440 align:start position:0%
the other states we'll do
 
01:26:02.709 --> 01:26:02.719 align:start position:0%
research into their existing laws and
 
01:26:05.189 --> 01:26:05.199 align:start position:0%
um policies that they have so that we
 
01:26:07.189 --> 01:26:07.199 align:start position:0%
can get back to you
 
01:26:09.990 --> 01:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
we're just another research arm for you
 
01:26:11.030 --> 01:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
to call on
 
01:26:12.950 --> 01:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
and it's all free so don't think that
 
01:26:14.629 --> 01:26:14.639 align:start position:0%
you're going to get charged for it
 
01:26:16.950 --> 01:26:16.960 align:start position:0%
or anything like that and we're sitting
 
01:26:17.830 --> 01:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
here at home
 
01:26:20.950 --> 01:26:20.960 align:start position:0%
just just give us a call yeah
 
01:26:24.629 --> 01:26:24.639 align:start position:0%
and and to add on to that uh
 
01:26:27.510 --> 01:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
about a year ago we got a call from new
 
01:26:27.520 --> 01:26:28.390 align:start position:0%
about a year ago we got a call from new
jersey

01:26:28.390 --> 01:26:28.400 align:start position:0%
jersey
 
01:26:31.430 --> 01:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
and it was from legislative staff
 
01:26:34.550 --> 01:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
asking if we've ever seen any issues
 
01:26:36.709 --> 01:26:36.719 align:start position:0%
with a fire marshal
 
01:26:40.629 --> 01:26:40.639 align:start position:0%
uh and we did a lot of research and we
 
01:26:41.510 --> 01:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
couldn't find
 
01:26:46.310 --> 01:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:48.149 --> 01:26:48.159 align:start position:0%
you know doing the right thing in this
 
01:26:49.350 --> 01:26:49.360 align:start position:0%
case i guess
 
01:26:53.030 --> 01:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
uh he went after
 
01:26:55.750 --> 01:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
the blueberry farms in new jersey and if
 
01:26:56.709 --> 01:26:56.719 align:start position:0%
you know much about
 
01:27:01.430 --> 01:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
new jersey that's probably their biggest
 
01:27:05.430 --> 01:27:05.440 align:start position:0%
uh agriculture industry is blueberries
 
01:27:08.629 --> 01:27:08.639 align:start position:0%
and uh he he went after them for
 
01:27:12.070 --> 01:27:12.080 align:start position:0%
workforce housing and insisted they had
 
01:27:13.270 --> 01:27:13.280 align:start position:0%
to have
 
01:27:15.910 --> 01:27:15.920 align:start position:0%
uh sprinkler systems in their workforce
 
01:27:15.920 --> 01:27:17.510 align:start position:0%
uh sprinkler systems in their workforce
housing

01:27:17.510 --> 01:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
housing
 
01:27:19.590 --> 01:27:19.600 align:start position:0%
and it was going to put some of those
 
01:27:20.870 --> 01:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
blueberry farms
 
01:27:24.070 --> 01:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
out of existence uh so
 
01:27:27.750 --> 01:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
we we did research across the country to
 
01:27:28.310 --> 01:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
see if
 
01:27:32.229 --> 01:27:32.239 align:start position:0%
any other state was requiring that
 
01:27:36.310 --> 01:27:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:39.189 --> 01:27:39.199 align:start position:0%
so we gave our research back to them and
 
01:27:41.350 --> 01:27:41.360 align:start position:0%
we haven't heard anything about it since
 
01:27:41.360 --> 01:27:42.629 align:start position:0%
we haven't heard anything about it since
but

01:27:42.629 --> 01:27:42.639 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:27:45.510 --> 01:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
but on a subject that's related to that
 
01:27:46.629 --> 01:27:46.639 align:start position:0%
i remember
 
01:27:50.390 --> 01:27:50.400 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire had a
 
01:27:53.669 --> 01:27:53.679 align:start position:0%
requirement um in their fire marshal
 
01:27:53.679 --> 01:27:54.550 align:start position:0%
requirement um in their fire marshal
division

01:27:54.550 --> 01:27:54.560 align:start position:0%
division
 
01:27:57.669 --> 01:27:57.679 align:start position:0%
that state farms
 
01:28:00.310 --> 01:28:00.320 align:start position:0%
and fairs i'm sorry bears had to have
 
01:28:02.629 --> 01:28:02.639 align:start position:0%
sprinkler systems in their barns
 
01:28:05.750 --> 01:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
um installing those are sometimes forty
 
01:28:07.510 --> 01:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
thousand fifty thousand dollars
 
01:28:10.470 --> 01:28:10.480 align:start position:0%
per building and these buildings are
 
01:28:10.480 --> 01:28:11.110 align:start position:0%
per building and these buildings are
used

01:28:11.110 --> 01:28:11.120 align:start position:0%
used
 
01:28:13.510 --> 01:28:13.520 align:start position:0%
maybe two weeks out of the year and so
 
01:28:15.110 --> 01:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
that would have put a lot of our little
 
01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:15.830 align:start position:0%
that would have put a lot of our little
local

01:28:15.830 --> 01:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
local
 
01:28:18.870 --> 01:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
um town fairs county fairs
 
01:28:21.590 --> 01:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
and state fairs out of business i think
 
01:28:23.590 --> 01:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
that they're still requiring that i
 
01:28:25.189 --> 01:28:25.199 align:start position:0%
don't know how they got around it but
 
01:28:25.199 --> 01:28:25.750 align:start position:0%
don't know how they got around it but
it's

01:28:25.750 --> 01:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:28:29.189 --> 01:28:29.199 align:start position:0%
it's issues like that that you can call
 
01:28:29.199 --> 01:28:29.430 align:start position:0%
it's issues like that that you can call
us

01:28:29.430 --> 01:28:29.440 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:28:31.910 --> 01:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
up for and we will be happy to do
 
01:28:37.030 --> 01:28:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:40.470 --> 01:28:40.480 align:start position:0%
uh we again we have
 
01:28:42.870 --> 01:28:42.880 align:start position:0%
an annual meeting that's usually in
 
01:28:44.070 --> 01:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
either july or
 
01:28:47.189 --> 01:28:47.199 align:start position:0%
august and again it's
 
01:28:50.390 --> 01:28:50.400 align:start position:0%
normally in different states
 
01:28:52.310 --> 01:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
it just kind of goes around it was
 
01:28:53.590 --> 01:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
supposed to have been
 
01:28:56.950 --> 01:28:56.960 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire uh
 
01:29:00.229 --> 01:29:00.239 align:start position:0%
past summer uh but because of covid
 
01:29:02.709 --> 01:29:02.719 align:start position:0%
it got cancelled and it became a virtual
 
01:29:02.719 --> 01:29:03.590 align:start position:0%
it got cancelled and it became a virtual
one

01:29:03.590 --> 01:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:29:07.110 --> 01:29:07.120 align:start position:0%
and it the next one was supposed to be
 
01:29:07.120 --> 01:29:07.430 align:start position:0%
and it the next one was supposed to be
in

01:29:07.430 --> 01:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:29:10.950 --> 01:29:10.960 align:start position:0%
ontario and it looks like that's been
 
01:29:12.950 --> 01:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
uh cancelled as the wrong word going to
 
01:29:14.470 --> 01:29:14.480 align:start position:0%
be virtual
 
01:29:17.669 --> 01:29:17.679 align:start position:0%
uh but new hampshire is going to be
 
01:29:21.110 --> 01:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
up for the year 2022 it's going to be
 
01:29:23.669 --> 01:29:23.679 align:start position:0%
held in manchester by then hopefully
 
01:29:25.669 --> 01:29:25.679 align:start position:0%
we're all going to be meeting in person
 
01:29:27.910 --> 01:29:27.920 align:start position:0%
and we can have conferences again
 
01:29:29.270 --> 01:29:29.280 align:start position:0%
fingers crossed
 
01:29:31.590 --> 01:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
and so we encourage you all to take
 
01:29:33.669 --> 01:29:33.679 align:start position:0%
advantage of going down to manchester
 
01:29:36.149 --> 01:29:36.159 align:start position:0%
and sitting in on all of the seminars
 
01:29:37.350 --> 01:29:37.360 align:start position:0%
and and
 
01:29:42.550 --> 01:29:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:47.990 --> 01:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh the the organization is also
 
01:29:57.350 --> 01:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:00.709 --> 01:30:00.719 align:start position:0%
our the chair for our our chairs for our
 
01:30:02.310 --> 01:30:02.320 align:start position:0%
committee our co-chairs
 
01:30:04.830 --> 01:30:04.840 align:start position:0%
uh it's senator judy schwenk from
 
01:30:07.189 --> 01:30:07.199 align:start position:0%
pennsylvania and carroll and partridge
 
01:30:10.310 --> 01:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
a legislative representative from
 
01:30:10.320 --> 01:30:12.870 align:start position:0%
a legislative representative from
vermont

01:30:12.870 --> 01:30:12.880 align:start position:0%
vermont
 
01:30:15.910 --> 01:30:15.920 align:start position:0%
that all of the committees are led by
 
01:30:19.669 --> 01:30:19.679 align:start position:0%
legislators as chairs we try to get one
 
01:30:22.790 --> 01:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
senator and one representative we try to
 
01:30:25.189 --> 01:30:25.199 align:start position:0%
get one from each party
 
01:30:28.470 --> 01:30:28.480 align:start position:0%
uh and uh it's
 
01:30:29.990 --> 01:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
actually we're we've been pretty
 
01:30:31.990 --> 01:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
successful in getting one from each
 
01:30:32.629 --> 01:30:32.639 align:start position:0%
party and
 
01:30:35.910 --> 01:30:35.920 align:start position:0%
including one senator one rep
 
01:30:39.669 --> 01:30:39.679 align:start position:0%
but also the entire eastern region
 
01:30:43.030 --> 01:30:43.040 align:start position:0%
is led by legislators
 
01:30:45.110 --> 01:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
and the alcoholic ones the ones that
 
01:30:47.430 --> 01:30:47.440 align:start position:0%
left in december
 
01:30:50.950 --> 01:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
again we're from new hampshire um
 
01:30:54.470 --> 01:30:54.480 align:start position:0%
why did i just go blank uh lucy webber
 
01:30:56.709 --> 01:30:56.719 align:start position:0%
from the house and sharon carson from
 
01:30:57.910 --> 01:30:57.920 align:start position:0%
the senate
 
01:31:01.030 --> 01:31:01.040 align:start position:0%
yes they were our chairs
 
01:31:04.149 --> 01:31:04.159 align:start position:0%
and our national chair was senator lou
 
01:31:04.159 --> 01:31:05.669 align:start position:0%
and our national chair was senator lou
d'alessandro

01:31:05.669 --> 01:31:05.679 align:start position:0%
d'alessandro
 
01:31:08.149 --> 01:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
from manchester united so we have a big
 
01:31:09.910 --> 01:31:09.920 align:start position:0%
new hampshire presence in the kansas
 
01:31:12.470 --> 01:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
state government
 
01:31:17.030 --> 01:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
one thing that i think that we um stress
 
01:31:21.030 --> 01:31:21.040 align:start position:0%
is that we as a region in new england
 
01:31:25.270 --> 01:31:25.280 align:start position:0%
are 11 northeastern states individually
 
01:31:28.709 --> 01:31:28.719 align:start position:0%
in washington don't have much of a voice
 
01:31:30.629 --> 01:31:30.639 align:start position:0%
i mean we're small little states we
 
01:31:32.470 --> 01:31:32.480 align:start position:0%
don't have a lot of clout
 
01:31:34.709 --> 01:31:34.719 align:start position:0%
but as a region when you group us all
 
01:31:37.189 --> 01:31:37.199 align:start position:0%
together 11 states speaking with one
 
01:31:37.199 --> 01:31:38.229 align:start position:0%
together 11 states speaking with one
voice

01:31:38.229 --> 01:31:38.239 align:start position:0%
voice
 
01:31:40.550 --> 01:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
which we do because we vote on issues
 
01:31:42.790 --> 01:31:42.800 align:start position:0%
and vote on resolutions
 
01:31:47.189 --> 01:31:47.199 align:start position:0%
um that we want to see past
 
01:31:49.990 --> 01:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
we submit that to washington and people
 
01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:50.870 align:start position:0%
we submit that to washington and people
look

01:31:50.870 --> 01:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
look
 
01:31:53.830 --> 01:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
they say oh new york state pennsylvania
 
01:31:55.590 --> 01:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
massachusetts connecticut
 
01:31:58.149 --> 01:31:58.159 align:start position:0%
are all in favor of this so let's take a
 
01:31:58.159 --> 01:31:58.629 align:start position:0%
are all in favor of this so let's take a
listen

01:31:58.629 --> 01:31:58.639 align:start position:0%
listen
 
01:32:02.149 --> 01:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
so um that is one thing that makes the
 
01:32:05.189 --> 01:32:05.199 align:start position:0%
eastern region of csg so valuable
 
01:32:08.229 --> 01:32:08.239 align:start position:0%
is that we have more clout because we
 
01:32:09.030 --> 01:32:09.040 align:start position:0%
speak as
 
01:32:12.229 --> 01:32:12.239 align:start position:0%
a group um whereas we wouldn't
 
01:32:12.239 --> 01:32:15.189 align:start position:0%
a group um whereas we wouldn't
individually

01:32:15.189 --> 01:32:15.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:17.669 --> 01:32:17.679 align:start position:0%
another thing that we're doing is and i
 
01:32:19.590 --> 01:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
see this happening more and more
 
01:32:21.990 --> 01:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
is the latest thing is interstate
 
01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:23.430 align:start position:0%
is the latest thing is interstate
compact

01:32:23.430 --> 01:32:23.440 align:start position:0%
compact
 
01:32:26.629 --> 01:32:26.639 align:start position:0%
cross border working together
 
01:32:30.870 --> 01:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
um as a region and
 
01:32:35.430 --> 01:32:35.440 align:start position:0%
we are looking into doing a number of
 
01:32:38.870 --> 01:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
um compacts up here in the northeast
 
01:32:40.709 --> 01:32:40.719 align:start position:0%
so that should be interesting one of
 
01:32:42.310 --> 01:32:42.320 align:start position:0%
them is going to be on
 
01:32:44.709 --> 01:32:44.719 align:start position:0%
state need inspection programs being
 
01:32:45.430 --> 01:32:45.440 align:start position:0%
able to cross
 
01:32:48.550 --> 01:32:48.560 align:start position:0%
different lines um another is
 
01:32:51.830 --> 01:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
teacher certification and education
 
01:32:54.390 --> 01:32:54.400 align:start position:0%
it's issues like this that we can maybe
 
01:32:55.830 --> 01:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
work as a region
 
01:32:58.390 --> 01:32:58.400 align:start position:0%
so that it's not all just little pods
 
01:33:00.310 --> 01:33:00.320 align:start position:0%
working against each other
 
01:33:02.070 --> 01:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
one thing one issue that we're going to
 
01:33:03.270 --> 01:33:03.280 align:start position:0%
be dealing with we're going to have a
 
01:33:05.910 --> 01:33:05.920 align:start position:0%
webinar on this in february
 
01:33:09.030 --> 01:33:09.040 align:start position:0%
is the potential to set up regional
 
01:33:12.709 --> 01:33:12.719 align:start position:0%
food systems as you remember
 
01:33:15.510 --> 01:33:15.520 align:start position:0%
in march and april when cobit first came
 
01:33:15.520 --> 01:33:16.470 align:start position:0%
in march and april when cobit first came
out

01:33:16.470 --> 01:33:16.480 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:33:19.110 --> 01:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
the agricultural marketing and food
 
01:33:19.120 --> 01:33:20.310 align:start position:0%
the agricultural marketing and food
delivery

01:33:20.310 --> 01:33:20.320 align:start position:0%
delivery
 
01:33:23.350 --> 01:33:23.360 align:start position:0%
was horribly um
 
01:33:26.790 --> 01:33:26.800 align:start position:0%
destroyed so we in order to prevent that
 
01:33:28.550 --> 01:33:28.560 align:start position:0%
from happening again
 
01:33:30.870 --> 01:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
um regions are getting together states
 
01:33:32.310 --> 01:33:32.320 align:start position:0%
are getting together to
 
01:33:35.350 --> 01:33:35.360 align:start position:0%
look to see how we can
 
01:33:38.950 --> 01:33:38.960 align:start position:0%
small in make smaller and more localize
 
01:33:41.430 --> 01:33:41.440 align:start position:0%
our food production and food
 
01:33:41.440 --> 01:33:42.390 align:start position:0%
our food production and food
transportation

01:33:42.390 --> 01:33:42.400 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
01:33:45.430 --> 01:33:45.440 align:start position:0%
delivery in potential
 
01:33:48.550 --> 01:33:48.560 align:start position:0%
crisis times or emergency
 
01:33:50.870 --> 01:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
situations we don't want to starve up
 
01:33:52.390 --> 01:33:52.400 align:start position:0%
here just because we can't get food
 
01:33:54.790 --> 01:33:54.800 align:start position:0%
in from california so that's one thing
 
01:33:56.229 --> 01:33:56.239 align:start position:0%
that we're going to be looking in
 
01:33:59.350 --> 01:33:59.360 align:start position:0%
we'll send you all links to that
 
01:34:01.750 --> 01:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
these webinars that we're holding anyone
 
01:34:04.070 --> 01:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
can join in there's no cost
 
01:34:07.590 --> 01:34:07.600 align:start position:0%
so watch for emails from us
 
01:34:09.590 --> 01:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
with links and invitations so we hope
 
01:34:13.750 --> 01:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:16.629 --> 01:34:16.639 align:start position:0%
uh one of the things we're going to talk
 
01:34:18.310 --> 01:34:18.320 align:start position:0%
about this summer
 
01:34:21.430 --> 01:34:21.440 align:start position:0%
at our summer program again will be
 
01:34:25.590 --> 01:34:25.600 align:start position:0%
uh rural broadband
 
01:34:28.709 --> 01:34:28.719 align:start position:0%
we've had several different sessions on
 
01:34:32.310 --> 01:34:32.320 align:start position:0%
broadband but it continues to be a hot
 
01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:33.110 align:start position:0%
broadband but it continues to be a hot
topic

01:34:33.110 --> 01:34:33.120 align:start position:0%
topic
 
01:34:36.149 --> 01:34:36.159 align:start position:0%
especially because of covet uh with
 
01:34:39.270 --> 01:34:39.280 align:start position:0%
all the kids at home and you know
 
01:34:41.189 --> 01:34:41.199 align:start position:0%
what happens when they don't have
 
01:34:43.270 --> 01:34:43.280 align:start position:0%
broadband that they can use
 
01:34:46.709 --> 01:34:46.719 align:start position:0%
to get into the schools uh in fact my
 
01:34:51.030 --> 01:34:51.040 align:start position:0%
my grandson is one of them um
 
01:34:53.350 --> 01:34:53.360 align:start position:0%
so uh we're going to cover that again
 
01:34:54.310 --> 01:34:54.320 align:start position:0%
this summer
 
01:34:57.750 --> 01:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
uh i i'll also go back to uh
 
01:35:00.550 --> 01:35:00.560 align:start position:0%
the interstate compacts just for one
 
01:35:00.560 --> 01:35:01.189 align:start position:0%
the interstate compacts just for one
second

01:35:01.189 --> 01:35:01.199 align:start position:0%
second
 
01:35:03.030 --> 01:35:03.040 align:start position:0%
one of the things we talked about one
 
01:35:04.709 --> 01:35:04.719 align:start position:0%
time and and
 
01:35:08.629 --> 01:35:08.639 align:start position:0%
really never finished following up on
 
01:35:12.950 --> 01:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
but um we have farmers that live
 
01:35:15.590 --> 01:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
in corners of states or on state
 
01:35:15.600 --> 01:35:16.550 align:start position:0%
in corners of states or on state
boundaries

01:35:16.550 --> 01:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
boundaries
 
01:35:19.830 --> 01:35:19.840 align:start position:0%
that may have land uh that they are
 
01:35:19.840 --> 01:35:20.390 align:start position:0%
that may have land uh that they are
farming

01:35:20.390 --> 01:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
farming
 
01:35:23.430 --> 01:35:23.440 align:start position:0%
in two different states uh in fact i
 
01:35:24.550 --> 01:35:24.560 align:start position:0%
believe we
 
01:35:28.310 --> 01:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
we i know we had one in cheshire county
 
01:35:30.950 --> 01:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
that had land in three different states
 
01:35:31.669 --> 01:35:31.679 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:35:35.590 --> 01:35:35.600 align:start position:0%
vermont and massachusetts
 
01:35:38.950 --> 01:35:38.960 align:start position:0%
and uh they have to go
 
01:35:41.590 --> 01:35:41.600 align:start position:0%
and get a pesticide permit from all
 
01:35:43.109 --> 01:35:43.119 align:start position:0%
three states
 
01:35:47.030 --> 01:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
uh and pay for it uh
 
01:35:48.550 --> 01:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
you know they've got to keep up the
 
01:35:51.109 --> 01:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
credits on it uh
 
01:35:53.109 --> 01:35:53.119 align:start position:0%
why can't we have an interstate compact
 
01:35:54.149 --> 01:35:54.159 align:start position:0%
that says
 
01:35:55.910 --> 01:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
you know if you've got a pesticide
 
01:35:57.750 --> 01:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
permit in one state
 
01:36:00.550 --> 01:36:00.560 align:start position:0%
it it'll be good in all three states if
 
01:36:02.709 --> 01:36:02.719 align:start position:0%
you have landed in all three
 
01:36:07.910 --> 01:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:11.189 --> 01:36:11.199 align:start position:0%
