00:23:16.549 --> 00:23:16.559 align:start position:0%
um as you can see this is not a typical
 
00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:18.400 align:start position:0%
house or senate meeting this is a joint
 
00:23:20.149 --> 00:23:20.159 align:start position:0%
meeting not all members of each
 
00:23:22.789 --> 00:23:22.799 align:start position:0%
committee are present
 
00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:25.280 align:start position:0%
but before we begin introductions i
 
00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
would like to say as i mentioned we are
 
00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
here at the brentwood county superior
 
00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:32.240 align:start position:0%
courthouse we are here with the
 
00:23:36.149 --> 00:23:36.159 align:start position:0%
permission of the superior court and um
 
00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:38.240 align:start position:0%
others involved in the administration of
 
00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
this court in the ownership of the
 
00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
building and i'm not sure whether in
 
00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:42.640 align:start position:0%
rockingham if that includes the county
 
00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:44.080 align:start position:0%
commissioners or not but they're
 
00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
certainly aware please understand that
 
00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
this has that the superior court or the
 
00:23:51.029 --> 00:23:51.039 align:start position:0%
court system of new hampshire and i'm
 
00:23:53.669 --> 00:23:53.679 align:start position:0%
referring to this as the superior court
 
00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:55.200 align:start position:0%
this is the family court and the
 
00:23:57.669 --> 00:23:57.679 align:start position:0%
superior court for brentwood for
 
00:23:59.190 --> 00:23:59.200 align:start position:0%
rockingham county
 
00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
but the courts have nothing to do with
 
00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:03.440 align:start position:0%
this process
 
00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
they don't know what we're talking about
 
00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:08.240 align:start position:0%
i don't know that they have any idea
 
00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
that this meeting is actually really
 
00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
occurring outside of the administration
 
00:24:13.909 --> 00:24:13.919 align:start position:0%
office they have been very accommodating
 
00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
to us to allow us to use this it has
 
00:24:18.789 --> 00:24:18.799 align:start position:0%
good parking and is fairly central for
 
00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
rockingham county so we thank the court
 
00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
system of new hampshire for letting us
 
00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
use this facility but again they have
 
00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
absolutely nothing to do
 
00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
with the process and have had no input
 
00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:32.240 align:start position:0%
whatsoever in regards to the process
 
00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:36.149 align:start position:0%
whatsoever in regards to the process
itself

00:24:36.149 --> 00:24:36.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
i have a former judge here you know i
 
00:24:40.549 --> 00:24:40.559 align:start position:0%
wanted to also make sure i did that
 
00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
all right so the first thing i want to
 
00:24:44.149 --> 00:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
do is let you know who we have here
 
00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:46.640 align:start position:0%
tonight as i said we have the senate and
 
00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:49.120 align:start position:0%
the house the senate is conducting its
 
00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:51.440 align:start position:0%
own hearing the house is conducting a
 
00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
hearing and with us is senator gray who
 
00:24:56.950 --> 00:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
is chair of the senate committee on
 
00:24:58.310 --> 00:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
redistricting and so i'd like to
 
00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:00.240 align:start position:0%
recognize senator gray and ask him to
 
00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
introduce the senate members with us
 
00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:03.440 align:start position:0%
tonight well thank you very much uh just
 
00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:06.240 align:start position:0%
a couple of um housekeeping notes
 
00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:08.720 align:start position:0%
uh senate rules don't allow cheering
 
00:25:11.029 --> 00:25:11.039 align:start position:0%
booing uh that kind of things that's
 
00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:12.640 align:start position:0%
inappropriate for
 
00:25:14.549 --> 00:25:14.559 align:start position:0%
the venue that we're in
 
00:25:16.789 --> 00:25:16.799 align:start position:0%

00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:26.400 align:start position:0%

00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:35.440 align:start position:0%
good evening
 
00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
my name is
 
00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
jane armstrong
 
00:29:41.909 --> 00:29:41.919 align:start position:0%
and i'm a resident of exeter here in
 
00:29:44.149 --> 00:29:44.159 align:start position:0%
rockingham county
 
00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned about a fair non-partisan
 
00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:51.200 align:start position:0%
and transparent redistricting process
 
00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:53.440 align:start position:0%
this evening however i would like to
 
00:29:56.389 --> 00:29:56.399 align:start position:0%
speak to just one piece of the process
 
00:29:58.789 --> 00:29:58.799 align:start position:0%
but an important one
 
00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
this topic is ensuring that every
 
00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
eligible town has its own district
 
00:30:09.510 --> 00:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire we're very proud of our
 
00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:10.789 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire we're very proud of our
unique

00:30:10.789 --> 00:30:10.799 align:start position:0%
unique
 
00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:14.480 align:start position:0%
legislature of 400 representatives we
 
00:30:17.070 --> 00:30:17.080 align:start position:0%
talk about how it enables us to meet our
 
00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:19.840 align:start position:0%
representatives in our daily lives
 
00:30:22.389 --> 00:30:22.399 align:start position:0%
shopping at transfer stations and town
 
00:30:22.399 --> 00:30:23.990 align:start position:0%
shopping at transfer stations and town
events

00:30:23.990 --> 00:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
events
 
00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:27.200 align:start position:0%
this is why in 2006
 
00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
we voted to pass the constitutional
 
00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:30.710 align:start position:0%
we voted to pass the constitutional
amendment

00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:30.720 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
which says
 
00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:34.720 align:start position:0%
that when a town population
 
00:30:37.029 --> 00:30:37.039 align:start position:0%
is within a reasonable deviation from
 
00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:39.200 align:start position:0%
the ideal population
 
00:30:44.149 --> 00:30:44.159 align:start position:0%
which this year 2020 is 3444
 
00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:51.990 --> 00:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
shall have its own district
 
00:30:56.630 --> 00:30:56.640 align:start position:0%
so now giving towns of 3444
 
00:30:59.190 --> 00:30:59.200 align:start position:0%
their own representative is internal in
 
00:31:01.669 --> 00:31:01.679 align:start position:0%
our constitution
 
00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:04.480 align:start position:0%
here in rockingham county
 
00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
14 that's 14
 
00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:10.720 align:start position:0%
towns were eligible in 2010 for their
 
00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
own district
 
00:31:13.350 --> 00:31:13.360 align:start position:0%

00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:15.600 align:start position:0%

number of 3192
 
00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:20.640 align:start position:0%
but they were denying it
 
00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:22.720 align:start position:0%

00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
i'm asking you to give these towns and
 
00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
others in the state
 
00:31:49.669 --> 00:31:49.679 align:start position:0%
what the new hampshire constitution
 
00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
guarantees them
 
00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
they deserve to have representatives who
 
00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
have been in town
 
00:31:58.310 --> 00:31:58.320 align:start position:0%
representatives who know the people
 
00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
and the issues
 
00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:03.200 align:start position:0%
i also wonder why
 
00:32:06.149 --> 00:32:06.159 align:start position:0%
if it was so hard in 2010
 
00:32:08.909 --> 00:32:08.919 align:start position:0%
why has nothing been done to make the
 
00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:12.240 align:start position:0%
legislative and constitutional changes
 
00:32:14.389 --> 00:32:14.399 align:start position:0%
to fix this problem
 
00:32:17.669 --> 00:32:17.679 align:start position:0%
the legislature has had 10 years
 
00:32:19.029 --> 00:32:19.039 align:start position:0%
i suspect
 
00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:20.640 align:start position:0%
that it's possible there are some who
 
00:32:22.630 --> 00:32:22.640 align:start position:0%
don't want to fix it
 
00:32:25.669 --> 00:32:25.679 align:start position:0%
i understand that the math makes it hard
 
00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
to get every eligible town its own
 
00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:28.950 align:start position:0%
to get every eligible town its own
district

00:32:28.950 --> 00:32:28.960 align:start position:0%
district
 
00:32:31.509 --> 00:32:31.519 align:start position:0%
but surely you can make the effort to
 
00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:34.720 align:start position:0%
get these towns the representative
 
00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
station they deserve and are
 
00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
entitled to receive
 
00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:49.509 --> 00:32:49.519 align:start position:0%
i said i didn't have written testimony
 
00:32:50.710 --> 00:32:50.720 align:start position:0%
feel free to give it to us and we'll
 
00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
make sure that a copy gets okay
 
00:32:57.350 --> 00:32:57.360 align:start position:0%

00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:22.840 align:start position:0%
thank you see you in the
 
00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
morning this is from our bill of rights
 
00:33:29.669 --> 00:33:29.679 align:start position:0%
ratified in 1798 it's article 10.
 
00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:31.120 align:start position:0%
government being instituted for the
 
00:33:32.789 --> 00:33:32.799 align:start position:0%
common benefit protection and security
 
00:33:34.389 --> 00:33:34.399 align:start position:0%
of the whole community
 
00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
and not for the private interest
 
00:33:38.070 --> 00:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
surrounding any one man family or class
 
00:33:40.389 --> 00:33:40.399 align:start position:0%
of men therefore whenever the ends of
 
00:33:42.149 --> 00:33:42.159 align:start position:0%
government are perverted
 
00:33:44.630 --> 00:33:44.640 align:start position:0%
and public liberty manifestly endangered
 
00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:46.240 align:start position:0%
all other means of redress are
 
00:33:48.789 --> 00:33:48.799 align:start position:0%
ineffectual the people may and right
 
00:33:50.789 --> 00:33:50.799 align:start position:0%
ought to reform the old or establish a
 
00:33:52.470 --> 00:33:52.480 align:start position:0%
new government the doctrine of
 
00:33:54.549 --> 00:33:54.559 align:start position:0%
non-resistance against arbitrary power
 
00:33:56.710 --> 00:33:56.720 align:start position:0%
and oppression is absurd slavish and
 
00:33:58.310 --> 00:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
destructive the good the happiness of
 
00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
mankind so i make sure you all know that
 
00:34:03.269 --> 00:34:03.279 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:34:04.710 --> 00:34:04.720 align:start position:0%
i just want to talk about a couple of
 
00:34:06.549 --> 00:34:06.559 align:start position:0%
the phrases in here
 
00:34:08.790 --> 00:34:08.800 align:start position:0%
all right when all other means of
 
00:34:11.109 --> 00:34:11.119 align:start position:0%
redress are ineffectual that means we
 
00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:12.720 align:start position:0%
need to put in the effort
 
00:34:14.869 --> 00:34:14.879 align:start position:0%
to try to make things right
 
00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:16.720 align:start position:0%
and to get the government to represent
 
00:34:19.109 --> 00:34:19.119 align:start position:0%
the people so the last 20 years we've
 
00:34:20.389 --> 00:34:20.399 align:start position:0%
lived under
 
00:34:22.629 --> 00:34:22.639 align:start position:0%
gerrymandering and by the way it is gary
 
00:34:24.629 --> 00:34:24.639 align:start position:0%
it's named dr albert gary and that's how
 
00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
you pronounce his name
 
00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:27.510 align:start position:0%
you pronounce his name
and

00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:34:29.829 --> 00:34:29.839 align:start position:0%
we need to try to fix that now
 
00:34:32.069 --> 00:34:32.079 align:start position:0%
a hundred dollars a year is not much so
 
00:34:34.790 --> 00:34:34.800 align:start position:0%
we greatly appreciate the time to drive
 
00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:36.720 align:start position:0%
around to all the different counties and
 
00:34:38.790 --> 00:34:38.800 align:start position:0%
listen to people and it's an incredible
 
00:34:40.470 --> 00:34:40.480 align:start position:0%
first step it's the right thing to do to
 
00:34:43.349 --> 00:34:43.359 align:start position:0%
listen to people and understand what we
 
00:34:45.669 --> 00:34:45.679 align:start position:0%
think is broken all right but the most
 
00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:48.720 align:start position:0%
important step is the second step
 
00:34:51.270 --> 00:34:51.280 align:start position:0%
and that comes once you start coming up
 
00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:53.200 align:start position:0%
with a first proposal
 
00:34:56.069 --> 00:34:56.079 align:start position:0%
to make sure that people have the time
 
00:34:58.550 --> 00:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
to look at it and make sure there's not
 
00:35:01.589 --> 00:35:01.599 align:start position:0%
even the slightest suspicion of any
 
00:35:01.599 --> 00:35:03.190 align:start position:0%
even the slightest suspicion of any
gerrymandering

00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:03.200 align:start position:0%
gerrymandering
 
00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
as you just heard
 
00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
rye is one of the 74 towns that put
 
00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:08.720 align:start position:0%
forth petition
 
00:35:09.910 --> 00:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
or motion
 
00:35:12.870 --> 00:35:12.880 align:start position:0%
saying that we want our town leaders to
 
00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:14.480 align:start position:0%
let the new hampshire general court know
 
00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:17.440 align:start position:0%
that we expect an open and transparent
 
00:35:20.069 --> 00:35:20.079 align:start position:0%
process with no gerrymandering now i
 
00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
don't know i think you've heard from the
 
00:35:23.589 --> 00:35:23.599 align:start position:0%
town leaders abroad
 
00:35:25.109 --> 00:35:25.119 align:start position:0%
saying that that's what the people voted
 
00:35:25.119 --> 00:35:26.550 align:start position:0%
saying that that's what the people voted
for

00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:26.560 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
i don't see them here
 
00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
i just spoke to representative she
 
00:35:32.069 --> 00:35:32.079 align:start position:0%
hasn't heard from them
 
00:35:33.990 --> 00:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
so it's hard we're trying we're trying
 
00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
to get through that this is
 
00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
gary mandering does not want the people
 
00:35:40.150 --> 00:35:40.160 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire at least the 74 people
 
00:35:41.829 --> 00:35:41.839 align:start position:0%
that went through the effort of getting
 
00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:44.240 align:start position:0%
that warrant article passed on and by
 
00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:46.960 align:start position:0%
the way selected to support it and ryan
 
00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
so what's the second part i wanted to
 
00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
talk about was
 
00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:53.680 align:start position:0%
amulet of any one man family or class of
 
00:35:55.750 --> 00:35:55.760 align:start position:0%
men now emulate i had to look it up the
 
00:35:57.270 --> 00:35:57.280 align:start position:0%
first time i read this it means to
 
00:35:59.750 --> 00:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
benefit and i think we can agree that
 
00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
the class of men is a political party
 
00:36:03.829 --> 00:36:03.839 align:start position:0%
now i've been reaching out to bill
 
00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:05.440 align:start position:0%
gardner and dave scanlon they haven't
 
00:36:07.990 --> 00:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
told me but maybe they'll tell you
 
00:36:09.910 --> 00:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
how much does the state pay for the two
 
00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
primaries excuse me the primaries every
 
00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:14.480 align:start position:0%
two years for the parties
 
00:36:16.069 --> 00:36:16.079 align:start position:0%
you should know that number because it's
 
00:36:17.349 --> 00:36:17.359 align:start position:0%
our money
 
00:36:19.030 --> 00:36:19.040 align:start position:0%
all right also you need to look at what
 
00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:21.520 align:start position:0%
the towns and cities spend on that
 
00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:23.440 align:start position:0%
election every two years
 
00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
on top of that our town we voted one of
 
00:36:27.910 --> 00:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
the schools they closed the other school
 
00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
so it's a lost state of education it's a
 
00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:32.480 align:start position:0%
big investment that the people in new
 
00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire are paying for and when it's
 
00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:36.640 align:start position:0%
benefiting a class of men or the
 
00:36:39.109 --> 00:36:39.119 align:start position:0%
political party it's going against our
 
00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
constitution and we just heard from the
 
00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
previous speaker rye is also one of
 
00:36:46.630 --> 00:36:46.640 align:start position:0%
those towns um the census says we've got
 
00:36:48.790 --> 00:36:48.800 align:start position:0%
5 400
 
00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
people we've had that for a while
 
00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:52.720 align:start position:0%
november we had over 6 000 people who
 
00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:54.720 align:start position:0%
voted a lot of those were the 20 year
 
00:36:56.470 --> 00:36:56.480 align:start position:0%
olds that moved back i don't think it
 
00:36:57.910 --> 00:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
was quite 600
 
00:36:57.920 --> 00:36:58.870 align:start position:0%
was quite 600
but

00:36:58.870 --> 00:36:58.880 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:37:00.310 --> 00:37:00.320 align:start position:0%
with the
 
00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:01.430 align:start position:0%
with the
0.7

00:37:01.430 --> 00:37:01.440 align:start position:0%
0.7
 
00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
miles on route 1 with almost every
 
00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
parcel being developed the next few
 
00:37:08.310 --> 00:37:08.320 align:start position:0%
years will soon be at the 6800 to have
 
00:37:11.829 --> 00:37:11.839 align:start position:0%
two reps we don't even have one
 
00:37:14.470 --> 00:37:14.480 align:start position:0%
all right we share one with newcastle
 
00:37:16.310 --> 00:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
now newcastle's rebecca can probably
 
00:37:18.310 --> 00:37:18.320 align:start position:0%
tell you here's the santa cable perkins
 
00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:19.190 align:start position:0%
tell you here's the santa cable perkins
that

00:37:19.190 --> 00:37:19.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:22.480 align:start position:0%
parking style that that newcastle
 
00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
probably is a lot more in common with
 
00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
the southern end of portsmouth
 
00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:26.480 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:37:28.150 --> 00:37:28.160 align:start position:0%
we probably have more in common with
 
00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:30.640 align:start position:0%
northampton but northampton's extra
 
00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:32.240 align:start position:0%
people got thrown in one of those
 
00:37:33.910 --> 00:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
fertility districts with four or five
 
00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
other districts so there's another
 
00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:38.560 align:start position:0%
example that can be happening
 
00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:40.150 align:start position:0%
example that can be happening
now

00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:40.160 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
i don't really like either party to be
 
00:37:44.230 --> 00:37:44.240 align:start position:0%
honest with you i spend a lot of my time
 
00:37:45.430 --> 00:37:45.440 align:start position:0%
trying to fix
 
00:37:47.990 --> 00:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
democracy if you look around
 
00:37:49.750 --> 00:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
i don't see a lot of younger people here
 
00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
do you
 
00:37:52.950 --> 00:37:52.960 align:start position:0%
you ever wonder why
 
00:37:54.470 --> 00:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
why they don't participate why they
 
00:37:55.990 --> 00:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
don't get involved
 
00:37:57.750 --> 00:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
now i think a good example is i don't
 
00:37:57.760 --> 00:37:58.870 align:start position:0%
now i think a good example is i don't
know

00:37:58.870 --> 00:37:58.880 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:38:01.589 --> 00:38:01.599 align:start position:0%
um if any 20 something's ever said okay
 
00:38:03.349 --> 00:38:03.359 align:start position:0%
boomer do you
 
00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:04.880 align:start position:0%
do you know what really if you ever talk
 
00:38:06.310 --> 00:38:06.320 align:start position:0%
to them and ask them what that really is
 
00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:07.670 align:start position:0%
to them and ask them what that really is
about

00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:09.520 align:start position:0%
mr bourne just keep in mind we have a
 
00:38:10.950 --> 00:38:10.960 align:start position:0%
number of people signed up to speak
 
00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
tonight and this is about the
 
00:38:16.069 --> 00:38:16.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
so what they mean by that is that
 
00:38:21.109 --> 00:38:21.119 align:start position:0%
when we're talking down at them and
 
00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:23.200 align:start position:0%
looking back at us and saying
 
00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
who are you to tell me what to do
 
00:38:27.430 --> 00:38:27.440 align:start position:0%
forget about climate change look at
 
00:38:29.589 --> 00:38:29.599 align:start position:0%
democracy it's a mess
 
00:38:31.990 --> 00:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
you guys have made a mockery of it it's
 
00:38:35.270 --> 00:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
a money-driven process the the political
 
00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:36.069 align:start position:0%
a money-driven process the the political
the

00:38:36.069 --> 00:38:36.079 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
party primaries 30 somebody could win
 
00:38:40.470 --> 00:38:40.480 align:start position:0%
with 30 of the votes 70 percent of the
 
00:38:42.069 --> 00:38:42.079 align:start position:0%
people will prep for someone else we
 
00:38:44.069 --> 00:38:44.079 align:start position:0%
have to pick between the two people and
 
00:38:47.430 --> 00:38:47.440 align:start position:0%
then we've got gary mandarin right and
 
00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:49.440 align:start position:0%
and no wonder why they they're checked
 
00:38:51.510 --> 00:38:51.520 align:start position:0%
out they don't want people now is our
 
00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:52.950 align:start position:0%
out they don't want people now is our
opportunity

00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:52.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
00:38:54.630 --> 00:38:54.640 align:start position:0%
to make some difference it took a long
 
00:38:56.069 --> 00:38:56.079 align:start position:0%
time for everything to get this messed
 
00:38:58.150 --> 00:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
up but we can make you have the
 
00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:00.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity now to put things in the
 
00:39:01.910 --> 00:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
right direction
 
00:39:04.150 --> 00:39:04.160 align:start position:0%
all right if the job's done right and
 
00:39:06.069 --> 00:39:06.079 align:start position:0%
what the citizens want there won't be a
 
00:39:09.349 --> 00:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
single sniff iota of gerrymandering that
 
00:39:11.109 --> 00:39:11.119 align:start position:0%
should be the goal you should look at
 
00:39:13.109 --> 00:39:13.119 align:start position:0%
those maps and no one should question or
 
00:39:14.550 --> 00:39:14.560 align:start position:0%
even doubt that there's any
 
00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:16.400 align:start position:0%
garrymandering that happened to
 
00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:18.640 align:start position:0%
hampshire that's what the people want
 
00:39:20.790 --> 00:39:20.800 align:start position:0%
that's a step to take to try to make our
 
00:39:23.829 --> 00:39:23.839 align:start position:0%
democracy work better thank you

thank you for clarifying yes sir

so i want to address something that can
 
00:40:24.950 --> 00:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
happen and does happen when towns
 
00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:26.640 align:start position:0%

up until
 
00:40:38.790 --> 00:40:38.800 align:start position:0%
up until 2002
 
00:40:41.430 --> 00:40:41.440 align:start position:0%
deerfield had its own house district and
 
00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:44.560 align:start position:0%
its own state representative
 
00:40:48.790 --> 00:40:48.800 align:start position:0%
he or she was a resident of deerfield
 
00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:51.200 align:start position:0%
he knew deerfield well
 
00:40:52.470 --> 00:40:52.480 align:start position:0%
he understood
 
00:40:55.349 --> 00:40:55.359 align:start position:0%
the issues that were affecting our town
 
00:40:57.589 --> 00:40:57.599 align:start position:0%
and he was an active contributor to the
 
00:40:57.599 --> 00:40:59.430 align:start position:0%
and he was an active contributor to the
community

00:40:59.430 --> 00:40:59.440 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
he was well respected
 
00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
and different
 
00:41:06.069 --> 00:41:06.079 align:start position:0%
he was chosen by the people of deerfield
 
00:41:08.550 --> 00:41:08.560 align:start position:0%
to be their representative
 
00:41:12.309 --> 00:41:12.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:14.790 --> 00:41:14.800 align:start position:0%
that is no longer the case
 
00:41:16.950 --> 00:41:16.960 align:start position:0%
since 2002
 
00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
our state representatives have been
 
00:41:21.670 --> 00:41:21.680 align:start position:0%
chosen by the majorities in our
 
00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:23.510 align:start position:0%
chosen by the majorities in our
multi-district

00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
multi-district
 
00:41:26.390 --> 00:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
multi-town district
 
00:41:28.790 --> 00:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
not necessarily by a majority of
 
00:41:30.870 --> 00:41:30.880 align:start position:0%
deerfield residents
 
00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
for example
 
00:41:36.069 --> 00:41:36.079 align:start position:0%
we have had individuals run repeatedly
 
00:41:38.550 --> 00:41:38.560 align:start position:0%
for deerfield town offices
 
00:41:40.870 --> 00:41:40.880 align:start position:0%
such as school board
 
00:41:42.550 --> 00:41:42.560 align:start position:0%
select board
 
00:41:44.550 --> 00:41:44.560 align:start position:0%
and each time
 
00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
these individuals have lost
 
00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
those elections
 
00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
they are well known in town and they are
 
00:41:55.510 --> 00:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
not elected to these positions
 
00:41:58.950 --> 00:41:58.960 align:start position:0%
and yet these same individuals go on to
 
00:42:02.790 --> 00:42:02.800 align:start position:0%
become our state representatives
 
00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:04.150 align:start position:0%
become our state representatives
why

00:42:04.150 --> 00:42:04.160 align:start position:0%
why
 
00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:06.720 align:start position:0%
because they are not known in the other
 
00:42:09.589 --> 00:42:09.599 align:start position:0%
towns in our district
 
00:42:12.069 --> 00:42:12.079 align:start position:0%
they are elected based sold on their
 
00:42:12.079 --> 00:42:13.589 align:start position:0%
they are elected based sold on their
party

00:42:13.589 --> 00:42:13.599 align:start position:0%
party
 
00:42:16.470 --> 00:42:16.480 align:start position:0%
rather than their accomplishments or
 
00:42:20.710 --> 00:42:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:23.109 --> 00:42:23.119 align:start position:0%
this is not right
 
00:42:28.870 --> 00:42:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
it is time to return to our town of
 
00:42:33.829 --> 00:42:33.839 align:start position:0%

issue that i have a concern for um i
 
00:45:56.309 --> 00:45:56.319 align:start position:0%

00:45:58.870 --> 00:45:58.880 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:46:02.069 --> 00:46:02.079 align:start position:0%
we select three people from district two
 
00:46:03.270 --> 00:46:03.280 align:start position:0%

00:46:06.390 --> 00:46:06.400 align:start position:0%

00:46:19.030 --> 00:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
one lives and not encampment so as other
 
00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
speakers have um already stated um i
 
00:46:23.910 --> 00:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
think it would be very beneficial to
 
00:46:26.470 --> 00:46:26.480 align:start position:0%
candia to have a representative um in
 
00:46:28.390 --> 00:46:28.400 align:start position:0%
the house of representatives
 
00:46:30.390 --> 00:46:30.400 align:start position:0%
and and reflecting on this i guess just
 
00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:31.270 align:start position:0%
and and reflecting on this i guess just
one

00:46:31.270 --> 00:46:31.280 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:46:34.230 --> 00:46:34.240 align:start position:0%
comment i would make um sort of from my
 
00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:36.640 align:start position:0%
own point of view and maybe an editorial
 
00:46:38.390 --> 00:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
perspective is
 
00:46:41.190 --> 00:46:41.200 align:start position:0%
we have too much partisanship and if i
 
00:46:43.829 --> 00:46:43.839 align:start position:0%
were to vote from someone from canadia i
 
00:46:46.150 --> 00:46:46.160 align:start position:0%
wouldn't really be considering
 
00:46:48.390 --> 00:46:48.400 align:start position:0%
and maybe i should but is this person a
 
00:46:50.150 --> 00:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
republican or a democrat i would be
 
00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:51.190 align:start position:0%
republican or a democrat i would be
saying

00:46:51.190 --> 00:46:51.200 align:start position:0%
saying
 
00:46:53.190 --> 00:46:53.200 align:start position:0%
has this person been a selectmen has
 
00:46:55.750 --> 00:46:55.760 align:start position:0%
this person worked at the polls
 
00:46:58.069 --> 00:46:58.079 align:start position:0%
what has this person done to contribute
 
00:46:59.589 --> 00:46:59.599 align:start position:0%
to this
 
00:47:01.510 --> 00:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the town
 
00:47:04.550 --> 00:47:04.560 align:start position:0%

00:47:09.430 --> 00:47:09.440 align:start position:0%

because i feel that senator script 23
 
00:47:40.549 --> 00:47:40.559 align:start position:0%
fails to properly represent me due to a
 
00:47:43.589 --> 00:47:43.599 align:start position:0%
partisan advantage for republicans in my
 
00:47:46.390 --> 00:47:46.400 align:start position:0%
district this scary mandarin is subtle
 
00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
but significant
 
00:47:50.470 --> 00:47:50.480 align:start position:0%
since we are in the process of
 
00:47:52.630 --> 00:47:52.640 align:start position:0%
redistricting i'd like to see the new
 
00:47:54.630 --> 00:47:54.640 align:start position:0%
legislative lines
 
00:47:57.430 --> 00:47:57.440 align:start position:0%
drawn in a non-partisan way instead of
 
00:48:00.390 --> 00:48:00.400 align:start position:0%
continuing to favor republicans
 
00:48:02.710 --> 00:48:02.720 align:start position:0%
the process that i've noticed goes like
 
00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:03.829 align:start position:0%
the process that i've noticed goes like
this

00:48:03.829 --> 00:48:03.839 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:48:06.150 --> 00:48:06.160 align:start position:0%
my district has been designed so that
 
00:48:08.549 --> 00:48:08.559 align:start position:0%
the number of democrats in the district
 
00:48:11.109 --> 00:48:11.119 align:start position:0%
are just enough to almost but not quite
 
00:48:12.470 --> 00:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
win elections
 
00:48:15.430 --> 00:48:15.440 align:start position:0%
as a result for instance in the 2020
 
00:48:18.390 --> 00:48:18.400 align:start position:0%
election the large number of democratic
 
00:48:20.790 --> 00:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
votes including my own have been
 
00:48:22.950 --> 00:48:22.960 align:start position:0%
essentially wasted because our votes
 
00:48:25.510 --> 00:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
have not been converted into seats
 
00:48:28.150 --> 00:48:28.160 align:start position:0%
in a 2016 article
 
00:48:30.950 --> 00:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
new hampshire public radio describes
 
00:48:33.750 --> 00:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
their election research when one party
 
00:48:36.790 --> 00:48:36.800 align:start position:0%
consistently loses by thin margins an
 
00:48:40.069 --> 00:48:40.079 align:start position:0%
efficiency gap that calculates wasted
 
00:48:42.069 --> 00:48:42.079 align:start position:0%
votes develops
 
00:48:44.309 --> 00:48:44.319 align:start position:0%
diluting the democratic votes this way
 
00:48:46.950 --> 00:48:46.960 align:start position:0%
makes my districts and others less
 
00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:48.390 align:start position:0%
makes my districts and others less
competitive

00:48:48.390 --> 00:48:48.400 align:start position:0%
competitive
 
00:48:50.950 --> 00:48:50.960 align:start position:0%
my voice and those of other democrats
 
00:48:53.670 --> 00:48:53.680 align:start position:0%
have not been represented and conquered
 
00:48:55.670 --> 00:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
by the republicans who have been elected
 
00:48:57.109 --> 00:48:57.119 align:start position:0%
in the past
 
00:48:59.349 --> 00:48:59.359 align:start position:0%
when this process happens across many
 
00:49:02.630 --> 00:49:02.640 align:start position:0%
districts the partisan disadvantages for
 
00:49:05.349 --> 00:49:05.359 align:start position:0%
democrats multiplies resulting in huge
 
00:49:07.829 --> 00:49:07.839 align:start position:0%
numbers of democrats losing proper
 
00:49:10.150 --> 00:49:10.160 align:start position:0%
representation in concord
 
00:49:13.190 --> 00:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
now is the time to write this sprawn
 
00:49:15.270 --> 00:49:15.280 align:start position:0%
it is the time to redistrict in a
 
00:49:18.390 --> 00:49:18.400 align:start position:0%
non-partisan way
 
00:49:21.109 --> 00:49:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:31.750 --> 00:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair senators
 
00:49:35.109 --> 00:49:35.119 align:start position:0%
uh i'd like to i'm uh
 
00:49:39.750 --> 00:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
a state bro state rep in uh district 13
 
00:49:42.549 --> 00:49:42.559 align:start position:0%
and i'm also a selectmen in hampstead
 
00:49:44.870 --> 00:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
and just like the uh just a little input
 
00:49:47.109 --> 00:49:47.119 align:start position:0%
from uh as far as
 
00:49:50.150 --> 00:49:50.160 align:start position:0%
the town of hampton is concerned we are
 
00:49:52.950 --> 00:49:52.960 align:start position:0%
uh in a district with kingston
 
00:49:55.030 --> 00:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
and we have four reps
 
00:49:57.430 --> 00:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
and we bend over backwards as a
 
00:49:57.440 --> 00:49:58.870 align:start position:0%
and we bend over backwards as a
community

00:49:58.870 --> 00:49:58.880 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:50:02.230 --> 00:50:02.240 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we can have two
 
00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:03.109 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we can have two
from

00:50:03.109 --> 00:50:03.119 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:50:05.589 --> 00:50:05.599 align:start position:0%
kingston and two from
 
00:50:07.750 --> 00:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
hampstead and
 
00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:09.750 align:start position:0%
hampstead and
so

00:50:09.750 --> 00:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:50:11.030 --> 00:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
even though
 
00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
both towns have increased in population
 
00:50:16.230 --> 00:50:16.240 align:start position:0%
we're all pushing 9000 each
 
00:50:18.390 --> 00:50:18.400 align:start position:0%
uh and uh
 
00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
that may give you some hot cheddar when
 
00:50:22.230 --> 00:50:22.240 align:start position:0%
you start to uh
 
00:50:24.470 --> 00:50:24.480 align:start position:0%
set up the districts but
 
00:50:26.390 --> 00:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
i just like and then i would also like
 
00:50:28.710 --> 00:50:28.720 align:start position:0%
to say that in my opinion and i've i
 
00:50:31.910 --> 00:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
served on this committee back in the 90s
 
00:50:33.510 --> 00:50:33.520 align:start position:0%
and it was done a little bit different i
 
00:50:36.150 --> 00:50:36.160 align:start position:0%
like to complement the commission took
 
00:50:38.630 --> 00:50:38.640 align:start position:0%
for the openness
 
00:50:41.109 --> 00:50:41.119 align:start position:0%
of the process now the
 
00:50:43.349 --> 00:50:43.359 align:start position:0%
the uh going to each one of the counties
 
00:50:46.470 --> 00:50:46.480 align:start position:0%
i think that's great the uh uh using the
 
00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:47.349 align:start position:0%
i think that's great the uh uh using the
uh

00:50:47.349 --> 00:50:47.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:50:47.359 --> 00:50:48.470 align:start position:0%
uh
uh

00:50:48.470 --> 00:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:50:50.950 --> 00:50:50.960 align:start position:0%
the uh where will all we have to get our
 
00:50:53.030 --> 00:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
message across is great
 
00:50:55.270 --> 00:50:55.280 align:start position:0%
uh so all those things are good and i
 
00:50:57.270 --> 00:50:57.280 align:start position:0%
think that's important because today
 
00:51:00.330 --> 00:51:00.340 align:start position:0%
we're talking about transfer
 
00:51:00.340 --> 00:51:02.069 align:start position:0%
we're talking about transfer
[Music]

00:51:02.069 --> 00:51:02.079 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:51:02.079 --> 00:51:03.109 align:start position:0%
[Music]
being

00:51:03.109 --> 00:51:03.119 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:51:05.829 --> 00:51:05.839 align:start position:0%
open and above when we're doing our
 
00:51:09.270 --> 00:51:09.280 align:start position:0%
business and i suggest that
 
00:51:11.190 --> 00:51:11.200 align:start position:0%
that's probably the most important thing
 
00:51:13.750 --> 00:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
we have to concern ourselves with every
 
00:51:17.750 --> 00:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
10 years that is that we're transparent
 
00:51:20.150 --> 00:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
and i would suggest to you
 
00:51:22.630 --> 00:51:22.640 align:start position:0%
that because of the process
 
00:51:25.030 --> 00:51:25.040 align:start position:0%
uh it's very difficult to be more
 
00:51:27.430 --> 00:51:27.440 align:start position:0%
transparent than you already are
 
00:51:29.510 --> 00:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
but i think that every effort should be
 
00:51:31.750 --> 00:51:31.760 align:start position:0%
made to be transparent
 
00:51:35.270 --> 00:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
uh the other thing i think is a concern
 
00:51:39.349 --> 00:51:39.359 align:start position:0%
i think you're set up to fail
 
00:51:41.589 --> 00:51:41.599 align:start position:0%
the guidelines and the goals that you
 
00:51:44.870 --> 00:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
have in redistricting sets you up in the
 
00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
house side to fail
 
00:51:51.270 --> 00:51:51.280 align:start position:0%
you you cannot do your job
 
00:51:54.390 --> 00:51:54.400 align:start position:0%
without failing some communities it's
 
00:51:56.390 --> 00:51:56.400 align:start position:0%
just the way it is we talked about
 
00:51:56.400 --> 00:51:58.069 align:start position:0%
just the way it is we talked about
gerrymandering

00:51:58.069 --> 00:51:58.079 align:start position:0%
gerrymandering
 
00:51:59.829 --> 00:51:59.839 align:start position:0%
now that's a nice word it came from
 
00:52:01.670 --> 00:52:01.680 align:start position:0%
massachusetts where i come from
 
00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:02.950 align:start position:0%
massachusetts where i come from
originally

00:52:02.950 --> 00:52:02.960 align:start position:0%
originally
 
00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
but what is german gerrymandering
 
00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:06.710 align:start position:0%
but what is german gerrymandering
assumes

00:52:06.710 --> 00:52:06.720 align:start position:0%
assumes
 
00:52:08.470 --> 00:52:08.480 align:start position:0%
that you're making
 
00:52:12.309 --> 00:52:12.319 align:start position:0%
decisions based on strictly politics and
 
00:52:15.589 --> 00:52:15.599 align:start position:0%
i submit to you that that's not the case
 
00:52:17.109 --> 00:52:17.119 align:start position:0%
i know most of the members on this
 
00:52:19.589 --> 00:52:19.599 align:start position:0%
committee and i know that there's enough
 
00:52:21.990 --> 00:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
strong votes on both sides
 
00:52:23.829 --> 00:52:23.839 align:start position:0%
that make sure that
 
00:52:23.839 --> 00:52:24.630 align:start position:0%
that make sure that
the

00:52:24.630 --> 00:52:24.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:26.630 align:start position:0%
the
real

00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:26.640 align:start position:0%
real
 
00:52:29.109 --> 00:52:29.119 align:start position:0%
gerrymandering is never done
 
00:52:29.119 --> 00:52:29.910 align:start position:0%
gerrymandering is never done
but

00:52:29.910 --> 00:52:29.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:31.270 align:start position:0%
but
it

00:52:31.270 --> 00:52:31.280 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:52:32.950 --> 00:52:32.960 align:start position:0%
the impression is that it's
 
00:52:34.950 --> 00:52:34.960 align:start position:0%
gerrymandering because of the rules and
 
00:52:36.950 --> 00:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
regulations you have
 
00:52:38.950 --> 00:52:38.960 align:start position:0%
and i would suggest that unless you
 
00:52:40.870 --> 00:52:40.880 align:start position:0%
change those rules
 
00:52:42.950 --> 00:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
that's going to continue
 
00:52:48.630 --> 00:52:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:50.950 --> 00:52:50.960 align:start position:0%
in order to make the
 
00:52:53.190 --> 00:52:53.200 align:start position:0%
system more transparent and more
 
00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:54.309 align:start position:0%
system more transparent and more
comfortable

00:52:54.309 --> 00:52:54.319 align:start position:0%
comfortable
 
00:52:56.950 --> 00:52:56.960 align:start position:0%
that we take a real hard look at what's
 
00:52:59.349 --> 00:52:59.359 align:start position:0%
being proposed in many
 
00:53:02.470 --> 00:53:02.480 align:start position:0%
uh areas and that is that we change the
 
00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:03.510 align:start position:0%
uh areas and that is that we change the
makeup

00:53:03.510 --> 00:53:03.520 align:start position:0%
makeup
 
00:53:05.030 --> 00:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
of your commission
 
00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
unless we change the
 
00:53:08.950 --> 00:53:08.960 align:start position:0%
nature of your commission
 
00:53:11.670 --> 00:53:11.680 align:start position:0%
or change the rules and the rules are
 
00:53:13.270 --> 00:53:13.280 align:start position:0%
harder to change
 
00:53:15.270 --> 00:53:15.280 align:start position:0%
i think we're going to continue to do
 
00:53:18.470 --> 00:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
this and i commend you for doing the job
 
00:53:20.230 --> 00:53:20.240 align:start position:0%
with the uh
 
00:53:22.309 --> 00:53:22.319 align:start position:0%
chance that you it's just going to be
 
00:53:24.790 --> 00:53:24.800 align:start position:0%
impossible for you to
 
00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
make everybody
 
00:53:29.589 --> 00:53:29.599 align:start position:0%
happy and i uh
 
00:53:32.150 --> 00:53:32.160 align:start position:0%
hope that if uh if there's anything you
 
00:53:33.190 --> 00:53:33.200 align:start position:0%
can do
 
00:53:35.670 --> 00:53:35.680 align:start position:0%
uh particularly in supporting because i
 
00:53:37.510 --> 00:53:37.520 align:start position:0%
think it's bipartisan
 
00:53:39.589 --> 00:53:39.599 align:start position:0%
supporting the concept that we change
 
00:53:40.790 --> 00:53:40.800 align:start position:0%
the commission
 
00:53:43.030 --> 00:53:43.040 align:start position:0%
that we have an equal republican the
 
00:53:44.630 --> 00:53:44.640 align:start position:0%
equal democrat
 
00:53:47.670 --> 00:53:47.680 align:start position:0%
uh and probably with an unequal uh
 
00:53:50.069 --> 00:53:50.079 align:start position:0%
citizen participation that's being
 
00:53:52.790 --> 00:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
advocated that that's the answer to
 
00:53:55.109 --> 00:53:55.119 align:start position:0%
solve some of the problems we're done
 
00:53:57.270 --> 00:53:57.280 align:start position:0%
tonight thank you
 
00:53:59.829 --> 00:53:59.839 align:start position:0%
thank you next signed up i have chris
 
00:54:10.390 --> 00:54:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:12.069 --> 00:54:12.079 align:start position:0%
madam chairman and members of the
 
00:54:12.079 --> 00:54:13.190 align:start position:0%
madam chairman and members of the
committee

00:54:13.190 --> 00:54:13.200 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:54:15.589 --> 00:54:15.599 align:start position:0%
my name is chris muns i served as a
 
00:54:17.030 --> 00:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
state representative representing
 
00:54:18.549 --> 00:54:18.559 align:start position:0%
hampton between
 
00:54:20.630 --> 00:54:20.640 align:start position:0%
2012 and 2014.
 
00:54:22.309 --> 00:54:22.319 align:start position:0%
i was also a candidate for the state
 
00:54:24.790 --> 00:54:24.800 align:start position:0%
senate in district 24.
 
00:54:26.790 --> 00:54:26.800 align:start position:0%
i know what a commitment of time and
 
00:54:28.870 --> 00:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
energy uh this is for you and i'd like
 
00:54:31.990 --> 00:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
to thank you all for your service
 
00:54:34.630 --> 00:54:34.640 align:start position:0%
there's nothing more central to our
 
00:54:36.789 --> 00:54:36.799 align:start position:0%
representative democracy than voters
 
00:54:39.109 --> 00:54:39.119 align:start position:0%
believing the prop process they must
 
00:54:41.349 --> 00:54:41.359 align:start position:0%
follow to elect their representatives is
 
00:54:43.910 --> 00:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
transparent and fair
 
00:54:45.349 --> 00:54:45.359 align:start position:0%
to that end i thank you for the
 
00:54:47.030 --> 00:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity you are giving individuals
 
00:54:48.710 --> 00:54:48.720 align:start position:0%
throughout new hampshire to share their
 
00:54:50.470 --> 00:54:50.480 align:start position:0%
input with you
 
00:54:52.150 --> 00:54:52.160 align:start position:0%
i hope the decisions you make will
 
00:54:55.349 --> 00:54:55.359 align:start position:0%
reflect the input you have received
 
00:54:57.589 --> 00:54:57.599 align:start position:0%
it is unfortunate however
 
00:54:59.510 --> 00:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
that given the recent increases in coven
 
00:55:01.750 --> 00:55:01.760 align:start position:0%
cases across the state you chose not to
 
00:55:03.430 --> 00:55:03.440 align:start position:0%
provide an option for the public to
 
00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:04.829 align:start position:0%
provide an option for the public to
testify

00:55:04.829 --> 00:55:04.839 align:start position:0%
testify
 
00:55:07.430 --> 00:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
remotely i urge you to reconsider that
 
00:55:09.589 --> 00:55:09.599 align:start position:0%
decision and to add that flexibility to
 
00:55:11.829 --> 00:55:11.839 align:start position:0%
the remaining listing sessions you have
 
00:55:11.839 --> 00:55:13.829 align:start position:0%
the remaining listing sessions you have
scheduled

00:55:13.829 --> 00:55:13.839 align:start position:0%
scheduled
 
00:55:15.589 --> 00:55:15.599 align:start position:0%
in light of the comments made by the
 
00:55:17.270 --> 00:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
chairman of the new hampshire republican
 
00:55:19.750 --> 00:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
party that maps will be manipulated so
 
00:55:22.069 --> 00:55:22.079 align:start position:0%
as to favor his party
 
00:55:23.670 --> 00:55:23.680 align:start position:0%
it is essential that you not only
 
00:55:26.230 --> 00:55:26.240 align:start position:0%
renounce those statements but that you
 
00:55:27.750 --> 00:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
commit to holding another round of
 
00:55:31.030 --> 00:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
hearings after the maps are drawn
 
00:55:33.270 --> 00:55:33.280 align:start position:0%
so that the public has a chance to
 
00:55:35.750 --> 00:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
provide you with their input and so that
 
00:55:37.990 --> 00:55:38.000 align:start position:0%
you can demonstrate that the process
 
00:55:42.069 --> 00:55:42.079 align:start position:0%
used to draw those maps was indeed fair
 
00:55:43.589 --> 00:55:43.599 align:start position:0%
to give the public enough time to
 
00:55:45.750 --> 00:55:45.760 align:start position:0%
provide you with meaningful input the
 
00:55:47.829 --> 00:55:47.839 align:start position:0%
public needs at least 10 days notice of
 
00:55:50.710 --> 00:55:50.720 align:start position:0%
all future public hearings
 
00:55:53.349 --> 00:55:53.359 align:start position:0%
the two best litmus tests of whether the
 
00:55:55.430 --> 00:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
process is fair
 
00:55:57.270 --> 00:55:57.280 align:start position:0%
will be what you decide to do with our
 
00:55:59.190 --> 00:55:59.200 align:start position:0%
two congressional districts
 
00:56:02.710 --> 00:56:02.720 align:start position:0%
and five executive council districts
 
00:56:04.230 --> 00:56:04.240 align:start position:0%
there have been minimal changes in
 
00:56:06.069 --> 00:56:06.079 align:start position:0%
population between the existing
 
00:56:09.510 --> 00:56:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:11.030 --> 00:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
and the changes to the maps of those
 
00:56:13.430 --> 00:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
districts should be very minimal
 
00:56:15.910 --> 00:56:15.920 align:start position:0%
it will be telling however if you adopt
 
00:56:18.150 --> 00:56:18.160 align:start position:0%
a map that either bisects manchester or
 
00:56:19.829 --> 00:56:19.839 align:start position:0%
proposes to move it from congressional
 
00:56:23.190 --> 00:56:23.200 align:start position:0%
district 1 to congressional district 2.
 
00:56:24.870 --> 00:56:24.880 align:start position:0%
executive council district 2 is
 
00:56:26.789 --> 00:56:26.799 align:start position:0%
currently one of the best examples of
 
00:56:29.670 --> 00:56:29.680 align:start position:0%
gerrymandering anywhere in the country
 
00:56:31.349 --> 00:56:31.359 align:start position:0%
it and the other executive council
 
00:56:32.870 --> 00:56:32.880 align:start position:0%
districts need to be
 
00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:33.990 align:start position:0%
districts need to be
redrawn

00:56:33.990 --> 00:56:34.000 align:start position:0%
redrawn
 
00:56:35.589 --> 00:56:35.599 align:start position:0%
so that they better represent
 
00:56:38.470 --> 00:56:38.480 align:start position:0%
communities of sheer interest and the
 
00:56:40.150 --> 00:56:40.160 align:start position:0%
partisan balance that exists within the
 
00:56:40.160 --> 00:56:41.349 align:start position:0%
partisan balance that exists within the
state

00:56:41.349 --> 00:56:41.359 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:56:43.270 --> 00:56:43.280 align:start position:0%
failure to do so will cast doubt on the
 
00:56:45.910 --> 00:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
whole redistricting process
 
00:56:47.910 --> 00:56:47.920 align:start position:0%
that same principle grouping communities
 
00:56:49.190 --> 00:56:49.200 align:start position:0%
together who have shared interests
 
00:56:51.030 --> 00:56:51.040 align:start position:0%
should guide how senate state senate
 
00:56:53.270 --> 00:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
districts are drawn
 
00:56:55.510 --> 00:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
in district 24 for example
 
00:56:58.230 --> 00:56:58.240 align:start position:0%
newton has more in common with plasto
 
00:57:00.230 --> 00:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
currently in district 22
 
00:57:02.230 --> 00:57:02.240 align:start position:0%
than it does with newcastle
 
00:57:04.069 --> 00:57:04.079 align:start position:0%
which has much more in common with
 
00:57:05.910 --> 00:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
portsmouth which is currently in
 
00:57:07.829 --> 00:57:07.839 align:start position:0%
district 21.
 
00:57:10.069 --> 00:57:10.079 align:start position:0%
you need to end the practice of creating
 
00:57:12.230 --> 00:57:12.240 align:start position:0%
safe republican and safe democratic
 
00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:14.150 align:start position:0%
safe republican and safe democratic
districts

00:57:14.150 --> 00:57:14.160 align:start position:0%
districts
 
00:57:16.230 --> 00:57:16.240 align:start position:0%
wherever possible every town with more
 
00:57:18.230 --> 00:57:18.240 align:start position:0%
than 3 500 residents should have at
 
00:57:20.230 --> 00:57:20.240 align:start position:0%
least one state representative
 
00:57:22.069 --> 00:57:22.079 align:start position:0%
representative representing just that
 
00:57:24.390 --> 00:57:24.400 align:start position:0%
town and we should minimize the number
 
00:57:26.789 --> 00:57:26.799 align:start position:0%
of floateral districts
 
00:57:29.190 --> 00:57:29.200 align:start position:0%
where a floaterial district is necessary
 
00:57:30.870 --> 00:57:30.880 align:start position:0%
the principle of grouping communities
 
00:57:32.390 --> 00:57:32.400 align:start position:0%
with shared interest should be followed
 
00:57:34.069 --> 00:57:34.079 align:start position:0%
there as well
 
00:57:36.230 --> 00:57:36.240 align:start position:0%
hampton falls which currently shares
 
00:57:38.630 --> 00:57:38.640 align:start position:0%
three seats with seabrook has less in
 
00:57:40.470 --> 00:57:40.480 align:start position:0%
common with seabrook than for example
 
00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:42.069 align:start position:0%
common with seabrook than for example
kensington

00:57:42.069 --> 00:57:42.079 align:start position:0%
kensington
 
00:57:43.990 --> 00:57:44.000 align:start position:0%
and northampton which currently shares a
 
00:57:46.069 --> 00:57:46.079 align:start position:0%
seat with newington and portsmouth has
 
00:57:48.150 --> 00:57:48.160 align:start position:0%
less in common with those two towns than
 
00:57:51.030 --> 00:57:51.040 align:start position:0%
it does greenland or strata
 
00:57:53.190 --> 00:57:53.200 align:start position:0%
finally as a former state representative
 
00:57:55.190 --> 00:57:55.200 align:start position:0%
from hampton i would be remiss if i did
 
00:57:56.230 --> 00:57:56.240 align:start position:0%
not say
 
00:57:59.109 --> 00:57:59.119 align:start position:0%
that as a that as a town with almost 16
 
00:58:00.470 --> 00:58:00.480 align:start position:0%
000 people
 
00:58:02.630 --> 00:58:02.640 align:start position:0%
we should have at least four state
 
00:58:04.470 --> 00:58:04.480 align:start position:0%
representatives representatives
 
00:58:07.109 --> 00:58:07.119 align:start position:0%
representing just hampton
 
00:58:08.470 --> 00:58:08.480 align:start position:0%
thank you again for your time this
 
00:58:11.190 --> 00:58:11.200 align:start position:0%
evening and thank you for your service
 
00:58:14.549 --> 00:58:14.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:25.910 --> 00:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:27.510 --> 00:58:27.520 align:start position:0%
i apologize i think i probably
 
00:58:29.190 --> 00:58:29.200 align:start position:0%
mispronounced your last name it can be
 
00:58:32.010 --> 00:58:32.020 align:start position:0%
pronounced a dozen different ways
 
00:58:32.020 --> 00:58:34.390 align:start position:0%
pronounced a dozen different ways
[Music]

00:58:34.390 --> 00:58:34.400 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:58:35.829 --> 00:58:35.839 align:start position:0%
thank you first of all for giving me the
 
00:58:37.349 --> 00:58:37.359 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak
 
00:58:39.190 --> 00:58:39.200 align:start position:0%
i've been sitting back there and my
 
00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:40.069 align:start position:0%
i've been sitting back there and my
opening

00:58:40.069 --> 00:58:40.079 align:start position:0%
opening
 
00:58:41.829 --> 00:58:41.839 align:start position:0%
has probably changed a half a dozen
 
00:58:41.839 --> 00:58:43.030 align:start position:0%
has probably changed a half a dozen
times

00:58:43.030 --> 00:58:43.040 align:start position:0%
times
 
00:58:46.230 --> 00:58:46.240 align:start position:0%
but it always comes back to one thing
 
00:58:48.829 --> 00:58:48.839 align:start position:0%
this would not be my preferred method of
 
00:58:50.549 --> 00:58:50.559 align:start position:0%
redistricting i would have an
 
00:58:52.230 --> 00:58:52.240 align:start position:0%
independent body
 
00:58:54.150 --> 00:58:54.160 align:start position:0%
made up that i would follow along with
 
00:58:55.910 --> 00:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
mr guthrie said
 
00:58:57.750 --> 00:58:57.760 align:start position:0%
of an equal number of democrats and
 
00:59:00.150 --> 00:59:00.160 align:start position:0%
republicans and
 
00:59:00.160 --> 00:59:01.510 align:start position:0%
republicans and
augmented

00:59:01.510 --> 00:59:01.520 align:start position:0%
augmented
 
00:59:03.349 --> 00:59:03.359 align:start position:0%
by a group of citizens because you need
 
00:59:05.190 --> 00:59:05.200 align:start position:0%
an odd number in order to get a majority
 
00:59:07.190 --> 00:59:07.200 align:start position:0%
of one side or the other
 
00:59:09.109 --> 00:59:09.119 align:start position:0%
i don't know any of you except for
 
00:59:11.109 --> 00:59:11.119 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron
 
00:59:11.119 --> 00:59:12.150 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron
um

00:59:12.150 --> 00:59:12.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:13.270 --> 00:59:13.280 align:start position:0%
i'm going to assume you're all
 
00:59:15.829 --> 00:59:15.839 align:start position:0%
fair-minded people
 
00:59:17.109 --> 00:59:17.119 align:start position:0%
but i've been living in rockingham
 
00:59:19.910 --> 00:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
county for more than 40 years and i know
 
00:59:21.910 --> 00:59:21.920 align:start position:0%
some reps who are anything but
 
00:59:23.829 --> 00:59:23.839 align:start position:0%
fair-minded and that's the people i'm
 
00:59:26.069 --> 00:59:26.079 align:start position:0%
afraid of
 
00:59:28.950 --> 00:59:28.960 align:start position:0%
we can talk all we want about
 
00:59:31.190 --> 00:59:31.200 align:start position:0%
the criteria in fact i'm not an expert
 
00:59:32.950 --> 00:59:32.960 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure there is any expert on
 
00:59:32.960 --> 00:59:34.309 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure there is any expert on
redistricting

00:59:34.309 --> 00:59:34.319 align:start position:0%
redistricting
 
00:59:36.470 --> 00:59:36.480 align:start position:0%
because there are so many criteria to go
 
00:59:38.549 --> 00:59:38.559 align:start position:0%
into it it's like peeling an onion
 
00:59:40.150 --> 00:59:40.160 align:start position:0%
but the gentleman just spoke before me
 
00:59:42.150 --> 00:59:42.160 align:start position:0%
about this town having something in
 
00:59:43.990 --> 00:59:44.000 align:start position:0%
common with that town what does that
 
00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:45.030 align:start position:0%
common with that town what does that
mean

00:59:45.030 --> 00:59:45.040 align:start position:0%
mean
 
00:59:46.870 --> 00:59:46.880 align:start position:0%
shared school district
 
00:59:49.190 --> 00:59:49.200 align:start position:0%
shared water departments
 
00:59:51.109 --> 00:59:51.119 align:start position:0%
i don't know what that means
 
00:59:54.390 --> 00:59:54.400 align:start position:0%
i do know that the worst criteria
 
00:59:55.910 --> 00:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
is political
 
00:59:57.030 --> 00:59:57.040 align:start position:0%
based on
 
00:59:59.109 --> 00:59:59.119 align:start position:0%
party affiliation
 
01:00:00.309 --> 01:00:00.319 align:start position:0%
and that's what i'm afraid it's gonna
 
01:00:01.750 --> 01:00:01.760 align:start position:0%
happen here
 
01:00:04.230 --> 01:00:04.240 align:start position:0%
mr muns talked about i i didn't even
 
01:00:06.549 --> 01:00:06.559 align:start position:0%
know how bad uh the executive council of
 
01:00:09.109 --> 01:00:09.119 align:start position:0%
district two was until i started on a
 
01:00:11.349 --> 01:00:11.359 align:start position:0%
map and i thought
 
01:00:12.950 --> 01:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
you know when i'm in power that's what's
 
01:00:15.109 --> 01:00:15.119 align:start position:0%
going to happen so let me just give you
 
01:00:16.309 --> 01:00:16.319 align:start position:0%
just a little
 
01:00:16.319 --> 01:00:17.750 align:start position:0%
just a little
anecdote

01:00:17.750 --> 01:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
anecdote
 
01:00:19.670 --> 01:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
that may or may not have any uh
 
01:00:21.910 --> 01:00:21.920 align:start position:0%
relevance here
 
01:00:23.910 --> 01:00:23.920 align:start position:0%
um i used to coach a lot of rec sports
 
01:00:25.190 --> 01:00:25.200 align:start position:0%
when i was a kid
 
01:00:27.349 --> 01:00:27.359 align:start position:0%
and soccer especially he always have
 
01:00:28.870 --> 01:00:28.880 align:start position:0%
trouble getting enough kids to play the
 
01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:30.150 align:start position:0%
trouble getting enough kids to play the
game

01:00:30.150 --> 01:00:30.160 align:start position:0%
game
 
01:00:31.750 --> 01:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
so you show up and it's supposed to be
 
01:00:33.589 --> 01:00:33.599 align:start position:0%
11 and the other team would have nine or
 
01:00:35.910 --> 01:00:35.920 align:start position:0%
i would have nine he'd have 11.
 
01:00:37.510 --> 01:00:37.520 align:start position:0%
and the overwhelming majority of the
 
01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:38.470 align:start position:0%
and the overwhelming majority of the
time

01:00:38.470 --> 01:00:38.480 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:00:41.270 --> 01:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
we adjusted our rosters
 
01:00:43.910 --> 01:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
to play evenly if he had nine i would
 
01:00:45.910 --> 01:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
play nine
 
01:00:47.349 --> 01:00:47.359 align:start position:0%
and that's what i'm hoping is going to
 
01:00:48.630 --> 01:00:48.640 align:start position:0%
happen here just because you're in a
 
01:00:50.230 --> 01:00:50.240 align:start position:0%
position of power because you're in a
 
01:00:52.230 --> 01:00:52.240 align:start position:0%
position of majority
 
01:00:54.549 --> 01:00:54.559 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean you can't be fair
 
01:00:56.230 --> 01:00:56.240 align:start position:0%
because the table is going to turn
 
01:00:57.829 --> 01:00:57.839 align:start position:0%
someday and you're going to be on the
 
01:00:59.510 --> 01:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
losing side
 
01:01:01.910 --> 01:01:01.920 align:start position:0%
and one game we played
 
01:01:04.150 --> 01:01:04.160 align:start position:0%
the uh opposite coach decided to play
 
01:01:06.630 --> 01:01:06.640 align:start position:0%
his 11 against my eighth we got b
 
01:01:08.829 --> 01:01:08.839 align:start position:0%
and i was coaching 12 year olds at the
 
01:01:11.589 --> 01:01:11.599 align:start position:0%
time and they were old enough to know
 
01:01:13.349 --> 01:01:13.359 align:start position:0%
that that wasn't fair
 
01:01:14.870 --> 01:01:14.880 align:start position:0%
and we played that team later in the
 
01:01:18.870 --> 01:01:18.880 align:start position:0%
season at even strength we swamped them
 
01:01:20.470 --> 01:01:20.480 align:start position:0%
and the reason was because my kids
 
01:01:22.470 --> 01:01:22.480 align:start position:0%
remembered that they hadn't played fair
 
01:01:24.950 --> 01:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
and it gave them extra motivation
 
01:01:27.589 --> 01:01:27.599 align:start position:0%
so you democrats republicans whoever is
 
01:01:29.349 --> 01:01:29.359 align:start position:0%
in the majority particular time when
 
01:01:31.109 --> 01:01:31.119 align:start position:0%
these decisions are made
 
01:01:33.430 --> 01:01:33.440 align:start position:0%
has to remember that the
 
01:01:35.990 --> 01:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
the this it's gonna turn the tide is
 
01:01:37.670 --> 01:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
gonna turn someday you're not going to
 
01:01:40.470 --> 01:01:40.480 align:start position:0%
be the position of majority and i just
 
01:01:42.470 --> 01:01:42.480 align:start position:0%
hope that the opposite side
 
01:01:45.910 --> 01:01:45.920 align:start position:0%
is fair if you've been fair thank you
 
01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:01:57.430 --> 01:01:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:59.270 --> 01:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to accuse anybody of
 
01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:00.789 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to accuse anybody of
gerrymandering

01:02:00.789 --> 01:02:00.799 align:start position:0%
gerrymandering
 
01:02:03.829 --> 01:02:03.839 align:start position:0%
having served on election law when we
 
01:02:05.829 --> 01:02:05.839 align:start position:0%
had to
 
01:02:07.829 --> 01:02:07.839 align:start position:0%
divide the state up
 
01:02:12.069 --> 01:02:12.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:12.079 --> 01:02:13.589 align:start position:0%
 
the

01:02:13.589 --> 01:02:13.599 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:02:15.589 --> 01:02:15.599 align:start position:0%
other thing is to
 
01:02:19.109 --> 01:02:19.119 align:start position:0%
people here they remember it or not
 
01:02:20.829 --> 01:02:20.839 align:start position:0%
the last
 
01:02:25.029 --> 01:02:25.039 align:start position:0%
redistricting was done by the corpse
 
01:02:27.190 --> 01:02:27.200 align:start position:0%
and they joined us
 
01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:28.549 align:start position:0%
and they joined us
however

01:02:28.549 --> 01:02:28.559 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:02:31.270 --> 01:02:31.280 align:start position:0%
they decided i don't know
 
01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:32.630 align:start position:0%
they decided i don't know
so

01:02:32.630 --> 01:02:32.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:02:34.390 --> 01:02:34.400 align:start position:0%
i look at it
 
01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:36.390 align:start position:0%
i look at it
that

01:02:36.390 --> 01:02:36.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:02:39.510 --> 01:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
what i would love to have is every town
 
01:02:42.069 --> 01:02:42.079 align:start position:0%
represented i realize
 
01:02:43.109 --> 01:02:43.119 align:start position:0%
we don't
 
01:02:45.829 --> 01:02:45.839 align:start position:0%
have that in our constitution
 
01:02:47.349 --> 01:02:47.359 align:start position:0%
we have
 
01:02:50.230 --> 01:02:50.240 align:start position:0%
up to 400
 
01:02:52.069 --> 01:02:52.079 align:start position:0%
house members
 
01:02:55.349 --> 01:02:55.359 align:start position:0%
24 senators
 
01:02:59.910 --> 01:02:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:03.750 --> 01:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
is it possible a state rep
 
01:03:06.870 --> 01:03:06.880 align:start position:0%
in in my town for years we had roger
 
01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:07.990 align:start position:0%
in in my town for years we had roger
king

01:03:07.990 --> 01:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
king
 
01:03:10.870 --> 01:03:10.880 align:start position:0%
of whom one of the previous speakers
 
01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:12.470 align:start position:0%
of whom one of the previous speakers
followed

01:03:12.470 --> 01:03:12.480 align:start position:0%
followed
 
01:03:15.829 --> 01:03:15.839 align:start position:0%
and anybody could talk to roger
 
01:03:19.270 --> 01:03:19.280 align:start position:0%
that's what i want a legislator
 
01:03:22.309 --> 01:03:22.319 align:start position:0%
i can talk with and have them hear my
 
01:03:25.430 --> 01:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
point of view see my point of view
 
01:03:27.829 --> 01:03:27.839 align:start position:0%
and tell me why they don't support me
 
01:03:30.470 --> 01:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
and i have had that
 
01:03:31.910 --> 01:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
and i like that
 
01:03:35.029 --> 01:03:35.039 align:start position:0%
when i was a state rep i represented
 
01:03:35.039 --> 01:03:36.230 align:start position:0%
when i was a state rep i represented
nottingham

01:03:36.230 --> 01:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
nottingham
 
01:03:39.430 --> 01:03:39.440 align:start position:0%
northwood deerfield pandia
 
01:03:42.390 --> 01:03:42.400 align:start position:0%
and i made an effort once a month to go
 
01:03:44.390 --> 01:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
to each town
 
01:03:47.990 --> 01:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:51.029 --> 01:03:51.039 align:start position:0%
nottingham was fantastic we had people
 
01:03:54.069 --> 01:03:54.079 align:start position:0%
ask us what we would come on sunday
 
01:03:54.079 --> 01:03:55.270 align:start position:0%
ask us what we would come on sunday
and

01:03:55.270 --> 01:03:55.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:03:57.510 --> 01:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
vic vic now and i would go over one
 
01:03:59.349 --> 01:03:59.359 align:start position:0%
sunday a month
 
01:04:01.670 --> 01:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
and take any question they had on what
 
01:04:05.910 --> 01:04:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:08.309 --> 01:04:08.319 align:start position:0%
other towns we had to depend upon
 
01:04:11.990 --> 01:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
speaking to these selectmen
 
01:04:13.910 --> 01:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
i want to thank you all for doing this
 
01:04:17.510 --> 01:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
job it's a hard job to do because you
 
01:04:19.990 --> 01:04:20.000 align:start position:0%
always have dissatisfaction
 
01:04:22.309 --> 01:04:22.319 align:start position:0%
with somebody
 
01:04:26.309 --> 01:04:26.319 align:start position:0%
but i know what it is to redistrict
 
01:04:27.829 --> 01:04:27.839 align:start position:0%
when we did it
 
01:04:30.630 --> 01:04:30.640 align:start position:0%
in 2002
 
01:04:32.950 --> 01:04:32.960 align:start position:0%
my committee did it
 
01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:37.190 align:start position:0%
my committee did it
2003.

01:04:37.190 --> 01:04:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:40.630 --> 01:04:40.640 align:start position:0%
but when the court did it
 
01:04:45.589 --> 01:04:45.599 align:start position:0%
we had a real mix-up of towns
 
01:04:45.599 --> 01:04:46.710 align:start position:0%
we had a real mix-up of towns
and

01:04:46.710 --> 01:04:46.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:04:48.150 --> 01:04:48.160 align:start position:0%
i have seen
 
01:04:51.029 --> 01:04:51.039 align:start position:0%
the legislature go from republican to
 
01:04:53.670 --> 01:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
all democrat to republican
 
01:04:54.950 --> 01:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
so that
 
01:04:57.349 --> 01:04:57.359 align:start position:0%
it changes off
 
01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:03.109 --> 01:05:03.119 align:start position:0%
people understanding our government
 
01:05:07.029 --> 01:05:07.039 align:start position:0%
that's what i feel the strongest about
 
01:05:09.349 --> 01:05:09.359 align:start position:0%
we really need
 
01:05:13.510 --> 01:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
more education in how new hampshire's
 
01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:15.029 align:start position:0%
more education in how new hampshire's
legislature

01:05:15.029 --> 01:05:15.039 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
01:05:18.470 --> 01:05:18.480 align:start position:0%
executive council and governor work

you gory warnock has also signed up from
hampstead

01:05:33.829 --> 01:05:33.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:36.630 --> 01:05:36.640 align:start position:0%
good evening and thank you uh senators
 
01:05:38.549 --> 01:05:38.559 align:start position:0%
and representatives for holding this
 
01:05:40.950 --> 01:05:40.960 align:start position:0%
session tonight so that you can be heard
 
01:05:43.349 --> 01:05:43.359 align:start position:0%
as mentioned i am from hampstead i'm a
 
01:05:47.029 --> 01:05:47.039 align:start position:0%
taxpayer a voter and a selector
 
01:05:49.190 --> 01:05:49.200 align:start position:0%
i'm not here in my role as a selectman
 
01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:50.710 align:start position:0%
i'm not here in my role as a selectman
however

01:05:50.710 --> 01:05:50.720 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:05:53.430 --> 01:05:53.440 align:start position:0%
i have to agree with my
 
01:05:57.190 --> 01:05:57.200 align:start position:0%
compatriot mr guthrie although we often
 
01:06:00.150 --> 01:06:00.160 align:start position:0%
are on opposite sides of the question i
 
01:06:02.230 --> 01:06:02.240 align:start position:0%
think we do share
 
01:06:03.589 --> 01:06:03.599 align:start position:0%
a common goal
 
01:06:06.150 --> 01:06:06.160 align:start position:0%
in that we both feel
 
01:06:08.789 --> 01:06:08.799 align:start position:0%
that hampstead as with many of the other
 
01:06:08.799 --> 01:06:09.990 align:start position:0%
that hampstead as with many of the other
communities

01:06:09.990 --> 01:06:10.000 align:start position:0%
communities
 
01:06:11.910 --> 01:06:11.920 align:start position:0%
deserve their constitutionally
 
01:06:14.150 --> 01:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
guaranteed right to representation as
 
01:06:15.190 --> 01:06:15.200 align:start position:0%
someone who
 
01:06:17.430 --> 01:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
ran for a representative
 
01:06:18.950 --> 01:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
in the last session
 
01:06:21.430 --> 01:06:21.440 align:start position:0%
i know how challenging it is to really
 
01:06:23.990 --> 01:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
master the needs of my own community let
 
01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:25.430 align:start position:0%
master the needs of my own community let
alone

01:06:25.430 --> 01:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
alone
 
01:06:27.190 --> 01:06:27.200 align:start position:0%
trying to understand the needs of the
 
01:06:29.190 --> 01:06:29.200 align:start position:0%
communities adjacent
 
01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:30.789 align:start position:0%
communities adjacent
and

01:06:30.789 --> 01:06:30.799 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:06:32.470 --> 01:06:32.480 align:start position:0%
while i don't end with the job of our
 
01:06:34.710 --> 01:06:34.720 align:start position:0%
senators who have several communities i
 
01:06:36.630 --> 01:06:36.640 align:start position:0%
have to represent
 
01:06:38.230 --> 01:06:38.240 align:start position:0%
i think we have
 
01:06:40.069 --> 01:06:40.079 align:start position:0%
really demonstrated the population of
 
01:06:41.670 --> 01:06:41.680 align:start position:0%
over 8 000
 
01:06:44.069 --> 01:06:44.079 align:start position:0%
that we don't share a school district
 
01:06:46.549 --> 01:06:46.559 align:start position:0%
with kingston we don't share any of our
 
01:06:48.549 --> 01:06:48.559 align:start position:0%
public safety
 
01:06:50.789 --> 01:06:50.799 align:start position:0%
entities with other communities we are
 
01:06:52.390 --> 01:06:52.400 align:start position:0%
an entity in and of ourselves with our
 
01:06:53.750 --> 01:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
own needs
 
01:06:57.029 --> 01:06:57.039 align:start position:0%
and so i hope that going forward as
 
01:06:59.510 --> 01:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
representative guthrie mentioned
 
01:07:01.270 --> 01:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
the tables do turn
 
01:07:02.549 --> 01:07:02.559 align:start position:0%
and i think it's in
 
01:07:04.150 --> 01:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
all of our best interests to come up
 
01:07:06.549 --> 01:07:06.559 align:start position:0%
with a fair process that is transparent
 
01:07:07.589 --> 01:07:07.599 align:start position:0%
that is
 
01:07:09.589 --> 01:07:09.599 align:start position:0%
gives notice of at least 10 days of
 
01:07:11.430 --> 01:07:11.440 align:start position:0%
these public hearings so that the public
 
01:07:14.150 --> 01:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
is available to participate that does
 
01:07:16.069 --> 01:07:16.079 align:start position:0%
allow the remote testimony because we
 
01:07:18.470 --> 01:07:18.480 align:start position:0%
know that there are still folks that are
 
01:07:20.549 --> 01:07:20.559 align:start position:0%
at risk in attending large gatherings
 
01:07:21.750 --> 01:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
like these
 
01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:23.029 align:start position:0%
like these
and

01:07:23.029 --> 01:07:23.039 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:07:23.039 --> 01:07:23.829 align:start position:0%
and
that

01:07:23.829 --> 01:07:23.839 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:07:26.470 --> 01:07:26.480 align:start position:0%
you know make the effort to really make
 
01:07:28.230 --> 01:07:28.240 align:start position:0%
this a public event which i do
 
01:07:29.670 --> 01:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
appreciate when you mention it will be
 
01:07:31.190 --> 01:07:31.200 align:start position:0%
live streamed and that will be recorded
 
01:07:32.390 --> 01:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
as well so
 
01:07:33.510 --> 01:07:33.520 align:start position:0%

thank you madam chair
 
01:08:00.630 --> 01:08:00.640 align:start position:0%

01:08:04.150 --> 01:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
this table from my past experience
 
01:08:07.029 --> 01:08:07.039 align:start position:0%
thank you for your work to address the
 
01:08:08.549 --> 01:08:08.559 align:start position:0%
monumental task
 
01:08:11.349 --> 01:08:11.359 align:start position:0%
of creating social economic and
 
01:08:15.109 --> 01:08:15.119 align:start position:0%
political balance within new hampshire
 
01:08:17.990 --> 01:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
this is a dangerously polarized time for
 
01:08:19.590 --> 01:08:19.600 align:start position:0%
our state
 
01:08:21.910 --> 01:08:21.920 align:start position:0%
and you have the opportunity yes you
 
01:08:23.829 --> 01:08:23.839 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to address this
 
01:08:26.149 --> 01:08:26.159 align:start position:0%
fractured status
 
01:08:28.789 --> 01:08:28.799 align:start position:0%
by creating responsible and fair
 
01:08:30.709 --> 01:08:30.719 align:start position:0%
electoral districts
 
01:08:39.669 --> 01:08:39.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:41.829 --> 01:08:41.839 align:start position:0%
rockingham county has experienced
 
01:08:44.309 --> 01:08:44.319 align:start position:0%
considerable growth and transformation
 
01:08:46.229 --> 01:08:46.239 align:start position:0%
in the last decade
 
01:08:49.189 --> 01:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
with changes in its populations social
 
01:08:52.709 --> 01:08:52.719 align:start position:0%
economic and political dynamics
 
01:08:55.189 --> 01:08:55.199 align:start position:0%
in particular i would like to address
 
01:08:58.149 --> 01:08:58.159 align:start position:0%
the needs of senate district 23 in which
 
01:08:59.189 --> 01:08:59.199 align:start position:0%
i live
 
01:09:01.510 --> 01:09:01.520 align:start position:0%
and from which i serve three terms in
 
01:09:04.149 --> 01:09:04.159 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire house
 
01:09:06.390 --> 01:09:06.400 align:start position:0%
the current district includes the towns
 
01:09:08.709 --> 01:09:08.719 align:start position:0%
of exeter and east
 
01:09:11.349 --> 01:09:11.359 align:start position:0%
to chester in the west
 
01:09:15.829 --> 01:09:15.839 align:start position:0%
these towns have divergent orientations
 
01:09:20.229 --> 01:09:20.239 align:start position:0%
either toward the salem i-23 quarter
 
01:09:25.829 --> 01:09:25.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:29.030 --> 01:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
if you could consider a redistricting of
 
01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:29.990 align:start position:0%
if you could consider a redistricting of
senate

01:09:29.990 --> 01:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
senate
 
01:09:32.470 --> 01:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
district 23
 
01:09:35.110 --> 01:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
i propose a plan that would acknowledge
 
01:09:38.470 --> 01:09:38.480 align:start position:0%
the social and economic realities of
 
01:09:41.990 --> 01:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
this part of the state
 
01:09:44.550 --> 01:09:44.560 align:start position:0%
this plan would completely or almost
 
01:09:46.309 --> 01:09:46.319 align:start position:0%
completely include
 
01:09:50.870 --> 01:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
three large school districts or saus
 
01:09:54.070 --> 01:09:54.080 align:start position:0%
which are currently distributed among
 
01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:55.030 align:start position:0%
which are currently distributed among
four

01:09:55.030 --> 01:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
four
 
01:09:57.990 --> 01:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
senate districts
 
01:10:00.070 --> 01:10:00.080 align:start position:0%
this alternative district would also
 
01:10:03.270 --> 01:10:03.280 align:start position:0%
include major commercial centers located
 
01:10:06.070 --> 01:10:06.080 align:start position:0%
in epping and exeter which are
 
01:10:10.229 --> 01:10:10.239 align:start position:0%
frequented by people in these towns
 
01:10:12.470 --> 01:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
this alternative plan would take into
 
01:10:15.270 --> 01:10:15.280 align:start position:0%
account the natural affinities of the
 
01:10:17.430 --> 01:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
pot of the population
 
01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:18.390 align:start position:0%
pot of the population
in

01:10:18.390 --> 01:10:18.400 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:10:22.149 --> 01:10:22.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:22.159 --> 01:10:24.070 align:start position:0%
 
politically

01:10:24.070 --> 01:10:24.080 align:start position:0%
politically
 
01:10:26.390 --> 01:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
district 23 has been dominated by
 
01:10:28.830 --> 01:10:28.840 align:start position:0%
republican voters for
 
01:10:32.550 --> 01:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
decades this alternative plan by my
 
01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:34.070 align:start position:0%
decades this alternative plan by my
estimation

01:10:34.070 --> 01:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
estimation
 
01:10:36.790 --> 01:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
would continue with republican voter
 
01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:38.550 align:start position:0%
would continue with republican voter
domination

01:10:38.550 --> 01:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
domination
 
01:10:42.149 --> 01:10:42.159 align:start position:0%
however by judging from the current
 
01:10:44.870 --> 01:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
house reps in these towns
 
01:10:47.590 --> 01:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
there would be a slight increase in
 
01:10:49.830 --> 01:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
democratic voters
 
01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
thus contributing to a more equitable
 
01:10:55.430 --> 01:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
political division
 
01:10:57.910 --> 01:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
what i think also should be a goal of
 
01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:00.470 align:start position:0%
what i think also should be a goal of
redistricting

01:11:00.470 --> 01:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
redistricting
 
01:11:03.590 --> 01:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
i offer this plan for your consideration
 
01:11:06.790 --> 01:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
which maintains a stable population size
 
01:11:08.709 --> 01:11:08.719 align:start position:0%
within the district
 
01:11:11.510 --> 01:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
as you proceed with your deliberations
 
01:11:14.310 --> 01:11:14.320 align:start position:0%
in an open and transparent manner as
 
01:11:17.669 --> 01:11:17.679 align:start position:0%
you've heard from so many people tonight
 
01:11:19.430 --> 01:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
we hope that there will be time for
 
01:11:20.870 --> 01:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
public scrutiny
 
01:11:23.750 --> 01:11:23.760 align:start position:0%

01:12:55.430 --> 01:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
and then my hope is that public input is
 
01:12:57.350 --> 01:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
truly considered in establishing fair
 
01:13:00.470 --> 01:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
districts and therefore i ask that maps
 
01:13:02.709 --> 01:13:02.719 align:start position:0%
have drawn and shared with the public
 
01:13:04.630 --> 01:13:04.640 align:start position:0%
with the intent that further public
 
01:13:06.310 --> 01:13:06.320 align:start position:0%
opinion is allowed
 
01:13:07.830 --> 01:13:07.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:13:10.070 --> 01:13:10.080 align:start position:0%

a redistricting plan consistent with the

passed unanimously
 
01:14:28.149 --> 01:14:28.159 align:start position:0%
an article that urged new hampshire
 
01:14:29.430 --> 01:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
general court to carry out the
 
01:14:32.149 --> 01:14:32.159 align:start position:0%
redistricting in a fair and transparent
 
01:14:34.470 --> 01:14:34.480 align:start position:0%
way through public meetings not to favor
 
01:14:36.790 --> 01:14:36.800 align:start position:0%
a particular political party and to
 
01:14:39.110 --> 01:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
include communities of interest and to
 
01:14:42.070 --> 01:14:42.080 align:start position:0%
minimize multi-seat districts
 
01:14:43.910 --> 01:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
the article furthermore cited the new
 
01:14:46.550 --> 01:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire state constitution part 2
 
01:14:49.030 --> 01:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
article 11 allowing towns of sufficient
 
01:14:50.630 --> 01:14:50.640 align:start position:0%
population to have their own state
 
01:14:52.709 --> 01:14:52.719 align:start position:0%
representatives and not share with other
 
01:14:52.719 --> 01:14:53.750 align:start position:0%
representatives and not share with other
towns

01:14:53.750 --> 01:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
towns
 
01:14:55.510 --> 01:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
and directed the town to petition the
 
01:14:57.830 --> 01:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
general court for its own exclusive seat
 
01:15:00.709 --> 01:15:00.719 align:start position:0%
in the house of representatives
 
01:15:02.470 --> 01:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
i'd like to speak specifically to why
 
01:15:03.990 --> 01:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
chester should be provided with a
 
01:15:06.870 --> 01:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
dedicated representative
 
01:15:08.870 --> 01:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
chester currently is in rockingham
 
01:15:10.950 --> 01:15:10.960 align:start position:0%
district four including auburn chester
 
01:15:12.229 --> 01:15:12.239 align:start position:0%
and sandown
 
01:15:13.630 --> 01:15:13.640 align:start position:0%
which have
 
01:15:16.950 --> 01:15:16.960 align:start position:0%
4953 4786
 
01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:17.790 align:start position:0%
4953 4786
and

01:15:17.790 --> 01:15:17.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:15:20.950 --> 01:15:20.960 align:start position:0%
5986 citizens respectively
 
01:15:24.709 --> 01:15:24.719 align:start position:0%
that's 15 0707 in total
 
01:15:26.390 --> 01:15:26.400 align:start position:0%
five representatives are elected to
 
01:15:28.790 --> 01:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
serve all three towns collectively since
 
01:15:32.550 --> 01:15:32.560 align:start position:0%
each town has more than 3 44 citizens
 
01:15:35.189 --> 01:15:35.199 align:start position:0%
required for dedicated representative
 
01:15:36.870 --> 01:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
we hope it would be possible and in
 
01:15:38.790 --> 01:15:38.800 align:start position:0%
compliance with the constitution to do
 
01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:40.390 align:start position:0%
compliance with the constitution to do
so

01:15:40.390 --> 01:15:40.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:15:42.310 --> 01:15:42.320 align:start position:0%
with respect to chester
 
01:15:44.709 --> 01:15:44.719 align:start position:0%
as others have noted about their town
 
01:15:46.790 --> 01:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
we are a unique community
 
01:15:49.350 --> 01:15:49.360 align:start position:0%
bound together by where we live and our
 
01:15:50.950 --> 01:15:50.960 align:start position:0%
common interest in supporting our
 
01:15:52.470 --> 01:15:52.480 align:start position:0%
friends and neighbors
 
01:15:54.630 --> 01:15:54.640 align:start position:0%
and the chester way of life
 
01:15:56.229 --> 01:15:56.239 align:start position:0%
far more than we are bound to any
 
01:15:58.470 --> 01:15:58.480 align:start position:0%
particular political party
 
01:16:01.110 --> 01:16:01.120 align:start position:0%
we have long history and traditions next
 
01:16:03.110 --> 01:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
year chester would celebrate its 300th
 
01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:04.390 align:start position:0%
year chester would celebrate its 300th
anniversary

01:16:04.390 --> 01:16:04.400 align:start position:0%
anniversary
 
01:16:06.229 --> 01:16:06.239 align:start position:0%
and we work very much together as
 
01:16:08.470 --> 01:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
citizens and volunteers whether to
 
01:16:11.030 --> 01:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
preserve our historic leading house
 
01:16:13.350 --> 01:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
from the 1700s support the quality of
 
01:16:15.590 --> 01:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
our schools our roads and bridges our
 
01:16:17.990 --> 01:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
conservation land the quality of our
 
01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:19.590 align:start position:0%
conservation land the quality of our
water

01:16:19.590 --> 01:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
water
 
01:16:21.270 --> 01:16:21.280 align:start position:0%
but also we work together to keep our
 
01:16:24.630 --> 01:16:24.640 align:start position:0%
property taxes as low as we can
 
01:16:26.950 --> 01:16:26.960 align:start position:0%
these are largest expenditures for most
 
01:16:28.550 --> 01:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
of our residents
 
01:16:29.990 --> 01:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
our state representatives and the
 
01:16:31.910 --> 01:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
decisions of the general court and the
 
01:16:33.430 --> 01:16:33.440 align:start position:0%
state government as a whole have
 
01:16:36.229 --> 01:16:36.239 align:start position:0%
significant impact on the services and
 
01:16:38.470 --> 01:16:38.480 align:start position:0%
funding we receive each year to ensure
 
01:16:40.630 --> 01:16:40.640 align:start position:0%
our quality of life and determine how
 
01:16:42.950 --> 01:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
much our property taxes increase or
 
01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:44.630 align:start position:0%
much our property taxes increase or
decrease

01:16:44.630 --> 01:16:44.640 align:start position:0%
decrease
 
01:16:47.110 --> 01:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
the fact that this is largely controlled
 
01:16:48.950 --> 01:16:48.960 align:start position:0%
significantly controlled by the state
 
01:16:51.110 --> 01:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
and not the town is what we call in
 
01:16:54.149 --> 01:16:54.159 align:start position:0%
chester the new hampshire disadvantage
 
01:16:55.830 --> 01:16:55.840 align:start position:0%
it is important to have a dedicated
 
01:16:58.149 --> 01:16:58.159 align:start position:0%
representative who is always focused on
 
01:16:59.669 --> 01:16:59.679 align:start position:0%
the impact votes and decisions of
 
01:17:01.430 --> 01:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
concord will have on our chester
 
01:17:04.470 --> 01:17:04.480 align:start position:0%
priorities and our local taxes
 
01:17:06.149 --> 01:17:06.159 align:start position:0%
a dedicated representative from the
 
01:17:08.229 --> 01:17:08.239 align:start position:0%
chester community will also be able to
 
01:17:08.239 --> 01:17:09.189 align:start position:0%
chester community will also be able to
focus

01:17:09.189 --> 01:17:09.199 align:start position:0%
focus
 
01:17:11.510 --> 01:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
just on the citizens of chester the 4
 
01:17:15.590 --> 01:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
700 rather than more than 15 000
 
01:17:17.990 --> 01:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
gene sharon who was one of our former
 
01:17:19.830 --> 01:17:19.840 align:start position:0%
state representatives
 
01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:20.950 align:start position:0%
state representatives
spoke

01:17:20.950 --> 01:17:20.960 align:start position:0%
spoke
 
01:17:23.270 --> 01:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
at our town meeting about his experience
 
01:17:26.390 --> 01:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
trying to represent the district
 
01:17:28.550 --> 01:17:28.560 align:start position:0%
he noted that representatives perform a
 
01:17:30.790 --> 01:17:30.800 align:start position:0%
lot of work that people don't see
 
01:17:33.270 --> 01:17:33.280 align:start position:0%
for individual constituents it's very
 
01:17:35.350 --> 01:17:35.360 align:start position:0%
important but it's also very time
 
01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:36.790 align:start position:0%
important but it's also very time
consuming

01:17:36.790 --> 01:17:36.800 align:start position:0%
consuming
 
01:17:38.630 --> 01:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
he noted that chester qualified some
 
01:17:41.189 --> 01:17:41.199 align:start position:0%
years ago for a single representative
 
01:17:43.430 --> 01:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
and that when he served it was a stretch
 
01:17:46.229 --> 01:17:46.239 align:start position:0%
for him to serve all the representatives
 
01:17:48.390 --> 01:17:48.400 align:start position:0%
across the three towns
 
01:17:50.149 --> 01:17:50.159 align:start position:0%
he noted the chester community needs a
 
01:17:52.149 --> 01:17:52.159 align:start position:0%
representative who will have the time
 
01:17:54.310 --> 01:17:54.320 align:start position:0%
and the interest in the town
 
01:17:56.870 --> 01:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
to answer people's phone calls
 
01:17:59.830 --> 01:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
and return them and act on their behalf
 
01:18:01.590 --> 01:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
i expect the residents of auburn and
 
01:18:03.189 --> 01:18:03.199 align:start position:0%
sandown and other towns without
 
01:18:05.189 --> 01:18:05.199 align:start position:0%
dedicated representatives feel the way
 
01:18:07.350 --> 01:18:07.360 align:start position:0%
people in chesterfield each town is
 
01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:08.550 align:start position:0%
people in chesterfield each town is
unique

01:18:08.550 --> 01:18:08.560 align:start position:0%
unique
 
01:18:10.149 --> 01:18:10.159 align:start position:0%
we are focused in new hampshire on the
 
01:18:12.630 --> 01:18:12.640 align:start position:0%
community in which we live not on the
 
01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:13.669 align:start position:0%
community in which we live not on the
state

01:18:13.669 --> 01:18:13.679 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:18:17.350 --> 01:18:17.360 align:start position:0%
or not on the national politics
 
01:18:19.750 --> 01:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
it's the community where we will where
 
01:18:21.590 --> 01:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
we live and we will benefit from a
 
01:18:23.669 --> 01:18:23.679 align:start position:0%
dedicated representative to help in the
 
01:18:25.750 --> 01:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
state house to promote our views and
 
01:18:27.750 --> 01:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
hold the state government accountable
 
01:18:30.229 --> 01:18:30.239 align:start position:0%
for taking actions to help control our
 
01:18:32.870 --> 01:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
local property taxes
 
01:18:34.149 --> 01:18:34.159 align:start position:0%
along with the other citizens of
 
01:18:35.669 --> 01:18:35.679 align:start position:0%
rockhampton county i'll look forward to
 
01:18:38.070 --> 01:18:38.080 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to review and comment on
 
01:18:39.750 --> 01:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
the redistrict proposal from your
 
01:18:41.830 --> 01:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
committee when it is complete
 
01:18:43.669 --> 01:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
and i hope you will decide to provide
 
01:18:45.750 --> 01:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
dedicated representatives for chester
 
01:18:48.149 --> 01:18:48.159 align:start position:0%
and other qualified towns

i appreciate um
 
01:19:18.070 --> 01:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
elected representatives where it is a
 
01:19:20.830 --> 01:19:20.840 align:start position:0%
professional job with a volunteer
 
01:19:23.990 --> 01:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
salary and each of the volunteers here
 
01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:25.270 align:start position:0%
salary and each of the volunteers here
are

01:19:25.270 --> 01:19:25.280 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:19:28.149 --> 01:19:28.159 align:start position:0%
responsible to their own community
 
01:19:30.229 --> 01:19:30.239 align:start position:0%
when i look around i see a specific
 
01:19:30.239 --> 01:19:31.830 align:start position:0%
when i look around i see a specific
demographic

01:19:31.830 --> 01:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
demographic
 
01:19:34.790 --> 01:19:34.800 align:start position:0%
on where you are but also behind me
 
01:19:37.590 --> 01:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
where people myself like myself and
 
01:19:39.830 --> 01:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
younger are not represented here
 
01:19:44.149 --> 01:19:44.159 align:start position:0%
and that is a large part because of the
 
01:19:46.229 --> 01:19:46.239 align:start position:0%
responsibilities that we have that are
 
01:19:49.590 --> 01:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
pulling us in different directions
 
01:19:51.990 --> 01:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
however covid and emergency rulings
 
01:19:54.390 --> 01:19:54.400 align:start position:0%
allowed in our community for online
 
01:19:56.390 --> 01:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
meetings and that allowed for increased
 
01:19:59.030 --> 01:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
participation and i would ask that this
 
01:20:00.870 --> 01:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
committee consider
 
01:20:03.590 --> 01:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
a more inclusive opportunity for a more
 
01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:05.669 align:start position:0%
a more inclusive opportunity for a more
diverse

01:20:05.669 --> 01:20:05.679 align:start position:0%
diverse
 
01:20:09.750 --> 01:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:11.110 --> 01:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
in chester
 
01:20:13.510 --> 01:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
we have a small community a very active
 
01:20:15.669 --> 01:20:15.679 align:start position:0%
community and we meet our
 
01:20:18.550 --> 01:20:18.560 align:start position:0%
representatives at town fair
 
01:20:22.070 --> 01:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:24.629 --> 01:20:24.639 align:start position:0%
at election day this is an opportunity
 
01:20:27.990 --> 01:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
for us to speak directly to our
 
01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.390 align:start position:0%
for us to speak directly to our
representatives

01:20:30.390 --> 01:20:30.400 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
01:20:33.270 --> 01:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
and if we do not have someone in our
 
01:20:35.270 --> 01:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
exact community we don't have direct
 
01:20:37.350 --> 01:20:37.360 align:start position:0%
representation and that is something
 
01:20:39.189 --> 01:20:39.199 align:start position:0%
that as a new hampshire resident we
 
01:20:40.790 --> 01:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
should have
 
01:20:42.950 --> 01:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
i also do really look forward to the
 
01:20:45.270 --> 01:20:45.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity after the master john to
 
01:20:47.510 --> 01:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
have a second public comment
 
01:20:49.510 --> 01:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
to discuss the reasons that you've
 
01:20:51.270 --> 01:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
chosen to
 
01:20:53.590 --> 01:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
place the communities together
 
01:20:54.870 --> 01:20:54.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:21:06.870 --> 01:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:11.669 --> 01:21:11.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:19.910 --> 01:21:19.920 align:start position:0%

thoughts with you as you are entering
 
01:21:30.950 --> 01:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
into this process
 
01:21:30.960 --> 01:21:31.830 align:start position:0%
into this process
um

01:21:31.830 --> 01:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:31.840 --> 01:21:32.709 align:start position:0%
um
the

01:21:32.709 --> 01:21:32.719 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:21:35.669 --> 01:21:35.679 align:start position:0%
the town of wingham did pass a warrant
 
01:21:35.679 --> 01:21:36.550 align:start position:0%
the town of wingham did pass a warrant
article

01:21:36.550 --> 01:21:36.560 align:start position:0%
article
 
01:21:38.470 --> 01:21:38.480 align:start position:0%
where the majority vast majority of the
 
01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:39.590 align:start position:0%
where the majority vast majority of the
town

01:21:39.590 --> 01:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
town
 
01:21:42.790 --> 01:21:42.800 align:start position:0%
requested that this committee would go
 
01:21:44.310 --> 01:21:44.320 align:start position:0%
through this process in a fair and
 
01:21:47.350 --> 01:21:47.360 align:start position:0%
transparent manner and in a way that is
 
01:21:49.270 --> 01:21:49.280 align:start position:0%
respectful of
 
01:21:53.910 --> 01:21:53.920 align:start position:0%
not just the geographical divides but
 
01:21:56.470 --> 01:21:56.480 align:start position:0%
or geographical locations but also many
 
01:21:58.550 --> 01:21:58.560 align:start position:0%
varied interest groups that make new
 
01:22:02.310 --> 01:22:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:04.790 --> 01:22:04.800 align:start position:0%
i would like to speak up to
 
01:22:08.149 --> 01:22:08.159 align:start position:0%
requests that you do acknowledge and
 
01:22:09.990 --> 01:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
make possible for each town that is
 
01:22:11.350 --> 01:22:11.360 align:start position:0%
eligible to have his own state
 
01:22:13.830 --> 01:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
representatives um windham and the last
 
01:22:16.470 --> 01:22:16.480 align:start position:0%
redistricting were separated from salem
 
01:22:18.790 --> 01:22:18.800 align:start position:0%
and when you look at them population
 
01:22:21.590 --> 01:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
wise when him was very much dwarfed and
 
01:22:24.390 --> 01:22:24.400 align:start position:0%
continues to be very much dwarfed by
 
01:22:26.790 --> 01:22:26.800 align:start position:0%
our next door neighbor
 
01:22:29.669 --> 01:22:29.679 align:start position:0%
and by having your own representatives
 
01:22:30.950 --> 01:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
from your own town you get the
 
01:22:33.510 --> 01:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity to rub elbows with them as
 
01:22:35.030 --> 01:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
we said at the transfer station at the
 
01:22:37.910 --> 01:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
grocery store local restaurants
 
01:22:40.149 --> 01:22:40.159 align:start position:0%
and it really provides a two-way street
 
01:22:43.750 --> 01:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
of information a lot of people um
 
01:22:45.270 --> 01:22:45.280 align:start position:0%
believe it or not don't sit and watch
 
01:22:46.870 --> 01:22:46.880 align:start position:0%
all the broadcasts of every committee
 
01:22:46.880 --> 01:22:47.830 align:start position:0%
all the broadcasts of every committee
meeting

01:22:47.830 --> 01:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
01:22:50.310 --> 01:22:50.320 align:start position:0%
but it gives the opportunity um to say
 
01:22:51.910 --> 01:22:51.920 align:start position:0%
hey what's going on in concord and how
 
01:22:54.790 --> 01:22:54.800 align:start position:0%
does that relate to to windham as well
 
01:22:57.030 --> 01:22:57.040 align:start position:0%
as if there is something that you want
 
01:22:59.110 --> 01:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
to speak up about a lot of people
 
01:23:01.110 --> 01:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
um although you guys are all very nice
 
01:23:03.830 --> 01:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
are hesitant to go speak publicly
 
01:23:05.510 --> 01:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
but it does give them that opportunity
 
01:23:07.270 --> 01:23:07.280 align:start position:0%
when they see the representatives around
 
01:23:10.790 --> 01:23:10.800 align:start position:0%
town to be able to give that input
 
01:23:13.430 --> 01:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
and so that that
 
01:23:15.430 --> 01:23:15.440 align:start position:0%
two-way street kind of works its way up
 
01:23:17.830 --> 01:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
the ladder as well for the state summit
 
01:23:20.470 --> 01:23:20.480 align:start position:0%
districts for the executive council
 
01:23:23.510 --> 01:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
districts and as was mentioned um
 
01:23:26.550 --> 01:23:26.560 align:start position:0%
executive council district 2 is crazy
 
01:23:27.830 --> 01:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
um you know if you look at the way it
 
01:23:29.990 --> 01:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
goes all the way across the state very
 
01:23:33.030 --> 01:23:33.040 align:start position:0%
diverse regions that it represents and
 
01:23:36.149 --> 01:23:36.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:37.750 --> 01:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
issues that the different areas of the
 
01:23:39.990 --> 01:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
state are going through i can't even
 
01:23:42.229 --> 01:23:42.239 align:start position:0%
imagine trying to wrap my head around
 
01:23:44.790 --> 01:23:44.800 align:start position:0%
all of the issues across that whole that
 
01:23:47.110 --> 01:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
whole district
 
01:23:49.270 --> 01:23:49.280 align:start position:0%
so i would
 
01:23:51.189 --> 01:23:51.199 align:start position:0%
respectfully request as you go through
 
01:23:52.629 --> 01:23:52.639 align:start position:0%
this process
 
01:23:54.470 --> 01:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
that you do recognize the number of
 
01:23:56.470 --> 01:23:56.480 align:start position:0%
towns in new hampshire that did pass the
 
01:23:59.510 --> 01:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
warrant articles and in that way spoke
 
01:24:01.510 --> 01:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
to directly to you
 
01:24:03.860 --> 01:24:03.870 align:start position:0%
and the rest of the legislature in
 
01:24:03.870 --> 01:24:05.110 align:start position:0%
and the rest of the legislature in
[Music]

01:24:05.110 --> 01:24:05.120 align:start position:0%

01:24:06.950 --> 01:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
redistricting in a way that is fair and
 
01:24:09.350 --> 01:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
transparent reflective of our state and
 
01:24:10.709 --> 01:24:10.719 align:start position:0%
our demographics and without
 
01:24:10.719 --> 01:24:13.110 align:start position:0%
our demographics and without
gerrymandering

01:24:13.110 --> 01:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
gerrymandering
 
01:24:15.189 --> 01:24:15.199 align:start position:0%
i would also like to ask too that in
 
01:24:16.790 --> 01:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
this process that the maps are made
 
01:24:19.750 --> 01:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
available both to the
 
01:24:21.430 --> 01:24:21.440 align:start position:0%
legislature that's going to be voting on
 
01:24:23.830 --> 01:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
them but also to the public with enough
 
01:24:26.229 --> 01:24:26.239 align:start position:0%
time for careful consideration before
 
01:24:28.310 --> 01:24:28.320 align:start position:0%
the votes are made so that further input
 
01:24:29.830 --> 01:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
can be made
 
01:24:31.510 --> 01:24:31.520 align:start position:0%

01:25:47.920 --> 01:25:48.709 align:start position:0%
 
hello

01:25:48.709 --> 01:25:48.719 align:start position:0%
hello
 
01:25:51.110 --> 01:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
i'm king i'm trish ted i am a lifelong
 
01:25:54.390 --> 01:25:54.400 align:start position:0%
resident of kingston
 
01:25:56.149 --> 01:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
um just a couple of things on the
 
01:25:57.990 --> 01:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
numbers um kingston and hampstead are
 
01:26:00.390 --> 01:26:00.400 align:start position:0%
grouped together as our district
 
01:26:02.950 --> 01:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
um we are not equal
 
01:26:04.390 --> 01:26:04.400 align:start position:0%
kingston is actually smaller than
 
01:26:06.629 --> 01:26:06.639 align:start position:0%
hampstead but quite a bit uh yesterday
 
01:26:08.629 --> 01:26:08.639 align:start position:0%
about one third larger
 
01:26:08.639 --> 01:26:09.750 align:start position:0%
about one third larger
so

01:26:09.750 --> 01:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:26:11.830 --> 01:26:11.840 align:start position:0%
our representatives having an agreement
 
01:26:14.709 --> 01:26:14.719 align:start position:0%
between themselves
 
01:26:17.669 --> 01:26:17.679 align:start position:0%
to have two from each town actually does
 
01:26:20.709 --> 01:26:20.719 align:start position:0%
the town of hampstead disservice because
 
01:26:22.870 --> 01:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
if we just went on the votes they would
 
01:26:26.870 --> 01:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
have more of the same than kingston does
 
01:26:28.950 --> 01:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
so unlike what what the representative
 
01:26:28.960 --> 01:26:30.070 align:start position:0%
so unlike what what the representative
claimed

01:26:30.070 --> 01:26:30.080 align:start position:0%
claimed
 
01:26:32.550 --> 01:26:32.560 align:start position:0%
there also is no way to guarantee equal
 
01:26:32.560 --> 01:26:34.950 align:start position:0%
there also is no way to guarantee equal
representation

01:26:34.950 --> 01:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
representation
 
01:26:36.950 --> 01:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
it's just an agreement between
 
01:26:40.310 --> 01:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
the current floor reps that we have
 
01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:41.910 align:start position:0%
the current floor reps that we have
um

01:26:41.910 --> 01:26:41.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:44.790 --> 01:26:44.800 align:start position:0%
i ask that both of our towns do qualify
 
01:26:46.790 --> 01:26:46.800 align:start position:0%
for our own representative
 
01:26:49.030 --> 01:26:49.040 align:start position:0%
our two towns they have
 
01:26:52.149 --> 01:26:52.159 align:start position:0%
very different needs and concerns
 
01:26:53.510 --> 01:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
they're part of different school
 
01:26:55.830 --> 01:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
districts they don't have a whole lot in
 
01:26:55.840 --> 01:26:56.790 align:start position:0%
districts they don't have a whole lot in
common

01:26:56.790 --> 01:26:56.800 align:start position:0%
common
 
01:26:59.669 --> 01:26:59.679 align:start position:0%
beyond that and like one of the other
 
01:27:02.149 --> 01:27:02.159 align:start position:0%
people said we don't share any
 
01:27:04.790 --> 01:27:04.800 align:start position:0%
public facilities or anything like that
 
01:27:07.590 --> 01:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
um both towns do qualify
 
01:27:09.910 --> 01:27:09.920 align:start position:0%
um and they both qualified in 2010 as
 
01:27:12.790 --> 01:27:12.800 align:start position:0%
well so we have a history of having that
 
01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:16.229 align:start position:0%
well so we have a history of having that
population

01:27:16.229 --> 01:27:16.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:16.239 --> 01:27:17.669 align:start position:0%

01:29:23.270 --> 01:29:23.280 align:start position:0%
victor hello guys
 
01:29:25.030 --> 01:29:25.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming out today and
 
01:29:27.030 --> 01:29:27.040 align:start position:0%
taking time i'm sure you've all got
 
01:29:28.950 --> 01:29:28.960 align:start position:0%
day jobs and responsibilities and here's
 
01:29:31.189 --> 01:29:31.199 align:start position:0%
gotta get another job representing us
 
01:29:33.270 --> 01:29:33.280 align:start position:0%
here at united states
 
01:29:35.990 --> 01:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
i'm from salem
 
01:29:37.270 --> 01:29:37.280 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:29:39.030 --> 01:29:39.040 align:start position:0%
my point just getting getting up to
 
01:29:40.790 --> 01:29:40.800 align:start position:0%
speak is uh
 
01:29:44.229 --> 01:29:44.239 align:start position:0%
that i believe in voting i'm uh i am the
 
01:29:46.390 --> 01:29:46.400 align:start position:0%
the validator in one of the districts
 
01:29:47.990 --> 01:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:29:50.709 --> 01:29:50.719 align:start position:0%
for the last three elections the primary
 
01:29:52.709 --> 01:29:52.719 align:start position:0%
general event of the town
 
01:29:54.950 --> 01:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
um and i fall and volunteered for that
 
01:29:57.030 --> 01:29:57.040 align:start position:0%
because i have firmly believed in voting
 
01:29:59.189 --> 01:29:59.199 align:start position:0%
as one of the things that we can do as
 
01:30:01.510 --> 01:30:01.520 align:start position:0%
americans and i've always believed in
 
01:30:04.629 --> 01:30:04.639 align:start position:0%
that from as a child now here in uh
 
01:30:05.990 --> 01:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
i've been uh given a chance to
 
01:30:07.830 --> 01:30:07.840 align:start position:0%
participate in that
 
01:30:10.390 --> 01:30:10.400 align:start position:0%
so that's the one thing uh
 
01:30:11.990 --> 01:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned i believe in but it is
 
01:30:14.790 --> 01:30:14.800 align:start position:0%
our country has so very little of us
 
01:30:17.110 --> 01:30:17.120 align:start position:0%
we have to pay taxes
 
01:30:19.669 --> 01:30:19.679 align:start position:0%
and they ask that we vote
 
01:30:22.070 --> 01:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
and uh everything else is pretty much
 
01:30:24.629 --> 01:30:24.639 align:start position:0%
voluntary at it after that and um and
 
01:30:26.229 --> 01:30:26.239 align:start position:0%
because i believe in voting we need to
 
01:30:29.270 --> 01:30:29.280 align:start position:0%
make sure that voting remains desirable
 
01:30:31.510 --> 01:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
a function to do something that you want
 
01:30:34.310 --> 01:30:34.320 align:start position:0%
to contribute to and uh and as part of
 
01:30:36.070 --> 01:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
the part of the redistrict as part of
 
01:30:38.310 --> 01:30:38.320 align:start position:0%
the redistricting effort here
 
01:30:40.870 --> 01:30:40.880 align:start position:0%
hopefully that can bring more people in
 
01:30:40.880 --> 01:30:41.590 align:start position:0%
hopefully that can bring more people in
and

01:30:41.590 --> 01:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:30:43.750 --> 01:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
know that their votes do actually count
 
01:30:45.189 --> 01:30:45.199 align:start position:0%
because it is one of the fundamental
 
01:30:47.030 --> 01:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
tenets that makes our country so much
 
01:30:48.629 --> 01:30:48.639 align:start position:0%
different than others around the world
 
01:30:48.639 --> 01:30:49.350 align:start position:0%
different than others around the world
so

01:30:49.350 --> 01:30:49.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:30:50.550 --> 01:30:50.560 align:start position:0%
and there's been many others that have
 
01:30:53.270 --> 01:30:53.280 align:start position:0%
spoken for me here with wonderful points
 
01:30:55.830 --> 01:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
uh all of them i and i can't add
 
01:30:57.830 --> 01:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
to that but this is a bigger broader
 
01:30:59.669 --> 01:30:59.679 align:start position:0%
brighter picture about the importance of
 
01:31:01.590 --> 01:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
general voting in our collective
 
01:31:03.830 --> 01:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
responsibility and really i thank you

01:31:41.350 --> 01:31:41.360 align:start position:0%
members of the committee appreciate your
 
01:31:43.430 --> 01:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
work tonight my name is kevin fleming i
 
01:31:45.590 --> 01:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
live in exeter but i've been teaching
 
01:31:47.430 --> 01:31:47.440 align:start position:0%
government and history for a number of
 
01:31:49.270 --> 01:31:49.280 align:start position:0%
years in hampton
 
01:31:51.430 --> 01:31:51.440 align:start position:0%
and i'd like to go back and
 
01:31:54.470 --> 01:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
recall or release knowledge you've had a
 
01:31:56.470 --> 01:31:56.480 align:start position:0%
number of thoughtful
 
01:31:58.629 --> 01:31:58.639 align:start position:0%
comments and observations tonight
 
01:32:00.709 --> 01:32:00.719 align:start position:0%
but i'd like to go back to the notion
 
01:32:02.470 --> 01:32:02.480 align:start position:0%
maybe in the historical context of
 
01:32:02.480 --> 01:32:04.629 align:start position:0%
maybe in the historical context of
gerrymandering

01:32:04.629 --> 01:32:04.639 align:start position:0%
gerrymandering
 
01:32:05.990 --> 01:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
there is
 
01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:07.110 align:start position:0%
there is
a

01:32:07.110 --> 01:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:32:09.830 --> 01:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
cynicism may i sadly tell you
 
01:32:11.990 --> 01:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
that is in the younger generation that
 
01:32:14.390 --> 01:32:14.400 align:start position:0%
speaks to the notion that money
 
01:32:17.030 --> 01:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
and partisan politics have poisoned the
 
01:32:19.350 --> 01:32:19.360 align:start position:0%
elections and the governing
 
01:32:21.350 --> 01:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
and on that basis
 
01:32:23.669 --> 01:32:23.679 align:start position:0%
may i respectfully request that in your
 
01:32:23.679 --> 01:32:24.629 align:start position:0%
may i respectfully request that in your
work

01:32:24.629 --> 01:32:24.639 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:32:26.950 --> 01:32:26.960 align:start position:0%
you avoid any
 
01:32:29.270 --> 01:32:29.280 align:start position:0%
and all accusation that generating is
 
01:32:29.280 --> 01:32:30.629 align:start position:0%
and all accusation that generating is
continuing

01:32:30.629 --> 01:32:30.639 align:start position:0%
continuing
 
01:32:34.070 --> 01:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
that is the signal that tells folks
 
01:32:36.070 --> 01:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
that things are not fair
 
01:32:37.750 --> 01:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
so we'd like to ask you to be attentive
 
01:32:39.990 --> 01:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
to that to be concerned with that as you
 
01:32:43.350 --> 01:32:43.360 align:start position:0%
probably well are but to be strong and
 
01:32:44.709 --> 01:32:44.719 align:start position:0%
to be fair
 
01:32:48.709 --> 01:32:48.719 align:start position:0%
and to avoid any accusations thank you
 
01:32:50.550 --> 01:32:50.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for your comments also signed
 
01:32:52.070 --> 01:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
up to speak tonight with representative
 
01:33:07.830 --> 01:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:09.510 --> 01:33:09.520 align:start position:0%
thank you good evening
 
01:33:12.390 --> 01:33:12.400 align:start position:0%
and uh thank you all for dedicating
 
01:33:15.189 --> 01:33:15.199 align:start position:0%
your time and talents to our state your
 
01:33:17.669 --> 01:33:17.679 align:start position:0%
efforts to be here in rockingham county
 
01:33:19.350 --> 01:33:19.360 align:start position:0%
tonight i know some of you have traveled
 
01:33:21.110 --> 01:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
a great distance
 
01:33:23.430 --> 01:33:23.440 align:start position:0%
are much appreciated
 
01:33:25.350 --> 01:33:25.360 align:start position:0%
i'll start by saying that these public
 
01:33:25.360 --> 01:33:26.629 align:start position:0%
i'll start by saying that these public
hearings

01:33:26.629 --> 01:33:26.639 align:start position:0%
hearings
 
01:33:29.110 --> 01:33:29.120 align:start position:0%
should be accessible to those who cannot
 
01:33:30.950 --> 01:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
attend in person
 
01:33:33.110 --> 01:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
and the public needs the ability to
 
01:33:36.390 --> 01:33:36.400 align:start position:0%
testify remotely via reassumed
 
01:33:38.790 --> 01:33:38.800 align:start position:0%
had that opportunity been afforded
 
01:33:41.750 --> 01:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
tonight i would be testifying via zoom
 
01:33:43.270 --> 01:33:43.280 align:start position:0%
i understand this might not have been
 
01:33:45.669 --> 01:33:45.679 align:start position:0%
the decision of the committee and lies
 
01:33:48.149 --> 01:33:48.159 align:start position:0%
within the purview of the speaker the
 
01:33:50.470 --> 01:33:50.480 align:start position:0%
honorable sherman packard seeing as this
 
01:33:52.149 --> 01:33:52.159 align:start position:0%
committee is chaired by and has a
 
01:33:54.070 --> 01:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
majority of members from
 
01:33:56.629 --> 01:33:56.639 align:start position:0%
the speaker's party i would urge you to
 
01:33:58.870 --> 01:33:58.880 align:start position:0%
use that to your advantage and to our
 
01:34:00.390 --> 01:34:00.400 align:start position:0%
advantage and encourage a more
 
01:34:02.790 --> 01:34:02.800 align:start position:0%
accessible hearing format
 
01:34:06.149 --> 01:34:06.159 align:start position:0%
eight days ago here in rockingham county
 
01:34:08.310 --> 01:34:08.320 align:start position:0%
the county convention met in person like
 
01:34:08.320 --> 01:34:09.110 align:start position:0%
the county convention met in person like
this

01:34:09.110 --> 01:34:09.120 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:34:11.189 --> 01:34:11.199 align:start position:0%
without a remote option and similar to
 
01:34:11.199 --> 01:34:12.310 align:start position:0%
without a remote option and similar to
tonight

01:34:12.310 --> 01:34:12.320 align:start position:0%
tonight
 
01:34:13.990 --> 01:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
many people have chosen not to wear
 
01:34:16.830 --> 01:34:16.840 align:start position:0%
masks to mitigate the spread of covet
 
01:34:19.830 --> 01:34:19.840 align:start position:0%
19. that night nearly 60 people the
 
01:34:23.030 --> 01:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
majority elderly were exposed
 
01:34:24.550 --> 01:34:24.560 align:start position:0%
there are members of the rockingham
 
01:34:26.550 --> 01:34:26.560 align:start position:0%
county convention whose health is too
 
01:34:28.790 --> 01:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
fragile to risk infection
 
01:34:30.950 --> 01:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
and they should not be excluded from
 
01:34:30.960 --> 01:34:32.790 align:start position:0%
and they should not be excluded from
participation

01:34:32.790 --> 01:34:32.800 align:start position:0%
participation
 
01:34:34.629 --> 01:34:34.639 align:start position:0%
there are members of my community of
 
01:34:37.270 --> 01:34:37.280 align:start position:0%
stratum who also express interest in
 
01:34:41.030 --> 01:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
participation but are of fragile health
 
01:34:43.350 --> 01:34:43.360 align:start position:0%
and though and they thought at least
 
01:34:45.430 --> 01:34:45.440 align:start position:0%
they would be able to watch the live
 
01:34:51.109 --> 01:34:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:53.030 --> 01:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
in 2019
 
01:34:55.669 --> 01:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
my town of stratham along with 30 other
 
01:34:57.510 --> 01:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
towns that year
 
01:34:59.830 --> 01:34:59.840 align:start position:0%
voted at our annual town meeting on a
 
01:35:02.550 --> 01:35:02.560 align:start position:0%
warrant article stating that we support
 
01:35:04.950 --> 01:35:04.960 align:start position:0%
and demand an independent redistricting
 
01:35:04.960 --> 01:35:06.149 align:start position:0%
and demand an independent redistricting
commission

01:35:06.149 --> 01:35:06.159 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:35:07.750 --> 01:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
that was an idea that was supported
 
01:35:09.590 --> 01:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
statewide passed the house and the
 
01:35:12.149 --> 01:35:12.159 align:start position:0%
senate only to be vetoed by the governor
 
01:35:14.149 --> 01:35:14.159 align:start position:0%
last year there are many of you on this
 
01:35:17.750 --> 01:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
committee commissioned tonight who voted
 
01:35:19.510 --> 01:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
for that independent redistricting
 
01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:20.870 align:start position:0%
for that independent redistricting
commission

01:35:20.870 --> 01:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:35:22.629 --> 01:35:22.639 align:start position:0%
but we don't have that
 
01:35:24.550 --> 01:35:24.560 align:start position:0%
and we find ourselves in the exact
 
01:35:26.870 --> 01:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
position we had all worked so
 
01:35:30.629 --> 01:35:30.639 align:start position:0%
strenuously to avoid a partisan process
 
01:35:33.109 --> 01:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
but we must embrace this process with an
 
01:35:34.870 --> 01:35:34.880 align:start position:0%
eye on fairness
 
01:35:37.270 --> 01:35:37.280 align:start position:0%
in our map drawing and to avoid the
 
01:35:40.149 --> 01:35:40.159 align:start position:0%
siren song of people who crow about
 
01:35:42.950 --> 01:35:42.960 align:start position:0%
redrawing the maps to give their party a
 
01:35:45.430 --> 01:35:45.440 align:start position:0%
geographical advantage
 
01:35:47.669 --> 01:35:47.679 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the voters of stratum i
 
01:35:49.510 --> 01:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
respectfully ask this committee to
 
01:35:51.350 --> 01:35:51.360 align:start position:0%
consider the following
 
01:35:53.830 --> 01:35:53.840 align:start position:0%
as voters and citizens we have common
 
01:35:55.510 --> 01:35:55.520 align:start position:0%
interests with our neighbors
 
01:35:58.149 --> 01:35:58.159 align:start position:0%
particularly with school districts
 
01:35:59.830 --> 01:35:59.840 align:start position:0%
and public services where they are
 
01:35:59.840 --> 01:36:00.870 align:start position:0%
and public services where they are
shared

01:36:00.870 --> 01:36:00.880 align:start position:0%
shared
 
01:36:03.430 --> 01:36:03.440 align:start position:0%
we ask that the maps reflect that and
 
01:36:05.510 --> 01:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
not break up school districts over
 
01:36:07.750 --> 01:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
multiple voting districts and that they
 
01:36:09.910 --> 01:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
be grouped together to mirror our
 
01:36:09.920 --> 01:36:11.270 align:start position:0%
be grouped together to mirror our
communities

01:36:11.270 --> 01:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
communities
 
01:36:13.030 --> 01:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
we understand that according we
 
01:36:14.950 --> 01:36:14.960 align:start position:0%
understand in stratham that according to
 
01:36:17.030 --> 01:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
the latest census data we will be
 
01:36:19.350 --> 01:36:19.360 align:start position:0%
allotted our two representatives
 
01:36:21.590 --> 01:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
and have representation most likely with
 
01:36:24.310 --> 01:36:24.320 align:start position:0%
another plotarial representative
 
01:36:26.390 --> 01:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
we ask that that remain within our
 
01:36:28.390 --> 01:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
school district
 
01:36:30.709 --> 01:36:30.719 align:start position:0%
here in rockingham county there have
 
01:36:33.270 --> 01:36:33.280 align:start position:0%
been changes
 
01:36:35.350 --> 01:36:35.360 align:start position:0%
in populations to the towns of
 
01:36:37.669 --> 01:36:37.679 align:start position:0%
nottingham deerfield
 
01:36:41.669 --> 01:36:41.679 align:start position:0%
candia auburn chester atkinson plaistow
 
01:36:44.229 --> 01:36:44.239 align:start position:0%
hampstead sandown kingston
 
01:36:47.990 --> 01:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
new market seabrook greenland and rye
 
01:36:50.149 --> 01:36:50.159 align:start position:0%
they should each have their own
 
01:36:53.430 --> 01:36:53.440 align:start position:0%
dedicated districts in this round
 
01:36:55.189 --> 01:36:55.199 align:start position:0%
we ask that a correction to the
 
01:36:57.750 --> 01:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
executive council map be executed by
 
01:36:59.030 --> 01:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
01:37:02.229 --> 01:37:02.239 align:start position:0%
the district 2 as it is known the dragon
 
01:37:05.030 --> 01:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
district is nothing short of ridiculous
 
01:37:07.590 --> 01:37:07.600 align:start position:0%
and cynically drawn in its geographical
 
01:37:07.600 --> 01:37:08.790 align:start position:0%
and cynically drawn in its geographical
scope

01:37:08.790 --> 01:37:08.800 align:start position:0%
scope
 
01:37:11.669 --> 01:37:11.679 align:start position:0%
it is a poor reflection on us as a state
 
01:37:13.669 --> 01:37:13.679 align:start position:0%
that it was gerrymandered in that way
 
01:37:16.709 --> 01:37:16.719 align:start position:0%
and we can do better
 
01:37:19.189 --> 01:37:19.199 align:start position:0%
why the cities of rochester somersworth
 
01:37:21.510 --> 01:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
dover and the towns of durham madbury
 
01:37:23.990 --> 01:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
and rollinsburg are not in our district
 
01:37:26.390 --> 01:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
is a 10 year old mystery perhaps this
 
01:37:29.350 --> 01:37:29.360 align:start position:0%
committee can solve that
 
01:37:31.590 --> 01:37:31.600 align:start position:0%
we ask that the congressional map be
 
01:37:34.390 --> 01:37:34.400 align:start position:0%
reflective of the competitiveness
 
01:37:36.629 --> 01:37:36.639 align:start position:0%
that the maps have now
 
01:37:38.790 --> 01:37:38.800 align:start position:0%
there have been only nominal changes in
 
01:37:40.709 --> 01:37:40.719 align:start position:0%
the populations of those current
 
01:37:43.030 --> 01:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
districts and there should not be any
 
01:37:45.350 --> 01:37:45.360 align:start position:0%
drastic changes like the often bandied
 
01:37:47.430 --> 01:37:47.440 align:start position:0%
about idea
 
01:37:50.310 --> 01:37:50.320 align:start position:0%
of the rumored carving out of manchester
 
01:37:52.709 --> 01:37:52.719 align:start position:0%
and allotting it to district 2. that
 
01:37:55.109 --> 01:37:55.119 align:start position:0%
would be unacceptable
 
01:37:57.750 --> 01:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
and as for transparency the public needs
 
01:38:00.310 --> 01:38:00.320 align:start position:0%
more notice for these public meetings
 
01:38:02.229 --> 01:38:02.239 align:start position:0%
and as i mentioned at the beginning they
 
01:38:05.430 --> 01:38:05.440 align:start position:0%
need to be accessible to everyone
 
01:38:07.030 --> 01:38:07.040 align:start position:0%
and finally
 
01:38:08.709 --> 01:38:08.719 align:start position:0%
the minute the map
 
01:38:11.669 --> 01:38:11.679 align:start position:0%
the draft maps are finished
 
01:38:13.990 --> 01:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
we need to have digital digital
 
01:38:17.189 --> 01:38:17.199 align:start position:0%
accessibility the public needs digital
 
01:38:20.629 --> 01:38:20.639 align:start position:0%
accessibility to those draft maps
 
01:38:24.149 --> 01:38:24.159 align:start position:0%
and we ask you to please come back here
 
01:38:26.950 --> 01:38:26.960 align:start position:0%

an opportunity for the public to put
 
01:38:37.189 --> 01:38:37.199 align:start position:0%
input into your work product

i really thank you for your time and
 
01:38:41.350 --> 01:38:41.360 align:start position:0%
dedication to this laborious task that
 
01:38:43.990 --> 01:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
will either produce manipulative maps
 
01:38:45.990 --> 01:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
that reflect the ideologies of a
 
01:38:47.510 --> 01:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
singular party
 
01:38:47.520 --> 01:38:48.550 align:start position:0%
singular party
or

01:38:48.550 --> 01:38:48.560 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:38:50.229 --> 01:38:50.239 align:start position:0%
fair maps
 
01:38:52.310 --> 01:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
fair maps that reflect the true new
 
01:38:55.350 --> 01:38:55.360 align:start position:0%

thank you i'll email my testimony to you
 
01:39:01.830 --> 01:39:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:03.750 --> 01:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else here tonight who
 
01:39:19.910 --> 01:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:21.430 --> 01:39:21.440 align:start position:0%
i want to thank you all for coming to
 
01:39:23.270 --> 01:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
redwood so that we have a chance to
 
01:39:25.350 --> 01:39:25.360 align:start position:0%
speak to you tonight
 
01:39:27.830 --> 01:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of being quick
 
01:39:29.990 --> 01:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
two points i'd like to do this thanks
 
01:39:31.270 --> 01:39:31.280 align:start position:0%
today tonight
 
01:39:33.350 --> 01:39:33.360 align:start position:0%
it seems to me
 
01:39:35.669 --> 01:39:35.679 align:start position:0%
that having a representative in your
 
01:39:37.990 --> 01:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
town if you have the population is one
 
01:39:50.390 --> 01:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:51.830 --> 01:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
in terms of having
 
01:39:53.590 --> 01:39:53.600 align:start position:0%
a real opportunity to have someone speak
 
01:39:55.350 --> 01:39:55.360 align:start position:0%
just before your deal when they have the
 
01:39:58.310 --> 01:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
population that is constitutionally
 
01:40:01.430 --> 01:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:03.590 --> 01:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
but do we hope that you will do that the
 
01:40:06.390 --> 01:40:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:09.030 --> 01:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
i don't know how maybe written something
 
01:40:11.270 --> 01:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
but you know the first round
 
01:40:13.350 --> 01:40:13.360 align:start position:0%
could only do a good set of eyes to look
 
01:40:15.669 --> 01:40:15.679 align:start position:0%
at it
 
01:40:15.679 --> 01:40:17.189 align:start position:0%
at it
so

01:40:17.189 --> 01:40:17.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:40:20.550 --> 01:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
let people see that first draft
 
01:40:23.189 --> 01:40:23.199 align:start position:0%
and get that feedback
 
01:40:23.199 --> 01:40:24.470 align:start position:0%
and get that feedback
because

01:40:24.470 --> 01:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:40:26.950 --> 01:40:26.960 align:start position:0%
we've heard a lot about gerrymandering
 
01:40:28.790 --> 01:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
if we're really addressing that issue
 
01:40:30.870 --> 01:40:30.880 align:start position:0%
we're being fair
 
01:40:33.189 --> 01:40:33.199 align:start position:0%
then that first draft
 
01:40:39.270 --> 01:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:40.470 --> 01:40:40.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:40:42.390 --> 01:40:42.400 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who'd like to speak
 
01:40:44.310 --> 01:40:44.320 align:start position:0%
i see a couple of hands i i believe you
 
01:40:46.390 --> 01:40:46.400 align:start position:0%
spoke earlier let me recognize the woman
 
01:40:47.669 --> 01:40:47.679 align:start position:0%
in the battle who i don't think has
 
01:40:54.149 --> 01:40:54.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:55.669 --> 01:40:55.679 align:start position:0%
hi good evening
 
01:40:57.990 --> 01:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
my name is catherine haraki um i live in
 
01:40:58.000 --> 01:40:59.030 align:start position:0%
my name is catherine haraki um i live in
hampton

01:40:59.030 --> 01:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
hampton
 
01:41:00.310 --> 01:41:00.320 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry could you give us your name
 
01:41:02.470 --> 01:41:02.480 align:start position:0%
again katherine rocky i live in hampton
 
01:41:03.990 --> 01:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
i had to write this down as
 
01:41:06.629 --> 01:41:06.639 align:start position:0%
congressional district 1 senate district
 
01:41:10.470 --> 01:41:10.480 align:start position:0%
24 house district 21 executive council
 
01:41:12.950 --> 01:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
district 3. so um
 
01:41:15.350 --> 01:41:15.360 align:start position:0%
quickly when i ran for office for the
 
01:41:17.990 --> 01:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
first time last spring i had to call the
 
01:41:19.669 --> 01:41:19.679 align:start position:0%
state i had to call the secretary of
 
01:41:22.629 --> 01:41:22.639 align:start position:0%
state and ask do i really have to put my
 
01:41:24.709 --> 01:41:24.719 align:start position:0%
street address my personal address on
 
01:41:27.830 --> 01:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
all my um on all my signs that i put on
 
01:41:29.910 --> 01:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
the public i thought that was kind of
 
01:41:31.990 --> 01:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
made me a little uncomfortable and the
 
01:41:34.070 --> 01:41:34.080 align:start position:0%
secretary told me well that is the
 
01:41:37.109 --> 01:41:37.119 align:start position:0%
regulation um it's from a remnant
 
01:41:38.310 --> 01:41:38.320 align:start position:0%
in time
 
01:41:40.709 --> 01:41:40.719 align:start position:0%
when we expected our constituents to
 
01:41:42.950 --> 01:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
come to our front porch and talk about
 
01:41:42.960 --> 01:41:44.470 align:start position:0%
come to our front porch and talk about
issues

01:41:44.470 --> 01:41:44.480 align:start position:0%
issues
 
01:41:46.470 --> 01:41:46.480 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:41:49.030 --> 01:41:49.040 align:start position:0%
the front approach is no longer
 
01:41:51.510 --> 01:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
uh the main source of communication
 
01:41:54.149 --> 01:41:54.159 align:start position:0%
between elect between you and your
 
01:41:57.590 --> 01:41:57.600 align:start position:0%
constituents and um neither should a
 
01:42:00.310 --> 01:42:00.320 align:start position:0%
close one like this
 
01:42:03.350 --> 01:42:03.360 align:start position:0%
so i think please when you go ahead and
 
01:42:06.390 --> 01:42:06.400 align:start position:0%
talk about the next steps keep in mind
 
01:42:07.990 --> 01:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
what are you doing
 
01:42:09.990 --> 01:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
are you doing it because it's a remnant
 
01:42:12.149 --> 01:42:12.159 align:start position:0%
of something in the past
 
01:42:14.550 --> 01:42:14.560 align:start position:0%
and what is your real goal
 
01:42:16.229 --> 01:42:16.239 align:start position:0%
and we have a lot of tools we have
 
01:42:18.950 --> 01:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
telephones we have zoom we have email we
 
01:42:21.430 --> 01:42:21.440 align:start position:0%
have two-way communication lots of other
 
01:42:23.750 --> 01:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
options besides front porches
 
01:42:40.830 --> 01:42:40.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:43.109 --> 01:42:43.119 align:start position:0%
um so i
 
01:42:44.629 --> 01:42:44.639 align:start position:0%
got involved with this sort of as i'm an
 
01:42:47.590 --> 01:42:47.600 align:start position:0%
independent voter uh worried about
 
01:42:49.910 --> 01:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
where democracy is going and you've
 
01:42:51.669 --> 01:42:51.679 align:start position:0%
heard all the stuff but i think the main
 
01:42:53.669 --> 01:42:53.679 align:start position:0%
points i wanted to make but my main
 
01:42:54.950 --> 01:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
thing was
 
01:42:56.629 --> 01:42:56.639 align:start position:0%
how much i learned working with open
 
01:42:59.270 --> 01:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
democracy on trying to draw some maps
 
01:43:00.629 --> 01:43:00.639 align:start position:0%
that looked fair
 
01:43:03.830 --> 01:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
and how much the devil's in the details
 
01:43:03.840 --> 01:43:04.790 align:start position:0%
and how much the devil's in the details
and

01:43:04.790 --> 01:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:43:06.470 --> 01:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
i felt that was a pretty educated voter
 
01:43:08.790 --> 01:43:08.800 align:start position:0%
and then i realized how much i wasn't
 
01:43:11.350 --> 01:43:11.360 align:start position:0%
and i think that's all the more reason
 
01:43:12.950 --> 01:43:12.960 align:start position:0%
why it's going to be really important
 
01:43:15.270 --> 01:43:15.280 align:start position:0%
that when these maps are drawn
 
01:43:17.430 --> 01:43:17.440 align:start position:0%
initially they are shown to people
 
01:43:19.109 --> 01:43:19.119 align:start position:0%
and someone explained it as much as they
 
01:43:21.430 --> 01:43:21.440 align:start position:0%
can to me the most important thing
 
01:43:23.669 --> 01:43:23.679 align:start position:0%
is that the districts are competitive
 
01:43:25.109 --> 01:43:25.119 align:start position:0%
at the congressional level the executive
 
01:43:25.119 --> 01:43:26.149 align:start position:0%
at the congressional level the executive
council

01:43:26.149 --> 01:43:26.159 align:start position:0%
council
 
01:43:28.070 --> 01:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
all those and to be honest the 2010s
 
01:43:30.790 --> 01:43:30.800 align:start position:0%
actually had that fairly competitive
 
01:43:32.390 --> 01:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
across the board that's something i
 
01:43:34.310 --> 01:43:34.320 align:start position:0%
certainly want to see maintain
 
01:43:37.350 --> 01:43:37.360 align:start position:0%
and i think the more this can be out
 
01:43:38.950 --> 01:43:38.960 align:start position:0%
there and shown to the public and i
 
01:43:41.109 --> 01:43:41.119 align:start position:0%
appreciate having this listening session
 
01:43:42.629 --> 01:43:42.639 align:start position:0%
i think that's going to help new
 
01:43:45.590 --> 01:43:45.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire voters stay involved and i
 
01:43:47.910 --> 01:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
hope that you'll strongly consider
 
01:43:49.189 --> 01:43:49.199 align:start position:0%
having the maps once they're
 
01:43:51.109 --> 01:43:51.119 align:start position:0%
preliminarily drawn for at least some
 
01:43:52.629 --> 01:43:52.639 align:start position:0%
type of comment i know it's a lot of
 
01:43:54.709 --> 01:43:54.719 align:start position:0%
time energy and resources
 
01:43:56.950 --> 01:43:56.960 align:start position:0%
to do it again but i think
 
01:43:59.109 --> 01:43:59.119 align:start position:0%
it may help get more people involved
 
01:44:00.870 --> 01:44:00.880 align:start position:0%
which is what we need to do so thanks
 
01:44:02.070 --> 01:44:02.080 align:start position:0%
for your time
 
01:44:04.310 --> 01:44:04.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for your comments
 
01:44:06.229 --> 01:44:06.239 align:start position:0%
are there other persons here tonight yes
 
01:44:13.270 --> 01:44:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:15.669 --> 01:44:15.679 align:start position:0%
i'm kay galloway i'm from atkinson which
 
01:44:18.149 --> 01:44:18.159 align:start position:0%
is rockingham county district 14 which
 
01:44:21.510 --> 01:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
is comprised of atkinson and plasto
 
01:44:23.830 --> 01:44:23.840 align:start position:0%
i do note that representative noah major
 
01:44:25.750 --> 01:44:25.760 align:start position:0%
is seated behind me but i think he will
 
01:44:27.830 --> 01:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
agree that each of our towns is
 
01:44:30.550 --> 01:44:30.560 align:start position:0%
deserving of its own representative
 
01:44:35.189 --> 01:44:35.199 align:start position:0%
each of our towns is right about 7 000
 
01:44:38.390 --> 01:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
residents and we have about 500 voters
 
01:44:39.669 --> 01:44:39.679 align:start position:0%
in each town
 
01:44:41.030 --> 01:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
i add my
 
01:44:43.750 --> 01:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
voice to those who have echoed it loud
 
01:44:46.070 --> 01:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
and clear that we need
 
01:44:48.149 --> 01:44:48.159 align:start position:0%
independent districts if we've met the
 
01:44:51.510 --> 01:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
criteria thank you for your time
 
01:44:53.430 --> 01:44:53.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for
 
01:44:56.629 --> 01:44:56.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:58.870 --> 01:44:58.880 align:start position:0%
is there anybody else today
 
01:44:58.880 --> 01:45:06.950 align:start position:0%
is there anybody else today
so

01:45:06.950 --> 01:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:08.870 --> 01:45:08.880 align:start position:0%
i also want to thank you all for being
 
01:45:14.950 --> 01:45:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:17.430 --> 01:45:17.440 align:start position:0%
house and the um district
 
01:45:19.270 --> 01:45:19.280 align:start position:0%
i guess my point and maybe it sounds a
 
01:45:21.990 --> 01:45:22.000 align:start position:0%
little technical but um
 
01:45:24.149 --> 01:45:24.159 align:start position:0%
that i totally agree with the idea
 
01:45:25.910 --> 01:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
better put forth about keeping school
 
01:45:28.790 --> 01:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
districts together about trying to keep
 
01:45:31.350 --> 01:45:31.360 align:start position:0%
demographics and other groups aligned as
 
01:45:31.360 --> 01:45:32.550 align:start position:0%
demographics and other groups aligned as
possible

01:45:32.550 --> 01:45:32.560 align:start position:0%
possible
 
01:45:34.310 --> 01:45:34.320 align:start position:0%
um you know while balancing the equal
 
01:45:36.390 --> 01:45:36.400 align:start position:0%
representation um
 
01:45:39.510 --> 01:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
and i also agree that it's almost
 
01:45:41.430 --> 01:45:41.440 align:start position:0%
impossible to know what makes town
 
01:45:41.440 --> 01:45:42.830 align:start position:0%
impossible to know what makes town
similar

01:45:42.830 --> 01:45:42.840 align:start position:0%
similar
 
01:45:45.910 --> 01:45:45.920 align:start position:0%
um i guess my one thought would be and
 
01:45:48.790 --> 01:45:48.800 align:start position:0%
uh i my working world use gis a lot i
 
01:45:52.070 --> 01:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
assume that'll be a gis based project
 
01:45:54.070 --> 01:45:54.080 align:start position:0%
that underlies this process
 
01:45:54.080 --> 01:45:55.030 align:start position:0%
that underlies this process
um

01:45:55.030 --> 01:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:57.189 --> 01:45:57.199 align:start position:0%
rather than making the maps themselves
 
01:45:58.709 --> 01:45:58.719 align:start position:0%
the final results
 
01:46:00.470 --> 01:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
available i think it would be great if
 
01:46:02.390 --> 01:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
you could make the
 
01:46:04.390 --> 01:46:04.400 align:start position:0%
underlying data that's going into these
 
01:46:05.590 --> 01:46:05.600 align:start position:0%
all the elements that are being
 
01:46:07.830 --> 01:46:07.840 align:start position:0%
considered available to people in a
 
01:46:10.830 --> 01:46:10.840 align:start position:0%
format that they can look at
 
01:46:12.229 --> 01:46:12.239 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:46:13.430 --> 01:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:46:15.030 --> 01:46:15.040 align:start position:0%
come to their own conclusions based on
 
01:46:16.950 --> 01:46:16.960 align:start position:0%
the same elements that that you're going
 
01:46:17.990 --> 01:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
to consider
 
01:46:19.990 --> 01:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
in the end and then in the end um that
 
01:46:21.910 --> 01:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
the districts that are created
 
01:46:24.390 --> 01:46:24.400 align:start position:0%
um to the degree that it's possible
 
01:46:26.470 --> 01:46:26.480 align:start position:0%
reflect all those aggregated statistics
 
01:46:28.470 --> 01:46:28.480 align:start position:0%
that went into it so people can see the
 
01:46:30.310 --> 01:46:30.320 align:start position:0%
end result and so
 
01:46:32.149 --> 01:46:32.159 align:start position:0%
the feedback that they give which again
 
01:46:34.149 --> 01:46:34.159 align:start position:0%
i also agree the second round would
 
01:46:34.159 --> 01:46:35.189 align:start position:0%
i also agree the second round would
break

01:46:35.189 --> 01:46:35.199 align:start position:0%
break
 
01:46:35.199 --> 01:46:36.070 align:start position:0%
break
um

01:46:36.070 --> 01:46:36.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:37.910 --> 01:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
that that feedback can be based on the
 
01:46:40.790 --> 01:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
same elements that you're working on
 
01:46:43.590 --> 01:46:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:45.510 --> 01:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
anybody else here chad
 
01:46:45.520 --> 01:46:53.030 align:start position:0%
anybody else here chad
vancouver

01:46:53.030 --> 01:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:54.709 --> 01:46:54.719 align:start position:0%
excuse me thank you i just thought of
 
01:46:56.229 --> 01:46:56.239 align:start position:0%
one more thing if you just want to say
 
01:46:57.350 --> 01:46:57.360 align:start position:0%
your name again
 
01:46:59.990 --> 01:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
virginia thanks from canada
 
01:47:02.070 --> 01:47:02.080 align:start position:0%
um i was just thinking as the last
 
01:47:05.350 --> 01:47:05.360 align:start position:0%
person spoke of how confusing it is when
 
01:47:07.430 --> 01:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
you try to align and look at the
 
01:47:09.590 --> 01:47:09.600 align:start position:0%
districts that you're in for
 
01:47:12.790 --> 01:47:12.800 align:start position:0%
representative and senate and executive
 
01:47:15.430 --> 01:47:15.440 align:start position:0%
council and the confusing ways that they
 
01:47:17.270 --> 01:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
don't overlap
 
01:47:17.280 --> 01:47:18.470 align:start position:0%
don't overlap
so

01:47:18.470 --> 01:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:47:20.470 --> 01:47:20.480 align:start position:0%
i know that that's more
 
01:47:23.189 --> 01:47:23.199 align:start position:0%
it's a very complex issue but to the
 
01:47:25.750 --> 01:47:25.760 align:start position:0%
extent that they could align better that
 
01:47:27.430 --> 01:47:27.440 align:start position:0%
would really help when
 
01:47:29.590 --> 01:47:29.600 align:start position:0%
just trying to look at elections as a
 
01:47:29.600 --> 01:47:30.550 align:start position:0%
just trying to look at elections as a
whole

01:47:30.550 --> 01:47:30.560 align:start position:0%
whole
 
01:47:33.590 --> 01:47:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:37.430 --> 01:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:38.790 --> 01:47:38.800 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
01:47:40.550 --> 01:47:40.560 align:start position:0%
well if that's the case let the record
 
01:47:42.149 --> 01:47:42.159 align:start position:0%
reflect that you have a rockingham
 
01:47:44.070 --> 01:47:44.080 align:start position:0%
county elected official who has actually
 
01:47:45.750 --> 01:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
declined to come to the mic at a
 
01:47:45.760 --> 01:47:47.030 align:start position:0%
declined to come to the mic at a
publication

01:47:47.030 --> 01:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
publication
 
01:47:49.669 --> 01:47:49.679 align:start position:0%
and that in itself is somewhat
 
01:47:52.790 --> 01:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
astonishing oh now
 
01:48:05.430 --> 01:48:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:08.390 --> 01:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
i believe that this is the chair
 
01:48:11.510 --> 01:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
of the rockingham county delegation as
 
01:48:13.430 --> 01:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
i'm correct as well as the chair of the
 
01:48:15.830 --> 01:48:15.840 align:start position:0%
ways and means committee and a very long
 
01:48:15.840 --> 01:48:17.109 align:start position:0%
ways and means committee and a very long
time

01:48:17.109 --> 01:48:17.119 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:48:19.030 --> 01:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
distinguished member of the new
 
01:48:21.189 --> 01:48:21.199 align:start position:0%
hampshire house
 
01:48:23.350 --> 01:48:23.360 align:start position:0%
well thank you for that that might be
 
01:48:24.790 --> 01:48:24.800 align:start position:0%
but we're still on the record so you
 
01:48:27.750 --> 01:48:27.760 align:start position:0%
need to tell us who you are my name is
 
01:48:30.070 --> 01:48:30.080 align:start position:0%
representative norman major i represent
 
01:48:33.750 --> 01:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
the town of atkinson foster thank you
 
01:48:36.070 --> 01:48:36.080 align:start position:0%
and i also as chairman of the county
 
01:48:38.709 --> 01:48:38.719 align:start position:0%
delegation i came here tonight
 
01:48:41.510 --> 01:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
to listen to the testimony
 
01:48:43.430 --> 01:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
and from what i heard
 
01:48:45.590 --> 01:48:45.600 align:start position:0%
this great testimony
 
01:48:46.550 --> 01:48:46.560 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:48:49.990 --> 01:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
a constituent of mine from atkinson
 
01:48:53.910 --> 01:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
okay i agree wholeheartedly with her
 
01:48:56.790 --> 01:48:56.800 align:start position:0%
that we need to make as many single
 
01:48:58.790 --> 01:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
districts as we can
 
01:49:01.109 --> 01:49:01.119 align:start position:0%
so these communities get their
 
01:49:04.390 --> 01:49:04.400 align:start position:0%
representation and they're not swamped
 
01:49:04.400 --> 01:49:05.590 align:start position:0%
representation and they're not swamped
and

01:49:05.590 --> 01:49:05.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:49:07.750 --> 01:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
robbed of their
 
01:49:10.470 --> 01:49:10.480 align:start position:0%
representation by a large community that
 
01:49:11.990 --> 01:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
they may put with
 
01:49:13.189 --> 01:49:13.199 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:49:15.080 --> 01:49:15.090 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:49:15.090 --> 01:49:17.510 align:start position:0%
thank you

[Music]
 
01:49:19.030 --> 01:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
teaming up there
 
01:49:20.790 --> 01:49:20.800 align:start position:0%
anybody else here tonight
 
01:49:22.070 --> 01:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
all right i want to thank you all for
 
01:49:23.669 --> 01:49:23.679 align:start position:0%
coming but before we close up i want to
 
01:49:25.270 --> 01:49:25.280 align:start position:0%
make a couple of announcements first of
 
01:49:27.669 --> 01:49:27.679 align:start position:0%
all this meeting was live streamed
 
01:49:29.830 --> 01:49:29.840 align:start position:0%
and it was working the entire meeting
 
01:49:32.070 --> 01:49:32.080 align:start position:0%
that was verified i don't need to be
 
01:49:33.750 --> 01:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
rude when i was looking at my phone but
 
01:49:35.270 --> 01:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
i'm doing various things which include
 
01:49:37.189 --> 01:49:37.199 align:start position:0%
making sure that things are working
 
01:49:39.270 --> 01:49:39.280 align:start position:0%
because you might suspect that sometimes
 
01:49:41.350 --> 01:49:41.360 align:start position:0%
we have technical difficulties
 
01:49:43.109 --> 01:49:43.119 align:start position:0%
and we need to be aware for this you
 
01:49:44.629 --> 01:49:44.639 align:start position:0%
also heard a lot tonight that people
 
01:49:44.639 --> 01:49:45.430 align:start position:0%
also heard a lot tonight that people
want

01:49:45.430 --> 01:49:45.440 align:start position:0%
want
 
01:49:47.990 --> 01:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh remote access well the reality is you
 
01:49:50.310 --> 01:49:50.320 align:start position:0%
have remote access to the committee
 
01:49:53.510 --> 01:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
members um all of you here or people at
 
01:49:56.149 --> 01:49:56.159 align:start position:0%
home there are websites at the new
 
01:49:58.550 --> 01:49:58.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire general court page
 
01:50:00.629 --> 01:50:00.639 align:start position:0%
on the home page for the general court
 
01:50:02.470 --> 01:50:02.480 align:start position:0%
there is a direct link to both the
 
01:50:04.629 --> 01:50:04.639 align:start position:0%
senate redistricting committee and the
 
01:50:06.950 --> 01:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
house redistricting committee if you
 
01:50:09.350 --> 01:50:09.360 align:start position:0%
choose to go to the various chambers the
 
01:50:10.870 --> 01:50:10.880 align:start position:0%
senator the house
 
01:50:12.790 --> 01:50:12.800 align:start position:0%
we are on the house side the special
 
01:50:15.030 --> 01:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
committee on redistricting and on the
 
01:50:16.790 --> 01:50:16.800 align:start position:0%
senate side here senator gray what is
 
01:50:18.629 --> 01:50:18.639 align:start position:0%
your official title
 
01:50:20.709 --> 01:50:20.719 align:start position:0%
uh for the registering
 
01:50:22.830 --> 01:50:22.840 align:start position:0%
senate special committee on
 
01:50:26.550 --> 01:50:26.560 align:start position:0%
resistance the person who set it up
 
01:50:28.950 --> 01:50:28.960 align:start position:0%
so there are links on the committee
 
01:50:31.750 --> 01:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
sites to each of those committees
 
01:50:33.750 --> 01:50:33.760 align:start position:0%
this is the process you would use to
 
01:50:35.750 --> 01:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
look up any committee
 
01:50:37.910 --> 01:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
and its business at the state house on
 
01:50:39.910 --> 01:50:39.920 align:start position:0%

special committee on redistricting you
 
01:50:44.870 --> 01:50:44.880 align:start position:0%
will get various links there that will
 
01:50:46.629 --> 01:50:46.639 align:start position:0%
allow you to look at the materials we've
 
01:50:48.709 --> 01:50:48.719 align:start position:0%
been provided at committee meetings
 
01:50:51.910 --> 01:50:51.920 align:start position:0%

and you can look and see what people
 
01:51:08.950 --> 01:51:08.960 align:start position:0%
have submitted there are some maps up
 
01:51:11.030 --> 01:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
there right now that people have
 
01:51:13.270 --> 01:51:13.280 align:start position:0%
submitted for consideration for the
 
01:51:13.280 --> 01:51:14.229 align:start position:0%
submitted for consideration for the
committee

01:51:14.229 --> 01:51:14.239 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:51:14.239 --> 01:51:15.030 align:start position:0%

01:51:45.109 --> 01:51:45.119 align:start position:0%
thank you very much madam chair
 
01:51:47.750 --> 01:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
um i have only one question which is i
 
01:51:50.390 --> 01:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
know that our schedule has been somewhat
 
01:51:53.589 --> 01:51:53.599 align:start position:0%
uh disruptive but do you have any idea
 
01:51:56.070 --> 01:51:56.080 align:start position:0%
why we will actually have maps for
 
01:51:58.470 --> 01:51:58.480 align:start position:0%
people to look at
 
01:52:00.390 --> 01:52:00.400 align:start position:0%
there's nothing scheduled right now on
 
01:52:02.390 --> 01:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
that and i as a matter of fact was
 
01:52:04.070 --> 01:52:04.080 align:start position:0%
hoping to hear last week at our meeting
 
01:52:05.589 --> 01:52:05.599 align:start position:0%
that people were working on maps and
 
01:52:07.030 --> 01:52:07.040 align:start position:0%
when they were going to be done and i
 
01:52:08.790 --> 01:52:08.800 align:start position:0%
didn't hear from anybody but we'll be
 
01:52:10.629 --> 01:52:10.639 align:start position:0%
working on that schedule thank you and
 
01:52:12.550 --> 01:52:12.560 align:start position:0%
thank you everybody for coming tonight
 
01:52:15.830 --> 01:52:15.840 align:start position:0%
uh before the before the senate closes
 
01:52:17.910 --> 01:52:17.920 align:start position:0%
their hearing i can't talk to the
 
01:52:20.629 --> 01:52:20.639 align:start position:0%
committee members individually because
 
01:52:24.390 --> 01:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
of rsa 91a and i just wanted to to the
 
01:52:25.669 --> 01:52:25.679 align:start position:0%
senate members
 
01:52:27.990 --> 01:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
that if you look at the maps that were
 
01:52:30.870 --> 01:52:30.880 align:start position:0%
provided by mapathon
 
01:52:30.880 --> 01:52:31.990 align:start position:0%
provided by mapathon
that

01:52:31.990 --> 01:52:32.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:52:33.589 --> 01:52:33.599 align:start position:0%
they make a significant change in
 
01:52:36.070 --> 01:52:36.080 align:start position:0%
manchester into two districts
 
01:52:38.550 --> 01:52:38.560 align:start position:0%
instead of the sharing of the outside
 
01:52:41.189 --> 01:52:41.199 align:start position:0%
communities because i think manchester
 
01:52:44.629 --> 01:52:44.639 align:start position:0%
comes in very close to the ideal number
 
01:52:47.430 --> 01:52:47.440 align:start position:0%
breaking it into two they also break
 
01:52:50.149 --> 01:52:50.159 align:start position:0%
nashua into three districts
 
01:52:52.790 --> 01:52:52.800 align:start position:0%
uh because i believe that you can't
 
01:52:54.870 --> 01:52:54.880 align:start position:0%
really do nashua
 
01:52:57.030 --> 01:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
and get within the right
 
01:52:59.910 --> 01:52:59.920 align:start position:0%
is percentages your plus seven if you
 
01:53:01.990 --> 01:53:02.000 align:start position:0%
you do that and then
 
01:53:05.830 --> 01:53:05.840 align:start position:0%
down into the executive council one
 
01:53:05.840 --> 01:53:07.030 align:start position:0%
down into the executive council one
um

01:53:07.030 --> 01:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:09.430 --> 01:53:09.440 align:start position:0%
they list it as a
 
01:53:09.440 --> 01:53:10.550 align:start position:0%
they list it as a
pro

01:53:10.550 --> 01:53:10.560 align:start position:0%
pro
 
01:53:10.560 --> 01:53:11.430 align:start position:0%
pro
that

01:53:11.430 --> 01:53:11.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:53:11.440 --> 01:53:12.709 align:start position:0%
that
manchester

01:53:12.709 --> 01:53:12.719 align:start position:0%
manchester
 
01:53:14.550 --> 01:53:14.560 align:start position:0%
nashua and concord
 
01:53:17.270 --> 01:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
are all in separate districts where i
 
01:53:19.270 --> 01:53:19.280 align:start position:0%
would think that they would be
 
01:53:21.750 --> 01:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
communities of interest
 
01:53:24.310 --> 01:53:24.320 align:start position:0%
so our first meeting that's a couple of
 
01:53:26.870 --> 01:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
the first things that we will take up
 
01:53:29.030 --> 01:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh and we'll schedule those meetings as
 
01:53:30.790 --> 01:53:30.800 align:start position:0%
soon after we finish
 
01:53:33.189 --> 01:53:33.199 align:start position:0%
the hearings if one of them like belnap
 
01:53:35.990 --> 01:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
or whatever hangs out we may actually
 
01:53:38.470 --> 01:53:38.480 align:start position:0%
have a meeting before that but again
 
01:53:40.629 --> 01:53:40.639 align:start position:0%
just senate business so
 
01:53:42.870 --> 01:53:42.880 align:start position:0%
that i've done it in public so
 
01:53:46.070 --> 01:53:46.080 align:start position:0%
i don't violate rsa 91as
 
01:53:48.390 --> 01:53:48.400 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
