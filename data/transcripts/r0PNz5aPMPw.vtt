e

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 align:start position:0%
okay uh we're going to open up the
 
00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
public hearing for the house election
 
00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 align:start position:0%
law committee um we're going to start
 
00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 align:start position:0%
with CA CR2 uh relating to the drawing
 
00:02:54.149 --> 00:02:54.159 align:start position:0%
of District boundaries providing that no
 
00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 align:start position:0%
District boundaries shall be uh drawn in
 
00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 align:start position:0%
any way that favors or disfavors any
 
00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 align:start position:0%
political party candidate um before we
 
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 align:start position:0%
start off uh today's this is school
 
00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 align:start position:0%
vacation week There's No votes today um
 
00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 align:start position:0%
there's 16 17 bills um so normally we
 
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 align:start position:0%
have a two-minute rule with 5minute
 
00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 align:start position:0%
roduction um I'm going to wave that rule
 
00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 align:start position:0%
um provided we stay on time if we start
 
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 align:start position:0%
getting off of schedule I'll I'll kick
 
00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 align:start position:0%
it back on um so I'm basically going to
 
00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 align:start position:0%
make a judgment call based on how many
 
00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 align:start position:0%
bills how many how many uh Pink cards we
 
00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:27.319 align:start position:0%
have and where we are on the calendar so
 
00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:28.879 align:start position:0%
nor for those of you here normally we're
 
00:03:31.149 --> 00:03:31.159 align:start position:0%
here normally get to today you can go
 
00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 align:start position:0%
we've got an hour for these first two
 
00:03:35.589 --> 00:03:35.599 align:start position:0%
redistricting bills um so I don't I
 
00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 align:start position:0%
don't it's okay if cacr 2 bleeds into HB
 
00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 align:start position:0%
363 because I imagine the same people
 
00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
are going to want to talk um but anyway
 
00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 align:start position:0%
so that's where we're going to be today
 
00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
um like I said if we get behind I'll
 
00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 align:start position:0%
kick the rule on um if we don't if we're
 
00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.080 align:start position:0%
doing just fine then we won't with that
 
00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.080 align:start position:0%
um we're going to recognize
 
00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 align:start position:0%
representative Howard for the purpose of
 
00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 align:start position:0%

and today I'm going to be introducing uh
 
00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 align:start position:0%
cacr 2 this constitutional amendment is
 
00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 align:start position:0%
all about the ability uh removing the
 
00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:11.799 align:start position:0%
ability to create partisan political
 
00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 align:start position:0%
maps both the Republican and Democratic
 
00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
parties have used Jerry Mander political
 
00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 align:start position:0%
maps to make it easier for them to gain
 
00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 align:start position:0%
a majority or limit their political
 
00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 align:start position:0%
opponents by limiting the use of certain
 
00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 align:start position:0%
data like voter records party
 
00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 align:start position:0%
registration uh residency information or
 
00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 align:start position:0%
any other proxy uh of that information
 
00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 align:start position:0%
information during the redistricting
 
00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 align:start position:0%
process we remove the politicization of
 
00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
the maps politics should be left to the
 
00:04:38.749 --> 00:04:38.759 align:start position:0%
candidates and the people not datadriven
 
00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:41.639 align:start position:0%
maps which help create predetermined
 
00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 align:start position:0%
outcomes drawing Fair Maps doesn't just
 
00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
make more competitive elections but more
 
00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 align:start position:0%
transparent a more transparent
 
00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:52.039 align:start position:0%
government and responsive government the
 
00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720 align:start position:0%
highly partisan districts created by
 
00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 align:start position:0%
Jerry mandering often see lower voter
 
00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 align:start position:0%
turnout fueled by uh perceived IL
 
00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.720 align:start position:0%
legitimacy or diluted
 
00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 align:start position:0%
representation these districts also
 
00:05:06.749 --> 00:05:06.759 align:start position:0%
encourage extremism in gridlock through
 
00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 align:start position:0%
the election of polarizing ideological
 
00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:11.720 align:start position:0%
candidates and the placement of their of
 
00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:14.039 align:start position:0%
their parties over their
 
00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 align:start position:0%
constituencies we need politicians that
 
00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 align:start position:0%
listen to their constituents first not
 
00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:20.919 align:start position:0%
extremists being dictated by their party
 
00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
and by passing cacr 2 we can guarantee
 
00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120 align:start position:0%
fairness in the redistricting process
 
00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:27.160 align:start position:0%
provide more competitive maps and better
 
00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 align:start position:0%

in support of cacr
 
00:07:06.189 --> 00:07:06.199 align:start position:0%
2 I am not an attorney though I was
 
00:07:08.909 --> 00:07:08.919 align:start position:0%
surrounded by them during my 30 years at
 
00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:11.720 align:start position:0%
the superior court and I saw firsthand
 
00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:14.280 align:start position:0%
the personal commitment of judges to do
 
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
their best through
 
00:07:19.749 --> 00:07:19.759 align:start position:0%
research I type scores of their
 
00:07:22.749 --> 00:07:22.759 align:start position:0%
rulings I am not a legal researcher
 
00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:26.720 align:start position:0%
either so any mistakes spoken here are
 
00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:29.000 align:start position:0%
unintentional my research has allowed me
 
00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:31.240 align:start position:0%
to conclude clude that a legal pattern
 
00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:34.280 align:start position:0%
has been established on the issue of
 
00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:36.680 align:start position:0%
gerrymandering that court rulings turn
 
00:07:38.629 --> 00:07:38.639 align:start position:0%
on whether there is a specific
 
00:07:41.189 --> 00:07:41.199 align:start position:0%
prohibition against Jerry mandering in
 
00:07:44.469 --> 00:07:44.479 align:start position:0%
the respective state constitutions or
 
00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:47.360 align:start position:0%
alternatively whether there is specific
 
00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
language requiring neutrality in
 
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.070 align:start position:0%
language requiring neutrality in
designing

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:51.080 align:start position:0%
designing
 
00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
maps without such specificity courts
 
00:07:56.629 --> 00:07:56.639 align:start position:0%
have determined that the issue at hand
 
00:07:56.639 --> 00:07:58.430 align:start position:0%
have determined that the issue at hand
is

00:07:58.430 --> 00:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:08:00.589 --> 00:08:00.599 align:start position:0%
non-justiciable on that point a New
 
00:08:03.189 --> 00:08:03.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire judge in brown V Secretary of
 
00:08:05.909 --> 00:08:05.919 align:start position:0%

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
Jerry Ming uh violated part one article
 
00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:11.240 align:start position:0%

Constitution indicating that its issue
 
00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:17.400 align:start position:0%
at hand was non-justiciable because in
 
00:08:20.189 --> 00:08:20.199 align:start position:0%
its opinion our constitution does not
 
00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:24.080 align:start position:0%
provide enough specificity to act the
 
00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:26.360 align:start position:0%
case was dismissed on appeal by the New

their

constitutions and I cite with a link the
 
00:08:42.829 --> 00:08:42.839 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire example
 
00:08:46.269 --> 00:08:46.279 align:start position:0%
below Florida New York and Ohio their
 
00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
Supreme Courts have ruled favorably on
 
00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:51.240 align:start position:0%
specific constitutional language similar
 
00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:54.240 align:start position:0%
to the language in this cacr with
 
00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
variations of quote may not be drawn to
 
00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:00.360 align:start position:0%
favor or disfavor and an incumbent or
 
00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
political party end
 
00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:07.640 align:start position:0%
quote the language in cacr 2 puts a f a
 
00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:11.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:15.720 align:start position:0%
it it is very specific no redistricting
 
00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:18.320 align:start position:0%
plan and it uses the word
 
00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:21.480 align:start position:0%
shall which has a specific meaning in
 
00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:25.720 align:start position:0%
law I am confident cacr 2 provides our
 
00:09:28.389 --> 00:09:28.399 align:start position:0%
court with sufficient guidance to
 
00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:32.040 align:start position:0%
prohibit REM mandering in our state I
 
00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:33.760 align:start position:0%
have provided other examples on a
 
00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:36.320 align:start position:0%
separate page of the legal pattern that
 
00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
I see uh has developed though there are
 
00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
many others attached are examples from
 
00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:44.600 align:start position:0%
the states of Alaska Pennsylvania and
 
00:09:46.949 --> 00:09:46.959 align:start position:0%
Florida uh with the North Carolina
 
00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:49.720 align:start position:0%
example and apparent victim of politics
 
00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:52.760 align:start position:0%
with its initial ruling reversed at your
 
00:09:55.509 --> 00:09:55.519 align:start position:0%
request I can provide much more of my uh
 
00:09:58.230 --> 00:09:58.240 align:start position:0%
detailed research amending our
 
00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:00.360 align:start position:0%
constitution is doable
 
00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:03.240 align:start position:0%
it is a matter of will as a living
 
00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
document it has already been amended 27
 
00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
times whether to add or remove content
 
00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
since its Inception in
 
00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:15.800 align:start position:0%
1784 it was amended as recently as 2018
 
00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:19.000 align:start position:0%
at part one article 8 I quote from the
 
00:10:22.389 --> 00:10:22.399 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania Court quote it is a core
 
00:10:25.269 --> 00:10:25.279 align:start position:0%
principle of our form of government that
 
00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:27.800 align:start position:0%
the voters should choose their
 
00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:29.680 align:start position:0%
representatives not the other the way
 
00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:34.200 align:start position:0%
around end quote I urge this body uh to
 
00:10:37.949 --> 00:10:37.959 align:start position:0%
vote OTP thank you thank you will you be
 
00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
taking questions from the committee Mr
 
00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
Perry I will are there questions from
 
00:10:44.949 --> 00:10:44.959 align:start position:0%
the committee saying none thank you next
 
00:10:48.389 --> 00:10:48.399 align:start position:0%
up is Liz tantarelli um and then on Deck
 
00:10:52.949 --> 00:10:52.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:56.629 --> 00:10:56.639 align:start position:0%
Andrews but anyway here we are Norm
 
00:10:59.350 --> 00:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
about cacs
 
00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
primarily because when the question
 
00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:05.320 align:start position:0%
appears on the ballot often the public
 
00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:08.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't understand the wording and
 
00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:10.120 align:start position:0%
that's because it must be written in
 
00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
legal ease and it's not always clear
 
00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:16.200 align:start position:0%
what is added and what is not but I have
 
00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:19.000 align:start position:0%
no reservations whatsoever about this
 
00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.350 align:start position:0%
no reservations whatsoever about this
particular

00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:20.360 align:start position:0%
particular
 
00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:23.800 align:start position:0%
cacr because the wording is so clear in
 
00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:26.680 align:start position:0%
terms of what we're trying to add to the
 
00:11:28.949 --> 00:11:28.959 align:start position:0%
Constitution and we know that many of
 
00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
people many people have spoken in favor
 
00:11:34.949 --> 00:11:34.959 align:start position:0%
of this from both
 
00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
parties um my testimony here is
 
00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:41.240 align:start position:0%
addressed both to the cacr and to
 
00:11:45.389 --> 00:11:45.399 align:start position:0%
36063 when I talk about uh Fair
 
00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:48.720 align:start position:0%
maps and The crucial role that they play
 
00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
in subsequent
 
00:11:52.949 --> 00:11:52.959 align:start position:0%
legislation neither bill says the
 
00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
obvious whichever party is dominant at
 
00:11:57.230 --> 00:11:57.240 align:start position:0%
the time of
 
00:11:59.949 --> 00:11:59.959 align:start position:0%
redistricting will attempt partisan
 
00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:02.360 align:start position:0%
redistricting to their own
 
00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:04.600 align:start position:0%
advantage and we've seen it happen in
 
00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:06.720 align:start position:0%
other states we've seen it here in New
 
00:12:09.069 --> 00:12:09.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire no party is above the
 
00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:11.480 align:start position:0%
temptation to make the next election
 
00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
easier for their own candidates so the
 
00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:17.720 align:start position:0%
graphic that is page two of this
 
00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
testimony um is from uh 2022 but it
 
00:12:25.949 --> 00:12:25.959 align:start position:0%
makes the point that the swing is back
 
00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:29.240 align:start position:0%
and forth between and this is a nation
 
00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
wide statistic this is not a New
 
00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:34.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire graphic um it makes this point
 
00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:36.360 align:start position:0%
visually you know that partisan attempts
 
00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
swing back and forth so members of both
 
00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:42.320 align:start position:0%
parties should be concerned about
 
00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
this um it's true that partisan leanings
 
00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
happen almost naturally in some towns
 
00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:51.680 align:start position:0%
and you move to a town you suddenly
 
00:12:53.949 --> 00:12:53.959 align:start position:0%
realize you're surrounded by members of
 
00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
one particular party that that town
 
00:12:58.790 --> 00:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
always votes that way that's that's a
 
00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
natural phenomenon and it changes over
 
00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
time often uh but it should not be part
 
00:13:08.069 --> 00:13:08.079 align:start position:0%
and should not be considered in
 
00:13:11.509 --> 00:13:11.519 align:start position:0%
redistricting so my ask here is very
 
00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
simple use your ethical standards to say
 
00:13:19.189 --> 00:13:19.199 align:start position:0%
that Maps should be fair do the right
 
00:13:22.269 --> 00:13:22.279 align:start position:0%
thing recommend this bill now so that
 
00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:24.920 align:start position:0%
when we get to 2030 for the next
 
00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:27.320 align:start position:0%
redistricting we'll be able to do it
 
00:13:29.949 --> 00:13:29.959 align:start position:0%
without partisan consideration
 
00:13:32.949 --> 00:13:32.959 align:start position:0%
and the voters deserve that but also
 
00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:35.560 align:start position:0%
your party whichever party it is
 
00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
deserves that as well we have no idea
 
00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:40.160 align:start position:0%
which party might be dominant in
 
00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
2030 and we want to make sure that that
 
00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
process is fair to both parties I'm
 
00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:49.800 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions if there are any
 
00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:52.120 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee seeing none
 
00:13:54.389 --> 00:13:54.399 align:start position:0%
thank you next up is David Andrews and
 
00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:56.560 align:start position:0%
on Deck is marger Porter honorable Mar
 
00:13:56.560 --> 00:14:08.710 align:start position:0%
on Deck is marger Porter honorable Mar
Porter

00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:12.069 --> 00:14:12.079 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:15.880 align:start position:0%
um my name is David Andrews I was a data
 
00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:18.240 align:start position:0%
analyst at the registering data Hub
 
00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:20.600 align:start position:0%
during the 2020 registrating cycle which
 
00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
is a nonpartisan nonprofit
 
00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:25.160 align:start position:0%
organization um I was the lead mapper
 
00:14:26.749 --> 00:14:26.759 align:start position:0%
for the mapathon project right here in
 
00:14:26.759 --> 00:14:27.509 align:start position:0%
for the mapathon project right here in
New

00:14:27.509 --> 00:14:27.519 align:start position:0%
New
 
00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:31.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um and now I'm just here as a
 
00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
redistricting nerd um but looking at
 
00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:38.800 align:start position:0%
these Maps now that we've had kind of
 
00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:41.000 align:start position:0%
two elections on them I think it's very
 
00:14:43.829 --> 00:14:43.839 align:start position:0%
clear that you can see that there is a
 
00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:47.160 align:start position:0%
partisan bias Within These Maps um you
 
00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
look at the state senate the efficiency
 
00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:53.440 align:start position:0%
Gap is around 15% meaning that
 
00:14:56.749 --> 00:14:56.759 align:start position:0%
um the Republican Party win about 15%
 
00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
more districts than they kind of would
 
00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:03.800 align:start position:0%
on a a fair map and it's even worse in
 
00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
the executive Council map where the
 
00:15:08.509 --> 00:15:08.519 align:start position:0%
efficiency Gap is about
 
00:15:08.519 --> 00:15:10.990 align:start position:0%
efficiency Gap is about
26%

00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:11.000 align:start position:0%
26%
 
00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:13.720 align:start position:0%
um this
 
00:15:19.189 --> 00:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
cacr would help um I think both in the
 
00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
registering process by not allowing um
 
00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:27.560 align:start position:0%
you know the data to be used um to draw
 
00:15:29.749 --> 00:15:29.759 align:start position:0%
the maps um
 
00:15:32.949 --> 00:15:32.959 align:start position:0%
and in the judicial process of reviewing
 
00:15:36.949 --> 00:15:36.959 align:start position:0%
these maps and um determining you know
 
00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
whether they can set a standard of fair
 
00:15:45.189 --> 00:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
Maps or not um and so I strongly um
 
00:15:47.069 --> 00:15:47.079 align:start position:0%
testify in favor of this I think it's
 
00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
important to note a few things in the
 
00:15:54.389 --> 00:15:54.399 align:start position:0%
bill um for instance the um it prohibits
 
00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:56.240 align:start position:0%
measures of data to be used in the
 
00:15:59.189 --> 00:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
creation of the map but not the uh analy
 
00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:00.920 align:start position:0%
of the map which is important because I
 
00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:03.800 align:start position:0%
think you know myself or I'm sure
 
00:16:07.189 --> 00:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
representative Barry could draw uh Jerry
 
00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
mandard map just based on our knowledge
 
00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:11.160 align:start position:0%
of voting patterns in the towns we
 
00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:14.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't need the data per se to do that
 
00:16:17.629 --> 00:16:17.639 align:start position:0%
um but we could then use the data to
 
00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:19.680 align:start position:0%
analyze the maps and show you know
 
00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:21.880 align:start position:0%
efficiency gaps and partisan bias and
 
00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:23.600 align:start position:0%
all the other uh parameters that are
 
00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:27.160 align:start position:0%
used in judging whether maps are fair in
 
00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:29.240 align:start position:0%
uh redistricting um another other thing
 
00:16:32.389 --> 00:16:32.399 align:start position:0%
that I think is important to note is the
 
00:16:35.309 --> 00:16:35.319 align:start position:0%
um the segment that says the res
 
00:16:38.069 --> 00:16:38.079 align:start position:0%
residency of the incumbents is important
 
00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:40.040 align:start position:0%
um that it won't take that into account
 
00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
because you know I think in the 2020
 
00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
registering process it was very clear in
 
00:16:47.189 --> 00:16:47.199 align:start position:0%
the Senate it was spoken openly that
 
00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:49.480 align:start position:0%
they were taking into account incumbents
 
00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:51.800 align:start position:0%
and where they lived into their
 
00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
registering process Senate District Four
 
00:16:57.309 --> 00:16:57.319 align:start position:0%
is not Senator Waters Senate District
 
00:16:59.910 --> 00:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
Six is not Senator Grace they are the
 
00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:01.720 align:start position:0%
districts they are the people's
 
00:17:04.789 --> 00:17:04.799 align:start position:0%
districts they are just in those seats
 
00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:09.240 align:start position:0%
um so we should not be drawing districts
 
00:17:13.110 --> 00:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
to um you know favor any incumbent or
 
00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
any other potential
 
00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:19.360 align:start position:0%
candidates um so I just wanted to say uh
 
00:17:21.829 --> 00:17:21.839 align:start position:0%
that I am uh strongly in favor of the
 
00:17:24.949 --> 00:17:24.959 align:start position:0%
CCR let's leave this up to the voters of
 
00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:26.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to decide whether we
 
00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:29.440 align:start position:0%
should have you know Fair Maps or not
 
00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take questions are there
 
00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:32.440 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:33.750 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
representative

00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:33.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:35.960 align:start position:0%
C thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:39.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question um in reading this
 
00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
the two sentences that are added the
 
00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:44.440 align:start position:0%
second sentence tells you not to use any
 
00:17:49.029 --> 00:17:49.039 align:start position:0%
any kind of known data to uh accomplish
 
00:17:49.039 --> 00:17:49.909 align:start position:0%
any kind of known data to uh accomplish
the

00:17:49.909 --> 00:17:49.919 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:53.440 align:start position:0%
first uh sentence so how do we how do we
 
00:17:56.510 --> 00:17:56.520 align:start position:0%
get a district that every time you then
 
00:17:59.750 --> 00:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
go back and look at to see if it is
 
00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:02.600 align:start position:0%
reasonable measuring the data you have
 
00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:04.840 align:start position:0%
to throw it out and start over again
 
00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
yeah so um I drew a lot of maps in the
 
00:18:10.549 --> 00:18:10.559 align:start position:0%
2020 resing process as part of the
 
00:18:10.559 --> 00:18:11.870 align:start position:0%
2020 resing process as part of the
mapathon

00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:11.880 align:start position:0%
mapathon
 
00:18:15.549 --> 00:18:15.559 align:start position:0%
um one and this happened to me I would
 
00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:17.720 align:start position:0%
use um you know communities of Interest
 
00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
we decided on um using like uh shared
 
00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
Water Systems um shared police and fire
 
00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:28.120 align:start position:0%
departments uh High School saus to try
 
00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:30.280 align:start position:0%
to keep districts together and so I
 
00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
would use those data I had like
 
00:18:33.909 --> 00:18:33.919 align:start position:0%
overlapping maps and I would use that
 
00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
data and then I would go back at the end
 
00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
of it and I would check to see what the
 
00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:40.280 align:start position:0%
efficient Gap was what um you know the
 
00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:43.240 align:start position:0%
partisan bias was so that I wasn't using
 
00:18:45.909 --> 00:18:45.919 align:start position:0%
the data in the mapping process but I
 
00:18:48.149 --> 00:18:48.159 align:start position:0%
went back and checked and in one case I
 
00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:52.200 align:start position:0%
had you know unknowingly created a map
 
00:18:55.669 --> 00:18:55.679 align:start position:0%
where it had uh partisan bias towards
 
00:18:57.230 --> 00:18:57.240 align:start position:0%
one of the parties and so I was like all
 
00:18:59.630 --> 00:18:59.640 align:start position:0%
right let's not use that one and so
 
00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
there's you know an infinite amount of
 
00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:05.640 align:start position:0%
possible ways to to draw these Maps so
 
00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:07.280 align:start position:0%
you just have to you know go through the
 
00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:09.960 align:start position:0%
process use those um communities of
 
00:19:11.909 --> 00:19:11.919 align:start position:0%
Interest or whatever is the defining
 
00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
characteristic and then go back and you
 
00:19:15.789 --> 00:19:15.799 align:start position:0%
can check further question of the
 
00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:18.400 align:start position:0%
committee representative um qua I don't
 
00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:24.440 align:start position:0%
your thank you Mr chairman you mentioned
 
00:19:26.789 --> 00:19:26.799 align:start position:0%
communities of Interest how is a
 
00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:29.080 align:start position:0%
political party not a community of
 
00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:31.000 align:start position:0%
interest and why should it be treated
 
00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
differently from any other community of
 
00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:37.080 align:start position:0%
Interest mhm well I think that uh you
 
00:19:39.669 --> 00:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
can treat it as a community of interest
 
00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:43.480 align:start position:0%
if you want to but if you were to do
 
00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:47.080 align:start position:0%
that it would not really be a kind of
 
00:19:50.149 --> 00:19:50.159 align:start position:0%
gerrymander map in the sense that um
 
00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:51.880 align:start position:0%
packing and cracking if you were trying
 
00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
to keep you know Republicans together or
 
00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
Democrats together you would you could
 
00:19:58.990 --> 00:19:59.000 align:start position:0%
do that but then it would honestly lead
 
00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
to a a a fairish map because in the
 
00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:05.480 align:start position:0%
process of gerrymandering you need to
 
00:20:09.549 --> 00:20:09.559 align:start position:0%
pack um you know pack a certain party
 
00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:11.720 align:start position:0%
into some districts and then crack them
 
00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:14.840 align:start position:0%
in other districts so that you have um
 
00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:17.080 align:start position:0%
an unfair balance between the two so if
 
00:20:19.149 --> 00:20:19.159 align:start position:0%
you did treat them as communities of
 
00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
Interest it would naturally um come out
 
00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:23.640 align:start position:0%
to be a more fair
 
00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:27.400 align:start position:0%
map yeah you got follow up yeah follow
 
00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
up so you're saying that um political
 
00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
parties as treated as communities of
 
00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:35.240 align:start position:0%
Interest could result in a fair map yeah
 
00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:38.200 align:start position:0%
you could yeah yeah am I correct in
 
00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:40.440 align:start position:0%
reading this amendment that it would
 
00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:43.640 align:start position:0%
however prohibit that practice um of
 
00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:45.880 align:start position:0%
using a political party is a community
 
00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
of interest for drawing AAP it's using
 
00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
it's it's prohibiting the the data to be
 
00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:52.520 align:start position:0%
used um for
 
00:20:57.470 --> 00:20:57.480 align:start position:0%
that further questions um I have one oh
 
00:20:59.590 --> 00:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
actually represent some you good to go
 
00:21:02.149 --> 00:21:02.159 align:start position:0%
thank you um when you say the community
 
00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:04.840 align:start position:0%
of Interest could create a fair map do
 
00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:07.880 align:start position:0%
you mean if it's used consistently for
 
00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:10.600 align:start position:0%
both parties yes thank
 
00:21:13.789 --> 00:21:13.799 align:start position:0%
you further questions um so my question
 
00:21:15.669 --> 00:21:15.679 align:start position:0%
is you talked about the efficiency Gap
 
00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
what is the efficiency gap on our
 
00:21:19.149 --> 00:21:19.159 align:start position:0%
current Congressional Maps where 47% of
 
00:21:20.789 --> 00:21:20.799 align:start position:0%
the people have been represented 0% of
 
00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
the time uh I think it's
 
00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:28.360 align:start position:0%
a it's about so efficiency Gap is using
 
00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
um um you know
 
00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:33.880 align:start position:0%
unused so I think it's probably I'm not
 
00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:35.440 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure honestly it'd be hard to
 
00:21:38.390 --> 00:21:38.400 align:start position:0%
use a ficient gap on a two District um
 
00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:40.360 align:start position:0%
map in any way
 
00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:46.240 align:start position:0%
qua thank you Mr
 
00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:49.480 align:start position:0%
chairman do you believe that an elected
 
00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
representative who's affiliated with one
 
00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
party cannot fairly represent
 
00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
individuals who are affiliated or
 
00:21:57.950 --> 00:21:57.960 align:start position:0%
sympathies lie with a different
 
00:21:59.549 --> 00:21:59.559 align:start position:0%
political party
 
00:22:03.029 --> 00:22:03.039 align:start position:0%
I would not be able to answer that
 
00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
as further questions representative Lane
 
00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
um I don't have a question but um I
 
00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
understand that the efficiency gap for
 
00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
congressional districts is different
 
00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
than for legislative districts um
 
00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:20.200 align:start position:0%
federally you have to have uh less than
 
00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:23.640 align:start position:0%
1% is the for congressional districts
 
00:22:25.909 --> 00:22:25.919 align:start position:0%
and uh for legislative districts it's
 
00:22:30.110 --> 00:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
less than 10% so Federal Law requires it
 
00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:34.400 align:start position:0%
to be 5050 in Congress by
 
00:22:37.549 --> 00:22:37.559 align:start position:0%
population um yes and it's not it's uh
 
00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
we're off topic here but it's um it's
 
00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
not 1% it's actually perfectly divisible
 
00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:43.480 align:start position:0%
you have to get to closest to zero as
 
00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:44.840 align:start position:0%
possible is actually the standard which
 
00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
is hard to do in New Hampshire when you
 
00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
can't use census blocks um anyways any
 
00:22:51.190 --> 00:22:51.200 align:start position:0%
other questions as we oine and relive
 
00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
The Glory Days of 2021 um seeing none
 
00:22:56.110 --> 00:22:56.120 align:start position:0%
thank you uh next up margerie Porter
 
00:22:57.950 --> 00:22:57.960 align:start position:0%
honorable marger Porter excuse me and
 
00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:10.600 align:start position:0%
esto thank you Mr chair and you can
 
00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
leave the Hun part off of my name next
 
00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:17.400 align:start position:0%
time okay um thank you Mr chair and for
 
00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
uh members of the committee uh my name
 
00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:21.440 align:start position:0%
is marjerie Porter I live in Hillsboro
 
00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
and I'm here today representing the
 
00:23:25.669 --> 00:23:25.679 align:start position:0%
delegates of the New Hampshire together
 
00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
citizens assembly which was held in June
 
00:23:30.190 --> 00:23:30.200 align:start position:0%
and last last time I was here I gave you
 
00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:32.760 align:start position:0%
an overview of how that process worked
 
00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:35.480 align:start position:0%
but a short version is we gathered
 
00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
together 50 people from around the state
 
00:23:40.669 --> 00:23:40.679 align:start position:0%
that were demographically um the same as
 
00:23:42.669 --> 00:23:42.679 align:start position:0%
the state and we asked them they were
 
00:23:45.909 --> 00:23:45.919 align:start position:0%
asked to address the problems of lack of
 
00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
confidence in elections increasing
 
00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
polarization and lack of responsiveness
 
00:23:53.230 --> 00:23:53.240 align:start position:0%
of government to the people they
 
00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
represent and we asked them to find
 
00:23:57.430 --> 00:23:57.440 align:start position:0%
solutions they thought were common
 
00:23:59.870 --> 00:23:59.880 align:start position:0%
ground and everyone could agree with one
 
00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:01.720 align:start position:0%
of the solutions to the problems of
 
00:24:04.029 --> 00:24:04.039 align:start position:0%
polarization and responsiveness of
 
00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:06.240 align:start position:0%
government was the establishment of an
 
00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:08.760 align:start position:0%
independent redistricting commission to
 
00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:12.360 align:start position:0%
keep that process nonpartisan and fair
 
00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:15.720 align:start position:0%
87% of the delegates at that convention
 
00:24:19.390 --> 00:24:19.400 align:start position:0%
supported this solution we support cacr
 
00:24:22.029 --> 00:24:22.039 align:start position:0%
2 because we believe it is one step
 
00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:24.880 align:start position:0%
toward making redistricting fair and
 
00:24:26.789 --> 00:24:26.799 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan and yes I will take
 
00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:28.440 align:start position:0%
questions if you have them other
 
00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee seeing none
 
00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:33.440 align:start position:0%
thank you uh next up is Linda Bundy and
 
00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:36.120 align:start position:0%

00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
testimony today in support of cacr 2 the
 
00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
efficiency gap which measures the extent
 
00:25:17.190 --> 00:25:17.200 align:start position:0%
of partisan Jerry mandering is nearly
 
00:25:20.269 --> 00:25:20.279 align:start position:0%
15% for the Senate 25% for the executive
 
00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:23.120 align:start position:0%
Council and 7% for the house while the
 
00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:25.080 align:start position:0%
house seems lower certain individual
 
00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
districts reach nearly 50% efficiency
 
00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
gaps in favor of of Republicans these
 
00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
totals especially for the Senate were
 
00:25:33.070 --> 00:25:33.080 align:start position:0%
bad enough to Warrant the Princeton

present in redistrict redistricting
 
00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:43.360 align:start position:0%
practices have led towns with virtually
 
00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:45.080 align:start position:0%
nothing in common to find themselves in
 
00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:47.360 align:start position:0%
the same districts this has been the
 
00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
case in Senate District 9 where the
 
00:25:51.630 --> 00:25:51.640 align:start position:0%
towns of Hinsdale and benf Bedford have
 
00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:53.200 align:start position:0%
found themselves lumped together after
 
00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:56.240 align:start position:0%
redistricting in 2022 despite being 50
 
00:25:58.430 --> 00:25:58.440 align:start position:0%

00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
residents from both towns said the new
 
00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:05.200 align:start position:0%

00:26:13.149 --> 00:26:13.159 align:start position:0%
overlooked property values in hensdale
 
00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:15.240 align:start position:0%
are also amongst the lowest in the state
 
00:26:17.029 --> 00:26:17.039 align:start position:0%
while Bedford is among the

highest article 11 of the New Hampshire
 
00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:21.840 align:start position:0%

population of any town or Ward according
 
00:26:26.190 --> 00:26:26.200 align:start position:0%
to the last federal census is within a
 
00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
reasonable deviation from the ideal
 
00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:29.640 align:start position:0%
population for one or more
 
00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:32.080 align:start position:0%

representative to Dober Ward 4 despite
 
00:26:50.029 --> 00:26:50.039 align:start position:0%
it exceeding the ideal population and
 
00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:52.520 align:start position:0%
titling it to one the court saw the

issue of partisan Jerry mandering as
 
00:26:56.710 --> 00:26:56.720 align:start position:0%
non-justiciable deferring it to the
 
00:26:59.230 --> 00:26:59.240 align:start position:0%
legislature for remedy in considering

cacr 2 today this committee stands the
 
00:27:03.789 --> 00:27:03.799 align:start position:0%

contains 62 constitutional violations of
 
00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:40.720 align:start position:0%
this manner I urge you to consider the
 
00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:42.640 align:start position:0%
importance of Integrity in constructing
 
00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:44.640 align:start position:0%
District maps and vote ought to pass on
 
00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:47.120 align:start position:0%
cacr 2 in order to rectify the issue of
 
00:27:49.149 --> 00:27:49.159 align:start position:0%
partisan Jerry mandering and I'll take
 
00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:51.000 align:start position:0%
questions if there are any other
 
00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:52.120 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
00:27:55.389 --> 00:27:55.399 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you um ly
 
00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:02.590 --> 00:28:02.600 align:start position:0%
uh Olivia zinc will be reading a
 
00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:04.320 align:start position:0%
statement by Phil Hatcher did I get that
 
00:28:07.509 --> 00:28:07.519 align:start position:0%
right oh I actually have both Linda and
 
00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:08.480 align:start position:0%
that's probably why I put those cards
 
00:28:10.029 --> 00:28:10.039 align:start position:0%
next to each other it's like I planned
 
00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:12.200 align:start position:0%
it like that for the record good morning
 
00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:14.480 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Olivia zinc um
 
00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:16.000 align:start position:0%
executive director of open democracy and
 
00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
today I'm I'm just um uh reading for two
 
00:28:20.830 --> 00:28:20.840 align:start position:0%
citizens so the first is from Linda
 
00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:24.600 align:start position:0%
Bundy of antrum who supports cacr 2 the
 
00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Constitution tasks the
 
00:28:28.269 --> 00:28:28.279 align:start position:0%
House of Representative that's all of of
 
00:28:31.029 --> 00:28:31.039 align:start position:0%
you um with making a portion M of
 
00:28:31.039 --> 00:28:32.549 align:start position:0%
you um with making a portion M of
represent

00:28:32.549 --> 00:28:32.559 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:34.600 align:start position:0%
Representatives um therefore creating
 
00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
vot voting districts after each federal
 
00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:40.240 align:start position:0%
census however it does not specifically
 
00:28:42.389 --> 00:28:42.399 align:start position:0%
address the redistricting process
 
00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:44.720 align:start position:0%
resulting in boundaries that favor one
 
00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:47.200 align:start position:0%
party over another our executive Council
 
00:28:49.950 --> 00:28:49.960 align:start position:0%
and state senate maps are the most
 
00:28:52.029 --> 00:28:52.039 align:start position:0%
erroneous examples of
 
00:28:54.990 --> 00:28:55.000 align:start position:0%
partisanship by prohibiting District
 
00:28:56.830 --> 00:28:56.840 align:start position:0%
boundaries to be drawn in a way that
 
00:28:58.830 --> 00:28:58.840 align:start position:0%
favors or disfavor
 
00:29:02.549 --> 00:29:02.559 align:start position:0%
any political party or candidate cacr 2
 
00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:04.720 align:start position:0%
establishes a process that values
 
00:29:07.509 --> 00:29:07.519 align:start position:0%
fairness over political maneuvering
 
00:29:10.750 --> 00:29:10.760 align:start position:0%
disallowing partisan data um for
 
00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
creating districts um sets a clear
 
00:29:16.549 --> 00:29:16.559 align:start position:0%
standard neither party should be able to
 
00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
give themselves any advantage cacr
 
00:29:21.630 --> 00:29:21.640 align:start position:0%
addresses this Fair Maps will be ensured
 
00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:24.120 align:start position:0%
um that every person's vote matters and
 
00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
she urges you all to pass on cacr 2 do
 
00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
you to just go directly to Phil fired
 
00:29:34.669 --> 00:29:34.679 align:start position:0%
off okay um so Phil Hatcher um also
 
00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:39.200 align:start position:0%
supports cacr to Phil is from Dover um
 
00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
Phil uh insert inserting this into the
 
00:29:44.389 --> 00:29:44.399 align:start position:0%
Constitution as a goal um for the
 
00:29:46.549 --> 00:29:46.559 align:start position:0%
district maps not to be drawn in a way
 
00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
that favors or disfavors any party
 
00:29:52.470 --> 00:29:52.480 align:start position:0%
political party dis um disregarding
 
00:29:55.710 --> 00:29:55.720 align:start position:0%
concerns of the Supreme Court rule
 
00:29:57.549 --> 00:29:57.559 align:start position:0%
ruling I'm just going to summarize some
 
00:29:59.590 --> 00:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
of Phil says a lot so I urge you to read
 
00:30:02.990 --> 00:30:03.000 align:start position:0%
what Phil writes um although Phil is
 
00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:05.480 align:start position:0%
urging you to pass ought to pass the
 
00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:08.480 align:start position:0%
acr2 he has some ideas to make it better
 
00:30:12.149 --> 00:30:12.159 align:start position:0%
so Phil suggests on page on on line 16
 
00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
of page
 
00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:17.640 align:start position:0%
one um that you could remove the word
 
00:30:20.310 --> 00:30:20.320 align:start position:0%
candidates candidates are voters so he
 
00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:24.640 align:start position:0%
believes that um the intent um of using
 
00:30:26.669 --> 00:30:26.679 align:start position:0%
the information of the party affiliation
 
00:30:30.549 --> 00:30:30.559 align:start position:0%
of candidates um is is irrelevant there
 
00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:34.320 align:start position:0%
um Phil also uh asserts that Artic part
 
00:30:38.430 --> 00:30:38.440 align:start position:0%
part two article 11 um is one place but
 
00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:41.440 align:start position:0%
he also recommends that this be in also
 
00:30:45.950 --> 00:30:45.960 align:start position:0%
inserted into article 26 and article 65
 
00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
so that it's not just in the house Maps
 
00:30:49.149 --> 00:30:49.159 align:start position:0%
it's in the Senate maps and the
 
00:30:52.909 --> 00:30:52.919 align:start position:0%
executive Council Maps um so that it's
 
00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:54.720 align:start position:0%
um in multiple places in the New
 
00:30:57.310 --> 00:30:57.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution and he also says
 
00:30:59.269 --> 00:30:59.279 align:start position:0%
maybe we should use partisan Jerry
 
00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:01.360 align:start position:0%
Mander uh partisan data for
 
00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:04.240 align:start position:0%
Congressional Maps either um so he's
 
00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
sort of saying be inclusive of all the
 
00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
maps not just the house Maps um and then
 
00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
he also makes the point which I think
 
00:31:12.149 --> 00:31:12.159 align:start position:0%
you've heard today about the Dover case
 
00:31:15.070 --> 00:31:15.080 align:start position:0%
and keeping towns together um and so he
 
00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:19.480 align:start position:0%
has um some other language um in article
 
00:31:22.909 --> 00:31:22.919 align:start position:0%
11 um within reasonable deviation from
 
00:31:25.710 --> 00:31:25.720 align:start position:0%
the ideal population Phil Phil thinks
 
00:31:28.509 --> 00:31:28.519 align:start position:0%
that this could be better said if you
 
00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:31.760 align:start position:0%
insert language of each town or Ward
 
00:31:33.870 --> 00:31:33.880 align:start position:0%
having enough
 
00:31:36.149 --> 00:31:36.159 align:start position:0%
inhabitants um to The
 
00:31:38.549 --> 00:31:38.559 align:start position:0%
Entity or one or more representative
 
00:31:41.190 --> 00:31:41.200 align:start position:0%
seats so to to clarify what what the
 
00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:44.480 align:start position:0%
legislative intent on that article 11 um
 
00:31:48.190 --> 00:31:48.200 align:start position:0%
and then one more um minor issue that
 
00:31:51.070 --> 00:31:51.080 align:start position:0%
Phil has is also in the second sentence
 
00:31:54.350 --> 00:31:54.360 align:start position:0%
of article 11 requiring each town or W
 
00:31:58.789 --> 00:31:58.799 align:start position:0%
to be included in one in a non laral
 
00:32:02.909 --> 00:32:02.919 align:start position:0%
District um Phil thinks that he would
 
00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:05.360 align:start position:0%
recommend the second sentence saying the
 
00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:08.120 align:start position:0%
number of eligible Town WS should be
 
00:32:12.669 --> 00:32:12.679 align:start position:0%
denied on um should be uh minimized so
 
00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:14.320 align:start position:0%
he thinks you should use minim
 
00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:16.840 align:start position:0%
minimization instead of float Arial so
 
00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:18.320 align:start position:0%
those are Phil's ideas to strengthen
 
00:32:20.789 --> 00:32:20.799 align:start position:0%
this bill um but does support it as it
 
00:32:23.070 --> 00:32:23.080 align:start position:0%
is if if there is no Amendment and I
 
00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:25.120 align:start position:0%
have written testimony for both um and
 
00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:29.360 align:start position:0%
then I also just want to add quickly um
 
00:32:30.870 --> 00:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
uh in the question that representative
 
00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:34.440 align:start position:0%
Lang asked um deviation is different
 
00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
than effic efficiency Gap so deviation
 
00:32:39.870 --> 00:32:39.880 align:start position:0%
is how is the metric where we measure
 
00:32:42.389 --> 00:32:42.399 align:start position:0%
what the population increases efficiency
 
00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:44.320 align:start position:0%
Gap is just another tool to measure
 
00:32:46.950 --> 00:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
partisan data um but deviation is a
 
00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
slightly different um term of
 
00:32:52.909 --> 00:32:52.919 align:start position:0%
Art and I'm with that I'm happy to take
 
00:32:55.549 --> 00:32:55.559 align:start position:0%
questions are there questions um I so
 
00:32:56.789 --> 00:32:56.799 align:start position:0%
this would only apply to the state
 
00:32:58.549 --> 00:32:58.559 align:start position:0%
representative Maps
 
00:33:01.230 --> 00:33:01.240 align:start position:0%
um the way Phil reads this is it is only
 
00:33:04.830 --> 00:33:04.840 align:start position:0%
inter um it's only inserting this into
 
00:33:08.269 --> 00:33:08.279 align:start position:0%
article 11 and article 11 is the house
 
00:33:10.590 --> 00:33:10.600 align:start position:0%
Maps is the House of Representative Maps
 
00:33:12.549 --> 00:33:12.559 align:start position:0%
so that's why he's suggesting you also
 
00:33:15.070 --> 00:33:15.080 align:start position:0%
insert it into
 
00:33:19.029 --> 00:33:19.039 align:start position:0%
article uh now I'm look I think he said
 
00:33:22.590 --> 00:33:22.600 align:start position:0%
26 and and 65 which are the other maps
 
00:33:25.230 --> 00:33:25.240 align:start position:0%
in the state so um because the
 
00:33:26.830 --> 00:33:26.840 align:start position:0%
Constitution has different articles for
 
00:33:29.310 --> 00:33:29.320 align:start position:0%
each branch of government
 
00:33:31.590 --> 00:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
okay and any other questions so my
 
00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:32.760 align:start position:0%
follow would
 
00:33:35.950 --> 00:33:35.960 align:start position:0%
be uh what was the efficiency gap for
 
00:33:38.509 --> 00:33:38.519 align:start position:0%
the house map since this is what it's uh
 
00:33:38.519 --> 00:33:39.590 align:start position:0%
the house map since this is what it's uh
going

00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
going
 
00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
after um I I think it depends on each
 
00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
district some districts are upwards of
 
00:33:47.509 --> 00:33:47.519 align:start position:0%
50% and some have lower efficiency gaps
 
00:33:51.269 --> 00:33:51.279 align:start position:0%
so it depends on um I think there's what
 
00:33:51.279 --> 00:33:52.950 align:start position:0%
so it depends on um I think there's what
207

00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
207
 
00:33:55.350 --> 00:33:55.360 align:start position:0%
districts uh separate districts and so
 
00:33:58.350 --> 00:33:58.360 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's wildly dependent based on
 
00:34:00.549 --> 00:34:00.559 align:start position:0%
which district you're looking at got it
 
00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
but isn't it also true that the house
 
00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
map out of all the maps the State House
 
00:34:08.149 --> 00:34:08.159 align:start position:0%
map most closely reflected the Statewide
 
00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
popular vote correct okay guess which
 
00:34:12.589 --> 00:34:12.599 align:start position:0%
one I had the biggest hand in
 
00:34:15.270 --> 00:34:15.280 align:start position:0%
representative Lane it was that one it
 
00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
was that I thought I thought you drew
 
00:34:19.349 --> 00:34:19.359 align:start position:0%
the all the demonizing the map that I
 
00:34:20.990 --> 00:34:21.000 align:start position:0%
worked the most on was apparently the
 
00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
most Fair um but didn't you draw the
 
00:34:25.550 --> 00:34:25.560 align:start position:0%
Congressional map that got veto too uh
 
00:34:28.430 --> 00:34:28.440 align:start position:0%
no not not exclusively unfortunately
 
00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
I wish I had
 
00:34:34.430 --> 00:34:34.440 align:start position:0%
um the uh to be fair uh just you know my
 
00:34:35.869 --> 00:34:35.879 align:start position:0%
my map actually never made it to the
 
00:34:38.389 --> 00:34:38.399 align:start position:0%
governor's desk my my map got over ended
 
00:34:42.869 --> 00:34:42.879 align:start position:0%
in the Senate um next up last up is
 
00:34:55.109 --> 00:34:55.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:58.030 --> 00:34:58.040 align:start position:0%
stro thank you chairman Barry um this
 
00:34:59.829 --> 00:34:59.839 align:start position:0%
testimony is on behalf of Leonard
 
00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:02.640 align:start position:0%
Campbell of Meredith New Hampshire he
 
00:35:05.710 --> 00:35:05.720 align:start position:0%
also supports cacr to and he says
 
00:35:07.950 --> 00:35:07.960 align:start position:0%
honorable Representatives voting as the
 
00:35:10.589 --> 00:35:10.599 align:start position:0%
Lynch pin of any sound Society have a
 
00:35:12.990 --> 00:35:13.000 align:start position:0%
just and Equitable system having a just
 
00:35:14.790 --> 00:35:14.800 align:start position:0%
and Equitable system ensures that the
 
00:35:17.109 --> 00:35:17.119 align:start position:0%
voting reflects the will of the people
 
00:35:19.069 --> 00:35:19.079 align:start position:0%
at a time when divisiveness and Rancor
 
00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
make legislating more difficult cacr 2
 
00:35:23.589 --> 00:35:23.599 align:start position:0%
will aspire to A system that does
 
00:35:25.310 --> 00:35:25.320 align:start position:0%
reflect the will of the people as in
 
00:35:27.870 --> 00:35:27.880 align:start position:0%
effect it will remind us that stranded
 
00:35:29.910 --> 00:35:29.920 align:start position:0%
tiny pockets of Voters are not
 
00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
marginalized this is a common sense res
 
00:35:35.069 --> 00:35:35.079 align:start position:0%
resolution the only opposition will come
 
00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
from those who perceive a benefit for
 
00:35:38.910 --> 00:35:38.920 align:start position:0%
having lines drawn to support a
 
00:35:41.390 --> 00:35:41.400 align:start position:0%
particular political party please
 
00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
support this resolution for the respect
 
00:35:46.109 --> 00:35:46.119 align:start position:0%
for the New Hampshire Constitution and
 
00:35:47.950 --> 00:35:47.960 align:start position:0%
he inserted a quote it says all
 
00:35:49.870 --> 00:35:49.880 align:start position:0%
government of right originates from the
 
00:35:51.829 --> 00:35:51.839 align:start position:0%
people is founded in consent and
 
00:35:54.710 --> 00:35:54.720 align:start position:0%
instituted for the general good thank
 
00:35:56.750 --> 00:35:56.760 align:start position:0%

running I'll just read it R I respect it
 
00:36:02.470 --> 00:36:02.480 align:start position:0%
all right I don't have any more pink
 
00:36:05.470 --> 00:36:05.480 align:start position:0%
cards and my computer's freezing which I
 
00:36:08.190 --> 00:36:08.200 align:start position:0%
don't know why it's doing that um online
 
00:36:09.910 --> 00:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
it was very lopsided and I don't know I
 
00:36:11.390 --> 00:36:11.400 align:start position:0%
apologize for not having it up already I
 
00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
did already read it for myself but not
 
00:36:16.870 --> 00:36:16.880 align:start position:0%
for everybody else uh election
 
00:36:22.190 --> 00:36:22.200 align:start position:0%
law cacr 2 um online was 353 in support
 
00:36:24.430 --> 00:36:24.440 align:start position:0%
six oppos zero neutral and with that we
 
00:36:27.910 --> 00:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
will close the public hearing on cacr 2
 
00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:30.240 align:start position:0%
and we will open the public hearing on
 
00:36:33.309 --> 00:36:33.319 align:start position:0%
House Bill 363 establishing
 
00:36:35.950 --> 00:36:35.960 align:start position:0%
redistricting criteria and we will
 
00:36:39.190 --> 00:36:39.200 align:start position:0%
recognize our own representative Lane
 
00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:40.720 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of introduction who will
 
00:36:44.190 --> 00:36:44.200 align:start position:0%
very kindly get me a pink card uh oh has
 
00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:46.240 align:start position:0%
one already ready to go awesome I wasn't
 
00:36:48.670 --> 00:36:48.680 align:start position:0%
fast enough all right representative
 
00:36:51.349 --> 00:36:51.359 align:start position:0%
Lane uh thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:36:54.190 --> 00:36:54.200 align:start position:0%
committee um for the record I'm
 
00:36:56.510 --> 00:36:56.520 align:start position:0%
representative Connie Lane mayor M
 
00:37:00.109 --> 00:37:00.119 align:start position:0%
district 16 which is W two and conquered
 
00:37:04.670 --> 00:37:04.680 align:start position:0%
um I brought this bill because um as as
 
00:37:07.270 --> 00:37:07.280 align:start position:0%
many of you know I keep bringing uh
 
00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:09.240 align:start position:0%
independent redistricting bills and they
 
00:37:13.069 --> 00:37:13.079 align:start position:0%
keep uh failing so this is an attempt to
 
00:37:16.349 --> 00:37:16.359 align:start position:0%
try another way that might be a little
 
00:37:19.829 --> 00:37:19.839 align:start position:0%
easier uh than doing an amendment to uh
 
00:37:22.390 --> 00:37:22.400 align:start position:0%
or a statute to set up an independent
 
00:37:24.470 --> 00:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
redistricting committee not that I'm
 
00:37:27.910 --> 00:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
giving up on that idea but um this Bill
 
00:37:30.109 --> 00:37:30.119 align:start position:0%
implements criteria that need to be
 
00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:33.160 align:start position:0%
followed when redistricting occurs and
 
00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
it will make redistricting districts the
 
00:37:38.470 --> 00:37:38.480 align:start position:0%
process more fair and more transparent
 
00:37:40.510 --> 00:37:40.520 align:start position:0%
uh right now our legislature has almost
 
00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
no criteria that it needs to follow when
 
00:37:45.309 --> 00:37:45.319 align:start position:0%
redistricting which is why we've ended
 
00:37:48.390 --> 00:37:48.400 align:start position:0%
up with the districts that uh we have uh
 
00:37:50.950 --> 00:37:50.960 align:start position:0%
that have been referenced in the
 
00:37:56.390 --> 00:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
testimony for cacr 2 it uh redistricting
 
00:37:58.510 --> 00:37:58.520 align:start position:0%
must follow the US Constitution the New
 
00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution federal laws and
 
00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:04.240 align:start position:0%
state laws and this bill adds additional
 
00:38:06.870 --> 00:38:06.880 align:start position:0%
criteria that have become considered
 
00:38:09.829 --> 00:38:09.839 align:start position:0%
traditional districting principles and
 
00:38:11.829 --> 00:38:11.839 align:start position:0%
some emerging criteria that have been
 
00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:13.560 align:start position:0%
used by other states
 
00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:16.720 align:start position:0%
increasingly so what is required now
 
00:38:18.790 --> 00:38:18.800 align:start position:0%
constitutional districts must be as
 
00:38:21.870 --> 00:38:21.880 align:start position:0%
equal in population as possible with a
 
00:38:25.309 --> 00:38:25.319 align:start position:0%
deviation of less than 1% and I think M
 
00:38:26.750 --> 00:38:26.760 align:start position:0%
zinc may want to correct me when she
 
00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:28.680 align:start position:0%
comes up whether I got deviation in
 
00:38:31.109 --> 00:38:31.119 align:start position:0%
efficiency right but State districts
 
00:38:33.870 --> 00:38:33.880 align:start position:0%
must be as equal as possible but are
 
00:38:36.109 --> 00:38:36.119 align:start position:0%
allowed a deviation of less than 10%
 
00:38:39.470 --> 00:38:39.480 align:start position:0%
through custom and case law Federal Law
 
00:38:41.470 --> 00:38:41.480 align:start position:0%
requires that you follow the 14th and
 
00:38:44.109 --> 00:38:44.119 align:start position:0%
15th amendments which prohibit racial
 
00:38:46.270 --> 00:38:46.280 align:start position:0%
discrimination and they require the that
 
00:38:48.630 --> 00:38:48.640 align:start position:0%
you comply with the Voting Rights Act
 
00:38:50.950 --> 00:38:50.960 align:start position:0%
state law requires that the districts be
 
00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
continuous and if a town or district has
 
00:38:55.069 --> 00:38:55.079 align:start position:0%
enough people to meet the standard
 
00:38:58.589 --> 00:38:58.599 align:start position:0%
deviation it is to form its own District
 
00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:00.640 align:start position:0%
these criteria are some of the
 
00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:02.720 align:start position:0%
traditional district and as we just
 
00:39:07.550 --> 00:39:07.560 align:start position:0%
heard there are 62 um uh communities
 
00:39:10.109 --> 00:39:10.119 align:start position:0%
that would have 62
 
00:39:14.270 --> 00:39:14.280 align:start position:0%
errors under state law we've created 62
 
00:39:18.349 --> 00:39:18.359 align:start position:0%
districts that violate the few criteria
 
00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:21.040 align:start position:0%
that we do have other traditional
 
00:39:22.910 --> 00:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
criteria that New Hampshire does not
 
00:39:25.670 --> 00:39:25.680 align:start position:0%
have um that are included in this bill
 
00:39:28.470 --> 00:39:28.480 align:start position:0%
are compactness and preservation of
 
00:39:32.670 --> 00:39:32.680 align:start position:0%
communities of Interest HB 363 also
 
00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
includes the emerging criteria that the
 
00:39:38.069 --> 00:39:38.079 align:start position:0%
result shall not have the intent or
 
00:39:41.550 --> 00:39:41.560 align:start position:0%
effect of favoring or disfavoring any
 
00:39:44.550 --> 00:39:44.560 align:start position:0%
political party incumbent or candidate
 
00:39:47.630 --> 00:39:47.640 align:start position:0%
for office I've included an article from
 
00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
the National Conference of state
 
00:39:52.670 --> 00:39:52.680 align:start position:0%
legislatures that was updated and 2021
 
00:39:55.309 --> 00:39:55.319 align:start position:0%
in my submission to the committee um
 
00:39:56.910 --> 00:39:56.920 align:start position:0%
that shows what other states have
 
00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:00.640 align:start position:0%
adopted as criteria there's about 12
 
00:40:02.589 --> 00:40:02.599 align:start position:0%
that are like New Hampshire and the rest
 
00:40:05.710 --> 00:40:05.720 align:start position:0%
have more stringent Criterion about 23
 
00:40:07.870 --> 00:40:07.880 align:start position:0%
states have adopted the criteria that
 
00:40:11.829 --> 00:40:11.839 align:start position:0%
are proposed in HB 363
 
00:40:16.309 --> 00:40:16.319 align:start position:0%
including um Alabama Alaska Arizona
 
00:40:20.230 --> 00:40:20.240 align:start position:0%
Arkansas Georgia Idaho Missouri Nebraska
 
00:40:23.069 --> 00:40:23.079 align:start position:0%
Nevada Oklahoma and South
 
00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
Dakota um I would like to reference and
 
00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:28.240 align:start position:0%
incorporate the comments of Mr Parry in
 
00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
my comments uh so that I don't go on and
 
00:40:35.390 --> 00:40:35.400 align:start position:0%
on and repeat everything that he said um
 
00:40:37.829 --> 00:40:37.839 align:start position:0%
our existing system of redistricting
 
00:40:40.349 --> 00:40:40.359 align:start position:0%
does not result in districts that fairly
 
00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
represent the voters both parties draw
 
00:40:46.230 --> 00:40:46.240 align:start position:0%
lines to favor their party and have done
 
00:40:49.630 --> 00:40:49.640 align:start position:0%
so for decades both parties are guilty
 
00:40:51.950 --> 00:40:51.960 align:start position:0%
of protecting and expanding their power
 
00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:52.829 align:start position:0%
of protecting and expanding their power
through

00:40:52.829 --> 00:40:52.839 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:40:55.589 --> 00:40:55.599 align:start position:0%
redistricting and our constituents know
 
00:40:58.589 --> 00:40:58.599 align:start position:0%
it and are not in favor of our past
 
00:41:01.829 --> 00:41:01.839 align:start position:0%
practices 74 towns in New Hampshire
 
00:41:05.270 --> 00:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
passed resolutions asking for fair maps
 
00:41:07.990 --> 00:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
in 2021 but they were
 
00:41:10.750 --> 00:41:10.760 align:start position:0%
ignored all the people who came to
 
00:41:13.309 --> 00:41:13.319 align:start position:0%
testify at the 10 hearings that we had
 
00:41:15.230 --> 00:41:15.240 align:start position:0%
for the redistricting committee were
 
00:41:19.390 --> 00:41:19.400 align:start position:0%
also ignored the process in 2021 was not
 
00:41:21.589 --> 00:41:21.599 align:start position:0%
transparent and the majority of the
 
00:41:24.069 --> 00:41:24.079 align:start position:0%
redistricting committee did not address
 
00:41:27.390 --> 00:41:27.400 align:start position:0%
the many pleas that we heard in those 10
 
00:41:30.349 --> 00:41:30.359 align:start position:0%
public hearings for fair and transparent
 
00:41:33.630 --> 00:41:33.640 align:start position:0%
Maps the Criterion in this bill are a
 
00:41:36.829 --> 00:41:36.839 align:start position:0%
starting point for transparency it will
 
00:41:39.069 --> 00:41:39.079 align:start position:0%
require that these factors be considered
 
00:41:42.589 --> 00:41:42.599 align:start position:0%
when drawing the new maps in
 
00:41:45.630 --> 00:41:45.640 align:start position:0%
2031 jeram Mandarin discourages
 
00:41:47.710 --> 00:41:47.720 align:start position:0%
participation in our constitutional
 
00:41:50.670 --> 00:41:50.680 align:start position:0%
democracy and makes our constitution our
 
00:41:54.510 --> 00:41:54.520 align:start position:0%
makes our constituents jaded and cynical
 
00:41:56.990 --> 00:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
and worse they do not trust us and they
 
00:41:58.950 --> 00:41:58.960 align:start position:0%
think think we're all self-serving and
 
00:42:01.390 --> 00:42:01.400 align:start position:0%
corrupt for these reasons it is
 
00:42:04.589 --> 00:42:04.599 align:start position:0%
imperative that we change our system to
 
00:42:07.550 --> 00:42:07.560 align:start position:0%
make it more transparent and less
 
00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
political we each represent constituents
 
00:42:13.829 --> 00:42:13.839 align:start position:0%
of both parties and have taken an oath
 
00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
to represent all of them to the best of
 
00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
our ability not just those of our party
 
00:42:23.109 --> 00:42:23.119 align:start position:0%
we must put our constituents above our
 
00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:26.640 align:start position:0%
party we may never be able to remove
 
00:42:29.670 --> 00:42:29.680 align:start position:0%
politics totally from redistricting but
 
00:42:32.190 --> 00:42:32.200 align:start position:0%
we certainly owe it to our constituents
 
00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
and our constitutional democracy to try
 
00:42:37.950 --> 00:42:37.960 align:start position:0%
for these reasons I ask that you vote
 
00:42:42.030 --> 00:42:42.040 align:start position:0%
OTP on this Bill thank you and yes I
 
00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
will take questions perfect question got
 
00:42:46.069 --> 00:42:46.079 align:start position:0%
my Flack jacket
 
00:42:48.670 --> 00:42:48.680 align:start position:0%
on I don't know I feel like I got my I
 
00:42:51.069 --> 00:42:51.079 align:start position:0%
feel I got my points out on the last one
 
00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:53.200 align:start position:0%
um questions from the
 
00:42:55.190 --> 00:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
00:42:57.390 --> 00:42:57.400 align:start position:0%
C thank you Mr chairman thank thank you
 
00:43:01.390 --> 00:43:01.400 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um how do you
 
00:43:04.390 --> 00:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
reconcile the fact that uh for house
 
00:43:07.549 --> 00:43:07.559 align:start position:0%
districts we have to stay within county
 
00:43:10.790 --> 00:43:10.800 align:start position:0%
lines and there are at least a couple
 
00:43:13.790 --> 00:43:13.800 align:start position:0%
instances in the state where a
 
00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:14.990 align:start position:0%
instances in the state where a
particular

00:43:14.990 --> 00:43:15.000 align:start position:0%
particular
 
00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:18.720 align:start position:0%
town can does not have enough for one
 
00:43:21.630 --> 00:43:21.640 align:start position:0%
representative but can only be in with a
 
00:43:23.630 --> 00:43:23.640 align:start position:0%
large another larger town and one
 
00:43:25.230 --> 00:43:25.240 align:start position:0%
specific Town it can't be changed
 
00:43:29.670 --> 00:43:29.680 align:start position:0%
because of the County Line well actually
 
00:43:32.430 --> 00:43:32.440 align:start position:0%
for house districts it is not required
 
00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
to keep them within county lines it is a
 
00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:38.960 align:start position:0%
practice a it is a custom but it is not
 
00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:42.400 align:start position:0%
required in the statutes or the
 
00:43:46.030 --> 00:43:46.040 align:start position:0%
Constitutional um but there is a way I'm
 
00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:51.200 align:start position:0%
not the uh Jam manderin nerd that uh Mr
 
00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
Peters is and I'm sure he can answer
 
00:43:55.309 --> 00:43:55.319 align:start position:0%
that question better than I can but I I
 
00:43:56.750 --> 00:43:56.760 align:start position:0%
suspect that there's a way to do it
 
00:43:58.990 --> 00:43:59.000 align:start position:0%
better than what we have now and when
 
00:44:01.270 --> 00:44:01.280 align:start position:0%
you follow these criteria there's
 
00:44:03.829 --> 00:44:03.839 align:start position:0%
Criterion there's a better way to do it
 
00:44:05.910 --> 00:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
you are always going to have ferals
 
00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
unless we reduce the number of
 
00:44:11.430 --> 00:44:11.440 align:start position:0%
representatives in the
 
00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:13.990 align:start position:0%
representatives in the
state

00:44:13.990 --> 00:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:44:16.309 --> 00:44:16.319 align:start position:0%
house if only someone had a proposed
 
00:44:18.829 --> 00:44:18.839 align:start position:0%
going to 391 last
 
00:44:21.309 --> 00:44:21.319 align:start position:0%
time a move that a move that Mr Andrew
 
00:44:23.390 --> 00:44:23.400 align:start position:0%
and I in in a weird politics making
 
00:44:26.309 --> 00:44:26.319 align:start position:0%
weird bical both support it I guess um
 
00:44:27.549 --> 00:44:27.559 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
00:44:29.829 --> 00:44:29.839 align:start position:0%
for representative Lane seeing none next
 
00:44:31.750 --> 00:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
up is Mr Andrews who maybe we can talk
 
00:44:34.670 --> 00:44:34.680 align:start position:0%
about spoke it is Mr Andrews so thank
 
00:44:37.309 --> 00:44:37.319 align:start position:0%
you maybe Mr Andrew can explain why 391
 
00:44:40.950 --> 00:44:40.960 align:start position:0%
was in fact the optimal number um for
 
00:44:43.390 --> 00:44:43.400 align:start position:0%
for better drawings well we could go the
 
00:44:45.109 --> 00:44:45.119 align:start position:0%
way I think it's either South Dakota or
 
00:44:48.750 --> 00:44:48.760 align:start position:0%
North Dakota that has um just one
 
00:44:52.829 --> 00:44:52.839 align:start position:0%
representative per District so that's
 
00:44:54.829 --> 00:44:54.839 align:start position:0%
how they determine the number of people
 
00:44:57.510 --> 00:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
in their legislature I thought it was
 
00:44:59.230 --> 00:44:59.240 align:start position:0%
kind of an interesting approach I think
 
00:45:00.549 --> 00:45:00.559 align:start position:0%
that's how we ended up with 400 though
 
00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
is because we kept doing that and then
 
00:45:03.910 --> 00:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
somebody finally went
 
00:45:06.309 --> 00:45:06.319 align:start position:0%
hey okay thank
 
00:45:09.230 --> 00:45:09.240 align:start position:0%
you and then on Deck will be Olivia
 
00:45:12.309 --> 00:45:12.319 align:start position:0%
zinc Mr rers I I want to hear about 391
 
00:45:20.670 --> 00:45:20.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:23.750 --> 00:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
was there we go yeah 391 was a very
 
00:45:25.150 --> 00:45:25.160 align:start position:0%
interesting concept I don't think I can
 
00:45:27.670 --> 00:45:27.680 align:start position:0%
get into all the math in this or
 
00:45:33.270 --> 00:45:33.280 align:start position:0%
but um uh I'm here to uh testify in
 
00:45:34.670 --> 00:45:34.680 align:start position:0%
support of HB
 
00:45:37.750 --> 00:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
363 um I think that it is a good
 
00:45:46.349 --> 00:45:46.359 align:start position:0%
addition to uh CRC CRC c cacr 2 um uh
 
00:45:48.790 --> 00:45:48.800 align:start position:0%
and uh it helps clarify some of the
 
00:45:53.150 --> 00:45:53.160 align:start position:0%
things uh I like um the representative's
 
00:45:54.829 --> 00:45:54.839 align:start position:0%
question about our communities of
 
00:45:57.829 --> 00:45:57.839 align:start position:0%
Interest political parties um it says
 
00:45:59.870 --> 00:45:59.880 align:start position:0%
here communities of Interest shall not
 
00:46:01.589 --> 00:46:01.599 align:start position:0%
include common relationships with
 
00:46:02.990 --> 00:46:03.000 align:start position:0%
political parties or political
 
00:46:06.190 --> 00:46:06.200 align:start position:0%
candidates so if we uh pass both of
 
00:46:08.270 --> 00:46:08.280 align:start position:0%
these then it would you know help
 
00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
strengthen the uh c cacr 2
 
00:46:16.870 --> 00:46:16.880 align:start position:0%
um one thing I do kind of have a an
 
00:46:19.230 --> 00:46:19.240 align:start position:0%
issue with is uh section four which says
 
00:46:20.990 --> 00:46:21.000 align:start position:0%
districts shall be drawn in compact
 
00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:24.160 align:start position:0%
shapes and shall avoid Jagged edges and
 
00:46:28.470 --> 00:46:28.480 align:start position:0%
extensions um the
 
00:46:31.870 --> 00:46:31.880 align:start position:0%
compactness in terms of redistricting is
 
00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
used mostly as a simplistic way to kind
 
00:46:38.670 --> 00:46:38.680 align:start position:0%
of show uh Jerry mandering in that it's
 
00:46:40.910 --> 00:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
very easy for me to go to someone and
 
00:46:43.309 --> 00:46:43.319 align:start position:0%
show say Senate District 9 which goes
 
00:46:45.990 --> 00:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
from Hinsdale to Bedford and be like
 
00:46:47.950 --> 00:46:47.960 align:start position:0%
this is this is a little weird isn't it
 
00:46:49.790 --> 00:46:49.800 align:start position:0%
that it's just a straight line what does
 
00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
Hinsdale have to do with Bedford um but
 
00:46:55.270 --> 00:46:55.280 align:start position:0%
if you take into account you know
 
00:46:58.069 --> 00:46:58.079 align:start position:0%
communities of interest you can
 
00:47:01.270 --> 00:47:01.280 align:start position:0%
get some districts that are not you know
 
00:47:03.870 --> 00:47:03.880 align:start position:0%
kind of very compact in shapes for
 
00:47:07.150 --> 00:47:07.160 align:start position:0%
instance um you know I said before we
 
00:47:10.109 --> 00:47:10.119 align:start position:0%
were using uh saus as a community of
 
00:47:14.309 --> 00:47:14.319 align:start position:0%
interest um sau1 is kind of very Compact
 
00:47:16.030 --> 00:47:16.040 align:start position:0%
and then you have Dublin that kind of
 
00:47:21.190 --> 00:47:21.200 align:start position:0%
shoots off into in it's um so like you
 
00:47:25.190 --> 00:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
can't use compactness as a kind of
 
00:47:27.950 --> 00:47:27.960 align:start position:0%
standard um there's a better ways to
 
00:47:30.750 --> 00:47:30.760 align:start position:0%
kind of Judge whether a map is kind of
 
00:47:34.910 --> 00:47:34.920 align:start position:0%
gerrymandered rather than um using uh
 
00:47:39.150 --> 00:47:39.160 align:start position:0%
compact shapes and uh compactness as a
 
00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:40.710 align:start position:0%
compact shapes and uh compactness as a
metric

00:47:40.710 --> 00:47:40.720 align:start position:0%
metric
 
00:47:45.109 --> 00:47:45.119 align:start position:0%
um the I think I think that's I all I
 
00:47:47.710 --> 00:47:47.720 align:start position:0%
had on this
 
00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
um but the main the main points are you
 
00:47:55.150 --> 00:47:55.160 align:start position:0%
know the section six and seven where uh
 
00:47:55.160 --> 00:47:57.829 align:start position:0%
know the section six and seven where uh
the

00:47:57.829 --> 00:47:57.839 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
plans shall not have the intent or
 
00:48:02.349 --> 00:48:02.359 align:start position:0%
effect of favoring or disfavoring a
 
00:48:04.270 --> 00:48:04.280 align:start position:0%
political party incumbent or candidate
 
00:48:06.109 --> 00:48:06.119 align:start position:0%
for office which kind of is the same
 
00:48:08.670 --> 00:48:08.680 align:start position:0%
thing as cacr too but helps clarify that
 
00:48:10.030 --> 00:48:10.040 align:start position:0%
language a little bit
 
00:48:12.510 --> 00:48:12.520 align:start position:0%
more okay further questions from the
 
00:48:13.309 --> 00:48:13.319 align:start position:0%
committee I assume you're taking
 
00:48:16.030 --> 00:48:16.040 align:start position:0%
questions you were so kind last time all
 
00:48:18.510 --> 00:48:18.520 align:start position:0%
right no 291 reference it's all right
 
00:48:20.790 --> 00:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
all right next up is Olivia zinc and on
 
00:48:25.030 --> 00:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
Deck is uh Kaye estadio for one and two
 
00:48:27.069 --> 00:48:27.079 align:start position:0%
um and then after that we'll be the last
 
00:48:29.430 --> 00:48:29.440 align:start position:0%
card of margerie Porter honorable marger
 
00:48:31.470 --> 00:48:31.480 align:start position:0%

00:48:33.829 --> 00:48:33.839 align:start position:0%
keep good morning for the record Olivia
 
00:48:35.549 --> 00:48:35.559 align:start position:0%
zinc a voter in Franklin executive
 
00:48:37.790 --> 00:48:37.800 align:start position:0%
director of open democracy um and open
 
00:48:41.549 --> 00:48:41.559 align:start position:0%
democracy supports this bill um there
 
00:48:43.190 --> 00:48:43.200 align:start position:0%
there are ways that we can improve the
 
00:48:45.109 --> 00:48:45.119 align:start position:0%
redistricting cycle that happens every
 
00:48:48.230 --> 00:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
decade um it is important um this is an
 
00:48:50.030 --> 00:48:50.040 align:start position:0%
important opportunity that we greatly
 
00:48:53.789 --> 00:48:53.799 align:start position:0%
appreciate and the spe um and really
 
00:48:55.950 --> 00:48:55.960 align:start position:0%
appreciate that there was documents on
 
00:48:57.789 --> 00:48:57.799 align:start position:0%
the special committee for redistricting
 
00:48:59.870 --> 00:48:59.880 align:start position:0%
website and the you know allowing people
 
00:49:03.430 --> 00:49:03.440 align:start position:0%
to upload testimony way improved the
 
00:49:05.309 --> 00:49:05.319 align:start position:0%
transparency from this decade for the
 
00:49:07.510 --> 00:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
last decade um but one thing that there
 
00:49:11.750 --> 00:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
was not um any kind of transparency on
 
00:49:15.470 --> 00:49:15.480 align:start position:0%
was the criteria of how the maps are
 
00:49:18.710 --> 00:49:18.720 align:start position:0%
drawn um to establish criteria in
 
00:49:21.589 --> 00:49:21.599 align:start position:0%
drawing Maps um you would one consult
 
00:49:23.750 --> 00:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Constitution and the
 
00:49:25.910 --> 00:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
US Constitution on what's required
 
00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:27.349 align:start position:0%
US Constitution on what's required
constitutionally

00:49:27.349 --> 00:49:27.359 align:start position:0%
constitutionally
 
00:49:29.470 --> 00:49:29.480 align:start position:0%
um but there are some great resources
 
00:49:31.589 --> 00:49:31.599 align:start position:0%
from the National Conference on state
 
00:49:33.789 --> 00:49:33.799 align:start position:0%
legislatures um and the Brennan Center
 
00:49:35.470 --> 00:49:35.480 align:start position:0%
but there were also some resources from
 
00:49:37.109 --> 00:49:37.119 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Supreme Court and the
 
00:49:40.390 --> 00:49:40.400 align:start position:0%
US Supreme Court that were can put up as
 
00:49:44.710 --> 00:49:44.720 align:start position:0%
uh guide guide posts this year um but we
 
00:49:47.470 --> 00:49:47.480 align:start position:0%
were kind of astonished that New
 
00:49:49.270 --> 00:49:49.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire kind of uses this halfhazard
 
00:49:52.829 --> 00:49:52.839 align:start position:0%
approach to redistricting um without
 
00:49:55.750 --> 00:49:55.760 align:start position:0%
publishing the criteria that is used to
 
00:49:57.510 --> 00:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
draw the maps
 
00:50:00.750 --> 00:50:00.760 align:start position:0%
um regarding communities of Interest one
 
00:50:03.150 --> 00:50:03.160 align:start position:0%
small thing that we would recommend is
 
00:50:07.190 --> 00:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
on line 16 of this bill adding education
 
00:50:11.430 --> 00:50:11.440 align:start position:0%
so racial ethnic um economic but
 
00:50:13.390 --> 00:50:13.400 align:start position:0%
educational districts I think that there
 
00:50:16.230 --> 00:50:16.240 align:start position:0%
are many school districts I'll just take
 
00:50:18.470 --> 00:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
um with the winnisquam school district
 
00:50:20.390 --> 00:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
um Tilton and Northfield Sheriff fire
 
00:50:22.549 --> 00:50:22.559 align:start position:0%
district CH Tilton and Northfield share
 
00:50:26.789 --> 00:50:26.799 align:start position:0%
a uh um School District but Tilton
 
00:50:28.670 --> 00:50:28.680 align:start position:0%
Northfield do not share a state repb
 
00:50:30.349 --> 00:50:30.359 align:start position:0%
district actually Northfield is with
 
00:50:34.549 --> 00:50:34.559 align:start position:0%
Franklin and uh Tilton is with I think
 
00:50:36.789 --> 00:50:36.799 align:start position:0%
was with samton but I think it got M
 
00:50:39.789 --> 00:50:39.799 align:start position:0%
moved this last time so I think um
 
00:50:42.309 --> 00:50:42.319 align:start position:0%
representative Harvey uh Bola would know
 
00:50:43.510 --> 00:50:43.520 align:start position:0%
because that's her
 
00:50:46.549 --> 00:50:46.559 align:start position:0%
District um of how those districts
 
00:50:48.910 --> 00:50:48.920 align:start position:0%
change but that those communities have a
 
00:50:51.390 --> 00:50:51.400 align:start position:0%
lot of shared shared water system shared
 
00:50:54.710 --> 00:50:54.720 align:start position:0%
Fire Systems shared um school districts
 
00:50:57.510 --> 00:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
and and that they have lots in and
 
00:50:57.520 --> 00:50:59.950 align:start position:0%
and and that they have lots in and
representation

00:50:59.950 --> 00:50:59.960 align:start position:0%
representation
 
00:51:02.589 --> 00:51:02.599 align:start position:0%
um you know so I think that that we
 
00:51:04.630 --> 00:51:04.640 align:start position:0%
should think about putting the word
 
00:51:09.270 --> 00:51:09.280 align:start position:0%
educational opportunities into that um
 
00:51:10.630 --> 00:51:10.640 align:start position:0%
and with that I'll I'll close my
 
00:51:12.349 --> 00:51:12.359 align:start position:0%
testimony and I have one small statement
 
00:51:15.549 --> 00:51:15.559 align:start position:0%
from Jeff Smith um from eping um who
 
00:51:18.390 --> 00:51:18.400 align:start position:0%
supports this and um basically says
 
00:51:20.430 --> 00:51:20.440 align:start position:0%
urges the committee to support this for
 
00:51:25.390 --> 00:51:25.400 align:start position:0%
the reason um that the December 2022 spe
 
00:51:27.190 --> 00:51:27.200 align:start position:0%
report on the special committee on voter
 
00:51:29.309 --> 00:51:29.319 align:start position:0%
confidence says partisan process in
 
00:51:32.230 --> 00:51:32.240 align:start position:0%
drying electric districts has determined
 
00:51:35.030 --> 00:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
undermined confidence and so he cites
 
00:51:36.789 --> 00:51:36.799 align:start position:0%
that as one reason to support this and
 
00:51:39.710 --> 00:51:39.720 align:start position:0%
the second reason um is the principle of
 
00:51:42.950 --> 00:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
equality under law that means that every
 
00:51:44.950 --> 00:51:44.960 align:start position:0%
voter eligible voter should count
 
00:51:46.990 --> 00:51:47.000 align:start position:0%
equally so those are the two reasons
 
00:51:49.390 --> 00:51:49.400 align:start position:0%
that Jeff Smith of eping supports that
 
00:51:51.349 --> 00:51:51.359 align:start position:0%
have I take any questions okay other
 
00:51:53.789 --> 00:51:53.799 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee seeing none
 
00:51:57.789 --> 00:51:57.799 align:start position:0%
thank you um next up is Kaye estadio for
 
00:51:57.799 --> 00:51:59.510 align:start position:0%
thank you um next up is Kaye estadio for
the

00:51:59.510 --> 00:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:52:01.910 --> 00:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
two before I confus myself again and
 
00:52:05.069 --> 00:52:05.079 align:start position:0%
then we did have a late entry from um Mr
 
00:52:08.030 --> 00:52:08.040 align:start position:0%
Perry thank you chairman Barry um for
 
00:52:10.270 --> 00:52:10.280 align:start position:0%
the record my name is Kaye of stadio I'm
 
00:52:11.990 --> 00:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
a public policy fellow with open
 
00:52:15.069 --> 00:52:15.079 align:start position:0%
democracy and a Durham voter first I
 
00:52:17.430 --> 00:52:17.440 align:start position:0%
have testimony on behalf of Linda Bundy
 
00:52:20.870 --> 00:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
of antrum she is in support of HB
 
00:52:23.470 --> 00:52:23.480 align:start position:0%
363 she says at Town meetings during
 
00:52:26.789 --> 00:52:26.799 align:start position:0%
2021 voters in 74 New Hampshire town
 
00:52:28.589 --> 00:52:28.599 align:start position:0%
approved and petitioned warrant articles
 
00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:30.240 align:start position:0%
calling for fair transparent and
 
00:52:33.190 --> 00:52:33.200 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan redistricting processes in
 
00:52:35.910 --> 00:52:35.920 align:start position:0%
December 2022 one of the findings of the
 
00:52:37.390 --> 00:52:37.400 align:start position:0%
report of the Secretary of State's
 
00:52:39.069 --> 00:52:39.079 align:start position:0%
special committee on voter confidence
 
00:52:41.069 --> 00:52:41.079 align:start position:0%
was that quote the present partisan
 
00:52:42.789 --> 00:52:42.799 align:start position:0%
process for the legislature to draw
 
00:52:44.630 --> 00:52:44.640 align:start position:0%
election districts every 10 years has
 
00:52:47.349 --> 00:52:47.359 align:start position:0%
undermined voter confidence end quote
 
00:52:49.030 --> 00:52:49.040 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire executive Council and
 
00:52:50.910 --> 00:52:50.920 align:start position:0%
state senate districts are examples of
 
00:52:53.430 --> 00:52:53.440 align:start position:0%
Jerry Mander districts this bill is one
 
00:52:55.390 --> 00:52:55.400 align:start position:0%
step towards establishing a process to
 
00:52:56.870 --> 00:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
create Fair districts that more
 
00:52:58.710 --> 00:52:58.720 align:start position:0%
accurately and more fairly represent the
 
00:53:01.309 --> 00:53:01.319 align:start position:0%
voters compact districts that take into
 
00:53:02.750 --> 00:53:02.760 align:start position:0%
account the communities of Interest
 
00:53:05.549 --> 00:53:05.559 align:start position:0%
shared by towns maintain local ties
 
00:53:07.150 --> 00:53:07.160 align:start position:0%
specifically stating that there shall be
 
00:53:08.990 --> 00:53:09.000 align:start position:0%
no intent or effect of favoring or
 
00:53:10.910 --> 00:53:10.920 align:start position:0%
disfavoring any political party
 
00:53:13.109 --> 00:53:13.119 align:start position:0%
candidate or incumbent will prevent
 
00:53:16.349 --> 00:53:16.359 align:start position:0%
Jerry mandering HB 363 establishes
 
00:53:18.750 --> 00:53:18.760 align:start position:0%
standards for redistrict redistricting
 
00:53:20.230 --> 00:53:20.240 align:start position:0%
that are transparent and reflect the
 
00:53:22.430 --> 00:53:22.440 align:start position:0%
will of the voters I ask that you vote a
 
00:53:24.390 --> 00:53:24.400 align:start position:0%
to pass on HB
 
00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:27.280 align:start position:0%
363 and then next I have testimony on
 
00:53:29.470 --> 00:53:29.480 align:start position:0%
behalf of Phil Hatcher of Dober New
 
00:53:32.470 --> 00:53:32.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire he says and you will see this
 
00:53:34.030 --> 00:53:34.040 align:start position:0%
soon I have the receipt of my
 
00:53:36.990 --> 00:53:37.000 align:start position:0%
grandfather John J Sansum which was
 
00:53:39.710 --> 00:53:39.720 align:start position:0%
given in 1908 when he paid his pole tax
 
00:53:42.670 --> 00:53:42.680 align:start position:0%
in mclenon County Texas today all
 
00:53:44.549 --> 00:53:44.559 align:start position:0%
Americans are ashamed that the P tax was
 
00:53:46.430 --> 00:53:46.440 align:start position:0%
employed to disenfranchise citizens of
 
00:53:49.470 --> 00:53:49.480 align:start position:0%
our country 100 years from now what will
 
00:53:51.950 --> 00:53:51.960 align:start position:0%
future citizens think of Jerry mandering
 
00:53:53.549 --> 00:53:53.559 align:start position:0%
will they be a shame that it took us so
 
00:53:55.510 --> 00:53:55.520 align:start position:0%
many years to eliminate the ability of
 
00:53:57.750 --> 00:53:57.760 align:start position:0%
legislature legislators to choose their
 
00:54:00.950 --> 00:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
voters I think so we all know that jurry
 
00:54:02.710 --> 00:54:02.720 align:start position:0%
mandering which is performed by both
 
00:54:05.109 --> 00:54:05.119 align:start position:0%
parties is weakening our democracy by
 
00:54:07.349 --> 00:54:07.359 align:start position:0%
contributing to the extreme polarization
 
00:54:09.870 --> 00:54:09.880 align:start position:0%
that has gripped our nation indeed Chief
 
00:54:11.870 --> 00:54:11.880 align:start position:0%
Justice John Roberts of the US Supreme
 
00:54:13.750 --> 00:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
Court writing for the majority in the
 
00:54:16.589 --> 00:54:16.599 align:start position:0%
landmark case of rucho V common cause
 
00:54:19.430 --> 00:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
from 2019 states that Jerry mandering is
 
00:54:22.270 --> 00:54:22.280 align:start position:0%
quote incompatible with Democratic
 
00:54:24.390 --> 00:54:24.400 align:start position:0%
principles but in New Hampshire we have
 
00:54:25.990 --> 00:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
been unable to find a solution for
 
00:54:28.789 --> 00:54:28.799 align:start position:0%
eliminating or diminishing jar mandering
 
00:54:32.510 --> 00:54:32.520 align:start position:0%
in 2019 and 2020 Governor sonunu vet
 
00:54:34.510 --> 00:54:34.520 align:start position:0%
vetoed bipartisan bills that would have
 
00:54:37.349 --> 00:54:37.359 align:start position:0%
created a redistricting Commission in
 
00:54:39.630 --> 00:54:39.640 align:start position:0%
2023 the New Hampshire Supreme Court in
 
00:54:42.109 --> 00:54:42.119 align:start position:0%
a 3 to2 Split Decision found that Jerry
 
00:54:44.710 --> 00:54:44.720 align:start position:0%
mandering is a non-justiciable under the
 
00:54:46.069 --> 00:54:46.079 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:54:49.710 --> 00:54:49.720 align:start position:0%
Constitution HP 363 by defining specific
 
00:54:52.109 --> 00:54:52.119 align:start position:0%
redistricting criteria offers a new
 
00:54:53.589 --> 00:54:53.599 align:start position:0%
approach that I support because it
 
00:54:55.789 --> 00:54:55.799 align:start position:0%
resonates with my experience as part of
 
00:54:57.829 --> 00:54:57.839 align:start position:0%
the map non citizen redistricting
 
00:54:58.990 --> 00:54:59.000 align:start position:0%
project in
 
00:55:02.069 --> 00:55:02.079 align:start position:0%
2021 in that nonpartisan project we work
 
00:55:04.589 --> 00:55:04.599 align:start position:0%
to define the criteria for our maps and
 
00:55:06.349 --> 00:55:06.359 align:start position:0%
then we assiduously stuck to those
 
00:55:09.069 --> 00:55:09.079 align:start position:0%
criteria as we develop the district Maps
 
00:55:10.910 --> 00:55:10.920 align:start position:0%
this is a fully transparent process that
 
00:55:12.789 --> 00:55:12.799 align:start position:0%
makes it easy to understand the choices
 
00:55:14.270 --> 00:55:14.280 align:start position:0%
that were made when identifying the
 
00:55:16.710 --> 00:55:16.720 align:start position:0%
Final maps therefore I urge you to vote
 
00:55:19.549 --> 00:55:19.559 align:start position:0%
out to pass on HB
 
00:55:22.109 --> 00:55:22.119 align:start position:0%

that got and I have to correct myself it
 
00:56:18.670 --> 00:56:18.680 align:start position:0%

00:56:51.750 --> 00:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
be the honorable Bob Perry and next time
 
00:56:53.470 --> 00:56:53.480 align:start position:0%
Mr Perry I don't refer to you as St of
 
00:56:54.789 --> 00:56:54.799 align:start position:0%
introducing yourself please feel free to
 
00:57:17.910 --> 00:57:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:21.750 --> 00:57:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:25.710 --> 00:57:25.720 align:start position:0%
committee I I speak in support of HB 363
 
00:57:28.750 --> 00:57:28.760 align:start position:0%
I will be very brief I did not intend to
 
00:57:30.670 --> 00:57:30.680 align:start position:0%
speak given personal time constraints
 
00:57:32.069 --> 00:57:32.079 align:start position:0%
but it was not enough for me to just
 
00:57:34.910 --> 00:57:34.920 align:start position:0%
sign the sheet in support my
 
00:57:37.750 --> 00:57:37.760 align:start position:0%
presentation on cacr 2 has a similar
 
00:57:40.349 --> 00:57:40.359 align:start position:0%
theme to it that is providing more
 
00:57:43.630 --> 00:57:43.640 align:start position:0%
detail for map designers and the courts
 
00:57:46.150 --> 00:57:46.160 align:start position:0%
but as a statute can be implemented much
 
00:57:48.950 --> 00:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
more quickly though subject to
 
00:57:52.349 --> 00:57:52.359 align:start position:0%
reversal indeed this bill at Roman 6 and
 
00:57:55.630 --> 00:57:55.640 align:start position:0%
Roman 7 contain similar language to that
 
00:57:58.829 --> 00:57:58.839 align:start position:0%
of CA ACR which addresses and is
 
00:58:01.109 --> 00:58:01.119 align:start position:0%
consistent with the concerns I raised in
 
00:58:01.119 --> 00:58:01.950 align:start position:0%
consistent with the concerns I raised in
the

00:58:01.950 --> 00:58:01.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:58:05.789 --> 00:58:05.799 align:start position:0%
cacr the last sentence in Roman 5 also
 
00:58:08.789 --> 00:58:08.799 align:start position:0%
relates to my presentation on the cacr
 
00:58:11.069 --> 00:58:11.079 align:start position:0%
and although not given its own Roman
 
00:58:13.750 --> 00:58:13.760 align:start position:0%
numeral here speaks to the detail needed
 
00:58:15.710 --> 00:58:15.720 align:start position:0%
for courts to understand the intent of
 
00:58:18.750 --> 00:58:18.760 align:start position:0%
the statute the intentional use of the
 
00:58:18.760 --> 00:58:19.710 align:start position:0%
the statute the intentional use of the
word

00:58:19.710 --> 00:58:19.720 align:start position:0%
word
 
00:58:22.829 --> 00:58:22.839 align:start position:0%
practicable at Roman 5 simply means map
 
00:58:25.270 --> 00:58:25.280 align:start position:0%
designers use their best efforts to
 
00:58:27.910 --> 00:58:27.920 align:start position:0%
comply given the complications of
 
00:58:31.150 --> 00:58:31.160 align:start position:0%
Designing Maps especially for house
 
00:58:33.430 --> 00:58:33.440 align:start position:0%
districts I hope the so-called New
 
00:58:35.390 --> 00:58:35.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Advantage will include passage
 
00:58:38.710 --> 00:58:38.720 align:start position:0%
of laws in the Gerry maning Arena that
 
00:58:41.910 --> 00:58:41.920 align:start position:0%
consider people before party passage of
 
00:58:43.710 --> 00:58:43.720 align:start position:0%
this bill would be an excellent
 
00:58:45.789 --> 00:58:45.799 align:start position:0%
beginning I urge

clerk uh role I've held since 2009 so
 
01:02:40.069 --> 01:02:40.079 align:start position:0%
I'd like to speak to you uh in favor of
 
01:02:42.430 --> 01:02:42.440 align:start position:0%
House Bill 356 I'm here representing
 
01:02:45.069 --> 01:02:45.079 align:start position:0%
myself by the way um enabling school
 
01:02:46.390 --> 01:02:46.400 align:start position:0%
districts to adopt partisan School
 
01:02:48.589 --> 01:02:48.599 align:start position:0%
District elections and really the
 
01:02:50.789 --> 01:02:50.799 align:start position:0%
purpose is is enabling legislation it
 
01:02:52.630 --> 01:02:52.640 align:start position:0%
lets school districts vote to see if
 
01:02:55.390 --> 01:02:55.400 align:start position:0%
they want partisan elections and so
 
01:02:58.150 --> 01:02:58.160 align:start position:0%
what's the motivation for this well
 
01:03:00.870 --> 01:03:00.880 align:start position:0%
first is increased voter engagement and
 
01:03:03.990 --> 01:03:04.000 align:start position:0%
turnout um nonpartisan Municipal and
 
01:03:05.589 --> 01:03:05.599 align:start position:0%
School District elections around the
 
01:03:08.430 --> 01:03:08.440 align:start position:0%
state have top have turnouts that top at
 
01:03:14.430 --> 01:03:14.440 align:start position:0%
25% maybe um 10 to 15% or less is common
 
01:03:15.990 --> 01:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
um the ones that have the higher
 
01:03:17.870 --> 01:03:17.880 align:start position:0%
turnouts tend to have SP2 voting because
 
01:03:20.829 --> 01:03:20.839 align:start position:0%
there's things to vote on um but if you
 
01:03:22.670 --> 01:03:22.680 align:start position:0%
look at partisan Statewide elections
 
01:03:24.829 --> 01:03:24.839 align:start position:0%
like in presidential elections in our in
 
01:03:27.589 --> 01:03:27.599 align:start position:0%
our uh midterm elections the voter
 
01:03:29.670 --> 01:03:29.680 align:start position:0%
turnouts two to three or four times
 
01:03:32.589 --> 01:03:32.599 align:start position:0%
higher um and you know we've had we had
 
01:03:34.910 --> 01:03:34.920 align:start position:0%
some recent ones that were 80 90% in the
 
01:03:38.190 --> 01:03:38.200 align:start position:0%
last in the 2024 election um part of the
 
01:03:40.069 --> 01:03:40.079 align:start position:0%
reason to that one of the big reasons is
 
01:03:41.630 --> 01:03:41.640 align:start position:0%
that partisan ballots have more
 
01:03:43.950 --> 01:03:43.960 align:start position:0%
information for voters they create more
 
01:03:46.870 --> 01:03:46.880 align:start position:0%
interest in turnout and most voters have
 
01:03:48.589 --> 01:03:48.599 align:start position:0%
a general idea if they don't who the
 
01:03:50.309 --> 01:03:50.319 align:start position:0%
candidate is they have general idea what
 
01:03:53.029 --> 01:03:53.039 align:start position:0%
a republican means what a Democrat means
 
01:03:54.549 --> 01:03:54.559 align:start position:0%
and they find this information useful in
 
01:03:56.950 --> 01:03:56.960 align:start position:0%
making their decision
 
01:04:00.190 --> 01:04:00.200 align:start position:0%
this bill also is sort of enabling at
 
01:04:02.750 --> 01:04:02.760 align:start position:0%
three levels the first level is it
 
01:04:05.069 --> 01:04:05.079 align:start position:0%
enables the school district to decide if
 
01:04:08.750 --> 01:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
they want to have the uh elections the
 
01:04:11.470 --> 01:04:11.480 align:start position:0%
second level is it enables the town uh
 
01:04:13.470 --> 01:04:13.480 align:start position:0%
committees the Republican Town committee
 
01:04:16.269 --> 01:04:16.279 align:start position:0%
and the Democrat Town committee to hold
 
01:04:18.390 --> 01:04:18.400 align:start position:0%
caucuses to nominate candidates for the
 
01:04:22.029 --> 01:04:22.039 align:start position:0%
school district offices this caucus is
 
01:04:24.870 --> 01:04:24.880 align:start position:0%
not mandatory it's optional so it's
 
01:04:26.510 --> 01:04:26.520 align:start position:0%
enabling each year
 
01:04:28.390 --> 01:04:28.400 align:start position:0%
um each Town party can decide if they
 
01:04:30.349 --> 01:04:30.359 align:start position:0%
want to have a caucus to nominate the
 
01:04:32.710 --> 01:04:32.720 align:start position:0%
caucus would be held in the January time
 
01:04:35.269 --> 01:04:35.279 align:start position:0%
frame I think it's six Fridays before
 
01:04:38.789 --> 01:04:38.799 align:start position:0%
the uh actual election is the deadline
 
01:04:40.589 --> 01:04:40.599 align:start position:0%
and um if candidates don't want to
 
01:04:42.349 --> 01:04:42.359 align:start position:0%
participate in the caucus or there isn't
 
01:04:44.510 --> 01:04:44.520 align:start position:0%
one they can actually self-nominate by
 
01:04:46.510 --> 01:04:46.520 align:start position:0%
getting 50 signatures from members of
 
01:04:49.750 --> 01:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
their party in order to get themselves
 
01:04:52.269 --> 01:04:52.279 align:start position:0%
nominated as a Republican or Democrat on
 
01:04:52.279 --> 01:04:53.510 align:start position:0%
nominated as a Republican or Democrat on
the

01:04:53.510 --> 01:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:04:56.150 --> 01:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
ballot the thing that's another in is
 
01:04:58.750 --> 01:04:58.760 align:start position:0%
that each individual candidate can
 
01:05:00.710 --> 01:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
decide if they want to be part of the
 
01:05:03.950 --> 01:05:03.960 align:start position:0%
partisan process so if this passed in a
 
01:05:06.309 --> 01:05:06.319 align:start position:0%
school district people could ignore it
 
01:05:08.309 --> 01:05:08.319 align:start position:0%
and just file as they do today they can
 
01:05:10.510 --> 01:05:10.520 align:start position:0%
stay as unaffiliated and they would be
 
01:05:12.829 --> 01:05:12.839 align:start position:0%
so on the ballot so really it's got a
 
01:05:14.549 --> 01:05:14.559 align:start position:0%
lot of choices for it and I think it's a
 
01:05:17.109 --> 01:05:17.119 align:start position:0%
good thing um if you have a partisan
 
01:05:18.710 --> 01:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
School District ballot it'll look a lot
 
01:05:20.190 --> 01:05:20.200 align:start position:0%
like our state ballots you have in
 
01:05:22.309 --> 01:05:22.319 align:start position:0%
November you'll have a republican column
 
01:05:24.750 --> 01:05:24.760 align:start position:0%
Democrat column and unaffiliated column
 
01:05:26.589 --> 01:05:26.599 align:start position:0%
that rotates by random ordering by the
 
01:05:28.150 --> 01:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State using the same
 
01:05:31.109 --> 01:05:31.119 align:start position:0%
process today um like to mention you
 
01:05:33.269 --> 01:05:33.279 align:start position:0%
know I've served on the school board um
 
01:05:36.230 --> 01:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
on a co-op School Board across two towns
 
01:05:38.069 --> 01:05:38.079 align:start position:0%
and while officially they're
 
01:05:40.630 --> 01:05:40.640 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan underneath they really are
 
01:05:42.829 --> 01:05:42.839 align:start position:0%
partisan in a lot of ways because a lot
 
01:05:45.029 --> 01:05:45.039 align:start position:0%
of the local education policy choices
 
01:05:47.309 --> 01:05:47.319 align:start position:0%
and budgeting choices are driven by
 
01:05:49.029 --> 01:05:49.039 align:start position:0%
partisan beliefs that's where people
 
01:05:50.829 --> 01:05:50.839 align:start position:0%
come from they have those biases and
 
01:05:54.150 --> 01:05:54.160 align:start position:0%
they have those beliefs so um a school
 
01:05:56.510 --> 01:05:56.520 align:start position:0%
board under elected also elected under
 
01:05:58.829 --> 01:05:58.839 align:start position:0%
partisan system can hold Pro caucuses
 
01:06:00.309 --> 01:06:00.319 align:start position:0%
just like you do in this committee and
 
01:06:02.309 --> 01:06:02.319 align:start position:0%
you do in the house and in the senate
 
01:06:04.750 --> 01:06:04.760 align:start position:0%
members of the party can have a break
 
01:06:07.630 --> 01:06:07.640 align:start position:0%
hold a private caucus to discuss issues
 
01:06:09.470 --> 01:06:09.480 align:start position:0%
I think that's valuable because as you
 
01:06:12.230 --> 01:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
know it helps organize and negotiate
 
01:06:14.589 --> 01:06:14.599 align:start position:0%
with the other side if you privately get
 
01:06:16.230 --> 01:06:16.240 align:start position:0%
together and you help find common ground
 
01:06:17.829 --> 01:06:17.839 align:start position:0%
so it's a useful
 
01:06:22.309 --> 01:06:22.319 align:start position:0%
tool um how familiar people are with the
 
01:06:24.510 --> 01:06:24.520 align:start position:0%
uh process of partisan elections they're
 
01:06:27.109 --> 01:06:27.119 align:start position:0%
already available for municipal uh
 
01:06:29.230 --> 01:06:29.240 align:start position:0%
purposes so you can do Municipal
 
01:06:32.069 --> 01:06:32.079 align:start position:0%
partisan elections so this law and this
 
01:06:34.309 --> 01:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
bill actually references a lot of that
 
01:06:37.109 --> 01:06:37.119 align:start position:0%
and adds to it uh as necessary for the
 
01:06:39.230 --> 01:06:39.240 align:start position:0%
specifics of a school district and I can
 
01:06:41.710 --> 01:06:41.720 align:start position:0%
answer questions more on partis
 
01:06:45.710 --> 01:06:45.720 align:start position:0%
elections if needed um we did find that
 
01:06:47.589 --> 01:06:47.599 align:start position:0%
there was a a small amendment that
 
01:06:50.829 --> 01:06:50.839 align:start position:0%
should be added to HB 356 I think it's
 
01:06:52.470 --> 01:06:52.480 align:start position:0%
already been filed by representative
 
01:06:55.109 --> 01:06:55.119 align:start position:0%
weary and it would be adding uh new
 
01:06:56.950 --> 01:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
section 7 to the bill which would
 
01:07:02.309 --> 01:07:02.319 align:start position:0%
basically update RSA 95 or 91a the about
 
01:07:04.430 --> 01:07:04.440 align:start position:0%
the right to know but just to add in
 
01:07:07.029 --> 01:07:07.039 align:start position:0%
that if there a if there's a caucus it
 
01:07:08.870 --> 01:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
could also include a school district
 
01:07:11.230 --> 01:07:11.240 align:start position:0%
caucus if it's elected on a partisan
 
01:07:13.230 --> 01:07:13.240 align:start position:0%
basis and also reference the new
 
01:07:15.829 --> 01:07:15.839 align:start position:0%
RSA so for those reasons I would
 
01:07:19.549 --> 01:07:19.559 align:start position:0%
recommend otpa on House Bill 356 to
 
01:07:22.230 --> 01:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
provide school districts local Town
 
01:07:24.510 --> 01:07:24.520 align:start position:0%
committees as well as individuals the
 
01:07:26.630 --> 01:07:26.640 align:start position:0%
option for partisan elections to help
 
01:07:29.910 --> 01:07:29.920 align:start position:0%
increase voter engagement and turnout
 
01:07:31.870 --> 01:07:31.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very much okay will you be
 
01:07:33.630 --> 01:07:33.640 align:start position:0%
taking questions yes I will are there
 
01:07:35.470 --> 01:07:35.480 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
01:07:38.069 --> 01:07:38.079 align:start position:0%
Lane thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:07:41.109 --> 01:07:41.119 align:start position:0%
for taking my question and normally I
 
01:07:43.510 --> 01:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't put somebody from the public
 
01:07:45.470 --> 01:07:45.480 align:start position:0%
necessarily to ask a lot of questions
 
01:07:48.670 --> 01:07:48.680 align:start position:0%
but um none of the sponsors are here
 
01:07:52.589 --> 01:07:52.599 align:start position:0%
so we've been hearing or we've heard
 
01:07:56.589 --> 01:07:56.599 align:start position:0%
several bills one bill that talked about
 
01:08:00.630 --> 01:08:00.640 align:start position:0%
a single a nonpartisan ballot a single
 
01:08:05.150 --> 01:08:05.160 align:start position:0%
ballot in order to decrease polarization
 
01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:06.150 align:start position:0%
ballot in order to decrease polarization
and

01:08:06.150 --> 01:08:06.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:08:08.589 --> 01:08:08.599 align:start position:0%
partisanship and was something that a
 
01:08:11.109 --> 01:08:11.119 align:start position:0%
lot of people wanted this spil kind and
 
01:08:13.549 --> 01:08:13.559 align:start position:0%
you had statistics so this bill kind of
 
01:08:16.189 --> 01:08:16.199 align:start position:0%
goes the opposite way it it says that
 
01:08:16.199 --> 01:08:18.030 align:start position:0%
goes the opposite way it it says that
increasing

01:08:18.030 --> 01:08:18.040 align:start position:0%
increasing
 
01:08:20.510 --> 01:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
partisanship increases
 
01:08:22.829 --> 01:08:22.839 align:start position:0%
participation and I'm just curious about
 
01:08:25.510 --> 01:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
your statistics versus the ones that
 
01:08:27.030 --> 01:08:27.040 align:start position:0%
we're hearing about the bill and where
 
01:08:28.910 --> 01:08:28.920 align:start position:0%
you got those and and frankly if you
 
01:08:30.269 --> 01:08:30.279 align:start position:0%
could repeat
 
01:08:33.189 --> 01:08:33.199 align:start position:0%
them well I mean I've looked across the
 
01:08:35.789 --> 01:08:35.799 align:start position:0%
state you know both in my community and
 
01:08:37.990 --> 01:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
in other uh communities and you see
 
01:08:42.349 --> 01:08:42.359 align:start position:0%
turnouts that are in the you know 10 15%
 
01:08:44.630 --> 01:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
range I think there was a bill in uh
 
01:08:46.110 --> 01:08:46.120 align:start position:0%
Municipal and County government that
 
01:08:48.309 --> 01:08:48.319 align:start position:0%
talked about not even passing a warrn
 
01:08:50.070 --> 01:08:50.080 align:start position:0%
article unless there was a certain
 
01:08:53.149 --> 01:08:53.159 align:start position:0%
percentage and it was like 15% so that
 
01:08:54.749 --> 01:08:54.759 align:start position:0%
was you know set that way because of
 
01:08:57.590 --> 01:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
that reason um because people don't know
 
01:09:00.669 --> 01:09:00.679 align:start position:0%
who the candidates are and you know
 
01:09:03.669 --> 01:09:03.679 align:start position:0%
that's a problem um with if you don't
 
01:09:07.349 --> 01:09:07.359 align:start position:0%
have this partisan uh ability and so I
 
01:09:09.669 --> 01:09:09.679 align:start position:0%
think having this as enabling
 
01:09:11.990 --> 01:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
legislation it lets each each Community
 
01:09:13.510 --> 01:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
can decide for themselves if it's a
 
01:09:17.110 --> 01:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
useful tool for them to adopt so if they
 
01:09:19.510 --> 01:09:19.520 align:start position:0%
if the if the majority of Voters in the
 
01:09:22.669 --> 01:09:22.679 align:start position:0%
school district want to have it they can
 
01:09:24.990 --> 01:09:25.000 align:start position:0%
vote for it and if they find later that
 
01:09:27.110 --> 01:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
they're not it's not working for them
 
01:09:30.709 --> 01:09:30.719 align:start position:0%
they can resend it um I do think that
 
01:09:32.870 --> 01:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
people don't like the term partisan it
 
01:09:35.430 --> 01:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
seems to be a a negative term to some
 
01:09:38.789 --> 01:09:38.799 align:start position:0%
people but partisan does give you uh an
 
01:09:40.749 --> 01:09:40.759 align:start position:0%
idea of the person's background and the
 
01:09:43.749 --> 01:09:43.759 align:start position:0%
person's you know General beliefs on how
 
01:09:45.349 --> 01:09:45.359 align:start position:0%
they're going to vote so it's more
 
01:09:48.229 --> 01:09:48.239 align:start position:0%
information for the voter so you you may
 
01:09:49.789 --> 01:09:49.799 align:start position:0%
not know the person's name but if you
 
01:09:51.349 --> 01:09:51.359 align:start position:0%
see they're a Democrat or you see
 
01:09:53.709 --> 01:09:53.719 align:start position:0%
they're a republican it provides more
 
01:09:56.110 --> 01:09:56.120 align:start position:0%
information and some people and I've
 
01:09:58.310 --> 01:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
talked to people in my town that says
 
01:10:00.510 --> 01:10:00.520 align:start position:0%
why do I vote I don't even know who the
 
01:10:02.550 --> 01:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
people are if I knew there was
 
01:10:04.790 --> 01:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
Republicans and Democrats I would
 
01:10:07.790 --> 01:10:07.800 align:start position:0%
actually be more interested in voting so
 
01:10:10.709 --> 01:10:10.719 align:start position:0%
um it's it's a little bit of uh I don't
 
01:10:12.790 --> 01:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
know if there's actual statistics on it
 
01:10:16.270 --> 01:10:16.280 align:start position:0%
but it's um something I've I've run into
 
01:10:17.669 --> 01:10:17.679 align:start position:0%
and I've talked to people across the
 
01:10:19.229 --> 01:10:19.239 align:start position:0%
state and it seems to be something
 
01:10:22.470 --> 01:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
that's um of interest and it's just an
 
01:10:24.669 --> 01:10:24.679 align:start position:0%
option and if you know if an individual
 
01:10:26.229 --> 01:10:26.239 align:start position:0%
candidate might be be a Republican and
 
01:10:27.870 --> 01:10:27.880 align:start position:0%
say I just still want to stay as an
 
01:10:30.350 --> 01:10:30.360 align:start position:0%
unaffiliated and they're not required to
 
01:10:32.149 --> 01:10:32.159 align:start position:0%
declare that they just file as they do
 
01:10:34.590 --> 01:10:34.600 align:start position:0%
today with the school district
 
01:10:37.430 --> 01:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
clerk um so they're not like I said it's
 
01:10:39.149 --> 01:10:39.159 align:start position:0%
enabling at many levels it's enabling
 
01:10:40.430 --> 01:10:40.440 align:start position:0%
for the the school district it's
 
01:10:42.870 --> 01:10:42.880 align:start position:0%
enabling for the town uh political
 
01:10:44.510 --> 01:10:44.520 align:start position:0%
parties and it's enabling for each
 
01:10:46.750 --> 01:10:46.760 align:start position:0%
individual so I think it just allows
 
01:10:48.950 --> 01:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
people to decide for themselves if it
 
01:10:50.590 --> 01:10:50.600 align:start position:0%
works for them thank
 
01:10:55.430 --> 01:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
you represent Gilmore thank you Mr chair
 
01:10:56.950 --> 01:10:56.960 align:start position:0%
okay my problem I'm looking for your
 
01:10:58.510 --> 01:10:58.520 align:start position:0%
thoughts on this my problem is in the
 
01:11:02.870 --> 01:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
city of Dober which I represent the um
 
01:11:05.590 --> 01:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
city um election is
 
01:11:08.910 --> 01:11:08.920 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan yet now we're introducing a
 
01:11:11.070 --> 01:11:11.080 align:start position:0%
partisan at which point in time the
 
01:11:14.630 --> 01:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
school board is also elected and I'm
 
01:11:16.550 --> 01:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
just seeing the problem here with having
 
01:11:19.550 --> 01:11:19.560 align:start position:0%
a partisan School Board election while
 
01:11:23.590 --> 01:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
you have a nonpartisan city election and
 
01:11:25.470 --> 01:11:25.480 align:start position:0%
I just curious of your thoughts thank
 
01:11:26.550 --> 01:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
you for the question representative
 
01:11:31.470 --> 01:11:31.480 align:start position:0%
Gilmore so um we have Town elections a
 
01:11:33.870 --> 01:11:33.880 align:start position:0%
lot of people have the March 11th I
 
01:11:35.110 --> 01:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
don't know where the cities have them
 
01:11:36.510 --> 01:11:36.520 align:start position:0%
they might have them at different times
 
01:11:38.830 --> 01:11:38.840 align:start position:0%
but on that day you're technically
 
01:11:40.709 --> 01:11:40.719 align:start position:0%
having multiple elections there are
 
01:11:44.629 --> 01:11:44.639 align:start position:0%
separate ballots so if you're in Dober
 
01:11:47.950 --> 01:11:47.960 align:start position:0%
say that your do voters wanted to have
 
01:11:49.990 --> 01:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
partisan School District elections that
 
01:11:51.910 --> 01:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
would be a partisan ballot for that one
 
01:11:53.830 --> 01:11:53.840 align:start position:0%
but maybe your your Municipal ballot
 
01:11:55.950 --> 01:11:55.960 align:start position:0%
would remain nonpartisan so it's a
 
01:11:58.149 --> 01:11:58.159 align:start position:0%
choice on each one you could have both
 
01:11:59.709 --> 01:11:59.719 align:start position:0%
of them nonpartisan as I think it is
 
01:12:02.149 --> 01:12:02.159 align:start position:0%
today or you could have one or either
 
01:12:04.149 --> 01:12:04.159 align:start position:0%
it's not required that they all have to
 
01:12:06.149 --> 01:12:06.159 align:start position:0%
do it at the same time they can each
 
01:12:08.470 --> 01:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
decide to do it as it makes sense for
 
01:12:11.830 --> 01:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
the community yeah just clar Dober in
 
01:12:13.709 --> 01:12:13.719 align:start position:0%
any municipality can adopt a partisan
 
01:12:15.669 --> 01:12:15.679 align:start position:0%
ballot system for their local election
 
01:12:17.270 --> 01:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
including the city of Dober if they
 
01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:18.470 align:start position:0%
including the city of Dober if they
chose

01:12:18.470 --> 01:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
chose
 
01:12:20.709 --> 01:12:20.719 align:start position:0%
to yes they
 
01:12:24.270 --> 01:12:24.280 align:start position:0%
can but now we're basically separating
 
01:12:26.910 --> 01:12:26.920 align:start position:0%
say can you adop one but not the other
 
01:12:28.709 --> 01:12:28.719 align:start position:0%
oh okay I see the point you're raising
 
01:12:31.750 --> 01:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
and um the issue also is the municipal
 
01:12:34.590 --> 01:12:34.600 align:start position:0%
election in do is in November at which
 
01:12:36.629 --> 01:12:36.639 align:start position:0%
point the school board is elected just
 
01:12:36.639 --> 01:12:37.950 align:start position:0%
point the school board is elected just
for

01:12:37.950 --> 01:12:37.960 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:12:41.790 --> 01:12:41.800 align:start position:0%
clarity each I just want to clarify so
 
01:12:43.950 --> 01:12:43.960 align:start position:0%
each the decide decision to make
 
01:12:45.750 --> 01:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
Municipal partisan elections is one
 
01:12:47.990 --> 01:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
decision with a separate warrant article
 
01:12:49.950 --> 01:12:49.960 align:start position:0%
in question and the decision to do a
 
01:12:52.030 --> 01:12:52.040 align:start position:0%
school district partisan election is a
 
01:12:53.470 --> 01:12:53.480 align:start position:0%
separate warn article and a question
 
01:12:55.510 --> 01:12:55.520 align:start position:0%
they're not necessarily related their
 
01:12:57.830 --> 01:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
independent decisions it can be proposed
 
01:13:00.590 --> 01:13:00.600 align:start position:0%
by voters or governing bodies further
 
01:13:01.750 --> 01:13:01.760 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
01:13:03.189 --> 01:13:03.199 align:start position:0%
representative wood I didn't see you com
 
01:13:05.430 --> 01:13:05.440 align:start position:0%
in I apologize yeah thank you Mr
 
01:13:07.270 --> 01:13:07.280 align:start position:0%
chairman and I apologize to you and the
 
01:13:09.270 --> 01:13:09.280 align:start position:0%
board for being late this morning I was
 
01:13:13.990 --> 01:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:16.470 --> 01:13:16.480 align:start position:0%
question what I wanted to know is you
 
01:13:20.110 --> 01:13:20.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier that you had data on
 
01:13:23.430 --> 01:13:23.440 align:start position:0%
um looking at the voting records of
 
01:13:25.430 --> 01:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
different towns partisan versus
 
01:13:27.350 --> 01:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan and I was wondering if you
 
01:13:28.870 --> 01:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
could submit that to the board if you
 
01:13:31.229 --> 01:13:31.239 align:start position:0%
have any data in writing I do not have
 
01:13:34.590 --> 01:13:34.600 align:start position:0%
data in writing um on partisan versus
 
01:13:37.750 --> 01:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan I just have some cursor uh
 
01:13:39.510 --> 01:13:39.520 align:start position:0%
looks at it but you can every time you
 
01:13:42.390 --> 01:13:42.400 align:start position:0%
look at a a turnout in any election
 
01:13:44.510 --> 01:13:44.520 align:start position:0%
that's a like a November election for
 
01:13:46.070 --> 01:13:46.080 align:start position:0%
the state when you're getting elected as
 
01:13:48.070 --> 01:13:48.080 align:start position:0%
representatives and the president
 
01:13:50.270 --> 01:13:50.280 align:start position:0%
Congress those numbers are always
 
01:13:52.229 --> 01:13:52.239 align:start position:0%
substantially higher than you'll see in
 
01:13:54.189 --> 01:13:54.199 align:start position:0%
any other municipal election I think our
 
01:13:55.669 --> 01:13:55.679 align:start position:0%
town clerk Brad
 
01:13:59.189 --> 01:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
when we get above 20% um and that's a
 
01:14:02.390 --> 01:14:02.400 align:start position:0%
fraction of what um you see um for
 
01:14:05.430 --> 01:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
everybody's reference um in my research
 
01:14:07.990 --> 01:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
I found that there is um one city that
 
01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:08.870 align:start position:0%
I found that there is um one city that
has

01:14:08.870 --> 01:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
has
 
01:14:11.830 --> 01:14:11.840 align:start position:0%
Municipal um partisan elections in the
 
01:14:13.910 --> 01:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
municipality is Portsmouth so they if
 
01:14:15.310 --> 01:14:15.320 align:start position:0%
you look at it they'll have RS and D's
 
01:14:19.709 --> 01:14:19.719 align:start position:0%
on their ballots so um it's out there um
 
01:14:22.350 --> 01:14:22.360 align:start position:0%
and but uh I think it you can't do it
 
01:14:23.470 --> 01:14:23.480 align:start position:0%
currently for school districts and
 
01:14:25.669 --> 01:14:25.679 align:start position:0%
that's the purpose of this bill
 
01:14:27.910 --> 01:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
is the chairman further qu yes for would
 
01:14:30.950 --> 01:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
followup please
 
01:14:34.149 --> 01:14:34.159 align:start position:0%
yep um from from the data that you look
 
01:14:35.790 --> 01:14:35.800 align:start position:0%
through what do you think would be the
 
01:14:38.510 --> 01:14:38.520 align:start position:0%
top reason for that big discrepancy 20
 
01:14:41.550 --> 01:14:41.560 align:start position:0%
80% people not voting uh what do what
 
01:14:44.550 --> 01:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
what do you think is the top thing I
 
01:14:46.149 --> 01:14:46.159 align:start position:0%
think thank you representative wood for
 
01:14:48.110 --> 01:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
the question I think that the major
 
01:14:50.310 --> 01:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
question is and I've heard from people
 
01:14:52.750 --> 01:14:52.760 align:start position:0%
is if you don't have S SP2 for your
 
01:14:54.189 --> 01:14:54.199 align:start position:0%
school district your town what do you
 
01:14:56.149 --> 01:14:56.159 align:start position:0%
you don't have much to vote vote on you
 
01:15:00.350 --> 01:15:00.360 align:start position:0%
do not have um a lot of contested races
 
01:15:02.310 --> 01:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
you don't even know who the candidates
 
01:15:04.750 --> 01:15:04.760 align:start position:0%
are it tends to be a lower profile so
 
01:15:07.189 --> 01:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
there's less information but even just
 
01:15:09.750 --> 01:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
having the RS and the D's for some of
 
01:15:11.350 --> 01:15:11.360 align:start position:0%
the candidates I think that provides
 
01:15:13.709 --> 01:15:13.719 align:start position:0%
information and motivation for voters
 
01:15:15.110 --> 01:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
because they'll feel like wow I can make
 
01:15:17.830 --> 01:15:17.840 align:start position:0%
a difference I have more information and
 
01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:18.669 align:start position:0%
a difference I have more information and
it's

01:15:18.669 --> 01:15:18.679 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:15:21.590 --> 01:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
available that's why people want to vote
 
01:15:22.830 --> 01:15:22.840 align:start position:0%
when they feel like there's something
 
01:15:24.310 --> 01:15:24.320 align:start position:0%
they can vote on and they understand it
 
01:15:25.790 --> 01:15:25.800 align:start position:0%
and they have the information so I think
 
01:15:29.229 --> 01:15:29.239 align:start position:0%
that's the reason for this thank you any
 
01:15:32.590 --> 01:15:32.600 align:start position:0%
further questions represent Nome thank
 
01:15:34.070 --> 01:15:34.080 align:start position:0%
you thank you for the qu for taking the
 
01:15:37.189 --> 01:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
question um am I right when you said
 
01:15:39.669 --> 01:15:39.679 align:start position:0%
that there's only one town or city that
 
01:15:43.430 --> 01:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
has adopted partisan elections that's
 
01:15:45.110 --> 01:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
what's I don't know representative I
 
01:15:46.430 --> 01:15:46.440 align:start position:0%
don't know if it's been done in the past
 
01:15:48.550 --> 01:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
that's the current status that I found
 
01:15:50.950 --> 01:15:50.960 align:start position:0%
yes okay thank you further questions
 
01:15:53.390 --> 01:15:53.400 align:start position:0%

um town and
 
01:16:36.830 --> 01:16:36.840 align:start position:0%
schools issues are generally considered
 
01:16:39.030 --> 01:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan and I think we should keep
 
01:16:40.149 --> 01:16:40.159 align:start position:0%
it that
 
01:16:42.870 --> 01:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
way if you think about the level of
 
01:16:44.910 --> 01:16:44.920 align:start position:0%
partisanship and the intensity of the
 
01:16:47.430 --> 01:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
vitriol that is going on right now do we
 
01:16:49.030 --> 01:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
really want to introduce more
 
01:16:51.310 --> 01:16:51.320 align:start position:0%
partisanship in our
 
01:16:55.189 --> 01:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
state going to ask that question really
 
01:16:55.199 --> 01:16:56.950 align:start position:0%
state going to ask that question really
second

01:16:56.950 --> 01:16:56.960 align:start position:0%

probably close to 2,000
people

01:17:17.350 --> 01:17:17.360 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:17:20.430 --> 01:17:20.440 align:start position:0%
and the biggest comment was they like to
 
01:17:23.110 --> 01:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
vote for the person not the
 
01:17:25.629 --> 01:17:25.639 align:start position:0%
party they like to vote for the person
 
01:17:28.270 --> 01:17:28.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:31.629 --> 01:17:31.639 align:start position:0%
party so keep that in
 
01:17:34.030 --> 01:17:34.040 align:start position:0%
mind also and I'm going I'm going to
 
01:17:35.870 --> 01:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
speak against the the uh there's a
 
01:17:38.470 --> 01:17:38.480 align:start position:0%
similar bill on on town is that whether
 
01:17:41.590 --> 01:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
the town needs a new plow truck isn't
 
01:17:46.310 --> 01:17:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:49.189 --> 01:17:49.199 align:start position:0%
issue and also as a conservative
 
01:17:50.669 --> 01:17:50.679 align:start position:0%
conservative Believe It or Not There are
 
01:17:55.189 --> 01:17:55.199 align:start position:0%
some of us conservative Democrats
 
01:17:57.470 --> 01:17:57.480 align:start position:0%
when it comes to spending some of the
 
01:17:58.870 --> 01:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
biggest spend thrifts I've ever seen on
 
01:18:01.550 --> 01:18:01.560 align:start position:0%
the budget committees are Republicans so
 
01:18:03.149 --> 01:18:03.159 align:start position:0%
this notion that somehow you're going to
 
01:18:05.709 --> 01:18:05.719 align:start position:0%
get a lot of information from the from
 
01:18:07.950 --> 01:18:07.960 align:start position:0%
the r or the D beside the person's name
 
01:18:10.430 --> 01:18:10.440 align:start position:0%
I think is can be called in
 
01:18:12.629 --> 01:18:12.639 align:start position:0%
question and then
 
01:18:15.070 --> 01:18:15.080 align:start position:0%
finally we have a hard time just finding
 
01:18:17.310 --> 01:18:17.320 align:start position:0%
candidates to run
 
01:18:19.270 --> 01:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
period how many more people are going to
 
01:18:21.430 --> 01:18:21.440 align:start position:0%
say do I really want to stand up there
 
01:18:23.550 --> 01:18:23.560 align:start position:0%
and put myself into this
 
01:18:26.350 --> 01:18:26.360 align:start position:0%
whole the this whole Whirlwind of
 
01:18:27.990 --> 01:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
partisan politics where I'm going to be
 
01:18:29.990 --> 01:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
attacked for being a Republican or I'm
 
01:18:32.669 --> 01:18:32.679 align:start position:0%
going to be attacked for being a
 
01:18:35.830 --> 01:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
Democrat think about
 
01:18:38.149 --> 01:18:38.159 align:start position:0%
that is this what you want to
 
01:18:42.149 --> 01:18:42.159 align:start position:0%
do I hope not because this is this is
 
01:18:44.390 --> 01:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
just going to further I think further
 
01:18:45.709 --> 01:18:45.719 align:start position:0%
The Divide in this country and we need
 
01:18:47.430 --> 01:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
healing in this country and we need
 
01:18:50.830 --> 01:18:50.840 align:start position:0%
healing and actually when I see how Town
 
01:18:52.550 --> 01:18:52.560 align:start position:0%
politics have worked in eping yeah the
 
01:18:54.229 --> 01:18:54.239 align:start position:0%
turnout is lower but it's a lot higher
 
01:18:56.709 --> 01:18:56.719 align:start position:0%
under spe too that it ever was as under
 
01:18:58.910 --> 01:18:58.920 align:start position:0%
under town meeting or School District
 
01:19:00.950 --> 01:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
meeting and we just everybody showed up
 
01:19:03.750 --> 01:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
one day you never had you never had a
 
01:19:05.870 --> 01:19:05.880 align:start position:0%
big turnout
 
01:19:08.350 --> 01:19:08.360 align:start position:0%
anyways so I think the argument about
 
01:19:12.070 --> 01:19:12.080 align:start position:0%
generating more turnout is specious that
 
01:19:14.070 --> 01:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
means I don't think it really holds
 
01:19:16.149 --> 01:19:16.159 align:start position:0%
water and when I see some of the other
 
01:19:17.910 --> 01:19:17.920 align:start position:0%
bills on elections coming out here I
 
01:19:21.189 --> 01:19:21.199 align:start position:0%
just see more of a a partisan lean on
 
01:19:21.199 --> 01:19:22.149 align:start position:0%
just see more of a a partisan lean on
trying

01:19:22.149 --> 01:19:22.159 align:start position:0%
trying
 
01:19:26.030 --> 01:19:26.040 align:start position:0%
to just introduce more partisanship
 
01:19:28.830 --> 01:19:28.840 align:start position:0%
um so I'll be back to talk against the
 
01:19:30.790 --> 01:19:30.800 align:start position:0%
town one I hopefully have more to say on
 
01:19:32.310 --> 01:19:32.320 align:start position:0%
that one but thank you very much all
 
01:19:35.310 --> 01:19:35.320 align:start position:0%
right will you be taking questions sure
 
01:19:39.189 --> 01:19:39.199 align:start position:0%
representative Gilmore oh back to Dober
 
01:19:42.669 --> 01:19:42.679 align:start position:0%
um so the go the municipal election in
 
01:19:45.870 --> 01:19:45.880 align:start position:0%
Dover is governed by the city Charter
 
01:19:48.790 --> 01:19:48.800 align:start position:0%
would this legislation take precedence
 
01:19:51.149 --> 01:19:51.159 align:start position:0%
over the city Charter that was adopted
 
01:19:53.830 --> 01:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
obviously by the people of do that's the
 
01:19:56.270 --> 01:19:56.280 align:start position:0%
question I don't know I'm not a lawyer
 
01:19:58.149 --> 01:19:58.159 align:start position:0%
me neither so I'm not going to say one
 
01:20:00.950 --> 01:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
way or the other I would think so but I
 
01:20:03.229 --> 01:20:03.239 align:start position:0%
mean that's just my guess uh further
 
01:20:06.350 --> 01:20:06.360 align:start position:0%
questions um I I have a I have a
 
01:20:08.870 --> 01:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
question so you said that unaffiliated
 
01:20:10.629 --> 01:20:10.639 align:start position:0%
voters represent the
 
01:20:13.189 --> 01:20:13.199 align:start position:0%
largest group but isn't it also true
 
01:20:15.430 --> 01:20:15.440 align:start position:0%
that Republicans and Democrats together
 
01:20:16.590 --> 01:20:16.600 align:start position:0%
there's more of them than there are on
 
01:20:18.070 --> 01:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
Affiliated voters so that the majority
 
01:20:19.669 --> 01:20:19.679 align:start position:0%
of Voters in New Hampshire are actually
 
01:20:19.679 --> 01:20:20.870 align:start position:0%
of Voters in New Hampshire are actually
partisan

01:20:20.870 --> 01:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
partisan
 
01:20:23.910 --> 01:20:23.920 align:start position:0%
voters it depends on which election
 
01:20:25.470 --> 01:20:25.480 align:start position:0%
you're you're looking
 
01:20:27.590 --> 01:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
the partisanship level goes up on
 
01:20:29.390 --> 01:20:29.400 align:start position:0%
presidential years and it goes down
 
01:20:31.189 --> 01:20:31.199 align:start position:0%
afterwards if you look at the records if
 
01:20:33.870 --> 01:20:33.880 align:start position:0%
you look at the numbers over the last 30
 
01:20:36.870 --> 01:20:36.880 align:start position:0%
years you'll you'll see that and I'm
 
01:20:38.070 --> 01:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
just going to come back to you and just
 
01:20:40.830 --> 01:20:40.840 align:start position:0%
say yeah do you want to see the kind of
 
01:20:43.669 --> 01:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
argument argumentation That's goes
 
01:20:46.110 --> 01:20:46.120 align:start position:0%
on that happens right now between
 
01:20:48.350 --> 01:20:48.360 align:start position:0%
Republicans and Democrats on the
 
01:20:50.189 --> 01:20:50.199 align:start position:0%
national level and at the state level
 
01:20:51.629 --> 01:20:51.639 align:start position:0%
and you want to bring that down to the
 
01:20:55.830 --> 01:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
to the local level then vote for it
 
01:20:58.430 --> 01:20:58.440 align:start position:0%
that's what you're asking for I'm saying
 
01:21:01.590 --> 01:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
is we need I I like Town politics in
 
01:21:04.790 --> 01:21:04.800 align:start position:0%
part because it doesn't matter what you
 
01:21:07.270 --> 01:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
are and if you go and you looked at the
 
01:21:09.750 --> 01:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
eping budget committee you'd be hard
 
01:21:13.430 --> 01:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:16.390 --> 01:21:16.400 align:start position:0%
what and that's a great thing in this
 
01:21:17.990 --> 01:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
day and age in
 
01:21:20.189 --> 01:21:20.199 align:start position:0%
2025 and so if you want to take that
 
01:21:22.390 --> 01:21:22.400 align:start position:0%
away then Vote for This
 
01:21:27.149 --> 01:21:27.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:28.910 --> 01:21:28.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
01:21:32.390 --> 01:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
representative um uh is the supervisor
 
01:21:36.629 --> 01:21:36.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:40.310 --> 01:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
public I think so yeah followup yes so
 
01:21:41.830 --> 01:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
if it's available for the public
 
01:21:44.430 --> 01:21:44.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't anybody be able to see how a
 
01:21:47.470 --> 01:21:47.480 align:start position:0%
candidate voted in the previous election
 
01:21:49.390 --> 01:21:49.400 align:start position:0%
yeah and also I mean it does come out I
 
01:21:51.629 --> 01:21:51.639 align:start position:0%
mean we have candidate forums and people
 
01:21:53.709 --> 01:21:53.719 align:start position:0%
show up in there and they can be asked a
 
01:21:55.990 --> 01:21:56.000 align:start position:0%
question about but guess what nobody's
 
01:21:58.669 --> 01:21:58.679 align:start position:0%
ever asked that question and I go back I
 
01:22:00.669 --> 01:22:00.679 align:start position:0%
mean I've been doing Town politics since
 
01:22:03.030 --> 01:22:03.040 align:start position:0%
I was 11 I've lived in the same town all
 
01:22:05.750 --> 01:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
my life and I've been to a lot of
 
01:22:07.750 --> 01:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
candidate forums and nobody's ever asked
 
01:22:09.750 --> 01:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
are you a Republican or a
 
01:22:12.229 --> 01:22:12.239 align:start position:0%
Democrat it's more about should we have
 
01:22:14.830 --> 01:22:14.840 align:start position:0%
the plow truck or not should we vote for
 
01:22:17.870 --> 01:22:17.880 align:start position:0%
the teachers contract or
 
01:22:21.189 --> 01:22:21.199 align:start position:0%
not oh get ribson
 
01:22:25.629 --> 01:22:25.639 align:start position:0%
qu thank you Mr chairman o sorry
 
01:22:27.950 --> 01:22:27.960 align:start position:0%
thank you um thank you for taking my
 
01:22:31.189 --> 01:22:31.199 align:start position:0%
question are you aware of any data that
 
01:22:33.510 --> 01:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
uh would give us some insight into how
 
01:22:36.189 --> 01:22:36.199 align:start position:0%
the political sympathies of Undeclared
 
01:22:39.110 --> 01:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
voters kind of uh play out in terms of
 
01:22:42.669 --> 01:22:42.679 align:start position:0%
party sympathy like polling or whatever
 
01:22:45.950 --> 01:22:45.960 align:start position:0%
so uh thank you for the question
 
01:22:49.550 --> 01:22:49.560 align:start position:0%
um you know it's it's knocking on doors
 
01:22:51.910 --> 01:22:51.920 align:start position:0%
talking to people so I mean how how it
 
01:22:54.149 --> 01:22:54.159 align:start position:0%
turns out for the voters that I I talk
 
01:22:54.159 --> 01:22:55.189 align:start position:0%
turns out for the voters that I I talk
to

01:22:55.189 --> 01:22:55.199 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:22:58.070 --> 01:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
um I mean one of the things I mean I do
 
01:23:00.189 --> 01:23:00.199 align:start position:0%
know people who do not like to be pigeon
 
01:23:01.470 --> 01:23:01.480 align:start position:0%
hold and they want to be able to vote
 
01:23:03.189 --> 01:23:03.199 align:start position:0%
for a republican when they think there's
 
01:23:04.750 --> 01:23:04.760 align:start position:0%
a good Republican in the primary to vote
 
01:23:05.790 --> 01:23:05.800 align:start position:0%
for and they want to be able to vote for
 
01:23:07.629 --> 01:23:07.639 align:start position:0%
a Democrat when there's a good Democrat
 
01:23:10.910 --> 01:23:10.920 align:start position:0%
in the primary um so I mean that's but
 
01:23:13.110 --> 01:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
that's definitely just observational and
 
01:23:16.390 --> 01:23:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:18.709 --> 01:23:18.719 align:start position:0%
imper okay go representative wood come
 
01:23:20.830 --> 01:23:20.840 align:start position:0%
back represent wood thank you Mr
 
01:23:22.030 --> 01:23:22.040 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
01:23:25.709 --> 01:23:25.719 align:start position:0%
question uh this bill does not mandator
 
01:23:28.110 --> 01:23:28.120 align:start position:0%
change the voting it's up to the
 
01:23:30.149 --> 01:23:30.159 align:start position:0%
district it just allows them to enable
 
01:23:32.470 --> 01:23:32.480 align:start position:0%
them why would we not want to give the
 
01:23:34.470 --> 01:23:34.480 align:start position:0%
towns the ability to make their own
 
01:23:37.149 --> 01:23:37.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:41.149 --> 01:23:41.159 align:start position:0%
this thank you that's a really good
 
01:23:43.430 --> 01:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
question so we want to have some towns
 
01:23:45.149 --> 01:23:45.159 align:start position:0%
to have partisan elections I I just
 
01:23:46.709 --> 01:23:46.719 align:start position:0%
think it's a really bad idea that we
 
01:23:48.709 --> 01:23:48.719 align:start position:0%
should just keep that off the table and
 
01:23:50.470 --> 01:23:50.480 align:start position:0%
if you do enabling legislation you put
 
01:23:53.110 --> 01:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
it on the table so in towns where some
 
01:23:54.550 --> 01:23:54.560 align:start position:0%
people really want to make part of
 
01:23:56.590 --> 01:23:56.600 align:start position:0%
Mischief then they may put that in and
 
01:23:57.470 --> 01:23:57.480 align:start position:0%
then all of a sudden I think you're
 
01:24:00.110 --> 01:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
going to see a different disc so I would
 
01:24:01.750 --> 01:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
just say leave it off the
 
01:24:05.149 --> 01:24:05.159 align:start position:0%
table further questions representative
 
01:24:07.390 --> 01:24:07.400 align:start position:0%
Lane thank you and thank you for taking
 
01:24:10.709 --> 01:24:10.719 align:start position:0%
my question
 
01:24:14.550 --> 01:24:14.560 align:start position:0%
um if we go this route and a town enacts
 
01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:15.350 align:start position:0%
um if we go this route and a town enacts
a

01:24:15.350 --> 01:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:24:19.390 --> 01:24:19.400 align:start position:0%
partisan uh election would that prevent
 
01:24:21.910 --> 01:24:21.920 align:start position:0%
an independent or an in unaffiliated
 
01:24:25.070 --> 01:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
person from running
 
01:24:26.590 --> 01:24:26.600 align:start position:0%
do you
 
01:24:29.110 --> 01:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
think well it says a message that I
 
01:24:31.070 --> 01:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
think it's it's I think it's I mean
 
01:24:32.149 --> 01:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
right now everybody runs as an
 
01:24:34.669 --> 01:24:34.679 align:start position:0%
independent right a local election so
 
01:24:37.990 --> 01:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
everyone's equal right and are are you
 
01:24:40.950 --> 01:24:40.960 align:start position:0%
aware that oh may you have F that's okay
 
01:24:44.629 --> 01:24:44.639 align:start position:0%
um are you aware that I when often when
 
01:24:47.870 --> 01:24:47.880 align:start position:0%
we recruit candidates um they are
 
01:24:50.910 --> 01:24:50.920 align:start position:0%
registered Independence so we have to go
 
01:24:52.790 --> 01:24:52.800 align:start position:0%
out they have to go out and change so
 
01:24:55.189 --> 01:24:55.199 align:start position:0%
that they can run because otherwise they
 
01:24:57.430 --> 01:24:57.440 align:start position:0%
would not be able to run I mean I don't
 
01:24:59.950 --> 01:24:59.960 align:start position:0%
know if you're aware of that fact or not
 
01:25:01.950 --> 01:25:01.960 align:start position:0%
I think it's I know that's true for
 
01:25:03.950 --> 01:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
state and uh State and national
 
01:25:06.629 --> 01:25:06.639 align:start position:0%
elections yeah that that is true okay
 
01:25:07.910 --> 01:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
thank you all right further questions
 
01:25:09.270 --> 01:25:09.280 align:start position:0%
for representative alone who will
 
01:25:10.750 --> 01:25:10.760 align:start position:0%
probably never come back to election off
 
01:25:10.760 --> 01:25:12.390 align:start position:0%
probably never come back to election off
for

01:25:12.390 --> 01:25:12.400 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:25:15.189 --> 01:25:15.199 align:start position:0%
this that was a joke it was not in it's
 
01:25:16.830 --> 01:25:16.840 align:start position:0%
and I would be back to this afternoon I
 
01:25:18.830 --> 01:25:18.840 align:start position:0%
know it was if you watch the Comm it was
 
01:25:20.070 --> 01:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
a tongue and- cheek comment it wasn't a
 
01:25:22.950 --> 01:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
derer statement um all right I think I
 
01:25:26.790 --> 01:25:26.800 align:start position:0%
don't have any more pink cards um
 
01:25:29.310 --> 01:25:29.320 align:start position:0%
online uh online but believe it or not
 
01:25:30.790 --> 01:25:30.800 align:start position:0%
for being a very partisan committee we
 
01:25:33.990 --> 01:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
usually get along pretty well um
 
01:25:36.990 --> 01:25:37.000 align:start position:0%
356 I already have open seven in support
 
01:25:40.470 --> 01:25:40.480 align:start position:0%

01:26:47.830 --> 01:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
representative Louise Andress I
 
01:26:49.990 --> 01:26:50.000 align:start position:0%

01:26:52.629 --> 01:26:52.639 align:start position:0%
andova Danbury Hill Salsbury and
 
01:26:56.149 --> 01:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
Webster I'm also Al a citizen in the
 
01:26:58.669 --> 01:26:58.679 align:start position:0%
town of Salsbury which is a part of the
 
01:27:00.709 --> 01:27:00.719 align:start position:0%
Mary ma Valley School District which
 
01:27:04.950 --> 01:27:04.960 align:start position:0%
includes the towns of bosne Lowden Penny
 
01:27:07.990 --> 01:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
cook Webster and
 
01:27:10.750 --> 01:27:10.760 align:start position:0%
Salsbury I have been involved real good
 
01:27:15.109 --> 01:27:15.119 align:start position:0%
totals when it comes to voting so I went
 
01:27:17.510 --> 01:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
into so I went
 
01:27:21.070 --> 01:27:21.080 align:start position:0%
into the SAU office last year after the
 
01:27:22.950 --> 01:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
election and I've done it
 
01:27:26.950 --> 01:27:26.960 align:start position:0%
before and just for curiosity I
 
01:27:31.629 --> 01:27:31.639 align:start position:0%
counted Salsbury in Salsbury 61 people
 
01:27:36.030 --> 01:27:36.040 align:start position:0%
voted for the Schoolboard
 
01:27:41.390 --> 01:27:41.400 align:start position:0%
candidates and yet there were
 
01:27:46.430 --> 01:27:46.440 align:start position:0%
45 votes for the candidates in
 
01:27:49.350 --> 01:27:49.360 align:start position:0%
Salsbury one thing it happens here with
 
01:27:53.350 --> 01:27:53.360 align:start position:0%
a small town like us we only about a th
 
01:27:56.229 --> 01:27:56.239 align:start position:0%
voters May more or less I think I know
 
01:27:58.550 --> 01:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
there's more but when you get into the
 
01:28:01.430 --> 01:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
bigger towns they have
 
01:28:05.910 --> 01:28:05.920 align:start position:0%
253,000 voters and there's no
 
01:28:08.990 --> 01:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
way with all the towns
 
01:28:12.030 --> 01:28:12.040 align:start position:0%
voting for the
 
01:28:14.590 --> 01:28:14.600 align:start position:0%
candidates that a small town even a
 
01:28:17.750 --> 01:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
bigger Town last year the town of Lowden
 
01:28:22.070 --> 01:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
had a very viable young candidate they
 
01:28:25.910 --> 01:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
worked very hard but there's no way
 
01:28:28.750 --> 01:28:28.760 align:start position:0%
because the whole District voted for for
 
01:28:31.629 --> 01:28:31.639 align:start position:0%
the candidates in in in the town Alden
 
01:28:34.270 --> 01:28:34.280 align:start position:0%
there's no way they could get him into
 
01:28:38.669 --> 01:28:38.679 align:start position:0%
office I don't know if it's viable to be
 
01:28:41.350 --> 01:28:41.360 align:start position:0%
able to make it so that or if it's even
 
01:28:44.830 --> 01:28:44.840 align:start position:0%
legal that you can each vote in your own
 
01:28:47.270 --> 01:28:47.280 align:start position:0%
town for your school board members and
 
01:28:50.189 --> 01:28:50.199 align:start position:0%
the other towns can't but I really wish
 
01:28:52.669 --> 01:28:52.679 align:start position:0%
the com committee would consider it
 
01:28:52.679 --> 01:28:54.189 align:start position:0%
the com committee would consider it
seriously

01:28:54.189 --> 01:28:54.199 align:start position:0%
seriously
 
01:28:57.510 --> 01:28:57.520 align:start position:0%
as many people in our towns would like
 
01:28:58.910 --> 01:28:58.920 align:start position:0%
to vote for their candidate and they
 
01:29:01.189 --> 01:29:01.199 align:start position:0%
don't want anybody else voting for them
 
01:29:02.870 --> 01:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
and that's all I have to say about it
 
01:29:02.880 --> 01:29:03.910 align:start position:0%
and that's all I have to say about it
thank

01:29:03.910 --> 01:29:03.920 align:start position:0%

01:29:11.629 --> 01:29:11.639 align:start position:0%

01:29:42.790 --> 01:29:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:44.950 --> 01:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
do thank you again election law
 
01:29:47.390 --> 01:29:47.400 align:start position:0%
committee and Mr chair again I'm Eric
 
01:29:48.550 --> 01:29:48.560 align:start position:0%
power from
 
01:29:51.750 --> 01:29:51.760 align:start position:0%
Brookline um representing myself I'm the
 
01:29:53.149 --> 01:29:53.159 align:start position:0%
president of the school district
 
01:29:55.550 --> 01:29:55.560 align:start position:0%
governance Association of New Hampshire
 
01:29:58.030 --> 01:29:58.040 align:start position:0%
and also uh I served on the Hollis
 
01:30:00.470 --> 01:30:00.480 align:start position:0%
Brookline Cooperative school board for a
 
01:30:02.510 --> 01:30:02.520 align:start position:0%
three-year term so I'm familiar with
 
01:30:04.550 --> 01:30:04.560 align:start position:0%
Cooperative school boards Cooperative
 
01:30:05.950 --> 01:30:05.960 align:start position:0%
school boards should be cooperative
 
01:30:06.910 --> 01:30:06.920 align:start position:0%
among the
 
01:30:10.390 --> 01:30:10.400 align:start position:0%
towns um I was in a two-town um
 
01:30:12.430 --> 01:30:12.440 align:start position:0%
Cooperative School District with
 
01:30:15.750 --> 01:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
Brookline being smaller than Hollis and
 
01:30:20.149 --> 01:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
um we do it I think the right way where
 
01:30:22.510 --> 01:30:22.520 align:start position:0%
there's three school board members from
 
01:30:24.709 --> 01:30:24.719 align:start position:0%
Brookline and there's four Schoolboard
 
01:30:27.870 --> 01:30:27.880 align:start position:0%
members from Hollis so a seven total but
 
01:30:29.750 --> 01:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
only the Brookline voters vote for the
 
01:30:31.669 --> 01:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
Brookline representatives and only the
 
01:30:33.990 --> 01:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
hollus voters vote for the hollus
 
01:30:35.950 --> 01:30:35.960 align:start position:0%
representatives and I think that makes a
 
01:30:37.629 --> 01:30:37.639 align:start position:0%
lot of sense but there are school
 
01:30:39.189 --> 01:30:39.199 align:start position:0%
districts and I think I've heard of a
 
01:30:43.149 --> 01:30:43.159 align:start position:0%
couple like Hillsboro Dearing and um
 
01:30:47.350 --> 01:30:47.360 align:start position:0%
also I think in exer Regional where all
 
01:30:49.790 --> 01:30:49.800 align:start position:0%
the voters in the entire Co-op vote for
 
01:30:53.510 --> 01:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
each Town's um representative so if
 
01:30:54.990 --> 01:30:55.000 align:start position:0%
you're from
 
01:30:57.070 --> 01:30:57.080 align:start position:0%
Brentwood the brenwood people vote for
 
01:30:58.629 --> 01:30:58.639 align:start position:0%
you but so do all the people in exiter
 
01:31:00.629 --> 01:31:00.639 align:start position:0%
and everything so same thing at
 
01:31:02.950 --> 01:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro Dearing you know the Deering
 
01:31:05.750 --> 01:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
reps are voted by everyone and that's
 
01:31:07.229 --> 01:31:07.239 align:start position:0%
kind of a problem I think if you're a
 
01:31:08.950 --> 01:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
small town and I think representative
 
01:31:11.790 --> 01:31:11.800 align:start position:0%
Andrew was speaking to this why wouldn't
 
01:31:13.990 --> 01:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
just the voters from your town be able
 
01:31:17.310 --> 01:31:17.320 align:start position:0%
to vote for your representative
 
01:31:20.750 --> 01:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
otherwise um you're going to get the the
 
01:31:23.950 --> 01:31:23.960 align:start position:0%
the pr preference of the larger town
 
01:31:26.390 --> 01:31:26.400 align:start position:0%
dominating and deluding the vote and you
 
01:31:28.189 --> 01:31:28.199 align:start position:0%
wouldn't really have a representative
 
01:31:30.629 --> 01:31:30.639 align:start position:0%
you have one from your town but you
 
01:31:32.870 --> 01:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
don't really have the M you don't it's
 
01:31:34.270 --> 01:31:34.280 align:start position:0%
not really selected by the people in
 
01:31:36.550 --> 01:31:36.560 align:start position:0%
your town so I think you have a couple
 
01:31:38.270 --> 01:31:38.280 align:start position:0%
bills in election law this is one of
 
01:31:40.310 --> 01:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
them um I think this makes a lot of
 
01:31:44.070 --> 01:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
sense so this would say basically um if
 
01:31:46.629 --> 01:31:46.639 align:start position:0%
you're from Dearing only the Deering
 
01:31:49.590 --> 01:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
voters would vote for you not everybody
 
01:31:51.470 --> 01:31:51.480 align:start position:0%
in the whole Co-op and I think that
 
01:31:53.990 --> 01:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
makes a lot of sense in order to really
 
01:31:55.709 --> 01:31:55.719 align:start position:0%
make the co-op cooperative and and it's
 
01:31:58.709 --> 01:31:58.719 align:start position:0%
a matter of fairness um that that that
 
01:32:00.750 --> 01:32:00.760 align:start position:0%
happens so I think that you know I would
 
01:32:02.709 --> 01:32:02.719 align:start position:0%
recommend this bill I I support this
 
01:32:05.149 --> 01:32:05.159 align:start position:0%
bill and it would correct some of the
 
01:32:06.629 --> 01:32:06.639 align:start position:0%
unfairness that you've seen across the
 
01:32:07.950 --> 01:32:07.960 align:start position:0%
state I think this bill has come up in
 
01:32:09.870 --> 01:32:09.880 align:start position:0%
the past but this is uh I think this is
 
01:32:13.070 --> 01:32:13.080 align:start position:0%
a good solution thank you very much okay
 
01:32:14.030 --> 01:32:14.040 align:start position:0%
will you be taking questions from the
 
01:32:16.430 --> 01:32:16.440 align:start position:0%
committee yes I will uh representative
 
01:32:19.149 --> 01:32:19.159 align:start position:0%
wood yes you mentioned uh two different
 
01:32:21.990 --> 01:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
situations one Cooperative where they
 
01:32:25.070 --> 01:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
were voting individually and and one
 
01:32:28.390 --> 01:32:28.400 align:start position:0%
that um represent Andrew mentioned um
 
01:32:30.750 --> 01:32:30.760 align:start position:0%
wasn't the same do you know the is there
 
01:32:32.510 --> 01:32:32.520 align:start position:0%
a legal reason for this a structural
 
01:32:34.510 --> 01:32:34.520 align:start position:0%
reason do you know what the why there's
 
01:32:34.520 --> 01:32:35.590 align:start position:0%
reason do you know what the why there's
different

01:32:35.590 --> 01:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:32:37.390 --> 01:32:37.400 align:start position:0%
situations thank you for the question
 
01:32:40.109 --> 01:32:40.119 align:start position:0%
representative wood yes there is um it's
 
01:32:43.350 --> 01:32:43.360 align:start position:0%
it's a decision in uh RSA
 
01:32:46.390 --> 01:32:46.400 align:start position:0%
195 um where there's a there's about
 
01:32:48.510 --> 01:32:48.520 align:start position:0%
five or six different options in
 
01:32:52.430 --> 01:32:52.440 align:start position:0%
selecting it and you know when they form
 
01:32:54.790 --> 01:32:54.800 align:start position:0%
a co-op you're deciding which one you
 
01:32:58.430 --> 01:32:58.440 align:start position:0%
want but that can be amended and um but
 
01:33:01.669 --> 01:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
I think the ones that have this I don't
 
01:33:04.430 --> 01:33:04.440 align:start position:0%
think it's really a fair method and the
 
01:33:07.590 --> 01:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
problem is unless the legislature acts
 
01:33:10.709 --> 01:33:10.719 align:start position:0%
the Big Town has the power and do they
 
01:33:12.390 --> 01:33:12.400 align:start position:0%
want to give it up and allow it to be
 
01:33:14.229 --> 01:33:14.239 align:start position:0%
changed in their articles of agreement
 
01:33:15.790 --> 01:33:15.800 align:start position:0%
which is sort of the Constitution of the
 
01:33:17.790 --> 01:33:17.800 align:start position:0%
co-op they're not going to ever do that
 
01:33:18.990 --> 01:33:19.000 align:start position:0%
they're never going to want to give up
 
01:33:20.629 --> 01:33:20.639 align:start position:0%
their power they get to vote if they're
 
01:33:22.030 --> 01:33:22.040 align:start position:0%
a big town they get to vote for the
 
01:33:24.790 --> 01:33:24.800 align:start position:0%
people from the little towns and you
 
01:33:26.350 --> 01:33:26.360 align:start position:0%
know they get to pick who's on the
 
01:33:29.350 --> 01:33:29.360 align:start position:0%
school board but I think it's a it's
 
01:33:31.270 --> 01:33:31.280 align:start position:0%
unfair to little towns for that to work
 
01:33:32.830 --> 01:33:32.840 align:start position:0%
that way so I think that's why this
 
01:33:35.590 --> 01:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
legislation is important so that little
 
01:33:37.830 --> 01:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
towns actually have a voice in a co-op
 
01:33:39.390 --> 01:33:39.400 align:start position:0%
it's it's almost impossible to get out
 
01:33:42.270 --> 01:33:42.280 align:start position:0%
of a co-op um withdrawals are very
 
01:33:43.709 --> 01:33:43.719 align:start position:0%
difficult that's a whole another issue
 
01:33:46.430 --> 01:33:46.440 align:start position:0%
but um even making a change like to an
 
01:33:48.550 --> 01:33:48.560 align:start position:0%
articles of agreement is a majority vote
 
01:33:50.070 --> 01:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
across the co-op and it's never going to
 
01:33:52.550 --> 01:33:52.560 align:start position:0%
go through with the Big Town maintaining
 
01:33:54.910 --> 01:33:54.920 align:start position:0%
their power and you know that's the way
 
01:33:56.950 --> 01:33:56.960 align:start position:0%
that's just the way people are thank you
 
01:33:58.310 --> 01:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions from the
 
01:33:59.510 --> 01:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
01:34:01.790 --> 01:34:01.800 align:start position:0%
C thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:34:04.790 --> 01:34:04.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question um in some districts
 
01:34:07.430 --> 01:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
including March Valley school district
 
01:34:11.149 --> 01:34:11.159 align:start position:0%
there are both uh Town selected
 
01:34:12.990 --> 01:34:13.000 align:start position:0%
Representatives or at least the person
 
01:34:15.109 --> 01:34:15.119 align:start position:0%
has to reside in the town but there are
 
01:34:17.430 --> 01:34:17.440 align:start position:0%
also some at large districts that go
 
01:34:21.189 --> 01:34:21.199 align:start position:0%
over uh more than one town do you see
 
01:34:24.070 --> 01:34:24.080 align:start position:0%
that as a a uh an issue that would still
 
01:34:28.950 --> 01:34:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:31.510 --> 01:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
large interesting question I think you
 
01:34:33.950 --> 01:34:33.960 align:start position:0%
could still keep an at large and then
 
01:34:37.470 --> 01:34:37.480 align:start position:0%
the only the voters in that at large
 
01:34:39.669 --> 01:34:39.679 align:start position:0%
District would vote for that person it
 
01:34:41.189 --> 01:34:41.199 align:start position:0%
would be sort of like state
 
01:34:42.669 --> 01:34:42.679 align:start position:0%
representative some state
 
01:34:45.790 --> 01:34:45.800 align:start position:0%
representatives only represent one town
 
01:34:47.830 --> 01:34:47.840 align:start position:0%
but some state representatives represent
 
01:34:50.030 --> 01:34:50.040 align:start position:0%
three towns but you don't have people
 
01:34:52.430 --> 01:34:52.440 align:start position:0%
outside of those three towns voting for
 
01:34:53.750 --> 01:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
that so I think that that that's
 
01:34:56.510 --> 01:34:56.520 align:start position:0%
workable um with the at large districts
 
01:34:58.310 --> 01:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
like the March uh
 
01:35:04.430 --> 01:35:04.440 align:start position:0%
Valley thank further questions repr Lan
 
01:35:08.030 --> 01:35:08.040 align:start position:0%
um is this a way to have I guess what I
 
01:35:12.990 --> 01:35:13.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:15.510 --> 01:35:15.520 align:start position:0%
voting um representative L I'm not sure
 
01:35:16.750 --> 01:35:16.760 align:start position:0%
if I understand the question about
 
01:35:19.149 --> 01:35:19.159 align:start position:0%
proportional voting but it would
 
01:35:21.550 --> 01:35:21.560 align:start position:0%
basically you know a lot of the co-ops
 
01:35:25.590 --> 01:35:25.600 align:start position:0%
will have so many um they're required
 
01:35:27.109 --> 01:35:27.119 align:start position:0%
and this also gets approved by the State
 
01:35:28.830 --> 01:35:28.840 align:start position:0%
Board of Education when they set up a
 
01:35:31.350 --> 01:35:31.360 align:start position:0%
Cooperative or Regional School District
 
01:35:33.910 --> 01:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
they have to have the one man one vote
 
01:35:36.790 --> 01:35:36.800 align:start position:0%
rule so they do have to apportion the
 
01:35:39.910 --> 01:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
representatives based on the uh the
 
01:35:41.790 --> 01:35:41.800 align:start position:0%
popul the voting populations in each of
 
01:35:43.990 --> 01:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
the towns so that's where that happens
 
01:35:46.149 --> 01:35:46.159 align:start position:0%
when you have that um that's how it's
 
01:35:49.109 --> 01:35:49.119 align:start position:0%
done the second level is who are the
 
01:35:52.270 --> 01:35:52.280 align:start position:0%
ones that vote for those so you know
 
01:35:54.070 --> 01:35:54.080 align:start position:0%
maybe in the exiter they might have
 
01:35:57.109 --> 01:35:57.119 align:start position:0%
Brentwood might have one rep yes they
 
01:35:58.629 --> 01:35:58.639 align:start position:0%
have one rep and that will person will
 
01:36:00.310 --> 01:36:00.320 align:start position:0%
have to be from Brentwood but who votes
 
01:36:02.149 --> 01:36:02.159 align:start position:0%
for that person is the question is it
 
01:36:03.790 --> 01:36:03.800 align:start position:0%
only the people in brenwood that's the
 
01:36:05.070 --> 01:36:05.080 align:start position:0%
secondary question that's what's being
 
01:36:07.709 --> 01:36:07.719 align:start position:0%
solved by this bill or is it everybody
 
01:36:09.470 --> 01:36:09.480 align:start position:0%
in the whole exitor Regional Co-op that
 
01:36:11.550 --> 01:36:11.560 align:start position:0%
votes for the BR the the Brentwood rep
 
01:36:13.510 --> 01:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
so that's that's how that would work
 
01:36:15.310 --> 01:36:15.320 align:start position:0%
thank you that's very helpful okay thank
 
01:36:19.030 --> 01:36:19.040 align:start position:0%
you so further questions um so I this is
 
01:36:20.510 --> 01:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
not an area that we deal with much in
 
01:36:23.310 --> 01:36:23.320 align:start position:0%
election law so we're I had to read 195
 
01:36:27.070 --> 01:36:27.080 align:start position:0%
which is is not an RSA 600 so my brain
 
01:36:28.629 --> 01:36:28.639 align:start position:0%
immedately stopped so what I'm looking
 
01:36:30.750 --> 01:36:30.760 align:start position:0%
at is there's basically five different
 
01:36:33.070 --> 01:36:33.080 align:start position:0%
methods the school district can choose
 
01:36:35.629 --> 01:36:35.639 align:start position:0%
to elect to to to figure out their
 
01:36:38.030 --> 01:36:38.040 align:start position:0%
composition for their school board right
 
01:36:40.149 --> 01:36:40.159 align:start position:0%
and what this bill is trying to Target
 
01:36:42.310 --> 01:36:42.320 align:start position:0%
and I don't know if this is properly
 
01:36:45.189 --> 01:36:45.199 align:start position:0%
worded um but with just so understand
 
01:36:46.430 --> 01:36:46.440 align:start position:0%
that the problem this is trying to
 
01:36:46.440 --> 01:36:47.830 align:start position:0%
that the problem this is trying to
resolve

01:36:47.830 --> 01:36:47.840 align:start position:0%
resolve
 
01:36:50.189 --> 01:36:50.199 align:start position:0%
so at
 
01:36:52.310 --> 01:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
large at large to be voted on by
 
01:36:53.910 --> 01:36:53.920 align:start position:0%
everybody if you're if you're an large
 
01:36:55.470 --> 01:36:55.480 align:start position:0%
District like I think everybody here
 
01:36:57.790 --> 01:36:57.800 align:start position:0%
understands that concept but there's a
 
01:36:59.870 --> 01:36:59.880 align:start position:0%
it looks
 
01:37:05.310 --> 01:37:05.320 align:start position:0%
like4 as a option for composition allows
 
01:37:09.709 --> 01:37:09.719 align:start position:0%
for a board where it mandates that a
 
01:37:11.430 --> 01:37:11.440 align:start position:0%
person has to come from a
 
01:37:14.350 --> 01:37:14.360 align:start position:0%
town but members from another town can
 
01:37:16.149 --> 01:37:16.159 align:start position:0%
vote for that person from that town and
 
01:37:17.709 --> 01:37:17.719 align:start position:0%
this bill is trying to say no no no if
 
01:37:19.149 --> 01:37:19.159 align:start position:0%
you're going to go that method that only
 
01:37:21.709 --> 01:37:21.719 align:start position:0%
the members of that town can vote for
 
01:37:24.189 --> 01:37:24.199 align:start position:0%
that member um
 
01:37:25.669 --> 01:37:25.679 align:start position:0%
like that's the intent that's what it's
 
01:37:28.030 --> 01:37:28.040 align:start position:0%
trying to get to right it's not it's not
 
01:37:29.750 --> 01:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
trying to say because I think there's a
 
01:37:31.030 --> 01:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
way this could be read that say it's
 
01:37:32.870 --> 01:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
like if you're running at large that
 
01:37:34.310 --> 01:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
only the people in your town could vote
 
01:37:37.030 --> 01:37:37.040 align:start position:0%
for you um which I I I I don't think
 
01:37:37.990 --> 01:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
that's the intention of it but I think
 
01:37:40.830 --> 01:37:40.840 align:start position:0%
it could be read like that right like
 
01:37:42.669 --> 01:37:42.679 align:start position:0%
that's the point you're trying to get at
 
01:37:44.950 --> 01:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
yes I I agree with you okay all right
 
01:37:46.430 --> 01:37:46.440 align:start position:0%
all right thank you that that I just
 
01:37:48.270 --> 01:37:48.280 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure I think if we
 
01:37:49.990 --> 01:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
forward this this probably needs to be
 
01:37:52.070 --> 01:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
reworked on language you I think but um
 
01:37:53.950 --> 01:37:53.960 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
01:37:56.390 --> 01:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
hearing none thank you um and late entry
 
01:38:07.229 --> 01:38:07.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:10.430 --> 01:38:10.440 align:start position:0%
Horan so I'm I'm resident Timothy Horan
 
01:38:12.430 --> 01:38:12.440 align:start position:0%
from Strafford County District 10 which
 
01:38:14.830 --> 01:38:14.840 align:start position:0%
is a uh one-town district with four
 
01:38:16.629 --> 01:38:16.639 align:start position:0%
members representing the town of Durham
 
01:38:19.390 --> 01:38:19.400 align:start position:0%
um it's part of the oyster Cooperative
 
01:38:21.310 --> 01:38:21.320 align:start position:0%
school district and actually my first
 
01:38:23.950 --> 01:38:23.960 align:start position:0%
term I represent a state leg legislative
 
01:38:25.790 --> 01:38:25.800 align:start position:0%
district which for some bizarre reason
 
01:38:29.870 --> 01:38:29.880 align:start position:0%
was uh exactly Co exactly coterminous
 
01:38:31.149 --> 01:38:31.159 align:start position:0%
with the school district which is
 
01:38:32.910 --> 01:38:32.920 align:start position:0%
something that hasn't happened in the
 
01:38:36.950 --> 01:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
last two desial cycles I've been here uh
 
01:38:39.470 --> 01:38:39.480 align:start position:0%
I've been here since two s my when I
 
01:38:40.950 --> 01:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
started running that was like my
 
01:38:44.870 --> 01:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
district was based on the 2000 census um
 
01:38:47.589 --> 01:38:47.599 align:start position:0%
and um so we have the system where there
 
01:38:50.390 --> 01:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
some seats that are uh designated for
 
01:38:52.910 --> 01:38:52.920 align:start position:0%
the for the uh smaller towns in the
 
01:38:54.830 --> 01:38:54.840 align:start position:0%
district and I'm I live in the largest
 
01:38:57.430 --> 01:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
town so I may be prejudiced but I I
 
01:38:59.629 --> 01:38:59.639 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily think that it's unfair
 
01:39:03.070 --> 01:39:03.080 align:start position:0%
that the voters in the larger town have
 
01:39:05.910 --> 01:39:05.920 align:start position:0%
more influence because uh this is a
 
01:39:08.149 --> 01:39:08.159 align:start position:0%
democracy and there's a lot more of us
 
01:39:10.270 --> 01:39:10.280 align:start position:0%
in my town than the others and in any
 
01:39:11.790 --> 01:39:11.800 align:start position:0%
case I'm not sure if there's that much
 
01:39:16.390 --> 01:39:16.400 align:start position:0%
conflict between Durham Lee and Madbury
 
01:39:18.910 --> 01:39:18.920 align:start position:0%
um over what school I mean there's a lot
 
01:39:20.709 --> 01:39:20.719 align:start position:0%
of controversy over how the school dist
 
01:39:22.430 --> 01:39:22.440 align:start position:0%
run but I don't think like the people in
 
01:39:24.910 --> 01:39:24.920 align:start position:0%
Madbury have that much a different
 
01:39:26.709 --> 01:39:26.719 align:start position:0%
opinion about how the school district
 
01:39:29.790 --> 01:39:29.800 align:start position:0%
should be run than those in in Lee um
 
01:39:31.550 --> 01:39:31.560 align:start position:0%
Madbury has about I think probably about
 
01:39:35.070 --> 01:39:35.080 align:start position:0%
5% of the population Durham has you know
 
01:39:37.350 --> 01:39:37.360 align:start position:0%
poke about six two-thirds of it and then
 
01:39:38.870 --> 01:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
Lee has what's left over so I don't
 
01:39:39.990 --> 01:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
think there's actually a lot of
 
01:39:41.149 --> 01:39:41.159 align:start position:0%
difference in how the people in the
 
01:39:43.070 --> 01:39:43.080 align:start position:0%
three towns feel about educational
 
01:39:47.109 --> 01:39:47.119 align:start position:0%
policy so I I'm not sure um so I'm not
 
01:39:50.229 --> 01:39:50.239 align:start position:0%
sure why uh Madbury just because it's
 
01:39:51.589 --> 01:39:51.599 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure whether they're mberry even
 
01:39:52.870 --> 01:39:52.880 align:start position:0%
though there's few of them feel any
 
01:39:54.629 --> 01:39:54.639 align:start position:0%
differently than the people in Lee or
 
01:39:58.030 --> 01:39:58.040 align:start position:0%
Durham so I and um so I think it's you
 
01:40:01.550 --> 01:40:01.560 align:start position:0%
get huge um and know as you know Mr
 
01:40:03.589 --> 01:40:03.599 align:start position:0%
chair being on having been on the rition
 
01:40:06.910 --> 01:40:06.920 align:start position:0%
there's huge uh one person one vote the
 
01:40:09.830 --> 01:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
statistical part of that is extremely
 
01:40:11.790 --> 01:40:11.800 align:start position:0%
extremely important and like very
 
01:40:13.270 --> 01:40:13.280 align:start position:0%
difficult to deal with and this creates
 
01:40:15.910 --> 01:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
humongous uh one person one vote issues
 
01:40:17.229 --> 01:40:17.239 align:start position:0%
because the way I read in my school
 
01:40:20.070 --> 01:40:20.080 align:start position:0%
district they kept it same the voters in
 
01:40:22.950 --> 01:40:22.960 align:start position:0%
Madbury would be and there's nothing I
 
01:40:24.870 --> 01:40:24.880 align:start position:0%
love m adbury I Wish I Still represented
 
01:40:27.070 --> 01:40:27.080 align:start position:0%
I love campaign there but I'm not sure
 
01:40:27.080 --> 01:40:28.030 align:start position:0%
I love campaign there but I'm not sure
like

01:40:28.030 --> 01:40:28.040 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:40:31.470 --> 01:40:31.480 align:start position:0%
whether they deserve you know whe 5% of
 
01:40:33.229 --> 01:40:33.239 align:start position:0%
the population should have like you know
 
01:40:35.350 --> 01:40:35.360 align:start position:0%
whatever it is 15 you know they would
 
01:40:37.109 --> 01:40:37.119 align:start position:0%
have like it would call create huge
 
01:40:38.990 --> 01:40:39.000 align:start position:0%
disproportionality for the smaller towns
 
01:40:42.990 --> 01:40:43.000 align:start position:0%
in the district and um and um so I I
 
01:40:45.750 --> 01:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
also so I think this is a this is a bad
 
01:40:47.510 --> 01:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
I think this is a bad Bill going to
 
01:40:49.070 --> 01:40:49.080 align:start position:0%
create it'll probably be challenging
 
01:40:51.149 --> 01:40:51.159 align:start position:0%
courts cre to create massive one person
 
01:40:53.589 --> 01:40:53.599 align:start position:0%
one vote problems and I'm not sure if
 
01:40:56.189 --> 01:40:56.199 align:start position:0%
it's really necessary most
 
01:41:00.070 --> 01:41:00.080 align:start position:0%
cases um and also course the other of
 
01:41:01.950 --> 01:41:01.960 align:start position:0%
course it's uh also probably will point
 
01:41:04.669 --> 01:41:04.679 align:start position:0%
out is you you hinted at uh this is kind
 
01:41:07.149 --> 01:41:07.159 align:start position:0%
of an unusual assignment for committee
 
01:41:09.070 --> 01:41:09.080 align:start position:0%
this issue would usually turn up in uh
 
01:41:10.870 --> 01:41:10.880 align:start position:0%
either Municipal and County government
 
01:41:13.750 --> 01:41:13.760 align:start position:0%
or education policy and administration
 
01:41:15.229 --> 01:41:15.239 align:start position:0%
why they dumped it on you when you got
 
01:41:19.470 --> 01:41:19.480 align:start position:0%
plenty of votes so I don't know so so I
 
01:41:22.350 --> 01:41:22.360 align:start position:0%
think um yeah so Al I'll also say I
 
01:41:24.270 --> 01:41:24.280 align:start position:0%
think the way this bills written the
 
01:41:25.990 --> 01:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
wording of it is kind of questionable so
 
01:41:27.709 --> 01:41:27.719 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how that affects the at
 
01:41:30.229 --> 01:41:30.239 align:start position:0%
large districts um you know the at large
 
01:41:32.270 --> 01:41:32.280 align:start position:0%
members so I
 
01:41:37.109 --> 01:41:37.119 align:start position:0%
I'm um so I I CH one one extending St in
 
01:41:40.149 --> 01:41:40.159 align:start position:0%
my school district is that uh the
 
01:41:42.430 --> 01:41:42.440 align:start position:0%
largest Elementary School that serves uh
 
01:41:44.790 --> 01:41:44.800 align:start position:0%
Durham is actually located uh just over
 
01:41:46.830 --> 01:41:46.840 align:start position:0%
the Border within the borders of the
 
01:41:50.350 --> 01:41:50.360 align:start position:0%
town of Madbury and also a large number
 
01:41:51.990 --> 01:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
of the elementary school students go to
 
01:41:55.669 --> 01:41:55.679 align:start position:0%
the mway school in in in Lee so you know
 
01:41:57.950 --> 01:41:57.960 align:start position:0%
the uh end Durham does currently does
 
01:42:00.390 --> 01:42:00.400 align:start position:0%
not actually have an elementary school
 
01:42:03.470 --> 01:42:03.480 align:start position:0%
so that maybe makes finds the three
 
01:42:05.070 --> 01:42:05.080 align:start position:0%
towns more closely together than they
 
01:42:06.750 --> 01:42:06.760 align:start position:0%
might be otherwise so I I would just
 
01:42:09.350 --> 01:42:09.360 align:start position:0%
urge you uh either have to totally
 
01:42:11.870 --> 01:42:11.880 align:start position:0%
rewrite this bill or uh just probably
 
01:42:14.270 --> 01:42:14.280 align:start position:0%
the better alternative just itl it or
 
01:42:15.830 --> 01:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
you can probably also refer it over
 
01:42:17.669 --> 01:42:17.679 align:start position:0%
Municipal and county or educational
 
01:42:19.669 --> 01:42:19.679 align:start position:0%
policy Administration and let them deal
 
01:42:21.430 --> 01:42:21.440 align:start position:0%
with it
 
01:42:24.270 --> 01:42:24.280 align:start position:0%
so I I certainly
 
01:42:26.189 --> 01:42:26.199 align:start position:0%
I certainly you know I've been voting
 
01:42:28.669 --> 01:42:28.679 align:start position:0%
for The Madbury and Lee Representatives
 
01:42:30.310 --> 01:42:30.320 align:start position:0%
as a resident of Durham and I think I've
 
01:42:32.750 --> 01:42:32.760 align:start position:0%
made uh reasonably good reasonably I
 
01:42:34.229 --> 01:42:34.239 align:start position:0%
think I've made good choices I think the
 
01:42:37.070 --> 01:42:37.080 align:start position:0%
people we've chosen aren't any better
 
01:42:38.629 --> 01:42:38.639 align:start position:0%
aren't any worse than they would be if
 
01:42:40.270 --> 01:42:40.280 align:start position:0%
only Lee was voting for that Lee
 
01:42:44.229 --> 01:42:44.239 align:start position:0%
representative mberry right so thanks
 
01:42:45.390 --> 01:42:45.400 align:start position:0%
will you be taking questions from the
 
01:42:47.270 --> 01:42:47.280 align:start position:0%

01:43:16.470 --> 01:43:16.480 align:start position:0%

it what it does is it change it makes
 
01:44:40.629 --> 01:44:40.639 align:start position:0%
the method for adopting partisan Town
 
01:44:43.709 --> 01:44:43.719 align:start position:0%
elections the same as the way to resend
 
01:44:47.350 --> 01:44:47.360 align:start position:0%
them so under current law the uh the way
 
01:44:50.790 --> 01:44:50.800 align:start position:0%
to adopt a the partisan Town elections
 
01:44:53.550 --> 01:44:53.560 align:start position:0%
is via uh a warn article
 
01:44:55.270 --> 01:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
and if you're at the traditional meeting
 
01:44:57.750 --> 01:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a a traditional meeting
 
01:45:01.470 --> 01:45:01.480 align:start position:0%
uh uh warant article if you have S SP2
 
01:45:03.550 --> 01:45:03.560 align:start position:0%
then it goes to the deliberative session
 
01:45:05.629 --> 01:45:05.639 align:start position:0%
and then goes on to the official ballot
 
01:45:06.950 --> 01:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
on Election
 
01:45:11.390 --> 01:45:11.400 align:start position:0%
Day um if you have already have partisan
 
01:45:16.790 --> 01:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
elections today you um you you have it's
 
01:45:19.750 --> 01:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
it's required to be to resend it uh to
 
01:45:21.790 --> 01:45:21.800 align:start position:0%
go back to nonpartisan it has to be an
 
01:45:23.750 --> 01:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
official ballot question whether you're
 
01:45:25.870 --> 01:45:25.880 align:start position:0%
in sb2 or you're in a traditional
 
01:45:30.350 --> 01:45:30.360 align:start position:0%
meeting so um what this bill is doing is
 
01:45:32.510 --> 01:45:32.520 align:start position:0%
it's just making it the same going both
 
01:45:35.149 --> 01:45:35.159 align:start position:0%
directions so it says that if you want
 
01:45:38.030 --> 01:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
to adopt partisan elections that it
 
01:45:39.589 --> 01:45:39.599 align:start position:0%
becomes an official ballot question it
 
01:45:41.430 --> 01:45:41.440 align:start position:0%
goes on the ballot on Election Day
 
01:45:42.709 --> 01:45:42.719 align:start position:0%
whether you have a traditional meeting
 
01:45:45.390 --> 01:45:45.400 align:start position:0%
or sb2 for the voters to
 
01:45:49.030 --> 01:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
decide um and the same as you do today
 
01:45:51.510 --> 01:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
for the um
 
01:45:53.950 --> 01:45:53.960 align:start position:0%
resending the other thing that's
 
01:45:57.070 --> 01:45:57.080 align:start position:0%
important is that there are a number of
 
01:45:58.669 --> 01:45:58.679 align:start position:0%
official ballot questions you may be
 
01:46:00.990 --> 01:46:01.000 align:start position:0%
Familiar of of things that are required
 
01:46:02.470 --> 01:46:02.480 align:start position:0%
to be official ballot questions that
 
01:46:05.470 --> 01:46:05.480 align:start position:0%
have to do with elections if you want to
 
01:46:07.229 --> 01:46:07.239 align:start position:0%
elect your planning board and I
 
01:46:08.790 --> 01:46:08.800 align:start position:0%
mentioned I serve on the planning board
 
01:46:10.990 --> 01:46:11.000 align:start position:0%
we we've we've transitioned recently
 
01:46:13.350 --> 01:46:13.360 align:start position:0%
from appointed to elected that's an
 
01:46:14.950 --> 01:46:14.960 align:start position:0%
official ballot question it goes on the
 
01:46:16.669 --> 01:46:16.679 align:start position:0%
ballot for all voters to decide and our
 
01:46:19.070 --> 01:46:19.080 align:start position:0%
and our voters decided overwhelmingly to
 
01:46:21.189 --> 01:46:21.199 align:start position:0%
go that way and then the following year
 
01:46:22.910 --> 01:46:22.920 align:start position:0%
we there's an official ballot question
 
01:46:24.669 --> 01:46:24.679 align:start position:0%
question for the Zoning Board of
 
01:46:26.870 --> 01:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
adjustment overwhelmingly the voters
 
01:46:28.709 --> 01:46:28.719 align:start position:0%
voted for that that was on the official
 
01:46:31.550 --> 01:46:31.560 align:start position:0%
ballot um there's also one for the
 
01:46:33.189 --> 01:46:33.199 align:start position:0%
Conservation Commission if you want to
 
01:46:34.830 --> 01:46:34.840 align:start position:0%
change your Conservation Commission from
 
01:46:36.870 --> 01:46:36.880 align:start position:0%
appointed to elected that's an official
 
01:46:38.189 --> 01:46:38.199 align:start position:0%
ballot question because it deals with
 
01:46:40.310 --> 01:46:40.320 align:start position:0%
the election so it makes a lot of sense
 
01:46:41.990 --> 01:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
when you're dealing with an election
 
01:46:45.390 --> 01:46:45.400 align:start position:0%
issue for it to be also an uh an
 
01:46:49.310 --> 01:46:49.320 align:start position:0%
official ballot question and um so that
 
01:46:51.830 --> 01:46:51.840 align:start position:0%
way it would enable the voters that
 
01:46:53.750 --> 01:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
there's many more voters that vote on
 
01:46:55.189 --> 01:46:55.199 align:start position:0%
Town election and School district
 
01:46:58.870 --> 01:46:58.880 align:start position:0%
election day than do on uh the go to the
 
01:47:01.390 --> 01:47:01.400 align:start position:0%
annual meetings or the deliberative
 
01:47:05.030 --> 01:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
session so this just makes it uh a much
 
01:47:07.950 --> 01:47:07.960 align:start position:0%
better option for uh choosing this and
 
01:47:10.229 --> 01:47:10.239 align:start position:0%
making it the same to choose to have
 
01:47:12.270 --> 01:47:12.280 align:start position:0%
partisan elections or to
 
01:47:17.030 --> 01:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:18.830 --> 01:47:18.840 align:start position:0%
testimony are there question are you
 
01:47:20.629 --> 01:47:20.639 align:start position:0%
taking questions Mr power yes I will are
 
01:47:23.070 --> 01:47:23.080 align:start position:0%
there questions from the committee
 
01:47:26.470 --> 01:47:26.480 align:start position:0%
representative Lane um again I thank you
 
01:47:28.550 --> 01:47:28.560 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um I think as our
 
01:47:30.430 --> 01:47:30.440 align:start position:0%
chair recommended we don't see these
 
01:47:32.310 --> 01:47:32.320 align:start position:0%
kind of bills very often so it's a
 
01:47:35.510 --> 01:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
little bit of an education for us so I
 
01:47:38.629 --> 01:47:38.639 align:start position:0%
guess I'm reading the existing statute
 
01:47:41.589 --> 01:47:41.599 align:start position:0%
and it says that the town can adopt the
 
01:47:45.149 --> 01:47:45.159 align:start position:0%
partisan official ballot system under an
 
01:47:47.870 --> 01:47:47.880 align:start position:0%
article in the warrant for any town
 
01:47:51.149 --> 01:47:51.159 align:start position:0%
meeting and may resend such action in
 
01:47:53.750 --> 01:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
like manner
 
01:47:56.629 --> 01:47:56.639 align:start position:0%
so the purpose of this bill I
 
01:48:00.790 --> 01:48:00.800 align:start position:0%
thought was for the method for adopting
 
01:48:03.750 --> 01:48:03.760 align:start position:0%
it to be the same as resending it don't
 
01:48:05.790 --> 01:48:05.800 align:start position:0%
we already have that if I'm reading the
 
01:48:08.390 --> 01:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
existing statute
 
01:48:10.629 --> 01:48:10.639 align:start position:0%
correctly so representative Lane I do
 
01:48:12.510 --> 01:48:12.520 align:start position:0%
not believe the current statute is
 
01:48:14.510 --> 01:48:14.520 align:start position:0%
consistent I know you find might find
 
01:48:17.750 --> 01:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
that shocking but
 
01:48:20.390 --> 01:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
uh this is a bill and I did a little
 
01:48:22.790 --> 01:48:22.800 align:start position:0%
research on this that was written in 197
 
01:48:25.990 --> 01:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
79 it was House Bill
 
01:48:28.430 --> 01:48:28.440 align:start position:0%
766 um by representative Ramsey of
 
01:48:32.870 --> 01:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
Stratford 13 I did
 
01:48:36.030 --> 01:48:36.040 align:start position:0%
766 House Bill 766 in
 
01:48:38.350 --> 01:48:38.360 align:start position:0%
1979 that's that's the year of the bills
 
01:48:41.430 --> 01:48:41.440 align:start position:0%
in April of 1979 I that's older than the
 
01:48:43.750 --> 01:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
online archive so I had to go to the UNH
 
01:48:46.669 --> 01:48:46.679 align:start position:0%
online to find it uh the scanned version
 
01:48:49.589 --> 01:48:49.599 align:start position:0%
and they did a good job actually um and
 
01:48:52.109 --> 01:48:52.119 align:start position:0%
so this bill has not this part of the
 
01:48:54.109 --> 01:48:54.119 align:start position:0%
bill hasn't been changed since
 
01:48:57.189 --> 01:48:57.199 align:start position:0%
1979 and um as a piece piece of
 
01:48:59.669 --> 01:48:59.679 align:start position:0%
Education they used to talk there was a
 
01:49:01.589 --> 01:49:01.599 align:start position:0%
number of bills when I was looking in
 
01:49:04.430 --> 01:49:04.440 align:start position:0%
1979 they were talking about large towns
 
01:49:07.709 --> 01:49:07.719 align:start position:0%
being 4500 so there was a lot of 4500s
 
01:49:09.950 --> 01:49:09.960 align:start position:0%
of population were a lot of bills in
 
01:49:12.510 --> 01:49:12.520 align:start position:0%
election law and in other places that
 
01:49:14.550 --> 01:49:14.560 align:start position:0%
were was used and over the years that
 
01:49:17.790 --> 01:49:17.800 align:start position:0%
has disappeared except for in two places
 
01:49:21.830 --> 01:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
one of them is in this bill um is in uh
 
01:49:26.350 --> 01:49:26.360 align:start position:0%
RSA 66 6913 and the other one is in RSA
 
01:49:30.669 --> 01:49:30.679 align:start position:0%
23162 B which has to do with electing
 
01:49:32.149 --> 01:49:32.159 align:start position:0%
whether you want to elect a highway
 
01:49:33.830 --> 01:49:33.840 align:start position:0%
agent for two or three years believe it
 
01:49:36.990 --> 01:49:37.000 align:start position:0%
or not and they made a differentiation
 
01:49:40.229 --> 01:49:40.239 align:start position:0%
uh there between a a town that's 4500 or
 
01:49:42.709 --> 01:49:42.719 align:start position:0%
larger or not so there down to two
 
01:49:45.550 --> 01:49:45.560 align:start position:0%
places where the 4500 has not been
 
01:49:48.589 --> 01:49:48.599 align:start position:0%
amended uh out and OB obviously New
 
01:49:50.470 --> 01:49:50.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has grown a lot since
 
01:49:53.430 --> 01:49:53.440 align:start position:0%
1979 so what's consistent here it would
 
01:49:55.589 --> 01:49:55.599 align:start position:0%
basically there was this is the existing
 
01:49:59.870 --> 01:49:59.880 align:start position:0%
law so it's saying um that if you uh
 
01:50:01.629 --> 01:50:01.639 align:start position:0%
have a large town then you have to to
 
01:50:04.070 --> 01:50:04.080 align:start position:0%
resend it by the ballot which doesn't
 
01:50:05.830 --> 01:50:05.840 align:start position:0%
make sense because most towns that are
 
01:50:08.270 --> 01:50:08.280 align:start position:0%
4500 wouldn't be considered large today
 
01:50:12.030 --> 01:50:12.040 align:start position:0%
in in um New Hampshire so this actually
 
01:50:14.310 --> 01:50:14.320 align:start position:0%
does make it the an official ballot
 
01:50:15.870 --> 01:50:15.880 align:start position:0%
question going both directions
 
01:50:17.470 --> 01:50:17.480 align:start position:0%
regardless of the size of town it makes
 
01:50:20.910 --> 01:50:20.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of sense and uh brings us you know
 
01:50:23.790 --> 01:50:23.800 align:start position:0%
brings us consistency I think previously
 
01:50:26.669 --> 01:50:26.679 align:start position:0%
or the current law it would depend you
 
01:50:29.550 --> 01:50:29.560 align:start position:0%
know you would you would weend it by a
 
01:50:30.950 --> 01:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
warrant article I guess if you have less
 
01:50:33.350 --> 01:50:33.360 align:start position:0%
than 4,500 residents but if it was
 
01:50:35.270 --> 01:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
greater than 4500 you have the official
 
01:50:37.430 --> 01:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
ballot for some reason so I don't know
 
01:50:40.910 --> 01:50:40.920 align:start position:0%
why that's the case um somebody in 1979
 
01:50:42.430 --> 01:50:42.440 align:start position:0%
thought that was a good idea but I think
 
01:50:44.149 --> 01:50:44.159 align:start position:0%
it just makes sense to have an official
 
01:50:46.669 --> 01:50:46.679 align:start position:0%
ballot question to adopt and an official
 
01:50:50.149 --> 01:50:50.159 align:start position:0%
ballot question to resend because it is
 
01:50:52.030 --> 01:50:52.040 align:start position:0%
an it does affect the election so it
 
01:50:53.589 --> 01:50:53.599 align:start position:0%
makes a lot of sense for voters to weigh
 
01:50:56.109 --> 01:50:56.119 align:start position:0%
on that like you choose to elect your
 
01:50:57.709 --> 01:50:57.719 align:start position:0%
planning board Zoning Board of
 
01:50:59.910 --> 01:50:59.920 align:start position:0%
adjustment and Conservation Commission
 
01:50:59.920 --> 01:51:01.709 align:start position:0%
adjustment and Conservation Commission
thank

01:51:01.709 --> 01:51:01.719 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:51:04.430 --> 01:51:04.440 align:start position:0%
you question representative
 
01:51:06.629 --> 01:51:06.639 align:start position:0%
Burnham thank you Mr Powers for taking
 
01:51:09.510 --> 01:51:09.520 align:start position:0%
my question thank you Mr chairman um I
 
01:51:12.830 --> 01:51:12.840 align:start position:0%
just uh have a question if when these uh
 
01:51:15.310 --> 01:51:15.320 align:start position:0%
petition warn articles uh including
 
01:51:15.320 --> 01:51:16.350 align:start position:0%
petition warn articles uh including
these

01:51:16.350 --> 01:51:16.360 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:51:20.669 --> 01:51:20.679 align:start position:0%
RSA uh laws uh are received at the
 
01:51:23.390 --> 01:51:23.400 align:start position:0%
deliberative session does it give
 
01:51:26.430 --> 01:51:26.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity for people in the audience
 
01:51:30.830 --> 01:51:30.840 align:start position:0%
to provide an amendment changing actual
 
01:51:32.589 --> 01:51:32.599 align:start position:0%
statute thank you for the question
 
01:51:34.750 --> 01:51:34.760 align:start position:0%
representative Burnham I believe that's
 
01:51:37.709 --> 01:51:37.719 align:start position:0%
a gray area but I think it's more clear
 
01:51:41.510 --> 01:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
that any um warrant article that's
 
01:51:43.270 --> 01:51:43.280 align:start position:0%
required to be an official ballot
 
01:51:47.750 --> 01:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
question should not be amended um at the
 
01:51:50.149 --> 01:51:50.159 align:start position:0%
deliberative session think about this
 
01:51:52.790 --> 01:51:52.800 align:start position:0%
for a second um if you have an off
 
01:51:54.149 --> 01:51:54.159 align:start position:0%
ballot question and you have a
 
01:51:55.430 --> 01:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
deliberative session now you're saying
 
01:51:57.750 --> 01:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
they can modify it but what if you have
 
01:51:59.390 --> 01:51:59.400 align:start position:0%
a traditional meeting it just goes right
 
01:52:01.270 --> 01:52:01.280 align:start position:0%
onto the ballot and there's no
 
01:52:03.669 --> 01:52:03.679 align:start position:0%
opportunity so I think the intent and
 
01:52:05.229 --> 01:52:05.239 align:start position:0%
this is probably a municipal and County
 
01:52:07.350 --> 01:52:07.360 align:start position:0%
government question more than election
 
01:52:10.510 --> 01:52:10.520 align:start position:0%
law but um I think that it makes sense
 
01:52:12.069 --> 01:52:12.079 align:start position:0%
that if something's prescribed as an
 
01:52:14.149 --> 01:52:14.159 align:start position:0%
official ballot question it should maybe
 
01:52:16.229 --> 01:52:16.239 align:start position:0%
be debated at a deliberative session but
 
01:52:18.390 --> 01:52:18.400 align:start position:0%
not amended I think that's the proper
 
01:52:19.830 --> 01:52:19.840 align:start position:0%
way to go and I would say that would be
 
01:52:21.390 --> 01:52:21.400 align:start position:0%
the same for this law here that we're
 
01:52:23.030 --> 01:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
talking about thank you further
 
01:52:25.189 --> 01:52:25.199 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee saying none
 
01:52:28.589 --> 01:52:28.599 align:start position:0%
thank you um next up is representative
 
01:52:30.750 --> 01:52:30.760 align:start position:0%
vone and I don't have any other pink
 
01:52:33.910 --> 01:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
cards for 367 so representative gasowski
 
01:52:39.830 --> 01:52:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:43.390 --> 01:52:43.400 align:start position:0%
me thank you Mr chairman mark vone from
 
01:52:46.030 --> 01:52:46.040 align:start position:0%
Rockingham 5 eeping this is going to be
 
01:52:48.990 --> 01:52:49.000 align:start position:0%
really brief because this
 
01:52:51.910 --> 01:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
bill I'm not losing sleep over this bill
 
01:52:55.030 --> 01:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
as as I was over the school Bill however
 
01:52:57.870 --> 01:52:57.880 align:start position:0%
I and I I unfortunately not able to be
 
01:53:01.149 --> 01:53:01.159 align:start position:0%
here all day but I would be uh
 
01:53:03.270 --> 01:53:03.280 align:start position:0%
commenting on the number of partisan
 
01:53:08.470 --> 01:53:08.480 align:start position:0%
bills that look to highlight partisan
 
01:53:11.870 --> 01:53:11.880 align:start position:0%
elections and to restrict the vote of
 
01:53:15.229 --> 01:53:15.239 align:start position:0%
Independence I'm going to uh your
 
01:53:18.470 --> 01:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
hb220 so my concern here today is that
 
01:53:23.870 --> 01:53:23.880 align:start position:0%
we don't need more partisanship in 2020
 
01:53:25.589 --> 01:53:25.599 align:start position:0%
now whether this bill actually needs to
 
01:53:27.589 --> 01:53:27.599 align:start position:0%
be uh enacted because we're going to try
 
01:53:31.390 --> 01:53:31.400 align:start position:0%
to uh update an old statute that is your
 
01:53:33.870 --> 01:53:33.880 align:start position:0%
decision that is your
 
01:53:36.709 --> 01:53:36.719 align:start position:0%
purview but if it's in the spirit of
 
01:53:39.510 --> 01:53:39.520 align:start position:0%
trying to instigate more partisanship
 
01:53:41.430 --> 01:53:41.440 align:start position:0%
and elections and I would say vote no on
 
01:53:41.440 --> 01:53:42.310 align:start position:0%
and elections and I would say vote no on
this

01:53:42.310 --> 01:53:42.320 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:53:45.270 --> 01:53:45.280 align:start position:0%
please okay will you be taking apologize
 
01:53:46.669 --> 01:53:46.679 align:start position:0%
will you be taking questions represented
 
01:53:50.990 --> 01:53:51.000 align:start position:0%
BL um sure all right that was long pause
 
01:53:53.189 --> 01:53:53.199 align:start position:0%
I expect it other questions
 
01:53:55.189 --> 01:53:55.199 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you I don't have any
 
01:53:58.189 --> 01:53:58.199 align:start position:0%

02:00:29.189 --> 02:00:29.199 align:start position:0%
481 relative to moving the state primary
 
02:00:30.669 --> 02:00:30.679 align:start position:0%
date and going to recognize
 
02:00:32.750 --> 02:00:32.760 align:start position:0%
representative Schultz for the purpose
 
02:00:34.109 --> 02:00:34.119 align:start position:0%
of introduction representative Schultz
 
02:00:36.750 --> 02:00:36.760 align:start position:0%
welcome to election law thank you Mr
 
02:00:38.750 --> 02:00:38.760 align:start position:0%
chair it's really great to be here to
 
02:00:41.229 --> 02:00:41.239 align:start position:0%
talk with you all about this bill I love
 
02:00:43.030 --> 02:00:43.040 align:start position:0%
that these conversations that I've had
 
02:00:45.069 --> 02:00:45.079 align:start position:0%
with your chair in the recent past have
 
02:00:48.350 --> 02:00:48.360 align:start position:0%
been very positive I thought his speech
 
02:00:50.669 --> 02:00:50.679 align:start position:0%
on the house floor really echoed a lot
 
02:00:52.589 --> 02:00:52.599 align:start position:0%
of the thoughts and feelings I had about
 
02:00:55.229 --> 02:00:55.239 align:start position:0%
the state primary and needing to move it
 
02:00:58.069 --> 02:00:58.079 align:start position:0%
and the and the point that this does
 
02:00:59.790 --> 02:00:59.800 align:start position:0%
this sound really super echoey I don't
 
02:01:02.270 --> 02:01:02.280 align:start position:0%
know if I should move further away all
 
02:01:04.950 --> 02:01:04.960 align:start position:0%
right um but the one uh quote that
 
02:01:04.960 --> 02:01:06.830 align:start position:0%
right um but the one uh quote that
really

02:01:06.830 --> 02:01:06.840 align:start position:0%
really
 
02:01:09.550 --> 02:01:09.560 align:start position:0%
um I just still have stuck in my head in
 
02:01:13.669 --> 02:01:13.679 align:start position:0%
a good way is uh your chairman said the
 
02:01:16.430 --> 02:01:16.440 align:start position:0%
existing primary is an incumbent
 
02:01:18.750 --> 02:01:18.760 align:start position:0%
protection plan
 
02:01:21.229 --> 02:01:21.239 align:start position:0%
essentially um and I couldn't agree more
 
02:01:24.149 --> 02:01:24.159 align:start position:0%
so let me take a step back hi I'm Chris
 
02:01:26.790 --> 02:01:26.800 align:start position:0%
Schultz I'm a State Rep from conquered I
 
02:01:30.430 --> 02:01:30.440 align:start position:0%
represent Wards four nine and 10 Ward
 
02:01:32.510 --> 02:01:32.520 align:start position:0%
four is where we're sitting right now so
 
02:01:35.470 --> 02:01:35.480 align:start position:0%
welcome to my district um I first
 
02:01:37.229 --> 02:01:37.239 align:start position:0%
arrived to New Hampshire because I
 
02:01:39.189 --> 02:01:39.199 align:start position:0%
managed a Governor's race for Mark
 
02:01:41.430 --> 02:01:41.440 align:start position:0%
fernel the second one not against jeene
 
02:01:43.830 --> 02:01:43.840 align:start position:0%
Shaheen but the one that Craig Benson
 
02:01:46.350 --> 02:01:46.360 align:start position:0%
ended up winning so if you loved Craig
 
02:01:47.589 --> 02:01:47.599 align:start position:0%
Benson you're
 
02:01:50.750 --> 02:01:50.760 align:start position:0%
welcome but we did have a tough primary
 
02:01:52.390 --> 02:01:52.400 align:start position:0%
um I though
 
02:01:54.550 --> 02:01:54.560 align:start position:0%
H come with the experience of having cut
 
02:01:58.229 --> 02:01:58.239 align:start position:0%
my teeth in nine other states um and
 
02:02:00.669 --> 02:02:00.679 align:start position:0%
worked on campaigns and elections and
 
02:02:03.350 --> 02:02:03.360 align:start position:0%
then capitol hill to to a degree still
 
02:02:07.390 --> 02:02:07.400 align:start position:0%
doing that work um for 16 years uh most
 
02:02:09.430 --> 02:02:09.440 align:start position:0%
of it not in New Hampshire I worked in
 
02:02:11.790 --> 02:02:11.800 align:start position:0%
my native state of Kentucky they have a
 
02:02:14.510 --> 02:02:14.520 align:start position:0%
May primary I will say because I grew up
 
02:02:17.510 --> 02:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
in that I have a partiality to that date
 
02:02:19.510 --> 02:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
it's sort of you know the last thing we
 
02:02:22.069 --> 02:02:22.079 align:start position:0%
do before summer kicks off but when I
 
02:02:24.669 --> 02:02:24.679 align:start position:0%
was growing up there I also worked in
 
02:02:27.870 --> 02:02:27.880 align:start position:0%
primaries in Nevada Iowa Wisconsin New
 
02:02:27.880 --> 02:02:29.030 align:start position:0%
primaries in Nevada Iowa Wisconsin New
Jersey

02:02:29.030 --> 02:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
Jersey
 
02:02:33.830 --> 02:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
Virginia South Carolina Washington DC
 
02:02:35.990 --> 02:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania and I'm forgetting another
 
02:02:39.510 --> 02:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
state and New Hampshire so uh that was a
 
02:02:42.189 --> 02:02:42.199 align:start position:0%
wonderful experience to work uh for
 
02:02:44.830 --> 02:02:44.840 align:start position:0%
presidential campaigns I managed a
 
02:02:47.189 --> 02:02:47.199 align:start position:0%
congressional race and a Governor's race
 
02:02:48.629 --> 02:02:48.639 align:start position:0%
I was executive director of the New
 
02:02:51.310 --> 02:02:51.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Democratic party um I worked
 
02:02:54.470 --> 02:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
for Al Gore Bill Clinton uh a labor
 
02:02:56.669 --> 02:02:56.679 align:start position:0%
union program for Barack Obama I worked
 
02:02:59.430 --> 02:02:59.440 align:start position:0%
for John KY so anyway there's a very
 
02:03:01.750 --> 02:03:01.760 align:start position:0%
very quick version of my resume I only
 
02:03:03.350 --> 02:03:03.360 align:start position:0%
say that to say I come with the
 
02:03:06.229 --> 02:03:06.239 align:start position:0%
experience of having seen firsthand the
 
02:03:09.229 --> 02:03:09.239 align:start position:0%
impact of when the primary date is and
 
02:03:12.030 --> 02:03:12.040 align:start position:0%
how that impacts the general election
 
02:03:14.069 --> 02:03:14.079 align:start position:0%
and I think the part that's nonpartisan
 
02:03:16.270 --> 02:03:16.280 align:start position:0%
here and I would love it I was almost
 
02:03:17.709 --> 02:03:17.719 align:start position:0%
wish we could have a dialogue with the
 
02:03:19.629 --> 02:03:19.639 align:start position:0%
chair because I know he agrees with some
 
02:03:21.990 --> 02:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
of these points and some not probably
 
02:03:25.470 --> 02:03:25.480 align:start position:0%
but um I feel strongly having first from
 
02:03:27.350 --> 02:03:27.360 align:start position:0%
my experience with that governor's race
 
02:03:29.870 --> 02:03:29.880 align:start position:0%
and then how it has continued on in the
 
02:03:32.069 --> 02:03:32.079 align:start position:0%
Democratic side and it does seem to have
 
02:03:35.830 --> 02:03:35.840 align:start position:0%
been longer on the Republican side that
 
02:03:39.069 --> 02:03:39.079 align:start position:0%
having a 58 day roughly on average
 
02:03:41.430 --> 02:03:41.440 align:start position:0%
general election really isn't enough to
 
02:03:44.189 --> 02:03:44.199 align:start position:0%
recover from a major uh difficult
 
02:03:46.990 --> 02:03:47.000 align:start position:0%
primary you know I'll just put it out
 
02:03:48.790 --> 02:03:48.800 align:start position:0%
there maybe I should save it for a a
 
02:03:51.149 --> 02:03:51.159 align:start position:0%
democratic caucus to talk about this but
 
02:03:53.990 --> 02:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
we need trans transparency in this issue
 
02:03:56.270 --> 02:03:56.280 align:start position:0%
um on the Democratic side it was a rough
 
02:03:59.430 --> 02:03:59.440 align:start position:0%
transition for Mark fold to go from uh
 
02:04:01.910 --> 02:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
that primary to facing someone who was
 
02:04:03.950 --> 02:04:03.960 align:start position:0%
spending millions of dollars on Boston
 
02:04:06.350 --> 02:04:06.360 align:start position:0%
TV you know and talked about an income
 
02:04:09.149 --> 02:04:09.159 align:start position:0%
tax that was impossible but you know
 
02:04:11.750 --> 02:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
regardless of what his message was to to
 
02:04:16.390 --> 02:04:16.400 align:start position:0%
rebuild that connection and recover from
 
02:04:18.950 --> 02:04:18.960 align:start position:0%
and earn the trust from uh Bev huling
 
02:04:20.750 --> 02:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
wor supporters we didn't have the time
 
02:04:22.149 --> 02:04:22.159 align:start position:0%
to do that and communic Comm unicate
 
02:04:24.430 --> 02:04:24.440 align:start position:0%
with your general election voters we
 
02:04:25.990 --> 02:04:26.000 align:start position:0%
also can look to other Democratic
 
02:04:28.270 --> 02:04:28.280 align:start position:0%
primaries on the Democratic side the
 
02:04:31.629 --> 02:04:31.639 align:start position:0%
Andrew valinsky uh Dan felus primary was
 
02:04:34.350 --> 02:04:34.360 align:start position:0%
brutal and I love both those guys but
 
02:04:37.390 --> 02:04:37.400 align:start position:0%
they never you know it never recovered
 
02:04:38.910 --> 02:04:38.920 align:start position:0%
the campaign staff certainly never
 
02:04:41.629 --> 02:04:41.639 align:start position:0%
recovered there still are some some bad
 
02:04:44.069 --> 02:04:44.079 align:start position:0%
blood among folks who worked on those
 
02:04:46.629 --> 02:04:46.639 align:start position:0%
campaigns you know I will say our last
 
02:04:49.149 --> 02:04:49.159 align:start position:0%
gubernatorial primary was brutal and I
 
02:04:50.470 --> 02:04:50.480 align:start position:0%
can see what has happened on the
 
02:04:52.709 --> 02:04:52.719 align:start position:0%
Republican side it hasn't exactly been
 
02:04:55.870 --> 02:04:55.880 align:start position:0%
uh you know puppies and rainbows there
 
02:04:59.870 --> 02:04:59.880 align:start position:0%
either and I just say on that campaign
 
02:05:01.790 --> 02:05:01.800 align:start position:0%
you know it's sort of Just Party
 
02:05:04.109 --> 02:05:04.119 align:start position:0%
politics on this level you know it's
 
02:05:07.390 --> 02:05:07.400 align:start position:0%
hard to Pivot when campaigns are all
 
02:05:10.390 --> 02:05:10.400 align:start position:0%
about pivoting pivoting from your
 
02:05:12.950 --> 02:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
primary message and who you're speaking
 
02:05:15.030 --> 02:05:15.040 align:start position:0%
to and who your message is directed at
 
02:05:16.629 --> 02:05:16.639 align:start position:0%
and you know these things are very much
 
02:05:18.709 --> 02:05:18.719 align:start position:0%
drilled down on who's going to be the
 
02:05:20.990 --> 02:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
deciding factor to a much different
 
02:05:24.030 --> 02:05:24.040 align:start position:0%
audience general which is now I'll say
 
02:05:25.990 --> 02:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
here's the part that affects the average
 
02:05:28.790 --> 02:05:28.800 align:start position:0%
Granite stator and why we should move it
 
02:05:32.589 --> 02:05:32.599 align:start position:0%
to only hear from your general election
 
02:05:34.669 --> 02:05:34.679 align:start position:0%
candidates and their general election
 
02:05:39.510 --> 02:05:39.520 align:start position:0%
message for 58 days it really does give
 
02:05:42.149 --> 02:05:42.159 align:start position:0%
an added bonus as the chair said on the
 
02:05:45.109 --> 02:05:45.119 align:start position:0%
house floor last year to the incumbent
 
02:05:47.270 --> 02:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
in a way that doesn't favor
 
02:05:50.229 --> 02:05:50.239 align:start position:0%
democracy uh you know I love our our
 
02:05:52.030 --> 02:05:52.040 align:start position:0%
federal delegation but they're not
 
02:05:53.629 --> 02:05:53.639 align:start position:0%
always going to be our federal
 
02:05:55.629 --> 02:05:55.639 align:start position:0%
delegation as a Democrat I would love to
 
02:05:57.270 --> 02:05:57.280 align:start position:0%
have a Democratic governor at some point
 
02:06:00.350 --> 02:06:00.360 align:start position:0%
while I'm a State Rep but for grat they
 
02:06:03.470 --> 02:06:03.480 align:start position:0%
need more than 58 days to have that
 
02:06:05.430 --> 02:06:05.440 align:start position:0%
conversation you know it's a whole other
 
02:06:08.510 --> 02:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
slew of people who don't care about I
 
02:06:10.030 --> 02:06:10.040 align:start position:0%
mean we're notorious for this even
 
02:06:11.470 --> 02:06:11.480 align:start position:0%
though Independents can pick either
 
02:06:13.750 --> 02:06:13.760 align:start position:0%
ballot and a primary there's still a
 
02:06:16.510 --> 02:06:16.520 align:start position:0%
bunch that don't want to do that they
 
02:06:18.310 --> 02:06:18.320 align:start position:0%
don't want to align themselves so much
 
02:06:19.950 --> 02:06:19.960 align:start position:0%
that they don't want to participate in a
 
02:06:22.149 --> 02:06:22.159 align:start position:0%
primary as a voter
 
02:06:24.549 --> 02:06:24.559 align:start position:0%
and they're eager to see what fleshes
 
02:06:26.870 --> 02:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
out for the general election ballot and
 
02:06:29.669 --> 02:06:29.679 align:start position:0%
I just feel very strongly um that it
 
02:06:32.430 --> 02:06:32.440 align:start position:0%
would be better for everybody to move
 
02:06:35.310 --> 02:06:35.320 align:start position:0%
that primary to I loved this this was
 
02:06:37.390 --> 02:06:37.400 align:start position:0%
essentially the Senate bill from a year
 
02:06:41.629 --> 02:06:41.639 align:start position:0%
ago um that the senate had passed after
 
02:06:43.270 --> 02:06:43.280 align:start position:0%
editing and it went back and forth this
 
02:06:46.390 --> 02:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
was the final version sent to the house
 
02:06:49.149 --> 02:06:49.159 align:start position:0%
um in late May of last year and I
 
02:06:51.750 --> 02:06:51.760 align:start position:0%
thought that that June date was a great
 
02:06:55.030 --> 02:06:55.040 align:start position:0%
date um I think there are other ways we
 
02:06:57.149 --> 02:06:57.159 align:start position:0%
could because I think that's you know if
 
02:06:58.669 --> 02:06:58.679 align:start position:0%
you're just voting on one bill with a
 
02:07:01.149 --> 02:07:01.159 align:start position:0%
date that's difficult you know if like
 
02:07:03.149 --> 02:07:03.159 align:start position:0%
well I'd prefer August or well I'd
 
02:07:06.310 --> 02:07:06.320 align:start position:0%
prefer July I don't know um I'd prefer
 
02:07:08.350 --> 02:07:08.360 align:start position:0%
before Labor day but just before Labor
 
02:07:10.229 --> 02:07:10.239 align:start position:0%
Day you know there's many there are a
 
02:07:11.990 --> 02:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
lot of strong feelings for all of us of
 
02:07:15.870 --> 02:07:15.880 align:start position:0%
when it should be I'd suggested that we
 
02:07:18.669 --> 02:07:18.679 align:start position:0%
informally with the House and Senate
 
02:07:19.990 --> 02:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
knowing that Democrats are in the
 
02:07:22.189 --> 02:07:22.199 align:start position:0%
minority is fine we did a sort of rank
 
02:07:24.270 --> 02:07:24.280 align:start position:0%
Choice voting of the top
 
02:07:27.109 --> 02:07:27.119 align:start position:0%
10 possible that you guys could come up
 
02:07:29.950 --> 02:07:29.960 align:start position:0%
with possible choices and do a rank
 
02:07:31.830 --> 02:07:31.840 align:start position:0%
Choice voting of that and see which one
 
02:07:34.109 --> 02:07:34.119 align:start position:0%
is the first or second or whatever I
 
02:07:35.589 --> 02:07:35.599 align:start position:0%
realize the governor is going to play
 
02:07:37.549 --> 02:07:37.559 align:start position:0%
heavily in this conversation I don't
 
02:07:39.870 --> 02:07:39.880 align:start position:0%
know to what degree Democrats will be a
 
02:07:41.950 --> 02:07:41.960 align:start position:0%
part of that conversation but I think
 
02:07:43.830 --> 02:07:43.840 align:start position:0%
coming to the point of not just looking
 
02:07:46.229 --> 02:07:46.239 align:start position:0%
at one day or the other we need a
 
02:07:48.629 --> 02:07:48.639 align:start position:0%
process that we can work together on
 
02:07:50.709 --> 02:07:50.719 align:start position:0%
that isn't just All or Nothing on one
 
02:07:53.229 --> 02:07:53.239 align:start position:0%
date and that's my suggestion to this
 
02:07:56.470 --> 02:07:56.480 align:start position:0%
committee I'd be happy to um do all the
 
02:07:59.229 --> 02:07:59.239 align:start position:0%
leg I'm not some big rank Choice voting
 
02:08:01.990 --> 02:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
Advocate per se but I certainly can get
 
02:08:04.750 --> 02:08:04.760 align:start position:0%
access to the the software I believe we
 
02:08:06.790 --> 02:08:06.800 align:start position:0%
could get it for free we could do it in
 
02:08:09.310 --> 02:08:09.320 align:start position:0%
an informal way it doesn't have to be a
 
02:08:12.109 --> 02:08:12.119 align:start position:0%
part of a bill it could be you know like
 
02:08:15.109 --> 02:08:15.119 align:start position:0%
a work session for the whole legislature
 
02:08:17.030 --> 02:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
include the Senate that's just my
 
02:08:19.870 --> 02:08:19.880 align:start position:0%
suggestion but if we don't do something
 
02:08:22.430 --> 02:08:22.440 align:start position:0%
like that and this bill is being
 
02:08:24.589 --> 02:08:24.599 align:start position:0%
considered I do think that this is the
 
02:08:27.270 --> 02:08:27.280 align:start position:0%
best time for us to have it it gives us
 
02:08:31.270 --> 02:08:31.280 align:start position:0%
a couple more months to Pivot and to um
 
02:08:32.669 --> 02:08:32.679 align:start position:0%
rebuild those
 
02:08:35.589 --> 02:08:35.599 align:start position:0%
relationships really for the the part of
 
02:08:37.790 --> 02:08:37.800 align:start position:0%
the ticket that it impacts the most I
 
02:08:39.430 --> 02:08:39.440 align:start position:0%
don't I don't I feel like we as state
 
02:08:40.910 --> 02:08:40.920 align:start position:0%
reps will adapt to whatever it's going
 
02:08:43.830 --> 02:08:43.840 align:start position:0%
to be we are a scrappy uh devoted group
 
02:08:46.030 --> 02:08:46.040 align:start position:0%
of people who really know our voters I
 
02:08:48.750 --> 02:08:48.760 align:start position:0%
feel like we will pivot even if it's you
 
02:08:51.470 --> 02:08:51.480 align:start position:0%
know we move the deadline for filing
 
02:08:53.350 --> 02:08:53.360 align:start position:0%
earlier I feel like the part of the
 
02:08:55.870 --> 02:08:55.880 align:start position:0%
ballot that is going to impact this in
 
02:08:58.790 --> 02:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
the good way the most are the races for
 
02:09:02.669 --> 02:09:02.679 align:start position:0%
governor US Senate Congress probably
 
02:09:04.390 --> 02:09:04.400 align:start position:0%
executive counselor to some degree and
 
02:09:08.270 --> 02:09:08.280 align:start position:0%
in some State Senate races um I also
 
02:09:11.030 --> 02:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
will send to you I did research the
 
02:09:14.030 --> 02:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
filing deadline of all the states in
 
02:09:17.030 --> 02:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
America and when they filing deadline is
 
02:09:20.189 --> 02:09:20.199 align:start position:0%
and ours is among the latest but some I
 
02:09:22.750 --> 02:09:22.760 align:start position:0%
think let me
 
02:09:25.950 --> 02:09:25.960 align:start position:0%
uh seven states have their filing
 
02:09:28.350 --> 02:09:28.360 align:start position:0%
deadline in the year before the election
 
02:09:31.350 --> 02:09:31.360 align:start position:0%
year so if you're running in
 
02:09:36.589 --> 02:09:36.599 align:start position:0%
2026 in those seven states you file in
 
02:09:39.149 --> 02:09:39.159 align:start position:0%
the end of this year so and then it
 
02:09:41.470 --> 02:09:41.480 align:start position:0%
varies four file in January four
 
02:09:45.549 --> 02:09:45.559 align:start position:0%
February 12 in March 9 in April 3 in May
 
02:09:48.270 --> 02:09:48.280 align:start position:0%
s in June and only three states have a
 
02:09:50.910 --> 02:09:50.920 align:start position:0%
filing de deadline that is later than
 
02:09:52.669 --> 02:09:52.679 align:start position:0%
ours that may have changed since the
 
02:09:55.510 --> 02:09:55.520 align:start position:0%
last um legislative cycle I will double
 
02:09:57.430 --> 02:09:57.440 align:start position:0%
check that before I forward this to you
 
02:10:00.669 --> 02:10:00.679 align:start position:0%
but um and I know that those States also
 
02:10:03.310 --> 02:10:03.320 align:start position:0%
were looking at moving their primaries I
 
02:10:05.069 --> 02:10:05.079 align:start position:0%
think Rhode Island is one that is
 
02:10:07.870 --> 02:10:07.880 align:start position:0%
already doing that so literally almost
 
02:10:09.669 --> 02:10:09.679 align:start position:0%
the entire rest of the country has an
 
02:10:12.030 --> 02:10:12.040 align:start position:0%
earlier F filing deadline and an earlier
 
02:10:14.069 --> 02:10:14.079 align:start position:0%
primary than we do there used to be
 
02:10:16.229 --> 02:10:16.239 align:start position:0%
quite a few mainly in New England that
 
02:10:19.589 --> 02:10:19.599 align:start position:0%
had a September primary and I think in
 
02:10:21.910 --> 02:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
the near future will be one of if not
 
02:10:25.549 --> 02:10:25.559 align:start position:0%
the last in um Delaware and Louisiana
 
02:10:26.950 --> 02:10:26.960 align:start position:0%
and rhod Island those are the three
 
02:10:28.950 --> 02:10:28.960 align:start position:0%
states who had later than us and it
 
02:10:31.350 --> 02:10:31.360 align:start position:0%
looks like they've been working to move
 
02:10:32.229 --> 02:10:32.239 align:start position:0%
it as
 
02:10:35.189 --> 02:10:35.199 align:start position:0%
well so anyway I mean there's a lot of
 
02:10:36.870 --> 02:10:36.880 align:start position:0%
other things I could say about this I
 
02:10:38.950 --> 02:10:38.960 align:start position:0%
will forward that about the filing
 
02:10:41.069 --> 02:10:41.079 align:start position:0%
deadline I think that was the one of the
 
02:10:43.069 --> 02:10:43.079 align:start position:0%
biggest difficulties that the Democratic
 
02:10:45.790 --> 02:10:45.800 align:start position:0%
house Democratic caucus had at the time
 
02:10:48.870 --> 02:10:48.880 align:start position:0%
a year ago was concerns over when the
 
02:10:52.669 --> 02:10:52.679 align:start position:0%
filing deadline will be and you know I
 
02:10:54.669 --> 02:10:54.679 align:start position:0%
still I'll reiterate I feel that we as
 
02:10:58.189 --> 02:10:58.199 align:start position:0%
state reps can adapt to whenever it will
 
02:11:01.189 --> 02:11:01.199 align:start position:0%
be and yeah change can be painful but I
 
02:11:03.549 --> 02:11:03.559 align:start position:0%
think knowing that it's really important
 
02:11:05.350 --> 02:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
to the top of the ticket and all of
 
02:11:08.950 --> 02:11:08.960 align:start position:0%
those above us I feel strongly that we
 
02:11:11.790 --> 02:11:11.800 align:start position:0%
need to make this change and you know
 
02:11:14.310 --> 02:11:14.320 align:start position:0%
within a year or less even we'll find
 
02:11:16.950 --> 02:11:16.960 align:start position:0%
that that adapting to that schedule for
 
02:11:19.069 --> 02:11:19.079 align:start position:0%
State reps is fine it just means we keep
 
02:11:22.390 --> 02:11:22.400 align:start position:0%
talking to our voters our constituency
 
02:11:24.149 --> 02:11:24.159 align:start position:0%
you know are you not going to talk to
 
02:11:26.310 --> 02:11:26.320 align:start position:0%
your constituency during a session you
 
02:11:28.549 --> 02:11:28.559 align:start position:0%
should be I should be we all should be
 
02:11:30.910 --> 02:11:30.920 align:start position:0%
you know I hope you don't wait till June
 
02:11:33.350 --> 02:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
to start talking to your constituents
 
02:11:35.629 --> 02:11:35.639 align:start position:0%
but um I don't mean that in a judgy way
 
02:11:38.430 --> 02:11:38.440 align:start position:0%
I'm just saying we can we will adapt as
 
02:11:41.030 --> 02:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
state reps we're Scrappy we can do it
 
02:11:42.870 --> 02:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
but we need to not think about ourselves
 
02:11:44.589 --> 02:11:44.599 align:start position:0%
in that way we need to think about the
 
02:11:47.830 --> 02:11:47.840 align:start position:0%
top of the ticket um I just realized are
 
02:11:49.549 --> 02:11:49.559 align:start position:0%
you a co-sponsor of this bill that's why
 
02:11:50.910 --> 02:11:50.920 align:start position:0%
you're sitting up darn I wish we could
 
02:11:52.030 --> 02:11:52.040 align:start position:0%
have a real
 
02:11:55.229 --> 02:11:55.239 align:start position:0%
conversation um anyway again I realize
 
02:11:56.910 --> 02:11:56.920 align:start position:0%
Republicans are going to weigh much
 
02:11:58.870 --> 02:11:58.880 align:start position:0%
heavier than we Democrats are but I'm
 
02:12:01.270 --> 02:12:01.280 align:start position:0%
going to do my part to work with the
 
02:12:05.350 --> 02:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
Democratic house caucus to see if we can
 
02:12:07.990 --> 02:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
GA gather better support for this and
 
02:12:11.270 --> 02:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
moving this um I know that there are
 
02:12:14.030 --> 02:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
folks who've worked on campaigns in you
 
02:12:16.470 --> 02:12:16.480 align:start position:0%
know the recent years Al those staff
 
02:12:18.990 --> 02:12:19.000 align:start position:0%
would definitely as far as I could tell
 
02:12:21.430 --> 02:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
would like to have an earlier primary
 
02:12:23.790 --> 02:12:23.800 align:start position:0%
for the most part and um I would be
 
02:12:25.870 --> 02:12:25.880 align:start position:0%
happy to do more work in Outreach with
 
02:12:28.109 --> 02:12:28.119 align:start position:0%
the Democrats but having said all that
 
02:12:30.629 --> 02:12:30.639 align:start position:0%
um I'll answer any questions you may
 
02:12:32.910 --> 02:12:32.920 align:start position:0%
have well thank you for your testimony
 
02:12:35.189 --> 02:12:35.199 align:start position:0%
do we have any questions from the
 
02:12:37.830 --> 02:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
committee representative wood thank you
 
02:12:39.709 --> 02:12:39.719 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you representative
 
02:12:42.229 --> 02:12:42.239 align:start position:0%
for uh sharing your experiences and your
 
02:12:45.830 --> 02:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
thoughts on this um I believe you uh you
 
02:12:47.030 --> 02:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
answered this but I want to make sure I
 
02:12:48.790 --> 02:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
was clear because you did a pretty good
 
02:12:51.470 --> 02:12:51.480 align:start position:0%
job talking about the difficulty and
 
02:12:54.229 --> 02:12:54.239 align:start position:0%
picking the day the month whatever I
 
02:12:56.470 --> 02:12:56.480 align:start position:0%
believe you said that you were in favor
 
02:12:57.910 --> 02:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
of the
 
02:13:01.430 --> 02:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
June okay so that's true can I follow
 
02:13:05.069 --> 02:13:05.079 align:start position:0%
up yes so I just want why are you in
 
02:13:07.629 --> 02:13:07.639 align:start position:0%
favor of the June well I think the
 
02:13:09.510 --> 02:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
earliest we could have it the better
 
02:13:10.990 --> 02:13:11.000 align:start position:0%
based on all those states that I've
 
02:13:15.030 --> 02:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
worked in um you know
 
02:13:16.830 --> 02:13:16.840 align:start position:0%
traditionally I think of Summer
 
02:13:18.910 --> 02:13:18.920 align:start position:0%
beginning here around Memorial day but
 
02:13:21.629 --> 02:13:21.639 align:start position:0%
for practical purposes kids are usually
 
02:13:25.109 --> 02:13:25.119 align:start position:0%
in school till mid June to do it before
 
02:13:27.149 --> 02:13:27.159 align:start position:0%
family vacations start kicking off would
 
02:13:30.709 --> 02:13:30.719 align:start position:0%
be good and I think um that would give
 
02:13:34.069 --> 02:13:34.079 align:start position:0%
us a good compromise between what I feel
 
02:13:35.709 --> 02:13:35.719 align:start position:0%
would even be better dates which would
 
02:13:38.350 --> 02:13:38.360 align:start position:0%
be earlier than the date in the bill and
 
02:13:40.750 --> 02:13:40.760 align:start position:0%
those that would prefer a July or August
 
02:13:42.430 --> 02:13:42.440 align:start position:0%
I feel like that is literally the
 
02:13:45.310 --> 02:13:45.320 align:start position:0%
midpoint of when what could be
 
02:13:45.320 --> 02:13:47.350 align:start position:0%
midpoint of when what could be
best

02:13:47.350 --> 02:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
best
 
02:13:50.350 --> 02:13:50.360 align:start position:0%
um yeah I think that that just juggles
 
02:13:53.430 --> 02:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
the whole idea have family vacations and
 
02:13:55.990 --> 02:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
when folks start summering both as a
 
02:13:58.189 --> 02:13:58.199 align:start position:0%
noun and a verb in New Hampshire it
 
02:14:00.950 --> 02:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
gives folks the time to have some
 
02:14:05.270 --> 02:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
vacation as voters you know and then um
 
02:14:06.709 --> 02:14:06.719 align:start position:0%
we already know who our candidates are
 
02:14:08.069 --> 02:14:08.079 align:start position:0%
for the general election and that
 
02:14:10.030 --> 02:14:10.040 align:start position:0%
messaging can start I feel like that is
 
02:14:14.069 --> 02:14:14.079 align:start position:0%
a good compromised date but you
 
02:14:16.470 --> 02:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
know I'm tempted to say what date do you
 
02:14:18.669 --> 02:14:18.679 align:start position:0%
think would be good
 
02:14:21.750 --> 02:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
but thank you thank you
 
02:14:23.430 --> 02:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
do we have any further questions from
 
02:14:28.069 --> 02:14:28.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:30.310 --> 02:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
witness seeing n thank you very much
 
02:14:31.709 --> 02:14:31.719 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and I really
 
02:14:33.629 --> 02:14:33.639 align:start position:0%
appreciate your time on this and hope we
 
02:14:36.069 --> 02:14:36.079 align:start position:0%
can keep talking about it till we can
 
02:14:37.229 --> 02:14:37.239 align:start position:0%
find the most
 
02:14:40.069 --> 02:14:40.079 align:start position:0%
amenable date and eager to see what our
 
02:14:42.549 --> 02:14:42.559 align:start position:0%
governor feels about this as well thank
 
02:14:46.589 --> 02:14:46.599 align:start position:0%
you you're welcome uh next uh I'll
 
02:14:49.109 --> 02:14:49.119 align:start position:0%
recognize chairman Barry who will be
 
02:14:51.709 --> 02:14:51.719 align:start position:0%
filling out a pink card yes we'll f p
 
02:14:53.830 --> 02:14:53.840 align:start position:0%
card I won't um belabor many of the
 
02:14:55.069 --> 02:14:55.079 align:start position:0%
points I just want to point this is a
 
02:14:56.229 --> 02:14:56.239 align:start position:0%
bipartisan bill so I want to thank
 
02:14:58.149 --> 02:14:58.159 align:start position:0%
representative Schultz for approaching
 
02:15:02.109 --> 02:15:02.119 align:start position:0%
me to sponsor it um June would put us
 
02:15:04.910 --> 02:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
basically in the middle of all these
 
02:15:07.470 --> 02:15:07.480 align:start position:0%
states so right now we're last or dead
 
02:15:08.669 --> 02:15:08.679 align:start position:0%
last depending on how you want to look
 
02:15:10.430 --> 02:15:10.440 align:start position:0%
at it uh Louisiana just changed the way
 
02:15:12.390 --> 02:15:12.400 align:start position:0%
it does its primary system but they've
 
02:15:13.430 --> 02:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
historically used what was called a
 
02:15:16.950 --> 02:15:16.960 align:start position:0%
jungle primary so their election day was
 
02:15:18.549 --> 02:15:18.559 align:start position:0%
technically their primary but if you had
 
02:15:20.510 --> 02:15:20.520 align:start position:0%
50 plus one then they didn't have a
 
02:15:22.950 --> 02:15:22.960 align:start position:0%
general election um so I don't know how
 
02:15:24.910 --> 02:15:24.920 align:start position:0%
you want to bracket that in um but June
 
02:15:26.950 --> 02:15:26.960 align:start position:0%
to put us like right in the middle um
 
02:15:29.830 --> 02:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
August appears again to be not an option
 
02:15:31.870 --> 02:15:31.880 align:start position:0%
so um you know the house has the house
 
02:15:33.589 --> 02:15:33.599 align:start position:0%
has voted for June the house has voted
 
02:15:34.870 --> 02:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
for August the house has voted for
 
02:15:37.790 --> 02:15:37.800 align:start position:0%
August again um but it it's June or bust
 
02:15:39.790 --> 02:15:39.800 align:start position:0%
again and I don't say it's my way or the
 
02:15:41.189 --> 02:15:41.199 align:start position:0%
highway because once again I will point
 
02:15:42.870 --> 02:15:42.880 align:start position:0%
out I have voted for June I have voted
 
02:15:44.390 --> 02:15:44.400 align:start position:0%
for August I don't care I just want to
 
02:15:47.109 --> 02:15:47.119 align:start position:0%
move it um I just don't want it to be in
 
02:15:50.510 --> 02:15:50.520 align:start position:0%
September so you know the the the 45 day
 
02:15:50.520 --> 02:15:51.669 align:start position:0%
September so you know the the the 45 day
window

02:15:51.669 --> 02:15:51.679 align:start position:0%
window
 
02:15:53.069 --> 02:15:53.079 align:start position:0%
that basically our current primary
 
02:15:54.870 --> 02:15:54.880 align:start position:0%
crates is a massive incumbent protection
 
02:15:58.229 --> 02:15:58.239 align:start position:0%
plan um it's it's I I kind of warned
 
02:15:59.589 --> 02:15:59.599 align:start position:0%
actually this body when I was trying to
 
02:16:02.350 --> 02:16:02.360 align:start position:0%
do june a year or two ago I said one of
 
02:16:03.709 --> 02:16:03.719 align:start position:0%
these days you're going to have a
 
02:16:05.350 --> 02:16:05.360 align:start position:0%
situation where in an Open Primary
 
02:16:06.510 --> 02:16:06.520 align:start position:0%
you're going to have one party starts
 
02:16:08.470 --> 02:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
running their their one of their can
 
02:16:10.149 --> 02:16:10.159 align:start position:0%
starts running away and then you guys
 
02:16:11.990 --> 02:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
are going to get caught in a contested
 
02:16:12.950 --> 02:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
primary and you're going to lose
 
02:16:14.790 --> 02:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
something like the corner office and
 
02:16:17.549 --> 02:16:17.559 align:start position:0%
then boom that's exactly what happened
 
02:16:19.750 --> 02:16:19.760 align:start position:0%
um the Democrats got caught up in a um
 
02:16:22.149 --> 02:16:22.159 align:start position:0%
Cindy Craig uh Joyce Craig bit her
 
02:16:24.830 --> 02:16:24.840 align:start position:0%
primary uh govern now Governor aot kind
 
02:16:26.629 --> 02:16:26.639 align:start position:0%
of ran away with her primary she was
 
02:16:29.229 --> 02:16:29.239 align:start position:0%
able to Pivot off um and go straight to
 
02:16:31.149 --> 02:16:31.159 align:start position:0%
the general election while the Democrats
 
02:16:33.230 --> 02:16:33.240 align:start position:0%
were marred up uh chasing each other to
 
02:16:36.110 --> 02:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
the left and you saw how that worked out
 
02:16:38.950 --> 02:16:38.960 align:start position:0%
so you know it's not this it's not to
 
02:16:40.230 --> 02:16:40.240 align:start position:0%
say that Democrats are evil in this
 
02:16:41.709 --> 02:16:41.719 align:start position:0%
situation the same thing could have
 
02:16:42.990 --> 02:16:43.000 align:start position:0%
happened to Republicans it could have
 
02:16:44.349 --> 02:16:44.359 align:start position:0%
literally been the exact other way
 
02:16:46.709 --> 02:16:46.719 align:start position:0%
around um it was just going to happen
 
02:16:48.990 --> 02:16:49.000 align:start position:0%
and it happened to the other side first
 
02:16:51.549 --> 02:16:51.559 align:start position:0%
so I would really hope that we could
 
02:16:53.990 --> 02:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
consider June again um because it's like
 
02:16:55.669 --> 02:16:55.679 align:start position:0%
one of those deals of like the beatings
 
02:16:57.910 --> 02:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
will continue until morale improves um
 
02:17:00.709 --> 02:17:00.719 align:start position:0%
morale needs to improve on this the the
 
02:17:00.719 --> 02:17:02.509 align:start position:0%
morale needs to improve on this the the
notion

02:17:02.509 --> 02:17:02.519 align:start position:0%
notion
 
02:17:04.990 --> 02:17:05.000 align:start position:0%
that that we're still in session in
 
02:17:07.230 --> 02:17:07.240 align:start position:0%
April is like
 
02:17:08.990 --> 02:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
ridiculous how many of you were
 
02:17:11.629 --> 02:17:11.639 align:start position:0%
primaried in the last one and and very
 
02:17:13.429 --> 02:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
little of them were even successful you
 
02:17:14.750 --> 02:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
know we're always kind of oh we can't we
 
02:17:16.309 --> 02:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
can't do the primary because we're we're
 
02:17:18.349 --> 02:17:18.359 align:start position:0%
in session we can walk and Sh gum at the
 
02:17:20.309 --> 02:17:20.319 align:start position:0%
same time um I think this Committee of
 
02:17:22.230 --> 02:17:22.240 align:start position:0%
all has how quickly you can move if you
 
02:17:25.509 --> 02:17:25.519 align:start position:0%
want to um and to representative Schultz
 
02:17:27.549 --> 02:17:27.559 align:start position:0%
Point how how dare you assume that
 
02:17:29.270 --> 02:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
you're not talking to your constituents
 
02:17:31.469 --> 02:17:31.479 align:start position:0%
for two years you know it it shouldn't
 
02:17:33.589 --> 02:17:33.599 align:start position:0%
be an issue for an incumbent so I I've
 
02:17:35.349 --> 02:17:35.359 align:start position:0%
been very consistent on that I I hate
 
02:17:36.870 --> 02:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
incumbent protection plans even when it
 
02:17:38.990 --> 02:17:39.000 align:start position:0%
might favor my own party I I find them
 
02:17:42.150 --> 02:17:42.160 align:start position:0%
to be anti-democrat uh small D
 
02:17:44.549 --> 02:17:44.559 align:start position:0%
Democratic um and I think general
 
02:17:46.629 --> 02:17:46.639 align:start position:0%
election voters who are the bulk of the
 
02:17:48.629 --> 02:17:48.639 align:start position:0%
voters they deserve to hear from our
 
02:17:51.150 --> 02:17:51.160 align:start position:0%
candidates both sides uh the idea should
 
02:17:52.469 --> 02:17:52.479 align:start position:0%
play out on their merits not who
 
02:17:53.790 --> 02:17:53.800 align:start position:0%
happened to push through their primary
 
02:17:55.750 --> 02:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
the quickest um and that's exactly what
 
02:17:57.830 --> 02:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
has happened so um I'm happy to take
 
02:17:59.389 --> 02:17:59.399 align:start position:0%
questions but I do have to piece out at
 
02:18:01.509 --> 02:18:01.519 align:start position:0%
11:30 for a meeting so I'm glad I got in
 
02:18:02.709 --> 02:18:02.719 align:start position:0%
there soone F my pink card up but I'm
 
02:18:03.870 --> 02:18:03.880 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions and I don't want
 
02:18:06.429 --> 02:18:06.439 align:start position:0%
to be um repetitive to representative
 
02:18:08.709 --> 02:18:08.719 align:start position:0%
Schultz's excellent excellent
 
02:18:10.629 --> 02:18:10.639 align:start position:0%
remarks yes representative Lane to tell
 
02:18:11.990 --> 02:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
me why I'm oh sorry I'm not chair right
 
02:18:14.110 --> 02:18:14.120 align:start position:0%
now good Lord I'm not chair right now I
 
02:18:16.750 --> 02:18:16.760 align:start position:0%
apologize I'm so used to being chair yes
 
02:18:18.870 --> 02:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
you've made me acting chair yes I am
 
02:18:22.230 --> 02:18:22.240 align:start position:0%
sorry that was so rude that so and the
 
02:18:24.709 --> 02:18:24.719 align:start position:0%
uh witness has told us of his
 
02:18:26.230 --> 02:18:26.240 align:start position:0%
willingness to take questions do we have
 
02:18:27.910 --> 02:18:27.920 align:start position:0%
any questions from the
 
02:18:32.270 --> 02:18:32.280 align:start position:0%
committee representative Lane thank you
 
02:18:35.030 --> 02:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
um now I forgot the question
 
02:18:39.429 --> 02:18:39.439 align:start position:0%
no my recollection is there was concern
 
02:18:42.150 --> 02:18:42.160 align:start position:0%
about the amount of money that might go
 
02:18:46.230 --> 02:18:46.240 align:start position:0%
into the campaigns if we start earlier
 
02:18:48.349 --> 02:18:48.359 align:start position:0%
there's just going to be more money
 
02:18:51.429 --> 02:18:51.439 align:start position:0%
coming in is that of any concern
 
02:18:53.429 --> 02:18:53.439 align:start position:0%
to you at all I I know it was raised
 
02:18:55.270 --> 02:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
last year I just yeah I I don't think
 
02:18:56.589 --> 02:18:56.599 align:start position:0%
that's a concern because the money is
 
02:19:00.389 --> 02:19:00.399 align:start position:0%
going to get there regardless um and
 
02:19:03.150 --> 02:19:03.160 align:start position:0%
it's I I I think that kind of the to
 
02:19:04.910 --> 02:19:04.920 align:start position:0%
Pivot off of your question there I think
 
02:19:06.830 --> 02:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
the bigger question is is when does the
 
02:19:09.070 --> 02:19:09.080 align:start position:0%
Challenger get access to their funds
 
02:19:10.750 --> 02:19:10.760 align:start position:0%
right so you know right now we have the
 
02:19:14.270 --> 02:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
three periods the pre-filing we would
 
02:19:15.790 --> 02:19:15.800 align:start position:0%
call it regular people call exploratory
 
02:19:20.429 --> 02:19:20.439 align:start position:0%
but pre-filing um and then there is um
 
02:19:22.589 --> 02:19:22.599 align:start position:0%
the primary and then there's the general
 
02:19:26.750 --> 02:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
funds right so if you're a if you're a
 
02:19:28.870 --> 02:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
challenger right you're probably going
 
02:19:30.669 --> 02:19:30.679 align:start position:0%
to raise most of your funds for the
 
02:19:32.870 --> 02:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
general because your primary if you're
 
02:19:35.349 --> 02:19:35.359 align:start position:0%
in a contested primary a lot of the the
 
02:19:36.950 --> 02:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
donors are going to back off to see what
 
02:19:39.549 --> 02:19:39.559 align:start position:0%
happens right um so you may not get
 
02:19:41.990 --> 02:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
access to your cash that until the very
 
02:19:44.509 --> 02:19:44.519 align:start position:0%
end well when you get it with 45 days
 
02:19:47.150 --> 02:19:47.160 align:start position:0%
left it's far less effective there's
 
02:19:49.710 --> 02:19:49.720 align:start position:0%
already a lot more you know stuff flying
 
02:19:51.030 --> 02:19:51.040 align:start position:0%
it's harder to break through through at
 
02:19:53.790 --> 02:19:53.800 align:start position:0%
that point um earlier cash in terms of
 
02:19:55.110 --> 02:19:55.120 align:start position:0%
campaigning effectively is better
 
02:19:56.910 --> 02:19:56.920 align:start position:0%
because there's like when you're
 
02:19:59.750 --> 02:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
campaigning you're in this um you're in
 
02:20:02.309 --> 02:20:02.319 align:start position:0%
this quandry which is the closer you get
 
02:20:04.590 --> 02:20:04.600 align:start position:0%
to the election the more people are
 
02:20:07.389 --> 02:20:07.399 align:start position:0%
paying attention right but the closer
 
02:20:09.309 --> 02:20:09.319 align:start position:0%
you get to election the more everyone
 
02:20:11.630 --> 02:20:11.640 align:start position:0%
else is spending so there's more noise
 
02:20:14.270 --> 02:20:14.280 align:start position:0%
and there's this Sweet Spot somewhere um
 
02:20:16.429 --> 02:20:16.439 align:start position:0%
where there's not a lot of noise and not
 
02:20:19.070 --> 02:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of uh but enough people are paying
 
02:20:21.349 --> 02:20:21.359 align:start position:0%
attention and I definitely don't think
 
02:20:23.110 --> 02:20:23.120 align:start position:0%
we're in that sweet spot now I think
 
02:20:25.230 --> 02:20:25.240 align:start position:0%
we're way too by the time the Challenger
 
02:20:27.110 --> 02:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
gets access to what could offensively be
 
02:20:28.550 --> 02:20:28.560 align:start position:0%
a third of their funds probably actually
 
02:20:31.070 --> 02:20:31.080 align:start position:0%
bring on it's probably closer to half um
 
02:20:34.469 --> 02:20:34.479 align:start position:0%
you know they have 45 days to unload it
 
02:20:36.950 --> 02:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
and I think in the last in the hearing
 
02:20:38.349 --> 02:20:38.359 align:start position:0%
from two years ago somebody raised up
 
02:20:39.670 --> 02:20:39.680 align:start position:0%
like well they can campaign in the
 
02:20:41.349 --> 02:20:41.359 align:start position:0%
general and the primary at the same time
 
02:20:44.030 --> 02:20:44.040 align:start position:0%
I like well no they can't um you know if
 
02:20:45.870 --> 02:20:45.880 align:start position:0%
they have limited funds or they're in a
 
02:20:48.030 --> 02:20:48.040 align:start position:0%
contested primary they have to campaign
 
02:20:49.510 --> 02:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
to the electorate that's going to elect
 
02:20:50.950 --> 02:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
them first which is the primary AR
 
02:20:54.510 --> 02:20:54.520 align:start position:0%
electorate um and you like the easiest
 
02:20:57.030 --> 02:20:57.040 align:start position:0%
example of that is direct mail right so
 
02:20:58.710 --> 02:20:58.720 align:start position:0%
if you're in a contested primary you're
 
02:21:01.630 --> 02:21:01.640 align:start position:0%
only going to send direct mail to the
 
02:21:04.110 --> 02:21:04.120 align:start position:0%
houses that vote in the primary you're
 
02:21:05.070 --> 02:21:05.080 align:start position:0%
only that's the only thing you're going
 
02:21:07.630 --> 02:21:07.640 align:start position:0%
to do because if you don't do that right
 
02:21:09.190 --> 02:21:09.200 align:start position:0%
if you say all right I'm going to do the
 
02:21:10.590 --> 02:21:10.600 align:start position:0%
primary and the general electorate and
 
02:21:11.750 --> 02:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
then that other person beats you in the
 
02:21:14.150 --> 02:21:14.160 align:start position:0%
primary well guess what like so what you
 
02:21:15.950 --> 02:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
campaign to the general elector it
 
02:21:18.150 --> 02:21:18.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter you're not the nominee so
 
02:21:20.270 --> 02:21:20.280 align:start position:0%
it it's the the system is kind of set up
 
02:21:22.389 --> 02:21:22.399 align:start position:0%
with these hurdles in front of it and
 
02:21:24.630 --> 02:21:24.640 align:start position:0%
all I want to do is move that last I
 
02:21:25.870 --> 02:21:25.880 align:start position:0%
guess the second to last hurdle the last
 
02:21:27.670 --> 02:21:27.680 align:start position:0%
hurdle being the the general election
 
02:21:29.750 --> 02:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
but move that second to last hurdle back
 
02:21:32.630 --> 02:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
a little bit to give both sides an
 
02:21:35.030 --> 02:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity um to compete and I I think
 
02:21:37.270 --> 02:21:37.280 align:start position:0%
it'll be better for voters to hear from
 
02:21:39.150 --> 02:21:39.160 align:start position:0%
you know the the vast majority of Voters
 
02:21:40.349 --> 02:21:40.359 align:start position:0%
do not vote in a
 
02:21:42.710 --> 02:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
primary they don't it's like going to be
 
02:21:45.190 --> 02:21:45.200 align:start position:0%
20 25% turnout so like three4 of the
 
02:21:47.630 --> 02:21:47.640 align:start position:0%
voters are not voting in that and to say
 
02:21:49.469 --> 02:21:49.479 align:start position:0%
34s of the voters are only going to get
 
02:21:52.309 --> 02:21:52.319 align:start position:0%
talked to um directly you know they
 
02:21:54.469 --> 02:21:54.479 align:start position:0%
might be able to get you know if they're
 
02:21:55.910 --> 02:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
watching the right TV station or
 
02:21:57.230 --> 02:21:57.240 align:start position:0%
whatever they might be able to get a
 
02:22:00.110 --> 02:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
message um but if to say to kind of just
 
02:22:01.150 --> 02:22:01.160 align:start position:0%
exclude them and say they're only going
 
02:22:04.389 --> 02:22:04.399 align:start position:0%
to get 45 days of talking to um is is
 
02:22:05.790 --> 02:22:05.800 align:start position:0%
kind of ridiculous and also when you
 
02:22:08.630 --> 02:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
bring in the absentee ballots right so
 
02:22:10.150 --> 02:22:10.160 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots are usually around 10
 
02:22:13.270 --> 02:22:13.280 align:start position:0%
to 15% of the election and when you
 
02:22:14.590 --> 02:22:14.600 align:start position:0%
think about when absentee ballots go out
 
02:22:16.070 --> 02:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
like specifically uok Cava right uok
 
02:22:19.429 --> 02:22:19.439 align:start position:0%
Cava ballots go out 45 days on the nose
 
02:22:22.790 --> 02:22:22.800 align:start position:0%
before the election 45 days so if that
 
02:22:25.270 --> 02:22:25.280 align:start position:0%
case that voter is getting that ballot
 
02:22:27.990 --> 02:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
in their hand um they're probably
 
02:22:29.790 --> 02:22:29.800 align:start position:0%
getting that b voting the hand they've
 
02:22:32.910 --> 02:22:32.920 align:start position:0%
maybe had a week and a half maybe maybe
 
02:22:35.309 --> 02:22:35.319 align:start position:0%
two weeks of general election activity
 
02:22:36.990 --> 02:22:37.000 align:start position:0%
um to offensively make their choice so
 
02:22:38.309 --> 02:22:38.319 align:start position:0%
if we're going to be for voters making
 
02:22:40.670 --> 02:22:40.680 align:start position:0%
informed choices we have to allow the
 
02:22:42.510 --> 02:22:42.520 align:start position:0%
candidates to make their pitch and let
 
02:22:43.790 --> 02:22:43.800 align:start position:0%
the voters decide on their merits
 
02:22:45.590 --> 02:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
because if you want to reduce partisan
 
02:22:47.750 --> 02:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
activity the worst thing you can do is
 
02:22:51.230 --> 02:22:51.240 align:start position:0%
not let them inform not let a inform
 
02:22:53.790 --> 02:22:53.800 align:start position:0%
them inform the voters about themselves
 
02:22:55.670 --> 02:22:55.680 align:start position:0%
because now the voters are going to do
 
02:22:57.590 --> 02:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
what they're going to vote on the only
 
02:22:58.710 --> 02:22:58.720 align:start position:0%
piece of information that they have in
 
02:23:00.630 --> 02:23:00.640 align:start position:0%
front of them which happens to be party
 
02:23:02.110 --> 02:23:02.120 align:start position:0%
and they're just going to you know go
 
02:23:03.550 --> 02:23:03.560 align:start position:0%
down one column or the other so if you
 
02:23:05.510 --> 02:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
want to actually kind of state if you
 
02:23:07.150 --> 02:23:07.160 align:start position:0%
want to do what you state you wanted to
 
02:23:09.309 --> 02:23:09.319 align:start position:0%
do which is reduce partisanship increase
 
02:23:11.429 --> 02:23:11.439 align:start position:0%
you know cross ticket balloting you need
 
02:23:14.110 --> 02:23:14.120 align:start position:0%
to let both candidates from both parties
 
02:23:16.110 --> 02:23:16.120 align:start position:0%
have a more equal you'll never get fully
 
02:23:18.710 --> 02:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
equal but a more equal opportunity to
 
02:23:21.630 --> 02:23:21.640 align:start position:0%
make that pitch um and you know let the
 
02:23:24.349 --> 02:23:24.359 align:start position:0%
ideas let their ideas and their Pitch
 
02:23:26.070 --> 02:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
live or die on their merits instead of
 
02:23:27.389 --> 02:23:27.399 align:start position:0%
living or dying on did they have a
 
02:23:27.399 --> 02:23:29.389 align:start position:0%
living or dying on did they have a
contested

02:23:29.389 --> 02:23:29.399 align:start position:0%
contested
 
02:23:31.389 --> 02:23:31.399 align:start position:0%
primary okay thank you do we have
 
02:23:34.030 --> 02:23:34.040 align:start position:0%

408 is uh representative Oregan is here
 
02:25:38.429 --> 02:25:38.439 align:start position:0%
the bill and I have um some written
 
02:25:40.870 --> 02:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
testimony but I'm not sure whether they
 
02:25:42.269 --> 02:25:42.279 align:start position:0%
supposed to pass it around the table if
 
02:25:43.910 --> 02:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
you would place it on the table in front
 
02:25:45.550 --> 02:25:45.560 align:start position:0%
of you please okay everybody will get a
 
02:25:55.550 --> 02:25:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:00.190 --> 02:26:00.200 align:start position:0%
okay representative Morgan yes and and
 
02:26:02.230 --> 02:26:02.240 align:start position:0%
there is a cop version of my written
 
02:26:04.750 --> 02:26:04.760 align:start position:0%
testimony on the online portal but it's
 
02:26:07.389 --> 02:26:07.399 align:start position:0%
actually a slightly I amended it after I
 
02:26:12.030 --> 02:26:12.040 align:start position:0%
put it on the uh on the portal but um so
 
02:26:13.830 --> 02:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
I'm resident Timothy hor straford County
 
02:26:16.150 --> 02:26:16.160 align:start position:0%
District 10 the town of Durham and um
 
02:26:17.309 --> 02:26:17.319 align:start position:0%
even though I have my doubts about the
 
02:26:18.790 --> 02:26:18.800 align:start position:0%
June primary I'm grateful that
 
02:26:20.630 --> 02:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
representative Schultz is the co-p of
 
02:26:23.309 --> 02:26:23.319 align:start position:0%
this one because we were both interested
 
02:26:27.070 --> 02:26:27.080 align:start position:0%
in an earlier primary so this
 
02:26:29.429 --> 02:26:29.439 align:start position:0%
issue of moving the state primary has
 
02:26:31.190 --> 02:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
come for this for the house election law
 
02:26:32.750 --> 02:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
committee many times in the past I
 
02:26:34.670 --> 02:26:34.680 align:start position:0%
myself have sponsored two such bills
 
02:26:36.790 --> 02:26:36.800 align:start position:0%
neither of which went went very far one
 
02:26:38.309 --> 02:26:38.319 align:start position:0%
of them was like virtually identical to
 
02:26:39.870 --> 02:26:39.880 align:start position:0%
this one but I think I had a different
 
02:26:44.630 --> 02:26:44.640 align:start position:0%
Tuesday in August in mind um so what
 
02:26:47.070 --> 02:26:47.080 align:start position:0%
this does at least is introduced it
 
02:26:48.469 --> 02:26:48.479 align:start position:0%
would move the state primary to the
 
02:26:50.389 --> 02:26:50.399 align:start position:0%
fourth Tuesday in August of the even
 
02:26:52.190 --> 02:26:52.200 align:start position:0%
numbered years that means the primary
 
02:26:54.070 --> 02:26:54.080 align:start position:0%
would henceforth be held sometime
 
02:26:57.429 --> 02:26:57.439 align:start position:0%
between August 22nd and August 28th if
 
02:27:00.630 --> 02:27:00.640 align:start position:0%
we passed this uh if we pass this at
 
02:27:02.269 --> 02:27:02.279 align:start position:0%
least if at least if we pass this in
 
02:27:04.590 --> 02:27:04.600 align:start position:0%
2025 this next day primary would take
 
02:27:08.590 --> 02:27:08.600 align:start position:0%
place on August 25th 2026 and the status
 
02:27:10.469 --> 02:27:10.479 align:start position:0%
quo you all know is a second Tuesday in
 
02:27:12.309 --> 02:27:12.319 align:start position:0%
September of even numbered year which is
 
02:27:15.230 --> 02:27:15.240 align:start position:0%
between September 8th and September 14th
 
02:27:17.910 --> 02:27:17.920 align:start position:0%
and actually September 8th is uh when
 
02:27:20.750 --> 02:27:20.760 align:start position:0%
the next uh State primary scheduled the
 
02:27:22.630 --> 02:27:22.640 align:start position:0%
held that's actually the day after Labor
 
02:27:24.590 --> 02:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
Day which you know that having any
 
02:27:26.309 --> 02:27:26.319 align:start position:0%
election on the day after holiday poses
 
02:27:28.990 --> 02:27:29.000 align:start position:0%
some a few logistical difference
 
02:27:30.469 --> 02:27:30.479 align:start position:0%
difficulties they're actually fairly
 
02:27:32.429 --> 02:27:32.439 align:start position:0%
minor we've had like many for example
 
02:27:34.150 --> 02:27:34.160 align:start position:0%
presidential primaries held on the day
 
02:27:36.630 --> 02:27:36.640 align:start position:0%
after well at least we have had at least
 
02:27:38.110 --> 02:27:38.120 align:start position:0%
some presidential primaries for example
 
02:27:39.710 --> 02:27:39.720 align:start position:0%
held on the day after President's Day
 
02:27:43.630 --> 02:27:43.640 align:start position:0%
and we we've managed um anyway as as
 
02:27:45.389 --> 02:27:45.399 align:start position:0%
we've been talking about just a few
 
02:27:46.990 --> 02:27:47.000 align:start position:0%
minutes ago when that happens at
 
02:27:48.429 --> 02:27:48.439 align:start position:0%
Secretary State and the other election
 
02:27:50.750 --> 02:27:50.760 align:start position:0%
officials have 49 days get ready for the
 
02:27:52.590 --> 02:27:52.600 align:start position:0%
general election rather than usual 56
 
02:27:54.349 --> 02:27:54.359 align:start position:0%
day which poses major logistical
 
02:27:56.429 --> 02:27:56.439 align:start position:0%
difficulties just given all not just
 
02:27:59.830 --> 02:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
mailing out the UA ballots but there's
 
02:28:01.309 --> 02:28:01.319 align:start position:0%
all kinds of other things that happens
 
02:28:03.550 --> 02:28:03.560 align:start position:0%
recounts I actually like went through a
 
02:28:04.950 --> 02:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
recount in
 
02:28:08.190 --> 02:28:08.200 align:start position:0%
2022 um there's ballot ballot law
 
02:28:09.870 --> 02:28:09.880 align:start position:0%
commission challenges we had one in
 
02:28:12.309 --> 02:28:12.319 align:start position:0%
straford County shortly after the uh
 
02:28:14.190 --> 02:28:14.200 align:start position:0%
actually after the filing deadline for
 
02:28:16.150 --> 02:28:16.160 align:start position:0%
the county commissioner's office in June
 
02:28:17.830 --> 02:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
and there's all just a variety of other
 
02:28:21.630 --> 02:28:21.640 align:start position:0%
things that can happen so and uh as you
 
02:28:24.150 --> 02:28:24.160 align:start position:0%
also alluded to back in the previous
 
02:28:27.469 --> 02:28:27.479 align:start position:0%
bium the House pass HP 115 so that
 
02:28:29.590 --> 02:28:29.600 align:start position:0%
started out it was introduced as a June
 
02:28:31.950 --> 02:28:31.960 align:start position:0%
primary bill it was amended by
 
02:28:34.110 --> 02:28:34.120 align:start position:0%
bipartisan and veto proof majority in
 
02:28:36.790 --> 02:28:36.800 align:start position:0%
the house to be an August primary bills
 
02:28:39.790 --> 02:28:39.800 align:start position:0%
I think it was the last Tuesday in
 
02:28:43.429 --> 02:28:43.439 align:start position:0%
August and that got turned back into its
 
02:28:46.790 --> 02:28:46.800 align:start position:0%
original form was a June primary by uh
 
02:28:48.269 --> 02:28:48.279 align:start position:0%
is it okay to say the senate in a
 
02:28:50.230 --> 02:28:50.240 align:start position:0%
committee meeting anyway the other
 
02:28:52.110 --> 02:28:52.120 align:start position:0%
legislative chamber on the other side of
 
02:28:52.120 --> 02:28:53.030 align:start position:0%
legislative chamber on the other side of
the

02:28:53.030 --> 02:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:28:56.030 --> 02:28:56.040 align:start position:0%
wall and uh then it went to the
 
02:28:57.950 --> 02:28:57.960 align:start position:0%
committee conference process and the
 
02:29:01.030 --> 02:29:01.040 align:start position:0%
house rejected it um there was a lot of
 
02:29:03.550 --> 02:29:03.560 align:start position:0%
concern that if we pass an August
 
02:29:05.630 --> 02:29:05.640 align:start position:0%
primary bill which I I definitely
 
02:29:06.990 --> 02:29:07.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely think we could have gotten it
 
02:29:10.510 --> 02:29:10.520 align:start position:0%
through the house um the other body um
 
02:29:12.389 --> 02:29:12.399 align:start position:0%
they vot did everything by V votes we
 
02:29:13.710 --> 02:29:13.720 align:start position:0%
don't know what the exact numbers are
 
02:29:16.110 --> 02:29:16.120 align:start position:0%
but it's probably conceivable that 16 of
 
02:29:18.510 --> 02:29:18.520 align:start position:0%
the 24 members of that unnamed body
 
02:29:20.630 --> 02:29:20.640 align:start position:0%
might have been interested in this bill
 
02:29:22.349 --> 02:29:22.359 align:start position:0%
in a in an August
 
02:29:24.230 --> 02:29:24.240 align:start position:0%
primary we're very worried about the
 
02:29:25.990 --> 02:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
governor at various you know all kinds
 
02:29:27.750 --> 02:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
of things um actually the committee
 
02:29:29.710 --> 02:29:29.720 align:start position:0%
report in the house went on and on about
 
02:29:31.309 --> 02:29:31.319 align:start position:0%
like how there's no air conditioning and
 
02:29:34.910 --> 02:29:34.920 align:start position:0%
school houses Etc and I'm not sure why
 
02:29:36.830 --> 02:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
that's an argument for June over August
 
02:29:39.510 --> 02:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
it's both actually August late August is
 
02:29:41.389 --> 02:29:41.399 align:start position:0%
probably like not as hot as mid June
 
02:29:43.830 --> 02:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
when we'd be having a June primary but
 
02:29:45.830 --> 02:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
any case we have a different Governor
 
02:29:48.349 --> 02:29:48.359 align:start position:0%
now so we we um she has different ideas
 
02:29:49.870 --> 02:29:49.880 align:start position:0%
about things I'm not sure if she's
 
02:29:49.880 --> 02:29:51.349 align:start position:0%
about things I'm not sure if she's
really

02:29:51.349 --> 02:29:51.359 align:start position:0%
really
 
02:29:53.469 --> 02:29:53.479 align:start position:0%
Express an opinion on this but anyway
 
02:29:56.150 --> 02:29:56.160 align:start position:0%
the governor who was here two years ago
 
02:29:59.030 --> 02:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
is not there anymore and you know as I
 
02:30:01.710 --> 02:30:01.720 align:start position:0%
said I'm repeating myself but yes that
 
02:30:03.429 --> 02:30:03.439 align:start position:0%
August primary it got through the house
 
02:30:05.790 --> 02:30:05.800 align:start position:0%
with a veto proof veto proof margin so
 
02:30:06.870 --> 02:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
it's a pretty good chance we could have
 
02:30:09.510 --> 02:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
gone to an August Primary in two years
 
02:30:09.520 --> 02:30:10.630 align:start position:0%
gone to an August Primary in two years
ago

02:30:10.630 --> 02:30:10.640 align:start position:0%
ago
 
02:30:13.429 --> 02:30:13.439 align:start position:0%
so what's what's the good side about it
 
02:30:16.429 --> 02:30:16.439 align:start position:0%
well if we has HB 408 the election
 
02:30:17.950 --> 02:30:17.960 align:start position:0%
officials would have several more weeks
 
02:30:19.590 --> 02:30:19.600 align:start position:0%
prepare for the general election I think
 
02:30:22.190 --> 02:30:22.200 align:start position:0%
we would have if I remember if I did my
 
02:30:26.030 --> 02:30:26.040 align:start position:0%
math correctly it'll be either 70 days
 
02:30:28.429 --> 02:30:28.439 align:start position:0%
which is 10 weeks or 77 days which is 11
 
02:30:30.349 --> 02:30:30.359 align:start position:0%
weeks anyway they have a much more
 
02:30:32.150 --> 02:30:32.160 align:start position:0%
comfortable cushion before you know they
 
02:30:33.750 --> 02:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
have to send out the yukaba ballots
 
02:30:35.269 --> 02:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
before they do all the recounts and any
 
02:30:38.429 --> 02:30:38.439 align:start position:0%
ballot law commission um challenges and
 
02:30:41.269 --> 02:30:41.279 align:start position:0%
so forth and I think a late primary is a
 
02:30:43.349 --> 02:30:43.359 align:start position:0%
good thing first of all gives voters
 
02:30:44.910 --> 02:30:44.920 align:start position:0%
more time to make their
 
02:30:47.110 --> 02:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
choices um and also less unknown
 
02:30:48.550 --> 02:30:48.560 align:start position:0%
candidates have more time to catch up
 
02:30:50.510 --> 02:30:50.520 align:start position:0%
with the Front Runners um
 
02:30:51.870 --> 02:30:51.880 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the governor's race
 
02:30:54.190 --> 02:30:54.200 align:start position:0%
last time and actually we had contested
 
02:30:56.710 --> 02:30:56.720 align:start position:0%
primaries in both parties for governor
 
02:30:59.110 --> 02:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
but in the case of on the Republican
 
02:31:01.510 --> 02:31:01.520 align:start position:0%
side Governor ayat like out distance you
 
02:31:04.630 --> 02:31:04.640 align:start position:0%
know she was beat all her Challengers by
 
02:31:07.670 --> 02:31:07.680 align:start position:0%
a huge margin although we had two fairly
 
02:31:09.110 --> 02:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
evenly matched candidates on the
 
02:31:10.910 --> 02:31:10.920 align:start position:0%
Democratic side I'm not necessar if they
 
02:31:12.550 --> 02:31:12.560 align:start position:0%
necessarily drove each other to the left
 
02:31:13.590 --> 02:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure whether they're going
 
02:31:15.870 --> 02:31:15.880 align:start position:0%
farther the left was necessarily a bad
 
02:31:18.030 --> 02:31:18.040 align:start position:0%
inherently a bad thing but anyway we did
 
02:31:21.429 --> 02:31:21.439 align:start position:0%
have two Challengers and actually the
 
02:31:23.190 --> 02:31:23.200 align:start position:0%
one I think was better known Statewide
 
02:31:24.750 --> 02:31:24.760 align:start position:0%
ended up prevailing anyway that was
 
02:31:29.510 --> 02:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
Joyce Craig although so I think and as
 
02:31:31.389 --> 02:31:31.399 align:start position:0%
legislative candidate it's much better
 
02:31:33.590 --> 02:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
for legislative candidates like us and
 
02:31:34.830 --> 02:31:34.840 align:start position:0%
I've actually I've been through actually
 
02:31:36.630 --> 02:31:36.640 align:start position:0%
several contested primaries even though
 
02:31:38.190 --> 02:31:38.200 align:start position:0%
I'm in a very blue District so whoever
 
02:31:39.429 --> 02:31:39.439 align:start position:0%
comes out of the
 
02:31:42.190 --> 02:31:42.200 align:start position:0%
primary you'd have to run a really
 
02:31:45.510 --> 02:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
really bad campaign to lose in my in U
 
02:31:47.790 --> 02:31:47.800 align:start position:0%
in my district but we we've had a number
 
02:31:50.870 --> 02:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
of contestant primaries and uh
 
02:31:54.590 --> 02:31:54.600 align:start position:0%
which uh so that gives um that gives the
 
02:31:56.190 --> 02:31:56.200 align:start position:0%
challengers more time to catch up with
 
02:32:00.070 --> 02:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
the incumbents but also it's it's um the
 
02:32:01.230 --> 02:32:01.240 align:start position:0%
later primary is better for the
 
02:32:03.389 --> 02:32:03.399 align:start position:0%
incumbents do just for the simple reason
 
02:32:05.429 --> 02:32:05.439 align:start position:0%
that uh sure we can walk and chew gum at
 
02:32:07.110 --> 02:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
the same time but it's probably better
 
02:32:09.870 --> 02:32:09.880 align:start position:0%
to do one or the other if we have the
 
02:32:12.990 --> 02:32:13.000 align:start position:0%
choice um so that you know that you know
 
02:32:14.630 --> 02:32:14.640 align:start position:0%
that gives it if we if we head the
 
02:32:16.550 --> 02:32:16.560 align:start position:0%
primary in June the filing deadline
 
02:32:18.910 --> 02:32:18.920 align:start position:0%
moves forward to to March and that you
 
02:32:20.309 --> 02:32:20.319 align:start position:0%
know a lot of times people haven't even
 
02:32:21.990 --> 02:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
decided what they want to do over the
 
02:32:23.830 --> 02:32:23.840 align:start position:0%
next two years by March you know like
 
02:32:26.030 --> 02:32:26.040 align:start position:0%
lots of people make the decision based
 
02:32:28.510 --> 02:32:28.520 align:start position:0%
on what happens in the last you know few
 
02:32:30.230 --> 02:32:30.240 align:start position:0%
last couple months of the second year
 
02:32:34.710 --> 02:32:34.720 align:start position:0%
session and um also then you'll be busy
 
02:32:36.550 --> 02:32:36.560 align:start position:0%
both for the uh incumbents and the
 
02:32:38.950 --> 02:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
challengers you're you know raising
 
02:32:40.750 --> 02:32:40.760 align:start position:0%
money which I have no objection to I'm a
 
02:32:43.510 --> 02:32:43.520 align:start position:0%
capitalist I mean money may play I think
 
02:32:45.510 --> 02:32:45.520 align:start position:0%
money has a role in politics maybe too
 
02:32:48.309 --> 02:32:48.319 align:start position:0%
big a role but I'm not uh I'm not averse
 
02:32:50.030 --> 02:32:50.040 align:start position:0%
to collecting donations and spending
 
02:32:52.110 --> 02:32:52.120 align:start position:0%
money and sending out mailers and doing
 
02:32:55.630 --> 02:32:55.640 align:start position:0%
other things um so it You' be doing that
 
02:32:56.870 --> 02:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
at the same time you're also trying to
 
02:32:58.830 --> 02:32:58.840 align:start position:0%
do your legislative job you be putting
 
02:33:01.389 --> 02:33:01.399 align:start position:0%
out your signs in the spring doing all
 
02:33:04.150 --> 02:33:04.160 align:start position:0%
kinds of things just I think the current
 
02:33:05.550 --> 02:33:05.560 align:start position:0%
life cycle of the at least the
 
02:33:07.429 --> 02:33:07.439 align:start position:0%
legislative elections it's it's a lot
 
02:33:09.190 --> 02:33:09.200 align:start position:0%
better to be doing that in the summer
 
02:33:10.990 --> 02:33:11.000 align:start position:0%
after most of your legislative work is
 
02:33:14.389 --> 02:33:14.399 align:start position:0%
is done so especially especially in this
 
02:33:16.070 --> 02:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
cycle when the legislative office will
 
02:33:17.910 --> 02:33:17.920 align:start position:0%
be will be closed and we'll be up the
 
02:33:20.389 --> 02:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
streets so we won't um
 
02:33:22.190 --> 02:33:22.200 align:start position:0%
we'll probably be having like very very
 
02:33:24.910 --> 02:33:24.920 align:start position:0%
we'll be having even fewer meetings
 
02:33:27.910 --> 02:33:27.920 align:start position:0%
during the summer of of 2026 than usual
 
02:33:30.429 --> 02:33:30.439 align:start position:0%
but that's uh neither that's a topic for
 
02:33:32.710 --> 02:33:32.720 align:start position:0%
a different committee so I just think
 
02:33:35.309 --> 02:33:35.319 align:start position:0%
it's better to have filing year near the
 
02:33:37.110 --> 02:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
end of the second year session and I
 
02:33:38.910 --> 02:33:38.920 align:start position:0%
think also having a later primary is
 
02:33:41.469 --> 02:33:41.479 align:start position:0%
good for the voters also because also
 
02:33:43.190 --> 02:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
like the issues that they're deciding in
 
02:33:44.910 --> 02:33:44.920 align:start position:0%
August or September like to be similar
 
02:33:46.870 --> 02:33:46.880 align:start position:0%
to what they're deciding on November so
 
02:33:49.110 --> 02:33:49.120 align:start position:0%
we move it all the way forward to June
 
02:33:50.389 --> 02:33:50.399 align:start position:0%
there'll be some case is where we'll
 
02:33:52.790 --> 02:33:52.800 align:start position:0%
nominate somebody in June and then it'll
 
02:33:54.550 --> 02:33:54.560 align:start position:0%
turn out to be a bad idea because of
 
02:33:56.389 --> 02:33:56.399 align:start position:0%
what happens between you know June and
 
02:33:58.349 --> 02:33:58.359 align:start position:0%
November and you'll also have the
 
02:34:01.469 --> 02:34:01.479 align:start position:0%
problem as we've seen in other states
 
02:34:03.110 --> 02:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
where people get nominated and then
 
02:34:04.790 --> 02:34:04.800 align:start position:0%
decide they don't want to run after all
 
02:34:06.230 --> 02:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
and then you have to Scurry around and
 
02:34:07.349 --> 02:34:07.359 align:start position:0%
go through the whole process for
 
02:34:10.590 --> 02:34:10.600 align:start position:0%
replacing the nominees so I've um
 
02:34:12.429 --> 02:34:12.439 align:start position:0%
probably given way too many reasons but
 
02:34:14.630 --> 02:34:14.640 align:start position:0%
anyway I just think it's I think we need
 
02:34:16.269 --> 02:34:16.279 align:start position:0%
a slightly longer window but I don't
 
02:34:18.389 --> 02:34:18.399 align:start position:0%
know whether totally I think it's not
 
02:34:19.710 --> 02:34:19.720 align:start position:0%
necessarily the totally restruct
 
02:34:21.590 --> 02:34:21.600 align:start position:0%
structure the whole way our election
 
02:34:23.309 --> 02:34:23.319 align:start position:0%
cycle works so therefore that's why I
 
02:34:26.309 --> 02:34:26.319 align:start position:0%
think a late August primary um which
 
02:34:28.150 --> 02:34:28.160 align:start position:0%
several other states have like including
 
02:34:29.950 --> 02:34:29.960 align:start position:0%
our neighbor across the Connecticut
 
02:34:31.469 --> 02:34:31.479 align:start position:0%
River or should we be calling it The New
 
02:34:33.309 --> 02:34:33.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire River now but anyway the our
 
02:34:34.550 --> 02:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
neighbor on the other side the connectic
 
02:34:36.870 --> 02:34:36.880 align:start position:0%
riv Vermont does it and it works well
 
02:34:39.750 --> 02:34:39.760 align:start position:0%
and so I would uh I would urge you to uh
 
02:34:41.389 --> 02:34:41.399 align:start position:0%
I would urge you to pass this bill like
 
02:34:42.950 --> 02:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
we had the chance two years ago we have
 
02:34:44.309 --> 02:34:44.319 align:start position:0%
another chance now so I think we should
 
02:34:47.150 --> 02:34:47.160 align:start position:0%
take advantage of it so i' be happy to
 
02:34:48.870 --> 02:34:48.880 align:start position:0%
take any questions okay thank you are
 
02:34:51.830 --> 02:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
there any questions from the
 
02:34:53.790 --> 02:34:53.800 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you very
 
02:34:55.870 --> 02:34:55.880 align:start position:0%
much for your
 
02:34:59.630 --> 02:34:59.640 align:start position:0%
testimony uh next up I have a uh request
 
02:35:02.429 --> 02:35:02.439 align:start position:0%
from Secretary of State David scandin to
 
02:35:04.550 --> 02:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
testify and thank you for joining us
 
02:35:04.560 --> 02:35:05.389 align:start position:0%
testify and thank you for joining us
once

02:35:05.389 --> 02:35:05.399 align:start position:0%
once
 
02:35:07.950 --> 02:35:07.960 align:start position:0%
again well thank you Mr chairman members
 
02:35:10.230 --> 02:35:10.240 align:start position:0%
of the committee I'm David scandin
 
02:35:13.230 --> 02:35:13.240 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State and as consistent
 
02:35:15.550 --> 02:35:15.560 align:start position:0%
with past years I would Express a
 
02:35:18.630 --> 02:35:18.640 align:start position:0%
preference for uh an August
 
02:35:21.150 --> 02:35:21.160 align:start position:0%
primary that's not to say that the
 
02:35:25.110 --> 02:35:25.120 align:start position:0%
reasons for a June primary are not valid
 
02:35:27.030 --> 02:35:27.040 align:start position:0%
and I think uh representative Schultz
 
02:35:30.349 --> 02:35:30.359 align:start position:0%
and Barry did a good job explaining uh
 
02:35:32.110 --> 02:35:32.120 align:start position:0%
you know their concerns that is more of
 
02:35:34.910 --> 02:35:34.920 align:start position:0%
a political component than than a
 
02:35:37.630 --> 02:35:37.640 align:start position:0%
logistical one which is what I'm going
 
02:35:42.750 --> 02:35:42.760 align:start position:0%
to focus on uh my remarks um there's no
 
02:35:46.790 --> 02:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
question that we need to move the
 
02:35:49.309 --> 02:35:49.319 align:start position:0%
primary further back from the general
 
02:35:49.319 --> 02:35:50.790 align:start position:0%
primary further back from the general
election

02:35:50.790 --> 02:35:50.800 align:start position:0%
election
 
02:35:54.469 --> 02:35:54.479 align:start position:0%
um we are on a really tight time
 
02:35:56.790 --> 02:35:56.800 align:start position:0%
frame uh in meeting the federal
 
02:35:59.429 --> 02:35:59.439 align:start position:0%
requirement of getting absentee ballots
 
02:36:02.670 --> 02:36:02.680 align:start position:0%
out to Military and overseas citizens
 
02:36:06.670 --> 02:36:06.680 align:start position:0%
they're known as uocava voters and uh
 
02:36:08.309 --> 02:36:08.319 align:start position:0%
when we have to conduct
 
02:36:12.670 --> 02:36:12.680 align:start position:0%
recounts in that in a very narrow window
 
02:36:15.510 --> 02:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
um it can be challenging and I can tell
 
02:36:17.990 --> 02:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
you that I was holding my breath in the
 
02:36:21.309 --> 02:36:21.319 align:start position:0%
last primary because there were a number
 
02:36:25.349 --> 02:36:25.359 align:start position:0%
of hotly contested races uh for Congress
 
02:36:29.469 --> 02:36:29.479 align:start position:0%
and Governor that you know at least
 
02:36:31.190 --> 02:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
right before the election looked like
 
02:36:33.469 --> 02:36:33.479 align:start position:0%
they could be close enough to Warrant a
 
02:36:36.550 --> 02:36:36.560 align:start position:0%
recount and uh had that happened we
 
02:36:37.990 --> 02:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
would have gotten the job done but it
 
02:36:41.030 --> 02:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
would have been a Monumental task so my
 
02:36:44.309 --> 02:36:44.319 align:start position:0%
concern overall is spreading out the
 
02:36:47.349 --> 02:36:47.359 align:start position:0%
workload of Elections over the course of
 
02:36:50.870 --> 02:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
a year a June primary
 
02:36:54.990 --> 02:36:55.000 align:start position:0%
uh would mean a March filing period and
 
02:36:57.349 --> 02:36:57.359 align:start position:0%
it would mean ballot preparation shortly
 
02:36:59.950 --> 02:36:59.960 align:start position:0%
after that that's at a time of year of
 
02:37:02.830 --> 02:37:02.840 align:start position:0%
course when many towns most towns in the
 
02:37:05.190 --> 02:37:05.200 align:start position:0%
state are holding their Town elections
 
02:37:07.110 --> 02:37:07.120 align:start position:0%
and their Town meetings and so there's
 
02:37:10.870 --> 02:37:10.880 align:start position:0%
already a significant workload for uh
 
02:37:13.870 --> 02:37:13.880 align:start position:0%
local election officials and also my
 
02:37:17.309 --> 02:37:17.319 align:start position:0%
office and being a resource to the are
 
02:37:20.230 --> 02:37:20.240 align:start position:0%
uh pretty well attended by voters
 
02:37:22.269 --> 02:37:22.279 align:start position:0%
and I think in August state would would
 
02:37:25.550 --> 02:37:25.560 align:start position:0%
continue that uh that process it would
 
02:37:28.550 --> 02:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
keep a filing period sometime in the
 
02:37:31.110 --> 02:37:31.120 align:start position:0%
June May June time frame that it
 
02:37:32.790 --> 02:37:32.800 align:start position:0%
currently is I think that would have
 
02:37:35.309 --> 02:37:35.319 align:start position:0%
less impact on local election officials
 
02:37:40.070 --> 02:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
dealing with Town elections and U uh
 
02:37:41.630 --> 02:37:41.640 align:start position:0%
that's the reason why I would favor this
 
02:37:44.590 --> 02:37:44.600 align:start position:0%
bill a little more than the other one so
 
02:37:46.469 --> 02:37:46.479 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to answer any questions
 
02:37:48.190 --> 02:37:48.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr secretary do we have any
 
02:37:52.030 --> 02:37:52.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:54.910 --> 02:37:54.920 align:start position:0%
uh representative wood thank you Mr
 
02:37:57.750 --> 02:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
chairman for take ask for allowing me
 
02:38:00.150 --> 02:38:00.160 align:start position:0%
ask a question thank you Secretary of
 
02:38:00.160 --> 02:38:01.510 align:start position:0%
ask a question thank you Secretary of
State

02:38:01.510 --> 02:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
State
 
02:38:04.510 --> 02:38:04.520 align:start position:0%
um it just seems like a lot of effort to
 
02:38:07.550 --> 02:38:07.560 align:start position:0%
move it just a few weeks uh to give you
 
02:38:10.870 --> 02:38:10.880 align:start position:0%
a few more weeks uh time that can you
 
02:38:14.150 --> 02:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
you know why the last Tuesday of August
 
02:38:17.030 --> 02:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
I mean holidays I I just don't
 
02:38:19.830 --> 02:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
see how how you're going to get the
 
02:38:21.469 --> 02:38:21.479 align:start position:0%
relief that you're looking for so can
 
02:38:24.309 --> 02:38:24.319 align:start position:0%
you explain that to me I think two weeks
 
02:38:28.110 --> 02:38:28.120 align:start position:0%
makes a very big difference and in the
 
02:38:30.710 --> 02:38:30.720 align:start position:0%
time frame of what we have to work with
 
02:38:33.630 --> 02:38:33.640 align:start position:0%
after an election uh we could conduct a
 
02:38:37.750 --> 02:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
major recount in a two-e period so I
 
02:38:40.349 --> 02:38:40.359 align:start position:0%
think it it takes that that concern off
 
02:38:42.110 --> 02:38:42.120 align:start position:0%
the table and we would be able to meet
 
02:38:44.710 --> 02:38:44.720 align:start position:0%
our requirements to our military
 
02:38:47.670 --> 02:38:47.680 align:start position:0%
personnel that want to vote by absentee
 
02:38:51.309 --> 02:38:51.319 align:start position:0%
ballot the the other consideration that
 
02:38:54.070 --> 02:38:54.080 align:start position:0%
I have is is earlier in the year where
 
02:38:57.030 --> 02:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
we have events prep preparing for the
 
02:38:59.830 --> 02:38:59.840 align:start position:0%
state primary that are in very close
 
02:39:04.550 --> 02:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
proximity to town meetings and you know
 
02:39:08.429 --> 02:39:08.439 align:start position:0%
that causes uh time issues with local
 
02:39:10.389 --> 02:39:10.399 align:start position:0%
election officials and obviously we're
 
02:39:12.110 --> 02:39:12.120 align:start position:0%
very concerned about that want to make
 
02:39:14.190 --> 02:39:14.200 align:start position:0%
sure that you know the whole process
 
02:39:16.429 --> 02:39:16.439 align:start position:0%
runs as smoothly as
 
02:39:18.349 --> 02:39:18.359 align:start position:0%
possible thank
 
02:39:21.870 --> 02:39:21.880 align:start position:0%

02:39:35.349 --> 02:39:35.359 align:start position:0%
you I like having it as close to the
 
02:39:37.309 --> 02:39:37.319 align:start position:0%

name is Lex Bary and I represent Grafton
 
02:41:33.790 --> 02:41:33.800 align:start position:0%
District 11 which includes the town of
 
02:41:37.150 --> 02:41:37.160 align:start position:0%
Grafton Alexandria hebr and gron uh the
 
02:41:39.950 --> 02:41:39.960 align:start position:0%
bill in front of you HB 151 simply
 
02:41:42.190 --> 02:41:42.200 align:start position:0%
reduces the term of the supervisor of
 
02:41:46.110 --> 02:41:46.120 align:start position:0%
the checklist from 6 years to 3 years
 
02:41:48.190 --> 02:41:48.200 align:start position:0%
Cindy Klick a select woman in Grafton
 
02:41:50.110 --> 02:41:50.120 align:start position:0%
requested that I file this this bill in
 
02:41:52.790 --> 02:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
the hopes that reducing the term length
 
02:41:54.429 --> 02:41:54.439 align:start position:0%
will encourage people to run for the
 
02:41:56.910 --> 02:41:56.920 align:start position:0%
supervisor of the checklist the feedback
 
02:41:59.230 --> 02:41:59.240 align:start position:0%
we've received from potential applicants
 
02:42:01.150 --> 02:42:01.160 align:start position:0%
is that six years is too long of a
 
02:42:03.550 --> 02:42:03.560 align:start position:0%
commitment that's basically the bill and
 
02:42:07.550 --> 02:42:07.560 align:start position:0%
the rationale um I've passed around um
 
02:42:09.830 --> 02:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
an amendment uh proposed by uh
 
02:42:12.230 --> 02:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
representative kab uh this amendment
 
02:42:13.910 --> 02:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
acknowledges that the supervisor of the
 
02:42:15.710 --> 02:42:15.720 align:start position:0%
checklist is on the town election and
 
02:42:18.110 --> 02:42:18.120 align:start position:0%
not the general election it also cleans
 
02:42:19.830 --> 02:42:19.840 align:start position:0%
up the language a bit but the intent of
 
02:42:22.429 --> 02:42:22.439 align:start position:0%
the bill remains unchanged um I hope
 
02:42:25.110 --> 02:42:25.120 align:start position:0%
that you will consider uh this amendment
 
02:42:29.230 --> 02:42:29.240 align:start position:0%
and uh pass the bill as amended uh I can
 
02:42:31.030 --> 02:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
take any questions but if you have
 
02:42:32.870 --> 02:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
questions about the rationale and those
 
02:42:34.510 --> 02:42:34.520 align:start position:0%
kinds I think the people speaking behind
 
02:42:36.510 --> 02:42:36.520 align:start position:0%
me would would be able to better answer
 
02:42:38.469 --> 02:42:38.479 align:start position:0%
that thank you okay thank you do we have
 
02:42:40.710 --> 02:42:40.720 align:start position:0%
any questions from the
 
02:42:42.710 --> 02:42:42.720 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you very
 
02:42:44.950 --> 02:42:44.960 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony thank you I am
 
02:42:47.870 --> 02:42:47.880 align:start position:0%
I'm going to defer at this moment to
 
02:42:49.630 --> 02:42:49.640 align:start position:0%
secretary scanland
 
02:42:52.590 --> 02:42:52.600 align:start position:0%
so he can return to his other duties
 
02:42:55.429 --> 02:42:55.439 align:start position:0%
more quickly thank you Mr secetary thank
 
02:42:56.830 --> 02:42:56.840 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman I appreciate you letting
 
02:42:59.510 --> 02:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
me do my job um you're
 
02:43:01.910 --> 02:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
welcome uh so I'm David scanland
 
02:43:04.349 --> 02:43:04.359 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State uh and I support this
 
02:43:08.950 --> 02:43:08.960 align:start position:0%
bill uh just briefly you know when uh
 
02:43:10.710 --> 02:43:10.720 align:start position:0%
individuals are looking for at running
 
02:43:13.790 --> 02:43:13.800 align:start position:0%
for this office uh they see a six-year
 
02:43:16.230 --> 02:43:16.240 align:start position:0%
term in front of it and that is pretty
 
02:43:18.950 --> 02:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
intimidating uh I think this is a time
 
02:43:20.910 --> 02:43:20.920 align:start position:0%
when when we're trying to encourage
 
02:43:23.670 --> 02:43:23.680 align:start position:0%
people to participate uh in local
 
02:43:26.550 --> 02:43:26.560 align:start position:0%
elections and run for office uh there's
 
02:43:28.550 --> 02:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
been a decline in that department uh
 
02:43:30.750 --> 02:43:30.760 align:start position:0%
over time and I think having a
 
02:43:32.750 --> 02:43:32.760 align:start position:0%
three-year term is certainly more
 
02:43:35.630 --> 02:43:35.640 align:start position:0%
appealing to people if they know it's uh
 
02:43:38.750 --> 02:43:38.760 align:start position:0%
not a lifelong commitment so um with
 
02:43:40.790 --> 02:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
that I'd be happy to answer any
 
02:43:42.870 --> 02:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
questions okay thank you do we have any
 
02:43:44.990 --> 02:43:45.000 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
02:43:47.510 --> 02:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
representative Ward thank you Mr chair
 
02:43:49.150 --> 02:43:49.160 align:start position:0%
thank you secretary scandin could you
 
02:43:51.389 --> 02:43:51.399 align:start position:0%
just confirm for someone who's desperate
 
02:43:53.910 --> 02:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
to know that this only applies to towns
 
02:43:57.710 --> 02:43:57.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:01.110 --> 02:44:01.120 align:start position:0%
cities this would be for elections for
 
02:44:03.790 --> 02:44:03.800 align:start position:0%
Town supervisors of the checklist cities
 
02:44:05.910 --> 02:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
are a little bit different and that they
 
02:44:09.150 --> 02:44:09.160 align:start position:0%
appoint registrars to maintain the
 
02:44:13.349 --> 02:44:13.359 align:start position:0%
checklist so yes follow up in our city
 
02:44:16.910 --> 02:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
they get elected okay for two-year terms
 
02:44:19.150 --> 02:44:19.160 align:start position:0%
so it's this does not apply to cities I
 
02:44:20.710 --> 02:44:20.720 align:start position:0%
no no this would be for towns all right
 
02:44:20.720 --> 02:44:22.389 align:start position:0%
no no this would be for towns all right
thank

02:44:22.389 --> 02:44:22.399 align:start position:0%
thank
 
02:44:26.429 --> 02:44:26.439 align:start position:0%
you are there further questions from the
 
02:44:28.429 --> 02:44:28.439 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you very
 
02:44:33.150 --> 02:44:33.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:36.910 --> 02:44:36.920 align:start position:0%
you uh next up is Cindy
 
02:44:44.150 --> 02:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:44.160 --> 02:44:47.030 align:start position:0%
 
today

02:44:47.030 --> 02:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
today
 
02:44:49.710 --> 02:44:49.720 align:start position:0%
the my name is Cindy click and just a
 
02:44:51.590 --> 02:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
slight correction of a former selectman
 
02:44:53.269 --> 02:44:53.279 align:start position:0%
in the town of graft and I am no longer
 
02:44:56.349 --> 02:44:56.359 align:start position:0%
one but um I'll be brief everybody wants
 
02:44:57.550 --> 02:44:57.560 align:start position:0%
to get to lunch and I'm just going to
 
02:44:59.269 --> 02:44:59.279 align:start position:0%
repeat what the first two gentlemen
 
02:45:03.349 --> 02:45:03.359 align:start position:0%
already had to say um I asked him uh
 
02:45:05.269 --> 02:45:05.279 align:start position:0%
representative brne to submit the bill
 
02:45:07.110 --> 02:45:07.120 align:start position:0%
for the legislature's consideration this
 
02:45:08.750 --> 02:45:08.760 align:start position:0%
session because we had two of our three
 
02:45:10.790 --> 02:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
supervisors at the checklist resign last
 
02:45:12.670 --> 02:45:12.680 align:start position:0%
year in our town and we were hard
 
02:45:14.110 --> 02:45:14.120 align:start position:0%
pressed to find people who were
 
02:45:15.429 --> 02:45:15.439 align:start position:0%
interested in making such a long
 
02:45:17.750 --> 02:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
commitment even now we have an open seat
 
02:45:20.309 --> 02:45:20.319 align:start position:0%
that no one signed up to run for as I'm
 
02:45:22.790 --> 02:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
sure most of you know uh finding
 
02:45:24.429 --> 02:45:24.439 align:start position:0%
volunteers is a real challenge these
 
02:45:26.230 --> 02:45:26.240 align:start position:0%
days so our hope is that changing the
 
02:45:28.110 --> 02:45:28.120 align:start position:0%
term from six years to three years will
 
02:45:30.230 --> 02:45:30.240 align:start position:0%

02:46:15.040 --> 02:46:17.030 align:start position:0%
Gilmore thank you
um

02:46:17.030 --> 02:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:46:19.590 --> 02:46:19.600 align:start position:0%
the as the supervisor the checklist
 
02:46:22.590 --> 02:46:22.600 align:start position:0%
myself for three or four terms I could
 
02:46:24.670 --> 02:46:24.680 align:start position:0%
not believe I would ever sign up for a
 
02:46:27.510 --> 02:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
six-year term um but that's not my
 
02:46:29.750 --> 02:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
question my question really is um what
 
02:46:33.590 --> 02:46:33.600 align:start position:0%
about I in the Ci's um my city it's a
 
02:46:36.750 --> 02:46:36.760 align:start position:0%
two-year term is two or three
 
02:46:38.630 --> 02:46:38.640 align:start position:0%
preferable to
 
02:46:41.349 --> 02:46:41.359 align:start position:0%
you I I think considering how much there
 
02:46:44.269 --> 02:46:44.279 align:start position:0%
is to do with the job I I think three
 
02:46:46.990 --> 02:46:47.000 align:start position:0%
years makes more sense and in two years
 
02:46:50.230 --> 02:46:50.240 align:start position:0%
I think it I I I've never done it I've
 
02:46:53.790 --> 02:46:53.800 align:start position:0%
never done the job I don't know um we
 
02:46:55.830 --> 02:46:55.840 align:start position:0%
like like the previous question that uh
 
02:46:58.110 --> 02:46:58.120 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State scanland answered
 
02:47:00.269 --> 02:47:00.279 align:start position:0%
this is just for towns so it wouldn't
 
02:47:00.279 --> 02:47:02.830 align:start position:0%
this is just for towns so it wouldn't
affect

02:47:02.830 --> 02:47:02.840 align:start position:0%
affect
 
02:47:05.550 --> 02:47:05.560 align:start position:0%
cities okay further questions from the
 
02:47:07.710 --> 02:47:07.720 align:start position:0%
committee representative Newsome did I
 
02:47:09.710 --> 02:47:09.720 align:start position:0%
see your hand up no
 
02:47:12.349 --> 02:47:12.359 align:start position:0%
okay so see seeing no other questions
 
02:47:20.510 --> 02:47:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:28.389 --> 02:47:28.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:28.399 --> 02:47:32.590 align:start position:0%
 
estadio

02:47:32.590 --> 02:47:32.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:35.349 --> 02:47:35.359 align:start position:0%
observing thank you representative qu I
 
02:47:39.750 --> 02:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
just have very brief remarks um one from
 
02:47:42.190 --> 02:47:42.200 align:start position:0%
Jeffrey Smith of eeping he is in
 
02:47:45.710 --> 02:47:45.720 align:start position:0%
opposition to hb1 151 he says this is
 
02:47:47.269 --> 02:47:47.279 align:start position:0%
because it overlooks the extensive
 
02:47:48.830 --> 02:47:48.840 align:start position:0%
knowledge and experience the position
 
02:47:50.630 --> 02:47:50.640 align:start position:0%
position requires in order to support
 
02:47:52.269 --> 02:47:52.279 align:start position:0%
free and fair election
 
02:47:55.269 --> 02:47:55.279 align:start position:0%
processes and then I also have testimony
 
02:47:58.830 --> 02:47:58.840 align:start position:0%
from Karen Dodge of der um she says as a
 
02:48:00.590 --> 02:48:00.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire constituent and voter I
 
02:48:03.269 --> 02:48:03.279 align:start position:0%
ask that you please oppose HB 151
 
02:48:05.030 --> 02:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
changing the supervisor of checkless
 
02:48:07.230 --> 02:48:07.240 align:start position:0%
term of office from six years to three
 
02:48:10.429 --> 02:48:10.439 align:start position:0%
would be unwise a six-year term allows
 
02:48:12.269 --> 02:48:12.279 align:start position:0%
each supervisor to hold office through
 
02:48:14.429 --> 02:48:14.439 align:start position:0%
all the various types of Elections
 
02:48:17.269 --> 02:48:17.279 align:start position:0%
presidential state and local and she
 
02:48:19.030 --> 02:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
reasons that this is important so that
 
02:48:20.790 --> 02:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
the knowledge of each type of election
 
02:48:22.790 --> 02:48:22.800 align:start position:0%
is run and can be passed on to newly
 
02:48:22.800 --> 02:48:24.070 align:start position:0%
is run and can be passed on to newly
elected

02:48:24.070 --> 02:48:24.080 align:start position:0%

03:59:03.550 --> 03:59:03.560 align:start position:0%
Rockingham 10 new market and new Fields
 
03:59:06.389 --> 03:59:06.399 align:start position:0%
uh for those of you who may be new or
 
03:59:08.750 --> 03:59:08.760 align:start position:0%
not familiar I will briefly go through
 
03:59:10.630 --> 03:59:10.640 align:start position:0%
rank Choice voting as a concept and then
 
03:59:12.670 --> 03:59:12.680 align:start position:0%
get into the specifics of the bill rank
 
03:59:14.590 --> 03:59:14.600 align:start position:0%
Choice voting is a system of voting that
 
03:59:17.510 --> 03:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
is designed to select the winner with
 
03:59:20.790 --> 03:59:20.800 align:start position:0%
the most support sounds reasonable right
 
03:59:23.309 --> 03:59:23.319 align:start position:0%
um it eliminates in doing that it
 
03:59:24.710 --> 03:59:24.720 align:start position:0%
eliminates some of the problems with our
 
03:59:26.389 --> 03:59:26.399 align:start position:0%
current system which we call first pass
 
03:59:28.710 --> 03:59:28.720 align:start position:0%
the post those problems being what we
 
03:59:31.070 --> 03:59:31.080 align:start position:0%
call vote splitting or or the spoiler
 
03:59:33.630 --> 03:59:33.640 align:start position:0%
effect um and also the need for
 
03:59:36.550 --> 03:59:36.560 align:start position:0%
strategic voting and I'll get into that
 
03:59:40.590 --> 03:59:40.600 align:start position:0%
um the first ranked voting system was uh
 
03:59:42.510 --> 03:59:42.520 align:start position:0%
proposed by a philosopher by the name of
 
03:59:45.510 --> 03:59:45.520 align:start position:0%
Raman lul um who is out of where we
 
03:59:48.670 --> 03:59:48.680 align:start position:0%
currently call Spain um in the late
 
03:59:51.030 --> 03:59:51.040 align:start position:0%
1200s uh the first country that adopted
 
03:59:53.030 --> 03:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
it was Denmark In
 
03:59:55.349 --> 03:59:55.359 align:start position:0%
1855 it was adopted for national
 
03:59:57.910 --> 03:59:57.920 align:start position:0%
elections by Australia and Ireland over
 
04:00:00.269 --> 04:00:00.279 align:start position:0%
a hundred years ago in all of this
 
04:00:02.349 --> 04:00:02.359 align:start position:0%
obviously is before voting
 
04:00:05.750 --> 04:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
machines um and today it's used by many
 
04:00:09.510 --> 04:00:09.520 align:start position:0%
countries uh including uh Malta and
 
04:00:11.469 --> 04:00:11.479 align:start position:0%
South Africa where it was proposed and
 
04:00:14.030 --> 04:00:14.040 align:start position:0%
successfully reduced uh civil tensions
 
04:00:15.830 --> 04:00:15.840 align:start position:0%
was the reason for one of the reasons
 
04:00:19.269 --> 04:00:19.279 align:start position:0%
for its uh adoption it's used in dozens
 
04:00:21.630 --> 04:00:21.640 align:start position:0%
of municipalities in the US going back
 
04:00:24.309 --> 04:00:24.319 align:start position:0%
for over a century here in in the US
 
04:00:26.149 --> 04:00:26.159 align:start position:0%
it's used by the States of Maine and
 
04:00:28.750 --> 04:00:28.760 align:start position:0%
Alaska and it's used by Southern States
 
04:00:31.110 --> 04:00:31.120 align:start position:0%
which have runoff elections for their
 
04:00:33.110 --> 04:00:33.120 align:start position:0%
absentee overseas
 
04:00:35.670 --> 04:00:35.680 align:start position:0%
ballots um and I'll get into why that is
 
04:00:37.309 --> 04:00:37.319 align:start position:0%
in a minute it's also used by hundreds
 
04:00:39.510 --> 04:00:39.520 align:start position:0%
of large universities corporations and
 
04:00:41.269 --> 04:00:41.279 align:start position:0%
organizations and has been for quite a
 
04:00:44.110 --> 04:00:44.120 align:start position:0%
while so the problem is that when you
 
04:00:45.630 --> 04:00:45.640 align:start position:0%
have three or more candidates running
 
04:00:48.630 --> 04:00:48.640 align:start position:0%
for one seat you may very well end up
 
04:00:50.910 --> 04:00:50.920 align:start position:0%
with a winner which we call a low
 
04:00:52.469 --> 04:00:52.479 align:start position:0%
plurality winner this is a winner that
 
04:00:55.750 --> 04:00:55.760 align:start position:0%
has less than 50% so you may with three
 
04:00:57.070 --> 04:00:57.080 align:start position:0%
people running you may end up with a
 
04:00:59.510 --> 04:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
winner with only 34% which means you
 
04:01:02.189 --> 04:01:02.199 align:start position:0%
have 66% of the voters that may have
 
04:01:04.110 --> 04:01:04.120 align:start position:0%
wanted one or the other of the people
 
04:01:06.149 --> 04:01:06.159 align:start position:0%
that didn't win and would have coalesced
 
04:01:07.790 --> 04:01:07.800 align:start position:0%
around that person and definitely didn't
 
04:01:10.590 --> 04:01:10.600 align:start position:0%
want that other person who won so that's
 
04:01:12.670 --> 04:01:12.680 align:start position:0%
what we call the vote splitting problem
 
04:01:14.590 --> 04:01:14.600 align:start position:0%
and because we have that vote splitting
 
04:01:17.510 --> 04:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
problem that spoiler effect we are
 
04:01:20.590 --> 04:01:20.600 align:start position:0%
forced to strategically vote and by that
 
04:01:22.870 --> 04:01:22.880 align:start position:0%
I mean only two candidates ever matter
 
04:01:24.550 --> 04:01:24.560 align:start position:0%
in an election the way we currently run
 
04:01:26.510 --> 04:01:26.520 align:start position:0%
it with the first pass the post system
 
04:01:28.309 --> 04:01:28.319 align:start position:0%
the candidate in the lead and the
 
04:01:30.429 --> 04:01:30.439 align:start position:0%
candidate who's the closest to knocking
 
04:01:32.590 --> 04:01:32.600 align:start position:0%
out the candidate in the lead everyone
 
04:01:35.110 --> 04:01:35.120 align:start position:0%
else beyond that doesn't matter and if
 
04:01:37.309 --> 04:01:37.319 align:start position:0%
you're voting for them you are throwing
 
04:01:39.830 --> 04:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
away your vote which means that most
 
04:01:41.710 --> 04:01:41.720 align:start position:0%
people don't feel like they get to vote
 
04:01:43.309 --> 04:01:43.319 align:start position:0%
their conscience get to vote for the
 
04:01:44.670 --> 04:01:44.680 align:start position:0%
candidate they truly want because
 
04:01:46.870 --> 04:01:46.880 align:start position:0%
they're forced into one of those two top
 
04:01:50.189 --> 04:01:50.199 align:start position:0%
two candidates um so not only is that a
 
04:01:51.550 --> 04:01:51.560 align:start position:0%
problem in that we don't get to vote our
 
04:01:53.790 --> 04:01:53.800 align:start position:0%
conscience but that creates this forc
 
04:01:56.110 --> 04:01:56.120 align:start position:0%
strategic voting because of the spoiler
 
04:01:59.309 --> 04:01:59.319 align:start position:0%
effect which is why we have our de facto
 
04:02:01.910 --> 04:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
two-party system that everybody decries
 
04:02:04.590 --> 04:02:04.600 align:start position:0%
is terrible that our founding fathers
 
04:02:07.030 --> 04:02:07.040 align:start position:0%
told us over and over again warned us of
 
04:02:09.349 --> 04:02:09.359 align:start position:0%
that um parties would be uh terrible for
 
04:02:12.830 --> 04:02:12.840 align:start position:0%
our democracy so because there's no
 
04:02:15.189 --> 04:02:15.199 align:start position:0%
strategic voting in ranked Choice voting
 
04:02:17.269 --> 04:02:17.279 align:start position:0%
it allows more candidates to run because
 
04:02:19.110 --> 04:02:19.120 align:start position:0%
everybody can run on even playing field
 
04:02:20.950 --> 04:02:20.960 align:start position:0%
you don't get knocked out just because
 
04:02:23.550 --> 04:02:23.560 align:start position:0%
you're not one of the two mainor parties
 
04:02:25.189 --> 04:02:25.199 align:start position:0%
um which means you have elections that
 
04:02:28.229 --> 04:02:28.239 align:start position:0%
represent a broader range of views um
 
04:02:30.269 --> 04:02:30.279 align:start position:0%
and also it increases voter turnout
 
04:02:32.030 --> 04:02:32.040 align:start position:0%
because voters start to feel like their
 
04:02:33.590 --> 04:02:33.600 align:start position:0%
votes matter and that they can vote
 
04:02:33.600 --> 04:02:34.429 align:start position:0%
votes matter and that they can vote
their

04:02:34.429 --> 04:02:34.439 align:start position:0%
their
 
04:02:37.189 --> 04:02:37.199 align:start position:0%
conscience so the way it actually works
 
04:02:39.590 --> 04:02:39.600 align:start position:0%
the nuts and bolts is it works very much
 
04:02:42.070 --> 04:02:42.080 align:start position:0%
like a runoff election in states that
 
04:02:44.590 --> 04:02:44.600 align:start position:0%
have runoff elections you may know
 
04:02:46.429 --> 04:02:46.439 align:start position:0%
that what happens in a runoff election
 
04:02:48.550 --> 04:02:48.560 align:start position:0%
is that If no candidate gets a majority
 
04:02:50.469 --> 04:02:50.479 align:start position:0%
in that first election they will
 
04:02:52.590 --> 04:02:52.600 align:start position:0%
eliminate for runoff election purposes
 
04:02:54.469 --> 04:02:54.479 align:start position:0%
they'll eliminate everybody beneath the
 
04:02:56.149 --> 04:02:56.159 align:start position:0%
the top two candidates and then they'll
 
04:02:58.550 --> 04:02:58.560 align:start position:0%
redo the election and have people vote
 
04:03:01.189 --> 04:03:01.199 align:start position:0%
again the benefit to this is there's no
 
04:03:02.469 --> 04:03:02.479 align:start position:0%
additional election you don't have to
 
04:03:03.910 --> 04:03:03.920 align:start position:0%
wait time you don't have to spend money
 
04:03:05.389 --> 04:03:05.399 align:start position:0%
on an expensive election you don't have
 
04:03:07.429 --> 04:03:07.439 align:start position:0%
to have an reduced voter turnout in that
 
04:03:09.510 --> 04:03:09.520 align:start position:0%
second election you just put who you
 
04:03:12.110 --> 04:03:12.120 align:start position:0%
would vote for in a runoff election on
 
04:03:14.110 --> 04:03:14.120 align:start position:0%
that same piece of paper which is why
 
04:03:15.389 --> 04:03:15.399 align:start position:0%
those southern states that have runoff
 
04:03:17.309 --> 04:03:17.319 align:start position:0%
elections do it for those overseas
 
04:03:18.990 --> 04:03:19.000 align:start position:0%
ballots because they don't have time to
 
04:03:20.990 --> 04:03:21.000 align:start position:0%
send out another ballot so they've been
 
04:03:23.309 --> 04:03:23.319 align:start position:0%
using rank Choice voting for quite some
 
04:03:26.309 --> 04:03:26.319 align:start position:0%
time so on a ballot everyone ranks their
 
04:03:28.349 --> 04:03:28.359 align:start position:0%
preferences it's something that everyone
 
04:03:29.870 --> 04:03:29.880 align:start position:0%
instinctively knows how to do with your
 
04:03:32.110 --> 04:03:32.120 align:start position:0%
ice cream your pizza toppings everybody
 
04:03:33.510 --> 04:03:33.520 align:start position:0%
knows how to rank their favorite
 
04:03:35.590 --> 04:03:35.600 align:start position:0%
whatever um and if there's no majority
 
04:03:38.110 --> 04:03:38.120 align:start position:0%
Runner after running first preferences
 
04:03:40.229 --> 04:03:40.239 align:start position:0%
then the very last not all candidates
 
04:03:42.389 --> 04:03:42.399 align:start position:0%
but the person who comes in last gets
 
04:03:45.149 --> 04:03:45.159 align:start position:0%
eliminated and they're voters then are
 
04:03:47.309 --> 04:03:47.319 align:start position:0%
reallocated to their second preference
 
04:03:49.269 --> 04:03:49.279 align:start position:0%
and you just do that by round until you
 
04:03:51.830 --> 04:03:51.840 align:start position:0%
end up with somebody with a majority or
 
04:03:54.870 --> 04:03:54.880 align:start position:0%
until all the rounds have been completed
 
04:03:56.630 --> 04:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
and so if there's one thing to
 
04:03:58.990 --> 04:03:59.000 align:start position:0%
understand from the RCB as a concept
 
04:04:01.149 --> 04:04:01.159 align:start position:0%
it's that ranked Choice voting is
 
04:04:04.790 --> 04:04:04.800 align:start position:0%
designed to result mathematically with
 
04:04:06.550 --> 04:04:06.560 align:start position:0%
more people happy with the results of
 
04:04:09.030 --> 04:04:09.040 align:start position:0%
the election as opposed to our first
 
04:04:12.510 --> 04:04:12.520 align:start position:0%
pass the post uh system so as for this
 
04:04:15.510 --> 04:04:15.520 align:start position:0%
bill this bill is very simple it is only
 
04:04:17.389 --> 04:04:17.399 align:start position:0%
an enabling Bill and and of itself it
 
04:04:20.070 --> 04:04:20.080 align:start position:0%
does nothing it enables municipalities
 
04:04:22.189 --> 04:04:22.199 align:start position:0%
and only municipalities to adopt rank
 
04:04:24.630 --> 04:04:24.640 align:start position:0%
Choice voting only for Municipal
 
04:04:26.990 --> 04:04:27.000 align:start position:0%
elections only if the town's people
 
04:04:29.110 --> 04:04:29.120 align:start position:0%
choose to adopt it for those Municipal
 
04:04:31.070 --> 04:04:31.080 align:start position:0%
elections so it goes to a vote of the
 
04:04:34.189 --> 04:04:34.199 align:start position:0%
people it allows for the recension of
 
04:04:36.429 --> 04:04:36.439 align:start position:0%
that uh adopting rank Choice voting so
 
04:04:39.149 --> 04:04:39.159 align:start position:0%
they can unadopt it by the same exact
 
04:04:40.670 --> 04:04:40.680 align:start position:0%
method that they adopted it it's not
 
04:04:42.990 --> 04:04:43.000 align:start position:0%
more difficult it allows adoption of
 
04:04:44.750 --> 04:04:44.760 align:start position:0%
rank Choice voting for certain offices
 
04:04:46.670 --> 04:04:46.680 align:start position:0%
and not others if a town wanted to do it
 
04:04:49.269 --> 04:04:49.279 align:start position:0%
just for one office or a few offices and
 
04:04:51.269 --> 04:04:51.279 align:start position:0%
it provides that it has to be adopted at
 
04:04:54.110 --> 04:04:54.120 align:start position:0%
least 90 days before the election for
 
04:04:57.309 --> 04:04:57.319 align:start position:0%
which it's going to apply so Town
 
04:04:59.750 --> 04:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
elections as you uh may have recently
 
04:05:01.510 --> 04:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
spoken about today actually Town
 
04:05:02.670 --> 04:05:02.680 align:start position:0%
elections are
 
04:05:05.269 --> 04:05:05.279 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan um so while some in the past
 
04:05:08.389 --> 04:05:08.399 align:start position:0%
have tried to uh propagate narratives
 
04:05:11.269 --> 04:05:11.279 align:start position:0%
that RCV is somehow a partisan issue um
 
04:05:13.070 --> 04:05:13.080 align:start position:0%
it is impossible for this particular
 
04:05:15.870 --> 04:05:15.880 align:start position:0%
iteration even be partisan I would um
 
04:05:18.030 --> 04:05:18.040 align:start position:0%
argue though that this is desperately
 
04:05:20.510 --> 04:05:20.520 align:start position:0%
needed for cities that have either
 
04:05:22.950 --> 04:05:22.960 align:start position:0%
runoff elections or primary elections
 
04:05:25.429 --> 04:05:25.439 align:start position:0%
like Manchester and nasua because they
 
04:05:28.349 --> 04:05:28.359 align:start position:0%
are holding entirely different new
 
04:05:30.550 --> 04:05:30.560 align:start position:0%
elections costly
 
04:05:32.910 --> 04:05:32.920 align:start position:0%
elections whereas this would save them
 
04:05:35.149 --> 04:05:35.159 align:start position:0%
all that money tens of thousands of
 
04:05:37.070 --> 04:05:37.080 align:start position:0%
dollars at a minimum and I just looked
 
04:05:39.309 --> 04:05:39.319 align:start position:0%
at Manchester's budget yesterday to find
 
04:05:42.309 --> 04:05:42.319 align:start position:0%
out that number so having an additional
 
04:05:43.870 --> 04:05:43.880 align:start position:0%
election whether it's in the form of a
 
04:05:45.790 --> 04:05:45.800 align:start position:0%
municipal primary or in the form of a
 
04:05:48.630 --> 04:05:48.640 align:start position:0%
runoff uh cost the people money it also
 
04:05:51.189 --> 04:05:51.199 align:start position:0%
is reduced turnout people don't like to
 
04:05:53.269 --> 04:05:53.279 align:start position:0%
turn up to the an election twice in
 
04:05:56.389 --> 04:05:56.399 align:start position:0%
within a few months um reduced turnout
 
04:06:00.030 --> 04:06:00.040 align:start position:0%
and lots of time and unnecessary work so
 
04:06:01.550 --> 04:06:01.560 align:start position:0%
these cities will definitely have every
 
04:06:03.429 --> 04:06:03.439 align:start position:0%
reason in the world to opt in the
 
04:06:05.590 --> 04:06:05.600 align:start position:0%
machines that have been certified by the
 
04:06:08.110 --> 04:06:08.120 align:start position:0%
SOS are already rank Choice voting ready
 
04:06:10.550 --> 04:06:10.560 align:start position:0%
they are ready to go results are tallied
 
04:06:12.710 --> 04:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
instantly it's also really quick to do
 
04:06:14.469 --> 04:06:14.479 align:start position:0%
it by hand and in fact we will have a
 
04:06:15.990 --> 04:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
little chocolate demonstration at the
 
04:06:17.710 --> 04:06:17.720 align:start position:0%
end of your day so you can see how
 
04:06:19.870 --> 04:06:19.880 align:start position:0%
quickly you can do a rank Choice voting
 
04:06:23.189 --> 04:06:23.199 align:start position:0%
election by hand um and there is no if
 
04:06:25.710 --> 04:06:25.720 align:start position:0%
if a town or city decide to adopt this
 
04:06:27.469 --> 04:06:27.479 align:start position:0%
there is no end of organizations that
 
04:06:30.189 --> 04:06:30.199 align:start position:0%
are willing to educate educate Andor
 
04:06:32.550 --> 04:06:32.560 align:start position:0%
train um for any town that wants to
 
04:06:34.510 --> 04:06:34.520 align:start position:0%
adopt this so New Hampshire rank Choice
 
04:06:37.269 --> 04:06:37.279 align:start position:0%
voting is ready and willing Fair vote
 
04:06:39.630 --> 04:06:39.640 align:start position:0%
legal Women Voters did education in
 
04:06:41.389 --> 04:06:41.399 align:start position:0%
Maine I imagine they'll be willing to do
 
04:06:42.830 --> 04:06:42.840 align:start position:0%
the same thing here the rank Choice
 
04:06:44.710 --> 04:06:44.720 align:start position:0%
voting resource Center and there are
 
04:06:46.349 --> 04:06:46.359 align:start position:0%
more organizations than that so there
 
04:06:50.349 --> 04:06:50.359 align:start position:0%
will be a just embraced by many
 
04:06:52.429 --> 04:06:52.439 align:start position:0%
organizations uh if you if a town
 
04:06:54.469 --> 04:06:54.479 align:start position:0%
chooses to adopt this so this cost the
 
04:06:56.389 --> 04:06:56.399 align:start position:0%
state absolutely nothing cost the state
 
04:06:58.189 --> 04:06:58.199 align:start position:0%
nothing in money cost the state nothing
 
04:06:59.630 --> 04:06:59.640 align:start position:0%
in trouble because the secretary of
 
04:07:02.110 --> 04:07:02.120 align:start position:0%
state is not involved in any municipal
 
04:07:05.110 --> 04:07:05.120 align:start position:0%
election um and because select boards
 
04:07:07.030 --> 04:07:07.040 align:start position:0%
and town councils city councils weigh in
 
04:07:09.469 --> 04:07:09.479 align:start position:0%
on ballot questions if there was some
 
04:07:12.149 --> 04:07:12.159 align:start position:0%
concern uh on the municipal level about
 
04:07:13.510 --> 04:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
adopting rank Choice voting that could
 
04:07:15.349 --> 04:07:15.359 align:start position:0%
could be communicated on the town
 
04:07:18.469 --> 04:07:18.479 align:start position:0%
warrant and voters are unlikely to go
 
04:07:19.830 --> 04:07:19.840 align:start position:0%
against those recommendations unless
 
04:07:22.990 --> 04:07:23.000 align:start position:0%
they have good cause so just to sum up
 
04:07:24.830 --> 04:07:24.840 align:start position:0%
this does not mandate anything it simply
 
04:07:27.590 --> 04:07:27.600 align:start position:0%
allows towns to do what the voters want
 
04:07:29.469 --> 04:07:29.479 align:start position:0%
whether they want to opt in opt out only
 
04:07:32.429 --> 04:07:32.439 align:start position:0%
for specific races um but enables the
 
04:07:34.429 --> 04:07:34.439 align:start position:0%
towns to save quite a bit of money time
 
04:07:36.510 --> 04:07:36.520 align:start position:0%
and trouble and increases voter
 
04:07:38.630 --> 04:07:38.640 align:start position:0%
participation and helps more candidates
 
04:07:41.710 --> 04:07:41.720 align:start position:0%
run and with that I am happy to take
 
04:07:43.590 --> 04:07:43.600 align:start position:0%
questions are there questions from the
 
04:07:44.950 --> 04:07:44.960 align:start position:0%
commit and I accidentally shut off your
 
04:07:46.070 --> 04:07:46.080 align:start position:0%
microphone I pressed the wrong button so
 
04:07:48.030 --> 04:07:48.040 align:start position:0%
you have to turn it back on yes sir
 
04:07:50.710 --> 04:07:50.720 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative Lane uh
 
04:07:53.910 --> 04:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um what
 
04:07:56.149 --> 04:07:56.159 align:start position:0%
about the current ballot counting
 
04:07:58.990 --> 04:07:59.000 align:start position:0%
machines can it handle this or would
 
04:08:01.710 --> 04:08:01.720 align:start position:0%
this require a whole new round of ballot
 
04:08:01.720 --> 04:08:02.670 align:start position:0%
this require a whole new round of ballot
counting

04:08:02.670 --> 04:08:02.680 align:start position:0%
counting
 
04:08:05.790 --> 04:08:05.800 align:start position:0%
machines so the current so it depends on
 
04:08:07.790 --> 04:08:07.800 align:start position:0%
what town adopts it the towns that have
 
04:08:10.309 --> 04:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
received new machines those machines are
 
04:08:13.149 --> 04:08:13.159 align:start position:0%
are CV ready so the new machines right
 
04:08:15.990 --> 04:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
but I and you would know better than me
 
04:08:17.790 --> 04:08:17.800 align:start position:0%
uh what is available to towns to help
 
04:08:20.349 --> 04:08:20.359 align:start position:0%
them adopt it if a town a hand count
 
04:08:22.149 --> 04:08:22.159 align:start position:0%
Town wanted to adopt this it's obviously
 
04:08:23.630 --> 04:08:23.640 align:start position:0%
something that the people of the town
 
04:08:25.429 --> 04:08:25.439 align:start position:0%
would consider before choosing to vote
 
04:08:28.550 --> 04:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
for it but again it's been done since
 
04:08:31.349 --> 04:08:31.359 align:start position:0%
the on the national level since
 
04:08:34.830 --> 04:08:34.840 align:start position:0%
1855 so um doing it by hand is not an
 
04:08:36.670 --> 04:08:36.680 align:start position:0%
issue it actually isn't that much more
 
04:08:39.269 --> 04:08:39.279 align:start position:0%
time than doing a first pass of the post
 
04:08:40.429 --> 04:08:40.439 align:start position:0%
election by
 
04:08:43.870 --> 04:08:43.880 align:start position:0%
hand further questions representative C
 
04:08:45.070 --> 04:08:45.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
04:08:47.990 --> 04:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh I didn't see in
 
04:08:53.030 --> 04:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
here any way of uh handling uh voting in
 
04:08:56.070 --> 04:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
multiple locations I'm thinking of uh
 
04:08:58.590 --> 04:08:58.600 align:start position:0%
for instance Manchester which has 12
 
04:09:00.790 --> 04:09:00.800 align:start position:0%
Wards 12 voting
 
04:09:04.349 --> 04:09:04.359 align:start position:0%
locations while each Ward only votes for
 
04:09:06.910 --> 04:09:06.920 align:start position:0%
one Ward counselor they all vote for
 
04:09:10.189 --> 04:09:10.199 align:start position:0%
mayor right how do you get the ballots
 
04:09:12.309 --> 04:09:12.319 align:start position:0%
or the information from the ballots from
 
04:09:14.189 --> 04:09:14.199 align:start position:0%
one place to another it's not mentioned
 
04:09:16.030 --> 04:09:16.040 align:start position:0%
in here right because it's up to the
 
04:09:17.870 --> 04:09:17.880 align:start position:0%
town how they want to centralize you do
 
04:09:19.990 --> 04:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
you raise a good point that you do in
 
04:09:21.630 --> 04:09:21.640 align:start position:0%
any rank Choice voting you have to
 
04:09:24.790 --> 04:09:24.800 align:start position:0%
centralize ballots or the number the the
 
04:09:27.550 --> 04:09:27.560 align:start position:0%
data so whether that's done as we
 
04:09:30.109 --> 04:09:30.119 align:start position:0%
currently do for example by couriering
 
04:09:32.790 --> 04:09:32.800 align:start position:0%
we currently Courier tape on for State
 
04:09:35.510 --> 04:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
elections Courier the tapes to the
 
04:09:37.109 --> 04:09:37.119 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office night of an
 
04:09:39.030 --> 04:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
election in a similar way you would have
 
04:09:41.670 --> 04:09:41.680 align:start position:0%
to Courier something or if the town
 
04:09:43.870 --> 04:09:43.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to somehow digitally transmit
 
04:09:45.349 --> 04:09:45.359 align:start position:0%
that that would be up to the town that
 
04:09:46.469 --> 04:09:46.479 align:start position:0%
would there would be a lot of concerns
 
04:09:49.429 --> 04:09:49.439 align:start position:0%
around digitally transmitting but um
 
04:09:50.830 --> 04:09:50.840 align:start position:0%
they could conceivably do that in some
 
04:09:52.710 --> 04:09:52.720 align:start position:0%
sort of secure way but you would have to
 
04:09:53.990 --> 04:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
centralize either if you're going to
 
04:09:55.870 --> 04:09:55.880 align:start position:0%
take all the ballots or take all the
 
04:09:57.750 --> 04:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
memory cards or what have you youd take
 
04:09:59.630 --> 04:09:59.640 align:start position:0%
it to one location and you'd run it all
 
04:10:01.670 --> 04:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
through the same
 
04:10:03.630 --> 04:10:03.640 align:start position:0%
reader further questions from the
 
04:10:06.030 --> 04:10:06.040 align:start position:0%
committee saying none thank you oh I'm
 
04:10:09.469 --> 04:10:09.479 align:start position:0%
sorry M Lane I apologize oh uh I did get
 
04:10:11.309 --> 04:10:11.319 align:start position:0%
a message that probably includes myself
 
04:10:12.469 --> 04:10:12.479 align:start position:0%
uh we need to speak more into the
 
04:10:14.550 --> 04:10:14.560 align:start position:0%
microphones I've got oh okay somebody
 
04:10:16.030 --> 04:10:16.040 align:start position:0%
watching at home is saying nobody can
 
04:10:18.550 --> 04:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
hear anybody asking
 
04:10:18.560 --> 04:10:20.189 align:start position:0%
hear anybody asking
questions

04:10:20.189 --> 04:10:20.199 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:10:23.309 --> 04:10:23.319 align:start position:0%
um how would this work and maybe this
 
04:10:26.309 --> 04:10:26.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen in a city but if you have
 
04:10:28.550 --> 04:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
multiple win like if you need more than
 
04:10:30.630 --> 04:10:30.640 align:start position:0%
one winner and I don't know if that
 
04:10:32.510 --> 04:10:32.520 align:start position:0%
happens in a city and whether that's
 
04:10:35.469 --> 04:10:35.479 align:start position:0%
just an academic conversation or right
 
04:10:38.870 --> 04:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
so multi-winner districts um is so when
 
04:10:40.309 --> 04:10:40.319 align:start position:0%
rank Choice vote this is actually a
 
04:10:42.229 --> 04:10:42.239 align:start position:0%
wonderful thing when rank Choice voting
 
04:10:44.910 --> 04:10:44.920 align:start position:0%
is applied to multi-member districts so
 
04:10:46.710 --> 04:10:46.720 align:start position:0%
that's something like for example my
 
04:10:48.149 --> 04:10:48.159 align:start position:0%
State Rep district has three
 
04:10:49.910 --> 04:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
Representatives representing and you're
 
04:10:54.349 --> 04:10:54.359 align:start position:0%
voting for three in that election when
 
04:10:56.030 --> 04:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
rank Choice voting is done in a
 
04:10:57.950 --> 04:10:57.960 align:start position:0%
multi-member district it's referred to
 
04:11:00.830 --> 04:11:00.840 align:start position:0%
as single transferable vote and the
 
04:11:01.870 --> 04:11:01.880 align:start position:0%
wonderful thing about single
 
04:11:03.750 --> 04:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
transferable vote combining multi-member
 
04:11:06.149 --> 04:11:06.159 align:start position:0%
districts with uh with rank Choice
 
04:11:08.590 --> 04:11:08.600 align:start position:0%
voting is the results end up
 
04:11:11.030 --> 04:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
proportional I actually spoke briefly on
 
04:11:13.349 --> 04:11:13.359 align:start position:0%
this when we were talking about the uh
 
04:11:17.990 --> 04:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
Open primary bill but um So currently
 
04:11:19.990 --> 04:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
let's say you have a district that's 60%
 
04:11:23.030 --> 04:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
one party 40% the other party um if you
 
04:11:25.590 --> 04:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
have three seats all three of those may
 
04:11:28.790 --> 04:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
go to the the one party that has 60%
 
04:11:31.109 --> 04:11:31.119 align:start position:0%
when proportionally you would want two
 
04:11:32.790 --> 04:11:32.800 align:start position:0%
of those seats and one of the seats to
 
04:11:35.710 --> 04:11:35.720 align:start position:0%
represent the other 40% and Naturally
 
04:11:39.109 --> 04:11:39.119 align:start position:0%
Speaking that's how um this turns out
 
04:11:41.149 --> 04:11:41.159 align:start position:0%
when you apply a single transferable
 
04:11:43.510 --> 04:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
vote to a multi-member district so so
 
04:11:44.990 --> 04:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
that's actually good now is in terms of
 
04:11:46.870 --> 04:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
whether I don't know for sure if any
 
04:11:49.429 --> 04:11:49.439 align:start position:0%
municipalities have a technical
 
04:11:50.990 --> 04:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
multi-member District you certainly have
 
04:11:52.550 --> 04:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
the opportunity like if you were voting
 
04:11:55.229 --> 04:11:55.239 align:start position:0%
for a Town Council either you're voting
 
04:11:57.910 --> 04:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
for specific seats with a term and you
 
04:11:59.990 --> 04:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
know different terms or you might be
 
04:12:02.109 --> 04:12:02.119 align:start position:0%
voting for like vote for three or
 
04:12:04.189 --> 04:12:04.199 align:start position:0%
whatever I presume it's up to the town
 
04:12:06.349 --> 04:12:06.359 align:start position:0%
in their
 
04:12:08.550 --> 04:12:08.560 align:start position:0%
Charter further questions from the
 
04:12:11.670 --> 04:12:11.680 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
04:12:13.790 --> 04:12:13.800 align:start position:0%
quae thank you
 
04:12:15.590 --> 04:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
uh you just used the term Single
 
04:12:18.070 --> 04:12:18.080 align:start position:0%
transferable vote is that defined in
 
04:12:24.149 --> 04:12:24.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:26.429 --> 04:12:26.439 align:start position:0%
actually and do realize that even though
 
04:12:28.269 --> 04:12:28.279 align:start position:0%
there's multiple pages to this bill it's
 
04:12:31.630 --> 04:12:31.640 align:start position:0%
all creating the concept of ranked
 
04:12:34.269 --> 04:12:34.279 align:start position:0%
Choice voting the actual enacting piece
 
04:12:38.189 --> 04:12:38.199 align:start position:0%
is um quite short it would probably yeah
 
04:12:41.030 --> 04:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:44.309 --> 04:12:44.319 align:start position:0%
undervote the lawyer in here may be able
 
04:12:46.269 --> 04:12:46.279 align:start position:0%
to answer
 
04:12:49.109 --> 04:12:49.119 align:start position:0%
better whether we use that actual term
 
04:12:51.870 --> 04:12:51.880 align:start position:0%
or whether we just def we just describe
 
04:12:58.870 --> 04:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:00.830 --> 04:13:00.840 align:start position:0%
conducted I will say that single
 
04:13:02.670 --> 04:13:02.680 align:start position:0%
transferable vote is currently is
 
04:13:04.229 --> 04:13:04.239 align:start position:0%
actually the city of Cambridge uses it
 
04:13:07.109 --> 04:13:07.119 align:start position:0%
to select their city council so it's
 
04:13:09.429 --> 04:13:09.439 align:start position:0%
been technically speaking there are
 
04:13:11.030 --> 04:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
several different flavors of single
 
04:13:13.950 --> 04:13:13.960 align:start position:0%
transferable vote and the type we use is
 
04:13:15.389 --> 04:13:15.399 align:start position:0%
the type that Scotland uses which is
 
04:13:17.710 --> 04:13:17.720 align:start position:0%
called the Scottish Scottish
 
04:13:20.109 --> 04:13:20.119 align:start position:0%
method thank you further questions from
 
04:13:23.750 --> 04:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
the committee representative Lane
 
04:13:27.070 --> 04:13:27.080 align:start position:0%
um because of the compressed amount of
 
04:13:29.750 --> 04:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
time if we wanted to understand this a
 
04:13:31.109 --> 04:13:31.119 align:start position:0%
little bit better is there a place you
 
04:13:34.229 --> 04:13:34.239 align:start position:0%
can point us to um so that we could get
 
04:13:36.030 --> 04:13:36.040 align:start position:0%
more information that you think is
 
04:13:38.550 --> 04:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
simple enough to make us understand it
 
04:13:41.510 --> 04:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
and other maybe our constituents so so
 
04:13:43.229 --> 04:13:43.239 align:start position:0%
you mean just the concept of ring Tre
 
04:13:46.590 --> 04:13:46.600 align:start position:0%
voting Fair vote is an amazing resource
 
04:13:49.910 --> 04:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
they've assisted multiple places in the
 
04:13:52.950 --> 04:13:52.960 align:start position:0%
country with um learning what rank
 
04:13:54.990 --> 04:13:55.000 align:start position:0%
Choice voting is and adopting it in
 
04:13:57.790 --> 04:13:57.800 align:start position:0%
education um Minnesota comes to mind as
 
04:14:01.469 --> 04:14:01.479 align:start position:0%
a city that that they've assisted but um
 
04:14:02.870 --> 04:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
certainly they've done it all over the
 
04:14:04.790 --> 04:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
country so fair vot's an excellent
 
04:14:06.309 --> 04:14:06.319 align:start position:0%
resource and of course we have our very
 
04:14:08.389 --> 04:14:08.399 align:start position:0%
own New Hampshire rank Choice voting
 
04:14:09.510 --> 04:14:09.520 align:start position:0%
which has a
 
04:14:11.630 --> 04:14:11.640 align:start position:0%
website further questions from the
 
04:14:16.830 --> 04:14:16.840 align:start position:0%
committee seeing thank you um next up is
 
04:14:19.349 --> 04:14:19.359 align:start position:0%
Steven Bourne um we've got a couple of
 
04:14:21.269 --> 04:14:21.279 align:start position:0%
cards here we're not too far behind on
 
04:14:22.910 --> 04:14:22.920 align:start position:0%
schedule um because I did do a little
 
04:14:24.389 --> 04:14:24.399 align:start position:0%
extra time with this uh but what I am
 
04:14:26.070 --> 04:14:26.080 align:start position:0%
going to ask as an Indulgence for
 
04:14:27.750 --> 04:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
members of the public please do not get
 
04:14:29.630 --> 04:14:29.640 align:start position:0%
up here and explain how rank Choice
 
04:14:31.149 --> 04:14:31.159 align:start position:0%
voting works the representatives get a
 
04:14:32.229 --> 04:14:32.239 align:start position:0%
very good job of it so we don't need to
 
04:14:33.910 --> 04:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
go through the mechanics of how it works
 
04:14:36.189 --> 04:14:36.199 align:start position:0%
of like the concept but if you have like
 
04:14:38.109 --> 04:14:38.119 align:start position:0%
why you like it or something specific
 
04:14:40.030 --> 04:14:40.040 align:start position:0%
about it but this has been a an issue
 
04:14:41.349 --> 04:14:41.359 align:start position:0%
with testimony on this bill in the past
 
04:14:42.670 --> 04:14:42.680 align:start position:0%
is members of the public will get up and
 
04:14:44.189 --> 04:14:44.199 align:start position:0%
just explain right choice voting again
 
04:14:45.429 --> 04:14:45.439 align:start position:0%
and again and again and again it's like
 
04:14:47.229 --> 04:14:47.239 align:start position:0%
so let's let's focus on what about it
 
04:14:50.229 --> 04:14:50.239 align:start position:0%
you like specifically um and I I assume
 
04:14:51.630 --> 04:14:51.640 align:start position:0%
at this point most of the members
 
04:14:53.189 --> 04:14:53.199 align:start position:0%
understand the mechanics of it in terms
 
04:14:55.710 --> 04:14:55.720 align:start position:0%
of the basically the immediate the
 
04:14:57.630 --> 04:14:57.640 align:start position:0%
immediate runoff system um so if you
 
04:14:59.710 --> 04:14:59.720 align:start position:0%
have questions like representative CAD
 
04:15:01.309 --> 04:15:01.319 align:start position:0%
about logistics St like that totally
 
04:15:03.870 --> 04:15:03.880 align:start position:0%
fair in in the game but as a as a matter
 
04:15:06.070 --> 04:15:06.080 align:start position:0%
of testimony let's let's try to con
 
04:15:07.830 --> 04:15:07.840 align:start position:0%
constrain it to why this is better and
 
04:15:10.830 --> 04:15:10.840 align:start position:0%
not how it works if that makes
 
04:15:13.510 --> 04:15:13.520 align:start position:0%
sense okay thank you stepen warrant from
 
04:15:15.790 --> 04:15:15.800 align:start position:0%
Ry and I'd like to share with you why
 
04:15:18.429 --> 04:15:18.439 align:start position:0%
I'd like the ability to have rank Choice
 
04:15:21.070 --> 04:15:21.080 align:start position:0%
voting in our community totally great so
 
04:15:22.590 --> 04:15:22.600 align:start position:0%
if you I assume you've all been
 
04:15:24.389 --> 04:15:24.399 align:start position:0%
struggling with the table I gave you
 
04:15:27.030 --> 04:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
last week and wondering what that 53%
 
04:15:29.550 --> 04:15:29.560 align:start position:0%
number represented and I assume you've
 
04:15:31.550 --> 04:15:31.560 align:start position:0%
all been staying up at night wondering
 
04:15:34.149 --> 04:15:34.159 align:start position:0%
why more than half the people that
 
04:15:37.229 --> 04:15:37.239 align:start position:0%
registered to vote in November at the
 
04:15:40.510 --> 04:15:40.520 align:start position:0%
polls registered Undeclared so more than
 
04:15:42.590 --> 04:15:42.600 align:start position:0%
half the people chose not to be
 
04:15:45.269 --> 04:15:45.279 align:start position:0%
registered registered as a Democrat or
 
04:15:47.469 --> 04:15:47.479 align:start position:0%
Republican and I'll give you you know
 
04:15:49.189 --> 04:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
what's happening in our community one of
 
04:15:52.469 --> 04:15:52.479 align:start position:0%
our friends was um was on the
 
04:15:54.550 --> 04:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
conservation as an alternate the
 
04:15:56.429 --> 04:15:56.439 align:start position:0%
committee had an open membership and he
 
04:15:59.070 --> 04:15:59.080 align:start position:0%
decided to stand up and be a full-time
 
04:16:02.469 --> 04:16:02.479 align:start position:0%
member he was attacked so viciously on
 
04:16:05.550 --> 04:16:05.560 align:start position:0%
Facebook that he dropped out and we're
 
04:16:08.070 --> 04:16:08.080 align:start position:0%
seeing more and more of this if you
 
04:16:09.910 --> 04:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
start driving around now you'll start to
 
04:16:12.269 --> 04:16:12.279 align:start position:0%
see them the March 11th campaign signs
 
04:16:15.510 --> 04:16:15.520 align:start position:0%
come up they come up in little packs so
 
04:16:18.630 --> 04:16:18.640 align:start position:0%
the house is either one of them or the
 
04:16:20.790 --> 04:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
house is one of them and what's
 
04:16:22.950 --> 04:16:22.960 align:start position:0%
happening for you got people like me and
 
04:16:25.229 --> 04:16:25.239 align:start position:0%
plenty of others 40% of the state
 
04:16:26.790 --> 04:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
neither of them
 
04:16:30.790 --> 04:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
represent how we feel and our voice all
 
04:16:35.670 --> 04:16:35.680 align:start position:0%
right so we've worked real hard in Ry to
 
04:16:38.149 --> 04:16:38.159 align:start position:0%
get voter turn out the local election up
 
04:16:41.109 --> 04:16:41.119 align:start position:0%
we've actually increased it by 50% we've
 
04:16:44.229 --> 04:16:44.239 align:start position:0%
gone from just under 20% at just over
 
04:16:47.229 --> 04:16:47.239 align:start position:0%
30% all right that still means about 70%
 
04:16:49.070 --> 04:16:49.080 align:start position:0%
of the people aren't voting it's still a
 
04:16:50.429 --> 04:16:50.439 align:start position:0%
lot better than what's happening in the
 
04:16:53.309 --> 04:16:53.319 align:start position:0%
state primary which is just over 20%
 
04:16:55.389 --> 04:16:55.399 align:start position:0%
move to September or June and maybe
 
04:16:56.950 --> 04:16:56.960 align:start position:0%
watch it drop down to
 
04:16:59.830 --> 04:16:59.840 align:start position:0%
15% all right one of the things that we
 
04:17:02.389 --> 04:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
should all be able to agree to and all
 
04:17:05.630 --> 04:17:05.640 align:start position:0%
work together is to address what I
 
04:17:07.070 --> 04:17:07.080 align:start position:0%
believe is the biggest problem it's a
 
04:17:09.550 --> 04:17:09.560 align:start position:0%
lack of participation and getting people
 
04:17:12.910 --> 04:17:12.920 align:start position:0%
to choose to spend more time either vote
 
04:17:15.349 --> 04:17:15.359 align:start position:0%
voting and participating especially at
 
04:17:17.269 --> 04:17:17.279 align:start position:0%
the local level all right we're
 
04:17:20.189 --> 04:17:20.199 align:start position:0%
struggling to get people to run now
 
04:17:22.830 --> 04:17:22.840 align:start position:0%
because they're so afraid of being
 
04:17:26.030 --> 04:17:26.040 align:start position:0%
associated with one side or the other
 
04:17:28.469 --> 04:17:28.479 align:start position:0%
all right and so we're hoping that this
 
04:17:30.429 --> 04:17:30.439 align:start position:0%
will give the opportunity that more
 
04:17:34.229 --> 04:17:34.239 align:start position:0%
people will step up now I've been filing
 
04:17:36.269 --> 04:17:36.279 align:start position:0%
online opposing and supporting the bills
 
04:17:37.189 --> 04:17:37.199 align:start position:0%
that have been in front of this
 
04:17:40.990 --> 04:17:41.000 align:start position:0%
committee most of them a lot of them are
 
04:17:43.990 --> 04:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
solutions searching for a problem others
 
04:17:46.830 --> 04:17:46.840 align:start position:0%
are things that are not going to make it
 
04:17:49.510 --> 04:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
easier for people to participate and
 
04:17:51.590 --> 04:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
that should be the thing that we all
 
04:17:54.269 --> 04:17:54.279 align:start position:0%
should be working on together everything
 
04:17:56.429 --> 04:17:56.439 align:start position:0%
that comes before this committee will it
 
04:17:58.590 --> 04:17:58.600 align:start position:0%
help get more people to turn out and
 
04:18:01.510 --> 04:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
vote more people to spend more of their
 
04:18:03.349 --> 04:18:03.359 align:start position:0%
time to pay attention to all of our
 
04:18:06.229 --> 04:18:06.239 align:start position:0%
government so what we're asking is
 
04:18:09.349 --> 04:18:09.359 align:start position:0%
please give us the freedom to have the
 
04:18:12.429 --> 04:18:12.439 align:start position:0%
option of having rank Choice voting in
 
04:18:15.309 --> 04:18:15.319 align:start position:0%
our Community we have the new tabulators
 
04:18:16.870 --> 04:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
I can't promise you it's going to get
 
04:18:19.030 --> 04:18:19.040 align:start position:0%
more people to turn out and participate
 
04:18:22.510 --> 04:18:22.520 align:start position:0%
but let's please try it
 
04:18:24.590 --> 04:18:24.600 align:start position:0%
questions questions from the
 
04:18:27.870 --> 04:18:27.880 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you um next
 
04:18:29.950 --> 04:18:29.960 align:start position:0%
up is
 
04:18:33.469 --> 04:18:33.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:38.910 --> 04:18:38.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:43.750 --> 04:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
all and then on Deck is Kathleen begging
 
04:18:45.870 --> 04:18:45.880 align:start position:0%
thank you chair um chair it's my first
 
04:18:49.670 --> 04:18:49.680 align:start position:0%
time so if there's any process that I we
 
04:18:51.830 --> 04:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
we are very kind and gentle go for it
 
04:18:55.189 --> 04:18:55.199 align:start position:0%
okay um so first what I introduce myself
 
04:18:56.590 --> 04:18:56.600 align:start position:0%
yep uh and pull that mic down just a
 
04:18:57.910 --> 04:18:57.920 align:start position:0%
little bit because people at home have
 
04:18:58.950 --> 04:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
everybody here in the room can hear you

04:19:04.950 --> 04:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
New
 
04:19:07.429 --> 04:19:07.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um across the country we see
 
04:19:09.309 --> 04:19:09.319 align:start position:0%
that candidates can ignore the will of
 
04:19:12.309 --> 04:19:12.319 align:start position:0%
most voters and still win elections
 
04:19:14.469 --> 04:19:14.479 align:start position:0%
politics is tearing our society apart
 
04:19:16.189 --> 04:19:16.199 align:start position:0%
because elections aren't working for
 
04:19:18.750 --> 04:19:18.760 align:start position:0%
most of us and many American voters are
 
04:19:21.229 --> 04:19:21.239 align:start position:0%
increasingly frustrated with partisan
 
04:19:24.389 --> 04:19:24.399 align:start position:0%
toxic politics rank Choice voting will
 
04:19:26.269 --> 04:19:26.279 align:start position:0%
promote less negative campaigning while
 
04:19:27.990 --> 04:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
giving voters access to candidates with
 
04:19:30.790 --> 04:19:30.800 align:start position:0%
a broader range of ideas let me tell you
 
04:19:33.670 --> 04:19:33.680 align:start position:0%
a personal story I participated in a
 
04:19:35.349 --> 04:19:35.359 align:start position:0%
town election where most voters
 
04:19:37.309 --> 04:19:37.319 align:start position:0%
preferred one of two highly qualified
 
04:19:39.189 --> 04:19:39.199 align:start position:0%
candidates were well-regarded members of
 
04:19:42.149 --> 04:19:42.159 align:start position:0%
the community most voters did not prefer
 
04:19:43.910 --> 04:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
the Third candidate who was running a
 
04:19:45.950 --> 04:19:45.960 align:start position:0%
divisive negative
 
04:19:48.590 --> 04:19:48.600 align:start position:0%
campaign sadly the third candidate ended
 
04:19:51.349 --> 04:19:51.359 align:start position:0%
up winning with only 34% of the total
 
04:19:54.309 --> 04:19:54.319 align:start position:0%
votes the other two candidates as I
 
04:19:55.870 --> 04:19:55.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned who were preferred by most
 
04:19:59.870 --> 04:19:59.880 align:start position:0%
voters lost due to due to split voting
 
04:20:02.670 --> 04:20:02.680 align:start position:0%
with each getting about 33% of the total
 
04:20:05.670 --> 04:20:05.680 align:start position:0%
votes so similar to many other elections
 
04:20:07.510 --> 04:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
the winner did not win as the choice of
 
04:20:11.030 --> 04:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
the absolute majority but one because of
 
04:20:13.670 --> 04:20:13.680 align:start position:0%
plurality in this town election the
 
04:20:15.510 --> 04:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
option for rank Choice voting would have
 
04:20:17.870 --> 04:20:17.880 align:start position:0%
given voters the freedom to select a
 
04:20:21.750 --> 04:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
backup choice hb600 as all of you know
 
04:20:23.790 --> 04:20:23.800 align:start position:0%
is only an enabling bill it will allow
 
04:20:26.070 --> 04:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
municipalities like mine to ask voters
 
04:20:27.510 --> 04:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
whether they want to opt in for our
 
04:20:30.469 --> 04:20:30.479 align:start position:0%
local Municipal elections our choice to
 
04:20:32.750 --> 04:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
optin would not affect any other
 
04:20:35.870 --> 04:20:35.880 align:start position:0%
municipality thank you okay and would
 
04:20:36.910 --> 04:20:36.920 align:start position:0%

I'm from bruntwood New Hampshire and I
 
04:21:03.670 --> 04:21:03.680 align:start position:0%
will be um very brief um again this is
 
04:21:06.710 --> 04:21:06.720 align:start position:0%
also my first time doing this so um I
 
04:21:08.950 --> 04:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
just want to you know give my support
 
04:21:12.590 --> 04:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
for um giving the towns the option to
 
04:21:15.950 --> 04:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
ADT rank Choice voting um it you know it
 
04:21:17.670 --> 04:21:17.680 align:start position:0%
promotes political competition and
 
04:21:20.349 --> 04:21:20.359 align:start position:0%
engagement across a diverse um spectrum
 
04:21:25.070 --> 04:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
of political beliefs
 
04:21:28.229 --> 04:21:28.239 align:start position:0%
um the bill supports um principle of
 
04:21:30.670 --> 04:21:30.680 align:start position:0%
local control and opt in and gives
 
04:21:32.149 --> 04:21:32.159 align:start position:0%
voters more
 
04:21:36.590 --> 04:21:36.600 align:start position:0%
choice and therefore more of a voice um
 
04:21:42.670 --> 04:21:42.680 align:start position:0%
in their elected officials um
 
04:21:45.229 --> 04:21:45.239 align:start position:0%
it does away with strategic voting where
 
04:21:48.109 --> 04:21:48.119 align:start position:0%
people are you know feeling like um they
 
04:21:51.790 --> 04:21:51.800 align:start position:0%
need to vote against a candidate um it
 
04:21:53.469 --> 04:21:53.479 align:start position:0%
lets voters vote their
 
04:21:53.479 --> 04:21:54.990 align:start position:0%
lets voters vote their
conscience

04:21:54.990 --> 04:21:55.000 align:start position:0%
conscience
 
04:21:57.910 --> 04:21:57.920 align:start position:0%
um it levels the playing field gives
 
04:22:00.910 --> 04:22:00.920 align:start position:0%
more people you know um an opportunity
 
04:22:06.710 --> 04:22:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:09.510 --> 04:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
um and it ures that voters are electing
 
04:22:12.309 --> 04:22:12.319 align:start position:0%
candidates with the most voter support
 
04:22:14.670 --> 04:22:14.680 align:start position:0%
as others have stated
 
04:22:17.349 --> 04:22:17.359 align:start position:0%
um because rank Choice voting opens up a
 
04:22:20.950 --> 04:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
greater competition of ideas um giving
 
04:22:23.269 --> 04:22:23.279 align:start position:0%
constitutes a deeper more nuanced
 
04:22:26.109 --> 04:22:26.119 align:start position:0%
expression of their real preferences um
 
04:22:28.349 --> 04:22:28.359 align:start position:0%
I would say politics aside that's
 
04:22:31.510 --> 04:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
something that we can all support thank
 
04:22:33.349 --> 04:22:33.359 align:start position:0%
you for letting me speak okay and would
 
04:22:34.590 --> 04:22:34.600 align:start position:0%

04:22:38.269 --> 04:22:38.279 align:start position:0%
questions um no thank
 
04:22:40.750 --> 04:22:40.760 align:start position:0%

bill by hundreds of New Hampshire
 
04:25:48.790 --> 04:25:48.800 align:start position:0%
citizens hb600 is a simple Pro Liberty
 
04:25:51.030 --> 04:25:51.040 align:start position:0%
Bill that should not be controversial
 
04:25:53.149 --> 04:25:53.159 align:start position:0%
and should have overwhelming near
 
04:25:55.670 --> 04:25:55.680 align:start position:0%
unanimous support it won't cost the
 
04:25:58.510 --> 04:25:58.520 align:start position:0%
state a dime it doesn't mandate anything
 
04:26:02.469 --> 04:26:02.479 align:start position:0%
on anyone hb600 simply enables local
 
04:26:04.870 --> 04:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
local municipalities to determine how to
 
04:26:06.910 --> 04:26:06.920 align:start position:0%
best meet their needs in their own local
 
04:26:09.389 --> 04:26:09.399 align:start position:0%
Municipal elections such as mayor
 
04:26:12.550 --> 04:26:12.560 align:start position:0%
council select board clerk moderator Etc
 
04:26:14.630 --> 04:26:14.640 align:start position:0%
the only thing this bill does is give
 
04:26:17.790 --> 04:26:17.800 align:start position:0%
towns and cities permission to have an
 
04:26:19.670 --> 04:26:19.680 align:start position:0%
RCV ballot
 
04:26:22.269 --> 04:26:22.279 align:start position:0%
measure if the bill passes nothing
 
04:26:25.469 --> 04:26:25.479 align:start position:0%
changes unless and until a town or city
 
04:26:27.790 --> 04:26:27.800 align:start position:0%
proposes and passes a warrant article or
 
04:26:30.670 --> 04:26:30.680 align:start position:0%
local ballot measure opting in to using
 
04:26:33.750 --> 04:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
RCV for Municipal elections only one
 
04:26:35.710 --> 04:26:35.720 align:start position:0%
town or city has no effect on another
 
04:26:38.510 --> 04:26:38.520 align:start position:0%
town or city small towns may not have a
 
04:26:40.910 --> 04:26:40.920 align:start position:0%
need for this but others do let's let
 
04:26:43.269 --> 04:26:43.279 align:start position:0%
towns decide some cities want to save
 
04:26:44.870 --> 04:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
money in their local elections by using
 
04:26:46.389 --> 04:26:46.399 align:start position:0%
rank Choice voting instead of runoff
 
04:26:48.510 --> 04:26:48.520 align:start position:0%
elections some towns would benefit from
 
04:26:50.429 --> 04:26:50.439 align:start position:0%
having more proportional represent
 
04:26:53.510 --> 04:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
representation and multi-winner races so
 
04:26:54.950 --> 04:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
that all people from the various
 
04:26:57.510 --> 04:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
factions in town feel
 
04:26:59.710 --> 04:26:59.720 align:start position:0%
represented I first learned about rank
 
04:27:02.790 --> 04:27:02.800 align:start position:0%
Choice voting in 2002 serving in the
 
04:27:05.189 --> 04:27:05.199 align:start position:0%
Republican party in Utah where we used
 
04:27:08.830 --> 04:27:08.840 align:start position:0%
RCV in convention for a 12 candidate us
 
04:27:11.030 --> 04:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
Congressional race and for an eight
 
04:27:14.429 --> 04:27:14.439 align:start position:0%
candidate gubernatorial race in 2004
 
04:27:17.189 --> 04:27:17.199 align:start position:0%
voters liked rank Choice liked ranking
 
04:27:19.389 --> 04:27:19.399 align:start position:0%
candidates and the candidates felt like
 
04:27:20.550 --> 04:27:20.560 align:start position:0%
it was
 
04:27:23.590 --> 04:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
fair Josh Daniels who I referred to he
 
04:27:25.469 --> 04:27:25.479 align:start position:0%
shows how easy the process was to
 
04:27:27.269 --> 04:27:27.279 align:start position:0%
implement and administer in
 
04:27:29.469 --> 04:27:29.479 align:start position:0%
municipalities in a county of about
 
04:27:32.590 --> 04:27:32.600 align:start position:0%
350,000 registered voters a very
 
04:27:35.349 --> 04:27:35.359 align:start position:0%
conservative County studies show that
 
04:27:38.229 --> 04:27:38.239 align:start position:0%
voters find arv easy to understand and
 
04:27:40.790 --> 04:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
use election results for rank Choice
 
04:27:42.870 --> 04:27:42.880 align:start position:0%
voting can be instant especially in a
 
04:27:45.030 --> 04:27:45.040 align:start position:0%
municipal election rank Choice voting
 
04:27:47.630 --> 04:27:47.640 align:start position:0%
has very low error rates can be handc
 
04:27:49.510 --> 04:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
counted is fully transparent and can be
 
04:27:52.389 --> 04:27:52.399 align:start position:0%
audited and recounted without incident
 
04:27:54.109 --> 04:27:54.119 align:start position:0%
the experience of County clerks all
 
04:27:55.510 --> 04:27:55.520 align:start position:0%
around the country where rank Choice
 
04:27:57.990 --> 04:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
voting has been implemented is similar
 
04:28:01.189 --> 04:28:01.199 align:start position:0%
to what Josh Daniels explains at first
 
04:28:03.429 --> 04:28:03.439 align:start position:0%
they're worried they don't want it they
 
04:28:04.830 --> 04:28:04.840 align:start position:0%
think it's going to be a disaster and
 
04:28:06.790 --> 04:28:06.800 align:start position:0%
then they always find out it's easy
 
04:28:09.269 --> 04:28:09.279 align:start position:0%
simple it runs without a hitch and then
 
04:28:10.910 --> 04:28:10.920 align:start position:0%
they become a big
 
04:28:13.790 --> 04:28:13.800 align:start position:0%
fan uh Salt Lake County has Salt Lake
 
04:28:16.349 --> 04:28:16.359 align:start position:0%
County also used rank Choice voting and
 
04:28:17.990 --> 04:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
they had instant results the night of
 
04:28:20.590 --> 04:28:20.600 align:start position:0%
the election as the as the results were
 
04:28:22.229 --> 04:28:22.239 align:start position:0%
coming in it automatically showed the
 
04:28:24.229 --> 04:28:24.239 align:start position:0%
results and not just like the final
 
04:28:27.030 --> 04:28:27.040 align:start position:0%
numbers but you can see the full results
 
04:28:28.910 --> 04:28:28.920 align:start position:0%
um exactly where the votes are going in
 
04:28:34.189 --> 04:28:34.199 align:start position:0%
each round it's really awesome um RCB
 
04:28:35.670 --> 04:28:35.680 align:start position:0%
we've already said it's reaching 51
 
04:28:37.189 --> 04:28:37.199 align:start position:0%
American jurisdictions it's home to
 
04:28:39.269 --> 04:28:39.279 align:start position:0%
nearly nearly 14 million voters in the
 
04:28:41.830 --> 04:28:41.840 align:start position:0%
US that includes two Statewide uses
 
04:28:45.389 --> 04:28:45.399 align:start position:0%
three countywide uses 46 Citywide uses
 
04:28:46.910 --> 04:28:46.920 align:start position:0%
that have already been used plus many
 
04:28:50.830 --> 04:28:50.840 align:start position:0%
more coming this year next year um
 
04:28:53.109 --> 04:28:53.119 align:start position:0%
military and overseas voters use it in
 
04:28:57.349 --> 04:28:57.359 align:start position:0%
Six States in one city um there there's
 
04:29:00.389 --> 04:29:00.399 align:start position:0%
no worry about voter and administrator
 
04:29:02.149 --> 04:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
education there are a lot of great
 
04:29:04.269 --> 04:29:04.279 align:start position:0%
groups out there that will fully educate
 
04:29:07.429 --> 04:29:07.439 align:start position:0%
for free the voters and the people who
 
04:29:09.510 --> 04:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
need to administer the elections it's
 
04:29:12.510 --> 04:29:12.520 align:start position:0%
very simple uh so rain choice voting is
 
04:29:14.429 --> 04:29:14.439 align:start position:0%
fully constitutional it's been tested in
 
04:29:17.670 --> 04:29:17.680 align:start position:0%
the courts it's been tested many places
 
04:29:20.070 --> 04:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
as I said in uh Deb Otis's testimony she
 
04:29:23.109 --> 04:29:23.119 align:start position:0%
talks about how big countries for years
 
04:29:24.790 --> 04:29:24.800 align:start position:0%
have been hand counting rank Choice
 
04:29:29.630 --> 04:29:29.640 align:start position:0%
voting it's very easy um it encourages
 
04:29:32.109 --> 04:29:32.119 align:start position:0%
competition healthy competition without
 
04:29:33.469 --> 04:29:33.479 align:start position:0%
the problem of vote splitting and it
 
04:29:36.070 --> 04:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
ensures that everyone's vote matters and
 
04:29:37.510 --> 04:29:37.520 align:start position:0%
that the candidate with the most support
 
04:29:40.429 --> 04:29:40.439 align:start position:0%
wins I'm happy to answer any questions
 
04:29:42.109 --> 04:29:42.119 align:start position:0%
about how rank Choice voting works or
 
04:29:44.070 --> 04:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
about election Administration or where
 
04:29:46.070 --> 04:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
it's used or the results of the exit
 
04:29:47.590 --> 04:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
polls and the studies that have been
 
04:29:50.750 --> 04:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
done okay other questions from the
 
04:29:53.790 --> 04:29:53.800 align:start position:0%
committee representative Lane thank you
 
04:29:56.790 --> 04:29:56.800 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
04:30:00.070 --> 04:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
um when you go beyond the first round
 
04:30:02.870 --> 04:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
can you explain like everybody can see
 
04:30:04.309 --> 04:30:04.319 align:start position:0%
those that's pretty
 
04:30:06.630 --> 04:30:06.640 align:start position:0%
transparent what happens when if you
 
04:30:08.950 --> 04:30:08.960 align:start position:0%
have to go to the second round I mean
 
04:30:12.229 --> 04:30:12.239 align:start position:0%
you said can you just is it transparent
 
04:30:15.229 --> 04:30:15.239 align:start position:0%
does it happen like in the voting box I
 
04:30:18.830 --> 04:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
mean what happens yes um the when the
 
04:30:20.189 --> 04:30:20.199 align:start position:0%
okay so there's different ways to do it
 
04:30:23.950 --> 04:30:23.960 align:start position:0%
once again the towns can decide uh which
 
04:30:25.349 --> 04:30:25.359 align:start position:0%
offices they're going to use it for and
 
04:30:27.710 --> 04:30:27.720 align:start position:0%
all of that so if you have a machine
 
04:30:30.030 --> 04:30:30.040 align:start position:0%
that is able to do it it will tabulate
 
04:30:35.510 --> 04:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
it um as as representative Reed said you
 
04:30:36.950 --> 04:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
do need to centralize it if you get to
 
04:30:38.070 --> 04:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
the rank Choice vote but you don't need
 
04:30:39.830 --> 04:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
to centralize it to start with you the
 
04:30:42.070 --> 04:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
machine runs the first count exactly the
 
04:30:44.109 --> 04:30:44.119 align:start position:0%
way the counts are used now and you
 
04:30:45.990 --> 04:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
often can get a winner just from those
 
04:30:48.389 --> 04:30:48.399 align:start position:0%
first counts um if you need to run the
 
04:30:50.229 --> 04:30:50.239 align:start position:0%
rounds then you do need to centralize
 
04:30:52.630 --> 04:30:52.640 align:start position:0%
all you do is centralize a little uh a
 
04:30:55.710 --> 04:30:55.720 align:start position:0%
little drive that's in the machine but
 
04:30:57.229 --> 04:30:57.239 align:start position:0%
the memory still stays with the machine
 
04:30:58.790 --> 04:30:58.800 align:start position:0%
and the ballot still stay in in the
 
04:31:00.870 --> 04:31:00.880 align:start position:0%
place where they started and then you
 
04:31:02.750 --> 04:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
centralize it to you just centralize it
 
04:31:05.030 --> 04:31:05.040 align:start position:0%
to the town clerk or the town moderator
 
04:31:07.389 --> 04:31:07.399 align:start position:0%
and you be you can run that drive
 
04:31:11.469 --> 04:31:11.479 align:start position:0%
through a software that is open source
 
04:31:13.630 --> 04:31:13.640 align:start position:0%
completely open you can see exactly
 
04:31:15.950 --> 04:31:15.960 align:start position:0%
what's happening and then it C it
 
04:31:18.389 --> 04:31:18.399 align:start position:0%
produces a cast vote record so you
 
04:31:20.030 --> 04:31:20.040 align:start position:0%
actually get a more complete picture of
 
04:31:21.349 --> 04:31:21.359 align:start position:0%
what has happened in the election than
 
04:31:24.309 --> 04:31:24.319 align:start position:0%
we do now um it's not it's obviously of
 
04:31:25.790 --> 04:31:25.800 align:start position:0%
course Anonymous you don't know who
 
04:31:28.149 --> 04:31:28.159 align:start position:0%
voted how but you do know how every
 
04:31:31.309 --> 04:31:31.319 align:start position:0%
voter cast their their rankings and you
 
04:31:34.109 --> 04:31:34.119 align:start position:0%
can see exactly how the rankings worked
 
04:31:36.149 --> 04:31:36.159 align:start position:0%
and you know during your break we will
 
04:31:37.910 --> 04:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
we can do a chocolate election with the
 
04:31:40.269 --> 04:31:40.279 align:start position:0%
ballot that you have and and tabulate it
 
04:31:41.349 --> 04:31:41.359 align:start position:0%
right here in front of you and you can
 
04:31:43.710 --> 04:31:43.720 align:start position:0%
see how how it works in each
 
04:31:46.670 --> 04:31:46.680 align:start position:0%
round okay okay further questions from
 
04:31:46.680 --> 04:31:47.269 align:start position:0%
round okay okay further questions from
the

04:31:47.269 --> 04:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:31:50.550 --> 04:31:50.560 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you um next
 
04:32:03.349 --> 04:32:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:05.510 --> 04:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
estadio thank you chairman brry and
 
04:32:07.429 --> 04:32:07.439 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
04:32:09.590 --> 04:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
my name is Kaye of stadio I am a public
 
04:32:12.149 --> 04:32:12.159 align:start position:0%
policy fellow with open democracy and a
 
04:32:14.630 --> 04:32:14.640 align:start position:0%
voter I just have um very brief
 
04:32:17.109 --> 04:32:17.119 align:start position:0%
testimony to read today from Karen Dodge
 
04:32:18.349 --> 04:32:18.359 align:start position:0%
of Derry New
 
04:32:20.870 --> 04:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um she says as a New Hampshire
 
04:32:22.750 --> 04:32:22.760 align:start position:0%
constituent and voter I am asking you to
 
04:32:22.760 --> 04:32:23.710 align:start position:0%
constituent and voter I am asking you to
support

04:32:23.710 --> 04:32:23.720 align:start position:0%
support
 
04:32:26.269 --> 04:32:26.279 align:start position:0%
hb600 as you know this bill does not
 
04:32:28.269 --> 04:32:28.279 align:start position:0%
require any New Hampshire city or town
 
04:32:30.870 --> 04:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
to adopt a ring Choice voting system but
 
04:32:32.429 --> 04:32:32.439 align:start position:0%
rather enables the citizens of New
 
04:32:34.229 --> 04:32:34.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire municipalities to use the
 
04:32:36.309 --> 04:32:36.319 align:start position:0%
system for local elections if they so
 
04:32:38.429 --> 04:32:38.439 align:start position:0%
choose if you believe that local
 
04:32:39.950 --> 04:32:39.960 align:start position:0%
elections should be run by local
 
04:32:41.309 --> 04:32:41.319 align:start position:0%
government with the approval of the
 
04:32:43.229 --> 04:32:43.239 align:start position:0%
secretary of State you should not be
 
04:32:45.750 --> 04:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
afraid to vote in support of this bill
 
04:32:47.349 --> 04:32:47.359 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that ring Choice
 
04:32:49.109 --> 04:32:49.119 align:start position:0%
voting serves to encourage increased
 
04:32:51.269 --> 04:32:51.279 align:start position:0%
voter participation as Citizens start to
 
04:32:53.349 --> 04:32:53.359 align:start position:0%
realize that their vote does count and
 
04:32:55.229 --> 04:32:55.239 align:start position:0%
to discourage negative campaigning by
 
04:32:56.790 --> 04:32:56.800 align:start position:0%
candidates in the hopes of gaining
 
04:32:59.429 --> 04:32:59.439 align:start position:0%
secondary Choice status from voters the
 
04:33:00.870 --> 04:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
most important reason that I support
 
04:33:02.750 --> 04:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
rank Choice voting is that the winner of
 
04:33:04.269 --> 04:33:04.279 align:start position:0%
Elections has the support of the
 
04:33:07.070 --> 04:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
majority of Voters this is a nonpartisan
 
04:33:09.750 --> 04:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
Bill and has bipartisan support please
 
04:33:09.760 --> 04:33:10.750 align:start position:0%

04:33:44.070 --> 04:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
um 60 2 American jurisdictions and over
 
04:33:48.109 --> 04:33:48.119 align:start position:0%
3 million voters in this country um two
 
04:33:52.029 --> 04:33:52.039 align:start position:0%
states two counties and 58 cities or
 
04:33:55.510 --> 04:33:55.520 align:start position:0%
Municipal elections um and overseas and
 
04:33:57.869 --> 04:33:57.879 align:start position:0%
Military voters use rank Choice voting
 
04:34:00.390 --> 04:34:00.400 align:start position:0%
in Six States Cambridge Massachusetts
 
04:34:02.670 --> 04:34:02.680 align:start position:0%
has used rank Choice voting since
 
04:34:05.470 --> 04:34:05.480 align:start position:0%
1941 successfully for their city council
 
04:34:07.670 --> 04:34:07.680 align:start position:0%
and their school committees uh rank
 
04:34:10.230 --> 04:34:10.240 align:start position:0%
Choice voting is very nonpartisan it
 
04:34:12.429 --> 04:34:12.439 align:start position:0%
gives voters more choices and a greater
 
04:34:15.230 --> 04:34:15.240 align:start position:0%
voice at the poll under this system you
 
04:34:18.869 --> 04:34:18.879 align:start position:0%
rank your preferences um and it's it's
 
04:34:21.390 --> 04:34:21.400 align:start position:0%
really a voids candidates people who
 
04:34:23.869 --> 04:34:23.879 align:start position:0%
vote for the you know I don't like this
 
04:34:25.070 --> 04:34:25.080 align:start position:0%
guy so I'm going to vote for the other
 
04:34:26.830 --> 04:34:26.840 align:start position:0%
person and a lot of Voters go to the
 
04:34:29.470 --> 04:34:29.480 align:start position:0%
poll and vote vote that way um I'll just
 
04:34:32.869 --> 04:34:32.879 align:start position:0%
and it also um is a solution to voter a
 
04:34:35.429 --> 04:34:35.439 align:start position:0%
apathy um I'll just tell one quick story
 
04:34:36.789 --> 04:34:36.799 align:start position:0%
with the first time I ran for City
 
04:34:38.470 --> 04:34:38.480 align:start position:0%
Council in the city of Franklin there
 
04:34:40.869 --> 04:34:40.879 align:start position:0%
were three candidates for city council I
 
04:34:43.510 --> 04:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
think I won because the other you know
 
04:34:45.390 --> 04:34:45.400 align:start position:0%
the other two got more votes than I did
 
04:34:48.869 --> 04:34:48.879 align:start position:0%
but I won by 17 votes because I was the
 
04:34:50.230 --> 04:34:50.240 align:start position:0%
top vote
 
04:34:53.830 --> 04:34:53.840 align:start position:0%
getter um rank Choice voting does
 
04:34:53.840 --> 04:34:55.029 align:start position:0%
getter um rank Choice voting does
decrease

04:34:55.029 --> 04:34:55.039 align:start position:0%
decrease
 
04:34:57.709 --> 04:34:57.719 align:start position:0%
polarization um because when you're
 
04:35:00.230 --> 04:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
talking to voters maybe you're not their
 
04:35:01.869 --> 04:35:01.879 align:start position:0%
first choice but you could say could I
 
04:35:03.910 --> 04:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
be your second choice and you could
 
04:35:05.949 --> 04:35:05.959 align:start position:0%
gives you a chance to introduce yourself
 
04:35:09.109 --> 04:35:09.119 align:start position:0%
and also uh less confrontational and
 
04:35:12.910 --> 04:35:12.920 align:start position:0%
less negative at uh Campa aing um I'm
 
04:35:14.910 --> 04:35:14.920 align:start position:0%
sure you've heard uh lots of Voters that
 
04:35:17.070 --> 04:35:17.080 align:start position:0%
are sick and tired of negative ads
 
04:35:19.510 --> 04:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
during campaign season and rank Choice
 
04:35:21.349 --> 04:35:21.359 align:start position:0%
voting does result in more positive
 
04:35:23.150 --> 04:35:23.160 align:start position:0%
campaigns in the jurisdictions where
 
04:35:27.390 --> 04:35:27.400 align:start position:0%
it's used um rank Choice voting um is
 
04:35:30.789 --> 04:35:30.799 align:start position:0%
possible for you to pick you know two
 
04:35:34.070 --> 04:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
Republicans or or the Democrat and and
 
04:35:37.349 --> 04:35:37.359 align:start position:0%
rank the other candidates most of the
 
04:35:38.990 --> 04:35:39.000 align:start position:0%
local elections are
 
04:35:41.750 --> 04:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan um
 
04:35:43.789 --> 04:35:43.799 align:start position:0%
and I think it this also just is a
 
04:35:46.189 --> 04:35:46.199 align:start position:0%
opt-in and allows local communities to
 
04:35:49.590 --> 04:35:49.600 align:start position:0%
do this and it also will give voters um
 
04:35:51.990 --> 04:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
more confidence in their elections thank
 
04:35:54.510 --> 04:35:54.520 align:start position:0%
you for your time and I won't take
 
04:35:57.789 --> 04:35:57.799 align:start position:0%
questions it's great it's great day okay
 
04:36:03.789 --> 04:36:03.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:07.310 --> 04:36:07.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:10.070 --> 04:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
it thank you for recognizing me again Mr
 
04:36:11.590 --> 04:36:11.600 align:start position:0%
chair the question that was asked
 
04:36:14.109 --> 04:36:14.119 align:start position:0%
earlier was is single transferable vote
 
04:36:15.709 --> 04:36:15.719 align:start position:0%
mentioned I think in a previous
 
04:36:17.189 --> 04:36:17.199 align:start position:0%
iteration of the bill this is like my
 
04:36:20.390 --> 04:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
10th version of this bill um we did but
 
04:36:23.510 --> 04:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
in this version it is only described not
 
04:36:27.670 --> 04:36:27.680 align:start position:0%
named uh on page four lines 17 through
 
04:36:30.869 --> 04:36:30.879 align:start position:0%
27 that paragraph that's labeled B
 
04:36:34.470 --> 04:36:34.480 align:start position:0%
lowercase B that paragraph describes the
 
04:36:36.789 --> 04:36:36.799 align:start position:0%
method of Scottish version of single
 
04:36:41.750 --> 04:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
transferable vote page 4 17- 27 and with
 
04:36:43.150 --> 04:36:43.160 align:start position:0%
that I'll end I'll just say rank Choice
 
04:36:44.709 --> 04:36:44.719 align:start position:0%
voting is the highest definition picture
 
04:36:46.789 --> 04:36:46.799 align:start position:0%
of the will of the
 
04:36:49.029 --> 04:36:49.039 align:start position:0%
electorate okay and with that we will
 
04:36:51.230 --> 04:36:51.240 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing for House Bill
 
04:36:54.470 --> 04:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
600 uh on the blue sheet was five in
 
04:36:57.670 --> 04:36:57.680 align:start position:0%
support zero opposed online with 664 in
 
04:37:01.349 --> 04:37:01.359 align:start position:0%
support 33 opposed and zero neutral uh
 
04:37:04.269 --> 04:37:04.279 align:start position:0%
with that we will open the executive
 
04:37:07.470 --> 04:37:07.480 align:start position:0%
executive whoa uh the public hearing of
 
04:37:10.629 --> 04:37:10.639 align:start position:0%
House Bill 412 relative to elections and
 
04:37:12.949 --> 04:37:12.959 align:start position:0%
appointments to fill vacancies of local
 
04:37:15.429 --> 04:37:15.439 align:start position:0%
Cooperative school districts and
 
04:37:17.390 --> 04:37:17.400 align:start position:0%
representative SP I was say I knew I saw
 
04:37:18.629 --> 04:37:18.639 align:start position:0%
you on the bill but I didn't see your
 
04:37:21.390 --> 04:37:21.400 align:start position:0%
card there we go uh we'll recognize Rec
 
04:37:22.949 --> 04:37:22.959 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury for the
 
04:37:27.510 --> 04:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:29.551 --> 04:37:29.561 align:start position:0%
introduction thank you very much Mr
 
04:37:31.789 --> 04:37:31.799 align:start position:0%
chairman um my first visit with the
 
04:37:33.230 --> 04:37:33.240 align:start position:0%
election law
 
04:37:37.990 --> 04:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
committee so this bill 412 has two
 
04:37:41.029 --> 04:37:41.039 align:start position:0%
purposes Associated to each other by
 
04:37:42.510 --> 04:37:42.520 align:start position:0%
virtue of the fact that both of them
 
04:37:45.269 --> 04:37:45.279 align:start position:0%
deal with the composition of a school
 
04:37:47.789 --> 04:37:47.799 align:start position:0%
board in a Cooperative School
 
04:37:50.869 --> 04:37:50.879 align:start position:0%
District uh these proposals were in
 
04:37:53.150 --> 04:37:53.160 align:start position:0%
bills that last year went to the
 
04:37:56.429 --> 04:37:56.439 align:start position:0%
education committee went to interim
 
04:37:59.629 --> 04:37:59.639 align:start position:0%
study and uh were recommended for future
 
04:38:02.510 --> 04:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
legislation in the education committee
 
04:38:02.520 --> 04:38:03.590 align:start position:0%
legislation in the education committee
last

04:38:03.590 --> 04:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
last
 
04:38:06.709 --> 04:38:06.719 align:start position:0%
fall what they do is very simple the
 
04:38:08.429 --> 04:38:08.439 align:start position:0%
explanation of why they're needed
 
04:38:11.551 --> 04:38:11.561 align:start position:0%
perhaps take a little bit more time
 
04:38:15.551 --> 04:38:15.561 align:start position:0%
first you'll see on line 16 and
 
04:38:20.109 --> 04:38:20.119 align:start position:0%
17 that if a district has made the
 
04:38:23.551 --> 04:38:23.561 align:start position:0%
decision to allocate seats on the school
 
04:38:27.551 --> 04:38:27.561 align:start position:0%
board by town or by prior
 
04:38:30.551 --> 04:38:30.561 align:start position:0%
District this is saying that they have
 
04:38:34.551 --> 04:38:34.561 align:start position:0%
to be elected exclusively within their
 
04:38:34.561 --> 04:38:37.189 align:start position:0%
to be elected exclusively within their
own

04:38:37.189 --> 04:38:37.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:41.429 --> 04:38:41.439 align:start position:0%
District so for example I represent uh
 
04:38:44.750 --> 04:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
Charlestown Unity Newport Newport has
 
04:38:47.990 --> 04:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
its own School District simple no
 
04:38:50.429 --> 04:38:50.439 align:start position:0%
problems Charles toown is a member of
 
04:38:51.910 --> 04:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
the Fall Mountain Regional School
 
04:38:53.830 --> 04:38:53.840 align:start position:0%
District Five
 
04:38:57.629 --> 04:38:57.639 align:start position:0%
Towns seven member School Board two
 
04:39:01.629 --> 04:39:01.639 align:start position:0%
seats at large one allocated to each
 
04:39:03.189 --> 04:39:03.199 align:start position:0%
Town each prior
 
04:39:06.670 --> 04:39:06.680 align:start position:0%
District there's um quite a dispersion
 
04:39:09.189 --> 04:39:09.199 align:start position:0%
of student population amongst those
 
04:39:13.029 --> 04:39:13.039 align:start position:0%
towns Charlestown has 46% % wall pole
 
04:39:14.429 --> 04:39:14.439 align:start position:0%
about 30
 
04:39:17.510 --> 04:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
32% and then three towns together make
 
04:39:19.910 --> 04:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
up the balance two of which are
 
04:39:24.109 --> 04:39:24.119 align:start position:0%
extremely small but each Town gets one
 
04:39:28.269 --> 04:39:28.279 align:start position:0%
seat and in Fall Mountain district and
 
04:39:30.310 --> 04:39:30.320 align:start position:0%
I've learned uh since developing this
 
04:39:34.789 --> 04:39:34.799 align:start position:0%
bill uh in in many other districts the
 
04:39:38.590 --> 04:39:38.600 align:start position:0%
uh Charles Town seat is elected by all
 
04:39:40.990 --> 04:39:41.000 align:start position:0%
the voters of the district all five
 
04:39:41.000 --> 04:39:42.470 align:start position:0%
the voters of the district all five
towns

04:39:42.470 --> 04:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
towns
 
04:39:46.430 --> 04:39:46.440 align:start position:0%
the little tiny towns aworth or langon
 
04:39:48.510 --> 04:39:48.520 align:start position:0%
have their member elected from the
 
04:39:51.070 --> 04:39:51.080 align:start position:0%
entire District that creates some very
 
04:39:53.390 --> 04:39:53.400 align:start position:0%
anomalous results essentially the larger
 
04:39:55.270 --> 04:39:55.280 align:start position:0%
towns can tell the smaller towns who
 
04:39:57.670 --> 04:39:57.680 align:start position:0%
their their representative is going to
 
04:40:00.070 --> 04:40:00.080 align:start position:0%
be but even in the case of Charlestown
 
04:40:02.230 --> 04:40:02.240 align:start position:0%
several times in the last half dozen
 
04:40:05.510 --> 04:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
years the uh voters of Charlestown in a
 
04:40:09.110 --> 04:40:09.120 align:start position:0%
contested election choose candidate a
 
04:40:11.628 --> 04:40:11.638 align:start position:0%
and the other four towns represent sing
 
04:40:15.230 --> 04:40:15.240 align:start position:0%
5% of the AG 55% of the aggregate vote
 
04:40:18.190 --> 04:40:18.200 align:start position:0%
select somebody different so I I think
 
04:40:20.670 --> 04:40:20.680 align:start position:0%
the the first part of the bill is simply
 
04:40:25.628 --> 04:40:25.638 align:start position:0%
to ensure that the town gets the town's
 
04:40:27.270 --> 04:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
voters get to choose their own
 
04:40:29.270 --> 04:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
representative and not have that outcome
 
04:40:32.550 --> 04:40:32.560 align:start position:0%
driven by the other towns in the
 
04:40:35.510 --> 04:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
district the second part of the bill
 
04:40:38.788 --> 04:40:38.798 align:start position:0%
which you'll find on lines 26 to
 
04:40:41.628 --> 04:40:41.638 align:start position:0%
28 uh is a little more nuanced in and
 
04:40:44.190 --> 04:40:44.200 align:start position:0%
what that says is that in a Cooperative
 
04:40:47.470 --> 04:40:47.480 align:start position:0%
School District that has outlar
 
04:40:50.910 --> 04:40:50.920 align:start position:0%
seats when a member holding an atlarge
 
04:40:54.628 --> 04:40:54.638 align:start position:0%
seat resigns midterm and the vacancy is
 
04:40:56.990 --> 04:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
to be filled which I understand
 
04:40:58.350 --> 04:40:58.360 align:start position:0%
generally it's certainly true in Fall
 
04:41:01.948 --> 04:41:01.958 align:start position:0%
Mountain is is filled by the remaining
 
04:41:04.390 --> 04:41:04.400 align:start position:0%
members of the school
 
04:41:08.830 --> 04:41:08.840 align:start position:0%
board this amendment says that the
 
04:41:10.948 --> 04:41:10.958 align:start position:0%
candidates that they can choose from and
 
04:41:13.230 --> 04:41:13.240 align:start position:0%
the candidate they appoint has to come
 
04:41:18.310 --> 04:41:18.320 align:start position:0%
from the same town as the doile of the
 
04:41:20.708 --> 04:41:20.718 align:start position:0%
um of the member who has just resigned
 
04:41:23.830 --> 04:41:23.840 align:start position:0%
who whose position is being filled the
 
04:41:27.390 --> 04:41:27.400 align:start position:0%
purpose of that is again to maintain the
 
04:41:30.590 --> 04:41:30.600 align:start position:0%
dynamic balance of a board so where you
 
04:41:32.550 --> 04:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
have a board again using using Fall
 
04:41:34.708 --> 04:41:34.718 align:start position:0%
Mountain as an example where every every
 
04:41:38.230 --> 04:41:38.240 align:start position:0%
town regardless of its size is uh is
 
04:41:39.470 --> 04:41:39.480 align:start position:0%
assigned one
 
04:41:42.948 --> 04:41:42.958 align:start position:0%
seat the importance of the outlar seats
 
04:41:46.190 --> 04:41:46.200 align:start position:0%
is that they tend to maintain a a
 
04:41:49.670 --> 04:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
balance and typically uh the Electoral
 
04:41:52.070 --> 04:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
Dynamics in that District are that one
 
04:41:54.230 --> 04:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
atlarge seat is held by a Charlestown
 
04:41:55.948 --> 04:41:55.958 align:start position:0%
representative and one by a Walpole
 
04:41:59.110 --> 04:41:59.120 align:start position:0%
representative and that at least does a
 
04:41:59.120 --> 04:42:00.750 align:start position:0%
representative and that at least does a
partial

04:42:00.750 --> 04:42:00.760 align:start position:0%
partial
 
04:42:03.190 --> 04:42:03.200 align:start position:0%
rebalancing but when one of those
 
04:42:05.150 --> 04:42:05.160 align:start position:0%
atlarge members
 
04:42:07.550 --> 04:42:07.560 align:start position:0%
resigns the remaining school board
 
04:42:10.390 --> 04:42:10.400 align:start position:0%
members who are predominantly from other
 
04:42:10.400 --> 04:42:11.670 align:start position:0%
members who are predominantly from other
towns

04:42:11.670 --> 04:42:11.680 align:start position:0%
towns
 
04:42:15.350 --> 04:42:15.360 align:start position:0%
um I have found empirically often are
 
04:42:19.310 --> 04:42:19.320 align:start position:0%
tempted to appoint uh whoever they're
 
04:42:22.390 --> 04:42:22.400 align:start position:0%
you know closest comrade is and that's
 
04:42:24.628 --> 04:42:24.638 align:start position:0%
often somebody who was defeated in a
 
04:42:26.830 --> 04:42:26.840 align:start position:0%
prior election there have been all kinds
 
04:42:30.030 --> 04:42:30.040 align:start position:0%
of weird efforts to shift the balance
 
04:42:33.190 --> 04:42:33.200 align:start position:0%
away from the town that has the dominant
 
04:42:37.030 --> 04:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
population uh towards uh others so uh
 
04:42:39.150 --> 04:42:39.160 align:start position:0%
two different bills uh that have been
 
04:42:42.110 --> 04:42:42.120 align:start position:0%
combined into one if you have uh
 
04:42:45.150 --> 04:42:45.160 align:start position:0%
reservations um I am happy to help
 
04:42:47.830 --> 04:42:47.840 align:start position:0%
fashion an amendment if you decide that
 
04:42:49.470 --> 04:42:49.480 align:start position:0%
you like one of these proposals and
 
04:42:51.510 --> 04:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
you're uncomfortable with the other
 
04:42:54.708 --> 04:42:54.718 align:start position:0%
please split them and uh Advance the one
 
04:42:57.390 --> 04:42:57.400 align:start position:0%
that you uh ear in consensus on I'm glad
 
04:42:58.708 --> 04:42:58.718 align:start position:0%
to take any questions all right are
 
04:43:00.430 --> 04:43:00.440 align:start position:0%
there questions from the committee
 
04:43:00.440 --> 04:43:02.350 align:start position:0%
there questions from the committee
representative

04:43:02.350 --> 04:43:02.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:43:04.830 --> 04:43:04.840 align:start position:0%
Lane thank you for taking my question
 
04:43:06.430 --> 04:43:06.440 align:start position:0%
this is something that's a little out of
 
04:43:09.510 --> 04:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
our realm you know so
 
04:43:12.070 --> 04:43:12.080 align:start position:0%
U I think the educ ation policy and
 
04:43:13.868 --> 04:43:13.878 align:start position:0%
administration committee was surprised
 
04:43:15.708 --> 04:43:15.718 align:start position:0%
that it didn't go to them but you're the
 
04:43:17.708 --> 04:43:17.718 align:start position:0%
lucky one Municipal in County you know
 
04:43:21.708 --> 04:43:21.718 align:start position:0%
who knows um it it seems to me that if
 
04:43:23.590 --> 04:43:23.600 align:start position:0%
you're giving the smallest town I think
 
04:43:26.550 --> 04:43:26.560 align:start position:0%
you mentioned aworth the same
 
04:43:29.628 --> 04:43:29.638 align:start position:0%
number the same voice that you're giving
 
04:43:31.750 --> 04:43:31.760 align:start position:0%
Charlestown which has
 
04:43:35.310 --> 04:43:35.320 align:start position:0%
46% that seems a bit disproportional to
 
04:43:39.030 --> 04:43:39.040 align:start position:0%
me in making decisions if they are I'm
 
04:43:42.390 --> 04:43:42.400 align:start position:0%
assuming not putting in as much money
 
04:43:44.590 --> 04:43:44.600 align:start position:0%
and they don't have as many students but
 
04:43:47.510 --> 04:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
yet they're they're getting more of a
 
04:43:50.390 --> 04:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
voice than perhaps well I would agree
 
04:43:52.788 --> 04:43:52.798 align:start position:0%
with you and in in that example aworth
 
04:43:54.628 --> 04:43:54.638 align:start position:0%
which has about seven or eight% of the
 
04:43:57.110 --> 04:43:57.120 align:start position:0%
students has the same uh voice as
 
04:44:00.190 --> 04:44:00.200 align:start position:0%
Charles down with 46 these are historic
 
04:44:02.750 --> 04:44:02.760 align:start position:0%
anomalies that have derived from the
 
04:44:04.788 --> 04:44:04.798 align:start position:0%
formation of districts in the case of
 
04:44:06.270 --> 04:44:06.280 align:start position:0%
Fall Mountain
 
04:44:08.430 --> 04:44:08.440 align:start position:0%
1966 that was part of the bargain of
 
04:44:12.230 --> 04:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
bringing the communities together and um
 
04:44:14.750 --> 04:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
I think it would be an interesting topic
 
04:44:16.910 --> 04:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
to completely reexamine that but it is
 
04:44:18.628 --> 04:44:18.638 align:start position:0%
also a function of the Articles of
 
04:44:21.470 --> 04:44:21.480 align:start position:0%
agreement and what I'm trying to do is
 
04:44:27.628 --> 04:44:27.638 align:start position:0%
accept that history but temper the worst
 
04:44:29.590 --> 04:44:29.600 align:start position:0%
Temptations for the guest representative
 
04:44:29.600 --> 04:44:30.788 align:start position:0%
Temptations for the guest representative
Lane

04:44:30.788 --> 04:44:30.798 align:start position:0%
Lane
 
04:44:33.190 --> 04:44:33.200 align:start position:0%
followup again thank
 
04:44:33.200 --> 04:44:37.750 align:start position:0%
followup again thank
you

04:44:37.750 --> 04:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:41.190 --> 04:44:41.200 align:start position:0%
um I I'll never mind
 
04:44:42.230 --> 04:44:42.240 align:start position:0%
all right further questions from the
 
04:44:43.910 --> 04:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
committee seeing n thank you
 
04:44:45.070 --> 04:44:45.080 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury only have one
 
04:45:03.868 --> 04:45:03.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:06.230 --> 04:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
Horan I'm representing Timothy Horan
 
04:45:07.948 --> 04:45:07.958 align:start position:0%
straford County District 10 which is the
 
04:45:11.030 --> 04:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
town of Durham which not and I mention
 
04:45:13.150 --> 04:45:13.160 align:start position:0%
before that's the largest town in the
 
04:45:16.230 --> 04:45:16.240 align:start position:0%
Oyster River Cooperative School District
 
04:45:19.708 --> 04:45:19.718 align:start position:0%
so um we have I think roughly two-thirds
 
04:45:21.788 --> 04:45:21.798 align:start position:0%
of the population and
 
04:45:25.030 --> 04:45:25.040 align:start position:0%
although Lee and Madbury both are well
 
04:45:26.830 --> 04:45:26.840 align:start position:0%
represented in the school boards
 
04:45:28.948 --> 04:45:28.958 align:start position:0%
proceedings obviously Durham has a
 
04:45:30.910 --> 04:45:30.920 align:start position:0%
disproportionate influence and that's
 
04:45:32.628 --> 04:45:32.638 align:start position:0%
not entirely inappropriate we're
 
04:45:34.270 --> 04:45:34.280 align:start position:0%
democracy we have more people than the
 
04:45:37.590 --> 04:45:37.600 align:start position:0%
others and uh luckily although there's a
 
04:45:39.230 --> 04:45:39.240 align:start position:0%
lot of difference opinions how to run
 
04:45:40.550 --> 04:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
the school district among the people
 
04:45:42.350 --> 04:45:42.360 align:start position:0%
it's not necessarily geographically
 
04:45:44.470 --> 04:45:44.480 align:start position:0%
concentrated one town or another and we
 
04:45:49.150 --> 04:45:49.160 align:start position:0%
have one fairly small town uh which is
 
04:45:51.190 --> 04:45:51.200 align:start position:0%
Madbury although it's about 5% of the
 
04:45:53.550 --> 04:45:53.560 align:start position:0%
population um so it's but there are
 
04:45:56.070 --> 04:45:56.080 align:start position:0%
other much smaller towns in Madbury that
 
04:45:58.628 --> 04:45:58.638 align:start position:0%
are part of Cooperative school districts
 
04:46:01.150 --> 04:46:01.160 align:start position:0%
uh well the smallest incorporate towns
 
04:46:02.910 --> 04:46:02.920 align:start position:0%
heart location and I think it's
 
04:46:04.788 --> 04:46:04.798 align:start position:0%
elsewhere don't seem to have Cooperative
 
04:46:05.948 --> 04:46:05.958 align:start position:0%
school districts they just have their
 
04:46:07.390 --> 04:46:07.400 align:start position:0%
own school district and tuition to
 
04:46:09.110 --> 04:46:09.120 align:start position:0%
neighboring communities but like
 
04:46:12.628 --> 04:46:12.638 align:start position:0%
Roxberry population 20 20 which is the
 
04:46:15.310 --> 04:46:15.320 align:start position:0%
third largest town in the state is part
 
04:46:19.030 --> 04:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
of the manad school district the orange
 
04:46:20.550 --> 04:46:20.560 align:start position:0%
which is the fifth smallest community in
 
04:46:24.350 --> 04:46:24.360 align:start position:0%
the state is a part of the masoma Valley
 
04:46:25.948 --> 04:46:25.958 align:start position:0%
School District which I'm familiar with
 
04:46:27.910 --> 04:46:27.920 align:start position:0%
because I used to work in Enfield which
 
04:46:29.628 --> 04:46:29.638 align:start position:0%
is where the masoma Valley High School
 
04:46:31.990 --> 04:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
is and used to live in the next town
 
04:46:35.788 --> 04:46:35.798 align:start position:0%
over in in Lebanon and um and they have
 
04:46:38.548 --> 04:46:38.558 align:start position:0%
uh I know the case of masoma Valley they
 
04:46:40.430 --> 04:46:40.440 align:start position:0%
have members from all five towns in the
 
04:46:42.270 --> 04:46:42.280 align:start position:0%
district um including orange which is
 
04:46:45.510 --> 04:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
very small and Grafton which is not much
 
04:46:49.230 --> 04:46:49.240 align:start position:0%
bigger and um so if there was a
 
04:46:52.070 --> 04:46:52.080 align:start position:0%
vacancy and somebody happened to live in
 
04:46:55.150 --> 04:46:55.160 align:start position:0%
or Grafton or Kanan um no not Kanan is
 
04:46:56.948 --> 04:46:56.958 align:start position:0%
not really the problem but but
 
04:46:59.350 --> 04:46:59.360 align:start position:0%
Orange um they would have to find
 
04:47:02.110 --> 04:47:02.120 align:start position:0%
somebody else from that exact town be
 
04:47:04.590 --> 04:47:04.600 align:start position:0%
whether it be Grafton or or orange and
 
04:47:06.350 --> 04:47:06.360 align:start position:0%
the population of the towns is so small
 
04:47:08.110 --> 04:47:08.120 align:start position:0%
there may not necessarily be anybody
 
04:47:09.590 --> 04:47:09.600 align:start position:0%
who's interested in serving on the
 
04:47:12.670 --> 04:47:12.680 align:start position:0%
school board or anybody
 
04:47:14.948 --> 04:47:14.958 align:start position:0%
who's qualified doing the school board
 
04:47:17.030 --> 04:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
amongst the PO population of the towns
 
04:47:18.510 --> 04:47:18.520 align:start position:0%
they might have a hard time finding
 
04:47:21.190 --> 04:47:21.200 align:start position:0%
someone suitable to a point um and that
 
04:47:22.548 --> 04:47:22.558 align:start position:0%
would be even worse if some place as
 
04:47:24.350 --> 04:47:24.360 align:start position:0%
small as Hearts location happened to be
 
04:47:25.948 --> 04:47:25.958 align:start position:0%
in a Cooperative School District which
 
04:47:27.750 --> 04:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
happily for the purpose of the bill
 
04:47:30.910 --> 04:47:30.920 align:start position:0%
they're not so the thing in so part
 
04:47:33.430 --> 04:47:33.440 align:start position:0%
second part of the bill line 26 to 28 uh
 
04:47:37.350 --> 04:47:37.360 align:start position:0%
if you move forward with it um you would
 
04:47:39.110 --> 04:47:39.120 align:start position:0%
probably have to have some sort of a
 
04:47:42.708 --> 04:47:42.718 align:start position:0%
fallback position for if nobody actually
 
04:47:44.830 --> 04:47:44.840 align:start position:0%
wants to be on the school board in those
 
04:47:49.470 --> 04:47:49.480 align:start position:0%
towns um and uh and also the first part
 
04:47:51.030 --> 04:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
of it was the problem with an early Bill
 
04:47:52.590 --> 04:47:52.600 align:start position:0%
talked about you could get into huge one
 
04:47:54.708 --> 04:47:54.718 align:start position:0%
person one point votes if you do that
 
04:47:56.310 --> 04:47:56.320 align:start position:0%
for example like our the charter the
 
04:47:59.750 --> 04:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
oyer of school district Le in uh Madbury
 
04:48:01.070 --> 04:48:01.080 align:start position:0%
I think they're guaranteed a seat in the
 
04:48:02.628 --> 04:48:02.638 align:start position:0%
school district so if only the voters in
 
04:48:04.990 --> 04:48:05.000 align:start position:0%
Madbury were voting they'd have about uh
 
04:48:06.470 --> 04:48:06.480 align:start position:0%
you know you'd have a population
 
04:48:08.548 --> 04:48:08.558 align:start position:0%
deviation of I don't know like 40,000
 
04:48:10.150 --> 04:48:10.160 align:start position:0%
per or something way above the pl
 
04:48:13.030 --> 04:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
standard Plus orus 5% or plus or minus
 
04:48:16.470 --> 04:48:16.480 align:start position:0%
10% so that's just U so that's a big
 
04:48:18.390 --> 04:48:18.400 align:start position:0%
problem with with both of these things
 
04:48:20.110 --> 04:48:20.120 align:start position:0%
and I don't know how often it's
 
04:48:23.948 --> 04:48:23.958 align:start position:0%
necessary usually yeah as I said usually
 
04:48:25.628 --> 04:48:25.638 align:start position:0%
the educational needs of the smaller
 
04:48:27.390 --> 04:48:27.400 align:start position:0%
towns are similar to those of the larger
 
04:48:29.430 --> 04:48:29.440 align:start position:0%
towns so there isn't usually necessarily
 
04:48:31.510 --> 04:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
be that much geographical dissension and
 
04:48:33.948 --> 04:48:33.958 align:start position:0%
if there is you know it's difficult but
 
04:48:35.470 --> 04:48:35.480 align:start position:0%
is possible to split the Cooperative
 
04:48:37.430 --> 04:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
School District into you know smaller
 
04:48:40.830 --> 04:48:40.840 align:start position:0%
pieces so I would just say uh they'll
 
04:48:42.510 --> 04:48:42.520 align:start position:0%
probably it's probably not worth moving
 
04:48:43.910 --> 04:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
forward with it and if it do you
 
04:48:45.750 --> 04:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
obviously you're going to want to like
 
04:48:47.788 --> 04:48:47.798 align:start position:0%
retain it and you know tweak the
 
04:48:49.670 --> 04:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
language of it even if you like the idea
 
04:48:51.390 --> 04:48:51.400 align:start position:0%
behind the bill so I just think it's
 
04:48:54.628 --> 04:48:54.638 align:start position:0%
problematic so I would if I was on the
 
04:48:56.910 --> 04:48:56.920 align:start position:0%
committee I and an not to pass came by I
 
04:48:59.670 --> 04:48:59.680 align:start position:0%
would probably vote no on it but so
 
04:49:00.830 --> 04:49:00.840 align:start position:0%
thanks I'd be happy to take any
 
04:49:02.430 --> 04:49:02.440 align:start position:0%
questions if anybody has are there
 
04:49:04.310 --> 04:49:04.320 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee yeah seeing
 
04:49:05.788 --> 04:49:05.798 align:start position:0%
none thank that I can answer them but
 
04:49:07.590 --> 04:49:07.600 align:start position:0%
thank no worries all right with that we
 
04:49:09.628 --> 04:49:09.638 align:start position:0%
will close the public hearing for House
 
04:49:12.390 --> 04:49:12.400 align:start position:0%
Bill 412 there was no one on the blue
 
04:49:16.750 --> 04:49:16.760 align:start position:0%
sheet and online it was I don't know why
 
04:49:19.590 --> 04:49:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:23.788 --> 04:49:23.798 align:start position:0%
it 412 online no we're
 
04:49:31.030 --> 04:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:41.708 --> 04:49:41.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:45.190 --> 04:49:45.200 align:start position:0%
okay on that that expense uh there's one
 
04:49:48.750 --> 04:49:48.760 align:start position:0%
in support 13 opposed one neutral um
 
04:49:50.150 --> 04:49:50.160 align:start position:0%
when I loaded it up it said there was
 
04:49:53.670 --> 04:49:53.680 align:start position:0%
600 in support it's just it's a lot of
 
04:49:55.270 --> 04:49:55.280 align:start position:0%
some glitch because that was a I'm glad
 
04:49:56.590 --> 04:49:56.600 align:start position:0%
I D I'm glad I made it refresh because
 
04:49:58.910 --> 04:49:58.920 align:start position:0%
there was not that much traffic on the
 
04:50:01.590 --> 04:50:01.600 align:start position:0%

like to introduce House Bill 429 and I
 
04:51:01.150 --> 04:51:01.160 align:start position:0%
will not be taking questions it's the
 
04:51:03.510 --> 04:51:03.520 align:start position:0%
best introduction all right we will
 
04:51:06.990 --> 04:51:07.000 align:start position:0%
start off with our own representative
 
04:51:20.830 --> 04:51:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:22.310 --> 04:51:22.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you committee
 
04:51:24.830 --> 04:51:24.840 align:start position:0%
members I'll be very brief I do not
 
04:51:27.030 --> 04:51:27.040 align:start position:0%
support HB
 
04:51:30.830 --> 04:51:30.840 align:start position:0%
429 uh and I'll explain quickly why we
 
04:51:34.190 --> 04:51:34.200 align:start position:0%
are varied across the state north to
 
04:51:35.470 --> 04:51:35.480 align:start position:0%
south east to
 
04:51:38.548 --> 04:51:38.558 align:start position:0%
west last year Coos County uh put a bill
 
04:51:43.150 --> 04:51:43.160 align:start position:0%
in the delegation to change our elected
 
04:51:46.390 --> 04:51:46.400 align:start position:0%
officials our uh Register of Deeds our
 
04:51:48.868 --> 04:51:48.878 align:start position:0%
Sheriff our Treasurer our County
 
04:51:50.990 --> 04:51:51.000 align:start position:0%
attorney to go from a two-year term to a
 
04:51:53.070 --> 04:51:53.080 align:start position:0%
four-year term because we felt it was
 
04:51:55.628 --> 04:51:55.638 align:start position:0%
very important to have some continuity
 
04:51:58.190 --> 04:51:58.200 align:start position:0%
and we thought we could attract better
 
04:52:00.548 --> 04:52:00.558 align:start position:0%
uh candidates for those positions it
 
04:52:02.590 --> 04:52:02.600 align:start position:0%
passed it was signed so that's the way
 
04:52:05.590 --> 04:52:05.600 align:start position:0%
is it is in coas County we never assumed
 
04:52:07.510 --> 04:52:07.520 align:start position:0%
that it was going to be the best for
 
04:52:07.520 --> 04:52:08.548 align:start position:0%
that it was going to be the best for
every

04:52:08.548 --> 04:52:08.558 align:start position:0%
every
 
04:52:11.788 --> 04:52:11.798 align:start position:0%
County right now the I am the co-chair
 
04:52:14.110 --> 04:52:14.120 align:start position:0%
of the delegation we have a very good
 
04:52:16.470 --> 04:52:16.480 align:start position:0%
working relationship with our County
 
04:52:19.910 --> 04:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
Commissioners um we have no issues we'd
 
04:52:22.750 --> 04:52:22.760 align:start position:0%
like to keep this the system the same
 
04:52:24.110 --> 04:52:24.120 align:start position:0%
and the biggest thing is having
 
04:52:27.830 --> 04:52:27.840 align:start position:0%
continuity and having the uh terms being
 
04:52:29.110 --> 04:52:29.120 align:start position:0%
a little bit longer that twoyear to
 
04:52:29.120 --> 04:52:30.150 align:start position:0%
a little bit longer that twoyear to
four-year

04:52:30.150 --> 04:52:30.160 align:start position:0%
four-year
 
04:52:32.788 --> 04:52:32.798 align:start position:0%
term uh I would suggest if the sponsor
 
04:52:34.310 --> 04:52:34.320 align:start position:0%
of the bill is having problems his
 
04:52:36.590 --> 04:52:36.600 align:start position:0%
County put a bill in to change your
 
04:52:39.030 --> 04:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
county but to have something widespread
 
04:52:41.030 --> 04:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
across the state uh because you're
 
04:52:43.548 --> 04:52:43.558 align:start position:0%
having a problem isn't in my opinion the
 
04:52:46.270 --> 04:52:46.280 align:start position:0%
solution thank you will you be taking
 
04:52:47.788 --> 04:52:47.798 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee yes I will
 
04:52:49.548 --> 04:52:49.558 align:start position:0%
are there questions from the
 
04:52:49.558 --> 04:52:50.868 align:start position:0%
are there questions from the
representative

04:52:50.868 --> 04:52:50.878 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:52:53.110 --> 04:52:53.120 align:start position:0%
Gilmore is there any other County that
 
04:52:55.150 --> 04:52:55.160 align:start position:0%
has a four-year term from what I
 
04:52:58.030 --> 04:52:58.040 align:start position:0%
understand Rockingham does okay thank
 
04:52:58.040 --> 04:53:00.910 align:start position:0%
understand Rockingham does okay thank
you

04:53:00.910 --> 04:53:00.920 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:53:04.150 --> 04:53:04.160 align:start position:0%
um okay seeing um the only thing about
 
04:53:05.270 --> 04:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
this is not really related to the bill
 
04:53:06.990 --> 04:53:07.000 align:start position:0%
but something to note is when they adopt
 
04:53:09.150 --> 04:53:09.160 align:start position:0%
these fouryear especially for the County
 
04:53:11.030 --> 04:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
Commissioners when they adopt these
 
04:53:11.040 --> 04:53:13.150 align:start position:0%
Commissioners when they adopt these
four-year

04:53:13.150 --> 04:53:13.160 align:start position:0%
four-year
 
04:53:17.230 --> 04:53:17.240 align:start position:0%
um uh terms it does create headaches in
 
04:53:20.070 --> 04:53:20.080 align:start position:0%
redistricting because their district
 
04:53:22.230 --> 04:53:22.240 align:start position:0%
will change while they're serving um and
 
04:53:24.110 --> 04:53:24.120 align:start position:0%
it creates legal questions um but that's
 
04:53:25.670 --> 04:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
not that that's not relative to the to
 
04:53:27.110 --> 04:53:27.120 align:start position:0%
the bill just something
 
04:53:29.070 --> 04:53:29.080 align:start position:0%
to when when other counties are
 
04:53:30.628 --> 04:53:30.638 align:start position:0%
considering this you have to consider
 
04:53:32.150 --> 04:53:32.160 align:start position:0%
the math and it's impossible to get it
 
04:53:34.390 --> 04:53:34.400 align:start position:0%
to work because there's 10 year 10 years
 
04:53:35.910 --> 04:53:35.920 align:start position:0%
every ring and foure intervals it
 
04:53:38.788 --> 04:53:38.798 align:start position:0%
doesn't work um anyways uh next up is
 
04:53:41.110 --> 04:53:41.120 align:start position:0%
representative Timothy Horan sorry I
 
04:53:42.868 --> 04:53:42.878 align:start position:0%
just felt the need to Aline that has
 
04:53:56.628 --> 04:53:56.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:01.190 --> 04:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
bill yep so I'm continu to be represent
 
04:54:02.708 --> 04:54:02.718 align:start position:0%
Timothy Oregon from straford County
 
04:54:04.788 --> 04:54:04.798 align:start position:0%
District 10 the town of Durham and
 
04:54:06.310 --> 04:54:06.320 align:start position:0%
straford County was the county that
 
04:54:08.948 --> 04:54:08.958 align:start position:0%
originally till few years ago didn't
 
04:54:10.628 --> 04:54:10.638 align:start position:0%
have any County Commissioner District
 
04:54:12.190 --> 04:54:12.200 align:start position:0%
but that's not really affected by this
 
04:54:15.670 --> 04:54:15.680 align:start position:0%
bill so the um this bill of course
 
04:54:16.868 --> 04:54:16.878 align:start position:0%
probably should have been a municipal
 
04:54:18.390 --> 04:54:18.400 align:start position:0%
and County government and actually they
 
04:54:21.628 --> 04:54:21.638 align:start position:0%
had a the the two sponsors had a bill
 
04:54:23.390 --> 04:54:23.400 align:start position:0%
about the Grafton County Commission
 
04:54:25.510 --> 04:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
which uh well they didn't show actually
 
04:54:27.910 --> 04:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
show up to introduce the bill but it got
 
04:54:29.708 --> 04:54:29.718 align:start position:0%
a lot of opposition from Grafton County
 
04:54:32.750 --> 04:54:32.760 align:start position:0%
and Statewide but that uh that's
 
04:54:34.150 --> 04:54:34.160 align:start position:0%
Municipal and County government's
 
04:54:37.990 --> 04:54:38.000 align:start position:0%
problem so they um and also so it's
 
04:54:39.430 --> 04:54:39.440 align:start position:0%
fairly unlikely as far as you know
 
04:54:41.708 --> 04:54:41.718 align:start position:0%
there's any support in Grafton County or
 
04:54:44.390 --> 04:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
any other County you know for making all
 
04:54:46.030 --> 04:54:46.040 align:start position:0%
the county commissioner terms two years
 
04:54:47.670 --> 04:54:47.680 align:start position:0%
a number of counties do have fouryear
 
04:54:49.390 --> 04:54:49.400 align:start position:0%
terms for County
 
04:54:51.470 --> 04:54:51.480 align:start position:0%
Commission um so there's doesn't seem to
 
04:54:55.150 --> 04:54:55.160 align:start position:0%
be any public outcry for this so there
 
04:54:59.390 --> 04:54:59.400 align:start position:0%
and also even you know even if you
 
04:55:01.030 --> 04:55:01.040 align:start position:0%
decide you like the idea want to move
 
04:55:03.190 --> 04:55:03.200 align:start position:0%
forward with it the way it's
 
04:55:05.590 --> 04:55:05.600 align:start position:0%
uh the way it's drafted I think it's
 
04:55:07.350 --> 04:55:07.360 align:start position:0%
problematic you could probably just do
 
04:55:08.788 --> 04:55:08.798 align:start position:0%
the whole thing by one line by just
 
04:55:10.350 --> 04:55:10.360 align:start position:0%
saying all County Commissioners have
 
04:55:11.948 --> 04:55:11.958 align:start position:0%
two-year terms it might need a little
 
04:55:13.310 --> 04:55:13.320 align:start position:0%
bit more detail to deal with the
 
04:55:16.750 --> 04:55:16.760 align:start position:0%
existing fouryear terms but uh that
 
04:55:18.310 --> 04:55:18.320 align:start position:0%
could probably be done much more simply
 
04:55:21.110 --> 04:55:21.120 align:start position:0%
than having this list a through I which
 
04:55:23.190 --> 04:55:23.200 align:start position:0%
by the way is not in any discernable
 
04:55:25.510 --> 04:55:25.520 align:start position:0%
order so like you know Hillsboro Carol
 
04:55:27.948 --> 04:55:27.958 align:start position:0%
straford ends with Coos and Grafton so I
 
04:55:30.548 --> 04:55:30.558 align:start position:0%
have no idea why they why it's in that
 
04:55:31.830 --> 04:55:31.840 align:start position:0%
order although that's a problem with
 
04:55:33.150 --> 04:55:33.160 align:start position:0%
other Law related to County
 
04:55:35.750 --> 04:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
Commissioners so I I would say uh this
 
04:55:37.708 --> 04:55:37.718 align:start position:0%
is a I say this is a fundamentally
 
04:55:39.628 --> 04:55:39.638 align:start position:0%
unnecessary Bill and even if I'm wrong
 
04:55:43.150 --> 04:55:43.160 align:start position:0%
and it is NE necessary uh you could take
 
04:55:45.510 --> 04:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
those 23 lines and combine them into two
 
04:55:48.270 --> 04:55:48.280 align:start position:0%
or three and have a much you know much
 
04:55:50.708 --> 04:55:50.718 align:start position:0%
cleaner uh you know much cleaner much
 
04:55:53.270 --> 04:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
cleaner way of doing it especially if
 
04:55:55.990 --> 04:55:56.000 align:start position:0%
might get com especially if if straford
 
04:55:57.670 --> 04:55:57.680 align:start position:0%
County goes back at some point in the
 
04:55:59.270 --> 04:55:59.280 align:start position:0%
future to have an at llarge District or
 
04:56:00.868 --> 04:56:00.878 align:start position:0%
if any other county is an at llarge
 
04:56:02.350 --> 04:56:02.360 align:start position:0%
District the language of here would
 
04:56:04.628 --> 04:56:04.638 align:start position:0%
probably kind of break whereas if you
 
04:56:05.628 --> 04:56:05.638 align:start position:0%
just want to say all County
 
04:56:07.230 --> 04:56:07.240 align:start position:0%
Commissioners have two-year districts
 
04:56:08.750 --> 04:56:08.760 align:start position:0%
that's you should probably just say that
 
04:56:11.070 --> 04:56:11.080 align:start position:0%
but I think I think you should leave the
 
04:56:14.510 --> 04:56:14.520 align:start position:0%
law alone because there's no support for
 
04:56:16.030 --> 04:56:16.040 align:start position:0%
far as I know there's no support for
 
04:56:17.910 --> 04:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
changing any of the existing four-year
 
04:56:20.470 --> 04:56:20.480 align:start position:0%
County Commissioners terms back to two
 
04:56:23.390 --> 04:56:23.400 align:start position:0%
years except by the sponsors who for
 
04:56:25.190 --> 04:56:25.200 align:start position:0%
whatever reason are not even here and
 
04:56:27.430 --> 04:56:27.440 align:start position:0%
weren't here for another related bill
 
04:56:28.708 --> 04:56:28.718 align:start position:0%
that they had in mpal and County
 
04:56:31.990 --> 04:56:32.000 align:start position:0%
government so I I I would I'd urge you
 
04:56:35.230 --> 04:56:35.240 align:start position:0%
to uh itl this bill and thanks have any
 
04:56:36.910 --> 04:56:36.920 align:start position:0%
I have any questions you can try to I
 
04:56:38.628 --> 04:56:38.638 align:start position:0%
can answer them maybe questions from the

04:57:16.590 --> 04:57:16.600 align:start position:0%
Stewartstown in my brev for the record
 
04:57:19.030 --> 04:57:19.040 align:start position:0%
my name is Steve sherle from a uh
 
04:57:20.788 --> 04:57:20.798 align:start position:0%
resident of Ward one of conquer the
 
04:57:23.708 --> 04:57:23.718 align:start position:0%
village of Penacook and last November
 
04:57:25.470 --> 04:57:25.480 align:start position:0%
after 20 years in the house I was
 
04:57:28.868 --> 04:57:28.878 align:start position:0%
elected to Marram County Commission and
 
04:57:30.830 --> 04:57:30.840 align:start position:0%
having spent 20 years going to County
 
04:57:33.150 --> 04:57:33.160 align:start position:0%
delegation meetings I felt being elected
 
04:57:34.910 --> 04:57:34.920 align:start position:0%
as a commissioner I knew everything I
 
04:57:38.150 --> 04:57:38.160 align:start position:0%
needed to know uh through that and uh as
 
04:57:39.910 --> 04:57:39.920 align:start position:0%
soon as I got elected I realized how
 
04:57:42.230 --> 04:57:42.240 align:start position:0%
much which I didn't know and I've been
 
04:57:44.470 --> 04:57:44.480 align:start position:0%
very fortunate I happen to be a Democrat
 
04:57:46.190 --> 04:57:46.200 align:start position:0%
my two other Commissioners are
 
04:57:48.430 --> 04:57:48.440 align:start position:0%
Republicans and they have they have
 
04:57:51.110 --> 04:57:51.120 align:start position:0%
become friends but even more so they've
 
04:57:53.390 --> 04:57:53.400 align:start position:0%
become mentors to me along with our
 
04:57:55.510 --> 04:57:55.520 align:start position:0%
outstanding County uh
 
04:57:57.708 --> 04:57:57.718 align:start position:0%
employees I'm going I'm going to end
 
04:57:59.230 --> 04:57:59.240 align:start position:0%
right there but I'm just going to say
 
04:58:01.310 --> 04:58:01.320 align:start position:0%
I'm sure the sponsors of this Bill had a
 
04:58:03.948 --> 04:58:03.958 align:start position:0%
good intention but apparently it seems
 
04:58:06.030 --> 04:58:06.040 align:start position:0%
to be a solution to a problem that just
 
04:58:07.948 --> 04:58:07.958 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist and I would ask this
 
04:58:11.788 --> 04:58:11.798 align:start position:0%
committee to please to uh Lo itl and I'd
 
04:58:13.548 --> 04:58:13.558 align:start position:0%
be glad to take any questions Mr
 
04:58:16.390 --> 04:58:16.400 align:start position:0%

Raymond

04:58:22.350 --> 04:58:22.360 align:start position:0%
Raymond
 
04:58:28.910 --> 04:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:32.070 --> 04:58:32.080 align:start position:0%
Horan so Raymond Gorman my hometown is
 
04:58:34.470 --> 04:58:34.480 align:start position:0%
corob New Hampshire I'm a county
 
04:58:38.270 --> 04:58:38.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner in KS County for District 3
 
04:58:40.390 --> 04:58:40.400 align:start position:0%
my District's a a large District it
 
04:58:42.390 --> 04:58:42.400 align:start position:0%
starts at the southern end of the county
 
04:58:45.788 --> 04:58:45.798 align:start position:0%
at Carroll up to gorm and then I have we
 
04:58:47.708 --> 04:58:47.718 align:start position:0%
start we switch over and we have all the
 
04:58:50.830 --> 04:58:50.840 align:start position:0%
rest of the northern my district is the
 
04:58:54.310 --> 04:58:54.320 align:start position:0%
Pittsburgh cber stewartown Etc I think I
 
04:58:58.430 --> 04:58:58.440 align:start position:0%
have 18 unincorporated towns um so our
 
04:59:01.868 --> 04:59:01.878 align:start position:0%
county is the unincorporated towns adds
 
04:59:04.110 --> 04:59:04.120 align:start position:0%
a whole another element to County
 
04:59:06.150 --> 04:59:06.160 align:start position:0%
government we're selecting for all those
 
04:59:08.750 --> 04:59:08.760 align:start position:0%
communities the 20 plus count uh
 
04:59:10.548 --> 04:59:10.558 align:start position:0%
unincorporated towns
 
04:59:12.830 --> 04:59:12.840 align:start position:0%
what it takes to learn I was fortunate
 
04:59:14.548 --> 04:59:14.558 align:start position:0%
that my first term I'm now on my second
 
04:59:18.270 --> 04:59:18.280 align:start position:0%
term was a four-year term and I I was
 
04:59:21.030 --> 04:59:21.040 align:start position:0%
came in in 2020 I had Co so my first
 
04:59:23.868 --> 04:59:23.878 align:start position:0%
year was a lost year spent on a computer
 
04:59:26.548 --> 04:59:26.558 align:start position:0%
screen and there's a learning curve to
 
04:59:29.788 --> 04:59:29.798 align:start position:0%
be an a county commissioner and it's I
 
04:59:32.150 --> 04:59:32.160 align:start position:0%
think that the continuity is is
 
04:59:33.430 --> 04:59:33.440 align:start position:0%
something that we really need to talk
 
04:59:35.670 --> 04:59:35.680 align:start position:0%
about here is to have at least one
 
04:59:38.230 --> 04:59:38.240 align:start position:0%
commissioner there after each election
 
04:59:40.430 --> 04:59:40.440 align:start position:0%
that has experience all right it's
 
04:59:42.990 --> 04:59:43.000 align:start position:0%
worked well in Coos um we have two
 
04:59:45.590 --> 04:59:45.600 align:start position:0%
nursing homes as well and it it just
 
04:59:47.830 --> 04:59:47.840 align:start position:0%
there's no need to change this uh the
 
04:59:51.430 --> 04:59:51.440 align:start position:0%
work that our my the folks did last year
 
04:59:54.030 --> 04:59:54.040 align:start position:0%
with the county treasur sheriff Etc like
 
04:59:56.628 --> 04:59:56.638 align:start position:0%
that was well received and well
 
04:59:59.310 --> 04:59:59.320 align:start position:0%
supported so uh we weren't looking for
 
05:00:00.910 --> 05:00:00.920 align:start position:0%
any changes on the county commissioner
 
05:00:03.548 --> 05:00:03.558 align:start position:0%
level at that time and are absolutely
 
05:00:07.430 --> 05:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
not looking for any changes today um
 
05:00:09.230 --> 05:00:09.240 align:start position:0%
pretty simple uh I can get into more
 
05:00:10.868 --> 05:00:10.878 align:start position:0%
details if you like and be glad to
 
05:00:12.670 --> 05:00:12.680 align:start position:0%

testimony it is I I'm bad I didn't do it
 
05:00:28.990 --> 05:00:29.000 align:start position:0%

05:00:31.430 --> 05:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
hold it against you too much apologies
 
05:00:33.548 --> 05:00:33.558 align:start position:0%
Mr chair my name is Kate Horan uh
 
05:00:34.750 --> 05:00:34.760 align:start position:0%
representing the New Hampshire
 
05:00:36.470 --> 05:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
Association of counties and I am pinch
 
05:00:38.310 --> 05:00:38.320 align:start position:0%
hitting for commissioner Tom Morell from
 
05:00:41.190 --> 05:00:41.200 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County the uh afternoon he
 
05:00:43.910 --> 05:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
apologizes he had a electrician job that
 
05:00:47.708 --> 05:00:47.718 align:start position:0%
he got called to um so he did uh ask me
 
05:00:50.070 --> 05:00:50.080 align:start position:0%
to step in and offer testimony on behalf
 
05:00:52.628 --> 05:00:52.638 align:start position:0%
of the association the association is
 
05:00:54.910 --> 05:00:54.920 align:start position:0%
opposed to this bill there are eight
 
05:00:56.948 --> 05:00:56.958 align:start position:0%
counties that currently have a four-year
 
05:00:58.868 --> 05:00:58.878 align:start position:0%
float the Commissioners did a great job
 
05:01:01.430 --> 05:01:01.440 align:start position:0%
talking about continuity uh commissioner
 
05:01:03.390 --> 05:01:03.400 align:start position:0%
Tom Bell did ask me to highlight
 
05:01:05.830 --> 05:01:05.840 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County in particular
 
05:01:07.830 --> 05:01:07.840 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County does not have a County
 
05:01:09.548 --> 05:01:09.558 align:start position:0%
Administrator that runs the day-to-day
 
05:01:11.270 --> 05:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
operation operations the Commissioners
 
05:01:13.350 --> 05:01:13.360 align:start position:0%
run the day-to-day operations in
 
05:01:16.430 --> 05:01:16.440 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County um so having that
 
05:01:18.350 --> 05:01:18.360 align:start position:0%
floating four-year term is really
 
05:01:19.628 --> 05:01:19.638 align:start position:0%
important right now they're in the
 
05:01:22.910 --> 05:01:22.920 align:start position:0%
middle of a very large building project
 
05:01:24.390 --> 05:01:24.400 align:start position:0%
that is happening that is going to house
 
05:01:26.190 --> 05:01:26.200 align:start position:0%
deeds in the Sheriff's Office and a
 
05:01:29.628 --> 05:01:29.638 align:start position:0%
couple other County facilities um and
 
05:01:32.150 --> 05:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
having someone there after each election
 
05:01:33.510 --> 05:01:33.520 align:start position:0%
while they're going through this
 
05:01:35.270 --> 05:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
construction process is extremely
 
05:01:37.470 --> 05:01:37.480 align:start position:0%
important to them uh so the association
 
05:01:39.910 --> 05:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
ask that you uh itl the bill and I'm
 
05:01:41.430 --> 05:01:41.440 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions okay other
 
05:01:43.270 --> 05:01:43.280 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee seeing done
 
05:01:45.350 --> 05:01:45.360 align:start position:0%
thank you um onl I don't have any more
 
05:01:46.788 --> 05:01:46.798 align:start position:0%
pink cards online there was two in
 
05:01:49.350 --> 05:01:49.360 align:start position:0%
support 10 opposed uh on the blue sheet
 
05:01:51.868 --> 05:01:51.878 align:start position:0%
was zero in support and one opposed not
 
05:01:53.910 --> 05:01:53.920 align:start position:0%
speaking and with that we will close the
 
05:01:57.510 --> 05:01:57.520 align:start position:0%
public hearing for House Bill uh
 
05:02:00.948 --> 05:02:00.958 align:start position:0%
429 and we will stand in recess until
 
05:02:02.990 --> 05:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
House Bill 333 but I have a statement I
 
05:02:05.070 --> 05:02:05.080 align:start position:0%
want to make uh because this has come up
 
05:02:08.030 --> 05:02:08.040 align:start position:0%
a couple times today election law is
 
05:02:11.708 --> 05:02:11.718 align:start position:0%
section is uh section 63 of the New
 
05:02:14.310 --> 05:02:14.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire RSA it covers every RSA
 
05:02:21.030 --> 05:02:21.040 align:start position:0%
chapter 252 to 27 chapter 2 652 to 671
 
05:02:23.670 --> 05:02:23.680 align:start position:0%
so anything in there is election law and
 
05:02:25.070 --> 05:02:25.080 align:start position:0%
we a couple times today people said I
 
05:02:26.230 --> 05:02:26.240 align:start position:0%
don't know why this bill is an election
 
05:02:29.590 --> 05:02:29.600 align:start position:0%
law you're literally amending an RSA
 
05:02:33.310 --> 05:02:33.320 align:start position:0%
where the title of the chapter is Town
 
05:02:35.708 --> 05:02:35.718 align:start position:0%
elections so it is most certainly in our
 
05:02:37.190 --> 05:02:37.200 align:start position:0%
purview please committee members stop
 
05:02:38.670 --> 05:02:38.680 align:start position:0%
trying to give away our Authority we
 
05:02:40.310 --> 05:02:40.320 align:start position:0%
have that entire section
 
05:02:43.868 --> 05:02:43.878 align:start position:0%
652 all the way to 671 if you if you
 
05:02:45.788 --> 05:02:45.798 align:start position:0%

I'm still filling my way around on uh

the processes and the rules uh but I'm
 
05:09:27.830 --> 05:09:27.840 align:start position:0%

05:09:29.910 --> 05:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
candidate for office so I have some
 
05:09:32.830 --> 05:09:32.840 align:start position:0%
experience related to this subject and
 
05:09:36.310 --> 05:09:36.320 align:start position:0%
uh I'm sure everybody in this uh uh
 
05:09:37.910 --> 05:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
committee room as well as everybody in
 
05:09:41.110 --> 05:09:41.120 align:start position:0%
the legislature has
 
05:09:43.430 --> 05:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
I'm here to introduce House Bill 333 as
 
05:09:45.628 --> 05:09:45.638 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor before I start my
 
05:09:47.548 --> 05:09:47.558 align:start position:0%
comments on the bill before you I'd like
 
05:09:49.708 --> 05:09:49.718 align:start position:0%
to commend the committee for its ongoing
 
05:09:51.590 --> 05:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
work to ensure overall election
 
05:09:53.990 --> 05:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
Integrity which is vital to maintaining
 
05:09:57.190 --> 05:09:57.200 align:start position:0%
a vibrant Democratic Republic a key part
 
05:09:58.948 --> 05:09:58.958 align:start position:0%
of your committee is balancing two
 
05:10:01.310 --> 05:10:01.320 align:start position:0%
important and sometimes competing
 
05:10:03.350 --> 05:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
interests protecting the rights of
 
05:10:05.350 --> 05:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
Voters to be able to access polling
 
05:10:07.030 --> 05:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
places free of harassment or
 
05:10:08.948 --> 05:10:08.958 align:start position:0%
intimidation while at the same time
 
05:10:10.628 --> 05:10:10.638 align:start position:0%
uphold holding the First Amendment right
 
05:10:12.470 --> 05:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
of free speech afforded to candidates
 
05:10:15.270 --> 05:10:15.280 align:start position:0%
for public office who desire to provide
 
05:10:17.150 --> 05:10:17.160 align:start position:0%
information at polling places on
 
05:10:20.670 --> 05:10:20.680 align:start position:0%
Election Day to interested voters to
 
05:10:23.310 --> 05:10:23.320 align:start position:0%
quote Thomas Jefferson an informed
 
05:10:25.310 --> 05:10:25.320 align:start position:0%
citizen is at the heart of a dynamic
 
05:10:28.270 --> 05:10:28.280 align:start position:0%
democracy unquote while the existing
 
05:10:39.430 --> 05:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:41.350 --> 05:10:41.360 align:start position:0%
of candidates is required to restore
 
05:10:44.990 --> 05:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
balance in the law H Bill b House Bill
 
05:10:47.868 --> 05:10:47.878 align:start position:0%
333 is a straightforward and necessary
 
05:11:09.390 --> 05:11:09.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:12.510 --> 05:11:12.520 align:start position:0%
intention of the underlying statute this
 
05:11:14.868 --> 05:11:14.878 align:start position:0%
is particularly important in communities
 
05:11:16.990 --> 05:11:17.000 align:start position:0%
primarily in rural areas such as those
 
05:11:19.910 --> 05:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
in my district that often change polling
 
05:11:22.030 --> 05:11:22.040 align:start position:0%
places in years when there is a pres
 
05:11:22.040 --> 05:11:23.190 align:start position:0%
places in years when there is a pres
Presidential

05:11:23.190 --> 05:11:23.200 align:start position:0%
Presidential
 
05:11:27.150 --> 05:11:27.160 align:start position:0%
Election House Bill 333 is a simple
 
05:11:29.270 --> 05:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
Common Sense solution that improves
 
05:11:31.830 --> 05:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
transparency and accountability and
 
05:11:34.110 --> 05:11:34.120 align:start position:0%
clarifies access for candidates and the
 
05:11:36.788 --> 05:11:36.798 align:start position:0%
voting public to our polling places
 
05:11:38.830 --> 05:11:38.840 align:start position:0%
preserves First Amendment protections to
 
05:11:41.708 --> 05:11:41.718 align:start position:0%
all involved and reduces confusion that
 
05:11:43.390 --> 05:11:43.400 align:start position:0%
has previously led to contentious
 
05:11:46.110 --> 05:11:46.120 align:start position:0%
situations between poll workers public
 
05:11:49.150 --> 05:11:49.160 align:start position:0%
officials candidates campaign volunteers
 
05:11:50.670 --> 05:11:50.680 align:start position:0%
and the public at
 
05:11:53.470 --> 05:11:53.480 align:start position:0%
large it will have the it will have the
 
05:11:55.350 --> 05:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
added benefit of aiding the oversight
 
05:11:57.310 --> 05:11:57.320 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of the Secretary of
 
05:12:00.470 --> 05:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
State and reducing complaints I would
 
05:12:02.868 --> 05:12:02.878 align:start position:0%
add that here is essentially little or
 
05:12:06.270 --> 05:12:06.280 align:start position:0%
no cost of implementing House Bill
 
05:12:10.310 --> 05:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
333 uh I would also add I have a written
 
05:12:12.590 --> 05:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
testimony which I'll leave on the uh
 
05:12:15.190 --> 05:12:15.200 align:start position:0%
table but I also add that I've had uh
 
05:12:17.590 --> 05:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
discussions with the Secretary of State
 
05:12:21.310 --> 05:12:21.320 align:start position:0%
both before I drafted the uh original uh
 
05:12:23.788 --> 05:12:23.798 align:start position:0%
legislation and actually before I came
 
05:12:28.510 --> 05:12:28.520 align:start position:0%
in here uh to testify today and um the
 
05:12:30.670 --> 05:12:30.680 align:start position:0%
secretary of state has really no
 
05:12:33.948 --> 05:12:33.958 align:start position:0%
objections or problems with the bill as
 
05:12:37.708 --> 05:12:37.718 align:start position:0%
written um I would be happy to I'm also
 
05:12:40.510 --> 05:12:40.520 align:start position:0%
going to leave a copy of an interesting
 
05:12:44.470 --> 05:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
article um on uh entitled the role of
 
05:12:46.990 --> 05:12:47.000 align:start position:0%
the moderator as an election official
 
05:12:48.750 --> 05:12:48.760 align:start position:0%
and this is reprinted with the
 
05:12:50.150 --> 05:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
permission of the New Hampshire bar
 
05:12:51.910 --> 05:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
journal and the New Hampshire Bar
 
05:12:54.708 --> 05:12:54.718 align:start position:0%
Association and I think I found it very
 
05:12:57.510 --> 05:12:57.520 align:start position:0%
educational um uh in spite of I what I
 
05:12:59.110 --> 05:12:59.120 align:start position:0%
thought I knew about the various roles
 
05:13:01.910 --> 05:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
of election officials so I I only have
 
05:13:03.390 --> 05:13:03.400 align:start position:0%
one copy of that I'll leave it if
 
05:13:06.150 --> 05:13:06.160 align:start position:0%
anybody's interested um be happy to
 
05:13:08.708 --> 05:13:08.718 align:start position:0%
arrange uh additional copies but to
 
05:13:11.708 --> 05:13:11.718 align:start position:0%
quote from that because I've also
 
05:13:14.788 --> 05:13:14.798 align:start position:0%
consulted with uh people who are
 
05:13:16.948 --> 05:13:16.958 align:start position:0%
moderators I've tried to do my homework
 
05:13:20.390 --> 05:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
on this uh subject matter and there's a
 
05:13:22.350 --> 05:13:22.360 align:start position:0%
quote in here that's kind of interesting
 
05:13:24.788 --> 05:13:24.798 align:start position:0%
and uh one of the objections that I
 
05:13:26.910 --> 05:13:26.920 align:start position:0%
heard from a moderator in my own
 
05:13:29.310 --> 05:13:29.320 align:start position:0%
delegation was that gee you know
 
05:13:31.470 --> 05:13:31.480 align:start position:0%
moderators you're just trying to load
 
05:13:34.350 --> 05:13:34.360 align:start position:0%
some more um things for a moderator to
 
05:13:38.030 --> 05:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
do and moderators are uh uh busy as it
 
05:13:40.868 --> 05:13:40.878 align:start position:0%
is on on day there's an interesting
 
05:13:44.030 --> 05:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
quote in this article that says quote on
 
05:13:46.548 --> 05:13:46.558 align:start position:0%
the local level the city or town clerks
 
05:13:48.750 --> 05:13:48.760 align:start position:0%
the Selectmen City councils or their
 
05:13:50.948 --> 05:13:50.958 align:start position:0%
counterparts and the supervisors of the
 
05:13:54.070 --> 05:13:54.080 align:start position:0%
checklist have far more to do and far
 
05:13:56.350 --> 05:13:56.360 align:start position:0%
more rules to follow in the conduct of
 
05:13:58.990 --> 05:13:59.000 align:start position:0%
an election than does the moderator it
 
05:14:01.470 --> 05:14:01.480 align:start position:0%
is overly simplistic but not entirely
 
05:14:03.230 --> 05:14:03.240 align:start position:0%
inaccurate to say that the moderator
 
05:14:05.270 --> 05:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
shows up on the morning of the election
 
05:14:07.510 --> 05:14:07.520 align:start position:0%
prior to the opening of the polls stays
 
05:14:09.948 --> 05:14:09.958 align:start position:0%
most of the day except unless he
 
05:14:11.910 --> 05:14:11.920 align:start position:0%
appoints a moderator proem for a time
 
05:14:13.750 --> 05:14:13.760 align:start position:0%
when he's absent from the polling place
 
05:14:16.510 --> 05:14:16.520 align:start position:0%
to eat lunch or to attend to his
 
05:14:19.430 --> 05:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
horses uh and remains after the close of
 
05:14:20.948 --> 05:14:20.958 align:start position:0%
the voting until the results of any
 
05:14:22.470 --> 05:14:22.480 align:start position:0%
elections which are determined by the
 
05:14:24.708 --> 05:14:24.718 align:start position:0%
district which the moderator supervisors
 
05:14:26.310 --> 05:14:26.320 align:start position:0%
have been determined and announced by
 
05:14:28.708 --> 05:14:28.718 align:start position:0%
the moderator since a moderator cannot
 
05:14:30.788 --> 05:14:30.798 align:start position:0%
by law serve as a selectman town treasur
 
05:14:32.830 --> 05:14:32.840 align:start position:0%
truste of trust funds collector of taxes
 
05:14:34.390 --> 05:14:34.400 align:start position:0%
Highway agent or supervisor of the
 
05:14:37.510 --> 05:14:37.520 align:start position:0%
checklist he or she is unlikely to have
 
05:14:39.430 --> 05:14:39.440 align:start position:0%
any other significant official interest
 
05:14:42.150 --> 05:14:42.160 align:start position:0%
in the election process and I read that
 
05:14:46.230 --> 05:14:46.240 align:start position:0%
only to kind of um um address what I
 
05:14:48.788 --> 05:14:48.798 align:start position:0%
suspect are you know the objections of
 
05:14:50.430 --> 05:14:50.440 align:start position:0%
people that are moderators about being
 
05:14:51.788 --> 05:14:51.798 align:start position:0%
overloaded with
 
05:14:51.798 --> 05:14:53.310 align:start position:0%
overloaded with
work

05:14:53.310 --> 05:14:53.320 align:start position:0%
work
 
05:14:57.310 --> 05:14:57.320 align:start position:0%
um so um I'd be happy to answer any
 
05:14:59.190 --> 05:14:59.200 align:start position:0%
questions I urge this committee to
 
05:15:02.990 --> 05:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
support a recommendation of autopass OTP
 
05:15:04.548 --> 05:15:04.558 align:start position:0%
for house pill
 
05:15:07.230 --> 05:15:07.240 align:start position:0%
333 and thank you on behalf of everyone
 
05:15:09.470 --> 05:15:09.480 align:start position:0%
committed to improving election
 
05:15:12.150 --> 05:15:12.160 align:start position:0%
uh laws in our state uh respectfully
 
05:15:15.990 --> 05:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
submitted uh Rich noveno chesher n okay
 
05:15:18.430 --> 05:15:18.440 align:start position:0%
and will you be taking questions
 
05:15:20.788 --> 05:15:20.798 align:start position:0%
representative yes sir I guess that's
 
05:15:22.110 --> 05:15:22.120 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
05:15:25.270 --> 05:15:25.280 align:start position:0%
wood thank you Mr chairman um thank you
 
05:15:27.590 --> 05:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um what I've been
 
05:15:30.670 --> 05:15:30.680 align:start position:0%
finding I've haven't uh tried to run as
 
05:15:33.910 --> 05:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
often as you have two elections so far
 
05:15:36.310 --> 05:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
and what I find is there's a breakdown
 
05:15:39.548 --> 05:15:39.558 align:start position:0%
uh in our problems um the we have the
 
05:15:43.270 --> 05:15:43.280 align:start position:0%
people running and the people who are
 
05:15:46.030 --> 05:15:46.040 align:start position:0%
voting or just there uh we have a
 
05:15:49.070 --> 05:15:49.080 align:start position:0%
conflict very very strong conflict in
 
05:15:51.070 --> 05:15:51.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement between the First Amendment
 
05:15:54.590 --> 05:15:54.600 align:start position:0%
rights and someone running uh the a
 
05:15:57.190 --> 05:15:57.200 align:start position:0%
candidate running seems to be a whole
 
05:15:59.590 --> 05:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
different setting do you see is this
 
05:16:02.190 --> 05:16:02.200 align:start position:0%
address what problem is this
 
05:16:04.150 --> 05:16:04.160 align:start position:0%
addressing well it's it's it's
 
05:16:05.910 --> 05:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
fundamentally addressing a number and
 
05:16:08.590 --> 05:16:08.600 align:start position:0%
I've run U um as I said six or seven
 
05:16:08.600 --> 05:16:09.548 align:start position:0%
I've run U um as I said six or seven
times

05:16:09.548 --> 05:16:09.558 align:start position:0%
times
 
05:16:12.350 --> 05:16:12.360 align:start position:0%
and have run into various insundry
 
05:16:15.110 --> 05:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
situations where it's not clear as I
 
05:16:18.628 --> 05:16:18.638 align:start position:0%
said one problem is uh that elections in
 
05:16:21.430 --> 05:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
small towns tend to shift their voting
 
05:16:24.430 --> 05:16:24.440 align:start position:0%
Place uh between the presidential year
 
05:16:27.150 --> 05:16:27.160 align:start position:0%
and the off year simply because the size
 
05:16:28.868 --> 05:16:28.878 align:start position:0%
of the electorate that turns out is
 
05:16:30.628 --> 05:16:30.638 align:start position:0%
different one one year it may be in in
 
05:16:32.750 --> 05:16:32.760 align:start position:0%
our case of one of the small towns in
 
05:16:35.150 --> 05:16:35.160 align:start position:0%
our district it's held at the Town Hall
 
05:16:37.230 --> 05:16:37.240 align:start position:0%
in the presidential year it's held at a
 
05:16:41.868 --> 05:16:41.878 align:start position:0%
at a school um um and uh new candidates
 
05:16:43.628 --> 05:16:43.638 align:start position:0%
especially and I would point out that I
 
05:16:46.350 --> 05:16:46.360 align:start position:0%
think on average the uh House of
 
05:16:48.510 --> 05:16:48.520 align:start position:0%
Representatives body turns over about
 
05:16:53.750 --> 05:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
30% of the 30% of the uh uh people in
 
05:16:56.670 --> 05:16:56.680 align:start position:0%
office uh every two years and so you
 
05:16:58.270 --> 05:16:58.280 align:start position:0%
have a lot of new people who are new to
 
05:17:00.510 --> 05:17:00.520 align:start position:0%
the process and they're trying to F out
 
05:17:02.670 --> 05:17:02.680 align:start position:0%
and it would be helpful to everybody to
 
05:17:04.910 --> 05:17:04.920 align:start position:0%
have Clarity on you know where I'm
 
05:17:07.590 --> 05:17:07.600 align:start position:0%
voting what the what the overall
 
05:17:09.910 --> 05:17:09.920 align:start position:0%
physical layout is where I'm where I'm
 
05:17:11.708 --> 05:17:11.718 align:start position:0%
allowed to be where I'm not allowed to
 
05:17:14.310 --> 05:17:14.320 align:start position:0%
be and I found over you know over the
 
05:17:17.788 --> 05:17:17.798 align:start position:0%
several years some moderators or towns
 
05:17:19.948 --> 05:17:19.958 align:start position:0%
in this case do a great job of marking
 
05:17:22.390 --> 05:17:22.400 align:start position:0%
out with tape on the ground and where
 
05:17:25.670 --> 05:17:25.680 align:start position:0%
you can visibly see the corridor that's
 
05:17:28.310 --> 05:17:28.320 align:start position:0%
provided uh in terms of protecting
 
05:17:30.628 --> 05:17:30.638 align:start position:0%
access unimpeded access by people going
 
05:17:34.510 --> 05:17:34.520 align:start position:0%
to the polls uh and also electioneering
 
05:17:36.628 --> 05:17:36.638 align:start position:0%
and I will also point out that the
 
05:17:40.190 --> 05:17:40.200 align:start position:0%
underlying law has specific requirements
 
05:17:43.750 --> 05:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
for um the the candidates in terms of
 
05:17:46.390 --> 05:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
being able to reach the electorate
 
05:17:49.190 --> 05:17:49.200 align:start position:0%
without interfering with access in a
 
05:17:53.830 --> 05:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
normal speaking voice um and in I I
 
05:17:57.230 --> 05:17:57.240 align:start position:0%
could name several situations where um
 
05:17:58.948 --> 05:17:58.958 align:start position:0%
even though the area wasn't marked out
 
05:18:01.070 --> 05:18:01.080 align:start position:0%
the moderator would come out and say
 
05:18:03.190 --> 05:18:03.200 align:start position:0%
this is the area that I'm quote
 
05:18:06.310 --> 05:18:06.320 align:start position:0%
designating for campaigning and that
 
05:18:08.948 --> 05:18:08.958 align:start position:0%
that is what the uh uh change in the
 
05:18:11.590 --> 05:18:11.600 align:start position:0%
legislation uh designate us a little bit
 
05:18:14.310 --> 05:18:14.320 align:start position:0%
uh fuzzy language when I looked up the
 
05:18:17.670 --> 05:18:17.680 align:start position:0%
uh the the dictionary definition so
 
05:18:20.110 --> 05:18:20.120 align:start position:0%
somebody verbally designating it
 
05:18:21.990 --> 05:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
satisfies the language the way it
 
05:18:25.150 --> 05:18:25.160 align:start position:0%
currently sits on the other hand
 
05:18:28.070 --> 05:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
designate and the clarification is hey
 
05:18:32.150 --> 05:18:32.160 align:start position:0%
Mark it out so it's clear nobody has any
 
05:18:35.150 --> 05:18:35.160 align:start position:0%
uh objection as to where it is and
 
05:18:37.868 --> 05:18:37.878 align:start position:0%
that's the clar the clarity uh part of
 
05:18:42.350 --> 05:18:42.360 align:start position:0%
the addition into this uh RSA so there
 
05:18:44.510 --> 05:18:44.520 align:start position:0%
are addition I've had a case where a
 
05:18:47.270 --> 05:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
moderator told me uh I said up you know
 
05:18:49.270 --> 05:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
there was nothing marked out I went to
 
05:18:51.350 --> 05:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
set up a table to campaign the moderator
 
05:18:53.788 --> 05:18:53.798 align:start position:0%
came out and literally said to me nope
 
05:18:56.470 --> 05:18:56.480 align:start position:0%
you can't be there you've got to be a
 
05:18:59.230 --> 05:18:59.240 align:start position:0%
thousand yards from the school and I
 
05:19:01.750 --> 05:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
looked at him and I said that can't be
 
05:19:05.070 --> 05:19:05.080 align:start position:0%
right uh uh and a thousand yards would
 
05:19:08.150 --> 05:19:08.160 align:start position:0%
have put me down on Route 10 and that's
 
05:19:11.150 --> 05:19:11.160 align:start position:0%
you know and he and the case I've been
 
05:19:13.310 --> 05:19:13.320 align:start position:0%
the moderator for 20 years and I know
 
05:19:16.830 --> 05:19:16.840 align:start position:0%
what the rules are and I said please go
 
05:19:19.270 --> 05:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
get the rule book while he was away I
 
05:19:22.030 --> 05:19:22.040 align:start position:0%
called the Secretary of State's hotline
 
05:19:25.430 --> 05:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
and I at that time I think uh uh Mr
 
05:19:28.070 --> 05:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
scanland was the Assistant Attorney
 
05:19:30.628 --> 05:19:30.638 align:start position:0%
General now the Attorney General he
 
05:19:33.070 --> 05:19:33.080 align:start position:0%
picked up the picked up the
 
05:19:34.990 --> 05:19:35.000 align:start position:0%
phone ises he
 
05:19:38.510 --> 05:19:38.520 align:start position:0%
here oh yeah okay so so if I'm speak if
 
05:19:42.270 --> 05:19:42.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:45.470 --> 05:19:45.480 align:start position:0%
you yeah I got him on the line while the
 
05:19:48.310 --> 05:19:48.320 align:start position:0%
guy was gone and explained the situation
 
05:19:50.910 --> 05:19:50.920 align:start position:0%
and he said please put him on the line
 
05:19:55.030 --> 05:19:55.040 align:start position:0%
and I'll I'll I'll sort him out which
 
05:19:58.030 --> 05:19:58.040 align:start position:0%
quite uh uh I would say to his credit
 
05:20:00.230 --> 05:20:00.240 align:start position:0%
didn't take very much uh very much time
 
05:20:03.708 --> 05:20:03.718 align:start position:0%
for him to sort it out but still uh that
 
05:20:06.830 --> 05:20:06.840 align:start position:0%
resulted in uh kind of intimidating
 
05:20:08.750 --> 05:20:08.760 align:start position:0%
candidates nobody showed up at that
 
05:20:11.110 --> 05:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
particular polling place over several
 
05:20:13.310 --> 05:20:13.320 align:start position:0%
Cycles because the word got around that
 
05:20:15.030 --> 05:20:15.040 align:start position:0%
the you know the moderator wasn't you
 
05:20:16.830 --> 05:20:16.840 align:start position:0%
know was going to put him someplace and
 
05:20:19.548 --> 05:20:19.558 align:start position:0%
didn't want to go through the hassle so
 
05:20:21.310 --> 05:20:21.320 align:start position:0%
that's a long-winded I I don't know if
 
05:20:22.788 --> 05:20:22.798 align:start position:0%
I've answered your question but there
 
05:20:24.868 --> 05:20:24.878 align:start position:0%
are a lot of and there are some safety
 
05:20:28.110 --> 05:20:28.120 align:start position:0%
issues as well uh we had I had people
 
05:20:29.628 --> 05:20:29.638 align:start position:0%
helping with my campaign who were
 
05:20:33.190 --> 05:20:33.200 align:start position:0%
literally in the town of stod put down
 
05:20:36.830 --> 05:20:36.840 align:start position:0%
uh in an area right alongside Route
 
05:20:39.510 --> 05:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
123 and every time a truck came by it
 
05:20:43.230 --> 05:20:43.240 align:start position:0%
kind of you know moved the uh moved the
 
05:20:45.548 --> 05:20:45.558 align:start position:0%
volunteers anyhow so there are a whole
 
05:20:49.030 --> 05:20:49.040 align:start position:0%
host of ISU issues that would I think
 
05:20:51.548 --> 05:20:51.558 align:start position:0%
help to spell out things in a manner
 
05:20:54.110 --> 05:20:54.120 align:start position:0%
that everybody understood clearly what
 
05:20:57.270 --> 05:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
uh what the rules the RS uh called for
 
05:21:00.110 --> 05:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
so is that more than sufficient to
 
05:21:02.390 --> 05:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
answer your question you're welcome all
 
05:21:03.390 --> 05:21:03.400 align:start position:0%
right further questions from the
 
05:21:06.350 --> 05:21:06.360 align:start position:0%
committee representative C thank you Mr
 
05:21:07.628 --> 05:21:07.638 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
05:21:10.830 --> 05:21:10.840 align:start position:0%
question uh my concern is you want this
 
05:21:13.190 --> 05:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
done within five days of the end of the
 
05:21:15.230 --> 05:21:15.240 align:start position:0%
filing period but the town may not have
 
05:21:17.788 --> 05:21:17.798 align:start position:0%
actually finalize where they're having
 
05:21:20.708 --> 05:21:20.718 align:start position:0%
the election or other aspects of the
 
05:21:22.350 --> 05:21:22.360 align:start position:0%
building that the election is going to
 
05:21:24.750 --> 05:21:24.760 align:start position:0%
be held in uh it would seem like this
 
05:21:27.590 --> 05:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
ought to be within five days of the
 
05:21:27.600 --> 05:21:28.708 align:start position:0%
ought to be within five days of the
election

05:21:28.708 --> 05:21:28.718 align:start position:0%
election
 
05:21:31.510 --> 05:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
occurring well I I think I I would I
 
05:21:33.310 --> 05:21:33.320 align:start position:0%
think I would disagree that most towns
 
05:21:34.310 --> 05:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
know where they're going to where
 
05:21:35.948 --> 05:21:35.958 align:start position:0%
they're going to hold the election and
 
05:21:38.590 --> 05:21:38.600 align:start position:0%
mostly it has to do with a uh an
 
05:21:40.150 --> 05:21:40.160 align:start position:0%
assessment of you know it's an offe
 
05:21:43.310 --> 05:21:43.320 align:start position:0%
election or if they have a particularly
 
05:21:46.948 --> 05:21:46.958 align:start position:0%
contentious issue on the local ballot
 
05:21:49.190 --> 05:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
and we had that case anoun it a number
 
05:21:52.110 --> 05:21:52.120 align:start position:0%
of years ago where uh what was driving
 
05:21:57.390 --> 05:21:57.400 align:start position:0%
the turna was a totally uh local issue
 
05:21:59.230 --> 05:21:59.240 align:start position:0%
and the town realized that well in
 
05:22:03.788 --> 05:22:03.798 align:start position:0%
advance and uh changed the location uh
 
05:22:05.750 --> 05:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
so I don't think that that's a
 
05:22:08.070 --> 05:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
particular issue unless you know of some
 
05:22:08.080 --> 05:22:09.548 align:start position:0%
particular issue unless you know of some
specific

05:22:09.548 --> 05:22:09.558 align:start position:0%
specific
 
05:22:12.350 --> 05:22:12.360 align:start position:0%
example so they usually know well in
 
05:22:14.868 --> 05:22:14.878 align:start position:0%
advance where they're going to hold the
 
05:22:16.990 --> 05:22:17.000 align:start position:0%
election I can actually name example
 
05:22:18.310 --> 05:22:18.320 align:start position:0%
represented gusowski when he ran into
 
05:22:19.590 --> 05:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
his special we didn't know where the
 
05:22:21.670 --> 05:22:21.680 align:start position:0%
voting location was going to be um so it
 
05:22:23.708 --> 05:22:23.718 align:start position:0%
actually it actually does happen uh
 
05:22:25.750 --> 05:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
represent Nome thank you thank you for
 
05:22:27.868 --> 05:22:27.878 align:start position:0%
taking the question um do you think that
 
05:22:29.948 --> 05:22:29.958 align:start position:0%
the Thousand fine will have a chilling
 
05:22:32.470 --> 05:22:32.480 align:start position:0%
effect on people running for moderator
 
05:22:34.868 --> 05:22:34.878 align:start position:0%
now and I discussed this with uh When I
 
05:22:36.670 --> 05:22:36.680 align:start position:0%
Was preparing the bill and doing my
 
05:22:39.910 --> 05:22:39.920 align:start position:0%
homework so uh um the reason that's in
 
05:22:41.670 --> 05:22:41.680 align:start position:0%
there one of the things and and from
 
05:22:43.310 --> 05:22:43.320 align:start position:0%
experience and I I won't go into a lot
 
05:22:44.948 --> 05:22:44.958 align:start position:0%
of the detail one of the things as
 
05:22:47.150 --> 05:22:47.160 align:start position:0%
legislators that we have to be conscious
 
05:22:49.430 --> 05:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
of when we write legislation and i' I've
 
05:22:51.990 --> 05:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
run into this numerous times we pass the
 
05:22:54.230 --> 05:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
legislation we don't
 
05:22:57.470 --> 05:22:57.480 align:start position:0%
specify uh either what the penalty you
 
05:22:59.788 --> 05:22:59.798 align:start position:0%
know have a penalty provision in the law
 
05:23:02.590 --> 05:23:02.600 align:start position:0%
and then furthermore we don't specify
 
05:23:06.110 --> 05:23:06.120 align:start position:0%
who's responsible for enforcement and so
 
05:23:09.110 --> 05:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
when I was going through with the uh
 
05:23:11.628 --> 05:23:11.638 align:start position:0%
uh what is it the office office of uh
 
05:23:14.070 --> 05:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
legislative services or whatever the
 
05:23:17.350 --> 05:23:17.360 align:start position:0%
suggestion was that the and that by the
 
05:23:21.390 --> 05:23:21.400 align:start position:0%
way the language says up to a thousand
 
05:23:25.230 --> 05:23:25.240 align:start position:0%
and so my my uh expectation is is that
 
05:23:27.910 --> 05:23:27.920 align:start position:0%
there would be discretion exercised and
 
05:23:30.230 --> 05:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
you know normally I wouldn't I wouldn't
 
05:23:32.310 --> 05:23:32.320 align:start position:0%
think you'd run into a situation where
 
05:23:35.788 --> 05:23:35.798 align:start position:0%
you'd be required to have the uh
 
05:23:38.788 --> 05:23:38.798 align:start position:0%
penalty U enforced unless it was really
 
05:23:41.150 --> 05:23:41.160 align:start position:0%
an egregious situation and I think I
 
05:23:44.150 --> 05:23:44.160 align:start position:0%
would rely on the Judgment of uh people
 
05:23:46.270 --> 05:23:46.280 align:start position:0%
enforcing this provision to be sensible
 
05:23:49.230 --> 05:23:49.240 align:start position:0%
about it so it doesn't specify that it
 
05:23:51.310 --> 05:23:51.320 align:start position:0%
would be a thousand it says up to and
 
05:23:53.830 --> 05:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
that's all the way from zero uh you know
 
05:23:57.110 --> 05:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
to sorting it out uh amicably without a
 
05:24:00.150 --> 05:24:00.160 align:start position:0%
fine to any m in between zero and a
 
05:24:04.230 --> 05:24:04.240 align:start position:0%
thousand so I don't think it uh um
 
05:24:06.350 --> 05:24:06.360 align:start position:0%
necessarily has a chilling effect but it
 
05:24:09.230 --> 05:24:09.240 align:start position:0%
does have a provision in there that uh
 
05:24:12.390 --> 05:24:12.400 align:start position:0%
says hey um you know you can ignore you
 
05:24:15.510 --> 05:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
can ignore the law and not have any
 
05:24:18.990 --> 05:24:19.000 align:start position:0%
consequence does that answer your
 
05:24:22.708 --> 05:24:22.718 align:start position:0%
question it does but it's still a major
 
05:24:24.788 --> 05:24:24.798 align:start position:0%
concern of mine that's all as a as
 
05:24:26.030 --> 05:24:26.040 align:start position:0%
somebody who's been a school moderator
 
05:24:28.110 --> 05:24:28.120 align:start position:0%
for 10 years this would have a chilling
 
05:24:31.150 --> 05:24:31.160 align:start position:0%
effect on me and I would ALS well it's
 
05:24:32.788 --> 05:24:32.798 align:start position:0%
not a I don't have a question there
 
05:24:34.910 --> 05:24:34.920 align:start position:0%
sorry sorry chair it's it's school
 
05:24:39.590 --> 05:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
vacation week things are happening um
 
05:24:41.350 --> 05:24:41.360 align:start position:0%
uh you know I'm taking questions from
 
05:24:41.360 --> 05:24:43.270 align:start position:0%
uh you know I'm taking questions from
the

05:24:43.270 --> 05:24:43.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:24:46.350 --> 05:24:46.360 align:start position:0%
there um further questions from the
 
05:24:48.628 --> 05:24:48.638 align:start position:0%
committee oh see that was you I don't
 
05:24:51.910 --> 05:24:51.920 align:start position:0%
know that was you um seeing done thank
 
05:24:53.948 --> 05:24:53.958 align:start position:0%
you uh next up is representative Timothy
 
05:24:53.958 --> 05:25:15.548 align:start position:0%
you uh next up is representative Timothy
Horan

05:25:15.548 --> 05:25:15.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:16.948 --> 05:25:16.958 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I'm represent
 
05:25:19.070 --> 05:25:19.080 align:start position:0%
Timothy Horus Rafford County District 10
 
05:25:21.910 --> 05:25:21.920 align:start position:0%
and actually this is the uh last bill
 
05:25:23.788 --> 05:25:23.798 align:start position:0%
I'm planing the testify in you probably
 
05:25:25.430 --> 05:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
like see more than more than enough for
 
05:25:26.910 --> 05:25:26.920 align:start position:0%
me but I always enjoy coming to election
 
05:25:29.110 --> 05:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
law this was my first committee I served
 
05:25:33.030 --> 05:25:33.040 align:start position:0%
on uh now ninth I like now in my ninth
 
05:25:35.390 --> 05:25:35.400 align:start position:0%
term actually hard to time time flies
 
05:25:38.430 --> 05:25:38.440 align:start position:0%
when you're having fun but anyway the
 
05:25:41.708 --> 05:25:41.718 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure the anecdote about R nalo
 
05:25:43.470 --> 05:25:43.480 align:start position:0%
being told he had to be a th feet away
 
05:25:45.910 --> 05:25:45.920 align:start position:0%
from the Ping place that coincidentally
 
05:25:48.830 --> 05:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
is uh the radius specified in the
 
05:25:51.110 --> 05:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
federal gunfree schools act so I don't
 
05:25:53.110 --> 05:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
know whether that anything to do why the
 
05:25:57.708 --> 05:25:57.718 align:start position:0%
moderate okay um so that's that may or
 
05:25:59.110 --> 05:25:59.120 align:start position:0%
may not have anything anything to do
 
05:26:01.230 --> 05:26:01.240 align:start position:0%
with it um probably if you want to look
 
05:26:02.750 --> 05:26:02.760 align:start position:0%
at that andic do it more detail you
 
05:26:04.110 --> 05:26:04.120 align:start position:0%
probably to have a work session and try
 
05:26:06.230 --> 05:26:06.240 align:start position:0%
to sort out exactly what it is that the
 
05:26:08.030 --> 05:26:08.040 align:start position:0%
moderator said if you can figure it out
 
05:26:12.310 --> 05:26:12.320 align:start position:0%
and but um this issue been near dear to
 
05:26:15.430 --> 05:26:15.440 align:start position:0%
my heart well recently because I had the
 
05:26:18.310 --> 05:26:18.320 align:start position:0%
gunfree poing place bill which was uh
 
05:26:20.390 --> 05:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
turned down well basically on party
 
05:26:22.310 --> 05:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
lines a few Democrat five Democrats
 
05:26:24.948 --> 05:26:24.958 align:start position:0%
crossed over and uh so it went down
 
05:26:28.510 --> 05:26:28.520 align:start position:0%
to ignominious defeat and um did not go
 
05:26:30.310 --> 05:26:30.320 align:start position:0%
to this committee but rather criminal
 
05:26:32.750 --> 05:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
justice so that's uh that's a subject
 
05:26:34.750 --> 05:26:34.760 align:start position:0%
I've been thinking about hopefully and
 
05:26:37.390 --> 05:26:37.400 align:start position:0%
um in that particular one I limited my
 
05:26:40.590 --> 05:26:40.600 align:start position:0%
bill just to the 100 foot radius
 
05:26:42.350 --> 05:26:42.360 align:start position:0%
traditional 100 foot radius around the
 
05:26:44.190 --> 05:26:44.200 align:start position:0%
Ping place out which is where the
 
05:26:47.270 --> 05:26:47.280 align:start position:0%
electioneering is um not supposed to
 
05:26:48.948 --> 05:26:48.958 align:start position:0%
take place so that's sort been the been
 
05:26:51.910 --> 05:26:51.920 align:start position:0%
the custom and this pill uh one of the
 
05:26:54.110 --> 05:26:54.120 align:start position:0%
reason I did that was just to you know
 
05:26:56.670 --> 05:26:56.680 align:start position:0%
simplify simplify things for gun owners
 
05:26:59.548 --> 05:26:59.558 align:start position:0%
who might even be choosing
 
05:27:02.230 --> 05:27:02.240 align:start position:0%
electioneer um it is you do occasionally
 
05:27:03.990 --> 05:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
see a candidate who feels the need to
 
05:27:06.910 --> 05:27:06.920 align:start position:0%
open carry his fire his or her firearm
 
05:27:08.990 --> 05:27:09.000 align:start position:0%
at the poing place which luckily doesn't
 
05:27:10.670 --> 05:27:10.680 align:start position:0%
happen too often because it
 
05:27:13.190 --> 05:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
really doesn't gain you any votes you
 
05:27:15.350 --> 05:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
know you you you probably can only lose
 
05:27:17.590 --> 05:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
votes by like wearing a gun in a place
 
05:27:19.670 --> 05:27:19.680 align:start position:0%
where people you might have some voters
 
05:27:21.548 --> 05:27:21.558 align:start position:0%
who don't like their candidate open
 
05:27:22.868 --> 05:27:22.878 align:start position:0%
carrying a gun at a place where you
 
05:27:24.548 --> 05:27:24.558 align:start position:0%
usually don't see guns such as at the
 
05:27:27.948 --> 05:27:27.958 align:start position:0%
local school so that's um and that's
 
05:27:29.030 --> 05:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
something a
 
05:27:31.070 --> 05:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
moderator might actually need to think
 
05:27:32.270 --> 05:27:32.280 align:start position:0%
about that might be the moderator
 
05:27:35.510 --> 05:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
certainly threatening or harassing um
 
05:27:38.270 --> 05:27:38.280 align:start position:0%
voters you know shouldn't be allowed at
 
05:27:39.628 --> 05:27:39.638 align:start position:0%
poing place with even with the
 
05:27:41.310 --> 05:27:41.320 align:start position:0%
electioneering era though though I
 
05:27:43.788 --> 05:27:43.798 align:start position:0%
suppose if it's being carried out if the
 
05:27:45.190 --> 05:27:45.200 align:start position:0%
person's wearing a gun then he gets
 
05:27:47.190 --> 05:27:47.200 align:start position:0%
Second Amendment issues so that top of
 
05:27:48.590 --> 05:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
all the First Amendment issues and
 
05:27:52.430 --> 05:27:52.440 align:start position:0%
everything else so U the uh so I I think
 
05:27:54.628 --> 05:27:54.638 align:start position:0%
it looks like this definitely would be
 
05:27:56.350 --> 05:27:56.360 align:start position:0%
an unfunded mandate the cost may be
 
05:27:57.628 --> 05:27:57.638 align:start position:0%
minimal but I think they would be
 
05:27:59.350 --> 05:27:59.360 align:start position:0%
nonzero because they have to draw up
 
05:28:00.948 --> 05:28:00.958 align:start position:0%
this plan they have to post it on the
 
05:28:02.510 --> 05:28:02.520 align:start position:0%
website submitted to the Secretary of
 
05:28:05.070 --> 05:28:05.080 align:start position:0%
State so there is like a finite cost in
 
05:28:06.830 --> 05:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
this they should have an FN even though
 
05:28:09.310 --> 05:28:09.320 align:start position:0%
probably would have said minimal or are
 
05:28:11.868 --> 05:28:11.878 align:start position:0%
indeterminable so that's one reason not
 
05:28:13.590 --> 05:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
to do it and apparently now you would
 
05:28:15.750 --> 05:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
only be able to like sign hold and do
 
05:28:18.470 --> 05:28:18.480 align:start position:0%
other leering activities within that
 
05:28:20.948 --> 05:28:20.958 align:start position:0%
defined area where now you can do it
 
05:28:23.110 --> 05:28:23.120 align:start position:0%
anywhere in the general vicinity of the
 
05:28:25.030 --> 05:28:25.040 align:start position:0%
polling place as long as not within the
 
05:28:28.030 --> 05:28:28.040 align:start position:0%
specified radius which is usually pretty
 
05:28:30.750 --> 05:28:30.760 align:start position:0%
clearly designated by signs on either
 
05:28:32.670 --> 05:28:32.680 align:start position:0%
side of the entrances to the poing place
 
05:28:34.868 --> 05:28:34.878 align:start position:0%
so it's usually pretty easy to figure
 
05:28:37.350 --> 05:28:37.360 align:start position:0%
out where you can electioneer and where
 
05:28:38.990 --> 05:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
you can't
 
05:28:40.948 --> 05:28:40.958 align:start position:0%
actually with my gun guns at the polling
 
05:28:41.990 --> 05:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
place belill that was one of the
 
05:28:43.868 --> 05:28:43.878 align:start position:0%
considerations behind I was trying to
 
05:28:47.430 --> 05:28:47.440 align:start position:0%
craft it so that the gun owner
 
05:28:50.230 --> 05:28:50.240 align:start position:0%
presumably he may or may not he or she
 
05:28:53.350 --> 05:28:53.360 align:start position:0%
may not be aware that it's election day
 
05:28:54.830 --> 05:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
but if they do wand near the polling
 
05:28:56.310 --> 05:28:56.320 align:start position:0%
place they should be able to see the
 
05:28:57.910 --> 05:28:57.920 align:start position:0%
signs they should also be able to see
 
05:28:59.510 --> 05:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
the candidates and other individuals
 
05:29:02.310 --> 05:29:02.320 align:start position:0%
standing 101 ft from the doors so that
 
05:29:03.910 --> 05:29:03.920 align:start position:0%
should be a sign that they're just
 
05:29:05.510 --> 05:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
trying to prevent them from wandering
 
05:29:08.350 --> 05:29:08.360 align:start position:0%
you know into the uh polling place say
 
05:29:11.270 --> 05:29:11.280 align:start position:0%
to find in that bill so I I so I think
 
05:29:13.708 --> 05:29:13.718 align:start position:0%
the existing law existing law is pretty
 
05:29:15.310 --> 05:29:15.320 align:start position:0%
clear on like where you can hold your
 
05:29:16.948 --> 05:29:16.958 align:start position:0%
signs where you can try to talk to the
 
05:29:16.958 --> 05:29:18.110 align:start position:0%
signs where you can try to talk to the
voters

05:29:18.110 --> 05:29:18.120 align:start position:0%
voters
 
05:29:19.948 --> 05:29:19.958 align:start position:0%
although I don't know about rident
 
05:29:22.030 --> 05:29:22.040 align:start position:0%
navalo I find the voters are usually
 
05:29:24.350 --> 05:29:24.360 align:start position:0%
happy to talk usually happy to see the
 
05:29:25.590 --> 05:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
candidates regardless of where they're
 
05:29:26.788 --> 05:29:26.798 align:start position:0%
voting for them but I don't really know
 
05:29:28.750 --> 05:29:28.760 align:start position:0%
if there's a whole lot of uh
 
05:29:31.390 --> 05:29:31.400 align:start position:0%
debating substance of debating going on
 
05:29:33.350 --> 05:29:33.360 align:start position:0%
I don't think that many people are that
 
05:29:34.910 --> 05:29:34.920 align:start position:0%
many voters are making their decision
 
05:29:37.590 --> 05:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
based on what the candidate says while
 
05:29:39.110 --> 05:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
they're like like walking into the
 
05:29:40.948 --> 05:29:40.958 align:start position:0%
polling place I think they've usually
 
05:29:42.788 --> 05:29:42.798 align:start position:0%
decided who they're going to vote for
 
05:29:44.910 --> 05:29:44.920 align:start position:0%
before they get out of the parking lot
 
05:29:46.868 --> 05:29:46.878 align:start position:0%
and start walking to polling place I
 
05:29:48.708 --> 05:29:48.718 align:start position:0%
might also add a lot of people like seem
 
05:29:50.830 --> 05:29:50.840 align:start position:0%
to detour around us so they there's some
 
05:29:52.350 --> 05:29:52.360 align:start position:0%
people just don't want to talk to us at
 
05:29:55.070 --> 05:29:55.080 align:start position:0%
all so so I don't think that's really a
 
05:29:57.548 --> 05:29:57.558 align:start position:0%
big part of it's something you should be
 
05:29:58.948 --> 05:29:58.958 align:start position:0%
able to do it's part of the campaign I
 
05:30:00.190 --> 05:30:00.200 align:start position:0%
don't think that's like a huge part of
 
05:30:02.150 --> 05:30:02.160 align:start position:0%
the campaign so if you're relying on
 
05:30:03.868 --> 05:30:03.878 align:start position:0%
like your conversations with the voters
 
05:30:05.310 --> 05:30:05.320 align:start position:0%
at the polling place to convince them to
 
05:30:07.270 --> 05:30:07.280 align:start position:0%
vote for you I think probably you
 
05:30:08.750 --> 05:30:08.760 align:start position:0%
started your camp campaign a little bit
 
05:30:12.750 --> 05:30:12.760 align:start position:0%
too late but um so that's uh I I'm
 
05:30:14.230 --> 05:30:14.240 align:start position:0%
worried about you know just sort of
 
05:30:14.240 --> 05:30:15.628 align:start position:0%
worried about you know just sort of
designating

05:30:15.628 --> 05:30:15.638 align:start position:0%
designating
 
05:30:18.590 --> 05:30:18.600 align:start position:0%
a circumscribed area and then apparently
 
05:30:20.590 --> 05:30:20.600 align:start position:0%
you can't election ear outside of that
 
05:30:23.110 --> 05:30:23.120 align:start position:0%
and also I'm going to say that criminal
 
05:30:24.548 --> 05:30:24.558 align:start position:0%
penalty that's a pretty excessive
 
05:30:26.750 --> 05:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
criminal penalty and it seems to apply
 
05:30:28.830 --> 05:30:28.840 align:start position:0%
not just as the moderator but like seem
 
05:30:31.310 --> 05:30:31.320 align:start position:0%
to other people apparently we could he's
 
05:30:33.310 --> 05:30:33.320 align:start position:0%
a very nice man I'd hate to like uh he
 
05:30:34.788 --> 05:30:34.798 align:start position:0%
certainly doesn't deserve be prosecuted
 
05:30:36.590 --> 05:30:36.600 align:start position:0%
apparently you could try to prosecute
 
05:30:38.990 --> 05:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State you or even a
 
05:30:41.750 --> 05:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
candidate or whoever else so that's
 
05:30:43.548 --> 05:30:43.558 align:start position:0%
criminal criminal penalty is pretty
 
05:30:45.750 --> 05:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
excessive so I would I would say this
 
05:30:48.270 --> 05:30:48.280 align:start position:0%
bill is unnecessary our polling our
 
05:30:51.390 --> 05:30:51.400 align:start position:0%
polling places are uh re reasonably
 
05:30:53.548 --> 05:30:53.558 align:start position:0%
orderly and I think it actually creates
 
05:30:55.670 --> 05:30:55.680 align:start position:0%
less space for you to hold your signs
 
05:30:57.310 --> 05:30:57.320 align:start position:0%
talk to the voters and do all the things
 
05:30:59.190 --> 05:30:59.200 align:start position:0%
people like to do on Election Day so I
 
05:31:02.628 --> 05:31:02.638 align:start position:0%
would say advis an itl that bill and um
 
05:31:04.868 --> 05:31:04.878 align:start position:0%
so that's that's what I have to say and
 
05:31:06.390 --> 05:31:06.400 align:start position:0%
you're done with me for the day so you
 
05:31:07.948 --> 05:31:07.958 align:start position:0%
enjoy the rest of the afternoon without
 
05:31:09.990 --> 05:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
me and if you want to take any if you
 
05:31:11.548 --> 05:31:11.558 align:start position:0%
want to ask ask me any questions I can
 
05:31:13.510 --> 05:31:13.520 align:start position:0%
try to answer them or questions from the
 
05:31:16.150 --> 05:31:16.160 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you uh next
 
05:31:17.510 --> 05:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
up is Senator Tim
 
05:31:24.110 --> 05:31:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:28.510 --> 05:31:28.520 align:start position:0%
law thank Mr chairman nice to see you
 
05:31:31.548 --> 05:31:31.558 align:start position:0%
all thanks for working on the vacation
 
05:31:34.548 --> 05:31:34.558 align:start position:0%
week keeping such an aggressive schedule
 
05:31:38.670 --> 05:31:38.680 align:start position:0%
my first appearance here in election law
 
05:31:40.150 --> 05:31:40.160 align:start position:0%
I have some written testimony which I'll
 
05:31:42.990 --> 05:31:43.000 align:start position:0%
hand in but I don't think I'll read it
 
05:31:45.390 --> 05:31:45.400 align:start position:0%
um kind of a numbers guy so I'll just
 
05:31:47.150 --> 05:31:47.160 align:start position:0%
talk to you a little bit about first of
 
05:31:49.548 --> 05:31:49.558 align:start position:0%
all I'm Senator Tim MCU from marac I
 
05:31:51.750 --> 05:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
represent District 11 marac Milford
 
05:31:54.110 --> 05:31:54.120 align:start position:0%
amist and Wilton and I haven't been
 
05:31:56.868 --> 05:31:56.878 align:start position:0%
through nearly as many elections as many
 
05:32:00.990 --> 05:32:01.000 align:start position:0%
of you but after 10 elections over 29
 
05:32:04.430 --> 05:32:04.440 align:start position:0%
years I've had the first six had one or
 
05:32:06.510 --> 05:32:06.520 align:start position:0%
two polling places it varied a little
 
05:32:09.830 --> 05:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
bit the next two had three polling
 
05:32:12.830 --> 05:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
places and the next one had six over 14
 
05:32:15.430 --> 05:32:15.440 align:start position:0%
hours so as you can see it kind of
 
05:32:18.350 --> 05:32:18.360 align:start position:0%
varies a bit and at each one of those uh
 
05:32:19.470 --> 05:32:19.480 align:start position:0%
well the
 
05:32:23.990 --> 05:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
first nine had the same moderator at the
 
05:32:25.230 --> 05:32:25.240 align:start position:0%
main polling
 
05:32:28.390 --> 05:32:28.400 align:start position:0%
place and the story was always uh that's
 
05:32:31.030 --> 05:32:31.040 align:start position:0%
always the way we've done things until
 
05:32:33.270 --> 05:32:33.280 align:start position:0%
somebody came up and which was okay it
 
05:32:35.948 --> 05:32:35.958 align:start position:0%
was nice to have a bit of consistency
 
05:32:38.708 --> 05:32:38.718 align:start position:0%
but local knowledge and knowledge of the
 
05:32:40.590 --> 05:32:40.600 align:start position:0%
the history books was everything until
 
05:32:42.910 --> 05:32:42.920 align:start position:0%
you tried to have a bit of a creative
 
05:32:45.390 --> 05:32:45.400 align:start position:0%
Twist on how things uh how you might
 
05:32:47.070 --> 05:32:47.080 align:start position:0%
campaign or
 
05:32:50.470 --> 05:32:50.480 align:start position:0%
electioneer um and then there was a need
 
05:32:56.030 --> 05:32:56.040 align:start position:0%
for some rules to be set forth and to me
 
05:32:58.110 --> 05:32:58.120 align:start position:0%
it never mattered what the specific
 
05:33:00.350 --> 05:33:00.360 align:start position:0%
rules were as long as they were
 
05:33:03.030 --> 05:33:03.040 align:start position:0%
communicated effectively in
 
05:33:06.470 --> 05:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
advance stayed the same during the
 
05:33:08.310 --> 05:33:08.320 align:start position:0%
campaign and the polling place and the
 
05:33:10.510 --> 05:33:10.520 align:start position:0%
Ping place and were equally equally
 
05:33:13.590 --> 05:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
enforced and that was often the problem
 
05:33:15.628 --> 05:33:15.638 align:start position:0%
was that you know deciding on them and
 
05:33:18.070 --> 05:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
and communicating them
 
05:33:21.548 --> 05:33:21.558 align:start position:0%
until uh our moderator distributed a
 
05:33:24.990 --> 05:33:25.000 align:start position:0%
schematic diagram so much to my surprise
 
05:33:28.628 --> 05:33:28.638 align:start position:0%
in this bill there is a call for that um
 
05:33:30.868 --> 05:33:30.878 align:start position:0%
I've read through and secretary scandin
 
05:33:32.750 --> 05:33:32.760 align:start position:0%
knows we've had numerous discussions on
 
05:33:35.990 --> 05:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
this topic over the last three or four
 
05:33:38.270 --> 05:33:38.280 align:start position:0%
years um
 
05:33:40.788 --> 05:33:40.798 align:start position:0%
I've read through the lengthy moderator
 
05:33:42.990 --> 05:33:43.000 align:start position:0%
manual which is very very thorough and
 
05:33:44.990 --> 05:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
excellent excellent guide for our
 
05:33:46.948 --> 05:33:46.958 align:start position:0%
moderators who have an incredible amount
 
05:33:49.910 --> 05:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
of power uh and an incredible amount of
 
05:33:51.830 --> 05:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
responsibility and and in my opinion by
 
05:33:55.350 --> 05:33:55.360 align:start position:0%
and large do an amazing job dealing with
 
05:33:57.628 --> 05:33:57.638 align:start position:0%
Incredible you know very w a wide
 
05:34:00.628 --> 05:34:00.638 align:start position:0%
variety of situations and I think that's
 
05:34:02.948 --> 05:34:02.958 align:start position:0%
part of what makes it difficult to
 
05:34:05.030 --> 05:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
legislate some of these requirements
 
05:34:06.910 --> 05:34:06.920 align:start position:0%
because every polling place is different
 
05:34:08.590 --> 05:34:08.600 align:start position:0%
and you pulling out hours are different
 
05:34:12.230 --> 05:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
and you know Wilton Town Hall is Tiny
 
05:34:15.190 --> 05:34:15.200 align:start position:0%
and marac has three polling places and
 
05:34:17.030 --> 05:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
so you things are things are different
 
05:34:18.510 --> 05:34:18.520 align:start position:0%
so moderators have to have sound
 
05:34:20.030 --> 05:34:20.040 align:start position:0%
judgment and that's why they're elected
 
05:34:21.708 --> 05:34:21.718 align:start position:0%
and they have to have the
 
05:34:25.670 --> 05:34:25.680 align:start position:0%
flexibility but and here's the butt um
 
05:34:27.548 --> 05:34:27.558 align:start position:0%
candidates like we heard we've heard in
 
05:34:29.548 --> 05:34:29.558 align:start position:0%
tes mod and we all know uh candidates
 
05:34:33.590 --> 05:34:33.600 align:start position:0%
come and go and there's 30 30% turnover
 
05:34:35.510 --> 05:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
so there isn't always that local
 
05:34:37.350 --> 05:34:37.360 align:start position:0%
knowledge you don't you don't always
 
05:34:39.628 --> 05:34:39.638 align:start position:0%
know exactly what the rules are so the
 
05:34:42.350 --> 05:34:42.360 align:start position:0%
ability to look at a schematic know
 
05:34:43.830 --> 05:34:43.840 align:start position:0%
where you're supposed to stand how
 
05:34:45.788 --> 05:34:45.798 align:start position:0%
you're allowed or not allowed to engage
 
05:34:48.948 --> 05:34:48.958 align:start position:0%
a voter so you can plan in advance and
 
05:34:51.830 --> 05:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
everybody has that Level Playing Field
 
05:34:54.868 --> 05:34:54.878 align:start position:0%
would be tremendously helpful and fair
 
05:34:57.548 --> 05:34:57.558 align:start position:0%
and frankly it's just common sense so if
 
05:35:00.390 --> 05:35:00.400 align:start position:0%
if you know you can set up the day
 
05:35:02.990 --> 05:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
before or you know you can't set up
 
05:35:03.000 --> 05:35:04.628 align:start position:0%
before or you know you can't set up
until

05:35:04.628 --> 05:35:04.638 align:start position:0%
until
 
05:35:06.990 --> 05:35:07.000 align:start position:0%
5:59 a.m. when the polling place opens
 
05:35:09.150 --> 05:35:09.160 align:start position:0%
at 6 fair is fair everybody's on a Level
 
05:35:11.628 --> 05:35:11.638 align:start position:0%
Playing Field that's that's that's okay
 
05:35:13.910 --> 05:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
that's perfectly fine so I think that's
 
05:35:17.910 --> 05:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
what this bill attempts to do um and
 
05:35:20.270 --> 05:35:20.280 align:start position:0%
there's a I'll call it a companion bill
 
05:35:23.150 --> 05:35:23.160 align:start position:0%
it's Senate Bill 216 which I hope I'll
 
05:35:24.788 --> 05:35:24.798 align:start position:0%
get a chance to present to you I've got
 
05:35:26.350 --> 05:35:26.360 align:start position:0%
to make it through the other body first
 
05:35:27.948 --> 05:35:27.958 align:start position:0%
but myself and six of my Senate
 
05:35:30.230 --> 05:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
colleagues and a couple of house members
 
05:35:32.628 --> 05:35:32.638 align:start position:0%
have co-sponsored that um so I will
 
05:35:35.510 --> 05:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
suggest that you consider some of that
 
05:35:38.590 --> 05:35:38.600 align:start position:0%
language as well uh it's the same same
 
05:35:41.150 --> 05:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
topic um it doesn't include a schematic
 
05:35:44.310 --> 05:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
but it does attempt to clarify two other
 
05:35:47.548 --> 05:35:47.558 align:start position:0%
vague issues not only um but it has it
 
05:35:48.590 --> 05:35:48.600 align:start position:0%
has to do with the electioneering
 
05:35:50.150 --> 05:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
Corridor specifically how far does it
 
05:35:52.548 --> 05:35:52.558 align:start position:0%
extend and when does control of that
 
05:35:54.868 --> 05:35:54.878 align:start position:0%
Corridor start there's two bit of two
 
05:35:57.590 --> 05:35:57.600 align:start position:0%
bits of vague language one is what is
 
05:36:01.830 --> 05:36:01.840 align:start position:0%
prior to um is it in fact does this
 
05:36:04.430 --> 05:36:04.440 align:start position:0%
start now you know we have a couple of
 
05:36:06.590 --> 05:36:06.600 align:start position:0%
elections coming up so does the
 
05:36:09.590 --> 05:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
moderator control it now I mean it is
 
05:36:09.600 --> 05:36:10.788 align:start position:0%
moderator control it now I mean it is
prior

05:36:10.788 --> 05:36:10.798 align:start position:0%
prior
 
05:36:14.430 --> 05:36:14.440 align:start position:0%
to so um or or is it midnight the night
 
05:36:16.390 --> 05:36:16.400 align:start position:0%
before or is it one minute
 
05:36:19.390 --> 05:36:19.400 align:start position:0%
before and what all what
 
05:36:24.430 --> 05:36:24.440 align:start position:0%
defines ATT what defines attending your
 
05:36:24.440 --> 05:36:25.830 align:start position:0%
defines ATT what defines attending your
constitutionally

05:36:25.830 --> 05:36:25.840 align:start position:0%
constitutionally
 
05:36:28.310 --> 05:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
protected Free Speech or your political
 
05:36:30.628 --> 05:36:30.638 align:start position:0%
communication so in statute we defined
 
05:36:32.590 --> 05:36:32.600 align:start position:0%
we Define political speech or
 
05:36:34.788 --> 05:36:34.798 align:start position:0%
communication you know uh what I'm
 
05:36:37.150 --> 05:36:37.160 align:start position:0%
getting at is a sign a yard sign we've
 
05:36:38.750 --> 05:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
all I know you've heard this discussion
 
05:36:41.990 --> 05:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
about holding a sign or a totem or a
 
05:36:45.510 --> 05:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
sign on a stick or a sign printed on a
 
05:36:48.350 --> 05:36:48.360 align:start position:0%
tent I could relate to you um some of
 
05:36:52.230 --> 05:36:52.240 align:start position:0%
the evolving rules that we had uh when I
 
05:36:54.430 --> 05:36:54.440 align:start position:0%
think I might have been the first in
 
05:36:56.990 --> 05:36:57.000 align:start position:0%
1998 to purchase one of those easy up
 
05:36:59.230 --> 05:36:59.240 align:start position:0%
tents from Sam's Club and put it and
 
05:37:00.750 --> 05:37:00.760 align:start position:0%
then we had a rule about whether you
 
05:37:01.990 --> 05:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
could or couldn't have tents and then
 
05:37:03.590 --> 05:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
tents became fashionable then we had a
 
05:37:03.600 --> 05:37:04.390 align:start position:0%
tents became fashionable then we had a
tent

05:37:04.390 --> 05:37:04.400 align:start position:0%
tent
 
05:37:06.628 --> 05:37:06.638 align:start position:0%
Lottery we literally had a tent Lottery
 
05:37:07.948 --> 05:37:07.958 align:start position:0%
and that worked out fairly well then we
 
05:37:09.830 --> 05:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
got rid of the tent Lottery then we had
 
05:37:11.910 --> 05:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
a draw you know we had a drawing but the
 
05:37:14.030 --> 05:37:14.040 align:start position:0%
most successful I think our candidates
 
05:37:16.628 --> 05:37:16.638 align:start position:0%
will tell you the most successful four
 
05:37:18.670 --> 05:37:18.680 align:start position:0%
elections were those where we everybody
 
05:37:20.150 --> 05:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
knew where they had to be and when they
 
05:37:22.230 --> 05:37:22.240 align:start position:0%
could be there that was just fair you
 
05:37:25.670 --> 05:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
could plan um and it didn't change but
 
05:37:28.350 --> 05:37:28.360 align:start position:0%
anyhow uh back to the the attending of
 
05:37:30.390 --> 05:37:30.400 align:start position:0%
signs so you have a nice sign here thank
 
05:37:32.788 --> 05:37:32.798 align:start position:0%
you for putting that up I was able to uh
 
05:37:34.110 --> 05:37:34.120 align:start position:0%
sit across the street and know exactly
 
05:37:35.230 --> 05:37:35.240 align:start position:0%
what Billy were on so I really
 
05:37:37.670 --> 05:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
appreciate that but I'll ask you am I
 
05:37:41.430 --> 05:37:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:44.390 --> 05:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
now I'm not oh so in the opinion of the
 
05:37:45.990 --> 05:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
chair I'm currently not attending this
 
05:37:48.708 --> 05:37:48.718 align:start position:0%
sign because I'm not touching it so now
 
05:37:50.350 --> 05:37:50.360 align:start position:0%
I'm attending it now I'm attending it
 
05:37:52.470 --> 05:37:52.480 align:start position:0%
that's interesting so but in the opinion
 
05:37:54.830 --> 05:37:54.840 align:start position:0%
of some moderators I am absolutely
 
05:37:58.430 --> 05:37:58.440 align:start position:0%
attending this sign because I'm six feet
 
05:38:01.310 --> 05:38:01.320 align:start position:0%
away um but representative kosovski
 
05:38:02.788 --> 05:38:02.798 align:start position:0%
would not be attending the sign because
 
05:38:04.868 --> 05:38:04.878 align:start position:0%
he's too far away you get the idea how
 
05:38:07.948 --> 05:38:07.958 align:start position:0%
far is too far like and that's that's
 
05:38:11.470 --> 05:38:11.480 align:start position:0%
the the difference in in every case at
 
05:38:13.270 --> 05:38:13.280 align:start position:0%
the six polling places during my last
 
05:38:15.510 --> 05:38:15.520 align:start position:0%
election I would absolutely be attending
 
05:38:17.470 --> 05:38:17.480 align:start position:0%
that sign I did not have to be
 
05:38:20.190 --> 05:38:20.200 align:start position:0%
physically touching it but I know of at
 
05:38:23.150 --> 05:38:23.160 align:start position:0%
least a half a dozen polling places from
 
05:38:25.150 --> 05:38:25.160 align:start position:0%
uh House and Senate colleagues where you
 
05:38:26.590 --> 05:38:26.600 align:start position:0%
have to be physically touching the sign
 
05:38:28.390 --> 05:38:28.400 align:start position:0%
or you have to lay it down and put it
 
05:38:30.948 --> 05:38:30.958 align:start position:0%
put it down and that's the variance so
 
05:38:32.788 --> 05:38:32.798 align:start position:0%
the other bill that I mentioned attempts
 
05:38:36.150 --> 05:38:36.160 align:start position:0%
to Define attending uh attendance of a
 
05:38:37.868 --> 05:38:37.878 align:start position:0%
sign and the prior to the those two bits
 
05:38:41.110 --> 05:38:41.120 align:start position:0%
of of vagueness um again don't care what
 
05:38:42.628 --> 05:38:42.638 align:start position:0%
the outcome is just care that it is
 
05:38:44.390 --> 05:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
defined and that it's communicated and
 
05:38:45.750 --> 05:38:45.760 align:start position:0%
equally enforced for all parties
 
05:38:48.628 --> 05:38:48.638 align:start position:0%
involved and keeps the field level so
 
05:38:51.110 --> 05:38:51.120 align:start position:0%
those are the things um that I had to
 
05:38:52.670 --> 05:38:52.680 align:start position:0%
say a lot of other states have done this
 
05:38:53.750 --> 05:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
by the way I did do a little bit of
 
05:38:55.910 --> 05:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
research Montana does it uh
 
05:38:58.868 --> 05:38:58.878 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts does it uh let's see uh
 
05:39:01.830 --> 05:39:01.840 align:start position:0%
Arizona Indiana they all have language
 
05:39:04.868 --> 05:39:04.878 align:start position:0%
similar to this I'm not saying we should
 
05:39:07.510 --> 05:39:07.520 align:start position:0%
copycat um you know we are we are do
 
05:39:10.910 --> 05:39:10.920 align:start position:0%
like to be different but I think uh the
 
05:39:12.868 --> 05:39:12.878 align:start position:0%
most important thing is just designate a
 
05:39:16.910 --> 05:39:16.920 align:start position:0%
safe space for candidates and voters to
 
05:39:19.230 --> 05:39:19.240 align:start position:0%
interact equally and safely and
 
05:39:21.910 --> 05:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
everybody knows the rules um and
 
05:39:23.430 --> 05:39:23.440 align:start position:0%
hopefully I'll see you again and I'd
 
05:39:24.868 --> 05:39:24.878 align:start position:0%
love to take questions and and talk to
 
05:39:26.670 --> 05:39:26.680 align:start position:0%
you about any of those things that I
 
05:39:27.708 --> 05:39:27.718 align:start position:0%
talked about if you want to know about
 
05:39:30.750 --> 05:39:30.760 align:start position:0%
tent lotteries um I will say our our new
 
05:39:33.628 --> 05:39:33.638 align:start position:0%
moderator uh Brian McCarthy if you're
 
05:39:36.868 --> 05:39:36.878 align:start position:0%
listening he did chalk Mark I'm glad it
 
05:39:39.548 --> 05:39:39.558 align:start position:0%
didn't rain night but we had some chalk
 
05:39:42.430 --> 05:39:42.440 align:start position:0%
marks the night before that election was
 
05:39:44.150 --> 05:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
absolutely as smooth as it could have
 
05:39:46.150 --> 05:39:46.160 align:start position:0%
gone everybody knew when you could be
 
05:39:47.628 --> 05:39:47.638 align:start position:0%
there where you could be there exactly
 
05:39:49.548 --> 05:39:49.558 align:start position:0%
where you could park your car place your
 
05:39:53.948 --> 05:39:53.958 align:start position:0%
tent and it worked so we and this this
 
05:39:55.468 --> 05:39:55.478 align:start position:0%
and and the diagrams were published too
 
05:39:57.390 --> 05:39:57.400 align:start position:0%
where you could park they were emailed
 
05:39:58.990 --> 05:39:59.000 align:start position:0%
out to everybody but post on a website
 
05:40:00.390 --> 05:40:00.400 align:start position:0%
would be even better because there is a
 
05:40:03.390 --> 05:40:03.400 align:start position:0%
challenge getting uh emails of a
 
05:40:05.990 --> 05:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
candidate especially a new candidate or
 
05:40:08.788 --> 05:40:08.798 align:start position:0%
a candidate's design or representative
 
05:40:11.910 --> 05:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
sometimes those emails just went to the
 
05:40:14.548 --> 05:40:14.558 align:start position:0%
uh the party chair and there's often
 
05:40:16.468 --> 05:40:16.478 align:start position:0%
discussion about you know did it make it
 
05:40:17.868 --> 05:40:17.878 align:start position:0%
then to the specific candidate on the
 
05:40:19.990 --> 05:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
ballot so on a website or publicly
 
05:40:21.310 --> 05:40:21.320 align:start position:0%
available I think would be even better
 
05:40:23.390 --> 05:40:23.400 align:start position:0%
on the uh Secretary of State's website
 
05:40:24.708 --> 05:40:24.718 align:start position:0%
would be even better I know that would
 
05:40:27.948 --> 05:40:27.958 align:start position:0%
be a big burden probably so um happy to
 
05:40:30.390 --> 05:40:30.400 align:start position:0%
take any questions on on this subject
 
05:40:32.430 --> 05:40:32.440 align:start position:0%
other questions from the committee
 
05:40:34.628 --> 05:40:34.638 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you next last up is
 
05:40:48.310 --> 05:40:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:50.070 --> 05:40:50.080 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is Sarah Burke
 
05:40:51.910 --> 05:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
Cohen I represent the New Hampshire
 
05:40:51.920 --> 05:40:53.150 align:start position:0%
Cohen I represent the New Hampshire
Municipal

05:40:53.150 --> 05:40:53.160 align:start position:0%
Municipal
 
05:40:55.430 --> 05:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
Association the New Hampshire Municipal
 
05:40:58.150 --> 05:40:58.160 align:start position:0%
Association opposes this bill um it
 
05:41:01.868 --> 05:41:01.878 align:start position:0%
requires a schematic to be submitted um
 
05:41:05.788 --> 05:41:05.798 align:start position:0%
well in advance of the election day um
 
05:41:07.910 --> 05:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
the nhma sees us as problematic because
 
05:41:11.590 --> 05:41:11.600 align:start position:0%
it takes away the moderator's ability to
 
05:41:15.270 --> 05:41:15.280 align:start position:0%
adjust the area uh based on weather
 
05:41:16.750 --> 05:41:16.760 align:start position:0%
obviously we can see that how that could
 
05:41:18.430 --> 05:41:18.440 align:start position:0%
happen this year with all the snow out
 
05:41:19.948 --> 05:41:19.958 align:start position:0%
there traffic patterns and other
 
05:41:21.510 --> 05:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
conditions on Election Day That Could
 
05:41:24.990 --> 05:41:25.000 align:start position:0%
impact what the space looks like um it
 
05:41:28.190 --> 05:41:28.200 align:start position:0%
also uh requires the area to be marked
 
05:41:30.390 --> 05:41:30.400 align:start position:0%
physically but it doesn't indicate in
 
05:41:33.110 --> 05:41:33.120 align:start position:0%
this bill when that should happen is
 
05:41:35.948 --> 05:41:35.958 align:start position:0%
that when the schematic is submitted is
 
05:41:39.110 --> 05:41:39.120 align:start position:0%
that um on Election Day Before election
 
05:41:41.830 --> 05:41:41.840 align:start position:0%
day some of these um polling places are
 
05:41:43.910 --> 05:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
schools so it could be problematic if
 
05:41:47.310 --> 05:41:47.320 align:start position:0%
you're putting out chalk or um if you're
 
05:41:50.070 --> 05:41:50.080 align:start position:0%
putting out uh you know wooden Stakes to
 
05:41:51.150 --> 05:41:51.160 align:start position:0%
Mark something off it could be
 
05:41:52.788 --> 05:41:52.798 align:start position:0%
problematic if you do do it well in
 
05:41:56.350 --> 05:41:56.360 align:start position:0%
advance to um from election day um so in
 
05:41:58.788 --> 05:41:58.798 align:start position:0%
some this bill raises practical issues
 
05:42:00.708 --> 05:42:00.718 align:start position:0%
that will make implementation burdensome
 
05:42:03.788 --> 05:42:03.798 align:start position:0%
for municipalities um and we urge you to
 
05:42:06.350 --> 05:42:06.360 align:start position:0%
itl this bill um open to questions other
 
05:42:07.708 --> 05:42:07.718 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
05:42:09.788 --> 05:42:09.798 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you thank you um I
 
05:42:11.628 --> 05:42:11.638 align:start position:0%
don't have any more pink cards uh there
 
05:42:13.548 --> 05:42:13.558 align:start position:0%
was no one on the blue sheet signed up
 
05:42:18.628 --> 05:42:18.638 align:start position:0%
that did not speak and online it was uh
 
05:42:20.350 --> 05:42:20.360 align:start position:0%
three support 20 opposed one neutral
 
05:42:21.390 --> 05:42:21.400 align:start position:0%
with that we will close the public
 
05:42:23.628 --> 05:42:23.638 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 333 and open up
 
05:42:25.150 --> 05:42:25.160 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on House Bill 395
 
05:42:27.948 --> 05:42:27.958 align:start position:0%
recognize representative Pam Brown um
 
05:42:29.548 --> 05:42:29.558 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of introduction
 
05:42:34.468 --> 05:42:34.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:37.910 --> 05:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
law R Brown is that written testimony
 
05:42:39.990 --> 05:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
okay can you put that on the desk we
 
05:42:41.070 --> 05:42:41.080 align:start position:0%
don't we don't distribute it because we
 
05:42:43.110 --> 05:42:43.120 align:start position:0%
get so much of it uh we we collect it at
 
05:42:44.110 --> 05:42:44.120 align:start position:0%
the end of the day and it keeps
 
05:42:46.948 --> 05:42:46.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:50.468 --> 05:42:50.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:53.150 --> 05:42:53.160 align:start position:0%
you all right welcome to election law
 
05:42:54.230 --> 05:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
yeah good
 
05:42:56.430 --> 05:42:56.440 align:start position:0%
afternoon Ed funding's downstairs
 
05:42:58.830 --> 05:42:58.840 align:start position:0%
working hard too so lucky
 
05:43:03.548 --> 05:43:03.558 align:start position:0%
yes um so thank you for um hearing my
 
05:43:06.788 --> 05:43:06.798 align:start position:0%
testimony I um have served as a pole
 
05:43:09.590 --> 05:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
worker and I've also done election um
 
05:43:11.070 --> 05:43:11.080 align:start position:0%
challenging in
 
05:43:13.150 --> 05:43:13.160 align:start position:0%
Manchester election Integrity is
 
05:43:16.390 --> 05:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
important for my constituents um I know
 
05:43:19.468 --> 05:43:19.478 align:start position:0%
your committee is addressing things like
 
05:43:22.150 --> 05:43:22.160 align:start position:0%
machinery and vote voter IDs and same
 
05:43:24.868 --> 05:43:24.878 align:start position:0%
day registration but the supervisor of
 
05:43:27.190 --> 05:43:27.200 align:start position:0%
the checklist I think need need greater
 
05:43:30.150 --> 05:43:30.160 align:start position:0%
oversight so I decided to draft a bill
 
05:43:33.948 --> 05:43:33.958 align:start position:0%
the bill simply amends RSA 658 Co 2 to
 
05:43:35.990 --> 05:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
give the inspectors of Elections the
 
05:43:37.948 --> 05:43:37.958 align:start position:0%
power to observe all activities and
 
05:43:40.350 --> 05:43:40.360 align:start position:0%
documents handled by the supervisors of
 
05:43:43.350 --> 05:43:43.360 align:start position:0%
checklists in a town or Ward for those
 
05:43:46.230 --> 05:43:46.240 align:start position:0%
unaware inspectors of elections are pole
 
05:43:47.990 --> 05:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
workers and observers who are appointed

by our two major political parties for
 
05:43:52.190 --> 05:43:52.200 align:start position:0%
two-year terms to assist with and
 
05:43:54.430 --> 05:43:54.440 align:start position:0%
monitor election
 
05:43:56.468 --> 05:43:56.478 align:start position:0%
activities the supervisors of the
 
05:43:59.350 --> 05:43:59.360 align:start position:0%
checklist wield significant power over
 
05:44:01.230 --> 05:44:01.240 align:start position:0%
over voter registration and election
 
05:44:03.070 --> 05:44:03.080 align:start position:0%

05:44:05.030 --> 05:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
maintaining current voter databases
 
05:44:07.468 --> 05:44:07.478 align:start position:0%
meeting regularly for checklist
 
05:44:08.990 --> 05:44:09.000 align:start position:0%

05:44:10.750 --> 05:44:10.760 align:start position:0%
including School District elections and
 
05:44:12.750 --> 05:44:12.760 align:start position:0%
other meetings where checklists are used
 
05:44:14.910 --> 05:44:14.920 align:start position:0%
such as
 
05:44:17.070 --> 05:44:17.080 align:start position:0%
deliberatively um the entire checklist
 
05:44:19.270 --> 05:44:19.280 align:start position:0%
every 10 years and sending notices by
 
05:44:21.310 --> 05:44:21.320 align:start position:0%
mail to the last known addresses of
 
05:44:23.750 --> 05:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
those to be removed removing voter names
 
05:44:25.190 --> 05:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
after receiving change of address
 
05:44:27.070 --> 05:44:27.080 align:start position:0%
reports from the postal service
 
05:44:28.868 --> 05:44:28.878 align:start position:0%
department of safety or Secretary of
 
05:44:30.548 --> 05:44:30.558 align:start position:0%
State removing voter names after
 
05:44:32.590 --> 05:44:32.600 align:start position:0%
receiving notices through the Statewide
 
05:44:34.868 --> 05:44:34.878 align:start position:0%
database that a voter has registered in
 
05:44:38.430 --> 05:44:38.440 align:start position:0%
another state removing voter names after
 
05:44:40.310 --> 05:44:40.320 align:start position:0%
receiving death notices from the clerk's
 
05:44:43.788 --> 05:44:43.798 align:start position:0%
office approving new voters after examin
 
05:44:45.468 --> 05:44:45.478 align:start position:0%
examining documents confirming age

05:44:49.948 --> 05:44:49.958 align:start position:0%
uniformed and overseas citizen absentee
 
05:44:49.958 --> 05:44:51.468 align:start position:0%
uniformed and overseas citizen absentee
voting

05:44:51.468 --> 05:44:51.478 align:start position:0%
voting
 
05:44:54.150 --> 05:44:54.160 align:start position:0%
applications uh you get the idea issuing
 
05:44:56.590 --> 05:44:56.600 align:start position:0%
guidelines and also most importantly
 
05:44:58.390 --> 05:44:58.400 align:start position:0%
promptly reporting to the Secretary of
 
05:45:00.030 --> 05:45:00.040 align:start position:0%
State and attorney general any evidence
 
05:45:02.990 --> 05:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
of voter fraud when it arises and later
 
05:45:04.948 --> 05:45:04.958 align:start position:0%
initiating removal of those persons from
 
05:45:08.070 --> 05:45:08.080 align:start position:0%
the checklist by sending notices
 
05:45:10.110 --> 05:45:10.120 align:start position:0%
so to me the check the supervisors of
 
05:45:11.788 --> 05:45:11.798 align:start position:0%
the checklist are where the rubber meets
 
05:45:13.628 --> 05:45:13.638 align:start position:0%
the road when it comes to election
 
05:45:16.788 --> 05:45:16.798 align:start position:0%
integrity and my bill simply offers a
 
05:45:19.150 --> 05:45:19.160 align:start position:0%
few more sets of pairs of eyes to as a
 
05:45:21.788 --> 05:45:21.798 align:start position:0%
check and a balance on their activities
 
05:45:25.910 --> 05:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
to me this is important because
 
05:45:30.670 --> 05:45:30.680 align:start position:0%
um it's often a a select board uh or a
 
05:45:33.190 --> 05:45:33.200 align:start position:0%
supervisor's board may be composed
 
05:45:35.510 --> 05:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
entirely of individuals belonging to one
 
05:45:37.548 --> 05:45:37.558 align:start position:0%
political party
 
05:45:40.590 --> 05:45:40.600 align:start position:0%
and RSA 654 allows that quote all
 
05:45:42.190 --> 05:45:42.200 align:start position:0%
decisions of the supervisors of the
 
05:45:44.150 --> 05:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
checklist shall be made by a majority
 
05:45:44.160 --> 05:45:45.230 align:start position:0%
checklist shall be made by a majority
vote

05:45:45.230 --> 05:45:45.240 align:start position:0%
vote
 
05:45:48.510 --> 05:45:48.520 align:start position:0%
thereof rather than make the supervisors
 
05:45:50.350 --> 05:45:50.360 align:start position:0%
um a partisan office which I had
 
05:45:53.350 --> 05:45:53.360 align:start position:0%
considered initially uh in I decided
 
05:45:55.708 --> 05:45:55.718 align:start position:0%
giving inspectors of Elections increased
 
05:45:58.468 --> 05:45:58.478 align:start position:0%
oversight seemed the easiest solution I
 
05:46:01.990 --> 05:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
noticed RSA 669 col 7 States no
 
05:46:03.990 --> 05:46:04.000 align:start position:0%
inspector of election shall at the same
 
05:46:05.788 --> 05:46:05.798 align:start position:0%
time serve as a supervisor of the
 
05:46:05.798 --> 05:46:07.830 align:start position:0%
time serve as a supervisor of the
checklist

05:46:07.830 --> 05:46:07.840 align:start position:0%
checklist
 
05:46:10.230 --> 05:46:10.240 align:start position:0%
the second change you're going to see um
 
05:46:14.190 --> 05:46:14.200 align:start position:0%
is that my bill amends RSA 669 col
 
05:46:17.230 --> 05:46:17.240 align:start position:0%
64 it authorizes the town moderator
 
05:46:19.150 --> 05:46:19.160 align:start position:0%
rather than the remaining supervisors
 
05:46:21.750 --> 05:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
quote unquote to fill seats on the Su on
 
05:46:23.628 --> 05:46:23.638 align:start position:0%
the supervisor's board should they
 
05:46:23.638 --> 05:46:26.230 align:start position:0%
the supervisor's board should they
become

05:46:26.230 --> 05:46:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:29.310 --> 05:46:29.320 align:start position:0%
vacant and a final change was added
 
05:46:31.390 --> 05:46:31.400 align:start position:0%
requiring that an appointed
 
05:46:33.830 --> 05:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
supervisor um come from the same
 
05:46:36.868 --> 05:46:36.878 align:start position:0%
political party if known if as the super
 
05:46:39.548 --> 05:46:39.558 align:start position:0%
supervisor vacating a position and I
 
05:46:41.468 --> 05:46:41.478 align:start position:0%
added this in to ensure that the
 
05:46:44.150 --> 05:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
political makeup the of the supervisors
 
05:46:45.990 --> 05:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
previously elected by voters was not
 
05:46:47.310 --> 05:46:47.320 align:start position:0%
influenced or
 
05:46:54.430 --> 05:46:54.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:58.788 --> 05:46:58.798 align:start position:0%
62 states that a town moderator vacancy
 
05:47:01.310 --> 05:47:01.320 align:start position:0%
a town moderator vacancy shall be filled
 
05:47:03.390 --> 05:47:03.400 align:start position:0%
by appoint By Appointment made by the
 
05:47:05.708 --> 05:47:05.718 align:start position:0%
supervisors of the
 
05:47:09.590 --> 05:47:09.600 align:start position:0%
checklist um um so a potential issue
 
05:47:12.190 --> 05:47:12.200 align:start position:0%
because I did spend my week reading
 
05:47:15.468 --> 05:47:15.478 align:start position:0%
through the election laws in our
 
05:47:19.430 --> 05:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
RCS so a potential had a fun week
 
05:47:22.350 --> 05:47:22.360 align:start position:0%
yeah a potential issue for this bill
 
05:47:24.230 --> 05:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
might appear to be that the checklist
 
05:47:26.468 --> 05:47:26.478 align:start position:0%
information handled by the supervisors
 
05:47:29.150 --> 05:47:29.160 align:start position:0%
includes public and non-public
 
05:47:33.110 --> 05:47:33.120 align:start position:0%
information and RSA 6 5431 describes the
 
05:47:35.708 --> 05:47:35.718 align:start position:0%
non-public checklist as the checklist
 
05:47:37.430 --> 05:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
bearing names of Voters who by law are
 
05:47:39.230 --> 05:47:39.240 align:start position:0%
entitled to have their status as a voter
 
05:47:40.990 --> 05:47:41.000 align:start position:0%
kept non-public for reasons such as
 
05:47:41.000 --> 05:47:42.788 align:start position:0%
kept non-public for reasons such as
protective

05:47:42.788 --> 05:47:42.798 align:start position:0%
protective
 
05:47:47.310 --> 05:47:47.320 align:start position:0%
orders and RSA 654 31 describes a right
 
05:47:49.070 --> 05:47:49.080 align:start position:0%
to know exemption which states only
 
05:47:50.708 --> 05:47:50.718 align:start position:0%
public information is subject to right
 
05:47:52.670 --> 05:47:52.680 align:start position:0%
to know when it comes to voter
 
05:47:54.990 --> 05:47:55.000 align:start position:0%
information all other information shall
 
05:47:57.390 --> 05:47:57.400 align:start position:0%
be treated as confidential information
 
05:47:59.310 --> 05:47:59.320 align:start position:0%
and exempt from public
 
05:48:01.510 --> 05:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
disclosure however I read further in
 
05:48:03.670 --> 05:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
this particular RSA and it states
 
05:48:06.788 --> 05:48:06.798 align:start position:0%
election officials and law enforcement
 
05:48:08.750 --> 05:48:08.760 align:start position:0%
in furtherance of their official duties
 
05:48:11.628 --> 05:48:11.638 align:start position:0%
May access and may disclose information
 
05:48:13.708 --> 05:48:13.718 align:start position:0%
from the voter registration forms
 
05:48:16.830 --> 05:48:16.840 align:start position:0%
affidavits religious exemptions and
 
05:48:19.510 --> 05:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
other information necessary to resolve a
 
05:48:21.310 --> 05:48:21.320 align:start position:0%
challenge to an individual registering
 
05:48:25.110 --> 05:48:25.120 align:start position:0%
to vote or if or voting if necessary to
 
05:48:27.230 --> 05:48:27.240 align:start position:0%
investigate and prosecute election law
 
05:48:29.548 --> 05:48:29.558 align:start position:0%
violations so there is a role for
 
05:48:31.628 --> 05:48:31.638 align:start position:0%
non-public information if you're an
 
05:48:31.638 --> 05:48:33.910 align:start position:0%
non-public information if you're an
elected

05:48:33.910 --> 05:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
elected
 
05:48:36.310 --> 05:48:36.320 align:start position:0%
official and that's all I have I'd be
 
05:48:38.270 --> 05:48:38.280 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any
 
05:48:41.110 --> 05:48:41.120 align:start position:0%
questions other questions from the
 
05:48:43.788 --> 05:48:43.798 align:start position:0%
committee yeah go ahead representative
 
05:48:46.110 --> 05:48:46.120 align:start position:0%
Ward thank you and thank you for taking
 
05:48:49.070 --> 05:48:49.080 align:start position:0%
my question I wonder if you'd indulge me
 
05:48:51.948 --> 05:48:51.958 align:start position:0%
in describe what you see going on on
 
05:48:55.110 --> 05:48:55.120 align:start position:0%
Election Day as described in lines 19
 
05:48:55.120 --> 05:48:56.230 align:start position:0%
Election Day as described in lines 19
through

05:48:56.230 --> 05:48:56.240 align:start position:0%
through
 
05:49:00.030 --> 05:49:00.040 align:start position:0%
21 how are these inspectors going to see
 
05:49:02.910 --> 05:49:02.920 align:start position:0%
the documents and if there's two
 
05:49:04.548 --> 05:49:04.558 align:start position:0%
inspectors and there's six or seven
 
05:49:07.468 --> 05:49:07.478 align:start position:0%
people signing up new registrant how are
 
05:49:09.030 --> 05:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
they going to they're going to stop and
 
05:49:11.230 --> 05:49:11.240 align:start position:0%
look at every
 
05:49:11.240 --> 05:49:13.270 align:start position:0%
look at every
document

05:49:13.270 --> 05:49:13.280 align:start position:0%
document
 
05:49:16.670 --> 05:49:16.680 align:start position:0%
well the idea is that the inspectors of
 
05:49:19.030 --> 05:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
Elections would attend meetings of the
 
05:49:20.948 --> 05:49:20.958 align:start position:0%
supervisors during the year when they're
 
05:49:23.590 --> 05:49:23.600 align:start position:0%
registering new new voters looking at
 
05:49:27.310 --> 05:49:27.320 align:start position:0%
documentation to verify ID domicile and
 
05:49:29.430 --> 05:49:29.440 align:start position:0%
citizenship so that would be something
 
05:49:32.350 --> 05:49:32.360 align:start position:0%
that they could do um they don't have to
 
05:49:34.310 --> 05:49:34.320 align:start position:0%
do that but it's an option that they
 
05:49:37.030 --> 05:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
Avail that would be available to them
 
05:49:38.910 --> 05:49:38.920 align:start position:0%
and they also do work on Election Day
 
05:49:41.110 --> 05:49:41.120 align:start position:0%
the inspectors are the two of them at
 
05:49:43.788 --> 05:49:43.798 align:start position:0%
least are pole workers others can be
 
05:49:45.830 --> 05:49:45.840 align:start position:0%
appointed as well but at least two
 
05:49:49.350 --> 05:49:49.360 align:start position:0%
become pole workers what do you follow
 
05:49:53.230 --> 05:49:53.240 align:start position:0%
what do you mean by pole worker um
 
05:49:55.590 --> 05:49:55.600 align:start position:0%
inspectors of elections are appointed by
 
05:49:59.070 --> 05:49:59.080 align:start position:0%
political parties and two are appointed
 
05:50:02.390 --> 05:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
to each um polling
 
05:50:05.230 --> 05:50:05.240 align:start position:0%
place two of them become regular poll
 
05:50:07.310 --> 05:50:07.320 align:start position:0%
workers they're sworn in and they they
 
05:50:09.230 --> 05:50:09.240 align:start position:0%
do they do regular poll
 
05:50:11.868 --> 05:50:11.878 align:start position:0%
work like hand out follow hand out
 
05:50:11.878 --> 05:50:13.510 align:start position:0%
work like hand out follow hand out
ballots

05:50:13.510 --> 05:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
ballots
 
05:50:16.310 --> 05:50:16.320 align:start position:0%
yes further questions representative
 
05:50:20.468 --> 05:50:20.478 align:start position:0%
Newsome thank you um the amendment in
 
05:50:24.350 --> 05:50:24.360 align:start position:0%
line the part in 27 and 28 that um says
 
05:50:26.390 --> 05:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
if a town elects supervisors by means of
 
05:50:28.708 --> 05:50:28.718 align:start position:0%
partisan ballot it would be so you're
 
05:50:32.030 --> 05:50:32.040 align:start position:0%
removing that part so isn't that making
 
05:50:33.670 --> 05:50:33.680 align:start position:0%
a what would be a
 
05:50:37.070 --> 05:50:37.080 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan position into a partisan an
 
05:50:39.070 --> 05:50:39.080 align:start position:0%
appointment when the towns have already
 
05:50:41.070 --> 05:50:41.080 align:start position:0%
made the conscious decision not to have
 
05:50:41.080 --> 05:50:46.628 align:start position:0%
made the conscious decision not to have
partisan

05:50:46.628 --> 05:50:46.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:49.030 --> 05:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
supervisors I think that the way I've
 
05:50:52.670 --> 05:50:52.680 align:start position:0%
written drafted this um it would include
 
05:50:55.230 --> 05:50:55.240 align:start position:0%
either partisan or nonpartisan towns
 
05:50:57.230 --> 05:50:57.240 align:start position:0%
elections for this position for the
 
05:50:57.240 --> 05:50:58.788 align:start position:0%
elections for this position for the
supervisor's

05:50:58.788 --> 05:50:58.798 align:start position:0%
supervisor's
 
05:51:01.548 --> 05:51:01.558 align:start position:0%
position yeah oh thank you but in a town
 
05:51:03.708 --> 05:51:03.718 align:start position:0%
that has
 
05:51:05.628 --> 05:51:05.638 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan why would then all of a
 
05:51:07.990 --> 05:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
sudden it would have to be a partisan
 
05:51:10.270 --> 05:51:10.280 align:start position:0%
replacement that's a good question I was
 
05:51:12.628 --> 05:51:12.638 align:start position:0%
just trying to maintain the the
 
05:51:16.030 --> 05:51:16.040 align:start position:0%
political makeup of the supervisors
 
05:51:17.670 --> 05:51:17.680 align:start position:0%
static and
 
05:51:21.390 --> 05:51:21.400 align:start position:0%
unchanging um but I'd be happy to it's
 
05:51:24.230 --> 05:51:24.240 align:start position:0%
your bill now but I'd be happy to
 
05:51:26.390 --> 05:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
entertain an amendment to strike that
 
05:51:31.150 --> 05:51:31.160 align:start position:0%
section I was just trying to um allow
 
05:51:34.548 --> 05:51:34.558 align:start position:0%
for um a supervisor who's been elected
 
05:51:36.708 --> 05:51:36.718 align:start position:0%
say as a Republican and there are two
 
05:51:39.910 --> 05:51:39.920 align:start position:0%
Democrats to continue to have a
 
05:51:43.990 --> 05:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
particular um supervisor appointed who
 
05:51:46.030 --> 05:51:46.040 align:start position:0%
is from the same political party as the
 
05:51:48.110 --> 05:51:48.120 align:start position:0%
person who's being replaced but that was
 
05:51:50.150 --> 05:51:50.160 align:start position:0%
just something I thought about adding I
 
05:51:51.670 --> 05:51:51.680 align:start position:0%
it's not something I would it's not a
 
05:51:55.110 --> 05:51:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:58.750 --> 05:51:58.760 align:start position:0%
on further questions um my only question
 
05:52:00.390 --> 05:52:00.400 align:start position:0%
is and you I'm glad you brought it up in
 
05:52:02.750 --> 05:52:02.760 align:start position:0%
your testimony which is these uh
 
05:52:04.830 --> 05:52:04.840 align:start position:0%
protected names on the checklist you
 
05:52:08.628 --> 05:52:08.638 align:start position:0%
know you mentioned RSA 3 654 31 you know
 
05:52:11.070 --> 05:52:11.080 align:start position:0%
25 has the same language in it um the
 
05:52:12.548 --> 05:52:12.558 align:start position:0%
name and address of voter shall not
 
05:52:14.670 --> 05:52:14.680 align:start position:0%
appear on checklist at the request of a
 
05:52:16.190 --> 05:52:16.200 align:start position:0%
voter if a voter presents supervisor of
 
05:52:17.430 --> 05:52:17.440 align:start position:0%
the checklist with the valid protective
 
05:52:21.190 --> 05:52:21.200 align:start position:0%
order um you not see an issue with
 
05:52:22.788 --> 05:52:22.798 align:start position:0%
people who've never been through the
 
05:52:25.030 --> 05:52:25.040 align:start position:0%
scrutiny of an election having access to
 
05:52:26.788 --> 05:52:26.798 align:start position:0%
these this basically this this
 
05:52:32.150 --> 05:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:34.670 --> 05:52:34.680 align:start position:0%
orders well I'm thinking the inspectors
 
05:52:37.750 --> 05:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
would be there not actively voting or
 
05:52:39.948 --> 05:52:39.958 align:start position:0%
taking part in the activities of the
 
05:52:42.750 --> 05:52:42.760 align:start position:0%
supervisors but just being observers
 
05:52:44.548 --> 05:52:44.558 align:start position:0%
okay um any other
 
05:52:46.590 --> 05:52:46.600 align:start position:0%
questions all right seeing none thank
 
05:52:48.510 --> 05:52:48.520 align:start position:0%
you thank you so much I only have one
 
05:52:50.948 --> 05:52:50.958 align:start position:0%
other card um Sarah Brook Cohen from the
 
05:52:53.430 --> 05:52:53.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Municipal Association um
 
05:52:54.910 --> 05:52:54.920 align:start position:0%
representative gusovsky if you grab me
 
05:53:02.548 --> 05:53:02.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:05.030 --> 05:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
sheet good afternoon my name is Sarah
 
05:53:06.788 --> 05:53:06.798 align:start position:0%
Burke Cohen I represent the Hampshire
 
05:53:09.350 --> 05:53:09.360 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association the New Hampshire
 
05:53:12.110 --> 05:53:12.120 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association opposes this bill
 
05:53:13.868 --> 05:53:13.878 align:start position:0%
um I think the committee has brought up
 
05:53:15.948 --> 05:53:15.958 align:start position:0%
a number of the issues that we see with
 
05:53:18.708 --> 05:53:18.718 align:start position:0%
it um the inspectors
 
05:53:22.230 --> 05:53:22.240 align:start position:0%
um as stated in this bill would uh be
 
05:53:24.310 --> 05:53:24.320 align:start position:0%
allowed access to personally
 
05:53:27.150 --> 05:53:27.160 align:start position:0%
identifiable information of Voters and
 
05:53:30.830 --> 05:53:30.840 align:start position:0%
they are not authorized uh people to be
 
05:53:33.708 --> 05:53:33.718 align:start position:0%
doing that including 173b which is on
 
05:53:38.430 --> 05:53:38.440 align:start position:0%
the um non-public 17 B 173b restraining
 
05:53:38.440 --> 05:53:41.310 align:start position:0%
the um non-public 17 B 173b restraining
order

05:53:41.310 --> 05:53:41.320 align:start position:0%
order
 
05:53:43.468 --> 05:53:43.478 align:start position:0%
um indications that are on the
 
05:53:46.670 --> 05:53:46.680 align:start position:0%
non-public list um with regard to the
 
05:53:49.990 --> 05:53:50.000 align:start position:0%
appointment of the um supervisors of the
 
05:53:52.548 --> 05:53:52.558 align:start position:0%
checklist um my understanding is
 
05:53:55.548 --> 05:53:55.558 align:start position:0%
Portsmith is the only um partisan El
 
05:53:59.270 --> 05:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
electing City in the state and town um
 
05:54:02.350 --> 05:54:02.360 align:start position:0%
so the language um in six the new
 
05:54:04.430 --> 05:54:04.440 align:start position:0%
language in
 
05:54:06.910 --> 05:54:06.920 align:start position:0%
66964 um to go on what representative
 
05:54:08.868 --> 05:54:08.878 align:start position:0%
Newsome would be problematic given that
 
05:54:11.510 --> 05:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
you would be uh essentially making a
 
05:54:13.750 --> 05:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
partisan position from a nonpartisan
 
05:54:16.070 --> 05:54:16.080 align:start position:0%
position in municipalities that have
 
05:54:17.830 --> 05:54:17.840 align:start position:0%
elected to stay
 
05:54:17.840 --> 05:54:19.830 align:start position:0%
elected to stay
nonpartisan

05:54:19.830 --> 05:54:19.840 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan
 
05:54:24.430 --> 05:54:24.440 align:start position:0%
um in addition um it's not uh a regular
 
05:54:26.430 --> 05:54:26.440 align:start position:0%
activity for the moderator to be
 
05:54:29.990 --> 05:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
appointing um people to positions um I
 
05:54:31.750 --> 05:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
believe the only position that's
 
05:54:34.030 --> 05:54:34.040 align:start position:0%
appointed by a moderator if it's vacant
 
05:54:37.990 --> 05:54:38.000 align:start position:0%
is on uh a municipal budget committee um
 
05:54:40.548 --> 05:54:40.558 align:start position:0%
it having talked to some of the
 
05:54:42.628 --> 05:54:42.638 align:start position:0%
supervisors of the checklist their
 
05:54:44.430 --> 05:54:44.440 align:start position:0%
thought process is the moderator doesn't
 
05:54:46.230 --> 05:54:46.240 align:start position:0%
often have an understand true
 
05:54:47.548 --> 05:54:47.558 align:start position:0%
understanding of what the supervisors of
 
05:54:51.628 --> 05:54:51.638 align:start position:0%
the checklists um have to do and that is
 
05:54:53.990 --> 05:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
why it is in the hands of the others on
 
05:54:55.948 --> 05:54:55.958 align:start position:0%
the supervisors of the checklist uh
 
05:54:59.590 --> 05:54:59.600 align:start position:0%
board to um fill the fill that vacancy
 
05:55:04.390 --> 05:55:04.400 align:start position:0%
um with that said um as I said nhma uh W
 
05:55:06.750 --> 05:55:06.760 align:start position:0%
opposes this bill in uh would like you
 
05:55:09.788 --> 05:55:09.798 align:start position:0%
to itl it questions are there questions
 
05:55:14.110 --> 05:55:14.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:17.390 --> 05:55:17.400 align:start position:0%
Gore does has the municipal Association
 
05:55:19.670 --> 05:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
ever had
 
05:55:22.270 --> 05:55:22.280 align:start position:0%
any interaction
 
05:55:27.948 --> 05:55:27.958 align:start position:0%
with ter here um inspectors of
 
05:55:32.468 --> 05:55:32.478 align:start position:0%
election I mean I've been a moderator or
 
05:55:35.110 --> 05:55:35.120 align:start position:0%
supervisor checklist 20 years and uh
 
05:55:37.628 --> 05:55:37.638 align:start position:0%
I've never come across before so this is
 
05:55:39.548 --> 05:55:39.558 align:start position:0%
a new thing to
 
05:55:42.150 --> 05:55:42.160 align:start position:0%
me you've never had an inspector at your
 
05:55:44.990 --> 05:55:45.000 align:start position:0%
poll I've I've had the AG's office show
 
05:55:47.390 --> 05:55:47.400 align:start position:0%
up okay I mean that's
 
05:55:49.788 --> 05:55:49.798 align:start position:0%
normal I don't actually work a polling
 
05:55:53.670 --> 05:55:53.680 align:start position:0%
site um but um my understanding is with
 
05:55:56.030 --> 05:55:56.040 align:start position:0%
what the um the appointment and
 
05:55:58.030 --> 05:55:58.040 align:start position:0%
Authority that is in this bill would
 
05:56:00.110 --> 05:56:00.120 align:start position:0%
allow inspectors to be appointed by
 
05:56:03.430 --> 05:56:03.440 align:start position:0%
their political party and have access to
 
05:56:06.070 --> 05:56:06.080 align:start position:0%
voter information right they they are
 
05:56:07.670 --> 05:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
I'm just saying that's what that's
 
05:56:09.310 --> 05:56:09.320 align:start position:0%
that's what I see too and I've just
 
05:56:11.230 --> 05:56:11.240 align:start position:0%
never experienced that I mean I do have
 
05:56:13.948 --> 05:56:13.958 align:start position:0%
the AG show up for five minutes and but
 
05:56:15.350 --> 05:56:15.360 align:start position:0%
that's you know that's just part of the
 
05:56:17.910 --> 05:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
routine that's not our understanding is
 
05:56:21.590 --> 05:56:21.600 align:start position:0%
inspectors are are allowed to and do go
 
05:56:24.350 --> 05:56:24.360 align:start position:0%
to polling sit
 
05:56:27.468 --> 05:56:27.478 align:start position:0%
well maybe not yours I thank you yeah
 
05:56:28.708 --> 05:56:28.718 align:start position:0%
okay further questions from the
 
05:56:30.990 --> 05:56:31.000 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you um I
 
05:56:33.150 --> 05:56:33.160 align:start position:0%
don't have any other cards there was

online there was four in support 58
 
05:56:41.110 --> 05:56:41.120 align:start position:0%
against one neutral with that I will
 
05:56:42.468 --> 05:56:42.478 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing for House Bill
 
05:56:45.030 --> 05:56:45.040 align:start position:0%

06:09:49.990 --> 06:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
okay okay all right uh we we did 409
 
06:09:52.390 --> 06:09:52.400 align:start position:0%
great hearing all right going to open up
 
06:09:54.868 --> 06:09:54.878 align:start position:0%
the public hearing for House Bill 521
 
06:09:56.948 --> 06:09:56.958 align:start position:0%
authorizing online voter registration
 
06:09:58.628 --> 06:09:58.638 align:start position:0%
representative Paige yeah there you are
 
06:10:00.910 --> 06:10:00.920 align:start position:0%
say I knew it's your bill I don't did
 
06:10:03.590 --> 06:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
you fill out a card for us yet
 
06:10:07.110 --> 06:10:07.120 align:start position:0%
representative awesome
 
06:10:10.270 --> 06:10:10.280 align:start position:0%
um no problem we don't have too many
 
06:10:11.350 --> 06:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
cards for this I thought thought there
 
06:10:12.910 --> 06:10:12.920 align:start position:0%
would have been
 
06:10:15.310 --> 06:10:15.320 align:start position:0%
more I gave this one extra time I think
 
06:10:18.310 --> 06:10:18.320 align:start position:0%
didn't I no I scheduled it before
 
06:10:22.270 --> 06:10:22.280 align:start position:0%
the all right Paige welcome back to
 
06:10:23.590 --> 06:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
election law you were here you were our
 
06:10:27.990 --> 06:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
very first bill actually oh thank you
 
06:10:30.270 --> 06:10:30.280 align:start position:0%
and not your last so thank you I guess I
 
06:10:34.510 --> 06:10:34.520 align:start position:0%
get points for showing up um this is my
 
06:10:36.190 --> 06:10:36.200 align:start position:0%
for the record I'm Mark page I represent
 
06:10:40.030 --> 06:10:40.040 align:start position:0%
the town of exiter Rockingham 11 and um
 
06:10:42.910 --> 06:10:42.920 align:start position:0%
this bill is a bill that would create
 
06:10:45.548 --> 06:10:45.558 align:start position:0%
online voter registration pretty
 
06:10:47.830 --> 06:10:47.840 align:start position:0%
straightforward um I think heard a lot
 
06:10:50.310 --> 06:10:50.320 align:start position:0%
of feedback from the last election about
 
06:10:53.750 --> 06:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh length of lines um I heard from a
 
06:10:56.990 --> 06:10:57.000 align:start position:0%
number of folks too who were new to my
 
06:10:59.510 --> 06:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
town but um not new to New Hampshire
 
06:11:02.990 --> 06:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
about registering to vote uh and
 
06:11:04.430 --> 06:11:04.440 align:start position:0%
repeating that process this bill would
 
06:11:05.750 --> 06:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
address that as well
 
06:11:08.628 --> 06:11:08.638 align:start position:0%
So Not only would it um expedite the
 
06:11:10.270 --> 06:11:10.280 align:start position:0%
process for registering to vote but it
 
06:11:12.548 --> 06:11:12.558 align:start position:0%
would expedite the process for folks who
 
06:11:14.548 --> 06:11:14.558 align:start position:0%
move within New Hampshire from a ward or
 
06:11:15.910 --> 06:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
from a different neighboring town which
 
06:11:20.110 --> 06:11:20.120 align:start position:0%
happens uh quite frequently um this
 
06:11:22.468 --> 06:11:22.478 align:start position:0%
would if we were to pass this uh we
 
06:11:24.868 --> 06:11:24.878 align:start position:0%
would be the 43rd state to do it so it's
 
06:11:27.590 --> 06:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
been modeled and done with some Success
 
06:11:30.590 --> 06:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire rightfully uh you know can
 
06:11:32.750 --> 06:11:32.760 align:start position:0%
take their time to make sure we don't
 
06:11:34.270 --> 06:11:34.280 align:start position:0%
make any mistakes that other states have
 
06:11:36.390 --> 06:11:36.400 align:start position:0%
done but I think now at this point with
 
06:11:39.868 --> 06:11:39.878 align:start position:0%
42 States having success we can um
 
06:11:43.390 --> 06:11:43.400 align:start position:0%
perhaps take some lessons from that um
 
06:11:46.670 --> 06:11:46.680 align:start position:0%
the system would would um in essence you
 
06:11:48.350 --> 06:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
know be only available for folks with
 
06:11:51.708 --> 06:11:51.718 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um IDs and it would allow
 
06:11:54.750 --> 06:11:54.760 align:start position:0%
the um registrations to process only if
 
06:11:57.750 --> 06:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
uh the verification of through the DMV
 
06:12:00.708 --> 06:12:00.718 align:start position:0%
of age citizenship all the requirements
 
06:12:02.628 --> 06:12:02.638 align:start position:0%
um for for registering vote the bill
 
06:12:03.910 --> 06:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
does not make any changes to the
 
06:12:06.628 --> 06:12:06.638 align:start position:0%
requirements of voting to of registering
 
06:12:08.548 --> 06:12:08.558 align:start position:0%
to vote in fact it's a bit dynamic
 
06:12:11.110 --> 06:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
because the language in it would just
 
06:12:13.310 --> 06:12:13.320 align:start position:0%
whatever the requirements are uh would
 
06:12:16.548 --> 06:12:16.558 align:start position:0%
continue along um just the registration
 
06:12:19.430 --> 06:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
system allows for an online
 
06:12:22.510 --> 06:12:22.520 align:start position:0%
option um election ficials still at the
 
06:12:24.310 --> 06:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
local level supervisors of the checklist
 
06:12:27.030 --> 06:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
still uh would have uh be at the core of
 
06:12:28.628 --> 06:12:28.638 align:start position:0%
the process because they would be the
 
06:12:31.270 --> 06:12:31.280 align:start position:0%
applications would be submitted to them
 
06:12:33.548 --> 06:12:33.558 align:start position:0%
uh and for their determination of uh
 
06:12:36.190 --> 06:12:36.200 align:start position:0%
putting them on the on the RO s in
 
06:12:38.468 --> 06:12:38.478 align:start position:0%
addition uh signature would be required
 
06:12:42.110 --> 06:12:42.120 align:start position:0%
for the first vote for the when a first
 
06:12:43.628 --> 06:12:43.638 align:start position:0%
when a person first shows up to vote for
 
06:12:46.030 --> 06:12:46.040 align:start position:0%
the first time they would be required to
 
06:12:48.070 --> 06:12:48.080 align:start position:0%
uh present their signature uh and as
 
06:12:50.670 --> 06:12:50.680 align:start position:0%
well to request an absentee
 
06:12:50.680 --> 06:12:52.190 align:start position:0%
well to request an absentee
ballot

06:12:52.190 --> 06:12:52.200 align:start position:0%
ballot
 
06:12:56.030 --> 06:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
um they would have to uh do that as well
 
06:12:58.750 --> 06:12:58.760 align:start position:0%
so that's that's in essence what it is
 
06:12:59.990 --> 06:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
there folks behind me that can probably
 
06:13:01.628 --> 06:13:01.638 align:start position:0%
speak to more of the technical
 
06:13:05.510 --> 06:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
aspects uh of the bill I think it helps
 
06:13:07.990 --> 06:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
capture some efficiencies a lot of this
 
06:13:11.030 --> 06:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
information exists over at the DMV U my
 
06:13:11.830 --> 06:13:11.840 align:start position:0%
understanding is the Secretary of
 
06:13:16.990 --> 06:13:17.000 align:start position:0%
State's office is uh in the midst of um
 
06:13:19.468 --> 06:13:19.478 align:start position:0%
creating rfps or redeveloping their
 
06:13:20.990 --> 06:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
voter registration database this would
 
06:13:22.628 --> 06:13:22.638 align:start position:0%
kind of work in concert with that so
 
06:13:24.430 --> 06:13:24.440 align:start position:0%
this is potential to capture
 
06:13:28.510 --> 06:13:28.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:32.670 --> 06:13:32.680 align:start position:0%
um yeah happy to answer
 
06:13:34.788 --> 06:13:34.798 align:start position:0%
questions okay are there questions from
 
06:13:34.798 --> 06:13:37.270 align:start position:0%
questions okay are there questions from
the

06:13:37.270 --> 06:13:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:39.350 --> 06:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
oh all right fire a couple people who
 
06:13:41.910 --> 06:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
wants to go first right representative
 
06:13:46.270 --> 06:13:46.280 align:start position:0%
wood thank you taking my question um is
 
06:13:48.110 --> 06:13:48.120 align:start position:0%
this going to be used in conjunction
 
06:13:50.548 --> 06:13:50.558 align:start position:0%
with other databases in the town in the
 
06:13:53.190 --> 06:13:53.200 align:start position:0%
state you mentioned the
 
06:13:55.670 --> 06:13:55.680 align:start position:0%
DMV well the the information from the
 
06:13:59.830 --> 06:13:59.840 align:start position:0%
DMV would be um used uh to verif as
 
06:14:02.150 --> 06:14:02.160 align:start position:0%
verified through that with in
 
06:14:04.110 --> 06:14:04.120 align:start position:0%
conjunction with the state uh Secretary
 
06:14:05.868 --> 06:14:05.878 align:start position:0%
of State's voter registration database
 
06:14:08.548 --> 06:14:08.558 align:start position:0%
so uh the information and other folks
 
06:14:10.430 --> 06:14:10.440 align:start position:0%
can te speak more to the technical side
 
06:14:12.468 --> 06:14:12.478 align:start position:0%
of things but that that would be the
 
06:14:14.150 --> 06:14:14.160 align:start position:0%
first step at the DMV where they're
 
06:14:16.468 --> 06:14:16.478 align:start position:0%
personally you know checking your
 
06:14:17.948 --> 06:14:17.958 align:start position:0%
information and logging it in their
 
06:14:19.868 --> 06:14:19.878 align:start position:0%
database but if if they if that was
 
06:14:21.990 --> 06:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
inconsistent with the requirements of
 
06:14:24.310 --> 06:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
the election law then then that that
 
06:14:26.270 --> 06:14:26.280 align:start position:0%
would not proceed the registration
 
06:14:27.190 --> 06:14:27.200 align:start position:0%
wouldn't proceed but it would be
 
06:14:30.030 --> 06:14:30.040 align:start position:0%
transmitted through um sharing that
 
06:14:32.430 --> 06:14:32.440 align:start position:0%
information with this to the Secretary
 
06:14:34.030 --> 06:14:34.040 align:start position:0%
of State's office
 
06:14:34.040 --> 06:14:35.628 align:start position:0%
of State's office
yeah

06:14:35.628 --> 06:14:35.638 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
06:14:38.910 --> 06:14:38.920 align:start position:0%
follow thank you um you mentioned
 
06:14:40.990 --> 06:14:41.000 align:start position:0%
signature is does the signature have to
 
06:14:42.910 --> 06:14:42.920 align:start position:0%
be done in person how's the signature
 
06:14:44.390 --> 06:14:44.400 align:start position:0%
going to be collected they need to
 
06:14:47.150 --> 06:14:47.160 align:start position:0%
provide a signature so if we go online
 
06:14:49.670 --> 06:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
get this going you still have to go in
 
06:14:52.468 --> 06:14:52.478 align:start position:0%
and sign so your first electronic
 
06:14:54.590 --> 06:14:54.600 align:start position:0%
signature would start the process going
 
06:14:56.708 --> 06:14:56.718 align:start position:0%
electronic and then your signature
 
06:14:58.670 --> 06:14:58.680 align:start position:0%
before you would vote first you still
 
06:14:59.990 --> 06:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
have to present with a signature for
 
06:15:02.510 --> 06:15:02.520 align:start position:0%
your first
 
06:15:04.230 --> 06:15:04.240 align:start position:0%
ballot further questions from the
 
06:15:08.670 --> 06:15:08.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:11.230 --> 06:15:11.240 align:start position:0%
I guess I have a question about we've
 
06:15:14.150 --> 06:15:14.160 align:start position:0%
we've got before us numerous bills about
 
06:15:14.160 --> 06:15:16.270 align:start position:0%
we've got before us numerous bills about
citizenship

06:15:16.270 --> 06:15:16.280 align:start position:0%
citizenship
 
06:15:18.190 --> 06:15:18.200 align:start position:0%
requirements to my knowledge there's
 
06:15:20.070 --> 06:15:20.080 align:start position:0%
nothing in New Hampshire or even at the
 
06:15:23.350 --> 06:15:23.360 align:start position:0%
federal level that would allow you to
 
06:15:26.230 --> 06:15:26.240 align:start position:0%
verify citizenship through a database is
 
06:15:28.390 --> 06:15:28.400 align:start position:0%
that your understanding as well that
 
06:15:32.150 --> 06:15:32.160 align:start position:0%
there's nothing I believe so yes so what
 
06:15:35.430 --> 06:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
would someone do here
 
06:15:38.350 --> 06:15:38.360 align:start position:0%
to prove citizenship under
 
06:15:41.788 --> 06:15:41.798 align:start position:0%
this so I I think through the DMV
 
06:15:43.910 --> 06:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
process if you were going through a real
 
06:15:47.430 --> 06:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
ID process the documents that you could
 
06:15:50.270 --> 06:15:50.280 align:start position:0%
present would be a pass a birth
 
06:15:52.788 --> 06:15:52.798 align:start position:0%
certificate things that would be would
 
06:15:54.548 --> 06:15:54.558 align:start position:0%
would speak to citizenship and that
 
06:15:57.708 --> 06:15:57.718 align:start position:0%
would be on file with the DMV if I'm
 
06:15:59.030 --> 06:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
understanding your question
 
06:16:03.468 --> 06:16:03.478 align:start position:0%
correctly followup yeah I'll save it for
 
06:16:07.670 --> 06:16:07.680 align:start position:0%

Hampshire under age 50 to be civically
 
06:17:05.628 --> 06:17:05.638 align:start position:0%
engaged I'm here to test ify in support
 
06:17:08.230 --> 06:17:08.240 align:start position:0%
of House Bill 521 which would establish
 
06:17:10.230 --> 06:17:10.240 align:start position:0%
an online voter registration system in
 
06:17:13.510 --> 06:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire this legislation is common
 
06:17:16.670 --> 06:17:16.680 align:start position:0%
sense it would modernize our elections
 
06:17:19.030 --> 06:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
save taxpayer money make voter
 
06:17:20.868 --> 06:17:20.878 align:start position:0%
registration more accessible and
 
06:17:20.878 --> 06:17:22.230 align:start position:0%
registration more accessible and
increase

06:17:22.230 --> 06:17:22.240 align:start position:0%
increase
 
06:17:24.590 --> 06:17:24.600 align:start position:0%
efficiency this bill reflects the
 
06:17:28.548 --> 06:17:28.558 align:start position:0%
reality of the lives of busy Granite
 
06:17:30.948 --> 06:17:30.958 align:start position:0%
Staters I myself am a busy working
 
06:17:33.788 --> 06:17:33.798 align:start position:0%
parent I've moved numerous times to
 
06:17:35.430 --> 06:17:35.440 align:start position:0%
different towns in New Hampshire I've
 
06:17:37.750 --> 06:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
owned homes in Bristol and
 
06:17:40.830 --> 06:17:40.840 align:start position:0%
conquered when I got married I changed
 
06:17:43.948 --> 06:17:43.958 align:start position:0%
my last name I've often had a commute to
 
06:17:47.548 --> 06:17:47.558 align:start position:0%
both bring my kids to school and to work
 
06:17:49.350 --> 06:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
and I worked during regular business
 
06:17:52.350 --> 06:17:52.360 align:start position:0%
hours and during all of those times I
 
06:17:54.190 --> 06:17:54.200 align:start position:0%
had to take time off of work to go to
 
06:17:56.948 --> 06:17:56.958 align:start position:0%
the town clerk to update my voter
 
06:17:59.270 --> 06:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
registration imagine all of the people
 
06:18:00.990 --> 06:18:01.000 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire who don't have the
 
06:18:03.948 --> 06:18:03.958 align:start position:0%
ability and the time to take to take off
 
06:18:07.030 --> 06:18:07.040 align:start position:0%
work and might just give up and not
 
06:18:09.270 --> 06:18:09.280 align:start position:0%
vote it would have been a lot easier if
 
06:18:10.510 --> 06:18:10.520 align:start position:0%
I could have just updated my
 
06:18:10.520 --> 06:18:11.910 align:start position:0%
I could have just updated my
registration

06:18:11.910 --> 06:18:11.920 align:start position:0%
registration
 
06:18:14.788 --> 06:18:14.798 align:start position:0%
online and this online voter
 
06:18:16.670 --> 06:18:16.680 align:start position:0%
registration has proven to be more
 
06:18:19.788 --> 06:18:19.798 align:start position:0%
secure and less costly in 42 States
 
06:18:21.190 --> 06:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
across the
 
06:18:23.430 --> 06:18:23.440 align:start position:0%
country currently when someone goes to
 
06:18:25.868 --> 06:18:25.878 align:start position:0%
their town clerk to register or update
 
06:18:27.788 --> 06:18:27.798 align:start position:0%
their registration the election
 
06:18:30.510 --> 06:18:30.520 align:start position:0%
officials have to manually type voter
 
06:18:32.548 --> 06:18:32.558 align:start position:0%
registrations and updates into the
 
06:18:36.230 --> 06:18:36.240 align:start position:0%
online system if this were a business we
 
06:18:38.150 --> 06:18:38.160 align:start position:0%
would say no in a heartbeat and
 
06:18:40.310 --> 06:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
modernize the
 
06:18:42.948 --> 06:18:42.958 align:start position:0%
process online voter registration has
 
06:18:45.708 --> 06:18:45.718 align:start position:0%
been proven to be more secure reduce
 
06:18:48.190 --> 06:18:48.200 align:start position:0%
time be more cost effective and allow
 
06:18:50.430 --> 06:18:50.440 align:start position:0%
busy people with all kinds of things in
 
06:18:52.590 --> 06:18:52.600 align:start position:0%
their lives going on to still update
 
06:18:55.548 --> 06:18:55.558 align:start position:0%
their registrations and vote for many
 
06:18:58.350 --> 06:18:58.360 align:start position:0%
working AG young Granite Staters with
 
06:19:00.670 --> 06:19:00.680 align:start position:0%

making that extra trip trip during lunch

hour or at the end of their working day
 
06:19:10.830 --> 06:19:10.840 align:start position:0%
can be a significant barrier to
 
06:19:13.510 --> 06:19:13.520 align:start position:0%
registration by allowing voters to
 
06:19:15.750 --> 06:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
safely and easily access this online
 
06:19:19.230 --> 06:19:19.240 align:start position:0%
registration portal House Bill 521 would
 
06:19:21.788 --> 06:19:21.798 align:start position:0%
encourage more people to register before
 
06:19:24.868 --> 06:19:24.878 align:start position:0%
election day reducing the long lines of
 
06:19:27.350 --> 06:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
over two hours we saw in some places
 
06:19:28.590 --> 06:19:28.600 align:start position:0%
this past
 
06:19:31.350 --> 06:19:31.360 align:start position:0%
election reduce confusion at the polls
 
06:19:34.830 --> 06:19:34.840 align:start position:0%
and reduce the need for affidavits
 
06:19:36.868 --> 06:19:36.878 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is only one of eight
 
06:19:38.868 --> 06:19:38.878 align:start position:0%
states that has not yet implemented
 
06:19:41.030 --> 06:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
online voter
 
06:19:42.788 --> 06:19:42.798 align:start position:0%
registration this would ensure that
 
06:19:44.910 --> 06:19:44.920 align:start position:0%
we're keeping Pace with modern ele
 
06:19:47.310 --> 06:19:47.320 align:start position:0%
election processes while maintaining
 
06:19:49.390 --> 06:19:49.400 align:start position:0%
integrity and local
 
06:19:51.750 --> 06:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
control voters would verify their
 
06:19:54.110 --> 06:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
identity using driver's license or non-d
 
06:19:57.030 --> 06:19:57.040 align:start position:0%
driver's ID as we just heard and which
 
06:19:59.948 --> 06:19:59.958 align:start position:0%
still adds the layer of security to
 
06:20:02.070 --> 06:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
registration process and this still
 
06:20:05.070 --> 06:20:05.080 align:start position:0%
allows for uh the identification things
 
06:20:07.948 --> 06:20:07.958 align:start position:0%
that need to be proved it doesn't change
 
06:20:10.990 --> 06:20:11.000 align:start position:0%
that all online registrations would
 
06:20:13.788 --> 06:20:13.798 align:start position:0%
still need to be reviewed by the local
 
06:20:16.590 --> 06:20:16.600 align:start position:0%
election official before being added to
 
06:20:16.600 --> 06:20:18.590 align:start position:0%
election official before being added to
the

06:20:18.590 --> 06:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:20:20.948 --> 06:20:20.958 align:start position:0%
checklist this legislation is not just
 
06:20:23.670 --> 06:20:23.680 align:start position:0%
good for voters it also benefits our
 
06:20:23.680 --> 06:20:24.910 align:start position:0%
good for voters it also benefits our
election

06:20:24.910 --> 06:20:24.920 align:start position:0%
election
 
06:20:27.270 --> 06:20:27.280 align:start position:0%
officials entering registration
 
06:20:29.948 --> 06:20:29.958 align:start position:0%
information online reduces manual data
 
06:20:33.110 --> 06:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
entry errors and saves time for election
 
06:20:35.750 --> 06:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
workers who currently must process paper
 
06:20:37.310 --> 06:20:37.320 align:start position:0%
forms by
 
06:20:39.548 --> 06:20:39.558 align:start position:0%
hand research has shown that online
 
06:20:41.910 --> 06:20:41.920 align:start position:0%
voter registration is also significantly
 
06:20:44.868 --> 06:20:44.878 align:start position:0%
more cost effective than paper
 
06:20:47.670 --> 06:20:47.680 align:start position:0%
registration saving taxpayer
 
06:20:50.030 --> 06:20:50.040 align:start position:0%
dollars currently we can pay our bills
 
06:20:52.590 --> 06:20:52.600 align:start position:0%
online we can register our vehicles we
 
06:20:55.548 --> 06:20:55.558 align:start position:0%
can Bank we can apply for update our
 
06:20:58.830 --> 06:20:58.840 align:start position:0%
driver's license it's time that we allow
 
06:21:00.868 --> 06:21:00.878 align:start position:0%
voters to update their
 
06:21:04.830 --> 06:21:04.840 align:start position:0%
registration in House Bill 521 would
 
06:21:07.708 --> 06:21:07.718 align:start position:0%
bring us into this modern era I
 
06:21:10.150 --> 06:21:10.160 align:start position:0%
encourage you to V please vote a to pass
 
06:21:10.160 --> 06:21:12.430 align:start position:0%
encourage you to V please vote a to pass

521 will you be taking questions from
 
06:21:14.520 --> 06:21:15.910 align:start position:0%
521 will you be taking questions from
the

06:21:15.910 --> 06:21:15.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:21:18.150 --> 06:21:18.160 align:start position:0%
committee yes are there questions from
 
06:21:18.160 --> 06:21:18.868 align:start position:0%
committee yes are there questions from
the

06:21:18.868 --> 06:21:18.878 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:21:21.590 --> 06:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
committee saying none thank you next up
 
06:21:26.230 --> 06:21:26.240 align:start position:0%
is Liz tantarelli on Deck will be Kaylee
 
06:21:29.030 --> 06:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
esto and then after that McKenzie Taylor
 
06:21:52.070 --> 06:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:54.510 --> 06:21:54.520 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Liz tentarelli
 
06:21:57.110 --> 06:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
I'm uh testifying today on behalf of the
 
06:21:59.670 --> 06:21:59.680 align:start position:0%
League of Women Voters of New Hampshire
 
06:22:03.270 --> 06:22:03.280 align:start position:0%
who support this bill as one step in
 
06:22:06.708 --> 06:22:06.718 align:start position:0%
necessary modern ization of our election
 
06:22:09.868 --> 06:22:09.878 align:start position:0%
system I do want to emphasize that this
 
06:22:12.190 --> 06:22:12.200 align:start position:0%
still leaves the supervisors of the
 
06:22:14.590 --> 06:22:14.600 align:start position:0%
checklist in charge of the
 
06:22:17.190 --> 06:22:17.200 align:start position:0%
registration they will see the material
 
06:22:19.788 --> 06:22:19.798 align:start position:0%
that's been submitted online they can
 
06:22:22.910 --> 06:22:22.920 align:start position:0%
check it against State sources and local
 
06:22:26.990 --> 06:22:27.000 align:start position:0%
sources so any attempt to try to trick
 
06:22:28.948 --> 06:22:28.958 align:start position:0%
those supervisors of the checklist would
 
06:22:30.110 --> 06:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
likely be
 
06:22:33.708 --> 06:22:33.718 align:start position:0%
thwarted and um the previous speaker hit
 
06:22:36.390 --> 06:22:36.400 align:start position:0%
some of my other points except for the
 
06:22:39.390 --> 06:22:39.400 align:start position:0%
handwriting issue when people fill out a
 
06:22:42.628 --> 06:22:42.638 align:start position:0%
handwritten voter registration often
 
06:22:44.230 --> 06:22:44.240 align:start position:0%
their handwriting looks like my
 
06:22:46.830 --> 06:22:46.840 align:start position:0%
grandson's handwriting he's a grown-up
 
06:22:49.708 --> 06:22:49.718 align:start position:0%
but his handwriting is terrible and when
 
06:22:51.830 --> 06:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
things are done online which he does
 
06:22:54.590 --> 06:22:54.600 align:start position:0%
very well it's much more likely to be
 
06:22:57.830 --> 06:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
accurate so that's all I have to add to
 
06:22:59.910 --> 06:22:59.920 align:start position:0%
the testimony that was already given
 
06:23:01.510 --> 06:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity if there
 
06:23:03.350 --> 06:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
are questions I'd be happy to answer
 
06:23:03.360 --> 06:23:04.948 align:start position:0%
are questions I'd be happy to answer
them

06:23:04.948 --> 06:23:04.958 align:start position:0%
them
 
06:23:06.510 --> 06:23:06.520 align:start position:0%
further questions other questions from
 
06:23:08.948 --> 06:23:08.958 align:start position:0%
the committee thank you seeing none
 
06:23:16.510 --> 06:23:16.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:18.788 --> 06:23:18.798 align:start position:0%
estadio thank you chairman Barry and
 
06:23:20.670 --> 06:23:20.680 align:start position:0%

06:23:23.030 --> 06:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is Kaye
 
06:23:25.190 --> 06:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
of stadio I'm a Durham voter and public
 
06:23:27.670 --> 06:23:27.680 align:start position:0%
policy fellow with open democracy and
 
06:23:30.628 --> 06:23:30.638 align:start position:0%
I'm testifying today in support of HB
 
06:23:33.390 --> 06:23:33.400 align:start position:0%
521 um members of the special committee
 
06:23:36.670 --> 06:23:36.680 align:start position:0%
on voter confidence in 2022 spent 37
 
06:23:38.628 --> 06:23:38.638 align:start position:0%
hours listening to election workers and
 
06:23:40.510 --> 06:23:40.520 align:start position:0%
other vital stakeholders as they shared
 
06:23:41.868 --> 06:23:41.878 align:start position:0%
what they felt would create higher
 
06:23:44.548 --> 06:23:44.558 align:start position:0%
levels of confidence in our elections
 
06:23:45.868 --> 06:23:45.878 align:start position:0%
many felt that just a simple
 
06:23:48.110 --> 06:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
modernization in the form of creating an
 
06:23:50.270 --> 06:23:50.280 align:start position:0%
online voter registration portal would
 
06:23:52.510 --> 06:23:52.520 align:start position:0%
help create more secure and accessible
 
06:23:54.548 --> 06:23:54.558 align:start position:0%
voting one of the worst things on
 
06:23:56.110 --> 06:23:56.120 align:start position:0%
Election Day is when someone says they
 
06:23:57.910 --> 06:23:57.920 align:start position:0%
are registered to vote that they have
 
06:24:00.510 --> 06:24:00.520 align:start position:0%
voted at this ping location before but
 
06:24:02.708 --> 06:24:02.718 align:start position:0%
they are not on the checklist you check
 
06:24:04.590 --> 06:24:04.600 align:start position:0%
with the supervisor who then located
 
06:24:06.468 --> 06:24:06.478 align:start position:0%
their voter registration paperwork only
 
06:24:08.468 --> 06:24:08.478 align:start position:0%
to find that the individual is on the
 
06:24:10.468 --> 06:24:10.478 align:start position:0%
checklist but their name is spelled
 
06:24:12.430 --> 06:24:12.440 align:start position:0%
incorrectly the second letter of their
 
06:24:14.070 --> 06:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
last name is spelled with an O instead
 
06:24:16.070 --> 06:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
of an A or any sort of
 
06:24:18.190 --> 06:24:18.200 align:start position:0%
combination the voter was incorrectly
 
06:24:19.948 --> 06:24:19.958 align:start position:0%
entered into the database because the
 
06:24:21.590 --> 06:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
superviser of the checklist couldn't
 
06:24:23.628 --> 06:24:23.638 align:start position:0%
read their handwriting and who can blame
 
06:24:25.990 --> 06:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
them establishing an online voter
 
06:24:27.868 --> 06:24:27.878 align:start position:0%
registration portal has the potential to
 
06:24:29.708 --> 06:24:29.718 align:start position:0%
save New Hampshire millions of dollars
 
06:24:32.270 --> 06:24:32.280 align:start position:0%
each election by replacing costly paper
 
06:24:35.030 --> 06:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
based registration forms even without
 
06:24:37.110 --> 06:24:37.120 align:start position:0%
the cost of postage and printing
 
06:24:38.750 --> 06:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
research shows that the pro that
 
06:24:40.628 --> 06:24:40.638 align:start position:0%
processing a paper voter registration
 
06:24:43.070 --> 06:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
application costs approximately
 
06:24:46.350 --> 06:24:46.360 align:start position:0%
$4.72 in staff time if the Senate is
 
06:24:48.628 --> 06:24:48.638 align:start position:0%
able to save local taxpayers money this
 
06:24:51.468 --> 06:24:51.478 align:start position:0%
is just a win-win online voter portal
 
06:24:54.270 --> 06:24:54.280 align:start position:0%
systems are also affordable to set up
 
06:24:56.070 --> 06:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
one idea to strengthen this bill will be
 
06:24:58.150 --> 06:24:58.160 align:start position:0%
to clarify the election procedure manual
 
06:25:00.390 --> 06:25:00.400 align:start position:0%
for allowing a voter to sign the form
 
06:25:02.910 --> 06:25:02.920 align:start position:0%
with a digital signature if we can sign
 
06:25:04.910 --> 06:25:04.920 align:start position:0%
highly important and confidential Bank
 
06:25:07.548 --> 06:25:07.558 align:start position:0%
docu documents with digital signatures
 
06:25:08.948 --> 06:25:08.958 align:start position:0%
we should be able to do the same when it
 
06:25:09.948 --> 06:25:09.958 align:start position:0%
comes to
 
06:25:12.270 --> 06:25:12.280 align:start position:0%
voting um I recommend removing the
 
06:25:14.230 --> 06:25:14.240 align:start position:0%
reference to wet signatures from the
 
06:25:16.868 --> 06:25:16.878 align:start position:0%
election law procedure manual please
 
06:25:18.628 --> 06:25:18.638 align:start position:0%
side with the voters by assisting in the
 
06:25:20.430 --> 06:25:20.440 align:start position:0%
inevitable modernization of New
 
06:25:22.430 --> 06:25:22.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's voter registration system by
 
06:25:25.628 --> 06:25:25.638 align:start position:0%
voting a to pass on HB 521 thank you and
 
06:25:27.750 --> 06:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
I'll take questions if there are any
 
06:25:30.628 --> 06:25:30.638 align:start position:0%
other questions can you send us that
 
06:25:33.350 --> 06:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
$421 statistic yes I can um because that
 
06:25:34.830 --> 06:25:34.840 align:start position:0%
actually those things are always very
 
06:25:37.390 --> 06:25:37.400 align:start position:0%
interesting to me yeah um next last up
 
06:25:47.310 --> 06:25:47.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:49.830 --> 06:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
Taylor good afternoon chairman members
 
06:25:51.390 --> 06:25:51.400 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is McKenzie
 
06:25:53.708 --> 06:25:53.718 align:start position:0%
Taylor um and I'm with New Hampshire
 
06:25:55.270 --> 06:25:55.280 align:start position:0%
campaign for voting rights and America
 
06:25:57.510 --> 06:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
votes um and I'm here today in support
 
06:26:00.310 --> 06:26:00.320 align:start position:0%
of house Bell 521 um this is a more
 
06:26:03.030 --> 06:26:03.040 align:start position:0%
secure way to allow voters to register
 
06:26:05.270 --> 06:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
or update their registration um ahead of
 
06:26:07.110 --> 06:26:07.120 align:start position:0%
election day while still keeping the
 
06:26:09.350 --> 06:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
security and checks of the election
 
06:26:11.510 --> 06:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
officials in our process uh I was one of
 
06:26:13.430 --> 06:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
the voters who waited about 45 minutes
 
06:26:15.830 --> 06:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
in line just to update my registration
 
06:26:18.190 --> 06:26:18.200 align:start position:0%
update my name on Election Day the
 
06:26:19.670 --> 06:26:19.680 align:start position:0%
person next to me thought he was
 
06:26:21.350 --> 06:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
registered had to wait in line and then
 
06:26:23.350 --> 06:26:23.360 align:start position:0%
wait in line to register um and this is
 
06:26:25.390 --> 06:26:25.400 align:start position:0%
a way to for some voters that meet the
 
06:26:27.868 --> 06:26:27.878 align:start position:0%
qualifications be able to register ahead
 
06:26:29.990 --> 06:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
of election day reduce those lines and
 
06:26:31.910 --> 06:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
reduce the number of folks who have to
 
06:26:33.948 --> 06:26:33.958 align:start position:0%
start and complete the whole process on
 
06:26:35.548 --> 06:26:35.558 align:start position:0%
election day especially during these
 
06:26:37.948 --> 06:26:37.958 align:start position:0%
busy elections um or when they don't
 
06:26:39.510 --> 06:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
vote for 2 years and their registration
 
06:26:42.030 --> 06:26:42.040 align:start position:0%
is inaccurate for that amount of time um
 
06:26:43.468 --> 06:26:43.478 align:start position:0%
wanted to talk a little bit through
 
06:26:44.628 --> 06:26:44.638 align:start position:0%
because I think there's just some
 
06:26:47.310 --> 06:26:47.320 align:start position:0%
clarification with how this bill is more
 
06:26:48.788 --> 06:26:48.798 align:start position:0%
specific this year than it's been in the
 
06:26:51.230 --> 06:26:51.240 align:start position:0%
past how this would work um so this
 
06:26:53.190 --> 06:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
system would only be for voters who have
 
06:26:55.150 --> 06:26:55.160 align:start position:0%
either New Hampshire license or New
 
06:26:58.110 --> 06:26:58.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire non voter ID um in other
 
06:26:59.430 --> 06:26:59.440 align:start position:0%
states people actually start this
 
06:27:01.310 --> 06:27:01.320 align:start position:0%
process by putting in their license or
 
06:27:04.468 --> 06:27:04.478 align:start position:0%
ID number so it connects directly to
 
06:27:06.310 --> 06:27:06.320 align:start position:0%
their profile um and make sure that they
 
06:27:09.270 --> 06:27:09.280 align:start position:0%
are the person they say they are uh then
 
06:27:11.270 --> 06:27:11.280 align:start position:0%
if the person had it would verify that
 
06:27:13.708 --> 06:27:13.718 align:start position:0%
their address on their license or with
 
06:27:16.270 --> 06:27:16.280 align:start position:0%
the DMV is the same as the address
 
06:27:18.390 --> 06:27:18.400 align:start position:0%
they're trying to register with it would
 
06:27:20.670 --> 06:27:20.680 align:start position:0%
then be required and this is would work
 
06:27:22.390 --> 06:27:22.400 align:start position:0%
for some people and not for some people
 
06:27:23.628 --> 06:27:23.638 align:start position:0%
they would still have to register in
 
06:27:26.350 --> 06:27:26.360 align:start position:0%
person because of the requirements of
 
06:27:29.110 --> 06:27:29.120 align:start position:0%
proving citizenship it would then PLL
 
06:27:31.548 --> 06:27:31.558 align:start position:0%
and see if in those State databases
 
06:27:33.310 --> 06:27:33.320 align:start position:0%
there was proof of citizenship so for
 
06:27:35.830 --> 06:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
example when I got my real ID I brought
 
06:27:39.030 --> 06:27:39.040 align:start position:0%
in my passport therefore with the DMV my
 
06:27:41.350 --> 06:27:41.360 align:start position:0%
proof of citizenship is on file if it
 
06:27:43.628 --> 06:27:43.638 align:start position:0%
could do that you would be it would pull
 
06:27:45.390 --> 06:27:45.400 align:start position:0%
your signature from your license you
 
06:27:48.390 --> 06:27:48.400 align:start position:0%
would be registered but need to Reg to
 
06:27:49.830 --> 06:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
fill out your signature in person at
 
06:27:52.510 --> 06:27:52.520 align:start position:0%
some point before you cast that ballot
 
06:27:55.190 --> 06:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
if uh either you didn't have a license
 
06:27:57.150 --> 06:27:57.160 align:start position:0%
if you were registering a new license or
 
06:27:59.628 --> 06:27:59.638 align:start position:0%
a new address but that address was not
 
06:28:02.350 --> 06:28:02.360 align:start position:0%
on your license if you didn't have proof
 
06:28:04.670 --> 06:28:04.680 align:start position:0%
of citizenship on file with the DMV for
 
06:28:06.510 --> 06:28:06.520 align:start position:0%
some reason you would get an email it
 
06:28:09.070 --> 06:28:09.080 align:start position:0%
says in this um in the bill that says
 
06:28:10.948 --> 06:28:10.958 align:start position:0%
you're we weren't able to process your
 
06:28:13.070 --> 06:28:13.080 align:start position:0%
online voter registration here are the
 
06:28:14.830 --> 06:28:14.840 align:start position:0%
other ways you can register so go to
 
06:28:17.390 --> 06:28:17.400 align:start position:0%
your clerk's office register on Election
 
06:28:19.670 --> 06:28:19.680 align:start position:0%
Day that way so it this ises not
 
06:28:21.750 --> 06:28:21.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily apply for everyone we know
 
06:28:23.110 --> 06:28:23.120 align:start position:0%
that not everyone has a New Hampshire
 
06:28:25.390 --> 06:28:25.400 align:start position:0%
license not everyone has used their
 
06:28:27.510 --> 06:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
proof of citizenship to get that but it
 
06:28:30.310 --> 06:28:30.320 align:start position:0%
is one more way to be able to have more
 
06:28:32.590 --> 06:28:32.600 align:start position:0%
folks register ahead of time um which is
 
06:28:34.430 --> 06:28:34.440 align:start position:0%
an important part of the process be able
 
06:28:36.310 --> 06:28:36.320 align:start position:0%
to cut back on those really long lines
 
06:28:38.350 --> 06:28:38.360 align:start position:0%
that we're seeing because so many people
 
06:28:41.150 --> 06:28:41.160 align:start position:0%
are participating um and to still be
 
06:28:43.230 --> 06:28:43.240 align:start position:0%
able to make sure ahead of time people
 
06:28:45.310 --> 06:28:45.320 align:start position:0%
are also you know meeting all of those
 
06:28:47.190 --> 06:28:47.200 align:start position:0%
criteria and probably in an easier way
 
06:28:49.070 --> 06:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
if they showed their passport once when
 
06:28:51.548 --> 06:28:51.558 align:start position:0%
they got their license um then they have
 
06:28:53.030 --> 06:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
it on file and they don't necessarily
 
06:28:55.030 --> 06:28:55.040 align:start position:0%
need to bring three or four documents
 
06:28:57.670 --> 06:28:57.680 align:start position:0%
with them in person um and to be able to
 
06:29:00.030 --> 06:29:00.040 align:start position:0%
have those either registrations started
 
06:29:01.868 --> 06:29:01.878 align:start position:0%
or again updated like if you're updating
 
06:29:03.910 --> 06:29:03.920 align:start position:0%
your name it's connected to your license
 
06:29:06.390 --> 06:29:06.400 align:start position:0%
um ahead of time on through the system
 
06:29:08.070 --> 06:29:08.080 align:start position:0%
so I am happy to answer any questions
 
06:29:10.430 --> 06:29:10.440 align:start position:0%
especially about um the time or kind of
 
06:29:12.590 --> 06:29:12.600 align:start position:0%
the process there or anything else other
 
06:29:14.110 --> 06:29:14.120 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
06:29:16.830 --> 06:29:16.840 align:start position:0%
representative Lane um thank you thanks
 
06:29:19.310 --> 06:29:19.320 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
06:29:22.670 --> 06:29:22.680 align:start position:0%
so previously on another bill uh
 
06:29:26.110 --> 06:29:26.120 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State indicated um that
 
06:29:29.830 --> 06:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
they have uh access and the archives to
 
06:29:32.350 --> 06:29:32.360 align:start position:0%
anyone who was born in New Hampshire so
 
06:29:34.948 --> 06:29:34.958 align:start position:0%
that would prove citizenship
 
06:29:39.390 --> 06:29:39.400 align:start position:0%
so does this bill would that when and I
 
06:29:40.628 --> 06:29:40.638 align:start position:0%
know it talks about
 
06:29:43.788 --> 06:29:43.798 align:start position:0%
DMV and I haven't read it word for as
 
06:29:45.350 --> 06:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
carefully maybe as I should have but
 
06:29:48.350 --> 06:29:48.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:51.390 --> 06:29:51.400 align:start position:0%
enable whoever the supervisor whoever to
 
06:29:53.628 --> 06:29:53.638 align:start position:0%
get into those records because anyone
 
06:29:55.030 --> 06:29:55.040 align:start position:0%
and I think he said it was about a third
 
06:29:57.310 --> 06:29:57.320 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire's voters so about a
 
06:29:59.070 --> 06:29:59.080 align:start position:0%
third of the voters would at least be
 
06:30:02.030 --> 06:30:02.040 align:start position:0%
able to get past the citizenship proof
 
06:30:05.350 --> 06:30:05.360 align:start position:0%
issue wouldn't help the rest of us who
 
06:30:08.510 --> 06:30:08.520 align:start position:0%
weren't born here but so is that your
 
06:30:10.030 --> 06:30:10.040 align:start position:0%
understanding or have you talked about
 
06:30:12.948 --> 06:30:12.958 align:start position:0%
that or is that something that might be
 
06:30:15.350 --> 06:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
feasible thanks for that question um I
 
06:30:17.750 --> 06:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
had not necessarily heard exactly that
 
06:30:20.110 --> 06:30:20.120 align:start position:0%
they had access to that in the bill as
 
06:30:22.750 --> 06:30:22.760 align:start position:0%
it's written right now it says um if
 
06:30:25.390 --> 06:30:25.400 align:start position:0%
they can be rectifi verified by the
 
06:30:27.230 --> 06:30:27.240 align:start position:0%
records of the Department of State or
 
06:30:30.590 --> 06:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
division of M vehicles um but if that
 
06:30:34.270 --> 06:30:34.280 align:start position:0%
added in also the state database for
 
06:30:35.948 --> 06:30:35.958 align:start position:0%
birth certificates or who was born there
 
06:30:38.230 --> 06:30:38.240 align:start position:0%
you know that might allow folks who have
 
06:30:40.388 --> 06:30:40.398 align:start position:0%
a license but didn't bring their birth
 
06:30:41.548 --> 06:30:41.558 align:start position:0%
certificate because they brought their
 
06:30:43.590 --> 06:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
social security card or something else
 
06:30:46.548 --> 06:30:46.558 align:start position:0%
um to verify that way okay as well all
 
06:30:49.350 --> 06:30:49.360 align:start position:0%
right seems like it's possible further
 
06:30:51.788 --> 06:30:51.798 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee seeing none
 
06:30:53.070 --> 06:30:53.080 align:start position:0%
thank you I don't have any other pink
 
06:30:55.910 --> 06:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
cards on the blue sheet there was three
 
06:30:58.830 --> 06:30:58.840 align:start position:0%
in support uh no opposed that signed up
 
06:30:59.910 --> 06:30:59.920 align:start position:0%
and didn't
 
06:31:04.708 --> 06:31:04.718 align:start position:0%
speak um and online it's actually
 
06:31:06.468 --> 06:31:06.478 align:start position:0%
probably our most highly contested Bill
 
06:31:10.070 --> 06:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
support 456 oppose 2370 neutral with
 
06:31:11.510 --> 06:31:11.520 align:start position:0%

06:31:13.628 --> 06:31:13.638 align:start position:0%
for House Bill 521 and we will start our
 
06:31:16.708 --> 06:31:16.718 align:start position:0%

something I don't know okay um thank you
 
06:32:18.708 --> 06:32:18.718 align:start position:0%
chairman Barry members of the House
 
06:32:20.910 --> 06:32:20.920 align:start position:0%
election law committee for the record
 
06:32:22.708 --> 06:32:22.718 align:start position:0%
again my name is kayy of stadio I'm a
 
06:32:24.670 --> 06:32:24.680 align:start position:0%
Durham voter and public policy fellow
 
06:32:25.708 --> 06:32:25.718 align:start position:0%
with open
 
06:32:28.628 --> 06:32:28.638 align:start position:0%
democracy and I'm testifying today in
 
06:32:30.388 --> 06:32:30.398 align:start position:0%
opposition to
 
06:32:32.548 --> 06:32:32.558 align:start position:0%
hb220 in a state where independent
 
06:32:34.430 --> 06:32:34.440 align:start position:0%
voters make up nearly 40 % of the
 
06:32:37.230 --> 06:32:37.240 align:start position:0%
electorate passing hb220 would blatantly
 
06:32:39.468 --> 06:32:39.478 align:start position:0%
disenfranchise countless Undeclared Gran
 
06:32:41.350 --> 06:32:41.360 align:start position:0%
stators who take great pride in voting
 
06:32:43.150 --> 06:32:43.160 align:start position:0%
despite not being as radical as their
 
06:32:45.788 --> 06:32:45.798 align:start position:0%
partisan counterparts additionally New
 
06:32:47.868 --> 06:32:47.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire taxpayers currently subsidize
 
06:32:49.830 --> 06:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
political party candidate selection for
 
06:32:52.430 --> 06:32:52.440 align:start position:0%
the two major parties re restricting
 
06:32:54.270 --> 06:32:54.280 align:start position:0%
Undeclared voters from primaries would
 
06:32:55.948 --> 06:32:55.958 align:start position:0%
only work to further ostracize and
 
06:32:58.070 --> 06:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
penalize these voters who themselves are
 
06:33:00.830 --> 06:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
the ones funding the elections primaries
 
06:33:02.830 --> 06:33:02.840 align:start position:0%
are also often the most consequential
 
06:33:05.548 --> 06:33:05.558 align:start position:0%
elections this meant that in 2022
 
06:33:07.910 --> 06:33:07.920 align:start position:0%
because 85% of congressional districts
 
06:33:10.310 --> 06:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
enclosed primary states were considered
 
06:33:12.548 --> 06:33:12.558 align:start position:0%
safe most independent voters were
 
06:33:14.670 --> 06:33:14.680 align:start position:0%
effectively left without any real voice
 
06:33:16.628 --> 06:33:16.638 align:start position:0%
at The Ballot Box during the general
 
06:33:19.030 --> 06:33:19.040 align:start position:0%
election according to the United America
 
06:33:21.670 --> 06:33:21.680 align:start position:0%
Institute 48% of Independents say they
 
06:33:23.948 --> 06:33:23.958 align:start position:0%
truly do not lean towards one party over
 
06:33:27.388 --> 06:33:27.398 align:start position:0%
another 26% were previously Democrats
 
06:33:30.270 --> 06:33:30.280 align:start position:0%
and 27% were previously
 
06:33:32.350 --> 06:33:32.360 align:start position:0%
Republicans the levels of malicious
 
06:33:34.110 --> 06:33:34.120 align:start position:0%
crossover voting are also not
 
06:33:36.030 --> 06:33:36.040 align:start position:0%
significant enough to Warrant silencing
 
06:33:38.670 --> 06:33:38.680 align:start position:0%
such a massive portion of constituents
 
06:33:40.548 --> 06:33:40.558 align:start position:0%
as chairman Barry duly noted last
 
06:33:43.468 --> 06:33:43.478 align:start position:0%
Tuesday when discussing HB 172 which
 
06:33:45.070 --> 06:33:45.080 align:start position:0%
would have restricted Undeclared voters
 
06:33:47.070 --> 06:33:47.080 align:start position:0%
from same day voting in presidential or
 
06:33:49.350 --> 06:33:49.360 align:start position:0%
state primaries even the most concerted
 
06:33:51.510 --> 06:33:51.520 align:start position:0%
efforts of bad faith actors on the left
 
06:33:52.990 --> 06:33:53.000 align:start position:0%
during last year's presidential
 
06:33:55.230 --> 06:33:55.240 align:start position:0%
primaries resulted in little impact on
 
06:33:57.750 --> 06:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
the Republican nominee ejecting all
 
06:33:59.510 --> 06:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
Undeclared voters from the primary would
 
06:34:01.910 --> 06:34:01.920 align:start position:0%
essentially be forfeiting 80% of votes
 
06:34:04.110 --> 06:34:04.120 align:start position:0%
casting good faith to go to go after the
 
06:34:06.230 --> 06:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
20% that could be considered to have
 
06:34:08.670 --> 06:34:08.680 align:start position:0%
been cast in bad faith for these reasons
 
06:34:11.310 --> 06:34:11.320 align:start position:0%
I urge you to vote hb220 in expedient to
 
06:34:12.948 --> 06:34:12.958 align:start position:0%
legislate and ensure New Hampshire
 
06:34:14.910 --> 06:34:14.920 align:start position:0%
continues to provide representations to
 
06:34:16.948 --> 06:34:16.958 align:start position:0%
all of its voters thank you and I'll
 
06:34:19.190 --> 06:34:19.200 align:start position:0%
take questions if there are any are
 
06:34:21.230 --> 06:34:21.240 align:start position:0%
there any questions from the
 
06:34:23.310 --> 06:34:23.320 align:start position:0%
Committee hearing none thank you we did
 
06:34:37.510 --> 06:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:39.190 --> 06:34:39.200 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm also speaking in
 
06:34:42.388 --> 06:34:42.398 align:start position:0%
opposition to hb220 FN I think the
 
06:34:44.628 --> 06:34:44.638 align:start position:0%
previous speaker covered it pretty well
 
06:34:49.830 --> 06:34:49.840 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to point out also that uh
 
06:34:52.948 --> 06:34:52.958 align:start position:0%
parties actually usually want to have
 
06:34:54.468 --> 06:34:54.478 align:start position:0%
independent voters vote it actually
 
06:34:57.230 --> 06:34:57.240 align:start position:0%
helps them it helps them helps
 
06:34:59.070 --> 06:34:59.080 align:start position:0%
independent helps them keep their power
 
06:35:02.070 --> 06:35:02.080 align:start position:0%
to be quite honest with you so if you
 
06:35:05.190 --> 06:35:05.200 align:start position:0%
decide to close these primaries whether
 
06:35:07.590 --> 06:35:07.600 align:start position:0%
I've said previously in other testimony
 
06:35:09.788 --> 06:35:09.798 align:start position:0%
that it's actually unconstitutional for
 
06:35:12.070 --> 06:35:12.080 align:start position:0%
the state to close the primaries against
 
06:35:14.190 --> 06:35:14.200 align:start position:0%
the party's wishes if the parties want
 
06:35:16.230 --> 06:35:16.240 align:start position:0%
you to close them then at the moment
 
06:35:19.190 --> 06:35:19.200 align:start position:0%
it's it's allowed but you're wake you
 
06:35:22.430 --> 06:35:22.440 align:start position:0%
would be waking up a a sleeping giant
 
06:35:25.430 --> 06:35:25.440 align:start position:0%
because independent voters outnumber the
 
06:35:27.350 --> 06:35:27.360 align:start position:0%
Republicans and the Democrats in the
 
06:35:31.270 --> 06:35:31.280 align:start position:0%
state and they're kind of uh sleeping
 
06:35:32.510 --> 06:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
right now because they feel like they
 
06:35:33.670 --> 06:35:33.680 align:start position:0%
get to participate in the process
 
06:35:36.030 --> 06:35:36.040 align:start position:0%
process but if they're cut out of a
 
06:35:38.270 --> 06:35:38.280 align:start position:0%
process that's being sponsored and
 
06:35:41.868 --> 06:35:41.878 align:start position:0%
funded by the state and they don't get a
 
06:35:43.468 --> 06:35:43.478 align:start position:0%
say even though it's the preliminary
 
06:35:45.150 --> 06:35:45.160 align:start position:0%
step in a general election which are
 
06:35:48.070 --> 06:35:48.080 align:start position:0%
public elections I I can I can bet you
 
06:35:50.670 --> 06:35:50.680 align:start position:0%
that you're going to have uh a big
 
06:35:52.948 --> 06:35:52.958 align:start position:0%
movement of independent voters so we'll
 
06:35:54.628 --> 06:35:54.638 align:start position:0%
see what happens I hope you oppose this
 
06:35:57.230 --> 06:35:57.240 align:start position:0%
bill because we do want to have a say
 
06:35:59.388 --> 06:35:59.398 align:start position:0%
and if somehow this bill passes well
 
06:36:01.468 --> 06:36:01.478 align:start position:0%
we'll get busy that's all I have to say
 
06:36:04.510 --> 06:36:04.520 align:start position:0%
thank you okay well you be making
 
06:36:06.788 --> 06:36:06.798 align:start position:0%
questions yes if you have any are there
 
06:36:08.990 --> 06:36:09.000 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
06:36:11.110 --> 06:36:11.120 align:start position:0%
Gilmore don't you think this might
 
06:36:13.070 --> 06:36:13.080 align:start position:0%
impact New Hampshire's presidential
 
06:36:15.990 --> 06:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
primary if it were to keep independence
 
06:36:17.388 --> 06:36:17.398 align:start position:0%
from voting in
 
06:36:19.990 --> 06:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
it yes uh a big part of the New
 
06:36:22.388 --> 06:36:22.398 align:start position:0%
Hampshire presidential primary is that
 
06:36:24.110 --> 06:36:24.120 align:start position:0%
everyone's interested in in what what
 
06:36:26.070 --> 06:36:26.080 align:start position:0%
the independent voters are going to do
 
06:36:27.990 --> 06:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
and it's what's one of the big the big
 
06:36:31.468 --> 06:36:31.478 align:start position:0%
parts of this being a a good place for
 
06:36:34.230 --> 06:36:34.240 align:start position:0%
the first of the nation primary
 
06:36:36.708 --> 06:36:36.718 align:start position:0%
because it it's one of the states with
 
06:36:38.150 --> 06:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
the highest number of independent voters
 
06:36:39.388 --> 06:36:39.398 align:start position:0%
and we're known as being a very
 
06:36:41.948 --> 06:36:41.958 align:start position:0%
independent state so if if the
 
06:36:43.548 --> 06:36:43.558 align:start position:0%
independent voters don't have a say
 
06:36:45.350 --> 06:36:45.360 align:start position:0%
we're not going to have any voice as
 
06:36:47.868 --> 06:36:47.878 align:start position:0%
being such a small state as we are thank
 
06:36:50.110 --> 06:36:50.120 align:start position:0%
you further questions from the committee
 
06:36:52.468 --> 06:36:52.478 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you um I don't have
 
06:36:55.270 --> 06:36:55.280 align:start position:0%
anyone else other know the pink cards um
 
06:36:57.670 --> 06:36:57.680 align:start position:0%
on the blue sheet was zero in support
 
06:36:59.510 --> 06:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
four against and
 
06:37:02.708 --> 06:37:02.718 align:start position:0%
online was pretty lopsided 11 in support
 
06:37:04.510 --> 06:37:04.520 align:start position:0%
340 opposed zero neutral with that we
 
06:37:06.948 --> 06:37:06.958 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing House Bill 220
 
06:37:08.150 --> 06:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
that concludes our public hearings for
 
06:37:11.230 --> 06:37:11.240 align:start position:0%
the day uh I do need reports from last
 
06:37:13.350 --> 06:37:13.360 align:start position:0%
week I don't think I saw them come
 
06:37:16.430 --> 06:37:16.440 align:start position:0%
through um from anyone just to be fair
 
06:37:17.910 --> 06:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
like it's not that's not a condemnation
 
06:37:19.548 --> 06:37:19.558 align:start position:0%
of either side like I didn't see any
 
06:37:21.190 --> 06:37:21.200 align:start position:0%
them come
 
06:37:25.230 --> 06:37:25.240 align:start position:0%
through yeah but but I do need them uh
 
06:37:27.468 --> 06:37:27.478 align:start position:0%
tonight from the ones from last week so
 
06:37:30.270 --> 06:37:30.280 align:start position:0%
that I can put them on or try to put
 
06:37:34.590 --> 06:37:34.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:36.590 --> 06:37:36.600 align:start position:0%
I'm going to make the deadline so um
 
06:37:38.430 --> 06:37:38.440 align:start position:0%
anyway so if you owe reports please do
 
06:37:40.670 --> 06:37:40.680 align:start position:0%
that otherwise uh I will Author them and
 
06:37:43.430 --> 06:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
who knows you know maybe maybe I do a
 
06:37:45.310 --> 06:37:45.320 align:start position:0%
good job maybe I don't who knows so
 
06:37:50.830 --> 06:37:50.840 align:start position:0%
could I just a point of order um many of
 
06:37:52.750 --> 06:37:52.760 align:start position:0%
four of these bills that we heard today
 
06:37:55.750 --> 06:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
are ones that we don't often hear yes
 
06:37:57.830 --> 06:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
about so keep talking the mic just a
 
06:38:01.230 --> 06:38:01.240 align:start position:0%
little more is there is there a way and
 
06:38:03.230 --> 06:38:03.240 align:start position:0%
our poor researcher in the back there
 
06:38:03.240 --> 06:38:04.030 align:start position:0%
our poor researcher in the back there
but

06:38:04.030 --> 06:38:04.040 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:38:06.548 --> 06:38:06.558 align:start position:0%
um that we could get more information
 
06:38:08.230 --> 06:38:08.240 align:start position:0%
whether it's research or more
 
06:38:10.830 --> 06:38:10.840 align:start position:0%
information about CU I'm just not
 
06:38:14.590 --> 06:38:14.600 align:start position:0%
familiar enough with these processes to
 
06:38:16.510 --> 06:38:16.520 align:start position:0%
make an intelligent
 
06:38:18.468 --> 06:38:18.478 align:start position:0%
decision I mean if you have a specific
 
06:38:20.030 --> 06:38:20.040 align:start position:0%
question I'm happy to I haven't denied
 
06:38:21.510 --> 06:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
anything to the researcher yet from a
 
06:38:22.948 --> 06:38:22.958 align:start position:0%
request from a member so if you have a
 
06:38:25.270 --> 06:38:25.280 align:start position:0%
specific question I just I guess I I
 
06:38:27.230 --> 06:38:27.240 align:start position:0%
don't know what to ask of the researcher
 
06:38:28.868 --> 06:38:28.878 align:start position:0%
I'm stumbling because I can't either
 
06:38:30.230 --> 06:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
yeah um if you have something send to me
 
06:38:32.350 --> 06:38:32.360 align:start position:0%
I haven't denied anything um I I think I
 
06:38:33.788 --> 06:38:33.798 align:start position:0%
actually made my first request request
 
06:38:37.350 --> 06:38:37.360 align:start position:0%
of the researcher today um my my first
 
06:38:39.468 --> 06:38:39.478 align:start position:0%
so um you know if if you have anything
 
06:38:41.548 --> 06:38:41.558 align:start position:0%
you know I I I haven't turned anything
 
06:38:42.628 --> 06:38:42.638 align:start position:0%
down I reserved the right to turn
 
06:38:43.750 --> 06:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
something down if it's you know
 
06:38:46.110 --> 06:38:46.120 align:start position:0%
unreasonable but I haven't seen anything
 
06:38:48.510 --> 06:38:48.520 align:start position:0%
yet been requested that I think even
 
06:38:49.830 --> 06:38:49.840 align:start position:0%
approached something that was
 
06:38:52.948 --> 06:38:52.958 align:start position:0%
unreasonable okay um so I guess is that
 
06:38:55.430 --> 06:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
the best way to answer the question okay
 
06:38:56.910 --> 06:38:56.920 align:start position:0%
I'll try and articulate it better next
 
06:38:59.310 --> 06:38:59.320 align:start position:0%
time yeah sort of and I I no one took my
 
06:39:01.628 --> 06:39:01.638 align:start position:0%
vote for the rank Choice voting
 
06:39:04.948 --> 06:39:04.958 align:start position:0%
but and I I and you know I'm I'm excited
 
06:39:06.830 --> 06:39:06.840 align:start position:0%
I want you to see what regular ballots
 
06:39:09.150 --> 06:39:09.160 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire look like so good luck
 
06:39:12.150 --> 06:39:12.160 align:start position:0%
good luck
 
06:39:12.160 --> 06:39:16.430 align:start position:0%
good luck
um

06:39:16.430 --> 06:39:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:21.230 --> 06:39:21.240 align:start position:0%
go go for uh so uh we will be meeting
 
06:39:23.030 --> 06:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
next Tuesday there will be votes next
 
06:39:25.788 --> 06:39:25.798 align:start position:0%
Tuesday I think we have like seven
 
06:39:28.708 --> 06:39:28.718 align:start position:0%
hearings left um the committee assistant
 
06:39:30.430 --> 06:39:30.440 align:start position:0%
is getting me the list just so that her
 
06:39:33.030 --> 06:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
and I are on the same page um but I I'm
 
06:39:35.190 --> 06:39:35.200 align:start position:0%
thinking that going forward our our
 
06:39:37.548 --> 06:39:37.558 align:start position:0%
committee days will look more like
 
06:39:40.110 --> 06:39:40.120 align:start position:0%
regular committees do and not
 
06:39:43.670 --> 06:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
the uh go go go go go so um with that
 
06:39:45.030 --> 06:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
we'll be I'll see you next Tuesday I
 
06:39:47.910 --> 06:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
won't see you on Thursday um and yeah
