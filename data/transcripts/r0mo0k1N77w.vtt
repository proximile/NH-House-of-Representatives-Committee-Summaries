they started opening the zoom individual

Zooms in the room the microphone started
 
00:23:22.549 --> 00:23:22.559 align:start position:0%
to get worse so would I make a
 
00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
suggestion to have everybody that is
 
00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:29.960 align:start position:0%
not the main computer to log out of zoom

just have
 
00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:13.560 align:start position:0%
to either turn the volume up or just be
 
00:38:15.150 --> 00:38:15.160 align:start position:0%
a little bit louder but we can hear the

01:23:12.550 --> 01:23:12.560 align:start position:0%
Christina I believe he's looking to
 
01:23:15.350 --> 01:23:15.360 align:start position:0%
um at one o' but I'm going to verify
 
01:23:18.229 --> 01:23:18.239 align:start position:0%
before we go anywhere I I just had a
 
01:23:21.070 --> 01:23:21.080 align:start position:0%
thought like what if we all left and
 
01:23:26.110 --> 01:23:26.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:29.910 --> 01:23:29.920 align:start position:0%
meeting maybe it's a zoom issue today
 
01:23:32.550 --> 01:23:32.560 align:start position:0%
it's what it's working in in the other
 
01:23:36.629 --> 01:23:36.639 align:start position:0%
committee rooms oh okay um so I think he
 
01:23:38.950 --> 01:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
wants to reconvene at one o'clock let me
 
01:23:42.470 --> 01:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
just verify before anybody
 
01:23:44.870 --> 01:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
goes when I logged in this morning to
 
01:23:48.430 --> 01:23:48.440 align:start position:0%
zoom it uh it took forever so I had to
 
01:23:50.510 --> 01:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
uh shut down my computer start up and
 
01:23:52.870 --> 01:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
use a different uh issue of Zoom Zoom I
 
01:23:55.189 --> 01:23:55.199 align:start position:0%
guess and which is fine so it's
 
01:23:57.070 --> 01:23:57.080 align:start position:0%
certainly possible that what's happening
 
01:24:21.350 --> 01:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:51.350 align:start position:0%
 
connection

01:24:51.350 --> 01:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:51.360 --> 01:25:14.830 align:start position:0%
 
should

01:25:14.830 --> 01:25:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:19.390 --> 01:25:19.400 align:start position:0%
it wasn't clear to me um whether will
 
01:25:20.830 --> 01:25:20.840 align:start position:0%
was ready
 
01:25:23.030 --> 01:25:23.040 align:start position:0%

01:25:51.280 --> 01:26:21.189 align:start position:0%

requires employers to provide employees

the opportunity to earn a minimum amount
 
01:56:08.830 --> 01:56:08.840 align:start position:0%
of paid sick

have access to earn paid
 
01:57:13.629 --> 01:57:13.639 align:start position:0%
time this bill would ensure people who
 
01:57:16.189 --> 01:57:16.199 align:start position:0%
are employed in New Hampshire earn at
 
01:57:21.030 --> 01:57:21.040 align:start position:0%
least one hour of paid sick time for
 
01:57:24.310 --> 01:57:24.320 align:start position:0%
every 30 hours they
 
01:57:27.430 --> 01:57:27.440 align:start position:0%
work the maximum time anyone would be
 
01:57:30.750 --> 01:57:30.760 align:start position:0%
guaranteed in a year would be 72
 
01:57:33.870 --> 01:57:33.880 align:start position:0%
hours the bill would not impact anyone
 
01:57:36.950 --> 01:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
currently offering an equivalent or more
 
01:57:40.470 --> 01:57:40.480 align:start position:0%
generous amounts of paid time off that
 
01:57:43.790 --> 01:57:43.800 align:start position:0%
can be used for qualifying res reasons
 
01:57:48.229 --> 01:57:48.239 align:start position:0%
which include one's own sickness injury
 
01:57:50.669 --> 01:57:50.679 align:start position:0%
need for medical d diagnosis or
 
01:57:53.149 --> 01:57:53.159 align:start position:0%
preventive care or that of a family
 
01:57:56.149 --> 01:57:56.159 align:start position:0%
members as defined by the statute it
 
01:57:58.830 --> 01:57:58.840 align:start position:0%
would also enable the sick time to be
 
01:58:01.709 --> 01:58:01.719 align:start position:0%
used for absences necessary due to
 
01:58:04.669 --> 01:58:04.679 align:start position:0%
sexual assault or domestic violence and
 
01:58:08.589 --> 01:58:08.599 align:start position:0%
for public health emergencies related to
 
01:58:11.189 --> 01:58:11.199 align:start position:0%
closures the bill would also ensure
 
01:58:13.790 --> 01:58:13.800 align:start position:0%
working people are protected from
 
01:58:18.310 --> 01:58:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:21.390 --> 01:58:21.400 align:start position:0%
off I would guess one of the concerns
 
01:58:24.189 --> 01:58:24.199 align:start position:0%
you'll hear is about whether or not it's
 
01:58:27.270 --> 01:58:27.280 align:start position:0%
our business to have any say in what
 
01:58:29.229 --> 01:58:29.239 align:start position:0%
employers offer for
 
01:58:31.550 --> 01:58:31.560 align:start position:0%
benefits when we leave it up to
 
01:58:34.589 --> 01:58:34.599 align:start position:0%
businesses we end up with working people
 
01:58:37.069 --> 01:58:37.079 align:start position:0%
least likely to be able to afford
 
01:58:39.990 --> 01:58:40.000 align:start position:0%
missing a day's wages least likely to
 
01:58:41.990 --> 01:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
have paid time
 
01:58:46.470 --> 01:58:46.480 align:start position:0%
off we need to set a minimum floor to
 
01:58:49.510 --> 01:58:49.520 align:start position:0%
ensure all working people have some
 
01:58:52.030 --> 01:58:52.040 align:start position:0%
ability to take time to care for
 
01:58:55.830 --> 01:58:55.840 align:start position:0%
themselves or their family when they are
 
01:58:59.030 --> 01:58:59.040 align:start position:0%
sick if we've learned anything from the
 
01:59:01.510 --> 01:59:01.520 align:start position:0%
pandemic it's that it's the public in
 
01:59:03.990 --> 01:59:04.000 align:start position:0%
the Public's best interest for people
 
01:59:06.270 --> 01:59:06.280 align:start position:0%
who are sick to stay
 
01:59:08.669 --> 01:59:08.679 align:start position:0%
home and it is in the Public's best
 
01:59:11.430 --> 01:59:11.440 align:start position:0%
interest for children who are sick to be
 
01:59:14.350 --> 01:59:14.360 align:start position:0%
able to stay home from school or child
 
01:59:17.149 --> 01:59:17.159 align:start position:0%
care in order to limit the spread of
 
01:59:20.750 --> 01:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
contagious disease I ran a child care
 
01:59:23.990 --> 01:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
agencies for Agency for 45 years and
 
01:59:27.589 --> 01:59:27.599 align:start position:0%
that gave me an upfront um and close
 
01:59:30.390 --> 01:59:30.400 align:start position:0%
look at what happens when people don't
 
01:59:34.069 --> 01:59:34.079 align:start position:0%
have access to paid sick days they go to
 
01:59:36.910 --> 01:59:36.920 align:start position:0%
work sick and that means that they drop
 
01:59:39.229 --> 01:59:39.239 align:start position:0%
their children off sick at child care or
 
01:59:39.239 --> 01:59:39.950 align:start position:0%
their children off sick at child care or
at

01:59:39.950 --> 01:59:39.960 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:59:42.910 --> 01:59:42.920 align:start position:0%
school nobody wants to send a sick child
 
01:59:45.310 --> 01:59:45.320 align:start position:0%
to school they do it because they have
 
01:59:48.270 --> 01:59:48.280 align:start position:0%
to because they can't make ends meet if
 
01:59:50.589 --> 01:59:50.599 align:start position:0%
they miss a day of work
 
01:59:53.790 --> 01:59:53.800 align:start position:0%
work this bill will make sure no one has
 
01:59:56.229 --> 01:59:56.239 align:start position:0%
to choose between a day's pay and
 
01:59:58.830 --> 01:59:58.840 align:start position:0%
staying home when they or their children
 
02:00:03.550 --> 02:00:03.560 align:start position:0%
are sick thank you Mr um chair and I'll

you
 
02:00:41.350 --> 02:00:41.360 align:start position:0%
um how will this bill benefit small
 
02:00:45.030 --> 02:00:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:49.589 --> 02:00:49.599 align:start position:0%
you um thank you uh representative bard
 
02:00:52.030 --> 02:00:52.040 align:start position:0%
well I think you know there are a number
 
02:00:54.750 --> 02:00:54.760 align:start position:0%
of ways that businesses will also um
 
02:00:57.390 --> 02:00:57.400 align:start position:0%
benefit from having a minimum amount of
 
02:01:00.470 --> 02:01:00.480 align:start position:0%
sick time available to their employees
 
02:01:04.910 --> 02:01:04.920 align:start position:0%
um as an employer myself for I 45 years
 
02:01:11.910 --> 02:01:11.920 align:start position:0%
I I know that um I it was when someone
 
02:01:13.669 --> 02:01:13.679 align:start position:0%
came to work who was
 
02:01:16.709 --> 02:01:16.719 align:start position:0%
sick other people then were sick and
 
02:01:19.709 --> 02:01:19.719 align:start position:0%
then I would end up with an issue where
 
02:01:23.030 --> 02:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
I would have my Workforce I'd have a lot
 
02:01:26.030 --> 02:01:26.040 align:start position:0%
of my workforce out so the benefit for
 
02:01:28.629 --> 02:01:28.639 align:start position:0%
people to be able to not come in sick
 
02:01:31.030 --> 02:01:31.040 align:start position:0%
and not spread the not spread contagious
 
02:01:34.669 --> 02:01:34.679 align:start position:0%
disease is obviously very important I
 
02:01:36.550 --> 02:01:36.560 align:start position:0%
also think it's really good for
 
02:01:38.470 --> 02:01:38.480 align:start position:0%
retention of employees I think when
 
02:01:41.950 --> 02:01:41.960 align:start position:0%
employees are looking for work they're
 
02:01:43.990 --> 02:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
looking for obviously the best wage they
 
02:01:46.229 --> 02:01:46.239 align:start position:0%
can find they're looking for good
 
02:01:49.629 --> 02:01:49.639 align:start position:0%
working conditions and having at least a
 
02:01:52.350 --> 02:01:52.360 align:start position:0%
minimum amount of sick time available I
 
02:01:58.229 --> 02:01:58.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:00.229 --> 02:02:00.239 align:start position:0%

02:02:50.430 --> 02:02:50.440 align:start position:0%
hear I'm I'm sorry I did notar hear the
 
02:02:54.870 --> 02:02:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:54.880 --> 02:02:56.470 align:start position:0%
 
now

02:02:56.470 --> 02:02:56.480 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:03:00.350 --> 02:03:00.360 align:start position:0%

02:03:06.629 --> 02:03:06.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:09.589 --> 02:03:09.599 align:start position:0%
people well I don't think that it will
 
02:03:12.390 --> 02:03:12.400 align:start position:0%
it will affect um self-employed people I
 
02:03:15.310 --> 02:03:15.320 align:start position:0%
think that self-employed people um end
 
02:03:17.750 --> 02:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
up having to make their own decisions
 
02:03:19.750 --> 02:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
about um
 
02:03:24.390 --> 02:03:24.400 align:start position:0%
their ability to work when they are um
 
02:03:27.270 --> 02:03:27.280 align:start position:0%
maybe when they are not feeling feeling
 
02:03:30.030 --> 02:03:30.040 align:start position:0%
well and um they have to write that into
 
02:03:32.430 --> 02:03:32.440 align:start position:0%
sort of their business plan uh there
 
02:03:35.030 --> 02:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
would probably be there this would not
 
02:03:42.109 --> 02:03:42.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:44.549 --> 02:03:44.559 align:start position:0%

details relating to domestic violence
 
02:05:28.589 --> 02:05:28.599 align:start position:0%
sexual assault or stalking or the
 
02:05:31.950 --> 02:05:31.960 align:start position:0%
details of an employes medical condition
 
02:05:34.270 --> 02:05:34.280 align:start position:0%
as a condition of being provided paid
 
02:05:36.350 --> 02:05:36.360 align:start position:0%
sick time under this chapter If an
 
02:05:38.709 --> 02:05:38.719 align:start position:0%
employer possesses health information or
 
02:05:40.549 --> 02:05:40.559 align:start position:0%
information pertaining to domestic
 
02:05:43.310 --> 02:05:43.320 align:start position:0%
violence sexual assault or stalking

about an employee or an employees family
 
02:05:48.470 --> 02:05:48.480 align:start position:0%
member such information shall be treated
 
02:05:51.629 --> 02:05:51.639 align:start position:0%
as confidential and not disclosed except
 
02:05:53.629 --> 02:05:53.639 align:start position:0%
to the affected employee or with the
 
02:05:56.229 --> 02:05:56.239 align:start position:0%
permission of the affected
 
02:05:59.030 --> 02:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
employee and so I point that out because
 
02:06:02.310 --> 02:06:02.320 align:start position:0%
I it it's important to reme to um I want
 
02:06:05.470 --> 02:06:05.480 align:start position:0%
to draw attention to the people who
 
02:06:09.390 --> 02:06:09.400 align:start position:0%
would benefit so very very greatly from
 
02:06:13.870 --> 02:06:13.880 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to use paid sick time to
 
02:06:16.549 --> 02:06:16.559 align:start position:0%
deal with these issues paid sick and
 
02:06:19.510 --> 02:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
safe days would protect the paychecks of
 
02:06:22.109 --> 02:06:22.119 align:start position:0%
survivors of domestic violence sexual
 
02:06:24.350 --> 02:06:24.360 align:start position:0%
assault or stalking when they need to
 
02:06:26.350 --> 02:06:26.360 align:start position:0%
take time off from their jobs to get
 
02:06:29.709 --> 02:06:29.719 align:start position:0%
medical care support services enact a
 
02:06:31.510 --> 02:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
safety plan to get away from their
 
02:06:34.149 --> 02:06:34.159 align:start position:0%
perpetrator and if they choose go to
 
02:06:37.350 --> 02:06:37.360 align:start position:0%
court Seeking Justice in my work for the
 
02:06:40.149 --> 02:06:40.159 align:start position:0%
last nine years as a volunteer advocate
 
02:06:41.950 --> 02:06:41.960 align:start position:0%
for one of New Hampshire's crisis
 
02:06:44.870 --> 02:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
response Cent centers I've been to the
 
02:06:48.069 --> 02:06:48.079 align:start position:0%
hospital emergency departments dozens of
 
02:06:50.350 --> 02:06:50.360 align:start position:0%
times to to support survivors of sexual
 
02:06:53.069 --> 02:06:53.079 align:start position:0%
assault the first time a Survivor told
 
02:06:55.870 --> 02:06:55.880 align:start position:0%
me they had to go to work right after
 
02:06:58.430 --> 02:06:58.440 align:start position:0%
their forensic medical exam was
 
02:07:00.510 --> 02:07:00.520 align:start position:0%
complete and that they had been
 
02:07:02.870 --> 02:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
administered a powerful cocktail of
 
02:07:05.310 --> 02:07:05.320 align:start position:0%
prophylactic drugs to ad address
 
02:07:07.669 --> 02:07:07.679 align:start position:0%
possible exposures to sexually
 
02:07:11.950 --> 02:07:11.960 align:start position:0%
transmitted infections I was crushed for
 
02:07:16.669 --> 02:07:16.679 align:start position:0%
them just shook that they were not
 
02:07:19.990 --> 02:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
able to take that time off after such a
 
02:07:22.109 --> 02:07:22.119 align:start position:0%
traumatic event because they couldn't
 
02:07:24.950 --> 02:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
afford to lose the paycheck many of my
 
02:07:26.709 --> 02:07:26.719 align:start position:0%
fellow Advocates have accompanied
 
02:07:28.629 --> 02:07:28.639 align:start position:0%
survivors to court where they're
 
02:07:30.750 --> 02:07:30.760 align:start position:0%
applying for restraining orders against
 
02:07:30.760 --> 02:07:31.629 align:start position:0%
applying for restraining orders against
their

02:07:31.629 --> 02:07:31.639 align:start position:0%
their
 
02:07:34.149 --> 02:07:34.159 align:start position:0%
abusers Advocates are frustrated for
 
02:07:35.950 --> 02:07:35.960 align:start position:0%
their clients seeing them check their
 
02:07:38.149 --> 02:07:38.159 align:start position:0%
watches while they're sitting in court
 
02:07:40.750 --> 02:07:40.760 align:start position:0%
waiting to be called knowing that those
 
02:07:43.069 --> 02:07:43.079 align:start position:0%
survivors can't afford to miss a work
 
02:07:45.870 --> 02:07:45.880 align:start position:0%
shift no no matter how how far behind
 
02:07:47.030 --> 02:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
the courts
 
02:07:49.750 --> 02:07:49.760 align:start position:0%

almost 8 million days of paid work each
 
02:08:02.790 --> 02:08:02.800 align:start position:0%
year because of interpersonal violence
 
02:08:04.589 --> 02:08:04.599 align:start position:0%
survivors in New Hampshire who are
 
02:08:07.310 --> 02:08:07.320 align:start position:0%
employed in jobs with no benefits and
 
02:08:10.830 --> 02:08:10.840 align:start position:0%
unforgiving leave policies feel the tide
 
02:08:12.830 --> 02:08:12.840 align:start position:0%
pulling them under as they struggle to
 
02:08:15.030 --> 02:08:15.040 align:start position:0%
cope with an abusive household
 
02:08:17.510 --> 02:08:17.520 align:start position:0%

recovering from abuse no victim in New
 
02:08:30.830 --> 02:08:30.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire should have to choose between
 
02:08:32.950 --> 02:08:32.960 align:start position:0%
losing a paycheck or going to the
 
02:08:35.030 --> 02:08:35.040 align:start position:0%

thousands of survivors of sexual assault

02:09:19.870 --> 02:09:19.880 align:start position:0%
this morning
 
02:09:21.910 --> 02:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative any
 
02:09:28.430 --> 02:09:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:33.030 --> 02:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
Zoom seeing none any in the committee
 
02:09:35.470 --> 02:09:35.480 align:start position:0%
room representative this is will
 
02:09:37.629 --> 02:09:37.639 align:start position:0%
infantine I do have a question for you
 
02:09:40.430 --> 02:09:40.440 align:start position:0%
um in reading this bill obviously is
 
02:09:42.870 --> 02:09:42.880 align:start position:0%
there things I like and don't like but I
 
02:09:45.549 --> 02:09:45.559 align:start position:0%
really did like section on page six
 
02:09:48.629 --> 02:09:48.639 align:start position:0%
section 9 through 15 or 9 through 14 or
 
02:09:51.750 --> 02:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
regarding um domestic violence sexual
 
02:09:53.270 --> 02:09:53.280 align:start position:0%
assault or stalking and the question I
 
02:09:55.270 --> 02:09:55.280 align:start position:0%
have for you is
 
02:10:00.629 --> 02:10:00.639 align:start position:0%
just how does this work um how do
 
02:10:04.069 --> 02:10:04.079 align:start position:0%
you tell your employer you have a
 
02:10:05.870 --> 02:10:05.880 align:start position:0%
situation like this
 
02:10:08.189 --> 02:10:08.199 align:start position:0%
without having to tell your employer you
 
02:10:09.669 --> 02:10:09.679 align:start position:0%
have a situation like
 
02:10:12.270 --> 02:10:12.280 align:start position:0%
this well actually I'm I'm really glad
 
02:10:14.910 --> 02:10:14.920 align:start position:0%
you asked that question thank you um
 
02:10:19.149 --> 02:10:19.159 align:start position:0%
because you know ideally you don't don't
 
02:10:22.069 --> 02:10:22.079 align:start position:0%
and the idea is that paid sick time
 
02:10:24.830 --> 02:10:24.840 align:start position:0%
you've earned that paid sick time or
 
02:10:28.149 --> 02:10:28.159 align:start position:0%
safe time and you can use it exactly for
 
02:10:30.390 --> 02:10:30.400 align:start position:0%
those purposes now we do have
 
02:10:33.830 --> 02:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
Protections in New Hampshire that um if
 
02:10:36.950 --> 02:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
a Survivor discloses to their employer
 
02:10:40.750 --> 02:10:40.760 align:start position:0%
they cannot be retaliated against um and
 
02:10:44.149 --> 02:10:44.159 align:start position:0%
they they have to be um accommodated for
 
02:10:47.950 --> 02:10:47.960 align:start position:0%
instance if a perpetrator is uh stalking
 
02:10:47.960 --> 02:10:49.350 align:start position:0%
instance if a perpetrator is uh stalking
their

02:10:49.350 --> 02:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
their
 
02:10:53.310 --> 02:10:53.320 align:start position:0%
their victim at work um of an employer
 
02:10:55.910 --> 02:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
cannot fire that
 
02:10:59.189 --> 02:10:59.199 align:start position:0%
employee for being a victim of stalking
 
02:11:02.149 --> 02:11:02.159 align:start position:0%
so we have those Protections in place
 
02:11:06.870 --> 02:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
and the reason we have um this space in
 
02:11:09.950 --> 02:11:09.960 align:start position:0%
and on page five and you're looking at
 
02:11:09.960 --> 02:11:11.270 align:start position:0%
and on page five and you're looking at
employee

02:11:11.270 --> 02:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
employee
 
02:11:13.990 --> 02:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
records that when an employee does
 
02:11:17.229 --> 02:11:17.239 align:start position:0%
disclose to an employer that they're
 
02:11:22.350 --> 02:11:22.360 align:start position:0%
having this is their issue um just as an
 
02:11:24.750 --> 02:11:24.760 align:start position:0%
employee might disclose to their
 
02:11:27.109 --> 02:11:27.119 align:start position:0%
employer that they need to take medical
 
02:11:29.189 --> 02:11:29.199 align:start position:0%
time off but they may not disclose all
 
02:11:31.790 --> 02:11:31.800 align:start position:0%
the details like I may need to tell you
 
02:11:33.629 --> 02:11:33.639 align:start position:0%
I need to take some medical time but I'm
 
02:11:35.510 --> 02:11:35.520 align:start position:0%
not going to give you the details of my
 
02:11:38.510 --> 02:11:38.520 align:start position:0%
cancer diagnosis um I would tell you
 
02:11:41.669 --> 02:11:41.679 align:start position:0%
that I need to take time off because I'm
 
02:11:44.030 --> 02:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
experiencing um some interpersonal
 
02:11:46.470 --> 02:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
violence I might say domestic violence I
 
02:11:48.310 --> 02:11:48.320 align:start position:0%
might say I was the victim of sexual
 
02:11:50.390 --> 02:11:50.400 align:start position:0%
assault but then I've now put you in the
 
02:11:51.589 --> 02:11:51.599 align:start position:0%
position of having to keep that
 
02:11:53.589 --> 02:11:53.599 align:start position:0%
confidential and I might not want to
 
02:11:56.350 --> 02:11:56.360 align:start position:0%
have to do that to you um so there's a
 
02:11:58.790 --> 02:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
little bit of flexibility in there in
 
02:12:04.189 --> 02:12:04.199 align:start position:0%
that um employees May
 
02:12:07.830 --> 02:12:07.840 align:start position:0%
disclose but they don't have to give you
 
02:12:10.669 --> 02:12:10.679 align:start position:0%
all of the details does that make sense
 
02:12:14.189 --> 02:12:14.199 align:start position:0%
it does thank you okay like I might want
 
02:12:17.069 --> 02:12:17.079 align:start position:0%
not want to go through all of the
 
02:12:20.270 --> 02:12:20.280 align:start position:0%
specifics of my abuse just to tell you
 
02:12:22.990 --> 02:12:23.000 align:start position:0%
that I've experienced this and I need to
 
02:12:24.709 --> 02:12:24.719 align:start position:0%
take this time because I'm going to
 
02:12:28.390 --> 02:12:28.400 align:start position:0%
court or I have to go to the
 
02:12:30.629 --> 02:12:30.639 align:start position:0%
hospital thank you representative I
 
02:12:33.470 --> 02:12:33.480 align:start position:0%

us

02:12:49.589 --> 02:12:49.599 align:start position:0%
us
 
02:12:52.270 --> 02:12:52.280 align:start position:0%

you very well thank you go ahead great
 
02:12:59.629 --> 02:12:59.639 align:start position:0%
great thank you um I am tempted to um
 
02:13:03.189 --> 02:13:03.199 align:start position:0%
tell stories from constituents uh I
 
02:13:05.990 --> 02:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
represent a part of conquer that has a
 
02:13:08.549 --> 02:13:08.559 align:start position:0%
number of people who earn low wages work
 
02:13:11.270 --> 02:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
at the big box stores at the grocery
 
02:13:15.310 --> 02:13:15.320 align:start position:0%
store service industry Etc instead I
 
02:13:18.229 --> 02:13:18.239 align:start position:0%
would like to suggest we think of this
 
02:13:21.390 --> 02:13:21.400 align:start position:0%
topic for selfish reasons and I'm G to
 
02:13:24.069 --> 02:13:24.079 align:start position:0%
flip the script on some actual stories
 
02:13:27.069 --> 02:13:27.079 align:start position:0%
that I have heard from workers in our
 
02:13:30.629 --> 02:13:30.639 align:start position:0%
community so imagine you're at a
 
02:13:34.030 --> 02:13:34.040 align:start position:0%
restaurant and you order a hamburger and
 
02:13:37.470 --> 02:13:37.480 align:start position:0%
the worker has the flu or you go to
 
02:13:42.069 --> 02:13:42.079 align:start position:0%
Dunkin' donuts and the cashier has a
 
02:13:46.310 --> 02:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
cold or your mother has is elderly and
 
02:13:48.589 --> 02:13:48.599 align:start position:0%
is recovering from surgery and is able
 
02:13:51.669 --> 02:13:51.679 align:start position:0%
to do it more affordably from home but
 
02:13:54.030 --> 02:13:54.040 align:start position:0%
their care Aid has the
 
02:13:58.390 --> 02:13:58.400 align:start position:0%
flu or you go to deas to buy groceries
 
02:14:02.790 --> 02:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
and the produce stalker has another
 
02:14:06.189 --> 02:14:06.199 align:start position:0%
colder flu something that you can catch
 
02:14:09.430 --> 02:14:09.440 align:start position:0%
all of these are true firstperson
 
02:14:12.790 --> 02:14:12.800 align:start position:0%
stories but the point I'm making
 
02:14:16.549 --> 02:14:16.559 align:start position:0%
is all of the F the largest percentage
 
02:14:20.950 --> 02:14:20.960 align:start position:0%
of folks who don't get paid sick leave
 
02:14:23.430 --> 02:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
actually handle our food work in the
 
02:14:27.270 --> 02:14:27.280 align:start position:0%
service industry our home care aids or
 
02:14:30.430 --> 02:14:30.440 align:start position:0%
work in child care centers these are
 
02:14:32.549 --> 02:14:32.559 align:start position:0%
Frontline workers that during the coid
 
02:14:36.270 --> 02:14:36.280 align:start position:0%
crisis they've received lots of
 
02:14:40.149 --> 02:14:40.159 align:start position:0%
gratitude um but if they can't afford to
 
02:14:42.790 --> 02:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
stay home when they're sick or in the
 
02:14:44.870 --> 02:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
case of the story about the Home Care
 
02:14:48.950 --> 02:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
Aid she was Point Blank told by her boss
 
02:14:51.470 --> 02:14:51.480 align:start position:0%
there is no one to replace you this
 
02:14:53.669 --> 02:14:53.679 align:start position:0%
person you need to care for would be by
 
02:14:57.069 --> 02:14:57.079 align:start position:0%
herself you have to report to your job
 
02:15:00.030 --> 02:15:00.040 align:start position:0%
or you'll be fired in each and every one
 
02:15:03.790 --> 02:15:03.800 align:start position:0%
of these cases it puts us a
 
02:15:05.589 --> 02:15:05.599 align:start position:0%
risk uh
 
02:15:09.069 --> 02:15:09.079 align:start position:0%
individually for the lack of paid sick
 
02:15:13.870 --> 02:15:13.880 align:start position:0%
leave um buy I think it's about 40% of
 
02:15:15.709 --> 02:15:15.719 align:start position:0%
the workforce in New Hampshire doesn't
 
02:15:19.149 --> 02:15:19.159 align:start position:0%
have paid sick leave and again the
 
02:15:21.870 --> 02:15:21.880 align:start position:0%
majority of those folks are people who
 
02:15:24.750 --> 02:15:24.760 align:start position:0%
are in Frontline industry jobs often
 
02:15:28.310 --> 02:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
either handling our food or in some way
 
02:15:32.790 --> 02:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
shape or form caring for others and uh
 
02:15:37.069 --> 02:15:37.079 align:start position:0%
you know so I would suggest these are
 
02:15:40.310 --> 02:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
very good reasons to want paid sickly
 
02:15:40.320 --> 02:15:41.229 align:start position:0%
very good reasons to want paid sickly
for

02:15:41.229 --> 02:15:41.239 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:15:44.189 --> 02:15:44.199 align:start position:0%
others um and I know because of your
 
02:15:44.199 --> 02:15:45.229 align:start position:0%
others um and I know because of your
technical

02:15:45.229 --> 02:15:45.239 align:start position:0%
technical
 
02:15:47.510 --> 02:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
difficulties you will appreciate that
 
02:15:51.990 --> 02:15:52.000 align:start position:0%

maram 17 in conquer I'm speaking today
 
02:16:43.509 --> 02:16:43.519 align:start position:0%
in favor of house Phill 59 FN relative

to pic
 
02:16:49.309 --> 02:16:49.319 align:start position:0%
time this time we are in has sh us how
 
02:16:52.790 --> 02:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
contagious viruses can be and the sad
 
02:16:55.830 --> 02:16:55.840 align:start position:0%
consequences of passing our illness onto
 
02:16:59.309 --> 02:16:59.319 align:start position:0%
others especially those who are elderly
 
02:17:01.589 --> 02:17:01.599 align:start position:0%
or more vulnerable than
 
02:17:05.549 --> 02:17:05.559 align:start position:0%
ourselves coid 19 provides a dramatic
 
02:17:09.549 --> 02:17:09.559 align:start position:0%
view of this bill but even in typical
 
02:17:13.870 --> 02:17:13.880 align:start position:0%
times the flu and other illnesses can be
 
02:17:16.830 --> 02:17:16.840 align:start position:0%
transmitted including by those who go to
 
02:17:19.270 --> 02:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
work sick
 
02:17:21.950 --> 02:17:21.960 align:start position:0%
those who do not have paid sick days
 
02:17:24.469 --> 02:17:24.479 align:start position:0%
often choose to go to work ill because
 
02:17:27.309 --> 02:17:27.319 align:start position:0%
they count on the money they earn to buy
 
02:17:31.270 --> 02:17:31.280 align:start position:0%
Essentials to buy groceries to pay rent
 
02:17:33.110 --> 02:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
and to support their
 
02:17:37.110 --> 02:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
families I appreciate the way that this
 
02:17:39.549 --> 02:17:39.559 align:start position:0%
bill provides fair treatment to
 
02:17:42.429 --> 02:17:42.439 align:start position:0%
part-time as well as fulltime
 
02:17:45.389 --> 02:17:45.399 align:start position:0%
employees illness does not distinguish
 
02:17:47.870 --> 02:17:47.880 align:start position:0%
between those who work 20 hours out of a
 
02:17:51.150 --> 02:17:51.160 align:start position:0%
job and those who work 40
 
02:17:54.429 --> 02:17:54.439 align:start position:0%
hours throughout my life I worked many
 
02:17:57.429 --> 02:17:57.439 align:start position:0%
part-time jobs I worked two part-time
 
02:18:00.589 --> 02:18:00.599 align:start position:0%
jobs at a time one working nearly
 
02:18:03.910 --> 02:18:03.920 align:start position:0%
full-time hours I interacted with many
 
02:18:07.669 --> 02:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
customers and clients in those
 
02:18:10.629 --> 02:18:10.639 align:start position:0%
positions and yet I didn't qualify for
 
02:18:15.309 --> 02:18:15.319 align:start position:0%
sick time being paid hourly I would not
 
02:18:19.389 --> 02:18:19.399 align:start position:0%
be paid if I did not show up to work and
 
02:18:22.509 --> 02:18:22.519 align:start position:0%
I might be looked at unfavor if I stayed
 
02:18:25.469 --> 02:18:25.479 align:start position:0%
home to get well I really missed a
 
02:18:27.509 --> 02:18:27.519 align:start position:0%
workday for those
 
02:18:29.950 --> 02:18:29.960 align:start position:0%
reasons those
 
02:18:33.270 --> 02:18:33.280 align:start position:0%
days contagious viruses are greatly on
 
02:18:37.070 --> 02:18:37.080 align:start position:0%
our minds for our good reasons however
 
02:18:39.910 --> 02:18:39.920 align:start position:0%
one time after a serious injury I went
 
02:18:42.950 --> 02:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
back to work almost immediately because
 
02:18:45.190 --> 02:18:45.200 align:start position:0%
I could not afford to stay home and I
 
02:18:48.270 --> 02:18:48.280 align:start position:0%
apologize for the background noise
 
02:18:50.589 --> 02:18:50.599 align:start position:0%
as the mother of three children I am
 
02:18:52.709 --> 02:18:52.719 align:start position:0%
pleased to see that this bill allows
 
02:18:55.830 --> 02:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
sick time to be used as a cur for family

speak in favor of Hospital 590 you know
 
02:20:59.030 --> 02:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
this same measure passed in
 
02:21:02.389 --> 02:21:02.399 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts just a few years ago uh
 
02:21:04.910 --> 02:21:04.920 align:start position:0%
and I actually worked with friends in
 
02:21:07.230 --> 02:21:07.240 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts on some of the technical
 
02:21:09.750 --> 02:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
aspects of the bill down there they've
 
02:21:12.429 --> 02:21:12.439 align:start position:0%
since done studies and they've not seen
 
02:21:15.670 --> 02:21:15.680 align:start position:0%
any negative economic effects because of
 
02:21:18.950 --> 02:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
the passage of a p sick we bill down
 
02:21:22.190 --> 02:21:22.200 align:start position:0%
there but I'd like to speak to one point
 
02:21:24.030 --> 02:21:24.040 align:start position:0%
in particular that I think is really
 
02:21:27.389 --> 02:21:27.399 align:start position:0%
important here from personal experience
 
02:21:30.910 --> 02:21:30.920 align:start position:0%
that paid sick days reduce employee
 
02:21:34.670 --> 02:21:34.680 align:start position:0%
turnover uh I I took over a job in
 
02:21:36.349 --> 02:21:36.359 align:start position:0%
Boston once as the president of the
 
02:21:39.349 --> 02:21:39.359 align:start position:0%
Greater Boston real estate they had a
 
02:21:42.309 --> 02:21:42.319 align:start position:0%
lot of problems uh one of the bigest
 
02:21:44.429 --> 02:21:44.439 align:start position:0%
problems they had was tremendous amount
 
02:21:46.990 --> 02:21:47.000 align:start position:0%
of uh employee turnover and a lot of
 
02:21:49.990 --> 02:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
their positions are highly trained
 
02:21:51.990 --> 02:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
specific ones for different duties and
 
02:21:54.550 --> 02:21:54.560 align:start position:0%
it takes you months to train someone so
 
02:21:56.910 --> 02:21:56.920 align:start position:0%
I was really interested in why was this
 
02:21:59.150 --> 02:21:59.160 align:start position:0%
level of turnover so high and a lot of
 
02:22:02.150 --> 02:22:02.160 align:start position:0%
it was the lower ranks in terms of pay
 
02:22:03.910 --> 02:22:03.920 align:start position:0%
so I took it upon myself to do my own
 
02:22:07.630 --> 02:22:07.640 align:start position:0%
research I contacted every employee over
 
02:22:10.510 --> 02:22:10.520 align:start position:0%
the from the three-year period prior to
 
02:22:13.510 --> 02:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
my taking on the job and spoke to them
 
02:22:16.750 --> 02:22:16.760 align:start position:0%
and asked why did you leave was it n
 
02:22:20.550 --> 02:22:20.560 align:start position:0%
okay was a not enough opportunity up and
 
02:22:24.309 --> 02:22:24.319 align:start position:0%
I was so surprised that about a third of
 
02:22:26.150 --> 02:22:26.160 align:start position:0%
the employees that had left in their
 
02:22:29.830 --> 02:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
previous period cited the fact that they
 
02:22:32.469 --> 02:22:32.479 align:start position:0%
didn't have paid si le and they switched
 
02:22:35.349 --> 02:22:35.359 align:start position:0%
to a job that gave them paid sick leave
 
02:22:38.150 --> 02:22:38.160 align:start position:0%
because they were dragging themselves to
 
02:22:40.190 --> 02:22:40.200 align:start position:0%
work or didn't have the opportunity in
 
02:22:42.830 --> 02:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
particular to care for their children
 
02:22:44.469 --> 02:22:44.479 align:start position:0%
when they became sick and that was the
 
02:22:47.270 --> 02:22:47.280 align:start position:0%
bigger is biggest issue so I went went
 
02:22:50.110 --> 02:22:50.120 align:start position:0%
to my board very very conservative board
 
02:22:52.150 --> 02:22:52.160 align:start position:0%
to say the least put the numbers
 
02:22:53.990 --> 02:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
together and showed that we could
 
02:22:56.469 --> 02:22:56.479 align:start position:0%
actually save money if we didn't have
 
02:22:58.990 --> 02:22:59.000 align:start position:0%
such high rates of turnover if we could
 
02:23:02.070 --> 02:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
just reduce it by that minimal amount we
 
02:23:04.910 --> 02:23:04.920 align:start position:0%
would be saving money in the long term
 
02:23:08.070 --> 02:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
more behold very next budget year we
 
02:23:10.469 --> 02:23:10.479 align:start position:0%
went in and we showed that we had less
 
02:23:12.870 --> 02:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
turnover it actually was saving us money
 
02:23:16.349 --> 02:23:16.359 align:start position:0%
in terms of training and things of that
 
02:23:17.830 --> 02:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much members of the
 
02:23:19.870 --> 02:23:19.880 align:start position:0%

02:23:22.830 --> 02:23:22.840 align:start position:0%

the Comm of the committee that you're
 
02:24:04.030 --> 02:24:04.040 align:start position:0%
giving me this chance to speak with you
 
02:24:06.110 --> 02:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
about the importance of providing sick
 
02:24:09.269 --> 02:24:09.279 align:start position:0%
leave to all employees in our state and
 
02:24:10.870 --> 02:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
I would like to share my own experience
 
02:24:12.590 --> 02:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
of having to use thck time when I
 
02:24:16.030 --> 02:24:16.040 align:start position:0%
herniated a disc in my back as I'm sure
 
02:24:19.030 --> 02:24:19.040 align:start position:0%
you all realize it happened suddenly
 
02:24:21.349 --> 02:24:21.359 align:start position:0%
without time to plan and I was
 
02:24:23.630 --> 02:24:23.640 align:start position:0%
immediately in such excruciating pain
 
02:24:26.150 --> 02:24:26.160 align:start position:0%
that I was sick to my stomach I was at a
 
02:24:28.269 --> 02:24:28.279 align:start position:0%
restaurant having dinner with friends
 
02:24:31.070 --> 02:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
and I had to leave immediately although
 
02:24:33.110 --> 02:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
I wasn't sure that I would be able to
 
02:24:35.230 --> 02:24:35.240 align:start position:0%
manage driving the short distance to my
 
02:24:38.510 --> 02:24:38.520 align:start position:0%
house I couldn't stand or sit
 
02:24:41.750 --> 02:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
comfortably and the pain was so intense
 
02:24:43.710 --> 02:24:43.720 align:start position:0%
I honestly couldn't think about anything
 
02:24:46.710 --> 02:24:46.720 align:start position:0%
other than the pain fortunately at the
 
02:24:46.720 --> 02:24:47.630 align:start position:0%
other than the pain fortunately at the
time

02:24:47.630 --> 02:24:47.640 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:24:50.510 --> 02:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
I'm now retired I was a public school
 
02:24:53.710 --> 02:24:53.720 align:start position:0%
teacher and I had sick time negotiated
 
02:24:57.309 --> 02:24:57.319 align:start position:0%
in my contract and I needed it I needed
 
02:24:59.950 --> 02:24:59.960 align:start position:0%
it both for the following couple of days
 
02:25:02.590 --> 02:25:02.600 align:start position:0%
until the intensity of the pain subsided
 
02:25:04.950 --> 02:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
and I needed it for my recovery after
 
02:25:08.309 --> 02:25:08.319 align:start position:0%
surgery and I was always profoundly
 
02:25:11.070 --> 02:25:11.080 align:start position:0%
aware of my privilege in being able to
 
02:25:13.870 --> 02:25:13.880 align:start position:0%
take time off I speak to you this
 
02:25:16.030 --> 02:25:16.040 align:start position:0%
morning about all those who don't have
 
02:25:18.630 --> 02:25:18.640 align:start position:0%
sick time who cannot be at home with an
 
02:25:21.990 --> 02:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
ill child or care for an ill parent or
 
02:25:24.630 --> 02:25:24.640 align:start position:0%
recover from surgery or illness without
 
02:25:28.510 --> 02:25:28.520 align:start position:0%
losing P I know every single one of us
 
02:25:30.710 --> 02:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
has had that experience of sudden
 
02:25:32.910 --> 02:25:32.920 align:start position:0%
illness that prompts us to spend some
 
02:25:34.670 --> 02:25:34.680 align:start position:0%
time on the floor of a
 
02:25:37.429 --> 02:25:37.439 align:start position:0%
bathroom and I want you to consider as
 
02:25:39.590 --> 02:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
was earlier mentioned those individuals
 
02:25:41.389 --> 02:25:41.399 align:start position:0%
who still must somehow show up for their
 
02:25:44.309 --> 02:25:44.319 align:start position:0%
work I know I'm not alone in finding it
 
02:25:46.630 --> 02:25:46.640 align:start position:0%
horrifying to consider that someone with
 
02:25:49.150 --> 02:25:49.160 align:start position:0%
the flu might be preparing or serving a
 
02:25:53.070 --> 02:25:53.080 align:start position:0%
meal I plan to eat I know I'm not alone
 
02:25:55.590 --> 02:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
in wanting the people who work in retail
 
02:25:57.590 --> 02:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
or at the grocery store or in
 
02:26:00.190 --> 02:26:00.200 align:start position:0%
restaurants or in any number of small
 
02:26:02.710 --> 02:26:02.720 align:start position:0%
businesses to know that they can and
 
02:26:06.309 --> 02:26:06.319 align:start position:0%
should stay home when they're contagious
 
02:26:09.429 --> 02:26:09.439 align:start position:0%
I think also of those caring for
 
02:26:13.110 --> 02:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
children or a spouse or parents who've
 
02:26:15.590 --> 02:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
been hospitalized who are dying who are
 
02:26:17.910 --> 02:26:17.920 align:start position:0%
in need of care and the struggles of
 
02:26:19.630 --> 02:26:19.640 align:start position:0%
these individuals have been made
 
02:26:23.309 --> 02:26:23.319 align:start position:0%
profoundly clear during the pandemic War
 
02:26:25.710 --> 02:26:25.720 align:start position:0%
experience those of us with good
 
02:26:28.790 --> 02:26:28.800 align:start position:0%
benefits those of us with negotiated
 
02:26:31.990 --> 02:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
contracts those of us who are privileged

president of graphic has which is a
 
02:27:44.590 --> 02:27:44.600 align:start position:0%
Manufacturing Company in Jaffrey New
 
02:27:47.030 --> 02:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh for the record I am also
 
02:27:50.269 --> 02:27:50.279 align:start position:0%
the past chair of the Bia but I am not
 
02:27:53.710 --> 02:27:53.720 align:start position:0%
speaking on behalf of the Bia today as
 
02:27:56.110 --> 02:27:56.120 align:start position:0%
president of a company twice named as a
 
02:27:57.990 --> 02:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
top 10 company to work for in New
 
02:28:00.269 --> 02:28:00.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and one which currently
 
02:28:02.710 --> 02:28:02.720 align:start position:0%
provides paid time off to our employees
 
02:28:05.150 --> 02:28:05.160 align:start position:0%
I am not at all opposed to the concept
 
02:28:07.990 --> 02:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
of paytime offer paid sick time I think
 
02:28:10.150 --> 02:28:10.160 align:start position:0%
company policies and benefits should be
 
02:28:12.830 --> 02:28:12.840 align:start position:0%
constructed to remove or reduce family
 
02:28:15.429 --> 02:28:15.439 align:start position:0%
stress so that employees can focus on
 
02:28:18.230 --> 02:28:18.240 align:start position:0%
the work for which they are paid these
 
02:28:20.429 --> 02:28:20.439 align:start position:0%
benefits provide financial and emotional
 
02:28:22.630 --> 02:28:22.640 align:start position:0%
support to our employees they also
 
02:28:24.309 --> 02:28:24.319 align:start position:0%
improve the productivity and
 
02:28:26.550 --> 02:28:26.560 align:start position:0%
profitability of our company paid
 
02:28:28.469 --> 02:28:28.479 align:start position:0%
benefits I think make good economic
 
02:28:31.309 --> 02:28:31.319 align:start position:0%
sense to the individual to the company
 
02:28:32.550 --> 02:28:32.560 align:start position:0%
and to our
 
02:28:35.830 --> 02:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
society however I oppose this bill as
 
02:28:37.790 --> 02:28:37.800 align:start position:0%
written because I feel there's an
 
02:28:40.630 --> 02:28:40.640 align:start position:0%
overbearing prescriptive nature uh
 
02:28:42.870 --> 02:28:42.880 align:start position:0%
included in this bill on how paid sick
 
02:28:45.269 --> 02:28:45.279 align:start position:0%
leave or paid sick time off is to be
 
02:28:47.870 --> 02:28:47.880 align:start position:0%
allocated and managed each company has
 
02:28:50.230 --> 02:28:50.240 align:start position:0%
its own history and culture these
 
02:28:52.190 --> 02:28:52.200 align:start position:0%
provide the basis for company policies
 
02:28:54.150 --> 02:28:54.160 align:start position:0%
and philosophies that make a particular
 
02:28:57.110 --> 02:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
company an attractive place to work the
 
02:28:59.550 --> 02:28:59.560 align:start position:0%
company's Financial conditions also
 
02:29:02.309 --> 02:29:02.319 align:start position:0%
impact its ability to provide benefits
 
02:29:04.070 --> 02:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
the combination of all these factors
 
02:29:06.070 --> 02:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
allows companies to craft benefit
 
02:29:08.269 --> 02:29:08.279 align:start position:0%
packages that balance employee needs
 
02:29:09.429 --> 02:29:09.439 align:start position:0%
with company
 
02:29:12.230 --> 02:29:12.240 align:start position:0%
resources this bill intends to create a
 
02:29:14.030 --> 02:29:14.040 align:start position:0%
highly prescriptive set of rules that
 
02:29:15.710 --> 02:29:15.720 align:start position:0%
strip companies of their ability to
 
02:29:18.110 --> 02:29:18.120 align:start position:0%
create policy that make sense for them
 
02:29:20.590 --> 02:29:20.600 align:start position:0%
and their employees these prescriptions
 
02:29:22.349 --> 02:29:22.359 align:start position:0%
do not take into account company
 
02:29:25.309 --> 02:29:25.319 align:start position:0%
finances employee demographics company
 
02:29:28.429 --> 02:29:28.439 align:start position:0%
attendance policies local cultural norms
 
02:29:31.469 --> 02:29:31.479 align:start position:0%
owner philosophies company operations
 
02:29:32.830 --> 02:29:32.840 align:start position:0%
and everything else that goes into
 
02:29:35.750 --> 02:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
developing workable policies I also feel
 
02:29:36.990 --> 02:29:37.000 align:start position:0%
they don't take into account human
 
02:29:39.309 --> 02:29:39.319 align:start position:0%
nature as anyone who owns or runs a
 
02:29:40.510 --> 02:29:40.520 align:start position:0%
business will
 
02:29:42.910 --> 02:29:42.920 align:start position:0%
confirm legislating that companies
 
02:29:44.670 --> 02:29:44.680 align:start position:0%
should have paid sick leave May gain
 
02:29:46.230 --> 02:29:46.240 align:start position:0%
some support in the business Community
 
02:29:49.070 --> 02:29:49.080 align:start position:0%
as this is a policy already in place
 
02:29:51.670 --> 02:29:51.680 align:start position:0%
with many employers however dictating
 
02:29:53.990 --> 02:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
how to implement and how to manage paid
 
02:29:55.590 --> 02:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
sick leave will gain no support from the
 
02:29:59.510 --> 02:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:01.870 --> 02:30:01.880 align:start position:0%
much thank you for your comments any
 
02:30:04.950 --> 02:30:04.960 align:start position:0%
questions for the speaker representative
 
02:30:07.670 --> 02:30:07.680 align:start position:0%
kahill you're recognized for a question
 
02:30:09.910 --> 02:30:09.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and uh thank you
 
02:30:12.389 --> 02:30:12.399 align:start position:0%
Mr vanchu for taking my question I I
 
02:30:14.269 --> 02:30:14.279 align:start position:0%
understand from you know I I read your
 
02:30:16.230 --> 02:30:16.240 align:start position:0%
uh letter and I heard your testimony I
 
02:30:18.950 --> 02:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
understand that you uh you agreed with
 
02:30:21.269 --> 02:30:21.279 align:start position:0%
the previous speaker that this is a good
 
02:30:24.309 --> 02:30:24.319 align:start position:0%
policy to have uh offering paid sick
 
02:30:26.150 --> 02:30:26.160 align:start position:0%
time it makes economic sense it's good
 
02:30:27.070 --> 02:30:27.080 align:start position:0%
for your
 
02:30:29.510 --> 02:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
retention um and and yet there we
 
02:30:32.389 --> 02:30:32.399 align:start position:0%
learned that there are 30 some 30% of uh
 
02:30:35.110 --> 02:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
employees that don't have it and how are
 
02:30:38.670 --> 02:30:38.680 align:start position:0%
we to how are we to uh remedy this if we
 
02:30:41.750 --> 02:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
don't as you say prescribe uh rules
 
02:30:44.230 --> 02:30:44.240 align:start position:0%
minimum rules at that but do something
 
02:30:46.670 --> 02:30:46.680 align:start position:0%
so that they will have some opportunity
 
02:30:48.710 --> 02:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
to address these situations as they
 
02:30:51.110 --> 02:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
arise well you know in reading through
 
02:30:52.750 --> 02:30:52.760 align:start position:0%
the the the bill I mean the the
 
02:30:56.389 --> 02:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
prescriptions are so specific as to make
 
02:30:58.429 --> 02:30:58.439 align:start position:0%
every company have almost exactly the
 
02:31:01.429 --> 02:31:01.439 align:start position:0%
same rules and when you've got tens of
 
02:31:03.230 --> 02:31:03.240 align:start position:0%
thousands of individual Employers in the
 
02:31:04.510 --> 02:31:04.520 align:start position:0%
state each with their own set of
 
02:31:06.070 --> 02:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
circumstances and
 
02:31:08.389 --> 02:31:08.399 align:start position:0%
workforces uh you just can't have a
 
02:31:11.190 --> 02:31:11.200 align:start position:0%
blanket policy that fits all the
 
02:31:12.550 --> 02:31:12.560 align:start position:0%
circumstances that each of those
 
02:31:14.910 --> 02:31:14.920 align:start position:0%
companies have whether it's U you know
 
02:31:17.630 --> 02:31:17.640 align:start position:0%
the the uh they their financial
 
02:31:20.349 --> 02:31:20.359 align:start position:0%
resources for example or uh whether or
 
02:31:22.309 --> 02:31:22.319 align:start position:0%
not as like in our case we operate
 
02:31:24.630 --> 02:31:24.640 align:start position:0%
multiple shifts uh we have a mix of
 
02:31:26.349 --> 02:31:26.359 align:start position:0%
different types of people on the floor I
 
02:31:28.190 --> 02:31:28.200 align:start position:0%
mean all these things are things that we
 
02:31:31.230 --> 02:31:31.240 align:start position:0%
we spend a lot of time uh taking into
 
02:31:33.630 --> 02:31:33.640 align:start position:0%
consideration when we develop our our
 
02:31:36.230 --> 02:31:36.240 align:start position:0%
benefits packages and they're they're
 
02:31:40.429 --> 02:31:40.439 align:start position:0%
specific to our needs and specific to um
 
02:31:42.150 --> 02:31:42.160 align:start position:0%
you know what we can afford to do and
 
02:31:44.349 --> 02:31:44.359 align:start position:0%
how what makes sense for us and our
 
02:31:46.950 --> 02:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
employees to get the best benefit for
 
02:31:49.510 --> 02:31:49.520 align:start position:0%
everyone having a whole list of what we
 
02:31:51.510 --> 02:31:51.520 align:start position:0%
have to do without taking any of that
 
02:31:54.230 --> 02:31:54.240 align:start position:0%
into consideration just creates a
 
02:31:56.309 --> 02:31:56.319 align:start position:0%
disastrous situation for many many
 
02:31:58.630 --> 02:31:58.640 align:start position:0%
companies I think if you say you know
 
02:32:00.830 --> 02:32:00.840 align:start position:0%
our our our feeling is that there should
 
02:32:04.269 --> 02:32:04.279 align:start position:0%
be paid uh sick leave and it should be
 
02:32:09.429 --> 02:32:09.439 align:start position:0%
you know u x percent of you know of um
 
02:32:11.070 --> 02:32:11.080 align:start position:0%
you know X number of days per year or
 
02:32:13.070 --> 02:32:13.080 align:start position:0%
something and then leave it at that
 
02:32:15.429 --> 02:32:15.439 align:start position:0%
don't tell us how to put that together
 
02:32:18.550 --> 02:32:18.560 align:start position:0%
because you can't know what is involved
 
02:32:20.590 --> 02:32:20.600 align:start position:0%
in running my company to be able to tell
 
02:32:22.910 --> 02:32:22.920 align:start position:0%
me from you know the other side of the
 
02:32:24.990 --> 02:32:25.000 align:start position:0%
state that this is how I should run my
 
02:32:27.230 --> 02:32:27.240 align:start position:0%
company I have a better sense of my
 
02:32:29.070 --> 02:32:29.080 align:start position:0%
employees and their needs and their
 
02:32:32.590 --> 02:32:32.600 align:start position:0%
capabilities and I've already decided
 
02:32:34.950 --> 02:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
you know decades ago that this is this
 
02:32:36.790 --> 02:32:36.800 align:start position:0%
is something that's of benefit to us and
 
02:32:40.309 --> 02:32:40.319 align:start position:0%
we've evolved that policy over years as
 
02:32:42.070 --> 02:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
our Workforce has changed as
 
02:32:44.710 --> 02:32:44.720 align:start position:0%
circumstances have changed uh you know
 
02:32:47.150 --> 02:32:47.160 align:start position:0%
this this legislation would would would
 
02:32:50.190 --> 02:32:50.200 align:start position:0%
restrict us uh with with many directives
 
02:32:52.750 --> 02:32:52.760 align:start position:0%
about how many days should be allocated
 
02:32:54.830 --> 02:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
how they recruit how they should I I
 
02:32:56.550 --> 02:32:56.560 align:start position:0%
don't think that's the the role of you
 
02:32:58.389 --> 02:32:58.399 align:start position:0%
know the legislature or government to
 
02:33:00.630 --> 02:33:00.640 align:start position:0%
tell us specifically you know especially
 
02:33:02.469 --> 02:33:02.479 align:start position:0%
a private company exactly how to run
 
02:33:03.950 --> 02:33:03.960 align:start position:0%
every aspect of its
 
02:33:07.429 --> 02:33:07.439 align:start position:0%
business saying that as a society having
 
02:33:08.950 --> 02:33:08.960 align:start position:0%
paid six leave is something that's a
 
02:33:11.429 --> 02:33:11.439 align:start position:0%
benefit to society is one thing and I
 
02:33:13.269 --> 02:33:13.279 align:start position:0%
agree with that what I don't agree with
 
02:33:14.950 --> 02:33:14.960 align:start position:0%
is you telling me how to run my program
 
02:33:18.070 --> 02:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
for my business without knowing the
 
02:33:19.230 --> 02:33:19.240 align:start position:0%
things that I know and the things that
 
02:33:21.710 --> 02:33:21.720 align:start position:0%
we have to deal with to make that policy
 
02:33:24.950 --> 02:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
effective follow up Mr chairman follow
 
02:33:28.750 --> 02:33:28.760 align:start position:0%
up thank you sir uh you in the bill
 
02:33:31.550 --> 02:33:31.560 align:start position:0%
there's language that if if your company
 
02:33:34.110 --> 02:33:34.120 align:start position:0%
meets or exceeds you know what we what
 
02:33:36.630 --> 02:33:36.640 align:start position:0%
the minimum we require you're all set
 
02:33:37.870 --> 02:33:37.880 align:start position:0%
it's not going to be that you have to
 
02:33:39.630 --> 02:33:39.640 align:start position:0%
match it it's just that you know you
 
02:33:42.469 --> 02:33:42.479 align:start position:0%
have to be that that as a minimum well
 
02:33:45.790 --> 02:33:45.800 align:start position:0%
you're you're suggesting a certain uh uh
 
02:33:49.830 --> 02:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
AC croval rate um which I think is again
 
02:33:51.910 --> 02:33:51.920 align:start position:0%
uh something that is is something that
 
02:33:54.950 --> 02:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
we should be able to determine based on
 
02:33:57.389 --> 02:33:57.399 align:start position:0%
how our company operates uh you're you
 
02:33:58.710 --> 02:33:58.720 align:start position:0%
know I think the suggestion is something
 
02:34:01.269 --> 02:34:01.279 align:start position:0%
like 12 days a year uh you know we got
 
02:34:03.990 --> 02:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
away from paid sick days and went to pay
 
02:34:06.070 --> 02:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
time off to give our employees more
 
02:34:08.950 --> 02:34:08.960 align:start position:0%
flexibility and how to choose the time
 
02:34:10.990 --> 02:34:11.000 align:start position:0%
so and we also have shortterm disability
 
02:34:13.030 --> 02:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
in place so within five days that
 
02:34:14.670 --> 02:34:14.680 align:start position:0%
short-term disability kicks in so
 
02:34:16.469 --> 02:34:16.479 align:start position:0%
they're not using their sick time and
 
02:34:18.190 --> 02:34:18.200 align:start position:0%
they have another mechanism to support
 
02:34:19.710 --> 02:34:19.720 align:start position:0%
themselves you know these are all things
 
02:34:22.230 --> 02:34:22.240 align:start position:0%
that we evolve over time and again I
 
02:34:24.469 --> 02:34:24.479 align:start position:0%
don't think there's there's anything
 
02:34:26.990 --> 02:34:27.000 align:start position:0%
wrong with the concept of of paid uh
 
02:34:30.269 --> 02:34:30.279 align:start position:0%
sick leave or paid time off I just don't
 
02:34:32.710 --> 02:34:32.720 align:start position:0%
appreciate someone who has no knowledge
 
02:34:35.309 --> 02:34:35.319 align:start position:0%
of what we do or whatever thousands of
 
02:34:37.469 --> 02:34:37.479 align:start position:0%
other companies do telling us exactly
 
02:34:39.349 --> 02:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
how that policy should be you don't tell
 
02:34:41.150 --> 02:34:41.160 align:start position:0%
us what our wages should be you don't
 
02:34:43.150 --> 02:34:43.160 align:start position:0%
tell us you know what our vacation
 
02:34:45.429 --> 02:34:45.439 align:start position:0%
policies should be um you know we're
 
02:34:47.230 --> 02:34:47.240 align:start position:0%
private companies we can determine what
 
02:34:50.269 --> 02:34:50.279 align:start position:0%
we want to do uh we're not violating any
 
02:34:52.510 --> 02:34:52.520 align:start position:0%
law we're free to choose that if the
 
02:34:53.950 --> 02:34:53.960 align:start position:0%
employees don't like what we're offering
 
02:34:55.389 --> 02:34:55.399 align:start position:0%
they don't have to work here if they do
 
02:34:56.429 --> 02:34:56.439 align:start position:0%
like what we're offering they're going
 
02:34:59.230 --> 02:34:59.240 align:start position:0%
to come in in in in droves uh I mean
 
02:35:01.070 --> 02:35:01.080 align:start position:0%
that's the nature of the of the free
 
02:35:03.269 --> 02:35:03.279 align:start position:0%
free market uh not only for businesses
 
02:35:05.550 --> 02:35:05.560 align:start position:0%
but for Labor uh so I don't I don't
 
02:35:09.389 --> 02:35:09.399 align:start position:0%
think you know prescribing very specific
 
02:35:12.630 --> 02:35:12.640 align:start position:0%
uh benefits is is really the direction
 
02:35:15.110 --> 02:35:15.120 align:start position:0%
we should be going saying as a society
 
02:35:16.670 --> 02:35:16.680 align:start position:0%
we should have certain benefits because
 
02:35:18.870 --> 02:35:18.880 align:start position:0%
they benefit Society is one thing but
 
02:35:21.150 --> 02:35:21.160 align:start position:0%
then leave it leave it to everyone to to
 
02:35:22.550 --> 02:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
work out the way that makes the most
 
02:35:23.790 --> 02:35:23.800 align:start position:0%
sense for
 
02:35:25.870 --> 02:35:25.880 align:start position:0%
them thank you I appreciate your
 
02:35:30.110 --> 02:35:30.120 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you
 
02:35:32.590 --> 02:35:32.600 align:start position:0%
repres representative
 
02:35:35.630 --> 02:35:35.640 align:start position:0%
Adon thank you Mr chairman um can
 
02:35:38.349 --> 02:35:38.359 align:start position:0%
everybody hear me
 
02:35:42.030 --> 02:35:42.040 align:start position:0%
y um I wanted to follow up on uh
 
02:35:45.190 --> 02:35:45.200 align:start position:0%
something you said in your first answer
 
02:35:46.750 --> 02:35:46.760 align:start position:0%
um you made a com comment something
 
02:35:49.590 --> 02:35:49.600 align:start position:0%
similar to uh if you want to tell us how
 
02:35:53.590 --> 02:35:53.600 align:start position:0%
many days uh we're required to provide
 
02:35:56.110 --> 02:35:56.120 align:start position:0%
uh paid sick leave for uh then that's a
 
02:35:57.510 --> 02:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
different thing but don't tell us
 
02:36:00.030 --> 02:36:00.040 align:start position:0%
specifically how to do that um what do
 
02:36:03.870 --> 02:36:03.880 align:start position:0%
you think is a reasonable number of days
 
02:36:06.630 --> 02:36:06.640 align:start position:0%
that the state should uh ensure the
 
02:36:08.590 --> 02:36:08.600 align:start position:0%
employees have access to paid
 
02:36:12.110 --> 02:36:12.120 align:start position:0%
leave well when we had specific paid
 
02:36:15.269 --> 02:36:15.279 align:start position:0%
sick leave um and I think it was fairly
 
02:36:15.279 --> 02:36:16.630 align:start position:0%
sick leave um and I think it was fairly
common

02:36:16.630 --> 02:36:16.640 align:start position:0%
common
 
02:36:18.590 --> 02:36:18.600 align:start position:0%
in the in the area we had three three
 
02:36:21.349 --> 02:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
days per year and it it accured um you
 
02:36:23.590 --> 02:36:23.600 align:start position:0%
know a certain number of hours uh you
 
02:36:26.950 --> 02:36:26.960 align:start position:0%
know per per hour work or per per week
 
02:36:28.750 --> 02:36:28.760 align:start position:0%
um but what we found was that we were
 
02:36:31.070 --> 02:36:31.080 align:start position:0%
really operating with two systems a a
 
02:36:34.110 --> 02:36:34.120 align:start position:0%
sick leave system and a vacation system
 
02:36:35.990 --> 02:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
and sometimes those things would be in
 
02:36:39.990 --> 02:36:40.000 align:start position:0%
in conflict with each other so um in in
 
02:36:41.269 --> 02:36:41.279 align:start position:0%
consultation with a number of other
 
02:36:44.030 --> 02:36:44.040 align:start position:0%
companies as to where they were evolving
 
02:36:47.269 --> 02:36:47.279 align:start position:0%
um they went to a a paid time off where
 
02:36:48.750 --> 02:36:48.760 align:start position:0%
there's a pool of days that are
 
02:36:51.070 --> 02:36:51.080 align:start position:0%
available to be used as the employee
 
02:36:54.190 --> 02:36:54.200 align:start position:0%
wishes so what we did is we took our our
 
02:36:57.389 --> 02:36:57.399 align:start position:0%
our typical uh vacation acral system
 
02:36:59.550 --> 02:36:59.560 align:start position:0%
which is based on years of service and
 
02:37:02.590 --> 02:37:02.600 align:start position:0%
we added our our three days of uh of
 
02:37:05.510 --> 02:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
sick leave to that pool and we added um
 
02:37:08.469 --> 02:37:08.479 align:start position:0%
an extra day that people got and made
 
02:37:11.030 --> 02:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
the whole pool available which gives the
 
02:37:15.070 --> 02:37:15.080 align:start position:0%
employee a great deal of um control over
 
02:37:16.990 --> 02:37:17.000 align:start position:0%
how and when they use those days so
 
02:37:20.110 --> 02:37:20.120 align:start position:0%
there there is right now no level of of
 
02:37:22.150 --> 02:37:22.160 align:start position:0%
sick days there's there's a level of of
 
02:37:25.750 --> 02:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
PTO so um depending on the the
 
02:37:27.710 --> 02:37:27.720 align:start position:0%
circumstances uh you know an employee
 
02:37:30.590 --> 02:37:30.600 align:start position:0%
could take five days of of PTO for an
 
02:37:33.830 --> 02:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
illness uh or you know two or three days
 
02:37:35.630 --> 02:37:35.640 align:start position:0%
uh it gives them the opportunity to
 
02:37:38.830 --> 02:37:38.840 align:start position:0%
manage that and it also uh eliminates
 
02:37:40.950 --> 02:37:40.960 align:start position:0%
the the the situation where you have
 
02:37:43.870 --> 02:37:43.880 align:start position:0%
people needing a sick day uh but not
 
02:37:46.230 --> 02:37:46.240 align:start position:0%
having any of the the sick days left and
 
02:37:48.269 --> 02:37:48.279 align:start position:0%
then calling in sick and taking it as an
 
02:37:50.910 --> 02:37:50.920 align:start position:0%
unpaid day when in the PTO system they
 
02:37:52.990 --> 02:37:53.000 align:start position:0%
could just use it as PTO so we felt this
 
02:37:56.110 --> 02:37:56.120 align:start position:0%
was a a better system for the employees
 
02:37:58.790 --> 02:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
to be able to manage their time and in
 
02:38:01.150 --> 02:38:01.160 align:start position:0%
in all cases uh you if an employee knows
 
02:38:03.110 --> 02:38:03.120 align:start position:0%
they're going to be out for you know
 
02:38:05.030 --> 02:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
going to the hospital with a with a sick
 
02:38:06.510 --> 02:38:06.520 align:start position:0%
child or something like that as long as
 
02:38:08.950 --> 02:38:08.960 align:start position:0%
they give us uh you know notice ahead of
 
02:38:11.070 --> 02:38:11.080 align:start position:0%
time then they can take their their PTO
 
02:38:12.910 --> 02:38:12.920 align:start position:0%
and it's it's already planned and and
 
02:38:15.070 --> 02:38:15.080 align:start position:0%
buil into the schedule and and nobody
 
02:38:18.510 --> 02:38:18.520 align:start position:0%
suffers so I think PTO is a better
 
02:38:20.590 --> 02:38:20.600 align:start position:0%
system but when we were on paid sick
 
02:38:23.150 --> 02:38:23.160 align:start position:0%
leave we uh we went with three days and
 
02:38:25.190 --> 02:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
and that seemed to be the norm uh in
 
02:38:25.200 --> 02:38:26.510 align:start position:0%
and that seemed to be the norm uh in
this

02:38:26.510 --> 02:38:26.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:38:30.269 --> 02:38:30.279 align:start position:0%
area you have a followup question yes
 
02:38:33.030 --> 02:38:33.040 align:start position:0%
Uhn if you if you'd uh take a followup
 
02:38:36.269 --> 02:38:36.279 align:start position:0%
I'd appreciate it um so I just so I did
 
02:38:38.910 --> 02:38:38.920 align:start position:0%
the math um and anybody's free to
 
02:38:40.750 --> 02:38:40.760 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong because I'm open
 
02:38:44.710 --> 02:38:44.720 align:start position:0%
to being wrong um looks like the maximum
 
02:38:46.710 --> 02:38:46.720 align:start position:0%
of number of days
 
02:38:49.710 --> 02:38:49.720 align:start position:0%
a year that this would be applicable to
 
02:38:54.750 --> 02:38:54.760 align:start position:0%
is 8 and a half um out of 365 days a
 
02:38:56.870 --> 02:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
year uh do you think that's an
 
02:38:56.880 --> 02:38:58.550 align:start position:0%
year uh do you think that's an
unreasonable

02:38:58.550 --> 02:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
unreasonable
 
02:39:01.469 --> 02:39:01.479 align:start position:0%
standard um based on what I read and
 
02:39:05.349 --> 02:39:05.359 align:start position:0%
using 2080 hours as a normal work year I
 
02:39:07.030 --> 02:39:07.040 align:start position:0%
think I ran a calculation and it was
 
02:39:09.030 --> 02:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
more like 12 days perhaps maybe I was
 
02:39:12.910 --> 02:39:12.920 align:start position:0%
wrong on that I um but uh you know eight
 
02:39:12.920 --> 02:39:14.630 align:start position:0%
wrong on that I um but uh you know eight
days

02:39:14.630 --> 02:39:14.640 align:start position:0%
days
 
02:39:18.429 --> 02:39:18.439 align:start position:0%
um you know it's I I I can't say I mean
 
02:39:20.150 --> 02:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
depends on the on the business that's
 
02:39:23.269 --> 02:39:23.279 align:start position:0%
why you know it's hard to uh to dictate
 
02:39:25.590 --> 02:39:25.600 align:start position:0%
what what's what's the norm uh some
 
02:39:27.429 --> 02:39:27.439 align:start position:0%
businesses eight days may be fine other
 
02:39:30.070 --> 02:39:30.080 align:start position:0%
businesses you know a richer number
 
02:39:32.550 --> 02:39:32.560 align:start position:0%
could be fine it it really depends on on
 
02:39:34.870 --> 02:39:34.880 align:start position:0%
the circumstances of the business um you
 
02:39:37.950 --> 02:39:37.960 align:start position:0%
know in our case um you know we like as
 
02:39:40.349 --> 02:39:40.359 align:start position:0%
I said we uh we were operating on the
 
02:39:45.070 --> 02:39:45.080 align:start position:0%
three-day six day uh plan for for maybe
 
02:39:48.070 --> 02:39:48.080 align:start position:0%
15 years and um just through our
 
02:39:50.670 --> 02:39:50.680 align:start position:0%
experience we we recognize that PTO was
 
02:39:54.389 --> 02:39:54.399 align:start position:0%
better if you take PTO um you know and
 
02:39:57.070 --> 02:39:57.080 align:start position:0%
it encompasses everything it gives the
 
02:39:58.910 --> 02:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
the employee plenty of opportunity in
 
02:40:02.190 --> 02:40:02.200 align:start position:0%
which case even for a new employee uh
 
02:40:05.389 --> 02:40:05.399 align:start position:0%
the PTO is is considerably greater than
 
02:40:06.910 --> 02:40:06.920 align:start position:0%
than the than the eight days because it
 
02:40:12.750 --> 02:40:12.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:15.790 --> 02:40:15.800 align:start position:0%
vacation all right thank you for your

02:41:07.830 --> 02:41:07.840 align:start position:0%
um and I'm 22 years old and so I'm very
 
02:41:10.670 --> 02:41:10.680 align:start position:0%
in tune with how my body is doing
 
02:41:13.309 --> 02:41:13.319 align:start position:0%
and but days when I cannot work still
 
02:41:14.910 --> 02:41:14.920 align:start position:0%
occur much more frequently than I would
 
02:41:17.750 --> 02:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
like and I no control over that right
 
02:41:19.710 --> 02:41:19.720 align:start position:0%
now I'm a full-time student but I also
 
02:41:22.510 --> 02:41:22.520 align:start position:0%
work in retail part-time um I'm lucky
 
02:41:24.469 --> 02:41:24.479 align:start position:0%
that my managers are very accommodating
 
02:41:26.110 --> 02:41:26.120 align:start position:0%
and do not require me to come into work
 
02:41:27.750 --> 02:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
when I am sick but I still have to miss
 
02:41:38.389 --> 02:41:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:44.429 --> 02:41:44.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:44.439 --> 02:41:48.670 align:start position:0%

02:42:02.630 --> 02:42:02.640 align:start position:0%
it again and and then if we can't um I'm
 
02:42:05.469 --> 02:42:05.479 align:start position:0%
just going to have to um ask you to send
 
02:42:07.630 --> 02:42:07.640 align:start position:0%
in written testimony but go ahead again
 
02:42:09.150 --> 02:42:09.160 align:start position:0%

did hear that you're a full-time you're
 
02:42:19.790 --> 02:42:19.800 align:start position:0%
we did hear up to the point where your
 
02:42:25.389 --> 02:42:25.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:28.510 --> 02:42:28.520 align:start position:0%
time so um I work in retail parttime and
 
02:42:30.389 --> 02:42:30.399 align:start position:0%
I'm lucky my managers are accommodating
 
02:42:31.950 --> 02:42:31.960 align:start position:0%
and do not require me to come in when I
 
02:42:33.990 --> 02:42:34.000 align:start position:0%
am sick but this still means I have to
 
02:42:37.030 --> 02:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
miss the days worth of pay um I'm also
 
02:42:38.469 --> 02:42:38.479 align:start position:0%
lucky that I
 
02:42:41.429 --> 02:42:41.439 align:start position:0%
current with my par of missing a
 
02:42:43.269 --> 02:42:43.279 align:start position:0%

02:42:48.230 --> 02:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
going to mean for me as a chronically
 
02:42:48.240 --> 02:42:51.309 align:start position:0%
going to mean for me as a chronically
ill

02:42:51.309 --> 02:42:51.319 align:start position:0%

person

02:42:56.389 --> 02:42:56.399 align:start position:0%

record my name's Gary Abbot I'm the

Executive Vice President of the

associated general contractors of New
 
02:43:54.910 --> 02:43:54.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh I'm before you today as I
 
02:43:57.469 --> 02:43:57.479 align:start position:0%
have been in previous sessions uh
 
02:44:00.389 --> 02:44:00.399 align:start position:0%
opposed to this legislation I can tell
 
02:44:02.269 --> 02:44:02.279 align:start position:0%
you that we brought it up before our
 
02:44:04.590 --> 02:44:04.600 align:start position:0%
board of directors and our legislative
 
02:44:07.550 --> 02:44:07.560 align:start position:0%
committees and our HR committees and
 
02:44:11.830 --> 02:44:11.840 align:start position:0%
they all want to retain the company uh
 
02:44:14.110 --> 02:44:14.120 align:start position:0%
putting together their own vacation and
 
02:44:16.550 --> 02:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
sick time uh
 
02:44:18.950 --> 02:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
policies this bill heads us in a
 
02:44:20.830 --> 02:44:20.840 align:start position:0%
direction of a
 
02:44:24.550 --> 02:44:24.560 align:start position:0%
prescriptive State policy for all
 
02:44:27.349 --> 02:44:27.359 align:start position:0%
businesses uh whether full full or
 
02:44:30.349 --> 02:44:30.359 align:start position:0%
part-time we recognize that we're in
 
02:44:33.550 --> 02:44:33.560 align:start position:0%
support of sick Le uh but we like to
 
02:44:36.510 --> 02:44:36.520 align:start position:0%
leave it up to our individual companies
 
02:44:39.510 --> 02:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
to decide what type of policy and how
 
02:44:42.710 --> 02:44:42.720 align:start position:0%
much time to be given uh be all part of
 
02:44:45.790 --> 02:44:45.800 align:start position:0%
those policies uh this seems to put in a
 
02:44:48.550 --> 02:44:48.560 align:start position:0%
lot of things that uh some companies
 
02:44:50.870 --> 02:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
have some companies don't some companies
 
02:44:55.750 --> 02:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
go beyond this so um it also would raise
 
02:44:58.070 --> 02:44:58.080 align:start position:0%
some issues with smaller firms that
 
02:45:00.630 --> 02:45:00.640 align:start position:0%
don't do on AC cruel basis this would
 
02:45:04.790 --> 02:45:04.800 align:start position:0%
mandate in a cruel uh basis of uh
 
02:45:07.670 --> 02:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
keeping track which smaller firms would
 
02:45:10.190 --> 02:45:10.200 align:start position:0%
not uh most of the firms that I
 
02:45:12.469 --> 02:45:12.479 align:start position:0%
represent are larger construction firms
 
02:45:15.269 --> 02:45:15.279 align:start position:0%
that already have set in place uh very
 
02:45:18.190 --> 02:45:18.200 align:start position:0%
specific policies regarding sick leave
 
02:45:20.790 --> 02:45:20.800 align:start position:0%
and therefore I think it's uh from our
 
02:45:22.630 --> 02:45:22.640 align:start position:0%
position it would be
 
02:45:25.990 --> 02:45:26.000 align:start position:0%
a uh not a good policy to start writing
 
02:45:28.990 --> 02:45:29.000 align:start position:0%
these uh individual company policies
 
02:45:32.030 --> 02:45:32.040 align:start position:0%
into State statutes uh with that we
 
02:45:33.550 --> 02:45:33.560 align:start position:0%
would hope that the committee would vote
 
02:45:35.550 --> 02:45:35.560 align:start position:0%
this bill in expedient and I would end
 
02:45:37.950 --> 02:45:37.960 align:start position:0%
my testimony there thank you very much
 
02:45:40.630 --> 02:45:40.640 align:start position:0%

Focus for the New Hampshire women's

Foundation are women in the workforce

and women as caregivers and those are
 
02:46:45.790 --> 02:46:45.800 align:start position:0%
two issues that are particularly
 
02:46:48.389 --> 02:46:48.399 align:start position:0%
highlighted by The Proposal before you
 
02:46:50.950 --> 02:46:50.960 align:start position:0%
today the women's Foundation has been

02:46:57.510 --> 02:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
pandemic uh across the state both
 
02:46:59.150 --> 02:46:59.160 align:start position:0%
through the funding that we provide to
 
02:47:03.309 --> 02:47:03.319 align:start position:0%
local nonprofits and also to research um
 
02:47:05.590 --> 02:47:05.600 align:start position:0%
that we commissioned earlier this year
 
02:47:09.070 --> 02:47:09.080 align:start position:0%
in partnership with darkmouth um I did
 
02:47:10.510 --> 02:47:10.520 align:start position:0%
cause to be delivered into your
 
02:47:13.110 --> 02:47:13.120 align:start position:0%
mailboxes earlier this morning before
 
02:47:14.990 --> 02:47:15.000 align:start position:0%
the 10:00 a.m. originally scheduled
 
02:47:17.550 --> 02:47:17.560 align:start position:0%
hearing a copy of a four-page data
 
02:47:19.389 --> 02:47:19.399 align:start position:0%
report that we just put out at the end
 
02:47:21.429 --> 02:47:21.439 align:start position:0%
of 2020 that I'm going to be referring
 
02:47:23.590 --> 02:47:23.600 align:start position:0%
to just a little bit um in some key
 
02:47:24.750 --> 02:47:24.760 align:start position:0%
points of my
 
02:47:27.670 --> 02:47:27.680 align:start position:0%
testimony um the larger summary of being
 
02:47:29.309 --> 02:47:29.319 align:start position:0%
that women are carrying a
 
02:47:31.150 --> 02:47:31.160 align:start position:0%
disproportionate number of the health
 
02:47:33.630 --> 02:47:33.640 align:start position:0%
and economic burdens in our state as we
 
02:47:36.630 --> 02:47:36.640 align:start position:0%
move through coid and women need the
 
02:47:39.269 --> 02:47:39.279 align:start position:0%
legislature to be prioritizing public
 
02:47:40.910 --> 02:47:40.920 align:start position:0%
policies that are going to help them be
 
02:47:43.710 --> 02:47:43.720 align:start position:0%
an equal part of the recovery so some of
 
02:47:45.750 --> 02:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
the key findings of the report that we
 
02:47:48.429 --> 02:47:48.439 align:start position:0%
looked at over nine months of women's
 
02:47:51.309 --> 02:47:51.319 align:start position:0%
experience with coid um concluded that
 
02:47:53.190 --> 02:47:53.200 align:start position:0%
women are experiencing a higher
 
02:47:56.510 --> 02:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
percentage of coid cases and coid
 
02:47:59.150 --> 02:47:59.160 align:start position:0%
deaths that female workers face
 
02:48:01.950 --> 02:48:01.960 align:start position:0%
increased occupational hazards because
 
02:48:04.590 --> 02:48:04.600 align:start position:0%
of their over representation in the jobs
 
02:48:07.550 --> 02:48:07.560 align:start position:0%
that are viewed are essential uh
 
02:48:09.870 --> 02:48:09.880 align:start position:0%
Workforce or our Frontline occupations
 
02:48:12.030 --> 02:48:12.040 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire that 68% of that
 
02:48:13.349 --> 02:48:13.359 align:start position:0%
Workforce is
 
02:48:16.070 --> 02:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
women that more women are losing
 
02:48:18.349 --> 02:48:18.359 align:start position:0%
employment and earnings as a result of
 
02:48:20.990 --> 02:48:21.000 align:start position:0%
the pandemic than men and I document the
 
02:48:23.309 --> 02:48:23.319 align:start position:0%
unemployment trends that have shown this
 
02:48:26.309 --> 02:48:26.319 align:start position:0%
as well as um the typical the different
 
02:48:28.349 --> 02:48:28.359 align:start position:0%
types of economic sectors where women do
 
02:48:30.230 --> 02:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
and don't have the flexibility to work
 
02:48:32.309 --> 02:48:32.319 align:start position:0%
at home and how that impacts their
 
02:48:34.030 --> 02:48:34.040 align:start position:0%
economic opportunities and their need
 
02:48:37.389 --> 02:48:37.399 align:start position:0%
for sick leave um and then finally um
 
02:48:39.630 --> 02:48:39.640 align:start position:0%
across the state and across the country
 
02:48:42.070 --> 02:48:42.080 align:start position:0%
um most of the responsibility for
 
02:48:44.190 --> 02:48:44.200 align:start position:0%
caregiving whether it's as a result of
 
02:48:47.830 --> 02:48:47.840 align:start position:0%
disrupted child care or disrupted um
 
02:48:50.309 --> 02:48:50.319 align:start position:0%
School access and remote school and
 
02:48:53.510 --> 02:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
hybrid school is falling on women and so
 
02:48:57.030 --> 02:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
this is a very important bill um to make
 
02:48:59.950 --> 02:48:59.960 align:start position:0%
certain that women have the opportunity
 
02:49:04.349 --> 02:49:04.359 align:start position:0%
to have uh the time that they need and
 
02:49:06.590 --> 02:49:06.600 align:start position:0%
the economic support that they need the
 
02:49:09.469 --> 02:49:09.479 align:start position:0%
very same industries that where women
 
02:49:11.429 --> 02:49:11.439 align:start position:0%
are over represented in New Hampshire
 
02:49:13.150 --> 02:49:13.160 align:start position:0%
that has them spending more time on the
 
02:49:15.710 --> 02:49:15.720 align:start position:0%
Frontline of this pandemic are many of
 
02:49:17.910 --> 02:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
the lower wage industries that are less
 
02:49:21.309 --> 02:49:21.319 align:start position:0%
likely to uh provide benefits like sick
 
02:49:23.229 --> 02:49:23.239 align:start position:0%
Leaf similarly as you've heard from
 
02:49:26.309 --> 02:49:26.319 align:start position:0%
previous uh Witnesses today um women are
 
02:49:28.590 --> 02:49:28.600 align:start position:0%
more likely to carry multiple part-time
 
02:49:30.630 --> 02:49:30.640 align:start position:0%
jobs than their male counterparts and as
 
02:49:32.990 --> 02:49:33.000 align:start position:0%
a result they're likely to have less
 
02:49:36.910 --> 02:49:36.920 align:start position:0%
access to sick leave the need for paid
 
02:49:39.389 --> 02:49:39.399 align:start position:0%
sick daes is more urgent than ever and
 
02:49:41.790 --> 02:49:41.800 align:start position:0%
we know that if we continue to force
 
02:49:43.349 --> 02:49:43.359 align:start position:0%
women who are in some of the most
 
02:49:46.309 --> 02:49:46.319 align:start position:0%
vulnerable economic situ situations um
 
02:49:48.229 --> 02:49:48.239 align:start position:0%
to choose between their financial
 
02:49:49.790 --> 02:49:49.800 align:start position:0%
well-being and the health of their
 
02:49:52.349 --> 02:49:52.359 align:start position:0%
family and Community they will have no
 
02:49:54.550 --> 02:49:54.560 align:start position:0%
choice but to choose their own economic
 
02:49:56.590 --> 02:49:56.600 align:start position:0%
survival um there have been several
 
02:49:58.790 --> 02:49:58.800 align:start position:0%
economists um including a few here at
 
02:50:00.710 --> 02:50:00.720 align:start position:0%
the state who have said that the best
 
02:50:03.910 --> 02:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
economic stimulus for us to move our way
 
02:50:07.950 --> 02:50:07.960 align:start position:0%
out of this pandemic and um in Inspire
 
02:50:10.429 --> 02:50:10.439 align:start position:0%
and um generate the state economy is to
 
02:50:13.110 --> 02:50:13.120 align:start position:0%
make sure um that women have the same
 
02:50:16.030 --> 02:50:16.040 align:start position:0%
access to return to full employment and
 
02:50:18.349 --> 02:50:18.359 align:start position:0%
to retain the flexibility and employment
 
02:50:19.990 --> 02:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
that they have for their fam's health
 
02:50:23.750 --> 02:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
and well-being and therefore um we
 
02:50:25.229 --> 02:50:25.239 align:start position:0%
strongly not only believe that this is
 
02:50:27.590 --> 02:50:27.600 align:start position:0%
an important policy for women and men
 
02:50:29.429 --> 02:50:29.439 align:start position:0%
and for the health of our families and
 
02:50:31.830 --> 02:50:31.840 align:start position:0%
communities but it's also a critical
 
02:50:34.590 --> 02:50:34.600 align:start position:0%
policy inclosing the gender disparity
 
02:50:36.870 --> 02:50:36.880 align:start position:0%
that now exists in the state with regard
 
02:50:39.630 --> 02:50:39.640 align:start position:0%
to who has sick leave and who does not
 
02:50:41.070 --> 02:50:41.080 align:start position:0%
so with that I'll thank you for the
 
02:50:44.630 --> 02:50:44.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify and certainly
 
02:50:46.590 --> 02:50:46.600 align:start position:0%

bill and then I'll followed by Joel I I

hear me okay yes thank you uh for the
 
02:51:30.030 --> 02:51:30.040 align:start position:0%
record my name is Dave juv I'm a senior
 
02:51:32.110 --> 02:51:32.120 align:start position:0%
vice president for public policy at the
 
02:51:35.190 --> 02:51:35.200 align:start position:0%
business and industry Association we are
 
02:51:38.349 --> 02:51:38.359 align:start position:0%
here uh this morning in opposition to
 
02:51:41.750 --> 02:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
House Bill 590 our objection to the bill
 
02:51:44.550 --> 02:51:44.560 align:start position:0%
is twofold one is philosophical and one
 
02:51:47.070 --> 02:51:47.080 align:start position:0%
one is practical the philosophical one
 
02:51:48.830 --> 02:51:48.840 align:start position:0%
has already been touched on by other
 
02:51:50.670 --> 02:51:50.680 align:start position:0%
speakers who are opposed to the
 
02:51:53.349 --> 02:51:53.359 align:start position:0%
legislation recognizing that it doesn't
 
02:51:56.349 --> 02:51:56.359 align:start position:0%
really make sense to for the state to
 
02:51:59.550 --> 02:51:59.560 align:start position:0%
require a one-size fits-all employee
 
02:52:01.950 --> 02:52:01.960 align:start position:0%
benefit I assure you that businesses
 
02:52:03.590 --> 02:52:03.600 align:start position:0%
large and small understand the
 
02:52:06.750 --> 02:52:06.760 align:start position:0%
importance of a paid sick leave benefit
 
02:52:08.190 --> 02:52:08.200 align:start position:0%
and the businesses that are not
 
02:52:10.710 --> 02:52:10.720 align:start position:0%
providing it are not doing so because
 
02:52:12.389 --> 02:52:12.399 align:start position:0%
they don't recognize the importance of
 
02:52:13.950 --> 02:52:13.960 align:start position:0%
it they're doing so because they don't
 
02:52:16.950 --> 02:52:16.960 align:start position:0%
have the fin fincial resources to offer
 
02:52:19.190 --> 02:52:19.200 align:start position:0%
such a benefit every company in New
 
02:52:21.110 --> 02:52:21.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire right now is in competition
 
02:52:24.510 --> 02:52:24.520 align:start position:0%
for employees and every employer
 
02:52:27.750 --> 02:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
understands uh what they need to do and
 
02:52:29.349 --> 02:52:29.359 align:start position:0%
what they need to provide in terms of
 
02:52:31.830 --> 02:52:31.840 align:start position:0%
employee benefits to both attract and
 
02:52:35.469 --> 02:52:35.479 align:start position:0%
retrain um retain employees so I would
 
02:52:39.309 --> 02:52:39.319 align:start position:0%
ask that the committee um find this PO
 
02:52:41.670 --> 02:52:41.680 align:start position:0%
an expedient the other area I mentioned
 
02:52:43.750 --> 02:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
is a practical one and it relates
 
02:52:47.269 --> 02:52:47.279 align:start position:0%
directly to the Co 19 pandemic right now
 
02:52:49.389 --> 02:52:49.399 align:start position:0%
there are many businesses probably many
 
02:52:51.910 --> 02:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
of the ones who uh are not able to
 
02:52:54.670 --> 02:52:54.680 align:start position:0%
provide a uh paid sick leave benefit
 
02:52:56.910 --> 02:52:56.920 align:start position:0%
that're in a life and death struggle to
 
02:52:59.229 --> 02:52:59.239 align:start position:0%
survive and passing this type of
 
02:53:01.670 --> 02:53:01.680 align:start position:0%
legislation which would create uh
 
02:53:04.550 --> 02:53:04.560 align:start position:0%
extraordinary costs on the part of some
 
02:53:06.870 --> 02:53:06.880 align:start position:0%
businesses uh may be the Tipping Point
 
02:53:08.950 --> 02:53:08.960 align:start position:0%
that would put them out of business and
 
02:53:10.910 --> 02:53:10.920 align:start position:0%
I don't think that would be in either
 
02:53:13.190 --> 02:53:13.200 align:start position:0%
the best interest of the state or the
 
02:53:15.389 --> 02:53:15.399 align:start position:0%
employees that are currently working so
 
02:53:17.670 --> 02:53:17.680 align:start position:0%
i' would ask you to oppose this Bill
 
02:53:19.110 --> 02:53:19.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'd be happy to
 
02:53:20.349 --> 02:53:20.359 align:start position:0%
answer any
 
02:53:23.349 --> 02:53:23.359 align:start position:0%
questions any questions for the speaker
 
02:53:25.710 --> 02:53:25.720 align:start position:0%
here in the committee
 
02:53:29.349 --> 02:53:29.359 align:start position:0%
room seeing none on uh committee members
 
02:53:31.630 --> 02:53:31.640 align:start position:0%
on Zoom I will recognize representative
 
02:53:31.640 --> 02:53:32.590 align:start position:0%
on Zoom I will recognize representative
Michael

02:53:32.590 --> 02:53:32.600 align:start position:0%
Michael
 
02:53:35.389 --> 02:53:35.399 align:start position:0%
kahill thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:53:39.190 --> 02:53:39.200 align:start position:0%
uh Mr juv for taking my question um I
 
02:53:40.790 --> 02:53:40.800 align:start position:0%
understand that businesses are having a
 
02:53:43.469 --> 02:53:43.479 align:start position:0%
very difficult time but the the it's the
 
02:53:45.830 --> 02:53:45.840 align:start position:0%
employees of the these businesses that
 
02:53:48.510 --> 02:53:48.520 align:start position:0%
are also having a very difficult time
 
02:53:50.429 --> 02:53:50.439 align:start position:0%
and if they don't earn much money to
 
02:53:52.110 --> 02:53:52.120 align:start position:0%
begin with they're working
 
02:53:54.990 --> 02:53:55.000 align:start position:0%
part-time and then they get sick and
 
02:53:56.750 --> 02:53:56.760 align:start position:0%
they they can't come to work and then
 
02:53:59.269 --> 02:53:59.279 align:start position:0%
they can't pay this bill or that bill or
 
02:54:01.710 --> 02:54:01.720 align:start position:0%
fix their car so again they can't go to
 
02:54:05.150 --> 02:54:05.160 align:start position:0%
work um what is the what would
 
02:54:08.510 --> 02:54:08.520 align:start position:0%
the how can we motivate if we can't reg
 
02:54:10.670 --> 02:54:10.680 align:start position:0%
legislate how can we motivate these
 
02:54:12.910 --> 02:54:12.920 align:start position:0%
businesses who you say are are not
 
02:54:14.910 --> 02:54:14.920 align:start position:0%
choosing because they don't like the
 
02:54:16.830 --> 02:54:16.840 align:start position:0%
concept that but that they can't afford
 
02:54:20.630 --> 02:54:20.640 align:start position:0%
it it maybe if you can't afford to
 
02:54:22.630 --> 02:54:22.640 align:start position:0%
provide for your employees then you
 
02:54:25.630 --> 02:54:25.640 align:start position:0%
really can't afford a
 
02:54:30.190 --> 02:54:30.200 align:start position:0%
business well uh I would suggest that
 
02:54:32.990 --> 02:54:33.000 align:start position:0%
this bill represents uh somewhat of a a
 
02:54:35.630 --> 02:54:35.640 align:start position:0%
downward death spiral and I would
 
02:54:38.670 --> 02:54:38.680 align:start position:0%
suggest that although a uh person
 
02:54:41.670 --> 02:54:41.680 align:start position:0%
working a lower wage job and without a
 
02:54:44.269 --> 02:54:44.279 align:start position:0%
paid sick leave benefit is not ideal for
 
02:54:46.910 --> 02:54:46.920 align:start position:0%
for that individual being unemployed
 
02:54:48.309 --> 02:54:48.319 align:start position:0%
because the business goes out of
 
02:54:51.349 --> 02:54:51.359 align:start position:0%
business is even less
 
02:54:54.349 --> 02:54:54.359 align:start position:0%
ideal thank you I do I appreciate that
 
02:54:57.550 --> 02:54:57.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:00.269 --> 02:55:00.279 align:start position:0%
you representative agitant has a
 
02:55:02.670 --> 02:55:02.680 align:start position:0%
question you recognized speak thank you
 
02:55:06.670 --> 02:55:06.680 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um I wanted to follow up on
 
02:55:09.790 --> 02:55:09.800 align:start position:0%
um comment you made about uh businesses
 
02:55:12.229 --> 02:55:12.239 align:start position:0%
going out of business and this might be
 
02:55:13.950 --> 02:55:13.960 align:start position:0%
the Tipping Point that sends certain
 
02:55:16.550 --> 02:55:16.560 align:start position:0%
business businesses out um I will be
 
02:55:20.429 --> 02:55:20.439 align:start position:0%
generous and use the uh math that a
 
02:55:25.150 --> 02:55:25.160 align:start position:0%
prior speaker used um in order to um you
 
02:55:27.269 --> 02:55:27.279 align:start position:0%
know have a more conservative estimate
 
02:55:31.110 --> 02:55:31.120 align:start position:0%
um when I did the math timing eight days
 
02:55:34.550 --> 02:55:34.560 align:start position:0%
of available paid sick leave the year uh
 
02:55:38.870 --> 02:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
times eight hours a day uh times $10 an
 
02:55:42.870 --> 02:55:42.880 align:start position:0%
hour which is about the um what I'm
 
02:55:45.070 --> 02:55:45.080 align:start position:0%
assuming is a lower wage that still puts
 
02:55:47.429 --> 02:55:47.439 align:start position:0%
that person competitive but puts them
 
02:55:50.469 --> 02:55:50.479 align:start position:0%
out of range for uh you know the
 
02:55:51.790 --> 02:55:51.800 align:start position:0%
benefits that you'd get at a larger
 
02:55:54.150 --> 02:55:54.160 align:start position:0%
business we're talking about
 
02:55:58.630 --> 02:55:58.640 align:start position:0%
$640 a year uh per each employee at one
 
02:56:01.110 --> 02:56:01.120 align:start position:0%
of these small businesses that uh would
 
02:56:03.550 --> 02:56:03.560 align:start position:0%
theoretically be crippled by this
 
02:56:08.070 --> 02:56:08.080 align:start position:0%
devastating legislation um does that
 
02:56:10.750 --> 02:56:10.760 align:start position:0%
really Square um do you think
 
02:56:13.710 --> 02:56:13.720 align:start position:0%
$640 or even $700 per employee would
 
02:56:16.070 --> 02:56:16.080 align:start position:0%
really destroy uh some of these
 
02:56:18.150 --> 02:56:18.160 align:start position:0%
businesses that otherwise would struggle
 
02:56:21.550 --> 02:56:21.560 align:start position:0%
to um comply with this
 
02:56:23.670 --> 02:56:23.680 align:start position:0%
legislation uh thank you representative
 
02:56:25.630 --> 02:56:25.640 align:start position:0%
I guess I would respectfully suggest it
 
02:56:28.510 --> 02:56:28.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter what I think I assure you
 
02:56:30.389 --> 02:56:30.399 align:start position:0%
that small business people are equally
 
02:56:33.110 --> 02:56:33.120 align:start position:0%
good at math and that they provide the
 
02:56:36.550 --> 02:56:36.560 align:start position:0%
benefit packages that they uh are able
 
02:56:39.550 --> 02:56:39.560 align:start position:0%
to provide to attract and retain
 
02:56:44.349 --> 02:56:44.359 align:start position:0%
employees um so I um don't really know
 
02:56:46.030 --> 02:56:46.040 align:start position:0%
how many would be driven out of business
 
02:56:47.630 --> 02:56:47.640 align:start position:0%
by this but I can tell you that the
 
02:56:50.150 --> 02:56:50.160 align:start position:0%
struggle right now is real and that
 
02:56:52.429 --> 02:56:52.439 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of businesses smaller
 
02:56:54.630 --> 02:56:54.640 align:start position:0%
businesses especially businesses in the
 
02:56:58.150 --> 02:56:58.160 align:start position:0%
uh travel and tourism uh related sector
 
02:57:00.750 --> 02:57:00.760 align:start position:0%
of our economies restaurants uh small
 
02:57:03.990 --> 02:57:04.000 align:start position:0%
hotels that are really hurting right now
 
02:57:09.830 --> 02:57:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:15.630 --> 02:57:15.640 align:start position:0%
burden thank you any other questions
 
02:57:19.750 --> 02:57:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:21.870 --> 02:57:21.880 align:start position:0%
point I can't see it there I can see it
 
02:57:24.070 --> 02:57:24.080 align:start position:0%
up there represent representative
 
02:57:27.070 --> 02:57:27.080 align:start position:0%
avalani has a question I don't see it on
 
02:57:27.080 --> 02:57:27.750 align:start position:0%
avalani has a question I don't see it on
my

02:57:27.750 --> 02:57:27.760 align:start position:0%
my
 
02:57:29.590 --> 02:57:29.600 align:start position:0%
screen he's
 
02:57:32.590 --> 02:57:32.600 align:start position:0%
there I see I see his screen I don't see
 
02:57:34.990 --> 02:57:35.000 align:start position:0%
a yellow hands up but representative
 
02:57:38.110 --> 02:57:38.120 align:start position:0%
aini if you recognized to um a question
 
02:57:39.550 --> 02:57:39.560 align:start position:0%
if you have
 
02:57:42.110 --> 02:57:42.120 align:start position:0%
one it's actually a comment Mr chairman
 
02:57:45.469 --> 02:57:45.479 align:start position:0%
if I may y
 
02:57:47.750 --> 02:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
um I I'd like some clarification on
 
02:57:49.830 --> 02:57:49.840 align:start position:0%
representative kill's comment that if
 
02:57:51.950 --> 02:57:51.960 align:start position:0%
people can't afford SI time that they
 
02:57:53.389 --> 02:57:53.399 align:start position:0%
can't afford a business I'm I just want
 
02:57:59.229 --> 02:57:59.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:02.410 --> 02:58:02.420 align:start position:0%
correctly I did I
 
02:58:02.420 --> 02:58:04.429 align:start position:0%
correctly I did I
[Music]

02:58:04.429 --> 02:58:04.439 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:58:08.429 --> 02:58:08.439 align:start position:0%
reply that is how I understood
 
02:58:11.550 --> 02:58:11.560 align:start position:0%
it any other questions thank you Mr I
 
02:58:13.590 --> 02:58:13.600 align:start position:0%
have a question for Mr duv if I could as
 
02:58:15.870 --> 02:58:15.880 align:start position:0%
well go ahead you
 
02:58:18.150 --> 02:58:18.160 align:start position:0%
recognize thank you and thank you Mr du
 
02:58:20.469 --> 02:58:20.479 align:start position:0%
for taking the question um could you
 
02:58:23.190 --> 02:58:23.200 align:start position:0%
respond upon the hospitality industry
 
02:58:25.630 --> 02:58:25.640 align:start position:0%
and the devast and the issues that we're
 
02:58:28.510 --> 02:58:28.520 align:start position:0%
facing at this particular time with um
 
02:58:30.870 --> 02:58:30.880 align:start position:0%
employees um having to
 
02:58:36.469 --> 02:58:36.479 align:start position:0%
close um due to potential issues um the
 
02:58:38.710 --> 02:58:38.720 align:start position:0%
lack of distancing between tables and
 
02:58:40.950 --> 02:58:40.960 align:start position:0%
those ideas there that allow us to
 
02:58:44.510 --> 02:58:44.520 align:start position:0%
operate at a severely reduced capacity
 
02:58:46.750 --> 02:58:46.760 align:start position:0%
um and that this would be a burden at
 
02:58:49.229 --> 02:58:49.239 align:start position:0%
this time to imply on every small
 
02:58:52.070 --> 02:58:52.080 align:start position:0%
business in the state yes I think the
 
02:58:53.670 --> 02:58:53.680 align:start position:0%
pressure is coming from two different
 
02:58:56.990 --> 02:58:57.000 align:start position:0%
areas one is external and the reality is
 
02:59:01.790 --> 02:59:01.800 align:start position:0%
because of Co 19 and um uh guidelines
 
02:59:03.550 --> 02:59:03.560 align:start position:0%
that are in place not just in New
 
02:59:06.429 --> 02:59:06.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but around the country people
 
02:59:09.630 --> 02:59:09.640 align:start position:0%
are making decisions to travel less than
 
02:59:12.510 --> 02:59:12.520 align:start position:0%
they normally would and that's probably
 
02:59:14.070 --> 02:59:14.080 align:start position:0%
a good thing in fact it's I'm certain
 
02:59:16.429 --> 02:59:16.439 align:start position:0%
it's a good thing is is a method for
 
02:59:19.870 --> 02:59:19.880 align:start position:0%
reducing the uh spread of uh Corona
 
02:59:24.030 --> 02:59:24.040 align:start position:0%
virus so right away restaurants and and
 
02:59:26.910 --> 02:59:26.920 align:start position:0%
other Hospitality oriented businesses
 
02:59:31.590 --> 02:59:31.600 align:start position:0%
are um seeing less demand for what they
 
02:59:35.110 --> 02:59:35.120 align:start position:0%
can provide on top of that are uh issues
 
02:59:37.229 --> 02:59:37.239 align:start position:0%
that you raised uh New Hampshire
 
02:59:40.750 --> 02:59:40.760 align:start position:0%
specific guidelines in terms of uh
 
02:59:43.830 --> 02:59:43.840 align:start position:0%
number of customers that are able to be
 
02:59:46.870 --> 02:59:46.880 align:start position:0%
let in the dividers that need to be put
 
02:59:49.190 --> 02:59:49.200 align:start position:0%
up the uh social distancing that needs
 
02:59:53.150 --> 02:59:53.160 align:start position:0%
to be in place all of these have
 
02:59:53.160 --> 02:59:54.710 align:start position:0%
to be in place all of these have
um

02:59:54.710 --> 02:59:54.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:59:58.830 --> 02:59:58.840 align:start position:0%
caused our customers and revenue at
 
03:00:02.150 --> 03:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
restaurants to go down and that probably
 
03:00:05.190 --> 03:00:05.200 align:start position:0%
won't change until you know a sufficient
 
03:00:08.110 --> 03:00:08.120 align:start position:0%
number of us have been vaccinated and we
 
03:00:13.309 --> 03:00:13.319 align:start position:0%
see a a a pretty significant downturn in
 
03:00:17.070 --> 03:00:17.080 align:start position:0%
the uh incidents of of people uh uh
 
03:00:22.630 --> 03:00:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:26.670 --> 03:00:26.680 align:start position:0%
disease all right thank you any further
 
03:00:26.680 --> 03:00:28.269 align:start position:0%
disease all right thank you any further
questions

03:00:28.269 --> 03:00:28.279 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:00:31.309 --> 03:00:31.319 align:start position:0%
Josh representative
 
03:00:34.309 --> 03:00:34.319 align:start position:0%
kale thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
03:00:38.190 --> 03:00:38.200 align:start position:0%
Mr J uh while I appreciate that the
 
03:00:39.910 --> 03:00:39.920 align:start position:0%
times are especially difficult for the
 
03:00:42.150 --> 03:00:42.160 align:start position:0%
restaurants and hotels and and many
 
03:00:44.870 --> 03:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
Industries um would you agree that this
 
03:00:47.030 --> 03:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
bill if if it were to pass would not
 
03:00:49.990 --> 03:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
take effect until until the summer at
 
03:00:51.630 --> 03:00:51.640 align:start position:0%
the earliest and that certainly they
 
03:00:53.550 --> 03:00:53.560 align:start position:0%
would be some opportunity to be phased
 
03:00:57.429 --> 03:00:57.439 align:start position:0%
in or perhaps adjust this uh I I don't
 
03:00:59.710 --> 03:00:59.720 align:start position:0%
know that we can legislate for
 
03:01:03.030 --> 03:01:03.040 align:start position:0%
conditions that that are here now and
 
03:01:06.670 --> 03:01:06.680 align:start position:0%
will Pro will most likely not continue
 
03:01:06.680 --> 03:01:09.910 align:start position:0%
will Pro will most likely not continue
uh

03:01:09.910 --> 03:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:13.190 --> 03:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
indefinitely I represent kill uh thank
 
03:01:15.349 --> 03:01:15.359 align:start position:0%
you I don't have the same confidence
 
03:01:17.110 --> 03:01:17.120 align:start position:0%
that you do that things are going to be
 
03:01:20.150 --> 03:01:20.160 align:start position:0%
dramatically improved by the summertime
 
03:01:22.630 --> 03:01:22.640 align:start position:0%
I think there will be a gradual
 
03:01:24.790 --> 03:01:24.800 align:start position:0%
Improvement is uh the New Hampshire
 
03:01:27.269 --> 03:01:27.279 align:start position:0%
population and the population around the
 
03:01:30.469 --> 03:01:30.479 align:start position:0%
country uh gets vaccinated but I think
 
03:01:32.550 --> 03:01:32.560 align:start position:0%
everyone agrees that is going to take
 
03:01:37.269 --> 03:01:37.279 align:start position:0%
some time to happen and but aside from
 
03:01:39.630 --> 03:01:39.640 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't really address bia's
 
03:01:42.790 --> 03:01:42.800 align:start position:0%
concern which is we don't think it's the
 
03:01:44.710 --> 03:01:44.720 align:start position:0%
appropriate role for the state to
 
03:01:47.550 --> 03:01:47.560 align:start position:0%
mandate one size fits-all employee
 
03:01:50.389 --> 03:01:50.399 align:start position:0%
benefits every company is different some
 
03:01:54.030 --> 03:01:54.040 align:start position:0%
companies have the ability to offer very
 
03:01:57.190 --> 03:01:57.200 align:start position:0%
generous benefits other companies are
 
03:01:59.830 --> 03:01:59.840 align:start position:0%
such that they don't have the ability to
 
03:02:03.070 --> 03:02:03.080 align:start position:0%
offer uh the same
 
03:02:05.030 --> 03:02:05.040 align:start position:0%
level thank
 
03:02:07.590 --> 03:02:07.600 align:start position:0%

03:02:08.790 --> 03:02:08.800 align:start position:0%

had planned to have a phone call Caucus
 
03:02:41.790 --> 03:02:41.800 align:start position:0%
with the Republican members of the
 
03:02:44.510 --> 03:02:44.520 align:start position:0%
committee at noon uh for those that
 
03:02:46.910 --> 03:02:46.920 align:start position:0%
could have attended uh via phone and
 
03:02:48.469 --> 03:02:48.479 align:start position:0%
those in person we're going we're not
 
03:02:49.630 --> 03:02:49.640 align:start position:0%
going to do that today I'll have to

reschedule that to some other
 
03:02:55.510 --> 03:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
time so with that I will continue on
 
03:02:56.750 --> 03:02:56.760 align:start position:0%
unless there's any questions other the
 
03:02:56.760 --> 03:02:58.550 align:start position:0%
unless there's any questions other the
committee

03:02:58.550 --> 03:02:58.560 align:start position:0%

you hear me yes ma'am okay thank you I
 
03:04:02.429 --> 03:04:02.439 align:start position:0%
have a daughter with a chronic health
 
03:04:04.349 --> 03:04:04.359 align:start position:0%
condition when she was diagnosed with
 
03:04:07.429 --> 03:04:07.439 align:start position:0%
type 1 diabetes at the age of two she
 
03:04:09.950 --> 03:04:09.960 align:start position:0%
spent uh time in a hospital and we had
 
03:04:12.389 --> 03:04:12.399 align:start position:0%
uh subsequently had multiple Medical in
 
03:04:14.389 --> 03:04:14.399 align:start position:0%
incidents that required constant
 
03:04:16.670 --> 03:04:16.680 align:start position:0%
attention uh we alternated staying with
 
03:04:18.590 --> 03:04:18.600 align:start position:0%
her in the hospital for one of us it was
 
03:04:21.389 --> 03:04:21.399 align:start position:0%
tough to manage with the employer in
 
03:04:23.389 --> 03:04:23.399 align:start position:0%
addition a child with a seral serious
 
03:04:26.110 --> 03:04:26.120 align:start position:0%
medical illness creates economic stress
 
03:04:27.990 --> 03:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
putting parents in advice between caring
 
03:04:30.389 --> 03:04:30.399 align:start position:0%
for their child and their employment
 
03:04:31.910 --> 03:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
it's more difficult when one does not
 
03:04:33.990 --> 03:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
have pay time off from work to make all
 
03:04:36.550 --> 03:04:36.560 align:start position:0%
necessary appointments for their child
 
03:04:38.590 --> 03:04:38.600 align:start position:0%
um so many families in New Hampshire are
 
03:04:41.510 --> 03:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
in this situation right now we we made
 
03:04:43.790 --> 03:04:43.800 align:start position:0%
it work and our employers did what they
 
03:04:45.429 --> 03:04:45.439 align:start position:0%
could but it shouldn't come down to
 
03:04:47.190 --> 03:04:47.200 align:start position:0%
having a good employer for parents to
 
03:04:50.389 --> 03:04:50.399 align:start position:0%
ensure the child will get necessary care
 
03:04:53.070 --> 03:04:53.080 align:start position:0%
and still pay their bills the pandemic
 
03:04:54.830 --> 03:04:54.840 align:start position:0%
has made this even harder for working
 
03:04:56.950 --> 03:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
families and I urge you to pass this
 
03:05:00.349 --> 03:05:00.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:02.510 --> 03:05:02.520 align:start position:0%

Bill 590 again my name is Amy Brady and
 
03:06:04.349 --> 03:06:04.359 align:start position:0%
I live in Hollis New
 
03:06:06.550 --> 03:06:06.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire first and foremost I'm a
 
03:06:10.550 --> 03:06:10.560 align:start position:0%
mother of two uh a career uh employee
 
03:06:13.269 --> 03:06:13.279 align:start position:0%
and spouse of a combat veteran uh both
 
03:06:14.910 --> 03:06:14.920 align:start position:0%
most my children have life-threatening
 
03:06:17.750 --> 03:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
chronic medical conditions one my
 
03:06:19.990 --> 03:06:20.000 align:start position:0%
99-year-old daughter uh was diagnosed
 
03:06:23.190 --> 03:06:23.200 align:start position:0%
with type 1 diabetes um and she is
 
03:06:23.200 --> 03:06:24.429 align:start position:0%
with type 1 diabetes um and she is
currently

03:06:24.429 --> 03:06:24.439 align:start position:0%
currently
 
03:06:28.030 --> 03:06:28.040 align:start position:0%
nine I've had to use paid sick leave
 
03:06:29.630 --> 03:06:29.640 align:start position:0%
through my employer but that's not
 
03:06:31.550 --> 03:06:31.560 align:start position:0%
always the case and sometimes I have to
 
03:06:34.110 --> 03:06:34.120 align:start position:0%
take leave without pay I have often had
 
03:06:36.870 --> 03:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
to miss workk to ensure that she gets to
 
03:06:39.269 --> 03:06:39.279 align:start position:0%
her numerous monthly doctor's
 
03:06:41.750 --> 03:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
appointments working people should have
 
03:06:45.229 --> 03:06:45.239 align:start position:0%
access to paid sick time no family
 
03:06:47.510 --> 03:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
should have to choose between a paycheck
 
03:06:49.510 --> 03:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
or taking care of a child with a chronic
 
03:06:53.349 --> 03:06:53.359 align:start position:0%
illness but too often this impacts every
 
03:06:55.229 --> 03:06:55.239 align:start position:0%
everything for a parent with a child
 
03:06:57.070 --> 03:06:57.080 align:start position:0%
with a chronic illness in terms of
 
03:07:00.229 --> 03:07:00.239 align:start position:0%
long-term Economic Security not just
 
03:07:02.790 --> 03:07:02.800 align:start position:0%
paying bills but retirement use of
 
03:07:05.110 --> 03:07:05.120 align:start position:0%
Public Assistance programs unemployment
 
03:07:06.630 --> 03:07:06.640 align:start position:0%
costs and health care
 
03:07:09.670 --> 03:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
benefits for caregivers without access
 
03:07:13.469 --> 03:07:13.479 align:start position:0%
to paid sick time it is categorically
 
03:07:15.870 --> 03:07:15.880 align:start position:0%
difficult to make ends meet even for
 
03:07:19.950 --> 03:07:19.960 align:start position:0%
caregivers who do have sick time such as
 
03:07:22.710 --> 03:07:22.720 align:start position:0%
myself we end up using most of it to
 
03:07:25.309 --> 03:07:25.319 align:start position:0%
take care of our sick loved ones and
 
03:07:27.349 --> 03:07:27.359 align:start position:0%
we're often left without time to take
 
03:07:29.030 --> 03:07:29.040 align:start position:0%
care of
 
03:07:31.950 --> 03:07:31.960 align:start position:0%
ourselves and as someone who identifies
 
03:07:33.990 --> 03:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
with a person with a disability it's a
 
03:07:34.000 --> 03:07:34.830 align:start position:0%
with a person with a disability it's a
real

03:07:34.830 --> 03:07:34.840 align:start position:0%
real
 
03:07:37.750 --> 03:07:37.760 align:start position:0%
problem the driving concept of economic
 
03:07:39.910 --> 03:07:39.920 align:start position:0%
legislation is to correct failures of
 
03:07:41.190 --> 03:07:41.200 align:start position:0%
the market
 
03:07:44.070 --> 03:07:44.080 align:start position:0%
economy paid sick leave as it stands
 
03:07:46.710 --> 03:07:46.720 align:start position:0%
today is a failure we encourage citizens
 
03:07:49.710 --> 03:07:49.720 align:start position:0%
to work and contribute to the economy
 
03:07:52.110 --> 03:07:52.120 align:start position:0%
but people need families to be healthy
 
03:07:55.269 --> 03:07:55.279 align:start position:0%
and happy which is their own right a
 
03:07:57.269 --> 03:07:57.279 align:start position:0%
current system forces a choice between
 
03:07:59.990 --> 03:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
these Alternatives and far too many of
 
03:08:02.670 --> 03:08:02.680 align:start position:0%
us of our most critical
 
03:08:05.910 --> 03:08:05.920 align:start position:0%
workers and as Co has shown incentivize
 
03:08:09.110 --> 03:08:09.120 align:start position:0%
employees to go to work so they can keep
 
03:08:10.469 --> 03:08:10.479 align:start position:0%
paying for their
 
03:08:13.190 --> 03:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
rent this conflict must be removed from
 
03:08:13.200 --> 03:08:15.349 align:start position:0%
rent this conflict must be removed from
the

03:08:15.349 --> 03:08:15.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:08:17.950 --> 03:08:17.960 align:start position:0%
system if we want safe and productive
 
03:08:20.830 --> 03:08:20.840 align:start position:0%
workers who are able to make choices
 
03:08:23.389 --> 03:08:23.399 align:start position:0%
consistent with public health
 
03:08:25.190 --> 03:08:25.200 align:start position:0%
additionally this issue
 
03:08:28.990 --> 03:08:29.000 align:start position:0%
disproportionately affects women such as
 
03:08:31.550 --> 03:08:31.560 align:start position:0%
myself that are often the primary
 
03:08:34.510 --> 03:08:34.520 align:start position:0%
caregivers within the family as a
 
03:08:36.469 --> 03:08:36.479 align:start position:0%
primary caregiver I've had to step away
 
03:08:39.110 --> 03:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
from promotions because of the need to
 
03:08:40.590 --> 03:08:40.600 align:start position:0%
make all of the appointments for my
 
03:08:43.030 --> 03:08:43.040 align:start position:0%
children and the negative attitudes that
 
03:08:44.990 --> 03:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
employers have when you're taking paid
 
03:08:46.870 --> 03:08:46.880 align:start position:0%
or unpaid leave or
 
03:08:49.030 --> 03:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
entitlements we need better systems in
 
03:08:50.630 --> 03:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
place to ensure that women can remain in
 
03:08:52.830 --> 03:08:52.840 align:start position:0%
the workplace especially during a
 
03:08:54.990 --> 03:08:55.000 align:start position:0%
pandemic and economic
 
03:08:59.070 --> 03:08:59.080 align:start position:0%
crisis else Bill 590 would help of note
 
03:09:01.229 --> 03:09:01.239 align:start position:0%
hearing some of today's testimonies from
 
03:09:03.429 --> 03:09:03.439 align:start position:0%
the companies opposing it appears they
 
03:09:05.870 --> 03:09:05.880 align:start position:0%
also reflect from male dominated labor
 
03:09:08.070 --> 03:09:08.080 align:start position:0%
markets and I would ask them what is
 
03:09:11.030 --> 03:09:11.040 align:start position:0%

been fascinating with fascinated with
 
03:10:36.469 --> 03:10:36.479 align:start position:0%
this process while I was waiting for
 
03:10:39.429 --> 03:10:39.439 align:start position:0%
things to come back I was again reading
 
03:10:41.030 --> 03:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
through the
 
03:10:45.630 --> 03:10:45.640 align:start position:0%
bill a few points Point came up
 
03:10:48.750 --> 03:10:48.760 align:start position:0%
outstandingly to me under the acral of
 
03:10:50.550 --> 03:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
paid sick time it
 
03:10:53.349 --> 03:10:53.359 align:start position:0%
says employees shall not acrw or use
 
03:10:56.790 --> 03:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
more than 72 hours of paid sick time in
 
03:10:59.630 --> 03:10:59.640 align:start position:0%
a calendar year unless the employer
 
03:11:02.110 --> 03:11:02.120 align:start position:0%
selects a higher
 
03:11:06.150 --> 03:11:06.160 align:start position:0%
limit with that limit I don't understand
 
03:11:08.150 --> 03:11:08.160 align:start position:0%
where the 8 days or all the other math
 
03:11:10.950 --> 03:11:10.960 align:start position:0%
comes from but I don't want to get an
 
03:11:14.229 --> 03:11:14.239 align:start position:0%
answer yet the people who have lived
 
03:11:17.229 --> 03:11:17.239 align:start position:0%
with this bill can answer that later I
 
03:11:18.389 --> 03:11:18.399 align:start position:0%
have a
 
03:11:22.349 --> 03:11:22.359 align:start position:0%
few key points first of all this bill is
 
03:11:25.910 --> 03:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
a good starting point it's part of the
 
03:11:25.920 --> 03:11:27.429 align:start position:0%
a good starting point it's part of the
entire

03:11:27.429 --> 03:11:27.439 align:start position:0%
entire
 
03:11:30.950 --> 03:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
Matrix of creating a family-friendly
 
03:11:32.790 --> 03:11:32.800 align:start position:0%
economy so that New Hampshire can
 
03:11:36.990 --> 03:11:37.000 align:start position:0%
attract and retain young people Working
 
03:11:40.910 --> 03:11:40.920 align:start position:0%
Families this is a little piece of
 
03:11:44.030 --> 03:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
that but it's a start having three days
 
03:11:48.150 --> 03:11:48.160 align:start position:0%
of sick time is just a start from my
 
03:11:50.790 --> 03:11:50.800 align:start position:0%
point of view as a small business
 
03:11:53.830 --> 03:11:53.840 align:start position:0%
owner I don't think it's
 
03:11:56.590 --> 03:11:56.600 align:start position:0%
unreasonable given enough time to work
 
03:11:59.550 --> 03:11:59.560 align:start position:0%
this into your business plan my husband
 
03:12:01.790 --> 03:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
and I are what some people might call
 
03:12:04.950 --> 03:12:04.960 align:start position:0%
Elders we're 73 and we're operating
 
03:12:04.960 --> 03:12:06.630 align:start position:0%
Elders we're 73 and we're operating
multiple

03:12:06.630 --> 03:12:06.640 align:start position:0%
multiple
 
03:12:09.429 --> 03:12:09.439 align:start position:0%
businesses but for all those years
 
03:12:12.229 --> 03:12:12.239 align:start position:0%
before we jumped ship on the corporate
 
03:12:12.239 --> 03:12:13.190 align:start position:0%
before we jumped ship on the corporate
life

03:12:13.190 --> 03:12:13.200 align:start position:0%
life
 
03:12:15.710 --> 03:12:15.720 align:start position:0%
we were employees I've had the
 
03:12:18.309 --> 03:12:18.319 align:start position:0%
experience of having a teenager have a
 
03:12:22.349 --> 03:12:22.359 align:start position:0%
mental health crisis and losing my job
 
03:12:24.670 --> 03:12:24.680 align:start position:0%
because I needed to go to
 
03:12:27.990 --> 03:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
appointments and family counseling
 
03:12:30.750 --> 03:12:30.760 align:start position:0%
appointments and it had to be both of us
 
03:12:32.630 --> 03:12:32.640 align:start position:0%
because we only had one
 
03:12:36.269 --> 03:12:36.279 align:start position:0%
car when I could not answer my boss as
 
03:12:38.349 --> 03:12:38.359 align:start position:0%
to how long is this going to go on with
 
03:12:42.830 --> 03:12:42.840 align:start position:0%
a specific amount of time he said then
 
03:12:44.710 --> 03:12:44.720 align:start position:0%
you have to I have to get someone else
 
03:12:48.429 --> 03:12:48.439 align:start position:0%
into your job there was no safety net
 
03:12:48.439 --> 03:12:49.590 align:start position:0%
into your job there was no safety net
for

03:12:49.590 --> 03:12:49.600 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:12:53.229 --> 03:12:53.239 align:start position:0%
that I've also had the experience of my
 
03:12:55.469 --> 03:12:55.479 align:start position:0%
granddaughter who at the time was about
 
03:12:59.830 --> 03:12:59.840 align:start position:0%
three a skinny little whippy child who
 
03:12:59.840 --> 03:13:01.229 align:start position:0%
three a skinny little whippy child who
almost

03:13:01.229 --> 03:13:01.239 align:start position:0%
almost
 
03:13:04.389 --> 03:13:04.399 align:start position:0%
died because an employee went to work at
 
03:13:05.910 --> 03:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
that Wendy's in
 
03:13:05.920 --> 03:13:08.349 align:start position:0%
that Wendy's in
Framingham

03:13:08.349 --> 03:13:08.359 align:start position:0%
Framingham
 
03:13:11.590 --> 03:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts with Sal manella which was
 
03:13:14.309 --> 03:13:14.319 align:start position:0%
misdiagnosed Miss diagnosed misdiagnosed
 
03:13:17.510 --> 03:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
as flu because the symptoms are quite
 
03:13:21.349 --> 03:13:21.359 align:start position:0%
different but that employee went to work
 
03:13:26.150 --> 03:13:26.160 align:start position:0%
sick and infected many many other people
 
03:13:30.990 --> 03:13:31.000 align:start position:0%
also but she was Tiny and she could have
 
03:13:34.150 --> 03:13:34.160 align:start position:0%
died I totally
 
03:13:34.160 --> 03:13:36.670 align:start position:0%
died I totally
agree

03:13:36.670 --> 03:13:36.680 align:start position:0%
agree
 
03:13:39.229 --> 03:13:39.239 align:start position:0%
with is it
 
03:13:43.750 --> 03:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
vanchu that paid time off is better
 
03:13:45.990 --> 03:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
if you have the resources you shouldn't
 
03:13:47.710 --> 03:13:47.720 align:start position:0%
have to lie and say you're sick because
 
03:13:50.150 --> 03:13:50.160 align:start position:0%
you want to do something else because
 
03:13:53.070 --> 03:13:53.080 align:start position:0%
you have to take someone else or take
 
03:13:55.830 --> 03:13:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:58.750 --> 03:13:58.760 align:start position:0%
else so paid time off is better but most
 
03:14:02.150 --> 03:14:02.160 align:start position:0%
small companies can't afford this
 
03:14:04.110 --> 03:14:04.120 align:start position:0%
looking at the language of the
 
03:14:07.229 --> 03:14:07.239 align:start position:0%
bill this is not requiring any company
 
03:14:11.469 --> 03:14:11.479 align:start position:0%
that has a superior plan to change
 
03:14:14.429 --> 03:14:14.439 align:start position:0%
it but it is being a little bit
 
03:14:18.110 --> 03:14:18.120 align:start position:0%
prescriptive about how sick time can be
 
03:14:24.190 --> 03:14:24.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:27.389 --> 03:14:27.399 align:start position:0%
to the description of
 
03:14:31.269 --> 03:14:31.279 align:start position:0%
it I was concerned that health
 
03:14:33.630 --> 03:14:33.640 align:start position:0%
professionals did not
 
03:14:36.510 --> 03:14:36.520 align:start position:0%
include Mental Health Counselors or
 
03:14:36.520 --> 03:14:38.070 align:start position:0%
include Mental Health Counselors or
Rehabilitation

03:14:38.070 --> 03:14:38.080 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation
 
03:14:40.389 --> 03:14:40.399 align:start position:0%
counselors they're not
 
03:14:43.190 --> 03:14:43.200 align:start position:0%
doctors they may be
 
03:14:46.309 --> 03:14:46.319 align:start position:0%
referred to from the doctors but you
 
03:14:49.469 --> 03:14:49.479 align:start position:0%
don't have to be a licensed Medical
 
03:14:53.710 --> 03:14:53.720 align:start position:0%
Professional to provide Mental Health
 
03:14:56.229 --> 03:14:56.239 align:start position:0%
Services if anything I would like to see
 
03:14:57.510 --> 03:14:57.520 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
03:14:59.349 --> 03:14:59.359 align:start position:0%
strengthened to
 
03:15:02.190 --> 03:15:02.200 align:start position:0%
include a little bit more in the
 
03:15:03.630 --> 03:15:03.640 align:start position:0%
definition of what a medical
 
03:15:07.190 --> 03:15:07.200 align:start position:0%
professional is I'd
 
03:15:09.389 --> 03:15:09.399 align:start position:0%
also love
 
03:15:15.269 --> 03:15:15.279 align:start position:0%
to have the idea of basic sick
 
03:15:18.630 --> 03:15:18.640 align:start position:0%
time that's not going to be enough but
 
03:15:22.229 --> 03:15:22.239 align:start position:0%
it's better than nothing the
 
03:15:25.910 --> 03:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
relationship between an employer and an
 
03:15:29.590 --> 03:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
employee should be based on trust
 
03:15:29.600 --> 03:15:31.309 align:start position:0%
employee should be based on trust
honesty

03:15:31.309 --> 03:15:31.319 align:start position:0%
honesty
 
03:15:35.910 --> 03:15:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:39.910 --> 03:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
compassion if you have to lie to
 
03:15:42.469 --> 03:15:42.479 align:start position:0%
somebody about why you're not at work
 
03:15:45.189 --> 03:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
work or if you can't take a day off to
 
03:15:47.070 --> 03:15:47.080 align:start position:0%
take care of yourself or someone
 
03:15:51.550 --> 03:15:51.560 align:start position:0%
else then it's hard to have that kind of
 
03:15:54.830 --> 03:15:54.840 align:start position:0%
trust I would love to have questions
 
03:15:54.840 --> 03:15:58.630 align:start position:0%
trust I would love to have questions
from

03:15:58.630 --> 03:15:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:01.870 --> 03:16:01.880 align:start position:0%
anyone I have my timer
 
03:16:03.670 --> 03:16:03.680 align:start position:0%
set thank
 
03:16:09.110 --> 03:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:11.630 --> 03:16:11.640 align:start position:0%
members thank you thank you for your
 
03:16:13.229 --> 03:16:13.239 align:start position:0%

03:16:13.239 --> 03:16:16.389 align:start position:0%
testimony have any questions of the
members

03:16:16.389 --> 03:16:16.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:18.830 --> 03:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
online no any question of the members
 
03:16:20.950 --> 03:16:20.960 align:start position:0%
here in the
 
03:16:24.229 --> 03:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
committee um since you ask since you'd
 
03:16:26.070 --> 03:16:26.080 align:start position:0%
like a question I have one for you on
 
03:16:27.950 --> 03:16:27.960 align:start position:0%
page two of the bill that you referred
 
03:16:30.710 --> 03:16:30.720 align:start position:0%
to employees shall not acue or use more
 
03:16:33.189 --> 03:16:33.199 align:start position:0%
than 72 hours of page six time account
 
03:16:35.790 --> 03:16:35.800 align:start position:0%
on page 2 on line
 
03:16:35.800 --> 03:16:39.349 align:start position:0%
on page 2 on line
21

03:16:39.349 --> 03:16:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:43.590 --> 03:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
um that is just for sick time
 
03:16:48.150 --> 03:16:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:50.550 --> 03:16:50.560 align:start position:0%
bill greatly exceed that for other
 
03:16:53.550 --> 03:16:53.560 align:start position:0%
mechanisms for other reasons I don't see
 
03:16:55.750 --> 03:16:55.760 align:start position:0%
anywhere I would love to have someone
 
03:16:58.189 --> 03:16:58.199 align:start position:0%
who is more familiar with the bill tell
 
03:17:01.389 --> 03:17:01.399 align:start position:0%
me where the numbers came from of more
 
03:17:04.189 --> 03:17:04.199 align:start position:0%
than three days that was my major
 
03:17:08.550 --> 03:17:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:11.189 --> 03:17:11.199 align:start position:0%
enough my numbers were lower than that
 
03:17:11.199 --> 03:17:13.030 align:start position:0%
enough my numbers were lower than that
so

03:17:13.030 --> 03:17:13.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:17:15.510 --> 03:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
so if you can't acrw more than 72 hours
 
03:17:21.469 --> 03:17:21.479 align:start position:0%
in a year that's pretty explicit 275 I
 
03:17:25.469 --> 03:17:25.479 align:start position:0%
two acrel of paid sick time number
 
03:17:28.309 --> 03:17:28.319 align:start position:0%
three I don't understand the I do
 
03:17:30.990 --> 03:17:31.000 align:start position:0%
understand the objection of the business
 
03:17:33.309 --> 03:17:33.319 align:start position:0%
Community to anyone telling them what to
 
03:17:36.670 --> 03:17:36.680 align:start position:0%
do most of the companies in Bia which I
 
03:17:39.469 --> 03:17:39.479 align:start position:0%
used to belong to and participate in are
 
03:17:43.389 --> 03:17:43.399 align:start position:0%
much larger than my companies
 
03:17:45.590 --> 03:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
this bill is not trying to address the
 
03:17:48.710 --> 03:17:48.720 align:start position:0%
companies's doing a good job this bill
 
03:17:50.469 --> 03:17:50.479 align:start position:0%
is trying to create some kind of a
 
03:17:54.389 --> 03:17:54.399 align:start position:0%
minimum safety net so that the people
 
03:17:56.150 --> 03:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
who are most
 
03:18:00.550 --> 03:18:00.560 align:start position:0%
disadvantaged have something at least
 
03:18:02.950 --> 03:18:02.960 align:start position:0%
something if you have the flu you should
 
03:18:05.750 --> 03:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
not be going to work for five days three
 
03:18:08.030 --> 03:18:08.040 align:start position:0%
sick days isn't going to cover it but
 
03:18:09.790 --> 03:18:09.800 align:start position:0%
it's better than nothing and it's a good
 
03:18:12.790 --> 03:18:12.800 align:start position:0%
start I'm really proud of the people who
 
03:18:16.349 --> 03:18:16.359 align:start position:0%
sponsored and crafted this Bill thank
 
03:18:20.590 --> 03:18:20.600 align:start position:0%

03:18:46.269 --> 03:18:46.279 align:start position:0%
we I support this bill and agree uh very
 
03:18:48.950 --> 03:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
much with uh representative wahner's
 
03:18:52.110 --> 03:18:52.120 align:start position:0%
assessment and reasoning uh behind the
 
03:18:55.590 --> 03:18:55.600 align:start position:0%
bill um so I want to add just a few
 
03:18:57.870 --> 03:18:57.880 align:start position:0%
points that haven't been brought up yet
 
03:18:59.790 --> 03:18:59.800 align:start position:0%
number one the the
 
03:19:02.349 --> 03:19:02.359 align:start position:0%
mechanics of whatever they may end up
 
03:19:04.309 --> 03:19:04.319 align:start position:0%
being of how
 
03:19:07.790 --> 03:19:07.800 align:start position:0%
to uh account for this is pretty
 
03:19:10.309 --> 03:19:10.319 align:start position:0%
standard stuff that uh if you use a
 
03:19:13.590 --> 03:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
payroll company or payroll software most
 
03:19:16.189 --> 03:19:16.199 align:start position:0%
of that uh most of the companies in the
 
03:19:17.870 --> 03:19:17.880 align:start position:0%
software can account for the
 
03:19:20.389 --> 03:19:20.399 align:start position:0%
accumulation of paid sick
 
03:19:23.910 --> 03:19:23.920 align:start position:0%
time um by the way I'm the executive
 
03:19:26.550 --> 03:19:26.560 align:start position:0%
director of white birch uh Center in
 
03:19:28.870 --> 03:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
hener we do child care school age
 
03:19:30.550 --> 03:19:30.560 align:start position:0%
programming and Senior
 
03:19:30.560 --> 03:19:32.389 align:start position:0%
programming and Senior
programming

03:19:32.389 --> 03:19:32.399 align:start position:0%
programming
 
03:19:35.309 --> 03:19:35.319 align:start position:0%
um there is definitely a cost to
 
03:19:37.910 --> 03:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
turnover of employees if an employee
 
03:19:41.790 --> 03:19:41.800 align:start position:0%
leaves um even if an employee is fired
 
03:19:44.790 --> 03:19:44.800 align:start position:0%
um my standard here when we lose an
 
03:19:47.670 --> 03:19:47.680 align:start position:0%
employee is 18 months before that
 
03:19:49.630 --> 03:19:49.640 align:start position:0%
employee feels completely comfortable
 
03:19:52.590 --> 03:19:52.600 align:start position:0%
with their job the workplace the culture
 
03:19:55.990 --> 03:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
and it's an expensive proposition to uh
 
03:19:58.349 --> 03:19:58.359 align:start position:0%
replace somebody and if somebody leaves
 
03:20:00.710 --> 03:20:00.720 align:start position:0%
because they don't have paid sick time
 
03:20:04.550 --> 03:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
um that cost far outweighs the 72 hours
 
03:20:06.710 --> 03:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
of sick time that they've acred in my
 
03:20:09.750 --> 03:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
opinion and finally we deal with a lot
 
03:20:12.750 --> 03:20:12.760 align:start position:0%
of clients who have to work they can't
 
03:20:15.670 --> 03:20:15.680 align:start position:0%
work from home and they drop their
 
03:20:17.670 --> 03:20:17.680 align:start position:0%
children off for child care and the
 
03:20:19.990 --> 03:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
number of times that we've had Parents
 
03:20:22.150 --> 03:20:22.160 align:start position:0%
approach us over the last seven years
 
03:20:26.030 --> 03:20:26.040 align:start position:0%
since I've been here to ask for us to
 
03:20:28.469 --> 03:20:28.479 align:start position:0%
provide free child care because they've
 
03:20:30.950 --> 03:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
lost their job for whatever reason and
 
03:20:32.630 --> 03:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
some people have lost their job because
 
03:20:35.269 --> 03:20:35.279 align:start position:0%
they've had to attend to a sick child
 
03:20:38.309 --> 03:20:38.319 align:start position:0%
it's uh it's a it's a memorable number
 
03:20:40.870 --> 03:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
it's not every day but uh it's
 
03:20:43.790 --> 03:20:43.800 align:start position:0%
definitely something that concerns me
 
03:20:46.469 --> 03:20:46.479 align:start position:0%
and also when they do lose their job and
 
03:20:48.510 --> 03:20:48.520 align:start position:0%
they have to go look for a job they need
 
03:20:53.189 --> 03:20:53.199 align:start position:0%
child care so for the employers who um
 
03:20:55.750 --> 03:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
are unable to provide sick leave and
 
03:20:58.309 --> 03:20:58.319 align:start position:0%
when somebody does have to work without
 
03:21:02.150 --> 03:21:02.160 align:start position:0%
pay or they're fired um the committee
 
03:21:04.070 --> 03:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
should understand that there's a cost to
 
03:21:06.590 --> 03:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
that to other businesses either
 
03:21:09.910 --> 03:21:09.920 align:start position:0%
utilities landlords or in our case uh
 
03:21:12.150 --> 03:21:12.160 align:start position:0%
child care where we want to help that
 
03:21:15.710 --> 03:21:15.720 align:start position:0%
family um as a nonprofit but uh we are
 
03:21:18.110 --> 03:21:18.120 align:start position:0%
absorbing a cost with that and that's uh
 
03:21:22.349 --> 03:21:22.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:28.670 --> 03:21:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:31.630 --> 03:21:31.640 align:start position:0%
speaker seeing none online any in the
 
03:21:31.640 --> 03:21:33.550 align:start position:0%
speaker seeing none online any in the
committee

03:21:33.550 --> 03:21:33.560 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:21:36.189 --> 03:21:36.199 align:start position:0%
room seeing none thank you very much for
 
03:21:39.349 --> 03:21:39.359 align:start position:0%
your testimony Mr chairman yes I'm sorry
 
03:21:40.990 --> 03:21:41.000 align:start position:0%
would it be out of order to provide a
 
03:21:42.349 --> 03:21:42.359 align:start position:0%
point of clarification
 
03:21:45.830 --> 03:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
on one of the prior questions and
 
03:21:48.950 --> 03:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
testimony um I don't think so what did
 
03:21:50.110 --> 03:21:50.120 align:start position:0%
you I don't understand what you're
 
03:21:52.590 --> 03:21:52.600 align:start position:0%
trying to do I just I the previous
 
03:21:55.150 --> 03:21:55.160 align:start position:0%
speaker to this one um there was some
 
03:21:57.510 --> 03:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
confusion around the math and hours and
 
03:21:59.070 --> 03:21:59.080 align:start position:0%
I just figured that out and wanted to
 
03:22:00.550 --> 03:22:00.560 align:start position:0%
take an opportunity to clarify in case
 
03:22:03.070 --> 03:22:03.080 align:start position:0%
anybody was confused I I will give you
 
03:22:04.550 --> 03:22:04.560 align:start position:0%
that Latitude go ahead representative
 
03:22:07.750 --> 03:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um so looking back
 
03:22:09.830 --> 03:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
at uh page two where we were talking
 
03:22:12.750 --> 03:22:12.760 align:start position:0%
about employees shall not acre or use
 
03:22:16.110 --> 03:22:16.120 align:start position:0%
more than 72 hours of paid sick time uh
 
03:22:17.910 --> 03:22:17.920 align:start position:0%
in a calendar year unless the employer
 
03:22:21.070 --> 03:22:21.080 align:start position:0%
sets a littleit higher so what I did was
 
03:22:26.469 --> 03:22:26.479 align:start position:0%
um started at the 280 Hour Week standard
 
03:22:30.990 --> 03:22:31.000 align:start position:0%
divided that by 30 it comes out to uh 69
 
03:22:34.670 --> 03:22:34.680 align:start position:0%
rounding up to 70 um so I think that's
 
03:22:36.750 --> 03:22:36.760 align:start position:0%
just the base standard to make the math
 
03:22:39.550 --> 03:22:39.560 align:start position:0%
work with the uh one hour of paid sick
 
03:22:41.550 --> 03:22:41.560 align:start position:0%
time for every 32 hours with a little
 
03:22:44.429 --> 03:22:44.439 align:start position:0%
bit a wiggle room uh just in case uh an
 
03:22:45.870 --> 03:22:45.880 align:start position:0%
employees clocked in for a little bit
 
03:22:48.189 --> 03:22:48.199 align:start position:0%
longer uh or something like that so that
 
03:22:50.550 --> 03:22:50.560 align:start position:0%
does add up in that regard yes I have
 
03:22:56.110 --> 03:22:56.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:00.990 --> 03:23:01.000 align:start position:0%
you oh trying to utilize um the 72 hours
 
03:23:03.429 --> 03:23:03.439 align:start position:0%
pay tick time that's allowed under this
 
03:23:08.309 --> 03:23:08.319 align:start position:0%
bill and um one hour ACR for every 30
 
03:23:12.790 --> 03:23:12.800 align:start position:0%
hours of of work which Loosely on it 20
 
03:23:14.830 --> 03:23:14.840 align:start position:0%
2 80
 
03:23:18.269 --> 03:23:18.279 align:start position:0%
hour year comes out to about
 
03:23:22.150 --> 03:23:22.160 align:start position:0%
29 you know 70 7 69 70 out it it's too
 
03:23:23.630 --> 03:23:23.640 align:start position:0%
short of
 
03:23:25.990 --> 03:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
72 we just trying to clarify the numbers
 
03:23:27.150 --> 03:23:27.160 align:start position:0%
since we were kind of throwing around
 
03:23:29.990 --> 03:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
some numbers so y appreciate that a lot
 
03:23:35.429 --> 03:23:35.439 align:start position:0%
going on here um like to call on uh
 
03:23:40.070 --> 03:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
retired Dr Randy Hayes followed by Molly
 
03:23:42.269 --> 03:23:42.279 align:start position:0%
Lun Owen
 
03:23:44.910 --> 03:23:44.920 align:start position:0%
Dr Hayes is a New Hampshire Medical
 
03:23:47.870 --> 03:23:47.880 align:start position:0%
Society and is in support of the bill Dr
 
03:23:50.750 --> 03:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
are you with us yes thank you Mr
 
03:23:53.790 --> 03:23:53.800 align:start position:0%
chairman can you hear me yes we can
 
03:23:56.950 --> 03:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
great um I appreciate the opportunity to
 
03:24:00.750 --> 03:24:00.760 align:start position:0%
speak uh to those online and the to the
 
03:24:00.760 --> 03:24:01.910 align:start position:0%
speak uh to those online and the to the
committee

03:24:01.910 --> 03:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:24:04.349 --> 03:24:04.359 align:start position:0%
specifically uh my name is Randy Hayes
 
03:24:06.750 --> 03:24:06.760 align:start position:0%
I'm a retired family doctor practiced in
 
03:24:10.550 --> 03:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
conquered for 35 years and during my
 
03:24:12.670 --> 03:24:12.680 align:start position:0%
years of medical practice practice I met
 
03:24:14.830 --> 03:24:14.840 align:start position:0%
hundreds of people who were unable to
 
03:24:16.870 --> 03:24:16.880 align:start position:0%
take proper care of their own and their
 
03:24:20.309 --> 03:24:20.319 align:start position:0%
fam's needs due to a lack of paid sick
 
03:24:24.070 --> 03:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
time I think representative walner spoke
 
03:24:29.189 --> 03:24:29.199 align:start position:0%
about uh the 33 some OD percent of the
 
03:24:31.110 --> 03:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
total Workforce in New Hampshire that
 
03:24:33.269 --> 03:24:33.279 align:start position:0%
currently does not have a single sick
 
03:24:37.189 --> 03:24:37.199 align:start position:0%
day that's paid available to them and I
 
03:24:39.189 --> 03:24:39.199 align:start position:0%
would submit that if you took that
 
03:24:41.110 --> 03:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
percentage and focused primarily on
 
03:24:44.269 --> 03:24:44.279 align:start position:0%
people known to be at high risk for such
 
03:24:46.830 --> 03:24:46.840 align:start position:0%
a lack of an essential benefit those
 
03:24:49.030 --> 03:24:49.040 align:start position:0%
being people of low income part-time
 
03:24:51.670 --> 03:24:51.680 align:start position:0%
workers people of color the
 
03:24:55.389 --> 03:24:55.399 align:start position:0%
uninsured um and new Americans not to
 
03:24:59.150 --> 03:24:59.160 align:start position:0%
mention the predominant women uh who um
 
03:25:01.429 --> 03:25:01.439 align:start position:0%
uh staff the workforce of Essential
 
03:25:04.110 --> 03:25:04.120 align:start position:0%
Medical uh providers in settings like
 
03:25:06.870 --> 03:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
home care and nursing home care you
 
03:25:09.510 --> 03:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
would get a much larger percentage of
 
03:25:11.830 --> 03:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
that portion of the workforce being
 
03:25:14.229 --> 03:25:14.239 align:start position:0%
deprived of a single day of paid sick
 
03:25:16.830 --> 03:25:16.840 align:start position:0%
time uh I go into a little more detail
 
03:25:18.990 --> 03:25:19.000 align:start position:0%
in my written testimony but let me just
 
03:25:22.590 --> 03:25:22.600 align:start position:0%
say that uh when these high-risk persons
 
03:25:25.309 --> 03:25:25.319 align:start position:0%
have to lose a day's pay in order to
 
03:25:27.790 --> 03:25:27.800 align:start position:0%
address an acute personal or family
 
03:25:31.349 --> 03:25:31.359 align:start position:0%
illness many Granite Staters now have to
 
03:25:34.030 --> 03:25:34.040 align:start position:0%
choose one of the following three
 
03:25:37.670 --> 03:25:37.680 align:start position:0%
harmful and lousy options one is to go
 
03:25:40.990 --> 03:25:41.000 align:start position:0%
to work sick and many uh speakers have
 
03:25:43.550 --> 03:25:43.560 align:start position:0%
already alluded to the risk of such
 
03:25:46.550 --> 03:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
Behavior not only to the employee but to
 
03:25:49.150 --> 03:25:49.160 align:start position:0%
the fellow employees and even to the
 
03:25:51.550 --> 03:25:51.560 align:start position:0%
employer as well as to the public
 
03:25:54.590 --> 03:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
especially during pandemic time the
 
03:25:57.429 --> 03:25:57.439 align:start position:0%
second poor option is to delay necessary
 
03:26:00.910 --> 03:26:00.920 align:start position:0%
care until the problem becomes so urgent
 
03:26:03.189 --> 03:26:03.199 align:start position:0%
that one has to resort to emergency room
 
03:26:05.750 --> 03:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
care for a worsening and more difficult
 
03:26:08.670 --> 03:26:08.680 align:start position:0%
to treat Progressive illness this is a
 
03:26:11.830 --> 03:26:11.840 align:start position:0%
very expensive proposition in terms of
 
03:26:14.710 --> 03:26:14.720 align:start position:0%
the finances of Health Care and also a
 
03:26:17.510 --> 03:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
very inferior choice of where to get the
 
03:26:20.870 --> 03:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
best care at the most opportune moment
 
03:26:25.389 --> 03:26:25.399 align:start position:0%
and the third uh very uh un uh un
 
03:26:28.910 --> 03:26:28.920 align:start position:0%
optional uh I'm sorry unoptimal choice
 
03:26:31.349 --> 03:26:31.359 align:start position:0%
is to delegate the care of a sick child
 
03:26:34.830 --> 03:26:34.840 align:start position:0%
or a disabled senior family member to a
 
03:26:37.469 --> 03:26:37.479 align:start position:0%
kind but ill-informed neighbor who can
 
03:26:40.030 --> 03:26:40.040 align:start position:0%
transport the patient to a health care
 
03:26:42.910 --> 03:26:42.920 align:start position:0%
professional for care this is an
 
03:26:45.550 --> 03:26:45.560 align:start position:0%
inferior choice because the neighbor
 
03:26:49.429 --> 03:26:49.439 align:start position:0%
cannot detail the essential information
 
03:26:53.150 --> 03:26:53.160 align:start position:0%
and provide the advocacy for such a sick
 
03:26:57.469 --> 03:26:57.479 align:start position:0%
family member um uh at a very important
 
03:27:01.030 --> 03:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
time uh we in medicine realize today
 
03:27:03.750 --> 03:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
that the family doctors have receded
 
03:27:06.389 --> 03:27:06.399 align:start position:0%
from the front lines of serious health
 
03:27:10.750 --> 03:27:10.760 align:start position:0%
care and um this is for obvious complex
 
03:27:13.710 --> 03:27:13.720 align:start position:0%
reasons but leads many people to have to
 
03:27:16.150 --> 03:27:16.160 align:start position:0%
deal with strangers when dealing with
 
03:27:18.830 --> 03:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
hospital or medical emergencies without
 
03:27:21.950 --> 03:27:21.960 align:start position:0%
the input of their family doctor and uh
 
03:27:25.189 --> 03:27:25.199 align:start position:0%
all the more reason to allow family
 
03:27:27.070 --> 03:27:27.080 align:start position:0%
advocates who are employed in the
 
03:27:30.550 --> 03:27:30.560 align:start position:0%
workforce to be able to take time at
 
03:27:33.950 --> 03:27:33.960 align:start position:0%
relatively short notice to do absolutely
 
03:27:36.269 --> 03:27:36.279 align:start position:0%
crucial advocacy for their family
 
03:27:39.030 --> 03:27:39.040 align:start position:0%
members so in conclusion I would say
 
03:27:42.590 --> 03:27:42.600 align:start position:0%
that paid ACR sick time reduces the
 
03:27:45.550 --> 03:27:45.560 align:start position:0%
financial and emotional pressures of to
 
03:27:48.990 --> 03:27:49.000 align:start position:0%
employees and employers during a time of
 
03:27:49.000 --> 03:27:50.309 align:start position:0%
employees and employers during a time of
urgent

03:27:50.309 --> 03:27:50.319 align:start position:0%
urgent
 
03:27:53.550 --> 03:27:53.560 align:start position:0%
illness I believe uh the assistance
 
03:27:56.670 --> 03:27:56.680 align:start position:0%
offered by this bill uh would not be
 
03:28:00.630 --> 03:28:00.640 align:start position:0%
inherently abused and contrary to some
 
03:28:03.830 --> 03:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
testimony would not be financially
 
03:28:07.229 --> 03:28:07.239 align:start position:0%
abusive though it be prescriptive uh to
 
03:28:10.030 --> 03:28:10.040 align:start position:0%
the smaller employers we've talked about
 
03:28:14.070 --> 03:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
today I believe HB 590 will contribute
 
03:28:17.150 --> 03:28:17.160 align:start position:0%
to a healthier Workforce and a more
 
03:28:19.910 --> 03:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
familyfriendly economy thank you and I'm
 
03:28:22.910 --> 03:28:22.920 align:start position:0%
very open to taking any
 
03:28:25.269 --> 03:28:25.279 align:start position:0%
questions thank you your testimony any
 
03:28:28.790 --> 03:28:28.800 align:start position:0%

03:29:03.550 --> 03:29:03.560 align:start position:0%
technology situation I really
 
03:29:06.550 --> 03:29:06.560 align:start position:0%
appreciated that um I am writing in
 
03:29:10.269 --> 03:29:10.279 align:start position:0%
support of HB 590 I'm a new mom to a
 
03:29:12.150 --> 03:29:12.160 align:start position:0%
really chubby and Happ 9-month-old who
 
03:29:13.670 --> 03:29:13.680 align:start position:0%
thankfully is sleeping in the room next
 
03:29:15.110 --> 03:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
door so you shouldn't hear too much
 
03:29:18.030 --> 03:29:18.040 align:start position:0%
noise from her during this testimony um
 
03:29:20.550 --> 03:29:20.560 align:start position:0%
my husband is an engineer and a navy
 
03:29:23.070 --> 03:29:23.080 align:start position:0%
reservist and he's preparing to deploy
 
03:29:24.910 --> 03:29:24.920 align:start position:0%
to the Middle East for 10 months
 
03:29:26.469 --> 03:29:26.479 align:start position:0%
starting this
 
03:29:29.349 --> 03:29:29.359 align:start position:0%
spring so with all due respect to the
 
03:29:32.269 --> 03:29:32.279 align:start position:0%
business owners who spoke um before me a
 
03:29:34.790 --> 03:29:34.800 align:start position:0%
general PTO might work for a large
 
03:29:36.950 --> 03:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
company a construction company or a
 
03:29:39.910 --> 03:29:39.920 align:start position:0%
manufacturing company but I've worked in
 
03:29:42.030 --> 03:29:42.040 align:start position:0%
nonprofits my whole life and the reality
 
03:29:42.040 --> 03:29:42.750 align:start position:0%
nonprofits my whole life and the reality
is

03:29:42.750 --> 03:29:42.760 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:29:45.389 --> 03:29:45.399 align:start position:0%
that the one I most recently worked for
 
03:29:47.309 --> 03:29:47.319 align:start position:0%
could not afford to maintain a
 
03:29:50.349 --> 03:29:50.359 align:start position:0%
short-term disability policy and so we
 
03:29:53.590 --> 03:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
had two weeks of of sick time and
 
03:29:56.550 --> 03:29:56.560 align:start position:0%
disability that or excuse me sick time
 
03:29:59.150 --> 03:29:59.160 align:start position:0%
and paid leave we could use our
 
03:30:01.469 --> 03:30:01.479 align:start position:0%
discretion throughout the year um I was
 
03:30:03.189 --> 03:30:03.199 align:start position:0%
almost hospitalized with the flu last
 
03:30:04.830 --> 03:30:04.840 align:start position:0%
spring and I missed almost two weeks of
 
03:30:07.670 --> 03:30:07.680 align:start position:0%
work was pre-co and I was pregnant and
 
03:30:09.309 --> 03:30:09.319 align:start position:0%
in my previous job had I been working
 
03:30:10.510 --> 03:30:10.520 align:start position:0%
there I that would have been the
 
03:30:12.349 --> 03:30:12.359 align:start position:0%
entirety of my paid leave so I would
 
03:30:16.670 --> 03:30:16.680 align:start position:0%
have returned from from sick leave to
 
03:30:19.229 --> 03:30:19.239 align:start position:0%
have no maternity leave and also no
 
03:30:20.950 --> 03:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
leave for doctor's appointments for
 
03:30:23.790 --> 03:30:23.800 align:start position:0%
myself or for my new baby and also no
 
03:30:25.710 --> 03:30:25.720 align:start position:0%
time to be with my husband before or
 
03:30:29.269 --> 03:30:29.279 align:start position:0%
after his deployment and thankfully I
 
03:30:31.150 --> 03:30:31.160 align:start position:0%
run my current organization so we do
 
03:30:32.670 --> 03:30:32.680 align:start position:0%
offer paid sick
 
03:30:35.510 --> 03:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
leave but most military spouses in New
 
03:30:38.389 --> 03:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and at least a third of
 
03:30:40.030 --> 03:30:40.040 align:start position:0%
families who are single parent families
 
03:30:44.269 --> 03:30:44.279 align:start position:0%
don't have a second parent available um
 
03:30:46.870 --> 03:30:46.880 align:start position:0%
in fact their their you know their
 
03:30:48.870 --> 03:30:48.880 align:start position:0%
partner is basically on deployment
 
03:30:51.030 --> 03:30:51.040 align:start position:0%
permanently because it's just them and
 
03:30:53.630 --> 03:30:53.640 align:start position:0%
it's it's really not fair for working
 
03:30:55.309 --> 03:30:55.319 align:start position:0%
moms specifically working parents in
 
03:30:58.309 --> 03:30:58.319 align:start position:0%
general to have to choose their families
 
03:31:00.750 --> 03:31:00.760 align:start position:0%
and their work because I want to work I
 
03:31:02.229 --> 03:31:02.239 align:start position:0%
want to contribute to the economy in New
 
03:31:04.189 --> 03:31:04.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I don't want to drop out of
 
03:31:06.269 --> 03:31:06.279 align:start position:0%
the workforce because the work I do is
 
03:31:08.950 --> 03:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
important to me and I urge you to the
 
03:31:11.150 --> 03:31:11.160 align:start position:0%
views of those who spoke before me and
 
03:31:15.030 --> 03:31:15.040 align:start position:0%

03:32:39.189 --> 03:32:39.199 align:start position:0%

03:32:40.990 --> 03:32:41.000 align:start position:0%

air

03:33:01.630 --> 03:33:01.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:07.309 --> 03:33:07.319 align:start position:0%

03:33:09.349 --> 03:33:09.359 align:start position:0%
some complicated I was on my phone it's
 
03:33:12.389 --> 03:33:12.399 align:start position:0%
okay so um um my name is Rosie Garvey
 
03:33:16.189 --> 03:33:16.199 align:start position:0%
and I'm from Amherst and um as I said
 
03:33:18.349 --> 03:33:18.359 align:start position:0%
before I have two chronic illnesses I
 
03:33:20.429 --> 03:33:20.439 align:start position:0%
assist six fiis and I have rheumatoid
 
03:33:22.910 --> 03:33:22.920 align:start position:0%
arthritis and that's why I am in support
 
03:33:25.910 --> 03:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
of today's sick Le bill um right now I'm
 
03:33:27.950 --> 03:33:27.960 align:start position:0%
a full-time college student but I also
 
03:33:30.070 --> 03:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
work in retail part-time and while I
 
03:33:32.110 --> 03:33:32.120 align:start position:0%
have really accommodating managers that
 
03:33:34.790 --> 03:33:34.800 align:start position:0%
still means whenever I'm sick I miss a
 
03:33:37.790 --> 03:33:37.800 align:start position:0%
whole day worth of pay um I'm lucky
 
03:33:39.790 --> 03:33:39.800 align:start position:0%
currently to live with my parents so
 
03:33:41.469 --> 03:33:41.479 align:start position:0%
that minimizes the stress of having to
 
03:33:43.389 --> 03:33:43.399 align:start position:0%
miss a paycheck but I'm going to be
 
03:33:46.110 --> 03:33:46.120 align:start position:0%
graduating college in May and when that
 
03:33:47.590 --> 03:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
does happen and I have to enter the
 
03:33:50.070 --> 03:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
workforce truly I'm nervous about being
 
03:33:52.910 --> 03:33:52.920 align:start position:0%
a chronically ill person in the
 
03:33:56.150 --> 03:33:56.160 align:start position:0%
workforce um in 2020 alone I had to be
 
03:33:58.389 --> 03:33:58.399 align:start position:0%
hospitalized three times all for over
 
03:34:00.750 --> 03:34:00.760 align:start position:0%
three days and had countless sick days
 
03:34:02.710 --> 03:34:02.720 align:start position:0%
from work in school and that was a
 
03:34:05.710 --> 03:34:05.720 align:start position:0%
considerably healthy year for me when
 
03:34:07.630 --> 03:34:07.640 align:start position:0%
symptoms of my illnesses pop up at
 
03:34:09.990 --> 03:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
random and without warning I wake up and
 
03:34:11.790 --> 03:34:11.800 align:start position:0%
I don't get to choose whether or not to
 
03:34:14.349 --> 03:34:14.359 align:start position:0%
go to work I'm often in too much pain to
 
03:34:16.110 --> 03:34:16.120 align:start position:0%
get out of bed or have to immediately
 
03:34:18.429 --> 03:34:18.439 align:start position:0%
call my doctor and get to the
 
03:34:21.030 --> 03:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
hospital if paid sick lead were required
 
03:34:23.150 --> 03:34:23.160 align:start position:0%
by the state on days where I'm so unwell
 
03:34:24.990 --> 03:34:25.000 align:start position:0%
that I cannot work I would be able to
 
03:34:26.510 --> 03:34:26.520 align:start position:0%
focus on getting better and not on
 
03:34:28.910 --> 03:34:28.920 align:start position:0%
missing a paycheck it's not whether or
 
03:34:32.229 --> 03:34:32.239 align:start position:0%
not I'm like willing to go to work sick
 
03:34:34.309 --> 03:34:34.319 align:start position:0%
I'm physically unable to go to work sick
 
03:34:36.670 --> 03:34:36.680 align:start position:0%
so I either lose the paycheck or I get
 
03:34:39.590 --> 03:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
paid um my medical conditions cost me
 
03:34:41.269 --> 03:34:41.279 align:start position:0%
enough in term of hot in terms of
 
03:34:43.269 --> 03:34:43.279 align:start position:0%
hospital bills prescriptions and other
 
03:34:46.030 --> 03:34:46.040 align:start position:0%
unexpected costs so the possibility of
 
03:34:47.910 --> 03:34:47.920 align:start position:0%
not getting paid for days I am sick just
 
03:34:49.550 --> 03:34:49.560 align:start position:0%
adds to that Financial
 
03:34:52.269 --> 03:34:52.279 align:start position:0%
strain um I also know that I'm just one
 
03:34:53.910 --> 03:34:53.920 align:start position:0%
story of a New Hampshire citizen who
 
03:34:56.110 --> 03:34:56.120 align:start position:0%
would be very positively impacted by
 
03:34:58.349 --> 03:34:58.359 align:start position:0%
this bill I hope you'll consider those
 
03:35:00.389 --> 03:35:00.399 align:start position:0%
of us who want the opportunity to be
 
03:35:02.510 --> 03:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
successful in the workforce and don't
 
03:35:04.309 --> 03:35:04.319 align:start position:0%
deserve to be punished financially for
 
03:35:07.309 --> 03:35:07.319 align:start position:0%
the unfair hand we've been dealt and I
 
03:35:08.550 --> 03:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
hope you'll consider that while making
 
03:35:12.309 --> 03:35:12.319 align:start position:0%
your decision thank you so much
 
03:35:15.510 --> 03:35:15.520 align:start position:0%
thank you um so my mom also signed up to
 
03:35:17.990 --> 03:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
speak she just let me jump on would it
 
03:35:21.389 --> 03:35:21.399 align:start position:0%
be okay if she spoke as well um yes but
 
03:35:23.309 --> 03:35:23.319 align:start position:0%
would you please hold online because
 
03:35:24.309 --> 03:35:24.319 align:start position:0%
we're going to ask if there's any
 
03:35:27.189 --> 03:35:27.199 align:start position:0%
questions about your testimony perfect
 
03:35:32.349 --> 03:35:32.359 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions online for the
 
03:35:36.429 --> 03:35:36.439 align:start position:0%
speaker not any in the hearing
 
03:35:38.990 --> 03:35:39.000 align:start position:0%

Paula
 
03:35:47.110 --> 03:35:47.120 align:start position:0%
G good morning good afternoon um thank
 
03:35:49.030 --> 03:35:49.040 align:start position:0%
you for allowing me to hop on to this
 
03:35:51.189 --> 03:35:51.199 align:start position:0%
call I will be very brief H I think
 
03:35:55.349 --> 03:35:55.359 align:start position:0%
Rosie's story um probably probably gives
 
03:35:58.150 --> 03:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
a a better feel for this bill than than
 
03:36:00.830 --> 03:36:00.840 align:start position:0%
me so my name is Paula Garvey I live in
 
03:36:02.590 --> 03:36:02.600 align:start position:0%
Amherst New Hampshire and I support this
 
03:36:05.070 --> 03:36:05.080 align:start position:0%
bill to ensure access to paage sick Le
 
03:36:07.590 --> 03:36:07.600 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire as you know my daughter
 
03:36:10.189 --> 03:36:10.199 align:start position:0%
Rosie was born with cystic fibrosis and
 
03:36:11.710 --> 03:36:11.720 align:start position:0%
this is chronic health condition that
 
03:36:15.150 --> 03:36:15.160 align:start position:0%
affects the lungs and many other organs
 
03:36:17.389 --> 03:36:17.399 align:start position:0%
CF requires a lot of Medical Care
 
03:36:19.469 --> 03:36:19.479 align:start position:0%
frequent do doctors visits and
 
03:36:19.479 --> 03:36:21.309 align:start position:0%
frequent do doctors visits and
unfortunately

03:36:21.309 --> 03:36:21.319 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
03:36:23.790 --> 03:36:23.800 align:start position:0%
hospitalizations um at the age of 15
 
03:36:26.110 --> 03:36:26.120 align:start position:0%
Rosie was also diagnosed with rheumatoid
 
03:36:28.750 --> 03:36:28.760 align:start position:0%
arthritis which had a huge impact on her
 
03:36:31.070 --> 03:36:31.080 align:start position:0%
health both conditions have led to
 
03:36:33.389 --> 03:36:33.399 align:start position:0%
multiple hospitalizations and
 
03:36:36.070 --> 03:36:36.080 align:start position:0%
surgeries and honestly it has been very
 
03:36:38.630 --> 03:36:38.640 align:start position:0%
challenging as a family to work and to
 
03:36:41.030 --> 03:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
care for a child with health
 
03:36:43.670 --> 03:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
conditions um in the past when Rosie was
 
03:36:45.830 --> 03:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
hospitalized I was fortunate to have 4
 
03:36:49.030 --> 03:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
days paid leave but after that I would
 
03:36:51.389 --> 03:36:51.399 align:start position:0%
have to use unpaid leave this was
 
03:36:54.349 --> 03:36:54.359 align:start position:0%
particularly stressful um for me my
 
03:36:56.870 --> 03:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
husband and I used to juggle our sick
 
03:36:59.070 --> 03:36:59.080 align:start position:0%
days to ensure one parent was available
 
03:37:01.630 --> 03:37:01.640 align:start position:0%
on one occasion my older daughter uh who
 
03:37:03.469 --> 03:37:03.479 align:start position:0%
lives in New York came home to support
 
03:37:06.309 --> 03:37:06.319 align:start position:0%
us when Ros was hospitalized because we
 
03:37:09.710 --> 03:37:09.720 align:start position:0%
used our sick days I cannot uh for a
 
03:37:09.720 --> 03:37:10.950 align:start position:0%
used our sick days I cannot uh for a
moment

03:37:10.950 --> 03:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
moment
 
03:37:14.070 --> 03:37:14.080 align:start position:0%
understand or be able to put myself in a
 
03:37:18.189 --> 03:37:18.199 align:start position:0%
position where I had no paid sickly days
 
03:37:19.950 --> 03:37:19.960 align:start position:0%
uh parents with children of chronic
 
03:37:21.550 --> 03:37:21.560 align:start position:0%
health conditions have to attend
 
03:37:23.590 --> 03:37:23.600 align:start position:0%
multiple appointments when Rosie is
 
03:37:26.110 --> 03:37:26.120 align:start position:0%
healthy she is Clinic every three months
 
03:37:28.030 --> 03:37:28.040 align:start position:0%
um often with appointments between
 
03:37:31.790 --> 03:37:31.800 align:start position:0%
clinic visits also Rosie is 22 now so
 
03:37:35.030 --> 03:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
she is independent but H in the past and
 
03:37:36.910 --> 03:37:36.920 align:start position:0%
I know there are many other families who
 
03:37:40.030 --> 03:37:40.040 align:start position:0%
really struggle to juggle uh working and
 
03:37:41.790 --> 03:37:41.800 align:start position:0%
having a child with a chronic health
 
03:37:43.590 --> 03:37:43.600 align:start position:0%
condition is very very difficult to
 
03:37:46.429 --> 03:37:46.439 align:start position:0%
manage work and sick days at time and
 
03:37:48.830 --> 03:37:48.840 align:start position:0%
then lastly can I just add that on a
 
03:37:51.070 --> 03:37:51.080 align:start position:0%
general note um and as pandemic has
 
03:37:53.670 --> 03:37:53.680 align:start position:0%
thought it it is imperative to stay at
 
03:37:55.950 --> 03:37:55.960 align:start position:0%
home and feeling unw so as not to spread
 
03:37:58.030 --> 03:37:58.040 align:start position:0%
infection I used to work in the school
 
03:38:01.550 --> 03:38:01.560 align:start position:0%
system and was exposed to to many
 
03:38:05.269 --> 03:38:05.279 align:start position:0%
viruses germs but H and I know how I
 
03:38:07.189 --> 03:38:07.199 align:start position:0%
know the impact it can have and we all
 
03:38:09.229 --> 03:38:09.239 align:start position:0%
know at this stage um knowing that
 
03:38:11.309 --> 03:38:11.319 align:start position:0%
people have a cushion of some pay I
 
03:38:12.990 --> 03:38:13.000 align:start position:0%
think would make it easier for us to
 
03:38:15.870 --> 03:38:15.880 align:start position:0%
make the the right decision uh thank you
 
03:38:18.590 --> 03:38:18.600 align:start position:0%
for for allowing me to to hop in like
 
03:38:20.389 --> 03:38:20.399 align:start position:0%
this and if you have any questions I
 
03:38:24.550 --> 03:38:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:29.189 --> 03:38:29.199 align:start position:0%
answer okay any questions for the
 
03:38:32.229 --> 03:38:32.239 align:start position:0%

speaker I'm sorry I didn't catch
 
03:38:56.040 --> 03:38:57.630 align:start position:0%

03:39:08.670 --> 03:39:08.680 align:start position:0%
lmer Christina do we have anyone else in
 
03:39:10.830 --> 03:39:10.840 align:start position:0%
the queue waiting to speak
 
03:39:12.590 --> 03:39:12.600 align:start position:0%
um we do have a few people that signed
 
03:39:15.309 --> 03:39:15.319 align:start position:0%
up after um you were delivered your
 
03:39:17.550 --> 03:39:17.560 align:start position:0%
sheet and many of them have their hands
 
03:39:19.229 --> 03:39:19.239 align:start position:0%
raised so it looks like we have about
 
03:39:21.990 --> 03:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
five folks who are looking to speak in
 
03:39:26.830 --> 03:39:26.840 align:start position:0%
addition okay please since
 
03:39:36.110 --> 03:39:36.120 align:start position:0%

okay Kristen uh you are you are
 
03:39:41.030 --> 03:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
recognized to speak
 
03:39:43.070 --> 03:39:43.080 align:start position:0%
thank you it just took me a minute to
 
03:39:46.389 --> 03:39:46.399 align:start position:0%
unmute um so I am a professor at
 
03:39:49.670 --> 03:39:49.680 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth uh College um but I used to be
 
03:39:53.110 --> 03:39:53.120 align:start position:0%
at the Cary school um at UNH and when I
 
03:39:57.510 --> 03:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
was there I uh conducted analysis and
 
03:39:59.870 --> 03:39:59.880 align:start position:0%
and uh fielded a study on the gr State
 
03:40:02.349 --> 03:40:02.359 align:start position:0%
poll and asked some questions this was
 
03:40:02.359 --> 03:40:03.389 align:start position:0%
poll and asked some questions this was
in

03:40:03.389 --> 03:40:03.399 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:40:07.030 --> 03:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
2018 about um I asked questions of
 
03:40:09.790 --> 03:40:09.800 align:start position:0%
workers in New Hampshire whether or not
 
03:40:11.710 --> 03:40:11.720 align:start position:0%
they had paid sck days from their
 
03:40:14.830 --> 03:40:14.840 align:start position:0%
employer and so I provided uh written
 
03:40:17.830 --> 03:40:17.840 align:start position:0%
testimony last night um but I was
 
03:40:19.910 --> 03:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
teaching so I didn't know today I taught
 
03:40:22.229 --> 03:40:22.239 align:start position:0%
so I didn't know if I would make it in
 
03:40:25.910 --> 03:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
uh in time to provide any written uh any
 
03:40:28.309 --> 03:40:28.319 align:start position:0%
um oral testimony so I just want to draw
 
03:40:31.990 --> 03:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
your attention to the
 
03:40:34.870 --> 03:40:34.880 align:start position:0%
um the testimony that I provided in a
 
03:40:38.469 --> 03:40:38.479 align:start position:0%
written form um and basically I analyzed
 
03:40:41.349 --> 03:40:41.359 align:start position:0%
the granite state poll data from 2018
 
03:40:44.790 --> 03:40:44.800 align:start position:0%
and looked at um the percent of uh New
 
03:40:46.710 --> 03:40:46.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire workers who lack access to
 
03:40:49.070 --> 03:40:49.080 align:start position:0%
paid six sick days so in
 
03:40:52.950 --> 03:40:52.960 align:start position:0%
2018 uh 32% of New Hampshire New
 
03:40:56.269 --> 03:40:56.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire workers lacked access and I um
 
03:40:59.110 --> 03:40:59.120 align:start position:0%
analyze the data looking at where some
 
03:41:01.910 --> 03:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
discrepancies lied in terms of those who
 
03:41:04.229 --> 03:41:04.239 align:start position:0%
have access and those who don't and you
 
03:41:06.590 --> 03:41:06.600 align:start position:0%
can see that in table one in my uh
 
03:41:11.269 --> 03:41:11.279 align:start position:0%
written testimony and so um workers who
 
03:41:15.349 --> 03:41:15.359 align:start position:0%
work part-time are much more likely to
 
03:41:18.229 --> 03:41:18.239 align:start position:0%
lack access than those who work
 
03:41:20.790 --> 03:41:20.800 align:start position:0%
full-time um this you know isn't
 
03:41:25.990 --> 03:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
surprising because uh a lot of our um a
 
03:41:27.670 --> 03:41:27.680 align:start position:0%
lot of our workplace standards are
 
03:41:30.510 --> 03:41:30.520 align:start position:0%
guaranteed for um you know it's it's
 
03:41:32.870 --> 03:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
tied to full-time employment but we do
 
03:41:34.590 --> 03:41:34.600 align:start position:0%
have workplace standards that are
 
03:41:37.269 --> 03:41:37.279 align:start position:0%
guaranteed for all workers regardless of
 
03:41:39.030 --> 03:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
their work hours such as the minimum
 
03:41:43.030 --> 03:41:43.040 align:start position:0%
wage and safety codes um the other uh
 
03:41:46.030 --> 03:41:46.040 align:start position:0%
group that often um doesn't have paid
 
03:41:48.469 --> 03:41:48.479 align:start position:0%
sick days are those that are lowincome
 
03:41:51.870 --> 03:41:51.880 align:start position:0%
workers um so 46% of those in the
 
03:41:55.030 --> 03:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
workforce that are earning $600 per week
 
03:41:58.790 --> 03:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
or less lack paid sick days and that
 
03:42:03.269 --> 03:42:03.279 align:start position:0%
compares to only 18% that lack access um
 
03:42:06.389 --> 03:42:06.399 align:start position:0%
among those who are earning more than
 
03:42:09.189 --> 03:42:09.199 align:start position:0%
1,600 um per week so we see this large
 
03:42:09.199 --> 03:42:10.750 align:start position:0%
1,600 um per week so we see this large
discrepancy

03:42:10.750 --> 03:42:10.760 align:start position:0%
discrepancy
 
03:42:14.110 --> 03:42:14.120 align:start position:0%
um in access to paid sick time based on
 
03:42:19.710 --> 03:42:19.720 align:start position:0%
your earnings um women who have um been
 
03:42:21.950 --> 03:42:21.960 align:start position:0%
called upon during this pandemic to
 
03:42:26.110 --> 03:42:26.120 align:start position:0%
provide so much of the caregiving
 
03:42:31.670 --> 03:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
um 30 um 32% I think it was yeah no 30
 
03:42:36.309 --> 03:42:36.319 align:start position:0%
34% lack access to um to PID sick days
 
03:42:38.389 --> 03:42:38.399 align:start position:0%
through their employer um and this
 
03:42:40.469 --> 03:42:40.479 align:start position:0%
potentially compromises the health and
 
03:42:42.990 --> 03:42:43.000 align:start position:0%
economic well-being of families so in
 
03:42:45.070 --> 03:42:45.080 align:start position:0%
September I'll just draw your attention
 
03:42:49.590 --> 03:42:49.600 align:start position:0%
to um the mass amount of women who left
 
03:42:52.550 --> 03:42:52.560 align:start position:0%
the labor force in September of 20 2020
 
03:42:53.790 --> 03:42:53.800 align:start position:0%
that was
 
03:42:53.800 --> 03:42:55.349 align:start position:0%
that was
865,000

03:42:55.349 --> 03:42:55.359 align:start position:0%
865,000
 
03:42:59.149 --> 03:42:59.159 align:start position:0%
workers across the United States um were
 
03:43:01.149 --> 03:43:01.159 align:start position:0%
women who were leaving the labor force
 
03:43:04.710 --> 03:43:04.720 align:start position:0%
and some of that um one could argue has
 
03:43:07.070 --> 03:43:07.080 align:start position:0%
to do with the lack of work supports
 
03:43:09.189 --> 03:43:09.199 align:start position:0%
such as paid sick days or Paid Family
 
03:43:13.590 --> 03:43:13.600 align:start position:0%
Leave um or other as aspects as well
 
03:43:18.269 --> 03:43:18.279 align:start position:0%
um and then finally workers who um are
 
03:43:21.149 --> 03:43:21.159 align:start position:0%
employed in firms with fewer than 50
 
03:43:25.349 --> 03:43:25.359 align:start position:0%
employees um also lack access to paid
 
03:43:27.950 --> 03:43:27.960 align:start position:0%
stick time compared to those that work
 
03:43:32.590 --> 03:43:32.600 align:start position:0%
in larger firms um 52% of those that are
 
03:43:35.229 --> 03:43:35.239 align:start position:0%
in those smaller firms and as you all
 
03:43:37.229 --> 03:43:37.239 align:start position:0%
know small firms are the engine of the
 
03:43:40.750 --> 03:43:40.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire economy in 2015 40% of
 
03:43:43.189 --> 03:43:43.199 align:start position:0%
workers uh were employed in these
 
03:43:46.670 --> 03:43:46.680 align:start position:0%
smaller firms um so I just wanted to
 
03:43:50.189 --> 03:43:50.199 align:start position:0%
draw your attention to some of the data
 
03:43:53.910 --> 03:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
um you know I know that employers um you
 
03:43:58.070 --> 03:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
know are providing paid sick time but um
 
03:43:59.790 --> 03:43:59.800 align:start position:0%
we still have this
 
03:44:03.710 --> 03:44:03.720 align:start position:0%
uneven um access in our state um
 
03:44:06.550 --> 03:44:06.560 align:start position:0%
depending on you know where you work how
 
03:44:11.110 --> 03:44:11.120 align:start position:0%
much you earn um and this uh this bill
 
03:44:13.510 --> 03:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
could help address some of those
 
03:44:16.550 --> 03:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
inequalities happy to take any
 
03:44:18.670 --> 03:44:18.680 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Miss Smith any
 
03:44:20.710 --> 03:44:20.720 align:start position:0%
questions here in the committee
 
03:44:25.750 --> 03:44:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:28.110 --> 03:44:28.120 align:start position:0%
online say none thank you very much for

and my first name is Addie I'm so sorry
 
03:44:54.349 --> 03:44:54.359 align:start position:0%
no it's okay common mistake so and I'm
 
03:44:56.630 --> 03:44:56.640 align:start position:0%
actually talking to you from um
 
03:44:58.550 --> 03:44:58.560 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth Hitchcock I'm in our
 
03:44:58.560 --> 03:44:59.670 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth Hitchcock I'm in our
pediatric

03:44:59.670 --> 03:44:59.680 align:start position:0%
pediatric
 
03:45:03.149 --> 03:45:03.159 align:start position:0%
ICU and um because of that and because
 
03:45:05.910 --> 03:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
I'm also a mom and a human being in this
 
03:45:08.990 --> 03:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
time in our life I'm very familiar with
 
03:45:13.469 --> 03:45:13.479 align:start position:0%
the need for paid sick leave um and I
 
03:45:16.750 --> 03:45:16.760 align:start position:0%
just want to eluate that we just went
 
03:45:18.550 --> 03:45:18.560 align:start position:0%
through this large pandemic which we're
 
03:45:21.349 --> 03:45:21.359 align:start position:0%
still struggling with that um sometimes
 
03:45:23.389 --> 03:45:23.399 align:start position:0%
can be called the great equalizer but I
 
03:45:25.269 --> 03:45:25.279 align:start position:0%
think also what we're faced with is that
 
03:45:28.550 --> 03:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
it is um has been a great revealer of a
 
03:45:30.309 --> 03:45:30.319 align:start position:0%
lot of our healthc care
 
03:45:32.710 --> 03:45:32.720 align:start position:0%
disparities and um and it's an
 
03:45:35.790 --> 03:45:35.800 align:start position:0%
opportunity for us to work towards
 
03:45:38.349 --> 03:45:38.359 align:start position:0%
rectifying some of those and paid sick
 
03:45:40.830 --> 03:45:40.840 align:start position:0%
leave is one way to do that
 
03:45:43.750 --> 03:45:43.760 align:start position:0%
I think um and I think moving forward
 
03:45:45.750 --> 03:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
and also representing the New Hampshire
 
03:45:49.110 --> 03:45:49.120 align:start position:0%
Medical Society today it's important for
 
03:45:51.990 --> 03:45:52.000 align:start position:0%
everybody to know that the data driven
 
03:45:53.750 --> 03:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
approach to this is that actually it
 
03:45:55.469 --> 03:45:55.479 align:start position:0%
doesn't cost businesses more and it
 
03:45:59.110 --> 03:45:59.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't put businesses out of um out of
 
03:46:01.510 --> 03:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
business it tends to actually save them
 
03:46:05.590 --> 03:46:05.600 align:start position:0%
money in the long run and um and it's
 
03:46:08.189 --> 03:46:08.199 align:start position:0%
been an argument against paid sickly for
 
03:46:10.630 --> 03:46:10.640 align:start position:0%
a long long time both at the national
 
03:46:13.550 --> 03:46:13.560 align:start position:0%
and state level but the numbers actually
 
03:46:17.030 --> 03:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
as others have um attested to work in
 
03:46:19.790 --> 03:46:19.800 align:start position:0%
favor of businesses and small businesses
 
03:46:22.990 --> 03:46:23.000 align:start position:0%
alike this is this is a big opportunity
 
03:46:25.149 --> 03:46:25.159 align:start position:0%
um to put New Hampshire in line with
 
03:46:26.870 --> 03:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
several other states that have pic leave
 
03:46:31.309 --> 03:46:31.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:35.630 --> 03:46:35.640 align:start position:0%

03:47:53.630 --> 03:47:53.640 align:start position:0%
chairman infantine and members of the
 
03:47:56.830 --> 03:47:56.840 align:start position:0%
committee uh uh my name is Amanda Sears
 
03:47:58.950 --> 03:47:58.960 align:start position:0%
I'm the director of the campaign for a
 
03:48:01.950 --> 03:48:01.960 align:start position:0%
familyfriendly economy um excuse me we
 
03:48:03.510 --> 03:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
are a New Hampshire based uh group
 
03:48:05.309 --> 03:48:05.319 align:start position:0%
working to advance policies that help
 
03:48:07.950 --> 03:48:07.960 align:start position:0%
people to make ends meet and to be there
 
03:48:09.469 --> 03:48:09.479 align:start position:0%
for their families when they need to be
 
03:48:11.990 --> 03:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
and we're here in support of uh this
 
03:48:14.910 --> 03:48:14.920 align:start position:0%
bill uh this bill would ensure people
 
03:48:16.990 --> 03:48:17.000 align:start position:0%
who work can rely on their income to pay
 
03:48:18.750 --> 03:48:18.760 align:start position:0%
their bills um that they can continue to
 
03:48:20.830 --> 03:48:20.840 align:start position:0%
make ends meet when they need to be out
 
03:48:22.670 --> 03:48:22.680 align:start position:0%
of work for a day or a few days because
 
03:48:24.950 --> 03:48:24.960 align:start position:0%
they or a family member are sick you've
 
03:48:27.670 --> 03:48:27.680 align:start position:0%
heard about some of the um lack of
 
03:48:29.910 --> 03:48:29.920 align:start position:0%
access that uh about a third of our
 
03:48:33.030 --> 03:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
state faces with paid sick time um so I
 
03:48:35.870 --> 03:48:35.880 align:start position:0%
won't get into too much of that um but I
 
03:48:37.550 --> 03:48:37.560 align:start position:0%
think it's really important to focus on
 
03:48:39.189 --> 03:48:39.199 align:start position:0%
the fact that not all working people
 
03:48:41.309 --> 03:48:41.319 align:start position:0%
have equal access and so there is this
 
03:48:43.510 --> 03:48:43.520 align:start position:0%
real disparity between who has and does
 
03:48:46.269 --> 03:48:46.279 align:start position:0%
not have access to paid sick days um
 
03:48:48.149 --> 03:48:48.159 align:start position:0%
people who you heard from Dr Smith that
 
03:48:50.110 --> 03:48:50.120 align:start position:0%
people who work part-time hours are far
 
03:48:52.670 --> 03:48:52.680 align:start position:0%
less likely to have access other people
 
03:48:55.389 --> 03:48:55.399 align:start position:0%
who are far less likely are people who
 
03:48:57.110 --> 03:48:57.120 align:start position:0%
have caregiving responsibilities for
 
03:48:59.469 --> 03:48:59.479 align:start position:0%
other people so that includes both
 
03:49:02.229 --> 03:49:02.239 align:start position:0%
parents especially mothers um and
 
03:49:04.269 --> 03:49:04.279 align:start position:0%
families who have a person um within
 
03:49:06.790 --> 03:49:06.800 align:start position:0%
their family experiencing a disability
 
03:49:08.469 --> 03:49:08.479 align:start position:0%
and one of the main reasons for that is
 
03:49:10.630 --> 03:49:10.640 align:start position:0%
because those families are often working
 
03:49:12.790 --> 03:49:12.800 align:start position:0%
at patching together part-time jobs that
 
03:49:14.309 --> 03:49:14.319 align:start position:0%
they can patch together around their
 
03:49:14.319 --> 03:49:15.670 align:start position:0%
they can patch together around their
caregiving

03:49:15.670 --> 03:49:15.680 align:start position:0%
caregiving
 
03:49:18.149 --> 03:49:18.159 align:start position:0%
responsibilities um that means that the
 
03:49:20.149 --> 03:49:20.159 align:start position:0%
status quo in which all people don't
 
03:49:22.030 --> 03:49:22.040 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to earn paid sick
 
03:49:24.429 --> 03:49:24.439 align:start position:0%
time leads to the people who are most
 
03:49:25.990 --> 03:49:26.000 align:start position:0%
likely to need it because they have
 
03:49:27.830 --> 03:49:27.840 align:start position:0%
caregiving responsibilities are least
 
03:49:31.389 --> 03:49:31.399 align:start position:0%
likely to have it at the same time uh
 
03:49:33.189 --> 03:49:33.199 align:start position:0%
only about half of people working for
 
03:49:35.790 --> 03:49:35.800 align:start position:0%
less than $14 an hour have any paid time
 
03:49:38.229 --> 03:49:38.239 align:start position:0%
off they can use for a sick day um
 
03:49:40.510 --> 03:49:40.520 align:start position:0%
people working for the lowest wages are
 
03:49:42.910 --> 03:49:42.920 align:start position:0%
the most likely to be unable to pay for
 
03:49:45.149 --> 03:49:45.159 align:start position:0%
their basic needs when they lose pay
 
03:49:47.590 --> 03:49:47.600 align:start position:0%
from a sick day that they um don't get
 
03:49:50.670 --> 03:49:50.680 align:start position:0%
to take as earned paid time off for the
 
03:49:52.510 --> 03:49:52.520 align:start position:0%
typical family who doesn't have access
 
03:49:55.309 --> 03:49:55.319 align:start position:0%
to paid sick days three days of lost pay
 
03:49:57.389 --> 03:49:57.399 align:start position:0%
due to illness is equal to more than the
 
03:49:59.790 --> 03:49:59.800 align:start position:0%
family's grocery budget for the month so
 
03:50:02.030 --> 03:50:02.040 align:start position:0%
this has a really big impact not having
 
03:50:04.429 --> 03:50:04.439 align:start position:0%
access to to paid sick days has a big
 
03:50:06.750 --> 03:50:06.760 align:start position:0%
impact on the ability for for low-income
 
03:50:08.349 --> 03:50:08.359 align:start position:0%
families in particular to be able to
 
03:50:09.910 --> 03:50:09.920 align:start position:0%
meet their basic needs
 
03:50:12.550 --> 03:50:12.560 align:start position:0%
needs and working people without access
 
03:50:14.550 --> 03:50:14.560 align:start position:0%
to paid sick days are nearly twice as
 
03:50:16.670 --> 03:50:16.680 align:start position:0%
likely to report to work with contagious
 
03:50:19.229 --> 03:50:19.239 align:start position:0%
illnesses and this puts um not only
 
03:50:20.429 --> 03:50:20.439 align:start position:0%
themselves at risk but also their
 
03:50:23.630 --> 03:50:23.640 align:start position:0%
co-workers and their customers it also
 
03:50:25.830 --> 03:50:25.840 align:start position:0%
as you've heard from some um schools and
 
03:50:27.990 --> 03:50:28.000 align:start position:0%
and child care providers um ends up
 
03:50:29.590 --> 03:50:29.600 align:start position:0%
making it so that a lot more children
 
03:50:31.670 --> 03:50:31.680 align:start position:0%
are showing up to school and to child
 
03:50:33.830 --> 03:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
care without access with um when they
 
03:50:36.910 --> 03:50:36.920 align:start position:0%
are sick or family member is sick um
 
03:50:38.830 --> 03:50:38.840 align:start position:0%
paid sick day laws that are in effect in
 
03:50:40.389 --> 03:50:40.399 align:start position:0%
many stes States across the country and
 
03:50:42.710 --> 03:50:42.720 align:start position:0%
in um other states across New England
 
03:50:44.469 --> 03:50:44.479 align:start position:0%
have all been shown to drive down rates
 
03:50:46.510 --> 03:50:46.520 align:start position:0%
of contagious illnesses because people
 
03:50:48.429 --> 03:50:48.439 align:start position:0%
are able to stay home when they're sick
 
03:50:49.990 --> 03:50:50.000 align:start position:0%
and the pandemic has made it crystal
 
03:50:51.389 --> 03:50:51.399 align:start position:0%
clear that we're all better off when
 
03:50:54.469 --> 03:50:54.479 align:start position:0%
people who are sick can stay home uh
 
03:50:56.389 --> 03:50:56.399 align:start position:0%
without access people are going to work
 
03:50:59.070 --> 03:50:59.080 align:start position:0%
sick and I wanted to address a couple of
 
03:51:01.710 --> 03:51:01.720 align:start position:0%
things that came up from other speakers
 
03:51:04.950 --> 03:51:04.960 align:start position:0%
um one was the um notion that um some
 
03:51:07.429 --> 03:51:07.439 align:start position:0%
employers offer paid time off a pool
 
03:51:10.349 --> 03:51:10.359 align:start position:0%
that can be used um and so they um don't
 
03:51:12.950 --> 03:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
offer specifically paid sick time this
 
03:51:15.070 --> 03:51:15.080 align:start position:0%
bill accounts for that and and enables
 
03:51:16.990 --> 03:51:17.000 align:start position:0%
that as long as that paid time off can
 
03:51:19.710 --> 03:51:19.720 align:start position:0%
be used to satisfy the requirements of
 
03:51:21.389 --> 03:51:21.399 align:start position:0%
this chapter that it can be used for
 
03:51:23.389 --> 03:51:23.399 align:start position:0%
paid sick time to care for oneself or a
 
03:51:26.110 --> 03:51:26.120 align:start position:0%
family member that paid time off pool
 
03:51:28.429 --> 03:51:28.439 align:start position:0%
can be used in lie of this so that
 
03:51:31.110 --> 03:51:31.120 align:start position:0%
employer would not need to offer any
 
03:51:32.710 --> 03:51:32.720 align:start position:0%
additional paid sick time as long as
 
03:51:35.149 --> 03:51:35.159 align:start position:0%
they have a a policy that covers paid
 
03:51:37.550 --> 03:51:37.560 align:start position:0%
sick time as as indicated in this this
 
03:51:41.269 --> 03:51:41.279 align:start position:0%
law this bill um there was also a a um
 
03:51:44.670 --> 03:51:44.680 align:start position:0%
statement that was made um by um banek
 
03:51:46.429 --> 03:51:46.439 align:start position:0%
about um you know saying that you don't
 
03:51:48.870 --> 03:51:48.880 align:start position:0%
tell us what to pay people um you know
 
03:51:50.389 --> 03:51:50.399 align:start position:0%
you shouldn't tell us that people should
 
03:51:52.910 --> 03:51:52.920 align:start position:0%
have these benefits but in fact we do
 
03:51:55.269 --> 03:51:55.279 align:start position:0%
tell um employers that they need to have
 
03:51:57.550 --> 03:51:57.560 align:start position:0%
they have to pay a minimum wage so we do
 
03:52:00.149 --> 03:52:00.159 align:start position:0%
set a minimum wage for indicating what
 
03:52:02.349 --> 03:52:02.359 align:start position:0%
um employers need to pay people that's
 
03:52:04.349 --> 03:52:04.359 align:start position:0%
what this bill does is it sets a minimum
 
03:52:06.790 --> 03:52:06.800 align:start position:0%
floor saying you have to offer some paid
 
03:52:09.189 --> 03:52:09.199 align:start position:0%
sick time to people it sets a minimum
 
03:52:11.550 --> 03:52:11.560 align:start position:0%
and it allows employers to give anything
 
03:52:13.910 --> 03:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
above that and to implement it through a
 
03:52:16.630 --> 03:52:16.640 align:start position:0%
paid sick time or a paid time off policy
 
03:52:18.750 --> 03:52:18.760 align:start position:0%
but it sets a floor for this benefit
 
03:52:20.550 --> 03:52:20.560 align:start position:0%
just like the minimum wage sets a floor
 
03:52:23.630 --> 03:52:23.640 align:start position:0%
for wages um and then there um you know
 
03:52:25.149 --> 03:52:25.159 align:start position:0%
were concerns about the fears of
 
03:52:27.670 --> 03:52:27.680 align:start position:0%
business impact um and what I would just
 
03:52:30.349 --> 03:52:30.359 align:start position:0%
say you know as as Dr Mory already said
 
03:52:32.030 --> 03:52:32.040 align:start position:0%
if you actually look at the data for
 
03:52:34.110 --> 03:52:34.120 align:start position:0%
states that have implemented and cities
 
03:52:36.269 --> 03:52:36.279 align:start position:0%
um and communities that have implemented
 
03:52:38.429 --> 03:52:38.439 align:start position:0%
um this kind of a policy that doesn't
 
03:52:39.710 --> 03:52:39.720 align:start position:0%
bear out
 
03:52:42.389 --> 03:52:42.399 align:start position:0%
um and so in fact um they those places
 
03:52:44.149 --> 03:52:44.159 align:start position:0%
that have implemented paid sick time
 
03:52:46.630 --> 03:52:46.640 align:start position:0%
floors um that set a minimum require
 
03:52:48.429 --> 03:52:48.439 align:start position:0%
requirement have not seen a negative
 
03:52:50.070 --> 03:52:50.080 align:start position:0%
impact in the business Community because
 
03:52:52.910 --> 03:52:52.920 align:start position:0%
of those policies and um all of our
 
03:52:55.710 --> 03:52:55.720 align:start position:0%
neighboring states at this point do have
 
03:52:58.070 --> 03:52:58.080 align:start position:0%
um policies Maine it's a paid time off
 
03:52:59.630 --> 03:52:59.640 align:start position:0%
policy the other states are paid sick
 
03:53:01.830 --> 03:53:01.840 align:start position:0%
day policies but do have these kinds of
 
03:53:03.750 --> 03:53:03.760 align:start position:0%
policies in place so we are an outlier
 
03:53:06.229 --> 03:53:06.239 align:start position:0%
among among our neighbor States and with
 
03:53:07.510 --> 03:53:07.520 align:start position:0%
that I'd close and just say you know
 
03:53:09.229 --> 03:53:09.239 align:start position:0%
everybody gets sick and so every body
 
03:53:11.189 --> 03:53:11.199 align:start position:0%
deserves the opportunity to take time
 
03:53:14.630 --> 03:53:14.640 align:start position:0%
off from work um and uh we it's in our
 
03:53:16.750 --> 03:53:16.760 align:start position:0%
best interest to have people um able to
 
03:53:18.750 --> 03:53:18.760 align:start position:0%
stay stay home when they are sick so
 
03:53:20.670 --> 03:53:20.680 align:start position:0%

03:53:23.830 --> 03:53:23.840 align:start position:0%

for having this opportunity uh my name
 
03:54:40.389 --> 03:54:40.399 align:start position:0%
is Jonathan Weinberg I 21 years old and
 
03:54:41.950 --> 03:54:41.960 align:start position:0%
I'm a recently elected member of the
 
03:54:44.349 --> 03:54:44.359 align:start position:0%
conquered school board however I am here
 
03:54:46.229 --> 03:54:46.239 align:start position:0%
in my capacity as an individual and not
 
03:54:48.870 --> 03:54:48.880 align:start position:0%
speaking on behalf of the board we all
 
03:54:50.590 --> 03:54:50.600 align:start position:0%
know New Hampshire has to do everything
 
03:54:52.429 --> 03:54:52.439 align:start position:0%
possible to attract and retain young
 
03:54:55.149 --> 03:54:55.159 align:start position:0%
Working Families we have a rapidly aging
 
03:54:57.389 --> 03:54:57.399 align:start position:0%
population so much so that we have a
 
03:54:59.110 --> 03:54:59.120 align:start position:0%
Statewide committee dedicated to
 
03:55:00.750 --> 03:55:00.760 align:start position:0%
addressing the startling Revelation
 
03:55:03.110 --> 03:55:03.120 align:start position:0%
called the New Hampshire state plan on
 
03:55:05.910 --> 03:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
Aging research by the state sponsored
 
03:55:08.269 --> 03:55:08.279 align:start position:0%
committee states that by 2030
 
03:55:10.590 --> 03:55:10.600 align:start position:0%
approximately oneir of New Hampshire's
 
03:55:12.590 --> 03:55:12.600 align:start position:0%
population will be over
 
03:55:15.510 --> 03:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
65 these two issues combined illustrate
 
03:55:16.750 --> 03:55:16.760 align:start position:0%
that we have to do something much
 
03:55:18.790 --> 03:55:18.800 align:start position:0%
greater to attract people especially
 
03:55:20.630 --> 03:55:20.640 align:start position:0%
younger individuals and families to the
 
03:55:23.389 --> 03:55:23.399 align:start position:0%
Granite State when young families look
 
03:55:25.110 --> 03:55:25.120 align:start position:0%
at opportunities and compare these
 
03:55:26.590 --> 03:55:26.600 align:start position:0%
opportunities between a state that
 
03:55:29.070 --> 03:55:29.080 align:start position:0%
stands to support its workers and one
 
03:55:31.790 --> 03:55:31.800 align:start position:0%
that delegates paid sickly time to an
 
03:55:34.229 --> 03:55:34.239 align:start position:0%
employer's discretion it is obvious
 
03:55:36.149 --> 03:55:36.159 align:start position:0%
which option produces a more secure
 
03:55:37.990 --> 03:55:38.000 align:start position:0%
working environment an overall
 
03:55:41.110 --> 03:55:41.120 align:start position:0%
environment to raise a family voting yay
 
03:55:43.830 --> 03:55:43.840 align:start position:0%
on HB 590 will not only greatly benefit
 
03:55:46.469 --> 03:55:46.479 align:start position:0%
over 66% of granite Staters who do not
 
03:55:48.790 --> 03:55:48.800 align:start position:0%
have access to paid leave but will also
 
03:55:50.710 --> 03:55:50.720 align:start position:0%
help Elevate New Hampshire's status as
 
03:55:53.309 --> 03:55:53.319 align:start position:0%
an ideal employment destination and help
 
03:55:55.630 --> 03:55:55.640 align:start position:0%
attract younger workers to our state
 
03:55:55.640 --> 03:55:57.750 align:start position:0%
attract younger workers to our state

and is co-sponsored by a bipartisan
 
04:00:51.790 --> 04:00:51.800 align:start position:0%
group of legislators who are or were
 
04:00:54.030 --> 04:00:54.040 align:start position:0%
firefighters and we added a formal
 
04:00:55.990 --> 04:00:56.000 align:start position:0%
Federal Marshall the former Speaker of
 
04:00:58.710 --> 04:00:58.720 align:start position:0%
the House for good measure I was a
 
04:01:00.830 --> 04:01:00.840 align:start position:0%
volunteer firefighter in lemonster
 
04:01:03.790 --> 04:01:03.800 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts half a century ago but
 
04:01:06.389 --> 04:01:06.399 align:start position:0%
I've kept up with the fire service as a
 
04:01:09.750 --> 04:01:09.760 align:start position:0%
fire buff and as the proud father of a
 
04:01:13.349 --> 04:01:13.359 align:start position:0%
Manchester fire Lieutenant Steph Pearson
 
04:01:16.950 --> 04:01:16.960 align:start position:0%
who is also a legislator representing
 
04:01:20.309 --> 04:01:20.319 align:start position:0%
Derry I hang out at fire stations I go
 
04:01:23.030 --> 04:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
to fires and sometimes I even get asked
 
04:01:24.590 --> 04:01:24.600 align:start position:0%
to help humping
 
04:01:27.550 --> 04:01:27.560 align:start position:0%
hose my career path however was not in
 
04:01:32.070 --> 04:01:32.080 align:start position:0%
the fire service I was uh ordained in
 
04:01:35.030 --> 04:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
1974 and in nearly half a century of
 
04:01:37.389 --> 04:01:37.399 align:start position:0%
ordained Ministry I've had many
 
04:01:40.229 --> 04:01:40.239 align:start position:0%
firefighters at as parishioners I can
 
04:01:43.149 --> 04:01:43.159 align:start position:0%
think of several who died young with a
 
04:01:45.429 --> 04:01:45.439 align:start position:0%
few it would be difficult to determine
 
04:01:47.910 --> 04:01:47.920 align:start position:0%
in their cases whether their untimely
 
04:01:49.790 --> 04:01:49.800 align:start position:0%
deaths were from a career of being
 
04:01:52.309 --> 04:01:52.319 align:start position:0%
exposed to toxic smoke from burning
 
04:01:56.229 --> 04:01:56.239 align:start position:0%
buildings or from being chain smokers
 
04:01:57.830 --> 04:01:57.840 align:start position:0%
and being
 
04:02:00.630 --> 04:02:00.640 align:start position:0%
overweight however I also had some
 
04:02:02.469 --> 04:02:02.479 align:start position:0%
firefighter parishioners who never
 
04:02:04.910 --> 04:02:04.920 align:start position:0%
smoked who kept themselves in great
 
04:02:07.349 --> 04:02:07.359 align:start position:0%
shape and yet they came down with heart
 
04:02:10.750 --> 04:02:10.760 align:start position:0%
and lung or lung disease or both while
 
04:02:13.510 --> 04:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
their siblings did not what was the
 
04:02:15.149 --> 04:02:15.159 align:start position:0%
difference in their lives was it the
 
04:02:17.349 --> 04:02:17.359 align:start position:0%
toxic smoke they sucked in over their
 
04:02:20.030 --> 04:02:20.040 align:start position:0%
professional careers manifesting itself
 
04:02:23.429 --> 04:02:23.439 align:start position:0%
in disease in some cases decades
 
04:02:26.550 --> 04:02:26.560 align:start position:0%
afterwards I will leave to the people I
 
04:02:29.590 --> 04:02:29.600 align:start position:0%
hope will have come back to testify
 
04:02:31.710 --> 04:02:31.720 align:start position:0%
after me to support the growing
 
04:02:34.389 --> 04:02:34.399 align:start position:0%
scientific data but I'll leave you with
 
04:02:38.149 --> 04:02:38.159 align:start position:0%
this it's a cliche but it's ever so true
 
04:02:40.309 --> 04:02:40.319 align:start position:0%
firefighters run into the burning
 
04:02:42.389 --> 04:02:42.399 align:start position:0%
buildings everyone else is running out
 
04:02:45.349 --> 04:02:45.359 align:start position:0%
of and even with their air packs they
 
04:02:50.070 --> 04:02:50.080 align:start position:0%
suck in over a career Untold n amount of
 
04:02:52.590 --> 04:02:52.600 align:start position:0%
toxins that are known to cause both
 
04:02:55.429 --> 04:02:55.439 align:start position:0%
heart and lung disease they are not
 
04:02:57.550 --> 04:02:57.560 align:start position:0%
firefighters for the money anymore than
 
04:03:00.670 --> 04:03:00.680 align:start position:0%
we are legislators for the money for
 
04:03:04.349 --> 04:03:04.359 align:start position:0%
them as well as for us it's a calling
 
04:03:07.630 --> 04:03:07.640 align:start position:0%
sometimes their disease manifests
 
04:03:09.510 --> 04:03:09.520 align:start position:0%
quickly and they have to take early
 
04:03:11.469 --> 04:03:11.479 align:start position:0%
retirement for which workers
 
04:03:14.389 --> 04:03:14.399 align:start position:0%
compensation is available but some of
 
04:03:17.070 --> 04:03:17.080 align:start position:0%
them present with the illness years
 
04:03:19.750 --> 04:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
afterwards this bill would give such
 
04:03:22.910 --> 04:03:22.920 align:start position:0%
people the same break whenever there's
 
04:03:26.590 --> 04:03:26.600 align:start position:0%
an injury or a line of duty death and in
 
04:03:28.349 --> 04:03:28.359 align:start position:0%
fact on many other occasions we thank
 
04:03:30.830 --> 04:03:30.840 align:start position:0%
firefighters for their service let's
 
04:03:33.070 --> 04:03:33.080 align:start position:0%
also thank them by removing an
 
04:03:35.630 --> 04:03:35.640 align:start position:0%
artificial date Beyond which heart and
 
04:03:38.349 --> 04:03:38.359 align:start position:0%
lung diseases will no longer be covered
 
04:03:42.070 --> 04:03:42.080 align:start position:0%
by workers comp and that is my testimony
 
04:03:45.110 --> 04:03:45.120 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chairman and members of the
 
04:03:46.990 --> 04:03:47.000 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for your testimony
 
04:03:48.309 --> 04:03:48.319 align:start position:0%
representative any questions for the
 
04:03:52.550 --> 04:03:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:55.349 --> 04:03:55.359 align:start position:0%
online seeing none any questions for the
 
04:03:57.269 --> 04:03:57.279 align:start position:0%
members here in the committee
 
04:03:59.429 --> 04:03:59.439 align:start position:0%
room uh representative I have a question
 
04:04:04.030 --> 04:04:04.040 align:start position:0%
for you um I did uh I can't recall
 
04:04:05.870 --> 04:04:05.880 align:start position:0%
because I get I get old whe whether the
 
04:04:07.189 --> 04:04:07.199 align:start position:0%
last time I was in the legislature I
 
04:04:08.910 --> 04:04:08.920 align:start position:0%
thought this passed
 
04:04:12.229 --> 04:04:12.239 align:start position:0%
um and and it passed and it had this
 
04:04:15.269 --> 04:04:15.279 align:start position:0%
look back and from what I understand uh
 
04:04:18.550 --> 04:04:18.560 align:start position:0%
the first claim that was made U by a
 
04:04:20.429 --> 04:04:20.439 align:start position:0%
firefighter uh for a workers
 
04:04:22.670 --> 04:04:22.680 align:start position:0%
compensation um based on this bill it
 
04:04:25.389 --> 04:04:25.399 align:start position:0%
was denied and that's why you're coming
 
04:04:28.269 --> 04:04:28.279 align:start position:0%
back not you but the the organization is
 
04:04:30.550 --> 04:04:30.560 align:start position:0%
coming back to make the changes um
 
04:04:32.990 --> 04:04:33.000 align:start position:0%
because there was a fiveyear I believe
 
04:04:34.590 --> 04:04:34.600 align:start position:0%
look back period could you explain this
 
04:04:36.950 --> 04:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
to me um and
 
04:04:40.189 --> 04:04:40.199 align:start position:0%
in why we need to totally
 
04:04:42.790 --> 04:04:42.800 align:start position:0%
eliminate the look back period um you
 
04:04:43.910 --> 04:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
know there's a lot of things in the
 
04:04:46.830 --> 04:04:46.840 align:start position:0%
industry where you know kids are are
 
04:04:48.630 --> 04:04:48.640 align:start position:0%
tested for lead and it becomes the the
 
04:04:50.389 --> 04:04:50.399 align:start position:0%
Baseline and then they look to see what
 
04:04:50.399 --> 04:04:51.950 align:start position:0%
Baseline and then they look to see what
happens

04:04:51.950 --> 04:04:51.960 align:start position:0%
happens
 
04:04:53.950 --> 04:04:53.960 align:start position:0%
um you
 
04:04:53.960 --> 04:04:55.750 align:start position:0%
um you
know

04:04:55.750 --> 04:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:04:58.030 --> 04:04:58.040 align:start position:0%
why are you trying to get rid of any
 
04:05:00.269 --> 04:05:00.279 align:start position:0%
kind of look back or Baseline
 
04:05:02.630 --> 04:05:02.640 align:start position:0%
testing Mr chairman I can give you a
 
04:05:05.110 --> 04:05:05.120 align:start position:0%
broad answer because sometimes things
 
04:05:08.510 --> 04:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
present years afterwards but for a more
 
04:05:11.469 --> 04:05:11.479 align:start position:0%
technical answer I am hoping that uh a
 
04:05:13.750 --> 04:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of this bill fire lieutenant
 
04:05:16.830 --> 04:05:16.840 align:start position:0%
and representative Stephen Pearson is in
 
04:05:19.030 --> 04:05:19.040 align:start position:0%
this meeting and he can provide more
 
04:05:19.040 --> 04:05:20.309 align:start position:0%
this meeting and he can provide more
technical

04:05:20.309 --> 04:05:20.319 align:start position:0%
technical
 
04:05:22.269 --> 04:05:22.279 align:start position:0%
information all right thank you very
 
04:05:24.710 --> 04:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
much representative pearon yes sir see
 
04:05:26.990 --> 04:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
no other questions I will recognize uh
 
04:05:28.830 --> 04:05:28.840 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson representative
 
04:05:36.510 --> 04:05:36.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:41.590 --> 04:05:41.600 align:start position:0%
us yes I am can you hear me yes we can
 
04:05:43.229 --> 04:05:43.239 align:start position:0%
wonderful thank you I thank the
 
04:05:47.229 --> 04:05:47.239 align:start position:0%
committee um for allowing me to speak
 
04:05:49.510 --> 04:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
today I'm I'm gonna I'm going to touch
 
04:05:51.950 --> 04:05:51.960 align:start position:0%
on a little bit of the of the technical
 
04:05:53.990 --> 04:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
part of this I'm not going to get into
 
04:05:56.070 --> 04:05:56.080 align:start position:0%
the get overly technical because I don't
 
04:05:58.510 --> 04:05:58.520 align:start position:0%
think it it really it just confuses the
 
04:06:01.429 --> 04:06:01.439 align:start position:0%
matter so um incidentally January was
 
04:06:04.670 --> 04:06:04.680 align:start position:0%
firefighter cancer awareness month which
 
04:06:07.510 --> 04:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
um which is something that has really
 
04:06:09.750 --> 04:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
come onto the Forefront in the in the
 
04:06:13.510 --> 04:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
fire service in 2019 75% of all of the
 
04:06:15.030 --> 04:06:15.040 align:start position:0%
names that were added to the Fallen
 
04:06:16.870 --> 04:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
Firefighters Memorial in Colorado
 
04:06:19.149 --> 04:06:19.159 align:start position:0%
Springs were firefighters who died of
 
04:06:19.159 --> 04:06:20.389 align:start position:0%
Springs were firefighters who died of
Occupational

04:06:20.389 --> 04:06:20.399 align:start position:0%
Occupational
 
04:06:23.070 --> 04:06:23.080 align:start position:0%
cancer you know we we're exposed as
 
04:06:25.070 --> 04:06:25.080 align:start position:0%
firefighters as as my father was nice
 
04:06:27.750 --> 04:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
enough to to give me the the interlude
 
04:06:30.030 --> 04:06:30.040 align:start position:0%
there um we're exposed to a plethora of
 
04:06:32.189 --> 04:06:32.199 align:start position:0%
stuff you know while we work arenic
 
04:06:35.710 --> 04:06:35.720 align:start position:0%
asbest Benzene cadmium diesel exhaust
 
04:06:39.710 --> 04:06:39.720 align:start position:0%
from alahh silica vyl chloride and now
 
04:06:41.590 --> 04:06:41.600 align:start position:0%
which uh unfortunately we're learning
 
04:06:44.590 --> 04:06:44.600 align:start position:0%
that firefighting foam also is is become
 
04:06:46.790 --> 04:06:46.800 align:start position:0%
a these are known carcinogens this isn't
 
04:06:48.950 --> 04:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
even the list of suspected
 
04:06:52.710 --> 04:06:52.720 align:start position:0%
carcinogens so when you look at the
 
04:06:54.830 --> 04:06:54.840 align:start position:0%
those types of exposures the next
 
04:06:57.670 --> 04:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
question really begs is okay well what
 
04:06:59.229 --> 04:06:59.239 align:start position:0%
does that mean as far as the general
 
04:07:02.910 --> 04:07:02.920 align:start position:0%
population so when you look at the the
 
04:07:04.309 --> 04:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
the testing that's been done over the
 
04:07:08.149 --> 04:07:08.159 align:start position:0%
years and in the gobs of data that exist
 
04:07:11.030 --> 04:07:11.040 align:start position:0%
tracking disease of all types you notice
 
04:07:13.229 --> 04:07:13.239 align:start position:0%
that there's some things that stand out
 
04:07:15.550 --> 04:07:15.560 align:start position:0%
esophageal cancer you're 1.1 times
 
04:07:18.750 --> 04:07:18.760 align:start position:0%
greater leukemia 1.1 times greater colon
 
04:07:23.469 --> 04:07:23.479 align:start position:0%
cancer 1.2 prostate 1.2 brain cancer 1.3
 
04:07:25.910 --> 04:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
non hutkins lipoma one and a half times
 
04:07:29.389 --> 04:07:29.399 align:start position:0%
greater at risk um melanoma one and a
 
04:07:30.950 --> 04:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
half times greater at risk
 
04:07:34.469 --> 04:07:34.479 align:start position:0%
meso yeah it's a mouthful mesom two
 
04:07:36.950 --> 04:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
times the risk testicular cancer which
 
04:07:38.990 --> 04:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
is one of the big biggest ones well over
 
04:07:41.830 --> 04:07:41.840 align:start position:0%
two times likely more likely to develop
 
04:07:44.269 --> 04:07:44.279 align:start position:0%
cancer than the general population so
 
04:07:48.910 --> 04:07:48.920 align:start position:0%
this is certainly glowing data that
 
04:07:51.670 --> 04:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
comes out of this when you look at
 
04:07:53.429 --> 04:07:53.439 align:start position:0%
cancer in a
 
04:07:56.990 --> 04:07:57.000 align:start position:0%
comparison in a comparison U format
 
04:07:58.790 --> 04:07:58.800 align:start position:0%
simply because as we all know the
 
04:08:00.469 --> 04:08:00.479 align:start position:0%
general population gets cancer as well
 
04:08:02.990 --> 04:08:03.000 align:start position:0%
it's not unique to Firefighters so one
 
04:08:04.750 --> 04:08:04.760 align:start position:0%
of the things that has also happened in
 
04:08:06.229 --> 04:08:06.239 align:start position:0%
where this age
 
04:08:08.309 --> 04:08:08.319 align:start position:0%
elimination comes into into play
 
04:08:10.149 --> 04:08:10.159 align:start position:0%
honestly has to do with the way that the
 
04:08:11.469 --> 04:08:11.479 align:start position:0%
state of New
 
04:08:14.109 --> 04:08:14.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has restructured the pension
 
04:08:15.910 --> 04:08:15.920 align:start position:0%
system and I know you'd think well wait
 
04:08:17.109 --> 04:08:17.119 align:start position:0%
a minute what does that have to do with
 
04:08:19.229 --> 04:08:19.239 align:start position:0%
anything and I'll explain it to you when
 
04:08:20.630 --> 04:08:20.640 align:start position:0%
you get out of high
 
04:08:22.950 --> 04:08:22.960 align:start position:0%
school you know at this day and age
 
04:08:24.469 --> 04:08:24.479 align:start position:0%
you're you're either you may do a career
 
04:08:26.910 --> 04:08:26.920 align:start position:0%
in the military you may go to college
 
04:08:28.510 --> 04:08:28.520 align:start position:0%
either way but when you're done with
 
04:08:30.510 --> 04:08:30.520 align:start position:0%
that period of your life you enter the
 
04:08:32.269 --> 04:08:32.279 align:start position:0%
fire academy you become trained you
 
04:08:33.630 --> 04:08:33.640 align:start position:0%
become an EMT you go through the
 
04:08:35.189 --> 04:08:35.199 align:start position:0%
certification processes that are
 
04:08:38.910 --> 04:08:38.920 align:start position:0%
necessary to join this profession
 
04:08:41.830 --> 04:08:41.840 align:start position:0%
and that put you at a in a certain age
 
04:08:43.269 --> 04:08:43.279 align:start position:0%
window so
 
04:08:46.750 --> 04:08:46.760 align:start position:0%
now where for the predominancy of the
 
04:08:47.910 --> 04:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
fire service in the state of New
 
04:08:49.349 --> 04:08:49.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire professional firefighters
 
04:08:51.710 --> 04:08:51.720 align:start position:0%
would retire between the ages of like 53
 
04:08:56.630 --> 04:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
and 55 in order to qualify for a three
 
04:08:56.640 --> 04:08:58.030 align:start position:0%
and 55 in order to qualify for a three
quter

04:08:58.030 --> 04:08:58.040 align:start position:0%
quter
 
04:09:00.910 --> 04:09:00.920 align:start position:0%
pension you're working till
 
04:09:03.510 --> 04:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
65 that that's going to become for
 
04:09:05.229 --> 04:09:05.239 align:start position:0%
anybody that was hired after 2011 they
 
04:09:08.550 --> 04:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
will be working till they're 65 so so at
 
04:09:12.030 --> 04:09:12.040 align:start position:0%
a minimum you have to do 25 years so
 
04:09:13.790 --> 04:09:13.800 align:start position:0%
when you look at the math the simple
 
04:09:16.550 --> 04:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
math here 65 might have worked when you
 
04:09:18.030 --> 04:09:18.040 align:start position:0%
got out of the firefighting profession
 
04:09:20.950 --> 04:09:20.960 align:start position:0%
at 53 years old because there's a Time
 
04:09:22.710 --> 04:09:22.720 align:start position:0%
window there from when you stopped being
 
04:09:22.720 --> 04:09:23.750 align:start position:0%
window there from when you stopped being
exposed

04:09:23.750 --> 04:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
exposed
 
04:09:26.229 --> 04:09:26.239 align:start position:0%
until time progressed but if you're
 
04:09:29.830 --> 04:09:29.840 align:start position:0%
working till 65 if 65 becomes the cut
 
04:09:33.910 --> 04:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
off it basically says Hey when it's it's
 
04:09:35.590 --> 04:09:35.600 align:start position:0%
like the tail light warranty as soon as
 
04:09:39.590 --> 04:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
you leave the profession that's it and
 
04:09:40.830 --> 04:09:40.840 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:09:43.389 --> 04:09:43.399 align:start position:0%
we've I know that seems strange that
 
04:09:45.109 --> 04:09:45.119 align:start position:0%
that becomes a factor but it really does
 
04:09:47.309 --> 04:09:47.319 align:start position:0%
matter when when we've pushed out these
 
04:09:50.710 --> 04:09:50.720 align:start position:0%
careers and you know when
 
04:09:53.550 --> 04:09:53.560 align:start position:0%
you're so now because of that now the
 
04:09:55.870 --> 04:09:55.880 align:start position:0%
fire service has taken a significant
 
04:09:58.389 --> 04:09:58.399 align:start position:0%
movement towards prevention and Care
 
04:10:00.349 --> 04:10:00.359 align:start position:0%
cancer awareness like I said January was
 
04:10:02.229 --> 04:10:02.239 align:start position:0%
firefighter cancer awareness
 
04:10:05.990 --> 04:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
month and focusing on firefighter cancer
 
04:10:08.670 --> 04:10:08.680 align:start position:0%
within the profession is great to limit
 
04:10:11.269 --> 04:10:11.279 align:start position:0%
and reduce or attempt to reduce
 
04:10:13.269 --> 04:10:13.279 align:start position:0%
exposures and we've recognized a lot of
 
04:10:15.149 --> 04:10:15.159 align:start position:0%
areas where that is occurring but it
 
04:10:18.309 --> 04:10:18.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't eliminate the substantial risk
 
04:10:18.319 --> 04:10:19.469 align:start position:0%
doesn't eliminate the substantial risk
that

04:10:19.469 --> 04:10:19.479 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:10:22.710 --> 04:10:22.720 align:start position:0%
exists so that's that's basically to
 
04:10:24.109 --> 04:10:24.119 align:start position:0%
answer the question that you asked Mr
 
04:10:28.389 --> 04:10:28.399 align:start position:0%
chairman as far as why the 65 age really
 
04:10:31.030 --> 04:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
needs to come out of this is because
 
04:10:33.750 --> 04:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
we're working up until that point now
 
04:10:35.469 --> 04:10:35.479 align:start position:0%
and these cancers are not necessarily
 
04:10:38.510 --> 04:10:38.520 align:start position:0%
manifesting themselves in people within
 
04:10:40.229 --> 04:10:40.239 align:start position:0%
that time frame
 
04:10:43.109 --> 04:10:43.119 align:start position:0%
so that's really the in my eyes the
 
04:10:44.830 --> 04:10:44.840 align:start position:0%
predominant reason why this this needs
 
04:10:46.990 --> 04:10:47.000 align:start position:0%
to go away when there's just
 
04:10:49.149 --> 04:10:49.159 align:start position:0%
overwhelming data and evidence that that
 
04:10:51.309 --> 04:10:51.319 align:start position:0%
firefighters develop cancer at a much
 
04:10:56.309 --> 04:10:56.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:58.469 --> 04:10:58.479 align:start position:0%
population all right thank you for your
 
04:11:02.309 --> 04:11:02.319 align:start position:0%
testimony um I think that's the end um
 
04:11:05.349 --> 04:11:05.359 align:start position:0%
quite sure are you still there with US
 
04:11:06.990 --> 04:11:07.000 align:start position:0%
Representative which representative are
 
04:11:08.750 --> 04:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
you referring too okay I wasn't sure if
 
04:11:10.229 --> 04:11:10.239 align:start position:0%
we lost you or not any questions for the
 
04:11:12.670 --> 04:11:12.680 align:start position:0%
representative in the committee
 
04:11:16.910 --> 04:11:16.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:19.469 --> 04:11:19.479 align:start position:0%
online I don't see any hands up thank
 
04:11:21.309 --> 04:11:21.319 align:start position:0%
you very much for your testimony now
 
04:11:24.830 --> 04:11:24.840 align:start position:0%
calling on Brian will professional
 
04:11:28.269 --> 04:11:28.279 align:start position:0%
firefighters of New Hampshire um and

firefighters and paramedics that I
 
04:12:04.189 --> 04:12:04.199 align:start position:0%
represent I'm providing testimony and
 
04:12:07.830 --> 04:12:07.840 align:start position:0%
support of HB 385 FN uh relative to
 
04:12:09.550 --> 04:12:09.560 align:start position:0%
workers compensation for heart and lung
 
04:12:11.109 --> 04:12:11.119 align:start position:0%
disease and
 
04:12:13.389 --> 04:12:13.399 align:start position:0%
firefighters It is Well documented that
 
04:12:14.990 --> 04:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
throughout the course of their Duty
 
04:12:17.630 --> 04:12:17.640 align:start position:0%
firefighters are subject uh subjected to
 
04:12:19.950 --> 04:12:19.960 align:start position:0%
a number of Occupational hazards that
 
04:12:22.950 --> 04:12:22.960 align:start position:0%
clearly take a toll on the human body
 
04:12:24.990 --> 04:12:25.000 align:start position:0%
the routine exposure to high physical
 
04:12:27.349 --> 04:12:27.359 align:start position:0%
and emotional stress heat and
 
04:12:27.359 --> 04:12:28.429 align:start position:0%
and emotional stress heat and
cancer-causing

04:12:28.429 --> 04:12:28.439 align:start position:0%
cancer-causing
 
04:12:30.630 --> 04:12:30.640 align:start position:0%
carcinogens makes it far more likely
 
04:12:31.950 --> 04:12:31.960 align:start position:0%
that a firefighter will develop
 
04:12:34.950 --> 04:12:34.960 align:start position:0%
cardiovascular disease lung disease or
 
04:12:37.389 --> 04:12:37.399 align:start position:0%
cancer the American Heart Association
 
04:12:39.269 --> 04:12:39.279 align:start position:0%
cites sudden cardiac death as the
 
04:12:41.550 --> 04:12:41.560 align:start position:0%
leading cause of death for firefighters
 
04:12:45.189 --> 04:12:45.199 align:start position:0%
at approximately 45% of all job related
 
04:12:47.950 --> 04:12:47.960 align:start position:0%
deaths repeated injury as a result of
 
04:12:50.750 --> 04:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
physical strain emotional stress or
 
04:12:53.269 --> 04:12:53.279 align:start position:0%
exposure to carcinogens or infectious
 
04:12:55.750 --> 04:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
diseases have a cumulative effect on the
 
04:12:57.670 --> 04:12:57.680 align:start position:0%
human body that increases the
 
04:12:59.830 --> 04:12:59.840 align:start position:0%
firefighter's risk of cardiovascular
 
04:13:02.790 --> 04:13:02.800 align:start position:0%
disease moreover the National Institute
 
04:13:04.790 --> 04:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
of Occupational Safety and Health's most
 
04:13:07.750 --> 04:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
recent study shows that firefighters
 
04:13:11.590 --> 04:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
uh at least at a 14% increased risk uh
 
04:13:13.269 --> 04:13:13.279 align:start position:0%
of dying from cancer as opposed to the
 
04:13:15.349 --> 04:13:15.359 align:start position:0%
general population so you heard
 
04:13:17.429 --> 04:13:17.439 align:start position:0%
testimony from Representative Steve
 
04:13:20.950 --> 04:13:20.960 align:start position:0%
Pearson who mentioned all those um
 
04:13:22.469 --> 04:13:22.479 align:start position:0%
different cancer
 
04:13:25.269 --> 04:13:25.279 align:start position:0%
diagnosises and uh the increase as
 
04:13:27.670 --> 04:13:27.680 align:start position:0%
opposed to the general population and uh
 
04:13:29.469 --> 04:13:29.479 align:start position:0%
just to reiterate that that total is a
 
04:13:33.109 --> 04:13:33.119 align:start position:0%
14% increase risk uh which is
 
04:13:35.269 --> 04:13:35.279 align:start position:0%
staggering the Hazardous nature of the
 
04:13:37.910 --> 04:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
fire service industry is it's never been
 
04:13:39.870 --> 04:13:39.880 align:start position:0%
disputed and in fact the state of New
 
04:13:41.910 --> 04:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has already recognized the
 
04:13:44.149 --> 04:13:44.159 align:start position:0%
serious nature and sometimes
 
04:13:46.469 --> 04:13:46.479 align:start position:0%
catastrophic effects of this profession
 
04:13:48.750 --> 04:13:48.760 align:start position:0%
by adopting legislation that states when
 
04:13:50.990 --> 04:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
a firefighter is diagnosed with heart
 
04:13:53.429 --> 04:13:53.439 align:start position:0%
lung or cancer disease is presumed to
 
04:13:56.990 --> 04:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
have been occupationally related HB 385
 
04:13:59.070 --> 04:13:59.080 align:start position:0%
would simply eliminate that sunset
 
04:14:01.550 --> 04:14:01.560 align:start position:0%
provision um that this benefit would not
 
04:14:04.269 --> 04:14:04.279 align:start position:0%
continue past the firefighter's 65th
 
04:14:06.630 --> 04:14:06.640 align:start position:0%
birthday firefighters routinely risk
 
04:14:08.469 --> 04:14:08.479 align:start position:0%
their lives to protect the citizens and
 
04:14:10.389 --> 04:14:10.399 align:start position:0%
the communities they serve and are
 
04:14:13.149 --> 04:14:13.159 align:start position:0%
oftentimes rewarded with cardiovascular
 
04:14:15.710 --> 04:14:15.720 align:start position:0%
disease pulmonary illness or a cancer
 
04:14:18.109 --> 04:14:18.119 align:start position:0%
diagnosis for their efforts it is
 
04:14:19.710 --> 04:14:19.720 align:start position:0%
incumbent upon us to show these
 
04:14:21.149 --> 04:14:21.159 align:start position:0%
firefighters that we will always have
 
04:14:22.950 --> 04:14:22.960 align:start position:0%
their back for the service they provide
 
04:14:25.149 --> 04:14:25.159 align:start position:0%
to this great state and not just until
 
04:14:26.309 --> 04:14:26.319 align:start position:0%
they turn
 
04:14:28.429 --> 04:14:28.439 align:start position:0%
65 I respectfully ask for the
 
04:14:31.630 --> 04:14:31.640 align:start position:0%
committee's full support of HB 385 and
 
04:14:33.429 --> 04:14:33.439 align:start position:0%
uh I'm happy to entertain any questions
 
04:14:34.630 --> 04:14:34.640 align:start position:0%
you may have of
 
04:14:38.990 --> 04:14:39.000 align:start position:0%
me thank you any questions for the
 
04:14:41.870 --> 04:14:41.880 align:start position:0%
speaker in the committee
 
04:14:46.149 --> 04:14:46.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:49.870 --> 04:14:49.880 align:start position:0%
online uh Brian I have a question for
 
04:14:51.189 --> 04:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
you I'm just
 
04:14:55.070 --> 04:14:55.080 align:start position:0%
reading the uh I'm reading this 281 a17
 
04:14:56.870 --> 04:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
and quite frankly before I started
 
04:14:58.309 --> 04:14:58.319 align:start position:0%
reading this I thought you were trying
 
04:15:00.389 --> 04:15:00.399 align:start position:0%
to get rid of the fiveyear there there
 
04:15:02.630 --> 04:15:02.640 align:start position:0%
there's two dates okay you talk about
 
04:15:05.710 --> 04:15:05.720 align:start position:0%
here in the legislation
 
04:15:07.510 --> 04:15:07.520 align:start position:0%
um Rel
 
04:15:09.149 --> 04:15:09.159 align:start position:0%
repeal the relative to the length of
 
04:15:10.710 --> 04:15:10.720 align:start position:0%
time of the presumption of heart or lung
 
04:15:11.750 --> 04:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
disease in members of the fire
 
04:15:14.630 --> 04:15:14.640 align:start position:0%
department there's no debate here uh nor
 
04:15:17.030 --> 04:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
was there believe years ago that
 
04:15:20.630 --> 04:15:20.640 align:start position:0%
firefighters uh are have great
 
04:15:23.510 --> 04:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
propensity for cancer uh than others
 
04:15:25.950 --> 04:15:25.960 align:start position:0%
that's why this law was passed uh there
 
04:15:28.469 --> 04:15:28.479 align:start position:0%
are two things that I see in the
 
04:15:31.030 --> 04:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
law uh a retired firefighter who agrees
 
04:15:32.750 --> 04:15:32.760 align:start position:0%
to submit to a physical examination
 
04:15:34.870 --> 04:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
request by a city town or Precinct shall
 
04:15:36.389 --> 04:15:36.399 align:start position:0%
have the benefit of the prim of facial
 
04:15:38.469 --> 04:15:38.479 align:start position:0%
presumption only during the period of
 
04:15:40.750 --> 04:15:40.760 align:start position:0%
time of 5 Years From the effective date
 
04:15:43.269 --> 04:15:43.279 align:start position:0%
of the firefighter's retirement that is
 
04:15:50.149 --> 04:15:50.159 align:start position:0%
that the sub the the item you want to um
 
04:15:54.030 --> 04:15:54.040 align:start position:0%
extend because you say C and I don't see
 
04:15:56.710 --> 04:15:56.720 align:start position:0%
uh I see the benefit of RSA shall not
 
04:15:58.630 --> 04:15:58.640 align:start position:0%
continue in effect Beyond one month
 
04:16:01.189 --> 04:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
after a call volunteer or permanent
 
04:16:04.510 --> 04:16:04.520 align:start position:0%
firefighter reaches his or her 65th
 
04:16:06.269 --> 04:16:06.279 align:start position:0%
birthday that's the item you want to
 
04:16:08.309 --> 04:16:08.319 align:start position:0%
change correct
 
04:16:10.550 --> 04:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
uh correct sir and I would defer to the
 
04:16:12.950 --> 04:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
um Prime sponsor of the bill but as I
 
04:16:17.750 --> 04:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
understand it uh it would be 281a 17 C
 
04:16:20.229 --> 04:16:20.239 align:start position:0%
that second one that you mentioned okay
 
04:16:22.910 --> 04:16:22.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not trying to be combative I'm just
 
04:16:24.710 --> 04:16:24.720 align:start position:0%
trying to understand what you're asking
 
04:16:28.750 --> 04:16:28.760 align:start position:0%
me to pass you stated that firefighters
 
04:16:32.990 --> 04:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
now with a new pension have to serve
 
04:16:35.870 --> 04:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
until 65 years of age
 
04:16:39.750 --> 04:16:39.760 align:start position:0%
correct um so that I believe what
 
04:16:41.750 --> 04:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
representative uh Steve Pearson was
 
04:16:44.389 --> 04:16:44.399 align:start position:0%
referring to uh is new firefighters with
 
04:16:46.630 --> 04:16:46.640 align:start position:0%
a change of the retirement system have
 
04:16:49.670 --> 04:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
to work longer into their uh careers
 
04:16:54.910 --> 04:16:54.920 align:start position:0%
both in age and uh years of service so
 
04:16:58.389 --> 04:16:58.399 align:start position:0%
um for some firefighters uh so so the
 
04:17:00.070 --> 04:17:00.080 align:start position:0%
retirement system does not mandate that
 
04:17:03.349 --> 04:17:03.359 align:start position:0%
they have to work until age 65 uh
 
04:17:04.309 --> 04:17:04.319 align:start position:0%
however with the changes in the
 
04:17:06.109 --> 04:17:06.119 align:start position:0%
retirement system in order for them to
 
04:17:06.119 --> 04:17:07.309 align:start position:0%
retirement system in order for them to
receive

04:17:07.309 --> 04:17:07.319 align:start position:0%
receive
 
04:17:10.109 --> 04:17:10.119 align:start position:0%
a uh pension that they would have
 
04:17:13.670 --> 04:17:13.680 align:start position:0%
received back in 2011 they have to work
 
04:17:16.710 --> 04:17:16.720 align:start position:0%
uh longer into their careers um which
 
04:17:18.990 --> 04:17:19.000 align:start position:0%
for many folks uh as the representative
 
04:17:22.189 --> 04:17:22.199 align:start position:0%
mentioned could be age 65 um so when you
 
04:17:25.149 --> 04:17:25.159 align:start position:0%
look back on uh protecting these
 
04:17:29.229 --> 04:17:29.239 align:start position:0%
firefighters past that age um it's
 
04:17:31.429 --> 04:17:31.439 align:start position:0%
looking at trying to protect them into
 
04:17:33.030 --> 04:17:33.040 align:start position:0%
the early years of their
 
04:17:35.590 --> 04:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
retirement I hope that answers your
 
04:17:39.750 --> 04:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:41.710 --> 04:17:41.720 align:start position:0%
it is my understanding that all workers
 
04:17:42.950 --> 04:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
compensation in the state of New
 
04:17:45.229 --> 04:17:45.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire terminates at age 65 and at
 
04:17:45.239 --> 04:17:46.109 align:start position:0%
Hampshire terminates at age 65 and at
that

04:17:46.109 --> 04:17:46.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:17:46.119 --> 04:17:48.750 align:start position:0%
that
point

04:17:48.750 --> 04:17:48.760 align:start position:0%
point
 
04:17:52.750 --> 04:17:52.760 align:start position:0%
um other benefits um whether they be
 
04:17:56.030 --> 04:17:56.040 align:start position:0%
Medicare Medicaid other mechanisms fall
 
04:17:59.149 --> 04:17:59.159 align:start position:0%
into play which is why this was I
 
04:17:59.159 --> 04:18:00.429 align:start position:0%
into play which is why this was I
believe

04:18:00.429 --> 04:18:00.439 align:start position:0%
believe
 
04:18:02.429 --> 04:18:02.439 align:start position:0%
terminated at
 
04:18:05.710 --> 04:18:05.720 align:start position:0%
65 you are asking this
 
04:18:05.720 --> 04:18:07.389 align:start position:0%
65 you are asking this
be

04:18:07.389 --> 04:18:07.399 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:18:09.910 --> 04:18:09.920 align:start position:0%
appealed so there is
 
04:18:12.870 --> 04:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
no termination of workers compensation
 
04:18:14.710 --> 04:18:14.720 align:start position:0%
benefits till
 
04:18:17.950 --> 04:18:17.960 align:start position:0%
death correct
 
04:18:20.469 --> 04:18:20.479 align:start position:0%
sir again I would defer to the to the
 
04:18:22.309 --> 04:18:22.319 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor of the bill to correct me
 
04:18:24.790 --> 04:18:24.800 align:start position:0%
on that uh if I'm
 
04:18:26.590 --> 04:18:26.600 align:start position:0%
misinformed understood are there any
 
04:18:31.070 --> 04:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:34.349 --> 04:18:34.359 align:start position:0%
speaker okay cenan thank you very
 
04:18:37.189 --> 04:18:37.199 align:start position:0%
much the last individual I had have to
 
04:18:40.510 --> 04:18:40.520 align:start position:0%
to speak at least on my my sheets was uh
 
04:18:42.910 --> 04:18:42.920 align:start position:0%
Warner horn a member of the public is in
 
04:18:48.630 --> 04:18:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:51.590 --> 04:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
us good afternoon Mr chairman I hope you
 
04:18:56.030 --> 04:18:56.040 align:start position:0%
can hear me we can good afternoon Mr
 
04:18:58.550 --> 04:18:58.560 align:start position:0%
chairman members of the labor committee
 
04:19:01.630 --> 04:19:01.640 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Warner horn I
 
04:19:04.950 --> 04:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
am from Franklin I was the original
 
04:19:06.950 --> 04:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
co-spon I was the original Prime sponsor
 
04:19:09.349 --> 04:19:09.359 align:start position:0%
for this legislation last
 
04:19:13.710 --> 04:19:13.720 align:start position:0%
year uh we sadly lost it to the coid
 
04:19:16.030 --> 04:19:16.040 align:start position:0%
crisis and representative Pearson has
 
04:19:19.109 --> 04:19:19.119 align:start position:0%
kindly resubmitted it on my
 
04:19:23.550 --> 04:19:23.560 align:start position:0%
behalf and I can definitely clarify for
 
04:19:26.349 --> 04:19:26.359 align:start position:0%
the Chairman's question earlier that the
 
04:19:29.229 --> 04:19:29.239 align:start position:0%
goal of this legislation is to repeal
 
04:19:33.189 --> 04:19:33.199 align:start position:0%
the age cap for the death benefit
 
04:19:35.830 --> 04:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
specifically uh here in Franklin we lost
 
04:19:39.830 --> 04:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
a firefighter some years ago who was
 
04:19:43.189 --> 04:19:43.199 align:start position:0%
70 there's no doubt that his death was
 
04:19:45.429 --> 04:19:45.439 align:start position:0%
directly linked to his fire service
 
04:19:47.429 --> 04:19:47.439 align:start position:0%
career he was a call firefighter for
 
04:19:50.510 --> 04:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
many many years here in Franklin and uh
 
04:19:52.109 --> 04:19:52.119 align:start position:0%
when he passed he passed very quickly
 
04:19:55.070 --> 04:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
about 90 days or so from diagnosis to
 
04:19:57.870 --> 04:19:57.880 align:start position:0%
his passing and his family was unable to
 
04:19:59.630 --> 04:19:59.640 align:start position:0%
collect on a death benefit through
 
04:20:02.269 --> 04:20:02.279 align:start position:0%
workers comp because of his Advanced
 
04:20:07.710 --> 04:20:07.720 align:start position:0%
age um the legislation seeks to repeal
 
04:20:11.229 --> 04:20:11.239 align:start position:0%
the age cap at 65 if a firefighter
 
04:20:14.149 --> 04:20:14.159 align:start position:0%
retires at 53 they have 5 years to
 
04:20:16.550 --> 04:20:16.560 align:start position:0%
establish that there is a condition
 
04:20:18.510 --> 04:20:18.520 align:start position:0%
connected to their service if a
 
04:20:21.830 --> 04:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
firefighter chooses to retire at 63 then
 
04:20:24.510 --> 04:20:24.520 align:start position:0%
they only have two years to establish
 
04:20:27.149 --> 04:20:27.159 align:start position:0%
that their illness
 
04:20:30.830 --> 04:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
is tied to their fire service um this is
 
04:20:34.229 --> 04:20:34.239 align:start position:0%
kind of an injustice in my view because
 
04:20:36.710 --> 04:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire especially Northern New
 
04:20:38.309 --> 04:20:38.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and Western New Hampshire we
 
04:20:41.389 --> 04:20:41.399 align:start position:0%
are increasing reliant on firefighters
 
04:20:43.269 --> 04:20:43.279 align:start position:0%
deeper into their
 
04:20:48.870 --> 04:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
lives and to say that they can't get
 
04:20:50.590 --> 04:20:50.600 align:start position:0%
this death benefit or their families
 
04:20:52.189 --> 04:20:52.199 align:start position:0%
actually their families specifically are
 
04:20:53.830 --> 04:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
the ones who would be receiving this
 
04:20:56.750 --> 04:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
death benefit um it does not seem right
 
04:20:59.910 --> 04:20:59.920 align:start position:0%
to me uh even if you are a 70-year old
 
04:21:02.990 --> 04:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
firefighter and you are outside of the
 
04:21:06.550 --> 04:21:06.560 align:start position:0%
building on a pumper truck if the wind
 
04:21:08.710 --> 04:21:08.720 align:start position:0%
takes that smoke coming from the
 
04:21:10.750 --> 04:21:10.760 align:start position:0%
building and changes Direction suddenly
 
04:21:12.389 --> 04:21:12.399 align:start position:0%
and pushes it through the path of the
 
04:21:14.630 --> 04:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
pumper they can be exposed to those
 
04:21:17.830 --> 04:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
toxic fumes um because they're not
 
04:21:20.590 --> 04:21:20.600 align:start position:0%
wearing an air pack when they're on the
 
04:21:20.600 --> 04:21:22.229 align:start position:0%
wearing an air pack when they're on the
Pumpers

04:21:22.229 --> 04:21:22.239 align:start position:0%
Pumpers
 
04:21:26.070 --> 04:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
um so the fiveyear period is not
 
04:21:27.510 --> 04:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
anything that I'm see that would be
 
04:21:29.070 --> 04:21:29.080 align:start position:0%
changed by this legislation this
 
04:21:31.349 --> 04:21:31.359 align:start position:0%
legislation is specifically targeting
 
04:21:33.109 --> 04:21:33.119 align:start position:0%
whether the death benefit would be cut
 
04:21:36.149 --> 04:21:36.159 align:start position:0%
off at 65 and with that I'm happy to
 
04:21:41.550 --> 04:21:41.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:44.510 --> 04:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
committee any questions for the speaker
 
04:21:46.790 --> 04:21:46.800 align:start position:0%
um in the committee
 
04:21:50.309 --> 04:21:50.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:55.349 --> 04:21:55.359 align:start position:0%
online um Mr uh horn I have a question
 
04:21:57.870 --> 04:21:57.880 align:start position:0%
would you please reiterate the example
 
04:21:59.389 --> 04:21:59.399 align:start position:0%
you gave of
 
04:22:01.710 --> 04:22:01.720 align:start position:0%
Franklin the firefighter who passed away
 
04:22:03.750 --> 04:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
and why he wasn't able to
 
04:22:06.910 --> 04:22:06.920 align:start position:0%
collect Captain Robert Brown passed away
 
04:22:09.510 --> 04:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
way at the 70 years
 
04:22:15.189 --> 04:22:15.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:18.030 --> 04:22:18.040 align:start position:0%
is his death it's unlik it's Unthinkable
 
04:22:19.349 --> 04:22:19.359 align:start position:0%
that his death wouldn't be connected to
 
04:22:20.990 --> 04:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
his fire service he passed away from
 
04:22:23.950 --> 04:22:23.960 align:start position:0%
cancer um diagnosis to death was about
 
04:22:23.960 --> 04:22:24.910 align:start position:0%
cancer um diagnosis to death was about
90

04:22:24.910 --> 04:22:24.920 align:start position:0%
90
 
04:22:27.950 --> 04:22:27.960 align:start position:0%
days because he was 70 he would his
 
04:22:30.269 --> 04:22:30.279 align:start position:0%
family was unable to collect on a death
 
04:22:32.990 --> 04:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
benefit through workers comp okay could
 
04:22:34.750 --> 04:22:34.760 align:start position:0%
you please explain what you mean by
 
04:22:38.309 --> 04:22:38.319 align:start position:0%
death benefit
 
04:22:40.750 --> 04:22:40.760 align:start position:0%
the the section that we're talking about
 
04:22:45.269 --> 04:22:45.279 align:start position:0%
here is um specific to workers comp and
 
04:22:46.790 --> 04:22:46.800 align:start position:0%
the death benefit if somebody passes
 
04:22:48.590 --> 04:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
away from heart or lung
 
04:22:51.229 --> 04:22:51.239 align:start position:0%
conditions so this isn't a disability
 
04:22:54.950 --> 04:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:59.830 --> 04:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
issue got me totally confused so you
 
04:23:04.149 --> 04:23:04.159 align:start position:0%
read from sub paragraph C the benefits
 
04:23:07.429 --> 04:23:07.439 align:start position:0%
of RSA 281 a 7
 
04:23:09.830 --> 04:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
one shall not continue in effect Beyond
 
04:23:11.269 --> 04:23:11.279 align:start position:0%
one month after a call volunteer a
 
04:23:13.149 --> 04:23:13.159 align:start position:0%
permanent firefighter reaches his six
 
04:23:16.830 --> 04:23:16.840 align:start position:0%
his or her 65th birthday and the chapter
 
04:23:18.349 --> 04:23:18.359 align:start position:0%
is exclusive
 
04:23:18.359 --> 04:23:21.149 align:start position:0%
is exclusive
to

04:23:21.149 --> 04:23:21.159 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:23:24.630 --> 04:23:24.640 align:start position:0%
um the heart and lung conditions and the
 
04:23:24.640 --> 04:23:31.950 align:start position:0%
um the heart and lung conditions and the
death

04:23:31.950 --> 04:23:31.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:34.590 --> 04:23:34.600 align:start position:0%
benefit I'm just confused I'm not again
 
04:23:37.309 --> 04:23:37.319 align:start position:0%
I'm not trying to be combative here the
 
04:23:40.229 --> 04:23:40.239 align:start position:0%
only death benefit provided in a workers
 
04:23:40.239 --> 04:23:41.790 align:start position:0%
only death benefit provided in a workers
compensation

04:23:41.790 --> 04:23:41.800 align:start position:0%
compensation
 
04:23:46.630 --> 04:23:46.640 align:start position:0%
policy is I believe uh $110,000 burial
 
04:23:49.630 --> 04:23:49.640 align:start position:0%
fee burial payment the only other
 
04:23:50.910 --> 04:23:50.920 align:start position:0%
benefit you're talking about is either
 
04:23:54.149 --> 04:23:54.159 align:start position:0%
medical or Indemnity which is loss of
 
04:23:58.389 --> 04:23:58.399 align:start position:0%

04:24:15.950 --> 04:24:15.960 align:start position:0%

04:26:21.750 --> 04:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
sitting in my in a spare bedroom at home
 
04:26:23.710 --> 04:26:23.720 align:start position:0%
but I will sit I will sit here it looks
 
04:26:24.510 --> 04:26:24.520 align:start position:0%
like the
 
04:26:28.790 --> 04:26:28.800 align:start position:0%
L that's a uh that's a Ply cheap plywood
 
04:26:30.109 --> 04:26:30.119 align:start position:0%
closet behind
 
04:26:33.910 --> 04:26:33.920 align:start position:0%
me um anyway I am uh representative
 
04:26:36.429 --> 04:26:36.439 align:start position:0%
Michael kahill from the Rockingham 7 new
 
04:26:39.229 --> 04:26:39.239 align:start position:0%
fields and New Market and we are here
 
04:26:41.510 --> 04:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
today to discuss HB
 
04:26:44.870 --> 04:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
501 um establishing a minimum pay rate
 
04:26:46.710 --> 04:26:46.720 align:start position:0%
for adjunct faculty the university
 
04:26:48.429 --> 04:26:48.439 align:start position:0%
system of New Hampshire and Community
 
04:26:53.429 --> 04:26:53.439 align:start position:0%
College of New Hampshire uh they are
 
04:26:55.830 --> 04:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
they they do have a union and they are
 
04:26:57.870 --> 04:26:57.880 align:start position:0%
of course public employees and their
 
04:26:59.469 --> 04:26:59.479 align:start position:0%
option they can't strike or anything
 
04:27:01.030 --> 04:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
like this but they've been in
 
04:27:03.870 --> 04:27:03.880 align:start position:0%
negotiations which have gone nowhere
 
04:27:08.389 --> 04:27:08.399 align:start position:0%
very actually without a contract and
 
04:27:10.630 --> 04:27:10.640 align:start position:0%
they not getting much assistance with
 
04:27:13.189 --> 04:27:13.199 align:start position:0%
the uh with the University or with the
 
04:27:16.790 --> 04:27:16.800 align:start position:0%
community college system so uh I bring
 
04:27:18.109 --> 04:27:18.119 align:start position:0%
it to your attention I'm going to share
 
04:27:22.429 --> 04:27:22.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:22.439 --> 04:27:24.429 align:start position:0%
 
and

04:27:24.429 --> 04:27:24.439 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:27:27.429 --> 04:27:27.439 align:start position:0%
oops here we go so we can see that
 
04:27:30.070 --> 04:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
there's an really a disproportionate
 
04:27:33.670 --> 04:27:33.680 align:start position:0%
number of adjunct versus full-time
 
04:27:36.870 --> 04:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
faculty so full-time faculty are people
 
04:27:39.790 --> 04:27:39.800 align:start position:0%
who have additional responsibilities
 
04:27:42.389 --> 04:27:42.399 align:start position:0%
Beyond representative kill um we're not
 
04:27:44.870 --> 04:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
seeing the numbers we're seeing the file
 
04:27:48.070 --> 04:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
um uh oh oh okay wait you're not seeing
 
04:27:50.630 --> 04:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
the number okay see faculty numbers HP
 
04:27:54.910 --> 04:27:54.920 align:start position:0%
501 it just isn't open uh oh hold
 
04:27:59.550 --> 04:27:59.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:01.990 --> 04:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
open mine
 
04:28:04.229 --> 04:28:04.239 align:start position:0%
bad how's
 
04:28:07.149 --> 04:28:07.159 align:start position:0%
that uh let me get may do another screen
 
04:28:07.159 --> 04:28:14.429 align:start position:0%
that uh let me get may do another screen
share

04:28:14.429 --> 04:28:14.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:17.189 --> 04:28:17.199 align:start position:0%
sorry are we are we there
 
04:28:19.309 --> 04:28:19.319 align:start position:0%
now uh no it doesn't look like the
 
04:28:23.269 --> 04:28:23.279 align:start position:0%
screen has shared just yet okay but to
 
04:28:34.790 --> 04:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:34.800 --> 04:28:39.910 align:start position:0%
 
right

04:28:39.910 --> 04:28:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:41.910 --> 04:28:41.920 align:start position:0%
um are we there
 
04:28:44.790 --> 04:28:44.800 align:start position:0%
now uh yes we can see them thank you oh
 
04:28:47.269 --> 04:28:47.279 align:start position:0%
thank you okay
 
04:28:51.830 --> 04:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
so uh the the uh community college
 
04:28:54.149 --> 04:28:54.159 align:start position:0%
system and like other universities and
 
04:28:56.910 --> 04:28:56.920 align:start position:0%
schools of Higher Learning are relying
 
04:28:58.109 --> 04:28:58.119 align:start position:0%
heavily on
 
04:29:00.389 --> 04:29:00.399 align:start position:0%
adjunct uh in in part because they're
 
04:29:03.510 --> 04:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
cheaper uh they don't get benefits uh
 
04:29:05.189 --> 04:29:05.199 align:start position:0%
they're only paid when they teach if
 
04:29:07.229 --> 04:29:07.239 align:start position:0%
they're if they class is canceled due to
 
04:29:08.910 --> 04:29:08.920 align:start position:0%
short enrollment or something they don't
 
04:29:11.550 --> 04:29:11.560 align:start position:0%
get paid and they are paid substantially
 
04:29:14.309 --> 04:29:14.319 align:start position:0%
less than the full-time faculty so what
 
04:29:16.469 --> 04:29:16.479 align:start position:0%
we're asking what we're asking to do
 
04:29:19.830 --> 04:29:19.840 align:start position:0%
here is to is to pay them
 
04:29:22.750 --> 04:29:22.760 align:start position:0%
75% of what a full-time faculty member
 
04:29:26.750 --> 04:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
would receive for class time and we
 
04:29:27.910 --> 04:29:27.920 align:start position:0%
understanding that this would be you
 
04:29:29.670 --> 04:29:29.680 align:start position:0%
know a considerable expense but see
 
04:29:31.429 --> 04:29:31.439 align:start position:0%
here's what they're getting now the
 
04:29:34.510 --> 04:29:34.520 align:start position:0%
maximum an adjunct can earn is 836 per
 
04:29:39.349 --> 04:29:39.359 align:start position:0%
credit or 25 $258 for a three credit
 
04:29:42.790 --> 04:29:42.800 align:start position:0%
course and whereas the full-time
 
04:29:45.830 --> 04:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
teaching the same receives
 
04:29:50.030 --> 04:29:50.040 align:start position:0%
$2,354 oh sorry receives $3,300 per
 
04:29:51.910 --> 04:29:51.920 align:start position:0%
credit uh which is you know
 
04:29:54.349 --> 04:29:54.359 align:start position:0%
substantially more than the person doing
 
04:29:56.790 --> 04:29:56.800 align:start position:0%
the same work and we have students
 
04:29:58.309 --> 04:29:58.319 align:start position:0%
taking these classes and they're being
 
04:30:00.990 --> 04:30:01.000 align:start position:0%
taught you know by qualified people some
 
04:30:02.070 --> 04:30:02.080 align:start position:0%
of them with
 
04:30:05.790 --> 04:30:05.800 align:start position:0%
phds but um we we have a situation we we
 
04:30:07.710 --> 04:30:07.720 align:start position:0%
want to keep tuition low but it
 
04:30:09.550 --> 04:30:09.560 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be on the backs of the people
 
04:30:11.750 --> 04:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
providing the instruction so it's a it's
 
04:30:15.990 --> 04:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
a challenge indeed and uh we had people
 
04:30:17.510 --> 04:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
behind me other people who are more
 
04:30:19.030 --> 04:30:19.040 align:start position:0%
directly involved that may be able to
 
04:30:21.189 --> 04:30:21.199 align:start position:0%
answer better answer questions but you
 
04:30:24.550 --> 04:30:24.560 align:start position:0%

echo thank you representative kahill Mr
 
04:31:41.229 --> 04:31:41.239 align:start position:0%
chairman is it my understanding that um
 
04:31:43.910 --> 04:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
the University of New Hampshire system
 
04:31:46.189 --> 04:31:46.199 align:start position:0%
and the Community College systems there
 
04:31:50.469 --> 04:31:50.479 align:start position:0%
are professors in each one of those uh
 
04:31:54.469 --> 04:31:54.479 align:start position:0%
systems and adjunct or lecturers as I
 
04:31:58.269 --> 04:31:58.279 align:start position:0%
think UNH calls them and for each one of
 
04:32:00.309 --> 04:32:00.319 align:start position:0%
those groups there
 
04:32:03.710 --> 04:32:03.720 align:start position:0%
are uh Union collective bargaining
 
04:32:06.349 --> 04:32:06.359 align:start position:0%
agreements is that correct
 
04:32:08.030 --> 04:32:08.040 align:start position:0%
that is
 
04:32:10.269 --> 04:32:10.279 align:start position:0%
correct did he say correct um yeah he
 
04:32:13.109 --> 04:32:13.119 align:start position:0%
did say yes yes
 
04:32:15.670 --> 04:32:15.680 align:start position:0%
Paul uh if that is the
 
04:32:18.830 --> 04:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
case is is it your
 
04:32:20.910 --> 04:32:20.920 align:start position:0%
intention that the
 
04:32:25.950 --> 04:32:25.960 align:start position:0%
legislate the legislature puts into law
 
04:32:29.229 --> 04:32:29.239 align:start position:0%
something that has an immediate effect
 
04:32:31.389 --> 04:32:31.399 align:start position:0%
or a direct effect on collective
 
04:32:31.399 --> 04:32:32.910 align:start position:0%
or a direct effect on collective
bargaining

04:32:32.910 --> 04:32:32.920 align:start position:0%
bargaining
 
04:32:35.830 --> 04:32:35.840 align:start position:0%
agreements uh thank you for the question
 
04:32:38.030 --> 04:32:38.040 align:start position:0%
representative uh it is really because
 
04:32:40.590 --> 04:32:40.600 align:start position:0%
of the lack of the uh collective
 
04:32:43.670 --> 04:32:43.680 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreement to be to be uh
 
04:32:45.510 --> 04:32:45.520 align:start position:0%
negotiated uh that they're that they're
 
04:32:48.070 --> 04:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
falling upon deaf ears that that we're
 
04:32:51.030 --> 04:32:51.040 align:start position:0%
offering this bill uh because the you
 
04:32:53.510 --> 04:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
know with the system that's was created
 
04:32:56.149 --> 04:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
we delegated to the trustees go ahead
 
04:32:57.469 --> 04:32:57.479 align:start position:0%
and run this we don't know how to run a
 
04:32:59.790 --> 04:32:59.800 align:start position:0%
university just go ahead and run it but
 
04:33:01.590 --> 04:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
what we have here is a situation where
 
04:33:04.789 --> 04:33:04.799 align:start position:0%
people are being uh vastly underpaid for
 
04:33:08.189 --> 04:33:08.199 align:start position:0%
doing the same work and basically you
 
04:33:09.990 --> 04:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
know because they're an adjunct and not
 
04:33:13.429 --> 04:33:13.439 align:start position:0%
a full uh faculty member and in many
 
04:33:15.150 --> 04:33:15.160 align:start position:0%
other fields like the medical field for
 
04:33:17.750 --> 04:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
example if you're a medical technologist
 
04:33:19.910 --> 04:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
and you're working you know for a short
 
04:33:22.470 --> 04:33:22.480 align:start position:0%
term you're you're paid an hourly rate
 
04:33:24.949 --> 04:33:24.959 align:start position:0%
greater than that of the uh of your
 
04:33:27.750 --> 04:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
peers because you're attemp and you're
 
04:33:30.230 --> 04:33:30.240 align:start position:0%
not getting benefits so we have these
 
04:33:34.349 --> 04:33:34.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:34.359 --> 04:33:37.109 align:start position:0%
 
money

04:33:37.109 --> 04:33:37.119 align:start position:0%
money
 
04:33:40.750 --> 04:33:40.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman welcome any other
 
04:33:43.109 --> 04:33:43.119 align:start position:0%
questions representative Huff you're
 
04:33:46.750 --> 04:33:46.760 align:start position:0%
recognize for a question thank you Mr
 
04:33:46.760 --> 04:33:48.390 align:start position:0%
recognize for a question thank you Mr
chair

04:33:48.390 --> 04:33:48.400 align:start position:0%
chair
 
04:33:54.269 --> 04:33:54.279 align:start position:0%
um so is it my understanding or or not
 
04:33:58.310 --> 04:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
are the adjunct folks in the union or
 
04:33:59.551 --> 04:33:59.561 align:start position:0%
not in the
 
04:34:02.029 --> 04:34:02.039 align:start position:0%
unions thank you representative there
 
04:34:04.629 --> 04:34:04.639 align:start position:0%
are they have a union and the uh
 
04:34:07.109 --> 04:34:07.119 align:start position:0%
full-time have a separate Union they
 
04:34:07.119 --> 04:34:08.510 align:start position:0%
full-time have a separate Union they
separate

04:34:08.510 --> 04:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
separate
 
04:34:10.990 --> 04:34:11.000 align:start position:0%
cbas and
 
04:34:13.990 --> 04:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
um again it's uh they have they've been
 
04:34:16.150 --> 04:34:16.160 align:start position:0%
working without a contract and we will
 
04:34:19.150 --> 04:34:19.160 align:start position:0%
have a person from that Union uh lined

person I have on my list to speak is
 
04:36:11.310 --> 04:36:11.320 align:start position:0%
Trisha Todd tid tid Trisha
 
04:36:16.551 --> 04:36:16.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:19.230 --> 04:36:19.240 align:start position:0%
Trisha yes she
 
04:36:23.429 --> 04:36:23.439 align:start position:0%
is hi hi uh my name is Trish Ed uh I am
 
04:36:25.470 --> 04:36:25.480 align:start position:0%
an adjunct faculty member at Manchester
 
04:36:28.510 --> 04:36:28.520 align:start position:0%
Community College I teach anatomy and
 
04:36:31.949 --> 04:36:31.959 align:start position:0%
physiology um so the community college
 
04:36:33.789 --> 04:36:33.799 align:start position:0%
and the University of New Hampshire both
 
04:36:35.990 --> 04:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
of them are really important to our
 
04:36:38.551 --> 04:36:38.561 align:start position:0%
state and our citizens because they do
 
04:36:41.709 --> 04:36:41.719 align:start position:0%
give our citizens an affordable way to
 
04:36:43.269 --> 04:36:43.279 align:start position:0%
get higher
 
04:36:46.230 --> 04:36:46.240 align:start position:0%
education um one of the things about the
 
04:36:48.910 --> 04:36:48.920 align:start position:0%
community college system is that we have
 
04:36:51.189 --> 04:36:51.199 align:start position:0%
been in the last couple years really
 
04:36:55.230 --> 04:36:55.240 align:start position:0%
trying to make the courses equivalent to
 
04:36:57.029 --> 04:36:57.039 align:start position:0%
a four-year college so that students
 
04:36:59.830 --> 04:36:59.840 align:start position:0%
have a viable option to have a two plus
 
04:37:02.670 --> 04:37:02.680 align:start position:0%
two program where they can do that for
 
04:37:03.990 --> 04:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
an affordable
 
04:37:07.830 --> 04:37:07.840 align:start position:0%
price in doing that adjunct faculty has
 
04:37:10.670 --> 04:37:10.680 align:start position:0%
the same responsibility as full-time
 
04:37:14.470 --> 04:37:14.480 align:start position:0%
faculty we have the same availability to
 
04:37:16.709 --> 04:37:16.719 align:start position:0%
students we have the same requirements
 
04:37:19.429 --> 04:37:19.439 align:start position:0%
the same level of teaching um and we
 
04:37:21.789 --> 04:37:21.799 align:start position:0%
have the same educational
 
04:37:24.189 --> 04:37:24.199 align:start position:0%
requirements um as our
 
04:37:27.510 --> 04:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
full-time um
 
04:37:29.750 --> 04:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
equivalents but in addition to that a
 
04:37:32.750 --> 04:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
lot of the adjunct faculty bring Real
 
04:37:35.390 --> 04:37:35.400 align:start position:0%
World experience that brings a level of
 
04:37:39.670 --> 04:37:39.680 align:start position:0%
perspective diversity in Real World um
 
04:37:42.750 --> 04:37:42.760 align:start position:0%
actual work ethic into the community and
 
04:37:47.029 --> 04:37:47.039 align:start position:0%
and it enriches the the college um as
 
04:37:49.269 --> 04:37:49.279 align:start position:0%
well as our students making them more
 
04:37:51.230 --> 04:37:51.240 align:start position:0%
ready to enter the
 
04:37:53.551 --> 04:37:53.561 align:start position:0%
workforce as you can see there's a large
 
04:37:56.949 --> 04:37:56.959 align:start position:0%
number of adjunct faculty at um all of
 
04:37:58.429 --> 04:37:58.439 align:start position:0%
our community colleges I've taught at
 
04:38:00.189 --> 04:38:00.199 align:start position:0%
Manchester Community College I've also
 
04:38:02.869 --> 04:38:02.879 align:start position:0%
taught a couple classes at River
 
04:38:05.709 --> 04:38:05.719 align:start position:0%
Valley um we are members of that
 
04:38:07.910 --> 04:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
Community we know our students we know
 
04:38:09.990 --> 04:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
our fellow faculty members we attend
 
04:38:12.230 --> 04:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
faculty meetings we do all of the same
 
04:38:14.109 --> 04:38:14.119 align:start position:0%
things that our full-time faculty
 
04:38:16.709 --> 04:38:16.719 align:start position:0%
members do um but we're doing that for a
 
04:38:19.310 --> 04:38:19.320 align:start position:0%
fraction of the price
 
04:38:22.269 --> 04:38:22.279 align:start position:0%
um it still would be a cost a
 
04:38:22.279 --> 04:38:23.510 align:start position:0%
um it still would be a cost a
cost-saving

04:38:23.510 --> 04:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
cost-saving
 
04:38:27.990 --> 04:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
measure um even raising the per hour the
 
04:38:30.990 --> 04:38:31.000 align:start position:0%
per credit hour pay uh because you're
 
04:38:32.510 --> 04:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
only paying for the work that's actually
 
04:38:35.510 --> 04:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
done as opposed to a general salary
 
04:38:37.109 --> 04:38:37.119 align:start position:0%
um but there needs to be a minimum just
 
04:38:39.709 --> 04:38:39.719 align:start position:0%
like there's a minimum wage requirement
 
04:38:42.109 --> 04:38:42.119 align:start position:0%
I I I heard the beginning there were a
 
04:38:44.269 --> 04:38:44.279 align:start position:0%
couple questions about the union and
 
04:38:45.949 --> 04:38:45.959 align:start position:0%
about that collective
 
04:38:48.510 --> 04:38:48.520 align:start position:0%
bargaining as representative Cahill
 
04:38:50.470 --> 04:38:50.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned we haven't been really
 
04:38:52.750 --> 04:38:52.760 align:start position:0%
successful on that collective bargaining
 
04:38:55.189 --> 04:38:55.199 align:start position:0%
um like unlike some other unions that
 
04:38:58.109 --> 04:38:58.119 align:start position:0%
have that ability to to strike and to do
 
04:39:01.109 --> 04:39:01.119 align:start position:0%
other things we don't really have that
 
04:39:03.189 --> 04:39:03.199 align:start position:0%
um so it's just conversations going back
 
04:39:05.429 --> 04:39:05.439 align:start position:0%
and forth on that Collective bargain
 
04:39:09.510 --> 04:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
and I've been teaching as an adjunct
 
04:39:13.349 --> 04:39:13.359 align:start position:0%
for uh like over over six years now and
 
04:39:14.910 --> 04:39:14.920 align:start position:0%
I don't think I've ever worked under a
 
04:39:17.750 --> 04:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
current contract
 
04:39:20.510 --> 04:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
um we're back I think it's three or four
 
04:39:23.670 --> 04:39:23.680 align:start position:0%
years where the contracts are are being
 
04:39:25.830 --> 04:39:25.840 align:start position:0%
approved um so I actually have never
 
04:39:29.029 --> 04:39:29.039 align:start position:0%
worked under a contract um and that
 
04:39:30.510 --> 04:39:30.520 align:start position:0%
that's a little bit frustrating you know
 
04:39:34.269 --> 04:39:34.279 align:start position:0%
there's no um no stability um in the job
 
04:39:35.470 --> 04:39:35.480 align:start position:0%
and they're they're definitely could be
 
04:39:38.590 --> 04:39:38.600 align:start position:0%
a little bit more of that um so that's
 
04:39:41.230 --> 04:39:41.240 align:start position:0%
all that I have thank you for your
 
04:39:44.390 --> 04:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
time thank you tra any questions in the
 
04:39:47.390 --> 04:39:47.400 align:start position:0%
uh L for Trisha yes representative turot
 
04:39:49.948 --> 04:39:49.958 align:start position:0%
you're recognized for question thank you
 
04:39:52.310 --> 04:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you for the testimony
 
04:39:56.310 --> 04:39:56.320 align:start position:0%
uh Trisha uh couple questions uh are you
 
04:40:00.350 --> 04:40:00.360 align:start position:0%
a member of the whatever the Union uh I
 
04:40:02.270 --> 04:40:02.280 align:start position:0%
don't know the exact name of Union but
 
04:40:04.868 --> 04:40:04.878 align:start position:0%
are you a member of it and pay paying
 
04:40:08.150 --> 04:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
IND do to that Union Yes I am a member
 
04:40:14.270 --> 04:40:14.280 align:start position:0%
of that Union it's the sa um SEIU sea um
 
04:40:16.030 --> 04:40:16.040 align:start position:0%
we're at chapter
 
04:40:19.110 --> 04:40:19.120 align:start position:0%
32 follow up Mr chair follow
 
04:40:21.990 --> 04:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
up I'll ask you a variation of what I
 
04:40:23.910 --> 04:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
asked representative kahill why do you
 
04:40:27.390 --> 04:40:27.400 align:start position:0%
believe it's the legisl legislator's
 
04:40:30.910 --> 04:40:30.920 align:start position:0%
responsibility if you have a union and
 
04:40:33.708 --> 04:40:33.718 align:start position:0%
you pay dues to that Union why is it the
 
04:40:36.390 --> 04:40:36.400 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the legislature to
 
04:40:36.400 --> 04:40:37.510 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the legislature to
develop

04:40:37.510 --> 04:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
develop
 
04:40:41.070 --> 04:40:41.080 align:start position:0%
laws uh to solve a a section of your
 
04:40:43.070 --> 04:40:43.080 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining
 
04:40:45.110 --> 04:40:45.120 align:start position:0%
agreement okay thank you that's a great
 
04:40:48.430 --> 04:40:48.440 align:start position:0%
question um I see it more as kind of
 
04:40:51.510 --> 04:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
like having the federal minimum wage um
 
04:40:54.830 --> 04:40:54.840 align:start position:0%
that there needs to be a basement where
 
04:40:58.150 --> 04:40:58.160 align:start position:0%
we can then negotiate from um and right
 
04:41:00.830 --> 04:41:00.840 align:start position:0%
now the the basement isn't really there
 
04:41:02.310 --> 04:41:02.320 align:start position:0%
um as far as what they're they're
 
04:41:04.948 --> 04:41:04.958 align:start position:0%
talking about um and then you can also
 
04:41:07.708 --> 04:41:07.718 align:start position:0%
see the lack of success of what's been
 
04:41:10.430 --> 04:41:10.440 align:start position:0%
going on with those Communications um in
 
04:41:12.830 --> 04:41:12.840 align:start position:0%
the collective bargaining and I haven't
 
04:41:14.470 --> 04:41:14.480 align:start position:0%
been involved myself in the collective
 
04:41:16.390 --> 04:41:16.400 align:start position:0%
bargaining um I believe that there's
 
04:41:18.948 --> 04:41:18.958 align:start position:0%
another um another person who's going to
 
04:41:20.910 --> 04:41:20.920 align:start position:0%
be testifying Steve that that could
 
04:41:24.470 --> 04:41:24.480 align:start position:0%
probably talk better to to those
 
04:41:27.070 --> 04:41:27.080 align:start position:0%
specifics thank you representative
 
04:41:28.830 --> 04:41:28.840 align:start position:0%
Callum did I see your hand
 
04:41:30.868 --> 04:41:30.878 align:start position:0%

04:42:07.480 --> 04:42:09.190 align:start position:0%
 
union

04:42:09.190 --> 04:42:09.200 align:start position:0%
union
 
04:42:11.788 --> 04:42:11.798 align:start position:0%
and if
 
04:42:11.798 --> 04:42:13.470 align:start position:0%
and if
um

04:42:13.470 --> 04:42:13.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:18.510 --> 04:42:18.520 align:start position:0%
75% less than your
 
04:42:18.520 --> 04:42:21.110 align:start position:0%
75% less than your
regular

04:42:21.110 --> 04:42:21.120 align:start position:0%
regular
 
04:42:23.628 --> 04:42:23.638 align:start position:0%
instructors is a good
 
04:42:28.788 --> 04:42:28.798 align:start position:0%
number then that's 25% less
 
04:42:33.110 --> 04:42:33.120 align:start position:0%
than than regular employe
 
04:42:38.270 --> 04:42:38.280 align:start position:0%
employment why is is not 25% greater a a
 
04:42:38.280 --> 04:42:40.510 align:start position:0%
employment why is is not 25% greater a a
good

04:42:40.510 --> 04:42:40.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:45.470 --> 04:42:45.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:47.670 --> 04:42:47.680 align:start position:0%
number we'd always love to get more
 
04:42:50.070 --> 04:42:50.080 align:start position:0%
money right um but there are some
 
04:42:52.470 --> 04:42:52.480 align:start position:0%
differences between adjunct faculty and
 
04:42:55.750 --> 04:42:55.760 align:start position:0%
full-time faculty um adjunct faculty
 
04:43:00.190 --> 04:43:00.200 align:start position:0%
would have more um more time as far as
 
04:43:03.590 --> 04:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
the advising with students um adjunct
 
04:43:05.788 --> 04:43:05.798 align:start position:0%
faculty definitely do advising we have
 
04:43:07.750 --> 04:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
office hours we meet with students but
 
04:43:10.030 --> 04:43:10.040 align:start position:0%
adjunct uh full-time faculty have
 
04:43:12.390 --> 04:43:12.400 align:start position:0%
additional administrative duties and I
 
04:43:15.030 --> 04:43:15.040 align:start position:0%
believe that that would be the the
 
04:43:18.030 --> 04:43:18.040 align:start position:0%
difference thank you for you taking my
 
04:43:18.040 --> 04:43:19.590 align:start position:0%
difference thank you for you taking my
question

04:43:19.590 --> 04:43:19.600 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:43:21.390 --> 04:43:21.400 align:start position:0%
yeah for the
 
04:43:23.628 --> 04:43:23.638 align:start position:0%
speaker seeing n thank you very much for
 
04:43:27.230 --> 04:43:27.240 align:start position:0%

I see your I am here I am here you're
 
04:43:44.670 --> 04:43:44.680 align:start position:0%
recognized to speak thank you very much
 
04:43:48.070 --> 04:43:48.080 align:start position:0%
um I sent uh uh this testimony earlier
 
04:43:51.270 --> 04:43:51.280 align:start position:0%
today uh along with some data that I'll
 
04:43:53.788 --> 04:43:53.798 align:start position:0%
mention in the testimony um as well as
 
04:43:57.150 --> 04:43:57.160 align:start position:0%
some uh reports from uh other other
 
04:43:59.830 --> 04:43:59.840 align:start position:0%
organizations um that that I hope help
 
04:44:02.910 --> 04:44:02.920 align:start position:0%
fill in some of the the gaps here um but
 
04:44:04.150 --> 04:44:04.160 align:start position:0%
I'll just read from the statement and
 
04:44:05.750 --> 04:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
then hope uh answer any questions if
 
04:44:06.830 --> 04:44:06.840 align:start position:0%
there are
 
04:44:09.190 --> 04:44:09.200 align:start position:0%

documentation submitted to the committee
 
04:44:16.230 --> 04:44:16.240 align:start position:0%
prior to this hearing I provided
 
04:44:18.830 --> 04:44:18.840 align:start position:0%
research I conducted into adjunct wages
 
04:44:20.708 --> 04:44:20.718 align:start position:0%
and determinations across the university

501 which I support for the sake of full
 
04:44:47.350 --> 04:44:47.360 align:start position:0%
disclosure I would like to note that I
 
04:44:49.270 --> 04:44:49.280 align:start position:0%
currently employed as an adjunct in the
 
04:44:51.788 --> 04:44:51.798 align:start position:0%
education department at UNH and
 
04:44:54.470 --> 04:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
conducted the research described uh in
 
04:44:56.470 --> 04:44:56.480 align:start position:0%
in this testimony while funded to pursue
 
04:44:58.788 --> 04:44:58.798 align:start position:0%
my doctorate in the same department at
 
04:45:00.590 --> 04:45:00.600 align:start position:0%
the time I initiated that research uh
 
04:45:02.510 --> 04:45:02.520 align:start position:0%
into wages and determinations I was also
 
04:45:04.708 --> 04:45:04.718 align:start position:0%
serving as a non-voting graduate student
 
04:45:06.708 --> 04:45:06.718 align:start position:0%
representative to the university system
 
04:45:09.310 --> 04:45:09.320 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire Board of
 
04:45:12.070 --> 04:45:12.080 align:start position:0%
Trustees for my research I obtained
 
04:45:14.270 --> 04:45:14.280 align:start position:0%
adjunct wage data from academic year
 
04:45:17.030 --> 04:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
2018 and 19 for faculty at Granite State
 
04:45:19.070 --> 04:45:19.080 align:start position:0%
College Keen State College Plymouth
 
04:45:20.948 --> 04:45:20.958 align:start position:0%
State University and University of New
 
04:45:22.990 --> 04:45:23.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the data I received from the
 
04:45:25.270 --> 04:45:25.280 align:start position:0%
four institutions is not uniform but I
 
04:45:27.868 --> 04:45:27.878 align:start position:0%
created tables that provide comparable
 
04:45:30.110 --> 04:45:30.120 align:start position:0%
snapshots from that Academic Year in
 
04:45:32.150 --> 04:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
regard to average wages paid to faculty
 
04:45:34.470 --> 04:45:34.480 align:start position:0%
determined by the institutions to to be
 
04:45:37.590 --> 04:45:37.600 align:start position:0%
adjunct or part-time at an institution
 
04:45:39.310 --> 04:45:39.320 align:start position:0%
offering and this is for context at an
 
04:45:41.030 --> 04:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
institution offering four credit hour
 
04:45:44.110 --> 04:45:44.120 align:start position:0%
courses on average uh part-time is
 
04:45:45.550 --> 04:45:45.560 align:start position:0%
typically defined as no more than eight
 
04:45:47.550 --> 04:45:47.560 align:start position:0%
credit hours per term or semester or
 
04:45:49.990 --> 04:45:50.000 align:start position:0%
0.50 full-time
 
04:45:52.990 --> 04:45:53.000 align:start position:0%
equivalency um that is uh below the uh
 
04:45:55.670 --> 04:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
the the rate or the equivalency that
 
04:45:56.948 --> 04:45:56.958 align:start position:0%
would require
 
04:45:59.390 --> 04:45:59.400 align:start position:0%
benefits um the tables I provided do not
 
04:46:01.070 --> 04:46:01.080 align:start position:0%
of course reflect discussions about the
 
04:46:02.830 --> 04:46:02.840 align:start position:0%
data which included inquiry through
 
04:46:04.910 --> 04:46:04.920 align:start position:0%
offices of provosts and human resources
 
04:46:07.110 --> 04:46:07.120 align:start position:0%
at each of the four institutions as well
 
04:46:08.910 --> 04:46:08.920 align:start position:0%
as with staff in the offices of General
 
04:46:10.910 --> 04:46:10.920 align:start position:0%
Council and human resources at the
 
04:46:13.190 --> 04:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
University system of New Hampshire nor
 
04:46:14.750 --> 04:46:14.760 align:start position:0%
do they indicate the lack of resources
 
04:46:16.788 --> 04:46:16.798 align:start position:0%
at some component institutions devoted
 
04:46:18.030 --> 04:46:18.040 align:start position:0%
to the professional development of
 
04:46:21.030 --> 04:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
adjunct faculty um just for context
 
04:46:22.868 --> 04:46:22.878 align:start position:0%
again at UNH for instance there are
 
04:46:24.310 --> 04:46:24.320 align:start position:0%
plentiful examples of Faculty
 
04:46:26.430 --> 04:46:26.440 align:start position:0%
development programs described in
 
04:46:27.910 --> 04:46:27.920 align:start position:0%
materials posted to the pages of the
 
04:46:29.948 --> 04:46:29.958 align:start position:0%
office of the Provost and the office of
 
04:46:31.788 --> 04:46:31.798 align:start position:0%
Engagement and faculty development but
 
04:46:34.390 --> 04:46:34.400 align:start position:0%
few devoted or even available to adun
 
04:46:36.670 --> 04:46:36.680 align:start position:0%
faculty development of these faculty is
 
04:46:38.628 --> 04:46:38.638 align:start position:0%
largely left to departments themselves
 
04:46:40.430 --> 04:46:40.440 align:start position:0%
fighting for resources in a low
 
04:46:42.830 --> 04:46:42.840 align:start position:0%
Appropriations and therefore cost-saving
 
04:46:44.390 --> 04:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
and revenue seeking
 
04:46:46.430 --> 04:46:46.440 align:start position:0%
environment it is unclear whether the
 
04:46:48.190 --> 04:46:48.200 align:start position:0%
data from Plymouth State and Keen State
 
04:46:49.830 --> 04:46:49.840 align:start position:0%
include faculty covered by collective
 
04:46:51.990 --> 04:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreements in place uh and
 
04:46:53.590 --> 04:46:53.600 align:start position:0%
maybe I should pause for a moment here
 
04:46:57.230 --> 04:46:57.240 align:start position:0%
and say that uh the uh uh presence of
 
04:46:59.350 --> 04:46:59.360 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining agreements uh
 
04:47:00.910 --> 04:47:00.920 align:start position:0%
across the university system of New
 
04:47:03.350 --> 04:47:03.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is only in place for adjunct
 
04:47:06.310 --> 04:47:06.320 align:start position:0%
faculty at State and Keen State not at
 
04:47:09.230 --> 04:47:09.240 align:start position:0%
UNH and not at Granite State um unlike
 
04:47:10.868 --> 04:47:10.878 align:start position:0%
in the community college system of New
 
04:47:12.990 --> 04:47:13.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire which has a much broader uh
 
04:47:16.310 --> 04:47:16.320 align:start position:0%
coverage uh uh under Union um
 
04:47:17.990 --> 04:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
representation um so there's that
 
04:47:20.270 --> 04:47:20.280 align:start position:0%
stipulation at Keen the collective
 
04:47:22.070 --> 04:47:22.080 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreement stipulates that the
 
04:47:23.708 --> 04:47:23.718 align:start position:0%
adjunct faculty member becomes a member
 
04:47:25.750 --> 04:47:25.760 align:start position:0%
of the bargaining unit when he or she
 
04:47:28.150 --> 04:47:28.160 align:start position:0%
starts her his or her fifth semester of
 
04:47:30.990 --> 04:47:31.000 align:start position:0%
teaching um which is why uh I I I'm not
 
04:47:32.990 --> 04:47:33.000 align:start position:0%
sure if the data I received includes
 
04:47:35.190 --> 04:47:35.200 align:start position:0%
unionized or non unionized members or
 
04:47:37.270 --> 04:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
non-members uh similar situation at
 
04:47:38.670 --> 04:47:38.680 align:start position:0%
Plymouth uh they call them teaching
 
04:47:41.110 --> 04:47:41.120 align:start position:0%
lecturers but it's same situation there
 
04:47:43.350 --> 04:47:43.360 align:start position:0%
are folks who are covered by the CBA and
 
04:47:44.868 --> 04:47:44.878 align:start position:0%
folks who are not and I don't know if
 
04:47:47.110 --> 04:47:47.120 align:start position:0%
the data that I provided uh dis uh
 
04:47:48.788 --> 04:47:48.798 align:start position:0%
distinguishes between those different
 
04:47:51.030 --> 04:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
groups um adjuncts again at UNH in
 
04:47:52.990 --> 04:47:53.000 align:start position:0%
Granite State are not covered by any
 
04:47:56.030 --> 04:47:56.040 align:start position:0%
CBA um in any case I do not believe that
 
04:47:58.390 --> 04:47:58.400 align:start position:0%
any adjunct pay is tied to any of this
 
04:48:00.670 --> 04:48:00.680 align:start position:0%
internally available data so there are
 
04:48:03.270 --> 04:48:03.280 align:start position:0%
wage tables included in those uh
 
04:48:05.548 --> 04:48:05.558 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining agreements um I do
 
04:48:07.230 --> 04:48:07.240 align:start position:0%
not believe that at Plymouth for
 
04:48:10.628 --> 04:48:10.638 align:start position:0%
instance or Keen that uh the non-member
 
04:48:13.470 --> 04:48:13.480 align:start position:0%
adjunct wages are tied to this data or
 
04:48:15.270 --> 04:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
uh or these wage schedules which are
 
04:48:16.628 --> 04:48:16.638 align:start position:0%
negotiated in the
 
04:48:19.190 --> 04:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
contract in the end my findings lead to
 
04:48:20.270 --> 04:48:20.280 align:start position:0%
a conclusion that the wage
 
04:48:21.990 --> 04:48:22.000 align:start position:0%
determinations for adjunct faculty
 
04:48:24.670 --> 04:48:24.680 align:start position:0%
outside of CBA coverage are arbitrary
 
04:48:26.590 --> 04:48:26.600 align:start position:0%
and detached from any form of internal
 
04:48:28.708 --> 04:48:28.718 align:start position:0%
or external data such as an industry or
 
04:48:31.190 --> 04:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
market Standard or prevailing wages for
 
04:48:32.830 --> 04:48:32.840 align:start position:0%
full-time faculty in a teaching
 
04:48:35.430 --> 04:48:35.440 align:start position:0%
intensive appointments we heard uh just
 
04:48:37.150 --> 04:48:37.160 align:start position:0%
before uh the distinction between
 
04:48:39.910 --> 04:48:39.920 align:start position:0%
full-time faculty and part-time faculty
 
04:48:42.150 --> 04:48:42.160 align:start position:0%
um in the non- tene uh track uh
 
04:48:45.070 --> 04:48:45.080 align:start position:0%
full-time faculty uh appointment it's
 
04:48:46.628 --> 04:48:46.638 align:start position:0%
typically teaching intensive but with
 
04:48:47.948 --> 04:48:47.958 align:start position:0%
some service
 
04:48:51.628 --> 04:48:51.638 align:start position:0%
expectations um uh with a tenure track
 
04:48:53.788 --> 04:48:53.798 align:start position:0%
uh or tenure position there would also
 
04:48:55.750 --> 04:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
be research expectations so there is a
 
04:48:58.270 --> 04:48:58.280 align:start position:0%
distinction between full-time faculty uh
 
04:49:01.030 --> 04:49:01.040 align:start position:0%
who are tenured and those who are not to
 
04:49:03.390 --> 04:49:03.400 align:start position:0%
be fair to the institutions the reason
 
04:49:05.708 --> 04:49:05.718 align:start position:0%
for the of external data comparison is
 
04:49:08.070 --> 04:49:08.080 align:start position:0%
frankly quite simple there are no
 
04:49:09.990 --> 04:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
reliable or standardized data to which
 
04:49:11.948 --> 04:49:11.958 align:start position:0%
an institution may turn when determining
 
04:49:14.190 --> 04:49:14.200 align:start position:0%
adjunct faculty wages the integrated
 
04:49:16.548 --> 04:49:16.558 align:start position:0%
post-secondary Education data systems
 
04:49:17.830 --> 04:49:17.840 align:start position:0%
which is housed under the national
 
04:49:19.590 --> 04:49:19.600 align:start position:0%
Center for Education Sciences does not
 
04:49:21.910 --> 04:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
require reporting of adjunct wage data
 
04:49:23.350 --> 04:49:23.360 align:start position:0%
in the way that it requires reporting of
 
04:49:25.788 --> 04:49:25.798 align:start position:0%
wage data for full-time faculty on and
 
04:49:28.150 --> 04:49:28.160 align:start position:0%
off the 10e track uh this of course is
 
04:49:29.350 --> 04:49:29.360 align:start position:0%
beyond the remit of the New Hampshire
 
04:49:30.868 --> 04:49:30.878 align:start position:0%
general court because the statutes and
 
04:49:32.868 --> 04:49:32.878 align:start position:0%
policies that guide and require iPads
 
04:49:34.430 --> 04:49:34.440 align:start position:0%
reporting are functions and
 
04:49:36.470 --> 04:49:36.480 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of the US Senate house
 
04:49:38.830 --> 04:49:38.840 align:start position:0%
and department of education however it
 
04:49:40.390 --> 04:49:40.400 align:start position:0%
is within the remit of the New Hampshire
 
04:49:42.030 --> 04:49:42.040 align:start position:0%
General Court I believe to require
 
04:49:43.590 --> 04:49:43.600 align:start position:0%
regular and standardized reporting of
 
04:49:45.830 --> 04:49:45.840 align:start position:0%
wage data from the institutions within
 
04:49:47.788 --> 04:49:47.798 align:start position:0%
the public higher education systems
 
04:49:49.430 --> 04:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
including usnh and
 
04:49:52.110 --> 04:49:52.120 align:start position:0%
ccsnh regarding usnh there's language
 
04:49:53.510 --> 04:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
requiring the public higher education
 
04:49:55.708 --> 04:49:55.718 align:start position:0%
study committee to report annually on
 
04:49:57.548 --> 04:49:57.558 align:start position:0%
financing of public higher education and
 
04:49:59.628 --> 04:49:59.638 align:start position:0%
any other areas which will act as a
 
04:50:01.390 --> 04:50:01.400 align:start position:0%
guide to the legislature and trustees in
 
04:50:03.948 --> 04:50:03.958 align:start position:0%
formulating policies for the future
 
04:50:05.590 --> 04:50:05.600 align:start position:0%
regarding ccsnh there's language
 
04:50:07.470 --> 04:50:07.480 align:start position:0%
requiring annual reporting and review of
 
04:50:09.350 --> 04:50:09.360 align:start position:0%
system programs and costs as well as any
 
04:50:11.030 --> 04:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
other information detailed in the
 
04:50:11.040 --> 04:50:12.030 align:start position:0%
other information detailed in the
written

04:50:12.030 --> 04:50:12.040 align:start position:0%
written
 
04:50:15.190 --> 04:50:15.200 align:start position:0%
report turning to the language of HP 501
 
04:50:17.190 --> 04:50:17.200 align:start position:0%
I urge the following amendments uh I
 
04:50:18.788 --> 04:50:18.798 align:start position:0%
support the bill but I am offering some
 
04:50:21.230 --> 04:50:21.240 align:start position:0%
amendments um which are noted in red in
 
04:50:23.830 --> 04:50:23.840 align:start position:0%
the testimony I've provided um again
 
04:50:25.670 --> 04:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
this is uh making distinction between
 
04:50:27.990 --> 04:50:28.000 align:start position:0%
full-time faculty overall and full-time
 
04:50:29.948 --> 04:50:29.958 align:start position:0%
faculty on teaching intensive
 
04:50:31.230 --> 04:50:31.240 align:start position:0%
appointments because I think that's the
 
04:50:33.110 --> 04:50:33.120 align:start position:0%
appropriate comparison when talking
 
04:50:34.430 --> 04:50:34.440 align:start position:0%
about adjunct
 
04:50:37.510 --> 04:50:37.520 align:start position:0%
pay uh I won't read the the the actual
 
04:50:38.948 --> 04:50:38.958 align:start position:0%
language here but that's the main idea
 
04:50:40.470 --> 04:50:40.480 align:start position:0%
is I've added language that suggests
 
04:50:42.350 --> 04:50:42.360 align:start position:0%
that if we are going to say
 
04:50:45.590 --> 04:50:45.600 align:start position:0%
75% uh uh of the average salary of
 
04:50:47.150 --> 04:50:47.160 align:start position:0%
full-time faculty we should be speaking
 
04:50:48.750 --> 04:50:48.760 align:start position:0%
about full-time faculty with teaching
 
04:50:51.150 --> 04:50:51.160 align:start position:0%
intensive appointments um as that seems
 
04:50:54.670 --> 04:50:54.680 align:start position:0%
the most uh um reasonable comparison um
 
04:50:56.030 --> 04:50:56.040 align:start position:0%
I make that that suggestion for
 
04:50:59.830 --> 04:50:59.840 align:start position:0%
Amendment for both uh uh rsas for the US
 
04:51:03.830 --> 04:51:03.840 align:start position:0%
NH and ccsnh uh statutes um separate
 
04:51:05.670 --> 04:51:05.680 align:start position:0%
from the establishment of minimum salary
 
04:51:07.510 --> 04:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
requirements and perhaps this would
 
04:51:11.310 --> 04:51:11.320 align:start position:0%
require a separate bill I don't know um
 
04:51:13.150 --> 04:51:13.160 align:start position:0%
I would I would urge something uh along
 
04:51:14.628 --> 04:51:14.638 align:start position:0%
the lines of University and Community
 
04:51:16.948 --> 04:51:16.958 align:start position:0%
College systems faculty wage reporting
 
04:51:19.708 --> 04:51:19.718 align:start position:0%
for purposes of public accountability um
 
04:51:22.750 --> 04:51:22.760 align:start position:0%
and I would urge amendment of RSA 187a
 
04:51:25.470 --> 04:51:25.480 align:start position:0%
28c or other existing statutes to
 
04:51:27.070 --> 04:51:27.080 align:start position:0%
require regular and standardized
 
04:51:28.990 --> 04:51:29.000 align:start position:0%
reporting of all faculty and staff wages
 
04:51:31.788 --> 04:51:31.798 align:start position:0%
across usnh and I would recommend
 
04:51:34.310 --> 04:51:34.320 align:start position:0%
amending RSA 188 f11
 
04:51:36.350 --> 04:51:36.360 align:start position:0%
uh or other existing statutes to require
 
04:51:37.868 --> 04:51:37.878 align:start position:0%
regular and standardized reporting of
 
04:51:40.910 --> 04:51:40.920 align:start position:0%
all faculty and staff wages across
 
04:51:44.708 --> 04:51:44.718 align:start position:0%
ccsnh uh respectfully submitted uh my
 
04:51:46.788 --> 04:51:46.798 align:start position:0%
name is Jacob Bennett again representing
 
04:51:49.230 --> 04:51:49.240 align:start position:0%
myself happy to take any
 
04:51:51.430 --> 04:51:51.440 align:start position:0%
questions any
 
04:51:53.788 --> 04:51:53.798 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Mr Ben any questions
 
04:51:56.990 --> 04:51:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:59.270 --> 04:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
online seeing none questions of the
 
04:52:01.788 --> 04:52:01.798 align:start position:0%
members in the
 
04:52:04.830 --> 04:52:04.840 align:start position:0%
um uh in the hearing room I I see
 
04:52:06.548 --> 04:52:06.558 align:start position:0%
representative nun do you have a
 
04:52:09.470 --> 04:52:09.480 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman uh and
 
04:52:11.830 --> 04:52:11.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony uh I have a
 
04:52:13.750 --> 04:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
a sort of a specific question for you
 
04:52:18.750 --> 04:52:18.760 align:start position:0%
sir um sure uh all of all the adjunct
 
04:52:21.310 --> 04:52:21.320 align:start position:0%
faculty are part of collective
 
04:52:24.390 --> 04:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
bargaining unit uh and that unit is
 
04:52:27.190 --> 04:52:27.200 align:start position:0%
supported by a union in
 
04:52:30.150 --> 04:52:30.160 align:start position:0%
agreement um what steps have the members
 
04:52:31.788 --> 04:52:31.798 align:start position:0%
of the bargaining unit
 
04:52:35.110 --> 04:52:35.120 align:start position:0%
taken themselves to to alleviate this
 
04:52:38.948 --> 04:52:38.958 align:start position:0%
situation with the
 
04:52:42.830 --> 04:52:42.840 align:start position:0%
Union so I want to clarify again that
 
04:52:45.948 --> 04:52:45.958 align:start position:0%
um across the community college system
 
04:52:48.548 --> 04:52:48.558 align:start position:0%
uh of New Hampshire there are bargaining
 
04:52:50.750 --> 04:52:50.760 align:start position:0%
units for adjunct faculty I believe at
 
04:52:53.190 --> 04:52:53.200 align:start position:0%
every single campus across the
 
04:52:55.150 --> 04:52:55.160 align:start position:0%
university system of New Hampshire there
 
04:52:57.310 --> 04:52:57.320 align:start position:0%
are collective bargaining agreements in
 
04:52:59.868 --> 04:52:59.878 align:start position:0%
place covering adjuncts only at Kean
 
04:53:02.350 --> 04:53:02.360 align:start position:0%
State and at Plymouth State this is not
 
04:53:03.788 --> 04:53:03.798 align:start position:0%
the case at Granite State and this is
 
04:53:05.270 --> 04:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
not the case at
 
04:53:10.350 --> 04:53:10.360 align:start position:0%
UNH um to the to the question uh this is
 
04:53:13.470 --> 04:53:13.480 align:start position:0%
it so the question is uh have folks in
 
04:53:15.030 --> 04:53:15.040 align:start position:0%
these units I'm not in any of those
 
04:53:16.590 --> 04:53:16.600 align:start position:0%
units so I can't answer the question
 
04:53:18.590 --> 04:53:18.600 align:start position:0%
from experience but it seems like the
 
04:53:20.948 --> 04:53:20.958 align:start position:0%
question is why don't the unions do this
 
04:53:22.948 --> 04:53:22.958 align:start position:0%
why are you asking the legislature and I
 
04:53:24.990 --> 04:53:25.000 align:start position:0%
think that this has been answered in the
 
04:53:26.990 --> 04:53:27.000 align:start position:0%
in in this form which is that the
 
04:53:30.190 --> 04:53:30.200 align:start position:0%
existence of uh uh minimum wage does not
 
04:53:32.548 --> 04:53:32.558 align:start position:0%
preclude unions from bargaining over
 
04:53:35.510 --> 04:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
wages uh people who are in unions
 
04:53:38.310 --> 04:53:38.320 align:start position:0%
outside of an academic context are
 
04:53:41.708 --> 04:53:41.718 align:start position:0%
bargaining over wages and there is a a a
 
04:53:44.670 --> 04:53:44.680 align:start position:0%
federal mandate for a minimum wage so
 
04:53:48.430 --> 04:53:48.440 align:start position:0%
this law is not bizarre or anomalous in
 
04:53:50.190 --> 04:53:50.200 align:start position:0%
in in its request I
 
04:53:52.830 --> 04:53:52.840 align:start position:0%
think I I think that U may have followup
 
04:53:55.230 --> 04:53:55.240 align:start position:0%
sir follow up uh uh I think that you
 
04:53:57.270 --> 04:53:57.280 align:start position:0%
misunderstood my question I'm trying
 
04:53:59.948 --> 04:53:59.958 align:start position:0%
perhaps did I'm trying to get at the
 
04:54:02.470 --> 04:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
steps that the members of the bargaining
 
04:54:06.310 --> 04:54:06.320 align:start position:0%
unit what steps have they taken to try
 
04:54:11.590 --> 04:54:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:14.830 --> 04:54:14.840 align:start position:0%
me again I not in any I am an adjunct at
 
04:54:17.190 --> 04:54:17.200 align:start position:0%
UNH I do not belong to any of these
 
04:54:19.510 --> 04:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining units uh so I
 
04:54:21.190 --> 04:54:21.200 align:start position:0%
can't answer that question thank you
 
04:54:23.590 --> 04:54:23.600 align:start position:0%
very I believe that Steve B barill who
 
04:54:25.430 --> 04:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
is speaking after may be able to answer
 
04:54:27.750 --> 04:54:27.760 align:start position:0%
that I app I appreciate thank you very
 
04:54:30.030 --> 04:54:30.040 align:start position:0%
much thank you thank you I have a few
 
04:54:31.990 --> 04:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
more questions representative seaworth
 
04:54:34.830 --> 04:54:34.840 align:start position:0%
and then Tumi representative seaworth
 
04:54:41.310 --> 04:54:41.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:43.430 --> 04:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr
 
04:54:45.470 --> 04:54:45.480 align:start position:0%
chairman my
 
04:54:47.990 --> 04:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
question relates to something you just
 
04:54:52.310 --> 04:54:52.320 align:start position:0%
said in the previous response you made a
 
04:54:55.350 --> 04:54:55.360 align:start position:0%
comparison um
 
04:54:58.070 --> 04:54:58.080 align:start position:0%
between wages that are collectively
 
04:55:01.910 --> 04:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
bargained and the statutory minimum
 
04:55:03.910 --> 04:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
wage I am
 
04:55:07.430 --> 04:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
wondering if you are aware of
 
04:55:11.990 --> 04:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
other occupations or specific duties
 
04:55:14.310 --> 04:55:14.320 align:start position:0%
that have a minimum
 
04:55:19.510 --> 04:55:19.520 align:start position:0%
wage specified for them in state law so
 
04:55:24.548 --> 04:55:24.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:28.150 --> 04:55:28.160 align:start position:0%
employer are there other public employes
 
04:55:31.430 --> 04:55:31.440 align:start position:0%
that have minimum wages specified for
 
04:55:32.390 --> 04:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
them in
 
04:55:32.400 --> 04:55:33.948 align:start position:0%
them in
law

04:55:33.948 --> 04:55:33.958 align:start position:0%
law
 
04:55:35.910 --> 04:55:35.920 align:start position:0%
um not to my knowledge
 
04:55:38.708 --> 04:55:38.718 align:start position:0%
no but I also don't know of any other
 
04:55:41.270 --> 04:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
Industries in especially speaking in in
 
04:55:44.830 --> 04:55:44.840 align:start position:0%
a public context where profession
 
04:55:48.110 --> 04:55:48.120 align:start position:0%
professionals uh again many faculty have
 
04:55:51.150 --> 04:55:51.160 align:start position:0%
either a master's or a doctorate are
 
04:55:54.990 --> 04:55:55.000 align:start position:0%
paid at A Cut Rate to provide the same
 
04:55:57.190 --> 04:55:57.200 align:start position:0%
exact service that their peers who are
 
04:56:00.750 --> 04:56:00.760 align:start position:0%
on different contracts are paid so uh
 
04:56:04.510 --> 04:56:04.520 align:start position:0%
this this bill would seek to rec that I
 
04:56:06.990 --> 04:56:07.000 align:start position:0%
believe um regardless of whether there
 
04:56:09.310 --> 04:56:09.320 align:start position:0%
are other statutes in other places that
 
04:56:10.750 --> 04:56:10.760 align:start position:0%
do the same
 
04:56:12.590 --> 04:56:12.600 align:start position:0%
thing thank you I have two more
 
04:56:13.990 --> 04:56:14.000 align:start position:0%
questions for you representative Tumi
 
04:56:15.190 --> 04:56:15.200 align:start position:0%
and then representative berui
 
04:56:17.270 --> 04:56:17.280 align:start position:0%
representative Tumi you recognized for a
 
04:56:22.150 --> 04:56:22.160 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman uh um Mr
 
04:56:25.670 --> 04:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
Bennett uh a question about this is
 
04:56:27.910 --> 04:56:27.920 align:start position:0%
going to be a little bit tough because
 
04:56:30.070 --> 04:56:30.080 align:start position:0%
all courses are different I mean if
 
04:56:31.628 --> 04:56:31.638 align:start position:0%
you're teaching English you're teaching
 
04:56:35.708 --> 04:56:35.718 align:start position:0%
art it's quite different but uh I know
 
04:56:38.470 --> 04:56:38.480 align:start position:0%
that a Adjunct professor would have to
 
04:56:42.350 --> 04:56:42.360 align:start position:0%
create a course a syllabus would have to
 
04:56:45.190 --> 04:56:45.200 align:start position:0%
actually go to the class and and spend
 
04:56:47.470 --> 04:56:47.480 align:start position:0%
time with the students and would have to
 
04:56:51.750 --> 04:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
go home and then read uh you know
 
04:56:56.590 --> 04:56:56.600 align:start position:0%
material or or and create marks and and
 
04:56:59.628 --> 04:56:59.638 align:start position:0%
do administrated work how many hours
 
04:57:03.270 --> 04:57:03.280 align:start position:0%
does a would would a typical professor
 
04:57:07.430 --> 04:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:09.708 --> 04:57:09.718 align:start position:0%
course uh I don't know that I can answer
 
04:57:12.190 --> 04:57:12.200 align:start position:0%
that question I've taught uh first year
 
04:57:13.670 --> 04:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
writing courses and first year
 
04:57:14.910 --> 04:57:14.920 align:start position:0%
literature courses I've taught
 
04:57:16.548 --> 04:57:16.558 align:start position:0%
intermediate literature and writing
 
04:57:18.628 --> 04:57:18.638 align:start position:0%
courses I've taught graduate level
 
04:57:21.670 --> 04:57:21.680 align:start position:0%
education courses uh it depends on the
 
04:57:23.830 --> 04:57:23.840 align:start position:0%
number of students in the class it
 
04:57:26.470 --> 04:57:26.480 align:start position:0%
depends on the kinds of assignments that
 
04:57:28.868 --> 04:57:28.878 align:start position:0%
are uh that are given in the class which
 
04:57:31.270 --> 04:57:31.280 align:start position:0%
also depends on the subject and uh uh
 
04:57:34.270 --> 04:57:34.280 align:start position:0%
focus of the class um I don't I don't
 
04:57:35.990 --> 04:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
really have a good answer for that and
 
04:57:37.948 --> 04:57:37.958 align:start position:0%
it depends on the individual as well
 
04:57:39.390 --> 04:57:39.400 align:start position:0%
some people are slower readers and
 
04:57:42.430 --> 04:57:42.440 align:start position:0%
greaters than others um it's it's a hard
 
04:57:44.430 --> 04:57:44.440 align:start position:0%
question to answer I think yeah I know
 
04:57:46.390 --> 04:57:46.400 align:start position:0%
it would be a hard question thank you uh
 
04:57:49.868 --> 04:57:49.878 align:start position:0%
for for your attempt in answering
 
04:57:52.750 --> 04:57:52.760 align:start position:0%
surey you recognize representative
 
04:57:54.948 --> 04:57:54.958 align:start position:0%
Broody you recognize for a question uh
 
04:57:58.590 --> 04:57:58.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um are the adjunct
 
04:58:00.948 --> 04:58:00.958 align:start position:0%
people at UNH or Plymouth were they ever
 
04:58:05.708 --> 04:58:05.718 align:start position:0%
asked to join a union they ever have an
 
04:58:10.548 --> 04:58:10.558 align:start position:0%
election uh the adjuncts at UNH so I am
 
04:58:12.510 --> 04:58:12.520 align:start position:0%
uh I just started as an adjunct about
 
04:58:15.548 --> 04:58:15.558 align:start position:0%
two weeks ago or three weeks ago um I
 
04:58:17.270 --> 04:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
don't know whether there has been an
 
04:58:23.430 --> 04:58:23.440 align:start position:0%
attempt before uh uh January of 2021 I
 
04:58:25.470 --> 04:58:25.480 align:start position:0%
know that there is no Union uh for
 
04:58:31.670 --> 04:58:31.680 align:start position:0%
adjuncts at UNH um and so I wonder what
 
04:58:34.390 --> 04:58:34.400 align:start position:0%
the if the answer were yes I wonder what
 
04:58:37.510 --> 04:58:37.520 align:start position:0%
what the next question would
 
04:58:40.788 --> 04:58:40.798 align:start position:0%
be well if you were asked to join and
 
04:58:43.270 --> 04:58:43.280 align:start position:0%
and you're not a member probably had an
 
04:58:46.350 --> 04:58:46.360 align:start position:0%
election and voted not to
 
04:58:48.390 --> 04:58:48.400 align:start position:0%
join I don't believe there has been an
 
04:58:50.230 --> 04:58:50.240 align:start position:0%
election for any Union at UNH for
 
04:58:53.868 --> 04:58:53.878 align:start position:0%

Adent Union though I'm representing
 
05:00:11.990 --> 05:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
myself today teaching on average three

classes a semester one semester teaching
 
05:00:17.110 --> 05:00:17.120 align:start position:0%
beyond the credit hour cap for adun
 
05:00:19.788 --> 05:00:19.798 align:start position:0%
faculty and I signed a waver stating the
 
05:00:21.628 --> 05:00:21.638 align:start position:0%
overthe cap credit limit did not
 
05:00:23.788 --> 05:00:23.798 align:start position:0%
constitute an offer for a full-time
 
05:00:26.270 --> 05:00:26.280 align:start position:0%
position I'm not the only adject to
 
05:00:29.070 --> 05:00:29.080 align:start position:0%
assign a similar statement at Great Bay
 
05:00:32.990 --> 05:00:33.000 align:start position:0%
we have 34 full-time faculty roughly 200
 
05:00:35.788 --> 05:00:35.798 align:start position:0%
contingent I am part of that
 
05:00:38.708 --> 05:00:38.718 align:start position:0%
contingent today is February
 
05:00:41.270 --> 05:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
4th um I'm not going to pay rent until
 
05:00:43.750 --> 05:00:43.760 align:start position:0%
February 12th it was obviously due four
 
05:00:46.750 --> 05:00:46.760 align:start position:0%
days ago this is the same conversation I
 
05:00:49.510 --> 05:00:49.520 align:start position:0%
have with my landlord three times a year
 
05:00:52.510 --> 05:00:52.520 align:start position:0%
internet services cost me roughly un
 
05:00:55.548 --> 05:00:55.558 align:start position:0%
unreimbursed $150 a month this is a
 
05:00:57.670 --> 05:00:57.680 align:start position:0%
service I cannot do without because even
 
05:00:59.910 --> 05:00:59.920 align:start position:0%
before the pandemic I needed access to
 
05:01:02.590 --> 05:01:02.600 align:start position:0%
Student Records student assignments and
 
05:01:05.190 --> 05:01:05.200 align:start position:0%
email email on a daily basis and you can
 
05:01:07.150 --> 05:01:07.160 align:start position:0%
imagine now with the need for even
 
05:01:09.910 --> 05:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
zooier internet speeds the that bill is
 
05:01:12.510 --> 05:01:12.520 align:start position:0%
consistently paid late as
 
05:01:15.708 --> 05:01:15.718 align:start position:0%
well over the past five years I've been
 
05:01:18.350 --> 05:01:18.360 align:start position:0%
on food stamps heating assistance rent
 
05:01:20.350 --> 05:01:20.360 align:start position:0%
assistance have visited on multiple
 
05:01:23.070 --> 05:01:23.080 align:start position:0%
occasions the local food bank and I was
 
05:01:25.510 --> 05:01:25.520 align:start position:0%
informed when I first started I should
 
05:01:27.548 --> 05:01:27.558 align:start position:0%
simply consider those state and federal
 
05:01:30.590 --> 05:01:30.600 align:start position:0%
programs as a portion of my overall
 
05:01:33.190 --> 05:01:33.200 align:start position:0%
pay I own a car that is sat in the
 
05:01:35.070 --> 05:01:35.080 align:start position:0%
driveway for a year because I have not
 
05:01:37.948 --> 05:01:37.958 align:start position:0%
been able to afford the repairs my teeth
 
05:01:39.788 --> 05:01:39.798 align:start position:0%
are falling out of my mouth and I cannot
 
05:01:43.868 --> 05:01:43.878 align:start position:0%
afford to see a dentist I am one of
 
05:01:47.230 --> 05:01:47.240 align:start position:0%
hundreds I am consistently good at my
 
05:01:50.868 --> 05:01:50.878 align:start position:0%
job I serve on the faculty forum and
 
05:01:52.868 --> 05:01:52.878 align:start position:0%

05:01:55.430 --> 05:01:55.440 align:start position:0%
presidential search committee I've even
 
05:01:57.270 --> 05:01:57.280 align:start position:0%
been recently asked to speak at Great
 
05:01:59.270 --> 05:01:59.280 align:start position:0%

05:02:01.470 --> 05:02:01.480 align:start position:0%

sustainability as I said I am good at my
 
05:02:21.470 --> 05:02:21.480 align:start position:0%
job but I could be so much better if I
 
05:02:23.150 --> 05:02:23.160 align:start position:0%
was not worried about whether or not my
 
05:02:24.990 --> 05:02:25.000 align:start position:0%
landlord will one day simply throw us
 
05:02:26.548 --> 05:02:26.558 align:start position:0%
out onto the
 
05:02:29.230 --> 05:02:29.240 align:start position:0%

05:02:30.910 --> 05:02:30.920 align:start position:0%
between three to four colleges all

Workforce in 2015 the state restored

$5.5 million to the ccsnh budget and in
 
05:02:51.230 --> 05:02:51.240 align:start position:0%
spite of the money laid off faculty they
 
05:02:53.190 --> 05:02:53.200 align:start position:0%

05:03:06.670 --> 05:03:06.680 align:start position:0%
were again

layoffs the Investments New Hampshire
 
05:03:10.350 --> 05:03:10.360 align:start position:0%
continues to make in our community

college system are not really paying off
 
05:03:15.390 --> 05:03:15.400 align:start position:0%
how much longer do you think the 34

full-time falcony at Great Bay will
 
05:03:20.030 --> 05:03:20.040 align:start position:0%
survive as full-time how long must they
 
05:03:22.670 --> 05:03:22.680 align:start position:0%
wait for another round of layoffs and
 
05:03:25.990 --> 05:03:26.000 align:start position:0%

badly underpaying professionals is
 
05:03:39.948 --> 05:03:39.958 align:start position:0%
industrial foolishness and budgetarily
 
05:03:39.958 --> 05:03:41.670 align:start position:0%
industrial foolishness and budgetarily
short-sided

05:03:41.670 --> 05:03:41.680 align:start position:0%
short-sided
 
05:03:43.990 --> 05:03:44.000 align:start position:0%
however this demonstrated by other
 
05:03:46.510 --> 05:03:46.520 align:start position:0%
schools such as Texas Tech who have
 
05:03:49.590 --> 05:03:49.600 align:start position:0%
reversed their Reliance upon the adjunct
 
05:03:51.470 --> 05:03:51.480 align:start position:0%
by creating higher quality employment
 
05:03:53.670 --> 05:03:53.680 align:start position:0%
for falcony you guarantee increased
 
05:03:56.788 --> 05:03:56.798 align:start position:0%

State Workforce and a state population
 
05:04:03.110 --> 05:04:03.120 align:start position:0%
with more resources HB 501 which I'm and
 
05:04:05.390 --> 05:04:05.400 align:start position:0%
support of in my opinion is only the
 
05:04:05.400 --> 05:04:06.510 align:start position:0%
support of in my opinion is only the
first

05:04:06.510 --> 05:04:06.520 align:start position:0%
first
 
05:04:09.230 --> 05:04:09.240 align:start position:0%
step at the very least the bill will
 
05:04:12.830 --> 05:04:12.840 align:start position:0%
assure a modum of budgetary oversight it
 
05:04:14.548 --> 05:04:14.558 align:start position:0%
will at the very minimum allow teachers
 
05:04:16.788 --> 05:04:16.798 align:start position:0%
to focus on students not whether they
 
05:04:19.310 --> 05:04:19.320 align:start position:0%

05:04:50.310 --> 05:04:50.320 align:start position:0%
organize um so I joined the union in in
 
05:04:52.548 --> 05:04:52.558 align:start position:0%
2019 January of
 
05:04:56.270 --> 05:04:56.280 align:start position:0%
2019 and um the next thing I did was
 
05:04:59.190 --> 05:04:59.200 align:start position:0%
become president uh there was kind of an
 
05:05:01.310 --> 05:05:01.320 align:start position:0%
election but nobody ran against me so it
 
05:05:04.548 --> 05:05:04.558 align:start position:0%
was kind of a default and I joined the
 
05:05:06.948 --> 05:05:06.958 align:start position:0%
negotiation team at that point in time
 
05:05:08.470 --> 05:05:08.480 align:start position:0%
there was only one person on the
 
05:05:08.480 --> 05:05:10.070 align:start position:0%
there was only one person on the
negotiation

05:05:10.070 --> 05:05:10.080 align:start position:0%
negotiation
 
05:05:13.750 --> 05:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
team um I had tried to bring other
 
05:05:16.150 --> 05:05:16.160 align:start position:0%
members into the
 
05:05:19.470 --> 05:05:19.480 align:start position:0%
negotiation um and that worked up to a
 
05:05:21.110 --> 05:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
point and now I think we're down to
 
05:05:23.430 --> 05:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
about two two people on the negotiation
 
05:05:28.310 --> 05:05:28.320 align:start position:0%
team and that's me and I think um one
 
05:05:31.030 --> 05:05:31.040 align:start position:0%
other person um but not the original
 
05:05:32.910 --> 05:05:32.920 align:start position:0%
person that began because he was he was
 
05:05:35.628 --> 05:05:35.638 align:start position:0%
currently his uh contract was not
 
05:05:35.638 --> 05:05:38.708 align:start position:0%
currently his uh contract was not
renewed

05:05:38.708 --> 05:05:38.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:43.350 --> 05:05:43.360 align:start position:0%
um we I have um tried to Institute a
 
05:05:46.708 --> 05:05:46.718 align:start position:0%
monthly Zoom meeting which I have had
 
05:05:51.190 --> 05:05:51.200 align:start position:0%
issues with uh getting technology or
 
05:05:54.230 --> 05:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
people having notification about it with
 
05:05:57.510 --> 05:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
emails um so that has been kind of sort
 
05:05:59.510 --> 05:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
of successful to bring more people into
 
05:05:59.520 --> 05:06:00.470 align:start position:0%
of successful to bring more people into
the

05:06:00.470 --> 05:06:00.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:06:04.110 --> 05:06:04.120 align:start position:0%
fold I will say that myself and this is
 
05:06:06.230 --> 05:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
speaking personally and not as a
 
05:06:09.030 --> 05:06:09.040 align:start position:0%
representative of sea chapter 32 myself
 
05:06:10.788 --> 05:06:10.798 align:start position:0%
and a few others have started looking at
 
05:06:13.150 --> 05:06:13.160 align:start position:0%
ibw the International Brotherhood of
 
05:06:13.160 --> 05:06:14.150 align:start position:0%
ibw the International Brotherhood of
Electrical

05:06:14.150 --> 05:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
Electrical
 
05:06:16.548 --> 05:06:16.558 align:start position:0%
Workers that is the union the full-time
 
05:06:19.548 --> 05:06:19.558 align:start position:0%
falculty is with and a couple of the
 
05:06:21.430 --> 05:06:21.440 align:start position:0%
full-time falculty have actually
 
05:06:25.390 --> 05:06:25.400 align:start position:0%
expressed interest in combining our two
 
05:06:28.708 --> 05:06:28.718 align:start position:0%
unions so hopefully um that will be a
 
05:06:30.868 --> 05:06:30.878 align:start position:0%
step in that
 
05:06:33.868 --> 05:06:33.878 align:start position:0%
direction we have sea has a wonderful
 
05:06:38.390 --> 05:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
lawyer I cannot um talk about him more
 
05:06:39.788 --> 05:06:39.798 align:start position:0%
than than
 
05:06:43.030 --> 05:06:43.040 align:start position:0%
accolades um Jake has has done us a
 
05:06:46.150 --> 05:06:46.160 align:start position:0%
wonderful job but uh the negotiating
 
05:06:48.430 --> 05:06:48.440 align:start position:0%
meetings have have kind of turned
 
05:06:52.270 --> 05:06:52.280 align:start position:0%
stalemate I have watched um lawyers
 
05:06:54.150 --> 05:06:54.160 align:start position:0%
almost tear up I never thought I'd ever
 
05:06:57.270 --> 05:06:57.280 align:start position:0%
see a lawyer tear up and nobody's
 
05:07:00.030 --> 05:07:00.040 align:start position:0%
talking to each other it is a total
 
05:07:02.628 --> 05:07:02.638 align:start position:0%
total stalemate and we need to change
 
05:07:02.638 --> 05:07:05.310 align:start position:0%
total stalemate and we need to change
the

05:07:05.310 --> 05:07:05.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:07.070 --> 05:07:07.080 align:start position:0%
conversation so I don't know if that
 
05:07:08.830 --> 05:07:08.840 align:start position:0%

and now we have Tom Cronin who has
 
05:07:50.708 --> 05:07:50.718 align:start position:0%

just before I start I know I SED up a
 
05:08:02.590 --> 05:08:02.600 align:start position:0%
little late I believe the community
 
05:08:05.070 --> 05:08:05.080 align:start position:0%
college system um and interim Chancellor
 
05:08:08.390 --> 05:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
Susan Huard were planning to testify um
 
05:08:10.390 --> 05:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
if that's the case and Susan is on the
 
05:08:12.590 --> 05:08:12.600 align:start position:0%
line I would if if okay by you Mr
 
05:08:14.910 --> 05:08:14.920 align:start position:0%

05:08:16.910 --> 05:08:16.920 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to go and and she can jump in
 
05:08:18.788 --> 05:08:18.798 align:start position:0%

05:08:20.948 --> 05:08:20.958 align:start position:0%
my knowledge you can go ahead okay
 
05:08:22.590 --> 05:08:22.600 align:start position:0%
perfect in that case um I'll be very
 
05:08:24.390 --> 05:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
quick uh again my name is Tom Cronin
 
05:08:25.750 --> 05:08:25.760 align:start position:0%
director of government relations for the
 
05:08:27.830 --> 05:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
University system um the university
 
05:08:30.830 --> 05:08:30.840 align:start position:0%
system is opposed to 501 uh HP 501 and
 
05:08:33.110 --> 05:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
I've submitted some written testimony
 
05:08:34.990 --> 05:08:35.000 align:start position:0%
to that effect but simply wanted to
 
05:08:36.750 --> 05:08:36.760 align:start position:0%
emphasize three quick points in that
 
05:08:38.590 --> 05:08:38.600 align:start position:0%
testimony first as has already been
 
05:08:40.070 --> 05:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
discussed the legislature has
 
05:08:42.190 --> 05:08:42.200 align:start position:0%
established wages as a mandatory subject
 
05:08:44.750 --> 05:08:44.760 align:start position:0%
of bargaining and for the unionized
 
05:08:46.510 --> 05:08:46.520 align:start position:0%
adjunct faculty across the system we
 
05:08:48.030 --> 05:08:48.040 align:start position:0%
believe the bargaining table is the
 
05:08:49.548 --> 05:08:49.558 align:start position:0%
appropriate place for these
 
05:08:51.548 --> 05:08:51.558 align:start position:0%
conversations um as discussed however
 
05:08:52.948 --> 05:08:52.958 align:start position:0%
there are a number of adun Faculty who
 
05:08:55.310 --> 05:08:55.320 align:start position:0%
are not unionized um and in that case
 
05:08:57.230 --> 05:08:57.240 align:start position:0%
really a more suitable wage comparison
 
05:08:59.070 --> 05:08:59.080 align:start position:0%
would be adjunct faculty teaching
 
05:09:01.868 --> 05:09:01.878 align:start position:0%
similar courses at PE peer institutions
 
05:09:03.430 --> 05:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
AC Ross New England and across the
 
05:09:06.628 --> 05:09:06.638 align:start position:0%
country um in which in those cases
 
05:09:08.390 --> 05:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
really per credit rates are driven by
 
05:09:10.788 --> 05:09:10.798 align:start position:0%
market factors including demand and
 
05:09:13.628 --> 05:09:13.638 align:start position:0%
professional experience in the field um
 
05:09:15.948 --> 05:09:15.958 align:start position:0%
second we're concerned that as HB 501 is
 
05:09:17.788 --> 05:09:17.798 align:start position:0%
drafted it would be incredibly difficult
 
05:09:20.310 --> 05:09:20.320 align:start position:0%
to administer um there's no single
 
05:09:22.390 --> 05:09:22.400 align:start position:0%
credit hour wage paid to full-time
 
05:09:24.708 --> 05:09:24.718 align:start position:0%
faculty um at our universities
 
05:09:25.990 --> 05:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
individuals teaching in different
 
05:09:28.110 --> 05:09:28.120 align:start position:0%
disciplines and differ experiences and
 
05:09:29.948 --> 05:09:29.958 align:start position:0%
qualifications are compensated
 
05:09:31.190 --> 05:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
differently based on those
 
05:09:31.200 --> 05:09:33.110 align:start position:0%
differently based on those
qualifications

05:09:33.110 --> 05:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
qualifications
 
05:09:35.310 --> 05:09:35.320 align:start position:0%
uh and finally I think as conceded you
 
05:09:36.830 --> 05:09:36.840 align:start position:0%
know at different times during this
 
05:09:38.990 --> 05:09:39.000 align:start position:0%
conversation we're certainly concerned
 
05:09:41.948 --> 05:09:41.958 align:start position:0%
that you know creating uh this wage
 
05:09:43.750 --> 05:09:43.760 align:start position:0%
level would without a doubt have
 
05:09:46.270 --> 05:09:46.280 align:start position:0%
long-term impacts on our cost to educate
 
05:09:48.470 --> 05:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
our students um so with that said again
 
05:09:49.910 --> 05:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
I've submitted written testimony with
 
05:09:51.470 --> 05:09:51.480 align:start position:0%
some further information but we be happy
 
05:09:54.030 --> 05:09:54.040 align:start position:0%
to take any
 
05:09:56.230 --> 05:09:56.240 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Tom any questions
 
05:10:01.030 --> 05:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:03.548 --> 05:10:03.558 align:start position:0%
online see n oh y I do see one
 
05:10:05.030 --> 05:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan you recognize
 
05:10:06.628 --> 05:10:06.638 align:start position:0%

05:10:09.470 --> 05:10:09.480 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr

chairman um I assume you heard the the
 
05:10:15.390 --> 05:10:15.400 align:start position:0%
testimony of the prior um uh
 
05:10:20.590 --> 05:10:20.600 align:start position:0%
witness um do you find his um
 
05:10:23.910 --> 05:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
uh assertion that he's basically living
 
05:10:29.070 --> 05:10:29.080 align:start position:0%
in poverty to be um a believable and uh
 
05:10:29.080 --> 05:10:31.030 align:start position:0%
in poverty to be um a believable and uh
B

05:10:31.030 --> 05:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
B
 
05:10:34.390 --> 05:10:34.400 align:start position:0%
acceptable uh I did hear the PRI prior
 
05:10:37.510 --> 05:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
testimony um I will say I I I do not
 
05:10:39.548 --> 05:10:39.558 align:start position:0%
have the the experience that that he has
 
05:10:41.628 --> 05:10:41.638 align:start position:0%
spoken of or I don't have firsthand
 
05:10:42.830 --> 05:10:42.840 align:start position:0%
knowledge of the experience he's spoken
 
05:10:44.830 --> 05:10:44.840 align:start position:0%
of in terms of dealing with um kind of
 
05:10:47.030 --> 05:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
the ongoing Union negotiations my
 
05:10:48.628 --> 05:10:48.638 align:start position:0%
understanding is he is uh community
 
05:10:52.270 --> 05:10:52.280 align:start position:0%
college system um adjunct faculty or or
 
05:10:54.670 --> 05:10:54.680 align:start position:0%
part of their Union again I I do think
 
05:10:55.830 --> 05:10:55.840 align:start position:0%
at least she's trying to get on

501 um I am Susan Huard I'm the interim
 
05:11:59.470 --> 05:11:59.480 align:start position:0%
Chancellor of the community college
 
05:12:02.548 --> 05:12:02.558 align:start position:0%
system uh before taking on this role
 
05:12:04.628 --> 05:12:04.638 align:start position:0%
little less than a year ago I was the
 
05:12:06.230 --> 05:12:06.240 align:start position:0%
president of Manchester Community
 
05:12:09.030 --> 05:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
College for 10 years and I tried to
 
05:12:11.190 --> 05:12:11.200 align:start position:0%
retire at the end of that decade but I'm
 
05:12:12.628 --> 05:12:12.638 align:start position:0%
learning in New Hampshire you never
 
05:12:14.788 --> 05:12:14.798 align:start position:0%
really get to uh retire if there's an
 
05:12:17.270 --> 05:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity to serve and so I'm back as
 
05:12:18.830 --> 05:12:18.840 align:start position:0%
the chancellor until the permanent
 
05:12:21.628 --> 05:12:21.638 align:start position:0%
Chancellor is hired hopefully by the 1
 
05:12:24.548 --> 05:12:24.558 align:start position:0%
of July I mention my background because
 
05:12:26.628 --> 05:12:26.638 align:start position:0%
I come uh before you today having not
 
05:12:28.390 --> 05:12:28.400 align:start position:0%
only been a Chancellor and a college
 
05:12:30.548 --> 05:12:30.558 align:start position:0%
President I've been an adjunct faculty
 
05:12:33.150 --> 05:12:33.160 align:start position:0%
member a full-time faculty member and
 
05:12:34.670 --> 05:12:34.680 align:start position:0%
I've taught within middle school and
 
05:12:36.628 --> 05:12:36.638 align:start position:0%
high school and I I tell you this just
 
05:12:38.750 --> 05:12:38.760 align:start position:0%
to indicate the depth of my
 
05:12:41.310 --> 05:12:41.320 align:start position:0%
understanding about the situation we are
 
05:12:43.470 --> 05:12:43.480 align:start position:0%
in I have three points that I would like
 
05:12:46.350 --> 05:12:46.360 align:start position:0%
to make about this bill first uh
 
05:12:48.670 --> 05:12:48.680 align:start position:0%
compensation is a mandatory topic of
 
05:12:50.590 --> 05:12:50.600 align:start position:0%
bargaining and should not be in the
 
05:12:53.670 --> 05:12:53.680 align:start position:0%
legislative Arena uh secondly the
 
05:12:55.590 --> 05:12:55.600 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation would create a
 
05:12:58.708 --> 05:12:58.718 align:start position:0%
financially unsustainable situation and
 
05:13:02.310 --> 05:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
third the provision itself is unworkable
 
05:13:05.948 --> 05:13:05.958 align:start position:0%
um to briefly explain each point I'd
 
05:13:08.910 --> 05:13:08.920 align:start position:0%
like to uh outline for you how ccsnh is
 
05:13:11.030 --> 05:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
organized from an employee grouping
 
05:13:13.470 --> 05:13:13.480 align:start position:0%
standpoint there are seven colleges
 
05:13:16.390 --> 05:13:16.400 align:start position:0%
within the system but we are one single
 
05:13:18.788 --> 05:13:18.798 align:start position:0%
employer we have three distinct
 
05:13:21.190 --> 05:13:21.200 align:start position:0%
bargaining units one for full-time
 
05:13:24.110 --> 05:13:24.120 align:start position:0%
faculty one for staff and a third for
 
05:13:27.510 --> 05:13:27.520 align:start position:0%
adjunct faculty uh the sea is the
 
05:13:29.230 --> 05:13:29.240 align:start position:0%
exclusive bargaining representative of
 
05:13:31.788 --> 05:13:31.798 align:start position:0%
the adjunct faculty and the staff
 
05:13:33.310 --> 05:13:33.320 align:start position:0%
bargaining units and the full-time
 
05:13:35.470 --> 05:13:35.480 align:start position:0%
faculty as you heard earlier is
 
05:13:37.190 --> 05:13:37.200 align:start position:0%
represented by the New Hampshire higher
 
05:13:40.150 --> 05:13:40.160 align:start position:0%
education Union which is a segment of
 
05:13:44.390 --> 05:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
the IBEW Local uh
 
05:13:47.230 --> 05:13:47.240 align:start position:0%
2320 as a public employer the process
 
05:13:50.070 --> 05:13:50.080 align:start position:0%
for collective bargaining is prescribed
 
05:13:53.350 --> 05:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
and governed by New Hampshire RSA
 
05:13:56.910 --> 05:13:56.920 align:start position:0%
273a persuant to 273a it is the
 
05:13:59.750 --> 05:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
obligation of the public employer and
 
05:14:01.948 --> 05:14:01.958 align:start position:0%
the employee organization certified as
 
05:14:04.470 --> 05:14:04.480 align:start position:0%
the exclusive bargaining representative
 
05:14:06.548 --> 05:14:06.558 align:start position:0%
to negotiate in good faith on the terms
 
05:14:09.510 --> 05:14:09.520 align:start position:0%
and conditions of employment uh as
 
05:14:11.430 --> 05:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
defined the terms and conditions of
 
05:14:14.110 --> 05:14:14.120 align:start position:0%
employment mean wages hours and other
 
05:14:16.750 --> 05:14:16.760 align:start position:0%
conditions thus wages are a mandatory
 
05:14:19.270 --> 05:14:19.280 align:start position:0%
subject of bargaining and one bargain on
 
05:14:21.030 --> 05:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
behalf of covered employees through an
 
05:14:23.230 --> 05:14:23.240 align:start position:0%
exclusive bargaining
 
05:14:25.270 --> 05:14:25.280 align:start position:0%
representative it also defines the
 
05:14:27.350 --> 05:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
bargaining process for both parties
 
05:14:30.310 --> 05:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
management and the union if good faith
 
05:14:31.948 --> 05:14:31.958 align:start position:0%
bargaining does not result in in an
 
05:14:34.670 --> 05:14:34.680 align:start position:0%
agreement the next prescribed step is
 
05:14:37.548 --> 05:14:37.558 align:start position:0%
mediation if the mediation fails to
 
05:14:40.548 --> 05:14:40.558 align:start position:0%
result in agreement the process moves to
 
05:14:43.670 --> 05:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
non-binding fact finding bringing
 
05:14:45.430 --> 05:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
elements from bargaining into the
 
05:14:48.310 --> 05:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
legislative Arena by either party is not
 
05:14:50.150 --> 05:14:50.160 align:start position:0%
the intent of the collective bargaining
 
05:14:52.750 --> 05:14:52.760 align:start position:0%
process that has been laid out for us
 
05:14:54.990 --> 05:14:55.000 align:start position:0%
the legislation before you circumvents
 
05:14:58.110 --> 05:14:58.120 align:start position:0%
the established bargaining process it
 
05:15:00.430 --> 05:15:00.440 align:start position:0%
also if passed would establish a
 
05:15:03.150 --> 05:15:03.160 align:start position:0%
mechanism that would allow either party
 
05:15:05.750 --> 05:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
Union or management to engage in the
 
05:15:07.670 --> 05:15:07.680 align:start position:0%
legislative process for items not
 
05:15:09.868 --> 05:15:09.878 align:start position:0%
achieved through the bargaining
 
05:15:12.830 --> 05:15:12.840 align:start position:0%
process seems that creating a revolving
 
05:15:15.230 --> 05:15:15.240 align:start position:0%
door of bargaining parties coming before
 
05:15:16.830 --> 05:15:16.840 align:start position:0%
you seeking ends that they did not
 
05:15:19.350 --> 05:15:19.360 align:start position:0%
achieve in the context of a bilateral
 
05:15:21.470 --> 05:15:21.480 align:start position:0%
and thorough bargaining process
 
05:15:22.750 --> 05:15:22.760 align:start position:0%
undermines the
 
05:15:26.070 --> 05:15:26.080 align:start position:0%
legisl well as the bargaining process
 
05:15:28.310 --> 05:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
moreover compensation is one Element
 
05:15:30.548 --> 05:15:30.558 align:start position:0%
among many that are typically balanced
 
05:15:30.558 --> 05:15:40.788 align:start position:0%
among many that are typically balanced
among

05:15:40.788 --> 05:15:40.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:40.798 --> 05:15:41.750 align:start position:0%
 
uh

05:15:41.750 --> 05:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:15:44.310 --> 05:15:44.320 align:start position:0%
secondly on the topic of this being
 
05:15:44.320 --> 05:15:45.910 align:start position:0%
secondly on the topic of this being
financially

05:15:45.910 --> 05:15:45.920 align:start position:0%
financially
 
05:15:48.190 --> 05:15:48.200 align:start position:0%
unsustainable I want to begin by saying
 
05:15:49.990 --> 05:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
that we deeply value and respect the
 
05:15:52.910 --> 05:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
role of A Faculty fairness and
 
05:15:56.310 --> 05:15:56.320 align:start position:0%
compensation is obviously our goal so is
 
05:15:56.320 --> 05:15:58.470 align:start position:0%
compensation is obviously our goal so is
organizational

05:15:58.470 --> 05:15:58.480 align:start position:0%
organizational
 
05:16:00.868 --> 05:16:00.878 align:start position:0%
sustainability I've work in other states
 
05:16:03.628 --> 05:16:03.638 align:start position:0%
and I literally have seen situations
 
05:16:05.708 --> 05:16:05.718 align:start position:0%
where College systems put themselves out
 
05:16:09.788 --> 05:16:09.798 align:start position:0%
of business because of contract element
 
05:16:12.430 --> 05:16:12.440 align:start position:0%
un sustainable and I am concerned this
 
05:16:15.590 --> 05:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
isn't a finan bill perhaps it would not
 
05:16:18.750 --> 05:16:18.760 align:start position:0%
in itself have a direct impact on state
 
05:16:20.708 --> 05:16:20.718 align:start position:0%
of course it would have a considerable
 
05:16:20.718 --> 05:16:26.430 align:start position:0%
of course it would have a considerable
fin

05:16:26.430 --> 05:16:26.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:29.548 --> 05:16:29.558 align:start position:0%
impa good everyone there you go go ahead
 
05:16:31.868 --> 05:16:31.878 align:start position:0%
Susan it would be a difficult one to
 
05:16:34.070 --> 05:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
calculate since there's so many value uh
 
05:16:37.070 --> 05:16:37.080 align:start position:0%
variables ultimately increased costs
 
05:16:39.110 --> 05:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
would be borne by the state and by the
 
05:16:42.070 --> 05:16:42.080 align:start position:0%
students affordability which is our
 
05:16:44.868 --> 05:16:44.878 align:start position:0%
Central Mission would cease and this
 
05:16:47.708 --> 05:16:47.718 align:start position:0%
bill leads to that scenario or a
 
05:16:49.590 --> 05:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
significant jump in
 
05:16:52.708 --> 05:16:52.718 align:start position:0%
appropriation I also fear what the
 
05:16:54.788 --> 05:16:54.798 align:start position:0%
adverse effects are that this bill would
 
05:16:57.590 --> 05:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
have on our students Beyond
 
05:16:59.628 --> 05:16:59.638 align:start position:0%
affordability it would certainly affect
 
05:17:01.708 --> 05:17:01.718 align:start position:0%
how many instructors of any kind that we
 
05:17:04.510 --> 05:17:04.520 align:start position:0%
can hire it would diminish our
 
05:17:06.868 --> 05:17:06.878 align:start position:0%
flexibility in developing and offering
 
05:17:09.150 --> 05:17:09.160 align:start position:0%
courses and it would be particularly
 
05:17:11.788 --> 05:17:11.798 align:start position:0%
harmful to our technical programs and
 
05:17:13.230 --> 05:17:13.240 align:start position:0%
that would be a real loss for our
 
05:17:14.948 --> 05:17:14.958 align:start position:0%
students because they benefit from
 
05:17:17.590 --> 05:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
working with professionals that are
 
05:17:19.430 --> 05:17:19.440 align:start position:0%
teaching them and they benefit from
 
05:17:22.390 --> 05:17:22.400 align:start position:0%
small classes and flexible offerings in
 
05:17:25.190 --> 05:17:25.200 align:start position:0%
terms of time so I ask you to be very
 
05:17:27.750 --> 05:17:27.760 align:start position:0%
cautious about this bill for these two
 
05:17:29.948 --> 05:17:29.958 align:start position:0%
reasons first because the matter does
 
05:17:32.708 --> 05:17:32.718 align:start position:0%
not belong in the legisl of Arena and
 
05:17:35.030 --> 05:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
secondly because it is
 
05:17:37.830 --> 05:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
unsustainable finally to comment on the
 
05:17:39.708 --> 05:17:39.718 align:start position:0%
specifics of HB
 
05:17:42.670 --> 05:17:42.680 align:start position:0%
51 stipulates that compensation will be
 
05:17:45.830 --> 05:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
based on 75% of the salary received by
 
05:17:49.230 --> 05:17:49.240 align:start position:0%
full-time faculty is calculated on a per
 
05:17:50.548 --> 05:17:50.558 align:start position:0%
credit hour
 
05:17:53.948 --> 05:17:53.958 align:start position:0%
basis first of all we don't determine a
 
05:17:56.390 --> 05:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
full-time faculty salary based on a per
 
05:17:59.310 --> 05:17:59.320 align:start position:0%
credit basis the salary received by a
 
05:18:00.868 --> 05:18:00.878 align:start position:0%
full-time faculty is based on a
 
05:18:03.788 --> 05:18:03.798 align:start position:0%
full-time workload which includes both
 
05:18:05.868 --> 05:18:05.878 align:start position:0%
instructional and non-instructional
 
05:18:09.510 --> 05:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
duties some of which you've heard um
 
05:18:12.190 --> 05:18:12.200 align:start position:0%
additionally uh Beyond preparing
 
05:18:14.910 --> 05:18:14.920 align:start position:0%
courses uh our full-time faculty develop
 
05:18:16.788 --> 05:18:16.798 align:start position:0%
curriculum they are the connection to
 
05:18:19.030 --> 05:18:19.040 align:start position:0%
Industry they are the people who are
 
05:18:21.628 --> 05:18:21.638 align:start position:0%
supporting and seeking specialty
 
05:18:24.150 --> 05:18:24.160 align:start position:0%
accreditations that bring high quality
 
05:18:26.030 --> 05:18:26.040 align:start position:0%
to our programs they are student
 
05:18:29.030 --> 05:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
advisers and mentors and while I
 
05:18:31.310 --> 05:18:31.320 align:start position:0%
thoroughly appreciate one of our pre
 
05:18:33.150 --> 05:18:33.160 align:start position:0%
previous speakers who talked about
 
05:18:33.160 --> 05:18:34.628 align:start position:0%
previous speakers who talked about
mentoring

05:18:34.628 --> 05:18:34.638 align:start position:0%
mentoring
 
05:18:37.470 --> 05:18:37.480 align:start position:0%
students it's not something that we ask
 
05:18:40.548 --> 05:18:40.558 align:start position:0%
our uh adun faculty to do I truly
 
05:18:42.750 --> 05:18:42.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate that some of our faculty
 
05:18:45.390 --> 05:18:45.400 align:start position:0%
engaged that way one of the challenges
 
05:18:47.270 --> 05:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
for me to speak about when I speak about
 
05:18:50.510 --> 05:18:50.520 align:start position:0%
our adjunct faculty is the diversity and
 
05:18:54.270 --> 05:18:54.280 align:start position:0%
the range we have people such as Steve
 
05:18:56.830 --> 05:18:56.840 align:start position:0%
who spoke for whom this is their primary
 
05:19:00.070 --> 05:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
means of uh making a living we have
 
05:19:02.510 --> 05:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
people who have taught previously and
 
05:19:05.510 --> 05:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
they supplement their retirement through
 
05:19:07.990 --> 05:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
working as adjunct faculty and we have
 
05:19:10.390 --> 05:19:10.400 align:start position:0%
members of Industry who take it upon
 
05:19:13.150 --> 05:19:13.160 align:start position:0%
themselves to help to educate the next
 
05:19:14.708 --> 05:19:14.718 align:start position:0%
group of workers that are going to come
 
05:19:16.070 --> 05:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
into their
 
05:19:16.080 --> 05:19:17.948 align:start position:0%
into their
professions

05:19:17.948 --> 05:19:17.958 align:start position:0%
professions
 
05:19:20.868 --> 05:19:20.878 align:start position:0%
uh the closest comparison that we can
 
05:19:23.310 --> 05:19:23.320 align:start position:0%
make in terms of pay for full-time
 
05:19:25.430 --> 05:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
faculty that's comparable to adjunct
 
05:19:28.910 --> 05:19:28.920 align:start position:0%
faculty is what we call overload so if a
 
05:19:31.830 --> 05:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
full-time faculty member
 
05:19:34.548 --> 05:19:34.558 align:start position:0%
is teaching a course beyond what we've
 
05:19:36.628 --> 05:19:36.638 align:start position:0%
uh asked as their regular
 
05:19:38.868 --> 05:19:38.878 align:start position:0%
load it turns out that their
 
05:19:42.030 --> 05:19:42.040 align:start position:0%
compensation for that overload course is
 
05:19:45.750 --> 05:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
actually slightly less than what we pay
 
05:19:49.350 --> 05:19:49.360 align:start position:0%
our adjunct faculty and I have um two
 
05:19:52.230 --> 05:19:52.240 align:start position:0%
examples for you um if an adjunct
 
05:19:54.708 --> 05:19:54.718 align:start position:0%
faculty member is teaching a basic
 
05:19:57.628 --> 05:19:57.638 align:start position:0%
accounting course he or she is going to
 
05:19:59.110 --> 05:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
make about
 
05:20:02.030 --> 05:20:02.040 align:start position:0%
2500 if our full-time faculty is doing
 
05:20:04.470 --> 05:20:04.480 align:start position:0%
it as an overload they're going to make
 
05:20:04.480 --> 05:20:05.830 align:start position:0%
it as an overload they're going to make
about

05:20:05.830 --> 05:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:20:08.510 --> 05:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
2,200 I could also use anatomy and
 
05:20:11.430 --> 05:20:11.440 align:start position:0%
physiology as an example an adjunct is
 
05:20:13.708 --> 05:20:13.718 align:start position:0%
going to make uh a bit less than
 
05:20:16.390 --> 05:20:16.400 align:start position:0%
4500 our full-time faculty member is
 
05:20:19.868 --> 05:20:19.878 align:start position:0%
going to make about 3,800 for the same
 
05:20:22.270 --> 05:20:22.280 align:start position:0%
course and I say that's the the fair
 
05:20:25.750 --> 05:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
comparator because while some adun
 
05:20:28.788 --> 05:20:28.798 align:start position:0%
faculty develop syllabuses at many of
 
05:20:32.390 --> 05:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
our colleges it is the full-time faculty
 
05:20:35.868 --> 05:20:35.878 align:start position:0%
who are developing the course outcomes
 
05:20:38.390 --> 05:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
the syllabus template they're
 
05:20:41.430 --> 05:20:41.440 align:start position:0%
identifying the textbook they are doing
 
05:20:44.110 --> 05:20:44.120 align:start position:0%
a lot of the work and we're then Hiring
 
05:20:47.628 --> 05:20:47.638 align:start position:0%
Our agent faculty in to uh teach within
 
05:20:47.638 --> 05:20:49.030 align:start position:0%
Our agent faculty in to uh teach within
that

05:20:49.030 --> 05:20:49.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:20:52.110 --> 05:20:52.120 align:start position:0%
framework so I thank you uh for your
 
05:20:56.310 --> 05:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
kind attention uh ccsn does not support
 
05:20:59.150 --> 05:20:59.160 align:start position:0%
this legislation but at the same time I
 
05:21:02.030 --> 05:21:02.040 align:start position:0%
want to be clear that we very much value
 
05:21:04.788 --> 05:21:04.798 align:start position:0%
all of our employees our faculty
 
05:21:08.110 --> 05:21:08.120 align:start position:0%
part-time and full-time and our staff I
 
05:21:10.230 --> 05:21:10.240 align:start position:0%
thank you so much thank you for your
 
05:21:12.510 --> 05:21:12.520 align:start position:0%
testimony any questions of any members
 
05:21:14.110 --> 05:21:14.120 align:start position:0%
in the committee
 
05:21:16.548 --> 05:21:16.558 align:start position:0%
room seeing none any questions of the
 
05:21:19.150 --> 05:21:19.160 align:start position:0%
members online representative Sullivan
 
05:21:22.548 --> 05:21:22.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:24.510 --> 05:21:24.520 align:start position:0%
question can't hear you representative
 
05:21:29.230 --> 05:21:29.240 align:start position:0%
Sullivan sorry thank you Mr chairman um
 
05:21:32.590 --> 05:21:32.600 align:start position:0%
Miss Huard um I'd like to um pose the
 
05:21:34.350 --> 05:21:34.360 align:start position:0%
same question to you that I did to the
 
05:21:39.708 --> 05:21:39.718 align:start position:0%
previous um uh witness uh do you
 
05:21:44.230 --> 05:21:44.240 align:start position:0%
find the state of uh virtually poverty
 
05:21:46.430 --> 05:21:46.440 align:start position:0%
that your adjuncts are some of them are
 
05:21:48.868 --> 05:21:48.878 align:start position:0%
living in do you find it uh believable
 
05:21:51.948 --> 05:21:51.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:54.430 --> 05:21:54.440 align:start position:0%
acceptable representative Sullivan I I
 
05:21:57.150 --> 05:21:57.160 align:start position:0%
certainly believe what um our adun
 
05:22:00.628 --> 05:22:00.638 align:start position:0%
faculty member has said but as I was and
 
05:22:02.990 --> 05:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
so I believe what he is saying about his
 
05:22:03.000 --> 05:22:04.390 align:start position:0%
so I believe what he is saying about his
personal

05:22:04.390 --> 05:22:04.400 align:start position:0%
personal
 
05:22:06.788 --> 05:22:06.798 align:start position:0%
circumstance and there may be other
 
05:22:09.110 --> 05:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
adjunct faculty in that circumstance but
 
05:22:11.548 --> 05:22:11.558 align:start position:0%
it is not a description of the
 
05:22:15.110 --> 05:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
circumstance of all of our adjunct
 
05:22:18.070 --> 05:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
faculty and
 
05:22:21.510 --> 05:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
um it's hard for me to comment on the
 
05:22:23.150 --> 05:22:23.160 align:start position:0%
second piece of it do I find it
 
05:22:25.230 --> 05:22:25.240 align:start position:0%
acceptable I would like everyone I mean
 
05:22:27.070 --> 05:22:27.080 align:start position:0%
the the core mission of the community
 
05:22:30.548 --> 05:22:30.558 align:start position:0%
college is to help people to find uh
 
05:22:30.558 --> 05:22:31.470 align:start position:0%
college is to help people to find uh
satis

05:22:31.470 --> 05:22:31.480 align:start position:0%
satis
 
05:22:36.470 --> 05:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
spying uh you know jobs and make uh
 
05:22:36.480 --> 05:22:37.510 align:start position:0%
spying uh you know jobs and make uh
adequate

05:22:37.510 --> 05:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
adequate
 
05:22:37.520 --> 05:22:39.070 align:start position:0%
adequate
salaries

05:22:39.070 --> 05:22:39.080 align:start position:0%
salaries
 
05:22:43.110 --> 05:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
um so my comment would be that I I wish
 
05:22:45.470 --> 05:22:45.480 align:start position:0%
the same for this aun
 
05:22:49.510 --> 05:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
faculty but if you take the situation as
 
05:22:51.548 --> 05:22:51.558 align:start position:0%
they've described it
 
05:22:55.070 --> 05:22:55.080 align:start position:0%
now um uh the if I say the average
 
05:22:57.990 --> 05:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
facult Adent faculty within our system
 
05:23:00.628 --> 05:23:00.638 align:start position:0%
teaches two courses a semester and I I
 
05:23:00.638 --> 05:23:01.390 align:start position:0%
teaches two courses a semester and I I
heard

05:23:01.390 --> 05:23:01.400 align:start position:0%
heard
 
05:23:07.430 --> 05:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
what Mr barill said um by this uh by
 
05:23:10.350 --> 05:23:10.360 align:start position:0%
their suggestion we would be talking if
 
05:23:12.150 --> 05:23:12.160 align:start position:0%
if an adjunct taught two classes in the
 
05:23:14.030 --> 05:23:14.040 align:start position:0%
fall two classes in the spring and one
 
05:23:17.110 --> 05:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
in the summer I'm now actually exceeding
 
05:23:19.910 --> 05:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
the salary of a full-time faculty
 
05:23:22.948 --> 05:23:22.958 align:start position:0%
member and we just don't have that
 
05:23:25.110 --> 05:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
Financial capacity we're in a place
 
05:23:28.390 --> 05:23:28.400 align:start position:0%
where if I think about our students 67%
 
05:23:32.990 --> 05:23:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:35.830 --> 05:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
when we raised tuition a few years ago
 
05:23:39.350 --> 05:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
by $10 we saw a decline in enrollment
 
05:23:41.628 --> 05:23:41.638 align:start position:0%
and we heard because we did surveys from
 
05:23:43.788 --> 05:23:43.798 align:start position:0%
students very clearly that they were
 
05:23:43.798 --> 05:23:44.750 align:start position:0%
students very clearly that they were
maxed

05:23:44.750 --> 05:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
maxed
 
05:23:48.070 --> 05:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
out uh New Hampshire has either the
 
05:23:50.628 --> 05:23:50.638 align:start position:0%
highest uh Community College tuition in
 
05:23:53.110 --> 05:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
the country or the second highest so
 
05:23:55.990 --> 05:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
balancing all of these factors I have to
 
05:23:59.230 --> 05:23:59.240 align:start position:0%
think about our students as well as uh
 
05:24:04.430 --> 05:24:04.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:05.868 --> 05:24:05.878 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Tumi you
 
05:24:08.548 --> 05:24:08.558 align:start position:0%
recognize for a question yeah thank you
 
05:24:10.948 --> 05:24:10.958 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
05:24:14.390 --> 05:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
uh thanks for your testimony uh I just
 
05:24:17.948 --> 05:24:17.958 align:start position:0%
wondered what does a let's say a
 
05:24:22.708 --> 05:24:22.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:26.270 --> 05:24:26.280 align:start position:0%
annually um it depends
 
05:24:29.470 --> 05:24:29.480 align:start position:0%
upon whether the person is an instructor
 
05:24:31.628 --> 05:24:31.638 align:start position:0%
an assistant or an associate see
 
05:24:36.150 --> 05:24:36.160 align:start position:0%
it give me just a moment I
 
05:24:40.510 --> 05:24:40.520 align:start position:0%
um our salaries range from about
 
05:24:44.990 --> 05:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
45,000 to a little over a 100,000 uh
 
05:24:48.910 --> 05:24:48.920 align:start position:0%
across the uh profor at ranks what would
 
05:24:52.708 --> 05:24:52.718 align:start position:0%
an average oh I'm sorry followup Mr

chairman hello right follow up thank you
 
05:25:00.788 --> 05:25:00.798 align:start position:0%
um what would be the average salary of a
 
05:25:02.868 --> 05:25:02.878 align:start position:0%
a professor that's been teaching for
 
05:25:05.470 --> 05:25:05.480 align:start position:0%
like seven or eight years okay someone
 
05:25:07.150 --> 05:25:07.160 align:start position:0%
who was teaching for seven or eight
 
05:25:08.990 --> 05:25:09.000 align:start position:0%
years would

Bennett

05:26:01.470 --> 05:26:01.480 align:start position:0%
Bennett
 
05:26:03.830 --> 05:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
representative Horgan you're recognized
 
05:26:03.840 --> 05:26:05.788 align:start position:0%
representative Horgan you're recognized

05:26:08.390 --> 05:26:08.400 align:start position:0%
speak oh thank you very much I'll I'll
 
05:26:10.310 --> 05:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
be I'll be brief I
 
05:26:13.910 --> 05:26:13.920 align:start position:0%
actually actually was just going to uh
 
05:26:16.910 --> 05:26:16.920 align:start position:0%
reason I decided to decided to log on I
 
05:26:19.270 --> 05:26:19.280 align:start position:0%
apologize for like logging on belatedly
 
05:26:21.670 --> 05:26:21.680 align:start position:0%
was because I I think I pulled down the
 
05:26:24.990 --> 05:26:25.000 align:start position:0%
wrong option on the uh on the new the
 
05:26:27.150 --> 05:26:27.160 align:start position:0%
new whizbang uh form so I was planning
 
05:26:29.030 --> 05:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
not to express an opinion one way or the
 
05:26:31.628 --> 05:26:31.638 align:start position:0%
other on it um but um
 
05:26:33.270 --> 05:26:33.280 align:start position:0%
very strongly in favor of the other two
 
05:26:34.590 --> 05:26:34.600 align:start position:0%
bills you're hearing at one o'clock and
 
05:26:36.830 --> 05:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
I'm very strongly in favor of paying
 
05:26:39.910 --> 05:26:39.920 align:start position:0%
people more so um especially including
 
05:26:42.830 --> 05:26:42.840 align:start position:0%
ad chunk faculty professors but I think
 
05:26:46.788 --> 05:26:46.798 align:start position:0%
this bill um this bill is written um
 
05:26:49.030 --> 05:26:49.040 align:start position:0%
Bill's written has many flaws so I I
 
05:26:51.590 --> 05:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
agree with uh you know Mr Cronin from
 
05:26:54.548 --> 05:26:54.558 align:start position:0%
University system and U Chancellor hward
 
05:26:57.390 --> 05:26:57.400 align:start position:0%
that uh this would the existing
 
05:27:00.868 --> 05:27:00.878 align:start position:0%
of our of our excellent um our excellent
 
05:27:02.868 --> 05:27:02.878 align:start position:0%
public higher education things course
 
05:27:05.030 --> 05:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
they probably probably something room
 
05:27:06.830 --> 05:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
will probably hear that like that the
 
05:27:08.628 --> 05:27:08.638 align:start position:0%
university system and Community College
 
05:27:10.470 --> 05:27:10.480 align:start position:0%
system ha might think oh this must have
 
05:27:12.750 --> 05:27:12.760 align:start position:0%
something to it but no it's uh it's the
 
05:27:15.070 --> 05:27:15.080 align:start position:0%
intention is good but the idea is
 
05:27:18.270 --> 05:27:18.280 align:start position:0%
written is unrealistic and also having
 
05:27:21.708 --> 05:27:21.718 align:start position:0%
75% of the average uh salary is
 
05:27:23.590 --> 05:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
problematic first of all because um
 
05:27:25.990 --> 05:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
full-time professors do a lot of work um
 
05:27:28.310 --> 05:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
you know outside the classroom and and
 
05:27:30.310 --> 05:27:30.320 align:start position:0%
actually unfortunately as do ad junks
 
05:27:32.310 --> 05:27:32.320 align:start position:0%
but um there in fact there's some
 
05:27:35.350 --> 05:27:35.360 align:start position:0%
members of The Faculty who contribute
 
05:27:37.230 --> 05:27:37.240 align:start position:0%
mightily to University and Community
 
05:27:39.310 --> 05:27:39.320 align:start position:0%
College system who do little of any
 
05:27:42.910 --> 05:27:42.920 align:start position:0%
teaching in the classroom but also um
 
05:27:48.510 --> 05:27:48.520 align:start position:0%
also it's also like the top um top uh
 
05:27:50.590 --> 05:27:50.600 align:start position:0%
top professors you know there's some who
 
05:27:53.150 --> 05:27:53.160 align:start position:0%
are Superstar professors you know who
 
05:27:56.708 --> 05:27:56.718 align:start position:0%
bring in lots of you know who uh make
 
05:27:58.548 --> 05:27:58.558 align:start position:0%
very high salaries and you can say
 
05:28:00.150 --> 05:28:00.160 align:start position:0%
whether or not that's fair or unfair but
 
05:28:02.150 --> 05:28:02.160 align:start position:0%
there are are some of those and most of
 
05:28:03.830 --> 05:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
them bring in uh many of them often
 
05:28:05.270 --> 05:28:05.280 align:start position:0%
bring in a lot of revenue from from
 
05:28:08.150 --> 05:28:08.160 align:start position:0%
other sources so that's uh so I
 
05:28:09.628 --> 05:28:09.638 align:start position:0%
certainly think the idea of paying Ed
 
05:28:11.270 --> 05:28:11.280 align:start position:0%
junk professors more is a good one in
 
05:28:12.628 --> 05:28:12.638 align:start position:0%
principle and we should be paying
 
05:28:14.830 --> 05:28:14.840 align:start position:0%
everyone a lot more than they are um
 
05:28:16.590 --> 05:28:16.600 align:start position:0%
probably including us you know maybe
 
05:28:18.670 --> 05:28:18.680 align:start position:0%
they should give us a raise to $125 a
 
05:28:21.150 --> 05:28:21.160 align:start position:0%
year or something but that's uh I'm in
 
05:28:23.030 --> 05:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
favor of high wages in general including
 
05:28:25.110 --> 05:28:25.120 align:start position:0%
the adjunct professors by I I sort of
 
05:28:27.310 --> 05:28:27.320 align:start position:0%
feel this bill is not workable and um if
 
05:28:29.948 --> 05:28:29.958 align:start position:0%
I if I navigated the form correctly I
 
05:28:31.868 --> 05:28:31.878 align:start position:0%
would have not express opinion one way
 
05:28:33.948 --> 05:28:33.958 align:start position:0%
or the other because I do uh very much
 
05:28:37.270 --> 05:28:37.280 align:start position:0%
respect the three sponsors um and I
 
05:28:39.628 --> 05:28:39.638 align:start position:0%
totally uh I totally uh support the
 
05:28:41.270 --> 05:28:41.280 align:start position:0%
larger effort that's part of I think
 
05:28:44.910 --> 05:28:44.920 align:start position:0%
this particular bill has has some issues
 
05:28:48.470 --> 05:28:48.480 align:start position:0%
and um is probably uh certainly not
 
05:28:50.750 --> 05:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
certainly certainly uh passing it would
 
05:28:52.948 --> 05:28:52.958 align:start position:0%
be a bad idea I mean might you might
 
05:28:55.190 --> 05:28:55.200 align:start position:0%
want to you want feel like raining and
 
05:28:56.868 --> 05:28:56.878 align:start position:0%
studying the issue that'd be good but
 
05:28:58.868 --> 05:28:58.878 align:start position:0%
probably don't want to do that given uh
 
05:29:00.868 --> 05:29:00.878 align:start position:0%
just the way things are here in the New
 
05:29:02.990 --> 05:29:03.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire house so that that's what I
 
05:29:04.350 --> 05:29:04.360 align:start position:0%
that's I wanted to say I'm a little bit
 
05:29:07.350 --> 05:29:07.360 align:start position:0%
embarrassed U and the other two minimum
 
05:29:09.868 --> 05:29:09.878 align:start position:0%
wage bills I totally support him I think
 
05:29:12.470 --> 05:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
even 2250 is not excessive but that's
 
05:29:14.948 --> 05:29:14.958 align:start position:0%
not so I just want to be the record I
 
05:29:16.390 --> 05:29:16.400 align:start position:0%
support the other two pills very
 
05:29:19.190 --> 05:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
strongly but not this one and um this
 
05:29:20.548 --> 05:29:20.558 align:start position:0%
probably unnecessary because probably
 
05:29:22.350 --> 05:29:22.360 align:start position:0%
nobody is actually going to do it's
 
05:29:23.990 --> 05:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
unclear who of anybody aside from the
 
05:29:25.830 --> 05:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
chair X it gets to see these long lists
 
05:29:28.548 --> 05:29:28.558 align:start position:0%
of people who signed in but I still
 
05:29:30.990 --> 05:29:31.000 align:start position:0%
thought I should do so I should log in
 
05:29:33.628 --> 05:29:33.638 align:start position:0%
and like retreat from what I what I said
 
05:29:35.070 --> 05:29:35.080 align:start position:0%
earlier today when I was filling out the
 
05:29:37.310 --> 05:29:37.320 align:start position:0%
form so um thank you very much and I was
 
05:29:39.390 --> 05:29:39.400 align:start position:0%
not as brief as I was hoping would be
 
05:29:41.628 --> 05:29:41.638 align:start position:0%
but thanks if I have any questions
 
05:29:43.270 --> 05:29:43.280 align:start position:0%
you're welcome to ask them thank you
 
05:29:44.628 --> 05:29:44.638 align:start position:0%
representative Oregon we will be
 
05:29:46.150 --> 05:29:46.160 align:start position:0%
addressing the other Bill shortly if you
 
05:29:47.868 --> 05:29:47.878 align:start position:0%
want to log on in a few
 
05:29:50.470 --> 05:29:50.480 align:start position:0%
minutes go to I might try to log on so
 
05:29:52.628 --> 05:29:52.638 align:start position:0%
yes I'm totally in favor of paying
 
05:29:54.270 --> 05:29:54.280 align:start position:0%
people more I think that's good for the
 
05:29:56.190 --> 05:29:56.200 align:start position:0%
economy and including ad junk back a
 
05:29:58.830 --> 05:29:58.840 align:start position:0%
little just as buil the way it works is
 
05:30:01.948 --> 05:30:01.958 align:start position:0%
kind of problematic so thank thank you
 
05:30:04.390 --> 05:30:04.400 align:start position:0%
representative Horgan Christina the
 
05:30:04.400 --> 05:30:05.548 align:start position:0%

05:30:12.190 --> 05:30:12.200 align:start position:0%

05:30:14.470 --> 05:30:14.480 align:start position:0%
have their hands up Jacob Bennett has
 
05:30:18.830 --> 05:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:21.868 --> 05:30:21.878 align:start position:0%
spoken so aside from those two who have
 
05:30:26.590 --> 05:30:26.600 align:start position:0%

Nashville w s and of all days in your
 
05:31:50.230 --> 05:31:50.240 align:start position:0%
infinite wisdom you scheduled the
 
05:31:52.430 --> 05:31:52.440 align:start position:0%
minimum wage bills when they're
 
05:31:57.030 --> 05:31:57.040 align:start position:0%
newsworthy from Co Coast to Coast
 
05:32:01.070 --> 05:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
um today s Seattle's bill became an
 
05:32:03.430 --> 05:32:03.440 align:start position:0%
active Bill to raise the minimum wage to
 
05:32:07.110 --> 05:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
15 an hour and in the last election um
 
05:32:10.868 --> 05:32:10.878 align:start position:0%
Florida raised their minimum wage to $15
 
05:32:15.310 --> 05:32:15.320 align:start position:0%
an hour the minimum wage came about in
 
05:32:19.510 --> 05:32:19.520 align:start position:0%
1938 from uh Franklin delanor Roosevelt
 
05:32:22.510 --> 05:32:22.520 align:start position:0%
after the Great Depression from the Fair
 
05:32:28.150 --> 05:32:28.160 align:start position:0%
Labor Standard um act and it was a a
 
05:32:30.708 --> 05:32:30.718 align:start position:0%
robust 25 cents an hour
 
05:32:34.788 --> 05:32:34.798 align:start position:0%
hour and um he had he made a statement
 
05:32:38.190 --> 05:32:38.200 align:start position:0%
then and said no business which Depends
 
05:32:41.470 --> 05:32:41.480 align:start position:0%
for its existence on paying less than
 
05:32:45.230 --> 05:32:45.240 align:start position:0%
living wages to its workers has any
 
05:32:47.510 --> 05:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
right to continue in this
 
05:32:50.788 --> 05:32:50.798 align:start position:0%
country um
 
05:32:52.990 --> 05:32:53.000 align:start position:0%
so for
 
05:32:56.910 --> 05:32:56.920 align:start position:0%
me I started my first job when I was 14
 
05:32:58.590 --> 05:32:58.600 align:start position:0%
and that was in
 
05:33:01.470 --> 05:33:01.480 align:start position:0%
1969 minimum minimum wage was less than
 
05:33:05.670 --> 05:33:05.680 align:start position:0%
$2 an hour and here we are in
 
05:33:10.310 --> 05:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
2021 and it's gone up to
 
05:33:14.430 --> 05:33:14.440 align:start position:0%
$725 an hour and I just think it's
 
05:33:18.750 --> 05:33:18.760 align:start position:0%
ludicrous for the um adjusted for what
 
05:33:20.788 --> 05:33:20.798 align:start position:0%
it should be in the
 
05:33:25.510 --> 05:33:25.520 align:start position:0%
30s um there's a the wage stagnation for
 
05:33:31.190 --> 05:33:31.200 align:start position:0%
the poor is is just incredibly awful and
 
05:33:34.910 --> 05:33:34.920 align:start position:0%
the reason why I chose
 
05:33:38.830 --> 05:33:38.840 align:start position:0%
2250 is because I
 
05:33:44.190 --> 05:33:44.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:47.948 --> 05:33:47.958 align:start position:0%
Express that the despair of the
 
05:33:51.830 --> 05:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
poor and this last year there was no
 
05:33:54.948 --> 05:33:54.958 align:start position:0%
plans for this pandemic there was no
 
05:33:58.190 --> 05:33:58.200 align:start position:0%
plans for the uh winter for how people
 
05:34:00.590 --> 05:34:00.600 align:start position:0%
were going to get through there's just
 
05:34:05.470 --> 05:34:05.480 align:start position:0%
people are hurting really really bad and
 
05:34:07.830 --> 05:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
some of the food banks have been out of
 
05:34:11.110 --> 05:34:11.120 align:start position:0%
food and all the state could come up
 
05:34:11.120 --> 05:34:12.708 align:start position:0%
food and all the state could come up
with

05:34:12.708 --> 05:34:12.718 align:start position:0%
with
 
05:34:16.590 --> 05:34:16.600 align:start position:0%
um in the fall was uh moving homeless
 
05:34:18.310 --> 05:34:18.320 align:start position:0%
people off of the
 
05:34:21.430 --> 05:34:21.440 align:start position:0%
courthouse um and put them back by the
 
05:34:24.590 --> 05:34:24.600 align:start position:0%
river the homeless so that's why I I
 
05:34:27.230 --> 05:34:27.240 align:start position:0%
want to
 
05:34:31.788 --> 05:34:31.798 align:start position:0%
encourage um a a bro broad robust
 
05:34:35.070 --> 05:34:35.080 align:start position:0%
discussion about what the minimum wage
 
05:34:38.990 --> 05:34:39.000 align:start position:0%
should be it does the research is there
 
05:34:41.190 --> 05:34:41.200 align:start position:0%
that Rising the minimum raising the
 
05:34:44.470 --> 05:34:44.480 align:start position:0%
minimum wage does
 
05:34:49.430 --> 05:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
not depress the economy it does not harm
 
05:34:53.190 --> 05:34:53.200 align:start position:0%
businesses I want to know for the cares
 
05:34:55.628 --> 05:34:55.638 align:start position:0%
act money that the governor received how
 
05:34:58.190 --> 05:34:58.200 align:start position:0%
much of that went to small businesses
 
05:35:00.510 --> 05:35:00.520 align:start position:0%
our small businesses are Hur hurting
 
05:35:03.990 --> 05:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
they're hurting bad and
 
05:35:08.670 --> 05:35:08.680 align:start position:0%
um yet we persist in giving tax credit
 
05:35:11.750 --> 05:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
tax cuts to the big businesses that
 
05:35:14.430 --> 05:35:14.440 align:start position:0%
don't often work in New Hampshire but
 
05:35:18.708 --> 05:35:18.718 align:start position:0%
they have um their headquarters here and
 
05:35:22.390 --> 05:35:22.400 align:start position:0%
so where is all of this money and I
 
05:35:25.110 --> 05:35:25.120 align:start position:0%
think it should come down to Grants for
 
05:35:28.990 --> 05:35:29.000 align:start position:0%
small um businesses and we need to talk
 
05:35:29.000 --> 05:35:30.510 align:start position:0%
small um businesses and we need to talk
seriously

05:35:30.510 --> 05:35:30.520 align:start position:0%
seriously
 
05:35:35.788 --> 05:35:35.798 align:start position:0%
about not a minimum wage but how uh
 
05:35:39.628 --> 05:35:39.638 align:start position:0%
living wage can be better for New
 
05:35:42.590 --> 05:35:42.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I just implore
 
05:35:46.030 --> 05:35:46.040 align:start position:0%
you I know that this is asking for the
 
05:35:49.510 --> 05:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
world in this bill because there's no
 
05:35:53.708 --> 05:35:53.718 align:start position:0%
lag and there's no staggered thing a
 
05:35:57.150 --> 05:35:57.160 align:start position:0%
date of um starting but what I want you
 
05:36:00.590 --> 05:36:00.600 align:start position:0%
to know is there's people out there in
 
05:36:04.548 --> 05:36:04.558 align:start position:0%
this state who work hard they work so
 
05:36:08.190 --> 05:36:08.200 align:start position:0%
hard and they're hungry they're hungry
 
05:36:11.670 --> 05:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
they're cold and people are isolated
 
05:36:15.150 --> 05:36:15.160 align:start position:0%
because of the pandemic and we need to
 
05:36:18.390 --> 05:36:18.400 align:start position:0%
as a legislature to help them and to
 
05:36:21.510 --> 05:36:21.520 align:start position:0%
help our communities and that's what I
 
05:36:24.708 --> 05:36:24.718 align:start position:0%
um have for you today and I'm um open
 
05:36:26.548 --> 05:36:26.558 align:start position:0%
for all the questions that I know are
 
05:36:28.190 --> 05:36:28.200 align:start position:0%
going to come and I already know what
 
05:36:33.070 --> 05:36:33.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:34.350 --> 05:36:34.360 align:start position:0%
does that conclude your testimony
 
05:36:36.708 --> 05:36:36.718 align:start position:0%

a little slow um hello uh representative
 
05:36:59.150 --> 05:36:59.160 align:start position:0%
sakas it's good to see you um have you
 
05:37:01.868 --> 05:37:01.878 align:start position:0%
used the living wage calculator that's
 
05:37:05.830 --> 05:37:05.840 align:start position:0%
available online I think MIT has done
 
05:37:10.070 --> 05:37:10.080 align:start position:0%
it um no but I did read a research
 
05:37:13.470 --> 05:37:13.480 align:start position:0%
article over the summer that it would be
 
05:37:16.470 --> 05:37:16.480 align:start position:0%
2250 an hour yeah it's there's no
 
05:37:17.868 --> 05:37:17.878 align:start position:0%
question about it if you if you look at
 
05:37:20.070 --> 05:37:20.080 align:start position:0%
the living wage calculator they actually
 
05:37:22.548 --> 05:37:22.558 align:start position:0%
can break it down to nasua and if you
 
05:37:24.310 --> 05:37:24.320 align:start position:0%
look at it you'll see that they don't
 
05:37:27.548 --> 05:37:27.558 align:start position:0%
even have that the the costs are crazy
 
05:37:29.868 --> 05:37:29.878 align:start position:0%
out of line with with what's real here
 
05:37:32.750 --> 05:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
on the ground uh the other thing is um
 
05:37:35.110 --> 05:37:35.120 align:start position:0%
you're familiar with um places like
 
05:37:38.230 --> 05:37:38.240 align:start position:0%
Walmart that do not pay enough for their
 
05:37:42.270 --> 05:37:42.280 align:start position:0%

05:37:45.310 --> 05:37:45.320 align:start position:0%
government assistance yes yes yes called
 
05:37:46.830 --> 05:37:46.840 align:start position:0%
The Working Poor these are the people
 
05:37:48.230 --> 05:37:48.240 align:start position:0%

committee my name is Greg Huff I'm rep
 
05:38:24.390 --> 05:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
uh state representative belnap County
 
05:38:27.030 --> 05:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
District 3 lonan I'm testifying today as
 
05:38:28.510 --> 05:38:28.520 align:start position:0%
a member of the
 
05:38:28.520 --> 05:38:30.270 align:start position:0%
a member of the
public

05:38:30.270 --> 05:38:30.280 align:start position:0%
public
 
05:38:32.708 --> 05:38:32.718 align:start position:0%
in almost every circumstance programs
 
05:38:34.430 --> 05:38:34.440 align:start position:0%
set up by the
 
05:38:37.350 --> 05:38:37.360 align:start position:0%
government that are to help so-called
 
05:38:39.750 --> 05:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
disadvantaged groups such as the poor or
 
05:38:42.190 --> 05:38:42.200 align:start position:0%
the needy or in this case low wage
 
05:38:44.788 --> 05:38:44.798 align:start position:0%
workers almost always have the exact
 
05:38:47.430 --> 05:38:47.440 align:start position:0%
opposite effects on those groups that
 
05:38:50.150 --> 05:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
their well-intended sponsors hope
 
05:38:53.708 --> 05:38:53.718 align:start position:0%
for in the case of minimum wage as with
 
05:38:56.510 --> 05:38:56.520 align:start position:0%
any bad legislation it stems from two
 
05:38:59.310 --> 05:38:59.320 align:start position:0%
groups the special interest groups such
 
05:39:02.350 --> 05:39:02.360 align:start position:0%
as in this case trade or labor unions
 
05:39:05.190 --> 05:39:05.200 align:start position:0%
and the well-intentioned do gooders who
 
05:39:06.708 --> 05:39:06.718 align:start position:0%
believe they are helping people by
 
05:39:09.548 --> 05:39:09.558 align:start position:0%
enacting a law that proclaims nobody
 
05:39:10.990 --> 05:39:11.000 align:start position:0%
will get paid less than
 
05:39:14.628 --> 05:39:14.638 align:start position:0%
$22.50 per hour when in reality this
 
05:39:16.628 --> 05:39:16.638 align:start position:0%
bill will do nothing of the
 
05:39:19.350 --> 05:39:19.360 align:start position:0%
kind what you are in fact doing is
 
05:39:22.070 --> 05:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
ensuring that people whose skills
 
05:39:26.310 --> 05:39:26.320 align:start position:0%
education or experience do not justify
 
05:39:30.230 --> 05:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
that kind of a wage will be unemployed
 
05:39:31.990 --> 05:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
if a person comes to an employer for a
 
05:39:34.030 --> 05:39:34.040 align:start position:0%
job say in the construction field has
 
05:39:36.590 --> 05:39:36.600 align:start position:0%
little to no skills and is worth perhaps
 
05:39:39.590 --> 05:39:39.600 align:start position:0%
$10 per hour to clean up the job site
 
05:39:41.590 --> 05:39:41.600 align:start position:0%
assist with manual labor all while
 
05:39:44.150 --> 05:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
learning to be a carpenter or a backhoe
 
05:39:47.708 --> 05:39:47.718 align:start position:0%
operator HB 107 would now make it
 
05:39:49.868 --> 05:39:49.878 align:start position:0%
illegal for that employer to hire that
 
05:39:52.070 --> 05:39:52.080 align:start position:0%
person unless the employer was willing
 
05:39:55.708 --> 05:39:55.718 align:start position:0%
to engage in charity moreover the person
 
05:39:57.830 --> 05:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
misses out on the opportunity to learn
 
05:39:59.910 --> 05:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
on the job skills knowledge and
 
05:40:02.350 --> 05:40:02.360 align:start position:0%
experience that someday May indeed make
 
05:40:04.430 --> 05:40:04.440 align:start position:0%
that employee highly valuable and worth
 
05:40:04.440 --> 05:40:05.750 align:start position:0%
that employee highly valuable and worth
more

05:40:05.750 --> 05:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
more
 
05:40:08.430 --> 05:40:08.440 align:start position:0%
money we now will have created a weak
 
05:40:10.750 --> 05:40:10.760 align:start position:0%
and inefficient Workforce while
 
05:40:12.868 --> 05:40:12.878 align:start position:0%
establishing a permanent class of
 
05:40:14.670 --> 05:40:14.680 align:start position:0%
welfare WS of the
 
05:40:17.310 --> 05:40:17.320 align:start position:0%
state this law would require employers
 
05:40:19.910 --> 05:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
to discriminate against people with low
 
05:40:24.030 --> 05:40:24.040 align:start position:0%
skills education or experience this is
 
05:40:26.190 --> 05:40:26.200 align:start position:0%
by definition institutional
 
05:40:28.350 --> 05:40:28.360 align:start position:0%
discrimination and would harm the very
 
05:40:31.150 --> 05:40:31.160 align:start position:0%
people that's supposed to to hurt in
 
05:40:33.590 --> 05:40:33.600 align:start position:0%
closing we all would like to and I
 
05:40:37.468 --> 05:40:37.478 align:start position:0%
emphasize here earn more money however
 
05:40:40.110 --> 05:40:40.120 align:start position:0%
it is clear that HB 107 will would
 
05:40:42.430 --> 05:40:42.440 align:start position:0%
legalize discrimination against the good
 
05:40:44.468 --> 05:40:44.478 align:start position:0%
people of New Hampshire by their
 
05:40:46.350 --> 05:40:46.360 align:start position:0%
government as well as producing

crippling restrictions on our business

Community as thus I must urge this
 
05:40:55.230 --> 05:40:55.240 align:start position:0%
committee to declare HV 107 inexpedient
 
05:40:57.990 --> 05:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
to legislate there is no place in this
 
05:40:59.868 --> 05:40:59.878 align:start position:0%
state for discrimination
 
05:41:02.230 --> 05:41:02.240 align:start position:0%

I'm such a
 
05:44:24.750 --> 05:44:24.760 align:start position:0%
person uh I used to be a
 
05:44:27.150 --> 05:44:27.160 align:start position:0%
musician as you can imagine musicians
 
05:44:30.310 --> 05:44:30.320 align:start position:0%
don't always make a lot lot of money at
 
05:44:35.150 --> 05:44:35.160 align:start position:0%
all um while doing that my
 
05:44:39.910 --> 05:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
family uh was starting and as such at
 
05:44:43.628 --> 05:44:43.638 align:start position:0%
the exact same time my wife and
 
05:44:47.628 --> 05:44:47.638 align:start position:0%
I both decided to go back to school to
 
05:44:51.150 --> 05:44:51.160 align:start position:0%
get educations so we had a toddler we
 
05:44:53.590 --> 05:44:53.600 align:start position:0%

um medical
 
05:45:12.270 --> 05:45:12.280 align:start position:0%

it's it's uh on the person and uh what
 
05:45:17.590 --> 05:45:17.600 align:start position:0%
it is that they would like to do there
 
05:45:19.830 --> 05:45:19.840 align:start position:0%

05:45:19.840 --> 05:45:21.030 align:start position:0%
are plenty of avenues available to
improve

what sort of wages you were earning
 
05:45:53.310 --> 05:45:53.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:55.910 --> 05:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
process was there a minimum wage or or
 
05:45:59.468 --> 05:45:59.478 align:start position:0%
were you able to get uh a high wage than
 
05:46:01.150 --> 05:46:01.160 align:start position:0%
seven and a quarter an
 
05:46:03.628 --> 05:46:03.638 align:start position:0%
hour I you you broke up a little bit in
 
05:46:05.628 --> 05:46:05.638 align:start position:0%
the middle of that
 
05:46:09.708 --> 05:46:09.718 align:start position:0%
represent sorry uh let me try
 
05:46:13.468 --> 05:46:13.478 align:start position:0%
again uh what sort of wages were you
 
05:46:15.548 --> 05:46:15.558 align:start position:0%
earning uh when you were in this you
 
05:46:17.788 --> 05:46:17.798 align:start position:0%
know education and uh you know
 
05:46:20.788 --> 05:46:20.798 align:start position:0%
furtherance of your of your uh situation
 
05:46:23.190 --> 05:46:23.200 align:start position:0%
we were both working for minimum wage or
 
05:46:26.030 --> 05:46:26.040 align:start position:0%
was it a little bit higher than that uh
 
05:46:28.070 --> 05:46:28.080 align:start position:0%
we were working I would assume a little
 
05:46:32.150 --> 05:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:36.030 --> 05:46:36.040 align:start position:0%
um my wife was uh still in the uh
 
05:46:39.350 --> 05:46:39.360 align:start position:0%
medical field she was just um in the
 
05:46:41.670 --> 05:46:41.680 align:start position:0%
administration of of that so she was
 
05:46:45.510 --> 05:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
running an office and I again like I
 
05:46:49.788 --> 05:46:49.798 align:start position:0%
said was a a musician but I also was a h
 
05:46:56.070 --> 05:46:56.080 align:start position:0%
Service employee so um I was on tips so
 
05:46:59.390 --> 05:46:59.400 align:start position:0%
it basically it depended on how well I
 
05:47:02.030 --> 05:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
did my job whether or not I made money
 
05:47:02.040 --> 05:47:03.350 align:start position:0%
did my job whether or not I made money
or

05:47:03.350 --> 05:47:03.360 align:start position:0%
or
 
05:47:08.190 --> 05:47:08.200 align:start position:0%
not um followup follow up representative
 
05:47:10.310 --> 05:47:10.320 align:start position:0%
yeah I I think that I think the tip part
 
05:47:12.868 --> 05:47:12.878 align:start position:0%
also reflect was determined by the uh
 
05:47:14.468 --> 05:47:14.478 align:start position:0%
generosity of the
 
05:47:16.910 --> 05:47:16.920 align:start position:0%
customer uh which you sometimes a good
 
05:47:19.708 --> 05:47:19.718 align:start position:0%
job doesn't always yield a good
 
05:47:22.110 --> 05:47:22.120 align:start position:0%
tip just one more followup what what do
 
05:47:25.628 --> 05:47:25.638 align:start position:0%
you play representative Huff uh guitar
 
05:47:28.830 --> 05:47:28.840 align:start position:0%
guitar I'm a bass player and uh our
 
05:47:31.030 --> 05:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
chairman is a reformed drummer I play
 
05:47:32.590 --> 05:47:32.600 align:start position:0%
the drum we could have a band right here
 
05:47:36.868 --> 05:47:36.878 align:start position:0%
I think so the labor band the labor band
 
05:47:38.310 --> 05:47:38.320 align:start position:0%
any other questions for the
 
05:47:40.548 --> 05:47:40.558 align:start position:0%

testifying on uh House Bill 107 and I
 
05:48:22.270 --> 05:48:22.280 align:start position:0%
won't uh I don't really want to get into
 
05:48:24.990 --> 05:48:25.000 align:start position:0%
uh the hourly rate and what that should
 
05:48:27.868 --> 05:48:27.878 align:start position:0%
be I think because that is probably
 
05:48:29.948 --> 05:48:29.958 align:start position:0%
largely going to be be decided on the
 
05:48:32.510 --> 05:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
federal level I think uh you know we all
 
05:48:35.190 --> 05:48:35.200 align:start position:0%
see that there's a move for federal
 
05:48:37.590 --> 05:48:37.600 align:start position:0%
legislation I think with a makeup down
 
05:48:38.990 --> 05:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
there there's probably a pretty good
 
05:48:42.070 --> 05:48:42.080 align:start position:0%
chance that uh the the wage will
 
05:48:43.548 --> 05:48:43.558 align:start position:0%
probably get increased on the federal
 
05:48:46.310 --> 05:48:46.320 align:start position:0%
level and as you know the state of New
 
05:48:49.030 --> 05:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has to follow the Federal
 
05:48:52.030 --> 05:48:52.040 align:start position:0%
which sets a floor so um you know I
 
05:48:54.628 --> 05:48:54.638 align:start position:0%
don't think uh you know there's a lot of
 
05:48:56.510 --> 05:48:56.520 align:start position:0%
uh good in US debating what it should be
 
05:48:58.230 --> 05:48:58.240 align:start position:0%
here because I think for a large uh
 
05:49:00.190 --> 05:49:00.200 align:start position:0%
degree it'll probably be decided on the
 
05:49:02.788 --> 05:49:02.798 align:start position:0%
federal level but I do want to address
 
05:49:06.910 --> 05:49:06.920 align:start position:0%
um a section of current law uh that we
 
05:49:10.868 --> 05:49:10.878 align:start position:0%
would like to have uh addressed and in
 
05:49:14.430 --> 05:49:14.440 align:start position:0%
fact I I emailed the committee yesterday
 
05:49:17.788 --> 05:49:17.798 align:start position:0%
uh two attachments uh one attachment is
 
05:49:21.948 --> 05:49:21.958 align:start position:0%
a bill that uh Senator Bradley uh has
 
05:49:24.830 --> 05:49:24.840 align:start position:0%
filed uh it hasn't come out yet but it
 
05:49:27.190 --> 05:49:27.200 align:start position:0%
is something that is to address uh the
 
05:49:31.510 --> 05:49:31.520 align:start position:0%
tip wage um um in the statute right now
 
05:49:36.430 --> 05:49:36.440 align:start position:0%
um the tip wage is essentially tied to
 
05:49:39.910 --> 05:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
uh the minimum wage the hourly rate as
 
05:49:41.750 --> 05:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
you know we don't have a state minimum
 
05:49:44.670 --> 05:49:44.680 align:start position:0%
wage right now so our tip wage
 
05:49:48.390 --> 05:49:48.400 align:start position:0%
essentially tied to the federal minimum
 
05:49:51.670 --> 05:49:51.680 align:start position:0%
wage and for those of you that have uh
 
05:49:53.990 --> 05:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
the legislation that I emailed in front
 
05:49:56.830 --> 05:49:56.840 align:start position:0%
of you you will notice in statute that
 
05:49:59.230 --> 05:49:59.240 align:start position:0%
it says um
 
05:50:01.788 --> 05:50:01.798 align:start position:0%
the wage from the
 
05:50:04.548 --> 05:50:04.558 align:start position:0%
employer that tipped employees get shall
 
05:50:04.558 --> 05:50:06.190 align:start position:0%
employer that tipped employees get shall
be

05:50:06.190 --> 05:50:06.200 align:start position:0%
be
 
05:50:10.750 --> 05:50:10.760 align:start position:0%
45% of the hourly minimum wage um and
 
05:50:14.510 --> 05:50:14.520 align:start position:0%
right now uh that is
 
05:50:17.390 --> 05:50:17.400 align:start position:0%
$327 and you know when I'm talking about
 
05:50:19.788 --> 05:50:19.798 align:start position:0%
minimum wage uh when I'm talking about
 
05:50:23.510 --> 05:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
tipped employees tipped employees aren't
 
05:50:26.270 --> 05:50:26.280 align:start position:0%
minimum wage workers they're not minimum
 
05:50:30.868 --> 05:50:30.878 align:start position:0%
wage hourly workers um on average uh the
 
05:50:35.430 --> 05:50:35.440 align:start position:0%
take-home is between $18 and $20 an hour
 
05:50:38.948 --> 05:50:38.958 align:start position:0%
with wages uh from the employer and tips
 
05:50:41.430 --> 05:50:41.440 align:start position:0%
combined I mean the bulk of what they
 
05:50:44.468 --> 05:50:44.478 align:start position:0%
earn comes in tips uh but they're
 
05:50:47.150 --> 05:50:47.160 align:start position:0%
considered wages uh they have to report
 
05:50:50.788 --> 05:50:50.798 align:start position:0%
them as wages the employer pays the FICA
 
05:50:54.390 --> 05:50:54.400 align:start position:0%
and uh the taxes on those tips as wages
 
05:50:56.948 --> 05:50:56.958 align:start position:0%
so they're essentially wages and again
 
05:50:58.590 --> 05:50:58.600 align:start position:0%
they're they're earning about between
 
05:51:02.868 --> 05:51:02.878 align:start position:0%
$18 and $220 an hour um but in the New
 
05:51:06.708 --> 05:51:06.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire statute the minimum that um
 
05:51:09.948 --> 05:51:09.958 align:start position:0%
they must get from the employer is uh
 
05:51:13.468 --> 05:51:13.478 align:start position:0%
written in the statute as 45% of the
 
05:51:17.750 --> 05:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
hourly range what we would like to do is
 
05:51:23.110 --> 05:51:23.120 align:start position:0%
change it from um a percentage of the
 
05:51:27.350 --> 05:51:27.360 align:start position:0%
minimum hourly rate to a specific number
 
05:51:28.948 --> 05:51:28.958 align:start position:0%
in the statute
 
05:51:33.590 --> 05:51:33.600 align:start position:0%
um the bill um that Senator Bradley has
 
05:51:38.788 --> 05:51:38.798 align:start position:0%
uh would keep it at 327 per hour um I
 
05:51:41.230 --> 05:51:41.240 align:start position:0%
also included a bill that was uh
 
05:51:44.868 --> 05:51:44.878 align:start position:0%
introduced last year by Senator
 
05:51:48.030 --> 05:51:48.040 align:start position:0%
Susi um the Senate President uh last
 
05:51:51.628 --> 05:51:51.638 align:start position:0%
year and she um in her bill did
 
05:51:55.788 --> 05:51:55.798 align:start position:0%
something similar um she struck out 45%
 
05:51:58.430 --> 05:51:58.440 align:start position:0%
of the applicable minimum wage and she
 
05:52:01.868 --> 05:52:01.878 align:start position:0%
in her bill $4 but uh the reason for
 
05:52:03.868 --> 05:52:03.878 align:start position:0%
bringing that up is I think you know we
 
05:52:06.708 --> 05:52:06.718 align:start position:0%
were on the same page and sort of uh
 
05:52:09.110 --> 05:52:09.120 align:start position:0%
wanting to put a specific number in
 
05:52:11.868 --> 05:52:11.878 align:start position:0%
statute because if the federal minimum
 
05:52:14.788 --> 05:52:14.798 align:start position:0%
wage does go up to $15 let's just say
 
05:52:19.390 --> 05:52:19.400 align:start position:0%
that happens um the uh minimum wage for
 
05:52:24.190 --> 05:52:24.200 align:start position:0%
tipped employees would go from 327 to
 
05:52:28.070 --> 05:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
675 um which is just about double uh of
 
05:52:31.310 --> 05:52:31.320 align:start position:0%
what what it is now uh in many of the
 
05:52:32.788 --> 05:52:32.798 align:start position:0%
restaurants that I've talked to have
 
05:52:35.628 --> 05:52:35.638 align:start position:0%
said that would represent about a 40%
 
05:52:39.708 --> 05:52:39.718 align:start position:0%
increase in their payroll costs uh which
 
05:52:41.270 --> 05:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
it's got to come out of someplace and
 
05:52:43.190 --> 05:52:43.200 align:start position:0%
would probably be you know the the
 
05:52:48.030 --> 05:52:48.040 align:start position:0%
increase in uh uh menu prices um so uh
 
05:52:50.430 --> 05:52:50.440 align:start position:0%
what we would like to do and would again
 
05:52:53.110 --> 05:52:53.120 align:start position:0%
it's a Senate Bill uh it's going to be
 
05:52:54.910 --> 05:52:54.920 align:start position:0%
discussed in the Senate we hope to get
 
05:52:57.430 --> 05:52:57.440 align:start position:0%
some bipartisan support and that it
 
05:53:00.750 --> 05:53:00.760 align:start position:0%
comes to the house in the spring um so
 
05:53:03.468 --> 05:53:03.478 align:start position:0%
you very well may be dealing uh with
 
05:53:04.910 --> 05:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
that bill again it doesn't have a bill
 
05:53:08.190 --> 05:53:08.200 align:start position:0%
number yet it's still in LSR um but I
 
05:53:10.150 --> 05:53:10.160 align:start position:0%
just wanted to give you a heads up uh
 
05:53:13.510 --> 05:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
that the issue of uh the tip wage in New
 
05:53:15.670 --> 05:53:15.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire statute is something that
 
05:53:17.110 --> 05:53:17.120 align:start position:0%
we're going to want to have a discussion
 
05:53:19.670 --> 05:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
with you and your committee and it will
 
05:53:22.190 --> 05:53:22.200 align:start position:0%
probably come in the form of Senator
 
05:53:25.548 --> 05:53:25.558 align:start position:0%
Bradley's bill which you will get after
 
05:53:27.990 --> 05:53:28.000 align:start position:0%
crossover uh and we'll be discussing the
 
05:53:31.430 --> 05:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
you you uh in the spring so that's it um
 
05:53:33.030 --> 05:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions if
 
05:53:34.350 --> 05:53:34.360 align:start position:0%
anybody has
 
05:53:36.910 --> 05:53:36.920 align:start position:0%
any do I see any questions from any
 
05:53:36.920 --> 05:53:40.510 align:start position:0%
any do I see any questions from any
members

05:53:40.510 --> 05:53:40.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:44.430 --> 05:53:44.440 align:start position:0%
online I do not see any hands anyone any
 
05:53:46.110 --> 05:53:46.120 align:start position:0%
in the uh community room uh
 
05:53:46.120 --> 05:53:55.830 align:start position:0%
in the uh community room uh
representative

05:53:55.830 --> 05:53:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:58.390 --> 05:53:58.400 align:start position:0%
seaworth thank you for your testimony
 
05:54:01.628 --> 05:54:01.638 align:start position:0%
and your update on the um proposed
 
05:54:05.830 --> 05:54:05.840 align:start position:0%
Senate bill I did have a question um if
 
05:54:10.190 --> 05:54:10.200 align:start position:0%
you have knowledge on this the other New
 
05:54:12.708 --> 05:54:12.718 align:start position:0%
England states are
 
05:54:16.708 --> 05:54:16.718 align:start position:0%
we an outlier in that our tipped wage is
 
05:54:19.830 --> 05:54:19.840 align:start position:0%
done as a percentage is do other states
 
05:54:23.990 --> 05:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
do it that way or do um our neighbors
 
05:54:28.670 --> 05:54:28.680 align:start position:0%
all tend to have a fixed rate for
 
05:54:30.830 --> 05:54:30.840 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question we are an
 
05:54:33.868 --> 05:54:33.878 align:start position:0%
outlier uh the other states uh have uh
 
05:54:36.948 --> 05:54:36.958 align:start position:0%
basically fixed uh mounts in the statute
 
05:54:39.030 --> 05:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
which the legislature can revisit as
 
05:54:41.190 --> 05:54:41.200 align:start position:0%
they would you know anytime they wanted
 
05:54:45.510 --> 05:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
to revisit uh the minimum hour Le um but
 
05:54:48.788 --> 05:54:48.798 align:start position:0%
the unique way we have it crafted now uh
 
05:54:51.868 --> 05:54:51.878 align:start position:0%
just it will decimate restaurants if it
 
05:54:55.670 --> 05:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
remains a percentage of the hourly so we
 
05:54:57.150 --> 05:54:57.160 align:start position:0%
would like but thank you for your
 
05:54:59.708 --> 05:54:59.718 align:start position:0%
question we'd like to to uh to do what
 
05:55:03.910 --> 05:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
Most states do and have a specific U
 
05:55:05.310 --> 05:55:05.320 align:start position:0%
amount of
 
05:55:09.310 --> 05:55:09.320 align:start position:0%
Statute thank you representative kahill
 
05:55:12.190 --> 05:55:12.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh and M mru I
 
05:55:13.910 --> 05:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
know we've we've wandered off the topic
 
05:55:16.830 --> 05:55:16.840 align:start position:0%
of the bill at hand but since we've done
 
05:55:18.628 --> 05:55:18.638 align:start position:0%
that and we're talking about outliers
 
05:55:20.270 --> 05:55:20.280 align:start position:0%
isn't it true that New Hampshire is an
 
05:55:22.590 --> 05:55:22.600 align:start position:0%
outlier and that we allow the
 
05:55:26.110 --> 05:55:26.120 align:start position:0%
restaurants to retain 3% of the tax they
 
05:55:28.868 --> 05:55:28.878 align:start position:0%
collect from their customers
 
05:55:30.750 --> 05:55:30.760 align:start position:0%
um so that's an issue you're talking
 
05:55:33.990 --> 05:55:34.000 align:start position:0%
about the rooms of males tax so that's
 
05:55:36.708 --> 05:55:36.718 align:start position:0%
the restaurants for those not familiar
 
05:55:38.948 --> 05:55:38.958 align:start position:0%
with what uh representative K is talking
 
05:55:41.468 --> 05:55:41.478 align:start position:0%
about this is an issue that comes up in
 
05:55:43.628 --> 05:55:43.638 align:start position:0%
the house w means committee so the
 
05:55:45.990 --> 05:55:46.000 align:start position:0%
restaurants are responsible for
 
05:55:47.910 --> 05:55:47.920 align:start position:0%
collecting the rooms of meals tax for
 
05:55:50.468 --> 05:55:50.478 align:start position:0%
the state um there is a provision in the
 
05:55:52.750 --> 05:55:52.760 align:start position:0%
law that if they
 
05:55:58.430 --> 05:55:58.440 align:start position:0%
remitted by uh the 15th of the B day of
 
05:56:00.948 --> 05:56:00.958 align:start position:0%
the following month they get to retain
 
05:56:03.708 --> 05:56:03.718 align:start position:0%
3% of that as a commission for
 
05:56:08.390 --> 05:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
collecting the tax um and uh other
 
05:56:11.190 --> 05:56:11.200 align:start position:0%
states have different amounts um but New
 
05:56:15.310 --> 05:56:15.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does have 3% um you know uh
 
05:56:18.150 --> 05:56:18.160 align:start position:0%
for people that use credit cards uh
 
05:56:21.468 --> 05:56:21.478 align:start position:0%
going to restaurants um which is the
 
05:56:23.910 --> 05:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
majority people now uh there's a credit
 
05:56:27.030 --> 05:56:27.040 align:start position:0%
card fee charge uh uh there's a
 
05:56:29.270 --> 05:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
percentage charge on on that so it no
 
05:56:30.750 --> 05:56:30.760 align:start position:0%
one none of the restaurants are making
 
05:56:31.990 --> 05:56:32.000 align:start position:0%
money on it they're basically just
 
05:56:34.468 --> 05:56:34.478 align:start position:0%
covering their cost for collecting the
 
05:56:35.830 --> 05:56:35.840 align:start position:0%
tax for the
 
05:56:38.708 --> 05:56:38.718 align:start position:0%
state but that's that's an issue for the
 
05:56:41.990 --> 05:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
ways of need follow followup there a
 
05:56:44.270 --> 05:56:44.280 align:start position:0%
followup uh Mr ve would you U we're
 
05:56:46.430 --> 05:56:46.440 align:start position:0%
having a hard time you're getting could
 
05:56:48.708 --> 05:56:48.718 align:start position:0%
you uh off a little closer to your
 
05:56:51.230 --> 05:56:51.240 align:start position:0%
receiver or please is this
 
05:56:54.030 --> 05:56:54.040 align:start position:0%
better representative uh kale go ahead
 
05:56:57.590 --> 05:56:57.600 align:start position:0%
with your question uh yes uh Mr veu uh I
 
05:57:00.910 --> 05:57:00.920 align:start position:0%
know the IRS is going to be U processing
 
05:57:03.910 --> 05:57:03.920 align:start position:0%
returns uh in a couple of a week or so
 
05:57:05.468 --> 05:57:05.478 align:start position:0%
do you suppose we'll get a discount if
 
05:57:10.230 --> 05:57:10.240 align:start position:0%
we pay our pay our taxes early by the
 
05:57:10.240 --> 05:57:13.030 align:start position:0%
we pay our pay our taxes early by the
15th

05:57:13.030 --> 05:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
15th
 
05:57:16.708 --> 05:57:16.718 align:start position:0%
uh well uh um you know
 
05:57:19.548 --> 05:57:19.558 align:start position:0%
the individual taxes I think are a
 
05:57:23.708 --> 05:57:23.718 align:start position:0%
little different uh from uh the tax that
 
05:57:25.468 --> 05:57:25.478 align:start position:0%
uh the ruins of meal stack for instance
 
05:57:27.548 --> 05:57:27.558 align:start position:0%
which The Operators collect for the
 
05:57:30.548 --> 05:57:30.558 align:start position:0%
state I think uh for individuals and you
 
05:57:31.990 --> 05:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
know they don't retain anything for
 
05:57:34.670 --> 05:57:34.680 align:start position:0%
their business taxes that they pay uh
 
05:57:37.070 --> 05:57:37.080 align:start position:0%
obviously uh so I think it's kind of an
 
05:57:38.990 --> 05:57:39.000 align:start position:0%
apples to oranges comparison that you
 
05:57:42.548 --> 05:57:42.558 align:start position:0%
have rather than Apples to Apples right
 
05:57:44.230 --> 05:57:44.240 align:start position:0%
well thank you very much for your
 
05:57:46.948 --> 05:57:46.958 align:start position:0%
patience thank you representative kill
 
05:57:49.910 --> 05:57:49.920 align:start position:0%

05:58:00.110 --> 05:58:00.120 align:start position:0%
bill yes we have Bruce Burke who um
 
05:58:01.788 --> 05:58:01.798 align:start position:0%
signed up to
 
05:58:01.798 --> 05:58:03.990 align:start position:0%
signed up to
testify

05:58:03.990 --> 05:58:04.000 align:start position:0%
testify
 
05:58:12.150 --> 05:58:12.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:17.110 --> 05:58:17.120 align:start position:0%
speak Mr berky I am here sorry about
 
05:58:19.750 --> 05:58:19.760 align:start position:0%
that Mr chairman and members of the
 
05:58:21.190 --> 05:58:21.200 align:start position:0%
committee thank you very much for your
 
05:58:22.990 --> 05:58:23.000 align:start position:0%
time this afternoon I know you've had a
 
05:58:24.910 --> 05:58:24.920 align:start position:0%
a long day so I'll try to keep this as
 
05:58:27.708 --> 05:58:27.718 align:start position:0%
brief as possible as I speak to both
 
05:58:30.750 --> 05:58:30.760 align:start position:0%
house bills 107 and
 
05:58:33.628 --> 05:58:33.638 align:start position:0%
517 um I represent the national
 
05:58:35.830 --> 05:58:35.840 align:start position:0%
Federation of Independent
 
05:58:38.468 --> 05:58:38.478 align:start position:0%
Business Nationwide organization but
 
05:58:40.910 --> 05:58:40.920 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire we represent more
 
05:58:44.110 --> 05:58:44.120 align:start position:0%
than 1,000 New Hampshire small
 
05:58:47.510 --> 05:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
businesses and they oppose these
 
05:58:50.350 --> 05:58:50.360 align:start position:0%
increases in minimum wage and we incre
 
05:58:54.310 --> 05:58:54.320 align:start position:0%
we oppose them for a variety of reasons
 
05:58:56.628 --> 05:58:56.638 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences is the biggest
 
05:58:59.670 --> 05:58:59.680 align:start position:0%
reason if these
 
05:59:02.990 --> 05:59:03.000 align:start position:0%
rates more than double and triple in the
 
05:59:03.868 --> 05:59:03.878 align:start position:0%
case of
 
05:59:07.190 --> 05:59:07.200 align:start position:0%
107 fewer jobs will be available fewer
 
05:59:09.750 --> 05:59:09.760 align:start position:0%
hours for employees will be
 
05:59:12.310 --> 05:59:12.320 align:start position:0%
available and perhaps fewer businesses
 
05:59:15.030 --> 05:59:15.040 align:start position:0%
will be available and these this will be
 
05:59:17.468 --> 05:59:17.478 align:start position:0%
hurting the very employees that these
 
05:59:19.230 --> 05:59:19.240 align:start position:0%
Advocates are trying to
 
05:59:22.230 --> 05:59:22.240 align:start position:0%
help and why does this happen it happens
 
05:59:25.990 --> 05:59:26.000 align:start position:0%
because mandated actions minimums like
 
05:59:28.868 --> 05:59:28.878 align:start position:0%
the earlier bill on on mandating sick
 
05:59:32.310 --> 05:59:32.320 align:start position:0%
leave are are taking place to infringe
 
05:59:33.750 --> 05:59:33.760 align:start position:0%
upon the free
 
05:59:36.430 --> 05:59:36.440 align:start position:0%
market under the parameters of these
 
05:59:38.628 --> 05:59:38.638 align:start position:0%
bills an employee will earn more per
 
05:59:41.030 --> 05:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
hour but may end up earning less per
 
05:59:43.670 --> 05:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
week because the individual's hours have
 
05:59:43.680 --> 05:59:44.708 align:start position:0%
week because the individual's hours have
been

05:59:44.708 --> 05:59:44.718 align:start position:0%
been
 
05:59:48.030 --> 05:59:48.040 align:start position:0%
cut small businesses need to balance
 
05:59:51.270 --> 05:59:51.280 align:start position:0%
their budgets every day it is important
 
05:59:53.628 --> 05:59:53.638 align:start position:0%
to recognize that each dollar increase
 
05:59:57.030 --> 05:59:57.040 align:start position:0%
for a full-time minimum wage job can
 
06:00:01.230 --> 06:00:01.240 align:start position:0%
cost that employer over $2,200 per year
 
06:00:04.390 --> 06:00:04.400 align:start position:0%
you have the wage you have Medicare
 
06:00:06.390 --> 06:00:06.400 align:start position:0%
taxes and you have unemployment comp
 
06:00:09.110 --> 06:00:09.120 align:start position:0%
taxes plus workers comp
 
06:00:11.590 --> 06:00:11.600 align:start position:0%
insurance therefore these bills will
 
06:00:13.868 --> 06:00:13.878 align:start position:0%
cause approximately depending on which
 
06:00:17.628 --> 06:00:17.638 align:start position:0%
Bill and what increase between five and
 
06:00:23.030 --> 06:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:25.310 --> 06:00:25.320 align:start position:0%
employers it is important to remember
 
06:00:27.310 --> 06:00:27.320 align:start position:0%
that the minimum wage was never intended
 
06:00:29.548 --> 06:00:29.558 align:start position:0%
to to support entire
 
06:00:33.430 --> 06:00:33.440 align:start position:0%
families it was designed to be a
 
06:00:37.110 --> 06:00:37.120 align:start position:0%
draining wage it was designed to ensure
 
06:00:39.510 --> 06:00:39.520 align:start position:0%
a a
 
06:00:43.708 --> 06:00:43.718 align:start position:0%
base the proponents of 517 I applaud
 
06:00:46.310 --> 06:00:46.320 align:start position:0%
them because they recognize the true
 
06:00:49.230 --> 06:00:49.240 align:start position:0%
intent of a minimum wage through the new
 
06:00:51.350 --> 06:00:51.360 align:start position:0%
paragraph at the end of the bill that
 
06:00:54.110 --> 06:00:54.120 align:start position:0%
would establish a youth minimum
 
06:00:57.070 --> 06:00:57.080 align:start position:0%
wage in any discussions going forward
 
06:00:59.270 --> 06:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
this Vision needs to continue to be a
 
06:01:01.590 --> 06:01:01.600 align:start position:0%
part of that
 
06:01:04.110 --> 06:01:04.120 align:start position:0%
conversation prior to the pandemic
 
06:01:06.990 --> 06:01:07.000 align:start position:0%
reports showed that the lower
 
06:01:09.788 --> 06:01:09.798 align:start position:0%
25% of paid workers were seeing their
 
06:01:14.430 --> 06:01:14.440 align:start position:0%
wages rise faster than those in the top
 
06:01:16.910 --> 06:01:16.920 align:start position:0%
25% and that was occurring because of
 
06:01:19.390 --> 06:01:19.400 align:start position:0%
the competition by employers for
 
06:01:21.708 --> 06:01:21.718 align:start position:0%
employees there are so
 
06:01:24.350 --> 06:01:24.360 align:start position:0%
few really the statistics show that
 
06:01:27.070 --> 06:01:27.080 align:start position:0%
there are so few minimum wage employees
 
06:01:29.670 --> 06:01:29.680 align:start position:0%
in the Hampshire and in reality those
 
06:01:31.150 --> 06:01:31.160 align:start position:0%
statistics are
 
06:01:33.350 --> 06:01:33.360 align:start position:0%
representing those workers that your
 
06:01:36.390 --> 06:01:36.400 align:start position:0%
previous speaker just spoke to it's it's
 
06:01:39.590 --> 06:01:39.600 align:start position:0%
those in the hospitality world who are
 
06:01:42.510 --> 06:01:42.520 align:start position:0%
getting tips and and earning much more
 
06:01:43.868 --> 06:01:43.878 align:start position:0%
than the minimum
 
06:01:47.070 --> 06:01:47.080 align:start position:0%
wage so starting wages in New Hampshire
 
06:01:49.990 --> 06:01:50.000 align:start position:0%
are as high as they have ever been and
 
06:01:53.150 --> 06:01:53.160 align:start position:0%
they are far above the minimum wage a
 
06:01:55.788 --> 06:01:55.798 align:start position:0%
strong economy helped by not raising
 
06:01:58.230 --> 06:01:58.240 align:start position:0%
business taxes last year
 
06:02:00.708 --> 06:02:00.718 align:start position:0%
um the year before as well is helping
 
06:02:03.110 --> 06:02:03.120 align:start position:0%
all employees and businesses I mean look
 
06:02:06.150 --> 06:02:06.160 align:start position:0%
at New Hampshire where 4% unemployment
 
06:02:09.868 --> 06:02:09.878 align:start position:0%
during this pandemic we are in a good
 
06:02:12.548 --> 06:02:12.558 align:start position:0%
position here in the Northeast let's not
 
06:02:15.788 --> 06:02:15.798 align:start position:0%
Crush that we oppose these bills and we
 
06:02:17.788 --> 06:02:17.798 align:start position:0%
want to allow New Hampshire's markets to
 
06:02:20.830 --> 06:02:20.840 align:start position:0%
grow jobs and grow wages so businesses
 
06:02:23.590 --> 06:02:23.600 align:start position:0%
can continue to succeed thank you Mr
 
06:02:25.628 --> 06:02:25.638 align:start position:0%

the 2250 Bill be one
 
06:07:31.150 --> 06:07:31.160 align:start position:0%
hello my name is infinity sanderfer and
 
06:07:35.270 --> 06:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
I live in West Lebanon um I am
 
06:07:38.468 --> 06:07:38.478 align:start position:0%
representing myself as a poor person I
 
06:07:40.788 --> 06:07:40.798 align:start position:0%
last year made $15 an hour working
 
06:07:42.548 --> 06:07:42.558 align:start position:0%
full-time and I still qualified for cash
 
06:07:44.510 --> 06:07:44.520 align:start position:0%
assistance I have one child he's five
 
06:07:46.948 --> 06:07:46.958 align:start position:0%
years old um I've been working in child
 
06:07:50.350 --> 06:07:50.360 align:start position:0%
care um or resfit care type jobs for
 
06:07:53.150 --> 06:07:53.160 align:start position:0%
most of my life and for most of my life
 
06:07:55.670 --> 06:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
I have not made a living wage um we like
 
06:07:57.070 --> 06:07:57.080 align:start position:0%
to throw around a lot of different terms
 
06:08:00.510 --> 06:08:00.520 align:start position:0%
I feel like uh minimum wage has an idea
 
06:08:03.190 --> 06:08:03.200 align:start position:0%
tied to it that a living wage does not
 
06:08:05.430 --> 06:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
um and I can say that you're right a
 
06:08:07.430 --> 06:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
minimum wage is not capable of
 
06:08:09.590 --> 06:08:09.600 align:start position:0%
supporting a family but I as a single
 
06:08:11.310 --> 06:08:11.320 align:start position:0%
person should be capable of supporting a
 
06:08:14.350 --> 06:08:14.360 align:start position:0%
family um especially doing jobs that are
 
06:08:17.430 --> 06:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
important to the community um during the
 
06:08:20.510 --> 06:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
pandemic we saw a lot of folks that make
 
06:08:22.868 --> 06:08:22.878 align:start position:0%
um far below living wages being
 
06:08:25.788 --> 06:08:25.798 align:start position:0%
considered essential workers
 
06:08:25.798 --> 06:08:27.708 align:start position:0%
considered essential workers
and

06:08:27.708 --> 06:08:27.718 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:08:30.990 --> 06:08:31.000 align:start position:0%
um sorry
 
06:08:33.788 --> 06:08:33.798 align:start position:0%
um we we talk about how you know
 
06:08:35.070 --> 06:08:35.080 align:start position:0%
somebody at McDonald's shouldn't
 
06:08:37.628 --> 06:08:37.638 align:start position:0%
necessarily make as much as a CEO um but
 
06:08:40.350 --> 06:08:40.360 align:start position:0%
I'm not really sure why somebody's sweat
 
06:08:42.628 --> 06:08:42.638 align:start position:0%
at a drive-thru is worth less than
 
06:08:45.628 --> 06:08:45.638 align:start position:0%
somebody sweat in an office um I feel
 
06:08:47.830 --> 06:08:47.840 align:start position:0%
that you know we throw around these
 
06:08:51.548 --> 06:08:51.558 align:start position:0%
terms in hopes that we can kind of get
 
06:08:53.708 --> 06:08:53.718 align:start position:0%
around the issue of this is a moral
 
06:08:56.070 --> 06:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
issue being able to survive is a moral
 
06:08:58.628 --> 06:08:58.638 align:start position:0%
issue this is not you know worrying
 
06:09:00.030 --> 06:09:00.040 align:start position:0%
about somebody's pocket along the lines
 
06:09:01.430 --> 06:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
these are people who are showing up at
 
06:09:04.510 --> 06:09:04.520 align:start position:0%
food banks and on assistance and
 
06:09:06.468 --> 06:09:06.478 align:start position:0%
incapable of taking care of themselves
 
06:09:10.190 --> 06:09:10.200 align:start position:0%
if you pay people a a living wage then
 
06:09:11.830 --> 06:09:11.840 align:start position:0%
the cost of insurances and doctor's
 
06:09:14.230 --> 06:09:14.240 align:start position:0%
bills goes significantly down um you can
 
06:09:16.150 --> 06:09:16.160 align:start position:0%
save money in a lot of other areas just
 
06:09:18.270 --> 06:09:18.280 align:start position:0%
by providing people enough money to
 
06:09:21.230 --> 06:09:21.240 align:start position:0%
survive um I am in full support of a
 
06:09:24.670 --> 06:09:24.680 align:start position:0%
living wage um which we know is about 22
 
06:09:29.868 --> 06:09:29.878 align:start position:0%
to $23 an hour um and I
 
06:09:33.350 --> 06:09:33.360 align:start position:0%
really don't understand how the argument
 
06:09:35.390 --> 06:09:35.400 align:start position:0%
can get from you know the morality of
 
06:09:39.150 --> 06:09:39.160 align:start position:0%
survival to um you know pocketbooks
 
06:09:42.070 --> 06:09:42.080 align:start position:0%
these are two different conversations um
 
06:09:45.270 --> 06:09:45.280 align:start position:0%
Rich get rich literally off of the sweat
 
06:09:47.310 --> 06:09:47.320 align:start position:0%
of the folks working at Walmart
 
06:09:49.510 --> 06:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
McDonald's um and and these huge
 
06:09:51.788 --> 06:09:51.798 align:start position:0%
companies that don't pay living wages
 
06:09:54.910 --> 06:09:54.920 align:start position:0%
while Rich folk continue to get rich why
 
06:09:57.230 --> 06:09:57.240 align:start position:0%
um is there such a huge discrepancy in
 
06:09:59.670 --> 06:09:59.680 align:start position:0%
the worth of somebody's time an hours
 
06:10:00.990 --> 06:10:01.000 align:start position:0%
worth of time should be an hours worth
 
06:10:02.390 --> 06:10:02.400 align:start position:0%
of time regardless of what you were
 
06:10:06.230 --> 06:10:06.240 align:start position:0%
doing um and I feel like that's really
 
06:10:08.628 --> 06:10:08.638 align:start position:0%
um kind of important when we're talking
 
06:10:12.430 --> 06:10:12.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:15.070 --> 06:10:15.080 align:start position:0%

06:12:13.628 --> 06:12:13.638 align:start position:0%
had a minimum wage in the past um before
 
06:12:15.350 --> 06:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
removing it and defaulting to the
 
06:12:18.708 --> 06:12:18.718 align:start position:0%
federal one 725
 
06:12:23.430 --> 06:12:23.440 align:start position:0%
$725 an hour is irresponsible and in all
 
06:12:23.440 --> 06:12:24.390 align:start position:0%
$725 an hour is irresponsible and in all
kindness

06:12:24.390 --> 06:12:24.400 align:start position:0%
kindness
 
06:12:28.910 --> 06:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
inhumane we are a wealthy state but over
 
06:12:32.030 --> 06:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
130,000 people make less than $15 an
 
06:12:34.468 --> 06:12:34.478 align:start position:0%
hour in the granite state and what's
 
06:12:37.230 --> 06:12:37.240 align:start position:0%
really bizarre to me on that level not
 
06:12:39.030 --> 06:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
only does it make it difficult for
 
06:12:42.150 --> 06:12:42.160 align:start position:0%
families but the average citizen in New
 
06:12:44.788 --> 06:12:44.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire actually supports bringing
 
06:12:47.468 --> 06:12:47.478 align:start position:0%
back a New Hampshire minimum wage that
 
06:12:52.670 --> 06:12:52.680 align:start position:0%
is uh much higher than 725 an hour um
 
06:12:55.350 --> 06:12:55.360 align:start position:0%
hang on just a
 
06:13:00.230 --> 06:13:00.240 align:start position:0%
second sorry about that um I also just
 
06:13:01.830 --> 06:13:01.840 align:start position:0%
for the record want to say I also
 
06:13:03.628 --> 06:13:03.638 align:start position:0%
support the other Bill the other Bill
 
06:13:06.190 --> 06:13:06.200 align:start position:0%
gets closer to a living wage but in all
 
06:13:09.270 --> 06:13:09.280 align:start position:0%
honesty um if you look at the MIT living
 
06:13:10.788 --> 06:13:10.798 align:start position:0%
wage calculator which I know
 
06:13:13.590 --> 06:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt mentioned earlier
 
06:13:16.670 --> 06:13:16.680 align:start position:0%
I'm GNA send a few links to a few New
 
06:13:19.150 --> 06:13:19.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire specific data from that
 
06:13:21.548 --> 06:13:21.558 align:start position:0%
because it really does a great job of
 
06:13:27.150 --> 06:13:27.160 align:start position:0%
showing uh What It Is by estimates uh an
 
06:13:30.788 --> 06:13:30.798 align:start position:0%
actual living wage uh in most parts of
 
06:13:32.990 --> 06:13:33.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire it is generalized though
 
06:13:37.110 --> 06:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
by County so um do see that with a grain
 
06:13:40.590 --> 06:13:40.600 align:start position:0%
of salt that's uh Waters it down a bit
 
06:13:42.868 --> 06:13:42.878 align:start position:0%
you know comparing a an expensive place
 
06:13:45.070 --> 06:13:45.080 align:start position:0%
like Portsmouth to other parts of that
 
06:13:47.310 --> 06:13:47.320 align:start position:0%
County uh and it's true in pretty much
 
06:13:50.270 --> 06:13:50.280 align:start position:0%
every County but anyway looking at that
 
06:13:52.430 --> 06:13:52.440 align:start position:0%
uh the minimum wage of
 
06:13:56.868 --> 06:13:56.878 align:start position:0%
$725 an hour uh is below the poverty
 
06:14:01.390 --> 06:14:01.400 align:start position:0%
rate um and in general for the whole
 
06:14:05.390 --> 06:14:05.400 align:start position:0%
state a a living wage for if you average
 
06:14:07.830 --> 06:14:07.840 align:start position:0%
everywhere in New Hampshire for a family
 
06:14:10.350 --> 06:14:10.360 align:start position:0%
of three one child with two parents with
 
06:14:13.948 --> 06:14:13.958 align:start position:0%
one of the parents working it's uh about
 
06:14:16.430 --> 06:14:16.440 align:start position:0%
$54,000 a year as a living wage that's
 
06:14:19.750 --> 06:14:19.760 align:start position:0%
just for rent food the absolute Basics
 
06:14:22.990 --> 06:14:23.000 align:start position:0%
that doesn't include a a cable package
 
06:14:25.390 --> 06:14:25.400 align:start position:0%
it doesn't include student loans it
 
06:14:28.390 --> 06:14:28.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't include expensive medical debt
 
06:14:31.030 --> 06:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
it doesn't include saving for
 
06:14:34.150 --> 06:14:34.160 align:start position:0%
emergencies or uh
 
06:14:37.910 --> 06:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
retirement um it in all kinds of things
 
06:14:40.110 --> 06:14:40.120 align:start position:0%
so I do want to Pivot and say some good
 
06:14:43.788 --> 06:14:43.798 align:start position:0%
news and that is because the fight for
 
06:14:46.070 --> 06:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
15 has been successful in a lot of
 
06:14:49.070 --> 06:14:49.080 align:start position:0%
places in America whether it's on many
 
06:14:52.990 --> 06:14:53.000 align:start position:0%
cities or states we've been able to do a
 
06:14:55.468 --> 06:14:55.478 align:start position:0%
lot of interesting studies in America
 
06:14:59.150 --> 06:14:59.160 align:start position:0%
that compare those economies to the ones
 
06:15:02.468 --> 06:15:02.478 align:start position:0%
like ours and by the way we are in a sad
 
06:15:04.590 --> 06:15:04.600 align:start position:0%
little donut here with everybody around
 
06:15:06.868 --> 06:15:06.878 align:start position:0%
us paying significantly better and
 
06:15:09.830 --> 06:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
having a better um Quality of Life as a
 
06:15:12.310 --> 06:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
result but the good going back to the
 
06:15:16.230 --> 06:15:16.240 align:start position:0%
good news we know that while for the
 
06:15:20.590 --> 06:15:20.600 align:start position:0%
initial um implementation of a decent uh
 
06:15:23.350 --> 06:15:23.360 align:start position:0%
raise like my bill does which starts at
 
06:15:25.910 --> 06:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
over $112 an hour which puts us in a
 
06:15:27.390 --> 06:15:27.400 align:start position:0%
line with our
 
06:15:32.230 --> 06:15:32.240 align:start position:0%
neighbors um there is a short period a
 
06:15:34.910 --> 06:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
maybe months or less where there is a
 
06:15:38.468 --> 06:15:38.478 align:start position:0%
bit of an adjustment but very quickly
 
06:15:42.150 --> 06:15:42.160 align:start position:0%
the economy rebounds and does very well
 
06:15:44.110 --> 06:15:44.120 align:start position:0%
because the majority of money that a
 
06:15:47.150 --> 06:15:47.160 align:start position:0%
low- wage worker earns is spent and put
 
06:15:49.628 --> 06:15:49.638 align:start position:0%
right back into the economy
 
06:15:52.868 --> 06:15:52.878 align:start position:0%
immediately and uh entrepreneurship
 
06:15:54.830 --> 06:15:54.840 align:start position:0%
actually goes up contrary to what a
 
06:15:56.750 --> 06:15:56.760 align:start position:0%
previous speaker was saying
 
06:15:59.510 --> 06:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
if you pay people a living wage if you
 
06:16:02.708 --> 06:16:02.718 align:start position:0%
pay them uh a better wage they actually
 
06:16:06.310 --> 06:16:06.320 align:start position:0%
then can start jobs and can start
 
06:16:09.270 --> 06:16:09.280 align:start position:0%
companies or go off on their own and
 
06:16:11.948 --> 06:16:11.958 align:start position:0%
freelance and live a better wage after
 
06:16:14.310 --> 06:16:14.320 align:start position:0%
that it gives them a spring off point to
 
06:16:16.510 --> 06:16:16.520 align:start position:0%
do that it here's two of the more
 
06:16:19.030 --> 06:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
interesting ones comparing again the
 
06:16:21.310 --> 06:16:21.320 align:start position:0%
places where the fight for 15 has been
 
06:16:25.548 --> 06:16:25.558 align:start position:0%
successful and the economy like ours uh
 
06:16:29.430 --> 06:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
where they raised the wage it this
 
06:16:31.990 --> 06:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
significant reduction in the number of
 
06:16:34.670 --> 06:16:34.680 align:start position:0%
suicides in in those communities
 
06:16:39.270 --> 06:16:39.280 align:start position:0%
compared to our economy and even uh a
 
06:16:41.548 --> 06:16:41.558 align:start position:0%
significant decrease in unwanted
 
06:16:44.150 --> 06:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
pregnancies because go figure most of
 
06:16:47.468 --> 06:16:47.478 align:start position:0%
the people who earn low wages are women
 
06:16:50.030 --> 06:16:50.040 align:start position:0%
and they can afford to have the babies
 
06:16:52.030 --> 06:16:52.040 align:start position:0%
so I can send you the links to those
 
06:16:54.628 --> 06:16:54.638 align:start position:0%
studies if you like that um I also want
 
06:16:56.390 --> 06:16:56.400 align:start position:0%
to address one other point from a
 
06:16:58.468 --> 06:16:58.478 align:start position:0%
previous speaker who was speaking about
 
06:17:01.350 --> 06:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
this bill and the previous Bill and
 
06:17:03.390 --> 06:17:03.400 align:start position:0%
talked about a training wage and I just
 
06:17:06.708 --> 06:17:06.718 align:start position:0%
felt uh a little frustrated because
 
06:17:10.070 --> 06:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
there's this notion that well if you
 
06:17:12.350 --> 06:17:12.360 align:start position:0%
want to make more and you want to better
 
06:17:14.468 --> 06:17:14.478 align:start position:0%
job you should just go get a better job
 
06:17:16.230 --> 06:17:16.240 align:start position:0%
and I think that there's a real problem
 
06:17:20.708 --> 06:17:20.718 align:start position:0%
with that Society um I come I the first
 
06:17:23.430 --> 06:17:23.440 align:start position:0%
in my family to get a college education
 
06:17:26.270 --> 06:17:26.280 align:start position:0%
but my parents were very happy to be a
 
06:17:29.310 --> 06:17:29.320 align:start position:0%
baggage handler and a school secretary
 
06:17:31.788 --> 06:17:31.798 align:start position:0%
and they liked their jobs they had no
 
06:17:35.310 --> 06:17:35.320 align:start position:0%
desire to do anything else actually and
 
06:17:37.150 --> 06:17:37.160 align:start position:0%
they were able to do that for most of
 
06:17:40.110 --> 06:17:40.120 align:start position:0%
their careers and I think that it's been
 
06:17:42.670 --> 06:17:42.680 align:start position:0%
true in American history that if you
 
06:17:45.110 --> 06:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
want to work at a store or if you want
 
06:17:48.070 --> 06:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
to work as a home care Aid or a child
 
06:17:50.110 --> 06:17:50.120 align:start position:0%
care worker all of those are jobs that
 
06:17:52.548 --> 06:17:52.558 align:start position:0%
tend to be very low wage in our current
 
06:17:56.230 --> 06:17:56.240 align:start position:0%
economy for many people that's a calling
 
06:17:58.590 --> 06:17:58.600 align:start position:0%
and I think this country needs to change
 
06:18:00.990 --> 06:18:01.000 align:start position:0%
our attitude about that and go to what
 
06:18:02.990 --> 06:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
Martin Luther King Jr said that all
 
06:18:06.830 --> 06:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
labor has dignity every job that someone
 
06:18:10.110 --> 06:18:10.120 align:start position:0%
has created in and of itself should be
 
06:18:12.910 --> 06:18:12.920 align:start position:0%
seen with dignity and we should pay the
 
06:18:15.990 --> 06:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
wages that should match that dignity and
 
06:18:19.270 --> 06:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
not have people needing to file uh go
 
06:18:20.830 --> 06:18:20.840 align:start position:0%
for government assistance when they're
 
06:18:24.390 --> 06:18:24.400 align:start position:0%
working full-time I find that disgusting
 
06:18:27.390 --> 06:18:27.400 align:start position:0%
I find that immoral and we have the
 
06:18:30.708 --> 06:18:30.718 align:start position:0%
ability to do right by that to make sure
 
06:18:33.230 --> 06:18:33.240 align:start position:0%
that instead of giving backdoor
 
06:18:35.910 --> 06:18:35.920 align:start position:0%
corporate Weare to places like Walmart
 
06:18:37.590 --> 06:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
who teach their employees and they're
 
06:18:40.110 --> 06:18:40.120 align:start position:0%
not the only ones to go on public
 
06:18:42.670 --> 06:18:42.680 align:start position:0%
assistance then they get state grants
 
06:18:45.270 --> 06:18:45.280 align:start position:0%
from the state of New Hampshire um I can
 
06:18:47.150 --> 06:18:47.160 align:start position:0%
get you that data and that
 
06:18:50.670 --> 06:18:50.680 align:start position:0%
substantiation for a whole ton of money
 
06:18:52.708 --> 06:18:52.718 align:start position:0%
and then cause a difficulty for their
 
06:18:56.150 --> 06:18:56.160 align:start position:0%
workers when we know that uh there a
 
06:18:58.910 --> 06:18:58.920 align:start position:0%
stigma Associated to getting Public
 
06:19:02.390 --> 06:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
Assistance um I would say many low-wage
 
06:19:04.708 --> 06:19:04.718 align:start position:0%
workers who have to apply for assistance
 
06:19:06.830 --> 06:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
have their own inner voice of a tea
 
06:19:09.830 --> 06:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
party person telling them uh what a
 
06:19:11.910 --> 06:19:11.920 align:start position:0%
failure they are when in fact they
 
06:19:13.830 --> 06:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
should have dignity and be paid a living
 
06:19:16.750 --> 06:19:16.760 align:start position:0%
wage which is just which is fair which
 
06:19:20.110 --> 06:19:20.120 align:start position:0%
is good for the economy reduces suicides
 
06:19:22.310 --> 06:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
and a lot of other good things we're far
 
06:19:25.430 --> 06:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
overdue to bring back in New Hampshire
 
06:19:28.670 --> 06:19:28.680 align:start position:0%
uh minimum wage and if um I could go on
 
06:19:31.670 --> 06:19:31.680 align:start position:0%
for much longer but I will stop my
 
06:19:33.350 --> 06:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
remarks and take any questions anyone
 
06:19:33.360 --> 06:19:35.350 align:start position:0%
remarks and take any questions anyone
may

06:19:35.350 --> 06:19:35.360 align:start position:0%
may
 
06:19:37.590 --> 06:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
have all right thank you representative

testimony are there any questions for
 
06:19:44.670 --> 06:19:44.680 align:start position:0%

06:20:14.430 --> 06:20:14.440 align:start position:0%
recognized and I don't know if you're
 
06:20:16.150 --> 06:20:16.160 align:start position:0%
close enough to Mike do you have one
 
06:20:22.070 --> 06:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:24.270 --> 06:20:24.280 align:start position:0%
you thank the representative for taking
 
06:20:26.510 --> 06:20:26.520 align:start position:0%
my question um I want to
 
06:20:28.830 --> 06:20:28.840 align:start position:0%
give you a quote and I'm wondering if
 
06:20:30.590 --> 06:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
you can tell me who said
 
06:20:35.310 --> 06:20:35.320 align:start position:0%
it okay the minimum has to go up at
 
06:20:39.230 --> 06:20:39.240 align:start position:0%
least 10 federally but it has to go up
 
06:20:40.750 --> 06:20:40.760 align:start position:0%
can you tell me who said
 
06:20:44.670 --> 06:20:44.680 align:start position:0%
that um gonna guess Ronald
 
06:20:47.270 --> 06:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
Reagan I honestly I don't
 
06:20:50.310 --> 06:20:50.320 align:start position:0%
know yes would you believe me if I told
 
06:20:52.310 --> 06:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
you that that was former president
 
06:20:56.150 --> 06:20:56.160 align:start position:0%
Trump I I would actually yes just one
 
06:20:59.230 --> 06:20:59.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:02.350 --> 06:21:02.360 align:start position:0%
you if this is going to turn into a big
 
06:21:06.990 --> 06:21:07.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:09.110 --> 06:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
support go ahead
 
06:21:12.030 --> 06:21:12.040 align:start position:0%
follow I can tell you that there are a
 
06:21:14.270 --> 06:21:14.280 align:start position:0%
lot of low wage workers among the
 
06:21:16.270 --> 06:21:16.280 align:start position:0%
supporters of Donald Trump so this would
 
06:21:17.990 --> 06:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
actually help them that's part of my
 
06:21:21.868 --> 06:21:21.878 align:start position:0%
followup um in 2020 the State of Florida
 
06:21:24.628 --> 06:21:24.638 align:start position:0%
voted for President Trump uh by four and
 
06:21:26.350 --> 06:21:26.360 align:start position:0%
a half percent
 
06:21:29.230 --> 06:21:29.240 align:start position:0%
um at the same time the State of Florida
 
06:21:32.310 --> 06:21:32.320 align:start position:0%
passed with 60% of the vote enough for a
 
06:21:34.708 --> 06:21:34.718 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment a minimum wage
 
06:21:39.230 --> 06:21:39.240 align:start position:0%
of $15 an hour jumping from $8.50 an
 
06:21:43.350 --> 06:21:43.360 align:start position:0%
hour to $15 an hour so do you believe
 
06:21:46.270 --> 06:21:46.280 align:start position:0%
there is a possibility for a broad
 
06:21:48.910 --> 06:21:48.920 align:start position:0%
bipartisan consensus on an issue like
 
06:21:52.310 --> 06:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
the minimum wage I absolutely do and I
 
06:21:55.230 --> 06:21:55.240 align:start position:0%
know that there has been polling in New
 
06:21:55.240 --> 06:21:56.150 align:start position:0%
know that there has been polling in New
Hampshire

06:21:56.150 --> 06:21:56.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
06:22:00.030 --> 06:22:00.040 align:start position:0%
where um it was a poll in
 
06:22:05.590 --> 06:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
2019 of New Hampshire voters and even
 
06:22:10.310 --> 06:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
over 60% of Republican voters in New
 
06:22:13.230 --> 06:22:13.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire support bringing back a New
 
06:22:15.628 --> 06:22:15.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire minimum wage that is
 
06:22:17.830 --> 06:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
significantly higher than the current
 
06:22:20.990 --> 06:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
federal rate and I don't understand why
 
06:22:23.030 --> 06:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
that hasn't shown up in the polling of
 
06:22:25.190 --> 06:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
SE Governor but yes you're absolutely
 
06:22:29.310 --> 06:22:29.320 align:start position:0%

campaigning to represent this ward in
 
06:23:19.468 --> 06:23:19.478 align:start position:0%
for the house I met
 
06:23:22.070 --> 06:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
constituents that are struggling to make
 
06:23:25.990 --> 06:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
ins meet even while working two to three
 
06:23:30.830 --> 06:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
jobs I supported a $15 minimum wage
 
06:23:33.750 --> 06:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
during our last session as well as
 
06:23:36.788 --> 06:23:36.798 align:start position:0%

06:23:55.868 --> 06:23:55.878 align:start position:0%
struggle to put food on their table and
 
06:23:59.670 --> 06:23:59.680 align:start position:0%
pay their rent and we should be trying
 
06:24:02.830 --> 06:24:02.840 align:start position:0%
to make a goal to create a living wage

straford
 
06:24:51.708 --> 06:24:51.718 align:start position:0%
16 um as a general rule one should
 
06:24:54.190 --> 06:24:54.200 align:start position:0%
expend no more than 30% of one's gross
 
06:24:56.990 --> 06:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
monthly income on housing if one is a
 
06:24:59.868 --> 06:24:59.878 align:start position:0%
renter that 30% should include utilities
 
06:25:01.708 --> 06:25:01.718 align:start position:0%
and if one is an owner it should include
 
06:25:03.628 --> 06:25:03.638 align:start position:0%
other Home Ownership costs like morgage
 
06:25:05.590 --> 06:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
interest property taxes and
 
06:25:07.750 --> 06:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
maintenance I've done some research and
 
06:25:09.750 --> 06:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
found the average rent not including
 
06:25:11.788 --> 06:25:11.798 align:start position:0%
Utilities in several towns across the
 
06:25:13.670 --> 06:25:13.680 align:start position:0%
state I'd like to share with you what I
 
06:25:17.468 --> 06:25:17.478 align:start position:0%
found the average rent in Manchester is
 
06:25:19.830 --> 06:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
$1,431 in Dover it's
 
06:25:22.510 --> 06:25:22.520 align:start position:0%
1485 in conquered it's
 
06:25:25.628 --> 06:25:25.638 align:start position:0%
1225 nsha miramac and Portsmouth come in
 
06:25:25.638 --> 06:25:26.708 align:start position:0%
1225 nsha miramac and Portsmouth come in
around,

06:25:26.708 --> 06:25:26.718 align:start position:0%
around,
 
06:25:30.110 --> 06:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
1670 Rochester Hudson Temple and Laconia
 
06:25:32.510 --> 06:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
figure around 1,200 with Belmont coming
 
06:25:34.270 --> 06:25:34.280 align:start position:0%
in a little lower at
 
06:25:37.390 --> 06:25:37.400 align:start position:0%
1185 godown and Guilford rentals can be
 
06:25:40.390 --> 06:25:40.400 align:start position:0%
had at an average of about 1150 or so
 
06:25:43.510 --> 06:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
rent in Lebanon is about
 
06:25:46.230 --> 06:25:46.240 align:start position:0%
$1,955 Berlin and Goram come in the
 
06:25:47.868 --> 06:25:47.878 align:start position:0%
least expensive towns of those I
 
06:25:50.868 --> 06:25:50.878 align:start position:0%
researched Berlin's rent is about $940
 
06:25:52.548 --> 06:25:52.558 align:start position:0%
and gorm's is about
 
06:25:55.350 --> 06:25:55.360 align:start position:0%
700 remember these are all figures from
 
06:25:57.750 --> 06:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
rent alone and don't include any
 
06:26:00.070 --> 06:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
utilities in every single one of those
 
06:26:02.070 --> 06:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
towns with the exceptions of Berlin and
 
06:26:04.150 --> 06:26:04.160 align:start position:0%
Goram one would have to earn at least
 
06:26:06.310 --> 06:26:06.320 align:start position:0%
$20 an hour to come in at a 30%
 
06:26:08.910 --> 06:26:08.920 align:start position:0%
recommendation referenced above in order
 
06:26:10.910 --> 06:26:10.920 align:start position:0%
to live in Lebanon one needs to earn
 
06:26:14.510 --> 06:26:14.520 align:start position:0%
closer to $34 an hour NASA and marac and
 
06:26:16.868 --> 06:26:16.878 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth rent would require about $28
 
06:26:19.270 --> 06:26:19.280 align:start position:0%
an hour and to live in my city of Dober
 
06:26:22.708 --> 06:26:22.718 align:start position:0%
one needs to earn about $25 an hour even
 
06:26:24.070 --> 06:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
living in the least expensive
 
06:26:25.350 --> 06:26:25.360 align:start position:0%
communities I researched with would
 
06:26:28.070 --> 06:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
require a salary of at least $113 an
 
06:26:30.070 --> 06:26:30.080 align:start position:0%
hour a figure well above the current
 
06:26:31.510 --> 06:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
minimum wage of
 
06:26:34.788 --> 06:26:34.798 align:start position:0%
725 that's just rent that figure doesn't
 
06:26:37.270 --> 06:26:37.280 align:start position:0%
cover utilities or groceries or
 
06:26:39.190 --> 06:26:39.200 align:start position:0%
insurance or Transportation costs or
 
06:26:41.190 --> 06:26:41.200 align:start position:0%
child care or any of the other expenses
 
06:26:42.670 --> 06:26:42.680 align:start position:0%
that come with basic
 
06:26:45.468 --> 06:26:45.478 align:start position:0%
survival it's my contention and I would
 
06:26:47.750 --> 06:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
Hazard guess that my co-sponsors of both
 
06:26:49.468 --> 06:26:49.478 align:start position:0%
of these minimum wage bills would agree
 
06:26:50.708 --> 06:26:50.718 align:start position:0%
though I wouldn't Dain to put words in
 
06:26:53.350 --> 06:26:53.360 align:start position:0%
their mouths that all workers deserve a
 
06:26:56.750 --> 06:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
livable wage if a job needs doing the
 
06:26:58.430 --> 06:26:58.440 align:start position:0%
person doing that job should be fairly
 
06:27:00.670 --> 06:27:00.680 align:start position:0%
compensated and by fairly compensated I
 
06:27:02.150 --> 06:27:02.160 align:start position:0%
mean they should be earning enough to
 
06:27:03.590 --> 06:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
thrive in the communities where they
 
06:27:05.910 --> 06:27:05.920 align:start position:0%
work we worry an awful lot about what
 
06:27:08.190 --> 06:27:08.200 align:start position:0%
raising wages will do to businesses I
 
06:27:09.510 --> 06:27:09.520 align:start position:0%
think it's long past time we start
 
06:27:11.150 --> 06:27:11.160 align:start position:0%
asking why it is that these businesses
 
06:27:12.788 --> 06:27:12.798 align:start position:0%
aren't able to pay wages that ensure
 
06:27:14.750 --> 06:27:14.760 align:start position:0%
that their workers are able to live safe
 
06:27:18.030 --> 06:27:18.040 align:start position:0%
and dignified lives thank

Association SEIU Local
 
06:32:47.910 --> 06:32:47.920 align:start position:0%
1984 we represent the majority of state
 
06:32:49.788 --> 06:32:49.798 align:start position:0%
employees as well as workers in some of
 
06:32:51.830 --> 06:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
our states counties and
 
06:32:53.910 --> 06:32:53.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities and again I'm speaking in
 
06:32:56.510 --> 06:32:56.520 align:start position:0%
favor of house Bill 107 I'm here because
 
06:32:58.350 --> 06:32:58.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's low wage workers deserve
 
06:33:00.948 --> 06:33:00.958 align:start position:0%
a raise I support reestablishing a
 
06:33:03.190 --> 06:33:03.200 align:start position:0%
Granite State minimum wage and raising
 
06:33:04.830 --> 06:33:04.840 align:start position:0%
it in order to lift up all of New
 
06:33:07.230 --> 06:33:07.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's families the federal minimum
 
06:33:10.788 --> 06:33:10.798 align:start position:0%
wage which are now stuck at without our
 
06:33:15.150 --> 06:33:15.160 align:start position:0%
own has been stuck at 725 since 2009
 
06:33:17.628 --> 06:33:17.638 align:start position:0%
meanwhile the cost of everything is gone
 
06:33:23.548 --> 06:33:23.558 align:start position:0%
up milk bread eggs rent electricity and
 
06:33:25.788 --> 06:33:25.798 align:start position:0%
believe it or not even with the recent
 
06:33:28.230 --> 06:33:28.240 align:start position:0%
dip in fuel prices gasoline and Home
 
06:33:30.110 --> 06:33:30.120 align:start position:0%
Heating oils are still more expensive
 
06:33:33.788 --> 06:33:33.798 align:start position:0%
today than in 2009 in fact since the
 
06:33:36.150 --> 06:33:36.160 align:start position:0%
1960s the minimum wage has lost almost
 
06:33:39.510 --> 06:33:39.520 align:start position:0%
50% of its purchasing power the failing
 
06:33:41.350 --> 06:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
value of minimum wage is hurting
 
06:33:42.868 --> 06:33:42.878 align:start position:0%
thousands of New Hampshire's Working
 
06:33:44.628 --> 06:33:44.638 align:start position:0%
Families and eroding the stability of
 
06:33:44.638 --> 06:33:45.430 align:start position:0%
Families and eroding the stability of
our

06:33:45.430 --> 06:33:45.440 align:start position:0%
our
 
06:33:47.708 --> 06:33:47.718 align:start position:0%
communities that's because contrary to
 
06:33:50.670 --> 06:33:50.680 align:start position:0%
popular myth almost 90% of the impact of
 
06:33:52.750 --> 06:33:52.760 align:start position:0%
minimum wage is on workers over the age
 
06:33:56.270 --> 06:33:56.280 align:start position:0%
of 20 and more than 50% are women many
 
06:33:56.280 --> 06:33:57.150 align:start position:0%
of 20 and more than 50% are women many
with

06:33:57.150 --> 06:33:57.160 align:start position:0%
with
 
06:33:59.310 --> 06:33:59.320 align:start position:0%
children as a store manager at one of
 
06:34:01.150 --> 06:34:01.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's liquor stores I have
 
06:34:03.670 --> 06:34:03.680 align:start position:0%
worked personally and known many minimum
 
06:34:06.070 --> 06:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
wage workers part-time clerks some
 
06:34:07.948 --> 06:34:07.958 align:start position:0%
working two or three jobs to make ends
 
06:34:10.750 --> 06:34:10.760 align:start position:0%
meet a mom who was working part-time for
 
06:34:12.310 --> 06:34:12.320 align:start position:0%
me once told me that it wasn't her
 
06:34:14.110 --> 06:34:14.120 align:start position:0%
health benefits that she wanted but more
 
06:34:16.388 --> 06:34:16.398 align:start position:0%
hours so she could put more food on the
 
06:34:19.190 --> 06:34:19.200 align:start position:0%
table for her five children and I cannot
 
06:34:21.910 --> 06:34:21.920 align:start position:0%
begin to tell you how many young adults
 
06:34:23.510 --> 06:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
I have met who were still living with
 
06:34:26.628 --> 06:34:26.638 align:start position:0%
their parents and worse parents who have
 
06:34:28.350 --> 06:34:28.360 align:start position:0%
been forced to live with their
 
06:34:31.150 --> 06:34:31.160 align:start position:0%
children as a New Hampshire citizen I'm
 
06:34:33.310 --> 06:34:33.320 align:start position:0%
frankly outraged by how many large
 
06:34:35.388 --> 06:34:35.398 align:start position:0%
companies are exploiting workers and and
 
06:34:37.708 --> 06:34:37.718 align:start position:0%
the state people should not be choosing
 
06:34:40.070 --> 06:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
between healthc care and food workers
 
06:34:41.670 --> 06:34:41.680 align:start position:0%
should not have to receive guidance on
 
06:34:43.230 --> 06:34:43.240 align:start position:0%
how they apply for
 
06:34:45.788 --> 06:34:45.798 align:start position:0%
assistance as part of their company's
 
06:34:48.548 --> 06:34:48.558 align:start position:0%
orientation we are better than this and
 
06:34:50.070 --> 06:34:50.080 align:start position:0%
as president of one of the largest
 
06:34:52.070 --> 06:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
unions in the state I am determined to
 
06:34:54.788 --> 06:34:54.798 align:start position:0%
change it we believe that height is
 
06:34:56.948 --> 06:34:56.958 align:start position:0%
turning on this issue already we are
 
06:34:58.670 --> 06:34:58.680 align:start position:0%
seeing companies large and small moving
 
06:35:00.750 --> 06:35:00.760 align:start position:0%
to raise the wages of workers and
 
06:35:02.628 --> 06:35:02.638 align:start position:0%
supporting an increase in the minimum
 
06:35:05.628 --> 06:35:05.638 align:start position:0%
wage companies like McDonald's and Ikea
 
06:35:07.150 --> 06:35:07.160 align:start position:0%
are supporting a raise of the minimum
 
06:35:09.030 --> 06:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
wage and we all know that Costco has
 
06:35:11.110 --> 06:35:11.120 align:start position:0%
proven that even a living wage business
 
06:35:13.388 --> 06:35:13.398 align:start position:0%
model can flourish in our
 
06:35:16.628 --> 06:35:16.638 align:start position:0%
economy the people are also speaking out
 
06:35:18.310 --> 06:35:18.320 align:start position:0%
fast food workers are organizing in
 
06:35:20.910 --> 06:35:20.920 align:start position:0%
demanding action and more than 75% of
 
06:35:22.628 --> 06:35:22.638 align:start position:0%
American public support raising the
 
06:35:25.468 --> 06:35:25.478 align:start position:0%
minimum wage all all across this country
 
06:35:27.510 --> 06:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
coalitions are working tiously and
 
06:35:29.990 --> 06:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
successfully 22 states have passed a
 
06:35:32.350 --> 06:35:32.360 align:start position:0%
minimum wage higher than the federal
 
06:35:34.350 --> 06:35:34.360 align:start position:0%
rate you have in front of you a
 
06:35:34.360 --> 06:35:35.628 align:start position:0%
rate you have in front of you a
significant

06:35:35.628 --> 06:35:35.638 align:start position:0%
significant
 
06:35:38.510 --> 06:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity the minimum wage was enacted
 
06:35:40.350 --> 06:35:40.360 align:start position:0%
nearly 80 years ago by President
 
06:35:43.990 --> 06:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
Roosevelt with broad bipartisan support
 
06:35:46.430 --> 06:35:46.440 align:start position:0%
it has been raised over the years again
 
06:35:48.990 --> 06:35:49.000 align:start position:0%
with bipartisan support because both
 
06:35:51.070 --> 06:35:51.080 align:start position:0%
political parties have understood that
 
06:35:53.310 --> 06:35:53.320 align:start position:0%
raising the tide lifts all
 
06:35:57.110 --> 06:35:57.120 align:start position:0%
boats a minimum wage ear earner Works
 
06:36:01.190 --> 06:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
$14,500 per year you have an opportunity
 
06:36:04.110 --> 06:36:04.120 align:start position:0%
to change that to make it better make it
 
06:36:06.788 --> 06:36:06.798 align:start position:0%
better for all of us I have been very
 
06:36:08.350 --> 06:36:08.360 align:start position:0%
fortunate to work for the state of New
 
06:36:11.190 --> 06:36:11.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and thanks to my union there
 
06:36:12.830 --> 06:36:12.840 align:start position:0%
are no minimum wage jobs in our
 
06:36:16.310 --> 06:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
bargaining unit but today our voices are
 
06:36:17.868 --> 06:36:17.878 align:start position:0%
with the growing chorus of the public
 
06:36:20.350 --> 06:36:20.360 align:start position:0%
who want the minimum wage raised it is
 
06:36:22.468 --> 06:36:22.478 align:start position:0%
time to give the people of our state a
 
06:36:25.510 --> 06:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
raise with that I conclude my testimony
 
06:36:28.190 --> 06:36:28.200 align:start position:0%
and thank you right thank you for your
 
06:36:31.670 --> 06:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
testimony um I see a question here in
 
06:36:34.750 --> 06:36:34.760 align:start position:0%
the committee room for uh the witness
 
06:36:36.788 --> 06:36:36.798 align:start position:0%
representative Edon thank you Mr
 
06:36:38.830 --> 06:36:38.840 align:start position:0%
chairman uh thank you for taking the
 
06:36:41.110 --> 06:36:41.120 align:start position:0%
question Mr Gilla um one of the
 
06:36:44.070 --> 06:36:44.080 align:start position:0%
criticisms of an increase in the minimum
 
06:36:44.080 --> 06:36:45.110 align:start position:0%
criticisms of an increase in the minimum
wage

06:36:45.110 --> 06:36:45.120 align:start position:0%
wage
 
06:36:46.990 --> 06:36:47.000 align:start position:0%
consistently um is that it would
 
06:36:50.150 --> 06:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
obliterate jobs and raise Unemployment
 
06:36:51.670 --> 06:36:51.680 align:start position:0%
uh however in my research the other
 
06:36:55.548 --> 06:36:55.558 align:start position:0%
night I noticed that the u a Australia
 
06:36:58.230 --> 06:36:58.240 align:start position:0%
has a minimum wage of
 
06:37:01.150 --> 06:37:01.160 align:start position:0%
$19.84 an hour and they have the same
 
06:37:04.510 --> 06:37:04.520 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate as the United States
 
06:37:07.948 --> 06:37:07.958 align:start position:0%
uh do you think that the um line of
 
06:37:09.430 --> 06:37:09.440 align:start position:0%
argument that this would be a job
 
06:37:12.310 --> 06:37:12.320 align:start position:0%
Destroyer is an accurate one I'd have to
 
06:37:14.708 --> 06:37:14.718 align:start position:0%
research that more I don't but I'd have
 
06:37:18.150 --> 06:37:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:20.750 --> 06:37:20.760 align:start position:0%
you any other questions from the
 
06:37:20.760 --> 06:37:22.310 align:start position:0%
you any other questions from the
committee

06:37:22.310 --> 06:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
committee
 
06:37:27.830 --> 06:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:31.510 --> 06:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
online I see no hands raised so I thank
 
06:37:34.948 --> 06:37:34.958 align:start position:0%
you for the testimony thank you could
 
06:37:37.830 --> 06:37:37.840 align:start position:0%
you give us our next speaker
 
06:37:41.628 --> 06:37:41.638 align:start position:0%
please I have Jane
 
06:37:43.708 --> 06:37:43.718 align:start position:0%
Hay all
 
06:37:51.868 --> 06:37:51.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:54.750 --> 06:37:54.760 align:start position:0%
correct it appears there okay yeah it's
 
06:37:57.070 --> 06:37:57.080 align:start position:0%
hay like the General
 
06:38:00.270 --> 06:38:00.280 align:start position:0%
Alexander um hi there I'm just speaking
 
06:38:02.350 --> 06:38:02.360 align:start position:0%
for myself I live in
 
06:38:05.468 --> 06:38:05.478 align:start position:0%
Manchester and um I just think everybody
 
06:38:07.948 --> 06:38:07.958 align:start position:0%
that works needs to have a living
 
06:38:11.948 --> 06:38:11.958 align:start position:0%
wage um representative Frost discussed
 
06:38:15.310 --> 06:38:15.320 align:start position:0%
the amount of rent that people pay Etc
 
06:38:18.468 --> 06:38:18.478 align:start position:0%
and it seems obvious that 725 is just
 
06:38:20.910 --> 06:38:20.920 align:start position:0%
not enough I think everyone that works
 
06:38:23.230 --> 06:38:23.240 align:start position:0%
full-time deserves the Dignity of living
 
06:38:26.190 --> 06:38:26.200 align:start position:0%
wage so that they don't have to depend
 
06:38:29.948 --> 06:38:29.958 align:start position:0%
on any of the resources like Snap or um
 
06:38:33.350 --> 06:38:33.360 align:start position:0%
food assistance or any of the other even
 
06:38:35.990 --> 06:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
you know Medicaid assistance so I really
 
06:38:37.830 --> 06:38:37.840 align:start position:0%
hope that you will just pass this bill
 
06:38:40.750 --> 06:38:40.760 align:start position:0%
so that we can um afford everyone in New
 
06:38:43.510 --> 06:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the Dignity of a living wage
 
06:38:46.230 --> 06:38:46.240 align:start position:0%

moment you called my name the U the
 
06:39:34.468 --> 06:39:34.478 align:start position:0%

06:39:39.190 --> 06:39:39.200 align:start position:0%
so for the record my name is Gail Kenny
 
06:39:41.430 --> 06:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
I'm a resident of Kanan New Hampshire
 
06:39:43.590 --> 06:39:43.600 align:start position:0%
and I am a pastor with the United Church
 
06:39:46.830 --> 06:39:46.840 align:start position:0%
of Christ and back in um
 
06:39:49.388 --> 06:39:49.398 align:start position:0%
2014 uh the United Church of Christ
 
06:39:51.030 --> 06:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
which is the largest Protestant
 
06:39:54.110 --> 06:39:54.120 align:start position:0%
denomination in the state and and the UC
 
06:39:55.590 --> 06:39:55.600 align:start position:0%
is made up it it's all the
 
06:39:57.788 --> 06:39:57.798 align:start position:0%
congregational churches that dot the
 
06:39:59.788 --> 06:39:59.798 align:start position:0%
landscape from north to south east to
 
06:40:03.590 --> 06:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
west in New Hampshire um but the um in
 
06:40:07.468 --> 06:40:07.478 align:start position:0%
2014 this denomination passed a very
 
06:40:10.110 --> 06:40:10.120 align:start position:0%
strong resolution um calling on New
 
06:40:11.468 --> 06:40:11.478 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to
 
06:40:15.190 --> 06:40:15.200 align:start position:0%
reinstate a state minimum wage at a rate
 
06:40:17.868 --> 06:40:17.878 align:start position:0%
that was not a moral embarrassment and
 
06:40:20.510 --> 06:40:20.520 align:start position:0%
and other words um a living wage and
 
06:40:24.270 --> 06:40:24.280 align:start position:0%
that resolution sadly is now um 7 years
 
06:40:27.868 --> 06:40:27.878 align:start position:0%
old and um and every year the um the
 
06:40:29.788 --> 06:40:29.798 align:start position:0%
denomination along with his faith
 
06:40:31.230 --> 06:40:31.240 align:start position:0%
Partners in many many other
 
06:40:34.830 --> 06:40:34.840 align:start position:0%
denominations sort of restate and
 
06:40:37.590 --> 06:40:37.600 align:start position:0%
reinforce um their their commitment or
 
06:40:39.868 --> 06:40:39.878 align:start position:0%
their desire a matter of public policy
 
06:40:42.750 --> 06:40:42.760 align:start position:0%
for you folks to um to reestablish a
 
06:40:44.670 --> 06:40:44.680 align:start position:0%
minimum wage and make it a living wage
 
06:40:47.548 --> 06:40:47.558 align:start position:0%
so uh who does this uh really affect
 
06:40:50.468 --> 06:40:50.478 align:start position:0%
who's who's really um who are we dealing
 
06:40:51.990 --> 06:40:52.000 align:start position:0%
with who are we talking about what are
 
06:40:53.628 --> 06:40:53.638 align:start position:0%
the faces what are the names who are the
 
06:40:56.270 --> 06:40:56.280 align:start position:0%
people people and I would say that as we
 
06:40:58.628 --> 06:40:58.638 align:start position:0%
have lived through almost a year now of
 
06:41:00.990 --> 06:41:01.000 align:start position:0%
this pandemic I have to believe that
 
06:41:02.548 --> 06:41:02.558 align:start position:0%
every member of this committee at one
 
06:41:05.468 --> 06:41:05.478 align:start position:0%
point or another has praised essential
 
06:41:08.830 --> 06:41:08.840 align:start position:0%
workers those people who are are um
 
06:41:10.830 --> 06:41:10.840 align:start position:0%
still doing Food Service who were
 
06:41:13.230 --> 06:41:13.240 align:start position:0%
working as cashiers in the stores the
 
06:41:15.430 --> 06:41:15.440 align:start position:0%
people who were cleaning the uh the
 
06:41:18.430 --> 06:41:18.440 align:start position:0%
hospitals and nursing homes and even the
 
06:41:19.788 --> 06:41:19.798 align:start position:0%
the building that you were in those of
 
06:41:22.230 --> 06:41:22.240 align:start position:0%
you who are in the State House on people
 
06:41:24.030 --> 06:41:24.040 align:start position:0%
that are doing home health care or still
 
06:41:26.388 --> 06:41:26.398 align:start position:0%
taking care of children and on and on
 
06:41:30.388 --> 06:41:30.398 align:start position:0%
and most of the uh low-wage workers in
 
06:41:32.990 --> 06:41:33.000 align:start position:0%
our state at this point in time um who
 
06:41:35.310 --> 06:41:35.320 align:start position:0%
are still living in poverty um even
 
06:41:37.788 --> 06:41:37.798 align:start position:0%
though they're working full-time most of
 
06:41:40.310 --> 06:41:40.320 align:start position:0%
them are in fact the essential workers
 
06:41:41.990 --> 06:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
that we talk about and that we praise
 
06:41:44.830 --> 06:41:44.840 align:start position:0%
the unfortunate thing is that praise for
 
06:41:46.708 --> 06:41:46.718 align:start position:0%
those workers and lotting them and
 
06:41:48.468 --> 06:41:48.478 align:start position:0%
appreciate them for what they do does
 
06:41:51.548 --> 06:41:51.558 align:start position:0%
not pay their bills um so I want to uh
 
06:41:53.388 --> 06:41:53.398 align:start position:0%
just address two other things really
 
06:41:56.190 --> 06:41:56.200 align:start position:0%
quickly I want like to dispel a couple
 
06:41:58.990 --> 06:41:59.000 align:start position:0%
of myths that have been um raised over
 
06:42:02.270 --> 06:42:02.280 align:start position:0%
and over about um the um about a minimum
 
06:42:04.230 --> 06:42:04.240 align:start position:0%
wage or living wage and the first is
 
06:42:05.670 --> 06:42:05.680 align:start position:0%
that and this has been mentioned but I
 
06:42:08.430 --> 06:42:08.440 align:start position:0%
want to reiterate it um the original
 
06:42:11.110 --> 06:42:11.120 align:start position:0%
concept of a minimum wage for this
 
06:42:13.230 --> 06:42:13.240 align:start position:0%
nation and for the states over 70 years
 
06:42:16.948 --> 06:42:16.958 align:start position:0%
ago it was never ever ever meant to be a
 
06:42:19.910 --> 06:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
training wage it was meant to be a
 
06:42:23.708 --> 06:42:23.718 align:start position:0%
living wage it was meant to when um when
 
06:42:25.150 --> 06:42:25.160 align:start position:0%
Franklin Delano
 
06:42:28.708 --> 06:42:28.718 align:start position:0%
Roosevelt and others who um supported uh
 
06:42:30.548 --> 06:42:30.558 align:start position:0%
the concept of a minimum wage in both
 
06:42:32.388 --> 06:42:32.398 align:start position:0%
the house and the Senate and and across
 
06:42:34.628 --> 06:42:34.638 align:start position:0%
the country they were talking about a
 
06:42:37.150 --> 06:42:37.160 align:start position:0%
wage through which workers could afford
 
06:42:39.270 --> 06:42:39.280 align:start position:0%
full-time workers could afford the
 
06:42:41.270 --> 06:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
basics of living food clothing and
 
06:42:44.990 --> 06:42:45.000 align:start position:0%
shelter and and more and again I'm sure
 
06:42:46.388 --> 06:42:46.398 align:start position:0%
that every single member of this
 
06:42:49.070 --> 06:42:49.080 align:start position:0%
committee is very familiar with what the
 
06:42:52.510 --> 06:42:52.520 align:start position:0%
costs are uh for shelter and for food
 
06:42:53.990 --> 06:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
and the basics of living in New
 
06:42:55.350 --> 06:42:55.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and New Hampshire that also
 
06:42:57.948 --> 06:42:57.958 align:start position:0%
that includes transportation and heat
 
06:43:02.350 --> 06:43:02.360 align:start position:0%
Etc that you know what that costs and
 
06:43:05.830 --> 06:43:05.840 align:start position:0%
and the reality is the reality is that
 
06:43:08.150 --> 06:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
every single person who works full-time
 
06:43:10.190 --> 06:43:10.200 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire should be
 
06:43:12.628 --> 06:43:12.638 align:start position:0%
able to for those things the basics of
 
06:43:16.070 --> 06:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
living in the state of New Hampshire um
 
06:43:18.150 --> 06:43:18.160 align:start position:0%
and and that that should be a moral
 
06:43:19.830 --> 06:43:19.840 align:start position:0%
priority I would hope for every member
 
06:43:23.990 --> 06:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
of the legislature and second um it's
 
06:43:26.628 --> 06:43:26.638 align:start position:0%
it's argued that um and I think we heard
 
06:43:29.030 --> 06:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
this today already um in terms of I
 
06:43:32.910 --> 06:43:32.920 align:start position:0%
think it was House Bill 107 that um well
 
06:43:34.990 --> 06:43:35.000 align:start position:0%
you know we don't need to establish a
 
06:43:36.750 --> 06:43:36.760 align:start position:0%
state minimum wage we don't need to have
 
06:43:38.708 --> 06:43:38.718 align:start position:0%
a public policy for a wage flow or
 
06:43:41.190 --> 06:43:41.200 align:start position:0%
public policies for living wages because
 
06:43:44.468 --> 06:43:44.478 align:start position:0%
the market will provide the market will
 
06:43:46.468 --> 06:43:46.478 align:start position:0%
take care of things just let the mark
 
06:43:48.990 --> 06:43:49.000 align:start position:0%
the free market provide well okay so the
 
06:43:52.628 --> 06:43:52.638 align:start position:0%
market provides except when it doesn't
 
06:43:55.990 --> 06:43:56.000 align:start position:0%
if the market were working then every
 
06:43:58.548 --> 06:43:58.558 align:start position:0%
person um who was working a full-time
 
06:44:01.190 --> 06:44:01.200 align:start position:0%
job would be able to lift themselves out
 
06:44:03.270 --> 06:44:03.280 align:start position:0%
of poverty and that is frankly not the
 
06:44:05.230 --> 06:44:05.240 align:start position:0%
case in New Hampshire if the market
 
06:44:07.708 --> 06:44:07.718 align:start position:0%
would uh were to provide then full-time
 
06:44:09.990 --> 06:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
workers would not have to depend on
 
06:44:10.000 --> 06:44:11.270 align:start position:0%
workers would not have to depend on
tax-funded

06:44:11.270 --> 06:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
tax-funded
 
06:44:14.230 --> 06:44:14.240 align:start position:0%
Services for food for heat for Health
 
06:44:18.350 --> 06:44:18.360 align:start position:0%
Care Etc um if if the market were
 
06:44:20.788 --> 06:44:20.798 align:start position:0%
working um particularly for people in
 
06:44:22.788 --> 06:44:22.798 align:start position:0%
food service and hospitality and health
 
06:44:24.948 --> 06:44:24.958 align:start position:0%
care and Elder Care care and janitorial
 
06:44:28.150 --> 06:44:28.160 align:start position:0%
services they wouldn't continue to live
 
06:44:30.830 --> 06:44:30.840 align:start position:0%
in poverty they wouldn't live a life of
 
06:44:34.350 --> 06:44:34.360 align:start position:0%
of um of economic anxiety every day of
 
06:44:36.510 --> 06:44:36.520 align:start position:0%
their lives um so another thing I just
 
06:44:38.310 --> 06:44:38.320 align:start position:0%
want to note about this particular bill
 
06:44:41.070 --> 06:44:41.080 align:start position:0%
I was fascinated by the fiscal note the
 
06:44:43.350 --> 06:44:43.360 align:start position:0%
fiscal note talks about uh or it
 
06:44:47.070 --> 06:44:47.080 align:start position:0%
outlines um in terms of the state that
 
06:44:49.468 --> 06:44:49.478 align:start position:0%
oh my goodness if we were to raise the
 
06:44:52.708 --> 06:44:52.718 align:start position:0%
minimum wage even up to that $12 Mark or
 
06:44:55.350 --> 06:44:55.360 align:start position:0%
whatever just that would affect the
 
06:44:59.468 --> 06:44:59.478 align:start position:0%
state because we already we pay 241
 
06:45:02.388 --> 06:45:02.398 align:start position:0%
people right now below that Mark and um
 
06:45:04.388 --> 06:45:04.398 align:start position:0%
and in the next tier of the raise that
 
06:45:07.110 --> 06:45:07.120 align:start position:0%
would affect seven 901 workers and on
 
06:45:09.750 --> 06:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
and on so my question is who are those
 
06:45:13.070 --> 06:45:13.080 align:start position:0%
241 workers today that are working not
 
06:45:14.788 --> 06:45:14.798 align:start position:0%
enough really to survive and are they
 
06:45:16.910 --> 06:45:16.920 align:start position:0%
also on food stamps or any other kind of
 
06:45:19.548 --> 06:45:19.558 align:start position:0%
support and it should be are they
 
06:45:21.388 --> 06:45:21.398 align:start position:0%
essential workers what kind of service
 
06:45:24.350 --> 06:45:24.360 align:start position:0%
are they providing state workers are are
 
06:45:26.628 --> 06:45:26.638 align:start position:0%
sort of an essential foundation for
 
06:45:28.750 --> 06:45:28.760 align:start position:0%
beloved we talk in in the church we use
 
06:45:31.590 --> 06:45:31.600 align:start position:0%
the word Beloved Community but if we are
 
06:45:34.110 --> 06:45:34.120 align:start position:0%
not paying workers today state workers
 
06:45:37.070 --> 06:45:37.080 align:start position:0%
today enough to live on that that fiscal
 
06:45:39.310 --> 06:45:39.320 align:start position:0%
note should be an embarrassment to all
 
06:45:41.830 --> 06:45:41.840 align:start position:0%
of us so I just wanted to um to to
 
06:45:43.910 --> 06:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
emphasize that point as well um I just
 
06:45:45.830 --> 06:45:45.840 align:start position:0%
want to say something quickly about in
 
06:45:48.110 --> 06:45:48.120 align:start position:0%
reference back to house bill 501 and to
 
06:45:50.150 --> 06:45:50.160 align:start position:0%
just minimum the concept of minimum wage
 
06:45:52.788 --> 06:45:52.798 align:start position:0%
overall there is a a a history professor
 
06:45:55.230 --> 06:45:55.240 align:start position:0%
at Dartmouth who is nationally known
 
06:45:56.750 --> 06:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
actually internationally known for her
 
06:45:59.830 --> 06:45:59.840 align:start position:0%
work on on wages Analise Dr Analise
 
06:46:02.070 --> 06:46:02.080 align:start position:0%
orleck and she wrote a book two years
 
06:46:06.030 --> 06:46:06.040 align:start position:0%
ago we are all fast food workers now and
 
06:46:07.708 --> 06:46:07.718 align:start position:0%
the title of that book comes from when
 
06:46:10.788 --> 06:46:10.798 align:start position:0%
she was interviewing adjunct faculty who
 
06:46:13.310 --> 06:46:13.320 align:start position:0%
said you know what we we're we're fast
 
06:46:15.430 --> 06:46:15.440 align:start position:0%
food workers now that's what we make or
 
06:46:16.990 --> 06:46:17.000 align:start position:0%
even less than what fast food workers
 
06:46:20.270 --> 06:46:20.280 align:start position:0%
make and in her research she has found
 
06:46:23.150 --> 06:46:23.160 align:start position:0%
that um adjunct faculty members were
 
06:46:26.510 --> 06:46:26.520 align:start position:0%
among among the most easily economically
 
06:46:30.310 --> 06:46:30.320 align:start position:0%
exploited and some of the lowest paid uh
 
06:46:32.590 --> 06:46:32.600 align:start position:0%
people in the workforce on an hourly
 
06:46:34.750 --> 06:46:34.760 align:start position:0%
basis so that's just I that's a moral
 
06:46:36.948 --> 06:46:36.958 align:start position:0%
embarrassment too so overall I know
 
06:46:38.150 --> 06:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
you'll hear from other people and you've
 
06:46:39.628 --> 06:46:39.638 align:start position:0%
already heard excellent testimony with
 
06:46:42.750 --> 06:46:42.760 align:start position:0%
facts and figures but essential
 
06:46:45.150 --> 06:46:45.160 align:start position:0%
workers deserve in the state of New
 
06:46:48.310 --> 06:46:48.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire deserve to essentially live
 
06:46:51.990 --> 06:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
and that should be a basic public policy
 
06:46:54.270 --> 06:46:54.280 align:start position:0%
of the State of New Hampshire so I urge
 
06:46:57.350 --> 06:46:57.360 align:start position:0%
you I implore you um with all the the
 
06:47:00.350 --> 06:47:00.360 align:start position:0%
moral strength I can muster um to find
 
06:47:02.270 --> 06:47:02.280 align:start position:0%
this bill ought to
 
06:47:04.990 --> 06:47:05.000 align:start position:0%
pass thank
 
06:47:09.070 --> 06:47:09.080 align:start position:0%
youon um are there any questions for
 
06:47:11.990 --> 06:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:14.830 --> 06:47:14.840 align:start position:0%
online seeing no hands are there any
 
06:47:16.948 --> 06:47:16.958 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
06:47:19.670 --> 06:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
room seeing none thank you again for
 
06:47:19.680 --> 06:47:20.910 align:start position:0%
room seeing none thank you again for
your

06:47:20.910 --> 06:47:20.920 align:start position:0%
your
 
06:47:25.110 --> 06:47:25.120 align:start position:0%
time um do we have any any other uh
 
06:47:26.468 --> 06:47:26.478 align:start position:0%
people waiting
 
06:47:35.350 --> 06:47:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:38.468 --> 06:47:38.478 align:start position:0%
eluni missel honei you recognized to
 
06:47:41.910 --> 06:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
speak thank you chair can you hear me
 
06:47:45.350 --> 06:47:45.360 align:start position:0%
yes awesome my name is Asma alonei and
 
06:47:47.270 --> 06:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
I'm the movement politics director for
 
06:47:50.230 --> 06:47:50.240 align:start position:0%
rights and democracy New Hampshire uh I
 
06:47:52.070 --> 06:47:52.080 align:start position:0%
actually wanted to speak in favor of
 
06:47:54.788 --> 06:47:54.798 align:start position:0%
House Bill 107 for a livable wage
 
06:47:56.388 --> 06:47:56.398 align:start position:0%
because that's what we really need to
 
06:47:58.788 --> 06:47:58.798 align:start position:0%
support livable wages but since we did
 
06:48:02.350 --> 06:48:02.360 align:start position:0%
move on um I am here to speak in support
 
06:48:05.628 --> 06:48:05.638 align:start position:0%
of HB 517 because it's the next best
 
06:48:08.310 --> 06:48:08.320 align:start position:0%
thing and certainly not enough um also I
 
06:48:10.150 --> 06:48:10.160 align:start position:0%
just want to also address representative
 
06:48:12.670 --> 06:48:12.680 align:start position:0%
Greg Hugh um uh representative I
 
06:48:14.788 --> 06:48:14.798 align:start position:0%
actually live in Lebanon I moved to
 
06:48:18.030 --> 06:48:18.040 align:start position:0%
Lebanon in August and I would not have
 
06:48:20.750 --> 06:48:20.760 align:start position:0%
moved to Lebanon without three
 
06:48:23.670 --> 06:48:23.680 align:start position:0%
individuals who are paying rent in uh
 
06:48:26.110 --> 06:48:26.120 align:start position:0%
our our apartment so just wanted to say
 
06:48:27.510 --> 06:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
that our rent is $1
 
06:48:29.948 --> 06:48:29.958 align:start position:0%
19994 I also have friends who are
 
06:48:32.830 --> 06:48:32.840 align:start position:0%
sharing homes in Lebanon as well so not
 
06:48:34.388 --> 06:48:34.398 align:start position:0%
really sure why you asked if there were
 
06:48:36.628 --> 06:48:36.638 align:start position:0%
people living in Lebanon because uh yes
 
06:48:38.150 --> 06:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
there are people living in Lebanon and
 
06:48:40.150 --> 06:48:40.160 align:start position:0%
yes there are people struggling to keep
 
06:48:42.270 --> 06:48:42.280 align:start position:0%
a roof over their heads who live there
 
06:48:44.708 --> 06:48:44.718 align:start position:0%
as well so just wanted to share that so
 
06:48:46.628 --> 06:48:46.638 align:start position:0%
back to the bill um this is certainly
 
06:48:48.990 --> 06:48:49.000 align:start position:0%
not a complicated bill um and I'm
 
06:48:50.708 --> 06:48:50.718 align:start position:0%
certain that none of you here are going
 
06:48:54.750 --> 06:48:54.760 align:start position:0%
to be okay with the current 725 24 the
 
06:48:57.670 --> 06:48:57.680 align:start position:0%
uh current minimum wage uh and so I
 
06:48:59.948 --> 06:48:59.958 align:start position:0%
expect that all of you will uh do the
 
06:49:02.230 --> 06:49:02.240 align:start position:0%
proper thing and and definitely vote in
 
06:49:03.990 --> 06:49:04.000 align:start position:0%
support of this bill uh this is
 
06:49:05.990 --> 06:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
definitely a no-brainer and I trust
 
06:49:08.150 --> 06:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
again that you'll vote the right way but
 
06:49:10.430 --> 06:49:10.440 align:start position:0%
I do wanted to share a testimony from a
 
06:49:12.510 --> 06:49:12.520 align:start position:0%
restaurant because we were talking about
 
06:49:15.030 --> 06:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
small business um and the restaurant is
 
06:49:18.388 --> 06:49:18.398 align:start position:0%
called ganos and it's also in Lebanon
 
06:49:20.350 --> 06:49:20.360 align:start position:0%
and this is what they gave us to share
 
06:49:22.510 --> 06:49:22.520 align:start position:0%
uh with this legislative body um and
 
06:49:24.788 --> 06:49:24.798 align:start position:0%
they gave me this last session uh this
 
06:49:27.388 --> 06:49:27.398 align:start position:0%
is a response towards the argument that
 
06:49:29.708 --> 06:49:29.718 align:start position:0%
this will hurt small businesses and
 
06:49:33.110 --> 06:49:33.120 align:start position:0%
basically they said um quote Dear Sir
 
06:49:35.270 --> 06:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
Madame I am writing to express our
 
06:49:37.230 --> 06:49:37.240 align:start position:0%
support for the concept of raising the
 
06:49:40.190 --> 06:49:40.200 align:start position:0%
minimum wage to a livable wage our own
 
06:49:41.868 --> 06:49:41.878 align:start position:0%
minimum wage in our kitchen is
 
06:49:44.310 --> 06:49:44.320 align:start position:0%
effectively $13 per hour with the
 
06:49:46.350 --> 06:49:46.360 align:start position:0%
average wage of an experienced cook
 
06:49:50.830 --> 06:49:50.840 align:start position:0%
between 15 and $16 per hour we currently
 
06:49:53.430 --> 06:49:53.440 align:start position:0%
pay non-tipped employees such as host as
 
06:49:56.388 --> 06:49:56.398 align:start position:0%
little as $111 per hour but it would not
 
06:49:58.990 --> 06:49:59.000 align:start position:0%
be crippling if we were increased to
 
06:50:01.750 --> 06:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
$13 our tipped employees average a
 
06:50:04.350 --> 06:50:04.360 align:start position:0%
combined wage of hourly wages and tips
 
06:50:07.350 --> 06:50:07.360 align:start position:0%
of at least $13 per hour for busers in
 
06:50:09.430 --> 06:50:09.440 align:start position:0%
similar positions and our servers
 
06:50:12.948 --> 06:50:12.958 align:start position:0%
average $15 per hour or more with some
 
06:50:15.670 --> 06:50:15.680 align:start position:0%
earning significantly more keeping the
 
06:50:18.310 --> 06:50:18.320 align:start position:0%
tipped employee wage at 327 with the
 
06:50:20.468 --> 06:50:20.478 align:start position:0%
exception that their combined wage to
 
06:50:23.670 --> 06:50:23.680 align:start position:0%
include tips would equal $13 per hour
 
06:50:27.430 --> 06:50:27.440 align:start position:0%
would not impact Us in any way Maria and
 
06:50:29.270 --> 06:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
I believe that the work that is done by
 
06:50:31.468 --> 06:50:31.478 align:start position:0%
our employees is worthy of a livable
 
06:50:33.350 --> 06:50:33.360 align:start position:0%
wage and while we understand that
 
06:50:36.070 --> 06:50:36.080 align:start position:0%
increasing the minimum wage um we may
 
06:50:38.430 --> 06:50:38.440 align:start position:0%
have to increase our overall wages over
 
06:50:41.350 --> 06:50:41.360 align:start position:0%
time we do also believe that an overall
 
06:50:43.590 --> 06:50:43.600 align:start position:0%
wages increase in our state there will
 
06:50:45.628 --> 06:50:45.638 align:start position:0%
be more money being pumped into the
 
06:50:48.548 --> 06:50:48.558 align:start position:0%
local economy we also believe that when
 
06:50:50.468 --> 06:50:50.478 align:start position:0%
people when possible it is better to
 
06:50:52.750 --> 06:50:52.760 align:start position:0%
offer a livable wage and to encourage
 
06:50:55.190 --> 06:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
the Dignity of rewarding work than to
 
06:50:57.310 --> 06:50:57.320 align:start position:0%
otherwise supplement family incomes
 
06:51:00.030 --> 06:51:00.040 align:start position:0%
through government programs by ensuring
 
06:51:01.910 --> 06:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
Fair wages we would hope to see a
 
06:51:04.910 --> 06:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
decrease in these programs over time or
 
06:51:06.230 --> 06:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
at least the amount of time that
 
06:51:08.110 --> 06:51:08.120 align:start position:0%
individuals and families spend
 
06:51:11.628 --> 06:51:11.638 align:start position:0%
benefiting from programs before becoming
 
06:51:13.948 --> 06:51:13.958 align:start position:0%
self-supporting and so um yeah I just
 
06:51:16.270 --> 06:51:16.280 align:start position:0%
wanted to share this uh testimony with
 
06:51:18.868 --> 06:51:18.878 align:start position:0%
you and and just to to share that small
 
06:51:22.150 --> 06:51:22.160 align:start position:0%
businesses um that uh that understand
 
06:51:24.590 --> 06:51:24.600 align:start position:0%
that when we pay pay workers livable
 
06:51:27.230 --> 06:51:27.240 align:start position:0%
wages it's going to benefit all of us
 
06:51:29.350 --> 06:51:29.360 align:start position:0%
and and the fact that we're relying on
 
06:51:31.350 --> 06:51:31.360 align:start position:0%
restaurants to do that the free market
 
06:51:33.110 --> 06:51:33.120 align:start position:0%
as they would call it is very
 
06:51:35.270 --> 06:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
problematic because then some um
 
06:51:37.510 --> 06:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
employers will pay their employees
 
06:51:39.388 --> 06:51:39.398 align:start position:0%
livable wages While others don't and
 
06:51:41.830 --> 06:51:41.840 align:start position:0%
that won't benefit the economy the way
 
06:51:43.310 --> 06:51:43.320 align:start position:0%
um we were talking about pumping money
 
06:51:45.510 --> 06:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
into the economy that that'll only work
 
06:51:47.948 --> 06:51:47.958 align:start position:0%
if everyone is paying their employees a
 
06:51:49.990 --> 06:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
livable wage and that way we have
 
06:51:53.270 --> 06:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
everyone getting money and able to um uh
 
06:51:55.388 --> 06:51:55.398 align:start position:0%
uh spend because obviously research has
 
06:51:57.910 --> 06:51:57.920 align:start position:0%
shown that people that make more spend
 
06:52:00.030 --> 06:52:00.040 align:start position:0%
more and of course I'm talking about the
 
06:52:03.270 --> 06:52:03.280 align:start position:0%
average um uh resident or a Community
 
06:52:04.310 --> 06:52:04.320 align:start position:0%
member I'm not talking about
 
06:52:05.910 --> 06:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
Millionaires and and billionaires but
 
06:52:09.190 --> 06:52:09.200 align:start position:0%
the average um uh Community member does
 
06:52:10.708 --> 06:52:10.718 align:start position:0%
spend when they make
 
06:52:13.948 --> 06:52:13.958 align:start position:0%
more thank you thank you for your
 
06:52:16.750 --> 06:52:16.760 align:start position:0%

giving me the opportunity to address the
 
06:53:20.948 --> 06:53:20.958 align:start position:0%
committee regarding the minimum wage
 
06:53:23.548 --> 06:53:23.558 align:start position:0%
bills um my name is Kathy Al and I live
 
06:53:23.558 --> 06:53:24.310 align:start position:0%
bills um my name is Kathy Al and I live
in

06:53:24.310 --> 06:53:24.320 align:start position:0%
in
 
06:53:27.670 --> 06:53:27.680 align:start position:0%
Manchester um and this is a really very
 
06:53:29.548 --> 06:53:29.558 align:start position:0%
important issue we have a lot of people
 
06:53:32.310 --> 06:53:32.320 align:start position:0%
in Manchester who work for low wages and
 
06:53:34.030 --> 06:53:34.040 align:start position:0%
um they really are counting on you to
 
06:53:36.628 --> 06:53:36.638 align:start position:0%
help them live better lives the last
 
06:53:38.948 --> 06:53:38.958 align:start position:0%
time the minimum wage was raised in New
 
06:53:41.388 --> 06:53:41.398 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was in September of
 
06:53:43.910 --> 06:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
2008 um every other New England state
 
06:53:45.430 --> 06:53:45.440 align:start position:0%
has raised the minimum wage for its
 
06:53:48.670 --> 06:53:48.680 align:start position:0%
workers mostly by legislation um and in
 
06:53:51.350 --> 06:53:51.360 align:start position:0%
Maine it was a ballot initiative I sent
 
06:53:53.628 --> 06:53:53.638 align:start position:0%
my testimony VI email because there's a
 
06:53:55.788 --> 06:53:55.798 align:start position:0%
lot of numbers and I wanted to make sure
 
06:53:58.910 --> 06:53:58.920 align:start position:0%
that uh you had something to refer to um
 
06:54:00.750 --> 06:54:00.760 align:start position:0%
looking back at
 
06:54:03.510 --> 06:54:03.520 align:start position:0%
20110 um the minimum wage in the New
 
06:54:06.070 --> 06:54:06.080 align:start position:0%
England states raised from ranged from a
 
06:54:09.830 --> 06:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
low of 725 in New Hampshire to a high of
 
06:54:13.388 --> 06:54:13.398 align:start position:0%
$825 in Connecticut so there was a range
 
06:54:14.788 --> 06:54:14.798 align:start position:0%
there but they were all pretty much in
 
06:54:17.830 --> 06:54:17.840 align:start position:0%
the same ballpark um today Massachusetts
 
06:54:20.230 --> 06:54:20.240 align:start position:0%
has the highest minimum wage at
 
06:54:23.190 --> 06:54:23.200 align:start position:0%
$13.50 and the lowest minimum wage in
 
06:54:26.110 --> 06:54:26.120 align:start position:0%
New England outside of New Hampshire is
 
06:54:29.110 --> 06:54:29.120 align:start position:0%
$11.50 and we remain at
 
06:54:34.868 --> 06:54:34.878 align:start position:0%
$725 an hour um that's just that that is
 
06:54:37.030 --> 06:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
really having a negative impact on
 
06:54:39.750 --> 06:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
working people in our economy um you
 
06:54:41.788 --> 06:54:41.798 align:start position:0%
know I've heard a lot of excuses for not
 
06:54:44.030 --> 06:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
raising the minimum wage and I'd like to
 
06:54:46.628 --> 06:54:46.638 align:start position:0%
address a couple of them um the first
 
06:54:49.670 --> 06:54:49.680 align:start position:0%
one is that no one actually makes 725 an
 
06:54:53.628 --> 06:54:53.638 align:start position:0%
hour um you know minimum wage is not um
 
06:54:55.708 --> 06:54:55.718 align:start position:0%
it's not an absolute thing it's it's
 
06:54:57.948 --> 06:54:57.958 align:start position:0%
kind of like it's not a microeconomic
 
06:55:00.190 --> 06:55:00.200 align:start position:0%
thing it's a macroeconomic thing and
 
06:55:02.150 --> 06:55:02.160 align:start position:0%
raising the minimum wage is like kind of
 
06:55:04.990 --> 06:55:05.000 align:start position:0%
like releasing a valve so you open it up
 
06:55:07.388 --> 06:55:07.398 align:start position:0%
a little bit um you raise the minimum
 
06:55:09.468 --> 06:55:09.478 align:start position:0%
wage and a bunch of money floods into
 
06:55:11.548 --> 06:55:11.558 align:start position:0%
the economy and that circulates around
 
06:55:13.868 --> 06:55:13.878 align:start position:0%
and that provides stimulation and that
 
06:55:15.750 --> 06:55:15.760 align:start position:0%
enables you to keep raising the minimum
 
06:55:18.548 --> 06:55:18.558 align:start position:0%
wage um and it's true that there are
 
06:55:21.190 --> 06:55:21.200 align:start position:0%
very few people in Manchester making 725
 
06:55:23.670 --> 06:55:23.680 align:start position:0%
an hour but because we have such a low
 
06:55:26.548 --> 06:55:26.558 align:start position:0%
floor it has hampered wage growth for
 
06:55:28.350 --> 06:55:28.360 align:start position:0%
other New Hampshire workers around the
 
06:55:31.388 --> 06:55:31.398 align:start position:0%
state um for example we have
 
06:55:34.388 --> 06:55:34.398 align:start position:0%
58,300 this these statistics are from
 
06:55:36.830 --> 06:55:36.840 align:start position:0%
the um um new New Hampshire Department
 
06:55:38.670 --> 06:55:38.680 align:start position:0%
of Employment Security
 
06:55:41.990 --> 06:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
elmi um document um we have and it says
 
06:55:44.868 --> 06:55:44.878 align:start position:0%
that we have 58,000 food service workers
 
06:55:47.510 --> 06:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
and their average starting wage is $910
 
06:55:51.670 --> 06:55:51.680 align:start position:0%
an hour the median wage is $123 an hour
 
06:55:53.830 --> 06:55:53.840 align:start position:0%
which means that half of those 58,000
 
06:55:56.708 --> 06:55:56.718 align:start position:0%
people are making less than $12 an hour
 
06:55:58.388 --> 06:55:58.398 align:start position:0%
which is significantly less than a lot
 
06:56:01.990 --> 06:56:02.000 align:start position:0%
of the minimum wages in um other states
 
06:56:03.468 --> 06:56:03.478 align:start position:0%
um we have
 
06:56:07.110 --> 06:56:07.120 align:start position:0%
21,500 Cashers in the state um in their
 
06:56:10.670 --> 06:56:10.680 align:start position:0%
um average starting wage is $99.90 an
 
06:56:12.868 --> 06:56:12.878 align:start position:0%
hour the median wage is
 
06:56:15.990 --> 06:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
1153 um those are essential workers if
 
06:56:17.350 --> 06:56:17.360 align:start position:0%
those people didn't come to work we
 
06:56:19.750 --> 06:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
would have all starved to death by now
 
06:56:22.070 --> 06:56:22.080 align:start position:0%
um we also have home alads who are
 
06:56:24.948 --> 06:56:24.958 align:start position:0%
starting at 1123 and childcare workers
 
06:56:28.388 --> 06:56:28.398 align:start position:0%
starting at 952 and janitors at
 
06:56:30.868 --> 06:56:30.878 align:start position:0%
$11.13 an hour and we have those are
 
06:56:32.510 --> 06:56:32.520 align:start position:0%
essential workers those are the people
 
06:56:35.230 --> 06:56:35.240 align:start position:0%
who have been keeping things going for
 
06:56:38.150 --> 06:56:38.160 align:start position:0%
us and they are making very low wages um
 
06:56:40.150 --> 06:56:40.160 align:start position:0%
and they should be able to live with
 
06:56:43.788 --> 06:56:43.798 align:start position:0%
dignity um the economic policy Institute
 
06:56:46.910 --> 06:56:46.920 align:start position:0%
estimates that there are 153,000 New
 
06:56:48.590 --> 06:56:48.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire workers who would benefit from
 
06:56:52.708 --> 06:56:52.718 align:start position:0%
raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour
 
06:56:54.788 --> 06:56:54.798 align:start position:0%
the other argument that I hear is that
 
06:56:58.030 --> 06:56:58.040 align:start position:0%
it'll cause prices to go up well um
 
06:57:00.670 --> 06:57:00.680 align:start position:0%
prices have been going up uh since
 
06:57:03.910 --> 06:57:03.920 align:start position:0%
2008 um housing costs for example have
 
06:57:05.708 --> 06:57:05.718 align:start position:0%
increased I'm using New Hampshire
 
06:57:07.910 --> 06:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
lowincome housing uh Coalition
 
06:57:09.388 --> 06:57:09.398 align:start position:0%
statistics which are a little bit
 
06:57:11.750 --> 06:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
different than the um numbers that uh
 
06:57:15.070 --> 06:57:15.080 align:start position:0%
representative Frost had but um you know
 
06:57:17.948 --> 06:57:17.958 align:start position:0%
in 2008 a two-bedroom apartment in New
 
06:57:19.590 --> 06:57:19.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was
 
06:57:22.948 --> 06:57:22.958 align:start position:0%
$1,044 per month and in 200 20 they
 
06:57:25.708 --> 06:57:25.718 align:start position:0%
listed as um
 
06:57:28.270 --> 06:57:28.280 align:start position:0%
$1,218 and it's higher in a lot of other
 
06:57:30.750 --> 06:57:30.760 align:start position:0%
places for example Lebanon or Rockingham
 
06:57:34.468 --> 06:57:34.478 align:start position:0%
County they have very high rents um so
 
06:57:36.910 --> 06:57:36.920 align:start position:0%
um you know so prices are going up and I
 
06:57:38.468 --> 06:57:38.478 align:start position:0%
think anybody who's been to the grocery
 
06:57:41.190 --> 06:57:41.200 align:start position:0%
store recently also knows that um
 
06:57:43.030 --> 06:57:43.040 align:start position:0%
because you know food prices have also
 
06:57:47.510 --> 06:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
gone up ex a lot during this um pandemic
 
06:57:50.270 --> 06:57:50.280 align:start position:0%
um the other argument is that um if you
 
06:57:51.548 --> 06:57:51.558 align:start position:0%
raise the minimum wage it's going to
 
06:57:54.990 --> 06:57:55.000 align:start position:0%
crash the economy H hamper recovery um
 
06:57:56.510 --> 06:57:56.520 align:start position:0%
you only have to look at our neighboring
 
06:57:58.430 --> 06:57:58.440 align:start position:0%
states to see that that's not the case
 
06:58:01.350 --> 06:58:01.360 align:start position:0%
in 2017 Maine raised their minimum wage
 
06:58:03.708 --> 06:58:03.718 align:start position:0%
from $7.50 to
 
06:58:06.548 --> 06:58:06.558 align:start position:0%
$9 um income for the lowest paid workers
 
06:58:09.190 --> 06:58:09.200 align:start position:0%
increased by the greatest amount since
 
06:58:11.948 --> 06:58:11.958 align:start position:0%
2001 um an estimated 10,000 children
 
06:58:14.510 --> 06:58:14.520 align:start position:0%
were lifted out of poverty and in March
 
06:58:17.388 --> 06:58:17.398 align:start position:0%
of 2018 the unemployment reached its
 
06:58:19.948 --> 06:58:19.958 align:start position:0%
lowest rate in 40 years they raised
 
06:58:23.868 --> 06:58:23.878 align:start position:0%
their minimum wage to $10 in 2018 $11 in
 
06:58:27.708 --> 06:58:27.718 align:start position:0%
2019 and $12 in 2020 and employment
 
06:58:32.350 --> 06:58:32.360 align:start position:0%
rates um remain below um 4% until the
 
06:58:35.430 --> 06:58:35.440 align:start position:0%
pandemic and I don't know how the
 
06:58:38.548 --> 06:58:38.558 align:start position:0%
recovery will go um I suspect that
 
06:58:40.230 --> 06:58:40.240 align:start position:0%
having tens of thousands of underpaid
 
06:58:41.910 --> 06:58:41.920 align:start position:0%
workers who are unable to save for an
 
06:58:43.750 --> 06:58:43.760 align:start position:0%
emergency is going to make it really
 
06:58:46.110 --> 06:58:46.120 align:start position:0%
difficult for families to recover to pay
 
06:58:48.350 --> 06:58:48.360 align:start position:0%
back rent the credit card debt that
 
06:58:50.628 --> 06:58:50.638 align:start position:0%
they've incurred um since they've been
 
06:58:52.868 --> 06:58:52.878 align:start position:0%
out of work um what I do know is that
 
06:58:54.430 --> 06:58:54.440 align:start position:0%
raising the minimum wage has been an
 
06:58:56.468 --> 06:58:56.478 align:start position:0%
important economic stimulus tool since
 
06:58:58.830 --> 06:58:58.840 align:start position:0%
the Great Depression um the last time
 
06:58:59.990 --> 06:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
the federal government raised the
 
06:59:01.590 --> 06:59:01.600 align:start position:0%
minimum wage was during a Great
 
06:59:03.590 --> 06:59:03.600 align:start position:0%
Recession it helps the lowest paid
 
06:59:05.628 --> 06:59:05.638 align:start position:0%
workers meet their needs and infuses
 
06:59:07.230 --> 06:59:07.240 align:start position:0%
cash into the economy and it gets it
 
06:59:09.548 --> 06:59:09.558 align:start position:0%
circulating through big bit um through
 
06:59:12.670 --> 06:59:12.680 align:start position:0%
business businesses big and small um
 
06:59:14.910 --> 06:59:14.920 align:start position:0%
another argument that I hear is that um
 
06:59:16.910 --> 06:59:16.920 align:start position:0%
other states have income taxes and
 
06:59:18.230 --> 06:59:18.240 align:start position:0%
that's why they have to have higher
 
06:59:20.070 --> 06:59:20.080 align:start position:0%
wages and it's true that New Hampshire
 
06:59:22.270 --> 06:59:22.280 align:start position:0%
does not have an income tax but our
 
06:59:25.310 --> 06:59:25.320 align:start position:0%
wages are so low much lower than minimum
 
06:59:28.868 --> 06:59:28.878 align:start position:0%
wage in earners in other states um that
 
06:59:31.788 --> 06:59:31.798 align:start position:0%
um you know it really does it really
 
06:59:34.510 --> 06:59:34.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter um Maine has a 5.8%
 
06:59:38.270 --> 06:59:38.280 align:start position:0%
income tax up to $44,000 a year and net
 
06:59:41.070 --> 06:59:41.080 align:start position:0%
income after state tax is applied will
 
06:59:42.070 --> 06:59:42.080 align:start position:0%
still be
 
06:59:45.430 --> 06:59:45.440 align:start position:0%
$145 an hour Massachusetts has a flat
 
06:59:48.750 --> 06:59:48.760 align:start position:0%
tax of 5% and the net income after taxes
 
06:59:50.590 --> 06:59:50.600 align:start position:0%
applied is still
 
06:59:53.270 --> 06:59:53.280 align:start position:0%
$12.83 which is a lot more than than
 
06:59:55.388 --> 06:59:55.398 align:start position:0%
than our low-wage workers are making in
 
06:59:57.150 --> 06:59:57.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I mean I could do the
 
06:59:58.628 --> 06:59:58.638 align:start position:0%
other states but I think you know you
 
07:00:02.230 --> 07:00:02.240 align:start position:0%
get the idea um I'd also like to um take
 
07:00:05.230 --> 07:00:05.240 align:start position:0%
a minute to talk about tipped wages um
 
07:00:07.270 --> 07:00:07.280 align:start position:0%
you know um I've often heard people talk
 
07:00:10.270 --> 07:00:10.280 align:start position:0%
about oh um how much money their servers
 
07:00:13.190 --> 07:00:13.200 align:start position:0%
make by serving up the $13 hamburgers
 
07:00:16.270 --> 07:00:16.280 align:start position:0%
and indeed um I'm curious to know where
 
07:00:20.708 --> 07:00:20.718 align:start position:0%
that $18 an hour um figure um came from
 
07:00:23.628 --> 07:00:23.638 align:start position:0%
because when I look at the LMI report it
 
07:00:25.708 --> 07:00:25.718 align:start position:0%
says that for waiters and waitresses the
 
07:00:28.030 --> 07:00:28.040 align:start position:0%
average wage starting wage is
 
07:00:32.548 --> 07:00:32.558 align:start position:0%
$8.7 an hour the u mean wage is $13.30
 
07:00:35.430 --> 07:00:35.440 align:start position:0%
an hour and the median is $9.97 so I
 
07:00:36.910 --> 07:00:36.920 align:start position:0%
would be curious to know where those
 
07:00:39.350 --> 07:00:39.360 align:start position:0%
numbers are coming from but when I go
 
07:00:42.230 --> 07:00:42.240 align:start position:0%
out to a restaurant that $13 hamburger
 
07:00:45.830 --> 07:00:45.840 align:start position:0%
does not cost me $13 I tip it 20% so
 
07:00:47.750 --> 07:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
that means that I pay
 
07:00:50.190 --> 07:00:50.200 align:start position:0%
$15.60 and then you add the 9% room in
 
07:00:51.788 --> 07:00:51.798 align:start position:0%
meals tax and the total cost of the
 
07:00:54.350 --> 07:00:54.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:56.830 --> 07:00:56.840 align:start position:0%
$16.77 um if there aren't people that
 
07:00:59.788 --> 07:00:59.798 align:start position:0%
can come in to to to pay
 
07:01:03.670 --> 07:01:03.680 align:start position:0%
$16.77 cents for a burger um or somebody
 
07:01:05.030 --> 07:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
comes in and eats that burger and
 
07:01:07.110 --> 07:01:07.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't leave a tip then the employer
 
07:01:10.270 --> 07:01:10.280 align:start position:0%
only has to make pay my server $725 an
 
07:01:11.990 --> 07:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
hour for her time and that's not enough
 
07:01:13.628 --> 07:01:13.638 align:start position:0%
to feed her family and keep a roof over
 
07:01:17.070 --> 07:01:17.080 align:start position:0%
their heads you know and then I also
 
07:01:18.910 --> 07:01:18.920 align:start position:0%
will have to fit foot the bill for the
 
07:01:20.910 --> 07:01:20.920 align:start position:0%
subsidies you know the reality is that
 
07:01:23.750 --> 07:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
tipped workers and the reality for
 
07:01:26.310 --> 07:01:26.320 align:start position:0%
consumers you know it's a broken system
 
07:01:28.510 --> 07:01:28.520 align:start position:0%
and and it needs to be
 
07:01:31.990 --> 07:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
fixed you know it cost it it requires
 
07:01:34.670 --> 07:01:34.680 align:start position:0%
just as much energy for somebody to
 
07:01:38.110 --> 07:01:38.120 align:start position:0%
bring me an English muffin and a coffee
 
07:01:40.070 --> 07:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
if I'm not that hungry as it does for
 
07:01:42.830 --> 07:01:42.840 align:start position:0%
them to bring me you know a $40 steak
 
07:01:45.310 --> 07:01:45.320 align:start position:0%
and um they deserve you know that work
 
07:01:47.548 --> 07:01:47.558 align:start position:0%
has dignity because I really appreciate
 
07:01:50.190 --> 07:01:50.200 align:start position:0%
them refilling my coffee cup and I in
 
07:01:51.830 --> 07:01:51.840 align:start position:0%
those occasions I do try to tip more
 
07:01:51.840 --> 07:01:52.510 align:start position:0%
those occasions I do try to tip more
than

07:01:52.510 --> 07:01:52.520 align:start position:0%
than
 
07:01:56.430 --> 07:01:56.440 align:start position:0%
20% um because you know if my bill is
 
07:01:58.590 --> 07:01:58.600 align:start position:0%
that low that it's just really not not
 
07:02:02.670 --> 07:02:02.680 align:start position:0%
worth it for them um the bottom line is
 
07:02:04.868 --> 07:02:04.878 align:start position:0%
that while New Hampshire is low known to
 
07:02:07.270 --> 07:02:07.280 align:start position:0%
have this low poty rate on paper the
 
07:02:08.868 --> 07:02:08.878 align:start position:0%
reality is that there are thousands of
 
07:02:10.990 --> 07:02:11.000 align:start position:0%
people who are struggling an estimated
 
07:02:13.628 --> 07:02:13.638 align:start position:0%
47% of people in the state are rent
 
07:02:15.190 --> 07:02:15.200 align:start position:0%
burdened which means they spend more
 
07:02:17.910 --> 07:02:17.920 align:start position:0%
than 50% of their of 30% of their income
 
07:02:20.750 --> 07:02:20.760 align:start position:0%
on housing um some people spend as much
 
07:02:23.548 --> 07:02:23.558 align:start position:0%
as 50% of their inome income on housing
 
07:02:26.310 --> 07:02:26.320 align:start position:0%
um you know this body has the ability to
 
07:02:28.670 --> 07:02:28.680 align:start position:0%
determine um that the New Hampshire
 
07:02:30.350 --> 07:02:30.360 align:start position:0%
Advantage is something that helps
 
07:02:33.788 --> 07:02:33.798 align:start position:0%
corporations make profits or that helps
 
07:02:35.670 --> 07:02:35.680 align:start position:0%
people who live here make a decent life
 
07:02:38.670 --> 07:02:38.680 align:start position:0%
for themselves and and I think that
 
07:02:41.310 --> 07:02:41.320 align:start position:0%
that's New Hampshire is a great place to
 
07:02:43.350 --> 07:02:43.360 align:start position:0%
live and I think raising the minimum
 
07:02:45.788 --> 07:02:45.798 align:start position:0%
wage would help more people be able to
 
07:02:49.830 --> 07:02:49.840 align:start position:0%
do that um thank you thank you for your
 
07:02:53.030 --> 07:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
testimony are there any questions for
 
07:02:55.830 --> 07:02:55.840 align:start position:0%
this Witness
 
07:02:58.548 --> 07:02:58.558 align:start position:0%
online I see no hands anybody from the
 
07:02:58.558 --> 07:02:59.468 align:start position:0%
online I see no hands anybody from the
committee

07:02:59.468 --> 07:02:59.478 align:start position:0%
committee
 
07:03:02.830 --> 07:03:02.840 align:start position:0%
room seeing none thank you
 
07:03:08.070 --> 07:03:08.080 align:start position:0%
again do we have other people waiting to
 
07:03:14.230 --> 07:03:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:16.628 --> 07:03:16.638 align:start position:0%
up uh we had a question from the
 
07:03:19.910 --> 07:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
committee room how many hands do you see
 
07:03:23.350 --> 07:03:23.360 align:start position:0%
now uh two two more hands all right
 
07:03:26.430 --> 07:03:26.440 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Miss Sears you are
 
07:03:28.430 --> 07:03:28.440 align:start position:0%
recognized to
 
07:03:31.670 --> 07:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
speak hi and thank you uh this is Amanda
 
07:03:33.628 --> 07:03:33.638 align:start position:0%
Sears uh director of the campaign for
 
07:03:36.670 --> 07:03:36.680 align:start position:0%
familyfriendly economy um I wanted to
 
07:03:40.548 --> 07:03:40.558 align:start position:0%
testify in support of this bill um and
 
07:03:42.510 --> 07:03:42.520 align:start position:0%
just to simplify it just to say that
 
07:03:44.910 --> 07:03:44.920 align:start position:0%
when jobs don't pay enough um working
 
07:03:47.750 --> 07:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
people can't pay their bills um and uh
 
07:03:51.070 --> 07:03:51.080 align:start position:0%
that's not a sustainable um way for
 
07:03:53.310 --> 07:03:53.320 align:start position:0%
people to live in this state and what
 
07:03:55.750 --> 07:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
happens often is that um then working
 
07:03:57.670 --> 07:03:57.680 align:start position:0%
people turn to public assistance to meet
 
07:04:01.110 --> 07:04:01.120 align:start position:0%
their basic needs um even before the
 
07:04:03.628 --> 07:04:03.638 align:start position:0%
pandemic one-third of recipients of cash
 
07:04:06.150 --> 07:04:06.160 align:start position:0%
assistance benefits um from the tanif
 
07:04:09.430 --> 07:04:09.440 align:start position:0%
program and 36% of recipients of food
 
07:04:11.270 --> 07:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
stamp benefits in New Hampshire are
 
07:04:14.430 --> 07:04:14.440 align:start position:0%
working families New Hampshire um this
 
07:04:16.670 --> 07:04:16.680 align:start position:0%
is pre pandemic um and I think it's
 
07:04:18.430 --> 07:04:18.440 align:start position:0%
probably only worse but but just to say
 
07:04:19.628 --> 07:04:19.638 align:start position:0%
that these numbers are pre-pandemic
 
07:04:21.788 --> 07:04:21.798 align:start position:0%
numbers New Hampshire is one of the
 
07:04:23.750 --> 07:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
states with the highest percentages of
 
07:04:26.830 --> 07:04:26.840 align:start position:0%
Public Assistance funds um with over 60%
 
07:04:29.388 --> 07:04:29.398 align:start position:0%
of those funds going to working families
 
07:04:31.628 --> 07:04:31.638 align:start position:0%
so we often think of Public Assistance
 
07:04:34.190 --> 07:04:34.200 align:start position:0%
going to people who are not working but
 
07:04:36.350 --> 07:04:36.360 align:start position:0%
in fact 60% of our Public Assistance
 
07:04:38.070 --> 07:04:38.080 align:start position:0%
funds in New Hampshire go to Working
 
07:04:41.590 --> 07:04:41.600 align:start position:0%
Families um and these programs provide
 
07:04:43.430 --> 07:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
vital support to to these Working
 
07:04:45.868 --> 07:04:45.878 align:start position:0%
Families um and they need that support
 
07:04:47.788 --> 07:04:47.798 align:start position:0%
because their employers are paying them
 
07:04:50.670 --> 07:04:50.680 align:start position:0%
less than livable wages and that's a
 
07:04:53.468 --> 07:04:53.478 align:start position:0%
hidden social cost of low wage work that
 
07:04:55.910 --> 07:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
the rest of us um are all covering for
 
07:04:57.830 --> 07:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
for those employers who choose to pay
 
07:04:59.548 --> 07:04:59.558 align:start position:0%
less than livable wages to their
 
07:05:02.590 --> 07:05:02.600 align:start position:0%
employees um so just um wanted to add
 
07:05:04.110 --> 07:05:04.120 align:start position:0%
our voice in support of this bill and
 
07:05:06.388 --> 07:05:06.398 align:start position:0%

Holt Mr

recognized hello can you hear me
 
07:05:40.110 --> 07:05:40.120 align:start position:0%
yes thank you very much I am uh just
 
07:05:42.468 --> 07:05:42.478 align:start position:0%
calling in on behalf of myself uh from
 
07:05:44.990 --> 07:05:45.000 align:start position:0%
summersworth New Hampshire um what I
 
07:05:47.070 --> 07:05:47.080 align:start position:0%
wanted to address was a previous
 
07:05:50.430 --> 07:05:50.440 align:start position:0%
statement regarding um the fact that
 
07:05:55.110 --> 07:05:55.120 align:start position:0%
this was a a going to be basically um
 
07:05:57.430 --> 07:05:57.440 align:start position:0%
causing someone that is only worth
 
07:06:01.430 --> 07:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
$725 an hour to be unemployed uh that is
 
07:06:01.440 --> 07:06:02.310 align:start position:0%
$725 an hour to be unemployed uh that is
a

07:06:02.310 --> 07:06:02.320 align:start position:0%
a
 
07:06:06.150 --> 07:06:06.160 align:start position:0%
bogus uh perspective to to look at there
 
07:06:09.270 --> 07:06:09.280 align:start position:0%
there's no foundation for that um the
 
07:06:12.070 --> 07:06:12.080 align:start position:0%
basically whatever someone who is doing
 
07:06:14.670 --> 07:06:14.680 align:start position:0%
the the most basic work if they are
 
07:06:19.628 --> 07:06:19.638 align:start position:0%
working fulltime uh for a um for a week
 
07:06:23.430 --> 07:06:23.440 align:start position:0%
they need to be able to to uh afford the
 
07:06:27.310 --> 07:06:27.320 align:start position:0%
basic necessities of life rent food uh
 
07:06:31.388 --> 07:06:31.398 align:start position:0%
shelter Etc um it is totally objective
 
07:06:34.670 --> 07:06:34.680 align:start position:0%
and and farcical to say that someone is
 
07:06:38.750 --> 07:06:38.760 align:start position:0%
only worth $725 an hour I would love to
 
07:06:41.388 --> 07:06:41.398 align:start position:0%
have see anybody uh do some of these
 
07:06:44.548 --> 07:06:44.558 align:start position:0%
jobs from uh being a ditch digger all
 
07:06:47.910 --> 07:06:47.920 align:start position:0%
day long to uh working at a fast food
 
07:06:50.628 --> 07:06:50.638 align:start position:0%
restaurant Etc uh there is a lot of work
 
07:06:50.638 --> 07:06:52.030 align:start position:0%
restaurant Etc uh there is a lot of work
involved

07:06:52.030 --> 07:06:52.040 align:start position:0%
involved
 
07:06:55.468 --> 07:06:55.478 align:start position:0%
but the basis really that saying 725 is
 
07:06:58.830 --> 07:06:58.840 align:start position:0%
then going to um cause these people to
 
07:07:01.270 --> 07:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
be unemployed it's it's actually really
 
07:07:03.868 --> 07:07:03.878 align:start position:0%
ridiculous because the state and
 
07:07:06.468 --> 07:07:06.478 align:start position:0%
government has already recognized that
 
07:07:08.270 --> 07:07:08.280 align:start position:0%
people can't live on this so these
 
07:07:11.150 --> 07:07:11.160 align:start position:0%
people are actually being um they're
 
07:07:12.948 --> 07:07:12.958 align:start position:0%
having to go for government assistance
 
07:07:15.070 --> 07:07:15.080 align:start position:0%
which is almost like another job having
 
07:07:17.270 --> 07:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
to go through the loopholes in order to
 
07:07:19.670 --> 07:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
receive that assistance
 
07:07:22.868 --> 07:07:22.878 align:start position:0%
um and that is being sub so so it ends
 
07:07:25.830 --> 07:07:25.840 align:start position:0%
up that the employer is being subsidized
 
07:07:29.070 --> 07:07:29.080 align:start position:0%
by uh the rest of the community uh
 
07:07:32.230 --> 07:07:32.240 align:start position:0%
rather for for doing something that uh
 
07:07:34.310 --> 07:07:34.320 align:start position:0%
they should actually be paying for
 
07:07:37.548 --> 07:07:37.558 align:start position:0%
themselves um so again it is totally
 
07:07:39.788 --> 07:07:39.798 align:start position:0%
objective there's there's no standing to
 
07:07:42.708 --> 07:07:42.718 align:start position:0%
say that someone is not worth 725 an
 
07:07:44.990 --> 07:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
hour that's really insulting the basis
 
07:07:47.030 --> 07:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
really needs to be on what would be the
 
07:07:48.990 --> 07:07:49.000 align:start position:0%
minimum for someone to live which is
 
07:07:51.628 --> 07:07:51.638 align:start position:0%
exactly the intent of the minimum wage
 
07:07:53.868 --> 07:07:53.878 align:start position:0%
uh which is also lied about
 
07:07:57.270 --> 07:07:57.280 align:start position:0%
continuously um so again we need to make
 
07:07:59.830 --> 07:07:59.840 align:start position:0%
sure that we actually have a living wage
 
07:08:03.948 --> 07:08:03.958 align:start position:0%
for all people uh and that way uh people
 
07:08:06.590 --> 07:08:06.600 align:start position:0%
can live in dignity uh thank you very
 
07:08:09.350 --> 07:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
much thank you for your testimony are
 
07:08:11.708 --> 07:08:11.718 align:start position:0%

are there any other hands from people
 
07:08:27.468 --> 07:08:27.478 align:start position:0%
who wanted to testify on this bill but
 
07:08:31.628 --> 07:08:31.638 align:start position:0%
did not yet get a chance I have one more
 
07:08:37.788 --> 07:08:37.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:08:41.590 --> 07:08:41.600 align:start position:0%

representing uh the granite state
 
07:09:17.548 --> 07:09:17.558 align:start position:0%
organizing project we are a Grassroots
 
07:09:20.150 --> 07:09:20.160 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan institution that brings
 
07:09:22.510 --> 07:09:22.520 align:start position:0%
Faith labor and Community groups to work
 
07:09:25.750 --> 07:09:25.760 align:start position:0%
towards um a just World basically and
 
07:09:27.910 --> 07:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
and I'm here to express my support for
 
07:09:31.590 --> 07:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
HB 107 along with um HP
 
07:09:34.910 --> 07:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
517 I submitted a written testimony for
 
07:09:38.830 --> 07:09:38.840 align:start position:0%
HP 517 so if it's okay I'd like to speak
 
07:09:40.388 --> 07:09:40.398 align:start position:0%
on HB
 
07:09:44.670 --> 07:09:44.680 align:start position:0%
107 um if the minimum wage had kept uh
 
07:09:47.270 --> 07:09:47.280 align:start position:0%
Pace with the productivity grow uh from
 
07:09:49.510 --> 07:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
1938 when the minimum wage was
 
07:09:52.110 --> 07:09:52.120 align:start position:0%
established today you would be more than
 
07:09:55.750 --> 07:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
$24 an hour um and that that that
 
07:09:58.468 --> 07:09:58.478 align:start position:0%
analysis was done by a group called
 
07:10:01.548 --> 07:10:01.558 align:start position:0%
Center for economic and policy research
 
07:10:03.310 --> 07:10:03.320 align:start position:0%
um but instead our minimum wage has
 
07:10:06.708 --> 07:10:06.718 align:start position:0%
really stayed the same at $725 an hour
 
07:10:09.788 --> 07:10:09.798 align:start position:0%
in the meantime food prices have risen
 
07:10:11.590 --> 07:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
year after year rent has gone up
 
07:10:14.388 --> 07:10:14.398 align:start position:0%
healthcare costs but nothing uh has been
 
07:10:17.430 --> 07:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
done about our minimum W in the State uh
 
07:10:19.468 --> 07:10:19.478 align:start position:0%
so we should be asking ourselves why is
 
07:10:22.350 --> 07:10:22.360 align:start position:0%
it okay that we allow such a system
 
07:10:24.510 --> 07:10:24.520 align:start position:0%
uh that continues to squeeze working
 
07:10:29.510 --> 07:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
people um this body and our entire legis
 
07:10:32.150 --> 07:10:32.160 align:start position:0%
body in newshire has an opportunity to
 
07:10:36.110 --> 07:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
pass policies such as this and uh
 
07:10:37.910 --> 07:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
minimum wage bills Bally that will
 
07:10:39.868 --> 07:10:39.878 align:start position:0%
benefit both workers and local
 
07:10:42.430 --> 07:10:42.440 align:start position:0%
businesses um I know our previous
 
07:10:45.030 --> 07:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
speakers have quoted different numbers
 
07:10:47.510 --> 07:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
and I would like to really uh again
 
07:10:50.990 --> 07:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
share um the cost of living here and put
 
07:10:54.628 --> 07:10:54.638 align:start position:0%
that into reality um the national law
 
07:10:56.910 --> 07:10:56.920 align:start position:0%
Income Housing Coalition did an analysis
 
07:11:00.910 --> 07:11:00.920 align:start position:0%
and study and found out that uh for a
 
07:11:02.510 --> 07:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
person to afford a two-bedroom
 
07:11:04.468 --> 07:11:04.478 align:start position:0%
apartments in New Hampshire they would
 
07:11:08.190 --> 07:11:08.200 align:start position:0%
have to earn at least $23 an hour um and
 
07:11:11.350 --> 07:11:11.360 align:start position:0%
if that person was working at $725 an
 
07:11:15.548 --> 07:11:15.558 align:start position:0%
hour they had to put in 129 hours a week
 
07:11:18.110 --> 07:11:18.120 align:start position:0%
to afford the two modest bedroom
 
07:11:21.468 --> 07:11:21.478 align:start position:0%
apartments um and so that is the reality
 
07:11:23.388 --> 07:11:23.398 align:start position:0%
of what workers in Hampshire are going
 
07:11:27.310 --> 07:11:27.320 align:start position:0%
through um there's another uh a lot of a
 
07:11:30.150 --> 07:11:30.160 align:start position:0%
lot has been said about calculators
 
07:11:32.708 --> 07:11:32.718 align:start position:0%
there's one by the economic policy
 
07:11:34.948 --> 07:11:34.958 align:start position:0%
Institute uh it's called a family budget
 
07:11:37.350 --> 07:11:37.360 align:start position:0%
calculator I encourage all of you to
 
07:11:39.468 --> 07:11:39.478 align:start position:0%
look at that and look at what people in
 
07:11:41.750 --> 07:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
your uh counties need to actually
 
07:11:44.430 --> 07:11:44.440 align:start position:0%
survive and an example of that is if
 
07:11:46.750 --> 07:11:46.760 align:start position:0%
there's one working adult with one child
 
07:11:49.150 --> 07:11:49.160 align:start position:0%
in Coast County they need to be making
 
07:11:53.868 --> 07:11:53.878 align:start position:0%
at least 50,000 a year or over 4,000 a
 
07:11:55.990 --> 07:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
month to pay for basic needs such as
 
07:11:57.670 --> 07:11:57.680 align:start position:0%
food housing child care and
 
07:11:59.948 --> 07:11:59.958 align:start position:0%
transportation and other assists that we
 
07:12:03.510 --> 07:12:03.520 align:start position:0%
need to survive in comparison a similar
 
07:12:06.190 --> 07:12:06.200 align:start position:0%
family that lives in hillsbor County
 
07:12:07.990 --> 07:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
would need about
 
07:12:12.590 --> 07:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
$61,000 annually or over $5,000 monthly
 
07:12:14.750 --> 07:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
and when you calculate that it
 
07:12:17.388 --> 07:12:17.398 align:start position:0%
translates to $24 an hour at least in Co
 
07:12:21.750 --> 07:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
County and about $29 in hillsbor County
 
07:12:24.990 --> 07:12:25.000 align:start position:0%
so I spoke with a worker today who I was
 
07:12:27.230 --> 07:12:27.240 align:start position:0%
hopy would be on this call to share
 
07:12:29.708 --> 07:12:29.718 align:start position:0%
their story um and he told me that he
 
07:12:32.150 --> 07:12:32.160 align:start position:0%
has to drive from Manchester to
 
07:12:34.350 --> 07:12:34.360 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts because he gets paid over
 
07:12:37.510 --> 07:12:37.520 align:start position:0%
$15 over there um he can't get the same
 
07:12:40.830 --> 07:12:40.840 align:start position:0%
pay here so he would rather he would
 
07:12:43.628 --> 07:12:43.638 align:start position:0%
rather not commute but even with the
 
07:12:46.948 --> 07:12:46.958 align:start position:0%
cost of gas and the time that he he puts
 
07:12:49.070 --> 07:12:49.080 align:start position:0%
him to drive back and forth he still
 
07:12:50.788 --> 07:12:50.798 align:start position:0%
makes better money in Massachusetts than
 
07:12:50.798 --> 07:12:52.548 align:start position:0%
makes better money in Massachusetts than
here

07:12:52.548 --> 07:12:52.558 align:start position:0%
here
 
07:12:55.628 --> 07:12:55.638 align:start position:0%
uh we did hear about um how increasing
 
07:12:57.510 --> 07:12:57.520 align:start position:0%
the minimum wage really affects
 
07:12:59.548 --> 07:12:59.558 align:start position:0%
businesses uh and a lot of speak has
 
07:13:02.030 --> 07:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
really mentioned this earlier we know
 
07:13:04.948 --> 07:13:04.958 align:start position:0%
that by raising the wages uh people have
 
07:13:07.230 --> 07:13:07.240 align:start position:0%
higher incomes and with higher incomes
 
07:13:09.990 --> 07:13:10.000 align:start position:0%
comes more stending powerful workers um
 
07:13:11.510 --> 07:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
and we know during this pandemic it's
 
07:13:14.350 --> 07:13:14.360 align:start position:0%
been very difficult for small businesses
 
07:13:16.868 --> 07:13:16.878 align:start position:0%
um but what we should be doing we should
 
07:13:19.270 --> 07:13:19.280 align:start position:0%
be focusing on making sure that we bring
 
07:13:22.750 --> 07:13:22.760 align:start position:0%
in demand for goods and services in our
 
07:13:25.190 --> 07:13:25.200 align:start position:0%
state so that people are spending money
 
07:13:27.910 --> 07:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
and that money is helping really um
 
07:13:30.708 --> 07:13:30.718 align:start position:0%
stimulate the economy um the businesses
 
07:13:32.910 --> 07:13:32.920 align:start position:0%
that shut down were mostly take care um
 
07:13:35.628 --> 07:13:35.638 align:start position:0%
to slow down the spread of coid 19 uh
 
07:13:38.430 --> 07:13:38.440 align:start position:0%
but that also came due to reduced demand
 
07:13:39.910 --> 07:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
for goods and services because people do
 
07:13:42.510 --> 07:13:42.520 align:start position:0%
not have money to spend so if we're
 
07:13:44.910 --> 07:13:44.920 align:start position:0%
thinking of helping businesses we should
 
07:13:47.270 --> 07:13:47.280 align:start position:0%
be thinking of other options like
 
07:13:49.590 --> 07:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
helping businesses with rent subsidies
 
07:13:51.708 --> 07:13:51.718 align:start position:0%
learning programs but keeping the
 
07:13:55.310 --> 07:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
minimum wage at $725 an hour is not the
 
07:13:57.750 --> 07:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
solution um again I submitted by
 
07:13:59.910 --> 07:13:59.920 align:start position:0%

07:14:03.270 --> 07:14:03.280 align:start position:0%

07:19:06.070 --> 07:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
right know how to get in touch with me
 
07:19:09.948 --> 07:19:09.958 align:start position:0%
is that a question yes um I I was
 
07:19:12.150 --> 07:19:12.160 align:start position:0%
looking at the email that you sent with
 
07:19:13.548 --> 07:19:13.558 align:start position:0%
the number of H bills that we're going
 
07:19:16.548 --> 07:19:16.558 align:start position:0%
to exec next week and I was looking also
 
07:19:18.150 --> 07:19:18.160 align:start position:0%
at the calendar and it seemed like the
 
07:19:21.868 --> 07:19:21.878 align:start position:0%
calendar had um several additional bills
 
07:19:24.670 --> 07:19:24.680 align:start position:0%
um so um if you could just check that
 
07:19:26.468 --> 07:19:26.478 align:start position:0%
out like we don't want to prep for bills
 
07:19:28.948 --> 07:19:28.958 align:start position:0%
that we're not actually going to exec so
 
07:19:30.750 --> 07:19:30.760 align:start position:0%
if you could just double check that and
 
07:19:34.468 --> 07:19:34.478 align:start position:0%
let us know if uh um if if I'm correct
 
07:19:37.468 --> 07:19:37.478 align:start position:0%
and the lists don't match if you could
 
07:19:39.310 --> 07:19:39.320 align:start position:0%
let us know which list to
 
07:19:41.788 --> 07:19:41.798 align:start position:0%
use use the calendar please what
 
07:19:44.070 --> 07:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
occurred honestly is I tried to get that
 
07:19:45.990 --> 07:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
thing out first thing Wednesday morning
 
07:19:49.708 --> 07:19:49.718 align:start position:0%
to help with um Heather and her schedule
 
07:19:52.430 --> 07:19:52.440 align:start position:0%
so it wasn't doing it at 12:00 in the
 
07:19:55.270 --> 07:19:55.280 align:start position:0%
afternoon and as I kept reading my stuff
 
07:19:56.910 --> 07:19:56.920 align:start position:0%
and getting emails from all of you
 
07:19:59.110 --> 07:19:59.120 align:start position:0%

07:20:00.910 --> 07:20:00.920 align:start position:0%
forgot Brian's last bill we had to put
 
07:20:02.468 --> 07:20:02.478 align:start position:0%

07:20:04.270 --> 07:20:04.280 align:start position:0%
going to be okay I can pull an amendment
 
07:20:06.510 --> 07:20:06.520 align:start position:0%
