00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:35.699 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 align:start position:0%

really busy day today and we also are
 
00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 align:start position:0%
operating under some time constraints
 
00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 align:start position:0%
because we have next week is kind of the
 
00:04:58.129 --> 00:04:58.139 align:start position:0%
last day for us to report so what I'd

like to uh just do at the at the outset
 
00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 align:start position:0%
is is kind of set out um is kind of give
 
00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 align:start position:0%

we're going to have the hearing on the
 
00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
amendment to HB 533
 
00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 align:start position:0%
because we're operating under time
 
00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
constraints and I know that there are a
 
00:05:20.749 --> 00:05:20.759 align:start position:0%
number of people who have expressed a
 
00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:23.100 align:start position:0%
desire to testify I'm going to limit
 
00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:26.100 align:start position:0%
testimony uh to two minutes each for
 
00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 align:start position:0%
every anyone who wishes to testify um
 
00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 align:start position:0%
with regard to that
 
00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:33.900 align:start position:0%
then at 10 o'clock hopefully we will
 
00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:35.880 align:start position:0%
have the hearing on that done by 10
 
00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:38.160 align:start position:0%

session on the bills that have been
 
00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
noticed I would note and I do this as
 
00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000 align:start position:0%

hour uh in addition to that
 
00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:02.220 align:start position:0%
um and I don't know whether this is in
 
00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:03.780 align:start position:0%
light of the fact that we now have this
 
00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:05.160 align:start position:0%

conducting
 
00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
investigations of educator misconduct is
 
00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:48.660 align:start position:0%
not about commissioner Frank edelblut
 
00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:52.020 align:start position:0%
it's not for commissioner Frank edelblue
 
00:07:55.309 --> 00:07:55.319 align:start position:0%
it is for uh investigator Richard
 
00:07:58.610 --> 00:07:58.620 align:start position:0%
Farrell in order for him to conduct his
 
00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:00.110 align:start position:0%
Farrell in order for him to conduct his

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:00.120 align:start position:0%
investigations
 
00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:02.340 align:start position:0%
the department has been working very
 
00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:04.860 align:start position:0%
hard over the past few years to enhance
 
00:08:07.129 --> 00:08:07.139 align:start position:0%
our child safety initiatives we have
 
00:08:09.309 --> 00:08:09.319 align:start position:0%
seen various stories in the news
 
00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
where the department has been working on
 
00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
on addressing those matters Concord
 
00:08:16.129 --> 00:08:16.139 align:start position:0%
always comes to mind
 
00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:18.840 align:start position:0%
um where we are finding Educators who
 
00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:20.160 align:start position:0%
should not be around children who are
 
00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:21.720 align:start position:0%
having inappropriate relationships with
 
00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:23.280 align:start position:0%
children they are few and far between
 
00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:25.860 align:start position:0%
but they're very very important and
 
00:08:27.589 --> 00:08:27.599 align:start position:0%
critically important
 
00:08:29.869 --> 00:08:29.879 align:start position:0%
the code of conduct was passed in 2018
 
00:08:32.149 --> 00:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
and under that document the department
 
00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
conducts investigations of educator
 
00:08:36.649 --> 00:08:36.659 align:start position:0%
misconduct and subpoena power which
 
00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:38.940 align:start position:0%
other state agencies have in order to
 
00:08:42.649 --> 00:08:42.659 align:start position:0%
facilitate their investigations oplc as
 
00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:45.660 align:start position:0%
a point case in point has subpoena power
 
00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:48.720 align:start position:0%
would help to facilitate that but you
 
00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:50.820 align:start position:0%
don't have to take my word for it that's
 
00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:53.100 align:start position:0%
why Richard Farrell is here to speak on
 
00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:55.320 align:start position:0%
the work that he does
 
00:08:57.410 --> 00:08:57.420 align:start position:0%
please good morning my name is Richard
 
00:08:59.449 --> 00:08:59.459 align:start position:0%
Farrell I'm currently employed by the
 
00:09:00.829 --> 00:09:00.839 align:start position:0%
Department of Education as an
 
00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:03.360 align:start position:0%
investigator I began this mission on
 
00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:06.360 align:start position:0%
July 1st 2013. you know Mr Falcon I just
 
00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:07.800 align:start position:0%
ask you when you I'm not going to
 
00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:09.360 align:start position:0%
interrupt you now but before you leave
 
00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:10.620 align:start position:0%
would you just fill out one of the pink
 
00:09:12.949 --> 00:09:12.959 align:start position:0%
cards yes sir thank you
 
00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
um I began this mission in July 1st 2013
 
00:09:17.509 --> 00:09:17.519 align:start position:0%
after serving 30 years as a member of
 
00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:19.320 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire State Police before
 
00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:21.540 align:start position:0%
that I was a licensed educator I spent
 
00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:23.100 align:start position:0%
three years teaching high school English
 
00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:25.140 align:start position:0%
and coaching football in Massachusetts
 
00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:27.180 align:start position:0%
and in a private school in Southern New
 
00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:28.070 align:start position:0%
and in a private school in Southern New
Hampshire

00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:09:30.829 --> 00:09:30.839 align:start position:0%
at the time of my employment the New
 
00:09:32.329 --> 00:09:32.339 align:start position:0%
Hampshire New Hampshire relied on
 
00:09:33.769 --> 00:09:33.779 align:start position:0%
administrative rules to define the
 
00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:35.640 align:start position:0%
conduct to Define and conduct
 
00:09:37.269 --> 00:09:37.279 align:start position:0%
investigations into allegations
 
00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:40.380 align:start position:0%
associated with educated misconduct the
 
00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:42.360 align:start position:0%
code of conduct didn't exist at all
 
00:09:44.269 --> 00:09:44.279 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I learned very quickly
 
00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:46.140 align:start position:0%
that the tools available to me to
 
00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:47.940 align:start position:0%
complete my assigned cases were very
 
00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
limited in fact I didn't have any at all
 
00:09:54.769 --> 00:09:54.779 align:start position:0%
therefore the best approach forward for
 
00:09:56.509 --> 00:09:56.519 align:start position:0%
me was to make the determined effort to
 
00:09:59.509 --> 00:09:59.519 align:start position:0%
identify myself to create relationships
 
00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:01.320 align:start position:0%
with and cultivate trust with the field
 
00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:03.540 align:start position:0%
this included with superintendents
 
00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
principals Union attorneys Union reps
 
00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:07.860 align:start position:0%
attorneys representing school districts
 
00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
and other stakeholders at first and very
 
00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
understandably there was skepticism
 
00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
but I am I'm a person of Irish heritage
 
00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:18.540 align:start position:0%
and I've been gifted with the ability to
 
00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
tell people where to go and convince
 
00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:22.220 align:start position:0%
them to look forward to the trip
 
00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:25.260 align:start position:0%
you see I had no tools I had no warrants
 
00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
I had no subpoenas I just had
 
00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:30.300 align:start position:0%
administrative rules and relationships
 
00:10:32.449 --> 00:10:32.459 align:start position:0%
I asked Dr Judy Fillion almost
 
00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:35.100 align:start position:0%
immediately my immediate supervisor
 
00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:37.140 align:start position:0%
legendary Dr philion
 
00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:39.420 align:start position:0%
why we didn't at least have subpoena
 
00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:40.980 align:start position:0%
Powers while other investigators
 
00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:43.080 align:start position:0%
overseeing licensure had that tool over
 
00:10:45.949 --> 00:10:45.959 align:start position:0%
at oplc I didn't get a reasonable answer
 
00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:48.360 align:start position:0%
and I'd been asking ever since for 10
 
00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:49.069 align:start position:0%
and I'd been asking ever since for 10
years

00:10:49.069 --> 00:10:49.079 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:10:50.449 --> 00:10:50.459 align:start position:0%
I think it's very important to
 
00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
understand very definitively that my
 
00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:54.240 align:start position:0%
first and most important mission is to
 
00:10:56.509 --> 00:10:56.519 align:start position:0%
keep Kids Safe
 
00:10:58.430 --> 00:10:58.440 align:start position:0%
I have been called to public service for
 
00:10:59.810 --> 00:10:59.820 align:start position:0%
nearly 40 years and I take this
 
00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
responsibility very very seriously this
 
00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:04.380 align:start position:0%
is about kid keeping kids in our school
 
00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:06.300 align:start position:0%
safe and protecting them from the one
 
00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
percent of Educators who do not share in
 
00:11:09.949 --> 00:11:09.959 align:start position:0%
this belief
 
00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:12.720 align:start position:0%
that's right one percent
 
00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:15.660 align:start position:0%
I work for commissioner Barry I now work
 
00:11:17.569 --> 00:11:17.579 align:start position:0%
for commissioner edelblue and God
 
00:11:18.829 --> 00:11:18.839 align:start position:0%
willing I will work for another
 
00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:21.660 align:start position:0%
commissioner in the future this is not
 
00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:23.700 align:start position:0%
as a local newspaper to trumpeted this
 
00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
past Sunday edelblood seeks subpoena
 
00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
power to investigate educated misconduct
 
00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
that's not what this is about
 
00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:33.540 align:start position:0%
I am asking the agency is asking and we
 
00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
need to do three things this request has
 
00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:38.220 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with political agenda on
 
00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:40.680 align:start position:0%
me carrying water for any commissioner
 
00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:42.600 align:start position:0%
I need these tools to complete my
 
00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:43.430 align:start position:0%
I need these tools to complete my
mission

00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
mission
 
00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:45.420 align:start position:0%
the three-prong mission is protect our
 
00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:47.700 align:start position:0%
most vulnerable neighbors our children
 
00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
protect our educators
 
00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:51.480 align:start position:0%
that's right well over ninety percent of
 
00:11:53.389 --> 00:11:53.399 align:start position:0%
our cases alleging misconduct are deemed
 
00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:56.040 align:start position:0%
to be unfounded we exonerate more
 
00:11:59.630 --> 00:11:59.640 align:start position:0%
teachers every day than we do
 
00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:01.860 align:start position:0%
take action against the license of a
 
00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:02.690 align:start position:0%
take action against the license of a
teacher

00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:02.700 align:start position:0%
teacher
 
00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
over the past 10 years I've been
 
00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:07.860 align:start position:0%
investigated on average 150 cases that
 
00:12:11.329 --> 00:12:11.339 align:start position:0%
we log in as cases to meet our triage
 
00:12:11.339 --> 00:12:14.449 align:start position:0%
we log in as cases to meet our triage
process

00:12:14.449 --> 00:12:14.459 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:16.680 align:start position:0%
in any given year we take action
 
00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:19.500 align:start position:0%
suspensions or revocations involving
 
00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:23.640 align:start position:0%
10 Educators on average
 
00:12:26.509 --> 00:12:26.519 align:start position:0%
this does not count the many reports we
 
00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
get that do not survive our triage
 
00:12:30.829 --> 00:12:30.839 align:start position:0%
process and finally the third part of
 
00:12:32.449 --> 00:12:32.459 align:start position:0%
our mission is to remove
 
00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:36.120 align:start position:0%
Educators that did damaging our kids
 
00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
over the past 10 years I've been faced
 
00:12:39.889 --> 00:12:39.899 align:start position:0%
with difficult tasks of asking for
 
00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:41.940 align:start position:0%
information many times I've been dying
 
00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
access to reports statements witness
 
00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:46.260 align:start position:0%
information names ages local
 
00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:48.360 align:start position:0%
disciplinary records investigative
 
00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:49.980 align:start position:0%
findings and other crucial bits of
 
00:12:51.769 --> 00:12:51.779 align:start position:0%
evidence that would have assisted in
 
00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
protecting students exonerating
 
00:12:56.509 --> 00:12:56.519 align:start position:0%
Educators falsely accused and removing
 
00:12:58.910 --> 00:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
bad apples from our classrooms I'm sorry
 
00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:00.540 align:start position:0%
did you say you said you had been denied
 
00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
access is that what you're saying that's
 
00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:03.290 align:start position:0%
access is that what you're saying that's
correct

00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:03.300 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:13:05.269 --> 00:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
over the past two to three years school
 
00:13:06.769 --> 00:13:06.779 align:start position:0%
districts are routinely hiring
 
00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:09.420 align:start position:0%
third-party investigators attorneys that
 
00:13:11.449 --> 00:13:11.459 align:start position:0%
work for the districts as contractors
 
00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:14.360 align:start position:0%
and in fact a new company has been
 
00:13:17.329 --> 00:13:17.339 align:start position:0%
started that focuses strictly on
 
00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:19.740 align:start position:0%
providing third-party investigations for
 
00:13:23.329 --> 00:13:23.339 align:start position:0%
school districts most of the time we are
 
00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:26.160 align:start position:0%
not allowed to look at those reports we
 
00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
don't have subpoena power to get those
 
00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:29.700 align:start position:0%
reports sometimes we're allowed to
 
00:13:32.449 --> 00:13:32.459 align:start position:0%
review them in camera in in a conference
 
00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
room at a law firm and glean the
 
00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:37.500 align:start position:0%
information from those many times we're
 
00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:40.079 align:start position:0%
not allowed to touch them at all many of
 
00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:41.940 align:start position:0%
our most difficult and heinous cases
 
00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:43.620 align:start position:0%
involving the exploitation of our
 
00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:45.540 align:start position:0%
children the sexual exploitation of our
 
00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:47.700 align:start position:0%
children began on social media postings
 
00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:49.740 align:start position:0%
text messaging and the use of cell
 
00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:50.750 align:start position:0%
text messaging and the use of cell
phones

00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
phones
 
00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:53.160 align:start position:0%
often the initial triage of these cases
 
00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
do not appear to be criminal in nature
 
00:13:58.190 --> 00:13:58.200 align:start position:0%
therefore are many many partners in law
 
00:13:59.750 --> 00:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement could not assist us in
 
00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:01.980 align:start position:0%
getting the information that we needed
 
00:14:03.889 --> 00:14:03.899 align:start position:0%
we have no tools to get this information
 
00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:06.600 align:start position:0%
because we have no subpoena Powers again
 
00:14:09.769 --> 00:14:09.779 align:start position:0%
the kids are left hanging the teachers
 
00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:13.260 align:start position:0%
accused have no support and don't have
 
00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
the information to regenerate them and
 
00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:17.820 align:start position:0%
the bad teacher has the possibility of
 
00:14:20.269 --> 00:14:20.279 align:start position:0%
slipping off the hook again this comes
 
00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:22.740 align:start position:0%
down to relationships I've created and
 
00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
creativity in the investigations
 
00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
we have all have been very lucky that
 
00:14:30.949 --> 00:14:30.959 align:start position:0%
this agency and I and school districts
 
00:14:32.569 --> 00:14:32.579 align:start position:0%
and their staff Union reps and their
 
00:14:34.129 --> 00:14:34.139 align:start position:0%
attorneys work reasonably well together
 
00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:36.600 align:start position:0%
to get the job done but the day is
 
00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:38.940 align:start position:0%
coming when this will not happen
 
00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:41.820 align:start position:0%
I amazed I'm amazed absolutely amazed
 
00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:43.860 align:start position:0%
that an investigator for oplc can
 
00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
subpoena records associated with Barbers
 
00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:49.380 align:start position:0%
cosmeticians nurses and other licensees
 
00:14:52.009 --> 00:14:52.019 align:start position:0%
and the Department of Education will
 
00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:54.180 align:start position:0%
oversee the safety of children do not
 
00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:55.740 align:start position:0%
have that Authority
 
00:14:58.069 --> 00:14:58.079 align:start position:0%
it's 2023
 
00:15:00.889 --> 00:15:00.899 align:start position:0%
our children should be protected and
 
00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:03.660 align:start position:0%
subpoena power will allow us to do that
 
00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:05.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very much if you have any
 
00:15:07.189 --> 00:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
questions questions for this for either
 
00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:08.760 align:start position:0%
of these Witnesses
 
00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:11.220 align:start position:0%
yes representative Perez thank you
 
00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:13.380 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question will this
 
00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:14.389 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question will this
cover

00:15:14.389 --> 00:15:14.399 align:start position:0%
cover
 
00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:18.120 align:start position:0%
all School Employees for example will it
 
00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
cover the uh the principles the
 
00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:23.389 align:start position:0%
cover the uh the principles the
custodians

00:15:23.389 --> 00:15:23.399 align:start position:0%
custodians
 
00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:27.240 align:start position:0%
um or is it just Educators so for for my
 
00:15:29.329 --> 00:15:29.339 align:start position:0%
purposes as educated misconduct it's for
 
00:15:31.009 --> 00:15:31.019 align:start position:0%
license holders so that would be
 
00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:31.940 align:start position:0%
superintendents assistant
 
00:15:33.769 --> 00:15:33.779 align:start position:0%
superintendents principals
 
00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
administrators teachers
 
00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
paraprofessionals that hold licenses
 
00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:39.420 align:start position:0%
all right other questions for this
 
00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:40.790 align:start position:0%
all right other questions for this
Witness

00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
Witness
 
00:15:42.829 --> 00:15:42.839 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you oh I'm sorry
 
00:15:44.389 --> 00:15:44.399 align:start position:0%
representative Brennan
 
00:15:46.189 --> 00:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:48.060 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:15:50.889 --> 00:15:50.899 align:start position:0%
um earlier in your testimony you stated
 
00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:54.420 align:start position:0%
that one percent of teachers do not
 
00:15:56.449 --> 00:15:56.459 align:start position:0%
share the common goal of keeping our
 
00:15:58.910 --> 00:15:58.920 align:start position:0%
children safe and I'm wondering if you
 
00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
might be able to provide the source for
 
00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
that number I'd be happy to give you the
 
00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:07.500 align:start position:0%
the list of suspended revoked Educators
 
00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:09.240 align:start position:0%
that we've compiled
 
00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:12.300 align:start position:0%
um we can do it by uh year we can do it
 
00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
by alphabetical order but it's a small
 
00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:17.880 align:start position:0%
percentage of people that have engaged
 
00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:19.860 align:start position:0%
in misconduct that have put Children at
 
00:16:21.829 --> 00:16:21.839 align:start position:0%
Risk and that's the one percent I'm
 
00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:30.060 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire Educators or is that a
 
00:16:32.509 --> 00:16:32.519 align:start position:0%
nationwide figure that'd be New
 
00:16:34.189 --> 00:16:34.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I don't have any
 
00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:36.300 align:start position:0%
facts or figures to support any other
 
00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:39.060 align:start position:0%
state but the one that I work in
 
00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:45.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:47.509 --> 00:16:47.519 align:start position:0%
sir could you tell me what the
 
00:16:50.509 --> 00:16:50.519 align:start position:0%
significance of your Irish heritage has
 
00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:54.360 align:start position:0%
to do with this bill oh it's a a kind of
 
00:16:57.170 --> 00:16:57.180 align:start position:0%
like a little bit of Blarney that I have
 
00:17:00.769 --> 00:17:00.779 align:start position:0%
it's nice to be able to communicate with
 
00:17:00.779 --> 00:17:03.110 align:start position:0%
it's nice to be able to communicate with
uh

00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:07.020 align:start position:0%
create relationships get people to trust
 
00:17:10.189 --> 00:17:10.199 align:start position:0%
that I'm not working opposed to their
 
00:17:10.199 --> 00:17:11.750 align:start position:0%
that I'm not working opposed to their
position

00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
position
 
00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:13.500 align:start position:0%
um it's it's
 
00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:14.630 align:start position:0%
um it's it's
um

00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:14.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's either easier to convince
 
00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:19.740 align:start position:0%
people to be on your team than trying to
 
00:17:22.850 --> 00:17:22.860 align:start position:0%
pound them over the head thank you
 
00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:25.260 align:start position:0%
representative page yeah thanks for
 
00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:28.980 align:start position:0%
taking my question top of the morning
 
00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:30.409 align:start position:0%
taking my question top of the morning
um

00:17:30.409 --> 00:17:30.419 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:33.720 align:start position:0%
so the just I want to have a question in
 
00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:35.580 align:start position:0%
terms of what you defined you said the
 
00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:37.260 align:start position:0%
license holders would come under the
 
00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:39.660 align:start position:0%
purview of this subpoena power right so
 
00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:42.720 align:start position:0%
if I have a license to teach or
 
00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:45.240 align:start position:0%
administrate or whatever a neighbor does
 
00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:47.820 align:start position:0%
that the department would have that
 
00:17:50.810 --> 00:17:50.820 align:start position:0%
authority over that person
 
00:17:52.909 --> 00:17:52.919 align:start position:0%
wherever they may be
 
00:17:55.490 --> 00:17:55.500 align:start position:0%
and I'm gonna assist on this question I
 
00:17:56.690 --> 00:17:56.700 align:start position:0%
just could he answer that question
 
00:17:59.510 --> 00:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
though I I think he he mentioned that I
 
00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
want to understand he's doing the
 
00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:02.280 align:start position:0%
investigation that's why he's here right
 
00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:04.620 align:start position:0%
he certainly is yeah
 
00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:06.230 align:start position:0%
he certainly is yeah
so

00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:10.200 align:start position:0%
the code of conduct is the method that
 
00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
we uh that we use to conduct
 
00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:15.240 align:start position:0%
investigations and the code of conduct
 
00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:17.700 align:start position:0%
is very limited in its scope and the
 
00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:20.700 align:start position:0%
scope is a license holder so for example
 
00:18:24.289 --> 00:18:24.299 align:start position:0%
we cannot go in and examine a custodian
 
00:18:27.289 --> 00:18:27.299 align:start position:0%
a kitchen staffer a secretary because
 
00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:29.100 align:start position:0%
they don't hold licenses with the
 
00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
Department of Education so my
 
00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:32.700 align:start position:0%
investigations in the code of conduct is
 
00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:34.980 align:start position:0%
limited to those persons who hold
 
00:18:37.909 --> 00:18:37.919 align:start position:0%
licenses that we control anybody else in
 
00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:39.080 align:start position:0%
the school district
 
00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:43.020 align:start position:0%
any other employee we can't use the
 
00:18:45.049 --> 00:18:45.059 align:start position:0%
subpoena power for them because they're
 
00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:47.460 align:start position:0%
not licensed holders so it's limited to
 
00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
those persons that hold the license
 
00:18:52.930 --> 00:18:52.940 align:start position:0%
another question follow-up sure yeah
 
00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:55.860 align:start position:0%
changing subjects quickly it sounded
 
00:18:57.529 --> 00:18:57.539 align:start position:0%
like if I understood your testimony
 
00:18:57.539 --> 00:18:58.850 align:start position:0%
like if I understood your testimony
correctly

00:18:58.850 --> 00:18:58.860 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:02.280 align:start position:0%
you said that you're having success
 
00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:04.260 align:start position:0%
in your job right now but the day will
 
00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:05.029 align:start position:0%
in your job right now but the day will
come

00:19:05.029 --> 00:19:05.039 align:start position:0%
come
 
00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:07.260 align:start position:0%
is that what you said we're having
 
00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:08.570 align:start position:0%
is that what you said we're having
success

00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:08.580 align:start position:0%
success
 
00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:09.780 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:12.780 align:start position:0%
we are getting increasingly pushed back
 
00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:13.909 align:start position:0%
we are getting increasingly pushed back
from

00:19:13.909 --> 00:19:13.919 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:16.980 align:start position:0%
certain stakeholders that are saying no
 
00:19:18.049 --> 00:19:18.059 align:start position:0%
we're not going to provide that
 
00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:19.260 align:start position:0%
information for you I can give you
 
00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:22.500 align:start position:0%
anecdotal or I can give you definitive
 
00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:24.600 align:start position:0%
information that for example just this
 
00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
week we had a an educator that has come
 
00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:29.160 align:start position:0%
under our radar as licensed educator
 
00:19:32.529 --> 00:19:32.539 align:start position:0%
that was that uh is under investigation
 
00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:34.980 align:start position:0%
and I had to deal with three different
 
00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:37.620 align:start position:0%
superintendents to ask for assistance in
 
00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:40.020 align:start position:0%
an investigation to to determine whether
 
00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
or not misconduct may have occurred I
 
00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:44.700 align:start position:0%
got three different answers from three
 
00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:47.100 align:start position:0%
different superintendents two of which
 
00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:50.280 align:start position:0%
were great and very assisting one flat
 
00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
out said no I'm not going to give you
 
00:19:52.970 --> 00:19:52.980 align:start position:0%
that information
 
00:19:55.909 --> 00:19:55.919 align:start position:0%
and it's crucial information to
 
00:19:57.409 --> 00:19:57.419 align:start position:0%
determine whether or not educated
 
00:19:59.870 --> 00:19:59.880 align:start position:0%
misconduct occurred and any action that
 
00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
we might take regarding this educator so
 
00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:05.820 align:start position:0%
I had one case three superintendents one
 
00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:08.580 align:start position:0%
flat out said no thank you I don't have
 
00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
any authority to say to the
 
00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
superintendent no I really need this
 
00:20:13.549 --> 00:20:13.559 align:start position:0%
information please please please give me
 
00:20:15.049 --> 00:20:15.059 align:start position:0%
this information I don't have the
 
00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
authority to do it so I have three
 
00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:19.130 align:start position:0%
authority to do it so I have three
superintendents

00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:19.140 align:start position:0%
superintendents
 
00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:21.480 align:start position:0%
two had levels of cooperation one said
 
00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:22.970 align:start position:0%
two had levels of cooperation one said
no

00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:22.980 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:25.380 align:start position:0%
other questions yes representative

Greece thank you Mr chair and thank you

sir for answering our questions
 
00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
is a subpoena a first line of action or
 
00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
a last line of action for you for me
 
00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:37.140 align:start position:0%
it'd be the last line of action I would
 
00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
exhaust every other opportunity I had
 
00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:40.980 align:start position:0%
and that would be the last thing that I
 
00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
would use
 
00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:44.280 align:start position:0%

in the public schools in this state
 
00:22:04.370 --> 00:22:04.380 align:start position:0%

um
 
00:22:16.669 --> 00:22:16.679 align:start position:0%
that information whether it requires a
 
00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
subpoena or not when it comes to
 
00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
non-licensed persons I routinely have
 
00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
referred those type of cases to the
 
00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
local County attorney the local police
 
00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
and other partners that we have because
 
00:22:30.890 --> 00:22:30.900 align:start position:0%
sometimes that Behavior Uh that is in
 
00:22:33.529 --> 00:22:33.539 align:start position:0%
question may be border on criminal
 
00:22:37.010 --> 00:22:37.020 align:start position:0%
Behavior so we would immediately I
 
00:22:38.810 --> 00:22:38.820 align:start position:0%
immediately pass that on to other
 
00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
authorities we just had I think you
 
00:22:43.669 --> 00:22:43.679 align:start position:0%
probably saw the news that a bus driver
 
00:22:45.890 --> 00:22:45.900 align:start position:0%
was arrested yesterday we got that
 
00:22:47.149 --> 00:22:47.159 align:start position:0%
information from the school district
 
00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:50.100 align:start position:0%
from the superintendent almost within
 
00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:52.860 align:start position:0%
minutes after he became aware of it we
 
00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:54.780 align:start position:0%
immediately I immediately forwarded to
 
00:22:56.450 --> 00:22:56.460 align:start position:0%
the chief of police and the Hudson
 
00:22:58.669 --> 00:22:58.679 align:start position:0%
police department and they conducted a
 
00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:00.720 align:start position:0%
robust investigation that had had
 
00:23:02.810 --> 00:23:02.820 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with us but we were able
 
00:23:06.049 --> 00:23:06.059 align:start position:0%
to refer it to the right agency
 
00:23:07.850 --> 00:23:07.860 align:start position:0%

00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
um thank you for taking my question
 
00:23:14.090 --> 00:23:14.100 align:start position:0%
um so you just
 
00:23:17.149 --> 00:23:17.159 align:start position:0%
met an educator was found
 
00:23:19.330 --> 00:23:19.340 align:start position:0%
um or you're looking into investigating
 
00:23:22.810 --> 00:23:22.820 align:start position:0%
and why would you have more than one
 
00:23:25.610 --> 00:23:25.620 align:start position:0%
superintendent to
 
00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:27.740 align:start position:0%
um ask the you know to question about
 
00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:31.380 align:start position:0%
that person don't you normally just have
 
00:23:33.649 --> 00:23:33.659 align:start position:0%
one superintendent that the educator
 
00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:35.640 align:start position:0%
would be under
 
00:23:37.669 --> 00:23:37.679 align:start position:0%
in this particular case and and very
 
00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
often this is the case this involved
 
00:23:42.049 --> 00:23:42.059 align:start position:0%
three superintendents one was
 
00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
superintendent of a district at the time
 
00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:47.580 align:start position:0%
the person was initially hired the
 
00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
second superintendent was the new
 
00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:50.210 align:start position:0%
second superintendent was the new
superintendent

00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:50.220 align:start position:0%
superintendent
 
00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:53.400 align:start position:0%
who works in that same district and the
 
00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
third superintendent was a previous
 
00:23:57.890 --> 00:23:57.900 align:start position:0%
employer so we went out and asked each
 
00:23:59.810 --> 00:23:59.820 align:start position:0%
one of those superintendents to assist
 
00:24:03.370 --> 00:24:03.380 align:start position:0%
us in triaging that case
 
00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:08.570 --> 00:24:08.580 align:start position:0%
thank you very much you mentioned the
 
00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:10.140 align:start position:0%
case of the bus driver and I read about
 
00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:11.700 align:start position:0%
that in the newspaper I guess it was
 
00:24:13.669 --> 00:24:13.679 align:start position:0%
this morning or yesterday morning they
 
00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:15.480 align:start position:0%
all kind of meld together
 
00:24:17.149 --> 00:24:17.159 align:start position:0%
and actually the case of the bus driver
 
00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:18.900 align:start position:0%
bus drivers are licensed but I think
 
00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:20.280 align:start position:0%
they're to drive
 
00:24:22.250 --> 00:24:22.260 align:start position:0%
school buses but they're licensed by the
 
00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:24.360 align:start position:0%
dot but um and
 
00:24:25.909 --> 00:24:25.919 align:start position:0%
this is a little bit out of the purview
 
00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:28.140 align:start position:0%
of ours so is there a question yes it's
 
00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
going to be yes a little bit of the
 
00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:31.380 align:start position:0%
purview a question and we're going
 
00:24:33.289 --> 00:24:33.299 align:start position:0%
against the political Trend does anybody
 
00:24:34.549 --> 00:24:34.559 align:start position:0%
listen to Governor's budget address
 
00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:37.740 align:start position:0%
knows but would it make your job easier
 
00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:39.960 align:start position:0%
for a house we licensed um
 
00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:43.200 align:start position:0%
everybody who was in a child facing role
 
00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:45.240 align:start position:0%
with the schools regardless of whether
 
00:24:47.770 --> 00:24:47.780 align:start position:0%
or not they were Educators or
 
00:24:49.850 --> 00:24:49.860 align:start position:0%
paraprofessionals or just support staff
 
00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:51.409 align:start position:0%
paraprofessionals or just support staff
well

00:24:51.409 --> 00:24:51.419 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:54.120 align:start position:0%
it you know the answer is no it wouldn't
 
00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
make my job easier and I think we have
 
00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:01.200 align:start position:0%
to Define who educators are and what the
 
00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
code of conduct is so I think by
 
00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:05.340 align:start position:0%
expanding I wouldn't want to expand the
 
00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:08.580 align:start position:0%
role of this agency to be involved with
 
00:25:12.190 --> 00:25:12.200 align:start position:0%
persons that are not licensed
 
00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:14.289 align:start position:0%
persons that are not licensed
yes

00:25:14.289 --> 00:25:14.299 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:25:16.789 --> 00:25:16.799 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning I'm in a
 
00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:19.260 align:start position:0%
different place right
 
00:25:21.409 --> 00:25:21.419 align:start position:0%
no chair
 
00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:22.740 align:start position:0%
um good morning and thank you for taking
 
00:25:24.049 --> 00:25:24.059 align:start position:0%
my question
 
00:25:26.149 --> 00:25:26.159 align:start position:0%
um I think you testified that
 
00:25:28.010 --> 00:25:28.020 align:start position:0%
um you said without the subpoena power
 
00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:29.940 align:start position:0%
you would have no authority to get the
 
00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:32.220 align:start position:0%
information that you were requesting so
 
00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:36.120 align:start position:0%
what is the scope of the subpoena is it
 
00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:38.220 align:start position:0%
you can get any information you want I
 
00:25:40.549 --> 00:25:40.559 align:start position:0%
mean what's the hook for you know
 
00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:42.120 align:start position:0%
containing what information your
 
00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:44.580 align:start position:0%
subpoena power has the subpoena power
 
00:25:47.330 --> 00:25:47.340 align:start position:0%
would be limited to what I asked for uh
 
00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:49.140 align:start position:0%
so I wouldn't it it's not a phishing
 
00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
that that would go out and you know drag
 
00:25:52.789 --> 00:25:52.799 align:start position:0%
the ocean for all types of information
 
00:25:56.810 --> 00:25:56.820 align:start position:0%
it'd be specific a report for example uh
 
00:25:59.269 --> 00:25:59.279 align:start position:0%
Personnel record for example uh past
 
00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
disciplinary practices or actions
 
00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
against the educator those are the type
 
00:26:05.269 --> 00:26:05.279 align:start position:0%
of things witness statements uh we're
 
00:26:07.370 --> 00:26:07.380 align:start position:0%
not casting a wide net and trying to
 
00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
capture people in that net we want to be
 
00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:11.940 align:start position:0%
very limited and focused on the
 
00:26:14.269 --> 00:26:14.279 align:start position:0%
allegation and those things associated
 
00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:16.140 align:start position:0%
with the allegation
 
00:26:19.669 --> 00:26:19.679 align:start position:0%
yes so I think that's what I'm asking so
 
00:26:21.769 --> 00:26:21.779 align:start position:0%
you're not limited within the scope of
 
00:26:24.769 --> 00:26:24.779 align:start position:0%
whatever you want absolutely not and and
 
00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:26.340 align:start position:0%
keep in mind
 
00:26:29.570 --> 00:26:29.580 align:start position:0%
code of conduct is my guide that that's
 
00:26:32.930 --> 00:26:32.940 align:start position:0%
the my boundaries those just like uh
 
00:26:35.029 --> 00:26:35.039 align:start position:0%
when I was in the State Police there are
 
00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:37.380 align:start position:0%
certain things those um I have to stay
 
00:26:40.370 --> 00:26:40.380 align:start position:0%
within my lane and the code of conduct
 
00:26:42.890 --> 00:26:42.900 align:start position:0%
is my lane and I don't go outside that
 
00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:45.000 align:start position:0%
code of conduct I don't go outside those
 
00:26:48.649 --> 00:26:48.659 align:start position:0%
Lanes so the idea that
 
00:26:51.769 --> 00:26:51.779 align:start position:0%
you'll see if you look at
 
00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
the code of conduct you have to be very
 
00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:55.430 align:start position:0%
the code of conduct you have to be very
careful

00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
careful
 
00:26:57.529 --> 00:26:57.539 align:start position:0%
that people weaponize the code of
 
00:27:00.789 --> 00:27:00.799 align:start position:0%
conduct parents weaponize it on occasion
 
00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:04.440 align:start position:0%
school districts perhaps
 
00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:05.090 align:start position:0%
school districts perhaps
um

00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:05.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:07.500 align:start position:0%
we don't want to weaponize the code we
 
00:27:09.049 --> 00:27:09.059 align:start position:0%
want to stay within the bounds of the
 
00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
code and weaponizing it is really a bad
 
00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:13.430 align:start position:0%
code and weaponizing it is really a bad
idea

00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
idea
 
00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:15.240 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions for this
 
00:27:18.049 --> 00:27:18.059 align:start position:0%
witness yes Representatives excuse me
 
00:27:18.059 --> 00:27:20.390 align:start position:0%
witness yes Representatives excuse me
sir

00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:20.400 align:start position:0%
sir
 
00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thanks for taking
 
00:27:23.149 --> 00:27:23.159 align:start position:0%
the question
 
00:27:25.610 --> 00:27:25.620 align:start position:0%
um I I'm sort of going back to the idea
 
00:27:27.649 --> 00:27:27.659 align:start position:0%
this is a um an amendment to the
 
00:27:30.169 --> 00:27:30.179 align:start position:0%
original bill that came before us
 
00:27:32.269 --> 00:27:32.279 align:start position:0%
um and I know it's a full replacement of
 
00:27:33.409 --> 00:27:33.419 align:start position:0%
that bill
 
00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:34.860 align:start position:0%
um but I guess my question is the
 
00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
original bill
 
00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:38.700 align:start position:0%
um basically and I believe that's why
 
00:27:41.570 --> 00:27:41.580 align:start position:0%
it's before this committee um
 
00:27:45.409 --> 00:27:45.419 align:start position:0%
this uh specifically targeted complaints
 
00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
um related to student discriminary
 
00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:51.000 align:start position:0%
discriminatory practices
 
00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:52.740 align:start position:0%
um and I'm wondering
 
00:27:57.470 --> 00:27:57.480 align:start position:0%
is the request before us now sounds like
 
00:27:59.330 --> 00:27:59.340 align:start position:0%
it may be much broader than sort of
 
00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
things related to student discriminary
 
00:28:03.409 --> 00:28:03.419 align:start position:0%
discriminatory practices so I'm
 
00:28:05.570 --> 00:28:05.580 align:start position:0%
wondering how you see the the split
 
00:28:08.450 --> 00:28:08.460 align:start position:0%
between the two and whether or not this
 
00:28:10.370 --> 00:28:10.380 align:start position:0%
is actually much broader than than sort
 
00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:11.880 align:start position:0%
of what originally was put before us
 
00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:16.010 align:start position:0%
of what originally was put before us
thanks

00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:16.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:18.169 --> 00:28:18.179 align:start position:0%
different concept and the the original
 
00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:20.640 align:start position:0%
House Bill 533
 
00:28:23.570 --> 00:28:23.580 align:start position:0%
um and as I mentioned at the beginning
 
00:28:25.370 --> 00:28:25.380 align:start position:0%
of my testimony
 
00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:28.200 align:start position:0%
um Richard Farrell had been asking for
 
00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:31.020 align:start position:0%
this type of Bill uh for for quite a
 
00:28:33.409 --> 00:28:33.419 align:start position:0%
while and in working with representative
 
00:28:35.330 --> 00:28:35.340 align:start position:0%
Lynn and working with the Attorney
 
00:28:38.149 --> 00:28:38.159 align:start position:0%
General's office on the original House
 
00:28:39.710 --> 00:28:39.720 align:start position:0%
Bill 533
 
00:28:41.330 --> 00:28:41.340 align:start position:0%
um we have since worked with the AG's
 
00:28:44.090 --> 00:28:44.100 align:start position:0%
office to come up with a an sop as to
 
00:28:46.549 --> 00:28:46.559 align:start position:0%
how we transfer those cases to the Human
 
00:28:48.649 --> 00:28:48.659 align:start position:0%
Rights Commission and the AG's office it
 
00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
was brought up in that conversation kind
 
00:28:53.570 --> 00:28:53.580 align:start position:0%
of separate and apart from it that the
 
00:28:55.789 --> 00:28:55.799 align:start position:0%
department should probably seek subpoena
 
00:28:57.409 --> 00:28:57.419 align:start position:0%
power for the code of conduct
 
00:28:59.930 --> 00:28:59.940 align:start position:0%
investigations that we do and so we
 
00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:01.260 align:start position:0%
thought that this would be the
 
00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity to to do that and my
 
00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
understanding is representative Lynn has
 
00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
worked or spoken to the Attorney
 
00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
General's office about this amendment
 
00:29:10.909 --> 00:29:10.919 align:start position:0%
but obviously I will let him speak to
 
00:29:13.250 --> 00:29:13.260 align:start position:0%
that no that no that's true the the
 
00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
second the um
 
00:29:21.370 --> 00:29:21.380 align:start position:0%
the amendment uh 2023
 
00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
-0739h is slight you'll see that the
 
00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:26.220 align:start position:0%
wording of that is slightly different
 
00:29:29.149 --> 00:29:29.159 align:start position:0%
than the earlier proposed amendment and
 
00:29:31.789 --> 00:29:31.799 align:start position:0%
that change in wording reflects
 
00:29:33.649 --> 00:29:33.659 align:start position:0%
Suggestions by the Attorney General's
 
00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:36.120 align:start position:0%
office that's that's why the that's the
 
00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
slight slight change in wording okay so
 
00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
just quick follow-up so and I don't know
 
00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
whether I'm asking this of uh um the uh
 
00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
the scope then of what we're talking
 
00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
about today
 
00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
um would go beyond sort of the the
 
00:29:57.350 --> 00:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
original bill in terms of of not just
 
00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
targeting discriminatory complaints but
 
00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:03.240 align:start position:0%
targeting essentially any issue before
 
00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:04.669 align:start position:0%
targeting essentially any issue before
the

00:30:04.669 --> 00:30:04.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:30:07.250 --> 00:30:07.260 align:start position:0%
um that that comes before you
 
00:30:10.010 --> 00:30:10.020 align:start position:0%
eat the short answer to your question is
 
00:30:12.889 --> 00:30:12.899 align:start position:0%
yes it is broader but I'm going to it's
 
00:30:14.930 --> 00:30:14.940 align:start position:0%
a Nuance because it falls directly
 
00:30:16.850 --> 00:30:16.860 align:start position:0%
within the code of conduct so to
 
00:30:18.769 --> 00:30:18.779 align:start position:0%
reference back to Richard Farrell we are
 
00:30:20.330 --> 00:30:20.340 align:start position:0%
within the bounds of the code of conduct
 
00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:22.200 align:start position:0%
but it is outside
 
00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
um of the discriminatory practices yes
 
00:30:26.389 --> 00:30:26.399 align:start position:0%
other questions for the yes
 
00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:28.140 align:start position:0%
representative Payne about Paige I'm
 
00:30:31.669 --> 00:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
sorry that could be true
 
00:30:34.909 --> 00:30:34.919 align:start position:0%
um so I'm just trying an off uh bouncing
 
00:30:36.289 --> 00:30:36.299 align:start position:0%
a little bit off of Representative
 
00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
tourist question on the timeline and I'm
 
00:30:40.010 --> 00:30:40.020 align:start position:0%
trying to catch up from the original
 
00:30:42.169 --> 00:30:42.179 align:start position:0%
Bill to the Amendments we have with the
 
00:30:45.649 --> 00:30:45.659 align:start position:0%
subpoena issue here before us but if I'm
 
00:30:47.690 --> 00:30:47.700 align:start position:0%
understanding this correctly
 
00:30:49.789 --> 00:30:49.799 align:start position:0%
Mr Farrell's been working at the
 
00:30:51.889 --> 00:30:51.899 align:start position:0%
Department of Education for about 10
 
00:30:51.899 --> 00:30:52.970 align:start position:0%
Department of Education for about 10
years

00:30:52.970 --> 00:30:52.980 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:30:57.590 --> 00:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
2018 is when the code of conduct has was
 
00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
passed or adopted however we want to
 
00:31:01.190 --> 00:31:01.200 align:start position:0%
phrase that
 
00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:04.740 align:start position:0%
and now it's 2023 but Mr Farrell's been
 
00:31:06.889 --> 00:31:06.899 align:start position:0%
asking for The subpoena power for as
 
00:31:09.889 --> 00:31:09.899 align:start position:0%
long as he's been employed there
 
00:31:11.810 --> 00:31:11.820 align:start position:0%
is this the first time the Department's
 
00:31:13.789 --> 00:31:13.799 align:start position:0%
asked this is a yes or no is this the
 
00:31:15.230 --> 00:31:15.240 align:start position:0%
first time the Department's asked for
 
00:31:18.529 --> 00:31:18.539 align:start position:0%
subpoena power yes
 
00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
other other questions for this Witness
 
00:31:24.049 --> 00:31:24.059 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much
 
00:31:26.810 --> 00:31:26.820 align:start position:0%
um next I'm going to call on uh Barrett
 
00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:37.669 align:start position:0%
um next I'm going to call on uh Barrett
Christina

00:31:37.669 --> 00:31:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
good morning uh chairman Lynn good
 
00:31:41.330 --> 00:31:41.340 align:start position:0%
morning members of the committee Barrett
 
00:31:43.130 --> 00:31:43.140 align:start position:0%
Christina from the New Hampshire school
 
00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
boards Association as we were opposed
 
00:31:46.490 --> 00:31:46.500 align:start position:0%
with the original Bill were opposed to
 
00:31:48.409 --> 00:31:48.419 align:start position:0%
the amendment as well too I'm going to
 
00:31:50.269 --> 00:31:50.279 align:start position:0%
get as many words in as I can in two
 
00:31:50.279 --> 00:31:51.289 align:start position:0%
get as many words in as I can in two
minutes

00:31:51.289 --> 00:31:51.299 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
00:31:53.330 --> 00:31:53.340 align:start position:0%
um as the conversation just went nhsba
 
00:31:55.130 --> 00:31:55.140 align:start position:0%
would argue that um this amendment is
 
00:31:57.470 --> 00:31:57.480 align:start position:0%
not germane to the original Bill the
 
00:31:59.330 --> 00:31:59.340 align:start position:0%
first bill dealt with the um human
 
00:32:01.490 --> 00:32:01.500 align:start position:0%
rights complaints um the Department of
 
00:32:02.930 --> 00:32:02.940 align:start position:0%
Education this one is a completely
 
00:32:05.330 --> 00:32:05.340 align:start position:0%
different topic under the teacher code
 
00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
of conduct completely different statute
 
00:32:09.649 --> 00:32:09.659 align:start position:0%
we don't think it's Germaine
 
00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:11.640 align:start position:0%
um second according to the Department of
 
00:32:13.909 --> 00:32:13.919 align:start position:0%
Education website 12 Educators have lost
 
00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
their license in 2022 nine in 2021 the
 
00:32:20.330 --> 00:32:20.340 align:start position:0%
system seems to be working while it may
 
00:32:22.730 --> 00:32:22.740 align:start position:0%
not always be easy the process is
 
00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:24.240 align:start position:0%
working and we're getting bad teachers
 
00:32:26.029 --> 00:32:26.039 align:start position:0%
out of out of the buildings and taking
 
00:32:28.130 --> 00:32:28.140 align:start position:0%
their licenses
 
00:32:29.930 --> 00:32:29.940 align:start position:0%
um third and perhaps most importantly
 
00:32:31.549 --> 00:32:31.559 align:start position:0%
NHS believe
 
00:32:33.169 --> 00:32:33.179 align:start position:0%
um believes that this um has the
 
00:32:35.450 --> 00:32:35.460 align:start position:0%
potential to be an infringement on
 
00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
parental rights
 
00:32:39.289 --> 00:32:39.299 align:start position:0%
um as the as the the proposed amendment
 
00:32:41.810 --> 00:32:41.820 align:start position:0%
says any person can be subpoenaed there
 
00:32:44.930 --> 00:32:44.940 align:start position:0%
are no guard rails for children
 
00:32:47.510 --> 00:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
um in the bill with the subpoena power
 
00:32:50.029 --> 00:32:50.039 align:start position:0%
um does the department have to notify
 
00:32:52.130 --> 00:32:52.140 align:start position:0%
parents um if a student is going to be
 
00:32:54.130 --> 00:32:54.140 align:start position:0%
or if a child is going to be subpoenaed
 
00:32:56.690 --> 00:32:56.700 align:start position:0%
and hypothetically if I were a parent
 
00:32:58.130 --> 00:32:58.140 align:start position:0%
and I got a subpoena from the Department
 
00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
of Education I'd probably tell them to
 
00:33:01.669 --> 00:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
pound sand
 
00:33:04.250 --> 00:33:04.260 align:start position:0%
um before I just let my kid be subject
 
00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
to to to to to some sort of
 
00:33:10.490 --> 00:33:10.500 align:start position:0%
Investigation again no guard rails for
 
00:33:13.070 --> 00:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
for students the other aspect too that
 
00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
we need to be mindful of there was a lot
 
00:33:16.789 --> 00:33:16.799 align:start position:0%
of talk about student safety relative to
 
00:33:18.529 --> 00:33:18.539 align:start position:0%
the code of conduct the teacher code of
 
00:33:19.730 --> 00:33:19.740 align:start position:0%
conduct and while that's absolutely
 
00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:21.350 align:start position:0%
conduct and while that's absolutely
Paramount

00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
Paramount
 
00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
um the the code of conduct is much
 
00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:25.070 align:start position:0%
um the the code of conduct is much
broader

00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:25.080 align:start position:0%
broader
 
00:33:27.289 --> 00:33:27.299 align:start position:0%
um than than just student safety there
 
00:33:29.090 --> 00:33:29.100 align:start position:0%
things personal behaviors that could be
 
00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
done on a weekend that have no bearing
 
00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:33.480 align:start position:0%
on children that could be a violation of
 
00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
the code of conduct so is this relative
 
00:33:38.570 --> 00:33:38.580 align:start position:0%
to student safety and obviously to some
 
00:33:40.789 --> 00:33:40.799 align:start position:0%
degree but the broader aspect is that
 
00:33:43.610 --> 00:33:43.620 align:start position:0%
it's part of of the the teacher code of
 
00:33:46.549 --> 00:33:46.559 align:start position:0%
conduct so um those I think are the
 
00:33:49.370 --> 00:33:49.380 align:start position:0%
primary aspects nhsba has for opposing
 
00:33:51.289 --> 00:33:51.299 align:start position:0%
for opposing this particular Amendment
 
00:33:52.610 --> 00:33:52.620 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to answer any questions
 
00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
and I hope I've got it under my two
 
00:33:55.610 --> 00:33:55.620 align:start position:0%
minutes question you I think you have
 
00:33:56.509 --> 00:33:56.519 align:start position:0%
questions for this witness
 
00:33:58.070 --> 00:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
 
00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:00.480 align:start position:0%
uh thank you very much
 
00:34:02.509 --> 00:34:02.519 align:start position:0%
um miss defense said something that
 
00:34:07.250 --> 00:34:07.260 align:start position:0%
shocked me uh and he said that about one
 
00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:08.450 align:start position:0%
shocked me uh and he said that about one
percent

00:34:08.450 --> 00:34:08.460 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
of the uh the people I don't want to say
 
00:34:13.609 --> 00:34:13.619 align:start position:0%
teachers the people covered lie the
 
00:34:15.589 --> 00:34:15.599 align:start position:0%
licensed professionals
 
00:34:17.629 --> 00:34:17.639 align:start position:0%
um are
 
00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:19.560 align:start position:0%
again I'll use the word suspect that's
 
00:34:21.349 --> 00:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
not a I'm not a lawyer so it's not the
 
00:34:23.990 --> 00:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
legal term and that shocked me one
 
00:34:27.950 --> 00:34:27.960 align:start position:0%
percent to me sounds very very high do
 
00:34:30.669 --> 00:34:30.679 align:start position:0%
you have any indication
 
00:34:33.589 --> 00:34:33.599 align:start position:0%
based on the information that you have
 
00:34:36.909 --> 00:34:36.919 align:start position:0%
access to that one out of every 100
 
00:34:38.930 --> 00:34:38.940 align:start position:0%
Professionals in the New Hampshire
 
00:34:42.770 --> 00:34:42.780 align:start position:0%
education system it should be removed
 
00:34:44.270 --> 00:34:44.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question uh
 
00:34:45.349 --> 00:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
representative I don't have any
 
00:34:47.570 --> 00:34:47.580 align:start position:0%
particular data relative to that
 
00:34:49.669 --> 00:34:49.679 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions for this
 
00:34:49.679 --> 00:34:51.589 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions for this
Witness

00:34:51.589 --> 00:34:51.599 align:start position:0%
Witness
 
00:34:53.389 --> 00:34:53.399 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
00:34:57.770 --> 00:34:57.780 align:start position:0%
you next going to call on Megan Tuttle
 
00:34:57.780 --> 00:35:13.609 align:start position:0%
you next going to call on Megan Tuttle
okay

00:35:13.609 --> 00:35:13.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:15.589 --> 00:35:15.599 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman members of the
 
00:35:17.450 --> 00:35:17.460 align:start position:0%
host Judiciary Committee for the record
 
00:35:19.490 --> 00:35:19.500 align:start position:0%
my name is Megan Tuttle president of Nea
 
00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:21.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we represent over 17 000
 
00:35:23.450 --> 00:35:23.460 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Educators in our K-12
 
00:35:25.069 --> 00:35:25.079 align:start position:0%
public schools and in higher education
 
00:35:27.290 --> 00:35:27.300 align:start position:0%
I'm here today and to testify an
 
00:35:29.089 --> 00:35:29.099 align:start position:0%
opposition to the non-germain amendment
 
00:35:31.490 --> 00:35:31.500 align:start position:0%
to House Bill 533
 
00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
the amendment before you we feel is
 
00:35:34.849 --> 00:35:34.859 align:start position:0%
unnecessary and unwarranted we're not
 
00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:36.720 align:start position:0%
aware of any material the doe has asked
 
00:35:38.569 --> 00:35:38.579 align:start position:0%
for in the course of an investigation
 
00:35:40.609 --> 00:35:40.619 align:start position:0%
under the code of conduct that they have
 
00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:42.720 align:start position:0%
not received so asking for this added
 
00:35:44.930 --> 00:35:44.940 align:start position:0%
power is important for them to concrete
 
00:35:46.730 --> 00:35:46.740 align:start position:0%
in asking for this power it's important
 
00:35:48.829 --> 00:35:48.839 align:start position:0%
for them to concretely articulate why it
 
00:35:51.050 --> 00:35:51.060 align:start position:0%
is they need this new ability to date we
 
00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:52.440 align:start position:0%
haven't heard this Justified we're
 
00:35:54.109 --> 00:35:54.119 align:start position:0%
hoping to hear more justification about
 
00:35:55.069 --> 00:35:55.079 align:start position:0%
it today
 
00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:56.640 align:start position:0%
we feel the legislature should be
 
00:35:58.430 --> 00:35:58.440 align:start position:0%
cautious on why agencies Beyond law
 
00:36:00.530 --> 00:36:00.540 align:start position:0%
enforcement should hold such power if
 
00:36:01.849 --> 00:36:01.859 align:start position:0%
the department at some point needs to
 
00:36:03.589 --> 00:36:03.599 align:start position:0%
issue a subpoena there's no reason they
 
00:36:04.970 --> 00:36:04.980 align:start position:0%
cannot go to the Department of Justice
 
00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
if truly if they truly needed access to
 
00:36:09.650 --> 00:36:09.660 align:start position:0%
some sort of material the department
 
00:36:12.410 --> 00:36:12.420 align:start position:0%
always has access to 91a at its disposal
 
00:36:14.329 --> 00:36:14.339 align:start position:0%
which is very Broad in its application
 
00:36:16.250 --> 00:36:16.260 align:start position:0%
for public documents
 
00:36:17.810 --> 00:36:17.820 align:start position:0%
my second point is we're very concerned
 
00:36:19.130 --> 00:36:19.140 align:start position:0%
that this amendment would apply to the
 
00:36:21.109 --> 00:36:21.119 align:start position:0%
preliminary stage of an investigation
 
00:36:23.690 --> 00:36:23.700 align:start position:0%
rather than when a formal
 
00:36:25.210 --> 00:36:25.220 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry
 
00:36:28.609 --> 00:36:28.619 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry yes and I had two minutes I I
 
00:36:30.410 --> 00:36:30.420 align:start position:0%
will slow down I apologize
 
00:36:32.450 --> 00:36:32.460 align:start position:0%
so my second point is we're very
 
00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:34.680 align:start position:0%
concerned that this amendment would
 
00:36:37.069 --> 00:36:37.079 align:start position:0%
apply to the preliminary stage of an
 
00:36:39.530 --> 00:36:39.540 align:start position:0%
investigation rather than when a formal
 
00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
complaint is launched under RSA 354a
 
00:36:45.349 --> 00:36:45.359 align:start position:0%
which operationally has been conducted
 
00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
by the Human Rights Commission or the
 
00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice the ability to
 
00:36:51.710 --> 00:36:51.720 align:start position:0%
have subpoena power this early in a
 
00:36:54.349 --> 00:36:54.359 align:start position:0%
process does have us concerned that this
 
00:36:55.790 --> 00:36:55.800 align:start position:0%
tool would be used for phishing
 
00:36:58.490 --> 00:36:58.500 align:start position:0%
Expedition for the band Concepts issues
 
00:37:00.770 --> 00:37:00.780 align:start position:0%
as recent as this Sunday on close-up
 
00:37:03.109 --> 00:37:03.119 align:start position:0%
when asked whether the doe should have
 
00:37:05.690 --> 00:37:05.700 align:start position:0%
subpoena power Ryan Terrell the State
 
00:37:07.970 --> 00:37:07.980 align:start position:0%
Board of Education member cited reasons
 
00:37:10.310 --> 00:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
of curriculum concerns as to why this is
 
00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
needed that gives us added concern as
 
00:37:14.990 --> 00:37:15.000 align:start position:0%
the motivation for asking for such a
 
00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:15.710 align:start position:0%
the motivation for asking for such a
power

00:37:15.710 --> 00:37:15.720 align:start position:0%
power
 
00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:17.640 align:start position:0%
this is yet another reason to require
 
00:37:20.750 --> 00:37:20.760 align:start position:0%
the doe to ask the doj for subpoena if
 
00:37:21.890 --> 00:37:21.900 align:start position:0%
they should need it
 
00:37:23.390 --> 00:37:23.400 align:start position:0%
we're really wondering is this really
 
00:37:25.730 --> 00:37:25.740 align:start position:0%
just for children's safety or any
 
00:37:27.650 --> 00:37:27.660 align:start position:0%
concern that somebody has against an
 
00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:28.730 align:start position:0%
concern that somebody has against an
educator

00:37:28.730 --> 00:37:28.740 align:start position:0%
educator
 
00:37:30.829 --> 00:37:30.839 align:start position:0%
who would be the decision maker of when
 
00:37:33.410 --> 00:37:33.420 align:start position:0%
a subpoena is necessary
 
00:37:35.390 --> 00:37:35.400 align:start position:0%
you may have heard that this is similar
 
00:37:37.250 --> 00:37:37.260 align:start position:0%
language afforded which we did here to
 
00:37:39.109 --> 00:37:39.119 align:start position:0%
the office of professional licensure and
 
00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
so why not have it for the doe as well
 
00:37:43.010 --> 00:37:43.020 align:start position:0%
we don't believe the two agencies are
 
00:37:45.170 --> 00:37:45.180 align:start position:0%
similar bodies simply because they both
 
00:37:47.089 --> 00:37:47.099 align:start position:0%
supervise licenses
 
00:37:49.250 --> 00:37:49.260 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education handles and
 
00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
has laws that apply to it that are far
 
00:37:53.329 --> 00:37:53.339 align:start position:0%
different more public and frankly more
 
00:37:55.069 --> 00:37:55.079 align:start position:0%
political than the boards under that
 
00:37:56.690 --> 00:37:56.700 align:start position:0%
umbrella agency
 
00:37:58.790 --> 00:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
the doe has a commissioner who is a
 
00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:00.720 align:start position:0%
political appointee and of the governor
 
00:38:02.930 --> 00:38:02.940 align:start position:0%
and the qualification for the State
 
00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
Board of Education members do not
 
00:38:08.089 --> 00:38:08.099 align:start position:0%
require as many of the oplc boards do
 
00:38:10.730 --> 00:38:10.740 align:start position:0%
that its members be Educators within the
 
00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:12.109 align:start position:0%
that its members be Educators within the
profession

00:38:12.109 --> 00:38:12.119 align:start position:0%
profession
 
00:38:14.210 --> 00:38:14.220 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time I know this was
 
00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:15.109 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time I know this was
quick

00:38:15.109 --> 00:38:15.119 align:start position:0%
quick
 
00:38:16.910 --> 00:38:16.920 align:start position:0%
um and hearing our opposition to the
 
00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:18.290 align:start position:0%
um and hearing our opposition to the
legislation

00:38:18.290 --> 00:38:18.300 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
questions for this witness or either of
 
00:38:22.910 --> 00:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:25.020 align:start position:0%
yeah uh yes representative Macbeth thank
 
00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:25.849 align:start position:0%
yeah uh yes representative Macbeth thank
you

00:38:25.849 --> 00:38:25.859 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:38:28.130 --> 00:38:28.140 align:start position:0%
um thank you for your testimony I was
 
00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
interested in the different in the board
 
00:38:33.050 --> 00:38:33.060 align:start position:0%
the licensing board uh do any of the
 
00:38:35.210 --> 00:38:35.220 align:start position:0%
license board have a code of conduct for
 
00:38:36.890 --> 00:38:36.900 align:start position:0%
their licensing do you know that's as
 
00:38:39.109 --> 00:38:39.119 align:start position:0%
broad as what teachers would be under a
 
00:38:40.010 --> 00:38:40.020 align:start position:0%
license under the Department of
 
00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:41.089 align:start position:0%
license under the Department of
Education

00:38:41.089 --> 00:38:41.099 align:start position:0%
Education
 
00:38:43.310 --> 00:38:43.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I do not know
 
00:38:44.270 --> 00:38:44.280 align:start position:0%
of any
 
00:38:45.829 --> 00:38:45.839 align:start position:0%
um Brian Hawkins might
 
00:38:47.810 --> 00:38:47.820 align:start position:0%
sure and I'll fill out a pin card Mr
 
00:38:50.510 --> 00:38:50.520 align:start position:0%
chairman I didn't have one originally
 
00:38:52.010 --> 00:38:52.020 align:start position:0%
um yes I'm sorry can you order can you
 
00:38:54.050 --> 00:38:54.060 align:start position:0%
just identify yourself for the record
 
00:38:56.089 --> 00:38:56.099 align:start position:0%
Ryan Hawkins I think you're with uh
 
00:38:57.950 --> 00:38:57.960 align:start position:0%
president Tuttle
 
00:39:01.609 --> 00:39:01.619 align:start position:0%
um uh I am only familiar with the the
 
00:39:04.490 --> 00:39:04.500 align:start position:0%
code the code of conduct under the
 
00:39:06.890 --> 00:39:06.900 align:start position:0%
Department of Education there there are
 
00:39:09.650 --> 00:39:09.660 align:start position:0%
certainly guidelines under uh those
 
00:39:11.870 --> 00:39:11.880 align:start position:0%
other boards uh but I wouldn't
 
00:39:14.270 --> 00:39:14.280 align:start position:0%
be able to cite what all of those are
 
00:39:16.069 --> 00:39:16.079 align:start position:0%
all right other questions for this
 
00:39:16.079 --> 00:39:17.450 align:start position:0%
all right other questions for this
Witness

00:39:17.450 --> 00:39:17.460 align:start position:0%
Witness
 
00:39:20.089 --> 00:39:20.099 align:start position:0%
yes representative greeson thank you Mr
 
00:39:21.410 --> 00:39:21.420 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for your testimony
 
00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
you said that you were concerned that
 
00:39:24.890 --> 00:39:24.900 align:start position:0%
these subpoenas might be used for a
 
00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
fishing Expedition for banned Concepts
 
00:39:29.030 --> 00:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
if something is prohibited from being
 
00:39:30.770 --> 00:39:30.780 align:start position:0%
taught and yet a teacher teaches it is
 
00:39:32.930 --> 00:39:32.940 align:start position:0%
that not then a violation of the code of
 
00:39:34.849 --> 00:39:34.859 align:start position:0%
conduct and therefore worthy of an
 
00:39:34.859 --> 00:39:37.730 align:start position:0%
conduct and therefore worthy of an
investigation

00:39:37.730 --> 00:39:37.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:41.210 --> 00:39:41.220 align:start position:0%
sure so so uh currently on under the
 
00:39:43.010 --> 00:39:43.020 align:start position:0%
band concept A lot of the operational
 
00:39:48.589 --> 00:39:48.599 align:start position:0%
procedure for uh a a a in when a
 
00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:51.480 align:start position:0%
complaint is filed that is under the uh
 
00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
the under the Human Rights Commission so
 
00:39:56.569 --> 00:39:56.579 align:start position:0%
it it is not under the Department of
 
00:39:58.550 --> 00:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
Education Department of Education only
 
00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
comes in with the licensure when the
 
00:40:02.690 --> 00:40:02.700 align:start position:0%
Human Rights Commission has determined
 
00:40:08.270 --> 00:40:08.280 align:start position:0%
it to be a violation of 354a
 
00:40:09.950 --> 00:40:09.960 align:start position:0%
yes but that's operationally
 
00:40:12.349 --> 00:40:12.359 align:start position:0%
representative Brenner thank you and
 
00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:14.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
00:40:17.870 --> 00:40:17.880 align:start position:0%
um the two previous people who have
 
00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
testified were unable to provide us with
 
00:40:23.750 --> 00:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
some figures regarding this claim of one
 
00:40:27.050 --> 00:40:27.060 align:start position:0%
percent of Educators not sharing the
 
00:40:28.970 --> 00:40:28.980 align:start position:0%
common goal of the safety of our
 
00:40:30.829 --> 00:40:30.839 align:start position:0%
children and I'm wondering if you might
 
00:40:32.510 --> 00:40:32.520 align:start position:0%
be able to provide us with some
 
00:40:35.870 --> 00:40:35.880 align:start position:0%
information about how many Educators
 
00:40:38.510 --> 00:40:38.520 align:start position:0%
there are in New Hampshire and perhaps
 
00:40:41.210 --> 00:40:41.220 align:start position:0%
what that one percent figure might look
 
00:40:41.220 --> 00:40:43.550 align:start position:0%
what that one percent figure might look
like

00:40:43.550 --> 00:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:44.750 align:start position:0%
 
anyway

00:40:44.750 --> 00:40:44.760 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
00:40:47.390 --> 00:40:47.400 align:start position:0%
well I I there there were some numbers
 
00:40:51.589 --> 00:40:51.599 align:start position:0%
that uh Mr Christina who preceded us uh
 
00:40:53.930 --> 00:40:53.940 align:start position:0%
referenced with respect to uh licensure
 
00:40:56.690 --> 00:40:56.700 align:start position:0%
uh uh revocation and
 
00:40:56.700 --> 00:40:57.230 align:start position:0%
uh uh revocation and
um

00:40:57.230 --> 00:40:57.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:58.910 --> 00:40:58.920 align:start position:0%
and suspensions
 
00:41:02.089 --> 00:41:02.099 align:start position:0%
um uh not today I wouldn't be able to uh
 
00:41:04.609 --> 00:41:04.619 align:start position:0%
but you know one thing I think
 
00:41:08.089 --> 00:41:08.099 align:start position:0%
um in the last uh 48 Hours we've had a
 
00:41:10.670 --> 00:41:10.680 align:start position:0%
series of bills uh that have centered
 
00:41:13.849 --> 00:41:13.859 align:start position:0%
around education and educators
 
00:41:17.390 --> 00:41:17.400 align:start position:0%
and it is uh one of the things we've
 
00:41:19.130 --> 00:41:19.140 align:start position:0%
talked we talked about frequently across
 
00:41:21.470 --> 00:41:21.480 align:start position:0%
the hall with uh chairman Ladd and the
 
00:41:23.690 --> 00:41:23.700 align:start position:0%
education committee there is you know we
 
00:41:25.310 --> 00:41:25.320 align:start position:0%
have a uh we have a shortage of
 
00:41:28.310 --> 00:41:28.320 align:start position:0%
Educators in this state and in the last
 
00:41:31.430 --> 00:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
uh 48 Hours we've had bills that have to
 
00:41:36.050 --> 00:41:36.060 align:start position:0%
that uh present uh criminal penalties
 
00:41:39.109 --> 00:41:39.119 align:start position:0%
um being litigated against individually
 
00:41:43.010 --> 00:41:43.020 align:start position:0%
over in the Senate and now a subpoena
 
00:41:46.970 --> 00:41:46.980 align:start position:0%
power bill and um so maybe not specific
 
00:41:49.430 --> 00:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
to this amendment but it is a broad
 
00:41:51.730 --> 00:41:51.740 align:start position:0%
concern the message that we're sending
 
00:41:54.349 --> 00:41:54.359 align:start position:0%
uh with some of these pieces of
 
00:41:57.829 --> 00:41:57.839 align:start position:0%
legislation because as as has been noted
 
00:42:01.130 --> 00:42:01.140 align:start position:0%
uh by both the department and uh the
 
00:42:04.190 --> 00:42:04.200 align:start position:0%
previous uh testimony
 
00:42:07.310 --> 00:42:07.320 align:start position:0%
uh the vast oh
 
00:42:09.650 --> 00:42:09.660 align:start position:0%
so many of our Educators their number
 
00:42:12.410 --> 00:42:12.420 align:start position:0%
one concern are their students and their
 
00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:13.849 align:start position:0%
one concern are their students and their
children

00:42:13.849 --> 00:42:13.859 align:start position:0%
children
 
00:42:17.930 --> 00:42:17.940 align:start position:0%
um Megan is a as an is is an actual
 
00:42:21.349 --> 00:42:21.359 align:start position:0%
educator so I can I'll for her defer to
 
00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:23.640 align:start position:0%
her on that but so it is distressing to
 
00:42:26.990 --> 00:42:27.000 align:start position:0%
hear uh particularly in light of the
 
00:42:28.250 --> 00:42:28.260 align:start position:0%
legislation that we've been hearing over
 
00:42:29.810 --> 00:42:29.820 align:start position:0%
the last couple of days
 
00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:32.640 align:start position:0%
quick follow-up if I may yes if that's
 
00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:34.190 align:start position:0%
quick follow-up if I may yes if that's
okay

00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:34.200 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:42:36.710 --> 00:42:36.720 align:start position:0%
I'm I want to make sure that I
 
00:42:38.569 --> 00:42:38.579 align:start position:0%
understand this amendment correctly and
 
00:42:40.670 --> 00:42:40.680 align:start position:0%
what the real world impact of something
 
00:42:43.310 --> 00:42:43.320 align:start position:0%
like this would be and given the
 
00:42:46.490 --> 00:42:46.500 align:start position:0%
shortage of teachers and
 
00:42:50.630 --> 00:42:50.640 align:start position:0%
um the lack of pipeline you know that
 
00:42:52.370 --> 00:42:52.380 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in particular but of
 
00:42:54.170 --> 00:42:54.180 align:start position:0%
course across the country
 
00:42:57.530 --> 00:42:57.540 align:start position:0%
um for new teachers there are less who
 
00:43:00.470 --> 00:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
will maybe less college students who may
 
00:43:03.230 --> 00:43:03.240 align:start position:0%
be pursuing education as a career and
 
00:43:04.730 --> 00:43:04.740 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if it would be your
 
00:43:07.309 --> 00:43:07.319 align:start position:0%
testimony that something like this would
 
00:43:10.370 --> 00:43:10.380 align:start position:0%
provide a chilling effect
 
00:43:13.250 --> 00:43:13.260 align:start position:0%
um for you know possible new Educators
 
00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:16.680 align:start position:0%
or Educators who are currently serving
 
00:43:18.530 --> 00:43:18.540 align:start position:0%
our students
 
00:43:20.870 --> 00:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
um there would it be a chilling effect
 
00:43:22.849 --> 00:43:22.859 align:start position:0%
for their willingness to continue
 
00:43:25.309 --> 00:43:25.319 align:start position:0%
serving our children
 
00:43:26.930 --> 00:43:26.940 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:43:28.670 --> 00:43:28.680 align:start position:0%
um yes I I do actually think it would
 
00:43:31.010 --> 00:43:31.020 align:start position:0%
have that exact effect we do have a
 
00:43:32.270 --> 00:43:32.280 align:start position:0%
shortage of the pipeline as you
 
00:43:34.250 --> 00:43:34.260 align:start position:0%
mentioned coming in we don't have a lot
 
00:43:35.809 --> 00:43:35.819 align:start position:0%
of high school kids that are going into
 
00:43:38.990 --> 00:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
the profession of teaching the number of
 
00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
students in the pre-service college
 
00:43:44.870 --> 00:43:44.880 align:start position:0%
classes and colleges is shrinking
 
00:43:47.690 --> 00:43:47.700 align:start position:0%
um and so adding this on top of you know
 
00:43:50.990 --> 00:43:51.000 align:start position:0%
five years to get what's commonly
 
00:43:52.190 --> 00:43:52.200 align:start position:0%
referred to as tenure in New Hampshire
 
00:43:54.349 --> 00:43:54.359 align:start position:0%
which is more than any of our
 
00:43:57.530 --> 00:43:57.540 align:start position:0%
surrounding states adding it to the low
 
00:43:59.089 --> 00:43:59.099 align:start position:0%
pay the teachers are getting in New
 
00:44:00.890 --> 00:44:00.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire adding it to everything that
 
00:44:02.870 --> 00:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
Mr Hawkins was just talking about with
 
00:44:04.670 --> 00:44:04.680 align:start position:0%
bills being heard things that have been
 
00:44:06.170 --> 00:44:06.180 align:start position:0%
passed in the year in the past year or
 
00:44:08.569 --> 00:44:08.579 align:start position:0%
so this is definitely going to add I
 
00:44:10.490 --> 00:44:10.500 align:start position:0%
think a chilling effect and not really
 
00:44:12.829 --> 00:44:12.839 align:start position:0%
attract Educators to New Hampshire
 
00:44:15.050 --> 00:44:15.060 align:start position:0%
for your prior question I could answer a
 
00:44:17.030 --> 00:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
little piece of that with numbers and I
 
00:44:18.650 --> 00:44:18.660 align:start position:0%
am an 18-year social studies teacher of
 
00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:20.040 align:start position:0%
eighth grade so I was in the classroom
 
00:44:22.069 --> 00:44:22.079 align:start position:0%
for a long time I'm a parent I have kids
 
00:44:23.809 --> 00:44:23.819 align:start position:0%
of my own so all this is personal as
 
00:44:26.569 --> 00:44:26.579 align:start position:0%
well as you know professional for me
 
00:44:28.849 --> 00:44:28.859 align:start position:0%
um we represent 17 000 Educators and
 
00:44:30.770 --> 00:44:30.780 align:start position:0%
when we talk about Educators that
 
00:44:32.950 --> 00:44:32.960 align:start position:0%
includes everything from teachers to
 
00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
paraprofessionals to
 
00:44:38.150 --> 00:44:38.160 align:start position:0%
um non-licensed bus drivers Food Service
 
00:44:41.750 --> 00:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
workers Etc of those 17 000 about 14 000
 
00:44:44.210 --> 00:44:44.220 align:start position:0%
or so give or take are actual teachers
 
00:44:46.190 --> 00:44:46.200 align:start position:0%
in front of a classroom we also
 
00:44:48.470 --> 00:44:48.480 align:start position:0%
represent like I said the ESP in New
 
00:44:51.470 --> 00:44:51.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire aft also represents teachers
 
00:44:53.270 --> 00:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
and districts that we don't represent so
 
00:44:55.849 --> 00:44:55.859 align:start position:0%
they have added numbers I think the last
 
00:44:58.730 --> 00:44:58.740 align:start position:0%
figure that I heard was about 26 or 27
 
00:45:01.010 --> 00:45:01.020 align:start position:0%
000 actual teachers in New Hampshire I
 
00:45:02.329 --> 00:45:02.339 align:start position:0%
could be off on that so please don't
 
00:45:03.890 --> 00:45:03.900 align:start position:0%
quote me but it's around that number
 
00:45:06.910 --> 00:45:06.920 align:start position:0%
give or take that does not include
 
00:45:08.390 --> 00:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
paraprofessionals that might have
 
00:45:10.670 --> 00:45:10.680 align:start position:0%
licenses and and that sort of thing so
 
00:45:12.589 --> 00:45:12.599 align:start position:0%
if it helps to put a little bit of the
 
00:45:15.410 --> 00:45:15.420 align:start position:0%
number together I hope that helps father
 
00:45:17.690 --> 00:45:17.700 align:start position:0%
just on those numbers if I may please
 
00:45:19.250 --> 00:45:19.260 align:start position:0%
yes thank you so much I really
 
00:45:20.510 --> 00:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate it
 
00:45:24.410 --> 00:45:24.420 align:start position:0%
if we're talking about up to 27 000
 
00:45:25.910 --> 00:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
teachers in the state of New Hampshire
 
00:45:28.849 --> 00:45:28.859 align:start position:0%
one percent seems like a very large
 
00:45:31.190 --> 00:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
number of teachers who would have
 
00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:32.690 align:start position:0%
number of teachers who would have
pursued

00:45:32.690 --> 00:45:32.700 align:start position:0%
pursued
 
00:45:35.210 --> 00:45:35.220 align:start position:0%
um as you said the five-year education
 
00:45:37.970 --> 00:45:37.980 align:start position:0%
plan to get 10-year
 
00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:38.630 align:start position:0%
plan to get 10-year
um

00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:38.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:41.270 --> 00:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to wrap my mind around this
 
00:45:43.609 --> 00:45:43.619 align:start position:0%
idea of one percent
 
00:45:46.970 --> 00:45:46.980 align:start position:0%
um of 27 000 teachers who may not share
 
00:45:49.790 --> 00:45:49.800 align:start position:0%
this common goal of safety for our
 
00:45:52.609 --> 00:45:52.619 align:start position:0%
children and does that number does that
 
00:45:56.030 --> 00:45:56.040 align:start position:0%
one percent number ring true to you
 
00:45:58.370 --> 00:45:58.380 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I was a
 
00:46:00.770 --> 00:46:00.780 align:start position:0%
little shocked by it I'm not sure that
 
00:46:02.809 --> 00:46:02.819 align:start position:0%
does seem high to be honest
 
00:46:07.130 --> 00:46:07.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:08.809 --> 00:46:08.819 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question
 
00:46:08.819 --> 00:46:09.470 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question
um

00:46:09.470 --> 00:46:09.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:11.329 --> 00:46:11.339 align:start position:0%
I know in the federal rules of civil
 
00:46:14.089 --> 00:46:14.099 align:start position:0%
procedure The subpoena power is granted
 
00:46:16.730 --> 00:46:16.740 align:start position:0%
when there's uh and then there has to be
 
00:46:18.470 --> 00:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
a docket number attached I think it's
 
00:46:20.450 --> 00:46:20.460 align:start position:0%
even listed under the trial sort of
 
00:46:24.349 --> 00:46:24.359 align:start position:0%
procedure part this this proposal here
 
00:46:27.230 --> 00:46:27.240 align:start position:0%
seems to suggest that um
 
00:46:30.589 --> 00:46:30.599 align:start position:0%
subpoena could be issued at any point in
 
00:46:33.050 --> 00:46:33.060 align:start position:0%
an investigation whenever that occurs
 
00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
and I know in New Hampshire sometimes we
 
00:46:37.069 --> 00:46:37.079 align:start position:0%
do things and we're leaders and
 
00:46:39.349 --> 00:46:39.359 align:start position:0%
sometimes maybe we're not and I'm
 
00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
wondering comparatively
 
00:46:45.170 --> 00:46:45.180 align:start position:0%
are we outliers in suggesting that we
 
00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:48.720 align:start position:0%
should have the subpoena power in so in
 
00:46:51.109 --> 00:46:51.119 align:start position:0%
in the beginning or at any point in the
 
00:46:53.690 --> 00:46:53.700 align:start position:0%
process when we compare ourselves to
 
00:46:57.470 --> 00:46:57.480 align:start position:0%
other states is that making where are we
 
00:47:01.609 --> 00:47:01.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:07.200 align:start position:0%
uh I I in in in in in a quick sort of
 
00:47:09.829 --> 00:47:09.839 align:start position:0%
pull of my of some colleagues around the
 
00:47:13.730 --> 00:47:13.740 align:start position:0%
state I didn't get any similar uh
 
00:47:18.410 --> 00:47:18.420 align:start position:0%
uh equivalence uh that that to this
 
00:47:20.569 --> 00:47:20.579 align:start position:0%
proposal that were first sent to me so I
 
00:47:22.790 --> 00:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
I apologize if that's somewhat anecdotal
 
00:47:25.010 --> 00:47:25.020 align:start position:0%
and not more concrete uh with a little
 
00:47:27.349 --> 00:47:27.359 align:start position:0%
bit more time between a public hearing
 
00:47:29.630 --> 00:47:29.640 align:start position:0%
the the hearing today and I we just saw
 
00:47:32.270 --> 00:47:32.280 align:start position:0%
the the latest Amendment and the
 
00:47:34.730 --> 00:47:34.740 align:start position:0%
executive session at 10 o'clock
 
00:47:36.710 --> 00:47:36.720 align:start position:0%
um could probably get you something more
 
00:47:38.270 --> 00:47:38.280 align:start position:0%
complete but
 
00:47:39.349 --> 00:47:39.359 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if you did you want to
 
00:47:41.329 --> 00:47:41.339 align:start position:0%
edit other questions for this
 
00:47:43.790 --> 00:47:43.800 align:start position:0%
representative Horrigan
 
00:47:46.190 --> 00:47:46.200 align:start position:0%
thank you very much is it
 
00:47:48.589 --> 00:47:48.599 align:start position:0%
I was listening to the hearings uh
 
00:47:50.990 --> 00:47:51.000 align:start position:0%
yesterday on YouTube and uh well we're
 
00:47:52.490 --> 00:47:52.500 align:start position:0%
not talking about any of those bills but
 
00:47:54.950 --> 00:47:54.960 align:start position:0%
is there anything the code of conducted
 
00:47:57.230 --> 00:47:57.240 align:start position:0%
uh says it's a violation for Teacher to
 
00:47:59.210 --> 00:47:59.220 align:start position:0%
merely you know be
 
00:48:04.730 --> 00:48:04.740 align:start position:0%
openly gay or trans or lgbtq in some way
 
00:48:07.309 --> 00:48:07.319 align:start position:0%
is that no I guess I'm I'm wondering how
 
00:48:08.870 --> 00:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
is that germane to the issue that's
 
00:48:11.329 --> 00:48:11.339 align:start position:0%
before us now well it's just part of the
 
00:48:13.069 --> 00:48:13.079 align:start position:0%
general political climate that's being
 
00:48:16.849 --> 00:48:16.859 align:start position:0%
introduced in but um so yeah so yeah you
 
00:48:18.410 --> 00:48:18.420 align:start position:0%
may answer the question if you can I
 
00:48:19.609 --> 00:48:19.619 align:start position:0%
think they did yeah
 
00:48:21.349 --> 00:48:21.359 align:start position:0%
no no
 
00:48:23.210 --> 00:48:23.220 align:start position:0%

00:48:23.220 --> 00:48:24.109 align:start position:0%
all right any other questions for this

brief I know I only have uh two minutes
 
00:49:15.650 --> 00:49:15.660 align:start position:0%
uh we uh again for the record geopacinet
 
00:49:18.170 --> 00:49:18.180 align:start position:0%
legal director at the ACLU of New
 
00:49:19.849 --> 00:49:19.859 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we are opposed to the
 
00:49:19.859 --> 00:49:20.870 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we are opposed to the
amendment

00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:49:22.490 --> 00:49:22.500 align:start position:0%
um and want to just flush out three or
 
00:49:25.309 --> 00:49:25.319 align:start position:0%
four reasons why but just at the the
 
00:49:27.109 --> 00:49:27.119 align:start position:0%
outset you know I know part of the
 
00:49:29.089 --> 00:49:29.099 align:start position:0%
rationalization or justification I
 
00:49:30.770 --> 00:49:30.780 align:start position:0%
should say for this bill has been
 
00:49:32.870 --> 00:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
obviously the need to protect child
 
00:49:34.550 --> 00:49:34.560 align:start position:0%
safety I think we can all can all can
 
00:49:37.069 --> 00:49:37.079 align:start position:0%
agree how critical and important that is
 
00:49:38.870 --> 00:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
I'm a Concord resident well aware of
 
00:49:40.849 --> 00:49:40.859 align:start position:0%
what happened in Concord
 
00:49:43.430 --> 00:49:43.440 align:start position:0%
um several several years ago but I do
 
00:49:45.109 --> 00:49:45.119 align:start position:0%
want to be clear that this this bill is
 
00:49:47.630 --> 00:49:47.640 align:start position:0%
not limited to child safety right it it
 
00:49:49.550 --> 00:49:49.560 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have that type of limitation
 
00:49:51.410 --> 00:49:51.420 align:start position:0%
embedded within it and would allow
 
00:49:53.569 --> 00:49:53.579 align:start position:0%
subpoena power
 
00:49:56.089 --> 00:49:56.099 align:start position:0%
um for the entire scope of the educator
 
00:49:58.849 --> 00:49:58.859 align:start position:0%
code of conduct which goes you know far
 
00:50:01.670 --> 00:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
beyond uh oftentimes child safety so if
 
00:50:03.170 --> 00:50:03.180 align:start position:0%
you want this to be about child safety I
 
00:50:04.309 --> 00:50:04.319 align:start position:0%
mean my recommendation would be making
 
00:50:06.829 --> 00:50:06.839 align:start position:0%
about child safety narrow it and tailor
 
00:50:09.650 --> 00:50:09.660 align:start position:0%
it uh to that because the educator code
 
00:50:11.809 --> 00:50:11.819 align:start position:0%
of conduct and if anyone kind of goes
 
00:50:12.950 --> 00:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
through it you'll you'll kind of see
 
00:50:14.930 --> 00:50:14.940 align:start position:0%
that it's
 
00:50:17.270 --> 00:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
um not too dissimilar from other kind of
 
00:50:20.450 --> 00:50:20.460 align:start position:0%
professional codes but it is very broad
 
00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
right you know you can be deemed to a
 
00:50:25.510 --> 00:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
violated educative code of conduct for
 
00:50:28.790 --> 00:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
unprofessional conduct and the code goes
 
00:50:30.530 --> 00:50:30.540 align:start position:0%
on to say including but not limited to
 
00:50:32.870 --> 00:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
so it is expansive in that sense but I
 
00:50:35.210 --> 00:50:35.220 align:start position:0%
just want to flag that for the committee
 
00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
and I know also as well uh you know part
 
00:50:40.730 --> 00:50:40.740 align:start position:0%
of the justification for this amendment
 
00:50:42.770 --> 00:50:42.780 align:start position:0%
has been well this is really a different
 
00:50:44.630 --> 00:50:44.640 align:start position:0%
concept The subpoena power is
 
00:50:46.250 --> 00:50:46.260 align:start position:0%
fundamentally different from the origins
 
00:50:47.630 --> 00:50:47.640 align:start position:0%
of the original bill I do want to say
 
00:50:50.270 --> 00:50:50.280 align:start position:0%
that they are very related though
 
00:50:53.270 --> 00:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
um because this amendment would give the
 
00:50:54.890 --> 00:50:54.900 align:start position:0%
Department of Education subpoena power
 
00:50:57.290 --> 00:50:57.300 align:start position:0%
to enforce the band Concepts action
 
00:50:59.210 --> 00:50:59.220 align:start position:0%
divisive concept act or the law against
 
00:51:00.650 --> 00:51:00.660 align:start position:0%
discrimination too whatever you do
 
00:51:02.630 --> 00:51:02.640 align:start position:0%
however you want to describe it right it
 
00:51:04.370 --> 00:51:04.380 align:start position:0%
would allow for
 
00:51:06.290 --> 00:51:06.300 align:start position:0%
um subpoena power to enforce that
 
00:51:08.210 --> 00:51:08.220 align:start position:0%
statute and I think this is problematic
 
00:51:11.270 --> 00:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
given what we believe to be ambiguities
 
00:51:13.549 --> 00:51:13.559 align:start position:0%
in that act in full disclosure we have a
 
00:51:15.530 --> 00:51:15.540 align:start position:0%
pending lawsuit challenging that
 
00:51:18.650 --> 00:51:18.660 align:start position:0%
particular statute and one of the
 
00:51:20.809 --> 00:51:20.819 align:start position:0%
concerns and that we have raised in
 
00:51:23.750 --> 00:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
court about that statute is that the ACT
 
00:51:26.450 --> 00:51:26.460 align:start position:0%
gives multiple agencies through power to
 
00:51:28.490 --> 00:51:28.500 align:start position:0%
enforce it which could lead to arbitrary
 
00:51:30.650 --> 00:51:30.660 align:start position:0%
and just discriminatory decision making
 
00:51:32.690 --> 00:51:32.700 align:start position:0%
when you have both the Department of
 
00:51:34.130 --> 00:51:34.140 align:start position:0%
Education Department of Justice the
 
00:51:35.390 --> 00:51:35.400 align:start position:0%
Human Rights Commission the Department
 
00:51:37.010 --> 00:51:37.020 align:start position:0%
of Labor and the New Hampshire courts
 
00:51:41.809 --> 00:51:41.819 align:start position:0%
all involved in that degree of info of
 
00:51:43.309 --> 00:51:43.319 align:start position:0%
enforcement and what this would really
 
00:51:46.010 --> 00:51:46.020 align:start position:0%
do in expanding the does
 
00:51:48.829 --> 00:51:48.839 align:start position:0%
uh enforcement power over that law by
 
00:51:50.990 --> 00:51:51.000 align:start position:0%
virtue of subpoena power I only think it
 
00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
would continue that Prospect of leading
 
00:51:54.730 --> 00:51:54.740 align:start position:0%
to the potential for arbitrary
 
00:51:57.349 --> 00:51:57.359 align:start position:0%
indiscriminatory enforcement so that is
 
00:51:59.569 --> 00:51:59.579 align:start position:0%
to say there's a fragmented enforcement
 
00:52:01.490 --> 00:52:01.500 align:start position:0%
scheme already with the band Concepts
 
00:52:02.930 --> 00:52:02.940 align:start position:0%
law and I think this would really just
 
00:52:06.230 --> 00:52:06.240 align:start position:0%
expand that and potentially even render
 
00:52:08.030 --> 00:52:08.040 align:start position:0%
that act even more unconstitutional than
 
00:52:09.710 --> 00:52:09.720 align:start position:0%
we think it already is
 
00:52:11.809 --> 00:52:11.819 align:start position:0%
relatedly the second point I would just
 
00:52:13.609 --> 00:52:13.619 align:start position:0%
like to make is that the amendment would
 
00:52:14.870 --> 00:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
give the Department of Education
 
00:52:18.290 --> 00:52:18.300 align:start position:0%
subpoena power over certain portions of
 
00:52:21.049 --> 00:52:21.059 align:start position:0%
the educator code of conduct where the
 
00:52:22.609 --> 00:52:22.619 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice and Human Rights
 
00:52:24.470 --> 00:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
Commission already have subpoena in
 
00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:26.520 align:start position:0%
investigatory powers and that's not only
 
00:52:28.430 --> 00:52:28.440 align:start position:0%
in the context of the banned Concepts
 
00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:29.270 align:start position:0%
in the context of the banned Concepts
Act

00:52:29.270 --> 00:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
Act
 
00:52:32.150 --> 00:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
but also uh in with respect to the law
 
00:52:36.470 --> 00:52:36.480 align:start position:0%
against discrimination RSA 354 a so um I
 
00:52:38.030 --> 00:52:38.040 align:start position:0%
just wanted to flag that that it's
 
00:52:39.589 --> 00:52:39.599 align:start position:0%
really important to know that there are
 
00:52:42.170 --> 00:52:42.180 align:start position:0%
already agencies that have enforcement
 
00:52:43.609 --> 00:52:43.619 align:start position:0%
authority over that they already have
 
00:52:45.770 --> 00:52:45.780 align:start position:0%
subpoena authority over that and I think
 
00:52:48.230 --> 00:52:48.240 align:start position:0%
with respect to those Provisions it's
 
00:52:50.210 --> 00:52:50.220 align:start position:0%
really unclear to me why subpoena power
 
00:52:52.569 --> 00:52:52.579 align:start position:0%
in the hands of the doe would be
 
00:52:55.790 --> 00:52:55.800 align:start position:0%
particularly necessary
 
00:52:59.030 --> 00:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
the last point I do want to make is that
 
00:53:01.190 --> 00:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
the amendment really does contain no
 
00:53:03.710 --> 00:53:03.720 align:start position:0%
criteria for when a subpoena can be
 
00:53:06.410 --> 00:53:06.420 align:start position:0%
issued as written the amendment allows
 
00:53:08.150 --> 00:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
Department of Education to issue a
 
00:53:09.829 --> 00:53:09.839 align:start position:0%
subpoena even the absence of a formal
 
00:53:12.410 --> 00:53:12.420 align:start position:0%
written complaint
 
00:53:14.270 --> 00:53:14.280 align:start position:0%
um we don't think that the absence of
 
00:53:15.950 --> 00:53:15.960 align:start position:0%
such criteria before the issuance of a
 
00:53:17.329 --> 00:53:17.339 align:start position:0%
subpoena would be appropriate we think
 
00:53:18.950 --> 00:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
that's an important limitation in
 
00:53:20.450 --> 00:53:20.460 align:start position:0%
addition the amendment also allows
 
00:53:21.950 --> 00:53:21.960 align:start position:0%
Department to issue a subpoena in the
 
00:53:24.530 --> 00:53:24.540 align:start position:0%
absence of an investigation formerly
 
00:53:27.230 --> 00:53:27.240 align:start position:0%
being opened where the department has
 
00:53:29.270 --> 00:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
initially determined that a possible
 
00:53:31.190 --> 00:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
violation of the code of conduct has
 
00:53:32.630 --> 00:53:32.640 align:start position:0%
occurred and I think we think that is an
 
00:53:34.730 --> 00:53:34.740 align:start position:0%
important limitation as well and I I
 
00:53:37.730 --> 00:53:37.740 align:start position:0%
would also suggest and I'm not an expert
 
00:53:40.490 --> 00:53:40.500 align:start position:0%
on the oplc regime and how they operate
 
00:53:42.650 --> 00:53:42.660 align:start position:0%
but when you look at the entirety of the
 
00:53:45.410 --> 00:53:45.420 align:start position:0%
oplc statute that I believe this is
 
00:53:47.770 --> 00:53:47.780 align:start position:0%
modeled after and it's RSA
 
00:53:51.230 --> 00:53:51.240 align:start position:0%
310-a colon 1-j
 
00:53:51.240 --> 00:53:52.370 align:start position:0%
310-a colon 1-j
um

00:53:52.370 --> 00:53:52.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:55.250 --> 00:53:55.260 align:start position:0%
uh and I would maybe ask oplc to confirm
 
00:53:57.109 --> 00:53:57.119 align:start position:0%
this whether they agree disagree but it
 
00:54:00.290 --> 00:54:00.300 align:start position:0%
seems to me that a subpoena potentially
 
00:54:02.030 --> 00:54:02.040 align:start position:0%
only could be issued after an
 
00:54:03.650 --> 00:54:03.660 align:start position:0%
investigation has formally been
 
00:54:05.030 --> 00:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
conducted and I think that's an
 
00:54:06.589 --> 00:54:06.599 align:start position:0%
important limitation if my reading of
 
00:54:08.510 --> 00:54:08.520 align:start position:0%
that statute is correct but that
 
00:54:11.089 --> 00:54:11.099 align:start position:0%
limitation doesn't exist um in the
 
00:54:14.210 --> 00:54:14.220 align:start position:0%
amendment so I think if if this is a
 
00:54:15.950 --> 00:54:15.960 align:start position:0%
path that the committee wants to go down
 
00:54:17.690 --> 00:54:17.700 align:start position:0%
and again we have concerns for the
 
00:54:19.490 --> 00:54:19.500 align:start position:0%
reasons that I just previously stated I
 
00:54:21.109 --> 00:54:21.119 align:start position:0%
think these limitations are very
 
00:54:23.329 --> 00:54:23.339 align:start position:0%
important and it was referenced before
 
00:54:25.970 --> 00:54:25.980 align:start position:0%
in the litigation context you can't
 
00:54:28.010 --> 00:54:28.020 align:start position:0%
issue a subpoena until a lawsuit has
 
00:54:30.230 --> 00:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
been filed and Discovery has been
 
00:54:31.910 --> 00:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
allowed to proceed which would occur
 
00:54:33.950 --> 00:54:33.960 align:start position:0%
usually after emotion if emotion
 
00:54:36.290 --> 00:54:36.300 align:start position:0%
dismisses filed after that motion to
 
00:54:36.300 --> 00:54:37.670 align:start position:0%
dismisses filed after that motion to
dismiss

00:54:37.670 --> 00:54:37.680 align:start position:0%
dismiss
 
00:54:40.670 --> 00:54:40.680 align:start position:0%
um is is denied so important limitation
 
00:54:42.530 --> 00:54:42.540 align:start position:0%
that exists in litigation context but
 
00:54:44.630 --> 00:54:44.640 align:start position:0%
again those types of limitations are not
 
00:54:47.030 --> 00:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
necessarily spelled out here and the
 
00:54:48.710 --> 00:54:48.720 align:start position:0%
last thing I would note and I know that
 
00:54:49.790 --> 00:54:49.800 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education
 
00:54:52.190 --> 00:54:52.200 align:start position:0%
investigators said that you know he
 
00:54:52.200 --> 00:54:53.030 align:start position:0%
investigators said that you know he
um

00:54:53.030 --> 00:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:55.190 --> 00:54:55.200 align:start position:0%
he would use the subpoena power as the
 
00:54:57.950 --> 00:54:57.960 align:start position:0%
last line and I no reason to dispute
 
00:54:59.510 --> 00:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
that at all but I've been kind of doing
 
00:55:01.069 --> 00:55:01.079 align:start position:0%
this job long enough
 
00:55:02.630 --> 00:55:02.640 align:start position:0%
to know when you have broad provisions
 
00:55:04.849 --> 00:55:04.859 align:start position:0%
of power without limitations it could
 
00:55:06.829 --> 00:55:06.839 align:start position:0%
create issues down the line so I would
 
00:55:10.250 --> 00:55:10.260 align:start position:0%
just suggest that the committee um
 
00:55:13.609 --> 00:55:13.619 align:start position:0%
think through those uh possibilities in
 
00:55:15.230 --> 00:55:15.240 align:start position:0%
the in the law against discrimination
 
00:55:17.329 --> 00:55:17.339 align:start position:0%
context where the Department of Justice
 
00:55:19.970 --> 00:55:19.980 align:start position:0%
actually has subpoena Authority it seems
 
00:55:22.190 --> 00:55:22.200 align:start position:0%
that it can only do so after again the
 
00:55:24.710 --> 00:55:24.720 align:start position:0%
filing of a formal complaint so that
 
00:55:26.329 --> 00:55:26.339 align:start position:0%
limitation exists there and I would
 
00:55:28.370 --> 00:55:28.380 align:start position:0%
suggest that such limitations should be
 
00:55:29.930 --> 00:55:29.940 align:start position:0%
considered by the committee and with
 
00:55:31.549 --> 00:55:31.559 align:start position:0%
that I'll conclude my testimony I'm sure
 
00:55:33.470 --> 00:55:33.480 align:start position:0%
I went over two minutes I'm sorry I'm
 
00:55:35.690 --> 00:55:35.700 align:start position:0%
sorry questions for this Witness I have
 
00:55:38.390 --> 00:55:38.400 align:start position:0%
one yes representative Perez thank you I
 
00:55:40.670 --> 00:55:40.680 align:start position:0%
have one question does the American
 
00:55:44.030 --> 00:55:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:46.490 --> 00:55:46.500 align:start position:0%
also speak for children
 
00:55:50.329 --> 00:55:50.339 align:start position:0%
and parents at any time
 
00:55:52.970 --> 00:55:52.980 align:start position:0%
I think we we do our best when civil
 
00:55:54.170 --> 00:55:54.180 align:start position:0%
liberties and civil rights are
 
00:55:56.210 --> 00:55:56.220 align:start position:0%
implicated no matter who's impacted
 
00:55:58.490 --> 00:55:58.500 align:start position:0%
whether it's children parents other
 
00:56:01.250 --> 00:56:01.260 align:start position:0%
groups to to try to address those
 
00:56:02.450 --> 00:56:02.460 align:start position:0%
concerns on behalf of those
 
00:56:02.460 --> 00:56:04.910 align:start position:0%
concerns on behalf of those
constituencies

00:56:04.910 --> 00:56:04.920 align:start position:0%
constituencies
 
00:56:07.069 --> 00:56:07.079 align:start position:0%
options for this witness seeing none
 
00:56:07.849 --> 00:56:07.859 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you Mr
 
00:56:09.950 --> 00:56:09.960 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you
 
00:56:24.170 --> 00:56:24.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:26.569 --> 00:56:26.579 align:start position:0%
hi strumble hello thank you Mr chairman
 
00:56:27.950 --> 00:56:27.960 align:start position:0%
I'm David Trumbull I'm from the town
 
00:56:30.710 --> 00:56:30.720 align:start position:0%
aware representing myself I'm opposed to
 
00:56:32.870 --> 00:56:32.880 align:start position:0%
this bill for several reasons first is I
 
00:56:34.609 --> 00:56:34.619 align:start position:0%
think the use of the Attorney General is
 
00:56:36.710 --> 00:56:36.720 align:start position:0%
a more appropriate means for this to be
 
00:56:40.609 --> 00:56:40.619 align:start position:0%
enacted looking up other places where
 
00:56:43.370 --> 00:56:43.380 align:start position:0%
children are at stake look at RSA 170
 
00:56:45.710 --> 00:56:45.720 align:start position:0%
e41 deals with daycare residential
 
00:56:47.930 --> 00:56:47.940 align:start position:0%
centers and child placement agencies the
 
00:56:50.329 --> 00:56:50.339 align:start position:0%
commissioner of HHS then can get a
 
00:56:51.890 --> 00:56:51.900 align:start position:0%
subpoena by going to the attorney
 
00:56:54.410 --> 00:56:54.420 align:start position:0%
general and showing good cause so if
 
00:56:56.329 --> 00:56:56.339 align:start position:0%
this is only being used as a last resort
 
00:56:59.510 --> 00:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
as the investigator testified just do it
 
00:57:01.549 --> 00:57:01.559 align:start position:0%
that way that's an example that works
 
00:57:04.609 --> 00:57:04.619 align:start position:0%
number two is the analogy to the oplc
 
00:57:07.069 --> 00:57:07.079 align:start position:0%
really doesn't work and here's why under
 
00:57:10.670 --> 00:57:10.680 align:start position:0%
RSA 310a they lay out a whole series of
 
00:57:13.430 --> 00:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
procedural due process requirements that
 
00:57:15.170 --> 00:57:15.180 align:start position:0%
are absent from the bill in front of you
 
00:57:17.450 --> 00:57:17.460 align:start position:0%
first a complaint has to be filed in
 
00:57:21.170 --> 00:57:21.180 align:start position:0%
under the oplc not here sir service to
 
00:57:22.670 --> 00:57:22.680 align:start position:0%
the person who the complaint is against
 
00:57:25.790 --> 00:57:25.800 align:start position:0%
has to be given not here the oplc
 
00:57:27.829 --> 00:57:27.839 align:start position:0%
requires long record keeping so that
 
00:57:29.450 --> 00:57:29.460 align:start position:0%
they can keep track of their subpoena
 
00:57:31.730 --> 00:57:31.740 align:start position:0%
systems nothing here for the doe to do
 
00:57:33.470 --> 00:57:33.480 align:start position:0%
that lastly there's an oversight
 
00:57:35.990 --> 00:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
Committee in the legislature to oversee
 
00:57:38.809 --> 00:57:38.819 align:start position:0%
the oplc nothing in this bill says that
 
00:57:40.490 --> 00:57:40.500 align:start position:0%
the doe has to then come back and
 
00:57:41.990 --> 00:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
provide you with data so you can make
 
00:57:43.670 --> 00:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
sure that it's being done properly
 
00:57:46.370 --> 00:57:46.380 align:start position:0%
number three if as testified this bill
 
00:57:49.010 --> 00:57:49.020 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with divisive Concepts
 
00:57:51.230 --> 00:57:51.240 align:start position:0%
then write that into the law that this
 
00:57:53.270 --> 00:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
bill does not apply to cases that are
 
00:57:54.589 --> 00:57:54.599 align:start position:0%
going to the Human Rights Commission
 
00:57:56.089 --> 00:57:56.099 align:start position:0%
that would avoid the problem that the
 
00:57:57.829 --> 00:57:57.839 align:start position:0%
attorney from the issue you said where
 
00:57:59.569 --> 00:57:59.579 align:start position:0%
you have multiple disparate agencies
 
00:58:02.390 --> 00:58:02.400 align:start position:0%
running through this issue number four
 
00:58:05.930 --> 00:58:05.940 align:start position:0%
the oplc is an oversight agency go to
 
00:58:07.970 --> 00:58:07.980 align:start position:0%
their website and on the about who are
 
00:58:10.069 --> 00:58:10.079 align:start position:0%
we section it says they provide
 
00:58:11.690 --> 00:58:11.700 align:start position:0%
administrative clerical business
 
00:58:14.030 --> 00:58:14.040 align:start position:0%
processing and record keeping support to
 
00:58:16.430 --> 00:58:16.440 align:start position:0%
like 47 different occupational groups
 
00:58:18.230 --> 00:58:18.240 align:start position:0%
they only actually oversee a couple of
 
00:58:20.150 --> 00:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
the smaller ones they're not doing
 
00:58:22.309 --> 00:58:22.319 align:start position:0%
independent investigations this bill
 
00:58:24.890 --> 00:58:24.900 align:start position:0%
creates unchecked power for the
 
00:58:27.290 --> 00:58:27.300 align:start position:0%
Department of Education at any stage to
 
00:58:29.270 --> 00:58:29.280 align:start position:0%
go issue subpoenas and do it on their
 
00:58:31.910 --> 00:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
own that's different than the oplc so if
 
00:58:33.410 --> 00:58:33.420 align:start position:0%
you're using that as a model I suggest
 
00:58:36.109 --> 00:58:36.119 align:start position:0%
you do some research on the oplc lastly
 
00:58:37.849 --> 00:58:37.859 align:start position:0%
this is a broader question of
 
00:58:39.829 --> 00:58:39.839 align:start position:0%
administrative investigations I'll
 
00:58:41.930 --> 00:58:41.940 align:start position:0%
finish with a short sentence from
 
00:58:43.910 --> 00:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
Professor gavor who teaches law at
 
00:58:45.710 --> 00:58:45.720 align:start position:0%
George Washington law school he wrote an
 
00:58:48.589 --> 00:58:48.599 align:start position:0%
article in 2020. on this topic he said
 
00:58:50.450 --> 00:58:50.460 align:start position:0%
another harm from improper agency
 
00:58:52.730 --> 00:58:52.740 align:start position:0%
investigations is constitutional
 
00:58:55.069 --> 00:58:55.079 align:start position:0%
horizontal separation of powers concerns
 
00:58:57.349 --> 00:58:57.359 align:start position:0%
many administrative agencies operate in
 
00:58:59.390 --> 00:58:59.400 align:start position:0%
a zone that is free of oversight from
 
00:59:01.069 --> 00:59:01.079 align:start position:0%
both the policy prerogatives of the
 
00:59:02.870 --> 00:59:02.880 align:start position:0%
first branch and the oversight of the
 
00:59:05.089 --> 00:59:05.099 align:start position:0%
third branch especially if the organic
 
00:59:07.910 --> 00:59:07.920 align:start position:0%
statute provides no guidelines or review
 
00:59:10.750 --> 00:59:10.760 align:start position:0%
of investigative practices the result
 
00:59:13.490 --> 00:59:13.500 align:start position:0%
the totally and systematically is the
 
00:59:15.890 --> 00:59:15.900 align:start position:0%
risk of tyrannical Behavior by agencies
 
00:59:17.870 --> 00:59:17.880 align:start position:0%
and within them bureaucrats who are not
 
00:59:20.809 --> 00:59:20.819 align:start position:0%
politically accountable this bill gives
 
00:59:23.390 --> 00:59:23.400 align:start position:0%
broad power it does not set up any
 
00:59:25.970 --> 00:59:25.980 align:start position:0%
checks on that power it's a risk no
 
00:59:27.710 --> 00:59:27.720 align:start position:0%
matter what political party you're from
 
00:59:29.150 --> 00:59:29.160 align:start position:0%
you don't want to create that much power
 
00:59:31.490 --> 00:59:31.500 align:start position:0%
without risk put some guidelines on this
 
00:59:33.170 --> 00:59:33.180 align:start position:0%
go through the Attorney General that's
 
00:59:34.910 --> 00:59:34.920 align:start position:0%
what we do with daycare residential
 
00:59:36.289 --> 00:59:36.299 align:start position:0%
centers that would be a more reasonable
 
00:59:38.750 --> 00:59:38.760 align:start position:0%
step thank you questions for this
 
00:59:41.210 --> 00:59:41.220 align:start position:0%
witness yes representative lorenza Take
 
00:59:43.789 --> 00:59:43.799 align:start position:0%
Care thank you for your testimony do you
 
00:59:47.690 --> 00:59:47.700 align:start position:0%
have written copies of um what you um I
 
00:59:49.670 --> 00:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
don't have anything I can send something
 
00:59:51.349 --> 00:59:51.359 align:start position:0%
to the committee tonight
 
00:59:52.970 --> 00:59:52.980 align:start position:0%
thank you so much thank you for the
 
00:59:52.980 --> 00:59:55.450 align:start position:0%
thank you so much thank you for the
questions

00:59:55.450 --> 00:59:55.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:59.270 --> 00:59:59.280 align:start position:0%
yes representative Macbeth thank you so
 
01:00:00.770 --> 01:00:00.780 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony and again
 
01:00:02.150 --> 01:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
this might you might not be the right
 
01:00:04.789 --> 01:00:04.799 align:start position:0%
person but I'm interested in this broad
 
01:00:06.710 --> 01:00:06.720 align:start position:0%
um you know the code of conducts the the
 
01:00:08.630 --> 01:00:08.640 align:start position:0%
Department of Education has is there
 
01:00:10.549 --> 01:00:10.559 align:start position:0%
anything like that I mean that you found
 
01:00:14.630 --> 01:00:14.640 align:start position:0%
that the uh oplc would be um
 
01:00:16.730 --> 01:00:16.740 align:start position:0%
investigating as far as you know code of
 
01:00:20.089 --> 01:00:20.099 align:start position:0%
contact the oplc has it's kind of an
 
01:00:22.190 --> 01:00:22.200 align:start position:0%
oversight Agency for
 
01:00:24.530 --> 01:00:24.540 align:start position:0%
um of the types of groups they deal with
 
01:00:27.410 --> 01:00:27.420 align:start position:0%
is from body artists to
 
01:00:30.349 --> 01:00:30.359 align:start position:0%
um septic system groups to Health
 
01:00:32.569 --> 01:00:32.579 align:start position:0%
Providers at 47 different types of
 
01:00:35.329 --> 01:00:35.339 align:start position:0%
agencies who all individually seem to
 
01:00:37.849 --> 01:00:37.859 align:start position:0%
govern their own profession with a
 
01:00:39.230 --> 01:00:39.240 align:start position:0%
couple of small exceptions apparently
 
01:00:40.609 --> 01:00:40.619 align:start position:0%
only three or four
 
01:00:42.589 --> 01:00:42.599 align:start position:0%
they all obviously have strong codes
 
01:00:44.450 --> 01:00:44.460 align:start position:0%
that they have to follow I think the
 
01:00:45.890 --> 01:00:45.900 align:start position:0%
difference is that those types of
 
01:00:47.809 --> 01:00:47.819 align:start position:0%
professions and the what's going on with
 
01:00:50.230 --> 01:00:50.240 align:start position:0%
the oplc is they're looking at technical
 
01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
competence like did you actually measure
 
01:00:55.370 --> 01:00:55.380 align:start position:0%
the septic system properly or is the
 
01:00:57.349 --> 01:00:57.359 align:start position:0%
tattoo artist being safe in their
 
01:01:00.710 --> 01:01:00.720 align:start position:0%
workplace this bill has the potential to
 
01:01:02.270 --> 01:01:02.280 align:start position:0%
be used not just for technical
 
01:01:04.549 --> 01:01:04.559 align:start position:0%
compliance but for content in other
 
01:01:07.130 --> 01:01:07.140 align:start position:0%
words the commissioner could or a future
 
01:01:09.049 --> 01:01:09.059 align:start position:0%
commissioner could or the person who's
 
01:01:10.370 --> 01:01:10.380 align:start position:0%
now on the State Board of Education
 
01:01:12.289 --> 01:01:12.299 align:start position:0%
could become a future commissioner and
 
01:01:14.990 --> 01:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
use this bill to govern content in the
 
01:01:17.030 --> 01:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
classroom so they could say well you you
 
01:01:19.130 --> 01:01:19.140 align:start position:0%
started talking about race issues in in
 
01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:20.520 align:start position:0%
the class and I don't want you doing
 
01:01:22.549 --> 01:01:22.559 align:start position:0%
that so the chilling effect the
 
01:01:24.230 --> 01:01:24.240 align:start position:0%
potential chilling effect on our
 
01:01:25.849 --> 01:01:25.859 align:start position:0%
teachers could be that they'll just say
 
01:01:27.829 --> 01:01:27.839 align:start position:0%
I don't want to get subpoenaed just
 
01:01:30.049 --> 01:01:30.059 align:start position:0%
because I brought up a civil rights
 
01:01:31.670 --> 01:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
issue in my class so they stop talking
 
01:01:33.950 --> 01:01:33.960 align:start position:0%
about these important things
 
01:01:36.349 --> 01:01:36.359 align:start position:0%
you're welcome other other questions for
 
01:01:37.250 --> 01:01:37.260 align:start position:0%
this Witness
 
01:01:39.770 --> 01:01:39.780 align:start position:0%
thank you very much sir thank you
 
01:01:50.569 --> 01:01:50.579 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:52.549 --> 01:01:52.559 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and members of the
 
01:01:53.930 --> 01:01:53.940 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Mary Wilke I'm from
 
01:01:55.910 --> 01:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
Concord I'm a retired public school
 
01:01:58.730 --> 01:01:58.740 align:start position:0%
teacher and could you speak closer to
 
01:02:02.150 --> 01:02:02.160 align:start position:0%
the microphone sure do you mean me to
 
01:02:03.829 --> 01:02:03.839 align:start position:0%
repeat that
 
01:02:05.990 --> 01:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:02:09.829 --> 01:02:09.839 align:start position:0%
um I oppose HB 533 as amended and I um
 
01:02:11.210 --> 01:02:11.220 align:start position:0%
for many of the reasons that have
 
01:02:13.789 --> 01:02:13.799 align:start position:0%
already been stated I want to just add
 
01:02:16.190 --> 01:02:16.200 align:start position:0%
that I think it's really important to
 
01:02:18.589 --> 01:02:18.599 align:start position:0%
consider this bill in the context of
 
01:02:20.089 --> 01:02:20.099 align:start position:0%
what's been going on in the last few
 
01:02:23.109 --> 01:02:23.119 align:start position:0%
years regarding public education
 
01:02:26.270 --> 01:02:26.280 align:start position:0%
as a retired teacher I've found it
 
01:02:28.789 --> 01:02:28.799 align:start position:0%
incredibly disheartening to see Bill
 
01:02:31.069 --> 01:02:31.079 align:start position:0%
after Bill filed in this legislature
 
01:02:33.589 --> 01:02:33.599 align:start position:0%
based on the premise that teachers spend
 
01:02:36.130 --> 01:02:36.140 align:start position:0%
their days indoctrinating children
 
01:02:39.289 --> 01:02:39.299 align:start position:0%
wanting them to become marxists wanting
 
01:02:40.849 --> 01:02:40.859 align:start position:0%
them to feel guilty about their skin
 
01:02:43.250 --> 01:02:43.260 align:start position:0%
color sharing obscene materials with
 
01:02:45.170 --> 01:02:45.180 align:start position:0%
them or pushing them to change their
 
01:02:46.849 --> 01:02:46.859 align:start position:0%
gender identities
 
01:02:49.190 --> 01:02:49.200 align:start position:0%
in all of the schools I've taught in or
 
01:02:50.990 --> 01:02:51.000 align:start position:0%
volunteered in over the course of my
 
01:02:52.789 --> 01:02:52.799 align:start position:0%
life or that my own children and
 
01:02:54.710 --> 01:02:54.720 align:start position:0%
grandchildren have attended I've never
 
01:02:56.870 --> 01:02:56.880 align:start position:0%
met a single teacher that fits that

met a single teacher that fits that

01:03:00.230 --> 01:03:00.240 align:start position:0%
if teachers are lying awake at night
 
01:03:02.569 --> 01:03:02.579 align:start position:0%
it's not trying to dream up ways to
 
01:03:04.970 --> 01:03:04.980 align:start position:0%
indoctrinate their students it's
 
01:03:06.950 --> 01:03:06.960 align:start position:0%
worrying about how that reluctant reader
 
01:03:08.750 --> 01:03:08.760 align:start position:0%
and how to spark an interest in reading
 
01:03:10.970 --> 01:03:10.980 align:start position:0%
or worrying about that child whose
 
01:03:13.250 --> 01:03:13.260 align:start position:0%
mother is dying of cancer how to support
 
01:03:16.490 --> 01:03:16.500 align:start position:0%

passing meanwhile
 
01:03:19.079 --> 01:03:20.930 align:start position:0%
passing meanwhile
um

01:03:20.930 --> 01:03:20.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:24.109 --> 01:03:24.119 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education has a portal
 
01:03:26.809 --> 01:03:26.819 align:start position:0%
on its website encouraging parents to
 
01:03:29.510 --> 01:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
report so-called Rogue teachers and the
 
01:03:32.030 --> 01:03:32.040 align:start position:0%
moms of Liberty put out a 500 bounty on
 
01:03:34.309 --> 01:03:34.319 align:start position:0%
the hands of teachers and you'd get 500
 
01:03:36.109 --> 01:03:36.119 align:start position:0%
if you reported a teacher and they got
 
01:03:38.630 --> 01:03:38.640 align:start position:0%
prosecuted under the divisive Concepts
 
01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:42.049 align:start position:0%

bill

01:03:42.049 --> 01:03:42.059 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:46.309 --> 01:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
it's just so painful this this constant
 
01:03:49.069 --> 01:03:49.079 align:start position:0%
unfounded attack on public schools some
 
01:03:50.750 --> 01:03:50.760 align:start position:0%
of which is being funded by national
 
01:03:52.789 --> 01:03:52.799 align:start position:0%
groups that are trying to undermine the
 
01:03:56.030 --> 01:03:56.040 align:start position:0%
whole concept of public education
 
01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:59.510 align:start position:0%
whole concept of public education
um

01:03:59.510 --> 01:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:02.270 --> 01:04:02.280 align:start position:0%
I guess I I just want to say that if you
 
01:04:04.789 --> 01:04:04.799 align:start position:0%
pass a bill like this now in this
 
01:04:07.490 --> 01:04:07.500 align:start position:0%
environment it just piles on to those
 
01:04:10.789 --> 01:04:10.799 align:start position:0%
accusations it sends the message that
 
01:04:13.430 --> 01:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
teachers need to be subpoenaed that they
 
01:04:16.370 --> 01:04:16.380 align:start position:0%
are harboring suspect documents that
 
01:04:18.470 --> 01:04:18.480 align:start position:0%
have to be seized because we just can't
 
01:04:21.289 --> 01:04:21.299 align:start position:0%
trust Public Public School teachers and
 
01:04:23.750 --> 01:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
I just hope that you will consider that
 
01:04:27.470 --> 01:04:27.480 align:start position:0%
as collateral damage of passing a bill
 
01:04:30.170 --> 01:04:30.180 align:start position:0%
like this in this time thank you thank
 
01:04:31.849 --> 01:04:31.859 align:start position:0%
you questions for this Witness
 
01:04:34.069 --> 01:04:34.079 align:start position:0%
yes representative Brennan thank you
 
01:04:36.530 --> 01:04:36.540 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
01:04:39.890 --> 01:04:39.900 align:start position:0%
would it be fair to say or would it be
 
01:04:41.930 --> 01:04:41.940 align:start position:0%
fair to
 
01:04:41.940 --> 01:04:42.950 align:start position:0%
fair to
um

01:04:42.950 --> 01:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:47.089 --> 01:04:47.099 align:start position:0%
interpret your testimony
 
01:04:47.099 --> 01:04:49.789 align:start position:0%
interpret your testimony
um

01:04:49.789 --> 01:04:49.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:51.710 --> 01:04:51.720 align:start position:0%
would it be an accurate interpretation
 
01:04:55.250 --> 01:04:55.260 align:start position:0%
of your testimony to suggest that the
 
01:04:56.870 --> 01:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
amendment that's before this committee
 
01:04:56.880 --> 01:04:58.450 align:start position:0%
amendment that's before this committee
today

01:04:58.450 --> 01:04:58.460 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:05:02.450 --> 01:05:02.460 align:start position:0%
isn't is based on political reasoning
 
01:05:05.809 --> 01:05:05.819 align:start position:0%
rather than something based in data in
 
01:05:07.849 --> 01:05:07.859 align:start position:0%
fact is that an accurate interpretation
 
01:05:11.329 --> 01:05:11.339 align:start position:0%
of your no I don't know I'm not quite
 
01:05:12.770 --> 01:05:12.780 align:start position:0%
sure of the relevance of that to
 
01:05:15.289 --> 01:05:15.299 align:start position:0%
anything we have but go ahead I'm I'm I
 
01:05:17.390 --> 01:05:17.400 align:start position:0%
tend to let people
 
01:05:19.190 --> 01:05:19.200 align:start position:0%
it's up to you you may answer or not
 
01:05:21.170 --> 01:05:21.180 align:start position:0%
answer it's up to you
 
01:05:23.990 --> 01:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
I don't know what the motive
 
01:05:26.569 --> 01:05:26.579 align:start position:0%
motivate context is and and right now
 
01:05:26.579 --> 01:05:27.710 align:start position:0%
motivate context is and and right now
there's

01:05:27.710 --> 01:05:27.720 align:start position:0%
there's
 
01:05:30.950 --> 01:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
seems to be constant
 
01:05:33.349 --> 01:05:33.359 align:start position:0%
um innuendo through often through
 
01:05:35.750 --> 01:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
legislation or through attempts at
 
01:05:37.789 --> 01:05:37.799 align:start position:0%
legislation innuendo that casts
 
01:05:39.349 --> 01:05:39.359 align:start position:0%
dispersions on public school teachers
 
01:05:41.150 --> 01:05:41.160 align:start position:0%
that I think are unfounded
 
01:05:42.950 --> 01:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
other questions for this witness thank
 
01:05:45.170 --> 01:05:45.180 align:start position:0%

533 I'm Deborah house president of the
 
01:06:24.589 --> 01:06:24.599 align:start position:0%
American Federation of teachers we've
 
01:06:26.329 --> 01:06:26.339 align:start position:0%
got about 4 000 members across the
 
01:06:29.450 --> 01:06:29.460 align:start position:0%
straight state in pre-k through 12
 
01:06:29.460 --> 01:06:30.950 align:start position:0%

education

01:06:30.950 --> 01:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:32.270 align:start position:0%
education
um

01:06:32.270 --> 01:06:32.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:35.690 --> 01:06:35.700 align:start position:0%
you know teachers all sorts of Educators
 
01:06:38.809 --> 01:06:38.819 align:start position:0%
um School support staff as well as in
 
01:06:43.250 --> 01:06:43.260 align:start position:0%
the University system and in various
 
01:06:46.430 --> 01:06:46.440 align:start position:0%
Town employees so much of what I've said
 
01:06:48.289 --> 01:06:48.299 align:start position:0%
has already been covered by President
 
01:06:51.589 --> 01:06:51.599 align:start position:0%
tunnel from Nea and by the New Hampshire
 
01:06:53.750 --> 01:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
ACLU so I'll stick to a few points here
 
01:06:56.710 --> 01:06:56.720 align:start position:0%
we do feel that this subpoena power
 
01:06:59.690 --> 01:06:59.700 align:start position:0%
despite you know what we heard and we we
 
01:07:01.130 --> 01:07:01.140 align:start position:0%
believe the good intentions of the
 
01:07:03.589 --> 01:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
investigator but we feel the um
 
01:07:07.010 --> 01:07:07.020 align:start position:0%
Amendment would be overly broad it would
 
01:07:10.190 --> 01:07:10.200 align:start position:0%
give an unprecedented power to a
 
01:07:12.710 --> 01:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
political appointee to allow for
 
01:07:14.450 --> 01:07:14.460 align:start position:0%
subpoenas at any time during an
 
01:07:16.609 --> 01:07:16.619 align:start position:0%
investigation without appropriate guard
 
01:07:19.910 --> 01:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
rails to protect the rights of someone
 
01:07:22.370 --> 01:07:22.380 align:start position:0%
who is just
 
01:07:24.470 --> 01:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
accused without maybe even knowing
 
01:07:25.849 --> 01:07:25.859 align:start position:0%
they're being accused
 
01:07:28.210 --> 01:07:28.220 align:start position:0%
until that Sabina arrives
 
01:07:30.230 --> 01:07:30.240 align:start position:0%
you know there's nothing in that
 
01:07:32.029 --> 01:07:32.039 align:start position:0%
amendment that says when those subpoenas
 
01:07:34.609 --> 01:07:34.619 align:start position:0%
would come and I I do believe the good
 
01:07:36.349 --> 01:07:36.359 align:start position:0%
intentions of that limited list that we
 
01:07:38.390 --> 01:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
heard about but it's not in writing so
 
01:07:40.549 --> 01:07:40.559 align:start position:0%
therefore that doesn't necessarily mean
 
01:07:42.349 --> 01:07:42.359 align:start position:0%
it would occur past the time when that
 
01:07:45.770 --> 01:07:45.780 align:start position:0%
gentleman is holding that position
 
01:07:45.780 --> 01:07:46.730 align:start position:0%
gentleman is holding that position
um

01:07:46.730 --> 01:07:46.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:48.650 --> 01:07:48.660 align:start position:0%
and I want to talk a little bit about
 
01:07:51.650 --> 01:07:51.660 align:start position:0%
the code of conduct that covers all of
 
01:07:53.750 --> 01:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
your licensed Professionals in schools
 
01:07:56.150 --> 01:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
teachers guidance counselors
 
01:07:57.589 --> 01:07:57.599 align:start position:0%
um you know school principals all of
 
01:08:00.410 --> 01:08:00.420 align:start position:0%
them but it covers every interaction you
 
01:08:02.390 --> 01:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
have with the student so it's not a
 
01:08:04.190 --> 01:08:04.200 align:start position:0%
narrow scope we're talking about it's
 
01:08:06.289 --> 01:08:06.299 align:start position:0%
everything you do that involves students
 
01:08:08.210 --> 01:08:08.220 align:start position:0%
it's very broad so you could be
 
01:08:10.130 --> 01:08:10.140 align:start position:0%
subpoenaed about any interaction you
 
01:08:12.109 --> 01:08:12.119 align:start position:0%
have with the student at any time that
 
01:08:15.049 --> 01:08:15.059 align:start position:0%
happens now or in the past that's a lot
 
01:08:17.990 --> 01:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
of ground you could cover with it
 
01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.189 align:start position:0%
of ground you could cover with it
um

01:08:19.189 --> 01:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:22.249 --> 01:08:22.259 align:start position:0%
and if this is about safety of students
 
01:08:24.229 --> 01:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
you are missing all of those people who
 
01:08:25.910 --> 01:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
work in schools
 
01:08:30.890 --> 01:08:30.900 align:start position:0%
that do not have a license so it is not
 
01:08:34.010 --> 01:08:34.020 align:start position:0%
answering the problem necessarily it is
 
01:08:34.020 --> 01:08:35.990 align:start position:0%
answering the problem necessarily it is
just

01:08:35.990 --> 01:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:08:38.630 --> 01:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
going after one portion of the
 
01:08:40.970 --> 01:08:40.980 align:start position:0%
population that works in schools
 
01:08:44.209 --> 01:08:44.219 align:start position:0%
we heard from the presenters of this
 
01:08:47.269 --> 01:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
amendment that the code of conduct has
 
01:08:49.370 --> 01:08:49.380 align:start position:0%
been weaponized and we have seen that
 
01:08:51.349 --> 01:08:51.359 align:start position:0%
and we are feeling that my members are
 
01:08:54.709 --> 01:08:54.719 align:start position:0%
feeling that we hear allegations you you
 
01:08:56.749 --> 01:08:56.759 align:start position:0%
know have heard mention of some of them
 
01:08:59.870 --> 01:08:59.880 align:start position:0%
in this room about how teachers are
 
01:09:02.809 --> 01:09:02.819 align:start position:0%
being accused of teaching
 
01:09:05.030 --> 01:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
all sorts of
 
01:09:07.849 --> 01:09:07.859 align:start position:0%
things that uh is news to us that we're
 
01:09:10.610 --> 01:09:10.620 align:start position:0%
teaching them okay we we are not out
 
01:09:12.590 --> 01:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
there you know teaching
 
01:09:14.390 --> 01:09:14.400 align:start position:0%
children they can choose their gender or
 
01:09:16.130 --> 01:09:16.140 align:start position:0%
things all sorts of other
 
01:09:16.140 --> 01:09:17.349 align:start position:0%
things all sorts of other
really

01:09:17.349 --> 01:09:17.359 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:09:19.970 --> 01:09:19.980 align:start position:0%
astounding allegations
 
01:09:22.010 --> 01:09:22.020 align:start position:0%
but that's the weaponization that we
 
01:09:22.020 --> 01:09:23.530 align:start position:0%
but that's the weaponization that we
fear

01:09:23.530 --> 01:09:23.540 align:start position:0%
fear
 
01:09:26.090 --> 01:09:26.100 align:start position:0%
would turn into
 
01:09:28.550 --> 01:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
code of conduct investigations and
 
01:09:31.189 --> 01:09:31.199 align:start position:0%
subpoenas if this amendment were to be
 
01:09:33.050 --> 01:09:33.060 align:start position:0%
passed so it would lead to more
 
01:09:35.390 --> 01:09:35.400 align:start position:0%
harassment of your certified
 
01:09:38.870 --> 01:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
professionals and a greater flight from
 
01:09:42.729 --> 01:09:42.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:46.010 --> 01:09:46.020 align:start position:0%
increasing the workforce shortage
 
01:09:48.229 --> 01:09:48.239 align:start position:0%
so the limitations are not written into
 
01:09:49.669 --> 01:09:49.679 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:09:52.070 --> 01:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
it's overly Broad and it's going to
 
01:09:54.110 --> 01:09:54.120 align:start position:0%
drive people out of the profession when
 
01:09:56.689 --> 01:09:56.699 align:start position:0%
really what we want to do is have the
 
01:09:58.970 --> 01:09:58.980 align:start position:0%
ability to focus on educating our
 
01:10:01.850 --> 01:10:01.860 align:start position:0%
students and giving them what they need
 
01:10:04.430 --> 01:10:04.440 align:start position:0%
to learn and succeed that's what we're
 
01:10:06.050 --> 01:10:06.060 align:start position:0%
asking for we're asking for Less
 
01:10:06.060 --> 01:10:07.490 align:start position:0%
asking for we're asking for Less
interference

01:10:07.490 --> 01:10:07.500 align:start position:0%
interference
 
01:10:11.510 --> 01:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
in doing our jobs we're not asking for
 
01:10:14.150 --> 01:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
any sort of you know
 
01:10:18.110 --> 01:10:18.120 align:start position:0%
lessening of the safety aspects but
 
01:10:19.490 --> 01:10:19.500 align:start position:0%
don't put
 
01:10:21.169 --> 01:10:21.179 align:start position:0%
an inappropriate
 
01:10:25.010 --> 01:10:25.020 align:start position:0%
the broad tool in someone's hands that
 
01:10:27.890 --> 01:10:27.900 align:start position:0%
could be misused however no matter whose
 
01:10:30.290 --> 01:10:30.300 align:start position:0%
hand it's it it could be misused it has
 
01:10:34.130 --> 01:10:34.140 align:start position:0%
great potential for becoming a weapon
 
01:10:37.010 --> 01:10:37.020 align:start position:0%
against a whole lot of people who are
 
01:10:39.850 --> 01:10:39.860 align:start position:0%
just trying to help students questions
 
01:10:43.250 --> 01:10:43.260 align:start position:0%
thank you questions for this Witness
 
01:10:45.770 --> 01:10:45.780 align:start position:0%
yes uh representative
 
01:10:47.510 --> 01:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:10:48.890 --> 01:10:48.900 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:10:51.050 --> 01:10:51.060 align:start position:0%
I think we heard earlier that there was
 
01:10:53.930 --> 01:10:53.940 align:start position:0%
Specter of false allegations made
 
01:10:55.970 --> 01:10:55.980 align:start position:0%
against teachers
 
01:10:58.330 --> 01:10:58.340 align:start position:0%
that's a very harmful thing
 
01:11:01.310 --> 01:11:01.320 align:start position:0%
is there a possibility that the supine
 
01:11:02.750 --> 01:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
of power
 
01:11:06.830 --> 01:11:06.840 align:start position:0%
not only is accusatory but exculpatory
 
01:11:11.030 --> 01:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
and can actually get to the truth and
 
01:11:14.030 --> 01:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
um relieve those teachers of the Specter
 
01:11:18.709 --> 01:11:18.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:21.410 --> 01:11:21.420 align:start position:0%
that's not a question that I have any
 
01:11:23.510 --> 01:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
information to answer so I will not
 
01:11:26.510 --> 01:11:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:27.530 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:11:27.530 --> 01:11:27.540 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:11:27.540 --> 01:11:29.570 align:start position:0%
yeah
I

01:11:29.570 --> 01:11:29.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:31.970 --> 01:11:31.980 align:start position:0%
I can't give you anything to shed light
 
01:11:33.770 --> 01:11:33.780 align:start position:0%
on that I I apologize but no that's
 
01:11:36.530 --> 01:11:36.540 align:start position:0%
that's all right it was a point of
 
01:11:39.050 --> 01:11:39.060 align:start position:0%
thought it is a point of thought but um
 
01:11:40.729 --> 01:11:40.739 align:start position:0%
I I can't get you any further along the
 
01:11:42.110 --> 01:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
line there
 
01:11:44.630 --> 01:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
other questions for this witness thank
 
01:11:46.669 --> 01:11:46.679 align:start position:0%
you very much okay
 
01:11:50.630 --> 01:11:50.640 align:start position:0%
I see I have no other uh Pink cards from
 
01:11:52.370 --> 01:11:52.380 align:start position:0%
anyone is there anyone else who wishes
 
01:11:58.610 --> 01:11:58.620 align:start position:0%
to testify on the amendment to HB 533
 
01:12:01.550 --> 01:12:01.560 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'm gonna close the hearing
 
01:12:06.830 --> 01:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:14.709 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:12:14.709 --> 01:12:14.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:16.790 --> 01:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
all right so what I'm going to do is
 
01:12:19.729 --> 01:12:19.739 align:start position:0%
we're we're going to uh
 
01:12:21.950 --> 01:12:21.960 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to open and immediately
 
01:12:23.990 --> 01:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
recess the executive session we're going
 
01:12:26.090 --> 01:12:26.100 align:start position:0%
to take about a 15 minute break because
 
01:12:28.970 --> 01:12:28.980 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm myself and representative kutab
 
01:12:31.189 --> 01:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
are for lack of a better term using a
 
01:12:33.649 --> 01:12:33.659 align:start position:0%
point of personal privilege the band the
 
01:12:35.810 --> 01:12:35.820 align:start position:0%
school band from Windham is playing over
 
01:12:38.030 --> 01:12:38.040 align:start position:0%
it before the executive Council and we
 
01:12:39.350 --> 01:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
want to go over and at least make a
 
01:12:41.270 --> 01:12:41.280 align:start position:0%
brief appearance before just to support
 
01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:42.130 align:start position:0%
brief appearance before just to support
them

01:12:42.130 --> 01:12:42.140 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:12:42.140 --> 01:12:43.930 align:start position:0%
them
no

01:12:43.930 --> 01:12:43.940 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:12:46.550 --> 01:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
that's that would definitely be a turn
 
01:13:00.790 --> 01:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:34.209 --> 01:13:34.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:35.870 --> 01:13:35.880 align:start position:0%
I'm trying
 
01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:52.310 align:start position:0%
I'm trying
to understand

01:13:52.310 --> 01:13:52.320 align:start position:0%

01:15:11.990 --> 01:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
and now you're going to be doubting
 
01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:45.350 align:start position:0%
and now you're going to be doubting
myself

01:15:45.350 --> 01:15:45.360 align:start position:0%

01:22:37.970 --> 01:22:37.980 align:start position:0%
I think
 
01:23:14.709 --> 01:23:14.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:16.790 --> 01:23:16.800 align:start position:0%
I was told
 
01:23:20.450 --> 01:23:20.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:39.550 --> 01:23:39.560 align:start position:0%

01:24:34.750 --> 01:24:34.760 align:start position:0%
I like your sweater

foreign

01:27:17.890 --> 01:27:17.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:49.729 --> 01:27:49.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:49.739 --> 01:28:12.669 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:28:12.669 --> 01:28:12.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:36.470 --> 01:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:36.480 --> 01:29:06.649 align:start position:0%
 
problems

01:29:06.649 --> 01:29:06.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:06.659 --> 01:44:30.649 align:start position:0%

01:44:33.350 --> 01:44:33.360 align:start position:0%
okay all right
 
01:44:36.410 --> 01:44:36.420 align:start position:0%
all right um I'm gonna call the
 
01:44:38.209 --> 01:44:38.219 align:start position:0%
executive session of the house Judiciary

and I'm first uh I'm going to take out
 
01:44:48.169 --> 01:44:48.179 align:start position:0%
of order because we have a uh uh uh an
 
01:44:50.510 --> 01:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
attorney here who worked significantly
 
01:44:53.629 --> 01:44:53.639 align:start position:0%
on the amendment to House Bill 68 and if
 
01:44:56.270 --> 01:44:56.280 align:start position:0%
anyone has questions she's the expert

01:45:01.910 --> 01:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
knowledge so uh first I'm going to
 
01:45:03.910 --> 01:45:03.920 align:start position:0%

01:45:08.030 --> 01:45:08.040 align:start position:0%
to uh move the adoption of House Bill 68
 
01:45:10.629 --> 01:45:10.639 align:start position:0%

01:45:10.639 --> 01:45:13.030 align:start position:0%
and to offer Amendment
2023

01:45:13.030 --> 01:45:13.040 align:start position:0%
2023
 
01:45:16.370 --> 01:45:16.380 align:start position:0%
-436 and move the bill ought to pass
 
01:45:18.890 --> 01:45:18.900 align:start position:0%
with Amendment do I have a second
 
01:45:20.870 --> 01:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
I'll second it Mr chair
 
01:45:24.709 --> 01:45:24.719 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative uh Alexander
 
01:45:24.719 --> 01:45:25.430 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative uh Alexander
um

01:45:25.430 --> 01:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:26.510 --> 01:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:45:28.669 --> 01:45:28.679 align:start position:0%
um so now what I'd like to what I'd like
 
01:45:30.830 --> 01:45:30.840 align:start position:0%
to say and just in speaking about the
 
01:45:33.649 --> 01:45:33.659 align:start position:0%
bill is as you may remember we had an
 
01:45:36.350 --> 01:45:36.360 align:start position:0%
initial hearing on this bill
 
01:45:40.450 --> 01:45:40.460 align:start position:0%
and um uh although I think
 
01:45:43.550 --> 01:45:43.560 align:start position:0%
I'm I I think I'm characterizing this
 
01:45:45.109 --> 01:45:45.119 align:start position:0%
correctly I think although we were we
 
01:45:46.790 --> 01:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
were interested in the bill and thought
 
01:45:49.250 --> 01:45:49.260 align:start position:0%
it might very well make sense there were
 
01:45:50.870 --> 01:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
a number of witnesses who testified to
 
01:45:53.270 --> 01:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
certain concerns about the bill and the
 
01:45:55.790 --> 01:45:55.800 align:start position:0%
way it was left was that
 
01:45:59.109 --> 01:45:59.119 align:start position:0%
um attorney Elise salik who testified
 
01:46:01.729 --> 01:46:01.739 align:start position:0%
indicated that she and a group of
 
01:46:04.070 --> 01:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
attorneys who are sort of experts in the
 
01:46:05.890 --> 01:46:05.900 align:start position:0%
area of trust in Estates
 
01:46:09.709 --> 01:46:09.719 align:start position:0%
and property law would be uh would try
 
01:46:12.430 --> 01:46:12.440 align:start position:0%
to come together and come up with a
 
01:46:15.290 --> 01:46:15.300 align:start position:0%
amendments uh or proposed changes to the
 
01:46:17.510 --> 01:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
bill that would fix the concerns that
 
01:46:20.209 --> 01:46:20.219 align:start position:0%
they raised true to her words she did
 
01:46:22.970 --> 01:46:22.980 align:start position:0%
that and and submitted a proposal to me
 
01:46:26.149 --> 01:46:26.159 align:start position:0%
which I uh which is now Incorporated an
 
01:46:26.159 --> 01:46:27.550 align:start position:0%
which I uh which is now Incorporated an
amendment

01:46:27.550 --> 01:46:27.560 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:46:32.209 --> 01:46:32.219 align:start position:0%
0436h as I looked I looked at it quite
 
01:46:35.090 --> 01:46:35.100 align:start position:0%
carefully and I actually had a couple of
 
01:46:36.950 --> 01:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
questions about for lack of a better
 
01:46:38.870 --> 01:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
term I'll sort of refer to them as
 
01:46:41.270 --> 01:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
technical legal issues as I went through
 
01:46:42.709 --> 01:46:42.719 align:start position:0%
the bill particularly dealing with the
 
01:46:45.709 --> 01:46:45.719 align:start position:0%
issue of joint property ownership which
 
01:46:48.590 --> 01:46:48.600 align:start position:0%
I spoke with uh attorney salic about and
 
01:46:52.129 --> 01:46:52.139 align:start position:0%
she answered my questions you know uh to
 
01:46:54.590 --> 01:46:54.600 align:start position:0%
my complete satisfaction so I what I
 
01:46:57.970 --> 01:46:57.980 align:start position:0%
would say is I am am very comfortable
 
01:47:00.649 --> 01:47:00.659 align:start position:0%
moving this amendment I think it is a
 
01:47:02.830 --> 01:47:02.840 align:start position:0%
good proposal
 
01:47:06.470 --> 01:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
that it will it will
 
01:47:08.990 --> 01:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
provide another opportunity for people
 
01:47:12.410 --> 01:47:12.420 align:start position:0%
who perhaps cannot afford to to obtain
 
01:47:14.810 --> 01:47:14.820 align:start position:0%
the services of a lawyer for a will or
 
01:47:16.010 --> 01:47:16.020 align:start position:0%
something like that we'll provide
 
01:47:19.550 --> 01:47:19.560 align:start position:0%
another opportunity for for them to be
 
01:47:21.669 --> 01:47:21.679 align:start position:0%
able to transfer property
 
01:47:24.830 --> 01:47:24.840 align:start position:0%
and I guess with that I would ask are
 
01:47:27.890 --> 01:47:27.900 align:start position:0%
there attorneys say like is here and I'd
 
01:47:29.510 --> 01:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
ask if members of the committee have
 
01:47:31.450 --> 01:47:31.460 align:start position:0%
questions about any aspects of the bill
 
01:47:34.430 --> 01:47:34.440 align:start position:0%
she she's certainly the person that that
 
01:47:36.250 --> 01:47:36.260 align:start position:0%
would be able to provide the most
 
01:47:39.290 --> 01:47:39.300 align:start position:0%
authoritative answers I believe
 
01:47:40.910 --> 01:47:40.920 align:start position:0%
to um
 
01:47:43.129 --> 01:47:43.139 align:start position:0%
so I have any anyone have any yes uh
 
01:47:45.350 --> 01:47:45.360 align:start position:0%
okay representative Perez please thank
 
01:47:47.750 --> 01:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
you thanks for taking me my only concern
 
01:47:47.760 --> 01:47:49.609 align:start position:0%
you thanks for taking me my only concern
is

01:47:49.609 --> 01:47:49.619 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:47:49.619 --> 01:47:50.270 align:start position:0%
is
um

01:47:50.270 --> 01:47:50.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:53.330 --> 01:47:53.340 align:start position:0%
being a senior myself my only concern is
 
01:47:57.770 --> 01:47:57.780 align:start position:0%
elderly people getting someone who to
 
01:48:00.709 --> 01:48:00.719 align:start position:0%
force them to or coerce them into
 
01:48:03.470 --> 01:48:03.480 align:start position:0%
signing this there's really you know
 
01:48:07.790 --> 01:48:07.800 align:start position:0%
um you know a a young a child and a
 
01:48:10.370 --> 01:48:10.380 align:start position:0%
parent with cognitive issues getting
 
01:48:12.169 --> 01:48:12.179 align:start position:0%
them to sign this there's really no
 
01:48:13.609 --> 01:48:13.619 align:start position:0%
protection but I guess there's no
 
01:48:15.890 --> 01:48:15.900 align:start position:0%
protection and a will either for the
 
01:48:17.270 --> 01:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
same type of things
 
01:48:19.729 --> 01:48:19.739 align:start position:0%
actually in this statute
 
01:48:22.970 --> 01:48:22.980 align:start position:0%
um there is protection built in and I
 
01:48:24.890 --> 01:48:24.900 align:start position:0%
want to be clear that that was one of
 
01:48:26.750 --> 01:48:26.760 align:start position:0%
the issues that my group and I had
 
01:48:28.910 --> 01:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
identified about the original version
 
01:48:31.970 --> 01:48:31.980 align:start position:0%
there wasn't protection built into the
 
01:48:34.669 --> 01:48:34.679 align:start position:0%
original statute so we have addressed
 
01:48:38.090 --> 01:48:38.100 align:start position:0%
that in in two ways first uh there's a
 
01:48:42.350 --> 01:48:42.360 align:start position:0%
provision in the statute now that
 
01:48:45.169 --> 01:48:45.179 align:start position:0%
requires that the capacity for entering
 
01:48:48.470 --> 01:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
into one of these transfer on death uh
 
01:48:50.990 --> 01:48:51.000 align:start position:0%
Deeds is the same as the capacity
 
01:48:55.129 --> 01:48:55.139 align:start position:0%
required to make a will in New Hampshire
 
01:48:57.470 --> 01:48:57.480 align:start position:0%
the second protection we built in and
 
01:49:00.590 --> 01:49:00.600 align:start position:0%
this is new as of the last version is
 
01:49:03.370 --> 01:49:03.380 align:start position:0%
that we have put in a mechanism whereby
 
01:49:07.310 --> 01:49:07.320 align:start position:0%
if undue influence has occurred and if
 
01:49:10.910 --> 01:49:10.920 align:start position:0%
family members or others suspect that
 
01:49:14.149 --> 01:49:14.159 align:start position:0%
someone has been forced to sign one of
 
01:49:16.550 --> 01:49:16.560 align:start position:0%
these Deeds there's now a mechanism
 
01:49:19.729 --> 01:49:19.739 align:start position:0%
built into this statute that permits the
 
01:49:22.250 --> 01:49:22.260 align:start position:0%
interested parties to go to court within
 
01:49:25.250 --> 01:49:25.260 align:start position:0%
a specified period of time the same way
 
01:49:28.070 --> 01:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
they'd have the opportunity to contest a
 
01:49:31.790 --> 01:49:31.800 align:start position:0%
will and to make their case to the
 
01:49:34.790 --> 01:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court probate division those
 
01:49:37.310 --> 01:49:37.320 align:start position:0%
Provisions were not in the original bill
 
01:49:40.490 --> 01:49:40.500 align:start position:0%
they currently are in the new version so
 
01:49:42.590 --> 01:49:42.600 align:start position:0%
we feel that that has been addressed
 
01:49:45.709 --> 01:49:45.719 align:start position:0%
because it was a concern thank you other
 
01:49:47.510 --> 01:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative Macbeth
 
01:49:49.430 --> 01:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
01:49:51.530 --> 01:49:51.540 align:start position:0%
question and thank you for your work
 
01:49:52.970 --> 01:49:52.980 align:start position:0%
um I
 
01:49:55.189 --> 01:49:55.199 align:start position:0%
I do have a question but I also am
 
01:49:56.510 --> 01:49:56.520 align:start position:0%
curious as by what you said what
 
01:49:58.250 --> 01:49:58.260 align:start position:0%
Provisions I see there is a protection
 
01:50:00.770 --> 01:50:00.780 align:start position:0%
you said that you had added in two
 
01:50:03.649 --> 01:50:03.659 align:start position:0%
things so I see um on page four Roman
 
01:50:05.689 --> 01:50:05.699 align:start position:0%
numeral two
 
01:50:08.090 --> 01:50:08.100 align:start position:0%
um no I think it's I'm sorry could you
 
01:50:09.530 --> 01:50:09.540 align:start position:0%
reference what sections those
 
01:50:11.750 --> 01:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
preferences no it's actually on page two
 
01:50:14.570 --> 01:50:14.580 align:start position:0%
line three of the amendment
 
01:50:16.729 --> 01:50:16.739 align:start position:0%
um line five it starts talks about the
 
01:50:19.790 --> 01:50:19.800 align:start position:0%
capacity of the transfer or in the
 
01:50:21.470 --> 01:50:21.480 align:start position:0%
requirements so that's one that's
 
01:50:23.510 --> 01:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
correct and again that was in the
 
01:50:25.430 --> 01:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
original statute but we what we didn't
 
01:50:28.910 --> 01:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
have is the enforcement mechanism and
 
01:50:31.189 --> 01:50:31.199 align:start position:0%
I'm not looking at the same version that
 
01:50:33.350 --> 01:50:33.360 align:start position:0%
you're looking at but I can point you to
 
01:50:35.810 --> 01:50:35.820 align:start position:0%
the section number thank you that uh
 
01:50:39.709 --> 01:50:39.719 align:start position:0%
deals with the ability to question or or
 
01:50:42.050 --> 01:50:42.060 align:start position:0%
deal with the validity so it's now under
 
01:50:46.370 --> 01:50:46.380 align:start position:0%
uh what will be 563 D 17 the title of
 
01:50:48.830 --> 01:50:48.840 align:start position:0%
that section is validity of transfer on
 
01:50:50.169 --> 01:50:50.179 align:start position:0%
death deed
 
01:50:55.930 --> 01:50:55.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:00.290 --> 01:51:00.300 align:start position:0%
thank you okay so uh under Roman two of
 
01:51:02.510 --> 01:51:02.520 align:start position:0%
that section it says an action to
 
01:51:04.370 --> 01:51:04.380 align:start position:0%
contest the validity of a transfer under
 
01:51:05.870 --> 01:51:05.880 align:start position:0%
the deed
 
01:51:08.030 --> 01:51:08.040 align:start position:0%
etc etc must be commenced within the
 
01:51:09.950 --> 01:51:09.960 align:start position:0%
later of and so that's the provision
 
01:51:11.870 --> 01:51:11.880 align:start position:0%
that deals with the enforcement
 
01:51:14.390 --> 01:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
mechanism I think so now my question
 
01:51:17.450 --> 01:51:17.460 align:start position:0%
thank you so what I wonder is on the
 
01:51:19.370 --> 01:51:19.380 align:start position:0%
sample the statutory sample of the bill
 
01:51:22.070 --> 01:51:22.080 align:start position:0%
and the acknowledgment I know
 
01:51:24.169 --> 01:51:24.179 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering why it doesn't say there I
 
01:51:25.970 --> 01:51:25.980 align:start position:0%
know on the wills that I execute it says
 
01:51:28.430 --> 01:51:28.440 align:start position:0%
this person freely exercised and is a
 
01:51:31.310 --> 01:51:31.320 align:start position:0%
clear mind that's the that's right where
 
01:51:33.290 --> 01:51:33.300 align:start position:0%
the person that's you know the notary or
 
01:51:35.330 --> 01:51:35.340 align:start position:0%
attesting to it seems like that should
 
01:51:36.890 --> 01:51:36.900 align:start position:0%
some of that should be there shouldn't
 
01:51:38.750 --> 01:51:38.760 align:start position:0%
it well the reason we didn't put it
 
01:51:40.669 --> 01:51:40.679 align:start position:0%
there is that because this is not a will
 
01:51:45.050 --> 01:51:45.060 align:start position:0%
it is a deed and so the way this bill is
 
01:51:47.390 --> 01:51:47.400 align:start position:0%
structured and it's similar in all other
 
01:51:50.629 --> 01:51:50.639 align:start position:0%
29 states that have enacted transfer on
 
01:51:53.390 --> 01:51:53.400 align:start position:0%
death Deeds is because we're putting a
 
01:51:55.609 --> 01:51:55.619 align:start position:0%
deed on record at the registry of deeds
 
01:51:59.570 --> 01:51:59.580 align:start position:0%
and we are not drafting a will uh Wills
 
01:52:00.950 --> 01:52:00.960 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire require two
 
01:52:04.729 --> 01:52:04.739 align:start position:0%
witnesses and a notary Deeds do not and
 
01:52:06.770 --> 01:52:06.780 align:start position:0%
so we didn't want to create a situation
 
01:52:09.770 --> 01:52:09.780 align:start position:0%
here where we're taking a deed which is
 
01:52:12.770 --> 01:52:12.780 align:start position:0%
something everyone understands uh you
 
01:52:14.390 --> 01:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
know how it operates and how it needs to
 
01:52:17.330 --> 01:52:17.340 align:start position:0%
be signed and adding additional
 
01:52:20.209 --> 01:52:20.219 align:start position:0%
requirements to this particular sort of
 
01:52:22.330 --> 01:52:22.340 align:start position:0%
deed that don't
 
01:52:27.470 --> 01:52:27.480 align:start position:0%
apply to other Deeds under RSA 477. this
 
01:52:30.410 --> 01:52:30.420 align:start position:0%
is a deed it's not a will so yes one
 
01:52:33.229 --> 01:52:33.239 align:start position:0%
needs the same capacity to sign this as
 
01:52:35.510 --> 01:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
a will but it's not a will it's a
 
01:52:38.090 --> 01:52:38.100 align:start position:0%
substitute and so because this is just a
 
01:52:40.790 --> 01:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
deed it should be signed with the same
 
01:52:43.490 --> 01:52:43.500 align:start position:0%
acknowledgment and formalities of any
 
01:52:47.209 --> 01:52:47.219 align:start position:0%
other deed to be recorded under RSA 477
 
01:52:50.629 --> 01:52:50.639 align:start position:0%
so that was a deliberate design on our
 
01:52:53.510 --> 01:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
part so may I follow up yes of course so
 
01:52:56.629 --> 01:52:56.639 align:start position:0%
how are we educating I mean if you're
 
01:52:59.450 --> 01:52:59.460 align:start position:0%
notarizing this or affirming
 
01:53:01.550 --> 01:53:01.560 align:start position:0%
acknowledging it
 
01:53:03.169 --> 01:53:03.179 align:start position:0%
but you don't know if you're
 
01:53:04.609 --> 01:53:04.619 align:start position:0%
acknowledging it as you should because
 
01:53:07.070 --> 01:53:07.080 align:start position:0%
the statutory said I mean right here it
 
01:53:09.070 --> 01:53:09.080 align:start position:0%
has the statutory requirements of a will
 
01:53:11.390 --> 01:53:11.400 align:start position:0%
but you didn't put that in the
 
01:53:13.850 --> 01:53:13.860 align:start position:0%
acknowledgment so it seems inconsistent
 
01:53:15.350 --> 01:53:15.360 align:start position:0%
um and I'm worried that people that are
 
01:53:18.169 --> 01:53:18.179 align:start position:0%
you know not attorneys are familiar with
 
01:53:19.729 --> 01:53:19.739 align:start position:0%
what's the requirement when you're
 
01:53:23.810 --> 01:53:23.820 align:start position:0%
affirming it or um or acknowledging it
 
01:53:25.129 --> 01:53:25.139 align:start position:0%
you know well the answer to that
 
01:53:26.870 --> 01:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
question is that this legislation
 
01:53:28.910 --> 01:53:28.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't say that it has to be signed
 
01:53:31.910 --> 01:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
with the formalities of a will it simply
 
01:53:35.930 --> 01:53:35.940 align:start position:0%
says that the capacity required to sign
 
01:53:39.169 --> 01:53:39.179 align:start position:0%
this is the same capacity as a will so
 
01:53:41.750 --> 01:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
we've not said that the statutory
 
01:53:44.270 --> 01:53:44.280 align:start position:0%
formalities that apply to signing Wills
 
01:53:46.310 --> 01:53:46.320 align:start position:0%
apply to this deed
 
01:53:48.169 --> 01:53:48.179 align:start position:0%
so I think you're incorrect in saying
 
01:53:49.669 --> 01:53:49.679 align:start position:0%
that there could be confusion we're
 
01:53:52.070 --> 01:53:52.080 align:start position:0%
simply saying that the capacity the
 
01:53:54.229 --> 01:53:54.239 align:start position:0%
threshold for capacity for signing a
 
01:53:56.750 --> 01:53:56.760 align:start position:0%
transfer on death deed is the same as
 
01:53:58.129 --> 01:53:58.139 align:start position:0%
signing will but the statutory
 
01:54:02.990 --> 01:54:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:05.450 --> 01:54:05.460 align:start position:0%
other questions for this witness yes
 
01:54:10.010 --> 01:54:10.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:12.770 --> 01:54:12.780 align:start position:0%
if someone signs this
 
01:54:15.350 --> 01:54:15.360 align:start position:0%
and then they do a will
 
01:54:18.590 --> 01:54:18.600 align:start position:0%
or a trust
 
01:54:18.600 --> 01:54:19.850 align:start position:0%
or a trust
okay

01:54:19.850 --> 01:54:19.860 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:54:22.970 --> 01:54:22.980 align:start position:0%
what comes first what supersedes the
 
01:54:22.980 --> 01:54:23.629 align:start position:0%
what comes first what supersedes the
other

01:54:23.629 --> 01:54:23.639 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:54:29.270 --> 01:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
legally the deed will supersede because
 
01:54:33.350 --> 01:54:33.360 align:start position:0%
the deed sort of stands on its own so if
 
01:54:34.790 --> 01:54:34.800 align:start position:0%
you have one of these transfer on death
 
01:54:37.910 --> 01:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
deeds and you designate your daughter as
 
01:54:39.830 --> 01:54:39.840 align:start position:0%
the recipient of your property when you
 
01:54:42.649 --> 01:54:42.659 align:start position:0%
die and you subsequently enter into a
 
01:54:44.629 --> 01:54:44.639 align:start position:0%
trust agreement
 
01:54:47.810 --> 01:54:47.820 align:start position:0%
the deed will not be impacted by the
 
01:54:50.510 --> 01:54:50.520 align:start position:0%
trust because the property that is the
 
01:54:52.430 --> 01:54:52.440 align:start position:0%
subject of the transfer on death deed
 
01:54:55.189 --> 01:54:55.199 align:start position:0%
isn't in the trust
 
01:54:58.850 --> 01:54:58.860 align:start position:0%
one would have to sort of revoke the
 
01:55:01.850 --> 01:55:01.860 align:start position:0%
transfer on death deed by either putting
 
01:55:04.070 --> 01:55:04.080 align:start position:0%
an instrument of revocation on record at
 
01:55:06.770 --> 01:55:06.780 align:start position:0%
the registry of deeds saying I revoke my
 
01:55:09.229 --> 01:55:09.239 align:start position:0%
prior designation to my daughter
 
01:55:11.390 --> 01:55:11.400 align:start position:0%
or one would have to take that property
 
01:55:14.810 --> 01:55:14.820 align:start position:0%
and transfer it into the trust to revoke
 
01:55:16.490 --> 01:55:16.500 align:start position:0%
the transfer on death deed but the
 
01:55:19.070 --> 01:55:19.080 align:start position:0%
trance around death deed would Trump any
 
01:55:22.490 --> 01:55:22.500 align:start position:0%
later instrument that doesn't actually
 
01:55:25.729 --> 01:55:25.739 align:start position:0%
revoke the transfer on death deed follow
 
01:55:27.109 --> 01:55:27.119 align:start position:0%
up yes
 
01:55:29.930 --> 01:55:29.940 align:start position:0%
what if you already have a trust and a
 
01:55:29.940 --> 01:55:31.010 align:start position:0%
what if you already have a trust and a
will

01:55:31.010 --> 01:55:31.020 align:start position:0%
will
 
01:55:34.010 --> 01:55:34.020 align:start position:0%
and you have a trust that your property
 
01:55:36.530 --> 01:55:36.540 align:start position:0%
is in or will that your property is in
 
01:55:38.930 --> 01:55:38.940 align:start position:0%
but you want to do this
 
01:55:41.570 --> 01:55:41.580 align:start position:0%
you can and so let's just take the
 
01:55:43.609 --> 01:55:43.619 align:start position:0%
example that you provided you have a
 
01:55:46.609 --> 01:55:46.619 align:start position:0%
trust your primary residences in that
 
01:55:49.669 --> 01:55:49.679 align:start position:0%
trust and you decide that instead of
 
01:55:52.250 --> 01:55:52.260 align:start position:0%
having the trust dictate how your
 
01:55:53.870 --> 01:55:53.880 align:start position:0%
primary residence is going to be
 
01:55:55.970 --> 01:55:55.980 align:start position:0%
distributed at death you want to pull
 
01:55:57.709 --> 01:55:57.719 align:start position:0%
that property out of the trust and give
 
01:56:01.430 --> 01:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
it to someone else you simply execute a
 
01:56:02.590 --> 01:56:02.600 align:start position:0%
new deed
 
01:56:05.330 --> 01:56:05.340 align:start position:0%
transferring the property out of the
 
01:56:05.340 --> 01:56:06.350 align:start position:0%
transferring the property out of the
trust

01:56:06.350 --> 01:56:06.360 align:start position:0%
trust
 
01:56:09.229 --> 01:56:09.239 align:start position:0%
and designating it via one of these
 
01:56:11.750 --> 01:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
transfer on death Deeds to that other
 
01:56:11.760 --> 01:56:13.550 align:start position:0%
transfer on death Deeds to that other
person

01:56:13.550 --> 01:56:13.560 align:start position:0%
person
 
01:56:16.490 --> 01:56:16.500 align:start position:0%
other questions representative
 
01:56:18.590 --> 01:56:18.600 align:start position:0%
uh yeah thanks Mr chair and thanks for
 
01:56:19.609 --> 01:56:19.619 align:start position:0%
taking the question
 
01:56:21.770 --> 01:56:21.780 align:start position:0%
um I specifically and again this is this
 
01:56:23.689 --> 01:56:23.699 align:start position:0%
is apologies for not understanding the
 
01:56:26.450 --> 01:56:26.460 align:start position:0%
legal language here you had mentioned in
 
01:56:28.189 --> 01:56:28.199 align:start position:0%
your original testimony
 
01:56:30.770 --> 01:56:30.780 align:start position:0%
an issue with title companies not being
 
01:56:33.830 --> 01:56:33.840 align:start position:0%
willing to to take these because
 
01:56:36.410 --> 01:56:36.420 align:start position:0%
um of technical requirements and the the
 
01:56:38.689 --> 01:56:38.699 align:start position:0%
register of deeds for my County also
 
01:56:41.149 --> 01:56:41.159 align:start position:0%
made a same point and I couldn't reading
 
01:56:43.609 --> 01:56:43.619 align:start position:0%
this see what has been changed in order
 
01:56:44.990 --> 01:56:45.000 align:start position:0%
to fix that and I was wondering if you
 
01:56:46.910 --> 01:56:46.920 align:start position:0%
could just explain well let me deal with
 
01:56:49.850 --> 01:56:49.860 align:start position:0%
the registry of deeds issue first I
 
01:56:53.570 --> 01:56:53.580 align:start position:0%
actually sent a copy of our edits to the
 
01:56:55.129 --> 01:56:55.139 align:start position:0%
register of deeds who was here
 
01:56:57.709 --> 01:56:57.719 align:start position:0%
testifying with some concerns about the
 
01:56:58.790 --> 01:56:58.800 align:start position:0%
prior bill
 
01:57:01.669 --> 01:57:01.679 align:start position:0%
she looked to this over and gave it the
 
01:57:03.470 --> 01:57:03.480 align:start position:0%
green light and said we had addressed
 
01:57:06.050 --> 01:57:06.060 align:start position:0%
her issues her issue really surrounded
 
01:57:09.229 --> 01:57:09.239 align:start position:0%
around notice and making sure that when
 
01:57:11.510 --> 01:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
the death occurs and there's one of
 
01:57:13.930 --> 01:57:13.940 align:start position:0%
these transfer on death Deeds on record
 
01:57:17.030 --> 01:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
that the decedent's death certificate
 
01:57:20.270 --> 01:57:20.280 align:start position:0%
actually gets recorded at the registry
 
01:57:23.330 --> 01:57:23.340 align:start position:0%
of deeds that's what causes the transfer
 
01:57:26.089 --> 01:57:26.099 align:start position:0%
to occur and so there's a requirement in
 
01:57:28.669 --> 01:57:28.679 align:start position:0%
the statute that says that once a
 
01:57:31.010 --> 01:57:31.020 align:start position:0%
decedent dies having one of these
 
01:57:32.570 --> 01:57:32.580 align:start position:0%
transformative death Deeds on record
 
01:57:35.030 --> 01:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
that person's death certificate has to
 
01:57:38.450 --> 01:57:38.460 align:start position:0%
be recorded in every County in which
 
01:57:41.089 --> 01:57:41.099 align:start position:0%
Real Estate that's being transferred via
 
01:57:44.810 --> 01:57:44.820 align:start position:0%
this deed is located so that's sufficed
 
01:57:47.089 --> 01:57:47.099 align:start position:0%
to deal with her concerns
 
01:57:49.070 --> 01:57:49.080 align:start position:0%
the issue of title companies is a little
 
01:57:52.010 --> 01:57:52.020 align:start position:0%
bit trickier in the sense that from the
 
01:57:54.890 --> 01:57:54.900 align:start position:0%
outset the precursor to this bill which
 
01:57:58.550 --> 01:57:58.560 align:start position:0%
I believe was Senate Bill 243 was
 
01:58:00.589 --> 01:58:00.599 align:start position:0%
something that caused title companies a
 
01:58:02.570 --> 01:58:02.580 align:start position:0%
significant amount of heartburn
 
01:58:04.370 --> 01:58:04.380 align:start position:0%
and when we were working as a
 
01:58:07.250 --> 01:58:07.260 align:start position:0%
legislative group with title companies
 
01:58:11.629 --> 01:58:11.639 align:start position:0%
to address SB 243 we received input from
 
01:58:13.310 --> 01:58:13.320 align:start position:0%
the title companies and had addressed
 
01:58:14.810 --> 01:58:14.820 align:start position:0%
some of their concerns
 
01:58:18.169 --> 01:58:18.179 align:start position:0%
in the meantime House Bill 68 came down
 
01:58:19.910 --> 01:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
the pike and it was quite a bit
 
01:58:22.129 --> 01:58:22.139 align:start position:0%
different from the original Senate bill
 
01:58:22.139 --> 01:58:23.870 align:start position:0%
different from the original Senate bill
243.

01:58:23.870 --> 01:58:23.880 align:start position:0%
243.
 
01:58:26.689 --> 01:58:26.699 align:start position:0%
we invited the title companies to join
 
01:58:29.209 --> 01:58:29.219 align:start position:0%
with us and to work on this draft
 
01:58:32.990 --> 01:58:33.000 align:start position:0%
legislation we provided our contacts at
 
01:58:34.729 --> 01:58:34.739 align:start position:0%
the title insurance companies with
 
01:58:37.330 --> 01:58:37.340 align:start position:0%
copies of our revisions as we went along
 
01:58:41.149 --> 01:58:41.159 align:start position:0%
uh and to our surprise we really didn't
 
01:58:44.689 --> 01:58:44.699 align:start position:0%
get any further input from the title
 
01:58:47.089 --> 01:58:47.099 align:start position:0%
companies so they were invited to work
 
01:58:49.790 --> 01:58:49.800 align:start position:0%
with us to draft this statute I'm
 
01:58:52.129 --> 01:58:52.139 align:start position:0%
disappointed to say that they didn't
 
01:58:54.229 --> 01:58:54.239 align:start position:0%
join us in this effort and so I really
 
01:58:56.930 --> 01:58:56.940 align:start position:0%
can't speak to whether or not they have
 
01:58:59.810 --> 01:58:59.820 align:start position:0%
any continuing concerns I simply didn't
 
01:59:02.089 --> 01:59:02.099 align:start position:0%
hear back from them
 
01:59:04.189 --> 01:59:04.199 align:start position:0%
just one quick follow-up was there a
 
01:59:06.229 --> 01:59:06.239 align:start position:0%
specific section of this that that you
 
01:59:08.089 --> 01:59:08.099 align:start position:0%
know to be the the sticking point for
 
01:59:08.099 --> 01:59:09.290 align:start position:0%
know to be the the sticking point for
them

01:59:09.290 --> 01:59:09.300 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:59:12.709 --> 01:59:12.719 align:start position:0%
no uh the general comment I received was
 
01:59:15.410 --> 01:59:15.420 align:start position:0%
from a woman at a local title company
 
01:59:18.530 --> 01:59:18.540 align:start position:0%
here who also underwrites in Maine Maine
 
01:59:20.810 --> 01:59:20.820 align:start position:0%
has had a transfer on death deed statute
 
01:59:22.850 --> 01:59:22.860 align:start position:0%
now for several years
 
01:59:26.089 --> 01:59:26.099 align:start position:0%
and what she recited to me was that in
 
01:59:29.030 --> 01:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
general because of the potential for
 
01:59:32.209 --> 01:59:32.219 align:start position:0%
creditor claims so in other words under
 
01:59:34.070 --> 01:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
every version of a transfer on death
 
01:59:36.649 --> 01:59:36.659 align:start position:0%
deed statute if you die with property
 
01:59:38.629 --> 01:59:38.639 align:start position:0%
and you transfer it via one of these
 
01:59:40.790 --> 01:59:40.800 align:start position:0%
Deeds to say your kid and the property
 
01:59:44.030 --> 01:59:44.040 align:start position:0%
is mortgaged the mortgage follows the
 
01:59:46.010 --> 01:59:46.020 align:start position:0%
property and so the person who inherits
 
01:59:49.010 --> 01:59:49.020 align:start position:0%
the property inherits it subject to that
 
01:59:51.350 --> 01:59:51.360 align:start position:0%
debt or any other encumbrances
 
01:59:53.750 --> 01:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
the existence of that mortgage and that
 
01:59:56.570 --> 01:59:56.580 align:start position:0%
encumbrance causes problems for title
 
01:59:59.450 --> 01:59:59.460 align:start position:0%
companies so it was in the context of
 
02:00:02.149 --> 02:00:02.159 align:start position:0%
encumbered property that the title
 
02:00:05.030 --> 02:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
companies were concerned because if the
 
02:00:07.430 --> 02:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
person who inherits the property then
 
02:00:09.950 --> 02:00:09.960 align:start position:0%
ultimately tries to convey it to someone
 
02:00:12.410 --> 02:00:12.420 align:start position:0%
else there's a question as to whether or
 
02:00:15.649 --> 02:00:15.659 align:start position:0%
not the the title there is good that a
 
02:00:17.870 --> 02:00:17.880 align:start position:0%
warranty deed can issue
 
02:00:20.149 --> 02:00:20.159 align:start position:0%
we think we've resolved that issue here
 
02:00:22.550 --> 02:00:22.560 align:start position:0%
by simply saying that if you convey
 
02:00:24.770 --> 02:00:24.780 align:start position:0%
property versus be a transfer on death
 
02:00:28.609 --> 02:00:28.619 align:start position:0%
deed it comes with no warranties
 
02:00:31.910 --> 02:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
you get it subject to all encumbrances
 
02:00:34.310 --> 02:00:34.320 align:start position:0%
and creditor claims even if you were to
 
02:00:35.990 --> 02:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
make the mistake in drafting the deed
 
02:00:37.669 --> 02:00:37.679 align:start position:0%
saying this comes with warranty
 
02:00:41.510 --> 02:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
covenants it simply doesn't so to the
 
02:00:43.609 --> 02:00:43.619 align:start position:0%
extent the title companies are concerned
 
02:00:46.510 --> 02:00:46.520 align:start position:0%
that they'll somehow have to underwrite
 
02:00:49.570 --> 02:00:49.580 align:start position:0%
policies on these transform death Deeds
 
02:00:52.010 --> 02:00:52.020 align:start position:0%
we've made it easier than for them to do
 
02:00:54.530 --> 02:00:54.540 align:start position:0%
that because there's no liability
 
02:00:58.250 --> 02:00:58.260 align:start position:0%
attached to a a deed that comes you know
 
02:01:00.589 --> 02:01:00.599 align:start position:0%
for on property that is fully encumbered
 
02:01:03.109 --> 02:01:03.119 align:start position:0%
you can't convey this via warranty deed
 
02:01:07.070 --> 02:01:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:08.810 --> 02:01:08.820 align:start position:0%
other questions yes representative
 
02:01:13.010 --> 02:01:13.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:13.020 --> 02:01:14.450 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:01:14.450 --> 02:01:14.460 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:01:17.089 --> 02:01:17.099 align:start position:0%
um I'm looking on page four it's section
 
02:01:23.030 --> 02:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
it's V five let me see um D14
 
02:01:25.189 --> 02:01:25.199 align:start position:0%
it's line number 14 it says property
 
02:01:26.930 --> 02:01:26.940 align:start position:0%
conveyed by transfer death shall not be
 
02:01:28.250 --> 02:01:28.260 align:start position:0%
considered as part of the probate estate
 
02:01:30.290 --> 02:01:30.300 align:start position:0%
for the of The spouse's right so does
 
02:01:33.050 --> 02:01:33.060 align:start position:0%
that do away with the homestead um
 
02:01:35.270 --> 02:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
it does it does not it does this bill
 
02:01:37.609 --> 02:01:37.619 align:start position:0%
does not impact Homestead rights which
 
02:01:39.770 --> 02:01:39.780 align:start position:0%
you know if you're an attorney have
 
02:01:42.770 --> 02:01:42.780 align:start position:0%
worked in this area Homestead issues are
 
02:01:44.750 --> 02:01:44.760 align:start position:0%
totally nebulous and it's very hard to
 
02:01:46.669 --> 02:01:46.679 align:start position:0%
get your head around what that actually
 
02:01:48.770 --> 02:01:48.780 align:start position:0%
means as a surviving spouse or in a
 
02:01:51.290 --> 02:01:51.300 align:start position:0%
bankruptcy context so uh this bill
 
02:01:54.050 --> 02:01:54.060 align:start position:0%
doesn't upset or deal with homestead in
 
02:01:55.490 --> 02:01:55.500 align:start position:0%
any way
 
02:01:58.189 --> 02:01:58.199 align:start position:0%
um all it does is allow you to transfer
 
02:02:00.470 --> 02:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
that deed and not have it subject to
 
02:02:02.570 --> 02:02:02.580 align:start position:0%
What's called the spousal elective share
 
02:02:04.609 --> 02:02:04.619 align:start position:0%
in other words we're taking probate
 
02:02:07.129 --> 02:02:07.139 align:start position:0%
Concepts and with separating them away
 
02:02:10.070 --> 02:02:10.080 align:start position:0%
from Real Estate Concepts here so we
 
02:02:12.229 --> 02:02:12.239 align:start position:0%
don't have people making claims in
 
02:02:15.890 --> 02:02:15.900 align:start position:0%
Probate Court on property that has gone
 
02:02:17.870 --> 02:02:17.880 align:start position:0%
out the door via transfer on death Deed
 
02:02:20.330 --> 02:02:20.340 align:start position:0%
by virtue of the spousal election or the
 
02:02:22.550 --> 02:02:22.560 align:start position:0%
pretermitted air statute
 
02:02:24.830 --> 02:02:24.840 align:start position:0%
other questions could she explain the
 
02:02:26.810 --> 02:02:26.820 align:start position:0%
spousal elective share and what that
 
02:02:28.129 --> 02:02:28.139 align:start position:0%
does to the spouse that now that we're
 
02:02:30.109 --> 02:02:30.119 align:start position:0%
eliminating that yes so we're not
 
02:02:32.570 --> 02:02:32.580 align:start position:0%
eliminating spouse well you just said
 
02:02:34.129 --> 02:02:34.139 align:start position:0%
you're eliminating the elective share so
 
02:02:36.290 --> 02:02:36.300 align:start position:0%
elective shares could you explain that
 
02:02:39.830 --> 02:02:39.840 align:start position:0%
absolutely so under New Hampshire law
 
02:02:43.070 --> 02:02:43.080 align:start position:0%
um the general rule is that as a person
 
02:02:44.750 --> 02:02:44.760 align:start position:0%
as a decedent you have the right to
 
02:02:46.430 --> 02:02:46.440 align:start position:0%
convey your property to anyone you want
 
02:02:49.070 --> 02:02:49.080 align:start position:0%
and if you happen to be married at the
 
02:02:51.470 --> 02:02:51.480 align:start position:0%
time of your death and your will leaves
 
02:02:55.070 --> 02:02:55.080 align:start position:0%
nothing to your surviving spouse then
 
02:02:56.689 --> 02:02:56.699 align:start position:0%
that surviving spouse who has been
 
02:03:00.169 --> 02:03:00.179 align:start position:0%
completely cut out of your will has the
 
02:03:02.270 --> 02:03:02.280 align:start position:0%
right to go into probate court and
 
02:03:04.129 --> 02:03:04.139 align:start position:0%
demand what's called an elective share
 
02:03:06.530 --> 02:03:06.540 align:start position:0%
and under New Hampshire law that
 
02:03:09.470 --> 02:03:09.480 align:start position:0%
elective share amount is one-third
 
02:03:11.810 --> 02:03:11.820 align:start position:0%
and so the general notion in New
 
02:03:14.589 --> 02:03:14.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is that spouses can freely
 
02:03:17.689 --> 02:03:17.699 align:start position:0%
disinherit one another but the center
 
02:03:20.450 --> 02:03:20.460 align:start position:0%
tax accidental or that the receiver the
 
02:03:22.370 --> 02:03:22.380 align:start position:0%
surviving spouse doesn't like the fact
 
02:03:24.229 --> 02:03:24.239 align:start position:0%
that he or she has been disinherited
 
02:03:27.649 --> 02:03:27.659 align:start position:0%
that person has the right to redress in
 
02:03:29.689 --> 02:03:29.699 align:start position:0%
the probate court by at least grabbing
 
02:03:32.810 --> 02:03:32.820 align:start position:0%
one-third of the probate assets
 
02:03:37.129 --> 02:03:37.139 align:start position:0%
cause this is a non-probate transfer
 
02:03:39.950 --> 02:03:39.960 align:start position:0%
it's it's the same as taking your bank
 
02:03:42.109 --> 02:03:42.119 align:start position:0%
account and putting a beneficiary in
 
02:03:44.570 --> 02:03:44.580 align:start position:0%
your bank account you drop dead your
 
02:03:46.310 --> 02:03:46.320 align:start position:0%
kid's name is on the benefit on the bank
 
02:03:48.410 --> 02:03:48.420 align:start position:0%
account that kid walks into the bank
 
02:03:50.510 --> 02:03:50.520 align:start position:0%
with your death certificate and the bank
 
02:03:53.149 --> 02:03:53.159 align:start position:0%
hands your child the money this is what
 
02:03:55.129 --> 02:03:55.139 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do with real estate the
 
02:03:56.330 --> 02:03:56.340 align:start position:0%
same thing that people have been doing
 
02:03:58.970 --> 02:03:58.980 align:start position:0%
for decades with their 401ks and
 
02:04:00.470 --> 02:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
everything else
 
02:04:03.050 --> 02:04:03.060 align:start position:0%
a bank account is not subject to the
 
02:04:04.910 --> 02:04:04.920 align:start position:0%
elective share
 
02:04:08.149 --> 02:04:08.159 align:start position:0%
a 401k well let's let's not go there
 
02:04:09.470 --> 02:04:09.480 align:start position:0%
because that's subject to Federal rules
 
02:04:12.830 --> 02:04:12.840 align:start position:0%
that don't apply ah a bank account is
 
02:04:14.930 --> 02:04:14.940 align:start position:0%
not subject to the elective share so if
 
02:04:16.609 --> 02:04:16.619 align:start position:0%
I die married
 
02:04:20.209 --> 02:04:20.219 align:start position:0%
and I don't have my spouse on my bank
 
02:04:22.970 --> 02:04:22.980 align:start position:0%
account and I instead name a child as
 
02:04:25.490 --> 02:04:25.500 align:start position:0%
the recipient my spouse cannot claim a
 
02:04:26.930 --> 02:04:26.940 align:start position:0%
one-third share of that bank account
 
02:04:28.850 --> 02:04:28.860 align:start position:0%
it's not subject to the elective share
 
02:04:30.770 --> 02:04:30.780 align:start position:0%
because the bank account is not a
 
02:04:33.229 --> 02:04:33.239 align:start position:0%
probate asset so in answer to your
 
02:04:34.729 --> 02:04:34.739 align:start position:0%
question what we've done with the
 
02:04:36.890 --> 02:04:36.900 align:start position:0%
transfer on death deed statute because
 
02:04:40.070 --> 02:04:40.080 align:start position:0%
we want real estate transfers via
 
02:04:42.649 --> 02:04:42.659 align:start position:0%
transfer on death designation to operate
 
02:04:45.709 --> 02:04:45.719 align:start position:0%
the same way that Financial transactions
 
02:04:48.649 --> 02:04:48.659 align:start position:0%
do at the bank is that we have made the
 
02:04:52.550 --> 02:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
transfer on death deed statute not part
 
02:04:55.250 --> 02:04:55.260 align:start position:0%
of the one-third elective share that you
 
02:04:58.070 --> 02:04:58.080 align:start position:0%
can elect again against if you are a
 
02:05:00.350 --> 02:05:00.360 align:start position:0%
spouse who has not been left anything
 
02:05:03.649 --> 02:05:03.659 align:start position:0%
so may I follow up yes so you people
 
02:05:05.330 --> 02:05:05.340 align:start position:0%
been married for 50 years second
 
02:05:06.649 --> 02:05:06.659 align:start position:0%
marriage children from the first
 
02:05:08.629 --> 02:05:08.639 align:start position:0%
marriage get the dad who the name the
 
02:05:11.089 --> 02:05:11.099 align:start position:0%
house is in the dad's name he dies he
 
02:05:13.669 --> 02:05:13.679 align:start position:0%
signed the deed the stepmother who's
 
02:05:15.410 --> 02:05:15.420 align:start position:0%
been married for 40 years she's evicted
 
02:05:17.750 --> 02:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
from the house and
 
02:05:19.189 --> 02:05:19.199 align:start position:0%
that there's nothing she can do she
 
02:05:21.290 --> 02:05:21.300 align:start position:0%
can't claim her elective share
 
02:05:24.290 --> 02:05:24.300 align:start position:0%
only that is correct but you are
 
02:05:27.709 --> 02:05:27.719 align:start position:0%
presuming that the husband that the wife
 
02:05:29.629 --> 02:05:29.639 align:start position:0%
in this situation is under already a
 
02:05:31.310 --> 02:05:31.320 align:start position:0%
joint owner on the deet
 
02:05:34.850 --> 02:05:34.860 align:start position:0%
if she is then that doesn't happen but
 
02:05:36.649 --> 02:05:36.659 align:start position:0%
in this instance and and I see this
 
02:05:38.870 --> 02:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
often in my practice in in second or
 
02:05:41.870 --> 02:05:41.880 align:start position:0%
third marriage situations where a spouse
 
02:05:44.030 --> 02:05:44.040 align:start position:0%
you know will pick on the husband here
 
02:05:46.250 --> 02:05:46.260 align:start position:0%
so the husband remarries
 
02:05:50.089 --> 02:05:50.099 align:start position:0%
he owns property in his own name and he
 
02:05:52.070 --> 02:05:52.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't want his second spouse his third
 
02:05:55.070 --> 02:05:55.080 align:start position:0%
spouse his fourth spouse to get that
 
02:05:56.930 --> 02:05:56.940 align:start position:0%
property when he dies he wants to pass
 
02:05:59.810 --> 02:05:59.820 align:start position:0%
it to his children he can do that via
 
02:06:01.490 --> 02:06:01.500 align:start position:0%
the transfer on death statute
 
02:06:05.930 --> 02:06:05.940 align:start position:0%
if however our husband has added wife
 
02:06:07.970 --> 02:06:07.980 align:start position:0%
number two wife number three wife number
 
02:06:11.270 --> 02:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
four whoever she is as a joint owner on
 
02:06:12.350 --> 02:06:12.360 align:start position:0%
the property
 
02:06:16.430 --> 02:06:16.440 align:start position:0%
then that surviving spouse the wife will
 
02:06:18.830 --> 02:06:18.840 align:start position:0%
take when the husband dies because she's
 
02:06:21.410 --> 02:06:21.420 align:start position:0%
already a joint owner on the property
 
02:06:24.589 --> 02:06:24.599 align:start position:0%
and if she survives him then she's in
 
02:06:26.750 --> 02:06:26.760 align:start position:0%
control of the property and she can
 
02:06:28.850 --> 02:06:28.860 align:start position:0%
distribute it the way she wants to do
 
02:06:31.129 --> 02:06:31.139 align:start position:0%
that so just one more question I'm going
 
02:06:32.750 --> 02:06:32.760 align:start position:0%
back to this acknowledgment would you
 
02:06:34.790 --> 02:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
consider adding into the acknowledgment
 
02:06:38.030 --> 02:06:38.040 align:start position:0%
that acknowledged before me in
 
02:06:41.990 --> 02:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
accordance with the RSA that says it has
 
02:06:44.930 --> 02:06:44.940 align:start position:0%
to you know it has the capacity of a
 
02:06:46.790 --> 02:06:46.800 align:start position:0%
will because I'm still concerned about
 
02:06:49.250 --> 02:06:49.260 align:start position:0%
this when I sit down to a document to
 
02:06:51.770 --> 02:06:51.780 align:start position:0%
acknowledge it if I'm just being a a
 
02:06:54.229 --> 02:06:54.239 align:start position:0%
notary or Justice of the piece I follow
 
02:06:55.970 --> 02:06:55.980 align:start position:0%
exactly what the instrument says and if
 
02:06:57.350 --> 02:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
it just says acknowledge it then I just
 
02:06:59.149 --> 02:06:59.159 align:start position:0%
make sure it's the person I don't ask
 
02:07:00.890 --> 02:07:00.900 align:start position:0%
the other questions so I'm concerned
 
02:07:02.570 --> 02:07:02.580 align:start position:0%
that people might be acknowledging this
 
02:07:05.450 --> 02:07:05.460 align:start position:0%
based on what the document itself says
 
02:07:08.209 --> 02:07:08.219 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't refer back to really what
 
02:07:10.250 --> 02:07:10.260 align:start position:0%
that you have to check on capacity Free
 
02:07:11.570 --> 02:07:11.580 align:start position:0%
Will whatever
 
02:07:13.430 --> 02:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
so would you consider an amendment that
 
02:07:15.350 --> 02:07:15.360 align:start position:0%
would at least add so it's not changing
 
02:07:17.390 --> 02:07:17.400 align:start position:0%
and making standard but it says you know
 
02:07:19.310 --> 02:07:19.320 align:start position:0%
acknowledging it in accordance with you
 
02:07:20.530 --> 02:07:20.540 align:start position:0%
know RSA
 
02:07:23.270 --> 02:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
563 I don't think I'd be comfortable
 
02:07:25.550 --> 02:07:25.560 align:start position:0%
doing that for the following reason you
 
02:07:28.930 --> 02:07:28.940 align:start position:0%
and I are attorneys we understand what
 
02:07:31.970 --> 02:07:31.980 align:start position:0%
capacity is in terms of signing a will
 
02:07:35.450 --> 02:07:35.460 align:start position:0%
the whole purpose of this transformed
 
02:07:37.490 --> 02:07:37.500 align:start position:0%
death is indeed statute is to make sure
 
02:07:40.790 --> 02:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
that people don't have to hire an
 
02:07:40.800 --> 02:07:41.750 align:start position:0%
that people don't have to hire an
attorney

02:07:41.750 --> 02:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
attorney
 
02:07:44.030 --> 02:07:44.040 align:start position:0%
to convey their property
 
02:07:44.040 --> 02:07:44.629 align:start position:0%
to convey their property
um

02:07:44.629 --> 02:07:44.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:47.089 --> 02:07:47.099 align:start position:0%
so and the other thing is that there's a
 
02:07:50.030 --> 02:07:50.040 align:start position:0%
cross-reference here to RSA 477 and
 
02:07:52.729 --> 02:07:52.739 align:start position:0%
again this is a deed and so if the idea
 
02:07:55.729 --> 02:07:55.739 align:start position:0%
here is that a transfer on death deed
 
02:07:55.739 --> 02:07:56.410 align:start position:0%
here is that a transfer on death deed
um

02:07:56.410 --> 02:07:56.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:59.990 --> 02:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
looks and and otherwise walks and talks
 
02:08:02.510 --> 02:08:02.520 align:start position:0%
like any other deed
 
02:08:05.149 --> 02:08:05.159 align:start position:0%
then adding an additional requirement
 
02:08:08.149 --> 02:08:08.159 align:start position:0%
that refers to the capacity
 
02:08:10.970 --> 02:08:10.980 align:start position:0%
uh requires us to then make other
 
02:08:14.990 --> 02:08:15.000 align:start position:0%
changes to RSA 477 and then it's not a
 
02:08:16.310 --> 02:08:16.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire deed that looks like any
 
02:08:18.470 --> 02:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
other New Hampshire deed so I just have
 
02:08:20.030 --> 02:08:20.040 align:start position:0%
to clarify so you just said we don't
 
02:08:21.709 --> 02:08:21.719 align:start position:0%
want to put a reference to a statute
 
02:08:23.149 --> 02:08:23.159 align:start position:0%
because the person that's acknowledging
 
02:08:24.890 --> 02:08:24.900 align:start position:0%
it may not be able to interpret the
 
02:08:26.990 --> 02:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
statute and be able to say that the
 
02:08:29.270 --> 02:08:29.280 align:start position:0%
person's has capacity but they're
 
02:08:31.129 --> 02:08:31.139 align:start position:0%
acknowledging this document I mean that
 
02:08:33.350 --> 02:08:33.360 align:start position:0%
makes no sense you know what I'm sorry I
 
02:08:34.669 --> 02:08:34.679 align:start position:0%
I mean it seems like we're kind of
 
02:08:36.169 --> 02:08:36.179 align:start position:0%
getting into debate as opposed to
 
02:08:38.149 --> 02:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
questions and I'm not I'm not sure that
 
02:08:39.770 --> 02:08:39.780 align:start position:0%
that really is helpful
 
02:08:41.930 --> 02:08:41.940 align:start position:0%
um are there other questions for this
 
02:08:44.629 --> 02:08:44.639 align:start position:0%
witness yes representative Manos
 
02:08:46.609 --> 02:08:46.619 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
02:08:48.050 --> 02:08:48.060 align:start position:0%
um I want I wanted to ask a question
 
02:08:51.109 --> 02:08:51.119 align:start position:0%
about capacity also and the question of
 
02:08:54.350 --> 02:08:54.360 align:start position:0%
that representative Perez raised the
 
02:08:56.330 --> 02:08:56.340 align:start position:0%
question of person a person having
 
02:08:58.970 --> 02:08:58.980 align:start position:0%
capacity at one point in time to do the
 
02:09:02.330 --> 02:09:02.340 align:start position:0%
the deed and then subsequently later
 
02:09:06.649 --> 02:09:06.659 align:start position:0%
their their capacity changes and you
 
02:09:08.510 --> 02:09:08.520 align:start position:0%
would need it's a question but wouldn't
 
02:09:10.669 --> 02:09:10.679 align:start position:0%
you need a power of attorney at that
 
02:09:12.709 --> 02:09:12.719 align:start position:0%
point if there were going to be a
 
02:09:14.990 --> 02:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
subsequent change
 
02:09:19.310 --> 02:09:19.320 align:start position:0%
um let's say the daughter knows that her
 
02:09:22.070 --> 02:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
mother would want to change it
 
02:09:24.109 --> 02:09:24.119 align:start position:0%
so you would need a power of attorney at
 
02:09:25.910 --> 02:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
that point would you not to make a
 
02:09:27.530 --> 02:09:27.540 align:start position:0%
subsequent change when there's lack of
 
02:09:30.109 --> 02:09:30.119 align:start position:0%
capacity yes and you actually need more
 
02:09:31.850 --> 02:09:31.860 align:start position:0%
than just a power of attorney and that
 
02:09:33.470 --> 02:09:33.480 align:start position:0%
is one of the issues that we addressed
 
02:09:38.089 --> 02:09:38.099 align:start position:0%
when we made revisions to hb68 so our
 
02:09:40.370 --> 02:09:40.380 align:start position:0%
initially we questioned as a drafting
 
02:09:43.010 --> 02:09:43.020 align:start position:0%
group whether or not someone who holds a
 
02:09:44.450 --> 02:09:44.460 align:start position:0%
power of attorney should have the
 
02:09:47.510 --> 02:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
authority to convey property on behalf
 
02:09:49.970 --> 02:09:49.980 align:start position:0%
of an incapacitated person via one of
 
02:09:52.370 --> 02:09:52.380 align:start position:0%
these transfer and death Deeds and what
 
02:09:55.370 --> 02:09:55.380 align:start position:0%
we ultimately uh agreed to and and
 
02:09:57.350 --> 02:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
determined would be you know fair and
 
02:09:59.930 --> 02:09:59.940 align:start position:0%
Equitable is to put a provision in this
 
02:10:02.390 --> 02:10:02.400 align:start position:0%
bill that specifically allows the holder
 
02:10:04.669 --> 02:10:04.679 align:start position:0%
or an agent under a power of attorney to
 
02:10:06.470 --> 02:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
engage in one of these transactions
 
02:10:09.109 --> 02:10:09.119 align:start position:0%
subject to all of the normal fiduciary
 
02:10:11.629 --> 02:10:11.639 align:start position:0%
duties that apply to every transaction
 
02:10:14.629 --> 02:10:14.639 align:start position:0%
that an agent enters into under a power
 
02:10:17.450 --> 02:10:17.460 align:start position:0%
of attorney and also subject to the
 
02:10:20.030 --> 02:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
further requirement that the durable
 
02:10:23.149 --> 02:10:23.159 align:start position:0%
power of attorney specifically authorize
 
02:10:26.330 --> 02:10:26.340 align:start position:0%
that agent to make changes to
 
02:10:29.750 --> 02:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
beneficiary designations so if the
 
02:10:31.790 --> 02:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
mother in your example has a durable
 
02:10:34.010 --> 02:10:34.020 align:start position:0%
power of attorney that specifically
 
02:10:36.709 --> 02:10:36.719 align:start position:0%
allows the agent to change beneficiary
 
02:10:39.649 --> 02:10:39.659 align:start position:0%
designations then that language would
 
02:10:42.350 --> 02:10:42.360 align:start position:0%
permit that daughter to engage in one of
 
02:10:44.030 --> 02:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
these transactions on her mother's
 
02:10:44.040 --> 02:10:45.169 align:start position:0%
these transactions on her mother's
behalf

02:10:45.169 --> 02:10:45.179 align:start position:0%
behalf
 
02:10:47.510 --> 02:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
other questions for this Witness
 
02:10:51.229 --> 02:10:51.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:54.169 --> 02:10:54.179 align:start position:0%
another day yet I'm not an expert on the
 
02:10:56.270 --> 02:10:56.280 align:start position:0%
definition of a person but a few years
 
02:10:58.970 --> 02:10:58.980 align:start position:0%
ago and it was on an unrelated area of
 
02:11:00.050 --> 02:11:00.060 align:start position:0%
the law
 
02:11:02.330 --> 02:11:02.340 align:start position:0%
I discovered that um well it was
 
02:11:04.850 --> 02:11:04.860 align:start position:0%
interference with custody which turned
 
02:11:06.290 --> 02:11:06.300 align:start position:0%
out the interferency custody law didn't
 
02:11:07.310 --> 02:11:07.320 align:start position:0%
cover the case where someone was
 
02:11:10.250 --> 02:11:10.260 align:start position:0%
interviewing with custody of the dcyf
 
02:11:12.169 --> 02:11:12.179 align:start position:0%
because the dcya that's not a person I
 
02:11:13.370 --> 02:11:13.380 align:start position:0%
know there's going to be a question here
 
02:11:15.350 --> 02:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
thank you yes sir this is a definition
 
02:11:17.030 --> 02:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
of person which includes government
 
02:11:18.890 --> 02:11:18.900 align:start position:0%
agencies but I know
 
02:11:21.129 --> 02:11:21.139 align:start position:0%
in other areas of the law
 
02:11:23.810 --> 02:11:23.820 align:start position:0%
government agencies are not considered
 
02:11:25.910 --> 02:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
persons so is that
 
02:11:27.530 --> 02:11:27.540 align:start position:0%
is that something that maybe we need to
 
02:11:30.290 --> 02:11:30.300 align:start position:0%
tweak to cause less confusion or are you
 
02:11:32.930 --> 02:11:32.940 align:start position:0%
happy with it or did you do that uh or
 
02:11:34.910 --> 02:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
you think this is the best solution the
 
02:11:36.430 --> 02:11:36.440 align:start position:0%
problem of what to do if you want to
 
02:11:39.050 --> 02:11:39.060 align:start position:0%
transfer the property on death to a
 
02:11:41.390 --> 02:11:41.400 align:start position:0%
government agency
 
02:11:44.570 --> 02:11:44.580 align:start position:0%
I think this this bill has a definition
 
02:11:46.910 --> 02:11:46.920 align:start position:0%
of person uh and as you mentioned that
 
02:11:49.729 --> 02:11:49.739 align:start position:0%
is broadly defined and person doesn't
 
02:11:51.830 --> 02:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
just mean an individual it could be in a
 
02:11:53.270 --> 02:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
state it could be a trust it could be a
 
02:11:55.550 --> 02:11:55.560 align:start position:0%
Business Partnership so we wanted to
 
02:11:59.510 --> 02:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
give individuals and entities of which
 
02:12:02.930 --> 02:12:02.940 align:start position:0%
those individuals are a member the
 
02:12:05.149 --> 02:12:05.159 align:start position:0%
broadest possible opportunity to convey
 
02:12:07.609 --> 02:12:07.619 align:start position:0%
so this definition of person is
 
02:12:09.410 --> 02:12:09.420 align:start position:0%
consistent with the definition of person
 
02:12:13.669 --> 02:12:13.679 align:start position:0%
that is found in the acts of all 29
 
02:12:15.890 --> 02:12:15.900 align:start position:0%
other states that have passed transfer
 
02:12:18.410 --> 02:12:18.420 align:start position:0%
on death legislation so I'm not
 
02:12:20.270 --> 02:12:20.280 align:start position:0%
anticipating any problems I've not heard
 
02:12:22.550 --> 02:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
of any problems with the definition of
 
02:12:22.560 --> 02:12:23.689 align:start position:0%
of any problems with the definition of
person

02:12:23.689 --> 02:12:23.699 align:start position:0%
person
 
02:12:25.850 --> 02:12:25.860 align:start position:0%

02:13:12.589 --> 02:13:12.599 align:start position:0%
discussion on the amendment

all right seeing none um I I
 
02:13:18.830 --> 02:13:18.840 align:start position:0%

anybody objects on the amendment and
 
02:13:21.709 --> 02:13:21.719 align:start position:0%
then we would have to have a roll call
 
02:13:23.990 --> 02:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
pardon a show of hands a show of hands
 
02:13:25.729 --> 02:13:25.739 align:start position:0%
on the amendment unless anybody objects

17 years three Nays motion passes
 
02:15:30.530 --> 02:15:30.540 align:start position:0%
um in light of the vote I think it
 
02:15:34.069 --> 02:15:34.079 align:start position:0%

02:15:36.589 --> 02:15:36.599 align:start position:0%
um representative kutab would you write
 
02:15:39.410 --> 02:15:39.420 align:start position:0%

02:15:43.189 --> 02:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:46.790 --> 02:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
oh I'll write one all right so
 
02:15:46.800 --> 02:15:48.790 align:start position:0%
oh I'll write one all right so
um

02:15:48.790 --> 02:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:51.470 --> 02:15:51.480 align:start position:0%
yeah and so um
 
02:15:54.470 --> 02:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
I'd like to have the reports uh all the
 
02:15:55.910 --> 02:15:55.920 align:start position:0%

02:16:14.510 --> 02:16:14.520 align:start position:0%
make one quick comment I want to make
 
02:16:17.450 --> 02:16:17.460 align:start position:0%
sure that everyone knows when I enter my
 
02:16:20.350 --> 02:16:20.360 align:start position:0%
next profession it is not going to be
 
02:16:29.330 --> 02:16:29.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:29.340 --> 02:16:33.950 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:16:33.950 --> 02:16:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:35.150 --> 02:16:35.160 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:16:35.160 --> 02:16:37.750 align:start position:0%
all right
um

02:16:37.750 --> 02:16:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:40.910 --> 02:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
all right good all right so then that
 
02:16:43.150 --> 02:16:43.160 align:start position:0%
takes care of
 
02:16:49.990 --> 02:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
533 I'm now going to turn to uh
 
02:16:53.950 --> 02:16:53.960 align:start position:0%
cacr2 and I'm going to recognize myself
 
02:16:58.190 --> 02:16:58.200 align:start position:0%
to make a motion uh of inexpedient to
 
02:17:01.070 --> 02:17:01.080 align:start position:0%
legislate and look to representative
 
02:17:03.469 --> 02:17:03.479 align:start position:0%
Wallace second all right so that motion
 
02:17:05.690 --> 02:17:05.700 align:start position:0%
has been made and seconded
 
02:17:05.700 --> 02:17:06.349 align:start position:0%
has been made and seconded
um

02:17:06.349 --> 02:17:06.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:11.030 --> 02:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
and I guess I would I would initially uh
 
02:17:12.709 --> 02:17:12.719 align:start position:0%
say this with regard to that and then
 
02:17:16.070 --> 02:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
obviously we'll open it to a discussion
 
02:17:16.080 --> 02:17:17.209 align:start position:0%
obviously we'll open it to a discussion
um

02:17:17.209 --> 02:17:17.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:20.450 --> 02:17:20.460 align:start position:0%
it seems to me
 
02:17:23.209 --> 02:17:23.219 align:start position:0%
and as as many of you
 
02:17:25.910 --> 02:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
probably know if uh I'm sure I'm sure
 
02:17:28.669 --> 02:17:28.679 align:start position:0%
remember the committee now if you ask me
 
02:17:31.009 --> 02:17:31.019 align:start position:0%
to sort of characterize myself as being
 
02:17:33.349 --> 02:17:33.359 align:start position:0%
pro-life for pro-choice I would
 
02:17:36.049 --> 02:17:36.059 align:start position:0%
characterize myself as pro-choice
 
02:17:38.030 --> 02:17:38.040 align:start position:0%
um although I do believe
 
02:17:40.610 --> 02:17:40.620 align:start position:0%
that um which is why I supported the
 
02:17:42.530 --> 02:17:42.540 align:start position:0%
fetal Life protection act that there
 
02:17:44.810 --> 02:17:44.820 align:start position:0%
comes a point
 
02:17:47.089 --> 02:17:47.099 align:start position:0%
um at which they're at which the
 
02:17:49.910 --> 02:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
pregnancy has preceded so far that that
 
02:17:52.849 --> 02:17:52.859 align:start position:0%
the state does have a strong interest in
 
02:17:56.270 --> 02:17:56.280 align:start position:0%
saying that in an ability to to uh
 
02:17:58.429 --> 02:17:58.439 align:start position:0%
regulate and to say no you can't have an
 
02:18:00.410 --> 02:18:00.420 align:start position:0%
abortion after this point
 
02:18:02.089 --> 02:18:02.099 align:start position:0%
and I know that there are people have
 
02:18:04.910 --> 02:18:04.920 align:start position:0%
different views on this issue
 
02:18:08.270 --> 02:18:08.280 align:start position:0%
I hope that the people who
 
02:18:12.830 --> 02:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:15.290 --> 02:18:15.300 align:start position:0%
will consider this
 
02:18:18.469 --> 02:18:18.479 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that what you are doing
 
02:18:21.410 --> 02:18:21.420 align:start position:0%
by this amendment is you're not if to
 
02:18:23.950 --> 02:18:23.960 align:start position:0%
the extent that you want to give
 
02:18:27.410 --> 02:18:27.420 align:start position:0%
greater protection to the right to an
 
02:18:27.420 --> 02:18:28.969 align:start position:0%
greater protection to the right to an
abortion

02:18:28.969 --> 02:18:28.979 align:start position:0%
abortion
 
02:18:31.969 --> 02:18:31.979 align:start position:0%
you're not doing it in this bill
 
02:18:34.490 --> 02:18:34.500 align:start position:0%
for example if there were if if there
 
02:18:36.589 --> 02:18:36.599 align:start position:0%
was a proposed Constitutional Amendment
 
02:18:39.230 --> 02:18:39.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:42.709 --> 02:18:42.719 align:start position:0%
no abortions no abortions I'm sorry
 
02:18:45.169 --> 02:18:45.179 align:start position:0%
there's a right to an abortion up to 24
 
02:18:48.049 --> 02:18:48.059 align:start position:0%
weeks up to up until 24 weeks of
 
02:18:49.549 --> 02:18:49.559 align:start position:0%
pregnancy with certain exceptions in
 
02:18:51.589 --> 02:18:51.599 align:start position:0%
other words if you were to take the
 
02:18:54.410 --> 02:18:54.420 align:start position:0%
fetal Life protection act and propose it
 
02:18:56.690 --> 02:18:56.700 align:start position:0%
as a constitutional amendment
 
02:18:58.490 --> 02:18:58.500 align:start position:0%
I don't know how I feel if I might be
 
02:19:00.290 --> 02:19:00.300 align:start position:0%
willing to support that I'm not sure I
 
02:19:02.089 --> 02:19:02.099 align:start position:0%
still might have some concern about
 
02:19:04.610 --> 02:19:04.620 align:start position:0%
should it should we really put this in
 
02:19:07.370 --> 02:19:07.380 align:start position:0%
the Constitution but maybe maybe I could
 
02:19:09.049 --> 02:19:09.059 align:start position:0%
be persuaded in that
 
02:19:13.009 --> 02:19:13.019 align:start position:0%
but what you've done by this proposed
 
02:19:15.830 --> 02:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
amendment is you've essentially said
 
02:19:18.889 --> 02:19:18.899 align:start position:0%
we're going to throw this to the court
 
02:19:21.110 --> 02:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
we're going to allow Mr chair I'd like
 
02:19:22.910 --> 02:19:22.920 align:start position:0%
to I'd hate to interrupt you but I'd
 
02:19:25.849 --> 02:19:25.859 align:start position:0%
like to object if you want to tell us
 
02:19:30.770 --> 02:19:30.780 align:start position:0%
why you want to vote itl I think that's
 
02:19:33.110 --> 02:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
perfectly appropriate but I don't really
 
02:19:36.889 --> 02:19:36.899 align:start position:0%
think you should be telling us what the
 
02:19:39.290 --> 02:19:39.300 align:start position:0%
other side wants
 
02:19:41.570 --> 02:19:41.580 align:start position:0%
um or what the other side expects in
 
02:19:44.330 --> 02:19:44.340 align:start position:0%
this there may be many reasons one of
 
02:19:45.889 --> 02:19:45.899 align:start position:0%
which I've heard from a number of your
 
02:19:48.589 --> 02:19:48.599 align:start position:0%
colleagues for example that this is an
 
02:19:51.590 --> 02:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
issue where we should let the people of
 
02:19:55.210 --> 02:19:55.220 align:start position:0%
the state decide so I would love to hear
 
02:19:58.610 --> 02:19:58.620 align:start position:0%
why you are voting the way you are but I
 
02:20:00.110 --> 02:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
don't really think it's helpful for you
 
02:20:02.330 --> 02:20:02.340 align:start position:0%
to decide why other people are voting
 
02:20:04.130 --> 02:20:04.140 align:start position:0%
the way they are thank you I'm not sure
 
02:20:05.690 --> 02:20:05.700 align:start position:0%
that I but thank you and I'm pretty sure
 
02:20:07.929 --> 02:20:07.939 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that I was was
 
02:20:11.870 --> 02:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
saying what other people are doing but I
 
02:20:14.630 --> 02:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
guess what I what I would say is this
 
02:20:17.870 --> 02:20:17.880 align:start position:0%
if the purpose of this
 
02:20:22.849 --> 02:20:22.859 align:start position:0%
is to Grant a greater right to abortion
 
02:20:25.670 --> 02:20:25.680 align:start position:0%
than exists now
 
02:20:29.270 --> 02:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
I I think that that
 
02:20:32.150 --> 02:20:32.160 align:start position:0%
is not accomplished by this amendment
 
02:20:34.490 --> 02:20:34.500 align:start position:0%
because what as I said before what it
 
02:20:34.500 --> 02:20:35.510 align:start position:0%
because what as I said before what it
does

02:20:35.510 --> 02:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
does
 
02:20:35.520 --> 02:20:36.830 align:start position:0%
does
is

02:20:36.830 --> 02:20:36.840 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:20:40.550 --> 02:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
um it says uh and I'm quoting now that
 
02:20:41.870 --> 02:20:41.880 align:start position:0%
an individual's right to personal
 
02:20:44.750 --> 02:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
reproductive autonomy is Central to uh
 
02:20:47.389 --> 02:20:47.399 align:start position:0%
is Central to the liberty and dignity to
 
02:20:50.270 --> 02:20:50.280 align:start position:0%
determine one's own life course and
 
02:20:52.610 --> 02:20:52.620 align:start position:0%
shall not be denied or infringed unless
 
02:20:54.490 --> 02:20:54.500 align:start position:0%
justified by a compelling State interest
 
02:20:57.469 --> 02:20:57.479 align:start position:0%
achieved by the least restrictive means
 
02:20:57.479 --> 02:20:58.670 align:start position:0%
achieved by the least restrictive means
so

02:20:58.670 --> 02:20:58.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:21:01.550 --> 02:21:01.560 align:start position:0%
what does that mean does that mean that
 
02:21:04.550 --> 02:21:04.560 align:start position:0%
they that if if this Constitutional
 
02:21:06.650 --> 02:21:06.660 align:start position:0%
Amendment were to pass
 
02:21:08.450 --> 02:21:08.460 align:start position:0%
that the current fetal Life protection
 
02:21:10.910 --> 02:21:10.920 align:start position:0%
act is unconstitutional
 
02:21:13.010 --> 02:21:13.020 align:start position:0%
you can't read this some some people may
 
02:21:14.510 --> 02:21:14.520 align:start position:0%
say well there's a compelling State
 
02:21:14.520 --> 02:21:15.370 align:start position:0%
say well there's a compelling State
interest

02:21:15.370 --> 02:21:15.380 align:start position:0%
interest
 
02:21:19.490 --> 02:21:19.500 align:start position:0%
achieved by the least restrictive means
 
02:21:22.130 --> 02:21:22.140 align:start position:0%
um uh by having an abort having a
 
02:21:24.650 --> 02:21:24.660 align:start position:0%
Prohibition on abortion of 24 weeks and
 
02:21:26.630 --> 02:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
some people might say no that's not true
 
02:21:29.330 --> 02:21:29.340 align:start position:0%
the the the the the the compelling State
 
02:21:33.410 --> 02:21:33.420 align:start position:0%
interest arises earlier or later
 
02:21:37.630 --> 02:21:37.640 align:start position:0%
what you've what you but by passing this
 
02:21:40.750 --> 02:21:40.760 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Amendment what
 
02:21:44.570 --> 02:21:44.580 align:start position:0%
effectively will be done is you will you
 
02:21:46.610 --> 02:21:46.620 align:start position:0%
will say Court
 
02:21:50.389 --> 02:21:50.399 align:start position:0%
you decide what you will what what the
 
02:21:52.849 --> 02:21:52.859 align:start position:0%
what the Constitution requires and we
 
02:21:54.110 --> 02:21:54.120 align:start position:0%
will have
 
02:21:57.349 --> 02:21:57.359 align:start position:0%
on the state level we will have a Roe v
 
02:22:01.250 --> 02:22:01.260 align:start position:0%
Wade uh uh I I will have our own Roe v
 
02:22:03.290 --> 02:22:03.300 align:start position:0%
Wade and all the controversy surrounding
 
02:22:06.050 --> 02:22:06.060 align:start position:0%
Roe v Wade on the state level and stop
 
02:22:08.090 --> 02:22:08.100 align:start position:0%
and think of some of the implications of
 
02:22:11.330 --> 02:22:11.340 align:start position:0%
that when somebody gets when Mr chairman
 
02:22:12.950 --> 02:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
you're speaking of the right of abortion
 
02:22:14.570 --> 02:22:14.580 align:start position:0%
but in New Hampshire are you supporting
 
02:22:17.150 --> 02:22:17.160 align:start position:0%
HB 88 that would codify that because
 
02:22:18.889 --> 02:22:18.899 align:start position:0%
there is is there a right to have an
 
02:22:20.330 --> 02:22:20.340 align:start position:0%
abortion in New Hampshire I'm going to
 
02:22:21.950 --> 02:22:21.960 align:start position:0%
make sure everybody has an opportunity
 
02:22:23.750 --> 02:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
no but I'm just you're speaking of the
 
02:22:25.010 --> 02:22:25.020 align:start position:0%
right to have an abortion in New
 
02:22:26.330 --> 02:22:26.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire what are you basing that on
 
02:22:29.510 --> 02:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
what I'm I'm speaking about the right to
 
02:22:31.190 --> 02:22:31.200 align:start position:0%
have an abortion in New Hampshire what
 
02:22:32.630 --> 02:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
am I basing it on because there's no
 
02:22:34.309 --> 02:22:34.319 align:start position:0%
prohibition on the right to have an
 
02:22:35.510 --> 02:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
abortion in New Hampshire right now
 
02:22:38.630 --> 02:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
except if it's after 24 if uh if it's
 
02:22:41.630 --> 02:22:41.640 align:start position:0%
after 24 weeks so what I was as I was
 
02:22:43.370 --> 02:22:43.380 align:start position:0%
saying you're gonna
 
02:22:45.830 --> 02:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
you're going to place this is you're
 
02:22:48.830 --> 02:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
going to place this issue basically
 
02:22:51.650 --> 02:22:51.660 align:start position:0%
this amendment throws this issue to the
 
02:22:53.510 --> 02:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court and says a supreme court
 
02:22:57.230 --> 02:22:57.240 align:start position:0%
you decide let five people decide what
 
02:22:59.270 --> 02:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
when does a compelling State interest
 
02:23:02.510 --> 02:23:02.520 align:start position:0%
arise is it at 24 weeks or 21 weeks or
 
02:23:02.520 --> 02:23:03.550 align:start position:0%
arise is it at 24 weeks or 21 weeks or
never

02:23:03.550 --> 02:23:03.560 align:start position:0%
never
 
02:23:05.570 --> 02:23:05.580 align:start position:0%
a person should have the right to
 
02:23:07.490 --> 02:23:07.500 align:start position:0%
abortion right to lead to the very end
 
02:23:11.210 --> 02:23:11.220 align:start position:0%
let the Court decide and consider some
 
02:23:15.170 --> 02:23:15.180 align:start position:0%
of the implications of having Roe versus
 
02:23:18.050 --> 02:23:18.060 align:start position:0%
Wade at the state level
 
02:23:20.330 --> 02:23:20.340 align:start position:0%
how about when you know it's been it's
 
02:23:23.030 --> 02:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
been with with one really unfortunate
 
02:23:23.040 --> 02:23:25.429 align:start position:0%
been with with one really unfortunate
exception

02:23:25.429 --> 02:23:25.439 align:start position:0%
exception
 
02:23:28.010 --> 02:23:28.020 align:start position:0%
the way judges have been selected in New
 
02:23:31.010 --> 02:23:31.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has been pretty bipartisan for
 
02:23:33.230 --> 02:23:33.240 align:start position:0%
quite a number of years Republican
 
02:23:35.090 --> 02:23:35.100 align:start position:0%
Governors have selected Democratic
 
02:23:37.250 --> 02:23:37.260 align:start position:0%
judges and Democratic Governors have
 
02:23:40.429 --> 02:23:40.439 align:start position:0%
selected Republican judges and in
 
02:23:40.439 --> 02:23:41.330 align:start position:0%
selected Republican judges and in
general

02:23:41.330 --> 02:23:41.340 align:start position:0%
general
 
02:23:43.429 --> 02:23:43.439 align:start position:0%
with you know maybe one or two
 
02:23:46.969 --> 02:23:46.979 align:start position:0%
exceptions we've avoided the kind of
 
02:23:48.410 --> 02:23:48.420 align:start position:0%
thing that has happened at the national
 
02:23:48.420 --> 02:23:49.790 align:start position:0%
thing that has happened at the national
level

02:23:49.790 --> 02:23:49.800 align:start position:0%
level
 
02:23:53.750 --> 02:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
but when you say to the court you decide
 
02:23:56.450 --> 02:23:56.460 align:start position:0%
Court as a state constitutional matter
 
02:23:59.750 --> 02:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
you decide when the right of abortion
 
02:24:01.790 --> 02:24:01.800 align:start position:0%
exists and what the what the limitations
 
02:24:01.800 --> 02:24:03.349 align:start position:0%
exists and what the what the limitations
are

02:24:03.349 --> 02:24:03.359 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:24:05.210 --> 02:24:05.220 align:start position:0%
what will be the what will be the
 
02:24:07.690 --> 02:24:07.700 align:start position:0%
implications of that for the next time
 
02:24:10.490 --> 02:24:10.500 align:start position:0%
that someone's up for for a nomination
 
02:24:12.590 --> 02:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
to the Supreme Court
 
02:24:16.070 --> 02:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
um so that's that's a summary of why I
 
02:24:18.770 --> 02:24:18.780 align:start position:0%
intend to support itl on this bill and I
 
02:24:20.090 --> 02:24:20.100 align:start position:0%
open it up to further discussion
 
02:24:22.490 --> 02:24:22.500 align:start position:0%
representative Turk
 
02:24:23.809 --> 02:24:23.819 align:start position:0%
um yeah I
 
02:24:23.819 --> 02:24:27.010 align:start position:0%
um yeah I
um

02:24:27.010 --> 02:24:27.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:30.170 --> 02:24:30.180 align:start position:0%
oppose the itl motion um I have I have a
 
02:24:32.330 --> 02:24:32.340 align:start position:0%
lot to say uh that I'll probably Reserve
 
02:24:34.849 --> 02:24:34.859 align:start position:0%
in case the itl motion does not succeed
 
02:24:37.550 --> 02:24:37.560 align:start position:0%
and there's a future motion um made the
 
02:24:39.950 --> 02:24:39.960 align:start position:0%
one thing I will point out though is
 
02:24:41.570 --> 02:24:41.580 align:start position:0%
um and thank you for reading the text of
 
02:24:44.929 --> 02:24:44.939 align:start position:0%
that key phrase in in this bill
 
02:24:48.889 --> 02:24:48.899 align:start position:0%
um I agree it's not specifically an
 
02:24:52.190 --> 02:24:52.200 align:start position:0%
abortion Bill obviously it encompasses
 
02:24:54.770 --> 02:24:54.780 align:start position:0%
and probably its reason for being for us
 
02:24:57.590 --> 02:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
is is heavily related to that but it it
 
02:24:59.450 --> 02:24:59.460 align:start position:0%
talks about two things reproductive
 
02:24:59.460 --> 02:25:00.530 align:start position:0%
talks about two things reproductive
freedom

02:25:00.530 --> 02:25:00.540 align:start position:0%
freedom
 
02:25:03.950 --> 02:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
which goes far beyond terminations
 
02:25:06.650 --> 02:25:06.660 align:start position:0%
um and gets at all forms of uh
 
02:25:08.990 --> 02:25:09.000 align:start position:0%
reproductive decisions and choice and
 
02:25:10.849 --> 02:25:10.859 align:start position:0%
the other thing is it doesn't specify
 
02:25:13.429 --> 02:25:13.439 align:start position:0%
women or the medical profession as some
 
02:25:15.469 --> 02:25:15.479 align:start position:0%
of the restrictions have it basically
 
02:25:17.750 --> 02:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
talks about the right of all people to
 
02:25:21.230 --> 02:25:21.240 align:start position:0%
make that choice men and women and
 
02:25:22.969 --> 02:25:22.979 align:start position:0%
families so I just wanted to sort of
 
02:25:24.770 --> 02:25:24.780 align:start position:0%
make sure we had the right perspective
 
02:25:27.170 --> 02:25:27.180 align:start position:0%
on what we would be itling if we were to
 
02:25:29.510 --> 02:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
go for this motion all right other
 
02:25:32.570 --> 02:25:32.580 align:start position:0%
comments representative Horgan
 
02:25:35.389 --> 02:25:35.399 align:start position:0%
well thank you first of all you know
 
02:25:37.490 --> 02:25:37.500 align:start position:0%
what a ropey wage situation but Ruby
 
02:25:39.349 --> 02:25:39.359 align:start position:0%
Wade actually survived for a pretty long
 
02:25:40.910 --> 02:25:40.920 align:start position:0%
time and it took a pretty concerted
 
02:25:43.849 --> 02:25:43.859 align:start position:0%
effort to get rid of it so um
 
02:25:45.889 --> 02:25:45.899 align:start position:0%
that may have not been such a terrible
 
02:25:48.290 --> 02:25:48.300 align:start position:0%
terrible example and I'm not I think
 
02:25:50.389 --> 02:25:50.399 align:start position:0%
there probably are some issues related
 
02:25:52.010 --> 02:25:52.020 align:start position:0%
to reproductive Freedom that maybe the
 
02:25:54.170 --> 02:25:54.180 align:start position:0%
courts which have a lot to do with the
 
02:25:56.270 --> 02:25:56.280 align:start position:0%
details of like a Pacific
 
02:25:59.150 --> 02:25:59.160 align:start position:0%
uh person's situation so perhaps the
 
02:26:01.010 --> 02:26:01.020 align:start position:0%
courts may be a more appropriate venue
 
02:26:03.050 --> 02:26:03.060 align:start position:0%
than the legislature to solve all these
 
02:26:05.450 --> 02:26:05.460 align:start position:0%
all these issues but um
 
02:26:07.730 --> 02:26:07.740 align:start position:0%
my main thing is reproductive Freedom
 
02:26:09.469 --> 02:26:09.479 align:start position:0%
it's not just about abortion it's also
 
02:26:12.050 --> 02:26:12.060 align:start position:0%
about whether or not to uh
 
02:26:14.809 --> 02:26:14.819 align:start position:0%
whether or not to you know whether or
 
02:26:16.550 --> 02:26:16.560 align:start position:0%
not you can be become pregnant in the
 
02:26:17.990 --> 02:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
first place like whether or not you can
 
02:26:21.110 --> 02:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
like uh whether or not
 
02:26:22.790 --> 02:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
whether or not you have a full choice of
 
02:26:25.610 --> 02:26:25.620 align:start position:0%
means of birth control it also uh
 
02:26:27.710 --> 02:26:27.720 align:start position:0%
as we see with the ongoing debate over
 
02:26:30.590 --> 02:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
uh transgender rights uh concerns like
 
02:26:32.990 --> 02:26:33.000 align:start position:0%
whether you have certain uh surgeries
 
02:26:35.090 --> 02:26:35.100 align:start position:0%
gender affirming surgeries and also like
 
02:26:38.630 --> 02:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
certain procedures that uh CIS people
 
02:26:41.690 --> 02:26:41.700 align:start position:0%
have and also it even has to do with uh
 
02:26:43.969 --> 02:26:43.979 align:start position:0%
some of the decisions
 
02:26:43.979 --> 02:26:44.809 align:start position:0%
some of the decisions
um

02:26:44.809 --> 02:26:44.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:46.910 --> 02:26:46.920 align:start position:0%
you make like after the baby is born
 
02:26:48.950 --> 02:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
like whether you can force people to
 
02:26:50.630 --> 02:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
give it up for adoption and stuff so
 
02:26:53.450 --> 02:26:53.460 align:start position:0%
that's a very broad range of
 
02:26:55.670 --> 02:26:55.680 align:start position:0%
broad range of issues I think this
 
02:26:57.290 --> 02:26:57.300 align:start position:0%
amendment or something like provides a
 
02:26:59.389 --> 02:26:59.399 align:start position:0%
much broader range of uh
 
02:27:01.910 --> 02:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
you know water you've lost a much
 
02:27:03.710 --> 02:27:03.720 align:start position:0%
broader range of issues rather than just
 
02:27:05.330 --> 02:27:05.340 align:start position:0%
the abortion and of course actually the
 
02:27:07.070 --> 02:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
24 week thing that's kind of a magic
 
02:27:09.530 --> 02:27:09.540 align:start position:0%
number that we've kind of arrived at but
 
02:27:11.330 --> 02:27:11.340 align:start position:0%
it's actually like a pretty
 
02:27:13.910 --> 02:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
arbitrary number like some fetuses are
 
02:27:16.670 --> 02:27:16.680 align:start position:0%
viable at 24 weeks um some aren't and
 
02:27:18.410 --> 02:27:18.420 align:start position:0%
even the ones are viable like takes
 
02:27:19.730 --> 02:27:19.740 align:start position:0%
pretty uh
 
02:27:22.370 --> 02:27:22.380 align:start position:0%
it takes you know like a you know pretty
 
02:27:24.050 --> 02:27:24.060 align:start position:0%
major intervention to keep them alive
 
02:27:26.630 --> 02:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
long enough to get to uh the point where
 
02:27:28.250 --> 02:27:28.260 align:start position:0%
they should be which is more like I
 
02:27:31.250 --> 02:27:31.260 align:start position:0%
think 37 or 38 weeks normally so I think
 
02:27:31.260 --> 02:27:32.270 align:start position:0%
think 37 or 38 weeks normally so I think
um

02:27:32.270 --> 02:27:32.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:34.309 --> 02:27:34.319 align:start position:0%
so I think this uh
 
02:27:36.050 --> 02:27:36.060 align:start position:0%
I think this amendment is uh I think
 
02:27:37.910 --> 02:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
this amendment is worthwhile
 
02:27:41.270 --> 02:27:41.280 align:start position:0%
um and uh if we have issues with precise
 
02:27:43.370 --> 02:27:43.380 align:start position:0%
wording uh we could
 
02:27:46.070 --> 02:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
we could always of course uh retain it
 
02:27:48.889 --> 02:27:48.899 align:start position:0%
because the people can't vote on it
 
02:27:51.830 --> 02:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
until 2024 anyway since there's no
 
02:27:54.230 --> 02:27:54.240 align:start position:0%
general election in 2023 so it doesn't
 
02:27:54.240 --> 02:27:55.670 align:start position:0%
general election in 2023 so it doesn't
uh

02:27:55.670 --> 02:27:55.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:27:58.130 --> 02:27:58.140 align:start position:0%
if the feeling is if the feeling is
 
02:28:00.889 --> 02:28:00.899 align:start position:0%
amongst the proposed Ito that they would
 
02:28:02.389 --> 02:28:02.399 align:start position:0%
like to do something but they don't like
 
02:28:04.429 --> 02:28:04.439 align:start position:0%
that exact wording there is plenty of
 
02:28:06.950 --> 02:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
time to have a subcommittee to decide on
 
02:28:08.750 --> 02:28:08.760 align:start position:0%
a slightly different wording but I think
 
02:28:10.190 --> 02:28:10.200 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
02:28:12.290 --> 02:28:12.300 align:start position:0%
I think it's excellent as is and covers
 
02:28:13.730 --> 02:28:13.740 align:start position:0%
show the full range of reproductive
 
02:28:15.530 --> 02:28:15.540 align:start position:0%
choices which is not just the choice of
 
02:28:17.330 --> 02:28:17.340 align:start position:0%
whether or not to have a portion of 24
 
02:28:19.370 --> 02:28:19.380 align:start position:0%
weeks because you know far beyond that
 
02:28:20.990 --> 02:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
so I would
 
02:28:22.550 --> 02:28:22.560 align:start position:0%
so I would certainly I'm certainly not
 
02:28:24.770 --> 02:28:24.780 align:start position:0%
going to vote for the uh itl motion so
 
02:28:26.809 --> 02:28:26.819 align:start position:0%
thanks all right other Comics
 
02:28:28.969 --> 02:28:28.979 align:start position:0%
representative Manos
 
02:28:30.469 --> 02:28:30.479 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
02:28:32.210 --> 02:28:32.220 align:start position:0%
um I will start
 
02:28:35.870 --> 02:28:35.880 align:start position:0%
the itl on this your itl motion but I
 
02:28:38.150 --> 02:28:38.160 align:start position:0%
wanted to point out that um certainly
 
02:28:38.160 --> 02:28:39.770 align:start position:0%
wanted to point out that um certainly
reproductive

02:28:39.770 --> 02:28:39.780 align:start position:0%
reproductive
 
02:28:42.710 --> 02:28:42.720 align:start position:0%
um reproductive Freedom includes in
 
02:28:44.410 --> 02:28:44.420 align:start position:0%
addition to abortion and birth control
 
02:28:47.630 --> 02:28:47.640 align:start position:0%
sterilization and I think I think we
 
02:28:49.190 --> 02:28:49.200 align:start position:0%
need to keep that in mind that
 
02:28:51.590 --> 02:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
reproductive freedom is a very broad
 
02:28:54.710 --> 02:28:54.720 align:start position:0%
range of reproductive choices but the
 
02:28:56.270 --> 02:28:56.280 align:start position:0%
other point I want to make is in
 
02:28:59.150 --> 02:28:59.160 align:start position:0%
response to your argument Mr chair
 
02:29:01.370 --> 02:29:01.380 align:start position:0%
these are all arguments that will be
 
02:29:03.110 --> 02:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
presented to the people of New Hampshire
 
02:29:07.550 --> 02:29:07.560 align:start position:0%
to consider and decide and I feel very
 
02:29:10.010 --> 02:29:10.020 align:start position:0%
very strongly that democracy with a
 
02:29:13.429 --> 02:29:13.439 align:start position:0%
small the Democratic Values small the
 
02:29:16.969 --> 02:29:16.979 align:start position:0%
um are very very important and that we
 
02:29:18.469 --> 02:29:18.479 align:start position:0%
need to let the people of New Hampshire
 
02:29:22.370 --> 02:29:22.380 align:start position:0%
make a decision on this and that that is
 
02:29:24.889 --> 02:29:24.899 align:start position:0%
what we should move forward with so I
 
02:29:28.910 --> 02:29:28.920 align:start position:0%
will be opposing the Ito other uh yes
 
02:29:31.190 --> 02:29:31.200 align:start position:0%
representative Staples Stapleton yeah
 
02:29:33.950 --> 02:29:33.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um
 
02:29:36.830 --> 02:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
kind of concur with what you scoped out
 
02:29:36.840 --> 02:29:38.030 align:start position:0%
kind of concur with what you scoped out
before

02:29:38.030 --> 02:29:38.040 align:start position:0%
before
 
02:29:39.650 --> 02:29:39.660 align:start position:0%
to some extent
 
02:29:39.660 --> 02:29:40.309 align:start position:0%
to some extent
um

02:29:40.309 --> 02:29:40.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:42.410 --> 02:29:42.420 align:start position:0%
and I but I believe the bill is
 
02:29:42.420 --> 02:29:44.630 align:start position:0%
and I but I believe the bill is
problematic

02:29:44.630 --> 02:29:44.640 align:start position:0%
problematic
 
02:29:49.010 --> 02:29:49.020 align:start position:0%
um on the on line five uh right from the
 
02:29:53.150 --> 02:29:53.160 align:start position:0%
beginning the two words unless Justified
 
02:29:55.570 --> 02:29:55.580 align:start position:0%
followed by compelling State interest
 
02:29:58.730 --> 02:29:58.740 align:start position:0%
opens this up to State standing
 
02:30:02.809 --> 02:30:02.819 align:start position:0%
for the state obligation to challenge
 
02:30:07.309 --> 02:30:07.319 align:start position:0%
um an abortion that they that might come
 
02:30:09.170 --> 02:30:09.180 align:start position:0%
into that scope of violating the
 
02:30:10.910 --> 02:30:10.920 align:start position:0%
compelling State interest
 
02:30:13.190 --> 02:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
and if you open up standing on that
 
02:30:16.190 --> 02:30:16.200 align:start position:0%
basis how about other interested parties
 
02:30:19.730 --> 02:30:19.740 align:start position:0%
to have standing like the father
 
02:30:22.250 --> 02:30:22.260 align:start position:0%
the other problem I have with this is
 
02:30:24.530 --> 02:30:24.540 align:start position:0%
missing unless otherwise prohibited by
 
02:30:24.540 --> 02:30:25.910 align:start position:0%
missing unless otherwise prohibited by
law

02:30:25.910 --> 02:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
law
 
02:30:28.130 --> 02:30:28.140 align:start position:0%
so we would have a conflict in law
 
02:30:31.849 --> 02:30:31.859 align:start position:0%
between the partial birth abortion ban
 
02:30:34.130 --> 02:30:34.140 align:start position:0%
that we have already on the books and
 
02:30:38.030 --> 02:30:38.040 align:start position:0%
the six-month prohibition
 
02:30:40.490 --> 02:30:40.500 align:start position:0%
so I see technical problems with this
 
02:30:43.490 --> 02:30:43.500 align:start position:0%
which is why I'll support the itl
 
02:30:46.250 --> 02:30:46.260 align:start position:0%
other comments
 
02:30:49.010 --> 02:30:49.020 align:start position:0%
see up yes representative greeson
 
02:30:51.410 --> 02:30:51.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I will be supporting
 
02:30:54.230 --> 02:30:54.240 align:start position:0%
the itl motion I think that words have
 
02:30:55.790 --> 02:30:55.800 align:start position:0%
meanings or they're supposed to have
 
02:30:58.010 --> 02:30:58.020 align:start position:0%
meanings but if we continue to change
 
02:30:59.870 --> 02:30:59.880 align:start position:0%
the definitions of words then everything
 
02:31:02.389 --> 02:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
is meaningless and nothing and no one
 
02:31:04.969 --> 02:31:04.979 align:start position:0%
matters and laws become unenforceable
 
02:31:07.130 --> 02:31:07.140 align:start position:0%
and rights become undefendable so the
 
02:31:09.050 --> 02:31:09.060 align:start position:0%
very Foundation of civilization crumbles
 
02:31:12.290 --> 02:31:12.300 align:start position:0%
and cacr2 uses some very broad language
 
02:31:14.630 --> 02:31:14.640 align:start position:0%
that opens up the possibility for the
 
02:31:17.150 --> 02:31:17.160 align:start position:0%
normalization of some pretty weird stuff
 
02:31:18.950 --> 02:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
for example we can't use the term
 
02:31:21.290 --> 02:31:21.300 align:start position:0%
pedophile anymore because that might be
 
02:31:23.510 --> 02:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
stigmatizing they're now called minor
 
02:31:25.790 --> 02:31:25.800 align:start position:0%
attracted persons as that sort of
 
02:31:27.590 --> 02:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
behavior is becoming more normalized and
 
02:31:30.650 --> 02:31:30.660 align:start position:0%
more popular so cacr2 would enable these
 
02:31:32.809 --> 02:31:32.819 align:start position:0%
persons to make their own reproductive
 
02:31:34.370 --> 02:31:34.380 align:start position:0%
decisions to pursue their childhood
 
02:31:36.770 --> 02:31:36.780 align:start position:0%
dreams and since we must not marginalize
 
02:31:38.389 --> 02:31:38.399 align:start position:0%
or stigmatize people brothers and
 
02:31:39.710 --> 02:31:39.720 align:start position:0%
sisters would be allowed to keep it in
 
02:31:41.210 --> 02:31:41.220 align:start position:0%
the family and it wouldn't be the first
 
02:31:43.130 --> 02:31:43.140 align:start position:0%
time in history that it was done but now
 
02:31:44.389 --> 02:31:44.399 align:start position:0%
we would be saying that that could be
 
02:31:46.910 --> 02:31:46.920 align:start position:0%
done again here and lastly some people
 
02:31:48.950 --> 02:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
love animals more than people so those
 
02:31:50.570 --> 02:31:50.580 align:start position:0%
with that Affinity would be able to
 
02:31:52.610 --> 02:31:52.620 align:start position:0%
engage in that behavior unless you think
 
02:31:55.070 --> 02:31:55.080 align:start position:0%
I'm extreme Spain just changed their
 
02:31:56.870 --> 02:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
Animal Welfare Law to make bestiality
 
02:31:58.730 --> 02:31:58.740 align:start position:0%
legal as long as no injury requiring
 
02:32:00.710 --> 02:32:00.720 align:start position:0%
Veterinary Care results from the act
 
02:32:02.270 --> 02:32:02.280 align:start position:0%
because as the sponsor of the new law
 
02:32:04.429 --> 02:32:04.439 align:start position:0%
said zoophiles are just another Spectrum
 
02:32:06.349 --> 02:32:06.359 align:start position:0%
on the trans flag
 
02:32:08.330 --> 02:32:08.340 align:start position:0%
on a more sane note
 
02:32:10.190 --> 02:32:10.200 align:start position:0%
what reproductive decisions do the
 
02:32:11.690 --> 02:32:11.700 align:start position:0%
biological fathers of pre-born babies
 
02:32:14.030 --> 02:32:14.040 align:start position:0%
have the right to make according to the
 
02:32:16.070 --> 02:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
testimony that was heard the only
 
02:32:17.690 --> 02:32:17.700 align:start position:0%
decision the man has is the right to
 
02:32:19.910 --> 02:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
keep his mouth shut he chose to have sex
 
02:32:22.130 --> 02:32:22.140 align:start position:0%
but that's as far as it goes he didn't
 
02:32:23.570 --> 02:32:23.580 align:start position:0%
choose to get her pregnant but now that
 
02:32:25.250 --> 02:32:25.260 align:start position:0%
she is his rights are over because no
 
02:32:28.250 --> 02:32:28.260 align:start position:0%
uterus no opinion now the Supreme Court
 
02:32:29.510 --> 02:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
has stated the United States Supreme
 
02:32:30.950 --> 02:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
Court has stated that her rights are
 
02:32:33.050 --> 02:32:33.060 align:start position:0%
given the greater weight not that he has
 
02:32:35.450 --> 02:32:35.460 align:start position:0%
no rights at all so perhaps the law
 
02:32:38.210 --> 02:32:38.220 align:start position:0%
should say what the law should do is say
 
02:32:40.070 --> 02:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
that she gets the right of first refusal
 
02:32:41.929 --> 02:32:41.939 align:start position:0%
if she doesn't want to keep the baby she
 
02:32:44.090 --> 02:32:44.100 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to but before any further
 
02:32:45.410 --> 02:32:45.420 align:start position:0%
action is taken he should have the right
 
02:32:47.030 --> 02:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
to step in and take responsibility for
 
02:32:49.370 --> 02:32:49.380 align:start position:0%
his actions and keep the baby himself if
 
02:32:51.170 --> 02:32:51.180 align:start position:0%
she choose if he should choose to do so
 
02:32:53.450 --> 02:32:53.460 align:start position:0%
perhaps the law needs to lay out this
 
02:32:55.250 --> 02:32:55.260 align:start position:0%
right and a mechanism for how this can
 
02:32:58.490 --> 02:32:58.500 align:start position:0%
be done cacr2 is is horribly flawed and
 
02:33:00.770 --> 02:33:00.780 align:start position:0%
should be inexpedient to legislate other
 
02:33:00.780 --> 02:33:02.330 align:start position:0%
should be inexpedient to legislate other

is there another motion yeah
 
02:34:08.030 --> 02:34:08.040 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry representative
 
02:34:10.490 --> 02:34:10.500 align:start position:0%
all right representative sir
 
02:34:12.469 --> 02:34:12.479 align:start position:0%
uh yeah I I would like to make the
 
02:34:17.570 --> 02:34:17.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:19.250 --> 02:34:19.260 align:start position:0%
ion's been made and second would you
 
02:34:20.030 --> 02:34:20.040 align:start position:0%
like to speak to your motion
 
02:34:22.309 --> 02:34:22.319 align:start position:0%
representative yes thank you
 
02:34:25.250 --> 02:34:25.260 align:start position:0%
um so uh I'll rehash a little bit of
 
02:34:27.290 --> 02:34:27.300 align:start position:0%
what I said a moment ago
 
02:34:29.990 --> 02:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
um this is a bill that's much broader
 
02:34:33.050 --> 02:34:33.060 align:start position:0%
than uh the question of uh termination
 
02:34:34.730 --> 02:34:34.740 align:start position:0%
of pregnancy
 
02:34:37.130 --> 02:34:37.140 align:start position:0%
um it gets at the entire spectrum of
 
02:34:39.170 --> 02:34:39.180 align:start position:0%
reproductive Freedom
 
02:34:39.180 --> 02:34:39.889 align:start position:0%
reproductive Freedom
um

02:34:39.889 --> 02:34:39.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:34:43.130 --> 02:34:43.140 align:start position:0%
which impacts
 
02:34:45.650 --> 02:34:45.660 align:start position:0%
various aspects that that relate to men
 
02:34:48.770 --> 02:34:48.780 align:start position:0%
as well as as to women we talked about
 
02:34:50.510 --> 02:34:50.520 align:start position:0%
their their
 
02:34:52.849 --> 02:34:52.859 align:start position:0%
um vasectomy would be would be covered
 
02:34:56.510 --> 02:34:56.520 align:start position:0%
by this uh all forms of contraception
 
02:34:58.610 --> 02:34:58.620 align:start position:0%
um things like that uh would be covered
 
02:35:00.290 --> 02:35:00.300 align:start position:0%
by this and the other thing is it it
 
02:35:02.210 --> 02:35:02.220 align:start position:0%
doesn't specify that it's just about
 
02:35:04.370 --> 02:35:04.380 align:start position:0%
women and and about their medical care
 
02:35:06.830 --> 02:35:06.840 align:start position:0%
it's about all individuals
 
02:35:10.370 --> 02:35:10.380 align:start position:0%
um being able to make those decisions
 
02:35:13.309 --> 02:35:13.319 align:start position:0%
for themselves and uh the part that I
 
02:35:15.170 --> 02:35:15.180 align:start position:0%
think you called out as the flaw I think
 
02:35:17.270 --> 02:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
is is is the important part of it which
 
02:35:19.309 --> 02:35:19.319 align:start position:0%
is it does leave a provision for
 
02:35:21.889 --> 02:35:21.899 align:start position:0%
compelling State interest it does say
 
02:35:21.899 --> 02:35:23.090 align:start position:0%
compelling State interest it does say
that

02:35:23.090 --> 02:35:23.100 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:35:24.770 --> 02:35:24.780 align:start position:0%
some of the things that representative
 
02:35:26.389 --> 02:35:26.399 align:start position:0%
Grayson mentioned
 
02:35:28.010 --> 02:35:28.020 align:start position:0%
um there would be a compelling State
 
02:35:29.929 --> 02:35:29.939 align:start position:0%
interest and and that would that would
 
02:35:32.570 --> 02:35:32.580 align:start position:0%
still be allowable under under this
 
02:35:34.610 --> 02:35:34.620 align:start position:0%
amendment so
 
02:35:36.710 --> 02:35:36.720 align:start position:0%
um let me go on a little bit uh in terms
 
02:35:38.750 --> 02:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
of why this is needed um so I want to
 
02:35:40.490 --> 02:35:40.500 align:start position:0%
point out not to not to make it sound
 
02:35:42.710 --> 02:35:42.720 align:start position:0%
too momentous but it is this is the
 
02:35:44.990 --> 02:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
first vote like this ever in the New
 
02:35:48.110 --> 02:35:48.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire house this is the first vote
 
02:35:51.070 --> 02:35:51.080 align:start position:0%
um that comes after a federal
 
02:35:53.690 --> 02:35:53.700 align:start position:0%
constitutional right was reversed and
 
02:35:56.090 --> 02:35:56.100 align:start position:0%
delegated back to state legislators to
 
02:35:58.010 --> 02:35:58.020 align:start position:0%
decide how to handle it
 
02:35:58.020 --> 02:35:59.990 align:start position:0%
decide how to handle it
um

02:35:59.990 --> 02:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:36:02.450 --> 02:36:02.460 align:start position:0%
Dobbs versus Jackson Women Health Center
 
02:36:05.330 --> 02:36:05.340 align:start position:0%
was was a bill about abortion but the
 
02:36:08.809 --> 02:36:08.819 align:start position:0%
concurrence of that uh justice Thomas
 
02:36:10.790 --> 02:36:10.800 align:start position:0%
specifically called into question other
 
02:36:13.010 --> 02:36:13.020 align:start position:0%
aspects that are covered by
 
02:36:14.750 --> 02:36:14.760 align:start position:0%
um the right to privacy including
 
02:36:16.730 --> 02:36:16.740 align:start position:0%
contraception so I do think it's
 
02:36:19.070 --> 02:36:19.080 align:start position:0%
important that we keep the the framework
 
02:36:21.830 --> 02:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
of what we're suggesting here
 
02:36:25.610 --> 02:36:25.620 align:start position:0%
um in focus and this is not to deny that
 
02:36:27.950 --> 02:36:27.960 align:start position:0%
this bill is probably here because of
 
02:36:30.230 --> 02:36:30.240 align:start position:0%
the question of of abortion
 
02:36:31.910 --> 02:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
um but but I think that's too narrow
 
02:36:34.490 --> 02:36:34.500 align:start position:0%
Focus so why ought to pass
 
02:36:34.500 --> 02:36:36.050 align:start position:0%
Focus so why ought to pass
um

02:36:36.050 --> 02:36:36.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:36:39.110 --> 02:36:39.120 align:start position:0%
again that that decision at the Supreme
 
02:36:40.730 --> 02:36:40.740 align:start position:0%
Court level
 
02:36:42.889 --> 02:36:42.899 align:start position:0%
um did not specifically make abortion
 
02:36:45.110 --> 02:36:45.120 align:start position:0%
legal or not illegal it just returned
 
02:36:47.809 --> 02:36:47.819 align:start position:0%
the power to the states
 
02:36:47.819 --> 02:36:49.910 align:start position:0%
the power to the states
um

02:36:49.910 --> 02:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:52.010 --> 02:36:52.020 align:start position:0%
the first thing I feel like we should do
 
02:36:54.469 --> 02:36:54.479 align:start position:0%
with this new power that has been given
 
02:36:56.210 --> 02:36:56.220 align:start position:0%
to us
 
02:36:58.250 --> 02:36:58.260 align:start position:0%
um by the federal government is to offer
 
02:37:00.530 --> 02:37:00.540 align:start position:0%
it back to the people that have had this
 
02:37:03.170 --> 02:37:03.180 align:start position:0%
right for 50 years
 
02:37:07.849 --> 02:37:07.859 align:start position:0%
supporting this cacr2 amendment is about
 
02:37:09.950 --> 02:37:09.960 align:start position:0%
Freedom it is about Liberty at their
 
02:37:12.530 --> 02:37:12.540 align:start position:0%
deepest level these are private
 
02:37:14.809 --> 02:37:14.819 align:start position:0%
decisions they're about families they're
 
02:37:16.550 --> 02:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
about our bodies they're about our
 
02:37:16.560 --> 02:37:17.990 align:start position:0%
about our bodies they're about our
health

02:37:17.990 --> 02:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
health
 
02:37:21.410 --> 02:37:21.420 align:start position:0%
um we are not making the decision by
 
02:37:23.389 --> 02:37:23.399 align:start position:0%
supporting this amendment
 
02:37:26.030 --> 02:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
um we are asking the people if they want
 
02:37:28.790 --> 02:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
this right that they've enjoyed for 50
 
02:37:30.590 --> 02:37:30.600 align:start position:0%
years back
 
02:37:33.770 --> 02:37:33.780 align:start position:0%
or if we as legislators should be the
 
02:37:35.870 --> 02:37:35.880 align:start position:0%
ones to continue to make these decisions
 
02:37:39.110 --> 02:37:39.120 align:start position:0%
so if this is adopted I would say we
 
02:37:40.490 --> 02:37:40.500 align:start position:0%
would be moving more or less to the
 
02:37:41.990 --> 02:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
status quo that people have become
 
02:37:44.450 --> 02:37:44.460 align:start position:0%
accustomed to
 
02:37:46.849 --> 02:37:46.859 align:start position:0%
um it would it would be only in the
 
02:37:49.450 --> 02:37:49.460 align:start position:0%
state's uh interest to to restrict
 
02:37:51.710 --> 02:37:51.720 align:start position:0%
reproductive Freedom
 
02:37:53.450 --> 02:37:53.460 align:start position:0%
um if not we will continue hearing many
 
02:37:56.330 --> 02:37:56.340 align:start position:0%
bills every year pro and con on this
 
02:37:58.370 --> 02:37:58.380 align:start position:0%
issue uh if you look at what we're
 
02:38:00.469 --> 02:38:00.479 align:start position:0%
hearing this year the range of bills
 
02:38:02.389 --> 02:38:02.399 align:start position:0%
goes from what we're hearing now
 
02:38:05.929 --> 02:38:05.939 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment to uh uh the
 
02:38:07.429 --> 02:38:07.439 align:start position:0%
these the heartbeat bill which would
 
02:38:09.710 --> 02:38:09.720 align:start position:0%
essentially ban all abortions so this is
 
02:38:12.230 --> 02:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
hardly a settled um
 
02:38:14.389 --> 02:38:14.399 align:start position:0%
place for the legislature to be
 
02:38:14.399 --> 02:38:16.790 align:start position:0%
place for the legislature to be
intervening

02:38:16.790 --> 02:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
intervening
 
02:38:16.800 --> 02:38:17.510 align:start position:0%
intervening
um

02:38:17.510 --> 02:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:38:19.490 --> 02:38:19.500 align:start position:0%
that that will be a choice people will
 
02:38:21.349 --> 02:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
make when they go to the ballot and and
 
02:38:23.210 --> 02:38:23.220 align:start position:0%
either pass or not pass this
 
02:38:25.070 --> 02:38:25.080 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Amendment needing
 
02:38:28.010 --> 02:38:28.020 align:start position:0%
three-fifths support in order to do it
 
02:38:29.870 --> 02:38:29.880 align:start position:0%
so this will not be a decision made
 
02:38:31.429 --> 02:38:31.439 align:start position:0%
lightly by the people in New Hampshire
 
02:38:31.439 --> 02:38:32.570 align:start position:0%
lightly by the people in New Hampshire
if

02:38:32.570 --> 02:38:32.580 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:38:35.330 --> 02:38:35.340 align:start position:0%
um this is presented to them I want to
 
02:38:36.950 --> 02:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
also talk to a couple of things that I
 
02:38:39.170 --> 02:38:39.180 align:start position:0%
think we heard during the testimony
 
02:38:40.849 --> 02:38:40.859 align:start position:0%
um one of them is are we talking about
 
02:38:42.650 --> 02:38:42.660 align:start position:0%
an unrestricted right that was just
 
02:38:44.750 --> 02:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
discussed a minute ago I'll say not
 
02:38:44.760 --> 02:38:45.650 align:start position:0%
discussed a minute ago I'll say not
really

02:38:45.650 --> 02:38:45.660 align:start position:0%
really
 
02:38:45.660 --> 02:38:46.750 align:start position:0%
really
um

02:38:46.750 --> 02:38:46.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:38:50.210 --> 02:38:50.220 align:start position:0%
what the bills we've seen already around
 
02:38:52.150 --> 02:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
um termination of pregnancy
 
02:38:55.429 --> 02:38:55.439 align:start position:0%
uh focus on the medical profession and
 
02:38:57.530 --> 02:38:57.540 align:start position:0%
the medical profession I will
 
02:38:57.540 --> 02:38:58.250 align:start position:0%
the medical profession I will
um

02:38:58.250 --> 02:38:58.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:39:01.309 --> 02:39:01.319 align:start position:0%
put forward is a heavily and
 
02:39:03.590 --> 02:39:03.600 align:start position:0%
successfully self-regulated profession
 
02:39:05.570 --> 02:39:05.580 align:start position:0%
in our state and I think we should keep
 
02:39:10.010 --> 02:39:10.020 align:start position:0%
it that way a few things that Physicians
 
02:39:12.290 --> 02:39:12.300 align:start position:0%
and practitioners other practitioners
 
02:39:14.450 --> 02:39:14.460 align:start position:0%
work with under their Hippocratic Oath
 
02:39:16.969 --> 02:39:16.979 align:start position:0%
the licensure restrictions their
 
02:39:19.250 --> 02:39:19.260 align:start position:0%
standards of care extensive standards of
 
02:39:22.010 --> 02:39:22.020 align:start position:0%
care around how um
 
02:39:23.990 --> 02:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
pregnancy and reproduction need to be
 
02:39:25.490 --> 02:39:25.500 align:start position:0%
handled there are ethics review
 
02:39:27.950 --> 02:39:27.960 align:start position:0%
committees at every organization where a
 
02:39:30.830 --> 02:39:30.840 align:start position:0%
procedure could be performed that would
 
02:39:33.650 --> 02:39:33.660 align:start position:0%
that would come into play if anything uh
 
02:39:35.929 --> 02:39:35.939 align:start position:0%
that's that seemed unethical was was
 
02:39:38.389 --> 02:39:38.399 align:start position:0%
being requested then there are insurance
 
02:39:40.429 --> 02:39:40.439 align:start position:0%
company rules that dictate what can be
 
02:39:43.910 --> 02:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
done and their malpractice laws that can
 
02:39:46.490 --> 02:39:46.500 align:start position:0%
also dictate the profession so it is not
 
02:39:49.070 --> 02:39:49.080 align:start position:0%
an unrestricted right
 
02:39:51.290 --> 02:39:51.300 align:start position:0%
um and and the things that we've heard
 
02:39:53.510 --> 02:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
about in the testimony some terrible
 
02:39:55.370 --> 02:39:55.380 align:start position:0%
abuses that we heard about in the
 
02:39:55.380 --> 02:39:56.929 align:start position:0%
abuses that we heard about in the
testimony

02:39:56.929 --> 02:39:56.939 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
02:39:56.939 --> 02:39:58.070 align:start position:0%
testimony
um

02:39:58.070 --> 02:39:58.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:40:00.230 --> 02:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
those were not
 
02:40:00.240 --> 02:40:00.950 align:start position:0%
those were not
um

02:40:00.950 --> 02:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:40:03.349 --> 02:40:03.359 align:start position:0%
related to reproductive Freedom those
 
02:40:05.090 --> 02:40:05.100 align:start position:0%
were criminal acts that we were told
 
02:40:07.790 --> 02:40:07.800 align:start position:0%
about happening in other states and the
 
02:40:09.710 --> 02:40:09.720 align:start position:0%
people who committed them one person in
 
02:40:11.690 --> 02:40:11.700 align:start position:0%
particular that was highlighted you know
 
02:40:13.070 --> 02:40:13.080 align:start position:0%
is serving three consecutive life
 
02:40:15.770 --> 02:40:15.780 align:start position:0%
sentences for that and I asked whether
 
02:40:18.590 --> 02:40:18.600 align:start position:0%
or not that person could be prosecuted
 
02:40:20.330 --> 02:40:20.340 align:start position:0%
under current New Hampshire law and the
 
02:40:22.790 --> 02:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
answer was yes most likely so so I think
 
02:40:24.770 --> 02:40:24.780 align:start position:0%
we already have plenty of restrictions
 
02:40:27.349 --> 02:40:27.359 align:start position:0%
uh prohibitions against that so I'm just
 
02:40:29.150 --> 02:40:29.160 align:start position:0%
going to sum up and say
 
02:40:31.610 --> 02:40:31.620 align:start position:0%
we have to ask ourselves
 
02:40:33.889 --> 02:40:33.899 align:start position:0%
um the question before us really isn't
 
02:40:35.750 --> 02:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
about whether abortion should be legal
 
02:40:37.610 --> 02:40:37.620 align:start position:0%
or not I actually somewhat agree this
 
02:40:40.849 --> 02:40:40.859 align:start position:0%
does not settle the case completely that
 
02:40:42.650 --> 02:40:42.660 align:start position:0%
that it will or will not
 
02:40:45.410 --> 02:40:45.420 align:start position:0%
um but it says that there's a individual
 
02:40:47.690 --> 02:40:47.700 align:start position:0%
right to make your reproductive choices
 
02:40:50.450 --> 02:40:50.460 align:start position:0%
your most personal uh choices you make
 
02:40:52.670 --> 02:40:52.680 align:start position:0%
in your whole life so we're really
 
02:40:56.150 --> 02:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
asking by by whether we um pass this or
 
02:40:58.070 --> 02:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
not if we know better than the people
 
02:41:00.110 --> 02:41:00.120 align:start position:0%
across the state what's best for them
 
02:41:02.809 --> 02:41:02.819 align:start position:0%
and if they want us involved in this
 
02:41:05.690 --> 02:41:05.700 align:start position:0%
decision or not and I'm going to say
 
02:41:08.690 --> 02:41:08.700 align:start position:0%
that uh voting no simply says that we
 
02:41:10.070 --> 02:41:10.080 align:start position:0%
don't trust the people of New Hampshire
 
02:41:11.870 --> 02:41:11.880 align:start position:0%
to make the right decisions for
 
02:41:11.880 --> 02:41:13.429 align:start position:0%
to make the right decisions for
themselves

02:41:13.429 --> 02:41:13.439 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
02:41:15.349 --> 02:41:15.359 align:start position:0%
I hope we will vote
 
02:41:17.990 --> 02:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
ought to pass on this and put it before
 
02:41:21.950 --> 02:41:21.960 align:start position:0%
the people of New Hampshire to decide in
 
02:41:24.290 --> 02:41:24.300 align:start position:0%
this new environment that that very few
 
02:41:26.270 --> 02:41:26.280 align:start position:0%
of uh the people of our state have lived
 
02:41:26.280 --> 02:41:27.110 align:start position:0%
of uh the people of our state have lived
under

02:41:27.110 --> 02:41:27.120 align:start position:0%
under
 
02:41:30.170 --> 02:41:30.180 align:start position:0%
um for the in in their in their lives
 
02:41:33.170 --> 02:41:33.180 align:start position:0%
um whether they want that right back or
 
02:41:36.530 --> 02:41:36.540 align:start position:0%
not thank you all right other uh
 
02:41:38.690 --> 02:41:38.700 align:start position:0%
comments yes representative Oregon
 
02:41:40.730 --> 02:41:40.740 align:start position:0%
um yes I I agree with everything
 
02:41:43.070 --> 02:41:43.080 align:start position:0%
represent representative from Exeter
 
02:41:44.690 --> 02:41:44.700 align:start position:0%
just said as I said there's a lot more
 
02:41:46.130 --> 02:41:46.140 align:start position:0%
to reproductive freedom than just
 
02:41:50.510 --> 02:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
abortion and uh Ruby Wade was superseded
 
02:41:52.969 --> 02:41:52.979 align:start position:0%
by the Dobbs decision but that's
 
02:41:54.770 --> 02:41:54.780 align:start position:0%
probably a fairly narrow decision it
 
02:41:56.630 --> 02:41:56.640 align:start position:0%
took a very very concerted effort to
 
02:41:58.550 --> 02:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
overturn it so it's probably
 
02:41:59.750 --> 02:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
would have been better for the country
 
02:42:02.990 --> 02:42:03.000 align:start position:0%
to leave Roe v Wade in place but that's
 
02:42:05.450 --> 02:42:05.460 align:start position:0%
um not where that's not what you are so
 
02:42:07.730 --> 02:42:07.740 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't think the Specter of a
 
02:42:09.290 --> 02:42:09.300 align:start position:0%
Roe v Wade situation New Hampshire
 
02:42:11.750 --> 02:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
scares me as much as I think I trust our
 
02:42:14.570 --> 02:42:14.580 align:start position:0%
court system even though I probably
 
02:42:17.330 --> 02:42:17.340 align:start position:0%
um maybe more than some people do but as
 
02:42:19.429 --> 02:42:19.439 align:start position:0%
a practical matter where we are now to
 
02:42:22.309 --> 02:42:22.319 align:start position:0%
pass it we're going to need 240 votes on
 
02:42:25.250 --> 02:42:25.260 align:start position:0%
the floor so that's going to take
 
02:42:27.830 --> 02:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
it's obviously gonna take a lot of uh a
 
02:42:31.070 --> 02:42:31.080 align:start position:0%
lot of people a lot of people um a lot
 
02:42:32.389 --> 02:42:32.399 align:start position:0%
of people in a certain political party
 
02:42:34.070 --> 02:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
will have to change their minds
 
02:42:35.929 --> 02:42:35.939 align:start position:0%
significantly from where they are now so
 
02:42:37.370 --> 02:42:37.380 align:start position:0%
I think um
 
02:42:39.290 --> 02:42:39.300 align:start position:0%
I mean I'd love to see that happen but I
 
02:42:40.969 --> 02:42:40.979 align:start position:0%
think that's uh
 
02:42:42.590 --> 02:42:42.600 align:start position:0%
that's going to take that's going to
 
02:42:44.450 --> 02:42:44.460 align:start position:0%
take a fairly remarkable chain of events
 
02:42:47.570 --> 02:42:47.580 align:start position:0%
to make it happen so I think there's uh
 
02:42:49.250 --> 02:42:49.260 align:start position:0%
I think there's no point in sending it
 
02:42:51.230 --> 02:42:51.240 align:start position:0%
to this floor now if we're not in
 
02:42:53.210 --> 02:42:53.220 align:start position:0%
agreement but um I would certainly
 
02:42:54.889 --> 02:42:54.899 align:start position:0%
prefer to vote for
 
02:42:58.010 --> 02:42:58.020 align:start position:0%
for although I certainly uh support the
 
02:42:59.570 --> 02:42:59.580 align:start position:0%
ought to pass motion and if we're lucky
 
02:43:02.929 --> 02:43:02.939 align:start position:0%
uh for Lucky maybe we will get those 240
 
02:43:05.690 --> 02:43:05.700 align:start position:0%
votes so I'm sure I'm sure everyone will
 
02:43:07.670 --> 02:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
be lobbied very hard on all sides of the
 
02:43:10.250 --> 02:43:10.260 align:start position:0%
issue so I uh I look forward to voting
 
02:43:12.290 --> 02:43:12.300 align:start position:0%
for for ought to pass so and hopefully
 
02:43:14.330 --> 02:43:14.340 align:start position:0%
someday this amendment will pass I'd
 
02:43:17.270 --> 02:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
like to see it happen in 2024 but
 
02:43:19.969 --> 02:43:19.979 align:start position:0%
it might be some other year thanks other
 
02:43:22.969 --> 02:43:22.979 align:start position:0%
Comics yes representative
 
02:43:26.750 --> 02:43:26.760 align:start position:0%
yes um so necessarily you know when we
 
02:43:29.150 --> 02:43:29.160 align:start position:0%
think about reproductive productive
 
02:43:31.190 --> 02:43:31.200 align:start position:0%
Freedom we're not only thinking about
 
02:43:33.950 --> 02:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
well as I say like we said
 
02:43:36.349 --> 02:43:36.359 align:start position:0%
um terminations abortions we're also
 
02:43:37.730 --> 02:43:37.740 align:start position:0%
thinking about birth control and
 
02:43:40.429 --> 02:43:40.439 align:start position:0%
sterilizations and
 
02:43:42.770 --> 02:43:42.780 align:start position:0%
um we really need to think about I know
 
02:43:45.230 --> 02:43:45.240 align:start position:0%
when I knocked on my doors and became a
 
02:43:47.990 --> 02:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
state rep here I can tell you the amount
 
02:43:49.190 --> 02:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
of people
 
02:43:53.090 --> 02:43:53.100 align:start position:0%
not only females males as well who were
 
02:43:55.370 --> 02:43:55.380 align:start position:0%
very concerned that we've lost a lot
 
02:43:58.070 --> 02:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
within our country and not and within
 
02:44:00.889 --> 02:44:00.899 align:start position:0%
our state so I am here today to make
 
02:44:03.170 --> 02:44:03.180 align:start position:0%
sure that I'm standing up for ought to
 
02:44:06.590 --> 02:44:06.600 align:start position:0%
pass and it's very important
 
02:44:08.809 --> 02:44:08.819 align:start position:0%
um I'm a nurse as well so it's very very
 
02:44:11.210 --> 02:44:11.220 align:start position:0%
important that we make sure that we
 
02:44:14.150 --> 02:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
stand strong thank you other comments on
 
02:44:15.650 --> 02:44:15.660 align:start position:0%
this bill on this yeah yes
 
02:44:17.210 --> 02:44:17.220 align:start position:0%
representative Staples
 
02:44:19.309 --> 02:44:19.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
02:44:22.190 --> 02:44:22.200 align:start position:0%
if I were a proponent of this bill
 
02:44:25.070 --> 02:44:25.080 align:start position:0%
which I'm not but if I were
 
02:44:27.889 --> 02:44:27.899 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I would include
 
02:44:30.110 --> 02:44:30.120 align:start position:0%
was some of the stuff that the sponsor
 
02:44:33.130 --> 02:44:33.140 align:start position:0%
talked about in testimony to Define
 
02:44:35.270 --> 02:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
reproductive freedom
 
02:44:39.050 --> 02:44:39.060 align:start position:0%
including contraception abortion
 
02:44:39.060 --> 02:44:40.910 align:start position:0%
including contraception abortion
sterilization

02:44:40.910 --> 02:44:40.920 align:start position:0%
sterilization
 
02:44:43.010 --> 02:44:43.020 align:start position:0%
forced or voluntary
 
02:44:46.070 --> 02:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
number of children or no children
 
02:44:48.650 --> 02:44:48.660 align:start position:0%
there's no adequate definition it could
 
02:44:51.530 --> 02:44:51.540 align:start position:0%
be anybody's subjective interpretation
 
02:44:53.510 --> 02:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
and that's going to be a problem for
 
02:44:55.790 --> 02:44:55.800 align:start position:0%
action and defense
 
02:44:59.330 --> 02:44:59.340 align:start position:0%
the other thing is is that when we tend
 
02:45:02.330 --> 02:45:02.340 align:start position:0%
to to make a lot of assumptions that the
 
02:45:06.230 --> 02:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
only thing that Dobbs did was overturn
 
02:45:10.130 --> 02:45:10.140 align:start position:0%
row and throw it back to the States
 
02:45:12.230 --> 02:45:12.240 align:start position:0%
but the first thing it did was declare
 
02:45:14.330 --> 02:45:14.340 align:start position:0%
that there is no constitutional right to
 
02:45:16.910 --> 02:45:16.920 align:start position:0%
abortion and then it throws it back to
 
02:45:17.870 --> 02:45:17.880 align:start position:0%
the States
 
02:45:19.849 --> 02:45:19.859 align:start position:0%
and if there's no constitutional right
 
02:45:22.309 --> 02:45:22.319 align:start position:0%
to abortion on a federal level
 
02:45:25.010 --> 02:45:25.020 align:start position:0%
we are as States subscribe to the
 
02:45:27.650 --> 02:45:27.660 align:start position:0%
Federal Constitution linked
 
02:45:29.510 --> 02:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
to that decision
 
02:45:32.809 --> 02:45:32.819 align:start position:0%
and so we need to keep that in mind as
 
02:45:36.230 --> 02:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
much as the state authority to act
 
02:45:39.410 --> 02:45:39.420 align:start position:0%
independently on whatever it decides to
 
02:45:42.110 --> 02:45:42.120 align:start position:0%
do in these type of cases
 
02:45:45.290 --> 02:45:45.300 align:start position:0%
thank you other comments all right it
 
02:45:46.309 --> 02:45:46.319 align:start position:0%
looks like we're up I'm sorry
 
02:45:47.809 --> 02:45:47.819 align:start position:0%
representative Manos
 
02:45:49.730 --> 02:45:49.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I just wanted to
 
02:45:51.830 --> 02:45:51.840 align:start position:0%
respond to representative Stapleton and
 
02:45:53.450 --> 02:45:53.460 align:start position:0%
what he just said
 
02:45:56.690 --> 02:45:56.700 align:start position:0%
um certainly a state constitution can be
 
02:45:59.450 --> 02:45:59.460 align:start position:0%
more protective than than the Federal
 
02:46:01.730 --> 02:46:01.740 align:start position:0%
Constitution and so we're certainly
 
02:46:06.170 --> 02:46:06.180 align:start position:0%
within our rights to put forward a
 
02:46:08.690 --> 02:46:08.700 align:start position:0%
proposed state constitution to protect
 
02:46:10.730 --> 02:46:10.740 align:start position:0%
Reproductive Rights certainly that's
 
02:46:15.110 --> 02:46:15.120 align:start position:0%
permissible and then I absolutely trust
 
02:46:16.790 --> 02:46:16.800 align:start position:0%
the people of New Hampshire to think
 
02:46:18.830 --> 02:46:18.840 align:start position:0%
these issues through all the issues that
 
02:46:20.809 --> 02:46:20.819 align:start position:0%
have been raised and to make their
 
02:46:23.929 --> 02:46:23.939 align:start position:0%
decision and I just strongly support a
 
02:46:27.290 --> 02:46:27.300 align:start position:0%
democratic process for for the citizens
 
02:46:29.150 --> 02:46:29.160 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire the voters of New
 
02:46:31.790 --> 02:46:31.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to make their decision on the
 
02:46:34.849 --> 02:46:34.859 align:start position:0%
these critically important issues all
 
02:46:37.550 --> 02:46:37.560 align:start position:0%
right thank you other representative
 
02:46:39.530 --> 02:46:39.540 align:start position:0%
yeah I just wanted to add one more thing
 
02:46:42.050 --> 02:46:42.060 align:start position:0%
also also related to what representative
 
02:46:44.210 --> 02:46:44.220 align:start position:0%
Stapleton said uh regarding the lack of
 
02:46:46.370 --> 02:46:46.380 align:start position:0%
a definition of reproductive Freedom uh
 
02:46:49.070 --> 02:46:49.080 align:start position:0%
I just want to point out that we are at
 
02:46:51.070 --> 02:46:51.080 align:start position:0%
a time where we have unprecedented
 
02:46:54.410 --> 02:46:54.420 align:start position:0%
technology regarding reproduction and
 
02:46:57.170 --> 02:46:57.180 align:start position:0%
that technology covers the prevention of
 
02:46:59.389 --> 02:46:59.399 align:start position:0%
pregnancy it covers the termination of
 
02:47:01.490 --> 02:47:01.500 align:start position:0%
pregnancy but it also covers the other
 
02:47:04.490 --> 02:47:04.500 align:start position:0%
side of the spectrum the the creation of
 
02:47:07.550 --> 02:47:07.560 align:start position:0%
life we have the ability to create uh
 
02:47:10.550 --> 02:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
life outside of the womb uh and and and
 
02:47:13.610 --> 02:47:13.620 align:start position:0%
continue it there are there are various
 
02:47:15.530 --> 02:47:15.540 align:start position:0%
iterations of that you know that have
 
02:47:17.150 --> 02:47:17.160 align:start position:0%
happened over decades across the country
 
02:47:19.490 --> 02:47:19.500 align:start position:0%
that's part of reproductive Freedom as
 
02:47:21.770 --> 02:47:21.780 align:start position:0%
well and the technology continues to
 
02:47:23.469 --> 02:47:23.479 align:start position:0%
evolve I think
 
02:47:27.469 --> 02:47:27.479 align:start position:0%
uh the concept of reproduction is at the
 
02:47:29.510 --> 02:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
core of the definition of reproductive
 
02:47:31.250 --> 02:47:31.260 align:start position:0%
freedom and I think that's pretty
 
02:47:34.610 --> 02:47:34.620 align:start position:0%
clearly defined all right other comments
 
02:47:36.349 --> 02:47:36.359 align:start position:0%
all right I seeing none I guess we're
 
02:47:39.770 --> 02:47:39.780 align:start position:0%

02:48:42.950 --> 02:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
um I would like to suggest that we at
 
02:48:46.309 --> 02:48:46.319 align:start position:0%
this point agree to send this uh to the
 
02:48:49.450 --> 02:48:49.460 align:start position:0%
floor without recommendation and
 
02:48:51.950 --> 02:48:51.960 align:start position:0%
understanding your previous commitment
 
02:48:54.830 --> 02:48:54.840 align:start position:0%
that we use this as a natural time to
 
02:48:57.230 --> 02:48:57.240 align:start position:0%
take a little breath a little break
 
02:48:57.240 --> 02:48:58.969 align:start position:0%
take a little breath a little break
catch

02:48:58.969 --> 02:48:58.979 align:start position:0%

you're absolutely right you know just
 
02:49:09.590 --> 02:49:09.600 align:start position:0%
one thing I can I say um just before we
 
02:49:11.690 --> 02:49:11.700 align:start position:0%
uh we break
 
02:49:15.410 --> 02:49:15.420 align:start position:0%
um I'll write the report in favor of itl
 
02:49:17.990 --> 02:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering if uh who will write
 
02:49:20.510 --> 02:49:20.520 align:start position:0%
the report of OTP representative tour is
 
02:49:21.830 --> 02:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
going to write that sure okay great
 
02:49:23.150 --> 02:49:23.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:49:23.160 --> 02:49:25.570 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

02:49:25.570 --> 02:49:25.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:30.230 --> 02:49:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:35.530 --> 02:49:35.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:38.150 --> 02:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
and as I as I said before at Repertory
 
02:49:39.889 --> 02:49:39.899 align:start position:0%
you know if like if you get it to me by
 
02:49:41.270 --> 02:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
midnight that's fine I don't care if
 
02:49:42.410 --> 02:49:42.420 align:start position:0%
it's in the evening I know we have a
 
02:49:45.050 --> 02:49:45.060 align:start position:0%
session tomorrow so it's yeah uh all
 
02:49:46.790 --> 02:49:46.800 align:start position:0%
right all right so let's take we're
 
02:49:48.410 --> 02:49:48.420 align:start position:0%
gonna I'm gonna recess the executive
 
02:49:50.990 --> 02:49:51.000 align:start position:0%
session now and we will resume at let's
 
02:49:52.670 --> 02:49:52.680 align:start position:0%
say one o'clock
 
02:49:55.550 --> 02:49:55.560 align:start position:0%
um that that will give you enough time I
 
02:49:56.950 --> 02:49:56.960 align:start position:0%
think yeah um
 
02:49:59.389 --> 02:49:59.399 align:start position:0%
and and the next bill that we will take
 
02:50:02.090 --> 02:50:02.100 align:start position:0%
up will be House Bill 88. all right
 
02:50:07.130 --> 02:50:07.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:07.140 --> 02:50:08.389 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

02:50:08.389 --> 02:50:08.399 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:50:24.490 --> 02:50:24.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:44.090 --> 04:00:44.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:24.590 --> 04:10:24.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:24.600 --> 04:10:25.910 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:10:25.910 --> 04:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:10:28.790 --> 04:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
um what I'd like to do then is is turn
 
04:10:32.330 --> 04:10:32.340 align:start position:0%
to House Bill 88 I won't make a motion
 
04:10:35.330 --> 04:10:35.340 align:start position:0%

04:10:40.010 --> 04:10:40.020 align:start position:0%
like to just sort of have

believe that we need to have some type
of

04:12:05.990 --> 04:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:12:08.870 --> 04:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
um believe in the fetal Life protection
 
04:12:11.689 --> 04:12:11.699 align:start position:0%
act many of them did not know what it
 
04:12:13.610 --> 04:12:13.620 align:start position:0%
was and I was quick to educate them
 
04:12:15.650 --> 04:12:15.660 align:start position:0%
because there was so much misinformation
 
04:12:17.410 --> 04:12:17.420 align:start position:0%
out there
 
04:12:20.870 --> 04:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
but in finding out about it and knowing
 
04:12:24.710 --> 04:12:24.720 align:start position:0%
about it I believe that my constituents
 
04:12:28.790 --> 04:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
are very content with keeping the fetal
 
04:12:33.229 --> 04:12:33.239 align:start position:0%
like protection act as it is now not
 
04:12:37.550 --> 04:12:37.560 align:start position:0%
changing it now and moving forward so
 
04:12:42.170 --> 04:12:42.180 align:start position:0%
therefore I would like to propose that
 
04:12:45.469 --> 04:12:45.479 align:start position:0%
we itl this Bill thank you all right
 
04:12:48.590 --> 04:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to speak to uh house
 
04:12:52.550 --> 04:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:54.769 --> 04:12:54.779 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I wouldn't thank you
 
04:12:56.689 --> 04:12:56.699 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander I I appreciate
 
04:12:59.150 --> 04:12:59.160 align:start position:0%
it um house full 88 would create a um
 
04:13:01.670 --> 04:13:01.680 align:start position:0%
private right of action
 
04:13:05.030 --> 04:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
um and would award injunctive relief
 
04:13:06.469 --> 04:13:06.479 align:start position:0%
um typically I've been opposed to
 
04:13:08.809 --> 04:13:08.819 align:start position:0%
creating additional rights of actions um
 
04:13:10.130 --> 04:13:10.140 align:start position:0%
so that's the reason why I'll be voting
 
04:13:13.550 --> 04:13:13.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:16.250 --> 04:13:16.260 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to speak to uh House
 
04:13:18.110 --> 04:13:18.120 align:start position:0%
Bill 88 I guess the only thing that I
 
04:13:20.929 --> 04:13:20.939 align:start position:0%
would say on House Bill 88 is I am going
 
04:13:24.410 --> 04:13:24.420 align:start position:0%
to support the the itl
 
04:13:26.330 --> 04:13:26.340 align:start position:0%
um motion because
 
04:13:28.849 --> 04:13:28.859 align:start position:0%
it's not clear to me
 
04:13:32.990 --> 04:13:33.000 align:start position:0%
exactly what this bill accomplishes
 
04:13:35.090 --> 04:13:35.100 align:start position:0%
um if I understand it correctly it says
 
04:13:37.370 --> 04:13:37.380 align:start position:0%
that it's that except
 
04:13:39.889 --> 04:13:39.899 align:start position:0%
except as the fetal Life protection act
 
04:13:39.899 --> 04:13:42.469 align:start position:0%
except as the fetal Life protection act
prohibits

04:13:42.469 --> 04:13:42.479 align:start position:0%
prohibits
 
04:13:45.050 --> 04:13:45.060 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
04:13:46.910 --> 04:13:46.920 align:start position:0%
uh abortion
 
04:13:51.170 --> 04:13:51.180 align:start position:0%
um abortion is allowed and so I I that
 
04:13:53.030 --> 04:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
but that's already the law
 
04:13:55.130 --> 04:13:55.140 align:start position:0%
so what do we need this for and and
 
04:13:57.830 --> 04:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
since this would only be a bill I mean a
 
04:13:59.330 --> 04:13:59.340 align:start position:0%
law as opposed to a constitutional
 
04:14:01.670 --> 04:14:01.680 align:start position:0%
amendment it would be
 
04:14:03.950 --> 04:14:03.960 align:start position:0%
it would be sort of repeating what the
 
04:14:06.229 --> 04:14:06.239 align:start position:0%
law already is and it would only be
 
04:14:09.229 --> 04:14:09.239 align:start position:0%
valid until the law was changed so I'm
 
04:14:11.389 --> 04:14:11.399 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I see the value of of
 
04:14:13.490 --> 04:14:13.500 align:start position:0%
having it so that that's that's
 
04:14:16.130 --> 04:14:16.140 align:start position:0%
basically why I'm going to vote ICL
 
04:14:17.990 --> 04:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to speak to yes
 
04:14:19.969 --> 04:14:19.979 align:start position:0%
representative Manos
 
04:14:21.830 --> 04:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to respond to
 
04:14:24.769 --> 04:14:24.779 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander it's my
 
04:14:27.889 --> 04:14:27.899 align:start position:0%
understanding that the enforcement in 88
 
04:14:32.450 --> 04:14:32.460 align:start position:0%
only applies to State actors and not to
 
04:14:34.969 --> 04:14:34.979 align:start position:0%
private actors and
 
04:14:36.590 --> 04:14:36.600 align:start position:0%
um that it would not
 
04:14:40.130 --> 04:14:40.140 align:start position:0%
um uh cause a private right of action as
 
04:14:43.610 --> 04:14:43.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:45.950 --> 04:14:45.960 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to speak to it
 
04:14:48.110 --> 04:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
all right um all right so the motion
 
04:14:50.389 --> 04:14:50.399 align:start position:0%
before us then on House Bill 88 is in
 
04:14:52.550 --> 04:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate
 
04:14:54.170 --> 04:14:54.180 align:start position:0%
um and I'll ask the clerk to please call
 
04:14:56.090 --> 04:14:56.100 align:start position:0%
the roll
 
04:14:58.189 --> 04:14:58.199 align:start position:0%

representative savings I would like to

04:16:09.229 --> 04:16:09.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:10.729 --> 04:16:10.739 align:start position:0%
all right would you like to speak to
 
04:16:12.229 --> 04:16:12.239 align:start position:0%
your emotion now representative thank
 
04:16:13.670 --> 04:16:13.680 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chair
 
04:16:16.189 --> 04:16:16.199 align:start position:0%
um let me just start by saying what this
 
04:16:19.070 --> 04:16:19.080 align:start position:0%
bill is not this is not a bill that
 
04:16:21.469 --> 04:16:21.479 align:start position:0%
alters the fetal protection act it
 
04:16:23.150 --> 04:16:23.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't change any of the current
 
04:16:26.570 --> 04:16:26.580 align:start position:0%
restrictions on that were were placed on
 
04:16:27.969 --> 04:16:27.979 align:start position:0%
abortion access
 
04:16:30.229 --> 04:16:30.239 align:start position:0%
although some of us would like in
 
04:16:30.239 --> 04:16:31.429 align:start position:0%
although some of us would like in
another

04:16:31.429 --> 04:16:31.439 align:start position:0%
another
 
04:16:34.729 --> 04:16:34.739 align:start position:0%
bill but um this is a straightforward
 
04:16:38.750 --> 04:16:38.760 align:start position:0%
codification of the right
 
04:16:43.189 --> 04:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
for for abortion care before 24 weeks I
 
04:16:44.870 --> 04:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
think we had heard testimony in the
 
04:16:48.229 --> 04:16:48.239 align:start position:0%
context of the Constitutional cacr-2
 
04:16:52.610 --> 04:16:52.620 align:start position:0%
about what Dobbs did and the questions
 
04:16:55.250 --> 04:16:55.260 align:start position:0%
that left for folks in terms of States
 
04:16:58.370 --> 04:16:58.380 align:start position:0%
and what states are prepared to do or
 
04:17:01.490 --> 04:17:01.500 align:start position:0%
not do and what this does is it puts
 
04:17:03.110 --> 04:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
Clarity around that we acknowledge I
 
04:17:04.550 --> 04:17:04.560 align:start position:0%
think in the context of that debate that
 
04:17:07.189 --> 04:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
the right does exist although it is not
 
04:17:10.550 --> 04:17:10.560 align:start position:0%
in State Statute this simply solves that
 
04:17:13.969 --> 04:17:13.979 align:start position:0%
problem it makes clear what the right is
 
04:17:17.330 --> 04:17:17.340 align:start position:0%
and that it provides that Clarity
 
04:17:17.340 --> 04:17:21.950 align:start position:0%
and that it provides that Clarity
um

04:17:21.950 --> 04:17:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:25.070 --> 04:17:25.080 align:start position:0%
I think that we should remember
 
04:17:28.370 --> 04:17:28.380 align:start position:0%
that the vast majority of granite
 
04:17:32.510 --> 04:17:32.520 align:start position:0%
Staters support access to abortion care
 
04:17:35.870 --> 04:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
and that's what this guarantees it makes
 
04:17:39.170 --> 04:17:39.180 align:start position:0%
it a positive right in State Statute we
 
04:17:41.750 --> 04:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
right now in New Hampshire are an island
 
04:17:44.210 --> 04:17:44.220 align:start position:0%
in New England in terms of
 
04:17:47.030 --> 04:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
recognizing those protections we are the
 
04:17:48.650 --> 04:17:48.660 align:start position:0%
only New England state that doesn't have
 
04:17:50.990 --> 04:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
a statute like this
 
04:17:53.570 --> 04:17:53.580 align:start position:0%
um other states are in fact recognizing
 
04:17:55.969 --> 04:17:55.979 align:start position:0%
the need to clarify the right and in
 
04:17:58.429 --> 04:17:58.439 align:start position:0%
fact if if I recall correctly 16 States
 
04:18:01.250 --> 04:18:01.260 align:start position:0%
since the Dobbs decision have put in
 
04:18:04.550 --> 04:18:04.560 align:start position:0%
similar legislation to this so this is a
 
04:18:06.950 --> 04:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
very straightforward bill I think it
 
04:18:09.650 --> 04:18:09.660 align:start position:0%
simply recognizes what we've already
 
04:18:11.630 --> 04:18:11.640 align:start position:0%
heard in other contexts of other bills
 
04:18:13.189 --> 04:18:13.199 align:start position:0%
and testimony in terms of
 
04:18:15.889 --> 04:18:15.899 align:start position:0%
that the right exists but we don't see
 
04:18:18.050 --> 04:18:18.060 align:start position:0%
it codified in the state law and that's
 
04:18:20.809 --> 04:18:20.819 align:start position:0%
what this bill would do thank you Mr
 
04:18:22.189 --> 04:18:22.199 align:start position:0%
chair all right
 
04:18:25.910 --> 04:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to speak to uh the the
 
04:18:29.389 --> 04:18:29.399 align:start position:0%

04:19:30.960 --> 04:19:33.050 align:start position:0%

04:19:36.050 --> 04:19:36.060 align:start position:0%
yes I just want to apologize for my
 
04:19:39.170 --> 04:19:39.180 align:start position:0%
confusion about HB 88 when I said what
 
04:19:40.969 --> 04:19:40.979 align:start position:0%
Bill are we talking about a lot of
 
04:19:43.250 --> 04:19:43.260 align:start position:0%
people were referring to it as a fetal
 
04:19:45.229 --> 04:19:45.239 align:start position:0%
Life protection act
 
04:19:46.969 --> 04:19:46.979 align:start position:0%
um which is
 
04:19:50.630 --> 04:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
the next bill is 224 repealing the fetal
 
04:19:52.849 --> 04:19:52.859 align:start position:0%
Life protection act so I got a little
 
04:19:54.670 --> 04:19:54.680 align:start position:0%
confused I'm sorry no no no no no
 
04:19:56.929 --> 04:19:56.939 align:start position:0%
apologies necessary it happened it
 
04:19:58.550 --> 04:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
happens to all of us from time to time
 
04:20:00.349 --> 04:20:00.359 align:start position:0%
for sure
 
04:20:03.290 --> 04:20:03.300 align:start position:0%
um all right so next I'm going to turn
 
04:20:03.300 --> 04:20:05.330 align:start position:0%
um all right so next I'm going to turn
to

04:20:05.330 --> 04:20:05.340 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:20:05.340 --> 04:20:06.830 align:start position:0%
to
um

04:20:06.830 --> 04:20:06.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:08.830 --> 04:20:08.840 align:start position:0%
uh House Bill
 
04:20:20.809 --> 04:20:20.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:23.809 --> 04:20:23.819 align:start position:0%
2.4 all right and I'm going to uh
 
04:20:27.130 --> 04:20:27.140 align:start position:0%
recognize myself for a motion of uh
 
04:20:29.330 --> 04:20:29.340 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate representative
 
04:20:31.729 --> 04:20:31.739 align:start position:0%
greeson do you have a second
 
04:20:34.010 --> 04:20:34.020 align:start position:0%
I will second that all right
 
04:20:36.830 --> 04:20:36.840 align:start position:0%
uh and I'd like to speak to uh the
 
04:20:40.729 --> 04:20:40.739 align:start position:0%
motion this this bill proposes to repeal
 
04:20:43.790 --> 04:20:43.800 align:start position:0%
the criminal and civil penalties uh
 
04:20:47.870 --> 04:20:47.880 align:start position:0%
or the fetal life uh protection act
 
04:20:49.269 --> 04:20:49.279 align:start position:0%
and I think
 
04:20:52.910 --> 04:20:52.920 align:start position:0%
basically the reason that I support this
 
04:20:55.849 --> 04:20:55.859 align:start position:0%
that I do not support repealing the
 
04:20:58.490 --> 04:20:58.500 align:start position:0%
criminal civil penalties is it seems to
 
04:21:03.950 --> 04:21:03.960 align:start position:0%
me that they are a vital part of the ACT
 
04:21:07.490 --> 04:21:07.500 align:start position:0%
and I guess what what I would say is the
 
04:21:11.210 --> 04:21:11.220 align:start position:0%
I've heard two arguments advanced
 
04:21:15.110 --> 04:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
in opposition to uh in support of
 
04:21:16.429 --> 04:21:16.439 align:start position:0%
repealing the civil and criminal
 
04:21:16.439 --> 04:21:18.349 align:start position:0%
repealing the civil and criminal
penalties

04:21:18.349 --> 04:21:18.359 align:start position:0%
penalties
 
04:21:19.790 --> 04:21:19.800 align:start position:0%
um and they were made I think very
 
04:21:21.530 --> 04:21:21.540 align:start position:0%
articulately by the people we heard at
 
04:21:22.910 --> 04:21:22.920 align:start position:0%
the hearing most of many medical
 
04:21:22.920 --> 04:21:24.290 align:start position:0%
the hearing most of many medical
professionals

04:21:24.290 --> 04:21:24.300 align:start position:0%
professionals
 
04:21:27.969 --> 04:21:27.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:30.290 --> 04:21:30.300 align:start position:0%
abortions that would be that would
 
04:21:32.389 --> 04:21:32.399 align:start position:0%
subject a doctor to civil or criminal
 
04:21:34.309 --> 04:21:34.319 align:start position:0%
penalties under the ACT don't happen
 
04:21:37.130 --> 04:21:37.140 align:start position:0%
they just never happen
 
04:21:40.070 --> 04:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
so you know the kind of glib answer to
 
04:21:42.650 --> 04:21:42.660 align:start position:0%
that is to say okay so then what's the
 
04:21:44.750 --> 04:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
problem we passed this law there'll be
 
04:21:46.010 --> 04:21:46.020 align:start position:0%
no there'll never be a prosecution
 
04:21:47.510 --> 04:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
there'll never be any civil penalties
 
04:21:49.670 --> 04:21:49.680 align:start position:0%
because these things don't happen
 
04:21:52.610 --> 04:21:52.620 align:start position:0%
that's the kind of short answer to the
 
04:21:55.429 --> 04:21:55.439 align:start position:0%
to the to that assertion but I think
 
04:21:57.050 --> 04:21:57.060 align:start position:0%
that there's more
 
04:21:59.030 --> 04:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
there's a bit more substance to what
 
04:22:01.969 --> 04:22:01.979 align:start position:0%
those people are saying and I think in
 
04:22:05.650 --> 04:22:05.660 align:start position:0%
some respect they have a they have a a
 
04:22:08.809 --> 04:22:08.819 align:start position:0%
valid concern to a point
 
04:22:12.349 --> 04:22:12.359 align:start position:0%
but what they're really asking for is a
 
04:22:14.389 --> 04:22:14.399 align:start position:0%
special is that the law
 
04:22:18.590 --> 04:22:18.600 align:start position:0%
have a special treatment of doctors and
 
04:22:20.150 --> 04:22:20.160 align:start position:0%
here's what I mean by that
 
04:22:22.969 --> 04:22:22.979 align:start position:0%
the argument is that well
 
04:22:26.510 --> 04:22:26.520 align:start position:0%
there could be close cases there might
 
04:22:30.229 --> 04:22:30.239 align:start position:0%
be cases in which a post-24-week
 
04:22:33.849 --> 04:22:33.859 align:start position:0%
abortion was performed and
 
04:22:37.550 --> 04:22:37.560 align:start position:0%
there were circumstances there was some
 
04:22:39.410 --> 04:22:39.420 align:start position:0%
question about the season about the
 
04:22:42.290 --> 04:22:42.300 align:start position:0%
whether the the abortion was necessary
 
04:22:44.990 --> 04:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
to to save the life of the mother or
 
04:22:47.929 --> 04:22:47.939 align:start position:0%
avoid the mother being and having some
 
04:22:50.030 --> 04:22:50.040 align:start position:0%
severe health problem or there could be
 
04:22:53.090 --> 04:22:53.100 align:start position:0%
questions as to the viability of the
 
04:22:56.389 --> 04:22:56.399 align:start position:0%
fetus after 24 weeks
 
04:23:00.469 --> 04:23:00.479 align:start position:0%
um uh and so you know those close
 
04:23:05.030 --> 04:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
questions are a reason for uh
 
04:23:08.750 --> 04:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
for not uh for why we we don't want to
 
04:23:12.410 --> 04:23:12.420 align:start position:0%
uh subject doctors to some somehow the
 
04:23:14.870 --> 04:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
risk that this uh that they would be
 
04:23:14.880 --> 04:23:16.309 align:start position:0%
risk that this uh that they would be
prosecuted

04:23:16.309 --> 04:23:16.319 align:start position:0%
prosecuted
 
04:23:18.469 --> 04:23:18.479 align:start position:0%
there's there's a couple of things that
 
04:23:19.910 --> 04:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
I think are
 
04:23:22.550 --> 04:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
really important to understand about
 
04:23:22.560 --> 04:23:23.389 align:start position:0%
really important to understand about
this

04:23:23.389 --> 04:23:23.399 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:23:26.389 --> 04:23:26.399 align:start position:0%
and that is that
 
04:23:26.399 --> 04:23:26.990 align:start position:0%
and that is that
um

04:23:26.990 --> 04:23:27.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:23:27.000 --> 04:23:29.809 align:start position:0%
um
the

04:23:29.809 --> 04:23:29.819 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:23:32.929 --> 04:23:32.939 align:start position:0%
the the I'll I'll Focus particularly on
 
04:23:34.010 --> 04:23:34.020 align:start position:0%
the criminal penalties because that
 
04:23:35.630 --> 04:23:35.640 align:start position:0%
seemed to be the thing that was a was
 
04:23:39.110 --> 04:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
was uh argued the most strongly it's
 
04:23:41.090 --> 04:23:41.100 align:start position:0%
really important to understand that the
 
04:23:43.010 --> 04:23:43.020 align:start position:0%
criminal penalties under the fetal Life
 
04:23:45.250 --> 04:23:45.260 align:start position:0%
protection act now
 
04:23:49.610 --> 04:23:49.620 align:start position:0%
criminalize knowing conduct that means
 
04:23:52.189 --> 04:23:52.199 align:start position:0%
that the doctor has to know that the
 
04:23:55.070 --> 04:23:55.080 align:start position:0%
fetus above is over 24 weeks and that
 
04:23:58.370 --> 04:23:58.380 align:start position:0%
there's no ex there's no threat to the
 
04:23:59.750 --> 04:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
life of that or the health of the mother
 
04:24:01.550 --> 04:24:01.560 align:start position:0%
or the fetal or there's no question
 
04:24:04.550 --> 04:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
about the uh the the viability of the
 
04:24:08.870 --> 04:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
fetus it it criminalizes knowingly
 
04:24:11.090 --> 04:24:11.100 align:start position:0%
violating the law
 
04:24:14.450 --> 04:24:14.460 align:start position:0%
and to the extent that the doctors are
 
04:24:16.070 --> 04:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
are the Health Care Professionals are
 
04:24:18.530 --> 04:24:18.540 align:start position:0%
arguing well there could be close cases
 
04:24:20.929 --> 04:24:20.939 align:start position:0%
yeah I would agree there could be close
 
04:24:22.729 --> 04:24:22.739 align:start position:0%
cases sometimes
 
04:24:26.090 --> 04:24:26.100 align:start position:0%
why is that a basis for having a special
 
04:24:29.150 --> 04:24:29.160 align:start position:0%
rule for doctors
 
04:24:32.630 --> 04:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
as a lawyer I know from my back from my
 
04:24:34.729 --> 04:24:34.739 align:start position:0%
background and both as a lawyer and as a
 
04:24:36.710 --> 04:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
prosecutor that there are times when
 
04:24:39.110 --> 04:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
when lawyers are charged for example in
 
04:24:41.090 --> 04:24:41.100 align:start position:0%
Securities fraud cases or other things
 
04:24:44.990 --> 04:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
are charged where there the the question
 
04:24:47.150 --> 04:24:47.160 align:start position:0%
that there can be close cases what
 
04:24:49.070 --> 04:24:49.080 align:start position:0%
exactly did the lawyer know about
 
04:24:51.530 --> 04:24:51.540 align:start position:0%
whether this representation was true or
 
04:24:54.590 --> 04:24:54.600 align:start position:0%
not uh that kind of thing
 
04:24:57.110 --> 04:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
uh and yet we don't have a special rule
 
04:24:58.189 --> 04:24:58.199 align:start position:0%
for lawyers
 
04:25:00.349 --> 04:25:00.359 align:start position:0%
more importantly and I think really more
 
04:25:03.110 --> 04:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
more maybe more in in sort of in terms
 
04:25:05.809 --> 04:25:05.819 align:start position:0%
of the news of what people are sort of
 
04:25:08.030 --> 04:25:08.040 align:start position:0%
have in their minds now let's consider
 
04:25:10.969 --> 04:25:10.979 align:start position:0%
the situation of police officers police
 
04:25:14.269 --> 04:25:14.279 align:start position:0%
officers are generally far less Highly
 
04:25:16.309 --> 04:25:16.319 align:start position:0%
Educated than doctors
 
04:25:19.969 --> 04:25:19.979 align:start position:0%
paid considerably less than doctors and
 
04:25:22.130 --> 04:25:22.140 align:start position:0%
are often in a situation where they have
 
04:25:24.710 --> 04:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
to make Split Second decisions where
 
04:25:27.950 --> 04:25:27.960 align:start position:0%
life and death is at stake and yet
 
04:25:31.670 --> 04:25:31.680 align:start position:0%
if they are if the evidence shows that
 
04:25:33.349 --> 04:25:33.359 align:start position:0%
they knowingly
 
04:25:35.689 --> 04:25:35.699 align:start position:0%
knowing let's say knowingly shot someone
 
04:25:38.809 --> 04:25:38.819 align:start position:0%
where there was no valid basis for
 
04:25:40.670 --> 04:25:40.680 align:start position:0%
claiming self-defense even though there
 
04:25:43.010 --> 04:25:43.020 align:start position:0%
might be some issues about well did the
 
04:25:45.710 --> 04:25:45.720 align:start position:0%
person really was a person really
 
04:25:47.510 --> 04:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
running or how big a threat did the
 
04:25:50.990 --> 04:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
person pose did they did the officer
 
04:25:52.910 --> 04:25:52.920 align:start position:0%
really reasonably believe that it was a
 
04:25:54.769 --> 04:25:54.779 align:start position:0%
gun that was being drawn or was it you
 
04:25:57.290 --> 04:25:57.300 align:start position:0%
know it turns out it wasn't we don't
 
04:25:59.090 --> 04:25:59.100 align:start position:0%
have a special rule for for police
 
04:26:02.210 --> 04:26:02.220 align:start position:0%
officers if the if the if the if the
 
04:26:05.149 --> 04:26:05.159 align:start position:0%
evidence will show that they will permit
 
04:26:06.830 --> 04:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
a fact finder to find that they
 
04:26:06.840 --> 04:26:09.050 align:start position:0%
a fact finder to find that they
knowingly

04:26:09.050 --> 04:26:09.060 align:start position:0%
knowingly
 
04:26:13.969 --> 04:26:13.979 align:start position:0%
um uh uh extra used used unjustifiable
 
04:26:16.610 --> 04:26:16.620 align:start position:0%
Force they can be criminally prosecuted
 
04:26:19.250 --> 04:26:19.260 align:start position:0%
and held responsible even though there
 
04:26:22.670 --> 04:26:22.680 align:start position:0%
may be as I just said cases where it's a
 
04:26:24.469 --> 04:26:24.479 align:start position:0%
very close call
 
04:26:27.469 --> 04:26:27.479 align:start position:0%
what the doctors are really asking for
 
04:26:31.490 --> 04:26:31.500 align:start position:0%
here is a special rule they want to have
 
04:26:35.990 --> 04:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
the the law be special as to them and I
 
04:26:38.269 --> 04:26:38.279 align:start position:0%
know I would just make one final point I
 
04:26:40.670 --> 04:26:40.680 align:start position:0%
had a discussion with uh with the right
 
04:26:42.349 --> 04:26:42.359 align:start position:0%
with the ranking member I thought a very
 
04:26:45.050 --> 04:26:45.060 align:start position:0%
a very uh productive discussion I
 
04:26:45.060 --> 04:26:45.769 align:start position:0%
a very uh productive discussion I
thought

04:26:45.769 --> 04:26:45.779 align:start position:0%
thought
 
04:26:47.870 --> 04:26:47.880 align:start position:0%
in which one of the issues that was
 
04:26:50.090 --> 04:26:50.100 align:start position:0%
raised well is well couldn't they be why
 
04:26:51.530 --> 04:26:51.540 align:start position:0%
do you need the criminal penalty
 
04:26:53.450 --> 04:26:53.460 align:start position:0%
couldn't the doctor be prosecuted for
 
04:26:56.750 --> 04:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
murder and the answer to that is no
 
04:27:00.590 --> 04:27:00.600 align:start position:0%
because the because right now it is not
 
04:27:00.600 --> 04:27:01.610 align:start position:0%
because the because right now it is not
murder

04:27:01.610 --> 04:27:01.620 align:start position:0%
murder
 
04:27:05.689 --> 04:27:05.699 align:start position:0%
to abort a a fetus it is that is that is
 
04:27:08.570 --> 04:27:08.580 align:start position:0%
not the crime of murder and nothing and
 
04:27:10.610 --> 04:27:10.620 align:start position:0%
without the criminal penalties in the in
 
04:27:12.830 --> 04:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
the fetal Life protection act there
 
04:27:15.729 --> 04:27:15.739 align:start position:0%
would be no penalty for performing a
 
04:27:18.170 --> 04:27:18.180 align:start position:0%
post-24-week abortion
 
04:27:20.269 --> 04:27:20.279 align:start position:0%
um when there's no exceptions to the
 
04:27:22.189 --> 04:27:22.199 align:start position:0%
fetal Life protection act and when the
 
04:27:24.830 --> 04:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
doctor knows that there's no exception
 
04:27:27.649 --> 04:27:27.659 align:start position:0%
to the fetal Life protection act so for
 
04:27:30.649 --> 04:27:30.659 align:start position:0%
those reasons I think that it would be
 
04:27:32.570 --> 04:27:32.580 align:start position:0%
repealing the criminal penalties would
 
04:27:34.729 --> 04:27:34.739 align:start position:0%
be wellness and the Civil penalties
 
04:27:37.670 --> 04:27:37.680 align:start position:0%
would be a very bad idea and that's why
 
04:27:39.769 --> 04:27:39.779 align:start position:0%
I plan to support Ito
 
04:27:41.210 --> 04:27:41.220 align:start position:0%
other people wish to speak to
 
04:27:44.030 --> 04:27:44.040 align:start position:0%
representative Smith thank you very much
 
04:27:47.149 --> 04:27:47.159 align:start position:0%
and I guess I need to ask your advice
 
04:27:50.929 --> 04:27:50.939 align:start position:0%
I could take a couple of minutes now to
 
04:27:50.939 --> 04:27:52.090 align:start position:0%
I could take a couple of minutes now to
talk

04:27:52.090 --> 04:27:52.100 align:start position:0%
talk
 
04:27:56.929 --> 04:27:56.939 align:start position:0%
or I could not talk now we could vote
 
04:28:00.710 --> 04:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
on the pending motion and then if by
 
04:28:03.410 --> 04:28:03.420 align:start position:0%
some chance the vote ends up to be 10 10
 
04:28:06.110 --> 04:28:06.120 align:start position:0%
I could then speak in more detail should
 
04:28:08.870 --> 04:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
I do that I'll leave it entitled to you
 
04:28:10.910 --> 04:28:10.920 align:start position:0%
I have no whichever you prefer is fine
 
04:28:11.990 --> 04:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
with me
 
04:28:14.990 --> 04:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
well when why don't I speak now so I
 
04:28:18.769 --> 04:28:18.779 align:start position:0%
don't forget what I was going to say uh
 
04:28:18.779 --> 04:28:20.149 align:start position:0%
don't forget what I was going to say uh
um

04:28:20.149 --> 04:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:28:23.750 --> 04:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
I listened to everything you said
 
04:28:26.870 --> 04:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
and it seemed to me that you were making
 
04:28:31.969 --> 04:28:31.979 align:start position:0%
a very strong argument in favor of this
 
04:28:33.889 --> 04:28:33.899 align:start position:0%
bill until you got to the conclusion
 
04:28:37.070 --> 04:28:37.080 align:start position:0%
when you said you weren't because what
 
04:28:42.649 --> 04:28:42.659 align:start position:0%
this bill does is say that we should not
 
04:28:45.910 --> 04:28:45.920 align:start position:0%
single out doctors we should not
 
04:28:49.429 --> 04:28:49.439 align:start position:0%
treat doctors in a different in a way
 
04:28:50.870 --> 04:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
that's different
 
04:28:55.910 --> 04:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
from the way we treat lawyers or anybody
 
04:28:55.920 --> 04:28:57.010 align:start position:0%
from the way we treat lawyers or anybody
else

04:28:57.010 --> 04:28:57.020 align:start position:0%
else
 
04:29:01.870 --> 04:29:01.880 align:start position:0%
by recognizing that there is no need
 
04:29:05.870 --> 04:29:05.880 align:start position:0%
to indicate any difference in how a
 
04:29:10.610 --> 04:29:10.620 align:start position:0%
doctor should be treated let me you know
 
04:29:13.309 --> 04:29:13.319 align:start position:0%
we all play a lot of different roles
 
04:29:16.030 --> 04:29:16.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes sequentially
 
04:29:16.040 --> 04:29:18.070 align:start position:0%
sometimes sequentially
sometimes

04:29:18.070 --> 04:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
sometimes
 
04:29:21.710 --> 04:29:21.720 align:start position:0%
simultaneously whether we're an advocate
 
04:29:24.170 --> 04:29:24.180 align:start position:0%
a legislator an administrator an
 
04:29:24.180 --> 04:29:26.389 align:start position:0%
a legislator an administrator an
adjudicator

04:29:26.389 --> 04:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
adjudicator
 
04:29:29.510 --> 04:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
um and we have to be careful always to
 
04:29:33.170 --> 04:29:33.180 align:start position:0%
wear the appropriate hat in a particular
 
04:29:35.809 --> 04:29:35.819 align:start position:0%
set of circles is one of my favorite
 
04:29:37.610 --> 04:29:37.620 align:start position:0%
examples and those of you on the
 
04:29:40.010 --> 04:29:40.020 align:start position:0%
committee will laugh is we sit here and
 
04:29:45.290 --> 04:29:45.300 align:start position:0%
Conquer and we oppose the budget
 
04:29:47.689 --> 04:29:47.699 align:start position:0%
um or we we sit here and we support the
 
04:29:49.550 --> 04:29:49.560 align:start position:0%
budget or opposed it whatever but the
 
04:29:52.729 --> 04:29:52.739 align:start position:0%
point is we pass the budget that has a
 
04:29:55.670 --> 04:29:55.680 align:start position:0%
certain amount of money in it
 
04:29:59.870 --> 04:29:59.880 align:start position:0%
and then we leave here and we go to our
 
04:30:03.590 --> 04:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
counties where we act as the legislative
 
04:30:07.309 --> 04:30:07.319 align:start position:0%
body in the county and we
 
04:30:11.030 --> 04:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
shout obscenities at the legislators in
 
04:30:13.010 --> 04:30:13.020 align:start position:0%
Concord who haven't given us enough
 
04:30:14.750 --> 04:30:14.760 align:start position:0%
money for what we want to do in the
 
04:30:17.090 --> 04:30:17.100 align:start position:0%
county we're the same people but we're
 
04:30:18.710 --> 04:30:18.720 align:start position:0%
wearing different hats and we're looking
 
04:30:21.290 --> 04:30:21.300 align:start position:0%
at it in different circumstances
 
04:30:24.349 --> 04:30:24.359 align:start position:0%
and my point is that the issue here is
 
04:30:26.630 --> 04:30:26.640 align:start position:0%
that we are not judges
 
04:30:28.969 --> 04:30:28.979 align:start position:0%
we are not adjudicators we are
 
04:30:31.849 --> 04:30:31.859 align:start position:0%
legislators now
 
04:30:34.269 --> 04:30:34.279 align:start position:0%
there are many examples
 
04:30:38.090 --> 04:30:38.100 align:start position:0%
of actions not being criminalized but
 
04:30:39.790 --> 04:30:39.800 align:start position:0%
still being
 
04:30:43.250 --> 04:30:43.260 align:start position:0%
subject to broader criminal penalties I
 
04:30:46.070 --> 04:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
I mentioned to to the chair you're
 
04:30:48.349 --> 04:30:48.359 align:start position:0%
driving along you spill your coffee
 
04:30:50.450 --> 04:30:50.460 align:start position:0%
in the car
 
04:30:52.610 --> 04:30:52.620 align:start position:0%
you reach over because you're going to
 
04:30:54.290 --> 04:30:54.300 align:start position:0%
wipe up the coffee because you know it's
 
04:30:56.090 --> 04:30:56.100 align:start position:0%
going to make a mess on the Upholstery
 
04:30:58.610 --> 04:30:58.620 align:start position:0%
and when you do that you get into an
 
04:30:58.620 --> 04:31:00.050 align:start position:0%
and when you do that you get into an
accident

04:31:00.050 --> 04:31:00.060 align:start position:0%
accident
 
04:31:02.870 --> 04:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
there is nothing in the law
 
04:31:05.929 --> 04:31:05.939 align:start position:0%
that says you should not be cleaning up
 
04:31:07.849 --> 04:31:07.859 align:start position:0%
the coffee you spilled
 
04:31:10.070 --> 04:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
but there is
 
04:31:13.729 --> 04:31:13.739 align:start position:0%
a reckless driving law and you've
 
04:31:16.729 --> 04:31:16.739 align:start position:0%
committed reckless driving and just
 
04:31:18.649 --> 04:31:18.659 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't say in reckless
 
04:31:21.290 --> 04:31:21.300 align:start position:0%
driving that that includes if you pick
 
04:31:23.689 --> 04:31:23.699 align:start position:0%
if you clean up spilled coffee you're
 
04:31:26.570 --> 04:31:26.580 align:start position:0%
still subject to that there's no law
 
04:31:28.969 --> 04:31:28.979 align:start position:0%
against stealing jewelry
 
04:31:31.550 --> 04:31:31.560 align:start position:0%
but there is law against stealing there
 
04:31:38.210 --> 04:31:38.220 align:start position:0%
is nothing in the law that says clients
 
04:31:40.910 --> 04:31:40.920 align:start position:0%
property is theirs and attorneys
 
04:31:43.490 --> 04:31:43.500 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be stolen from it
 
04:31:45.769 --> 04:31:45.779 align:start position:0%
um except that their theft statutes
 
04:31:48.530 --> 04:31:48.540 align:start position:0%
statutes and more than that
 
04:31:50.570 --> 04:31:50.580 align:start position:0%
they are the rules of professional
 
04:31:53.990 --> 04:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
responsibility and so a lawyer who
 
04:31:57.050 --> 04:31:57.060 align:start position:0%
decides to steal from his client
 
04:31:57.060 --> 04:31:57.950 align:start position:0%
decides to steal from his client
um

04:31:57.950 --> 04:31:57.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:32:00.830 --> 04:32:00.840 align:start position:0%
not only is subject to criminal law but
 
04:32:02.750 --> 04:32:02.760 align:start position:0%
he's also subject to something that
 
04:32:05.870 --> 04:32:05.880 align:start position:0%
might be much more serious to him or to
 
04:32:05.880 --> 04:32:06.649 align:start position:0%
might be much more serious to him or to
her

04:32:06.649 --> 04:32:06.659 align:start position:0%
her
 
04:32:10.610 --> 04:32:10.620 align:start position:0%
uh and that is in fact losing his
 
04:32:13.309 --> 04:32:13.319 align:start position:0%
license being denied his right to to
 
04:32:14.510 --> 04:32:14.520 align:start position:0%
earn a living
 
04:32:17.929 --> 04:32:17.939 align:start position:0%
so an attorney violating these rules is
 
04:32:20.210 --> 04:32:20.220 align:start position:0%
in real trouble the same thing is true
 
04:32:24.950 --> 04:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
about a doctor a doctor who violates the
 
04:32:28.370 --> 04:32:28.380 align:start position:0%
their rules the licensure all of the
 
04:32:30.830 --> 04:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
things that are required of them
 
04:32:33.710 --> 04:32:33.720 align:start position:0%
um is subject to the discipline
 
04:32:36.469 --> 04:32:36.479 align:start position:0%
um within the medical community that
 
04:32:38.689 --> 04:32:38.699 align:start position:0%
could cost him or her his license his
 
04:32:41.929 --> 04:32:41.939 align:start position:0%
ability to function whatever and
 
04:32:41.939 --> 04:32:43.070 align:start position:0%
ability to function whatever and
um

04:32:43.070 --> 04:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:32:46.550 --> 04:32:46.560 align:start position:0%
and that already exists we do not need
 
04:32:51.710 --> 04:32:51.720 align:start position:0%
something Superfluous to say and we also
 
04:32:51.720 --> 04:32:52.910 align:start position:0%
something Superfluous to say and we also
want

04:32:52.910 --> 04:32:52.920 align:start position:0%
want
 
04:32:55.130 --> 04:32:55.140 align:start position:0%
um lawyers doctors to know that they
 
04:32:57.290 --> 04:32:57.300 align:start position:0%
shouldn't do anything against the law
 
04:32:57.300 --> 04:32:59.269 align:start position:0%
shouldn't do anything against the law
uh

04:32:59.269 --> 04:32:59.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:33:03.649 --> 04:33:03.659 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:06.949 --> 04:33:06.959 align:start position:0%
we are troubled by these bills because
 
04:33:09.470 --> 04:33:09.480 align:start position:0%
we don't know exactly how to get from
 
04:33:11.929 --> 04:33:11.939 align:start position:0%
where we are to where we want to go
 
04:33:15.349 --> 04:33:15.359 align:start position:0%
we um had a split just a little bit ago
 
04:33:17.150 --> 04:33:17.160 align:start position:0%
about asking
 
04:33:20.029 --> 04:33:20.039 align:start position:0%
our citizens how they feel about this
 
04:33:22.131 --> 04:33:22.141 align:start position:0%
issue and we'll have to see what happens
 
04:33:24.949 --> 04:33:24.959 align:start position:0%
when that bill goes this bill is an
 
04:33:28.010 --> 04:33:28.020 align:start position:0%
attempt to just undo something that
 
04:33:30.949 --> 04:33:30.959 align:start position:0%
never should have been procedurally
 
04:33:33.070 --> 04:33:33.080 align:start position:0%
in House Bill 2
 
04:33:35.269 --> 04:33:35.279 align:start position:0%
understanding that
 
04:33:39.109 --> 04:33:39.119 align:start position:0%
in its place will be other kinds of
 
04:33:41.570 --> 04:33:41.580 align:start position:0%
limitation language for example the
 
04:33:45.910 --> 04:33:45.920 align:start position:0%
language in 88 which keeps in place
 
04:33:51.470 --> 04:33:51.480 align:start position:0%
those those penalties so I ask you to
 
04:33:51.480 --> 04:33:53.570 align:start position:0%
those those penalties so I ask you to
overturn

04:33:53.570 --> 04:33:53.580 align:start position:0%
overturn
 
04:33:53.580 --> 04:33:54.109 align:start position:0%
overturn
um

04:33:54.109 --> 04:33:54.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:57.349 --> 04:33:57.359 align:start position:0%
or to not support the itl so that
 
04:33:59.689 --> 04:33:59.699 align:start position:0%
another motion could be made
 
04:34:01.970 --> 04:34:01.980 align:start position:0%
are there other people wish to speak yes
 
04:34:04.670 --> 04:34:04.680 align:start position:0%
representative Macbeth thank you
 
04:34:06.709 --> 04:34:06.719 align:start position:0%
I want to speak very briefly but I
 
04:34:09.289 --> 04:34:09.299 align:start position:0%
really do feel doctors are in a
 
04:34:10.429 --> 04:34:10.439 align:start position:0%
Physicians and Medical Care
 
04:34:12.310 --> 04:34:12.320 align:start position:0%
Professionals are in a different place
 
04:34:15.410 --> 04:34:15.420 align:start position:0%
they are making life and death decisions
 
04:34:17.330 --> 04:34:17.340 align:start position:0%
all the time for us
 
04:34:20.150 --> 04:34:20.160 align:start position:0%
those of us that have had Parents age we
 
04:34:22.189 --> 04:34:22.199 align:start position:0%
know if they go through bypass surgery
 
04:34:23.869 --> 04:34:23.879 align:start position:0%
some of our parents go through fine
 
04:34:26.209 --> 04:34:26.219 align:start position:0%
others have strokes and and
 
04:34:27.890 --> 04:34:27.900 align:start position:0%
complications and it wasn't the
 
04:34:29.990 --> 04:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
physician's fault or the surgeon's fault
 
04:34:31.970 --> 04:34:31.980 align:start position:0%
other of us have gone to the dentist and
 
04:34:33.890 --> 04:34:33.900 align:start position:0%
you've had a tooth removed some of you
 
04:34:36.109 --> 04:34:36.119 align:start position:0%
get dry Pockets some of you you know gum
 
04:34:38.929 --> 04:34:38.939 align:start position:0%
surgery it repairs it's not it's not a
 
04:34:41.269 --> 04:34:41.279 align:start position:0%
black and white issue medical personnel
 
04:34:44.390 --> 04:34:44.400 align:start position:0%
make their best decisions based on what
 
04:34:48.230 --> 04:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
they see at the time and I I want my
 
04:34:50.631 --> 04:34:50.641 align:start position:0%
providers to give me care and to give
 
04:34:53.029 --> 04:34:53.039 align:start position:0%
you care without the chilling effect of
 
04:34:55.730 --> 04:34:55.740 align:start position:0%
thinking oh my God the record says the
 
04:34:58.490 --> 04:34:58.500 align:start position:0%
woman's 40 24 weeks pregnant but we know
 
04:35:00.051 --> 04:35:00.061 align:start position:0%
there's this gray area here or it does
 
04:35:01.970 --> 04:35:01.980 align:start position:0%
or doesn't but I'll just say it does and
 
04:35:03.470 --> 04:35:03.480 align:start position:0%
she's been in a traumatic car accident
 
04:35:06.470 --> 04:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
and finally they've stabilized her and
 
04:35:08.449 --> 04:35:08.459 align:start position:0%
now the Obstetricians come in and they
 
04:35:10.609 --> 04:35:10.619 align:start position:0%
say God can we save the baby we know the
 
04:35:11.570 --> 04:35:11.580 align:start position:0%
baby's heart's still beating the
 
04:35:13.010 --> 04:35:13.020 align:start position:0%
mother's still alive but she's you know
 
04:35:14.209 --> 04:35:14.219 align:start position:0%
her heart's going to crash any minute
 
04:35:16.609 --> 04:35:16.619 align:start position:0%
and so guess what there's a lot of
 
04:35:18.709 --> 04:35:18.719 align:start position:0%
different ways to do C-section do we rip
 
04:35:20.750 --> 04:35:20.760 align:start position:0%
it open so that she never can have a
 
04:35:22.490 --> 04:35:22.500 align:start position:0%
baby again but we save the baby because
 
04:35:25.250 --> 04:35:25.260 align:start position:0%
the record says 24 weeks or do we go a
 
04:35:27.051 --> 04:35:27.061 align:start position:0%
little bit longer take the C-section out
 
04:35:29.090 --> 04:35:29.100 align:start position:0%
of the front hopefully the baby will
 
04:35:30.890 --> 04:35:30.900 align:start position:0%
make it and the mother will make it and
 
04:35:32.349 --> 04:35:32.359 align:start position:0%
the week and she can have children again
 
04:35:36.051 --> 04:35:36.061 align:start position:0%
that decision I want my caretakers to
 
04:35:37.609 --> 04:35:37.619 align:start position:0%
make without the chilling effect to
 
04:35:40.189 --> 04:35:40.199 align:start position:0%
think oh you know what somebody's going
 
04:35:42.230 --> 04:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
to sue me because it's 24 weeks and you
 
04:35:43.910 --> 04:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
know what knowing guess how we decide
 
04:35:45.890 --> 04:35:45.900 align:start position:0%
what knowing is you have to be in court
 
04:35:47.929 --> 04:35:47.939 align:start position:0%
and decide what knowing is that's that's
 
04:35:50.570 --> 04:35:50.580 align:start position:0%
for the triers of fact so it's not oh
 
04:35:53.269 --> 04:35:53.279 align:start position:0%
yeah we know we know no you know because
 
04:35:54.949 --> 04:35:54.959 align:start position:0%
you go to court and if anybody's been
 
04:35:57.109 --> 04:35:57.119 align:start position:0%
sued personally for what they've tried
 
04:35:59.510 --> 04:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
their best to do it's a horrible process
 
04:36:01.189 --> 04:36:01.199 align:start position:0%
and we don't have enough health care
 
04:36:03.470 --> 04:36:03.480 align:start position:0%
workers today in New Hampshire please
 
04:36:06.051 --> 04:36:06.061 align:start position:0%
this is different Health Care is
 
04:36:07.970 --> 04:36:07.980 align:start position:0%
different let's let the regulatory
 
04:36:11.029 --> 04:36:11.039 align:start position:0%
boards sponsor I mean regulate our
 
04:36:12.230 --> 04:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
Health Care Professionals and our
 
04:36:13.609 --> 04:36:13.619 align:start position:0%
physicians like they're doing they've
 
04:36:15.109 --> 04:36:15.119 align:start position:0%
been doing
 
04:36:17.150 --> 04:36:17.160 align:start position:0%
um and and give me the right for
 
04:36:19.131 --> 04:36:19.141 align:start position:0%
position to make a decision in the gray
 
04:36:21.709 --> 04:36:21.719 align:start position:0%
area within their what they think is
 
04:36:23.929 --> 04:36:23.939 align:start position:0%
best for me and my child and my family
 
04:36:27.650 --> 04:36:27.660 align:start position:0%
and not what you all thought was best
 
04:36:30.010 --> 04:36:30.020 align:start position:0%
other Comics representative
 
04:36:33.289 --> 04:36:33.299 align:start position:0%
yeah just briefly it's a similar comment
 
04:36:34.369 --> 04:36:34.379 align:start position:0%
to what I made when we were talking
 
04:36:36.230 --> 04:36:36.240 align:start position:0%
about the Constitutional Amendment bill
 
04:36:38.869 --> 04:36:38.879 align:start position:0%
um you know the healthcare industry
 
04:36:41.929 --> 04:36:41.939 align:start position:0%
is a successfully self-regulating
 
04:36:41.939 --> 04:36:44.090 align:start position:0%
is a successfully self-regulating
industry

04:36:44.090 --> 04:36:44.100 align:start position:0%
industry
 
04:36:46.789 --> 04:36:46.799 align:start position:0%
um the care that's provided is governed
 
04:36:49.310 --> 04:36:49.320 align:start position:0%
by an oath that you take all the way
 
04:36:52.490 --> 04:36:52.500 align:start position:0%
through to your licensing all the way
 
04:36:54.650 --> 04:36:54.660 align:start position:0%
through to
 
04:36:54.660 --> 04:36:55.189 align:start position:0%
through to
um

04:36:55.189 --> 04:36:55.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:36:57.051 --> 04:36:57.061 align:start position:0%
the ethics boards and everything else
 
04:36:59.510 --> 04:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
within the construct of of the care
 
04:37:01.910 --> 04:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
that's delivered standards of care and
 
04:37:05.390 --> 04:37:05.400 align:start position:0%
malpractice and other things the idea
 
04:37:09.051 --> 04:37:09.061 align:start position:0%
of creating a uh law around something
 
04:37:11.390 --> 04:37:11.400 align:start position:0%
that essentially we all know the
 
04:37:13.789 --> 04:37:13.799 align:start position:0%
industry does not and would not allow to
 
04:37:16.730 --> 04:37:16.740 align:start position:0%
take place and then to basically Place
 
04:37:16.740 --> 04:37:18.410 align:start position:0%
take place and then to basically Place
heavy

04:37:18.410 --> 04:37:18.420 align:start position:0%
heavy
 
04:37:21.830 --> 04:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
criminal civil and licensure penalties
 
04:37:25.250 --> 04:37:25.260 align:start position:0%
on that essentially non-existent
 
04:37:28.310 --> 04:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
condition that was was legislated into
 
04:37:31.429 --> 04:37:31.439 align:start position:0%
existence for the purpose of
 
04:37:33.709 --> 04:37:33.719 align:start position:0%
I won't tell you what the purpose is
 
04:37:37.490 --> 04:37:37.500 align:start position:0%
um you know seems to be a vast intrusion
 
04:37:40.970 --> 04:37:40.980 align:start position:0%
into what I think we all agree is a good
 
04:37:42.709 --> 04:37:42.719 align:start position:0%
way for medicine to operate which is
 
04:37:45.830 --> 04:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
without the hand of the legislature
 
04:37:49.131 --> 04:37:49.141 align:start position:0%
um involved and and
 
04:37:51.590 --> 04:37:51.600 align:start position:0%
just adding the penalties on top of the
 
04:37:53.750 --> 04:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
legislation makes it
 
04:37:55.910 --> 04:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
um considerably more daunting and and
 
04:37:58.131 --> 04:37:58.141 align:start position:0%
speaking to what representative Macbeth
 
04:38:02.750 --> 04:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
said uh also also puts us as an outlier
 
04:38:05.090 --> 04:38:05.100 align:start position:0%
as far as retracting qualified
 
04:38:05.100 --> 04:38:06.551 align:start position:0%
as far as retracting qualified
Physicians

04:38:06.551 --> 04:38:06.561 align:start position:0%
Physicians
 
04:38:10.070 --> 04:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
other uh yes representative Perez thank
 
04:38:10.080 --> 04:38:10.730 align:start position:0%
other uh yes representative Perez thank
you

04:38:10.730 --> 04:38:10.740 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:38:13.010 --> 04:38:13.020 align:start position:0%
I had every intention of keeping my
 
04:38:15.470 --> 04:38:15.480 align:start position:0%
mouth shut through this but I can't I'm
 
04:38:17.090 --> 04:38:17.100 align:start position:0%
sorry I worked in the healthcare
 
04:38:19.689 --> 04:38:19.699 align:start position:0%
profession in the health care profession
 
04:38:22.670 --> 04:38:22.680 align:start position:0%
for 42 years I trained at Mass General
 
04:38:25.609 --> 04:38:25.619 align:start position:0%
in Boston I worked the emergency room I
 
04:38:27.650 --> 04:38:27.660 align:start position:0%
worked the recovery room I worked
 
04:38:31.429 --> 04:38:31.439 align:start position:0%
intensive care I worked Cardiac Care
 
04:38:37.070 --> 04:38:37.080 align:start position:0%
we need this law doctors are not perfect
 
04:38:39.769 --> 04:38:39.779 align:start position:0%
just like police are not perfect
 
04:38:42.730 --> 04:38:42.740 align:start position:0%
I many times in my career
 
04:38:46.670 --> 04:38:46.680 align:start position:0%
refused a doctor's order refused a
 
04:38:49.429 --> 04:38:49.439 align:start position:0%
doctor's order because I knew it was not
 
04:38:52.010 --> 04:38:52.020 align:start position:0%
in the best interest of the patient
 
04:38:56.090 --> 04:38:56.100 align:start position:0%
refused I walked out I lost a job
 
04:38:58.369 --> 04:38:58.379 align:start position:0%
because I walked out because you know
 
04:39:00.349 --> 04:39:00.359 align:start position:0%
you're not allowed to speak up against a
 
04:39:04.250 --> 04:39:04.260 align:start position:0%
doctor and doctors stick together
 
04:39:07.990 --> 04:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
they are not perfect and this is a very
 
04:39:11.631 --> 04:39:11.641 align:start position:0%
precarious situation when we are dealing
 
04:39:14.170 --> 04:39:14.180 align:start position:0%
with the
 
04:39:17.529 --> 04:39:17.539 align:start position:0%
abortions at 24 weeks at 50 I mean
 
04:39:19.730 --> 04:39:19.740 align:start position:0%
Planned Parenthood doesn't do abortions
 
04:39:21.590 --> 04:39:21.600 align:start position:0%
over 15 weeks
 
04:39:24.650 --> 04:39:24.660 align:start position:0%
I would love to trust everybody who's in
 
04:39:29.390 --> 04:39:29.400 align:start position:0%
every profession but we cannot the fetal
 
04:39:31.670 --> 04:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
the fetus if you want to call it a fetus
 
04:39:34.250 --> 04:39:34.260 align:start position:0%
I call it a child they need protection
 
04:39:37.690 --> 04:39:37.700 align:start position:0%
too so I will
 
04:39:41.810 --> 04:39:41.820 align:start position:0%
not a support passing this bill as a
 
04:39:44.630 --> 04:39:44.640 align:start position:0%
42-year plus health care professional
 
04:39:48.288 --> 04:39:48.298 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:50.930 --> 04:39:50.940 align:start position:0%
other comments yes representative
 
04:39:50.940 --> 04:39:51.890 align:start position:0%
other comments yes representative
Staples

04:39:51.890 --> 04:39:51.900 align:start position:0%
Staples
 
04:39:51.900 --> 04:39:54.490 align:start position:0%
Staples
yeah

04:39:54.490 --> 04:39:54.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:59.690 --> 04:39:59.700 align:start position:0%
in terms of the quality of law
 
04:40:04.010 --> 04:40:04.020 align:start position:0%
a law without enforcement or penalty
 
04:40:07.190 --> 04:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
is like a bucket with a hole in it
 
04:40:09.770 --> 04:40:09.780 align:start position:0%
like a country and western song says it
 
04:40:13.310 --> 04:40:13.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:15.590 --> 04:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
it's not serving a purpose
 
04:40:17.708 --> 04:40:17.718 align:start position:0%
and worse than that
 
04:40:20.630 --> 04:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
it's inadequate
 
04:40:23.150 --> 04:40:23.160 align:start position:0%
bad legislation
 
04:40:25.550 --> 04:40:25.560 align:start position:0%
and it would be better to actually
 
04:40:28.788 --> 04:40:28.798 align:start position:0%
repeal the law instead of making it
 
04:40:34.310 --> 04:40:34.320 align:start position:0%
such an inadequate inept structure
 
04:40:36.410 --> 04:40:36.420 align:start position:0%
we profane the law when we do things
 
04:40:38.690 --> 04:40:38.700 align:start position:0%
like that as much as we profane it when
 
04:40:42.288 --> 04:40:42.298 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:42.298 --> 04:40:43.490 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:40:43.490 --> 04:40:43.500 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:40:48.050 --> 04:40:48.060 align:start position:0%
I've got to support the itl
 
04:40:48.060 --> 04:40:48.708 align:start position:0%
I've got to support the itl
um

04:40:48.708 --> 04:40:48.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:52.130 --> 04:40:52.140 align:start position:0%
and even though I'm pro-life and uh
 
04:40:52.140 --> 04:40:53.810 align:start position:0%
and even though I'm pro-life and uh
and

04:40:53.810 --> 04:40:53.820 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:40:56.868 --> 04:40:56.878 align:start position:0%
don't like particular bills like like
 
04:41:00.650 --> 04:41:00.660 align:start position:0%
this or like the one to repeal it
 
04:41:03.050 --> 04:41:03.060 align:start position:0%
The Better Effort would be to repeal the
 
04:41:05.448 --> 04:41:05.458 align:start position:0%
law instead of making it Hollow
 
04:41:07.550 --> 04:41:07.560 align:start position:0%
although I won't support the repeal
 
04:41:07.560 --> 04:41:09.550 align:start position:0%
although I won't support the repeal
either

04:41:09.550 --> 04:41:09.560 align:start position:0%
either
 
04:41:13.010 --> 04:41:13.020 align:start position:0%
yes representative cuta
 
04:41:14.930 --> 04:41:14.940 align:start position:0%
so I know that there was talk about you
 
04:41:17.390 --> 04:41:17.400 align:start position:0%
know just keeping the the punishments
 
04:41:20.208 --> 04:41:20.218 align:start position:0%
for everybody equal and not having one
 
04:41:22.128 --> 04:41:22.138 align:start position:0%
specifically for Physicians but I did
 
04:41:25.730 --> 04:41:25.740 align:start position:0%
want to point out that in 2017 we had
 
04:41:30.948 --> 04:41:30.958 align:start position:0%
amended RSA 630 colon 1 for first degree
 
04:41:34.430 --> 04:41:34.440 align:start position:0%
murder to allow for the prosecution of
 
04:41:37.368 --> 04:41:37.378 align:start position:0%
somebody who kills a fetus that could be
 
04:41:38.690 --> 04:41:38.700 align:start position:0%
you know in a car accident or
 
04:41:42.670 --> 04:41:42.680 align:start position:0%
intentionally however in that law we did
 
04:41:45.470 --> 04:41:45.480 align:start position:0%
explicitly state that it would not
 
04:41:48.530 --> 04:41:48.540 align:start position:0%
include an act performed by a physician
 
04:41:50.270 --> 04:41:50.280 align:start position:0%
including the termination of a pregnancy
 
04:41:50.280 --> 04:41:52.368 align:start position:0%
including the termination of a pregnancy
so

04:41:52.368 --> 04:41:52.378 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:41:55.430 --> 04:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
because that's precluded from the
 
04:41:58.250 --> 04:41:58.260 align:start position:0%
existing statute to be able to prosecute
 
04:41:58.260 --> 04:41:59.628 align:start position:0%
existing statute to be able to prosecute
for

04:41:59.628 --> 04:41:59.638 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:41:59.638 --> 04:42:01.910 align:start position:0%
for
murder

04:42:01.910 --> 04:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
murder
 
04:42:03.830 --> 04:42:03.840 align:start position:0%
we don't have an existing thing without
 
04:42:05.330 --> 04:42:05.340 align:start position:0%
this we don't have any existing
 
04:42:08.868 --> 04:42:08.878 align:start position:0%
penalties for knowingly terminating a
 
04:42:13.070 --> 04:42:13.080 align:start position:0%
viable baby even if it was at 38 weeks
 
04:42:15.770 --> 04:42:15.780 align:start position:0%
thank you other other comments yes
 
04:42:17.390 --> 04:42:17.400 align:start position:0%
representative Manos
 
04:42:19.850 --> 04:42:19.860 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I just wanted to
 
04:42:23.510 --> 04:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
point out that the um the statute that
 
04:42:26.150 --> 04:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
we're looking at says any health care
 
04:42:29.270 --> 04:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
provider so this is not a statute that
 
04:42:32.208 --> 04:42:32.218 align:start position:0%
that applies only specifically to
 
04:42:34.810 --> 04:42:34.820 align:start position:0%
Physicians and doctors
 
04:42:37.610 --> 04:42:37.620 align:start position:0%
it applies to any health care provider
 
04:42:40.128 --> 04:42:40.138 align:start position:0%
the other thing I wanted to point out is
 
04:42:43.430 --> 04:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
that it is correct as as you said Mr
 
04:42:46.550 --> 04:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
chair that this applies to to knowing
 
04:42:50.150 --> 04:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
Behavior or to a knowing act but it also
 
04:42:52.910 --> 04:42:52.920 align:start position:0%
says or consciously disregards a
 
04:42:55.368 --> 04:42:55.378 align:start position:0%
substantial risk that the fetus has a
 
04:42:58.910 --> 04:42:58.920 align:start position:0%
gestational age of at least 24 weeks and
 
04:43:02.708 --> 04:43:02.718 align:start position:0%
I think that's a very very uh slippery
 
04:43:07.430 --> 04:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
precarious uh standard and it puts
 
04:43:11.170 --> 04:43:11.180 align:start position:0%
health care providers in a position of
 
04:43:15.708 --> 04:43:15.718 align:start position:0%
uncertainty in my in my view and
 
04:43:15.718 --> 04:43:16.310 align:start position:0%
uncertainty in my in my view and
um

04:43:16.310 --> 04:43:16.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:18.708 --> 04:43:18.718 align:start position:0%
obviously the only point of a criminal
 
04:43:23.150 --> 04:43:23.160 align:start position:0%
penalty is to either uh punish Behavior
 
04:43:27.410 --> 04:43:27.420 align:start position:0%
or to discourage behavior and I think we
 
04:43:29.628 --> 04:43:29.638 align:start position:0%
do not want to do that
 
04:43:33.410 --> 04:43:33.420 align:start position:0%
um and so I strongly oppose the itl
 
04:43:37.250 --> 04:43:37.260 align:start position:0%
motion I think this statute is Broad it
 
04:43:40.250 --> 04:43:40.260 align:start position:0%
discourages Behavior it discourages
 
04:43:42.110 --> 04:43:42.120 align:start position:0%
Health Care treatment from health care
 
04:43:47.090 --> 04:43:47.100 align:start position:0%
providers that should be protected
 
04:43:50.390 --> 04:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
other comments so I guess the only thing
 
04:43:51.590 --> 04:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
I would say in response to
 
04:43:53.930 --> 04:43:53.940 align:start position:0%
representative Manos to your point is I
 
04:43:57.050 --> 04:43:57.060 align:start position:0%
it it seems to me that that um that
 
04:43:59.030 --> 04:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
consciously disregards language and I
 
04:44:01.070 --> 04:44:01.080 align:start position:0%
think I I if I recall correctly I think
 
04:44:03.170 --> 04:44:03.180 align:start position:0%
I had some at least some role in the in
 
04:44:05.150 --> 04:44:05.160 align:start position:0%
adding that language into it when the
 
04:44:06.470 --> 04:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
criminal penalty statute was under
 
04:44:09.170 --> 04:44:09.180 align:start position:0%
consideration basically that in there's
 
04:44:11.510 --> 04:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
a well recognized Doctrine in the law of
 
04:44:14.628 --> 04:44:14.638 align:start position:0%
willful blindness that basically says if
 
04:44:17.690 --> 04:44:17.700 align:start position:0%
you you can't if if you are if you are
 
04:44:19.670 --> 04:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
an actor
 
04:44:22.250 --> 04:44:22.260 align:start position:0%
um you can't just close your eyes to
 
04:44:25.128 --> 04:44:25.138 align:start position:0%
what is uh to what's right in front of
 
04:44:27.830 --> 04:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
you and if you do do that then you can't
 
04:44:29.690 --> 04:44:29.700 align:start position:0%
say well I didn't act knowingly because
 
04:44:32.030 --> 04:44:32.040 align:start position:0%
I because I close my eyes I didn't know
 
04:44:34.310 --> 04:44:34.320 align:start position:0%
I didn't know the light was red because
 
04:44:36.890 --> 04:44:36.900 align:start position:0%
I closed my eyes you can't do that the
 
04:44:40.368 --> 04:44:40.378 align:start position:0%
law says when you when that that that's
 
04:44:43.010 --> 04:44:43.020 align:start position:0%
that concept of willful blindness and
 
04:44:44.628 --> 04:44:44.638 align:start position:0%
that's what that's designed to capture
 
04:44:46.670 --> 04:44:46.680 align:start position:0%
and I think it captures it entirely
 
04:44:49.190 --> 04:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
appropriately the only other point that
 
04:44:51.170 --> 04:44:51.180 align:start position:0%
I that I would make and I direct back to
 
04:44:54.708 --> 04:44:54.718 align:start position:0%
the to the comments of uh the ranking
 
04:44:56.750 --> 04:44:56.760 align:start position:0%
member I
 
04:44:59.750 --> 04:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
I would agree with the ranking members
 
04:45:02.090 --> 04:45:02.100 align:start position:0%
analysis when she gave the example of
 
04:45:06.110 --> 04:45:06.120 align:start position:0%
the of the of the uh driver who reaches
 
04:45:07.788 --> 04:45:07.798 align:start position:0%
down to pick up the coffee and is you
 
04:45:09.590 --> 04:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
know and it can be Char if it turns out
 
04:45:11.750 --> 04:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
that they're that constitutes criminal
 
04:45:15.350 --> 04:45:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:18.890 --> 04:45:18.900 align:start position:0%
that that analysis would apply
 
04:45:23.030 --> 04:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
if uh uh but uh if unlike what
 
04:45:24.948 --> 04:45:24.958 align:start position:0%
representative cutoff correctly pointed
 
04:45:24.958 --> 04:45:25.670 align:start position:0%
representative cutoff correctly pointed
out

04:45:25.670 --> 04:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
out
 
04:45:29.390 --> 04:45:29.400 align:start position:0%
there there was a general statute that
 
04:45:29.400 --> 04:45:30.490 align:start position:0%
there there was a general statute that
applied

04:45:30.490 --> 04:45:30.500 align:start position:0%
applied
 
04:45:34.610 --> 04:45:34.620 align:start position:0%
to and would make it murder or some
 
04:45:38.448 --> 04:45:38.458 align:start position:0%
other kind of homicide to uh terminate a
 
04:45:38.458 --> 04:45:39.350 align:start position:0%
other kind of homicide to uh terminate a
fetus

04:45:39.350 --> 04:45:39.360 align:start position:0%
fetus
 
04:45:41.810 --> 04:45:41.820 align:start position:0%
but in fact there isn't in fact the fact
 
04:45:43.670 --> 04:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
that there is a statute that makes it
 
04:45:47.270 --> 04:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
murder if if a child is born alive is
 
04:45:48.890 --> 04:45:48.900 align:start position:0%
the reason that later on when we get to
 
04:45:50.570 --> 04:45:50.580 align:start position:0%
it I am I frankly I'm going to vote
 
04:45:52.850 --> 04:45:52.860 align:start position:0%
against the born alive bill for that
 
04:45:54.410 --> 04:45:54.420 align:start position:0%
very reason because it's not necessary
 
04:45:57.708 --> 04:45:57.718 align:start position:0%
because if a fetus is if a child is now
 
04:46:01.250 --> 04:46:01.260 align:start position:0%
born and the doctor acts uh doctor
 
04:46:02.990 --> 04:46:03.000 align:start position:0%
effectively commits murder there's
 
04:46:04.730 --> 04:46:04.740 align:start position:0%
already a penalty for that and in my
 
04:46:06.650 --> 04:46:06.660 align:start position:0%
view there's no there is therefore no
 
04:46:09.770 --> 04:46:09.780 align:start position:0%
reason for the born alive bill this is a
 
04:46:12.708 --> 04:46:12.718 align:start position:0%
different situation when we uh when
 
04:46:15.590 --> 04:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
you're talking about an abortion
 
04:46:18.830 --> 04:46:18.840 align:start position:0%
um before the a child has been born so
 
04:46:20.990 --> 04:46:21.000 align:start position:0%
um those those are my reasons for
 
04:46:23.930 --> 04:46:23.940 align:start position:0%
supporting the itl and not wanting to
 
04:46:27.110 --> 04:46:27.120 align:start position:0%
repeal the penalties anyone else uh wish
 
04:46:28.010 --> 04:46:28.020 align:start position:0%
to speak
 
04:46:31.490 --> 04:46:31.500 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
04:46:34.010 --> 04:46:34.020 align:start position:0%
um so by criminalizing doctors for doing
 
04:46:37.070 --> 04:46:37.080 align:start position:0%
their job and working with the patients
 
04:46:39.530 --> 04:46:39.540 align:start position:0%
to get the care they need by threatening
 
04:46:41.690 --> 04:46:41.700 align:start position:0%
providers with a felony and imprisonment
 
04:46:44.628 --> 04:46:44.638 align:start position:0%
the law as it stands is an invitation
 
04:46:48.070 --> 04:46:48.080 align:start position:0%
for intimidation and harassment
 
04:46:52.670 --> 04:46:52.680 align:start position:0%
by criminalizing providers it'll make it
 
04:46:55.128 --> 04:46:55.138 align:start position:0%
very difficult for providers to come to
 
04:46:57.250 --> 04:46:57.260 align:start position:0%
our state to give good care
 
04:47:00.350 --> 04:47:00.360 align:start position:0%
and that is what's really important we
 
04:47:02.750 --> 04:47:02.760 align:start position:0%
need providers we're down providers out
 
04:47:05.750 --> 04:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
there and we need providers so we can't
 
04:47:09.650 --> 04:47:09.660 align:start position:0%
hold people we'll say to criminalize
 
04:47:12.650 --> 04:47:12.660 align:start position:0%
doctors they are in a different
 
04:47:15.288 --> 04:47:15.298 align:start position:0%
um category and we do need to think
 
04:47:17.390 --> 04:47:17.400 align:start position:0%
about that when we make our vote and I
 
04:47:19.850 --> 04:47:19.860 align:start position:0%
am definitely against itl
 
04:47:22.730 --> 04:47:22.740 align:start position:0%
are there anyone else wish to speak
 
04:47:25.190 --> 04:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
right I guess we're ready for uh ready
 
04:47:27.288 --> 04:47:27.298 align:start position:0%
for the roll call and the motion before
 
04:47:29.868 --> 04:47:29.878 align:start position:0%

we generally know
 
04:48:37.310 --> 04:48:37.320 align:start position:0%
I think we've seen begun to see a
 
04:48:40.070 --> 04:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
pattern in these votes
 
04:48:41.990 --> 04:48:42.000 align:start position:0%

04:48:55.610 --> 04:48:55.620 align:start position:0%
representative Macbeth seconds instead
 
04:49:00.110 --> 04:49:00.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:02.030 --> 04:49:02.040 align:start position:0%
yeah can
 
04:49:04.128 --> 04:49:04.138 align:start position:0%
and we
 
04:49:09.190 --> 04:49:09.200 align:start position:0%
do retain before we've before an OTP
 
04:49:11.470 --> 04:49:11.480 align:start position:0%
even almost
 
04:49:13.970 --> 04:49:13.980 align:start position:0%
we can do a retain as the first motion
 
04:49:17.208 --> 04:49:17.218 align:start position:0%
good okay all right okay go ahead
 
04:49:19.610 --> 04:49:19.620 align:start position:0%
um uh before I continue I do want to say
 
04:49:21.530 --> 04:49:21.540 align:start position:0%
that sitting in the audience are two of
 
04:49:23.270 --> 04:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
our distinguished former members of this
 
04:49:25.190 --> 04:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
committee who have come to see uh
 
04:49:26.868 --> 04:49:26.878 align:start position:0%
representative we have three in the
 
04:49:29.150 --> 04:49:29.160 align:start position:0%
audience oh oh and there I'm sorry three
 
04:49:31.550 --> 04:49:31.560 align:start position:0%
that's right and I want to say that
 
04:49:33.590 --> 04:49:33.600 align:start position:0%
they've come to see that we're carrying
 
04:49:33.600 --> 04:49:34.970 align:start position:0%
they've come to see that we're carrying
on

04:49:34.970 --> 04:49:34.980 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:49:36.830 --> 04:49:36.840 align:start position:0%
um a good tradition
 
04:49:41.628 --> 04:49:41.638 align:start position:0%
um I am I am I see a pattern and some of
 
04:49:43.670 --> 04:49:43.680 align:start position:0%
you might also see the same pattern in
 
04:49:44.990 --> 04:49:45.000 align:start position:0%
these votes
 
04:49:47.990 --> 04:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
and I see that pattern because these are
 
04:49:51.050 --> 04:49:51.060 align:start position:0%
really very difficult questions and
 
04:49:55.128 --> 04:49:55.138 align:start position:0%
those of us who who feel strongly one
 
04:49:56.830 --> 04:49:56.840 align:start position:0%
way or the other
 
04:50:00.890 --> 04:50:00.900 align:start position:0%
most of us also see
 
04:50:04.730 --> 04:50:04.740 align:start position:0%
that some of the arguments that are made
 
04:50:07.128 --> 04:50:07.138 align:start position:0%
the positions taken by people who share
 
04:50:10.190 --> 04:50:10.200 align:start position:0%
a different perspective are worthy of
 
04:50:13.368 --> 04:50:13.378 align:start position:0%
thought they shouldn't just be dismissed
 
04:50:16.430 --> 04:50:16.440 align:start position:0%
maybe at the end they should be I think
 
04:50:18.830 --> 04:50:18.840 align:start position:0%
that over the next few months
 
04:50:20.930 --> 04:50:20.940 align:start position:0%
we are very likely
 
04:50:24.850 --> 04:50:24.860 align:start position:0%
to see in this state and in this country
 
04:50:29.030 --> 04:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
new developments in this area having to
 
04:50:31.070 --> 04:50:31.080 align:start position:0%
do with Reproductive Rights
 
04:50:35.810 --> 04:50:35.820 align:start position:0%
and by retaining the bill now
 
04:50:35.820 --> 04:50:36.890 align:start position:0%
and by retaining the bill now
um

04:50:36.890 --> 04:50:36.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:50:40.970 --> 04:50:40.980 align:start position:0%
it stays in our control and this is the
 
04:50:43.070 --> 04:50:43.080 align:start position:0%
committee that could best make these
 
04:50:46.550 --> 04:50:46.560 align:start position:0%
decisions and come the fall we might
 
04:50:50.208 --> 04:50:50.218 align:start position:0%
find that any one of us
 
04:50:52.788 --> 04:50:52.798 align:start position:0%
could suggest or all of us could suggest
 
04:50:54.948 --> 04:50:54.958 align:start position:0%
something that does need
 
04:50:59.810 --> 04:50:59.820 align:start position:0%
to be fine-tuned in in how the state
 
04:51:03.350 --> 04:51:03.360 align:start position:0%
looks to its Reproductive Rights and by
 
04:51:06.190 --> 04:51:06.200 align:start position:0%
retaining it we keep that option open
 
04:51:09.230 --> 04:51:09.240 align:start position:0%
understanding that when the time comes
 
04:51:13.368 --> 04:51:13.378 align:start position:0%
we can itl the bill and nothing happens
 
04:51:15.530 --> 04:51:15.540 align:start position:0%
or we might use it in a vehicle that
 
04:51:18.708 --> 04:51:18.718 align:start position:0%
might be helpful to any of us so my
 
04:51:22.430 --> 04:51:22.440 align:start position:0%
suggestion is that we vote now to retain
 
04:51:24.830 --> 04:51:24.840 align:start position:0%
and that gives us the opportunity to
 
04:51:27.890 --> 04:51:27.900 align:start position:0%
move on to the next one thank you are
 
04:51:30.708 --> 04:51:30.718 align:start position:0%
there anyone else wish to speak to the
 
04:51:32.628 --> 04:51:32.638 align:start position:0%
motion retains yes representative
 
04:51:32.638 --> 04:51:34.550 align:start position:0%
motion retains yes representative
Staples

04:51:34.550 --> 04:51:34.560 align:start position:0%
Staples
 
04:51:36.590 --> 04:51:36.600 align:start position:0%
I would disagree
 
04:51:38.708 --> 04:51:38.718 align:start position:0%
with that analysis
 
04:51:41.330 --> 04:51:41.340 align:start position:0%
I would think that a retain might be
 
04:51:44.690 --> 04:51:44.700 align:start position:0%
more useful applicable on a full repeal
 
04:51:47.270 --> 04:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
of the fetal Life protection act rather
 
04:51:50.930 --> 04:51:50.940 align:start position:0%
than a penalty section repeal as in 224
 
04:51:50.940 --> 04:51:52.730 align:start position:0%
than a penalty section repeal as in 224
here

04:51:52.730 --> 04:51:52.740 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:51:52.740 --> 04:51:54.050 align:start position:0%
here
um

04:51:54.050 --> 04:51:54.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:51:57.590 --> 04:51:57.600 align:start position:0%
I think as I pointed out before that uh
 
04:52:00.070 --> 04:52:00.080 align:start position:0%
taking the penalty out is
 
04:52:03.288 --> 04:52:03.298 align:start position:0%
rendering it useless eviscerating the
 
04:52:05.208 --> 04:52:05.218 align:start position:0%
purpose of the law
 
04:52:07.868 --> 04:52:07.878 align:start position:0%
of the bucket with a hole in it again
 
04:52:10.490 --> 04:52:10.500 align:start position:0%
it's got a hole in it now and it's going
 
04:52:12.170 --> 04:52:12.180 align:start position:0%
to have a hole in it when it sits on the
 
04:52:14.930 --> 04:52:14.940 align:start position:0%
retainer shelf and so I would be opposed
 
04:52:18.410 --> 04:52:18.420 align:start position:0%
to retaining I think we should handle it
 
04:52:20.810 --> 04:52:20.820 align:start position:0%
up or down here
 
04:52:24.830 --> 04:52:24.840 align:start position:0%
anyone else wishes I have to offer an
 
04:52:30.050 --> 04:52:30.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:30.060 --> 04:52:31.490 align:start position:0%
 
I

04:52:31.490 --> 04:52:31.500 align:start position:0%
I
 
04:52:34.610 --> 04:52:34.620 align:start position:0%
was on the wrong bill
 
04:52:38.208 --> 04:52:38.218 align:start position:0%
and I can feel myself blushing so I know
 
04:52:39.948 --> 04:52:39.958 align:start position:0%
that I am
 
04:52:39.958 --> 04:52:41.750 align:start position:0%
that I am
and

04:52:41.750 --> 04:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:52:41.760 --> 04:52:44.270 align:start position:0%
and
um

04:52:44.270 --> 04:52:44.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:46.970 --> 04:52:46.980 align:start position:0%
and and what I would like to do is
 
04:52:50.690 --> 04:52:50.700 align:start position:0%
withdraw my motion and
 
04:52:53.750 --> 04:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
um hope that representative Macbeth who
 
04:52:55.670 --> 04:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
was kind enough to
 
04:52:55.680 --> 04:52:58.490 align:start position:0%
was kind enough to
second

04:52:58.490 --> 04:52:58.500 align:start position:0%
second
 
04:53:01.430 --> 04:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
the motion would also withdraw the
 
04:53:04.430 --> 04:53:04.440 align:start position:0%
second and I hope that you will all
 
04:53:08.208 --> 04:53:08.218 align:start position:0%
accept my apologies and I know I'm the
 
04:53:11.208 --> 04:53:11.218 align:start position:0%
only one who ever makes a mistake and so
 
04:53:13.810 --> 04:53:13.820 align:start position:0%
you should be kind to me
 
04:53:17.330 --> 04:53:17.340 align:start position:0%
there's no apologies necessary as you we
 
04:53:19.610 --> 04:53:19.620 align:start position:0%
we all make mistakes Mr chair time so I
 
04:53:22.310 --> 04:53:22.320 align:start position:0%
would just ask do you have since you've
 
04:53:24.410 --> 04:53:24.420 align:start position:0%
withdrawn that motion and the second has
 
04:53:25.550 --> 04:53:25.560 align:start position:0%
been withdrawn is that correct
 
04:53:27.050 --> 04:53:27.060 align:start position:0%
representative Macbeth
 
04:53:30.350 --> 04:53:30.360 align:start position:0%
so so do you have another emotion yes
 
04:53:32.810 --> 04:53:32.820 align:start position:0%
and I hope it doesn't surprise you it
 
04:53:34.670 --> 04:53:34.680 align:start position:0%
would be ought to pass is there a second
 
04:53:36.230 --> 04:53:36.240 align:start position:0%
for that
 
04:53:38.390 --> 04:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
representative Manos seconds all right
 
04:53:42.470 --> 04:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:45.948 --> 04:53:45.958 align:start position:0%
I move that we apply all of
 
04:53:48.890 --> 04:53:48.900 align:start position:0%
Representative Smith's arguments to any
 
04:53:51.350 --> 04:53:51.360 align:start position:0%
future bill that she would like to apply
 
04:53:53.570 --> 04:53:53.580 align:start position:0%
it to so that she doesn't have to say it
 
04:53:56.208 --> 04:53:56.218 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:59.030 --> 04:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander I would be very
 
04:54:02.230 --> 04:54:02.240 align:start position:0%
pleased to do that as long as oh
 
04:54:04.310 --> 04:54:04.320 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander pulled my
 
04:54:04.320 --> 04:54:07.430 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander pulled my
string

04:54:07.430 --> 04:54:07.440 align:start position:0%

probably the wrong since we're on the
 
04:55:39.110 --> 04:55:39.120 align:start position:0%
subject of abortion related bills I
 
04:55:41.208 --> 04:55:41.218 align:start position:0%
would propose to skip over 261 for the
 
04:55:44.750 --> 04:55:44.760 align:start position:0%
moment and go to 2 271
 
04:55:46.490 --> 04:55:46.500 align:start position:0%
and I would recognize representative
 
04:55:50.330 --> 04:55:50.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:55.250 --> 04:55:55.260 align:start position:0%

um I think we've already covered uh a
 
04:56:06.590 --> 04:56:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:07.850 --> 04:56:07.860 align:start position:0%
yeah I think we've already covered it
 
04:56:09.470 --> 04:56:09.480 align:start position:0%
I'll pass all right anyone else
 
04:56:11.570 --> 04:56:11.580 align:start position:0%

04:56:27.230 --> 04:56:27.240 align:start position:0%
at my young age
 
04:56:27.240 --> 04:56:28.070 align:start position:0%
at my young age
um

04:56:28.070 --> 04:56:28.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:56:30.350 --> 04:56:30.360 align:start position:0%
I haven't experienced quite as much but
 
04:56:32.208 --> 04:56:32.218 align:start position:0%
what I do remember
 
04:56:33.890 --> 04:56:33.900 align:start position:0%
very very
 
04:56:37.310 --> 04:56:37.320 align:start position:0%
well is last year when the entire house
 
04:56:41.390 --> 04:56:41.400 align:start position:0%
in a unanimous bipartisan way voted for
 
04:56:43.788 --> 04:56:43.798 align:start position:0%
the fetal Life protection act as it
 
04:56:45.830 --> 04:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
currently is right now
 
04:56:49.430 --> 04:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
so now we're here in the fall again
 
04:56:51.590 --> 04:56:51.600 align:start position:0%
and in this fetal Life protection act is
 
04:56:53.810 --> 04:56:53.820 align:start position:0%
one of the mo it stops some of the most
 
04:56:55.670 --> 04:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
extreme and unnecessary abortions that
 
04:56:55.680 --> 04:56:56.628 align:start position:0%
extreme and unnecessary abortions that
happen

04:56:56.628 --> 04:56:56.638 align:start position:0%
happen
 
04:56:59.090 --> 04:56:59.100 align:start position:0%
so in the unanimous and bipartisan
 
04:57:02.090 --> 04:57:02.100 align:start position:0%
fashion we all voted to keep it in place
 
04:57:04.610 --> 04:57:04.620 align:start position:0%
um so I believe this position fits the
 
04:57:06.470 --> 04:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
majority of granite Staters it was a
 
04:57:08.448 --> 04:57:08.458 align:start position:0%
hard-fought victory for 24 weeks I think
 
04:57:10.128 --> 04:57:10.138 align:start position:0%
it's completely reasonable
 
04:57:12.708 --> 04:57:12.718 align:start position:0%
um the complete repeal is unnecessary
 
04:57:15.708 --> 04:57:15.718 align:start position:0%
and my hope is that the middle the
 
04:57:17.570 --> 04:57:17.580 align:start position:0%
middle the the unanimous of the
 
04:57:19.310 --> 04:57:19.320 align:start position:0%
committee will vote
 
04:57:20.990 --> 04:57:21.000 align:start position:0%
um continue to hold the line in the
 
04:57:22.490 --> 04:57:22.500 align:start position:0%
middle so thank you
 
04:57:26.030 --> 04:57:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:29.410 --> 04:57:29.420 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair
 
04:57:33.948 --> 04:57:33.958 align:start position:0%
I am I feel great fondness
 
04:57:37.550 --> 04:57:37.560 align:start position:0%
for the youngest member of the committee
 
04:57:40.730 --> 04:57:40.740 align:start position:0%
who's present and I in fact think he is
 
04:57:43.788 --> 04:57:43.798 align:start position:0%
wise Beyond his years
 
04:57:48.250 --> 04:57:48.260 align:start position:0%
I also think that he is a very skilled
 
04:57:51.890 --> 04:57:51.900 align:start position:0%
politician and that is something that I
 
04:57:55.310 --> 04:57:55.320 align:start position:0%
am not I'm good on policy I'm good on
 
04:57:59.090 --> 04:57:59.100 align:start position:0%
procedure but I am not good on politics
 
04:58:05.448 --> 04:58:05.458 align:start position:0%
and I I make that clear I think that the
 
04:58:08.868 --> 04:58:08.878 align:start position:0%
representative from Goffstown knows
 
04:58:11.930 --> 04:58:11.940 align:start position:0%
that he might have been a little
 
04:58:11.940 --> 04:58:13.730 align:start position:0%
that he might have been a little
disingenuous

04:58:13.730 --> 04:58:13.740 align:start position:0%
disingenuous
 
04:58:16.910 --> 04:58:16.920 align:start position:0%
in not pointing out that
 
04:58:20.030 --> 04:58:20.040 align:start position:0%
highly inappropriately the fetal
 
04:58:24.770 --> 04:58:24.780 align:start position:0%
protection act was inserted into house
 
04:58:28.490 --> 04:58:28.500 align:start position:0%
bill to the trailer bill which is
 
04:58:31.390 --> 04:58:31.400 align:start position:0%
supposed to include language only
 
04:58:35.690 --> 04:58:35.700 align:start position:0%
related to expenditures in house bill
 
04:58:39.050 --> 04:58:39.060 align:start position:0%
one there had never been a policy
 
04:58:41.628 --> 04:58:41.638 align:start position:0%
Committee hearing there had never been a
 
04:58:46.368 --> 04:58:46.378 align:start position:0%
policy committee vote it was dropped in
 
04:58:49.490 --> 04:58:49.500 align:start position:0%
and the governor the distinguished
 
04:58:51.650 --> 04:58:51.660 align:start position:0%
governor who I believe is going to fill
 
04:58:54.288 --> 04:58:54.298 align:start position:0%
out his full term here before he goes on
 
04:58:55.910 --> 04:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
to the White House
 
04:58:58.610 --> 04:58:58.620 align:start position:0%
um the said publicly
 
04:59:01.310 --> 04:59:01.320 align:start position:0%
that he really didn't like
 
04:59:04.788 --> 04:59:04.798 align:start position:0%
this but and he is pro-choice he
 
04:59:09.770 --> 04:59:09.780 align:start position:0%
reassures us but he had to vote for for
 
04:59:12.590 --> 04:59:12.600 align:start position:0%
it because otherwise the budget wouldn't
 
04:59:12.600 --> 04:59:13.730 align:start position:0%
it because otherwise the budget wouldn't
pass

04:59:13.730 --> 04:59:13.740 align:start position:0%
pass
 
04:59:15.590 --> 04:59:15.600 align:start position:0%
the governor forgetting that two years
 
04:59:17.810 --> 04:59:17.820 align:start position:0%
before he had vetoed a budget and then
 
04:59:20.270 --> 04:59:20.280 align:start position:0%
was able to get more in it that he
 
04:59:22.930 --> 04:59:22.940 align:start position:0%
wanted so that to say that
 
04:59:26.990 --> 04:59:27.000 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly the house supported this
 
04:59:30.850 --> 04:59:30.860 align:start position:0%
language not recognizing that it was
 
04:59:34.550 --> 04:59:34.560 align:start position:0%
hidden in the middle of the of the state
 
04:59:37.670 --> 04:59:37.680 align:start position:0%
budget is perhaps not telling the full
 
04:59:37.680 --> 04:59:38.830 align:start position:0%
budget is perhaps not telling the full
story

04:59:38.830 --> 04:59:38.840 align:start position:0%
story
 
04:59:43.090 --> 04:59:43.100 align:start position:0%
and my objection to this has always been
 
04:59:46.070 --> 04:59:46.080 align:start position:0%
the policy
 
04:59:49.368 --> 04:59:49.378 align:start position:0%
um and and the procedure and the
 
04:59:52.910 --> 04:59:52.920 align:start position:0%
traditions of this house uh that
 
04:59:55.730 --> 04:59:55.740 align:start position:0%
in theory does not permit extraneous
 
04:59:57.590 --> 04:59:57.600 align:start position:0%
manners like this to be dropped in
 
04:59:59.570 --> 04:59:59.580 align:start position:0%
household two unless there had been a
 
05:00:02.868 --> 05:00:02.878 align:start position:0%
policy Committee hearing so I hope that
 
05:00:05.050 --> 05:00:05.060 align:start position:0%
in that context
 
05:00:08.390 --> 05:00:08.400 align:start position:0%
our youngest and Brilliant member would
 
05:00:11.208 --> 05:00:11.218 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that the vote on the floor
 
05:00:13.850 --> 05:00:13.860 align:start position:0%
was on the budget not particularly on
 
05:00:13.860 --> 05:00:14.690 align:start position:0%
was on the budget not particularly on
the

05:00:14.690 --> 05:00:14.700 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:00:14.700 --> 05:00:15.730 align:start position:0%
the
um

05:00:15.730 --> 05:00:15.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:00:20.150 --> 05:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
uh on the fetal Life protection act and
 
05:00:21.230 --> 05:00:21.240 align:start position:0%
I would
 
05:00:25.368 --> 05:00:25.378 align:start position:0%
hope that you would not support the itl
 
05:00:28.010 --> 05:00:28.020 align:start position:0%
thank you anyone else wish to up uh
 
05:00:28.020 --> 05:00:31.010 align:start position:0%
thank you anyone else wish to up uh
representative

05:00:31.010 --> 05:00:31.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:33.470 --> 05:00:33.480 align:start position:0%
so as we heard during the Committee
 
05:00:35.448 --> 05:00:35.458 align:start position:0%
hearing there actually was a bill that
 
05:00:38.150 --> 05:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
did go through the full process it was
 
05:00:43.368 --> 05:00:43.378 align:start position:0%
house house bill 625 in 2021 and yes it
 
05:00:44.690 --> 05:00:44.700 align:start position:0%
was then
 
05:00:46.910 --> 05:00:46.920 align:start position:0%
later put into the budget but it
 
05:00:48.708 --> 05:00:48.718 align:start position:0%
actually did get past the house and then
 
05:00:50.270 --> 05:00:50.280 align:start position:0%
was laid on the table in the Senate
 
05:00:52.190 --> 05:00:52.200 align:start position:0%
because it was added into the budget so
 
05:00:54.890 --> 05:00:54.900 align:start position:0%
I just did want to clarify that it it it
 
05:00:57.110 --> 05:00:57.120 align:start position:0%
did this
 
05:01:01.550 --> 05:01:01.560 align:start position:0%
topic did have a full hearing thank you
 
05:01:05.628 --> 05:01:05.638 align:start position:0%
other anyone else wish to speak I'm
 
05:01:06.890 --> 05:01:06.900 align:start position:0%
sorry representative Alexander James
 
05:01:09.650 --> 05:01:09.660 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr chair just to uh help
 
05:01:11.330 --> 05:01:11.340 align:start position:0%
clarify uh my friend representative
 
05:01:14.690 --> 05:01:14.700 align:start position:0%
Smith who is um just as brilliant as me
 
05:01:17.330 --> 05:01:17.340 align:start position:0%
um I would like to point out that last
 
05:01:19.788 --> 05:01:19.798 align:start position:0%
year in 2022 we had a bill that came
 
05:01:21.830 --> 05:01:21.840 align:start position:0%
through Judiciary that had to deal with
 
05:01:24.410 --> 05:01:24.420 align:start position:0%
an ultrasound requirement and
 
05:01:27.170 --> 05:01:27.180 align:start position:0%
um clarifying some language in that and
 
05:01:28.788 --> 05:01:28.798 align:start position:0%
then that bill ended up passing the
 
05:01:30.650 --> 05:01:30.660 align:start position:0%
house but that had the entire fetal Life
 
05:01:32.510 --> 05:01:32.520 align:start position:0%
protection act and that bill was
 
05:01:35.030 --> 05:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
supported by unanimous uh unanimously in
 
05:01:37.490 --> 05:01:37.500 align:start position:0%
the house so this has been supported
 
05:01:40.670 --> 05:01:40.680 align:start position:0%
before by in a bipartisan way
 
05:01:43.970 --> 05:01:43.980 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to speak to uh the
 
05:01:47.990 --> 05:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
motion of itl on House Bill 271.
 
05:01:50.510 --> 05:01:50.520 align:start position:0%

05:01:50.520 --> 05:01:52.490 align:start position:0%

yes
 
05:02:40.430 --> 05:02:40.440 align:start position:0%
um I would like to make a motion let me
 
05:02:43.070 --> 05:02:43.080 align:start position:0%
take a deep breath on this to retain
 
05:02:45.070 --> 05:02:45.080 align:start position:0%
this spill
 
05:02:45.080 --> 05:02:46.610 align:start position:0%
this spill
and

05:02:46.610 --> 05:02:46.620 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:02:50.448 --> 05:02:50.458 align:start position:0%
um I would refer to a
 
05:02:53.208 --> 05:02:53.218 align:start position:0%
to I would prefer to a comment that
 
05:02:55.550 --> 05:02:55.560 align:start position:0%
representative Stapleton made earlier
 
05:02:58.190 --> 05:02:58.200 align:start position:0%
that I thought made some sense and I
 
05:03:01.190 --> 05:03:01.200 align:start position:0%
would respect representative Grayson's
 
05:03:03.770 --> 05:03:03.780 align:start position:0%
View and therefore don't feel the need
 
05:03:06.650 --> 05:03:06.660 align:start position:0%
to say anything else at all except that
 
05:03:08.690 --> 05:03:08.700 align:start position:0%
I hope that you would agree to retain
 
05:03:11.750 --> 05:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
this bill so that we could
 
05:03:11.760 --> 05:03:13.490 align:start position:0%
this bill so that we could
um

05:03:13.490 --> 05:03:13.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:03:15.830 --> 05:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
keep open in this committee the
 
05:03:19.190 --> 05:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
possibility of us taking any additional
 
05:03:23.750 --> 05:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
action in this area if events determine
 
05:03:25.390 --> 05:03:25.400 align:start position:0%
that that would be appropriate thank you
 
05:03:27.288 --> 05:03:27.298 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to speak yes
 
05:03:28.788 --> 05:03:28.798 align:start position:0%
representative Staples
 
05:03:32.448 --> 05:03:32.458 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair while I did say that
 
05:03:36.470 --> 05:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
my opinion the better Bill to retain
 
05:03:40.910 --> 05:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
under circumstances would be the 224
 
05:03:44.208 --> 05:03:44.218 align:start position:0%
that was not to imply that I granted
 
05:03:46.970 --> 05:03:46.980 align:start position:0%
approval to such a retained so I would
 
05:03:49.310 --> 05:03:49.320 align:start position:0%
be opposed to that
 
05:03:52.730 --> 05:03:52.740 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to speak I guess one of
 
05:03:54.288 --> 05:03:54.298 align:start position:0%
the things that I would and I very much
 
05:03:57.830 --> 05:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
appreciate representative Smith's view
 
05:04:00.230 --> 05:04:00.240 align:start position:0%
on this I respect her greatly
 
05:04:04.550 --> 05:04:04.560 align:start position:0%
I I guess I I disagree with her for this
 
05:04:04.560 --> 05:04:05.628 align:start position:0%
I I guess I I disagree with her for this
reason

05:04:05.628 --> 05:04:05.638 align:start position:0%
reason
 
05:04:08.090 --> 05:04:08.100 align:start position:0%
I don't think that much is likely to
 
05:04:11.570 --> 05:04:11.580 align:start position:0%
change between now and the fall
 
05:04:14.690 --> 05:04:14.700 align:start position:0%
um I I think if it's much more likely if
 
05:04:16.250 --> 05:04:16.260 align:start position:0%
things were to change it would be more
 
05:04:18.530 --> 05:04:18.540 align:start position:0%
in the you know two years from after the
 
05:04:21.590 --> 05:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
next election or beyond that
 
05:04:23.750 --> 05:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
more importantly I'm
 
05:04:23.760 --> 05:04:24.830 align:start position:0%
more importantly I'm
I

05:04:24.830 --> 05:04:24.840 align:start position:0%
I
 
05:04:26.810 --> 05:04:26.820 align:start position:0%
I had the opportunity to write an op-ed
 
05:04:29.390 --> 05:04:29.400 align:start position:0%
piece several months ago about what was
 
05:04:31.310 --> 05:04:31.320 align:start position:0%
going to happen after Roe v Wade and one
 
05:04:32.690 --> 05:04:32.700 align:start position:0%
of the things I said there that I still
 
05:04:35.330 --> 05:04:35.340 align:start position:0%
very much believe is
 
05:04:38.030 --> 05:04:38.040 align:start position:0%
five years from now
 
05:04:40.190 --> 05:04:40.200 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe it'll take a little bit
 
05:04:43.010 --> 05:04:43.020 align:start position:0%
longer all of this stuff on both sides
 
05:04:44.930 --> 05:04:44.940 align:start position:0%
is going to go away people are going to
 
05:04:47.330 --> 05:04:47.340 align:start position:0%
be are going to come to the realization
 
05:04:50.570 --> 05:04:50.580 align:start position:0%
that most people like the law about
 
05:04:52.850 --> 05:04:52.860 align:start position:0%
where it is right now will they Tinker
 
05:04:54.890 --> 05:04:54.900 align:start position:0%
with it a little bit should it be 22
 
05:04:57.830 --> 05:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
weeks 20 on the one hand or 26 on the
 
05:05:00.590 --> 05:05:00.600 align:start position:0%
other maybe you'll yeah maybe but
 
05:05:03.050 --> 05:05:03.060 align:start position:0%
basically people are P it's going to
 
05:05:04.610 --> 05:05:04.620 align:start position:0%
turn out that people are going to
 
05:05:07.610 --> 05:05:07.620 align:start position:0%
realize that the politics on both sides
 
05:05:09.590 --> 05:05:09.600 align:start position:0%
of this is going to settle out
 
05:05:11.390 --> 05:05:11.400 align:start position:0%
people are going to realize that the
 
05:05:13.010 --> 05:05:13.020 align:start position:0%
overwhelming majority of people do
 
05:05:15.410 --> 05:05:15.420 align:start position:0%
support abortion rights but they want
 
05:05:18.350 --> 05:05:18.360 align:start position:0%
limitations and that 24 weeks is about
 
05:05:20.990 --> 05:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
where it should be and all of this is
 
05:05:23.570 --> 05:05:23.580 align:start position:0%
kind of gonna go away and so I think
 
05:05:26.930 --> 05:05:26.940 align:start position:0%
that to to prolong this
 
05:05:29.390 --> 05:05:29.400 align:start position:0%
um is is not the best thing so I will be
 
05:05:32.150 --> 05:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
I will be voting against uh the motion
 
05:05:36.230 --> 05:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:39.650 --> 05:05:39.660 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to be hurt
 
05:05:40.850 --> 05:05:40.860 align:start position:0%
all right
 
05:05:42.470 --> 05:05:42.480 align:start position:0%

we'll representative oh I'm sorry do we
 
05:05:46.550 --> 05:05:46.560 align:start position:0%

do we have to uh can we just submit it
 
05:06:50.390 --> 05:06:50.400 align:start position:0%

05:06:56.330 --> 05:06:56.340 align:start position:0%
then if we if we submit it without
 
05:06:56.340 --> 05:06:58.070 align:start position:0%
then if we if we submit it without
recommendation

05:06:58.070 --> 05:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
05:07:00.470 --> 05:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
on on this state of the record there was
 
05:07:02.270 --> 05:07:02.280 align:start position:0%
somebody would write a report in favor
 
05:07:04.430 --> 05:07:04.440 align:start position:0%
of itl and somebody else would provide a
 
05:07:04.440 --> 05:07:05.390 align:start position:0%
of itl and somebody else would provide a
report

05:07:05.390 --> 05:07:05.400 align:start position:0%
report
 
05:07:07.090 --> 05:07:07.100 align:start position:0%
in favor of
 
05:07:07.100 --> 05:07:09.910 align:start position:0%
in favor of
retainers

05:07:09.910 --> 05:07:09.920 align:start position:0%
retainers
 
05:07:13.670 --> 05:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
all right so it would have to be someone
 
05:07:13.680 --> 05:07:17.270 align:start position:0%
all right so it would have to be someone
um

05:07:17.270 --> 05:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:19.490 --> 05:07:19.500 align:start position:0%
okay all right
 
05:07:22.430 --> 05:07:22.440 align:start position:0%
so we so is it I mean is there a should
 
05:07:25.010 --> 05:07:25.020 align:start position:0%
we have an O both of those have failed
 
05:07:27.110 --> 05:07:27.120 align:start position:0%
should we have an OTP motion I mean I
 
05:07:29.208 --> 05:07:29.218 align:start position:0%
don't I assume that would fail also but
 
05:07:31.910 --> 05:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
if somebody I mean do we need I guess
 
05:07:34.128 --> 05:07:34.138 align:start position:0%
what I'm really asking my my colleagues
 
05:07:37.670 --> 05:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
on the on the other side is
 
05:07:40.128 --> 05:07:40.138 align:start position:0%
do you in order to preserve your
 
05:07:42.350 --> 05:07:42.360 align:start position:0%
position of if you want to try to
 
05:07:45.590 --> 05:07:45.600 align:start position:0%
persuade the floor to vote OTP do you
 
05:07:47.510 --> 05:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
need to have a motion here to do that I
 
05:07:49.010 --> 05:07:49.020 align:start position:0%
don't know whether that what the answer
 
05:07:51.650 --> 05:07:51.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:54.350 --> 05:07:54.360 align:start position:0%
Scott Webster that I and I'm looking at
 
05:07:57.590 --> 05:07:57.600 align:start position:0%
Kurt I don't think so because if we had
 
05:08:01.788 --> 05:08:01.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:05.470 --> 05:08:05.480 align:start position:0%
that's the other side
 
05:08:07.550 --> 05:08:07.560 align:start position:0%
do you mean if it failed then somebody
 
05:08:08.990 --> 05:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
could say we want to make another motion
 
05:08:13.368 --> 05:08:13.378 align:start position:0%
of OTP no what I'm saying is if
 
05:08:15.470 --> 05:08:15.480 align:start position:0%
in in ordinary circumstances the
 
05:08:17.208 --> 05:08:17.218 align:start position:0%
committee voted itl
 
05:08:20.150 --> 05:08:20.160 align:start position:0%
period the end new paragraph
 
05:08:23.230 --> 05:08:23.240 align:start position:0%
the itl would be the committee position
 
05:08:27.050 --> 05:08:27.060 align:start position:0%
and then the minority
 
05:08:27.060 --> 05:08:28.430 align:start position:0%
and then the minority
could

05:08:28.430 --> 05:08:28.440 align:start position:0%
could
 
05:08:31.610 --> 05:08:31.620 align:start position:0%
say OTP even though that okay okay don't
 
05:08:33.230 --> 05:08:33.240 align:start position:0%
you're right I agree with you this is a
 
05:08:33.240 --> 05:08:38.868 align:start position:0%
you're right I agree with you this is a
little

05:08:38.868 --> 05:08:38.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:40.550 --> 05:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
dick that
 
05:08:45.288 --> 05:08:45.298 align:start position:0%
um if you don't want a big Full House to
 
05:08:49.070 --> 05:08:49.080 align:start position:0%
to die of indigestion
 
05:08:51.530 --> 05:08:51.540 align:start position:0%
um we could reconsider the retention and
 
05:08:54.170 --> 05:08:54.180 align:start position:0%
just one change we could retain the vote
 
05:08:56.030 --> 05:08:56.040 align:start position:0%
and have one less vote to deal with on
 
05:08:58.128 --> 05:08:58.138 align:start position:0%
the floor
 
05:09:00.530 --> 05:09:00.540 align:start position:0%
um Mr chair I don't know if you'd be
 
05:09:02.930 --> 05:09:02.940 align:start position:0%

05:11:38.628 --> 05:11:38.638 align:start position:0%
made and seconded uh representative you
 
05:11:43.368 --> 05:11:43.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:45.590 --> 05:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
so we heard a lot of testimony related
 
05:11:49.190 --> 05:11:49.200 align:start position:0%
to the fact that if
 
05:11:51.350 --> 05:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
families were delivering a baby that was
 
05:11:53.628 --> 05:11:53.638 align:start position:0%
born with a known fatal fetal anomaly
 
05:11:53.638 --> 05:11:55.250 align:start position:0%
born with a known fatal fetal anomaly
that

05:11:55.250 --> 05:11:55.260 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:11:57.470 --> 05:11:57.480 align:start position:0%
they want to spend the time holding
 
05:11:59.270 --> 05:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
their baby and their baby's only going
 
05:12:01.430 --> 05:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
to live likely for you know a few hours
 
05:12:02.990 --> 05:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
and they don't want their baby to be
 
05:12:05.050 --> 05:12:05.060 align:start position:0%
whisked away off to a NICU to be
 
05:12:08.150 --> 05:12:08.160 align:start position:0%
provided you know futile efforts such as
 
05:12:11.090 --> 05:12:11.100 align:start position:0%
you know ventilator those types of those
 
05:12:13.610 --> 05:12:13.620 align:start position:0%
types of things so it is my belief that
 
05:12:15.830 --> 05:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
this bill the way it's written
 
05:12:18.410 --> 05:12:18.420 align:start position:0%
has the potential to do harm to those
 
05:12:18.420 --> 05:12:20.208 align:start position:0%
has the potential to do harm to those
families

05:12:20.208 --> 05:12:20.218 align:start position:0%
families
 
05:12:22.550 --> 05:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
it is also my belief that where we
 
05:12:24.350 --> 05:12:24.360 align:start position:0%
currently have
 
05:12:26.810 --> 05:12:26.820 align:start position:0%
on the books the fetal Life protection
 
05:12:29.890 --> 05:12:29.900 align:start position:0%
act it is illegal to abort a baby
 
05:12:32.570 --> 05:12:32.580 align:start position:0%
post-viability so it wouldn't be
 
05:12:34.970 --> 05:12:34.980 align:start position:0%
possible for a baby to be delivered that
 
05:12:37.430 --> 05:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
way unless again it was in the the
 
05:12:40.670 --> 05:12:40.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:40.680 --> 05:12:41.810 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:12:41.810 --> 05:12:41.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:12:44.570 --> 05:12:44.580 align:start position:0%
violating that provision
 
05:12:44.580 --> 05:12:45.890 align:start position:0%
violating that provision
so

05:12:45.890 --> 05:12:45.900 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:12:48.050 --> 05:12:48.060 align:start position:0%
with that I think that the law is is
 
05:12:49.788 --> 05:12:49.798 align:start position:0%
unnecessary that there's already
 
05:12:53.690 --> 05:12:53.700 align:start position:0%
Protections in place for this and as
 
05:12:55.310 --> 05:12:55.320 align:start position:0%
written I think it has the potential to
 
05:12:57.830 --> 05:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
do to do more harm than good thank you
 
05:13:01.490 --> 05:13:01.500 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to speak to uh
 
05:13:05.330 --> 05:13:05.340 align:start position:0%
HB 346 the itl motion yes uh
 
05:13:07.670 --> 05:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn
 
05:13:11.270 --> 05:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
um so this bill I feel is not
 
05:13:13.730 --> 05:13:13.740 align:start position:0%
um an abortion bill it's actually a bill
 
05:13:16.610 --> 05:13:16.620 align:start position:0%
that is for
 
05:13:19.610 --> 05:13:19.620 align:start position:0%
people that go into early labor or they
 
05:13:24.110 --> 05:13:24.120 align:start position:0%
have fetal fatal anomalies which
 
05:13:26.270 --> 05:13:26.280 align:start position:0%
um we'll say you say does happen to
 
05:13:28.550 --> 05:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
people and that
 
05:13:28.560 --> 05:13:30.050 align:start position:0%
people and that
um and

05:13:30.050 --> 05:13:30.060 align:start position:0%
um and
 
05:13:32.990 --> 05:13:33.000 align:start position:0%
when we heard testimony in the past one
 
05:13:35.208 --> 05:13:35.218 align:start position:0%
thing I'd just like to bring up is I've
 
05:13:38.448 --> 05:13:38.458 align:start position:0%
never seen anybody walk away from a a
 
05:13:41.410 --> 05:13:41.420 align:start position:0%
baby who is passing away
 
05:13:44.150 --> 05:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
everybody makes their best effort to
 
05:13:47.650 --> 05:13:47.660 align:start position:0%
take care of both the mom and the baby
 
05:13:54.110 --> 05:13:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:59.090 --> 05:13:59.100 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to speak to HB 346 to
 
05:14:02.690 --> 05:14:02.700 align:start position:0%

let me the next 62 turn to 562. Yes
 
05:15:41.700 --> 05:15:42.490 align:start position:0%

05:15:42.490 --> 05:15:42.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:15:45.530 --> 05:15:45.540 align:start position:0%
uh and I would recognize uh
 
05:15:50.810 --> 05:15:50.820 align:start position:0%

05:16:01.128 --> 05:16:01.138 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
05:16:03.590 --> 05:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
I'll second all right motions be made
 
05:16:05.030 --> 05:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
and seconded representative Stapleton do
 
05:16:09.590 --> 05:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:13.550 --> 05:16:13.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:13.560 --> 05:16:14.868 align:start position:0%
 
most

05:16:14.868 --> 05:16:14.878 align:start position:0%
most
 
05:16:16.628 --> 05:16:16.638 align:start position:0%
if not all
 
05:16:20.030 --> 05:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
Physicians and medical people are bound
 
05:16:23.990 --> 05:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
by ethical standards and
 
05:16:25.570 --> 05:16:25.580 align:start position:0%
good practice
 
05:16:29.270 --> 05:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
to provide their patients with
 
05:16:32.270 --> 05:16:32.280 align:start position:0%
enough information for informed consent
 
05:16:35.390 --> 05:16:35.400 align:start position:0%
on any number of medical
 
05:16:39.170 --> 05:16:39.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:41.990 --> 05:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
um and I believe that um
 
05:16:45.650 --> 05:16:45.660 align:start position:0%
this this law may be difficult to
 
05:16:48.830 --> 05:16:48.840 align:start position:0%
administer and enforce
 
05:16:48.840 --> 05:16:49.610 align:start position:0%
administer and enforce
um

05:16:49.610 --> 05:16:49.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:16:52.490 --> 05:16:52.500 align:start position:0%
you have to dig pretty deep to determine
 
05:16:55.010 --> 05:16:55.020 align:start position:0%
that there was a failure in
 
05:16:57.948 --> 05:16:57.958 align:start position:0%
providing the proper if not adequate
 
05:16:59.990 --> 05:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
conformed consent
 
05:17:02.810 --> 05:17:02.820 align:start position:0%
so I think from a technical standpoint
 
05:17:06.110 --> 05:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
um the bill is itl properly all right
 
05:17:09.110 --> 05:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to speak to uh
 
05:17:13.788 --> 05:17:13.798 align:start position:0%
uh excuse me House Bill uh 562.
 
05:17:17.570 --> 05:17:17.580 align:start position:0%
yes representative Perez
 
05:17:20.448 --> 05:17:20.458 align:start position:0%
I am in favor of this bill and I had a
 
05:17:22.670 --> 05:17:22.680 align:start position:0%
long conversation with
 
05:17:25.550 --> 05:17:25.560 align:start position:0%
um the two people representing the um
 
05:17:28.850 --> 05:17:28.860 align:start position:0%
clinics that perform abortions which by
 
05:17:31.190 --> 05:17:31.200 align:start position:0%
the way they do not perform over 15
 
05:17:33.190 --> 05:17:33.200 align:start position:0%
weeks after our
 
05:17:37.910 --> 05:17:37.920 align:start position:0%
after we had testimony my concern is
 
05:17:37.920 --> 05:17:39.310 align:start position:0%
after we had testimony my concern is
that

05:17:39.310 --> 05:17:39.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:17:43.670 --> 05:17:43.680 align:start position:0%
very often people are not informed of
 
05:17:46.250 --> 05:17:46.260 align:start position:0%
their options until they walk in the
 
05:17:48.770 --> 05:17:48.780 align:start position:0%
door to have an abortion
 
05:17:53.390 --> 05:17:53.400 align:start position:0%
so the example that I want to give to
 
05:17:55.910 --> 05:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
you is that I am an 18 year old girl
 
05:17:58.850 --> 05:17:58.860 align:start position:0%
about to graduate from college
 
05:18:03.230 --> 05:18:03.240 align:start position:0%
and I find out I'm pregnant and I'm
 
05:18:05.330 --> 05:18:05.340 align:start position:0%
gonna go to college and I want to have
 
05:18:07.730 --> 05:18:07.740 align:start position:0%
an abortion I'm 18 so I can have it
 
05:18:10.788 --> 05:18:10.798 align:start position:0%
without parental consent I am a wreck
 
05:18:14.150 --> 05:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
about this I don't know what my options
 
05:18:18.230 --> 05:18:18.240 align:start position:0%
are I am uninformed about my options and
 
05:18:20.628 --> 05:18:20.638 align:start position:0%
I walk in to have an abortion
 
05:18:23.030 --> 05:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
and you are now going to tell me well
 
05:18:24.708 --> 05:18:24.718 align:start position:0%
you know you could have had give the
 
05:18:27.770 --> 05:18:27.780 align:start position:0%
baby up for adoption there are places
 
05:18:30.530 --> 05:18:30.540 align:start position:0%
that will help you
 
05:18:33.470 --> 05:18:33.480 align:start position:0%
through your pregnancy and with the
 
05:18:35.930 --> 05:18:35.940 align:start position:0%
delivery and help you with that
 
05:18:38.810 --> 05:18:38.820 align:start position:0%
am I in the right frame of mind at that
 
05:18:41.390 --> 05:18:41.400 align:start position:0%
point to get this information and it's
 
05:18:43.850 --> 05:18:43.860 align:start position:0%
not just the 18 year old it's anyone
 
05:18:46.850 --> 05:18:46.860 align:start position:0%
they're in an emotional state where are
 
05:18:49.868 --> 05:18:49.878 align:start position:0%
they ready to accept and become informed
 
05:18:52.730 --> 05:18:52.740 align:start position:0%
therefore I think it's just like we
 
05:18:55.850 --> 05:18:55.860 align:start position:0%
don't have people sign their consent in
 
05:18:59.208 --> 05:18:59.218 align:start position:0%
a hospital situation if they are have
 
05:19:02.628 --> 05:19:02.638 align:start position:0%
received any medication well you know
 
05:19:06.470 --> 05:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
emotion is a form of medication and I
 
05:19:09.110 --> 05:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
really believe that we didn't have
 
05:19:11.270 --> 05:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
anyone come really I don't believe and
 
05:19:13.850 --> 05:19:13.860 align:start position:0%
testify about the options that were
 
05:19:16.970 --> 05:19:16.980 align:start position:0%
available to people about that there are
 
05:19:20.570 --> 05:19:20.580 align:start position:0%
places what happened to giving babies up
 
05:19:24.708 --> 05:19:24.718 align:start position:0%
for adoption so therefore I think we
 
05:19:27.170 --> 05:19:27.180 align:start position:0%
need to inform people we need to make
 
05:19:30.110 --> 05:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
sure I asked when you call them back for
 
05:19:32.270 --> 05:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
their appointment do you tell them
 
05:19:34.128 --> 05:19:34.138 align:start position:0%
you know are you sure this is what you
 
05:19:36.230 --> 05:19:36.240 align:start position:0%
want there are other resources available
 
05:19:39.590 --> 05:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
for you well and are they provided by a
 
05:19:42.110 --> 05:19:42.120 align:start position:0%
medical person I worked as a school
 
05:19:44.750 --> 05:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
nurse for a very short time I had many
 
05:19:46.610 --> 05:19:46.620 align:start position:0%
young girls and this is before you had
 
05:19:49.670 --> 05:19:49.680 align:start position:0%
to be 18. you you had to notify your
 
05:19:52.270 --> 05:19:52.280 align:start position:0%
parents I had many young girls come in
 
05:19:55.610 --> 05:19:55.620 align:start position:0%
and you know they'd say I'd say well you
 
05:19:58.430 --> 05:19:58.440 align:start position:0%
have options and I purposely put those
 
05:20:01.128 --> 05:20:01.138 align:start position:0%
options in a bowl and had them choose
 
05:20:03.410 --> 05:20:03.420 align:start position:0%
them one by one because if I said well
 
05:20:04.910 --> 05:20:04.920 align:start position:0%
you can have an abortion they'd say oh
 
05:20:06.590 --> 05:20:06.600 align:start position:0%
well she wants she thinks I should have
 
05:20:07.850 --> 05:20:07.860 align:start position:0%
an abortion
 
05:20:10.730 --> 05:20:10.740 align:start position:0%
I just think the options need to be
 
05:20:13.010 --> 05:20:13.020 align:start position:0%
presented to people so that they can
 
05:20:16.368 --> 05:20:16.378 align:start position:0%
make an informed rational decision about
 
05:20:19.070 --> 05:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
the termination of a life prior to it
 
05:20:21.350 --> 05:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
happening thank you
 
05:20:23.270 --> 05:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry representative yes
 
05:20:24.770 --> 05:20:24.780 align:start position:0%
representative greeson
 
05:20:26.868 --> 05:20:26.878 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair during the testimony
 
05:20:28.128 --> 05:20:28.138 align:start position:0%
on this bill we were told that
 
05:20:29.810 --> 05:20:29.820 align:start position:0%
information regarding the reversal of
 
05:20:31.910 --> 05:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
chemical abortions was dangerous medical
 
05:20:34.610 --> 05:20:34.620 align:start position:0%
misinformation and that there is no body
 
05:20:36.110 --> 05:20:36.120 align:start position:0%
of evidence to indicate reversible
 
05:20:38.390 --> 05:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
reversal is possible
 
05:20:40.430 --> 05:20:40.440 align:start position:0%
so the question is who determines that
 
05:20:41.868 --> 05:20:41.878 align:start position:0%
something is medical misinformation
 
05:20:43.910 --> 05:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
because we've been treated to a
 
05:20:45.470 --> 05:20:45.480 align:start position:0%
smorgasbord of medical misinformation
 
05:20:47.090 --> 05:20:47.100 align:start position:0%
over the last couple of years and the
 
05:20:48.230 --> 05:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
federal government has been the Golden
 
05:20:50.448 --> 05:20:50.458 align:start position:0%
Corral of it I looked at planned
 
05:20:52.190 --> 05:20:52.200 align:start position:0%
parenthood's website to see what they
 
05:20:54.170 --> 05:20:54.180 align:start position:0%
say about reversal of chemical abortions
 
05:20:56.330 --> 05:20:56.340 align:start position:0%
and I cut and paste it here so this is
 
05:20:58.430 --> 05:20:58.440 align:start position:0%
what Planned Parenthood says quote
 
05:21:01.070 --> 05:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
here's the deal the abortion pill is the
 
05:21:02.750 --> 05:21:02.760 align:start position:0%
popular name for a safe and effective
 
05:21:05.270 --> 05:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
way to end an early pregnancy using a
 
05:21:07.128 --> 05:21:07.138 align:start position:0%
combination of two medicines but
 
05:21:09.230 --> 05:21:09.240 align:start position:0%
pepperstone and my soccer stall the
 
05:21:11.990 --> 05:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
first medicine is a pepperstone is given
 
05:21:14.090 --> 05:21:14.100 align:start position:0%
at a health care center or your health
 
05:21:16.190 --> 05:21:16.200 align:start position:0%
care provider's office after taking
 
05:21:17.628 --> 05:21:17.638 align:start position:0%
mepheprostone you take a second
 
05:21:20.868 --> 05:21:20.878 align:start position:0%
medication misoprostol at home 6 to 48
 
05:21:22.910 --> 05:21:22.920 align:start position:0%
hours later this causes cramping and
 
05:21:25.128 --> 05:21:25.138 align:start position:0%
bleeding and empties your uterus claims
 
05:21:26.390 --> 05:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
about treatments that reverse the
 
05:21:28.670 --> 05:21:28.680 align:start position:0%
effects of medication abortion are out
 
05:21:30.708 --> 05:21:30.718 align:start position:0%
there and a handful of States required
 
05:21:32.090 --> 05:21:32.100 align:start position:0%
doctors and nurses to tell their
 
05:21:33.830 --> 05:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
patients about them before they can
 
05:21:35.990 --> 05:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
provide abortion care but these claims
 
05:21:37.550 --> 05:21:37.560 align:start position:0%
haven't been proven in reliable medical
 
05:21:39.530 --> 05:21:39.540 align:start position:0%
studies nor have they been tested for
 
05:21:41.270 --> 05:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
safety Effectiveness or the likelihood
 
05:21:43.430 --> 05:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
of side effects so experts like the
 
05:21:44.930 --> 05:21:44.940 align:start position:0%
American College of Obstetricians and
 
05:21:46.730 --> 05:21:46.740 align:start position:0%
gynecologists reject these untested
 
05:21:46.740 --> 05:21:47.530 align:start position:0%
gynecologists reject these untested
supposed

05:21:47.530 --> 05:21:47.540 align:start position:0%
supposed
 
05:21:50.270 --> 05:21:50.280 align:start position:0%
treatments studies on the abortion pill
 
05:21:51.948 --> 05:21:51.958 align:start position:0%
do show that if you take the first
 
05:21:54.230 --> 05:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
medicine but not the second the abortion
 
05:21:56.208 --> 05:21:56.218 align:start position:0%
pill is less likely to work so if you've
 
05:21:57.948 --> 05:21:57.958 align:start position:0%
begun the process of having an abortion
 
05:21:59.868 --> 05:21:59.878 align:start position:0%
using the abortion pill but are having
 
05:22:01.850 --> 05:22:01.860 align:start position:0%
second thoughts contact the doctor or
 
05:22:04.190 --> 05:22:04.200 align:start position:0%
nurse you saw for the abortion right
 
05:22:06.230 --> 05:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
away to talk about your best next steps
 
05:22:08.208 --> 05:22:08.218 align:start position:0%
and what to expect close quote this
 
05:22:11.690 --> 05:22:11.700 align:start position:0%
information is dated September of 2017.
 
05:22:13.610 --> 05:22:13.620 align:start position:0%
as for there not being a body of
 
05:22:15.110 --> 05:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
evidence to indicate reversal is
 
05:22:17.390 --> 05:22:17.400 align:start position:0%
possible there actually is a body of
 
05:22:19.430 --> 05:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
evidence small though it is so we'll
 
05:22:22.090 --> 05:22:22.100 align:start position:0%
call it a fetus of evidence in 2018
 
05:22:24.288 --> 05:22:24.298 align:start position:0%
physician George Delgado had a
 
05:22:25.788 --> 05:22:25.798 align:start position:0%
peer-reviewed study published in the
 
05:22:27.830 --> 05:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
medical journal issues in law and
 
05:22:30.470 --> 05:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
Medicine where they studied 754 women
 
05:22:32.510 --> 05:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
who all wanted to stop their in-progress
 
05:22:35.150 --> 05:22:35.160 align:start position:0%
chemical abortions working with a an

Mary Davenport and five other Scholars

Delgado demonstrated that when
 
05:22:43.250 --> 05:22:43.260 align:start position:0%
administered within 72 hours of taking
 
05:22:46.010 --> 05:22:46.020 align:start position:0%
mepheprostone the protocol has a 64 to

68 success rate in Saving unborn babies
 
05:22:52.430 --> 05:22:52.440 align:start position:0%
notably the study also found zero
 
05:22:54.410 --> 05:22:54.420 align:start position:0%
increased risk of birth defects or
 
05:22:56.690 --> 05:22:56.700 align:start position:0%
pre-term births in fact the American

College of Obstetricians and
 
05:23:01.310 --> 05:23:01.320 align:start position:0%
gynecologists the same American College
 
05:23:03.470 --> 05:23:03.480 align:start position:0%
of Obstetricians gynecologist that
 
05:23:05.810 --> 05:23:05.820 align:start position:0%

shown to cause cause birth defects
 
05:23:15.530 --> 05:23:15.540 align:start position:0%
delgado's 2018 study was first publicly
 
05:23:17.570 --> 05:23:17.580 align:start position:0%
available documentation on the protocol
 
05:23:20.448 --> 05:23:20.458 align:start position:0%
since 2012 when he and Davenport
 
05:23:22.730 --> 05:23:22.740 align:start position:0%
published an article following seven
 
05:23:24.650 --> 05:23:24.660 align:start position:0%
women's progress in the annals of
 
05:23:24.660 --> 05:23:26.930 align:start position:0%
women's progress in the annals of
pharmacotherapy

05:23:26.930 --> 05:23:26.940 align:start position:0%
pharmacotherapy
 
05:23:29.270 --> 05:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
the problem is that the sample size was
 
05:23:31.128 --> 05:23:31.138 align:start position:0%
very small
 
05:23:33.650 --> 05:23:33.660 align:start position:0%
however it did show a tremendous success
 
05:23:36.708 --> 05:23:36.718 align:start position:0%
rate and it also is consistent with a
 
05:23:39.050 --> 05:23:39.060 align:start position:0%
European study that it showed similar
 
05:23:42.350 --> 05:23:42.360 align:start position:0%
results although it too was very small
 
05:23:44.690 --> 05:23:44.700 align:start position:0%
it should be noted that progesterone has
 
05:23:46.368 --> 05:23:46.378 align:start position:0%
been used in pregnancies for over 70
 
05:23:49.610 --> 05:23:49.620 align:start position:0%
years now safely and effectively so the
 
05:23:51.708 --> 05:23:51.718 align:start position:0%
American Association of pro-life
 
05:23:53.810 --> 05:23:53.820 align:start position:0%
Obstetricians and gynecologists support
 
05:23:56.330 --> 05:23:56.340 align:start position:0%
the procedure and in their public
 
05:23:58.730 --> 05:23:58.740 align:start position:0%
statement they make three important uh
 
05:24:01.070 --> 05:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
statements about the procedure one
 
05:24:03.230 --> 05:24:03.240 align:start position:0%
progesterone has been safely used during
 
05:24:05.448 --> 05:24:05.458 align:start position:0%
pregnancy for decades without undesired
 
05:24:05.458 --> 05:24:07.610 align:start position:0%
pregnancy for decades without undesired
effects

05:24:07.610 --> 05:24:07.620 align:start position:0%
effects
 
05:24:10.190 --> 05:24:10.200 align:start position:0%
when used properly for those infants who
 
05:24:11.868 --> 05:24:11.878 align:start position:0%
survive from a pepperstone there is no
 
05:24:13.430 --> 05:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
evidence of birth defects associated
 
05:24:15.050 --> 05:24:15.060 align:start position:0%
with the medication and the American
 
05:24:17.150 --> 05:24:17.160 align:start position:0%
Congress of of Obstetricians
 
05:24:18.470 --> 05:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
gynecologist itself has research
 
05:24:20.090 --> 05:24:20.100 align:start position:0%
confirming this
 
05:24:22.368 --> 05:24:22.378 align:start position:0%
and the efficacy of reversal is in fact
 
05:24:25.310 --> 05:24:25.320 align:start position:0%
higher than sitting and waiting alone to
 
05:24:27.708 --> 05:24:27.718 align:start position:0%
see if a pregnancy continues so while
 
05:24:29.390 --> 05:24:29.400 align:start position:0%
all that information regarding reversal
 
05:24:31.850 --> 05:24:31.860 align:start position:0%
it does have the caveat that it is not
 
05:24:34.550 --> 05:24:34.560 align:start position:0%
yet FDA approved so to say that there is
 
05:24:36.170 --> 05:24:36.180 align:start position:0%
no body of evidence is not a true
 
05:24:37.368 --> 05:24:37.378 align:start position:0%
statement it's just not a fully
 
05:24:39.230 --> 05:24:39.240 align:start position:0%
developed body and it would require
 
05:24:41.810 --> 05:24:41.820 align:start position:0%
further study but fewer women seem to
 
05:24:43.250 --> 05:24:43.260 align:start position:0%
want to attempt that or they don't know
 
05:24:44.930 --> 05:24:44.940 align:start position:0%
that that's an option that they could
 
05:24:46.910 --> 05:24:46.920 align:start position:0%
potentially reverse it so my question
 
05:24:48.948 --> 05:24:48.958 align:start position:0%
then is what is a Planned Parenthood
 
05:24:50.868 --> 05:24:50.878 align:start position:0%
telling a woman who said calls up and
 
05:24:53.208 --> 05:24:53.218 align:start position:0%
says I've taken the mepheper stone
 
05:24:56.090 --> 05:24:56.100 align:start position:0%
but I I've changed my mind what do I do
 
05:24:58.070 --> 05:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
now I'm calling that doctor or a nurse
 
05:24:59.510 --> 05:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
who admitted it within the first couple
 
05:25:02.390 --> 05:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
24 hours or so now what do I do what do
 
05:25:04.490 --> 05:25:04.500 align:start position:0%
they tell that woman then sit and wait
 
05:25:05.868 --> 05:25:05.878 align:start position:0%
and see what happens I hope for the best
 
05:25:07.310 --> 05:25:07.320 align:start position:0%
we're in the abortion business not in
 
05:25:09.350 --> 05:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
the abortion reversal business so I
 
05:25:10.430 --> 05:25:10.440 align:start position:0%
don't I don't know what they tell them
 
05:25:14.510 --> 05:25:14.520 align:start position:0%
but they do tell them that uh at home
 
05:25:17.090 --> 05:25:17.100 align:start position:0%
medication abortion care is safer than
 
05:25:19.610 --> 05:25:19.620 align:start position:0%
Tylenol now available without a clinic
 
05:25:21.890 --> 05:25:21.900 align:start position:0%
visit and available by mail in just a
 
05:25:23.868 --> 05:25:23.878 align:start position:0%
few days they also say medication
 
05:25:26.090 --> 05:25:26.100 align:start position:0%
abortion is so safe that it could be
 
05:25:28.128 --> 05:25:28.138 align:start position:0%
sold over the counter without a
 
05:25:29.628 --> 05:25:29.638 align:start position:0%
prescription if not for political
 
05:25:29.638 --> 05:25:33.590 align:start position:0%
prescription if not for political
considerations

05:25:33.590 --> 05:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:36.350 --> 05:25:36.360 align:start position:0%
they also tell a woman that it is
 
05:25:39.470 --> 05:25:39.480 align:start position:0%
just like your monthly period
 
05:25:41.868 --> 05:25:41.878 align:start position:0%
when you go to pass the fetus
 
05:25:45.410 --> 05:25:45.420 align:start position:0%
but chemical abortions are done up to at
 
05:25:47.990 --> 05:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
least 12 weeks and I I'm assuming they
 
05:25:50.208 --> 05:25:50.218 align:start position:0%
told you 15 weeks but I know I heard 12
 
05:25:50.218 --> 05:25:51.830 align:start position:0%
told you 15 weeks but I know I heard 12
weeks

05:25:51.830 --> 05:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
weeks
 
05:25:53.510 --> 05:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
would say again
 
05:25:56.270 --> 05:25:56.280 align:start position:0%
chemical Wars up to 15 weeks or 12 weeks
 
05:26:00.288 --> 05:26:00.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:02.030 --> 05:26:02.040 align:start position:0%
and this is going to be something that
 
05:26:03.830 --> 05:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
when you go when it clears your uterus
 
05:26:05.868 --> 05:26:05.878 align:start position:0%
it's going to be just like your monthly
 
05:26:05.878 --> 05:26:07.128 align:start position:0%
it's going to be just like your monthly
period

05:26:07.128 --> 05:26:07.138 align:start position:0%
period
 
05:26:08.628 --> 05:26:08.638 align:start position:0%
but I'm wondering if it might not be
 
05:26:09.830 --> 05:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
just a little bit different because
 
05:26:12.470 --> 05:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
usually your your monthly period is just
 
05:26:13.970 --> 05:26:13.980 align:start position:0%
going to be an unfertilized egg and some
 
05:26:15.350 --> 05:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
other little tissues that are attached
 
05:26:17.930 --> 05:26:17.940 align:start position:0%
to it I'm thinking that an 11 week old
 
05:26:20.330 --> 05:26:20.340 align:start position:0%
fetus might have a little bit more of a
 
05:26:25.310 --> 05:26:25.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:28.190 --> 05:26:28.200 align:start position:0%
the last thing that concerns me is that
 
05:26:29.750 --> 05:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
there is a direct link between human
 
05:26:32.270 --> 05:26:32.280 align:start position:0%
trafficking and abortions and with the
 
05:26:33.530 --> 05:26:33.540 align:start position:0%
increased frequency of chemical
 
05:26:35.930 --> 05:26:35.940 align:start position:0%
abortions and and how more readily
 
05:26:39.230 --> 05:26:39.240 align:start position:0%
available the medications are that this
 
05:26:41.330 --> 05:26:41.340 align:start position:0%
would help to feed the human trafficking
 
05:26:44.390 --> 05:26:44.400 align:start position:0%
uh because it covers the tracks of the
 
05:26:46.910 --> 05:26:46.920 align:start position:0%
perpetrators so are these women while
 
05:26:49.910 --> 05:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
there is a a an inquiry as to whether or
 
05:26:52.250 --> 05:26:52.260 align:start position:0%
not a woman is pressured into having an
 
05:26:55.250 --> 05:26:55.260 align:start position:0%
abortion I wonder if it doesn't go far
 
05:26:57.708 --> 05:26:57.718 align:start position:0%
enough as to say this could be the
 
05:26:59.628 --> 05:26:59.638 align:start position:0%
result of a rape during human
 
05:27:02.208 --> 05:27:02.218 align:start position:0%
trafficking is there even a a poster
 
05:27:03.890 --> 05:27:03.900 align:start position:0%
that says here's the national human
 
05:27:05.448 --> 05:27:05.458 align:start position:0%
trafficking hotline or something along
 
05:27:07.730 --> 05:27:07.740 align:start position:0%
those lines because this is too easy to
 
05:27:12.350 --> 05:27:12.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:16.430 --> 05:27:16.440 align:start position:0%
I I I'm liking informed consent
 
05:27:18.230 --> 05:27:18.240 align:start position:0%
I think the more you know the better
 
05:27:20.030 --> 05:27:20.040 align:start position:0%
your decisions are
 
05:27:23.390 --> 05:27:23.400 align:start position:0%
and while it may not be FDA approved
 
05:27:26.868 --> 05:27:26.878 align:start position:0%
maybe you get to be that 755th trial for
 
05:27:29.990 --> 05:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:32.330 --> 05:27:32.340 align:start position:0%
so I will oppose the ideal move
 
05:27:34.070 --> 05:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
right other
 
05:27:36.050 --> 05:27:36.060 align:start position:0%
um you then
 
05:27:38.390 --> 05:27:38.400 align:start position:0%
thank you I know okay I will vote
 
05:27:39.890 --> 05:27:39.900 align:start position:0%
against it all right that's no that's
 
05:27:41.208 --> 05:27:41.218 align:start position:0%
fine uh
 
05:27:43.910 --> 05:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
what I just went yeah yes representative
 
05:27:45.410 --> 05:27:45.420 align:start position:0%
Lantern all right then I'll get to you
 
05:27:47.330 --> 05:27:47.340 align:start position:0%
guys in just a second so um I have
 
05:27:49.190 --> 05:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
worked at a community Health Center uh
 
05:27:51.770 --> 05:27:51.780 align:start position:0%
it's a perinatal case manager there for
 
05:27:55.250 --> 05:27:55.260 align:start position:0%
many years and I so everybody who came
 
05:27:56.628 --> 05:27:56.638 align:start position:0%
through my doors
 
05:27:58.128 --> 05:27:58.138 align:start position:0%
um were found pregnant they had a
 
05:28:00.110 --> 05:28:00.120 align:start position:0%
pregnancy test
 
05:28:02.868 --> 05:28:02.878 align:start position:0%
um and then I sat down with them and I
 
05:28:05.628 --> 05:28:05.638 align:start position:0%
asked them what are I gave them Options
 
05:28:07.368 --> 05:28:07.378 align:start position:0%
Counseling so the first thing I would
 
05:28:09.650 --> 05:28:09.660 align:start position:0%
ask them is if they were looking to
 
05:28:12.288 --> 05:28:12.298 align:start position:0%
continue their pregnancy and get them
 
05:28:15.470 --> 05:28:15.480 align:start position:0%
right into care if not what um there are
 
05:28:18.708 --> 05:28:18.718 align:start position:0%
other options were to place their baby
 
05:28:20.448 --> 05:28:20.458 align:start position:0%
up for adoption
 
05:28:23.330 --> 05:28:23.340 align:start position:0%
and I would I can't tell you if I had 10
 
05:28:23.340 --> 05:28:25.310 align:start position:0%
and I would I can't tell you if I had 10
girls

05:28:25.310 --> 05:28:25.320 align:start position:0%
girls
 
05:28:27.948 --> 05:28:27.958 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't even have one sometimes that
 
05:28:30.530 --> 05:28:30.540 align:start position:0%
would offer that and I'm an adoptive
 
05:28:34.368 --> 05:28:34.378 align:start position:0%
child okay so I believe in that as well
 
05:28:37.910 --> 05:28:37.920 align:start position:0%
but at the same time I think we need to
 
05:28:39.230 --> 05:28:39.240 align:start position:0%
keep in mind
 
05:28:41.810 --> 05:28:41.820 align:start position:0%
um that we need to make sure that women
 
05:28:45.230 --> 05:28:45.240 align:start position:0%
have access to all their options and
 
05:28:48.110 --> 05:28:48.120 align:start position:0%
need to be made aware of all of their
 
05:28:51.288 --> 05:28:51.298 align:start position:0%
options I know I provided good
 
05:28:53.810 --> 05:28:53.820 align:start position:0%
um you know Options Counseling I then
 
05:28:58.490 --> 05:28:58.500 align:start position:0%
sent them if they did want to find out
 
05:29:00.890 --> 05:29:00.900 align:start position:0%
about having a termination I would then
 
05:29:03.350 --> 05:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
send them to Planned Parenthood and who
 
05:29:06.410 --> 05:29:06.420 align:start position:0%
would go further on and help them with
 
05:29:10.070 --> 05:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
that but I I know that there are people
 
05:29:11.868 --> 05:29:11.878 align:start position:0%
out there that do provide Options
 
05:29:14.990 --> 05:29:15.000 align:start position:0%
Counseling for a woman it's um people
 
05:29:18.350 --> 05:29:18.360 align:start position:0%
are not just sent away and told
 
05:29:21.770 --> 05:29:21.780 align:start position:0%
otherwise so I know that I sat with each
 
05:29:25.070 --> 05:29:25.080 align:start position:0%
individual female and gave them that
 
05:29:29.270 --> 05:29:29.280 align:start position:0%
information and stuff so thank you uh
 
05:29:30.708 --> 05:29:30.718 align:start position:0%
representative tur and then
 
05:29:32.690 --> 05:29:32.700 align:start position:0%
representative Stapleton representative
 
05:29:34.910 --> 05:29:34.920 align:start position:0%
and thank you Mr chairman
 
05:29:36.948 --> 05:29:36.958 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to mention a couple of
 
05:29:38.628 --> 05:29:38.638 align:start position:0%
things related to this I think the most
 
05:29:40.850 --> 05:29:40.860 align:start position:0%
important one being
 
05:29:45.890 --> 05:29:45.900 align:start position:0%
um informed consent uh is not given uh
 
05:29:47.930 --> 05:29:47.940 align:start position:0%
to avoid legal consequences informed
 
05:29:51.890 --> 05:29:51.900 align:start position:0%
consent is given to uh adhere to the
 
05:29:53.868 --> 05:29:53.878 align:start position:0%
standard of care to make sure that the
 
05:29:55.490 --> 05:29:55.500 align:start position:0%
patients are aware of their treatment
 
05:29:57.948 --> 05:29:57.958 align:start position:0%
and aware of their options it's given to
 
05:30:00.708 --> 05:30:00.718 align:start position:0%
avoid medical liability
 
05:30:02.628 --> 05:30:02.638 align:start position:0%
um if anything goes wrong there's a
 
05:30:04.910 --> 05:30:04.920 align:start position:0%
usually a multitude of
 
05:30:08.208 --> 05:30:08.218 align:start position:0%
of uh options and consequences related
 
05:30:10.910 --> 05:30:10.920 align:start position:0%
to any store to care including this type
 
05:30:13.970 --> 05:30:13.980 align:start position:0%
of care so that was the first uh I think
 
05:30:16.610 --> 05:30:16.620 align:start position:0%
overriding thought here is that we are
 
05:30:19.070 --> 05:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
once again stepping into an area where
 
05:30:22.010 --> 05:30:22.020 align:start position:0%
a self-regulating medical profession is
 
05:30:24.350 --> 05:30:24.360 align:start position:0%
already well taken care of this issue
 
05:30:29.110 --> 05:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
and this bill goes further to actually
 
05:30:32.150 --> 05:30:32.160 align:start position:0%
prescribe what types of information have
 
05:30:33.890 --> 05:30:33.900 align:start position:0%
to be included in informed consent
 
05:30:35.990 --> 05:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
that's not done elsewhere and I think
 
05:30:37.910 --> 05:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
for a good good reason
 
05:30:37.920 --> 05:30:38.510 align:start position:0%
for a good good reason
um

05:30:38.510 --> 05:30:38.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:30:41.448 --> 05:30:41.458 align:start position:0%
I also want to point out that um
 
05:30:44.030 --> 05:30:44.040 align:start position:0%
the executive director of the loving
 
05:30:45.650 --> 05:30:45.660 align:start position:0%
Center in terms of whether women are
 
05:30:47.628 --> 05:30:47.638 align:start position:0%
offered other options pointed out during
 
05:30:50.570 --> 05:30:50.580 align:start position:0%
her testimony that the first line of
 
05:30:52.490 --> 05:30:52.500 align:start position:0%
their informed consent goes through
 
05:30:55.490 --> 05:30:55.500 align:start position:0%
options other than abortion and that has
 
05:30:58.250 --> 05:30:58.260 align:start position:0%
to be signed by every patient following
 
05:31:00.410 --> 05:31:00.420 align:start position:0%
an hour of consultation
 
05:31:02.570 --> 05:31:02.580 align:start position:0%
regarding the procedure so I do think
 
05:31:05.448 --> 05:31:05.458 align:start position:0%
this is being done I do think people are
 
05:31:07.310 --> 05:31:07.320 align:start position:0%
being being offered their options and
 
05:31:10.128 --> 05:31:10.138 align:start position:0%
the other thing and I will apologize uh
 
05:31:12.470 --> 05:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
I took this in notes and never looked
 
05:31:16.010 --> 05:31:16.020 align:start position:0%
into the actual study but it was pointed
 
05:31:17.930 --> 05:31:17.940 align:start position:0%
out to us that Acog
 
05:31:20.208 --> 05:31:20.218 align:start position:0%
doesn't support the reversal of
 
05:31:23.770 --> 05:31:23.780 align:start position:0%
medication abortion as a as a a
 
05:31:28.368 --> 05:31:28.378 align:start position:0%
legitimate course of care the other
 
05:31:30.708 --> 05:31:30.718 align:start position:0%
um actions that I think were cited
 
05:31:32.990 --> 05:31:33.000 align:start position:0%
relate to other instances where this
 
05:31:34.610 --> 05:31:34.620 align:start position:0%
drug is used and you're found to be
 
05:31:36.830 --> 05:31:36.840 align:start position:0%
pregnant I think I do not know I do not
 
05:31:38.690 --> 05:31:38.700 align:start position:0%
have the study but it was mentioned to
 
05:31:41.628 --> 05:31:41.638 align:start position:0%
us that a clinical trial exploring the
 
05:31:43.250 --> 05:31:43.260 align:start position:0%
concept of reversing medication
 
05:31:45.590 --> 05:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
abortions was halted you know if you all
 
05:31:47.208 --> 05:31:47.218 align:start position:0%
remember that testimony during during
 
05:31:50.390 --> 05:31:50.400 align:start position:0%
our hearing so I I would support the
 
05:31:54.708 --> 05:31:54.718 align:start position:0%
ideal motion representative Stapleton
 
05:31:59.208 --> 05:31:59.218 align:start position:0%
upon listening to the testimony here
 
05:32:02.750 --> 05:32:02.760 align:start position:0%
and I just reviewed the testimony in my
 
05:32:07.850 --> 05:32:07.860 align:start position:0%
notes when we had the hearing on this
 
05:32:09.470 --> 05:32:09.480 align:start position:0%
I've had a change of mind and I would
 
05:32:13.310 --> 05:32:13.320 align:start position:0%
like to withdraw my itl motion
 
05:32:15.110 --> 05:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
and as representative would you like to
 
05:32:17.390 --> 05:32:17.400 align:start position:0%
withdraw your second all right so the
 
05:32:21.288 --> 05:32:21.298 align:start position:0%
question then is um is there a do we
 
05:32:25.368 --> 05:32:25.378 align:start position:0%
have a motion on the floor
 
05:32:27.708 --> 05:32:27.718 align:start position:0%
um is there a motion Mr chair I move we
 
05:32:30.890 --> 05:32:30.900 align:start position:0%
ought to pass house bill 562.
 
05:32:32.628 --> 05:32:32.638 align:start position:0%
all right is there a second all right

yes please
 
05:32:53.868 --> 05:32:53.878 align:start position:0%
the other the other
 
05:32:56.868 --> 05:32:56.878 align:start position:0%
talk I had with Planned Parenthood is
 
05:33:00.708 --> 05:33:00.718 align:start position:0%
because I was not I'm not up to date on
 
05:33:03.850 --> 05:33:03.860 align:start position:0%
taking these pills I did intensive care
 
05:33:07.788 --> 05:33:07.798 align:start position:0%
so one of my concerns was again I used
 
05:33:10.970 --> 05:33:10.980 align:start position:0%
the 18 year old and um I said I'm an 18
 
05:33:12.590 --> 05:33:12.600 align:start position:0%
year old girl I'm about to graduate from
 
05:33:14.030 --> 05:33:14.040 align:start position:0%
high school I'm going to college I'm
 
05:33:15.890 --> 05:33:15.900 align:start position:0%
pregnant I want I don't want to go to
 
05:33:17.930 --> 05:33:17.940 align:start position:0%
the abortion clinic I don't want
 
05:33:19.670 --> 05:33:19.680 align:start position:0%
somebody to see me can I take these
 
05:33:19.680 --> 05:33:21.050 align:start position:0%
somebody to see me can I take these
pills

05:33:21.050 --> 05:33:21.060 align:start position:0%
pills
 
05:33:23.270 --> 05:33:23.280 align:start position:0%
how do you know
 
05:33:27.530 --> 05:33:27.540 align:start position:0%
I am under 11 weeks pregnant well I
 
05:33:29.270 --> 05:33:29.280 align:start position:0%
asked you when your last period was I
 
05:33:31.850 --> 05:33:31.860 align:start position:0%
said well I'm 18 years old I'm scared to
 
05:33:34.070 --> 05:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
death I know I'm at least 12 or 13 weeks
 
05:33:35.570 --> 05:33:35.580 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna lie
 
05:33:38.930 --> 05:33:38.940 align:start position:0%
how do you and it's my understanding you
 
05:33:40.910 --> 05:33:40.920 align:start position:0%
could actually die from these pills if
 
05:33:43.368 --> 05:33:43.378 align:start position:0%
you have them over a period of time over
 
05:33:46.070 --> 05:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
a certain gestation she said well you
 
05:33:48.050 --> 05:33:48.060 align:start position:0%
can have an ultrasound I said I'm 18
 
05:33:49.788 --> 05:33:49.798 align:start position:0%
years old I'm not going to subject
 
05:33:51.708 --> 05:33:51.718 align:start position:0%
myself to an ultrasound and have you
 
05:33:53.868 --> 05:33:53.878 align:start position:0%
find out I need to have this abortion I
 
05:33:57.770 --> 05:33:57.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:57.780 --> 05:33:59.330 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:33:59.330 --> 05:33:59.340 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:34:02.270 --> 05:34:02.280 align:start position:0%
are you going to tell me when I walk in
 
05:34:05.690 --> 05:34:05.700 align:start position:0%
to get my first pill that you know you
 
05:34:07.368 --> 05:34:07.378 align:start position:0%
know if you're over 11 weeks you really
 
05:34:10.670 --> 05:34:10.680 align:start position:0%
could die you really could die
 
05:34:13.490 --> 05:34:13.500 align:start position:0%
I need to know that I need to know
 
05:34:18.050 --> 05:34:18.060 align:start position:0%
what's going on before I'm there
 
05:34:23.510 --> 05:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:25.430 --> 05:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
the way that the bill is currently
 
05:34:28.788 --> 05:34:28.798 align:start position:0%
written has medical information that is
 
05:34:30.770 --> 05:34:30.780 align:start position:0%
known to be false
 
05:34:33.590 --> 05:34:33.600 align:start position:0%
and I do not believe that we'd be acting
 
05:34:35.930 --> 05:34:35.940 align:start position:0%
in good faith to require a position
 
05:34:39.830 --> 05:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
legally to obligate them to give
 
05:34:42.890 --> 05:34:42.900 align:start position:0%
patients information that they know
 
05:34:45.288 --> 05:34:45.298 align:start position:0%
is inaccurate so for that reason I will
 
05:34:47.030 --> 05:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
not be submorting
 
05:34:49.850 --> 05:34:49.860 align:start position:0%
the OTP motion anyone else wish to be
 
05:34:51.110 --> 05:34:51.120 align:start position:0%
heard on this
 
05:34:53.330 --> 05:34:53.340 align:start position:0%
yes representative Staples
 
05:34:56.690 --> 05:34:56.700 align:start position:0%
and part of this to explain why I had a
 
05:34:58.368 --> 05:34:58.378 align:start position:0%
change of mind
 
05:35:01.490 --> 05:35:01.500 align:start position:0%
to withdraw my motion
 
05:35:03.830 --> 05:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
informed consent there's got to be
 
05:35:07.730 --> 05:35:07.740 align:start position:0%
specific to the procedure involved
 
05:35:07.740 --> 05:35:09.350 align:start position:0%
specific to the procedure involved
and

05:35:09.350 --> 05:35:09.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:35:11.330 --> 05:35:11.340 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about abortion that's
 
05:35:12.770 --> 05:35:12.780 align:start position:0%
a special
 
05:35:12.780 --> 05:35:14.750 align:start position:0%
a special
aspect

05:35:14.750 --> 05:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
aspect
 
05:35:18.410 --> 05:35:18.420 align:start position:0%
of clinical operation
 
05:35:20.390 --> 05:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
and it should be
 
05:35:22.190 --> 05:35:22.200 align:start position:0%
replete with
 
05:35:26.990 --> 05:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
complete spectrum of all possibilities
 
05:35:29.930 --> 05:35:29.940 align:start position:0%
and especially to guard against the Bad
 
05:35:29.940 --> 05:35:31.750 align:start position:0%
and especially to guard against the Bad
actors

05:35:31.750 --> 05:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
actors
 
05:35:35.030 --> 05:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
the people who would not observe best
 
05:35:36.910 --> 05:35:36.920 align:start position:0%
practices Medical
 
05:35:40.368 --> 05:35:40.378 align:start position:0%
professionalism or even the law
 
05:35:40.378 --> 05:35:42.590 align:start position:0%
professionalism or even the law
so

05:35:42.590 --> 05:35:42.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:35:44.990 --> 05:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
I believe we need to
 
05:35:48.350 --> 05:35:48.360 align:start position:0%
put the statement out there in law that
 
05:35:51.050 --> 05:35:51.060 align:start position:0%
this is a special
 
05:35:54.230 --> 05:35:54.240 align:start position:0%
situation and like other medical
 
05:35:57.410 --> 05:35:57.420 align:start position:0%
procedures that are special that need to
 
05:36:00.250 --> 05:36:00.260 align:start position:0%
inform consent that's tailored to that
 
05:36:03.230 --> 05:36:03.240 align:start position:0%
including options which I think is part
 
05:36:06.310 --> 05:36:06.320 align:start position:0%
of informed consent anyways
 
05:36:10.730 --> 05:36:10.740 align:start position:0%
for a patient to make a valid decision
 
05:36:13.910 --> 05:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
um but I I do here and we do know that
 
05:36:15.190 --> 05:36:15.200 align:start position:0%
there are
 
05:36:18.470 --> 05:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
improper practices out there Bad actors
 
05:36:22.850 --> 05:36:22.860 align:start position:0%
even if the majority of providers in
 
05:36:25.670 --> 05:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
abortions are observing the law and
 
05:36:27.288 --> 05:36:27.298 align:start position:0%
would so do
 
05:36:30.170 --> 05:36:30.180 align:start position:0%
by conscience
 
05:36:30.180 --> 05:36:31.610 align:start position:0%
by conscience
um

05:36:31.610 --> 05:36:31.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:36:35.090 --> 05:36:35.100 align:start position:0%
as my on my other life I'm a pro-life
 
05:36:35.100 --> 05:36:37.250 align:start position:0%
as my on my other life I'm a pro-life
sidewalk

05:36:37.250 --> 05:36:37.260 align:start position:0%
sidewalk
 
05:36:41.510 --> 05:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
Advocate and in in a group known as
 
05:36:43.850 --> 05:36:43.860 align:start position:0%
Upper Valley Pray For Life
 
05:36:46.910 --> 05:36:46.920 align:start position:0%
and we would have a prayerful respectful
 
05:36:49.310 --> 05:36:49.320 align:start position:0%
lawful presence outside of abortion
 
05:36:49.320 --> 05:36:50.628 align:start position:0%
lawful presence outside of abortion
clinics

05:36:50.628 --> 05:36:50.638 align:start position:0%
clinics
 
05:36:54.470 --> 05:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
to offer help advice alternatives
 
05:36:57.230 --> 05:36:57.240 align:start position:0%
as well as prayers for people going in
 
05:36:59.090 --> 05:36:59.100 align:start position:0%
there and having the abortions as well
 
05:37:02.628 --> 05:37:02.638 align:start position:0%
as those deciding not to have abortions
 
05:37:05.510 --> 05:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
because a woman that has abortion has
 
05:37:07.610 --> 05:37:07.620 align:start position:0%
got a heavy load to bear
 
05:37:11.570 --> 05:37:11.580 align:start position:0%
and they need support and prayer as well
 
05:37:14.570 --> 05:37:14.580 align:start position:0%
but I saw many coming out of
 
05:37:18.110 --> 05:37:18.120 align:start position:0%
abortion clinics in in a sorrowful
 
05:37:18.120 --> 05:37:19.730 align:start position:0%
abortion clinics in in a sorrowful
tearful

05:37:19.730 --> 05:37:19.740 align:start position:0%
tearful
 
05:37:21.948 --> 05:37:21.958 align:start position:0%
hurtful mode
 
05:37:21.958 --> 05:37:24.708 align:start position:0%
hurtful mode
after

05:37:24.708 --> 05:37:24.718 align:start position:0%
after
 
05:37:27.050 --> 05:37:27.060 align:start position:0%
reality sets in and they see what
 
05:37:29.030 --> 05:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
they've done counter to maybe their
 
05:37:31.250 --> 05:37:31.260 align:start position:0%
family values or their religious values
 
05:37:34.788 --> 05:37:34.798 align:start position:0%
or their ethical values and so I have to
 
05:37:36.948 --> 05:37:36.958 align:start position:0%
ask the question were they given proper
 
05:37:41.030 --> 05:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
informed consent relative to options and
 
05:37:41.040 --> 05:37:42.350 align:start position:0%
informed consent relative to options and
alternatives

05:37:42.350 --> 05:37:42.360 align:start position:0%
alternatives
 
05:37:46.610 --> 05:37:46.620 align:start position:0%
well that's why I had to withdraw my
 
05:37:50.930 --> 05:37:50.940 align:start position:0%
motion and in favor of the OTP anyone
 
05:37:52.670 --> 05:37:52.680 align:start position:0%
else wish to speak on the representative
 
05:37:52.680 --> 05:37:53.750 align:start position:0%
else wish to speak on the representative
Oregon

05:37:53.750 --> 05:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
Oregon
 
05:37:56.868 --> 05:37:56.878 align:start position:0%
um thank you um I mean I feel uh
 
05:37:58.730 --> 05:37:58.740 align:start position:0%
yeah I feel uncomfortable with forcing
 
05:38:00.410 --> 05:38:00.420 align:start position:0%
uh the well they're talking about the
 
05:38:02.868 --> 05:38:02.878 align:start position:0%
adoption that does involve the uh
 
05:38:02.878 --> 05:38:03.948 align:start position:0%
adoption that does involve the uh
the woman

05:38:03.948 --> 05:38:03.958 align:start position:0%
the woman
 
05:38:06.288 --> 05:38:06.298 align:start position:0%
um you know burying the baby for nine
 
05:38:09.110 --> 05:38:09.120 align:start position:0%
months and that's uh a life-altering uh
 
05:38:10.970 --> 05:38:10.980 align:start position:0%
experience in and of itself even if you
 
05:38:13.430 --> 05:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
have the baby up for adoption I don't
 
05:38:16.550 --> 05:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
and um they these adoption agencies this
 
05:38:19.010 --> 05:38:19.020 align:start position:0%
doesn't address the issue of a
 
05:38:21.410 --> 05:38:21.420 align:start position:0%
licensing the adoption agencies it does
 
05:38:24.110 --> 05:38:24.120 align:start position:0%
say um it I mean it does say there's
 
05:38:27.230 --> 05:38:27.240 align:start position:0%
supposed to be a geographically indexed
 
05:38:29.690 --> 05:38:29.700 align:start position:0%
materials but there's no detail on like
 
05:38:31.490 --> 05:38:31.500 align:start position:0%
how do you know which adoption agencies
 
05:38:31.500 --> 05:38:32.750 align:start position:0%
how do you know which adoption agencies
are

05:38:32.750 --> 05:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:38:35.510 --> 05:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
you know can be trusted in which can't
 
05:38:37.010 --> 05:38:37.020 align:start position:0%
so there doesn't seem anything to
 
05:38:39.350 --> 05:38:39.360 align:start position:0%
address like licensing or supervision of
 
05:38:42.650 --> 05:38:42.660 align:start position:0%
those and there's certainly a ample ways
 
05:38:45.650 --> 05:38:45.660 align:start position:0%
that could be uh that could be abused
 
05:38:47.930 --> 05:38:47.940 align:start position:0%
and it also uh
 
05:38:51.890 --> 05:38:51.900 align:start position:0%
and like I said vaguely refers to uh
 
05:38:54.128 --> 05:38:54.138 align:start position:0%
services available
 
05:38:56.390 --> 05:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
upon Chopper while the child is
 
05:38:57.890 --> 05:38:57.900 align:start position:0%
dependent but this bill doesn't do
 
05:39:01.070 --> 05:39:01.080 align:start position:0%
anything about uh programs to help
 
05:39:04.150 --> 05:39:04.160 align:start position:0%
young women who are raising babies
 
05:39:06.770 --> 05:39:06.780 align:start position:0%
either by themselves or with the help of
 
05:39:06.780 --> 05:39:08.150 align:start position:0%
either by themselves or with the help of
a

05:39:08.150 --> 05:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:39:10.310 --> 05:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
you know equally equally young partner
 
05:39:12.470 --> 05:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
and there are some excellent programs in
 
05:39:13.910 --> 05:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that deal with that but
 
05:39:15.590 --> 05:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
this bill does nothing for it it doesn't
 
05:39:17.090 --> 05:39:17.100 align:start position:0%
prodify to any
 
05:39:21.350 --> 05:39:21.360 align:start position:0%
funding for the adoption agencies or the
 
05:39:24.430 --> 05:39:24.440 align:start position:0%
or the uh you know the agencies to help
 
05:39:27.470 --> 05:39:27.480 align:start position:0%
help young women raise their uh raise
 
05:39:30.590 --> 05:39:30.600 align:start position:0%
their babies and also um we could we
 
05:39:32.390 --> 05:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
hear a lot about unfunded mandates here
 
05:39:35.750 --> 05:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
if we um this bill provides you know
 
05:39:38.510 --> 05:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
provides no provides no funding even
 
05:39:40.010 --> 05:39:40.020 align:start position:0%
though the fiscal note clearly says
 
05:39:42.410 --> 05:39:42.420 align:start position:0%
there's a very significant cost involved
 
05:39:44.750 --> 05:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
so I think it's a
 
05:39:47.930 --> 05:39:47.940 align:start position:0%
and uh so I just think this bill is uh
 
05:39:50.990 --> 05:39:51.000 align:start position:0%
unnecessary and counterproductive so
 
05:39:53.510 --> 05:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:55.010 --> 05:39:55.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
05:39:56.750 --> 05:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
it should be pointed out that the bill
 
05:39:59.510 --> 05:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
clearly states that all references to
 
05:40:01.910 --> 05:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
the reversal of a chemical abortion the
 
05:40:04.970 --> 05:40:04.980 align:start position:0%
procedure is not yet FDA approved that
 
05:40:06.590 --> 05:40:06.600 align:start position:0%
does not mean it is dangerous medical
 
05:40:09.530 --> 05:40:09.540 align:start position:0%
misinformation the procedure is just not
 
05:40:12.830 --> 05:40:12.840 align:start position:0%
FDA approved so either way the woman is
 
05:40:14.990 --> 05:40:15.000 align:start position:0%
not going to get complete accurate 100
 
05:40:18.770 --> 05:40:18.780 align:start position:0%
percent medical information one way or
 
05:40:22.128 --> 05:40:22.138 align:start position:0%
the other either it is either the you
 
05:40:23.750 --> 05:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
have to tell her it is impossible to
 
05:40:25.730 --> 05:40:25.740 align:start position:0%
reverse it or that it is possible to
 
05:40:28.190 --> 05:40:28.200 align:start position:0%
reverse it which one is it
 
05:40:30.590 --> 05:40:30.600 align:start position:0%
when they themselves say there's just no
 
05:40:32.510 --> 05:40:32.520 align:start position:0%
body of evidence to say it
 
05:40:34.430 --> 05:40:34.440 align:start position:0%
so it's not dangerous medical
 
05:40:36.350 --> 05:40:36.360 align:start position:0%
misinformation it's just not FDA
 
05:40:36.360 --> 05:40:38.390 align:start position:0%
misinformation it's just not FDA
approved

05:40:38.390 --> 05:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
approved
 
05:40:40.910 --> 05:40:40.920 align:start position:0%
any other comments
 
05:40:43.070 --> 05:40:43.080 align:start position:0%
well yes representative
 
05:40:45.890 --> 05:40:45.900 align:start position:0%
I just want to say too I think it's Phil
 
05:40:47.750 --> 05:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
um this bill though is filled with some
 
05:40:50.750 --> 05:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
misinformation and that we need to think
 
05:40:52.850 --> 05:40:52.860 align:start position:0%
about you know
 
05:40:56.330 --> 05:40:56.340 align:start position:0%
um that women do understand about their
 
05:40:58.910 --> 05:40:58.920 align:start position:0%
bodies their own bodies and wish as New
 
05:41:00.830 --> 05:41:00.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legislators should not make
 
05:41:03.590 --> 05:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
that decision for them
 
05:41:05.150 --> 05:41:05.160 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to come yes
 
05:41:07.788 --> 05:41:07.798 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair I
 
05:41:09.230 --> 05:41:09.240 align:start position:0%
wanted to just say
 
05:41:11.990 --> 05:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
um uh respond to uh representative
 
05:41:14.208 --> 05:41:14.218 align:start position:0%
catawb and completely support what she
 
05:41:17.628 --> 05:41:17.638 align:start position:0%
said that we can't in good faith be uh
 
05:41:20.628 --> 05:41:20.638 align:start position:0%
dictating and putting into a statute
 
05:41:23.448 --> 05:41:23.458 align:start position:0%
medical misinformation
 
05:41:26.930 --> 05:41:26.940 align:start position:0%
um and so I strongly oppose the of the
 
05:41:29.868 --> 05:41:29.878 align:start position:0%
OTP anyone else wish to be hurt yes
 
05:41:32.330 --> 05:41:32.340 align:start position:0%
representative De Lorenzo thank you um
 
05:41:35.330 --> 05:41:35.340 align:start position:0%
for taking my question or comment
 
05:41:38.810 --> 05:41:38.820 align:start position:0%
um you know I think that
 
05:41:42.830 --> 05:41:42.840 align:start position:0%
18 year old woman are adults
 
05:41:45.050 --> 05:41:45.060 align:start position:0%
I think that
 
05:41:47.750 --> 05:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
young people are very well educated
 
05:41:51.250 --> 05:41:51.260 align:start position:0%
today they have access to the internet
 
05:41:54.650 --> 05:41:54.660 align:start position:0%
and they have Circles of friends
 
05:41:58.550 --> 05:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
allergy teachers and
 
05:42:01.190 --> 05:42:01.200 align:start position:0%
they certainly have access to the
 
05:42:02.990 --> 05:42:03.000 align:start position:0%
information that's out there about
 
05:42:05.090 --> 05:42:05.100 align:start position:0%
making decisions
 
05:42:06.470 --> 05:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:42:08.930 --> 05:42:08.940 align:start position:0%
anyone else any other comments so I
 
05:42:12.708 --> 05:42:12.718 align:start position:0%
guess I would say just my comment I um I
 
05:42:15.770 --> 05:42:15.780 align:start position:0%
am I cannot support the OTP Motion in
 
05:42:19.610 --> 05:42:19.620 align:start position:0%
this um I certainly agree
 
05:42:21.410 --> 05:42:21.420 align:start position:0%
that there should be informed consent
 
05:42:23.448 --> 05:42:23.458 align:start position:0%
but I candidly
 
05:42:26.570 --> 05:42:26.580 align:start position:0%
if you look at this at what this bill
 
05:42:29.510 --> 05:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
requires it's not this goes beyond
 
05:42:32.390 --> 05:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
informed consent it's really sort of
 
05:42:34.970 --> 05:42:34.980 align:start position:0%
designed to in to kind of intimidate
 
05:42:36.830 --> 05:42:36.840 align:start position:0%
let's that's my view intimidate a woman
 
05:42:39.470 --> 05:42:39.480 align:start position:0%
into not having an abortion and I think
 
05:42:40.910 --> 05:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
that goes too far
 
05:42:43.250 --> 05:42:43.260 align:start position:0%
and I really also think and and I'm not
 
05:42:45.410 --> 05:42:45.420 align:start position:0%
someone who you know who who finds
 
05:42:48.948 --> 05:42:48.958 align:start position:0%
things offensive very easily but if I
 
05:42:51.230 --> 05:42:51.240 align:start position:0%
were a woman I would find this form
 
05:42:54.708 --> 05:42:54.718 align:start position:0%
Verity demeaning along for basically for
 
05:42:56.330 --> 05:42:56.340 align:start position:0%
the reasons that representative De
 
05:43:00.770 --> 05:43:00.780 align:start position:0%
Lorenzo said that it it really sort of
 
05:43:00.780 --> 05:43:03.010 align:start position:0%
Lorenzo said that it it really sort of
um

05:43:03.010 --> 05:43:03.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:07.128 --> 05:43:07.138 align:start position:0%
cast The View that you know an adult
 
05:43:09.890 --> 05:43:09.900 align:start position:0%
woman is is someone that really needs to
 
05:43:13.190 --> 05:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
you know needs the protection of a man I
 
05:43:14.990 --> 05:43:15.000 align:start position:0%
suppose that's the theory or of somebody
 
05:43:17.090 --> 05:43:17.100 align:start position:0%
else other than the woman herself
 
05:43:20.990 --> 05:43:21.000 align:start position:0%
because she's not capable of uh of
 
05:43:23.090 --> 05:43:23.100 align:start position:0%
making an informed decision even when it
 
05:43:25.368 --> 05:43:25.378 align:start position:0%
may be a very hard decision I don't
 
05:43:27.530 --> 05:43:27.540 align:start position:0%
think that that's true I think that 18
 
05:43:30.110 --> 05:43:30.120 align:start position:0%
year old women you know could there be
 
05:43:32.510 --> 05:43:32.520 align:start position:0%
some cases of of there being coercedure
 
05:43:35.150 --> 05:43:35.160 align:start position:0%
I don't doubt that but
 
05:43:38.990 --> 05:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
um this this just this this bill it
 
05:43:40.850 --> 05:43:40.860 align:start position:0%
seems to be just goes too far so I I
 
05:43:43.550 --> 05:43:43.560 align:start position:0%
cannot support the OTP on this anyone
 
05:43:46.490 --> 05:43:46.500 align:start position:0%
else uh wish wish to be heard
 
05:43:47.990 --> 05:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
all right I think we're ready for revoke

House Bill 591
um

05:47:20.990 --> 05:47:21.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:47:23.570 --> 05:47:23.580 align:start position:0%
prohibiting abortions after detection of
 
05:47:26.330 --> 05:47:26.340 align:start position:0%
fetal heartbeat and I rep I recognize uh
 
05:47:28.670 --> 05:47:28.680 align:start position:0%
representative cutoff for a motion
 
05:47:31.010 --> 05:47:31.020 align:start position:0%
I make a motion to itl
 
05:47:32.810 --> 05:47:32.820 align:start position:0%
for a second
 
05:47:34.490 --> 05:47:34.500 align:start position:0%
I can do it
 
05:47:36.230 --> 05:47:36.240 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry who was that
 
05:47:38.208 --> 05:47:38.218 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander okay all right
 
05:47:39.948 --> 05:47:39.958 align:start position:0%
uh representative Tom if you'd like to
 
05:47:43.610 --> 05:47:43.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:46.128 --> 05:47:46.138 align:start position:0%
so I'm here to represent how the
 
05:47:48.650 --> 05:47:48.660 align:start position:0%
majority of my constituents feel and I
 
05:47:51.770 --> 05:47:51.780 align:start position:0%
think it's been made very clear that the
 
05:47:51.780 --> 05:47:53.090 align:start position:0%
think it's been made very clear that the
majority

05:47:53.090 --> 05:47:53.100 align:start position:0%
majority
 
05:47:55.970 --> 05:47:55.980 align:start position:0%
feel that there should be an option for
 
05:47:58.850 --> 05:47:58.860 align:start position:0%
women to have the Liberty to make these
 
05:48:00.110 --> 05:48:00.120 align:start position:0%
decisions with their health care
 
05:48:03.470 --> 05:48:03.480 align:start position:0%
providers and this is a near total
 
05:48:05.930 --> 05:48:05.940 align:start position:0%
abortion ban which is just
 
05:48:08.810 --> 05:48:08.820 align:start position:0%
by far polling data has shown that it's
 
05:48:11.830 --> 05:48:11.840 align:start position:0%
a slim number of people
 
05:48:14.090 --> 05:48:14.100 align:start position:0%
that support that and that the vast
 
05:48:17.330 --> 05:48:17.340 align:start position:0%
majority do not so especially given the
 
05:48:20.628 --> 05:48:20.638 align:start position:0%
idea that I know I personally when I was
 
05:48:23.150 --> 05:48:23.160 align:start position:0%
pregnant with my daughter her her fetal
 
05:48:25.548 --> 05:48:25.558 align:start position:0%
heartbeat was shown on ultrasound at
 
05:48:27.708 --> 05:48:27.718 align:start position:0%
five weeks six days
 
05:48:30.470 --> 05:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
that's often times before somebody even
 
05:48:34.070 --> 05:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
knows that they're pregnant so
 
05:48:36.650 --> 05:48:36.660 align:start position:0%
I think we need to to you know
 
05:48:38.990 --> 05:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
keep that into consideration so thank
 
05:48:39.000 --> 05:48:40.070 align:start position:0%
keep that into consideration so thank
you

05:48:40.070 --> 05:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:48:42.650 --> 05:48:42.660 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to speak to the itl
 
05:48:47.330 --> 05:48:47.340 align:start position:0%
motion on House Bill 591. yeah this was
 
05:48:50.448 --> 05:48:50.458 align:start position:0%
was my bill this was put in
 
05:48:52.610 --> 05:48:52.620 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of argument when they
 
05:48:54.128 --> 05:48:54.138 align:start position:0%
put the
 
05:48:57.770 --> 05:48:57.780 align:start position:0%
bill that finally passed 24 weeks in
 
05:49:01.430 --> 05:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
about should we have a
 
05:49:01.440 --> 05:49:04.330 align:start position:0%
about should we have a
a

05:49:04.330 --> 05:49:04.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:06.708 --> 05:49:06.718 align:start position:0%
ultrasound or what should we have there
 
05:49:08.390 --> 05:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
are all sorts of arguments
 
05:49:11.090 --> 05:49:11.100 align:start position:0%
I put this in not because
 
05:49:13.190 --> 05:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
I thought it was right because I would
 
05:49:16.670 --> 05:49:16.680 align:start position:0%
put zero weeks as a cut off
 
05:49:20.510 --> 05:49:20.520 align:start position:0%
but yeah but because it was one it was
 
05:49:22.368 --> 05:49:22.378 align:start position:0%
really relatively simple
 
05:49:28.070 --> 05:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
a uh a a almost any doctor
 
05:49:30.470 --> 05:49:30.480 align:start position:0%
with this stethoscope you can determine
 
05:49:32.570 --> 05:49:32.580 align:start position:0%
if there's a heartbeat period end of
 
05:49:35.628 --> 05:49:35.638 align:start position:0%
story uh and if you can't make a
 
05:49:38.150 --> 05:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
decision at that point it's just hard
 
05:49:40.930 --> 05:49:40.940 align:start position:0%
for me to believe so I'll vote for this
 
05:49:44.510 --> 05:49:44.520 align:start position:0%
even though I know it makes the number
 
05:49:49.610 --> 05:49:49.620 align:start position:0%
of weeks five or six maybe ten uh yeah
 
05:49:54.288 --> 05:49:54.298 align:start position:0%
but but it's it's a simple solution and
 
05:49:56.390 --> 05:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
it's you know it pretty much does the
 
05:49:56.400 --> 05:49:57.410 align:start position:0%
it's you know it pretty much does the
job

05:49:57.410 --> 05:49:57.420 align:start position:0%
job
 
05:49:59.510 --> 05:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
all right anyone else wish to speak to
 
05:50:01.368 --> 05:50:01.378 align:start position:0%
uh House Bill 591 representative Greece
 
05:50:04.070 --> 05:50:04.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair one of the arguments
 
05:50:06.110 --> 05:50:06.120 align:start position:0%
in support of abortions is that the baby
 
05:50:08.330 --> 05:50:08.340 align:start position:0%
is not viable outside the womb before
 
05:50:11.030 --> 05:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
some number of weeks 24 weeks for
 
05:50:13.010 --> 05:50:13.020 align:start position:0%
example and therefore abortions should
 
05:50:15.288 --> 05:50:15.298 align:start position:0%
be unrestricted but that misses the
 
05:50:17.750 --> 05:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
whole point the baby is not intended to
 
05:50:20.390 --> 05:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
survive outside the womb before 24 weeks
 
05:50:22.850 --> 05:50:22.860 align:start position:0%
in fact the baby's not intended to be
 
05:50:25.010 --> 05:50:25.020 align:start position:0%
viable outside the womb before nine
 
05:50:26.570 --> 05:50:26.580 align:start position:0%
months that's why they're called
 
05:50:29.570 --> 05:50:29.580 align:start position:0%
premature babies nine months is the
 
05:50:31.610 --> 05:50:31.620 align:start position:0%
normal gestation period for a human baby
 
05:50:33.350 --> 05:50:33.360 align:start position:0%
thank God you're not an elephant because
 
05:50:34.788 --> 05:50:34.798 align:start position:0%
it's two years
 
05:50:37.970 --> 05:50:37.980 align:start position:0%
the fact that a baby can survive being
 
05:50:40.730 --> 05:50:40.740 align:start position:0%
born before full development is simply a
 
05:50:42.530 --> 05:50:42.540 align:start position:0%
miracle and medical advancements have
 
05:50:44.570 --> 05:50:44.580 align:start position:0%
made survival at younger ages much more
 
05:50:47.208 --> 05:50:47.218 align:start position:0%
realistic but none of these is easy or
 
05:50:47.218 --> 05:50:48.530 align:start position:0%
realistic but none of these is easy or
ideal

05:50:48.530 --> 05:50:48.540 align:start position:0%
ideal
 
05:50:50.628 --> 05:50:50.638 align:start position:0%
philosophically I agree with
 
05:50:52.850 --> 05:50:52.860 align:start position:0%
representative testerman
 
05:50:55.070 --> 05:50:55.080 align:start position:0%
five weeks is
 
05:50:56.510 --> 05:50:56.520 align:start position:0%
goes beyond what I believe
 
05:51:00.048 --> 05:51:00.058 align:start position:0%
philosophically unfortunately
 
05:51:02.990 --> 05:51:03.000 align:start position:0%
I also agree with representative cutoff
 
05:51:04.970 --> 05:51:04.980 align:start position:0%
we're just not there
 
05:51:06.708 --> 05:51:06.718 align:start position:0%
I like the idea of leaving the fetal
 
05:51:08.390 --> 05:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
Life protection act alone I don't think
 
05:51:09.650 --> 05:51:09.660 align:start position:0%
we're going to advance the front any
 
05:51:11.390 --> 05:51:11.400 align:start position:0%
farther I think it becomes a heart issue
 
05:51:14.208 --> 05:51:14.218 align:start position:0%
at that point and it's not a polit it's
 
05:51:15.470 --> 05:51:15.480 align:start position:0%
not a it's not a simple solution
 
05:51:18.590 --> 05:51:18.600 align:start position:0%
whatsoever I just don't I I agree with
 
05:51:22.190 --> 05:51:22.200 align:start position:0%
the principle of uh of the feedlife or
 
05:51:24.230 --> 05:51:24.240 align:start position:0%
excuse me of the uh
 
05:51:26.750 --> 05:51:26.760 align:start position:0%
the fetal heartbeat bill but I'm afraid
 
05:51:28.368 --> 05:51:28.378 align:start position:0%
that we're just not in a place right now
 
05:51:30.230 --> 05:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
where that's going to pass and I would
 
05:51:31.730 --> 05:51:31.740 align:start position:0%
have I want to support the itl now
 
05:51:34.850 --> 05:51:34.860 align:start position:0%
because I actually agree with uh or
 
05:51:37.010 --> 05:51:37.020 align:start position:0%
disagree with its tenants but I just
 
05:51:38.690 --> 05:51:38.700 align:start position:0%
don't think we're there
 
05:51:40.730 --> 05:51:40.740 align:start position:0%
thank you representative uh anyone else
 
05:51:42.530 --> 05:51:42.540 align:start position:0%
wish to speak yes representative tur
 
05:51:45.288 --> 05:51:45.298 align:start position:0%
yeah just just one quick what I hope to
 
05:51:46.910 --> 05:51:46.920 align:start position:0%
be factual correction
 
05:51:49.128 --> 05:51:49.138 align:start position:0%
um a stethoscope cannot as far as I
 
05:51:52.070 --> 05:51:52.080 align:start position:0%
understand detect a heartbeat at um
 
05:51:55.788 --> 05:51:55.798 align:start position:0%
at the a six-week level uh there's no
 
05:51:57.410 --> 05:51:57.420 align:start position:0%
there's no pumping action taking place
 
05:51:59.448 --> 05:51:59.458 align:start position:0%
it's just uh cells twitching so you'd
 
05:52:01.730 --> 05:52:01.740 align:start position:0%
need an ultrasound
 
05:52:05.750 --> 05:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
anyone else uh representative Perez
 
05:52:09.530 --> 05:52:09.540 align:start position:0%
although I support this bill 100 because
 
05:52:11.810 --> 05:52:11.820 align:start position:0%
of being a nurse you did not pronounce
 
05:52:13.548 --> 05:52:13.558 align:start position:0%
someone dead
 
05:52:15.708 --> 05:52:15.718 align:start position:0%
until their heart stopped not when they
 
05:52:17.750 --> 05:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
were brain dead but they were not
 
05:52:19.490 --> 05:52:19.500 align:start position:0%
pronounced dead until their heart
 
05:52:21.410 --> 05:52:21.420 align:start position:0%
stopped so I and My Heart of Heart
 
05:52:24.470 --> 05:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
believes that life begins its perception
 
05:52:27.530 --> 05:52:27.540 align:start position:0%
conception I do not think we are at this
 
05:52:30.048 --> 05:52:30.058 align:start position:0%
point as well I don't think we can and I
 
05:52:32.530 --> 05:52:32.540 align:start position:0%
would love to see the 24 weeks come down
 
05:52:36.770 --> 05:52:36.780 align:start position:0%
because what babies are viable younger
 
05:52:39.410 --> 05:52:39.420 align:start position:0%
than that now and that's one of the
 
05:52:42.048 --> 05:52:42.058 align:start position:0%
reasons why I'm against any type of
 
05:52:42.058 --> 05:52:43.430 align:start position:0%
reasons why I'm against any type of
um

05:52:43.430 --> 05:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:52:45.830 --> 05:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
written in stone that we can't change
 
05:52:47.868 --> 05:52:47.878 align:start position:0%
that so
 
05:52:50.690 --> 05:52:50.700 align:start position:0%
um I will vote for it
 
05:52:54.890 --> 05:52:54.900 align:start position:0%
um because it I and but I do know my
 
05:52:56.750 --> 05:52:56.760 align:start position:0%
constituents do want to have the
 
05:52:59.470 --> 05:52:59.480 align:start position:0%
protection of the present fetal heart
 
05:53:02.208 --> 05:53:02.218 align:start position:0%
fetal protection act thank you anyone
 
05:53:03.590 --> 05:53:03.600 align:start position:0%
else wish to yes representative
 
05:53:03.600 --> 05:53:05.628 align:start position:0%
else wish to yes representative
Stapleton

05:53:05.628 --> 05:53:05.638 align:start position:0%
Stapleton
 
05:53:09.890 --> 05:53:09.900 align:start position:0%
I was the author of uh HB 629 the
 
05:53:12.830 --> 05:53:12.840 align:start position:0%
viability bill that I wrote on the basis
 
05:53:17.868 --> 05:53:17.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:19.850 --> 05:53:19.860 align:start position:0%
and I thought that that would be a
 
05:53:21.590 --> 05:53:21.600 align:start position:0%
middle ground
 
05:53:24.948 --> 05:53:24.958 align:start position:0%
even though that I'm a pro-life guy that
 
05:53:27.650 --> 05:53:27.660 align:start position:0%
believes that life is sacred from the
 
05:53:29.510 --> 05:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
moment of conception to the moment of
 
05:53:31.788 --> 05:53:31.798 align:start position:0%
natural death
 
05:53:35.270 --> 05:53:35.280 align:start position:0%
I understand that this is not the Bible
 
05:53:39.048 --> 05:53:39.058 align:start position:0%
Belt and there's no way that this bill
 
05:53:40.970 --> 05:53:40.980 align:start position:0%
is going to probably make it in the
 
05:53:43.310 --> 05:53:43.320 align:start position:0%
house or the Senate remember the
 
05:53:43.320 --> 05:53:45.110 align:start position:0%
house or the Senate remember the
governor

05:53:45.110 --> 05:53:45.120 align:start position:0%
governor
 
05:53:49.128 --> 05:53:49.138 align:start position:0%
however as a matter of personal belief
 
05:53:50.690 --> 05:53:50.700 align:start position:0%
and morality
 
05:53:52.730 --> 05:53:52.740 align:start position:0%
I have to vote for the bill because
 
05:53:55.430 --> 05:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
every life is sacred from the moment of
 
05:53:57.670 --> 05:53:57.680 align:start position:0%
conception that's what I believe
 
05:54:01.250 --> 05:54:01.260 align:start position:0%
subscribe to and I can't counter that
 
05:54:06.048 --> 05:54:06.058 align:start position:0%
with a vote against it I will vote OTP
 
05:54:10.190 --> 05:54:10.200 align:start position:0%
by any anyone else wish to speak on HB
 
05:54:10.200 --> 05:54:12.048 align:start position:0%
by any anyone else wish to speak on HB
591

05:54:12.048 --> 05:54:12.058 align:start position:0%
591

05:55:19.190 --> 05:55:19.200 align:start position:0%
sounds like there will not be a Minority
 
05:55:20.628 --> 05:55:20.638 align:start position:0%
Report or
 
05:55:21.708 --> 05:55:21.718 align:start position:0%
all right
 
05:55:21.718 --> 05:55:23.690 align:start position:0%
all right
um

05:55:23.690 --> 05:55:23.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:55:26.510 --> 05:55:26.520 align:start position:0%
all right I think we are through that
 
05:55:28.730 --> 05:55:28.740 align:start position:0%
difficult topic
 
05:55:30.410 --> 05:55:30.420 align:start position:0%
um so let's turn
 
05:55:33.288 --> 05:55:33.298 align:start position:0%
to something which
 
05:55:34.850 --> 05:55:34.860 align:start position:0%
sounds like it's going to be from what
 
05:55:36.350 --> 05:55:36.360 align:start position:0%
from the hearing this morning there will
 
05:55:39.288 --> 05:55:39.298 align:start position:0%
be equally uh an equally difficult topic
 
05:55:41.288 --> 05:55:41.298 align:start position:0%
but maybe
 
05:55:44.868 --> 05:55:44.878 align:start position:0%
oh two I'm sorry great yes
 
05:55:44.878 --> 05:55:49.010 align:start position:0%
oh two I'm sorry great yes
yes

05:55:49.010 --> 05:55:49.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:51.410 --> 05:55:51.420 align:start position:0%
all right um so let me turn to how it's
 
05:55:54.590 --> 05:55:54.600 align:start position:0%
Bill 261 authorizing residential tenants
 
05:55:56.030 --> 05:55:56.040 align:start position:0%
to terminate their lease and instances
 
05:55:57.770 --> 05:55:57.780 align:start position:0%
of domestic violence
 
05:55:59.930 --> 05:55:59.940 align:start position:0%
or following a disabling illness or
 
05:56:01.490 --> 05:56:01.500 align:start position:0%
accident the chair recognized
 
05:56:03.530 --> 05:56:03.540 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander for a motion um
 
05:56:05.090 --> 05:56:05.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I feel like we moved
 
05:56:06.890 --> 05:56:06.900 align:start position:0%
from one difficult topic to another when
 
05:56:08.750 --> 05:56:08.760 align:start position:0%
you're talking about housing
 
05:56:11.270 --> 05:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
um I I will move um and expedient to
 
05:56:13.970 --> 05:56:13.980 align:start position:0%
legislate on HP 261. all right is there
 
05:56:15.830 --> 05:56:15.840 align:start position:0%
a second
 
05:56:22.670 --> 05:56:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:24.708 --> 05:56:24.718 align:start position:0%
all right so there's been moved and
 
05:56:26.330 --> 05:56:26.340 align:start position:0%
seconded and representative Alexander do
 
05:56:28.010 --> 05:56:28.020 align:start position:0%
you wish to speak to your motion yeah I
 
05:56:29.930 --> 05:56:29.940 align:start position:0%
mean briefly um this is just another one
 
05:56:31.310 --> 05:56:31.320 align:start position:0%
of those bills that I feel like puts
 
05:56:32.990 --> 05:56:33.000 align:start position:0%
more infringement on
 
05:56:34.910 --> 05:56:34.920 align:start position:0%
um the rights of landlords
 
05:56:37.250 --> 05:56:37.260 align:start position:0%
um we all know that the housing crisis
 
05:56:39.110 --> 05:56:39.120 align:start position:0%
is a supply side issue so more
 
05:56:40.788 --> 05:56:40.798 align:start position:0%
regulation is going to exacerbate the
 
05:56:45.048 --> 05:56:45.058 align:start position:0%
problem I will say that it although I
 
05:56:48.410 --> 05:56:48.420 align:start position:0%
feel for victims of domestic violence
 
05:56:50.990 --> 05:56:51.000 align:start position:0%
um it's really not an issue of a
 
05:56:53.030 --> 05:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
landlord's issue the landlord's only
 
05:56:55.430 --> 05:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
issue is the property and maintaining
 
05:56:57.830 --> 05:56:57.840 align:start position:0%
the property for the tenants so my
 
05:57:00.048 --> 05:57:00.058 align:start position:0%
concern with this bill is that the onus
 
05:57:01.910 --> 05:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
of who holds the bag at the end of the
 
05:57:03.708 --> 05:57:03.718 align:start position:0%
day goes to the landlord when it's not
 
05:57:05.650 --> 05:57:05.660 align:start position:0%
really in the landlord's biggest
 
05:57:07.970 --> 05:57:07.980 align:start position:0%
landlord's issue um
 
05:57:10.070 --> 05:57:10.080 align:start position:0%
I also don't see it happening as
 
05:57:11.330 --> 05:57:11.340 align:start position:0%
frequent enough I don't think that there
 
05:57:13.368 --> 05:57:13.378 align:start position:0%
were a lot of examples that we heard or
 
05:57:15.288 --> 05:57:15.298 align:start position:0%
if any at the public hearing that this
 
05:57:18.170 --> 05:57:18.180 align:start position:0%
bill was absolutely necessary and then
 
05:57:19.430 --> 05:57:19.440 align:start position:0%
um I know there's a couple amendments
 
05:57:21.890 --> 05:57:21.900 align:start position:0%
floating around I I personally like
 
05:57:23.330 --> 05:57:23.340 align:start position:0%
don't think that any of those amendments
 
05:57:26.448 --> 05:57:26.458 align:start position:0%
will make me get to a yes on this bill
 
05:57:28.910 --> 05:57:28.920 align:start position:0%
um and then I just
 
05:57:30.770 --> 05:57:30.780 align:start position:0%
I had something else but I'm gonna leave
 
05:57:31.730 --> 05:57:31.740 align:start position:0%
it at that
 
05:57:34.730 --> 05:57:34.740 align:start position:0%
yes uh representative Greece thank you
 
05:57:35.810 --> 05:57:35.820 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
05:57:38.990 --> 05:57:39.000 align:start position:0%
uh attempting to work with a sponsor of
 
05:57:41.330 --> 05:57:41.340 align:start position:0%
this bill in crafting an amendment that
 
05:57:43.548 --> 05:57:43.558 align:start position:0%
might be able to uh bring representative
 
05:57:47.090 --> 05:57:47.100 align:start position:0%
Alexander to a yes uh and and failing to
 
05:57:49.788 --> 05:57:49.798 align:start position:0%
come up with said Amendment uh that even
 
05:57:51.650 --> 05:57:51.660 align:start position:0%
I could continue to say yes to I'm
 
05:57:53.510 --> 05:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
afraid that we just can't get to a point
 
05:57:55.070 --> 05:57:55.080 align:start position:0%
where we're not sandbagging the
 
05:57:58.430 --> 05:57:58.440 align:start position:0%
landlords that said I did speak with a
 
05:58:01.190 --> 05:58:01.200 align:start position:0%
couple of the landlords that testified
 
05:58:04.490 --> 05:58:04.500 align:start position:0%
and told them that they would it would
 
05:58:07.548 --> 05:58:07.558 align:start position:0%
behoove them uh be very beneficial for
 
05:58:11.448 --> 05:58:11.458 align:start position:0%
all all parties if they would be
 
05:58:14.448 --> 05:58:14.458 align:start position:0%
active in
 
05:58:18.548 --> 05:58:18.558 align:start position:0%
um identifying areas where landlords can
 
05:58:22.310 --> 05:58:22.320 align:start position:0%
uh take some action or work with
 
05:58:25.448 --> 05:58:25.458 align:start position:0%
legislators to to be able to address
 
05:58:29.270 --> 05:58:29.280 align:start position:0%
these issues that come up and they were
 
05:58:31.548 --> 05:58:31.558 align:start position:0%
certainly positive to taking a more
 
05:58:33.770 --> 05:58:33.780 align:start position:0%
proactive position working with tenants
 
05:58:36.170 --> 05:58:36.180 align:start position:0%
associations working with the landlords
 
05:58:39.350 --> 05:58:39.360 align:start position:0%
working with legislators so this bill is
 
05:58:40.368 --> 05:58:40.378 align:start position:0%
not going to get it none of the
 
05:58:41.390 --> 05:58:41.400 align:start position:0%
amendments are going to get where we
 
05:58:43.548 --> 05:58:43.558 align:start position:0%
need to go so I'm I I will support the
 
05:58:45.470 --> 05:58:45.480 align:start position:0%
itl motion just because we couldn't come
 
05:58:47.150 --> 05:58:47.160 align:start position:0%
up with a with a solution all right
 
05:58:48.948 --> 05:58:48.958 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to speak to House Bill
 
05:58:51.650 --> 05:58:51.660 align:start position:0%
261 yes representative thank you Mr
 
05:58:53.990 --> 05:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
chair um I wanted to ask representative
 
05:58:55.490 --> 05:58:55.500 align:start position:0%
Alexander if he would consider
 
05:58:57.230 --> 05:58:57.240 align:start position:0%
withdrawing his motion and doing a
 
05:58:59.090 --> 05:58:59.100 align:start position:0%
retain on this I know that there's the
 
05:59:01.128 --> 05:59:01.138 align:start position:0%
commission that you're involved in with
 
05:59:03.708 --> 05:59:03.718 align:start position:0%
landlord and you know tenant issues and
 
05:59:05.448 --> 05:59:05.458 align:start position:0%
you know if we
 
05:59:06.948 --> 05:59:06.958 align:start position:0%
take it to the floor these may be
 
05:59:08.510 --> 05:59:08.520 align:start position:0%
options that can't be considered by that
 
05:59:11.570 --> 05:59:11.580 align:start position:0%
so would it retain be something you and
 
05:59:13.010 --> 05:59:13.020 align:start position:0%
I appreciate the concern and there were
 
05:59:14.390 --> 05:59:14.400 align:start position:0%
there were actually a lot of there are
 
05:59:16.310 --> 05:59:16.320 align:start position:0%
some bills that have hit the floor that
 
05:59:17.330 --> 05:59:17.340 align:start position:0%
I have been interested in looking at
 
05:59:19.430 --> 05:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
that I wouldn't like to see itl but this
 
05:59:20.628 --> 05:59:20.638 align:start position:0%
is one of these issues that the
 
05:59:22.490 --> 05:59:22.500 align:start position:0%
committee isn't looking at further
 
05:59:24.288 --> 05:59:24.298 align:start position:0%
regulation we're looking at more at the
 
05:59:26.090 --> 05:59:26.100 align:start position:0%
supply side issue and if you look um
 
05:59:27.410 --> 05:59:27.420 align:start position:0%
back at the public hearing and the
 
05:59:28.788 --> 05:59:28.798 align:start position:0%
testimony that we got from some of the
 
05:59:30.350 --> 05:59:30.360 align:start position:0%
stakeholders in the housing and it's
 
05:59:31.730 --> 05:59:31.740 align:start position:0%
it's the whole Gambit right we're
 
05:59:33.230 --> 05:59:33.240 align:start position:0%
bringing in everybody else
 
05:59:34.610 --> 05:59:34.620 align:start position:0%
um we're really trying to steer the
 
05:59:37.490 --> 05:59:37.500 align:start position:0%
conversation not in a regulation
 
05:59:39.230 --> 05:59:39.240 align:start position:0%
perspective so
 
05:59:41.150 --> 05:59:41.160 align:start position:0%
um I don't see anything in this bill
 
05:59:44.150 --> 05:59:44.160 align:start position:0%
that you know I mean correct I'm one of
 
05:59:45.650 --> 05:59:45.660 align:start position:0%
10 people on the committee but there's
 
05:59:47.150 --> 05:59:47.160 align:start position:0%
also multiple people in this room that
 
05:59:48.708 --> 05:59:48.718 align:start position:0%
are on the committee and I personally
 
05:59:50.510 --> 05:59:50.520 align:start position:0%
don't see anything in this bill that the
 
05:59:51.890 --> 05:59:51.900 align:start position:0%
special committee could look into and
 
05:59:53.448 --> 05:59:53.458 align:start position:0%
possibly solve so
 
05:59:55.490 --> 05:59:55.500 align:start position:0%
um it's a good it's a good guess but a
 
05:59:57.708 --> 05:59:57.718 align:start position:0%
question but no I don't see it all right
 
06:00:00.410 --> 06:00:00.420 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to speak to uh House
 
06:00:02.208 --> 06:00:02.218 align:start position:0%
Bill 261
 
06:00:04.910 --> 06:00:04.920 align:start position:0%
but the motion on the floor is uh in
 
06:00:06.590 --> 06:00:06.600 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate and I'd ask the
 
06:00:09.708 --> 06:00:09.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:11.930 --> 06:00:11.940 align:start position:0%

06:01:02.628 --> 06:01:02.638 align:start position:0%
I remain in the majority to move to vote
 
06:01:05.390 --> 06:01:05.400 align:start position:0%
for a motion for reconsideration
 
06:01:07.128 --> 06:01:07.138 align:start position:0%
um so I'll just tell you that right up
 
06:01:12.070 --> 06:01:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:15.170 --> 06:01:15.180 align:start position:0%
oh you don't oh I'm sure well thank you
 
06:01:17.150 --> 06:01:17.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for that then yes and change
 
06:01:19.010 --> 06:01:19.020 align:start position:0%
that to a yes please
 
06:01:19.020 --> 06:01:22.330 align:start position:0%
that to a yes please
ah

06:01:22.330 --> 06:01:22.340 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:26.990 --> 06:01:27.000 align:start position:0%
okay so the motion fails nine to ten
 
06:01:27.000 --> 06:01:28.190 align:start position:0%
okay so the motion fails nine to ten
so

06:01:28.190 --> 06:01:28.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:01:28.200 --> 06:01:29.990 align:start position:0%
so
now

06:01:29.990 --> 06:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
now
 
06:01:35.930 --> 06:01:35.940 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:38.930 --> 06:01:38.940 align:start position:0%
no all right so
 
06:01:41.390 --> 06:01:41.400 align:start position:0%
um and I don't I I guess I'll I mean I
 
06:01:43.250 --> 06:01:43.260 align:start position:0%
just I guess I'd just be completely
 
06:01:45.708 --> 06:01:45.718 align:start position:0%
there's nothing more to say than I think
 
06:01:47.810 --> 06:01:47.820 align:start position:0%
that the reason the motion the reason
 
06:01:49.670 --> 06:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
the motion passed is we didn't have the
 
06:01:51.170 --> 06:01:51.180 align:start position:0%
full committee here we now do have the
 
06:01:54.470 --> 06:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
full committee here and so I'm uh I move
 
06:01:55.610 --> 06:01:55.620 align:start position:0%
for reconsideration I don't have
 
06:01:57.470 --> 06:01:57.480 align:start position:0%
anything else to say can we do it by
 
06:01:58.730 --> 06:01:58.740 align:start position:0%
hand voter
 
06:02:00.110 --> 06:02:00.120 align:start position:0%
I think we probably ought to have a
 
06:02:02.270 --> 06:02:02.280 align:start position:0%
rollercoaster you need a second on that
 
06:02:04.788 --> 06:02:04.798 align:start position:0%
yes could I have a second
 
06:02:07.368 --> 06:02:07.378 align:start position:0%
a while a second okay all right
 
06:02:11.570 --> 06:02:11.580 align:start position:0%
so uh all right so we're back to
 
06:02:11.580 --> 06:02:13.010 align:start position:0%
so uh all right so we're back to
um

06:02:13.010 --> 06:02:13.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:02:13.020 --> 06:02:14.410 align:start position:0%
um
uh

06:02:14.410 --> 06:02:14.420 align:start position:0%

for you know for this could for the same
 
06:05:01.310 --> 06:05:01.320 align:start position:0%
reason that that was mentioned by the
 
06:05:05.868 --> 06:05:05.878 align:start position:0%
former colleague I guess I I leave it up
 
06:05:07.850 --> 06:05:07.860 align:start position:0%
to my colleagues on the other side but
 
06:05:10.548 --> 06:05:10.558 align:start position:0%
if if you don't have an OTP does that
 
06:05:12.288 --> 06:05:12.298 align:start position:0%
present a problem for you I leave it to
 
06:05:15.470 --> 06:05:15.480 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman can offer a motion to
 
06:05:15.480 --> 06:05:16.368 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman can offer a motion to
retain

06:05:16.368 --> 06:05:16.378 align:start position:0%
retain
 
06:05:18.530 --> 06:05:18.540 align:start position:0%
this spill
 
06:05:21.288 --> 06:05:21.298 align:start position:0%
I'm sure yes you certainly can offer a
 
06:05:23.090 --> 06:05:23.100 align:start position:0%
motion to retain okay there there were
 
06:05:24.410 --> 06:05:24.420 align:start position:0%
two amendments
 
06:05:27.190 --> 06:05:27.200 align:start position:0%
um the the person who uh
 
06:05:30.590 --> 06:05:30.600 align:start position:0%
uh coordinated those is out ill
 
06:05:33.470 --> 06:05:33.480 align:start position:0%
um haven't had a full chance to debrief
 
06:05:35.150 --> 06:05:35.160 align:start position:0%
um I think there were honest efforts put
 
06:05:37.730 --> 06:05:37.740 align:start position:0%
forward I don't know that the remaining
 
06:05:40.070 --> 06:05:40.080 align:start position:0%
issues are are on
 
06:05:40.080 --> 06:05:42.170 align:start position:0%
issues are are on
um

06:05:42.170 --> 06:05:42.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:05:42.180 --> 06:05:46.990 align:start position:0%
um
irreconcilable

06:05:46.990 --> 06:05:47.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:48.708 --> 06:05:48.718 align:start position:0%
that's right
 
06:05:51.650 --> 06:05:51.660 align:start position:0%
a second so may I ask a question
 
06:05:54.410 --> 06:05:54.420 align:start position:0%
um representative yes because I mean
 
06:05:55.970 --> 06:05:55.980 align:start position:0%
this would have a
 
06:05:57.948 --> 06:05:57.958 align:start position:0%
along the lines of what representative
 
06:06:00.708 --> 06:06:00.718 align:start position:0%
Alexander suggested
 
06:06:04.250 --> 06:06:04.260 align:start position:0%
I had I had suggested an amendment which
 
06:06:07.250 --> 06:06:07.260 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm not sure how if it actually I
 
06:06:09.470 --> 06:06:09.480 align:start position:0%
think I circulated it at least to my car
 
06:06:10.970 --> 06:06:10.980 align:start position:0%
because I'm not sure I circulated to
 
06:06:13.788 --> 06:06:13.798 align:start position:0%
everybody I I may have though basically
 
06:06:19.190 --> 06:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
it it my proposed amendment would have
 
06:06:22.070 --> 06:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
done nothing with regard to the landlord
 
06:06:25.310 --> 06:06:25.320 align:start position:0%
tenant law but it would have said that
 
06:06:27.890 --> 06:06:27.900 align:start position:0%
it would have added a provision to RSA
 
06:06:30.350 --> 06:06:30.360 align:start position:0%
173b the domestic violence statute
 
06:06:34.310 --> 06:06:34.320 align:start position:0%
saying in the damages section that one
 
06:06:36.948 --> 06:06:36.958 align:start position:0%
of the things that a victim of domestic
 
06:06:39.770 --> 06:06:39.780 align:start position:0%
violence could recover from the abuser
 
06:06:44.750 --> 06:06:44.760 align:start position:0%
was any costs incurred by that victim as
 
06:06:48.230 --> 06:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
a result of of breaking a lease
 
06:06:49.788 --> 06:06:49.798 align:start position:0%
um in the way and the purpose of that
 
06:06:51.110 --> 06:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
basically along the lines of what
 
06:06:53.510 --> 06:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander said my basic
 
06:06:55.368 --> 06:06:55.378 align:start position:0%
problem with this whole bill is trying
 
06:06:57.470 --> 06:06:57.480 align:start position:0%
to when the where the landlord is not at
 
06:06:59.570 --> 06:06:59.580 align:start position:0%
fault putting some owners on the
 
06:07:01.910 --> 06:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
landlord my amendment was designed to
 
06:07:05.448 --> 06:07:05.458 align:start position:0%
say the onus belongs on the abuser and
 
06:07:09.410 --> 06:07:09.420 align:start position:0%
and you know so I I guess what I'm
 
06:07:11.570 --> 06:07:11.580 align:start position:0%
I'm just kind of wondering if and I
 
06:07:13.190 --> 06:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
really throw it out to
 
06:07:15.650 --> 06:07:15.660 align:start position:0%
everyone on the committee just
 
06:07:18.530 --> 06:07:18.540 align:start position:0%
are any of you sort of receptive to the
 
06:07:20.810 --> 06:07:20.820 align:start position:0%
idea that that might be an appropriate
 
06:07:20.820 --> 06:07:22.310 align:start position:0%
idea that that might be an appropriate
Amendment

06:07:22.310 --> 06:07:22.320 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
06:07:24.170 --> 06:07:24.180 align:start position:0%
um because I
 
06:07:26.868 --> 06:07:26.878 align:start position:0%
I if it is then you know then that's
 
06:07:29.330 --> 06:07:29.340 align:start position:0%
something I'm I I at least would
 
06:07:30.770 --> 06:07:30.780 align:start position:0%
speaking of myself would be willing to
 
06:07:33.230 --> 06:07:33.240 align:start position:0%
talk about but if it's if it's just
 
06:07:33.240 --> 06:07:34.610 align:start position:0%
talk about but if it's if it's just
another

06:07:34.610 --> 06:07:34.620 align:start position:0%
another
 
06:07:36.350 --> 06:07:36.360 align:start position:0%
you know if you're just thinking that
 
06:07:37.788 --> 06:07:37.798 align:start position:0%
we'll have another amendment that will
 
06:07:40.190 --> 06:07:40.200 align:start position:0%
sort of talk about
 
06:07:42.650 --> 06:07:42.660 align:start position:0%
what can we do the landlords I I would
 
06:07:45.288 --> 06:07:45.298 align:start position:0%
not be receptive to that person okay oh
 
06:07:45.298 --> 06:07:47.208 align:start position:0%
not be receptive to that person okay oh
sorry

06:07:47.208 --> 06:07:47.218 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
06:07:49.250 --> 06:07:49.260 align:start position:0%
I think uh thank you very much for
 
06:07:51.770 --> 06:07:51.780 align:start position:0%
raising that there are I know at least
 
06:07:53.750 --> 06:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
two other amendments that have been
 
06:07:53.760 --> 06:07:55.010 align:start position:0%
two other amendments that have been
prepared

06:07:55.010 --> 06:07:55.020 align:start position:0%
prepared
 
06:07:56.750 --> 06:07:56.760 align:start position:0%
um with names of members of the
 
06:08:00.288 --> 06:08:00.298 align:start position:0%
committee and I think this might be a
 
06:08:06.708 --> 06:08:06.718 align:start position:0%
good example of a bill that could um
 
06:08:09.948 --> 06:08:09.958 align:start position:0%
be improved by this committee and end up
 
06:08:12.170 --> 06:08:12.180 align:start position:0%
with something that balances the
 
06:08:15.650 --> 06:08:15.660 align:start position:0%
competing needs I mean I truthfully had
 
06:08:19.548 --> 06:08:19.558 align:start position:0%
problems with the combination of uh
 
06:08:22.970 --> 06:08:22.980 align:start position:0%
domestic violence on the one hand and
 
06:08:22.980 --> 06:08:23.810 align:start position:0%
domestic violence on the one hand and
then

06:08:23.810 --> 06:08:23.820 align:start position:0%
then
 
06:08:23.820 --> 06:08:24.650 align:start position:0%
then
um

06:08:24.650 --> 06:08:24.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:08:24.660 --> 06:08:26.208 align:start position:0%
um
uh

06:08:26.208 --> 06:08:26.218 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:08:30.708 --> 06:08:30.718 align:start position:0%
uh that yeah the disability on the other
 
06:08:33.410 --> 06:08:33.420 align:start position:0%
I thought it was it was conflating two
 
06:08:35.750 --> 06:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
very very different issues and very
 
06:08:35.760 --> 06:08:37.490 align:start position:0%
very very different issues and very
different

06:08:37.490 --> 06:08:37.500 align:start position:0%
different
 
06:08:39.948 --> 06:08:39.958 align:start position:0%
um effects and responsibilities of the
 
06:08:41.990 --> 06:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
landlord I think the point that you've
 
06:08:44.448 --> 06:08:44.458 align:start position:0%
just raised is a very interesting one
 
06:08:47.090 --> 06:08:47.100 align:start position:0%
one of the problems we always have with
 
06:08:49.368 --> 06:08:49.378 align:start position:0%
these landlord tenants is always it's
 
06:08:52.070 --> 06:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
either or it's either for the landlord
 
06:08:54.470 --> 06:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
or for the tenant and it's in the
 
06:08:57.170 --> 06:08:57.180 align:start position:0%
landlord's best interest to keep his
 
06:08:59.868 --> 06:08:59.878 align:start position:0%
property or her property full and have
 
06:09:02.510 --> 06:09:02.520 align:start position:0%
tenants who were paying and it's the
 
06:09:04.670 --> 06:09:04.680 align:start position:0%
tenant's best interest to have decent
 
06:09:07.610 --> 06:09:07.620 align:start position:0%
housing and why we can't
 
06:09:09.410 --> 06:09:09.420 align:start position:0%
thread the needle
 
06:09:12.650 --> 06:09:12.660 align:start position:0%
so everybody benefits I'm not sure but
 
06:09:14.390 --> 06:09:14.400 align:start position:0%
this might be a good example of one
 
06:09:16.250 --> 06:09:16.260 align:start position:0%
where we could improve the bill and I
 
06:09:18.490 --> 06:09:18.500 align:start position:0%
would certainly
 
06:09:22.430 --> 06:09:22.440 align:start position:0%
like to see your Amendment
 
06:09:25.128 --> 06:09:25.138 align:start position:0%
and I'll I'll just say since I made the
 
06:09:25.138 --> 06:09:26.270 align:start position:0%
and I'll I'll just say since I made the
motion

06:09:26.270 --> 06:09:26.280 align:start position:0%
motion
 
06:09:28.310 --> 06:09:28.320 align:start position:0%
um you know I think there's many many
 
06:09:30.890 --> 06:09:30.900 align:start position:0%
competing forces in this in this this
 
06:09:33.890 --> 06:09:33.900 align:start position:0%
bill in terms of goals some to protect
 
06:09:35.868 --> 06:09:35.878 align:start position:0%
the the
 
06:09:38.270 --> 06:09:38.280 align:start position:0%
um anonymity and whereabouts of a
 
06:09:40.490 --> 06:09:40.500 align:start position:0%
domestic violence fism sum is to provide
 
06:09:42.350 --> 06:09:42.360 align:start position:0%
resources for them to move or free them
 
06:09:44.270 --> 06:09:44.280 align:start position:0%
from joint tenant leases and other
 
06:09:45.350 --> 06:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
things and then there's the whole
 
06:09:46.850 --> 06:09:46.860 align:start position:0%
disability portion which I agree is
 
06:09:49.970 --> 06:09:49.980 align:start position:0%
quite separate that was my reason and I
 
06:09:52.490 --> 06:09:52.500 align:start position:0%
and I I think your your point is also
 
06:09:54.708 --> 06:09:54.718 align:start position:0%
well within the realm of what should be
 
06:09:57.170 --> 06:09:57.180 align:start position:0%
considered so can I can I may I just ask
 
06:09:59.270 --> 06:09:59.280 align:start position:0%
Alex representative Alexander then I
 
06:10:00.230 --> 06:10:00.240 align:start position:0%
want to definitely want to hear from you
 
06:10:02.090 --> 06:10:02.100 align:start position:0%
representative but representative
 
06:10:06.288 --> 06:10:06.298 align:start position:0%
Alexander if we were to retain this can
 
06:10:08.150 --> 06:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
you give us some
 
06:10:11.690 --> 06:10:11.700 align:start position:0%
sense of what what if any effect you
 
06:10:13.430 --> 06:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
think it would or would not have on the
 
06:10:14.990 --> 06:10:15.000 align:start position:0%
work that you and your committee is
 
06:10:15.000 --> 06:10:16.430 align:start position:0%
work that you and your committee is
doing

06:10:16.430 --> 06:10:16.440 align:start position:0%
doing
 
06:10:18.770 --> 06:10:18.780 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chair where we are
 
06:10:20.628 --> 06:10:20.638 align:start position:0%
specifically looking at loosening
 
06:10:23.288 --> 06:10:23.298 align:start position:0%
regulations around the housing crisis
 
06:10:25.670 --> 06:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
allowing you know maybe more dense
 
06:10:28.430 --> 06:10:28.440 align:start position:0%
density things like that we're not
 
06:10:30.350 --> 06:10:30.360 align:start position:0%
looking at like landlord-tenant issues
 
06:10:32.628 --> 06:10:32.638 align:start position:0%
so it would have no effect I will say
 
06:10:34.850 --> 06:10:34.860 align:start position:0%
again though that even if we retain it I
 
06:10:37.670 --> 06:10:37.680 align:start position:0%
don't see a final product that I could
 
06:10:39.048 --> 06:10:39.058 align:start position:0%
probably support
 
06:10:41.208 --> 06:10:41.218 align:start position:0%
um and you know I actually agree with
 
06:10:42.530 --> 06:10:42.540 align:start position:0%
believe it or not I agree with
 
06:10:43.850 --> 06:10:43.860 align:start position:0%
representative Smith and I have a
 
06:10:45.708 --> 06:10:45.718 align:start position:0%
problem with the disability and domestic
 
06:10:47.030 --> 06:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
violence in the same bill and all that
 
06:10:48.470 --> 06:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
stuff and I just don't think it's
 
06:10:50.150 --> 06:10:50.160 align:start position:0%
something that the committee
 
06:10:52.850 --> 06:10:52.860 align:start position:0%
could work on to get me to a yes so all
 
06:10:58.548 --> 06:10:58.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:00.948 --> 06:11:00.958 align:start position:0%
sorry I was wondering if um your
 
06:11:03.170 --> 06:11:03.180 align:start position:0%
amendment has anything to do with the
 
06:11:06.530 --> 06:11:06.540 align:start position:0%
victim Witness Protection Program
 
06:11:10.190 --> 06:11:10.200 align:start position:0%
it it does not it just it is simply it's
 
06:11:13.548 --> 06:11:13.558 align:start position:0%
simply an addition to the damages
 
06:11:16.070 --> 06:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
section of the domestic violence thing
 
06:11:17.750 --> 06:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
in other words a currently domestic
 
06:11:19.310 --> 06:11:19.320 align:start position:0%
violence thing says you can get damages
 
06:11:21.590 --> 06:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
for this that and the other thing and
 
06:11:23.628 --> 06:11:23.638 align:start position:0%
this would say this that and the other
 
06:11:27.110 --> 06:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
thing and damages for you know loss of
 
06:11:29.990 --> 06:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh for for having to break a lease or
 
06:11:31.730 --> 06:11:31.740 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
06:11:33.410 --> 06:11:33.420 align:start position:0%
um all right anyone else wish to be
 
06:11:34.970 --> 06:11:34.980 align:start position:0%
heard on the motion to retain yes
 
06:11:34.980 --> 06:11:38.810 align:start position:0%
heard on the motion to retain yes
representative

06:11:38.810 --> 06:11:38.820 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:41.868 --> 06:11:41.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:41.878 --> 06:11:43.850 align:start position:0%
 
the abuser

06:11:43.850 --> 06:11:43.860 align:start position:0%
the abuser
 
06:11:46.730 --> 06:11:46.740 align:start position:0%
is the abuser a husband
 
06:11:49.490 --> 06:11:49.500 align:start position:0%
a live-in partner
 
06:11:54.948 --> 06:11:54.958 align:start position:0%
or remote uh boyfriend or a stalker even
 
06:11:58.070 --> 06:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
um in trying to transfer
 
06:12:00.708 --> 06:12:00.718 align:start position:0%
the onus away from the landlord who's
 
06:12:03.170 --> 06:12:03.180 align:start position:0%
not responsible for the domestic abuse
 
06:12:06.230 --> 06:12:06.240 align:start position:0%
to another party
 
06:12:09.350 --> 06:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
and this bill I would almost think that
 
06:12:11.990 --> 06:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
that's not your main to the for the
 
06:12:13.570 --> 06:12:13.580 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill
 
06:12:16.070 --> 06:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
and the best of the reach you may be
 
06:12:17.868 --> 06:12:17.878 align:start position:0%
right you may you may be right I mean I
 
06:12:19.490 --> 06:12:19.500 align:start position:0%
didn't I did I had not I have not
 
06:12:21.288 --> 06:12:21.298 align:start position:0%
submitted the Amendments and so you know
 
06:12:23.690 --> 06:12:23.700 align:start position:0%
the clerk hasn't looked at it you may be
 
06:12:25.250 --> 06:12:25.260 align:start position:0%
right the clerk might say this is not
 
06:12:26.868 --> 06:12:26.878 align:start position:0%
Jermaine and he can't
 
06:12:30.170 --> 06:12:30.180 align:start position:0%
so on that I I would I would be opposed
 
06:12:32.990 --> 06:12:33.000 align:start position:0%
to the retain
 
06:12:34.670 --> 06:12:34.680 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to be heard on the
 
06:12:36.650 --> 06:12:36.660 align:start position:0%
motion to retain I really want to get
 
06:12:39.590 --> 06:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
out of here talk but I'm going to I
 
06:12:41.330 --> 06:12:41.340 align:start position:0%
would support that type of amendment
 
06:12:44.448 --> 06:12:44.458 align:start position:0%
because I I see the goal of the bill
 
06:12:48.110 --> 06:12:48.120 align:start position:0%
wasn't it was to protect the domestic
 
06:12:50.868 --> 06:12:50.878 align:start position:0%
violence victim so I don't know that the
 
06:12:53.030 --> 06:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
source was really you know I mean I
 
06:12:54.708 --> 06:12:54.718 align:start position:0%
think that's the type of you know good
 
06:12:56.570 --> 06:12:56.580 align:start position:0%
type of thought you know thought process
 
06:12:58.010 --> 06:12:58.020 align:start position:0%
or you know putting two heads together
 
06:13:00.530 --> 06:13:00.540 align:start position:0%
so that might then be able to separate
 
06:13:02.330 --> 06:13:02.340 align:start position:0%
the issues regarding disability and
 
06:13:04.250 --> 06:13:04.260 align:start position:0%
other I don't know I I support it and I
 
06:13:06.530 --> 06:13:06.540 align:start position:0%
I think it'd be worth looking into all
 
06:13:08.270 --> 06:13:08.280 align:start position:0%
right anyone else wish to be heard on
 
06:13:10.610 --> 06:13:10.620 align:start position:0%
the motion to retake
 
06:13:13.490 --> 06:13:13.500 align:start position:0%
all right so I
 
06:13:16.730 --> 06:13:16.740 align:start position:0%
I guess my
 
06:13:19.310 --> 06:13:19.320 align:start position:0%
as much as I would hope that's at some
 
06:13:21.048 --> 06:13:21.058 align:start position:0%
point in the future and maybe next time
 
06:13:23.150 --> 06:13:23.160 align:start position:0%
particularly if and you may be very well
 
06:13:24.890 --> 06:13:24.900 align:start position:0%
maybe right representative Turner that
 
06:13:27.288 --> 06:13:27.298 align:start position:0%
that the amendment I propose would would
 
06:13:29.390 --> 06:13:29.400 align:start position:0%
if the speaker had to rule on it would
 
06:13:31.548 --> 06:13:31.558 align:start position:0%
rule was not germane to this that might
 
06:13:32.628 --> 06:13:32.638 align:start position:0%
very well
 
06:13:35.208 --> 06:13:35.218 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry rapid Stapleton that might
 
06:13:36.948 --> 06:13:36.958 align:start position:0%
very well be correct
 
06:13:38.930 --> 06:13:38.940 align:start position:0%
um so I think I think in the end
 
06:13:41.030 --> 06:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
although I appreciate very much what
 
06:13:42.470 --> 06:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
everyone has said in support of
 
06:13:44.628 --> 06:13:44.638 align:start position:0%
retention I think I probably would come
 
06:13:47.990 --> 06:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
down against uh retaining the bill
 
06:13:50.090 --> 06:13:50.100 align:start position:0%
um so and with that anyone else have
 
06:13:52.430 --> 06:13:52.440 align:start position:0%
anything to to say all right so the
 
06:13:54.288 --> 06:13:54.298 align:start position:0%
motion before us is a motion to retain
 
06:13:56.690 --> 06:13:56.700 align:start position:0%
and I would ask the clerk to call the
 
06:13:56.700 --> 06:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
and I would ask the clerk to call the
rule

06:13:58.480 --> 06:13:58.490 align:start position:0%
rule
 
06:13:58.490 --> 06:13:59.750 align:start position:0%

recognize representative Wallace for a
 
06:29:37.740 --> 06:29:39.410 align:start position:0%
recognize representative Wallace for a
motion

06:29:39.410 --> 06:29:39.420 align:start position:0%
motion
 
06:29:41.770 --> 06:29:41.780 align:start position:0%
I would move to retain house bill
 
06:29:46.250 --> 06:29:46.260 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:47.868 --> 06:29:47.878 align:start position:0%
all right moved by representative
 
06:29:49.310 --> 06:29:49.320 align:start position:0%
Wallace seconded by representative Smith
 
06:29:51.048 --> 06:29:51.058 align:start position:0%
representative Wallace would you like to
 
06:29:52.548 --> 06:29:52.558 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion
 
06:29:55.490 --> 06:29:55.500 align:start position:0%
uh we'll I'll very briefly I move to
 
06:29:57.530 --> 06:29:57.540 align:start position:0%
retain this there is some merits to this
 
06:29:59.990 --> 06:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
bill that we uh certainly can fix over
 
06:30:02.448 --> 06:30:02.458 align:start position:0%
the summer so that's the intention we'll
 
06:30:04.430 --> 06:30:04.440 align:start position:0%
address this over the summer and improve
 
06:30:06.410 --> 06:30:06.420 align:start position:0%
it for the fall right anybody else wish
 
06:30:08.270 --> 06:30:08.280 align:start position:0%
to speak yes representative Perez yes I
 
06:30:12.410 --> 06:30:12.420 align:start position:0%
was given information about this by the
 
06:30:14.288 --> 06:30:14.298 align:start position:0%
representative that put the bill forward
 
06:30:17.570 --> 06:30:17.580 align:start position:0%
that actually in the Commonwealth of
 
06:30:20.650 --> 06:30:20.660 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts they do have a law
 
06:30:23.868 --> 06:30:23.878 align:start position:0%
that supports the one that we're trying
 
06:30:26.690 --> 06:30:26.700 align:start position:0%
to get and she has the full law I just
 
06:30:29.330 --> 06:30:29.340 align:start position:0%
printed out I think I printed out on all
 
06:30:30.650 --> 06:30:30.660 align:start position:0%
of it but
 
06:30:30.660 --> 06:30:31.250 align:start position:0%
of it but
um

06:30:31.250 --> 06:30:31.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:30:34.190 --> 06:30:34.200 align:start position:0%
so you know there is precedence for this
 
06:30:35.690 --> 06:30:35.700 align:start position:0%
type of the thing
 
06:30:37.128 --> 06:30:37.138 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to speak to
 
06:30:39.350 --> 06:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
representative uh Horrigan please
 
06:30:41.690 --> 06:30:41.700 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much we uh of course
 
06:30:43.190 --> 06:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
we're being asked to legislate by
 
06:30:46.128 --> 06:30:46.138 align:start position:0%
anecdote because of one experience she
 
06:30:47.628 --> 06:30:47.638 align:start position:0%
and a library trustee in their Town
 
06:30:50.030 --> 06:30:50.040 align:start position:0%
ahead and turned out not to go into to
 
06:30:52.610 --> 06:30:52.620 align:start position:0%
make details about it but the uh
 
06:30:54.470 --> 06:30:54.480 align:start position:0%
controversy in question was actually a
 
06:30:57.288 --> 06:30:57.298 align:start position:0%
meeting that probably both the library's
 
06:30:58.970 --> 06:30:58.980 align:start position:0%
trustee and the person the people the
 
06:31:00.650 --> 06:31:00.660 align:start position:0%
library trustee were concerned about
 
06:31:03.230 --> 06:31:03.240 align:start position:0%
both could have had their probably some
 
06:31:05.330 --> 06:31:05.340 align:start position:0%
extent did have their reputations
 
06:31:05.340 --> 06:31:06.350 align:start position:0%
extent did have their reputations
um

06:31:06.350 --> 06:31:06.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:31:09.110 --> 06:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
adversely affected by what's going on so
 
06:31:11.150 --> 06:31:11.160 align:start position:0%
the example of the given white this bill
 
06:31:13.548 --> 06:31:13.558 align:start position:0%
is needed was uh
 
06:31:16.788 --> 06:31:16.798 align:start position:0%
didn't somewhat uh didn't quite mean the
 
06:31:19.610 --> 06:31:19.620 align:start position:0%
same thing to me as it did as it did to
 
06:31:21.830 --> 06:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
the uh the prime sponsor but there may
 
06:31:23.448 --> 06:31:23.458 align:start position:0%
be but certainly there may be something
 
06:31:25.128 --> 06:31:25.138 align:start position:0%
we need to talk about in the summer so
 
06:31:25.138 --> 06:31:26.150 align:start position:0%
we need to talk about in the summer so
they're

06:31:26.150 --> 06:31:26.160 align:start position:0%
they're
 
06:31:28.910 --> 06:31:28.920 align:start position:0%
we probably have stumbled onto a topic
 
06:31:30.470 --> 06:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
of interest and something
 
06:31:32.448 --> 06:31:32.458 align:start position:0%
maybe should be done next year or
 
06:31:34.610 --> 06:31:34.620 align:start position:0%
something all right anyone else wish to
 
06:31:36.230 --> 06:31:36.240 align:start position:0%
uh representative Alexander um thank you
 
06:31:38.270 --> 06:31:38.280 align:start position:0%
Mr chair this is something I'm very
 
06:31:40.310 --> 06:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
interested in working on this summer so
 
06:31:41.628 --> 06:31:41.638 align:start position:0%
I hope that we can do that very
 
06:31:43.250 --> 06:31:43.260 align:start position:0%
important to a constituent in town thank
 
06:31:46.430 --> 06:31:46.440 align:start position:0%
you no I I agree I think that they're
 
06:31:49.730 --> 06:31:49.740 align:start position:0%
they're my my initial reaction at the
 
06:31:52.128 --> 06:31:52.138 align:start position:0%
beginning of the hearing what was I was
 
06:31:53.628 --> 06:31:53.638 align:start position:0%
very negative as you probably may have
 
06:31:57.170 --> 06:31:57.180 align:start position:0%
seen from my questions as I heard more I
 
06:31:58.850 --> 06:31:58.860 align:start position:0%
began to kind of come around and think
 
06:32:00.288 --> 06:32:00.298 align:start position:0%
that well maybe there is something that
 
06:32:02.750 --> 06:32:02.760 align:start position:0%
can be done here I think one of the one
 
06:32:05.990 --> 06:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
of the things that needs to be addressed
 
06:32:09.770 --> 06:32:09.780 align:start position:0%
is the is the scope of it right now in
 
06:32:11.690 --> 06:32:11.700 align:start position:0%
other words the the thing that really
 
06:32:14.150 --> 06:32:14.160 align:start position:0%
sort of concerns me is I I as I was
 
06:32:16.128 --> 06:32:16.138 align:start position:0%
talking to representative Smith about
 
06:32:19.610 --> 06:32:19.620 align:start position:0%
this what we were kind of kicking it
 
06:32:20.570 --> 06:32:20.580 align:start position:0%
around and one of the things that
 
06:32:22.670 --> 06:32:22.680 align:start position:0%
occurred to me is you know suppose I was
 
06:32:24.170 --> 06:32:24.180 align:start position:0%
trying to think of an example and I I'm
 
06:32:25.610 --> 06:32:25.620 align:start position:0%
not sure I have a better one than I gave
 
06:32:27.048 --> 06:32:27.058 align:start position:0%
her which I think she didn't think was
 
06:32:28.970 --> 06:32:28.980 align:start position:0%
very good and she probably she was
 
06:32:30.128 --> 06:32:30.138 align:start position:0%
probably right
 
06:32:32.810 --> 06:32:32.820 align:start position:0%
but you know suppose that I suppose the
 
06:32:37.610 --> 06:32:37.620 align:start position:0%
situation is this the there's a uh at a
 
06:32:40.730 --> 06:32:40.740 align:start position:0%
town meeting somebody proposes to put on
 
06:32:44.150 --> 06:32:44.160 align:start position:0%
the ballot uh resolution condemning
 
06:32:47.150 --> 06:32:47.160 align:start position:0%
Vladimir Putin and the Selectmen have
 
06:32:49.670 --> 06:32:49.680 align:start position:0%
one or have want to have a meeting to
 
06:32:51.048 --> 06:32:51.058 align:start position:0%
decide whether this is something that
 
06:32:52.910 --> 06:32:52.920 align:start position:0%
really appropriately goes on the ballot
 
06:32:55.490 --> 06:32:55.500 align:start position:0%
or not do and there may they may be
 
06:32:57.470 --> 06:32:57.480 align:start position:0%
saying some bad things about Vladimir
 
06:32:59.208 --> 06:32:59.218 align:start position:0%
Putin do they have to send him notice
 
06:33:01.368 --> 06:33:01.378 align:start position:0%
that he has somebody has to be there I
 
06:33:03.230 --> 06:33:03.240 align:start position:0%
would I would assume we might say well
 
06:33:06.288 --> 06:33:06.298 align:start position:0%
that might go a little too far but yet
 
06:33:10.070 --> 06:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
under the language of uh of the proposed
 
06:33:10.080 --> 06:33:11.570 align:start position:0%
under the language of uh of the proposed
bill

06:33:11.570 --> 06:33:11.580 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:33:14.570 --> 06:33:14.580 align:start position:0%
um arguably you'd say yes we do and I so
 
06:33:16.850 --> 06:33:16.860 align:start position:0%
maybe we are maybe just as an example
 
06:33:20.270 --> 06:33:20.280 align:start position:0%
maybe we want to say if you are if
 
06:33:22.430 --> 06:33:22.440 align:start position:0%
someone who is a citizen of the
 
06:33:24.110 --> 06:33:24.120 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction like in other words if it's
 
06:33:25.788 --> 06:33:25.798 align:start position:0%
a if it's the town of Londonderry let's
 
06:33:28.368 --> 06:33:28.378 align:start position:0%
say if if the if some board in
 
06:33:30.048 --> 06:33:30.058 align:start position:0%
Londonderry is going to be talking about
 
06:33:32.628 --> 06:33:32.638 align:start position:0%
a citizen of Londonderry then they have
 
06:33:34.850 --> 06:33:34.860 align:start position:0%
to give some notice or if it's the
 
06:33:37.368 --> 06:33:37.378 align:start position:0%
county maybe the county of Rockingham or
 
06:33:40.788 --> 06:33:40.798 align:start position:0%
whatever but that's my concern
 
06:33:43.850 --> 06:33:43.860 align:start position:0%
you need to add not only a citizen of
 
06:33:46.190 --> 06:33:46.200 align:start position:0%
say Londonderry or but you need to add
 
06:33:48.230 --> 06:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
an employee of Londonderry as well
 
06:33:51.770 --> 06:33:51.780 align:start position:0%
because we just had a horrendous
 
06:33:54.530 --> 06:33:54.540 align:start position:0%
thing happen in Londonderry so sure so
 
06:33:56.750 --> 06:33:56.760 align:start position:0%
no in other words I think I support the
 
06:33:58.610 --> 06:33:58.620 align:start position:0%
motion to retain just because it it
 
06:34:00.410 --> 06:34:00.420 align:start position:0%
sounds like we this is something that
 
06:34:02.350 --> 06:34:02.360 align:start position:0%
has some Merit but we need to work on
 
06:34:05.628 --> 06:34:05.638 align:start position:0%
the sort of the parameters of it so I'm
 
06:34:07.190 --> 06:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
I'm going to vote in support of the
 
06:34:09.110 --> 06:34:09.120 align:start position:0%
motion to retained
 
06:34:12.350 --> 06:34:12.360 align:start position:0%
um Mr uh Mr chair can I assume that
 
06:34:14.330 --> 06:34:14.340 align:start position:0%
because of Representative Alexander's
 
06:34:16.250 --> 06:34:16.260 align:start position:0%
enthusiasm he's volunteering to chair
 
06:34:18.048 --> 06:34:18.058 align:start position:0%
this upcoming
 
06:34:20.270 --> 06:34:20.280 align:start position:0%
I I think there's another what I sort of
 
06:34:22.070 --> 06:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
I think I heard that too good we're in
 
06:34:24.708 --> 06:34:24.718 align:start position:0%
agreement once again I will say there's
 
06:34:26.390 --> 06:34:26.400 align:start position:0%
another subcommittee on lead I also
 
06:34:27.890 --> 06:34:27.900 align:start position:0%
volunteered a chair so if somebody else
 
06:34:29.208 --> 06:34:29.218 align:start position:0%
wants a chair committee I'm definitely
 
06:34:32.030 --> 06:34:32.040 align:start position:0%
willing to spread the wealth there I'm
 
06:34:34.190 --> 06:34:34.200 align:start position:0%
happy to do it if oh all right I may
 
06:34:36.470 --> 06:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
regret it but um I'll do it so he
 
06:34:37.910 --> 06:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't all right with everything job
 
06:34:40.730 --> 06:34:40.740 align:start position:0%
we'll uh we'll we'll uh chair the
 
06:34:42.110 --> 06:34:42.120 align:start position:0%
subcommittee all right so are we ready
 
06:34:43.610 --> 06:34:43.620 align:start position:0%
anybody else have anything else to say
 
06:34:45.590 --> 06:34:45.600 align:start position:0%
on the motion yes representative church
 
06:34:47.990 --> 06:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
just just one more thing I I'm uncertain
 
06:34:50.448 --> 06:34:50.458 align:start position:0%
on the on the retain and mostly because
 
06:34:52.490 --> 06:34:52.500 align:start position:0%
when when I came away from that
 
06:34:55.730 --> 06:34:55.740 align:start position:0%
Committee hearing was that there's a lot
 
06:34:58.430 --> 06:34:58.440 align:start position:0%
of activity that happens with
 
06:35:01.070 --> 06:35:01.080 align:start position:0%
um behind closed in in closed hearings
 
06:35:03.590 --> 06:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
at the Town level that
 
06:35:05.510 --> 06:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
um never see the light of day and that
 
06:35:07.850 --> 06:35:07.860 align:start position:0%
that forcing the disclosure of just the
 
06:35:10.250 --> 06:35:10.260 align:start position:0%
mere discussion of somebody's
 
06:35:10.260 --> 06:35:12.288 align:start position:0%
mere discussion of somebody's
potential

06:35:12.288 --> 06:35:12.298 align:start position:0%
potential
 
06:35:12.298 --> 06:35:13.128 align:start position:0%
potential
um

06:35:13.128 --> 06:35:13.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:35:15.830 --> 06:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
you know misbehavior or whatever you
 
06:35:17.690 --> 06:35:17.700 align:start position:0%
might say and having to notice that
 
06:35:21.470 --> 06:35:21.480 align:start position:0%
would cause that initial process that
 
06:35:24.048 --> 06:35:24.058 align:start position:0%
that uh you know uh select boards and
 
06:35:26.690 --> 06:35:26.700 align:start position:0%
other things take uh out into the open
 
06:35:28.368 --> 06:35:28.378 align:start position:0%
in a way that is actually
 
06:35:31.010 --> 06:35:31.020 align:start position:0%
counterproductive to the reputation you
 
06:35:32.690 --> 06:35:32.700 align:start position:0%
know and protection of of the person
 
06:35:36.288 --> 06:35:36.298 align:start position:0%
being subject so uh that does that was
 
06:35:38.090 --> 06:35:38.100 align:start position:0%
my biggest concern coming away and I
 
06:35:39.708 --> 06:35:39.718 align:start position:0%
feel like I'm not sure that that that
 
06:35:42.530 --> 06:35:42.540 align:start position:0%
would be resolved through the retainer
 
06:35:43.970 --> 06:35:43.980 align:start position:0%
all right
 
06:35:46.910 --> 06:35:46.920 align:start position:0%
um no anyone else have any anything to
 
06:35:48.470 --> 06:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
say on it all right so the motion before
 
06:35:51.890 --> 06:35:51.900 align:start position:0%
us then is a motion to retain House Bill
 
06:35:55.250 --> 06:35:55.260 align:start position:0%

representative

06:36:39.770 --> 06:36:39.780 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:42.770 --> 06:36:42.780 align:start position:0%
she has graciously volunteered to lead
 
06:36:45.490 --> 06:36:45.500 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee that well
 
06:36:47.690 --> 06:36:47.700 align:start position:0%

Amendment

06:37:05.810 --> 06:37:05.820 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
06:37:05.820 --> 06:37:08.530 align:start position:0%
Amendment
uh

06:37:08.530 --> 06:37:08.540 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:37:11.930 --> 06:37:11.940 align:start position:0%
20230739 and ask if there is a second I
 
06:37:13.430 --> 06:37:13.440 align:start position:0%
would second that please all right
 
06:37:15.650 --> 06:37:15.660 align:start position:0%
motion's been made and seconded and I'm
 
06:37:18.590 --> 06:37:18.600 align:start position:0%
gonna actually ask uh representative uh
 
06:37:21.410 --> 06:37:21.420 align:start position:0%
Perez if she would speak to uh the
 
06:37:21.420 --> 06:37:23.750 align:start position:0%
Perez if she would speak to uh the
amendment

06:37:23.750 --> 06:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
06:37:26.270 --> 06:37:26.280 align:start position:0%
the original bill
 
06:37:29.628 --> 06:37:29.638 align:start position:0%
um when we had all the testimony I felt
 
06:37:32.690 --> 06:37:32.700 align:start position:0%
very strongly about this bill in favor
 
06:37:35.510 --> 06:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
of the bill at the time because I felt
 
06:37:37.970 --> 06:37:37.980 align:start position:0%
as though we needed we had so many
 
06:37:41.530 --> 06:37:41.540 align:start position:0%
people coming representing
 
06:37:44.690 --> 06:37:44.700 align:start position:0%
teachers and administrators and on and
 
06:37:46.610 --> 06:37:46.620 align:start position:0%
on and on and I mentioned at that time
 
06:37:49.730 --> 06:37:49.740 align:start position:0%
that we really had no one to represent
 
06:37:54.288 --> 06:37:54.298 align:start position:0%
the children and the parents and this
 
06:37:57.530 --> 06:37:57.540 align:start position:0%
might possibly equal the playing field
 
06:37:57.540 --> 06:37:59.448 align:start position:0%
might possibly equal the playing field
so

06:37:59.448 --> 06:37:59.458 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:38:01.610 --> 06:38:01.620 align:start position:0%
I initially was a little disappointed
 
06:38:04.368 --> 06:38:04.378 align:start position:0%
with the amendment but then after
 
06:38:06.410 --> 06:38:06.420 align:start position:0%
speaking to
 
06:38:09.288 --> 06:38:09.298 align:start position:0%
um people about it I now support it
 
06:38:09.298 --> 06:38:11.150 align:start position:0%
um people about it I now support it
because

06:38:11.150 --> 06:38:11.160 align:start position:0%
because
 
06:38:15.590 --> 06:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
um it at least will help because I know
 
06:38:18.230 --> 06:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
in my town there's a lot of information
 
06:38:21.048 --> 06:38:21.058 align:start position:0%
that is trying to be obtained about
 
06:38:25.250 --> 06:38:25.260 align:start position:0%
different things going on and the 91 A's
 
06:38:28.970 --> 06:38:28.980 align:start position:0%
are just not working so different things
 
06:38:32.708 --> 06:38:32.718 align:start position:0%
are trying to be filed with the
 
06:38:36.830 --> 06:38:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:39.110 --> 06:38:39.120 align:start position:0%
um teachers and administrators have big
 
06:38:41.990 --> 06:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
lawyers and big unions behind them the
 
06:38:45.170 --> 06:38:45.180 align:start position:0%
parents and the children do not so I
 
06:38:48.048 --> 06:38:48.058 align:start position:0%
think this too will help I was very
 
06:38:50.390 --> 06:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
impressed with the testimony today from
 
06:38:53.810 --> 06:38:53.820 align:start position:0%
the um investigator I actually spoke
 
06:38:55.910 --> 06:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
with him outside and a couple of things
 
06:38:59.208 --> 06:38:59.218 align:start position:0%
that were being said were misinterpreted
 
06:39:01.430 --> 06:39:01.440 align:start position:0%
being misinterpreted when he talked
 
06:39:03.650 --> 06:39:03.660 align:start position:0%
about one percent he was not talking
 
06:39:06.948 --> 06:39:06.958 align:start position:0%
about one percent of teachers he was
 
06:39:11.270 --> 06:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
talking about one percent of those
 
06:39:14.510 --> 06:39:14.520 align:start position:0%
um problems that were brought to the doe
 
06:39:17.270 --> 06:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
one percent of those not one percent of
 
06:39:19.730 --> 06:39:19.740 align:start position:0%
the whole teacher population the other
 
06:39:22.010 --> 06:39:22.020 align:start position:0%
thing that was brought up by one of the
 
06:39:24.890 --> 06:39:24.900 align:start position:0%
Union Representatives is that 91 A's
 
06:39:28.430 --> 06:39:28.440 align:start position:0%
would would help in this but that's he
 
06:39:30.470 --> 06:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
brought up that I that that is not
 
06:39:34.368 --> 06:39:34.378 align:start position:0%
really true because 91 A's cannot you
 
06:39:38.270 --> 06:39:38.280 align:start position:0%
cannot obtain Personnel files with 91a
 
06:39:41.570 --> 06:39:41.580 align:start position:0%
so I I really would like to see us move
 
06:39:44.090 --> 06:39:44.100 align:start position:0%
this forward so that playing field is
 
06:39:47.448 --> 06:39:47.458 align:start position:0%
equal and that the investigator can do
 
06:39:48.788 --> 06:39:48.798 align:start position:0%
his job
 
06:39:48.798 --> 06:39:50.390 align:start position:0%
his job
granted

06:39:50.390 --> 06:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
granted
 
06:39:52.548 --> 06:39:52.558 align:start position:0%
it may only be one
 
06:39:56.030 --> 06:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
but you need to if it's only one you
 
06:39:58.250 --> 06:39:58.260 align:start position:0%
still need to protect the child from
 
06:40:01.250 --> 06:40:01.260 align:start position:0%
that one thank you
 
06:40:05.208 --> 06:40:05.218 align:start position:0%
um anyone else wish to speak to 533
 
06:40:08.270 --> 06:40:08.280 align:start position:0%
yes representative page yeah um I don't
 
06:40:09.048 --> 06:40:09.058 align:start position:0%
know if this is going to be the
 
06:40:11.510 --> 06:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate time but I'll speak against
 
06:40:14.150 --> 06:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
just it might be the appropriate time to
 
06:40:17.030 --> 06:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
discuss it now in terms of what um my
 
06:40:19.548 --> 06:40:19.558 align:start position:0%
concerns with the amendment and the
 
06:40:23.448 --> 06:40:23.458 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:26.990 --> 06:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
we had a colleague last term who
 
06:40:27.000 --> 06:40:28.430 align:start position:0%
we had a colleague last term who
frequently

06:40:28.430 --> 06:40:28.440 align:start position:0%
frequently
 
06:40:28.440 --> 06:40:29.150 align:start position:0%
frequently
um

06:40:29.150 --> 06:40:29.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:40:31.190 --> 06:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
talked about a constituent who gave him
 
06:40:32.990 --> 06:40:33.000 align:start position:0%
some good advice and it was his plumber
 
06:40:36.230 --> 06:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
named Stan and he said when you go to
 
06:40:37.788 --> 06:40:37.798 align:start position:0%
Concord don't do anything that's
 
06:40:40.128 --> 06:40:40.138 align:start position:0%
unnecessary anything you don't have to
 
06:40:40.138 --> 06:40:41.390 align:start position:0%
unnecessary anything you don't have to
do

06:40:41.390 --> 06:40:41.400 align:start position:0%
do
 
06:40:43.850 --> 06:40:43.860 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm worried that that's what we're
 
06:40:47.030 --> 06:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
doing here that we are giving excessive
 
06:40:49.788 --> 06:40:49.798 align:start position:0%
power to the administrative state
 
06:40:52.128 --> 06:40:52.138 align:start position:0%
and that concerns me from for a couple
 
06:40:55.730 --> 06:40:55.740 align:start position:0%
of reasons um I don't believe that this
 
06:40:58.070 --> 06:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
is necessary
 
06:41:03.470 --> 06:41:03.480 align:start position:0%
we we had we started with HB 533 and
 
06:41:07.010 --> 06:41:07.020 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that the DOA doe and the
 
06:41:08.750 --> 06:41:08.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice are
 
06:41:10.910 --> 06:41:10.920 align:start position:0%
working something out that problem has
 
06:41:14.270 --> 06:41:14.280 align:start position:0%
been solved and now I'm worried that
 
06:41:16.430 --> 06:41:16.440 align:start position:0%
with this amendment we're concentrating
 
06:41:17.810 --> 06:41:17.820 align:start position:0%
power in
 
06:41:20.330 --> 06:41:20.340 align:start position:0%
essentially one investigator with no
 
06:41:23.208 --> 06:41:23.218 align:start position:0%
guard rails on that um
 
06:41:26.330 --> 06:41:26.340 align:start position:0%
and he's has the authority
 
06:41:28.430 --> 06:41:28.440 align:start position:0%
to investigate
 
06:41:30.110 --> 06:41:30.120 align:start position:0%
for example
 
06:41:30.120 --> 06:41:30.708 align:start position:0%
for example
um

06:41:30.708 --> 06:41:30.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:41:32.448 --> 06:41:32.458 align:start position:0%
conduct prohibited under the banned
 
06:41:34.010 --> 06:41:34.020 align:start position:0%
Concepts bill which is
 
06:41:36.948 --> 06:41:36.958 align:start position:0%
courts have held that's a vague loss so
 
06:41:39.770 --> 06:41:39.780 align:start position:0%
it concerns me that we might have that
 
06:41:41.990 --> 06:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
much power concentrated through the
 
06:41:43.610 --> 06:41:43.620 align:start position:0%
subpoena power with one person
 
06:41:45.288 --> 06:41:45.298 align:start position:0%
interpreting a law that's incredibly
 
06:41:48.288 --> 06:41:48.298 align:start position:0%
vague in terms of being able to subpoena
 
06:41:50.810 --> 06:41:50.820 align:start position:0%
this as we mentioned there were some
 
06:41:52.548 --> 06:41:52.558 align:start position:0%
other things about not being in the
 
06:41:54.410 --> 06:41:54.420 align:start position:0%
guardrail of a usual subpoena issue the
 
06:41:55.788 --> 06:41:55.798 align:start position:0%
amendment does talk about carrying out
 
06:41:57.830 --> 06:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
an investigation now so let me change
 
06:41:57.840 --> 06:41:59.090 align:start position:0%
an investigation now so let me change
that

06:41:59.090 --> 06:41:59.100 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:42:00.650 --> 06:42:00.660 align:start position:0%
um but you know the other point to
 
06:42:03.530 --> 06:42:03.540 align:start position:0%
Stan's rule is the investigator said he
 
06:42:06.830 --> 06:42:06.840 align:start position:0%
was having success he was able to solve
 
06:42:07.970 --> 06:42:07.980 align:start position:0%
the problems
 
06:42:10.490 --> 06:42:10.500 align:start position:0%
through his you know gumshoe detective
 
06:42:11.628 --> 06:42:11.638 align:start position:0%
work I guess
 
06:42:14.150 --> 06:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
um he he mentioned that he was worried
 
06:42:15.948 --> 06:42:15.958 align:start position:0%
about a problem that he saw I believe
 
06:42:17.810 --> 06:42:17.820 align:start position:0%
down the road
 
06:42:20.570 --> 06:42:20.580 align:start position:0%
um the other thing that sort of two
 
06:42:21.890 --> 06:42:21.900 align:start position:0%
other things and I'll shut up because
 
06:42:23.510 --> 06:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
it's late but
 
06:42:25.910 --> 06:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
um is is the timing of this the
 
06:42:27.770 --> 06:42:27.780 align:start position:0%
investigator we had here said he'd been
 
06:42:27.780 --> 06:42:28.730 align:start position:0%
investigator we had here said he'd been
asking

06:42:28.730 --> 06:42:28.740 align:start position:0%
asking
 
06:42:31.850 --> 06:42:31.860 align:start position:0%
for 10 years for subpoena power
 
06:42:35.030 --> 06:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
in 2018 we had the education educator
 
06:42:36.708 --> 06:42:36.718 align:start position:0%
code of conduct
 
06:42:39.708 --> 06:42:39.718 align:start position:0%
and in 2023 this is the first time
 
06:42:42.530 --> 06:42:42.540 align:start position:0%
according to the doe lawyer that they
 
06:42:44.810 --> 06:42:44.820 align:start position:0%
have asked this legislator legislature
 
06:42:47.270 --> 06:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
for subpoena power
 
06:42:50.750 --> 06:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
it just it seems weird in my my view in
 
06:42:51.948 --> 06:42:51.958 align:start position:0%
the timing you know if it was that
 
06:42:54.830 --> 06:42:54.840 align:start position:0%
pressing of a problem you know why the
 
06:42:54.840 --> 06:42:55.910 align:start position:0%
pressing of a problem you know why the
delay

06:42:55.910 --> 06:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
delay
 
06:43:00.590 --> 06:43:00.600 align:start position:0%
and and the context while I know
 
06:43:02.030 --> 06:43:02.040 align:start position:0%
we were told at the beginning of the
 
06:43:03.948 --> 06:43:03.958 align:start position:0%
hearing it's it's not political and and
 
06:43:05.570 --> 06:43:05.580 align:start position:0%
this is not a political comic but the
 
06:43:07.250 --> 06:43:07.260 align:start position:0%
context I think was brought to bear in
 
06:43:08.570 --> 06:43:08.580 align:start position:0%
terms of
 
06:43:10.788 --> 06:43:10.798 align:start position:0%
the teacher who testified
 
06:43:14.510 --> 06:43:14.520 align:start position:0%
um about the former teacher about how
 
06:43:16.190 --> 06:43:16.200 align:start position:0%
educators are operating now the
 
06:43:18.708 --> 06:43:18.718 align:start position:0%
pressures that they feel the fears that
 
06:43:20.208 --> 06:43:20.218 align:start position:0%
they have
 
06:43:23.470 --> 06:43:23.480 align:start position:0%
um whatever those motivations are or not
 
06:43:26.510 --> 06:43:26.520 align:start position:0%
I'm not speculating but they're they are
 
06:43:29.690 --> 06:43:29.700 align:start position:0%
real and so I do worry in addition to
 
06:43:29.700 --> 06:43:30.470 align:start position:0%
real and so I do worry in addition to
that

06:43:30.470 --> 06:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:43:33.650 --> 06:43:33.660 align:start position:0%
we're adding fuel to that sort of
 
06:43:33.660 --> 06:43:34.910 align:start position:0%
we're adding fuel to that sort of
context

06:43:34.910 --> 06:43:34.920 align:start position:0%
context
 
06:43:37.430 --> 06:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
um but but I do the biggest
 
06:43:39.890 --> 06:43:39.900 align:start position:0%
issue I I have is concentrating that
 
06:43:41.810 --> 06:43:41.820 align:start position:0%
amount of administrative power where no
 
06:43:43.548 --> 06:43:43.558 align:start position:0%
other state does this
 
06:43:46.730 --> 06:43:46.740 align:start position:0%
in one investigator who us has oversight
 
06:43:49.548 --> 06:43:49.558 align:start position:0%
over a vague law
 
06:43:50.990 --> 06:43:51.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:43:52.970 --> 06:43:52.980 align:start position:0%
anyone else uh yes representative De
 
06:43:55.430 --> 06:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
Lorenzo thank you Mr Claire um you know
 
06:43:58.910 --> 06:43:58.920 align:start position:0%
my overall impression of the bill and
 
06:44:00.590 --> 06:44:00.600 align:start position:0%
today's hearing
 
06:44:02.628 --> 06:44:02.638 align:start position:0%
I was somewhat
 
06:44:02.638 --> 06:44:03.730 align:start position:0%
I was somewhat
um

06:44:03.730 --> 06:44:03.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:44:03.740 --> 06:44:05.270 align:start position:0%
um
concerned

06:44:05.270 --> 06:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
concerned
 
06:44:08.930 --> 06:44:08.940 align:start position:0%
because it felt like
 
06:44:12.470 --> 06:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
the investigator was running the entire
 
06:44:12.480 --> 06:44:13.448 align:start position:0%
the investigator was running the entire
department

06:44:13.448 --> 06:44:13.458 align:start position:0%
department
 
06:44:17.930 --> 06:44:17.940 align:start position:0%
and I don't believe that that's the case
 
06:44:17.940 --> 06:44:18.708 align:start position:0%
and I don't believe that that's the case
um

06:44:18.708 --> 06:44:18.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:44:21.590 --> 06:44:21.600 align:start position:0%
and so I felt that
 
06:44:26.208 --> 06:44:26.218 align:start position:0%
HB 533 is kind of a tentacle of the
 
06:44:28.670 --> 06:44:28.680 align:start position:0%
divisive concept you are in the budget
 
06:44:32.570 --> 06:44:32.580 align:start position:0%
trailer hb2 and
 
06:44:35.270 --> 06:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
I was concerned that
 
06:44:38.208 --> 06:44:38.218 align:start position:0%
the amendment charges the New Hampshire
 
06:44:40.490 --> 06:44:40.500 align:start position:0%
Human Rights Commission as a state
 
06:44:43.128 --> 06:44:43.138 align:start position:0%
agency with authority over these cases
 
06:44:45.708 --> 06:44:45.718 align:start position:0%
over the complaints and we know that the
 
06:44:48.590 --> 06:44:48.600 align:start position:0%
Human Rights Commission has bottlenecks
 
06:44:50.448 --> 06:44:50.458 align:start position:0%
in their case management
 
06:44:52.670 --> 06:44:52.680 align:start position:0%
the most recent update on cases on the
 
06:44:57.410 --> 06:44:57.420 align:start position:0%
atrc website is 2018. there is no data
 
06:44:59.470 --> 06:44:59.480 align:start position:0%
for a
 
06:45:03.170 --> 06:45:03.180 align:start position:0%
2019-2022 so I don't even know what the
 
06:45:04.788 --> 06:45:04.798 align:start position:0%
capacity is for the Human Rights
 
06:45:06.250 --> 06:45:06.260 align:start position:0%
Commission to
 
06:45:09.590 --> 06:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
hear these bills
 
06:45:09.600 --> 06:45:11.930 align:start position:0%
hear these bills
now

06:45:11.930 --> 06:45:11.940 align:start position:0%
now
 
06:45:17.150 --> 06:45:17.160 align:start position:0%
I think I also recognize that
 
06:45:21.590 --> 06:45:21.600 align:start position:0%
the commissioner uh Mr Edo blue
 
06:45:21.600 --> 06:45:22.128 align:start position:0%
the commissioner uh Mr Edo blue
um

06:45:22.128 --> 06:45:22.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:45:24.350 --> 06:45:24.360 align:start position:0%
he wrote an op-ed
 
06:45:25.788 --> 06:45:25.798 align:start position:0%
in April
 
06:45:25.798 --> 06:45:27.650 align:start position:0%
in April
and

06:45:27.650 --> 06:45:27.660 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:45:29.628 --> 06:45:29.638 align:start position:0%
he wrote about
 
06:45:31.730 --> 06:45:31.740 align:start position:0%
a 70 page
 
06:45:34.310 --> 06:45:34.320 align:start position:0%
um parcel of
 
06:45:38.570 --> 06:45:38.580 align:start position:0%
material from parents and Educators that
 
06:45:40.010 --> 06:45:40.020 align:start position:0%
he felt
 
06:45:44.208 --> 06:45:44.218 align:start position:0%
was objectionable and
 
06:45:46.070 --> 06:45:46.080 align:start position:0%
and possibly
 
06:45:48.770 --> 06:45:48.780 align:start position:0%
um in violation of the um divisive
 
06:45:50.390 --> 06:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
Concepts Act
 
06:45:54.650 --> 06:45:54.660 align:start position:0%
so when the folks who introduced
 
06:45:56.750 --> 06:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
um the bill from the
 
06:45:58.610 --> 06:45:58.620 align:start position:0%
Department of Education the ones that
 
06:46:00.708 --> 06:46:00.718 align:start position:0%
gave testimony they said it wasn't about
 
06:46:02.868 --> 06:46:02.878 align:start position:0%
the commissioner out of blue but I I
 
06:46:06.170 --> 06:46:06.180 align:start position:0%
think it is uh the fact that you know he
 
06:46:09.830 --> 06:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
has been a pop in public
 
06:46:12.708 --> 06:46:12.718 align:start position:0%
um he has released information about the
 
06:46:16.368 --> 06:46:16.378 align:start position:0%
70 pieces of um 70 pages of information
 
06:46:20.868 --> 06:46:20.878 align:start position:0%
uh given to him by parents and
 
06:46:22.390 --> 06:46:22.400 align:start position:0%
um students
 
06:46:24.770 --> 06:46:24.780 align:start position:0%
and he
 
06:46:26.390 --> 06:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
the commissioner
 
06:46:29.390 --> 06:46:29.400 align:start position:0%
because he had those 70 pieces of
 
06:46:32.650 --> 06:46:32.660 align:start position:0%
information felt that the department
 
06:46:35.448 --> 06:46:35.458 align:start position:0%
deserved to have subpoena power thank
 
06:46:35.458 --> 06:46:36.708 align:start position:0%
deserved to have subpoena power thank
you

06:46:36.708 --> 06:46:36.718 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:46:38.930 --> 06:46:38.940 align:start position:0%
anyone else uh yes representative
 
06:46:38.940 --> 06:46:41.270 align:start position:0%
anyone else uh yes representative
Stapleton

06:46:41.270 --> 06:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
Stapleton
 
06:46:43.730 --> 06:46:43.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um
 
06:46:47.030 --> 06:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative page for your
 
06:46:48.468 --> 06:46:48.478 align:start position:0%
comments and I
 
06:46:50.948 --> 06:46:50.958 align:start position:0%
picked up on the 10 years
 
06:46:53.750 --> 06:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
asking for The subpoena power that's an
 
06:46:53.760 --> 06:46:55.310 align:start position:0%
asking for The subpoena power that's an
interesting

06:46:55.310 --> 06:46:55.320 align:start position:0%
interesting
 
06:46:57.530 --> 06:46:57.540 align:start position:0%
fact um
 
06:46:59.090 --> 06:46:59.100 align:start position:0%
two things
 
06:47:02.330 --> 06:47:02.340 align:start position:0%
it takes a long time to pass bills here
 
06:47:05.868 --> 06:47:05.878 align:start position:0%
many terms many years
 
06:47:08.650 --> 06:47:08.660 align:start position:0%
I've had one of mine that's lingering
 
06:47:10.968 --> 06:47:10.978 align:start position:0%
going on the third term and I know
 
06:47:13.128 --> 06:47:13.138 align:start position:0%
there's other folks that have had
 
06:47:16.310 --> 06:47:16.320 align:start position:0%
multiple terms beyond that to get bills
 
06:47:16.320 --> 06:47:17.770 align:start position:0%
multiple terms beyond that to get bills
passed

06:47:17.770 --> 06:47:17.780 align:start position:0%
passed
 
06:47:19.788 --> 06:47:19.798 align:start position:0%
good bills
 
06:47:19.798 --> 06:47:20.750 align:start position:0%
good bills
um

06:47:20.750 --> 06:47:20.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:47:24.170 --> 06:47:24.180 align:start position:0%
even good Bills take a long time
 
06:47:24.180 --> 06:47:25.910 align:start position:0%
even good Bills take a long time
and

06:47:25.910 --> 06:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:47:27.830 --> 06:47:27.840 align:start position:0%
far as
 
06:47:30.890 --> 06:47:30.900 align:start position:0%
the the Human Rights Commission goes if
 
06:47:32.868 --> 06:47:32.878 align:start position:0%
they've got a severe backlog how can
 
06:47:34.368 --> 06:47:34.378 align:start position:0%
they investigate
 
06:47:36.708 --> 06:47:36.718 align:start position:0%
I would think that
 
06:47:39.788 --> 06:47:39.798 align:start position:0%
subpoena power would be enabling
 
06:47:42.490 --> 06:47:42.500 align:start position:0%
to get information
 
06:47:45.350 --> 06:47:45.360 align:start position:0%
so that we can determine the truth of
 
06:47:46.788 --> 06:47:46.798 align:start position:0%
the matter
 
06:47:48.948 --> 06:47:48.958 align:start position:0%
and and to get into the truth might
 
06:47:50.650 --> 06:47:50.660 align:start position:0%
actually be
 
06:47:55.310 --> 06:47:55.320 align:start position:0%
exculpatory as well as accusatory
 
06:47:57.468 --> 06:47:57.478 align:start position:0%
so um
 
06:48:01.490 --> 06:48:01.500 align:start position:0%
I think that if they've been looking for
 
06:48:04.368 --> 06:48:04.378 align:start position:0%
that power for 10 years it's not linked
 
06:48:04.378 --> 06:48:05.448 align:start position:0%
that power for 10 years it's not linked
directly

06:48:05.448 --> 06:48:05.458 align:start position:0%
directly
 
06:48:09.830 --> 06:48:09.840 align:start position:0%
to the divisive Concepts just happens to
 
06:48:12.170 --> 06:48:12.180 align:start position:0%
fall in a timing sense that they both
 
06:48:15.708 --> 06:48:15.718 align:start position:0%
come together in the same term year
 
06:48:15.718 --> 06:48:17.270 align:start position:0%
come together in the same term year
um

06:48:17.270 --> 06:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:48:20.150 --> 06:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
I heard the investigators say that
 
06:48:21.590 --> 06:48:21.600 align:start position:0%
they've been able to get information
 
06:48:24.170 --> 06:48:24.180 align:start position:0%
with a lot of work and but it's getting
 
06:48:24.180 --> 06:48:25.250 align:start position:0%
with a lot of work and but it's getting
tougher

06:48:25.250 --> 06:48:25.260 align:start position:0%
tougher
 
06:48:28.070 --> 06:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
and it could be under a political
 
06:48:31.548 --> 06:48:31.558 align:start position:0%
environment and such a divisive issue as
 
06:48:33.530 --> 06:48:33.540 align:start position:0%
the divorce of Concepts law that we
 
06:48:35.750 --> 06:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
could run into obfuscation
 
06:48:38.868 --> 06:48:38.878 align:start position:0%
and hindrance in getting information
 
06:48:42.110 --> 06:48:42.120 align:start position:0%
so I would see that value of subpoena
 
06:48:46.310 --> 06:48:46.320 align:start position:0%
even greater now than otherwise and so I
 
06:48:49.070 --> 06:48:49.080 align:start position:0%
would support the otpa
 
06:48:51.708 --> 06:48:51.718 align:start position:0%
representative yes
 
06:48:54.770 --> 06:48:54.780 align:start position:0%
uh sure go ahead
 
06:48:57.708 --> 06:48:57.718 align:start position:0%
with all due respect uh representative
 
06:49:01.690 --> 06:49:01.700 align:start position:0%
Stapleton you might have missed heard
 
06:49:05.150 --> 06:49:05.160 align:start position:0%
what representative page said the 10
 
06:49:07.430 --> 06:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
years referred to the amount of time
 
06:49:11.030 --> 06:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
that the investigator has been here but
 
06:49:15.048 --> 06:49:15.058 align:start position:0%
the um the Department's Council said
 
06:49:19.730 --> 06:49:19.740 align:start position:0%
this is the first time that they have
 
06:49:22.490 --> 06:49:22.500 align:start position:0%
asked for subpoena power they have not
 
06:49:25.730 --> 06:49:25.740 align:start position:0%
asked for subpoena power before nor
 
06:49:28.128 --> 06:49:28.138 align:start position:0%
would they have to since the Department
 
06:49:29.948 --> 06:49:29.958 align:start position:0%
of Justice
 
06:49:34.510 --> 06:49:34.520 align:start position:0%
has subpoena power and provides legal
 
06:49:37.910 --> 06:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
counsel to them so
 
06:49:40.368 --> 06:49:40.378 align:start position:0%
um it would be uh
 
06:49:42.830 --> 06:49:42.840 align:start position:0%
Superfluous for them to have had the
 
06:49:46.310 --> 06:49:46.320 align:start position:0%
need for subpoena power so
 
06:49:48.948 --> 06:49:48.958 align:start position:0%
the 10 years referred to the amount of
 
06:49:51.368 --> 06:49:51.378 align:start position:0%
time that the investigator
 
06:49:54.368 --> 06:49:54.378 align:start position:0%
investigator has been here
 
06:49:59.330 --> 06:49:59.340 align:start position:0%
my again I I look at this and
 
06:50:03.708 --> 06:50:03.718 align:start position:0%
I wonder why there are no limits
 
06:50:07.670 --> 06:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
established at all in terms of when in
 
06:50:09.250 --> 06:50:09.260 align:start position:0%
any process
 
06:50:13.310 --> 06:50:13.320 align:start position:0%
a subpoena is issued is it issued after
 
06:50:16.070 --> 06:50:16.080 align:start position:0%
any preliminary investigation or is it
 
06:50:20.030 --> 06:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
at the beginning as an attempt to um
 
06:50:20.040 --> 06:50:22.128 align:start position:0%
at the beginning as an attempt to um
uh

06:50:22.128 --> 06:50:22.138 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:50:25.368 --> 06:50:25.378 align:start position:0%
I don't know what the technical term
 
06:50:27.590 --> 06:50:27.600 align:start position:0%
would be for it but to kind of look
 
06:50:29.270 --> 06:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
around and see if we can find some
 
06:50:29.280 --> 06:50:30.890 align:start position:0%
around and see if we can find some
problems

06:50:30.890 --> 06:50:30.900 align:start position:0%
problems
 
06:50:34.490 --> 06:50:34.500 align:start position:0%
um who is subject to a subpoena is it
 
06:50:39.048 --> 06:50:39.058 align:start position:0%
only those people who are in fact uh
 
06:50:42.890 --> 06:50:42.900 align:start position:0%
covered under the code of responsibility
 
06:50:44.530 --> 06:50:44.540 align:start position:0%
in the department
 
06:50:48.548 --> 06:50:48.558 align:start position:0%
what about parents what about children
 
06:50:53.448 --> 06:50:53.458 align:start position:0%
none of that is is established and
 
06:50:53.458 --> 06:50:54.368 align:start position:0%
none of that is is established and
um

06:50:54.368 --> 06:50:54.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:50:58.490 --> 06:50:58.500 align:start position:0%
uh in in the language it is uh very much
 
06:51:01.730 --> 06:51:01.740 align:start position:0%
of a free-for-all and
 
06:51:01.740 --> 06:51:03.468 align:start position:0%
of a free-for-all and
um

06:51:03.468 --> 06:51:03.478 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:51:03.478 --> 06:51:05.868 align:start position:0%
um
I

06:51:05.868 --> 06:51:05.878 align:start position:0%
I
 
06:51:09.650 --> 06:51:09.660 align:start position:0%
I can't imagine that we as legislators
 
06:51:13.788 --> 06:51:13.798 align:start position:0%
want to support an effort to just say oh
 
06:51:15.948 --> 06:51:15.958 align:start position:0%
sure okay subpoena power what does it
 
06:51:17.990 --> 06:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
mean because to me and I would imagine
 
06:51:20.810 --> 06:51:20.820 align:start position:0%
to each of us subpoena power is really
 
06:51:23.750 --> 06:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
something pretty significant and there
 
06:51:26.030 --> 06:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
ought to be guidelines there ought to be
 
06:51:27.730 --> 06:51:27.740 align:start position:0%
ground rules there ought to be
 
06:51:30.410 --> 06:51:30.420 align:start position:0%
limitations and there ought to be a
 
06:51:33.230 --> 06:51:33.240 align:start position:0%
clear demonstration that there's a need
 
06:51:35.570 --> 06:51:35.580 align:start position:0%
for the subpoena power and if there is
 
06:51:37.430 --> 06:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
fine they get it and they could get it
 
06:51:39.048 --> 06:51:39.058 align:start position:0%
from the attorney general
 
06:51:41.208 --> 06:51:41.218 align:start position:0%
in no time they couldn't get it from the
 
06:51:42.890 --> 06:51:42.900 align:start position:0%
human relations Commission in no time
 
06:51:44.390 --> 06:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
because the human relations commission
 
06:51:47.150 --> 06:51:47.160 align:start position:0%
can't do anything in no time
 
06:51:48.410 --> 06:51:48.420 align:start position:0%
um but they could from the attorney
 
06:51:50.628 --> 06:51:50.638 align:start position:0%
general and um
 
06:51:50.638 --> 06:51:53.090 align:start position:0%
general and um
uh

06:51:53.090 --> 06:51:53.100 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:51:55.448 --> 06:51:55.458 align:start position:0%
I'm really
 
06:51:58.490 --> 06:51:58.500 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable in any Department without
 
06:51:58.500 --> 06:52:00.170 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable in any Department without
regard

06:52:00.170 --> 06:52:00.180 align:start position:0%
regard
 
06:52:03.230 --> 06:52:03.240 align:start position:0%
to who the Commissioners I would be
 
06:52:05.448 --> 06:52:05.458 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable with the liquor department
 
06:52:07.190 --> 06:52:07.200 align:start position:0%
I would be uncomfortable with the
 
06:52:09.048 --> 06:52:09.058 align:start position:0%
transportation department I would be
 
06:52:10.310 --> 06:52:10.320 align:start position:0%
comfortable with the Department of
 
06:52:13.010 --> 06:52:13.020 align:start position:0%
administrative services having subpoena
 
06:52:15.770 --> 06:52:15.780 align:start position:0%
power that isn't Limited in any way
 
06:52:19.430 --> 06:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
because I care about privacy and I care
 
06:52:22.490 --> 06:52:22.500 align:start position:0%
about due process and I don't think this
 
06:52:24.708 --> 06:52:24.718 align:start position:0%
language supports either of those thank
 
06:52:27.230 --> 06:52:27.240 align:start position:0%
you representative Turner
 
06:52:30.590 --> 06:52:30.600 align:start position:0%
yeah thanks Mr chair so I have three I
 
06:52:31.788 --> 06:52:31.798 align:start position:0%
went into this sort of with an open mind
 
06:52:33.410 --> 06:52:33.420 align:start position:0%
this morning but I came away with sort
 
06:52:34.910 --> 06:52:34.920 align:start position:0%
of three what I think are fairly strong
 
06:52:37.850 --> 06:52:37.860 align:start position:0%
reasons that I opposed this
 
06:52:40.430 --> 06:52:40.440 align:start position:0%
um the first and again stop me because I
 
06:52:42.110 --> 06:52:42.120 align:start position:0%
know this may not be within my purview
 
06:52:45.350 --> 06:52:45.360 align:start position:0%
you know is the question of a is it
 
06:52:49.190 --> 06:52:49.200 align:start position:0%
germane to the original Bill and B does
 
06:52:51.110 --> 06:52:51.120 align:start position:0%
it belong in this committee I know both
 
06:52:52.548 --> 06:52:52.558 align:start position:0%
of those things are probably out of my
 
06:52:55.788 --> 06:52:55.798 align:start position:0%
you know scope but but I will say the
 
06:52:57.468 --> 06:52:57.478 align:start position:0%
original Bill spoke specifically about
 
06:52:59.570 --> 06:52:59.580 align:start position:0%
human rights violations
 
06:53:01.368 --> 06:53:01.378 align:start position:0%
and bringing things to the Human Rights
 
06:53:03.590 --> 06:53:03.600 align:start position:0%
Commission whether the department of Ed
 
06:53:05.810 --> 06:53:05.820 align:start position:0%
could do that on behalf of others
 
06:53:09.048 --> 06:53:09.058 align:start position:0%
the testimony we heard today basically
 
06:53:12.170 --> 06:53:12.180 align:start position:0%
talked about almost everything but the
 
06:53:13.910 --> 06:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
human right they sort of it seemed like
 
06:53:15.410 --> 06:53:15.420 align:start position:0%
people were trying to go around the
 
06:53:17.868 --> 06:53:17.878 align:start position:0%
concept of of you know the the divisive
 
06:53:20.750 --> 06:53:20.760 align:start position:0%
concerts and human rights violations
 
06:53:22.430 --> 06:53:22.440 align:start position:0%
um to say this is about safety or it's
 
06:53:24.530 --> 06:53:24.540 align:start position:0%
about buses or you know and they clearly
 
06:53:27.048 --> 06:53:27.058 align:start position:0%
said it's in the entire code of conduct
 
06:53:29.150 --> 06:53:29.160 align:start position:0%
is what's falling in so it's way wider
 
06:53:31.548 --> 06:53:31.558 align:start position:0%
than the original bill so again I don't
 
06:53:33.530 --> 06:53:33.540 align:start position:0%
know if I'm allowed to make that point
 
06:53:36.350 --> 06:53:36.360 align:start position:0%
but it feels like this doesn't really
 
06:53:38.510 --> 06:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
belong it I am assuming that bill was
 
06:53:40.368 --> 06:53:40.378 align:start position:0%
before us because it was a Human Rights
 
06:53:43.430 --> 06:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
Commission sort of Bill and this feels
 
06:53:44.690 --> 06:53:44.700 align:start position:0%
very much like something that the
 
06:53:46.610 --> 06:53:46.620 align:start position:0%
department of educate or the education
 
06:53:49.128 --> 06:53:49.138 align:start position:0%
committee uh committee on education
 
06:53:51.890 --> 06:53:51.900 align:start position:0%
should should hear and then overall the
 
06:53:53.990 --> 06:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
question of
 
06:53:55.670 --> 06:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
um so that was the first place basically
 
06:53:57.350 --> 06:53:57.360 align:start position:0%
Jermaine and right for this committee
 
06:53:59.570 --> 06:53:59.580 align:start position:0%
second uh echoing a lot of things that
 
06:54:01.430 --> 06:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
we heard about limitations and process
 
06:54:03.530 --> 06:54:03.540 align:start position:0%
it feels like this would better be done
 
06:54:05.208 --> 06:54:05.218 align:start position:0%
as a bill
 
06:54:07.670 --> 06:54:07.680 align:start position:0%
put together and most likely assigned to
 
06:54:10.610 --> 06:54:10.620 align:start position:0%
the committee on education you know
 
06:54:13.490 --> 06:54:13.500 align:start position:0%
which would build out theoretically all
 
06:54:15.410 --> 06:54:15.420 align:start position:0%
of those things that
 
06:54:17.510 --> 06:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
um the licensing boards have around
 
06:54:19.850 --> 06:54:19.860 align:start position:0%
their subpoena power like a process and
 
06:54:22.010 --> 06:54:22.020 align:start position:0%
limitations and what time in the
 
06:54:23.990 --> 06:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
investigation can you make issue a
 
06:54:25.730 --> 06:54:25.740 align:start position:0%
subpoena whereas this seemed totally
 
06:54:27.230 --> 06:54:27.240 align:start position:0%
open-ended that was number three and
 
06:54:28.910 --> 06:54:28.920 align:start position:0%
then the Third
 
06:54:30.948 --> 06:54:30.958 align:start position:0%
was and this was something we heard in
 
06:54:32.570 --> 06:54:32.580 align:start position:0%
our original testimony on the first bill
 
06:54:34.968 --> 06:54:34.978 align:start position:0%
is that the Attorney General's office
 
06:54:38.868 --> 06:54:38.878 align:start position:0%
can already do this on behalf of the
 
06:54:42.048 --> 06:54:42.058 align:start position:0%
um the Department of Education
 
06:54:43.628 --> 06:54:43.638 align:start position:0%
um that was for
 
06:54:46.310 --> 06:54:46.320 align:start position:0%
bringing a complaint to begin with this
 
06:54:48.770 --> 06:54:48.780 align:start position:0%
is now about issuing a subpoena but we
 
06:54:51.468 --> 06:54:51.478 align:start position:0%
heard again today that the AG's office
 
06:54:53.930 --> 06:54:53.940 align:start position:0%
has the power to do this and that the
 
06:54:55.490 --> 06:54:55.500 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
06:54:55.500 --> 06:54:57.288 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
Services

06:54:57.288 --> 06:54:57.298 align:start position:0%
Services
 
06:54:59.150 --> 06:54:59.160 align:start position:0%
um when if they need to subpoena someone
 
06:55:01.128 --> 06:55:01.138 align:start position:0%
goes through that channel and that seems
 
06:55:02.750 --> 06:55:02.760 align:start position:0%
more appropriate so for those three
 
06:55:06.530 --> 06:55:06.540 align:start position:0%
reasons I think that that this is really
 
06:55:08.690 --> 06:55:08.700 align:start position:0%
not the right right place or the right
 
06:55:10.750 --> 06:55:10.760 align:start position:0%
scope to be doing this as an amendment
 
06:55:12.770 --> 06:55:12.780 align:start position:0%
representative staple
 
06:55:14.868 --> 06:55:14.878 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
06:55:17.628 --> 06:55:17.638 align:start position:0%
representative Smith for the clarifying
 
06:55:17.638 --> 06:55:18.770 align:start position:0%
representative Smith for the clarifying
information

06:55:18.770 --> 06:55:18.780 align:start position:0%
information
 
06:55:21.288 --> 06:55:21.298 align:start position:0%
I stand corrected and I thank you very
 
06:55:23.330 --> 06:55:23.340 align:start position:0%
much and I apologize for the
 
06:55:23.340 --> 06:55:25.430 align:start position:0%
much and I apologize for the
misunderstanding

06:55:25.430 --> 06:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding
 
06:55:29.390 --> 06:55:29.400 align:start position:0%
um beyond that my question was
 
06:55:32.448 --> 06:55:32.458 align:start position:0%
who issues The subpoena who approves it
 
06:55:35.390 --> 06:55:35.400 align:start position:0%
and representative trurer just related
 
06:55:38.570 --> 06:55:38.580 align:start position:0%
that the AG's office has that capability
 
06:55:42.048 --> 06:55:42.058 align:start position:0%
does a court also have the capability as
 
06:55:44.868 --> 06:55:44.878 align:start position:0%
well as the AG and either one we're
 
06:55:47.868 --> 06:55:47.878 align:start position:0%
going to rely on established Protocols
 
06:55:47.878 --> 06:55:49.968 align:start position:0%
going to rely on established Protocols
of

06:55:49.968 --> 06:55:49.978 align:start position:0%
of
 
06:55:53.390 --> 06:55:53.400 align:start position:0%
um of process and how to issue or if to
 
06:55:55.910 --> 06:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
issue these things uh whether it's a
 
06:55:58.910 --> 06:55:58.920 align:start position:0%
preponderance of evidence or a probable
 
06:55:58.920 --> 06:56:00.110 align:start position:0%
preponderance of evidence or a probable
cause

06:56:00.110 --> 06:56:00.120 align:start position:0%
cause
 
06:56:02.930 --> 06:56:02.940 align:start position:0%
um and maybe these sort of technical
 
06:56:04.850 --> 06:56:04.860 align:start position:0%
aspects are already covered under
 
06:56:07.190 --> 06:56:07.200 align:start position:0%
existing law and procedure that's a
 
06:56:07.200 --> 06:56:08.208 align:start position:0%
existing law and procedure that's a
question

06:56:08.208 --> 06:56:08.218 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:56:12.770 --> 06:56:12.780 align:start position:0%
so um so let me let me speak to that
 
06:56:15.048 --> 06:56:15.058 align:start position:0%
first of all let me just address the
 
06:56:17.810 --> 06:56:17.820 align:start position:0%
issue that you raised representative
 
06:56:17.820 --> 06:56:19.788 align:start position:0%
issue that you raised representative
uh

06:56:19.788 --> 06:56:19.798 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:56:22.310 --> 06:56:22.320 align:start position:0%
the point you raise I I I you know I
 
06:56:24.170 --> 06:56:24.180 align:start position:0%
there's they certainly are not frivolous
 
06:56:25.610 --> 06:56:25.620 align:start position:0%
points the points that you raise about
 
06:56:27.708 --> 06:56:27.718 align:start position:0%
the about the germanous issue I guess
 
06:56:29.570 --> 06:56:29.580 align:start position:0%
what I would say to that is
 
06:56:32.510 --> 06:56:32.520 align:start position:0%
both the clerk and the speaker
 
06:56:34.730 --> 06:56:34.740 align:start position:0%
looked at the question of whether this
 
06:56:37.010 --> 06:56:37.020 align:start position:0%
was Jermaine or not and they came to the
 
06:56:39.770 --> 06:56:39.780 align:start position:0%
conclusion as related to me
 
06:56:42.770 --> 06:56:42.780 align:start position:0%
yes it's Jermaine so that so that it's
 
06:56:44.330 --> 06:56:44.340 align:start position:0%
within the jurisdiction of this
 
06:56:47.448 --> 06:56:47.458 align:start position:0%
committee to hear it but it's different
 
06:56:49.368 --> 06:56:49.378 align:start position:0%
enough from the original bill that you
 
06:56:50.570 --> 06:56:50.580 align:start position:0%
should have a separate hearing which is
 
06:56:51.948 --> 06:56:51.958 align:start position:0%
the reason we had this separate hearing
 
06:56:54.110 --> 06:56:54.120 align:start position:0%
this morning so I I guess what I would
 
06:56:56.390 --> 06:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
say that determination has kind of been
 
06:56:58.968 --> 06:56:58.978 align:start position:0%
made above my pay grade yeah and I
 
06:57:02.570 --> 06:57:02.580 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that as well so so that um
 
06:57:05.150 --> 06:57:05.160 align:start position:0%
but but the second point I would make is
 
06:57:07.490 --> 06:57:07.500 align:start position:0%
with regard to uh representative
 
06:57:09.410 --> 06:57:09.420 align:start position:0%
stapleton's point is is this I think
 
06:57:11.628 --> 06:57:11.638 align:start position:0%
it's really important
 
06:57:13.430 --> 06:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
that everyone understand the way
 
06:57:16.128 --> 06:57:16.138 align:start position:0%
subpoenas work first of all in terms of
 
06:57:18.590 --> 06:57:18.600 align:start position:0%
are there limitations on this on the
 
06:57:20.570 --> 06:57:20.580 align:start position:0%
Commissioners if it's the commissioner
 
06:57:22.548 --> 06:57:22.558 align:start position:0%
not some investigator the commissioner
 
06:57:24.288 --> 06:57:24.298 align:start position:0%
that has the authority to issue subpenas
 
06:57:25.788 --> 06:57:25.798 align:start position:0%
now he may delegate that I'm not
 
06:57:28.128 --> 06:57:28.138 align:start position:0%
suggesting he can't delegate it but it's
 
06:57:29.570 --> 06:57:29.580 align:start position:0%
the commissioner that has the authority
 
06:57:32.270 --> 06:57:32.280 align:start position:0%
and it the the amendment says a
 
06:57:33.468 --> 06:57:33.478 align:start position:0%
commissioner is authorized to issue
 
06:57:36.170 --> 06:57:36.180 align:start position:0%
subpoenas for persons relevant documents
 
06:57:38.690 --> 06:57:38.700 align:start position:0%
and relevant items relevant bear in mind
 
06:57:41.270 --> 06:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
relevant that's one limitation whenever
 
06:57:44.208 --> 06:57:44.218 align:start position:0%
the commissioner has reason to believe
 
06:57:46.190 --> 06:57:46.200 align:start position:0%
that a violation of the code of conduct
 
06:57:48.948 --> 06:57:48.958 align:start position:0%
for educators has occurred so it has to
 
06:57:50.930 --> 06:57:50.940 align:start position:0%
be relevant documents or relevant
 
06:57:50.940 --> 06:57:52.070 align:start position:0%
be relevant documents or relevant
information

06:57:52.070 --> 06:57:52.080 align:start position:0%
information
 
06:57:54.410 --> 06:57:54.420 align:start position:0%
when there is reason to believe and so
 
06:57:56.030 --> 06:57:56.040 align:start position:0%
now the question comes up well is that
 
06:57:57.468 --> 06:57:57.478 align:start position:0%
does that have any meaning or can the
 
06:57:58.910 --> 06:57:58.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner just go out and do what he
 
06:58:01.910 --> 06:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
wants and the answer to that is yes it
 
06:58:04.250 --> 06:58:04.260 align:start position:0%
has meaning because
 
06:58:06.708 --> 06:58:06.718 align:start position:0%
neither The subpoena power that is great
 
06:58:08.448 --> 06:58:08.458 align:start position:0%
that would be granted under this bill
 
06:58:11.330 --> 06:58:11.340 align:start position:0%
nor any subpoena power whether it's the
 
06:58:13.730 --> 06:58:13.740 align:start position:0%
attorney general or any or the oplc or
 
06:58:17.448 --> 06:58:17.458 align:start position:0%
any agency or or
 
06:58:20.270 --> 06:58:20.280 align:start position:0%
um or even a court or I'm sorry a
 
06:58:22.610 --> 06:58:22.620 align:start position:0%
litigant in court they may be able to
 
06:58:24.890 --> 06:58:24.900 align:start position:0%
issue subpoenas but those subpoenas are
 
06:58:28.670 --> 06:58:28.680 align:start position:0%
not self-enforcing so if somebody if you
 
06:58:30.590 --> 06:58:30.600 align:start position:0%
you get a subpoena
 
06:58:33.230 --> 06:58:33.240 align:start position:0%
you can you can basically tell the
 
06:58:34.850 --> 06:58:34.860 align:start position:0%
person that gave you the subpoena that
 
06:58:36.830 --> 06:58:36.840 align:start position:0%
that's very nice I'm gonna move I'm
 
06:58:39.048 --> 06:58:39.058 align:start position:0%
gonna move to quash The subpoena in
 
06:58:41.510 --> 06:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
court I'm I'm not going to comply with
 
06:58:43.910 --> 06:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
that subpoena and the only way to have
 
06:58:46.730 --> 06:58:46.740 align:start position:0%
it enforced is for the Department of
 
06:58:48.230 --> 06:58:48.240 align:start position:0%
Education in this case or the Attorney
 
06:58:51.170 --> 06:58:51.180 align:start position:0%
General to go to court and get a court
 
06:58:55.128 --> 06:58:55.138 align:start position:0%
order saying you Mr respondent who has
 
06:58:57.048 --> 06:58:57.058 align:start position:0%
been subpoenaed you will
 
06:58:59.810 --> 06:58:59.820 align:start position:0%
you will comply with the subpoena or
 
06:59:01.070 --> 06:59:01.080 align:start position:0%
you'll be held in contact that's
 
06:59:03.288 --> 06:59:03.298 align:start position:0%
basically what they're saying or if it
 
06:59:05.510 --> 06:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
turns out that the subpoena that that
 
06:59:07.430 --> 06:59:07.440 align:start position:0%
the court finds there was no reasonable
 
06:59:09.770 --> 06:59:09.780 align:start position:0%
basis to issue The subpoena or The
 
06:59:11.990 --> 06:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
subpoena is over broad or the evidence
 
06:59:13.850 --> 06:59:13.860 align:start position:0%
that's asked for is not relevant the
 
06:59:16.368 --> 06:59:16.378 align:start position:0%
court will then quash The subpoena in
 
06:59:19.070 --> 06:59:19.080 align:start position:0%
whole or in part so it's really
 
06:59:20.990 --> 06:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
important to understand that
 
06:59:25.010 --> 06:59:25.020 align:start position:0%
the the way when you when the when a
 
06:59:27.410 --> 06:59:27.420 align:start position:0%
subpoena is issued that doesn't mean
 
06:59:29.810 --> 06:59:29.820 align:start position:0%
that the Department of Education or for
 
06:59:31.548 --> 06:59:31.558 align:start position:0%
lack of a better term people with guns
 
06:59:34.070 --> 06:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
are coming out to somebody's to the
 
06:59:36.468 --> 06:59:36.478 align:start position:0%
subpoenaed party's place and say
 
06:59:38.810 --> 06:59:38.820 align:start position:0%
you're giving me this stuff right now or
 
06:59:40.968 --> 06:59:40.978 align:start position:0%
you're coming with me right now that
 
06:59:43.190 --> 06:59:43.200 align:start position:0%
does that's not what a you know subpoena
 
06:59:44.810 --> 06:59:44.820 align:start position:0%
is not a search warrant or an arrest
 
06:59:47.270 --> 06:59:47.280 align:start position:0%
warrant it simply says
 
06:59:50.628 --> 06:59:50.638 align:start position:0%
you provide this information
 
06:59:53.150 --> 06:59:53.160 align:start position:0%
and if you object to providing the
 
06:59:55.910 --> 06:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
information you make move to quash The
 
06:59:58.910 --> 06:59:58.920 align:start position:0%
subpoena in court and only the court can
 
07:00:01.490 --> 07:00:01.500 align:start position:0%
order that it be provided on penalty of
 
07:00:03.110 --> 07:00:03.120 align:start position:0%
if you don't do it then the court could
 
07:00:06.468 --> 07:00:06.478 align:start position:0%
hold you in contempt so anyway that's uh
 
07:00:10.670 --> 07:00:10.680 align:start position:0%
yeah but yes representative mcbeath
 
07:00:13.448 --> 07:00:13.458 align:start position:0%
so just to follow what we're saying
 
07:00:17.208 --> 07:00:17.218 align:start position:0%
I was so concerned I have hit this from
 
07:00:20.270 --> 07:00:20.280 align:start position:0%
our rights are privately okay we in the
 
07:00:22.190 --> 07:00:22.200 align:start position:0%
answer we just passed the prostitution
 
07:00:24.010 --> 07:00:24.020 align:start position:0%
of London of course
 
07:00:28.270 --> 07:00:28.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:31.490 --> 07:00:31.500 align:start position:0%
the service shall be made on purpose who
 
07:00:32.930 --> 07:00:32.940 align:start position:0%
are not right
 
07:00:34.490 --> 07:00:34.500 align:start position:0%
and the people that are going to be
 
07:00:37.968 --> 07:00:37.978 align:start position:0%
served are whoever the commissioner or
 
07:00:40.368 --> 07:00:40.378 align:start position:0%
leads has reasonably may have violated
 
07:00:41.570 --> 07:00:41.580 align:start position:0%
the code
 
07:00:44.330 --> 07:00:44.340 align:start position:0%
is a super support because like you say
 
07:00:46.310 --> 07:00:46.320 align:start position:0%
yeah the person that served the subpoena
 
07:00:48.530 --> 07:00:48.540 align:start position:0%
they can go and try to wash it but the
 
07:00:50.330 --> 07:00:50.340 align:start position:0%
testimony with this morning and if I
 
07:00:52.610 --> 07:00:52.620 align:start position:0%
read the bill there are no there's no
 
07:00:54.890 --> 07:00:54.900 align:start position:0%
ground to wash it because we don't have
 
07:00:57.170 --> 07:00:57.180 align:start position:0%
any limits to the commissioner's power
 
07:01:00.410 --> 07:01:00.420 align:start position:0%
it doesn't happen it's whenever in when
 
07:01:03.350 --> 07:01:03.360 align:start position:0%
it whatever he thinks or she thinks is
 
07:01:05.750 --> 07:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
reasonable I mean so how are you going
 
07:01:07.548 --> 07:01:07.558 align:start position:0%
to squash and supreme this is more than
 
07:01:09.948 --> 07:01:09.958 align:start position:0%
the attorney generals or whatever of our
 
07:01:11.990 --> 07:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
state of they can't just there's no
 
07:01:15.170 --> 07:01:15.180 align:start position:0%
basis this law just that if they if they
 
07:01:17.510 --> 07:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
think it's going to help them proceed in
 
07:01:19.010 --> 07:01:19.020 align:start position:0%
an investigation the investigation
 
07:01:21.590 --> 07:01:21.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to be started okay it's
 
07:01:24.590 --> 07:01:24.600 align:start position:0%
just then they can get it and so yeah
 
07:01:26.810 --> 07:01:26.820 align:start position:0%
you're right you can of course but what
 
07:01:29.270 --> 07:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
I'm asking it please let's put in the
 
07:01:31.850 --> 07:01:31.860 align:start position:0%
due process and the limits that tell
 
07:01:34.968 --> 07:01:34.978 align:start position:0%
what the commissioner can get this is
 
07:01:38.570 --> 07:01:38.580 align:start position:0%
just uh I would not give this to anybody
 
07:01:38.580 --> 07:01:40.868 align:start position:0%
just uh I would not give this to anybody
um

07:01:40.868 --> 07:01:40.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:44.030 --> 07:01:44.040 align:start position:0%
all of us it's not just teachers or
 
07:01:46.968 --> 07:01:46.978 align:start position:0%
licenses it's everybody
 
07:01:49.788 --> 07:01:49.798 align:start position:0%
um and and again we have no there's no
 
07:01:51.410 --> 07:01:51.420 align:start position:0%
way to find it because it doesn't say
 
07:01:53.510 --> 07:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
the commissioner has to have established
 
07:01:55.788 --> 07:01:55.798 align:start position:0%
XYZ before they put subpoena is going to
 
07:01:57.590 --> 07:01:57.600 align:start position:0%
get the information or it needs to be
 
07:01:59.110 --> 07:01:59.120 align:start position:0%
within this ground
 
07:02:01.490 --> 07:02:01.500 align:start position:0%
or this or the person that's not on
 
07:02:09.310 --> 07:02:09.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:11.628 --> 07:02:11.638 align:start position:0%
please let's put
 
07:02:13.430 --> 07:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
let's see what our friends have been
 
07:02:15.830 --> 07:02:15.840 align:start position:0%
testified after you know the presenters
 
07:02:17.868 --> 07:02:17.878 align:start position:0%
and let's let's provide some due process
 
07:02:20.090 --> 07:02:20.100 align:start position:0%
comments to make sure that our health to
 
07:02:22.490 --> 07:02:22.500 align:start position:0%
correct privacy
 
07:02:24.590 --> 07:02:24.600 align:start position:0%
I guess I just have to say to respond I
 
07:02:27.170 --> 07:02:27.180 align:start position:0%
I don't see any due process issues
 
07:02:29.150 --> 07:02:29.160 align:start position:0%
whatsoever here this is this is sort of
 
07:02:31.070 --> 07:02:31.080 align:start position:0%
really sort of standard language that
 
07:02:32.868 --> 07:02:32.878 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General suggested putting
 
07:02:35.030 --> 07:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
in reasonable costs so when you say
 
07:02:37.730 --> 07:02:37.740 align:start position:0%
there are no limits so the commissioner
 
07:02:41.270 --> 07:02:41.280 align:start position:0%
issues The subpoena for Teacher X to
 
07:02:43.010 --> 07:02:43.020 align:start position:0%
provide or or the school district to
 
07:02:45.590 --> 07:02:45.600 align:start position:0%
provide records on teacher X
 
07:02:47.930 --> 07:02:47.940 align:start position:0%
um and and the school district objects
 
07:02:50.330 --> 07:02:50.340 align:start position:0%
and says uh you know and moves to quash
 
07:02:53.530 --> 07:02:53.540 align:start position:0%
and the and the so it now goes to court
 
07:02:56.270 --> 07:02:56.280 align:start position:0%
and the judge says to the commissioner
 
07:02:58.310 --> 07:02:58.320 align:start position:0%
what's your basis for issuing this
 
07:03:00.110 --> 07:03:00.120 align:start position:0%
subpoena for these records for for
 
07:03:03.530 --> 07:03:03.540 align:start position:0%
Teacher X and the commissioner says uh
 
07:03:05.690 --> 07:03:05.700 align:start position:0%
you know I heard an art I heard an art a
 
07:03:08.510 --> 07:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
news article on TV uh that there's a lot
 
07:03:12.850 --> 07:03:12.860 align:start position:0%
of problems with uh with uh teachers uh
 
07:03:15.230 --> 07:03:15.240 align:start position:0%
exercising too much force against their
 
07:03:17.270 --> 07:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
students and so you know I thought I'd
 
07:03:19.250 --> 07:03:19.260 align:start position:0%
issue The subpoena to find out if
 
07:03:22.010 --> 07:03:22.020 align:start position:0%
teacher X is doing that the judges is
 
07:03:23.930 --> 07:03:23.940 align:start position:0%
not only going to quash The subpoena but
 
07:03:26.810 --> 07:03:26.820 align:start position:0%
is going to impose uh attorney's fees
 
07:03:29.208 --> 07:03:29.218 align:start position:0%
against the Chief Justice when you you
 
07:03:31.128 --> 07:03:31.138 align:start position:0%
you know a lot about law I don't you
 
07:03:32.570 --> 07:03:32.580 align:start position:0%
know I'm just an attorney that went back
 
07:03:34.190 --> 07:03:34.200 align:start position:0%
to practice after my kids went to
 
07:03:36.708 --> 07:03:36.718 align:start position:0%
college but what I'm saying is I see
 
07:03:39.048 --> 07:03:39.058 align:start position:0%
here when it says I the commissioner of
 
07:03:42.230 --> 07:03:42.240 align:start position:0%
Education can send a subpoena to me and
 
07:03:44.810 --> 07:03:44.820 align:start position:0%
there's nothing nothing here that says
 
07:03:48.048 --> 07:03:48.058 align:start position:0%
how I'm going to quash that or how I'm
 
07:03:49.548 --> 07:03:49.558 align:start position:0%
going to pay for the attorney to help me
 
07:03:51.890 --> 07:03:51.900 align:start position:0%
quash that to figure out all that stuff
 
07:03:54.468 --> 07:03:54.478 align:start position:0%
I'm telling you this this is dangerous
 
07:03:56.570 --> 07:03:56.580 align:start position:0%
this is dangerous to everybody that's
 
07:03:57.650 --> 07:03:57.660 align:start position:0%
sitting here
 
07:04:00.350 --> 07:04:00.360 align:start position:0%
representative Perez
 
07:04:02.690 --> 07:04:02.700 align:start position:0%
I think we've lost sight
 
07:04:02.700 --> 07:04:03.890 align:start position:0%
I think we've lost sight
of

07:04:03.890 --> 07:04:03.900 align:start position:0%
of
 
07:04:07.788 --> 07:04:07.798 align:start position:0%
what the intent here is the intent here
 
07:04:10.730 --> 07:04:10.740 align:start position:0%
is to protect
 
07:04:10.740 --> 07:04:12.350 align:start position:0%
is to protect
children

07:04:12.350 --> 07:04:12.360 align:start position:0%
children
 
07:04:16.610 --> 07:04:16.620 align:start position:0%
not to protect you and me not to protect
 
07:04:20.448 --> 07:04:20.458 align:start position:0%
anybody but children and I have listened
 
07:04:22.788 --> 07:04:22.798 align:start position:0%
in the past three months that I've been
 
07:04:22.798 --> 07:04:24.048 align:start position:0%
in the past three months that I've been
here

07:04:24.048 --> 07:04:24.058 align:start position:0%
here
 
07:04:27.230 --> 07:04:27.240 align:start position:0%
waiting for people to speak up
 
07:04:30.110 --> 07:04:30.120 align:start position:0%
for the children and I keep hearing it
 
07:04:32.990 --> 07:04:33.000 align:start position:0%
squashed this has been going on for
 
07:04:37.030 --> 07:04:37.040 align:start position:0%
years the reason why it is more
 
07:04:40.190 --> 07:04:40.200 align:start position:0%
important right now is because over the
 
07:04:43.490 --> 07:04:43.500 align:start position:0%
past three years parents have finally
 
07:04:47.030 --> 07:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
seen what is going on in the schools
 
07:04:50.030 --> 07:04:50.040 align:start position:0%
because of Zoom they have issues the
 
07:04:52.850 --> 07:04:52.860 align:start position:0%
reason why Frank edova put out that
 
07:04:55.670 --> 07:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
thing is that information is because he
 
07:04:59.468 --> 07:04:59.478 align:start position:0%
has an overwhelming number of of
 
07:05:03.048 --> 07:05:03.058 align:start position:0%
complaints about human rights I went to
 
07:05:05.510 --> 07:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
school board meetings and saw parents
 
07:05:09.890 --> 07:05:09.900 align:start position:0%
crying because their children their even
 
07:05:13.010 --> 07:05:13.020 align:start position:0%
their their handicapped children had
 
07:05:16.190 --> 07:05:16.200 align:start position:0%
rashes on their mouth bleeding because
 
07:05:19.968 --> 07:05:19.978 align:start position:0%
of mass because they drooled that to me
 
07:05:23.208 --> 07:05:23.218 align:start position:0%
was a human rights violation that is why
 
07:05:25.250 --> 07:05:25.260 align:start position:0%
it is important now
 
07:05:28.310 --> 07:05:28.320 align:start position:0%
we all we want to do is protect the
 
07:05:31.368 --> 07:05:31.378 align:start position:0%
children years ago I have a 43 year old
 
07:05:33.230 --> 07:05:33.240 align:start position:0%
daughter I was on the school board in
 
07:05:35.030 --> 07:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
Hollis Brookline I voted against
 
07:05:37.310 --> 07:05:37.320 align:start position:0%
something my daughter's sixth grade
 
07:05:40.070 --> 07:05:40.080 align:start position:0%
teacher would not allow her to go to the
 
07:05:44.810 --> 07:05:44.820 align:start position:0%
bathroom because of me because of me
 
07:05:47.628 --> 07:05:47.638 align:start position:0%
this has been going on for years if we
 
07:05:51.530 --> 07:05:51.540 align:start position:0%
can protect one child by this it is
 
07:05:54.530 --> 07:05:54.540 align:start position:0%
worth it we need to protect the children
 
07:05:57.230 --> 07:05:57.240 align:start position:0%
the parents need a way of doing that
 
07:06:01.610 --> 07:06:01.620 align:start position:0%
they don't have the the parents Union to
 
07:06:05.208 --> 07:06:05.218 align:start position:0%
to help them these kids are being hurt
 
07:06:07.310 --> 07:06:07.320 align:start position:0%
and I don't mean that physically but I
 
07:06:10.548 --> 07:06:10.558 align:start position:0%
mean kids are being hurt it's been going
 
07:06:13.670 --> 07:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
on for years it's worse now it is time
 
07:06:17.208 --> 07:06:17.218 align:start position:0%
to do something for these children
 
07:06:19.368 --> 07:06:19.378 align:start position:0%
you're worried about a lawsuit against
 
07:06:22.670 --> 07:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
you or you or you what about the kid and
 
07:06:24.948 --> 07:06:24.958 align:start position:0%
if it takes three years and that's what
 
07:06:27.770 --> 07:06:27.780 align:start position:0%
it's hat taking for parents to get some
 
07:06:31.070 --> 07:06:31.080 align:start position:0%
resolution what happens to that kid in
 
07:06:34.128 --> 07:06:34.138 align:start position:0%
the meantime what have you done to that
 
07:06:36.110 --> 07:06:36.120 align:start position:0%
child because of what you're worried
 
07:06:39.170 --> 07:06:39.180 align:start position:0%
about worry about the kids I'm sorry I'm
 
07:06:39.180 --> 07:06:40.968 align:start position:0%
about worry about the kids I'm sorry I'm
angry

07:06:40.968 --> 07:06:40.978 align:start position:0%
angry
 
07:06:43.368 --> 07:06:43.378 align:start position:0%
are there anyone else wish to be heard
 
07:06:45.590 --> 07:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
07:06:45.600 --> 07:06:46.610 align:start position:0%
uh representative
the

07:06:46.610 --> 07:06:46.620 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:06:49.128 --> 07:06:49.138 align:start position:0%
hello and listening to all this this
 
07:06:51.048 --> 07:06:51.058 align:start position:0%
of all I've
 
07:06:54.350 --> 07:06:54.360 align:start position:0%
a lot of people that got up opposed
 
07:06:54.360 --> 07:06:56.330 align:start position:0%
a lot of people that got up opposed
everything

07:06:56.330 --> 07:06:56.340 align:start position:0%
everything
 
07:06:59.090 --> 07:06:59.100 align:start position:0%
um so I first of all think um we gotta
 
07:07:02.270 --> 07:07:02.280 align:start position:0%
our educators are out there to take care
 
07:07:04.368 --> 07:07:04.378 align:start position:0%
of our children
 
07:07:07.610 --> 07:07:07.620 align:start position:0%
they are they are they are trying to
 
07:07:11.030 --> 07:07:11.040 align:start position:0%
educate them the best that they know but
 
07:07:14.270 --> 07:07:14.280 align:start position:0%
you know there are times I mean I'm sure
 
07:07:16.788 --> 07:07:16.798 align:start position:0%
there are times that some children get
 
07:07:19.368 --> 07:07:19.378 align:start position:0%
unruly but you know what then they're
 
07:07:21.288 --> 07:07:21.298 align:start position:0%
then they're dealt with and sent to the
 
07:07:23.030 --> 07:07:23.040 align:start position:0%
principal or whatever they need to do
 
07:07:25.730 --> 07:07:25.740 align:start position:0%
you know the thing is we got to think of
 
07:07:28.250 --> 07:07:28.260 align:start position:0%
our Educators too people are not going
 
07:07:30.048 --> 07:07:30.058 align:start position:0%
to go into this field
 
07:07:33.230 --> 07:07:33.240 align:start position:0%
to care for our kids and to teach our
 
07:07:37.730 --> 07:07:37.740 align:start position:0%
kids and for us to continue to keep our
 
07:07:40.968 --> 07:07:40.978 align:start position:0%
our children here in New Hampshire we're
 
07:07:42.830 --> 07:07:42.840 align:start position:0%
going to think about what we're doing
 
07:07:46.010 --> 07:07:46.020 align:start position:0%
here where we came here to represent New
 
07:07:46.020 --> 07:07:47.330 align:start position:0%
here where we came here to represent New
Hampshire

07:07:47.330 --> 07:07:47.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
07:07:50.390 --> 07:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
and we're also trying to represent our
 
07:07:54.650 --> 07:07:54.660 align:start position:0%
our Educators as well as our students
 
07:07:57.230 --> 07:07:57.240 align:start position:0%
okay and we got to think about the
 
07:08:00.230 --> 07:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
parents I think if we give too much
 
07:08:03.590 --> 07:08:03.600 align:start position:0%
um this um subpoena power the big thing
 
07:08:06.830 --> 07:08:06.840 align:start position:0%
is first of all when we um did listen to
 
07:08:09.110 --> 07:08:09.120 align:start position:0%
the first uh the detective talking about
 
07:08:11.390 --> 07:08:11.400 align:start position:0%
or he was a detective pardon me uh
 
07:08:13.968 --> 07:08:13.978 align:start position:0%
Richard Farrow he gave the one percent
 
07:08:13.978 --> 07:08:15.830 align:start position:0%
Richard Farrow he gave the one percent
now

07:08:15.830 --> 07:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
now
 
07:08:18.110 --> 07:08:18.120 align:start position:0%
um I know right away when representative
 
07:08:20.448 --> 07:08:20.458 align:start position:0%
Brennan asked about what about the one
 
07:08:24.110 --> 07:08:24.120 align:start position:0%
percent she's asked him about it and he
 
07:08:27.410 --> 07:08:27.420 align:start position:0%
did not say it was not educators
 
07:08:30.650 --> 07:08:30.660 align:start position:0%
about the educated he he never came back
 
07:08:33.590 --> 07:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
and said nothing about it not he was
 
07:08:36.410 --> 07:08:36.420 align:start position:0%
able to at that point retract his
 
07:08:39.350 --> 07:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
statement and go into that he did not
 
07:08:41.690 --> 07:08:41.700 align:start position:0%
so I think that I think we need to think
 
07:08:43.788 --> 07:08:43.798 align:start position:0%
about the whole picture what we listen
 
07:08:45.230 --> 07:08:45.240 align:start position:0%
to today
 
07:08:46.968 --> 07:08:46.978 align:start position:0%
and also
 
07:08:48.890 --> 07:08:48.900 align:start position:0%
um thinking about you know we don't want
 
07:08:51.110 --> 07:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
to give people too much power
 
07:08:54.170 --> 07:08:54.180 align:start position:0%
I mean we are here to help to make those
 
07:08:56.330 --> 07:08:56.340 align:start position:0%
decisions but we also got to think about
 
07:08:59.750 --> 07:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
our Educators as well I know as I say I
 
07:09:01.610 --> 07:09:01.620 align:start position:0%
believe in our Educators I've had three
 
07:09:04.490 --> 07:09:04.500 align:start position:0%
grown children now they all went through
 
07:09:07.968 --> 07:09:07.978 align:start position:0%
the school system and in Goffstown they
 
07:09:10.548 --> 07:09:10.558 align:start position:0%
then went on to college and have done
 
07:09:13.788 --> 07:09:13.798 align:start position:0%
well and this is what we need to think
 
07:09:18.530 --> 07:09:18.540 align:start position:0%
about you know is to continue to yes I
 
07:09:21.170 --> 07:09:21.180 align:start position:0%
am concerned also about children and I
 
07:09:23.208 --> 07:09:23.218 align:start position:0%
because I work in a labor and delivery
 
07:09:24.890 --> 07:09:24.900 align:start position:0%
field I would not be bringing children
 
07:09:27.230 --> 07:09:27.240 align:start position:0%
continuing to do that if I'm not
 
07:09:29.930 --> 07:09:29.940 align:start position:0%
concerned about children and but at the
 
07:09:32.570 --> 07:09:32.580 align:start position:0%
same time we also need to stand up for
 
07:09:34.968 --> 07:09:34.978 align:start position:0%
what's right thank you anyone else wish
 
07:09:38.690 --> 07:09:38.700 align:start position:0%
to be heard on HB 533 uh yes
 
07:09:40.368 --> 07:09:40.378 align:start position:0%
representative Stapleton
 
07:09:42.708 --> 07:09:42.718 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um
 
07:09:44.690 --> 07:09:44.700 align:start position:0%
that was interesting about your
 
07:09:48.230 --> 07:09:48.240 align:start position:0%
explanation about how subpoenas work
 
07:09:50.868 --> 07:09:50.878 align:start position:0%
it sounds as though it's not unlike a
 
07:09:53.048 --> 07:09:53.058 align:start position:0%
dispute procedure
 
07:09:56.090 --> 07:09:56.100 align:start position:0%
if you contest or disagree with the
 
07:09:56.100 --> 07:09:57.170 align:start position:0%
if you contest or disagree with the
subpoena

07:09:57.170 --> 07:09:57.180 align:start position:0%
subpoena
 
07:09:59.930 --> 07:09:59.940 align:start position:0%
and you're going to go to court to hear
 
07:10:03.288 --> 07:10:03.298 align:start position:0%
it then the clock stops until a judge or
 
07:10:05.270 --> 07:10:05.280 align:start position:0%
the court makes a decision
 
07:10:07.730 --> 07:10:07.740 align:start position:0%
I think that's a nice process to have
 
07:10:11.390 --> 07:10:11.400 align:start position:0%
just like it's nice to have dispute
 
07:10:14.868 --> 07:10:14.878 align:start position:0%
um to protect uh people uh against uh
 
07:10:14.878 --> 07:10:16.368 align:start position:0%
um to protect uh people uh against uh
unfair

07:10:16.368 --> 07:10:16.378 align:start position:0%
unfair
 
07:10:18.650 --> 07:10:18.660 align:start position:0%
uh inquiry or action
 
07:10:21.770 --> 07:10:21.780 align:start position:0%
relative to the service I see that in
 
07:10:23.390 --> 07:10:23.400 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
07:10:26.930 --> 07:10:26.940 align:start position:0%
um sub B and C provide for two
 
07:10:29.150 --> 07:10:29.160 align:start position:0%
circumstances a service made on
 
07:10:31.850 --> 07:10:31.860 align:start position:0%
licensees and certified individuals by
 
07:10:33.430 --> 07:10:33.440 align:start position:0%
certified mail
 
07:10:37.310 --> 07:10:37.320 align:start position:0%
or with or by hand
 
07:10:40.250 --> 07:10:40.260 align:start position:0%
um and then see service made on persons
 
07:10:42.468 --> 07:10:42.478 align:start position:0%
who are not licensees or certified
 
07:10:42.478 --> 07:10:43.910 align:start position:0%
who are not licensees or certified
individuals

07:10:43.910 --> 07:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
07:10:46.190 --> 07:10:46.200 align:start position:0%
are in accordance with procedures and
 
07:10:49.430 --> 07:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
fee schedules of the Superior Court
 
07:10:52.430 --> 07:10:52.440 align:start position:0%
so it's it's not like that unlicensy
 
07:10:54.948 --> 07:10:54.958 align:start position:0%
unlicensed people are non-certified or
 
07:10:57.410 --> 07:10:57.420 align:start position:0%
not don't have any protection against
 
07:10:59.750 --> 07:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
the subpoena power
 
07:11:02.510 --> 07:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
um because there's a direct link to the
 
07:11:04.150 --> 07:11:04.160 align:start position:0%
Superior Court
 
07:11:06.770 --> 07:11:06.780 align:start position:0%
that's just my observation right or
 
07:11:09.830 --> 07:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
wrong but it seems like that was a
 
07:11:12.468 --> 07:11:12.478 align:start position:0%
thoughtful addition in the in the
 
07:11:12.478 --> 07:11:13.730 align:start position:0%
thoughtful addition in the in the
amendment

07:11:13.730 --> 07:11:13.740 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
07:11:16.548 --> 07:11:16.558 align:start position:0%
yes representative tour that this is
 
07:11:18.890 --> 07:11:18.900 align:start position:0%
more of a newbie question I guess
 
07:11:18.900 --> 07:11:19.490 align:start position:0%
more of a newbie question I guess
um

07:11:19.490 --> 07:11:19.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:11:23.750 --> 07:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh the idea of giving the commissioner
 
07:11:26.330 --> 07:11:26.340 align:start position:0%
of Education sort of a new broad power
 
07:11:27.948 --> 07:11:27.958 align:start position:0%
that other departments don't have
 
07:11:30.890 --> 07:11:30.900 align:start position:0%
without having that concept go before
 
07:11:32.288 --> 07:11:32.298 align:start position:0%
the education
 
07:11:35.930 --> 07:11:35.940 align:start position:0%
Committee just seems odd to me is I know
 
07:11:37.128 --> 07:11:37.138 align:start position:0%
this is the last day and there's
 
07:11:39.288 --> 07:11:39.298 align:start position:0%
probably no time and this is probably no
 
07:11:42.350 --> 07:11:42.360 align:start position:0%
process for it is there any way for the
 
07:11:44.390 --> 07:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
the committee on education to weigh in
 
07:11:47.510 --> 07:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
on something like this before it
 
07:11:47.520 --> 07:11:49.208 align:start position:0%
on something like this before it
proceeds

07:11:49.208 --> 07:11:49.218 align:start position:0%
proceeds
 
07:11:52.190 --> 07:11:52.200 align:start position:0%
given the time I think that would be you
 
07:11:53.570 --> 07:11:53.580 align:start position:0%
know that would be difficult I mean we
 
07:11:55.788 --> 07:11:55.798 align:start position:0%
could have you know on the floor I
 
07:11:58.128 --> 07:11:58.138 align:start position:0%
suppose that we we uh when the bill gets
 
07:11:59.810 --> 07:11:59.820 align:start position:0%
to the floor but I think it probably
 
07:12:01.730 --> 07:12:01.740 align:start position:0%
would be
 
07:12:04.968 --> 07:12:04.978 align:start position:0%
um would be difficult to do that at this
 
07:12:06.048 --> 07:12:06.058 align:start position:0%
point but you know the one thing you
 
07:12:08.150 --> 07:12:08.160 align:start position:0%
said I think when you say that I think
 
07:12:10.850 --> 07:12:10.860 align:start position:0%
it's really important to understand
 
07:12:13.368 --> 07:12:13.378 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General
 
07:12:15.468 --> 07:12:15.478 align:start position:0%
indicated to me because that was one of
 
07:12:17.750 --> 07:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
my questions to the attorney general to
 
07:12:20.090 --> 07:12:20.100 align:start position:0%
do other agencies have subpoena power
 
07:12:22.310 --> 07:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
and he sent me back an email said you
 
07:12:24.048 --> 07:12:24.058 align:start position:0%
know listing a bunch of agencies now he
 
07:12:27.590 --> 07:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
he did say many of those agencies that
 
07:12:29.628 --> 07:12:29.638 align:start position:0%
used to have their own subpoena power
 
07:12:32.750 --> 07:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
are now under the oplc and it's there
 
07:12:35.810 --> 07:12:35.820 align:start position:0%
it's the oplcs to Pina power but it's
 
07:12:37.368 --> 07:12:37.378 align:start position:0%
not true
 
07:12:39.590 --> 07:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
that we would be giving the education
 
07:12:42.410 --> 07:12:42.420 align:start position:0%
department a subpoena power that no
 
07:12:44.570 --> 07:12:44.580 align:start position:0%
other agency has mode in fact most of
 
07:12:47.390 --> 07:12:47.400 align:start position:0%
them do have it even even though I think
 
07:12:48.770 --> 07:12:48.780 align:start position:0%
this is another important part even
 
07:12:48.780 --> 07:12:50.208 align:start position:0%
this is another important part even
though

07:12:50.208 --> 07:12:50.218 align:start position:0%
though
 
07:12:53.690 --> 07:12:53.700 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General is sort of for lack
 
07:12:57.830 --> 07:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
of a better term the super you know uh
 
07:13:00.708 --> 07:13:00.718 align:start position:0%
law enforcer if you will the Attorney
 
07:13:04.010 --> 07:13:04.020 align:start position:0%
General can can basically get involved
 
07:13:06.048 --> 07:13:06.058 align:start position:0%
in with with with the enforcement
 
07:13:09.468 --> 07:13:09.478 align:start position:0%
activities of any agency and could could
 
07:13:11.330 --> 07:13:11.340 align:start position:0%
issue subpoenas in connection with that
 
07:13:14.030 --> 07:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
but none notwithstanding that
 
07:13:16.788 --> 07:13:16.798 align:start position:0%
many agencies have their own subpoena
 
07:13:19.610 --> 07:13:19.620 align:start position:0%
power because generally unless there's
 
07:13:22.670 --> 07:13:22.680 align:start position:0%
some you know unless there's some really
 
07:13:24.890 --> 07:13:24.900 align:start position:0%
huge overriding public interest the
 
07:13:26.208 --> 07:13:26.218 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office doesn't get
 
07:13:28.250 --> 07:13:28.260 align:start position:0%
involved in if you know if a teacher's
 
07:13:29.750 --> 07:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
if there's a claim that a teacher needs
 
07:13:31.010 --> 07:13:31.020 align:start position:0%
to be disciplined for one reason or
 
07:13:32.810 --> 07:13:32.820 align:start position:0%
another it's usually the education
 
07:13:34.490 --> 07:13:34.500 align:start position:0%
department that handles that as opposed
 
07:13:36.590 --> 07:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
to the Attorney General's office and the
 
07:13:39.410 --> 07:13:39.420 align:start position:0%
same is true if there's you know if some
 
07:13:44.810 --> 07:13:44.820 align:start position:0%
if if uh somebody that's uh uh a barber
 
07:13:47.150 --> 07:13:47.160 align:start position:0%
is you know is has violated some of the
 
07:13:48.770 --> 07:13:48.780 align:start position:0%
conditions of the whatever the barber
 
07:13:51.948 --> 07:13:51.958 align:start position:0%
code is it's usually I guess I think The
 
07:13:53.628 --> 07:13:53.638 align:start position:0%
Barbers are under the oplc so it would
 
07:13:55.490 --> 07:13:55.500 align:start position:0%
be the oplc as opposed to the attorney
 
07:13:57.288 --> 07:13:57.298 align:start position:0%
general that would take care of those
 
07:13:59.628 --> 07:13:59.638 align:start position:0%
kind of things all right I'll say I I do
 
07:14:01.490 --> 07:14:01.500 align:start position:0%
wish they had appeared before us they
 
07:14:03.590 --> 07:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
they the AG's office came for the
 
07:14:05.570 --> 07:14:05.580 align:start position:0%
initial hearing on this bill when it was
 
07:14:07.070 --> 07:14:07.080 align:start position:0%
in its former form and it would have
 
07:14:08.990 --> 07:14:09.000 align:start position:0%
been great to have their input for this
 
07:14:09.000 --> 07:14:10.670 align:start position:0%
been great to have their input for this
too

07:14:10.670 --> 07:14:10.680 align:start position:0%
too
 
07:14:21.170 --> 07:14:21.180 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:25.610 --> 07:14:25.620 align:start position:0%
there's as some superpower
 
07:14:28.968 --> 07:14:28.978 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:32.330 --> 07:14:32.340 align:start position:0%
I've avoided trying to get into this but
 
07:14:32.340 --> 07:14:42.110 align:start position:0%
I've avoided trying to get into this but
teachers

07:14:42.110 --> 07:14:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:44.868 --> 07:14:44.878 align:start position:0%
I read it I read a book by a guy by the
 
07:14:48.530 --> 07:14:48.540 align:start position:0%
name of it was Hal or but anyway
 
07:14:50.868 --> 07:14:50.878 align:start position:0%
if you look at teachers and if you look
 
07:14:52.968 --> 07:14:52.978 align:start position:0%
at what the how they do in high in
 
07:14:52.978 --> 07:14:54.190 align:start position:0%
at what the how they do in high in
college

07:14:54.190 --> 07:14:54.200 align:start position:0%
college
 
07:14:58.990 --> 07:14:59.000 align:start position:0%
there and and how the how they graduate
 
07:15:03.350 --> 07:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
they have the lowest accumulation of SAT
 
07:15:06.468 --> 07:15:06.478 align:start position:0%
scores of almost any major
 
07:15:09.650 --> 07:15:09.660 align:start position:0%
yeah and she there's nothing it's not
 
07:15:11.628 --> 07:15:11.638 align:start position:0%
hard to understand because
 
07:15:14.150 --> 07:15:14.160 align:start position:0%
we've allowed and I thought it was a
 
07:15:17.270 --> 07:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
great idea teachers to become astronauts
 
07:15:20.090 --> 07:15:20.100 align:start position:0%
to become lawyers to become doctors and
 
07:15:21.410 --> 07:15:21.420 align:start position:0%
everything else and that didn't used to
 
07:15:23.330 --> 07:15:23.340 align:start position:0%
be true women
 
07:15:25.968 --> 07:15:25.978 align:start position:0%
in the 60s were
 
07:15:29.330 --> 07:15:29.340 align:start position:0%
pretty much left to their to be to being
 
07:15:31.070 --> 07:15:31.080 align:start position:0%
a teacher
 
07:15:34.190 --> 07:15:34.200 align:start position:0%
a librarian or a nurse or getting
 
07:15:34.200 --> 07:15:35.468 align:start position:0%
a librarian or a nurse or getting
married

07:15:35.468 --> 07:15:35.478 align:start position:0%
married
 
07:15:38.208 --> 07:15:38.218 align:start position:0%
but but that's changed the world has
 
07:15:40.310 --> 07:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
changed so
 
07:15:43.610 --> 07:15:43.620 align:start position:0%
the people left to be teachers
 
07:15:46.310 --> 07:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
are not the biggest and brightest group
 
07:15:48.890 --> 07:15:48.900 align:start position:0%
of people we tend to think they are some
 
07:15:50.750 --> 07:15:50.760 align:start position:0%
of them are but they're really not
 
07:15:50.760 --> 07:15:52.548 align:start position:0%
of them are but they're really not
collectively

07:15:52.548 --> 07:15:52.558 align:start position:0%
collectively
 
07:15:55.368 --> 07:15:55.378 align:start position:0%
so we have to be careful when we're
 
07:15:59.930 --> 07:15:59.940 align:start position:0%
using them as an example of of what how
 
07:16:03.170 --> 07:16:03.180 align:start position:0%
to decide what we're going to do you
 
07:16:05.208 --> 07:16:05.218 align:start position:0%
know we need to realize these are just
 
07:16:06.650 --> 07:16:06.660 align:start position:0%
regular people
 
07:16:10.250 --> 07:16:10.260 align:start position:0%
they walk down the street and and and we
 
07:16:13.490 --> 07:16:13.500 align:start position:0%
they may may need to be subpoenaed there
 
07:16:15.530 --> 07:16:15.540 align:start position:0%
are bright ones among them they're the
 
07:16:21.230 --> 07:16:21.240 align:start position:0%
head of the uh the AC aft and the uh and
 
07:16:24.948 --> 07:16:24.958 align:start position:0%
so on but yeah they're not the brightest
 
07:16:27.708 --> 07:16:27.718 align:start position:0%
bunch of people and we we need to
 
07:16:30.230 --> 07:16:30.240 align:start position:0%
realize that we're we're putting trying
 
07:16:33.110 --> 07:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
to put some rules in the reason we need
 
07:16:37.368 --> 07:16:37.378 align:start position:0%
them is because they've changed so
 
07:16:39.410 --> 07:16:39.420 align:start position:0%
yes representative Smith
 
07:16:41.868 --> 07:16:41.878 align:start position:0%
thank you very much first
 
07:16:44.208 --> 07:16:44.218 align:start position:0%
um representative testerman I'm
 
07:16:46.070 --> 07:16:46.080 align:start position:0%
wondering if the same thing could be
 
07:16:50.350 --> 07:16:50.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:52.430 --> 07:16:52.440 align:start position:0%
might be
 
07:16:54.708 --> 07:16:54.718 align:start position:0%
um but I thank you I thank you for your
 
07:16:58.128 --> 07:16:58.138 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:03.170 --> 07:17:03.180 align:start position:0%
I I this amendment has no criteria no
 
07:17:06.350 --> 07:17:06.360 align:start position:0%
criteria for when a subpoena can be
 
07:17:08.750 --> 07:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
issued as written the amendment allows
 
07:17:10.850 --> 07:17:10.860 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education to issue a
 
07:17:14.570 --> 07:17:14.580 align:start position:0%
subpoena in the absence of a formal
 
07:17:16.250 --> 07:17:16.260 align:start position:0%
written complaint
 
07:17:19.010 --> 07:17:19.020 align:start position:0%
just the subpoenas seems to come first
 
07:17:21.288 --> 07:17:21.298 align:start position:0%
I don't think the absence of such
 
07:17:24.048 --> 07:17:24.058 align:start position:0%
criteria before the issuance of the
 
07:17:26.510 --> 07:17:26.520 align:start position:0%
subpoena is appropriate it also allows
 
07:17:28.548 --> 07:17:28.558 align:start position:0%
the department to issue subpoena in the
 
07:17:30.530 --> 07:17:30.540 align:start position:0%
absence of an investigation formally
 
07:17:33.230 --> 07:17:33.240 align:start position:0%
being open where the department has
 
07:17:35.570 --> 07:17:35.580 align:start position:0%
initially determined that a possible
 
07:17:38.510 --> 07:17:38.520 align:start position:0%
violation of the code of conduct has
 
07:17:40.310 --> 07:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
occurred it just says if the
 
07:17:42.708 --> 07:17:42.718 align:start position:0%
commissioner thinks that maybe there's
 
07:17:45.410 --> 07:17:45.420 align:start position:0%
been a problem then they issue a
 
07:17:45.420 --> 07:17:46.430 align:start position:0%
been a problem then they issue a
subpoena

07:17:46.430 --> 07:17:46.440 align:start position:0%
subpoena
 
07:17:49.190 --> 07:17:49.200 align:start position:0%
I I think subpoena is a pretty darn
 
07:17:51.530 --> 07:17:51.540 align:start position:0%
important and pretty powerful and I
 
07:17:54.350 --> 07:17:54.360 align:start position:0%
don't see them being something that
 
07:17:56.570 --> 07:17:56.580 align:start position:0%
would be issued at the whim of anybody
 
07:17:58.128 --> 07:17:58.138 align:start position:0%
even me
 
07:18:00.048 --> 07:18:00.058 align:start position:0%
I mean I shouldn't be allowed to issue
 
07:18:01.788 --> 07:18:01.798 align:start position:0%
even though I know everything there is
 
07:18:03.590 --> 07:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
to know except what bill I was talking
 
07:18:05.690 --> 07:18:05.700 align:start position:0%
about earlier
 
07:18:08.690 --> 07:18:08.700 align:start position:0%
um it's they're important limitations on
 
07:18:11.690 --> 07:18:11.700 align:start position:0%
subpoena powers and there should be if
 
07:18:15.548 --> 07:18:15.558 align:start position:0%
you look at the statute about oplc
 
07:18:19.670 --> 07:18:19.680 align:start position:0%
they cannot issue a subpoena until an
 
07:18:23.930 --> 07:18:23.940 align:start position:0%
investigation has commenced and the oplc
 
07:18:26.270 --> 07:18:26.280 align:start position:0%
is the example that the chair has given
 
07:18:28.490 --> 07:18:28.500 align:start position:0%
on a number of occasions about Well
 
07:18:32.048 --> 07:18:32.058 align:start position:0%
everybody's doing it including the oplc
 
07:18:35.390 --> 07:18:35.400 align:start position:0%
there always should be checks on the
 
07:18:37.730 --> 07:18:37.740 align:start position:0%
ability to issue a subpoena usually
 
07:18:41.150 --> 07:18:41.160 align:start position:0%
there's a lawsuit there's Discovery
 
07:18:42.830 --> 07:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
um there's you know the whole you know
 
07:18:45.650 --> 07:18:45.660 align:start position:0%
laws against discrimination none of that
 
07:18:50.208 --> 07:18:50.218 align:start position:0%
is in this this is it seems to be people
 
07:18:52.850 --> 07:18:52.860 align:start position:0%
going on a fishing Expedition which
 
07:18:54.350 --> 07:18:54.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that it should be governed
 
07:18:56.330 --> 07:18:56.340 align:start position:0%
by Fish and Game it shouldn't it should
 
07:18:58.788 --> 07:18:58.798 align:start position:0%
be governed by the Attorney General's
 
07:19:02.030 --> 07:19:02.040 align:start position:0%
office because the Attorney General one
 
07:19:06.230 --> 07:19:06.240 align:start position:0%
hopes is fully cognizant of the reasons
 
07:19:07.850 --> 07:19:07.860 align:start position:0%
that you have to have limitations on
 
07:19:12.468 --> 07:19:12.478 align:start position:0%
subpoenas I do not worship teachers I do
 
07:19:16.730 --> 07:19:16.740 align:start position:0%
not worship teachers unions I I don't
 
07:19:18.650 --> 07:19:18.660 align:start position:0%
think that they're any different than
 
07:19:20.810 --> 07:19:20.820 align:start position:0%
anybody else and they should be subject
 
07:19:23.390 --> 07:19:23.400 align:start position:0%
to the same standard and the same
 
07:19:26.150 --> 07:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
accountability as anybody else that's
 
07:19:28.788 --> 07:19:28.798 align:start position:0%
part of why I
 
07:19:31.610 --> 07:19:31.620 align:start position:0%
I believe that nobody should have
 
07:19:35.090 --> 07:19:35.100 align:start position:0%
immunity then why don't we give them
 
07:19:39.110 --> 07:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
that direction in this law I mean this
 
07:19:40.610 --> 07:19:40.620 align:start position:0%
has been around it's been sitting around
 
07:19:43.190 --> 07:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
you seem to know an awful lot about how
 
07:19:45.468 --> 07:19:45.478 align:start position:0%
it ought to be several people in this
 
07:19:47.208 --> 07:19:47.218 align:start position:0%
room know it seem to know how it should
 
07:19:47.218 --> 07:19:48.170 align:start position:0%
room know it seem to know how it should
be

07:19:48.170 --> 07:19:48.180 align:start position:0%
be
 
07:19:51.530 --> 07:19:51.540 align:start position:0%
we should be able to add that in as an
 
07:19:54.170 --> 07:19:54.180 align:start position:0%
amendment now it may need to be a we're
 
07:19:56.208 --> 07:19:56.218 align:start position:0%
going to may need to have to hold this
 
07:19:59.150 --> 07:19:59.160 align:start position:0%
to study it and put it in this fall but
 
07:20:02.330 --> 07:20:02.340 align:start position:0%
yeah we I'd be willing to do that with
 
07:20:03.948 --> 07:20:03.958 align:start position:0%
you representative testerman if you want
 
07:20:06.230 --> 07:20:06.240 align:start position:0%
to hold this until the fall to see if we
 
07:20:07.730 --> 07:20:07.740 align:start position:0%
could come up with something that made
 
07:20:09.890 --> 07:20:09.900 align:start position:0%
sense because I think everybody should
 
07:20:11.510 --> 07:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
be held accountable but they should be
 
07:20:13.968 --> 07:20:13.978 align:start position:0%
held accountable within the restrictions
 
07:20:13.978 --> 07:20:15.650 align:start position:0%
held accountable within the restrictions
of

07:20:15.650 --> 07:20:15.660 align:start position:0%
of
 
07:20:18.170 --> 07:20:18.180 align:start position:0%
um of the democratic process small D
 
07:20:21.288 --> 07:20:21.298 align:start position:0%
Democratic process and accountability
 
07:20:24.048 --> 07:20:24.058 align:start position:0%
that all public officials should have I
 
07:20:26.208 --> 07:20:26.218 align:start position:0%
agree with you I it's just we've been
 
07:20:29.510 --> 07:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
letting this thing sort of slide and we
 
07:20:34.788 --> 07:20:34.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:34.798 --> 07:20:37.368 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

07:20:37.368 --> 07:20:37.378 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:40.128 --> 07:20:40.138 align:start position:0%
right other comments on this yes uh
 
07:20:42.890 --> 07:20:42.900 align:start position:0%
representative Tripp thank you Mr chair
 
07:20:45.230 --> 07:20:45.240 align:start position:0%
you know I've been like Mr testerman
 
07:20:47.930 --> 07:20:47.940 align:start position:0%
representative desperate again sitting
 
07:20:50.890 --> 07:20:50.900 align:start position:0%
here quiet a lot I'm trying to
 
07:20:52.910 --> 07:20:52.920 align:start position:0%
incorporate some of the conversation
 
07:20:54.350 --> 07:20:54.360 align:start position:0%
that's been uh
 
07:20:57.650 --> 07:20:57.660 align:start position:0%
held here but uh there's been a lot of
 
07:21:01.250 --> 07:21:01.260 align:start position:0%
talk about uh there's this is so wide
 
07:21:04.910 --> 07:21:04.920 align:start position:0%
open and if you look at line 10 of the
 
07:21:07.910 --> 07:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
amendment it says for the purpose of
 
07:21:10.490 --> 07:21:10.500 align:start position:0%
carrying out investigations
 
07:21:14.390 --> 07:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
you know it seems that you know that is
 
07:21:16.850 --> 07:21:16.860 align:start position:0%
if you are carrying out an investigation
 
07:21:18.650 --> 07:21:18.660 align:start position:0%
and someone asks well what's the
 
07:21:20.990 --> 07:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
investigation then you know obviously
 
07:21:23.868 --> 07:21:23.878 align:start position:0%
you've begun an investigation
 
07:21:26.570 --> 07:21:26.580 align:start position:0%
you know I don't know what the criteria
 
07:21:31.670 --> 07:21:31.680 align:start position:0%
for uh uh registering it is but uh it
 
07:21:34.490 --> 07:21:34.500 align:start position:0%
seems that this this puts a a little bit
 
07:21:38.150 --> 07:21:38.160 align:start position:0%
of a reins in some of the power of the
 
07:21:41.208 --> 07:21:41.218 align:start position:0%
Department of Education because you know
 
07:21:44.868 --> 07:21:44.878 align:start position:0%
uh if you have an investigation open
 
07:21:48.830 --> 07:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
and if you need a subpoena in order to
 
07:21:50.628 --> 07:21:50.638 align:start position:0%
gather information
 
07:21:50.638 --> 07:21:52.968 align:start position:0%
gather information
then

07:21:52.968 --> 07:21:52.978 align:start position:0%
then
 
07:21:55.968 --> 07:21:55.978 align:start position:0%
it's necessary they have the power to
 
07:21:57.890 --> 07:21:57.900 align:start position:0%
to issue a subpoena
 
07:22:01.910 --> 07:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
you know I know that uh I've had some
 
07:22:01.920 --> 07:22:04.128 align:start position:0%
you know I know that uh I've had some
uh

07:22:04.128 --> 07:22:04.138 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:22:06.590 --> 07:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
conflicts with my school board
 
07:22:09.468 --> 07:22:09.478 align:start position:0%
you know about if you were to ask him a
 
07:22:11.448 --> 07:22:11.458 align:start position:0%
question about something you know their
 
07:22:14.510 --> 07:22:14.520 align:start position:0%
response is always
 
07:22:16.730 --> 07:22:16.740 align:start position:0%
why do you need to know that
 
07:22:21.350 --> 07:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
you know and uh the it seems like uh I
 
07:22:24.410 --> 07:22:24.420 align:start position:0%
wish that I had a subpoena issuing
 
07:22:26.990 --> 07:22:27.000 align:start position:0%
power sometimes because getting an
 
07:22:29.510 --> 07:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
answer of them is very difficult and I
 
07:22:32.930 --> 07:22:32.940 align:start position:0%
I'm not I understand why you know the
 
07:22:36.410 --> 07:22:36.420 align:start position:0%
investigators said that uh uh this would
 
07:22:38.448 --> 07:22:38.458 align:start position:0%
have been handy for 10 years or so
 
07:22:42.770 --> 07:22:42.780 align:start position:0%
 
07:22:46.070 --> 07:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
being told that or asking a question
 
07:22:47.570 --> 07:22:47.580 align:start position:0%
only to be answered with what do you
 
07:22:49.850 --> 07:22:49.860 align:start position:0%
need to know that is is uh is not
 
07:22:51.890 --> 07:22:51.900 align:start position:0%
productive and investigating
 
07:22:54.048 --> 07:22:54.058 align:start position:0%
now so uh
 
07:22:57.708 --> 07:22:57.718 align:start position:0%
I believe that uh the uh the amendment
 
07:22:59.330 --> 07:22:59.340 align:start position:0%
also says there's a reason to believe
 
07:23:02.750 --> 07:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
there's a violation well if there's a
 
07:23:04.968 --> 07:23:04.978 align:start position:0%
reason to believe and he's been assigned
 
07:23:08.448 --> 07:23:08.458 align:start position:0%
uh to carry out an investigation
 
07:23:11.270 --> 07:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
and he's asked questions and he's got no
 
07:23:13.548 --> 07:23:13.558 align:start position:0%
answers then
 
07:23:16.070 --> 07:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
this is the answer
 
07:23:19.490 --> 07:23:19.500 align:start position:0%
thank you president Morgan yes
 
07:23:22.070 --> 07:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
just uh hopefully this will be a couple
 
07:23:24.708 --> 07:23:24.718 align:start position:0%
of comments um one is uh
 
07:23:26.390 --> 07:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
wonders there's a lot of concerned about
 
07:23:28.910 --> 07:23:28.920 align:start position:0%
uh parents in education so the code of
 
07:23:30.948 --> 07:23:30.958 align:start position:0%
conduct and I was just sneaking a peek
 
07:23:32.330 --> 07:23:32.340 align:start position:0%
at it actually says hardly anything
 
07:23:34.368 --> 07:23:34.378 align:start position:0%
about interactions between parents it's
 
07:23:35.330 --> 07:23:35.340 align:start position:0%
all about
 
07:23:38.330 --> 07:23:38.340 align:start position:0%
Educators interaction with the students
 
07:23:40.968 --> 07:23:40.978 align:start position:0%
and other Educators so there's a
 
07:23:42.948 --> 07:23:42.958 align:start position:0%
nothing in the dress is wondering some
 
07:23:44.690 --> 07:23:44.700 align:start position:0%
of the issues that other committees have
 
07:23:47.330 --> 07:23:47.340 align:start position:0%
been struggling with but um so it
 
07:23:49.190 --> 07:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't really solve that issue one way
 
07:23:51.468 --> 07:23:51.478 align:start position:0%
or the other but it does give the
 
07:23:53.868 --> 07:23:53.878 align:start position:0%
commissioner pretty broad power to go in
 
07:23:55.430 --> 07:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
a fishing Expedition
 
07:23:57.830 --> 07:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
um perhaps on even if there's no actual
 
07:23:59.868 --> 07:23:59.878 align:start position:0%
code of conduct violation against a
 
07:24:01.850 --> 07:24:01.860 align:start position:0%
teacher who he or she doesn't uh doesn't
 
07:24:05.750 --> 07:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
approve of but the second comment is um
 
07:24:07.788 --> 07:24:07.798 align:start position:0%
there's well this bill came with a
 
07:24:09.590 --> 07:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
minimal fiscal note they conclude that
 
07:24:11.030 --> 07:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
Department of Education thought there'd
 
07:24:14.208 --> 07:24:14.218 align:start position:0%
be no uh additional costs so that's why
 
07:24:16.430 --> 07:24:16.440 align:start position:0%
it's a late Bill and we're not dealing
 
07:24:19.368 --> 07:24:19.378 align:start position:0%
with it a month ago but um as amended
 
07:24:20.810 --> 07:24:20.820 align:start position:0%
there's probably pretty significant
 
07:24:23.330 --> 07:24:23.340 align:start position:0%
costs and a we don't know what they are
 
07:24:26.330 --> 07:24:26.340 align:start position:0%
B we have no funding mechanism for it so
 
07:24:26.340 --> 07:24:27.048 align:start position:0%
B we have no funding mechanism for it so
that

07:24:27.048 --> 07:24:27.058 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:24:29.990 --> 07:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
could be termed an unfunded mandate but
 
07:24:32.570 --> 07:24:32.580 align:start position:0%
um certainly the cost of this amended
 
07:24:34.250 --> 07:24:34.260 align:start position:0%
bill is much higher than the cost of the
 
07:24:36.110 --> 07:24:36.120 align:start position:0%
original Bill and that's uh probably
 
07:24:39.288 --> 07:24:39.298 align:start position:0%
cause for concern right there thanks any
 
07:24:41.270 --> 07:24:41.280 align:start position:0%
other comments
 
07:24:43.490 --> 07:24:43.500 align:start position:0%
oh yes representative thank you for
 
07:24:45.590 --> 07:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
taking my my comment
 
07:24:47.810 --> 07:24:47.820 align:start position:0%
um you know as we listen we've been
 
07:24:49.910 --> 07:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
listening to this about maybe half of
 
07:24:53.448 --> 07:24:53.458 align:start position:0%
the day and I think that the state of
 
07:24:55.968 --> 07:24:55.978 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire does not act alone on
 
07:24:55.978 --> 07:24:57.170 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire does not act alone on
educational

07:24:57.170 --> 07:24:57.180 align:start position:0%
educational
 
07:24:57.180 --> 07:24:57.788 align:start position:0%
educational
um

07:24:57.788 --> 07:24:57.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:25:00.708 --> 07:25:00.718 align:start position:0%
Administration what about the feds what
 
07:25:02.930 --> 07:25:02.940 align:start position:0%
do the feds say about you know New
 
07:25:06.170 --> 07:25:06.180 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's commissioner using subpoenas
 
07:25:06.180 --> 07:25:07.368 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's commissioner using subpoenas
um

07:25:07.368 --> 07:25:07.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:25:10.490 --> 07:25:10.500 align:start position:0%
is there a danger of that
 
07:25:13.610 --> 07:25:13.620 align:start position:0%
doing so could violate
 
07:25:16.070 --> 07:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
American with Disabilities Act if the
 
07:25:17.868 --> 07:25:17.878 align:start position:0%
student is disabled or the teacher is
 
07:25:22.788 --> 07:25:22.798 align:start position:0%
disabled so you know I think that more
 
07:25:25.250 --> 07:25:25.260 align:start position:0%
study needs to go into this Bill thank
 
07:25:28.250 --> 07:25:28.260 align:start position:0%
you all right any other comments all
 
07:25:28.260 --> 07:25:29.330 align:start position:0%
you all right any other comments all
right yes

07:25:29.330 --> 07:25:29.340 align:start position:0%
right yes
 
07:25:32.750 --> 07:25:32.760 align:start position:0%
I believe I I just very briefly
 
07:25:35.150 --> 07:25:35.160 align:start position:0%
I get the point that we could quash a
 
07:25:37.128 --> 07:25:37.138 align:start position:0%
subpoena through the court I mean with
 
07:25:38.750 --> 07:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
with respect but there's huge
 
07:25:40.548 --> 07:25:40.558 align:start position:0%
transaction costs associated with that
 
07:25:41.990 --> 07:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
does someone actually have to do that
 
07:25:43.910 --> 07:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
and I think we may sit here and say a
 
07:25:46.490 --> 07:25:46.500 align:start position:0%
subpoena might be a dead letter compound
 
07:25:48.890 --> 07:25:48.900 align:start position:0%
sand but I think maybe someone who
 
07:25:50.390 --> 07:25:50.400 align:start position:0%
received that subpoeno is on the
 
07:25:51.590 --> 07:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
receiving end of that from a government
 
07:25:54.708 --> 07:25:54.718 align:start position:0%
agency might be concerned the other
 
07:25:57.948 --> 07:25:57.958 align:start position:0%
point I think is worth making is to my
 
07:26:00.410 --> 07:26:00.420 align:start position:0%
understanding we would be the only state
 
07:26:03.288 --> 07:26:03.298 align:start position:0%
that would allow this to occur at this
 
07:26:05.208 --> 07:26:05.218 align:start position:0%
phase that during or in the course of
 
07:26:06.410 --> 07:26:06.420 align:start position:0%
Investigation whatever the exact
 
07:26:08.390 --> 07:26:08.400 align:start position:0%
languages I believe it may be
 
07:26:10.850 --> 07:26:10.860 align:start position:0%
permissible in the context of a hearing
 
07:26:13.070 --> 07:26:13.080 align:start position:0%
where someone's license is up for uh
 
07:26:15.350 --> 07:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
termination or revocation
 
07:26:17.510 --> 07:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
but this seems to
 
07:26:20.750 --> 07:26:20.760 align:start position:0%
be ahead of or behind or depending how
 
07:26:23.208 --> 07:26:23.218 align:start position:0%
you look at it what other states are
 
07:26:26.330 --> 07:26:26.340 align:start position:0%
doing I'm not sure where you get that
 
07:26:28.610 --> 07:26:28.620 align:start position:0%
from representative page I'm not I I I
 
07:26:31.128 --> 07:26:31.138 align:start position:0%
just I don't know the I'm not I'm not
 
07:26:32.628 --> 07:26:32.638 align:start position:0%
saying that there you know that all
 
07:26:34.190 --> 07:26:34.200 align:start position:0%
other states allow this I just don't
 
07:26:36.948 --> 07:26:36.958 align:start position:0%
know but I'm not sure it's uh I'm not
 
07:26:36.958 --> 07:26:37.968 align:start position:0%
know but I'm not sure it's uh I'm not
sure

07:26:37.968 --> 07:26:37.978 align:start position:0%
sure
 
07:26:40.128 --> 07:26:40.138 align:start position:0%
I mean where are you getting it that no
 
07:26:42.468 --> 07:26:42.478 align:start position:0%
other states have this I I said I
 
07:26:44.330 --> 07:26:44.340 align:start position:0%
believe and I think we had testimony
 
07:26:46.850 --> 07:26:46.860 align:start position:0%
from one of the um
 
07:26:49.368 --> 07:26:49.378 align:start position:0%
uh I can't remember who it was when I
 
07:26:50.330 --> 07:26:50.340 align:start position:0%
asked that question I thought it was
 
07:26:51.890 --> 07:26:51.900 align:start position:0%
maybe Mr Hawkins who's here and I
 
07:26:53.390 --> 07:26:53.400 align:start position:0%
thought all he said was he didn't he
 
07:26:55.010 --> 07:26:55.020 align:start position:0%
just didn't know I mean if I'm wrong if
 
07:26:56.750 --> 07:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong on that Mr Hawkins and you do
 
07:26:58.670 --> 07:26:58.680 align:start position:0%
know then please that you know educate
 
07:26:58.680 --> 07:27:07.190 align:start position:0%
know then please that you know educate
us

07:27:07.190 --> 07:27:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:27:09.530 --> 07:27:09.540 align:start position:0%
so was it correct I mean so is it
 
07:27:10.730 --> 07:27:10.740 align:start position:0%
correct to say that at least right now
 
07:27:13.968 --> 07:27:13.978 align:start position:0%
 
07:27:16.190 --> 07:27:16.200 align:start position:0%
so we don't okay we don't no that's all
 
07:27:19.070 --> 07:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
I'm saying yeah we don't know we don't
 
07:27:20.690 --> 07:27:20.700 align:start position:0%
know so I but I don't think it's fair to
 
07:27:22.310 --> 07:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
say that you know that other other
 
07:27:23.570 --> 07:27:23.580 align:start position:0%
states don't have this we just don't
 
07:27:25.490 --> 07:27:25.500 align:start position:0%
know but but isn't it important these
 
07:27:27.890 --> 07:27:27.900 align:start position:0%
are questions that are so important to
 
07:27:30.410 --> 07:27:30.420 align:start position:0%
know before we move forward
 
07:27:33.650 --> 07:27:33.660 align:start position:0%
why well I mean not just do other states
 
07:27:35.628 --> 07:27:35.638 align:start position:0%
do it but just this the whole due
 
07:27:37.610 --> 07:27:37.620 align:start position:0%
process and narrowing the scope and
 
07:27:39.650 --> 07:27:39.660 align:start position:0%
putting guardrails on and how you're
 
07:27:41.270 --> 07:27:41.280 align:start position:0%
going to quash it what is the criteria
 
07:27:44.150 --> 07:27:44.160 align:start position:0%
to cross it all that type of stuff
 
07:27:45.830 --> 07:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
yeah representative Wallace thank you Mr
 
07:27:49.010 --> 07:27:49.020 align:start position:0%
chair colleagues the way I read the bill
 
07:27:50.948 --> 07:27:50.958 align:start position:0%
um as representative Tripp pointed out
 
07:27:53.510 --> 07:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
uh for the purpose of carrying out
 
07:27:56.810 --> 07:27:56.820 align:start position:0%
investigations pursuant to the code of
 
07:27:59.270 --> 07:27:59.280 align:start position:0%
conduct of New Hampshire Educators that
 
07:28:01.010 --> 07:28:01.020 align:start position:0%
sets some pretty
 
07:28:03.350 --> 07:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
uh well-defined boundaries the way I
 
07:28:05.868 --> 07:28:05.878 align:start position:0%
read it again I'm not an attorney and
 
07:28:09.048 --> 07:28:09.058 align:start position:0%
and this is also been approved and ruled
 
07:28:10.850 --> 07:28:10.860 align:start position:0%
germane by the speaker and the clerk of
 
07:28:13.910 --> 07:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
the of the house so this is the right
 
07:28:15.830 --> 07:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
committee for this bill to be heard at
 
07:28:17.868 --> 07:28:17.878 align:start position:0%
this particular time
 
07:28:21.770 --> 07:28:21.780 align:start position:0%
um and uh the educator did excuse me the
 
07:28:24.288 --> 07:28:24.298 align:start position:0%
investigator did say that this would be
 
07:28:26.930 --> 07:28:26.940 align:start position:0%
used at the end of the process should it
 
07:28:29.150 --> 07:28:29.160 align:start position:0%
be needed and that in his words and I
 
07:28:32.208 --> 07:28:32.218 align:start position:0%
quote we will not be casting this out as
 
07:28:34.548 --> 07:28:34.558 align:start position:0%
a fishing Expedition or as a fishing net
 
07:28:35.868 --> 07:28:35.878 align:start position:0%
if you will
 
07:28:37.070 --> 07:28:37.080 align:start position:0%
um it's only going to be these
 
07:28:39.650 --> 07:28:39.660 align:start position:0%
situations and the anecdote he used was
 
07:28:43.750 --> 07:28:43.760 align:start position:0%
uh there was three principles involved
 
07:28:46.070 --> 07:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
in a particular investigation he was
 
07:28:48.530 --> 07:28:48.540 align:start position:0%
conducting to provided some help one
 
07:28:50.750 --> 07:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
didn't and that's when they would
 
07:28:52.730 --> 07:28:52.740 align:start position:0%
actually exercise
 
07:28:54.830 --> 07:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
um the option to seek The subpoena to
 
07:28:56.868 --> 07:28:56.878 align:start position:0%
get that information
 
07:29:00.288 --> 07:29:00.298 align:start position:0%
um I trust our investigations I I trust
 
07:29:01.788 --> 07:29:01.798 align:start position:0%
our state police to do the right thing
 
07:29:03.948 --> 07:29:03.958 align:start position:0%
and I trust this individual he's been
 
07:29:07.128 --> 07:29:07.138 align:start position:0%
stay true before in some capacity for 40
 
07:29:10.310 --> 07:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
years I don't believe he's the problem
 
07:29:13.788 --> 07:29:13.798 align:start position:0%
other any other comment on the on the
 
07:29:16.010 --> 07:29:16.020 align:start position:0%
amendment so let me ask let me ask you
 
07:29:19.610 --> 07:29:19.620 align:start position:0%
this I I mean I'm I'm clearly reading
 
07:29:21.048 --> 07:29:21.058 align:start position:0%
the room that there's going to be a
 
07:29:23.030 --> 07:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
strong disagreement on whether the Bills
 
07:29:25.250 --> 07:29:25.260 align:start position:0%
should pass my my initial question
 
07:29:28.610 --> 07:29:28.620 align:start position:0%
though is do you want to have a roll
 
07:29:30.468 --> 07:29:30.478 align:start position:0%
call vote on the amendment or can we
 
07:29:32.090 --> 07:29:32.100 align:start position:0%
just do that by show of hands and then
 
07:29:35.150 --> 07:29:35.160 align:start position:0%
we will have a roll call vote on the on
 
07:29:37.430 --> 07:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
the uh on the bill itself
 
07:29:42.230 --> 07:29:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:29:44.930 --> 07:29:44.940 align:start position:0%
it does you know this this amendment
 
07:29:47.448 --> 07:29:47.458 align:start position:0%
replaces the the building
 
07:29:49.070 --> 07:29:49.080 align:start position:0%
okay all right then let's have her all
 
07:29:50.448 --> 07:29:50.458 align:start position:0%
right so anybody else have anything else
 
07:29:52.610 --> 07:29:52.620 align:start position:0%
they want to say
 
07:29:55.010 --> 07:29:55.020 align:start position:0%
all right seeing nothing so we'll take a
 
07:29:57.250 --> 07:29:57.260 align:start position:0%
roll call vote on Amendment
 
07:29:57.260 --> 07:30:00.850 align:start position:0%

the underlying Bill obviously there was
 
07:31:02.090 --> 07:31:02.100 align:start position:0%
a reason for an amendment right uh to
 
07:31:03.230 --> 07:31:03.240 align:start position:0%
replace all
 
07:31:05.150 --> 07:31:05.160 align:start position:0%
and there seems to be some agreement
 
07:31:07.788 --> 07:31:07.798 align:start position:0%
that we could come up with something if
 
07:31:11.208 --> 07:31:11.218 align:start position:0%
we pow-wowed long enough to
 
07:31:13.730 --> 07:31:13.740 align:start position:0%
come up with something I move that we
 
07:31:15.048 --> 07:31:15.058 align:start position:0%
retain the bill
 
07:31:15.058 --> 07:31:16.368 align:start position:0%
retain the bill
and

07:31:16.368 --> 07:31:16.378 align:start position:0%

07:31:18.590 --> 07:31:18.600 align:start position:0%
see what representative testerman and
 
07:31:21.948 --> 07:31:21.958 align:start position:0%
Smith can come up with right is there a
 
07:31:21.958 --> 07:31:23.350 align:start position:0%

yes representative
 
07:31:44.448 --> 07:31:44.458 align:start position:0%

um be reintroduced as a separate piece
 
07:31:49.910 --> 07:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
of legislation that my guess would be
 
07:31:53.030 --> 07:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
given to a different committee so no all
 
07:31:55.190 --> 07:31:55.200 align:start position:0%
right anyone else wish to speak to the
 
07:31:57.770 --> 07:31:57.780 align:start position:0%
