00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Thank you.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Thank you.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Thank you.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Thank you.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,500
Welcome to the October 7th meeting of the Science, Technology and Energy Committee.

6
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:22,000
We will start a work session on five interim study bills in just a moment.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:33,000
But first, as is our custom, let's all rise and join Representative McGee as she leads us in the Pledge of Allegiance.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation of their God, indivisibleible with liberty and justice for all.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So, ST&E retained five bills for interim study in its 2024 session, the earlier part of our session.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,500
And so, we have to pass judgment on what to do with those five bills.

11
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,000
Now we have two choices.

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:20,500
One is we can judge that a bill is recommended for future legislation, or two, we can recommend that it's not recommended for future legislation.

13
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:26,500
Now, whichever one of those recommendations we make are not actually binding.

14
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:41,500
A legislator could file a bill, even if the interim study bill on which his bill was based, his or her bill was based, was judged to be not recommended.

15
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:50,500
Likewise, someone, even if a bill is recommended for future legislation, that doesn't require someone to file it.

16
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:57,500
And in fact, it may never get filed as a result of that recommendation.

17
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:03,000
So these recommendations are not binding, but they are just guiding.

18
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:26,500
They provide guidance for future legislators to decide, well, let's see, if I want to file a bill based on this and it was recommended for future legislation, I might have better luck getting it through the legislature than if it was not recommended for future legislation.

19
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:30,500
So it's basically a guide for the future.

20
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:38,500
So with that said, are there any questions or comments about the process here this morning?

21
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:56,000
What I would like to do is just go through each bill in the order that they're listed in the calendar and have a discussion about whether the bill has any pros or any cons.

22
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,500
Just get a sense of what people would like to do.

23
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:06,000
We're not going to vote on bills this morning.

24
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
We're going to wait until one o'clock this afternoon to do that.

25
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:21,500
But I would like everybody to chime in and give us your thoughts and your feelings about each bill.

26
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:33,500
The one thing that we do have to supply at the end of the day today is a report on each of these bills.

27
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:50,000
Whether we recommend for future legislation or not recommend for future legislation, we have to have a two, three, four sentence report that can be published in the House calendar about each bill.

28
00:03:50,000 --> 00:04:05,500
That's to satisfy one of our House rules that says that every bill submitted to the legislature gets a fair hearing and is subject to the judgment of the general court.

29
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:10,000
So this is basically a fulfillment of that requirement.

30
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:19,500
We have given the bill a fair hearing and we have determined either to recommend or not recommend it.

31
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,500
So with that prelude, let's jump right in.

32
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:33,500
And what I'm going to do is I'm going to announce the number of the bill and read its title.

33
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:47,500
And then I'm going to turn it over to our House clerk, who, as you will recall, took extensive notes about each bill when we heard it originally.

34
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:53,000
And he's going to read the, what did you call it?

35
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:02,500
Statement of intent for each bill, so that we will know just exactly what the bill was intended for.

36
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,500
So we'll start with...

37
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:12,500
for each bill so that we will know just exactly what the bill was intended for.

38
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:22,000
So we'll start with House Bill 509 relative to the phasing out of the minimum electric renewable portfolio standard.

39
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
So Mr.

40
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,500
Clerk, let's hear the statement of intent.

41
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:33,000
The future of the renewable portfolio standard remains ambiguous beyond 2025.

42
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Should it be retained or eliminated?

43
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:44,000
How long does a program need to be in place for it to be considered effective?

44
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
What constitutes effectiveness for such programs?

45
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:54,500
These kinds of questions need further analysis that a referral to an interim study provides.

46
00:05:54,500 --> 00:06:00,000
Okay, so that's why we referred this bill to interim study.

47
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:14,500
We could choose to debate the questions in the statement of intent, or we could just choose to make a judgment about what to do with the bill today.

48
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:23,500
I personally would prefer the latter, to make a judgment on what to do with the bill today.

49
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:39,000
But if there is an intense desire to study the bill, we could do that for a couple of weeks before we have to finish it and wrap up our recommendation.

50
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:46,000
So I'd like to hear from the members about what their feelings might be.

51
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Representative Arrington.

52
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Yeah.

53
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I mean, let's just start with a little bit of history here.

54
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
It's been, I don't know how many years.

55
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I think Al Gore made his famous speech about the end of the world coming in 10 years.

56
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:15,000
That was about 16, 17 years ago, and the world hasn't ended.

57
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,500
So everybody's been inundated with global warming, climate change.

58
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:29,500
Nobody in New Hampshire, unless they're literally living underground someplace, is unaware of all the information available on climate change.

59
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:45,500
Given that, I don't think beyond 2025, we should make the assumption that the people of New Hampshire are too ignorant to make a decision on what type of electricity to buy.

60
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:55,000
They can buy whatever they want, and we should allow them the freedom to make that decision for themselves.

61
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:17,500
A little more historical thing, people may or may not know, there's actually a law on the books that says utilities must provide up to 100% renewable energy if requested by a customer, and the customer has to pay any additional costs associated with that.

62
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,500
That law was suspended.

63
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:25,500
There was provision to suspend it if there was lack of participation.

64
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:35,000
When the law was in effect, 0.2%, that 0.2% of people opted to pay extra to get renewable energy.

65
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:45,500
Now, subsequent to that, there's been more available options for competitive suppliers, some of which provide all wind energy or whatever.

66
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:55,500
So there's really no need for the state to say, you're not smart enough to make a decision for yourself.

67
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:01,500
We're going to force you to buy the right type of electricity.

68
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,000
This is simply a matter of freedom.

69
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
No one out there is ignorant.

70
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:19,500
No one can say, well, they don't know anything about the need for renewable energy because we constantly get bombarded with that information.

71
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,500
It's everywhere you turn.

72
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:36,000
So I think it's time to tell the people of New Hampshire, yes, we recognize you're intelligent enough to make a decision on what type of electricity to buy.

73
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:49,500
Just like we say, we don't say, well, you have to buy a certain percentage of your produce must be organically grown because it's healthier for you.

74
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:58,500
Or a certain percentage of the milk you buy must be skim milk because that's healthier for you.

75
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:02,500
We let these people make their own decisions.

76
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:06,500
They can do it with electricity as well.

77
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,500
Okay.

78
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,000
Question for you, Representative Harrington.

79
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Was the phase out of the original bill a five-year phase out?

80
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,500
Is that what you recommended?

81
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:57,500
Yeah, I believe it was because even though I don't think anybody that gets government subsidies has a right to those subsidies, but in trying to be a little bit fairer, it would be if you were getting the subsidies now, this phase out would allow you to make plans for the future so you could market yourself to people just the way other products do rather than lobbying at the state house for additional subsidies.

82
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:02,000
So that was the purpose of the five-year phase-out.

83
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:13,500
Was there any provision in the bill for grandfathering people who had installed renewable energy based on the provisions of the program earlier?

84
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,500
No.

85
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:38,000
Again, anybody that receives a subsidy from the government should not say, well, since you're giving me $20 for a subsidy, forcing to take it from the rate payers and giving it to me, you don't have a right to continue to get that forever.

86
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,500
There was never any commitment.

87
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:55,000
There was never anything in the bill that said, okay, if you put in renewable energy and you qualify for the RPS, we will pay you forever on it.

88
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
That was never stated.

89
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:03,000
In fact, the bill had a phase-out time, built with it, 2025.

90
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:10,000
And I think that this is even a little bit more generous than that.

91
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:18,000
But again, because you're getting a subsidy doesn't mean you have a right to the subsidy.

92
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,500
That's a decision that can be made.

93
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:27,000
It can be granted and be taken away by the state.

94
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:36,500
And the bill did restore the requirement that the utilities offer 100% renewable resource-generated power if customers wanted that?

95
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:40,000
Yes, I believe that was in there.

96
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:46,000
It just basically, what happened was the utilities jointly petitioned the PUC.

97
00:12:46,000 --> 00:13:08,500
I was on the commission at the time, and they brought forward that the administrative costs of that particular program where people could request up to the 100% renewable energy, that was borne by the ratepayers, not by the people who selected the renewable energy.

98
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:18,000
Any additional cost associated with the procurement of the renewable energy was borne by the person who requested it.

99
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:26,000
But they came forward to us and said, look, 0.2% of the people are requesting this.

100
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:34,500
The administrative costs are so high, and we can't justify them based on the small participation rate.

101
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:41,000
And since the law allow the PUC to suspend it, it was suspended.

102
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Okay.

103
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Additional...

104
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,500
them based on this small participation rate.

105
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:55,000
And since the law allowed the PUC to suspend it, it was suspended.

106
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Okay.

107
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Additional comments about this.

108
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Representative McGee.

109
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Thank you, Mr.

110
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Chair.

111
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:24,000
So my understanding is the renewable portfolio standards came into being as a way for the state to sort of keep track of how we were doing in terms of adoption of local sustainable, cleaner sources of energy.

112
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:42,500
And that was in part because we had plans we were trying to make available to businesses and to individuals about how the state was addressing the need to lower our emissions and dependence on fossil fuels.

113
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:57,500
So the Renewable Portfolio Standard, as it stands, as I think the chairman alluded to, the program provides price signals in the market for various categories of energy, including hydro.

114
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:10,500
There are a number of impacts that would happen from this phase out to the economics of clean energy sources that we have in the state.

115
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:36,500
And that's the reason that I would probably, on this bill, I would vote not to recommend that it go forward because I think there is a lot more of an analysis about what the impact is to people who have made plans around the fact that the state has an RPS.

116
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:54,000
And I realize that additional legislation is likely to come because we have an end date on the existing RPS statute of 2025, with a goal of 25% of our energy being from renewable sources.

117
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
So I think we do need to address this issue.

118
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:19,500
But I think this concept of phasing it out without analyzing what that will do to the markets and what that will do to businesses and what that will do to people who are operating clean energy operations in New Hampshire.

119
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:24,000
I don't think we want to disincentivize them either.

120
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:37,000
So I don't feel there's been enough information on the economics of the effects of what would happen if we decided to phase the program out.

121
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,500
So that's what I think.

122
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,500
Okay.

123
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,500
Additional comments.

124
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,500
Representative Kaplan.

125
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:49,500
Yeah, I just want to thank you, Mr.

126
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,500
Chair.

127
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:55,500
I just want to concur with Representative McGee.

128
00:16:55,500 --> 00:17:13,000
I think that going forward with this bill without an analysis would be foolhardy in terms of the economic impact on the state and the businesses that are already involved in the clean energy transition.

129
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:36,000
But I also think that we need to look at the purpose of the RPS, which is to bring on more clean energy in order to transition us away from our dependence on fossil fuels because of the impact of burning fossil fuels on the climate.

130
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,500
That's a very real thing.

131
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:55,500
And to question that is, you know, is to deny the science, the consensus on the need to do that in order to, you know, save us from the worst impacts of climate change.

132
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:59,000
So I just wanted to mention that.

133
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Okay.

134
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Additional comments?

135
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Representative Reynolds.

136
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Thank you, Mr.

137
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Chairman.

138
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Just want to chime in and support my ranking member and my fellow member, Representative Kaplan.

139
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
The Renewable Portfolio Standard is longstanding public policy.

140
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:29,500
New Hampshire's one of something like 34, 35, two-thirds of states in the United States have one.

141
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:35,000
It's public policy, prudent policy to diversify this state's energy resources.

142
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,500
New Hampshire has no native fossil fuels.

143
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:43,500
The only native energy sources we have are renewable sources.

144
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:55,500
And so we should do nothing to reduce incentives and support for further development of renewable energy resources because they strengthen the state economically.

145
00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:00,500
So I also would not support moving this bill forward.

146
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,500
Representative McWilliams, nice to see you.

147
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,500
Good to see you as well.

148
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,500
Thank you, Chair Boz.

149
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:26,500
I just wanted to make a quick comment that we have existing biomass facilities that are both county and state-owned that would be impacted by the removal of the RPS because of their biomass right now.

150
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:39,500
That is a business impact on what we're concerned about, big picture, federal, state, and local county-owned facilities that right now are benefiting from the RPS.

151
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:52,500
And we really should look at that, I think, in a little bit more granularity before just pulling the rug out from underneath those business cases.

152
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,500
Thank you.

153
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,500
Representative Harrington.

154
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:01,000
Yeah, just a couple of quick replies to that.

155
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:11,500
First, obviously, any company that's getting a subsidy from ratepayers or taxpayers is going to complain when the subsidy goes away.

156
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:15,000
That doesn't mean it should be perpetual.

157
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:29,000
This was set with an end limit to allow renewable energy to grow and to educate the people on the need for that, both of which have happened.

158
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Thank you.

159
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
it should be perpetual.

160
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:47,000
This was set with an end limit to allow renewable energy to grow and to educate the people on the need for that, both of which have happened.

161
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,500
We cannot just go on forever with the subsidies.

162
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:57,000
It's response to what counties may have something of doing this.

163
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Well, the people in my county shouldn't have to pay higher electric rates to subsidize some other county.

164
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,500
It's simply not their responsibility.

165
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:12,500
Let the county pay for their own cost.

166
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:24,000
The other part about this is we talk about, you know, our renewable energy in the state, we don't have any fossil fuels.

167
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:39,500
Well, the switch from coal and oil to natural gas accounted for almost 95% of the reduction in carbon dioxide emissions in New England over the last 10 or 15 years.

168
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:59,500
So using natural gas is a much cleaner source that we should be looking at making that happen with more pipelines or at least getting rid of the Jones Act so we can get an LNG from the United States.

169
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:38,500
But the renewable energy source we want to look at, as Luke mentioned, wood, well, we just, there was a settlement just made, maybe you're aware of this, but the biomass plant in Berlin went bankrupt because they could not get another, I think it would have been their third extension for not having to live up to the terms of the contract that they not only signed, but they pursued with Eversource that was public service then.

170
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:43,000
Now, that bankruptcy left the ratepayers owed $160 million.

171
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:52,500
So this is what happens when the government gets involved in the markets and tries to artificially set prices.

172
00:22:52,500 --> 00:23:02,000
It's $160 million that the ratepayers paid to that biomass facility that they're never going to see back again.

173
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:12,500
And you might also know, how did they use some of that $160 million that they were paid over market rates?

174
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:20,000
They hired very expensive lobbyists to come down here to lobby for more ratepayer subsidies.

175
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:29,500
So basically, that bill forced the ratepayers to pay for people to raise the subsidies that they were paying.

176
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:34,000
That's what happens when the government interferes with markets.

177
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,500
We had a plan, ended in 2025.

178
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,000
Everybody knows about renewable energy.

179
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,500
Anyone can go out and buy it if they want to.

180
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:49,500
There's nothing that stops them from doing it.

181
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,500
It's available.

182
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:55,500
Just look on the internet under the PUC.

183
00:23:55,500 --> 00:24:00,000
There's simply no need to extend this subsidy forever.

184
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Who's next?

185
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Representative Korman.

186
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Thank you, Mr.

187
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Chairman.

188
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:21,500
Representative Reynolds said something that I was thinking at that moment, which is actually harking back to something that you had been pointing out and advocating, Mr.

189
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:25,000
Chairman, and that's New Hampshire energy independence.

190
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,500
And we don't produce the fossil fuels.

191
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:32,000
We don't produce coal, oil, natural gas.

192
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:43,500
If we are going to move toward energy independence, it's going to have to be with renewable energy that we produce in state.

193
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:47,500
So I think we should be supporting it.

194
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:51,500
Another possibility there might be small modular nuclear.

195
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:55,500
So that's something we should keep in mind.

196
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,500
We get regular reports every year.

197
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:11,500
I'm sure every member of this committee gets them in their email inbox from the Department of Energy tracking the previous year's implementation of the RPS.

198
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:15,000
So we know how much it costs.

199
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
And we also, individually, I'm sure, get completed.

200
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
tracking the previous year's implementation of the RPS.

201
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,500
So we know how much it costs.

202
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:34,500
And we also individually, I'm sure, get complaints from constituents about the high cost of electricity.

203
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:45,000
And the RPS, according to the reports we get every year, costs ratepayers something like $55 million, $60 million every year.

204
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:57,000
And phasing out the RPS would be something that I think ratepayers would be in favor of because it would lower their electric costs.

205
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,500
So that's something to keep in mind as well.

206
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:04,000
Further comments on this bill?

207
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Representative Kaplan?

208
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Yeah.

209
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Thank you, Mr.

210
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Chair.

211
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I think that's a good point.

212
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:22,000
And as Representative McGee pointed out, the RPS is slated to end in 2025.

213
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:38,000
And so I think, I don't know if we can do this as a recommendation, but I think a study committee on the future of the RPS would be a good idea.

214
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:46,500
Actually, my reading of the legislation on RSA 362F indicates that it doesn't actually end in 2025.

215
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:55,000
It just does not go beyond 2025 in terms of increasing the amounts of renewable energy required.

216
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:00,000
It basically levels off at 25% and then stays there.

217
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,500
It doesn't increase or decrease.

218
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:18,500
And I think part of what Representative Harrington was driving at with the submission of this bill was rather than leave it be level, maybe it's time to start tapering it off.

219
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:29,500
And that Representative Kaplan might be a good subject to look at in a study committee regarding the future of the RPS.

220
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:49,000
Another question that the statement of intent that Representative Bernardi read to us a little while ago said that it's important for programs like this that we try to make a judgment about whether it's been effective or not.

221
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Did it work?

222
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,500
Did it do what we wanted it to do?

223
00:27:55,500 --> 00:28:08,000
And that might be the subject for some study of the RPS to determine, did it really do accomplish what we wanted it to accomplish.

224
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
It was passed back in 2007.

225
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
I think it went into effect around 2008.

226
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:24,000
So we have a pretty good period of time by which we could evaluate its success or failure.

227
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Representative Harrington.

228
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Yeah, I think the easiest way to do that, I don't have the figures in front of me, but the easiest way to determine if it was a success or a failure was to look at the alternate compliance payments.

229
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
How high are they?

230
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,500
They continue to go down.

231
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:58,500
I mean, the goal of the program was to put the alternate compliance payments at zero.

232
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:07,000
As you said, this has now been, I don't know, 15, 20 years or something like that.

233
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:22,000
And over that amount of time, with this amount of incentive, you would have thought if the market was there, that the alternate compliance payments would have gone to zero.

234
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,500
I don't think they have.

235
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:27,500
I don't know what they are.

236
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:46,000
But if you want to know the effectiveness of it, compare how much is actually generating renewable electricity and how much is going to alternate compliance payments to be distributed out as a form of more subsidies.

237
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Representative McGee?

238
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:53,000
I'd love to try and put a cap on this.

239
00:29:53,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Okay, what strikes me is that we're talking about a lot of different things that we all feel and think.

240
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:17,500
I think part of the goal of the RPS was to have a review of whether or not we were also lowering emissions by adopting additional clean energy sources.

241
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:27,500
We're not all aligned on this committee that we would be looking at that as an outcome or a goal.

242
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:44,500
So rather than do that, maybe let's get back to the business at hand, which is, do we recommend this for further legislation or are we not going to recommend it for further legislation?

243
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:52,000
Because I think we've talked about our perspective on all of the issues Thank you.

244
00:30:52,000 --> 00:31:01,000
do we recommend this for further legislation or are we not going to recommend it for further legislation?

245
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:07,500
Because I think we've talked about our perspective on all of the issues.

246
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:13,000
Well, I don't think we have to make that call now.

247
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,500
We'll make that call in executive session.

248
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:22,500
What I wanted to do here is just have a good discussion.

249
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,500
Representative Bernardi?

250
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:32,500
yes mr chairman we We do need a vote on whatever motion we're going to take.

251
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:40,500
It's not the binding vote of the executive session, but it's a vote on the motion.

252
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:43,000
At least by the force.

253
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,500
So somebody needs to make a motion?

254
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:49,000
Is that what you're saying?

255
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:56,500
We need to make a motion on either recommend for future legislation or not recommend.

256
00:31:56,500 --> 00:32:01,500
That needs to be seconded and we need a vote.

257
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:05,000
I'd like to make a motion then.

258
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:12,500
I'd like to make a motion that we not recommend this bill for the legislation.

259
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,500
Is there a second?

260
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,500
Second.

261
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,500
Okay.

262
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:21,000
There's a couple of them.

263
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:27,000
So now, can we do this by voice vote or raising hands?

264
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Do we have to do a roll call?

265
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Mr.

266
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Chairman, point of order.

267
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Yes.

268
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
I'm not sure what we're doing.

269
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,000
I mean, this is not an executive session.

270
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
No, it isn't.

271
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
But we have a form here.

272
00:32:49,000 --> 00:33:14,500
You're welcome to look at it it it says subcommittee work session on hb 509 i should put my glasses on and then it um it has a motion section and it apparently wants us to vote now i i didn't know that this was a requirement of a work session.

273
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:27,500
I guess my question would be, if we're going to vote on this now, what are we going to be voting on in the executive session?

274
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:32,500
Well, I was told that this vote is not binding.

275
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:36,000
So I guess it's a straw vote.

276
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:44,000
That's why I think we could do it by raising hands rather than a roll call.

277
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,500
So it's basically just a straw vote.

278
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:56,000
So on the motion of not recommended for future legislation, all those in favor, raise your hand.

279
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
10.

280
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:03,500
Okay, so there's 10 that vote in favor of that motion.

281
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:07,000
And all those opposed, raise your hand.

282
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
One, two, three, four.

283
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Four that are opposed.

284
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,000
So 10 to four, but it's not binding.

285
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,000
So we'll do it again during executive session.

286
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Okay, let's move on.

287
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Next is House Bill 1398, relative to utility recovery of costs associated with net energy metering.

288
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
So Mr.

289
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Clerk, please read us the statement of intent on House Bill 1398.

290
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:50,000
This bill sought to extend net metering cost recovery mechanism called stranded cost recovery used by the state's largest utility to New Hampshire's other regulated utilities.

291
00:34:50,000 --> 00:35:03,500
This extension was envisioned to provide trackability and transparency to net metering costs and to ensure that all customers paid those charges, not just default service customers.

292
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:19,000
The committee amended the bill to specify that the mechanism could be any non-bypassable charge if that charge appeared on the customer's bill, but the amended bill stalemated 10 to 10.

293
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:30,500
Subsequent deliberations centered around testimony that purported to claim that alternative energy suppliers and aggregators would be competitively disadvantaged by the bill's passage.

294
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:45,000
But this alleged disadvantage exists today because regulated utilities contest the notion that load settlement for net metering costs should include wholesale load reductions and or avoided transmission costs.

295
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Utilities believe that such reductions cannot be captured with current ISO New England load settlement protocols and metering.

296
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:08,500
State regulators are currently engaged in this complicated debate, so the committee ultimately decided that the bill and its subject matter be deferred for more study and future resolution.

297
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:17,500
So I'm now becoming aware that the statement of intent is basically the calendar report for a bill.

298
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,500
Is that true?

299
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,500
I believe so.

300
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,500
Yes.

301
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,500
Okay.

302
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,500
Okay.

303
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:41,500
So, obviously, the bill as introduced to the committee had the intent of having all the utilities, not just Eversource, recover net metering costs through stranded cost recovery.

304
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:45,000
It was no more complicated than that.

305
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:53,500
But the subject matter of recovering net metering costs itself is complicated, as we all well know.

306
00:36:53,500 --> 00:37:08,000
And the idea that load settlement should be part of this, I think, will probably be the subject of at least one bill that we'll see this coming session.

307
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:18,000
So this subject will be addressed and probably would obviate the need for this bill by itself to go forward.

308
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:23,500
There may be another version of this bill that comes along.

309
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,500
Who knows?

310
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:28,500
Any further discussion on this bill?

311
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,500
Representative Harrington.

312
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:39,000
Given what you just said, I'd like to make a motion that it's not for further legislation.

313
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,500
Okay, second on that motion?

314
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,500
Okay, it's seconded.

315
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:49,000
Any further discussion before we take a straw vote on this?

316
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Who seconded?

317
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Representative McGee.

318
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,500
Any further discussion before we take a straw vote?

319
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:05,000
All those in favor of not recommending this bill for future legislation, raise your hand.

320
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Any opposed?

321
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
That's a unanimous vote.

322
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Yep.

323
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,000
We can't count Doug because he walked in.

324
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,000
So our vice chair, Representative Thomas, is here.

325
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:31,500
And by the way, I forgot to welcome Representatives Horrigan and Gallagher, who are going to be sitting in during the executive session later today.

326
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:45,500
All right, so now let's move on to House Bill 1508, requiring fiber optic communication service providers to prioritize service restoration for public safety and public health organizations.

327
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:51,000
And I recognize the clerk to read the statement of intent.

328
00:38:51,000 --> 00:39:01,500
This bill requires that a provider of communication services prioritize restoration of communications for critical infrastructure over commercial and residential customers.

329
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:11,500
An issue prescribing restoration prioritization in law is that it could hinder or slow down efficient restoration for all customers.

330
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:27,500
Interim study would allow the committee to investigate alternative solutions and to better understand the issues faced by public safety and health agencies and working with communication service providers to resource service.

331
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:33,500
The prime sponsor agreed to refer to this bill to interim study.

332
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,500
Okay, Representative McGee.

333
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,500
Thank you, Mr.

334
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,500
Chair.

335
00:39:39,500 --> 00:40:08,000
I just wanted to let you know that the prime sponsor of this bill is from the north country um it's uh representative linda massamilla and she called me over the weekend because she put in the bill it originated from the chief of police in littleton who asked her um to bring this to the's attention.

336
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:15,500
And he was asking her whether he should come down and attend our work session.

337
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:24,000
And I waved her off and I said, no, it won't, that won't be worth his time.

338
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:30,500
But she did ask me to bring the recommendation that it go forward.

339
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:45,500
So that I think she wants to put it in again, but she just asked if we could, if we would consider making a recommendation that it's a worthy bill.

340
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:58,000
So do we want to actually study this bill before we make a recommendation or do we just want to go forward with a recommendation?

341
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Representative Thomas.

342
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Thank you, Mr.

343
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Chair.

344
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:19,000
I would just like to make a statement because this bill was, I kind of took this bill and pressed to have it put into interim study at the time.

345
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:29,000
What I got from the bill and from the public testimony was that we're in kind of a dichotomy here.

346
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:42,000
We're dealing with a private company that apparently was unresponsive for a significant period of time, according to the police of Chalief, the chief of police.

347
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:48,000
And the quandary was that he had no one to turn to.

348
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:55,500
He tried to contact state officials and they said, sorry, private company, not our bailiwick.

349
00:41:55,500 --> 00:42:02,000
And so what he was left with was really no point of contact.

350
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:13,500
And so he was left hanging for a couple of months at least before he could get his communications back up to speed.

351
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,500
I find that unacceptable.

352
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:51,500
And quite frankly, if that private company was here right now i would admonish them for for their lack of speed in in trying to correct the situation that that was very important to our first responders at the same time according to testimony uh it would be very difficult to try and put a bill together that would require some state agency to respond to something like this that we heard.

353
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:56,500
I still feel that we're left in a vacuum here.

354
00:42:56,500 --> 00:43:15,000
A private company dealing with a very significant resource like communications for a first responder apparently has no one to turn to if the private company decides, oh, we'll get to you in a couple of months.

355
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:19,500
I don't know what the answer is right now.

356
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:31,000
I would welcome a bill, maybe differently written, but maybe more to the point of that we might want to study next time.

357
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:43,500
But at the same time, I'm asking myself, how do we require something to be handled by the state when a private company is involved?

358
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:51,000
I really don't know the answer to that, but I do know the problem exists.

359
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:55,500
Should it happen again, who does it turn to?

360
00:43:55,500 --> 00:44:00,000
Who does the person turn to to get relief?

361
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:06,500
If not to the company's CEO, and if they're unresponsive, what happens next?

362
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:10,000
We're dealing with the first responder here.

363
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
That's my question.

364
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,500
That's the quandary I have.

365
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:19,500
Representative Munns had his hand up first, if that's okay.

366
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:21,500
Representative McGee, go ahead.

367
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:23,500
Thank you.

368
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:27,000
The bill isn't for the state agencies.

369
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:31,500
It's for the provider of the communication service, right?

370
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:48,000
So it's basically saying, let's change the rules to make sure that those people who are providing communication services prioritize, you know, emergency first responders and public safety apparatus when they are reinstating.

371
00:44:48,000 --> 00:45:10,000
So that's what the bill was trying to do was just say, if you're in this business of you're responsible for those communication lines, then you have to put those public safety agencies first in line when you're restoring an area, an area's power.

372
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,500
So that's what they were trying to get at.

373
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:20,500
And so that's what it says, a provider of communication services, right?

374
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:36,500
So I think the question of whether we can force them to do that, I mean, I think they maybe probably should already be doing that because those communication services are essential.

375
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:38,500
Right.

376
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:44,000
To trying to get the rest of it up and going.

377
00:45:44,000 --> 00:46:01,500
But but anyway, what we're just deciding whether we recommend that it should go forward, not that we have to do it, but just recommend whether it should go forward for further review or not.

378
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:05,500
We're not trying to solve it here today.

379
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:26,500
Although it is true, if you look at the substance of the bill, that it is a weak bill in the sense that it doesn't actually specify that where in the queue these public safety and public health organizations should be moved.

380
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:29,500
It also has no enforcement mechanism.

381
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:35,000
So it's a pretty weak bill from that point of view.

382
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:52,500
And while the problem is a serious problem, as you and Representative Thomas have both indicated, I'm not sure that this is the proper solution, but maybe there is a solution that might come forward.

383
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:56,000
Representative Summers, you had your hand up.

384
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Thank you, Mr.

385
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Chairman.

386
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Just to add some knowledge to this, after looking at this bill, and myself owning a network engineering company that does telecommunications services, FiberNet.

387
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:35,500
This bill is actually too generalized to even be able to push forward, being that a lot of the first responders, state-run, state facilities, and municipalities, even like hospitals and such, have to fit under what's called an E-rate, which falls under different licensing and time constraints.

388
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:39,000
They have permits they have to require.

389
00:47:39,000 --> 00:48:08,500
So it would be impossible for these facilities to be able to wait the amount of time for all of these permits, E-rate, and that to pass to meet also the budget time frame for them and to put all their other commercial and residential customers on hold while you're waiting for all of this to put them forward.

390
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:12,500
So there's just no way to do that.

391
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:17,000
So you don't think this bill is strong enough?

392
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,000
I don't think it's strong enough.

393
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:30,000
I don't think it's worded correctly, and I don't think it meets, doesn't define exactly what they're looking to do.

394
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Representative Harrington.

395
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,500
You follow up on that.

396
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:44,000
One of the problems I see with this is I'm not sure the state even has jurisdiction over Internet.

397
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,500
I know the PUC doesn't.

398
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:53,500
And it's the issue there is the FCC has the federal authority over that.

399
00:48:53,500 --> 00:49:10,000
So I'm not sure we have the ability to order a private internet company to do anything other than like with citing laws and where they put their wires on poles and such.

400
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:27,500
But as to how they run their business, I would think we should probably check with the attorney general's office or something like that and determine if we even have the authority to do it.

401
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:55,500
And second of all, I don't know the Littleton police chief at all, but I would think the best way to address this, if I was a police chief somewhere, is I would contact the cable company or the internet company or wherever you're getting your service from on a non-crisis time and get a contact.

402
00:49:55,500 --> 00:50:08,000
I'm quite sure that if you got in touch with someone there, which isn't always the easiest thing to do, that they would be responsive.

403
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:25,500
I know that the one that serves most of my district, I have a cell phone number for the guy and I can call him basically 24-7 and he gets back to me right away.

404
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:42,000
So even though there's no regulatory authority, he does understand I'm a state representative and if someone has a problem, I can call him on it and try to get it straightened out.

405
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,500
So I think there are other alternatives.

406
00:50:45,500 --> 00:51:01,500
But before we try to pass a feel good law, which this is kind of written as because it's going to have a lot more detail, you have to have some enforcement.

407
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:04,500
Who what defines these first responders?

408
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:06,500
There's no definition.

409
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:15,500
I think we should first find out, do we have the authority to even enforce anything on them?

410
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:20,500
And that's a legal question, which I simply can't answer.

411
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:22,500
Representative Corman.

412
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:24,500
Thank you, Mr.

413
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:26,500
Chairman.

414
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:38,500
First thing I want to say is put your money on the Patriots for Sunday, because I agree with what Representative Harrington just said.

415
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:41,500
I'd add a couple of things.

416
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:46,500
One is this bill is only about fiber optic communications.

417
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:53,500
There's lots of other ways of communications, and this bill doesn't even cover it.

418
00:51:53,500 --> 00:52:08,000
It also seems to me that a municipal first responder or whatever this is trying to cover really should have a backup system in case the fiber goes down.

419
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:17,000
I mean, I think this is partly on the organization for not planning to have a backup system.

420
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Good point.

421
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Representative Thomas.

422
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Thank you, Mr.

423
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Chair.

424
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:34,500
If I remember correctly during public testimony, there were some extenuating circumstances as to the good representative's point there.

425
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:53,000
I believe the police chief was informed that there was going to be work done during that period and that there would be no disruption in service to speak of, and it turned out that wasn't true.

426
00:52:53,000 --> 00:53:02,500
So perhaps he was led to believe that there wouldn't be a major delay when in fact there was.

427
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:10,000
So perhaps that might have some circumstances as to how they got into the situation.

428
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:28,500
The point I want to make is that what we're talking about now is not the merits of this bill, but whether or not the idea that further legislation may want to be introduced in the future.

429
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:40,000
And to Representative Summers' point, a bill that might be more specific or more to the point of what we're trying to do.

430
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:44,000
So I just want to make that clarification.

431
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Representative Munns.

432
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Thank you, Mr.

433
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Chair.

434
00:53:50,000 --> 00:54:00,500
My recollection from the hearing was that when all was said and done, this boiled down to a customer service issue.

435
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:06,000
And I don't know how you can legislate good customer service.

436
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:15,500
Because to Representative Harrington's point, because if we could, boy, there's a lot of areas where we could address.

437
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:35,500
So that's, I mean, I understand what Representative Thomas is saying in terms of, you know, the need for first responders to be able to get their service restored, but I just, I'm struggling with how do you do that?

438
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:39,500
How do you address a customer service issue?

439
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:42,000
You're absolutely right about that.

440
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:50,500
As we learned when we discovered all of the customer service issues in the propane industry, right?

441
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:52,500
Okay, further comments.

442
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:54,500
Representative Ploge.

443
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:56,500
Thank you, Chair.

444
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:59,500
During testimony, Department of Energy, Mr.

445
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:02,500
Robridge, was opposed to this bill.

446
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:08,500
So, Representative Doug Thomas asked him, does the companies prioritize first responders?

447
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:15,000
And the Department of Energy came back and said, yes, they do prioritize.

448
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:24,500
And elsewhere in my notes, I said to myself that this was an issue that fell between the cracks.

449
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:30,000
Anybody have a motion about what to do with this bill?

450
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Representative McGee.

451
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:39,500
Yeah, I'll make the recommendation that we do recommend some further legislation on this topic.

452
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:50,000
okay if we forward with that, would you be willing to write the report and point out the weaknesses of this?

453
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Oh, that's a bridge too far.

454
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:58,000
All right, do we have a second to that motion?

455
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:14,500
Representative Thomas seconds the motion, so we'll take a straw straw vote All those in favor of asking that this Subject matter anyway be recommended for future legislation Raise your hand Any opposed?

456
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:28,000
Three opposed, four opposed, sorry Five, remember, this is a non-binding straw vote, so you can change your mind between now and exec session if you want.

457
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Okay.

458
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
All right.

459
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Okay, let's move on to the next bill.

460
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Mr.

461
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Chairman, one question, please.

462
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Excuse me.

463
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Yes.

464
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Perhaps Representative Harrington.

465
00:56:46,000 --> 00:57:04,500
Is there a mechanism, I don't know if there's a formal one, that we could make, ask the Attorney General's office for, does the state have authority to regulate anything having to do with Internet or cable?

466
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:28,500
because I know it, I thought when I was on the commission that it was pretty clear that those items were not because when we had the telephone situation, when we went to voice over IP, that became FCC only and the state had no longer, no authority.

467
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:30,500
So Representative Summers?

468
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:32,500
I can answer that.

469
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:34,500
So it's all FCC.

470
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:43,000
It all requires a license, 498, 499, and even to get an E-rate, it's all FCC related.

471
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
So state has nothing.

472
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,500
All right, let's move on.

473
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:53,000
House Bill 1617FN relative to energy procurement agreements for default service.

474
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Mr.

475
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,500
Clerk, please read the statement of intent.

476
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:07,000
This bill commits Science, Tech, and Energy Committee to study the process of setting default service rates.

477
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:23,000
The concerns to be studied include enhancing price stability and lessening the impact of rate hikes caused by spikes in natural gas prices as these magnify the risk premium in the rates.

478
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:39,500
The committee agreed to do this in a manner that would not create a straight jacket for the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission, but rather allow them flexibility in assuring reasonable price stability.

479
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:49,000
So it is my recollection that the PUC essentially took over this study and has been doing it themselves.

480
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:55,500
So I think our committee isn't really committed to studying this any further.

481
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:57,500
Representative Thomas.

482
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:59,500
I would agree.

483
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:02,500
Any other comments on this bill?

484
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:04,500
Representative Harrington.

485
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:12,000
Only that rate making is an incredibly involved, complicated process that takes months and months.

486
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:22,000
This committee would have to do nothing for the next couple of months if we wanted to start setting rates.

487
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:28,500
And I don't know if we have the expertise to even do it.

488
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:30,500
Correct.

489
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:32,500
Representative Corman.

490
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:53,000
My notes from the work session we had back in January also said something about that we had asked Commissioner Elms whether DOE would be able to model this and that we were supposed to be getting a report from them.

491
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:57,000
I don't recall that we got this report.

492
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:08,000
I do not recall seeing such a report either, but I can double back and check with Commissioner Elms to see if...

493
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,500
You need the other one.

494
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:12,500
Yes, that's true.

495
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:26,500
Commissioner Elms is on paternity leave for some period of time, but I'm sure someone at the department will be filling in for him, so I'll contact them.

496
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:28,500
Representative McGee.

497
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:39,000
I'd like to agree with everything that's been said and make a recommendation not to recommend this bill for further legislation.

498
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:42,500
Is there a second to that motion?

499
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:44,500
Yes.

500
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:48,000
So take a straw vote on this.

501
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Who is second?

502
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Representative Thomas.

503
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
Straw vote on this.

504
01:00:54,000 --> 01:01:02,500
Everybody who would like to vote to not recommend this bill for future legislation, raise your hand.

505
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:04,500
Anybody opposed?

506
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:06,500
Looks unanimous.

507
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:22,500
All right, now let's tackle the final bill on our list, which is Senate Bill 540, which requires the Department of Energy to investigate behind the meter and utility scale energy storage.

508
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:24,500
So, Mr.

509
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:30,000
Clerk, if you could read to us the statement of intent.

510
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:37,000
This bill would study battery storage technologies for both customer and utility scale supply.

511
01:01:37,000 --> 01:02:07,500
Utility scale supply is a province of Iceland in new england and therefore not a legitimate function of the department of energy the value of understanding a customers behind the meter storage is unknown and may or not be worth investigating interim study will assess that value okay looking at my notes on this legislation, it appears to be quite vague.

512
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:23,000
For example, on line 14 of the first page of the bill, it says, there's text that says, how to best encourage both utility and non-utility investments in energy storage projects.

513
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Encourage is a pretty vague word.

514
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:30,000
This bill would cost about $250,000 to ratepayers.

515
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:34,500
Utility scale storage is an ISO New England concern.

516
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:37,500
Primary hurdles are financing and materials.

517
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:41,500
And those are not issues that require study.

518
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:45,500
Those are just fundamental issues to building batteries.

519
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:50,500
It's not government's job to encourage investments in battery storage.

520
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:53,500
Somebody else has to do that.

521
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:56,500
Somebody has to own these things.

522
01:02:56,500 --> 01:03:03,500
And as I indicated initially, the requirements of the study are just too vague.

523
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:25,000
And another thing that's not acknowledged in this bill is that one of the major hurdles to utility-scale battery storage is the fact that it costs a lot of money to build these things, and they sit idle for long periods of time.

524
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:28,500
And that makes their financing extremely difficult.

525
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:32,500
And I don't know how to overcome that.

526
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:41,500
So I think this bill doesn't do the job of creating a study that can answer the question.

527
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:48,000
So I think I would recommend we don't recommend this for further study.

528
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Other comments?

529
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
Representative Corman.

530
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Thank you, Mr.

531
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Chairman.

532
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:01,000
I actually would like to see further study on batteries.

533
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:11,500
I think that they are going to be key toward getting the three re's for energy, renewable, reliable, and reasonably priced.

534
01:04:11,500 --> 01:05:15,500
I had a conversation with Jim Andrews, president of Granite Shore Power, who we all saw at the summit a couple of weeks ago but I had a a conversation with him offline and there what they're looking to do is actually use batteries not for long-term storage but uh at Schiller and Merrimack what they plan to do is load up the batteries when energy is less expensive and then discharge the batteries into the grid at peak times which will actually be a great thing to do right they they make money doing it and it actually does the peak shaving which we all want to see in addition as you may know there's a project now in maine for 8.5 gigawatt hours of long-term storage.

535
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:18,500
Form Energy has a contract there.

536
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:27,000
And as we learned at the summit, Form Energy actually has a factory now in West Virginia.

537
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,500
They're actually building these things.

538
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:31,500
This is real.

539
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:43,500
So I think what we're going to see is that these batteries of the future are now going to be batteries of the present.

540
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:51,500
And another thing that we need to look at is how that's going to affect markets.

541
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:58,500
So when there is long-term storage, how is that going to affect electricity markets?

542
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:34,500
when Granite Shore Power is able to buy energy low and then sell it uh during peak times how is that going to affect market and is that something that the state needs to really get involved in we should at least understand it and that's one reason why i feel like this bill would be worth further study um Maybe not in the exact form, but the concept behind the bill.

543
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:36,500
Additional comments, Representative Harrington.

544
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:46,000
Yeah, you know, as I just mentioned, when the state gets involved in markets, it generally screws things up.

545
01:06:46,000 --> 01:07:01,000
We just cost the rate pay is $160 million by forcing Eversource, basically, there was a lot of political pressure, sign this contract and forcing the PUC to approve it.

546
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:07,500
I was not on the PUC when that occurred, just for the record.

547
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:15,000
I don't think we need to encourage this type or that type or anything else.

548
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:23,000
A study by the Department of Energy in New Hampshire is going to be almost meaningless.

549
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:34,000
I'm sure there's millions of federal dollars out there because they're throwing money at anything that remotely can produce energy at all.

550
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:47,500
So us spending a quarter of a million dollars to do some study on batteries isn't going to make people put in more batteries or less batteries.

551
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:57,000
As was stated, there's at least two projects in New Hampshire that are going forward now without any study.

552
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:05,000
If they operate successfully and they are financially viable, I'm sure there'll be more of them.

553
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:13,000
And no matter what our study came out with, that's going to be the determining factor.

554
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:17,500
Do the ones that have been put in work?

555
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:22,000
And if they do work, do they make money?

556
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,500
There'll be more of them.

557
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:32,000
We don't need to waste a quarter of a million dollars by doing some analysis.

558
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:40,000
I agree that we don't need to burden our DOE with a study of this nature.

559
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Representative Noel?

560
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
Thank you, Mr.

561
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
Chair.

562
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:57,500
I just wanted to say that we have, in Berlin, we have Brookfield Renewable, and they have a 16-plus megawatt battery installation there.

563
01:08:57,500 --> 01:09:02,000
And they are putting that on the transmission system.

564
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:13,000
And it's been in service for not quite a year yet and is one of multiple facilities that they have invested in.

565
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:47,000
They have two, one in Millinocket in Maine, and they're planning another one in lewiston they're probably in the process of uh installing it uh they find it economic to do this uh they're located on a hydro plant so they have renewable power to to charge it uh but i believe they're making their money on voltage regulation and not so much on the battery backup capacity.

566
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
That's good information.

567
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
Representative Reynolds.

568
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
Thank you, Mr.

569
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
Chairman.

570
01:09:55,000 --> 01:10:07,000
Yeah, I think I just want to support my colleagues' comments in supporting further that this legislation and type of study should go forward.

571
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:22,000
I think it's incumbent on all of us individually and incumbent on us collectively as a committee to understand as best we can the emerging trends in the energy market.

572
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:27,000
And clearly, long-term or utility-scale storage is one of them.

573
01:10:27,000 --> 01:11:01,500
I don't think the study, you know, the emphasis of the study ought not be, you know, it's not for us to get into the nitty-gritty of the technology, how it works, or what's viable and what's not, or necessarily the finances, but rather what are the, we have to understand those things such that we understand what policy instruments might, are available, could be used to facilitate this.

574
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:05,500
And I just have to point out, Mr.

575
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:17,500
Chairman, your comments about one of the problems that you see with batteries, that they're expensive, but they sit idle much of the time.

576
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:31,500
It strikes me that that characterization could be applied to peaking power plants, which we certainly have had around in New Hampshire and which are supported by rates.

577
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:38,000
So, you know, batteries are the next thing to replace peaking power plants.

578
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:41,500
So how do we facilitate the transition?

579
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:46,500
So I think we should go forward with the study.

580
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:48,500
Further comments?

581
01:11:48,500 --> 01:11:50,500
Representative Munns.

582
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:52,500
Thank you, Mr.

583
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:54,500
Chairman.

584
01:11:54,500 --> 01:12:02,500
I find myself in the very uncomfortable position of agreeing with Representative Corman and Representative Harrington.

585
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:07,000
I do believe that, you know, we can hope.

586
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:19,000
I do agree that we need to encourage the adoption of batteries more in the state for all the reasons that Representative Corman proposed.

587
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:41,500
but I also agree that I'm not sure that an additional study is going to do anything because quite frankly, we had a very similar study requirement on the books in 2022 that was supposed to have been completed by 2024, and it was not.

588
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:50,000
And that's, I think, why this bill was introduced was to try to get that going again.

589
01:12:50,000 --> 01:13:03,000
So I, I asked, I would ask the question, what, what makes us think that this is going to be any different than in the past?

590
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:08,500
And the other thing, to the point that you made, Mr.

591
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:17,500
Chair, about just the drafting or wording of the bill, There are some other issues with the drafting.

592
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:28,500
In lines 19 and lines 21, it makes reference to a, quote, a program, but it doesn't define what that program is.

593
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:34,000
In the previous legislation, it referred to what that program was.

594
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:41,500
So we would need to change the wording of this bill to be more accurate.

595
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:49,500
So bottom line, I guess I'm not sure what an additional study is going to do.

596
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:51,500
Representative McGee.

597
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:53,500
Thank you, Mr.

598
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:55,500
Chairman.

599
01:13:55,500 --> 01:14:00,500
I printed out the Senate report on the consent calendar.

600
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:05,000
They voted 5-0 in favor of passing the bill.

601
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:23,000
And they basically state that the bill incorporates an added storage requirement proposing to leverage energy storage during peak usage, an approach that seeks to reduce reliance on the transmission lines to mitigate those associated costs.

602
01:14:23,000 --> 01:15:20,000
And I think we tend to speak about costs from our own viewpoint, but the reality is that once the risk and the investment of putting in batteries around the state or in different areas, once they come online, they end up being used not only to increase reliability for the distribution grid in getting power from where it needs to go to where it's being used, but it also does mitigate that transmission expense, which New Hampshire currently picks up an inordinate amount of that expense because we haven't invested as much as our fellow states in the region and on the regional grid in terms of our dependence on the transmission line.

603
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:35,000
So I think it does warrant study because as a state, we kind of are responsible for whether or not the distribution grid within our borders is actually functioning properly.

604
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:53,500
And there are a lot of issues concerning the phasing of electrons on and off the system that we are not addressing and that are not in our plans, that we're not asking DOE to look at.

605
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:58,000
And battery storage is just one component of that.

606
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:03,000
But I don't think we get a pass on it.

607
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:25,000
I think it's something that even if we're not going to institute something for a year or two years or three years, I don't think we can avoid trying to learn to understand what it means for the state and the state's distribution system.

608
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:29,000
This bill doesn't mention distribution or transmission anywhere.

609
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
Representative Thomas.

610
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Thank you, Mr.

611
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Chair.

612
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:47,000
I was just going to say that I happen to agree with Representative Munns, who agrees with Representative Harrington, as well as Representative Quirman.

613
01:16:47,000 --> 01:17:00,500
I think now is not the time to be spending a quarter million dollars on a study that on things that are already happening in the state.

614
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:09,500
And I don't know if the Department of Energy would add anything else to to this particular study.

615
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:18,000
So at this time, I would be opposed to going forward with any legislation on this matter.

616
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:22,500
So are you making a motion to that effect?

617
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:24,500
So moved.

618
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:26,500
I make a motion.

619
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:28,500
Second.

620
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:30,500
Second.

621
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:33,000
So it's moved and seconded.

622
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,500
Let's take a straw vote.

623
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:38,500
And remember, this is not binding.

624
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:45,500
You can change your mind at executive session, but let's take a straw vote.

625
01:17:45,500 --> 01:17:53,000
All those in favor of the motion to not recommend this bill for future legislation?

626
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
Okay, nine.

627
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:59,000
All those who would vote the other way?

628
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
Five.

629
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
Nine to five.

630
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:09,500
And remember, as I said, it's non-binding, so you can change your mind.

631
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:13,500
Okay, so that's the fifth and final bill.

632
01:18:13,500 --> 01:18:20,500
Does anyone have anything that they would like to add to this work session?

633
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:22,500
Any comments?

634
01:18:22,500 --> 01:18:24,500
Representative Harrington.

635
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:35,500
Yeah, I actually had two things, but I'll save the other one for executive session because it's a little bit more germane.

636
01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:44,500
I just wanted to let people know if they're not aware of what's going on with nuclear power.

637
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:50,000
There's been a couple of really potentially very, very large events.

638
01:18:50,000 --> 01:19:01,500
One is Microsoft has signed up with a nuclear plant for $109 a megawatt to buy 100% of their output for 20 years.

639
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:03,500
Three Mile Island.

640
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:09,000
But the problem, of course, is to restart Three Mile Island.

641
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:20,000
And also, Holtec has been awarded all total, the money and loans is $3.1 billion to restart the plant out in Michigan.

642
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:28,500
They had bought the plant to decommission it, and now they've decided to put it back online.

643
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:42,500
They got a loan for $1.2 billion, and then the rural electorate co-ops that the plant would service got a grant for another one point something billion dollars.

644
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:45,500
So altogether, it's over three billion.

645
01:19:45,500 --> 01:19:49,500
And again, they're looking to restart those plants.

646
01:19:49,500 --> 01:19:58,000
So depending on how that process works, that may not be the last of these we see.

647
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:18,500
But, you know, just sort of don't hold your breath because you've got those two major issues, the interconnection, but and also the NRC, which is not known for super efficiency, especially when they have to write new first time rules.

648
01:20:18,500 --> 01:20:25,000
So but it is a step towards bringing more nuclear power back online.

649
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:40,500
And the fact they're willing to pay $109 a megawatt hour, I guess, is that they're really interested in reliability over cost because that's quite a bit higher than most contracts.

650
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:42,500
Representative Munns.

651
01:20:42,500 --> 01:21:10,000
I'm glad Representative Harrington brought that up because I think what it does is it highlights one of the impacts of artificial intelligence because that's why Microsoft is buying the power, is to drive their artificial intelligence that, um, um, because that's why Microsoft is buying the power is to drive their artificial intelligence business.

652
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:34,000
Um, and, um, I'm, I'm hoping that, um, you know, as we move forward next year, that, um, we can spend, um, some more time talking about artificial intelligence and what it means on not only the power markets, but just generally, because it's having a major impact.

653
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:40,000
Yeah, but I think we could probably bring some other people in.

654
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:49,500
I think that really needs to be a focus for those of us that are going to be returning.

655
01:21:49,500 --> 01:22:00,500
I think that really needs to be a major focus of what we look at going forward, because it has big impacts.

656
01:22:00,500 --> 01:22:02,500
Other comments?

657
01:22:02,500 --> 01:22:04,500
Representative McGee?

658
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:13,500
I just wanted to let Representative Harrington and anyone else know that doesn't know this, but the U.S.

659
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:39,500
legislature, Congress, hasn't passed very much this year, but one thing they did pass on a bipartisan basis was the Advance Act, which was basically about nuclear power and trying to remove the red tape and the expense that that red tape entails for people trying to invest in next generation plants.

660
01:22:39,500 --> 01:23:05,500
So I haven't read all of the details of the Advance Act, but it is focused expressly at making sure that if that is one of the choices that is not contributing to warming, that people are able to do it without the incredible red tape that we've put in the way.

661
01:23:05,500 --> 01:23:08,000
Yeah, I'm familiar with it.

662
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:22,500
There was a big article in Nuclear News about it, but I've just, I've been one of these guys with the NRC, having had years of experience with them.

663
01:23:22,500 --> 01:23:26,000
I'll believe it when I see it.

664
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
Any additional comments?

665
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
All right.

666
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
Oh, Representative Summers.

667
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:39,000
Sorry, since we're on this committee and we're being kind of techie right now.

668
01:23:39,000 --> 01:24:20,000
I just wanted to push out there that one thing will be coming up in the next term over the next two years is dealing with the security of qubits and qubits are, if you don't know it right now, all security, even our federal government uses what's called RSA, RSA tokens, which right now with a normal processor, it would take you tens to hundreds of years to be able to resolve a password or break a password to get in.

669
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:27,000
By using quantum computing with qubits, you now can do it in several hours.

670
01:24:27,000 --> 01:25:00,500
So there's going to be a huge push over the next year to two years to try to find some remedy with quantum computing, which is going to require more electricity, as Representative Harrington said, to be able to come up with some way to stop folks being able to use quantum computing to be able to break into all of our security that we have worldwide.

671
01:25:00,500 --> 01:25:03,500
Yes, cybersecurity is a huge problem.

672
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:12,000
George Will wrote a column in the Sunday Union Leader about cybersecurity issues just this past Sunday.

673
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
Any further comments?

674
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:32,500
All right, let's go get lunch and be back here at 1 o'clock to take up these executive session bills, interim study bills, and be thinking about which bills you would like to write the report for.

675
01:25:32,500 --> 01:25:37,500
Republicans will stay in this room for a quick caucus.

676
01:25:37,500 --> 01:25:39,500
Thank you.

677
01:25:39,500 --> 01:25:41,500
Thank you.

678
01:25:41,500 --> 01:25:43,500
Thank you.

679
01:25:43,500 --> 01:25:45,500
Thank you.

680
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:47,500
Thank you.

681
01:25:47,500 --> 01:25:49,500
Thank you.

682
01:25:49,500 --> 01:25:51,500
Thank you.

683
01:25:51,500 --> 01:25:53,500
Thank you.

684
01:25:53,500 --> 01:25:55,500
Thank you.

685
01:25:55,500 --> 01:25:57,500
Thank you.

686
01:25:57,500 --> 01:25:59,500
Thank you.

687
01:25:59,500 --> 01:26:01,500
Thank you.

688
01:26:01,500 --> 01:26:03,500
Thank you.

689
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:05,500
Thank you.

690
01:26:05,500 --> 01:26:07,500
Thank you.

691
01:26:07,500 --> 01:26:09,500
Thank you.

692
01:26:09,500 --> 01:26:11,500
Thank you.

693
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:13,500
Thank you.

694
01:26:13,500 --> 01:26:15,500
Thank you.

695
01:26:15,500 --> 01:26:17,500
Thank you.

696
01:26:17,500 --> 01:26:19,500
Thank you.

697
01:26:19,500 --> 01:26:21,500
Thank you.

698
01:26:21,500 --> 01:26:23,500
Thank you.

699
01:26:23,500 --> 01:26:25,500
Thank you.

700
01:26:25,500 --> 01:26:27,500
Thank you.

701
01:26:27,500 --> 01:26:29,500
Thank you.

702
01:26:29,500 --> 01:26:31,500
Thank you.

703
01:26:31,500 --> 01:26:33,500
Thank you.

704
01:26:33,500 --> 01:26:35,500
Thank you.

705
01:26:35,500 --> 01:26:37,500
Thank you.

706
01:26:37,500 --> 01:26:39,500
Thank you.

707
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:41,500
Thank you.

708
01:26:41,500 --> 01:26:43,500
Thank you.

709
01:26:43,500 --> 01:26:45,500
Thank you.

710
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:47,500
Thank you.

711
01:26:47,500 --> 01:26:49,500
Thank you.

712
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:51,500
Thank you.

713
01:26:51,500 --> 01:26:53,500
Thank you.

714
01:26:53,500 --> 01:26:55,500
Thank you.

715
01:26:55,500 --> 01:26:57,500
Thank you.

716
01:26:57,500 --> 01:26:59,500
Thank you.

717
01:26:59,500 --> 01:27:01,500
Thank you.

718
01:27:01,500 --> 01:27:03,500
Thank you.

719
01:27:03,500 --> 01:27:05,500
Thank you.

720
01:27:05,500 --> 01:27:07,500
Thank you.

721
01:27:07,500 --> 01:27:09,500
Thank you.

722
01:27:09,500 --> 01:27:11,500
Thank you.

723
01:27:11,500 --> 01:27:13,500
Thank you.

724
01:27:13,500 --> 01:27:15,500
Thank you.

725
01:27:15,500 --> 01:27:18,000
Okay, everybody, let's get started.

726
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:24,000
I'd like to open an executive session on our five retained bills.

727
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:30,000
We will take them in the order they appear in the calendar.

728
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:35,500
We had a work session on all five bills earlier today.

729
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:54,000
We took straw votes to indicate what we might want to do, and that will probably predict the outcome of our deliberations on these five bills, but nothing's a guarantee because those straw votes were not binding.

730
01:27:54,000 --> 01:28:08,500
So we'll start by opening an exact session on HB 509 relative to phasing out the minimum electric renewable portfolio standard, and I'll recognize Representative Harrington for a motion.

731
01:28:08,500 --> 01:28:16,500
Yeah, I move for additional legislation study on HB 509 and the subject included in it.

732
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:18,500
Representative Thomas.

733
01:28:18,500 --> 01:28:20,500
Second.

734
01:28:20,500 --> 01:28:26,000
Moved and seconded that we recommend HB 509 for additional legislation.

735
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
Any discussion?

736
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
Representative Harrington.

737
01:28:30,000 --> 01:29:13,500
Well, I might get pretty quick because I said everything I needed to say this morning but basically this phases it out over five years the renewable portfolio standard I think everybody in New Hampshire is well educated on climate change and global warming we've been constantly told about it for going on 15 years if not longer now and it's I think time to say the people of New Hampshire are smart enough to make a decision for themselves on what type of electricity to buy.

738
01:29:13,500 --> 01:29:27,000
This bill would also reinstate the rule that was suspended that says the utilities have to provide renewable energy up to 100% if requested by a customer.

739
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:33,000
The customer would have to pay any additional costs associated with that.

740
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:49,000
So the options there, either through the utility or through a competitive supplier, anybody that wants to can go out and get all types of any type of power they're looking for.

741
01:29:49,000 --> 01:30:04,000
And there's no need for the state to come in and say, you're not smart enough to make this decision for yourself, so we're going to make it for you.

742
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:18,500
Like I said, we don't tell people they have to buy a certain percentage of their produce being organic, or a certain percentage of their milk be skim milk.

743
01:30:18,500 --> 01:30:24,500
I think people are smart enough to make this decision for themselves.

744
01:30:24,500 --> 01:30:26,500
Representative McGee.

745
01:30:26,500 --> 01:30:28,500
Thank you, Mr.

746
01:30:28,500 --> 01:30:30,500
Chair.

747
01:30:30,500 --> 01:30:50,000
When we discussed this in the work session, we did, you know, none of the votes matter, but it was a 10-4 for do not recommend for further legislation, just so I can remind everybody what the discussion was.

748
01:30:50,000 --> 01:31:01,000
No one's talking about whether or not people are smart enough to make their own decisions, as was discussed in that session.

749
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:24,500
We have people and businesses that are already, you know, reliant on the RPS credits, on the REC system, and we should not be disrupting that system if we don't even know what kind of effect it's going to have on the infrastructure that we have here.

750
01:31:24,500 --> 01:31:43,500
And that was what the conversation was in the work session, is that we don't have a sense of what phasing out the RPS at this point would actually entail in terms of financial impacts to those businesses.

751
01:31:43,500 --> 01:31:52,000
We have a lot of infrastructure that has been converted in towns and municipalities to pellet burners.

752
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:57,000
There are people who've invested in infrastructure, yeah, in solar.

753
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:31,500
We also have hydro plants plants we also have biomass infrastructure and we don't have any assessment of what kind of impact there would be if we started phasing down support for this program so i i just i don't think it makes sense for us to recommend that this bill anyway or the language in this bill about phasing out the RPS is something that should move forward.

754
01:32:31,500 --> 01:32:39,500
I think that's why we sent it to IS in the first place, if I recall.

755
01:32:39,500 --> 01:32:43,500
Okay, can we move now to a vote?

756
01:32:43,500 --> 01:32:48,500
We've had a statement on both sides of this issue.

757
01:32:48,500 --> 01:32:59,000
So I'd ask the clerk to call the roll on the question of recommend for future legislation on house bill 509.

758
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
Vice chair, Thomas.

759
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
Yes.

760
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
Representative Nauter.

761
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
Yes.

762
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
Representative Harrington.

763
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
Yes.

764
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
Representative Brezhne.

765
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
Yes.

766
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
Representative Bernardi, yes.

767
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
Representative Plosje.

768
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
No.

769
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
Representative Summers.

770
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
Yes.

771
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
Representative McGee.

772
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
No.

773
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
Representative Williams.

774
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
No.

775
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
Representative Horgan.

776
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
No.

777
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
Representative Kaplan.

778
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:54,500
No.ns No Representative Noel No Representative Gallagher No Representative Corman No Representative Reynolds No Chairman Vose Yes One, two, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 7 to 10.

779
01:33:54,500 --> 01:33:56,500
Okay.

780
01:33:56,500 --> 01:34:01,500
By a vote of 7 to 10, the motion fails.

781
01:34:01,500 --> 01:34:18,000
So the only other possible motion would have to be judged the motion that we will go forward with, which is not recommended for future legislation by a vote of 10 to 7.

782
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:24,500
Does the committee feel comfortable with making that assumption without taking a vote?

783
01:34:24,500 --> 01:34:26,500
That's fine with me.

784
01:34:26,500 --> 01:34:28,500
Okay.

785
01:34:28,500 --> 01:34:36,500
So HB 509 is not recommended for future legislation by a vote of 10 to 7.

786
01:34:36,500 --> 01:34:41,000
I need a volunteer to write the calendar report.

787
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:44,500
Representative McWilliams will write the calendar report.

788
01:34:44,500 --> 01:34:46,500
When is it due?

789
01:34:46,500 --> 01:34:48,500
How about Thursday?

790
01:34:48,500 --> 01:34:50,500
Sounds good.

791
01:34:50,500 --> 01:34:52,500
Okay.

792
01:34:52,500 --> 01:34:54,500
Thank you.

793
01:34:54,500 --> 01:34:56,500
All right.

794
01:34:56,500 --> 01:35:11,500
So let's close that exec session and now open an exec session on House Bill 1398 relative to utility costs, utility recovery rather of costs associated with net energy metering.

795
01:35:11,500 --> 01:35:18,500
I will make a motion to recommend for future legislation and recognize Representative Thomas.

796
01:35:18,500 --> 01:35:20,500
Second.

797
01:35:20,500 --> 01:35:22,500
Moved and seconded.

798
01:35:22,500 --> 01:35:56,500
I'll make the quick point that recovering utility costs, I mean, net energy metering costs through stranded cost recovery is a mechanism that's been approved by the Public Utilities Commission and is currently used by the largest utility in the state, Eversource, and could be useful if the other utilities in the state used it as well for the purposes of tracking and transparency of net renewing costs.

799
01:35:56,500 --> 01:35:58,500
Further discussion, Representative McGee.

800
01:35:58,500 --> 01:36:00,500
Yes, thank you, Mr.

801
01:36:00,500 --> 01:36:02,500
Chair.

802
01:36:02,500 --> 01:36:19,500
The point I'll bring up is one that came up in our work session about how allowing utilities to recover this money across customers, all customers, kind of democratizes their costs for default service.

803
01:36:19,500 --> 01:36:26,000
But it doesn't allow the same for anyone else that's in that business.

804
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:29,000
So it does create a disadvantage.

805
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:47,500
And I think since net metering in general is being looked at in a rate case over at the Public Utilities Commission now, this is not something we should be inserting as a change into the system.

806
01:36:47,500 --> 01:36:59,500
Again, it's based on the economics, which I don't think we have a full understanding of, and I don't think we had testimony on.

807
01:36:59,500 --> 01:37:02,000
So I think it's premature.

808
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:08,500
Okay, we have a statement, pro and con, can we take a vote?

809
01:37:08,500 --> 01:37:18,500
I'll ask the clerk to call the roll on the question of recommend for future legislation on House Bill 1398.

810
01:37:18,500 --> 01:37:20,500
Vice Chair Thomas.

811
01:37:20,500 --> 01:37:22,500
Yes.

812
01:37:22,500 --> 01:37:24,500
Representative Nauter.

813
01:37:24,500 --> 01:37:26,500
Yes.

814
01:37:26,500 --> 01:37:28,500
Representative Harrington.

815
01:37:28,500 --> 01:37:30,500
No.

816
01:37:30,500 --> 01:37:32,500
Representative Brezhne.

817
01:37:32,500 --> 01:37:34,500
Yes.

818
01:37:34,500 --> 01:37:36,500
Representative Nodder.

819
01:37:36,500 --> 01:37:38,500
Yes.

820
01:37:38,500 --> 01:37:40,500
Representative Harrington.

821
01:37:40,500 --> 01:37:42,500
No.

822
01:37:42,500 --> 01:37:44,500
Representative Brezhne.

823
01:37:44,500 --> 01:37:46,500
Yes.

824
01:37:46,500 --> 01:37:48,500
Representative Bernardi.

825
01:37:48,500 --> 01:37:50,500
Yes.

826
01:37:50,500 --> 01:37:52,500
Representative Plosier.

827
01:37:52,500 --> 01:37:54,500
Yes.

828
01:37:54,500 --> 01:37:56,500
Representative Summers.

829
01:37:56,500 --> 01:37:58,500
Yes.

830
01:37:58,500 --> 01:38:00,500
Representative McGee.

831
01:38:00,500 --> 01:38:02,500
No.

832
01:38:02,500 --> 01:38:04,500
Representative McWilliams.

833
01:38:04,500 --> 01:38:06,500
No.

834
01:38:06,500 --> 01:38:08,500
Representative Horgan.

835
01:38:08,500 --> 01:38:10,500
No.

836
01:38:10,500 --> 01:38:12,500
Thank you.

837
01:38:12,500 --> 01:38:27,000
mcgee no representative mcwilliams no uh representative horgan no representative kaplan no representative munns no representative noel no representative gallagher no representative Corman no representative Reynolds no chairman Gallagher?

838
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,000
No.

839
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
Representative Corman?

840
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
No.

841
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
Representative Reynolds?

842
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
No.

843
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
Chairman Vose?

844
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
Yes.

845
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
Same 7 to 10.

846
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
Okay.

847
01:38:45,000 --> 01:39:03,000
The vote on the motion to recommend for future legislation fails with a of 7 to 10, which makes the default a recommendation of not recommended for future legislation by a vote of 10 to 7.

848
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:09,000
And I will volunteer to write the calendar report for HB 1398.

849
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:27,000
So we'll close that executive session and now open the executive session on HB 1508, requiring fiber optic communication service providers to prioritize service restoration for public safety and public health organizations and recognize Representative Thomas.

850
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
Thank you, Mr.

851
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,000
Chair.

852
01:39:31,000 --> 01:40:57,500
on hb 1508 i my motion is to recommend for further legislation recognize representative bernardi second that motion moved and seconded that we recommend hb 508 for additional legislation representative thomas yes thank you mr chair Realizing that we're dealing with a private company here, we have a situation where a first responder was unable to get satisfaction to restore his communication system anywhere near in a reasonable time despite repeated efforts contacting the company in question he received no satisfaction whatsoever and with the point that bothers me the most is that when he went to get other help from the state the state said sorry we're just not authorized to deal with anything like that because you're dealing with a private company I believe this bill properly written because as it's written now, it's just too vague, properly written could emphasize the importance of any company dealing with communications involving first responders to either be more responsive or in some way facilitate them to put the system back into order again.

853
01:40:57,500 --> 01:41:28,000
I believe future legislation, which we don't want to require anything in one sense, but maybe in a sense wording something that makes it very clear to companies that if they're dealing with first responders that they must prioritize in some way getting the first responders' communications back up to speed, I think has some merit and probably bears further investigation.

854
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
Representative Harrington.

855
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:40,000
Yeah, as I said this morning, I think the major problem with this is I don't think we have jurisdiction.

856
01:41:40,000 --> 01:42:00,000
From my days at the PUC, the FCC made it pretty clear that, for example, with phones, once you went from, say, Verizon to a cable company providing voice over IP, that the state PUCs no longer had any jurisdiction.

857
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:11,500
I don't think we have any jurisdiction over fiber optic or cable providers, even though I think the bill just says fiber optic.

858
01:42:11,500 --> 01:42:17,000
I'm assuming it would be extended to internet providers in general.

859
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:25,500
So if we have no jurisdiction, we really can't pass a law telling them what to do.

860
01:42:25,500 --> 01:42:36,000
So I think this is at least until we determine from a legal point of view that we have some authority.

861
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:40,500
I can't see Pat trying to pass a bill.

862
01:42:40,500 --> 01:42:42,500
Any further discussion?

863
01:42:42,500 --> 01:42:44,500
Yes, Representative Corman.

864
01:42:44,500 --> 01:42:46,500
Thank you.

865
01:42:46,500 --> 01:42:50,000
Yeah, I won't be voting for this.

866
01:42:50,000 --> 01:43:01,500
I really feel like this is the responsibility of the first responder to have a backup system, and it shouldn't be that hard.

867
01:43:01,500 --> 01:43:04,000
We're talking low bandwidth communication.

868
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:15,000
We're not talking anything really fancy here, and I really feel like this is on the first responder of this particular incident.

869
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,000
Any further discussion?

870
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:28,000
Seeing none, I'll ask the clerk to call the roll on the question of recommend for future legislation on House Bill 1508.

871
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
Thank you.

872
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:41,000
Seeing none, I'll ask the clerk to call the roll on the question of recommend for future legislation on House Bill 1508.

873
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,000
Lysher Thomas.

874
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
Yes.

875
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
Representative Nodder.

876
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
Yes.

877
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
Representative Harrington.

878
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,000
No.

879
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,000
Representative Brezhne.

880
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,000
No.

881
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
Representative Bernardi.

882
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,000
Yes.

883
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000
Representative Plosje.

884
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
No.

885
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
Representative Bernardi, yes.

886
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
Representative Ploget.

887
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
No.

888
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
Representative Summers.

889
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
No.

890
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,000
Representative McGee.

891
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
Yes.

892
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
Representative McWilliams.

893
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,000
Yes.

894
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,000
Representative Horgan.

895
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
Yes.

896
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000
Representative Kaplan.

897
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,000
No.

898
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,000
Representative Munns.

899
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,000
No.

900
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,000
Representative Noel.

901
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:52,500
yes representative kaplan no representative munns no representative noelle yes representative gallagher yes representative corman no representative reynolds no chairman vose no One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

902
01:44:52,500 --> 01:45:03,000
By a vote of eight to nine, the motion to recommend fails, making the default recommendation not recommended for future legislation.

903
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:10,500
And I need someone to write a calendar report for this particular piece of legislation.

904
01:45:10,500 --> 01:45:12,500
Okay, Representative Harrington.

905
01:45:12,500 --> 01:45:16,000
Representative Hington will write the calendar report.

906
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:19,000
I need it by Thursday, Mike.

907
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:24,000
And that concludes the exec session on House Bill 1508.

908
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:35,000
So next up would be to open an exec session on House Bill 1617FN relative to energy procurement agreements for default service.

909
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:38,000
And the chair recognizes Representative Bernardi.

910
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
Thank you, Mr.

911
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
Chair.

912
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:45,500
I recommend not recommended for future legislation.

913
01:45:45,500 --> 01:45:47,500
Representative Thomas.

914
01:45:47,500 --> 01:45:49,500
Second.

915
01:45:49,500 --> 01:45:55,000
Moved and seconded that we not recommend this for future legislation.

916
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
Representative Bernardi.

917
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
Thank you, Mr.

918
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000
Chair.

919
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:17,000
As was discussed in our earlier session, work session, this issue is already being addressed by PUC and DOE, and therefore, we don't need to stick our oar further in the water.

920
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
Further discussion?

921
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:29,500
Seeing none, I'll ask Clerk to call the roll on the question of not recommend for future legislation, House Bill 1617.

922
01:46:29,500 --> 01:46:31,500
Vice Chair Thomas.

923
01:46:31,500 --> 01:46:33,500
Yes.

924
01:46:33,500 --> 01:46:35,500
Representative Nodder.

925
01:46:35,500 --> 01:46:37,500
Yes.

926
01:46:37,500 --> 01:46:39,500
Representative Harrington.

927
01:46:39,500 --> 01:46:41,500
Yes.

928
01:46:41,500 --> 01:46:43,500
Representative Brezhne.

929
01:46:43,500 --> 01:46:45,500
Yes.

930
01:46:45,500 --> 01:46:47,500
Representative Bernardi.

931
01:46:47,500 --> 01:46:49,500
Yes.

932
01:46:49,500 --> 01:46:51,500
Representative Ploge.

933
01:46:51,500 --> 01:46:53,500
Yes.

934
01:46:53,500 --> 01:46:55,500
Representative Summers.

935
01:46:55,500 --> 01:46:57,500
Yes.

936
01:46:57,500 --> 01:46:59,500
Representative McGee.

937
01:46:59,500 --> 01:47:01,500
Yes.

938
01:47:01,500 --> 01:47:03,500
Representative McWilliams.

939
01:47:03,500 --> 01:47:05,500
Yes.

940
01:47:05,500 --> 01:47:07,500
Representative Horgan.

941
01:47:07,500 --> 01:47:09,500
Yes.

942
01:47:09,500 --> 01:47:11,500
Representative Kaplan.

943
01:47:11,500 --> 01:47:13,500
Yes.

944
01:47:13,500 --> 01:47:15,500
Representative Munns.

945
01:47:15,500 --> 01:47:17,500
Yes.

946
01:47:17,500 --> 01:47:19,500
Representative Noel.

947
01:47:19,500 --> 01:47:21,500
Yes.

948
01:47:21,500 --> 01:47:23,500
Representative Kaplan.

949
01:47:23,500 --> 01:47:25,500
Yes.

950
01:47:25,500 --> 01:47:27,500
Representative Munns.

951
01:47:27,500 --> 01:47:29,500
Yes.

952
01:47:29,500 --> 01:47:31,500
Representative Noel.

953
01:47:31,500 --> 01:47:33,500
Yes.

954
01:47:33,500 --> 01:47:35,500
Representative Gallagher.

955
01:47:35,500 --> 01:47:37,500
Yes.

956
01:47:37,500 --> 01:47:39,500
Representative Corman.

957
01:47:39,500 --> 01:47:41,500
Yes.

958
01:47:41,500 --> 01:47:43,500
Representative Reynolds.

959
01:47:43,500 --> 01:47:45,500
Yes.

960
01:47:45,500 --> 01:47:47,500
Chairman Bowes.

961
01:47:47,500 --> 01:47:49,500
Yes.

962
01:47:49,500 --> 01:47:51,500
17 to 0.

963
01:47:51,500 --> 01:47:53,500
17 to 0.

964
01:47:53,500 --> 01:47:58,500
We vote to not recommend this bill for future legislation.

965
01:47:58,500 --> 01:48:04,000
And Representative Bernardi, you will write the House calendar report, correct?

966
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
Yes.

967
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
Thank you.

968
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:15,000
Close the executive session on House Bill 1617 and move to our last bill.

969
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:21,000
Open an exec session on Senate Bill 540 and recognize Representative Thomas.

970
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,000
Thank you, Mr.

971
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,000
Chair.

972
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:30,500
I make motion to not recommend it for further legislative action.

973
01:48:30,500 --> 01:48:32,500
Representative Bernardi.

974
01:48:32,500 --> 01:48:34,500
Second that motion.

975
01:48:34,500 --> 01:49:27,000
Moved and seconded that we judge Senate Bill 540 to be not worthy of recommendation for future legislation representative thomas thank you mr chair uh during uh work session it was clearly displayed that there are several uh institutions you know using batteries right now information that might be gleaned from a from a study, especially from the Department of Energy here in New Hampshire, and spending over a quarter million dollars to do such a study on things that are already being done seems to be of no significant benefit at this time, which is why I chose not to recommend for further action.

976
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,000
Representative Corman.

977
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:32,500
Representative Reynolds, you have your bank on.

978
01:49:32,500 --> 01:49:34,500
Thank you, Mr.

979
01:49:34,500 --> 01:49:36,500
Chairman.

980
01:49:36,500 --> 01:49:56,500
Just to repeat some of the points I made earlier, we are finding that batteries are going to be significant game changers in the markets and in how energy is distributed and at what time and the impacts on transmission.

981
01:49:56,500 --> 01:50:05,500
This particular bill also does call for study of behind the meter, so it's not entirely utility scale.

982
01:50:05,500 --> 01:50:13,500
And I think we're going to start seeing some impacts of behind the meter as well.

983
01:50:13,500 --> 01:50:19,500
I myself have batteries and that has actually changed my energy profile.

984
01:50:19,500 --> 01:50:23,500
So I do think this is worth study.

985
01:50:23,500 --> 01:50:34,000
I understand Representative Thomas's point about spending money on it, but in the scheme of things, it's not that much money.

986
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:39,000
We're spending that much to extend the 603 area code.

987
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:49,000
This seems like something that we should be getting ahead of and understanding because it is going to affect markets.

988
01:50:49,000 --> 01:51:01,000
And with all due respect to Representative Harrington's points about that, when government puts the thumb on the markets, the markets get screwed up.

989
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:05,000
That doesn't mean that we shouldn't understand them.

990
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:08,500
And I think we should understand them.

991
01:51:08,500 --> 01:51:12,000
Live free or die in the 603.

992
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
Any further discussion?

993
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:23,500
Seeing none, I'll ask the clerk to call the question of not recommending Senate Bill 540 for future legislation.

994
01:51:23,500 --> 01:51:25,500
Vice Chair Thomas.

995
01:51:25,500 --> 01:51:27,500
Yes.

996
01:51:27,500 --> 01:51:29,500
Representative Nodder.

997
01:51:29,500 --> 01:51:31,500
Yes.

998
01:51:31,500 --> 01:51:33,500
Representative Harrington.

999
01:51:33,500 --> 01:51:35,500
Yes.

1000
01:51:35,500 --> 01:51:37,500
Representative Brezhne.

1001
01:51:37,500 --> 01:51:39,500
Yes.

1002
01:51:39,500 --> 01:51:41,500
Representative Bernardi.

1003
01:51:41,500 --> 01:51:43,500
Yes.

1004
01:51:43,500 --> 01:51:45,500
Representative Plosje.

1005
01:51:45,500 --> 01:51:47,500
Yes.

1006
01:51:47,500 --> 01:51:49,500
Representative Summers.

1007
01:51:49,500 --> 01:51:51,500
Yes.

1008
01:51:51,500 --> 01:51:53,500
Representative McGee.

1009
01:51:53,500 --> 01:51:55,500
No.

1010
01:51:55,500 --> 01:51:57,500
Representative McWilliams.

1011
01:51:57,500 --> 01:51:59,500
No.

1012
01:51:59,500 --> 01:52:01,500
Representative McGee.

1013
01:52:01,500 --> 01:52:03,500
No.

1014
01:52:03,500 --> 01:52:05,500
Representative McWilliams.

1015
01:52:05,500 --> 01:52:07,500
No.

1016
01:52:07,500 --> 01:52:09,500
Representative Horrigan.

1017
01:52:09,500 --> 01:52:11,500
No.

1018
01:52:11,500 --> 01:52:13,500
Representative Kaplan.

1019
01:52:13,500 --> 01:52:15,500
No.

1020
01:52:15,500 --> 01:52:17,500
Representative Munns.

1021
01:52:17,500 --> 01:52:19,500
No.

1022
01:52:19,500 --> 01:52:21,500
Representative Noelle.

1023
01:52:21,500 --> 01:52:23,500
No.

1024
01:52:23,500 --> 01:52:25,500
Representative Gallagher.

1025
01:52:25,500 --> 01:52:27,500
No.

1026
01:52:27,500 --> 01:52:29,500
Representative Corman.

1027
01:52:29,500 --> 01:52:31,500
No.

1028
01:52:31,500 --> 01:52:33,500
Representative Reynolds.

1029
01:52:33,500 --> 01:52:35,500
No.

1030
01:52:35,500 --> 01:52:37,500
Chairman Vose?

1031
01:52:37,500 --> 01:52:39,500
Yes.

1032
01:52:39,500 --> 01:52:41,500
8 to 9.

1033
01:52:41,500 --> 01:52:49,500
By a vote of 8 to 9, the recommendation of recommend, no, the recommend is defeated.

1034
01:52:49,500 --> 01:52:53,500
So the recommendation will be recommend by default.

1035
01:52:53,500 --> 01:52:57,000
And the vote is 9 to 8.

1036
01:52:57,000 --> 01:53:02,000
And Representative Corman will write the report for the calendar.

1037
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:23,500
So with that, we'll close that executive session and complete our activity for the day by recognizing Representative Harrington, who would like to discuss an issue that we should all be aware of, will probably be a significant topic in the new session.

1038
01:53:23,500 --> 01:53:32,500
Yeah, I'm not sure if everyone caught it, but there's a project that Eversource is running right now.

1039
01:53:32,500 --> 01:53:35,500
This is a New England-wide issue.

1040
01:53:35,500 --> 01:53:37,500
It's called asset conditioning.

1041
01:53:37,500 --> 01:53:39,500
That's the term.

1042
01:53:39,500 --> 01:53:47,500
I don't know where they came up with it, but it basically means refurbishing existing transmission.

1043
01:53:47,500 --> 01:53:53,000
The cost is going to be in the billions of dollars.

1044
01:53:53,000 --> 01:54:25,000
There's a present project being done now in New Hampshire for $400 million, and it came in front of the Site Evaluation Committee, and I think the consumer advocate or someone like him tried to bring up was it really needed and why was it costing so much, and they basically said they had no standing in the committee and were asked to leave.

1045
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:34,000
They were correct because the site evaluation committee does not look at cost, does not look at need.

1046
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:55,000
The idea is if somebody wants to build a whatever 40 megawatt power plant, the question is, does it comply with all of New Hampshire's siting laws, not whether the power plant is necessary or if it's expensive or not too inexpensive.

1047
01:54:55,000 --> 01:55:07,500
The problem with the transmission is, as my friend from Rhode Island coined the phrase, transmission is the largest unregulated monopoly in the United States.

1048
01:55:07,500 --> 01:55:24,500
And I checked with Nesco on this, New England States Committee on Electricity, or the New England, whatever it is, New England States Committee on Electricity, and that represents all six of the states.

1049
01:55:24,500 --> 01:55:41,000
They've put this as their number one issue and their report to all six New England, whatever it is, New England State's Community on Electricity, and that represents all six of the states.

1050
01:55:41,000 --> 01:56:00,500
They've put this as their number one issue to the, and their report to all six New England governors for this year, saying that this was going to be billions of dollars and it's not looked at by anybody.

1051
01:56:00,500 --> 01:56:19,000
According to the people at Nesco, they even checked with FERC, who would have jurisdiction over transmission, and they were told, if you send something down to us, we don't have anyone to look at it anyways.

1052
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:23,500
So basically, there is no one looking at this.

1053
01:56:23,500 --> 01:56:32,000
And as much as I believe in free markets, this isn't a free market, it's a monopoly.

1054
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:37,000
So if it's a monopoly, it needs to be regulated.

1055
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:42,500
And we have to look at a way of doing that.

1056
01:56:42,500 --> 01:57:11,000
What I'm going to be proposing, and I'm not sure how far this will get, but the Site Evaluation Committee statute would be changed so that for a project that where the cost and need are not reviewed by another state or federal agency, the Site Evaluation Committee will take those facts into consideration granting a certificate.

1057
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:28,500
So if they can't show that this is the most efficient way to do it, then the site evaluation committee could say, well, we're not going to give you a certificate until you do that.

1058
01:57:28,500 --> 01:57:38,000
I'm sure the utilities are going to fight like hell, but I think, again, this is billions of dollars.

1059
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:46,000
And I don't know how many people have been looked at transmission projects in the past.

1060
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:54,500
They have gotten better, but historically they would run somewhere in the vicinity of 100% cost overruns.

1061
01:57:54,500 --> 01:58:00,000
That was like automatic when they put new transmission projects in.

1062
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:05,000
They'd say, well, this is going to cost $300 million.

1063
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:08,500
It would come back at $600 million.

1064
01:58:08,500 --> 01:58:12,000
This is going to cost $700 million.

1065
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:15,500
It would come back at $1.4 billion.

1066
01:58:15,500 --> 01:58:20,000
And by ISO rules applied by FERC, that's acceptable.

1067
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:27,000
Up to 200% over the cost is within their range, minus 50% plus 200%.

1068
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:33,500
I don't know how they come up with those numbers, but they did.

1069
01:58:33,500 --> 01:58:57,500
So I just think it's important that we try to look at this and say, you know, at least from New Hampshire's point of view, you're going to have to make some attempt to show that this is necessary and that you're being cost effective in doing it.

1070
01:58:57,500 --> 01:59:02,000
Because right now, no one's looking at anything, literally.

1071
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:07,500
And like I say, it's going to be billions of dollars.

1072
01:59:07,500 --> 01:59:18,500
If you look at that, find out more about it, you can check out the NESCO report to the New England governors.

1073
01:59:18,500 --> 01:59:24,000
I think it was issued in July or something like that.

1074
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:29,000
Just wanted to get people to be aware of that.

1075
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:36,000
There is a current asset condition project before the Site Evaluation Committee right now.

1076
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:45,500
It's a $400 million project, and the state of New Hampshire's share of that project will be $40 million.

1077
01:59:45,500 --> 01:59:51,500
So that'll be added to transmission costs once the project is completed.

1078
01:59:51,500 --> 02:00:01,000
Eversource wants to replace wooden transmission towers in a 60-mile stretch of the transmission corridor with metal transmission towers.

1079
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:06,500
And they want to upgrade the wire to fiber optic wire.

1080
02:00:06,500 --> 02:00:11,000
So it's going to be a very expensive project.

1081
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:19,000
If legislation submitted for the 2025 session were to pass, it would not affect this project.

1082
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:22,000
This project would go forward regardless.

1083
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:28,000
So we're going to get stuck with those costs no matter what.

1084
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:36,500
But the question is, how do we provide oversight to future projects that want to upgrade transmission?

1085
02:00:36,500 --> 02:00:39,500
So that's the important question here.

1086
02:00:39,500 --> 02:00:50,000
And one other thing just to emphasize, because this project's in New Hampshire, it really doesn't make any difference to us.

1087
02:00:50,000 --> 02:01:00,500
If it's in New England, so if they're doing it in Connecticut, we're still going to get 10% of the bill.

1088
02:01:00,500 --> 02:01:06,000
So we can't control anything that happens in the other states.

1089
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:42,000
Maybe if we can get this through, the will join in but this is not just okay it's done in new hampshire forget about it because they do it in maine they do it massachusetts we're still going to get a bill for it representative mcgee yeah just a thought um i was thinking about this recently there's a lot of changes going on trying to work on grid reliability and upgrades.

1090
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:51,500
And I know, you know, grid reliability is something that we're going to pay for one way or another.

1091
02:01:51,500 --> 02:02:10,500
But it struck me that this committee and the state in general has very little insight into those investments in terms of what we get for it and how long it will last us because technology is ever-changing.

1092
02:02:10,500 --> 02:02:27,500
And sometimes when investments are made in the state infrastructure, we're not really sure how long that gets amortized over, when it's going to need to be fixed again, or what we're getting, basically.

1093
02:02:27,500 --> 02:02:30,000
We don't have those conversations.

1094
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:51,000
So to Representative Harrington's point, we probably should have some changes in statutory language in terms of what we look at, when we look at it, because after the fact, then it's a stranded cost and everybody's going to pay for it.

1095
02:02:51,000 --> 02:03:11,000
but beforehand if we at least understand what we're getting for the money it might be more helpful because what seems to happen is as soon as one large cost gets approved, the next large cost is in the queue.

1096
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:32,000
And so, you know, I wish we had a more of a planning perspective around the grid and transmission and distribution in the state, because I think that's the only way to really get a handle on costs, but that's just me.

1097
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:40,500
Okay, I want to bring everybody up to date on one other topic you might find interesting.

1098
02:03:40,500 --> 02:03:46,500
I'm currently chairing a commission to study the assessing of power generation.

1099
02:03:46,500 --> 02:04:00,000
It's been a very difficult and contentious subject in our state, because we have the Department of Revenue Administration assessing generation plants for the utility property tax.

1100
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:08,000
And then we have municipal assessors assessing plants for the swept tax, statewide education property tax.

1101
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:12,000
And those two numbers are frequently extremely different.

1102
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:16,500
And this has led to a plethora of lawsuits.

1103
02:04:16,500 --> 02:04:29,000
And the people who pay for those lawsuits are you and I, both as ratepayers on the utility side and taxpayers on the municipal side.

1104
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:40,500
So our commission has been, this is the third iteration of this commission, and we have been studying a solution to this problem.

1105
02:04:40,500 --> 02:04:52,000
And I'm relatively certain, although we still have three or four more meetings before we generate a report, we've already had four meetings.

1106
02:04:52,000 --> 02:05:01,000
But I'm relatively certain that we're going to submit legislation to remove generation from the utility property tax.

1107
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:05,500
And that will remove the DRA from the equation.

1108
02:05:05,500 --> 02:05:13,000
So the only assessing of power plants will be done by assessors hired by municipalities.

1109
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:20,500
So removing that contention between these two different evaluations should significantly reduce lawsuits and litigation.

1110
02:05:20,500 --> 02:05:25,000
It won't completely eliminate it, but it'll reduce it.

1111
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:38,500
The points of contention that we're wrestling with right now is whether we should require the utilities to do some kind of reporting on their business income.

1112
02:05:38,500 --> 02:05:42,000
We don't require that of other manufacturers.

1113
02:05:42,000 --> 02:06:00,000
And if you consider a utility to be a manufacturer of electricity, then the question is, should we require them to report on the value of what they produce and use that in the assessing process?

1114
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:06,500
That currently happens, but the generators say that it shouldn't happen going forward.

1115
02:06:06,500 --> 02:06:20,000
The other issue we're wrestling with a little bit is equalization, because a generation plant, unlike a house, doesn't change value up and down like houses do.

1116
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:24,000
Its value is pretty steady throughout its lifetime.

1117
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:43,000
So we're trying to figure out how to use, how to modify legislation about equalization so that the power generators don't have to be subject to ebbs and flows in the value of their asset based on equalization.

1118
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:57,500
But we will have a report by November 1st, and hopefully I think we have a solution going forward so we won't have to study this issue any further.

1119
02:06:57,500 --> 02:07:01,000
So that's my report on that commission.

1120
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:09,500
We meet Tuesday mornings at nine o'clock at the Department of Revenue and Administration off Pleasant Street.

1121
02:07:09,500 --> 02:07:13,000
You're welcome to attend if you like.

1122
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:27,000
Representative Munns serves on that committee with myself and two members of Ways and Means and two members of Municipal and County, plus a bunch of industry folks.

1123
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:30,000
So that's my update on that.

1124
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:35,000
Anybody else have any updates on commissions they're serving on?

1125
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:37,000
Representative Thomas.

1126
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:44,000
Just to know that we'll be having our first meeting of the new session.

1127
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:51,500
I sit on the commission for determining alternative measures, alternative methods for road toll tax.

1128
02:07:51,500 --> 02:07:58,500
And we'll be meeting tomorrow to, we've met before, but in the previous biennium.

1129
02:07:58,500 --> 02:08:44,000
And so this is the first one one this year and we'll be meeting again to discuss you know i think i've heard just about every possible uh method so far i even attended ncsl where they had a special seminar on the same subject and the only thing i knew i i heard at that seminar was something that maine is looking at doing which is establishing some sort of a special road lane to have for EVs, and they maybe pay a special fee to drive in that lane.

1130
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:55,000
I didn't quite catch it all because I had to arrive late there, but that was the only new thing I heard.

1131
02:08:55,000 --> 02:09:00,000
But we'll discuss it tomorrow and see what it brings.

1132
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:09,500
We're still trying to get our hands around a new paradigm as we move forward with this new technology.

1133
02:09:09,500 --> 02:09:15,500
Does that commission or committee have to have a report this year?

1134
02:09:15,500 --> 02:09:24,500
We haven't had a meeting yet, so I didn't look at the details, but I'll find out tomorrow.

1135
02:09:24,500 --> 02:09:26,500
I don't know.

1136
02:09:26,500 --> 02:09:29,500
The answer is I don't know.

1137
02:09:29,500 --> 02:10:09,000
It seems like it should because it's the first one they've met, and it's near the end of the year so but i don't know well there's not much time to no produce a report what's there usually do around november 1st representative herrington yeah just one other thing i'm not officially on the on this commission but i've been following it closely because i was on it 20 years ago and the situation really hasn't gotten much better.

1138
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:12,500
This is on dams in New Hampshire.

1139
02:10:12,500 --> 02:10:52,500
There's about a hundred million dollars worth of repairs needed to dams and I think you've probably heard like I think it was earlier this summer, the spring, they were talking about tearing down a dam in the Manchester area someplace which would effectively turn was a hundred acre lake into a stream with a lot of mud and they some guy on TV, and he was saying about how he just put in a $15,000 dock and so forth.

1140
02:10:52,500 --> 02:11:03,000
Part of the problems is the hydroelectric dams, when their license gets renewed, they're required to put in a fish ladder.

1141
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:12,500
And a lot of them look at that and say, it's not worth the cost to put it in.

1142
02:11:12,500 --> 02:11:16,500
I don't make enough money to cover it.

1143
02:11:16,500 --> 02:11:22,500
So once they leave, they no longer maintain maintenance on the dam.

1144
02:11:22,500 --> 02:11:31,500
So the commission is looking at two possible funding mechanisms because the money's going to come from someplace.

1145
02:11:31,500 --> 02:11:45,500
And, you know, the obvious, maybe too obvious solution is, well, let's just charge the people who have the waterfront property because they get the advantage of them.

1146
02:11:45,500 --> 02:11:51,500
But having waterfront property makes a huge difference in their tax bill.

1147
02:11:51,500 --> 02:12:05,500
So if the dam were to go away on a lake, you know, a house that's worth a million dollars may only be worth a half a million.

1148
02:12:05,500 --> 02:12:13,000
So the first thing they're going to do is file for reduction in property taxes.

1149
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:20,500
So since generally spending doesn't go down, everyone else's taxes are going to go up.

1150
02:12:20,500 --> 02:12:28,500
So we're trying to look at some way of making it a little bit more equitable.

1151
02:12:28,500 --> 02:12:39,500
One thing it may be is a shoreline assessment fee, and the other thing looking at it is a boat registration fee.

1152
02:12:39,500 --> 02:12:53,500
So you may hear on both of those, because everybody that puts a boat in a lake in New Hampshire generally is in a lake with a dam.

1153
02:12:53,500 --> 02:12:56,000
So just a heads up.

1154
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,000
Representative McGee?

1155
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,000
Thanks, Mr.

1156
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
Chairman.

1157
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:14,000
Yeah, I was just reading that we still have about 300 million, 300 and something million in ARPA funds that haven't been totally spent.

1158
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:23,000
And that one of the five things that you could focus on in your state was water infrastructure.

1159
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:28,000
They understand that a lot of states have aging infrastructure.

1160
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:32,000
And it's not just for cities and towns.

1161
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:34,000
It's also for culverts.

1162
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:44,500
And, you know, basically, you know, as we saw with the floods that we had last December, you know, flooding infrastructure.

1163
02:13:44,500 --> 02:14:01,000
So I think, you know, that would be a logical place to take the money from if there needs to be repairs, because it's pretty hard to make individuals pick up that cost.

1164
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:07,500
It'd probably be, like you said, $100 million is a lot of money.

1165
02:14:07,500 --> 02:14:10,000
But I'd look at that.

1166
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:12,000
Representative Plosje.

1167
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,000
Thank you, Chair.

1168
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:30,500
Another committee, Representative Bresni and I are on, is, I have to look this up, Committee to Study the Feasibility and Impact of a New Hampshire Clean Energy Community Resilience and conservation corps.

1169
02:14:30,500 --> 02:14:34,000
That was, I believe, House Bill 1499.

1170
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:40,500
We have three more meetings before a report is due on November 1st.

1171
02:14:40,500 --> 02:14:42,500
Okay, good.

1172
02:14:42,500 --> 02:14:44,500
Anything else?

1173
02:14:44,500 --> 02:14:46,500
Representative Thomas.

1174
02:14:46,500 --> 02:14:48,500
Yes, Mr.

1175
02:14:48,500 --> 02:14:50,500
Chairman.

1176
02:14:50,500 --> 02:15:20,500
Well, this is the last meeting of this committee, and so I would like to thank all committee members that we know will not be coming back next time, and I'd like to thank those committee members that may or may not come back next time, and to congratulate everyone for a fine session of good discussions, good civil discussions.

1177
02:15:20,500 --> 02:15:36,500
We enjoyed it very much, and I appreciate all the work that was being done, and I wish best wishes to all of those, whether you're back here or not next year.

1178
02:15:36,500 --> 02:15:38,500
Representative McWilliams.

1179
02:15:38,500 --> 02:15:40,500
Thank you, Representative Thomas.

1180
02:15:40,500 --> 02:15:43,000
I appreciate your kind remarks.

1181
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:57,000
As a six-year member of this committee, I just wanted to look around and acknowledge everyone that I've been able to work with for the last six years.

1182
02:15:57,000 --> 02:15:59,000
It's been an honor.

1183
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:18,500
I'll miss you, and the work continues, so I appreciate everything that you have put in to do good things for our state's energy policy, and I look forward to seeing more good things from you in the future.

1184
02:16:18,500 --> 02:16:20,500
Thank you.

1185
02:16:20,500 --> 02:16:22,500
It's been an honor.

1186
02:16:22,500 --> 02:16:27,500
And we thank you for your service on this committee.

1187
02:16:27,500 --> 02:16:33,500
You've added immeasurably to our deliberations and discussions, and we appreciate it.

1188
02:16:33,500 --> 02:16:43,500
And we wish you well in the future, and we expect we'll probably see you back here at some point.

1189
02:16:43,500 --> 02:16:45,500
Anything else?

1190
02:16:45,500 --> 02:16:47,500
Representative McGee.

1191
02:16:47,500 --> 02:16:53,000
I'd just like to thank our subs again for coming in.

1192
02:16:53,000 --> 02:17:01,500
We know this is a busy time of year, so we really appreciate you taking the time.

1193
02:17:01,500 --> 02:17:06,000
Yes, thank you very much to both of you.

1194
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:16,000
And also, I'd like to commend Chairman Bowes for doing an excellent job as our chairman the last two years.

1195
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,000
That's very kind.

1196
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,000
Thank you.

1197
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,000
I appreciate that.

1198
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:24,500
So I guess we're done.

1199
02:17:24,500 --> 02:17:30,500
So everybody, good luck with your reelection campaigns, if you have one.

1200
02:17:30,500 --> 02:17:34,500
And we'll see you when we see you.

1201
02:17:34,500 --> 02:17:39,500
We'll see you on Veto Day this Thursday, I suspect.

1202
02:17:39,500 --> 02:17:42,000
So have a pleasant evening.

1203
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,000
Thank you.
