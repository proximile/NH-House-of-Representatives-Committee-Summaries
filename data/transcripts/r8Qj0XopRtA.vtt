00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 align:start position:0%
in ena
 
00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 align:start position:0%
i want to welcome everybody back and
 
00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 align:start position:0%
hopefully you all survived the weekend
 
00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 align:start position:0%
so we have a few bills on our agenda
 
00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 align:start position:0%
today that we're going to work on and i
 
00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:09.039 align:start position:0%
intend to do
 
00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 align:start position:0%
an exec session
 
00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
not prior to 11 p.m we'll start whenever
 
00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
we're done the work session but not
 
00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
prior to 11 pm because i made that
 
00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 align:start position:0%
commitment to a few folks who
 
00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 align:start position:0%
were out so if we do get done our work
 
00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 align:start position:0%
session a little bit earlier we'll just
 
00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
take a break until after 11 but we will
 
00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:27.600 align:start position:0%
be exacting anytime after 11 pm 11am
 
00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:35.120 align:start position:0%
so we have
 
00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:37.280 align:start position:0%
five bills on our scheduled work session
 
00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960 align:start position:0%
today i guess we'll take them in the
 
00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:40.720 align:start position:0%
order that they were listed which
 
00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:42.479 align:start position:0%
appears to be numerical since nobody
 
00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.240 align:start position:0%
seemed to have a preference on
 
00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:45.600 align:start position:0%
how we uh
 
00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:47.840 align:start position:0%
how we did it
 
00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:49.840 align:start position:0%
so the first one we'll look at is uh
 
00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:50.840 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:53.360 align:start position:0%
1168 this is established as a study
 
00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.670 align:start position:0%
1168 this is established as a study
committee

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:57.680 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire law relative to soil
 
00:05:59.830 --> 00:05:59.840 align:start position:0%
conditioners and that is representative
 
00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:01.600 align:start position:0%
bixby's bill
 
00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:02.629 align:start position:0%
bixby's bill
so

00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:02.639 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:04.160 align:start position:0%
i'll turn it over to representative
 
00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:06.479 align:start position:0%
bixby to discuss if there's any changes
 
00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:13.600 align:start position:0%
okay so i don't see any changes
 
00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:16.800 align:start position:0%
necessary for this bill i think that
 
00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:18.800 align:start position:0%
we should pass it as is it's pretty
 
00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
straightforward and i think this is
 
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
something that really does need to get
 
00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:22.870 align:start position:0%
something that really does need to get
studied

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
studied
 
00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:25.199 align:start position:0%
uh and i'd be happy to take any
 
00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:27.440 align:start position:0%
questions if people have
 
00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:32.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
so i will uh
 
00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:36.080 align:start position:0%
i'll open it up to the committee is
 
00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:38.080 align:start position:0%
there any questions for representative
 
00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:40.400 align:start position:0%
bixby or thoughts and discussion that we
 
00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:48.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
i represented all me just grab a seat
 
00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:59.270 --> 00:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
all right i see no questions from the
 
00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.150 align:start position:0%
all right i see no questions from the
committee

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:05.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
thank you good morning
 
00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:10.240 align:start position:0%
representative bixby have a question
 
00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
about is there anywhere that defines
 
00:07:16.629 --> 00:07:16.639 align:start position:0%
what a soil conditioner is
 
00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:18.400 align:start position:0%
uh that is actually one of the things
 
00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
that belongs in the study because uh the
 
00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:24.560 align:start position:0%
bill the current statute does not
 
00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
define what a soil conditioner is even
 
00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
though that is the title of the
 
00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:33.120 align:start position:0%
chapter in state law
 
00:07:37.589 --> 00:07:37.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
any further questions or discussion
 
00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
so i'll remind members of the audience
 
00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:47.360 align:start position:0%
we are in a work session and while we
 
00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
don't specifically have a in a
 
00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
way to take public testimony if you have
 
00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
some thoughts that you'd like to present
 
00:07:57.189 --> 00:07:57.199 align:start position:0%
to the committee i will certainly
 
00:07:59.430 --> 00:07:59.440 align:start position:0%
entertain it just to raise your hand and
 
00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:01.280 align:start position:0%
i'll try and call on you as soon as i
 
00:08:02.869 --> 00:08:02.879 align:start position:0%
see you or throw a pen at me or
 
00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:04.800 align:start position:0%
something if you don't get my attention
 
00:08:07.029 --> 00:08:07.039 align:start position:0%
but we'll uh we want to make you also
 
00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
involved in this if you have some good
 
00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
input that you feel the committee needs
 
00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
obviously i'm not going to be looking
 
00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:13.840 align:start position:0%
for long speeches but if you've got a
 
00:08:15.189 --> 00:08:15.199 align:start position:0%
you know a question or a point you want
 
00:08:17.029 --> 00:08:17.039 align:start position:0%
to raise please feel free to do so you
 
00:08:21.189 --> 00:08:21.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:23.840 align:start position:0%
okay 11 68 then uh
 
00:08:25.749 --> 00:08:25.759 align:start position:0%
appears we're good with that as a
 
00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
committee and everybody seems to be in
 
00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:30.560 align:start position:0%
support of ought to pass as recommended
 
00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
by representative bixby so
 
00:08:34.389 --> 00:08:34.399 align:start position:0%
we'll move on to
 
00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
house bill 1547 which is setting the
 
00:08:40.469 --> 00:08:40.479 align:start position:0%
maximum contaminant levels for pfcs in
 
00:08:43.029 --> 00:08:43.039 align:start position:0%
the soil
 
00:08:44.949 --> 00:08:44.959 align:start position:0%
we we did get
 
00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
a good amendment that was brought to the
 
00:08:49.829 --> 00:08:49.839 align:start position:0%
committee by uh representative
 
00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
maureen mooney when she introduced it
 
00:08:53.509 --> 00:08:53.519 align:start position:0%
last week
 
00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
for the life of me i can't lay my
 
00:08:58.150 --> 00:08:58.160 align:start position:0%
fingers on it right this second
 
00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:00.160 align:start position:0%
thankfully my vice chair has it
 
00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:06.720 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to open it up to the
 
00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:07.910 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to open it up to the
committee

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:09:10.389 --> 00:09:10.399 align:start position:0%
i know the the amendment
 
00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:12.720 align:start position:0%
significantly changed what the original
 
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:15.760 align:start position:0%
content of the bill was in my opinion in
 
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
a very positive manner
 
00:09:20.949 --> 00:09:20.959 align:start position:0%
so i'd like to open it up and have some
 
00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:23.680 align:start position:0%
discussion from members of the committee
 
00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
or questions obviously the prime sponsor
 
00:09:27.509 --> 00:09:27.519 align:start position:0%
isn't here but we can
 
00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:29.120 align:start position:0%
we can talk about it amongst ourselves
 
00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:29.990 align:start position:0%
we can talk about it amongst ourselves
so

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:32.080 align:start position:0%
anybody i'd like to open
 
00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
representative bixby yeah i'd like to
 
00:09:36.389 --> 00:09:36.399 align:start position:0%
say that i had
 
00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:38.080 align:start position:0%
looking at the original bill i had some
 
00:09:40.389 --> 00:09:40.399 align:start position:0%
significant questions and
 
00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
looking at the amendment i thought that
 
00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
all of my questions and more had been
 
00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
very effectively addressed and i i think
 
00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:48.080 align:start position:0%
that the
 
00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
amendment that was presented during the
 
00:09:56.389 --> 00:09:56.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:57.670 --> 00:09:57.680 align:start position:0%
any further discussion yeah
 
00:09:59.430 --> 00:09:59.440 align:start position:0%
representative duttsy no i just want to
 
00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
be uh clear because i'm going
 
00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:04.480 align:start position:0%
by one list and it's not on there are we
 
00:10:07.269 --> 00:10:07.279 align:start position:0%
talking about 15 47 yes you know what i
 
00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
looked at the wrong list i grabbed the
 
00:10:10.389 --> 00:10:10.399 align:start position:0%
hearing list instead of today's one i'll
 
00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:13.360 align:start position:0%
get back on schedule okay so it's 15 47
 
00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
i have two agendas in front of
 
00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
contaminant levels
 
00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
that's what we're on yes okay yes and i
 
00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
agree with everything that uh
 
00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
representative bixby said
 
00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:24.720 align:start position:0%
uh i thought the amendment was excellent
 
00:10:29.509 --> 00:10:29.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:37.430 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:39.680 align:start position:0%
now we'll get back on the right agenda
 
00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
house bill 1186 relative to companion
 
00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:44.240 align:start position:0%

to the committee just a short bit ago so
 
00:10:56.389 --> 00:10:56.399 align:start position:0%
many of you may not have had an
 
00:10:58.389 --> 00:10:58.399 align:start position:0%
opportunity to take a look at it did
 
00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:08.640 align:start position:0%

00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:22.069 --> 00:11:22.079 align:start position:0%
i'm going to give you just a minute to
 
00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
read through that and
 
00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
and then we'll
 
00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
everybody had a chance to read through
 
00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:17.509 align:start position:0%
everybody had a chance to read through
that

00:12:17.509 --> 00:12:17.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
any thoughts or comments from anyone on
 
00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
the committee uh representative comptoin
 
00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
um yeah
 
00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
um just looking at line 10 i think
 
00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
there's a word missing where it says uh
 
00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
animal kept an enclosure that might
 
00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:38.320 align:start position:0%
typically be found in a home not just
 
00:12:40.949 --> 00:12:40.959 align:start position:0%
typically found in home but
 
00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:42.320 align:start position:0%
um i don't know if that's an important
 
00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:44.720 align:start position:0%
word and i will refer to representative
 
00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:46.629 align:start position:0%
word and i will refer to representative
bixby

00:12:46.629 --> 00:12:46.639 align:start position:0%
bixby
 
00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:48.240 align:start position:0%
representative bixby
 
00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:50.560 align:start position:0%
uh that i think representative
 
00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
commonwealth i correctly identified a
 
00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:54.880 align:start position:0%
grammatical issue there that should be
 
00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
fixed before this goes forward but
 
00:13:00.069 --> 00:13:00.079 align:start position:0%
i actually have a content issue as well
 
00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh one of the
 
00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:02.710 align:start position:0%
uh one of the
um

00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:02.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
one thing that was brought up in
 
00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
testimony last week was that
 
00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
community shelters often don't have the
 
00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
capacity to sufficiently separate
 
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.110 align:start position:0%
capacity to sufficiently separate
animals

00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
animals
 
00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:14.069 align:start position:0%
animals
and

00:13:14.069 --> 00:13:14.079 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:13:16.949 --> 00:13:16.959 align:start position:0%
that could cause a problem
 
00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:19.120 align:start position:0%
with that part of the
 
00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:22.240 align:start position:0%
uh of the bill so i think that
 
00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
i i think including the
 
00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:27.680 align:start position:0%
uh response volunteers under the
 
00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:28.790 align:start position:0%
uh response volunteers under the
insurance

00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:32.480 align:start position:0%
uh for emergency workers does make sense
 
00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:36.160 align:start position:0%
um but uh i i think that that it does
 
00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:39.440 align:start position:0%
not do the entire fix the bill needs i
 
00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
i think that the intent of the bill is
 
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:42.870 align:start position:0%
i think that the intent of the bill is
uh

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:42.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:46.720 align:start position:0%
is good and i'd like to um make a in
 
00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
amend it in such a way that we can uh
 
00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
make it operational but i don't think
 
00:13:54.069 --> 00:13:54.079 align:start position:0%
we're there yet and i don't think that
 
00:13:54.079 --> 00:13:55.030 align:start position:0%
we're there yet and i don't think that
um

00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:56.240 align:start position:0%
i think it's going to take a little bit
 
00:13:57.990 --> 00:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
more study than what we have the
 
00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative aaron
 
00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair yeah i i would i
 
00:14:09.189 --> 00:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
would wonder
 
00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:11.920 align:start position:0%
uh representative bixby if you think
 
00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
that that line the maximum number of
 
00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
animals per family entering the hotel or
 
00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:18.720 align:start position:0%
community shelter shall comply with
 
00:14:20.389 --> 00:14:20.399 align:start position:0%
local ordinances
 
00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
and she and we can add in and shelby as
 
00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:24.150 align:start position:0%
and she and we can add in and shelby as
space

00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:24.160 align:start position:0%
space
 
00:14:27.509 --> 00:14:27.519 align:start position:0%
is available or is required
 
00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
you think something like that white
 
00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:30.790 align:start position:0%
you think something like that white
might

00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
might
 
00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
help that thought
 
00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:36.800 align:start position:0%
uh it might but i'm not um
 
00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
i'd also like to our committee
 
00:14:40.629 --> 00:14:40.639 align:start position:0%
researcher um
 
00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
gave us a a
 
00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
sheaf of research on this over email and
 
00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
i'd like to also take a look at that in
 
00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
context with this i didn't have a chance
 
00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:52.160 align:start position:0%
to print it out and i don't know if the
 
00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
um if it's
 
00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
available for us
 
00:14:58.230 --> 00:14:58.240 align:start position:0%
i don't but i i'm not sure that i think
 
00:15:00.069 --> 00:15:00.079 align:start position:0%
this is a bill that we were already
 
00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:02.160 align:start position:0%
thinking would come to another work
 
00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
session later
 
00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:05.920 align:start position:0%
uh and we're not executing it today so
 
00:15:08.069 --> 00:15:08.079 align:start position:0%
um i think that's just roughing out the
 
00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
territory that's important is i think
 
00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
the key thing rather than trying to come
 
00:15:13.829 --> 00:15:13.839 align:start position:0%
up with an exact language fix right now
 
00:15:18.069 --> 00:15:18.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:19.189 --> 00:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
yes i don't know if everybody on the
 
00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
committee saw that we
 
00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
did get an email from um
 
00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:25.360 align:start position:0%
from dan mr tory our
 
00:15:26.629 --> 00:15:26.639 align:start position:0%
researcher and there was some
 
00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:28.480 align:start position:0%
information that was provided should
 
00:15:30.629 --> 00:15:30.639 align:start position:0%
have come to you i think last evening or
 
00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:32.320 align:start position:0%
late afternoon but
 
00:15:34.629 --> 00:15:34.639 align:start position:0%
representative mola
 
00:15:36.949 --> 00:15:36.959 align:start position:0%
thank you chair um i
 
00:15:39.269 --> 00:15:39.279 align:start position:0%
i understand the intent of this bill and
 
00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:41.680 align:start position:0%
as a pet owner i'd be heartbroken if i
 
00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
had to choose between my family's safety
 
00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
and our pet being left behind
 
00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:48.320 align:start position:0%
but i do have a fundamental issue with
 
00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:50.240 align:start position:0%
requiring places that are used as
 
00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
shelters such as even hotels i mean the
 
00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
fact remains that some places just are
 
00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:55.590 align:start position:0%
fact remains that some places just are
not

00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:55.600 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:15:57.749 --> 00:15:57.759 align:start position:0%
they're not suited for pets and and
 
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:00.720 align:start position:0%
given the the range of pets also
 
00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
um you know this doesn't address any
 
00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:06.160 align:start position:0%
any kind of pets that may have more
 
00:16:07.829 --> 00:16:07.839 align:start position:0%
aggressive tendencies things that might
 
00:16:10.949 --> 00:16:10.959 align:start position:0%
not mix well with others
 
00:16:10.959 --> 00:16:12.629 align:start position:0%
not mix well with others
again

00:16:12.629 --> 00:16:12.639 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:16:14.949 --> 00:16:14.959 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm grateful that places like hotels
 
00:16:16.389 --> 00:16:16.399 align:start position:0%
will open up their door when there's
 
00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
need but but we can't let it be a
 
00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
liability for them that might cause
 
00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:23.120 align:start position:0%
potential potential damage to their
 
00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:24.230 align:start position:0%
potential potential damage to their
facility

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:24.240 align:start position:0%
facility
 
00:16:26.069 --> 00:16:26.079 align:start position:0%
and i just don't think it's fair to
 
00:16:27.749 --> 00:16:27.759 align:start position:0%
require it of them
 
00:16:30.069 --> 00:16:30.079 align:start position:0%
um i i think it's great if they wanted
 
00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:32.240 align:start position:0%
to offer that if they could be flexible
 
00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
but but it's not i think on us to
 
00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
representative murray um thank you mr
 
00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
chair for taking my comment or yeah it's
 
00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:45.440 align:start position:0%
not really a question um
 
00:16:49.189 --> 00:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
am i so in in looking at the policy here
 
00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
that was sent to us through the
 
00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
committee researcher it looks like there
 
00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
are about 48 pet shelters across the
 
00:16:57.509 --> 00:16:57.519 align:start position:0%
state that have some sort of
 
00:16:59.670 --> 00:16:59.680 align:start position:0%
policy for taking in companion animals
 
00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
at this point
 
00:17:03.829 --> 00:17:03.839 align:start position:0%
so i was curious to know if this in
 
00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
addition to
 
00:17:06.549 --> 00:17:06.559 align:start position:0%
what representative
 
00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
hamlet had mentioned
 
00:17:11.189 --> 00:17:11.199 align:start position:0%
if it would be something that an
 
00:17:11.199 --> 00:17:12.789 align:start position:0%
if it would be something that an
individual

00:17:12.789 --> 00:17:12.799 align:start position:0%
individual
 
00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
establishment might take a position on
 
00:17:16.549 --> 00:17:16.559 align:start position:0%
and invite
 
00:17:17.669 --> 00:17:17.679 align:start position:0%
folks to
 
00:17:19.590 --> 00:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
bring an animal but that would be their
 
00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:21.350 align:start position:0%
bring an animal but that would be their
own

00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
own
 
00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:24.640 align:start position:0%
purview to do so i don't
 
00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
um i'm trying to
 
00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:28.309 align:start position:0%
um i'm trying to
see

00:17:28.309 --> 00:17:28.319 align:start position:0%
see
 
00:17:29.669 --> 00:17:29.679 align:start position:0%
it also
 
00:17:29.679 --> 00:17:31.669 align:start position:0%
it also
looked

00:17:31.669 --> 00:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
looked
 
00:17:34.789 --> 00:17:34.799 align:start position:0%
like it did recognize that
 
00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:36.160 align:start position:0%
every effort
 
00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
to kind of keep animals near in
 
00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:40.240 align:start position:0%
proximity to their owners would be made
 
00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
but it couldn't guarantee that
 
00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
necessarily they could be housed in the
 
00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
dutsy did you have a question earlier
 
00:17:52.549 --> 00:17:52.559 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i think i skipped over you
 
00:17:52.559 --> 00:17:53.510 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i think i skipped over you
yeah

00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:55.440 align:start position:0%
um there's uh well there's a couple of
 
00:17:57.029 --> 00:17:57.039 align:start position:0%
things first of all i thought in the
 
00:17:58.630 --> 00:17:58.640 align:start position:0%
public hearing
 
00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:00.320 align:start position:0%
that there were some concerns about the
 
00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:02.480 align:start position:0%
term community shelter
 
00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:04.400 align:start position:0%
and whether or not
 
00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:05.669 align:start position:0%
and whether or not
that

00:18:05.669 --> 00:18:05.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
should be further defined
 
00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
and i think it was agreed by everybody
 
00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
that you know if we were looking at a
 
00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:16.160 align:start position:0%
community shelter such as a high school
 
00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
or whatever it wouldn't be appropriate
 
00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:22.480 align:start position:0%
to have a number of animals
 
00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
together in that shelter because you
 
00:18:27.909 --> 00:18:27.919 align:start position:0%
know just it would be one large room and
 
00:18:29.669 --> 00:18:29.679 align:start position:0%
it would cause a lot of problems so i
 
00:18:29.679 --> 00:18:30.390 align:start position:0%
it would cause a lot of problems so i
think

00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:30.400 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:32.960 align:start position:0%
you know that that really needs a lot of
 
00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:34.400 align:start position:0%
attention there
 
00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
and the only other thing i was going to
 
00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:37.029 align:start position:0%
and the only other thing i was going to
say

00:18:37.029 --> 00:18:37.039 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:39.200 align:start position:0%
is that in the
 
00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
rsa that was referenced i had referenced
 
00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:44.320 align:start position:0%
it when i made a note
 
00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
and after
 
00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.110 align:start position:0%
and after
um

00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
roman numeral six
 
00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
i had a small c
 
00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
okay so i don't know if that would make
 
00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:55.600 align:start position:0%
a difference in terms of what actually
 
00:18:57.750 --> 00:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
was referenced in in that but that was
 
00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:00.480 align:start position:0%
left off of this amendment also so
 
00:19:03.029 --> 00:19:03.039 align:start position:0%
any work should kind of check that out
 
00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
so there's one concern that i had
 
00:19:12.789 --> 00:19:12.799 align:start position:0%
because within this language we are
 
00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:16.400 align:start position:0%
mandating that these shelters take
 
00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:23.120 align:start position:0%
once we do that as a legislature we may
 
00:19:24.789 --> 00:19:24.799 align:start position:0%
be putting a financial burden on the
 
00:19:26.549 --> 00:19:26.559 align:start position:0%
local community to say well you know
 
00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:28.400 align:start position:0%
what my shelter isn't good enough the
 
00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
shelter that we have do we have to
 
00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:31.600 align:start position:0%
upgrade our shelter facilities because
 
00:19:33.669 --> 00:19:33.679 align:start position:0%
we are now going to have to accommodate
 
00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
companion animals along with their
 
00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:36.390 align:start position:0%
companion animals along with their
owners

00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:36.400 align:start position:0%
owners
 
00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:38.320 align:start position:0%
i just that that's a concern that i
 
00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:40.000 align:start position:0%
thought when i read it i don't know if
 
00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:42.320 align:start position:0%
it's valid but i certainly could see
 
00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
that it
 
00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
might make a community re-look at its
 
00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:46.720 align:start position:0%
facilities and think well if i'm going
 
00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
to have to accept companion animals then
 
00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
the shelter we have isn't suitable for
 
00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
that so just just a thought that i had
 
00:19:54.549 --> 00:19:54.559 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
rep murray
 
00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:57.510 align:start position:0%
rep murray
um

00:19:57.510 --> 00:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:59.190 --> 00:19:59.200 align:start position:0%
would it
 
00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
benefit to say that
 
00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:04.840 align:start position:0%
any hotel or community shelter
 
00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:06.390 align:start position:0%
any hotel or community shelter
may

00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:06.400 align:start position:0%
may
 
00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
how's i mean is that
 
00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
representative yeah um i'm not sure that
 
00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:22.640 align:start position:0%
that would change anything that already
 
00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:24.310 align:start position:0%
that would change anything that already
exists

00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:24.320 align:start position:0%
exists
 
00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:27.200 align:start position:0%
uh see because um
 
00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
i i think at this point hotels do have
 
00:20:31.669 --> 00:20:31.679 align:start position:0%
the option of
 
00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:36.400 align:start position:0%
of providing for pets if they so choose
 
00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:40.149 align:start position:0%
of providing for pets if they so choose
so

00:20:40.149 --> 00:20:40.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
rep tutsi
 
00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
but again you know this bill is in
 
00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:47.360 align:start position:0%
reference to
 
00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:50.240 align:start position:0%
a declared state of emergency so i mean
 
00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:51.760 align:start position:0%
if we look at a declared state of
 
00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:54.720 align:start position:0%
emergency like you know hurricane sandy
 
00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:56.720 align:start position:0%
or hurricane katrina
 
00:20:59.190 --> 00:20:59.200 align:start position:0%
i mean it could be i mean it's a mess i
 
00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:00.240 align:start position:0%
mean there's
 
00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:02.240 align:start position:0%
you know i mean you know we have a
 
00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:04.720 align:start position:0%
statute that says
 
00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
uh pet owners should make arrangements
 
00:21:09.909 --> 00:21:09.919 align:start position:0%
with a local shelter uh for their pets
 
00:21:12.149 --> 00:21:12.159 align:start position:0%
during an emergency but the fact of the
 
00:21:14.149 --> 00:21:14.159 align:start position:0%
matter is you know a lot of we don't
 
00:21:15.669 --> 00:21:15.679 align:start position:0%
know it's an emergency until it's
 
00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
already happened
 
00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
and if the roads are flooded
 
00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:21.280 align:start position:0%
uh you know people aren't going and we
 
00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:23.120 align:start position:0%
have no telephone service we're not
 
00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:25.280 align:start position:0%
going to be making arrangements and so i
 
00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:27.440 align:start position:0%
think when we talk again going back to
 
00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:29.200 align:start position:0%
community shelters
 
00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
in an emergency a community shelter
 
00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:35.200 align:start position:0%
could be any large public building
 
00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
so i think you know i think we really
 
00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
need to take this look at this seriously
 
00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:42.400 align:start position:0%
in terms of the context
 
00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:45.280 align:start position:0%
of a declared emergency because that's
 
00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
different than just what's going on on a
 
00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
daily basis
 
00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
rep compta
 
00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:54.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um i'm just sitting
 
00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
here listening and um
 
00:21:58.149 --> 00:21:58.159 align:start position:0%
we're talking about a declared state of
 
00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:00.640 align:start position:0%
emergency and um
 
00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
if not all of us but most of us have
 
00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:05.440 align:start position:0%
pets that we consider part of our family
 
00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:06.870 align:start position:0%
pets that we consider part of our family
um

00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:08.549 align:start position:0%
um
however

00:22:08.549 --> 00:22:08.559 align:start position:0%
however
 
00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:10.480 align:start position:0%
something just occurred to me
 
00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
is that we don't know if these pets that
 
00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
we would be putting into a community
 
00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:19.360 align:start position:0%
situation with people
 
00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:21.200 align:start position:0%
if they're up to date on their shots if
 
00:22:22.789 --> 00:22:22.799 align:start position:0%
they have any
 
00:22:22.799 --> 00:22:24.070 align:start position:0%
they have any
diseases

00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
diseases
 
00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
that could be transmitted and
 
00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:30.640 align:start position:0%
and to require businesses and things
 
00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
like that um
 
00:22:34.789 --> 00:22:34.799 align:start position:0%
what you know
 
00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
i so i agree with representative bixby
 
00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
the intent of this bill is extreme
 
00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
has been extremely well thought out but
 
00:22:43.510 --> 00:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
i really think that we need to
 
00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
study uh some of the other aspects that
 
00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:48.400 align:start position:0%
can happen during a state of emergency
 
00:22:50.390 --> 00:22:50.400 align:start position:0%
especially with animals and especially
 
00:22:57.590 --> 00:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:59.270 --> 00:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
representative vonsky
 
00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm curious if
 
00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
if this could potentially set up a
 
00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
situation where
 
00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
a shelter such as like a gymnasium or
 
00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:11.360 align:start position:0%
something which is one large open space
 
00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
would be put in a position where
 
00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
okay we've we've filled up but 20
 
00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
percent of that room is animals and then
 
00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:20.480 align:start position:0%
we have humans knocking on the door
 
00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:22.480 align:start position:0%
saying hey we want to get in
 
00:23:24.549 --> 00:23:24.559 align:start position:0%
we need shelter but there's not room
 
00:23:24.559 --> 00:23:25.909 align:start position:0%
we need shelter but there's not room
because

00:23:25.909 --> 00:23:25.919 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:23:27.669 --> 00:23:27.679 align:start position:0%
my two dogs donkey and artemis are in
 
00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
there or whatever and i'm not again i
 
00:23:32.149 --> 00:23:32.159 align:start position:0%
agree with the point of the bill i just
 
00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:34.400 align:start position:0%
i would hate for the person running a
 
00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
shelter to have to choose between or be
 
00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
put in a position where the law says
 
00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
okay we have to take these pets
 
00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
but we also kind of want to have room
 
00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
for humans as well so
 
00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
i don't know exactly
 
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
where i was going with that but i think
 
00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:47.430 align:start position:0%
where i was going with that but i think
that's

00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:47.440 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
i think we're all sort of sharing that
 
00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
same concern as how do we find that
 
00:23:57.669 --> 00:23:57.679 align:start position:0%
balance of again where
 
00:23:59.269 --> 00:23:59.279 align:start position:0%
the bill language is mandating that
 
00:24:01.669 --> 00:24:01.679 align:start position:0%
these shelters take them you know it's
 
00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:03.200 align:start position:0%
you shall do it
 
00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
and i
 
00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:06.880 align:start position:0%
well again i agree with all of you i
 
00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
understand the intent
 
00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:10.400 align:start position:0%
i think it may create a problem when
 
00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
we're already in a situation of a state
 
00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:14.320 align:start position:0%
of emergency where things could
 
00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
get a little hectic rep dutsy
 
00:24:19.269 --> 00:24:19.279 align:start position:0%
yeah i would suggest uh is this
 
00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
something that could go to a
 
00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:24.320 align:start position:0%
subcommittee um so that the the
 
00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:26.480 align:start position:0%
one the language of it could be looked
 
00:24:29.029 --> 00:24:29.039 align:start position:0%
at and also maybe a little bit it sounds
 
00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
like a little bit more research
 
00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
needs to be done and i haven't been able
 
00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:34.549 align:start position:0%
needs to be done and i haven't been able
to

00:24:34.549 --> 00:24:34.559 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
you know read in depth what uh mr torrey
 
00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
wrote here but
 
00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
just looking at it it looks like this is
 
00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
fairly general and it i mean it would be
 
00:24:45.909 --> 00:24:45.919 align:start position:0%
very interesting to see maybe what the
 
00:24:49.029 --> 00:24:49.039 align:start position:0%
state i mean has the state of louisiana
 
00:24:51.029 --> 00:24:51.039 align:start position:0%
put any of these
 
00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
laws into effect after katrina or
 
00:24:57.430 --> 00:24:57.440 align:start position:0%
new jersey after sandy and maybe you
 
00:24:59.430 --> 00:24:59.440 align:start position:0%
know if we had some law that we could
 
00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:01.440 align:start position:0%
look at we might be able to do better
 
00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
job of it so i would recommend a
 
00:25:07.669 --> 00:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
it is not an early bill it's not due out
 
00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:11.440 align:start position:0%
until march 10th so we do have a little
 
00:25:13.269 --> 00:25:13.279 align:start position:0%
time we can work on it so certainly take
 
00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
that under advisor
 
00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:17.350 align:start position:0%
that under advisor
representative

00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:17.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
if i could just add to that thank you
 
00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:19.510 align:start position:0%
if i could just add to that thank you
sir

00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
sir
 
00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:20.960 align:start position:0%
i mean i think that what we're talking
 
00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:23.200 align:start position:0%
about is do do we or do we not require
 
00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:26.480 align:start position:0%
hotels to take pets you know in the gist
 
00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:28.480 align:start position:0%
of it and i'm not sure any amount of
 
00:25:29.669 --> 00:25:29.679 align:start position:0%
studying is going to change that
 
00:25:29.679 --> 00:25:30.789 align:start position:0%
studying is going to change that
question

00:25:30.789 --> 00:25:30.799 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:32.960 align:start position:0%
it's either we are going to put this
 
00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:35.200 align:start position:0%
burden on hotels and shelters or we're
 
00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:36.310 align:start position:0%
burden on hotels and shelters or we're
not

00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:36.320 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
so i just wanted to to add that on there
 
00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
i do think it would be valuable
 
00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:42.320 align:start position:0%
information for the committee to
 
00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:44.240 align:start position:0%
understand how perhaps other states have
 
00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:46.720 align:start position:0%
done this you know we certainly can
 
00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
use that input not that we necessarily
 
00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
always follow that but it's always good
 
00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
guidance to see if there's a good idea
 
00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:58.390 --> 00:25:58.400 align:start position:0%
any other thoughts and comments on
 
00:26:00.549 --> 00:26:00.559 align:start position:0%
oh yes
 
00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
yes um so i think that um
 
00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
we actually probably have a fair amount
 
00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:08.240 align:start position:0%
of leeway in terms of how we could amend
 
00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
amend this and uh in the research that
 
00:26:15.909 --> 00:26:15.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
there were
 
00:26:20.149 --> 00:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
one of the things that was mentioned was
 
00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:22.960 align:start position:0%
what policies are in place for making
 
00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
sure that pets are reunited with their
 
00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:27.440 align:start position:0%
owners after they've been in a shelter
 
00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
during an emergency and it sounds like
 
00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:32.480 align:start position:0%
there's a range of that from
 
00:26:35.909 --> 00:26:35.919 align:start position:0%
uh good luck to uh there
 
00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:38.400 align:start position:0%
you need to actually have a system for
 
00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:40.480 align:start position:0%
um making sure people are reunited with
 
00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
their pets
 
00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:42.950 align:start position:0%
their pets
and

00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:44.070 align:start position:0%
and
um

00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
so we could
 
00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:48.240 align:start position:0%
uh that's something we might want to
 
00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
look into in in the course of studying
 
00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:52.480 align:start position:0%
to see if
 
00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:53.440 align:start position:0%
we can
 
00:26:56.870 --> 00:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
make sure that there is a uh that i
 
00:26:58.710 --> 00:26:58.720 align:start position:0%
think massachusetts
 
00:27:01.909 --> 00:27:01.919 align:start position:0%
uh requires that pets be in a
 
00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
separate shelter that is relatively
 
00:27:05.909 --> 00:27:05.919 align:start position:0%
close to
 
00:27:05.919 --> 00:27:06.630 align:start position:0%
close to
the

00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:06.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
where their families are sheltered
 
00:27:12.149 --> 00:27:12.159 align:start position:0%
uh and has some some mechanisms in place
 
00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:14.480 align:start position:0%
for making sure that they're reunited
 
00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
uh it sounds like there were a couple of
 
00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:19.360 align:start position:0%
states where it was like okay well
 
00:27:20.549 --> 00:27:20.559 align:start position:0%
uh if
 
00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:22.480 align:start position:0%
the owner doesn't come and claim their
 
00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
animal after a certain amount of time it
 
00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
gets put down
 
00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:26.389 align:start position:0%
gets put down
so

00:27:26.389 --> 00:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:27:28.549 --> 00:27:28.559 align:start position:0%
i think we probably want to be closer to
 
00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
massachusetts than putting down people's
 
00:27:32.789 --> 00:27:32.799 align:start position:0%
pets because they can't find them
 
00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:34.480 align:start position:0%
but i think that's that's the business
 
00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
that's what would
 
00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:38.640 align:start position:0%
be proper to do in a study or you know
 
00:27:44.149 --> 00:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:45.909 --> 00:27:45.919 align:start position:0%
uh representative murray
 
00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:47.840 align:start position:0%
yes also um one of the things that i
 
00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
think i remember in the testimony that i
 
00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:51.440 align:start position:0%
would like to see
 
00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:52.310 align:start position:0%
would like to see
um

00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:54.080 align:start position:0%
maybe touched upon
 
00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
additionally is the comment around um
 
00:27:59.110 --> 00:27:59.120 align:start position:0%
when we talked about the definition of
 
00:28:00.789 --> 00:28:00.799 align:start position:0%
shelters i think there were these
 
00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
emergency trailers too that were being
 
00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:04.880 align:start position:0%
used and so my question is do those
 
00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
constitute as a shelter if so is that
 
00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:11.120 align:start position:0%
included in the definition for the bill
 
00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:13.120 align:start position:0%
and if you know if that shelter is on
 
00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
site at a hotel parking lot for example
 
00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:17.600 align:start position:0%
does that satisfy that requirement or
 
00:28:21.029 --> 00:28:21.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
representative dutsy
 
00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:23.590 align:start position:0%
representative dutsy
yeah

00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:28:25.909 --> 00:28:25.919 align:start position:0%
just for clarification i was looking at
 
00:28:30.149 --> 00:28:30.159 align:start position:0%
mr torrey's uh i think
 
00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
and it says here on page four
 
00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
none of the state laws regulations or
 
00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
plans as of this
 
00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
as of the writing of this memo
 
00:28:42.549 --> 00:28:42.559 align:start position:0%
require all hotels and community
 
00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
shelters statewide to shelter pets with
 
00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
their owners
 
00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:54.310 align:start position:0%
 
state

00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:54.320 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:28:56.710 --> 00:28:56.720 align:start position:0%
that they require hotels so that i think
 
00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:12.789 --> 00:29:12.799 align:start position:0%
all right i'm going to uh look through
 
00:29:12.799 --> 00:29:13.590 align:start position:0%
all right i'm going to uh look through
our

00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:13.600 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:15.430 align:start position:0%
our
subcommittee

00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:15.440 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
00:29:18.549 --> 00:29:18.559 align:start position:0%
availability and i'll certainly take a
 
00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:21.200 align:start position:0%
take that under consideration and
 
00:29:22.549 --> 00:29:22.559 align:start position:0%
when i get a chance to look through that
 
00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:25.120 align:start position:0%
list then i think we'll make a decision
 
00:29:27.510 --> 00:29:27.520 align:start position:0%
where this should go
 
00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:29.200 align:start position:0%
anything further before we move on to
 
00:29:31.909 --> 00:29:31.919 align:start position:0%
the next bill anybody in the audience
 
00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:36.640 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:39.190 align:start position:0%
all right
okay

00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:42.789 --> 00:29:42.799 align:start position:0%
we will move on to house bill 1226
 
00:29:51.510 --> 00:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:53.440 align:start position:0%
so we received a lot of
 
00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:55.520 align:start position:0%
testimony on this bill that was a rather
 
00:29:58.950 --> 00:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:00.789 --> 00:30:00.799 align:start position:0%
i guess i'll throw it out to the
 
00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
committee and kind of see where
 
00:30:04.310 --> 00:30:04.320 align:start position:0%
where everybody is if there's any
 
00:30:06.389 --> 00:30:06.399 align:start position:0%
thoughts on work that needs to be done
 
00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:16.870 align:start position:0%
 
everybody's

00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
oh representative bixby yeah
 
00:30:22.549 --> 00:30:22.559 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
00:30:22.559 --> 00:30:23.430 align:start position:0%
excuse me
so

00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:23.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:25.350 align:start position:0%
so
i

00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:25.360 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:28.240 align:start position:0%
i think the the practice of
 
00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:31.840 align:start position:0%
uh declining cats is basically a bad
 
00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:32.950 align:start position:0%
uh declining cats is basically a bad
practice

00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:32.960 align:start position:0%
practice
 
00:30:34.789 --> 00:30:34.799 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
00:30:34.799 --> 00:30:35.669 align:start position:0%
uh and
we

00:30:35.669 --> 00:30:35.679 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:30:37.909 --> 00:30:37.919 align:start position:0%
on the other hand we didn't hear
 
00:30:37.919 --> 00:30:38.870 align:start position:0%
on the other hand we didn't hear
um

00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:41.440 align:start position:0%
we didn't hear much testimony saying
 
00:30:43.430 --> 00:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
to what extent this is an issue in new
 
00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:44.710 align:start position:0%
to what extent this is an issue in new
hampshire

00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:44.720 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:45.430 align:start position:0%
hampshire
so

00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:45.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:30:47.909 --> 00:30:47.919 align:start position:0%
uh that it kind of puts me on the fence
 
00:30:49.029 --> 00:30:49.039 align:start position:0%
with this bill
 
00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
one of the things i really don't like
 
00:30:54.789 --> 00:30:54.799 align:start position:0%
about this bill is that it criminalizes
 
00:30:57.750 --> 00:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
the veterinarian who performs it
 
00:31:00.149 --> 00:31:00.159 align:start position:0%
i think that that aspect of it would be
 
00:31:00.159 --> 00:31:01.509 align:start position:0%
i think that that aspect of it would be
unacceptable

00:31:01.509 --> 00:31:01.519 align:start position:0%
unacceptable
 
00:31:04.149 --> 00:31:04.159 align:start position:0%
i could imagine having some sort of
 
00:31:06.230 --> 00:31:06.240 align:start position:0%
statement in law saying that this
 
00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:08.720 align:start position:0%
practice is discouraged
 
00:31:13.350 --> 00:31:13.360 align:start position:0%
uh so it might need amendment but uh
 
00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:16.720 align:start position:0%
i don't i uh i certainly could not pass
 
00:31:21.190 --> 00:31:21.200 align:start position:0%
the bill as is uh but i would consider
 
00:31:24.549 --> 00:31:24.559 align:start position:0%
uh an amendment on it
 
00:31:26.789 --> 00:31:26.799 align:start position:0%
representative dutsy
 
00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
um yes uh
 
00:31:33.669 --> 00:31:33.679 align:start position:0%
i uh i strongly support this bill
 
00:31:33.679 --> 00:31:35.269 align:start position:0%
i uh i strongly support this bill
because

00:31:35.269 --> 00:31:35.279 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
cats scratch
 
00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:38.640 align:start position:0%
dogs bark
 
00:31:40.630 --> 00:31:40.640 align:start position:0%
and kids run
 
00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
and that's just the way life is and if
 
00:31:45.990 --> 00:31:46.000 align:start position:0%
you can't accept that then maybe you
 
00:31:49.669 --> 00:31:49.679 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have a dog a cat or a child
 
00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
but i understand what
 
00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
representative bixby is saying and i
 
00:31:57.909 --> 00:31:57.919 align:start position:0%
went back and looked at our 2020 bill
 
00:31:59.389 --> 00:31:59.399 align:start position:0%
which was hb
 
00:32:02.789 --> 00:32:02.799 align:start position:0%
1387 which was almost identical to the
 
00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:05.440 align:start position:0%
bill that we've been presented
 
00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:08.240 align:start position:0%
except for the fact that it said any
 
00:32:10.710 --> 00:32:10.720 align:start position:0%
person licensed or certified under this
 
00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
chapter who removes the clause of a cat
 
00:32:16.149 --> 00:32:16.159 align:start position:0%
in violation of paragraph one
 
00:32:18.549 --> 00:32:18.559 align:start position:0%
shall be punishable by a fine to be
 
00:32:20.389 --> 00:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
determined by the board of veterinary
 
00:32:20.399 --> 00:32:21.430 align:start position:0%
determined by the board of veterinary
medicine

00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:21.440 align:start position:0%
medicine
 
00:32:24.149 --> 00:32:24.159 align:start position:0%
not to exceed five hundred dollars
 
00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:26.320 align:start position:0%
and i think that would would be
 
00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:28.720 align:start position:0%
appropriate because then you could have
 
00:32:31.029 --> 00:32:31.039 align:start position:0%
the veterinary board and i know that
 
00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:32.320 align:start position:0%
there is
 
00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
some concerns about that board but still
 
00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:36.880 align:start position:0%
you could have a veterinary board
 
00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
look at it and make a determination
 
00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
and you know there there may be at no
 
00:32:45.669 --> 00:32:45.679 align:start position:0%
fine whatsoever because it because it
 
00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:47.360 align:start position:0%
addressed the concerns that one
 
00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:48.710 align:start position:0%
addressed the concerns that one
veterinarian

00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:48.720 align:start position:0%
veterinarian
 
00:32:51.190 --> 00:32:51.200 align:start position:0%
had at the public meeting was what
 
00:32:52.549 --> 00:32:52.559 align:start position:0%
happens if
 
00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
an animal comes in with a tumor i have
 
00:32:57.110 --> 00:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
to remove the tumor but then i also
 
00:32:59.669 --> 00:32:59.679 align:start position:0%
realize that i have to remove
 
00:33:01.110 --> 00:33:01.120 align:start position:0%
other digits
 
00:33:03.990 --> 00:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
on the on the paw
 
00:33:06.149 --> 00:33:06.159 align:start position:0%
because of
 
00:33:07.509 --> 00:33:07.519 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:10.880 align:start position:0%
a more invasive process so i think
 
00:33:12.389 --> 00:33:12.399 align:start position:0%
that this
 
00:33:15.269 --> 00:33:15.279 align:start position:0%
if we added this amendment to it
 
00:33:17.909 --> 00:33:17.919 align:start position:0%
that it would protect the veterinarians
 
00:33:21.509 --> 00:33:21.519 align:start position:0%
but this law would also give them a tool
 
00:33:25.509 --> 00:33:25.519 align:start position:0%
as a response to use for some aggressive
 
00:33:27.990 --> 00:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
clients of theirs who they do not want
 
00:33:29.669 --> 00:33:29.679 align:start position:0%
to offend
 
00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
but it gives them the you know the added
 
00:33:36.549 --> 00:33:36.559 align:start position:0%
backing that by law they can't do this
 
00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
for cosmetic reasons only
 
00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
okay and and that's really what we're
 
00:33:43.029 --> 00:33:43.039 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
00:33:45.029 --> 00:33:45.039 align:start position:0%
is that this bill
 
00:33:48.630 --> 00:33:48.640 align:start position:0%
you know um bans declawing
 
00:33:52.789 --> 00:33:52.799 align:start position:0%
um for the convenience of the owner
 
00:33:57.190 --> 00:33:57.200 align:start position:0%
and again cats scratch dogs bark and
 
00:33:58.710 --> 00:33:58.720 align:start position:0%
kids run
 
00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:01.440 align:start position:0%
and so i i see that this is a very
 
00:34:03.029 --> 00:34:03.039 align:start position:0%
reasonable bill
 
00:34:08.069 --> 00:34:08.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:08.079 --> 00:34:10.629 align:start position:0%
 
perez

00:34:10.629 --> 00:34:10.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:13.270 --> 00:34:13.280 align:start position:0%
yeah um i just want to say that um
 
00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
the the way the bill is right now
 
00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:18.320 align:start position:0%
i cannot support it especially when it
 
00:34:21.909 --> 00:34:21.919 align:start position:0%
talks about criminal penalties um
 
00:34:21.919 --> 00:34:23.349 align:start position:0%
talks about criminal penalties um
i

00:34:23.349 --> 00:34:23.359 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:34:25.829 --> 00:34:25.839 align:start position:0%
been trying to see any other state that
 
00:34:28.149 --> 00:34:28.159 align:start position:0%
they have criminal penalties for these
 
00:34:29.990 --> 00:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
00:34:31.990 --> 00:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
problems but i haven't find anything
 
00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:34.720 align:start position:0%
that i can really see it clear
 
00:34:36.629 --> 00:34:36.639 align:start position:0%
for that reason not
 
00:34:38.389 --> 00:34:38.399 align:start position:0%
the way that the devil is right now that
 
00:34:38.399 --> 00:34:39.270 align:start position:0%
the way that the devil is right now that
i

00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:39.280 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:34:42.950 --> 00:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:45.909 --> 00:34:45.919 align:start position:0%
thank you rep mason
 
00:34:45.919 --> 00:34:47.030 align:start position:0%
thank you rep mason
yeah

00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:34:49.669 --> 00:34:49.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair over the weekend i
 
00:34:51.589 --> 00:34:51.599 align:start position:0%
spent some time with
 
00:34:53.109 --> 00:34:53.119 align:start position:0%
small animal veterinarian friends of
 
00:34:56.470 --> 00:34:56.480 align:start position:0%
mine and and i ran this past them
 
00:34:58.630 --> 00:34:58.640 align:start position:0%
and the ones i spoke to said they don't
 
00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:00.640 align:start position:0%
remember the last time that they
 
00:35:03.109 --> 00:35:03.119 align:start position:0%
declawed a cat in recent years other
 
00:35:05.109 --> 00:35:05.119 align:start position:0%
than for a medical reason so i think
 
00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:06.800 align:start position:0%
we're chasing something
 
00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
that has
 
00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:13.760 align:start position:0%
issues today at new hampshire
 
00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:14.550 align:start position:0%
issues today at new hampshire
and

00:35:14.550 --> 00:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:16.960 align:start position:0%
as i heard in testimony there's only one
 
00:35:19.829 --> 00:35:19.839 align:start position:0%
state that has a law against this
 
00:35:23.990 --> 00:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
so i think from my own perspective well
 
00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
i certainly
 
00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
respect all the things that the points
 
00:35:31.829 --> 00:35:31.839 align:start position:0%
that have been brought why
 
00:35:33.670 --> 00:35:33.680 align:start position:0%
it should be in favor of
 
00:35:34.870 --> 00:35:34.880 align:start position:0%
declawing i
 
00:35:37.109 --> 00:35:37.119 align:start position:0%
think i tend to agree that
 
00:35:38.870 --> 00:35:38.880 align:start position:0%
the testimony seemed to be pretty strong
 
00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:40.720 align:start position:0%
from my perspective that there wasn't
 
00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
this isn't really a big new hampshire
 
00:35:45.829 --> 00:35:45.839 align:start position:0%
problem and that
 
00:35:49.349 --> 00:35:49.359 align:start position:0%
i always struggle with getting into
 
00:35:50.950 --> 00:35:50.960 align:start position:0%
into the
 
00:35:53.190 --> 00:35:53.200 align:start position:0%
realm of dealing with veterinary patient
 
00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
interaction and while i
 
00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:56.640 align:start position:0%
certainly would be respectful
 
00:35:58.310 --> 00:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
representative dutzy to your position
 
00:36:00.310 --> 00:36:00.320 align:start position:0%
that this would give the vets a tool to
 
00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
say no i think they already have the
 
00:36:03.990 --> 00:36:04.000 align:start position:0%
tools to say no from my opinion if they
 
00:36:06.069 --> 00:36:06.079 align:start position:0%
choose to is it's not a good idea and i
 
00:36:07.589 --> 00:36:07.599 align:start position:0%
won't perform that practice for you i
 
00:36:10.390 --> 00:36:10.400 align:start position:0%
don't recommend it i think that
 
00:36:12.230 --> 00:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
that option is already available for a
 
00:36:14.390 --> 00:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
veterinary to to say to their client and
 
00:36:16.069 --> 00:36:16.079 align:start position:0%
i think that's very much part of the
 
00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:18.160 align:start position:0%
care and the responsibility that
 
00:36:19.589 --> 00:36:19.599 align:start position:0%
veterinarians take when they take their
 
00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
oath that they're going to give their
 
00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
clients the you know the best guidance
 
00:36:26.310 --> 00:36:26.320 align:start position:0%
as far as the care and health for their
 
00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:27.589 align:start position:0%
as far as the care and health for their
pets

00:36:27.589 --> 00:36:27.599 align:start position:0%
pets
 
00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:29.680 align:start position:0%
i think at that point if any
 
00:36:32.069 --> 00:36:32.079 align:start position:0%
most any veterinary i know anyway would
 
00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:33.280 align:start position:0%
if the
 
00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
client kept pushing it they would
 
00:36:36.069 --> 00:36:36.079 align:start position:0%
decline and ask them to find another
 
00:36:37.349 --> 00:36:37.359 align:start position:0%
veterinary to perform that practice
 
00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
because they didn't feel it was in the
 
00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:40.640 align:start position:0%
best interest of the animal so from my
 
00:36:43.030 --> 00:36:43.040 align:start position:0%
perspective having a lot of years in
 
00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:43.990 align:start position:0%
perspective having a lot of years in
animal

00:36:43.990 --> 00:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
animal
 
00:36:46.069 --> 00:36:46.079 align:start position:0%
husbandry that's uh i've certainly had
 
00:36:48.230 --> 00:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
conversations in detail with with my
 
00:36:50.310 --> 00:36:50.320 align:start position:0%
veterinary over the animals that you
 
00:36:53.349 --> 00:36:53.359 align:start position:0%
know were sick or needed some care and
 
00:36:55.349 --> 00:36:55.359 align:start position:0%
i always respected the opinion of my
 
00:36:56.630 --> 00:36:56.640 align:start position:0%
veterinary so
 
00:36:58.630 --> 00:36:58.640 align:start position:0%
that would be my thought anybody else my
 
00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:00.400 align:start position:0%
way in rep aaron
 
00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:37:04.150 --> 00:37:04.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i i happened to speak
 
00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
with my own veterinarian this week as i
 
00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:08.640 align:start position:0%
took my cats in for their annual checkup
 
00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:10.240 align:start position:0%
and i asked her the question about it
 
00:37:12.310 --> 00:37:12.320 align:start position:0%
and she said that
 
00:37:14.310 --> 00:37:14.320 align:start position:0%
she can't even remember the last time
 
00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:16.240 align:start position:0%
she did any kind of declaw in her
 
00:37:19.829 --> 00:37:19.839 align:start position:0%
practice and that in her practice
 
00:37:22.230 --> 00:37:22.240 align:start position:0%
she only knows of one cat that's
 
00:37:24.470 --> 00:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
declawed as a you know one of her
 
00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:25.750 align:start position:0%
declawed as a you know one of her
patients

00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
patients
 
00:37:28.150 --> 00:37:28.160 align:start position:0%
so i again i'd have to
 
00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
echo what you've just said in so far as
 
00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:32.640 align:start position:0%
i don't really think that this is a new
 
00:37:35.829 --> 00:37:35.839 align:start position:0%
hampshire issue or that it is an issue i
 
00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
don't think veterinarians for the most
 
00:37:45.109 --> 00:37:45.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:51.589 --> 00:37:51.599 align:start position:0%
rep control uh mason i'd ask you shut
 
00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:53.280 align:start position:0%
your mic off
 
00:37:54.310 --> 00:37:54.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:37:55.750 --> 00:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:57.670 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
um

00:37:57.670 --> 00:37:57.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:59.670 --> 00:37:59.680 align:start position:0%
you know this is the third time i've
 
00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:01.200 align:start position:0%
heard this bill
 
00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:02.870 align:start position:0%
heard this bill
and

00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
every time every year we have asked what
 
00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
the number of
 
00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:08.230 align:start position:0%
the number of
animals

00:38:08.230 --> 00:38:08.240 align:start position:0%
animals
 
00:38:10.390 --> 00:38:10.400 align:start position:0%
on a yearly basis are being declawed in
 
00:38:12.310 --> 00:38:12.320 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and we get the national
 
00:38:14.950 --> 00:38:14.960 align:start position:0%
figure of 20-25 percent
 
00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:18.560 align:start position:0%
but as we sit here and i listen to folks
 
00:38:19.990 --> 00:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
who've talked to the veterinarians and
 
00:38:23.670 --> 00:38:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:25.990 --> 00:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
it is the practice of them to discourage
 
00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:28.640 align:start position:0%
they do not like to perform this
 
00:38:30.310 --> 00:38:30.320 align:start position:0%
procedure unless it is medically
 
00:38:32.870 --> 00:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
necessary and they actually discourage
 
00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
it from my understanding and talking
 
00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
with my vet um
 
00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:38.640 align:start position:0%
for any other reason
 
00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
and i think we heard from some other
 
00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:42.069 align:start position:0%
and i think we heard from some other
veterinarians

00:38:42.069 --> 00:38:42.079 align:start position:0%
veterinarians
 
00:38:43.990 --> 00:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
and all of us here could probably go and
 
00:38:46.069 --> 00:38:46.079 align:start position:0%
speak to our veterinarians and ask how
 
00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:49.040 align:start position:0%
many do d-clause do you do a year and i
 
00:38:50.550 --> 00:38:50.560 align:start position:0%
don't think you're going to get the 20
 
00:38:53.990 --> 00:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
25 to 25 percent figure that we've been
 
00:38:56.550 --> 00:38:56.560 align:start position:0%
uh that's been touted uh over the last
 
00:39:01.510 --> 00:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
any further thoughts or comments from
 
00:39:05.430 --> 00:39:05.440 align:start position:0%
the committee reptusi
 
00:39:07.510 --> 00:39:07.520 align:start position:0%
i'll ask the committee what's the
 
00:39:09.910 --> 00:39:09.920 align:start position:0%
downside of passing this bill
 
00:39:12.310 --> 00:39:12.320 align:start position:0%
if it's amended to take out
 
00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:13.430 align:start position:0%
if it's amended to take out
criminal

00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
criminal
 
00:39:18.950 --> 00:39:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:20.310 --> 00:39:20.320 align:start position:0%
anybody else want to feel do you want me
 
00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:22.950 align:start position:0%
anybody else want to feel do you want me
to

00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:24.640 align:start position:0%
well from my perspective again i won't
 
00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
speak for the committee
 
00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
my perspective is it's we're putting
 
00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:30.640 align:start position:0%
another law on the books that isn't
 
00:39:32.310 --> 00:39:32.320 align:start position:0%
really solving something that's a
 
00:39:33.829 --> 00:39:33.839 align:start position:0%
problem in new hampshire i think our
 
00:39:36.390 --> 00:39:36.400 align:start position:0%
veterinaries that do a really good job
 
00:39:38.790 --> 00:39:38.800 align:start position:0%
in deciding what is appropriate care for
 
00:39:41.190 --> 00:39:41.200 align:start position:0%
the animals for their clients animals
 
00:39:42.950 --> 00:39:42.960 align:start position:0%
and i i just don't see that this is a
 
00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
problem that rises to the level of
 
00:39:47.109 --> 00:39:47.119 align:start position:0%
requiring more legislation i think that
 
00:39:48.230 --> 00:39:48.240 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:39:51.589 --> 00:39:51.599 align:start position:0%
a practice that is already done with
 
00:39:54.790 --> 00:39:54.800 align:start position:0%
with care and and thought in by the
 
00:39:56.310 --> 00:39:56.320 align:start position:0%
members of our veterinary community in
 
00:39:58.630 --> 00:39:58.640 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and i just don't think
 
00:40:00.150 --> 00:40:00.160 align:start position:0%
that we need to regulate them on that
 
00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
decision i think it's they're doing a
 
00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
very good and conscientious job on their
 
00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:05.430 align:start position:0%
very good and conscientious job on their
own

00:40:05.430 --> 00:40:05.440 align:start position:0%
own
 
00:40:08.069 --> 00:40:08.079 align:start position:0%
rep dutsy
 
00:40:09.750 --> 00:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
last comment
 
00:40:12.470 --> 00:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
i have a constituent who will only have
 
00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:14.640 align:start position:0%
declawed cats
 
00:40:17.109 --> 00:40:17.119 align:start position:0%
because she
 
00:40:21.030 --> 00:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
feels that her vintage furniture
 
00:40:23.750 --> 00:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
would be destroyed so she's obviously
 
00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
getting these declawed cats from some
 
00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:27.430 align:start position:0%
getting these declawed cats from some
place

00:40:27.430 --> 00:40:27.440 align:start position:0%
place
 
00:40:28.710 --> 00:40:28.720 align:start position:0%
so i
 
00:40:31.589 --> 00:40:31.599 align:start position:0%
i just wonder about i mean i know it's
 
00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:34.720 align:start position:0%
not as prevalent as it used to be
 
00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:38.960 align:start position:0%
but i believe it's still out there
 
00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:40.720 align:start position:0%
any further comments from the members of
 
00:40:43.349 --> 00:40:43.359 align:start position:0%
the committee representative perez
 
00:40:45.109 --> 00:40:45.119 align:start position:0%
yeah i don't still
 
00:40:46.870 --> 00:40:46.880 align:start position:0%
i don't see these bills necessary for
 
00:40:48.230 --> 00:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
our state because
 
00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:50.720 align:start position:0%
to be honest like we could continue
 
00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:54.240 align:start position:0%
someone else has said already 25 25
 
00:40:56.710 --> 00:40:56.720 align:start position:0%
nationally but in new hampshire i don't
 
00:40:59.030 --> 00:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
see that necessary for us to put another
 
00:41:03.109 --> 00:41:03.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:05.750 --> 00:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
any further comments
 
00:41:07.990 --> 00:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
representative von plinsky
 
00:41:09.750 --> 00:41:09.760 align:start position:0%
uh thank you thank you mr i don't just
 
00:41:11.589 --> 00:41:11.599 align:start position:0%
necessarily disagree with you and
 
00:41:14.390 --> 00:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
i i do wonder just from a
 
00:41:16.950 --> 00:41:16.960 align:start position:0%
abstract point of view at what point
 
00:41:18.309 --> 00:41:18.319 align:start position:0%
does something
 
00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
how many times does something have to
 
00:41:21.430 --> 00:41:21.440 align:start position:0%
happen before
 
00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
it rises to the level of legislation um
 
00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:26.640 align:start position:0%
again i'm not saying that you're wrong
 
00:41:28.390 --> 00:41:28.400 align:start position:0%
on this one or that any of us i just
 
00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
that that question keeps coming up when
 
00:41:33.990 --> 00:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
we when when that reason is used
 
00:41:36.069 --> 00:41:36.079 align:start position:0%
no no and that's probably a different
 
00:41:37.510 --> 00:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
level for everybody you know to make
 
00:41:40.230 --> 00:41:40.240 align:start position:0%
that decision but uh i'm you know i sort
 
00:41:41.910 --> 00:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
of i gave you my opinion and
 
00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
representative comptoa
 
00:41:45.589 --> 00:41:45.599 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:41:45.599 --> 00:41:46.470 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
um

00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:46.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:49.589 --> 00:41:49.599 align:start position:0%
so in seeing this bill come back year
 
00:41:51.589 --> 00:41:51.599 align:start position:0%
aft you know year after year
 
00:41:53.349 --> 00:41:53.359 align:start position:0%
and listening to the folks that
 
00:41:53.359 --> 00:41:55.030 align:start position:0%
and listening to the folks that
testified

00:41:55.030 --> 00:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
testified
 
00:41:57.430 --> 00:41:57.440 align:start position:0%
it seemed that this was a problem
 
00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:00.560 align:start position:0%
many years ago it was common practice
 
00:42:02.470 --> 00:42:02.480 align:start position:0%
but as veterinarians have learned and
 
00:42:04.470 --> 00:42:04.480 align:start position:0%
their their concern is for the health of
 
00:42:06.069 --> 00:42:06.079 align:start position:0%
their the animal
 
00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
um and i believe that most veterinarians
 
00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:10.790 align:start position:0%
um and i believe that most veterinarians
um

00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:11.990 --> 00:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
there's a reason that a lot of
 
00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
veterinarians do not practice or declaw
 
00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
because they see that
 
00:42:18.550 --> 00:42:18.560 align:start position:0%
it may not be in the best interest of
 
00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
the animal
 
00:42:22.230 --> 00:42:22.240 align:start position:0%
but to put this into law and even have a
 
00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
small penalty
 
00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:24.630 align:start position:0%
small penalty
might

00:42:24.630 --> 00:42:24.640 align:start position:0%
might
 
00:42:26.309 --> 00:42:26.319 align:start position:0%
put into question a veterinarian who
 
00:42:28.309 --> 00:42:28.319 align:start position:0%
might be performing a medical procedure
 
00:42:31.030 --> 00:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
and say well if i have to remove this
 
00:42:32.790 --> 00:42:32.800 align:start position:0%
tumor and may have to remove another
 
00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:34.230 align:start position:0%
tumor and may have to remove another
digit

00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:34.240 align:start position:0%
digit
 
00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:36.240 align:start position:0%
but it's questionable
 
00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:42:39.589 --> 00:42:39.599 align:start position:0%
where are they going to draw the line
 
00:42:41.510 --> 00:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
and i think that we need to let the
 
00:42:43.430 --> 00:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
veterinarians practice the best medicine
 
00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:50.069 --> 00:42:50.079 align:start position:0%
any further thoughts and comments from
 
00:42:52.550 --> 00:42:52.560 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:54.400 align:start position:0%
i think we've had a
 
00:42:56.710 --> 00:42:56.720 align:start position:0%
pretty good discussion on this bill as a
 
00:42:58.390 --> 00:42:58.400 align:start position:0%
committee and i certainly appreciate all
 
00:43:02.950 --> 00:43:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:05.349 --> 00:43:05.359 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm not getting the feeling that
 
00:43:05.359 --> 00:43:06.630 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm not getting the feeling that
a

00:43:06.630 --> 00:43:06.640 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:43:08.230 --> 00:43:08.240 align:start position:0%
further work session on this bill would
 
00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
really solve
 
00:43:11.190 --> 00:43:11.200 align:start position:0%
the divisions in
 
00:43:13.430 --> 00:43:13.440 align:start position:0%
in the opinions of the members of the
 
00:43:15.589 --> 00:43:15.599 align:start position:0%
committee so i
 
00:43:17.430 --> 00:43:17.440 align:start position:0%
i'm feeling that we'll put this bill
 
00:43:19.109 --> 00:43:19.119 align:start position:0%
when we go into exact section we'll
 
00:43:21.190 --> 00:43:21.200 align:start position:0%
bring it forward and we'll see how that
 
00:43:24.829 --> 00:43:24.839 align:start position:0%
goes from there everybody okay with it
 
00:43:24.839 --> 00:43:26.390 align:start position:0%
goes from there everybody okay with it
okay

00:43:26.390 --> 00:43:26.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:30.720 align:start position:0%
okay then we'll uh we will move on to uh
 
00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:33.200 align:start position:0%
house bill 1454
 
00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:34.960 align:start position:0%
relative to the permits for the sighting
 
00:43:37.190 --> 00:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
of new landfills
 
00:43:39.589 --> 00:43:39.599 align:start position:0%
we do have an amendment
 
00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
here that
 
00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
representative tucker sent for us
 
00:43:53.109 --> 00:43:53.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:54.630 --> 00:43:54.640 align:start position:0%
and i do see that representative tucker
 
00:43:55.910 --> 00:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
is here would you like to come and speak
 
00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:07.109 --> 00:44:07.119 align:start position:0%
turn the mic on please
 
00:44:09.030 --> 00:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
i take it this is uh you would like to
 
00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:11.200 align:start position:0%
have this very brief yeah we're gonna
 
00:44:13.829 --> 00:44:13.839 align:start position:0%
would it's not my intent to do a lot of
 
00:44:15.750 --> 00:44:15.760 align:start position:0%
work on this bill today we will schedule
 
00:44:17.829 --> 00:44:17.839 align:start position:0%
another work session next week on it as
 
00:44:19.750 --> 00:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
i had said to you in our phone
 
00:44:21.750 --> 00:44:21.760 align:start position:0%
conversation but i'd certainly like to
 
00:44:23.430 --> 00:44:23.440 align:start position:0%
look at your amendment and give you an
 
00:44:24.950 --> 00:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity to present your thoughts to
 
00:44:26.309 --> 00:44:26.319 align:start position:0%
the committee and have a little
 
00:44:28.390 --> 00:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
committee feedback good
 
00:44:31.270 --> 00:44:31.280 align:start position:0%
uh i have the copies from ols i haven't
 
00:44:33.829 --> 00:44:33.839 align:start position:0%
been through this process before
 
00:44:33.839 --> 00:44:35.190 align:start position:0%
been through this process before
and

00:44:35.190 --> 00:44:35.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:36.880 align:start position:0%
so i gather someone on the committee
 
00:44:38.870 --> 00:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
needs to amend
 
00:44:41.430 --> 00:44:41.440 align:start position:0%
accept this amendment well if it would
 
00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:42.640 align:start position:0%
have to be someone on the committee that
 
00:44:44.470 --> 00:44:44.480 align:start position:0%
would move it in when when we do execute
 
00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:46.240 align:start position:0%
the bill i wasn't sure that you were
 
00:44:47.349 --> 00:44:47.359 align:start position:0%
going to be in attendance from our
 
00:44:56.790 --> 00:44:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:56.800 --> 00:44:58.950 align:start position:0%
 
my

00:44:58.950 --> 00:44:58.960 align:start position:0%
my
 
00:44:58.960 --> 00:44:59.990 align:start position:0%
my
colleague

00:44:59.990 --> 00:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
colleague
 
00:45:02.710 --> 00:45:02.720 align:start position:0%
dr finkel who is the scientist who has
 
00:45:05.190 --> 00:45:05.200 align:start position:0%
worked on this and i had a
 
00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
really very
 
00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
substantial and cordial conversation
 
00:45:11.589 --> 00:45:11.599 align:start position:0%
with director wimsat
 
00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
from des
 
00:45:15.349 --> 00:45:15.359 align:start position:0%
and after that
 
00:45:17.670 --> 00:45:17.680 align:start position:0%
and after rereading his letter that he
 
00:45:20.710 --> 00:45:20.720 align:start position:0%
brought in testimony here
 
00:45:24.470 --> 00:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:27.990 --> 00:45:28.000 align:start position:0%
all of his concerns were answered
 
00:45:31.109 --> 00:45:31.119 align:start position:0%
by the amendments that we incorporated
 
00:45:34.309 --> 00:45:34.319 align:start position:0%
into the main bill section c
 
00:45:37.190 --> 00:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
which talked about the future
 
00:45:39.510 --> 00:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
is eliminated entirely
 
00:45:41.910 --> 00:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
and there are small changes made in the
 
00:45:43.750 --> 00:45:43.760 align:start position:0%
first two paragraphs
 
00:45:46.390 --> 00:45:46.400 align:start position:0%
making it clear that nobody needs to go
 
00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
on to anybody's private
 
00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:50.069 align:start position:0%
on to anybody's private
property

00:45:50.069 --> 00:45:50.079 align:start position:0%
property
 
00:45:52.870 --> 00:45:52.880 align:start position:0%
to do anything
 
00:45:55.109 --> 00:45:55.119 align:start position:0%
the the applicant is not put in that
 
00:45:58.630 --> 00:45:58.640 align:start position:0%
position so those are the major changes
 
00:46:01.670 --> 00:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
which respond to his concerns
 
00:46:04.790 --> 00:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
and we are very happy with the fact that
 
00:46:06.470 --> 00:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
we were able to do that
 
00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:07.270 align:start position:0%
we were able to do that
and

00:46:07.270 --> 00:46:07.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:46:10.230 --> 00:46:10.240 align:start position:0%
of course with the cooperation of
 
00:46:12.390 --> 00:46:12.400 align:start position:0%
the drafting attorney
 
00:46:15.190 --> 00:46:15.200 align:start position:0%
so that's why we are presenting it
 
00:46:18.309 --> 00:46:18.319 align:start position:0%
next week if you have a work session i
 
00:46:18.319 --> 00:46:19.109 align:start position:0%
next week if you have a work session i
think

00:46:19.109 --> 00:46:19.119 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:46:21.510 --> 00:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
we can have more information
 
00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:24.160 align:start position:0%
i would love to get feedback from you
 
00:46:26.390 --> 00:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
either by email or
 
00:46:29.109 --> 00:46:29.119 align:start position:0%
in person today
 
00:46:30.230 --> 00:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
as to
 
00:46:32.710 --> 00:46:32.720 align:start position:0%
other concerns that you might have
 
00:46:35.349 --> 00:46:35.359 align:start position:0%
about this bill but i think that this
 
00:46:37.349 --> 00:46:37.359 align:start position:0%
slimmer trimmer
 
00:46:39.829 --> 00:46:39.839 align:start position:0%
less complex bill is a very very good
 
00:46:42.069 --> 00:46:42.079 align:start position:0%
one and i'm happy we were able to make
 
00:46:43.990 --> 00:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
those changes
 
00:46:45.829 --> 00:46:45.839 align:start position:0%
well i'd like to thank you for uh
 
00:46:47.910 --> 00:46:47.920 align:start position:0%
listening to the testimony from and
 
00:46:49.270 --> 00:46:49.280 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee members and
 
00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:54.790 --> 00:46:54.800 align:start position:0%
i appreciate your effort on that
 
00:46:56.630 --> 00:46:56.640 align:start position:0%
so i know some of you may not have had
 
00:46:58.790 --> 00:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to really digest the
 
00:47:00.550 --> 00:47:00.560 align:start position:0%
content of the new amendment but we'll
 
00:47:02.550 --> 00:47:02.560 align:start position:0%
uh we'll go around today and get what
 
00:47:05.109 --> 00:47:05.119 align:start position:0%
questions and concerns that people have
 
00:47:07.030 --> 00:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
and perhaps we'll
 
00:47:08.790 --> 00:47:08.800 align:start position:0%
be able to do a more thorough job next
 
00:47:10.470 --> 00:47:10.480 align:start position:0%
week we have so many bills on the agenda
 
00:47:11.910 --> 00:47:11.920 align:start position:0%
this week i knew it would be different
 
00:47:14.230 --> 00:47:14.240 align:start position:0%
so do you have a do you have a day next
 
00:47:16.470 --> 00:47:16.480 align:start position:0%
week i do not i have to check with the
 
00:47:18.150 --> 00:47:18.160 align:start position:0%
committee assistant and make sure i'm
 
00:47:19.910 --> 00:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
pretty sure tuesday will work but i need
 
00:47:21.270 --> 00:47:21.280 align:start position:0%
to before i commit to that i just need
 
00:47:23.270 --> 00:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
to confirm that it's available
 
00:47:25.670 --> 00:47:25.680 align:start position:0%
but i will do that representative bixby
 
00:47:27.829 --> 00:47:27.839 align:start position:0%
yes um so i
 
00:47:29.990 --> 00:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
look through this amendment and on the
 
00:47:32.790 --> 00:47:32.800 align:start position:0%
whole i really like the way it works uh
 
00:47:35.109 --> 00:47:35.119 align:start position:0%
there are a couple of specific questions
 
00:47:36.950 --> 00:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
i have
 
00:47:40.470 --> 00:47:40.480 align:start position:0%
one is um and do you know if shallow and
 
00:47:42.630 --> 00:47:42.640 align:start position:0%
deep groundwater are terms that are
 
00:47:45.589 --> 00:47:45.599 align:start position:0%
defined elsewhere in statute
 
00:47:48.069 --> 00:47:48.079 align:start position:0%
i don't know that we'll find out
 
00:47:50.870 --> 00:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
so if they are not then i would say that
 
00:47:53.910 --> 00:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:57.589 --> 00:47:57.599 align:start position:0%
the other thing i is just a
 
00:47:57.599 --> 00:47:59.670 align:start position:0%
the other thing i is just a
um

00:47:59.670 --> 00:47:59.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:01.829 --> 00:48:01.839 align:start position:0%
just a sort of a clarity of writing
 
00:48:03.990 --> 00:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
thing on the last sentence it's a little
 
00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:04.950 align:start position:0%
thing on the last sentence it's a little
bit

00:48:04.950 --> 00:48:04.960 align:start position:0%
bit
 
00:48:06.790 --> 00:48:06.800 align:start position:0%
cumbersome and
 
00:48:09.910 --> 00:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
i could suggest i could uh
 
00:48:12.630 --> 00:48:12.640 align:start position:0%
uh uh or five times x
 
00:48:15.030 --> 00:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
would be a a more
 
00:48:16.950 --> 00:48:16.960 align:start position:0%
succinct way of saying that and i i can
 
00:48:18.390 --> 00:48:18.400 align:start position:0%
i can work on the language and send it
 
00:48:19.670 --> 00:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
to you as
 
00:48:22.870 --> 00:48:22.880 align:start position:0%
that seems very doable
 
00:48:24.549 --> 00:48:24.559 align:start position:0%
i think we've tried to have something
 
00:48:24.559 --> 00:48:25.750 align:start position:0%
i think we've tried to have something
that

00:48:25.750 --> 00:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:48:27.990 --> 00:48:28.000 align:start position:0%
the applicant can understand
 
00:48:29.829 --> 00:48:29.839 align:start position:0%
people on local
 
00:48:33.190 --> 00:48:33.200 align:start position:0%
conservation committees can understand
 
00:48:35.670 --> 00:48:35.680 align:start position:0%
and so i really appreciate
 
00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:36.870 align:start position:0%
and so i really appreciate
any

00:48:36.870 --> 00:48:36.880 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:48:38.470 --> 00:48:38.480 align:start position:0%
drive to clarity
 
00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
okay and one one other minor uh
 
00:48:44.230 --> 00:48:44.240 align:start position:0%
thing there is that uh
 
00:48:46.710 --> 00:48:46.720 align:start position:0%
the phrase as is currently the setback
 
00:48:48.470 --> 00:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
specified in rules
 
00:48:50.309 --> 00:48:50.319 align:start position:0%
uh doesn't actually
 
00:48:52.870 --> 00:48:52.880 align:start position:0%
work that phrase doesn't make sense in
 
00:48:55.030 --> 00:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
statute because you're if you're
 
00:48:57.349 --> 00:48:57.359 align:start position:0%
referring to current rules
 
00:48:57.359 --> 00:48:58.470 align:start position:0%
referring to current rules
stat

00:48:58.470 --> 00:48:58.480 align:start position:0%
stat
 
00:49:01.430 --> 00:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
statutes are sort of a higher level than
 
00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:02.470 align:start position:0%
statutes are sort of a higher level than
rules

00:49:02.470 --> 00:49:02.480 align:start position:0%
rules
 
00:49:04.549 --> 00:49:04.559 align:start position:0%
so you can't you can't really reference
 
00:49:06.470 --> 00:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
rules and statutes unless unless you're
 
00:49:09.349 --> 00:49:09.359 align:start position:0%
saying there's rule making authority
 
00:49:09.359 --> 00:49:10.069 align:start position:0%
saying there's rule making authority
good

00:49:10.069 --> 00:49:10.079 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:49:15.270 --> 00:49:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:17.990 --> 00:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
representative kampla
 
00:49:19.510 --> 00:49:19.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:21.910 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
um

00:49:21.910 --> 00:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:23.910 --> 00:49:23.920 align:start position:0%
so in reading this bill i noticed that
 
00:49:27.349 --> 00:49:27.359 align:start position:0%
then on line six it says
 
00:49:29.589 --> 00:49:29.599 align:start position:0%
landfill disposal area is proposed to be
 
00:49:32.630 --> 00:49:32.640 align:start position:0%
located sufficiently close
 
00:49:34.950 --> 00:49:34.960 align:start position:0%
i think that's very ambiguous
 
00:49:37.190 --> 00:49:37.200 align:start position:0%
and sufficiently close could mean a lot
 
00:49:38.470 --> 00:49:38.480 align:start position:0%
of things to different
 
00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:39.670 align:start position:0%
of things to different
people

00:49:39.670 --> 00:49:39.680 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:49:42.150 --> 00:49:42.160 align:start position:0%
i think that needs to be defined a
 
00:49:44.390 --> 00:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
little bit i'm not sure
 
00:49:47.510 --> 00:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
exactly what that means as far as uh
 
00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:52.710 align:start position:0%
exactly what that means as far as uh
location

00:49:52.710 --> 00:49:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:53.430 align:start position:0%
 
well

00:49:53.430 --> 00:49:53.440 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:49:54.710 --> 00:49:54.720 align:start position:0%
i i
 
00:49:56.549 --> 00:49:56.559 align:start position:0%
will certainly take a look at it but you
 
00:49:58.710 --> 00:49:58.720 align:start position:0%
have to take it in
 
00:50:00.150 --> 00:50:00.160 align:start position:0%
along with
 
00:50:01.910 --> 00:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
would be able to reach the water body
 
00:50:04.390 --> 00:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
within five years
 
00:50:07.030 --> 00:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
and maybe we can make it a little
 
00:50:09.430 --> 00:50:09.440 align:start position:0%
closer uh
 
00:50:14.069 --> 00:50:14.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:16.230 --> 00:50:16.240 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
00:50:17.829 --> 00:50:17.839 align:start position:0%
representative murray
 
00:50:19.430 --> 00:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair for taking my
 
00:50:21.750 --> 00:50:21.760 align:start position:0%
question i so just to be clear we're
 
00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
talking about the amendment rep contract
 
00:50:26.470 --> 00:50:26.480 align:start position:0%
is that correct on line six
 
00:50:29.109 --> 00:50:29.119 align:start position:0%
okay sorry thank you
 
00:50:29.119 --> 00:50:30.790 align:start position:0%
okay sorry thank you
yes

00:50:30.790 --> 00:50:30.800 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:50:31.990 --> 00:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:33.190 align:start position:0%
okay so
um

00:50:33.190 --> 00:50:33.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:37.589 --> 00:50:37.599 align:start position:0%
representative yeah so i think that uh
 
00:50:41.030 --> 00:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
red in you know if you read it
 
00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:42.390 align:start position:0%
red in you know if you read it
grammatically

00:50:42.390 --> 00:50:42.400 align:start position:0%
grammatically
 
00:50:44.630 --> 00:50:44.640 align:start position:0%
uh sort of looking at the whole context
 
00:50:46.790 --> 00:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
that's sufficiently close
 
00:50:48.950 --> 00:50:48.960 align:start position:0%
can be
 
00:50:52.069 --> 00:50:52.079 align:start position:0%
kind of makes sense but the fact that
 
00:50:53.190 --> 00:50:53.200 align:start position:0%
uh in
 
00:50:55.510 --> 00:50:55.520 align:start position:0%
in reading it it raises questions i
 
00:50:57.510 --> 00:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
think there's probably a way to rephrase
 
00:50:59.670 --> 00:50:59.680 align:start position:0%
that that will make it clearer
 
00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:08.470 --> 00:51:08.480 align:start position:0%
i have a question mr chair
 
00:51:10.390 --> 00:51:10.400 align:start position:0%
i'll get you back
 
00:51:11.270 --> 00:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for bringing this amendment um
 
00:51:18.069 --> 00:51:18.079 align:start position:0%
so given some of the questions regarding
 
00:51:19.990 --> 00:51:20.000 align:start position:0%
needing definitions
 
00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
did you in your conversations with the
 
00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:24.710 align:start position:0%
did you in your conversations with the
es

00:51:24.710 --> 00:51:24.720 align:start position:0%
es
 
00:51:26.870 --> 00:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
discuss any of that
 
00:51:29.750 --> 00:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
as needing being defined
 
00:51:32.069 --> 00:51:32.079 align:start position:0%
was that no that they didn't yeah
 
00:51:34.549 --> 00:51:34.559 align:start position:0%
we spent i'd say close to an hour
 
00:51:37.670 --> 00:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
talking with the director on a three-way
 
00:51:40.309 --> 00:51:40.319 align:start position:0%
phone conversation i'd never used that
 
00:51:42.150 --> 00:51:42.160 align:start position:0%
format before and
 
00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:42.950 align:start position:0%
format before and
i've

00:51:42.950 --> 00:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
i've
 
00:51:44.630 --> 00:51:44.640 align:start position:0%
moved away from thinking zoom is the
 
00:51:46.390 --> 00:51:46.400 align:start position:0%
best and thinking three-way phone is
 
00:51:48.790 --> 00:51:48.800 align:start position:0%
pretty good too
 
00:51:50.870 --> 00:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
but he did not mention any need for
 
00:51:52.870 --> 00:51:52.880 align:start position:0%
definitions but
 
00:51:55.990 --> 00:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
since the purpose of such a law is to
 
00:51:56.950 --> 00:51:56.960 align:start position:0%
make it
 
00:51:58.710 --> 00:51:58.720 align:start position:0%
understandable to a large number of
 
00:51:58.720 --> 00:51:59.829 align:start position:0%
understandable to a large number of
people

00:51:59.829 --> 00:51:59.839 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:52:02.309 --> 00:52:02.319 align:start position:0%
if if that's what people think is needed
 
00:52:03.990 --> 00:52:04.000 align:start position:0%
we'll certainly see if there is one that
 
00:52:09.430 --> 00:52:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:12.630 --> 00:52:12.640 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead is it your intent then in
 
00:52:14.309 --> 00:52:14.319 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:52:16.630 --> 00:52:16.640 align:start position:0%
effort to clarify some of those
 
00:52:19.270 --> 00:52:19.280 align:start position:0%
definitions to go back to des and talk
 
00:52:21.750 --> 00:52:21.760 align:start position:0%
to them about their thoughts on that i
 
00:52:24.710 --> 00:52:24.720 align:start position:0%
certainly will i i saw that
 
00:52:29.190 --> 00:52:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:30.150 align:start position:0%
 
but

00:52:30.150 --> 00:52:30.160 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
i don't see him okay thank you
 
00:52:33.589 --> 00:52:33.599 align:start position:0%
he's actually right behind you if you
 
00:52:36.069 --> 00:52:36.079 align:start position:0%
look over your right shoulder
 
00:52:39.750 --> 00:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
you are here
 
00:52:42.470 --> 00:52:42.480 align:start position:0%
but with a mask
 
00:52:45.510 --> 00:52:45.520 align:start position:0%
uh representative compta
 
00:52:48.309 --> 00:52:48.319 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair um just i'm
 
00:52:49.910 --> 00:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
reading this again
 
00:52:52.549 --> 00:52:52.559 align:start position:0%
um and i'm not a geologist so
 
00:52:54.630 --> 00:52:54.640 align:start position:0%
bear with me because i don't understand
 
00:52:57.589 --> 00:52:57.599 align:start position:0%
everything but um
 
00:53:00.150 --> 00:53:00.160 align:start position:0%
i believe that our groundwater in our
 
00:53:02.309 --> 00:53:02.319 align:start position:0%
streams underneath the earth change over
 
00:53:02.319 --> 00:53:03.430 align:start position:0%
streams underneath the earth change over
time

00:53:03.430 --> 00:53:03.440 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:53:07.910 --> 00:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
and so from a geological standpoint
 
00:53:10.309 --> 00:53:10.319 align:start position:0%
due to geological changes underground
 
00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
water can take to start taking a
 
00:53:13.990 --> 00:53:14.000 align:start position:0%
different path how will we address that
 
00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:16.150 align:start position:0%
different path how will we address that
issue

00:53:16.150 --> 00:53:16.160 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:53:18.630 --> 00:53:18.640 align:start position:0%
i think just the way the law does now if
 
00:53:21.030 --> 00:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
that happens it happens but
 
00:53:22.950 --> 00:53:22.960 align:start position:0%
it's rare
 
00:53:24.390 --> 00:53:24.400 align:start position:0%
go ahead follow it
 
00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:27.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair so based on this if
 
00:53:30.790 --> 00:53:30.800 align:start position:0%
right now the path is for
 
00:53:32.230 --> 00:53:32.240 align:start position:0%
you're going to base something on five
 
00:53:33.589 --> 00:53:33.599 align:start position:0%
years out but all of a sudden there's a
 
00:53:37.510 --> 00:53:37.520 align:start position:0%
geological change and the path
 
00:53:39.430 --> 00:53:39.440 align:start position:0%
reverses course and then goes somewhere
 
00:53:41.510 --> 00:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
where it wasn't intended to go
 
00:53:47.030 --> 00:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:52.790 --> 00:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:58.069 --> 00:53:58.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:59.829 --> 00:53:59.839 align:start position:0%
maybe there needs to be a phrase that
 
00:54:01.750 --> 00:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
says just how that would
 
00:54:03.990 --> 00:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
how that would work
 
00:54:05.910 --> 00:54:05.920 align:start position:0%
all right any further thoughts or
 
00:54:07.750 --> 00:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
comments for rep tucker uh
 
00:54:10.069 --> 00:54:10.079 align:start position:0%
representative bixby yeah i think in in
 
00:54:11.990 --> 00:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
terms of you know if there is a change
 
00:54:14.230 --> 00:54:14.240 align:start position:0%
of the course of a river or something it
 
00:54:16.630 --> 00:54:16.640 align:start position:0%
pretty much that's that's not something
 
00:54:18.390 --> 00:54:18.400 align:start position:0%
that we have
 
00:54:19.990 --> 00:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
control over
 
00:54:22.549 --> 00:54:22.559 align:start position:0%
and if that happens after the permit is
 
00:54:24.549 --> 00:54:24.559 align:start position:0%
granted then i think the permit is
 
00:54:24.559 --> 00:54:25.589 align:start position:0%
granted then i think the permit is
granted

00:54:25.589 --> 00:54:25.599 align:start position:0%
granted
 
00:54:27.990 --> 00:54:28.000 align:start position:0%
uh and if it happens
 
00:54:29.990 --> 00:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
before the permitting process before the
 
00:54:31.910 --> 00:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
granting of the permit then that would
 
00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:33.280 align:start position:0%
need to be taken in account into the
 
00:54:35.589 --> 00:54:35.599 align:start position:0%
primating process because this law is
 
00:54:35.599 --> 00:54:36.390 align:start position:0%
primating process because this law is
based

00:54:36.390 --> 00:54:36.400 align:start position:0%
based
 
00:54:37.750 --> 00:54:37.760 align:start position:0%
this piece of statute that you're
 
00:54:39.109 --> 00:54:39.119 align:start position:0%
proposing is
 
00:54:39.119 --> 00:54:40.470 align:start position:0%
proposing is
specifically

00:54:40.470 --> 00:54:40.480 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
00:54:43.109 --> 00:54:43.119 align:start position:0%
establishing the setback necessary for a
 
00:54:47.670 --> 00:54:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:50.069 --> 00:54:50.079 align:start position:0%
okay director rimsett would you have any
 
00:54:52.390 --> 00:54:52.400 align:start position:0%
interest in having a few words on this
 
00:54:53.589 --> 00:54:53.599 align:start position:0%
or is there nothing further you'd like
 
00:54:56.549 --> 00:54:56.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:56.559 --> 00:54:57.510 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:54:57.510 --> 00:54:57.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:54:59.670 --> 00:54:59.680 align:start position:0%
thank you rep tucker i think we'll uh
 
00:55:01.910 --> 00:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
in the interest of time i'm going to uh
 
00:55:03.990 --> 00:55:04.000 align:start position:0%
we're going to have a full
 
00:55:05.670 --> 00:55:05.680 align:start position:0%
worked uh
 
00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:06.470 align:start position:0%
worked uh
yeah

00:55:06.470 --> 00:55:06.480 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:55:08.789 --> 00:55:08.799 align:start position:0%
work session on this next tuesday i did
 
00:55:11.030 --> 00:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
confirm the date is available
 
00:55:13.910 --> 00:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
um we'll convene at 10 a.m we may have
 
00:55:15.750 --> 00:55:15.760 align:start position:0%
more than one bill to do in fact i think
 
00:55:17.910 --> 00:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
we'll have two but we
 
00:55:19.670 --> 00:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
will plan on convening the committee at
 
00:55:22.470 --> 00:55:22.480 align:start position:0%
10 a.m on the on the 8th of february and
 
00:55:24.470 --> 00:55:24.480 align:start position:0%
we'll work on this bill as potentially
 
00:55:25.990 --> 00:55:26.000 align:start position:0%
another one so director rim said if
 
00:55:27.750 --> 00:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
you'd like to come up and we'll have a
 
00:55:29.589 --> 00:55:29.599 align:start position:0%
little discussion
 
00:55:30.870 --> 00:55:30.880 align:start position:0%
see if the committee has any questions
 
00:55:32.470 --> 00:55:32.480 align:start position:0%
for you representative bolden did you
 
00:55:35.270 --> 00:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
have a question for the director yes
 
00:55:37.990 --> 00:55:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:39.190 --> 00:55:39.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
00:55:41.270 --> 00:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
director wimsat for taking my question
 
00:55:44.230 --> 00:55:44.240 align:start position:0%
um we just talked about uh groundwater
 
00:55:45.670 --> 00:55:45.680 align:start position:0%
kind of changing is that something that
 
00:55:47.430 --> 00:55:47.440 align:start position:0%
usually happens relatively quickly or
 
00:55:48.950 --> 00:55:48.960 align:start position:0%
does that happen over hundreds or
 
00:55:50.950 --> 00:55:50.960 align:start position:0%
thousands of years
 
00:55:53.349 --> 00:55:53.359 align:start position:0%
uh i think in the context of what we're
 
00:55:55.750 --> 00:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
talking about um you know i think we
 
00:55:57.109 --> 00:55:57.119 align:start position:0%
talked a little bit about this during
 
00:55:58.710 --> 00:55:58.720 align:start position:0%
the hearing i think i fielded a question
 
00:56:00.870 --> 00:56:00.880 align:start position:0%
on it uh really that the kind of thing
 
00:56:02.549 --> 00:56:02.559 align:start position:0%
that would the kind of changes that
 
00:56:05.109 --> 00:56:05.119 align:start position:0%
would impact this kind of analysis
 
00:56:06.470 --> 00:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
are things i think i mentioned like a
 
00:56:08.710 --> 00:56:08.720 align:start position:0%
river evulsion which is very rare in
 
00:56:09.990 --> 00:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
here i mean at least
 
00:56:11.910 --> 00:56:11.920 align:start position:0%
rivers move over time but they tend to
 
00:56:14.630 --> 00:56:14.640 align:start position:0%
do so rather slowly and when they do so
 
00:56:16.549 --> 00:56:16.559 align:start position:0%
very rapidly and violently it's called
 
00:56:18.150 --> 00:56:18.160 align:start position:0%
an avulsion
 
00:56:19.670 --> 00:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
i'm not an expert on this i'm aware of
 
00:56:21.030 --> 00:56:21.040 align:start position:0%
one of those things happening in new
 
00:56:23.270 --> 00:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire within the last 20 years and
 
00:56:25.910 --> 00:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
that was the suncook river but it's yes
 
00:56:27.750 --> 00:56:27.760 align:start position:0%
so i would say it's relatively rare to
 
00:56:29.750 --> 00:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
have that kind of a change okay thank
 
00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:32.470 align:start position:0%
have that kind of a change okay thank
you

00:56:32.470 --> 00:56:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:36.390 --> 00:56:36.400 align:start position:0%
representative bixby yes um so i had a
 
00:56:38.789 --> 00:56:38.799 align:start position:0%
concern about the definition of uh
 
00:56:40.549 --> 00:56:40.559 align:start position:0%
shallow and deep groundwater and i was
 
00:56:42.630 --> 00:56:42.640 align:start position:0%
wondering if those definitions exist in
 
00:56:45.510 --> 00:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
statute or if that's something that
 
00:56:46.630 --> 00:56:46.640 align:start position:0%
you could
 
00:56:48.789 --> 00:56:48.799 align:start position:0%
help in the drafting of an amendment to
 
00:56:51.109 --> 00:56:51.119 align:start position:0%
get definitions for those
 
00:56:53.829 --> 00:56:53.839 align:start position:0%
i'm not aware that they exist in statute
 
00:56:56.789 --> 00:56:56.799 align:start position:0%
certainly not in 149m
 
00:56:58.470 --> 00:56:58.480 align:start position:0%
and it's almost always helpful to have
 
00:57:00.470 --> 00:57:00.480 align:start position:0%
clear definitions in a statute so that's
 
00:57:02.309 --> 00:57:02.319 align:start position:0%
something that could be evaluated i
 
00:57:02.319 --> 00:57:03.270 align:start position:0%
something that could be evaluated i
think

00:57:03.270 --> 00:57:03.280 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:57:05.430 --> 00:57:05.440 align:start position:0%
in the context of what this bill is
 
00:57:07.349 --> 00:57:07.359 align:start position:0%
seeking to accomplish
 
00:57:09.670 --> 00:57:09.680 align:start position:0%
um there may be maybe another way to go
 
00:57:11.589 --> 00:57:11.599 align:start position:0%
at it just to say you know
 
00:57:13.990 --> 00:57:14.000 align:start position:0%
to evaluate it
 
00:57:16.069 --> 00:57:16.079 align:start position:0%
you know in the in the groundwater
 
00:57:18.230 --> 00:57:18.240 align:start position:0%
environment both deep and shallow if you
 
00:57:20.150 --> 00:57:20.160 align:start position:0%
start trying to
 
00:57:21.750 --> 00:57:21.760 align:start position:0%
if you start trying to really carefully
 
00:57:23.910 --> 00:57:23.920 align:start position:0%
define it you almost maybe box out what
 
00:57:26.150 --> 00:57:26.160 align:start position:0%
you're trying to do i think the way i
 
00:57:27.430 --> 00:57:27.440 align:start position:0%
would read this if this bill were to
 
00:57:29.829 --> 00:57:29.839 align:start position:0%
pass that the agency would be directed
 
00:57:32.549 --> 00:57:32.559 align:start position:0%
to um you know that the consultant that
 
00:57:34.470 --> 00:57:34.480 align:start position:0%
would be hired by the applicant would
 
00:57:36.630 --> 00:57:36.640 align:start position:0%
need to look at the whole
 
00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:37.510 align:start position:0%
need to look at the whole
um

00:57:37.510 --> 00:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:39.430 --> 00:57:39.440 align:start position:0%
plausible groundwater flow regime
 
00:57:41.589 --> 00:57:41.599 align:start position:0%
beneath the landfill and determine where
 
00:57:44.470 --> 00:57:44.480 align:start position:0%
the maximum seepage velocity might occur
 
00:57:46.549 --> 00:57:46.559 align:start position:0%
okay follow up
 
00:57:48.950 --> 00:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
yeah so if you could uh help us with
 
00:57:51.109 --> 00:57:51.119 align:start position:0%
some language to make that a little bit
 
00:57:52.789 --> 00:57:52.799 align:start position:0%
clearer so that
 
00:57:54.390 --> 00:57:54.400 align:start position:0%
uh so that
 
00:57:55.910 --> 00:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
someone who was
 
00:57:58.549 --> 00:57:58.559 align:start position:0%
doing the hydrology for a permit would
 
00:57:59.670 --> 00:57:59.680 align:start position:0%
you have a
 
00:58:02.069 --> 00:58:02.079 align:start position:0%
pretty um clear
 
00:58:04.870 --> 00:58:04.880 align:start position:0%
clearly laid out uh assignment for how
 
00:58:06.789 --> 00:58:06.799 align:start position:0%
that's assessed sure it's not
 
00:58:07.910 --> 00:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
immediately clear to me how to
 
00:58:09.270 --> 00:58:09.280 align:start position:0%
accomplish that but i'm happy to work
 
00:58:12.870 --> 00:58:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:17.670 --> 00:58:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:19.190 --> 00:58:19.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:58:22.630 --> 00:58:22.640 align:start position:0%
uh director wins said on i'm on my
 
00:58:24.710 --> 00:58:24.720 align:start position:0%
conservation commission
 
00:58:26.069 --> 00:58:26.079 align:start position:0%
and i
 
00:58:29.430 --> 00:58:29.440 align:start position:0%
uh about 10 years ago went to a
 
00:58:31.349 --> 00:58:31.359 align:start position:0%
national new hampshire association of
 
00:58:33.430 --> 00:58:33.440 align:start position:0%
conservation commission's
 
00:58:33.440 --> 00:58:34.630 align:start position:0%
conservation commission's
uh

00:58:34.630 --> 00:58:34.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:58:38.069 --> 00:58:38.079 align:start position:0%
annual meeting and there was the
 
00:58:38.079 --> 00:58:39.270 align:start position:0%
annual meeting and there was the
hydro

00:58:39.270 --> 00:58:39.280 align:start position:0%
hydro
 
00:58:42.789 --> 00:58:42.799 align:start position:0%
the fluvio geologist of the state
 
00:58:47.190 --> 00:58:47.200 align:start position:0%
was presenting a really vivid number of
 
00:58:49.670 --> 00:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
slides showing how far
 
00:58:51.910 --> 00:58:51.920 align:start position:0%
rivers have moved
 
00:58:55.270 --> 00:58:55.280 align:start position:0%
over the last 70 years
 
00:58:57.510 --> 00:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire particularly the ones
 
00:58:59.349 --> 00:58:59.359 align:start position:0%
in the north country were the ones that
 
00:59:00.789 --> 00:59:00.799 align:start position:0%
they were showing
 
00:59:00.799 --> 00:59:02.549 align:start position:0%
they were showing
and

00:59:02.549 --> 00:59:02.559 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:59:04.549 --> 00:59:04.559 align:start position:0%
i wonder do do
 
00:59:06.630 --> 00:59:06.640 align:start position:0%
when you're dealing with the landfill
 
00:59:09.270 --> 00:59:09.280 align:start position:0%
issues now do you consult with the hydro
 
00:59:11.349 --> 00:59:11.359 align:start position:0%
with fluvial i think he's a fluvial
 
00:59:13.750 --> 00:59:13.760 align:start position:0%
hydro geologist
 
00:59:15.750 --> 00:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
uh yeah i think you're referring to dr
 
00:59:18.069 --> 00:59:18.079 align:start position:0%
sheen chicky who
 
00:59:20.150 --> 00:59:20.160 align:start position:0%
actually he has since become the new
 
00:59:22.710 --> 00:59:22.720 align:start position:0%
hampshire state geologist
 
00:59:22.720 --> 00:59:25.190 align:start position:0%
hampshire state geologist
but

00:59:25.190 --> 00:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:28.150 --> 00:59:28.160 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that we've had direct
 
00:59:29.990 --> 00:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
consults with them on
 
00:59:31.670 --> 00:59:31.680 align:start position:0%
applications that we've reviewed before
 
00:59:32.870 --> 00:59:32.880 align:start position:0%
but that's certainly something to be
 
00:59:35.190 --> 00:59:35.200 align:start position:0%
available to us
 
00:59:38.069 --> 00:59:38.079 align:start position:0%
thank you i i don't know if that ought
 
00:59:39.990 --> 00:59:40.000 align:start position:0%
to be involved in
 
00:59:41.589 --> 00:59:41.599 align:start position:0%
in the bill i haven't had a chance to
 
00:59:43.829 --> 00:59:43.839 align:start position:0%
look at the bill i'm just subbing thank
 
00:59:43.839 --> 00:59:44.870 align:start position:0%
look at the bill i'm just subbing thank
you

00:59:44.870 --> 00:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:59:47.430 --> 00:59:47.440 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions for the
 
00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:50.309 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions for the
director

00:59:50.309 --> 00:59:50.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:51.589 --> 00:59:51.599 align:start position:0%
all right thank you sir we appreciate
 
00:59:56.069 --> 00:59:56.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:57.910 --> 00:59:57.920 align:start position:0%
any uh any more discussion from the
 
00:59:59.430 --> 00:59:59.440 align:start position:0%
committee before we move along we are
 
01:00:01.510 --> 01:00:01.520 align:start position:0%
going to have a much more thorough work
 
01:00:03.510 --> 01:00:03.520 align:start position:0%
session on this next week and i think
 
01:00:05.670 --> 01:00:05.680 align:start position:0%
we've given um
 
01:00:08.710 --> 01:00:08.720 align:start position:0%
representative tucker some at least some
 
01:00:10.789 --> 01:00:10.799 align:start position:0%
good good start yes i'll come ahead
 
01:00:10.799 --> 01:00:14.230 align:start position:0%
good good start yes i'll come ahead
please

01:00:14.230 --> 01:00:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:15.829 --> 01:00:15.839 align:start position:0%
so i will
 
01:00:18.789 --> 01:00:18.799 align:start position:0%
send out to all the committee my
 
01:00:21.910 --> 01:00:21.920 align:start position:0%
email that i use on a regular basis so
 
01:00:24.309 --> 01:00:24.319 align:start position:0%
that if you do have questions that arise
 
01:00:26.390 --> 01:00:26.400 align:start position:0%
as you look at this again
 
01:00:27.990 --> 01:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
please send them on to me i'd like to
 
01:00:30.630 --> 01:00:30.640 align:start position:0%
come fully prepared next tuesday thank
 
01:00:33.589 --> 01:00:33.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:35.430 --> 01:00:35.440 align:start position:0%
well thank you for your willingness to
 
01:00:38.470 --> 01:00:38.480 align:start position:0%
consider the committee's concerns
 
01:00:41.589 --> 01:00:41.599 align:start position:0%
anything else before we move along
 
01:00:41.599 --> 01:00:43.109 align:start position:0%
anything else before we move along
okay

01:00:43.109 --> 01:00:43.119 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:00:45.510 --> 01:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
our last bill on the work session agenda
 
01:00:47.990 --> 01:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
is uh establishing the capital
 
01:00:49.349 --> 01:00:49.359 align:start position:0%
improvement grant program for the
 
01:00:51.190 --> 01:00:51.200 align:start position:0%
benefit of state fairs and agricultural
 
01:00:56.230 --> 01:00:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:58.069 --> 01:00:58.079 align:start position:0%
so i understand from uh that
 
01:01:00.069 --> 01:01:00.079 align:start position:0%
representative bixby had some concerns
 
01:01:01.670 --> 01:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
and i guess i will
 
01:01:03.349 --> 01:01:03.359 align:start position:0%
open the floor up and let him express
 
01:01:04.710 --> 01:01:04.720 align:start position:0%
those and that's we'll kind of start
 
01:01:05.670 --> 01:01:05.680 align:start position:0%
from there
 
01:01:06.870 --> 01:01:06.880 align:start position:0%
right so
 
01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:07.910 align:start position:0%
right so
um

01:01:07.910 --> 01:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:10.470 --> 01:01:10.480 align:start position:0%
one of the things that
 
01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:11.829 align:start position:0%
one of the things that
that

01:01:11.829 --> 01:01:11.839 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:01:14.069 --> 01:01:14.079 align:start position:0%
comes up so when when i look at a bill
 
01:01:15.190 --> 01:01:15.200 align:start position:0%
that is
 
01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:16.230 align:start position:0%
that is
uh

01:01:16.230 --> 01:01:16.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:01:18.309 --> 01:01:18.319 align:start position:0%
saying we're going to be
 
01:01:21.109 --> 01:01:21.119 align:start position:0%
uh creating a fund that annually is
 
01:01:24.390 --> 01:01:24.400 align:start position:0%
drawing 250 thousand dollars from the
 
01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:25.349 align:start position:0%
drawing 250 thousand dollars from the
uh

01:01:25.349 --> 01:01:25.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:01:27.589 --> 01:01:27.599 align:start position:0%
from the general fund one of my
 
01:01:30.470 --> 01:01:30.480 align:start position:0%
questions is where might that money be
 
01:01:34.150 --> 01:01:34.160 align:start position:0%
otherwise used so is this a policy that
 
01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:35.030 align:start position:0%
otherwise used so is this a policy that
is

01:01:35.030 --> 01:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:01:36.870 --> 01:01:36.880 align:start position:0%
of a greater
 
01:01:41.030 --> 01:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh good than other policies that um may
 
01:01:43.910 --> 01:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
be competing for that 250 000
 
01:01:46.470 --> 01:01:46.480 align:start position:0%
a couple of um
 
01:01:49.349 --> 01:01:49.359 align:start position:0%
specific examples come up that i can
 
01:01:51.430 --> 01:01:51.440 align:start position:0%
think of are
 
01:01:54.069 --> 01:01:54.079 align:start position:0%
um we had a we actually have a retained
 
01:01:56.789 --> 01:01:56.799 align:start position:0%
bill that is looking at creating
 
01:01:56.799 --> 01:01:58.549 align:start position:0%
bill that is looking at creating
a

01:01:58.549 --> 01:01:58.559 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:02:00.309 --> 01:02:00.319 align:start position:0%
uh actually it's a
 
01:02:01.990 --> 01:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
interim study bill looking that's
 
01:02:03.190 --> 01:02:03.200 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
01:02:05.349 --> 01:02:05.359 align:start position:0%
uh creating a
 
01:02:07.029 --> 01:02:07.039 align:start position:0%
grant of
 
01:02:07.039 --> 01:02:08.230 align:start position:0%
grant of
um

01:02:08.230 --> 01:02:08.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:10.710 --> 01:02:10.720 align:start position:0%
as written it was a grant
 
01:02:12.950 --> 01:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
the idea is perhaps to make it into a
 
01:02:15.750 --> 01:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
revolving loan fund that would provide
 
01:02:17.589 --> 01:02:17.599 align:start position:0%
matching funds for
 
01:02:20.870 --> 01:02:20.880 align:start position:0%
farmers who are trying to get federal
 
01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:22.150 align:start position:0%
farmers who are trying to get federal
uh

01:02:22.150 --> 01:02:22.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:02:25.589 --> 01:02:25.599 align:start position:0%
value-added produce grants uh and
 
01:02:25.599 --> 01:02:26.630 align:start position:0%
value-added produce grants uh and
uh

01:02:26.630 --> 01:02:26.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:02:29.029 --> 01:02:29.039 align:start position:0%
or production grants and
 
01:02:31.510 --> 01:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering okay so in order to fund
 
01:02:32.710 --> 01:02:32.720 align:start position:0%
that fully
 
01:02:34.390 --> 01:02:34.400 align:start position:0%
it was initially funded
 
01:02:36.069 --> 01:02:36.079 align:start position:0%
the suggestion was 100 000 and it was
 
01:02:37.829 --> 01:02:37.839 align:start position:0%
decided it was
 
01:02:40.470 --> 01:02:40.480 align:start position:0%
someone who testified indicated that was
 
01:02:42.230 --> 01:02:42.240 align:start position:0%
probably insufficient
 
01:02:43.990 --> 01:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
so i'm wondering okay so
 
01:02:48.230 --> 01:02:48.240 align:start position:0%
would 250 000 dollars be better used for
 
01:02:50.549 --> 01:02:50.559 align:start position:0%
something that helps our
 
01:02:50.559 --> 01:02:51.510 align:start position:0%
something that helps our
uh

01:02:51.510 --> 01:02:51.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:02:52.950 --> 01:02:52.960 align:start position:0%
farmers get
 
01:02:55.430 --> 01:02:55.440 align:start position:0%
uh loans from the more loans from the
 
01:02:57.109 --> 01:02:57.119 align:start position:0%
federal government so that they can
 
01:03:00.390 --> 01:03:00.400 align:start position:0%
produce do more value-added production
 
01:03:02.549 --> 01:03:02.559 align:start position:0%
or is it better for affairs
 
01:03:06.710 --> 01:03:06.720 align:start position:0%
uh another uh issue that came up uh
 
01:03:09.910 --> 01:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
was a bill that initially that i think
 
01:03:12.230 --> 01:03:12.240 align:start position:0%
originated in a study committee that
 
01:03:14.230 --> 01:03:14.240 align:start position:0%
started in this committee
 
01:03:18.069 --> 01:03:18.079 align:start position:0%
was um whether there should be
 
01:03:20.309 --> 01:03:20.319 align:start position:0%
regulation on cbd
 
01:03:23.910 --> 01:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
so that uh we so that it's clear that if
 
01:03:25.670 --> 01:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
you're buying cbd somewhere in new
 
01:03:27.510 --> 01:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire what you're getting is what is
 
01:03:29.990 --> 01:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
labeled on the bottle which is still not
 
01:03:31.670 --> 01:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
the case
 
01:03:33.029 --> 01:03:33.039 align:start position:0%
and that
 
01:03:35.910 --> 01:03:35.920 align:start position:0%
stalled in the senate uh because coming
 
01:03:38.150 --> 01:03:38.160 align:start position:0%
up with 340 000
 
01:03:41.109 --> 01:03:41.119 align:start position:0%
on a one-time basis was
 
01:03:41.119 --> 01:03:41.990 align:start position:0%
on a one-time basis was
uh

01:03:41.990 --> 01:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:03:44.309 --> 01:03:44.319 align:start position:0%
what was considered perhaps too much
 
01:03:45.829 --> 01:03:45.839 align:start position:0%
even though it would have eventually
 
01:03:48.309 --> 01:03:48.319 align:start position:0%
been entirely funded through fee income
 
01:03:50.390 --> 01:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
so i'm thinking okay so
 
01:03:52.630 --> 01:03:52.640 align:start position:0%
we're saying 250 000
 
01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:53.829 align:start position:0%
we're saying 250 000
for

01:03:53.829 --> 01:03:53.839 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:03:58.150 --> 01:03:58.160 align:start position:0%
uh doing capital projects at fares
 
01:03:59.990 --> 01:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
versus these other things which may in
 
01:04:01.349 --> 01:04:01.359 align:start position:0%
fact be
 
01:04:03.510 --> 01:04:03.520 align:start position:0%
more important for the welfare of our
 
01:04:05.029 --> 01:04:05.039 align:start position:0%
state so
 
01:04:08.950 --> 01:04:08.960 align:start position:0%
i i'm really hesitant to say yes this is
 
01:04:11.349 --> 01:04:11.359 align:start position:0%
uh this is just
 
01:04:13.430 --> 01:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
we can pass this just as a policy matter
 
01:04:15.589 --> 01:04:15.599 align:start position:0%
because we kind of like fairs
 
01:04:15.599 --> 01:04:16.549 align:start position:0%
because we kind of like fairs
while

01:04:16.549 --> 01:04:16.559 align:start position:0%
while
 
01:04:18.630 --> 01:04:18.640 align:start position:0%
we're also making a policy judgment that
 
01:04:20.710 --> 01:04:20.720 align:start position:0%
fares are better than some other things
 
01:04:21.670 --> 01:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
that are
 
01:04:25.589 --> 01:04:25.599 align:start position:0%
not uh as you know that maybe
 
01:04:27.829 --> 01:04:27.839 align:start position:0%
should be considered higher uh priority
 
01:04:29.029 --> 01:04:29.039 align:start position:0%
than the fares
 
01:04:31.510 --> 01:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
so that's that's my concern
 
01:04:33.750 --> 01:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative so i i think
 
01:04:36.309 --> 01:04:36.319 align:start position:0%
the the bill you were referring to was
 
01:04:36.319 --> 01:04:38.069 align:start position:0%
the the bill you were referring to was
um

01:04:38.069 --> 01:04:38.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:42.230 --> 01:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:45.190 --> 01:04:45.200 align:start position:0%
house bill 627 that was that's the one
 
01:04:47.990 --> 01:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
we still have an interim study
 
01:04:51.670 --> 01:04:51.680 align:start position:0%
so i i guess i would just quickly
 
01:04:53.990 --> 01:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
respond by saying that the committee
 
01:04:55.750 --> 01:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
hasn't decided that that's not a good
 
01:04:57.829 --> 01:04:57.839 align:start position:0%
policy we just wanted the opportunity to
 
01:04:59.589 --> 01:04:59.599 align:start position:0%
look at it a bit further
 
01:05:01.829 --> 01:05:01.839 align:start position:0%
and we don't have the opportunity with
 
01:05:03.670 --> 01:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
the second year bill to have interim
 
01:05:05.990 --> 01:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
study in the same manner
 
01:05:07.270 --> 01:05:07.280 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:05:09.029 --> 01:05:09.039 align:start position:0%
we can look at it
 
01:05:10.710 --> 01:05:10.720 align:start position:0%
but um
 
01:05:12.710 --> 01:05:12.720 align:start position:0%
again right i understand and i respect
 
01:05:14.390 --> 01:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
what you're saying right so i'm not
 
01:05:16.150 --> 01:05:16.160 align:start position:0%
suggesting that there was some sort of
 
01:05:17.349 --> 01:05:17.359 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:05:19.750 --> 01:05:19.760 align:start position:0%
zero-sum game here that with that
 
01:05:22.230 --> 01:05:22.240 align:start position:0%
specific bill but if we look at a broad
 
01:05:24.470 --> 01:05:24.480 align:start position:0%
range of bills and we think about okay
 
01:05:26.150 --> 01:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
so what are what are the priorities that
 
01:05:27.109 --> 01:05:27.119 align:start position:0%
we are
 
01:05:29.029 --> 01:05:29.039 align:start position:0%
uh emphasizing
 
01:05:32.549 --> 01:05:32.559 align:start position:0%
right so i just wanted to you know as i
 
01:05:34.789 --> 01:05:34.799 align:start position:0%
talked to uh the members of my caucus
 
01:05:36.470 --> 01:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
this morning when we discuss this bill i
 
01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:37.270 align:start position:0%
this morning when we discuss this bill i
just

01:05:37.270 --> 01:05:37.280 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:05:38.789 --> 01:05:38.799 align:start position:0%
we kind of need to look at it as a
 
01:05:41.270 --> 01:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
policy consideration the money side of
 
01:05:43.270 --> 01:05:43.280 align:start position:0%
it it's going to a second committee we
 
01:05:44.950 --> 01:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
kind of have to let finance do their job
 
01:05:46.470 --> 01:05:46.480 align:start position:0%
and i just want to remind the committee
 
01:05:49.190 --> 01:05:49.200 align:start position:0%
our job is the policy policy decision of
 
01:05:50.789 --> 01:05:50.799 align:start position:0%
do we think it's a good idea to support
 
01:05:53.990 --> 01:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
the state fairs with so making a grant
 
01:05:55.829 --> 01:05:55.839 align:start position:0%
program available so
 
01:05:58.870 --> 01:05:58.880 align:start position:0%
i saw hands uh representative murray
 
01:06:00.950 --> 01:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair for taking my
 
01:06:02.710 --> 01:06:02.720 align:start position:0%
question this question is actually for
 
01:06:06.630 --> 01:06:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:13.990 --> 01:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.309 align:start position:0%
 
welcome

01:06:16.309 --> 01:06:16.319 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
01:06:18.630 --> 01:06:18.640 align:start position:0%
good morning hi so thank you for taking
 
01:06:20.789 --> 01:06:20.799 align:start position:0%
my question the question that i do have
 
01:06:23.750 --> 01:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
is i'm curious to know
 
01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:24.789 align:start position:0%
is i'm curious to know
um

01:06:24.789 --> 01:06:24.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:27.029 --> 01:06:27.039 align:start position:0%
what portion of these buildings may or
 
01:06:28.870 --> 01:06:28.880 align:start position:0%
may not be considered historical in
 
01:06:32.390 --> 01:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
nature and does that affect at all the
 
01:06:36.710 --> 01:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:39.029 --> 01:06:39.039 align:start position:0%
to the well to the best of my knowledge
 
01:06:40.630 --> 01:06:40.640 align:start position:0%
you know i i think
 
01:06:42.710 --> 01:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
to be historically probably have to be
 
01:06:45.029 --> 01:06:45.039 align:start position:0%
on the state register or the national
 
01:06:48.710 --> 01:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
register i don't recall seeing any of
 
01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:49.829 align:start position:0%
register i don't recall seeing any of
those

01:06:49.829 --> 01:06:49.839 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:06:51.990 --> 01:06:52.000 align:start position:0%
those plaques there
 
01:06:53.750 --> 01:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
you know and i can
 
01:06:55.510 --> 01:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
only speak
 
01:06:57.750 --> 01:06:57.760 align:start position:0%
for my for myself not what the next
 
01:06:59.349 --> 01:06:59.359 align:start position:0%
commissioner may
 
01:07:01.190 --> 01:07:01.200 align:start position:0%
may feel but i think
 
01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:02.150 align:start position:0%
may feel but i think
that

01:07:02.150 --> 01:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:07:04.390 --> 01:07:04.400 align:start position:0%
if it's a building
 
01:07:07.430 --> 01:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
that is supporting agriculture
 
01:07:10.870 --> 01:07:10.880 align:start position:0%
uh i wouldn't look at it versus as
 
01:07:12.870 --> 01:07:12.880 align:start position:0%
what's the historical nature of it what
 
01:07:15.750 --> 01:07:15.760 align:start position:0%
is the the physical need to make make
 
01:07:18.309 --> 01:07:18.319 align:start position:0%
sure that whatever that building is
 
01:07:20.630 --> 01:07:20.640 align:start position:0%
that it stays in a usable
 
01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:21.750 align:start position:0%
that it stays in a usable
condition

01:07:21.750 --> 01:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
condition
 
01:07:23.910 --> 01:07:23.920 align:start position:0%
um so obviously in any building the
 
01:07:27.029 --> 01:07:27.039 align:start position:0%
first priority is really going to be be
 
01:07:28.870 --> 01:07:28.880 align:start position:0%
the roof and probably the second is
 
01:07:30.789 --> 01:07:30.799 align:start position:0%
going to be the foundation
 
01:07:33.829 --> 01:07:33.839 align:start position:0%
or maybe reverse but
 
01:07:35.270 --> 01:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
i guess if you don't have a good roof it
 
01:07:36.950 --> 01:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
really doesn't matter what condition the
 
01:07:40.150 --> 01:07:40.160 align:start position:0%
foundation is in but um
 
01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:41.349 align:start position:0%
foundation is in but um
so

01:07:41.349 --> 01:07:41.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:07:43.670 --> 01:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
but um you know they're they're both
 
01:07:46.789 --> 01:07:46.799 align:start position:0%
important but um i think making making
 
01:07:48.630 --> 01:07:48.640 align:start position:0%
sure that the building is usable is
 
01:07:49.990 --> 01:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
01:07:52.150 --> 01:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
uh the priority that anybody would look
 
01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:53.829 align:start position:0%
uh the priority that anybody would look
at

01:07:53.829 --> 01:07:53.839 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:07:55.670 --> 01:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
representative dutsy
 
01:07:58.230 --> 01:07:58.240 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you chair and thank you for
 
01:08:01.430 --> 01:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question who owns the building
 
01:08:03.670 --> 01:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
who owns the buildings now and who owns
 
01:08:05.910 --> 01:08:05.920 align:start position:0%
the land
 
01:08:08.710 --> 01:08:08.720 align:start position:0%
so to the best of my my knowledge the
 
01:08:10.710 --> 01:08:10.720 align:start position:0%
fair association
 
01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:11.829 align:start position:0%
fair association
owns

01:08:11.829 --> 01:08:11.839 align:start position:0%
owns
 
01:08:12.950 --> 01:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
the land
 
01:08:15.270 --> 01:08:15.280 align:start position:0%
lands and the buildings
 
01:08:18.870 --> 01:08:18.880 align:start position:0%
there may be cases where there
 
01:08:20.550 --> 01:08:20.560 align:start position:0%
is a different
 
01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:22.829 align:start position:0%
is a different
maintenance

01:08:22.829 --> 01:08:22.839 align:start position:0%
maintenance
 
01:08:25.030 --> 01:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
arrangement because i know there are
 
01:08:26.950 --> 01:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
cases where different organizations have
 
01:08:28.070 --> 01:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
put up
 
01:08:31.110 --> 01:08:31.120 align:start position:0%
buildings that they use exclusively but
 
01:08:32.789 --> 01:08:32.799 align:start position:0%
i think ultimately
 
01:08:35.829 --> 01:08:35.839 align:start position:0%
uh the buildings are probably owned by
 
01:08:38.309 --> 01:08:38.319 align:start position:0%
the fair association but i i really
 
01:08:38.319 --> 01:08:39.189 align:start position:0%
the fair association but i i really
can't

01:08:39.189 --> 01:08:39.199 align:start position:0%
can't
 
01:08:41.829 --> 01:08:41.839 align:start position:0%
speak to that
 
01:08:44.550 --> 01:08:44.560 align:start position:0%
thank you with any certainty
 
01:08:47.910 --> 01:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:50.470 --> 01:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:08:51.990 --> 01:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
in speaking about this bill and i
 
01:08:54.470 --> 01:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
understand uh with regards to competing
 
01:08:56.709 --> 01:08:56.719 align:start position:0%
funds and as you know i had an idea of
 
01:08:57.990 --> 01:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
where the money should come from and
 
01:09:00.390 --> 01:09:00.400 align:start position:0%
definitely not from the general fund
 
01:09:02.789 --> 01:09:02.799 align:start position:0%
but the other thing that we heard in
 
01:09:05.669 --> 01:09:05.679 align:start position:0%
testimony and discussion is that these
 
01:09:08.789 --> 01:09:08.799 align:start position:0%
fares are viable to our economy
 
01:09:10.870 --> 01:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
they bring in a lot of dollars
 
01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:11.749 align:start position:0%
they bring in a lot of dollars
to

01:09:11.749 --> 01:09:11.759 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:09:13.590 --> 01:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
our local businesses
 
01:09:16.630 --> 01:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
and they promote agriculture in a way to
 
01:09:18.149 --> 01:09:18.159 align:start position:0%
keep it alive
 
01:09:19.269 --> 01:09:19.279 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
01:09:21.510 --> 01:09:21.520 align:start position:0%
we are an agricultural state in many
 
01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:22.550 align:start position:0%
we are an agricultural state in many
ways

01:09:22.550 --> 01:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
ways
 
01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:24.789 align:start position:0%
ways
and

01:09:24.789 --> 01:09:24.799 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:09:26.709 --> 01:09:26.719 align:start position:0%
when i think of new hampshire i think of
 
01:09:28.950 --> 01:09:28.960 align:start position:0%
our rural communities our agriculture
 
01:09:30.630 --> 01:09:30.640 align:start position:0%
our our farms
 
01:09:32.149 --> 01:09:32.159 align:start position:0%
uh over four
 
01:09:33.910 --> 01:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
i forget i think it's over four thousand
 
01:09:37.030 --> 01:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
farms in the state um registered
 
01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:38.550 align:start position:0%
farms in the state um registered
so

01:09:38.550 --> 01:09:38.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:09:41.269 --> 01:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
i think keeping a lot and preserving our
 
01:09:44.550 --> 01:09:44.560 align:start position:0%
history as an agricultural community
 
01:09:47.910 --> 01:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
and promoting these county fairs is an
 
01:09:50.390 --> 01:09:50.400 align:start position:0%
economic interest not just purely
 
01:09:52.309 --> 01:09:52.319 align:start position:0%
helping with the maintenance of these
 
01:09:52.319 --> 01:09:53.430 align:start position:0%
helping with the maintenance of these
buildings

01:09:53.430 --> 01:09:53.440 align:start position:0%
buildings
 
01:09:56.390 --> 01:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
but the economies that support these
 
01:09:59.030 --> 01:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
fairs and the surrounding communities
 
01:09:59.040 --> 01:09:59.830 align:start position:0%
fairs and the surrounding communities
it's

01:09:59.830 --> 01:09:59.840 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:10:02.390 --> 01:10:02.400 align:start position:0%
so it it brings in dollars to the state
 
01:10:05.350 --> 01:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
it's not just an outflow it is it also
 
01:10:07.430 --> 01:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
you have to look at the inflow from the
 
01:10:11.590 --> 01:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:13.750 --> 01:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
representative mason
 
01:10:15.350 --> 01:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
well i'd just like to speak from my own
 
01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:18.149 align:start position:0%
well i'd just like to speak from my own
experience

01:10:18.149 --> 01:10:18.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:20.630 --> 01:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
my family did not have any agriculture
 
01:10:23.350 --> 01:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
when we first started but my first date
 
01:10:25.590 --> 01:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
with new hampshire affairs go back to
 
01:10:27.430 --> 01:10:27.440 align:start position:0%
some photographs and memories that date
 
01:10:30.870 --> 01:10:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:32.790 --> 01:10:32.800 align:start position:0%
i can say this
 
01:10:34.229 --> 01:10:34.239 align:start position:0%
i've had opportunity to work in
 
01:10:34.239 --> 01:10:35.669 align:start position:0%
i've had opportunity to work in
agricultural

01:10:35.669 --> 01:10:35.679 align:start position:0%
agricultural
 
01:10:38.229 --> 01:10:38.239 align:start position:0%
in many parts of the world
 
01:10:40.149 --> 01:10:40.159 align:start position:0%
i've worked as far away as new zealand
 
01:10:41.830 --> 01:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
australia england
 
01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:43.270 align:start position:0%
australia england
canada

01:10:43.270 --> 01:10:43.280 align:start position:0%
canada
 
01:10:44.950 --> 01:10:44.960 align:start position:0%
and throughout the western united states
 
01:10:48.149 --> 01:10:48.159 align:start position:0%
and eastern united states in agriculture
 
01:10:49.830 --> 01:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that we really see
 
01:10:52.470 --> 01:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
is just a demise in the family farm
 
01:10:55.270 --> 01:10:55.280 align:start position:0%
there's very few left
 
01:10:55.280 --> 01:10:56.790 align:start position:0%
there's very few left
that

01:10:56.790 --> 01:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:10:58.790 --> 01:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
the commissioner could speak on how many
 
01:11:01.110 --> 01:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
family farms are left in new hampshire i
 
01:11:02.630 --> 01:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
know representative pearl knows there's
 
01:11:04.870 --> 01:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
very few we've watched a lot of friends
 
01:11:06.950 --> 01:11:06.960 align:start position:0%
that have had to fold up take second
 
01:11:08.709 --> 01:11:08.719 align:start position:0%
seats and that but the one thing the new
 
01:11:10.550 --> 01:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire fairs do and they do a very
 
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:14.080 align:start position:0%
good job of it they educate young people
 
01:11:16.950 --> 01:11:16.960 align:start position:0%
to want to have a life in agriculture
 
01:11:19.030 --> 01:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
now i didn't come from that
 
01:11:20.310 --> 01:11:20.320 align:start position:0%
but yet
 
01:11:22.550 --> 01:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
two one of my brothers and myself both
 
01:11:25.189 --> 01:11:25.199 align:start position:0%
have spent a career in agriculture
 
01:11:27.750 --> 01:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
and if we don't support things like new
 
01:11:29.669 --> 01:11:29.679 align:start position:0%
hampshire fair programs and the youth
 
01:11:31.350 --> 01:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
programs in new hampshire
 
01:11:33.110 --> 01:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
it's far different than a festival of
 
01:11:35.510 --> 01:11:35.520 align:start position:0%
people having fun it's a lifestyle and
 
01:11:37.350 --> 01:11:37.360 align:start position:0%
it promotes agriculture and this
 
01:11:39.030 --> 01:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
committee is
 
01:11:40.550 --> 01:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
committee of agriculture
 
01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:41.910 align:start position:0%
committee of agriculture
so

01:11:41.910 --> 01:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:11:43.990 --> 01:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm in favor of it
 
01:11:46.870 --> 01:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:48.070 --> 01:11:48.080 align:start position:0%
any further questions for the
 
01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:49.750 align:start position:0%
any further questions for the
commissioner

01:11:49.750 --> 01:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
01:11:52.470 --> 01:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
bixby yeah i was just wondering um
 
01:11:56.149 --> 01:11:56.159 align:start position:0%
is the are the fair associations a um
 
01:11:57.910 --> 01:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
are they public bodies or are they
 
01:12:02.550 --> 01:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:03.990 align:start position:0%
 
well

01:12:03.990 --> 01:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:12:05.350 --> 01:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
they are
 
01:12:07.189 --> 01:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
to the best of my knowledge
 
01:12:08.709 --> 01:12:08.719 align:start position:0%
they are
 
01:12:11.590 --> 01:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
registered non-non-profit
 
01:12:12.709 --> 01:12:12.719 align:start position:0%
so that
 
01:12:14.149 --> 01:12:14.159 align:start position:0%
you know they're like any other
 
01:12:16.630 --> 01:12:16.640 align:start position:0%
non-profit people
 
01:12:19.990 --> 01:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
can can join the associations there they
 
01:12:22.709 --> 01:12:22.719 align:start position:0%
have elections to um
 
01:12:24.390 --> 01:12:24.400 align:start position:0%
for their officers
 
01:12:26.149 --> 01:12:26.159 align:start position:0%
et cetera so
 
01:12:27.590 --> 01:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if that answers your
 
01:12:29.350 --> 01:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
question but i'm not sure i understand
 
01:12:31.510 --> 01:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
it a hundred percent either okay so i
 
01:12:34.550 --> 01:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
can clarify so i'm wondering if they are
 
01:12:36.709 --> 01:12:36.719 align:start position:0%
under the jurisdiction of
 
01:12:39.350 --> 01:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
the state or of a county or of uh
 
01:12:42.149 --> 01:12:42.159 align:start position:0%
municipality or with are they
 
01:12:42.159 --> 01:12:43.669 align:start position:0%
municipality or with are they
uh

01:12:43.669 --> 01:12:43.679 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:12:45.669 --> 01:12:45.679 align:start position:0%
private nonprofits
 
01:12:47.590 --> 01:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
well i think they're they're probably
 
01:12:49.990 --> 01:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
private non-profits
 
01:12:51.350 --> 01:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
in the sense
 
01:12:53.910 --> 01:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
that your local historical society would
 
01:12:57.510 --> 01:12:57.520 align:start position:0%
be your lions club your your kiwanis the
 
01:13:00.790 --> 01:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
grange any of those there is
 
01:13:03.669 --> 01:13:03.679 align:start position:0%
certainly uh state oversight in terms of
 
01:13:05.669 --> 01:13:05.679 align:start position:0%
how they operate and how they deal with
 
01:13:07.350 --> 01:13:07.360 align:start position:0%
their money and
 
01:13:08.950 --> 01:13:08.960 align:start position:0%
there are federal
 
01:13:12.870 --> 01:13:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:14.950 --> 01:13:14.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:13:16.830 --> 01:13:16.840 align:start position:0%
any further thoughts uh representative
 
01:13:20.550 --> 01:13:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:21.990 --> 01:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
do you know how
 
01:13:24.390 --> 01:13:24.400 align:start position:0%
fares are run in other states for for
 
01:13:27.110 --> 01:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
example i grew up in michigan
 
01:13:29.110 --> 01:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
i remember going to the michigan state
 
01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:30.390 align:start position:0%
i remember going to the michigan state
fair

01:13:30.390 --> 01:13:30.400 align:start position:0%
fair
 
01:13:32.390 --> 01:13:32.400 align:start position:0%
the state fairgrounds was the state
 
01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:33.669 align:start position:0%
the state fairgrounds was the state
fairgrounds

01:13:33.669 --> 01:13:33.679 align:start position:0%
fairgrounds
 
01:13:35.750 --> 01:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
but again i don't know if we had
 
01:13:39.669 --> 01:13:39.679 align:start position:0%
regional fares like they they do here
 
01:13:42.470 --> 01:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
so what uh what do they do in other
 
01:13:45.430 --> 01:13:45.440 align:start position:0%
states and my and my question is is are
 
01:13:47.830 --> 01:13:47.840 align:start position:0%
we looking at the wrong bill
 
01:13:51.110 --> 01:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
and should we be looking at um
 
01:13:52.950 --> 01:13:52.960 align:start position:0%
maybe bringing
 
01:13:55.430 --> 01:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
agricultural fares under the auspices of
 
01:13:57.669 --> 01:13:57.679 align:start position:0%
the government similar to what we have
 
01:14:00.630 --> 01:14:00.640 align:start position:0%
like with parks with our state parks
 
01:14:02.790 --> 01:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
because it is
 
01:14:05.110 --> 01:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
so ingrained in our culture
 
01:14:06.870 --> 01:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
well i would certainly not recommend
 
01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:07.669 align:start position:0%
well i would certainly not recommend
that

01:14:07.669 --> 01:14:07.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:14:11.110 --> 01:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure what other
 
01:14:13.270 --> 01:14:13.280 align:start position:0%
states do i know that some of them have
 
01:14:14.550 --> 01:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
much more
 
01:14:16.709 --> 01:14:16.719 align:start position:0%
involvement but i've never looked at it
 
01:14:18.070 --> 01:14:18.080 align:start position:0%
how they are
 
01:14:20.630 --> 01:14:20.640 align:start position:0%
are set up what i meant was some
 
01:14:22.550 --> 01:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
some departments of agriculture have
 
01:14:25.350 --> 01:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
much more involvement in individual
 
01:14:27.910 --> 01:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
state state fairs and some truly are
 
01:14:29.669 --> 01:14:29.679 align:start position:0%
state fairs where we
 
01:14:32.390 --> 01:14:32.400 align:start position:0%
don't have anything any fair designated
 
01:14:33.669 --> 01:14:33.679 align:start position:0%
by the government
 
01:14:37.270 --> 01:14:37.280 align:start position:0%
i think that for the most part um
 
01:14:40.070 --> 01:14:40.080 align:start position:0%
we do a pretty good job but our fares
 
01:14:43.430 --> 01:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
are are struggling and i think that
 
01:14:45.510 --> 01:14:45.520 align:start position:0%
trying to bring
 
01:14:47.750 --> 01:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
more uh government
 
01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:49.189 align:start position:0%
more uh government
involvement

01:14:49.189 --> 01:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
involvement
 
01:14:50.790 --> 01:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
at that level would probably end up
 
01:14:53.990 --> 01:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
being a lot more expensive for us than
 
01:14:55.110 --> 01:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
than this
 
01:14:57.669 --> 01:14:57.679 align:start position:0%
uh level of of support
 
01:14:59.669 --> 01:14:59.679 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:15:01.590 --> 01:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
yeah they're
 
01:15:03.669 --> 01:15:03.679 align:start position:0%
it's it's a difficult situation and it
 
01:15:05.590 --> 01:15:05.600 align:start position:0%
is different um
 
01:15:07.669 --> 01:15:07.679 align:start position:0%
i think in in every state
 
01:15:10.310 --> 01:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
um but i think we've got a pretty good
 
01:15:12.630 --> 01:15:12.640 align:start position:0%
system but i think again
 
01:15:15.590 --> 01:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
for the last roughly 40 years the state
 
01:15:17.590 --> 01:15:17.600 align:start position:0%
has not been
 
01:15:19.990 --> 01:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
supportive of our fares whereas
 
01:15:21.990 --> 01:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
for the previous
 
01:15:24.709 --> 01:15:24.719 align:start position:0%
40 years and even
 
01:15:26.550 --> 01:15:26.560 align:start position:0%
going back
 
01:15:28.870 --> 01:15:28.880 align:start position:0%
to the 1800s
 
01:15:30.470 --> 01:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
the legislature
 
01:15:33.430 --> 01:15:33.440 align:start position:0%
was supportive of our our affairs we are
 
01:15:35.590 --> 01:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
in a period of time which i think is
 
01:15:36.950 --> 01:15:36.960 align:start position:0%
pretty unusual
 
01:15:38.470 --> 01:15:38.480 align:start position:0%
in that there is no
 
01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:41.280 align:start position:0%
state support really
 
01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:42.149 align:start position:0%
state support really
for

01:15:42.149 --> 01:15:42.159 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:15:44.390 --> 01:15:44.400 align:start position:0%
a longer period of time than has existed
 
01:15:47.030 --> 01:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
before and i think we're seeing
 
01:15:49.510 --> 01:15:49.520 align:start position:0%
the affairs suffering because of that if
 
01:15:52.709 --> 01:15:52.719 align:start position:0%
we had sunny weekends all the time
 
01:15:55.030 --> 01:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
and no other issues this probably
 
01:15:57.189 --> 01:15:57.199 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be necessary but
 
01:16:00.310 --> 01:16:00.320 align:start position:0%
like everything i said before we have
 
01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:02.070 align:start position:0%
like everything i said before we have
some

01:16:02.070 --> 01:16:02.080 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:03.990 align:start position:0%
some
difficult

01:16:03.990 --> 01:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
01:16:06.709 --> 01:16:06.719 align:start position:0%
weather and it's it's showing in some of
 
01:16:09.030 --> 01:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
these facilities
 
01:16:11.669 --> 01:16:11.679 align:start position:0%
representative aaron thank you mr chair
 
01:16:13.510 --> 01:16:13.520 align:start position:0%
do you know if any of the counties
 
01:16:16.630 --> 01:16:16.640 align:start position:0%
support these fairs financially
 
01:16:18.550 --> 01:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
i have never heard of that i think that
 
01:16:19.510 --> 01:16:19.520 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:16:22.149 --> 01:16:22.159 align:start position:0%
you're probably all members of different
 
01:16:24.390 --> 01:16:24.400 align:start position:0%
delegations and i wouldn't be surprised
 
01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:25.189 align:start position:0%
delegations and i wouldn't be surprised
if

01:16:25.189 --> 01:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:16:25.199 --> 01:16:25.990 align:start position:0%
if
all

01:16:25.990 --> 01:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:16:28.870 --> 01:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
10 counties were represented on your
 
01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:29.910 align:start position:0%
10 counties were represented on your
committee

01:16:29.910 --> 01:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:16:31.669 --> 01:16:31.679 align:start position:0%
uh and i think you could best answer
 
01:16:33.830 --> 01:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
those questions i know that hillsborough
 
01:16:36.790 --> 01:16:36.800 align:start position:0%
county certainly has never put any money
 
01:16:38.630 --> 01:16:38.640 align:start position:0%
into any of the fairs that exist within
 
01:16:41.350 --> 01:16:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:42.630 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:16:42.630 --> 01:16:42.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:16:45.270 --> 01:16:45.280 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr chair uh yeah as
 
01:16:47.110 --> 01:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
being part of the executive
 
01:16:49.590 --> 01:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
committee of hillsborough county i mean
 
01:16:51.990 --> 01:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
the function of the county is really to
 
01:16:54.390 --> 01:16:54.400 align:start position:0%
take care of the jail uh the nursing
 
01:16:58.630 --> 01:16:58.640 align:start position:0%
homes and um i think what is a policing
 
01:17:01.110 --> 01:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
like the the sheriff's department and i
 
01:17:03.990 --> 01:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
can i can tell you our budgets
 
01:17:07.189 --> 01:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
are scrutinized very very strongly we do
 
01:17:09.030 --> 01:17:09.040 align:start position:0%
support uh
 
01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:10.229 align:start position:0%
support uh
the

01:17:10.229 --> 01:17:10.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:17:11.910 --> 01:17:11.920 align:start position:0%
unh extension
 
01:17:13.910 --> 01:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
so some of the money you know does does
 
01:17:14.870 --> 01:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
go to
 
01:17:17.110 --> 01:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
a portion of that for 4-h and that type
 
01:17:18.709 --> 01:17:18.719 align:start position:0%
of thing
 
01:17:18.719 --> 01:17:19.590 align:start position:0%
of thing
but

01:17:19.590 --> 01:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:17:20.790 --> 01:17:20.800 align:start position:0%
you know every
 
01:17:23.990 --> 01:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
penny is scrutinized and we've had to do
 
01:17:26.630 --> 01:17:26.640 align:start position:0%
we've had to spend a lot of money
 
01:17:29.030 --> 01:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
on just retaining people
 
01:17:32.310 --> 01:17:32.320 align:start position:0%
so giving a lot of retention bonuses uh
 
01:17:34.310 --> 01:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
because the nursing home has been under
 
01:17:37.110 --> 01:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
uh such strain
 
01:17:39.430 --> 01:17:39.440 align:start position:0%
representative comptroll
 
01:17:41.270 --> 01:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um basically
 
01:17:43.270 --> 01:17:43.280 align:start position:0%
representative dutsy touched upon what i
 
01:17:45.110 --> 01:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
was going to talk about
 
01:17:48.229 --> 01:17:48.239 align:start position:0%
unh cooperative extension in our county
 
01:17:51.189 --> 01:17:51.199 align:start position:0%
is very active as is 4-h and they are
 
01:17:54.070 --> 01:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
involved in the belknap county
 
01:17:56.550 --> 01:17:56.560 align:start position:0%
fair i don't know to what extent
 
01:17:59.030 --> 01:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
but i know that 4-h
 
01:18:00.950 --> 01:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
shows there
 
01:18:04.070 --> 01:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
and i am sure that um they help out with
 
01:18:05.830 --> 01:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
whatever they can
 
01:18:08.070 --> 01:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
to make that a successful affair
 
01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:08.870 align:start position:0%
to make that a successful affair
so

01:18:08.870 --> 01:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:18:12.229 --> 01:18:12.239 align:start position:0%
may the county does not give out dollars
 
01:18:13.910 --> 01:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
per se to the fair
 
01:18:15.510 --> 01:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
but i think through
 
01:18:17.110 --> 01:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
some of the organizations that we
 
01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:18.310 align:start position:0%
some of the organizations that we
support

01:18:18.310 --> 01:18:18.320 align:start position:0%
support
 
01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:19.510 align:start position:0%
support
financially

01:18:19.510 --> 01:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
financially
 
01:18:23.990 --> 01:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:27.270 --> 01:18:27.280 align:start position:0%
representative almighty
 
01:18:29.270 --> 01:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner
 
01:18:31.350 --> 01:18:31.360 align:start position:0%
good on
 
01:18:36.070 --> 01:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
i asked do you know anything about uh
 
01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:36.950 align:start position:0%
i asked do you know anything about uh
on

01:18:36.950 --> 01:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:38.310 align:start position:0%
on
whether

01:18:38.310 --> 01:18:38.320 align:start position:0%
whether
 
01:18:40.470 --> 01:18:40.480 align:start position:0%
there is money left
 
01:18:43.189 --> 01:18:43.199 align:start position:0%
in the arpa money
 
01:18:43.199 --> 01:18:44.550 align:start position:0%
in the arpa money
that

01:18:44.550 --> 01:18:44.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:18:47.270 --> 01:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:48.550 align:start position:0%
 
acquired

01:18:48.550 --> 01:18:48.560 align:start position:0%
acquired
 
01:18:51.270 --> 01:18:51.280 align:start position:0%
for this purpose
 
01:18:53.430 --> 01:18:53.440 align:start position:0%
and if so
 
01:18:53.440 --> 01:18:54.630 align:start position:0%
and if so
whether

01:18:54.630 --> 01:18:54.640 align:start position:0%
whether
 
01:18:56.550 --> 01:18:56.560 align:start position:0%
it would help the fairs to have a
 
01:19:00.950 --> 01:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:03.270 --> 01:19:03.280 align:start position:0%
that really is something i
 
01:19:06.470 --> 01:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
i don't know um
 
01:19:08.470 --> 01:19:08.480 align:start position:0%
at this point there have not been any
 
01:19:09.750 --> 01:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
arpa funds
 
01:19:12.149 --> 01:19:12.159 align:start position:0%
that have been apportioned for
 
01:19:16.630 --> 01:19:16.640 align:start position:0%
for agriculture and i think that um
 
01:19:19.669 --> 01:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
what would be would be if one-time funds
 
01:19:21.270 --> 01:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
and i think that it
 
01:19:23.669 --> 01:19:23.679 align:start position:0%
a revolving fund is what is
 
01:19:25.590 --> 01:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
is necessary here because these are not
 
01:19:26.709 --> 01:19:26.719 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
01:19:28.229 --> 01:19:28.239 align:start position:0%
expenses that
 
01:19:28.239 --> 01:19:30.630 align:start position:0%
expenses that
are

01:19:30.630 --> 01:19:30.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:32.110 --> 01:19:32.120 align:start position:0%
going to go away they're going to be
 
01:19:36.790 --> 01:19:36.800 align:start position:0%
continuing infrastructure needs
 
01:19:39.030 --> 01:19:39.040 align:start position:0%
representative bixby yeah i'm wondering
 
01:19:41.350 --> 01:19:41.360 align:start position:0%
if there might be a
 
01:19:43.669 --> 01:19:43.679 align:start position:0%
mechanism for funding that does not rely
 
01:19:45.590 --> 01:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
on the general fund
 
01:19:49.189 --> 01:19:49.199 align:start position:0%
there are a number of uh
 
01:19:51.669 --> 01:19:51.679 align:start position:0%
sort of narrow purposes that we cover in
 
01:19:54.790 --> 01:19:54.800 align:start position:0%
the state using some sort of a fee
 
01:19:58.229 --> 01:19:58.239 align:start position:0%
rather than uh rather than a fund that
 
01:20:00.470 --> 01:20:00.480 align:start position:0%
rather than drawing on the general fund
 
01:20:03.030 --> 01:20:03.040 align:start position:0%
um and i'm wondering if there might be
 
01:20:05.189 --> 01:20:05.199 align:start position:0%
some other avenue for
 
01:20:05.199 --> 01:20:05.990 align:start position:0%
some other avenue for
uh

01:20:05.990 --> 01:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:20:08.229 --> 01:20:08.239 align:start position:0%
for funding this as opposed to the uh
 
01:20:11.669 --> 01:20:11.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:13.830 --> 01:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
i i suppose anything is possible when
 
01:20:16.310 --> 01:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
you spoke earlier about cbd i was
 
01:20:18.950 --> 01:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
thinking well there's a clear case to me
 
01:20:21.189 --> 01:20:21.199 align:start position:0%
where those who are buying the product
 
01:20:23.350 --> 01:20:23.360 align:start position:0%
could have an assessment that would go
 
01:20:25.669 --> 01:20:25.679 align:start position:0%
to support the activity of testing i
 
01:20:27.830 --> 01:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
don't know of any way
 
01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:29.030 align:start position:0%
don't know of any way
really

01:20:29.030 --> 01:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:20:32.790 --> 01:20:32.800 align:start position:0%
to do that with with the fares um
 
01:20:35.270 --> 01:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
because if they had the ability to raise
 
01:20:36.709 --> 01:20:36.719 align:start position:0%
enough money
 
01:20:38.870 --> 01:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
then they you know at each fair they
 
01:20:40.790 --> 01:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
would probably be
 
01:20:42.870 --> 01:20:42.880 align:start position:0%
be doing that now i don't you know to be
 
01:20:45.030 --> 01:20:45.040 align:start position:0%
honest i don't see this as
 
01:20:46.709 --> 01:20:46.719 align:start position:0%
something where every fare is going to
 
01:20:49.830 --> 01:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
get an equal amount even based on
 
01:20:51.430 --> 01:20:51.440 align:start position:0%
gate attendance
 
01:20:52.950 --> 01:20:52.960 align:start position:0%
they're going to be a lot of factors
 
01:20:56.629 --> 01:20:56.639 align:start position:0%
some fares could go probably a long time
 
01:20:58.550 --> 01:20:58.560 align:start position:0%
without getting anything because of the
 
01:21:00.870 --> 01:21:00.880 align:start position:0%
fact that they have
 
01:21:02.709 --> 01:21:02.719 align:start position:0%
you know huge attendance
 
01:21:04.390 --> 01:21:04.400 align:start position:0%
but in terms of
 
01:21:06.149 --> 01:21:06.159 align:start position:0%
trying to assess
 
01:21:07.830 --> 01:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
somebody else
 
01:21:10.709 --> 01:21:10.719 align:start position:0%
some fee for this i don't really
 
01:21:12.390 --> 01:21:12.400 align:start position:0%
see that as viable
 
01:21:15.189 --> 01:21:15.199 align:start position:0%
you know and i hear about general fund
 
01:21:17.910 --> 01:21:17.920 align:start position:0%
versus coming from some other source
 
01:21:20.390 --> 01:21:20.400 align:start position:0%
you know i sort of view wherever money
 
01:21:22.629 --> 01:21:22.639 align:start position:0%
comes from as being
 
01:21:25.350 --> 01:21:25.360 align:start position:0%
you know one pocket and you can call it
 
01:21:27.189 --> 01:21:27.199 align:start position:0%
one thing or another but at the end of
 
01:21:29.910 --> 01:21:29.920 align:start position:0%
the day there's only a finite amount of
 
01:21:31.510 --> 01:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
money available to the state for all
 
01:21:31.520 --> 01:21:32.310 align:start position:0%
money available to the state for all
their

01:21:32.310 --> 01:21:32.320 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:21:34.709 --> 01:21:34.719 align:start position:0%
expenditures so if you say well we're
 
01:21:36.550 --> 01:21:36.560 align:start position:0%
going to take this money from this fund
 
01:21:38.390 --> 01:21:38.400 align:start position:0%
well that money was probably going to
 
01:21:40.470 --> 01:21:40.480 align:start position:0%
the general fund anyhow and so now
 
01:21:42.550 --> 01:21:42.560 align:start position:0%
you've just switched it switched it
 
01:21:44.470 --> 01:21:44.480 align:start position:0%
around so i think it really is a matter
 
01:21:46.390 --> 01:21:46.400 align:start position:0%
of is this
 
01:21:46.400 --> 01:21:47.590 align:start position:0%
of is this
something

01:21:47.590 --> 01:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:21:49.750 --> 01:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
that the state should be supporting or
 
01:21:51.750 --> 01:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
not that is the policy
 
01:21:53.669 --> 01:21:53.679 align:start position:0%
the policy question
 
01:21:56.229 --> 01:21:56.239 align:start position:0%
are there other funds available such as
 
01:21:58.709 --> 01:21:58.719 align:start position:0%
the specialty block grants which
 
01:21:58.719 --> 01:21:59.430 align:start position:0%
the specialty block grants which
the

01:21:59.430 --> 01:21:59.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:22:01.669 --> 01:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
the federal government's already putting
 
01:22:03.350 --> 01:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
a good amount of money into new
 
01:22:04.950 --> 01:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire for that
 
01:22:06.070 --> 01:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
we just
 
01:22:08.709 --> 01:22:08.719 align:start position:0%
accepted i think another 189 thousand
 
01:22:12.790 --> 01:22:12.800 align:start position:0%
that was an additional amount
 
01:22:15.110 --> 01:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
over and above what is normally
 
01:22:17.750 --> 01:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
appropriated by the feds for specialty
 
01:22:19.189 --> 01:22:19.199 align:start position:0%
crop and that
 
01:22:20.390 --> 01:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
goes to a
 
01:22:22.390 --> 01:22:22.400 align:start position:0%
limited group of people for them to
 
01:22:25.030 --> 01:22:25.040 align:start position:0%
promote their products essentially it's
 
01:22:27.669 --> 01:22:27.679 align:start position:0%
it go those type of funds don't go to
 
01:22:30.709 --> 01:22:30.719 align:start position:0%
the individual farmers they go to
 
01:22:32.709 --> 01:22:32.719 align:start position:0%
like the fruit growers association to
 
01:22:34.870 --> 01:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
promote the products of all of their
 
01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:35.990 align:start position:0%
promote the products of all of their
members

01:22:35.990 --> 01:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
members
 
01:22:38.790 --> 01:22:38.800 align:start position:0%
um whereas this is like
 
01:22:40.870 --> 01:22:40.880 align:start position:0%
you know a situation where
 
01:22:43.830 --> 01:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
we're just trying to keep the fairs from
 
01:22:48.310 --> 01:22:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:49.590 --> 01:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
follow it
 
01:22:52.149 --> 01:22:52.159 align:start position:0%
uh another thought that occurs to me is
 
01:22:52.159 --> 01:22:53.910 align:start position:0%
uh another thought that occurs to me is
that

01:22:53.910 --> 01:22:53.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:22:55.830 --> 01:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
because this is essentially capital
 
01:22:57.990 --> 01:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
maintenance would this be something that
 
01:22:59.510 --> 01:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
would make more sense to put into the
 
01:23:04.790 --> 01:23:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:06.950 --> 01:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
to the best of my knowledge
 
01:23:09.830 --> 01:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
capital budget goes for
 
01:23:09.840 --> 01:23:10.790 align:start position:0%
capital budget goes for
state

01:23:10.790 --> 01:23:10.800 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:23:13.669 --> 01:23:13.679 align:start position:0%
state building state projects
 
01:23:13.679 --> 01:23:14.950 align:start position:0%
state building state projects
um

01:23:14.950 --> 01:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:17.669 --> 01:23:17.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:21.830 --> 01:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:22.950 --> 01:23:22.960 align:start position:0%
how that
 
01:23:25.110 --> 01:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
would work
 
01:23:29.030 --> 01:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
potentially it could i'm not
 
01:23:31.590 --> 01:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
saying that it shouldn't but that adds a
 
01:23:33.430 --> 01:23:33.440 align:start position:0%
whole different layer
 
01:23:35.510 --> 01:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
certainly would take a while
 
01:23:38.470 --> 01:23:38.480 align:start position:0%
longer i mean i i suppose i suppose it
 
01:23:40.229 --> 01:23:40.239 align:start position:0%
could i'm not sure what the different
 
01:23:43.189 --> 01:23:43.199 align:start position:0%
ends up difference ends up being because
 
01:23:46.709 --> 01:23:46.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:48.550 --> 01:23:48.560 align:start position:0%
something that would be bonded so it
 
01:23:51.590 --> 01:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
would just add to another layer which is
 
01:23:54.070 --> 01:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
fine because i'm not looking for
 
01:23:54.080 --> 01:23:55.189 align:start position:0%
fine because i'm not looking for
another

01:23:55.189 --> 01:23:55.199 align:start position:0%
another
 
01:23:57.669 --> 01:23:57.679 align:start position:0%
uh job myself
 
01:23:57.679 --> 01:23:58.950 align:start position:0%
uh job myself
but

01:23:58.950 --> 01:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:24:01.350 --> 01:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
um i don't know in the
 
01:24:03.750 --> 01:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
in the grand scheme of things
 
01:24:05.350 --> 01:24:05.360 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
01:24:06.310 --> 01:24:06.320 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:24:09.189 --> 01:24:09.199 align:start position:0%
a whole bunch of little buildings spread
 
01:24:10.950 --> 01:24:10.960 align:start position:0%
out all over the state
 
01:24:12.950 --> 01:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
owned by
 
01:24:16.550 --> 01:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
12 or 14 different organizations
 
01:24:19.669 --> 01:24:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:21.990 --> 01:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
that level of
 
01:24:24.950 --> 01:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
commitment on the part of a already busy
 
01:24:27.110 --> 01:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
group of people
 
01:24:29.590 --> 01:24:29.600 align:start position:0%
where where that would wash out unless
 
01:24:32.550 --> 01:24:32.560 align:start position:0%
there was a again a specific
 
01:24:36.229 --> 01:24:36.239 align:start position:0%
amendment to that process that said you
 
01:24:37.510 --> 01:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
you shall
 
01:24:37.520 --> 01:24:39.030 align:start position:0%
you shall
appropriate

01:24:39.030 --> 01:24:39.040 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
01:24:41.030 --> 01:24:41.040 align:start position:0%
up to and that that's part of the
 
01:24:43.350 --> 01:24:43.360 align:start position:0%
problem too i also see that they're
 
01:24:45.189 --> 01:24:45.199 align:start position:0%
going to be years when
 
01:24:47.669 --> 01:24:47.679 align:start position:0%
we're probably not going to award 250
 
01:24:49.270 --> 01:24:49.280 align:start position:0%
000 knowing that there are some bigger
 
01:24:51.350 --> 01:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
projects coming down the road so you'd
 
01:24:52.229 --> 01:24:52.239 align:start position:0%
want to
 
01:24:53.830 --> 01:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
you know say all right maybe this year
 
01:24:56.950 --> 01:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
there's only critical needs of 150 000
 
01:24:59.030 --> 01:24:59.040 align:start position:0%
knowing we've got to have money
 
01:25:01.510 --> 01:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
available so for some bigger ones
 
01:25:04.390 --> 01:25:04.400 align:start position:0%
uh in in years coming down down the road
 
01:25:06.870 --> 01:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
much as most of us plan if we know we're
 
01:25:09.430 --> 01:25:09.440 align:start position:0%
going to replace a roof on our house or
 
01:25:12.709 --> 01:25:12.719 align:start position:0%
or something it's not going to be 250
 
01:25:15.030 --> 01:25:15.040 align:start position:0%
000 every single year
 
01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:15.750 align:start position:0%
000 every single year
so

01:25:15.750 --> 01:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:25:18.070 --> 01:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
i i'm having a hard time
 
01:25:19.590 --> 01:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
short period of time trying to figure
 
01:25:23.910 --> 01:25:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:26.229 --> 01:25:26.239 align:start position:0%
the program for for capital improvements
 
01:25:27.990 --> 01:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
for the entire state well i think
 
01:25:29.189 --> 01:25:29.199 align:start position:0%
commissioner that's probably a better
 
01:25:30.709 --> 01:25:30.719 align:start position:0%
question for the finance committee than
 
01:25:33.350 --> 01:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
it is ena anyway so representative
 
01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:34.870 align:start position:0%
it is ena anyway so representative
murray

01:25:34.870 --> 01:25:34.880 align:start position:0%
murray
 
01:25:36.629 --> 01:25:36.639 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um
 
01:25:39.910 --> 01:25:39.920 align:start position:0%
thank you also um to the commissioner so
 
01:25:41.750 --> 01:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
you stated that there are roughly 12 to
 
01:25:43.910 --> 01:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
14 buildings depending on
 
01:25:46.470 --> 01:25:46.480 align:start position:0%
no no 12 12 i can't remember the number
 
01:25:48.310 --> 01:25:48.320 align:start position:0%
of fares i should have counted it up
 
01:25:50.629 --> 01:25:50.639 align:start position:0%
it's it's changed a little bit
 
01:25:50.639 --> 01:25:51.430 align:start position:0%
it's it's changed a little bit
um

01:25:51.430 --> 01:25:51.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:54.950 --> 01:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
but no fairs and they all have multiple
 
01:25:58.470 --> 01:25:58.480 align:start position:0%
buildings 12 to 14 fares thank you um so
 
01:26:00.310 --> 01:26:00.320 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:26:01.510 --> 01:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:26:03.030 --> 01:26:03.040 align:start position:0%
in addition to that question i guess
 
01:26:05.669 --> 01:26:05.679 align:start position:0%
then um
 
01:26:07.430 --> 01:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
once the application you had mentioned
 
01:26:09.030 --> 01:26:09.040 align:start position:0%
this previously a little bit that the
 
01:26:10.629 --> 01:26:10.639 align:start position:0%
application would come to you with a
 
01:26:13.350 --> 01:26:13.360 align:start position:0%
request for these repairs and and
 
01:26:13.360 --> 01:26:15.350 align:start position:0%
request for these repairs and and
um

01:26:15.350 --> 01:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:16.870 --> 01:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
is there a group of individuals that
 
01:26:19.270 --> 01:26:19.280 align:start position:0%
would look at the application and decide
 
01:26:21.430 --> 01:26:21.440 align:start position:0%
who gets awarded what let's say all 12
 
01:26:25.990 --> 01:26:26.000 align:start position:0%
or 14 fairs apply that year or two apply
 
01:26:28.310 --> 01:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
how was that grant awarding process i
 
01:26:31.590 --> 01:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
didn't write the bill and i'm not
 
01:26:34.310 --> 01:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
familiar if there's a process laid out
 
01:26:35.990 --> 01:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
there or not it's within the department
 
01:26:39.030 --> 01:26:39.040 align:start position:0%
of agriculture if it's left
 
01:26:41.189 --> 01:26:41.199 align:start position:0%
solely to the discretion
 
01:26:44.070 --> 01:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
of the commissioner i would probably
 
01:26:46.870 --> 01:26:46.880 align:start position:0%
have a group of of people and we would
 
01:26:48.950 --> 01:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
most likely
 
01:26:51.669 --> 01:26:51.679 align:start position:0%
go out and do a physical site visit to
 
01:26:53.189 --> 01:26:53.199 align:start position:0%
those fairs and look
 
01:26:55.189 --> 01:26:55.199 align:start position:0%
at the buildings
 
01:26:57.189 --> 01:26:57.199 align:start position:0%
to really evaluate them because even
 
01:26:58.790 --> 01:26:58.800 align:start position:0%
even pictures aren't going to tell the
 
01:27:00.790 --> 01:27:00.800 align:start position:0%
whole whole story
 
01:27:03.750 --> 01:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
so my anticipation would be that when
 
01:27:05.669 --> 01:27:05.679 align:start position:0%
fairs made applications we would do a
 
01:27:06.950 --> 01:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
site visit
 
01:27:09.430 --> 01:27:09.440 align:start position:0%
look at the actual condition of
 
01:27:11.030 --> 01:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
of the roof the foundation whatever it
 
01:27:13.030 --> 01:27:13.040 align:start position:0%
was they were were looking for i mean
 
01:27:15.430 --> 01:27:15.440 align:start position:0%
this is the bill that representative
 
01:27:18.470 --> 01:27:18.480 align:start position:0%
ladd came up with i did assist him with
 
01:27:19.990 --> 01:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
it but this was not a department
 
01:27:22.870 --> 01:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:24.310 --> 01:27:24.320 align:start position:0%
so i'm just going to give you a quick
 
01:27:26.709 --> 01:27:26.719 align:start position:0%
answer so um
 
01:27:28.790 --> 01:27:28.800 align:start position:0%
in the we've given the bill would give
 
01:27:30.470 --> 01:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
the commissioner
 
01:27:32.550 --> 01:27:32.560 align:start position:0%
have him adopt bulls relative to the
 
01:27:34.149 --> 01:27:34.159 align:start position:0%
administration of the
 
01:27:35.910 --> 01:27:35.920 align:start position:0%
capital improvement grant program so
 
01:27:38.390 --> 01:27:38.400 align:start position:0%
that's how that would be handled
 
01:27:43.110 --> 01:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:43.120 --> 01:27:44.070 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:27:44.070 --> 01:27:44.080 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:27:45.510 --> 01:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
that the bill does call for that
 
01:27:47.510 --> 01:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
representative dutzy
 
01:27:47.520 --> 01:27:48.870 align:start position:0%
representative dutzy
uh

01:27:48.870 --> 01:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:27:51.430 --> 01:27:51.440 align:start position:0%
yes i mean if i if i'm looking at the
 
01:27:52.950 --> 01:27:52.960 align:start position:0%
the financial statement i mean they're
 
01:27:52.960 --> 01:27:53.990 align:start position:0%
the financial statement i mean they're
talking

01:27:53.990 --> 01:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
talking
 
01:27:56.629 --> 01:27:56.639 align:start position:0%
and they're just dividing it out 250 000
 
01:27:58.870 --> 01:27:58.880 align:start position:0%
they're talking about 13 fares
 
01:28:00.709 --> 01:28:00.719 align:start position:0%
so let's just say twenty thousand
 
01:28:03.030 --> 01:28:03.040 align:start position:0%
dollars for fair sight
 
01:28:05.910 --> 01:28:05.920 align:start position:0%
um that doesn't seem to me to be an
 
01:28:07.510 --> 01:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
awful lot of money
 
01:28:10.149 --> 01:28:10.159 align:start position:0%
and because these fares
 
01:28:12.790 --> 01:28:12.800 align:start position:0%
are i would say regional in nature and
 
01:28:14.470 --> 01:28:14.480 align:start position:0%
they're generating
 
01:28:17.430 --> 01:28:17.440 align:start position:0%
economic development for those regions
 
01:28:20.070 --> 01:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
and we have an economic development
 
01:28:20.080 --> 01:28:21.030 align:start position:0%
and we have an economic development
person

01:28:21.030 --> 01:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
person
 
01:28:24.070 --> 01:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
i believe in each county
 
01:28:26.550 --> 01:28:26.560 align:start position:0%
through the unh extension
 
01:28:28.709 --> 01:28:28.719 align:start position:0%
and their job is to help small
 
01:28:32.950 --> 01:28:32.960 align:start position:0%
communities um develop economically
 
01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:34.229 align:start position:0%
communities um develop economically
why

01:28:34.229 --> 01:28:34.239 align:start position:0%
why
 
01:28:37.830 --> 01:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
or how involved are the towns
 
01:28:39.669 --> 01:28:39.679 align:start position:0%
in funding
 
01:28:42.470 --> 01:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
the maintenance of these buildings and
 
01:28:45.910 --> 01:28:45.920 align:start position:0%
and if not why not since it's generating
 
01:28:48.550 --> 01:28:48.560 align:start position:0%
economic development
 
01:28:50.870 --> 01:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
well i i think
 
01:28:53.189 --> 01:28:53.199 align:start position:0%
that's a question that i don't have the
 
01:28:55.430 --> 01:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
answer to except to say that i am not
 
01:28:58.470 --> 01:28:58.480 align:start position:0%
aware of any local community supporting
 
01:29:02.229 --> 01:29:02.239 align:start position:0%
any of these these non-profits
 
01:29:04.870 --> 01:29:04.880 align:start position:0%
that probably gets into a very slippery
 
01:29:06.229 --> 01:29:06.239 align:start position:0%
slope and you could ask the same
 
01:29:08.310 --> 01:29:08.320 align:start position:0%
question about why
 
01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:09.270 align:start position:0%
question about why
wouldn't

01:29:09.270 --> 01:29:09.280 align:start position:0%
wouldn't
 
01:29:10.709 --> 01:29:10.719 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire then be
 
01:29:13.350 --> 01:29:13.360 align:start position:0%
supporting the maintenance of
 
01:29:17.669 --> 01:29:17.679 align:start position:0%
the kiwanis building or the lions hall
 
01:29:19.350 --> 01:29:19.360 align:start position:0%
um and i think
 
01:29:22.310 --> 01:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
that my answer to that is because that
 
01:29:24.470 --> 01:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
those organizations
 
01:29:27.030 --> 01:29:27.040 align:start position:0%
serve are there to serve their
 
01:29:31.189 --> 01:29:31.199 align:start position:0%
communities they fundraise to provide
 
01:29:34.550 --> 01:29:34.560 align:start position:0%
money for those those organizations and
 
01:29:37.430 --> 01:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
and themselves in this case these
 
01:29:39.990 --> 01:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
these and they are able to fundraise and
 
01:29:42.790 --> 01:29:42.800 align:start position:0%
operate year round these these fares are
 
01:29:42.800 --> 01:29:44.709 align:start position:0%
operate year round these these fares are
eliminated

01:29:44.709 --> 01:29:44.719 align:start position:0%
eliminated
 
01:29:44.719 --> 01:29:45.590 align:start position:0%
eliminated
are

01:29:45.590 --> 01:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:29:49.430 --> 01:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
operating three to maybe 14 days
 
01:29:52.149 --> 01:29:52.159 align:start position:0%
a year and then they have to do other
 
01:29:54.310 --> 01:29:54.320 align:start position:0%
things to try to support themselves and
 
01:29:56.629 --> 01:29:56.639 align:start position:0%
i think it's the unique nature of
 
01:29:59.270 --> 01:29:59.280 align:start position:0%
agriculture in the history that that the
 
01:30:02.310 --> 01:30:02.320 align:start position:0%
state does have a history of supporting
 
01:30:04.070 --> 01:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
our fares in the state of new hampshire
 
01:30:06.149 --> 01:30:06.159 align:start position:0%
representative bolton
 
01:30:07.510 --> 01:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry my question's been answered
 
01:30:11.030 --> 01:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
thank you okay uh representative kennedy
 
01:30:13.910 --> 01:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mine is um
 
01:30:15.750 --> 01:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
referring back to policy and why we're
 
01:30:17.669 --> 01:30:17.679 align:start position:0%
here we're here because we want to
 
01:30:20.390 --> 01:30:20.400 align:start position:0%
reflect that this bill is good policy
 
01:30:22.870 --> 01:30:22.880 align:start position:0%
and that is designed correctly to go to
 
01:30:24.790 --> 01:30:24.800 align:start position:0%
finance which
 
01:30:26.870 --> 01:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
in my personal opinion it is
 
01:30:29.189 --> 01:30:29.199 align:start position:0%
over the past 20 years
 
01:30:31.110 --> 01:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
showing at all these fairs
 
01:30:32.830 --> 01:30:32.840 align:start position:0%
during the pharisees and off the fair
 
01:30:36.390 --> 01:30:36.400 align:start position:0%
season i have seen the degrade
 
01:30:39.430 --> 01:30:39.440 align:start position:0%
and value of a lot of the buildings
 
01:30:41.830 --> 01:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
there's only so much fundraising and we
 
01:30:43.750 --> 01:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
heard this all in the testimony that
 
01:30:43.760 --> 01:30:45.110 align:start position:0%
heard this all in the testimony that
happened

01:30:45.110 --> 01:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
happened
 
01:30:46.470 --> 01:30:46.480 align:start position:0%
in front of us
 
01:30:48.950 --> 01:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
last week and
 
01:30:51.350 --> 01:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
you look at sandwich hopkinton new
 
01:30:53.669 --> 01:30:53.679 align:start position:0%
boston hillsborough county fair
 
01:30:55.990 --> 01:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
grafton they all have been doing that
 
01:30:57.510 --> 01:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
local fundraising they've been working
 
01:30:59.030 --> 01:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
their butt off i know a lot of the
 
01:31:02.229 --> 01:31:02.239 align:start position:0%
people on those types of boards and this
 
01:31:04.149 --> 01:31:04.159 align:start position:0%
is going to help them
 
01:31:06.390 --> 01:31:06.400 align:start position:0%
be able to grow because in the off
 
01:31:08.629 --> 01:31:08.639 align:start position:0%
season which you just mentioned
 
01:31:11.350 --> 01:31:11.360 align:start position:0%
they've rent that out to 4-h those
 
01:31:13.910 --> 01:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
4-hours are paying premium costs to be
 
01:31:16.149 --> 01:31:16.159 align:start position:0%
able to rent out that facility to show
 
01:31:18.070 --> 01:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
their animals so they can make it to
 
01:31:19.910 --> 01:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
biggie so they can make it to all the
 
01:31:21.750 --> 01:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
regional affairs
 
01:31:23.350 --> 01:31:23.360 align:start position:0%
our job is to make sure that this is
 
01:31:25.910 --> 01:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
good policy so it can go to finance so
 
01:31:28.470 --> 01:31:28.480 align:start position:0%
it can get approved so we can let those
 
01:31:32.709 --> 01:31:32.719 align:start position:0%
4-hrs continue to grow
 
01:31:35.110 --> 01:31:35.120 align:start position:0%
i'm emotional because it's very close to
 
01:31:37.510 --> 01:31:37.520 align:start position:0%
my heart but
 
01:31:38.629 --> 01:31:38.639 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:31:40.310 --> 01:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative kennedy and
 
01:31:41.750 --> 01:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
if i may
 
01:31:43.430 --> 01:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
to your point
 
01:31:46.629 --> 01:31:46.639 align:start position:0%
new boston which was primarily a 4-h
 
01:31:46.639 --> 01:31:47.990 align:start position:0%
new boston which was primarily a 4-h
fair

01:31:47.990 --> 01:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
fair
 
01:31:50.790 --> 01:31:50.800 align:start position:0%
because of the economic situation
 
01:31:52.790 --> 01:31:52.800 align:start position:0%
there their board of directors has moved
 
01:31:56.149 --> 01:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
in a direction of looking strictly at
 
01:31:58.790 --> 01:31:58.800 align:start position:0%
what's the income best income stream and
 
01:32:01.590 --> 01:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
to a large degree 4-h is being pushed
 
01:32:03.910 --> 01:32:03.920 align:start position:0%
out of those fairgrounds
 
01:32:05.590 --> 01:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
during the year
 
01:32:07.830 --> 01:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
because of the fact that they have to
 
01:32:09.910 --> 01:32:09.920 align:start position:0%
make these these choices to maintain
 
01:32:11.750 --> 01:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
what they have there
 
01:32:13.189 --> 01:32:13.199 align:start position:0%
and hopefully this would help and these
 
01:32:15.350 --> 01:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
would be the considerations
 
01:32:15.360 --> 01:32:16.149 align:start position:0%
would be the considerations
that

01:32:16.149 --> 01:32:16.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:32:18.310 --> 01:32:18.320 align:start position:0%
i would look at and i would anticipate
 
01:32:19.990 --> 01:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
in putting into rules what are the
 
01:32:23.110 --> 01:32:23.120 align:start position:0%
off-season usage for things like like
 
01:32:24.950 --> 01:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
that and certainly that would be a
 
01:32:27.350 --> 01:32:27.360 align:start position:0%
priority because these these
 
01:32:30.950 --> 01:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
4-h need the opportunity to be able to
 
01:32:32.709 --> 01:32:32.719 align:start position:0%
learn in the proper environment how to
 
01:32:34.310 --> 01:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
show their animals and how to do the
 
01:32:36.470 --> 01:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
things that they need to and if the
 
01:32:38.390 --> 01:32:38.400 align:start position:0%
fairgrounds are saying well they're not
 
01:32:39.750 --> 01:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
there because we're going to put boats
 
01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:40.470 align:start position:0%
there because we're going to put boats
and

01:32:40.470 --> 01:32:40.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:32:42.149 --> 01:32:42.159 align:start position:0%
you know in
 
01:32:43.510 --> 01:32:43.520 align:start position:0%
in other things in storage and the
 
01:32:45.590 --> 01:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
buildings aren't going to be used that
 
01:32:47.350 --> 01:32:47.360 align:start position:0%
that would need to be a factor because
 
01:32:50.229 --> 01:32:50.239 align:start position:0%
the 4-h is is very very important and i
 
01:32:52.550 --> 01:32:52.560 align:start position:0%
think you see in the bill that
 
01:32:53.350 --> 01:32:53.360 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:32:56.709 --> 01:32:56.719 align:start position:0%
4-h and ffa are are important
 
01:32:56.719 --> 01:32:58.790 align:start position:0%
4-h and ffa are are important
requirements

01:32:58.790 --> 01:32:58.800 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
01:33:01.350 --> 01:33:01.360 align:start position:0%
to receive funding through this through
 
01:33:03.669 --> 01:33:03.679 align:start position:0%
this build
 
01:33:06.310 --> 01:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
representative mason
 
01:33:08.229 --> 01:33:08.239 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:33:10.550 --> 01:33:10.560 align:start position:0%
commissioner could you tell me uh
 
01:33:12.149 --> 01:33:12.159 align:start position:0%
one question the
 
01:33:13.830 --> 01:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
capital improvement would also include
 
01:33:15.669 --> 01:33:15.679 align:start position:0%
items like bringing
 
01:33:18.550 --> 01:33:18.560 align:start position:0%
power services up to grade
 
01:33:20.390 --> 01:33:20.400 align:start position:0%
bringing up
 
01:33:22.870 --> 01:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
septic systems up to grade a lot of new
 
01:33:24.550 --> 01:33:24.560 align:start position:0%
regulatory issues that have come down
 
01:33:26.229 --> 01:33:26.239 align:start position:0%
the line that
 
01:33:28.149 --> 01:33:28.159 align:start position:0%
this legislature has passed is being
 
01:33:29.510 --> 01:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
forced on
 
01:33:31.590 --> 01:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
uh these fair associations to do a lot
 
01:33:33.189 --> 01:33:33.199 align:start position:0%
of modifications
 
01:33:35.430 --> 01:33:35.440 align:start position:0%
and improve your facility to try to
 
01:33:36.390 --> 01:33:36.400 align:start position:0%
bring them up
 
01:33:39.669 --> 01:33:39.679 align:start position:0%
to a quality standard that currently is
 
01:33:41.669 --> 01:33:41.679 align:start position:0%
not acceptable i know back when we were
 
01:33:43.270 --> 01:33:43.280 align:start position:0%
young it was a lot different than it is
 
01:33:43.280 --> 01:33:44.229 align:start position:0%
young it was a lot different than it is
today

01:33:44.229 --> 01:33:44.239 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:33:46.149 --> 01:33:46.159 align:start position:0%
but um i know that's put a lot of
 
01:33:47.510 --> 01:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
pressure would that money be available
 
01:33:49.590 --> 01:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
for those types of capital improvements
 
01:33:51.270 --> 01:33:51.280 align:start position:0%
as well
 
01:33:53.350 --> 01:33:53.360 align:start position:0%
my reading of the bill and how i would
 
01:33:55.030 --> 01:33:55.040 align:start position:0%
intend to
 
01:33:57.430 --> 01:33:57.440 align:start position:0%
put the rules in place would be that any
 
01:33:59.750 --> 01:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
of the infrastructure needs related to
 
01:34:01.270 --> 01:34:01.280 align:start position:0%
the agricultural
 
01:34:02.950 --> 01:34:02.960 align:start position:0%
portions of the fair would be eligible
 
01:34:04.870 --> 01:34:04.880 align:start position:0%
and i touched on that a little bit in
 
01:34:07.430 --> 01:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
terms of fire regulations but obviously
 
01:34:10.709 --> 01:34:10.719 align:start position:0%
you know septic and in electrical would
 
01:34:13.110 --> 01:34:13.120 align:start position:0%
be part of that because ultimately if
 
01:34:15.110 --> 01:34:15.120 align:start position:0%
you know the fire department or the town
 
01:34:17.750 --> 01:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
comes in whoever is doing
 
01:34:19.350 --> 01:34:19.360 align:start position:0%
that is going to come in and look and
 
01:34:21.990 --> 01:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
say your your facilities are not
 
01:34:23.189 --> 01:34:23.199 align:start position:0%
adequate we're going to shut the
 
01:34:25.270 --> 01:34:25.280 align:start position:0%
building down that's got to be part of
 
01:34:25.280 --> 01:34:26.229 align:start position:0%
building down that's got to be part of
it

01:34:26.229 --> 01:34:26.239 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:34:27.750 --> 01:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:34:29.669 --> 01:34:29.679 align:start position:0%
follow up go ahead
 
01:34:31.669 --> 01:34:31.679 align:start position:0%
so when we go to some of these fares we
 
01:34:33.189 --> 01:34:33.199 align:start position:0%
see some that have very large gate
 
01:34:35.270 --> 01:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
attendances like
 
01:34:37.669 --> 01:34:37.679 align:start position:0%
dear field fair look at deerfield very
 
01:34:39.430 --> 01:34:39.440 align:start position:0%
large gated attendance uh deerfield fair
 
01:34:41.830 --> 01:34:41.840 align:start position:0%
produces a lot of money but we go to it
 
01:34:44.310 --> 01:34:44.320 align:start position:0%
is belknap fair still active
 
01:34:47.590 --> 01:34:47.600 align:start position:0%
it is it's just i think gone through an
 
01:34:49.830 --> 01:34:49.840 align:start position:0%
uh an ownership
 
01:34:49.840 --> 01:34:51.270 align:start position:0%
uh an ownership
change

01:34:51.270 --> 01:34:51.280 align:start position:0%
change
 
01:34:53.830 --> 01:34:53.840 align:start position:0%
um it was owned i think by 4-h i don't
 
01:34:53.840 --> 01:34:54.550 align:start position:0%
um it was owned i think by 4-h i don't
think

01:34:54.550 --> 01:34:54.560 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:34:57.430 --> 01:34:57.440 align:start position:0%
4-h owns it anymore now it's owned by
 
01:35:00.470 --> 01:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
okay another organization but it's
 
01:35:02.629 --> 01:35:02.639 align:start position:0%
primarily 4-h but as we come to some of
 
01:35:04.550 --> 01:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
these small affairs they run under a
 
01:35:05.910 --> 01:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
whole different
 
01:35:08.070 --> 01:35:08.080 align:start position:0%
budget restriction and they just don't
 
01:35:09.990 --> 01:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
have the funds available to do any of
 
01:35:12.790 --> 01:35:12.800 align:start position:0%
these changes so
 
01:35:15.189 --> 01:35:15.199 align:start position:0%
you would put together
 
01:35:17.510 --> 01:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
a group within your system that would
 
01:35:19.510 --> 01:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
within your um
 
01:35:21.750 --> 01:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
office that would manage these funds so
 
01:35:23.750 --> 01:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
those would be more available to the
 
01:35:27.109 --> 01:35:27.119 align:start position:0%
organization they would have to put in
 
01:35:29.270 --> 01:35:29.280 align:start position:0%
a an application for the funds with the
 
01:35:29.280 --> 01:35:30.470 align:start position:0%
a an application for the funds with the
detail

01:35:30.470 --> 01:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
detail
 
01:35:33.030 --> 01:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
of what it is there
 
01:35:34.870 --> 01:35:34.880 align:start position:0%
they need and
 
01:35:36.229 --> 01:35:36.239 align:start position:0%
how they're going to expend them and
 
01:35:37.910 --> 01:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
then we would review those applications
 
01:35:40.950 --> 01:35:40.960 align:start position:0%
i say i can't on any basis on an as
 
01:35:43.109 --> 01:35:43.119 align:start position:0%
needed basis and so you know there will
 
01:35:45.189 --> 01:35:45.199 align:start position:0%
be people that will be very unhappy i'm
 
01:35:45.199 --> 01:35:46.390 align:start position:0%
be people that will be very unhappy i'm
sure

01:35:46.390 --> 01:35:46.400 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:35:47.669 --> 01:35:47.679 align:start position:0%
because at some point you're going to
 
01:35:49.669 --> 01:35:49.679 align:start position:0%
say well look look how much money went
 
01:35:52.870 --> 01:35:52.880 align:start position:0%
to belknap fare for instance this year
 
01:35:54.550 --> 01:35:54.560 align:start position:0%
but it's going to be based on on those
 
01:35:57.270 --> 01:35:57.280 align:start position:0%
needs where you know i i
 
01:35:59.510 --> 01:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
love deerfield fair i go there every
 
01:36:02.229 --> 01:36:02.239 align:start position:0%
year that's always been my favorite fare
 
01:36:05.109 --> 01:36:05.119 align:start position:0%
i don't see that they would be getting
 
01:36:08.229 --> 01:36:08.239 align:start position:0%
a proportional amount of of this money
 
01:36:10.550 --> 01:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
because they are probably the healthiest
 
01:36:13.590 --> 01:36:13.600 align:start position:0%
fare they have so many other activities
 
01:36:15.270 --> 01:36:15.280 align:start position:0%
that they're bringing in money you know
 
01:36:17.669 --> 01:36:17.679 align:start position:0%
with their horse arenas that those
 
01:36:19.750 --> 01:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
things they're always able to bring in
 
01:36:22.229 --> 01:36:22.239 align:start position:0%
other money where bell now probably
 
01:36:25.270 --> 01:36:25.280 align:start position:0%
isn't but yet it's an important fair to
 
01:36:27.350 --> 01:36:27.360 align:start position:0%
that region and i don't want to see any
 
01:36:28.550 --> 01:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
any fairs
 
01:36:31.030 --> 01:36:31.040 align:start position:0%
go under yet this this can't be a fund
 
01:36:33.510 --> 01:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
that okay we're just gonna support
 
01:36:36.390 --> 01:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
belknap every year after year after year
 
01:36:38.470 --> 01:36:38.480 align:start position:0%
um there's there's a balance here but
 
01:36:40.950 --> 01:36:40.960 align:start position:0%
they're probably early on this program
 
01:36:42.870 --> 01:36:42.880 align:start position:0%
you're probably going to see some of the
 
01:36:45.350 --> 01:36:45.360 align:start position:0%
the smaller fares get the lion's
 
01:36:48.310 --> 01:36:48.320 align:start position:0%
share of the money early on to make sure
 
01:36:51.109 --> 01:36:51.119 align:start position:0%
that they don't go under
 
01:36:55.350 --> 01:36:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:56.790 --> 01:36:56.800 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner we appreciate
 
01:36:58.870 --> 01:36:58.880 align:start position:0%
your time thank you i appreciate you
 
01:37:01.910 --> 01:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:04.149 --> 01:37:04.159 align:start position:0%
so this is an early bill we're going to
 
01:37:06.629 --> 01:37:06.639 align:start position:0%
have to exec on it today representative
 
01:37:08.870 --> 01:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
bixby i actually have a question for
 
01:37:10.550 --> 01:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
representative compton
 
01:37:12.229 --> 01:37:12.239 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that you had some other
 
01:37:13.910 --> 01:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
idea for funding rather than general
 
01:37:15.990 --> 01:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
fund could you explain
 
01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:17.270 align:start position:0%
fund could you explain
um

01:37:17.270 --> 01:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:20.149 --> 01:37:20.159 align:start position:0%
thank you representative so in when we
 
01:37:21.910 --> 01:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
were discussing this bill
 
01:37:24.550 --> 01:37:24.560 align:start position:0%
i was looking at why couldn't because
 
01:37:24.560 --> 01:37:25.669 align:start position:0%
i was looking at why couldn't because
originally

01:37:25.669 --> 01:37:25.679 align:start position:0%
originally
 
01:37:28.149 --> 01:37:28.159 align:start position:0%
this came from the um
 
01:37:30.390 --> 01:37:30.400 align:start position:0%
the race track down in rockingham park
 
01:37:31.350 --> 01:37:31.360 align:start position:0%
is how
 
01:37:32.870 --> 01:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
uh this
 
01:37:34.629 --> 01:37:34.639 align:start position:0%
uh these capital improvements were
 
01:37:37.669 --> 01:37:37.679 align:start position:0%
funded uh or the state fairs were funded
 
01:37:39.189 --> 01:37:39.199 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:37:41.590 --> 01:37:41.600 align:start position:0%
i was wondering why we couldn't take a
 
01:37:44.310 --> 01:37:44.320 align:start position:0%
look at the historic horse racing which
 
01:37:46.390 --> 01:37:46.400 align:start position:0%
is very similar to how
 
01:37:48.550 --> 01:37:48.560 align:start position:0%
you know it's the same venue basically
 
01:37:50.470 --> 01:37:50.480 align:start position:0%
of how these state fairs were funded
 
01:37:53.109 --> 01:37:53.119 align:start position:0%
previously and why couldn't it be funded
 
01:37:54.950 --> 01:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
that way um
 
01:37:57.030 --> 01:37:57.040 align:start position:0%
but as i understand we are just a policy
 
01:37:58.470 --> 01:37:58.480 align:start position:0%
committee and we would actually have to
 
01:38:00.830 --> 01:38:00.840 align:start position:0%
leave the funding to
 
01:38:03.430 --> 01:38:03.440 align:start position:0%
finance thank you
 
01:38:05.109 --> 01:38:05.119 align:start position:0%
i think that would be a wise choice
 
01:38:06.709 --> 01:38:06.719 align:start position:0%
since they have a lot more expertise and
 
01:38:08.229 --> 01:38:08.239 align:start position:0%
knowledge in
 
01:38:11.189 --> 01:38:11.199 align:start position:0%
that area than we do here
 
01:38:13.910 --> 01:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
any uh further thoughts before we come
 
01:38:16.070 --> 01:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
out of work session and go into exact
 
01:38:16.080 --> 01:38:18.390 align:start position:0%
out of work session and go into exact
session

01:38:18.390 --> 01:38:18.400 align:start position:0%
session
 
01:38:18.400 --> 01:38:20.229 align:start position:0%
session
yes

01:38:20.229 --> 01:38:20.239 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:38:23.109 --> 01:38:23.119 align:start position:0%
secured yes uh so
 
01:38:25.189 --> 01:38:25.199 align:start position:0%
we have to execute this today is that
 
01:38:26.310 --> 01:38:26.320 align:start position:0%
what i understand because if it's
 
01:38:28.950 --> 01:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
because it's an early bill
 
01:38:30.709 --> 01:38:30.719 align:start position:0%
i'm going to run up against the deadline
 
01:38:32.629 --> 01:38:32.639 align:start position:0%
i'd like to execute today i think i
 
01:38:34.870 --> 01:38:34.880 align:start position:0%
could push it a few more days but i i'm
 
01:38:36.390 --> 01:38:36.400 align:start position:0%
not sure that we'd
 
01:38:37.910 --> 01:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
i do you have an idea that might change
 
01:38:39.669 --> 01:38:39.679 align:start position:0%
some of the committee members minds
 
01:38:42.070 --> 01:38:42.080 align:start position:0%
it's not this just be
 
01:38:43.350 --> 01:38:43.360 align:start position:0%
my personal feelings i'm having a hard
 
01:38:45.669 --> 01:38:45.679 align:start position:0%
time with this bill uh i like the idea
 
01:38:46.870 --> 01:38:46.880 align:start position:0%
of supporting agriculture but there's
 
01:38:48.070 --> 01:38:48.080 align:start position:0%
some other parts of it that i would like
 
01:38:49.270 --> 01:38:49.280 align:start position:0%
to think through
 
01:38:50.550 --> 01:38:50.560 align:start position:0%
i understand if we have to move it
 
01:38:51.750 --> 01:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
forward that's fine but if we're going
 
01:38:54.070 --> 01:38:54.080 align:start position:0%
to meet again next week anyway
 
01:38:55.750 --> 01:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
and it's possible to push it to that
 
01:38:57.910 --> 01:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
point then i would appreciate it but i
 
01:38:59.830 --> 01:38:59.840 align:start position:0%
also understand if we have to go forward
 
01:39:03.189 --> 01:39:03.199 align:start position:0%
today let me just check and make sure
 
01:39:07.910 --> 01:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:10.870 --> 01:39:10.880 align:start position:0%
mr chairman it's the 17th
 
01:39:13.590 --> 01:39:13.600 align:start position:0%
yeah but the speaker gave us a date of
 
01:39:16.070 --> 01:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
the 10th because he's moving it forward
 
01:39:16.080 --> 01:39:16.950 align:start position:0%
the 10th because he's moving it forward
so

01:39:16.950 --> 01:39:16.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:39:19.510 --> 01:39:19.520 align:start position:0%
we could push it till next week um the
 
01:39:25.350 --> 01:39:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:27.990 --> 01:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
so what i'm looking at is
 
01:39:29.270 --> 01:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
here's my concern
 
01:39:31.109 --> 01:39:31.119 align:start position:0%
hold on one second representative i'm
 
01:39:32.470 --> 01:39:32.480 align:start position:0%
considering putting both of the
 
01:39:34.229 --> 01:39:34.239 align:start position:0%
remaining bills we would have beyond
 
01:39:36.470 --> 01:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
this into subcommittees
 
01:39:37.990 --> 01:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
and so we wouldn't have the full
 
01:39:41.750 --> 01:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
committee assembled next week and if i
 
01:39:44.070 --> 01:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
push this off then i'm going to have to
 
01:39:45.990 --> 01:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
require that the full committee come in
 
01:39:47.669 --> 01:39:47.679 align:start position:0%
that that was all i was trying to be
 
01:39:49.189 --> 01:39:49.199 align:start position:0%
respectful of everyone's time while we
 
01:39:50.550 --> 01:39:50.560 align:start position:0%
were all here
 
01:39:52.629 --> 01:39:52.639 align:start position:0%
and so the the two if we exact the
 
01:39:54.390 --> 01:39:54.400 align:start position:0%
things that i had
 
01:39:56.070 --> 01:39:56.080 align:start position:0%
planned on executing today we'd have two
 
01:39:58.149 --> 01:39:58.159 align:start position:0%
bills remaining which i was going to put
 
01:39:59.750 --> 01:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
into subcommittees
 
01:40:02.070 --> 01:40:02.080 align:start position:0%
it was kind of my thought but i'm
 
01:40:03.590 --> 01:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
certainly open if it's the will of the
 
01:40:04.950 --> 01:40:04.960 align:start position:0%
committee to push this off and you all
 
01:40:07.189 --> 01:40:07.199 align:start position:0%
want to come in next week i can do it by
 
01:40:07.199 --> 01:40:10.149 align:start position:0%
want to come in next week i can do it by
deadline

01:40:10.149 --> 01:40:10.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:12.070 --> 01:40:12.080 align:start position:0%
representative perez
 
01:40:13.910 --> 01:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
i feel the same way i'm having a hard
 
01:40:17.109 --> 01:40:17.119 align:start position:0%
time with this bill so i
 
01:40:19.270 --> 01:40:19.280 align:start position:0%
i have a lot of thoughts and i need to
 
01:40:19.280 --> 01:40:21.430 align:start position:0%
i have a lot of thoughts and i need to
like

01:40:21.430 --> 01:40:21.440 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:40:23.189 --> 01:40:23.199 align:start position:0%
if i gave you a 15-minute break would
 
01:40:24.550 --> 01:40:24.560 align:start position:0%
you have an opportunity to think about
 
01:40:25.590 --> 01:40:25.600 align:start position:0%
it because i do have to get a little bit
 
01:40:27.109 --> 01:40:27.119 align:start position:0%
of paperwork before i go into exact
 
01:40:27.119 --> 01:40:28.950 align:start position:0%
of paperwork before i go into exact
session

01:40:28.950 --> 01:40:28.960 align:start position:0%
session
 
01:40:30.790 --> 01:40:30.800 align:start position:0%
that's certainly fine here i
 
01:40:32.629 --> 01:40:32.639 align:start position:0%
would happy time and a few to
 
01:40:34.629 --> 01:40:34.639 align:start position:0%
get any clarification you need yeah to
 
01:40:36.550 --> 01:40:36.560 align:start position:0%
be honest i
 
01:40:39.510 --> 01:40:39.520 align:start position:0%
i get it but in the same way i'm very
 
01:40:41.750 --> 01:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
concerned about
 
01:40:43.510 --> 01:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
money is only going to a certain fair
 
01:40:45.910 --> 01:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
more money is going to certain
 
01:40:48.629 --> 01:40:48.639 align:start position:0%
areas in the state and not the others
 
01:40:51.750 --> 01:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:40:52.950 --> 01:40:52.960 align:start position:0%
for that reason
 
01:40:52.960 --> 01:40:54.550 align:start position:0%
for that reason
my

01:40:54.550 --> 01:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
my
 
01:40:57.430 --> 01:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
my heart is divided which way to go so i
 
01:40:59.109 --> 01:40:59.119 align:start position:0%
will remind you that this is a second
 
01:41:00.229 --> 01:41:00.239 align:start position:0%
committee bill
 
01:41:02.310 --> 01:41:02.320 align:start position:0%
you'll have an opportunity it's assuming
 
01:41:04.310 --> 01:41:04.320 align:start position:0%
it passes here in the house floor you'd
 
01:41:05.669 --> 01:41:05.679 align:start position:0%
have an opportunity to give further
 
01:41:08.390 --> 01:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
testimony in finance where they might be
 
01:41:10.550 --> 01:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
more able to address your concerns
 
01:41:12.709 --> 01:41:12.719 align:start position:0%
properly about how the the allocation of
 
01:41:14.550 --> 01:41:14.560 align:start position:0%
the funds would go more so than we as
 
01:41:16.470 --> 01:41:16.480 align:start position:0%
the policy committee would be
 
01:41:20.229 --> 01:41:20.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:21.910 --> 01:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
okay i'm going to take about a 10-minute
 
01:41:23.189 --> 01:41:23.199 align:start position:0%
break here because i've got a little bit
 
01:41:24.790 --> 01:41:24.800 align:start position:0%
of paperwork i have to
 
01:41:26.790 --> 01:41:26.800 align:start position:0%
retrieve before we go into exec sessions
 
01:41:28.070 --> 01:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
so we'll um
 
01:41:30.550 --> 01:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
we'll come back into exec session at 11
 
01:41:30.560 --> 01:42:41.830 align:start position:0%
we'll come back into exec session at 11
50.

01:42:41.830 --> 01:42:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:41.840 --> 01:45:57.830 align:start position:0%
 
it

01:45:57.830 --> 01:45:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:57.840 --> 01:47:07.830 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:47:07.830 --> 01:47:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:07.840 --> 01:50:09.830 align:start position:0%
 
it

01:50:09.830 --> 01:50:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:09.840 --> 01:56:35.430 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:56:35.430 --> 01:56:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:38.629 --> 01:56:38.639 align:start position:0%
okay we're going to open up the exec
 
01:56:41.109 --> 01:56:41.119 align:start position:0%
session and we have quite a few bills to
 
01:56:43.510 --> 01:56:43.520 align:start position:0%
go through here so we're going to
 
01:56:49.270 --> 01:56:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:50.550 --> 01:56:50.560 align:start position:0%
we will
 
01:56:54.070 --> 01:56:54.080 align:start position:0%
start with house bill 1111 and i will
 
01:56:56.470 --> 01:56:56.480 align:start position:0%
look to representative dutsy for an is
 
01:56:56.480 --> 01:57:01.990 align:start position:0%
look to representative dutsy for an is
motion

01:57:01.990 --> 01:57:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:07.669 --> 01:57:07.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:17.350 --> 01:57:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:18.629 --> 01:57:18.639 align:start position:0%
representative bixby would you like to
 
01:57:22.229 --> 01:57:22.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:22.239 --> 01:57:23.109 align:start position:0%
 
sure

01:57:23.109 --> 01:57:23.119 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:57:25.669 --> 01:57:25.679 align:start position:0%
um so uh
 
01:57:28.790 --> 01:57:28.800 align:start position:0%
i move uh interim study on uh
 
01:57:32.149 --> 01:57:32.159 align:start position:0%
hb 1111 and representative control for a
 
01:57:35.430 --> 01:57:35.440 align:start position:0%
second yes i a second uh interim study
 
01:57:37.990 --> 01:57:38.000 align:start position:0%
on hb111
 
01:57:40.070 --> 01:57:40.080 align:start position:0%
so we have a motion for interim study on
 
01:57:42.390 --> 01:57:42.400 align:start position:0%

on uh hb 1134 and i'm looking to
 
02:02:49.830 --> 02:02:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:51.990 --> 02:02:52.000 align:start position:0%
i second that representative bixby would
 
02:02:53.910 --> 02:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
you like to speak to your motion
 
02:02:56.149 --> 02:02:56.159 align:start position:0%
yes so um
 
02:03:00.629 --> 02:03:00.639 align:start position:0%
this bill came to us uh and it was um
 
02:03:03.350 --> 02:03:03.360 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of strong testimony in
 
02:03:05.270 --> 02:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
favor of making a study commission on
 
02:03:05.280 --> 02:03:06.149 align:start position:0%
favor of making a study commission on
this

02:03:06.149 --> 02:03:06.159 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:03:09.750 --> 02:03:09.760 align:start position:0%
uh but this is an area that um we
 
02:03:11.830 --> 02:03:11.840 align:start position:0%
actually don't know that much about on
 
02:03:15.430 --> 02:03:15.440 align:start position:0%
our committee and we've arranged to
 
02:03:18.229 --> 02:03:18.239 align:start position:0%
have this go to uh resources as a second
 
02:03:18.239 --> 02:03:19.270 align:start position:0%
have this go to uh resources as a second
committee

02:03:19.270 --> 02:03:19.280 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:03:19.280 --> 02:03:20.070 align:start position:0%
committee
so

02:03:20.070 --> 02:03:20.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:03:21.910 --> 02:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
we made a couple of amendments to just
 
02:03:24.229 --> 02:03:24.239 align:start position:0%
clarify that this was more in their
 
02:03:25.910 --> 02:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
bailiwick than ours
 
02:03:27.910 --> 02:03:27.920 align:start position:0%
and that it be a committee rather than a
 
02:03:27.920 --> 02:03:29.030 align:start position:0%
and that it be a committee rather than a
commission

02:03:29.030 --> 02:03:29.040 align:start position:0%
commission
 
02:03:31.270 --> 02:03:31.280 align:start position:0%
uh so um
 
02:03:33.589 --> 02:03:33.599 align:start position:0%
the uh the intent here is to make sure
 
02:03:35.910 --> 02:03:35.920 align:start position:0%
that this does get studied because the
 
02:03:38.070 --> 02:03:38.080 align:start position:0%
disposable wipes uh
 
02:03:41.430 --> 02:03:41.440 align:start position:0%
do cause uh significant damage to

that to clarify that it's just landfills
 
02:07:51.830 --> 02:07:51.840 align:start position:0%

a bottle redemption plan as a way to

reduce flow to the landfills we saw some
 
02:12:53.510 --> 02:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
evidence that it uh in states where it
 
02:12:55.430 --> 02:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
is used they have a much higher
 
02:12:58.629 --> 02:12:58.639 align:start position:0%
diversion of recyclables however
 
02:13:02.069 --> 02:13:02.079 align:start position:0%
the bill that was proposed had enough

amendable in this uh in the time frame
 
02:13:08.229 --> 02:13:08.239 align:start position:0%
for this year
 
02:13:10.149 --> 02:13:10.159 align:start position:0%
and we also want to look at it in the
 
02:13:12.629 --> 02:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
context of other mechanisms for
 
02:13:12.639 --> 02:13:14.229 align:start position:0%

this is a chapter of law that uh has not

been studied in a long time and there
 
02:15:19.189 --> 02:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
are we noted some flaws in it uh having

when we visited it for
 
02:15:24.629 --> 02:15:24.639 align:start position:0%
the purposes of other legislation recent

we decided we could put this on consent
 
02:21:13.349 --> 02:21:13.359 align:start position:0%
because the
 
02:21:15.590 --> 02:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
fiscal note is zero dollars so everybody
 
02:21:17.429 --> 02:21:17.439 align:start position:0%
okay with that
 
02:21:22.710 --> 02:21:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:25.429 --> 02:21:25.439 align:start position:0%

02:21:29.510 --> 02:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
again to representative aaron for the
 
02:21:32.870 --> 02:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:35.110 --> 02:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
02:21:37.510 --> 02:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
so i'd like to present
 
02:21:40.870 --> 02:21:40.880 align:start position:0%
the amendment to house bill 1187 which
 
02:21:45.190 --> 02:21:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:46.790 --> 02:21:46.800 align:start position:0%
and representative bixby did you want a
 
02:21:46.800 --> 02:21:47.670 align:start position:0%
and representative bixby did you want a
second

02:21:47.670 --> 02:21:47.680 align:start position:0%
second
 
02:21:49.830 --> 02:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
i second that we have a motion and a
 
02:21:52.150 --> 02:21:52.160 align:start position:0%
second for amendment 03408
 
02:21:53.510 --> 02:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
representative aaron you're recognized
 
02:21:55.670 --> 02:21:55.680 align:start position:0%
to speak to your motion
 
02:21:57.990 --> 02:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
thank you again mr chair
 
02:22:01.030 --> 02:22:01.040 align:start position:0%
so this amendment basically
 
02:22:05.110 --> 02:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
adds the section that was accepted
 
02:22:08.550 --> 02:22:08.560 align:start position:0%
by the senate to a current bill that is
 
02:22:11.670 --> 02:22:11.680 align:start position:0%
being considered house bill 95
 
02:22:11.680 --> 02:22:12.389 align:start position:0%
being considered house bill 95
so

02:22:12.389 --> 02:22:12.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:22:14.710 --> 02:22:14.720 align:start position:0%
it essentially makes this bill the same
 
02:22:18.070 --> 02:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:20.309 --> 02:22:20.319 align:start position:0%
and i would just like to add that
 
02:22:22.070 --> 02:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
while this may seem like a bit of a
 
02:22:24.950 --> 02:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
technicality or technical procedure uh
 
02:22:26.790 --> 02:22:26.800 align:start position:0%
that bill is working its way through the
 
02:22:28.550 --> 02:22:28.560 align:start position:0%
process but we wanted to have this as a
 
02:22:30.389 --> 02:22:30.399 align:start position:0%
vehicle in case there was some snag that
 
02:22:32.550 --> 02:22:32.560 align:start position:0%
occurred as that one went through
 
02:22:34.070 --> 02:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
and that is the reason we're adopting
 
02:22:36.630 --> 02:22:36.640 align:start position:0%
the exact same language any further
 
02:22:36.640 --> 02:22:38.950 align:start position:0%
the exact same language any further
discussion

02:22:38.950 --> 02:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
02:22:40.790 --> 02:22:40.800 align:start position:0%
representative bixby yeah i'd just like
 
02:22:42.870 --> 02:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
to sort of uh

difficulty the senate held it up

02:28:53.510 --> 02:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
support for these fairs
 
02:28:55.510 --> 02:28:55.520 align:start position:0%
so i would ask that the committee
 
02:28:57.910 --> 02:28:57.920 align:start position:0%
support this motion of ought to pass
 
02:28:59.990 --> 02:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
while i realized that there may be some
 
02:29:02.230 --> 02:29:02.240 align:start position:0%
concerns about the distribution of the
 
02:29:03.510 --> 02:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
funds in
 
02:29:06.389 --> 02:29:06.399 align:start position:0%
the grant process i believe those
 
02:29:08.790 --> 02:29:08.800 align:start position:0%
those concerns can be
 
02:29:10.469 --> 02:29:10.479 align:start position:0%
taken up in
 
02:29:11.990 --> 02:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
well hopefully ways and means which is
 
02:29:13.110 --> 02:29:13.120 align:start position:0%
what i'm going to ask the speaker to
 
02:29:14.710 --> 02:29:14.720 align:start position:0%
send this bill to
 
02:29:15.750 --> 02:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
02:29:16.870 --> 02:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
we will
 
02:29:19.190 --> 02:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
in the rulemaking process if it is
 
02:29:20.830 --> 02:29:20.840 align:start position:0%
successful in
 
02:29:23.190 --> 02:29:23.200 align:start position:0%
passing i would ask for your support
 
02:29:25.030 --> 02:29:25.040 align:start position:0%
i've ought to pass and open it up for
 
02:29:28.630 --> 02:29:28.640 align:start position:0%
any further uh conversation
 
02:29:30.070 --> 02:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
anybody have any comments they'd like to
 
02:29:30.080 --> 02:29:34.389 align:start position:0%
anybody have any comments they'd like to
make

02:29:34.389 --> 02:29:34.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:36.150 --> 02:29:36.160 align:start position:0%
representative bixby did you want to uh
 
02:29:38.230 --> 02:29:38.240 align:start position:0%
yeah i um
 
02:29:39.510 --> 02:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
i am
 
02:29:41.349 --> 02:29:41.359 align:start position:0%
i'm kind of on the edge with this bill
 
02:29:43.830 --> 02:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
but i think that uh if
 
02:29:45.830 --> 02:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
i'm more comfortable with going to ways
 
02:29:47.990 --> 02:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
and means as a
 
02:29:49.349 --> 02:29:49.359 align:start position:0%
way of
 
02:29:50.950 --> 02:29:50.960 align:start position:0%
examining the
 
02:29:53.830 --> 02:29:53.840 align:start position:0%
funding mechanism more closely so i am
 
02:29:55.830 --> 02:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
going to
 
02:29:57.349 --> 02:29:57.359 align:start position:0%
i'm going to be voting out to pass on
 
02:29:57.359 --> 02:30:03.670 align:start position:0%
i'm going to be voting out to pass on
this

02:30:03.670 --> 02:30:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:05.510 --> 02:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
yeah although i agree with the intent of
 
02:30:06.550 --> 02:30:06.560 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:30:09.110 --> 02:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
um i have a difficult time supporting a
 
02:30:11.590 --> 02:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
bill in which the local communities
 
02:30:11.600 --> 02:30:12.550 align:start position:0%
bill in which the local communities
which

02:30:12.550 --> 02:30:12.560 align:start position:0%
which
 
02:30:14.950 --> 02:30:14.960 align:start position:0%
um reap the economic benefits of a
 
02:30:17.590 --> 02:30:17.600 align:start position:0%
regional fair are unwilling to put in
 
02:30:19.990 --> 02:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
any money when we are really really
 
02:30:22.469 --> 02:30:22.479 align:start position:0%
talking about small
 
02:30:25.910 --> 02:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
change i mean less than 25 000
 
02:30:27.990 --> 02:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
and even that is a high
 
02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:29.670 align:start position:0%
and even that is a high
um

02:30:29.670 --> 02:30:29.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:30:32.710 --> 02:30:32.720 align:start position:0%
you know a high quote and
 
02:30:34.870 --> 02:30:34.880 align:start position:0%
so i i would not be able to support this
 
02:30:36.550 --> 02:30:36.560 align:start position:0%
bill even though
 
02:30:39.750 --> 02:30:39.760 align:start position:0%
i you know do support the idea that
 
02:30:42.630 --> 02:30:42.640 align:start position:0%
regional and state fairs should
 
02:31:12.790 --> 02:31:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:16.630 --> 02:31:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:18.230 --> 02:31:18.240 align:start position:0%
well i guess i'll use uh representative
 
02:31:20.469 --> 02:31:20.479 align:start position:0%
aaron's mic
 
02:31:21.750 --> 02:31:21.760 align:start position:0%

14-3

14-3
 
02:32:28.230 --> 02:32:28.240 align:start position:0%
with a vote of 14 3 the ought to pass
 
02:32:31.110 --> 02:32:31.120 align:start position:0%
motion carries on house bill 1584. will
 
02:32:34.230 --> 02:32:34.240 align:start position:0%
there be a minority report
 
02:32:49.910 --> 02:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:51.670 --> 02:32:51.680 align:start position:0%
because the bill has a fiscal note of
 
02:32:55.349 --> 02:32:55.359 align:start position:0%
250 000 we cannot put it on consent so
 
02:33:01.510 --> 02:33:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:03.429 --> 02:33:03.439 align:start position:0%
with a minority report you can't put it
 
02:33:05.590 --> 02:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
on because that either
 
02:33:05.600 --> 02:33:06.469 align:start position:0%
on because that either
understood

02:33:06.469 --> 02:33:06.479 align:start position:0%
understood
 
02:33:12.230 --> 02:33:12.240 align:start position:0%

representative mason to speak to his
 
02:33:41.280 --> 02:33:42.389 align:start position:0%
representative mason to speak to his
motion

02:33:42.389 --> 02:33:42.399 align:start position:0%
motion
 
02:33:44.870 --> 02:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chair i'd just like to
 
02:33:45.910 --> 02:33:45.920 align:start position:0%
say that
 
02:33:48.870 --> 02:33:48.880 align:start position:0%
we heard a lot of testimony on this
 
02:33:48.880 --> 02:33:50.070 align:start position:0%
we heard a lot of testimony on this
and

02:33:50.070 --> 02:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:33:53.510 --> 02:33:53.520 align:start position:0%
i understand it's a very controversial
 
02:33:55.590 --> 02:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
medical procedure
 
02:33:57.670 --> 02:33:57.680 align:start position:0%
but through the testimony we've also
 
02:34:00.230 --> 02:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
heard that the veterinarian
 
02:34:01.990 --> 02:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
of the state of new hampshire have been
 
02:34:04.630 --> 02:34:04.640 align:start position:0%
moving great strides away from this and
 
02:34:06.630 --> 02:34:06.640 align:start position:0%
this seems to be policing itself without
 
02:34:09.110 --> 02:34:09.120 align:start position:0%
having to have legislation to do so it
 
02:34:09.120 --> 02:34:10.790 align:start position:0%
having to have legislation to do so it
also

02:34:10.790 --> 02:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
also
 
02:34:14.830 --> 02:34:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:14.840 --> 02:34:16.389 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:34:16.389 --> 02:34:16.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:34:16.399 --> 02:34:18.790 align:start position:0%
um
criminal

02:34:18.790 --> 02:34:18.800 align:start position:0%
criminal
 
02:34:21.830 --> 02:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
prosecution against veterinarians
 
02:34:26.070 --> 02:34:26.080 align:start position:0%
when this subject needs this
 
02:34:29.590 --> 02:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
subject needs to be between the
 
02:34:31.750 --> 02:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
owners of the pets and the veterinarian
 
02:34:33.750 --> 02:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
who advises now most of them advise not
 
02:34:35.990 --> 02:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
to have this operation so
 
02:34:37.110 --> 02:34:37.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:34:40.230 --> 02:34:40.240 align:start position:0%
thank you representative any further
 
02:34:44.309 --> 02:34:44.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:47.830 --> 02:34:47.840 align:start position:0%
um i represented bixby yes uh
 
02:34:47.840 --> 02:34:49.030 align:start position:0%
um i represented bixby yes uh
so

02:34:49.030 --> 02:34:49.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:34:49.040 --> 02:34:50.469 align:start position:0%
so
uh

02:34:50.469 --> 02:34:50.479 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:34:53.270 --> 02:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
i think that uh declawing is definitely
 
02:34:56.389 --> 02:34:56.399 align:start position:0%
not a good procedure but i think and i'm
 
02:35:00.150 --> 02:35:00.160 align:start position:0%
particular but i i um
 
02:35:01.910 --> 02:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
but with this particular bill i'm
 
02:35:04.550 --> 02:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
particularly disturbed by the uh
 
02:35:08.230 --> 02:35:08.240 align:start position:0%
criminalization and i think that uh
 
02:35:11.349 --> 02:35:11.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't that does not make sense uh
 
02:35:13.990 --> 02:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
and i also
 
02:35:17.190 --> 02:35:17.200 align:start position:0%
the testimony seemed to indicate that
 
02:35:18.950 --> 02:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
it's not a very common procedure in new
 
02:35:21.349 --> 02:35:21.359 align:start position:0%
hampshire and
 
02:35:21.359 --> 02:35:22.389 align:start position:0%
hampshire and
that

02:35:22.389 --> 02:35:22.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:35:22.399 --> 02:35:23.429 align:start position:0%
that
the

02:35:23.429 --> 02:35:23.439 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:35:25.590 --> 02:35:25.600 align:start position:0%
veterinary the new hampshire veterinary
 
02:35:28.309 --> 02:35:28.319 align:start position:0%
medical veterinary association
 
02:35:32.150 --> 02:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:34.870 --> 02:35:34.880 align:start position:0%
some confusion between
 
02:35:37.030 --> 02:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
a correct procedure an incorrect
 
02:35:37.040 --> 02:35:38.230 align:start position:0%
a correct procedure an incorrect
procedure

02:35:38.230 --> 02:35:38.240 align:start position:0%
procedure
 
02:35:40.630 --> 02:35:40.640 align:start position:0%
leading to criminalization of their
 
02:35:43.910 --> 02:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
member of veterinarians in the state and
 
02:35:47.110 --> 02:35:47.120 align:start position:0%
i think those reasons uh sort of add up
 
02:35:49.910 --> 02:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
to uh not making this particular version
 
02:35:53.990 --> 02:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:57.590 --> 02:35:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:59.110 --> 02:35:59.120 align:start position:0%
the chair would like to add that i
 
02:36:01.190 --> 02:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
support all the reasons given for itl
 
02:36:03.349 --> 02:36:03.359 align:start position:0%
and i think our veterinarians do a very
 
02:36:05.750 --> 02:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
good job in a very conscientious job of
 
02:36:09.270 --> 02:36:09.280 align:start position:0%
managing their clients and and
 
02:36:11.429 --> 02:36:11.439 align:start position:0%
making the right choices and i'm
 
02:36:13.510 --> 02:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
supporting itl on this bill because i
 
02:36:14.870 --> 02:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
really don't think it's a new hampshire
 
02:36:16.870 --> 02:36:16.880 align:start position:0%
problem and i think we're uh
 
02:36:18.630 --> 02:36:18.640 align:start position:0%
we have again we have a very good group
 
02:36:20.630 --> 02:36:20.640 align:start position:0%
of veterinaries with veterinarians
 
02:36:22.070 --> 02:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
within our state that are doing an
 
02:36:24.469 --> 02:36:24.479 align:start position:0%
excellent job
 
02:36:26.150 --> 02:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
