all okay welcome I apologize for being a
 
00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:53.799 align:start position:0%
little late um you'll understand in a
 
00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 align:start position:0%
minute um going to open up the notice a
 
00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 align:start position:0%
uh public hearing for the house election
 
00:04:01.869 --> 00:04:01.879 align:start position:0%
law committee on Senate Bill 489 FN
 
00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
relative to election audits uh I believe
 
00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 align:start position:0%
Senator gray is here to introduce the
 
00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 align:start position:0%
bill Senator welcome uh thank you Mr
 
00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 align:start position:0%
chair my name is James Gray I am the
 
00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 align:start position:0%
senator representing Senate District 6
 
00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 align:start position:0%
which starts up in Alton gton comes down
 
00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 align:start position:0%
Route 11 to Rochester and the
 
00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 align:start position:0%
communities in between uh this bill is a
 
00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:28.479 align:start position:0%
continuation of uh the audits that we
 
00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 align:start position:0%
preliminarily uh authorized a couple
 
00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 align:start position:0%
years ago uh tried them for a year they
 
00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 align:start position:0%
worked out very well uh it's got some
 
00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 align:start position:0%
updates with Lessons Learned in there uh
 
00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 align:start position:0%
and uh again uh we're trying to provide
 
00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 align:start position:0%
uh the people with assurance that the
 
00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 align:start position:0%
elections are conducted properly and
 
00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 align:start position:0%
that uh the results that they get are
 
00:04:57.189 --> 00:04:57.199 align:start position:0%
uh uh with the new machines now
 
00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:02.199 align:start position:0%
the uh ability to um do certain things
 
00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 align:start position:0%
is enhanced with those uh one of the
 
00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:07.479 align:start position:0%
things that I will point out that's
 
00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 align:start position:0%
different than what we've done in the
 
00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
past is on page two and it goes into
 
00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
lines 22 21
 
00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 align:start position:0%
through um 25 I guess and that's uh
 
00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
allowing uh certain ballots to have a an
 
00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 align:start position:0%
Auditor's Mark put on them uh so so that
 
00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:34.479 align:start position:0%
uh if we take random ballots and uh
 
00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 align:start position:0%
select a few you know that we are going
 
00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:39.919 align:start position:0%
to do for our sample uh that those can
 
00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:43.800 align:start position:0%
be uh identified during the scan process
 
00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
so that we know how those ballots were
 
00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:49.759 align:start position:0%
actually counted uh in the machine uh
 
00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:52.720 align:start position:0%
and that was a request done in
 
00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:54.160 align:start position:0%
conjunction with the Secretary of
 
00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:56.120 align:start position:0%
State's office and I'd be happy to
 
00:05:58.629 --> 00:05:58.639 align:start position:0%
answer any questions that you
 
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
have questions from the
 
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
committee F yes resent HR thank you um
 
00:06:08.589 --> 00:06:08.599 align:start position:0%
how do you how would you go about
 
00:06:11.589 --> 00:06:11.599 align:start position:0%
opening up the boxes and getting 50
 
00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:15.160 align:start position:0%
ballots out can you explain that please
 
00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:16.840 align:start position:0%
well the
 
00:06:20.029 --> 00:06:20.039 align:start position:0%
process uh if you watched what we did
 
00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:23.360 align:start position:0%
last time we did the whole thing um you
 
00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:26.360 align:start position:0%
know opening the the boxes was part of
 
00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:29.680 align:start position:0%
the audit procedure um and at that time
 
00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:32.680 align:start position:0%
we scanned every ballot into there I
 
00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:34.840 align:start position:0%
can't remember exactly whether we're
 
00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
scanning each one of the ones now I
 
00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:41.560 align:start position:0%
believe that we are uh but uh
 
00:06:44.309 --> 00:06:44.319 align:start position:0%
again the way that it was done is that
 
00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
they were done in groups of some
 
00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:51.280 align:start position:0%
reasonable number okay and then inside
 
00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:53.360 align:start position:0%
the machine it tallied the things that
 
00:06:56.869 --> 00:06:56.879 align:start position:0%
were in those groups uh certainly uh one
 
00:06:59.749 --> 00:06:59.759 align:start position:0%
of the ways to do this uh would have
 
00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:02.360 align:start position:0%
been to say well I'm going to pick one
 
00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:05.840 align:start position:0%
of those particular groups of ballots
 
00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
because you can get the reports and they
 
00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:11.000 align:start position:0%
thought it was better to be able to put
 
00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:13.800 align:start position:0%
a mark on the ballot an auditor Mark in
 
00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:16.520 align:start position:0%
a field you know somewhere not
 
00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:18.440 align:start position:0%
associated with any of the election
 
00:07:20.909 --> 00:07:20.919 align:start position:0%
results and then be able to pull that
 
00:07:24.869 --> 00:07:24.879 align:start position:0%
back from from the uh the machine uh so
 
00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:27.160 align:start position:0%
that it wasn't you know this group that
 
00:07:28.909 --> 00:07:28.919 align:start position:0%
group and this other group but it was
 
00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:33.400 align:start position:0%
more random thing so uh you know they're
 
00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:36.800 align:start position:0%
open you know they're processed uh the
 
00:07:40.749 --> 00:07:40.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:42.469 --> 00:07:42.479 align:start position:0%
resealed further questions
 
00:07:42.479 --> 00:07:43.749 align:start position:0%
resealed further questions
representative

00:07:43.749 --> 00:07:43.759 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:45.960 align:start position:0%
we and thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:48.080 align:start position:0%
Senator gray for taking my question um
 
00:07:49.629 --> 00:07:49.639 align:start position:0%
is there any what's the rationale for
 
00:07:53.149 --> 00:07:53.159 align:start position:0%
the 2% sampling size uh we had to pick a
 
00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:56.800 align:start position:0%
number uh and if you go into statistics
 
00:07:58.390 --> 00:07:58.400 align:start position:0%
uh trying to figure out what the
 
00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:01.000 align:start position:0%
standard deviations are what you know
 
00:08:04.629 --> 00:08:04.639 align:start position:0%
the positives are you know that's uh if
 
00:08:07.749 --> 00:08:07.759 align:start position:0%
you you take within five standard
 
00:08:09.909 --> 00:08:09.919 align:start position:0%
deviation or with within a standard
 
00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:13.000 align:start position:0%
deviation but you you narrow it you get
 
00:08:14.589 --> 00:08:14.599 align:start position:0%
to a
 
00:08:17.749 --> 00:08:17.759 align:start position:0%
99.86 whatever percent accuracy you know
 
00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:19.960 align:start position:0%
the mathematicians all know that kind of
 
00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:24.560 align:start position:0%
stuff um but the numbers in here more
 
00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
rely on what we think is reasonable what
 
00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:29.080 align:start position:0%
do we think we could do uh with the
 
00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:31.560 align:start position:0%
average machine in New Hampshire around
 
00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:34.360 align:start position:0%
2,000 to 3,000 ballots go through it on
 
00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:36.800 align:start position:0%
Election Day you know that certainly
 
00:08:39.949 --> 00:08:39.959 align:start position:0%
also injured into our calculations and
 
00:08:43.269 --> 00:08:43.279 align:start position:0%
trying to do uh a a count in the morning
 
00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:46.240 align:start position:0%
and a count in the afternoon for the two
 
00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:50.920 align:start position:0%
days uh for each machine that we deploy
 
00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:53.320 align:start position:0%
uh so that would be uh you know two
 
00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:56.040 align:start position:0%
deploying two machines so we would have
 
00:08:57.910 --> 00:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
eight in total which is the number that
 
00:09:00.069 --> 00:09:00.079 align:start position:0%
you see there again we're we're trying
 
00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
to keep the numbers reasonable but also
 
00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:06.240 align:start position:0%
have that assurance and I think although
 
00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:07.600 align:start position:0%
some people would like to see that
 
00:09:09.389 --> 00:09:09.399 align:start position:0%
number smaller some people would like to
 
00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:11.680 align:start position:0%
see it bigger I think we we've got as
 
00:09:13.829 --> 00:09:13.839 align:start position:0%
best to compromise as that I could come
 
00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
up with okay thank
 
00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
you further questions from the
 
00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:21.160 align:start position:0%
committee oh I'm sorry representative
 
00:09:23.389 --> 00:09:23.399 align:start position:0%
Lane thank you thank you Senator gray
 
00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:26.920 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um I actually
 
00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:32.040 align:start position:0%
have two so um um on where it talks
 
00:09:34.389 --> 00:09:34.399 align:start position:0%
about the paper ballots for each device
 
00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:37.760 align:start position:0%
audited shall be processed by the audit
 
00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:42.200 align:start position:0%
equipment what is the audit equipment I
 
00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:45.680 align:start position:0%
guess I just wasn't in the in the last
 
00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:48.720 align:start position:0%
bill that we had that again sunsetted
 
00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:50.480 align:start position:0%
after the first
 
00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:53.160 align:start position:0%
application uh the Secretary of State
 
00:09:55.829 --> 00:09:55.839 align:start position:0%
went out and did a procurement of
 
00:09:58.430 --> 00:09:58.440 align:start position:0%
scanning equipment that could be used to
 
00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
count the votes on the ballot um and
 
00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:05.880 align:start position:0%
that along with the the uh the the
 
00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:07.480 align:start position:0%
computer that goes along with the
 
00:10:10.389 --> 00:10:10.399 align:start position:0%
scanning equipment and the printers and
 
00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:13.720 align:start position:0%
all of that that constitutes the audit
 
00:10:15.949 --> 00:10:15.959 align:start position:0%
equipment so it's the same as best I
 
00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:17.560 align:start position:0%
know it's the same equipment that we
 
00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:19.640 align:start position:0%
used two years ago when we did the last
 
00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:23.640 align:start position:0%
ones okay um take a followup it's not
 
00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:25.640 align:start position:0%
actually it's a followup it's just a sec
 
00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
a different question sure
 
00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:30.509 align:start position:0%
a different question sure
um

00:10:30.509 --> 00:10:30.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:32.829 --> 00:10:32.839 align:start position:0%
what are there any Criterion for the
 
00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:35.320 align:start position:0%
selection of the audit locations or is
 
00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:38.120 align:start position:0%
this something that the secretary would
 
00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:41.680 align:start position:0%
just pick have the vision of a fishbowl
 
00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:44.720 align:start position:0%
with all the numbers but how how does
 
00:10:46.829 --> 00:10:46.839 align:start position:0%
how does that happen when they when if
 
00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:49.160 align:start position:0%
you're I'm going to change your question
 
00:10:51.389 --> 00:10:51.399 align:start position:0%
just slightly and say when we pick the
 
00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
devices that we're going to audit
 
00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:55.200 align:start position:0%
because we're not auditing locations
 
00:10:58.230 --> 00:10:58.240 align:start position:0%
we're auditing devices and as long as
 
00:11:00.269 --> 00:11:00.279 align:start position:0%
the ballots are seg at and that's one of
 
00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:03.200 align:start position:0%
the reasons to give the the the
 
00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:05.880 align:start position:0%
community notice if they've got multiple
 
00:11:07.829 --> 00:11:07.839 align:start position:0%
machines so that we don't have to scan
 
00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
all the ballots through all the machines
 
00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
we only have to segregate the ballots
 
00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:14.440 align:start position:0%
that went through one particular machine
 
00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh but uh what we've done is is in here
 
00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:20.480 align:start position:0%
we talk about that they are able to
 
00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
group these into various groups of so if
 
00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:26.800 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that we we scan
 
00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:29.720 align:start position:0%
voting Works ones and we scan the ones
 
00:11:33.829 --> 00:11:33.839 align:start position:0%
from Dominion okay and you know on about
 
00:11:36.509 --> 00:11:36.519 align:start position:0%
an equal basis or we want to take a
 
00:11:38.389 --> 00:11:38.399 align:start position:0%
large community and we also want to take
 
00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:40.440 align:start position:0%
a medium-sized Community or a small
 
00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:42.920 align:start position:0%
community they are able to segregate
 
00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:45.560 align:start position:0%
those into those and then that choice
 
00:11:48.389 --> 00:11:48.399 align:start position:0%
from that community that they establish
 
00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:52.440 align:start position:0%
will be a random draw or you know
 
00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:54.680 align:start position:0%
somebody throwing a dart however they
 
00:11:58.230 --> 00:11:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:00.790 align:start position:0%
 
it

00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:02.720 align:start position:0%
um thank you I just wasn't quite sure
 
00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:05.480 align:start position:0%
how that happened and then um is it the
 
00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:08.720 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State alone or is it his
 
00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:11.680 align:start position:0%
staff I mean how does that work I think
 
00:12:13.509 --> 00:12:13.519 align:start position:0%
that the secretary of state is
 
00:12:17.949 --> 00:12:17.959 align:start position:0%
represented uh and I I I think that uh
 
00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
uh I did not enter into how that
 
00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:22.440 align:start position:0%
selection was done uh they assured me
 
00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:24.680 align:start position:0%
that it was done in a random basis and
 
00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
from the results that I saw on the last
 
00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
time uh we had different parts of the
 
00:12:31.269 --> 00:12:31.279 align:start position:0%
state we had different size communities
 
00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
we had all of those things would make me
 
00:12:37.629 --> 00:12:37.639 align:start position:0%
believe that they did a very good job of
 
00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:42.440 align:start position:0%
that representative bernon thank you um
 
00:12:48.069 --> 00:12:48.079 align:start position:0%
I have a question on line 14 of page one
 
00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:50.680 align:start position:0%
um it says the devices and the towns or
 
00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
city wards where devices to be audited
 
00:12:57.069 --> 00:12:57.079 align:start position:0%
are located shall be
 
00:12:59.550 --> 00:12:59.560 align:start position:0%
nonpublic and then in the following
 
00:13:02.389 --> 00:13:02.399 align:start position:0%
section it says
 
00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:05.720 align:start position:0%
um that the secretary shall not announce
 
00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
until after the polls are open on
 
00:13:13.509 --> 00:13:13.519 align:start position:0%
Election Day and so I'm wondering if
 
00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:17.720 align:start position:0%
um if the secretary is announcing
 
00:13:21.949 --> 00:13:21.959 align:start position:0%
it on Election Day would that not be
 
00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:25.480 align:start position:0%
public and are those two lines in
 
00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:28.040 align:start position:0%
conflict with each other uh certainly
 
00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
the information is going to be public at
 
00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
some point uh the point that we're
 
00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
trying to get to here is that if the
 
00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
general public knew what machines we
 
00:13:43.269 --> 00:13:43.279 align:start position:0%
were going to be auditing on what day uh
 
00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:44.920 align:start position:0%
that that would defeat the purpose of
 
00:13:46.629 --> 00:13:46.639 align:start position:0%
doing the audit in the first place
 
00:13:49.509 --> 00:13:49.519 align:start position:0%
because you would not do anything so we
 
00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
want before we we identify which
 
00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:54.800 align:start position:0%
machines and which communities those
 
00:13:57.310 --> 00:13:57.320 align:start position:0%
machines are in we want to make sure
 
00:13:59.710 --> 00:13:59.720 align:start position:0%
that they are up and running on Election
 
00:14:02.629 --> 00:14:02.639 align:start position:0%
Day and that no other modifications
 
00:14:04.389 --> 00:14:04.399 align:start position:0%
would be made to them after they're put
 
00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:08.560 align:start position:0%
into the service and so I don't see the
 
00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:11.680 align:start position:0%
inconsistency in there this is that
 
00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:13.680 align:start position:0%
their selection criteria would not be
 
00:14:16.069 --> 00:14:16.079 align:start position:0%
done in an open session you know when
 
00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
they pick the machines uh they would not
 
00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:21.000 align:start position:0%
be announced ahead of time uh the
 
00:14:22.949 --> 00:14:22.959 align:start position:0%
assignment of the people who actually go
 
00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
out to the polls U because what they've
 
00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:27.160 align:start position:0%
done in the past is they've actually
 
00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:29.800 align:start position:0%
hadn't you know sent somebody to those
 
00:14:32.269 --> 00:14:32.279 align:start position:0%
locations to help them and make sure
 
00:14:33.949 --> 00:14:33.959 align:start position:0%
that they were able to segregate the
 
00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
balance that went through that
 
00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:38.560 align:start position:0%
particular machine all of those things
 
00:14:42.629 --> 00:14:42.639 align:start position:0%
need to be nonpublic so that these uh
 
00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
you know that the the the randomness of
 
00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:47.720 align:start position:0%
the count and not allowing any
 
00:14:50.629 --> 00:14:50.639 align:start position:0%
modifications can all happen uh before
 
00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:53.440 align:start position:0%
we actually go and uh announce the
 
00:14:55.829 --> 00:14:55.839 align:start position:0%
machine but but we want to announce them
 
00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
earlier in the day than what we did
 
00:15:00.949 --> 00:15:00.959 align:start position:0%
before because in in a large election or
 
00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:04.160 align:start position:0%
a place a community that that is trying
 
00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
to get away with one machine where they
 
00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:09.680 align:start position:0%
might better have more machines uh that
 
00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:12.600 align:start position:0%
if they start putting ballots into a box
 
00:15:16.069 --> 00:15:16.079 align:start position:0%
because the machine is you know full uh
 
00:15:18.629 --> 00:15:18.639 align:start position:0%
the bin is full uh then you lose the
 
00:15:21.389 --> 00:15:21.399 align:start position:0%
opportunity to segregate the balance for
 
00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:23.720 align:start position:0%
that particular machine and it makes
 
00:15:27.949 --> 00:15:27.959 align:start position:0%
that audit process much more
 
00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:30.880 align:start position:0%
difficult representative rafter thank
 
00:15:32.269 --> 00:15:32.279 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thanks for taking my
 
00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:35.000 align:start position:0%
question um you so you have done some of
 
00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
these audits on kind of a trial basis
 
00:15:39.189 --> 00:15:39.199 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious how many times you
 
00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:42.440 align:start position:0%
found discrepancies between the original
 
00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
voting machines and the audit equipment
 
00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:47.240 align:start position:0%
uh those reports are all available
 
00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:48.910 align:start position:0%
uh those reports are all available
online

00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:48.920 align:start position:0%
online
 
00:15:52.069 --> 00:15:52.079 align:start position:0%
you because the different
 
00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:54.360 align:start position:0%
scanners and I'll I'll back up just a
 
00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
little bit and move the mic so I can see
 
00:15:59.790 --> 00:15:59.800 align:start position:0%
you uh the scanners certainly the
 
00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
sensitivity and selectivity of how they
 
00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
interpret those ovals are going to be
 
00:16:09.189 --> 00:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
slightly different okay and so we do not
 
00:16:12.629 --> 00:16:12.639 align:start position:0%
expect that the count be exact okay
 
00:16:14.509 --> 00:16:14.519 align:start position:0%
because of that because of the limited
 
00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
technology that we have we don't know uh
 
00:16:20.269 --> 00:16:20.279 align:start position:0%
when we did the Windom audit uh there
 
00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:23.160 align:start position:0%
was some machines that uh uh the lights
 
00:16:25.069 --> 00:16:25.079 align:start position:0%
were very sensitive some machines the
 
00:16:27.269 --> 00:16:27.279 align:start position:0%
lights weren't as sensitive in the
 
00:16:29.749 --> 00:16:29.759 align:start position:0%
window machine but overall we we got a
 
00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:32.600 align:start position:0%
very good count and the reason that we
 
00:16:36.069 --> 00:16:36.079 align:start position:0%
actually announced those results prior
 
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
to the last day to request a recount is
 
00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:40.600 align:start position:0%
so that
 
00:16:43.629 --> 00:16:43.639 align:start position:0%
the people the candidates who are being
 
00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:46.480 align:start position:0%
voted for can look at those results and
 
00:16:48.829 --> 00:16:48.839 align:start position:0%
say yeah there there's enough of a
 
00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
difference between this machine that
 
00:16:54.389 --> 00:16:54.399 align:start position:0%
machine uh that I do want to recount uh
 
00:16:56.509 --> 00:16:56.519 align:start position:0%
it also allows the Secretary of State to
 
00:16:59.189 --> 00:16:59.199 align:start position:0%
review those results and say we need to
 
00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:02.800 align:start position:0%
do more of an audit which is also in in
 
00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:05.160 align:start position:0%
the bill you know that allows them to do
 
00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:08.480 align:start position:0%
that so slight difference yeah we expect
 
00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:11.480 align:start position:0%
that there will be you know one two
 
00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
depending upon but you know that may be
 
00:17:18.669 --> 00:17:18.679 align:start position:0%
one or two per 500 or a thousand uh and
 
00:17:21.870 --> 00:17:21.880 align:start position:0%
not a large number but again you know
 
00:17:26.429 --> 00:17:26.439 align:start position:0%
giving you if your uh race was being uh
 
00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:29.960 align:start position:0%
audited okay the opportunity to say yeah
 
00:17:31.549 --> 00:17:31.559 align:start position:0%
there is a difference here and I want
 
00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:34.240 align:start position:0%
that recount you have the opportunity to
 
00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:36.549 align:start position:0%
that recount you have the opportunity to
do

00:17:36.549 --> 00:17:36.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:39.280 align:start position:0%
it further questions from the
 
00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:41.240 align:start position:0%
committee I just want to clarify so this
 
00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:44.360 align:start position:0%
is the basically reinstalling the audit
 
00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:47.440 align:start position:0%
that Sunset and then adding a provision
 
00:17:51.549 --> 00:17:51.559 align:start position:0%
for uh to
 
00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
65936 rent it it in a nutshell in a
 
00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
nutshell uh and it also updates the
 
00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
language so that you know uh any
 
00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
differences between the acote machines
 
00:18:05.789 --> 00:18:05.799 align:start position:0%
and the new the authorized machines you
 
00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:09.320 align:start position:0%
know will be taken into
 
00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
consideration okay any other questions
 
00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
from the committee I'm seeing none thank
 
00:18:17.909 --> 00:18:17.919 align:start position:0%
you thank you gray um Senator you're not
 
00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:21.520 align:start position:0%
introducing the next bill right no um
 
00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
okay uh next up will be Olivia zinc with
 
00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:26.600 align:start position:0%
open de actually excuse me let's go to
 
00:18:28.549 --> 00:18:28.559 align:start position:0%
Aaron Hennessy I apologize dep secretary
 
00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
sorry I love you I she was deputy
 
00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:37.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
entry good morning everyone Aaron
 
00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:41.360 align:start position:0%
Hennessy deputy secretary of state I
 
00:18:43.549 --> 00:18:43.559 align:start position:0%
just want to say uh we support this
 
00:18:46.789 --> 00:18:46.799 align:start position:0%
legislation um I do want to point out uh
 
00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
representative Brennan's question about
 
00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
the um non-public maybe there could be a
 
00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
few words added in that section just to
 
00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:56.120 align:start position:0%
make it clear that at some point we do
 
00:18:57.510 --> 00:18:57.520 align:start position:0%
have to announce Which towns we're
 
00:19:00.549 --> 00:19:00.559 align:start position:0%
auditing um in the past our audits have
 
00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
been um very successful and proven that
 
00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:04.520 align:start position:0%
the devices that we use here in New
 
00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:07.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to count our ballots um are
 
00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
very um efficient and um um accurate uh
 
00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
we would love to see these come back
 
00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
into legislation so that in September
 
00:19:19.669 --> 00:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
and November and in future presidential
 
00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
primaries we can continue to um have
 
00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
audits for um for transparency purposes
 
00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:27.640 align:start position:0%
to assure that everyone here in New
 
00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that um the machines that we
 
00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:33.720 align:start position:0%
use to tabulate our results are accurate
 
00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:38.200 align:start position:0%
um just a reminder we have um two
 
00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:40.120 align:start position:0%
different ballot counting devices in use
 
00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:42.400 align:start position:0%
here now in New Hampshire the ACU vote
 
00:19:44.110 --> 00:19:44.120 align:start position:0%
and the voting Works device the voting
 
00:19:46.029 --> 00:19:46.039 align:start position:0%
Works device was used in five different
 
00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:49.240 align:start position:0%
locations in March town meeting um we
 
00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:50.720 align:start position:0%
anticipate that in some point in the
 
00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
future we'll have a third the Dominion
 
00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
device um we do not use any of these
 
00:19:59.390 --> 00:19:59.400 align:start position:0%
brands for the um the tab ation or the
 
00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:01.640 align:start position:0%
odd purposes we use a clear ballot
 
00:20:05.149 --> 00:20:05.159 align:start position:0%
device to audit um the ballots that come
 
00:20:06.909 --> 00:20:06.919 align:start position:0%
that are tabulated by any of those two
 
00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
or possibly three machines uh we think
 
00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
that's a good way to um improve
 
00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:15.080 align:start position:0%
transparency um and that device um is
 
00:20:17.029 --> 00:20:17.039 align:start position:0%
constantly tested to make sure that it
 
00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:19.400 align:start position:0%
can accurately count the ballots that
 
00:20:22.029 --> 00:20:22.039 align:start position:0%
are being programmed by the two to
 
00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
possibly three different vendors we have
 
00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:26.840 align:start position:0%
so uh to sum it up I am um very
 
00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
supportive of this legislation our
 
00:20:31.669 --> 00:20:31.679 align:start position:0%
office is I'm happy today questions if
 
00:20:32.549 --> 00:20:32.559 align:start position:0%
you have
 
00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:37.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:40.280 align:start position:0%
committee okay thank you that was okay
 
00:20:41.909 --> 00:20:41.919 align:start position:0%
uh next up now we have Miss syc I
 
00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:49.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:51.789 --> 00:20:51.799 align:start position:0%
fake uh good morning members of the
 
00:20:54.149 --> 00:20:54.159 align:start position:0%
committee uh for the record I'm a voter
 
00:20:55.909 --> 00:20:55.919 align:start position:0%
Olivia zinc voter in Franklin and
 
00:20:57.990 --> 00:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
executive director of open democracy and
 
00:20:59.909 --> 00:20:59.919 align:start position:0%
we are in support of post-election
 
00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:02.280 align:start position:0%
audits um post-election audits are
 
00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
simple um and a proven way to increase
 
00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:07.880 align:start position:0%
confidence um I just want to sort of
 
00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:10.760 align:start position:0%
answer representative rafter question um
 
00:21:13.669 --> 00:21:13.679 align:start position:0%
in 2022 we had four post-election audits
 
00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:17.480 align:start position:0%
there's a 72 76 page report on the
 
00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:20.320 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's website um but in
 
00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:24.760 align:start position:0%
Tilton um there was um
 
00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:27.240 align:start position:0%
1,546 ballots that were run through the
 
00:21:29.549 --> 00:21:29.559 align:start position:0%
Acura vote machine on ction day and the
 
00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:32.240 align:start position:0%
clear B ballot audit had the identical
 
00:21:36.149 --> 00:21:36.159 align:start position:0%
amount um they also audited Durham and
 
00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:41.880 align:start position:0%
5,873 and the audit showed that there
 
00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:43.110 align:start position:0%
5,873 and the audit showed that there
were

00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:46.200 align:start position:0%
5,872 so there was one ballot different
 
00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
and they show the documentation on that
 
00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
summersworth ward 3 was another
 
00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
community in 2022 that was audited on
 
00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:56.200 align:start position:0%
Election Day ACU vote showed
 
00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
856 ballots and clear ballot um showed
 
00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:05.480 align:start position:0%
8,5 um 104 so two ballots different on
 
00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:07.400 align:start position:0%
Election uh from the post- elction
 
00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:10.520 align:start position:0%
Audits and then they also did Pembrook
 
00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
um and it was
 
00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:15.480 align:start position:0%
3,241 and then on the clear ballot
 
00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
showed um
 
00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
3,248 so there was seven ballots
 
00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:22.840 align:start position:0%
different and that could just be things
 
00:22:25.149 --> 00:22:25.159 align:start position:0%
that were you know put on the side
 
00:22:27.029 --> 00:22:27.039 align:start position:0%
pocket on Election Day or there could
 
00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:28.840 align:start position:0%
there's reasons in the in the report
 
00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:31.240 align:start position:0%
shows the different discrepancies and
 
00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
also people don't read the instructions
 
00:22:34.909 --> 00:22:34.919 align:start position:0%
on the top of the ballot on how to Mark
 
00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:37.640 align:start position:0%
a ballot so it says fill in the oval and
 
00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:40.640 align:start position:0%
people do all Kind Checks X's all kinds
 
00:22:43.789 --> 00:22:43.799 align:start position:0%
of crazy things that um are showing
 
00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:46.880 align:start position:0%
those um differences but I also would
 
00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:49.960 align:start position:0%
want to mention um post elction audits
 
00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:52.200 align:start position:0%
happen across the country 34 other
 
00:22:54.909 --> 00:22:54.919 align:start position:0%
community 30 or four other states have
 
00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
um these things we passed a trial
 
00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
version um that happened
 
00:23:01.549 --> 00:23:01.559 align:start position:0%
after the 2022 elections you passed
 
00:23:04.149 --> 00:23:04.159 align:start position:0%
another bill to to to make this happen
 
00:23:06.149 --> 00:23:06.159 align:start position:0%
and it lost in Committee of conference
 
00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:09.240 align:start position:0%
and I think that you know eight eight
 
00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
ballot counting devices was what the
 
00:23:13.909 --> 00:23:13.919 align:start position:0%
Senate has in this bill and I think the
 
00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
house might have took a six ballot
 
00:23:18.029 --> 00:23:18.039 align:start position:0%
counting devices position there was like
 
00:23:21.669 --> 00:23:21.679 align:start position:0%
a difference between which ones um but I
 
00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:23.720 align:start position:0%
however many you do six or eight I think
 
00:23:25.669 --> 00:23:25.679 align:start position:0%
it's important that you do it or four
 
00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:28.640 align:start position:0%
like you did um two years ago so I think
 
00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:30.440 align:start position:0%
that's the important thing and I think
 
00:23:31.789 --> 00:23:31.799 align:start position:0%
the other thing I'll just mention is
 
00:23:34.269 --> 00:23:34.279 align:start position:0%
that maybe in line 15 you can say prior
 
00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:38.240 align:start position:0%
to election day so prior to election day
 
00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:40.360 align:start position:0%
the it's non-public which machines
 
00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:42.080 align:start position:0%
you're going to do and then that sort of
 
00:23:45.669 --> 00:23:45.679 align:start position:0%
solves your um problem with it being
 
00:23:47.269 --> 00:23:47.279 align:start position:0%
announced on Election Day and becomes
 
00:23:49.549 --> 00:23:49.559 align:start position:0%
public that's just one suggestion in
 
00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:51.960 align:start position:0%
line 15 on on page
 
00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
one um I'm happy to take any
 
00:23:58.750 --> 00:23:58.760 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative warar um uh
 
00:24:00.549 --> 00:24:00.559 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
my question um so the numbers you just
 
00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:04.760 align:start position:0%
read off from the report are
 
00:24:07.390 --> 00:24:07.400 align:start position:0%
substantially more substantially more
 
00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:09.440 align:start position:0%
than the amounts listed here for the
 
00:24:11.909 --> 00:24:11.919 align:start position:0%
sampling I'm sorry that I didn't direct
 
00:24:14.149 --> 00:24:14.159 align:start position:0%
this question to deputy secretary
 
00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:17.360 align:start position:0%
earlier but um no my understanding is
 
00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:20.360 align:start position:0%
that they do the ballots that were run
 
00:24:22.549 --> 00:24:22.559 align:start position:0%
through the machine and then they they
 
00:24:24.789 --> 00:24:24.799 align:start position:0%
look at paper ballots they look at 50
 
00:24:28.350 --> 00:24:28.360 align:start position:0%
paper ballots so they do the scan part
 
00:24:30.269 --> 00:24:30.279 align:start position:0%
and then they look at 50 paper ballots
 
00:24:33.149 --> 00:24:33.159 align:start position:0%
or 2% so you're you're hand you're doing
 
00:24:36.389 --> 00:24:36.399 align:start position:0%
hand count 2% hand count it's yeah you
 
00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
the the paper ballot is a sort of person
 
00:24:41.669 --> 00:24:41.679 align:start position:0%
looking at that many ballots and the
 
00:24:43.909 --> 00:24:43.919 align:start position:0%
Machine runs through everything that the
 
00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:46.480 align:start position:0%
machine looked at but then they just
 
00:24:48.909 --> 00:24:48.919 align:start position:0%
randomly select 50 ballots where real
 
00:24:51.269 --> 00:24:51.279 align:start position:0%
humans look at them so that's just the
 
00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:54.120 align:start position:0%
and I think that you know um some of the
 
00:24:56.389 --> 00:24:56.399 align:start position:0%
folks that do this nationally say it
 
00:24:58.710 --> 00:24:58.720 align:start position:0%
should be a 100 ballots but whatever I
 
00:25:00.909 --> 00:25:00.919 align:start position:0%
think it's important that you look at
 
00:25:04.350 --> 00:25:04.360 align:start position:0%
some thank you for clarifying that I now
 
00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
so I see on line two of page two the
 
00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:09.029 align:start position:0%
so I see on line two of page two the
physical

00:25:09.029 --> 00:25:09.039 align:start position:0%
physical
 
00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
examination of it and so
 
00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
it's it it's sort a uh pseudo hand
 
00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
counter hand you know ver manual
 
00:25:22.029 --> 00:25:22.039 align:start position:0%
verification of the process he selected
 
00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:23.440 align:start position:0%
so thank you for that clarification yeah
 
00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:25.360 align:start position:0%
and I and I think on the other point is
 
00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:27.200 align:start position:0%
like some communities have multiple
 
00:25:28.909 --> 00:25:28.919 align:start position:0%
machines in their town so if you pick
 
00:25:32.029 --> 00:25:32.039 align:start position:0%
Dairy they have multiple machines or
 
00:25:34.149 --> 00:25:34.159 align:start position:0%
Bedford has multiple machines they're
 
00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
just doing the ballots that were run
 
00:25:38.389 --> 00:25:38.399 align:start position:0%
through one machine um if you picked
 
00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
Franklin Ward 2 we only use one machine
 
00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:44.320 align:start position:0%
so it's easy to sort of say that one
 
00:25:46.110 --> 00:25:46.120 align:start position:0%
machine in Franklin War I is the one
 
00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:47.960 align:start position:0%
machine but in some of the other ones
 
00:25:50.389 --> 00:25:50.399 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't know which of the multiple
 
00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:52.600 align:start position:0%
machines they're using so I think that's
 
00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:54.640 align:start position:0%
where you have to have that announcement
 
00:25:57.430 --> 00:25:57.440 align:start position:0%
to election workers on Election Day so
 
00:25:59.470 --> 00:25:59.480 align:start position:0%
that they know everything that runs
 
00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:01.360 align:start position:0%
through this machine has to be boxed up
 
00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:03.480 align:start position:0%
separately to go to the Post elction
 
00:26:04.909 --> 00:26:04.919 align:start position:0%
audit because it could get really
 
00:26:04.919 --> 00:26:07.149 align:start position:0%
audit because it could get really
confusing

several familiar faces um for the record
 
00:28:52.149 --> 00:28:52.159 align:start position:0%
I am Senator Rebecca Perkins quoka from
 
00:28:54.149 --> 00:28:54.159 align:start position:0%

00:28:59.110 --> 00:28:59.120 align:start position:0%

and New Market I have all the news um
 
00:29:05.029 --> 00:29:05.039 align:start position:0%
today I am introducing Senate Bill 535
 
00:29:08.149 --> 00:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
an act relative to absentee ballot forms
 
00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:10.840 align:start position:0%
this bill amends RSA
 
00:29:14.830 --> 00:29:14.840 align:start position:0%
6574 to align it with RSA
 
00:29:17.149 --> 00:29:17.159 align:start position:0%
6571 the purpose of the bill is not to
 
00:29:19.470 --> 00:29:19.480 align:start position:0%
change policy or to expand the
 
00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:21.240 align:start position:0%
requirements regarding absentee voting
 
00:29:23.710 --> 00:29:23.720 align:start position:0%
in any way it is simply correcting two
 
00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:26.640 align:start position:0%
misaligned conflicting State statutes SP
 
00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:28.960 align:start position:0%
535 updates the ction of the absentee
 
00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:31.120 align:start position:0%
ballot request form regarding receiving
 
00:29:32.830 --> 00:29:32.840 align:start position:0%
an absentee ballot in the case of a
 
00:29:35.470 --> 00:29:35.480 align:start position:0%
winter storm warning due to concerns
 
00:29:37.630 --> 00:29:37.640 align:start position:0%
about traveling to the polls in doing so
 
00:29:40.029 --> 00:29:40.039 align:start position:0%
it corrects the conflicting language
 
00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:41.640 align:start position:0%
that regulates who
 
00:29:46.029 --> 00:29:46.039 align:start position:0%
qualifies the change will
 
00:29:48.549 --> 00:29:48.559 align:start position:0%
um this change will directly affect that
 
00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:50.720 align:start position:0%
the ballot request form to match RSA
 
00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:53.480 align:start position:0%
6571 regarding the scenario will match
 
00:29:57.070 --> 00:29:57.080 align:start position:0%
up I'm happy to take any questions other
 
00:29:59.669 --> 00:29:59.679 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
00:30:01.950 --> 00:30:01.960 align:start position:0%
um I imagine not because we have already
 
00:30:06.669 --> 00:30:06.679 align:start position:0%
passed this um so okay not this bill but
 
00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:10.480 align:start position:0%
we passed this um I believe it is I
 
00:30:12.350 --> 00:30:12.360 align:start position:0%
think we voted it out last week right
 
00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
yeah we voted it out last week so I
 
00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
think you guys have ours which is
 
00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:17.480 align:start position:0%
actually even more simplistic than this
 
00:30:20.430 --> 00:30:20.440 align:start position:0%
okay um does the same thing okay um so
 
00:30:23.909 --> 00:30:23.919 align:start position:0%
good luck great good luck uh would you
 
00:30:26.990 --> 00:30:27.000 align:start position:0%

00:30:33.269 --> 00:30:33.279 align:start position:0%

00:30:50.509 --> 00:30:50.519 align:start position:0%
one pink card rep uh representative zc
 
00:30:54.750 --> 00:30:54.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:57.070 --> 00:30:57.080 align:start position:0%
democracy good morning again for the
 
00:30:58.830 --> 00:30:58.840 align:start position:0%
record Olivia Franklin New Hampshire
 
00:31:00.990 --> 00:31:01.000 align:start position:0%
executive director of open democracy um
 
00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
I just want to say that absentee ballot
 
00:31:05.710 --> 00:31:05.720 align:start position:0%
uh absentee voting is nonpartisan
 
00:31:07.870 --> 00:31:07.880 align:start position:0%
according to the institute for uh
 
00:31:10.430 --> 00:31:10.440 align:start position:0%
responsive government re research shows
 
00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:12.720 align:start position:0%
that no party gains anything from having
 
00:31:15.509 --> 00:31:15.519 align:start position:0%
allowing absentee loss uh we were very
 
00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
lucky this year with Town meetings that
 
00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
we didn't have snowstorms last week um
 
00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:23.000 align:start position:0%
and no one needed to cancel elections
 
00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
but in the case that uh winter storms uh
 
00:31:29.950 --> 00:31:29.960 align:start position:0%
blizzards happen on Election Day this um
 
00:31:33.629 --> 00:31:33.639 align:start position:0%
uh strikes the language on page one line
 
00:31:38.190 --> 00:31:38.200 align:start position:0%
uh 24 um that I'm infirmed um I'm
 
00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:40.440 align:start position:0%
elderly affirmed or have a physical
 
00:31:43.029 --> 00:31:43.039 align:start position:0%
disability um and I think that it's
 
00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:45.080 align:start position:0%
important that anyone who's concerned
 
00:31:47.269 --> 00:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
about a winter storm can vote even if
 
00:31:50.269 --> 00:31:50.279 align:start position:0%
they're not elderly or infirmed um and I
 
00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
want to thank this committee and Kathy
 
00:31:54.509 --> 00:31:54.519 align:start position:0%
Pruno O'Brien H who has a slightly
 
00:31:57.029 --> 00:31:57.039 align:start position:0%
different version of this bill that does
 
00:31:58.470 --> 00:31:58.480 align:start position:0%
that strikes slightely different
 
00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:00.840 align:start position:0%
language but the concept is very very
 
00:32:03.269 --> 00:32:03.279 align:start position:0%
much the same I did bring a copy of the
 
00:32:05.149 --> 00:32:05.159 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot request form so you can
 
00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
see the language of uh elderly infirmed
 
00:32:10.590 --> 00:32:10.600 align:start position:0%
on the prior to election day but
 
00:32:12.789 --> 00:32:12.799 align:start position:0%
basically it makes this form the same as
 
00:32:12.799 --> 00:32:14.029 align:start position:0%
basically it makes this form the same as
the

00:32:14.029 --> 00:32:14.039 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:16.360 align:start position:0%
statute okay questions from the
 
00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:18.760 align:start position:0%
committee saying none thank you I have
 
00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:22.120 align:start position:0%

ready to go online this time there were
 
00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:26.840 align:start position:0%
12 people in support four opposed uh on
 
00:32:30.549 --> 00:32:30.559 align:start position:0%
48 n since I wasn't quick on the draw on
 
00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:33.120 align:start position:0%

00:32:35.470 --> 00:32:35.480 align:start position:0%
opposed uh there was here there was one
 
00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:37.720 align:start position:0%
person signed up in support who did not
 
00:32:39.389 --> 00:32:39.399 align:start position:0%
speak that happens to be the Secretary
 
00:32:42.990 --> 00:32:43.000 align:start position:0%
of State's office um with that I will
 
00:32:47.269 --> 00:32:47.279 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing on SB
 
00:32:50.029 --> 00:32:50.039 align:start position:0%
535 um
 
00:32:53.149 --> 00:32:53.159 align:start position:0%

10:31 right just some say some say best
 
00:32:58.990 --> 00:32:59.000 align:start position:0%

requirement it
 
00:35:21.310 --> 00:35:21.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:26.630 align:start position:0%
 
me

00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:26.640 align:start position:0%

here okay in case anybody's wondering
 
00:35:36.349 --> 00:35:36.359 align:start position:0%
why we're doing this one first it's
 
00:35:37.630 --> 00:35:37.640 align:start position:0%
because we're going to go through the
 
00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
amendment and if we find things that are
 
00:35:41.670 --> 00:35:41.680 align:start position:0%
wrong we will hopefully have time with
 
00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
OS to fix the amendment and take it up
 
00:35:44.950 --> 00:35:44.960 align:start position:0%
at the end of Executives that's why
 
00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
we're starting with this one so please
 
00:35:49.270 --> 00:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
do your due diligence
 
00:35:52.109 --> 00:35:52.119 align:start position:0%
um and and take a good long look we have
 
00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
time um but we do have to act on this
 
00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:56.630 align:start position:0%
time um but we do have to act on this
bill

00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:56.640 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:36:17.790 --> 00:36:17.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
be I guess I would ask um representative
 
00:36:26.550 --> 00:36:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:30.560 align:start position:0%
it I'm looking for the the waiver term
 
00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:32.480 align:start position:0%
where the reports that we were going to
 
00:36:35.790 --> 00:36:35.800 align:start position:0%
let people who could apply for a waver
 
00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
to the secretary of state from um filing
 
00:36:40.270 --> 00:36:40.280 align:start position:0%
online I think our committee researcher
 
00:36:45.790 --> 00:36:45.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:49.390 --> 00:36:49.400 align:start position:0%
out and and what
 
00:36:56.510 --> 00:36:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:59.589 align:start position:0%
 
much

00:36:59.589 --> 00:36:59.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:03.150 --> 00:37:03.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:07.150 --> 00:37:07.160 align:start position:0%
30 okay so basically if you spend less
 
00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:08.550 align:start position:0%
30 okay so basically if you spend less
than

00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
than
 
00:37:11.470 --> 00:37:11.480 align:start position:0%
3,000 and um you don't possess a
 
00:37:14.589 --> 00:37:14.599 align:start position:0%
computer the skills to file statements
 
00:37:19.349 --> 00:37:19.359 align:start position:0%
pursuant um you ask for a waiver and um
 
00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:20.720 align:start position:0%
and the secretary of state will look at
 
00:37:24.190 --> 00:37:24.200 align:start position:0%
it and um approve or disapprove uh we
 
00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:26.760 align:start position:0%
can tweak this later in after a couple
 
00:37:28.349 --> 00:37:28.359 align:start position:0%
years as people will get used to the
 
00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
system um my guess is uh and and the
 
00:37:33.349 --> 00:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
secretary deputy secretary of state just
 
00:37:36.829 --> 00:37:36.839 align:start position:0%
told me that everybody is entered into
 
00:37:39.470 --> 00:37:39.480 align:start position:0%
the online campaign system because if we
 
00:37:43.150 --> 00:37:43.160 align:start position:0%
don't do it they do it so that even if
 
00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
you haven't um registered as a candidate
 
00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
you're required to register but they
 
00:37:51.109 --> 00:37:51.119 align:start position:0%
will register you at least you're in the
 
00:37:57.069 --> 00:37:57.079 align:start position:0%
system so that's that one um I I would
 
00:37:59.829 --> 00:37:59.839 align:start position:0%
like to
 
00:38:03.589 --> 00:38:03.599 align:start position:0%
um let people know that we our version
 
00:38:05.470 --> 00:38:05.480 align:start position:0%
of the this version of the bill is
 
00:38:10.390 --> 00:38:10.400 align:start position:0%
phasing in using the online system
 
00:38:13.829 --> 00:38:13.839 align:start position:0%
and so the first time somebody will be
 
00:38:17.109 --> 00:38:17.119 align:start position:0%
required to use the online system would
 
00:38:19.550 --> 00:38:19.560 align:start position:0%
be for the
 
00:38:22.030 --> 00:38:22.040 align:start position:0%
next we're facing it in we're having the
 
00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:24.240 align:start position:0%
governor the executive counsel and the
 
00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:25.710 align:start position:0%
governor the executive counsel and the
state

00:38:25.710 --> 00:38:25.720 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:38:28.589 --> 00:38:28.599 align:start position:0%
senate go first because there's less of
 
00:38:30.950 --> 00:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
them and we thought it might be easier
 
00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
to get some of the quirks out before we
 
00:38:36.589 --> 00:38:36.599 align:start position:0%
uh put 400 of us into the system and
 
00:38:38.829 --> 00:38:38.839 align:start position:0%
start using it and uh asking a lot of
 
00:38:44.349 --> 00:38:44.359 align:start position:0%
questions so the thought is um that the
 
00:38:47.430 --> 00:38:47.440 align:start position:0%
way we defined election cycle it starts
 
00:38:51.870 --> 00:38:51.880 align:start position:0%
21 days after the election so the
 
00:38:54.150 --> 00:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
election cycle for
 
00:38:58.430 --> 00:38:58.440 align:start position:0%
2026 starts 21 days
 
00:39:01.349 --> 00:39:01.359 align:start position:0%
after election in
 
00:39:08.430 --> 00:39:08.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:14.910 --> 00:39:14.920 align:start position:0%
date 26 for 26 the election cycle starts
 
00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:18.800 align:start position:0%
that day 21 days after and goes
 
00:39:22.349 --> 00:39:22.359 align:start position:0%
through next 21 days after the 26
 
00:39:25.109 --> 00:39:25.119 align:start position:0%
election and the reason we did that was
 
00:39:28.309 --> 00:39:28.319 align:start position:0%
because people you know came pay a lot
 
00:39:30.190 --> 00:39:30.200 align:start position:0%
and raise money a lot and we want them
 
00:39:32.630 --> 00:39:32.640 align:start position:0%
to be able you know to capture those and
 
00:39:35.550 --> 00:39:35.560 align:start position:0%
require them to um be transparent about
 
00:39:37.309 --> 00:39:37.319 align:start position:0%
it we're not limiting them it's just to
 
00:39:40.670 --> 00:39:40.680 align:start position:0%
be transparent about it so it it that's
 
00:39:44.550 --> 00:39:44.560 align:start position:0%
on the bottom of page four it's line
 
00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:47.880 align:start position:0%
37 so I just want to flag that because
 
00:39:50.790 --> 00:39:50.800 align:start position:0%
originally when we had defined U we had
 
00:39:53.309 --> 00:39:53.319 align:start position:0%
not defined election cycle and it was a
 
00:39:55.910 --> 00:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
different date it was uh in in
 
00:39:59.390 --> 00:39:59.400 align:start position:0%
2025 and then if you go over on page
 
00:40:03.510 --> 00:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
five uh line three that date is wrong it
 
00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:06.800 align:start position:0%
should be November 24th
 
00:40:14.670 --> 00:40:14.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
2025 this is
 
00:40:19.589 --> 00:40:19.599 align:start position:0%
why I just wanted everybody to look at
 
00:40:22.109 --> 00:40:22.119 align:start position:0%
it because it just because this is a an
 
00:40:25.309 --> 00:40:25.319 align:start position:0%
important date so it would be yeah two
 
00:40:28.270 --> 00:40:28.280 align:start position:0%
years later right yeah
 
00:40:31.510 --> 00:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
okay so we do we need to fix that yeah
 
00:40:34.190 --> 00:40:34.200 align:start position:0%
I'm going to have her fix that um and
 
00:40:37.190 --> 00:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
there was a a couple other they're under
 
00:40:39.630 --> 00:40:39.640 align:start position:0%
um because we're taking out the
 
00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:41.680 align:start position:0%
definition of political advocacy
 
00:40:46.309 --> 00:40:46.319 align:start position:0%
committee um it popped up in the um
 
00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
chart where you where they have uh how
 
00:40:52.150 --> 00:40:52.160 align:start position:0%
how much an individual can donate and
 
00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:53.829 align:start position:0%
how much an individual can donate and
that

00:40:53.829 --> 00:40:53.839 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:40:53.839 --> 00:40:55.750 align:start position:0%
that
chart

00:40:55.750 --> 00:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
chart
 
00:40:59.829 --> 00:40:59.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:03.680 align:start position:0%
page six yeah so that will take that out
 
00:41:07.550 --> 00:41:07.560 align:start position:0%
and that's one other little knit so
 
00:41:11.349 --> 00:41:11.359 align:start position:0%
anything like grammar and misspellings
 
00:41:14.349 --> 00:41:14.359 align:start position:0%
they can we can fix if we when we get
 
00:41:18.030 --> 00:41:18.040 align:start position:0%
over to the Senate side um and uh also
 
00:41:20.870 --> 00:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
when it's enrolled they will usually fix
 
00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
those kind of things um
 
00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
so that's it
 
00:41:29.910 --> 00:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
I guess I would like to go through it
 
00:41:33.349 --> 00:41:33.359 align:start position:0%
one one time more before we vote so can
 
00:41:33.359 --> 00:41:34.550 align:start position:0%
one one time more before we vote so can
I

00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:41:37.030 --> 00:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
go back in the
 
00:41:40.670 --> 00:41:40.680 align:start position:0%
corner because it's 13 pages long and we
 
00:41:43.309 --> 00:41:43.319 align:start position:0%
yeah everybody we're in we're in no rush
 
00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:45.880 align:start position:0%
on this um does anybody
 
00:41:50.150 --> 00:41:50.160 align:start position:0%

00:42:27.950 --> 00:42:27.960 align:start position:0%
later that language is in this
 
00:42:31.069 --> 00:42:31.079 align:start position:0%
amendment um and right now because of
 
00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:34.240 align:start position:0%
we're going to we're mandating the
 
00:42:38.069 --> 00:42:38.079 align:start position:0%
online after a certain time that will
 
00:42:41.190 --> 00:42:41.200 align:start position:0%
gradually disappear because that allows
 
00:42:43.710 --> 00:42:43.720 align:start position:0%
for PDFs and that kind of stuff so if
 
00:42:46.750 --> 00:42:46.760 align:start position:0%
you're entering it directly into the
 
00:42:50.549 --> 00:42:50.559 align:start position:0%
online system the that piece won't be
 
00:42:56.109 --> 00:42:56.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:56.119 --> 00:42:59.829 align:start position:0%
 
here

00:42:59.829 --> 00:42:59.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:02.510 --> 00:43:02.520 align:start position:0%
yes the font size yes the infamous font
 
00:43:06.390 --> 00:43:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:08.470 --> 00:43:08.480 align:start position:0%
higher I can tell you where that road
 
00:43:13.150 --> 00:43:13.160 align:start position:0%
ends if you'd like oh I've been
 
00:43:15.270 --> 00:43:15.280 align:start position:0%
there yeah there's definitely not a pot
 
00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
of gold any know that rainbow
 
00:43:21.630 --> 00:43:21.640 align:start position:0%
um okay so we'll let representative Lane
 
00:43:24.510 --> 00:43:24.520 align:start position:0%
go off and do that thing I will recess
 
00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
house B 1091 we are taking this up today
 
00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:27.630 align:start position:0%
house B 1091 we are taking this up today
so

00:43:27.630 --> 00:43:27.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:43:31.150 --> 00:43:31.160 align:start position:0%
don't don't go anywhere um I'll try to
 
00:43:33.069 --> 00:43:33.079 align:start position:0%
sit over there and just go Page by Page
 
00:43:35.990 --> 00:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
through it okay um and then I can come
 
00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:38.640 align:start position:0%
back over yes representative anenberg uh
 
00:43:41.230 --> 00:43:41.240 align:start position:0%
can you tell me where it shows or
 
00:43:44.069 --> 00:43:44.079 align:start position:0%
reflects the font size uh let's take a
 
00:43:44.079 --> 00:43:45.430 align:start position:0%
reflects the font size uh let's take a
look

00:43:45.430 --> 00:43:45.440 align:start position:0%
look
 
00:43:50.829 --> 00:43:50.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:52.870 --> 00:43:52.880 align:start position:0%
37 eight point
 
00:43:56.030 --> 00:43:56.040 align:start position:0%
font there you
 
00:43:59.750 --> 00:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
go one one other thing is we need to
 
00:44:01.470 --> 00:44:01.480 align:start position:0%
make the we were going to make the
 
00:44:04.150 --> 00:44:04.160 align:start position:0%
effective date of this section this
 
00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
section only um immediately like 60 days
 
00:44:11.549 --> 00:44:11.559 align:start position:0%
after passage and that way that stuff
 
00:44:13.870 --> 00:44:13.880 align:start position:0%
all for this election will go in like
 
00:44:16.270 --> 00:44:16.280 align:start position:0%
that then the rest of the bill will be
 
00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
effective on January 1 2025 so I need to
 
00:44:23.349 --> 00:44:23.359 align:start position:0%
clarify that at the last um on the last
 
00:44:25.390 --> 00:44:25.400 align:start position:0%
page the goal is to incorporate the
 
00:44:27.630 --> 00:44:27.640 align:start position:0%
language of s SP 530
 
00:44:32.069 --> 00:44:32.079 align:start position:0%
into our larger campaign Finance reform
 
00:44:35.630 --> 00:44:35.640 align:start position:0%
um so so yeah because there's that Bill
 
00:44:38.030 --> 00:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
was 60 days after passage so I wanted
 
00:44:41.470 --> 00:44:41.480 align:start position:0%
that section the same way so it it it's
 
00:44:43.710 --> 00:44:43.720 align:start position:0%
kind of our first
 
00:44:47.190 --> 00:44:47.200 align:start position:0%
step so we we are overhauling campaign
 
00:44:49.430 --> 00:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
Finance while also updating campaign
 
00:44:51.270 --> 00:44:51.280 align:start position:0%
finance and also changing campaign
 
00:44:54.750 --> 00:44:54.760 align:start position:0%
Finance so what could go wrong
 
00:44:58.270 --> 00:44:58.280 align:start position:0%
um so we we may be cleaning up some
 
00:45:01.109 --> 00:45:01.119 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences next year yeah I
 
00:45:03.910 --> 00:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
imagine we will um and that's okay um
 
00:45:05.630 --> 00:45:05.640 align:start position:0%
but we're going to make
 
00:45:07.950 --> 00:45:07.960 align:start position:0%
it I guess we we not we're we're in
 
00:45:09.549 --> 00:45:09.559 align:start position:0%
recess we'll come back to discussion of
 
00:45:13.150 --> 00:45:13.160 align:start position:0%
the bill but um okay um I'm going to
 
00:45:16.910 --> 00:45:16.920 align:start position:0%
open up the executive session on Senate
 
00:45:19.870 --> 00:45:19.880 align:start position:0%
Bill 490 FN and before you go
 
00:45:21.670 --> 00:45:21.680 align:start position:0%
representative Lane I need
 
00:45:25.950 --> 00:45:25.960 align:start position:0%
you uh to make the motion on
 
00:45:28.510 --> 00:45:28.520 align:start position:0%
this uh 490 FN relative to the
 
00:45:55.910 --> 00:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:55.920 --> 00:46:25.910 align:start position:0%
 
checklist

00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:36.390 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:46:36.390 --> 00:46:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:39.309 --> 00:46:39.319 align:start position:0%
it's okay I'll make the motion um okay
 
00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh I'm going to move uh Senate Bill 490
 
00:46:44.990 --> 00:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
FN uh to be inexpedient to legislate is
 
00:46:47.150 --> 00:46:47.160 align:start position:0%
there a second representative weel
 
00:46:49.470 --> 00:46:49.480 align:start position:0%
second me um speak to the motion real
 
00:46:51.910 --> 00:46:51.920 align:start position:0%
quick um we've already pass this we
 
00:46:53.150 --> 00:46:53.160 align:start position:0%
already passed a version of this out of
 
00:46:56.510 --> 00:46:56.520 align:start position:0%
the house um I see no reason to take two
 
00:46:58.030 --> 00:46:58.040 align:start position:0%
house positions the house already has a
 
00:47:00.069 --> 00:47:00.079 align:start position:0%
position um it's up to the Senate what
 
00:47:02.349 --> 00:47:02.359 align:start position:0%
they want to do with that um so I will
 
00:47:04.430 --> 00:47:04.440 align:start position:0%
be uh while I appreciate the sentiment
 
00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:06.160 align:start position:0%
of this bill I have already voted for
 
00:47:07.309 --> 00:47:07.319 align:start position:0%
what I believe is a better version of
 
00:47:09.990 --> 00:47:10.000 align:start position:0%
this bill um so I'm going to get rid of
 
00:47:12.990 --> 00:47:13.000 align:start position:0%
this bill further discussion on the
 
00:47:15.190 --> 00:47:15.200 align:start position:0%
motion of ined to legislate yes
 
00:47:18.349 --> 00:47:18.359 align:start position:0%
representative War I'll just add uh per
 
00:47:21.470 --> 00:47:21.480 align:start position:0%
my testimony on this bill the other day
 
00:47:23.990 --> 00:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
is that I I really think that the
 
00:47:27.390 --> 00:47:27.400 align:start position:0%
fiveyear cycle adds to a inconsist y
 
00:47:30.790 --> 00:47:30.800 align:start position:0%
across elections I I think there was
 
00:47:33.390 --> 00:47:33.400 align:start position:0%
ample evidence if if anyone reviewed the
 
00:47:36.190 --> 00:47:36.200 align:start position:0%
email I sent to the committee or or read
 
00:47:38.750 --> 00:47:38.760 align:start position:0%
the testimony that I presented in hard
 
00:47:42.630 --> 00:47:42.640 align:start position:0%
copy on uh earlier so I think based on
 
00:47:46.950 --> 00:47:46.960 align:start position:0%
that I I I don't think that this is a a
 
00:47:50.750 --> 00:47:50.760 align:start position:0%
good thing to to set up for uh having
 
00:47:53.069 --> 00:47:53.079 align:start position:0%
the elections to be inconsistent year-to
 
00:47:56.030 --> 00:47:56.040 align:start position:0%
year and across uh different
 
00:47:58.190 --> 00:47:58.200 align:start position:0%
presidential election election cycle so
 
00:48:00.750 --> 00:48:00.760 align:start position:0%
um that's why I support the
 
00:48:02.910 --> 00:48:02.920 align:start position:0%
itl further discussion on the motion of
 
00:48:05.430 --> 00:48:05.440 align:start position:0%

um as I said during the recess executive
 
00:49:51.430 --> 00:49:51.440 align:start position:0%
session on House Bill 1091 we are
 
00:49:55.230 --> 00:49:55.240 align:start position:0%
incorporating this um bill into house
 
00:49:58.030 --> 00:49:58.040 align:start position:0%
bill 1091 so there's no point in putting
 
00:50:02.230 --> 00:50:02.240 align:start position:0%
two pieces forward um so I'm that that's
 
00:50:04.990 --> 00:50:05.000 align:start position:0%
why I'm moving this the language was
 
00:50:09.470 --> 00:50:09.480 align:start position:0%
taken verbatim and put in um almost
 
00:50:12.030 --> 00:50:12.040 align:start position:0%
verbatim and put in um except we got to

inexpedient to legislate I'll second
 
00:51:44.710 --> 00:51:44.720 align:start position:0%
that motion um like to speak to your
 
00:51:47.589 --> 00:51:47.599 align:start position:0%
motion representative
 
00:51:51.670 --> 00:51:51.680 align:start position:0%
qua y uh yes thank you Mr chairman this
 
00:51:57.230 --> 00:51:57.240 align:start position:0%
bill uh is very very similar to HB 11 19
 
00:51:59.349 --> 00:51:59.359 align:start position:0%
which we passed out of this committee
 
00:52:05.109 --> 00:52:05.119 align:start position:0%
recently uh like uh HP 1119 this bill
 
00:52:07.789 --> 00:52:07.799 align:start position:0%
brings the uh contents of the absente
 
00:52:09.710 --> 00:52:09.720 align:start position:0%
ballot request
 
00:52:13.230 --> 00:52:13.240 align:start position:0%
form uh into consistency with the
 
00:52:15.950 --> 00:52:15.960 align:start position:0%
underlying statute that defines the
 
00:52:15.960 --> 00:52:17.390 align:start position:0%
underlying statute that defines the
eligibility

00:52:17.390 --> 00:52:17.400 align:start position:0%
eligibility
 
00:52:19.710 --> 00:52:19.720 align:start position:0%
requirements for uh receiving an
 
00:52:23.150 --> 00:52:23.160 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot therefore it's uh
 
00:52:27.030 --> 00:52:27.040 align:start position:0%
thoroughly redundant and there's no need
 
00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:30.720 align:start position:0%
to pass it therefore I am recommending
 
00:52:33.829 --> 00:52:33.839 align:start position:0%
itl on it thank you y uh any other
 
00:52:34.910 --> 00:52:34.920 align:start position:0%
further discussion on the motion of
 
00:52:37.829 --> 00:52:37.839 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate and I will Echo
 
00:52:40.589 --> 00:52:40.599 align:start position:0%
that sentiment from the vice chairman of
 
00:52:42.190 --> 00:52:42.200 align:start position:0%
we've already passed this they have the
 
00:52:43.470 --> 00:52:43.480 align:start position:0%
Senate has it in their possession it's
 
00:52:45.589 --> 00:52:45.599 align:start position:0%
cleared the house floor um so there's no
 
00:52:47.309 --> 00:52:47.319 align:start position:0%
point in sending duplicative language
 
00:52:49.870 --> 00:52:49.880 align:start position:0%
over to just add the confusion um any
 
00:52:51.990 --> 00:52:52.000 align:start position:0%

01:09:50.749 --> 01:09:50.759 align:start position:0%
380 um relative to moving the state
 
01:09:54.110 --> 01:09:54.120 align:start position:0%
primary date uh I will move this as
 
01:09:56.189 --> 01:09:56.199 align:start position:0%
ought to pass
 
01:09:57.590 --> 01:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
believe representative Osborne is
 
01:10:01.950 --> 01:10:01.960 align:start position:0%
seconding me yep always nice when that
 
01:10:06.229 --> 01:10:06.239 align:start position:0%
happens um is there discussion on the
 
01:10:11.590 --> 01:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:14.669 --> 01:10:14.679 align:start position:0%
380 yes representative Brennan thank you
 
01:10:14.679 --> 01:10:15.630 align:start position:0%
380 yes representative Brennan thank you
Mr

01:10:15.630 --> 01:10:15.640 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
01:10:19.709 --> 01:10:19.719 align:start position:0%
chair um I am concerned about moving the
 
01:10:23.870 --> 01:10:23.880 align:start position:0%
state primary to June it really disrupts
 
01:10:26.830 --> 01:10:26.840 align:start position:0%
um the down ballot race es including
 
01:10:31.510 --> 01:10:31.520 align:start position:0%
State Rep races it disrupts um our
 
01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:32.790 align:start position:0%
State Rep races it disrupts um our
election

01:10:32.790 --> 01:10:32.800 align:start position:0%
election
 
01:10:36.310 --> 01:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
season if the primary is moved to June
 
01:10:40.590 --> 01:10:40.600 align:start position:0%
you have nonstop yearlong election
 
01:10:43.870 --> 01:10:43.880 align:start position:0%
season you will have towns that have
 
01:10:45.870 --> 01:10:45.880 align:start position:0%
town meeting in
 
01:10:48.350 --> 01:10:48.360 align:start position:0%
March those candidates that file for
 
01:10:51.709 --> 01:10:51.719 align:start position:0%
municipal offices file in January they
 
01:10:53.750 --> 01:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
campaign through
 
01:10:55.830 --> 01:10:55.840 align:start position:0%
February and then
 
01:10:58.950 --> 01:10:58.960 align:start position:0%
March elections um town meeting
 
01:11:01.910 --> 01:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
elections some towns hold their town
 
01:11:03.310 --> 01:11:03.320 align:start position:0%
meeting in
 
01:11:07.270 --> 01:11:07.280 align:start position:0%
April and some in May so you will be
 
01:11:09.149 --> 01:11:09.159 align:start position:0%
having some some communities that are
 
01:11:11.910 --> 01:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
dealing with elections from
 
01:11:14.110 --> 01:11:14.120 align:start position:0%
January through
 
01:11:16.350 --> 01:11:16.360 align:start position:0%
May and then they'll have a state
 
01:11:20.430 --> 01:11:20.440 align:start position:0%
Primary in June State primary uh
 
01:11:23.630 --> 01:11:23.640 align:start position:0%
candidates would be filing in about
 
01:11:26.550 --> 01:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
March so you would have campaigning
 
01:11:28.830 --> 01:11:28.840 align:start position:0%
between March and
 
01:11:31.470 --> 01:11:31.480 align:start position:0%
June the winners of the state Primary in
 
01:11:36.229 --> 01:11:36.239 align:start position:0%
June would then campaign from June to
 
01:11:39.110 --> 01:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
November at what point do communities
 
01:11:42.149 --> 01:11:42.159 align:start position:0%
get a break from campaigning from
 
01:11:45.149 --> 01:11:45.159 align:start position:0%
political ads from mailers from yard
 
01:11:48.390 --> 01:11:48.400 align:start position:0%
signs this would have a huge realworld
 
01:11:50.590 --> 01:11:50.600 align:start position:0%
impact on our
 
01:11:54.110 --> 01:11:54.120 align:start position:0%
constituents um I understand that
 
01:11:56.149 --> 01:11:56.159 align:start position:0%
supporters of a junor
 
01:11:59.590 --> 01:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
primary believe this is better for our
 
01:12:01.910 --> 01:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
topof the ticket candidates our
 
01:12:06.709 --> 01:12:06.719 align:start position:0%
Governors our um executive counsel I
 
01:12:07.950 --> 01:12:07.960 align:start position:0%
understand that there is a quick
 
01:12:10.310 --> 01:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
turnaround between our current state
 
01:12:12.550 --> 01:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
Primary in September and our general
 
01:12:14.669 --> 01:12:14.679 align:start position:0%
election in
 
01:12:18.550 --> 01:12:18.560 align:start position:0%
November that's what it is um I
 
01:12:20.310 --> 01:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
understand that it would be better for
 
01:12:22.350 --> 01:12:22.360 align:start position:0%
those candidates but what about our
 
01:12:24.709 --> 01:12:24.719 align:start position:0%
citizen legislature that we are so proud
 
01:12:27.629 --> 01:12:27.639 align:start position:0%
of here in New Hampshire where we have
 
01:12:30.830 --> 01:12:30.840 align:start position:0%
regular folks serving in our state
 
01:12:33.510 --> 01:12:33.520 align:start position:0%
legislature making decisions for our
 
01:12:35.750 --> 01:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
neighbors and our community does this
 
01:12:38.910 --> 01:12:38.920 align:start position:0%
not make it more difficult for them to
 
01:12:42.310 --> 01:12:42.320 align:start position:0%
run and serve in the state legislature
 
01:12:45.550 --> 01:12:45.560 align:start position:0%
when in the second year of the bium they
 
01:12:48.470 --> 01:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
would be still in the middle of
 
01:12:50.709 --> 01:12:50.719 align:start position:0%
legislative work when they would be
 
01:12:54.430 --> 01:12:54.440 align:start position:0%
expected to sign up to run and run a
 
01:12:54.440 --> 01:12:56.030 align:start position:0%
expected to sign up to run and run a
campaign

01:12:56.030 --> 01:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
campaign
 
01:13:01.270 --> 01:13:01.280 align:start position:0%
um that's a lot for $100 a year and it's
 
01:13:03.470 --> 01:13:03.480 align:start position:0%
not about money it's about
 
01:13:06.430 --> 01:13:06.440 align:start position:0%
time regular folks serving in this state
 
01:13:09.830 --> 01:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
legislature who work full-time will now
 
01:13:12.669 --> 01:13:12.679 align:start position:0%
be expected to take time off for their
 
01:13:16.189 --> 01:13:16.199 align:start position:0%
legislative work and campaigning if they
 
01:13:17.070 --> 01:13:17.080 align:start position:0%
want to
 
01:13:21.189 --> 01:13:21.199 align:start position:0%
win and I think a lot of us here
 
01:13:23.350 --> 01:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
um we're certainly not here for the
 
01:13:25.189 --> 01:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
money we're here because there's a
 
01:13:27.750 --> 01:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
purpose in serving our
 
01:13:30.390 --> 01:13:30.400 align:start position:0%
communities but we still
 
01:13:33.229 --> 01:13:33.239 align:start position:0%
need um an
 
01:13:37.709 --> 01:13:37.719 align:start position:0%
income right so this is disruptive to
 
01:13:41.149 --> 01:13:41.159 align:start position:0%
candidates it's disruptive to our
 
01:13:43.709 --> 01:13:43.719 align:start position:0%
communities who would be dealing with
 
01:13:46.270 --> 01:13:46.280 align:start position:0%
this non-stop campaign year we'd be
 
01:13:48.709 --> 01:13:48.719 align:start position:0%
lucky if we had no if we had December
 
01:13:51.149 --> 01:13:51.159 align:start position:0%
off from campaign that's what a June
 
01:13:53.430 --> 01:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
primary would do to us maybe we get
 
01:13:55.790 --> 01:13:55.800 align:start position:0%
December off from campaign
 
01:13:58.790 --> 01:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
this would also lead to a huge influx of
 
01:14:01.510 --> 01:14:01.520 align:start position:0%
money into our elections if you are
 
01:14:04.030 --> 01:14:04.040 align:start position:0%
concerned at all about money in our
 
01:14:06.070 --> 01:14:06.080 align:start position:0%
elections the amount that is spent on
 
01:14:08.310 --> 01:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
each election the amount of instate but
 
01:14:11.390 --> 01:14:11.400 align:start position:0%
also outof State funds that flood into
 
01:14:14.709 --> 01:14:14.719 align:start position:0%
our state for any
 
01:14:18.390 --> 01:14:18.400 align:start position:0%
campaign you wouldn't support a June
 
01:14:22.189 --> 01:14:22.199 align:start position:0%
primary so I'm asking all of you to
 
01:14:24.750 --> 01:14:24.760 align:start position:0%
please consider the real world impact of
 
01:14:27.830 --> 01:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
mov moving our state primary to June
 
01:14:31.270 --> 01:14:31.280 align:start position:0%
where it will affect our constituents if
 
01:14:32.750 --> 01:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
you are not here to serve your
 
01:14:34.750 --> 01:14:34.760 align:start position:0%
constituents and and you are here to
 
01:14:37.229 --> 01:14:37.239 align:start position:0%
make political power plays then by all
 
01:14:39.910 --> 01:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
means support a June primary but if
 
01:14:41.950 --> 01:14:41.960 align:start position:0%
you're here to serve your constituents
 
01:14:44.310 --> 01:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
please consider the real world impact of
 
01:14:47.430 --> 01:14:47.440 align:start position:0%
moving the state primary to June and
 
01:14:50.030 --> 01:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
please vote no on the ought to pass
 
01:14:51.990 --> 01:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
motion so another motion can be made
 
01:14:54.790 --> 01:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
thank you there a further discussion on
 
01:14:56.550 --> 01:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
the the
 
01:14:59.430 --> 01:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
motion uh yes representative PM O'Brien
 
01:15:02.149 --> 01:15:02.159 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman something that
 
01:15:05.149 --> 01:15:05.159 align:start position:0%
didn't come up uh in this conversation
 
01:15:07.750 --> 01:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
but was always in the back of my mind
 
01:15:10.590 --> 01:15:10.600 align:start position:0%
was hurricanes we recently had a
 
01:15:13.629 --> 01:15:13.639 align:start position:0%
blizzard in my community and that was
 
01:15:17.550 --> 01:15:17.560 align:start position:0%
very disruptive to the the um election
 
01:15:19.510 --> 01:15:19.520 align:start position:0%
that we had last
 
01:15:21.990 --> 01:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
year it's difficult to decide what to do
 
01:15:24.990 --> 01:15:25.000 align:start position:0%
during a her a a blizzard but when
 
01:15:27.189 --> 01:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
there's a hurricane this is high
 
01:15:29.390 --> 01:15:29.400 align:start position:0%
September is Peak hurricane season I
 
01:15:30.669 --> 01:15:30.679 align:start position:0%
feel like it's just a matter of time
 
01:15:32.790 --> 01:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
when you deal with the same exact thing
 
01:15:35.790 --> 01:15:35.800 align:start position:0%
so this is not a political power play
 
01:15:38.149 --> 01:15:38.159 align:start position:0%
you could say this was out of concern
 
01:15:40.030 --> 01:15:40.040 align:start position:0%
for my community with that that
 
01:15:43.990 --> 01:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:46.310 --> 01:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
you um any further discussion on the
 
01:15:49.229 --> 01:15:49.239 align:start position:0%
motion I ought to pass um okay I will
 
01:15:51.790 --> 01:15:51.800 align:start position:0%
end this discussion with my diet trive
 
01:15:55.510 --> 01:15:55.520 align:start position:0%
and then we will call the vote um
 
01:15:57.350 --> 01:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
pres Bren I I wrote down points to
 
01:16:00.629 --> 01:16:00.639 align:start position:0%
things you read um non-stop campaigning
 
01:16:02.870 --> 01:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
uh Chuck Morris Kelly aot sending
 
01:16:04.510 --> 01:16:04.520 align:start position:0%
warmington Joyce Craig have been running
 
01:16:06.390 --> 01:16:06.400 align:start position:0%
for governor now for approaching a year
 
01:16:08.550 --> 01:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
so this notion that non-stop campaigning
 
01:16:10.550 --> 01:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
is going to be a thing uh welcome to
 
01:16:13.629 --> 01:16:13.639 align:start position:0%
2024 it's a thing it's already happening
 
01:16:16.430 --> 01:16:16.440 align:start position:0%
um number two this solves our uocava
 
01:16:18.750 --> 01:16:18.760 align:start position:0%
problem number three I have voted for
 
01:16:20.590 --> 01:16:20.600 align:start position:0%
August in the past I have voted for June
 
01:16:23.470 --> 01:16:23.480 align:start position:0%
in the past August meets defeat I want
 
01:16:26.229 --> 01:16:26.239 align:start position:0%
to see this moved in the context of yava
 
01:16:28.990 --> 01:16:29.000 align:start position:0%
so June is the option um as for
 
01:16:30.750 --> 01:16:30.760 align:start position:0%
legislative work there's a lot of ways
 
01:16:32.629 --> 01:16:32.639 align:start position:0%
to address that problem uh the first of
 
01:16:35.229 --> 01:16:35.239 align:start position:0%
which is uh stop filing so many bills um
 
01:16:37.870 --> 01:16:37.880 align:start position:0%
there's like a thousand plus for that
 
01:16:40.189 --> 01:16:40.199 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly go itl and on a consent
 
01:16:41.350 --> 01:16:41.360 align:start position:0%
calendar that we have to have hearings
 
01:16:43.709 --> 01:16:43.719 align:start position:0%
for and stuff like that so please like
 
01:16:45.910 --> 01:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
we could fix that with rules um by the
 
01:16:47.870 --> 01:16:47.880 align:start position:0%
way the house used to not meet in the
 
01:16:50.350 --> 01:16:50.360 align:start position:0%
second year so if you want to if you
 
01:16:51.950 --> 01:16:51.960 align:start position:0%
want to get together about working
 
01:16:53.350 --> 01:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
people and young people being in the
 
01:16:55.430 --> 01:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
legislature I'm happy to do that
 
01:16:57.350 --> 01:16:57.360 align:start position:0%
stop filing so many bills have the
 
01:16:58.790 --> 01:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
committee sessions meet later at night
 
01:17:00.390 --> 01:17:00.400 align:start position:0%
so young people can actually join them
 
01:17:02.350 --> 01:17:02.360 align:start position:0%
and make the committee make the
 
01:17:03.750 --> 01:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
committee recommendation actually
 
01:17:05.430 --> 01:17:05.440 align:start position:0%
binding um and then they will be
 
01:17:07.870 --> 01:17:07.880 align:start position:0%
important uh make the committee smaller
 
01:17:09.470 --> 01:17:09.480 align:start position:0%
would be another option to have more
 
01:17:10.709 --> 01:17:10.719 align:start position:0%
working to have more working people
 
01:17:12.110 --> 01:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
because now not everybody has to be on a
 
01:17:14.790 --> 01:17:14.800 align:start position:0%
committee there's so many options to fix
 
01:17:16.629 --> 01:17:16.639 align:start position:0%
our problem but at the end of the day
 
01:17:20.750 --> 01:17:20.760 align:start position:0%
that's our problem um June September
 
01:17:22.350 --> 01:17:22.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen to work well for me with
 
01:17:24.709 --> 01:17:24.719 align:start position:0%
my what I do for work so what about me
 
01:17:28.669 --> 01:17:28.679 align:start position:0%
um no we don't think like that um number
 
01:17:32.229 --> 01:17:32.239 align:start position:0%
uh next one up is uh incumbents or the
 
01:17:33.510 --> 01:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
primary is going to be the primary is
 
01:17:35.270 --> 01:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
going to affect us and we're
 
01:17:38.350 --> 01:17:38.360 align:start position:0%
incumbents incumbents are rarely primar
 
01:17:41.149 --> 01:17:41.159 align:start position:0%
um and it is almost never successful so
 
01:17:44.870 --> 01:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
in 2022 I think that there were three
 
01:17:47.430 --> 01:17:47.440 align:start position:0%
out of the 400 members were successfully
 
01:17:51.430 --> 01:17:51.440 align:start position:0%
primaried out so less than 1% so 99% uh
 
01:17:53.910 --> 01:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
are totally fine um not really worried
 
01:17:56.390 --> 01:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
about that huge Flux Of Money uh it's an
 
01:17:58.709 --> 01:17:58.719 align:start position:0%
argument of fallacy um the current
 
01:18:01.110 --> 01:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
program suggests that only the money
 
01:18:02.510 --> 01:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
only follows the incumbent who doesn't
 
01:18:05.870 --> 01:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
have a primary so it's not on an even
 
01:18:09.590 --> 01:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
footing um the it's time to put these on
 
01:18:11.430 --> 01:18:11.440 align:start position:0%
an even footing and for the last one
 
01:18:12.830 --> 01:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
here to serve a
 
01:18:15.910 --> 01:18:15.920 align:start position:0%
constituents I agree this would more
 
01:18:17.629 --> 01:18:17.639 align:start position:0%
impact the upper ticket than the down
 
01:18:21.189 --> 01:18:21.199 align:start position:0%
ticket I'll agree with that um 47% of
 
01:18:22.590 --> 01:18:22.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Republicans have been
 
01:18:24.270 --> 01:18:24.280 align:start position:0%
represented 5% of the time in
 
01:18:25.750 --> 01:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
Congressional races over the last 10
 
01:18:27.990 --> 01:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
years one of the biggest reasons why is
 
01:18:30.709 --> 01:18:30.719 align:start position:0%
because we have a joke a laughably late
 
01:18:33.229 --> 01:18:33.239 align:start position:0%
primary of 45 days and the money that
 
01:18:35.310 --> 01:18:35.320 align:start position:0%
would then go into support the 47% that
 
01:18:37.149 --> 01:18:37.159 align:start position:0%
have consistently voted Republican
 
01:18:38.990 --> 01:18:39.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't come because we have set up an
 
01:18:41.750 --> 01:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
incumbent protection plan I am about
 
01:18:44.030 --> 01:18:44.040 align:start position:0%
ending the incumbent protection plan I
 
01:18:45.629 --> 01:18:45.639 align:start position:0%
am voting for this I have voted for
 
01:18:47.430 --> 01:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
August I have voted for June I would
 
01:18:49.550 --> 01:18:49.560 align:start position:0%
vote for July I would vote for whatever
 
01:18:51.709 --> 01:18:51.719 align:start position:0%
you put in front of me that wasn't
 
01:18:55.470 --> 01:18:55.480 align:start position:0%
September um June is the option June is
 
01:18:57.110 --> 01:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
the way forward in the words of the
 
01:19:00.270 --> 01:19:00.280 align:start position:0%

01:24:33.270 --> 01:24:33.280 align:start position:0%
result of that meeting um which was
 
01:24:36.790 --> 01:24:36.800 align:start position:0%
attended by Speaker Packard chairman
 
01:24:39.590 --> 01:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
Barry uh Deputy speaker Smith and
 
01:24:42.030 --> 01:24:42.040 align:start position:0%
chairman of Judiciary uh Representative
 
01:24:45.870 --> 01:24:45.880 align:start position:0%
Bob Lynn um as well as
 
01:24:48.910 --> 01:24:48.920 align:start position:0%
others this amendment incorporates all
 
01:24:51.669 --> 01:24:51.679 align:start position:0%
of the changes suggested during that
 
01:24:55.550 --> 01:24:55.560 align:start position:0%
meeting um and we had reached consensus
 
01:24:57.870 --> 01:24:57.880 align:start position:0%
on both this bill as well as the others
 
01:25:00.870 --> 01:25:00.880 align:start position:0%
and I believe that the bill in judiciary
 
01:25:03.590 --> 01:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
that this was trying to match up with
 
01:25:05.189 --> 01:25:05.199 align:start position:0%
has already been passed through
 
01:25:08.629 --> 01:25:08.639 align:start position:0%
Judiciary and is on the consent calendar
 
01:25:12.470 --> 01:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
for Thursday's house session this bill
 
01:25:14.270 --> 01:25:14.280 align:start position:0%
is important to pass and this amendment
 
01:25:16.950 --> 01:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
is important to pass because it can be
 
01:25:19.910 --> 01:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
um effective this year and none of the
 
01:25:23.310 --> 01:25:23.320 align:start position:0%
other AI bills can be effective this
 
01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:26.510 align:start position:0%
other AI bills can be effective this
year

01:25:26.510 --> 01:25:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:28.189 --> 01:25:28.199 align:start position:0%

the amendment um we've had a very I

believe longstanding not long standing
 
01:25:51.189 --> 01:25:51.199 align:start position:0%
but at least newly standing um agreement
 
01:25:54.270 --> 01:25:54.280 align:start position:0%
that we um let amendments through um
 
01:25:55.310 --> 01:25:55.320 align:start position:0%
even if we don't necessarily agree with
 
01:25:56.590 --> 01:25:56.600 align:start position:0%
the underlying bill and I will be
 
01:25:59.070 --> 01:25:59.080 align:start position:0%

to legislate on House Bill 1596 hearing
 
01:28:16.310 --> 01:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
oh representative inberg you wish you to
 
01:28:18.870 --> 01:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
speak okay yes thank you Mr chairman um
 
01:28:21.590 --> 01:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
so in this is an example I believe of uh
 
01:28:23.350 --> 01:28:23.360 align:start position:0%
putting the cart before the horse um
 
01:28:26.030 --> 01:28:26.040 align:start position:0%
we're we're not really sure of
 
01:28:29.189 --> 01:28:29.199 align:start position:0%
the um really uh clear examples of what
 
01:28:31.070 --> 01:28:31.080 align:start position:0%
we might see in this election cycle
 
01:28:34.590 --> 01:28:34.600 align:start position:0%
regarding Ai and its potential use
 
01:28:39.030 --> 01:28:39.040 align:start position:0%
um there was an example um in Pakistan
 
01:28:40.990 --> 01:28:41.000 align:start position:0%
in their uh most recent uh prime
 
01:28:43.590 --> 01:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
minister elections um where Imran Khan
 
01:28:47.390 --> 01:28:47.400 align:start position:0%
was a candidate for election um the the
 
01:28:49.790 --> 01:28:49.800 align:start position:0%
government had imprisoned him um whether
 
01:28:51.870 --> 01:28:51.880 align:start position:0%
or not those charges are legitimate or
 
01:28:53.390 --> 01:28:53.400 align:start position:0%
not I that's not what we're here to talk
 
01:28:55.750 --> 01:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
about but his campaign was able to use
 
01:28:59.870 --> 01:28:59.880 align:start position:0%
AI in a way that this bill would
 
01:29:03.310 --> 01:29:03.320 align:start position:0%
um uh would criminalize um that speech
 
01:29:05.990 --> 01:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
because or force him to or would have
 
01:29:07.510 --> 01:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
put him in a situation where he would
 
01:29:09.629 --> 01:29:09.639 align:start position:0%
have had to declare that that was um
 
01:29:12.550 --> 01:29:12.560 align:start position:0%
satire or something like that um where
 
01:29:14.510 --> 01:29:14.520 align:start position:0%
the campaign he did not have the ability
 
01:29:17.470 --> 01:29:17.480 align:start position:0%
to campaign um in public and his
 
01:29:21.030 --> 01:29:21.040 align:start position:0%
campaign was able to use AI to create um
 
01:29:23.470 --> 01:29:23.480 align:start position:0%
electronically generated or artificially
 
01:29:28.149 --> 01:29:28.159 align:start position:0%
generated voice um campaign uh
 
01:29:30.590 --> 01:29:30.600 align:start position:0%
information um to gen or to get out to
 
01:29:32.709 --> 01:29:32.719 align:start position:0%
the public um so that he was able to
 
01:29:34.270 --> 01:29:34.280 align:start position:0%
effectively run a campaign so that's
 
01:29:37.270 --> 01:29:37.280 align:start position:0%
just one example um that I have seen of
 
01:29:40.830 --> 01:29:40.840 align:start position:0%
a of a use of AI that this bill would
 
01:29:45.350 --> 01:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
criminalize um or prohibit um that could
 
01:29:48.550 --> 01:29:48.560 align:start position:0%
in fact be utilized in the future and um
 
01:29:50.910 --> 01:29:50.920 align:start position:0%
on on those grounds uh I would say Free
 
01:29:54.390 --> 01:29:54.400 align:start position:0%
Speech grounds um I I will oppose that I
 
01:29:56.830 --> 01:29:56.840 align:start position:0%
I will I will support the itl thank you
 
01:29:58.430 --> 01:29:58.440 align:start position:0%
further discussion on the most spe legis
 
01:30:00.470 --> 01:30:00.480 align:start position:0%
repres BR you recognized thank you Mr
 
01:30:05.669 --> 01:30:05.679 align:start position:0%
chair um this bill does not explicitly
 
01:30:07.950 --> 01:30:07.960 align:start position:0%
criminalize the use of artificial
 
01:30:11.270 --> 01:30:11.280 align:start position:0%
intelligence in fact the bill that was
 
01:30:14.669 --> 01:30:14.679 align:start position:0%
passed in judiciary 20 to nothing on
 
01:30:18.550 --> 01:30:18.560 align:start position:0%
consent explicitly criminalizes the use
 
01:30:21.470 --> 01:30:21.480 align:start position:0%
of artificial intelligence this simply
 
01:30:24.590 --> 01:30:24.600 align:start position:0%
provides an Avenue for complaint an
 
01:30:27.470 --> 01:30:27.480 align:start position:0%
Avenue for injunction and it is solely
 
01:30:29.990 --> 01:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
related to 90 days before a candidate
 
01:30:33.870 --> 01:30:33.880 align:start position:0%
appears on a ballot and has to do
 
01:30:38.149 --> 01:30:38.159 align:start position:0%
explicitly with deep fakes fraudulent
 
01:30:41.990 --> 01:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
deep fakes deceptive manipulated deep
 
01:30:45.790 --> 01:30:45.800 align:start position:0%
fakes it is not if the candidate
 
01:30:49.270 --> 01:30:49.280 align:start position:0%
themselves is um putting forward
 
01:30:52.430 --> 01:30:52.440 align:start position:0%
artificial intelligence that they
 
01:30:55.149 --> 01:30:55.159 align:start position:0%
support um that is simply getting across
 
01:30:57.390 --> 01:30:57.400 align:start position:0%
their message when they are unable the
 
01:31:02.510 --> 01:31:02.520 align:start position:0%
purpose of this is not to um
 
01:31:06.189 --> 01:31:06.199 align:start position:0%
inhibit technological advances this is
 
01:31:09.629 --> 01:31:09.639 align:start position:0%
simply to protect our
 
01:31:13.750 --> 01:31:13.760 align:start position:0%
voters our candidates from being
 
01:31:13.760 --> 01:31:15.629 align:start position:0%
voters our candidates from being
fraudulently

01:31:15.629 --> 01:31:15.639 align:start position:0%
fraudulently
 
01:31:19.709 --> 01:31:19.719 align:start position:0%
deceptively manipulated by technology to
 
01:31:23.189 --> 01:31:23.199 align:start position:0%
relay uh to make them to make voters
 
01:31:25.590 --> 01:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
believe something something happened
 
01:31:29.030 --> 01:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
that did not actually occur in real
 
01:31:33.510 --> 01:31:33.520 align:start position:0%
life that's what this bill does so if
 
01:31:36.470 --> 01:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
you have a problem with explicit
 
01:31:38.430 --> 01:31:38.440 align:start position:0%
criminalization of artificial
 
01:31:41.149 --> 01:31:41.159 align:start position:0%
intelligence I would imagine that you
 
01:31:44.149 --> 01:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
might want to pull that Judiciary bill
 
01:31:47.870 --> 01:31:47.880 align:start position:0%
off consent and argue against it um that
 
01:31:50.470 --> 01:31:50.480 align:start position:0%
bill has bipartisan support and the
 
01:31:53.470 --> 01:31:53.480 align:start position:0%
language from that bill the definitions
 
01:31:56.390 --> 01:31:56.400 align:start position:0%
from that that bill are now included in
 
01:31:56.400 --> 01:31:57.149 align:start position:0%
from that that bill are now included in
this

01:31:57.149 --> 01:31:57.159 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:32:00.390 --> 01:32:00.400 align:start position:0%
bill and this has bipartisan language in
 
01:32:02.430 --> 01:32:02.440 align:start position:0%
it supported
 
01:32:05.870 --> 01:32:05.880 align:start position:0%
by and encouraged by and reached
 
01:32:10.149 --> 01:32:10.159 align:start position:0%
consensus by chairman Lynn and Judiciary
 
01:32:12.030 --> 01:32:12.040 align:start position:0%
as well as other members who were
 
01:32:14.990 --> 01:32:15.000 align:start position:0%
present at the meeting of the AI bills
 
01:32:16.470 --> 01:32:16.480 align:start position:0%
just last
 
01:32:20.470 --> 01:32:20.480 align:start position:0%
week so I'm particularly
 
01:32:22.830 --> 01:32:22.840 align:start position:0%
confused why this
 
01:32:26.750 --> 01:32:26.760 align:start position:0%
committee would be voting against this
 
01:32:30.229 --> 01:32:30.239 align:start position:0%
bill when this is the only opportunity
 
01:32:33.270 --> 01:32:33.280 align:start position:0%
we have to put something on the books to
 
01:32:36.149 --> 01:32:36.159 align:start position:0%
give law enforcement the AG's office the
 
01:32:39.149 --> 01:32:39.159 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State a tool in their
 
01:32:43.270 --> 01:32:43.280 align:start position:0%
toolbox to make a change
 
01:32:47.350 --> 01:32:47.360 align:start position:0%
to to stop the dissemination of
 
01:32:49.470 --> 01:32:49.480 align:start position:0%
disinformation during this critical
 
01:32:52.830 --> 01:32:52.840 align:start position:0%
election year and this is not a
 
01:32:54.590 --> 01:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
Republican or Democrat ratic thing this
 
01:32:57.229 --> 01:32:57.239 align:start position:0%
is this is a bipartisan thing there's
 
01:33:00.270 --> 01:33:00.280 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support for this bill so I'm
 
01:33:02.310 --> 01:33:02.320 align:start position:0%
I'm particularly confused and I would
 
01:33:05.310 --> 01:33:05.320 align:start position:0%
love an explanation if anyone would care
 
01:33:08.030 --> 01:33:08.040 align:start position:0%
to provide one to me why suddenly this
 
01:33:10.030 --> 01:33:10.040 align:start position:0%
is getting
 
01:33:13.030 --> 01:33:13.040 align:start position:0%
um the treatment it's getting thank you
 
01:33:14.270 --> 01:33:14.280 align:start position:0%
further discussion on the motion of in
 
01:33:17.629 --> 01:33:17.639 align:start position:0%
speing to legislate on House Bill
 
01:33:20.470 --> 01:33:20.480 align:start position:0%
1596 venberg so I think we're in a
 
01:33:22.550 --> 01:33:22.560 align:start position:0%
position where it's much more likely
 
01:33:25.870 --> 01:33:25.880 align:start position:0%
that if we're focused on dissemination
 
01:33:30.430 --> 01:33:30.440 align:start position:0%
of um content that the um social media
 
01:33:32.189 --> 01:33:32.199 align:start position:0%
companies and platforms have been
 
01:33:33.910 --> 01:33:33.920 align:start position:0%
looking into updating their terms of
 
01:33:37.709 --> 01:33:37.719 align:start position:0%
service that would potentially constrain
 
01:33:39.310 --> 01:33:39.320 align:start position:0%
some of this in some way that would not
 
01:33:42.790 --> 01:33:42.800 align:start position:0%
be a legal setting or a legal standard
 
01:33:46.510 --> 01:33:46.520 align:start position:0%
where um you know once you once you
 
01:33:48.229 --> 01:33:48.239 align:start position:0%
accept those terms of services anybody
 
01:33:50.470 --> 01:33:50.480 align:start position:0%
that's ended up in Facebook jail or you
 
01:33:52.990 --> 01:33:53.000 align:start position:0%
know um similar situations will tell you
 
01:33:54.550 --> 01:33:54.560 align:start position:0%
those could be much more onerous than
 
01:33:57.870 --> 01:33:57.880 align:start position:0%
having um and probably the way to go at
 
01:33:59.990 --> 01:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
this point rather than having um
 
01:34:01.750 --> 01:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
government step in and create an extra
 
01:34:04.229 --> 01:34:04.239 align:start position:0%
layer of legislation that could
 
01:34:06.350 --> 01:34:06.360 align:start position:0%
potentially infringe on free speech and
 
01:34:09.030 --> 01:34:09.040 align:start position:0%
I'd also add that um having somebody
 
01:34:13.950 --> 01:34:13.960 align:start position:0%
declare um their opinions or um content
 
01:34:17.590 --> 01:34:17.600 align:start position:0%
as satire or any any other way um I I
 
01:34:19.590 --> 01:34:19.600 align:start position:0%
don't think that's really I don't think
 
01:34:21.109 --> 01:34:21.119 align:start position:0%
that's really effective when if they
 
01:34:22.910 --> 01:34:22.920 align:start position:0%
were going to if this content was going
 
01:34:24.430 --> 01:34:24.440 align:start position:0%
to be used in a way to affect an
 
01:34:26.709 --> 01:34:26.719 align:start position:0%
election that would have to be um you
 
01:34:28.430 --> 01:34:28.440 align:start position:0%
know there' have to be disclaimers and
 
01:34:30.950 --> 01:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
that would fall under current law um so
 
01:34:32.189 --> 01:34:32.199 align:start position:0%
I don't think I don't think this bill is
 
01:34:34.350 --> 01:34:34.360 align:start position:0%
needed I think it's I think it's early
 
01:34:36.510 --> 01:34:36.520 align:start position:0%
in the process we we don't really know
 
01:34:38.310 --> 01:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
what situations we might encounter and
 
01:34:39.669 --> 01:34:39.679 align:start position:0%
therefore trying
 
01:34:42.430 --> 01:34:42.440 align:start position:0%
to legislate pre- crime I I don't think
 
01:34:44.870 --> 01:34:44.880 align:start position:0%
that's really effective
 
01:34:47.430 --> 01:34:47.440 align:start position:0%
thank representative Lane
 
01:34:50.270 --> 01:34:50.280 align:start position:0%
recognized thank you Mr chair I would
 
01:34:53.070 --> 01:34:53.080 align:start position:0%
Echo um everything that representative
 
01:34:55.750 --> 01:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
uh Brennan uh expressed
 
01:34:59.430 --> 01:34:59.440 align:start position:0%
eloquently um this would not uh affect
 
01:35:02.430 --> 01:35:02.440 align:start position:0%
free free speech if it's free speech and
 
01:35:04.629 --> 01:35:04.639 align:start position:0%
it's the person doing it and there are
 
01:35:06.550 --> 01:35:06.560 align:start position:0%
very certain rules about what the First
 
01:35:09.669 --> 01:35:09.679 align:start position:0%
Amendment covers it's not unlimited but
 
01:35:12.310 --> 01:35:12.320 align:start position:0%
particularly in a political situation
 
01:35:15.750 --> 01:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
our like you said our existing statutes
 
01:35:19.550 --> 01:35:19.560 align:start position:0%
should handle it um but there are
 
01:35:21.750 --> 01:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
circumstances where there will be fraud
 
01:35:24.070 --> 01:35:24.080 align:start position:0%
we've already had some one which would
 
01:35:26.510 --> 01:35:26.520 align:start position:0%
have been covered by the statute but I
 
01:35:28.070 --> 01:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
think we need to look forward and
 
01:35:30.950 --> 01:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
realize that this is something that's
 
01:35:34.590 --> 01:35:34.600 align:start position:0%
looming and is uh people are sounding
 
01:35:37.149 --> 01:35:37.159 align:start position:0%
the alarm and this just gives people the
 
01:35:40.350 --> 01:35:40.360 align:start position:0%
tools to do it and if people don't want
 
01:35:42.470 --> 01:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
to do it I mean if people want to do it
 
01:35:45.390 --> 01:35:45.400 align:start position:0%
and test the waters that's on them but I
 
01:35:50.430 --> 01:35:50.440 align:start position:0%
think we need to make sure that uh we
 
01:35:53.149 --> 01:35:53.159 align:start position:0%
don't have a lot of deep fakes going
 
01:35:55.470 --> 01:35:55.480 align:start position:0%
around for this election because it's
 
01:35:57.229 --> 01:35:57.239 align:start position:0%
going to be contentious and it's going
 
01:35:59.790 --> 01:35:59.800 align:start position:0%
to be difficult and I'd like to see
 
01:36:01.790 --> 01:36:01.800 align:start position:0%
something in place frankly to keep both
 
01:36:02.990 --> 01:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
sides reigned
 
01:36:04.950 --> 01:36:04.960 align:start position:0%

01:36:07.950 --> 01:36:07.960 align:start position:0%

for the ought to pass as amended report
 
01:37:02.070 --> 01:37:02.080 align:start position:0%
uh with that I will close the executive
 
01:37:04.550 --> 01:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
session on House Bill 1596 we'll take up
 
01:37:05.669 --> 01:37:05.679 align:start position:0%
our last piece of business which is
 
01:37:08.070 --> 01:37:08.080 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1091 representative Lane
 
01:37:10.669 --> 01:37:10.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:13.390 --> 01:37:13.400 align:start position:0%
we well like I said I I haven't gotten
 
01:37:15.870 --> 01:37:15.880 align:start position:0%
all the way through it um I I just need
 
01:37:18.629 --> 01:37:18.639 align:start position:0%
I probably need like 20 minutes just to
 
01:37:20.669 --> 01:37:20.679 align:start position:0%
go through the rest of it and make sure
 
01:37:23.070 --> 01:37:23.080 align:start position:0%
that all the changes got in I and I
 
01:37:25.270 --> 01:37:25.280 align:start position:0%
don't know if rep qu's had an
 
01:37:28.070 --> 01:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity to go through it yeah I hate
 
01:37:30.790 --> 01:37:30.800 align:start position:0%
to make everybody wait and then we could
 
01:37:32.790 --> 01:37:32.800 align:start position:0%
try and do it before lunch
 
01:37:38.310 --> 01:37:38.320 align:start position:0%
but um yeah so I think here's what we do
 
01:37:40.350 --> 01:37:40.360 align:start position:0%
um because I'm going to have there
 
01:37:41.910 --> 01:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
already are a few changes so it's
 
01:37:43.790 --> 01:37:43.800 align:start position:0%
already going to have to go back cor
 
01:37:45.390 --> 01:37:45.400 align:start position:0%
correct so that's where that and that's
 
01:37:47.709 --> 01:37:47.719 align:start position:0%
where I'm getting to my point yeah
 
01:37:51.510 --> 01:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
is we have to act on this bill today um
 
01:37:54.229 --> 01:37:54.239 align:start position:0%
I want to get it as close to
 
01:37:56.390 --> 01:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
right as possible understanding that we
 
01:37:59.310 --> 01:37:59.320 align:start position:0%
will probably miss something so
 
01:38:00.189 --> 01:38:00.199 align:start position:0%
understanding that we will probably
 
01:38:03.510 --> 01:38:03.520 align:start position:0%
catch something in the next week and a
 
01:38:07.189 --> 01:38:07.199 align:start position:0%
half um in fact I would put money down
 
01:38:08.310 --> 01:38:08.320 align:start position:0%
that we will catch something in the next
 
01:38:11.910 --> 01:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
week and a half um let's do this we're
 
01:38:13.189 --> 01:38:13.199 align:start position:0%
going to have to bring a floor Amendment
 
01:38:15.470 --> 01:38:15.480 align:start position:0%
anyways I think we're at that
 
01:38:18.750 --> 01:38:18.760 align:start position:0%
stage um to clean it up and I hate floor
 
01:38:20.109 --> 01:38:20.119 align:start position:0%
amendments and I know you hate floor
 
01:38:21.990 --> 01:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
amendments I hate them so much I hate
 
01:38:24.229 --> 01:38:24.239 align:start position:0%
them so much especially on a 13 page
 
01:38:27.310 --> 01:38:27.320 align:start position:0%
Bill correct but I think that's I think
 
01:38:29.870 --> 01:38:29.880 align:start position:0%
that's where we're at because even if we
 
01:38:32.990 --> 01:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
get even if we get it up to OS and get
 
01:38:34.270 --> 01:38:34.280 align:start position:0%
it back we're still going to have to
 
01:38:35.350 --> 01:38:35.360 align:start position:0%
we're still going to find something and
 
01:38:36.189 --> 01:38:36.199 align:start position:0%
we're still going to bring a floor
 
01:38:39.270 --> 01:38:39.280 align:start position:0%
Amendment so let's I I think instead of
 
01:38:41.589 --> 01:38:41.599 align:start position:0%
trying to get the amendment in front of
 
01:38:44.629 --> 01:38:44.639 align:start position:0%
us perfect my recommendation is we pass
 
01:38:47.030 --> 01:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
the amendment that's in front of us I
 
01:38:50.310 --> 01:38:50.320 align:start position:0%
will be voting otpa just for disclosure
 
01:38:51.709 --> 01:38:51.719 align:start position:0%
and then representative Lane will bring
 
01:38:53.870 --> 01:38:53.880 align:start position:0%
forward a floor Amendment together I'll
 
01:38:55.750 --> 01:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
put my name on it and that will
 
01:38:57.709 --> 01:38:57.719 align:start position:0%
hopefully what little what little good
 
01:38:59.790 --> 01:38:59.800 align:start position:0%
favor I have with my side of the aisle
 
01:39:01.270 --> 01:39:01.280 align:start position:0%
um that will help and what favor you
 
01:39:02.709 --> 01:39:02.719 align:start position:0%
have with your side of the aisle will
 
01:39:04.790 --> 01:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
help um and I think we'll be able to get
 
01:39:08.109 --> 01:39:08.119 align:start position:0%
the floor Amendment through um but
 
01:39:09.510 --> 01:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
that's I think that's where we're at
 
01:39:10.629 --> 01:39:10.639 align:start position:0%
because otherwise we would probably be
 
01:39:13.270 --> 01:39:13.280 align:start position:0%
here till 4 o'clock um oh I don't think
 
01:39:14.990 --> 01:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
so because the changes are no the
 
01:39:16.910 --> 01:39:16.920 align:start position:0%
changes are small and she said she would
 
01:39:19.790 --> 01:39:19.800 align:start position:0%
put it to the top of her list okay and
 
01:39:22.550 --> 01:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
you know I think if if I can just get 20
 
01:39:24.550 --> 01:39:24.560 align:start position:0%
minutes to do it get it over to her I
 
01:39:26.149 --> 01:39:26.159 align:start position:0%
mean if we take a lunch break and come
 
01:39:27.830 --> 01:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
back at 1 we should have it all right is
 
01:39:29.709 --> 01:39:29.719 align:start position:0%
there any I know there are some members
 
01:39:31.709 --> 01:39:31.719 align:start position:0%
that have ha ask I just hate to ask
 
01:39:33.990 --> 01:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
people to vote for something that you
 
01:39:37.870 --> 01:39:37.880 align:start position:0%
know are changes and that it's not what
 
01:39:39.990 --> 01:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
um we all want and I just don't think
 
01:39:42.229 --> 01:39:42.239 align:start position:0%
that's a good way to do something
 
01:39:44.350 --> 01:39:44.360 align:start position:0%
especially when the subcommittee works
 
01:39:47.270 --> 01:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
so hard on this so okay that's is there
 
01:39:48.390 --> 01:39:48.400 align:start position:0%
I I know there members that have to
 
01:39:52.310 --> 01:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
leave so who has to
 
01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:55.350 align:start position:0%
leave so who has to
leave

01:39:55.350 --> 01:39:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:58.229 --> 01:39:58.239 align:start position:0%
anyone does anyone else need to leave
 
01:39:59.830 --> 01:39:59.840 align:start position:0%
it's okay if you do it's not the end of
 
01:40:02.430 --> 01:40:02.440 align:start position:0%
the world um I'm just trying to figure
 
01:40:06.229 --> 01:40:06.239 align:start position:0%
it out okay so I think we'll do that um
 
01:40:07.350 --> 01:40:07.360 align:start position:0%
represent Lane so you'll have an
 
01:40:09.070 --> 01:40:09.080 align:start position:0%
amendment for us ready to go at let's
 
01:40:11.709 --> 01:40:11.719 align:start position:0%
say you have to leave at 130 represent
 
01:40:15.510 --> 01:40:15.520 align:start position:0%
girl so let's reconvene at 1:5 give us
 
01:40:19.750 --> 01:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
the longest run on that as possible um
 
01:40:23.910 --> 01:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
and we'll get it done um okay uh yes
 
01:40:26.070 --> 01:40:26.080 align:start position:0%
representative qule you want to turn
 
01:40:27.709 --> 01:40:27.719 align:start position:0%
turn on your microphone just we're still
 
01:40:31.589 --> 01:40:31.599 align:start position:0%
yes if representative Lanes uh does not
 
01:40:33.790 --> 01:40:33.800 align:start position:0%
get her changes back from OS by that
 
01:40:35.589 --> 01:40:35.599 align:start position:0%
time yeah I think we should just go
 
01:40:38.109 --> 01:40:38.119 align:start position:0%
ahead and follow your your thought of
 
01:40:39.629 --> 01:40:39.639 align:start position:0%
passing this amendment and then fixing
 
01:40:41.149 --> 01:40:41.159 align:start position:0%
it with the floor amendment is
 
01:40:43.270 --> 01:40:43.280 align:start position:0%
distasteful as that might be yes I'm not
 
01:40:45.270 --> 01:40:45.280 align:start position:0%
a huge I I share the animosity towards a
 
01:40:46.310 --> 01:40:46.320 align:start position:0%
floor amend so I'm just trying to be
 
01:40:49.709 --> 01:40:49.719 align:start position:0%
respectful of the memb time um I think
 
01:40:51.229 --> 01:40:51.239 align:start position:0%
that would be just an alternative in
 
01:40:53.470 --> 01:40:53.480 align:start position:0%
case her is that is that okay okay with
 
01:40:54.550 --> 01:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
01:40:57.149 --> 01:40:57.159 align:start position:0%
Lane I know it's not ideal but we're in
 
01:40:58.870 --> 01:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
an unideal situation and we're trying to
 
01:41:01.149 --> 01:41:01.159 align:start position:0%
make the best of it it it it sounds as
 
01:41:03.750 --> 01:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
though the uh the items she's finding
 
01:41:05.229 --> 01:41:05.239 align:start position:0%
and I'll spend the next hour or so
 
01:41:07.510 --> 01:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
looking through it too okay but uh
 
01:41:08.950 --> 01:41:08.960 align:start position:0%
sounds like the thing she's talking
 
01:41:10.470 --> 01:41:10.480 align:start position:0%
about changing are pretty minor and
 
01:41:12.790 --> 01:41:12.800 align:start position:0%
could be easily explained on the floor
 
01:41:14.669 --> 01:41:14.679 align:start position:0%
okay so let's come back at 1:00
 
01:41:16.470 --> 01:41:16.480 align:start position:0%
hopefully we're done by then um we're
 
01:41:19.310 --> 01:41:19.320 align:start position:0%
going to vote by5 so um I'm not saying
 
01:41:20.709 --> 01:41:20.719 align:start position:0%
we will vote we might vote earlier than
 
01:41:23.390 --> 01:41:23.400 align:start position:0%
that but if we get to 115 and we we're
 
01:41:25.510 --> 01:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
not ready we're going to we're going to
 
01:41:25.520 --> 01:41:26.550 align:start position:0%
not ready we're going to we're going to
vote

01:41:26.550 --> 01:41:26.560 align:start position:0%

to come back we're waiting for them to
 
03:15:05.349 --> 03:15:05.359 align:start position:0%
print it we have it right it's done
 
03:15:07.790 --> 03:15:07.800 align:start position:0%
right so yeah so they're printing it um
 
03:15:10.110 --> 03:15:10.120 align:start position:0%
so before we make a 91a violation we
 
03:15:11.590 --> 03:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
were discussing the amendment I said
 
03:15:13.630 --> 03:15:13.640 align:start position:0%
it's time to bring we need to have those
 
03:15:17.110 --> 03:15:17.120 align:start position:0%
discussions in public so um there
 
03:15:19.910 --> 03:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
concern well C you want to speak to your
 
03:15:21.630 --> 03:15:21.640 align:start position:0%
concern you want to speak to your
 
03:15:23.990 --> 03:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
concern about election cycle page 20
 
03:15:24.000 --> 03:15:24.830 align:start position:0%
concern about election cycle page 20
line

03:15:24.830 --> 03:15:24.840 align:start position:0%
line
 
03:15:27.189 --> 03:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
27 sure yeah
 
03:15:29.790 --> 03:15:29.800 align:start position:0%
sure yes on page four of the amendment
 
03:15:34.710 --> 03:15:34.720 align:start position:0%
as it presently stands on uh where is it
 
03:15:38.309 --> 03:15:38.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:42.710 --> 03:15:42.720 align:start position:0%
27 uh item Roman numeral 23 election
 
03:15:44.349 --> 03:15:44.359 align:start position:0%
cycle means the period of time beginning
 
03:15:47.750 --> 03:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
on the eth day after a state general
 
03:15:50.750 --> 03:15:50.760 align:start position:0%
election through 21 days after the next
 
03:15:53.830 --> 03:15:53.840 align:start position:0%
state general election that implies an
 
03:15:58.070 --> 03:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
overlap between two successive election
 
03:16:00.750 --> 03:16:00.760 align:start position:0%
Cycles now I I think that could work but
 
03:16:04.389 --> 03:16:04.399 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if that's was
 
03:16:07.189 --> 03:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
the okay that wasn't the intent I think
 
03:16:09.950 --> 03:16:09.960 align:start position:0%
when we talked about it so
 
03:16:12.590 --> 03:16:12.600 align:start position:0%
um so I I missed that it didn't get
 
03:16:15.229 --> 03:16:15.239 align:start position:0%
changed we'll we'll fix that in a flam
 
03:16:18.990 --> 03:16:19.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:20.750 --> 03:16:20.760 align:start position:0%
start calling it The flam it's way more
 
03:16:25.389 --> 03:16:25.399 align:start position:0%
it's way more appealing than Flor M flam
 
03:16:27.750 --> 03:16:27.760 align:start position:0%
it could be fancy but like FL and the
 
03:16:29.229 --> 03:16:29.239 align:start position:0%
other thing that was brought to our
 
03:16:32.429 --> 03:16:32.439 align:start position:0%
attention is that with the date changed
 
03:16:34.750 --> 03:16:34.760 align:start position:0%
to the election cycle that starts on
 
03:16:36.429 --> 03:16:36.439 align:start position:0%
November 26
 
03:16:40.269 --> 03:16:40.279 align:start position:0%
2024 the effective date of the bill
 
03:16:43.309 --> 03:16:43.319 align:start position:0%
cannot be January 1 2025 so we're going
 
03:16:45.349 --> 03:16:45.359 align:start position:0%
to probably change that in the what did
 
03:16:47.510 --> 03:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
you call it the FL the FL I'm being
 
03:16:50.750 --> 03:16:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:53.710 --> 03:16:53.720 align:start position:0%
flam we can set it on fire yeah maybe we
 
03:16:55.910 --> 03:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
should go with flam then um we could get
 
03:16:58.950 --> 03:16:58.960 align:start position:0%
the bay really excited okay so November
 
03:17:03.030 --> 03:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
26 2024 to TI to that date okay so have
 
03:17:05.349 --> 03:17:05.359 align:start position:0%
to fix that you can't have it can't go
 
03:17:07.030 --> 03:17:07.040 align:start position:0%
backwards all right where are we with
 
03:17:09.349 --> 03:17:09.359 align:start position:0%
the printing do we know it's a Christina
 
03:17:11.870 --> 03:17:11.880 align:start position:0%
went to to print it
 
03:17:14.070 --> 03:17:14.080 align:start position:0%
okay um well tell you what we can do
 
03:17:15.910 --> 03:17:15.920 align:start position:0%
some procedural stuff and at least bang
 
03:17:19.389 --> 03:17:19.399 align:start position:0%
that out of the way um so we were on a
 
03:17:22.790 --> 03:17:22.800 align:start position:0%
motion of op to pass as amended on the
 
03:17:25.670 --> 03:17:25.680 align:start position:0%
