00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
static in the background
 
00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:12.080 align:start position:0%
and before we start i wanted to point
 
00:08:14.869 --> 00:08:14.879 align:start position:0%
out that today is the 11th of september
 
00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:18.240 align:start position:0%
the 19th anniversary of the world's
 
00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:21.360 align:start position:0%
worst terrorist attack on our soil
 
00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:23.280 align:start position:0%
i would like to start with a minute of
 
00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
silence for the almost 3 000 lives
 
00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:28.800 align:start position:0%
and 25 000 injured in that attack many
 
00:08:38.829 --> 00:08:38.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:38.839 --> 00:09:06.829 align:start position:0%
 
damages

00:09:06.829 --> 00:09:06.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:06.839 --> 00:09:16.070 align:start position:0%
 
this

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm sure everyone remembers
 
00:09:20.949 --> 00:09:20.959 align:start position:0%
where they were
 
00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:24.720 align:start position:0%
when that happened i was on the way into
 
00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:25.760 align:start position:0%
concord for
 
00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:35.720 align:start position:0%
so now we will proceed with
 
00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
117 increasing exemptions
 
00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:41.680 align:start position:0%
under the interest and dividends tax and
 
00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:44.240 align:start position:0%
decreasing the total amount of research
 
00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
and development tax credits
 
00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:50.800 align:start position:0%
against business taxes on
 
00:09:53.829 --> 00:09:53.839 align:start position:0%
representative uh
 
00:09:57.269 --> 00:09:57.279 align:start position:0%
no on i was actually going to
 
00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
make a motion for this one
 
00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:04.160 align:start position:0%
on and but we're in work session
 
00:10:07.829 --> 00:10:07.839 align:start position:0%
first i'd forgotten so
 
00:10:12.069 --> 00:10:12.079 align:start position:0%
does anybody have anything
 
00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
to to
 
00:10:19.829 --> 00:10:19.839 align:start position:0%
bring up about this bill we've
 
00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
we put it off last year
 
00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:28.480 align:start position:0%
and this year covid has
 
00:10:30.069 --> 00:10:30.079 align:start position:0%
really killed anything that we might
 
00:10:32.389 --> 00:10:32.399 align:start position:0%
have done about it so
 
00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:36.160 align:start position:0%
um representative brahmay
 
00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:39.200 align:start position:0%
uh has his physical hand up i think
 
00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:42.240 align:start position:0%
here yes yes i do
 
00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:45.680 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
00:10:48.069 --> 00:10:48.079 align:start position:0%
um the republican caucus had a
 
00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
discussion on this
 
00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
on this bill and uh we think that we
 
00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:54.720 align:start position:0%
should move
 
00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
for consideration for legislation for
 
00:10:58.870 --> 00:10:58.880 align:start position:0%
next year or a similar bill
 
00:11:02.389 --> 00:11:02.399 align:start position:0%
um we feel it's been a long time since
 
00:11:04.389 --> 00:11:04.399 align:start position:0%
the exemptions have been
 
00:11:07.509 --> 00:11:07.519 align:start position:0%
increased and that we we feel that
 
00:11:10.069 --> 00:11:10.079 align:start position:0%
even even with the virus and lower
 
00:11:10.079 --> 00:11:11.110 align:start position:0%
even even with the virus and lower
revenues

00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
00:11:14.949 --> 00:11:14.959 align:start position:0%
we could even put a date out certain uh
 
00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
for the potential reduction in revenue
 
00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:18.470 align:start position:0%
for the potential reduction in revenue
but

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
if the bill includes the reduction in
 
00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:22.160 align:start position:0%
the r d tax credits that should cover
 
00:11:23.829 --> 00:11:23.839 align:start position:0%
that anyway
 
00:11:28.389 --> 00:11:28.399 align:start position:0%
so um we still support the concept
 
00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:32.720 align:start position:0%
as a caucus thank you
 
00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
and from our side
 
00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
we had um decided tentatively that we
 
00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:42.069 align:start position:0%
we had um decided tentatively that we
would

00:11:42.069 --> 00:11:42.079 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:45.680 align:start position:0%
would want to recommend not recommend
 
00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:50.480 align:start position:0%
for further legislation on this
 
00:11:54.389 --> 00:11:54.399 align:start position:0%
tax covers an unknown number of people
 
00:11:54.399 --> 00:11:55.430 align:start position:0%
tax covers an unknown number of people
who

00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
who
 
00:11:59.670 --> 00:11:59.680 align:start position:0%
could use that exemption on
 
00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:03.440 align:start position:0%
that are retired and very low income
 
00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
and but it also covers all of the
 
00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
wealthy people that it was originally
 
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:08.829 align:start position:0%
wealthy people that it was originally
developed

00:12:08.829 --> 00:12:08.839 align:start position:0%
developed
 
00:12:12.389 --> 00:12:12.399 align:start position:0%
to to uh tax
 
00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:16.720 align:start position:0%
um a 100 years ago on
 
00:12:20.389 --> 00:12:20.399 align:start position:0%
the dividends and the interests were
 
00:12:20.399 --> 00:12:20.790 align:start position:0%
the dividends and the interests were
both

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
both
 
00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
owned almost entirely by the very
 
00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:25.670 align:start position:0%
owned almost entirely by the very
wealthy

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
wealthy
 
00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
in the state and on
 
00:12:32.069 --> 00:12:32.079 align:start position:0%
for them this would be very little money
 
00:12:32.079 --> 00:12:32.470 align:start position:0%
for them this would be very little money
but

00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
for us with our revenues in very bad
 
00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:38.800 align:start position:0%
shape it could uh
 
00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
mean the difference between a lot of
 
00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:42.320 align:start position:0%
services that
 
00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:45.680 align:start position:0%
those people in the lower income
 
00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
brackets especially but the whole
 
00:12:50.829 --> 00:12:50.839 align:start position:0%
society needs
 
00:12:50.839 --> 00:12:53.190 align:start position:0%
society needs
um

00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:53.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:57.269 --> 00:12:57.279 align:start position:0%
and the and we also don't know what the
 
00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
effect of that could be on
 
00:13:03.509 --> 00:13:03.519 align:start position:0%
some of the smaller businesses that use
 
00:13:03.519 --> 00:13:04.069 align:start position:0%
some of the smaller businesses that use
the

00:13:04.069 --> 00:13:04.079 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:06.160 align:start position:0%
research and development tax credit
 
00:13:07.269 --> 00:13:07.279 align:start position:0%
though it is
 
00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:11.200 align:start position:0%
quite small for each business
 
00:13:14.949 --> 00:13:14.959 align:start position:0%
and um there we have not been
 
00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
able yet to get a realistic
 
00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
evaluation of that tax credit
 
00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
and we also haven't been able to find
 
00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
data to
 
00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
figure out how many people
 
00:13:30.949 --> 00:13:30.959 align:start position:0%
are in those two categories i mentioned
 
00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:33.200 align:start position:0%
for the interest and dividends tax
 
00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
the retired that are trying to live off
 
00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
of personal savings that they made
 
00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
and most of which is in
 
00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
interest and dividends and and the
 
00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
very wealthy for whom their interest in
 
00:13:53.509 --> 00:13:53.519 align:start position:0%
dividends is a small part of
 
00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:56.800 align:start position:0%
what revenue they bring in every year
 
00:14:00.829 --> 00:14:00.839 align:start position:0%
so and then there are also other
 
00:14:03.509 --> 00:14:03.519 align:start position:0%
um bills that
 
00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
could be under consideration in the
 
00:14:06.629 --> 00:14:06.639 align:start position:0%
future that
 
00:14:10.389 --> 00:14:10.399 align:start position:0%
would would um
 
00:14:13.509 --> 00:14:13.519 align:start position:0%
change these exemptions in the process
 
00:14:16.949 --> 00:14:16.959 align:start position:0%
of doing another tax reform
 
00:14:20.629 --> 00:14:20.639 align:start position:0%
so not a
 
00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
broad-based one but a
 
00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
a larger one than this contemplates
 
00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
so that is um
 
00:14:34.949 --> 00:14:34.959 align:start position:0%
that's been pretty much
 
00:14:36.949 --> 00:14:36.959 align:start position:0%
the way we felt on the other side of
 
00:14:38.629 --> 00:14:38.639 align:start position:0%
this i don't know whether anybody else
 
00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
wants to
 
00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
mr chairman representative lang i'm
 
00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:51.680 align:start position:0%
representative lang
 
00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
and i think yes
 
00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
go ahead obviously i have a vested
 
00:14:59.030 --> 00:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
interest in this bill
 
00:15:01.269 --> 00:15:01.279 align:start position:0%
um in that i was one of the sponsors of
 
00:15:03.189 --> 00:15:03.199 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor for this bill
 
00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:06.240 align:start position:0%
um one of the things i will say is that
 
00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:08.160 align:start position:0%
if if this bill is moved for
 
00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:09.590 align:start position:0%
if if this bill is moved for
recommendation

00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:12.720 align:start position:0%
uh going forward for further legislation
 
00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:15.440 align:start position:0%
i anticipate filing this bill but i
 
00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
would not do that
 
00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:20.560 align:start position:0%
until the second session of next year
 
00:15:22.389 --> 00:15:22.399 align:start position:0%
and the main reason being is so we
 
00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:24.320 align:start position:0%
wanted to recognize what the revenues
 
00:15:26.389 --> 00:15:26.399 align:start position:0%
would look like and the impact
 
00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
um but again i think that you know these
 
00:15:30.949 --> 00:15:30.959 align:start position:0%
are the kind of bills we want to see
 
00:15:33.189 --> 00:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
that are net zero to the state you know
 
00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
the idea being that
 
00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
while we're giving a tax break and
 
00:15:38.069 --> 00:15:38.079 align:start position:0%
allowing our citizens to be able to keep
 
00:15:39.829 --> 00:15:39.839 align:start position:0%
more income that they earn at the same
 
00:15:39.839 --> 00:15:40.629 align:start position:0%
more income that they earn at the same
time

00:15:40.629 --> 00:15:40.639 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
we're paying for that by pulling back on
 
00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:44.389 align:start position:0%
we're paying for that by pulling back on
subsidies

00:15:44.389 --> 00:15:44.399 align:start position:0%
subsidies
 
00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
for businesses that should be paying
 
00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
taxes so i think that
 
00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:49.680 align:start position:0%
you know this is the exact kind of bill
 
00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
we want to see in the future
 
00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
for moving forward if we're going to be
 
00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:54.720 align:start position:0%
lowering taxes is doing it with an
 
00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:55.430 align:start position:0%
lowering taxes is doing it with an
offset

00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
offset
 
00:15:57.350 --> 00:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
so that we see there's no impact
 
00:15:58.710 --> 00:15:58.720 align:start position:0%
potentially on on
 
00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
government services so i would hope that
 
00:16:03.749 --> 00:16:03.759 align:start position:0%
considering that we we'd be able to
 
00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
recommend that this legislation move
 
00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:06.870 align:start position:0%
recommend that this legislation move
forward

00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
in the future sessions and and i'll
 
00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:11.360 align:start position:0%

i'm trying to watch the side panel and
 
00:16:27.839 --> 00:16:28.389 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to watch the side panel and
half

00:16:28.389 --> 00:16:28.399 align:start position:0%
half
 
00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
of representatives bursting ames brownie
 
00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:48.720 align:start position:0%
okay am i yeah you hear me now yeah good
 
00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:49.350 align:start position:0%
okay am i yeah you hear me now yeah good
job

00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:49.360 align:start position:0%
job
 
00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
okay um yeah uh
 
00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
i think the half of this bill that uh
 
00:17:00.629 --> 00:17:00.639 align:start position:0%
that increases exemptions is
 
00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
is something that needs to happen
 
00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:07.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
to the tax credit the particular tax
 
00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:12.160 align:start position:0%
credit here
 
00:17:15.909 --> 00:17:15.919 align:start position:0%
in this bill um i
 
00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
i think is uh it's it's it that
 
00:17:23.029 --> 00:17:23.039 align:start position:0%
that linkage i think is uh
 
00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:26.640 align:start position:0%
is not ready for action and i think we
 
00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:28.400 align:start position:0%
need more information i think uh
 
00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:29.029 align:start position:0%
need more information i think uh
representative

00:17:29.029 --> 00:17:29.039 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
amy spoke to that um i think we're
 
00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:34.240 align:start position:0%
poorly informed on
 
00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:37.280 align:start position:0%
the degree to which that
 
00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
that tax credit is important i know that
 
00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:44.840 align:start position:0%
the the business and industries
 
00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:46.230 align:start position:0%
the the business and industries
association

00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:46.240 align:start position:0%
association
 
00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
i came to our hearing on this bill which
 
00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:50.480 align:start position:0%
was way back
 
00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
in late in 2019 i think
 
00:17:56.710 --> 00:17:56.720 align:start position:0%
uh yes who speak in opposition to the
 
00:17:58.390 --> 00:17:58.400 align:start position:0%
bill because
 
00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:00.720 align:start position:0%
they believe that the tax credit is
 
00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:01.510 align:start position:0%
they believe that the tax credit is
important

00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:04.640 align:start position:0%
um so um so
 
00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
i don't think going forward with a
 
00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:08.310 align:start position:0%
i don't think going forward with a
recommendation

00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:08.320 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
00:18:11.669 --> 00:18:11.679 align:start position:0%
that legislation has called for whatever
 
00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
the language is that
 
00:18:16.549 --> 00:18:16.559 align:start position:0%
that would be used is appropriate for
 
00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:17.440 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
in its current form and would
 
00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
definitely be looking at the possibility
 
00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
of linking the
 
00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
tax exemption
 
00:18:33.029 --> 00:18:33.039 align:start position:0%
changes that are needed in the ind
 
00:18:37.669 --> 00:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
tax to something else that would pay for
 
00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
those exemption changes
 
00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:47.200 align:start position:0%
thank you representative stringham has
 
00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um uh
 
00:18:57.830 --> 00:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
in general um you know i like the
 
00:18:59.750 --> 00:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
structure of the bill the fact that it's
 
00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:03.200 align:start position:0%
uh trying to be revenue neutral i do
 
00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
know the
 
00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
the r d uh tax credit program
 
00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
is um is important to remain
 
00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
as part of the state it is uh just
 
00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:15.440 align:start position:0%
having one is an incentive
 
00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:17.440 align:start position:0%
for certain businesses and so we have a
 
00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
checkbox that we have a program
 
00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:22.880 align:start position:0%
i do think there may not be much benefit
 
00:19:25.909 --> 00:19:25.919 align:start position:0%
to the program of having the program at
 
00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:28.480 align:start position:0%
2 million as opposed to 7 million
 
00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:33.280 align:start position:0%
so and i do think that the
 
00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
interest in dividend tax
 
00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:39.200 align:start position:0%
could use an increase in the exemption
 
00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:39.750 align:start position:0%
could use an increase in the exemption
so

00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
in general i do like the structure of
 
00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
this um
 
00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:45.280 align:start position:0%
you know overall you know i am concerned
 
00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
about uh the quoted recession the impact
 
00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:48.880 align:start position:0%
on the budget
 
00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:52.240 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
underfunded pension which exceeds five
 
00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
billion right now
 
00:19:59.110 --> 00:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
and uh in our efforts to restructure how
 
00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
we fund education
 
00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
uh and these are all this bill is a drop
 
00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
in the bucket compared to the
 
00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:08.320 align:start position:0%
size of the financial considerations
 
00:20:11.029 --> 00:20:11.039 align:start position:0%
hey jerry can you lean in closer to your
 
00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
microphone and it's really hard for me
 
00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:13.280 align:start position:0%
to hear
 
00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:16.720 align:start position:0%
 up okay well
 
00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:19.360 align:start position:0%
that was that was most i just said in
 
00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
general i agree with the structure of
 
00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
this i don't mind
 
00:20:25.669 --> 00:20:25.679 align:start position:0%
legislation going forward on either
 
00:20:26.549 --> 00:20:26.559 align:start position:0%
either year
 
00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh next term i i am certain that we
 
00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
would have to have
 
00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
more analysis to make sure that it's
 
00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:35.200 align:start position:0%
revenue neutral i like the fact that it
 
00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
it's offset i do think it's a small bill
 
00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
compared to
 
00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
major financial challenges that we will
 
00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:43.270 align:start position:0%
major financial challenges that we will
have

00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:43.280 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
uh in making more progress in pensions
 
00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
and uh and the changing role of how we
 
00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
fund education in the state
 
00:20:56.470 --> 00:20:56.480 align:start position:0%
that's they're my comments
 
00:20:58.789 --> 00:20:58.799 align:start position:0%
thank you representative oleri wants to
 
00:20:58.799 --> 00:21:01.190 align:start position:0%
thank you representative oleri wants to
talk

00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:04.640 align:start position:0%
yeah as people know i'm very reluctant
 
00:21:06.549 --> 00:21:06.559 align:start position:0%
to speak in public
 
00:21:10.549 --> 00:21:10.559 align:start position:0%
um if we're going to
 
00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:12.480 align:start position:0%
push this forward i would suggest that
 
00:21:14.149 --> 00:21:14.159 align:start position:0%
we do it for a first year bill
 
00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
so we could discuss it over the summer
 
00:21:17.669 --> 00:21:17.679 align:start position:0%
that's the only modification i would
 
00:21:17.679 --> 00:21:18.549 align:start position:0%
that's the only modification i would
make

00:21:18.549 --> 00:21:18.559 align:start position:0%
make
 
00:21:21.669 --> 00:21:21.679 align:start position:0%
how and when tim puts it forward it's
 
00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
it's up to him but uh this is a bill
 
00:21:27.909 --> 00:21:27.919 align:start position:0%
as is the other one worthy of
 
00:21:27.919 --> 00:21:29.110 align:start position:0%
as is the other one worthy of
considerable

00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
considerable
 
00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
discussion and doing it in a short
 
00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:32.720 align:start position:0%
period of time
 
00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:35.360 align:start position:0%
may not do either of those two bills
 
00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:36.470 align:start position:0%
may not do either of those two bills
justice

00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
justice
 
00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
i mean we have the option of deferring
 
00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:39.590 align:start position:0%
i mean we have the option of deferring
it

00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
or holding it for interim study so
 
00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
that's two cents thank you
 
00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:49.190 align:start position:0%
that's two cents thank you
bye

00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:53.669 --> 00:21:53.679 align:start position:0%
thank you well yeah i'm still on
 
00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
on we do
 
00:22:00.789 --> 00:22:00.799 align:start position:0%
know that the interest and dividends
 
00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
have increased considerably since 2016.
 
00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
the stock market is the only part of the
 
00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
economy that's happy at this point
 
00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:16.480 align:start position:0%
and in 2016 according to the fiscal note
 
00:22:18.789 --> 00:22:18.799 align:start position:0%
uh this would have cost us a little bit
 
00:22:20.149 --> 00:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
over a million dollars
 
00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
net so um or
 
00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
the exemption would have had to be cut
 
00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
down further
 
00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:31.280 align:start position:0%
we are still going to be in recession
 
00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:34.640 align:start position:0%
at least in a recession on our revenues
 
00:22:37.669 --> 00:22:37.679 align:start position:0%
and a recession probably in
 
00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
on our economy next year
 
00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
and so i welcome representatives
 
00:22:48.549 --> 00:22:48.559 align:start position:0%
lange's offer to put it in in the second
 
00:22:48.559 --> 00:22:49.350 align:start position:0%
lange's offer to put it in in the second
year

00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:49.360 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
when we have finished the major work
 
00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:54.640 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to do to try to
 
00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:56.320 align:start position:0%
figure out how to keep this government
 
00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:57.669 align:start position:0%
figure out how to keep this government
together

00:22:57.669 --> 00:22:57.679 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:01.440 align:start position:0%
in the first year and maybe moved around
 
00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
different parts of our tax structure i
 
00:23:04.549 --> 00:23:04.559 align:start position:0%
have no idea
 
00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
whether that is going to happen or not
 
00:23:11.909 --> 00:23:11.919 align:start position:0%
but on but we had to
 
00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:15.440 align:start position:0%
full with some of the adjust the number
 
00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
of revenue sources
 
00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
in the great recession and this one's
 
00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:22.470 align:start position:0%
in the great recession and this one's
worse

00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:22.480 align:start position:0%
worse
 
00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:24.400 align:start position:0%
so i don't know whether we're going to
 
00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
cut our government down
 
00:23:28.549 --> 00:23:28.559 align:start position:0%
into shreds with no safety net or we're
 
00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:29.440 align:start position:0%
going to
 
00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
find have to find revenues or whether
 
00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
the federal government will finally bail
 
00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:34.840 align:start position:0%
us out
 
00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:36.910 align:start position:0%
on so um
 
00:23:36.910 --> 00:23:38.149 align:start position:0%
on so um
[Music]

00:23:38.149 --> 00:23:38.159 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:23:40.789 --> 00:23:40.799 align:start position:0%
i think by the second year things should
 
00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
be more stable and we'll be able to
 
00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
to start to try to figure out where we
 
00:23:46.710 --> 00:23:46.720 align:start position:0%
are we'll also have i think
 
00:23:49.669 --> 00:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
some information by then from from the
 
00:23:49.679 --> 00:23:51.590 align:start position:0%
some information by then from from the
dra

00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
dra
 
00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
um we uh
 
00:23:58.950 --> 00:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:02.320 align:start position:0%
if ours if the
 
00:24:06.149 --> 00:24:06.159 align:start position:0%
issue of not recommended for further
 
00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
study passes then
 
00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:12.640 align:start position:0%
on or if it doesn't pass
 
00:24:15.669 --> 00:24:15.679 align:start position:0%
i would would like the alternative
 
00:24:17.669 --> 00:24:17.679 align:start position:0%
viewpoint to be included in the blurb
 
00:24:17.679 --> 00:24:17.990 align:start position:0%
viewpoint to be included in the blurb
because

00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
we're only allowed to write one blurb
 
00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
so um and
 
00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
as you know uh whatever we do now is not
 
00:24:30.390 --> 00:24:30.400 align:start position:0%
definitive for next year
 
00:24:33.269 --> 00:24:33.279 align:start position:0%
we could say we want to do this and the
 
00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
people who are here next year
 
00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
hate it or and and nobody puts it in
 
00:24:42.149 --> 00:24:42.159 align:start position:0%
or we could uh or
 
00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
we could say we don't want to do it and
 
00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
the people
 
00:24:48.549 --> 00:24:48.559 align:start position:0%
next term think okay this is a better
 
00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:50.240 align:start position:0%
idea than we thought even if they're the
 
00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
same people
 
00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
so um it's not definitive
 
00:24:58.070 --> 00:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
it's just a suggestion until next year
 
00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
but i personally would like to go ahead
 
00:25:04.549 --> 00:25:04.559 align:start position:0%
with making a recommendation since no
 
00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:06.400 align:start position:0%
one else wants to talk
 
00:25:10.149 --> 00:25:10.159 align:start position:0%
uh for uh not recommended for
 
00:25:13.269 --> 00:25:13.279 align:start position:0%
further for future legislation
 
00:25:16.789 --> 00:25:16.799 align:start position:0%
but within the blurb section
 
00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:20.400 align:start position:0%
saying that um that once the
 
00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
economic situation is stabilized
 
00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:26.240 align:start position:0%
uh that at least until the economic
 
00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:27.110 align:start position:0%
uh that at least until the economic
situation

00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:36.880 align:start position:0%
and but explaining from our side why
 
00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:44.549 --> 00:25:44.559 align:start position:0%
that we need to get a better idea
 
00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:47.360 align:start position:0%
of this tax credit which i think can be
 
00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:47.830 align:start position:0%
of this tax credit which i think can be
done

00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
without the bill in place
 
00:25:55.669 --> 00:25:55.679 align:start position:0%
on by the tax expenditure committee
 
00:25:57.269 --> 00:25:57.279 align:start position:0%
even though the senate cut it down to
 
00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:07.120 align:start position:0%
and hopefully by then we'll we'll have
 
00:26:10.390 --> 00:26:10.400 align:start position:0%
we'll be able to find something perhaps
 
00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:11.840 align:start position:0%
from a national level
 
00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
about on the distribution
 
00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:18.400 align:start position:0%
of income that is hit by this
 
00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
this peculiar tax that we have and other
 
00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:23.120 align:start position:0%
people don't
 
00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:26.240 align:start position:0%
so um that may be
 
00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
available in some of in itep or
 
00:26:31.909 --> 00:26:31.919 align:start position:0%
the tax foundation or somebody that
 
00:26:33.269 --> 00:26:33.279 align:start position:0%
could do it
 
00:26:37.350 --> 00:26:37.360 align:start position:0%
um so i would like to make the motion
 
00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:44.400 align:start position:0%
not recommended for further further
 
00:26:47.269 --> 00:26:47.279 align:start position:0%
legislation future legislation sorry
 
00:26:48.149 --> 00:26:48.159 align:start position:0%
that's the motion
 
00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:50.840 align:start position:0%
it's not recommended for future
 
00:26:52.130 --> 00:26:52.140 align:start position:0%
legislation um
 
00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:53.269 align:start position:0%
legislation um
[Music]

00:26:53.269 --> 00:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
and see where we are on a vote on that
 
00:27:01.909 --> 00:27:01.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:03.669 --> 00:27:03.679 align:start position:0%
from somebody that's not muted
 
00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
representative schamberg
 
00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:08.240 align:start position:0%
i second that motion madam chair i have
 
00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
a question uh
 
00:27:11.910 --> 00:27:11.920 align:start position:0%
uh uh of order
 
00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:13.190 align:start position:0%
uh uh of order
[Music]

00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
um it is uh whether we're in an
 
00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:16.960 align:start position:0%
executive session
 
00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:20.080 align:start position:0%
i think you said at the beginning
 
00:27:21.909 --> 00:27:21.919 align:start position:0%
jen do you know do we have to say
 
00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
specifically that we're in the executive
 
00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:25.510 align:start position:0%
specifically that we're in the executive
session

00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:25.520 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
i think it's it's helpful just to
 
00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:28.870 align:start position:0%
i think it's it's helpful just to
clarify

00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
from okay but there's no
 
00:27:34.549 --> 00:27:34.559 align:start position:0%
we've never done the two combined before
 
00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
we've always tried to wait a day
 
00:27:40.549 --> 00:27:40.559 align:start position:0%
at least uh so i'm calling us
 
00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:42.480 align:start position:0%
into executive session i don't think
 
00:27:44.549 --> 00:27:44.559 align:start position:0%
that does that require a roll call vote
 
00:27:45.669 --> 00:27:45.679 align:start position:0%
or something
 
00:27:49.909 --> 00:27:49.919 align:start position:0%
no good and i want to make the
 
00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
the motion of not recommended for
 
00:27:56.549 --> 00:27:56.559 align:start position:0%
future study for hb
 
00:27:59.590 --> 00:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
117 fn with my with the
 
00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
caveats i was mentioning so
 
00:28:04.789 --> 00:28:04.799 align:start position:0%
representative schamberg second set
 
00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:06.320 align:start position:0%
motion madam chair
 
00:28:10.389 --> 00:28:10.399 align:start position:0%
thank you so
 
00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:24.870 align:start position:0%
 
further

00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:30.880 align:start position:0%
you're still muted did it again i did it
 
00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:31.590 align:start position:0%
you're still muted did it again i did it
again

00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
i thought you know i made it myself that
 
00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:35.200 align:start position:0%
i muted myself
 
00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
well well when we went to executive
 
00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:38.320 align:start position:0%
session i'd muted
 
00:28:41.669 --> 00:28:41.679 align:start position:0%
but then anyway i i think i mean i agree
 
00:28:42.789 --> 00:28:42.799 align:start position:0%
with what you're saying
 
00:28:46.389 --> 00:28:46.399 align:start position:0%
uh i'm still going to vote the other way
 
00:28:49.269 --> 00:28:49.279 align:start position:0%
i understand you know even our caucus
 
00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
understands the fiscal situation we're
 
00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:52.230 align:start position:0%
understands the fiscal situation we're
in

00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:52.240 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:28:55.269 --> 00:28:55.279 align:start position:0%
and that uh if this bill does get move
 
00:28:56.830 --> 00:28:56.840 align:start position:0%
you know brought forth in the first
 
00:28:58.549 --> 00:28:58.559 align:start position:0%
session uh
 
00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
that we we've been looking closely at
 
00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:02.240 align:start position:0%
what the revenues look like
 
00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:04.640 align:start position:0%
we're not going to take any action if if
 
00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
we're really in a hole
 
00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
um i think it's safe to say but yeah i
 
00:29:09.669 --> 00:29:09.679 align:start position:0%
think we just want to make statement
 
00:29:10.549 --> 00:29:10.559 align:start position:0%
that we
 
00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
uh again this is all this really is it's
 
00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:14.320 align:start position:0%
making a statement i mean it's
 
00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:17.360 align:start position:0%
i mean if even if it's uh if it's
 
00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:19.840 align:start position:0%
uh you know more recommended you know
 
00:29:21.029 --> 00:29:21.039 align:start position:0%
recommended no
 
00:29:24.549 --> 00:29:24.559 align:start position:0%
someone can still file the bill so uh
 
00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:26.080 align:start position:0%
just so you know but we just want to
 
00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:27.200 align:start position:0%
make sure everybody understands that
 
00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:29.200 align:start position:0%
we're sensitive to
 
00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
the state of our revenues and that we'd
 
00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:32.720 align:start position:0%
be very cautious
 
00:29:35.269 --> 00:29:35.279 align:start position:0%
about you know and as as representative
 
00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:36.320 align:start position:0%
luery said
 
00:29:38.470 --> 00:29:38.480 align:start position:0%
even when we filed the first time we we
 
00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
could just
 
00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
interim study it and continue to monitor
 
00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:42.950 align:start position:0%
interim study it and continue to monitor
revenues

00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
00:29:45.269 --> 00:29:45.279 align:start position:0%
as time watches next next time that's
 
00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
all yeah

00:33:59.190 --> 00:33:59.200 align:start position:0%
just for a point of order here what
 
00:34:02.789 --> 00:34:02.799 align:start position:0%
happens if this motion doesn't pass
 
00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:05.440 align:start position:0%
um then we could reconsider another
 
00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:07.190 align:start position:0%
um then we could reconsider another
motion

00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
motion
 
00:34:10.230 --> 00:34:10.240 align:start position:0%
i don't think jen do you remember i
 
00:34:10.950 --> 00:34:10.960 align:start position:0%
don't ever
 
00:34:14.470 --> 00:34:14.480 align:start position:0%
remember an interim study going in as
 
00:34:17.589 --> 00:34:17.599 align:start position:0%
on no recommendation i don't know if
 
00:34:19.109 --> 00:34:19.119 align:start position:0%
they'd take that motion
 
00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
we have three staff that are on the call
 
00:34:31.589 --> 00:34:31.599 align:start position:0%
yes and content should stay with us can
 
00:34:31.599 --> 00:34:32.149 align:start position:0%
yes and content should stay with us can
can

00:34:32.149 --> 00:34:32.159 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:34.240 align:start position:0%
someone check that out even if we move
 
00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:35.200 align:start position:0%
on to the next
 
00:34:37.349 --> 00:34:37.359 align:start position:0%
next bill and come back to this if it
 
00:34:38.790 --> 00:34:38.800 align:start position:0%
comes out tied again
 
00:34:42.149 --> 00:34:42.159 align:start position:0%
sure can someone check that out yes
 
00:34:45.589 --> 00:34:45.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:47.430 --> 00:34:47.440 align:start position:0%
madam chair guys ask supportive order
 
00:34:50.149 --> 00:34:50.159 align:start position:0%
question yes
 
00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
so again the if i understand a
 
00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
motion to recommend for future
 
00:34:57.349 --> 00:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
legislation um
 
00:34:59.670 --> 00:34:59.680 align:start position:0%
all that chair says is all that motion
 
00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
really means is that in concept we agree
 
00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:03.280 align:start position:0%
with the idea of the bill
 
00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
and that the bill could be brought
 
00:35:06.310 --> 00:35:06.320 align:start position:0%
forward it doesn't necessarily mean the
 
00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
exact language of the current bill
 
00:35:09.270 --> 00:35:09.280 align:start position:0%
should be brought forward
 
00:35:10.950 --> 00:35:10.960 align:start position:0%
um at least that's how i've dealt with
 
00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:13.200 align:start position:0%
it in previous committees so i'm
 
00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:14.640 align:start position:0%
you know i guess i'm trying to make a
 
00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:16.400 align:start position:0%
clarification that i believe that that's
 
00:35:18.069 --> 00:35:18.079 align:start position:0%
what the intent is that
 
00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
we're just saying as a committee we like
 
00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
the general idea of this bill and should
 
00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:22.720 align:start position:0%
be brought forward
 
00:35:24.870 --> 00:35:24.880 align:start position:0%
in some form and be dealt with again is
 
00:35:28.829 --> 00:35:28.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:28.839 --> 00:35:31.349 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:35:31.349 --> 00:35:31.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:34.240 align:start position:0%
that's a fair representation yes on
 
00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:37.589 align:start position:0%
that's a fair representation yes on
[Music]

00:35:37.589 --> 00:35:37.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:40.950 --> 00:35:40.960 align:start position:0%
i in particular do not want to vote for
 
00:35:42.069 --> 00:35:42.079 align:start position:0%
something that
 
00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
on looks like we might be
 
00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
on taking away revenue
 
00:35:55.910 --> 00:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
which the bill itself did does do
 
00:35:59.349 --> 00:35:59.359 align:start position:0%
so and we have
 
00:36:01.349 --> 00:36:01.359 align:start position:0%
and and i'm not sure whether we have
 
00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
represented bursting
 
00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:06.880 align:start position:0%
for a first time i think so i'm
 
00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:08.640 align:start position:0%
representing schamberg seems to have put
 
00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:12.160 align:start position:0%
his hand up first
 
00:36:13.829 --> 00:36:13.839 align:start position:0%
uh madam chair i didn't take my hand
 
00:36:15.349 --> 00:36:15.359 align:start position:0%
down from the other one i'm sorry
 
00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:20.400 align:start position:0%

uh representative ames for reminding us
 
00:36:26.950 --> 00:36:26.960 align:start position:0%
that the
 
00:36:29.109 --> 00:36:29.119 align:start position:0%
business community did chime in on this
 
00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:30.880 align:start position:0%
and was against
 
00:36:33.829 --> 00:36:33.839 align:start position:0%
uh this i and i know the hearing was a
 
00:36:34.870 --> 00:36:34.880 align:start position:0%
long time ago
 
00:36:37.990 --> 00:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
so i'd like to remind the committee
 
00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:39.440 align:start position:0%
that in addition to the business
 
00:36:41.910 --> 00:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
community we also heard from some
 
00:36:45.109 --> 00:36:45.119 align:start position:0%
retirees and from some civilians for
 
00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:46.480 align:start position:0%
lack of a better word
 
00:36:48.390 --> 00:36:48.400 align:start position:0%
and they spoke about how this pushes
 
00:36:51.190 --> 00:36:51.200 align:start position:0%
seniors out on the risk curve
 
00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
and how this would be of help to seniors
 
00:36:56.230 --> 00:36:56.240 align:start position:0%
on a fixed income
 
00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh i i i recall that and i'd like to
 
00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:01.520 align:start position:0%

00:37:03.829 --> 00:37:03.839 align:start position:0%

coming through
 
00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:45.200 align:start position:0%
the review process in 2019
 
00:37:46.950 --> 00:37:46.960 align:start position:0%
there was another bill that i was the
 
00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
sponsor of which was a bill
 
00:37:52.950 --> 00:37:52.960 align:start position:0%
to extend the interest and dividends tax
 
00:37:55.990 --> 00:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
to capital gains and included in that
 
00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:57.030 align:start position:0%
to capital gains and included in that
bill

00:37:57.030 --> 00:37:57.040 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:37:59.510 --> 00:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
was a significant more significant
 
00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:00.230 align:start position:0%
was a significant more significant
actually

00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
increase in the exemptions for
 
00:38:06.390 --> 00:38:06.400 align:start position:0%
individuals responding directly to the
 
00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:07.510 align:start position:0%
individuals responding directly to the
concern

00:38:07.510 --> 00:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
concern
 
00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:09.280 align:start position:0%
that the representative bursting just
 
00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
spoke spoke to and that a number of
 
00:38:14.310 --> 00:38:14.320 align:start position:0%
people in the hearing on this bill also
 
00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
spoke to and i agree with that did
 
00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:16.870 align:start position:0%
spoke to and i agree with that did
happen

00:38:16.870 --> 00:38:16.880 align:start position:0%
happen
 
00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
so i i want to repeat that i
 
00:38:22.710 --> 00:38:22.720 align:start position:0%
am very much for changing those
 
00:38:24.790 --> 00:38:24.800 align:start position:0%
exemptions they're very old and very
 
00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:26.069 align:start position:0%
exemptions they're very old and very
small

00:38:26.069 --> 00:38:26.079 align:start position:0%
small
 
00:38:30.829 --> 00:38:30.839 align:start position:0%
but the linkage in this bill is clear
 
00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
to a pay for option that i don't
 
00:38:36.069 --> 00:38:36.079 align:start position:0%
support at this time based on the
 
00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
information i have
 
00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:42.240 align:start position:0%
and that's why i cannot vote for
 
00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:46.640 align:start position:0%
a recommendation for future legislation
 
00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:52.240 align:start position:0%
on um on this bill
 
00:38:54.390 --> 00:38:54.400 align:start position:0%
not just in its present form but in
 
00:38:56.310 --> 00:38:56.320 align:start position:0%
terms of what it stands for it stands
 
00:38:59.349 --> 00:38:59.359 align:start position:0%
for a specific change in one particular
 
00:39:01.349 --> 00:39:01.359 align:start position:0%
business tax credit that i don't have
 
00:39:02.790 --> 00:39:02.800 align:start position:0%
enough information on
 
00:39:05.829 --> 00:39:05.839 align:start position:0%
to support so that's i
 
00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
just wanted to clarify that thank you
 
00:39:13.750 --> 00:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
representative elmi um i did hear back
 
00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
from um house clerk paul smith
 
00:39:22.310 --> 00:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
um and you certainly need to vote on the
 
00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
pending motion
 
00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:27.200 align:start position:0%
um and if no recommendation is
 
00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
the only option it is something that can
 
00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:30.640 align:start position:0%
be done
 
00:39:34.230 --> 00:39:34.240 align:start position:0%
um still be just one state one interim
 
00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:35.680 align:start position:0%
study statement
 
00:39:39.270 --> 00:39:39.280 align:start position:0%
um that can include both sides um
 
00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
thought on the recommendation the lack
 
00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:46.630 --> 00:39:46.640 align:start position:0%
so it would be one statement but we
 
00:39:49.910 --> 00:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
could have two paragraphs sort of
 
00:39:52.069 --> 00:39:52.079 align:start position:0%
it probably wouldn't be two paragraphs
 
00:39:52.079 --> 00:39:53.190 align:start position:0%
it probably wouldn't be two paragraphs
technically

00:39:53.190 --> 00:39:53.200 align:start position:0%
technically
 
00:40:01.460 --> 00:40:01.470 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:01.470 --> 00:40:08.829 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:40:08.829 --> 00:40:08.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:13.190 --> 00:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
yes side said and the other side said
 
00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
yeah okay okay
 
00:40:20.290 --> 00:40:20.300 align:start position:0%
well shall we vote on um
 
00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:21.990 align:start position:0%

00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:32.560 align:start position:0%
it's been more than seconded yes
 
00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:35.920 align:start position:0%
the clerk seems to be having to get
 
00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:37.270 align:start position:0%
the clerk seems to be having to get
something

00:40:37.270 --> 00:40:37.280 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:40:42.950 --> 00:40:42.960 align:start position:0%

seven years eleven nays
 
00:42:59.589 --> 00:42:59.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
okay um does anyone
 
00:43:06.550 --> 00:43:06.560 align:start position:0%
wish to make a further
 
00:43:12.150 --> 00:43:12.160 align:start position:0%
motion of reconsideration or
 
00:43:19.750 --> 00:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:24.390 --> 00:43:24.400 align:start position:0%
there's no recommendation
 
00:43:26.230 --> 00:43:26.240 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry there's two people speaking at
 
00:43:27.910 --> 00:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
once representatively i don't know
 
00:43:30.790 --> 00:43:30.800 align:start position:0%
who the other person was uh can we go
 
00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:31.510 align:start position:0%
who the other person was uh can we go
forward

00:43:31.510 --> 00:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:43:34.870 --> 00:43:34.880 align:start position:0%
with uh no recommendation at this point
 
00:43:36.390 --> 00:43:36.400 align:start position:0%
or does
 
00:43:39.430 --> 00:43:39.440 align:start position:0%
if if no one wishes to make a
 
00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
um a reconsideration motion which i
 
00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
i mean there's a different vote count
 
00:43:51.270 --> 00:43:51.280 align:start position:0%
now so i mean a reconsideration could
 
00:43:55.349 --> 00:43:55.359 align:start position:0%
possibly be successful um
 
00:43:58.790 --> 00:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
but someone would have to move that
 
00:44:02.230 --> 00:44:02.240 align:start position:0%
chair point of order yes so again i
 
00:44:04.390 --> 00:44:04.400 align:start position:0%
think for a motion to reconsider you
 
00:44:05.670 --> 00:44:05.680 align:start position:0%
would have to have somebody in the
 
00:44:07.430 --> 00:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
affirmative side who voted in the
 
00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:07.990 align:start position:0%
affirmative side who voted in the
prevailing

00:44:07.990 --> 00:44:08.000 align:start position:0%
prevailing
 
00:44:11.109 --> 00:44:11.119 align:start position:0%
side to be able to make the motion so
 
00:44:12.550 --> 00:44:12.560 align:start position:0%
the only motion that could be
 
00:44:15.670 --> 00:44:15.680 align:start position:0%
emotionally considered is my motion to
 
00:44:17.589 --> 00:44:17.599 align:start position:0%
approve the bill for future legislation
 
00:44:19.109 --> 00:44:19.119 align:start position:0%
the other one failed and there is no
 
00:44:20.630 --> 00:44:20.640 align:start position:0%
affirmative side
 
00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
so at this point i think we're stuck at
 
00:44:24.069 --> 00:44:24.079 align:start position:0%
a no recommendation
 
00:44:27.270 --> 00:44:27.280 align:start position:0%
uh position um that is
 
00:44:29.349 --> 00:44:29.359 align:start position:0%
not true inside committees as i
 
00:44:30.630 --> 00:44:30.640 align:start position:0%
understand it
 
00:44:34.870 --> 00:44:34.880 align:start position:0%
jen do you remember i mean
 
00:44:36.630 --> 00:44:36.640 align:start position:0%
i'm not an expert in this area i don't
 
00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:39.040 align:start position:0%
want to yeah and to be
 
00:44:41.750 --> 00:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
yeah well and you'd have to check with
 
00:44:43.510 --> 00:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
the clerk again but my memory is that
 
00:44:45.349 --> 00:44:45.359 align:start position:0%
they told us that
 
00:44:48.950 --> 00:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
that um you don't
 
00:44:51.109 --> 00:44:51.119 align:start position:0%
you don't follow that role inside of
 
00:44:52.950 --> 00:44:52.960 align:start position:0%
committees but
 
00:44:55.349 --> 00:44:55.359 align:start position:0%
um but my memory is based on being
 
00:44:58.710 --> 00:44:58.720 align:start position:0%
trained a few years ago so
 
00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:03.760 align:start position:0%
well um we've spent 35 minutes on this
 
00:45:06.230 --> 00:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
yes we have i know and we weren't going
 
00:45:07.990 --> 00:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
to spend much time on it
 
00:45:11.829 --> 00:45:11.839 align:start position:0%
i think that you're you're
 
00:45:13.589 --> 00:45:13.599 align:start position:0%
trying to sort of dredge up further
 
00:45:14.950 --> 00:45:14.960 align:start position:0%
action i think we've reached a
 
00:45:17.750 --> 00:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
resolution on that last vote
 
00:45:21.990 --> 00:45:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:25.190 --> 00:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
i know we just put a blurb out saying
 
00:45:27.430 --> 00:45:27.440 align:start position:0%
without recommendation and give both
 
00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:30.150 align:start position:0%
without recommendation and give both
sides

00:45:30.150 --> 00:45:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:32.630 --> 00:45:32.640 align:start position:0%
yeah i think that's satisfactory i'd i'd
 
00:45:34.710 --> 00:45:34.720 align:start position:0%
be satisfied with that also
 
00:45:37.589 --> 00:45:37.599 align:start position:0%
yeah if that's okay with the people
 
00:45:41.430 --> 00:45:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:46.390 --> 00:45:46.400 align:start position:0%
okay do we we vote on no recommendation
 
00:45:50.309 --> 00:45:50.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:54.030 --> 00:45:54.040 align:start position:0%
okay so on the hb
 
00:45:56.750 --> 00:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
117 will go forward without
 
00:45:56.760 --> 00:45:58.550 align:start position:0%
117 will go forward without
recommendation

00:45:58.550 --> 00:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
00:46:00.230 --> 00:46:00.240 align:start position:0%
i hope we won't be told that was the
 
00:46:02.230 --> 00:46:02.240 align:start position:0%
wrong thing to do
 
00:46:08.309 --> 00:46:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:11.670 --> 00:46:11.680 align:start position:0%
and um representative
 
00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:17.349 align:start position:0%
and um representative
lang

00:46:17.349 --> 00:46:17.359 align:start position:0%

00:54:30.870 --> 00:54:30.880 align:start position:0%
on about this even before the term
 
00:54:34.710 --> 00:54:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:38.150 --> 00:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
and i
 
00:54:41.589 --> 00:54:41.599 align:start position:0%
hope that on any anything that we can
 
00:54:42.390 --> 00:54:42.400 align:start position:0%
think of
 
00:54:45.510 --> 00:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
that might be good
 
00:54:48.630 --> 00:54:48.640 align:start position:0%
to do in a recession uh in this
 
00:54:50.230 --> 00:54:50.240 align:start position:0%
particular recession
 
00:54:54.470 --> 00:54:54.480 align:start position:0%
to recover our revenues to some extent
 
00:54:56.150 --> 00:54:56.160 align:start position:0%
on this will not help during the
 
00:54:57.990 --> 00:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
recession but it could
 
00:55:01.990 --> 00:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
it could help the whole state later
 
00:55:05.190 --> 00:55:05.200 align:start position:0%
uh and we might both
 
00:55:08.309 --> 00:55:08.319 align:start position:0%
all we might agree bipartisanly that it
 
00:55:08.319 --> 00:55:08.950 align:start position:0%
all we might agree bipartisanly that it
did

00:55:08.950 --> 00:55:08.960 align:start position:0%
did
 
00:55:12.230 --> 00:55:12.240 align:start position:0%
or it may not work so we really do have
 
00:55:13.510 --> 00:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
to study it
 
00:55:16.789 --> 00:55:16.799 align:start position:0%
thank you um this is
 
00:55:19.829 --> 00:55:19.839 align:start position:0%
the last session
 
00:55:23.030 --> 00:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
um of this committee
 
00:55:26.950 --> 00:55:26.960 align:start position:0%
and so i'm about to thank you all
 
00:55:30.549 --> 00:55:30.559 align:start position:0%
we didn't get to do much of a of a party
 
00:55:31.589 --> 00:55:31.599 align:start position:0%
this year
 
00:55:34.309 --> 00:55:34.319 align:start position:0%
but i do want to thank you all for for
 
00:55:35.750 --> 00:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
the work that
 
00:55:38.630 --> 00:55:38.640 align:start position:0%
everybody has been doing on this and
 
00:55:41.270 --> 00:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
contributing to
 
00:55:43.630 --> 00:55:43.640 align:start position:0%
in lately in very difficult
 
00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:45.829 align:start position:0%
in lately in very difficult
circumstances

00:55:45.829 --> 00:55:45.839 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
00:55:49.109 --> 00:55:49.119 align:start position:0%
but on i think we did a lot of good work
 
00:55:51.589 --> 00:55:51.599 align:start position:0%
in the first
 
00:55:54.870 --> 00:55:54.880 align:start position:0%
first uh year of the term and
 
00:55:57.270 --> 00:55:57.280 align:start position:0%
on we had started to in the second year
 
00:55:58.470 --> 00:55:58.480 align:start position:0%
of the term
 
00:56:01.589 --> 00:56:01.599 align:start position:0%
and i hope that a lot of us will be
 
00:56:03.270 --> 00:56:03.280 align:start position:0%
getting back together again
 
00:56:07.190 --> 00:56:07.200 align:start position:0%
in january i just want to say something
 
00:56:10.870 --> 00:56:10.880 align:start position:0%
if i could uh madam chairman
 
00:56:14.829 --> 00:56:14.839 align:start position:0%
is that on june 11 we had a session at
 
00:56:14.839 --> 00:56:15.990 align:start position:0%
is that on june 11 we had a session at
rittermore

00:56:15.990 --> 00:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
rittermore
 
00:56:19.030 --> 00:56:19.040 align:start position:0%
if you notice this was only one bill
 
00:56:22.150 --> 00:56:22.160 align:start position:0%
that showed partis uh
 
00:56:24.870 --> 00:56:24.880 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan and that was the bill that
 
00:56:24.880 --> 00:56:25.430 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan and that was the bill that
we

00:56:25.430 --> 00:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:56:29.109 --> 00:56:29.119 align:start position:0%
put in for the revenues yes
 
00:56:32.230 --> 00:56:32.240 align:start position:0%
we agreed as a full committee
 
00:56:35.430 --> 00:56:35.440 align:start position:0%
the only way we could do that is the
 
00:56:37.670 --> 00:56:37.680 align:start position:0%
work that we did for two months
 
00:56:40.870 --> 00:56:40.880 align:start position:0%
as separate caucuses and then you and i
 
00:56:43.829 --> 00:56:43.839 align:start position:0%
would get together and find out what are
 
00:56:45.270 --> 00:56:45.280 align:start position:0%
the pros and cons
 
00:56:47.430 --> 00:56:47.440 align:start position:0%
and what are the issues and then bring
 
00:56:49.030 --> 00:56:49.040 align:start position:0%
them back to the caucus and so
 
00:56:51.109 --> 00:56:51.119 align:start position:0%
finally we come up with something we
 
00:56:52.630 --> 00:56:52.640 align:start position:0%
agreed on
 
00:56:56.069 --> 00:56:56.079 align:start position:0%
no other committee has done that so
 
00:56:58.789 --> 00:56:58.799 align:start position:0%
everybody should be recommended to
 
00:57:00.150 --> 00:57:00.160 align:start position:0%
complement themselves
 
00:57:02.230 --> 00:57:02.240 align:start position:0%
what we've done because to be an
 
00:57:04.230 --> 00:57:04.240 align:start position:0%
effective legislator you have to know
 
00:57:05.349 --> 00:57:05.359 align:start position:0%
how to
 
00:57:07.510 --> 00:57:07.520 align:start position:0%
negotiate and you have to know how to
 
00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:08.390 align:start position:0%
negotiate and you have to know how to
compromise

00:57:08.390 --> 00:57:08.400 align:start position:0%
compromise
 
00:57:13.910 --> 00:57:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:16.950 --> 00:57:16.960 align:start position:0%
just just add my voice uh compliments to
 
00:57:18.230 --> 00:57:18.240 align:start position:0%
our two
 
00:57:21.910 --> 00:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
leaders from each side of our committee
 
00:57:24.950 --> 00:57:24.960 align:start position:0%
and each side probably is not the best
 
00:57:26.630 --> 00:57:26.640 align:start position:0%
reference but uh
 
00:57:28.870 --> 00:57:28.880 align:start position:0%
but uh thank you representative major
 
00:57:31.190 --> 00:57:31.200 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative army
 
00:57:35.430 --> 00:57:35.440 align:start position:0%
yes yes i want to echo that
 
00:57:38.150 --> 00:57:38.160 align:start position:0%
and to but to complement every single
 
00:57:39.990 --> 00:57:40.000 align:start position:0%
person on this committee for
 
00:57:43.670 --> 00:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
working together on this and it became
 
00:57:47.109 --> 00:57:47.119 align:start position:0%
something of a wonder and
 
00:57:49.910 --> 00:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
maybe a scandal to some that that the
 
00:57:53.190 --> 00:57:53.200 align:start position:0%
ways and means committee was doing that
 
00:57:56.950 --> 00:57:56.960 align:start position:0%
across the legislature and i hope that
 
00:57:57.589 --> 00:57:57.599 align:start position:0%
we can
 
00:57:59.270 --> 00:57:59.280 align:start position:0%
continue doing that in the future there
 
00:58:00.870 --> 00:58:00.880 align:start position:0%
are things that we will
 
00:58:04.950 --> 00:58:04.960 align:start position:0%
always disagree with but you're right
 
00:58:08.390 --> 00:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
and i've noticed and work together
 
00:58:12.069 --> 00:58:12.079 align:start position:0%
is is really important so
 
00:58:16.470 --> 00:58:16.480 align:start position:0%
