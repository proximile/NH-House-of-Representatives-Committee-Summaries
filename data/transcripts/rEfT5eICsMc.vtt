and
 
00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor of the of this bill is
 
00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
senator gaida but here with us to
 
00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
introduce it this morning
 
00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:11.749 --> 00:07:11.759 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and committee
 
00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:14.560 align:start position:0%
i'm here to introduce
 
00:07:16.629 --> 00:07:16.639 align:start position:0%
sb 200
 
00:07:19.749 --> 00:07:19.759 align:start position:0%
as written it deals with
 
00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
increasing the number of
 
00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
commissioners from
 
00:07:27.189 --> 00:07:27.199 align:start position:0%
three to five in one particular location
 
00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:29.120 align:start position:0%
you have already provided us with
 
00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
legislation that gives blanket approval
 
00:07:34.469 --> 00:07:34.479 align:start position:0%
not just in one community
 
00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:36.880 align:start position:0%
so that this bill
 
00:07:39.749 --> 00:07:39.759 align:start position:0%
as written is unnecessary
 
00:07:43.029 --> 00:07:43.039 align:start position:0%
and that if you have desires to use that
 
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
bill for something else
 
00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:47.360 align:start position:0%

um and i am reopening the meeting at
 
00:32:21.669 --> 00:32:21.679 align:start position:0%
this time we have a hearing scheduled on
 
00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:24.320 align:start position:0%
a non-germane amendment
 
00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
uh your chair is the sponsor of that
 
00:32:28.789 --> 00:32:28.799 align:start position:0%
non-germain amendment
 
00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
and she will be stepping down from the
 
00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
chair of this meeting so that the vice
 
00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:35.360 align:start position:0%
chair can conduct the hearing on the
 
00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
non-germain amendment since i am the
 
00:32:40.149 --> 00:32:40.159 align:start position:0%
sponsor before the meeting actually
 
00:32:43.029 --> 00:32:43.039 align:start position:0%
opens with the non-germain amendment
 
00:32:46.870 --> 00:32:46.880 align:start position:0%
understand as chair that i consider
 
00:32:49.509 --> 00:32:49.519 align:start position:0%
that this committee has available to it
 
00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
the entire calendar to work on bills and
 
00:32:54.389 --> 00:32:54.399 align:start position:0%
issues relating to redistricting
 
00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:56.320 align:start position:0%
and accordingly even though we have
 
00:32:59.430 --> 00:32:59.440 align:start position:0%
passed a congressional map uh earlier
 
00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:01.200 align:start position:0%
and we
 
00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:03.440 align:start position:0%
know that it is going to be vetoed or
 
00:33:05.909 --> 00:33:05.919 align:start position:0%
expected to be vetoed so i don't believe
 
00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
it's actually happened yet so we have
 
00:33:10.630 --> 00:33:10.640 align:start position:0%
time to continue our work and that of
 
00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:12.720 align:start position:0%
course is why we have re-noticed this
 
00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:13.830 align:start position:0%
course is why we have re-noticed this
meeting

00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
00:33:16.149 --> 00:33:16.159 align:start position:0%
and this committee to convene and
 
00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
committee members should have received
 
00:33:19.909 --> 00:33:19.919 align:start position:0%
notice of a meeting next week
 
00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:22.240 align:start position:0%
where i expect that we will be having
 
00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
executive session on bills
 
00:33:27.909 --> 00:33:27.919 align:start position:0%
that relate to what i hope to be the
 
00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:30.720 align:start position:0%
subject matter of sb 200 if we get
 
00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
through the hearing on my non-germain
 
00:33:33.909 --> 00:33:33.919 align:start position:0%
amendment which will be
 
00:33:36.630 --> 00:33:36.640 align:start position:0%

and the noticing that has occurred
 
00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:06.640 align:start position:0%
is to have a public hearing on this
 
00:35:09.109 --> 00:35:09.119 align:start position:0%
matter so that this committee will have
 
00:35:11.829 --> 00:35:11.839 align:start position:0%
a vehicle to continue its work in
 
00:35:13.270 --> 00:35:13.280 align:start position:0%

could you help me pass these out
 
00:35:21.510 --> 00:35:21.520 align:start position:0%

00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
you have a map in front of you oh let me
 
00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:26.240 align:start position:0%
keep the top one
 
00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:27.510 align:start position:0%
keep the top one
i

00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:31.040 align:start position:0%
i have um some maps for you to consider
 
00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:33.200 align:start position:0%
as we speak about the amendment in front
 
00:35:34.069 --> 00:35:34.079 align:start position:0%
of you
 
00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
um for you to consider and and what
 
00:35:37.589 --> 00:35:37.599 align:start position:0%
you're getting now is
 
00:35:41.109 --> 00:35:41.119 align:start position:0%
um a governor sununu the proposed map
 
00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
that is in front of you it's actually
 
00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
labeled governor sununu and i'll talk
 
00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:46.160 align:start position:0%
about that in a minute
 
00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
and it sort of details exactly what you
 
00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:50.720 align:start position:0%
have in front of you from staff only it
 
00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
provides you
 
00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
a pictorial
 
00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
with county lines because um there does
 
00:36:00.069 --> 00:36:00.079 align:start position:0%
seem to be some in my opinion obsession
 
00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
with the pictorial of a map
 
00:36:05.829 --> 00:36:05.839 align:start position:0%
without any um understanding of the
 
00:36:08.069 --> 00:36:08.079 align:start position:0%
population shifts that occur
 
00:36:10.069 --> 00:36:10.079 align:start position:0%
so this map
 
00:36:11.430 --> 00:36:11.440 align:start position:0%
that you have in front of you and the
 
00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:12.710 align:start position:0%
that you have in front of you and the
amendment

00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:12.720 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:13.750 align:start position:0%
amendment
um

00:36:13.750 --> 00:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:16.310 --> 00:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
you and i found out about together
 
00:36:19.109 --> 00:36:19.119 align:start position:0%
um on march 22nd
 
00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:21.520 align:start position:0%
this map was presented
 
00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
to both the president of the
 
00:36:26.950 --> 00:36:26.960 align:start position:0%
senate and the speaker of the house from
 
00:36:30.069 --> 00:36:30.079 align:start position:0%
the governor's office in regards to
 
00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:32.320 align:start position:0%
a proposal for a draft congressional
 
00:36:34.790 --> 00:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
redistricting map
 
00:36:37.349 --> 00:36:37.359 align:start position:0%
it was pointed out that it was not the
 
00:36:39.109 --> 00:36:39.119 align:start position:0%
only solution i think this committee is
 
00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:41.200 align:start position:0%
well aware that any map
 
00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
mapping exercise that you're basing on
 
00:36:44.950 --> 00:36:44.960 align:start position:0%
population can
 
00:36:47.349 --> 00:36:47.359 align:start position:0%
can have a number of outcomes
 
00:36:47.359 --> 00:36:48.470 align:start position:0%
can have a number of outcomes
and

00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:48.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:36:50.950 --> 00:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
in this particular case
 
00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
the governor's office and this is a
 
00:36:54.790 --> 00:36:54.800 align:start position:0%
matter of public record
 
00:36:57.750 --> 00:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
indicated that their
 
00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
his standards at that time were
 
00:37:03.670 --> 00:37:03.680 align:start position:0%
competitive passes the smell test
 
00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:04.050 align:start position:0%
competitive passes the smell test
and

00:37:04.050 --> 00:37:04.060 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:37:04.060 --> 00:37:06.069 align:start position:0%
and
[Music]

00:37:06.069 --> 00:37:06.079 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:37:06.079 --> 00:37:07.109 align:start position:0%
[Music]
i

00:37:07.109 --> 00:37:07.119 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:08.970 align:start position:0%
describes it as being um
 
00:37:08.970 --> 00:37:10.230 align:start position:0%
describes it as being um
[Music]

00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:10.240 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:12.720 align:start position:0%
something not immune from challenges or
 
00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:14.640 align:start position:0%
constituent services
 
00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
um what he did point out is that there's
 
00:37:18.150 --> 00:37:18.160 align:start position:0%
still time to get the work done and
 
00:37:20.829 --> 00:37:20.839 align:start position:0%
that's what we're here to begin
 
00:37:24.710 --> 00:37:24.720 align:start position:0%
so what you see in front of you is the
 
00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:26.640 align:start position:0%
map is proposed
 
00:37:30.069 --> 00:37:30.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:30.079 --> 00:37:30.950 align:start position:0%
 
it

00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:33.190 align:start position:0%
it
splits

00:37:33.190 --> 00:37:33.200 align:start position:0%
splits
 
00:37:35.430 --> 00:37:35.440 align:start position:0%
some counties
 
00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:36.390 align:start position:0%
some counties
and

00:37:36.390 --> 00:37:36.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
um the reality is is that when the
 
00:37:41.829 --> 00:37:41.839 align:start position:0%
population of this map just so you're
 
00:37:41.839 --> 00:37:42.870 align:start position:0%
population of this map just so you're
aware

00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:42.880 align:start position:0%
aware
 
00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
is actually
 
00:37:47.589 --> 00:37:47.599 align:start position:0%
looked at it has a deviation of slightly
 
00:37:50.310 --> 00:37:50.320 align:start position:0%
over a thousand
 
00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:52.240 align:start position:0%
we know from
 
00:37:54.550 --> 00:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
law that
 
00:37:57.109 --> 00:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
in congressional district mapping
 
00:37:59.910 --> 00:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
the numbers are very important there are
 
00:38:03.190 --> 00:38:03.200 align:start position:0%
some circumstances in fact where
 
00:38:05.589 --> 00:38:05.599 align:start position:0%
other factors can
 
00:38:05.599 --> 00:38:07.030 align:start position:0%
other factors can
override

00:38:07.030 --> 00:38:07.040 align:start position:0%
override
 
00:38:09.190 --> 00:38:09.200 align:start position:0%
the deviation issue in regards to
 
00:38:11.430 --> 00:38:11.440 align:start position:0%
congressional map but in the first
 
00:38:13.270 --> 00:38:13.280 align:start position:0%
instance before this committee i think
 
00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:20.790 --> 00:38:20.800 align:start position:0%
that is what we've been considering
 
00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to describe the outline of
 
00:38:24.870 --> 00:38:24.880 align:start position:0%
this map
 
00:38:29.589 --> 00:38:29.599 align:start position:0%
um it is what it is i i have been amused
 
00:38:31.510 --> 00:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
not amused i have noted that many people
 
00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
try to ascribe characteristics
 
00:38:36.470 --> 00:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
of maps as to what they may or may not
 
00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:38.560 align:start position:0%
look like and i have to tell you
 
00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
as somebody with an msw i always wonder
 
00:38:43.270 --> 00:38:43.280 align:start position:0%
whether we're doing a raw shot ink test
 
00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:44.069 align:start position:0%
whether we're doing a raw shot ink test
or

00:38:44.069 --> 00:38:44.079 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
um exactly what it is we're trying to do
 
00:38:48.150 --> 00:38:48.160 align:start position:0%
when we try to describe a map
 
00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:51.440 align:start position:0%
pictorially referring to other objects
 
00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:52.390 align:start position:0%
pictorially referring to other objects
um

00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:52.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:56.069 --> 00:38:56.079 align:start position:0%
what we have also heard a lot about is
 
00:38:56.079 --> 00:38:57.190 align:start position:0%
what we have also heard a lot about is
um

00:38:57.190 --> 00:38:57.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:59.270 --> 00:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
the regards to the fact that things need
 
00:39:01.910 --> 00:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
to be changed and christina i can just
 
00:39:03.910 --> 00:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
pass it out at the end
 
00:39:14.870 --> 00:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:17.200 align:start position:0%
i've also just so we all understand you
 
00:39:19.109 --> 00:39:19.119 align:start position:0%
remember i said something about the the
 
00:39:19.119 --> 00:39:20.710 align:start position:0%
remember i said something about the the
deviations

00:39:20.710 --> 00:39:20.720 align:start position:0%
deviations
 
00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:21.990 align:start position:0%
deviations
um

00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:25.589 --> 00:39:25.599 align:start position:0%
is the present day map
 
00:39:25.599 --> 00:39:26.790 align:start position:0%
is the present day map
so

00:39:26.790 --> 00:39:26.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:33.990 align:start position:0%
 
which

00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:35.589 --> 00:39:35.599 align:start position:0%
there has been
 
00:39:37.349 --> 00:39:37.359 align:start position:0%
some discussion
 
00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:40.240 align:start position:0%
about how it doesn't really
 
00:39:43.109 --> 00:39:43.119 align:start position:0%
need to change much
 
00:39:49.109 --> 00:39:49.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:51.589 --> 00:39:51.599 align:start position:0%
has a deviation
 
00:39:56.150 --> 00:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
of approximately 1200 i believe
 
00:39:58.069 --> 00:39:58.079 align:start position:0%
which accounts for some discussion about
 
00:39:59.910 --> 00:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
changing something but
 
00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:01.270 align:start position:0%
changing something but
um

00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
the reality is um
 
00:40:06.870 --> 00:40:06.880 align:start position:0%
if we're we're starting to look at the
 
00:40:09.589 --> 00:40:09.599 align:start position:0%
picture of the map as something
 
00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:12.240 align:start position:0%
that we do these other tests from
 
00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:13.910 align:start position:0%
that we do these other tests from
um

00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:16.309 --> 00:40:16.319 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't we have this big sort of
 
00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:18.720 align:start position:0%
arm into it so so the question then
 
00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:19.990 align:start position:0%
arm into it so so the question then
becomes

00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
becomes
 
00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:22.720 align:start position:0%
um we had a lot of discussion about
 
00:40:25.349 --> 00:40:25.359 align:start position:0%
where we began and i think in the past
 
00:40:27.430 --> 00:40:27.440 align:start position:0%
hundred years things really haven't
 
00:40:28.630 --> 00:40:28.640 align:start position:0%
changed so
 
00:40:31.109 --> 00:40:31.119 align:start position:0%
i also have for the committee
 
00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:55.109 --> 00:40:55.119 align:start position:0%
so as we all continue to do our work in
 
00:40:57.990 --> 00:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
considering the map and as i consider
 
00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:00.720 align:start position:0%
governor sununu's map which has been
 
00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:02.720 align:start position:0%
presented to the committee to consider
 
00:41:09.430 --> 00:41:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
how did we get to
 
00:41:14.230 --> 00:41:14.240 align:start position:0%
to having this corner of the state be
 
00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:21.670 --> 00:41:21.680 align:start position:0%
that was apparently what looked like
 
00:41:24.069 --> 00:41:24.079 align:start position:0%
approximately an equal deviation of the
 
00:41:27.030 --> 00:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
state but today
 
00:41:29.030 --> 00:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
that would be a deviation of
 
00:41:34.870 --> 00:41:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:38.309 --> 00:41:38.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:45.270 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:45.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:41:47.589 --> 00:41:47.599 align:start position:0%
as i i look of the progression and if
 
00:41:50.230 --> 00:41:50.240 align:start position:0%
you look you know
 
00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:54.230 align:start position:0%
you look you know
astonishing

00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:56.790 --> 00:41:56.800 align:start position:0%
how little deviations to the border of
 
00:41:59.349 --> 00:41:59.359 align:start position:0%
this have just continued
 
00:42:01.750 --> 00:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
because apparently
 
00:42:03.990 --> 00:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
historically we have not questioned the
 
00:42:07.510 --> 00:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:09.190 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:42:09.190 --> 00:42:09.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
i want to thank the governor for
 
00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
presenting his map and the criteria
 
00:42:15.589 --> 00:42:15.599 align:start position:0%
which in my struggles to understand
 
00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
caused me to go back and review this
 
00:42:19.990 --> 00:42:20.000 align:start position:0%
to consider why are we
 
00:42:23.109 --> 00:42:23.119 align:start position:0%
why are we starting from where we are
 
00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
when if i go back to 100 years and the
 
00:42:27.589 --> 00:42:27.599 align:start position:0%
population shift in this state has been
 
00:42:30.630 --> 00:42:30.640 align:start position:0%
that significant
 
00:42:32.470 --> 00:42:32.480 align:start position:0%
shouldn't we be looking at something
 
00:42:34.950 --> 00:42:34.960 align:start position:0%
maybe entirely new which i will just say
 
00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
in my experience on local boards makes
 
00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
me feel like i'm at a budget committee
 
00:42:40.150 --> 00:42:40.160 align:start position:0%
meeting again when the management always
 
00:42:41.589 --> 00:42:41.599 align:start position:0%
comes in with the budget starting from
 
00:42:43.030 --> 00:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
last year's budget and the new budget
 
00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
committee members always want to start
 
00:42:46.790 --> 00:42:46.800 align:start position:0%
from zero
 
00:42:50.069 --> 00:42:50.079 align:start position:0%
so it's an argument that occurs or a
 
00:42:51.510 --> 00:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
different position that occurs in
 
00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
consideration of a lot of things
 
00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:54.550 align:start position:0%
consideration of a lot of things
so

00:42:54.550 --> 00:42:54.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:42:57.109 --> 00:42:57.119 align:start position:0%
i want to thank the committee and the
 
00:42:59.030 --> 00:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
committee chair for allowing me the
 
00:43:01.349 --> 00:43:01.359 align:start position:0%
indulgence of sharing with you what i
 
00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
took a look at as i struggled
 
00:43:06.630 --> 00:43:06.640 align:start position:0%
to determine whether or not
 
00:43:09.109 --> 00:43:09.119 align:start position:0%
the map that had been proposed
 
00:43:11.030 --> 00:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
made sense
 
00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
as i said
 
00:43:16.150 --> 00:43:16.160 align:start position:0%
that there is a deviation in population
 
00:43:17.829 --> 00:43:17.839 align:start position:0%
and as i said there are certain
 
00:43:19.750 --> 00:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
circumstances where that deviation may
 
00:43:21.270 --> 00:43:21.280 align:start position:0%
not matter
 
00:43:23.109 --> 00:43:23.119 align:start position:0%
but i think as this committee goes
 
00:43:25.510 --> 00:43:25.520 align:start position:0%
forward i'm urging it to consider that
 
00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:27.280 align:start position:0%
maybe we should
 
00:43:29.670 --> 00:43:29.680 align:start position:0%
continue to try and strive to meet that
 
00:43:31.990 --> 00:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
federal standard
 
00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:33.990 align:start position:0%
federal standard
and

00:43:33.990 --> 00:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
with that
 
00:43:38.230 --> 00:43:38.240 align:start position:0%
i am open to any questions with the
 
00:43:40.630 --> 00:43:40.640 align:start position:0%
understanding that
 
00:43:42.309 --> 00:43:42.319 align:start position:0%
i did not
 
00:43:44.470 --> 00:43:44.480 align:start position:0%
actually draft this map
 
00:43:46.309 --> 00:43:46.319 align:start position:0%
and i have not have any had any direct
 
00:43:48.390 --> 00:43:48.400 align:start position:0%
discussions with anybody on the criteria
 
00:43:50.550 --> 00:43:50.560 align:start position:0%
for drawing the map i just shared with
 
00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
you my sort of struggles to understand
 
00:43:56.870 --> 00:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
how it might make some sense
 
00:43:59.750 --> 00:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
and what the history of the mapping was
 
00:44:02.069 --> 00:44:02.079 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:44:03.589 --> 00:44:03.599 align:start position:0%
thank you i just wanted to clarify
 
00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
something you said in the need for
 
00:44:07.109 --> 00:44:07.119 align:start position:0%
changing the current districts the
 
00:44:08.790 --> 00:44:08.800 align:start position:0%
deviation was twelve hundred did you
 
00:44:10.470 --> 00:44:10.480 align:start position:0%
mean twelve hundred or twelve thousand
 
00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
twelve thousand i think energize
 
00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
representative turcotte
 
00:44:16.309 --> 00:44:16.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
representative for taking the question i
 
00:44:21.030 --> 00:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
realize you are presenting the map that
 
00:44:24.630 --> 00:44:24.640 align:start position:0%
was personally drawn by the governor
 
00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
are you aware do you know if either the
 
00:44:30.069 --> 00:44:30.079 align:start position:0%
governor or somebody from his uh
 
00:44:31.910 --> 00:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
his team will be here to talk about and
 
00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:33.030 align:start position:0%
his team will be here to talk about and
explain

00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
explain
 
00:44:35.190 --> 00:44:35.200 align:start position:0%
uh some of the rationales behind this
 
00:44:37.670 --> 00:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
map my understanding is the governor had
 
00:44:39.430 --> 00:44:39.440 align:start position:0%
a scheduling problem this year and there
 
00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
will not be anybody from his office here
 
00:44:43.589 --> 00:44:43.599 align:start position:0%
i spoke with somebody earlier today and
 
00:44:45.510 --> 00:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
they will not be able to make it thank
 
00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:48.309 align:start position:0%
they will not be able to make it thank
you

00:44:48.309 --> 00:44:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:51.750 --> 00:44:51.760 align:start position:0%
further questions representative lane
 
00:44:54.390 --> 00:44:54.400 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
00:44:56.550 --> 00:44:56.560 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
00:44:58.230 --> 00:44:58.240 align:start position:0%
representative griffin
 
00:44:58.240 --> 00:45:00.069 align:start position:0%
representative griffin
um

00:45:00.069 --> 00:45:00.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:02.230 --> 00:45:02.240 align:start position:0%
what is the deviation on the governor's
 
00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:03.270 align:start position:0%
what is the deviation on the governor's
map

00:45:03.270 --> 00:45:03.280 align:start position:0%
map
 
00:45:07.030 --> 00:45:07.040 align:start position:0%
uh is i think it's 1028
 
00:45:08.950 --> 00:45:08.960 align:start position:0%
does anybody have the i think that's
 
00:45:10.870 --> 00:45:10.880 align:start position:0%
what i came up with
 
00:45:12.950 --> 00:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
i might be a little off
 
00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:14.470 align:start position:0%
i might be a little off
okay

00:45:14.470 --> 00:45:14.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:45:16.309 --> 00:45:16.319 align:start position:0%
representative barry do you know i don't
 
00:45:17.430 --> 00:45:17.440 align:start position:0%
have the exact number in front of me but
 
00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
i believe when i did it was roughly
 
00:45:21.030 --> 00:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
twelve hundred people um well i thought
 
00:45:23.349 --> 00:45:23.359 align:start position:0%
it was a thousand uh yeah g give or take
 
00:45:24.630 --> 00:45:24.640 align:start position:0%
don't hold me to that exact number but i
 
00:45:26.550 --> 00:45:26.560 align:start position:0%
believe it's i'm going for going off of
 
00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:27.910 align:start position:0%
believe it's i'm going for going off of
memory

00:45:27.910 --> 00:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
memory
 
00:45:30.470 --> 00:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
i have a follow-up follow-up um
 
00:45:33.270 --> 00:45:33.280 align:start position:0%
i don't recall what the deviation was on
 
00:45:35.670 --> 00:45:35.680 align:start position:0%
the map that this committee
 
00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:36.470 align:start position:0%
the map that this committee
um

00:45:36.470 --> 00:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:38.710 --> 00:45:38.720 align:start position:0%
sent over to the senate do you know what
 
00:45:43.030 --> 00:45:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:47.030 --> 00:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
89 i think okay 88 and 89 respectively
 
00:45:48.870 --> 00:45:48.880 align:start position:0%
because there's the uh senator gray
 
00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:51.280 align:start position:0%
often refers to the um the forgotten
 
00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:52.960 align:start position:0%
half person
 
00:45:56.309 --> 00:45:56.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:59.589 --> 00:45:59.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:02.069 --> 00:46:02.079 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh
 
00:46:04.790 --> 00:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
could you tell us how many towns change
 
00:46:07.190 --> 00:46:07.200 align:start position:0%
with respect to this map
 
00:46:08.710 --> 00:46:08.720 align:start position:0%
no i could not
 
00:46:09.670 --> 00:46:09.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:11.440 align:start position:0%
and if i could further answer frank
 
00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:14.240 align:start position:0%
frankly i didn't really consider that
 
00:46:15.910 --> 00:46:15.920 align:start position:0%
as a criteria because i'm not really
 
00:46:18.069 --> 00:46:18.079 align:start position:0%
quite sure where we're starting from
 
00:46:19.910 --> 00:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
and in my opinion
 
00:46:21.910 --> 00:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
we're starting from drawing districts
 
00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:24.160 align:start position:0%
that meet the criteria and in my
 
00:46:25.670 --> 00:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
experience many people in my own
 
00:46:26.790 --> 00:46:26.800 align:start position:0%
community don't even know what
 
00:46:28.150 --> 00:46:28.160 align:start position:0%
congressional district they're in they
 
00:46:29.829 --> 00:46:29.839 align:start position:0%
go and pull a ballot with candidates
 
00:46:31.510 --> 00:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
that they've heard about
 
00:46:33.430 --> 00:46:33.440 align:start position:0%
and the numbering of the district does
 
00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
not matter to them i must ascribe a
 
00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:38.480 align:start position:0%
little bit to that fault
 
00:46:40.069 --> 00:46:40.079 align:start position:0%
because of course you might have noticed
 
00:46:42.069 --> 00:46:42.079 align:start position:0%
ols comes back with different district
 
00:46:42.079 --> 00:46:43.430 align:start position:0%
ols comes back with different district
numbers

00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
00:46:45.670 --> 00:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
than we had on the maps sometime when
 
00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
you're drafting a map and you submit it
 
00:46:49.829 --> 00:46:49.839 align:start position:0%
the district numbers come back and i'm
 
00:46:51.589 --> 00:46:51.599 align:start position:0%
always somewhat amused by people who
 
00:46:53.109 --> 00:46:53.119 align:start position:0%
complain who are complaining about the
 
00:46:55.510 --> 00:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
redistricting because all of their
 
00:46:57.430 --> 00:46:57.440 align:start position:0%
representative labels have their
 
00:46:59.190 --> 00:46:59.200 align:start position:0%
district number on it and now it's going
 
00:47:02.069 --> 00:47:02.079 align:start position:0%
to change and i i'm fortunate i can
 
00:47:03.829 --> 00:47:03.839 align:start position:0%
represent myself as one community
 
00:47:06.550 --> 00:47:06.560 align:start position:0%
because i think my district number is 36
 
00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:18.390 --> 00:47:18.400 align:start position:0%
the issue was not what the district
 
00:47:20.870 --> 00:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
number was it was just how many towns
 
00:47:22.549 --> 00:47:22.559 align:start position:0%
had changed from
 
00:47:24.790 --> 00:47:24.800 align:start position:0%
one district into the other but if you
 
00:47:26.069 --> 00:47:26.079 align:start position:0%
don't know the answer to that that's
 
00:47:26.079 --> 00:47:28.390 align:start position:0%
don't know the answer to that that's
fine

00:47:28.390 --> 00:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:29.910 --> 00:47:29.920 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
00:47:31.750 --> 00:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
representative lane
 
00:47:33.510 --> 00:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair representative
 
00:47:35.670 --> 00:47:35.680 align:start position:0%
griffin um
 
00:47:39.270 --> 00:47:39.280 align:start position:0%
do you know if the uh the incumbents
 
00:47:41.030 --> 00:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
where they are if they were taken into
 
00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
consideration when drawing this map i do
 
00:47:45.349 --> 00:47:45.359 align:start position:0%
not know that that was taken into
 
00:47:47.109 --> 00:47:47.119 align:start position:0%
account in drawing this map and if i
 
00:47:48.630 --> 00:47:48.640 align:start position:0%
could just clarify i believe somebody
 
00:47:50.470 --> 00:47:50.480 align:start position:0%
said that governor sununu drew that map
 
00:47:52.630 --> 00:47:52.640 align:start position:0%
just so i'm clear i'm not i i this came
 
00:47:54.630 --> 00:47:54.640 align:start position:0%
from governor sununu's office
 
00:47:56.950 --> 00:47:56.960 align:start position:0%
um as we all know from the press release
 
00:47:59.430 --> 00:47:59.440 align:start position:0%
and from the letter that was issued and
 
00:48:00.950 --> 00:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
that would be the extent of my ability
 
00:48:05.349 --> 00:48:05.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:07.829 --> 00:48:07.839 align:start position:0%
follow up mr chair
 
00:48:07.839 --> 00:48:09.829 align:start position:0%
follow up mr chair
yes

00:48:09.829 --> 00:48:09.839 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:48:09.839 --> 00:48:11.270 align:start position:0%
yes
representative

00:48:11.270 --> 00:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:48:13.349 --> 00:48:13.359 align:start position:0%
even though it came from his office you
 
00:48:15.349 --> 00:48:15.359 align:start position:0%
submitted it so you've had no
 
00:48:18.549 --> 00:48:18.559 align:start position:0%
conversations at all with
 
00:48:20.950 --> 00:48:20.960 align:start position:0%
the governor about the map
 
00:48:22.390 --> 00:48:22.400 align:start position:0%
i've had no conversations with the
 
00:48:24.390 --> 00:48:24.400 align:start position:0%
governor representative lane
 
00:48:26.549 --> 00:48:26.559 align:start position:0%
thank you as a committee chair i viewed
 
00:48:28.950 --> 00:48:28.960 align:start position:0%
it my obligation to
 
00:48:30.870 --> 00:48:30.880 align:start position:0%
the state to continue the process to
 
00:48:32.950 --> 00:48:32.960 align:start position:0%
work on a map and i think the governor's
 
00:48:35.190 --> 00:48:35.200 align:start position:0%
office for providing me
 
00:48:39.030 --> 00:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
with a districting map that i could use
 
00:48:41.589 --> 00:48:41.599 align:start position:0%
as a vehicle to amend the senate bill so
 
00:48:43.990 --> 00:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
we have something that we can continue
 
00:48:47.270 --> 00:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:49.270 --> 00:48:49.280 align:start position:0%
representative berry uh yes thank you mr
 
00:48:51.670 --> 00:48:51.680 align:start position:0%
chairman uh and thank you um madam
 
00:48:54.470 --> 00:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
chairman um for providing us with the
 
00:48:57.510 --> 00:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
1880 map um and the reason i'm glad that
 
00:48:59.670 --> 00:48:59.680 align:start position:0%
that has been circulated around is there
 
00:49:03.589 --> 00:49:03.599 align:start position:0%
seems to be this uh obsession with
 
00:49:07.349 --> 00:49:07.359 align:start position:0%
keeping things the way they are
 
00:49:09.750 --> 00:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
so when i look at
 
00:49:12.790 --> 00:49:12.800 align:start position:0%
the 1880 congressional map i look at the
 
00:49:15.829 --> 00:49:15.839 align:start position:0%
present day map and i look at
 
00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
the proposed map the amendment we're
 
00:49:19.030 --> 00:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
speaking about today
 
00:49:20.790 --> 00:49:20.800 align:start position:0%
my question and you probably don't know
 
00:49:23.670 --> 00:49:23.680 align:start position:0%
the answer to this so i'm sorry for it's
 
00:49:25.030 --> 00:49:25.040 align:start position:0%
i you probably don't know the answer but
 
00:49:26.150 --> 00:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
i'm going to ask it anyways because it
 
00:49:28.390 --> 00:49:28.400 align:start position:0%
seems to be a popular question how many
 
00:49:30.470 --> 00:49:30.480 align:start position:0%
towns have moved
 
00:49:34.150 --> 00:49:34.160 align:start position:0%
since 1880 to the governor's proposed
 
00:49:34.160 --> 00:49:35.270 align:start position:0%
since 1880 to the governor's proposed
map

00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
map
 
00:49:37.190 --> 00:49:37.200 align:start position:0%
conversely how many towns have moved
 
00:49:41.030 --> 00:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
since 1880 to the present day map
 
00:49:42.710 --> 00:49:42.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i do not have
 
00:49:45.670 --> 00:49:45.680 align:start position:0%
an answer uh follow up mr chairman
 
00:49:46.710 --> 00:49:46.720 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:49:48.790 --> 00:49:48.800 align:start position:0%
um yes and so
 
00:49:49.990 --> 00:49:50.000 align:start position:0%
you know to build off of what
 
00:49:51.910 --> 00:49:51.920 align:start position:0%
representative lane said once again not
 
00:49:53.589 --> 00:49:53.599 align:start position:0%
really fair to ask you about a map you
 
00:49:56.150 --> 00:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
didn't draw um i see it's not stopping
 
00:49:58.150 --> 00:49:58.160 align:start position:0%
you in the least representative barry so
 
00:49:58.160 --> 00:50:00.150 align:start position:0%
you in the least representative barry so
proceed

00:50:00.150 --> 00:50:00.160 align:start position:0%
proceed
 
00:50:01.589 --> 00:50:01.599 align:start position:0%
i think i'm known i think i'm known for
 
00:50:01.599 --> 00:50:03.829 align:start position:0%
i think i'm known i think i'm known for
that

00:50:03.829 --> 00:50:03.839 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:50:07.270 --> 00:50:07.280 align:start position:0%
the federal government doles out money
 
00:50:09.430 --> 00:50:09.440 align:start position:0%
based on counties and county government
 
00:50:11.589 --> 00:50:11.599 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire is notoriously weak
 
00:50:13.109 --> 00:50:13.119 align:start position:0%
they basically handle the sheriff's
 
00:50:15.910 --> 00:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
office the district courts uh and the
 
00:50:17.990 --> 00:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
nursing homes and they'll and then
 
00:50:19.349 --> 00:50:19.359 align:start position:0%
basically they hand out federal money in
 
00:50:20.630 --> 00:50:20.640 align:start position:0%
fact we have a hillsborough county
 
00:50:21.910 --> 00:50:21.920 align:start position:0%
delegation meeting coming up to discuss
 
00:50:24.069 --> 00:50:24.079 align:start position:0%
arbor funding which is doled out via the
 
00:50:24.079 --> 00:50:25.349 align:start position:0%
arbor funding which is doled out via the
counties

00:50:25.349 --> 00:50:25.359 align:start position:0%
counties
 
00:50:27.030 --> 00:50:27.040 align:start position:0%
and much of the fed which
 
00:50:28.790 --> 00:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
much of what the federal government does
 
00:50:30.790 --> 00:50:30.800 align:start position:0%
is based on counties and while new
 
00:50:32.710 --> 00:50:32.720 align:start position:0%
hampshire doesn't do that really the
 
00:50:34.710 --> 00:50:34.720 align:start position:0%
federal government does so
 
00:50:37.670 --> 00:50:37.680 align:start position:0%
in the original 1880 map
 
00:50:40.069 --> 00:50:40.079 align:start position:0%
we new hampshire only split two counties
 
00:50:42.309 --> 00:50:42.319 align:start position:0%
they split merrimack county
 
00:50:44.790 --> 00:50:44.800 align:start position:0%
and hillsborough county
 
00:50:47.030 --> 00:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
the proposed map
 
00:50:48.630 --> 00:50:48.640 align:start position:0%
by governor sununu we'll start with the
 
00:50:51.190 --> 00:50:51.200 align:start position:0%
present day map splits grafton county
 
00:50:53.670 --> 00:50:53.680 align:start position:0%
merrimack county merrimack county i'm
 
00:50:55.750 --> 00:50:55.760 align:start position:0%
sorry sorry belknap county merrimack
 
00:50:57.430 --> 00:50:57.440 align:start position:0%
county rockingham county and
 
00:50:59.589 --> 00:50:59.599 align:start position:0%
hillsborough county so one two three
 
00:51:01.270 --> 00:51:01.280 align:start position:0%
four five counties
 
00:51:03.750 --> 00:51:03.760 align:start position:0%
and governor sununu's map all splits one
 
00:51:07.030 --> 00:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
two three four counties um so 40 percent
 
00:51:09.349 --> 00:51:09.359 align:start position:0%
of the counties in the state are broken
 
00:51:11.910 --> 00:51:11.920 align:start position:0%
up um the original map once again
 
00:51:14.790 --> 00:51:14.800 align:start position:0%
was two counties so my question is is in
 
00:51:16.150 --> 00:51:16.160 align:start position:0%
taking into consideration the fact that
 
00:51:17.990 --> 00:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
federal government doles out money by
 
00:51:20.549 --> 00:51:20.559 align:start position:0%
county was there a consideration in
 
00:51:22.150 --> 00:51:22.160 align:start position:0%
place to keep counties together given
 
00:51:23.430 --> 00:51:23.440 align:start position:0%
that that's how the federal government
 
00:51:25.030 --> 00:51:25.040 align:start position:0%
this is a congressional map doles out
 
00:51:27.510 --> 00:51:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:29.030 --> 00:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
i can't say whether that was a
 
00:51:31.750 --> 00:51:31.760 align:start position:0%
consideration in drawing the map but it
 
00:51:34.790 --> 00:51:34.800 align:start position:0%
certainly would appear that the result
 
00:51:37.430 --> 00:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
has some county differences that would
 
00:51:40.390 --> 00:51:40.400 align:start position:0%
be impossible to deal with as an entire
 
00:51:42.549 --> 00:51:42.559 align:start position:0%
entity i i would point out that
 
00:51:45.589 --> 00:51:45.599 align:start position:0%
um there is county money from the feds
 
00:51:48.549 --> 00:51:48.559 align:start position:0%
there is transportation money for
 
00:51:51.829 --> 00:51:51.839 align:start position:0%
new construction uh franconia notch
 
00:51:54.950 --> 00:51:54.960 align:start position:0%
um i-93 is the one we're most certainly
 
00:51:58.069 --> 00:51:58.079 align:start position:0%
familiar with um and there's also
 
00:52:00.470 --> 00:52:00.480 align:start position:0%
um money that comes in
 
00:52:02.549 --> 00:52:02.559 align:start position:0%
not necessarily by county but through
 
00:52:02.559 --> 00:52:04.390 align:start position:0%
not necessarily by county but through
hhs

00:52:04.390 --> 00:52:04.400 align:start position:0%
hhs
 
00:52:06.309 --> 00:52:06.319 align:start position:0%
which of course goes to
 
00:52:07.990 --> 00:52:08.000 align:start position:0%
some of our
 
00:52:13.750 --> 00:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:14.950 --> 00:52:14.960 align:start position:0%
i can keep going but somebody else wants
 
00:52:16.549 --> 00:52:16.559 align:start position:0%
to ask a question
 
00:52:20.790 --> 00:52:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:24.069 --> 00:52:24.079 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chairman smith
 
00:52:24.079 --> 00:52:24.950 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chairman smith
um

00:52:24.950 --> 00:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:27.829 --> 00:52:27.839 align:start position:0%
before i ask a question could anyone
 
00:52:29.349 --> 00:52:29.359 align:start position:0%
help me
 
00:52:33.430 --> 00:52:33.440 align:start position:0%
understand what this appendage is on the
 
00:52:36.630 --> 00:52:36.640 align:start position:0%
southeast border
 
00:52:41.670 --> 00:52:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:43.829 --> 00:52:43.839 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm assuming that's the
 
00:52:46.470 --> 00:52:46.480 align:start position:0%
the battled over territorial isle of
 
00:52:49.030 --> 00:52:49.040 align:start position:0%
shoals area that we
 
00:52:53.510 --> 00:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:56.069 --> 00:52:56.079 align:start position:0%
but i think the county i think that's
 
00:52:58.390 --> 00:52:58.400 align:start position:0%
that's what i presumed i take the county
 
00:53:00.549 --> 00:53:00.559 align:start position:0%
line as being the the state border with
 
00:53:02.069 --> 00:53:02.079 align:start position:0%
the with the
 
00:53:04.870 --> 00:53:04.880 align:start position:0%
yeah that that is not the uh the other
 
00:53:06.870 --> 00:53:06.880 align:start position:0%
shows it's a little big for the isles of
 
00:53:08.470 --> 00:53:08.480 align:start position:0%
shows yeah and it's also not in the
 
00:53:10.069 --> 00:53:10.079 align:start position:0%
right place but other than that it's
 
00:53:10.079 --> 00:53:10.870 align:start position:0%
right place but other than that it's
fine

00:53:10.870 --> 00:53:10.880 align:start position:0%
fine
 
00:53:12.950 --> 00:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
um i just um because i know all right
 
00:53:14.790 --> 00:53:14.800 align:start position:0%
there you go there's pictures for maps
 
00:53:17.109 --> 00:53:17.119 align:start position:0%
for you i noticed that it's on the
 
00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:20.640 align:start position:0%
governor's map and also well well both
 
00:53:22.230 --> 00:53:22.240 align:start position:0%
of the governor's maps i guess because
 
00:53:23.670 --> 00:53:23.680 align:start position:0%
they are the same
 
00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:24.470 align:start position:0%
they are the same
um

00:53:24.470 --> 00:53:24.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:25.430 align:start position:0%
um
uh

00:53:25.430 --> 00:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:53:27.670 --> 00:53:27.680 align:start position:0%
i actually didn't know until just
 
00:53:29.829 --> 00:53:29.839 align:start position:0%
moments before that you
 
00:53:33.030 --> 00:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
had an msw which shows why you're so
 
00:53:34.710 --> 00:53:34.720 align:start position:0%
good with your people skills dealing
 
00:53:36.390 --> 00:53:36.400 align:start position:0%
with difficult people
 
00:53:38.710 --> 00:53:38.720 align:start position:0%
but you also i know have a law degree
 
00:53:42.630 --> 00:53:42.640 align:start position:0%
and i wonder um as you've looked at the
 
00:53:45.349 --> 00:53:45.359 align:start position:0%
changes over the years
 
00:53:48.870 --> 00:53:48.880 align:start position:0%
whether you took into consideration um
 
00:53:51.910 --> 00:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
baker versus carr which i think was 62
 
00:53:54.870 --> 00:53:54.880 align:start position:0%
if i remember and westbury v sanders
 
00:53:56.950 --> 00:53:56.960 align:start position:0%
which was 64
 
00:54:00.790 --> 00:54:00.800 align:start position:0%
in which we have to have
 
00:54:04.870 --> 00:54:04.880 align:start position:0%
equal population or as equal as possible
 
00:54:06.230 --> 00:54:06.240 align:start position:0%
and i wonder if those were
 
00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:08.150 align:start position:0%
and i wonder if those were
considerations

00:54:08.150 --> 00:54:08.160 align:start position:0%
considerations
 
00:54:10.470 --> 00:54:10.480 align:start position:0%
that were taken in terms of drawing
 
00:54:12.390 --> 00:54:12.400 align:start position:0%
these maps
 
00:54:14.230 --> 00:54:14.240 align:start position:0%
i presumed that those were
 
00:54:16.870 --> 00:54:16.880 align:start position:0%
considerations in drawing these maps but
 
00:54:19.829 --> 00:54:19.839 align:start position:0%
given the population shift
 
00:54:23.030 --> 00:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
that would exist today the population
 
00:54:26.069 --> 00:54:26.079 align:start position:0%
deviation that would exist today
 
00:54:28.549 --> 00:54:28.559 align:start position:0%
from the 1880 map
 
00:54:31.270 --> 00:54:31.280 align:start position:0%
my question became why would i continue
 
00:54:33.349 --> 00:54:33.359 align:start position:0%
to use a map that used that as a
 
00:54:34.790 --> 00:54:34.800 align:start position:0%
starting point
 
00:54:38.630 --> 00:54:38.640 align:start position:0%
if i could just follow up i don't think
 
00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:39.670 align:start position:0%
if i could just follow up i don't think
oh

00:54:39.670 --> 00:54:39.680 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:54:41.990 --> 00:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry could i follow up mr chair
 
00:54:43.270 --> 00:54:43.280 align:start position:0%
sure thing
 
00:54:47.349 --> 00:54:47.359 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i appreciate that um
 
00:54:51.430 --> 00:54:51.440 align:start position:0%
i'm not i'm curious as to several
 
00:54:53.030 --> 00:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
mentions have been made
 
00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:54.470 align:start position:0%
mentions have been made
of

00:54:54.470 --> 00:54:54.480 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:54:57.510 --> 00:54:57.520 align:start position:0%
the appearance of a commitment
 
00:55:00.069 --> 00:55:00.079 align:start position:0%
to that which has gone
 
00:55:02.789 --> 00:55:02.799 align:start position:0%
before i'm not sure
 
00:55:06.309 --> 00:55:06.319 align:start position:0%
that that's an accurate reflection of
 
00:55:09.270 --> 00:55:09.280 align:start position:0%
how maps were drawn during this whole
 
00:55:11.829 --> 00:55:11.839 align:start position:0%
process i know that the map
 
00:55:13.910 --> 00:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:55:16.950 --> 00:55:16.960 align:start position:0%
the democratic members of this committee
 
00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:18.549 align:start position:0%
the democratic members of this committee
submitted

00:55:18.549 --> 00:55:18.559 align:start position:0%
submitted
 
00:55:18.559 --> 00:55:20.549 align:start position:0%
submitted
um

00:55:20.549 --> 00:55:20.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:22.630 --> 00:55:22.640 align:start position:0%
was a map that
 
00:55:24.710 --> 00:55:24.720 align:start position:0%
and this is a question i mean was a map
 
00:55:26.870 --> 00:55:26.880 align:start position:0%
that certainly
 
00:55:29.270 --> 00:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
considered that which has gone before
 
00:55:32.630 --> 00:55:32.640 align:start position:0%
but ended up with population i think of
 
00:55:35.109 --> 00:55:35.119 align:start position:0%
deviation of 50 if i
 
00:55:37.190 --> 00:55:37.200 align:start position:0%
if i remember correctly
 
00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:40.480 align:start position:0%
um and that an attempt was made to
 
00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:41.990 align:start position:0%
um and that an attempt was made to
follow

00:55:41.990 --> 00:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
follow
 
00:55:44.390 --> 00:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
the legal requirements
 
00:55:47.190 --> 00:55:47.200 align:start position:0%
and since we don't begin with a blank
 
00:55:47.200 --> 00:55:49.670 align:start position:0%
and since we don't begin with a blank
slate

00:55:49.670 --> 00:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
slate
 
00:55:51.670 --> 00:55:51.680 align:start position:0%
you know we're not going back to zero
 
00:55:54.549 --> 00:55:54.559 align:start position:0%
each time um you begin with what you
 
00:55:56.309 --> 00:55:56.319 align:start position:0%
have and then you see how do you change
 
00:55:58.870 --> 00:55:58.880 align:start position:0%
that to make sure you're meeting
 
00:56:01.190 --> 00:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
legal requirements tell me what's wrong
 
00:56:03.750 --> 00:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
with that approach
 
00:56:06.069 --> 00:56:06.079 align:start position:0%
representative smith i would not presume
 
00:56:07.430 --> 00:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
to speak to
 
00:56:09.990 --> 00:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
the bases of what other members might
 
00:56:11.750 --> 00:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
have proposed and why unless it's on the
 
00:56:13.430 --> 00:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
record and people can review the record
 
00:56:15.670 --> 00:56:15.680 align:start position:0%
for itself i would simply comment on
 
00:56:18.069 --> 00:56:18.079 align:start position:0%
your last section of last statement
 
00:56:20.789 --> 00:56:20.799 align:start position:0%
which is we don't start from zero or
 
00:56:22.710 --> 00:56:22.720 align:start position:0%
scratch and i would go back to what i
 
00:56:25.030 --> 00:56:25.040 align:start position:0%
previously said in regards to the
 
00:56:26.710 --> 00:56:26.720 align:start position:0%
freshman member of a budget committee
 
00:56:29.109 --> 00:56:29.119 align:start position:0%
who asks why am i not starting to create
 
00:56:31.829 --> 00:56:31.839 align:start position:0%
this budget from zero based on need and
 
00:56:34.710 --> 00:56:34.720 align:start position:0%
what fits the needs today as compared to
 
00:56:37.510 --> 00:56:37.520 align:start position:0%
working off the budget of yesteryear and
 
00:56:39.270 --> 00:56:39.280 align:start position:0%
deciding what needs to be changed
 
00:56:41.430 --> 00:56:41.440 align:start position:0%
there's simply two different approaches
 
00:56:43.990 --> 00:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
in an exercise that needs to be done on
 
00:56:45.829 --> 00:56:45.839 align:start position:0%
your municipal and state level from a
 
00:56:49.190 --> 00:56:49.200 align:start position:0%
financial standpoint and every 10 years
 
00:56:51.750 --> 00:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
in regards to districting and i and i
 
00:56:53.750 --> 00:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
certainly would defer to you as to
 
00:56:55.670 --> 00:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
considerations of what have gone on in
 
00:56:58.470 --> 00:56:58.480 align:start position:0%
previous cons previous mapping exercises
 
00:56:59.990 --> 00:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
in this state as i know you have been
 
00:57:03.030 --> 00:57:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:08.230 --> 00:57:08.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:10.549 --> 00:57:10.559 align:start position:0%
all right so we've kept her up there for
 
00:57:12.470 --> 00:57:12.480 align:start position:0%
25 minutes and it's kind of starting to
 
00:57:15.190 --> 00:57:15.200 align:start position:0%
feel like a work session to me so
 
00:57:17.829 --> 00:57:17.839 align:start position:0%
representative turcotte
 
00:57:19.670 --> 00:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you again
 
00:57:21.190 --> 00:57:21.200 align:start position:0%
for taking the question
 
00:57:22.789 --> 00:57:22.799 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of this entire
 
00:57:24.870 --> 00:57:24.880 align:start position:0%
redistricting process members of this
 
00:57:27.190 --> 00:57:27.200 align:start position:0%
committee were given an extraordinary
 
00:57:29.910 --> 00:57:29.920 align:start position:0%
extraordinary amount of reading material
 
00:57:31.190 --> 00:57:31.200 align:start position:0%
based on
 
00:57:34.789 --> 00:57:34.799 align:start position:0%
previous state and federal court cases
 
00:57:36.950 --> 00:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
i just like to ask your opinion on this
 
00:57:40.390 --> 00:57:40.400 align:start position:0%
particular map that if it went uh if it
 
00:57:43.349 --> 00:57:43.359 align:start position:0%
was challenged in court
 
00:57:47.270 --> 00:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:47.280 --> 00:57:52.069 align:start position:0%
 
found

00:57:52.069 --> 00:57:52.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:54.470 --> 00:57:54.480 align:start position:0%
on the deviation alone would that be
 
00:57:56.630 --> 00:57:56.640 align:start position:0%
enough to have this
 
00:57:59.510 --> 00:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
map thrown thrown out
 
00:58:01.349 --> 00:58:01.359 align:start position:0%
uh i would not presume to say what i
 
00:58:03.349 --> 00:58:03.359 align:start position:0%
think the judicial branch would do with
 
00:58:05.990 --> 00:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
what is a legislative branch function
 
00:58:07.990 --> 00:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
um but i certainly know that would be a
 
00:58:10.789 --> 00:58:10.799 align:start position:0%
consideration that would be briefed
 
00:58:15.109 --> 00:58:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:18.630 --> 00:58:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:19.670 --> 00:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
i was just
 
00:58:22.150 --> 00:58:22.160 align:start position:0%
wondering representative i can't tell
 
00:58:23.990 --> 00:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
from your testimony whether you actually
 
00:58:26.630 --> 00:58:26.640 align:start position:0%
support this particular proposal can you
 
00:58:26.640 --> 00:58:30.309 align:start position:0%
support this particular proposal can you
clarify

00:58:30.309 --> 00:58:30.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:32.789 --> 00:58:32.799 align:start position:0%
i think we can do better
 
00:58:34.230 --> 00:58:34.240 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:58:35.270 --> 00:58:35.280 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:58:37.030 --> 00:58:37.040 align:start position:0%
is it your intention then
 
00:58:39.990 --> 00:58:40.000 align:start position:0%
to offer additional amendments at next
 
00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:41.510 align:start position:0%
to offer additional amendments at next
week's

00:58:41.510 --> 00:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
week's
 
00:58:42.870 --> 00:58:42.880 align:start position:0%
uh meeting
 
00:58:45.670 --> 00:58:45.680 align:start position:0%
well it's my intention at some point if
 
00:58:47.190 --> 00:58:47.200 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on this amendment
 
00:58:49.589 --> 00:58:49.599 align:start position:0%
ends is to resume my status as chair of
 
00:58:51.990 --> 00:58:52.000 align:start position:0%
this committee and then to announce that
 
00:58:53.829 --> 00:58:53.839 align:start position:0%
since we have another executive session
 
00:58:55.990 --> 00:58:56.000 align:start position:0%
that i'm hoping that members will feel
 
00:58:59.109 --> 00:58:59.119 align:start position:0%
free to bring forward further amendments
 
00:59:01.430 --> 00:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
um and get them into the
 
00:59:03.510 --> 00:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
to the body in order that they can be
 
00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:04.470 align:start position:0%
to the body in order that they can be
noticed

00:59:04.470 --> 00:59:04.480 align:start position:0%
noticed
 
00:59:06.789 --> 00:59:06.799 align:start position:0%
online at least a day before our
 
00:59:10.549 --> 00:59:10.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:12.230 --> 00:59:12.240 align:start position:0%
representative barry thank you mr
 
00:59:13.270 --> 00:59:13.280 align:start position:0%
chairman this will uh thank you for the
 
00:59:15.270 --> 00:59:15.280 align:start position:0%
indulgence this will be my last one so
 
00:59:17.910 --> 00:59:17.920 align:start position:0%
not to enter into a work session
 
00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman
 
00:59:22.309 --> 00:59:22.319 align:start position:0%
looking at the proposed amendment it
 
00:59:24.789 --> 00:59:24.799 align:start position:0%
looks like the only economic community
 
00:59:27.670 --> 00:59:27.680 align:start position:0%
that is kept together by this map is the
 
00:59:27.680 --> 00:59:29.270 align:start position:0%
that is kept together by this map is the
seacoast

00:59:29.270 --> 00:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
seacoast
 
00:59:32.789 --> 00:59:32.799 align:start position:0%
and when you look at the 1880 proposal
 
00:59:32.799 --> 00:59:33.670 align:start position:0%
and when you look at the 1880 proposal
um

00:59:33.670 --> 00:59:33.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:35.190 --> 00:59:35.200 align:start position:0%
1880 congressional map that kept
 
00:59:37.510 --> 00:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
together the sea coast uh all of the
 
00:59:38.789 --> 00:59:38.799 align:start position:0%
lakes region
 
00:59:38.799 --> 00:59:39.910 align:start position:0%
lakes region
um

00:59:39.910 --> 00:59:39.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:41.349 --> 00:59:41.359 align:start position:0%
and if you also understand the
 
00:59:42.950 --> 00:59:42.960 align:start position:0%
populations it kept basically kind of
 
00:59:45.030 --> 00:59:45.040 align:start position:0%
your major population centers together
 
00:59:47.829 --> 00:59:47.839 align:start position:0%
um because populations have changed over
 
00:59:50.630 --> 00:59:50.640 align:start position:0%
the last 18 of the last 100 and quick
 
00:59:52.870 --> 00:59:52.880 align:start position:0%
math 40 years um my question is about
 
00:59:54.309 --> 00:59:54.319 align:start position:0%
the proposal
 
00:59:56.069 --> 00:59:56.079 align:start position:0%
it looks like only the seacoast together
 
00:59:58.390 --> 00:59:58.400 align:start position:0%
so why weren't more economic communities
 
00:59:59.910 --> 00:59:59.920 align:start position:0%
considered in this why wasn't the
 
01:00:01.589 --> 01:00:01.599 align:start position:0%
greater manchester community considered
 
01:00:03.190 --> 01:00:03.200 align:start position:0%
why wasn't the greater concord community
 
01:00:05.190 --> 01:00:05.200 align:start position:0%
considered why is the lakes region
 
01:00:07.670 --> 01:00:07.680 align:start position:0%
broken up um with the loss of center
 
01:00:09.829 --> 01:00:09.839 align:start position:0%
harbor do you have it were you given an
 
01:00:11.190 --> 01:00:11.200 align:start position:0%
explanation about why these major
 
01:00:13.349 --> 01:00:13.359 align:start position:0%
economic communities were separated
 
01:00:15.430 --> 01:00:15.440 align:start position:0%
as i said i've had no conversations with
 
01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
the governor at all in regards to
 
01:00:18.789 --> 01:00:18.799 align:start position:0%
consideration of this map
 
01:00:20.470 --> 01:00:20.480 align:start position:0%
um but i would like to say to the
 
01:00:21.670 --> 01:00:21.680 align:start position:0%
committee i think that question
 
01:00:23.270 --> 01:00:23.280 align:start position:0%
highlights what you've all done and i
 
01:00:24.950 --> 01:00:24.960 align:start position:0%
want to thank you all for your work
 
01:00:27.109 --> 01:00:27.119 align:start position:0%
because um simply dealing with the
 
01:00:29.829 --> 01:00:29.839 align:start position:0%
population and the program that we had
 
01:00:32.390 --> 01:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
which worked i think quite well
 
01:00:34.069 --> 01:00:34.079 align:start position:0%
didn't really give you a huge amount of
 
01:00:36.230 --> 01:00:36.240 align:start position:0%
information other than
 
01:00:38.230 --> 01:00:38.240 align:start position:0%
a district number and what population
 
01:00:43.270 --> 01:00:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:44.870 --> 01:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative griffin thank
 
01:00:46.470 --> 01:00:46.480 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you to the members
 
01:00:49.190 --> 01:00:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:50.470 --> 01:00:50.480 align:start position:0%
next up
 
01:00:51.990 --> 01:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
representative horrigan on support of
 
01:00:59.750 --> 01:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:01.109 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:01:01.109 --> 01:01:01.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:03.270 --> 01:01:03.280 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair and um so
 
01:01:04.710 --> 01:01:04.720 align:start position:0%
i'm representing timothy horrigan from
 
01:01:06.549 --> 01:01:06.559 align:start position:0%
stratfor county's district six the towns
 
01:01:08.630 --> 01:01:08.640 align:start position:0%
of durham and madbury the same
 
01:01:10.950 --> 01:01:10.960 align:start position:0%
district uh represented by the other
 
01:01:12.789 --> 01:01:12.799 align:start position:0%
representative smith
 
01:01:14.150 --> 01:01:14.160 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:01:15.270 --> 01:01:15.280 align:start position:0%
so it
 
01:01:17.190 --> 01:01:17.200 align:start position:0%
it pains me to to agree with the
 
01:01:19.030 --> 01:01:19.040 align:start position:0%
governor probably almost as much as it
 
01:01:21.430 --> 01:01:21.440 align:start position:0%
pains you to have to rewrite the
 
01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:23.440 align:start position:0%
congressional district map but i think
 
01:01:25.670 --> 01:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
this um
 
01:01:26.870 --> 01:01:26.880 align:start position:0%
i guess the senate redistricting
 
01:01:28.470 --> 01:01:28.480 align:start position:0%
committee was probably like even more
 
01:01:30.309 --> 01:01:30.319 align:start position:0%
imaginative you were but we've seen some
 
01:01:32.549 --> 01:01:32.559 align:start position:0%
rather imaginative maps being drawn this
 
01:01:34.549 --> 01:01:34.559 align:start position:0%
year especially um
 
01:01:35.750 --> 01:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about the executive
 
01:01:37.270 --> 01:01:37.280 align:start position:0%
council map but i
 
01:01:39.030 --> 01:01:39.040 align:start position:0%
still scratching my head over that one
 
01:01:40.789 --> 01:01:40.799 align:start position:0%
even though we voted on it yesterday but
 
01:01:42.309 --> 01:01:42.319 align:start position:0%
this is a
 
01:01:42.319 --> 01:01:43.109 align:start position:0%
this is a
um

01:01:43.109 --> 01:01:43.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:44.309 --> 01:01:44.319 align:start position:0%
very uh
 
01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
compact map um it
 
01:01:48.950 --> 01:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
depending on how you look at it either
 
01:01:52.069 --> 01:01:52.079 align:start position:0%
fails to split um
 
01:01:54.870 --> 01:01:54.880 align:start position:0%
uh six out of the states ten counties or
 
01:01:57.190 --> 01:01:57.200 align:start position:0%
it keeps ten six of the ten counties
 
01:01:59.589 --> 01:01:59.599 align:start position:0%
intact and it only makes
 
01:02:02.230 --> 01:02:02.240 align:start position:0%
pretty minor changes to belknap it just
 
01:02:04.230 --> 01:02:04.240 align:start position:0%
takes the small town of center harbor
 
01:02:05.910 --> 01:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
out of there presumably make the numbers
 
01:02:08.390 --> 01:02:08.400 align:start position:0%
work better and
 
01:02:09.990 --> 01:02:10.000 align:start position:0%
even carroll county only takes for
 
01:02:11.990 --> 01:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
communities what's going with hillsboro
 
01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
is they're taking
 
01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:14.309 align:start position:0%
is they're taking
um

01:02:14.309 --> 01:02:14.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:16.230 --> 01:02:16.240 align:start position:0%
i'm telling you something probably you
 
01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:16.950 align:start position:0%
i'm telling you something probably you
all

01:02:16.950 --> 01:02:16.960 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:02:18.309 --> 01:02:18.319 align:start position:0%
can see for yourselves but they're
 
01:02:20.630 --> 01:02:20.640 align:start position:0%
taking manchester and goffstown and
 
01:02:22.069 --> 01:02:22.079 align:start position:0%
immediately they're putting the
 
01:02:24.789 --> 01:02:24.799 align:start position:0%
immediate environs of manchester in
 
01:02:28.390 --> 01:02:28.400 align:start position:0%
in cd1 which is where they've been for
 
01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:29.270 align:start position:0%
in cd1 which is where they've been for
over

01:02:29.270 --> 01:02:29.280 align:start position:0%
over
 
01:02:31.349 --> 01:02:31.359 align:start position:0%
almost a century and a half now and also
 
01:02:35.109 --> 01:02:35.119 align:start position:0%
which also means that uh the uh the
 
01:02:37.190 --> 01:02:37.200 align:start position:0%
incumbent can continue to run in the
 
01:02:38.789 --> 01:02:38.799 align:start position:0%
district that he lives in and all the
 
01:02:40.549 --> 01:02:40.559 align:start position:0%
many candidates on the other side are
 
01:02:40.559 --> 01:02:41.589 align:start position:0%
many candidates on the other side are
running

01:02:41.589 --> 01:02:41.599 align:start position:0%
running
 
01:02:43.670 --> 01:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
vying for the republican nomination um
 
01:02:45.510 --> 01:02:45.520 align:start position:0%
are also still living in the
 
01:02:48.789 --> 01:02:48.799 align:start position:0%
district that they lived in so that's um
 
01:02:50.230 --> 01:02:50.240 align:start position:0%
i mean if you uh
 
01:02:51.430 --> 01:02:51.440 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:02:53.589 --> 01:02:53.599 align:start position:0%
if for some reason you feel the need to
 
01:02:55.670 --> 01:02:55.680 align:start position:0%
split more counties you could probably
 
01:02:57.510 --> 01:02:57.520 align:start position:0%
put a couple towns in grafton or
 
01:02:59.270 --> 01:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
stratford like milton is right on the
 
01:03:00.870 --> 01:03:00.880 align:start position:0%
border if you want to
 
01:03:02.390 --> 01:03:02.400 align:start position:0%
do that while you're
 
01:03:03.990 --> 01:03:04.000 align:start position:0%
making the numbers come out better i
 
01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:05.109 align:start position:0%
making the numbers come out better i
think

01:03:05.109 --> 01:03:05.119 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:03:05.119 --> 01:03:06.069 align:start position:0%
think
um

01:03:06.069 --> 01:03:06.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:07.430 --> 01:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
which reminds me in terms of county
 
01:03:09.430 --> 01:03:09.440 align:start position:0%
government represent barry uh i'm not
 
01:03:10.950 --> 01:03:10.960 align:start position:0%
sure what he
 
01:03:13.430 --> 01:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
said was entirely correct i said on the
 
01:03:15.349 --> 01:03:15.359 align:start position:0%
judiciary committee
 
01:03:16.630 --> 01:03:16.640 align:start position:0%
here in concord i'm also the chair of
 
01:03:18.230 --> 01:03:18.240 align:start position:0%
the general government's subcommittee in
 
01:03:20.470 --> 01:03:20.480 align:start position:0%
stratfor county so we do a lot more than
 
01:03:22.230 --> 01:03:22.240 align:start position:0%
he um
 
01:03:24.630 --> 01:03:24.640 align:start position:0%
than he said said we did
 
01:03:26.549 --> 01:03:26.559 align:start position:0%
but on the other hand um we're not
 
01:03:28.069 --> 01:03:28.079 align:start position:0%
responsible at all for the courts the
 
01:03:30.069 --> 01:03:30.079 align:start position:0%
district well the superior court
 
01:03:32.069 --> 01:03:32.079 align:start position:0%
districts are drawn along county lines
 
01:03:33.589 --> 01:03:33.599 align:start position:0%
but they're they've
 
01:03:33.599 --> 01:03:34.549 align:start position:0%
but they're they've
for

01:03:34.549 --> 01:03:34.559 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:03:36.150 --> 01:03:36.160 align:start position:0%
we've reorganized the courts a number of
 
01:03:37.990 --> 01:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
years and they're now
 
01:03:40.390 --> 01:03:40.400 align:start position:0%
run by this at the state level same goes
 
01:03:41.910 --> 01:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
for all the district courts and most of
 
01:03:43.750 --> 01:03:43.760 align:start position:0%
those also obey counting lines but there
 
01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:45.029 align:start position:0%
those also obey counting lines but there
are

01:03:45.029 --> 01:03:45.039 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:03:46.789 --> 01:03:46.799 align:start position:0%
i think there are a few minor exceptions
 
01:03:48.630 --> 01:03:48.640 align:start position:0%
like i think there's a uh
 
01:03:51.029 --> 01:03:51.039 align:start position:0%
district in grafton county that bleeds
 
01:03:54.390 --> 01:03:54.400 align:start position:0%
over into carroll county but that's um
 
01:03:56.470 --> 01:03:56.480 align:start position:0%
i think respecting the county lines it's
 
01:03:59.029 --> 01:03:59.039 align:start position:0%
a good idea just because the voters they
 
01:04:01.109 --> 01:04:01.119 align:start position:0%
do have
 
01:04:03.270 --> 01:04:03.280 align:start position:0%
they still have some identity even um
 
01:04:04.710 --> 01:04:04.720 align:start position:0%
even if their government functions and
 
01:04:06.390 --> 01:04:06.400 align:start position:0%
not as much in other states but people
 
01:04:08.630 --> 01:04:08.640 align:start position:0%
do know which county they live in and
 
01:04:10.150 --> 01:04:10.160 align:start position:0%
especially if you're a political
 
01:04:11.750 --> 01:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
activist one of the two major parties
 
01:04:13.750 --> 01:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
like i am
 
01:04:14.630 --> 01:04:14.640 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:04:16.390 --> 01:04:16.400 align:start position:0%
which county committee is yours and so
 
01:04:17.990 --> 01:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
forth there's a lot of value to keeping
 
01:04:19.270 --> 01:04:19.280 align:start position:0%
the counties
 
01:04:20.789 --> 01:04:20.799 align:start position:0%
the counties intact in fact it'd
 
01:04:23.430 --> 01:04:23.440 align:start position:0%
probably be even possible to
 
01:04:25.589 --> 01:04:25.599 align:start position:0%
swap center harbor with some other town
 
01:04:27.510 --> 01:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
and then keep belknap county entirely
 
01:04:29.589 --> 01:04:29.599 align:start position:0%
within one congressional district and
 
01:04:32.309 --> 01:04:32.319 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:04:33.990 --> 01:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
sort of the old district i think the
 
01:04:36.150 --> 01:04:36.160 align:start position:0%
district the district of the governor i
 
01:04:37.910 --> 01:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
guess he hasn't actually vetoed it yet
 
01:04:40.150 --> 01:04:40.160 align:start position:0%
but everybody believes he is going to uh
 
01:04:42.309 --> 01:04:42.319 align:start position:0%
to veto it um
 
01:04:43.589 --> 01:04:43.599 align:start position:0%
split uh
 
01:04:46.710 --> 01:04:46.720 align:start position:0%
quite a few counties and um you know was
 
01:04:48.390 --> 01:04:48.400 align:start position:0%
just you know divided all kinds of
 
01:04:50.150 --> 01:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
communities together it was like pretty
 
01:04:51.530 --> 01:04:51.540 align:start position:0%
a huge departure from
 
01:04:51.540 --> 01:04:52.950 align:start position:0%
a huge departure from
[Music]

01:04:52.950 --> 01:04:52.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:04:54.950 --> 01:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
huge huge departure from how it's been
 
01:04:57.910 --> 01:04:57.920 align:start position:0%
in the past and i don't think um
 
01:04:59.829 --> 01:04:59.839 align:start position:0%
at least most of us most of us who
 
01:05:01.829 --> 01:05:01.839 align:start position:0%
aren't in the majority of the uh senator
 
01:05:03.349 --> 01:05:03.359 align:start position:0%
house redistricting committees have no
 
01:05:06.150 --> 01:05:06.160 align:start position:0%
idea why why you drew it that way it was
 
01:05:08.950 --> 01:05:08.960 align:start position:0%
um seemed very strange although
 
01:05:10.630 --> 01:05:10.640 align:start position:0%
regardless of how you draw it we have
 
01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:11.589 align:start position:0%
regardless of how you draw it we have
two

01:05:11.589 --> 01:05:11.599 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
very purple districts which um will be
 
01:05:15.990 --> 01:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
in play for either parties that you know
 
01:05:18.710 --> 01:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
i think probably you know the uh
 
01:05:20.789 --> 01:05:20.799 align:start position:0%
not the f2 parties in here or not about
 
01:05:22.150 --> 01:05:22.160 align:start position:0%
federal campaigns too much but you know
 
01:05:24.789 --> 01:05:24.799 align:start position:0%
the incumbent district one is a very
 
01:05:27.349 --> 01:05:27.359 align:start position:0%
he's very uh popular and strong uh
 
01:05:28.630 --> 01:05:28.640 align:start position:0%
figure he probably would have won just
 
01:05:30.309 --> 01:05:30.319 align:start position:0%
about any district we could have uh
 
01:05:33.990 --> 01:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
drawn for him so the um
 
01:05:35.750 --> 01:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
so i i definitely i've not talked to the
 
01:05:37.029 --> 01:05:37.039 align:start position:0%
governor about this the fact that
 
01:05:38.470 --> 01:05:38.480 align:start position:0%
governor and i
 
01:05:40.390 --> 01:05:40.400 align:start position:0%
um we know each other but we we never
 
01:05:43.029 --> 01:05:43.039 align:start position:0%
talk about anything actually like so he
 
01:05:45.349 --> 01:05:45.359 align:start position:0%
um so he definitely didn't talk to me
 
01:05:46.870 --> 01:05:46.880 align:start position:0%
i'm probably one of the last people the
 
01:05:48.309 --> 01:05:48.319 align:start position:0%
state house he would want to talk to me
 
01:05:50.630 --> 01:05:50.640 align:start position:0%
about it but wendy's
 
01:05:52.390 --> 01:05:52.400 align:start position:0%
i have a lot of respect for him and i
 
01:05:54.710 --> 01:05:54.720 align:start position:0%
think sometimes he does
 
01:05:56.069 --> 01:05:56.079 align:start position:0%
does something right and i think with
 
01:05:58.390 --> 01:05:58.400 align:start position:0%
this plan this is um this is something
 
01:06:00.069 --> 01:06:00.079 align:start position:0%
right it's the best it's a vast
 
01:06:02.309 --> 01:06:02.319 align:start position:0%
improvement over of the
 
01:06:03.990 --> 01:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
the previous plan and i would certainly
 
01:06:05.910 --> 01:06:05.920 align:start position:0%
urge you you know you can if you want to
 
01:06:07.109 --> 01:06:07.119 align:start position:0%
tweak it at me
 
01:06:09.109 --> 01:06:09.119 align:start position:0%
move a few towns around that might make
 
01:06:10.950 --> 01:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
it even better but um
 
01:06:13.270 --> 01:06:13.280 align:start position:0%
i think it's good as is and
 
01:06:14.789 --> 01:06:14.799 align:start position:0%
any plan you brought there'd be court
 
01:06:16.829 --> 01:06:16.839 align:start position:0%
challenges to you to it but i don't
 
01:06:19.270 --> 01:06:19.280 align:start position:0%
think uh i don't think this one is more
 
01:06:21.670 --> 01:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
likely to be challenged if it has
 
01:06:24.870 --> 01:06:24.880 align:start position:0%
a deviation of 1200 as was set today or
 
01:06:26.789 --> 01:06:26.799 align:start position:0%
whatever it is rather than 88 so that
 
01:06:29.349 --> 01:06:29.359 align:start position:0%
that's not enough to get the plan um
 
01:06:32.950 --> 01:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
planned thrown out in federal court and
 
01:06:36.150 --> 01:06:36.160 align:start position:0%
finally i might add i read today that 46
 
01:06:37.990 --> 01:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
out of the 50 states have done their
 
01:06:39.990 --> 01:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
congressional redistricting plan and
 
01:06:42.150 --> 01:06:42.160 align:start position:0%
many of them have a much more difficult
 
01:06:43.430 --> 01:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
task because
 
01:06:45.270 --> 01:06:45.280 align:start position:0%
we're one of the few states where we
 
01:06:46.870 --> 01:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
have to stick with the municipal and
 
01:06:48.950 --> 01:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
city ward boundaries most states can go
 
01:06:50.789 --> 01:06:50.799 align:start position:0%
down to the block level which uh you
 
01:06:52.870 --> 01:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
know adds makes the whole several orders
 
01:06:55.270 --> 01:06:55.280 align:start position:0%
of magnitude more complicated
 
01:06:57.589 --> 01:06:57.599 align:start position:0%
um god help us if we had to do a plan
 
01:06:59.910 --> 01:06:59.920 align:start position:0%
that went down to the block level um
 
01:07:02.230 --> 01:07:02.240 align:start position:0%
we'd probably never get it done so we're
 
01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:03.589 align:start position:0%
we'd probably never get it done so we're
so

01:07:03.589 --> 01:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:07:04.870 --> 01:07:04.880 align:start position:0%
even though we're the greatest state in
 
01:07:06.309 --> 01:07:06.319 align:start position:0%
the union with the greatest legislature
 
01:07:08.069 --> 01:07:08.079 align:start position:0%
it does sort of uh surprise me a little
 
01:07:09.029 --> 01:07:09.039 align:start position:0%
bit that
 
01:07:11.829 --> 01:07:11.839 align:start position:0%
we're lagging behind 46 other states
 
01:07:13.589 --> 01:07:13.599 align:start position:0%
when we only really have
 
01:07:15.349 --> 01:07:15.359 align:start position:0%
two districts to draw and no matter how
 
01:07:17.349 --> 01:07:17.359 align:start position:0%
we draw them um
 
01:07:18.710 --> 01:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
you know we're not
 
01:07:20.470 --> 01:07:20.480 align:start position:0%
no matter how hard we try to gerrymander
 
01:07:21.750 --> 01:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
those two districts just because of the
 
01:07:24.470 --> 01:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
way representative yes so it's not
 
01:07:26.069 --> 01:07:26.079 align:start position:0%
proper to assume that anybody in the
 
01:07:27.990 --> 01:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
room is attempting to gerrymandering i
 
01:07:30.069 --> 01:07:30.079 align:start position:0%
understand the process is long and if
 
01:07:31.670 --> 01:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
you could loop your comments back into
 
01:07:33.430 --> 01:07:33.440 align:start position:0%
the amendment before us oh well let's
 
01:07:35.670 --> 01:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
it's going on on the national scene is
 
01:07:37.510 --> 01:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
not a topic well it's an excellent
 
01:07:39.109 --> 01:07:39.119 align:start position:0%
amendment um i think it's a great
 
01:07:40.789 --> 01:07:40.799 align:start position:0%
improvement over the previous plan and
 
01:07:40.799 --> 01:07:41.829 align:start position:0%
improvement over the previous plan and
certainly

01:07:41.829 --> 01:07:41.839 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
01:07:41.839 --> 01:07:42.950 align:start position:0%
certainly
even

01:07:42.950 --> 01:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
even
 
01:07:44.710 --> 01:07:44.720 align:start position:0%
even the version we passed in the house
 
01:07:46.390 --> 01:07:46.400 align:start position:0%
was probably not unconstitutional i
 
01:07:47.750 --> 01:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
believe it probably would withstand a
 
01:07:50.230 --> 01:07:50.240 align:start position:0%
score challenge but this one um
 
01:07:52.230 --> 01:07:52.240 align:start position:0%
this one is also not unconstitutional
 
01:07:53.589 --> 01:07:53.599 align:start position:0%
also i believe would not withstand a
 
01:07:55.190 --> 01:07:55.200 align:start position:0%
court challenge and i think it's i think
 
01:07:56.789 --> 01:07:56.799 align:start position:0%
it's better than
 
01:07:58.549 --> 01:07:58.559 align:start position:0%
what we're looking at so
 
01:08:00.390 --> 01:08:00.400 align:start position:0%
hopefully that's uh
 
01:08:01.990 --> 01:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
hopefully that's an acceptable comment
 
01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:06.870 align:start position:0%
hopefully that's an acceptable comment
so

01:08:06.870 --> 01:08:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:09.109 --> 01:08:09.119 align:start position:0%
thank you anybody thanks so
 
01:08:10.549 --> 01:08:10.559 align:start position:0%
as i said i definitely didn't talk to
 
01:08:12.630 --> 01:08:12.640 align:start position:0%
the governor about this and
 
01:08:15.270 --> 01:08:15.280 align:start position:0%
thanks questions from the committee
 
01:08:26.630 --> 01:08:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:31.189 --> 01:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:48.789 --> 01:08:48.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:51.189 --> 01:08:51.199 align:start position:0%
good morning vice chair

my name's coreen dodge
 
01:09:00.070 --> 01:09:00.080 align:start position:0%
maybe i should do this
 
01:09:01.990 --> 01:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
and i vote in derry
 
01:09:04.950 --> 01:09:04.960 align:start position:0%
for the record i am an independent voter
 
01:09:07.590 --> 01:09:07.600 align:start position:0%
i vote for candidates who i believe will
 
01:09:09.910 --> 01:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
represent me
 
01:09:11.829 --> 01:09:11.839 align:start position:0%
i am not going to speak to you today
 
01:09:14.789 --> 01:09:14.799 align:start position:0%
about deviations and statistics
 
01:09:17.510 --> 01:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
and map making skills because
 
01:09:20.390 --> 01:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
i really don't know a lot about it
 
01:09:21.669 --> 01:09:21.679 align:start position:0%
i'm going to be speaking to you as a
 
01:09:21.679 --> 01:09:23.749 align:start position:0%
i'm going to be speaking to you as a
voter

01:09:23.749 --> 01:09:23.759 align:start position:0%
voter
 
01:09:25.510 --> 01:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
and how
 
01:09:28.149 --> 01:09:28.159 align:start position:0%
whatever district redistricting maps you
 
01:09:30.950 --> 01:09:30.960 align:start position:0%
come up with how they will affect people
 
01:09:32.630 --> 01:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
like myself
 
01:09:34.550 --> 01:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
independent voters
 
01:09:39.990 --> 01:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:43.269 --> 01:09:43.279 align:start position:0%
we expect our vote to be counted fairly
 
01:09:48.870 --> 01:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:50.950 --> 01:09:50.960 align:start position:0%
government governor sununu's statement
 
01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:52.550 align:start position:0%
government governor sununu's statement
yesterday

01:09:52.550 --> 01:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
01:09:54.709 --> 01:09:54.719 align:start position:0%
regarding congressional redistricting
 
01:09:57.669 --> 01:09:57.679 align:start position:0%
maps has prompted me to add to my
 
01:10:00.470 --> 01:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
prepared testimony
 
01:10:03.510 --> 01:10:03.520 align:start position:0%
prior to the past years grass i'm sorry
 
01:10:05.669 --> 01:10:05.679 align:start position:0%
prior to the past year grassroots
 
01:10:05.679 --> 01:10:07.510 align:start position:0%
prior to the past year grassroots
citizens

01:10:07.510 --> 01:10:07.520 align:start position:0%
citizens
 
01:10:09.590 --> 01:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
like myself worked here at the state
 
01:10:12.790 --> 01:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
house to pass two separate bills for a
 
01:10:15.910 --> 01:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
non-partisan redistricting commission to
 
01:10:18.229 --> 01:10:18.239 align:start position:0%
prevent gerrymandering
 
01:10:21.110 --> 01:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
we were told by state legislators then
 
01:10:22.950 --> 01:10:22.960 align:start position:0%
that they would not support such a
 
01:10:25.030 --> 01:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
commission because the commission would
 
01:10:28.310 --> 01:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
not be responsible to the people
 
01:10:30.470 --> 01:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
and only the state legislators had the
 
01:10:32.870 --> 01:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
right to re redraw
 
01:10:35.110 --> 01:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
redistricting maps
 
01:10:38.310 --> 01:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
so we compromised
 
01:10:40.229 --> 01:10:40.239 align:start position:0%
and the bills were finally passed in the
 
01:10:42.470 --> 01:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
name of the people
 
01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:43.590 align:start position:0%
name of the people
twice

01:10:43.590 --> 01:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
twice
 
01:10:46.149 --> 01:10:46.159 align:start position:0%
the governor vetoed the bills saying
 
01:10:48.390 --> 01:10:48.400 align:start position:0%
that we don't have gerrymandering in new
 
01:10:51.110 --> 01:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire so we don't need nonpartisan
 
01:10:53.590 --> 01:10:53.600 align:start position:0%
redistricting commissions
 
01:10:56.310 --> 01:10:56.320 align:start position:0%
you have proven him wrong
 
01:10:58.630 --> 01:10:58.640 align:start position:0%
no we wouldn't be here doing this over
 
01:11:03.189 --> 01:11:03.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:05.590 --> 01:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
i believe that our democracy works
 
01:11:08.310 --> 01:11:08.320 align:start position:0%
really well when legislators of all
 
01:11:11.030 --> 01:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
political parties work together in
 
01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:12.790 align:start position:0%
political parties work together in
compromise

01:11:12.790 --> 01:11:12.800 align:start position:0%
compromise
 
01:11:16.070 --> 01:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
to create laws which truly represent all
 
01:11:19.430 --> 01:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
new hampshire voters far better than any
 
01:11:22.229 --> 01:11:22.239 align:start position:0%
one party could do on its own
 
01:11:24.070 --> 01:11:24.080 align:start position:0%
far better than what the democratic
 
01:11:25.350 --> 01:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
party could do
 
01:11:27.270 --> 01:11:27.280 align:start position:0%
for them far better than what the
 
01:11:31.030 --> 01:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
republican party could do all by itself
 
01:11:36.790 --> 01:11:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:40.310 --> 01:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
i have seen i have not seen compromises
 
01:11:42.470 --> 01:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
happening with our redistricting laws
 
01:11:43.990 --> 01:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
this year
 
01:11:48.470 --> 01:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:50.790 --> 01:11:50.800 align:start position:0%
i believe that our government fails us
 
01:11:53.430 --> 01:11:53.440 align:start position:0%
when legislators from one political
 
01:11:56.790 --> 01:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
party any political party methodically
 
01:11:59.430 --> 01:11:59.440 align:start position:0%
create redistricting laws for the
 
01:12:01.830 --> 01:12:01.840 align:start position:0%
express purpose of putting their
 
01:12:04.390 --> 01:12:04.400 align:start position:0%
political party in complete charge of
 
01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:05.910 align:start position:0%
political party in complete charge of
determining

01:12:05.910 --> 01:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
determining
 
01:12:08.790 --> 01:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
what laws will be passed for the next 10
 
01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:11.270 align:start position:0%
what laws will be passed for the next 10
years

01:12:11.270 --> 01:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:12:14.630 --> 01:12:14.640 align:start position:0%
it fails us also when legislators choose
 
01:12:17.669 --> 01:12:17.679 align:start position:0%
to vote to please and protect their own
 
01:12:17.679 --> 01:12:18.709 align:start position:0%
to vote to please and protect their own
party

01:12:18.709 --> 01:12:18.719 align:start position:0%
party
 
01:12:21.350 --> 01:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
political party bosses rather than
 
01:12:24.390 --> 01:12:24.400 align:start position:0%
representing their constituents
 
01:12:26.310 --> 01:12:26.320 align:start position:0%
i would like to remind this committee
 
01:12:28.470 --> 01:12:28.480 align:start position:0%
that the new hampshire constitution of
 
01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:30.390 align:start position:0%
that the new hampshire constitution of
1784

01:12:30.390 --> 01:12:30.400 align:start position:0%
1784
 
01:12:34.550 --> 01:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:37.990 --> 01:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
all all government of right originates
 
01:12:39.910 --> 01:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
from the people
 
01:12:42.070 --> 01:12:42.080 align:start position:0%
is founded in consent
 
01:12:45.669 --> 01:12:45.679 align:start position:0%
and instituted for the general good
 
01:12:48.229 --> 01:12:48.239 align:start position:0%
furthermore article 8 clarifies
 
01:12:51.510 --> 01:12:51.520 align:start position:0%
government accountability by stating
 
01:12:55.510 --> 01:12:55.520 align:start position:0%
all power residing originally in
 
01:12:59.030 --> 01:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
being derived from the people
 
01:13:01.350 --> 01:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
all magistrates and offices of
 
01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:02.950 align:start position:0%
all magistrates and offices of
government

01:13:02.950 --> 01:13:02.960 align:start position:0%
government
 
01:13:06.310 --> 01:13:06.320 align:start position:0%
are their substitutes and agents
 
01:13:10.470 --> 01:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
and at all times accountable to them
 
01:13:13.030 --> 01:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
government therefore should be open
 
01:13:16.870 --> 01:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
accessible accountable and responsive
 
01:13:19.510 --> 01:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
we the people your constituents have
 
01:13:23.030 --> 01:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
been consistently asking for competitive
 
01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:24.070 align:start position:0%
been consistently asking for competitive
maps

01:13:24.070 --> 01:13:24.080 align:start position:0%
maps
 
01:13:26.870 --> 01:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
based around communities of interest
 
01:13:31.030 --> 01:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
i ask you again today will you make this
 
01:13:33.350 --> 01:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
map competitive
 
01:13:34.390 --> 01:13:34.400 align:start position:0%
while the
 
01:13:39.110 --> 01:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:41.270 --> 01:13:41.280 align:start position:0%
in the map in front of you are a bit
 
01:13:43.350 --> 01:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
more competitive than the districts
 
01:13:45.830 --> 01:13:45.840 align:start position:0%
awaiting the governor's veto they are
 
01:13:48.790 --> 01:13:48.800 align:start position:0%
still not as competitive as the maps we
 
01:13:51.669 --> 01:13:51.679 align:start position:0%
already had in 2010
 
01:13:54.310 --> 01:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
the population between the two districts
 
01:13:56.790 --> 01:13:56.800 align:start position:0%
could easily be evened out by simply
 
01:13:59.669 --> 01:13:59.679 align:start position:0%
swapping two towns
 
01:14:03.750 --> 01:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
and epson i'm sorry an epsom
 
01:14:06.070 --> 01:14:06.080 align:start position:0%
i remember the chair of this committee
 
01:14:08.950 --> 01:14:08.960 align:start position:0%
assuring the public at her first meeting
 
01:14:11.830 --> 01:14:11.840 align:start position:0%
that the maps created by this committee
 
01:14:13.669 --> 01:14:13.679 align:start position:0%
would be fair
 
01:14:17.350 --> 01:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
transparent and would not benefit any
 
01:14:19.910 --> 01:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
one political party
 
01:14:22.310 --> 01:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
since that time i have attended and
 
01:14:25.270 --> 01:14:25.280 align:start position:0%
given testimony at countless meetings on
 
01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:30.630 align:start position:0%
given testimony at countless meetings on
redistricting

01:14:30.630 --> 01:14:30.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:33.750 --> 01:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
at each of these public hearings
 
01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:35.110 align:start position:0%
at each of these public hearings
sorry

01:14:35.110 --> 01:14:35.120 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
01:14:37.510 --> 01:14:37.520 align:start position:0%
at each of these public hearings large
 
01:14:40.149 --> 01:14:40.159 align:start position:0%
numbers of voters showed up
 
01:14:41.990 --> 01:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
with an overwhelming call for
 
01:14:45.350 --> 01:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
redistricting maps that represent all
 
01:14:47.990 --> 01:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
voters of new hampshire and which do not
 
01:14:50.630 --> 01:14:50.640 align:start position:0%
give unfair advantage to one political
 
01:14:53.030 --> 01:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
party over another
 
01:14:55.590 --> 01:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
in reply you have presented us with one
 
01:14:58.229 --> 01:14:58.239 align:start position:0%
map after another which gives unfair
 
01:15:01.189 --> 01:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
advantage to one political party i am
 
01:15:04.470 --> 01:15:04.480 align:start position:0%
incredibly disappointed and angry that
 
01:15:06.870 --> 01:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
our public requests
 
01:15:09.750 --> 01:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
for redistricting maps this year have
 
01:15:12.950 --> 01:15:12.960 align:start position:0%
been consistently ignored
 
01:15:15.110 --> 01:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
i ask you again
 
01:15:22.149 --> 01:15:22.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:31.110 --> 01:15:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:33.669 --> 01:15:33.679 align:start position:0%
next liz tentarelli
 
01:15:36.149 --> 01:15:36.159 align:start position:0%
neither in support nor opposition to the
 
01:15:47.669 --> 01:15:47.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:49.750 --> 01:15:49.760 align:start position:0%
thank you i think i wrote on the top of
 
01:15:52.709 --> 01:15:52.719 align:start position:0%
this i'm ambivalent
 
01:15:55.590 --> 01:15:55.600 align:start position:0%
i'm liz tentarelli i live in newbury i'm
 
01:15:58.790 --> 01:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
president of the league of women voters
 
01:16:01.430 --> 01:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
and i'm not ambivalent about demanding
 
01:16:04.390 --> 01:16:04.400 align:start position:0%
fair maps so i will say that this
 
01:16:08.390 --> 01:16:08.400 align:start position:0%
proposed map is a definite improvement
 
01:16:10.310 --> 01:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
over the one that has passed through the
 
01:16:12.709 --> 01:16:12.719 align:start position:0%
legislature because the districts are
 
01:16:14.950 --> 01:16:14.960 align:start position:0%
more competitive
 
01:16:16.630 --> 01:16:16.640 align:start position:0%
and i think that's a good thing and
 
01:16:19.510 --> 01:16:19.520 align:start position:0%
that's what voters want
 
01:16:22.709 --> 01:16:22.719 align:start position:0%
um but i'm not sure i can say
 
01:16:25.590 --> 01:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
the rest of my testimony because
 
01:16:27.669 --> 01:16:27.679 align:start position:0%
representative griffin
 
01:16:29.990 --> 01:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
took my thunder when she said
 
01:16:32.070 --> 01:16:32.080 align:start position:0%
i think we can do better
 
01:16:34.470 --> 01:16:34.480 align:start position:0%
because as i was thinking about this in
 
01:16:36.870 --> 01:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
the way down in the car i said
 
01:16:39.030 --> 01:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
maybe i'll just try a one-sentence
 
01:16:40.870 --> 01:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
testimony and say
 
01:16:43.669 --> 01:16:43.679 align:start position:0%
you can do better
 
01:16:46.149 --> 01:16:46.159 align:start position:0%
but it makes more more sense coming from
 
01:16:48.630 --> 01:16:48.640 align:start position:0%
representative griffin
 
01:16:51.590 --> 01:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
so i i hope you will do better
 
01:16:53.910 --> 01:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
on a personal note i can't speak for
 
01:16:56.630 --> 01:16:56.640 align:start position:0%
league here i have always thought that
 
01:16:59.430 --> 01:16:59.440 align:start position:0%
the representatives to congress from our
 
01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:00.470 align:start position:0%
the representatives to congress from our
state

01:17:00.470 --> 01:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:17:03.110 --> 01:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
should understand the whole state
 
01:17:05.590 --> 01:17:05.600 align:start position:0%
they should understand the economies of
 
01:17:07.030 --> 01:17:07.040 align:start position:0%
the cities
 
01:17:10.470 --> 01:17:10.480 align:start position:0%
the needs of the suburban areas and
 
01:17:13.590 --> 01:17:13.600 align:start position:0%
understand the rural needs
 
01:17:16.630 --> 01:17:16.640 align:start position:0%
and the 2011 map
 
01:17:21.910 --> 01:17:21.920 align:start position:0%
did include rural areas in district 1.
 
01:17:24.390 --> 01:17:24.400 align:start position:0%
i thought that was important because
 
01:17:26.870 --> 01:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
included there that meant that whoever
 
01:17:29.669 --> 01:17:29.679 align:start position:0%
gets elected from that district needs to
 
01:17:33.350 --> 01:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
be responsive to those constituents
 
01:17:36.070 --> 01:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
and i don't know if it's still possible
 
01:17:39.350 --> 01:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
to draw a map like that
 
01:17:41.590 --> 01:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
where you do include some of those rural
 
01:17:43.910 --> 01:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
areas but i think it makes a difference
 
01:17:45.830 --> 01:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
i wish that
 
01:17:47.830 --> 01:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
all congressional
 
01:17:49.750 --> 01:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
representatives from all over the
 
01:17:52.229 --> 01:17:52.239 align:start position:0%
country could represent that diversity i
 
01:17:54.310 --> 01:17:54.320 align:start position:0%
realize they can't we've got huge cities
 
01:17:57.350 --> 01:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
that have multiple reps
 
01:17:59.030 --> 01:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
but i think here in new hampshire we
 
01:18:01.669 --> 01:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
could do that i know you have had other
 
01:18:04.310 --> 01:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
drafts you've had a mapathon proposal
 
01:18:07.110 --> 01:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
you've had a minority proposal
 
01:18:10.709 --> 01:18:10.719 align:start position:0%
and uh as representative griffin said i
 
01:18:13.669 --> 01:18:13.679 align:start position:0%
too think that you can do better and i
 
01:18:16.950 --> 01:18:16.960 align:start position:0%
hope you do so thank you
 
01:18:20.229 --> 01:18:20.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:21.430 --> 01:18:21.440 align:start position:0%
oh did you
 
01:18:24.830 --> 01:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:24.840 --> 01:18:26.390 align:start position:0%
 
sure

01:18:26.390 --> 01:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:18:28.709 --> 01:18:28.719 align:start position:0%
representative barry thank you um a
 
01:18:30.870 --> 01:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
quick question can you please define
 
01:18:32.790 --> 01:18:32.800 align:start position:0%
what what your definition of competitive
 
01:18:35.910 --> 01:18:35.920 align:start position:0%
is because one party has won 90 of the
 
01:18:38.070 --> 01:18:38.080 align:start position:0%
contests in the last 10 years so
 
01:18:40.550 --> 01:18:40.560 align:start position:0%
what is your metric for for competitive
 
01:18:42.870 --> 01:18:42.880 align:start position:0%
because for me it's it's outcome what is
 
01:18:45.430 --> 01:18:45.440 align:start position:0%
your definition i i am surprised that
 
01:18:47.430 --> 01:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
that has happened frankly because i
 
01:18:49.430 --> 01:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
don't think that the way the towns are
 
01:18:49.440 --> 01:18:51.070 align:start position:0%
don't think that the way the towns are
arranged

01:18:51.070 --> 01:18:51.080 align:start position:0%
arranged
 
01:18:55.270 --> 01:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
predetermined that district 2 would be
 
01:18:57.750 --> 01:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
so cons and and has it been 10 years i
 
01:19:00.550 --> 01:19:00.560 align:start position:0%
thought it was eight years but anyway
 
01:19:03.830 --> 01:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for that correction um so
 
01:19:07.030 --> 01:19:07.040 align:start position:0%
my definition of competitive is that
 
01:19:09.750 --> 01:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
a good candidate from either party has a
 
01:19:12.870 --> 01:19:12.880 align:start position:0%
reasonable chance of making progress in
 
01:19:14.390 --> 01:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
the district
 
01:19:16.229 --> 01:19:16.239 align:start position:0%
and we certainly have seen that in
 
01:19:18.310 --> 01:19:18.320 align:start position:0%
district one
 
01:19:20.709 --> 01:19:20.719 align:start position:0%
over the last 10 years it has flipped
 
01:19:23.270 --> 01:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
back and forth several times
 
01:19:27.030 --> 01:19:27.040 align:start position:0%
district one has changed
 
01:19:31.270 --> 01:19:31.280 align:start position:0%
one time one flip okay my my memory is
 
01:19:34.470 --> 01:19:34.480 align:start position:0%
longer i guess than 10 years and i'm
 
01:19:37.110 --> 01:19:37.120 align:start position:0%
perceiving flips that that you are not
 
01:19:40.470 --> 01:19:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:42.630 --> 01:19:42.640 align:start position:0%
okay follow up um so this one this one's
 
01:19:44.870 --> 01:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
actually more intellectual um
 
01:19:46.950 --> 01:19:46.960 align:start position:0%
this one so you said in your testimony
 
01:19:48.390 --> 01:19:48.400 align:start position:0%
you thought
 
01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:49.350 align:start position:0%
you thought
uh

01:19:49.350 --> 01:19:49.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:19:52.229 --> 01:19:52.239 align:start position:0%
the best map would be one that had urban
 
01:19:54.950 --> 01:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
suburban and rural and you the league of
 
01:19:57.590 --> 01:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
women voters is a part of the mapathon
 
01:19:57.600 --> 01:19:58.870 align:start position:0%
women voters is a part of the mapathon
coalition

01:19:58.870 --> 01:19:58.880 align:start position:0%
coalition
 
01:20:01.669 --> 01:20:01.679 align:start position:0%
the fair maps people
 
01:20:03.910 --> 01:20:03.920 align:start position:0%
who talks about all the time communities
 
01:20:06.950 --> 01:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
of interests but you just described
 
01:20:09.430 --> 01:20:09.440 align:start position:0%
splitting three communities of interest
 
01:20:12.310 --> 01:20:12.320 align:start position:0%
so i'm kind of confused is
 
01:20:13.910 --> 01:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
is how
 
01:20:15.430 --> 01:20:15.440 align:start position:0%
like i'm confused at the messaging there
 
01:20:16.709 --> 01:20:16.719 align:start position:0%
right we keep communities of interest
 
01:20:18.629 --> 01:20:18.639 align:start position:0%
together oh no we should actually do a
 
01:20:20.790 --> 01:20:20.800 align:start position:0%
suburban urban and rural district that's
 
01:20:21.990 --> 01:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
two different things in my mind can you
 
01:20:23.510 --> 01:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
explain the difference between that yes
 
01:20:25.830 --> 01:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
i probably said it wrong so thank you
 
01:20:28.870 --> 01:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
for that question so i can clarify
 
01:20:28.880 --> 01:20:30.550 align:start position:0%
for that question so i can clarify
um

01:20:30.550 --> 01:20:30.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:33.189 --> 01:20:33.199 align:start position:0%
i think that that rural needs are very
 
01:20:34.950 --> 01:20:34.960 align:start position:0%
different from urban needs from
 
01:20:37.669 --> 01:20:37.679 align:start position:0%
industrial needs i think one somebody
 
01:20:40.550 --> 01:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
earlier mentioned economic units such as
 
01:20:42.870 --> 01:20:42.880 align:start position:0%
the greater manchester area
 
01:20:45.350 --> 01:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
and that's a community of interest
 
01:20:47.350 --> 01:20:47.360 align:start position:0%
but i think by the time you get to
 
01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:48.950 align:start position:0%
but i think by the time you get to
congress

01:20:48.950 --> 01:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
congress
 
01:20:51.189 --> 01:20:51.199 align:start position:0%
the congressional rep needs to
 
01:20:54.390 --> 01:20:54.400 align:start position:0%
understand all of those communities of
 
01:20:54.400 --> 01:20:55.510 align:start position:0%
understand all of those communities of
interest

01:20:55.510 --> 01:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
interest
 
01:20:57.669 --> 01:20:57.679 align:start position:0%
and ideally
 
01:21:01.270 --> 01:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
in my humble opinion a congressional
 
01:21:02.629 --> 01:21:02.639 align:start position:0%
district would
 
01:21:05.910 --> 01:21:05.920 align:start position:0%
include whatever there is in the state
 
01:21:09.030 --> 01:21:09.040 align:start position:0%
and have samples of all of those
 
01:21:11.189 --> 01:21:11.199 align:start position:0%
so that's what i was trying to say
 
01:21:13.830 --> 01:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
representative barry and i may not be
 
01:21:19.270 --> 01:21:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:22.790 --> 01:21:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:28.550 --> 01:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:28.560 --> 01:21:29.350 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:21:29.350 --> 01:21:29.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:21:32.149 --> 01:21:32.159 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
01:21:33.990 --> 01:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
how do you feel that there's not going
 
01:21:36.709 --> 01:21:36.719 align:start position:0%
to be any public hearings on any further
 
01:21:38.709 --> 01:21:38.719 align:start position:0%
proposed maps
 
01:21:40.709 --> 01:21:40.719 align:start position:0%
that's something we've been fighting for
 
01:21:43.110 --> 01:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
since uh 2011
 
01:21:45.510 --> 01:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
that we need public hearings
 
01:21:47.990 --> 01:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy that we're having this one
 
01:21:50.310 --> 01:21:50.320 align:start position:0%
i think if there are other amendments
 
01:21:52.149 --> 01:21:52.159 align:start position:0%
and other proposals there should be
 
01:21:54.070 --> 01:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
public hearings
 
01:21:56.870 --> 01:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
we don't want a repetition
 
01:21:59.430 --> 01:21:59.440 align:start position:0%
of what happened in 2011 that left
 
01:21:59.440 --> 01:22:00.629 align:start position:0%
of what happened in 2011 that left
voters

01:22:00.629 --> 01:22:00.639 align:start position:0%
voters
 
01:22:02.709 --> 01:22:02.719 align:start position:0%
and even legislators completely
 
01:22:05.830 --> 01:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
frustrated so any further maps should
 
01:22:08.950 --> 01:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
have public hearings in my opinion
 
01:22:12.550 --> 01:22:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:14.070 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:22:14.070 --> 01:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:22:15.590 --> 01:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
01:22:17.350 --> 01:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
taking my question so when you're
 
01:22:19.510 --> 01:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
talking about splitting or communities
 
01:22:21.350 --> 01:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
of interest how do you feel when we're
 
01:22:23.270 --> 01:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
splitting the northern part of carroll
 
01:22:24.870 --> 01:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
county and this amendment and giving
 
01:22:27.510 --> 01:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
that over to cd2 and
 
01:22:27.520 --> 01:22:29.669 align:start position:0%
that over to cd2 and
yeah

01:22:29.669 --> 01:22:29.679 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:22:31.669 --> 01:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
so i don't i don't have the county maps
 
01:22:33.910 --> 01:22:33.920 align:start position:0%
on my drawing i did try to draw it at
 
01:22:35.270 --> 01:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
home but
 
01:22:37.189 --> 01:22:37.199 align:start position:0%
but many parts of carroll county are
 
01:22:39.590 --> 01:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
more like coast county aren't they in
 
01:22:41.430 --> 01:22:41.440 align:start position:0%
their needs
 
01:22:43.030 --> 01:22:43.040 align:start position:0%
in their issues
 
01:22:45.590 --> 01:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
and so when those parts of carroll
 
01:22:48.470 --> 01:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
county were included in district one
 
01:22:50.149 --> 01:22:50.159 align:start position:0%
i think whoever was elected from
 
01:22:52.470 --> 01:22:52.480 align:start position:0%
district one needed to take that into
 
01:22:52.480 --> 01:22:53.910 align:start position:0%
district one needed to take that into
account

01:22:53.910 --> 01:22:53.920 align:start position:0%
account
 
01:22:56.390 --> 01:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
in terms of votes in congress
 
01:22:58.870 --> 01:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
so that's why i
 
01:23:01.750 --> 01:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
would like something maybe closer to
 
01:23:03.910 --> 01:23:03.920 align:start position:0%
the current maps
 
01:23:03.920 --> 01:23:04.870 align:start position:0%
the current maps
which

01:23:04.870 --> 01:23:04.880 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:23:06.629 --> 01:23:06.639 align:start position:0%
maybe could be made more competitive
 
01:23:09.030 --> 01:23:09.040 align:start position:0%
somehow i'm not sure
 
01:23:13.590 --> 01:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:15.910 --> 01:23:15.920 align:start position:0%
current maps meaning the 2011 maps i
 
01:23:18.390 --> 01:23:18.400 align:start position:0%
don't think they're terrible
 
01:23:20.950 --> 01:23:20.960 align:start position:0%
they are somewhat competitive and i'd
 
01:23:23.270 --> 01:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
like to see them more competitive if
 
01:23:25.110 --> 01:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
representative barry could move some
 
01:23:27.350 --> 01:23:27.360 align:start position:0%
towns around make them so
 
01:23:30.709 --> 01:23:30.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:33.030 --> 01:23:33.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for this opportunity
 
01:23:41.110 --> 01:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:44.149 --> 01:23:44.159 align:start position:0%
next neither in support or opposition
 
01:24:13.510 --> 01:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:15.030 --> 01:24:15.040 align:start position:0%
good morning members of the special
 
01:24:16.310 --> 01:24:16.320 align:start position:0%
committee on redistricting for the
 
01:24:17.910 --> 01:24:17.920 align:start position:0%
record my name is olivia zing the
 
01:24:20.470 --> 01:24:20.480 align:start position:0%
executive director of open democracy
 
01:24:22.870 --> 01:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
action a non-partisan nonprofit pro
 
01:24:24.950 --> 01:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
voter organization and i live in
 
01:24:24.960 --> 01:24:26.229 align:start position:0%
voter organization and i live in
franklin

01:24:26.229 --> 01:24:26.239 align:start position:0%
franklin
 
01:24:29.350 --> 01:24:29.360 align:start position:0%
um i'm here today to ask for senate bill
 
01:24:32.310 --> 01:24:32.320 align:start position:0%
200 as amended to be amended again to
 
01:24:34.790 --> 01:24:34.800 align:start position:0%
equalize population
 
01:24:36.550 --> 01:24:36.560 align:start position:0%
i want to really briefly talk about
 
01:24:39.270 --> 01:24:39.280 align:start position:0%
population equalization standard or one
 
01:24:41.750 --> 01:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
person one vote the supreme court
 
01:24:45.270 --> 01:24:45.280 align:start position:0%
interpreted our u.s constitution
 
01:24:49.030 --> 01:24:49.040 align:start position:0%
in a 1964 ruling westberry versus
 
01:24:54.310 --> 01:24:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:56.310 --> 01:24:56.320 align:start position:0%
really interpreting article one section
 
01:24:58.629 --> 01:24:58.639 align:start position:0%
two of the new hampshire constitution
 
01:25:01.189 --> 01:25:01.199 align:start position:0%
really around equalization standard or
 
01:25:03.350 --> 01:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
one pers the principle of one person one
 
01:25:04.950 --> 01:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
vote and i think
 
01:25:07.270 --> 01:25:07.280 align:start position:0%
it it does this committee
 
01:25:09.590 --> 01:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
should work towards trying to get
 
01:25:12.790 --> 01:25:12.800 align:start position:0%
districts with equal population
 
01:25:14.550 --> 01:25:14.560 align:start position:0%
i want to also talk about a new jersey
 
01:25:15.750 --> 01:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
court case
 
01:25:18.229 --> 01:25:18.239 align:start position:0%
that rejected a point
 
01:25:18.239 --> 01:25:19.350 align:start position:0%
that rejected a point
six

01:25:19.350 --> 01:25:19.360 align:start position:0%
six
 
01:25:23.030 --> 01:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
nine eight four deviation
 
01:25:26.070 --> 01:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
on the population equalization standard
 
01:25:29.270 --> 01:25:29.280 align:start position:0%
and then another west virginia case
 
01:25:30.870 --> 01:25:30.880 align:start position:0%
around population
 
01:25:32.709 --> 01:25:32.719 align:start position:0%
deviation i think it's important for us
 
01:25:35.110 --> 01:25:35.120 align:start position:0%
to understand that
 
01:25:37.270 --> 01:25:37.280 align:start position:0%
my understanding of this map
 
01:25:39.030 --> 01:25:39.040 align:start position:0%
and there was two different maps passed
 
01:25:40.870 --> 01:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
around one had brookline in it and one
 
01:25:43.430 --> 01:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
had when one didn't but the amendment
 
01:25:43.440 --> 01:25:44.310 align:start position:0%
had when one didn't but the amendment
text

01:25:44.310 --> 01:25:44.320 align:start position:0%
text
 
01:25:47.189 --> 01:25:47.199 align:start position:0%
does have brook hold on brookfield
 
01:25:49.750 --> 01:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
brookfield in it um so i have it as a
 
01:25:51.790 --> 01:25:51.800 align:start position:0%
plus a hundred and uh
 
01:25:55.629 --> 01:25:55.639 align:start position:0%
715 people and a negative
 
01:25:57.510 --> 01:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
716 people
 
01:26:01.229 --> 01:26:01.239 align:start position:0%
giving it a total population change of
 
01:26:07.830 --> 01:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
1431 people and a deviation of 0.021
 
01:26:11.189 --> 01:26:11.199 align:start position:0%
this is a population deviation that does
 
01:26:13.750 --> 01:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
is in the threshold of the court
 
01:26:15.430 --> 01:26:15.440 align:start position:0%
but we could do better
 
01:26:17.510 --> 01:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
one way to do better on this proposed
 
01:26:19.990 --> 01:26:20.000 align:start position:0%
amendment is taking the town of loudon
 
01:26:22.550 --> 01:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
and switching it for epsom if you switch
 
01:26:24.870 --> 01:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
that you get a population
 
01:26:29.189 --> 01:26:29.199 align:start position:0%
plus 26 people and negative 27 people
 
01:26:32.229 --> 01:26:32.239 align:start position:0%
for a total of 53 people changed with a
 
01:26:33.990 --> 01:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
deviation of
 
01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.790 align:start position:0%
deviation of
0.01

01:26:36.790 --> 01:26:36.800 align:start position:0%
0.01
 
01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:37.990 align:start position:0%
0.01
population

01:26:37.990 --> 01:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
population
 
01:26:40.390 --> 01:26:40.400 align:start position:0%
this makes adjustments for more equal
 
01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:42.950 align:start position:0%
this makes adjustments for more equal
representation

01:26:42.950 --> 01:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
representation
 
01:26:44.870 --> 01:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
senate bill 200
 
01:26:47.430 --> 01:26:47.440 align:start position:0%
100 as amended is more competitive than
 
01:26:49.510 --> 01:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
the previous proposal but less
 
01:26:52.229 --> 01:26:52.239 align:start position:0%
competitive than the current map
 
01:26:54.470 --> 01:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
redistricting impacts our daily lives
 
01:26:56.310 --> 01:26:56.320 align:start position:0%
and drawing these lines
 
01:26:59.030 --> 01:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
is really important around how
 
01:27:01.030 --> 01:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
resources are allocated to new hampshire
 
01:27:03.750 --> 01:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
for hospitals schools roads
 
01:27:05.750 --> 01:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
and they're very critical
 
01:27:06.790 --> 01:27:06.800 align:start position:0%
to answer
 
01:27:09.669 --> 01:27:09.679 align:start position:0%
representative weber's question this map
 
01:27:13.270 --> 01:27:13.280 align:start position:0%
shifts 25 towns for a total population
 
01:27:17.350 --> 01:27:17.360 align:start position:0%
shifted of 152
 
01:27:17.360 --> 01:27:18.790 align:start position:0%
shifted of 152
thirty

01:27:18.790 --> 01:27:18.800 align:start position:0%
thirty
 
01:27:20.390 --> 01:27:20.400 align:start position:0%
seven people
 
01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:21.830 align:start position:0%
seven people
um

01:27:21.830 --> 01:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:23.590 --> 01:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
what this map does
 
01:27:25.590 --> 01:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
is it takes the vast majority of the
 
01:27:28.470 --> 01:27:28.480 align:start position:0%
north count country out
 
01:27:30.709 --> 01:27:30.719 align:start position:0%
and only keeping north country
 
01:27:33.430 --> 01:27:33.440 align:start position:0%
represented by one district
 
01:27:35.510 --> 01:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
and i think it's important for people
 
01:27:37.430 --> 01:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
who live in northern new hampshire to
 
01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:38.229 align:start position:0%
who live in northern new hampshire to
have

01:27:38.229 --> 01:27:38.239 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:27:41.510 --> 01:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:43.350 --> 01:27:43.360 align:start position:0%
my take of this map and just
 
01:27:45.110 --> 01:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
is that it doesn't recognize a lot of
 
01:27:48.149 --> 01:27:48.159 align:start position:0%
communities of interest
 
01:27:49.430 --> 01:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
and cohes
 
01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:51.270 align:start position:0%
and cohes
cohesiveness

01:27:51.270 --> 01:27:51.280 align:start position:0%
cohesiveness
 
01:27:54.390 --> 01:27:54.400 align:start position:0%
and if you are looking for ideas for an
 
01:27:57.030 --> 01:27:57.040 align:start position:0%
another compromise amendment you could
 
01:27:59.430 --> 01:27:59.440 align:start position:0%
put all of belknap carol stratford and
 
01:28:01.750 --> 01:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
rockingham county plus manchester and
 
01:28:04.390 --> 01:28:04.400 align:start position:0%
pelham if you put those four counties
 
01:28:06.790 --> 01:28:06.800 align:start position:0%
and those two towns together you'd have
 
01:28:08.870 --> 01:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
a plus 22
 
01:28:12.310 --> 01:28:12.320 align:start position:0%
or plus plus 21 negative 20
 
01:28:15.350 --> 01:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
to 22 for a 43 people difference and a
 
01:28:18.149 --> 01:28:18.159 align:start position:0%
zero deviation by keeping those counties
 
01:28:20.709 --> 01:28:20.719 align:start position:0%
together so if keeping counties together
 
01:28:22.629 --> 01:28:22.639 align:start position:0%
you could put four counties manchester
 
01:28:25.189 --> 01:28:25.199 align:start position:0%
and pelham in one district
 
01:28:28.310 --> 01:28:28.320 align:start position:0%
for a compromise amendment so those are
 
01:28:30.470 --> 01:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
two ideas
 
01:28:33.669 --> 01:28:33.679 align:start position:0%
and i also have testimony from
 
01:28:35.750 --> 01:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
a voter in tamworth
 
01:28:37.990 --> 01:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
to talk about who talks a little bit
 
01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.550 align:start position:0%
to talk about who talks a little bit
about

01:28:40.550 --> 01:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:42.390 --> 01:28:42.400 align:start position:0%
keeping the north country together and a
 
01:28:45.350 --> 01:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
voter in durham who was unable to attend
 
01:28:45.360 --> 01:28:46.310 align:start position:0%
voter in durham who was unable to attend
today

01:28:46.310 --> 01:28:46.320 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:28:47.510 --> 01:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
and with that i'm happy to take
 
01:28:47.520 --> 01:28:49.350 align:start position:0%
and with that i'm happy to take
questions

01:28:49.350 --> 01:28:49.360 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:28:51.590 --> 01:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
thank you actually i have one
 
01:28:53.590 --> 01:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
in the court cases that you cited with
 
01:28:55.590 --> 01:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
the deviation issues
 
01:28:57.910 --> 01:28:57.920 align:start position:0%
the cases that we've looked at
 
01:28:59.669 --> 01:28:59.679 align:start position:0%
if we just had to go to a perfect
 
01:29:02.149 --> 01:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
population as close as we could get we
 
01:29:03.350 --> 01:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
wouldn't need the committee because it
 
01:29:05.590 --> 01:29:05.600 align:start position:0%
would be a math exercise when they go to
 
01:29:07.430 --> 01:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
court they defend the population
 
01:29:09.430 --> 01:29:09.440 align:start position:0%
deviation based on the rational basis
 
01:29:10.629 --> 01:29:10.639 align:start position:0%
for the plan
 
01:29:13.030 --> 01:29:13.040 align:start position:0%
was that what made those
 
01:29:15.590 --> 01:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
cases fail or actually i guess i should
 
01:29:17.270 --> 01:29:17.280 align:start position:0%
ask did they fail
 
01:29:19.590 --> 01:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
going into court you justify a rational
 
01:29:21.270 --> 01:29:21.280 align:start position:0%
basis so what happened
 
01:29:23.189 --> 01:29:23.199 align:start position:0%
the new jersey court did reject the
 
01:29:25.430 --> 01:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
population deviation although the west
 
01:29:30.229 --> 01:29:30.239 align:start position:0%
virginia case accepted a 0.79
 
01:29:32.790 --> 01:29:32.800 align:start position:0%
maximum population deviation but you're
 
01:29:34.709 --> 01:29:34.719 align:start position:0%
right redistricting
 
01:29:36.390 --> 01:29:36.400 align:start position:0%
there's lots of factors that go into
 
01:29:38.390 --> 01:29:38.400 align:start position:0%
redistricting and i think the reason i
 
01:29:41.110 --> 01:29:41.120 align:start position:0%
didn't check a support or a pose is i
 
01:29:43.110 --> 01:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
really hope that the legislative process
 
01:29:45.030 --> 01:29:45.040 align:start position:0%
can draw this map and it's not done by
 
01:29:46.390 --> 01:29:46.400 align:start position:0%
the courts
 
01:29:48.550 --> 01:29:48.560 align:start position:0%
it might end up being done by the courts
 
01:29:50.070 --> 01:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
the court has already there's already
 
01:29:52.870 --> 01:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
been a court case filed on this map and
 
01:29:54.950 --> 01:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
they cited one of the ways that the
 
01:29:56.550 --> 01:29:56.560 align:start position:0%
court's going to look at it is in the
 
01:29:58.950 --> 01:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
least changed approach
 
01:30:00.790 --> 01:30:00.800 align:start position:0%
and so when we look you know i don't
 
01:30:02.550 --> 01:30:02.560 align:start position:0%
know how the court will define that
 
01:30:05.830 --> 01:30:05.840 align:start position:0%
criteria but i think it's important
 
01:30:07.510 --> 01:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
for the public to have confidence in the
 
01:30:09.990 --> 01:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
map and know what the definitions of of
 
01:30:12.070 --> 01:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
all of these are
 
01:30:13.350 --> 01:30:13.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:30:17.750 --> 01:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:20.390 --> 01:30:20.400 align:start position:0%
thank you and welcome back uh i just
 
01:30:21.470 --> 01:30:21.480 align:start position:0%
wanted for
 
01:30:24.229 --> 01:30:24.239 align:start position:0%
clarification um
 
01:30:28.070 --> 01:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
in the paragraph where you talk about
 
01:30:30.229 --> 01:30:30.239 align:start position:0%
uh switching the towns of loudoun and
 
01:30:31.350 --> 01:30:31.360 align:start position:0%
the towns of
 
01:30:32.790 --> 01:30:32.800 align:start position:0%
and epsom
 
01:30:34.709 --> 01:30:34.719 align:start position:0%
is that switching them for the current
 
01:30:36.149 --> 01:30:36.159 align:start position:0%
map or switching them from the
 
01:30:38.229 --> 01:30:38.239 align:start position:0%
governor's map
 
01:30:40.070 --> 01:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
from this amendment
 
01:30:41.750 --> 01:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
um if you look at
 
01:30:44.550 --> 01:30:44.560 align:start position:0%
um sorry amendments
 
01:30:46.790 --> 01:30:46.800 align:start position:0%
um so you're talking about the amendment
 
01:30:50.070 --> 01:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
that we're considering right now 1523
 
01:30:50.080 --> 01:30:50.870 align:start position:0%
that we're considering right now 1523
and

01:30:50.870 --> 01:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:30:55.270 --> 01:30:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:57.510 --> 01:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
the first district and i if you moved
 
01:30:59.990 --> 01:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
loud into the second district swapping
 
01:31:02.470 --> 01:31:02.480 align:start position:0%
that for epsom you get a much better
 
01:31:04.550 --> 01:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
population deviation and i don't think
 
01:31:07.590 --> 01:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
it changes any of the partisanship
 
01:31:09.830 --> 01:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
those towns are very comparable in
 
01:31:11.910 --> 01:31:11.920 align:start position:0%
merrimack county thank you very much
 
01:31:14.790 --> 01:31:14.800 align:start position:0%
appreciate the clarification
 
01:31:17.669 --> 01:31:17.679 align:start position:0%
representative barry um yes thank you um
 
01:31:19.270 --> 01:31:19.280 align:start position:0%
i want to discuss uh the issue of
 
01:31:22.629 --> 01:31:22.639 align:start position:0%
competitiveness so you said that
 
01:31:24.790 --> 01:31:24.800 align:start position:0%
this proposed map
 
01:31:27.189 --> 01:31:27.199 align:start position:0%
is less competitive the governor's map
 
01:31:28.870 --> 01:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
is less competitive than the existing
 
01:31:28.880 --> 01:31:29.910 align:start position:0%
is less competitive than the existing
map

01:31:29.910 --> 01:31:29.920 align:start position:0%
map
 
01:31:32.070 --> 01:31:32.080 align:start position:0%
i took issue that with miss tantarelli
 
01:31:33.110 --> 01:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
from the league women voters i'm going
 
01:31:35.430 --> 01:31:35.440 align:start position:0%
to take issue with that with you
 
01:31:38.149 --> 01:31:38.159 align:start position:0%
one party has won 90 of the contests in
 
01:31:39.830 --> 01:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
the last decade
 
01:31:42.629 --> 01:31:42.639 align:start position:0%
you're saying that this map is going to
 
01:31:44.950 --> 01:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
be less competitive than that so is it
 
01:31:46.950 --> 01:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
going to go to zero one parties that's
 
01:31:48.070 --> 01:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
gonna win everything what's the
 
01:31:49.830 --> 01:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
definition of competitive here because
 
01:31:52.950 --> 01:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
for me once again it's outcome
 
01:31:55.830 --> 01:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
i i was using the 2020 election and i
 
01:31:57.350 --> 01:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
was actually using the presidential
 
01:31:58.950 --> 01:31:58.960 align:start position:0%
elections which is
 
01:32:01.590 --> 01:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
you can you can judge competitiveness on
 
01:32:03.430 --> 01:32:03.440 align:start position:0%
other on things i was looking at
 
01:32:05.910 --> 01:32:05.920 align:start position:0%
actually who won the presidential race
 
01:32:10.709 --> 01:32:10.719 align:start position:0%
in 2020 based on pure voter numbers um
 
01:32:13.669 --> 01:32:13.679 align:start position:0%
and the house bill 52
 
01:32:17.430 --> 01:32:17.440 align:start position:0%
um had about a ten percent
 
01:32:18.360 --> 01:32:18.370 align:start position:0%
uh partisan
 
01:32:18.370 --> 01:32:20.390 align:start position:0%
uh partisan
[Music]

01:32:20.390 --> 01:32:20.400 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:32:20.400 --> 01:32:21.430 align:start position:0%
[Music]
uh

01:32:21.430 --> 01:32:21.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:32:24.709 --> 01:32:24.719 align:start position:0%
favors favoritism using the 2020
 
01:32:28.070 --> 01:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
election results whereas this map had a
 
01:32:28.080 --> 01:32:29.350 align:start position:0%
election results whereas this map had a
plus

01:32:29.350 --> 01:32:29.360 align:start position:0%
plus
 
01:32:30.870 --> 01:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
three or four
 
01:32:33.189 --> 01:32:33.199 align:start position:0%
um and i can pull those numbers and
 
01:32:35.910 --> 01:32:35.920 align:start position:0%
email them to you and you and you can
 
01:32:38.550 --> 01:32:38.560 align:start position:0%
you can look at the competitiveness
 
01:32:40.390 --> 01:32:40.400 align:start position:0%
using different election results and i
 
01:32:42.790 --> 01:32:42.800 align:start position:0%
think new hampshire is a purple state
 
01:32:42.800 --> 01:32:44.390 align:start position:0%
think new hampshire is a purple state
where

01:32:44.390 --> 01:32:44.400 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:32:46.390 --> 01:32:46.400 align:start position:0%
different election results can give you
 
01:32:48.629 --> 01:32:48.639 align:start position:0%
different measures of competitiveness
 
01:32:51.350 --> 01:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
but i was using the 2020 election
 
01:32:53.510 --> 01:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
numbers which i know is a higher
 
01:32:55.590 --> 01:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
percent turnout than we've had in
 
01:32:57.910 --> 01:32:57.920 align:start position:0%
previous elections follow
 
01:33:01.270 --> 01:33:01.280 align:start position:0%
follow up um i i think this may uh uh
 
01:33:03.110 --> 01:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
keep keep grounded to your chair here we
 
01:33:05.270 --> 01:33:05.280 align:start position:0%
may agree on more than you believe
 
01:33:07.270 --> 01:33:07.280 align:start position:0%
um so i'm if it's okay if the chairman
 
01:33:09.430 --> 01:33:09.440 align:start position:0%
will indulge me i'm going to do a series
 
01:33:12.390 --> 01:33:12.400 align:start position:0%
of do we agree if we can't do we agree
 
01:33:12.400 --> 01:33:13.110 align:start position:0%
of do we agree if we can't do we agree
that

01:33:13.110 --> 01:33:13.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:33:14.229 --> 01:33:14.239 align:start position:0%
counties should be kept together
 
01:33:15.590 --> 01:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
representative barry
 
01:33:17.830 --> 01:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
you can ask one question all right do
 
01:33:19.350 --> 01:33:19.360 align:start position:0%
you believe that counties should be kept
 
01:33:21.669 --> 01:33:21.679 align:start position:0%
together as much as possible
 
01:33:24.550 --> 01:33:24.560 align:start position:0%
i do okay man i said one more from us
 
01:33:26.709 --> 01:33:26.719 align:start position:0%
one more yeah do you believe that major
 
01:33:28.790 --> 01:33:28.800 align:start position:0%
economic communities should be kept
 
01:33:31.110 --> 01:33:31.120 align:start position:0%
together i do thank you
 
01:33:33.430 --> 01:33:33.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:33:33.440 --> 01:33:35.270 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

01:33:35.270 --> 01:33:35.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:33:37.750 --> 01:33:37.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um following my
 
01:33:39.910 --> 01:33:39.920 align:start position:0%
colleague from manchester's land of
 
01:33:41.430 --> 01:33:41.440 align:start position:0%
thinking um
 
01:33:43.669 --> 01:33:43.679 align:start position:0%
do you believe that there are you know
 
01:33:46.070 --> 01:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
that certain candidates can outperform
 
01:33:49.990 --> 01:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
maybe their district's competitiveness
 
01:33:51.750 --> 01:33:51.760 align:start position:0%
i i think new hampshire is a very purple
 
01:33:53.669 --> 01:33:53.679 align:start position:0%
state i brought a purple marker with me
 
01:33:56.070 --> 01:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
today hoping that the one line that you
 
01:33:57.350 --> 01:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
can draw
 
01:33:59.030 --> 01:33:59.040 align:start position:0%
um down the
 
01:33:59.040 --> 01:33:59.990 align:start position:0%
um down the
state

01:33:59.990 --> 01:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:34:02.790 --> 01:34:02.800 align:start position:0%
is a purple line because we we have the
 
01:34:05.030 --> 01:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
majority of voters as undeclared voters
 
01:34:06.229 --> 01:34:06.239 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
01:34:09.110 --> 01:34:09.120 align:start position:0%
candidates performances can change based
 
01:34:11.270 --> 01:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
on the candidate and and how they're
 
01:34:11.280 --> 01:34:12.470 align:start position:0%
on the candidate and and how they're
attracting

01:34:12.470 --> 01:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
attracting
 
01:34:14.629 --> 01:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
undeclared voters and every new
 
01:34:17.510 --> 01:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire election is unique in that way
 
01:34:19.270 --> 01:34:19.280 align:start position:0%
but i do think it's important that
 
01:34:21.669 --> 01:34:21.679 align:start position:0%
voters have faith that their vote
 
01:34:24.149 --> 01:34:24.159 align:start position:0%
matters and by drawing compact and
 
01:34:26.070 --> 01:34:26.080 align:start position:0%
competitive districts
 
01:34:28.310 --> 01:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
does increase voters faith that their
 
01:34:33.110 --> 01:34:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:34.470 --> 01:34:34.480 align:start position:0%
representative land
 
01:34:37.510 --> 01:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair um
 
01:34:39.510 --> 01:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
i i couldn't write it down fast enough
 
01:34:41.910 --> 01:34:41.920 align:start position:0%
so i would just ask you to clarify
 
01:34:43.830 --> 01:34:43.840 align:start position:0%
the three counties that you said could
 
01:34:45.590 --> 01:34:45.600 align:start position:0%
be kept together
 
01:34:48.870 --> 01:34:48.880 align:start position:0%
in the last sentence of my testimony um
 
01:34:52.629 --> 01:34:52.639 align:start position:0%
it's belknap carol strafford rockingham
 
01:34:54.790 --> 01:34:54.800 align:start position:0%
and then you have to take manchester and
 
01:34:56.709 --> 01:34:56.719 align:start position:0%
pelham just to make the population so
 
01:34:58.870 --> 01:34:58.880 align:start position:0%
just the two towns there in hillsborough
 
01:35:01.430 --> 01:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
county and that does is a
 
01:35:03.590 --> 01:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
is a zero deviation
 
01:35:05.750 --> 01:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
um and it change its the difference of
 
01:35:07.270 --> 01:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
43 people
 
01:35:08.149 --> 01:35:08.159 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:35:09.510 --> 01:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
so if you wanted to keep counties
 
01:35:16.790 --> 01:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:19.030 --> 01:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
thank you um comment you just made a few
 
01:35:21.430 --> 01:35:21.440 align:start position:0%
minutes ago talked about uh voter
 
01:35:26.629 --> 01:35:26.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:29.270 --> 01:35:29.280 align:start position:0%
when one party as uh representative
 
01:35:32.149 --> 01:35:32.159 align:start position:0%
barry mentioned before wins 90
 
01:35:34.950 --> 01:35:34.960 align:start position:0%
of the elections over the last decade
 
01:35:36.070 --> 01:35:36.080 align:start position:0%
would you say that the vote of
 
01:35:38.870 --> 01:35:38.880 align:start position:0%
confidence and in those districts uh for
 
01:35:40.870 --> 01:35:40.880 align:start position:0%
one party who was not on the winning
 
01:35:44.709 --> 01:35:44.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:44.719 --> 01:35:48.229 align:start position:0%
 
compromised

01:35:48.229 --> 01:35:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:49.750 --> 01:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
um i think that
 
01:35:52.390 --> 01:35:52.400 align:start position:0%
as we had discussed earlier i think that
 
01:35:55.109 --> 01:35:55.119 align:start position:0%
candidates matter in these races and
 
01:35:57.430 --> 01:35:57.440 align:start position:0%
undeclared voters matter in these races
 
01:36:00.790 --> 01:36:00.800 align:start position:0%
and i think new hampshire is one of only
 
01:36:03.270 --> 01:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
a handful of states i think there's 18
 
01:36:05.030 --> 01:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
considered competitive districts
 
01:36:07.030 --> 01:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
throughout the country and both of new
 
01:36:08.390 --> 01:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire districts are actually
 
01:36:08.400 --> 01:36:10.229 align:start position:0%
hampshire districts are actually
considered

01:36:10.229 --> 01:36:10.239 align:start position:0%
considered
 
01:36:12.070 --> 01:36:12.080 align:start position:0%
competitive in those
 
01:36:14.310 --> 01:36:14.320 align:start position:0%
districts throughout the country so i i
 
01:36:16.950 --> 01:36:16.960 align:start position:0%
do believe that new hampshire has been i
 
01:36:18.550 --> 01:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
mean that's been a
 
01:36:23.350 --> 01:36:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:25.910 --> 01:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you mr chairman so is it
 
01:36:28.149 --> 01:36:28.159 align:start position:0%
your opinion that the current districts
 
01:36:31.030 --> 01:36:31.040 align:start position:0%
that we've um had for the last 10 years
 
01:36:32.709 --> 01:36:32.719 align:start position:0%
are competitive
 
01:36:34.870 --> 01:36:34.880 align:start position:0%
i think we've seen carol shea-porter and
 
01:36:37.189 --> 01:36:37.199 align:start position:0%
frank guinta switch back and forth
 
01:36:37.199 --> 01:36:39.990 align:start position:0%
frank guinta switch back and forth
um

01:36:39.990 --> 01:36:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:42.629 --> 01:36:42.639 align:start position:0%
i i think that you know when this
 
01:36:44.790 --> 01:36:44.800 align:start position:0%
was originally drawn
 
01:36:47.350 --> 01:36:47.360 align:start position:0%
i i think that we've you if a candidate
 
01:36:48.950 --> 01:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
from either party could win either
 
01:36:48.960 --> 01:36:53.189 align:start position:0%
from either party could win either
district

01:36:53.189 --> 01:36:53.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:55.430 --> 01:36:55.440 align:start position:0%
representative barry how many times has
 
01:36:57.510 --> 01:36:57.520 align:start position:0%
cd2 gone back and forth in the last 10
 
01:36:57.520 --> 01:37:00.070 align:start position:0%
cd2 gone back and forth in the last 10
years

01:37:00.070 --> 01:37:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:01.910 --> 01:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
i don't i mean i think congresswoman
 
01:37:03.990 --> 01:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
custer has had that
 
01:37:05.910 --> 01:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
i don't remember how many elections but
 
01:37:08.470 --> 01:37:08.480 align:start position:0%
i think prior elections it was charlie
 
01:37:08.480 --> 01:37:09.430 align:start position:0%
i think prior elections it was charlie
bass

01:37:09.430 --> 01:37:09.440 align:start position:0%
bass
 
01:37:11.030 --> 01:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
who has had that
 
01:37:14.390 --> 01:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:16.629 --> 01:37:16.639 align:start position:0%
but not in the last 10 years so in its
 
01:37:18.870 --> 01:37:18.880 align:start position:0%
current form it has never gone back and
 
01:37:21.590 --> 01:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
forth because charlie bass was
 
01:37:23.590 --> 01:37:23.600 align:start position:0%
congressman basically was elected in
 
01:37:25.910 --> 01:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
2010 on a different map
 
01:37:28.390 --> 01:37:28.400 align:start position:0%
so in the current maps configuration
 
01:37:31.350 --> 01:37:31.360 align:start position:0%
cd2 has gone back and forth how many
 
01:37:33.189 --> 01:37:33.199 align:start position:0%
times in the current configuration
 
01:37:34.950 --> 01:37:34.960 align:start position:0%
democrats have won that with paul hodes
 
01:37:39.350 --> 01:37:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:43.669 --> 01:37:43.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:45.830 --> 01:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
is your recollection the same as mine
 
01:37:48.390 --> 01:37:48.400 align:start position:0%
that there was very very little change
 
01:37:49.990 --> 01:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
in the congressional maps and the
 
01:37:51.390 --> 01:37:51.400 align:start position:0%
redistricting of
 
01:37:54.070 --> 01:37:54.080 align:start position:0%
2011 2012.
 
01:37:55.910 --> 01:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
that is my memory and actually there's
 
01:37:58.550 --> 01:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
been little change in 140 years on
 
01:38:00.229 --> 01:38:00.239 align:start position:0%
congressional districts
 
01:38:04.870 --> 01:38:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:05.910 --> 01:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:38:08.870 --> 01:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
and was is it your memories it is mine
 
01:38:11.830 --> 01:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
that the only changes were made were
 
01:38:14.629 --> 01:38:14.639 align:start position:0%
small changes along the borders to
 
01:38:17.189 --> 01:38:17.199 align:start position:0%
equalize the population changes from the
 
01:38:19.030 --> 01:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
previous ten years
 
01:38:21.189 --> 01:38:21.199 align:start position:0%
yes and i believe that's what
 
01:38:23.430 --> 01:38:23.440 align:start position:0%
uh article one section two of the new
 
01:38:25.189 --> 01:38:25.199 align:start position:0%
hampshire constitution
 
01:38:27.830 --> 01:38:27.840 align:start position:0%
asks this committee to do and can to
 
01:38:33.109 --> 01:38:33.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:35.430 --> 01:38:35.440 align:start position:0%
represent barry hogg in the action it's
 
01:38:37.350 --> 01:38:37.360 align:start position:0%
it's it's one of those days
 
01:38:37.360 --> 01:38:39.510 align:start position:0%
it's it's one of those days
um

01:38:39.510 --> 01:38:39.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:40.629 --> 01:38:40.639 align:start position:0%
you just mentioned that there's been
 
01:38:42.470 --> 01:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
very little change since the 1880 map i
 
01:38:43.350 --> 01:38:43.360 align:start position:0%
don't want to hold it up because i don't
 
01:38:46.149 --> 01:38:46.159 align:start position:0%
want to get in trouble um
 
01:38:47.109 --> 01:38:47.119 align:start position:0%
but um
 
01:38:48.470 --> 01:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
i have it in front of me chairman
 
01:38:50.229 --> 01:38:50.239 align:start position:0%
griffin distributed it
 
01:38:53.430 --> 01:38:53.440 align:start position:0%
the deviation would be 300 000 people so
 
01:38:55.830 --> 01:38:55.840 align:start position:0%
why while the towns may not be numerous
 
01:38:58.470 --> 01:38:58.480 align:start position:0%
the population is undoubtedly numerous
 
01:38:58.480 --> 01:38:59.590 align:start position:0%
the population is undoubtedly numerous
so

01:38:59.590 --> 01:38:59.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:39:01.910 --> 01:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
you're is it fair to cite that as a
 
01:39:03.430 --> 01:39:03.440 align:start position:0%
metric when we're talking about a
 
01:39:05.750 --> 01:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
population difference of 300 000 people
 
01:39:07.750 --> 01:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
if we were to have the current map as is
 
01:39:10.629 --> 01:39:10.639 align:start position:0%
apparently the gold standard
 
01:39:12.390 --> 01:39:12.400 align:start position:0%
um i think when you look at this it
 
01:39:14.550 --> 01:39:14.560 align:start position:0%
keeps those four counties together that
 
01:39:16.950 --> 01:39:16.960 align:start position:0%
i talked about that you could do um you
 
01:39:19.430 --> 01:39:19.440 align:start position:0%
would have to then if you take the
 
01:39:21.990 --> 01:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
uh 1880 map you would then need
 
01:39:24.390 --> 01:39:24.400 align:start position:0%
manchester and pelham not the other
 
01:39:26.070 --> 01:39:26.080 align:start position:0%
towns in merrimack and rockingham
 
01:39:26.080 --> 01:39:27.030 align:start position:0%
towns in merrimack and rockingham
counties

01:39:27.030 --> 01:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
counties
 
01:39:28.790 --> 01:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
but you could keep those four counties
 
01:39:31.189 --> 01:39:31.199 align:start position:0%
together like the 1880
 
01:39:32.550 --> 01:39:32.560 align:start position:0%
map but i think
 
01:39:35.350 --> 01:39:35.360 align:start position:0%
our population has shifted drastically
 
01:39:41.189 --> 01:39:41.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:43.109 --> 01:39:43.119 align:start position:0%
representative mcguire
 
01:39:45.430 --> 01:39:45.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair would you believe
 
01:39:48.310 --> 01:39:48.320 align:start position:0%
that i went back to the 2011
 
01:39:50.790 --> 01:39:50.800 align:start position:0%
committee reports and the minority was
 
01:39:52.550 --> 01:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
objecting to the congressional map on
 
01:39:54.629 --> 01:39:54.639 align:start position:0%
the because it moved too many towns from
 
01:39:56.629 --> 01:39:56.639 align:start position:0%
one district to another
 
01:40:02.629 --> 01:40:02.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:09.750 --> 01:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:12.709 --> 01:40:12.719 align:start position:0%
oh this writing's so tiny
 
01:40:15.189 --> 01:40:15.199 align:start position:0%

and
 
01:40:18.149 --> 01:40:18.159 align:start position:0%
well it says opposition and then says
 
01:40:18.159 --> 01:40:19.990 align:start position:0%
well it says opposition and then says
neutral

01:40:19.990 --> 01:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
neutral
 
01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:32.149 align:start position:0%
neutral

01:40:49.669 --> 01:40:49.679 align:start position:0%
just i didn't i don't right outside the
 
01:40:51.350 --> 01:40:51.360 align:start position:0%
lines very often so
 
01:40:53.910 --> 01:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
um i signed in remotely as neutral and
 
01:40:56.390 --> 01:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
that is how i feel
 
01:40:58.390 --> 01:40:58.400 align:start position:0%
um i believe that bringing this
 
01:41:01.189 --> 01:41:01.199 align:start position:0%
amendment forward rather than sending hb
 
01:41:05.590 --> 01:41:05.600 align:start position:0%
52 to the governor is a positive step
 
01:41:08.390 --> 01:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
these maps do improve upon those
 
01:41:10.310 --> 01:41:10.320 align:start position:0%
the seacoast towns remained in in
 
01:41:12.629 --> 01:41:12.639 align:start position:0%
district one which respects the wishes
 
01:41:14.629 --> 01:41:14.639 align:start position:0%
of the majority of the voters who live
 
01:41:14.639 --> 01:41:15.990 align:start position:0%
of the majority of the voters who live
there

01:41:15.990 --> 01:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:41:18.070 --> 01:41:18.080 align:start position:0%
these maps move less than half the
 
01:41:20.470 --> 01:41:20.480 align:start position:0%
number of people to a new district
 
01:41:22.870 --> 01:41:22.880 align:start position:0%
compared to the legislature's maps
 
01:41:25.189 --> 01:41:25.199 align:start position:0%
making them less disruptive
 
01:41:27.430 --> 01:41:27.440 align:start position:0%
the proposed maps are more competitive
 
01:41:31.350 --> 01:41:31.360 align:start position:0%
than those in hb 52 although district 1
 
01:41:34.070 --> 01:41:34.080 align:start position:0%
slightly republican and district
 
01:41:36.709 --> 01:41:36.719 align:start position:0%
excuse me two leans democratic
 
01:41:39.189 --> 01:41:39.199 align:start position:0%
the population deviation for these maps
 
01:41:41.270 --> 01:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
is greater compared to the legislative
 
01:41:41.280 --> 01:41:42.709 align:start position:0%
is greater compared to the legislative
maps

01:41:42.709 --> 01:41:42.719 align:start position:0%
maps
 
01:41:45.910 --> 01:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
and i also cited that by moving on these
 
01:41:49.189 --> 01:41:49.199 align:start position:0%
maps epsom to district 1 and loudoun to
 
01:41:51.830 --> 01:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
district 2 could improve that with a
 
01:41:57.669 --> 01:41:57.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:59.510 --> 01:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
i ask you to amend this map by
 
01:42:01.990 --> 01:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
decreasing the population deviation and
 
01:42:05.350 --> 01:42:05.360 align:start position:0%
increasing the competitiveness
 
01:42:07.430 --> 01:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
basic changes can better align these
 
01:42:09.270 --> 01:42:09.280 align:start position:0%
maps with the requests of new hampshire
 
01:42:12.149 --> 01:42:12.159 align:start position:0%
voters i do also ask though if there are
 
01:42:15.030 --> 01:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
further amendments that there be
 
01:42:17.510 --> 01:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
hearings for public comment
 
01:42:19.750 --> 01:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
and i thank you for this opportunity i
 
01:42:21.830 --> 01:42:21.840 align:start position:0%
also want to thank you for all the work
 
01:42:23.750 --> 01:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
that this committee has put in
 
01:42:26.149 --> 01:42:26.159 align:start position:0%
on redistricting
 
01:42:31.030 --> 01:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:32.709 --> 01:42:32.719 align:start position:0%
does anyone else wish to be heard on
 
01:42:36.390 --> 01:42:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:38.550 --> 01:42:38.560 align:start position:0%
seeing none we'll close a public hearing
 
01:42:50.149 --> 01:42:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:50.159 --> 01:42:58.950 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:42:58.950 --> 01:42:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:01.430 --> 01:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for conducting that hearing
 
01:43:03.669 --> 01:43:03.679 align:start position:0%
thank you to members and
 
01:43:06.229 --> 01:43:06.239 align:start position:0%
members of the public for participating
 
01:43:07.750 --> 01:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
um that
 
01:43:10.229 --> 01:43:10.239 align:start position:0%
concludes the business of this committee
 
01:43:11.990 --> 01:43:12.000 align:start position:0%

01:43:15.430 --> 01:43:15.440 align:start position:0%

up on the website i was able to get the
 
01:43:31.830 --> 01:43:31.840 align:start position:0%
what we consider today up uh you know
 
01:43:34.790 --> 01:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
last week i think cause we had it
 
01:43:37.350 --> 01:43:37.360 align:start position:0%
but to the extent anybody has any maps
 
01:43:39.189 --> 01:43:39.199 align:start position:0%
that they would like to consider at a
 
01:43:41.990 --> 01:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
ols if you can get them to me we will
 
01:43:44.149 --> 01:43:44.159 align:start position:0%
get them online we we've got a pretty
 
01:43:45.990 --> 01:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
good committee assistance
 
01:43:48.470 --> 01:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
and a researcher here who's pretty good
 
01:43:50.149 --> 01:43:50.159 align:start position:0%
about getting in touch with it as soon
 
01:43:52.149 --> 01:43:52.159 align:start position:0%
as i have something about getting it
 
01:43:54.390 --> 01:43:54.400 align:start position:0%
online and if you can if you get an
 
01:43:56.310 --> 01:43:56.320 align:start position:0%
amendment out of ols because of course
 
01:43:58.470 --> 01:43:58.480 align:start position:0%
that's how we need it is as an official
 
01:43:58.480 --> 01:43:59.590 align:start position:0%
that's how we need it is as an official
amendment

01:43:59.590 --> 01:43:59.600 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:44:02.470 --> 01:44:02.480 align:start position:0%
um if you've got a
 
01:44:04.390 --> 01:44:04.400 align:start position:0%
a picture
 
01:44:06.629 --> 01:44:06.639 align:start position:0%
as much as i'm really sort of opposed to
 
01:44:08.149 --> 01:44:08.159 align:start position:0%
the picture approach
 
01:44:11.830 --> 01:44:11.840 align:start position:0%
um let's get that also online
 
01:44:13.990 --> 01:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
um and just make sure that it matches
 
01:44:15.830 --> 01:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
whatever the ols amendment is because
 
01:44:17.669 --> 01:44:17.679 align:start position:0%
just so everybody knows for the record
 
01:44:20.790 --> 01:44:20.800 align:start position:0%
we are not getting the maps from ols
 
01:44:20.800 --> 01:44:21.510 align:start position:0%
we are not getting the maps from ols
all

01:44:21.510 --> 01:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:44:24.870 --> 01:44:24.880 align:start position:0%
ols does is draft the amendment with the
 
01:44:27.109 --> 01:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
towns and then the people who have been
 
01:44:28.790 --> 01:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
sponsoring these amendments have been
 
01:44:31.590 --> 01:44:31.600 align:start position:0%
generating the map to go with it which
 
01:44:33.270 --> 01:44:33.280 align:start position:0%
is what committee members have had in
 
01:44:34.390 --> 01:44:34.400 align:start position:0%
