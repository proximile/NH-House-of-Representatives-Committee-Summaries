um
 
00:22:57.710 --> 00:22:57.720 align:start position:0%
after talking with a lot of the
 
00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:00.120 align:start position:0%
stakeholders in this particular Bill and
 
00:23:02.529 --> 00:23:02.539 align:start position:0%
some members of the general public
 
00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:04.740 align:start position:0%
there's some information that has come
 
00:23:06.529 --> 00:23:06.539 align:start position:0%
forward that we think we could actually
 
00:23:09.370 --> 00:23:09.380 align:start position:0%
address in this bill and additionally
 
00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:11.640 align:start position:0%
some of it may be able to be made in the
 
00:23:12.890 --> 00:23:12.900 align:start position:0%
rules and not actually have to be in
 
00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:14.390 align:start position:0%
rules and not actually have to be in
legislation

00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to your second

00:23:22.149 --> 00:23:22.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
would anyone discussion representative
 
00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:27.350 align:start position:0%
would anyone discussion representative
Stone

00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:32.149 --> 00:23:32.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:34.440 align:start position:0%
no I'm good okay
 
00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:35.510 align:start position:0%
no I'm good okay
um

00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:37.909 --> 00:23:37.919 align:start position:0%
initially I like this bill and I still
 
00:23:40.549 --> 00:23:40.559 align:start position:0%
kind of like it but um it's been brought
 
00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:42.120 align:start position:0%
to our attention from the law
 
00:23:43.549 --> 00:23:43.559 align:start position:0%
enforcement community that they would
 
00:23:45.649 --> 00:23:45.659 align:start position:0%
like to have a chance to look at it a
 
00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
little bit further there was some
 
00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:49.980 align:start position:0%
difficulty in getting feedback from all
 
00:23:52.669 --> 00:23:52.679 align:start position:0%
the stakeholders so rather than voice
 
00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
this upon them I'd like to give them a
 
00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
better chance to look at it and give us
 
00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
more input so by retaining the bill it
 
00:24:02.090 --> 00:24:02.100 align:start position:0%
doesn't kill it we'll still act on it by
 
00:24:04.990 --> 00:24:05.000 align:start position:0%
October and we'll come up with something
 
00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:07.980 align:start position:0%
without further discussion I will ask
 
00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:10.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:14.820 align:start position:0%

00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:11.470 align:start position:0%
is there a second
second

00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:11.480 align:start position:0%

Pratt would you like to speak to your
motion

00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
motion
 
00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:18.360 align:start position:0%
this bill is uh in regards to different
 
00:26:19.789 --> 00:26:19.799 align:start position:0%
kind of drugs that we've been looking at
 
00:26:22.269 --> 00:26:22.279 align:start position:0%
all along here this is a lazaric
 
00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:26.240 align:start position:0%
diethylate made mescaline which is LSD
 
00:26:30.529 --> 00:26:30.539 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure I butchered those and
 
00:26:33.409 --> 00:26:33.419 align:start position:0%
there's another one pcps here or any
 
00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
analog similarities to these drugs
 
00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
these drugs uh don't really have a
 
00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:41.220 align:start position:0%
beneficial outcome to the people that
 
00:26:44.330 --> 00:26:44.340 align:start position:0%
take them and I just want to ATL the
 
00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:47.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
represent man you like to speak to a
 
00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:49.909 align:start position:0%
represent man you like to speak to a
second

00:26:49.909 --> 00:26:49.919 align:start position:0%
second
 
00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:52.320 align:start position:0%
uh no I believe he coveted it thank you
 
00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:58.970 --> 00:26:58.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:03.049 --> 00:27:03.059 align:start position:0%
thank you I plan to support the itl but
 
00:27:04.909 --> 00:27:04.919 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I I do want to
 
00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
point out is that
 
00:27:09.049 --> 00:27:09.059 align:start position:0%
um these particular substances have
 
00:27:12.649 --> 00:27:12.659 align:start position:0%
increasingly been shown to help people
 
00:27:14.590 --> 00:27:14.600 align:start position:0%
um who have mental health issues
 
00:27:19.010 --> 00:27:19.020 align:start position:0%
especially folks who have PTSD in other
 
00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:22.020 align:start position:0%
states uh there are legalization efforts
 
00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
that have either succeeded uh or that
 
00:27:26.990 --> 00:27:27.000 align:start position:0%
are in progress and the people asking
 
00:27:30.850 --> 00:27:30.860 align:start position:0%
for this aren't drug users on the street
 
00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:33.240 align:start position:0%
they're people like veterans and police
 
00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:35.450 align:start position:0%
they're people like veterans and police
officers

00:27:35.450 --> 00:27:35.460 align:start position:0%
officers
 
00:27:37.610 --> 00:27:37.620 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately when bills like this
 
00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
come to our committee
 
00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
um we we have to take a very narrow
 
00:27:46.190 --> 00:27:46.200 align:start position:0%
focus on on legalization and how things
 
00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:48.720 align:start position:0%
fit into the controlled Drug Act and and
 
00:27:51.649 --> 00:27:51.659 align:start position:0%
what the potential is for harm across
 
00:27:53.149 --> 00:27:53.159 align:start position:0%
the board
 
00:27:56.269 --> 00:27:56.279 align:start position:0%
um the sad thing is that substances like
 
00:27:56.279 --> 00:27:57.250 align:start position:0%
um the sad thing is that substances like
this

00:27:57.250 --> 00:27:57.260 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:27:59.930 --> 00:27:59.940 align:start position:0%
increasingly are being recognized for
 
00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:03.440 align:start position:0%
the potential for good that they have uh
 
00:28:08.149 --> 00:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
and under the supervision of a of a of a
 
00:28:10.370 --> 00:28:10.380 align:start position:0%
medical doctor or or some type of
 
00:28:13.070 --> 00:28:13.080 align:start position:0%
clinical setting I believe they could be
 
00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
tremendously helpful to people
 
00:28:19.490 --> 00:28:19.500 align:start position:0%
um but straight legalization at this
 
00:28:23.149 --> 00:28:23.159 align:start position:0%
point is something that I I I I don't
 
00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
think we should consider because of the
 
00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:28.320 align:start position:0%
potential impact on younger people
 
00:28:29.930 --> 00:28:29.940 align:start position:0%
um and people who may not understand
 
00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:32.220 align:start position:0%
what they're taking
 
00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:32.870 align:start position:0%
what they're taking
um

00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:35.880 align:start position:0%
so with that said I I do plan to support
 
00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
the itl but for very different reasons
 
00:28:41.810 --> 00:28:41.820 align:start position:0%
than my colleagues thank you
 
00:28:45.529 --> 00:28:45.539 align:start position:0%
thank you I would add that I actually it
 
00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
would be the same reasons as I I think
 
00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:49.320 align:start position:0%
that there are potential benefits in
 
00:28:50.930 --> 00:28:50.940 align:start position:0%
some of these but they need to be
 
00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
medically vetted and and
 
00:28:57.350 --> 00:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
ex not experimented but at least trials
 
00:28:59.570 --> 00:28:59.580 align:start position:0%
in uh in a more controlled setting
 
00:29:01.549 --> 00:29:01.559 align:start position:0%
before they're just we discuss just
 
00:29:03.610 --> 00:29:03.620 align:start position:0%
cutting it Loose to the public at large
 
00:29:07.669 --> 00:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:09.769 --> 00:29:09.779 align:start position:0%
today I learned that five minutes in
 
00:29:12.529 --> 00:29:12.539 align:start position:0%
Amanda's Standard time is 20 minutes
 
00:29:12.539 --> 00:29:13.430 align:start position:0%
Amanda's Standard time is 20 minutes
um

00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:17.390 --> 00:29:17.400 align:start position:0%
I I'd like people within New Hampshire
 
00:29:19.850 --> 00:29:19.860 align:start position:0%
um working in science to be able to
 
00:29:21.289 --> 00:29:21.299 align:start position:0%
study the benefits of this and I think
 
00:29:26.029 --> 00:29:26.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:29.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:32.149 --> 00:29:32.159 align:start position:0%
you know we're here to discuss the
 
00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
criminalization of these substances and
 
00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:36.360 align:start position:0%
I think that
 
00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:38.520 align:start position:0%
through the conversations we've had over
 
00:29:41.269 --> 00:29:41.279 align:start position:0%
the years if some of us have been on the
 
00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:44.460 align:start position:0%
committee for years uh about the
 
00:29:46.730 --> 00:29:46.740 align:start position:0%
legalization of these substances has
 
00:29:48.169 --> 00:29:48.179 align:start position:0%
proved that the criminalization does
 
00:29:51.470 --> 00:29:51.480 align:start position:0%
nothing but allow the law enforcement
 
00:29:54.049 --> 00:29:54.059 align:start position:0%
Community to go and and pick people up
 
00:29:56.450 --> 00:29:56.460 align:start position:0%
for for holding substances that have no
 
00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
real harm to the society at large and
 
00:30:03.169 --> 00:30:03.179 align:start position:0%
frankly I I think that um you know I
 
00:30:04.970 --> 00:30:04.980 align:start position:0%
won't use the term War on Drugs because
 
00:30:06.590 --> 00:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
I don't think that necessarily like you
 
00:30:10.010 --> 00:30:10.020 align:start position:0%
said Mr chairman means much anymore but
 
00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
I will say that the criminalization of
 
00:30:14.269 --> 00:30:14.279 align:start position:0%
these substances has played a serious
 
00:30:16.669 --> 00:30:16.679 align:start position:0%
role in breaking up uh communities
 
00:30:18.889 --> 00:30:18.899 align:start position:0%
across our country and I think that if
 
00:30:21.049 --> 00:30:21.059 align:start position:0%
we want to move forward having them as
 
00:30:22.970 --> 00:30:22.980 align:start position:0%
representative Bolden said study the
 
00:30:25.610 --> 00:30:25.620 align:start position:0%
substance be able to experiment with it
 
00:30:28.010 --> 00:30:28.020 align:start position:0%
as you said Mr chairman I think we have
 
00:30:30.529 --> 00:30:30.539 align:start position:0%
to legalize it and I think we have to I
 
00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
think starting from that standpoint is
 
00:30:35.389 --> 00:30:35.399 align:start position:0%
much better than uh continuing to
 
00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
stigmatize it when frankly this is a
 
00:30:40.970 --> 00:30:40.980 align:start position:0%
substance that that again has no real
 
00:30:43.610 --> 00:30:43.620 align:start position:0%
harm and and does by the studies have
 
00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:45.720 align:start position:0%
serious benefits
 
00:30:47.090 --> 00:30:47.100 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
representative Noel
 
00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
don't worry I'll be quick
 
00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:52.260 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman I just wanted
 
00:30:54.169 --> 00:30:54.179 align:start position:0%
to say agree on all the points actually
 
00:30:54.179 --> 00:30:55.130 align:start position:0%
to say agree on all the points actually
made

00:30:55.130 --> 00:30:55.140 align:start position:0%
made
 
00:30:58.250 --> 00:30:58.260 align:start position:0%
um and I I'm I'm very much supportive of
 
00:31:01.490 --> 00:31:01.500 align:start position:0%
uh legalization and uh regulation but
 
00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
there are steps that need to be taken to
 
00:31:04.850 --> 00:31:04.860 align:start position:0%
get to that because regardless of how we
 
00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:06.720 align:start position:0%
got to this point we are at this point
 
00:31:09.049 --> 00:31:09.059 align:start position:0%
we are where we are and uh especially
 
00:31:11.149 --> 00:31:11.159 align:start position:0%
you know with subsistence being mixed in
 
00:31:12.409 --> 00:31:12.419 align:start position:0%
with other things and stuff like that I
 
00:31:13.730 --> 00:31:13.740 align:start position:0%
think it's very important that we have
 
00:31:16.549 --> 00:31:16.559 align:start position:0%
the Protections in place before we uh
 
00:31:18.169 --> 00:31:18.179 align:start position:0%
just outright legalize something so I'll
 
00:31:20.990 --> 00:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
be supporting the idea thank you and I I
 
00:31:23.690 --> 00:31:23.700 align:start position:0%
would just um I would add that I would I
 
00:31:25.610 --> 00:31:25.620 align:start position:0%
would like to see this come back
 
00:31:27.230 --> 00:31:27.240 align:start position:0%
um in some form in the future as a
 
00:31:30.049 --> 00:31:30.059 align:start position:0%
medical bill versus just a criminal
 
00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:32.640 align:start position:0%
justice Bill representative wheeler
 
00:31:34.789 --> 00:31:34.799 align:start position:0%
the substances are being mixed right now
 
00:31:37.010 --> 00:31:37.020 align:start position:0%
uh there's only so much that we can do
 
00:31:40.549 --> 00:31:40.559 align:start position:0%
as a state to put in protections for
 
00:31:43.850 --> 00:31:43.860 align:start position:0%
people uh with substances like these
 
00:31:45.950 --> 00:31:45.960 align:start position:0%
people will make them
 
00:31:47.810 --> 00:31:47.820 align:start position:0%
regardless of their if they're illegal
 
00:31:48.649 --> 00:31:48.659 align:start position:0%
or not
 
00:31:51.409 --> 00:31:51.419 align:start position:0%
um they will attempt to concoct this
 
00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:54.440 align:start position:0%
substance using High School uh
 
00:31:57.950 --> 00:31:57.960 align:start position:0%
science class level knowledge uh whether
 
00:32:00.350 --> 00:32:00.360 align:start position:0%
we legalize it or not but if it's legal
 
00:32:03.769 --> 00:32:03.779 align:start position:0%
then scientists who right now uh
 
00:32:05.930 --> 00:32:05.940 align:start position:0%
professors who right now have an
 
00:32:07.549 --> 00:32:07.559 align:start position:0%
interest in studying it in New Hampshire
 
00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
schools will be able to pursue their
 
00:32:12.289 --> 00:32:12.299 align:start position:0%
interests without fear of the stigma
 
00:32:14.990 --> 00:32:15.000 align:start position:0%
without fear of criminalization without
 
00:32:17.630 --> 00:32:17.640 align:start position:0%
fear of arrest and actually be able to
 
00:32:19.010 --> 00:32:19.020 align:start position:0%
move forward to get us to the position
 
00:32:20.570 --> 00:32:20.580 align:start position:0%
that representative Newell is looking
 
00:32:22.490 --> 00:32:22.500 align:start position:0%
for legalization of these substances
 
00:32:24.830 --> 00:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
under this legislation gets us to the
 
00:32:26.149 --> 00:32:26.159 align:start position:0%
position that representative Newell is
 
00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
looking for so I will be voting for
 
00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:30.720 align:start position:0%
against the itl motion
 
00:32:32.990 --> 00:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
thank you and I look forward to hearing
 
00:32:34.370 --> 00:32:34.380 align:start position:0%

00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:35.230 align:start position:0%
that compelling speech again on the
floor

00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:35.240 align:start position:0%
floor
 
00:32:38.090 --> 00:32:38.100 align:start position:0%
with that I'll ask the clerk to call the
 
00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:39.590 align:start position:0%
with that I'll ask the clerk to call the
rule

rule
 
00:32:41.630 --> 00:32:41.640 align:start position:0%
Ocean on the floor is an experience
 
00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:42.769 align:start position:0%

chairman if I may I just um what I was
 
00:33:50.509 --> 00:33:50.519 align:start position:0%
going to say was I
 
00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
I have been approached and it's been
 
00:33:54.529 --> 00:33:54.539 align:start position:0%
specifically requested that we actually
 
00:33:56.330 --> 00:33:56.340 align:start position:0%
write down who is going to do the
 
00:33:58.549 --> 00:33:58.559 align:start position:0%
Minority Report
 
00:34:00.889 --> 00:34:00.899 align:start position:0%
um so that in the event that our
 
00:34:02.090 --> 00:34:02.100 align:start position:0%
committee assistant has to chase
 
00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
somebody down she actually knows who
 
00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
she's chasing down and
 
00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:06.350 align:start position:0%
she's chasing down and
um

00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:06.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:08.089 --> 00:34:08.099 align:start position:0%
about the manner of having them done or
 
00:34:09.349 --> 00:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
they're unfortunate not going to be able
 
00:34:12.109 --> 00:34:12.119 align:start position:0%
to be in the calendar for the floor
 
00:34:14.450 --> 00:34:14.460 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chairman I moved to retain
 
00:34:39.589 --> 00:34:39.599 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:41.280 align:start position:0%

chairman um I think we should retain
 
00:34:49.849 --> 00:34:49.859 align:start position:0%
this bill because there's a bill in
 
00:34:54.349 --> 00:34:54.359 align:start position:0%
Commerce already covering this and we
 
00:34:56.869 --> 00:34:56.879 align:start position:0%
need to make sure where that Bill's at
 
00:34:58.849 --> 00:34:58.859 align:start position:0%
because they may have
 
00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:00.720 align:start position:0%
um stripped this part out they may not
 
00:35:03.170 --> 00:35:03.180 align:start position:0%
have so until we get a better handle on
 
00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:06.180 align:start position:0%
what's coming out of con Commerce I
 
00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:08.640 align:start position:0%

I just like to clarify that in um what
 
00:35:24.109 --> 00:35:24.119 align:start position:0%
is it six three eight the one that's in
 
00:35:24.119 --> 00:35:25.250 align:start position:0%

Commerce
 
00:35:27.050 --> 00:35:27.060 align:start position:0%
um it does not include the legalization
 
00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:30.720 align:start position:0%

00:35:32.210 --> 00:35:32.220 align:start position:0%
wish we could vote on this today because
 
00:35:35.329 --> 00:35:35.339 align:start position:0%

um it's it's a home cultivation is not
 
00:35:39.470 --> 00:35:39.480 align:start position:0%
going to be legalized if we don't you
 
00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:41.160 align:start position:0%

committee testified that there is no
 
00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:50.160 align:start position:0%

have standards if you go to the fire

there has not been a telecommunications

Academy that once was held I believe
 
00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
they said by the police academy in many
 
00:38:06.589 --> 00:38:06.599 align:start position:0%
many many years so uh I think that if we
 
00:38:10.310 --> 00:38:10.320 align:start position:0%
standardize the the requirements and
 
00:38:13.069 --> 00:38:13.079 align:start position:0%

need to try to make it 10 minutes yeah I
 
00:40:03.470 --> 00:40:03.480 align:start position:0%
would say about 10 minutes okay um Mr
 
00:40:05.390 --> 00:40:05.400 align:start position:0%
chairman also the amendment that I
 
00:40:07.370 --> 00:40:07.380 align:start position:0%
requested has arrived so I got to go up
 
00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:08.640 align:start position:0%
and make copies so if we can do that
 
00:40:11.089 --> 00:40:11.099 align:start position:0%
okay let's take a 15-minute recess while
 
00:40:13.430 --> 00:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
we collect our amendments and the
 
00:40:15.530 --> 00:40:15.540 align:start position:0%
representatives thank you
 
00:40:17.569 --> 00:40:17.579 align:start position:0%
that's good because my amendment is
 
00:40:19.370 --> 00:40:19.380 align:start position:0%
jacked up too yeah mine's probably
 
00:40:22.310 --> 00:40:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:23.450 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:40:23.450 --> 00:40:23.460 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:40:26.810 --> 00:40:26.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:29.990 --> 00:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
yeah who complained about that the we
 
00:40:31.490 --> 00:40:31.500 align:start position:0%
haven't been putting who was going to be
 
00:40:33.109 --> 00:40:33.119 align:start position:0%
doing The Minority Report because often
 
00:40:35.150 --> 00:40:35.160 align:start position:0%
what's said is somebody will do it and
 
00:40:37.130 --> 00:40:37.140 align:start position:0%
then it's I guess it's not
 
00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:39.480 align:start position:0%
it's just somebody may be doing it but
 
00:40:40.670 --> 00:40:40.680 align:start position:0%
they're not coming in before the
 
00:40:42.050 --> 00:40:42.060 align:start position:0%
calendar to begin and then they have the
 
00:40:42.060 --> 01:09:18.650 align:start position:0%
calendar to begin and then they have the
whole

01:09:18.650 --> 01:09:18.660 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:20.769 --> 01:09:20.779 align:start position:0%
and this time we're going to
 
01:09:24.110 --> 01:09:24.120 align:start position:0%
re-open the executive sessions I believe
 
01:09:25.729 --> 01:09:25.739 align:start position:0%
that we had already opened the
 
01:09:27.410 --> 01:09:27.420 align:start position:0%
executives no I was about to open the
 
01:09:29.530 --> 01:09:29.540 align:start position:0%

01:09:32.749 --> 01:09:32.759 align:start position:0%
41. thank you
 
01:09:34.789 --> 01:09:34.799 align:start position:0%

01:09:36.590 --> 01:09:36.600 align:start position:0%
representative tenzar could you would
 
01:09:37.669 --> 01:09:37.679 align:start position:0%
you mind stepping out and see if
 
01:10:28.070 --> 01:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:29.750 --> 01:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
this time I'm opening the executive
 
01:10:32.149 --> 01:10:32.159 align:start position:0%
session on House Bill 481 relative
 
01:10:34.010 --> 01:10:34.020 align:start position:0%
arrest warrants and I recognize
 
01:10:36.590 --> 01:10:36.600 align:start position:0%
representative janvin for a motion
 
01:10:40.790 --> 01:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman my motion is itl
 
01:10:42.530 --> 01:10:42.540 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
01:10:44.689 --> 01:10:44.699 align:start position:0%
representative Peru
 
01:10:46.070 --> 01:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
representative Jammer would you like to
 
01:10:49.010 --> 01:10:49.020 align:start position:0%
speak your motion yes uh the prime
 
01:10:50.990 --> 01:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
sponsor testified before us and
 
01:10:54.590 --> 01:10:54.600 align:start position:0%
explained his bill quite succinctly uh
 
01:10:57.950 --> 01:10:57.960 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I noticed uh was
 
01:11:01.189 --> 01:11:01.199 align:start position:0%
the bill is seeking to stop police
 
01:11:02.689 --> 01:11:02.699 align:start position:0%
officers from
 
01:11:05.870 --> 01:11:05.880 align:start position:0%
judge shopping I guess is the best uh
 
01:11:07.669 --> 01:11:07.679 align:start position:0%
the best sling to use
 
01:11:10.250 --> 01:11:10.260 align:start position:0%
but what it doesn't take into account is
 
01:11:12.350 --> 01:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
that a Justice of the piece can assign
 
01:11:13.729 --> 01:11:13.739 align:start position:0%
an arrest warrant
 
01:11:15.470 --> 01:11:15.480 align:start position:0%
all they need to be is neutral and
 
01:11:17.390 --> 01:11:17.400 align:start position:0%
detached from the subject
 
01:11:20.689 --> 01:11:20.699 align:start position:0%
that's to be arrested and that would
 
01:11:23.810 --> 01:11:23.820 align:start position:0%
allow say Portsmouth Police Department
 
01:11:25.850 --> 01:11:25.860 align:start position:0%
to go to Northampton police Sergeant
 
01:11:28.189 --> 01:11:28.199 align:start position:0%
who's a justice of the peace and swear
 
01:11:29.810 --> 01:11:29.820 align:start position:0%
out a warrant for the arrest
 
01:11:33.229 --> 01:11:33.239 align:start position:0%
if if this bill were to pass
 
01:11:33.239 --> 01:11:33.890 align:start position:0%
if if this bill were to pass
um

01:11:33.890 --> 01:11:33.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:33.900 --> 01:11:35.330 align:start position:0%
um
and

01:11:35.330 --> 01:11:35.340 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:11:38.870 --> 01:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
the the sergeant in Northampton says I
 
01:11:40.130 --> 01:11:40.140 align:start position:0%
can't sign it because I'm not neutral
 
01:11:42.470 --> 01:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
and detached I arrested them last week
 
01:11:44.570 --> 01:11:44.580 align:start position:0%
now they have to go to another justice
 
01:11:48.290 --> 01:11:48.300 align:start position:0%
of the peace or Justice of the court and
 
01:11:50.590 --> 01:11:50.600 align:start position:0%
um they'd have to make out a big long
 
01:11:52.790 --> 01:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
explanation that we went to this guy
 
01:11:55.310 --> 01:11:55.320 align:start position:0%
he's a justice of the peace and he he
 
01:11:57.590 --> 01:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
didn't deny it but he is not neutral and
 
01:11:57.600 --> 01:11:58.669 align:start position:0%
didn't deny it but he is not neutral and
detached

01:11:58.669 --> 01:11:58.679 align:start position:0%
detached
 
01:12:02.689 --> 01:12:02.699 align:start position:0%
so I can't issue the warrant it just
 
01:12:05.390 --> 01:12:05.400 align:start position:0%
it's an it's a very very
 
01:12:08.810 --> 01:12:08.820 align:start position:0%
unfortunate uh that
 
01:12:11.930 --> 01:12:11.940 align:start position:0%
the bill came to us because it actually
 
01:12:13.729 --> 01:12:13.739 align:start position:0%
makes it so much harder for a police
 
01:12:16.910 --> 01:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
officer to get a warrant when honestly
 
01:12:19.490 --> 01:12:19.500 align:start position:0%
time could be a very very big factor in
 
01:12:21.830 --> 01:12:21.840 align:start position:0%
getting that warrant so I I definitely
 
01:12:24.830 --> 01:12:24.840 align:start position:0%
would like to uh itl the bill for that
 
01:12:27.770 --> 01:12:27.780 align:start position:0%
for that reason thank you Robertson Peru
 
01:12:30.169 --> 01:12:30.179 align:start position:0%
did you want to speak to your second
 
01:12:32.330 --> 01:12:32.340 align:start position:0%
I agree with the other representative
 
01:12:34.550 --> 01:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
and and uh
 
01:12:37.189 --> 01:12:37.199 align:start position:0%
you think it
 
01:12:40.669 --> 01:12:40.679 align:start position:0%
it could cause undue delays in getting a
 
01:12:40.679 --> 01:12:41.750 align:start position:0%
it could cause undue delays in getting a
warrant

01:12:41.750 --> 01:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
warrant
 
01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:42.590 align:start position:0%
warrant
um

01:12:42.590 --> 01:12:42.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:46.970 --> 01:12:46.980 align:start position:0%
and some confusion on on it so I don't
 
01:12:48.470 --> 01:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
think it's the right bill at the right
 
01:12:51.169 --> 01:12:51.179 align:start position:0%
time thank you thank you I would add
 
01:12:53.209 --> 01:12:53.219 align:start position:0%
that it's it's it seems to me on its
 
01:12:56.030 --> 01:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
face rather presumptive that that there
 
01:12:58.910 --> 01:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
are Judges within the court system that
 
01:13:01.610 --> 01:13:01.620 align:start position:0%
that are willing to um to do things they
 
01:13:03.410 --> 01:13:03.420 align:start position:0%
shouldn't so that police officers might
 
01:13:05.630 --> 01:13:05.640 align:start position:0%
be shopping for a certain judge I think
 
01:13:07.430 --> 01:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
that's very presumptive and and I don't
 
01:13:09.110 --> 01:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
I don't think that we should be thinking
 
01:13:11.270 --> 01:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
that way at all borrowing some evidence
 
01:13:13.510 --> 01:13:13.520 align:start position:0%
that it has occurred or is occurring
 
01:13:16.550 --> 01:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
01:13:19.970 --> 01:13:19.980 align:start position:0%
seeing Oh representative Murray
 
01:13:21.770 --> 01:13:21.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:13:23.030 --> 01:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
um I was just wondering if any of my
 
01:13:24.530 --> 01:13:24.540 align:start position:0%
colleagues could offer some
 
01:13:27.470 --> 01:13:27.480 align:start position:0%
clarification regarding my understanding
 
01:13:28.970 --> 01:13:28.980 align:start position:0%
of the bill was that it would simply
 
01:13:32.510 --> 01:13:32.520 align:start position:0%
request that that information be shared
 
01:13:34.430 --> 01:13:34.440 align:start position:0%
and not necessarily that it would stop
 
01:13:36.890 --> 01:13:36.900 align:start position:0%
someone from being able to go to another
 
01:13:43.030 --> 01:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:46.550 --> 01:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
actually yes so in in this situation
 
01:13:48.410 --> 01:13:48.420 align:start position:0%
you're right it would require that it be
 
01:13:50.390 --> 01:13:50.400 align:start position:0%
shared with
 
01:13:52.310 --> 01:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
every time you went to another Justice
 
01:13:53.689 --> 01:13:53.699 align:start position:0%
it would have to be shared to that
 
01:13:56.090 --> 01:13:56.100 align:start position:0%
Justice and the situation I explained
 
01:13:58.189 --> 01:13:58.199 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth PD wants and the rest weren't
 
01:13:59.630 --> 01:13:59.640 align:start position:0%
they go to Northampton that Sergeant
 
01:14:01.550 --> 01:14:01.560 align:start position:0%
says no because I know that person I'm
 
01:14:03.590 --> 01:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
not neutral and detached so now they go
 
01:14:05.450 --> 01:14:05.460 align:start position:0%
to Newington and that Justice of the
 
01:14:08.030 --> 01:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
piece says no I know that person so they
 
01:14:11.570 --> 01:14:11.580 align:start position:0%
go to and they end up before a district
 
01:14:13.550 --> 01:14:13.560 align:start position:0%
court judge
 
01:14:15.530 --> 01:14:15.540 align:start position:0%
um for their warrant because no justice
 
01:14:16.850 --> 01:14:16.860 align:start position:0%
of the peaceful issue it because they
 
01:14:18.950 --> 01:14:18.960 align:start position:0%
all know the guy so now it's going to
 
01:14:20.770 --> 01:14:20.780 align:start position:0%
take that police officer
 
01:14:24.290 --> 01:14:24.300 align:start position:0%
valuable time to explain to the Justice
 
01:14:26.149 --> 01:14:26.159 align:start position:0%
why none of these justices of the piece
 
01:14:29.090 --> 01:14:29.100 align:start position:0%
I issued the warrant so I think it's
 
01:14:35.270 --> 01:14:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:38.149 --> 01:14:38.159 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
01:14:40.189 --> 01:14:40.199 align:start position:0%
representative Newman
 
01:14:42.830 --> 01:14:42.840 align:start position:0%
yeah just to follow up
 
01:14:45.649 --> 01:14:45.659 align:start position:0%
is the significant thing that the judge
 
01:14:48.229 --> 01:14:48.239 align:start position:0%
in that situation that you described or
 
01:14:50.810 --> 01:14:50.820 align:start position:0%
all of the people involved knew the
 
01:14:54.010 --> 01:14:54.020 align:start position:0%
person or is it that they have to bring
 
01:14:57.290 --> 01:14:57.300 align:start position:0%
that type of information to the person
 
01:15:01.010 --> 01:15:01.020 align:start position:0%
and if if that is so it's written so
 
01:15:02.390 --> 01:15:02.400 align:start position:0%
wouldn't they just be taking the same
 
01:15:04.250 --> 01:15:04.260 align:start position:0%
information I'm trying to figure out
 
01:15:07.250 --> 01:15:07.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:11.209 --> 01:15:11.219 align:start position:0%
well actually I I think in the the way I
 
01:15:11.219 --> 01:15:11.930 align:start position:0%
well actually I I think in the the way I
EX

01:15:11.930 --> 01:15:11.940 align:start position:0%
EX
 
01:15:14.270 --> 01:15:14.280 align:start position:0%
the situation I explained
 
01:15:18.169 --> 01:15:18.179 align:start position:0%
um it may not be that the Justice of the
 
01:15:20.390 --> 01:15:20.400 align:start position:0%
Peace So if it goes to the justice and
 
01:15:21.770 --> 01:15:21.780 align:start position:0%
he says they have to give all that
 
01:15:21.780 --> 01:15:22.570 align:start position:0%
he says they have to give all that
information

01:15:22.570 --> 01:15:22.580 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:15:25.430 --> 01:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
the Assumption or the presumption by
 
01:15:27.530 --> 01:15:27.540 align:start position:0%
that Justice may be that the others
 
01:15:27.540 --> 01:15:29.870 align:start position:0%
that Justice may be that the others
denied

01:15:29.870 --> 01:15:29.880 align:start position:0%
denied
 
01:15:32.030 --> 01:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
signing the arrest warrant because there
 
01:15:34.750 --> 01:15:34.760 align:start position:0%
was not probable cause or there was
 
01:15:37.310 --> 01:15:37.320 align:start position:0%
exculpatory evidence or whatever and
 
01:15:39.410 --> 01:15:39.420 align:start position:0%
that police officer again has to explain
 
01:15:41.750 --> 01:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
himself to that Justice I just think
 
01:15:43.610 --> 01:15:43.620 align:start position:0%
that it makes more sense
 
01:15:47.689 --> 01:15:47.699 align:start position:0%
that if if the reason that they're not
 
01:15:49.070 --> 01:15:49.080 align:start position:0%
issuing the warrants because they're not
 
01:15:51.110 --> 01:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
neutral and detached from the subject of
 
01:15:53.810 --> 01:15:53.820 align:start position:0%
their arrest warrant that it really
 
01:15:56.870 --> 01:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
would delay having to explain to the
 
01:15:58.970 --> 01:15:58.980 align:start position:0%
next Justice piece why they didn't get
 
01:16:02.030 --> 01:16:02.040 align:start position:0%
the warrant from the first thank you
 
01:16:04.189 --> 01:16:04.199 align:start position:0%
um I would add that it kind of in a way
 
01:16:06.550 --> 01:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
encourages police officers to have to
 
01:16:10.430 --> 01:16:10.440 align:start position:0%
inject hearsay into a into the warrant
 
01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:11.810 align:start position:0%
inject hearsay into a into the warrant
process

01:16:11.810 --> 01:16:11.820 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:16:14.090 --> 01:16:14.100 align:start position:0%
when they go to one judge they have to
 
01:16:16.070 --> 01:16:16.080 align:start position:0%
say the reason they're speaking on
 
01:16:19.310 --> 01:16:19.320 align:start position:0%
behalf of the other Justice or judge in
 
01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:20.270 align:start position:0%
behalf of the other Justice or judge in
in

01:16:20.270 --> 01:16:20.280 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:16:22.729 --> 01:16:22.739 align:start position:0%
versus that person telling themselves it
 
01:16:25.010 --> 01:16:25.020 align:start position:0%
it interjects something into that isn't
 
01:16:27.050 --> 01:16:27.060 align:start position:0%
there I haven't we didn't hear from
 
01:16:29.450 --> 01:16:29.460 align:start position:0%
anyone about a case where this happened
 
01:16:31.610 --> 01:16:31.620 align:start position:0%
we haven't heard um
 
01:16:33.590 --> 01:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
really anything this is just it seems to
 
01:16:36.770 --> 01:16:36.780 align:start position:0%
me a solution to sort of a problem
 
01:16:38.870 --> 01:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
so for that reason I I would definitely
 
01:16:41.450 --> 01:16:41.460 align:start position:0%
support the itl on this it's a very
 
01:16:44.330 --> 01:16:44.340 align:start position:0%
already a complicated process and when
 
01:16:46.250 --> 01:16:46.260 align:start position:0%
you get into court after and you have
 
01:16:49.070 --> 01:16:49.080 align:start position:0%
defense attorneys looking at
 
01:16:49.080 --> 01:16:50.209 align:start position:0%
defense attorneys looking at
um

01:16:50.209 --> 01:16:50.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:52.790 --> 01:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
reasons to and justifiably that's their
 
01:16:54.890 --> 01:16:54.900 align:start position:0%
job to get their client off and they can
 
01:16:57.050 --> 01:16:57.060 align:start position:0%
start saying wait a minute this officer
 
01:16:59.209 --> 01:16:59.219 align:start position:0%
said this is that exactly what the judge
 
01:17:01.490 --> 01:17:01.500 align:start position:0%
told him you're going to have judges
 
01:17:03.169 --> 01:17:03.179 align:start position:0%
subpoenaed into court as material
 
01:17:06.229 --> 01:17:06.239 align:start position:0%
witnesses as to why they didn't do it or
 
01:17:07.850 --> 01:17:07.860 align:start position:0%
didn't sign it and it's going to
 
01:17:10.189 --> 01:17:10.199 align:start position:0%
complicate the process enormously with
 
01:17:13.070 --> 01:17:13.080 align:start position:0%
that I'd ask the clerk to call the roll
 
01:17:13.080 --> 01:17:16.970 align:start position:0%
that I'd ask the clerk to call the roll

01:19:03.590 --> 01:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
for the crime lab as much as I
 
01:19:04.970 --> 01:19:04.980 align:start position:0%
understand that they're probably
 
01:19:07.970 --> 01:19:07.980 align:start position:0%
underfunded and need more money
 
01:19:07.980 --> 01:19:10.189 align:start position:0%

pretty much exactly what representative
 
01:19:25.550 --> 01:19:25.560 align:start position:0%
proof said I would just add that the the
 
01:19:27.590 --> 01:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
department themselves have not seemed to
 
01:19:29.450 --> 01:19:29.460 align:start position:0%
you know come to come to anybody asking
 
01:19:30.709 --> 01:19:30.719 align:start position:0%
for more funding I think that would be
 
01:19:33.410 --> 01:19:33.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:36.229 --> 01:19:36.239 align:start position:0%

motion yes chairman uh move to itl is
 
01:20:53.330 --> 01:20:53.340 align:start position:0%
there a second
 
01:20:55.250 --> 01:20:55.260 align:start position:0%
second of our representative Stone would
 
01:20:56.149 --> 01:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
you like to speak to your motion
 
01:20:57.649 --> 01:20:57.659 align:start position:0%
representative yes thank you again
 
01:20:59.930 --> 01:20:59.940 align:start position:0%
chairman uh while I appreciate the
 
01:21:01.490 --> 01:21:01.500 align:start position:0%
sponsor in filing this bill I just
 
01:21:02.950 --> 01:21:02.960 align:start position:0%
believe that it is unnecessarily
 
01:21:05.209 --> 01:21:05.219 align:start position:0%
unnecessary and overly punitive in
 
01:21:09.290 --> 01:21:09.300 align:start position:0%
nature the first part of RSA 105 20 part
 
01:21:11.390 --> 01:21:11.400 align:start position:0%
2 Roman numeral 4 is already being
 
01:21:13.070 --> 01:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
conducted by police standards and
 
01:21:16.729 --> 01:21:16.739 align:start position:0%
training uh subjecting an officer to a
 
01:21:18.709 --> 01:21:18.719 align:start position:0%
blood test with a meter complaint of
 
01:21:21.050 --> 01:21:21.060 align:start position:0%
excessive force uh violates that
 
01:21:22.729 --> 01:21:22.739 align:start position:0%
officer's due process and also could
 
01:21:24.709 --> 01:21:24.719 align:start position:0%
violate uh potential collective
 
01:21:27.290 --> 01:21:27.300 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreements
 
01:21:28.729 --> 01:21:28.739 align:start position:0%
thank you would you like to speak to
 
01:21:30.649 --> 01:21:30.659 align:start position:0%
your second representative Stone
 
01:21:33.229 --> 01:21:33.239 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I would like to add that
 
01:21:35.209 --> 01:21:35.219 align:start position:0%
although this does have good intentions
 
01:21:37.970 --> 01:21:37.980 align:start position:0%
the reality is most departments have a
 
01:21:41.270 --> 01:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
policy to establish uh drug uh screening
 
01:21:43.070 --> 01:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
if the department feels is warranted
 
01:21:45.890 --> 01:21:45.900 align:start position:0%
under their collective bargaining
 
01:21:49.130 --> 01:21:49.140 align:start position:0%
thank you I would add that singling out
 
01:21:51.350 --> 01:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
a single substance and saying we're
 
01:21:52.790 --> 01:21:52.800 align:start position:0%
going to test for this single substance
 
01:21:54.770 --> 01:21:54.780 align:start position:0%
every time there's an allegation of this
 
01:21:56.470 --> 01:21:56.480 align:start position:0%
particular ACT
 
01:21:59.930 --> 01:21:59.940 align:start position:0%
first of all it it to the
 
01:22:02.209 --> 01:22:02.219 align:start position:0%
it just eliminates all other
 
01:22:04.910 --> 01:22:04.920 align:start position:0%
possibilities to that one
 
01:22:09.410 --> 01:22:09.420 align:start position:0%
I think that should an investigation of
 
01:22:12.590 --> 01:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
an allegation lead to that point then
 
01:22:14.030 --> 01:22:14.040 align:start position:0%
the local
 
01:22:17.270 --> 01:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
chief of police or or whoever can
 
01:22:19.370 --> 01:22:19.380 align:start position:0%
investigate that aspect of it but
 
01:22:21.470 --> 01:22:21.480 align:start position:0%
mandating that that be part of an
 
01:22:23.090 --> 01:22:23.100 align:start position:0%
investigation before there's even any
 
01:22:23.100 --> 01:22:24.530 align:start position:0%
investigation before there's even any
evidence

01:22:24.530 --> 01:22:24.540 align:start position:0%
evidence
 
01:22:26.090 --> 01:22:26.100 align:start position:0%
um doesn't make any sense to me at all
 
01:22:28.370 --> 01:22:28.380 align:start position:0%
it's an expense and to your point it
 
01:22:30.350 --> 01:22:30.360 align:start position:0%
definitely would affect the collective
 
01:22:32.570 --> 01:22:32.580 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreements further discussion
 
01:22:35.149 --> 01:22:35.159 align:start position:0%
representative Newell
 
01:22:37.610 --> 01:22:37.620 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to clarify because what I
 
01:22:40.370 --> 01:22:40.380 align:start position:0%
have written in my notes is that um
 
01:22:41.750 --> 01:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
was testified to is that hiring
 
01:22:43.729 --> 01:22:43.739 align:start position:0%
standards can be adjusted too and that's
 
01:22:45.169 --> 01:22:45.179 align:start position:0%
just my own warning not like quoting but
 
01:22:46.729 --> 01:22:46.739 align:start position:0%
hiring standards can be adjusted to
 
01:22:48.830 --> 01:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
include steroids and drug tests so to me
 
01:22:50.870 --> 01:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking um you know that is a that
 
01:22:52.130 --> 01:22:52.140 align:start position:0%
is a good part of the bill I think that
 
01:22:53.390 --> 01:22:53.400 align:start position:0%
that's a good thing to be part of the
 
01:22:55.790 --> 01:22:55.800 align:start position:0%
standards and training my question is um
 
01:22:58.370 --> 01:22:58.380 align:start position:0%
that representative tenzar was saying
 
01:22:59.990 --> 01:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
that it is already part of that and I
 
01:23:01.610 --> 01:23:01.620 align:start position:0%
just wanted to clarify whether it is or
 
01:23:03.110 --> 01:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
if that's something that's being
 
01:23:05.030 --> 01:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
considered to be edited
 
01:23:07.010 --> 01:23:07.020 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Stone did you
 
01:23:09.229 --> 01:23:09.239 align:start position:0%
want to reply to that Mr chairman I
 
01:23:11.450 --> 01:23:11.460 align:start position:0%
would uh initial drug screening is done
 
01:23:14.450 --> 01:23:14.460 align:start position:0%
during uh pre-employment already so it's
 
01:23:16.189 --> 01:23:16.199 align:start position:0%
up to the police standings and training
 
01:23:18.410 --> 01:23:18.420 align:start position:0%
and the Hiring Agency to review what
 
01:23:19.850 --> 01:23:19.860 align:start position:0%
drugs they want to be screened for at
 
01:23:21.590 --> 01:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
the time of a conditional offer of
 
01:23:24.770 --> 01:23:24.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:27.830 --> 01:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
um director skip would you like to add
 
01:23:29.930 --> 01:23:29.940 align:start position:0%
to this before we come to a vote did you
 
01:23:31.130 --> 01:23:31.140 align:start position:0%
have anything you wanted to add to that
 
01:23:32.510 --> 01:23:32.520 align:start position:0%
regarding what's going on with the
 
01:23:34.070 --> 01:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
standards and training with regard to
 
01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:38.450 align:start position:0%
standards and training with regard to
that

01:23:38.450 --> 01:23:38.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:40.430 --> 01:23:40.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh thank you

training for the record uh we the uh
 
01:23:48.950 --> 01:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
representative stone is correct that we
 
01:23:52.370 --> 01:23:52.380 align:start position:0%
do uh require that a drug screen be part
 
01:23:56.330 --> 01:23:56.340 align:start position:0%
of the hiring process it's captured in
 
01:23:59.470 --> 01:23:59.480 align:start position:0%
RSA 106l
 
01:24:03.169 --> 01:24:03.179 align:start position:0%
we can do a better job of uh
 
01:24:07.030 --> 01:24:07.040 align:start position:0%
establishing specific uh
 
01:24:09.229 --> 01:24:09.239 align:start position:0%
elements to test for in our
 
01:24:11.510 --> 01:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
administrative rules which uh based on
 
01:24:14.270 --> 01:24:14.280 align:start position:0%
on the movement of this bill is
 
01:24:15.470 --> 01:24:15.480 align:start position:0%
something I'm going to bring back to the
 
01:24:17.689 --> 01:24:17.699 align:start position:0%
council just so that we're we're making
 
01:24:19.729 --> 01:24:19.739 align:start position:0%
sure that that is actually being looked
 
01:24:19.739 --> 01:24:20.390 align:start position:0%
sure that that is actually being looked
at

01:24:20.390 --> 01:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:24:22.010 --> 01:24:22.020 align:start position:0%
thank you the committee appreciates your
 
01:24:24.229 --> 01:24:24.239 align:start position:0%
input and um anything that can be done
 
01:24:26.390 --> 01:24:26.400 align:start position:0%
be rules instead of Statute I think is
 
01:24:28.189 --> 01:24:28.199 align:start position:0%
much better because it can be it's much
 
01:24:30.350 --> 01:24:30.360 align:start position:0%
more flexible to be adjusted thank you
 
01:24:34.430 --> 01:24:34.440 align:start position:0%
for adding to that anything further
 
01:24:36.470 --> 01:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
seeing nonetheless the court to call oh
 
01:24:37.430 --> 01:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
what would I miss oh sorry
 
01:24:40.310 --> 01:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
representative means I just I just
 
01:24:42.290 --> 01:24:42.300 align:start position:0%
wanted to add that uh one of the things
 
01:24:44.030 --> 01:24:44.040 align:start position:0%
that's kind of swaying me is the fact
 
01:24:46.490 --> 01:24:46.500 align:start position:0%
that we really would be taking away the
 
01:24:50.330 --> 01:24:50.340 align:start position:0%
due process rights of of an officer uh
 
01:24:54.350 --> 01:24:54.360 align:start position:0%
uh if we if we simply require them to
 
01:24:56.750 --> 01:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
you know to get this test after any
 
01:24:59.870 --> 01:24:59.880 align:start position:0%
excessive force complaint
 
01:25:03.169 --> 01:25:03.179 align:start position:0%
um and uh and we took action you know
 
01:25:04.790 --> 01:25:04.800 align:start position:0%
without any kind of a hearing so
 
01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:06.890 align:start position:0%
without any kind of a hearing so
basically

01:25:06.890 --> 01:25:06.900 align:start position:0%
basically
 
01:25:08.450 --> 01:25:08.460 align:start position:0%
um you know if if there's an excessive
 
01:25:10.010 --> 01:25:10.020 align:start position:0%
force complaint against you and your
 
01:25:12.290 --> 01:25:12.300 align:start position:0%
test positive you're out
 
01:25:16.729 --> 01:25:16.739 align:start position:0%
um uh it just seems to be a pretty big
 
01:25:18.770 --> 01:25:18.780 align:start position:0%
step to take in addition to some of the
 
01:25:20.870 --> 01:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
other arguments we've heard
 
01:25:23.450 --> 01:25:23.460 align:start position:0%

I hope we understand the bill
 
01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:56.290 align:start position:0%
I hope we understand the bill
um

01:26:56.290 --> 01:26:56.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:59.330 --> 01:26:59.340 align:start position:0%
as a person who utilizes free software
 
01:27:03.530 --> 01:27:03.540 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry open source software uh
 
01:27:06.530 --> 01:27:06.540 align:start position:0%
there are times when a developer May
 
01:27:10.310 --> 01:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
infringe on copyright and to tie the
 
01:27:12.229 --> 01:27:12.239 align:start position:0%
hands of our police
 
01:27:14.030 --> 01:27:14.040 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:27:16.430 --> 01:27:16.440 align:start position:0%
at the state and local level is is kind
 
01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:17.090 align:start position:0%
at the state and local level is is kind
of

01:27:17.090 --> 01:27:17.100 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:27:20.590 --> 01:27:20.600 align:start position:0%
overboard I'll use a couple cases about
 
01:27:23.450 --> 01:27:23.460 align:start position:0%
copywriting Hampton Beach I represent
 
01:27:26.330 --> 01:27:26.340 align:start position:0%
Hampton at Hampton Beach we have people
 
01:27:28.070 --> 01:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
that come in and infringe upon
 
01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:29.330 align:start position:0%
that come in and infringe upon
trademarked

01:27:29.330 --> 01:27:29.340 align:start position:0%
trademarked
 
01:27:32.510 --> 01:27:32.520 align:start position:0%
uh sports gear that sell it there and
 
01:27:34.550 --> 01:27:34.560 align:start position:0%
there are several times where they've
 
01:27:37.729 --> 01:27:37.739 align:start position:0%
been ordered by a court to seize that
 
01:27:40.850 --> 01:27:40.860 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:27:43.790 --> 01:27:43.800 align:start position:0%
I see this bill as saying in that
 
01:27:45.950 --> 01:27:45.960 align:start position:0%
instance the police officers can assist
 
01:27:45.960 --> 01:27:48.890 align:start position:0%
instance the police officers can assist
so

01:27:48.890 --> 01:27:48.900 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:27:50.870 --> 01:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
I I don't see us getting involved in
 
01:27:52.550 --> 01:27:52.560 align:start position:0%
this I mean
 
01:27:54.350 --> 01:27:54.360 align:start position:0%
because it has a criminal penalty
 
01:27:56.149 --> 01:27:56.159 align:start position:0%
attached to it it came to our committee
 
01:27:57.950 --> 01:27:57.960 align:start position:0%
and actually might have done a better
 
01:28:01.250 --> 01:28:01.260 align:start position:0%
job in Commerce but I'm definitely
 
01:28:03.350 --> 01:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
opposed to the to the premise that our
 
01:28:06.229 --> 01:28:06.239 align:start position:0%
local law enforcement and especially the
 
01:28:08.030 --> 01:28:08.040 align:start position:0%
sheriff who deals with civil Lawrence is
 
01:28:10.310 --> 01:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
a civil matter not a criminal matter I
 
01:28:13.070 --> 01:28:13.080 align:start position:0%
think that it just needs to die on the
 
01:28:14.830 --> 01:28:14.840 align:start position:0%
tree it came from
 
01:28:16.970 --> 01:28:16.980 align:start position:0%
representative gathright would you like
 
01:28:22.189 --> 01:28:22.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:22.199 --> 01:28:23.390 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:28:23.390 --> 01:28:23.400 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:28:26.030 --> 01:28:26.040 align:start position:0%
I just found it to be sort of confusing
 
01:28:29.209 --> 01:28:29.219 align:start position:0%
me because it's an open source but I
 
01:28:30.530 --> 01:28:30.540 align:start position:0%
thought that was the purpose of the
 
01:28:31.970 --> 01:28:31.980 align:start position:0%
software but
 
01:28:34.610 --> 01:28:34.620 align:start position:0%
other than that
 
01:28:35.870 --> 01:28:35.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:28:38.149 --> 01:28:38.159 align:start position:0%
um I would just say that I think we have
 
01:28:40.129 --> 01:28:40.139 align:start position:0%
um enough criminal laws and we should
 
01:28:42.350 --> 01:28:42.360 align:start position:0%
not be getting into tort law and making
 
01:28:43.550 --> 01:28:43.560 align:start position:0%
a criminal
 
01:28:43.560 --> 01:28:44.270 align:start position:0%
a criminal
um

01:28:44.270 --> 01:28:44.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:47.570 --> 01:28:47.580 align:start position:0%
so any further discussion
 
01:28:47.580 --> 01:28:51.649 align:start position:0%
so any further discussion
legislate

01:28:51.649 --> 01:28:51.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:54.530 --> 01:28:54.540 align:start position:0%

01:30:52.610 --> 01:30:52.620 align:start position:0%
um everybody that was on the
 
01:30:54.590 --> 01:30:54.600 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and also the stakeholders
 
01:30:57.890 --> 01:30:57.900 align:start position:0%
that were here to offer their expertise
 
01:30:59.689 --> 01:30:59.699 align:start position:0%
on the situation
 
01:31:02.149 --> 01:31:02.159 align:start position:0%
um we all went over it when I say with a
 
01:31:04.310 --> 01:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
fine tooth comb I mean down to how we
 
01:31:07.910 --> 01:31:07.920 align:start position:0%
actually put the sentences in order and
 
01:31:11.030 --> 01:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
we addressed all of these situations
 
01:31:12.530 --> 01:31:12.540 align:start position:0%
that were brought to our attention that
 
01:31:14.390 --> 01:31:14.400 align:start position:0%
we all found pretty egregious and we
 
01:31:15.890 --> 01:31:15.900 align:start position:0%
fixed that so I would just ask everybody
 
01:31:20.270 --> 01:31:20.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:21.649 --> 01:31:21.659 align:start position:0%
would like to speak to your second
 
01:31:24.169 --> 01:31:24.179 align:start position:0%
representative Reed I concur with um
 
01:31:26.930 --> 01:31:26.940 align:start position:0%
Bryce German Rhodes thank you I would
 
01:31:29.090 --> 01:31:29.100 align:start position:0%
ask representative Rhodes
 
01:31:29.100 --> 01:31:30.229 align:start position:0%
ask representative Rhodes
um

01:31:30.229 --> 01:31:30.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:34.610 --> 01:31:34.620 align:start position:0%
did the commissioner Hanks endorse this
 
01:31:36.550 --> 01:31:36.560 align:start position:0%
as it is
 
01:31:40.310 --> 01:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
commissioner Hanks um had her I would
 
01:31:42.229 --> 01:31:42.239 align:start position:0%
say associate was the other day and this
 
01:31:44.689 --> 01:31:44.699 align:start position:0%
was actually actually a lot of it was
 
01:31:46.129 --> 01:31:46.139 align:start position:0%
written with her here
 
01:31:48.410 --> 01:31:48.420 align:start position:0%
so the answer that is yes and did you
 
01:31:51.129 --> 01:31:51.139 align:start position:0%
invite representatives from the County
 
01:31:53.209 --> 01:31:53.219 align:start position:0%
correctional facilities yeah thank you
 
01:31:55.610 --> 01:31:55.620 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman yes an email was sent out to
 
01:31:58.370 --> 01:31:58.380 align:start position:0%
um the counties and I was actually given
 
01:31:59.290 --> 01:31:59.300 align:start position:0%
that information
 
01:32:01.370 --> 01:32:01.380 align:start position:0%
from the stakeholders make sure I had
 
01:32:02.629 --> 01:32:02.639 align:start position:0%
the right addresses so everybody that
 
01:32:04.910 --> 01:32:04.920 align:start position:0%
was here had had their input
 
01:32:08.930 --> 01:32:08.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:12.890 --> 01:32:12.900 align:start position:0%
I do not believe so okay thank you
 
01:32:12.900 --> 01:32:13.550 align:start position:0%
I do not believe so okay thank you
um

01:32:13.550 --> 01:32:13.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:16.010 --> 01:32:16.020 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll just say that I think that the
 
01:32:18.229 --> 01:32:18.239 align:start position:0%
testimony we've heard was was
 
01:32:20.629 --> 01:32:20.639 align:start position:0%
um for lack of a better term horrific
 
01:32:22.189 --> 01:32:22.199 align:start position:0%
um and I'm glad that we were able to
 
01:32:23.570 --> 01:32:23.580 align:start position:0%
come together on a piece of legislation
 
01:32:25.790 --> 01:32:25.800 align:start position:0%
to fix it I'm extremely disappointed
 
01:32:28.490 --> 01:32:28.500 align:start position:0%
that no one from the counties came
 
01:32:28.500 --> 01:32:29.330 align:start position:0%
that no one from the counties came
um

01:32:29.330 --> 01:32:29.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:31.610 --> 01:32:31.620 align:start position:0%
but they did have their opportunity so
 
01:32:34.189 --> 01:32:34.199 align:start position:0%
having said that anyone else
 
01:32:36.649 --> 01:32:36.659 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler totally agree
 
01:32:38.209 --> 01:32:38.219 align:start position:0%
with what you said Mr chairman the
 
01:32:39.890 --> 01:32:39.900 align:start position:0%
testimony that we heard in regards to
 
01:32:42.530 --> 01:32:42.540 align:start position:0%
this bill was appalling and the fact
 
01:32:44.090 --> 01:32:44.100 align:start position:0%
that that's going on in our County jails
 
01:32:47.330 --> 01:32:47.340 align:start position:0%
is appalling and I know I'm on my County
 
01:32:49.370 --> 01:32:49.380 align:start position:0%
delegation and I will do whatever I can
 
01:32:51.290 --> 01:32:51.300 align:start position:0%
to investigate that further and hope
 
01:32:52.970 --> 01:32:52.980 align:start position:0%
anyone else who is on their County
 
01:32:54.950 --> 01:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
delegation or who knows uh the
 
01:32:56.450 --> 01:32:56.460 align:start position:0%
representative in their District who is
 
01:32:58.490 --> 01:32:58.500 align:start position:0%
that they would ask that they do the
 
01:33:01.250 --> 01:33:01.260 align:start position:0%
same thank you that is uh
 
01:33:03.110 --> 01:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
that's well taken anyone else
 
01:33:05.510 --> 01:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
representative Bolden I'm not one to
 
01:33:08.689 --> 01:33:08.699 align:start position:0%
defend the county prisons or jails but
 
01:33:10.189 --> 01:33:10.199 align:start position:0%
um I do think in their defense that they
 
01:33:11.870 --> 01:33:11.880 align:start position:0%
were present for the initial
 
01:33:14.209 --> 01:33:14.219 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting out specifically a
 
01:33:16.129 --> 01:33:16.139 align:start position:0%
lobbyist representing them was sitting
 
01:33:19.010 --> 01:33:19.020 align:start position:0%
next to you if I remember correctly
 
01:33:19.020 --> 01:33:20.209 align:start position:0%
next to you if I remember correctly
and

01:33:20.209 --> 01:33:20.219 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:33:22.129 --> 01:33:22.139 align:start position:0%
I think she was fine with everything too
 
01:33:24.290 --> 01:33:24.300 align:start position:0%
she was pretty she participated that's
 
01:33:26.330 --> 01:33:26.340 align:start position:0%
what I was asking I couldn't
 
01:33:28.550 --> 01:33:28.560 align:start position:0%
did they offer any input as to what's
 
01:33:30.590 --> 01:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
going on in their facilities
 
01:33:32.870 --> 01:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
she participated in a conversation
 
01:33:34.129 --> 01:33:34.139 align:start position:0%
it's been a couple weeks and I'm pretty
 
01:33:35.629 --> 01:33:35.639 align:start position:0%
tired so I don't know
 
01:33:38.090 --> 01:33:38.100 align:start position:0%
okay I'll take it that it was uh
 
01:33:40.129 --> 01:33:40.139 align:start position:0%
impactful testimony
 
01:33:40.139 --> 01:33:41.090 align:start position:0%
impactful testimony
um

01:33:41.090 --> 01:33:41.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:42.709 --> 01:33:42.719 align:start position:0%

01:33:44.149 --> 01:33:44.159 align:start position:0%

House Bill 135 and I recognize myself to
 
01:36:11.330 --> 01:36:11.340 align:start position:0%
offer an amendment
 
01:36:14.510 --> 01:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
I'm offering amendment number zero six
 
01:36:16.910 --> 01:36:16.920 align:start position:0%
eight or h
 
01:36:16.920 --> 01:36:18.050 align:start position:0%
eight or h
second

01:36:18.050 --> 01:36:18.060 align:start position:0%
second
 
01:36:21.770 --> 01:36:21.780 align:start position:0%
thank you I'll speak to the amendment
 
01:36:25.310 --> 01:36:25.320 align:start position:0%
the amendment basically adds a section
 
01:36:27.830 --> 01:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
to this bill this bill was brought to us
 
01:36:30.950 --> 01:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
to ban no knock search warrants
 
01:36:33.950 --> 01:36:33.960 align:start position:0%
we heard testimony from law enforcement
 
01:36:33.960 --> 01:36:35.149 align:start position:0%
we heard testimony from law enforcement
that

01:36:35.149 --> 01:36:35.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:36:37.910 --> 01:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
it's basically not being done now with
 
01:36:41.450 --> 01:36:41.460 align:start position:0%
regard to evidentiary purposes the
 
01:36:44.470 --> 01:36:44.480 align:start position:0%
public the public doesn't want these
 
01:36:47.450 --> 01:36:47.460 align:start position:0%
they oftentimes result in injuries to
 
01:36:50.270 --> 01:36:50.280 align:start position:0%
either officers or people it's a it's we
 
01:36:53.510 --> 01:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
asked the police to carry out and um
 
01:36:56.270 --> 01:36:56.280 align:start position:0%
enforce the laws that we write
 
01:37:00.410 --> 01:37:00.420 align:start position:0%
and in so doing we have to ensure that
 
01:37:03.229 --> 01:37:03.239 align:start position:0%
we give them the tools to do it while at
 
01:37:05.570 --> 01:37:05.580 align:start position:0%
the same time balancing that with the
 
01:37:07.430 --> 01:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
rights of the public to be safe
 
01:37:09.709 --> 01:37:09.719 align:start position:0%
and I think this bill accomplishes that
 
01:37:12.770 --> 01:37:12.780 align:start position:0%
what this amendment does is basically
 
01:37:14.750 --> 01:37:14.760 align:start position:0%
almost verbatim
 
01:37:16.729 --> 01:37:16.739 align:start position:0%
takes the policy of the United States
 
01:37:18.770 --> 01:37:18.780 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice pursuant to
 
01:37:21.950 --> 01:37:21.960 align:start position:0%
President Biden's executive order on no
 
01:37:24.169 --> 01:37:24.179 align:start position:0%
knock warrants and adopts it and applies
 
01:37:26.270 --> 01:37:26.280 align:start position:0%
it for the state
 
01:37:28.430 --> 01:37:28.440 align:start position:0%
what it does is it bans no knock
 
01:37:30.290 --> 01:37:30.300 align:start position:0%
warrants except for in the case of a law
 
01:37:32.750 --> 01:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer safety or the safety
 
01:37:34.129 --> 01:37:34.139 align:start position:0%
of someone there
 
01:37:36.890 --> 01:37:36.900 align:start position:0%
I think that's pretty self-explanatory
 
01:37:38.930 --> 01:37:38.940 align:start position:0%
it requires them to get permission from
 
01:37:41.870 --> 01:37:41.880 align:start position:0%
their chief law enforcement officer
 
01:37:44.510 --> 01:37:44.520 align:start position:0%
it also has an exception
 
01:37:46.610 --> 01:37:46.620 align:start position:0%
if the officer does not have a no-nock
 
01:37:49.010 --> 01:37:49.020 align:start position:0%
warrant but upon arriving to execute the
 
01:37:51.470 --> 01:37:51.480 align:start position:0%
warrant they discover that
 
01:37:53.570 --> 01:37:53.580 align:start position:0%
evidence exists that would make the no
 
01:37:56.209 --> 01:37:56.219 align:start position:0%
knock warrant necessary again only for
 
01:37:58.430 --> 01:37:58.440 align:start position:0%
safety purposes of someone there or the
 
01:37:58.440 --> 01:37:59.750 align:start position:0%
safety purposes of someone there or the
officers

01:37:59.750 --> 01:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
officers
 
01:38:03.169 --> 01:38:03.179 align:start position:0%
again I think that's self-explanatory
 
01:38:05.990 --> 01:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
there is one exception for evidentiary
 
01:38:08.750 --> 01:38:08.760 align:start position:0%
and that's an extreme exception that
 
01:38:10.370 --> 01:38:10.380 align:start position:0%
would be for example
 
01:38:12.110 --> 01:38:12.120 align:start position:0%
and this isn't limited to that but it's
 
01:38:14.750 --> 01:38:14.760 align:start position:0%
an example if they discover there's
 
01:38:16.250 --> 01:38:16.260 align:start position:0%
someone's been kidnapped or there's
 
01:38:19.669 --> 01:38:19.679 align:start position:0%
evidence of human trafficking and if the
 
01:38:21.229 --> 01:38:21.239 align:start position:0%
officers were to knock and announce
 
01:38:23.750 --> 01:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
there's a great possibility that the
 
01:38:25.310 --> 01:38:25.320 align:start position:0%
evidence could be destroyed which could
 
01:38:28.070 --> 01:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
locate a missing person or a trafficked
 
01:38:28.080 --> 01:38:29.450 align:start position:0%
locate a missing person or a trafficked
person

01:38:29.450 --> 01:38:29.460 align:start position:0%
person
 
01:38:32.689 --> 01:38:32.699 align:start position:0%
they can get a no knock for that but we
 
01:38:34.550 --> 01:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
have put a pretty high bar they have to
 
01:38:36.050 --> 01:38:36.060 align:start position:0%
get permission from their chief law
 
01:38:38.149 --> 01:38:38.159 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer and from the
 
01:38:39.229 --> 01:38:39.239 align:start position:0%
district attorney or the Attorney
 
01:38:41.330 --> 01:38:41.340 align:start position:0%
General of their designee
 
01:38:43.790 --> 01:38:43.800 align:start position:0%
so this sends a clear message that we
 
01:38:45.530 --> 01:38:45.540 align:start position:0%
frown on no knock warrants except we're
 
01:38:45.540 --> 01:38:46.430 align:start position:0%
frown on no knock warrants except we're
in

01:38:46.430 --> 01:38:46.440 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:38:49.370 --> 01:38:49.380 align:start position:0%
extremely limited circumstances and with
 
01:38:49.380 --> 01:38:50.330 align:start position:0%
extremely limited circumstances and with
that

01:38:50.330 --> 01:38:50.340 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:38:52.149 --> 01:38:52.159 align:start position:0%
I open it for further discussion
 
01:38:55.070 --> 01:38:55.080 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler question to the
 
01:38:55.080 --> 01:38:55.790 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler question to the
chair

01:38:55.790 --> 01:38:55.800 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:38:57.950 --> 01:38:57.960 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:39:00.890 --> 01:39:00.900 align:start position:0%
to clarify if a law enforcement officer
 
01:39:04.490 --> 01:39:04.500 align:start position:0%
felt that his safety was in danger he
 
01:39:07.610 --> 01:39:07.620 align:start position:0%
could pursue a no knock warrant
 
01:39:09.890 --> 01:39:09.900 align:start position:0%
um in in pursuant to the second
 
01:39:13.610 --> 01:39:13.620 align:start position:0%
exception if an officer has a regular
 
01:39:15.050 --> 01:39:15.060 align:start position:0%
Source warrant that's not a no knock
 
01:39:17.450 --> 01:39:17.460 align:start position:0%
warrant they go to execute that warrant
 
01:39:19.610 --> 01:39:19.620 align:start position:0%
and they discover when they get there
 
01:39:21.890 --> 01:39:21.900 align:start position:0%
before entering that there's a violent
 
01:39:23.990 --> 01:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
person who may have a firearm
 
01:39:26.209 --> 01:39:26.219 align:start position:0%
in order to keep them from having to
 
01:39:27.950 --> 01:39:27.960 align:start position:0%
leave and go back and get the known walk
 
01:39:29.810 --> 01:39:29.820 align:start position:0%
they can execute or no knock at that
 
01:39:31.970 --> 01:39:31.980 align:start position:0%
point they have to immediately report
 
01:39:33.590 --> 01:39:33.600 align:start position:0%
that they've done so to the chief law
 
01:39:35.270 --> 01:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer who has to also
 
01:39:37.070 --> 01:39:37.080 align:start position:0%
report it to the district attorney and
 
01:39:38.870 --> 01:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
they have to articulate why they felt
 
01:39:40.310 --> 01:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
that that was very necessary at that
 
01:39:42.229 --> 01:39:42.239 align:start position:0%
time but that's the only exception they
 
01:39:43.430 --> 01:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
would not be able to show up and say
 
01:39:45.530 --> 01:39:45.540 align:start position:0%
well there's more evidence and we're
 
01:39:46.550 --> 01:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
going to lose the evidence so we're
 
01:39:47.450 --> 01:39:47.460 align:start position:0%
going to do a no knock without
 
01:39:50.149 --> 01:39:50.159 align:start position:0%
permission that they can't do only exits
 
01:39:51.770 --> 01:39:51.780 align:start position:0%
and circumstances when they get there to
 
01:39:53.450 --> 01:39:53.460 align:start position:0%
do the warrant they see this could be
 
01:39:54.950 --> 01:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
dangerous if we knock and that guy knows
 
01:39:56.090 --> 01:39:56.100 align:start position:0%
we're out here
 
01:39:57.729 --> 01:39:57.739 align:start position:0%
does that explain it it does
 
01:40:00.229 --> 01:40:00.239 align:start position:0%
representative mannion thank you Mr
 
01:40:00.239 --> 01:40:01.129 align:start position:0%
representative mannion thank you Mr
chair

01:40:01.129 --> 01:40:01.139 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:40:02.270 --> 01:40:02.280 align:start position:0%
um before I start I just want to let
 
01:40:03.770 --> 01:40:03.780 align:start position:0%
everyone know that I've been in law
 
01:40:05.930 --> 01:40:05.940 align:start position:0%
enforcement about 30 years I'm retired
 
01:40:07.189 --> 01:40:07.199 align:start position:0%
however I still work on a part-time
 
01:40:10.189 --> 01:40:10.199 align:start position:0%
capacity before I speak on this but we
 
01:40:11.750 --> 01:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
heard testimony I can tell you and it's
 
01:40:13.790 --> 01:40:13.800 align:start position:0%
been in my experience that these
 
01:40:16.310 --> 01:40:16.320 align:start position:0%
no knock warrants or any high risk
 
01:40:18.229 --> 01:40:18.239 align:start position:0%
warrants are done by specialized teams
 
01:40:20.570 --> 01:40:20.580 align:start position:0%
it's not two offices that are going to
 
01:40:22.250 --> 01:40:22.260 align:start position:0%
show up and kick a door in it's
 
01:40:24.770 --> 01:40:24.780 align:start position:0%
specialized teams that are trained there
 
01:40:26.750 --> 01:40:26.760 align:start position:0%
are supervisors that supervise those
 
01:40:29.570 --> 01:40:29.580 align:start position:0%
teams and we heard testimony from
 
01:40:30.890 --> 01:40:30.900 align:start position:0%
Manchester that
 
01:40:33.110 --> 01:40:33.120 align:start position:0%
contrary to what we see on TV they don't
 
01:40:34.850 --> 01:40:34.860 align:start position:0%
kick doors in wearing black clothes and
 
01:40:37.669 --> 01:40:37.679 align:start position:0%
masks and rush in and grab someone they
 
01:40:39.470 --> 01:40:39.480 align:start position:0%
open the door they breach the door so
 
01:40:40.910 --> 01:40:40.920 align:start position:0%
they can get a look inside before they
 
01:40:42.590 --> 01:40:42.600 align:start position:0%
make entry and that's generally how it's
 
01:40:44.390 --> 01:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
done today in my experience and we've
 
01:40:46.610 --> 01:40:46.620 align:start position:0%
heard testimony on that that's so they
 
01:40:48.350 --> 01:40:48.360 align:start position:0%
can take a look in the house before they
 
01:40:49.790 --> 01:40:49.800 align:start position:0%
make entry and they announce themselves
 
01:40:51.709 --> 01:40:51.719 align:start position:0%
before they go in they don't just kick
 
01:40:53.689 --> 01:40:53.699 align:start position:0%
the door and then rush in so
 
01:40:55.610 --> 01:40:55.620 align:start position:0%
um and that's my experience and that's
 
01:40:56.990 --> 01:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
what I think we've heard as testimony is
 
01:40:59.450 --> 01:40:59.460 align:start position:0%
how it's done so what we see on TV is
 
01:41:01.189 --> 01:41:01.199 align:start position:0%
not necessarily not necessarily how it's
 
01:41:02.450 --> 01:41:02.460 align:start position:0%
done in New Hampshire
 
01:41:03.709 --> 01:41:03.719 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:41:05.510 --> 01:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
and I definitely agree that was the
 
01:41:07.790 --> 01:41:07.800 align:start position:0%
testimony we heard and all this bill
 
01:41:10.370 --> 01:41:10.380 align:start position:0%
does is really just codify what they're
 
01:41:11.870 --> 01:41:11.880 align:start position:0%
already doing
 
01:41:15.050 --> 01:41:15.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:17.629 --> 01:41:17.639 align:start position:0%
um I guess you know what I would say is
 
01:41:17.639 --> 01:41:18.890 align:start position:0%
um I guess you know what I would say is
that

01:41:18.890 --> 01:41:18.900 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:41:21.649 --> 01:41:21.659 align:start position:0%
um I just hope that there is a really a
 
01:41:23.990 --> 01:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
really high bar for taking that action
 
01:41:25.250 --> 01:41:25.260 align:start position:0%
and it seems like you've written that
 
01:41:27.169 --> 01:41:27.179 align:start position:0%
into this amendment
 
01:41:28.669 --> 01:41:28.679 align:start position:0%
um and so I'm going to vote for it I
 
01:41:30.470 --> 01:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
just I you know I hope that as it's
 
01:41:33.770 --> 01:41:33.780 align:start position:0%
implemented it's abided by in that way
 
01:41:35.930 --> 01:41:35.940 align:start position:0%
that we really Reserve that for extreme
 
01:41:37.970 --> 01:41:37.980 align:start position:0%
situations like that thank you and I
 
01:41:39.950 --> 01:41:39.960 align:start position:0%
also wrote Into the bill that
 
01:41:42.830 --> 01:41:42.840 align:start position:0%
um won a warrant like this is executed
 
01:41:45.109 --> 01:41:45.119 align:start position:0%
once the return is made that means when
 
01:41:46.490 --> 01:41:46.500 align:start position:0%
they give it back to the court and say
 
01:41:47.750 --> 01:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
this is what we did and this is what we
 
01:41:49.729 --> 01:41:49.739 align:start position:0%
found it becomes immediately public
 
01:41:52.669 --> 01:41:52.679 align:start position:0%
information so that we can watch and see
 
01:41:54.169 --> 01:41:54.179 align:start position:0%
in the public has a full view of what's
 
01:41:55.550 --> 01:41:55.560 align:start position:0%
going on
 
01:42:00.050 --> 01:42:00.060 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative Muse
 
01:42:02.330 --> 01:42:02.340 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to say that I am I'm going
 
01:42:03.709 --> 01:42:03.719 align:start position:0%
to support the bill
 
01:42:05.750 --> 01:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
um and one of the reasons for that is I
 
01:42:08.810 --> 01:42:08.820 align:start position:0%
don't think uh we should try to toss out
 
01:42:11.390 --> 01:42:11.400 align:start position:0%
uh the good and quest of the perfect
 
01:42:13.790 --> 01:42:13.800 align:start position:0%
um I'd be the first to say that I have
 
01:42:16.129 --> 01:42:16.139 align:start position:0%
some concerns about some of the
 
01:42:21.109 --> 01:42:21.119 align:start position:0%
exceptions I have concerns that the
 
01:42:23.810 --> 01:42:23.820 align:start position:0%
language may be a little bit tough for
 
01:42:27.229 --> 01:42:27.239 align:start position:0%
individual officers to interpret
 
01:42:29.810 --> 01:42:29.820 align:start position:0%
um but I think we owe police standards
 
01:42:32.209 --> 01:42:32.219 align:start position:0%
in training and the local agencies the
 
01:42:33.770 --> 01:42:33.780 align:start position:0%
benefit of a doubt when it comes to
 
01:42:35.330 --> 01:42:35.340 align:start position:0%
properly communicating what the guard
 
01:42:38.570 --> 01:42:38.580 align:start position:0%
rails are around this process
 
01:42:40.609 --> 01:42:40.619 align:start position:0%
um so with that in mind I I plan to
 
01:42:43.729 --> 01:42:43.739 align:start position:0%
support it and I hope that that the
 
01:42:47.090 --> 01:42:47.100 align:start position:0%
statute has its intended effect
 
01:42:49.729 --> 01:42:49.739 align:start position:0%
thank you and if it doesn't we'll be
 
01:42:52.010 --> 01:42:52.020 align:start position:0%
here to to fix it
 
01:42:54.770 --> 01:42:54.780 align:start position:0%
um representative Pratt
 
01:42:57.229 --> 01:42:57.239 align:start position:0%
I studied the original amendment can you
 
01:42:58.370 --> 01:42:58.380 align:start position:0%
tell me what the difference is between
 
01:43:01.189 --> 01:43:01.199 align:start position:0%
zero six eight four and zero six eight
 
01:43:01.199 --> 01:43:02.030 align:start position:0%
zero six eight four and zero six eight
one

01:43:02.030 --> 01:43:02.040 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:43:05.209 --> 01:43:05.219 align:start position:0%
yes that's the request of um State
 
01:43:05.219 --> 01:43:06.410 align:start position:0%
yes that's the request of um State
Police

01:43:06.410 --> 01:43:06.420 align:start position:0%
Police
 
01:43:08.510 --> 01:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
the sentence that said if no one
 
01:43:11.689 --> 01:43:11.699 align:start position:0%
answered would cause them it had the
 
01:43:13.669 --> 01:43:13.679 align:start position:0%
inadvertent effect of it would actually
 
01:43:15.470 --> 01:43:15.480 align:start position:0%
freeze them in place if no one answered
 
01:43:16.850 --> 01:43:16.860 align:start position:0%
the door they would just be stuck there
 
01:43:18.410 --> 01:43:18.420 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't be able to execute the
 
01:43:19.910 --> 01:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
warrant I don't think that was the
 
01:43:21.950 --> 01:43:21.960 align:start position:0%
intent and also
 
01:43:24.410 --> 01:43:24.420 align:start position:0%
um I did increase it said next business
 
01:43:27.950 --> 01:43:27.960 align:start position:0%
day on page two and at the request of uh
 
01:43:31.310 --> 01:43:31.320 align:start position:0%
Chief bronowski I extended it to 48
 
01:43:32.750 --> 01:43:32.760 align:start position:0%
hours just because it can be difficult
 
01:43:34.129 --> 01:43:34.139 align:start position:0%
in the North Country for them to track
 
01:43:36.169 --> 01:43:36.179 align:start position:0%
down a district attorney to make this
 
01:43:39.890 --> 01:43:39.900 align:start position:0%
report too or if it's on a weekend it
 
01:43:42.590 --> 01:43:42.600 align:start position:0%
just gives them another day
 
01:43:46.310 --> 01:43:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:49.010 --> 01:43:49.020 align:start position:0%
excuse me Rhodes thank you Mr chairman I
 
01:43:51.709 --> 01:43:51.719 align:start position:0%
I just would like to add that
 
01:43:55.310 --> 01:43:55.320 align:start position:0%
I I'm actually very very happy that the
 
01:43:57.890 --> 01:43:57.900 align:start position:0%
exception for human trafficking human
 
01:44:00.129 --> 01:44:00.139 align:start position:0%
trafficking or any missing persons was
 
01:44:02.930 --> 01:44:02.940 align:start position:0%
made sure to be an exception so that we
 
01:44:05.090 --> 01:44:05.100 align:start position:0%
can do everything we can do to
 
01:44:06.890 --> 01:44:06.900 align:start position:0%
help save these people
 
01:44:10.070 --> 01:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:12.350 --> 01:44:12.360 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy I'm sorry oh thank
 
01:44:14.629 --> 01:44:14.639 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I just wanted to say I will
 
01:44:16.490 --> 01:44:16.500 align:start position:0%
definitely be in support of this
 
01:44:19.129 --> 01:44:19.139 align:start position:0%
amendment so I think it actually
 
01:44:23.750 --> 01:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh it benefits both the public and law
 
01:44:26.390 --> 01:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
enforcement uh the best interest of both
 
01:44:32.870 --> 01:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:35.149 --> 01:44:35.159 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:44:35.159 --> 01:44:35.930 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
um

01:44:35.930 --> 01:44:35.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:38.689 --> 01:44:38.699 align:start position:0%
representative new uh Newman
 
01:44:40.550 --> 01:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
yeah I just have a quick question about
 
01:44:43.370 --> 01:44:43.380 align:start position:0%
the uh the only Authority that they have
 
01:44:46.370 --> 01:44:46.380 align:start position:0%
to see is that the chi the chief of the
 
01:44:48.590 --> 01:44:48.600 align:start position:0%
department if they make a request when
 
01:44:50.209 --> 01:44:50.219 align:start position:0%
they have to use one because there's
 
01:44:54.470 --> 01:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
danger to a a person
 
01:44:57.770 --> 01:44:57.780 align:start position:0%
um and my I just wanted clarification to
 
01:45:00.830 --> 01:45:00.840 align:start position:0%
we also heard testimony here that all
 
01:45:02.930 --> 01:45:02.940 align:start position:0%
right comments here
 
01:45:05.810 --> 01:45:05.820 align:start position:0%
that uh for the for the no knock Warren
 
01:45:09.050 --> 01:45:09.060 align:start position:0%
warrant they use a lot of times special
 
01:45:11.870 --> 01:45:11.880 align:start position:0%
um SWOT operations or whatever they do
 
01:45:15.050 --> 01:45:15.060 align:start position:0%
to to accomplish that and is that what
 
01:45:17.629 --> 01:45:17.639 align:start position:0%
you think would happen if if
 
01:45:19.490 --> 01:45:19.500 align:start position:0%
I just see how often that how happened
 
01:45:22.189 --> 01:45:22.199 align:start position:0%
how often they do that kind of thing get
 
01:45:24.830 --> 01:45:24.840 align:start position:0%
the special people to do it
 
01:45:27.649 --> 01:45:27.659 align:start position:0%
um or other circumstances where we just
 
01:45:30.410 --> 01:45:30.420 align:start position:0%
plainly obvious that a no knock warrant
 
01:45:32.510 --> 01:45:32.520 align:start position:0%
should be uh administered by the police
 
01:45:34.209 --> 01:45:34.219 align:start position:0%
that are there
 
01:45:37.430 --> 01:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
so it is part of the exception
 
01:45:39.950 --> 01:45:39.960 align:start position:0%
um one of the exceptions is if they have
 
01:45:42.290 --> 01:45:42.300 align:start position:0%
a regular search warrant and they arrive
 
01:45:44.090 --> 01:45:44.100 align:start position:0%
and it becomes obvious that a no knock
 
01:45:46.910 --> 01:45:46.920 align:start position:0%
would be necessary this authorizes them
 
01:45:48.590 --> 01:45:48.600 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
01:45:50.570 --> 01:45:50.580 align:start position:0%
and upon doing that they have to make an
 
01:45:52.070 --> 01:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
immediate report to the chief law
 
01:45:53.689 --> 01:45:53.699 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer what they did and
 
01:45:55.370 --> 01:45:55.380 align:start position:0%
why they did it and also has to be
 
01:45:56.870 --> 01:45:56.880 align:start position:0%
notified to the district attorney as
 
01:45:59.450 --> 01:45:59.460 align:start position:0%
well so there are checks and balances in
 
01:46:01.850 --> 01:46:01.860 align:start position:0%
there with regard to the specialized
 
01:46:03.890 --> 01:46:03.900 align:start position:0%
teams they still have to go through the
 
01:46:07.910 --> 01:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:09.550 --> 01:46:09.560 align:start position:0%
maybe I didn't understand your question
 
01:46:11.930 --> 01:46:11.940 align:start position:0%
and I don't blame you for that
 
01:46:11.940 --> 01:46:15.169 align:start position:0%
and I don't blame you for that
[Laughter]

01:46:15.169 --> 01:46:15.179 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:46:17.870 --> 01:46:17.880 align:start position:0%
it was kind of convoluted
 
01:46:21.229 --> 01:46:21.239 align:start position:0%
but but I I guess they they had in that
 
01:46:23.810 --> 01:46:23.820 align:start position:0%
circumstance that you just described
 
01:46:26.090 --> 01:46:26.100 align:start position:0%
they would still have to make a call to
 
01:46:29.629 --> 01:46:29.639 align:start position:0%
at least their chief of police to then
 
01:46:32.330 --> 01:46:32.340 align:start position:0%
execute it at instead of thank you very
 
01:46:34.370 --> 01:46:34.380 align:start position:0%
much actually no I want to correct that
 
01:46:36.350 --> 01:46:36.360 align:start position:0%
no they they don't they they can make
 
01:46:38.450 --> 01:46:38.460 align:start position:0%
the call at the scene themselves and
 
01:46:41.629 --> 01:46:41.639 align:start position:0%
immediately after have to because you're
 
01:46:43.609 --> 01:46:43.619 align:start position:0%
talking about minutes seconds when you
 
01:46:45.410 --> 01:46:45.420 align:start position:0%
get ready to do a door and you see
 
01:46:46.790 --> 01:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
there's someone with a gun you can't
 
01:46:49.370 --> 01:46:49.380 align:start position:0%
pause and make a call and but
 
01:46:51.410 --> 01:46:51.420 align:start position:0%
immediately upon doing it they have to
 
01:46:53.629 --> 01:46:53.639 align:start position:0%
report it thank you
 
01:46:55.430 --> 01:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
representative Stone
 
01:46:58.250 --> 01:46:58.260 align:start position:0%
I just like to follow up uh based on my
 
01:47:00.470 --> 01:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
former occupation I used to carry out uh
 
01:47:02.090 --> 01:47:02.100 align:start position:0%
no knock warrences in addition to
 
01:47:03.830 --> 01:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
regular announcement or knock warrants
 
01:47:06.229 --> 01:47:06.239 align:start position:0%
and there's an operational plan that
 
01:47:07.910 --> 01:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
gets in place before you even execute
 
01:47:08.990 --> 01:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
the warrant your chief of your
 
01:47:11.090 --> 01:47:11.100 align:start position:0%
department I can't think of an agency in
 
01:47:12.050 --> 01:47:12.060 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire where a chief wouldn't
 
01:47:13.850 --> 01:47:13.860 align:start position:0%
know that a search warrant wasn't being
 
01:47:16.370 --> 01:47:16.380 align:start position:0%
executed in his jurisdiction by even an
 
01:47:20.209 --> 01:47:20.219 align:start position:0%
outside agency such as the DEA or ATF so
 
01:47:21.890 --> 01:47:21.900 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of things in place the
 
01:47:23.689 --> 01:47:23.699 align:start position:0%
operational plan obviously calls for
 
01:47:25.970 --> 01:47:25.980 align:start position:0%
additional resources such as EMS on
 
01:47:27.890 --> 01:47:27.900 align:start position:0%
standby and there's quite a checklist
 
01:47:29.570 --> 01:47:29.580 align:start position:0%
that goes down before these warrants are
 
01:47:31.790 --> 01:47:31.800 align:start position:0%
actually carried out and like I said the
 
01:47:34.010 --> 01:47:34.020 align:start position:0%
chiefs of police usually are very aware
 
01:47:35.450 --> 01:47:35.460 align:start position:0%
that this is being conducted prior to
 
01:47:37.550 --> 01:47:37.560 align:start position:0%
the warrant being executed
 
01:47:39.590 --> 01:47:39.600 align:start position:0%
yeah and I would think there would be
 
01:47:41.270 --> 01:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
there'd be something to pay if they
 
01:47:41.280 --> 01:47:42.530 align:start position:0%
there'd be something to pay if they
weren't

01:47:42.530 --> 01:47:42.540 align:start position:0%
weren't
 
01:47:45.109 --> 01:47:45.119 align:start position:0%
um representative Newell
 
01:47:47.149 --> 01:47:47.159 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to clarify and forgive
 
01:47:48.530 --> 01:47:48.540 align:start position:0%
me if this has already been stated but
 
01:47:48.540 --> 01:47:49.790 align:start position:0%
me if this has already been stated but
clearly

01:47:49.790 --> 01:47:49.800 align:start position:0%
clearly
 
01:47:52.010 --> 01:47:52.020 align:start position:0%
um if the situation is that when you get
 
01:47:53.510 --> 01:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
there and you realize that there are
 
01:47:55.790 --> 01:47:55.800 align:start position:0%
exit in certain circumstances
 
01:47:57.290 --> 01:47:57.300 align:start position:0%
um that would create an imminent threat
 
01:47:58.729 --> 01:47:58.739 align:start position:0%
of physical violence to the officer and
 
01:48:01.010 --> 01:48:01.020 align:start position:0%
or another person they would need to
 
01:48:03.950 --> 01:48:03.960 align:start position:0%
immediately notify uh his or her chief
 
01:48:06.830 --> 01:48:06.840 align:start position:0%
law enforcement officer who shall
 
01:48:08.270 --> 01:48:08.280 align:start position:0%
provide written notice to the district
 
01:48:10.010 --> 01:48:10.020 align:start position:0%
attorney so it's notified but it's not
 
01:48:12.290 --> 01:48:12.300 align:start position:0%
necessarily get permission in that
 
01:48:15.229 --> 01:48:15.239 align:start position:0%
moment get authorization but it is the
 
01:48:17.870 --> 01:48:17.880 align:start position:0%
officer making the um the officers
 
01:48:19.550 --> 01:48:19.560 align:start position:0%
discretion and good judgment right
 
01:48:21.950 --> 01:48:21.960 align:start position:0%
notifying and then um obviously that's
 
01:48:25.510 --> 01:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:29.510 --> 01:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
and also um as we know it's not going to
 
01:48:31.609 --> 01:48:31.619 align:start position:0%
be you know too brand new patrolmen out
 
01:48:33.470 --> 01:48:33.480 align:start position:0%
there um you're going to have a senior
 
01:48:35.330 --> 01:48:35.340 align:start position:0%
officer on scene who's in command of one
 
01:48:38.629 --> 01:48:38.639 align:start position:0%
of these teams so um the the Chiefs will
 
01:48:40.250 --> 01:48:40.260 align:start position:0%
certainly have a responsible person
 
01:48:42.649 --> 01:48:42.659 align:start position:0%
there to make this kind of call and the
 
01:48:44.689 --> 01:48:44.699 align:start position:0%
chief will be notified right away and so
 
01:48:47.689 --> 01:48:47.699 align:start position:0%
that will the D.A representative wheeler
 
01:48:49.550 --> 01:48:49.560 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I'm a little concerned that
 
01:48:51.890 --> 01:48:51.900 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't change anything I
 
01:48:53.689 --> 01:48:53.699 align:start position:0%
really agree with representative Rhodes
 
01:48:57.109 --> 01:48:57.119 align:start position:0%
about the uh section including human
 
01:48:59.629 --> 01:48:59.639 align:start position:0%
trafficking and I really want to do
 
01:49:01.430 --> 01:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
everything that we can to get uh to deal
 
01:49:02.629 --> 01:49:02.639 align:start position:0%
with that because that's one of our
 
01:49:05.330 --> 01:49:05.340 align:start position:0%
larger issues that we face today but I'm
 
01:49:07.370 --> 01:49:07.380 align:start position:0%
a little concerned that this is just up
 
01:49:08.810 --> 01:49:08.820 align:start position:0%
to the discretion of the officer and
 
01:49:11.750 --> 01:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
there and thus for they would uh they
 
01:49:14.270 --> 01:49:14.280 align:start position:0%
would have no real record
 
01:49:17.390 --> 01:49:17.400 align:start position:0%
the officer could just say that that uh
 
01:49:20.330 --> 01:49:20.340 align:start position:0%
his safety was at risk and and move
 
01:49:22.850 --> 01:49:22.860 align:start position:0%
forward with the no knock warrant uh and
 
01:49:26.169 --> 01:49:26.179 align:start position:0%
I I I just don't see this as actually
 
01:49:28.669 --> 01:49:28.679 align:start position:0%
addressing what the intent of the bill
 
01:49:31.430 --> 01:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
was which is to to prohibit no knock
 
01:49:34.430 --> 01:49:34.440 align:start position:0%
warrants and uh and I think
 
01:49:36.350 --> 01:49:36.360 align:start position:0%
that there is good reason to do that and
 
01:49:39.350 --> 01:49:39.360 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that um
 
01:49:42.950 --> 01:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
allowing the leeway to uh
 
01:49:45.410 --> 01:49:45.420 align:start position:0%
still pursue one is is the right way to
 
01:49:47.209 --> 01:49:47.219 align:start position:0%
move forward but I'd be interested to
 
01:49:48.229 --> 01:49:48.239 align:start position:0%
hear your response to that yeah
 
01:49:50.149 --> 01:49:50.159 align:start position:0%
absolutely I think when we look at
 
01:49:51.890 --> 01:49:51.900 align:start position:0%
things like this we have to look at um
 
01:49:55.250 --> 01:49:55.260 align:start position:0%
we have to look at the imagine if we
 
01:49:57.770 --> 01:49:57.780 align:start position:0%
didn't so if you can for a moment
 
01:49:59.450 --> 01:49:59.460 align:start position:0%
picture yourself on the scene about the
 
01:50:01.550 --> 01:50:01.560 align:start position:0%
execute a search warrant you're all
 
01:50:03.430 --> 01:50:03.440 align:start position:0%
ready to go it's a knock and announce
 
01:50:06.350 --> 01:50:06.360 align:start position:0%
and you through a window or through
 
01:50:07.910 --> 01:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
whatever intelligence someone on the
 
01:50:09.410 --> 01:50:09.420 align:start position:0%
inside discover
 
01:50:10.550 --> 01:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
um there's a gentleman in there a
 
01:50:14.209 --> 01:50:14.219 align:start position:0%
gentlewoman in there who is armed and is
 
01:50:16.970 --> 01:50:16.980 align:start position:0%
likely to to fire on you when you open
 
01:50:19.189 --> 01:50:19.199 align:start position:0%
the door and announce
 
01:50:21.410 --> 01:50:21.420 align:start position:0%
that that's the only discretion they
 
01:50:23.750 --> 01:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
have is to say oh you know and they have
 
01:50:25.430 --> 01:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
to articulate it they can't just you
 
01:50:27.229 --> 01:50:27.239 align:start position:0%
know like you said well I just I felt
 
01:50:28.910 --> 01:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
unsafe it's going to be a clearly
 
01:50:31.129 --> 01:50:31.139 align:start position:0%
articulable reason so if we go with the
 
01:50:33.050 --> 01:50:33.060 align:start position:0%
what if we didn't they would have to
 
01:50:35.510 --> 01:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
open the door and say police and they're
 
01:50:37.250 --> 01:50:37.260 align:start position:0%
going to get gunfire
 
01:50:39.830 --> 01:50:39.840 align:start position:0%
um I think that the the extremely
 
01:50:43.370 --> 01:50:43.380 align:start position:0%
limited case of allowing that and making
 
01:50:45.290 --> 01:50:45.300 align:start position:0%
them have to explain it in depth to not
 
01:50:46.609 --> 01:50:46.619 align:start position:0%
only their Chief but the district
 
01:50:49.430 --> 01:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
attorney afterwards it gives the public
 
01:50:51.290 --> 01:50:51.300 align:start position:0%
a chance to see what they did and why
 
01:50:54.709 --> 01:50:54.719 align:start position:0%
they did it it's no longer a secret and
 
01:50:57.470 --> 01:50:57.480 align:start position:0%
I think it's the potential the potential
 
01:50:59.270 --> 01:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
for harm is greater if we don't allow
 
01:51:01.609 --> 01:51:01.619 align:start position:0%
that exception that it is if we do and
 
01:51:04.430 --> 01:51:04.440 align:start position:0%
if to your point it becomes apparent
 
01:51:07.910 --> 01:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
that that has been abused we could
 
01:51:07.920 --> 01:51:09.109 align:start position:0%
that that has been abused we could
always

01:51:09.109 --> 01:51:09.119 align:start position:0%
always
 
01:51:11.810 --> 01:51:11.820 align:start position:0%
strike that later based on evidence but
 
01:51:13.609 --> 01:51:13.619 align:start position:0%
right now there's no evidence of that so
 
01:51:15.649 --> 01:51:15.659 align:start position:0%
I don't want to limit that based on no
 
01:51:17.930 --> 01:51:17.940 align:start position:0%
evidence only conjecture I think this
 
01:51:20.530 --> 01:51:20.540 align:start position:0%
does change what's currently going on
 
01:51:23.510 --> 01:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
insofar as even though we hear it's not
 
01:51:26.030 --> 01:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
happening now we have a clear procedure
 
01:51:28.790 --> 01:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
in place when it's authorized and when
 
01:51:32.570 --> 01:51:32.580 align:start position:0%
it's not and also we have now open
 
01:51:34.970 --> 01:51:34.980 align:start position:0%
window for the public to see where as
 
01:51:36.770 --> 01:51:36.780 align:start position:0%
before it was a little more onerous to
 
01:51:39.229 --> 01:51:39.239 align:start position:0%
get these documents now
 
01:51:40.970 --> 01:51:40.980 align:start position:0%
they become public right away after
 
01:51:42.410 --> 01:51:42.420 align:start position:0%
they're done
 
01:51:44.810 --> 01:51:44.820 align:start position:0%
follow-up Mr chairman absolutely I
 
01:51:47.450 --> 01:51:47.460 align:start position:0%
really appreciate that um
 
01:51:47.460 --> 01:51:49.189 align:start position:0%
really appreciate that um
and

01:51:49.189 --> 01:51:49.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:51:52.430 --> 01:51:52.440 align:start position:0%
hear your side of I think Mr chairman
 
01:51:53.750 --> 01:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
based on the fact that you likely have
 
01:51:55.070 --> 01:51:55.080 align:start position:0%
the votes on this amendment I'm probably
 
01:51:57.290 --> 01:51:57.300 align:start position:0%
going to vote against it I I I was
 
01:51:59.689 --> 01:51:59.699 align:start position:0%
someone who I remember very clearly the
 
01:52:01.310 --> 01:52:01.320 align:start position:0%
no-nog Warren that I went through as a
 
01:52:05.270 --> 01:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
child and uh I I just think the practice
 
01:52:08.810 --> 01:52:08.820 align:start position:0%
itself is so flawed that
 
01:52:12.169 --> 01:52:12.179 align:start position:0%
allowing the leeway to to continue that
 
01:52:14.450 --> 01:52:14.460 align:start position:0%
practice in any way whatsoever I just
 
01:52:15.649 --> 01:52:15.659 align:start position:0%
want to go back to the time when it
 
01:52:17.450 --> 01:52:17.460 align:start position:0%
wasn't even legal and I think that
 
01:52:19.189 --> 01:52:19.199 align:start position:0%
that's what the original Bill does so
 
01:52:21.410 --> 01:52:21.420 align:start position:0%
given that you have the votes
 
01:52:22.790 --> 01:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
um I think on principle I'll probably
 
01:52:25.370 --> 01:52:25.380 align:start position:0%
vote against your Amendment with respect
 
01:52:27.050 --> 01:52:27.060 align:start position:0%
um no offense taken and that's why we're
 
01:52:29.750 --> 01:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
here to discuss and I appreciate your
 
01:52:31.129 --> 01:52:31.139 align:start position:0%
experience brought to share with the
 
01:52:32.990 --> 01:52:33.000 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
01:52:34.910 --> 01:52:34.920 align:start position:0%
so I know I'm only on the fire side
 
01:52:37.850 --> 01:52:37.860 align:start position:0%
right I'm a deputy chief and I know if I
 
01:52:39.109 --> 01:52:39.119 align:start position:0%
have people under me that aren't
 
01:52:41.689 --> 01:52:41.699 align:start position:0%
following the rules God help them right
 
01:52:43.310 --> 01:52:43.320 align:start position:0%
because it's almost
 
01:52:47.450 --> 01:52:47.460 align:start position:0%
more wrath than what the other law would
 
01:52:49.129 --> 01:52:49.139 align:start position:0%
do for you
 
01:52:51.470 --> 01:52:51.480 align:start position:0%
um and I'd like to hear how you would
 
01:52:55.790 --> 01:52:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:58.310 --> 01:52:58.320 align:start position:0%
well I'm not a law enforcement officer
 
01:53:01.810 --> 01:53:01.820 align:start position:0%
representative and I I don't uh claim to
 
01:53:05.330 --> 01:53:05.340 align:start position:0%
no law enforcement strategy but
 
01:53:05.340 --> 01:53:06.109 align:start position:0%
no law enforcement strategy but
um

01:53:06.109 --> 01:53:06.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:08.450 --> 01:53:08.460 align:start position:0%
frankly I do agree with what was brought
 
01:53:09.950 --> 01:53:09.960 align:start position:0%
up in public testimony and the questions
 
01:53:12.290 --> 01:53:12.300 align:start position:0%
I think that there are other ways to
 
01:53:13.910 --> 01:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
arrest the person it doesn't have to be
 
01:53:15.410 --> 01:53:15.420 align:start position:0%
when the person's in the house I think
 
01:53:18.169 --> 01:53:18.179 align:start position:0%
very few human beings are all the time
 
01:53:21.290 --> 01:53:21.300 align:start position:0%
100 in their house and law enforcement
 
01:53:24.649 --> 01:53:24.659 align:start position:0%
could through the Myriad of surveillance
 
01:53:27.350 --> 01:53:27.360 align:start position:0%
technology we have right now find that
 
01:53:28.609 --> 01:53:28.619 align:start position:0%
person when they're outside of their
 
01:53:30.830 --> 01:53:30.840 align:start position:0%
house and arrest them then
 
01:53:32.629 --> 01:53:32.639 align:start position:0%
um and of course if that person has
 
01:53:35.990 --> 01:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
committed a provable haramis a heinous
 
01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:37.070 align:start position:0%
committed a provable haramis a heinous
crime

01:53:37.070 --> 01:53:37.080 align:start position:0%
crime
 
01:53:40.370 --> 01:53:40.380 align:start position:0%
um that uh their house could be searched
 
01:53:42.350 --> 01:53:42.360 align:start position:0%
and seized after that person has been
 
01:53:44.590 --> 01:53:44.600 align:start position:0%
arrested on the street
 
01:53:48.470 --> 01:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
thank you um happy to do it I actually I
 
01:53:49.669 --> 01:53:49.679 align:start position:0%
appreciate the I appreciate the
 
01:53:52.250 --> 01:53:52.260 align:start position:0%
discussion and I um recognize your
 
01:53:54.590 --> 01:53:54.600 align:start position:0%
position representative wheeler I think
 
01:53:56.570 --> 01:53:56.580 align:start position:0%
um I'm happy that you added to the uh to
 
01:53:58.010 --> 01:53:58.020 align:start position:0%
the discussion
 
01:53:59.390 --> 01:53:59.400 align:start position:0%
um but having said that I think we've
 
01:54:01.129 --> 01:54:01.139 align:start position:0%
discussed this quite enough I think that
 
01:54:03.050 --> 01:54:03.060 align:start position:0%
we all know our positions on it and I
 
01:54:05.750 --> 01:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
hope that um I hope that the majority of
 
01:54:08.870 --> 01:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
the committee adopts the amendment and I
 
01:54:10.189 --> 01:54:10.199 align:start position:0%
think that's where we are right we're
 
01:54:12.590 --> 01:54:12.600 align:start position:0%
yeah okay I'll ask the court to call the

CE yes motion passes 19-1
 
01:56:41.030 --> 01:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
representative Murray would you object
 
01:56:43.790 --> 01:56:43.800 align:start position:0%
to consent I do not thank you there
 
01:56:45.050 --> 01:56:45.060 align:start position:0%
being no objection this will go on
 
01:56:49.010 --> 01:56:49.020 align:start position:0%
consent and the bill passes out to pass
 
01:56:51.950 --> 01:56:51.960 align:start position:0%
with that I will open what's the last
 
01:56:53.030 --> 01:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
one we have
 
01:56:55.189 --> 01:56:55.199 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry Mr chairman I was not paying
 
01:56:56.750 --> 01:56:56.760 align:start position:0%
attention I objected to this being on
 
01:56:58.669 --> 01:56:58.679 align:start position:0%
consent if it's still possible but you
 
01:57:05.169 --> 01:57:05.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:07.669 --> 01:57:07.679 align:start position:0%
objected to it do you want to reconsider
 
01:57:10.370 --> 01:57:10.380 align:start position:0%
your vote if I could
 
01:57:13.189 --> 01:57:13.199 align:start position:0%
but Alec Ali could just also object to
 
01:57:15.290 --> 01:57:15.300 align:start position:0%
it being on consent as well okay with
 
01:57:16.729 --> 01:57:16.739 align:start position:0%
the procedure
 
01:57:18.410 --> 01:57:18.420 align:start position:0%
and that'll just save you from having to
 
01:57:20.390 --> 01:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
pull it after so yeah okay it will not
 
01:57:21.589 --> 01:57:21.599 align:start position:0%
go in consent
 
01:57:23.930 --> 01:57:23.940 align:start position:0%
and representative wheeler will write
 
01:57:27.109 --> 01:57:27.119 align:start position:0%
the minority reports and see are you
 
01:57:29.390 --> 01:57:29.400 align:start position:0%

01:57:29.400 --> 01:57:30.709 align:start position:0%

so moving on what's
 
01:57:39.109 --> 01:57:39.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:39.119 --> 01:57:46.189 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:57:46.189 --> 01:57:46.199 align:start position:0%

what's left yeah 156. I opened the
 
01:57:52.370 --> 01:57:52.380 align:start position:0%
executive session on House Bill 156.

Mr chairman I move Amendment
 
01:58:06.229 --> 01:58:06.239 align:start position:0%
202308 I'm sorry zero six eight two
 
01:58:12.649 --> 01:58:12.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:14.689 --> 01:58:14.699 align:start position:0%
Ed by representative Muse representative
 
01:58:15.709 --> 01:58:15.719 align:start position:0%
Jan would you like to speak to your
 
01:58:17.149 --> 01:58:17.159 align:start position:0%
emotional in the amendment
 
01:58:19.490 --> 01:58:19.500 align:start position:0%
yes uh the Amendments before you would
 
01:58:19.500 --> 01:58:20.930 align:start position:0%
yes uh the Amendments before you would
actually

01:58:20.930 --> 01:58:20.940 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:58:20.940 --> 01:58:21.530 align:start position:0%
actually
um

01:58:21.530 --> 01:58:21.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:21.540 --> 01:58:23.050 align:start position:0%
um
changes

01:58:23.050 --> 01:58:23.060 align:start position:0%
changes
 
01:58:26.089 --> 01:58:26.099 align:start position:0%
uh section one of the bill
 
01:58:30.350 --> 01:58:30.360 align:start position:0%
and what it changes is it makes
 
01:58:30.360 --> 01:58:32.570 align:start position:0%
and what it changes is it makes
misconduct

01:58:32.570 --> 01:58:32.580 align:start position:0%
misconduct
 
01:58:35.890 --> 01:58:35.900 align:start position:0%
could be described as intentional
 
01:58:38.930 --> 01:58:38.940 align:start position:0%
misrepresentation of a material fact and
 
01:58:41.149 --> 01:58:41.159 align:start position:0%
the police report as described in RSC
 
01:58:44.930 --> 01:58:44.940 align:start position:0%
641 colon 3. 641 colon 3 is unsworn
 
01:58:49.790 --> 01:58:49.800 align:start position:0%
falsification statute and it defines
 
01:58:54.169 --> 01:58:54.179 align:start position:0%
this very well so I think that removing
 
01:58:56.689 --> 01:58:56.699 align:start position:0%
what was in the original Bill and
 
01:58:59.229 --> 01:58:59.239 align:start position:0%
replacing it with this still
 
01:59:02.209 --> 01:59:02.219 align:start position:0%
encapsulates most of what was in the
 
01:59:04.370 --> 01:59:04.380 align:start position:0%
original bill but it just cleans up the
 
01:59:06.050 --> 01:59:06.060 align:start position:0%
the language and makes it a little bit
 
01:59:08.270 --> 01:59:08.280 align:start position:0%
easier to understand
 
01:59:09.709 --> 01:59:09.719 align:start position:0%
representative Muse would you like to
 
01:59:11.629 --> 01:59:11.639 align:start position:0%
speak to your second
 
01:59:13.970 --> 01:59:13.980 align:start position:0%
yes I I think uh I think that the
 
01:59:16.550 --> 01:59:16.560 align:start position:0%
amendment actually does capture uh the
 
01:59:19.189 --> 01:59:19.199 align:start position:0%
intent of of my original bill
 
01:59:20.810 --> 01:59:20.820 align:start position:0%
um the part that that actually is
 
01:59:24.830 --> 01:59:24.840 align:start position:0%
missing is uh specifically calling out
 
01:59:27.830 --> 01:59:27.840 align:start position:0%
um a misidentification of a person but
 
01:59:30.169 --> 01:59:30.179 align:start position:0%
um if you take a look at the statute uh
 
01:59:32.450 --> 01:59:32.460 align:start position:0%
intentional misidentification of
 
01:59:36.410 --> 01:59:36.420 align:start position:0%
somebody's ethnicity gender or race uh
 
01:59:38.510 --> 01:59:38.520 align:start position:0%
would actually be covered under under
 
01:59:41.570 --> 01:59:41.580 align:start position:0%
the statute so what we're we're in
 
01:59:45.770 --> 01:59:45.780 align:start position:0%
effect doing is really elevating the uh
 
01:59:49.250 --> 01:59:49.260 align:start position:0%
the uh intentional misrepresentation of
 
01:59:52.910 --> 01:59:52.920 align:start position:0%
a material effect in a case to a form of
 
01:59:54.589 --> 01:59:54.599 align:start position:0%
misconduct and we're we're actually
 
01:59:58.010 --> 01:59:58.020 align:start position:0%
including that in the definition and
 
02:00:01.729 --> 02:00:01.739 align:start position:0%
what that will effectively do is uh for
 
02:00:04.490 --> 02:00:04.500 align:start position:0%
uh for police officers who are charged
 
02:00:07.129 --> 02:00:07.139 align:start position:0%
with that and who go through the process
 
02:00:09.109 --> 02:00:09.119 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that uh that that
 
02:00:11.830 --> 02:00:11.840 align:start position:0%
will do will it will make it a
 
02:00:15.470 --> 02:00:15.480 align:start position:0%
it'll make it a uh the kind of an
 
02:00:15.480 --> 02:00:18.350 align:start position:0%
it'll make it a uh the kind of an
offense

02:00:18.350 --> 02:00:18.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:20.390 --> 02:00:20.400 align:start position:0%
sorry about that it will make it the uh
 
02:00:22.570 --> 02:00:22.580 align:start position:0%
it will make it the kind of offense
 
02:00:25.129 --> 02:00:25.139 align:start position:0%
that could lead to a suspension of
 
02:00:27.830 --> 02:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
certification or certificate or loss of
 
02:00:31.010 --> 02:00:31.020 align:start position:0%
Certification depending on on the
 
02:00:33.589 --> 02:00:33.599 align:start position:0%
severity of the issue and on on what's
 
02:00:35.169 --> 02:00:35.179 align:start position:0%
found so
 
02:00:39.530 --> 02:00:39.540 align:start position:0%
I I think the this this bill was
 
02:00:41.810 --> 02:00:41.820 align:start position:0%
actually intended to to address a very
 
02:00:43.729 --> 02:00:43.739 align:start position:0%
serious issue and I and I don't think it
 
02:00:46.430 --> 02:00:46.440 align:start position:0%
will affect 99.9 percent of law
 
02:00:49.010 --> 02:00:49.020 align:start position:0%
enforcement officers uh but for that
 
02:00:51.169 --> 02:00:51.179 align:start position:0%
point one percent uh who might be
 
02:00:52.729 --> 02:00:52.739 align:start position:0%
thinking about doing something like this
 
02:00:55.370 --> 02:00:55.380 align:start position:0%
it sends a pretty strong message
 
02:00:57.290 --> 02:00:57.300 align:start position:0%
um that we take this seriously in New
 
02:00:57.300 --> 02:00:58.310 align:start position:0%
um that we take this seriously in New
Hampshire

02:00:58.310 --> 02:00:58.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
02:01:01.129 --> 02:01:01.139 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative uh
 
02:01:03.830 --> 02:01:03.840 align:start position:0%
janvin and Muse for that
 
02:01:06.589 --> 02:01:06.599 align:start position:0%
um I always take extremely seriously any
 
02:01:12.050 --> 02:01:12.060 align:start position:0%
bill that would in uh anyway Target
 
02:01:16.070 --> 02:01:16.080 align:start position:0%
the people that we charge with enforcing
 
02:01:17.510 --> 02:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
the laws that we make
 
02:01:19.609 --> 02:01:19.619 align:start position:0%
having said that
 
02:01:21.530 --> 02:01:21.540 align:start position:0%
I believe that there's not a chief of
 
02:01:23.390 --> 02:01:23.400 align:start position:0%
police in this state who would not take
 
02:01:25.129 --> 02:01:25.139 align:start position:0%
disciplinary action against one of his
 
02:01:28.010 --> 02:01:28.020 align:start position:0%
or her officers for an intentional
 
02:01:30.709 --> 02:01:30.719 align:start position:0%
misrepresentation of fact in any report
 
02:01:33.649 --> 02:01:33.659 align:start position:0%
or document so I think this is again
 
02:01:35.510 --> 02:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
just a case of codifying something that
 
02:01:39.050 --> 02:01:39.060 align:start position:0%
is already being done and um and and it
 
02:01:41.930 --> 02:01:41.940 align:start position:0%
sends to your point a good message
 
02:01:44.870 --> 02:01:44.880 align:start position:0%

02:04:05.510 --> 02:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
and I close the public hearing on House
 
02:04:07.729 --> 02:04:07.739 align:start position:0%
Bill 156.
 
02:04:07.739 --> 02:04:08.810 align:start position:0%
Bill 156.
what

02:04:08.810 --> 02:04:08.820 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:04:12.169 --> 02:04:12.179 align:start position:0%
uh excuse me executive session I'm 156.
 
02:04:14.209 --> 02:04:14.219 align:start position:0%
um with that I will open the executive
 
02:04:15.950 --> 02:04:15.960 align:start position:0%
session on
 
02:04:19.189 --> 02:04:19.199 align:start position:0%
House Bill 593
 
02:04:21.470 --> 02:04:21.480 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to recognize myself to
 
02:04:23.030 --> 02:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
make a motion
 
02:04:25.729 --> 02:04:25.739 align:start position:0%
I had hoped to have a conversation with
 
02:04:28.010 --> 02:04:28.020 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor of the spill I have
 
02:04:29.810 --> 02:04:29.820 align:start position:0%
not seen him this morning
 
02:04:31.550 --> 02:04:31.560 align:start position:0%
having said that
 
02:04:35.209 --> 02:04:35.219 align:start position:0%
um this spill is a very complicated bill
 
02:04:37.970 --> 02:04:37.980 align:start position:0%
um and it certainly deserves more than
 
02:04:40.370 --> 02:04:40.380 align:start position:0%
the week of time we've had to digest it
 
02:04:44.270 --> 02:04:44.280 align:start position:0%
there is a lot of a lot of work needs to
 
02:04:46.490 --> 02:04:46.500 align:start position:0%
be done with the court system with the
 
02:04:48.410 --> 02:04:48.420 align:start position:0%
police with the sponsor
 
02:04:51.609 --> 02:04:51.619 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to move to retain this bill
 
02:04:54.709 --> 02:04:54.719 align:start position:0%
to give it a chance to be worked out so
 
02:04:57.470 --> 02:04:57.480 align:start position:0%
that we can hopefully get buy-in from
 
02:05:00.050 --> 02:05:00.060 align:start position:0%
everyone who this would affect rather
 
02:05:02.870 --> 02:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
than just pass it or kill it that's the
 
02:05:04.669 --> 02:05:04.679 align:start position:0%
chairman no second emotion thank you I
 
02:05:06.169 --> 02:05:06.179 align:start position:0%
appreciate that I should have asked for
 
02:05:08.629 --> 02:05:08.639 align:start position:0%
that first but the retroactive second is
 
02:05:08.639 --> 02:05:09.950 align:start position:0%
that first but the retroactive second is
appreciated

02:05:09.950 --> 02:05:09.960 align:start position:0%
appreciated
 
02:05:11.510 --> 02:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
um so with that I would open it up to
 
02:05:13.490 --> 02:05:13.500 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
02:05:16.550 --> 02:05:16.560 align:start position:0%
representative Murray thank you Mr chair
 
02:05:17.810 --> 02:05:17.820 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to make sure that the
 
02:05:20.330 --> 02:05:20.340 align:start position:0%
committee was aware of two amendments
 
02:05:22.550 --> 02:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
that were offered to us by the sponsors
 
02:05:24.709 --> 02:05:24.719 align:start position:0%
of this legislation that I'm happy to
 
02:05:25.729 --> 02:05:25.739 align:start position:0%
move forward to the rest of the
 
02:05:28.010 --> 02:05:28.020 align:start position:0%
committee and also the co-sponsor of
 
02:05:29.510 --> 02:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
this bill is in the room right now if we
 
02:05:31.910 --> 02:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
do have any further questions
 
02:05:33.950 --> 02:05:33.960 align:start position:0%
thank you and I think that underscores
 
02:05:35.870 --> 02:05:35.880 align:start position:0%
my point I I haven't seen the Amendments
 
02:05:38.030 --> 02:05:38.040 align:start position:0%
I think this is a this is a complicated
 
02:05:39.950 --> 02:05:39.960 align:start position:0%
Bill and um I think it's going to
 
02:05:41.990 --> 02:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
require a full committee uh work session
 
02:05:43.910 --> 02:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
I know there was a subcommittee to look
 
02:05:46.430 --> 02:05:46.440 align:start position:0%
at it and frankly I don't know that they
 
02:05:48.050 --> 02:05:48.060 align:start position:0%
were able to make enough Headway that we
 
02:05:49.790 --> 02:05:49.800 align:start position:0%
can clearly understand the the
 
02:05:51.530 --> 02:05:51.540 align:start position:0%
implications of what it will do in the
 
02:05:51.540 --> 02:05:52.790 align:start position:0%
implications of what it will do in the
court

02:05:52.790 --> 02:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
court
 
02:05:54.589 --> 02:05:54.599 align:start position:0%
um I don't think was quite on board yet
 
02:05:57.169 --> 02:05:57.179 align:start position:0%
a representative Rhodes thank you Mr
 
02:05:57.179 --> 02:05:58.129 align:start position:0%
a representative Rhodes thank you Mr
chairman

02:05:58.129 --> 02:05:58.139 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
02:05:59.330 --> 02:05:59.340 align:start position:0%
um I'd just like to reiterate what you
 
02:06:00.770 --> 02:06:00.780 align:start position:0%
just said we did have the subcommittee
 
02:06:04.010 --> 02:06:04.020 align:start position:0%
uh meeting on this and the subcommittee
 
02:06:06.890 --> 02:06:06.900 align:start position:0%
did unanimously vote to retain it pretty
 
02:06:09.169 --> 02:06:09.179 align:start position:0%
much for all the reasons that you just
 
02:06:11.870 --> 02:06:11.880 align:start position:0%
said and it is very hard for me to sit
 
02:06:14.629 --> 02:06:14.639 align:start position:0%
in the criminal justice committee
 
02:06:18.290 --> 02:06:18.300 align:start position:0%
and make this kind of a vote when quite
 
02:06:20.149 --> 02:06:20.159 align:start position:0%
frankly I I feel like I'm out of my
 
02:06:22.370 --> 02:06:22.380 align:start position:0%
league and I don't think that's fair to
 
02:06:24.050 --> 02:06:24.060 align:start position:0%
the sponsors or anybody else that it
 
02:06:26.330 --> 02:06:26.340 align:start position:0%
would involve so you know what would
 
02:06:28.729 --> 02:06:28.739 align:start position:0%
happen to it after it's retained I don't
 
02:06:30.530 --> 02:06:30.540 align:start position:0%
know if representative Lynn would be
 
02:06:32.990 --> 02:06:33.000 align:start position:0%
better in his committee but I definitely
 
02:06:35.330 --> 02:06:35.340 align:start position:0%
feel like I was I feel like a fish out
 
02:06:37.250 --> 02:06:37.260 align:start position:0%
of water to be quite Frank
 
02:06:40.490 --> 02:06:40.500 align:start position:0%
thank you um I think that that applies
 
02:06:43.370 --> 02:06:43.380 align:start position:0%
to anyone who read the bill it is
 
02:06:45.229 --> 02:06:45.239 align:start position:0%
complicated and we will work probably
 
02:06:47.209 --> 02:06:47.219 align:start position:0%
with traditional I don't I don't think
 
02:06:50.570 --> 02:06:50.580 align:start position:0%
that at this point there's any advantage
 
02:06:52.129 --> 02:06:52.139 align:start position:0%
to try and move it over to judicial
 
02:06:53.810 --> 02:06:53.820 align:start position:0%
we'll just work with them at the same
 
02:06:55.910 --> 02:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
time and see representative Lynn would
 
02:06:57.649 --> 02:06:57.659 align:start position:0%
you like to speak to that yes and thank
 
02:07:00.709 --> 02:07:00.719 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um I uh I I agree I'm going
 
02:07:02.689 --> 02:07:02.699 align:start position:0%
to vote for the retention because I
 
02:07:05.089 --> 02:07:05.099 align:start position:0%
think the points you make are are valid
 
02:07:05.099 --> 02:07:06.169 align:start position:0%
think the points you make are are valid
ones

02:07:06.169 --> 02:07:06.179 align:start position:0%
ones
 
02:07:11.209 --> 02:07:11.219 align:start position:0%
um there's uh not in in no way the fault
 
02:07:13.550 --> 02:07:13.560 align:start position:0%
of of this committee I think we we had
 
02:07:16.070 --> 02:07:16.080 align:start position:0%
some we had some bumps in the road as we
 
02:07:18.229 --> 02:07:18.239 align:start position:0%
were as we were kind of working in a
 
02:07:20.750 --> 02:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
group to getting this together
 
02:07:23.510 --> 02:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
um and I'm you know how that happens is
 
02:07:25.370 --> 02:07:25.380 align:start position:0%
I'll is not really particularly
 
02:07:27.350 --> 02:07:27.360 align:start position:0%
important but I do think that there are
 
02:07:29.689 --> 02:07:29.699 align:start position:0%
are things that um
 
02:07:31.669 --> 02:07:31.679 align:start position:0%
that we need to confront and I'll just
 
02:07:33.950 --> 02:07:33.960 align:start position:0%
give an example uh Chief profansky who I
 
02:07:36.530 --> 02:07:36.540 align:start position:0%
know is in the room now raised a what it
 
02:07:37.970 --> 02:07:37.980 align:start position:0%
seems to me to be a very legitimate
 
02:07:37.980 --> 02:07:38.750 align:start position:0%
seems to me to be a very legitimate
point

02:07:38.750 --> 02:07:38.760 align:start position:0%
point
 
02:07:42.649 --> 02:07:42.659 align:start position:0%
he indicated that he read the bill
 
02:07:45.470 --> 02:07:45.480 align:start position:0%
the the part that um
 
02:07:48.530 --> 02:07:48.540 align:start position:0%
deals with uh uh what's been referred to
 
02:07:50.930 --> 02:07:50.940 align:start position:0%
as adoptive forfeitures
 
02:07:54.169 --> 02:07:54.179 align:start position:0%
that he read the bill to mean that if we
 
02:07:56.169 --> 02:07:56.179 align:start position:0%
were to pass the bill
 
02:07:58.370 --> 02:07:58.380 align:start position:0%
that the
 
02:08:01.010 --> 02:08:01.020 align:start position:0%
if there was a situation of a local law
 
02:08:03.649 --> 02:08:03.659 align:start position:0%
enforcement agency that without any
 
02:08:05.510 --> 02:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
federal assistance
 
02:08:08.890 --> 02:08:08.900 align:start position:0%
made a drug arrest let's say
 
02:08:10.689 --> 02:08:10.699 align:start position:0%
and then
 
02:08:13.250 --> 02:08:13.260 align:start position:0%
decided and presumably this would be
 
02:08:14.570 --> 02:08:14.580 align:start position:0%
because it turned out that they got
 
02:08:15.950 --> 02:08:15.960 align:start position:0%
there were a lot more drugs there than
 
02:08:18.709 --> 02:08:18.719 align:start position:0%
they anticipated or some other Factor
 
02:08:20.330 --> 02:08:20.340 align:start position:0%
at any rate
 
02:08:22.550 --> 02:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
they made the original initial arrest on
 
02:08:24.770 --> 02:08:24.780 align:start position:0%
their own and then they decide after
 
02:08:27.649 --> 02:08:27.659 align:start position:0%
that to refer the matter to the federal
 
02:08:30.410 --> 02:08:30.420 align:start position:0%
government not just for a forfeiture but
 
02:08:32.750 --> 02:08:32.760 align:start position:0%
for federal prosecution
 
02:08:36.109 --> 02:08:36.119 align:start position:0%
he indicated he he read the bill to say
 
02:08:39.229 --> 02:08:39.239 align:start position:0%
that even in that circumstance where the
 
02:08:42.890 --> 02:08:42.900 align:start position:0%
whole case including the prosecution and
 
02:08:44.870 --> 02:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
the seizure were referred to the federal
 
02:08:47.330 --> 02:08:47.340 align:start position:0%
government the state would not the state
 
02:08:49.490 --> 02:08:49.500 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to do that he in other
 
02:08:52.490 --> 02:08:52.500 align:start position:0%
words and and I certainly had never
 
02:08:52.500 --> 02:08:53.689 align:start position:0%
words and and I certainly had never
intended

02:08:53.689 --> 02:08:53.699 align:start position:0%
intended
 
02:08:55.970 --> 02:08:55.980 align:start position:0%
I did I don't think I had read the bill
 
02:08:59.930 --> 02:08:59.940 align:start position:0%
that way but but the fact that he has a
 
02:09:02.089 --> 02:09:02.099 align:start position:0%
you know a different view of it means
 
02:09:03.229 --> 02:09:03.239 align:start position:0%
that we at least need to think about
 
02:09:04.790 --> 02:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
that maybe we need to put some language
 
02:09:07.609 --> 02:09:07.619 align:start position:0%
in because I certainly I mean I I can
 
02:09:09.350 --> 02:09:09.360 align:start position:0%
remember from my days as a prosecutor
 
02:09:12.530 --> 02:09:12.540 align:start position:0%
that it was not at all uncommon
 
02:09:15.770 --> 02:09:15.780 align:start position:0%
um for us at the in the U.S attorney's
 
02:09:18.770 --> 02:09:18.780 align:start position:0%
Office to take a case that the state
 
02:09:22.129 --> 02:09:22.139 align:start position:0%
referred to us uh where the where DEA or
 
02:09:24.470 --> 02:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
the FED ATF the feds had no involvement
 
02:09:27.850 --> 02:09:27.860 align:start position:0%
prior uh to to the case being referred
 
02:09:29.990 --> 02:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
but then to take it for federal
 
02:09:33.050 --> 02:09:33.060 align:start position:0%
prosecution and and I certainly would
 
02:09:34.370 --> 02:09:34.380 align:start position:0%
not want to do anything that would
 
02:09:36.229 --> 02:09:36.239 align:start position:0%
prohibit that because I think that
 
02:09:39.410 --> 02:09:39.420 align:start position:0%
happens with some regularity and should
 
02:09:41.570 --> 02:09:41.580 align:start position:0%
be allowed to continue to happen what
 
02:09:44.209 --> 02:09:44.219 align:start position:0%
what I think
 
02:09:44.219 --> 02:09:45.229 align:start position:0%
what I think
um

02:09:45.229 --> 02:09:45.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:47.450 --> 02:09:47.460 align:start position:0%
the my intent anyway and I think their
 
02:09:49.129 --> 02:09:49.139 align:start position:0%
intent of the other people that
 
02:09:51.290 --> 02:09:51.300 align:start position:0%
sponsored this was to prevent the
 
02:09:51.300 --> 02:09:52.490 align:start position:0%
sponsored this was to prevent the
situation

02:09:52.490 --> 02:09:52.500 align:start position:0%
situation
 
02:09:57.649 --> 02:09:57.659 align:start position:0%
of a case that is a holy State case it's
 
02:10:01.010 --> 02:10:01.020 align:start position:0%
prosecuted in State Court there's no
 
02:10:04.729 --> 02:10:04.739 align:start position:0%
um uh that there's no involvement of the
 
02:10:07.189 --> 02:10:07.199 align:start position:0%
feds in the actual criminal prosecution
 
02:10:10.010 --> 02:10:10.020 align:start position:0%
of the defendant but then the forfeiture
 
02:10:13.910 --> 02:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
is simply referred to the to the uh the
 
02:10:16.370 --> 02:10:16.380 align:start position:0%
federal government now I know I I from
 
02:10:17.629 --> 02:10:17.639 align:start position:0%
again from my discussion with Chief
 
02:10:19.550 --> 02:10:19.560 align:start position:0%
proflonski it may be that law
 
02:10:22.370 --> 02:10:22.380 align:start position:0%
enforcement doesn't objects to even that
 
02:10:24.350 --> 02:10:24.360 align:start position:0%
being prohibited and if that's the case
 
02:10:25.970 --> 02:10:25.980 align:start position:0%
I have to say I do disagree with them on
 
02:10:28.250 --> 02:10:28.260 align:start position:0%
that I don't I do think that there's a
 
02:10:32.149 --> 02:10:32.159 align:start position:0%
genuine reason to prohibit the a case
 
02:10:35.270 --> 02:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
where there's simply local involvement
 
02:10:37.910 --> 02:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
um in the in the prosecution to then
 
02:10:40.310 --> 02:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
then refer that to the feds for the
 
02:10:42.950 --> 02:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
forfeiture only I I do think that that's
 
02:10:45.530 --> 02:10:45.540 align:start position:0%
that there's a reason to prohibit that
 
02:10:46.850 --> 02:10:46.860 align:start position:0%
um but that the very fact that we're
 
02:10:48.530 --> 02:10:48.540 align:start position:0%
having you know I I'm sort of giving you
 
02:10:51.589 --> 02:10:51.599 align:start position:0%
this explanation suggests that we that
 
02:10:53.450 --> 02:10:53.460 align:start position:0%
we need to do some more work on this
 
02:10:56.030 --> 02:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
bill so that we make sure we
 
02:10:58.609 --> 02:10:58.619 align:start position:0%
um we're we're all sort of on the same
 
02:11:00.470 --> 02:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
page and to the extent that retention
 
02:11:02.629 --> 02:11:02.639 align:start position:0%
will allow us to get there
 
02:11:05.570 --> 02:11:05.580 align:start position:0%
um I I can certainly support that
 
02:11:08.629 --> 02:11:08.639 align:start position:0%
thank you and coming from the former
 
02:11:10.669 --> 02:11:10.679 align:start position:0%
Chief Justice of the state supreme court
 
02:11:12.890 --> 02:11:12.900 align:start position:0%
I'm thoroughly confused now so that's
 
02:11:12.900 --> 02:11:13.689 align:start position:0%
I'm thoroughly confused now so that's
good

02:11:13.689 --> 02:11:13.699 align:start position:0%
good
 
02:11:17.330 --> 02:11:17.340 align:start position:0%
that that we I think we definitely we
 
02:11:19.310 --> 02:11:19.320 align:start position:0%
definitely need to retain this bill
 
02:11:21.649 --> 02:11:21.659 align:start position:0%
um any further discussion representative
 
02:11:23.629 --> 02:11:23.639 align:start position:0%
I would just like to find out if you
 
02:11:25.850 --> 02:11:25.860 align:start position:0%
have you is that a retention would allow
 
02:11:29.149 --> 02:11:29.159 align:start position:0%
this bill to be worked on by the
 
02:11:31.430 --> 02:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate people to come together with
 
02:11:33.290 --> 02:11:33.300 align:start position:0%
the appropriate outcome that is
 
02:11:36.530 --> 02:11:36.540 align:start position:0%
absolutely my intention I plan on making
 
02:11:39.050 --> 02:11:39.060 align:start position:0%
sure everyone at the table understands
 
02:11:42.229 --> 02:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
this and has at least some type of an
 
02:11:44.450 --> 02:11:44.460 align:start position:0%
agreement on how it should proceed and I
 
02:11:46.370 --> 02:11:46.380 align:start position:0%
think that was a more concise question
 
02:11:48.649 --> 02:11:48.659 align:start position:0%
it was actually very good and I I would
 
02:11:50.629 --> 02:11:50.639 align:start position:0%
say to the extent of you know Judiciary
 
02:11:52.850 --> 02:11:52.860 align:start position:0%
we're happy to work with you on this I
 
02:11:54.169 --> 02:11:54.179 align:start position:0%
have no problem and I'm sure
 
02:11:57.290 --> 02:11:57.300 align:start position:0%
representative uh uh Papa Richie Muller
 
02:11:58.490 --> 02:11:58.500 align:start position:0%
would all who's here would also be
 
02:12:02.089 --> 02:12:02.099 align:start position:0%
willing to work with us uh uh on that as
 
02:12:03.950 --> 02:12:03.960 align:start position:0%
well as representative McGuire
 
02:12:05.689 --> 02:12:05.699 align:start position:0%
um I that is good to know because we
 
02:12:07.550 --> 02:12:07.560 align:start position:0%
will definitely be using that resource
 
02:12:09.229 --> 02:12:09.239 align:start position:0%
representative jambrian
 
02:12:11.990 --> 02:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh as most of you
 
02:12:15.050 --> 02:12:15.060 align:start position:0%
would recall uh
 
02:12:17.030 --> 02:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
before I took a break from the house I
 
02:12:18.589 --> 02:12:18.599 align:start position:0%
actually served on Judiciary Committee
 
02:12:21.229 --> 02:12:21.239 align:start position:0%
for four years and in those four years a
 
02:12:23.589 --> 02:12:23.599 align:start position:0%
bill similar to this came to us twice
 
02:12:27.050 --> 02:12:27.060 align:start position:0%
and my recollection we can have our
 
02:12:28.850 --> 02:12:28.860 align:start position:0%
researcher look at it but my
 
02:12:30.470 --> 02:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
recollection was
 
02:12:33.229 --> 02:12:33.239 align:start position:0%
a bill almost exactly verbatim to this
 
02:12:36.250 --> 02:12:36.260 align:start position:0%
bill came before Judiciary in 2019
 
02:12:39.229 --> 02:12:39.239 align:start position:0%
and the the committee
 
02:12:42.589 --> 02:12:42.599 align:start position:0%
amended it to divert the funds that were
 
02:12:45.350 --> 02:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
taken by any forfeiture to a different
 
02:12:48.830 --> 02:12:48.840 align:start position:0%
use and that's why the bill failed
 
02:12:52.370 --> 02:12:52.380 align:start position:0%
um but I remember that
 
02:12:56.209 --> 02:12:56.219 align:start position:0%
judiciary had had because it was a civil
 
02:12:58.310 --> 02:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
matter in that bill not a criminal
 
02:13:00.589 --> 02:13:00.599 align:start position:0%
matter as is in this bill
 
02:13:02.569 --> 02:13:02.579 align:start position:0%
um that there were several people that
 
02:13:04.430 --> 02:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
served on that committee and are still
 
02:13:05.810 --> 02:13:05.820 align:start position:0%
serving on that committee that would be
 
02:13:08.149 --> 02:13:08.159 align:start position:0%
very beneficial their recollection of
 
02:13:10.430 --> 02:13:10.440 align:start position:0%
this subject matter would be very useful
 
02:13:12.830 --> 02:13:12.840 align:start position:0%
to a subcommittee of our committee uh
 
02:13:14.930 --> 02:13:14.940 align:start position:0%
that use works on the retainment of this
 
02:13:18.669 --> 02:13:18.679 align:start position:0%
bill and I spoke with uh chairman Lynn
 
02:13:22.250 --> 02:13:22.260 align:start position:0%
prior to us convening this morning and I
 
02:13:25.370 --> 02:13:25.380 align:start position:0%
I think it might be worth it to as he
 
02:13:26.870 --> 02:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
said they would be willing to work with
 
02:13:29.930 --> 02:13:29.940 align:start position:0%
us we we appoint a subcommittee and ask
 
02:13:32.990 --> 02:13:33.000 align:start position:0%
the speaker or or the chairman of
 
02:13:35.390 --> 02:13:35.400 align:start position:0%
Judiciary also to assign some members of
 
02:13:37.790 --> 02:13:37.800 align:start position:0%
his committee to work with us so that we
 
02:13:40.550 --> 02:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
uh actually have subject matter experts
 
02:13:43.129 --> 02:13:43.139 align:start position:0%
working on this so we don't have to all
 
02:13:46.550 --> 02:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:48.350 --> 02:13:48.360 align:start position:0%
um all I heard is I volunteered a chair
 
02:13:51.350 --> 02:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
subcommittee is that is that was that
 
02:13:53.149 --> 02:13:53.159 align:start position:0%
what everyone else heard I think yeah I
 
02:13:55.129 --> 02:13:55.139 align:start position:0%
think so yeah okay with that I'm going
 
02:13:56.450 --> 02:13:56.460 align:start position:0%
to ask the clerk to call the roll on
 
02:13:56.460 --> 02:13:58.310 align:start position:0%
to ask the clerk to call the roll on
retention

02:13:58.310 --> 02:13:58.320 align:start position:0%

the next week on subcommittees and
 
02:14:54.109 --> 02:14:54.119 align:start position:0%
things like that and I closed the
 
02:14:57.770 --> 02:14:57.780 align:start position:0%
executive session and stand by before we
 
02:14:57.780 --> 02:15:27.530 align:start position:0%
executive session and stand by before we
break

02:15:27.530 --> 02:15:27.540 align:start position:0%

02:15:50.030 --> 02:15:50.040 align:start position:0%
this point I'm going to open an
 
02:15:51.770 --> 02:15:51.780 align:start position:0%
executive session on a bill that we had
 
02:15:54.350 --> 02:15:54.360 align:start position:0%
already opened and
 
02:15:54.360 --> 02:15:55.550 align:start position:0%
already opened and
um

02:15:55.550 --> 02:15:55.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:57.109 --> 02:15:57.119 align:start position:0%
or was I don't I don't know coffee
 
02:15:59.390 --> 02:15:59.400 align:start position:0%
opened or not but it was scheduled
 
02:16:02.390 --> 02:16:02.400 align:start position:0%
um it's House Bill 653
 
02:16:04.669 --> 02:16:04.679 align:start position:0%
I'm an open executive session
 
02:16:06.490 --> 02:16:06.500 align:start position:0%
um I have discussed it with the
 
02:16:09.830 --> 02:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
representative gathright who agrees
 
02:16:12.229 --> 02:16:12.239 align:start position:0%
to open the executive session on this
 
02:16:12.239 --> 02:16:13.010 align:start position:0%
to open the executive session on this
now

02:16:13.010 --> 02:16:13.020 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:16:15.050 --> 02:16:15.060 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to recognize myself for a
 
02:16:18.290 --> 02:16:18.300 align:start position:0%
motion to retain
 
02:16:20.209 --> 02:16:20.219 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative gathright
 
02:16:22.129 --> 02:16:22.139 align:start position:0%
I'll speak to my motion this is another
 
02:16:23.750 --> 02:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
bail bill
 
02:16:25.790 --> 02:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
um we've discussed what we're going to
 
02:16:27.850 --> 02:16:27.860 align:start position:0%
work on this bill issue over the summer
 
02:16:30.229 --> 02:16:30.239 align:start position:0%
we already have a study committee or
 
02:16:31.550 --> 02:16:31.560 align:start position:0%
commission formed out of one of the
 
02:16:33.530 --> 02:16:33.540 align:start position:0%
bills and it's my intention to take
 
02:16:36.110 --> 02:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
pieces from all the bills and work with
 
02:16:38.750 --> 02:16:38.760 align:start position:0%
them and there's also another bill that
 
02:16:40.969 --> 02:16:40.979 align:start position:0%
is almost identical coming out of the
 
02:16:44.270 --> 02:16:44.280 align:start position:0%
Senate so I think that with all these
 
02:16:47.089 --> 02:16:47.099 align:start position:0%
bail bills flying around in the orbit we
 
02:16:48.589 --> 02:16:48.599 align:start position:0%
need to collect them and clean them up
 
02:16:52.910 --> 02:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
and um and take a serious look at it as
 
02:16:54.469 --> 02:16:54.479 align:start position:0%
well as some of you are aware I'm
 
02:16:56.389 --> 02:16:56.399 align:start position:0%
working on a technology issue that's
 
02:16:58.730 --> 02:16:58.740 align:start position:0%
going to assist with this as well with
 
02:17:02.810 --> 02:17:02.820 align:start position:0%
the state police so with that I'm going
 
02:17:10.429 --> 02:17:10.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:12.650 --> 02:17:12.660 align:start position:0%
the very beginning we realized what we
 
02:17:12.660 --> 02:17:13.730 align:start position:0%
the very beginning we realized what we
had

02:17:13.730 --> 02:17:13.740 align:start position:0%
had
 
02:17:15.410 --> 02:17:15.420 align:start position:0%
from the very beginning we realized that
 
02:17:18.530 --> 02:17:18.540 align:start position:0%
we have quite a few bail bills and we do
 
02:17:21.290 --> 02:17:21.300 align:start position:0%
want to do due diligence with the right
 
02:17:24.169 --> 02:17:24.179 align:start position:0%
thing to do and the correct process for
 
02:17:29.089 --> 02:17:29.099 align:start position:0%
everything so I agree 100 with our chair

to the people here to the public we take
 
02:17:41.150 --> 02:17:41.160 align:start position:0%
this bail issue very seriously and we

produce a piece of legislation this year
 
02:17:49.129 --> 02:17:49.139 align:start position:0%

02:17:52.790 --> 02:17:52.800 align:start position:0%
cautious and ensure that everything's

sure that we're not violating anyone's

02:18:01.190 --> 02:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
agree on whatever piece of legislation
 
02:18:02.629 --> 02:18:02.639 align:start position:0%
