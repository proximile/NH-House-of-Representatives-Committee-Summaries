been before this committee uh before uh
 
00:08:17.749 --> 00:08:17.759 align:start position:0%
last year specifically and I think maybe
 
00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:20.720 align:start position:0%
the year before that too um it basically
 
00:08:23.309 --> 00:08:23.319 align:start position:0%
is a bill to authorize the Department of
 
00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:25.800 align:start position:0%
Education to issue
 
00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:28.520 align:start position:0%

investigation

00:08:30.309 --> 00:08:30.319 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
00:08:30.319 --> 00:08:31.469 align:start position:0%
investigation
Andor

00:08:31.469 --> 00:08:31.479 align:start position:0%
Andor
 
00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
hearings um related to uh investigations
 
00:08:37.389 --> 00:08:37.399 align:start position:0%
of uh the code of conduct for New
 
00:08:41.670 --> 00:08:41.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Educators um the
 
00:08:44.829 --> 00:08:44.839 align:start position:0%
um the bill uses I for lack of a better
 
00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:46.880 align:start position:0%
term I would say the bill uses what I
 
00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:48.720 align:start position:0%
would describe as sort of standard
 
00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:52.440 align:start position:0%
subpoena language um and it's designed
 
00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:55.720 align:start position:0%
to allow subpoenas to be issued uh both
 
00:08:58.310 --> 00:08:58.320 align:start position:0%
during the investigatory stage of an
 
00:08:58.320 --> 00:08:59.870 align:start position:0%
during the investigatory stage of an
investigation

00:08:59.870 --> 00:08:59.880 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:03.640 align:start position:0%
and then uh for subpoenas to be issued
 
00:09:05.829 --> 00:09:05.839 align:start position:0%
um uh in connection with any
 
00:09:08.269 --> 00:09:08.279 align:start position:0%
adjudicatory proceedings that may result
 
00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:11.560 align:start position:0%
from uh the investig from the
 
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
investigation um I my recollection
 
00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:20.320 align:start position:0%
is that there were
 
00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:21.949 align:start position:0%
is that there were
um

00:09:21.949 --> 00:09:21.959 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:24.720 align:start position:0%
some assertions
 
00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:28.240 align:start position:0%
made during previous uh iterations of
 
00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:32.120 align:start position:0%
this bill um that this was uh that what
 
00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
was being proposed here was really
 
00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:37.120 align:start position:0%
highly unusual that it was not um that
 
00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
this was not uh something that was uh
 
00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:42.120 align:start position:0%
was sort of
 
00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:45.680 align:start position:0%
standard uh in in this in the in either
 
00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
the education context or an
 
00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
administrative law generally which was
 
00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
contrary to my understanding of of uh
 
00:09:54.509 --> 00:09:54.519 align:start position:0%
how the law worked but I had occasion
 
00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:56.240 align:start position:0%
and I know representative cutab will be
 
00:09:58.829 --> 00:09:58.839 align:start position:0%
here before long she actually did some
 
00:10:00.949 --> 00:10:00.959 align:start position:0%
she's she actually spent some time doing
 
00:10:02.949 --> 00:10:02.959 align:start position:0%
some research on this and apparently
 
00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:05.200 align:start position:0%
every other state in New England and she
 
00:10:07.269 --> 00:10:07.279 align:start position:0%
I spoke to her this morning she quoted
 
00:10:09.389 --> 00:10:09.399 align:start position:0%
Connecticut Connecticut has a statute
 
00:10:10.949 --> 00:10:10.959 align:start position:0%
that is
 
00:10:13.949 --> 00:10:13.959 align:start position:0%
virtually not I wouldn't say in wording
 
00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:16.040 align:start position:0%
but virt in terms of purpose it
 
00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:17.200 align:start position:0%
basically says the commissioner of
 
00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:18.640 align:start position:0%
Education can issue subpoenas for
 
00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:20.680 align:start position:0%
investigations I and in fact I don't
 
00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
think I I don't think there it's even
 
00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
limited to investigations of of uh um
 
00:10:30.509 --> 00:10:30.519 align:start position:0%
teach teer credentialing I think it's
 
00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:32.120 align:start position:0%
just basically some anything that's
 
00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:35.160 align:start position:0%
within the jurisdiction of the uh the
 
00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:36.560 align:start position:0%
Department of Education that they have
 
00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
authority to investigate and again
 
00:10:40.389 --> 00:10:40.399 align:start position:0%
according to according to representative
 
00:10:44.629 --> 00:10:44.639 align:start position:0%
kutab uh that's that's the uh that's the
 
00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
the situation throughout New England I I
 
00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:49.680 align:start position:0%
would be very surprised if it wasn't the
 
00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
situation you know in Most states I mean
 
00:10:56.590 --> 00:10:56.600 align:start position:0%
again most if you're going to give an in
 
00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
uh an agency the authority to
 
00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
investigate and if you're going to give
 
00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:05.560 align:start position:0%
an agency the authority to hold hearings
 
00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:07.320 align:start position:0%
and take some kind of disciplinary
 
00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:09.480 align:start position:0%
action it just makes sense that they
 
00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:11.480 align:start position:0%
ought to have authority to to issue
 
00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:14.320 align:start position:0%
subpoenas because otherwise I mean I
 
00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:17.000 align:start position:0%
mean in a just stop and think of it the
 
00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:20.200 align:start position:0%
equivalent this is it's not limited to
 
00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:22.360 align:start position:0%
the education department but it's it's
 
00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:25.720 align:start position:0%
this is this is the equivalent an admin
 
00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:27.440 align:start position:0%
the administrative equivalent whether
 
00:11:28.949 --> 00:11:28.959 align:start position:0%
it's the education department or the
 
00:11:30.629 --> 00:11:30.639 align:start position:0%
department dep of Environmental Services
 
00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:32.920 align:start position:0%
or whatever Department of Labor this is
 
00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:35.560 align:start position:0%
the equivalent uh the administrative
 
00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
equivalent of a of a trial there's uh
 
00:11:41.069 --> 00:11:41.079 align:start position:0%
you know of of an investigation in let's
 
00:11:43.069 --> 00:11:43.079 align:start position:0%
say that would be conducted by the
 
00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:44.680 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office or a county
 
00:11:48.509 --> 00:11:48.519 align:start position:0%
attorney's office um uh and they have to
 
00:11:51.069 --> 00:11:51.079 align:start position:0%
have the they have to have the ability
 
00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:54.680 align:start position:0%
both to compel witnesses to appear and
 
00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:56.480 align:start position:0%
compel the production of documents in
 
00:11:58.389 --> 00:11:58.399 align:start position:0%
the investigative stage and then they
 
00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:00.160 align:start position:0%
have to be able to compel both sides
 
00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:03.680 align:start position:0%
both the the pro the proponent or the
 
00:12:05.269 --> 00:12:05.279 align:start position:0%
prosecution so to speak whether it's
 
00:12:07.389 --> 00:12:07.399 align:start position:0%
civil or criminal and the defense have
 
00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
to have the ability to compel witnesses
 
00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:11.240 align:start position:0%
to appear at the hearing that's really
 
00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
all that this does it has Provisions in
 
00:12:17.389 --> 00:12:17.399 align:start position:0%
it that allow for um uh a party that's
 
00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:19.560 align:start position:0%
subpoena who thinks the subpoena is over
 
00:12:22.269 --> 00:12:22.279 align:start position:0%
broad to move to quash The subpoena or
 
00:12:26.389 --> 00:12:26.399 align:start position:0%
to limit The subpoena um I I you know to
 
00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:27.880 align:start position:0%
the extent that there's that there's a
 
00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:30.040 align:start position:0%
claim that this is somehow
 
00:12:34.069 --> 00:12:34.079 align:start position:0%
unfair um uh or unprecedented I I submit
 
00:12:37.389 --> 00:12:37.399 align:start position:0%
that it's just not it's just not correct
 
00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:39.320 align:start position:0%
so I'm happy to answer any questions I
 
00:12:41.269 --> 00:12:41.279 align:start position:0%
think it's a good I think it's a good
 
00:12:44.829 --> 00:12:44.839 align:start position:0%
bill and U I hope you'll support
 
00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:47.560 align:start position:0%
it representative
 
00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:52.360 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you um good morning um can
 
00:12:56.069 --> 00:12:56.079 align:start position:0%
you tell me who provides legal
 
00:12:58.710 --> 00:12:58.720 align:start position:0%
representation for the Department of
 
00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:02.240 align:start position:0%
educ in Connecticut who provides legal
 
00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:05.120 align:start position:0%
representation you know I I I don't know
 
00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:06.680 align:start position:0%
but I would I know they have an attorney
 
00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
general's office uh in as I recall in
 
00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
Connecticut the Attorney General's
 
00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:13.720 align:start position:0%
office is limited unlike in New
 
00:13:15.829 --> 00:13:15.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is limited to handling civil
 
00:13:19.509 --> 00:13:19.519 align:start position:0%
matters but I suspect that it might be
 
00:13:22.069 --> 00:13:22.079 align:start position:0%
that when
 
00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:25.160 align:start position:0%
the when I don't know this but I'm
 
00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:27.160 align:start position:0%
speculating I think this is probably you
 
00:13:30.189 --> 00:13:30.199 align:start position:0%
know informed speculation that the
 
00:13:32.069 --> 00:13:32.079 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:35.160 align:start position:0%
Education handles things internally
 
00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:36.760 align:start position:0%
within the Department of Education but
 
00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:39.560 align:start position:0%
if they have to go to court then the it
 
00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:42.360 align:start position:0%
would be the Attorney General
 
00:13:46.269 --> 00:13:46.279 align:start position:0%
customarily is the is the agency that
 
00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:48.720 align:start position:0%
represents the state or its agencies in
 
00:13:50.189 --> 00:13:50.199 align:start position:0%
court so I would suspect that would be
 
00:13:51.269 --> 00:13:51.279 align:start position:0%
the case in
 
00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:53.560 align:start position:0%
Connecticut uh thank you very much I'm
 
00:13:55.949 --> 00:13:55.959 align:start position:0%
not going to do what I'd like to do
 
00:13:59.189 --> 00:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
which is to ask you the same question
 
00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
about uh Massachusetts Vermont Maine and
 
00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
anybody else I might have Rhode Island I
 
00:14:06.509 --> 00:14:06.519 align:start position:0%
didn't want to forget Rhode Island of
 
00:14:10.949 --> 00:14:10.959 align:start position:0%
course um um is it uh not true Mr
 
00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
chairman that in um the state of New
 
00:14:16.269 --> 00:14:16.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire which likes to do things its
 
00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:21.000 align:start position:0%
own way it is the attorney general that
 
00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:24.240 align:start position:0%
provides uh legal
 
00:14:27.189 --> 00:14:27.199 align:start position:0%
representation uh for the Department of
 
00:14:29.749 --> 00:14:29.759 align:start position:0%
Education when you say provides legal
 
00:14:32.949 --> 00:14:32.959 align:start position:0%
representation I think I I I I guess I I
 
00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
need to know exactly what you mean by
 
00:14:37.189 --> 00:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
that I think it is certainly true that
 
00:14:39.189 --> 00:14:39.199 align:start position:0%
if the Department of Education is going
 
00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:42.040 align:start position:0%
to have to appear in court that it's the
 
00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:44.120 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office that does the
 
00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
representation but in term you know I
 
00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:50.440 align:start position:0%
think that's true really for any um
 
00:14:52.749 --> 00:14:52.759 align:start position:0%
agency uh maybe there's maybe there's
 
00:14:55.069 --> 00:14:55.079 align:start position:0%
some exceptions but I would be surprised
 
00:14:57.910 --> 00:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
I I think generally the attorney general
 
00:14:59.550 --> 00:14:59.560 align:start position:0%
pro provides the
 
00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
Inc Court representation for agencies
 
00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:04.720 align:start position:0%
but I think that's this is not dealing
 
00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:06.440 align:start position:0%
with Inc Court representation it's
 
00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
dealing with administrative proceedings
 
00:15:11.069 --> 00:15:11.079 align:start position:0%
and I think in administrative
 
00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
proceedings um it's it's not at all
 
00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:16.720 align:start position:0%
unusual for the for the agency to handle
 
00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:19.800 align:start position:0%
its own administrative proceedings um um
 
00:15:21.829 --> 00:15:21.839 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I believe that what
 
00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
has historically been true is it's the
 
00:15:26.949 --> 00:15:26.959 align:start position:0%
department of of justice that has
 
00:15:28.949 --> 00:15:28.959 align:start position:0%
handled those responsibilities for the
 
00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:30.680 align:start position:0%
Department of Education but you're the
 
00:15:33.829 --> 00:15:33.839 align:start position:0%
expert I'm not thank you representative
 
00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:36.360 align:start position:0%
Paige thank you uh Mr chair and thank
 
00:15:38.949 --> 00:15:38.959 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair for taking my question I
 
00:15:43.389 --> 00:15:43.399 align:start position:0%
guess on both sides um to paraphrase Yi
 
00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:45.920 align:start position:0%
Bara this is like deja vu all over again
 
00:15:49.389 --> 00:15:49.399 align:start position:0%
again um I remember the origins of this
 
00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:52.720 align:start position:0%
bill coming from the divisive Concepts
 
00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:54.880 align:start position:0%
Bill and empowering the um Commissioner
 
00:15:57.829 --> 00:15:57.839 align:start position:0%
of Education to um prosecute cases on
 
00:16:00.030 --> 00:16:00.040 align:start position:0%
behalf of parents that
 
00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
that alleged there was some violation of
 
00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
that and then I lost track of that but
 
00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:06.720 align:start position:0%
it's somewhere I think it's enjoined in
 
00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:09.160 align:start position:0%
the first circuit or something I've lost
 
00:16:12.269 --> 00:16:12.279 align:start position:0%
track but in any event in the multiple
 
00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:14.480 align:start position:0%
rounds of testimony on that we had the
 
00:16:16.389 --> 00:16:16.399 align:start position:0%
Department of Education investigator
 
00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:17.360 align:start position:0%
come and
 
00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:21.160 align:start position:0%
testify and he said he was doing a great
 
00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:24.920 align:start position:0%
job at his job in terms of policing for
 
00:16:27.629 --> 00:16:27.639 align:start position:0%
lack of a better term um teachers that
 
00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:31.240 align:start position:0%
may have be up for losing their license
 
00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:33.680 align:start position:0%
as I recall he sort of suggested
 
00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:35.720 align:start position:0%
this would be another tool in his
 
00:16:37.949 --> 00:16:37.959 align:start position:0%
toolbox to to get this but he didn't
 
00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:39.560 align:start position:0%
indicate that there was a problem we
 
00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
were trying to solve and so um I guess
 
00:16:45.269 --> 00:16:45.279 align:start position:0%
I'm putting my little conservative hat
 
00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:47.680 align:start position:0%
on again less government is more for me
 
00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:50.240 align:start position:0%
but I'm wondering has there been any
 
00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:52.040 align:start position:0%
indication from the Department that they
 
00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:54.440 align:start position:0%
are unable to do their job since the
 
00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:56.480 align:start position:0%
last time we heard about this to now
 
00:17:00.389 --> 00:17:00.399 align:start position:0%
that they would need this power
 
00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:02.560 align:start position:0%
have I heard something since the LA I
 
00:17:05.189 --> 00:17:05.199 align:start position:0%
guess I have to say my my recollection
 
00:17:07.189 --> 00:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
of the earlier test I mean I I think I
 
00:17:09.069 --> 00:17:09.079 align:start position:0%
largely agree with what you said that
 
00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:10.520 align:start position:0%
the the the investigator from the
 
00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:12.400 align:start position:0%
Department I think he was if I recall a
 
00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
former state police officer um I think
 
00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:17.160 align:start position:0%
he did say as you as you indicate that
 
00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:19.000 align:start position:0%
you know there there generally has been
 
00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
no problem in getting information I
 
00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:23.000 align:start position:0%
think he did say that there if I recall
 
00:17:24.949 --> 00:17:24.959 align:start position:0%
that there were a couple of instances
 
00:17:26.669 --> 00:17:26.679 align:start position:0%
where there was a timing issue of things
 
00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
getting delayed more than he would have
 
00:17:31.029 --> 00:17:31.039 align:start position:0%
been comfortable with but I but I
 
00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
believe I believe we heard testimony
 
00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:36.360 align:start position:0%
from some witness and I can't tell you
 
00:17:38.789 --> 00:17:38.799 align:start position:0%
who it was that in indicating that there
 
00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:42.160 align:start position:0%
were some school districts that were
 
00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:44.720 align:start position:0%
simply saying we're not giving you the
 
00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:48.400 align:start position:0%
information um uh now whether that I the
 
00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
the exact context of that I don't
 
00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:52.360 align:start position:0%
remember but I do I do remember that
 
00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:55.440 align:start position:0%
there was some testimony to that effect
 
00:17:57.870 --> 00:17:57.880 align:start position:0%
so you know I guess what what I would
 
00:18:01.549 --> 00:18:01.559 align:start position:0%
say as a response to your question is I
 
00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
think it makes sense for as I said
 
00:18:07.149 --> 00:18:07.159 align:start position:0%
before if an agency has the authority to
 
00:18:09.149 --> 00:18:09.159 align:start position:0%
conduct investigations and to hold
 
00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:11.440 align:start position:0%
hearings they it just makes sense that
 
00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:14.280 align:start position:0%
they ought to have a power to compel
 
00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:16.360 align:start position:0%
people to comply they it's somebody
 
00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:18.120 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be a you know if the if the
 
00:18:19.909 --> 00:18:19.919 align:start position:0%
Department of Education is conducting an
 
00:18:23.149 --> 00:18:23.159 align:start position:0%
investigation of of an educator um and
 
00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:26.000 align:start position:0%
wants to get documents or records or
 
00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:28.520 align:start position:0%
Witnesses the the respondent shouldn't
 
00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
be ble to say go pound sand and and you
 
00:18:34.549 --> 00:18:34.559 align:start position:0%
know without a subpoena power that sort
 
00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:36.520 align:start position:0%
of effectively is give you give them
 
00:18:37.789 --> 00:18:37.799 align:start position:0%
that Authority and I don't think they
 
00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:39.880 align:start position:0%
should have
 
00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:43.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:46.480 align:start position:0%
buron thank you Mr
 
00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:49.360 align:start position:0%
chair I just wanted to ask simply I wish
 
00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
I had somebody in front of me that has
 
00:18:53.549 --> 00:18:53.559 align:start position:0%
experienced this process you know
 
00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
because at this point I don't feel like
 
00:18:56.990 --> 00:18:57.000 align:start position:0%
I have enough information because I
 
00:18:58.909 --> 00:18:58.919 align:start position:0%
don't know typically what happens to the
 
00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
parties like CU here it says any cost
 
00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:03.400 align:start position:0%
incurred issuing a subpoena is the
 
00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:05.080 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the party requesting
 
00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:07.480 align:start position:0%
it unless determined there's an unless
 
00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
there that bothers me determined by the
 
00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:13.640 align:start position:0%
officer yeah by the treny officer I
 
00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:15.640 align:start position:0%
don't know but that's what I'm feeling
 
00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:17.480 align:start position:0%
comfortable on um I feel like we're all
 
00:19:19.029 --> 00:19:19.039 align:start position:0%
kind of a little know a little bit about
 
00:19:19.039 --> 00:19:19.990 align:start position:0%
kind of a little know a little bit about
it

00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:22.600 align:start position:0%
but I feel like I don't know
 
00:19:24.549 --> 00:19:24.559 align:start position:0%
enough and I've been on a school board
 
00:19:27.549 --> 00:19:27.559 align:start position:0%
for 12 years so this is a time for
 
00:19:27.559 --> 00:19:30.230 align:start position:0%
for 12 years so this is a time for
questions

00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm done I just wanted to say that
 
00:19:36.149 --> 00:19:36.159 align:start position:0%
I'm uncomfortable about it just simply
 
00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:37.960 align:start position:0%
because I don't feel like I have enough
 
00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:48.360 align:start position:0%
Birch thank you Mr chair Mr chair um I
 
00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:51.080 align:start position:0%
I'm following up in your analogy of this
 
00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
to a trial which is some respects it is
 
00:19:58.789 --> 00:19:58.799 align:start position:0%
um unless I'm missing it it's true that
 
00:20:02.669 --> 00:20:02.679 align:start position:0%
that under this bill one side gets to
 
00:20:06.029 --> 00:20:06.039 align:start position:0%
subpoena and the other side doesn't now
 
00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
that seem we're we're in the we're here
 
00:20:14.669 --> 00:20:14.679 align:start position:0%
in the bill did I miss saying that all
 
00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
parties have a similar right so right so
 
00:20:21.789 --> 00:20:21.799 align:start position:0%
I think here here's here's the analysis
 
00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
if you look at
 
00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:27.640 align:start position:0%
sections uh Roman numeral
 
00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:30.320 align:start position:0%
13 in section one of the bill and you go
 
00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:32.070 align:start position:0%
13 in section one of the bill and you go
from

00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:39.480 align:start position:0%
13d I'm sorry
 
00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
13A yeah 13A through 13d those are uh
 
00:20:46.909 --> 00:20:46.919 align:start position:0%
the the the paragraphs and subparagraphs
 
00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:49.240 align:start position:0%
that deal with what I would refer to as
 
00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:52.280 align:start position:0%
investigative subpoenas which would be
 
00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:56.120 align:start position:0%
issued only by the only in in favor of
 
00:20:58.669 --> 00:20:58.679 align:start position:0%
the party conducting the investigation
 
00:21:00.789 --> 00:21:00.799 align:start position:0%
draw the analogy to the grand jury the
 
00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:03.200 align:start position:0%
gr the the state can subpoena witnesses
 
00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:05.000 align:start position:0%
to the grand jury the defendant doesn't
 
00:21:06.669 --> 00:21:06.679 align:start position:0%
get to do that doesn't have subpoena
 
00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:09.000 align:start position:0%
power to to subpoena people to the grand
 
00:21:13.269 --> 00:21:13.279 align:start position:0%
jury paragraph e says that any
 
00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:16.320 align:start position:0%
information that is in that is gathered
 
00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:19.000 align:start position:0%
during the investigative process shall
 
00:21:21.269 --> 00:21:21.279 align:start position:0%
be a shall be made available to both
 
00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:24.320 align:start position:0%
parties at the at the proceeding that
 
00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
may result from the investigation and
 
00:21:29.669 --> 00:21:29.679 align:start position:0%
then particularly paragraph X
 
00:21:32.549 --> 00:21:32.559 align:start position:0%
says that in any adjudicatory
 
00:21:34.909 --> 00:21:34.919 align:start position:0%
proceeding um a hearings officer May
 
00:21:38.149 --> 00:21:38.159 align:start position:0%
issue subpoenas to both sides so that
 
00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:40.200 align:start position:0%
that's the equivalent of the trial
 
00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:42.480 align:start position:0%
subpoenas if you
 
00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
will assuming that there's basically two
 
00:21:50.669 --> 00:21:50.679 align:start position:0%
sides here you've got the Department of
 
00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:55.720 align:start position:0%
Education and the um the person being uh
 
00:21:59.510 --> 00:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
teacher whatever being investigated
 
00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:01.960 align:start position:0%
if I understand your
 
00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:07.400 align:start position:0%
answer that the one side whether it's at
 
00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
the Grand Jury level or later adud
 
00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:13.350 align:start position:0%
the Grand Jury level or later adud
judicatory

00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:13.360 align:start position:0%
judicatory
 
00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:18.520 align:start position:0%
level has the sole authority to collect
 
00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:22.840 align:start position:0%
the information that information must be
 
00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:26.720 align:start position:0%
shared but it's the information is
 
00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
limited to what the Department of
 
00:22:32.269 --> 00:22:32.279 align:start position:0%
Education wants to produce and does not
 
00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
cover what the teacher may want produced
 
00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
is that correct well if you're saying
 
00:22:41.669 --> 00:22:41.679 align:start position:0%
during the investigative stage in either
 
00:22:43.549 --> 00:22:43.559 align:start position:0%
stage well in I think there's a big
 
00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:46.200 align:start position:0%
difference in the investigative stage it
 
00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:49.360 align:start position:0%
is it it is certainly true that and
 
00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
again I draw the analogy to the criminal
 
00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
process but but I think in any in any in
 
00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:56.840 align:start position:0%
any sort of administrative process it
 
00:22:58.990 --> 00:22:59.000 align:start position:0%
would be the same would be true in in
 
00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:02.320 align:start position:0%
the investigative stage it's the body
 
00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:05.000 align:start position:0%
that's doing the investigation that has
 
00:23:07.669 --> 00:23:07.679 align:start position:0%
the authority to compel people to comply
 
00:23:09.669 --> 00:23:09.679 align:start position:0%
now if a respondant knows that they're
 
00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
under investigation and I suspect it
 
00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:13.960 align:start position:0%
would be a rare case where they didn't
 
00:23:16.669 --> 00:23:16.679 align:start position:0%
can they ask people to voluntarily
 
00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:18.840 align:start position:0%
provide them with information of course
 
00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:21.440 align:start position:0%
but they I don't think and you correct
 
00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
me if I'm if I missed something but I
 
00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
don't think in any criminal process that
 
00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:29.440 align:start position:0%
I'm aware of that during the
 
00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:31.880 align:start position:0%
investigative stage the defendant or
 
00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
prospective defendant gets to subpoena
 
00:23:37.269 --> 00:23:37.279 align:start position:0%
people to come where to the there's no
 
00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
there's no case so they don't get the
 
00:23:40.269 --> 00:23:40.279 align:start position:0%
subpoena people to come to the grand
 
00:23:41.789 --> 00:23:41.799 align:start position:0%
jury that's for I don't want to belabor
 
00:23:44.269 --> 00:23:44.279 align:start position:0%
the question but when it moves to the
 
00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
adjudicatory stage right there the
 
00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:50.320 align:start position:0%
evidence that the Department of
 
00:23:54.029 --> 00:23:54.039 align:start position:0%
Education wants and people want is
 
00:23:57.070 --> 00:23:57.080 align:start position:0%
available right but there's no subpoena
 
00:24:01.029 --> 00:24:01.039 align:start position:0%
power for the the accused so to speak to
 
00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
have the equivalent ability to subpoena
 
00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:07.960 align:start position:0%
documents and people no that's not true
 
00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:09.200 align:start position:0%
that's what that's exactly what
 
00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:12.240 align:start position:0%
subsection F says if once you get to the
 
00:24:15.149 --> 00:24:15.159 align:start position:0%
once you get to the adjudicatory stage
 
00:24:17.669 --> 00:24:17.679 align:start position:0%
and there's a hearing of course the def
 
00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:20.600 align:start position:0%
the the the respondent the teacher can
 
00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
of course ask to have subpoenas issued
 
00:24:26.269 --> 00:24:26.279 align:start position:0%
for you know exculpatory evidence or
 
00:24:28.029 --> 00:24:28.039 align:start position:0%
evidence that favors a defense of course
 
00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:29.880 align:start position:0%
they can do that that's what f is
 
00:24:33.149 --> 00:24:33.159 align:start position:0%
designed to cover okay thank you
 
00:24:33.159 --> 00:24:35.149 align:start position:0%
designed to cover okay thank you
representative

00:24:35.149 --> 00:24:35.159 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:24:37.630 --> 00:24:37.640 align:start position:0%
andreos thank you Mr vice sh thank you
 
00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:40.720 align:start position:0%
Mr chair for taking my question as a
 
00:24:43.149 --> 00:24:43.159 align:start position:0%
citizen I've had several dealings with
 
00:24:46.350 --> 00:24:46.360 align:start position:0%
doe and I've always been told what a
 
00:24:48.909 --> 00:24:48.919 align:start position:0%
matter I take to him that we do not have
 
00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:53.080 align:start position:0%
statutory Authority just what statutory
 
00:24:56.510 --> 00:24:56.520 align:start position:0%
Authority does the doe have to do
 
00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:59.669 align:start position:0%
Authority does the doe have to do
investigations

00:24:59.669 --> 00:24:59.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:02.600 align:start position:0%
that's well I I that's I have to say
 
00:25:06.269 --> 00:25:06.279 align:start position:0%
that as I sit here right now I know that
 
00:25:07.549 --> 00:25:07.559 align:start position:0%
they have the authority to do
 
00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
investigation of the credentialing of
 
00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:11.720 align:start position:0%
teachers and whether or not they have
 
00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
violated you know the their the
 
00:25:17.430 --> 00:25:17.440 align:start position:0%
credentialing statutes I assume that
 
00:25:20.350 --> 00:25:20.360 align:start position:0%
they have other uh you know uh authority
 
00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:22.440 align:start position:0%
to do investigations I mean for for
 
00:25:25.269 --> 00:25:25.279 align:start position:0%
example if I suppose if they um if they
 
00:25:27.549 --> 00:25:27.559 align:start position:0%
thought that somebody they had a
 
00:25:29.669 --> 00:25:29.679 align:start position:0%
contract with with was not
 
00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
being um you know was not complying with
 
00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
the contract or something I would assume
 
00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
they could investigate that but I you
 
00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:38.240 align:start position:0%
know without having looked at it I I
 
00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
believe we have a witness here from the
 
00:25:42.430 --> 00:25:42.440 align:start position:0%
Department of Education who probably is
 
00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
much more familiar with that and could
 
00:25:46.789 --> 00:25:46.799 align:start position:0%
answer it so that I think they're in
 
00:25:49.789 --> 00:25:49.799 align:start position:0%
they're I guess I would say the the best
 
00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:51.480 align:start position:0%
I can tell you is I would assume they
 
00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:53.640 align:start position:0%
have investigations to do in other
 
00:25:55.110 --> 00:25:55.120 align:start position:0%
authority to do investigations in other
 
00:25:56.950 --> 00:25:56.960 align:start position:0%
areas but I don't know that for sure
 
00:25:59.870 --> 00:25:59.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative
 
00:26:02.669 --> 00:26:02.679 align:start position:0%
organ thank you very much Mr chair thank
 
00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
you and well thank you very much Mr uh
 
00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
usual sheriff for taking my taking my
 
00:26:11.389 --> 00:26:11.399 align:start position:0%
question so this as I see in um
 
00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
obviously in line five and six it's
 
00:26:15.149 --> 00:26:15.159 align:start position:0%
limited to one particular aspect of what
 
00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
the doe oversees which is the code of
 
00:26:20.389 --> 00:26:20.399 align:start position:0%
conduct for New Hampshire Educators and
 
00:26:23.269 --> 00:26:23.279 align:start position:0%
I wait just glancing quickly at the law
 
00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:25.320 align:start position:0%
looks like that's not just teachers but
 
00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:26.960 align:start position:0%
par professionals and everybody works
 
00:26:29.310 --> 00:26:29.320 align:start position:0%
directly with students but
 
00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:33.240 align:start position:0%
um why do we exclude other people and
 
00:26:35.909 --> 00:26:35.919 align:start position:0%
entities that Doe works with such as uh
 
00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:38.360 align:start position:0%
you know we've had issues with you
 
00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned vendors you provide services
 
00:26:43.029 --> 00:26:43.039 align:start position:0%
we had some somewhat poent somewhat
 
00:26:44.830 --> 00:26:44.840 align:start position:0%
controversial organizations for example
 
00:26:46.909 --> 00:26:46.919 align:start position:0%
providing uh course materials to the
 
00:26:50.669 --> 00:26:50.679 align:start position:0%
schools also um we've had issues we've
 
00:26:52.909 --> 00:26:52.919 align:start position:0%
had issues with we often many charter
 
00:26:54.789 --> 00:26:54.799 align:start position:0%
schools are often founded and failed so
 
00:26:57.389 --> 00:26:57.399 align:start position:0%
you often wonder like uh I don't think
 
00:26:59.029 --> 00:26:59.039 align:start position:0%
there's been any Criminal cases resolve
 
00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
those we want do Wonder like
 
00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
about you might have a situation where
 
00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
you want to investigate that and then of
 
00:27:09.269 --> 00:27:09.279 align:start position:0%
course you have the E EFA program which
 
00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:11.200 align:start position:0%
the administrations was turned over you
 
00:27:13.549 --> 00:27:13.559 align:start position:0%
know to a small nonprofit organization
 
00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:16.120 align:start position:0%
based in based based out of state and
 
00:27:19.389 --> 00:27:19.399 align:start position:0%
there's very poor oversight of it but
 
00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
you could certainly imagine uh and there
 
00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:22.720 align:start position:0%
already was some waste fraud and if he's
 
00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
found is a very limited audit so like U
 
00:27:28.510 --> 00:27:28.520 align:start position:0%
with this why doesn't this give the DOE
 
00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
The Authority The subpoena um those
 
00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:33.640 align:start position:0%
three types of entities vendors uh
 
00:27:37.269 --> 00:27:37.279 align:start position:0%
Charter School boards at fail and um the
 
00:27:39.789 --> 00:27:39.799 align:start position:0%
EFA U scholarship
 
00:27:41.909 --> 00:27:41.919 align:start position:0%
organization I'm I'm really very glad
 
00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:42.880 align:start position:0%
that you asked that question
 
00:27:44.669 --> 00:27:44.679 align:start position:0%
representative Oregon because my
 
00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:49.240 align:start position:0%
recollection is that way back when a
 
00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
year ago or two years ago when there was
 
00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:54.600 align:start position:0%
a first draft of this legislation it was
 
00:27:57.230 --> 00:27:57.240 align:start position:0%
broader it said that anything that the
 
00:27:59.269 --> 00:27:59.279 align:start position:0%
Department of Education
 
00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm summarizing here but my
 
00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:02.480 align:start position:0%
recollection is it would have given the
 
00:28:04.990 --> 00:28:05.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Education broad subpoena
 
00:28:07.029 --> 00:28:07.039 align:start position:0%
power to issue subpoenas in connection
 
00:28:08.509 --> 00:28:08.519 align:start position:0%
with anything that they had the
 
00:28:10.669 --> 00:28:10.679 align:start position:0%
authority to investigate and my
 
00:28:15.190 --> 00:28:15.200 align:start position:0%
recollection is that um people on on on
 
00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
the loyal opposition side of the of uh
 
00:28:21.029 --> 00:28:21.039 align:start position:0%
to to this issue were very concerned
 
00:28:23.149 --> 00:28:23.159 align:start position:0%
about that oh this is much too broad you
 
00:28:25.789 --> 00:28:25.799 align:start position:0%
know it should be limited to uh to to
 
00:28:29.149 --> 00:28:29.159 align:start position:0%
teacher credentialing and so that's what
 
00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:31.080 align:start position:0%
that's what this does it limits it to
 
00:28:36.310 --> 00:28:36.320 align:start position:0%
teacher credential um if you know um and
 
00:28:38.830 --> 00:28:38.840 align:start position:0%
so I that's that's the short answer to
 
00:28:40.590 --> 00:28:40.600 align:start position:0%
your question it's done that way in the
 
00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:43.360 align:start position:0%
hopes that that would eliminate the
 
00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:45.720 align:start position:0%
objections of some people that objected
 
00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:48.640 align:start position:0%
to the subpoena power being too broad
 
00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
fair enough I I think I did
 
00:28:53.269 --> 00:28:53.279 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you chair and thank
 
00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:56.120 align:start position:0%
you chair uh for the question um it's
 
00:28:57.549 --> 00:28:57.559 align:start position:0%
actually a similar question so when it
 
00:28:59.950 --> 00:28:59.960 align:start position:0%
says new Hampshire Educators is that
 
00:29:02.310 --> 00:29:02.320 align:start position:0%
only Public Schools or he mentioned
 
00:29:05.230 --> 00:29:05.240 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools but also like um you
 
00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
know private colleges and things like
 
00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:08.720 align:start position:0%
that is that included in New Hampshire
 
00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:10.880 align:start position:0%
Educators yeah I believe it's it's Ed as
 
00:29:13.029 --> 00:29:13.039 align:start position:0%
I understand it's Educators that have
 
00:29:16.029 --> 00:29:16.039 align:start position:0%
credentials now my understanding is that
 
00:29:17.789 --> 00:29:17.799 align:start position:0%
Educators that have credentials are not
 
00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:20.480 align:start position:0%
limited to public school teachers so if
 
00:29:21.789 --> 00:29:21.799 align:start position:0%
there you know if there's a qu if
 
00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
there's a claim that a credentialed
 
00:29:26.029 --> 00:29:26.039 align:start position:0%
educator who was not teaching in a
 
00:29:27.630 --> 00:29:27.640 align:start position:0%
public school had you know came under
 
00:29:31.669 --> 00:29:31.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:34.350 --> 00:29:34.360 align:start position:0%
apply any other questions representative
 
00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:35.549 align:start position:0%
apply any other questions representative
TR

00:29:35.549 --> 00:29:35.559 align:start position:0%
TR
 
00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:38.440 align:start position:0%
tur thank you Mr chair and thanks for
 
00:29:40.789 --> 00:29:40.799 align:start position:0%
taking the question um thinking back to
 
00:29:43.470 --> 00:29:43.480 align:start position:0%
the last time we heard the similar bill
 
00:29:45.789 --> 00:29:45.799 align:start position:0%
um I think one of the the takeaways that
 
00:29:48.789 --> 00:29:48.799 align:start position:0%
I recall was that that this can already
 
00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:50.320 align:start position:0%
be done through the Attorney General's
 
00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
office so maybe it builds on the
 
00:29:53.389 --> 00:29:53.399 align:start position:0%
question that that representative Smith
 
00:29:56.950 --> 00:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
started off asking is there a problem in
 
00:29:59.590 --> 00:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
which this can't be done through the
 
00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office currently in
 
00:30:03.669 --> 00:30:03.679 align:start position:0%
other words is is it necessary to set up
 
00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:05.840 align:start position:0%
this whole separate structure well you
 
00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
know I guess what I would say is is this
 
00:30:09.950 --> 00:30:09.960 align:start position:0%
I think if your question
 
00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
is could the Attorney
 
00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:17.200 align:start position:0%
General take over if you will the the
 
00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:20.120 align:start position:0%
sort of uh you know the
 
00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:22.760 align:start position:0%
investigation of teacher credentialing
 
00:30:25.630 --> 00:30:25.640 align:start position:0%
by the Department of Education in some
 
00:30:28.430 --> 00:30:28.440 align:start position:0%
particular case could they do that I
 
00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:30.640 align:start position:0%
think the answer is probably they could
 
00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:32.440 align:start position:0%
I I would defer to representative foron
 
00:30:33.549 --> 00:30:33.559 align:start position:0%
if unless there's something in the
 
00:30:34.909 --> 00:30:34.919 align:start position:0%
statute that I'm you know I'm just not
 
00:30:36.269 --> 00:30:36.279 align:start position:0%
aware of right now but I would think the
 
00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:39.480 align:start position:0%
answer to that is probably yes but I
 
00:30:41.950 --> 00:30:41.960 align:start position:0%
think that's you know I think that would
 
00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:43.110 align:start position:0%
think that's you know I think that would
be

00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:43.120 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:30:45.509 --> 00:30:45.519 align:start position:0%
true really of of almost any
 
00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
administrative investigation I assume
 
00:30:49.310 --> 00:30:49.320 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General would have that
 
00:30:53.029 --> 00:30:53.039 align:start position:0%
Authority if they wanted to but to to me
 
00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
I think that's that's not an appropriate
 
00:30:58.350 --> 00:30:58.360 align:start position:0%
answer because
 
00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
the the the agencies thems they conduct
 
00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:04.600 align:start position:0%
these investigations internally and they
 
00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
should at least in my view they should
 
00:31:08.789 --> 00:31:08.799 align:start position:0%
be able to do that can I do a followup
 
00:31:11.669 --> 00:31:11.679 align:start position:0%
yes follow up um so just to clarify what
 
00:31:13.549 --> 00:31:13.559 align:start position:0%
I was really asking was just about the
 
00:31:15.629 --> 00:31:15.639 align:start position:0%
subpoena I I understand that the
 
00:31:17.269 --> 00:31:17.279 align:start position:0%
Department of Education would be the one
 
00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:19.240 align:start position:0%
that would have to investigate the
 
00:31:21.149 --> 00:31:21.159 align:start position:0%
actual underlying matter I guess the
 
00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
question is if they were running into a
 
00:31:25.549 --> 00:31:25.559 align:start position:0%
roadblock and they felt like you know
 
00:31:28.509 --> 00:31:28.519 align:start position:0%
compulsory participation was needed
 
00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:30.440 align:start position:0%
my understanding is they could go to the
 
00:31:32.350 --> 00:31:32.360 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office to seek
 
00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:34.240 align:start position:0%
the just the subpoena not to turn over
 
00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:35.320 align:start position:0%
the whole
 
00:31:39.190 --> 00:31:39.200 align:start position:0%
process see just this well you know I I
 
00:31:41.830 --> 00:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
mean I think I I guess you know I'm as
 
00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:44.840 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking this through I think that
 
00:31:48.789 --> 00:31:48.799 align:start position:0%
without some without some
 
00:31:48.799 --> 00:31:51.310 align:start position:0%
without some without some
Authority

00:31:51.310 --> 00:31:51.320 align:start position:0%
Authority
 
00:31:54.509 --> 00:31:54.519 align:start position:0%
giving giving the authority to
 
00:31:57.110 --> 00:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
compel the production of documents or
 
00:31:59.950 --> 00:31:59.960 align:start position:0%
Witnesses in connection with an
 
00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:01.509 align:start position:0%
Witnesses in connection with an
administrative

00:32:01.509 --> 00:32:01.519 align:start position:0%
administrative
 
00:32:05.070 --> 00:32:05.080 align:start position:0%
investigation um I don't I don't think
 
00:32:06.789 --> 00:32:06.799 align:start position:0%
that that would I don't think that the
 
00:32:08.669 --> 00:32:08.679 align:start position:0%
Attorney General could do that I think
 
00:32:10.509 --> 00:32:10.519 align:start position:0%
what the attorney if what the Attorney
 
00:32:13.230 --> 00:32:13.240 align:start position:0%
General would have to do I think would
 
00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:16.760 align:start position:0%
be to would be to go to court and seek a
 
00:32:19.310 --> 00:32:19.320 align:start position:0%
subpoena um in from the court because I
 
00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:21.480 align:start position:0%
don't I don't think that there's a
 
00:32:24.789 --> 00:32:24.799 align:start position:0%
statute that generally gives the
 
00:32:26.789 --> 00:32:26.799 align:start position:0%
Attorney General the authority to issue
 
00:32:26.799 --> 00:32:28.909 align:start position:0%
Attorney General the authority to issue
subpoenas

00:32:28.909 --> 00:32:28.919 align:start position:0%
subpoenas
 
00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:32.720 align:start position:0%
in education matters I think I I think
 
00:32:34.190 --> 00:32:34.200 align:start position:0%
you know the Attorney General I I
 
00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
definitely agree the Attorney General
 
00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:37.720 align:start position:0%
could go to court and petition for the
 
00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
issuance of a subpoena but it it seems
 
00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
to me that you know just as we talk
 
00:32:43.310 --> 00:32:43.320 align:start position:0%
about that that would be a pretty
 
00:32:44.909 --> 00:32:44.919 align:start position:0%
cumbersome procedure in other words
 
00:32:47.509 --> 00:32:47.519 align:start position:0%
you'd have you know imagine if that were
 
00:32:49.830 --> 00:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
true imagine if that were true just
 
00:32:52.830 --> 00:32:52.840 align:start position:0%
throughout the administrative uh regime
 
00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
so that you know the department of admin
 
00:32:56.070 --> 00:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
of Environmental Services they're
 
00:32:57.830 --> 00:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
conducting an investigation they want
 
00:33:00.669 --> 00:33:00.679 align:start position:0%
want to get records um they have to go
 
00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:02.120 align:start position:0%
to the Attorney General's office to go
 
00:33:03.669 --> 00:33:03.679 align:start position:0%
to court to get the records or the
 
00:33:05.789 --> 00:33:05.799 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor or whatever it just
 
00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
seems like that is a kind of an
 
00:33:13.190 --> 00:33:13.200 align:start position:0%
awkward uh procedure to place any agency
 
00:33:14.789 --> 00:33:14.799 align:start position:0%
in where they're where they're
 
00:33:16.269 --> 00:33:16.279 align:start position:0%
conducting and have the authority to
 
00:33:18.430 --> 00:33:18.440 align:start position:0%
conduct their own
 
00:33:20.830 --> 00:33:20.840 align:start position:0%
investigations representative
 
00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
Burch thank you uh I notice and this I'm
 
00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:27.960 align:start position:0%
wondering if you would accept or or
 
00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
think it wise for an amendment I'm
 
00:33:34.950 --> 00:33:34.960 align:start position:0%
noticing in section f as you point out
 
00:33:38.789 --> 00:33:38.799 align:start position:0%
yeah a hearing officer May issue okay
 
00:33:43.269 --> 00:33:43.279 align:start position:0%
may or may not no standards if you go
 
00:33:49.549 --> 00:33:49.559 align:start position:0%
to uh section A right it's a shall issue
 
00:33:53.509 --> 00:33:53.519 align:start position:0%
with a few caveats it's got to be uh
 
00:33:57.870 --> 00:33:57.880 align:start position:0%
good faith and likely to be material
 
00:33:59.149 --> 00:33:59.159 align:start position:0%
would you
 
00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
have an objection to an
 
00:34:05.509 --> 00:34:05.519 align:start position:0%
amendment to
 
00:34:10.829 --> 00:34:10.839 align:start position:0%
F that changes the May issue to a shall
 
00:34:15.669 --> 00:34:15.679 align:start position:0%
issue uh under the same criteria earlier
 
00:34:18.589 --> 00:34:18.599 align:start position:0%
so that I mean I understand the hearing
 
00:34:20.829 --> 00:34:20.839 align:start position:0%
officer is part of the Department of
 
00:34:23.470 --> 00:34:23.480 align:start position:0%
Education and may just have a point of
 
00:34:27.869 --> 00:34:27.879 align:start position:0%
view about um relative merits in the law
 
00:34:31.710 --> 00:34:31.720 align:start position:0%
like a sh issue is more protective of
 
00:34:34.790 --> 00:34:34.800 align:start position:0%
the um I don't want to use the word
 
00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:37.560 align:start position:0%
accused but you know what I mean right
 
00:34:41.069 --> 00:34:41.079 align:start position:0%
uh rather than being may may get a
 
00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
subpoena issue may not without any
 
00:34:45.470 --> 00:34:45.480 align:start position:0%
standards you know what I guess what I
 
00:34:48.629 --> 00:34:48.639 align:start position:0%
would say to that is this I I would have
 
00:34:51.669 --> 00:34:51.679 align:start position:0%
no problem with changing the May to
 
00:34:54.470 --> 00:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
Shell if you could if you added language
 
00:34:56.790 --> 00:34:56.800 align:start position:0%
that said for example shell issue The
 
00:34:58.829 --> 00:34:58.839 align:start position:0%
subpoena for the ATT of witnesses or the
 
00:35:01.270 --> 00:35:01.280 align:start position:0%
production of books papers documents and
 
00:35:03.430 --> 00:35:03.440 align:start position:0%
other items uh on behalf of the
 
00:35:05.470 --> 00:35:05.480 align:start position:0%
Department of the Ed or the certified
 
00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:07.109 align:start position:0%
Department of the Ed or the certified
educator

00:35:07.109 --> 00:35:07.119 align:start position:0%
educator
 
00:35:10.190 --> 00:35:10.200 align:start position:0%
um I if we put language in there saying
 
00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:10.829 align:start position:0%
um I if we put language in there saying
you

00:35:10.829 --> 00:35:10.839 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:35:15.870 --> 00:35:15.880 align:start position:0%
know uh shell issues penis for materials
 
00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:19.200 align:start position:0%
uh relevant and material to the because
 
00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:21.720 align:start position:0%
I think I mean I actually think
 
00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
that if the the shell in subsection a
 
00:35:28.030 --> 00:35:28.040 align:start position:0%
with the with the two then caveat of
 
00:35:32.270 --> 00:35:32.280 align:start position:0%
what has to be shown is kind of the the
 
00:35:34.710 --> 00:35:34.720 align:start position:0%
equivalent of the may I mean it's not I
 
00:35:36.550 --> 00:35:36.560 align:start position:0%
agree it's not exactly the same but it
 
00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:41.200 align:start position:0%
does the the the caveats in one and two
 
00:35:44.069 --> 00:35:44.079 align:start position:0%
under subsection a are sort of turn the
 
00:35:47.230 --> 00:35:47.240 align:start position:0%
shell into shell as long as you satisfy
 
00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:48.270 align:start position:0%
shell into shell as long as you satisfy
these

00:35:48.270 --> 00:35:48.280 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:51.240 align:start position:0%
things I think that to me that's that's
 
00:35:53.790 --> 00:35:53.800 align:start position:0%
roughly the equivalent of the May in F
 
00:35:55.870 --> 00:35:55.880 align:start position:0%
but I wouldn't have a problem with
 
00:35:58.710 --> 00:35:58.720 align:start position:0%
changing it to Shell if you put it in
 
00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
it's got to be material and relevant
 
00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
because otherwise you can't have you
 
00:36:05.349 --> 00:36:05.359 align:start position:0%
know either side shouldn't be able to
 
00:36:07.870 --> 00:36:07.880 align:start position:0%
ask for a subpoena for just
 
00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:12.160 align:start position:0%
anything thank you representative
 
00:36:16.150 --> 00:36:16.160 align:start position:0%
beron thank you I was just curious
 
00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:18.160 align:start position:0%
because usually a school district or a
 
00:36:20.030 --> 00:36:20.040 align:start position:0%
school itself would be involved in this
 
00:36:24.109 --> 00:36:24.119 align:start position:0%
and I don't see anywhere here how or if
 
00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
they need to be communicated in in a
 
00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:28.240 align:start position:0%
certain way so I'm just
 
00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:30.560 align:start position:0%
I'm just confused if you know anything
 
00:36:32.349 --> 00:36:32.359 align:start position:0%
about the fact that where does a school
 
00:36:35.109 --> 00:36:35.119 align:start position:0%
district or a school whatnot fall in
 
00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:39.280 align:start position:0%
this but as I understand it the the the
 
00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
proceeding the credentialing
 
00:36:45.390 --> 00:36:45.400 align:start position:0%
investigation proceedings are directed
 
00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:48.640 align:start position:0%
against a credential educator um now
 
00:36:50.829 --> 00:36:50.839 align:start position:0%
obviously that person or I shouldn't say
 
00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:52.680 align:start position:0%
Obviously but in all likelihood that
 
00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
person works for a school district um
 
00:36:59.670 --> 00:36:59.680 align:start position:0%
the you know and presumably one of the
 
00:37:02.069 --> 00:37:02.079 align:start position:0%
one of the likely places I would think
 
00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
that a subpoena particularly for books
 
00:37:06.430 --> 00:37:06.440 align:start position:0%
and records and you know other kind of
 
00:37:08.710 --> 00:37:08.720 align:start position:0%
things might be issued would be to the
 
00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
school district so that's you know I
 
00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
think they the way that they would be
 
00:37:14.710 --> 00:37:14.720 align:start position:0%
involved is if the
 
00:37:16.910 --> 00:37:16.920 align:start position:0%
subpoena um was issued to the school
 
00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:18.720 align:start position:0%
district to produce certain books or
 
00:37:22.069 --> 00:37:22.079 align:start position:0%
records or um uh you know payroll
 
00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
records or whatever uh curricular
 
00:37:26.950 --> 00:37:26.960 align:start position:0%
records or something like that I I would
 
00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:28.240 align:start position:0%
assume that then the school district
 
00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:30.760 align:start position:0%
would be involved in that
 
00:37:33.950 --> 00:37:33.960 align:start position:0%
way thank you any other
 
00:37:38.589 --> 00:37:38.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:58.510 --> 00:37:58.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um members of the
 
00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
committee uh for the record my name is
 
00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
Brian Hawkins I'm here representing Nea
 
00:38:09.150 --> 00:38:09.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um we represent um
 
00:38:11.829 --> 00:38:11.839 align:start position:0%
thousands of Educators across the state
 
00:38:15.230 --> 00:38:15.240 align:start position:0%
um in collective bargaining and and um
 
00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:18.560 align:start position:0%
and some in these sorts of proceedings
 
00:38:21.270 --> 00:38:21.280 align:start position:0%
um although I'm not I don't conduct
 
00:38:24.750 --> 00:38:24.760 align:start position:0%
these uh representations myself I'll do
 
00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:26.640 align:start position:0%
my best to answer any questions that you
 
00:38:29.270 --> 00:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
have after testimony and if I can't
 
00:38:30.670 --> 00:38:30.680 align:start position:0%
answer them I'd be happy to get you the
 
00:38:33.589 --> 00:38:33.599 align:start position:0%
answers to those um but this is I think
 
00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
the third time uh We've uh had a similar
 
00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
bill in the last few years we are still
 
00:38:43.710 --> 00:38:43.720 align:start position:0%
here in opposition to the bill um we
 
00:38:46.069 --> 00:38:46.079 align:start position:0%
feel first uh the first question the
 
00:38:48.309 --> 00:38:48.319 align:start position:0%
committee should answer before before
 
00:38:50.190 --> 00:38:50.200 align:start position:0%
even examining the language of this bill
 
00:38:52.910 --> 00:38:52.920 align:start position:0%
ought to be um is it necessary for the
 
00:38:54.589 --> 00:38:54.599 align:start position:0%
commissioner of Education or the
 
00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
00:38:58.069 --> 00:38:58.079 align:start position:0%
Education uh to be able to obtain
 
00:39:00.829 --> 00:39:00.839 align:start position:0%
subpoena Authority uh to properly carry
 
00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
out their charge under the New Hampshire
 
00:39:06.030 --> 00:39:06.040 align:start position:0%
educator code of conduct um and as was
 
00:39:10.470 --> 00:39:10.480 align:start position:0%
noted earlier uh in subcommittees in
 
00:39:14.030 --> 00:39:14.040 align:start position:0%
hearings um the department has
 
00:39:16.230 --> 00:39:16.240 align:start position:0%
consistently told the legislature each
 
00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:18.560 align:start position:0%
time uh the issue has come before you
 
00:39:20.309 --> 00:39:20.319 align:start position:0%
that the authority was a prospective
 
00:39:22.309 --> 00:39:22.319 align:start position:0%
need if there were documents that a
 
00:39:24.230 --> 00:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
school district simply would not allow
 
00:39:26.829 --> 00:39:26.839 align:start position:0%
them access to um the question of
 
00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:28.720 align:start position:0%
whether there documents not being made
 
00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:31.560 align:start position:0%
available to them was asked uh in as I
 
00:39:33.829 --> 00:39:33.839 align:start position:0%
said a retain Bill subcommittee meeting
 
00:39:33.839 --> 00:39:34.910 align:start position:0%
said a retain Bill subcommittee meeting
follow-up

00:39:34.910 --> 00:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:39:37.470 --> 00:39:37.480 align:start position:0%
conversations and um the bill heard last
 
00:39:39.710 --> 00:39:39.720 align:start position:0%
year in committee the as far as I could
 
00:39:42.309 --> 00:39:42.319 align:start position:0%
tell and I I'm happy to be corrected the
 
00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
answer was still no um and there was not
 
00:39:47.790 --> 00:39:47.800 align:start position:0%
anything that the department could not
 
00:39:50.309 --> 00:39:50.319 align:start position:0%
view in determining whether to recommend
 
00:39:53.309 --> 00:39:53.319 align:start position:0%
whether a violation had occurred uh and
 
00:39:57.630 --> 00:39:57.640 align:start position:0%
and a punishment was warranted um so and
 
00:40:00.430 --> 00:40:00.440 align:start position:0%
to to the bill itself uh we still feel
 
00:40:05.069 --> 00:40:05.079 align:start position:0%
that this is um fundamentally unfair um
 
00:40:09.430 --> 00:40:09.440 align:start position:0%
with respect to um uh credential holders
 
00:40:15.470 --> 00:40:15.480 align:start position:0%
uh due process rights um and um first I
 
00:40:17.069 --> 00:40:17.079 align:start position:0%
I'll bring up a couple points on this
 
00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
first the department essentially is
 
00:40:20.950 --> 00:40:20.960 align:start position:0%
asking for the ability to issue
 
00:40:24.150 --> 00:40:24.160 align:start position:0%
subpoenas to solicit information during
 
00:40:26.910 --> 00:40:26.920 align:start position:0%
investigations uh yet as was again noted
 
00:40:28.470 --> 00:40:28.480 align:start position:0%
earlier there was no Provisions that
 
00:40:31.910 --> 00:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
this uh subject educator may also issue
 
00:40:33.990 --> 00:40:34.000 align:start position:0%
subpoenas which would assist in their
 
00:40:36.790 --> 00:40:36.800 align:start position:0%
defense during the investigation period
 
00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
I think that's important partly because
 
00:40:41.470 --> 00:40:41.480 align:start position:0%
um as I've been told the experience here
 
00:40:43.710 --> 00:40:43.720 align:start position:0%
is the investigatory
 
00:40:46.309 --> 00:40:46.319 align:start position:0%
phase uh that this rarely gets to an
 
00:40:50.750 --> 00:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
adjud adjudicatory phase and so um most
 
00:40:53.470 --> 00:40:53.480 align:start position:0%
often that is the phase that we are
 
00:40:54.790 --> 00:40:54.800 align:start position:0%
talking about and so when you're talking
 
00:40:57.510 --> 00:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
about being able to uh have the
 
00:40:59.630 --> 00:40:59.640 align:start position:0%
information necessary to make decisions
 
00:41:01.950 --> 00:41:01.960 align:start position:0%
about uh whether you're going to accept
 
00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:02.870 align:start position:0%
about uh whether you're going to accept
a

00:41:02.870 --> 00:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:41:05.270 --> 00:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
recommended um sanction from the
 
00:41:07.430 --> 00:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
Department um having all of that
 
00:41:09.349 --> 00:41:09.359 align:start position:0%
information is critical to the
 
00:41:12.109 --> 00:41:12.119 align:start position:0%
credential holder um in the rules I
 
00:41:14.109 --> 00:41:14.119 align:start position:0%
don't have the specific timeline in
 
00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:16.160 align:start position:0%
front of me but there is a there is a
 
00:41:18.589 --> 00:41:18.599 align:start position:0%
prescribed timeline that an edge care
 
00:41:21.430 --> 00:41:21.440 align:start position:0%
has to make that decision um that
 
00:41:25.349 --> 00:41:25.359 align:start position:0%
involves their career uh as to uh and
 
00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
and having uh
 
00:41:31.950 --> 00:41:31.960 align:start position:0%
an adequate amount of time to uh and
 
00:41:33.790 --> 00:41:33.800 align:start position:0%
information to make that decision is
 
00:41:36.510 --> 00:41:36.520 align:start position:0%
really critical um and so that's one of
 
00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:38.040 align:start position:0%
the areas where I think that it's not
 
00:41:40.309 --> 00:41:40.319 align:start position:0%
necessarily an Apples to Apples just
 
00:41:42.589 --> 00:41:42.599 align:start position:0%
because one state has subpoena Authority
 
00:41:46.150 --> 00:41:46.160 align:start position:0%
for their their education department um
 
00:41:49.470 --> 00:41:49.480 align:start position:0%
we should too the the processes are are
 
00:41:51.030 --> 00:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
are different the experience is
 
00:41:53.470 --> 00:41:53.480 align:start position:0%
different and so
 
00:41:59.150 --> 00:41:59.160 align:start position:0%
um so um the the
 
00:42:00.349 --> 00:42:00.359 align:start position:0%
and and and the department of course
 
00:42:02.069 --> 00:42:02.079 align:start position:0%
will have all that information well
 
00:42:05.950 --> 00:42:05.960 align:start position:0%
beforehand so as before uh the language
 
00:42:08.950 --> 00:42:08.960 align:start position:0%
uh is not restrictive to certain code of
 
00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:09.950 align:start position:0%
uh is not restrictive to certain code of
conduct

00:42:09.950 --> 00:42:09.960 align:start position:0%
conduct
 
00:42:13.309 --> 00:42:13.319 align:start position:0%
violations um and subpoenas in the
 
00:42:15.510 --> 00:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
investigatory phase based on these
 
00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:18.880 align:start position:0%
standards um brings us back to concerns
 
00:42:21.430 --> 00:42:21.440 align:start position:0%
about how broad they are uh you know for
 
00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:24.400 align:start position:0%
example um in the
 
00:42:27.510 --> 00:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
criteria um that for the hearings office
 
00:42:32.069 --> 00:42:32.079 align:start position:0%
it states that um the material would be
 
00:42:35.829 --> 00:42:35.839 align:start position:0%
reason reasonably likely to be material
 
00:42:38.230 --> 00:42:38.240 align:start position:0%
and we think that's broad um and so
 
00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:39.720 align:start position:0%
we're concerned that that could mean
 
00:42:40.910 --> 00:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
anything and
 
00:42:45.270 --> 00:42:45.280 align:start position:0%
everything um I'll close with just some
 
00:42:49.790 --> 00:42:49.800 align:start position:0%
context for this legislative session um
 
00:42:53.069 --> 00:42:53.079 align:start position:0%
last year we were also part of the
 
00:42:54.549 --> 00:42:54.559 align:start position:0%
reason we were concerned about adding
 
00:42:57.430 --> 00:42:57.440 align:start position:0%
this authority to the Departments was
 
00:42:59.750 --> 00:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
because there was a simultaneous process
 
00:43:02.790 --> 00:43:02.800 align:start position:0%
going on to change the rules the
 
00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
investigatory proceedings and procedures
 
00:43:07.069 --> 00:43:07.079 align:start position:0%
under the code of conduct through the
 
00:43:10.549 --> 00:43:10.559 align:start position:0%
rulemaking process um and so we were we
 
00:43:13.230 --> 00:43:13.240 align:start position:0%
were doing two
 
00:43:15.349 --> 00:43:15.359 align:start position:0%
simultaneous processes one we were
 
00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:17.640 align:start position:0%
changing the rules and then we were also
 
00:43:21.990 --> 00:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
adding this additional Authority um and
 
00:43:23.870 --> 00:43:23.880 align:start position:0%
you know at that point we didn't know
 
00:43:25.710 --> 00:43:25.720 align:start position:0%
what Authority we were adding for
 
00:43:27.670 --> 00:43:27.680 align:start position:0%
subpoenas we were adding to
 
00:43:29.150 --> 00:43:29.160 align:start position:0%
uh what process we were adding that
 
00:43:32.510 --> 00:43:32.520 align:start position:0%
authority to so um but this year uh I
 
00:43:34.349 --> 00:43:34.359 align:start position:0%
think there it's important for the
 
00:43:36.670 --> 00:43:36.680 align:start position:0%
committee to understand there there's
 
00:43:41.230 --> 00:43:41.240 align:start position:0%
also several uh attempts to expand the
 
00:43:43.549 --> 00:43:43.559 align:start position:0%
educator code of conduct going on in
 
00:43:46.069 --> 00:43:46.079 align:start position:0%
other committees and so um I think
 
00:43:47.790 --> 00:43:47.800 align:start position:0%
that's important when you're talking
 
00:43:50.349 --> 00:43:50.359 align:start position:0%
about broadening the scope of the code
 
00:43:54.190 --> 00:43:54.200 align:start position:0%
of conduct um across the hall um where I
 
00:43:56.309 --> 00:43:56.319 align:start position:0%
spent a lot more time than in the
 
00:43:57.990 --> 00:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee
 
00:44:01.349 --> 00:44:01.359 align:start position:0%
um the house bill 235 would allow the
 
00:44:04.309 --> 00:44:04.319 align:start position:0%
State Board to write uh an entirely new
 
00:44:06.349 --> 00:44:06.359 align:start position:0%
category of unnamed responsibilities to
 
00:44:07.349 --> 00:44:07.359 align:start position:0%
the code of
 
00:44:07.359 --> 00:44:09.430 align:start position:0%
the code of
conduct

00:44:09.430 --> 00:44:09.440 align:start position:0%
conduct
 
00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
um Senate Bill 96 uh being heard in the
 
00:44:16.549 --> 00:44:16.559 align:start position:0%
Senate uh around mandatory disclosure
 
00:44:19.309 --> 00:44:19.319 align:start position:0%
also contains subjective and vague
 
00:44:21.790 --> 00:44:21.800 align:start position:0%
standards for divulging information in
 
00:44:24.390 --> 00:44:24.400 align:start position:0%
response to written inquiries um and
 
00:44:26.349 --> 00:44:26.359 align:start position:0%
that bill also contains language saying
 
00:44:28.390 --> 00:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
it must be add to the educator code of
 
00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:30.160 align:start position:0%
conduct and be considered a violation of
 
00:44:34.870 --> 00:44:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:38.790 --> 00:44:38.800 align:start position:0%
um for those reasons we have a concern
 
00:44:43.549 --> 00:44:43.559 align:start position:0%
that this um that this bill is as I said
 
00:44:46.390 --> 00:44:46.400 align:start position:0%
unnecessary um and I I would urge the
 
00:44:48.589 --> 00:44:48.599 align:start position:0%
committee to also look at those other
 
00:44:50.630 --> 00:44:50.640 align:start position:0%
factors when considering whether we need
 
00:44:55.270 --> 00:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
to uh Grant this Authority uh when we're
 
00:44:56.670 --> 00:44:56.680 align:start position:0%
not sure what kind of educator code of
 
00:44:58.069 --> 00:44:58.079 align:start position:0%
conduct we're even talking about by the
 
00:45:02.109 --> 00:45:02.119 align:start position:0%
end of the session so um I'll close with
 
00:45:03.790 --> 00:45:03.800 align:start position:0%
that and happy to take any questions
 
00:45:05.549 --> 00:45:05.559 align:start position:0%
that I can okay so I guess I have a
 
00:45:09.150 --> 00:45:09.160 align:start position:0%
question yep um as far as subpoena power
 
00:45:12.309 --> 00:45:12.319 align:start position:0%
for both the Department of Education and
 
00:45:15.109 --> 00:45:15.119 align:start position:0%
the respondant it sounded like from your
 
00:45:16.309 --> 00:45:16.319 align:start position:0%
testimony you
 
00:45:19.510 --> 00:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
agree that subpoena power is important
 
00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:22.480 align:start position:0%
critical to get accurate and thorough
 
00:45:24.150 --> 00:45:24.160 align:start position:0%
information however you want it for both
 
00:45:25.710 --> 00:45:25.720 align:start position:0%
parties but it sounds like you agree
 
00:45:27.309 --> 00:45:27.319 align:start position:0%
that that's critical though to that
 
00:45:28.710 --> 00:45:28.720 align:start position:0%
power yeah thank thank you for the
 
00:45:33.150 --> 00:45:33.160 align:start position:0%
question I um and if uh it let me
 
00:45:36.470 --> 00:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
clarify um I don't think that this is a
 
00:45:38.589 --> 00:45:38.599 align:start position:0%
necessary power for the Department to
 
00:45:42.950 --> 00:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
have um I my comments about both sides
 
00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
really had to do with uh within the
 
00:45:49.910 --> 00:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
context of this specific Bill not uh
 
00:45:52.270 --> 00:45:52.280 align:start position:0%
generally whether that power is
 
00:45:55.670 --> 00:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
necessary representative Perez thank you
 
00:45:57.270 --> 00:45:57.280 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my questions I have
 
00:45:59.589 --> 00:45:59.599 align:start position:0%
two quick questions I'm going to give a
 
00:46:01.790 --> 00:46:01.800 align:start position:0%
two second thing I was a registered
 
00:46:04.109 --> 00:46:04.119 align:start position:0%
nurse who had a license and I was
 
00:46:09.710 --> 00:46:09.720 align:start position:0%
subpoena twice to speak in um an
 
00:46:12.230 --> 00:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
incident that occurred with another
 
00:46:15.589 --> 00:46:15.599 align:start position:0%
nurse um and I don't I wonder why you
 
00:46:19.069 --> 00:46:19.079 align:start position:0%
think that's any different and my second
 
00:46:21.589 --> 00:46:21.599 align:start position:0%
question is have you heard of
 
00:46:25.589 --> 00:46:25.599 align:start position:0%
sealed um sealed what do you call them
 
00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
on something sealed sealed
 
00:46:32.069 --> 00:46:32.079 align:start position:0%
documents uh where um in uh uh something
 
00:46:36.470 --> 00:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
has come up in you know in a school with
 
00:46:40.829 --> 00:46:40.839 align:start position:0%
a an educator or an employee and they
 
00:46:42.950 --> 00:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
have been given and and in businesses
 
00:46:45.750 --> 00:46:45.760 align:start position:0%
where they have been given the option of
 
00:46:49.030 --> 00:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
well you have a choice we'll either fire
 
00:46:53.349 --> 00:46:53.359 align:start position:0%
you or you can quit and we will seal the
 
00:46:56.109 --> 00:46:56.119 align:start position:0%
documents the complaint those are my two
 
00:46:58.589 --> 00:46:58.599 align:start position:0%
questions thank you
 
00:46:58.599 --> 00:47:00.470 align:start position:0%
questions thank you
sure

00:47:00.470 --> 00:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:47:03.430 --> 00:47:03.440 align:start position:0%
um well uh taking the second one first I
 
00:47:05.549 --> 00:47:05.559 align:start position:0%
mean I I am familiar that sometimes in
 
00:47:07.910 --> 00:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
employment situations you have those
 
00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:08.790 align:start position:0%
employment situations you have those
sorts

00:47:08.790 --> 00:47:08.800 align:start position:0%
sorts
 
00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
of uh Arrangements I know there have
 
00:47:12.750 --> 00:47:12.760 align:start position:0%
been bills that
 
00:47:15.910 --> 00:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
specifically uh deal with that but um
 
00:47:18.430 --> 00:47:18.440 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that
 
00:47:22.270 --> 00:47:22.280 align:start position:0%
it's necessarily relevant to this bill
 
00:47:26.190 --> 00:47:26.200 align:start position:0%
although I would say you know um it at
 
00:47:28.309 --> 00:47:28.319 align:start position:0%
least as I can it it doesn't seem as
 
00:47:31.870 --> 00:47:31.880 align:start position:0%
though there is um I think there's a
 
00:47:33.950 --> 00:47:33.960 align:start position:0%
question about what could be subpoenaed
 
00:47:37.069 --> 00:47:37.079 align:start position:0%
here so you know whether that's included
 
00:47:39.470 --> 00:47:39.480 align:start position:0%
whether you're talking about any uh are
 
00:47:43.309 --> 00:47:43.319 align:start position:0%
there um items that are exempt under 91a
 
00:47:46.030 --> 00:47:46.040 align:start position:0%
from disclosure that are also being able
 
00:47:48.349 --> 00:47:48.359 align:start position:0%
to be subpoenaed um I think that's
 
00:47:51.190 --> 00:47:51.200 align:start position:0%
unclear from the bill um and then to the
 
00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
to the uh question around
 
00:47:57.349 --> 00:47:57.359 align:start position:0%
other uh professional license with the
 
00:48:01.270 --> 00:48:01.280 align:start position:0%
nurse um I think that it's a different
 
00:48:04.990 --> 00:48:05.000 align:start position:0%
um situation here uh there was Authority
 
00:48:07.829 --> 00:48:07.839 align:start position:0%
granted to um I guess in that case it
 
00:48:10.710 --> 00:48:10.720 align:start position:0%
would be oplc or Board of Nursing I
 
00:48:13.790 --> 00:48:13.800 align:start position:0%
guess um uh not to the Department of
 
00:48:17.349 --> 00:48:17.359 align:start position:0%
Education I think if anything the track
 
00:48:20.950 --> 00:48:20.960 align:start position:0%
record in the last several years um and
 
00:48:22.710 --> 00:48:22.720 align:start position:0%
Beyond I think should give pause about
 
00:48:25.990 --> 00:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
whether we're um allowing a a an
 
00:48:28.630 --> 00:48:28.640 align:start position:0%
innately in at times political
 
00:48:30.589 --> 00:48:30.599 align:start position:0%
Department to to to be able to issue
 
00:48:33.030 --> 00:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
subpoenas and I know that I Pro I know a
 
00:48:34.549 --> 00:48:34.559 align:start position:0%
lot of you probably won't agree with
 
00:48:37.630 --> 00:48:37.640 align:start position:0%
that um but uh I think that's a reason
 
00:48:40.190 --> 00:48:40.200 align:start position:0%
to to give pause about whether you um
 
00:48:42.190 --> 00:48:42.200 align:start position:0%
ought to Grant this
 
00:48:45.069 --> 00:48:45.079 align:start position:0%
Authority followup what do you mean by
 
00:48:49.470 --> 00:48:49.480 align:start position:0%
track record well I I mean I I'll be
 
00:48:55.549 --> 00:48:55.559 align:start position:0%
happy to share the the um you know there
 
00:48:58.630 --> 00:48:58.640 align:start position:0%
was a story not not long ago about um
 
00:49:01.589 --> 00:49:01.599 align:start position:0%
the track record of the commissioner and
 
00:49:05.270 --> 00:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
the use of authority to um drive a
 
00:49:07.910 --> 00:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
certain agenda and so I I don't think
 
00:49:11.589 --> 00:49:11.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:14.950 --> 00:49:14.960 align:start position:0%
um I I think that that should give the
 
00:49:17.870 --> 00:49:17.880 align:start position:0%
committee pause when it comes to
 
00:49:20.789 --> 00:49:20.799 align:start position:0%
subpoena Authority one but two when it
 
00:49:22.510 --> 00:49:22.520 align:start position:0%
comes to subpoena Authority and any code
 
00:49:25.030 --> 00:49:25.040 align:start position:0%
of conduct violation like I said when
 
00:49:27.910 --> 00:49:27.920 align:start position:0%
there are numerous bill ills the session
 
00:49:32.670 --> 00:49:32.680 align:start position:0%
that are proposing to expand the code of
 
00:49:34.950 --> 00:49:34.960 align:start position:0%
conduct might I for the record say that
 
00:49:36.710 --> 00:49:36.720 align:start position:0%
I feel that that was a very
 
00:49:39.870 --> 00:49:39.880 align:start position:0%
inappropriate um remark bringing up the
 
00:49:43.390 --> 00:49:43.400 align:start position:0%
the uh track record of the Department of
 
00:49:45.630 --> 00:49:45.640 align:start position:0%
Education yeah we don't really speak
 
00:49:48.829 --> 00:49:48.839 align:start position:0%
about motives but uh representative uh
 
00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
Morton thank you thank you for the
 
00:49:53.030 --> 00:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
question and um when we talk about track
 
00:49:54.470 --> 00:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
records I'm not going to look at the
 
00:49:56.829 --> 00:49:56.839 align:start position:0%
test scores that we have in the state um
 
00:50:01.150 --> 00:50:01.160 align:start position:0%
that being said um as far as uh my
 
00:50:03.789 --> 00:50:03.799 align:start position:0%
career I'm regulated by the insurance
 
00:50:05.470 --> 00:50:05.480 align:start position:0%
department here in the state and
 
00:50:07.630 --> 00:50:07.640 align:start position:0%
regulated by the SEC and the
 
00:50:11.990 --> 00:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
FDC why shouldn't Educators be shouldn't
 
00:50:14.069 --> 00:50:14.079 align:start position:0%
there be better oversight well the
 
00:50:17.230 --> 00:50:17.240 align:start position:0%
educators are regulated under um well
 
00:50:18.630 --> 00:50:18.640 align:start position:0%
not saying that they're not regulated
 
00:50:20.069 --> 00:50:20.079 align:start position:0%
but why shouldn't there be better
 
00:50:22.390 --> 00:50:22.400 align:start position:0%
oversight CU that's what this is
 
00:50:24.910 --> 00:50:24.920 align:start position:0%
about I mean you spoke for about 5
 
00:50:29.950 --> 00:50:29.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:30.990 --> 00:50:31.000 align:start position:0%
not I'm not sure there's a question
 
00:50:34.390 --> 00:50:34.400 align:start position:0%
there Mr chairman and so I'll okay
 
00:50:38.589 --> 00:50:38.599 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Vice chair and thank you
 
00:50:42.910 --> 00:50:42.920 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um you spoke
 
00:50:45.870 --> 00:50:45.880 align:start position:0%
about pending changes to the rules of
 
00:50:48.510 --> 00:50:48.520 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education and as I was
 
00:50:50.829 --> 00:50:50.839 align:start position:0%
wondering whether um those rules have
 
00:50:53.349 --> 00:50:53.359 align:start position:0%
been finalized and whether any of them
 
00:50:56.349 --> 00:50:56.359 align:start position:0%
impact the issuance of subpoenas or any
 
00:50:57.829 --> 00:50:57.839 align:start position:0%
of the the issues that we're dealing
 
00:50:57.839 --> 00:50:58.589 align:start position:0%
of the the issues that we're dealing
with

00:50:58.589 --> 00:50:58.599 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:51:02.349 --> 00:51:02.359 align:start position:0%
here um there there there was a fi
 
00:51:05.069 --> 00:51:05.079 align:start position:0%
finalized rules uh changes in the
 
00:51:06.470 --> 00:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
investigatory process that were
 
00:51:08.630 --> 00:51:08.640 align:start position:0%
finalized last year I'd be happy to send
 
00:51:11.950 --> 00:51:11.960 align:start position:0%
those uh to the committee uh they dealed
 
00:51:15.390 --> 00:51:15.400 align:start position:0%
with a variety of issues from timelines
 
00:51:21.030 --> 00:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
to uh you know notice around um uh to
 
00:51:23.950 --> 00:51:23.960 align:start position:0%
the credential holder when they're under
 
00:51:27.789 --> 00:51:27.799 align:start position:0%
investigation um and you know
 
00:51:29.990 --> 00:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
what the
 
00:51:33.270 --> 00:51:33.280 align:start position:0%
uh what that notice needed to include
 
00:51:35.109 --> 00:51:35.119 align:start position:0%
when if they are placed under an
 
00:51:37.829 --> 00:51:37.839 align:start position:0%
official investigation um so it it deal
 
00:51:42.190 --> 00:51:42.200 align:start position:0%
with a variety I think they are uh in
 
00:51:44.750 --> 00:51:44.760 align:start position:0%
some cases connected and some cases you
 
00:51:49.190 --> 00:51:49.200 align:start position:0%
know indirectly um to uh to The subpoena
 
00:51:51.190 --> 00:51:51.200 align:start position:0%
Authority any other questions
 
00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:53.109 align:start position:0%
Authority any other questions
representative

00:51:53.109 --> 00:51:53.119 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:51:57.390 --> 00:51:57.400 align:start position:0%
Bergeron thank you Mr co-chair Mr chair
 
00:51:58.710 --> 00:51:58.720 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to ask you a question
 
00:52:00.230 --> 00:52:00.240 align:start position:0%
because I know that you've been
 
00:52:04.150 --> 00:52:04.160 align:start position:0%
in a lot of Education um settings but at
 
00:52:05.910 --> 00:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
this point I had asked earlier the fact
 
00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:07.200 align:start position:0%
that I was a little bothered where it
 
00:52:09.109 --> 00:52:09.119 align:start position:0%
doesn't have anything here about a
 
00:52:12.030 --> 00:52:12.040 align:start position:0%
school or a school district I just I
 
00:52:14.230 --> 00:52:14.240 align:start position:0%
guess I'm ba based on your opinion and
 
00:52:16.270 --> 00:52:16.280 align:start position:0%
what you're reading here do you feel
 
00:52:19.030 --> 00:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
that's a critical step to actually have
 
00:52:21.910 --> 00:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
in here as far as the responsibility of
 
00:52:26.270 --> 00:52:26.280 align:start position:0%
a district like for example sure um so
 
00:52:26.280 --> 00:52:27.430 align:start position:0%
a district like for example sure um so
um

00:52:27.430 --> 00:52:27.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:29.670 --> 00:52:29.680 align:start position:0%
there there may be other uh you know
 
00:52:31.630 --> 00:52:31.640 align:start position:0%
Witnesses coming up who can speak
 
00:52:33.589 --> 00:52:33.599 align:start position:0%
directly from the school district uh
 
00:52:37.030 --> 00:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
point of view um when I send you the
 
00:52:39.589 --> 00:52:39.599 align:start position:0%
investigatory rules I I do believe that
 
00:52:43.470 --> 00:52:43.480 align:start position:0%
they're it speaks to uh you know there
 
00:52:45.390 --> 00:52:45.400 align:start position:0%
are Provisions about notice when when
 
00:52:48.230 --> 00:52:48.240 align:start position:0%
someone is under investigation notice to
 
00:52:50.349 --> 00:52:50.359 align:start position:0%
the to the school that that that
 
00:52:52.589 --> 00:52:52.599 align:start position:0%
credential holder is under
 
00:52:54.870 --> 00:52:54.880 align:start position:0%
investigation um but off the top of my
 
00:52:57.789 --> 00:52:57.799 align:start position:0%
head I wouldn't be able to give you a
 
00:53:00.589 --> 00:53:00.599 align:start position:0%
comprehensive uh view of the of all the
 
00:53:02.309 --> 00:53:02.319 align:start position:0%
rules that speak specifically to the
 
00:53:06.430 --> 00:53:06.440 align:start position:0%
school district's I'm just asking rle if
 
00:53:08.789 --> 00:53:08.799 align:start position:0%
follow if you think that's a good
 
00:53:11.829 --> 00:53:11.839 align:start position:0%
idea um I I to actually have it that's
 
00:53:13.589 --> 00:53:13.599 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying yeah I I I think the
 
00:53:17.589 --> 00:53:17.599 align:start position:0%
more clear you make any law the the
 
00:53:19.750 --> 00:53:19.760 align:start position:0%

Education it is my hope today to answer
 
00:53:52.270 --> 00:53:52.280 align:start position:0%
some of the questions that were raised
 
00:53:56.430 --> 00:53:56.440 align:start position:0%
um so in the first instance uh thank you
 
00:53:57.750 --> 00:53:57.760 align:start position:0%
than you for your consideration of this
 
00:53:59.950 --> 00:53:59.960 align:start position:0%
bill I know it's been brought forward
 
00:54:02.470 --> 00:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
many times it is very important to the
 
00:54:04.630 --> 00:54:04.640 align:start position:0%
Department of Education uh for this
 
00:54:06.589 --> 00:54:06.599 align:start position:0%
committee to consider our requests to
 
00:54:09.190 --> 00:54:09.200 align:start position:0%
have subpoena power we are doing so to
 
00:54:11.309 --> 00:54:11.319 align:start position:0%
be proactive in our
 
00:54:13.670 --> 00:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
investigations um the department does
 
00:54:15.910 --> 00:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
have limited Authority and limited
 
00:54:23.150 --> 00:54:23.160 align:start position:0%
oversight of schools but in RSA 21 N9
 
00:54:24.789 --> 00:54:24.799 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to repeat that legal
 
00:54:26.589 --> 00:54:26.599 align:start position:0%
reference I am an attorney and I can't
 
00:54:28.150 --> 00:54:28.160 align:start position:0%
stand when people just throw me legal
 
00:54:33.510 --> 00:54:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:37.390 --> 00:54:37.400 align:start position:0%
N9 it sets forth the rulle making
 
00:54:39.430 --> 00:54:39.440 align:start position:0%
Authority now the Department of
 
00:54:41.750 --> 00:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
Education is different from a lot of
 
00:54:44.829 --> 00:54:44.839 align:start position:0%
other state agencies in that the
 
00:54:47.069 --> 00:54:47.079 align:start position:0%
department itself does not have rul
 
00:54:49.950 --> 00:54:49.960 align:start position:0%
making Authority it is the Board of
 
00:54:52.630 --> 00:54:52.640 align:start position:0%
Education that has the ru making
 
00:54:57.510 --> 00:54:57.520 align:start position:0%
Authority so when you look at RSA 21 N9
 
00:55:00.309 --> 00:55:00.319 align:start position:0%
it says rul making for the Board of
 
00:55:03.390 --> 00:55:03.400 align:start position:0%
Education shall adopt rules in these
 
00:55:06.309 --> 00:55:06.319 align:start position:0%
various areas and if you look at the
 
00:55:09.829 --> 00:55:09.839 align:start position:0%
very end of the statute it is Roman
 
00:55:09.839 --> 00:55:12.069 align:start position:0%
very end of the statute it is Roman
numeral

00:55:12.069 --> 00:55:12.079 align:start position:0%
numeral
 
00:55:15.150 --> 00:55:15.160 align:start position:0%
2 Double little
 
00:55:15.160 --> 00:55:17.270 align:start position:0%
2 Double little
c

00:55:17.270 --> 00:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
c
 
00:55:22.870 --> 00:55:22.880 align:start position:0%
one so 21 N9 Roman numeral
 
00:55:27.549 --> 00:55:27.559 align:start position:0%
2 Double little c one see I wish I had a
 
00:55:29.829 --> 00:55:29.839 align:start position:0%
whiteboard so I can write it up here but
 
00:55:32.029 --> 00:55:32.039 align:start position:0%
I am not an educator I'm an attorney so
 
00:55:33.430 --> 00:55:33.440 align:start position:0%
please forgive
 
00:55:36.910 --> 00:55:36.920 align:start position:0%
me but that is where House
 
00:55:40.549 --> 00:55:40.559 align:start position:0%
Education established the department um
 
00:55:43.750 --> 00:55:43.760 align:start position:0%
The Establishment and enforcement of a
 
00:55:46.710 --> 00:55:46.720 align:start position:0%
code of ethics and code of conduct for
 
00:55:49.430 --> 00:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
licensed or certified
 
00:55:52.270 --> 00:55:52.280 align:start position:0%
Educators there was a question whether a
 
00:55:54.230 --> 00:55:54.240 align:start position:0%
licensed or certified educator could be
 
00:55:56.430 --> 00:55:56.440 align:start position:0%
in a a private school or we call
 
00:55:58.829 --> 00:55:58.839 align:start position:0%
non-public school the answer to that is
 
00:56:02.029 --> 00:56:02.039 align:start position:0%
yes they could be there is a question as
 
00:56:04.270 --> 00:56:04.280 align:start position:0%
to whether or not this U applies to
 
00:56:07.950 --> 00:56:07.960 align:start position:0%
higher education no it does
 
00:56:10.589 --> 00:56:10.599 align:start position:0%
not there is a question as to whether or
 
00:56:12.549 --> 00:56:12.559 align:start position:0%
not licensed or certified Educators
 
00:56:15.549 --> 00:56:15.559 align:start position:0%
could be in charter schools yes they
 
00:56:18.029 --> 00:56:18.039 align:start position:0%
could be charter schools are not
 
00:56:20.470 --> 00:56:20.480 align:start position:0%
required to have everyone be a licensed
 
00:56:22.150 --> 00:56:22.160 align:start position:0%
or certified educator but they do have
 
00:56:24.230 --> 00:56:24.240 align:start position:0%
to have a certain number so we could get
 
00:56:26.349 --> 00:56:26.359 align:start position:0%
a call from a charter school and the
 
00:56:29.549 --> 00:56:29.559 align:start position:0%
person could be an unlicensed
 
00:56:31.549 --> 00:56:31.559 align:start position:0%
educator we could get a call from a
 
00:56:34.150 --> 00:56:34.160 align:start position:0%
charter school and the person could be a
 
00:56:34.160 --> 00:56:36.029 align:start position:0%
charter school and the person could be a
licensed

00:56:36.029 --> 00:56:36.039 align:start position:0%
licensed
 
00:56:39.950 --> 00:56:39.960 align:start position:0%
educator and it within this rul making
 
00:56:42.990 --> 00:56:43.000 align:start position:0%
Authority again not Authority by the
 
00:56:45.670 --> 00:56:45.680 align:start position:0%
Department of Education but the Board of
 
00:56:48.670 --> 00:56:48.680 align:start position:0%
Education they set forth these
 
00:56:50.990 --> 00:56:51.000 align:start position:0%
professional codes shall include a
 
00:56:53.029 --> 00:56:53.039 align:start position:0%
statement of purpose and standards
 
00:56:54.990 --> 00:56:55.000 align:start position:0%
defining each of the four primary
 
00:56:58.990 --> 00:56:59.000 align:start position:0%
principles and they set forth four
 
00:57:01.630 --> 00:57:01.640 align:start position:0%
principles when the department with
 
00:57:03.349 --> 00:57:03.359 align:start position:0%
under the Board of Education Authority
 
00:57:06.710 --> 00:57:06.720 align:start position:0%
undertook rul making it became this
 
00:57:10.630 --> 00:57:10.640 align:start position:0%
document right here the code of conduct
 
00:57:13.349 --> 00:57:13.359 align:start position:0%
it is available on our website but
 
00:57:16.270 --> 00:57:16.280 align:start position:0%
because this governs an individual's
 
00:57:19.270 --> 00:57:19.280 align:start position:0%
license a teacher's license we felt the
 
00:57:22.510 --> 00:57:22.520 align:start position:0%
need to put it into a booklet to make it
 
00:57:25.309 --> 00:57:25.319 align:start position:0%
accessible to let the field know that
 
00:57:27.870 --> 00:57:27.880 align:start position:0%
this is your guiding document I have
 
00:57:29.390 --> 00:57:29.400 align:start position:0%
these available if anyone would like
 
00:57:31.870 --> 00:57:31.880 align:start position:0%
them we have them at the
 
00:57:35.630 --> 00:57:35.640 align:start position:0%
department and in large part and of just
 
00:57:38.069 --> 00:57:38.079 align:start position:0%
very briefly the the principles are the
 
00:57:39.710 --> 00:57:39.720 align:start position:0%
first one is responsibility to the
 
00:57:45.870 --> 00:57:45.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:47.870 --> 00:57:47.880 align:start position:0%
professionals the second one is
 
00:57:50.510 --> 00:57:50.520 align:start position:0%
responsibility to students the third is
 
00:57:52.750 --> 00:57:52.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility to the school community
 
00:57:54.470 --> 00:57:54.480 align:start position:0%
and the fourth is responsible and
 
00:57:56.750 --> 00:57:56.760 align:start position:0%
ethical use of Technology as it relates
 
00:57:58.710 --> 00:57:58.720 align:start position:0%
to students schools and other
 
00:58:01.190 --> 00:58:01.200 align:start position:0%
educational professionals so this is the
 
00:58:05.349 --> 00:58:05.359 align:start position:0%
guiding document for licens educators as
 
00:58:07.190 --> 00:58:07.200 align:start position:0%
I mentioned I'm not an
 
00:58:10.309 --> 00:58:10.319 align:start position:0%
educator I'm an attorney and similar to
 
00:58:13.069 --> 00:58:13.079 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn we have our own code
 
00:58:15.670 --> 00:58:15.680 align:start position:0%
of ethics and standards for for
 
00:58:18.829 --> 00:58:18.839 align:start position:0%
attorneys so all that being said there
 
00:58:21.150 --> 00:58:21.160 align:start position:0%
was a question about the role of the
 
00:58:23.549 --> 00:58:23.559 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office the role of
 
00:58:26.870 --> 00:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office they are
 
00:58:28.950 --> 00:58:28.960 align:start position:0%
the Department's civil
 
00:58:32.069 --> 00:58:32.079 align:start position:0%
councel as representative Lynn said if
 
00:58:34.430 --> 00:58:34.440 align:start position:0%
the department gets sued it is the
 
00:58:36.150 --> 00:58:36.160 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office that will
 
00:58:38.670 --> 00:58:38.680 align:start position:0%
represent the state agency in a court of
 
00:58:41.029 --> 00:58:41.039 align:start position:0%
law but the Attorney General's office
 
00:58:43.349 --> 00:58:43.359 align:start position:0%
defers to the state agency whether it's
 
00:58:44.789 --> 00:58:44.799 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education or the
 
00:58:47.990 --> 00:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor or any other state
 
00:58:52.710 --> 00:58:52.720 align:start position:0%
agency to do its own oversight
 
00:58:56.549 --> 00:58:56.559 align:start position:0%
on on the field that they regulate and
 
00:58:58.910 --> 00:58:58.920 align:start position:0%
so the Department of Education or rather
 
00:59:01.190 --> 00:59:01.200 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office would not
 
00:59:03.430 --> 00:59:03.440 align:start position:0%
come into the Department of Education
 
00:59:06.069 --> 00:59:06.079 align:start position:0%
and conduct one of these Administrative
 
00:59:08.349 --> 00:59:08.359 align:start position:0%
Hearings as it pertains to an
 
00:59:11.190 --> 00:59:11.200 align:start position:0%
individual's teaching
 
00:59:13.349 --> 00:59:13.359 align:start position:0%
credential there was another question
 
00:59:15.870 --> 00:59:15.880 align:start position:0%
posed and this has um had a lot of
 
00:59:18.230 --> 00:59:18.240 align:start position:0%
traction over the past years as this
 
00:59:22.029 --> 00:59:22.039 align:start position:0%
bill has been uh discussed and worked on
 
00:59:23.510 --> 00:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
as to whether or not the Attorney
 
00:59:26.990 --> 00:59:27.000 align:start position:0%
General's office can obtain a subpoena
 
00:59:29.549 --> 00:59:29.559 align:start position:0%
on behalf of another state agency in
 
00:59:31.470 --> 00:59:31.480 align:start position:0%
this instance the Department of
 
00:59:33.789 --> 00:59:33.799 align:start position:0%
Education my understanding and speaking
 
00:59:35.789 --> 00:59:35.799 align:start position:0%
with the Attorney General's office is
 
00:59:38.549 --> 00:59:38.559 align:start position:0%
that they cannot that is not a role that
 
00:59:40.029 --> 00:59:40.039 align:start position:0%
they would serve I think to
 
00:59:42.230 --> 00:59:42.240 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn's point that would
 
00:59:45.109 --> 00:59:45.119 align:start position:0%
be very it be a very onerous uh feature
 
00:59:46.589 --> 00:59:46.599 align:start position:0%
if they were to take that on for every
 
00:59:49.710 --> 00:59:49.720 align:start position:0%
state agency and more to the point if
 
00:59:52.470 --> 00:59:52.480 align:start position:0%
the agency doesn't have the authority in
 
00:59:55.630 --> 00:59:55.640 align:start position:0%
statute to seek a subpoena it would
 
00:59:58.150 --> 00:59:58.160 align:start position:0%
probably be the wrong Avenue for the
 
01:00:01.309 --> 01:00:01.319 align:start position:0%
agency to then ask another agency to
 
01:00:04.829 --> 01:00:04.839 align:start position:0%
obtain that document for them which is
 
01:00:07.470 --> 01:00:07.480 align:start position:0%
why the department is here for House
 
01:00:10.589 --> 01:00:10.599 align:start position:0%
Bill 520 um you know the question has
 
01:00:13.270 --> 01:00:13.280 align:start position:0%
also come up can you give an instance in
 
01:00:16.270 --> 01:00:16.280 align:start position:0%
which this was this was necessary in
 
01:00:18.309 --> 01:00:18.319 align:start position:0%
which it was needed so let me give you a
 
01:00:20.710 --> 01:00:20.720 align:start position:0%
quick overview in terms of how the
 
01:00:23.630 --> 01:00:23.640 align:start position:0%
department operates on these
 
01:00:26.150 --> 01:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
cases this document that I've referenced
 
01:00:28.430 --> 01:00:28.440 align:start position:0%
the code of conduct if you were to look
 
01:00:32.270 --> 01:00:32.280 align:start position:0%
in our rules you would find it under
 
01:00:35.950 --> 01:00:35.960 align:start position:0%
ed510 ed510 sets forth those four
 
01:00:38.150 --> 01:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
principles and there's another principle
 
01:00:41.069 --> 01:00:41.079 align:start position:0%
the the duty to report it sets out those
 
01:00:43.190 --> 01:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
principles as I mentioned that govern
 
01:00:45.710 --> 01:00:45.720 align:start position:0%
someone's teaching
 
01:00:50.190 --> 01:00:50.200 align:start position:0%
credential it is the ed5 11s that set
 
01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
forth the due process that
 
01:00:55.990 --> 01:00:56.000 align:start position:0%
governs when the department undertakes
 
01:00:57.750 --> 01:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
takes an
 
01:01:00.589 --> 01:01:00.599 align:start position:0%
investigation and if an individual is
 
01:01:02.549 --> 01:01:02.559 align:start position:0%
placed under investigation and that is a
 
01:01:05.470 --> 01:01:05.480 align:start position:0%
term of art under our uh under our Ed
 
01:01:09.069 --> 01:01:09.079 align:start position:0%
511s that individual is noticed they
 
01:01:10.829 --> 01:01:10.839 align:start position:0%
receive a letter from the Department
 
01:01:13.750 --> 01:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
sent certified mail letting them know
 
01:01:15.190 --> 01:01:15.200 align:start position:0%
the department has opened an
 
01:01:17.430 --> 01:01:17.440 align:start position:0%
investigation here's the alleged
 
01:01:19.630 --> 01:01:19.640 align:start position:0%
violation this is the principle We
 
01:01:21.910 --> 01:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
Believe has been violated and here's the
 
01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:22.990 align:start position:0%
Believe has been violated and here's the
factual

01:01:22.990 --> 01:01:23.000 align:start position:0%
factual
 
01:01:25.950 --> 01:01:25.960 align:start position:0%
basis the superintendent of the employe
 
01:01:29.150 --> 01:01:29.160 align:start position:0%
school district is also notified so to
 
01:01:32.270 --> 01:01:32.280 align:start position:0%
your point the school is involved in
 
01:01:35.349 --> 01:01:35.359 align:start position:0%
that the department really values its
 
01:01:36.870 --> 01:01:36.880 align:start position:0%
connections and its working
 
01:01:39.710 --> 01:01:39.720 align:start position:0%
relationships with the field that
 
01:01:41.910 --> 01:01:41.920 align:start position:0%
includes credential holders non-
 
01:01:44.910 --> 01:01:44.920 align:start position:0%
credential holders school districts and
 
01:01:47.150 --> 01:01:47.160 align:start position:0%
superintendents so we did not want to
 
01:01:49.470 --> 01:01:49.480 align:start position:0%
place someone under investigation and
 
01:01:52.029 --> 01:01:52.039 align:start position:0%
not notify the
 
01:01:53.990 --> 01:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
superintendent because it really is a
 
01:01:56.910 --> 01:01:56.920 align:start position:0%
working relationship in large part it is
 
01:01:59.069 --> 01:01:59.079 align:start position:0%
the school district that will undertake
 
01:02:01.430 --> 01:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
the investigation this is the difference
 
01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:03.109 align:start position:0%
the investigation this is the difference
between

01:02:03.109 --> 01:02:03.119 align:start position:0%
between
 
01:02:05.349 --> 01:02:05.359 align:start position:0%
employment and
 
01:02:07.750 --> 01:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
lure and so the school district
 
01:02:11.109 --> 01:02:11.119 align:start position:0%
typically will undertake the
 
01:02:13.029 --> 01:02:13.039 align:start position:0%
investigation and we've seen that in
 
01:02:16.029 --> 01:02:16.039 align:start position:0%
some high-profile cases namely uh there
 
01:02:20.470 --> 01:02:20.480 align:start position:0%
was a case in 2018 maybe early 2019 here
 
01:02:23.470 --> 01:02:23.480 align:start position:0%
in conquer with uh an individual a
 
01:02:26.309 --> 01:02:26.319 align:start position:0%
licens educator who was having sexual
 
01:02:28.349 --> 01:02:28.359 align:start position:0%
relationships with with students uh
 
01:02:31.109 --> 01:02:31.119 align:start position:0%
underage girls it was the school
 
01:02:33.589 --> 01:02:33.599 align:start position:0%
district that hired an outside
 
01:02:35.349 --> 01:02:35.359 align:start position:0%
investigator has nothing to do with the
 
01:02:38.670 --> 01:02:38.680 align:start position:0%
Department of Education hired an outside
 
01:02:42.870 --> 01:02:42.880 align:start position:0%
investigator to come in and do a full
 
01:02:44.870 --> 01:02:44.880 align:start position:0%
investigation right that was the school
 
01:02:47.430 --> 01:02:47.440 align:start position:0%
district's decision to hire an attorney
 
01:02:50.069 --> 01:02:50.079 align:start position:0%
to come in and do a full-blown
 
01:02:53.549 --> 01:02:53.559 align:start position:0%
investigation into that issue because it
 
01:02:55.029 --> 01:02:55.039 align:start position:0%
is the school district who makes that
 
01:02:57.710 --> 01:02:57.720 align:start position:0%
decision to hire someone to do an
 
01:03:00.510 --> 01:03:00.520 align:start position:0%
investigation that investigation that
 
01:03:03.750 --> 01:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
report belongs to the school
 
01:03:05.589 --> 01:03:05.599 align:start position:0%
district it doesn't belong to the
 
01:03:08.269 --> 01:03:08.279 align:start position:0%
Department of Education it belongs to
 
01:03:10.710 --> 01:03:10.720 align:start position:0%
the school district they paid for it it
 
01:03:12.390 --> 01:03:12.400 align:start position:0%
is their
 
01:03:15.269 --> 01:03:15.279 align:start position:0%
product and the case out of concrete is
 
01:03:16.309 --> 01:03:16.319 align:start position:0%
a great
 
01:03:18.109 --> 01:03:18.119 align:start position:0%
example that
 
01:03:21.390 --> 01:03:21.400 align:start position:0%
educator uh committed sexual assault is
 
01:03:23.990 --> 01:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
currently in prison in Massachusetts for
 
01:03:25.950 --> 01:03:25.960 align:start position:0%
having committed sexual assault on Young
 
01:03:28.029 --> 01:03:28.039 align:start position:0%
girls and there was another young victim
 
01:03:29.190 --> 01:03:29.200 align:start position:0%
involved as
 
01:03:32.670 --> 01:03:32.680 align:start position:0%
well and yet the department could not
 
01:03:33.990 --> 01:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
simply just say the concrete School
 
01:03:35.829 --> 01:03:35.839 align:start position:0%
District can I have a copy of the
 
01:03:39.349 --> 01:03:39.359 align:start position:0%
report we we it was very challenging to
 
01:03:41.589 --> 01:03:41.599 align:start position:0%
get a copy of that report and in fact I
 
01:03:44.789 --> 01:03:44.799 align:start position:0%
had to go to the attorney's office to
 
01:03:47.190 --> 01:03:47.200 align:start position:0%
view it and I was not allowed to take
 
01:03:49.710 --> 01:03:49.720 align:start position:0%
it I was not allowed to have a copy of
 
01:03:52.109 --> 01:03:52.119 align:start position:0%
it so in terms of the Department's
 
01:03:55.870 --> 01:03:55.880 align:start position:0%
ability to move forward in taking that
 
01:03:59.029 --> 01:03:59.039 align:start position:0%
that particular educator to a hearing to
 
01:04:01.349 --> 01:04:01.359 align:start position:0%
obtain that Educator's license I would
 
01:04:02.950 --> 01:04:02.960 align:start position:0%
need as part of due process and
 
01:04:05.510 --> 01:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
fundamental fairness to provide that
 
01:04:08.029 --> 01:04:08.039 align:start position:0%
report to the credential
 
01:04:11.029 --> 01:04:11.039 align:start position:0%
holder but I didn't have
 
01:04:14.069 --> 01:04:14.079 align:start position:0%
it and so these are some of the things
 
01:04:15.829 --> 01:04:15.839 align:start position:0%
that these are some of the Practical
 
01:04:17.470 --> 01:04:17.480 align:start position:0%
realities that the department strug
 
01:04:19.150 --> 01:04:19.160 align:start position:0%
struggles with and deals with and
 
01:04:21.470 --> 01:04:21.480 align:start position:0%
ultimately in that instance the
 
01:04:23.670 --> 01:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
credential holder turned his license
 
01:04:26.750 --> 01:04:26.760 align:start position:0%
over he surrendered it right it worked
 
01:04:28.870 --> 01:04:28.880 align:start position:0%
out and that is what the department has
 
01:04:32.309 --> 01:04:32.319 align:start position:0%
been successful at doing but given the
 
01:04:34.230 --> 01:04:34.240 align:start position:0%
nature of what the department is working
 
01:04:37.349 --> 01:04:37.359 align:start position:0%
on child safety and I would encourage
 
01:04:38.870 --> 01:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
each of you to look at those four
 
01:04:40.390 --> 01:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
principles that are laid out in the code
 
01:04:43.029 --> 01:04:43.039 align:start position:0%
of conduct and what you will see is a
 
01:04:49.990 --> 01:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:53.029 --> 01:04:53.039 align:start position:0%
safety so I am not here to say in the
 
01:04:55.349 --> 01:04:55.359 align:start position:0%
case of you know State versus Jones we
 
01:04:56.870 --> 01:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
were not not able to get this document
 
01:04:59.269 --> 01:04:59.279 align:start position:0%
and this is why we need it I am here to
 
01:05:02.109 --> 01:05:02.119 align:start position:0%
say given the code of conduct given the
 
01:05:04.190 --> 01:05:04.200 align:start position:0%
important work the department does in
 
01:05:06.470 --> 01:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
making sure that credential holders are
 
01:05:09.190 --> 01:05:09.200 align:start position:0%
appropriate around children we would
 
01:05:12.230 --> 01:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
like this subpoena power as a tool in
 
01:05:14.109 --> 01:05:14.119 align:start position:0%
the toolbox we don't need it as a first
 
01:05:16.950 --> 01:05:16.960 align:start position:0%
line of defense again we really do value
 
01:05:19.230 --> 01:05:19.240 align:start position:0%
our relationship with the field and
 
01:05:21.430 --> 01:05:21.440 align:start position:0%
school districts and and we pride
 
01:05:23.430 --> 01:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
ourselves on a good working relationship
 
01:05:24.789 --> 01:05:24.799 align:start position:0%
with the school because much to your
 
01:05:27.349 --> 01:05:27.359 align:start position:0%
points uh representative the schools are
 
01:05:30.349 --> 01:05:30.359 align:start position:0%
a critical part of this we cannot do
 
01:05:32.789 --> 01:05:32.799 align:start position:0%
these investigations without our
 
01:05:35.549 --> 01:05:35.559 align:start position:0%
partners and the only instance in which
 
01:05:37.910 --> 01:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
the department typically takes the lead
 
01:05:40.510 --> 01:05:40.520 align:start position:0%
if you will um and does not defer to the
 
01:05:43.190 --> 01:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
school district to to do the uh initial
 
01:05:46.710 --> 01:05:46.720 align:start position:0%
investigation is in cases that are older
 
01:05:49.150 --> 01:05:49.160 align:start position:0%
so we have had instances very small
 
01:05:50.750 --> 01:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
number of cases but we have had
 
01:05:53.150 --> 01:05:53.160 align:start position:0%
instances in people coming forward and
 
01:05:55.630 --> 01:05:55.640 align:start position:0%
saying you know back in the 90s back
 
01:05:57.269 --> 01:05:57.279 align:start position:0%
back in the early 2000s I had a
 
01:05:59.710 --> 01:05:59.720 align:start position:0%
relationship with an
 
01:06:03.309 --> 01:06:03.319 align:start position:0%
educator and and that individual is is
 
01:06:05.230 --> 01:06:05.240 align:start position:0%
still in the school district and I'm
 
01:06:08.470 --> 01:06:08.480 align:start position:0%
concerned um if that person's safer and
 
01:06:10.549 --> 01:06:10.559 align:start position:0%
children and in that instance it will
 
01:06:12.309 --> 01:06:12.319 align:start position:0%
typically be the Department of Education
 
01:06:14.230 --> 01:06:14.240 align:start position:0%
that will initiate and lead the
 
01:06:16.309 --> 01:06:16.319 align:start position:0%
investigation and not the district and
 
01:06:18.069 --> 01:06:18.079 align:start position:0%
we have had those cases they typically
 
01:06:21.549 --> 01:06:21.559 align:start position:0%
have made the news um but as
 
01:06:25.589 --> 01:06:25.599 align:start position:0%
always I have talked way too much as
 
01:06:28.750 --> 01:06:28.760 align:start position:0%
lawyers tend to do so I will open myself
 
01:06:30.470 --> 01:06:30.480 align:start position:0%
up to questions I thank you for your
 
01:06:32.549 --> 01:06:32.559 align:start position:0%
time and your patience I know this bill
 
01:06:35.109 --> 01:06:35.119 align:start position:0%
has kind of been the cat that we fed
 
01:06:37.990 --> 01:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
once and keeps coming back um so I
 
01:06:39.510 --> 01:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate your time and your patience
 
01:06:41.269 --> 01:06:41.279 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions it was
 
01:06:42.670 --> 01:06:42.680 align:start position:0%
excellent information by the way so I
 
01:06:45.589 --> 01:06:45.599 align:start position:0%
appreciate that any questions over there
 
01:06:45.599 --> 01:06:47.470 align:start position:0%
appreciate that any questions over there
representative

01:06:47.470 --> 01:06:47.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:06:52.150 --> 01:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
bir thank you Mr chair thank you uh
 
01:06:53.789 --> 01:06:53.799 align:start position:0%
witness that's all right I've been
 
01:06:56.069 --> 01:06:56.079 align:start position:0%
called worse attorney fon
 
01:06:58.470 --> 01:06:58.480 align:start position:0%
um and I appreciate your self-reflection
 
01:07:00.870 --> 01:07:00.880 align:start position:0%
at the end of your comments uh I have a
 
01:07:03.309 --> 01:07:03.319 align:start position:0%
simple question that hopefully will'll
 
01:07:06.829 --> 01:07:06.839 align:start position:0%
just have a very short answer and that
 
01:07:09.470 --> 01:07:09.480 align:start position:0%
is can you
 
01:07:14.510 --> 01:07:14.520 align:start position:0%
quantify the number of cases that the D
 
01:07:18.230 --> 01:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
OE has not been able
 
01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:19.829 align:start position:0%
OE has not been able
to

01:07:19.829 --> 01:07:19.839 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:07:23.870 --> 01:07:23.880 align:start position:0%
um uh effectively access information for
 
01:07:28.309 --> 01:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:31.230 --> 01:07:31.240 align:start position:0%
we have been able to access the
 
01:07:33.750 --> 01:07:33.760 align:start position:0%
information that we need thank you
 
01:07:36.710 --> 01:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
that's all I asked representative Perez
 
01:07:38.829 --> 01:07:38.839 align:start position:0%
thank you thanks for taking my question
 
01:07:43.150 --> 01:07:43.160 align:start position:0%
um if a a complaint is issued against a
 
01:07:46.710 --> 01:07:46.720 align:start position:0%
in a a teacher that might affect their
 
01:07:49.870 --> 01:07:49.880 align:start position:0%
credentials and that complaint goes to
 
01:07:53.510 --> 01:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
the um principal and then to the um the
 
01:07:56.470 --> 01:07:56.480 align:start position:0%
SAU superintendent
 
01:07:58.670 --> 01:07:58.680 align:start position:0%
is there anything mandating that they
 
01:08:01.069 --> 01:08:01.079 align:start position:0%
have to bring it to the Department of
 
01:08:04.710 --> 01:08:04.720 align:start position:0%
Education because my concern is the
 
01:08:08.029 --> 01:08:08.039 align:start position:0%
incidences that might affect someone's
 
01:08:11.349 --> 01:08:11.359 align:start position:0%
credentialing that never make it to
 
01:08:14.269 --> 01:08:14.279 align:start position:0%
you thank you for the
 
01:08:16.870 --> 01:08:16.880 align:start position:0%
question within the code of conduct
 
01:08:19.789 --> 01:08:19.799 align:start position:0%
there is a duty to report um the
 
01:08:21.550 --> 01:08:21.560 align:start position:0%
superintendent has a obligation to
 
01:08:24.510 --> 01:08:24.520 align:start position:0%
report to the Department of Education if
 
01:08:26.349 --> 01:08:26.359 align:start position:0%
they believe the there is a violation of
 
01:08:28.870 --> 01:08:28.880 align:start position:0%
the code of conduct much to your point
 
01:08:31.030 --> 01:08:31.040 align:start position:0%
however I think there are a lot of
 
01:08:33.870 --> 01:08:33.880 align:start position:0%
instances in which a school district
 
01:08:37.430 --> 01:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
policy could be violated but does not
 
01:08:39.789 --> 01:08:39.799 align:start position:0%
affect the code of conduct there are
 
01:08:41.829 --> 01:08:41.839 align:start position:0%
many many policies whether it's people
 
01:08:43.550 --> 01:08:43.560 align:start position:0%
showing up on time or classroom
 
01:08:46.430 --> 01:08:46.440 align:start position:0%
management or classroom organization
 
01:08:48.789 --> 01:08:48.799 align:start position:0%
that might have an effect at the local
 
01:08:51.229 --> 01:08:51.239 align:start position:0%
school district is level it might very
 
01:08:53.749 --> 01:08:53.759 align:start position:0%
well be an employment issue but it does
 
01:08:55.590 --> 01:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
not rise to the level of the code of
 
01:08:57.630 --> 01:08:57.640 align:start position:0%
conduct again I would encourage all the
 
01:08:59.669 --> 01:08:59.679 align:start position:0%
members of this committee to look at the
 
01:09:01.229 --> 01:09:01.239 align:start position:0%
code of conduct whether it's this
 
01:09:04.590 --> 01:09:04.600 align:start position:0%
booklet or the ed510 on our
 
01:09:07.910 --> 01:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
website as these are really focused on
 
01:09:10.669 --> 01:09:10.679 align:start position:0%
child safety
 
01:09:13.510 --> 01:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
issues representative uh
 
01:09:15.829 --> 01:09:15.839 align:start position:0%
Morton thank you chair and thank thank
 
01:09:18.990 --> 01:09:19.000 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony uh attorney um so
 
01:09:21.550 --> 01:09:21.560 align:start position:0%
my sister's been a teacher for 35 years
 
01:09:23.709 --> 01:09:23.719 align:start position:0%
two of our grandparents were Educators
 
01:09:25.789 --> 01:09:25.799 align:start position:0%
for more than 40 years my grand father
 
01:09:27.550 --> 01:09:27.560 align:start position:0%
was the superintendent of marac Valley
 
01:09:29.470 --> 01:09:29.480 align:start position:0%
Schools opened the school in
 
01:09:32.229 --> 01:09:32.239 align:start position:0%
1967 so I'm very much pro-education I
 
01:09:34.349 --> 01:09:34.359 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure everyone here
 
01:09:37.149 --> 01:09:37.159 align:start position:0%
understands that um I I just have a
 
01:09:39.189 --> 01:09:39.199 align:start position:0%
question is this going to help
 
01:09:41.430 --> 01:09:41.440 align:start position:0%
streamline your
 
01:09:43.709 --> 01:09:43.719 align:start position:0%
procedures thank you for the question
 
01:09:46.189 --> 01:09:46.199 align:start position:0%
and uh I'm happy to hear you come from a
 
01:09:48.910 --> 01:09:48.920 align:start position:0%
family of Educators um very briefly my
 
01:09:50.709 --> 01:09:50.719 align:start position:0%
mom was a special ed teacher here in New
 
01:09:51.950 --> 01:09:51.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and when I called her and told
 
01:09:53.829 --> 01:09:53.839 align:start position:0%
her I was going to law school she said
 
01:09:55.950 --> 01:09:55.960 align:start position:0%
but wait I hate those people
 
01:09:58.070 --> 01:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
um and and and not much has changed
 
01:10:00.870 --> 01:10:00.880 align:start position:0%
since so um thank you to your family for
 
01:10:04.470 --> 01:10:04.480 align:start position:0%
for all their work the short answer is
 
01:10:06.350 --> 01:10:06.360 align:start position:0%
yes it will help to streamline it
 
01:10:08.510 --> 01:10:08.520 align:start position:0%
because the department has been
 
01:10:11.390 --> 01:10:11.400 align:start position:0%
successful in navigating these cases but
 
01:10:13.910 --> 01:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
it hasn't always been the straightest
 
01:10:16.630 --> 01:10:16.640 align:start position:0%
line and so this really is a tool in the
 
01:10:19.229 --> 01:10:19.239 align:start position:0%
toolbox this is not meant to disrupt or
 
01:10:22.149 --> 01:10:22.159 align:start position:0%
affect our really good strong working
 
01:10:24.350 --> 01:10:24.360 align:start position:0%
relationships with the field we value
 
01:10:26.229 --> 01:10:26.239 align:start position:0%
those and I cannot cannot emphasize that
 
01:10:28.870 --> 01:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
enough this is not to go pounding around
 
01:10:31.310 --> 01:10:31.320 align:start position:0%
and showing and flexing off our muscle
 
01:10:33.310 --> 01:10:33.320 align:start position:0%
this is a
 
01:10:36.110 --> 01:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
tool for those horrible cases that we
 
01:10:37.470 --> 01:10:37.480 align:start position:0%
read about in the paper where the
 
01:10:40.030 --> 01:10:40.040 align:start position:0%
department says we need to proceed and
 
01:10:42.189 --> 01:10:42.199 align:start position:0%
obtain this person's
 
01:10:45.149 --> 01:10:45.159 align:start position:0%
credential representative Manos thank
 
01:10:46.870 --> 01:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
you Mr Vice chair and thank you for
 
01:10:49.470 --> 01:10:49.480 align:start position:0%
taking my question attorney Fenton um is
 
01:10:52.990 --> 01:10:53.000 align:start position:0%
it correct that you uh finalized a rule
 
01:10:56.590 --> 01:10:56.600 align:start position:0%
making recently and if so do any of the
 
01:11:00.830 --> 01:11:00.840 align:start position:0%
rules um affect due process in the
 
01:11:02.630 --> 01:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
context of this bill that we're working
 
01:11:05.070 --> 01:11:05.080 align:start position:0%
on thank you very much for the question
 
01:11:07.030 --> 01:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
that was in my notes to address and I
 
01:11:08.630 --> 01:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
failed to do so so I appreciate you
 
01:11:10.310 --> 01:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
bring that to my attention as I
 
01:11:12.669 --> 01:11:12.679 align:start position:0%
mentioned the ed5 11s which handle our
 
01:11:16.110 --> 01:11:16.120 align:start position:0%
due process piece of how we implement
 
01:11:18.630 --> 01:11:18.640 align:start position:0%
the code of conduct those were recently
 
01:11:21.669 --> 01:11:21.679 align:start position:0%
redone and they were finalized um I want
 
01:11:25.430 --> 01:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
to say June 17th of 2024 I know someone
 
01:11:27.390 --> 01:11:27.400 align:start position:0%
in mid June they were finalized and
 
01:11:29.110 --> 01:11:29.120 align:start position:0%
adopted and again you can find those on
 
01:11:32.870 --> 01:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
our website we redid those um because we
 
01:11:35.189 --> 01:11:35.199 align:start position:0%
realized that the rules that we had
 
01:11:38.510 --> 01:11:38.520 align:start position:0%
originally drafted uh were insufficient
 
01:11:40.430 --> 01:11:40.440 align:start position:0%
we needed to strengthen them we needed
 
01:11:42.669 --> 01:11:42.679 align:start position:0%
to make them better and I'm humble
 
01:11:44.870 --> 01:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
enough to say I drafted the first
 
01:11:47.470 --> 01:11:47.480 align:start position:0%
version realized that we needed to make
 
01:11:49.550 --> 01:11:49.560 align:start position:0%
it better and I drafted the second
 
01:11:51.270 --> 01:11:51.280 align:start position:0%
version with our with our stakeholder
 
01:11:54.350 --> 01:11:54.360 align:start position:0%
Partners nowhere in the Ed 511s does it
 
01:11:56.189 --> 01:11:56.199 align:start position:0%
talk about
 
01:11:58.070 --> 01:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
subpoenas it talks about the
 
01:12:00.669 --> 01:12:00.679 align:start position:0%
investigative process and notifying a
 
01:12:02.870 --> 01:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
credential holder that they are under
 
01:12:04.669 --> 01:12:04.679 align:start position:0%
investigation notifying the
 
01:12:06.629 --> 01:12:06.639 align:start position:0%
superintendent of the employing school
 
01:12:08.550 --> 01:12:08.560 align:start position:0%
district that an individual is under
 
01:12:12.629 --> 01:12:12.639 align:start position:0%
investigation and what the hearing looks
 
01:12:18.350 --> 01:12:18.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:26.470 --> 01:12:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:29.070 --> 01:12:29.080 align:start position:0%
it's okay thanks I decided not to ask
 
01:12:31.990 --> 01:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
you that's okay representative trip
 
01:12:33.590 --> 01:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:12:37.070 --> 01:12:37.080 align:start position:0%
my question
 
01:12:41.149 --> 01:12:41.159 align:start position:0%
uh it appears that uh while you're able
 
01:12:44.629 --> 01:12:44.639 align:start position:0%
to get all the information that you want
 
01:12:47.550 --> 01:12:47.560 align:start position:0%
from the school districts uh there may
 
01:12:50.430 --> 01:12:50.440 align:start position:0%
be some uh
 
01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:52.270 align:start position:0%
be some uh
hesitancy

01:12:52.270 --> 01:12:52.280 align:start position:0%
hesitancy
 
01:12:55.229 --> 01:12:55.239 align:start position:0%
uh would it be true to say that uh
 
01:12:58.070 --> 01:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
having subpena power would uh make them
 
01:12:59.110 --> 01:12:59.120 align:start position:0%
much more
 
01:13:02.470 --> 01:13:02.480 align:start position:0%
compliant that's that's certainly The
 
01:13:04.590 --> 01:13:04.600 align:start position:0%
Hope in in the first instance we don't
 
01:13:06.590 --> 01:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
want to have to use that
 
01:13:09.870 --> 01:13:09.880 align:start position:0%
power but the reality is as I mentioned
 
01:13:12.189 --> 01:13:12.199 align:start position:0%
earlier and and you gave me a very nice
 
01:13:13.990 --> 01:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
short answer to give you and being the
 
01:13:16.030 --> 01:13:16.040 align:start position:0%
lawyer I am I'm going to just add to it
 
01:13:17.910 --> 01:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
the reality is there are times where we
 
01:13:20.430 --> 01:13:20.440 align:start position:0%
need that subpoena power and and I
 
01:13:22.030 --> 01:13:22.040 align:start position:0%
cannot emphasize enough how much we
 
01:13:25.149 --> 01:13:25.159 align:start position:0%
value our working relationships but yes
 
01:13:26.870 --> 01:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
there have been times where where we
 
01:13:28.470 --> 01:13:28.480 align:start position:0%
might need that tool in the toolbox
 
01:13:31.830 --> 01:13:31.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Smith thank you
 
01:13:35.310 --> 01:13:35.320 align:start position:0%
very much if in fact this bill were to
 
01:13:39.590 --> 01:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
pass um would that mean that you would
 
01:13:41.550 --> 01:13:41.560 align:start position:0%
now have the
 
01:13:44.709 --> 01:13:44.719 align:start position:0%
authority to ask
 
01:13:46.990 --> 01:13:47.000 align:start position:0%
contractors with whom you have entered
 
01:13:51.310 --> 01:13:51.320 align:start position:0%
into um a professional relationship to
 
01:13:55.110 --> 01:13:55.120 align:start position:0%
share with you uh detailed inform
 
01:14:00.070 --> 01:14:00.080 align:start position:0%
information about how they in fact
 
01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:02.470 align:start position:0%
information about how they in fact
um

01:14:02.470 --> 01:14:02.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:06.270 --> 01:14:06.280 align:start position:0%
uh uh acquire and
 
01:14:12.470 --> 01:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:16.550 --> 01:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:18.750 --> 01:14:18.760 align:start position:0%
don't as you well know and everyone
 
01:14:20.750 --> 01:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
knows you do not have to answer any
 
01:14:22.189 --> 01:14:22.199 align:start position:0%
question that we
 
01:14:26.629 --> 01:14:26.639 align:start position:0%
ask I actually didn't know that I
 
01:14:28.870 --> 01:14:28.880 align:start position:0%
you learn something new every day um
 
01:14:30.790 --> 01:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
we'll just subpoena
 
01:14:34.149 --> 01:14:34.159 align:start position:0%
you perfect I I've been there before let
 
01:14:38.110 --> 01:14:38.120 align:start position:0%
me tell you um thank you for the
 
01:14:40.590 --> 01:14:40.600 align:start position:0%
question I was a little surprised by the
 
01:14:42.110 --> 01:14:42.120 align:start position:0%
question because that's not what this
 
01:14:44.550 --> 01:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
bill is intended for this bill is
 
01:14:46.870 --> 01:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
intended for violations of the code of
 
01:14:50.669 --> 01:14:50.679 align:start position:0%
conduct it is envisioned to handle
 
01:14:52.910 --> 01:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
investigations of Educators who might
 
01:14:56.550 --> 01:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
have harmed a child so I cannot Envision
 
01:14:59.709 --> 01:14:59.719 align:start position:0%
a a a situation and certainly it it
 
01:15:02.830 --> 01:15:02.840 align:start position:0%
would fall outside of of my purview it
 
01:15:04.030 --> 01:15:04.040 align:start position:0%
would fall outside of the code of
 
01:15:06.229 --> 01:15:06.239 align:start position:0%
conduct and I think the way the stat the
 
01:15:08.510 --> 01:15:08.520 align:start position:0%
the proposed bill is written it is
 
01:15:11.350 --> 01:15:11.360 align:start position:0%
narrowly tailored to allow the
 
01:15:13.070 --> 01:15:13.080 align:start position:0%
department to effectuate the power
 
01:15:14.310 --> 01:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
that's already been given by this
 
01:15:17.350 --> 01:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
legislative body in 21
 
01:15:21.870 --> 01:15:21.880 align:start position:0%
and9 and much to representative Lynn's
 
01:15:25.030 --> 01:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
point it's frustrating at times this
 
01:15:26.870 --> 01:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
state agency to have been given this
 
01:15:28.750 --> 01:15:28.760 align:start position:0%
authority to
 
01:15:32.149 --> 01:15:32.159 align:start position:0%
oversee licensing and make sure children
 
01:15:34.390 --> 01:15:34.400 align:start position:0%
are safe and not be given all the tools
 
01:15:37.149 --> 01:15:37.159 align:start position:0%
in which to do it so I thank you for
 
01:15:38.990 --> 01:15:39.000 align:start position:0%
your consideration I thank you for your
 
01:15:40.270 --> 01:15:40.280 align:start position:0%
time I hope I've answered all the
 
01:15:41.990 --> 01:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
questions and I see that I have
 
01:15:44.030 --> 01:15:44.040 align:start position:0%
not representative
 
01:15:48.790 --> 01:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
beron I I'm sorry Morton opposite ends
 
01:15:51.229 --> 01:15:51.239 align:start position:0%
uh so so real quick question is a
 
01:15:53.950 --> 01:15:53.960 align:start position:0%
followup to the other question if it's
 
01:15:57.110 --> 01:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
cutting um you know the procedural time
 
01:15:59.510 --> 01:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
would it then be neutral or do you think
 
01:16:01.790 --> 01:16:01.800 align:start position:0%
it um it would save the taxpayers money
 
01:16:03.550 --> 01:16:03.560 align:start position:0%
because it would be a cost cutting
 
01:16:05.430 --> 01:16:05.440 align:start position:0%
saving or savings measure as well
 
01:16:07.310 --> 01:16:07.320 align:start position:0%
because you're spending less time
 
01:16:08.950 --> 01:16:08.960 align:start position:0%
chasing after
 
01:16:11.350 --> 01:16:11.360 align:start position:0%
information I I I certainly hope that at
 
01:16:14.110 --> 01:16:14.120 align:start position:0%
the end of the day that it it helps to
 
01:16:15.990 --> 01:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
save time and if that helps to save
 
01:16:18.110 --> 01:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
taxpayer money of course the agency
 
01:16:20.149 --> 01:16:20.159 align:start position:0%
wants to do that
 
01:16:23.030 --> 01:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely representative Manos thank
 
01:16:24.550 --> 01:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
you Mr Vice chair and thank you again
 
01:16:28.709 --> 01:16:28.719 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um I believe and
 
01:16:31.030 --> 01:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
please correct me that the Attorney
 
01:16:32.870 --> 01:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
General would have advised the
 
01:16:35.870 --> 01:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
Department of Education on its Ru making
 
01:16:38.629 --> 01:16:38.639 align:start position:0%
on its Rec recent rule making and I'm
 
01:16:38.639 --> 01:16:39.910 align:start position:0%
on its Rec recent rule making and I'm
wondering

01:16:39.910 --> 01:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
wondering
 
01:16:44.070 --> 01:16:44.080 align:start position:0%
why doe would not have included subpoena
 
01:16:48.070 --> 01:16:48.080 align:start position:0%
power um in their revised
 
01:16:51.310 --> 01:16:51.320 align:start position:0%
rules thank you for the question
 
01:16:54.629 --> 01:16:54.639 align:start position:0%
um I wrote The Ed 511s originally as I
 
01:16:57.070 --> 01:16:57.080 align:start position:0%
me and I wrote the redraft that was
 
01:17:00.430 --> 01:17:00.440 align:start position:0%
adopted um June of 2024 I'm sure the
 
01:17:02.149 --> 01:17:02.159 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office might have
 
01:17:03.870 --> 01:17:03.880 align:start position:0%
been aware of that but that is really a
 
01:17:07.629 --> 01:17:07.639 align:start position:0%
function of the state agency
 
01:17:10.709 --> 01:17:10.719 align:start position:0%
um I don't recall having in-depth
 
01:17:12.030 --> 01:17:12.040 align:start position:0%
conversations with the Attorney
 
01:17:14.430 --> 01:17:14.440 align:start position:0%
General's office about that rul making
 
01:17:17.870 --> 01:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
piece obviously the other attorney who
 
01:17:19.830 --> 01:17:19.840 align:start position:0%
represents the Board of Education would
 
01:17:23.270 --> 01:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
be aware of that but there was no wasn't
 
01:17:26.270 --> 01:17:26.280 align:start position:0%
an in-depth
 
01:17:28.669 --> 01:17:28.679 align:start position:0%
well let me think
 
01:17:32.189 --> 01:17:32.199 align:start position:0%
um the other attorney who represents the
 
01:17:33.750 --> 01:17:33.760 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education and is
 
01:17:35.070 --> 01:17:35.080 align:start position:0%
connected with the Attorney General's
 
01:17:37.110 --> 01:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
office was aware of our rulemaking was
 
01:17:38.390 --> 01:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
aware of Ed
 
01:17:42.310 --> 01:17:42.320 align:start position:0%
511 um but to your point why subpoena
 
01:17:44.030 --> 01:17:44.040 align:start position:0%
power wasn't put in there is because the
 
01:17:45.830 --> 01:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
department at this time does not have
 
01:17:48.950 --> 01:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
the does not have that Authority if we
 
01:17:50.590 --> 01:17:50.600 align:start position:0%
don't have the authority we can't put it
 
01:17:52.709 --> 01:17:52.719 align:start position:0%
in our Ru making and if we put it in our
 
01:17:55.709 --> 01:17:55.719 align:start position:0%
Ru making it would have been flagged by
 
01:17:57.590 --> 01:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
OS and we wouldn't have been able to
 
01:17:59.830 --> 01:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
move forward with
 
01:18:01.790 --> 01:18:01.800 align:start position:0%
it any other
 
01:18:04.990 --> 01:18:05.000 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you wait you
 
01:18:07.229 --> 01:18:07.239 align:start position:0%
all set representative Berger on you I
 
01:18:08.510 --> 01:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
know I'm a little obsessed with this
 
01:18:11.270 --> 01:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
school district thing but
 
01:18:13.669 --> 01:18:13.679 align:start position:0%
um do you ever find that school
 
01:18:15.669 --> 01:18:15.679 align:start position:0%
districts actually have to contact the
 
01:18:17.310 --> 01:18:17.320 align:start position:0%
Department of Education if they have
 
01:18:18.830 --> 01:18:18.840 align:start position:0%
information before you
 
01:18:21.750 --> 01:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
do as far as okay so that's one thing I
 
01:18:23.229 --> 01:18:23.239 align:start position:0%
was just kind of curious how that
 
01:18:24.950 --> 01:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
communication goes back and forth so it
 
01:18:26.990 --> 01:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
could be driven from both then okay oh
 
01:18:29.030 --> 01:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely and in fact usually the
 
01:18:31.189 --> 01:18:31.199 align:start position:0%
information comes from the school
 
01:18:34.149 --> 01:18:34.159 align:start position:0%
district right okay they're kind of the
 
01:18:35.590 --> 01:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
charter schools as well because
 
01:18:37.470 --> 01:18:37.480 align:start position:0%
sometimes they have one they one school
 
01:18:39.790 --> 01:18:39.800 align:start position:0%
oh absolutely I
 
01:18:42.510 --> 01:18:42.520 align:start position:0%
mean we have good working relationships
 
01:18:45.550 --> 01:18:45.560 align:start position:0%
with the field and and I think field
 
01:18:47.430 --> 01:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
there there are times where the field
 
01:18:49.229 --> 01:18:49.239 align:start position:0%
and the department can be at odds but
 
01:18:52.070 --> 01:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
the reality is this when it comes to
 
01:18:56.070 --> 01:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
child safety everyone's on the same page
 
01:18:58.350 --> 01:18:58.360 align:start position:0%
there is not a school district or a Char
 
01:18:59.910 --> 01:18:59.920 align:start position:0%
school or a superintendent or a
 
01:19:03.030 --> 01:19:03.040 align:start position:0%
principal who is not going to be up in
 
01:19:05.390 --> 01:19:05.400 align:start position:0%
arms when it's about child safety and
 
01:19:06.590 --> 01:19:06.600 align:start position:0%
making sure that educators are
 
01:19:09.310 --> 01:19:09.320 align:start position:0%
appropriate around kids I have never met
 
01:19:11.629 --> 01:19:11.639 align:start position:0%
anyone in the field who says to me oh
 
01:19:14.270 --> 01:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
well yeah no big deal everyone is on the
 
01:19:16.189 --> 01:19:16.199 align:start position:0%
same page and the department is so proud
 
01:19:18.030 --> 01:19:18.040 align:start position:0%
of those working relationships because
 
01:19:20.510 --> 01:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
we are all moving in the same direction
 
01:19:22.790 --> 01:19:22.800 align:start position:0%
on this issue there might be other
 
01:19:25.950 --> 01:19:25.960 align:start position:0%
political issues that divide us but not
 
01:19:29.510 --> 01:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
this not when it comes to child safety
 
01:19:31.470 --> 01:19:31.480 align:start position:0%
and it is for that reason that we have
 
01:19:31.480 --> 01:19:33.430 align:start position:0%
and it is for that reason that we have
strong

01:19:33.430 --> 01:19:33.440 align:start position:0%
strong
 
01:19:35.629 --> 01:19:35.639 align:start position:0%
Partnerships any other
 
01:19:38.229 --> 01:19:38.239 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
01:19:40.110 --> 01:19:40.120 align:start position:0%
you again for your time and
 
01:19:57.830 --> 01:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:59.189 --> 01:19:59.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and committee
 
01:20:00.830 --> 01:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
members my name is David Trumble I'm
 
01:20:02.790 --> 01:20:02.800 align:start position:0%
from the town of where I oppose this
 
01:20:04.910 --> 01:20:04.920 align:start position:0%
bill is it is written I would agree with
 
01:20:06.470 --> 01:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
the last words of the last speaker
 
01:20:07.990 --> 01:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
everyone is on the same page when it
 
01:20:10.990 --> 01:20:11.000 align:start position:0%
comes to child safety the only question
 
01:20:13.990 --> 01:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
with this bill is subpoenas who should
 
01:20:16.149 --> 01:20:16.159 align:start position:0%
issue them and what should be the legal
 
01:20:18.350 --> 01:20:18.360 align:start position:0%
standard I believe the standard should
 
01:20:21.149 --> 01:20:21.159 align:start position:0%
be first it should be done by uh who is
 
01:20:22.390 --> 01:20:22.400 align:start position:0%
it should be done by the attorney
 
01:20:24.910 --> 01:20:24.920 align:start position:0%
general and two is the standard should
 
01:20:28.350 --> 01:20:28.360 align:start position:0%
be good cause let's look at how this is
 
01:20:31.510 --> 01:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
handled with other agencies in the State
 
01:20:33.910 --> 01:20:33.920 align:start position:0%
Communications common carriers if they
 
01:20:35.750 --> 01:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
need a subpoena it goes to the attorney
 
01:20:37.709 --> 01:20:37.719 align:start position:0%
general that's RSA
 
01:20:40.550 --> 01:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
76b charitable trusts goes to the
 
01:20:42.510 --> 01:20:42.520 align:start position:0%
attorney general RSA
 
01:20:46.750 --> 01:20:46.760 align:start position:0%
724 consumer protection act RSA 358a
 
01:20:48.790 --> 01:20:48.800 align:start position:0%
goes to the attorney general Department
 
01:20:51.790 --> 01:20:51.800 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services 170e goes
 
01:20:54.390 --> 01:20:54.400 align:start position:0%
to the attorney general in fact 170e
 
01:20:56.270 --> 01:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
deal deals with child care residential
 
01:20:58.750 --> 01:20:58.760 align:start position:0%
care and child placing agencies and it
 
01:21:01.229 --> 01:21:01.239 align:start position:0%
involves specifically disciplinary
 
01:21:03.470 --> 01:21:03.480 align:start position:0%
hearings which is exactly the case
 
01:21:05.669 --> 01:21:05.679 align:start position:0%
you're looking at here today and in that
 
01:21:07.830 --> 01:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
situation they require the Department of
 
01:21:09.390 --> 01:21:09.400 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services to go to the
 
01:21:11.510 --> 01:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
attorney general and they have to have
 
01:21:14.390 --> 01:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
good cause that's the standard we use
 
01:21:15.950 --> 01:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
elsewhere in the statutes in New
 
01:21:17.590 --> 01:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire not the standard that you're
 
01:21:19.990 --> 01:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
getting in front of you today as for
 
01:21:22.830 --> 01:21:22.840 align:start position:0%
what do other states do I looked to
 
01:21:24.590 --> 01:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
online and the only thing I could find
 
01:21:26.669 --> 01:21:26.679 align:start position:0%
was a thorough report called the
 
01:21:29.110 --> 01:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
administrative subpoena Authority
 
01:21:30.750 --> 01:21:30.760 align:start position:0%
written by the national District
 
01:21:32.590 --> 01:21:32.600 align:start position:0%
Attorneys Association which reviewed
 
01:21:35.709 --> 01:21:35.719 align:start position:0%
laws in all 50 states it's a 195 page
 
01:21:37.950 --> 01:21:37.960 align:start position:0%
report there are no education
 
01:21:39.229 --> 01:21:39.239 align:start position:0%
Commissioners who have independent
 
01:21:41.910 --> 01:21:41.920 align:start position:0%
subpoena power in the United States so
 
01:21:43.830 --> 01:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
the standard I believe should be go to
 
01:21:45.669 --> 01:21:45.679 align:start position:0%
the attorney general and they should
 
01:21:48.629 --> 01:21:48.639 align:start position:0%
have to get good cause and good cause is
 
01:21:50.510 --> 01:21:50.520 align:start position:0%
a legal phrase that has significance if
 
01:21:52.870 --> 01:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
you look up The subpoena world there's
 
01:21:55.110 --> 01:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
court cases that Define good cause
 
01:21:56.790 --> 01:21:56.800 align:start position:0%
there's law reviews that Define good
 
01:21:59.629 --> 01:21:59.639 align:start position:0%
cause it's more than the the low bar
 
01:22:01.390 --> 01:22:01.400 align:start position:0%
that is in in the bill that is written
 
01:22:05.149 --> 01:22:05.159 align:start position:0%
in front of you um I'd like to look at
 
01:22:07.830 --> 01:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
uh what the statute requires first of
 
01:22:09.950 --> 01:22:09.960 align:start position:0%
all it requires the hearings officer
 
01:22:13.390 --> 01:22:13.400 align:start position:0%
shall issue this subena if they meet two
 
01:22:15.870 --> 01:22:15.880 align:start position:0%
conditions first it's a possible
 
01:22:18.350 --> 01:22:18.360 align:start position:0%
violation of the code of conduct and
 
01:22:20.550 --> 01:22:20.560 align:start position:0%
second that it's reasonably likely to be
 
01:22:23.310 --> 01:22:23.320 align:start position:0%
relevant well as was testified to
 
01:22:25.189 --> 01:22:25.199 align:start position:0%
earlier the code of conduct has gone
 
01:22:27.790 --> 01:22:27.800 align:start position:0%
beyond credentialing it's gone beyond
 
01:22:30.390 --> 01:22:30.400 align:start position:0%
child safety it is now unfortunately
 
01:22:32.950 --> 01:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
gone into the culture wars so what this
 
01:22:35.790 --> 01:22:35.800 align:start position:0%
bill would do is permit subpoenas on a
 
01:22:38.149 --> 01:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
whole broad range of issues which was
 
01:22:41.149 --> 01:22:41.159 align:start position:0%
not the intent of the bill nor is it the
 
01:22:43.790 --> 01:22:43.800 align:start position:0%
issue of child safety as for reasonably
 
01:22:45.709 --> 01:22:45.719 align:start position:0%
likely to be relevant anything would be
 
01:22:47.669 --> 01:22:47.679 align:start position:0%
reasonably likely to be relevant on any
 
01:22:49.430 --> 01:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
of these bills whether or not a teacher
 
01:22:51.390 --> 01:22:51.400 align:start position:0%
is teaching what are they teaching in
 
01:22:52.870 --> 01:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
Black History Month what are they
 
01:22:55.110 --> 01:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
teaching in women's History Month all of
 
01:22:57.950 --> 01:22:57.960 align:start position:0%
those could be suspect under some of the
 
01:22:59.830 --> 01:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
bills that have been put forward by this
 
01:23:01.830 --> 01:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
legislature in the last couple of years
 
01:23:04.270 --> 01:23:04.280 align:start position:0%
so you have a very broad range of
 
01:23:07.470 --> 01:23:07.480 align:start position:0%
bills every lesson plan for every social
 
01:23:09.550 --> 01:23:09.560 align:start position:0%
studies teacher in the state could be
 
01:23:11.510 --> 01:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
subpoenaed because they could possibly
 
01:23:13.350 --> 01:23:13.360 align:start position:0%
be a violation of the code of conduct
 
01:23:15.030 --> 01:23:15.040 align:start position:0%
and they certainly would be reasonably
 
01:23:17.430 --> 01:23:17.440 align:start position:0%
likely uh to be relevant I'd like to
 
01:23:19.030 --> 01:23:19.040 align:start position:0%
just go back to a couple things attorney
 
01:23:21.030 --> 01:23:21.040 align:start position:0%
Fenton said three of them first the
 
01:23:22.709 --> 01:23:22.719 align:start position:0%
attorney said the the uh that the
 
01:23:25.149 --> 01:23:25.159 align:start position:0%
Attorney General defers to the agencies
 
01:23:27.189 --> 01:23:27.199 align:start position:0%
to do their own oversight that's fine
 
01:23:29.270 --> 01:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
the question is not does the doe do its
 
01:23:31.510 --> 01:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
own oversight it's who issues The
 
01:23:33.870 --> 01:23:33.880 align:start position:0%
subpoena the Attorney General would not
 
01:23:35.990 --> 01:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
come into the due and conduct a hearing
 
01:23:37.669 --> 01:23:37.679 align:start position:0%
no the question is not who conducts the
 
01:23:39.629 --> 01:23:39.639 align:start position:0%
hearing it's who gets to do the
 
01:23:41.790 --> 01:23:41.800 align:start position:0%
subpoenas the question then came up well
 
01:23:43.310 --> 01:23:43.320 align:start position:0%
can the Attorney General get us a Pena
 
01:23:44.750 --> 01:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
for an agency and the Attorney General
 
01:23:46.310 --> 01:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
said no of course they're going to say
 
01:23:47.790 --> 01:23:47.800 align:start position:0%
no because right now it's not in the
 
01:23:49.669 --> 01:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
statute but I gave you four other
 
01:23:51.750 --> 01:23:51.760 align:start position:0%
statutes where they are specifically
 
01:23:53.470 --> 01:23:53.480 align:start position:0%
obligated to get this subance so the
 
01:23:55.270 --> 01:23:55.280 align:start position:0%
answer could be if you make make it such
 
01:23:57.350 --> 01:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
you could fix this statute have the
 
01:23:59.390 --> 01:23:59.400 align:start position:0%
Attorney General do it lastly was there
 
01:24:02.070 --> 01:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
an example of an of a hearing in the
 
01:24:04.030 --> 01:24:04.040 align:start position:0%
conquered case again the Attorney
 
01:24:05.669 --> 01:24:05.679 align:start position:0%
General subpoena would solve that there
 
01:24:07.790 --> 01:24:07.800 align:start position:0%
is no example where the Attorney General
 
01:24:09.470 --> 01:24:09.480 align:start position:0%
subpoena won't solve it so then the
 
01:24:11.709 --> 01:24:11.719 align:start position:0%
question is why am I here today why do I
 
01:24:13.590 --> 01:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
want the Attorney General to do it
 
01:24:15.430 --> 01:24:15.440 align:start position:0%
rather than the Department of Education
 
01:24:17.270 --> 01:24:17.280 align:start position:0%
to do it and what concerns me is the
 
01:24:20.750 --> 01:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
chilling effect of this bill if teachers
 
01:24:24.350 --> 01:24:24.360 align:start position:0%
believe that there will be subpoenas ISS
 
01:24:26.110 --> 01:24:26.120 align:start position:0%
ued as to whether or not they are
 
01:24:29.229 --> 01:24:29.239 align:start position:0%
teaching black history in a certain way
 
01:24:31.470 --> 01:24:31.480 align:start position:0%
and and there will be subpoenas they
 
01:24:33.470 --> 01:24:33.480 align:start position:0%
will avoid teaching it and we will
 
01:24:35.110 --> 01:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
produce a generation of children who
 
01:24:37.350 --> 01:24:37.360 align:start position:0%
don't understand the history because
 
01:24:39.629 --> 01:24:39.639 align:start position:0%
teachers will just avoid teaching the
 
01:24:40.629 --> 01:24:40.639 align:start position:0%
way you
 
01:24:43.109 --> 01:24:43.119 align:start position:0%
avoid having a negative impact on our
 
01:24:45.229 --> 01:24:45.239 align:start position:0%
state's education is just to Simply to
 
01:24:47.350 --> 01:24:47.360 align:start position:0%
say for this bill send it over to the
 
01:24:49.030 --> 01:24:49.040 align:start position:0%
attorney general have the Attorney
 
01:24:50.830 --> 01:24:50.840 align:start position:0%
General do it have them do it with good
 
01:24:52.790 --> 01:24:52.800 align:start position:0%
cause then you don't have this chilling
 
01:24:54.990 --> 01:24:55.000 align:start position:0%
effect on good education in our in our
 
01:24:57.669 --> 01:24:57.679 align:start position:0%
state um I think that covers everything
 
01:24:59.709 --> 01:24:59.719 align:start position:0%
I had to say okay thank you sir thank
 
01:25:02.070 --> 01:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
you I have a question so of the agencies
 
01:25:04.430 --> 01:25:04.440 align:start position:0%
you spoke of when you first started
 
01:25:07.790 --> 01:25:07.800 align:start position:0%
testifying how many of those agencies
 
01:25:10.510 --> 01:25:10.520 align:start position:0%
where the Attorney General Files The
 
01:25:13.189 --> 01:25:13.199 align:start position:0%
subpoena um have disciplinary hearings
 
01:25:15.350 --> 01:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
for lenses or
 
01:25:17.189 --> 01:25:17.199 align:start position:0%
certified uh
 
01:25:19.390 --> 01:25:19.400 align:start position:0%
employees uh or is it the case that they
 
01:25:21.870 --> 01:25:21.880 align:start position:0%
are filing these subpoenas for
 
01:25:24.030 --> 01:25:24.040 align:start position:0%
violations of a certain statute that
 
01:25:26.669 --> 01:25:26.679 align:start position:0%
those agencies cover so like with the
 
01:25:28.430 --> 01:25:28.440 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
01:25:30.390 --> 01:25:30.400 align:start position:0%
example that was specifically for a
 
01:25:33.910 --> 01:25:33.920 align:start position:0%
disciplinary hearing that's uh RSA 170e
 
01:25:37.510 --> 01:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
section 41 the department uh talks about
 
01:25:39.149 --> 01:25:39.159 align:start position:0%
disciplinary hearings and they go to the
 
01:25:41.990 --> 01:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
attorney general for Good Cost shown to
 
01:25:44.990 --> 01:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
subpoena Witnesses and compel papers and
 
01:25:47.229 --> 01:25:47.239 align:start position:0%
Records in any disciplinary hearing
 
01:25:48.750 --> 01:25:48.760 align:start position:0%
under that subdivision so that's
 
01:25:51.470 --> 01:25:51.480 align:start position:0%
specific to disciplinary hearings um I
 
01:25:52.910 --> 01:25:52.920 align:start position:0%
didn't print out the other statutes I
 
01:25:54.629 --> 01:25:54.639 align:start position:0%
looked at them this morning I I'm pretty
 
01:25:57.629 --> 01:25:57.639 align:start position:0%
sure the charitable trust one is pretty
 
01:26:00.149 --> 01:26:00.159 align:start position:0%
broad uh and again it's trying to
 
01:26:02.109 --> 01:26:02.119 align:start position:0%
protect the public so I I sorry I don't
 
01:26:03.550 --> 01:26:03.560 align:start position:0%
have those other three statutes in front
 
01:26:07.109 --> 01:26:07.119 align:start position:0%
of me okay so but as far as somebody
 
01:26:08.149 --> 01:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
that works for the Department of Health
 
01:26:10.669 --> 01:26:10.679 align:start position:0%
and Human Services is there specifically
 
01:26:12.390 --> 01:26:12.400 align:start position:0%
for their certifications or their
 
01:26:14.189 --> 01:26:14.199 align:start position:0%
licenses oh I understand understand okay
 
01:26:17.390 --> 01:26:17.400 align:start position:0%
no okay this this this is uh I I believe
 
01:26:19.350 --> 01:26:19.360 align:start position:0%
this would be for cases where there's a
 
01:26:21.070 --> 01:26:21.080 align:start position:0%
disciplinary hearing for somebody who
 
01:26:23.590 --> 01:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
works in child care residential care or
 
01:26:25.430 --> 01:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
child placing agencies if there's a
 
01:26:26.790 --> 01:26:26.800 align:start position:0%
disciplinary hearing it's a little
 
01:26:29.149 --> 01:26:29.159 align:start position:0%
different than a certification but that
 
01:26:30.109 --> 01:26:30.119 align:start position:0%
goes back to the question of
 
01:26:33.390 --> 01:26:33.400 align:start position:0%
certification if certification is simply
 
01:26:37.830 --> 01:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
um a child safety issue everybody agrees
 
01:26:39.189 --> 01:26:39.199 align:start position:0%
the hearing should be conducted you
 
01:26:41.109 --> 01:26:41.119 align:start position:0%
should get your subpoena swiftly put it
 
01:26:43.510 --> 01:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
in the law if if it's a child safety
 
01:26:45.510 --> 01:26:45.520 align:start position:0%
issue have the Attorney General do it
 
01:26:47.189 --> 01:26:47.199 align:start position:0%
they can do it very quickly they're
 
01:26:48.870 --> 01:26:48.880 align:start position:0%
lawyers that's what they do for work and
 
01:26:50.910 --> 01:26:50.920 align:start position:0%
there's a specific rule for lawyers it's
 
01:26:53.350 --> 01:26:53.360 align:start position:0%
rule 4.5 of the code of conduct for
 
01:26:54.990 --> 01:26:55.000 align:start position:0%
lawyers a lawyer shall not issue or
 
01:26:56.669 --> 01:26:56.679 align:start position:0%
obtain the issuance of a subpoena
 
01:26:58.390 --> 01:26:58.400 align:start position:0%
without good cause so they know how to
 
01:27:00.109 --> 01:27:00.119 align:start position:0%
issue subpoenas if there's a child
 
01:27:02.669 --> 01:27:02.679 align:start position:0%
safety issue by all means the Attorney
 
01:27:05.229 --> 01:27:05.239 align:start position:0%
General can get it quickly for you okay
 
01:27:06.149 --> 01:27:06.159 align:start position:0%

representative

01:27:27.030 --> 01:27:27.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:27:30.750 --> 01:27:30.760 align:start position:0%
bur uh thank you for your testimony
 
01:27:35.510 --> 01:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
leaving aside the issue of uh the AG's
 
01:27:40.950 --> 01:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
office versus doe running the show just
 
01:27:43.870 --> 01:27:43.880 align:start position:0%
talking about the issue of code of
 
01:27:47.669 --> 01:27:47.679 align:start position:0%
conduct um would you find this a better
 
01:27:51.629 --> 01:27:51.639 align:start position:0%
Bill if everywhere the term code of
 
01:27:55.990 --> 01:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
conduct was changed to to language
 
01:28:01.790 --> 01:28:01.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:04.030 --> 01:28:04.040 align:start position:0%
credentialing and eliminate the language
 
01:28:06.669 --> 01:28:06.679 align:start position:0%
of code of conduct uh thank you for the
 
01:28:09.750 --> 01:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
question representative I am not sure
 
01:28:11.229 --> 01:28:11.239 align:start position:0%
could you just to give me a little bit
 
01:28:13.149 --> 01:28:13.159 align:start position:0%
more to go on there like what what is it
 
01:28:14.550 --> 01:28:14.560 align:start position:0%
that you're trying to get at I'm not
 
01:28:16.470 --> 01:28:16.480 align:start position:0%
sure I quite get it my question to you
 
01:28:18.709 --> 01:28:18.719 align:start position:0%
is we've heard a lot of testimony from
 
01:28:24.470 --> 01:28:24.480 align:start position:0%
you and others that the code of conduct
 
01:28:28.430 --> 01:28:28.440 align:start position:0%
would allow investigations into an
 
01:28:31.350 --> 01:28:31.360 align:start position:0%
almost unlimited area of
 
01:28:34.790 --> 01:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
teaching if code of conduct were removed
 
01:28:38.669 --> 01:28:38.679 align:start position:0%
from the statute and instead or the bill
 
01:28:43.350 --> 01:28:43.360 align:start position:0%
and instead the bill only allowed these
 
01:28:47.430 --> 01:28:47.440 align:start position:0%
subpoenas for questions of
 
01:28:50.109 --> 01:28:50.119 align:start position:0%
credential would that solve the problem
 
01:28:54.910 --> 01:28:54.920 align:start position:0%
or is credential itself open up the door
 
01:28:57.830 --> 01:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
too wide uh I understand better thank
 
01:28:59.510 --> 01:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
you for the question I don't think you
 
01:29:01.310 --> 01:29:01.320 align:start position:0%
can separate it out because the code of
 
01:29:04.790 --> 01:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
conduct is what the the teachers have to
 
01:29:06.790 --> 01:29:06.800 align:start position:0%
follow and that's where the hearing is
 
01:29:07.830 --> 01:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
going to
 
01:29:10.629 --> 01:29:10.639 align:start position:0%
be um I think the distinction rather
 
01:29:12.350 --> 01:29:12.360 align:start position:0%
than credentialing a quote of conduct is
 
01:29:14.910 --> 01:29:14.920 align:start position:0%
it's if it's it's a safety issue that's
 
01:29:16.350 --> 01:29:16.360 align:start position:0%
that's where everybody immediately wants
 
01:29:18.790 --> 01:29:18.800 align:start position:0%
to get the Attorney General it's it's
 
01:29:20.709 --> 01:29:20.719 align:start position:0%
the issue is really as somebody said
 
01:29:23.229 --> 01:29:23.239 align:start position:0%
other committees are are studying bills
 
01:29:25.189 --> 01:29:25.199 align:start position:0%
and passing bills that have expanded
 
01:29:26.950 --> 01:29:26.960 align:start position:0%
what used to be understood as the code
 
01:29:28.870 --> 01:29:28.880 align:start position:0%
of conduct to being a broad thing
 
01:29:30.669 --> 01:29:30.679 align:start position:0%
because they're looking for how do we
 
01:29:32.390 --> 01:29:32.400 align:start position:0%
enforce this and put some punitive
 
01:29:34.830 --> 01:29:34.840 align:start position:0%
action on the teacher so they say oh
 
01:29:37.310 --> 01:29:37.320 align:start position:0%
okay we'll just put in it's you don't do
 
01:29:39.229 --> 01:29:39.239 align:start position:0%
this law now you violated the code of
 
01:29:41.030 --> 01:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
conduct so the code of conduct is now
 
01:29:43.990 --> 01:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
expanded to include how do you teach a
 
01:29:47.149 --> 01:29:47.159 align:start position:0%
certain lesson plan so but you can't you
 
01:29:48.629 --> 01:29:48.639 align:start position:0%
could shrink the code of conduct down to
 
01:29:50.790 --> 01:29:50.800 align:start position:0%
a reasonable size but I don't think you
 
01:29:52.310 --> 01:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
can take it out of this because that's
 
01:29:54.270 --> 01:29:54.280 align:start position:0%
where the hearings come from is would
 
01:29:55.750 --> 01:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
have but in the old days legitimate
 
01:29:57.390 --> 01:29:57.400 align:start position:0%
issues on Code of Conduct does that it
 
01:29:59.629 --> 01:29:59.639 align:start position:0%
make sense yeah okay thank you any other
 
01:30:02.590 --> 01:30:02.600 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
01:30:05.070 --> 01:30:05.080 align:start position:0%
trip uh are you representing your
 
01:30:07.149 --> 01:30:07.159 align:start position:0%
yourself or an organization I I just
 
01:30:09.669 --> 01:30:09.679 align:start position:0%
here as a citizen yeah right thank
 
01:30:12.430 --> 01:30:12.440 align:start position:0%
you representative Horgan um you're
 
01:30:13.750 --> 01:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
talking about expanding the code of
 
01:30:17.830 --> 01:30:17.840 align:start position:0%
conduct um will we be we be isn't there
 
01:30:19.510 --> 01:30:19.520 align:start position:0%
like an example of that um actually
 
01:30:21.830 --> 01:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
right across the hall about 12 feet from
 
01:30:24.149 --> 01:30:24.159 align:start position:0%
the door to this room with a uh non
 
01:30:25.950 --> 01:30:25.960 align:start position:0%
gered amendment to a bill which actually
 
01:30:28.310 --> 01:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
ironically is there relevance this
 
01:30:29.950 --> 01:30:29.960 align:start position:0%
question so I just that isn't that just
 
01:30:32.030 --> 01:30:32.040 align:start position:0%
one example of attempts to expand the
 
01:30:33.109 --> 01:30:33.119 align:start position:0%
code of Contex yes thank you
 
01:30:35.070 --> 01:30:35.080 align:start position:0%
representative Oran he's exactly right
 
01:30:37.709 --> 01:30:37.719 align:start position:0%
that's the the device of Concepts Bill
 
01:30:40.149 --> 01:30:40.159 align:start position:0%
there was a bill presented to repeal it
 
01:30:41.629 --> 01:30:41.639 align:start position:0%
and then there's another amendment today
 
01:30:44.070 --> 01:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
so that's exactly the issue here is like
 
01:30:46.550 --> 01:30:46.560 align:start position:0%
can you get a subpoena to make sure that
 
01:30:49.350 --> 01:30:49.360 align:start position:0%
people are teaching divisive Concepts
 
01:30:51.270 --> 01:30:51.280 align:start position:0%
correctly according to what you consider
 
01:30:53.229 --> 01:30:53.239 align:start position:0%
correctly I think that's the concern
 
01:30:56.350 --> 01:30:56.360 align:start position:0%
here is it's it's not defending teachers
 
01:30:57.430 --> 01:30:57.440 align:start position:0%
it's because teachers are just
 
01:30:59.830 --> 01:30:59.840 align:start position:0%
implements to educate our children I'm
 
01:31:01.470 --> 01:31:01.480 align:start position:0%
concerned about the children who won't
 
01:31:03.950 --> 01:31:03.960 align:start position:0%
get an education if they're afraid to
 
01:31:05.750 --> 01:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
talk about issues because they're afraid
 
01:31:07.750 --> 01:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
they're going to lose their license and
 
01:31:09.550 --> 01:31:09.560 align:start position:0%
if you make subpoenas too broad you
 
01:31:09.560 --> 01:31:10.590 align:start position:0%
if you make subpoenas too broad you
reduce

01:31:10.590 --> 01:31:10.600 align:start position:0%
reduce
 
01:31:12.629 --> 01:31:12.639 align:start position:0%
education any other
 
01:31:14.990 --> 01:31:15.000 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
01:31:35.550 --> 01:31:35.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:37.070 --> 01:31:37.080 align:start position:0%
okay yes good morning my name is Deborah
 
01:31:38.590 --> 01:31:38.600 align:start position:0%
how I am president of the American
 
01:31:40.510 --> 01:31:40.520 align:start position:0%
Federation of teachers New Hampshire uh
 
01:31:41.950 --> 01:31:41.960 align:start position:0%
we represent about
 
01:31:44.950 --> 01:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
3,500 Educators and School staff across
 
01:31:47.270 --> 01:31:47.280 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire as well as uh
 
01:31:50.430 --> 01:31:50.440 align:start position:0%
College faculty and town employees and
 
01:31:52.709 --> 01:31:52.719 align:start position:0%
uh we are here in opposition to HB 520
 
01:31:54.590 --> 01:31:54.600 align:start position:0%
and it's not because we are not
 
01:31:56.590 --> 01:31:56.600 align:start position:0%
concerned about children being safe in
 
01:31:58.790 --> 01:31:58.800 align:start position:0%
our schools we absolutely believe that
 
01:32:00.669 --> 01:32:00.679 align:start position:0%
is necessary and support the code of
 
01:32:02.790 --> 01:32:02.800 align:start position:0%
conduct what we don't support is
 
01:32:04.990 --> 01:32:05.000 align:start position:0%
subpoena power for the Department of
 
01:32:07.149 --> 01:32:07.159 align:start position:0%
Education even if it's done through
 
01:32:09.590 --> 01:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
hearing officers um we feel that this
 
01:32:12.030 --> 01:32:12.040 align:start position:0%
bill is a solution in search of a
 
01:32:13.990 --> 01:32:14.000 align:start position:0%
problem as we have heard the past two
 
01:32:15.350 --> 01:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
times we've have hearings on this and
 
01:32:17.990 --> 01:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
even again repeated today the department
 
01:32:19.830 --> 01:32:19.840 align:start position:0%
is able to get the information it needs
 
01:32:21.709 --> 01:32:21.719 align:start position:0%
we heard it very clearly stated uh from
 
01:32:24.590 --> 01:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
a previous testifier they can get the
 
01:32:26.109 --> 01:32:26.119 align:start position:0%
information they need even in that
 
01:32:27.950 --> 01:32:27.960 align:start position:0%
horrible case she mentioned here in
 
01:32:30.310 --> 01:32:30.320 align:start position:0%
conquer they got the information they
 
01:32:33.310 --> 01:32:33.320 align:start position:0%
needed had to go to the outside attorney
 
01:32:36.270 --> 01:32:36.280 align:start position:0%
that was hired by the uh School District
 
01:32:37.510 --> 01:32:37.520 align:start position:0%
but they were able to get the
 
01:32:38.870 --> 01:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
information they needed and they got the
 
01:32:41.390 --> 01:32:41.400 align:start position:0%
result they needed as well so why do we
 
01:32:43.750 --> 01:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
need this bill the department
 
01:32:45.510 --> 01:32:45.520 align:start position:0%
investigator testified that they are
 
01:32:47.750 --> 01:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
always able to get the information they
 
01:32:51.669 --> 01:32:51.679 align:start position:0%
need we are keeping Kids Safe using the
 
01:32:54.109 --> 01:32:54.119 align:start position:0%
investigatory processes that are in
 
01:32:58.590 --> 01:32:58.600 align:start position:0%
place this is an unnecessary bill um it
 
01:33:00.550 --> 01:33:00.560 align:start position:0%
would it
 
01:33:04.109 --> 01:33:04.119 align:start position:0%
would unbalance the current system we're
 
01:33:09.070 --> 01:33:09.080 align:start position:0%
using if we put this in place and um put
 
01:33:11.750 --> 01:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
the weight more heavily on the
 
01:33:14.750 --> 01:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
investigatory side you would not have
 
01:33:17.709 --> 01:33:17.719 align:start position:0%
the same power to subpoena as someone
 
01:33:19.550 --> 01:33:19.560 align:start position:0%
who is being accused of breaking the
 
01:33:21.790 --> 01:33:21.800 align:start position:0%
code of conduct at the same time so
 
01:33:24.270 --> 01:33:24.280 align:start position:0%
there are timelines in place
 
01:33:26.990 --> 01:33:27.000 align:start position:0%
and uh as someone who is suddenly
 
01:33:28.510 --> 01:33:28.520 align:start position:0%
accused of having broken the code of
 
01:33:29.950 --> 01:33:29.960 align:start position:0%
conduct you would not have the same
 
01:33:32.229 --> 01:33:32.239 align:start position:0%
amount of time to gather information to
 
01:33:35.229 --> 01:33:35.239 align:start position:0%
defend yourself and as um Mr Hawkins
 
01:33:38.390 --> 01:33:38.400 align:start position:0%
from Nea um testified there's only a
 
01:33:41.350 --> 01:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
limited amount of time to prepare your
 
01:33:44.910 --> 01:33:44.920 align:start position:0%
defense of that accusation before a
 
01:33:49.390 --> 01:33:49.400 align:start position:0%
hearing occurs so you would be um at a
 
01:33:51.550 --> 01:33:51.560 align:start position:0%
disadvantage before you're presented
 
01:33:54.990 --> 01:33:55.000 align:start position:0%
with what the results the department
 
01:33:58.390 --> 01:33:58.400 align:start position:0%
wants at that hearing so that would be
 
01:34:02.310 --> 01:34:02.320 align:start position:0%
unfair to uh have that occur uh my other
 
01:34:04.990 --> 01:34:05.000 align:start position:0%
point besides the fact that this is a um
 
01:34:08.470 --> 01:34:08.480 align:start position:0%
solution search of a problem is the
 
01:34:11.590 --> 01:34:11.600 align:start position:0%
safeguards in this bill although they
 
01:34:15.030 --> 01:34:15.040 align:start position:0%
look nice on paper um having the hearing
 
01:34:17.310 --> 01:34:17.320 align:start position:0%
officer who works for the Department of
 
01:34:20.510 --> 01:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
Education apply the test of whether the
 
01:34:22.870 --> 01:34:22.880 align:start position:0%
um subpoena is being sought in good
 
01:34:26.149 --> 01:34:26.159 align:start position:0%
faith and whether it's material for aena
 
01:34:27.750 --> 01:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
being asked for by his
 
01:34:30.669 --> 01:34:30.679 align:start position:0%
boss I'm a labor leader if the boss asks
 
01:34:32.470 --> 01:34:32.480 align:start position:0%
you to do something at least in your
 
01:34:35.149 --> 01:34:35.159 align:start position:0%
mind you know you're going to tend to
 
01:34:36.750 --> 01:34:36.760 align:start position:0%
agree with them even if you know you
 
01:34:39.270 --> 01:34:39.280 align:start position:0%
have all good intentions to view it
 
01:34:40.950 --> 01:34:40.960 align:start position:0%
impartially it's going to be very hard
 
01:34:42.070 --> 01:34:42.080 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:34:44.750 --> 01:34:44.760 align:start position:0%
impartial and there's all sorts of room
 
01:34:47.390 --> 01:34:47.400 align:start position:0%
for there to be undue pressure that's
 
01:34:49.390 --> 01:34:49.400 align:start position:0%
not a great standard the previous
 
01:34:53.229 --> 01:34:53.239 align:start position:0%
speaker told you of other um agencies
 
01:34:53.239 --> 01:34:54.189 align:start position:0%
speaker told you of other um agencies
other

01:34:54.189 --> 01:34:54.199 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:34:58.870 --> 01:34:58.880 align:start position:0%
um departments that have
 
01:35:01.350 --> 01:35:01.360 align:start position:0%
the have the Attorney General issues to
 
01:35:03.109 --> 01:35:03.119 align:start position:0%
be this specifically Health and Human
 
01:35:05.870 --> 01:35:05.880 align:start position:0%
Services has it for investigations uh in
 
01:35:08.830 --> 01:35:08.840 align:start position:0%
child care settings uh that are are very
 
01:35:10.070 --> 01:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
similar to what you're talking about
 
01:35:12.310 --> 01:35:12.320 align:start position:0%
here child safety that would be a more
 
01:35:14.350 --> 01:35:14.360 align:start position:0%
appropriate place to go for a subpoena
 
01:35:16.229 --> 01:35:16.239 align:start position:0%
because we do want to keep kids safe and
 
01:35:17.990 --> 01:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
we also don't want
 
01:35:22.430 --> 01:35:22.440 align:start position:0%
to poison the relationship between our
 
01:35:24.030 --> 01:35:24.040 align:start position:0%
department of education and our school
 
01:35:26.390 --> 01:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
districts who need to cooperate on these
 
01:35:28.189 --> 01:35:28.199 align:start position:0%
investigations or between the Department
 
01:35:30.430 --> 01:35:30.440 align:start position:0%
of Education and our Educators who are
 
01:35:31.830 --> 01:35:31.840 align:start position:0%
out there working with their children
 
01:35:34.550 --> 01:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
every day we don't want to be a climate
 
01:35:34.560 --> 01:35:36.109 align:start position:0%
every day we don't want to be a climate
of

01:35:36.109 --> 01:35:36.119 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:35:39.669 --> 01:35:39.679 align:start position:0%
fear we want everyone to be open and
 
01:35:41.550 --> 01:35:41.560 align:start position:0%
sharing information because we do all
 
01:35:44.070 --> 01:35:44.080 align:start position:0%
have the same goal of keeping Kids Safe
 
01:35:45.990 --> 01:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
making sure that they are learning and
 
01:35:48.550 --> 01:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
thriving and I do have written testimony
 
01:35:51.990 --> 01:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
to share but I do think that this bill
 
01:35:54.470 --> 01:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
is unnecessary because we are
 
01:35:57.830 --> 01:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
getting that job done already with the
 
01:35:59.229 --> 01:35:59.239 align:start position:0%
tools that we have this is an
 
01:36:03.390 --> 01:36:03.400 align:start position:0%
unnecessary tool thank you any
 
01:36:06.350 --> 01:36:06.360 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you I
 
01:36:07.910 --> 01:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
apologize for not having stap it I
 
01:36:10.669 --> 01:36:10.679 align:start position:0%
thought I had double-sided it that's
 
01:36:14.470 --> 01:36:14.480 align:start position:0%
fine Barrett is it Christina Christian
 
01:36:14.480 --> 01:36:24.790 align:start position:0%
fine Barrett is it Christina Christian

thank you Mr chair good morning members

Christina I am the executive director of
 
01:36:30.590 --> 01:36:30.600 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire school boards
 
01:36:32.109 --> 01:36:32.119 align:start position:0%
Association to be clear the school
 
01:36:33.669 --> 01:36:33.679 align:start position:0%
boards Association is not taking a
 
01:36:35.830 --> 01:36:35.840 align:start position:0%
position on this bill but we do want to
 
01:36:38.310 --> 01:36:38.320 align:start position:0%
identify a couple concerns that we uh
 
01:36:39.750 --> 01:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
that we have with with the language
 
01:36:41.629 --> 01:36:41.639 align:start position:0%
itself um I'll make a couple points
 
01:36:43.870 --> 01:36:43.880 align:start position:0%
about the bill um and then I will make a
 
01:36:46.590 --> 01:36:46.600 align:start position:0%
couple broader policy uh as points as
 
01:36:48.430 --> 01:36:48.440 align:start position:0%
well too I'll try and be brief
 
01:36:50.189 --> 01:36:50.199 align:start position:0%
recognizing we've been on this bill for
 
01:36:51.350 --> 01:36:51.360 align:start position:0%
a little bit more than an hour and a
 
01:36:54.590 --> 01:36:54.600 align:start position:0%
half um the first I'm on page one um
 
01:36:56.870 --> 01:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
lines 3 through six where it says that
 
01:36:59.510 --> 01:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
um a subpoena may be issued against any
 
01:37:03.030 --> 01:37:03.040 align:start position:0%
person um nhsb has concerns if that may
 
01:37:05.709 --> 01:37:05.719 align:start position:0%
be too broad does that just mean School
 
01:37:07.669 --> 01:37:07.679 align:start position:0%
District staff or the individual who is
 
01:37:09.390 --> 01:37:09.400 align:start position:0%
under investigation or could have
 
01:37:12.310 --> 01:37:12.320 align:start position:0%
possibly be um an a subpoena issued
 
01:37:14.109 --> 01:37:14.119 align:start position:0%
against a student who perhaps was a
 
01:37:16.270 --> 01:37:16.280 align:start position:0%
witness to something or perhaps even
 
01:37:19.229 --> 01:37:19.239 align:start position:0%
more concerning um the spouse or partner
 
01:37:21.550 --> 01:37:21.560 align:start position:0%
of of the licensed educator who may or
 
01:37:23.709 --> 01:37:23.719 align:start position:0%
may not have relevant information to
 
01:37:26.149 --> 01:37:26.159 align:start position:0%
whatever in in in investigation is going
 
01:37:28.229 --> 01:37:28.239 align:start position:0%
on we have concerns that that is a
 
01:37:30.669 --> 01:37:30.679 align:start position:0%
little bit too broad um the second
 
01:37:33.510 --> 01:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
aspect um that nhba has concerns with
 
01:37:37.270 --> 01:37:37.280 align:start position:0%
with the bill um I'm on um page one
 
01:37:41.189 --> 01:37:41.199 align:start position:0%
again lines 24 and 25 the person to whom
 
01:37:44.229 --> 01:37:44.239 align:start position:0%
the subpoena is directed May file a
 
01:37:46.669 --> 01:37:46.679 align:start position:0%
motion to quash or modify the subpoena
 
01:37:48.870 --> 01:37:48.880 align:start position:0%
with the hearings officer it's the
 
01:37:50.950 --> 01:37:50.960 align:start position:0%
hearings officer who's issuing The
 
01:37:53.550 --> 01:37:53.560 align:start position:0%
subpoena uh I find it curious that the
 
01:37:56.149 --> 01:37:56.159 align:start position:0%
individual who um would possibly quash
 
01:37:58.830 --> 01:37:58.840 align:start position:0%
The subpoena is also the individual who
 
01:38:01.750 --> 01:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
who who issued it that may be common um
 
01:38:03.870 --> 01:38:03.880 align:start position:0%
in other areas of law I simply don't
 
01:38:06.109 --> 01:38:06.119 align:start position:0%
know um but it seems to be that there
 
01:38:09.070 --> 01:38:09.080 align:start position:0%
should be um the appeal or or the motion
 
01:38:12.629 --> 01:38:12.639 align:start position:0%
of qua should be um uh provided to an
 
01:38:14.669 --> 01:38:14.679 align:start position:0%
independent third party rather than the
 
01:38:16.870 --> 01:38:16.880 align:start position:0%
person who is doing the
 
01:38:19.709 --> 01:38:19.719 align:start position:0%
investigation um and last um
 
01:38:21.709 --> 01:38:21.719 align:start position:0%
representative ber you you pointed this
 
01:38:24.669 --> 01:38:24.679 align:start position:0%
out that while the license holder um
 
01:38:27.109 --> 01:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
does have an opportunity to subpoena
 
01:38:29.470 --> 01:38:29.480 align:start position:0%
documents or or whatnot during the
 
01:38:31.709 --> 01:38:31.719 align:start position:0%
adjudicatory stage they don't have an
 
01:38:33.830 --> 01:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do so under this bill
 
01:38:36.149 --> 01:38:36.159 align:start position:0%
relative to the um the investigatory
 
01:38:39.390 --> 01:38:39.400 align:start position:0%
stage which nhsb nhba believes would be
 
01:38:41.910 --> 01:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
um the most important aspect of the of
 
01:38:45.669 --> 01:38:45.679 align:start position:0%
of the timelines um second um a broader
 
01:38:47.629 --> 01:38:47.639 align:start position:0%
aspect to the bill when nhba was
 
01:38:49.830 --> 01:38:49.840 align:start position:0%
testifying on the bill um uh two
 
01:38:51.830 --> 01:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
sessions ago and the proposed amendment
 
01:38:55.270 --> 01:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
two sessions ago um nsba suggested that
 
01:38:57.430 --> 01:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
um guard rails and safe safeguards be
 
01:38:59.669 --> 01:38:59.679 align:start position:0%
put in place for students and Student
 
01:39:02.550 --> 01:39:02.560 align:start position:0%
Records um unfortunately um House Bill
 
01:39:05.430 --> 01:39:05.440 align:start position:0%
520 um still does not contain those if a
 
01:39:07.310 --> 01:39:07.320 align:start position:0%
subpoena is going to be issued for
 
01:39:09.030 --> 01:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
Student Records that are otherwise
 
01:39:10.750 --> 01:39:10.760 align:start position:0%
exempt from disclosure under state and
 
01:39:12.910 --> 01:39:12.920 align:start position:0%
federal law we believe that there should
 
01:39:14.790 --> 01:39:14.800 align:start position:0%
be some guard rails put in the statute
 
01:39:16.589 --> 01:39:16.599 align:start position:0%
as to who at the department is going to
 
01:39:18.669 --> 01:39:18.679 align:start position:0%
have access to those how long the
 
01:39:20.870 --> 01:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
department is going to retain those at
 
01:39:22.350 --> 01:39:22.360 align:start position:0%
what point is the department going to
 
01:39:25.070 --> 01:39:25.080 align:start position:0%
destroy those student records um we also
 
01:39:27.430 --> 01:39:27.440 align:start position:0%
have concerns um about a child being
 
01:39:29.229 --> 01:39:29.239 align:start position:0%
subpoena and then the parents having to
 
01:39:31.310 --> 01:39:31.320 align:start position:0%
go through the rig roll of filing a
 
01:39:33.229 --> 01:39:33.239 align:start position:0%
motion to get a quashed before the
 
01:39:36.310 --> 01:39:36.320 align:start position:0%
hearings officer um the other aspect too
 
01:39:39.550 --> 01:39:39.560 align:start position:0%
I guess relative to the to the to the um
 
01:39:42.669 --> 01:39:42.679 align:start position:0%
to a child being subpoena there's no
 
01:39:44.790 --> 01:39:44.800 align:start position:0%
sort of enforcement mechanism in the
 
01:39:46.950 --> 01:39:46.960 align:start position:0%
statute if I'm a parent and my child is
 
01:39:49.229 --> 01:39:49.239 align:start position:0%
subpoena and I read the bill and I'm
 
01:39:51.070 --> 01:39:51.080 align:start position:0%
perhaps given notice in The subpoena
 
01:39:53.589 --> 01:39:53.599 align:start position:0%
that I have 10 days to file an appeal if
 
01:39:54.990 --> 01:39:55.000 align:start position:0%
I'm a parent and I don't show up and I
 
01:39:56.550 --> 01:39:56.560 align:start position:0%
don't bring my kid to
 
01:39:58.589 --> 01:39:58.599 align:start position:0%
testify what's the department going to
 
01:40:00.070 --> 01:40:00.080 align:start position:0%
do about it am I facing some sort of
 
01:40:01.589 --> 01:40:01.599 align:start position:0%
criminal penalty as a parent because I
 
01:40:03.189 --> 01:40:03.199 align:start position:0%
don't want my child talking to an
 
01:40:04.350 --> 01:40:04.360 align:start position:0%
investigator at the Department of
 
01:40:06.550 --> 01:40:06.560 align:start position:0%
Education the bill is not clear about
 
01:40:08.629 --> 01:40:08.639 align:start position:0%
that so those are our concerns with the
 
01:40:10.470 --> 01:40:10.480 align:start position:0%
statute itself I'm sorry the the bill
 
01:40:13.030 --> 01:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
itself a couple points to the larger um
 
01:40:14.950 --> 01:40:14.960 align:start position:0%
broader policy aspects by way of
 
01:40:17.550 --> 01:40:17.560 align:start position:0%
background I served on the uh committee
 
01:40:19.830 --> 01:40:19.840 align:start position:0%
that drafted the code of conduct back in
 
01:40:23.430 --> 01:40:23.440 align:start position:0%
2018 the primary focus of that committee
 
01:40:25.669 --> 01:40:25.679 align:start position:0%
in that group as Miss Fenton repeatedly
 
01:40:28.709 --> 01:40:28.719 align:start position:0%
stated was child safety the health
 
01:40:31.510 --> 01:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
safety and Welfare of children and we
 
01:40:33.550 --> 01:40:33.560 align:start position:0%
reached Great Compromise through the
 
01:40:35.229 --> 01:40:35.239 align:start position:0%
teachers unions through people from
 
01:40:37.709 --> 01:40:37.719 align:start position:0%
higher education School administrators
 
01:40:39.070 --> 01:40:39.080 align:start position:0%
School boarders Association and the
 
01:40:40.430 --> 01:40:40.440 align:start position:0%
Department of Education to come up with
 
01:40:42.390 --> 01:40:42.400 align:start position:0%
a really good document that everybody
 
01:40:44.189 --> 01:40:44.199 align:start position:0%
was happy with and everybody thought met
 
01:40:47.709 --> 01:40:47.719 align:start position:0%
the needs um to keep children safe it's
 
01:40:49.830 --> 01:40:49.840 align:start position:0%
important to remember that two sessions
 
01:40:51.950 --> 01:40:51.960 align:start position:0%
ago when the first subpoena bill was
 
01:40:53.790 --> 01:40:53.800 align:start position:0%
brought forth to this committee
 
01:40:56.589 --> 01:40:56.599 align:start position:0%
it had absolutely nothing to do with
 
01:40:59.189 --> 01:40:59.199 align:start position:0%
child safety it had to do with what
 
01:41:00.910 --> 01:41:00.920 align:start position:0%
books were being taught in public
 
01:41:04.229 --> 01:41:04.239 align:start position:0%
schools and as Mr Hawkins um spoke about
 
01:41:05.709 --> 01:41:05.719 align:start position:0%
during his testimony we've had a
 
01:41:08.350 --> 01:41:08.360 align:start position:0%
plethora of bills last session and this
 
01:41:11.950 --> 01:41:11.960 align:start position:0%
session seeking to broaden um impacts of
 
01:41:13.629 --> 01:41:13.639 align:start position:0%
the of the of the teacher code of
 
01:41:15.510 --> 01:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
conduct that have absolutely nothing to
 
01:41:18.669 --> 01:41:18.679 align:start position:0%
do with child safety and are far beyond
 
01:41:21.270 --> 01:41:21.280 align:start position:0%
what the original purpose and intent and
 
01:41:23.109 --> 01:41:23.119 align:start position:0%
Good Will created out of that committee
 
01:41:24.990 --> 01:41:25.000 align:start position:0%
was was with the current code of conduct
 
01:41:26.709 --> 01:41:26.719 align:start position:0%
it had to do with books had nothing to
 
01:41:28.870 --> 01:41:28.880 align:start position:0%
do with child safety so with that I'll
 
01:41:30.629 --> 01:41:30.639 align:start position:0%
close my remarks I'm happy to answer any
 
01:41:31.830 --> 01:41:31.840 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for taking my
 
01:41:33.390 --> 01:41:33.400 align:start position:0%
testimony are there any questions
 
01:41:33.400 --> 01:41:34.510 align:start position:0%
testimony are there any questions
representative

01:41:34.510 --> 01:41:34.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:41:36.830 --> 01:41:36.840 align:start position:0%
Tura yeah thank you thanks for taking
 
01:41:38.870 --> 01:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
the question um it came up in the
 
01:41:41.830 --> 01:41:41.840 align:start position:0%
earlier testimony by other um witnesses
 
01:41:45.390 --> 01:41:45.400 align:start position:0%
that um other departments go through the
 
01:41:48.149 --> 01:41:48.159 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office for subpoenas
 
01:41:51.750 --> 01:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
um and it seems in the list that you um
 
01:41:53.470 --> 01:41:53.480 align:start position:0%
laid out here that many of those those
 
01:41:55.709 --> 01:41:55.719 align:start position:0%
things could be handled by the
 
01:41:58.669 --> 01:41:58.679 align:start position:0%
discretion of the Attorney General if
 
01:42:01.629 --> 01:42:01.639 align:start position:0%
they um were the entity that that was
 
01:42:05.229 --> 01:42:05.239 align:start position:0%
being sought um would would it be your
 
01:42:06.390 --> 01:42:06.400 align:start position:0%
understanding that that would clear up
 
01:42:08.629 --> 01:42:08.639 align:start position:0%
some or or many of the questions that
 
01:42:10.070 --> 01:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
you've raised yeah thank you for the
 
01:42:12.270 --> 01:42:12.280 align:start position:0%
question representative um I know that's
 
01:42:13.910 --> 01:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
been part of the conversation over the
 
01:42:15.270 --> 01:42:15.280 align:start position:0%
last couple of bills that we've had
 
01:42:16.950 --> 01:42:16.960 align:start position:0%
relative to this I did hear one of the
 
01:42:20.270 --> 01:42:20.280 align:start position:0%
previous speakers suggest that um during
 
01:42:22.310 --> 01:42:22.320 align:start position:0%
his testimony I kind of nodded to myself
 
01:42:24.430 --> 01:42:24.440 align:start position:0%
and thought that might be a reasonable
 
01:42:28.430 --> 01:42:28.440 align:start position:0%
alternative thank you any other
 
01:42:31.109 --> 01:42:31.119 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
01:42:35.030 --> 01:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
Smith um could you tell me if you are
 
01:42:39.589 --> 01:42:39.599 align:start position:0%
aware of any
 
01:42:43.709 --> 01:42:43.719 align:start position:0%
um situation in which your
 
01:42:49.629 --> 01:42:49.639 align:start position:0%
organization would have advised um
 
01:42:53.750 --> 01:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh your constituents not to cooperate at
 
01:42:56.709 --> 01:42:56.719 align:start position:0%
with the uh Department of Education
 
01:42:57.629 --> 01:42:57.639 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:42:59.550 --> 01:42:59.560 align:start position:0%
representative um just to clarify our
 
01:43:00.870 --> 01:43:00.880 align:start position:0%
constituents are school boards and
 
01:43:03.350 --> 01:43:03.360 align:start position:0%
school board members um school boards
 
01:43:06.589 --> 01:43:06.599 align:start position:0%
are typically not involved in employee
 
01:43:09.430 --> 01:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
matters or employee investigations those
 
01:43:11.310 --> 01:43:11.320 align:start position:0%
are usually handled administratively
 
01:43:12.910 --> 01:43:12.920 align:start position:0%
through principles and
 
01:43:15.790 --> 01:43:15.800 align:start position:0%
superintendence um I'm trying to think
 
01:43:19.149 --> 01:43:19.159 align:start position:0%
if I've had occasion to speak to a a a a
 
01:43:22.390 --> 01:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
school board member about that no um
 
01:43:24.830 --> 01:43:24.840 align:start position:0%
nothing coming to mind we've certainly
 
01:43:27.310 --> 01:43:27.320 align:start position:0%
over the years had inquiries from school
 
01:43:28.950 --> 01:43:28.960 align:start position:0%
superintendents where they're not
 
01:43:30.470 --> 01:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
certain if they should report something
 
01:43:32.310 --> 01:43:32.320 align:start position:0%
to the Department of Education or
 
01:43:33.629 --> 01:43:33.639 align:start position:0%
they're not certain if it's a violation
 
01:43:35.709 --> 01:43:35.719 align:start position:0%
of the code of conduct Our advice is
 
01:43:37.189 --> 01:43:37.199 align:start position:0%
call the commissioner or call Miss
 
01:43:39.870 --> 01:43:39.880 align:start position:0%
Fenton and and flush it out that way I
 
01:43:42.189 --> 01:43:42.199 align:start position:0%
mean it's not my job as an attorney to
 
01:43:43.830 --> 01:43:43.840 align:start position:0%
tell you not to report something if you
 
01:43:45.510 --> 01:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
report something and the department
 
01:43:47.109 --> 01:43:47.119 align:start position:0%
doesn't need to go any further there's
 
01:43:49.189 --> 01:43:49.199 align:start position:0%
no harm no foul if you don't report
 
01:43:50.870 --> 01:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
there are significant
 
01:43:52.870 --> 01:43:52.880 align:start position:0%
consequences thank you any other
 
01:43:55.350 --> 01:43:55.360 align:start position:0%

committee
 
01:44:43.030 --> 01:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
um as
 
01:44:47.629 --> 01:44:47.639 align:start position:0%
um as those of you who were here in past
 
01:44:49.709 --> 01:44:49.719 align:start position:0%
uh in in the past legislative session
 
01:44:53.510 --> 01:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
may remember there was um a rather
 
01:44:55.669 --> 01:44:55.679 align:start position:0%
unfortunate incident that developed not
 
01:44:57.750 --> 01:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
in this committee fortunately but
 
01:45:01.629 --> 01:45:01.639 align:start position:0%
involving um the issuance or the or the
 
01:45:06.310 --> 01:45:06.320 align:start position:0%
attempted issuance of uh a subpoena to
 
01:45:06.320 --> 01:45:07.510 align:start position:0%
attempted issuance of uh a subpoena to
uh

01:45:07.510 --> 01:45:07.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:45:10.910 --> 01:45:10.920 align:start position:0%
Witnesses um coming before the
 
01:45:14.830 --> 01:45:14.840 align:start position:0%
legislature that resulted in quite a Kur
 
01:45:18.310 --> 01:45:18.320 align:start position:0%
fuffle um
 
01:45:21.109 --> 01:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
uh and it was really I I think a very
 
01:45:23.310 --> 01:45:23.320 align:start position:0%
unfortunate situation but one of of the
 
01:45:25.910 --> 01:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
things that developed as a result of
 
01:45:28.910 --> 01:45:28.920 align:start position:0%
that was the question of well was the
 
01:45:30.470 --> 01:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
whole question of
 
01:45:30.480 --> 01:45:31.990 align:start position:0%
whole question of
issuing

01:45:31.990 --> 01:45:32.000 align:start position:0%
issuing
 
01:45:34.470 --> 01:45:34.480 align:start position:0%
subpoenas can that be done and there is
 
01:45:36.189 --> 01:45:36.199 align:start position:0%
a in the existing rule there is a
 
01:45:39.669 --> 01:45:39.679 align:start position:0%
provision that that um that talks about
 
01:45:41.589 --> 01:45:41.599 align:start position:0%
that but there was a question of then
 
01:45:44.149 --> 01:45:44.159 align:start position:0%
what you know is there any law on this
 
01:45:46.030 --> 01:45:46.040 align:start position:0%
is there any is there any statute is
 
01:45:49.990 --> 01:45:50.000 align:start position:0%
there any law what um what
 
01:45:52.629 --> 01:45:52.639 align:start position:0%
uh what's the consequence if a subpoena
 
01:45:54.589 --> 01:45:54.599 align:start position:0%
is ISS and if it's not complied with and
 
01:45:58.830 --> 01:45:58.840 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing so um the um there
 
01:46:00.750 --> 01:46:00.760 align:start position:0%
was a
 
01:46:03.270 --> 01:46:03.280 align:start position:0%
uh a group of people who got together
 
01:46:05.510 --> 01:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
and the the in particular the speaker
 
01:46:07.709 --> 01:46:07.719 align:start position:0%
and the deputy speaker uh asked me if I
 
01:46:09.709 --> 01:46:09.719 align:start position:0%
would take a stab at
 
01:46:14.430 --> 01:46:14.440 align:start position:0%
drafting um legislation to cover that um
 
01:46:17.070 --> 01:46:17.080 align:start position:0%
and I I undertook some research and I
 
01:46:20.709 --> 01:46:20.719 align:start position:0%
and I and what I and 188 is sort of the
 
01:46:26.589 --> 01:46:26.599 align:start position:0%
product of that um of that effort and um
 
01:46:28.430 --> 01:46:28.440 align:start position:0%
it basically
 
01:46:32.830 --> 01:46:32.840 align:start position:0%
establishes both a civil and a and a
 
01:46:36.589 --> 01:46:36.599 align:start position:0%
criminal penalty for someone who is
 
01:46:38.750 --> 01:46:38.760 align:start position:0%
subpoenaed and there are you know in the
 
01:46:41.189 --> 01:46:41.199 align:start position:0%
in the rule it's uh there there are very
 
01:46:44.270 --> 01:46:44.280 align:start position:0%
limited circumstances including which
 
01:46:46.830 --> 01:46:46.840 align:start position:0%
requires the the approval of the whole
 
01:46:50.629 --> 01:46:50.639 align:start position:0%
house and requires uh the concurrence of
 
01:46:53.589 --> 01:46:53.599 align:start position:0%
the speaker in the in the in the current
 
01:46:55.510 --> 01:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
rule as I would call it before a
 
01:46:58.790 --> 01:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
subpoena can be issued this statute
 
01:47:00.470 --> 01:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't deal with the issuing of
 
01:47:02.510 --> 01:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
subpoena of the subpoenas as such but it
 
01:47:05.030 --> 01:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
deals with what happens if somebody
 
01:47:08.390 --> 01:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
fails to comply what what can the
 
01:47:11.070 --> 01:47:11.080 align:start position:0%
legislature do to compel
 
01:47:14.990 --> 01:47:15.000 align:start position:0%
compliance and during the course of my
 
01:47:20.189 --> 01:47:20.199 align:start position:0%
research on this um what what I um what
 
01:47:24.430 --> 01:47:24.440 align:start position:0%
I discovered is that
 
01:47:27.189 --> 01:47:27.199 align:start position:0%
even without is that there's no there is
 
01:47:29.070 --> 01:47:29.080 align:start position:0%
no law in New Hampshire on this there
 
01:47:31.870 --> 01:47:31.880 align:start position:0%
are a number of of other um of states
 
01:47:33.149 --> 01:47:33.159 align:start position:0%
that do have laws on this and in
 
01:47:37.189 --> 01:47:37.199 align:start position:0%
particular I I took uh the the sort of
 
01:47:39.390 --> 01:47:39.400 align:start position:0%
generally the format for this from a
 
01:47:43.070 --> 01:47:43.080 align:start position:0%
federal statute um dealing with contempt
 
01:47:44.950 --> 01:47:44.960 align:start position:0%
of contemp of Congress this is not
 
01:47:46.790 --> 01:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
exactly the same as that statute but it
 
01:47:48.990 --> 01:47:49.000 align:start position:0%
it does incorporate a number of elements
 
01:47:52.310 --> 01:47:52.320 align:start position:0%
of it um at any rate one of the things
 
01:47:55.189 --> 01:47:55.199 align:start position:0%
that I discovered in the course of that
 
01:47:57.990 --> 01:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
research is that there is some Authority
 
01:47:59.870 --> 01:47:59.880 align:start position:0%
there's no New Hampshire Authority on
 
01:48:01.510 --> 01:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
this and I'm not really sure how many
 
01:48:02.910 --> 01:48:02.920 align:start position:0%
other states have authority on it but
 
01:48:04.470 --> 01:48:04.480 align:start position:0%
there is some at the federal level there
 
01:48:07.430 --> 01:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
is some Authority that basically says
 
01:48:09.910 --> 01:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
that Congress that a legislative body
 
01:48:11.870 --> 01:48:11.880 align:start position:0%
has the inherent
 
01:48:14.750 --> 01:48:14.760 align:start position:0%
authority to
 
01:48:19.390 --> 01:48:19.400 align:start position:0%
um uh both compel people to appear uh
 
01:48:22.589 --> 01:48:22.599 align:start position:0%
before it via subpoena and if they fail
 
01:48:24.990 --> 01:48:25.000 align:start position:0%
to do that to punish them so for for
 
01:48:28.550 --> 01:48:28.560 align:start position:0%
example there you know in uh many in the
 
01:48:31.990 --> 01:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
in the long in the long past um there
 
01:48:34.470 --> 01:48:34.480 align:start position:0%
were a number of instances and as I my
 
01:48:38.430 --> 01:48:38.440 align:start position:0%
the research uh that I recall the last
 
01:48:40.189 --> 01:48:40.199 align:start position:0%
time it happened at the federal level
 
01:48:42.030 --> 01:48:42.040 align:start position:0%
was about I think in
 
01:48:45.510 --> 01:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
1914 where the Congress uh or a
 
01:48:48.990 --> 01:48:49.000 align:start position:0%
committee of the of the um of the of one
 
01:48:50.550 --> 01:48:50.560 align:start position:0%
house or the other with the approval of
 
01:48:53.830 --> 01:48:53.840 align:start position:0%
the of the of the Congress
 
01:48:55.950 --> 01:48:55.960 align:start position:0%
uh actually sent the sergeant-at-arms
 
01:48:59.030 --> 01:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
out uh to arrest somebody who had failed
 
01:49:04.030 --> 01:49:04.040 align:start position:0%
to comply with an order to appear um and
 
01:49:08.070 --> 01:49:08.080 align:start position:0%
um uh you know so that
 
01:49:10.470 --> 01:49:10.480 align:start position:0%
that inherent
 
01:49:13.270 --> 01:49:13.280 align:start position:0%
authority of the legislature arguably
 
01:49:15.109 --> 01:49:15.119 align:start position:0%
would allow us to do that too I don't
 
01:49:16.510 --> 01:49:16.520 align:start position:0%
think that we've ever done it I'm not
 
01:49:18.229 --> 01:49:18.239 align:start position:0%
suggesting that we ever would want to
 
01:49:20.589 --> 01:49:20.599 align:start position:0%
consider doing it but apparently there
 
01:49:22.229 --> 01:49:22.239 align:start position:0%
is some at least arguably there's some
 
01:49:24.229 --> 01:49:24.239 align:start position:0%
inheritance authority to do that but one
 
01:49:25.990 --> 01:49:26.000 align:start position:0%
of the things that that prompted this
 
01:49:29.070 --> 01:49:29.080 align:start position:0%
bill was you a number of people said
 
01:49:31.709 --> 01:49:31.719 align:start position:0%
well you know wait a minute I mean if we
 
01:49:33.950 --> 01:49:33.960 align:start position:0%
ever actually got to that point do we
 
01:49:35.589 --> 01:49:35.599 align:start position:0%
should we just sort of leave it up to
 
01:49:38.790 --> 01:49:38.800 align:start position:0%
like you know we'll we'll we'll decide
 
01:49:40.990 --> 01:49:41.000 align:start position:0%
whether we want to have to send send the
 
01:49:44.830 --> 01:49:44.840 align:start position:0%
sergeant-at-arms out um uh to to arrest
 
01:49:46.390 --> 01:49:46.400 align:start position:0%
somebody and then one once they once
 
01:49:48.270 --> 01:49:48.280 align:start position:0%
they arrest them what do we do did they
 
01:49:51.830 --> 01:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
bring them to court what uh what happens
 
01:49:56.709 --> 01:49:56.719 align:start position:0%
so the the the question is you without
 
01:49:59.629 --> 01:49:59.639 align:start position:0%
this with without this legislation we
 
01:50:02.510 --> 01:50:02.520 align:start position:0%
can just leave it and play it by ear and
 
01:50:04.870 --> 01:50:04.880 align:start position:0%
you know hope that uh if it in in the
 
01:50:06.750 --> 01:50:06.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunate situation that that that
 
01:50:09.629 --> 01:50:09.639 align:start position:0%
that ever happened we'll will'll you
 
01:50:11.470 --> 01:50:11.480 align:start position:0%
know we'll play it by ear what we do and
 
01:50:13.310 --> 01:50:13.320 align:start position:0%
presumably we would be the courts would
 
01:50:14.790 --> 01:50:14.800 align:start position:0%
be playing and at least in New Hampshire
 
01:50:16.430 --> 01:50:16.440 align:start position:0%
would be playing it by ear in terms of
 
01:50:19.270 --> 01:50:19.280 align:start position:0%
what they do or does it make sense to
 
01:50:22.390 --> 01:50:22.400 align:start position:0%
have a procedure specifying what happens
 
01:50:25.109 --> 01:50:25.119 align:start position:0%
and that's what this bill attempts to do
 
01:50:26.870 --> 01:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
um as you'll see by reading it it's you
 
01:50:31.830 --> 01:50:31.840 align:start position:0%
know it it has a whole lot of of uh
 
01:50:33.910 --> 01:50:33.920 align:start position:0%
conditions that have to that have to
 
01:50:37.910 --> 01:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
exist before uh the either the criminal
 
01:50:41.350 --> 01:50:41.360 align:start position:0%
penalty or the Civil uh enforcement
 
01:50:44.910 --> 01:50:44.920 align:start position:0%
procedure can um Can arise it has to it
 
01:50:48.350 --> 01:50:48.360 align:start position:0%
requires you know the uh that that the
 
01:50:50.790 --> 01:50:50.800 align:start position:0%
house or the senate or if it's joint
 
01:50:53.629 --> 01:50:53.639 align:start position:0%
both bodies uh determin that the person
 
01:50:56.430 --> 01:50:56.440 align:start position:0%
is in in contempt that they had no basis
 
01:50:58.430 --> 01:50:58.440 align:start position:0%
for failing you know for failing to
 
01:51:00.830 --> 01:51:00.840 align:start position:0%
comply and there would have to be a a a
 
01:51:04.069 --> 01:51:04.079 align:start position:0%
vote by the entire bodies to to do that
 
01:51:05.830 --> 01:51:05.840 align:start position:0%
and then it would go to the courts and
 
01:51:06.990 --> 01:51:07.000 align:start position:0%
the courts again would have an
 
01:51:10.589 --> 01:51:10.599 align:start position:0%
opportunity to to uh to review that
 
01:51:12.470 --> 01:51:12.480 align:start position:0%
judgment and determine whether there was
 
01:51:15.830 --> 01:51:15.840 align:start position:0%
a valid basis for failing to comply uh
 
01:51:18.910 --> 01:51:18.920 align:start position:0%
this the the criminal penalty that is uh
 
01:51:20.390 --> 01:51:20.400 align:start position:0%
is provided is you know it's a
 
01:51:22.950 --> 01:51:22.960 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor it's it's not uh particular
 
01:51:26.550 --> 01:51:26.560 align:start position:0%
significant uh penalty and the Civil uh
 
01:51:30.270 --> 01:51:30.280 align:start position:0%
penalty uh uh provides that provides
 
01:51:32.430 --> 01:51:32.440 align:start position:0%
that uh there could be a finding of
 
01:51:36.830 --> 01:51:36.840 align:start position:0%
civil contempt and um a an order that
 
01:51:39.149 --> 01:51:39.159 align:start position:0%
the you know at the most extreme in the
 
01:51:40.709 --> 01:51:40.719 align:start position:0%
Civil context would be an order that the
 
01:51:43.390 --> 01:51:43.400 align:start position:0%
person be incarcerated until they comply
 
01:51:47.470 --> 01:51:47.480 align:start position:0%
that's the typical civil contempt uh
 
01:51:53.069 --> 01:51:53.079 align:start position:0%
remedy um so with that um hope you know
 
01:51:53.079 --> 01:51:54.229 align:start position:0%
remedy um so with that um hope you know
hopefully

01:51:54.229 --> 01:51:54.239 align:start position:0%
hopefully
 
01:51:56.910 --> 01:51:56.920 align:start position:0%
this if this became the law it would
 
01:51:59.589 --> 01:51:59.599 align:start position:0%
never come into play because we' never
 
01:52:01.990 --> 01:52:02.000 align:start position:0%
we'd never get to that stage but I
 
01:52:04.390 --> 01:52:04.400 align:start position:0%
suppose it it's better to have it there
 
01:52:06.030 --> 01:52:06.040 align:start position:0%
than not have it there that would be my
 
01:52:08.589 --> 01:52:08.599 align:start position:0%
my sense on I'm happy to answer any
 
01:52:09.990 --> 01:52:10.000 align:start position:0%
questions are there any questions
 
01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:11.430 align:start position:0%
questions are there any questions
representative

01:52:11.430 --> 01:52:11.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:52:14.550 --> 01:52:14.560 align:start position:0%
bur thank you Mr chair and and thank you
 
01:52:18.069 --> 01:52:18.079 align:start position:0%
for your explanation um I I personally
 
01:52:20.870 --> 01:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
tend to agree about the inherent powers
 
01:52:23.990 --> 01:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
but we'll put that aside my question to
 
01:52:26.430 --> 01:52:26.440 align:start position:0%
you is the operation of the on the
 
01:52:30.629 --> 01:52:30.639 align:start position:0%
criminal offense only um understanding
 
01:52:34.229 --> 01:52:34.239 align:start position:0%
the Civil remedies are are fairly
 
01:52:39.350 --> 01:52:39.360 align:start position:0%
traditional so in line four we have what
 
01:52:43.189 --> 01:52:43.199 align:start position:0%
I'll call the wandering uh concept of
 
01:52:48.030 --> 01:52:48.040 align:start position:0%
knowingly and uh folks understand that
 
01:52:51.830 --> 01:52:51.840 align:start position:0%
knowingly uh is a certain state of mind
 
01:52:57.149 --> 01:52:57.159 align:start position:0%
and uh um but when we get down to
 
01:53:00.669 --> 01:53:00.679 align:start position:0%
line8 it's simply you're wrong you
 
01:53:03.669 --> 01:53:03.679 align:start position:0%
didn't have a good reason whether it's
 
01:53:09.470 --> 01:53:09.480 align:start position:0%
knowingly or not um and then you can be
 
01:53:12.750 --> 01:53:12.760 align:start position:0%
found guilty of a misdemeanor so my
 
01:53:16.550 --> 01:53:16.560 align:start position:0%
first question is is has knowingly
 
01:53:18.790 --> 01:53:18.800 align:start position:0%
dropped out of the
 
01:53:23.109 --> 01:53:23.119 align:start position:0%
consideration uh in this uh I in the
 
01:53:25.950 --> 01:53:25.960 align:start position:0%
section I'm not you know what I I I
 
01:53:27.830 --> 01:53:27.840 align:start position:0%
don't I'm not sure I understand it
 
01:53:30.189 --> 01:53:30.199 align:start position:0%
certainly was I think the knowingly my
 
01:53:32.750 --> 01:53:32.760 align:start position:0%
my intention was that it applied to you
 
01:53:34.310 --> 01:53:34.320 align:start position:0%
have to act knowingly but I'm not quite
 
01:53:36.669 --> 01:53:36.679 align:start position:0%
sure I understand where you're saying it
 
01:53:38.390 --> 01:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
you have a question about whether it
 
01:53:41.790 --> 01:53:41.800 align:start position:0%
would apply well in line 8 to
 
01:53:45.709 --> 01:53:45.719 align:start position:0%
nine uh or who having
 
01:53:48.629 --> 01:53:48.639 align:start position:0%
appeared refuses to answer any question
 
01:53:51.510 --> 01:53:51.520 align:start position:0%
or produce any books my question is is
 
01:53:53.069 --> 01:53:53.079 align:start position:0%
that a knowing
 
01:53:55.430 --> 01:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
refusal at that time uh with an
 
01:53:59.069 --> 01:53:59.079 align:start position:0%
explanation sure sure I mean I think I I
 
01:54:01.709 --> 01:54:01.719 align:start position:0%
yes I think knowingly does apply I mean
 
01:54:01.719 --> 01:54:02.870 align:start position:0%
yes I think knowingly does apply I mean
it's

01:54:02.870 --> 01:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:54:05.910 --> 01:54:05.920 align:start position:0%
hard I think certainly the knowingly
 
01:54:08.950 --> 01:54:08.960 align:start position:0%
would I I would intended that to apply
 
01:54:10.709 --> 01:54:10.719 align:start position:0%
there but I I guess what I would I guess
 
01:54:12.069 --> 01:54:12.079 align:start position:0%
what I would say
 
01:54:16.430 --> 01:54:16.440 align:start position:0%
is it you know I I it's hard to imagine
 
01:54:18.069 --> 01:54:18.079 align:start position:0%
how somebody
 
01:54:20.510 --> 01:54:20.520 align:start position:0%
refusing would not be that you don't
 
01:54:23.709 --> 01:54:23.719 align:start position:0%
know you're refusing I mean I that
 
01:54:25.229 --> 01:54:25.239 align:start position:0%
particularly where it says without just
 
01:54:28.510 --> 01:54:28.520 align:start position:0%
cause so if you I mean but if somebody
 
01:54:30.709 --> 01:54:30.719 align:start position:0%
asks you somebody asks you a question
 
01:54:33.629 --> 01:54:33.639 align:start position:0%
and you refuse to answer it's hard to
 
01:54:35.430 --> 01:54:35.440 align:start position:0%
you know I mean I certainly did intend
 
01:54:37.109 --> 01:54:37.119 align:start position:0%
it to be no I suppose somebody could
 
01:54:39.030 --> 01:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
accidentally refuse but that would be
 
01:54:40.750 --> 01:54:40.760 align:start position:0%
you know and and what are the
 
01:54:43.470 --> 01:54:43.480 align:start position:0%
consequences of the guilty of a
 
01:54:46.149 --> 01:54:46.159 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor is there punishment to be
 
01:54:48.510 --> 01:54:48.520 align:start position:0%
followed thereafter are there limits on
 
01:54:48.520 --> 01:54:50.750 align:start position:0%
followed thereafter are there limits on
that

01:54:50.750 --> 01:54:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:53.629 --> 01:54:53.639 align:start position:0%
punishment well would I it it would be a
 
01:54:55.350 --> 01:54:55.360 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor you'll notice it doesn't say
 
01:54:57.589 --> 01:54:57.599 align:start position:0%
a Class A misdemeanor so I suppose it
 
01:55:00.669 --> 01:55:00.679 align:start position:0%
could be um it I I I think it would be
 
01:55:04.910 --> 01:55:04.920 align:start position:0%
subject to the um the the other law
 
01:55:06.910 --> 01:55:06.920 align:start position:0%
which would say since it this presumably
 
01:55:09.830 --> 01:55:09.840 align:start position:0%
is not a violent this is not a violent
 
01:55:12.990 --> 01:55:13.000 align:start position:0%
offense so unless the the
 
01:55:15.229 --> 01:55:15.239 align:start position:0%
prosecutor uh gave notice that they
 
01:55:17.510 --> 01:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
intended it to be treated as a Class A
 
01:55:19.350 --> 01:55:19.360 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor it would be a Class B
 
01:55:19.360 --> 01:55:23.390 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor it would be a Class B
misdemeanor

01:55:23.390 --> 01:55:23.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:26.270 --> 01:55:26.280 align:start position:0%
and the consequences of followup
 
01:55:28.790 --> 01:55:28.800 align:start position:0%
followup and the consequences other than
 
01:55:32.790 --> 01:55:32.800 align:start position:0%
on your record of a Class B misdemeanor
 
01:55:36.310 --> 01:55:36.320 align:start position:0%
would be limited to what class Class B
 
01:55:38.350 --> 01:55:38.360 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor there's no jail time I think
 
01:55:41.149 --> 01:55:41.159 align:start position:0%
where the fine is uh is it I I think
 
01:55:43.510 --> 01:55:43.520 align:start position:0%
it's $1,200 is the maximum fine unless
 
01:55:47.589 --> 01:55:47.599 align:start position:0%
it it may have changed since I was was
 
01:55:49.589 --> 01:55:49.599 align:start position:0%
more intimately familiar with that but I
 
01:55:51.830 --> 01:55:51.840 align:start position:0%
it's no jail time I think it's $1,200
 
01:55:55.109 --> 01:55:55.119 align:start position:0%
maximum fine thank you representative
 
01:55:57.430 --> 01:55:57.440 align:start position:0%
tur yeah thank you and thanks for the
 
01:56:00.030 --> 01:56:00.040 align:start position:0%
question uh taking the question
 
01:56:03.069 --> 01:56:03.079 align:start position:0%
um I guess I'm wondering from what I
 
01:56:05.229 --> 01:56:05.239 align:start position:0%
understood from the incident last year
 
01:56:06.350 --> 01:56:06.360 align:start position:0%
and from your
 
01:56:08.750 --> 01:56:08.760 align:start position:0%
opening uh committees by themselves in
 
01:56:11.629 --> 01:56:11.639 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire can't issue subpoenas
 
01:56:17.069 --> 01:56:17.079 align:start position:0%
without going through the general court
 
01:56:19.830 --> 01:56:19.840 align:start position:0%
that's that's what I I mean first of all
 
01:56:21.950 --> 01:56:21.960 align:start position:0%
I never thought about until this whole
 
01:56:21.960 --> 01:56:22.750 align:start position:0%
I never thought about until this whole
incident

01:56:22.750 --> 01:56:22.760 align:start position:0%
incident
 
01:56:24.069 --> 01:56:24.079 align:start position:0%
issued you know the idea of issuing
 
01:56:26.390 --> 01:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
subpoenas for was never something that
 
01:56:30.470 --> 01:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
was on my radar screen right I I think
 
01:56:32.709 --> 01:56:32.719 align:start position:0%
that that that you are right but
 
01:56:36.109 --> 01:56:36.119 align:start position:0%
apparently there you know there
 
01:56:40.069 --> 01:56:40.079 align:start position:0%
was a not insubstantial group of people
 
01:56:45.790 --> 01:56:45.800 align:start position:0%
who didn't share that view of uh um so
 
01:56:50.430 --> 01:56:50.440 align:start position:0%
I'll can I do fall um yeah so uh and my
 
01:56:51.550 --> 01:56:51.560 align:start position:0%
understanding is that that you're not
 
01:56:54.350 --> 01:56:54.360 align:start position:0%
trying to either to clarify that in any
 
01:56:56.589 --> 01:56:56.599 align:start position:0%
way this is this is basically what
 
01:56:58.229 --> 01:56:58.239 align:start position:0%
happens if someone doesn't follow
 
01:57:00.229 --> 01:57:00.239 align:start position:0%
exactly exact this is not this doesn't
 
01:57:01.790 --> 01:57:01.800 align:start position:0%
you'll notice there's no reference to
 
01:57:04.990 --> 01:57:05.000 align:start position:0%
subpoena anywhere in here it's just it's
 
01:57:07.149 --> 01:57:07.159 align:start position:0%
about is referenced online well I'm no
 
01:57:09.149 --> 01:57:09.159 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I'm sorry in terms of in terms
 
01:57:11.069 --> 01:57:11.079 align:start position:0%
of how when a subpoena should be issued
 
01:57:12.669 --> 01:57:12.679 align:start position:0%
or anything like that it's what happens
 
01:57:14.870 --> 01:57:14.880 align:start position:0%
if you don't if it is issued and you
 
01:57:17.550 --> 01:57:17.560 align:start position:0%
don't comply so one more one more follow
 
01:57:19.550 --> 01:57:19.560 align:start position:0%
sorry um so I guess what what I'm
 
01:57:22.550 --> 01:57:22.560 align:start position:0%
wondering is the way it's worded like uh
 
01:57:25.109 --> 01:57:25.119 align:start position:0%
on line five it says you know comply
 
01:57:28.149 --> 01:57:28.159 align:start position:0%
with a subpoena duly issued and served
 
01:57:31.470 --> 01:57:31.480 align:start position:0%
um by either House of the general court
 
01:57:33.430 --> 01:57:33.440 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering all the stuff after it
 
01:57:35.990 --> 01:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
seems to imply that that committees do
 
01:57:40.109 --> 01:57:40.119 align:start position:0%
have subpoena power sort of uh by
 
01:57:43.310 --> 01:57:43.320 align:start position:0%
reference under under this this larger
 
01:57:45.270 --> 01:57:45.280 align:start position:0%
statement I'm wondering does that all
 
01:57:47.030 --> 01:57:47.040 align:start position:0%
need to be there because it seems to
 
01:57:48.669 --> 01:57:48.679 align:start position:0%
confuse the issue rather than just
 
01:57:51.629 --> 01:57:51.639 align:start position:0%
saying a subpoena duly issued by either
 
01:57:54.030 --> 01:57:54.040 align:start position:0%
House of the General Court does that
 
01:57:55.589 --> 01:57:55.599 align:start position:0%
point does that is that clear what I you
 
01:57:58.189 --> 01:57:58.199 align:start position:0%
know no it is but you know what I I I
 
01:58:00.709 --> 01:58:00.719 align:start position:0%
took this part of the language I did
 
01:58:03.510 --> 01:58:03.520 align:start position:0%
take from the federal statute I think
 
01:58:09.109 --> 01:58:09.119 align:start position:0%
it's no 2 USC something um um and I and
 
01:58:11.669 --> 01:58:11.679 align:start position:0%
I think the the language you know it it
 
01:58:13.270 --> 01:58:13.280 align:start position:0%
you're right it is long you know there's
 
01:58:17.069 --> 01:58:17.079 align:start position:0%
a lot of different Clauses a joint
 
01:58:19.550 --> 01:58:19.560 align:start position:0%
committee and that I took out of the
 
01:58:22.149 --> 01:58:22.159 align:start position:0%
federal statute because I think it's it
 
01:58:24.310 --> 01:58:24.320 align:start position:0%
it's designed to kind of
 
01:58:27.149 --> 01:58:27.159 align:start position:0%
capture a number of situations in other
 
01:58:29.709 --> 01:58:29.719 align:start position:0%
words a CO a committee of the house or a
 
01:58:31.430 --> 01:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
committee of the senate or a joint
 
01:58:33.350 --> 01:58:33.360 align:start position:0%
committee if there were such a committee
 
01:58:36.669 --> 01:58:36.679 align:start position:0%
but I think all of the the the critical
 
01:58:40.950 --> 01:58:40.960 align:start position:0%
language is subpoena duly issued so that
 
01:58:43.229 --> 01:58:43.239 align:start position:0%
I think what that what that which really
 
01:58:44.709 --> 01:58:44.719 align:start position:0%
I think applies to everything that
 
01:58:48.390 --> 01:58:48.400 align:start position:0%
follows so that the whether the subpoena
 
01:58:51.270 --> 01:58:51.280 align:start position:0%
was duly issued is did it was it issued
 
01:58:54.189 --> 01:58:54.199 align:start position:0%
in in a accordance with the rules of
 
01:58:56.430 --> 01:58:56.440 align:start position:0%
either the house or the senate or if it
 
01:58:58.109 --> 01:58:58.119 align:start position:0%
was a joint committee presumably the
 
01:58:59.709 --> 01:58:59.719 align:start position:0%
rules of both
 
01:59:02.790 --> 01:59:02.800 align:start position:0%
bodies yeah to to just just clarifying I
 
01:59:04.990 --> 01:59:05.000 align:start position:0%
I I that's what I was wondering is is
 
01:59:07.189 --> 01:59:07.199 align:start position:0%
this some I don't know whether there is
 
01:59:09.470 --> 01:59:09.480 align:start position:0%
something that spells out what's a duly
 
01:59:12.390 --> 01:59:12.400 align:start position:0%
issued subpoena by the general court or
 
01:59:14.910 --> 01:59:14.920 align:start position:0%
or either either body but it feels like
 
01:59:17.310 --> 01:59:17.320 align:start position:0%
adding all that extra language seems to
 
01:59:21.069 --> 01:59:21.079 align:start position:0%
imply a definition of of all that which
 
01:59:23.870 --> 01:59:23.880 align:start position:0%
I wasn't sure was consistent with the
 
01:59:27.669 --> 01:59:27.679 align:start position:0%
rule that may or may not exist for doing
 
01:59:32.750 --> 01:59:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:37.430 --> 01:59:37.440 align:start position:0%
it I don't I don't think that it I don't
 
01:59:38.790 --> 01:59:38.800 align:start position:0%
think that it does do that I think it
 
01:59:41.990 --> 01:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
just basically it it all the all the
 
01:59:43.990 --> 01:59:44.000 align:start position:0%
language after duly issued is B
 
01:59:46.350 --> 01:59:46.360 align:start position:0%
basically designed to cover you know
 
01:59:50.030 --> 01:59:50.040 align:start position:0%
what the what the uh what the subpoena
 
01:59:52.990 --> 01:59:53.000 align:start position:0%
if it was duly issued might might cover
 
01:59:54.430 --> 01:59:54.440 align:start position:0%
like a subpoena for Testimony or
 
01:59:55.910 --> 01:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
subpoena for books or documents or
 
01:59:58.350 --> 01:59:58.360 align:start position:0%
records and what who would be issuing it
 
02:00:01.589 --> 02:00:01.599 align:start position:0%
would be you know I mean what in what
 
02:00:03.030 --> 02:00:03.040 align:start position:0%
proceeding was it issued in connection
 
02:00:05.310 --> 02:00:05.320 align:start position:0%
with a house a house committee a senate
 
02:00:07.790 --> 02:00:07.800 align:start position:0%
committee a joint committee maybe the
 
02:00:10.430 --> 02:00:10.440 align:start position:0%
full body of either one I I suppose it
 
02:00:12.149 --> 02:00:12.159 align:start position:0%
would it could cover any of those but in
 
02:00:14.189 --> 02:00:14.199 align:start position:0%
terms of
 
02:00:16.830 --> 02:00:16.840 align:start position:0%
whether you know the the prerequisite
 
02:00:19.030 --> 02:00:19.040 align:start position:0%
that is a duly issued subpoena that
 
02:00:21.069 --> 02:00:21.079 align:start position:0%
would depend on the rules and I I do
 
02:00:24.589 --> 02:00:24.599 align:start position:0%
agree with you that right now the rule
 
02:00:28.589 --> 02:00:28.599 align:start position:0%
at least the rules of the house
 
02:00:31.470 --> 02:00:31.480 align:start position:0%
are you know let me let me put they
 
02:00:33.310 --> 02:00:33.320 align:start position:0%
could be clearer than they are that's
 
02:00:36.550 --> 02:00:36.560 align:start position:0%
for sure
 
02:00:39.669 --> 02:00:39.679 align:start position:0%
um any other questions representative
 
02:00:42.229 --> 02:00:42.239 align:start position:0%
Manos thank you Mr Vice chair and thank
 
02:00:44.750 --> 02:00:44.760 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question I wanted to
 
02:00:50.589 --> 02:00:50.599 align:start position:0%
um discuss lines 13 and 14 and also line
 
02:00:55.229 --> 02:00:55.239 align:start position:0%
26 and I wasn't clear on you have
 
02:00:58.629 --> 02:00:58.639 align:start position:0%
failure to comply as being a
 
02:01:01.030 --> 02:01:01.040 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor excuse me but then a
 
02:01:02.870 --> 02:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
prosecution would be in the superior
 
02:01:05.430 --> 02:01:05.440 align:start position:0%
court for maram County right and I was
 
02:01:08.350 --> 02:01:08.360 align:start position:0%
confused about why a misdemeanor would
 
02:01:10.430 --> 02:01:10.440 align:start position:0%
specifically go to the Superior Court
 
02:01:13.069 --> 02:01:13.079 align:start position:0%
rather than the circuit court and then I
 
02:01:17.629 --> 02:01:17.639 align:start position:0%
also wanted to ask about line 26 and the
 
02:01:20.430 --> 02:01:20.440 align:start position:0%
potential conflict between a criminal
 
02:01:23.229 --> 02:01:23.239 align:start position:0%
prosecution being in the circuit Court
 
02:01:25.870 --> 02:01:25.880 align:start position:0%
um versus civil being in the superior
 
02:01:28.830 --> 02:01:28.840 align:start position:0%
court so basically what I what I
 
02:01:33.069 --> 02:01:33.079 align:start position:0%
intended to do with both of these is to
 
02:01:37.550 --> 02:01:37.560 align:start position:0%
to limit the place where the prosecution
 
02:01:39.589 --> 02:01:39.599 align:start position:0%
be could be brought and limit the
 
02:01:41.629 --> 02:01:41.639 align:start position:0%
prosecutor so for the in the criminal
 
02:01:44.790 --> 02:01:44.800 align:start position:0%
case it it it it I that was an
 
02:01:46.709 --> 02:01:46.719 align:start position:0%
intentional decision to make even though
 
02:01:48.669 --> 02:01:48.679 align:start position:0%
it's a misdemeanor to make it have to be
 
02:01:52.709 --> 02:01:52.719 align:start position:0%
prosecuted in the Superior Court uh
 
02:01:55.430 --> 02:01:55.440 align:start position:0%
because you know this uh this is this
 
02:01:58.550 --> 02:01:58.560 align:start position:0%
would be an unu such a prosecution would
 
02:02:01.510 --> 02:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
be a very unusual procedure it seems to
 
02:02:03.629 --> 02:02:03.639 align:start position:0%
me it would be better to have such a pro
 
02:02:05.709 --> 02:02:05.719 align:start position:0%
such a prosecution to be in the Superior
 
02:02:07.629 --> 02:02:07.639 align:start position:0%
Court since it would have to you know
 
02:02:09.390 --> 02:02:09.400 align:start position:0%
since it would involve the legislature
 
02:02:11.589 --> 02:02:11.599 align:start position:0%
which sits un conquered marac County
 
02:02:14.030 --> 02:02:14.040 align:start position:0%
limiting it to marac County seemed to me
 
02:02:17.589 --> 02:02:17.599 align:start position:0%
to be another way to circumscribe this
 
02:02:20.990 --> 02:02:21.000 align:start position:0%
and also requiring that it not be that
 
02:02:22.750 --> 02:02:22.760 align:start position:0%
if it that the proc ution if it's going
 
02:02:25.069 --> 02:02:25.079 align:start position:0%
to be undertaken would be undertaken by
 
02:02:26.589 --> 02:02:26.599 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office rather
 
02:02:28.910 --> 02:02:28.920 align:start position:0%
than a county attorney all of those
 
02:02:32.589 --> 02:02:32.599 align:start position:0%
things are designed to kind of
 
02:02:36.430 --> 02:02:36.440 align:start position:0%
limit to recognize that this would be a
 
02:02:38.550 --> 02:02:38.560 align:start position:0%
in some sense an extraordinary
 
02:02:40.830 --> 02:02:40.840 align:start position:0%
prosecution and for those reasons should
 
02:02:42.669 --> 02:02:42.679 align:start position:0%
be limited to where it's brought who can
 
02:02:45.709 --> 02:02:45.719 align:start position:0%
bring it and what court is
 
02:02:49.950 --> 02:02:49.960 align:start position:0%
in follow um then would it not make more
 
02:02:52.910 --> 02:02:52.920 align:start position:0%
sense for it to be for for violation to
 
02:02:56.149 --> 02:02:56.159 align:start position:0%
be a felony rather than a
 
02:03:00.510 --> 02:03:00.520 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor well uh I mean I I guess I
 
02:03:03.910 --> 02:03:03.920 align:start position:0%
would say you
 
02:03:07.229 --> 02:03:07.239 align:start position:0%
know I I would say no I would say that
 
02:03:09.550 --> 02:03:09.560 align:start position:0%
you don't want
 
02:03:12.270 --> 02:03:12.280 align:start position:0%
to I mean it it seems to me that the
 
02:03:14.470 --> 02:03:14.480 align:start position:0%
light that the kind of situation we're
 
02:03:16.709 --> 02:03:16.719 align:start position:0%
talking about here of somebody being
 
02:03:19.589 --> 02:03:19.599 align:start position:0%
held in contempt of the legis you know
 
02:03:22.470 --> 02:03:22.480 align:start position:0%
of the of the general court
 
02:03:24.990 --> 02:03:25.000 align:start position:0%
very very rare if ever you know we're
 
02:03:27.629 --> 02:03:27.639 align:start position:0%
going to see such a situation and if
 
02:03:30.750 --> 02:03:30.760 align:start position:0%
there was one my inclination would be
 
02:03:34.390 --> 02:03:34.400 align:start position:0%
that that the the the prospect of being
 
02:03:35.629 --> 02:03:35.639 align:start position:0%
convicted of a
 
02:03:38.189 --> 02:03:38.199 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor um which arguably could turn
 
02:03:40.229 --> 02:03:40.239 align:start position:0%
into a Class A misdemeanor where it
 
02:03:41.830 --> 02:03:41.840 align:start position:0%
would be up to a year in jail that would
 
02:03:46.430 --> 02:03:46.440 align:start position:0%
be enough deterrence to uh to uh get the
 
02:03:48.549 --> 02:03:48.559 align:start position:0%
job done so I would be opposed to making
 
02:03:51.189 --> 02:03:51.199 align:start position:0%
it anything more harsh than that
 
02:03:51.199 --> 02:03:53.270 align:start position:0%
it anything more harsh than that
representative

02:03:53.270 --> 02:03:53.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:03:55.350 --> 02:03:55.360 align:start position:0%
thank you very much could you tell me
 
02:03:59.830 --> 02:03:59.840 align:start position:0%
how this relates to rule 28 of uh the
 
02:04:01.549 --> 02:04:01.559 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire House of Representatives
 
02:04:05.750 --> 02:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
rules it well I I think what the way it
 
02:04:07.270 --> 02:04:07.280 align:start position:0%
relates is
 
02:04:12.350 --> 02:04:12.360 align:start position:0%
this rule 28 has a procedure I mean I I
 
02:04:13.709 --> 02:04:13.719 align:start position:0%
assume that I assume I don't have the
 
02:04:15.350 --> 02:04:15.360 align:start position:0%
rules in front of me but I assume 28 is
 
02:04:16.870 --> 02:04:16.880 align:start position:0%
the one that talks about subpoenas is
 
02:04:19.149 --> 02:04:19.159 align:start position:0%
that am I correct on that yes it's it's
 
02:04:21.510 --> 02:04:21.520 align:start position:0%
relevant right right no no no so I I
 
02:04:24.950 --> 02:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
think I think what what the way it
 
02:04:28.350 --> 02:04:28.360 align:start position:0%
relates is this this
 
02:04:33.629 --> 02:04:33.639 align:start position:0%
statute says what happens if the s a
 
02:04:37.549 --> 02:04:37.559 align:start position:0%
subpoena issued pursuant to that rule is
 
02:04:40.390 --> 02:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
served and somebody doesn't comply with
 
02:04:43.109 --> 02:04:43.119 align:start position:0%
the subpoena right now the rule doesn't
 
02:04:44.750 --> 02:04:44.760 align:start position:0%
say anything about it that says you know
 
02:04:46.510 --> 02:04:46.520 align:start position:0%
it talks about when a subpoena can be
 
02:04:50.430 --> 02:04:50.440 align:start position:0%
issued and it doesn't say that that's
 
02:04:52.709 --> 02:04:52.719 align:start position:0%
where it ends so is issued under the
 
02:04:55.069 --> 02:04:55.079 align:start position:0%
rule okay now what happens could I have
 
02:04:58.790 --> 02:04:58.800 align:start position:0%
one followup y uh thank you very much um
 
02:05:01.270 --> 02:05:01.280 align:start position:0%
I asked uh because of the thoughtful
 
02:05:02.669 --> 02:05:02.679 align:start position:0%
question that our colleague
 
02:05:08.470 --> 02:05:08.480 align:start position:0%
representative tur raised um I um am I
 
02:05:12.910 --> 02:05:12.920 align:start position:0%
incorrect in saying that the house rules
 
02:05:17.629 --> 02:05:17.639 align:start position:0%
say that a subpoena can be issued only
 
02:05:20.589 --> 02:05:20.599 align:start position:0%
by a vote of the Full House and that
 
02:05:23.830 --> 02:05:23.840 align:start position:0%
would be act one so to speak in this
 
02:05:27.709 --> 02:05:27.719 align:start position:0%
drama and then act two is if there was a
 
02:05:31.750 --> 02:05:31.760 align:start position:0%
failure to comply but act one is already
 
02:05:34.629 --> 02:05:34.639 align:start position:0%
in our house rules is that not true oh
 
02:05:36.430 --> 02:05:36.440 align:start position:0%
no no that I I think that's right I
 
02:05:39.750 --> 02:05:39.760 align:start position:0%
think as I said I I think I would read
 
02:05:43.270 --> 02:05:43.280 align:start position:0%
rule 28 the same way that you and
 
02:05:47.790 --> 02:05:47.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:50.950 --> 02:05:50.960 align:start position:0%
28 some people apparently had a very
 
02:05:53.870 --> 02:05:53.880 align:start position:0%
different View of what rule how rule 28
 
02:05:56.149 --> 02:05:56.159 align:start position:0%
should be read but I think I agree with
 
02:05:58.830 --> 02:05:58.840 align:start position:0%
you I I think you're right but I I think
 
02:06:01.669 --> 02:06:01.679 align:start position:0%
what that whole incident
 
02:06:04.390 --> 02:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
raised you know I I suppose maybe you
 
02:06:07.870 --> 02:06:07.880 align:start position:0%
know there's a there's a um there's a
 
02:06:11.589 --> 02:06:11.599 align:start position:0%
gray of sunlight in every uh in in every
 
02:06:17.310 --> 02:06:17.320 align:start position:0%
cloudy situation um is the what okay so
 
02:06:19.669 --> 02:06:19.679 align:start position:0%
let's assume that we we we actually get
 
02:06:22.109 --> 02:06:22.119 align:start position:0%
to the position of issuing a subo
 
02:06:24.069 --> 02:06:24.079 align:start position:0%
and somebody doesn't comply then what
 
02:06:26.350 --> 02:06:26.360 align:start position:0%
happens and that's what this is designed
 
02:06:29.470 --> 02:06:29.480 align:start position:0%
to could I be in one more short one you
 
02:06:30.910 --> 02:06:30.920 align:start position:0%
don't you could say no you know no you
 
02:06:32.189 --> 02:06:32.199 align:start position:0%
can you can certainly do that you could
 
02:06:36.149 --> 02:06:36.159 align:start position:0%
say no to me um I think you know Mr
 
02:06:40.390 --> 02:06:40.400 align:start position:0%
chair that I uh resist always uh
 
02:06:43.750 --> 02:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
references to People by party and making
 
02:06:47.390 --> 02:06:47.400 align:start position:0%
considerations by party but I must uh
 
02:06:50.750 --> 02:06:50.760 align:start position:0%
ask you is there a reason why there is
 
02:06:54.470 --> 02:06:54.480 align:start position:0%
one senator listed um as a sponsor but
 
02:06:57.470 --> 02:06:57.480 align:start position:0%
there are no Democrats in the house or
 
02:06:59.870 --> 02:06:59.880 align:start position:0%
the Senate is this perceived to be
 
02:07:02.990 --> 02:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
something that is of concern only to
 
02:07:06.350 --> 02:07:06.360 align:start position:0%
Republicans in the
 
02:07:09.149 --> 02:07:09.159 align:start position:0%
house well I mean it's
 
02:07:12.750 --> 02:07:12.760 align:start position:0%
certainly the the generation of this and
 
02:07:14.310 --> 02:07:14.320 align:start position:0%
the you know I talked about the the
 
02:07:15.910 --> 02:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
speaker and the deputy speaker and
 
02:07:20.830 --> 02:07:20.840 align:start position:0%
myself I mean the generation of this um
 
02:07:22.549 --> 02:07:22.559 align:start position:0%
uh was C certainly something that was
 
02:07:25.910 --> 02:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
talked about in my caucus and my caucus
 
02:07:30.390 --> 02:07:30.400 align:start position:0%
was the one that um proposed this um and
 
02:07:34.310 --> 02:07:34.320 align:start position:0%
so that that was you know I just no I no
 
02:07:35.430 --> 02:07:35.440 align:start position:0%
but I think no it's a legitimate
 
02:07:38.830 --> 02:07:38.840 align:start position:0%
question I I I frankly did not um and I
 
02:07:42.589 --> 02:07:42.599 align:start position:0%
and and I think that the I I I assume
 
02:07:44.030 --> 02:07:44.040 align:start position:0%
that this is true of the speaker and the
 
02:07:46.149 --> 02:07:46.159 align:start position:0%
deputy speaker didn't you know didn't
 
02:07:49.430 --> 02:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
think to to to ask uh members of the of
 
02:07:53.430 --> 02:07:53.440 align:start position:0%
the other party and I I
 
02:07:56.069 --> 02:07:56.079 align:start position:0%
yeah any other questions representative
 
02:07:58.990 --> 02:07:59.000 align:start position:0%
Burch just a quick question of
 
02:08:01.669 --> 02:08:01.679 align:start position:0%
clarification uh based on your your
 
02:08:05.350 --> 02:08:05.360 align:start position:0%
response to representative monos the the
 
02:08:08.310 --> 02:08:08.320 align:start position:0%
prosecution by the Department of Justice
 
02:08:10.350 --> 02:08:10.360 align:start position:0%
would that be
 
02:08:12.350 --> 02:08:12.360 align:start position:0%
discretionary with the Department of
 
02:08:15.030 --> 02:08:15.040 align:start position:0%
Justice to bring it or is that mandatory
 
02:08:16.750 --> 02:08:16.760 align:start position:0%
because the house has taken a certain
 
02:08:18.950 --> 02:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
action I think I there's nothing no
 
02:08:21.830 --> 02:08:21.840 align:start position:0%
language I don't I don't think that the
 
02:08:25.069 --> 02:08:25.079 align:start position:0%
Le the legislature could compel the
 
02:08:27.870 --> 02:08:27.880 align:start position:0%
executive branch to bring a prosecution
 
02:08:29.870 --> 02:08:29.880 align:start position:0%
um we might be really upset if they
 
02:08:31.990 --> 02:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
didn't maybe that would have some effect
 
02:08:33.870 --> 02:08:33.880 align:start position:0%
on their budget but I don't think that
 
02:08:35.390 --> 02:08:35.400 align:start position:0%
we could I don't think that we could
 
02:08:37.709 --> 02:08:37.719 align:start position:0%
compel the executive branch to bring a
 
02:08:39.790 --> 02:08:39.800 align:start position:0%
prosecution thank you I just wanted to
 
02:08:41.109 --> 02:08:41.119 align:start position:0%
make sure that was part of the right I
 
02:08:42.910 --> 02:08:42.920 align:start position:0%
mean that's another reason to limit this
 
02:08:44.790 --> 02:08:44.800 align:start position:0%
to the Department of Justice because it
 
02:08:47.149 --> 02:08:47.159 align:start position:0%
it makes sure that you know it's not
 
02:08:48.750 --> 02:08:48.760 align:start position:0%
going to be brought by a county attorney
 
02:08:49.950 --> 02:08:49.960 align:start position:0%
if it's going to be brought at all it's
 
02:08:51.549 --> 02:08:51.559 align:start position:0%
going to be the Department of Justice
 
02:08:54.669 --> 02:08:54.679 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions seeing
 
02:08:57.350 --> 02:08:57.360 align:start position:0%

02:08:59.310 --> 02:08:59.320 align:start position:0%

right all right sorry thank you Mr chair
 
02:10:09.270 --> 02:10:09.280 align:start position:0%
members of the committee um there are
 
02:10:12.149 --> 02:10:12.159 align:start position:0%
two bills that we've listed for hearing
 
02:10:17.390 --> 02:10:17.400 align:start position:0%
that are are uh uh deal with privacy
 
02:10:21.910 --> 02:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
195 is last year's House Bill 314
 
02:10:26.189 --> 02:10:26.199 align:start position:0%
scene which passed the
 
02:10:28.510 --> 02:10:28.520 align:start position:0%
house and
 
02:10:30.910 --> 02:10:30.920 align:start position:0%
I somebody's gonna have to correct
 
02:10:32.270 --> 02:10:32.280 align:start position:0%
representative Smith you may correct me
 
02:10:36.109 --> 02:10:36.119 align:start position:0%
if I'm wrong I believe it it was it died
 
02:10:38.229 --> 02:10:38.239 align:start position:0%
in the Senate that's my recollection is
 
02:10:43.430 --> 02:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:46.430 --> 02:10:46.440 align:start position:0%
so my recollection again I stand to be
 
02:10:48.310 --> 02:10:48.320 align:start position:0%
corrected by those of you who were here
 
02:10:53.189 --> 02:10:53.199 align:start position:0%
last year is that 195
 
02:10:56.950 --> 02:10:56.960 align:start position:0%
is the same bill as 314 last year and
 
02:11:01.589 --> 02:11:01.599 align:start position:0%
that it passed this committee and pass
 
02:11:04.030 --> 02:11:04.040 align:start position:0%
in the house on a bipartisan
 
02:11:08.709 --> 02:11:08.719 align:start position:0%
basis um and what it was and still is
 
02:11:10.950 --> 02:11:10.960 align:start position:0%
intended to do is to
 
02:11:14.310 --> 02:11:14.320 align:start position:0%
be something of a supplement to Senate
 
02:11:17.589 --> 02:11:17.599 align:start position:0%
Bill 255 which was the
 
02:11:21.750 --> 02:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
broader privacy bill that was passed
 
02:11:25.990 --> 02:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
um two years ago um and the
 
02:11:30.629 --> 02:11:30.639 align:start position:0%
the the way that this bill differs from
 
02:11:36.069 --> 02:11:36.079 align:start position:0%
255 is first of all this is a disclosure
 
02:11:40.510 --> 02:11:40.520 align:start position:0%
bill it Deals Only with the disclosing
 
02:11:44.109 --> 02:11:44.119 align:start position:0%
of information it doesn't unlike
 
02:11:47.350 --> 02:11:47.360 align:start position:0%
255 it doesn't have really much to do
 
02:11:51.270 --> 02:11:51.280 align:start position:0%
with the acquisition of information it's
 
02:11:54.750 --> 02:11:54.760 align:start position:0%
only the disclosure of information and
 
02:11:57.750 --> 02:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
it basically says that
 
02:11:57.760 --> 02:12:00.510 align:start position:0%
it basically says that
for

02:12:00.510 --> 02:12:00.520 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:12:02.589 --> 02:12:02.599 align:start position:0%
um a
 
02:12:07.069 --> 02:12:07.079 align:start position:0%
limited uh category of of uh
 
02:12:09.870 --> 02:12:09.880 align:start position:0%
organizations referred to as third-party

providers of information and services
 
02:12:15.149 --> 02:12:15.159 align:start position:0%
and the important thing to understand is
 
02:12:17.950 --> 02:12:17.960 align:start position:0%
that in the definition of third-party
 
02:12:20.109 --> 02:12:20.119 align:start position:0%
provider of information and services
 
02:12:21.669 --> 02:12:21.679 align:start position:0%
that is
 
02:12:23.990 --> 02:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
a narrower definition than the
 
02:12:26.270 --> 02:12:26.280 align:start position:0%
definition of the of the various
 
02:12:28.470 --> 02:12:28.480 align:start position:0%
businesses that would be covered by
 
02:12:34.950 --> 02:12:34.960 align:start position:0%
255 it is um limited to um organizations
 
02:12:37.069 --> 02:12:37.079 align:start position:0%
that collect uh information about a

companies it's designed basically to
cover

02:13:02.350 --> 02:13:02.360 align:start position:0%
cover
 
02:13:04.950 --> 02:13:04.960 align:start position:0%
those those kind of
 
02:13:07.229 --> 02:13:07.239 align:start position:0%
Institutions rather
 
02:13:09.470 --> 02:13:09.480 align:start position:0%
than more
 
02:13:14.109 --> 02:13:14.119 align:start position:0%
broadly um all businesses which is or at
 
02:13:15.870 --> 02:13:15.880 align:start position:0%
least all businesses of a certain size
 
02:13:19.030 --> 02:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
which is what 255 cover and it basically
 
02:13:22.030 --> 02:13:22.040 align:start position:0%
is designed to say if you you are one of
 
02:13:24.030 --> 02:13:24.040 align:start position:0%
those covered
 
02:13:28.069 --> 02:13:28.079 align:start position:0%
institutions then you can't
 
02:13:30.229 --> 02:13:30.239 align:start position:0%
disclose personal
 
02:13:34.149 --> 02:13:34.159 align:start position:0%
information um as defined in the um in
 
02:13:38.669 --> 02:13:38.679 align:start position:0%
the statute um unless you have the
 
02:13:41.350 --> 02:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
consent and the
 
02:13:47.510 --> 02:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
consent has to be affirmative consent um
 
02:13:51.149 --> 02:13:51.159 align:start position:0%
255 um
 
02:13:54.390 --> 02:13:54.400 align:start position:0%
basically has sort of a
 
02:13:57.950 --> 02:13:57.960 align:start position:0%
um an opt out for lack of a better term
 
02:14:01.629 --> 02:14:01.639 align:start position:0%
an opt out feature that you can opt out
 
02:14:03.870 --> 02:14:03.880 align:start position:0%
of of
 
02:14:06.910 --> 02:14:06.920 align:start position:0%
uh having personal information
 
02:14:11.790 --> 02:14:11.800 align:start position:0%
disclosed um but this bill provides more
 
02:14:14.189 --> 02:14:14.199 align:start position:0%
protection in that it requires that you
 
02:14:17.310 --> 02:14:17.320 align:start position:0%
affirmatively agree and that there's
 
02:14:20.790 --> 02:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
requirements that it has to be um you
 
02:14:22.589 --> 02:14:22.599 align:start position:0%
know can't be some getting your
 
02:14:25.390 --> 02:14:25.400 align:start position:0%
affirmative agreement in some sort of
 
02:14:27.310 --> 02:14:27.320 align:start position:0%
Nefarious way that you where you're not
 
02:14:28.830 --> 02:14:28.840 align:start position:0%
likely to think about it's got to be an
 
02:14:31.229 --> 02:14:31.239 align:start position:0%
affirmative you the communication is
 
02:14:33.069 --> 02:14:33.079 align:start position:0%
sent to you do you consent to doing this
 
02:14:35.589 --> 02:14:35.599 align:start position:0%
and you and you agree affirmatively to
 
02:14:38.430 --> 02:14:38.440 align:start position:0%
do that so that's one way and then the
 
02:14:42.870 --> 02:14:42.880 align:start position:0%
bill has a number of of uh of uh other
 
02:14:45.830 --> 02:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
instances in which a some a covered
 
02:14:48.229 --> 02:14:48.239 align:start position:0%
businesses can disclose
 
02:14:53.629 --> 02:14:53.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:56.510 --> 02:14:56.520 align:start position:0%
um Can disclo can disclose information
 
02:14:58.270 --> 02:14:58.280 align:start position:0%
that is personal information in certain
 
02:15:00.870 --> 02:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
circumstances and I want to uh in the
 
02:15:03.350 --> 02:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
interest of of being brief I I I know
 
02:15:04.990 --> 02:15:05.000 align:start position:0%
that there are other people that will be
 
02:15:07.229 --> 02:15:07.239 align:start position:0%
testifying one of the things that that
 
02:15:09.629 --> 02:15:09.639 align:start position:0%
someone expressed one of the sort of a
 
02:15:11.790 --> 02:15:11.800 align:start position:0%
business an industry representative
 
02:15:16.069 --> 02:15:16.079 align:start position:0%
expressed a concern to me about was
 
02:15:19.830 --> 02:15:19.840 align:start position:0%
uh did the does the does the bill as
 
02:15:19.840 --> 02:15:21.350 align:start position:0%
uh did the does the does the bill as
worded

02:15:21.350 --> 02:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
worded
 
02:15:24.870 --> 02:15:24.880 align:start position:0%
allow um one of the covered entities to
 
02:15:27.149 --> 02:15:27.159 align:start position:0%
disclose information if they have reason
 
02:15:29.589 --> 02:15:29.599 align:start position:0%
to believe that there's been some
 
02:15:32.270 --> 02:15:32.280 align:start position:0%
nefarious activity going on and and that
 
02:15:34.830 --> 02:15:34.840 align:start position:0%
the person that talked to me was sort of
 
02:15:36.149 --> 02:15:36.159 align:start position:0%
said they they were concerned that the
 
02:15:38.470 --> 02:15:38.480 align:start position:0%
bill did not allow that I think that
 
02:15:40.149 --> 02:15:40.159 align:start position:0%
that's not correct I think if you look
 
02:15:43.910 --> 02:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
on the top of page two in Roman numeral
 
02:15:46.189 --> 02:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
uh 507
 
02:15:48.390 --> 02:15:48.400 align:start position:0%
I2 uh
 
02:15:51.069 --> 02:15:51.079 align:start position:0%
1B uh it says that the third party
 
02:15:55.229 --> 02:15:55.239 align:start position:0%
provider of information uh can disclose
 
02:15:57.870 --> 02:15:57.880 align:start position:0%
information um if they have reason to
 
02:15:59.510 --> 02:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
believe that such disclosure is
 
02:16:01.709 --> 02:16:01.719 align:start position:0%
necessary to prevent detect protect
 
02:16:05.350 --> 02:16:05.360 align:start position:0%
against or respond to past present or
 
02:16:08.390 --> 02:16:08.400 align:start position:0%
expected criminal or fraudulent conduct
 
02:16:11.470 --> 02:16:11.480 align:start position:0%
identity theft harassment or deceptive
 
02:16:14.030 --> 02:16:14.040 align:start position:0%
or malicious activity so I think it is
 
02:16:16.750 --> 02:16:16.760 align:start position:0%
designed to say that that can happen
 
02:16:19.589 --> 02:16:19.599 align:start position:0%
you'll notice that the bill also has
 
02:16:21.510 --> 02:16:21.520 align:start position:0%
specific provisions
 
02:16:24.069 --> 02:16:24.079 align:start position:0%
dealing with the disclosure of personal
 
02:16:26.430 --> 02:16:26.440 align:start position:0%
information at the request of
 
02:16:28.950 --> 02:16:28.960 align:start position:0%
governmental entities and it again it'll
 
02:16:33.469 --> 02:16:33.479 align:start position:0%
allows that to be done um but it it
 
02:16:36.309 --> 02:16:36.319 align:start position:0%
contains requirements that have to be
 
02:16:38.309 --> 02:16:38.319 align:start position:0%
satisfied um in order for that to be
 
02:16:42.549 --> 02:16:42.559 align:start position:0%
done and I as I said this was um this
 
02:16:44.070 --> 02:16:44.080 align:start position:0%
was something that I think was pretty
 
02:16:46.910 --> 02:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
carefully car uh thought out by this
 
02:16:49.709 --> 02:16:49.719 align:start position:0%
committee last year was approved on a
 
02:16:52.589 --> 02:16:52.599 align:start position:0%
bipartisan basis and was approved by the
 
02:16:54.190 --> 02:16:54.200 align:start position:0%
house and I think you know I think it is
 
02:16:56.429 --> 02:16:56.439 align:start position:0%
a very reasonable bill and I hope uh
 
02:16:57.629 --> 02:16:57.639 align:start position:0%
you'll support it and I'm happy to
 
02:17:00.230 --> 02:17:00.240 align:start position:0%
answer any questions any
 
02:17:04.230 --> 02:17:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:09.509 --> 02:17:09.519 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:11.790 --> 02:17:11.800 align:start position:0%
Kirk just
 
02:17:17.709 --> 02:17:17.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:21.870 --> 02:17:21.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:34.669 --> 02:17:34.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:37.030 --> 02:17:37.040 align:start position:0%
Schultz good morning Mr chairman and
 
02:17:38.190 --> 02:17:38.200 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
02:17:41.070 --> 02:17:41.080 align:start position:0%
Kiren Schultz I'm an attorney based in
 
02:17:44.150 --> 02:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
Manchester uh with Nix and pey and I'm
 
02:17:46.950 --> 02:17:46.960 align:start position:0%
here on behalf of State Farm which is
 
02:17:48.790 --> 02:17:48.800 align:start position:0%
one of the leading writers of home and
 
02:17:52.429 --> 02:17:52.439 align:start position:0%
auto insurance here in New Hampshire um
 
02:17:56.589 --> 02:17:56.599 align:start position:0%
I'm here to note our concerns with with
 
02:17:59.870 --> 02:17:59.880 align:start position:0%
HB 195 as drafted um I didn't expect to
 
02:18:01.750 --> 02:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
go first I I just have some high level
 
02:18:04.070 --> 02:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
concerns that I'll brief I'll briefly uh
 
02:18:05.830 --> 02:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
tell you about and then I I expect there
 
02:18:08.589 --> 02:18:08.599 align:start position:0%
are others here who may voice uh similar
 
02:18:11.030 --> 02:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
concerns but we are primarily concerned
 
02:18:12.589 --> 02:18:12.599 align:start position:0%
with the bill because it adds an
 
02:18:15.270 --> 02:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
unworkable overlay to the already
 
02:18:18.750 --> 02:18:18.760 align:start position:0%
complex landscape of privacy compliance
 
02:18:21.070 --> 02:18:21.080 align:start position:0%
for insurance companies
 
02:18:26.190 --> 02:18:26.200 align:start position:0%
um SB 255 or now enacted as RSA 507
 
02:18:28.389 --> 02:18:28.399 align:start position:0%
which went into effect uh earlier this
 
02:18:31.469 --> 02:18:31.479 align:start position:0%
year includes the exemptions relevant to
 
02:18:35.309 --> 02:18:35.319 align:start position:0%
State Farm as an insurer um but this
 
02:18:38.509 --> 02:18:38.519 align:start position:0%
bill fails to incorporate those same
 
02:18:41.070 --> 02:18:41.080 align:start position:0%
exemptions um and the bill appears to
 
02:18:43.389 --> 02:18:43.399 align:start position:0%
cause some conflicts with the existing
 
02:18:46.790 --> 02:18:46.800 align:start position:0%
law and exemptions uh particularly with
 
02:18:50.790 --> 02:18:50.800 align:start position:0%
respect to what we might Define as um
 
02:18:52.870 --> 02:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
personal information or uh non-public
 
02:18:55.270 --> 02:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
personal information or personally
 
02:18:55.280 --> 02:18:56.709 align:start position:0%
personal information or personally
identifying

02:18:56.709 --> 02:18:56.719 align:start position:0%
identifying
 
02:18:59.469 --> 02:18:59.479 align:start position:0%
information um the bill is um it could
 
02:19:02.870 --> 02:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
be drafted better and more clearly um we
 
02:19:04.469 --> 02:19:04.479 align:start position:0%
think that obviously it fails to take
 
02:19:06.349 --> 02:19:06.359 align:start position:0%
into account those exemptions that are
 
02:19:09.070 --> 02:19:09.080 align:start position:0%
in uh RSA
 
02:19:12.870 --> 02:19:12.880 align:start position:0%
507 um we would be happy to work with uh
 
02:19:14.589 --> 02:19:14.599 align:start position:0%
the committee to to try to redraft some
 
02:19:17.750 --> 02:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
of the language if that's needed um and
 
02:19:19.429 --> 02:19:19.439 align:start position:0%
we would respectfully note that the the
 
02:19:21.230 --> 02:19:21.240 align:start position:0%
structure of this bill
 
02:19:23.750 --> 02:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
with the opt-in framework is uh
 
02:19:26.629 --> 02:19:26.639 align:start position:0%
different from what one tends to see in
 
02:19:28.790 --> 02:19:28.800 align:start position:0%
other run-of-the-mill privacy bills here
 
02:19:31.230 --> 02:19:31.240 align:start position:0%
and elsewhere um the opt-in consent
 
02:19:33.870 --> 02:19:33.880 align:start position:0%
mechanism for the disclosure of personal
 
02:19:37.230 --> 02:19:37.240 align:start position:0%
information is problematic for us for a
 
02:19:39.629 --> 02:19:39.639 align:start position:0%
number of reasons um we would certainly
 
02:19:42.270 --> 02:19:42.280 align:start position:0%
prefer to have an opt out mechanism
 
02:19:43.910 --> 02:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
because that would uh from our
 
02:19:46.469 --> 02:19:46.479 align:start position:0%
perspective lower compliance costs while
 
02:19:49.790 --> 02:19:49.800 align:start position:0%
still empowering individuals with
 
02:19:52.910 --> 02:19:52.920 align:start position:0%
decision- making a authority over how
 
02:19:56.670 --> 02:19:56.680 align:start position:0%
their data is utilized and uh as um
 
02:20:00.309 --> 02:20:00.319 align:start position:0%
chairman Lynn noted the uh RSA 507
 
02:20:04.110 --> 02:20:04.120 align:start position:0%
H4 does contain that opt out framework
 
02:20:07.030 --> 02:20:07.040 align:start position:0%
rather than opt in
 
02:20:09.910 --> 02:20:09.920 align:start position:0%
um it uh under the bill as drafted the
 
02:20:12.910 --> 02:20:12.920 align:start position:0%
process for seeking consent uh is
 
02:20:14.670 --> 02:20:14.680 align:start position:0%
separate has to be separate from any
 
02:20:16.230 --> 02:20:16.240 align:start position:0%
other communication sent to the
 
02:20:18.630 --> 02:20:18.640 align:start position:0%
individual by the third party provider
 
02:20:20.309 --> 02:20:20.319 align:start position:0%
of information and services and that
 
02:20:20.319 --> 02:20:21.590 align:start position:0%
of information and services and that
creat

02:20:21.590 --> 02:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
creat
 
02:20:23.950 --> 02:20:23.960 align:start position:0%
uh a pretty big additional step for
 
02:20:26.429 --> 02:20:26.439 align:start position:0%
State Farm anyway that would require
 
02:20:29.950 --> 02:20:29.960 align:start position:0%
development of new forms and notices to
 
02:20:32.030 --> 02:20:32.040 align:start position:0%
be implemented and that could also be
 
02:20:32.040 --> 02:20:33.070 align:start position:0%
be implemented and that could also be
very

02:20:33.070 --> 02:20:33.080 align:start position:0%
very
 
02:20:36.950 --> 02:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
costly um in section proposed section
 
02:20:39.110 --> 02:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
507 uh
 
02:20:41.990 --> 02:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
I3 comma Roman 3 uh disclosure of
 
02:20:43.349 --> 02:20:43.359 align:start position:0%
personal information to government
 
02:20:46.030 --> 02:20:46.040 align:start position:0%
entities that requires um that a
 
02:20:47.590 --> 02:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
provider must
 
02:20:49.630 --> 02:20:49.640 align:start position:0%
contemporaneously with such a disclosure
 
02:20:51.270 --> 02:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
to a governmental entity
 
02:20:53.750 --> 02:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
provide notice that it has made that
 
02:20:56.230 --> 02:20:56.240 align:start position:0%
disclosure to the individual to whom the
 
02:20:58.590 --> 02:20:58.600 align:start position:0%
information pertains and again
 
02:21:01.870 --> 02:21:01.880 align:start position:0%
contemporaneous disclosure is not very
 
02:21:03.990 --> 02:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
practicable for a number of reasons and
 
02:21:06.750 --> 02:21:06.760 align:start position:0%
we would propose considering uh possibly
 
02:21:09.230 --> 02:21:09.240 align:start position:0%
increasing that time period or defining
 
02:21:11.990 --> 02:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
the amount of allowable time to disclose
 
02:21:14.630 --> 02:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
to the individual for example 30 to 45
 
02:21:17.070 --> 02:21:17.080 align:start position:0%
business days um just as a
 
02:21:17.080 --> 02:21:18.670 align:start position:0%
business days um just as a
suggestion

02:21:18.670 --> 02:21:18.680 align:start position:0%
suggestion
 
02:21:21.630 --> 02:21:21.640 align:start position:0%
um the bill does also put limitations on
 
02:21:24.070 --> 02:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
sharing data obviously um you can't
 
02:21:25.790 --> 02:21:25.800 align:start position:0%
share data with service providers
 
02:21:28.670 --> 02:21:28.680 align:start position:0%
vendors Affiliates and uh the
 
02:21:31.469 --> 02:21:31.479 align:start position:0%
problematic part of that um from a
 
02:21:34.389 --> 02:21:34.399 align:start position:0%
practical perspective is that State Farm
 
02:21:36.790 --> 02:21:36.800 align:start position:0%
as an insurance company often discloses
 
02:21:39.349 --> 02:21:39.359 align:start position:0%
phone numbers to service providers um
 
02:21:41.670 --> 02:21:41.680 align:start position:0%
even to other insurers in the course of
 
02:21:44.030 --> 02:21:44.040 align:start position:0%
claim handling that goes on
 
02:21:47.389 --> 02:21:47.399 align:start position:0%
frequently um and lastly I would say
 
02:21:49.830 --> 02:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
just the enforcement mechanism that is
 
02:21:51.710 --> 02:21:51.720 align:start position:0%
included in the bill has drafted
 
02:21:53.429 --> 02:21:53.439 align:start position:0%
enforcements conducted by the AG's
 
02:21:55.469 --> 02:21:55.479 align:start position:0%
office meaning that for State Farm it
 
02:21:57.150 --> 02:21:57.160 align:start position:0%
would really add a whole another
 
02:22:00.670 --> 02:22:00.680 align:start position:0%
regulator another another agency um and
 
02:22:02.389 --> 02:22:02.399 align:start position:0%
it's also concerning that there is no
 
02:22:05.190 --> 02:22:05.200 align:start position:0%
opportunity to cure an alleged violation
 
02:22:08.590 --> 02:22:08.600 align:start position:0%
built into this bill before the ago uh
 
02:22:11.110 --> 02:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
commences an enforcement action so those
 
02:22:13.309 --> 02:22:13.319 align:start position:0%
are our high level thoughts on uh why we
 
02:22:14.950 --> 02:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
think the bill is problematic as drafted
 
02:22:17.349 --> 02:22:17.359 align:start position:0%
and we would oppose it happy to respond
 
02:22:19.630 --> 02:22:19.640 align:start position:0%
to questions if necessary are there any
 
02:22:19.640 --> 02:22:21.469 align:start position:0%
to questions if necessary are there any
questions

02:22:21.469 --> 02:22:21.479 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:22:24.550 --> 02:22:24.560 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you thank you very
 
02:22:26.670 --> 02:22:26.680 align:start position:0%
muches do you have any
 
02:22:28.750 --> 02:22:28.760 align:start position:0%
written do you have written testimony
 
02:22:30.429 --> 02:22:30.439 align:start position:0%
for the committee I I have my notes I'm
 
02:22:33.150 --> 02:22:33.160 align:start position:0%
happy to submit my notes later you like
 
02:22:36.550 --> 02:22:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:54.389 --> 02:22:54.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:55.910 --> 02:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chair and members of the
 
02:22:57.550 --> 02:22:57.560 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Lieutenant Steve
 
02:22:58.750 --> 02:22:58.760 align:start position:0%
mcau I'm with the New Hampshire State
 
02:23:00.110 --> 02:23:00.120 align:start position:0%
Police and representing the nire state
 
02:23:02.590 --> 02:23:02.600 align:start position:0%
police um on House Bill
 
02:23:05.990 --> 02:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
195 we are taking a neutral St stance
 
02:23:07.510 --> 02:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
and uh this is really just educational
 
02:23:08.950 --> 02:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
and just some of the two concerns that
 
02:23:12.030 --> 02:23:12.040 align:start position:0%
we see with the bill as is um the first
 
02:23:14.510 --> 02:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
one I wanted to address was on page
 
02:23:17.630 --> 02:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
three line one uh where it states that
 
02:23:19.269 --> 02:23:19.279 align:start position:0%
shall not require production of the
 
02:23:21.950 --> 02:23:21.960 align:start position:0%
information sooner than 10 days from the
 
02:23:24.790 --> 02:23:24.800 align:start position:0%
date the request or demand is made and
 
02:23:27.389 --> 02:23:27.399 align:start position:0%
then within 5 days uh receiving such a
 
02:23:29.550 --> 02:23:29.560 align:start position:0%
request or demand the provider shall
 
02:23:31.269 --> 02:23:31.279 align:start position:0%
notify the individual who the
 
02:23:34.150 --> 02:23:34.160 align:start position:0%
information pertains to uh the concern
 
02:23:36.190 --> 02:23:36.200 align:start position:0%
we see with this is while we're in the
 
02:23:39.110 --> 02:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
midst of investigating a crime
 
02:23:41.670 --> 02:23:41.680 align:start position:0%
and with myself I'm the lieutenant of
 
02:23:44.950 --> 02:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
the major crime unit and investigating
 
02:23:47.030 --> 02:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
these arious crimes we're often
 
02:23:49.429 --> 02:23:49.439 align:start position:0%
submitting subpoenas multiple subpoenas
 
02:23:50.990 --> 02:23:51.000 align:start position:0%
looking for different records
 
02:23:53.110 --> 02:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
uh this one addresses some about cell
 
02:23:55.710 --> 02:23:55.720 align:start position:0%
phones um and that sort of type of
 
02:23:57.630 --> 02:23:57.640 align:start position:0%
Records when we're issuing these
 
02:23:59.590 --> 02:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
subpoenas oftentimes we need this
 
02:24:01.550 --> 02:24:01.560 align:start position:0%
information back very quickly to be able
 
02:24:04.750 --> 02:24:04.760 align:start position:0%
to continue our investigation on uh to
 
02:24:06.710 --> 02:24:06.720 align:start position:0%
make it possibly make an arrest or
 
02:24:10.269 --> 02:24:10.279 align:start position:0%
increased um P PC to get an arrest
 
02:24:12.830 --> 02:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
warrant or to be able to locate a person
 
02:24:15.309 --> 02:24:15.319 align:start position:0%
who is wanted for a a crime oftentimes
 
02:24:18.190 --> 02:24:18.200 align:start position:0%
it's a very violent crime if the
 
02:24:20.550 --> 02:24:20.560 align:start position:0%
production is not uh does not have to be
 
02:24:22.870 --> 02:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
within 10 days that could delay us
 
02:24:25.070 --> 02:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
getting this information to be able to
 
02:24:28.070 --> 02:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
um enforce these crimes such as uh
 
02:24:29.830 --> 02:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
homicide or whatever crime it may be
 
02:24:33.550 --> 02:24:33.560 align:start position:0%
that this falls under uh as well as be
 
02:24:35.670 --> 02:24:35.680 align:start position:0%
able to gain more probable cause towards
 
02:24:37.710 --> 02:24:37.720 align:start position:0%
an an arrest warrant so this could cause
 
02:24:40.710 --> 02:24:40.720 align:start position:0%
us some sort of delay in getting this
 
02:24:43.389 --> 02:24:43.399 align:start position:0%
information um and then the notification
 
02:24:48.150 --> 02:24:48.160 align:start position:0%
down on line 15 or 14 it starts it talks
 
02:24:51.550 --> 02:24:51.560 align:start position:0%
about uh contemporar
 
02:24:55.510 --> 02:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
notifying the I guess the customer that
 
02:24:58.349 --> 02:24:58.359 align:start position:0%
this request has been made this causes a
 
02:25:00.550 --> 02:25:00.560 align:start position:0%
concern for us as well under these
 
02:25:05.870 --> 02:25:05.880 align:start position:0%
circumstances the 507 I3 IC primarily ID
 
02:25:08.750 --> 02:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
and I which would be uh more of an
 
02:25:12.309 --> 02:25:12.319 align:start position:0%
Exogen circumstance for us often times
 
02:25:14.750 --> 02:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
these uh requests to these providers
 
02:25:17.030 --> 02:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
under the exm circumstances are
 
02:25:18.950 --> 02:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
requested prior to the primary
 
02:25:20.870 --> 02:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
investigative team arriving to these
 
02:25:23.429 --> 02:25:23.439 align:start position:0%
locations it may be requested from say a
 
02:25:26.990 --> 02:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
911 operator like this outli or the
 
02:25:28.950 --> 02:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
local police department may have a phone
 
02:25:31.349 --> 02:25:31.359 align:start position:0%
number and they may request active pinks
 
02:25:34.230 --> 02:25:34.240 align:start position:0%
on someone that say um somebody just
 
02:25:36.389 --> 02:25:36.399 align:start position:0%
kidnapped two children and they're on
 
02:25:40.269 --> 02:25:40.279 align:start position:0%
the Run they may request these uh pings
 
02:25:42.670 --> 02:25:42.680 align:start position:0%
and this information through this and
 
02:25:44.389 --> 02:25:44.399 align:start position:0%
then this states that
 
02:25:46.550 --> 02:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
contemporaneously they need to notify
 
02:25:46.560 --> 02:25:47.550 align:start position:0%
contemporaneously they need to notify
the

02:25:47.550 --> 02:25:47.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:25:49.670 --> 02:25:49.680 align:start position:0%
provider as you can see this would cause
 
02:25:52.070 --> 02:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
an issue if we're trying to track
 
02:25:53.790 --> 02:25:53.800 align:start position:0%
somebody that has committed a violent
 
02:25:56.030 --> 02:25:56.040 align:start position:0%
crime or committed any crime that we're
 
02:25:59.030 --> 02:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
able to enforce this type of activity
 
02:26:02.070 --> 02:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
on but then they're notified that we're
 
02:26:04.269 --> 02:26:04.279 align:start position:0%
currently looking for them and they're
 
02:26:05.790 --> 02:26:05.800 align:start position:0%
notified that we're looking at their
 
02:26:08.469 --> 02:26:08.479 align:start position:0%
cell phone uh location such and attempt
 
02:26:11.269 --> 02:26:11.279 align:start position:0%
to locate them I I would imagine so this
 
02:26:14.870 --> 02:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
would give them opportunity to then uh
 
02:26:18.110 --> 02:26:18.120 align:start position:0%
further hide or shut up their phones or
 
02:26:20.349 --> 02:26:20.359 align:start position:0%
um make it much more difficult for for
 
02:26:22.790 --> 02:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
us to find them and then the possibility
 
02:26:25.230 --> 02:26:25.240 align:start position:0%
of them committing whatever their final
 
02:26:28.910 --> 02:26:28.920 align:start position:0%
plan was or act is um and maybe speed up
 
02:26:28.920 --> 02:26:29.630 align:start position:0%
plan was or act is um and maybe speed up
that

02:26:29.630 --> 02:26:29.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:26:32.590 --> 02:26:32.600 align:start position:0%
timeline those are our two concerns uh
 
02:26:38.870 --> 02:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:42.230 --> 02:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
reads representative
 
02:26:44.830 --> 02:26:44.840 align:start position:0%
Smith thank thank you uh for being here
 
02:26:46.870 --> 02:26:46.880 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm a little surpris I'm glad to see
 
02:26:50.429 --> 02:26:50.439 align:start position:0%
you always glad to have people come um
 
02:26:53.990 --> 02:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
but as I read the bill
 
02:26:57.550 --> 02:26:57.560 align:start position:0%
um your issues that you raised are very
 
02:27:01.349 --> 02:27:01.359 align:start position:0%
very important and you're exempt under
 
02:27:04.110 --> 02:27:04.120 align:start position:0%
this bill from any of the restrictions
 
02:27:08.030 --> 02:27:08.040 align:start position:0%
that you talked about I see it in um
 
02:27:10.309 --> 02:27:10.319 align:start position:0%
well let's see the first place I see it
 
02:27:10.319 --> 02:27:11.510 align:start position:0%
well let's see the first place I see it
is

02:27:11.510 --> 02:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:27:15.030 --> 02:27:15.040 align:start position:0%
um well if you just start on page to
 
02:27:18.070 --> 02:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
line 18 and you go on through all of
 
02:27:20.950 --> 02:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
that and then
 
02:27:24.990 --> 02:27:25.000 align:start position:0%
you also specifically on page three
 
02:27:31.429 --> 02:27:31.439 align:start position:0%
starting with line nine um all of that
 
02:27:36.150 --> 02:27:36.160 align:start position:0%
um would I think uh answer your quite
 
02:27:38.790 --> 02:27:38.800 align:start position:0%
legitimate concerns that your situation
 
02:27:40.590 --> 02:27:40.600 align:start position:0%
is unusual and
 
02:27:43.750 --> 02:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
requires um immediate response am I
 
02:27:45.469 --> 02:27:45.479 align:start position:0%
missing something
 
02:27:49.070 --> 02:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
here as we read it um and if I do go on
 
02:27:52.349 --> 02:27:52.359 align:start position:0%
to page three line nine like you state
 
02:27:54.550 --> 02:27:54.560 align:start position:0%
it says when a government entity seeks
 
02:27:56.469 --> 02:27:56.479 align:start position:0%
disclosure of personal information from
 
02:27:58.230 --> 02:27:58.240 align:start position:0%
a provider of information and services
 
02:28:04.830 --> 02:28:04.840 align:start position:0%
pursuant to RSA 507 I3 I uh 1C 1D or 1e
 
02:28:06.910 --> 02:28:06.920 align:start position:0%
the provider shall contemporar inly with
 
02:28:09.110 --> 02:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
such disclosure provide notice that it
 
02:28:11.830 --> 02:28:11.840 align:start position:0%
has made the disclosure so I guess maybe
 
02:28:13.590 --> 02:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
that's our confusion but I feel like
 
02:28:16.309 --> 02:28:16.319 align:start position:0%
that states that um even if we make it
 
02:28:18.110 --> 02:28:18.120 align:start position:0%
under the exent circumstance or under
 
02:28:22.230 --> 02:28:22.240 align:start position:0%
the circumstances in 1 D or 1e it's
 
02:28:23.910 --> 02:28:23.920 align:start position:0%
still going to notify or it's saying
 
02:28:26.190 --> 02:28:26.200 align:start position:0%
that still shall contempor
 
02:28:28.750 --> 02:28:28.760 align:start position:0%
notify uh the provider and then did you
 
02:28:31.429 --> 02:28:31.439 align:start position:0%
go on to read the rest I don't blame you
 
02:28:33.670 --> 02:28:33.680 align:start position:0%
if you don't this stuff gets very
 
02:28:37.150 --> 02:28:37.160 align:start position:0%
boring are you talking about um I well
 
02:28:43.429 --> 02:28:43.439 align:start position:0%
it it goes on and and it um so are so
 
02:28:47.389 --> 02:28:47.399 align:start position:0%
and you go I mean it seems to me that
 
02:28:49.150 --> 02:28:49.160 align:start position:0%
and I'm sorry it needs to be if it needs
 
02:28:51.349 --> 02:28:51.359 align:start position:0%
to be clarified then I'm certainly glad
 
02:28:54.190 --> 02:28:54.200 align:start position:0%
that you brought that to our attention
 
02:28:58.710 --> 02:28:58.720 align:start position:0%
um but I I think it um a careful reading
 
02:29:01.870 --> 02:29:01.880 align:start position:0%
would show that this acknowledges that
 
02:29:04.309 --> 02:29:04.319 align:start position:0%
there circumstances particularly those
 
02:29:07.269 --> 02:29:07.279 align:start position:0%
in which you would find yourself um
 
02:29:09.510 --> 02:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
where you have to be able to move
 
02:29:13.309 --> 02:29:13.319 align:start position:0%
quickly and this would permit that thank
 
02:29:16.349 --> 02:29:16.359 align:start position:0%
you representative Smith so I did not
 
02:29:19.469 --> 02:29:19.479 align:start position:0%
see an exemption uh for notification I
 
02:29:20.830 --> 02:29:20.840 align:start position:0%
what I do read is that the government
 
02:29:22.429 --> 02:29:22.439 align:start position:0%
entity seeking the information demands
 
02:29:24.349 --> 02:29:24.359 align:start position:0%
that such notice not be provided and
 
02:29:26.070 --> 02:29:26.080 align:start position:0%
furnishes the provider with basis of its
 
02:29:28.469 --> 02:29:28.479 align:start position:0%
authority to make such a de demand so it
 
02:29:30.590 --> 02:29:30.600 align:start position:0%
would make us we would have to make that
 
02:29:34.309 --> 02:29:34.319 align:start position:0%
demand and our worry is that if it is um
 
02:29:37.230 --> 02:29:37.240 align:start position:0%
the 911 operator or making that demand
 
02:29:39.790 --> 02:29:39.800 align:start position:0%
in a split second notice they may I
 
02:29:41.990 --> 02:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
guess not make the
 
02:29:45.150 --> 02:29:45.160 align:start position:0%
demand that this not that we not
 
02:29:48.670 --> 02:29:48.680 align:start position:0%
notify so I maybe we're confusing it but
 
02:29:50.150 --> 02:29:50.160 align:start position:0%
or I'm misunderstanding that but but
 
02:29:52.830 --> 02:29:52.840 align:start position:0%
that's how it reads I guess well to us
 
02:29:54.830 --> 02:29:54.840 align:start position:0%
if I could just just if I could respond
 
02:29:56.790 --> 02:29:56.800 align:start position:0%
if it's all right I I thank you for
 
02:29:58.590 --> 02:29:58.600 align:start position:0%
bringing our attention I think we'll
 
02:30:00.870 --> 02:30:00.880 align:start position:0%
take some time to to go over it
 
02:30:03.790 --> 02:30:03.800 align:start position:0%
carefully and one thing that you might
 
02:30:05.469 --> 02:30:05.479 align:start position:0%
have brought to our attention is the
 
02:30:07.590 --> 02:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
need to make sure that the 911 people
 
02:30:09.950 --> 02:30:09.960 align:start position:0%
have appropriate
 
02:30:13.230 --> 02:30:13.240 align:start position:0%
training in terms of how they react but
 
02:30:16.590 --> 02:30:16.600 align:start position:0%
whatever I mean we will not ignore your
 
02:30:19.790 --> 02:30:19.800 align:start position:0%
your suggestion I think I think we think
 
02:30:19.800 --> 02:30:21.230 align:start position:0%
your suggestion I think I think we think
that

02:30:21.230 --> 02:30:21.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:30:24.070 --> 02:30:24.080 align:start position:0%
that we're on the case let's put it that
 
02:30:25.750 --> 02:30:25.760 align:start position:0%
way and we don't have to take any more
 
02:30:27.710 --> 02:30:27.720 align:start position:0%
time now but so thank you very much for
 
02:30:29.830 --> 02:30:29.840 align:start position:0%

are committed to protecting our customer

strict Federal privacy laws including
 
02:31:52.110 --> 02:31:52.120 align:start position:0%

Authority Fair Credit Reporting Act uh

the bank secrecy act which helps prevent

fraud and identity theft as well as
 
02:32:15.349 --> 02:32:15.359 align:start position:0%
Federal uh cyber security standards uh

which mandate strong it security and
risk

02:32:18.830 --> 02:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
risk
 
02:32:20.910 --> 02:32:20.920 align:start position:0%
management along with that banks are
 
02:32:23.230 --> 02:32:23.240 align:start position:0%
routinely examined for compliance with
 
02:32:25.510 --> 02:32:25.520 align:start position:0%
these Federal standards and failure to
 
02:32:27.750 --> 02:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
here could result in fines up to
 
02:32:29.950 --> 02:32:29.960 align:start position:0%
$100,000 personal liability for
 
02:32:32.349 --> 02:32:32.359 align:start position:0%
executives and enforcement action by
 
02:32:35.309 --> 02:32:35.319 align:start position:0%
their regulator um as you heard uh the
 
02:32:38.830 --> 02:32:38.840 align:start position:0%
legislature just last year um recognized
 
02:32:40.389 --> 02:32:40.399 align:start position:0%
the importance of protecting consumer
 
02:32:43.429 --> 02:32:43.439 align:start position:0%
data with the passage of Senate Bill 255
 
02:32:45.830 --> 02:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
was signed into law last year and I
 
02:32:48.030 --> 02:32:48.040 align:start position:0%
believe went into effect January 1st of
 
02:32:50.510 --> 02:32:50.520 align:start position:0%
this year um
 
02:32:55.950 --> 02:32:55.960 align:start position:0%
Our concern with passage of 195 is this
 
02:32:59.510 --> 02:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
would disrupt the uniformity that SB 255
 
02:33:03.150 --> 02:33:03.160 align:start position:0%
set out to uh achieve uh as you may know
 
02:33:06.110 --> 02:33:06.120 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 255 was modeled after
 
02:33:08.230 --> 02:33:08.240 align:start position:0%
similar laws passed in several other
 
02:33:11.910 --> 02:33:11.920 align:start position:0%
states and uh which is vitally important
 
02:33:14.070 --> 02:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
um you know lacking any congressional
 
02:33:15.750 --> 02:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
action on this
 
02:33:19.110 --> 02:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
front um some of the concerns we have uh
 
02:33:23.230 --> 02:33:23.240 align:start position:0%
we feel that this could uh could impact
 
02:33:26.990 --> 02:33:27.000 align:start position:0%
fraud prevention um fraud is on the rise
 
02:33:29.190 --> 02:33:29.200 align:start position:0%
with with financial fraud is on the rise
 
02:33:32.510 --> 02:33:32.520 align:start position:0%
with our bank customers um we feel that
 
02:33:35.750 --> 02:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
it does limit the uh use of biometric
 
02:33:38.950 --> 02:33:38.960 align:start position:0%
data um that is a key tool in some cases
 
02:33:41.630 --> 02:33:41.640 align:start position:0%
when uh determining customer is who they
 
02:33:44.550 --> 02:33:44.560 align:start position:0%
say they are uh we also feel that uh
 
02:33:48.389 --> 02:33:48.399 align:start position:0%
this may uh uh delay uh fraud
 
02:33:50.990 --> 02:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
investigations created by creating new
 
02:33:53.790 --> 02:33:53.800 align:start position:0%
restrictions um and just to sum up the
 
02:33:57.230 --> 02:33:57.240 align:start position:0%
key risks that we see um there could be
 
02:33:58.870 --> 02:33:58.880 align:start position:0%
regulatory conflicts and compliance
 
02:34:00.790 --> 02:34:00.800 align:start position:0%
burdens we could see increased
 
02:34:03.469 --> 02:34:03.479 align:start position:0%
compliance costs uh there is potential
 
02:34:05.510 --> 02:34:05.520 align:start position:0%
there is legal and financial liability
 
02:34:07.990 --> 02:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
with penalties up to $1,000 per
 
02:34:10.309 --> 02:34:10.319 align:start position:0%
violation operational challenges with
 
02:34:12.230 --> 02:34:12.240 align:start position:0%

privacy legislation in fact we were here
 
02:35:14.389 --> 02:35:14.399 align:start position:0%
two years ago uh in support of uh s255
 
02:35:17.349 --> 02:35:17.359 align:start position:0%
which uh is now uh the law of the land
 
02:35:20.950 --> 02:35:20.960 align:start position:0%
uh as of January um so I I do think it
 
02:35:22.910 --> 02:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
uh makes sense for us to take a step
 
02:35:25.790 --> 02:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
back and and recognize uh what you all
 
02:35:29.870 --> 02:35:29.880 align:start position:0%
did uh last session uh and uh what is uh
 
02:35:33.110 --> 02:35:33.120 align:start position:0%
the state law as of uh in effect as of
 
02:35:35.910 --> 02:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
this January uh New Hampshire consumers
 
02:35:38.870 --> 02:35:38.880 align:start position:0%
have the right to access correct delete
 
02:35:40.790 --> 02:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
and Export their personal data that is
 
02:35:42.870 --> 02:35:42.880 align:start position:0%
held by companies that they interact
 
02:35:45.469 --> 02:35:45.479 align:start position:0%
with they can further opt out of the
 
02:35:47.790 --> 02:35:47.800 align:start position:0%
sale of that data uh or the processing
 
02:35:49.710 --> 02:35:49.720 align:start position:0%
of that data for purposes of targeting
 
02:35:52.349 --> 02:35:52.359 align:start position:0%
uh targeted advertising or digital
 
02:35:54.550 --> 02:35:54.560 align:start position:0%
profiling the companies that collect
 
02:35:56.269 --> 02:35:56.279 align:start position:0%
this data uh need to limit what they
 
02:35:58.070 --> 02:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
collect in the first place and disclose
 
02:36:00.469 --> 02:36:00.479 align:start position:0%
the uses and the types of parties that
 
02:36:02.230 --> 02:36:02.240 align:start position:0%
they share that information with they
 
02:36:04.429 --> 02:36:04.439 align:start position:0%
must maintain that data in a safe and
 
02:36:06.790 --> 02:36:06.800 align:start position:0%
secure Manner and they cannot process
 
02:36:09.110 --> 02:36:09.120 align:start position:0%
sensitive data without opt-in consumer
 
02:36:11.830 --> 02:36:11.840 align:start position:0%
consent this is what is in statute today
 
02:36:14.070 --> 02:36:14.080 align:start position:0%
uh here in New Hampshire and in nearly
 
02:36:16.389 --> 02:36:16.399 align:start position:0%
20 other states uh including our uh New
 
02:36:17.910 --> 02:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
England Neighbors in Connecticut and
 
02:36:20.150 --> 02:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
Rhode Island uh
 
02:36:24.389 --> 02:36:24.399 align:start position:0%
h195 uh would be a significant change to
 
02:36:26.030 --> 02:36:26.040 align:start position:0%
uh the companies that are currently
 
02:36:28.750 --> 02:36:28.760 align:start position:0%
complying with this law uh the bill uh
 
02:36:30.309 --> 02:36:30.319 align:start position:0%
for example does not delineate between
 
02:36:32.269 --> 02:36:32.279 align:start position:0%
controllers and processors or data which
 
02:36:33.870 --> 02:36:33.880 align:start position:0%
is a Hallmark of every other
 
02:36:35.910 --> 02:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
comprehensive data Privacy Law this
 
02:36:37.469 --> 02:36:37.479 align:start position:0%
establishes different responsibilities
 
02:36:39.070 --> 02:36:39.080 align:start position:0%
for entities that actually interact with
 
02:36:40.870 --> 02:36:40.880 align:start position:0%
customers versus those that operate in
 
02:36:43.710 --> 02:36:43.720 align:start position:0%
the background uh as service providers
 
02:36:45.150 --> 02:36:45.160 align:start position:0%
uh it further does not distinguish
 
02:36:47.429 --> 02:36:47.439 align:start position:0%
between sensitive data and the kind of
 
02:36:49.830 --> 02:36:49.840 align:start position:0%
basic units of information that get past
 
02:36:52.670 --> 02:36:52.680 align:start position:0%
as a matter of course uh in most
 
02:36:55.510 --> 02:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
internet transactions uh this uh the
 
02:36:59.429 --> 02:36:59.439 align:start position:0%
main concern here is uh consent fatigue
 
02:37:02.230 --> 02:37:02.240 align:start position:0%
folks get so many consent requests to
 
02:37:03.870 --> 02:37:03.880 align:start position:0%
opt in that they simply start clicking
 
02:37:07.030 --> 02:37:07.040 align:start position:0%
through them the importance of opt-in
 
02:37:09.790 --> 02:37:09.800 align:start position:0%
consent for sensitive data is that it
 
02:37:12.870 --> 02:37:12.880 align:start position:0%
gives you pause it you consider whether
 
02:37:15.990 --> 02:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
sharing this specific information is
 
02:37:18.630 --> 02:37:18.640 align:start position:0%
necessary or in your best interest when
 
02:37:20.710 --> 02:37:20.720 align:start position:0%
it comes up with virtually every
 
02:37:22.389 --> 02:37:22.399 align:start position:0%
interaction you have with a website it
 
02:37:24.349 --> 02:37:24.359 align:start position:0%
just becomes rote and that's what we
 
02:37:28.230 --> 02:37:28.240 align:start position:0%
worry about for example so my favorite
 
02:37:30.429 --> 02:37:30.439 align:start position:0%
uh Campground Moose State uh moose Brook
 
02:37:32.950 --> 02:37:32.960 align:start position:0%
State Park in gorm um I go to New
 
02:37:34.830 --> 02:37:34.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State parks.gov
 
02:37:39.150 --> 02:37:39.160 align:start position:0%
uh as is typical with any uh website the
 
02:37:42.349 --> 02:37:42.359 align:start position:0%
ISP discloses my uh IP address I get my
 
02:37:45.110 --> 02:37:45.120 align:start position:0%
first popup you consent to this uh then
 
02:37:47.429 --> 02:37:47.439 align:start position:0%
I click on the Moose Brook link that
 
02:37:49.550 --> 02:37:49.560 align:start position:0%
takes me to Reser america.com which is
 
02:37:51.710 --> 02:37:51.720 align:start position:0%
the third party that operates all of the
 
02:37:53.550 --> 02:37:53.560 align:start position:0%
reservations for all of New Hampshire
 
02:37:55.750 --> 02:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
state parks uh I get another popup
 
02:37:57.830 --> 02:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
because I'm going to another site um I'm
 
02:37:59.910 --> 02:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
going to hit several more roadblocks on
 
02:38:01.590 --> 02:38:01.600 align:start position:0%
my way to actually processing that
 
02:38:03.190 --> 02:38:03.200 align:start position:0%
transaction and getting the campsite
 
02:38:06.830 --> 02:38:06.840 align:start position:0%
that I want now there are comprehensive
 
02:38:09.670 --> 02:38:09.680 align:start position:0%
data privacy laws uh in Rhode Island and
 
02:38:11.670 --> 02:38:11.680 align:start position:0%
Connecticut and there are state parks in
 
02:38:13.630 --> 02:38:13.640 align:start position:0%
Rhode Island and Connecticut not
 
02:38:15.309 --> 02:38:15.319 align:start position:0%
necessarily as good but you know they
 
02:38:17.070 --> 02:38:17.080 align:start position:0%
exist um and I could complete that
 
02:38:19.990 --> 02:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
entire transaction uh seamlessly
 
02:38:22.510 --> 02:38:22.520 align:start position:0%
I could further tell Reserve
 
02:38:24.429 --> 02:38:24.439 align:start position:0%
american.com not to sell that
 
02:38:26.830 --> 02:38:26.840 align:start position:0%
information that I used to process that
 
02:38:29.510 --> 02:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh transaction and if for whatever
 
02:38:32.469 --> 02:38:32.479 align:start position:0%
reason uh that site wants to ask me
 
02:38:36.590 --> 02:38:36.600 align:start position:0%
about uh my racial information or needs
 
02:38:39.070 --> 02:38:39.080 align:start position:0%
my exact geolocation data to for
 
02:38:40.230 --> 02:38:40.240 align:start position:0%
whatever reason to process that
 
02:38:43.110 --> 02:38:43.120 align:start position:0%
transaction they have to ask me for that
 
02:38:45.230 --> 02:38:45.240 align:start position:0%
and that is the opt-in process for the
 
02:38:48.349 --> 02:38:48.359 align:start position:0%
sensitive data um that's the case in
 
02:38:49.429 --> 02:38:49.439 align:start position:0%
Rhode Island that's the case in
 
02:38:51.550 --> 02:38:51.560 align:start position:0%
Connecticut and that is the case in New
 
02:38:55.230 --> 02:38:55.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire today as it stands um so uh
 
02:38:57.750 --> 02:38:57.760 align:start position:0%
with that that's uh we uh ask that the
 
02:38:59.870 --> 02:38:59.880 align:start position:0%
committee find this uh in expedient to
 
02:39:02.910 --> 02:39:02.920 align:start position:0%
legislate and allow the relatively new
 
02:39:04.630 --> 02:39:04.640 align:start position:0%
uh comprehensive data Privacy Law here
 
02:39:06.070 --> 02:39:06.080 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire to play
 
02:39:09.349 --> 02:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
out representative Perez thank you
 
02:39:11.590 --> 02:39:11.600 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question so do you
 
02:39:14.469 --> 02:39:14.479 align:start position:0%
view view this as a
 
02:39:16.750 --> 02:39:16.760 align:start position:0%
solution looking for a
 
02:39:20.870 --> 02:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
problem I would say that uh the existing
 
02:39:24.790 --> 02:39:24.800 align:start position:0%
law s255 which you passed um was the
 
02:39:28.150 --> 02:39:28.160 align:start position:0%
solution to uh the problems that I
 
02:39:31.550 --> 02:39:31.560 align:start position:0%
believe uh this is intended to to
 
02:39:34.870 --> 02:39:34.880 align:start position:0%
address thank you any other
 
02:39:39.510 --> 02:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:48.070 --> 02:39:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:51.230 --> 02:39:51.240 align:start position:0%
Kirk good good morning Mr chairman and
 
02:39:52.710 --> 02:39:52.720 align:start position:0%
good morning to committee members for
 
02:39:55.110 --> 02:39:55.120 align:start position:0%
the record my name is Neil Kirk I live
 
02:39:57.990 --> 02:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
in wear and I'm representing myself
 
02:40:01.349 --> 02:40:01.359 align:start position:0%
today I'm here in support of House Bill
 
02:40:03.830 --> 02:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
195 uh this bill protects an
 
02:40:07.070 --> 02:40:07.080 align:start position:0%
individual's personal data name dat
 
02:40:09.070 --> 02:40:09.080 align:start position:0%
birth date social security number
 
02:40:11.870 --> 02:40:11.880 align:start position:0%
biometric identifiers Etc from
 
02:40:15.269 --> 02:40:15.279 align:start position:0%
government or business intrusion when
 
02:40:18.309 --> 02:40:18.319 align:start position:0%
the personal information is given by the
 
02:40:21.870 --> 02:40:21.880 align:start position:0%
individual to a provider of goods and
 
02:40:24.990 --> 02:40:25.000 align:start position:0%
services uh excuse me for services and
 
02:40:27.550 --> 02:40:27.560 align:start position:0%
information such as telephone companies
 
02:40:28.830 --> 02:40:28.840 align:start position:0%
when you sign up with a telephone
 
02:40:29.990 --> 02:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
company you give them all sorts of
 
02:40:32.550 --> 02:40:32.560 align:start position:0%
information they use it but the reason
 
02:40:33.870 --> 02:40:33.880 align:start position:0%
you're signing up is not to give them
 
02:40:35.469 --> 02:40:35.479 align:start position:0%
the information but to get the telephone
 
02:40:37.750 --> 02:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
service same thing with internet service
 
02:40:39.950 --> 02:40:39.960 align:start position:0%
providers streaming companies social
 
02:40:44.269 --> 02:40:44.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:46.389 --> 02:40:46.399 align:start position:0%
Etc the reason why this bill is
 
02:40:48.590 --> 02:40:48.600 align:start position:0%
necessary is that the legal situation is
 
02:40:51.429 --> 02:40:51.439 align:start position:0%
unclear today as far as the United
 
02:40:53.830 --> 02:40:53.840 align:start position:0%
States is concerned U Supreme Court
 
02:40:55.630 --> 02:40:55.640 align:start position:0%
decisions involving the Fourth Amendment
 
02:40:58.710 --> 02:40:58.720 align:start position:0%
search and seizure proh prohibitions
 
02:41:00.790 --> 02:41:00.800 align:start position:0%
under those decisions there is no
 
02:41:03.030 --> 02:41:03.040 align:start position:0%
expectation of privacy and personal
 
02:41:04.830 --> 02:41:04.840 align:start position:0%
information given to the providers of
 
02:41:04.840 --> 02:41:06.070 align:start position:0%
information given to the providers of
these

02:41:06.070 --> 02:41:06.080 align:start position:0%
these
 
02:41:09.389 --> 02:41:09.399 align:start position:0%
Services um that means that today a
 
02:41:11.309 --> 02:41:11.319 align:start position:0%
provider of information and services can
 
02:41:12.590 --> 02:41:12.600 align:start position:0%
do whatever it wants with the
 
02:41:14.590 --> 02:41:14.600 align:start position:0%
information the personal information
 
02:41:16.630 --> 02:41:16.640 align:start position:0%
that you've given
 
02:41:20.190 --> 02:41:20.200 align:start position:0%
it with or without a subpoena unless a
 
02:41:21.950 --> 02:41:21.960 align:start position:0%
law dictates otherwise now there is one
 
02:41:24.150 --> 02:41:24.160 align:start position:0%
federal law for example for banks the
 
02:41:26.670 --> 02:41:26.680 align:start position:0%
right to privacy act in 2000 which deals
 
02:41:28.790 --> 02:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
to some extent with this in New
 
02:41:31.710 --> 02:41:31.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the situation is a little
 
02:41:33.309 --> 02:41:33.319 align:start position:0%
different but there is no statutory
 
02:41:34.830 --> 02:41:34.840 align:start position:0%
guidance in New Hampshire our Supreme
 
02:41:37.790 --> 02:41:37.800 align:start position:0%
Court perhaps even under the guidance of
 
02:41:40.990 --> 02:41:41.000 align:start position:0%
one former Supreme Court Justice um I
 
02:41:42.910 --> 02:41:42.920 align:start position:0%
don't know if he was there in 2003 or
 
02:41:45.590 --> 02:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
not but in 2003 in the case of State
 
02:41:49.309 --> 02:41:49.319 align:start position:0%
versus Goss an expectation of privacy
 
02:41:52.389 --> 02:41:52.399 align:start position:0%
was created in garbage this is New
 
02:41:53.510 --> 02:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in
 
02:41:56.349 --> 02:41:56.359 align:start position:0%
garbage in which was placed in black
 
02:41:59.190 --> 02:41:59.200 align:start position:0%
plastic bags left within 3 ft of the
 
02:42:01.190 --> 02:42:01.200 align:start position:0%
street for collection so police couldn't
 
02:42:04.750 --> 02:42:04.760 align:start position:0%
open the bag and use anything in it
 
02:42:07.429 --> 02:42:07.439 align:start position:0%
without getting a
 
02:42:10.710 --> 02:42:10.720 align:start position:0%
warrant in 2005 in the state versus
 
02:42:13.190 --> 02:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
gubitosi a subpoena to Verizon for
 
02:42:13.200 --> 02:42:14.230 align:start position:0%
gubitosi a subpoena to Verizon for
telephone

02:42:14.230 --> 02:42:14.240 align:start position:0%
telephone
 
02:42:17.070 --> 02:42:17.080 align:start position:0%
numbers um called from the cell the
 
02:42:19.510 --> 02:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
defendant's telephone was valid as the
 
02:42:22.590 --> 02:42:22.600 align:start position:0%
defendant had no expectation of privacy
 
02:42:24.990 --> 02:42:25.000 align:start position:0%
in the telephone numbers he called as
 
02:42:27.269 --> 02:42:27.279 align:start position:0%
distinct from the content of the call
 
02:42:29.870 --> 02:42:29.880 align:start position:0%
that was a split decision the majority
 
02:42:31.790 --> 02:42:31.800 align:start position:0%
said nothing in today's decision
 
02:42:33.670 --> 02:42:33.680 align:start position:0%
prevents the legislature from closely
 
02:42:36.510 --> 02:42:36.520 align:start position:0%
regulating subpoenas for phone
 
02:42:39.670 --> 02:42:39.680 align:start position:0%
records and the
 
02:42:42.630 --> 02:42:42.640 align:start position:0%
concurrence said among other things I
 
02:42:44.269 --> 02:42:44.279 align:start position:0%
would encourage the legislature to
 
02:42:45.830 --> 02:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
examine whether telephone billing
 
02:42:47.349 --> 02:42:47.359 align:start position:0%
records should be protected from the
 
02:42:51.190 --> 02:42:51.200 align:start position:0%
reach of a process uors
 
02:42:53.510 --> 02:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
subpoena the New Hampshire Supreme Court
 
02:42:55.469 --> 02:42:55.479 align:start position:0%
has not yet considered the implications
 
02:42:58.190 --> 02:42:58.200 align:start position:0%
of the recent um privacy uh
 
02:43:00.510 --> 02:43:00.520 align:start position:0%
informational Constitutional Amendment
 
02:43:03.190 --> 02:43:03.200 align:start position:0%
which says an individual's right to live
 
02:43:04.990 --> 02:43:05.000 align:start position:0%
free from government intrusion in
 
02:43:07.469 --> 02:43:07.479 align:start position:0%
private or personal information is
 
02:43:10.910 --> 02:43:10.920 align:start position:0%
natural essential and
 
02:43:14.070 --> 02:43:14.080 align:start position:0%
inherent now what does this bill do it
 
02:43:16.349 --> 02:43:16.359 align:start position:0%
clarifies the Constitutional Amendment
 
02:43:18.990 --> 02:43:19.000 align:start position:0%
with a legislative determination that
 
02:43:22.230 --> 02:43:22.240 align:start position:0%
the the thirdparty doctrine which allows
 
02:43:25.469 --> 02:43:25.479 align:start position:0%
access by anyone including the companies
 
02:43:26.870 --> 02:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
to the information that you've given
 
02:43:28.990 --> 02:43:29.000 align:start position:0%
them for that service third party
 
02:43:30.910 --> 02:43:30.920 align:start position:0%
Doctrine says that information is not
 
02:43:34.670 --> 02:43:34.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:36.790 --> 02:43:36.800 align:start position:0%
protections that this thirdparty
 
02:43:39.030 --> 02:43:39.040 align:start position:0%
Doctrine does not operate as an escape
 
02:43:41.150 --> 02:43:41.160 align:start position:0%
PCH for providers of information and

02:44:00.230 --> 02:44:00.240 align:start position:0%
you know if you do our service you've
 
02:44:02.790 --> 02:44:02.800 align:start position:0%
agreed to our terms which we all do but
 
02:44:04.750 --> 02:44:04.760 align:start position:0%
have no clue what we're agreeing to now
 
02:44:07.510 --> 02:44:07.520 align:start position:0%

02:44:08.950 --> 02:44:08.960 align:start position:0%

required for them to fulfill the
 
02:44:21.389 --> 02:44:21.399 align:start position:0%
statutory responsibilities provided the

02:44:27.590 --> 02:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity to contest the request
 
02:44:29.990 --> 02:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
there's an exception for information uh
 
02:44:31.990 --> 02:44:32.000 align:start position:0%

02:44:33.830 --> 02:44:33.840 align:start position:0%

Statute somewhere else in the RSA
 
02:44:52.750 --> 02:44:52.760 align:start position:0%
is and there's an exception for grand

jury testimony or sorry grand jury uh
 
02:44:58.870 --> 02:44:58.880 align:start position:0%
information subpoenas enforcement in
 
02:45:02.110 --> 02:45:02.120 align:start position:0%
this case is by the AG only a private
 
02:45:06.550 --> 02:45:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:10.030 --> 02:45:10.040 align:start position:0%
excluded I can think of no more
 
02:45:12.590 --> 02:45:12.600 align:start position:0%
appropriate legislative determination as
 
02:45:14.670 --> 02:45:14.680 align:start position:0%
to what the Privacy constitutional
 
02:45:17.429 --> 02:45:17.439 align:start position:0%
privacy Amendment means than House Bill
 
02:45:20.349 --> 02:45:20.359 align:start position:0%
195 it's right on
 
02:45:25.269 --> 02:45:25.279 align:start position:0%
point I would add only that um there is
 
02:45:27.710 --> 02:45:27.720 align:start position:0%
a an amendment that I think improves the
 
02:45:31.070 --> 02:45:31.080 align:start position:0%
bill one of the things that I think is
 
02:45:33.830 --> 02:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
the case is that some of these service
 
02:45:36.030 --> 02:45:36.040 align:start position:0%
providers uh in order to provide the
 
02:45:37.550 --> 02:45:37.560 align:start position:0%
service the telephone service or the
 
02:45:37.560 --> 02:45:38.550 align:start position:0%
service the telephone service or the
streaming

02:45:38.550 --> 02:45:38.560 align:start position:0%
streaming
 
02:45:41.349 --> 02:45:41.359 align:start position:0%
service use other people other
 
02:45:43.190 --> 02:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
organizations to do some of the work for
 
02:45:44.750 --> 02:45:44.760 align:start position:0%
example they may store information in
 
02:45:47.630 --> 02:45:47.640 align:start position:0%
the cloud and to the extent they do that
 
02:45:49.030 --> 02:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
they have to give this personal
 
02:45:51.870 --> 02:45:51.880 align:start position:0%
information to the cloud provider so I'd
 
02:45:54.469 --> 02:45:54.479 align:start position:0%
like to see an amendment to the bill
 
02:45:58.950 --> 02:45:58.960 align:start position:0%
which would go in section um what is it
 
02:46:04.950 --> 02:46:04.960 align:start position:0%
507 i2i or Roman I if this would be e
 
02:46:06.590 --> 02:46:06.600 align:start position:0%
this would be an exception the personal
 
02:46:09.150 --> 02:46:09.160 align:start position:0%
information is disclosed by the third
 
02:46:11.990 --> 02:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
party provider in order to provide the
 
02:46:14.990 --> 02:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
service which the individual has
 
02:46:17.550 --> 02:46:17.560 align:start position:0%
requested so these companies can provide
 
02:46:19.349 --> 02:46:19.359 align:start position:0%
this information if the purpose of
 
02:46:20.670 --> 02:46:20.680 align:start position:0%
providing the information is to make
 
02:46:22.590 --> 02:46:22.600 align:start position:0%
sure I get telephone
 
02:46:26.150 --> 02:46:26.160 align:start position:0%
service I think that would um eliminate
 
02:46:27.750 --> 02:46:27.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of some problems that some of
 
02:46:30.309 --> 02:46:30.319 align:start position:0%
these uh providers have with the bill
 
02:46:33.389 --> 02:46:33.399 align:start position:0%
and certainly would not in any way um
 
02:46:35.590 --> 02:46:35.600 align:start position:0%
give access to this personal information
 
02:46:37.550 --> 02:46:37.560 align:start position:0%
where it would be
 
02:46:39.910 --> 02:46:39.920 align:start position:0%
inappropriate I hope the committee uh
 
02:46:42.110 --> 02:46:42.120 align:start position:0%
will look favorably on this bill and I'm
 
02:46:43.870 --> 02:46:43.880 align:start position:0%
pleased Mr chairman to answer any
 
02:46:46.070 --> 02:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
questions if there are any
 
02:46:46.080 --> 02:46:47.110 align:start position:0%
questions if there are any
representative

02:46:47.110 --> 02:46:47.120 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:46:50.710 --> 02:46:50.720 align:start position:0%
Smith um thank thank you very much good
 
02:46:54.830 --> 02:46:54.840 align:start position:0%
um good morning um Mr chair lots of
 
02:46:56.910 --> 02:46:56.920 align:start position:0%
chairs in this room it's important to
 
02:47:00.030 --> 02:47:00.040 align:start position:0%
recognize that um I do want to begin by
 
02:47:02.510 --> 02:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
saying we sent out a search party when
 
02:47:05.070 --> 02:47:05.080 align:start position:0%
we began this bill because we wanted you
 
02:47:08.070 --> 02:47:08.080 align:start position:0%
to be here for all of it you miss the
 
02:47:10.389 --> 02:47:10.399 align:start position:0%
presentation of the bill you missed the
 
02:47:12.870 --> 02:47:12.880 align:start position:0%
comments by a representative of the
 
02:47:14.990 --> 02:47:15.000 align:start position:0%
insurance industry you missed the
 
02:47:17.750 --> 02:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
comments by a representative of the
 
02:47:21.710 --> 02:47:21.720 align:start position:0%
banking uh um industry that indicated by
 
02:47:25.030 --> 02:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
the way not one but four different I
 
02:47:28.150 --> 02:47:28.160 align:start position:0%
believe Federal uh laws that uh they
 
02:47:31.630 --> 02:47:31.640 align:start position:0%
were required to file you missed a very
 
02:47:34.510 --> 02:47:34.520 align:start position:0%
interesting presentation by the state
 
02:47:40.590 --> 02:47:40.600 align:start position:0%
police who um who felt that
 
02:47:44.950 --> 02:47:44.960 align:start position:0%
um their need to move rapidly wasn't
 
02:47:49.590 --> 02:47:49.600 align:start position:0%
clear enough in the bill um uh
 
02:47:51.550 --> 02:47:51.560 align:start position:0%
and we we show the sections but they
 
02:47:54.349 --> 02:47:54.359 align:start position:0%
didn't quite agree that and and and
 
02:47:58.710 --> 02:47:58.720 align:start position:0%
somebody who represents um uh uh some
 
02:48:01.110 --> 02:48:01.120 align:start position:0%
technical group I couldn't quite get all
 
02:48:04.469 --> 02:48:04.479 align:start position:0%
the the code names and but all of those
 
02:48:08.990 --> 02:48:09.000 align:start position:0%
were opposed to this bill saying that it
 
02:48:10.910 --> 02:48:10.920 align:start position:0%
did not meet their needs it wasn't
 
02:48:15.590 --> 02:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
workable it in interfered with their
 
02:48:17.710 --> 02:48:17.720 align:start position:0%
ability to carry out their
 
02:48:20.830 --> 02:48:20.840 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and unfortunately Mr
 
02:48:22.790 --> 02:48:22.800 align:start position:0%
chairman you weren't here to
 
02:48:27.190 --> 02:48:27.200 align:start position:0%
respond um based on what you and the
 
02:48:29.750 --> 02:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
other thing is that there has been some
 
02:48:32.469 --> 02:48:32.479 align:start position:0%
legislation that has passed in the state
 
02:48:34.469 --> 02:48:34.479 align:start position:0%
since we began this
 
02:48:38.790 --> 02:48:38.800 align:start position:0%
process um so looking at this bill
 
02:48:41.469 --> 02:48:41.479 align:start position:0%
you've now mentioned one area that you
 
02:48:43.670 --> 02:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
think could
 
02:48:43.680 --> 02:48:45.550 align:start position:0%
think could
help

02:48:45.550 --> 02:48:45.560 align:start position:0%
help
 
02:48:48.150 --> 02:48:48.160 align:start position:0%
um improve the bill and we're always
 
02:48:48.160 --> 02:48:49.670 align:start position:0%
um improve the bill and we're always
happy

02:48:49.670 --> 02:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
happy
 
02:48:52.830 --> 02:48:52.840 align:start position:0%
to get that um do
 
02:48:55.870 --> 02:48:55.880 align:start position:0%
you however see that the language of
 
02:48:58.710 --> 02:48:58.720 align:start position:0%
this bill makes interferes with the
 
02:49:00.910 --> 02:49:00.920 align:start position:0%
ability of those institutions that I
 
02:49:04.990 --> 02:49:05.000 align:start position:0%
refer to um banking Insurance whatever
 
02:49:08.030 --> 02:49:08.040 align:start position:0%
to carry out their responsibilities in
 
02:49:11.429 --> 02:49:11.439 align:start position:0%
any way that would be appropriate while
 
02:49:14.469 --> 02:49:14.479 align:start position:0%
recognizing the rights to
 
02:49:17.110 --> 02:49:17.120 align:start position:0%
privacy it's a it's a simple question
 
02:49:17.120 --> 02:49:19.309 align:start position:0%
privacy it's a it's a simple question

private information for their own
 
02:49:50.830 --> 02:49:50.840 align:start position:0%
purposes come out in droves and explain
 
02:49:53.670 --> 02:49:53.680 align:start position:0%
why the world as they know it um will no
 
02:49:53.680 --> 02:49:56.070 align:start position:0%
why the world as they know it um will no
longer

02:49:56.070 --> 02:49:56.080 align:start position:0%
longer
 
02:49:58.910 --> 02:49:58.920 align:start position:0%
exist to some extent this will impinge
 
02:50:01.550 --> 02:50:01.560 align:start position:0%
upon their ability to make money or do
 
02:50:05.110 --> 02:50:05.120 align:start position:0%
their jobs but the question for you as
 
02:50:07.309 --> 02:50:07.319 align:start position:0%
policy makers is to balance the
 
02:50:09.950 --> 02:50:09.960 align:start position:0%
interests of privacy for the individual
 
02:50:11.150 --> 02:50:11.160 align:start position:0%
against the interests of these
 
02:50:13.150 --> 02:50:13.160 align:start position:0%
organizations both to do their jobs
 
02:50:15.389 --> 02:50:15.399 align:start position:0%
including making money it's a tough
 
02:50:17.389 --> 02:50:17.399 align:start position:0%
decision but that's what you're paid the
 
02:50:19.710 --> 02:50:19.720 align:start position:0%
big bucks for
 
02:50:22.429 --> 02:50:22.439 align:start position:0%
um when I did come in I heard what I
 
02:50:24.670 --> 02:50:24.680 align:start position:0%
thought was a speaker a a person who was
 
02:50:27.590 --> 02:50:27.600 align:start position:0%
testifying talk about a Senate Bill
 
02:50:30.950 --> 02:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
255 Senate Bill 255 has gotten a lot of
 
02:50:34.550 --> 02:50:34.560 align:start position:0%
hype but it's basically a useless
 
02:50:37.389 --> 02:50:37.399 align:start position:0%
bill um in order for you to exercise any
 
02:50:40.269 --> 02:50:40.279 align:start position:0%
of the rights that you have to uh that
 
02:50:42.710 --> 02:50:42.720 align:start position:0%
you have under that bill you have to
 
02:50:45.110 --> 02:50:45.120 align:start position:0%
engage in what amounts to a full-time
 
02:50:47.269 --> 02:50:47.279 align:start position:0%
effort to contact every company you've
 
02:50:49.710 --> 02:50:49.720 align:start position:0%
ever done business with
 
02:50:52.790 --> 02:50:52.800 align:start position:0%
um run through their unique individual
 
02:50:55.790 --> 02:50:55.800 align:start position:0%
way of exercising your rights because
 
02:50:57.389 --> 02:50:57.399 align:start position:0%
each of the controllers and that bill
 
02:51:00.269 --> 02:51:00.279 align:start position:0%
can set up their own systems um it's
 
02:51:03.910 --> 02:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
about as useless as well excuse me it's
 
02:51:08.590 --> 02:51:08.600 align:start position:0%
about as useful as um some of the uh
 
02:51:10.630 --> 02:51:10.640 align:start position:0%
bills that we or some of the procedures
 
02:51:12.150 --> 02:51:12.160 align:start position:0%
that we now have for exercising our
 
02:51:14.550 --> 02:51:14.560 align:start position:0%
rights which I mentioned before when you
 
02:51:16.630 --> 02:51:16.640 align:start position:0%
go online um and you want to use a
 
02:51:18.110 --> 02:51:18.120 align:start position:0%
particular site they say you have to
 
02:51:19.830 --> 02:51:19.840 align:start position:0%
agree to all of our terms of services
 
02:51:21.550 --> 02:51:21.560 align:start position:0%
and we agree because we don't have the
 
02:51:24.309 --> 02:51:24.319 align:start position:0%
time and frankly some of us including me
 
02:51:26.790 --> 02:51:26.800 align:start position:0%
don't have the ability to understand
 
02:51:29.349 --> 02:51:29.359 align:start position:0%
everything they're asking us to
 
02:51:33.870 --> 02:51:33.880 align:start position:0%
do 255 is not helpful on privacy grounds
 
02:51:35.790 --> 02:51:35.800 align:start position:0%
it's a great thing for Microsoft and the
 
02:51:37.710 --> 02:51:37.720 align:start position:0%
others who were pushing it because they
 
02:51:39.110 --> 02:51:39.120 align:start position:0%
were able to get something through the
 
02:51:40.469 --> 02:51:40.479 align:start position:0%
states that they couldn't get through
 
02:51:42.229 --> 02:51:42.239 align:start position:0%
Congress and they can now tell their
 
02:51:45.309 --> 02:51:45.319 align:start position:0%
people we really care about privacy but
 
02:51:47.550 --> 02:51:47.560 align:start position:0%
it doesn't work as a practical matter
 
02:51:49.550 --> 02:51:49.560 align:start position:0%
this bill works as a practical
 
02:51:51.469 --> 02:51:51.479 align:start position:0%
matter and it's also in the New
 
02:51:51.479 --> 02:51:52.670 align:start position:0%
matter and it's also in the New
Hampshire

02:51:52.670 --> 02:51:52.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
02:51:56.670 --> 02:51:56.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:59.469 --> 02:51:59.479 align:start position:0%
significant problems that some of these
 
02:52:01.990 --> 02:52:02.000 align:start position:0%
folks have with this
 
02:52:04.269 --> 02:52:04.279 align:start position:0%
bill I hope the chairman will set up a
 
02:52:05.870 --> 02:52:05.880 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and try to work some of
 
02:52:05.880 --> 02:52:07.429 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and try to work some of
them

02:52:07.429 --> 02:52:07.439 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:52:10.070 --> 02:52:10.080 align:start position:0%
out if there are legitimate problems
 
02:52:12.349 --> 02:52:12.359 align:start position:0%
let's resolve them but the basic thrust
 
02:52:15.349 --> 02:52:15.359 align:start position:0%
of the bill is really
 
02:52:17.630 --> 02:52:17.640 align:start position:0%
important when I set up a telephone
 
02:52:19.469 --> 02:52:19.479 align:start position:0%
account when I set up a streaming
 
02:52:21.469 --> 02:52:21.479 align:start position:0%
account when I use any service and give
 
02:52:24.790 --> 02:52:24.800 align:start position:0%
my information I find it hard to believe
 
02:52:26.590 --> 02:52:26.600 align:start position:0%
that it's essential for them to sell
 
02:52:28.229 --> 02:52:28.239 align:start position:0%
that information for a profit in order
 
02:52:29.910 --> 02:52:29.920 align:start position:0%
for them to continue to provide me with
 
02:52:32.309 --> 02:52:32.319 align:start position:0%
the service I know Verizon doesn't need
 
02:52:33.750 --> 02:52:33.760 align:start position:0%
to do that and I don't know if Verizon
 
02:52:35.910 --> 02:52:35.920 align:start position:0%
sells us information or
 
02:52:38.389 --> 02:52:38.399 align:start position:0%
not remember this bill is not only
 
02:52:40.750 --> 02:52:40.760 align:start position:0%
directed at for-profit companies it's
 
02:52:42.510 --> 02:52:42.520 align:start position:0%
also directed at state
 
02:52:44.469 --> 02:52:44.479 align:start position:0%
government which is why the police were
 
02:52:44.479 --> 02:52:45.870 align:start position:0%
government which is why the police were
in

02:52:45.870 --> 02:52:45.880 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:52:48.950 --> 02:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
here um so
 
02:52:50.630 --> 02:52:50.640 align:start position:0%
I I haven't answered your question as
 
02:52:52.830 --> 02:52:52.840 align:start position:0%
specifically I was as I would like to
 
02:52:54.469 --> 02:52:54.479 align:start position:0%
representative Smith because I wasn't
 
02:52:56.750 --> 02:52:56.760 align:start position:0%
here and I apologize again to hear the
 
02:52:58.990 --> 02:52:59.000 align:start position:0%
specifics of the issue but that's one of
 
02:53:00.590 --> 02:53:00.600 align:start position:0%
the reasons why we have subcommittees to
 
02:53:03.030 --> 02:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
work on this
 
02:53:07.630 --> 02:53:07.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:11.670 --> 02:53:11.680 align:start position:0%
y Mr chair I have to say are you um
 
02:53:16.190 --> 02:53:16.200 align:start position:0%
aware of the procedures followed um by
 
02:53:19.070 --> 02:53:19.080 align:start position:0%
the shangan country the the European
 
02:53:23.269 --> 02:53:23.279 align:start position:0%
economic Community where you have um a
 
02:53:26.950 --> 02:53:26.960 align:start position:0%
very clear choice to accept all the
 
02:53:29.030 --> 02:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
conditions accept some of the conditions
 
02:53:31.190 --> 02:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
or refuse to accept the conditions but
 
02:53:34.309 --> 02:53:34.319 align:start position:0%
still have access to the site I'm aware
 
02:53:36.429 --> 02:53:36.439 align:start position:0%
of some of those because I've read about
 
02:53:38.070 --> 02:53:38.080 align:start position:0%
some of them but it's very complicated
 
02:53:40.110 --> 02:53:40.120 align:start position:0%
for me and I'm not totally familiar with
 
02:53:43.150 --> 02:53:43.160 align:start position:0%
them however when I do go on websites
 
02:53:46.590 --> 02:53:46.600 align:start position:0%
that are in Europe I am always asked
 
02:53:48.429 --> 02:53:48.439 align:start position:0%
what is it that I wish to do and it's
 
02:53:48.439 --> 02:53:49.190 align:start position:0%
what is it that I wish to do and it's
really

02:53:49.190 --> 02:53:49.200 align:start position:0%
really
 
02:53:52.830 --> 02:53:52.840 align:start position:0%
simple reject all accept all and you can
 
02:53:54.910 --> 02:53:54.920 align:start position:0%
continue using the site
 
02:53:57.710 --> 02:53:57.720 align:start position:0%
regardless uh that would be a delightful
 
02:53:59.830 --> 02:53:59.840 align:start position:0%
way if we could deal with privacy issues
 
02:54:01.870 --> 02:54:01.880 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire in that simple manner
 
02:54:05.910 --> 02:54:05.920 align:start position:0%
this bill is an effort to do that by in
 
02:54:08.349 --> 02:54:08.359 align:start position:0%
effect changing the rules that exist
 
02:54:09.910 --> 02:54:09.920 align:start position:0%
today which say once you give that
 
02:54:12.469 --> 02:54:12.479 align:start position:0%
information up it's theirs to use as
 
02:54:12.479 --> 02:54:13.349 align:start position:0%
information up it's theirs to use as
they

02:54:13.349 --> 02:54:13.359 align:start position:0%
they
 
02:54:16.670 --> 02:54:16.680 align:start position:0%
wish by saying no they have to ask your
 
02:54:18.870 --> 02:54:18.880 align:start position:0%
permission that's what this bill says if
 
02:54:20.910 --> 02:54:20.920 align:start position:0%
they want to get that information and
 
02:54:22.910 --> 02:54:22.920 align:start position:0%
use it they must get your
 
02:54:25.389 --> 02:54:25.399 align:start position:0%
consent it's not as good as what the
 
02:54:27.070 --> 02:54:27.080 align:start position:0%
Europeans are doing but it's a step in
 
02:54:27.080 --> 02:54:29.070 align:start position:0%
Europeans are doing but it's a step in
that

02:54:29.070 --> 02:54:29.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:54:30.990 --> 02:54:31.000 align:start position:0%
direction any
 
02:54:36.190 --> 02:54:36.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:46.910 --> 02:54:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:50.630 --> 02:54:50.640 align:start position:0%
Kingman just one second yep Mr Kirk do
 
02:54:51.790 --> 02:54:51.800 align:start position:0%
you have any written testimony that you
 
02:54:52.790 --> 02:54:52.800 align:start position:0%
could turn
 
02:54:52.800 --> 02:54:54.710 align:start position:0%
could turn
in

02:54:54.710 --> 02:54:54.720 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:54:59.190 --> 02:54:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:19.070 --> 02:55:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:20.550 --> 02:55:20.560 align:start position:0%
and I do not have written comments with
 
02:55:22.429 --> 02:55:22.439 align:start position:0%
me but we can provide that after if that
 
02:55:25.110 --> 02:55:25.120 align:start position:0%
would be helpful for the committee um
 
02:55:27.510 --> 02:55:27.520 align:start position:0%
good morning uh Mr chair members of the
 
02:55:29.590 --> 02:55:29.600 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Andrew Kingman I
 
02:55:31.830 --> 02:55:31.840 align:start position:0%
represent the state privacy and security
 
02:55:33.990 --> 02:55:34.000 align:start position:0%
Coalition uh we're a new england-based
 
02:55:36.750 --> 02:55:36.760 align:start position:0%
group that represents about 35 companies
 
02:55:40.950 --> 02:55:40.960 align:start position:0%
and six trade associations uh across um
 
02:55:43.750 --> 02:55:43.760 align:start position:0%
the country on on uh bills of this
 
02:55:46.750 --> 02:55:46.760 align:start position:0%
nature um I also have a background as a
 
02:55:48.990 --> 02:55:49.000 align:start position:0%
privacy compliance attorney helping
 
02:55:50.990 --> 02:55:51.000 align:start position:0%
clients work through various privacy
 
02:55:53.510 --> 02:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
laws uh and we're here in respectful
 
02:55:55.550 --> 02:55:55.560 align:start position:0%
opposition to HB
 
02:55:58.309 --> 02:55:58.319 align:start position:0%
195 um there have been some questions
 
02:56:01.150 --> 02:56:01.160 align:start position:0%
about the bill that was passed last year
 
02:56:04.309 --> 02:56:04.319 align:start position:0%
uh so I just wanted to to start with
 
02:56:06.990 --> 02:56:07.000 align:start position:0%
what is in that bill to just sort of set
 
02:56:08.349 --> 02:56:08.359 align:start position:0%
the stage because I think our our
 
02:56:10.910 --> 02:56:10.920 align:start position:0%
position um is probably you know best
 
02:56:12.670 --> 02:56:12.680 align:start position:0%
summed up by representative pz's
 
02:56:15.309 --> 02:56:15.319 align:start position:0%
question which is that last year's Bill
 
02:56:18.349 --> 02:56:18.359 align:start position:0%
addresses almost every issue that is in
 
02:56:19.910 --> 02:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
in uh HB
 
02:56:23.389 --> 02:56:23.399 align:start position:0%
195 uh but does so in a little bit more
 
02:56:27.269 --> 02:56:27.279 align:start position:0%
thorough way uh with defined terms and
 
02:56:30.150 --> 02:56:30.160 align:start position:0%
uh much more kind of accepted framework
 
02:56:34.309 --> 02:56:34.319 align:start position:0%
for how to process personal data uh so
 
02:56:36.790 --> 02:56:36.800 align:start position:0%
last year's comprehensive bill um the
 
02:56:41.349 --> 02:56:41.359 align:start position:0%
intent of that was to cover all sectors
 
02:56:43.830 --> 02:56:43.840 align:start position:0%
of the economy all different types of
 
02:56:46.110 --> 02:56:46.120 align:start position:0%
companies um you know with the exception
 
02:56:48.590 --> 02:56:48.600 align:start position:0%
of some that are are covered by federal
 
02:56:51.790 --> 02:56:51.800 align:start position:0%
like Hippa or Graham leech blly and the
 
02:56:54.870 --> 02:56:54.880 align:start position:0%
reason for that uh for treating all
 
02:56:57.229 --> 02:56:57.239 align:start position:0%
companies uh the same and all of the
 
02:56:59.790 --> 02:56:59.800 align:start position:0%
company's data the same is that we
 
02:57:02.349 --> 02:57:02.359 align:start position:0%
believe consumers should also have the
 
02:57:04.790 --> 02:57:04.800 align:start position:0%
same expectations and shouldn't have to
 
02:57:06.990 --> 02:57:07.000 align:start position:0%
have different uh expectations or
 
02:57:10.150 --> 02:57:10.160 align:start position:0%
controls based on the type of company
 
02:57:11.870 --> 02:57:11.880 align:start position:0%
that they're interacting with right so
 
02:57:13.469 --> 02:57:13.479 align:start position:0%
if I'm a consumer I want to have the
 
02:57:13.479 --> 02:57:14.429 align:start position:0%
if I'm a consumer I want to have the
same

02:57:14.429 --> 02:57:14.439 align:start position:0%
same
 
02:57:17.550 --> 02:57:17.560 align:start position:0%
expectations um across you know whatever
 
02:57:19.550 --> 02:57:19.560 align:start position:0%
company I'm interacting with as to how
 
02:57:24.469 --> 02:57:24.479 align:start position:0%
my data uh is controlled I think uh you
 
02:57:26.830 --> 02:57:26.840 align:start position:0%
know this has been stated uh before so I
 
02:57:31.190 --> 02:57:31.200 align:start position:0%
I won't belabor it but uh that generally
 
02:57:33.510 --> 02:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
sets forth uh some basic
 
02:57:35.990 --> 02:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
Frameworks one is that you have the
 
02:57:39.110 --> 02:57:39.120 align:start position:0%
right to opt out of the sale of your
 
02:57:42.269 --> 02:57:42.279 align:start position:0%
data targeted advertising um and
 
02:57:44.670 --> 02:57:44.680 align:start position:0%
profiling for certain uh types of
 
02:57:47.190 --> 02:57:47.200 align:start position:0%
automated decision-making activities but
 
02:57:49.670 --> 02:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
you were required to provide consent
 
02:57:52.389 --> 02:57:52.399 align:start position:0%
affirmative consent and optin to any
 
02:57:54.670 --> 02:57:54.680 align:start position:0%
processing uh which is defined very very
 
02:57:57.269 --> 02:57:57.279 align:start position:0%
broadly of sensitive data and that
 
02:57:59.670 --> 02:57:59.680 align:start position:0%
includes terms that are defined in that
 
02:58:01.830 --> 02:58:01.840 align:start position:0%
law that are not defined in this law
 
02:58:04.750 --> 02:58:04.760 align:start position:0%
like biometric data uh genetic data
 
02:58:09.990 --> 02:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
precise geolocation data Etc um these
 
02:58:12.389 --> 02:58:12.399 align:start position:0%
definitions in Sp
 
02:58:15.790 --> 02:58:15.800 align:start position:0%
255 is designed to be sustainable over
 
02:58:17.229 --> 02:58:17.239 align:start position:0%
time so you'll notice that the
 
02:58:19.990 --> 02:58:20.000 align:start position:0%
definition in that bill of personal data
 
02:58:22.790 --> 02:58:22.800 align:start position:0%
is uh any data linked or reasonably
 
02:58:24.590 --> 02:58:24.600 align:start position:0%
linkable to an identified or
 
02:58:27.469 --> 02:58:27.479 align:start position:0%
identifiable person it doesn't list out
 
02:58:29.590 --> 02:58:29.600 align:start position:0%
the types of companies covered or the
 
02:58:32.510 --> 02:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
exact types of data covered because it's
 
02:58:34.590 --> 02:58:34.600 align:start position:0%
meant to be adaptable over time as
 
02:58:38.389 --> 02:58:38.399 align:start position:0%
Technologies change um it also I I would
 
02:58:41.510 --> 02:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
just uh take one note with uh something
 
02:58:43.830 --> 02:58:43.840 align:start position:0%
that representative Kirk said regarding
 
02:58:45.790 --> 02:58:45.800 align:start position:0%
having to go through each company to
 
02:58:48.990 --> 02:58:49.000 align:start position:0%
exercise these rights um the bill
 
02:58:51.510 --> 02:58:51.520 align:start position:0%
specifically uh provides a mechanism
 
02:58:53.990 --> 02:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
called the universal opt out mechanism
 
02:58:56.790 --> 02:58:56.800 align:start position:0%
which requires companies to recognize
 
02:58:59.389 --> 02:58:59.399 align:start position:0%
certain browser signals uh that a
 
02:59:01.349 --> 02:59:01.359 align:start position:0%
consumer can put on their browser that
 
02:59:04.750 --> 02:59:04.760 align:start position:0%
says um opt me out of the sale or
 
02:59:07.269 --> 02:59:07.279 align:start position:0%
targeted advertising of my information
 
02:59:09.910 --> 02:59:09.920 align:start position:0%
without having to navigate through a
 
02:59:14.389 --> 02:59:14.399 align:start position:0%
specific site um I think the other basic
 
02:59:17.110 --> 02:59:17.120 align:start position:0%
framework of SP 255 that this build
 
02:59:19.510 --> 02:59:19.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't recognize is this distinction
 
02:59:21.950 --> 02:59:21.960 align:start position:0%
between controllers and processors as Mr
 
02:59:25.830 --> 02:59:25.840 align:start position:0%
gilrain flagged but more specifically um
 
02:59:28.550 --> 02:59:28.560 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't distinguish between
 
02:59:30.750 --> 02:59:30.760 align:start position:0%
them in a way that would require
 
02:59:34.309 --> 02:59:34.319 align:start position:0%
processors which never interact with uh
 
02:59:37.269 --> 02:59:37.279 align:start position:0%
consumers to be obtaining consent for
 
02:59:41.429 --> 02:59:41.439 align:start position:0%
them um anytime uh they needed to do
 
02:59:43.429 --> 02:59:43.439 align:start position:0%
something with that personal data and it
 
02:59:45.950 --> 02:59:45.960 align:start position:0%
would also require controllers which are
 
02:59:47.750 --> 02:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
the consumer facing businesses that most
 
02:59:51.910 --> 02:59:51.920 align:start position:0%
of us uh interact with to obtain consent
 
02:59:55.030 --> 02:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
to provide for instance your address uh
 
02:59:56.710 --> 02:59:56.720 align:start position:0%
when you want to purchase something
 
02:59:59.630 --> 02:59:59.640 align:start position:0%
online um the transmission of that data
 
03:00:02.750 --> 03:00:02.760 align:start position:0%
to your processor that handles shipping
 
03:00:06.429 --> 03:00:06.439 align:start position:0%
um would under this bill require consent
 
03:00:08.510 --> 03:00:08.520 align:start position:0%
but only for certain types of data or
 
03:00:11.150 --> 03:00:11.160 align:start position:0%
certain types of entities right so again
 
03:00:14.990 --> 03:00:15.000 align:start position:0%
we believe that um SP 255 addresses the
 
03:00:17.469 --> 03:00:17.479 align:start position:0%
vast majority of issues that are brought
 
03:00:18.550 --> 03:00:18.560 align:start position:0%
up here
 
03:00:21.309 --> 03:00:21.319 align:start position:0%
um does so in a little bit more fleshed
 
03:00:23.710 --> 03:00:23.720 align:start position:0%
out way that also works with other New
 
03:00:25.630 --> 03:00:25.640 align:start position:0%
England states that have adopted these
 
03:00:28.349 --> 03:00:28.359 align:start position:0%
laws um and again this this law has only
 
03:00:30.950 --> 03:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
been in effect for two months um and so
 
03:00:34.469 --> 03:00:34.479 align:start position:0%
we think it's worth um sort of letting
 
03:00:36.670 --> 03:00:36.680 align:start position:0%
that law mature and see if there are
 
03:00:38.349 --> 03:00:38.359 align:start position:0%
issues with it and if there are we're
 
03:00:39.870 --> 03:00:39.880 align:start position:0%
we're more than willing to address it
 
03:00:41.630 --> 03:00:41.640 align:start position:0%
but you know companies spent the last
 
03:00:45.150 --> 03:00:45.160 align:start position:0%
year working to implement uh the law
 
03:00:46.790 --> 03:00:46.800 align:start position:0%
that's just been in here for two months
 
03:00:48.790 --> 03:00:48.800 align:start position:0%
so we think it's worth uh taking a
 
03:00:50.990 --> 03:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
moment to make sure that that law is
 
03:00:52.950 --> 03:00:52.960 align:start position:0%
working or to identify issues with it
 
03:00:55.990 --> 03:00:56.000 align:start position:0%
before we significantly modify it and do
 
03:00:58.070 --> 03:00:58.080 align:start position:0%
so in a way that doesn't really you know
 
03:00:59.750 --> 03:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
work with the framework that that's
 
03:01:01.910 --> 03:01:01.920 align:start position:0%
accepted there so uh would that happy to
 
03:01:04.590 --> 03:01:04.600 align:start position:0%
take any questions there any
 
03:01:07.590 --> 03:01:07.600 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you
 
03:01:20.630 --> 03:01:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:22.670 --> 03:01:22.680 align:start position:0%
Judiciary members thank you for allowing
 
03:01:24.630 --> 03:01:24.640 align:start position:0%
me to speak today for the record I am
 
03:01:27.670 --> 03:01:27.680 align:start position:0%
Rick Fabo senior director of advocacy
 
03:01:29.429 --> 03:01:29.439 align:start position:0%
and public affairs for the business and
 
03:01:31.830 --> 03:01:31.840 align:start position:0%
industry Association New Hampshire's
 
03:01:34.349 --> 03:01:34.359 align:start position:0%
leading business Advocate I will save
 
03:01:36.910 --> 03:01:36.920 align:start position:0%
time and not repeat uh testimony this
 
03:01:38.590 --> 03:01:38.600 align:start position:0%
the valid points that have made been
 
03:01:41.150 --> 03:01:41.160 align:start position:0%
made already but I want to focus on what
 
03:01:43.349 --> 03:01:43.359 align:start position:0%
I feel is the most important point to
 
03:01:46.990 --> 03:01:47.000 align:start position:0%
consider HP 195 is unnecessary with
 
03:01:49.030 --> 03:01:49.040 align:start position:0%
enactment of the New Hampshire data
 
03:01:53.670 --> 03:01:53.680 align:start position:0%
Privacy Act that's the 507 um that bill
 
03:01:57.110 --> 03:01:57.120 align:start position:0%
re uh came to be law in part by the work
 
03:01:59.750 --> 03:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
of this committee and I will pay you all
 
03:02:01.670 --> 03:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
the respect as well as the Full House
 
03:02:03.870 --> 03:02:03.880 align:start position:0%
the full Senate and the governor that we
 
03:02:07.150 --> 03:02:07.160 align:start position:0%
did not pass a useless bill Senate Bill
 
03:02:10.389 --> 03:02:10.399 align:start position:0%
255 or the model legislation created by
 
03:02:13.030 --> 03:02:13.040 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 255 has now been passed in
 
03:02:15.830 --> 03:02:15.840 align:start position:0%
20 different states and these laws were
 
03:02:18.630 --> 03:02:18.640 align:start position:0%
NE necessitate necessitated because of
 
03:02:21.910 --> 03:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
lack of federal action on data privacy
 
03:02:23.990 --> 03:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
and the model legislation was critically
 
03:02:27.190 --> 03:02:27.200 align:start position:0%
important to avoid a costly and
 
03:02:30.429 --> 03:02:30.439 align:start position:0%
Patchwork of state laws that vary by
 
03:02:33.389 --> 03:02:33.399 align:start position:0%
state the New Hampshire privacy laws has
 
03:02:35.510 --> 03:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
been mentioned just went in fact January
 
03:02:39.349 --> 03:02:39.359 align:start position:0%
1st it is clear on what consent means
 
03:02:41.229 --> 03:02:41.239 align:start position:0%
what is covered and who is subject to
 
03:02:44.990 --> 03:02:45.000 align:start position:0%
the law HB 1995 fails on each of those
 
03:02:47.910 --> 03:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
standards the benefits of model legis
 
03:02:50.469 --> 03:02:50.479 align:start position:0%
islation should not be erased by
 
03:02:52.830 --> 03:02:52.840 align:start position:0%
unnecessary laws that confuse both
 
03:02:56.190 --> 03:02:56.200 align:start position:0%
consumers and businesses please allow
 
03:02:59.630 --> 03:02:59.640 align:start position:0%
our state data Privacy Law to fully take
 
03:03:02.790 --> 03:03:02.800 align:start position:0%
effect it is just in the initial phase
 
03:03:07.150 --> 03:03:07.160 align:start position:0%
for this year where you where the um any
 
03:03:10.150 --> 03:03:10.160 align:start position:0%
violations can be cured on January 1st
 
03:03:13.309 --> 03:03:13.319 align:start position:0%
2026 the full effect of law takes place
 
03:03:15.790 --> 03:03:15.800 align:start position:0%
it it does need time to see uh what
 
03:03:18.349 --> 03:03:18.359 align:start position:0%
works and possibly what may not work
 
03:03:20.710 --> 03:03:20.720 align:start position:0%
with all of that we respectively ask you
 
03:03:23.510 --> 03:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
to vote in expedient to legislate on
 
03:03:26.229 --> 03:03:26.239 align:start position:0%
House Bill 195 and I'm happy to take any
 
03:03:28.990 --> 03:03:29.000 align:start position:0%
questions you might have are there any
 
03:03:31.630 --> 03:03:31.640 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
03:03:54.349 --> 03:03:54.359 align:start position:0%

commitment as you've heard uh broadly
 
03:05:11.389 --> 03:05:11.399 align:start position:0%
507 establishes a privacy framework
 
03:05:13.710 --> 03:05:13.720 align:start position:0%
creating rights for consumers
 
03:05:15.469 --> 03:05:15.479 align:start position:0%
enforceable obligations on private
 
03:05:17.110 --> 03:05:17.120 align:start position:0%
entities that control or process
 
03:05:19.269 --> 03:05:19.279 align:start position:0%
personal data and sensitive
 
03:05:21.550 --> 03:05:21.560 align:start position:0%
data and
 
03:05:24.950 --> 03:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
specifically it creates an optin regime
 
03:05:28.790 --> 03:05:28.800 align:start position:0%
to protect truly sensitive data and as
 
03:05:31.269 --> 03:05:31.279 align:start position:0%
that term is
 
03:05:33.790 --> 03:05:33.800 align:start position:0%
defined it also creates a mechanism for
 
03:05:35.950 --> 03:05:35.960 align:start position:0%
consumers to opt out of the use of data
 
03:05:39.030 --> 03:05:39.040 align:start position:0%
for advertising sale and profiling
 
03:05:42.150 --> 03:05:42.160 align:start position:0%
purposes which terms are also
 
03:05:44.950 --> 03:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
defined importantly it also creates a
 
03:05:46.870 --> 03:05:46.880 align:start position:0%
framework for how companies must
 
03:05:46.880 --> 03:05:48.349 align:start position:0%
framework for how companies must
communicate

03:05:48.349 --> 03:05:48.359 align:start position:0%
communicate
 
03:05:50.710 --> 03:05:50.720 align:start position:0%
through their privacy policies regarding
 
03:05:53.349 --> 03:05:53.359 align:start position:0%
how they use data and who they share
 
03:05:59.070 --> 03:05:59.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:01.710 --> 03:06:01.720 align:start position:0%
purpose this framework as you've heard
 
03:06:04.550 --> 03:06:04.560 align:start position:0%
is well understood by the regulated
 
03:06:08.030 --> 03:06:08.040 align:start position:0%
community and compliance is
 
03:06:08.040 --> 03:06:09.590 align:start position:0%
community and compliance is
widespread

03:06:09.590 --> 03:06:09.600 align:start position:0%
widespread
 
03:06:13.110 --> 03:06:13.120 align:start position:0%
uh our primary objection to House Bill
 
03:06:16.429 --> 03:06:16.439 align:start position:0%
195 is that it proposes changes outside
 
03:06:19.190 --> 03:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
of the framework of five 7h in a
 
03:06:22.349 --> 03:06:22.359 align:start position:0%
parallel and really misaligned
 
03:06:25.750 --> 03:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
way within the context of of the
 
03:06:29.309 --> 03:06:29.319 align:start position:0%
background and our knowledge of 507 H
 
03:06:31.150 --> 03:06:31.160 align:start position:0%
I'm going to point out a few specific
 
03:06:34.150 --> 03:06:34.160 align:start position:0%
flaws that we see in the language as
 
03:06:38.110 --> 03:06:38.120 align:start position:0%
drafted the terms don't align uh between
 
03:06:41.630 --> 03:06:41.640 align:start position:0%
House Bill 195 and our current law for
 
03:06:44.790 --> 03:06:44.800 align:start position:0%
example House Bill 195 would require
 
03:06:47.550 --> 03:06:47.560 align:start position:0%
isps and cable television providers to
 
03:06:50.110 --> 03:06:50.120 align:start position:0%
obain optin consent from consumers
 
03:06:52.389 --> 03:06:52.399 align:start position:0%
before disclosing or making available to
 
03:06:56.190 --> 03:06:56.200 align:start position:0%
any person a broad range of information
 
03:06:58.389 --> 03:06:58.399 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether the information
 
03:07:01.990 --> 03:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
was necessary to provide an underlying
 
03:07:04.389 --> 03:07:04.399 align:start position:0%
service for example that limits
 
03:07:07.229 --> 03:07:07.239 align:start position:0%
information sharing between our members
 
03:07:09.910 --> 03:07:09.920 align:start position:0%
and their business partners from
 
03:07:12.110 --> 03:07:12.120 align:start position:0%
anything from uh authentication
 
03:07:14.429 --> 03:07:14.439 align:start position:0%
technology to signing in and out of
 
03:07:17.190 --> 03:07:17.200 align:start position:0%
services uh to navigate across platforms
 
03:07:19.190 --> 03:07:19.200 align:start position:0%
for for
 
03:07:22.830 --> 03:07:22.840 align:start position:0%
example 195 also seeks to protect
 
03:07:25.750 --> 03:07:25.760 align:start position:0%
individuals as opposed to Consumers this
 
03:07:29.990 --> 03:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
is important to point out as um it's an
 
03:07:32.269 --> 03:07:32.279 align:start position:0%
important distinction because a company
 
03:07:35.510 --> 03:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
for example couldn't disclose under this
 
03:07:39.070 --> 03:07:39.080 align:start position:0%
law the names and addresses of employees
 
03:07:42.229 --> 03:07:42.239 align:start position:0%
I.E individuals for purposes of payroll
 
03:07:44.550 --> 03:07:44.560 align:start position:0%
without first obtaining optin
 
03:07:47.030 --> 03:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
consent moving on the definition of
 
03:07:49.229 --> 03:07:49.239 align:start position:0%
personal information is very Broad and
 
03:07:52.510 --> 03:07:52.520 align:start position:0%
problematic in many respects it does not
 
03:07:56.389 --> 03:07:56.399 align:start position:0%
distinguish between sensitive data I.E
 
03:07:59.070 --> 03:07:59.080 align:start position:0%
genetic and biometric data as protected
 
03:08:02.710 --> 03:08:02.720 align:start position:0%
under 507 and nonsensitive data that's
 
03:08:05.229 --> 03:08:05.239 align:start position:0%
available from public sources names
 
03:08:07.030 --> 03:08:07.040 align:start position:0%
addresses phone
 
03:08:11.150 --> 03:08:11.160 align:start position:0%
numbers one 195 also uses vague terms
 
03:08:13.190 --> 03:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
like location
 
03:08:15.150 --> 03:08:15.160 align:start position:0%
information we don't know what that
 
03:08:17.510 --> 03:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
means is this sensitive location data
 
03:08:22.630 --> 03:08:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:26.070 --> 03:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
data moreover uh the phrase available to
 
03:08:31.429 --> 03:08:31.439 align:start position:0%
the public is used um it is unclear to
 
03:08:34.710 --> 03:08:34.720 align:start position:0%
us and uh is quite confusing in the
 
03:08:37.269 --> 03:08:37.279 align:start position:0%
context of looking at 507 H when we also
 
03:08:41.469 --> 03:08:41.479 align:start position:0%
see a defined term publicly available so
 
03:08:44.670 --> 03:08:44.680 align:start position:0%
the lack of clarity uh really frustrates
 
03:08:47.830 --> 03:08:47.840 align:start position:0%
compliance efforts and enforcement and
 
03:08:50.750 --> 03:08:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:53.870 --> 03:08:53.880 align:start position:0%
problematic 195 would upend the careful
 
03:08:55.670 --> 03:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
balance that we worked very hard to
 
03:08:58.309 --> 03:08:58.319 align:start position:0%
achieve in 507 H by subjecting all
 
03:09:00.510 --> 03:09:00.520 align:start position:0%
personal information regardless of
 
03:09:03.510 --> 03:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
sensitivity to opt-in consent thereby
 
03:09:06.229 --> 03:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
interfering with business and network
 
03:09:09.349 --> 03:09:09.359 align:start position:0%
operations this really could impede uh
 
03:09:13.630 --> 03:09:13.640 align:start position:0%
digital Commerce and degrade internet
 
03:09:16.630 --> 03:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
experiences to the contrary 507
 
03:09:19.309 --> 03:09:19.319 align:start position:0%
recognizes every entity that uses data
 
03:09:21.269 --> 03:09:21.279 align:start position:0%
in one of two
 
03:09:24.190 --> 03:09:24.200 align:start position:0%
ways the control of data and the
 
03:09:26.070 --> 03:09:26.080 align:start position:0%
processing of data and you've heard
 
03:09:34.070 --> 03:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:35.990 --> 03:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
morning in
 
03:09:39.269 --> 03:09:39.279 align:start position:0%
sumary we believe that 195 is
 
03:09:41.469 --> 03:09:41.479 align:start position:0%
unnecessary it does not provide
 
03:09:44.190 --> 03:09:44.200 align:start position:0%
additional benefits to Consumers we
 
03:09:48.790 --> 03:09:48.800 align:start position:0%
agree that 507 H needs time to work
 
03:09:50.990 --> 03:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
uh I do want to point out before I
 
03:09:53.910 --> 03:09:53.920 align:start position:0%
conclude that uh law enforcement
 
03:09:55.510 --> 03:09:55.520 align:start position:0%
requests are already addressed under
 
03:09:57.990 --> 03:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
current state and federal laws under
 
03:09:59.309 --> 03:09:59.319 align:start position:0%
federal law the Electronic
 
03:10:01.630 --> 03:10:01.640 align:start position:0%
Communications Privacy Act regulates how
 
03:10:03.429 --> 03:10:03.439 align:start position:0%
voice data and video providers May
 
03:10:05.670 --> 03:10:05.680 align:start position:0%
disclose information to federal state
 
03:10:08.229 --> 03:10:08.239 align:start position:0%
and local government entities and state
 
03:10:10.830 --> 03:10:10.840 align:start position:0%
statutes specify in detail the lawful
 
03:10:12.349 --> 03:10:12.359 align:start position:0%
sharing of information with law
 
03:10:12.359 --> 03:10:15.190 align:start position:0%
sharing of information with law
enforcement

03:10:15.190 --> 03:10:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:17.590 --> 03:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
entities uh as we've discussed conected
 
03:10:19.590 --> 03:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
members are required to communicate our
 
03:10:22.630 --> 03:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
privacy policies and those policies are
 
03:10:25.150 --> 03:10:25.160 align:start position:0%
legally enforcable
 
03:10:27.469 --> 03:10:27.479 align:start position:0%
commitments in conclusion we would
 
03:10:30.630 --> 03:10:30.640 align:start position:0%
recommend that you we would urge you to
 
03:10:33.870 --> 03:10:33.880 align:start position:0%
recommend HB 1995 inexpedient to
 
03:10:36.910 --> 03:10:36.920 align:start position:0%
legislate is there are unintended and
 
03:10:39.870 --> 03:10:39.880 align:start position:0%
undesirable consequences we do not
 
03:10:41.830 --> 03:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
believe that this clarifies the law in
 
03:10:44.309 --> 03:10:44.319 align:start position:0%
any way and would not serve the interest
 
03:10:46.750 --> 03:10:46.760 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire consumers I thank you
 
03:10:48.389 --> 03:10:48.399 align:start position:0%

03:10:51.150 --> 03:10:51.160 align:start position:0%

questions seeing none thank you thank

cormack good afternoon members of the
 
03:11:17.550 --> 03:11:17.560 align:start position:0%
committee you were on no yep
 
03:11:18.870 --> 03:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
good afternoon members of the committee
 
03:11:20.389 --> 03:11:20.399 align:start position:0%
my name is Warren Cormac I'm the
 
03:11:22.269 --> 03:11:22.279 align:start position:0%
Assistant Attorney General in the New
 
03:11:23.630 --> 03:11:23.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Justice who
 
03:11:25.870 --> 03:11:25.880 align:start position:0%
leads the data privacy unit as within
 
03:11:27.950 --> 03:11:27.960 align:start position:0%
the consumer protection and antitrust
 
03:11:30.150 --> 03:11:30.160 align:start position:0%
Bureau uh I would be responsible for
 
03:11:31.910 --> 03:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
enforcing this
 
03:11:34.550 --> 03:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
law the Attorney General is not
 
03:11:36.830 --> 03:11:36.840 align:start position:0%
commenting uh in support or opposition
 
03:11:40.349 --> 03:11:40.359 align:start position:0%
to this bill uh nor uh commenting on the
 
03:11:42.550 --> 03:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
rights that it provides opt-in consent
 
03:11:45.309 --> 03:11:45.319 align:start position:0%
or application to third party
 
03:11:47.590 --> 03:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
providers my testimony here today is to
 
03:11:48.950 --> 03:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
raise some issues with the language and
 
03:11:50.389 --> 03:11:50.399 align:start position:0%
structure of this
 
03:11:54.150 --> 03:11:54.160 align:start position:0%
bill currently RSA 507 is enforced
 
03:11:57.950 --> 03:11:57.960 align:start position:0%
through the consumer protection act RSA
 
03:12:01.190 --> 03:12:01.200 align:start position:0%
358a and the consumer protection act has
 
03:12:03.550 --> 03:12:03.560 align:start position:0%
certain penalties and enforcement
 
03:12:06.349 --> 03:12:06.359 align:start position:0%
ability built in it that would apply to
 
03:12:08.910 --> 03:12:08.920 align:start position:0%
507 for example the consumer protection
 
03:12:11.150 --> 03:12:11.160 align:start position:0%
act allows the Attorney General to seek
 
03:12:14.510 --> 03:12:14.520 align:start position:0%
injunctions uh for conduct engaged in by
 
03:12:16.550 --> 03:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
uh entities that violate the consumer
 
03:12:18.429 --> 03:12:18.439 align:start position:0%
protection act or
 
03:12:20.750 --> 03:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
507 there's also subpoena Authority
 
03:12:22.389 --> 03:12:22.399 align:start position:0%
administrative subpoena Authority
 
03:12:23.950 --> 03:12:23.960 align:start position:0%
written in
 
03:12:27.469 --> 03:12:27.479 align:start position:0%
358a that violators of 507 would be
 
03:12:27.479 --> 03:12:29.550 align:start position:0%
358a that violators of 507 would be
subject

03:12:29.550 --> 03:12:29.560 align:start position:0%
subject
 
03:12:29.560 --> 03:12:31.349 align:start position:0%
subject
to

03:12:31.349 --> 03:12:31.359 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:12:35.510 --> 03:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
and RSA 358a the consumer protection act
 
03:12:38.229 --> 03:12:38.239 align:start position:0%
has $10,000 penalties per violation up
 
03:12:40.309 --> 03:12:40.319 align:start position:0%
to $10,000 penalties per violation of
 
03:12:43.710 --> 03:12:43.720 align:start position:0%
that act this bill uh does not have any
 
03:12:45.550 --> 03:12:45.560 align:start position:0%
provision for injunctions it doesn't
 
03:12:46.750 --> 03:12:46.760 align:start position:0%
have any provision for subpoena
 
03:12:46.760 --> 03:12:47.790 align:start position:0%
have any provision for subpoena
Authority

03:12:47.790 --> 03:12:47.800 align:start position:0%
Authority
 
03:12:50.030 --> 03:12:50.040 align:start position:0%
and the penalties that could be issued
 
03:12:52.229 --> 03:12:52.239 align:start position:0%
under this bill are up to
 
03:12:57.550 --> 03:12:57.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:00.830 --> 03:13:00.840 align:start position:0%
it if the legislature is interested in
 
03:13:02.309 --> 03:13:02.319 align:start position:0%
passing this bill uh the consumer
 
03:13:04.389 --> 03:13:04.399 align:start position:0%
protection act uh Consumer Protection
 
03:13:07.030 --> 03:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
Bureau would like to have the ability to
 
03:13:09.870 --> 03:13:09.880 align:start position:0%
stop harmful conduct through injunctions
 
03:13:11.510 --> 03:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
and seek meaningful penalties for
 
03:13:15.429 --> 03:13:15.439 align:start position:0%
violations of data privacy
 
03:13:19.229 --> 03:13:19.239 align:start position:0%
principles and so there are two possible
 
03:13:21.870 --> 03:13:21.880 align:start position:0%
ways of going about this uh if this were
 
03:13:23.349 --> 03:13:23.359 align:start position:0%
tied in with
 
03:13:26.269 --> 03:13:26.279 align:start position:0%
358a it would be subject to the
 
03:13:28.429 --> 03:13:28.439 align:start position:0%
exceptions in
 
03:13:30.590 --> 03:13:30.600 align:start position:0%
358a and so that's one way of going
 
03:13:34.670 --> 03:13:34.680 align:start position:0%
about it or if this Bill had the added
 
03:13:37.910 --> 03:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh enforcement ability that's present in
 
03:13:41.710 --> 03:13:41.720 align:start position:0%
358a uh then it would bring it to the
 
03:13:42.910 --> 03:13:42.920 align:start position:0%
level where it would be able to be
 
03:13:46.110 --> 03:13:46.120 align:start position:0%
enforced similar to the way that RSA 507
 
03:13:48.630 --> 03:13:48.640 align:start position:0%
is able to be enforced
 
03:13:51.950 --> 03:13:51.960 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you are there any
 
03:13:54.550 --> 03:13:54.560 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
03:13:56.910 --> 03:13:56.920 align:start position:0%
you that's the last card I have for
 
03:13:57.990 --> 03:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
03:13:59.910 --> 03:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
195 is there anyone else here that
 
03:14:01.269 --> 03:14:01.279 align:start position:0%
wishes to speak on it that hasn't turned
 
03:14:02.830 --> 03:14:02.840 align:start position:0%
a card
 
03:14:05.070 --> 03:14:05.080 align:start position:0%
in seeing none I'm going to close the
 
03:14:08.389 --> 03:14:08.399 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 195 and open the
 
03:14:10.429 --> 03:14:10.439 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill
 
03:14:13.070 --> 03:14:13.080 align:start position:0%
522 relative to the expectation of
 
03:14:14.830 --> 03:14:14.840 align:start position:0%
privacy and personal information
 
03:14:17.670 --> 03:14:17.680 align:start position:0%
maintained by the state
 
03:14:19.630 --> 03:14:19.640 align:start position:0%
I recognize representative Lynn to
 
03:14:37.469 --> 03:14:37.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:39.950 --> 03:14:39.960 align:start position:0%
Bill thank thank you Mr chair members of
 
03:14:41.990 --> 03:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
the committee I I believe this is the
 
03:14:44.469 --> 03:14:44.479 align:start position:0%
last time I will be up here at least
 
03:14:50.950 --> 03:14:50.960 align:start position:0%
today uh 52 two is not a bill that we um
 
03:14:54.389 --> 03:14:54.399 align:start position:0%
enacted or uh that we I don't even think
 
03:14:55.870 --> 03:14:55.880 align:start position:0%
we considered it to be honest with you
 
03:14:57.190 --> 03:14:57.200 align:start position:0%
last year but we certainly didn't enact
 
03:15:00.630 --> 03:15:00.640 align:start position:0%
it um it
 
03:15:03.590 --> 03:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
um as you can see representative Earth
 
03:15:07.710 --> 03:15:07.720 align:start position:0%
is the prime sponsor of this bill and um
 
03:15:10.630 --> 03:15:10.640 align:start position:0%
this bill for lack of a better term is
 
03:15:13.550 --> 03:15:13.560 align:start position:0%
kind of the flip uh a is intended as a
 
03:15:19.110 --> 03:15:19.120 align:start position:0%
complement to 195 195 is directed at the
 
03:15:21.630 --> 03:15:21.640 align:start position:0%
thirdparty providers of information and
 
03:15:23.950 --> 03:15:23.960 align:start position:0%
services and it
 
03:15:26.990 --> 03:15:27.000 align:start position:0%
prevents those entities from dis making
 
03:15:31.070 --> 03:15:31.080 align:start position:0%
disclosures unless the the provisions of
 
03:15:35.550 --> 03:15:35.560 align:start position:0%
195 um are complied with and as was just
 
03:15:39.510 --> 03:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
um mentioned that that bill does not
 
03:15:42.189 --> 03:15:42.199 align:start position:0%
have a private right of action in it
 
03:15:44.150 --> 03:15:44.160 align:start position:0%
because it so that other words private
 
03:15:45.870 --> 03:15:45.880 align:start position:0%
individuals would not be able to sue any
 
03:15:48.870 --> 03:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
of those businesses if there was a
 
03:15:52.510 --> 03:15:52.520 align:start position:0%
violation 522 is directed to
 
03:15:52.520 --> 03:15:53.990 align:start position:0%
violation 522 is directed to
governmental

03:15:53.990 --> 03:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
governmental
 
03:15:58.389 --> 03:15:58.399 align:start position:0%
entities um and it basically says that I
 
03:16:01.910 --> 03:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
mean the the key provision the the way
 
03:16:05.309 --> 03:16:05.319 align:start position:0%
this bill is structured is the key
 
03:16:08.550 --> 03:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
provision is RSA
 
03:16:13.710 --> 03:16:13.720 align:start position:0%
507 uh I colon 2 Roman numeral
 
03:16:17.189 --> 03:16:17.199 align:start position:0%
2 no governmental entity shall acquire
 
03:16:19.349 --> 03:16:19.359 align:start position:0%
retain or use any personal information
 
03:16:21.590 --> 03:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
of any individual residing in New
 
03:16:24.590 --> 03:16:24.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire from any third party provider
 
03:16:27.269 --> 03:16:27.279 align:start position:0%
so if you stop right there you say uh oh
 
03:16:29.710 --> 03:16:29.720 align:start position:0%
how's government going to do its job
 
03:16:31.550 --> 03:16:31.560 align:start position:0%
because that's the that's the flat
 
03:16:35.309 --> 03:16:35.319 align:start position:0%
prohibition but then if you go on to
 
03:16:35.319 --> 03:16:36.670 align:start position:0%
prohibition but then if you go on to
paragraph

03:16:36.670 --> 03:16:36.680 align:start position:0%
paragraph
 
03:16:39.910 --> 03:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
three you'll see that there's there's a
 
03:16:43.550 --> 03:16:43.560 align:start position:0%
there's a huge carve out of exceptions
 
03:16:46.389 --> 03:16:46.399 align:start position:0%
where which basically says government
 
03:16:50.870 --> 03:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
can do it job um if there are uh
 
03:16:54.349 --> 03:16:54.359 align:start position:0%
reasons uh why the government collects
 
03:16:56.990 --> 03:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
information and let's you know I let's
 
03:16:58.710 --> 03:16:58.720 align:start position:0%
let's hope I think this is the case
 
03:17:00.830 --> 03:17:00.840 align:start position:0%
especially in a place like New Hampshire
 
03:17:02.670 --> 03:17:02.680 align:start position:0%
generally government is not collecting
 
03:17:05.550 --> 03:17:05.560 align:start position:0%
information for nefarious purposes um
 
03:17:07.590 --> 03:17:07.600 align:start position:0%
they're generally collecting it for for
 
03:17:10.590 --> 03:17:10.600 align:start position:0%
appropriate purposes and in SEC
 
03:17:13.070 --> 03:17:13.080 align:start position:0%
paragraph uh Roman numeral 3 which
 
03:17:14.349 --> 03:17:14.359 align:start position:0%
begins on line
 
03:17:18.389 --> 03:17:18.399 align:start position:0%
29 on page one of the bill over
 
03:17:21.790 --> 03:17:21.800 align:start position:0%
through um line
 
03:17:26.309 --> 03:17:26.319 align:start position:0%
uh 28 on page two of the bill that um or
 
03:17:30.670 --> 03:17:30.680 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry not line 28 but line 23 um it
 
03:17:34.030 --> 03:17:34.040 align:start position:0%
spells out all the uh proper reasons
 
03:17:37.070 --> 03:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
that government contain can obtain
 
03:17:42.389 --> 03:17:42.399 align:start position:0%
information and then this um this bill
 
03:17:48.429 --> 03:17:48.439 align:start position:0%
unlike um 195 this does allow a private
 
03:17:52.550 --> 03:17:52.560 align:start position:0%
cause of action um and I think the the
 
03:17:57.429 --> 03:17:57.439 align:start position:0%
rationale there is that um if the
 
03:17:57.439 --> 03:17:59.150 align:start position:0%
rationale there is that um if the
uh

03:17:59.150 --> 03:17:59.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:18:01.910 --> 03:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
that there are reasons why it may make
 
03:18:04.189 --> 03:18:04.199 align:start position:0%
sense to allow a private individual to
 
03:18:05.710 --> 03:18:05.720 align:start position:0%
have a cause of action against the
 
03:18:07.309 --> 03:18:07.319 align:start position:0%
government where it wouldn't make sense
 
03:18:09.229 --> 03:18:09.239 align:start position:0%
to allow them to have a cause of action
 
03:18:13.469 --> 03:18:13.479 align:start position:0%
against uh private businesses um and so
 
03:18:15.550 --> 03:18:15.560 align:start position:0%
that I mean that basically that's the
 
03:18:19.229 --> 03:18:19.239 align:start position:0%
the rationale uh for that so with that U
 
03:18:22.750 --> 03:18:22.760 align:start position:0%
I know um representative representative
 
03:18:26.189 --> 03:18:26.199 align:start position:0%
Kirk is here um who who also uh has a
 
03:18:28.550 --> 03:18:28.560 align:start position:0%
strong interest in this bill um I think
 
03:18:30.550 --> 03:18:30.560 align:start position:0%
it's a good bill I think it does
 
03:18:30.560 --> 03:18:31.670 align:start position:0%
it's a good bill I think it does
complement

03:18:31.670 --> 03:18:31.680 align:start position:0%
complement
 
03:18:34.910 --> 03:18:34.920 align:start position:0%
195 um I'm happy to answer questions and
 
03:18:37.389 --> 03:18:37.399 align:start position:0%
that and that's about all I have to say
 
03:18:39.030 --> 03:18:39.040 align:start position:0%
are there any
 
03:18:41.670 --> 03:18:41.680 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank
 
03:18:43.790 --> 03:18:43.800 align:start position:0%
you you could tell what time it is when
 
03:18:48.110 --> 03:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:49.349 --> 03:18:49.359 align:start position:0%
uh Neil
 
03:18:54.670 --> 03:18:54.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:56.590 --> 03:18:56.600 align:start position:0%
understand thank you Mr chairman I'm
 
03:18:58.510 --> 03:18:58.520 align:start position:0%
glad to think uh you feel that I'm
 
03:19:00.750 --> 03:19:00.760 align:start position:0%
honorable but I'm not sure what the
 
03:19:04.950 --> 03:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
correct procedure is for addressing a
 
03:19:04.960 --> 03:19:06.550 align:start position:0%
correct procedure is for addressing a
retired

03:19:06.550 --> 03:19:06.560 align:start position:0%
retired
 
03:19:08.750 --> 03:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
representative um representative Smith
 
03:19:11.429 --> 03:19:11.439 align:start position:0%
probably knows honorable thank you
 
03:19:13.870 --> 03:19:13.880 align:start position:0%
honorable yes good afternoon Mr chairman
 
03:19:15.030 --> 03:19:15.040 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee for the
 
03:19:17.510 --> 03:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
record I'm Neil Kirk I live in we and
 
03:19:21.750 --> 03:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
I'm here representing myself um 522 is
 
03:19:24.950 --> 03:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
different from 195 195 covered both the
 
03:19:28.830 --> 03:19:28.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:31.870 --> 03:19:31.880 align:start position:0%
sector 522 only applies to the
 
03:19:34.269 --> 03:19:34.279 align:start position:0%
government sector
 
03:19:34.279 --> 03:19:35.870 align:start position:0%
government sector
so

03:19:35.870 --> 03:19:35.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:19:38.630 --> 03:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
the various interests that might have
 
03:19:41.030 --> 03:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
testified against 195 would not be
 
03:19:44.309 --> 03:19:44.319 align:start position:0%
concerned with 522 because it only
 
03:19:45.429 --> 03:19:45.439 align:start position:0%
applies to
 
03:19:50.510 --> 03:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:54.550 --> 03:19:54.560 align:start position:0%
again like 195 this does not deal with
 
03:19:58.030 --> 03:19:58.040 align:start position:0%
all privacy interests with respect to
 
03:20:00.950 --> 03:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
information and government it only deals
 
03:20:02.950 --> 03:20:02.960 align:start position:0%
again with these third-party providers
 
03:20:04.950 --> 03:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
of information and services so this is
 
03:20:08.110 --> 03:20:08.120 align:start position:0%
not a broad sweeping bill that covers
 
03:20:09.710 --> 03:20:09.720 align:start position:0%
every kind of information that
 
03:20:12.269 --> 03:20:12.279 align:start position:0%
government might seek it only applies to
 
03:20:15.070 --> 03:20:15.080 align:start position:0%
the information that we provide to third
 
03:20:16.870 --> 03:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
provide third party providers of
 
03:20:18.950 --> 03:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
services and information and it
 
03:20:21.110 --> 03:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
basically says when the state wants
 
03:20:23.790 --> 03:20:23.800 align:start position:0%
information from them it can't get it
 
03:20:26.189 --> 03:20:26.199 align:start position:0%
unless as representative Lynn said it
 
03:20:27.990 --> 03:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
falls under one of these exceptions and
 
03:20:30.510 --> 03:20:30.520 align:start position:0%
the exceptions are very broad uh
 
03:20:32.790 --> 03:20:32.800 align:start position:0%
representative F and I dealt several
 
03:20:34.910 --> 03:20:34.920 align:start position:0%
years ago with a variety of state
 
03:20:37.229 --> 03:20:37.239 align:start position:0%
agencies to try to get the language that
 
03:20:40.110 --> 03:20:40.120 align:start position:0%
would allow them to continue to do their
 
03:20:43.110 --> 03:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
jobs and still protect privacy and that
 
03:20:52.510 --> 03:20:52.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:52.520 --> 03:20:53.990 align:start position:0%
 
line

03:20:53.990 --> 03:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
line
 
03:20:56.429 --> 03:20:56.439 align:start position:0%
one this is an
 
03:20:59.189 --> 03:20:59.199 align:start position:0%
exception personal information acquired
 
03:21:01.469 --> 03:21:01.479 align:start position:0%
collected retained or used by any state
 
03:21:04.150 --> 03:21:04.160 align:start position:0%
regulatory or administrative
 
03:21:06.830 --> 03:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
agency when such acquisition collection
 
03:21:09.590 --> 03:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
retention or use is within the agency's
 
03:21:13.429 --> 03:21:13.439 align:start position:0%
regulatory investigative adjudicatory or
 
03:21:13.439 --> 03:21:14.950 align:start position:0%
regulatory investigative adjudicatory or
administrative

03:21:14.950 --> 03:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
administrative
 
03:21:18.429 --> 03:21:18.439 align:start position:0%
function um and so the insurance
 
03:21:20.469 --> 03:21:20.479 align:start position:0%
department for example can continue to
 
03:21:24.070 --> 03:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
use or gain access to these various
 
03:21:26.510 --> 03:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
sources of information when it is
 
03:21:29.229 --> 03:21:29.239 align:start position:0%
fulfilling its statutory
 
03:21:29.239 --> 03:21:31.550 align:start position:0%
fulfilling its statutory
functions

03:21:31.550 --> 03:21:31.560 align:start position:0%
functions
 
03:21:31.560 --> 03:21:33.630 align:start position:0%
functions
um

03:21:33.630 --> 03:21:33.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:21:38.910 --> 03:21:38.920 align:start position:0%
the one issue which is addressed in 195
 
03:21:41.150 --> 03:21:41.160 align:start position:0%
which is not really addressed here is to
 
03:21:43.750 --> 03:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
is it has to do with the state police or
 
03:21:46.590 --> 03:21:46.600 align:start position:0%
any police um the way this is set up the
 
03:21:48.110 --> 03:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
cops would have to get a a search
 
03:21:51.070 --> 03:21:51.080 align:start position:0%
warrant in order to get information from
 
03:21:53.510 --> 03:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
any of these sources uh that poses a
 
03:21:57.830 --> 03:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
real problem for them in 195 it was said
 
03:21:59.189 --> 03:21:59.199 align:start position:0%
they didn't get and need to get a search
 
03:22:01.990 --> 03:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
warrant they could still use a um
 
03:22:03.429 --> 03:22:03.439 align:start position:0%
subpoena which as you know is an
 
03:22:06.990 --> 03:22:07.000 align:start position:0%
administrative kind of device but it
 
03:22:09.150 --> 03:22:09.160 align:start position:0%
required them to give notice to the
 
03:22:10.750 --> 03:22:10.760 align:start position:0%
person about whom they were collecting
 
03:22:12.750 --> 03:22:12.760 align:start position:0%
information and give that person an
 
03:22:15.229 --> 03:22:15.239 align:start position:0%
opportunity to contest The subpoena that
 
03:22:17.030 --> 03:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
is obviously a problem for for the
 
03:22:19.590 --> 03:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
police and how that's worked out I don't
 
03:22:21.429 --> 03:22:21.439 align:start position:0%
know but that provision is not in this
 
03:22:23.630 --> 03:22:23.640 align:start position:0%
bill and you might want to include that
 
03:22:27.990 --> 03:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
provision from 195 in
 
03:22:28.000 --> 03:22:31.670 align:start position:0%
provision from 195 in
522

03:22:31.670 --> 03:22:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:34.469 --> 03:22:34.479 align:start position:0%
um there's a penalty here individuals
 
03:22:35.590 --> 03:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
have a right to
 
03:22:38.910 --> 03:22:38.920 align:start position:0%
sue um there's a prevention there's a
 
03:22:40.790 --> 03:22:40.800 align:start position:0%
clause here which says if the federal
 
03:22:43.670 --> 03:22:43.680 align:start position:0%
law preempts this the federal law
 
03:22:46.550 --> 03:22:46.560 align:start position:0%
prevails um
 
03:22:49.110 --> 03:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
this bill is not as broad as 195 and
 
03:22:52.030 --> 03:22:52.040 align:start position:0%
from my point of view it's it it it's
 
03:22:54.670 --> 03:22:54.680 align:start position:0%
not as desirable but I understand the
 
03:22:56.910 --> 03:22:56.920 align:start position:0%
opposition to 195 and if this committee
 
03:23:00.590 --> 03:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
decides to hold on to 195 to work on it
 
03:23:03.550 --> 03:23:03.560 align:start position:0%
or to do something else with the bill um
 
03:23:06.790 --> 03:23:06.800 align:start position:0%
I would still recommend that you look to
 
03:23:10.110 --> 03:23:10.120 align:start position:0%
522 modify it as you need to because
 
03:23:12.429 --> 03:23:12.439 align:start position:0%
this does implement the Privacy
 
03:23:15.189 --> 03:23:15.199 align:start position:0%
Amendment and says and places limits on
 
03:23:17.349 --> 03:23:17.359 align:start position:0%
what state government can do to access
 
03:23:20.349 --> 03:23:20.359 align:start position:0%
our information uh representative Earth
 
03:23:22.990 --> 03:23:23.000 align:start position:0%
asked me um what do this does this
 
03:23:24.469 --> 03:23:24.479 align:start position:0%
prevent the state from collecting
 
03:23:27.070 --> 03:23:27.080 align:start position:0%
databases or creating databases on
 
03:23:29.349 --> 03:23:29.359 align:start position:0%
individual the answer is
 
03:23:32.469 --> 03:23:32.479 align:start position:0%
no um the state can create a database on
 
03:23:35.469 --> 03:23:35.479 align:start position:0%
individuals but the only information
 
03:23:37.189 --> 03:23:37.199 align:start position:0%
that could go into that database would
 
03:23:39.750 --> 03:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
be publicly in publicly available
 
03:23:42.349 --> 03:23:42.359 align:start position:0%
information so if I went on Facebook and
 
03:23:44.269 --> 03:23:44.279 align:start position:0%
posted a whole bunch of pictures and let
 
03:23:47.189 --> 03:23:47.199 align:start position:0%
the world see those there's nothing in
 
03:23:48.750 --> 03:23:48.760 align:start position:0%
this bill that would prevent this would
 
03:23:50.229 --> 03:23:50.239 align:start position:0%
prevent the state and I don't know that
 
03:23:54.429 --> 03:23:54.439 align:start position:0%
they're doing it now from starting a uh
 
03:23:57.030 --> 03:23:57.040 align:start position:0%
database on Neil Kirk and putting all of
 
03:24:00.349 --> 03:24:00.359 align:start position:0%
those pictures from Facebook in that
 
03:24:02.710 --> 03:24:02.720 align:start position:0%
database but what they couldn't do in
 
03:24:04.269 --> 03:24:04.279 align:start position:0%
that database is including any
 
03:24:07.269 --> 03:24:07.279 align:start position:0%
information from telephone companies
 
03:24:09.429 --> 03:24:09.439 align:start position:0%
internet providers service providers and
 
03:24:11.750 --> 03:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
so forth into that database that would
 
03:24:14.630 --> 03:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
be prohibited under this bill but not a
 
03:24:17.229 --> 03:24:17.239 align:start position:0%
database itself why representative Earth
 
03:24:18.950 --> 03:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
was concerned about databases I don't
 
03:24:22.510 --> 03:24:22.520 align:start position:0%
know as far as I know the state does not
 
03:24:25.030 --> 03:24:25.040 align:start position:0%
have databases on individuals except in
 
03:24:28.189 --> 03:24:28.199 align:start position:0%
connection with investigatory activities
 
03:24:30.910 --> 03:24:30.920 align:start position:0%
that are the legitimate function of
 
03:24:34.030 --> 03:24:34.040 align:start position:0%
agencies to Summit up whatever you do
 
03:24:38.030 --> 03:24:38.040 align:start position:0%
with 195 522 should go forward modify it
 
03:24:41.110 --> 03:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
as you need to do to account for
 
03:24:43.750 --> 03:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
particular state agency issues thank you
 
03:24:45.349 --> 03:24:45.359 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman if there are questions I'd
 
03:24:47.349 --> 03:24:47.359 align:start position:0%
be prepared to answer even if it goes
 
03:24:50.670 --> 03:24:50.680 align:start position:0%
into lunchtime are there any
 
03:24:52.910 --> 03:24:52.920 align:start position:0%
questions representative Smith might
 
03:24:56.229 --> 03:24:56.239 align:start position:0%
have one I'm I'm sorry but I I'm a
 
03:24:58.269 --> 03:24:58.279 align:start position:0%
little confused because you said just
 
03:25:02.950 --> 03:25:02.960 align:start position:0%
said something about um
 
03:25:06.110 --> 03:25:06.120 align:start position:0%
195 uh with reference to the state
 
03:25:09.590 --> 03:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
police and I was pleased to see that the
 
03:25:11.229 --> 03:25:11.239 align:start position:0%
representatives of the State Police is
 
03:25:14.510 --> 03:25:14.520 align:start position:0%
still here because I believe that the
 
03:25:16.910 --> 03:25:16.920 align:start position:0%
sponsor and others
 
03:25:19.510 --> 03:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
uh say that there is a very clear
 
03:25:22.150 --> 03:25:22.160 align:start position:0%
exception in uh
 
03:25:25.630 --> 03:25:25.640 align:start position:0%
195 in situation and I know we're
 
03:25:28.870 --> 03:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
talking about 522 now but you're you've
 
03:25:30.950 --> 03:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
just combined them so it's very
 
03:25:33.269 --> 03:25:33.279 align:start position:0%
important to note that there is an
 
03:25:36.110 --> 03:25:36.120 align:start position:0%
exception when an emergency situation
 
03:25:41.030 --> 03:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
exists and you can't go through the um
 
03:25:42.950 --> 03:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
who struck John issue you've got to just
 
03:25:46.990 --> 03:25:47.000 align:start position:0%
move very quickly and I believe that
 
03:25:50.110 --> 03:25:50.120 align:start position:0%
what you just said seemed to contradict
 
03:25:50.120 --> 03:25:51.870 align:start position:0%
what you just said seemed to contradict
that

03:25:51.870 --> 03:25:51.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:25:54.309 --> 03:25:54.319 align:start position:0%
um there is an exception and it does
 
03:25:57.469 --> 03:25:57.479 align:start position:0%
apply to State Police it's D on page two
 
03:26:00.870 --> 03:26:00.880 align:start position:0%
line 8 for an emergency so the police
 
03:26:02.349 --> 03:26:02.359 align:start position:0%
could clearly get this in the case of
 
03:26:04.070 --> 03:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
emergency but where it's not an
 
03:26:05.269 --> 03:26:05.279 align:start position:0%
emergency where the police are
 
03:26:08.870 --> 03:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
investigating something then um the
 
03:26:14.150 --> 03:26:14.160 align:start position:0%
provisions of 522 would require them to
 
03:26:16.590 --> 03:26:16.600 align:start position:0%
give would not allow them to get
 
03:26:19.389 --> 03:26:19.399 align:start position:0%
subpoena whereas they can get a subpoena
 
03:26:21.950 --> 03:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
in 195 so you might want to consider
 
03:26:24.469 --> 03:26:24.479 align:start position:0%
taking the subpoena language from 195
 
03:26:28.110 --> 03:26:28.120 align:start position:0%
and putting it into 522 so the police
 
03:26:30.229 --> 03:26:30.239 align:start position:0%
can use a subpoena in appropriate
 
03:26:30.239 --> 03:26:31.590 align:start position:0%
can use a subpoena in appropriate
investigatory

03:26:31.590 --> 03:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
investigatory
 
03:26:33.990 --> 03:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
cases well thank you very much we're
 
03:26:35.269 --> 03:26:35.279 align:start position:0%
more concerned with the other we're
 
03:26:36.950 --> 03:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
concerned with situations in which there
 
03:26:39.910 --> 03:26:39.920 align:start position:0%
just isn't time the that clearly is
 
03:26:42.670 --> 03:26:42.680 align:start position:0%
covered by 522k not just for the police
 
03:26:45.830 --> 03:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
but for any state agency thank you are
 
03:26:48.309 --> 03:26:48.319 align:start position:0%
there any other questions seeing none
 
03:26:53.229 --> 03:26:53.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:27.030 --> 03:27:27.040 align:start position:0%

03:28:26.790 --> 03:28:26.800 align:start position:0%
bills we are respectfully um opposed to
 
03:28:29.630 --> 03:28:29.640 align:start position:0%
House Bill 22 and our concern is
 
03:28:32.630 --> 03:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
actually quite narrow um and pertains to
 
03:28:35.990 --> 03:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
section one only um and specifically uh
 
03:28:38.269 --> 03:28:38.279 align:start position:0%
proposed RSA
 
03:28:43.389 --> 03:28:43.399 align:start position:0%
507-i 2 um Roman 3 subsection e on page
 
03:28:46.790 --> 03:28:46.800 align:start position:0%
two starting on line 12 um and that's
 
03:28:49.349 --> 03:28:49.359 align:start position:0%
related to the condition that personal
 
03:28:51.830 --> 03:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
information be quote requested of and
 
03:28:54.070 --> 03:28:54.080 align:start position:0%
supplied by a third-party provider of
 
03:28:56.710 --> 03:28:56.720 align:start position:0%
information and services for named
 
03:28:59.630 --> 03:28:59.640 align:start position:0%
individuals Only We believe that that
 
03:29:01.830 --> 03:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
current language um would prevent the
 
03:29:03.950 --> 03:29:03.960 align:start position:0%
continued operation of community power
 
03:29:05.990 --> 03:29:06.000 align:start position:0%

and information um we believe that
 
03:29:53.349 --> 03:29:53.359 align:start position:0%
existing law provides uh that in order
 
03:29:55.630 --> 03:29:55.640 align:start position:0%
to launch new community power programs
 
03:29:57.790 --> 03:29:57.800 align:start position:0%

03:30:07.590 --> 03:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
as third parties to provide us with this
 
03:30:10.150 --> 03:30:10.160 align:start position:0%
data for all individuals which includes
 
03:30:12.349 --> 03:30:12.359 align:start position:0%
personal information as defined in
 
03:30:14.670 --> 03:30:14.680 align:start position:0%
section one of the bill this data is
 
03:30:17.429 --> 03:30:17.439 align:start position:0%
needed since we are required um by the
 
03:30:20.790 --> 03:30:20.800 align:start position:0%
community power aggregation act or RSA
 
03:30:24.630 --> 03:30:24.640 align:start position:0%
53- col 7 to mail written notification
 
03:30:27.229 --> 03:30:27.239 align:start position:0%
to each retail Electric customer within
 
03:30:30.070 --> 03:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
the municipality or County service area
 
03:30:32.389 --> 03:30:32.399 align:start position:0%
where the community power program is
 
03:30:34.870 --> 03:30:34.880 align:start position:0%
provided if we do not have the ability
 
03:30:37.229 --> 03:30:37.239 align:start position:0%
to receive this data from the utilities
 
03:30:39.750 --> 03:30:39.760 align:start position:0%
there is no way for us to know specific
 
03:30:42.469 --> 03:30:42.479 align:start position:0%
named individuals which is the approach
 
03:30:46.309 --> 03:30:46.319 align:start position:0%
proposed via subsection e um all that
 
03:30:47.750 --> 03:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
being said we think that there's a
 
03:30:50.070 --> 03:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
relatively simple solution to address
 
03:30:52.950 --> 03:30:52.960 align:start position:0%
our concern and that is to remove the
 
03:30:55.710 --> 03:30:55.720 align:start position:0%
provided that condition um of SE
 
03:30:59.030 --> 03:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
subsection e which is on page two lines
 
03:31:03.790 --> 03:31:03.800 align:start position:0%
12- 16 um and as shown on page four of
 
03:31:07.150 --> 03:31:07.160 align:start position:0%
my written testimony um so sub what
 
03:31:09.670 --> 03:31:09.680 align:start position:0%
we're proposing is that subsection e
 
03:31:12.630 --> 03:31:12.640 align:start position:0%
would simply read as the follows as the
 
03:31:15.110 --> 03:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
follow cases where the acquisition
 
03:31:16.950 --> 03:31:16.960 align:start position:0%
collection ret attention or use of
 
03:31:19.150 --> 03:31:19.160 align:start position:0%
personal information is authorized or
 
03:31:21.990 --> 03:31:22.000 align:start position:0%
required by state or federal law period
 
03:31:24.830 --> 03:31:24.840 align:start position:0%
and the remainder of lines 13 through 16
 
03:31:25.950 --> 03:31:25.960 align:start position:0%
would be
 
03:31:28.070 --> 03:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
removed um so with that thank you for
 
03:31:30.110 --> 03:31:30.120 align:start position:0%
your time and consideration of my
 
03:31:33.189 --> 03:31:33.199 align:start position:0%
testimony I welcome any questions are
 
03:31:34.309 --> 03:31:34.319 align:start position:0%
there any
 
03:31:37.830 --> 03:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank

03:31:52.870 --> 03:31:52.880 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is Warren Cormac
 
03:31:55.229 --> 03:31:55.239 align:start position:0%
I'm the Assistant Attorney General uh in
 
03:31:57.030 --> 03:31:57.040 align:start position:0%
charge of data privacy enforcement in
 
03:31:58.630 --> 03:31:58.640 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Department of Justice
 
03:32:00.469 --> 03:32:00.479 align:start position:0%
consumer protection and antitrust
 
03:32:02.550 --> 03:32:02.560 align:start position:0%
Bureau the Attorney General doesn't take
 
03:32:05.110 --> 03:32:05.120 align:start position:0%
a position on this bill I testify to
 
03:32:06.550 --> 03:32:06.560 align:start position:0%
raise an issue with a language that
 
03:32:08.950 --> 03:32:08.960 align:start position:0%
might result in unintended
 
03:32:10.790 --> 03:32:10.800 align:start position:0%
consequences the Department of Justice
 
03:32:13.309 --> 03:32:13.319 align:start position:0%
is a law enforcement agency and this
 
03:32:15.309 --> 03:32:15.319 align:start position:0%
bill applies to Regulatory and
 
03:32:17.389 --> 03:32:17.399 align:start position:0%
administrative agencies but not law
 
03:32:17.399 --> 03:32:18.590 align:start position:0%
administrative agencies but not law
enforcement

03:32:18.590 --> 03:32:18.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
03:32:21.229 --> 03:32:21.239 align:start position:0%
agencies however uh the consumer
 
03:32:22.590 --> 03:32:22.600 align:start position:0%
protection and antitrust Bureau
 
03:32:24.349 --> 03:32:24.359 align:start position:0%
regularly receives substantial amounts
 
03:32:26.429 --> 03:32:26.439 align:start position:0%
of data uh
 
03:32:29.790 --> 03:32:29.800 align:start position:0%
from providers from entities uh after
 
03:32:32.070 --> 03:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
issuance of an administrative subpoena
 
03:32:38.150 --> 03:32:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:40.429 --> 03:32:40.439 align:start position:0%
Authority and these subpoenas are
 
03:32:41.870 --> 03:32:41.880 align:start position:0%
regularly issued against financial
 
03:32:43.750 --> 03:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
institutions covered by this
 
03:32:47.389 --> 03:32:47.399 align:start position:0%
bill and it's a core part of the
 
03:32:49.670 --> 03:32:49.680 align:start position:0%
investigations of a lot of what the
 
03:32:51.469 --> 03:32:51.479 align:start position:0%
consumer protection and antitrust Bureau
 
03:32:54.229 --> 03:32:54.239 align:start position:0%
does like for example investigating
 
03:32:55.910 --> 03:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
violations of the consumer protection
 
03:32:58.670 --> 03:32:58.680 align:start position:0%
act with respect to uh home contractors
 
03:33:00.150 --> 03:33:00.160 align:start position:0%
oftentimes an administrative subpoena
 
03:33:02.189 --> 03:33:02.199 align:start position:0%
would be issued to a bank uh to look
 
03:33:06.110 --> 03:33:06.120 align:start position:0%
into the books of that type of a
 
03:33:08.429 --> 03:33:08.439 align:start position:0%
situation so because this bill could
 
03:33:09.830 --> 03:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
inhibit the ability of the consumer
 
03:33:11.309 --> 03:33:11.319 align:start position:0%
protection and antitrust Bureau to
 
03:33:14.429 --> 03:33:14.439 align:start position:0%
engage in consumer protection
 
03:33:16.830 --> 03:33:16.840 align:start position:0%
investigations the suggestion is that
 
03:33:19.269 --> 03:33:19.279 align:start position:0%
law enforcement agencies be added to the
 
03:33:21.150 --> 03:33:21.160 align:start position:0%
list of regulatory and administrative
 
03:33:26.670 --> 03:33:26.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:30.349 --> 03:33:30.359 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you any
 
03:33:33.870 --> 03:33:33.880 align:start position:0%

afternoon everyone colleagues uh for the
 
04:02:47.309 --> 04:02:47.319 align:start position:0%
record I am representative Greg Hill a
 
04:02:50.110 --> 04:02:50.120 align:start position:0%
chair legislative Administration and I'm
 
04:02:54.590 --> 04:02:54.600 align:start position:0%
here to introduce house uh hdr1 for
 
04:02:54.600 --> 04:02:57.670 align:start position:0%
here to introduce house uh hdr1 for
short

04:02:57.670 --> 04:02:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:01.590 --> 04:03:01.600 align:start position:0%
um I uh will be here to explain why I
 
04:03:04.590 --> 04:03:04.600 align:start position:0%
filed the red resolution and what it
 
04:03:07.269 --> 04:03:07.279 align:start position:0%
does I should begin by saying this is
 
04:03:09.510 --> 04:03:09.520 align:start position:0%
not the first time this exact reg
 
04:03:13.750 --> 04:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
resolution was filed in 2003 the resolu
 
04:03:18.790 --> 04:03:18.800 align:start position:0%
ution passed the house 213 to 142 and
 
04:03:21.590 --> 04:03:21.600 align:start position:0%
died in the Senate I read the entire
 
04:03:24.830 --> 04:03:24.840 align:start position:0%
file including the testimony submitted I
 
04:03:26.670 --> 04:03:26.680 align:start position:0%
believe the reason some members of the
 
04:03:28.830 --> 04:03:28.840 align:start position:0%
Senate chose to let it die was a feeling
 
04:03:31.070 --> 04:03:31.080 align:start position:0%
that they didn't want to embarrass the
 
04:03:35.110 --> 04:03:35.120 align:start position:0%
court from the testimony I read it seems
 
04:03:38.070 --> 04:03:38.080 align:start position:0%
clear though that most of the
 
04:03:42.229 --> 04:03:42.239 align:start position:0%
justices um or most of the testimony uh
 
04:03:45.269 --> 04:03:45.279 align:start position:0%
felt that the Claremont ision had laid a
 
04:03:45.279 --> 04:03:46.670 align:start position:0%
felt that the Claremont ision had laid a
proverbial

04:03:46.670 --> 04:03:46.680 align:start position:0%
proverbial
 
04:03:49.990 --> 04:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
egg in cander I should also
 
04:03:52.830 --> 04:03:52.840 align:start position:0%
explain that much of my testimony here
 
04:03:55.830 --> 04:03:55.840 align:start position:0%
today was stolen from that 2003
 
04:03:58.750 --> 04:03:58.760 align:start position:0%
historical record for I too believe the
 
04:04:01.670 --> 04:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
Claremont decision was wrongly
 
04:04:04.110 --> 04:04:04.120 align:start position:0%
decided with that as a backdrop let me
 
04:04:06.910 --> 04:04:06.920 align:start position:0%
say the purpose of this resolution is to
 
04:04:09.469 --> 04:04:09.479 align:start position:0%
make it clear that we the House and
 
04:04:11.950 --> 04:04:11.960 align:start position:0%
Senate find the lines of responsibility
 
04:04:14.389 --> 04:04:14.399 align:start position:0%
between the judicial and legislative
 
04:04:16.710 --> 04:04:16.720 align:start position:0%
branches to have been crossed in the
 
04:04:19.910 --> 04:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
1993 Claremont foundational
 
04:04:22.550 --> 04:04:22.560 align:start position:0%
decision all subsequent Claremont
 
04:04:24.670 --> 04:04:24.680 align:start position:0%
decisions but most especially the
 
04:04:27.710 --> 04:04:27.720 align:start position:0%
current conil decision lawsuit have
 
04:04:30.229 --> 04:04:30.239 align:start position:0%
doubled down on that original Crossing
 
04:04:33.229 --> 04:04:33.239 align:start position:0%
of lines of separation between
 
04:04:37.710 --> 04:04:37.720 align:start position:0%
branches hcr1 is needed now as a measure
 
04:04:40.149 --> 04:04:40.159 align:start position:0%
of our resolve to defend our sworn
 
04:04:42.550 --> 04:04:42.560 align:start position:0%
constitutional responsibilities now and
 
04:04:44.710 --> 04:04:44.720 align:start position:0%
in the future
 
04:04:46.710 --> 04:04:46.720 align:start position:0%
our system of government is based on the
 
04:04:48.830 --> 04:04:48.840 align:start position:0%
system of check our our form of
 
04:04:50.469 --> 04:04:50.479 align:start position:0%
government is based on the system of
 
04:04:53.229 --> 04:04:53.239 align:start position:0%
checks and balances one of these checks
 
04:04:56.030 --> 04:04:56.040 align:start position:0%
and balances is the separation of powers
 
04:04:59.750 --> 04:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
among the three branches hcr1 does not
 
04:05:03.070 --> 04:05:03.080 align:start position:0%
reject the theory of judicial review it
 
04:05:06.110 --> 04:05:06.120 align:start position:0%
does not assert that the legislature or
 
04:05:07.710 --> 04:05:07.720 align:start position:0%
the governor can
 
04:05:10.510 --> 04:05:10.520 align:start position:0%
overrule Court decisions or even that
 
04:05:12.750 --> 04:05:12.760 align:start position:0%
courts cannot review legislation
 
04:05:15.110 --> 04:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
affecting educ or tax
 
04:05:19.550 --> 04:05:19.560 align:start position:0%
policy rather hcr1 simply affirms the
 
04:05:21.790 --> 04:05:21.800 align:start position:0%
well settled proposition that the power
 
04:05:24.950 --> 04:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
of judicial review is not the power to
 
04:05:27.110 --> 04:05:27.120 align:start position:0%
direct the other branches to pass
 
04:05:30.070 --> 04:05:30.080 align:start position:0%
legislation and that consequently by the
 
04:05:32.830 --> 04:05:32.840 align:start position:0%
directives of the Supreme Court in the
 
04:05:35.070 --> 04:05:35.080 align:start position:0%
Claremont decisions that the legislature
 
04:05:37.510 --> 04:05:37.520 align:start position:0%
is required to pass certain legislation
 
04:05:40.110 --> 04:05:40.120 align:start position:0%
based on parameters set forth by the
 
04:05:42.950 --> 04:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
court in other words these are not
 
04:05:45.269 --> 04:05:45.279 align:start position:0%
binding upon the
 
04:05:47.590 --> 04:05:47.600 align:start position:0%
legislature as we took office we all
 
04:05:49.269 --> 04:05:49.279 align:start position:0%
swore an oath to protect our
 
04:05:51.590 --> 04:05:51.600 align:start position:0%
constitution I'll assume you have read
 
04:05:53.349 --> 04:05:53.359 align:start position:0%
and have an understanding of both parts
 
04:05:56.189 --> 04:05:56.199 align:start position:0%
of our constitution part first is the
 
04:05:58.790 --> 04:05:58.800 align:start position:0%
Bill of Rights part second is the form
 
04:06:02.070 --> 04:06:02.080 align:start position:0%
of government one of the many flaws of
 
04:06:05.269 --> 04:06:05.279 align:start position:0%
the Claremont decision was the justices
 
04:06:08.149 --> 04:06:08.159 align:start position:0%
finding the word cherish in article 83
 
04:06:11.630 --> 04:06:11.640 align:start position:0%
of part two the form of government
 
04:06:14.550 --> 04:06:14.560 align:start position:0%
section and succeeding in all sort of
 
04:06:16.870 --> 04:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
mental gymnastics to turn that into a
 
04:06:19.469 --> 04:06:19.479 align:start position:0%
right a right suitable for the first
 
04:06:21.429 --> 04:06:21.439 align:start position:0%
part of the
 
04:06:23.429 --> 04:06:23.439 align:start position:0%
Constitution if you believe in the
 
04:06:26.710 --> 04:06:26.720 align:start position:0%
Constitution and I think we all do then
 
04:06:29.309 --> 04:06:29.319 align:start position:0%
you know precise words and placement
 
04:06:31.750 --> 04:06:31.760 align:start position:0%
matter those at the Constitutional
 
04:06:34.229 --> 04:06:34.239 align:start position:0%
Convention in the n in the 1850s
 
04:06:36.030 --> 04:06:36.040 align:start position:0%
understood that well and tried
 
04:06:37.910 --> 04:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
unsuccessfully to put the words of
 
04:06:41.189 --> 04:06:41.199 align:start position:0%
article 83 dealing with school funding
 
04:06:44.110 --> 04:06:44.120 align:start position:0%
into part one by resolution
 
04:06:45.990 --> 04:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
that resolution
 
04:06:48.990 --> 04:06:49.000 align:start position:0%
failed words matter and placement
 
04:06:52.750 --> 04:06:52.760 align:start position:0%
matters our framers changed a word from
 
04:06:54.429 --> 04:06:54.439 align:start position:0%
the Massachusetts
 
04:06:57.229 --> 04:06:57.239 align:start position:0%
Constitution that we used as a template
 
04:06:59.469 --> 04:06:59.479 align:start position:0%
when creating our New Hampshire
 
04:07:02.149 --> 04:07:02.159 align:start position:0%
Constitution I've given you copies of
 
04:07:04.910 --> 04:07:04.920 align:start position:0%
both to highlight the significant change
 
04:07:08.990 --> 04:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
that was made the word legislature was
 
04:07:10.990 --> 04:07:11.000 align:start position:0%
changed to
 
04:07:14.110 --> 04:07:14.120 align:start position:0%
legislator in our ratified constit
 
04:07:17.510 --> 04:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
stion the framers it seems wanted the
 
04:07:19.750 --> 04:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
individual legislators to cherish
 
04:07:22.790 --> 04:07:22.800 align:start position:0%
education not the entire
 
04:07:25.670 --> 04:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
legislature words have meaning and I
 
04:07:28.149 --> 04:07:28.159 align:start position:0%
believe the justice and the trial court
 
04:07:30.429 --> 04:07:30.439 align:start position:0%
who first heard the claron testimony
 
04:07:34.670 --> 04:07:34.680 align:start position:0%
understood that I've given you an
 
04:07:37.870 --> 04:07:37.880 align:start position:0%
excerpt typo except um it should be
 
04:07:39.990 --> 04:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
excerpt of his decision that was
 
04:07:45.590 --> 04:07:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:45.600 --> 04:07:48.030 align:start position:0%
 
page

04:07:48.030 --> 04:07:48.040 align:start position:0%
page
 
04:07:51.429 --> 04:07:51.439 align:start position:0%
three and it
 
04:07:53.950 --> 04:07:53.960 align:start position:0%
says New Hampshire's encouragement of
 
04:07:56.469 --> 04:07:56.479 align:start position:0%
literature Clause contains no language
 
04:07:59.469 --> 04:07:59.479 align:start position:0%
regarding Equity uniformity or even
 
04:08:01.070 --> 04:08:01.080 align:start position:0%
adequacy of
 
04:08:03.269 --> 04:08:03.279 align:start position:0%
Education thus the New Hampshire
 
04:08:06.109 --> 04:08:06.119 align:start position:0%
Constitution imposes no qualitative
 
04:08:09.790 --> 04:08:09.800 align:start position:0%
standard of Education which must be met
 
04:08:11.790 --> 04:08:11.800 align:start position:0%
likewise the New Hampshire Constitution
 
04:08:14.870 --> 04:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
imposes no quantifiable Financial Duty
 
04:08:17.429 --> 04:08:17.439 align:start position:0%
regarding education there is no mention
 
04:08:20.229 --> 04:08:20.239 align:start position:0%
of funding or even of providing or
 
04:08:23.830 --> 04:08:23.840 align:start position:0%
maintaining education the only duty set
 
04:08:27.109 --> 04:08:27.119 align:start position:0%
forth is the amorphous duty to cherish
 
04:08:29.870 --> 04:08:29.880 align:start position:0%
public schools and to encourage private
 
04:08:31.189 --> 04:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
and public
 
04:08:33.750 --> 04:08:33.760 align:start position:0%
institutions the language of part two
 
04:08:43.830 --> 04:08:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:46.590 --> 04:08:46.600 align:start position:0%
this decision is not often me mentioned
 
04:08:48.269 --> 04:08:48.279 align:start position:0%
by those who feel the Claremont
 
04:08:51.429 --> 04:08:51.439 align:start position:0%
decisions represent gospel neither are
 
04:08:53.550 --> 04:08:53.560 align:start position:0%
the words of Justice Horton who
 
04:08:56.550 --> 04:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
dissented in Claremont 2 but I have
 
04:08:58.550 --> 04:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
given you an excerpt of that dissent as
 
04:09:01.990 --> 04:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
well he said my problem is that I was
 
04:09:04.990 --> 04:09:05.000 align:start position:0%
not appointed to establish education po
 
04:09:07.710 --> 04:09:07.720 align:start position:0%
policy nor to determine the proper way
 
04:09:10.269 --> 04:09:10.279 align:start position:0%
to finance the implementation of this
 
04:09:13.510 --> 04:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
policy those duties in my opinion reside
 
04:09:16.189 --> 04:09:16.199 align:start position:0%
with the representatives of the people
 
04:09:18.710 --> 04:09:18.720 align:start position:0%
my job is to determine whether the
 
04:09:21.149 --> 04:09:21.159 align:start position:0%
structures for providing and financing
 
04:09:24.990 --> 04:09:25.000 align:start position:0%
education meet the mandates of the
 
04:09:27.750 --> 04:09:27.760 align:start position:0%
Constitution the original drafters of
 
04:09:33.109 --> 04:09:33.119 align:start position:0%
hcr1 14 from 2003 proclaimed and I agree
 
04:09:34.950 --> 04:09:34.960 align:start position:0%
that what the drafters of the Claremont
 
04:09:38.149 --> 04:09:38.159 align:start position:0%
decisions did was to claim innocence in
 
04:09:40.309 --> 04:09:40.319 align:start position:0%
words but crossed the Constitutional
 
04:09:43.910 --> 04:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
lines in action the legislature and not
 
04:09:45.910 --> 04:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
the courts were given the exclusive
 
04:09:48.710 --> 04:09:48.720 align:start position:0%
right to make laws and spend money I've
 
04:09:51.429 --> 04:09:51.439 align:start position:0%
given you a copy of part two Article 5
 
04:09:54.830 --> 04:09:54.840 align:start position:0%
in this package that clearly says just
 
04:09:57.870 --> 04:09:57.880 align:start position:0%
that and so while the courts say it is
 
04:09:59.790 --> 04:09:59.800 align:start position:0%
up to the legislature to
 
04:10:02.990 --> 04:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
define adequacy a word The Claremont
 
04:10:04.830 --> 04:10:04.840 align:start position:0%
Court made up by the
 
04:10:08.269 --> 04:10:08.279 align:start position:0%
way and devise a scheme to provide State
 
04:10:11.790 --> 04:10:11.800 align:start position:0%
funding by right by dismissing every
 
04:10:14.469 --> 04:10:14.479 align:start position:0%
single attempt by the legisl to do that
 
04:10:16.870 --> 04:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
they have effectively broken the intent
 
04:10:19.070 --> 04:10:19.080 align:start position:0%
of the Constitution that allows the
 
04:10:23.790 --> 04:10:23.800 align:start position:0%
legislature to make laws and spend money
 
04:10:26.910 --> 04:10:26.920 align:start position:0%
exclusively this HCR makes clear that I
 
04:10:29.030 --> 04:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
wish the legis what I wish the
 
04:10:31.070 --> 04:10:31.080 align:start position:0%
legislature had done in
 
04:10:35.030 --> 04:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
1993 say clearly and loudly thank you
 
04:10:37.149 --> 04:10:37.159 align:start position:0%
justices for your hard work and opinion
 
04:10:39.229 --> 04:10:39.239 align:start position:0%
on this matter but our reading of the
 
04:10:42.269 --> 04:10:42.279 align:start position:0%
Constitution counts as well and we'll
 
04:10:45.429 --> 04:10:45.439 align:start position:0%
act as we see bit after all we are
 
04:10:47.990 --> 04:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
elected by and represent the people of
 
04:10:48.000 --> 04:10:48.790 align:start position:0%
elected by and represent the people of
New

04:10:48.790 --> 04:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
New
 
04:10:50.870 --> 04:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire with that I'll end my
 
04:10:53.510 --> 04:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
testimony um and ask for you to do
 
04:10:55.750 --> 04:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
nothing other than your sworn Duty
 
04:10:57.790 --> 04:10:57.800 align:start position:0%
regarding our Constitution and protect
 
04:10:59.830 --> 04:10:59.840 align:start position:0%
the separation of
 
04:11:02.550 --> 04:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
powers I understand there's a number of
 
04:11:05.309 --> 04:11:05.319 align:start position:0%
people speaking and I would limit um any
 
04:11:08.070 --> 04:11:08.080 align:start position:0%
questions to one or two uh Mr chairman
 
04:11:10.309 --> 04:11:10.319 align:start position:0%
thank you very much questions for this
 
04:11:12.830 --> 04:11:12.840 align:start position:0%
witness representative Perez thank you
 
04:11:15.429 --> 04:11:15.439 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my
 
04:11:18.910 --> 04:11:18.920 align:start position:0%
question has this come up before last
 
04:11:21.790 --> 04:11:21.800 align:start position:0%
year when it came up the issue
 
04:11:25.109 --> 04:11:25.119 align:start position:0%
about um the issue about the
 
04:11:28.229 --> 04:11:28.239 align:start position:0%
Claremont um The Claremont decision I
 
04:11:29.950 --> 04:11:29.960 align:start position:0%
mean it's been since
 
04:11:32.910 --> 04:11:32.920 align:start position:0%
1993 so it's been quite a while has it
 
04:11:37.510 --> 04:11:37.520 align:start position:0%
come up in the past that this is to our
 
04:11:40.229 --> 04:11:40.239 align:start position:0%
legislated government I think it's fair
 
04:11:42.429 --> 04:11:42.439 align:start position:0%
to say there's uh quite a few people
 
04:11:44.710 --> 04:11:44.720 align:start position:0%
here that thank you for your question
 
04:11:50.590 --> 04:11:50.600 align:start position:0%
that are um clared out um I think uh
 
04:11:53.790 --> 04:11:53.800 align:start position:0%
there's been a significant number of of
 
04:11:56.070 --> 04:11:56.080 align:start position:0%
pieces of legislation U that have come
 
04:11:58.590 --> 04:11:58.600 align:start position:0%
before this committee as well as others
 
04:12:01.790 --> 04:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
um not to mention um you know I think
 
04:12:03.790 --> 04:12:03.800 align:start position:0%
we're maybe up to Claremont eight or
 
04:12:07.630 --> 04:12:07.640 align:start position:0%
nine within the uh within the Judiciary
 
04:12:11.510 --> 04:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
itself followup
 
04:12:14.630 --> 04:12:14.640 align:start position:0%
yes does this have anything to do with
 
04:12:17.990 --> 04:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
the fact that we have the um education
 
04:12:21.590 --> 04:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
funding court case right now that's
 
04:12:25.309 --> 04:12:25.319 align:start position:0%
pending um in the courts or in our oh in
 
04:12:29.030 --> 04:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
the courts um it does only in the
 
04:12:31.229 --> 04:12:31.239 align:start position:0%
standpoint of what I said in my
 
04:12:35.630 --> 04:12:35.640 align:start position:0%
testimony that um each time a
 
04:12:39.750 --> 04:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
new um set of of uh plaintiffs come
 
04:12:43.710 --> 04:12:43.720 align:start position:0%
before the court it seems um the
 
04:12:47.030 --> 04:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
Judiciary has gone even one step further
 
04:12:50.510 --> 04:12:50.520 align:start position:0%
in as I said doubling down on uh this
 
04:12:53.229 --> 04:12:53.239 align:start position:0%
separation of powers
 
04:12:57.750 --> 04:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
um what I'm trying to avoid here um or
 
04:12:59.910 --> 04:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
and part part of the reason for filing
 
04:13:03.309 --> 04:13:03.319 align:start position:0%
this resolution is I don't see an end to
 
04:13:07.830 --> 04:13:07.840 align:start position:0%
these um it seems that every time a a
 
04:13:11.469 --> 04:13:11.479 align:start position:0%
case comes before the court um the
 
04:13:15.349 --> 04:13:15.359 align:start position:0%
legislature tries to do something to um
 
04:13:19.950 --> 04:13:19.960 align:start position:0%
appease that decision and it lasts for a
 
04:13:22.389 --> 04:13:22.399 align:start position:0%
year or two and then another court case
 
04:13:25.070 --> 04:13:25.080 align:start position:0%
comes I don't see anything in this
 
04:13:29.269 --> 04:13:29.279 align:start position:0%
existing one this conval case um that's
 
04:13:32.790 --> 04:13:32.800 align:start position:0%
going to be the the end all case um I
 
04:13:38.469 --> 04:13:38.479 align:start position:0%
think we are facing a NeverEnding supply
 
04:13:43.670 --> 04:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
of um of um plaintiffs um and and
 
04:13:46.109 --> 04:13:46.119 align:start position:0%
defendants um and that's what I'm trying
 
04:13:50.910 --> 04:13:50.920 align:start position:0%
to avoid this endless supply of of cases
 
04:13:53.109 --> 04:13:53.119 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you other questions for
 
04:13:55.710 --> 04:13:55.720 align:start position:0%
this witness seeing none thank you very
 
04:13:57.870 --> 04:13:57.880 align:start position:0%

I'm going to call on representative Pam
Brown

04:14:08.429 --> 04:14:08.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:11.670 --> 04:14:11.680 align:start position:0%
please good afternoon committee members
 
04:14:14.349 --> 04:14:14.359 align:start position:0%
and Mr chairman
 
04:14:16.269 --> 04:14:16.279 align:start position:0%
for the record I'm representative Pam
 
04:14:17.990 --> 04:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
Brown from the towns of Kingston and
 
04:14:20.429 --> 04:14:20.439 align:start position:0%
East Kingston and I also clerk on the
 
04:14:23.109 --> 04:14:23.119 align:start position:0%
house education funding committee I'm an
 
04:14:25.790 --> 04:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
economist and a college professor I here
 
04:14:28.590 --> 04:14:28.600 align:start position:0%
to express my very strong support for
 
04:14:31.389 --> 04:14:31.399 align:start position:0%
hcr1 on our two education committees
 
04:14:33.790 --> 04:14:33.800 align:start position:0%
policy and funding we've been actively
 
04:14:35.910 --> 04:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
working to to address and more clearly
 
04:14:38.229 --> 04:14:38.239 align:start position:0%
Define two Central issues the
 
04:14:39.830 --> 04:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
appropriate scope of subjects to be
 
04:14:41.750 --> 04:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
covered in New Hampshire schools and the
 
04:14:44.070 --> 04:14:44.080 align:start position:0%
appropriate level and method of funding
 
04:14:46.990 --> 04:14:47.000 align:start position:0%
Education Services in New Hampshire we
 
04:14:48.590 --> 04:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
are well aware of the continued
 
04:14:50.550 --> 04:14:50.560 align:start position:0%
deliberations regarding these issues in
 
04:14:50.560 --> 04:14:51.790 align:start position:0%
deliberations regarding these issues in
our

04:14:51.790 --> 04:14:51.800 align:start position:0%
our
 
04:14:54.349 --> 04:14:54.359 align:start position:0%
courts I'm left wondering why the
 
04:14:56.670 --> 04:14:56.680 align:start position:0%
judicial branch has become activist
 
04:14:59.070 --> 04:14:59.080 align:start position:0%
concerning these matters and how they
 
04:15:01.149 --> 04:15:01.159 align:start position:0%
have reached what appear to be arbitrary
 
04:15:04.109 --> 04:15:04.119 align:start position:0%
political decisions regarding article 83
 
04:15:04.119 --> 04:15:05.189 align:start position:0%
political decisions regarding article 83
for

04:15:05.189 --> 04:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:15:07.349 --> 04:15:07.359 align:start position:0%
example I've scoured several
 
04:15:10.710 --> 04:15:10.720 align:start position:0%
dictionaries and the aorai none of them
 
04:15:13.189 --> 04:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
indicates a close synonym for cherish is
 
04:15:15.309 --> 04:15:15.319 align:start position:0%
to fund or
 
04:15:19.510 --> 04:15:19.520 align:start position:0%
Finance in 1784 when article 83 was
 
04:15:21.950 --> 04:15:21.960 align:start position:0%
established I believe the average school
 
04:15:24.030 --> 04:15:24.040 align:start position:0%
had at most six or seven
 
04:15:26.630 --> 04:15:26.640 align:start position:0%
grades what is the exact scope of
 
04:15:30.229 --> 04:15:30.239 align:start position:0%
Education levels to be financed the
 
04:15:33.109 --> 04:15:33.119 align:start position:0%
court seems to assume K to 12 but but
 
04:15:36.910 --> 04:15:36.920 align:start position:0%
why not grades uh 1 through
 
04:15:39.750 --> 04:15:39.760 align:start position:0%
8 when basic reading and computational
 
04:15:41.910 --> 04:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
skills are nailed down or K through
 
04:15:45.229 --> 04:15:45.239 align:start position:0%
Community College or K through grad
 
04:15:47.830 --> 04:15:47.840 align:start position:0%
school finally estimates of adequate
 
04:15:49.990 --> 04:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
Education costs are tied to debatable
 
04:15:52.189 --> 04:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
metrics measuring
 
04:15:54.750 --> 04:15:54.760 align:start position:0%
success in the New Hampshire 2020
 
04:15:57.630 --> 04:15:57.640 align:start position:0%
commission report it indicates that
 
04:15:59.550 --> 04:15:59.560 align:start position:0%
increased School attendance is an
 
04:16:01.510 --> 04:16:01.520 align:start position:0%
evidence-based measure of
 
04:16:04.990 --> 04:16:05.000 align:start position:0%
success attendance is an input not an
 
04:16:07.750 --> 04:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
output such as assessment
 
04:16:11.269 --> 04:16:11.279 align:start position:0%
results so in short New Hampshire's
 
04:16:14.630 --> 04:16:14.640 align:start position:0%
education cake is isn't Half Baked at
 
04:16:16.510 --> 04:16:16.520 align:start position:0%
this point all of the ingredients
 
04:16:17.790 --> 04:16:17.800 align:start position:0%
haven't been
 
04:16:20.189 --> 04:16:20.199 align:start position:0%
assembled these are legislative matters
 
04:16:22.309 --> 04:16:22.319 align:start position:0%
and not judicial I'll continue to watch
 
04:16:26.109 --> 04:16:26.119 align:start position:0%
the Court's decisions and activities but
 
04:16:28.389 --> 04:16:28.399 align:start position:0%
we're also going to be doing our work
 
04:16:32.149 --> 04:16:32.159 align:start position:0%
thank you questions for this witness
 
04:16:34.630 --> 04:16:34.640 align:start position:0%
representative Perez sorry thank you
 
04:16:38.149 --> 04:16:38.159 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um
 
04:16:41.710 --> 04:16:41.720 align:start position:0%
perception okay I have a concern and
 
04:16:45.349 --> 04:16:45.359 align:start position:0%
trust me I'm a big constitutional person
 
04:16:49.070 --> 04:16:49.080 align:start position:0%
but I have a concern about if they say
 
04:16:50.990 --> 04:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
we should do something and we don't do
 
04:16:52.950 --> 04:16:52.960 align:start position:0%
that what is the perception to our
 
04:16:56.550 --> 04:16:56.560 align:start position:0%
constituents do you see any issue if uh
 
04:16:58.550 --> 04:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
the courts come back and say we need to
 
04:17:01.590 --> 04:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
increase funding for example to all the
 
04:17:04.149 --> 04:17:04.159 align:start position:0%
schools all the public schools and we
 
04:17:07.389 --> 04:17:07.399 align:start position:0%
say well we don't have to do that do you
 
04:17:09.349 --> 04:17:09.359 align:start position:0%
see an issue with what the perception on
 
04:17:12.990 --> 04:17:13.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:15.070 --> 04:17:15.080 align:start position:0%
I think the biggest problem is that the
 
04:17:17.630 --> 04:17:17.640 align:start position:0%
districts want local control of what
 
04:17:19.910 --> 04:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
they provide to their students and they
 
04:17:22.109 --> 04:17:22.119 align:start position:0%
may want to limit it to basic subject
 
04:17:24.070 --> 04:17:24.080 align:start position:0%
matter other school districts may want
 
04:17:26.630 --> 04:17:26.640 align:start position:0%
to have a swimming pool or tennis courts
 
04:17:28.510 --> 04:17:28.520 align:start position:0%
so when we look at the average cost of a
 
04:17:30.910 --> 04:17:30.920 align:start position:0%
student across districts we have to
 
04:17:32.550 --> 04:17:32.560 align:start position:0%
really drill down and look at what each
 
04:17:35.269 --> 04:17:35.279 align:start position:0%
district is doing for their students and
 
04:17:37.109 --> 04:17:37.119 align:start position:0%
some districts want to spend a lot with
 
04:17:38.870 --> 04:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
many bells and whistles and others
 
04:17:42.389 --> 04:17:42.399 align:start position:0%
prefer just to have the basic skills and
 
04:17:45.830 --> 04:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
Athletics and limit it to that so to me
 
04:17:48.830 --> 04:17:48.840 align:start position:0%
they really need to um allow the local
 
04:17:51.550 --> 04:17:51.560 align:start position:0%
districts to decide what particular
 
04:17:53.830 --> 04:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
Services they'd like to include in their
 
04:17:56.630 --> 04:17:56.640 align:start position:0%
budgets and by mandating an average cost
 
04:17:58.469 --> 04:17:58.479 align:start position:0%
of Education they're really overlooking
 
04:18:00.590 --> 04:18:00.600 align:start position:0%
all of these details and I to me that's
 
04:18:03.710 --> 04:18:03.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:07.030 --> 04:18:07.040 align:start position:0%
issue other questions for this witness
 
04:18:08.870 --> 04:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
04:18:11.030 --> 04:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
you so much next I'm going to call on
 
04:18:28.030 --> 04:18:28.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:30.189 --> 04:18:30.199 align:start position:0%
Rumble thank you Mr chairman and
 
04:18:31.990 --> 04:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
committee members my name is David
 
04:18:33.590 --> 04:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
Trumble I'm from the town of whereare I
 
04:18:36.950 --> 04:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill for a few reasons first
 
04:18:39.830 --> 04:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
the resolution I think leaves out half
 
04:18:41.710 --> 04:18:41.720 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire Constitution's
 
04:18:44.229 --> 04:18:44.239 align:start position:0%
article on separation of powers at the
 
04:18:45.830 --> 04:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
beginning of the resolution in the
 
04:18:47.950 --> 04:18:47.960 align:start position:0%
whereas section they mentioned the
 
04:18:50.030 --> 04:18:50.040 align:start position:0%
separate and independent branches of
 
04:18:52.109 --> 04:18:52.119 align:start position:0%
government but that's only half of the
 
04:18:55.189 --> 04:18:55.199 align:start position:0%
sentence in article 37 the second half
 
04:18:57.070 --> 04:18:57.080 align:start position:0%
of the sentence goes on to describe the
 
04:18:59.710 --> 04:18:59.720 align:start position:0%
three branches as having quote a chain
 
04:19:02.510 --> 04:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
of connection that binds the whole
 
04:19:04.950 --> 04:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
fabric of the Constitution into one
 
04:19:08.149 --> 04:19:08.159 align:start position:0%
dissoluble Bond of Union and Amity
 
04:19:10.269 --> 04:19:10.279 align:start position:0%
they're not completely separate branches
 
04:19:11.910 --> 04:19:11.920 align:start position:0%
of government they're supposed to work
 
04:19:14.870 --> 04:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
together second so what is the duty of
 
04:19:17.030 --> 04:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch it's the duty of the
 
04:19:18.670 --> 04:19:18.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Supreme Court in the words
 
04:19:21.429 --> 04:19:21.439 align:start position:0%
of G allanar and he is the director of
 
04:19:23.109 --> 04:19:23.119 align:start position:0%
the center for State constitutional
 
04:19:25.189 --> 04:19:25.199 align:start position:0%
studies at ruter and a professor of
 
04:19:26.510 --> 04:19:26.520 align:start position:0%
political science there and he wrote an
 
04:19:28.389 --> 04:19:28.399 align:start position:0%
article called thinking about separation
 
04:19:30.469 --> 04:19:30.479 align:start position:0%
of powers in New Hampshire the duty of
 
04:19:31.910 --> 04:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Supreme Court is to
 
04:19:35.189 --> 04:19:35.199 align:start position:0%
say what the law is Additionally the New
 
04:19:36.830 --> 04:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court has the duty to
 
04:19:38.670 --> 04:19:38.680 align:start position:0%
enforce the Constitution as was
 
04:19:41.189 --> 04:19:41.199 align:start position:0%
explained by judge Levi Woodbury and all
 
04:19:42.990 --> 04:19:43.000 align:start position:0%
of us know that he was not only on our
 
04:19:45.510 --> 04:19:45.520 align:start position:0%
state supreme court he was a governor
 
04:19:48.149 --> 04:19:48.159 align:start position:0%
Speaker of the House a senator Justice
 
04:19:50.109 --> 04:19:50.119 align:start position:0%
on the US Supreme Court and a secretary
 
04:19:53.429 --> 04:19:53.439 align:start position:0%
of US navian Treasury he said that the
 
04:19:55.269 --> 04:19:55.279 align:start position:0%
rule of law was only one benefit that
 
04:19:57.109 --> 04:19:57.119 align:start position:0%
would flow from judicial Independence
 
04:19:58.990 --> 04:19:59.000 align:start position:0%
independent courts and only independent
 
04:20:00.870 --> 04:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
ones could also help to enforce the
 
04:20:03.269 --> 04:20:03.279 align:start position:0%
Constitution so the courts have two jobs
 
04:20:04.990 --> 04:20:05.000 align:start position:0%
tell us what the law is to enforce the
 
04:20:07.189 --> 04:20:07.199 align:start position:0%
Constitution so the question is did the
 
04:20:09.030 --> 04:20:09.040 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court overstep its bounds in the
 
04:20:11.070 --> 04:20:11.080 align:start position:0%
Claremont case and I would say no the
 
04:20:12.910 --> 04:20:12.920 align:start position:0%
court in Claremont laid out the
 
04:20:15.309 --> 04:20:15.319 align:start position:0%
framework for the legislature one it's
 
04:20:17.149 --> 04:20:17.159 align:start position:0%
the state's duty to fund an adequate
 
04:20:18.870 --> 04:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
education for all children in the public
 
04:20:21.229 --> 04:20:21.239 align:start position:0%
schools and two to Define inadequate
 
04:20:23.590 --> 04:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
education the court did this because of
 
04:20:25.950 --> 04:20:25.960 align:start position:0%
prolonged inaction on the part of the
 
04:20:28.229 --> 04:20:28.239 align:start position:0%
state which failed to live up to its
 
04:20:30.349 --> 04:20:30.359 align:start position:0%
constitutional obligations the court
 
04:20:32.070 --> 04:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
gave considerable difference to the
 
04:20:34.349 --> 04:20:34.359 align:start position:0%
legislature and the governor quote in
 
04:20:36.070 --> 04:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
claremount one to fulfill their
 
04:20:37.790 --> 04:20:37.800 align:start position:0%
responsibilities to defining the
 
04:20:39.630 --> 04:20:39.640 align:start position:0%
specifics of and the appropriate means
 
04:20:41.750 --> 04:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
to provide through public education and
 
04:20:43.469 --> 04:20:43.479 align:start position:0%
in Claremont 2 they noted the
 
04:20:45.510 --> 04:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
legislature would quote have lied wide
 
04:20:47.429 --> 04:20:47.439 align:start position:0%
latitude in choosing the means by which
 
04:20:49.830 --> 04:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
public education is be to be supported
 
04:20:51.469 --> 04:20:51.479 align:start position:0%
if the court had not pointed out the
 
04:20:53.469 --> 04:20:53.479 align:start position:0%
prolonged legislative inaction it would
 
04:20:55.710 --> 04:20:55.720 align:start position:0%
not have been doing its job which is to
 
04:20:57.469 --> 04:20:57.479 align:start position:0%
say what the laws and to help enforce
 
04:21:00.750 --> 04:21:00.760 align:start position:0%
the constitution in those two cases they
 
04:21:02.189 --> 04:21:02.199 align:start position:0%
didn't just come up with something
 
04:21:05.670 --> 04:21:05.680 align:start position:0%
willy-nilly they went back to the 1700s
 
04:21:08.030 --> 04:21:08.040 align:start position:0%
in Claremont 1 they quoted they cited
 
04:21:09.990 --> 04:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
governor wenworth who made it clear in
 
04:21:11.870 --> 04:21:11.880 align:start position:0%
his address to the council chamber of
 
04:21:13.870 --> 04:21:13.880 align:start position:0%
the house of assembly in
 
04:21:16.830 --> 04:21:16.840 align:start position:0%
1771 that the duty to educate remained
 
04:21:19.229 --> 04:21:19.239 align:start position:0%
with the state they cited the house in
 
04:21:22.269 --> 04:21:22.279 align:start position:0%
the state in 1795 which said the same
 
04:21:24.109 --> 04:21:24.119 align:start position:0%
thing and they say this statement has
 
04:21:25.830 --> 04:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
significant probative value as an
 
04:21:27.750 --> 04:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
indication that the Contemporary
 
04:21:30.109 --> 04:21:30.119 align:start position:0%
understanding of article 83 imposed a
 
04:21:32.630 --> 04:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
duty on the state to provide Universal
 
04:21:34.710 --> 04:21:34.720 align:start position:0%
education and support the schools they
 
04:21:36.389 --> 04:21:36.399 align:start position:0%
didn't make it up they went back it's
 
04:21:38.550 --> 04:21:38.560 align:start position:0%
spend the law of New Hampshire for 250
 
04:21:41.950 --> 04:21:41.960 align:start position:0%
years that brings us lastly to third
 
04:21:44.070 --> 04:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
what's the do of the legislature in this
 
04:21:47.149 --> 04:21:47.159 align:start position:0%
situation if you choose to ignore Court
 
04:21:49.790 --> 04:21:49.800 align:start position:0%
decisions I believe that you not only
 
04:21:52.429 --> 04:21:52.439 align:start position:0%
would lead to less funding for education
 
04:21:54.750 --> 04:21:54.760 align:start position:0%
but you would weaken yourself as a body
 
04:21:56.309 --> 04:21:56.319 align:start position:0%
this is from an article in the American
 
04:21:59.469 --> 04:21:59.479 align:start position:0%
Journal of legal history in 1995 another
 
04:22:01.389 --> 04:22:01.399 align:start position:0%
article on separation of powers in New
 
04:22:03.910 --> 04:22:03.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh Thomas Lowry were the
 
04:22:06.349 --> 04:22:06.359 align:start position:0%
legislature to ignore the Court's honest
 
04:22:08.910 --> 04:22:08.920 align:start position:0%
constitutional objections legislators
 
04:22:10.870 --> 04:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
would severely undermine their own
 
04:22:13.189 --> 04:22:13.199 align:start position:0%
authority their laws would be exposed is
 
04:22:16.510 --> 04:22:16.520 align:start position:0%
mere acts of force deserving no respect
 
04:22:18.790 --> 04:22:18.800 align:start position:0%
the resolution focuses on the idea of
 
04:22:20.510 --> 04:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
independent branches of government
 
04:22:22.429 --> 04:22:22.439 align:start position:0%
ignoring that they are tied together if
 
04:22:25.550 --> 04:22:25.560 align:start position:0%
you weaken this you weaken all of the
 
04:22:27.309 --> 04:22:27.319 align:start position:0%
branches and I leave you with one other
 
04:22:30.229 --> 04:22:30.239 align:start position:0%
thought if you can ignore the courts
 
04:22:32.269 --> 04:22:32.279 align:start position:0%
then what's to stop the Executive Branch
 
04:22:35.109 --> 04:22:35.119 align:start position:0%
from ignoring you when you make a law it
 
04:22:36.990 --> 04:22:37.000 align:start position:0%
gets implemented by the executive branch
 
04:22:39.550 --> 04:22:39.560 align:start position:0%
they pass regulations the regulations
 
04:22:42.630 --> 04:22:42.640 align:start position:0%
the common understanding is they must ad
 
04:22:44.830 --> 04:22:44.840 align:start position:0%
here to the law the regulations can only
 
04:22:46.750 --> 04:22:46.760 align:start position:0%
fill in the details they can't add to or
 
04:22:48.510 --> 04:22:48.520 align:start position:0%
subtract from the law it has to be
 
04:22:50.469 --> 04:22:50.479 align:start position:0%
approved by the legislature if you're
 
04:22:52.870 --> 04:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
capable of ignoring the court what's to
 
04:22:54.630 --> 04:22:54.640 align:start position:0%
stop the Executive Branch from ignoring
 
04:22:56.510 --> 04:22:56.520 align:start position:0%
you and just doing essentially whatever
 
04:22:58.469 --> 04:22:58.479 align:start position:0%
they want and then you would have three
 
04:23:00.429 --> 04:23:00.439 align:start position:0%
weak branches of government we're better
 
04:23:02.149 --> 04:23:02.159 align:start position:0%
off with three strong branches of
 
04:23:04.469 --> 04:23:04.479 align:start position:0%
government that work together in this
 
04:23:05.990 --> 04:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
case you've got a clear directive that
 
04:23:10.670 --> 04:23:10.680 align:start position:0%
goes back 250 years we should implement
 
04:23:13.830 --> 04:23:13.840 align:start position:0%
this longstanding duty of our and lastly
 
04:23:15.590 --> 04:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
you have an alternative remedy if you
 
04:23:17.710 --> 04:23:17.720 align:start position:0%
don't like the court
 
04:23:20.070 --> 04:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
decision argue for a constitutional
 
04:23:22.030 --> 04:23:22.040 align:start position:0%
amendment to make it very clear if
 
04:23:23.870 --> 04:23:23.880 align:start position:0%
enough people would support it then that
 
04:23:25.550 --> 04:23:25.560 align:start position:0%
would solve the problem but ignoring the
 
04:23:28.510 --> 04:23:28.520 align:start position:0%
court is not the correct step thank you
 
04:23:30.790 --> 04:23:30.800 align:start position:0%
questions for this witness yeah
 
04:23:30.800 --> 04:23:32.149 align:start position:0%
questions for this witness yeah
representative

04:23:32.149 --> 04:23:32.159 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:23:35.870 --> 04:23:35.880 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you um what do you think
 
04:23:40.149 --> 04:23:40.159 align:start position:0%
would have happened if low these many
 
04:23:44.469 --> 04:23:44.479 align:start position:0%
years ago um the then incumbent Governor
 
04:23:49.910 --> 04:23:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:52.790 --> 04:23:52.800 align:start position:0%
formula and so that would have can you
 
04:23:55.189 --> 04:23:55.199 align:start position:0%
just spell that out a little bit more
 
04:23:57.950 --> 04:23:57.960 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry well that's all right I'll
 
04:24:00.349 --> 04:24:00.359 align:start position:0%
pass thank you all right other questions
 
04:24:03.510 --> 04:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:06.429 --> 04:24:06.439 align:start position:0%
trp are you in favor of local control of
 
04:24:07.950 --> 04:24:07.960 align:start position:0%
the schools
 
04:24:10.910 --> 04:24:10.920 align:start position:0%
yes um are you familiar with the the
 
04:24:13.229 --> 04:24:13.239 align:start position:0%
phrase who pays the pipe for cause the
 
04:24:17.590 --> 04:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
tune yes do you think that uh the state
 
04:24:21.870 --> 04:24:21.880 align:start position:0%
should they decide to uh uh fully fund
 
04:24:23.870 --> 04:24:23.880 align:start position:0%
the schools would be within their
 
04:24:26.510 --> 04:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
purview to uh Take Over Control of local
 
04:24:31.189 --> 04:24:31.199 align:start position:0%
schools no why the the court in
 
04:24:33.910 --> 04:24:33.920 align:start position:0%
Claremont said that the it pointed out
 
04:24:35.790 --> 04:24:35.800 align:start position:0%
the historical reason that the local
 
04:24:39.030 --> 04:24:39.040 align:start position:0%
school dri districts were created to
 
04:24:43.389 --> 04:24:43.399 align:start position:0%
help the state administer its Duty so
 
04:24:46.070 --> 04:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
local control people have local control
 
04:24:48.630 --> 04:24:48.640 align:start position:0%
the duty the duty to fund it lies with
 
04:24:51.189 --> 04:24:51.199 align:start position:0%
the state the control lies with the
 
04:24:51.199 --> 04:24:53.990 align:start position:0%
the state the control lies with the
local

04:24:53.990 --> 04:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:57.510 --> 04:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
towns representative Horan um I guess
 
04:24:59.030 --> 04:24:59.040 align:start position:0%
that's the flip side of this question
 
04:25:01.510 --> 04:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
which was do you feel that a school
 
04:25:03.670 --> 04:25:03.680 align:start position:0%
board which has more money at its
 
04:25:05.790 --> 04:25:05.800 align:start position:0%
disposal from whatever Source has more
 
04:25:08.910 --> 04:25:08.920 align:start position:0%
control and more over what options it
 
04:25:11.389 --> 04:25:11.399 align:start position:0%
chooses to educate the uh students in
 
04:25:13.389 --> 04:25:13.399 align:start position:0%
his district as opposed to one that
 
04:25:16.309 --> 04:25:16.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't have enough funding absolutely
 
04:25:18.870 --> 04:25:18.880 align:start position:0%
and if there's these two cases you've
 
04:25:21.429 --> 04:25:21.439 align:start position:0%
got conal and the Rand case the convel
 
04:25:23.950 --> 04:25:23.960 align:start position:0%
case is the base adequacy the Rand case
 
04:25:27.189 --> 04:25:27.199 align:start position:0%
would be differentiated a so special in
 
04:25:29.910 --> 04:25:29.920 align:start position:0%
that if if the state were to live up to
 
04:25:32.349 --> 04:25:32.359 align:start position:0%
its duty to do base adequacy as
 
04:25:34.429 --> 04:25:34.439 align:start position:0%
prescribed by conel plus lived up to
 
04:25:37.070 --> 04:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
special ed or at least say 60% of it
 
04:25:39.830 --> 04:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
assuming the feds ever did their 40%
 
04:25:41.950 --> 04:25:41.960 align:start position:0%
that would be a base from which any town
 
04:25:44.670 --> 04:25:44.680 align:start position:0%
in the State even towns like Newport
 
04:25:46.349 --> 04:25:46.359 align:start position:0%
would be able to have adequately
 
04:25:47.790 --> 04:25:47.800 align:start position:0%
functioning schools because they could
 
04:25:49.590 --> 04:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
add on what they could afford from their
 
04:25:51.349 --> 04:25:51.359 align:start position:0%
local property taxes and if the towns
 
04:25:53.189 --> 04:25:53.199 align:start position:0%
that are well more well off they can do
 
04:25:54.870 --> 04:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
whatever they want to as well but I
 
04:25:57.109 --> 04:25:57.119 align:start position:0%
think the state is the Constitution
 
04:25:59.469 --> 04:25:59.479 align:start position:0%
makes it clear every town should be
 
04:26:02.149 --> 04:26:02.159 align:start position:0%
receiving from the state base adequacy
 
04:26:04.710 --> 04:26:04.720 align:start position:0%
plus special ed that would be enough to
 
04:26:06.550 --> 04:26:06.560 align:start position:0%
allow every town to have a chance so
 
04:26:08.429 --> 04:26:08.439 align:start position:0%
that every child in the state gets a
 
04:26:08.439 --> 04:26:11.229 align:start position:0%
that every child in the state gets a
good

04:26:11.229 --> 04:26:11.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:13.149 --> 04:26:13.159 align:start position:0%
education other questions yes
 
04:26:14.830 --> 04:26:14.840 align:start position:0%
representative Perez thank you thanks
 
04:26:17.550 --> 04:26:17.560 align:start position:0%
for taking me correct me if I'm wrong
 
04:26:19.510 --> 04:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
but is it it's my understanding that the
 
04:26:21.349 --> 04:26:21.359 align:start position:0%
court that the case that is before the
 
04:26:23.750 --> 04:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
courts right now is to
 
04:26:26.229 --> 04:26:26.239 align:start position:0%
increase that
 
04:26:30.149 --> 04:26:30.159 align:start position:0%
base of adequacy Education increase That
 
04:26:33.189 --> 04:26:33.199 align:start position:0%
Base so by doing this are we saying to
 
04:26:36.269 --> 04:26:36.279 align:start position:0%
them if you say we need to increase this
 
04:26:39.550 --> 04:26:39.560 align:start position:0%
and we as legislators say we don't have
 
04:26:43.429 --> 04:26:43.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:46.550 --> 04:26:46.560 align:start position:0%
do you feel that that's okay to do for
 
04:26:48.269 --> 04:26:48.279 align:start position:0%
us thank you for the question
 
04:26:50.790 --> 04:26:50.800 align:start position:0%
representative prz so two things the
 
04:26:52.269 --> 04:26:52.279 align:start position:0%
court is not saying that we should
 
04:26:55.269 --> 04:26:55.279 align:start position:0%
increase the the court was the the the
 
04:26:58.229 --> 04:26:58.239 align:start position:0%
the conil trial happened it went to the
 
04:27:00.670 --> 04:27:00.680 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court Supreme Court said not
 
04:27:03.030 --> 04:27:03.040 align:start position:0%
enough here they remanded it back to the
 
04:27:06.469 --> 04:27:06.479 align:start position:0%
superior court for further Evidence they
 
04:27:08.670 --> 04:27:08.680 align:start position:0%
held a 3-we trial they brought in dozens
 
04:27:10.590 --> 04:27:10.600 align:start position:0%
of witnesses superintendent and finance
 
04:27:13.030 --> 04:27:13.040 align:start position:0%
people and said this is the bare minimum
 
04:27:15.109 --> 04:27:15.119 align:start position:0%
that we could do at a base adequacy not
 
04:27:16.870 --> 04:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
not looking at special ed but just base
 
04:27:18.910 --> 04:27:18.920 align:start position:0%
adequacy so they're not really saying
 
04:27:20.510 --> 04:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
let's increase base adequacy they're
 
04:27:22.710 --> 04:27:22.720 align:start position:0%
saying what is base adequacy and the
 
04:27:24.670 --> 04:27:24.680 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court instructed that trial
 
04:27:27.189 --> 04:27:27.199 align:start position:0%
court judge to determine how much does
 
04:27:30.469 --> 04:27:30.479 align:start position:0%
it cost to to meet base adequacy so
 
04:27:31.710 --> 04:27:31.720 align:start position:0%
that's what that judge did he was
 
04:27:33.349 --> 04:27:33.359 align:start position:0%
instructed to do that he did what he was
 
04:27:34.790 --> 04:27:34.800 align:start position:0%
instructed to and that happens in cases
 
04:27:36.229 --> 04:27:36.239 align:start position:0%
all the time Supreme Court remands back
 
04:27:38.429 --> 04:27:38.439 align:start position:0%
to the supremor court give us more facts
 
04:27:39.710 --> 04:27:39.720 align:start position:0%
you don't have enough facts for us to
 
04:27:42.790 --> 04:27:42.800 align:start position:0%
make a final decision so if that happen
 
04:27:44.309 --> 04:27:44.319 align:start position:0%
I think the people of the state would
 
04:27:45.990 --> 04:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
say okay that's the way we're going to
 
04:27:48.950 --> 04:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
do it it's the state's job to fund good
 
04:27:50.229 --> 04:27:50.239 align:start position:0%
then the state will come up with some
 
04:27:52.109 --> 04:27:52.119 align:start position:0%
funding source and then as I answered to
 
04:27:53.550 --> 04:27:53.560 align:start position:0%
representative Horan then the towns
 
04:27:55.630 --> 04:27:55.640 align:start position:0%
would be able to on top of that add on
 
04:27:57.389 --> 04:27:57.399 align:start position:0%
whatever they
 
04:28:01.070 --> 04:28:01.080 align:start position:0%
wanted sure other questions for this
 
04:28:03.429 --> 04:28:03.439 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you very much
 
04:28:05.910 --> 04:28:05.920 align:start position:0%

no hi
 
04:28:26.389 --> 04:28:26.399 align:start position:0%
hi good afternoon honorable chairman and
 
04:28:28.950 --> 04:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
members of the Judiciary Committee my
 
04:28:31.550 --> 04:28:31.560 align:start position:0%
name is Caitlyn Bernier and I live in
 
04:28:35.109 --> 04:28:35.119 align:start position:0%
marac I'm here today as a taxpayer a
 
04:28:38.510 --> 04:28:38.520 align:start position:0%
parent and a member of our school budget
 
04:28:41.710 --> 04:28:41.720 align:start position:0%
committee I this is this was my first
 
04:28:45.590 --> 04:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
year on the budget committee and I went
 
04:28:48.910 --> 04:28:48.920 align:start position:0%
all in I spoke with everybody I could I
 
04:28:51.710 --> 04:28:51.720 align:start position:0%
read all the things I compared to all
 
04:28:52.790 --> 04:28:52.800 align:start position:0%
the different
 
04:28:56.830 --> 04:28:56.840 align:start position:0%
towns I I went in deep um and it was
 
04:29:02.109 --> 04:29:02.119 align:start position:0%
enlightening and also concerning um so
 
04:29:05.030 --> 04:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
fast forward to last night we had our
 
04:29:08.269 --> 04:29:08.279 align:start position:0%
deliberative session for our school uh
 
04:29:11.790 --> 04:29:11.800 align:start position:0%
District budget and the past few years
 
04:29:14.750 --> 04:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
it's gone from like 20 people going to
 
04:29:19.109 --> 04:29:19.119 align:start position:0%
like 400 people coming so we had at
 
04:29:22.070 --> 04:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
least 400 people there last night it was
 
04:29:26.389 --> 04:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
a a big deal for us um and uh we heard
 
04:29:29.389 --> 04:29:29.399 align:start position:0%
from many taxpayers about how they can't
 
04:29:33.030 --> 04:29:33.040 align:start position:0%
afford another property tax increase but
 
04:29:35.670 --> 04:29:35.680 align:start position:0%
they are seeing the progress from our
 
04:29:38.950 --> 04:29:38.960 align:start position:0%
students in Reading because we have
 
04:29:42.790 --> 04:29:42.800 align:start position:0%
invested uh taxpayer dollars into to
 
04:29:45.790 --> 04:29:45.800 align:start position:0%
prioritizing it ourselves within our
 
04:29:50.109 --> 04:29:50.119 align:start position:0%
district um The Narrative of pinning
 
04:29:53.469 --> 04:29:53.479 align:start position:0%
neighbors against neighbors for one that
 
04:29:56.429 --> 04:29:56.439 align:start position:0%
is rightfully demanding an appropriate
 
04:29:58.269 --> 04:29:58.279 align:start position:0%
adequate education for their young
 
04:30:01.830 --> 04:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
children and the equally valid um are
 
04:30:04.670 --> 04:30:04.680 align:start position:0%
our seniors and those on a fixed income
 
04:30:06.670 --> 04:30:06.680 align:start position:0%
with genuine concerns about affording
 
04:30:09.229 --> 04:30:09.239 align:start position:0%
the houses they raised their children in
 
04:30:11.309 --> 04:30:11.319 align:start position:0%
this has been a familiar theme in recent
 
04:30:13.750 --> 04:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
years of my Hometown and many towns in
 
04:30:16.349 --> 04:30:16.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire last night was different
 
04:30:19.149 --> 04:30:19.159 align:start position:0%
than I had anticipated in some ways and
 
04:30:21.710 --> 04:30:21.720 align:start position:0%
it gave me hope you see throughout the
 
04:30:24.149 --> 04:30:24.159 align:start position:0%
budget season many of us have been able
 
04:30:26.510 --> 04:30:26.520 align:start position:0%
to educate more of our constituents on
 
04:30:28.990 --> 04:30:29.000 align:start position:0%
the actual cost of providing an adequate
 
04:30:30.910 --> 04:30:30.920 align:start position:0%
education in
 
04:30:33.389 --> 04:30:33.399 align:start position:0%
2025 we have informed them about the
 
04:30:37.710 --> 04:30:37.720 align:start position:0%
conval and Rand law lawsuits and how
 
04:30:40.229 --> 04:30:40.239 align:start position:0%
unfortunately little our state has been
 
04:30:42.550 --> 04:30:42.560 align:start position:0%
contributing to the future generation s
 
04:30:45.389 --> 04:30:45.399 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire they have seen the
 
04:30:47.870 --> 04:30:47.880 align:start position:0%
decrease in funding over the last 10
 
04:30:52.269 --> 04:30:52.279 align:start position:0%
years they know that the that currently
 
04:30:55.189 --> 04:30:55.199 align:start position:0%
they're trying to overturn a ruling that
 
04:30:57.269 --> 04:30:57.279 align:start position:0%
requires the state to provide proper
 
04:30:59.910 --> 04:30:59.920 align:start position:0%
funding for our children's education
 
04:31:01.990 --> 04:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
they know you're willing to spend money
 
04:31:05.790 --> 04:31:05.800 align:start position:0%
on the select few who use efas but not
 
04:31:08.710 --> 04:31:08.720 align:start position:0%
the majority who use public school they
 
04:31:11.990 --> 04:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
know that the tax burden falls on them
 
04:31:15.070 --> 04:31:15.080 align:start position:0%
when those they elected continue to fail
 
04:31:18.870 --> 04:31:18.880 align:start position:0%
them so this time for every one person
 
04:31:21.149 --> 04:31:21.159 align:start position:0%
who spoke about how they can't take the
 
04:31:23.910 --> 04:31:23.920 align:start position:0%
tax increase I watched an average
 
04:31:26.670 --> 04:31:26.680 align:start position:0%
citizen who maybe has never spoken at
 
04:31:29.229 --> 04:31:29.239 align:start position:0%
one of these before go to the microphone
 
04:31:31.750 --> 04:31:31.760 align:start position:0%
and say that we need to hold the state
 
04:31:35.109 --> 04:31:35.119 align:start position:0%
accountable for properly for how we have
 
04:31:37.950 --> 04:31:37.960 align:start position:0%
not been properly funding an adequate
 
04:31:40.429 --> 04:31:40.439 align:start position:0%
education and to speak to their
 
04:31:42.990 --> 04:31:43.000 align:start position:0%
representatives and each time the room
 
04:31:45.910 --> 04:31:45.920 align:start position:0%
broke out in Applause I'm here today on
 
04:31:48.750 --> 04:31:48.760 align:start position:0%
behalf of my community and our future
 
04:31:50.950 --> 04:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
Generations that deserve better than
 
04:31:54.630 --> 04:31:54.640 align:start position:0%
your excuses be accountable and listen
 
04:31:58.070 --> 04:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
to your people when we say we agree with
 
04:32:01.710 --> 04:32:01.720 align:start position:0%
the Claremont and conal cases and
 
04:32:05.030 --> 04:32:05.040 align:start position:0%
expectations of the state to and to
 
04:32:07.429 --> 04:32:07.439 align:start position:0%
uphold those
 
04:32:11.429 --> 04:32:11.439 align:start position:0%
expectations the cost of uh educating a
 
04:32:15.189 --> 04:32:15.199 align:start position:0%
student has increased and when I
 
04:32:17.590 --> 04:32:17.600 align:start position:0%
graduated from the high school that now
 
04:32:20.510 --> 04:32:20.520 align:start position:0%
I get to find out the budget on 20 more
 
04:32:24.309 --> 04:32:24.319 align:start position:0%
year 20 years ago um our state actually
 
04:32:28.990 --> 04:32:29.000 align:start position:0%
provided more funding for our town 25
 
04:32:31.389 --> 04:32:31.399 align:start position:0%
years ago than they do
 
04:32:34.389 --> 04:32:34.399 align:start position:0%
now we have inflation we have all these
 
04:32:36.109 --> 04:32:36.119 align:start position:0%
things that we say are the reasons
 
04:32:38.630 --> 04:32:38.640 align:start position:0%
everything goes up what's the reason
 
04:32:41.429 --> 04:32:41.439 align:start position:0%
yours is going down and why are we just
 
04:32:45.950 --> 04:32:45.960 align:start position:0%
finding excuses and ways to say maybe if
 
04:32:48.429 --> 04:32:48.439 align:start position:0%
we you know pick this one verbage
 
04:32:50.830 --> 04:32:50.840 align:start position:0%
instead of just going all students
 
04:32:54.229 --> 04:32:54.239 align:start position:0%
deserve to be properly educated and have
 
04:32:56.309 --> 04:32:56.319 align:start position:0%
an adequate education and it shouldn't
 
04:33:00.349 --> 04:33:00.359 align:start position:0%
be at the cost of the parents so that is
 
04:33:02.870 --> 04:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
all I have today oh I'm in opposition I
 
04:33:05.150 --> 04:33:05.160 align:start position:0%
didn't I meant to lead with that I'm in
 
04:33:09.150 --> 04:33:09.160 align:start position:0%

time I'm a my name is Gregory sorg I'm a
 
04:33:41.789 --> 04:33:41.799 align:start position:0%
former four-term representative in the

New Hampshire house all on this
 
04:33:47.310 --> 04:33:47.320 align:start position:0%
committee and uh the last one uh as Vice
 
04:33:49.510 --> 04:33:49.520 align:start position:0%
chair I've been an attorney in the state
 
04:33:52.390 --> 04:33:52.400 align:start position:0%
since 1981 I'm a real estate
 
04:33:54.029 --> 04:33:54.039 align:start position:0%
practitioner I work out of my house in
 
04:33:56.310 --> 04:33:56.320 align:start position:0%
Easton and yet I'm in the strange
 
04:33:59.429 --> 04:33:59.439 align:start position:0%
position of uh relevant to what we're
 
04:34:01.310 --> 04:34:01.320 align:start position:0%
talking about here as being the
 
04:34:04.189 --> 04:34:04.199 align:start position:0%
attorney representing 27 house members
 
04:34:06.830 --> 04:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
and two senators as a mikas cier in the
 
04:34:09.590 --> 04:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
conval litigation that's now going
 
04:34:12.869 --> 04:34:12.879 align:start position:0%
on we were able to
 
04:34:14.551 --> 04:34:14.561 align:start position:0%
get ourselves involved in that case
 
04:34:16.029 --> 04:34:16.039 align:start position:0%
through the
 
04:34:19.109 --> 04:34:19.119 align:start position:0%
uh the language of article 80 of article
 
04:34:23.470 --> 04:34:23.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:26.949 --> 04:34:26.959 align:start position:0%
which which uh puts the duty that's
 
04:34:29.070 --> 04:34:29.080 align:start position:0%
under under consideration here on the
 
04:34:31.910 --> 04:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
legislators not on the legislature as
 
04:34:33.070 --> 04:34:33.080 align:start position:0%
the parallel provision of the
 
04:34:36.349 --> 04:34:36.359 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts con constitution does that
 
04:34:37.910 --> 04:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
means that what's under contention here
 
04:34:39.789 --> 04:34:39.799 align:start position:0%
is the content of the duty of each of
 
04:34:41.949 --> 04:34:41.959 align:start position:0%
you and all of your colleagues and it's
 
04:34:44.629 --> 04:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
being hashed about in the Supreme Court
 
04:34:47.709 --> 04:34:47.719 align:start position:0%
in the conval case by the judicial
 
04:34:50.150 --> 04:34:50.160 align:start position:0%
branch and the executive
 
04:34:53.830 --> 04:34:53.840 align:start position:0%
branch they're going to tell you how
 
04:34:56.789 --> 04:34:56.799 align:start position:0%
much what the the uh limitations on your
 
04:34:56.799 --> 04:35:00.310 align:start position:0%
much what the the uh limitations on your
Authority

04:35:00.310 --> 04:35:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:06.990 --> 04:35:07.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:08.910 --> 04:35:08.920 align:start position:0%
2018 no
 
04:35:11.670 --> 04:35:11.680 align:start position:0%
2019 uh representative Hill and former
 
04:35:13.390 --> 04:35:13.400 align:start position:0%
pres of balbon and I went to the
 
04:35:16.269 --> 04:35:16.279 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office to urge them
 
04:35:17.869 --> 04:35:17.879 align:start position:0%
the the conell case was then before the
 
04:35:20.070 --> 04:35:20.080 align:start position:0%
court and to urge them to argue that
 
04:35:23.551 --> 04:35:23.561 align:start position:0%
that uh the uh Claremont precedent
 
04:35:24.470 --> 04:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
should be
 
04:35:26.670 --> 04:35:26.680 align:start position:0%
overruled because with each iteration of
 
04:35:28.310 --> 04:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
the Claremont
 
04:35:31.109 --> 04:35:31.119 align:start position:0%
case in subsequent appeals the court has
 
04:35:32.990 --> 04:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
involved itself more and more into
 
04:35:34.670 --> 04:35:34.680 align:start position:0%
policy areas that it's supposed to stay
 
04:35:37.109 --> 04:35:37.119 align:start position:0%
out of what it's tried to do is to
 
04:35:40.269 --> 04:35:40.279 align:start position:0%
instruct the legislature as to what they
 
04:35:42.029 --> 04:35:42.039 align:start position:0%
what kind of laws they should pass
 
04:35:44.029 --> 04:35:44.039 align:start position:0%
they're not they won't order what sort
 
04:35:46.510 --> 04:35:46.520 align:start position:0%
of laws you must pass they're they're
 
04:35:48.070 --> 04:35:48.080 align:start position:0%
not the precise laws you should pass but
 
04:35:50.670 --> 04:35:50.680 align:start position:0%
what to guide you towards what they want
 
04:35:52.429 --> 04:35:52.439 align:start position:0%
you to do because they know they can't
 
04:35:55.269 --> 04:35:55.279 align:start position:0%
tell you what laws to pass so if you
 
04:35:57.029 --> 04:35:57.039 align:start position:0%
pass the laws that they like they can
 
04:35:58.670 --> 04:35:58.680 align:start position:0%
say well we didn't do it we didn't make
 
04:36:01.310 --> 04:36:01.320 align:start position:0%
a policy decision the legislature did
 
04:36:03.750 --> 04:36:03.760 align:start position:0%
but the more they involved themselves
 
04:36:06.910 --> 04:36:06.920 align:start position:0%
in putting blinders on the and narrowing
 
04:36:08.551 --> 04:36:08.561 align:start position:0%
the focus of the legislature the more
 
04:36:10.629 --> 04:36:10.639 align:start position:0%
they're in fact making policy decisions
 
04:36:12.750 --> 04:36:12.760 align:start position:0%
even though they're not saying
 
04:36:16.789 --> 04:36:16.799 align:start position:0%
so on behalf of of the legislative as I
 
04:36:18.590 --> 04:36:18.600 align:start position:0%
as I called them we filed several
 
04:36:23.310 --> 04:36:23.320 align:start position:0%
pleadings we filed a brief in the 2020
 
04:36:25.551 --> 04:36:25.561 align:start position:0%
appeal which basically explained why
 
04:36:29.029 --> 04:36:29.039 align:start position:0%
Claremont was incorrectly decided in
 
04:36:30.910 --> 04:36:30.920 align:start position:0%
when it came back on another appeal in
 
04:36:33.429 --> 04:36:33.439 align:start position:0%
2024 we filed a memorandum which
 
04:36:36.070 --> 04:36:36.080 align:start position:0%
basically was to remind the court of the
 
04:36:36.080 --> 04:36:38.310 align:start position:0%
basically was to remind the court of the
2020

04:36:38.310 --> 04:36:38.320 align:start position:0%
2020
 
04:36:42.109 --> 04:36:42.119 align:start position:0%
uh uh brief and explain why and how the
 
04:36:44.830 --> 04:36:44.840 align:start position:0%
the court should overrule Claremont and
 
04:36:48.349 --> 04:36:48.359 align:start position:0%
both efforts were objected to by the uh
 
04:36:52.310 --> 04:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
plaintiffs which is to me rather absurd
 
04:36:54.629 --> 04:36:54.639 align:start position:0%
way of proceeding because they they are
 
04:36:56.949 --> 04:36:56.959 align:start position:0%
saying in effect that the legislature
 
04:37:00.230 --> 04:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
even through these uh 31 of them I
 
04:37:02.390 --> 04:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
represented should not have any voice in
 
04:37:04.429 --> 04:37:04.439 align:start position:0%
what's going on while your future is
 
04:37:06.310 --> 04:37:06.320 align:start position:0%
being your future ability to legislate
 
04:37:08.189 --> 04:37:08.199 align:start position:0%
is being contended over by the
 
04:37:10.390 --> 04:37:10.400 align:start position:0%
Legislative by the executive and the
 
04:37:16.109 --> 04:37:16.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:17.551 --> 04:37:17.561 align:start position:0%
the uh the plaintiffs actually filed a
 
04:37:19.189 --> 04:37:19.199 align:start position:0%
motion to strike our memorandum to which
 
04:37:21.750 --> 04:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
we filed an objection and I go over this
 
04:37:23.189 --> 04:37:23.199 align:start position:0%
history because I've prepared for the
 
04:37:25.510 --> 04:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
committee a compilation of those four
 
04:37:28.629 --> 04:37:28.639 align:start position:0%
pleadings are our brief from 2020 our
 
04:37:31.590 --> 04:37:31.600 align:start position:0%
memorandum from September of last year
 
04:37:33.709 --> 04:37:33.719 align:start position:0%
the objection that was filed to it or
 
04:37:35.349 --> 04:37:35.359 align:start position:0%
the motion to strike it which was filed
 
04:37:36.910 --> 04:37:36.920 align:start position:0%
by the plaintiffs and our objection to
 
04:37:38.189 --> 04:37:38.199 align:start position:0%
that motion to
 
04:37:40.709 --> 04:37:40.719 align:start position:0%
strike uh are are in here and I'll
 
04:37:42.551 --> 04:37:42.561 align:start position:0%
submit them to you
 
04:37:44.109 --> 04:37:44.119 align:start position:0%
the current situation in the conval
 
04:37:47.551 --> 04:37:47.561 align:start position:0%
litigation is that the latest appeal has
 
04:37:49.910 --> 04:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
been briefed and argued it was argued
 
04:37:52.109 --> 04:37:52.119 align:start position:0%
last December 11th I believe and uh
 
04:37:54.750 --> 04:37:54.760 align:start position:0%
we're awaiting a ruling the plaintiffs
 
04:37:56.551 --> 04:37:56.561 align:start position:0%
have asked the Supreme Court to enforce
 
04:37:59.629 --> 04:37:59.639 align:start position:0%
the the order of the Superior Court
 
04:38:01.109 --> 04:38:01.119 align:start position:0%
which so basically orders the
 
04:38:02.869 --> 04:38:02.879 align:start position:0%
legislature to spend another half
 
04:38:05.789 --> 04:38:05.799 align:start position:0%
billion dollars in in education funding
 
04:38:08.551 --> 04:38:08.561 align:start position:0%
to fund adequacy as it was determined by
 
04:38:11.830 --> 04:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
uh judge ruoff in the Superior Court
 
04:38:13.750 --> 04:38:13.760 align:start position:0%
this is the culmination of 30 years of
 
04:38:15.510 --> 04:38:15.520 align:start position:0%
sparring between the legislature and the
 
04:38:17.910 --> 04:38:17.920 align:start position:0%
court on this issue this eventuality was
 
04:38:20.429 --> 04:38:20.439 align:start position:0%
totally predictable back in 1994 I
 
04:38:22.629 --> 04:38:22.639 align:start position:0%
remember when I first read The Claremont
 
04:38:24.590 --> 04:38:24.600 align:start position:0%
decision I could see where it was going
 
04:38:26.629 --> 04:38:26.639 align:start position:0%
to head you could not comply with the
 
04:38:29.830 --> 04:38:29.840 align:start position:0%
Claremont decision in full that is 100%
 
04:38:32.869 --> 04:38:32.879 align:start position:0%
funded adequate Education Without a
 
04:38:32.879 --> 04:38:34.150 align:start position:0%
funded adequate Education Without a
broad-based

04:38:34.150 --> 04:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
broad-based
 
04:38:38.830 --> 04:38:38.840 align:start position:0%
tax and we know how much we talk about
 
04:38:41.551 --> 04:38:41.561 align:start position:0%
cherish how much we cherish not having a
 
04:38:43.750 --> 04:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
broad-based tax in the state an income
 
04:38:44.990 --> 04:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
tax or sales
 
04:38:48.510 --> 04:38:48.520 align:start position:0%
tax and what the court did was place the
 
04:38:50.269 --> 04:38:50.279 align:start position:0%
legislature be between the proverbial
 
04:38:52.109 --> 04:38:52.119 align:start position:0%
Rock and the hard place you either
 
04:38:54.629 --> 04:38:54.639 align:start position:0%
comply with the court and anger your
 
04:38:57.230 --> 04:38:57.240 align:start position:0%
constituents who put you into office to
 
04:39:00.670 --> 04:39:00.680 align:start position:0%
preserve New Hampshire as a as a
 
04:39:03.349 --> 04:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
uh a state without a broad-based tax or
 
04:39:05.670 --> 04:39:05.680 align:start position:0%
you do what your constituents want and
 
04:39:07.109 --> 04:39:07.119 align:start position:0%
repudiate the
 
04:39:10.109 --> 04:39:10.119 align:start position:0%
court so now we have now that we've come
 
04:39:11.910 --> 04:39:11.920 align:start position:0%
to the point where the court is on the
 
04:39:16.869 --> 04:39:16.879 align:start position:0%
verge if they if they do uh affirm judge
 
04:39:19.390 --> 04:39:19.400 align:start position:0%
Rua's order we're in the position where
 
04:39:22.150 --> 04:39:22.160 align:start position:0%
we have three Alternatives
 
04:39:24.830 --> 04:39:24.840 align:start position:0%
here the judicial branch either backs
 
04:39:28.109 --> 04:39:28.119 align:start position:0%
off by overruling Claremont or that
 
04:39:29.750 --> 04:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
failing legislative branch either
 
04:39:31.949 --> 04:39:31.959 align:start position:0%
surrenders to the court thereby
 
04:39:33.910 --> 04:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
betraying the wishes of of your
 
04:39:35.949 --> 04:39:35.959 align:start position:0%
constituents and throwing the state into
 
04:39:35.959 --> 04:39:37.070 align:start position:0%
constituents and throwing the state into
fiscal

04:39:37.070 --> 04:39:37.080 align:start position:0%
fiscal
 
04:39:39.670 --> 04:39:39.680 align:start position:0%
chaos or you repudiate The Claremont
 
04:39:41.948 --> 04:39:41.958 align:start position:0%
decision via hcr1
 
04:39:43.868 --> 04:39:43.878 align:start position:0%
and thereby recover your constitutional
 
04:39:46.750 --> 04:39:46.760 align:start position:0%
Authority as the exclusive State policy
 
04:39:50.788 --> 04:39:50.798 align:start position:0%
Maker Now the opponents of hcr1 claim
 
04:39:54.230 --> 04:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
that passing hcr1 and repudiating the
 
04:39:55.628 --> 04:39:55.638 align:start position:0%
court would create a constitutional
 
04:39:58.270 --> 04:39:58.280 align:start position:0%
crisis well I contend that we've been in
 
04:40:01.708 --> 04:40:01.718 align:start position:0%
a constitutional crisis since 1993 when
 
04:40:04.270 --> 04:40:04.280 align:start position:0%
Claremont The Claremont Court knowing
 
04:40:07.230 --> 04:40:07.240 align:start position:0%
and deliberately cross the Rubicon by in
 
04:40:09.868 --> 04:40:09.878 align:start position:0%
interjecting itself into education
 
04:40:14.628 --> 04:40:14.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:15.868 --> 04:40:15.878 align:start position:0%
now I want I want to present a
 
04:40:15.878 --> 04:40:17.670 align:start position:0%
now I want I want to present a
hypothetical

04:40:17.670 --> 04:40:17.680 align:start position:0%
hypothetical
 
04:40:21.190 --> 04:40:21.200 align:start position:0%
here to illustrate what I'm urging you
 
04:40:24.310 --> 04:40:24.320 align:start position:0%
to consider suppose suppose that a
 
04:40:26.550 --> 04:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
murder had been committed the murderer
 
04:40:28.788 --> 04:40:28.798 align:start position:0%
apprehended no problem knowing that he
 
04:40:28.798 --> 04:40:29.830 align:start position:0%
apprehended no problem knowing that he
was

04:40:29.830 --> 04:40:29.840 align:start position:0%
was
 
04:40:32.270 --> 04:40:32.280 align:start position:0%
guilty and the trial is pending in the
 
04:40:34.470 --> 04:40:34.480 align:start position:0%
Superior Court you had a very
 
04:40:34.480 --> 04:40:35.708 align:start position:0%
Superior Court you had a very
sympathetic

04:40:35.708 --> 04:40:35.718 align:start position:0%
sympathetic
 
04:40:39.150 --> 04:40:39.160 align:start position:0%
victim and the accused was very
 
04:40:41.350 --> 04:40:41.360 align:start position:0%
OD and they they got the evidence
 
04:40:44.550 --> 04:40:44.560 align:start position:0%
against them but perhaps it was the the
 
04:40:45.868 --> 04:40:45.878 align:start position:0%
search that got that recovered the
 
04:40:47.190 --> 04:40:47.200 align:start position:0%
evidence is kind of dicey and it's
 
04:40:49.070 --> 04:40:49.080 align:start position:0%
possible that the case might be thrown
 
04:40:51.948 --> 04:40:51.958 align:start position:0%
out on a technicality so in order to
 
04:40:53.190 --> 04:40:53.200 align:start position:0%
prevent that the
 
04:40:55.510 --> 04:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
legislature uh passes a
 
04:40:58.190 --> 04:40:58.200 align:start position:0%
bill and it does it with all the you
 
04:41:00.230 --> 04:41:00.240 align:start position:0%
know all the forms of legislation
 
04:41:02.510 --> 04:41:02.520 align:start position:0%
whereas Clauses be it enacted by the
 
04:41:04.670 --> 04:41:04.680 align:start position:0%
Senate and the House of Representatives
 
04:41:06.310 --> 04:41:06.320 align:start position:0%
and what the bill says it declares the
 
04:41:08.670 --> 04:41:08.680 align:start position:0%
defendant guilty and imposes a life
 
04:41:10.750 --> 04:41:10.760 align:start position:0%
sentence on him and the governor signs
 
04:41:12.470 --> 04:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
that in the law and it's it's duly
 
04:41:14.310 --> 04:41:14.320 align:start position:0%
enrolled given a chapter number and then
 
04:41:15.990 --> 04:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
delivered to the judge what would the
 
04:41:18.390 --> 04:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
judge do with that the judge would
 
04:41:20.830 --> 04:41:20.840 align:start position:0%
repudiate he would just throw it
 
04:41:23.910 --> 04:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
away why would he do that it's because
 
04:41:26.550 --> 04:41:26.560 align:start position:0%
it would it would be a Judicial act that
 
04:41:29.830 --> 04:41:29.840 align:start position:0%
was made to look like a legislative act
 
04:41:32.510 --> 04:41:32.520 align:start position:0%
it crossed the line of the separation of
 
04:41:34.590 --> 04:41:34.600 align:start position:0%
powers so my question to you is
 
04:41:36.150 --> 04:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
shouldn't this work both
 
04:41:38.750 --> 04:41:38.760 align:start position:0%
ways Claremont The Claremont decision
 
04:41:40.708 --> 04:41:40.718 align:start position:0%
was a legislative act all gussied up to
 
04:41:43.350 --> 04:41:43.360 align:start position:0%
look like a judicial act it was very
 
04:41:47.510 --> 04:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
thinly disguised as such in my brief I
 
04:41:51.230 --> 04:41:51.240 align:start position:0%
explained why the court got it wrong
 
04:41:52.510 --> 04:41:52.520 align:start position:0%
because they read something into the
 
04:41:54.150 --> 04:41:54.160 align:start position:0%
Constitution that isn't there they read
 
04:41:55.390 --> 04:41:55.400 align:start position:0%
something out of the Constitution that
 
04:41:57.430 --> 04:41:57.440 align:start position:0%
was there and they fabricated the
 
04:42:01.030 --> 04:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
historical data that led them to that
 
04:42:03.910 --> 04:42:03.920 align:start position:0%
decision and they did that all in seven
 
04:42:06.110 --> 04:42:06.120 align:start position:0%
pages that's quite a ther for such a
 
04:42:06.120 --> 04:42:09.070 align:start position:0%
pages that's quite a ther for such a
short

04:42:09.070 --> 04:42:09.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:11.270 --> 04:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
decision so to conclude I would say I
 
04:42:12.788 --> 04:42:12.798 align:start position:0%
would suggest you that legislators are
 
04:42:15.310 --> 04:42:15.320 align:start position:0%
required to sign to to swear to the same
 
04:42:17.590 --> 04:42:17.600 align:start position:0%
constitutional oath as do judges the
 
04:42:20.310 --> 04:42:20.320 align:start position:0%
judges violated theirs in 1993 and
 
04:42:22.750 --> 04:42:22.760 align:start position:0%
continue to As Long As Claremont endur
 
04:42:25.390 --> 04:42:25.400 align:start position:0%
as precedent the justices perverted
 
04:42:27.590 --> 04:42:27.600 align:start position:0%
their interpretive function to transform
 
04:42:29.708 --> 04:42:29.718 align:start position:0%
a policy issue into a constitutional
 
04:42:33.270 --> 04:42:33.280 align:start position:0%
issue they use judicial forms to perform
 
04:42:36.030 --> 04:42:36.040 align:start position:0%
and provide cover for legislative
 
04:42:38.708 --> 04:42:38.718 align:start position:0%
acts I urge members of this committee
 
04:42:41.830 --> 04:42:41.840 align:start position:0%
and of the house not to violate Euro
 
04:42:43.708 --> 04:42:43.718 align:start position:0%
don't allow the Court's intrusion into
 
04:42:45.910 --> 04:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
your constitutional authority to
 
04:42:48.910 --> 04:42:48.920 align:start position:0%
continue I Ur you to vote ought to pass
 
04:42:51.310 --> 04:42:51.320 align:start position:0%
on hcr1 and start the process of
 
04:42:53.788 --> 04:42:53.798 align:start position:0%
reigning in the Judiciary saving it from
 
04:42:56.150 --> 04:42:56.160 align:start position:0%
the consequences of its own Folly and
 
04:42:58.110 --> 04:42:58.120 align:start position:0%
conceit and restoring the legislative
 
04:43:00.030 --> 04:43:00.040 align:start position:0%
Branch's exclusive authority to set
 
04:43:03.390 --> 04:43:03.400 align:start position:0%
State policy I thank the committee for
 
04:43:05.350 --> 04:43:05.360 align:start position:0%
hearing me out thank you questions for
 
04:43:08.150 --> 04:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
this witness yes yes representative
 
04:43:11.990 --> 04:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
Burch thank you Mr chair
 
04:43:13.990 --> 04:43:14.000 align:start position:0%
as long as we're talking about
 
04:43:17.150 --> 04:43:17.160 align:start position:0%
Oaths and as members of the legislature
 
04:43:20.230 --> 04:43:20.240 align:start position:0%
you know we take an oath to uphold the
 
04:43:22.430 --> 04:43:22.440 align:start position:0%
Constitution of the United States in the
 
04:43:25.070 --> 04:43:25.080 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire as attorneys we
 
04:43:27.750 --> 04:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
take a similar oath we're considered
 
04:43:31.110 --> 04:43:31.120 align:start position:0%
officers of the court so I want to ask
 
04:43:34.070 --> 04:43:34.080 align:start position:0%
you with that OB with those obligations
 
04:43:37.990 --> 04:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
in mind when discussing a bill that
 
04:43:42.628 --> 04:43:42.638 align:start position:0%
essentially says that if the legislature
 
04:43:44.910 --> 04:43:44.920 align:start position:0%
decides they don't like what a court
 
04:43:48.628 --> 04:43:48.638 align:start position:0%
orders they have a right to ignore it so
 
04:43:49.990 --> 04:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
I want to give you a different
 
04:43:53.110 --> 04:43:53.120 align:start position:0%
hypothetical and ask you're a practicing
 
04:43:57.550 --> 04:43:57.560 align:start position:0%
lawyer you've got a bunch of clients who
 
04:44:00.708 --> 04:44:00.718 align:start position:0%
are let's say divorce
 
04:44:03.708 --> 04:44:03.718 align:start position:0%
clients and they've been subject to a
 
04:44:05.750 --> 04:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
number of court
 
04:44:09.550 --> 04:44:09.560 align:start position:0%
orders I'm wondering how you decide as
 
04:44:13.670 --> 04:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
an attorney which court orders you tell
 
04:44:17.270 --> 04:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
your clients not to pay attention to
 
04:44:19.510 --> 04:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
because they're somehow outside the
 
04:44:22.670 --> 04:44:22.680 align:start position:0%
Court's Authority and which clients you
 
04:44:25.470 --> 04:44:25.480 align:start position:0%
tell that's a court order it's your job
 
04:44:28.430 --> 04:44:28.440 align:start position:0%
to obey it unless it's overturned
 
04:44:31.470 --> 04:44:31.480 align:start position:0%
through legal process well I'm just one
 
04:44:33.750 --> 04:44:33.760 align:start position:0%
person I'm one attorney I'm talking
 
04:44:36.310 --> 04:44:36.320 align:start position:0%
about an issue between two coordinate
 
04:44:39.070 --> 04:44:39.080 align:start position:0%
branches of the government here but I'm
 
04:44:43.190 --> 04:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
asking you because you're testifying and
 
04:44:45.230 --> 04:44:45.240 align:start position:0%
making statements in support of this
 
04:44:47.628 --> 04:44:47.638 align:start position:0%
bill I'm asking
 
04:44:52.030 --> 04:44:52.040 align:start position:0%
you how you would carry out in your own
 
04:44:57.270 --> 04:44:57.280 align:start position:0%
life this concept of uh judicial
 
04:44:59.550 --> 04:44:59.560 align:start position:0%
nullification oh in my life I I would
 
04:45:01.190 --> 04:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
have the client obey the court order no
 
04:45:02.830 --> 04:45:02.840 align:start position:0%
question about it it's not for me to
 
04:45:05.990 --> 04:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
decide what which orders to obey or not
 
04:45:07.510 --> 04:45:07.520 align:start position:0%
thank you but that's that's different
 
04:45:09.708 --> 04:45:09.718 align:start position:0%
this is an Institutional issue
 
04:45:11.590 --> 04:45:11.600 align:start position:0%
here I
 
04:45:13.270 --> 04:45:13.280 align:start position:0%
questions for this W yes representative
 
04:45:15.910 --> 04:45:15.920 align:start position:0%
Manos thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:45:17.910 --> 04:45:17.920 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I apologize I
 
04:45:20.510 --> 04:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
didn't catch your name Gregory sword
 
04:45:23.708 --> 04:45:23.718 align:start position:0%
sword org attorney sword um I wanted to
 
04:45:25.628 --> 04:45:25.638 align:start position:0%
ask you you spoke about
 
04:45:29.150 --> 04:45:29.160 align:start position:0%
repudiation um but this this bill that's
 
04:45:32.430 --> 04:45:32.440 align:start position:0%
before us is a house concurrent
 
04:45:35.788 --> 04:45:35.798 align:start position:0%
resolution so is it not correct that it
 
04:45:38.868 --> 04:45:38.878 align:start position:0%
is would even if passed would simply be
 
04:45:42.948 --> 04:45:42.958 align:start position:0%
a sense of the house and this is not
 
04:45:46.830 --> 04:45:46.840 align:start position:0%
would not be binding on any way
 
04:45:49.670 --> 04:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
on um an appropriation from the
 
04:45:51.948 --> 04:45:51.958 align:start position:0%
legislature or a non-appropriation from
 
04:45:54.708 --> 04:45:54.718 align:start position:0%
the legislature this this would not have
 
04:45:58.110 --> 04:45:58.120 align:start position:0%
the effect of a bill is that correct not
 
04:46:00.670 --> 04:46:00.680 align:start position:0%
as I see it it would be a the
 
04:46:02.708 --> 04:46:02.718 align:start position:0%
legislature stating its sense that
 
04:46:05.150 --> 04:46:05.160 align:start position:0%
Claremont was not a legitimate exercise
 
04:46:06.868 --> 04:46:06.878 align:start position:0%
of the judicial function and therefore
 
04:46:08.910 --> 04:46:08.920 align:start position:0%
is not binding on the legislature and
 
04:46:11.670 --> 04:46:11.680 align:start position:0%
the legislature thereby reasserts its
 
04:46:13.788 --> 04:46:13.798 align:start position:0%
own exclusive authority over the entire
 
04:46:15.910 --> 04:46:15.920 align:start position:0%
subject of the Claremont which is
 
04:46:19.830 --> 04:46:19.840 align:start position:0%
funding and of education and education
 
04:46:23.110 --> 04:46:23.120 align:start position:0%
policy yes follow up in your
 
04:46:25.070 --> 04:46:25.080 align:start position:0%
professional view what would be the
 
04:46:29.990 --> 04:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
consequence of um not following a house
 
04:46:33.270 --> 04:46:33.280 align:start position:0%
concurrent resolution of of a violation
 
04:46:35.510 --> 04:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
of a house concurrent resolution what
 
04:46:36.830 --> 04:46:36.840 align:start position:0%
would be the consequence of that
 
04:46:39.948 --> 04:46:39.958 align:start position:0%
violation by the house itself well by
 
04:46:43.350 --> 04:46:43.360 align:start position:0%
the C if if the court did not comply
 
04:46:46.510 --> 04:46:46.520 align:start position:0%
with the house resolution or did not as
 
04:46:48.470 --> 04:46:48.480 align:start position:0%
you you talked about
 
04:46:50.750 --> 04:46:50.760 align:start position:0%
repudiation what would be the
 
04:46:54.270 --> 04:46:54.280 align:start position:0%
consequence well we go back to Alexander
 
04:46:56.030 --> 04:46:56.040 align:start position:0%
Hamilton when he characterized the
 
04:46:57.628 --> 04:46:57.638 align:start position:0%
Judiciary as the weakest branch of
 
04:46:59.830 --> 04:46:59.840 align:start position:0%
government because it depends upon the
 
04:47:01.830 --> 04:47:01.840 align:start position:0%
legislative branch for its for its
 
04:47:04.150 --> 04:47:04.160 align:start position:0%
functioning they have to pay for its
 
04:47:05.470 --> 04:47:05.480 align:start position:0%
facilities and everything and they
 
04:47:07.390 --> 04:47:07.400 align:start position:0%
depend upon the executive branch for
 
04:47:09.830 --> 04:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
enforcing its orders all the all the
 
04:47:12.670 --> 04:47:12.680 align:start position:0%
judicial branch has going for it is
 
04:47:15.110 --> 04:47:15.120 align:start position:0%
Judgment so if the if the legislative
 
04:47:19.110 --> 04:47:19.120 align:start position:0%
branch through a solemn act like passing
 
04:47:22.110 --> 04:47:22.120 align:start position:0%
this this house concurrent resolution uh
 
04:47:24.470 --> 04:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
determines that this was not a
 
04:47:25.910 --> 04:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
legitimate exercise of the judicial
 
04:47:27.510 --> 04:47:27.520 align:start position:0%
function there's nothing the court can
 
04:47:28.470 --> 04:47:28.480 align:start position:0%
do about
 
04:47:31.708 --> 04:47:31.718 align:start position:0%
it you you hold the whip hand
 
04:47:34.030 --> 04:47:34.040 align:start position:0%
here I was constantly frustrated when I
 
04:47:35.230 --> 04:47:35.240 align:start position:0%
was here at the house that that the
 
04:47:38.548 --> 04:47:38.558 align:start position:0%
house and the Senate don't understand
 
04:47:41.430 --> 04:47:41.440 align:start position:0%
the extent of their Authority
 
04:47:44.430 --> 04:47:44.440 align:start position:0%
uh I was dismayed by the the amount of
 
04:47:48.390 --> 04:47:48.400 align:start position:0%
uh Authority that would be conceded to
 
04:47:50.510 --> 04:47:50.520 align:start position:0%
the Judiciary and would be delegated to
 
04:47:53.788 --> 04:47:53.798 align:start position:0%
the uh Executive Administrative agencies
 
04:47:56.310 --> 04:47:56.320 align:start position:0%
the the the legislature seems content to
 
04:48:01.270 --> 04:48:01.280 align:start position:0%
let other people us make an enforce
 
04:48:03.590 --> 04:48:03.600 align:start position:0%
policy other question of yes
 
04:48:03.600 --> 04:48:04.708 align:start position:0%
policy other question of yes
representative

04:48:04.708 --> 04:48:04.718 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:48:06.990 --> 04:48:07.000 align:start position:0%
pno thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
04:48:09.310 --> 04:48:09.320 align:start position:0%
for taking my question earlier we heard
 
04:48:12.110 --> 04:48:12.120 align:start position:0%
testimony that should the legislature
 
04:48:15.310 --> 04:48:15.320 align:start position:0%
resist the court the decisions of the
 
04:48:17.030 --> 04:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
court that that would weaken the
 
04:48:19.350 --> 04:48:19.360 align:start position:0%
legislature but it seems to me if I'm
 
04:48:22.350 --> 04:48:22.360 align:start position:0%
not mistaken that what you are saying is
 
04:48:25.590 --> 04:48:25.600 align:start position:0%
that resisting a court decision would
 
04:48:28.350 --> 04:48:28.360 align:start position:0%
strengthen the
 
04:48:31.070 --> 04:48:31.080 align:start position:0%
legislature I I've always felt that it
 
04:48:33.750 --> 04:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
would be a healthy thing if in an
 
04:48:35.270 --> 04:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
egregious case such as this the
 
04:48:37.190 --> 04:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
legislature were to repudiate the court
 
04:48:39.190 --> 04:48:39.200 align:start position:0%
because I think the court in the future
 
04:48:40.350 --> 04:48:40.360 align:start position:0%
would then pick its fights more
 
04:48:40.360 --> 04:48:41.390 align:start position:0%
would then pick its fights more
carefully

04:48:41.390 --> 04:48:41.400 align:start position:0%
carefully
 
04:48:43.270 --> 04:48:43.280 align:start position:0%
what the court did in 93 I believe is
 
04:48:44.510 --> 04:48:44.520 align:start position:0%
they just bit off a little more than
 
04:48:47.150 --> 04:48:47.160 align:start position:0%
they could chew I think during the 80s
 
04:48:48.750 --> 04:48:48.760 align:start position:0%
and early 90s there there was a series
 
04:48:50.750 --> 04:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
of cases the court seemed to be poking a
 
04:48:52.150 --> 04:48:52.160 align:start position:0%
stick at the legislature and I couldn't
 
04:48:56.030 --> 04:48:56.040 align:start position:0%
figure out why this was and
 
04:48:58.470 --> 04:48:58.480 align:start position:0%
uh you know I felt that it was like the
 
04:49:00.270 --> 04:49:00.280 align:start position:0%
court was testing the legislature to see
 
04:49:03.430 --> 04:49:03.440 align:start position:0%
how far it could go and when clarine
 
04:49:04.990 --> 04:49:05.000 align:start position:0%
came along it was it was like an aha
 
04:49:06.750 --> 04:49:06.760 align:start position:0%
moment to me they were they were setting
 
04:49:11.150 --> 04:49:11.160 align:start position:0%
us up for something like this where they
 
04:49:13.310 --> 04:49:13.320 align:start position:0%
made a major intrusion into a policy
 
04:49:16.070 --> 04:49:16.080 align:start position:0%
area and figured that the legislature is
 
04:49:17.470 --> 04:49:17.480 align:start position:0%
going to comply they didn't they didn't
 
04:49:18.910 --> 04:49:18.920 align:start position:0%
realize how much resistance there would
 
04:49:22.430 --> 04:49:22.440 align:start position:0%
be because they did not they did not
 
04:49:24.788 --> 04:49:24.798 align:start position:0%
understand how much we would cling to
 
04:49:27.788 --> 04:49:27.798 align:start position:0%
our desire to be an economical state
 
04:49:30.070 --> 04:49:30.080 align:start position:0%
where local control of education is very
 
04:49:31.948 --> 04:49:31.958 align:start position:0%
important that was what the Constitution
 
04:49:33.990 --> 04:49:34.000 align:start position:0%
intended regardless of what you may have
 
04:49:35.670 --> 04:49:35.680 align:start position:0%
heard from the previous witness that the
 
04:49:38.070 --> 04:49:38.080 align:start position:0%
the evidence is overwhelming uh the
 
04:49:40.350 --> 04:49:40.360 align:start position:0%
evidence cited by the court in in the
 
04:49:43.030 --> 04:49:43.040 align:start position:0%
clar decision was dishonest because it
 
04:49:45.548 --> 04:49:45.558 align:start position:0%
was because of what it didn't say it it
 
04:49:47.830 --> 04:49:47.840 align:start position:0%
took a few excerpts and speeches and
 
04:49:50.750 --> 04:49:50.760 align:start position:0%
letters which the the en thrust of them
 
04:49:53.510 --> 04:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
was that yes education's important but
 
04:49:56.150 --> 04:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
what really matters is what was actually
 
04:49:59.990 --> 04:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
done in legislation before during the
 
04:50:02.390 --> 04:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
Constitutional period and and afterwards
 
04:50:05.030 --> 04:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
and uh it's quite plain there was no
 
04:50:07.350 --> 04:50:07.360 align:start position:0%
State funding at all for Education until
 
04:50:07.360 --> 04:50:08.390 align:start position:0%
State funding at all for Education until
the

04:50:08.390 --> 04:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:50:11.830 --> 04:50:11.840 align:start position:0%
1850s but the court found that to be not
 
04:50:13.190 --> 04:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
convincing I don't know why that would
 
04:50:15.390 --> 04:50:15.400 align:start position:0%
be the very best evidence of what was
 
04:50:16.788 --> 04:50:16.798 align:start position:0%
the intention of the makers of the
 
04:50:18.670 --> 04:50:18.680 align:start position:0%
Constitution what what the legislators
 
04:50:20.830 --> 04:50:20.840 align:start position:0%
in the immediately preceding immediately
 
04:50:22.868 --> 04:50:22.878 align:start position:0%
following years actually did and they
 
04:50:24.470 --> 04:50:24.480 align:start position:0%
did not provide State funding for
 
04:50:26.310 --> 04:50:26.320 align:start position:0%
Education what they
 
04:50:28.990 --> 04:50:29.000 align:start position:0%
did article 83 working in conjunction
 
04:50:32.708 --> 04:50:32.718 align:start position:0%
with article six of part one is they
 
04:50:35.510 --> 04:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
directed the towns to provide education
 
04:50:36.948 --> 04:50:36.958 align:start position:0%
at the town's
 
04:50:39.750 --> 04:50:39.760 align:start position:0%
expense that was that was how article 83
 
04:50:41.830 --> 04:50:41.840 align:start position:0%
and article 6 work
 
04:50:43.868 --> 04:50:43.878 align:start position:0%
together other questions for this W
 
04:50:46.470 --> 04:50:46.480 align:start position:0%
representative Oregon um thank you very
 
04:50:48.110 --> 04:50:48.120 align:start position:0%
much I don't know whether you consider
 
04:50:49.910 --> 04:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
it's an extending circumstance or not
 
04:50:53.430 --> 04:50:53.440 align:start position:0%
but 1993 was uh 32 years ago so we're in
 
04:50:54.628 --> 04:50:54.638 align:start position:0%
I guess our
 
04:50:58.270 --> 04:50:58.280 align:start position:0%
16th uh B anual budget cycle since that
 
04:51:00.070 --> 04:51:00.080 align:start position:0%
decision came down and hasn't the
 
04:51:02.510 --> 04:51:02.520 align:start position:0%
legislator legislature
 
04:51:04.868 --> 04:51:04.878 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding judge Rua's hearings and
 
04:51:07.590 --> 04:51:07.600 align:start position:0%
various other ones um managed to get
 
04:51:09.750 --> 04:51:09.760 align:start position:0%
away with passing budgets every two
 
04:51:12.230 --> 04:51:12.240 align:start position:0%
years which provide a level of so-called
 
04:51:14.150 --> 04:51:14.160 align:start position:0%
adequacy that's far below what it
 
04:51:17.110 --> 04:51:17.120 align:start position:0%
actually cost to educate a student and
 
04:51:20.150 --> 04:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
um and without really an Ade and without
 
04:51:22.190 --> 04:51:22.200 align:start position:0%
an adequate Statewide funding so haven't
 
04:51:23.830 --> 04:51:23.840 align:start position:0%
we actually like got away with not
 
04:51:27.350 --> 04:51:27.360 align:start position:0%
funding education um according to the
 
04:51:29.230 --> 04:51:29.240 align:start position:0%
standards of the laws it was back in
 
04:51:33.030 --> 04:51:33.040 align:start position:0%
1993 so haven't we Haven we kind of like
 
04:51:34.590 --> 04:51:34.600 align:start position:0%
triumphed over the courts in this
 
04:51:36.070 --> 04:51:36.080 align:start position:0%
ongoing battle
 
04:51:38.750 --> 04:51:38.760 align:start position:0%
so well to me it's been like a rope adob
 
04:51:40.708 --> 04:51:40.718 align:start position:0%
strategy the the legislature has been
 
04:51:42.030 --> 04:51:42.040 align:start position:0%
state of denial over what the
 
04:51:45.350 --> 04:51:45.360 align:start position:0%
implications of Claremont one were and
 
04:51:48.070 --> 04:51:48.080 align:start position:0%
uh so they so the legislators yeah I
 
04:51:49.190 --> 04:51:49.200 align:start position:0%
don't know what was in the minds of my
 
04:51:50.548 --> 04:51:50.558 align:start position:0%
fellow legislators when they passed
 
04:51:52.110 --> 04:51:52.120 align:start position:0%
these bills whether they really honestly
 
04:51:53.788 --> 04:51:53.798 align:start position:0%
believe these complied with Claremont or
 
04:51:56.270 --> 04:51:56.280 align:start position:0%
they didn't but they to me they plainly
 
04:51:58.070 --> 04:51:58.080 align:start position:0%
didn't they but they would pretend they
 
04:51:59.868 --> 04:51:59.878 align:start position:0%
did and then that would just lead to
 
04:52:02.470 --> 04:52:02.480 align:start position:0%
another school funding suit and a little
 
04:52:04.948 --> 04:52:04.958 align:start position:0%
more cajoling from the court which as I
 
04:52:07.788 --> 04:52:07.798 align:start position:0%
said before gets them more and more into
 
04:52:10.350 --> 04:52:10.360 align:start position:0%
policymaking and then another bill comes
 
04:52:12.310 --> 04:52:12.320 align:start position:0%
that and then we end up where we are now
 
04:52:14.270 --> 04:52:14.280 align:start position:0%
where finally it's all come home to
 
04:52:16.070 --> 04:52:16.080 align:start position:0%
roost we have the conval decision where
 
04:52:18.990 --> 04:52:19.000 align:start position:0%
if it's if it's if it's upheld will
 
04:52:21.670 --> 04:52:21.680 align:start position:0%
result in a massive tax increase in this
 
04:52:25.750 --> 04:52:25.760 align:start position:0%
state to fund education according to the
 
04:52:28.190 --> 04:52:28.200 align:start position:0%
figure for adequacy that uh that judge
 
04:52:28.200 --> 04:52:29.708 align:start position:0%
figure for adequacy that uh that judge
ruoff

04:52:29.708 --> 04:52:29.718 align:start position:0%
ruoff
 
04:52:31.510 --> 04:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
determined so we can't so the
 
04:52:34.110 --> 04:52:34.120 align:start position:0%
legislature can't play around anymore
 
04:52:36.788 --> 04:52:36.798 align:start position:0%
followup yes but wouldn't it wouldn't it
 
04:52:38.910 --> 04:52:38.920 align:start position:0%
alternatively be within our powers I
 
04:52:40.590 --> 04:52:40.600 align:start position:0%
mean this would be an unpopular decision
 
04:52:43.708 --> 04:52:43.718 align:start position:0%
to be a lot of push back to just uh put
 
04:52:45.750 --> 04:52:45.760 align:start position:0%
through it a Max of tax increase which
 
04:52:47.270 --> 04:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
would hopefully would be offset at least
 
04:52:49.190 --> 04:52:49.200 align:start position:0%
to some extent by lower local property
 
04:52:51.190 --> 04:52:51.200 align:start position:0%
taxes and actually fund education
 
04:52:53.628 --> 04:52:53.638 align:start position:0%
adequately so isn't that an option
 
04:52:55.830 --> 04:52:55.840 align:start position:0%
that's uh before us this budget cycle I
 
04:52:57.350 --> 04:52:57.360 align:start position:0%
mean not the option that's likely to be
 
04:52:59.628 --> 04:52:59.638 align:start position:0%
taken but isn't that an option that
 
04:53:01.190 --> 04:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
faces the people down the hall who are
 
04:53:02.470 --> 04:53:02.480 align:start position:0%
writing the budget to actually go ahead
 
04:53:05.628 --> 04:53:05.638 align:start position:0%
and fund education adequacy and put this
 
04:53:07.990 --> 04:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
home and obviously increase taxes and
 
04:53:12.230 --> 04:53:12.240 align:start position:0%
put the man to rest that way well I
 
04:53:13.788 --> 04:53:13.798 align:start position:0%
I'm just getting a personal opinion here
 
04:53:15.990 --> 04:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
I think the the appetite of the schools
 
04:53:18.510 --> 04:53:18.520 align:start position:0%
for money is just Limitless so any tax
 
04:53:21.030 --> 04:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
you you made would never be enough and I
 
04:53:22.590 --> 04:53:22.600 align:start position:0%
and I'll tell you also I grew up in
 
04:53:24.750 --> 04:53:24.760 align:start position:0%
Illinois and I remember very clearly
 
04:53:26.510 --> 04:53:26.520 align:start position:0%
that in the late
 
04:53:29.708 --> 04:53:29.718 align:start position:0%
60s the the voters were sold on a state
 
04:53:31.708 --> 04:53:31.718 align:start position:0%
income tax on the promise that it would
 
04:53:33.670 --> 04:53:33.680 align:start position:0%
reduce property taxes and and I'm sure
 
04:53:35.150 --> 04:53:35.160 align:start position:0%
it did for a couple years but then
 
04:53:36.590 --> 04:53:36.600 align:start position:0%
pretty soon they're both right back
 
04:53:38.670 --> 04:53:38.680 align:start position:0%
where the the property tax are right
 
04:53:39.948 --> 04:53:39.958 align:start position:0%
back where they were and and then you
 
04:53:41.470 --> 04:53:41.480 align:start position:0%
have an income tax and I and I think
 
04:53:43.030 --> 04:53:43.040 align:start position:0%
that's the way the income tax has been
 
04:53:44.868 --> 04:53:44.878 align:start position:0%
sold in a lot of
 
04:53:47.150 --> 04:53:47.160 align:start position:0%
states the promise that property taxes
 
04:53:49.310 --> 04:53:49.320 align:start position:0%
would be lowered and it just doesn't
 
04:53:51.270 --> 04:53:51.280 align:start position:0%
work out that way in the long
 
04:53:56.510 --> 04:53:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:00.628 --> 04:54:00.638 align:start position:0%
Smith trying not to ask a question
 
04:54:04.150 --> 04:54:04.160 align:start position:0%
um is your
 
04:54:07.270 --> 04:54:07.280 align:start position:0%
concern that you believe that the
 
04:54:12.628 --> 04:54:12.638 align:start position:0%
judicial branch has over stepped its
 
04:54:15.390 --> 04:54:15.400 align:start position:0%
boundaries or is your
 
04:54:21.070 --> 04:54:21.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:23.270 --> 04:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
um the
 
04:54:25.990 --> 04:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
monster that some people think it is of
 
04:54:30.230 --> 04:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
an income tax would be the only way for
 
04:54:33.430 --> 04:54:33.440 align:start position:0%
the state to in fact meet its
 
04:54:36.070 --> 04:54:36.080 align:start position:0%
obligation to fund
 
04:54:38.390 --> 04:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
education I I very much appreciate that
 
04:54:39.510 --> 04:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
question because this something I would
 
04:54:40.868 --> 04:54:40.878 align:start position:0%
have liked to have said and I should
 
04:54:42.830 --> 04:54:42.840 align:start position:0%
have said at the outside as far as
 
04:54:44.670 --> 04:54:44.680 align:start position:0%
education policy is concerned I'm just
 
04:54:47.868 --> 04:54:47.878 align:start position:0%
agnostic my my I've seen my role in this
 
04:54:51.190 --> 04:54:51.200 align:start position:0%
as being to reset who makes the policy I
 
04:54:52.948 --> 04:54:52.958 align:start position:0%
don't want the judicial branch setting
 
04:54:55.270 --> 04:54:55.280 align:start position:0%
education policy when the judicial
 
04:54:57.390 --> 04:54:57.400 align:start position:0%
branch engages in judicial truly
 
04:54:59.830 --> 04:54:59.840 align:start position:0%
judicial acts I'm a great admirer we are
 
04:55:01.270 --> 04:55:01.280 align:start position:0%
very lucky to live in the state and and
 
04:55:03.990 --> 04:55:04.000 align:start position:0%
we have a very good Judiciary but back
 
04:55:06.230 --> 04:55:06.240 align:start position:0%
in 19993 they went off the rails in this
 
04:55:09.788 --> 04:55:09.798 align:start position:0%
one case and I just wanted to restore
 
04:55:11.910 --> 04:55:11.920 align:start position:0%
education funding policy and decision
 
04:55:14.430 --> 04:55:14.440 align:start position:0%
making to where it belongs but as far as
 
04:55:14.440 --> 04:55:15.230 align:start position:0%
making to where it belongs but as far as
what

04:55:15.230 --> 04:55:15.240 align:start position:0%
what
 
04:55:18.110 --> 04:55:18.120 align:start position:0%
policy the legisl in this wisdom decides
 
04:55:20.310 --> 04:55:20.320 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm
 
04:55:22.788 --> 04:55:22.798 align:start position:0%
neutral I'm a process guy in other words
 
04:55:24.390 --> 04:55:24.400 align:start position:0%
not a policy
 
04:55:27.830 --> 04:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
guy other questions for this
 
04:55:31.150 --> 04:55:31.160 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you very much
 
04:55:33.628 --> 04:55:33.638 align:start position:0%
I'd like submit Mr chairman I'd like to

absolutely that's
 
04:55:41.548 --> 04:55:41.558 align:start position:0%
fine um next I'm going to call Zak Shen
 
04:55:47.350 --> 04:55:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:49.750 --> 04:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
please thank you very much nice see
 
04:55:51.670 --> 04:55:51.680 align:start position:0%
thank you good to see
 
04:55:54.590 --> 04:55:54.600 align:start position:0%
you good afternoon uh members of the
 
04:55:57.110 --> 04:55:57.120 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Zach shien I'm the
 
04:55:59.230 --> 04:55:59.240 align:start position:0%
executive director of the New Hampshire
 
04:56:01.470 --> 04:56:01.480 align:start position:0%
school funding fairness project um I
 
04:56:02.990 --> 04:56:03.000 align:start position:0%
have some testimony I can pass out offer
 
04:56:04.430 --> 04:56:04.440 align:start position:0%
and will try not to repeat what's
 
04:56:05.470 --> 04:56:05.480 align:start position:0%
already been said I know we've been
 
04:56:08.150 --> 04:56:08.160 align:start position:0%
going for a bit here um but a little bit
 
04:56:10.390 --> 04:56:10.400 align:start position:0%
more context around um we're in
 
04:56:13.948 --> 04:56:13.958 align:start position:0%
opposition to both uh hcr1 and and HCR 7
 
04:56:17.628 --> 04:56:17.638 align:start position:0%
which will be heard uh next um I think
 
04:56:18.830 --> 04:56:18.840 align:start position:0%
it's important to provide a little more
 
04:56:21.190 --> 04:56:21.200 align:start position:0%
context around kind of why the Claremont
 
04:56:22.708 --> 04:56:22.718 align:start position:0%
lawsuits were initially filed and why
 
04:56:24.670 --> 04:56:24.680 align:start position:0%
we've had ongoing lawsuits over the
 
04:56:26.510 --> 04:56:26.520 align:start position:0%
years have been referenced throughout
 
04:56:29.030 --> 04:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
the hearing uh today uh currently
 
04:56:31.310 --> 04:56:31.320 align:start position:0%
there's a gap between what the state has
 
04:56:33.910 --> 04:56:33.920 align:start position:0%
determined to be the cost of an adequate
 
04:56:36.868 --> 04:56:36.878 align:start position:0%
education uh averages out about
 
04:56:39.230 --> 04:56:39.240 align:start position:0%
$5,295 per student that's current
 
04:56:42.230 --> 04:56:42.240 align:start position:0%
figures um when're actual expenditures
 
04:56:43.990 --> 04:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
um average expenditures across the state
 
04:56:45.270 --> 04:56:45.280 align:start position:0%
are closer to
 
04:56:47.990 --> 04:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
$22,000 per student this average
 
04:56:49.910 --> 04:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
expenditures there's no school district
 
04:56:52.788 --> 04:56:52.798 align:start position:0%
in the state that spends less than three
 
04:56:54.830 --> 04:56:54.840 align:start position:0%
times the amount of funding that they're
 
04:56:56.830 --> 04:56:56.840 align:start position:0%
getting from the state in adequacy
 
04:57:00.190 --> 04:57:00.200 align:start position:0%
funding um that is the same context
 
04:57:01.750 --> 04:57:01.760 align:start position:0%
under which The Claremont lawsuits were
 
04:57:04.590 --> 04:57:04.600 align:start position:0%
filed significant lack of funding from
 
04:57:06.868 --> 04:57:06.878 align:start position:0%
the state to provide these services to
 
04:57:09.590 --> 04:57:09.600 align:start position:0%
school districts in specific communities
 
04:57:12.990 --> 04:57:13.000 align:start position:0%
with lower property tax um rates and and
 
04:57:14.548 --> 04:57:14.558 align:start position:0%
higher property tax
 
04:57:17.350 --> 04:57:17.360 align:start position:0%
burdens only 20% of all School District
 
04:57:19.030 --> 04:57:19.040 align:start position:0%
Revenue actually comes from the state of
 
04:57:20.910 --> 04:57:20.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that's the smallest share
 
04:57:23.470 --> 04:57:23.480 align:start position:0%
in the entire country uh whereas we rely
 
04:57:26.270 --> 04:57:26.280 align:start position:0%
on 70% about comes from property
 
04:57:28.750 --> 04:57:28.760 align:start position:0%
taxpayers which is the largest share of
 
04:57:29.948 --> 04:57:29.958 align:start position:0%
school district Revenue that comes from
 
04:57:32.430 --> 04:57:32.440 align:start position:0%
property taxes uh by a long shot uh in
 
04:57:34.868 --> 04:57:34.878 align:start position:0%
the country uh these resolutions um
 
04:57:36.948 --> 04:57:36.958 align:start position:0%
really are going to entrench more of the
 
04:57:40.470 --> 04:57:40.480 align:start position:0%
disparities right these are statements
 
04:57:42.830 --> 04:57:42.840 align:start position:0%
um that are looking to push back on the
 
04:57:44.390 --> 04:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
rulings have been made we've heard a lot
 
04:57:46.310 --> 04:57:46.320 align:start position:0%
about that and to the some of the
 
04:57:48.670 --> 04:57:48.680 align:start position:0%
conversation earlier um the legislature
 
04:57:52.390 --> 04:57:52.400 align:start position:0%
has to date not been um passing budgets
 
04:57:55.670 --> 04:57:55.680 align:start position:0%
or policy that has moved towards um The
 
04:57:58.030 --> 04:57:58.040 align:start position:0%
Claremont rulings which is why there are
 
04:58:00.470 --> 04:58:00.480 align:start position:0%
continued lawsuits there are continued
 
04:58:02.110 --> 04:58:02.120 align:start position:0%
lawsuits because there continues to be a
 
04:58:03.948 --> 04:58:03.958 align:start position:0%
lack of funding from the state that
 
04:58:06.190 --> 04:58:06.200 align:start position:0%
provides an adequate opportunity for an
 
04:58:07.910 --> 04:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
adequate education to every school
 
04:58:12.070 --> 04:58:12.080 align:start position:0%
district in the state
 
04:58:14.270 --> 04:58:14.280 align:start position:0%
the court um to go back to the the kind
 
04:58:16.390 --> 04:58:16.400 align:start position:0%
of conval rulings the court has been
 
04:58:17.868 --> 04:58:17.878 align:start position:0%
very clear and when they were
 
04:58:19.510 --> 04:58:19.520 align:start position:0%
deliberating you know when the court
 
04:58:21.110 --> 04:58:21.120 align:start position:0%
case got remanded back down to the
 
04:58:23.390 --> 04:58:23.400 align:start position:0%
Superior Court to judge ruof he was very
 
04:58:25.868 --> 04:58:25.878 align:start position:0%
clear in thinking through what is my
 
04:58:30.310 --> 04:58:30.320 align:start position:0%
role here in this debate if I say that
 
04:58:33.150 --> 04:58:33.160 align:start position:0%
the $4,100 at the time in base adequacy
 
04:58:34.708 --> 04:58:34.718 align:start position:0%
right that's the amount of money just
 
04:58:37.510 --> 04:58:37.520 align:start position:0%
for the the bare minimum that providing
 
04:58:40.070 --> 04:58:40.080 align:start position:0%
for base adequacy for Education if the
 
04:58:42.548 --> 04:58:42.558 align:start position:0%
$4,100 of state's providing is not
 
04:58:44.190 --> 04:58:44.200 align:start position:0%
enough but I've been told by the Supreme
 
04:58:45.910 --> 04:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
Court to come back with a number and I
 
04:58:49.030 --> 04:58:49.040 align:start position:0%
say it's 4101 right that wouldn't
 
04:58:51.990 --> 04:58:52.000 align:start position:0%
material materially change anything the
 
04:58:53.230 --> 04:58:53.240 align:start position:0%
lwuit would probably turn around and
 
04:58:55.430 --> 04:58:55.440 align:start position:0%
come right back a dollar increase is not
 
04:58:57.390 --> 04:58:57.400 align:start position:0%
going to change anything and so he was
 
04:58:59.590 --> 04:58:59.600 align:start position:0%
very clear in his ruling and this is
 
04:59:03.830 --> 04:59:03.840 align:start position:0%
about base adequacy only that the 7356
 
04:59:06.110 --> 04:59:06.120 align:start position:0%
um figure that he came up with was a
 
04:59:08.310 --> 04:59:08.320 align:start position:0%
minimum and that it was the legislator's
 
04:59:10.310 --> 04:59:10.320 align:start position:0%
job to go and figure out what the actual
 
04:59:13.510 --> 04:59:13.520 align:start position:0%
number is um actual cost of an adequate
 
04:59:16.430 --> 04:59:16.440 align:start position:0%
education but that should be the floor
 
04:59:18.830 --> 04:59:18.840 align:start position:0%
given that the floor of $4,100 was not
 
04:59:21.310 --> 04:59:21.320 align:start position:0%
nearly enough um this would be a shift
 
04:59:24.430 --> 04:59:24.440 align:start position:0%
of close to $500 million the order does
 
04:59:27.230 --> 04:59:27.240 align:start position:0%
not say to increase funding by $500
 
04:59:30.030 --> 04:59:30.040 align:start position:0%
million it could and should be a shift
 
04:59:31.948 --> 04:59:31.958 align:start position:0%
of who is paying for that from local
 
04:59:35.310 --> 04:59:35.320 align:start position:0%
property taxpayers to the state relative
 
04:59:37.310 --> 04:59:37.320 align:start position:0%
to judicial overreach which I think is
 
04:59:38.948 --> 04:59:38.958 align:start position:0%
what was testified as kind of the
 
04:59:41.708 --> 04:59:41.718 align:start position:0%
impetus for for this um concurrent
 
04:59:43.830 --> 04:59:43.840 align:start position:0%
resolution um there's been a lot of
 
04:59:46.430 --> 04:59:46.440 align:start position:0%
suggesting um judicial overreach uh
 
04:59:49.070 --> 04:59:49.080 align:start position:0%
judge ruof again um address those
 
04:59:51.590 --> 04:59:51.600 align:start position:0%
potential concerns in his conval ruling
 
04:59:52.990 --> 04:59:53.000 align:start position:0%
and I'll just read a quick quote from
 
04:59:55.470 --> 04:59:55.480 align:start position:0%
him this a quote from the conval ruling
 
04:59:57.150 --> 04:59:57.160 align:start position:0%
the court is likewise cognizant that
 
04:59:58.990 --> 04:59:59.000 align:start position:0%
school funding is a complicated and
 
05:00:01.070 --> 05:00:01.080 align:start position:0%
politically charged issue with a history
 
05:00:02.788 --> 05:00:02.798 align:start position:0%
that suggests some level of judicial
 
05:00:04.990 --> 05:00:05.000 align:start position:0%
intervention is now necessary among
 
05:00:06.270 --> 05:00:06.280 align:start position:0%
other things though the legislature
 
05:00:08.510 --> 05:00:08.520 align:start position:0%
hired Dr Baker to analyze school funding
 
05:00:10.110 --> 05:00:10.120 align:start position:0%
issues and provide an informed
 
05:00:12.190 --> 05:00:12.200 align:start position:0%
recommendation based adequacy Aid is
 
05:00:13.788 --> 05:00:13.798 align:start position:0%
currently funded at less than half of
 
05:00:15.830 --> 05:00:15.840 align:start position:0%
his recommended levels this is just one
 
05:00:17.590 --> 05:00:17.600 align:start position:0%
example that calls into question whether
 
05:00:20.030 --> 05:00:20.040 align:start position:0%
the politics of this issue are impeding
 
05:00:21.910 --> 05:00:21.920 align:start position:0%
the state's constitutional obligation to
 
05:00:25.110 --> 05:00:25.120 align:start position:0%
fully fund fully fund the opportunity
 
05:00:26.270 --> 05:00:26.280 align:start position:0%
for children in the state to receive an
 
05:00:28.310 --> 05:00:28.320 align:start position:0%
adequate education end quote so there's
 
05:00:30.830 --> 05:00:30.840 align:start position:0%
a recognition there that and this was
 
05:00:33.628 --> 05:00:33.638 align:start position:0%
brought up earlier we have Decades of
 
05:00:35.910 --> 05:00:35.920 align:start position:0%
legislature making some changes to
 
05:00:38.190 --> 05:00:38.200 align:start position:0%
school funding law and then court cases
 
05:00:39.510 --> 05:00:39.520 align:start position:0%
coming back saying you're still not
 
05:00:41.350 --> 05:00:41.360 align:start position:0%
providing enough in based adequacy
 
05:00:42.830 --> 05:00:42.840 align:start position:0%
there's a heavy Reliance on local
 
05:00:45.230 --> 05:00:45.240 align:start position:0%
property taxes the legisl making some
 
05:00:47.270 --> 05:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
changes but not enough and more court
 
05:00:49.270 --> 05:00:49.280 align:start position:0%
cases and he's addressing that there's
 
05:00:51.670 --> 05:00:51.680 align:start position:0%
the political element of this issue
 
05:00:51.680 --> 05:00:52.430 align:start position:0%
the political element of this issue
might

05:00:52.430 --> 05:00:52.440 align:start position:0%
might
 
05:00:55.270 --> 05:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
be and in our bin also is what is
 
05:00:57.708 --> 05:00:57.718 align:start position:0%
holding this from moving forward um so
 
05:01:01.830 --> 05:01:01.840 align:start position:0%
hgr you know 11 is we should be spending
 
05:01:04.230 --> 05:01:04.240 align:start position:0%
time working on a solution to our school
 
05:01:07.030 --> 05:01:07.040 align:start position:0%
funding problem relieving property tax
 
05:01:08.990 --> 05:01:09.000 align:start position:0%
relieving the burden on property taxes
 
05:01:10.310 --> 05:01:10.320 align:start position:0%
sending more funding to the districts
 
05:01:12.070 --> 05:01:12.080 align:start position:0%
that need it most we know how to do that
 
05:01:15.470 --> 05:01:15.480 align:start position:0%
there's many policy mechanisms not
 
05:01:17.110 --> 05:01:17.120 align:start position:0%
having the legislature dig their heels
 
05:01:19.270 --> 05:01:19.280 align:start position:0%
in more I'll end with one last point I'm
 
05:01:20.910 --> 05:01:20.920 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions we've
 
05:01:22.030 --> 05:01:22.040 align:start position:0%
heard a lot about kind of what
 
05:01:23.910 --> 05:01:23.920 align:start position:0%
constituents and people want on this
 
05:01:26.708 --> 05:01:26.718 align:start position:0%
issue um just to you know forther record
 
05:01:29.750 --> 05:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
um the you know online signin for hcr1
 
05:01:31.990 --> 05:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
there's 19 folks in support and as of a
 
05:01:35.110 --> 05:01:35.120 align:start position:0%
few minuts ago 438 opposed and then
 
05:01:38.270 --> 05:01:38.280 align:start position:0%
seven uh H 7 three in support and 400
 
05:01:40.510 --> 05:01:40.520 align:start position:0%
against um just a measure of you know
 
05:01:42.350 --> 05:01:42.360 align:start position:0%
kind of how other folks are weighing on
 
05:01:44.110 --> 05:01:44.120 align:start position:0%
this issue and I'm happy to answer any
 
05:01:47.310 --> 05:01:47.320 align:start position:0%
questions question representative
 
05:01:50.310 --> 05:01:50.320 align:start position:0%
Oregon um actually I was doing some
 
05:01:52.830 --> 05:01:52.840 align:start position:0%
quick calculations with the c oh I'm I'm
 
05:01:54.110 --> 05:01:54.120 align:start position:0%
sorry I thought you had your hand up if
 
05:01:56.548 --> 05:01:56.558 align:start position:0%
I oh oh I guess I will ask a question um
 
05:01:58.230 --> 05:01:58.240 align:start position:0%
do you have a figure why not maybe you
 
05:01:59.590 --> 05:01:59.600 align:start position:0%
don't have this off the top of your head
 
05:02:01.070 --> 05:02:01.080 align:start position:0%
but do you have a figure on like how
 
05:02:03.708 --> 05:02:03.718 align:start position:0%
much you spent in total on public
 
05:02:05.868 --> 05:02:05.878 align:start position:0%
education in the
 
05:02:09.270 --> 05:02:09.280 align:start position:0%
state total expenditures from everyone
 
05:02:11.590 --> 05:02:11.600 align:start position:0%
are just the State um yeah both the
 
05:02:13.628 --> 05:02:13.638 align:start position:0%
state and the school districts I think
 
05:02:15.150 --> 05:02:15.160 align:start position:0%
the most recent figure is we spent about
 
05:02:17.548 --> 05:02:17.558 align:start position:0%
$4 billion all in in our public
 
05:02:20.230 --> 05:02:20.240 align:start position:0%
education system here in the state and
 
05:02:22.190 --> 05:02:22.200 align:start position:0%
you're showing my top of the head math
 
05:02:23.788 --> 05:02:23.798 align:start position:0%
20% of that is what's coming from the
 
05:02:25.830 --> 05:02:25.840 align:start position:0%
state I'm don't have that top okay good
 
05:02:28.110 --> 05:02:28.120 align:start position:0%
thanks yeah other questions for this W
 
05:02:29.628 --> 05:02:29.638 align:start position:0%
yes representative Alexander and then
 
05:02:29.638 --> 05:02:30.708 align:start position:0%
yes representative Alexander and then
representative

05:02:30.708 --> 05:02:30.718 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:02:32.750 --> 05:02:32.760 align:start position:0%
petno thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
05:02:33.948 --> 05:02:33.958 align:start position:0%
taking my question do you does your
 
05:02:35.830 --> 05:02:35.840 align:start position:0%
organization have any evidence to show
 
05:02:38.310 --> 05:02:38.320 align:start position:0%
that increased school funding will
 
05:02:40.910 --> 05:02:40.920 align:start position:0%
increase student outcome comes
 
05:02:43.030 --> 05:02:43.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely there is a huge body of
 
05:02:44.270 --> 05:02:44.280 align:start position:0%
evidence what you're referring to is
 
05:02:46.230 --> 05:02:46.240 align:start position:0%
this question of does money matter
 
05:02:47.708 --> 05:02:47.718 align:start position:0%
that's kind of the lingo that's used
 
05:02:49.510 --> 05:02:49.520 align:start position:0%
relative to researching what is the
 
05:02:52.150 --> 05:02:52.160 align:start position:0%
impact on funding uh on outcomes and
 
05:02:53.590 --> 05:02:53.600 align:start position:0%
there's a huge body of research that
 
05:02:56.548 --> 05:02:56.558 align:start position:0%
shows that more funding not just you
 
05:02:58.830 --> 05:02:58.840 align:start position:0%
know more funding everywhere for
 
05:03:00.510 --> 05:03:00.520 align:start position:0%
everyone without um cause for
 
05:03:02.310 --> 05:03:02.320 align:start position:0%
circumstances but we know that
 
05:03:03.788 --> 05:03:03.798 align:start position:0%
increasing funding especially for
 
05:03:05.190 --> 05:03:05.200 align:start position:0%
communities that have higher um
 
05:03:06.910 --> 05:03:06.920 align:start position:0%
proportions of students coming from low
 
05:03:09.310 --> 05:03:09.320 align:start position:0%
backgrounds um have higher proportion of
 
05:03:11.390 --> 05:03:11.400 align:start position:0%
students um who have disabilities
 
05:03:13.150 --> 05:03:13.160 align:start position:0%
there's plenty of evidence that shows
 
05:03:15.990 --> 05:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
that that does have a positive impact on
 
05:03:17.788 --> 05:03:17.798 align:start position:0%
student outcomes on Student Success
 
05:03:19.310 --> 05:03:19.320 align:start position:0%
rates graduation rates kind of whatever
 
05:03:21.390 --> 05:03:21.400 align:start position:0%
metric you'd like to use um there's
 
05:03:22.910 --> 05:03:22.920 align:start position:0%
plenty of evidence that shows that both
 
05:03:24.910 --> 05:03:24.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh and nationally and it's
 
05:03:26.590 --> 05:03:26.600 align:start position:0%
the does money matter is kind of the
 
05:03:28.990 --> 05:03:29.000 align:start position:0%
framing um that's used to answer that
 
05:03:31.910 --> 05:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
question representative
 
05:03:34.150 --> 05:03:34.160 align:start position:0%
pno thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
05:03:36.230 --> 05:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so I've been
 
05:03:38.310 --> 05:03:38.320 align:start position:0%
watching with interest as school
 
05:03:40.270 --> 05:03:40.280 align:start position:0%
districts across the state have been
 
05:03:43.470 --> 05:03:43.480 align:start position:0%
increasing their budgets in particular
 
05:03:46.350 --> 05:03:46.360 align:start position:0%
um this year I know our own my own local
 
05:03:48.350 --> 05:03:48.360 align:start position:0%
school district the budget is increasing
 
05:03:48.360 --> 05:03:49.350 align:start position:0%
school district the budget is increasing
by

05:03:49.350 --> 05:03:49.360 align:start position:0%
by
 
05:03:52.110 --> 05:03:52.120 align:start position:0%
8.67% and my question to you is wouldn't
 
05:03:54.390 --> 05:03:54.400 align:start position:0%
increasing adequacy just encourage the
 
05:03:56.670 --> 05:03:56.680 align:start position:0%
school districts to spend even more
 
05:03:59.070 --> 05:03:59.080 align:start position:0%
because they can just if we are getting
 
05:04:00.628 --> 05:04:00.638 align:start position:0%
now they're now getting more money from
 
05:04:03.510 --> 05:04:03.520 align:start position:0%
the state now they can offset and raise
 
05:04:05.548 --> 05:04:05.558 align:start position:0%
the local property taxes they just keep
 
05:04:08.190 --> 05:04:08.200 align:start position:0%
seem to keep raising their
 
05:04:10.830 --> 05:04:10.840 align:start position:0%
budgets I think what's interesting about
 
05:04:13.470 --> 05:04:13.480 align:start position:0%
budgets going up is it's a reflection of
 
05:04:16.030 --> 05:04:16.040 align:start position:0%
true costs but right now I'm not sure
 
05:04:17.150 --> 05:04:17.160 align:start position:0%
what community you live in off the top
 
05:04:19.270 --> 05:04:19.280 align:start position:0%
of my head I apologize but um the
 
05:04:20.390 --> 05:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
community you live in and and many
 
05:04:22.230 --> 05:04:22.240 align:start position:0%
others around the state that are that
 
05:04:24.548 --> 05:04:24.558 align:start position:0%
are proposing and passing increased
 
05:04:26.510 --> 05:04:26.520 align:start position:0%
State budgets who's paying for that is
 
05:04:28.310 --> 05:04:28.320 align:start position:0%
local property taxpayers so you're
 
05:04:31.788 --> 05:04:31.798 align:start position:0%
having very local very specific debates
 
05:04:34.150 --> 05:04:34.160 align:start position:0%
and conversations about if we increase
 
05:04:37.230 --> 05:04:37.240 align:start position:0%
this now 8 you know something percent we
 
05:04:38.948 --> 05:04:38.958 align:start position:0%
are going to pay for pretty much all of
 
05:04:41.110 --> 05:04:41.120 align:start position:0%
that and that's passing from our
 
05:04:43.030 --> 05:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
perspective that shows New Hampshire as
 
05:04:44.788 --> 05:04:44.798 align:start position:0%
a whole we have a deep commitment to our
 
05:04:46.948 --> 05:04:46.958 align:start position:0%
public education system even when we are
 
05:04:49.030 --> 05:04:49.040 align:start position:0%
the ones footing the bill as property
 
05:04:51.390 --> 05:04:51.400 align:start position:0%
taxpayers we are willing to invest and
 
05:04:53.788 --> 05:04:53.798 align:start position:0%
continue to invest in our communities
 
05:04:56.190 --> 05:04:56.200 align:start position:0%
the Nuance there is not every Community
 
05:04:58.190 --> 05:04:58.200 align:start position:0%
can do that some communities are
 
05:05:00.510 --> 05:05:00.520 align:start position:0%
proposing 8% increase and their property
 
05:05:01.910 --> 05:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
tax payers are paying rates that are
 
05:05:04.430 --> 05:05:04.440 align:start position:0%
three or four h times the rate of their
 
05:05:06.430 --> 05:05:06.440 align:start position:0%
neighbors and that they don't have that
 
05:05:08.750 --> 05:05:08.760 align:start position:0%
choice to say should we increase our our
 
05:05:10.270 --> 05:05:10.280 align:start position:0%
budget to
 
05:05:11.830 --> 05:05:11.840 align:start position:0%
you know increase the teacher pay or
 
05:05:14.750 --> 05:05:14.760 align:start position:0%
whatever it is and so from our
 
05:05:16.910 --> 05:05:16.920 align:start position:0%
perspective and I think there's evidence
 
05:05:18.390 --> 05:05:18.400 align:start position:0%
to show this from when swept the
 
05:05:20.510 --> 05:05:20.520 align:start position:0%
Statewide education property tax was
 
05:05:23.750 --> 05:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
passed in 1999 it was an additive a new
 
05:05:26.708 --> 05:05:26.718 align:start position:0%
additive tax at $6.60 right brand new
 
05:05:28.270 --> 05:05:28.280 align:start position:0%
property tax around the
 
05:05:31.150 --> 05:05:31.160 align:start position:0%
state paired with an education funding
 
05:05:32.670 --> 05:05:32.680 align:start position:0%
formula to the previous question where
 
05:05:34.430 --> 05:05:34.440 align:start position:0%
money was directed towards communities
 
05:05:37.708 --> 05:05:37.718 align:start position:0%
with highest need you added a 660 tax
 
05:05:39.590 --> 05:05:39.600 align:start position:0%
rate to everyone's Bill the average
 
05:05:42.590 --> 05:05:42.600 align:start position:0%
average property tax rate dropped $4 per
 
05:05:45.350 --> 05:05:45.360 align:start position:0%
thousand in the state and that's because
 
05:05:46.910 --> 05:05:46.920 align:start position:0%
when you gave more funding to
 
05:05:48.670 --> 05:05:48.680 align:start position:0%
communities that were really struggling
 
05:05:50.270 --> 05:05:50.280 align:start position:0%
with their property taxes sure they
 
05:05:51.230 --> 05:05:51.240 align:start position:0%
might have increased their spending
 
05:05:52.670 --> 05:05:52.680 align:start position:0%
their budgets a little bit but they pass
 
05:05:55.110 --> 05:05:55.120 align:start position:0%
a lot of that onto property tax savings
 
05:05:56.390 --> 05:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
and with that comes back to the local
 
05:05:58.548 --> 05:05:58.558 align:start position:0%
control issue of if districts have more
 
05:05:59.750 --> 05:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
funding from the state they have the
 
05:06:02.190 --> 05:06:02.200 align:start position:0%
ability to make those decisions locally
 
05:06:04.510 --> 05:06:04.520 align:start position:0%
and we saw that in 1999 where a large
 
05:06:06.628 --> 05:06:06.638 align:start position:0%
infusion of new cash with a new property
 
05:06:08.868 --> 05:06:08.878 align:start position:0%
tax result in many communities the ones
 
05:06:10.110 --> 05:06:10.120 align:start position:0%
that struggled the
 
05:06:11.510 --> 05:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
passing those savings directly on their
 
05:06:14.270 --> 05:06:14.280 align:start position:0%
property taxpayers I hope that was
 
05:06:19.310 --> 05:06:19.320 align:start position:0%
helpful other question yes go ahead
 
05:06:21.350 --> 05:06:21.360 align:start position:0%
representa yes thank you chair and thank
 
05:06:22.948 --> 05:06:22.958 align:start position:0%
you for the question so I was just
 
05:06:25.868 --> 05:06:25.878 align:start position:0%
looking at some facts here about the
 
05:06:28.590 --> 05:06:28.600 align:start position:0%
Department of Education uh the US
 
05:06:30.830 --> 05:06:30.840 align:start position:0%
Department not the local one here the
 
05:06:34.150 --> 05:06:34.160 align:start position:0%
year 2000 it was $33 billion of outlays
 
05:06:36.990 --> 05:06:37.000 align:start position:0%
4,900 employees last
 
05:06:40.270 --> 05:06:40.280 align:start position:0%
year went from the 33 billion 25 years
 
05:06:44.750 --> 05:06:44.760 align:start position:0%
ago to 251 billion only 4,200 employees
 
05:06:47.990 --> 05:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
now um how how much of the funding comes
 
05:06:49.990 --> 05:06:50.000 align:start position:0%
from federal
 
05:06:51.948 --> 05:06:51.958 align:start position:0%
government so just to clarify your
 
05:06:53.150 --> 05:06:53.160 align:start position:0%
question your question is how much of
 
05:06:55.070 --> 05:06:55.080 align:start position:0%
the funding of the four billion I
 
05:06:56.750 --> 05:06:56.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned to the total funding in New
 
05:06:57.948 --> 05:06:57.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire comes from the federal
 
05:07:01.310 --> 05:07:01.320 align:start position:0%
government uh 9% this year um we expect
 
05:07:03.030 --> 05:07:03.040 align:start position:0%
that to be it's normally around five or
 
05:07:05.750 --> 05:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
6% the past four years it's been much
 
05:07:07.390 --> 05:07:07.400 align:start position:0%
higher because of covid related funds
 
05:07:10.510 --> 05:07:10.520 align:start position:0%
but we'll see that drop off um in in F
 
05:07:12.670 --> 05:07:12.680 align:start position:0%
in the next the next year so we're we're
 
05:07:14.548 --> 05:07:14.558 align:start position:0%
expect we're peeking out right about 9%
 
05:07:16.910 --> 05:07:16.920 align:start position:0%
of of total education spending is coming
 
05:07:18.310 --> 05:07:18.320 align:start position:0%
from the federal
 
05:07:20.270 --> 05:07:20.280 align:start position:0%
government other questions for this
 
05:07:22.430 --> 05:07:22.440 align:start position:0%
witness do you have a followup go ahead
 
05:07:25.590 --> 05:07:25.600 align:start position:0%
yeah a follow-up question is if whereas
 
05:07:27.510 --> 05:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
if you've seen the news lately the uh
 
05:07:30.070 --> 05:07:30.080 align:start position:0%
doe at the federal level is on The
 
05:07:32.310 --> 05:07:32.320 align:start position:0%
Chopping Block so to speak uh if that
 
05:07:36.390 --> 05:07:36.400 align:start position:0%
funding is shifted to Local Schools or
 
05:07:38.390 --> 05:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
local you know state level how would
 
05:07:40.548 --> 05:07:40.558 align:start position:0%
that affect this
 
05:07:43.110 --> 05:07:43.120 align:start position:0%
so just so I understand your question if
 
05:07:44.590 --> 05:07:44.600 align:start position:0%
the amount of federal funding that we're
 
05:07:48.310 --> 05:07:48.320 align:start position:0%
currently getting stops or is
 
05:07:57.470 --> 05:07:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:59.628 --> 05:07:59.638 align:start position:0%
increases so I guess I'm not following
 
05:08:01.150 --> 05:08:01.160 align:start position:0%
so my understanding of the conversation
 
05:08:03.270 --> 05:08:03.280 align:start position:0%
of the federal level is not that they
 
05:08:05.350 --> 05:08:05.360 align:start position:0%
are considering increasing funding to
 
05:08:08.150 --> 05:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
the states is that they are considering
 
05:08:12.270 --> 05:08:12.280 align:start position:0%
decreasing funding if anything so I I
 
05:08:13.708 --> 05:08:13.718 align:start position:0%
guess to answer the question if we got
 
05:08:15.030 --> 05:08:15.040 align:start position:0%
more money from the Feds that would be
 
05:08:17.150 --> 05:08:17.160 align:start position:0%
great um it would I think reduce a lot
 
05:08:18.310 --> 05:08:18.320 align:start position:0%
of these tensions that we're talking
 
05:08:20.030 --> 05:08:20.040 align:start position:0%
about I don't think that's the direction
 
05:08:21.350 --> 05:08:21.360 align:start position:0%
that the conversations are going at
 
05:08:23.708 --> 05:08:23.718 align:start position:0%
least my understanding of the federal
 
05:08:25.548 --> 05:08:25.558 align:start position:0%
conversations thank you other questions
 
05:08:27.910 --> 05:08:27.920 align:start position:0%
for this witness seeing none thank you
 
05:08:29.310 --> 05:08:29.320 align:start position:0%
very much sir thank you next I'm going
 
05:08:31.990 --> 05:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
to call on Sandra Canon please from
 
05:08:32.000 --> 05:08:39.670 align:start position:0%
to call on Sandra Canon please from
Atkinson

05:08:39.670 --> 05:08:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:42.750 --> 05:08:42.760 align:start position:0%
um thank you for letting me speak um I
 
05:08:44.868 --> 05:08:44.878 align:start position:0%
just wanted to say that can you hear it
 
05:08:46.350 --> 05:08:46.360 align:start position:0%
you know can I get you a little get just
 
05:08:47.750 --> 05:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
get a little closer to the microphone
 
05:08:50.628 --> 05:08:50.638 align:start position:0%
thank you okay um thank you for letting
 
05:08:53.190 --> 05:08:53.200 align:start position:0%
me speak um I just really want to point
 
05:08:55.150 --> 05:08:55.160 align:start position:0%
out that what the woman from miramac
 
05:08:57.510 --> 05:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
said about how local communities are
 
05:09:00.110 --> 05:09:00.120 align:start position:0%
doing it she made some good points there
 
05:09:03.110 --> 05:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
um I also feel that the judicial even
 
05:09:05.390 --> 05:09:05.400 align:start position:0%
though the education committee hasn't
 
05:09:07.990 --> 05:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
been listening to them as a constituent
 
05:09:10.470 --> 05:09:10.480 align:start position:0%
I feel like they have to stay somewhat
 
05:09:12.990 --> 05:09:13.000 align:start position:0%
involved to try to keep pushing that and
 
05:09:15.270 --> 05:09:15.280 align:start position:0%
if all of a sudden they're cut out then
 
05:09:17.350 --> 05:09:17.360 align:start position:0%
there's no reason for the education
 
05:09:20.190 --> 05:09:20.200 align:start position:0%
committee to do anything um I'm also
 
05:09:24.110 --> 05:09:24.120 align:start position:0%
really concerned about um the education
 
05:09:25.750 --> 05:09:25.760 align:start position:0%
Freedom accounts which there's
 
05:09:28.030 --> 05:09:28.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely no accountability for our tax
 
05:09:30.628 --> 05:09:30.638 align:start position:0%
dollars going to that I do see a court
 
05:09:32.948 --> 05:09:32.958 align:start position:0%
case coming probably concerning that
 
05:09:35.628 --> 05:09:35.638 align:start position:0%
since there's no way for us to have any
 
05:09:39.990 --> 05:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
um information um so if if we're to stop
 
05:09:42.670 --> 05:09:42.680 align:start position:0%
all this then that means that the courts
 
05:09:44.708 --> 05:09:44.718 align:start position:0%
can't get involved in another issue
 
05:09:46.030 --> 05:09:46.040 align:start position:0%
related to
 
05:09:48.990 --> 05:09:49.000 align:start position:0%
education um I also want to go that the
 
05:09:51.548 --> 05:09:51.558 align:start position:0%
perception is with all these court cases
 
05:09:54.990 --> 05:09:55.000 align:start position:0%
the perception is that the education
 
05:09:57.150 --> 05:09:57.160 align:start position:0%
committee is doing nothing we are
 
05:10:00.470 --> 05:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
getting no more funding at all um there
 
05:10:03.350 --> 05:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
was even a bill that came up um House
 
05:10:06.390 --> 05:10:06.400 align:start position:0%
Bill 550 to increase the amount of money
 
05:10:07.590 --> 05:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
to that
 
05:10:11.030 --> 05:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
$7,000 that um Zach talked about um and
 
05:10:14.030 --> 05:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
that was shot down in committee um and I
 
05:10:17.390 --> 05:10:17.400 align:start position:0%
just feel like they're not listening um
 
05:10:20.948 --> 05:10:20.958 align:start position:0%
in that all this burden is being put on
 
05:10:24.030 --> 05:10:24.040 align:start position:0%
taxpayers okay to fund education we're
 
05:10:26.628 --> 05:10:26.638 align:start position:0%
not ask I mean Zach isn't asking for a
 
05:10:28.708 --> 05:10:28.718 align:start position:0%
lot more from the state but enough to
 
05:10:31.190 --> 05:10:31.200 align:start position:0%
make it a little bit better I don't know
 
05:10:33.708 --> 05:10:33.718 align:start position:0%
how many of you have heard about the tax
 
05:10:36.310 --> 05:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
the timberlan tax revolt that happened
 
05:10:39.310 --> 05:10:39.320 align:start position:0%
this year taxes are a huge issue for
 
05:10:42.030 --> 05:10:42.040 align:start position:0%
homeowners and to put it in perspective
 
05:10:44.070 --> 05:10:44.080 align:start position:0%
the dividends and interest tax was
 
05:10:46.750 --> 05:10:46.760 align:start position:0%
phased out that affected the rich the
 
05:10:52.350 --> 05:10:52.360 align:start position:0%
business taxes um were decreased okay um
 
05:10:54.830 --> 05:10:54.840 align:start position:0%
nothing has been done for the homeowners
 
05:10:57.670 --> 05:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
and I feel if the judicial is no longer
 
05:10:59.470 --> 05:10:59.480 align:start position:0%
involved in any of these education
 
05:11:02.548 --> 05:11:02.558 align:start position:0%
issues that still nothing will happen
 
05:11:04.788 --> 05:11:04.798 align:start position:0%
Okay but the timberlan tax revolt at our
 
05:11:07.310 --> 05:11:07.320 align:start position:0%
deliberative session this year our
 
05:11:09.670 --> 05:11:09.680 align:start position:0%
budget that was proposed by the school
 
05:11:14.110 --> 05:11:14.120 align:start position:0%
district and the um um budget committee
 
05:11:18.150 --> 05:11:18.160 align:start position:0%
was a decrease okay by about I'm not
 
05:11:20.030 --> 05:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
sure the numbers but it was a decrease
 
05:11:22.110 --> 05:11:22.120 align:start position:0%
we were going to bit less on our
 
05:11:25.590 --> 05:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
taxes um and then a group came
 
05:11:28.350 --> 05:11:28.360 align:start position:0%
in and if you want to read the article
 
05:11:30.990 --> 05:11:31.000 align:start position:0%
it's out there online a group came in
 
05:11:35.788 --> 05:11:35.798 align:start position:0%
and slashed our budget by $6.7 million
 
05:11:38.470 --> 05:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
down to 81 million where the school
 
05:11:43.510 --> 05:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
district says 83 million is what we have
 
05:11:46.708 --> 05:11:46.718 align:start position:0%
committed and our budget was 88 million
 
05:11:48.548 --> 05:11:48.558 align:start position:0%
so there was some wiggle room in there
 
05:11:49.948 --> 05:11:49.958 align:start position:0%
maybe it could have come down a little
 
05:11:52.190 --> 05:11:52.200 align:start position:0%
bit but it went all the way to 81
 
05:11:55.708 --> 05:11:55.718 align:start position:0%
million now if that passes um because
 
05:11:58.390 --> 05:11:58.400 align:start position:0%
people are fed up with the taxes that's
 
05:12:00.390 --> 05:12:00.400 align:start position:0%
going to hugely affect our school
 
05:12:03.670 --> 05:12:03.680 align:start position:0%
district and I just really feel that I
 
05:12:05.868 --> 05:12:05.878 align:start position:0%
want the judicial to stay involved to
 
05:12:07.990 --> 05:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
keep putting pressure on the education
 
05:12:12.190 --> 05:12:12.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:12.200 --> 05:12:13.910 align:start position:0%
 
representative

05:12:13.910 --> 05:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:12:16.270 --> 05:12:16.280 align:start position:0%
P thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
05:12:18.868 --> 05:12:18.878 align:start position:0%
for taking my question are you aware by
 
05:12:20.868 --> 05:12:20.878 align:start position:0%
any chance that in the last bium the
 
05:12:23.750 --> 05:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
legislature increased um funding for
 
05:12:28.390 --> 05:12:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:31.350 --> 05:12:31.360 align:start position:0%
million um I don't know the numbers on
 
05:12:34.110 --> 05:12:34.120 align:start position:0%
that I know they have increased it for
 
05:12:35.868 --> 05:12:35.878 align:start position:0%
Education Freedom accounts and that they
 
05:12:37.510 --> 05:12:37.520 align:start position:0%
want to open that up to a lot more
 
05:12:39.548 --> 05:12:39.558 align:start position:0%
people they seem to have money for that
 
05:12:41.708 --> 05:12:41.718 align:start position:0%
but not money to increase for the public
 
05:12:44.070 --> 05:12:44.080 align:start position:0%
schools you follow
 
05:12:47.590 --> 05:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
up thank you thank you and thank you
 
05:12:49.628 --> 05:12:49.638 align:start position:0%
again for taking my question are you
 
05:12:52.390 --> 05:12:52.400 align:start position:0%
aware that the funding for Education
 
05:12:54.788 --> 05:12:54.798 align:start position:0%
Freedom accounts accounts for only for
 
05:12:57.510 --> 05:12:57.520 align:start position:0%
accounts for less than 1% of the overall
 
05:12:59.350 --> 05:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
spend education spending in the state of
 
05:13:01.750 --> 05:13:01.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire it is right now but if it
 
05:13:03.390 --> 05:13:03.400 align:start position:0%
gets opened up it's going to be a lot
 
05:13:06.590 --> 05:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
more and I feel like public education is
 
05:13:09.830 --> 05:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
is um is is important
 
05:13:12.830 --> 05:13:12.840 align:start position:0%
uh country's built on public
 
05:13:14.830 --> 05:13:14.840 align:start position:0%
education any other questions for this
 
05:13:17.830 --> 05:13:17.840 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you very much
 
05:13:19.788 --> 05:13:19.798 align:start position:0%
next I'm going to call on Ann Marie
 
05:13:19.798 --> 05:13:28.628 align:start position:0%
next I'm going to call on Ann Marie
Banfield

05:13:28.628 --> 05:13:28.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:31.270 --> 05:13:31.280 align:start position:0%
please good
 
05:13:33.430 --> 05:13:33.440 align:start position:0%
afternoon some of you may know me
 
05:13:36.150 --> 05:13:36.160 align:start position:0%
because you've seen me in the education
 
05:13:38.868 --> 05:13:38.878 align:start position:0%
um policy group my name is Amry Banfield
 
05:13:41.868 --> 05:13:41.878 align:start position:0%
I'm education researcher I'm a parental
 
05:13:44.830 --> 05:13:44.840 align:start position:0%
rights advocate in New Hampshire and I
 
05:13:46.788 --> 05:13:46.798 align:start position:0%
focus on academic excellence in the
 
05:13:49.110 --> 05:13:49.120 align:start position:0%
classro and I've been doing this for 20
 
05:13:51.868 --> 05:13:51.878 align:start position:0%
years and I haven't collected a
 
05:13:55.270 --> 05:13:55.280 align:start position:0%
dime um so what we are seeing right now
 
05:13:56.910 --> 05:13:56.920 align:start position:0%
and I think we can even see it in this
 
05:13:59.430 --> 05:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
room is there seems to be let's blame
 
05:14:02.910 --> 05:14:02.920 align:start position:0%
the state for sometimes irresponsible
 
05:14:05.868 --> 05:14:05.878 align:start position:0%
School budgets and I say irresponsible
 
05:14:08.670 --> 05:14:08.680 align:start position:0%
School budgets because I look at them I
 
05:14:10.390 --> 05:14:10.400 align:start position:0%
serve on the Bedford taxpayers
 
05:14:12.708 --> 05:14:12.718 align:start position:0%
Association for 10 years I'm now running
 
05:14:15.390 --> 05:14:15.400 align:start position:0%
for um budget Committee in h in
 
05:14:18.390 --> 05:14:18.400 align:start position:0%
Northampton because I dig I dig
 
05:14:21.430 --> 05:14:21.440 align:start position:0%
deeper and what I find sometimes going
 
05:14:24.548 --> 05:14:24.558 align:start position:0%
on in schools is quite frankly wasteful
 
05:14:27.310 --> 05:14:27.320 align:start position:0%
spending now I'm not I'm I'm making that
 
05:14:29.430 --> 05:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
statement not for every single school
 
05:14:31.990 --> 05:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
but I'm saying that I see it I see it in
 
05:14:34.270 --> 05:14:34.280 align:start position:0%
my district I see it in other
 
05:14:36.628 --> 05:14:36.638 align:start position:0%
districts uh you mentioned something
 
05:14:40.150 --> 05:14:40.160 align:start position:0%
about um increased spending in gets you
 
05:14:42.750 --> 05:14:42.760 align:start position:0%
better results when I lived in Bedford
 
05:14:45.030 --> 05:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
we had great results but what it doesn't
 
05:14:46.750 --> 05:14:46.760 align:start position:0%
account for is all the kids that go to
 
05:14:48.628 --> 05:14:48.638 align:start position:0%
private tutoring in
 
05:14:52.910 --> 05:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
Bedford so there's a lot of information
 
05:14:54.750 --> 05:14:54.760 align:start position:0%
in some of these scores that are not
 
05:14:57.430 --> 05:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
always app parent so you could increase
 
05:15:00.110 --> 05:15:00.120 align:start position:0%
spending all you want in your schools
 
05:15:01.788 --> 05:15:01.798 align:start position:0%
but if you're not still providing a good
 
05:15:04.190 --> 05:15:04.200 align:start position:0%
education the parents in the in the rich
 
05:15:05.470 --> 05:15:05.480 align:start position:0%
districts are going to make sure their
 
05:15:07.830 --> 05:15:07.840 align:start position:0%
kids don't fall through the
 
05:15:10.150 --> 05:15:10.160 align:start position:0%
cracks um
 
05:15:13.230 --> 05:15:13.240 align:start position:0%
um so yes I do look at what's going on
 
05:15:15.030 --> 05:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
in the schools I thank the attorneys who
 
05:15:16.948 --> 05:15:16.958 align:start position:0%
came up here I'm certainly not going to
 
05:15:18.628 --> 05:15:18.638 align:start position:0%
speak on that because I'm not an
 
05:15:20.310 --> 05:15:20.320 align:start position:0%
attorney and I'm not going to speak on
 
05:15:22.830 --> 05:15:22.840 align:start position:0%
that but I am going to tell you that for
 
05:15:25.910 --> 05:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
instance in miramac you know they spend
 
05:15:29.708 --> 05:15:29.718 align:start position:0%
$90,000 on a math program that includes
 
05:15:31.868 --> 05:15:31.878 align:start position:0%
social emotional learning and it
 
05:15:34.590 --> 05:15:34.600 align:start position:0%
includes Fine Arts and I have to ask
 
05:15:37.670 --> 05:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
where's the math so when I look at
 
05:15:40.350 --> 05:15:40.360 align:start position:0%
scores when I look at where the spending
 
05:15:43.670 --> 05:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
is going and they have multiple programs
 
05:15:44.990 --> 05:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
in their
 
05:15:48.470 --> 05:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
schools my question to you is do you
 
05:15:52.350 --> 05:15:52.360 align:start position:0%
just want to give that over more money
 
05:15:54.750 --> 05:15:54.760 align:start position:0%
or would it be you know I'm a lobbyist I
 
05:15:56.548 --> 05:15:56.558 align:start position:0%
come to the education committee and I
 
05:15:59.230 --> 05:15:59.240 align:start position:0%
tell them about these issues I would
 
05:16:01.070 --> 05:16:01.080 align:start position:0%
like to go to them and say you know what
 
05:16:02.990 --> 05:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
there are probably some schools in the
 
05:16:05.628 --> 05:16:05.638 align:start position:0%
state that need funding and we need to
 
05:16:09.110 --> 05:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
focus on them teachers are having to
 
05:16:11.910 --> 05:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
purchase their own materials in their
 
05:16:14.430 --> 05:16:14.440 align:start position:0%
classroom while we're spending $90,000
 
05:16:16.548 --> 05:16:16.558 align:start position:0%
on a math program that many teachers
 
05:16:19.750 --> 05:16:19.760 align:start position:0%
don't even like so those are the kinds
 
05:16:22.030 --> 05:16:22.040 align:start position:0%
of things that I get to do as a lobbyist
 
05:16:23.708 --> 05:16:23.718 align:start position:0%
but guess what I can't go before the
 
05:16:25.990 --> 05:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
judicial branch and say any of this
 
05:16:28.390 --> 05:16:28.400 align:start position:0%
because that's not my role and that's
 
05:16:30.830 --> 05:16:30.840 align:start position:0%
not the role of the judicial branch so
 
05:16:32.830 --> 05:16:32.840 align:start position:0%
now we've got them making these
 
05:16:35.510 --> 05:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
decisions that I can't weigh in on and
 
05:16:38.070 --> 05:16:38.080 align:start position:0%
explain some of this to you or explain
 
05:16:40.390 --> 05:16:40.400 align:start position:0%
some of it to the education funding
 
05:16:44.750 --> 05:16:44.760 align:start position:0%
group um committee I'm sorry so that's
 
05:16:47.150 --> 05:16:47.160 align:start position:0%
why I think it's important to take back
 
05:16:49.990 --> 05:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
this role of
 
05:16:52.350 --> 05:16:52.360 align:start position:0%
legislators and stop letting the
 
05:16:52.360 --> 05:16:54.270 align:start position:0%
legislators and stop letting the
Judiciary

05:16:54.270 --> 05:16:54.280 align:start position:0%
Judiciary
 
05:16:57.548 --> 05:16:57.558 align:start position:0%
Branch basically do your function and it
 
05:16:59.670 --> 05:16:59.680 align:start position:0%
it now it allows me and allows other
 
05:17:01.430 --> 05:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
people with differing views maybe there
 
05:17:03.788 --> 05:17:03.798 align:start position:0%
is a school district that needs money
 
05:17:06.030 --> 05:17:06.040 align:start position:0%
let them come up and tell you let them
 
05:17:07.590 --> 05:17:07.600 align:start position:0%
come up and tell you look this is what
 
05:17:09.548 --> 05:17:09.558 align:start position:0%
we've got going on
 
05:17:11.110 --> 05:17:11.120 align:start position:0%
but I'm telling you in Northampton we're
 
05:17:11.120 --> 05:17:12.110 align:start position:0%
but I'm telling you in Northampton we're
spending

05:17:12.110 --> 05:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
spending
 
05:17:15.350 --> 05:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
$39,000 per student in our district if
 
05:17:17.150 --> 05:17:17.160 align:start position:0%
our budget passes and our budget is
 
05:17:18.910 --> 05:17:18.920 align:start position:0%
pretty much close to the default so it's
 
05:17:21.750 --> 05:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
going to pass so we're spending
 
05:17:25.470 --> 05:17:25.480 align:start position:0%
$39,000 per student in my district and
 
05:17:28.510 --> 05:17:28.520 align:start position:0%
it's up to me when I run as a budget
 
05:17:28.520 --> 05:17:29.628 align:start position:0%
it's up to me when I run as a budget
Committee

05:17:29.628 --> 05:17:29.638 align:start position:0%
Committee
 
05:17:34.190 --> 05:17:34.200 align:start position:0%
Member to now decide on what and and I
 
05:17:36.830 --> 05:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
and I engage my budget committee to the
 
05:17:38.830 --> 05:17:38.840 align:start position:0%
point where I'm probably in a since but
 
05:17:41.628 --> 05:17:41.638 align:start position:0%
seriously I do engage in this process
 
05:17:43.390 --> 05:17:43.400 align:start position:0%
and that's what we all can do in our own
 
05:17:46.590 --> 05:17:46.600 align:start position:0%
local towns but I don't get to do this
 
05:17:49.390 --> 05:17:49.400 align:start position:0%
with the Judiciary Branch who gets to
 
05:17:53.150 --> 05:17:53.160 align:start position:0%
now interpret law and yes I do see see
 
05:17:54.548 --> 05:17:54.558 align:start position:0%
it as an
 
05:17:56.990 --> 05:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
overreach did you know that most
 
05:17:59.990 --> 05:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
administrators um at the SAU level are
 
05:18:02.190 --> 05:18:02.200 align:start position:0%
making more than the governor the
 
05:18:04.910 --> 05:18:04.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner and the Attorney General in
 
05:18:07.510 --> 05:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
almost probably every school district in
 
05:18:11.230 --> 05:18:11.240 align:start position:0%
the state so there's ways that that we
 
05:18:13.628 --> 05:18:13.638 align:start position:0%
can bring down property taxes if we
 
05:18:16.750 --> 05:18:16.760 align:start position:0%
really wanted to the the problem is is
 
05:18:18.750 --> 05:18:18.760 align:start position:0%
that most local communities don't want
 
05:18:20.470 --> 05:18:20.480 align:start position:0%
to do that hard work they don't want to
 
05:18:23.670 --> 05:18:23.680 align:start position:0%
make those decisions and so that's why a
 
05:18:25.310 --> 05:18:25.320 align:start position:0%
lot of times the state give us more
 
05:18:27.190 --> 05:18:27.200 align:start position:0%
money you're not you're not giving us
 
05:18:29.670 --> 05:18:29.680 align:start position:0%
enough well maybe it's because like I
 
05:18:31.030 --> 05:18:31.040 align:start position:0%
think the governor pointed out and I
 
05:18:32.788 --> 05:18:32.798 align:start position:0%
think Sharon Carson Senator Carson
 
05:18:34.430 --> 05:18:34.440 align:start position:0%
pointed out that
 
05:18:37.070 --> 05:18:37.080 align:start position:0%
we're you know we're not going to fund
 
05:18:38.788 --> 05:18:38.798 align:start position:0%
your bad decisions or we're not going to
 
05:18:41.110 --> 05:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
fund you're overspending and I would
 
05:18:43.230 --> 05:18:43.240 align:start position:0%
agree with that but at the same time I
 
05:18:46.270 --> 05:18:46.280 align:start position:0%
do understand that there is a need for
 
05:18:47.948 --> 05:18:47.958 align:start position:0%
schools to get the
 
05:18:47.958 --> 05:18:52.030 align:start position:0%
schools to get the
funding

05:18:52.030 --> 05:18:52.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:54.230 --> 05:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
um I just want to make sure I've hit
 
05:18:57.270 --> 05:18:57.280 align:start position:0%
everything up I think I have um yeah
 
05:18:58.708 --> 05:18:58.718 align:start position:0%
that's all I wanted to say thank you
 
05:19:00.670 --> 05:19:00.680 align:start position:0%
thank you questions for this
 
05:19:03.470 --> 05:19:03.480 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you very
 
05:19:05.868 --> 05:19:05.878 align:start position:0%
much is there anyone else here who
 
05:19:08.150 --> 05:19:08.160 align:start position:0%
wishes to be heard on uh house
 
05:19:10.510 --> 05:19:10.520 align:start position:0%
concurrent resolution
 
05:19:13.110 --> 05:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
11 seeing none I'm going to close the
 
05:19:16.030 --> 05:19:16.040 align:start position:0%
hearing on house concurrent resolution
 
05:19:20.548 --> 05:19:20.558 align:start position:0%
11 and I'm going to uh open the hearing
 
05:19:24.470 --> 05:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
on uh house resolution
 
05:19:31.230 --> 05:19:31.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:34.830 --> 05:19:34.840 align:start position:0%
on and I will uh recognize the prime
 
05:19:47.990 --> 05:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:50.708 --> 05:19:50.718 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman members of
 
05:19:52.788 --> 05:19:52.798 align:start position:0%
the committee very much my pleasure to
 
05:19:55.030 --> 05:19:55.040 align:start position:0%
be here this afternoon to introduce
 
05:19:57.510 --> 05:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
this for the record representative Mike
 
05:20:01.868 --> 05:20:01.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:05.270 --> 05:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
4 first let me say that despite this
 
05:20:07.788 --> 05:20:07.798 align:start position:0%
body recently demonstrating that it does
 
05:20:11.230 --> 05:20:11.240 align:start position:0%
have an appetite to exercise its
 
05:20:14.150 --> 05:20:14.160 align:start position:0%
impeachment Powers when warranted as a
 
05:20:17.070 --> 05:20:17.080 align:start position:0%
point of clarity this resolution is not
 
05:20:19.670 --> 05:20:19.680 align:start position:0%
articles of impeachment and should it
 
05:20:22.030 --> 05:20:22.040 align:start position:0%
pass the house it does not affect
 
05:20:25.350 --> 05:20:25.360 align:start position:0%
impeachment rather it authorizes a house
 
05:20:27.510 --> 05:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
investigation most probably taking the
 
05:20:29.670 --> 05:20:29.680 align:start position:0%
form of a brief special
 
05:20:32.230 --> 05:20:32.240 align:start position:0%
committee to look at the issue
 
05:20:33.990 --> 05:20:34.000 align:start position:0%
investigate the issue and render a
 
05:20:37.150 --> 05:20:37.160 align:start position:0%
recommendation on whether to proceed
 
05:20:40.670 --> 05:20:40.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:44.190 --> 05:20:44.200 align:start position:0%
there is substantial cause at present to
 
05:20:47.070 --> 05:20:47.080 align:start position:0%
believe that impeachment may be
 
05:20:49.910 --> 05:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
inappropriate remedy in this
 
05:20:52.670 --> 05:20:52.680 align:start position:0%
case it appears that the judge in this
 
05:20:55.708 --> 05:20:55.718 align:start position:0%
particular decision is guilty of the
 
05:20:59.190 --> 05:20:59.200 align:start position:0%
following usurpation of the exclusive
 
05:21:02.470 --> 05:21:02.480 align:start position:0%
powers of this legislature to both
 
05:21:07.150 --> 05:21:07.160 align:start position:0%
allocate funds and Levy
 
05:21:11.230 --> 05:21:11.240 align:start position:0%
taxes extr ex to extreme judicial
 
05:21:13.708 --> 05:21:13.718 align:start position:0%
activism on behalf of a partisan
 
05:21:16.430 --> 05:21:16.440 align:start position:0%
political cause thereby seeking to
 
05:21:20.628 --> 05:21:20.638 align:start position:0%
bypass us as the political body and
 
05:21:22.070 --> 05:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
perhaps more
 
05:21:24.548 --> 05:21:24.558 align:start position:0%
importantly bypassing the people of this
 
05:21:27.708 --> 05:21:27.718 align:start position:0%
state who elected us to represent
 
05:21:30.948 --> 05:21:30.958 align:start position:0%
them three
 
05:21:34.190 --> 05:21:34.200 align:start position:0%
imprudence and usurpation of the greater
 
05:21:36.868 --> 05:21:36.878 align:start position:0%
powers of the New Hampshire Supreme
 
05:21:39.708 --> 05:21:39.718 align:start position:0%
Court by refusing using to stay the
 
05:21:43.708 --> 05:21:43.718 align:start position:0%
order pending a review by the only
 
05:21:46.270 --> 05:21:46.280 align:start position:0%
constitutionally established Court in
 
05:21:49.390 --> 05:21:49.400 align:start position:0%
this state the Supreme Court allow me to
 
05:21:53.590 --> 05:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
provide some brief preemptive answers to
 
05:21:56.390 --> 05:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
some of the arguments that you might see
 
05:21:56.400 --> 05:21:57.310 align:start position:0%
some of the arguments that you might see
against

05:21:57.310 --> 05:21:57.320 align:start position:0%
against
 
05:22:00.470 --> 05:22:00.480 align:start position:0%
this first it might be argued that the
 
05:22:02.830 --> 05:22:02.840 align:start position:0%
financial calculations utilized in this
 
05:22:05.628 --> 05:22:05.638 align:start position:0%
opinion were good and
 
05:22:08.510 --> 05:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
correct however it can also be aru
 
05:22:11.110 --> 05:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
argued reasonably that they were not
 
05:22:14.788 --> 05:22:14.798 align:start position:0%
good and correct and that a variety of
 
05:22:18.470 --> 05:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
other paradigms exist for funding of
 
05:22:18.480 --> 05:22:20.310 align:start position:0%
other paradigms exist for funding of
public

05:22:20.310 --> 05:22:20.320 align:start position:0%
public
 
05:22:23.830 --> 05:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
education that were not considered here
 
05:22:27.390 --> 05:22:27.400 align:start position:0%
the existence of these alternate
 
05:22:29.948 --> 05:22:29.958 align:start position:0%
paradigms fundamentally makes this a
 
05:22:33.350 --> 05:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
policy issue and a policy issue is
 
05:22:36.548 --> 05:22:36.558 align:start position:0%
fundamentally a political issue and this
 
05:22:40.990 --> 05:22:41.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:44.470 --> 05:22:44.480 align:start position:0%
government the the Judiciary is supposed
 
05:22:45.670 --> 05:22:45.680 align:start position:0%
to be
 
05:22:49.110 --> 05:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
apolitical making findings of fact and
 
05:22:51.708 --> 05:22:51.718 align:start position:0%
Faithfully applying the law that is the
 
05:22:55.590 --> 05:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
extent of the judiciary's delegated
 
05:22:58.910 --> 05:22:58.920 align:start position:0%
authority second it might be argued that
 
05:23:01.230 --> 05:23:01.240 align:start position:0%
the Judiciary is a co-equal branch of
 
05:23:03.150 --> 05:23:03.160 align:start position:0%
government and therefore should be able
 
05:23:05.110 --> 05:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
to render this sort of
 
05:23:07.430 --> 05:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
opinion setting aside the previous
 
05:23:08.910 --> 05:23:08.920 align:start position:0%
argument that proves the General
 
05:23:12.750 --> 05:23:12.760 align:start position:0%
falsehood of that it's also specifically
 
05:23:15.990 --> 05:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
false the only portion of the Judiciary
 
05:23:18.590 --> 05:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
that enjoys a co-equal status with this
 
05:23:20.948 --> 05:23:20.958 align:start position:0%
legislature and the executive is the
 
05:23:23.430 --> 05:23:23.440 align:start position:0%
branch is the part of the Judiciary
 
05:23:26.150 --> 05:23:26.160 align:start position:0%
established by the Constitution which is
 
05:23:28.270 --> 05:23:28.280 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court of New
 
05:23:32.190 --> 05:23:32.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the lower courts by contrast
 
05:23:35.670 --> 05:23:35.680 align:start position:0%
are not co-equal they exist under this
 
05:23:37.910 --> 05:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
branch of government and regulated by
 
05:23:41.230 --> 05:23:41.240 align:start position:0%
this branch of government therefore Not
 
05:23:44.548 --> 05:23:44.558 align:start position:0%
only was this decision extreme overreach
 
05:23:47.350 --> 05:23:47.360 align:start position:0%
usurping legislative Authority it was
 
05:23:50.470 --> 05:23:50.480 align:start position:0%
also usurping the co-ee equality of the
 
05:23:50.480 --> 05:23:52.548 align:start position:0%
also usurping the co-ee equality of the
Supreme

05:23:52.548 --> 05:23:52.558 align:start position:0%
Supreme
 
05:23:55.830 --> 05:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
Court third it might be argued that this
 
05:23:58.670 --> 05:23:58.680 align:start position:0%
opinion is a logical extension of
 
05:24:00.948 --> 05:24:00.958 align:start position:0%
previous Supreme Court
 
05:24:04.470 --> 05:24:04.480 align:start position:0%
president however the reality is that
 
05:24:08.390 --> 05:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
this decision so far exceeded any prior
 
05:24:10.628 --> 05:24:10.638 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire judicial decision that
 
05:24:14.350 --> 05:24:14.360 align:start position:0%
even assuming a full a full agreement
 
05:24:16.548 --> 05:24:16.558 align:start position:0%
with all previous
 
05:24:19.070 --> 05:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
precedents this cannot be reasonably
 
05:24:21.670 --> 05:24:21.680 align:start position:0%
extended as a as a logical extension of
 
05:24:25.470 --> 05:24:25.480 align:start position:0%
them no prior judicial opinion has made
 
05:24:28.910 --> 05:24:28.920 align:start position:0%
has made specific and radical funding
 
05:24:32.750 --> 05:24:32.760 align:start position:0%
demands of this body that also implicate
 
05:24:35.030 --> 05:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
the taxation authority of this body
 
05:24:37.270 --> 05:24:37.280 align:start position:0%
we're talking about amount of money here
 
05:24:41.150 --> 05:24:41.160 align:start position:0%
that is somewhere between 5 and 6% I
 
05:24:44.470 --> 05:24:44.480 align:start position:0%
think of the biannual budget represented
 
05:24:50.628 --> 05:24:50.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:53.548 --> 05:24:53.558 align:start position:0%
decision fourth it has been suggested
 
05:24:55.708 --> 05:24:55.718 align:start position:0%
that such impeachment proceedings might
 
05:24:58.990 --> 05:24:59.000 align:start position:0%
threaten the independence of the
 
05:25:01.590 --> 05:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
Judiciary that argument lies entirely in
 
05:25:04.390 --> 05:25:04.400 align:start position:0%
a faulty premise the Judiciary is no
 
05:25:07.430 --> 05:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
more independent than the executive or
 
05:25:09.150 --> 05:25:09.160 align:start position:0%
than the legislature
 
05:25:11.070 --> 05:25:11.080 align:start position:0%
we exist as co-equal
 
05:25:13.470 --> 05:25:13.480 align:start position:0%
branches that doesn't mean the same it
 
05:25:16.510 --> 05:25:16.520 align:start position:0%
means we have different delegated powers
 
05:25:18.110 --> 05:25:18.120 align:start position:0%
with which to hold each other
 
05:25:22.110 --> 05:25:22.120 align:start position:0%
accountable and responsible to the
 
05:25:24.548 --> 05:25:24.558 align:start position:0%
constitution in this light these
 
05:25:27.470 --> 05:25:27.480 align:start position:0%
Arguments for judicial Independence to
 
05:25:30.510 --> 05:25:30.520 align:start position:0%
prevent us from weighing in on our own
 
05:25:33.830 --> 05:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
territory of policy is little more than
 
05:25:36.230 --> 05:25:36.240 align:start position:0%
an argument for judicial Supremacy and a
 
05:25:38.830 --> 05:25:38.840 align:start position:0%
form of oligarchy
 
05:25:40.510 --> 05:25:40.520 align:start position:0%
that is not what we
 
05:25:43.708 --> 05:25:43.718 align:start position:0%
are in summary it appears to me that
 
05:25:46.470 --> 05:25:46.480 align:start position:0%
this judge in this case thought himself
 
05:25:47.868 --> 05:25:47.878 align:start position:0%
King of New
 
05:25:51.430 --> 05:25:51.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that duty to correct this
 
05:25:56.270 --> 05:25:56.280 align:start position:0%
error is ours alone nobody else has the
 
05:26:00.030 --> 05:26:00.040 align:start position:0%
authority to fix this problem if we fail
 
05:26:02.788 --> 05:26:02.798 align:start position:0%
now we can and should expect that the
 
05:26:05.070 --> 05:26:05.080 align:start position:0%
next decisions rendered will be even
 
05:26:07.628 --> 05:26:07.638 align:start position:0%
more radical and we might just find that
 
05:26:09.948 --> 05:26:09.958 align:start position:0%
our Republic form of government is
 
05:26:13.310 --> 05:26:13.320 align:start position:0%
irrecoverable if we do not act now thank
 
05:26:16.110 --> 05:26:16.120 align:start position:0%
you and I will take questions I'm sorry
 
05:26:18.750 --> 05:26:18.760 align:start position:0%
questions for the representative
 
05:26:21.788 --> 05:26:21.798 align:start position:0%
organ yes uh which uh I guess there was
 
05:26:24.548 --> 05:26:24.558 align:start position:0%
a Kuku versus New Hampshire in 2019 in
 
05:26:27.070 --> 05:26:27.080 align:start position:0%
2024 I haven't looked at the court
 
05:26:29.470 --> 05:26:29.480 align:start position:0%
docket for I guess there's two court
 
05:26:32.750 --> 05:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
cases rather than one so that uh I mean
 
05:26:35.470 --> 05:26:35.480 align:start position:0%
I guess we can get this we can we can
 
05:26:36.830 --> 05:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
get this through our own channels but
 
05:26:38.590 --> 05:26:38.600 align:start position:0%
that's something you can provide provide
 
05:26:40.030 --> 05:26:40.040 align:start position:0%
the committee so you can see like
 
05:26:42.030 --> 05:26:42.040 align:start position:0%
exactly what it is you're talking about
 
05:26:43.230 --> 05:26:43.240 align:start position:0%
what exactly what it is you're
 
05:26:46.030 --> 05:26:46.040 align:start position:0%
complaining about um
 
05:26:48.350 --> 05:26:48.360 align:start position:0%
so I'm not entirely sure I understand
 
05:26:51.270 --> 05:26:51.280 align:start position:0%
the question um I guess the other
 
05:26:54.070 --> 05:26:54.080 align:start position:0%
question is uh what's the status of this
 
05:26:56.310 --> 05:26:56.320 align:start position:0%
case in the courts so like the uh I I
 
05:26:58.470 --> 05:26:58.480 align:start position:0%
know he made an order which then was up
 
05:26:59.670 --> 05:26:59.680 align:start position:0%
I think it was upheld by the Supreme
 
05:27:02.230 --> 05:27:02.240 align:start position:0%
Court I was just sort of looking I just
 
05:27:04.110 --> 05:27:04.120 align:start position:0%
thank you that that but then there's a
 
05:27:06.190 --> 05:27:06.200 align:start position:0%
second lawsuit I guess too this filed
 
05:27:09.190 --> 05:27:09.200 align:start position:0%
last year I guess or is that correct
 
05:27:10.750 --> 05:27:10.760 align:start position:0%
uh let me take the first question first
 
05:27:11.670 --> 05:27:11.680 align:start position:0%
then you can repeat the second one
 
05:27:13.110 --> 05:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
because I didn't quite catch it so the
 
05:27:15.708 --> 05:27:15.718 align:start position:0%
first answer would be um it is my
 
05:27:17.628 --> 05:27:17.638 align:start position:0%
understanding that the Supreme Court did
 
05:27:20.470 --> 05:27:20.480 align:start position:0%
step in to stay this decision thankfully
 
05:27:22.350 --> 05:27:22.360 align:start position:0%
where the judge himself had refused to
 
05:27:24.868 --> 05:27:24.878 align:start position:0%
stay it and it's now being seen before
 
05:27:26.750 --> 05:27:26.760 align:start position:0%
The Supreme Court and pending a decision
 
05:27:28.230 --> 05:27:28.240 align:start position:0%
which is why I think it's even more
 
05:27:31.030 --> 05:27:31.040 align:start position:0%
important right now to take some action
 
05:27:33.150 --> 05:27:33.160 align:start position:0%
and again passing this resolution does
 
05:27:34.350 --> 05:27:34.360 align:start position:0%
not mean impeachment it means
 
05:27:36.708 --> 05:27:36.718 align:start position:0%
investigation that might lead to
 
05:27:38.628 --> 05:27:38.638 align:start position:0%
impeachment and I think it's extremely
 
05:27:41.310 --> 05:27:41.320 align:start position:0%
important that we signal to the entire
 
05:27:43.548 --> 05:27:43.558 align:start position:0%
Judiciary that this branch of government
 
05:27:46.350 --> 05:27:46.360 align:start position:0%
takes our powers very seriously and
 
05:27:48.510 --> 05:27:48.520 align:start position:0%
we're prepared to take action on it
 
05:27:50.548 --> 05:27:50.558 align:start position:0%
because the last bill you heard was
 
05:27:53.030 --> 05:27:53.040 align:start position:0%
talking about effectively what could be
 
05:27:55.310 --> 05:27:55.320 align:start position:0%
called the Constitutional crisis and if
 
05:27:57.230 --> 05:27:57.240 align:start position:0%
you don't want a constitutional crisis
 
05:27:58.708 --> 05:27:58.718 align:start position:0%
you need to prevent it before the
 
05:28:01.110 --> 05:28:01.120 align:start position:0%
decision happens other questions for
 
05:28:03.788 --> 05:28:03.798 align:start position:0%
this witness representative tur yeah
 
05:28:05.270 --> 05:28:05.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thanks for taking
 
05:28:07.548 --> 05:28:07.558 align:start position:0%
the question um I think I heard in your
 
05:28:10.628 --> 05:28:10.638 align:start position:0%
introduction of the bill you claimed one
 
05:28:13.190 --> 05:28:13.200 align:start position:0%
of the the issues leading to this was
 
05:28:15.590 --> 05:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
judicial activism on a partisan
 
05:28:17.830 --> 05:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
political cause and I was hoping you
 
05:28:19.548 --> 05:28:19.558 align:start position:0%
could clarify that are you are you
 
05:28:21.270 --> 05:28:21.280 align:start position:0%
saying that the funding of public
 
05:28:24.070 --> 05:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
education and how it's paid for is in
 
05:28:26.070 --> 05:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
fact a partisan political
 
05:28:29.030 --> 05:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
cause yes absolutely there's multiple
 
05:28:31.628 --> 05:28:31.638 align:start position:0%
different um paradigms by which a public
 
05:28:33.270 --> 05:28:33.280 align:start position:0%
education can be offered presently in
 
05:28:35.070 --> 05:28:35.080 align:start position:0%
this state we have not just a
 
05:28:36.590 --> 05:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
traditional government run schools we
 
05:28:39.150 --> 05:28:39.160 align:start position:0%
also have efas and other uh available
 
05:28:41.470 --> 05:28:41.480 align:start position:0%
options for people to provide a publicly
 
05:28:43.670 --> 05:28:43.680 align:start position:0%
funded education to their children and
 
05:28:45.230 --> 05:28:45.240 align:start position:0%
we fight all the time you can look at
 
05:28:47.030 --> 05:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
the partisan breakdown of the votes of
 
05:28:48.628 --> 05:28:48.638 align:start position:0%
course these are partisan issues and of
 
05:28:50.430 --> 05:28:50.440 align:start position:0%
course that's what the the judge was
 
05:28:52.070 --> 05:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
weighing in
 
05:28:54.788 --> 05:28:54.798 align:start position:0%

hr7 um
 
05:29:48.910 --> 05:29:48.920 align:start position:0%
I understand that there is the
 
05:29:53.430 --> 05:29:53.440 align:start position:0%
separation of powers and that um the
 
05:29:56.350 --> 05:29:56.360 align:start position:0%
gentleman before was just speaking about
 
05:30:01.350 --> 05:30:01.360 align:start position:0%
how um they how you're they're ready to
 
05:30:04.110 --> 05:30:04.120 align:start position:0%
be acted upon here and that action is
 
05:30:07.708 --> 05:30:07.718 align:start position:0%
going to be done but this was at least
 
05:30:10.190 --> 05:30:10.200 align:start position:0%
five years ago that this first one came
 
05:30:14.430 --> 05:30:14.440 align:start position:0%
out um and we've had uh
 
05:30:18.390 --> 05:30:18.400 align:start position:0%
continued um lawsuit or uh cases that
 
05:30:22.110 --> 05:30:22.120 align:start position:0%
you guys have spoken about um where
 
05:30:28.110 --> 05:30:28.120 align:start position:0%
you're uh saying that the um committee
 
05:30:31.830 --> 05:30:31.840 align:start position:0%
is um going to make a decision and move
 
05:30:36.430 --> 05:30:36.440 align:start position:0%
on uh increasing the cost um or or of
 
05:30:40.470 --> 05:30:40.480 align:start position:0%
adequate education or a um and none of
 
05:30:45.350 --> 05:30:45.360 align:start position:0%
that has happened yet um so I I can
 
05:30:48.750 --> 05:30:48.760 align:start position:0%
understand um that everybody has like
 
05:30:52.990 --> 05:30:53.000 align:start position:0%
you know your own place and role um but
 
05:30:57.548 --> 05:30:57.558 align:start position:0%
if things aren't being done and the
 
05:31:02.548 --> 05:31:02.558 align:start position:0%
increase isn't there um how else are we
 
05:31:05.190 --> 05:31:05.200 align:start position:0%
supposed to get
 
05:31:09.230 --> 05:31:09.240 align:start position:0%
anything uh improved um who is going to
 
05:31:12.628 --> 05:31:12.638 align:start position:0%
take action who is going to uh make sure
 
05:31:16.708 --> 05:31:16.718 align:start position:0%
that we increase and take care of our
 
05:31:21.310 --> 05:31:21.320 align:start position:0%
students and our um Community I the
 
05:31:25.670 --> 05:31:25.680 align:start position:0%
comment before about um property taxes
 
05:31:29.430 --> 05:31:29.440 align:start position:0%
um we in my town in marac which was
 
05:31:33.230 --> 05:31:33.240 align:start position:0%
already spoken about um we did approve
 
05:31:36.070 --> 05:31:36.080 align:start position:0%
the budget because we do value our
 
05:31:38.788 --> 05:31:38.798 align:start position:0%
education and we have seen our uh
 
05:31:41.470 --> 05:31:41.480 align:start position:0%
reading scores are above the state
 
05:31:44.150 --> 05:31:44.160 align:start position:0%
average um across the board for all
 
05:31:48.470 --> 05:31:48.480 align:start position:0%
grades because we have invested extra
 
05:31:53.030 --> 05:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
money and gone above and uh had hearings
 
05:31:55.430 --> 05:31:55.440 align:start position:0%
to approve things you I don't mean to
 
05:31:57.070 --> 05:31:57.080 align:start position:0%
interrupt me but we seem to be getting a
 
05:31:59.868 --> 05:31:59.878 align:start position:0%
little this is the bill here is dealing
 
05:32:03.230 --> 05:32:03.240 align:start position:0%
with the correct I did get off topic
 
05:32:06.150 --> 05:32:06.160 align:start position:0%
sorry I was just thinking back to that
 
05:32:10.548 --> 05:32:10.558 align:start position:0%
um you're right I apologize um this um I
 
05:32:15.470 --> 05:32:15.480 align:start position:0%
I think that the main question shouldn't
 
05:32:19.270 --> 05:32:19.280 align:start position:0%
be um should we be trying to investigate
 
05:32:22.150 --> 05:32:22.160 align:start position:0%
this uh judge but
 
05:32:26.470 --> 05:32:26.480 align:start position:0%
rather what are we doing about the
 
05:32:29.670 --> 05:32:29.680 align:start position:0%
inadequate Aid that we are currently
 
05:32:34.390 --> 05:32:34.400 align:start position:0%
providing to our towns and districts to
 
05:32:37.150 --> 05:32:37.160 align:start position:0%

05:32:53.270 --> 05:32:53.280 align:start position:0%
Canon um okay I don't I guess Miss Canon
 
05:32:55.708 --> 05:32:55.718 align:start position:0%
is not here I think she may have been I
 
05:32:56.910 --> 05:32:56.920 align:start position:0%
thought she might have been here earlier
 
05:32:59.628 --> 05:32:59.638 align:start position:0%
but anyway all right um is there anyone
 
05:33:02.430 --> 05:33:02.440 align:start position:0%

05:33:19.150 --> 05:33:19.160 align:start position:0%
next bill in my notebook and I'm going
 
05:33:34.430 --> 05:33:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:39.390 --> 05:33:39.400 align:start position:0%

05:34:37.910 --> 05:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:37.920 --> 05:34:41.070 align:start position:0%
 
I

05:34:41.070 --> 05:34:41.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:46.708 --> 05:34:46.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:50.830 --> 05:34:50.840 align:start position:0%
uh okay um you know I you know what this
 
05:34:53.310 --> 05:34:53.320 align:start position:0%
how you do how's it down where this bill
 
05:34:55.390 --> 05:34:55.400 align:start position:0%
originally went to County and Municipal
 
05:34:58.190 --> 05:34:58.200 align:start position:0%
and we got it late and I mean it's it's
 
05:34:59.990 --> 05:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
in it's before Judiciary but but it was
 
05:35:02.030 --> 05:35:02.040 align:start position:0%
referred to us late I think or
 
05:35:03.470 --> 05:35:03.480 align:start position:0%
transferred and that's why we don't have
 
05:35:05.788 --> 05:35:05.798 align:start position:0%
it are there more copies back there uh
 
05:35:06.990 --> 05:35:07.000 align:start position:0%
there's more copies over there but you
 
05:35:09.510 --> 05:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
can take you have this you this no no no
 
05:35:13.310 --> 05:35:13.320 align:start position:0%

132
 
05:36:10.670 --> 05:36:10.680 align:start position:0%
and just a little background why I'm
 
05:36:12.510 --> 05:36:12.520 align:start position:0%
sort of out of my wheelhouse by being
 
05:36:14.070 --> 05:36:14.080 align:start position:0%
over here in judiciary instead of on the
 
05:36:16.070 --> 05:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
other side of the street here in
 
05:36:18.230 --> 05:36:18.240 align:start position:0%
education um I was approached by a
 
05:36:19.390 --> 05:36:19.400 align:start position:0%
citizen in
 
05:36:22.830 --> 05:36:22.840 align:start position:0%
Pont roughly last
 
05:36:27.470 --> 05:36:27.480 align:start position:0%
March and asked what do I do when we
 
05:36:28.390 --> 05:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
have a
 
05:36:31.190 --> 05:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
relative that we have not dealt with in
 
05:36:33.310 --> 05:36:33.320 align:start position:0%
this town for years and years and years
 
05:36:35.430 --> 05:36:35.440 align:start position:0%
and hasn't taken anybody's
 
05:36:40.390 --> 05:36:40.400 align:start position:0%
advice and is Rock Bottom poor right now
 
05:36:42.750 --> 05:36:42.760 align:start position:0%
and they're coming after us to support
 
05:36:42.760 --> 05:36:43.868 align:start position:0%
and they're coming after us to support
this

05:36:43.868 --> 05:36:43.878 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:36:46.030 --> 05:36:46.040 align:start position:0%
individual and they say there's this
 
05:36:47.948 --> 05:36:47.958 align:start position:0%
statute and the statute which you have
 
05:36:49.548 --> 05:36:49.558 align:start position:0%
before you that I gave you is 165
 
05:36:52.030 --> 05:36:52.040 align:start position:0%
covid-19 liability for
 
05:36:54.390 --> 05:36:54.400 align:start position:0%
support on the back side it just takes
 
05:36:57.030 --> 05:36:57.040 align:start position:0%
you roughly quickly through that process
 
05:36:59.310 --> 05:36:59.320 align:start position:0%
which this person was starting to go
 
05:37:02.230 --> 05:37:02.240 align:start position:0%
through with their select board and this
 
05:37:04.670 --> 05:37:04.680 align:start position:0%
is in the small town of Pont roughly 600
 
05:37:07.990 --> 05:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
plus uh people living in the town
 
05:37:10.788 --> 05:37:10.798 align:start position:0%
what it does is that it require and and
 
05:37:13.110 --> 05:37:13.120 align:start position:0%
this bill was developed when I looked at
 
05:37:15.830 --> 05:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
the last time it was last change in
 
05:37:19.270 --> 05:37:19.280 align:start position:0%
1986 85 prior to that where they kind of
 
05:37:21.750 --> 05:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
shrunk it down quite a bit and it was
 
05:37:24.910 --> 05:37:24.920 align:start position:0%
initially back in 1925 1933 so we're
 
05:37:27.110 --> 05:37:27.120 align:start position:0%
talking about the Dust bow days and the
 
05:37:30.270 --> 05:37:30.280 align:start position:0%
roaring roaring 20s and and what
 
05:37:34.230 --> 05:37:34.240 align:start position:0%
resulted back in the 30s um this person
 
05:37:36.190 --> 05:37:36.200 align:start position:0%
was a had a relative right there in the
 
05:37:38.110 --> 05:37:38.120 align:start position:0%
same town of pmod
 
05:37:40.628 --> 05:37:40.638 align:start position:0%
and the law re basically says right now
 
05:37:42.350 --> 05:37:42.360 align:start position:0%
if there's a relationship and they talk
 
05:37:44.270 --> 05:37:44.280 align:start position:0%
about the relationship being a father a
 
05:37:46.708 --> 05:37:46.718 align:start position:0%
mother a stepfather step mother son
 
05:37:48.230 --> 05:37:48.240 align:start position:0%
daughter husband or
 
05:37:52.868 --> 05:37:52.878 align:start position:0%
wife and it deals about the poor person
 
05:37:55.390 --> 05:37:55.400 align:start position:0%
that needs that support within that
 
05:37:58.190 --> 05:37:58.200 align:start position:0%
community and what the select board was
 
05:38:00.110 --> 05:38:00.120 align:start position:0%
tasked to do in accordance with this law
 
05:38:02.350 --> 05:38:02.360 align:start position:0%
right here it could also be a county
 
05:38:04.708 --> 05:38:04.718 align:start position:0%
commissioner or an overseer of the
 
05:38:06.390 --> 05:38:06.400 align:start position:0%
public welfare or your welfare officer
 
05:38:08.868 --> 05:38:08.878 align:start position:0%
for your town now
 
05:38:13.110 --> 05:38:13.120 align:start position:0%
would look at you and say okay you may
 
05:38:15.150 --> 05:38:15.160 align:start position:0%
have to help pay for the costs of this
 
05:38:17.670 --> 05:38:17.680 align:start position:0%
person even though the person's been
 
05:38:20.470 --> 05:38:20.480 align:start position:0%
doing everything contrary to what you
 
05:38:23.070 --> 05:38:23.080 align:start position:0%
believe in even though you haven't met
 
05:38:25.548 --> 05:38:25.558 align:start position:0%
this person in your community for months
 
05:38:29.350 --> 05:38:29.360 align:start position:0%
and years uh you are Bloodline with this
 
05:38:29.360 --> 05:38:31.190 align:start position:0%
and years uh you are Bloodline with this
particular

05:38:31.190 --> 05:38:31.200 align:start position:0%
particular
 
05:38:34.110 --> 05:38:34.120 align:start position:0%
individual and so the board then decides
 
05:38:36.468 --> 05:38:36.478 align:start position:0%
whether you have the means the wherewith
 
05:38:39.270 --> 05:38:39.280 align:start position:0%
all to help and it says right within it
 
05:38:41.628 --> 05:38:41.638 align:start position:0%
the weekly income more than sufficient
 
05:38:41.638 --> 05:38:42.468 align:start position:0%
the weekly income more than sufficient
for

05:38:42.468 --> 05:38:42.478 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:38:44.830 --> 05:38:44.840 align:start position:0%
yourself and this individual did have
 
05:38:46.548 --> 05:38:46.558 align:start position:0%
income above and
 
05:38:49.430 --> 05:38:49.440 align:start position:0%
beyond and others in the town did as
 
05:38:51.948 --> 05:38:51.958 align:start position:0%
well and had been helping and it had
 
05:38:54.070 --> 05:38:54.080 align:start position:0%
just not done a darn
 
05:38:57.468 --> 05:38:57.478 align:start position:0%
thing and so when we went when you go
 
05:39:00.548 --> 05:39:00.558 align:start position:0%
further with it then the people that are
 
05:39:02.910 --> 05:39:02.920 align:start position:0%
conducting that meeting the county
 
05:39:04.350 --> 05:39:04.360 align:start position:0%
commissioner or the selectman or the
 
05:39:06.990 --> 05:39:07.000 align:start position:0%
overseer Seer if such person refuses to
 
05:39:10.230 --> 05:39:10.240 align:start position:0%
comply why would they above order to
 
05:39:13.030 --> 05:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
help then the person shall be summoned
 
05:39:16.270 --> 05:39:16.280 align:start position:0%
to appear in court pursuant to RSA 165
 
05:39:19.310 --> 05:39:19.320 align:start position:0%
covid-19 a hearing is conducted if the
 
05:39:20.990 --> 05:39:21.000 align:start position:0%
poor person is found to be in need of
 
05:39:23.110 --> 05:39:23.120 align:start position:0%
assistance and if the relationship is
 
05:39:26.270 --> 05:39:26.280 align:start position:0%
able to render assistance the court May
 
05:39:29.150 --> 05:39:29.160 align:start position:0%
decree relation shall furnace this
 
05:39:31.350 --> 05:39:31.360 align:start position:0%
assistance but what happens if that
 
05:39:31.360 --> 05:39:32.430 align:start position:0%
assistance but what happens if that
individual

05:39:32.430 --> 05:39:32.440 align:start position:0%
individual
 
05:39:34.670 --> 05:39:34.680 align:start position:0%
refuses according to the law which you
 
05:39:37.430 --> 05:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
have in front of you right now they can
 
05:39:40.750 --> 05:39:40.760 align:start position:0%
be deemed in contempt of court and they
 
05:39:41.910 --> 05:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
can be
 
05:39:45.830 --> 05:39:45.840 align:start position:0%
imprisoned for no more than 90 days no
 
05:39:50.190 --> 05:39:50.200 align:start position:0%
fewer than 60 days um and if there is no
 
05:39:51.750 --> 05:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
relationship in town to take care of
 
05:39:53.548 --> 05:39:53.558 align:start position:0%
this it falls upon the city or the town
 
05:39:54.708 --> 05:39:54.718 align:start position:0%
take care of the
 
05:39:58.590 --> 05:39:58.600 align:start position:0%
individual so right now the the request
 
05:40:00.788 --> 05:40:00.798 align:start position:0%
you have through this is to delete the
 
05:40:03.270 --> 05:40:03.280 align:start position:0%
whole chapter there kind of outdated law
 
05:40:04.948 --> 05:40:04.958 align:start position:0%
uh we have a lot of issues going on in
 
05:40:08.468 --> 05:40:08.478 align:start position:0%
communities where people are related and
 
05:40:10.030 --> 05:40:10.040 align:start position:0%
even those families within are not
 
05:40:12.310 --> 05:40:12.320 align:start position:0%
talking with each other due to somebody
 
05:40:17.070 --> 05:40:17.080 align:start position:0%
maybe um doing some awful things and uh
 
05:40:19.390 --> 05:40:19.400 align:start position:0%
so that's the gist of what's coming
 
05:40:21.310 --> 05:40:21.320 align:start position:0%
forward to you this was an actual
 
05:40:22.990 --> 05:40:23.000 align:start position:0%
experience which occurred up there I do
 
05:40:24.830 --> 05:40:24.840 align:start position:0%
not know what the outcome was the person
 
05:40:26.468 --> 05:40:26.478 align:start position:0%
still walking around obviously wasn't
 
05:40:30.310 --> 05:40:30.320 align:start position:0%
put in jail but it's uh seems to be a
 
05:40:33.110 --> 05:40:33.120 align:start position:0%
pretty harsh you know you
 
05:40:36.430 --> 05:40:36.440 align:start position:0%
know impact on a family that just just
 
05:40:37.948 --> 05:40:37.958 align:start position:0%
you know we had these obligations to
 
05:40:39.390 --> 05:40:39.400 align:start position:0%
send our kids to college that we were
 
05:40:40.948 --> 05:40:40.958 align:start position:0%
doing this and this and this and this we
 
05:40:42.670 --> 05:40:42.680 align:start position:0%
don't have any more money to put on this
 
05:40:45.030 --> 05:40:45.040 align:start position:0%
person over here which in fact we don't
 
05:40:47.708 --> 05:40:47.718 align:start position:0%
want anything to do it but we're aligned
 
05:40:50.310 --> 05:40:50.320 align:start position:0%
by Blood thank you very much Mr chair
 
05:40:52.948 --> 05:40:52.958 align:start position:0%
and that's the gist of this conversation
 
05:40:54.788 --> 05:40:54.798 align:start position:0%
right thank you representative uh
 
05:40:56.670 --> 05:40:56.680 align:start position:0%
representative Mo please yes thank you
 
05:40:58.350 --> 05:40:58.360 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for the question uh
 
05:41:02.430 --> 05:41:02.440 align:start position:0%
it says um rarely used can you quantify
 
05:41:05.030 --> 05:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
rarely I I have not when I presented
 
05:41:06.430 --> 05:41:06.440 align:start position:0%
this to the people over across the
 
05:41:08.910 --> 05:41:08.920 align:start position:0%
street at o and the researchers they
 
05:41:10.868 --> 05:41:10.878 align:start position:0%
went through and said wow we really
 
05:41:13.548 --> 05:41:13.558 align:start position:0%
don't know much about this in fact it
 
05:41:15.468 --> 05:41:15.478 align:start position:0%
really belongs you know out of the
 
05:41:17.110 --> 05:41:17.120 align:start position:0%
statute because it's it's kind of
 
05:41:19.390 --> 05:41:19.400 align:start position:0%
outdated the way this is done there's so
 
05:41:22.030 --> 05:41:22.040 align:start position:0%
much transy now in our in our society
 
05:41:25.110 --> 05:41:25.120 align:start position:0%
and um I'm not I'm not saying that we
 
05:41:27.750 --> 05:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be helping people but I don't
 
05:41:30.190 --> 05:41:30.200 align:start position:0%
think it should be necessarily placed on
 
05:41:32.948 --> 05:41:32.958 align:start position:0%
that family uh but I can't tell you
 
05:41:35.468 --> 05:41:35.478 align:start position:0%
specifically when it was last used if in
 
05:41:37.830 --> 05:41:37.840 align:start position:0%
fact it was even used other than what I
 
05:41:39.708 --> 05:41:39.718 align:start position:0%
see in what happened at one time in
 
05:41:42.868 --> 05:41:42.878 align:start position:0%
permont followup quick followup so this
 
05:41:44.708 --> 05:41:44.718 align:start position:0%
is kind of like one of those antiqua
 
05:41:46.310 --> 05:41:46.320 align:start position:0%
rules you can't have more than 20
 
05:41:48.270 --> 05:41:48.280 align:start position:0%
chickens living in your house or some
 
05:41:49.628 --> 05:41:49.638 align:start position:0%
you know something ridiculous that
 
05:41:51.510 --> 05:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
nobody ever enforces because doesn't
 
05:41:53.910 --> 05:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
happen we have a lot of this actually if
 
05:41:55.590 --> 05:41:55.600 align:start position:0%
you look hard at our statutes you're
 
05:41:57.270 --> 05:41:57.280 align:start position:0%
going to come across these things which
 
05:41:59.670 --> 05:41:59.680 align:start position:0%
occur and somebody digs it out and uses
 
05:42:02.510 --> 05:42:02.520 align:start position:0%
it applies it once or twice and here we
 
05:42:04.310 --> 05:42:04.320 align:start position:0%
are all right representative orgon you
 
05:42:06.910 --> 05:42:06.920 align:start position:0%
had a question um yes would you believe
 
05:42:09.270 --> 05:42:09.280 align:start position:0%
that is law is probably even older than
 
05:42:12.110 --> 05:42:12.120 align:start position:0%
1925 I think the thing they found 1925
 
05:42:13.670 --> 05:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
is like something they passed as a
 
05:42:15.628 --> 05:42:15.638 align:start position:0%
chapter law rather than as that's
 
05:42:18.190 --> 05:42:18.200 align:start position:0%
exactly what it says so RS 668 is
 
05:42:20.590 --> 05:42:20.600 align:start position:0%
probably much older even than 19 you're
 
05:42:22.708 --> 05:42:22.718 align:start position:0%
probably correct yeah all right other
 
05:42:25.150 --> 05:42:25.160 align:start position:0%
questions for this witness seeing none
 
05:42:26.750 --> 05:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
thank you much thank you very much
 
05:42:29.310 --> 05:42:29.320 align:start position:0%
representative lad next I'm gonna call
 
05:42:34.990 --> 05:42:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:37.310 --> 05:42:37.320 align:start position:0%
please good afternoon Mr chairman
 
05:42:39.150 --> 05:42:39.160 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I'm Steve Tower
 
05:42:42.350 --> 05:42:42.360 align:start position:0%
with New Hampshire Legal Assistant um I
 
05:42:44.910 --> 05:42:44.920 align:start position:0%
sort of head all of our involvement in
 
05:42:46.910 --> 05:42:46.920 align:start position:0%
the local Welfare Law at nhla so I'm
 
05:42:49.190 --> 05:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
sort of our local expert on it uh we are
 
05:42:51.150 --> 05:42:51.160 align:start position:0%
not taking a position in favor or in
 
05:42:53.510 --> 05:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
opposition of this bill um but I did
 
05:42:55.468 --> 05:42:55.478 align:start position:0%
want to testify to provide some
 
05:42:57.990 --> 05:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
additional information having spoken to
 
05:42:59.510 --> 05:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
Mr Marsh behind me who will be
 
05:43:01.510 --> 05:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
testifying later on I think a lot of
 
05:43:02.948 --> 05:43:02.958 align:start position:0%
what my plan testimony would be
 
05:43:05.070 --> 05:43:05.080 align:start position:0%
duplicative so I'll just keep it short
 
05:43:10.030 --> 05:43:10.040 align:start position:0%
um in addition to uh RSA 165 colon 19
 
05:43:11.750 --> 05:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
which identifies the legally liable
 
05:43:13.230 --> 05:43:13.240 align:start position:0%
relatives and includes this language
 
05:43:15.750 --> 05:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
about being able to enforce the
 
05:43:21.190 --> 05:43:21.200 align:start position:0%
liability RSA 165 colon 20 also allows
 
05:43:24.230 --> 05:43:24.240 align:start position:0%
towns to be reimbursed for expenses that
 
05:43:26.310 --> 05:43:26.320 align:start position:0%
were incurred from Legally liable
 
05:43:28.750 --> 05:43:28.760 align:start position:0%
relatives so were this section of the
 
05:43:31.510 --> 05:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
statute to be repealed um I think RSA
 
05:43:33.708 --> 05:43:33.718 align:start position:0%
165 colon 20 would also need to be
 
05:43:33.718 --> 05:43:35.230 align:start position:0%
165 colon 20 would also need to be
amended

05:43:35.230 --> 05:43:35.240 align:start position:0%
amended
 
05:43:38.430 --> 05:43:38.440 align:start position:0%
um uh beyond that I'll just state that
 
05:43:39.788 --> 05:43:39.798 align:start position:0%
back in
 
05:43:43.590 --> 05:43:43.600 align:start position:0%
2021 um I sent out a number of 91a
 
05:43:47.110 --> 05:43:47.120 align:start position:0%
information requests to towns to ask an
 
05:43:49.190 --> 05:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
just kind of get a feel for how the
 
05:43:51.110 --> 05:43:51.120 align:start position:0%
local Welfare Law is working in
 
05:43:52.830 --> 05:43:52.840 align:start position:0%
different parts of the state I sent them
 
05:43:54.628 --> 05:43:54.638 align:start position:0%
out to Major municipalities and then a
 
05:43:56.708 --> 05:43:56.718 align:start position:0%
handful of the smaller municipalities I
 
05:43:59.788 --> 05:43:59.798 align:start position:0%
sent out about 50 and all and one of the
 
05:44:01.830 --> 05:44:01.840 align:start position:0%
questions I asked was had any Town ever
 
05:44:03.990 --> 05:44:04.000 align:start position:0%
recovered expenses from a legally liable
 
05:44:06.788 --> 05:44:06.798 align:start position:0%
relative in the last 10 years under RSA
 
05:44:10.990 --> 05:44:11.000 align:start position:0%
col 20 um and uh all of the towns that
 
05:44:13.948 --> 05:44:13.958 align:start position:0%
responded stated that they had not so I
 
05:44:15.708 --> 05:44:15.718 align:start position:0%
think at a minimum there's not a lot of
 
05:44:17.510 --> 05:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
going to the courts to enforce the
 
05:44:20.548 --> 05:44:20.558 align:start position:0%
legally liable relative um but as uh Mr
 
05:44:23.270 --> 05:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
Marsh will probably testify towns do
 
05:44:25.110 --> 05:44:25.120 align:start position:0%
sometimes use the existence of the
 
05:44:27.310 --> 05:44:27.320 align:start position:0%
statute to call up legally liable
 
05:44:29.948 --> 05:44:29.958 align:start position:0%
relatives and say hey can you take this
 
05:44:31.548 --> 05:44:31.558 align:start position:0%
person in give them shelter so that
 
05:44:34.190 --> 05:44:34.200 align:start position:0%
we're not paying for it um if you don't
 
05:44:35.990 --> 05:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
we technically could go after you even
 
05:44:39.510 --> 05:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
if a town generally won't um so I think
 
05:44:41.110 --> 05:44:41.120 align:start position:0%
that's the extent of my testimony if
 
05:44:42.590 --> 05:44:42.600 align:start position:0%
anyone had any questions I'm happy to
 
05:44:45.350 --> 05:44:45.360 align:start position:0%
answer them um but you know I'm sorry
 
05:44:47.548 --> 05:44:47.558 align:start position:0%
could could you just uh I think
 
05:44:49.590 --> 05:44:49.600 align:start position:0%
representative lad referenced it but I
 
05:44:51.390 --> 05:44:51.400 align:start position:0%
to be honest I've forgotten exactly the
 
05:44:53.150 --> 05:44:53.160 align:start position:0%
Lang the language you use who are the
 
05:44:56.070 --> 05:44:56.080 align:start position:0%
people that are what is the scope of the
 
05:44:58.788 --> 05:44:58.798 align:start position:0%
relative relationship that uh makes you
 
05:45:02.830 --> 05:45:02.840 align:start position:0%
subject to the statute um it is it's um
 
05:45:06.070 --> 05:45:06.080 align:start position:0%
oh thank you mother father son daughter
 
05:45:09.230 --> 05:45:09.240 align:start position:0%
brother sister I believe okay
 
05:45:14.590 --> 05:45:14.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:17.350 --> 05:45:17.360 align:start position:0%
okay right right right right right right
 
05:45:19.670 --> 05:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
right and and there are certain
 
05:45:24.310 --> 05:45:24.320 align:start position:0%
situations where a person who uh may
 
05:45:26.350 --> 05:45:26.360 align:start position:0%
have that relationship connection but
 
05:45:28.670 --> 05:45:28.680 align:start position:0%
say you know they grew up in abusive
 
05:45:30.390 --> 05:45:30.400 align:start position:0%
household and they they haven't spoken
 
05:45:34.390 --> 05:45:34.400 align:start position:0%
to their family in 30 years or perhaps
 
05:45:37.548 --> 05:45:37.558 align:start position:0%
the legally liable mother of somebody
 
05:45:40.390 --> 05:45:40.400 align:start position:0%
um their child is battling in an
 
05:45:42.390 --> 05:45:42.400 align:start position:0%
addiction and has previously taken all
 
05:45:44.390 --> 05:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
of their jewelry and pwned it and so
 
05:45:45.910 --> 05:45:45.920 align:start position:0%
there's you know a breakdown in the
 
05:45:48.310 --> 05:45:48.320 align:start position:0%
relationship in that way so
 
05:45:51.190 --> 05:45:51.200 align:start position:0%
um sometimes there isn't that tight
 
05:45:54.150 --> 05:45:54.160 align:start position:0%
family connection that uh I
 
05:45:57.468 --> 05:45:57.478 align:start position:0%
think it may be imagined when this bill
 
05:46:01.468 --> 05:46:01.478 align:start position:0%
was passed um but um I'm sure everyone
 
05:46:03.868 --> 05:46:03.878 align:start position:0%
could imagine the situations where maybe
 
05:46:06.430 --> 05:46:06.440 align:start position:0%
not everyone in a family gets along
 
05:46:08.468 --> 05:46:08.478 align:start position:0%
super well all right questions questions
 
05:46:09.390 --> 05:46:09.400 align:start position:0%
for this
 
05:46:11.750 --> 05:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you very much
 
05:46:23.830 --> 05:46:23.840 align:start position:0%

following however according to the local

welfare administrators Association the
 
05:46:52.670 --> 05:46:52.680 align:start position:0%
provision is sometimes used but
 
05:46:54.468 --> 05:46:54.478 align:start position:0%
infrequently I am the President of the
 
05:46:55.990 --> 05:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire local Welfare Association
 
05:46:58.750 --> 05:46:58.760 align:start position:0%
as I stated and I will plainly State I
 
05:47:00.670 --> 05:47:00.680 align:start position:0%
am not aware nor is our board of
 
05:47:02.510 --> 05:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
directors aware of being formally
 
05:47:05.110 --> 05:47:05.120 align:start position:0%
consulted regarding the bill um so I
 
05:47:07.948 --> 05:47:07.958 align:start position:0%
appreciate being here today
 
05:47:10.670 --> 05:47:10.680 align:start position:0%
um at a time of increasing assistance
 
05:47:12.750 --> 05:47:12.760 align:start position:0%
expenditures for
 
05:47:15.030 --> 05:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
municipalities uh we should not
 
05:47:17.468 --> 05:47:17.478 align:start position:0%
eliminate a reimbursement option to
 
05:47:20.868 --> 05:47:20.878 align:start position:0%
municipalities that has existed for many
 
05:47:25.548 --> 05:47:25.558 align:start position:0%
decades um although it may be used
 
05:47:28.830 --> 05:47:28.840 align:start position:0%
infrequently um it is used
 
05:47:31.788 --> 05:47:31.798 align:start position:0%
frequently enough to maintain an
 
05:47:33.708 --> 05:47:33.718 align:start position:0%
important reimbursement option for
 
05:47:37.468 --> 05:47:37.478 align:start position:0%
municipalities um for local taxpayers
 
05:47:39.430 --> 05:47:39.440 align:start position:0%
it is vital to allow municipalities to
 
05:47:41.350 --> 05:47:41.360 align:start position:0%
seek reimbursement from legal legally
 
05:47:44.310 --> 05:47:44.320 align:start position:0%
liable legally liable relatives in the
 
05:47:46.110 --> 05:47:46.120 align:start position:0%
line of as it was indicated father
 
05:47:48.670 --> 05:47:48.680 align:start position:0%
mother stepfather stepfather um
 
05:47:51.310 --> 05:47:51.320 align:start position:0%
stepfather stepmother adult son adult
 
05:47:54.390 --> 05:47:54.400 align:start position:0%
daughter husband or wife as long as
 
05:47:57.230 --> 05:47:57.240 align:start position:0%
reimbursement does not cause financial
 
05:47:57.240 --> 05:47:58.948 align:start position:0%
reimbursement does not cause financial
hardship

05:47:58.948 --> 05:47:58.958 align:start position:0%
hardship
 
05:48:02.030 --> 05:48:02.040 align:start position:0%
um on that legally liable relative
 
05:48:04.070 --> 05:48:04.080 align:start position:0%
meaning the reimbursement does not cause
 
05:48:06.548 --> 05:48:06.558 align:start position:0%
an inability for that relative to pay
 
05:48:08.110 --> 05:48:08.120 align:start position:0%
the basic Livy
 
05:48:10.670 --> 05:48:10.680 align:start position:0%
expenses in that situation reimbursement
 
05:48:11.750 --> 05:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
is not
 
05:48:14.350 --> 05:48:14.360 align:start position:0%
sought um the current
 
05:48:16.910 --> 05:48:16.920 align:start position:0%
law um the value of the current law
 
05:48:18.830 --> 05:48:18.840 align:start position:0%
Beyond simply the actual
 
05:48:18.840 --> 05:48:20.788 align:start position:0%
Beyond simply the actual
reimbursement

05:48:20.788 --> 05:48:20.798 align:start position:0%
reimbursement
 
05:48:24.150 --> 05:48:24.160 align:start position:0%
um but the potential the value of it is
 
05:48:26.468 --> 05:48:26.478 align:start position:0%
the potential a municipality could seek
 
05:48:28.070 --> 05:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
reimbursement from Legally liable
 
05:48:31.110 --> 05:48:31.120 align:start position:0%
relatives why because the close family
 
05:48:33.390 --> 05:48:33.400 align:start position:0%
members mentioned are often likely to
 
05:48:35.670 --> 05:48:35.680 align:start position:0%
assist their family member in need with
 
05:48:38.990 --> 05:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
just the prospect of the municipality uh
 
05:48:40.390 --> 05:48:40.400 align:start position:0%
could seek
 
05:48:42.390 --> 05:48:42.400 align:start position:0%
reimbursement uh types of assistance
 
05:48:44.150 --> 05:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
when reimbursement is either discussed
 
05:48:47.310 --> 05:48:47.320 align:start position:0%
or actively sought the most are unhal
 
05:48:49.868 --> 05:48:49.878 align:start position:0%
situations um as indicated we we are we
 
05:48:51.708 --> 05:48:51.718 align:start position:0%
try to be very sensitive about that is
 
05:48:54.830 --> 05:48:54.840 align:start position:0%
is domestic violence involved sexual uh
 
05:48:57.670 --> 05:48:57.680 align:start position:0%
harassment violence um so we practice
 
05:48:57.680 --> 05:48:59.310 align:start position:0%
harassment violence um so we practice
situational

05:48:59.310 --> 05:48:59.320 align:start position:0%
situational
 
05:49:02.190 --> 05:49:02.200 align:start position:0%
flexibility um Municipal welfare
 
05:49:04.590 --> 05:49:04.600 align:start position:0%
practices flexible decision- making as I
 
05:49:06.788 --> 05:49:06.798 align:start position:0%
indicated when deciding to use legal
 
05:49:09.310 --> 05:49:09.320 align:start position:0%
legally liable relative the the legally
 
05:49:11.590 --> 05:49:11.600 align:start position:0%
liable relative law which is often based
 
05:49:14.070 --> 05:49:14.080 align:start position:0%
on family Dynamics including known or
 
05:49:16.190 --> 05:49:16.200 align:start position:0%
unknown where it's a family we're not
 
05:49:17.830 --> 05:49:17.840 align:start position:0%
going to spend two months trying to
 
05:49:20.310 --> 05:49:20.320 align:start position:0%
locate um an adult son that lives in
 
05:49:24.110 --> 05:49:24.120 align:start position:0%
Arizona somewhere
 
05:49:27.708 --> 05:49:27.718 align:start position:0%
um for reimbursements meaning we we may
 
05:49:29.510 --> 05:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
not contact and we likely will not
 
05:49:32.708 --> 05:49:32.718 align:start position:0%
contact a family member if a resident is
 
05:49:35.190 --> 05:49:35.200 align:start position:0%
seeking assistance with $125 for an
 
05:49:37.430 --> 05:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
electric bill because of a disconnect
 
05:49:40.190 --> 05:49:40.200 align:start position:0%
status uh but we may for emergency
 
05:49:43.468 --> 05:49:43.478 align:start position:0%
housing extended rental payments burial
 
05:49:46.948 --> 05:49:46.958 align:start position:0%
cremation assistance due to the
 
05:49:49.788 --> 05:49:49.798 align:start position:0%
cost maintaining the option for
 
05:49:52.350 --> 05:49:52.360 align:start position:0%
municipalities including the taxpayers
 
05:49:53.830 --> 05:49:53.840 align:start position:0%
that pay for
 
05:49:56.190 --> 05:49:56.200 align:start position:0%
assistance uh to seek reimbursement is
 
05:49:58.708 --> 05:49:58.718 align:start position:0%
important to minimize cost to
 
05:50:01.070 --> 05:50:01.080 align:start position:0%
taxpayers with minimal effect on the
 
05:50:02.948 --> 05:50:02.958 align:start position:0%
applicant because it has no effect on
 
05:50:05.230 --> 05:50:05.240 align:start position:0%
the bearing of the decision that we make
 
05:50:08.468 --> 05:50:08.478 align:start position:0%
on the applicant
 
05:50:11.310 --> 05:50:11.320 align:start position:0%
um the association representing the
 
05:50:13.350 --> 05:50:13.360 align:start position:0%
municipal Welfare Offices throughout the
 
05:50:16.430 --> 05:50:16.440 align:start position:0%
state ask you to oppose this
 
05:50:19.390 --> 05:50:19.400 align:start position:0%
well-intended and I and I believe it is
 
05:50:22.788 --> 05:50:22.798 align:start position:0%
but I think too many con but full of
 
05:50:26.030 --> 05:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
consequences bill in front of you right
 
05:50:26.040 --> 05:50:27.868 align:start position:0%
consequences bill in front of you right
representative

05:50:27.868 --> 05:50:27.878 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:50:30.548 --> 05:50:30.558 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you so much for for being
 
05:50:35.230 --> 05:50:35.240 align:start position:0%
here um I'm a little confused and and
 
05:50:39.310 --> 05:50:39.320 align:start position:0%
maybe well maybe I'm tired um no
 
05:50:42.110 --> 05:50:42.120 align:start position:0%
actually I am tired so that I'm not
 
05:50:47.310 --> 05:50:47.320 align:start position:0%
confused about um can you tell me um go
 
05:50:50.670 --> 05:50:50.680 align:start position:0%
back two years 5 years 10 years 20 years
 
05:50:52.990 --> 05:50:53.000 align:start position:0%
exactly how many
 
05:50:55.788 --> 05:50:55.798 align:start position:0%
times uh welfare
 
05:50:59.070 --> 05:50:59.080 align:start position:0%
administrators have in fact used this to
 
05:50:59.080 --> 05:51:00.990 align:start position:0%
administrators have in fact used this to
collect

05:51:00.990 --> 05:51:01.000 align:start position:0%
collect
 
05:51:04.070 --> 05:51:04.080 align:start position:0%
money I cannot give you numbers because
 
05:51:07.310 --> 05:51:07.320 align:start position:0%
it's not collected what I can state
 
05:51:09.670 --> 05:51:09.680 align:start position:0%
um is that having consulted our board of
 
05:51:11.830 --> 05:51:11.840 align:start position:0%
directors which is made up of both large
 
05:51:13.110 --> 05:51:13.120 align:start position:0%
and small
 
05:51:15.708 --> 05:51:15.718 align:start position:0%
municipalities um that they were very
 
05:51:18.070 --> 05:51:18.080 align:start position:0%
clear that we should be opposing this
 
05:51:21.910 --> 05:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
bill um that it may not be used on a
 
05:51:24.590 --> 05:51:24.600 align:start position:0%
daily basis but it is
 
05:51:28.708 --> 05:51:28.718 align:start position:0%
used um and often times it's the mention
 
05:51:30.910 --> 05:51:30.920 align:start position:0%
of as it was indicated earlier that this
 
05:51:34.150 --> 05:51:34.160 align:start position:0%
law exists that may result in a family
 
05:51:37.150 --> 05:51:37.160 align:start position:0%
member a close family member
 
05:51:40.430 --> 05:51:40.440 align:start position:0%
um rethinking and and um deciding to
 
05:51:43.230 --> 05:51:43.240 align:start position:0%
potentially assist their family member
 
05:51:46.190 --> 05:51:46.200 align:start position:0%
um who was in need and if they cannot
 
05:51:48.270 --> 05:51:48.280 align:start position:0%
then the person will come into our
 
05:51:51.628 --> 05:51:51.638 align:start position:0%
office if I could just follow up um I
 
05:51:54.628 --> 05:51:54.638 align:start position:0%
read the fiscal note I read it twice I
 
05:51:56.430 --> 05:51:56.440 align:start position:0%
then actually gave my copy to someone
 
05:51:58.868 --> 05:51:58.878 align:start position:0%
else so I don't I maybe because I'm
 
05:52:01.510 --> 05:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
tired I don't remember but it seemed to
 
05:52:04.750 --> 05:52:04.760 align:start position:0%
indicate that there was basically what
 
05:52:08.310 --> 05:52:08.320 align:start position:0%
is known in the vernacular as di
 
05:52:10.628 --> 05:52:10.638 align:start position:0%
Minimus um
 
05:52:15.190 --> 05:52:15.200 align:start position:0%
Financial uh return in this is that
 
05:52:18.430 --> 05:52:18.440 align:start position:0%
incorrect are you saying that the only
 
05:52:21.590 --> 05:52:21.600 align:start position:0%
are you the only thing that this is good
 
05:52:25.030 --> 05:52:25.040 align:start position:0%
for is to remind
 
05:52:27.230 --> 05:52:27.240 align:start position:0%
people if reminding people that they
 
05:52:29.430 --> 05:52:29.440 align:start position:0%
have an obligation to their family if
 
05:52:31.510 --> 05:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
that's not quite enough but to say to
 
05:52:33.948 --> 05:52:33.958 align:start position:0%
them they might
 
05:52:36.948 --> 05:52:36.958 align:start position:0%
be I guess the language from the period
 
05:52:38.788 --> 05:52:38.798 align:start position:0%
is they might be putting the
 
05:52:43.468 --> 05:52:43.478 align:start position:0%
hcal um that that causes them to do
 
05:52:45.628 --> 05:52:45.638 align:start position:0%
something that they wouldn't otherwise
 
05:52:48.948 --> 05:52:48.958 align:start position:0%
do I would state that
 
05:52:52.868 --> 05:52:52.878 align:start position:0%
um if this bill was to pass yes um there
 
05:52:55.910 --> 05:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
would be a cost to to the municipalities
 
05:52:57.150 --> 05:52:57.160 align:start position:0%
due due to the reasons that you
 
05:53:00.190 --> 05:53:00.200 align:start position:0%
indicated there are family members it it
 
05:53:02.910 --> 05:53:02.920 align:start position:0%
is there are family members that do
 
05:53:05.708 --> 05:53:05.718 align:start position:0%
assist because of the law because of a
 
05:53:07.350 --> 05:53:07.360 align:start position:0%
letter that may be sent out they
 
05:53:10.788 --> 05:53:10.798 align:start position:0%
absolutely do um but then why can't you
 
05:53:13.350 --> 05:53:13.360 align:start position:0%
give me any numbers to tell me how much
 
05:53:15.910 --> 05:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
money has come in because of this it's
 
05:53:17.468 --> 05:53:17.478 align:start position:0%
challenging to do because I'm sorry I
 
05:53:19.830 --> 05:53:19.840 align:start position:0%
apologize that's okay I I appreciate the
 
05:53:22.190 --> 05:53:22.200 align:start position:0%
I I appreciate the question
 
05:53:24.310 --> 05:53:24.320 align:start position:0%
um because of the nature of local
 
05:53:26.150 --> 05:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
welfare throughout the state it would be
 
05:53:29.468 --> 05:53:29.478 align:start position:0%
very challenging to get those numbers
 
05:53:31.590 --> 05:53:31.600 align:start position:0%
especially in the time that really that
 
05:53:34.750 --> 05:53:34.760 align:start position:0%
I had but um but we do represent local
 
05:53:36.830 --> 05:53:36.840 align:start position:0%
welfare departments throughout the state
 
05:53:39.708 --> 05:53:39.718 align:start position:0%
large cities small towns some towns use
 
05:53:43.230 --> 05:53:43.240 align:start position:0%
it more than others um but it would be
 
05:53:45.708 --> 05:53:45.718 align:start position:0%
at a cost to can I give you a quick
 
05:53:48.548 --> 05:53:48.558 align:start position:0%
example of a situation if you don't mind
 
05:53:53.070 --> 05:53:53.080 align:start position:0%
okay thank you um for um I'll use the
 
05:53:53.948 --> 05:53:53.958 align:start position:0%
city of
 
05:53:59.510 --> 05:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
Rochester uh if a if an if an adult son
 
05:54:00.708 --> 05:54:00.718 align:start position:0%
comes into our
 
05:54:04.868 --> 05:54:04.878 align:start position:0%
office um unfortunately seeking burial
 
05:54:07.390 --> 05:54:07.400 align:start position:0%
Assistance or cremation assistance
 
05:54:10.110 --> 05:54:10.120 align:start position:0%
um for his
 
05:54:14.670 --> 05:54:14.680 align:start position:0%
mom um we will um after you have a good
 
05:54:17.590 --> 05:54:17.600 align:start position:0%
conversation we will thoughtfully remind
 
05:54:20.110 --> 05:54:20.120 align:start position:0%
of the it is in our application of the
 
05:54:22.430 --> 05:54:22.440 align:start position:0%
law um and that they do have a right to
 
05:54:25.230 --> 05:54:25.240 align:start position:0%
come in if they cannot afford to pay
 
05:54:28.270 --> 05:54:28.280 align:start position:0%
themselves um and however I would say
 
05:54:30.590 --> 05:54:30.600 align:start position:0%
about half the time they come into our
 
05:54:33.030 --> 05:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
office because I think they they have a
 
05:54:34.750 --> 05:54:34.760 align:start position:0%
chance to think and
 
05:54:37.548 --> 05:54:37.558 align:start position:0%
pause and uh they can self-pay
 
05:54:40.670 --> 05:54:40.680 align:start position:0%
themselves they will um whereas if the
 
05:54:43.868 --> 05:54:43.878 align:start position:0%
law did not exist it could change that
 
05:54:46.430 --> 05:54:46.440 align:start position:0%
Dynamic right and if they can't pay it
 
05:54:48.868 --> 05:54:48.878 align:start position:0%
they can come into our office absolutely
 
05:54:50.150 --> 05:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
all right representative Morton and then
 
05:54:54.110 --> 05:54:54.120 align:start position:0%
representative tur so um so you say that
 
05:54:56.270 --> 05:54:56.280 align:start position:0%
it's not collected as far as the numbers
 
05:54:59.590 --> 05:54:59.600 align:start position:0%
um and this applies to people of every
 
05:55:02.030 --> 05:55:02.040 align:start position:0%
age that being said I'll I'll give some
 
05:55:04.190 --> 05:55:04.200 align:start position:0%
statistics we know that 10,000 Americans
 
05:55:06.830 --> 05:55:06.840 align:start position:0%
every day turn 65 and and we know that
 
05:55:09.350 --> 05:55:09.360 align:start position:0%
there's a a growing number of elderly
 
05:55:11.910 --> 05:55:11.920 align:start position:0%
people and 70% of people over the age of
 
05:55:14.590 --> 05:55:14.600 align:start position:0%
65 will need long-term care that would
 
05:55:16.548 --> 05:55:16.558 align:start position:0%
be something that would fall into this
 
05:55:19.788 --> 05:55:19.798 align:start position:0%
only 16% of people above the age of 65
 
05:55:23.910 --> 05:55:23.920 align:start position:0%
have insurance to pay for that um a very
 
05:55:26.190 --> 05:55:26.200 align:start position:0%
small percentage probably less than 10%
 
05:55:28.468 --> 05:55:28.478 align:start position:0%
can financially afford it themselves so
 
05:55:30.310 --> 05:55:30.320 align:start position:0%
that's where Medicaid would kick in
 
05:55:32.230 --> 05:55:32.240 align:start position:0%
question here yeah absolutely because
 
05:55:35.270 --> 05:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
the vast majority I I do long-term care
 
05:55:36.788 --> 05:55:36.798 align:start position:0%
insurance for living so
 
05:55:39.708 --> 05:55:39.718 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of people who receive
 
05:55:43.868 --> 05:55:43.878 align:start position:0%
care and some younger people as well get
 
05:55:46.430 --> 05:55:46.440 align:start position:0%
that care from family members so is is
 
05:55:49.190 --> 05:55:49.200 align:start position:0%
your point being that the people find
 
05:55:51.468 --> 05:55:51.478 align:start position:0%
out that the family member needs care
 
05:55:54.150 --> 05:55:54.160 align:start position:0%
because they've been you know um they
 
05:55:55.628 --> 05:55:55.638 align:start position:0%
haven't been in contact with each other
 
05:55:57.510 --> 05:55:57.520 align:start position:0%
for a while or whatever and that's
 
05:56:00.628 --> 05:56:00.638 align:start position:0%
helped put people back together and help
 
05:56:02.230 --> 05:56:02.240 align:start position:0%
them get that care because the vast
 
05:56:04.670 --> 05:56:04.680 align:start position:0%
majority do get care from family members
 
05:56:07.670 --> 05:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
statistically I will say well in a in a
 
05:56:10.788 --> 05:56:10.798 align:start position:0%
past career life I also sold long-ter
 
05:56:13.468 --> 05:56:13.478 align:start position:0%
care insurance 20 plus years ago that
 
05:56:15.590 --> 05:56:15.600 align:start position:0%
was very difficult to sell by the way
 
05:56:16.750 --> 05:56:16.760 align:start position:0%
because nobody believes they're going to
 
05:56:20.190 --> 05:56:20.200 align:start position:0%
a nursing home and anyway um I I should
 
05:56:21.670 --> 05:56:21.680 align:start position:0%
state that New Hampshire local welfare
 
05:56:24.750 --> 05:56:24.760 align:start position:0%
does not pay for long-term care um for
 
05:56:28.990 --> 05:56:29.000 align:start position:0%
for that kind of service um so I think
 
05:56:30.948 --> 05:56:30.958 align:start position:0%
that would that would not be an issue
 
05:56:32.510 --> 05:56:32.520 align:start position:0%
all right representative
 
05:56:35.270 --> 05:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
tur yeah thanks um thanks for taking the
 
05:56:37.230 --> 05:56:37.240 align:start position:0%
question I'm just curious just given the
 
05:56:40.948 --> 05:56:40.958 align:start position:0%
age I guess that we've heard of this uh
 
05:56:44.430 --> 05:56:44.440 align:start position:0%
law um how does it interact with sort of
 
05:56:46.310 --> 05:56:46.320 align:start position:0%
the programs that have been put in place
 
05:56:48.030 --> 05:56:48.040 align:start position:0%
particularly at the federal level since
 
05:56:51.788 --> 05:56:51.798 align:start position:0%
then like TANF and and um the other the
 
05:56:54.150 --> 05:56:54.160 align:start position:0%
other supports that are meant to sort of
 
05:56:57.350 --> 05:56:57.360 align:start position:0%
supplement people's needs oh thank you
 
05:56:59.670 --> 05:56:59.680 align:start position:0%
for the question it does not directly
 
05:57:01.990 --> 05:57:02.000 align:start position:0%
interact with tanif and and state
 
05:57:04.270 --> 05:57:04.280 align:start position:0%
Services it is more targeted towards
 
05:57:06.270 --> 05:57:06.280 align:start position:0%
local welfare
 
05:57:06.280 --> 05:57:08.590 align:start position:0%
local welfare
representative

05:57:08.590 --> 05:57:08.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:57:10.788 --> 05:57:10.798 align:start position:0%
bur thank you Mr
 
05:57:15.030 --> 05:57:15.040 align:start position:0%
chair um I want to follow up first with
 
05:57:18.030 --> 05:57:18.040 align:start position:0%
representative Smith's question uh
 
05:57:22.628 --> 05:57:22.638 align:start position:0%
because the way this seems to work is if
 
05:57:27.190 --> 05:57:27.200 align:start position:0%
somebody's asked to pay and doesn't wish
 
05:57:33.110 --> 05:57:33.120 align:start position:0%
to they uh shall be uh summoned into
 
05:57:37.548 --> 05:57:37.558 align:start position:0%
court uh if you folks or Commissioners
 
05:57:40.270 --> 05:57:40.280 align:start position:0%
whoever request it right so do we have a
 
05:57:42.948 --> 05:57:42.958 align:start position:0%
number of how many people have gone
 
05:57:45.868 --> 05:57:45.878 align:start position:0%
through the court
 
05:57:49.030 --> 05:57:49.040 align:start position:0%
process that should be easily determined
 
05:57:54.868 --> 05:57:54.878 align:start position:0%
right I do not I I do not um the the
 
05:57:57.468 --> 05:57:57.478 align:start position:0%
it's I don't have I do not have access
 
05:58:00.390 --> 05:58:00.400 align:start position:0%
to the individual municipalities if I
 
05:58:01.948 --> 05:58:01.958 align:start position:0%
had more time perhaps we could come up
 
05:58:04.030 --> 05:58:04.040 align:start position:0%
with that um I just we just don't have
 
05:58:05.670 --> 05:58:05.680 align:start position:0%
those do you have a sense whether it's
 
05:58:09.788 --> 05:58:09.798 align:start position:0%
in one digigit tw digigit three-digit
 
05:58:13.270 --> 05:58:13.280 align:start position:0%
number as far as municipalities as far
 
05:58:15.190 --> 05:58:15.200 align:start position:0%
as people that actually go take people
 
05:58:17.510 --> 05:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
to court summon to court under this
 
05:58:21.670 --> 05:58:21.680 align:start position:0%
section yeah I would say municipalities
 
05:58:24.510 --> 05:58:24.520 align:start position:0%
that um follow
 
05:58:27.270 --> 05:58:27.280 align:start position:0%
through uh not
 
05:58:31.270 --> 05:58:31.280 align:start position:0%
many so would it be a so would is is a
 
05:58:33.430 --> 05:58:33.440 align:start position:0%
would it be a fair characterization of
 
05:58:36.310 --> 05:58:36.320 align:start position:0%
your testimony that municipalities kind
 
05:58:37.670 --> 05:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
of like this
 
05:58:37.680 --> 05:58:39.350 align:start position:0%
of like this
law

05:58:39.350 --> 05:58:39.360 align:start position:0%
law
 
05:58:42.670 --> 05:58:42.680 align:start position:0%
because even though it's very unlikely
 
05:58:44.350 --> 05:58:44.360 align:start position:0%
that they're ever going to try to carry
 
05:58:46.670 --> 05:58:46.680 align:start position:0%
through on it it gives them a little bit
 
05:58:49.310 --> 05:58:49.320 align:start position:0%
of a hammer to for lack of this is my
 
05:58:51.110 --> 05:58:51.120 align:start position:0%
term not yours but for lack of a for
 
05:58:53.590 --> 05:58:53.600 align:start position:0%
lack of a better term to some extent at
 
05:58:57.510 --> 05:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
least coer or persuade people that you
 
05:59:00.070 --> 05:59:00.080 align:start position:0%
know um you better you ought to pay up
 
05:59:02.830 --> 05:59:02.840 align:start position:0%
because if not we could take it to court
 
05:59:02.840 --> 05:59:04.430 align:start position:0%
because if not we could take it to court
right

05:59:04.430 --> 05:59:04.440 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:59:06.830 --> 05:59:06.840 align:start position:0%
um so
 
05:59:06.840 --> 05:59:07.628 align:start position:0%
um so
it's

05:59:07.628 --> 05:59:07.638 align:start position:0%
it's
 
05:59:11.948 --> 05:59:11.958 align:start position:0%
situational right and uh the reminder
 
05:59:14.628 --> 05:59:14.638 align:start position:0%
that the that the law exists does help
 
05:59:16.468 --> 05:59:16.478 align:start position:0%
our offices when I say help our offices
 
05:59:21.110 --> 05:59:21.120 align:start position:0%
I also mean local taxpayers okay right
 
05:59:24.070 --> 05:59:24.080 align:start position:0%
representative bir goad without a hammer
 
05:59:28.310 --> 05:59:28.320 align:start position:0%
to to follow up this this gentle letter
 
05:59:31.708 --> 05:59:31.718 align:start position:0%
I assume it says to let's say a
 
05:59:34.910 --> 05:59:34.920 align:start position:0%
90-year-old person that if you don't
 
05:59:38.990 --> 05:59:39.000 align:start position:0%
help out including if you refuse to go
 
05:59:40.150 --> 05:59:40.160 align:start position:0%
back to
 
05:59:44.230 --> 05:59:44.240 align:start position:0%
work um you will be subject potentially
 
05:59:47.548 --> 05:59:47.558 align:start position:0%
to a mandatory jail term is that the
 
05:59:52.310 --> 05:59:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:55.868 --> 05:59:55.878 align:start position:0%
to based on the statute it could be done
 
05:59:58.830 --> 05:59:58.840 align:start position:0%
based on reality and I've been doing
 
06:00:01.310 --> 06:00:01.320 align:start position:0%
local welfare for 21 years it doesn't
 
06:00:02.510 --> 06:00:02.520 align:start position:0%
that does not
 
06:00:05.150 --> 06:00:05.160 align:start position:0%
happen all right other qu yes
 
06:00:08.990 --> 06:00:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:12.590 --> 06:00:12.600 align:start position:0%
when you first started you uh uh said
 
06:00:15.430 --> 06:00:15.440 align:start position:0%
which RSA you uh operate under could you
 
06:00:19.150 --> 06:00:19.160 align:start position:0%
uh tell us that one again yeah RSA
 
06:00:23.548 --> 06:00:23.558 align:start position:0%
165 and the uh relative liability is RSA
 
06:00:29.390 --> 06:00:29.400 align:start position:0%
165 colon 19 say again RSA 165 colon 19
 
06:00:31.830 --> 06:00:31.840 align:start position:0%
is the legally liable relative I thought
 
06:00:33.708 --> 06:00:33.718 align:start position:0%
that was a different one sorry all right
 
06:00:35.708 --> 06:00:35.718 align:start position:0%
any other questions for this witness
 
06:00:37.948 --> 06:00:37.958 align:start position:0%
well representative Manos thank you Mr
 
06:00:39.430 --> 06:00:39.440 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
06:00:41.750 --> 06:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
question it sounds to me from your
 
06:00:43.350 --> 06:00:43.360 align:start position:0%
testimony that there's sort of an
 
06:00:46.468 --> 06:00:46.478 align:start position:0%
informal process that goes on here and
 
06:00:48.948 --> 06:00:48.958 align:start position:0%
I'm curious about that so in this
 
06:00:50.910 --> 06:00:50.920 align:start position:0%
informal process let's say you have
 
06:00:53.350 --> 06:00:53.360 align:start position:0%
somebody who's homeless maybe with some
 
06:00:55.468 --> 06:00:55.478 align:start position:0%
mental illness problems or addiction
 
06:00:57.868 --> 06:00:57.878 align:start position:0%
problems and there's a question of
 
06:01:01.270 --> 06:01:01.280 align:start position:0%
domestic violence or not it sounds like
 
06:01:03.670 --> 06:01:03.680 align:start position:0%
it can be cyclical that the person can
 
06:01:06.150 --> 06:01:06.160 align:start position:0%
maybe stay put with the sister for for a
 
06:01:08.590 --> 06:01:08.600 align:start position:0%
while and then they leave again
 
06:01:12.310 --> 06:01:12.320 align:start position:0%
and it's who who makes that judge who's
 
06:01:15.310 --> 06:01:15.320 align:start position:0%
making those judgments it sounds like
 
06:01:19.750 --> 06:01:19.760 align:start position:0%
it's almost for lack of a better word
 
06:01:23.310 --> 06:01:23.320 align:start position:0%
handholding um and and I'm just curious
 
06:01:26.910 --> 06:01:26.920 align:start position:0%
about that so I just for some
 
06:01:30.030 --> 06:01:30.040 align:start position:0%
clarification if a so if a person who
 
06:01:32.948 --> 06:01:32.958 align:start position:0%
was unhoused or in in a challenging
 
06:01:36.390 --> 06:01:36.400 align:start position:0%
situation is bouncing or including
 
06:01:37.788 --> 06:01:37.798 align:start position:0%
staying with a
 
06:01:37.798 --> 06:01:40.430 align:start position:0%
staying with a
sister

06:01:40.430 --> 06:01:40.440 align:start position:0%
sister
 
06:01:43.468 --> 06:01:43.478 align:start position:0%
um how would we manage that I just want
 
06:01:45.750 --> 06:01:45.760 align:start position:0%
to make sure that's my question it seems
 
06:01:48.510 --> 06:01:48.520 align:start position:0%
like there's an ongoing informal process
 
06:01:51.350 --> 06:01:51.360 align:start position:0%
over time and people are exercising
 
06:01:54.110 --> 06:01:54.120 align:start position:0%
judgment and making judgments and
 
06:01:56.230 --> 06:01:56.240 align:start position:0%
Arrangement works for a while and then
 
06:01:59.788 --> 06:01:59.798 align:start position:0%
stops working and right yes that
 
06:02:02.910 --> 06:02:02.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely does happen where you know in
 
06:02:05.590 --> 06:02:05.600 align:start position:0%
our in our field we often call it cou
 
06:02:05.600 --> 06:02:08.750 align:start position:0%
our in our field we often call it cou
Sur

06:02:08.750 --> 06:02:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:11.030 --> 06:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
um um and that's what people call it who
 
06:02:13.468 --> 06:02:13.478 align:start position:0%
are who are who are unfortunately going
 
06:02:14.590 --> 06:02:14.600 align:start position:0%
through those
 
06:02:17.548 --> 06:02:17.558 align:start position:0%
situations um and you know if someone's
 
06:02:19.468 --> 06:02:19.478 align:start position:0%
staying with a sister in that situation
 
06:02:21.868 --> 06:02:21.878 align:start position:0%
where local welfare is not paying
 
06:02:25.190 --> 06:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
anything um and I will state to to
 
06:02:28.350 --> 06:02:28.360 align:start position:0%
further clarify I think it's if someone
 
06:02:31.750 --> 06:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
approaches our office and they're 18
 
06:02:35.110 --> 06:02:35.120 align:start position:0%
years old 19 years old stating oh my my
 
06:02:38.350 --> 06:02:38.360 align:start position:0%
mother just kicked me out right and and
 
06:02:41.868 --> 06:02:41.878 align:start position:0%
maybe that adult has a
 
06:02:44.670 --> 06:02:44.680 align:start position:0%
child um we will listen to the situation
 
06:02:46.070 --> 06:02:46.080 align:start position:0%
because we do certainly do not want to
 
06:02:49.830 --> 06:02:49.840 align:start position:0%
refer them back into a harmful situation
 
06:02:52.948 --> 06:02:52.958 align:start position:0%
even if it saves money right it's not
 
06:02:56.750 --> 06:02:56.760 align:start position:0%
okay um but if their story sounds like
 
06:02:58.628 --> 06:02:58.638 align:start position:0%
you know maybe we should make a phone
 
06:03:01.230 --> 06:03:01.240 align:start position:0%
call to that to that parent we may very
 
06:03:03.990 --> 06:03:04.000 align:start position:0%
well do that and we could cite the law
 
06:03:05.948 --> 06:03:05.958 align:start position:0%
normally we don't need to normally I can
 
06:03:07.750 --> 06:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
say Hey you know your daughter's here
 
06:03:11.590 --> 06:03:11.600 align:start position:0%
with your grand child um yeah is it okay
 
06:03:13.628 --> 06:03:13.638 align:start position:0%
if they come back oh
 
06:03:17.590 --> 06:03:17.600 align:start position:0%
absolutely right but we have that law in
 
06:03:20.150 --> 06:03:20.160 align:start position:0%
order to point to if we need to and what
 
06:03:24.468 --> 06:03:24.478 align:start position:0%
we do um yes judgments are made because
 
06:03:27.230 --> 06:03:27.240 align:start position:0%
we're constantly solution finding it
 
06:03:29.070 --> 06:03:29.080 align:start position:0%
it's what local welfare does is not
 
06:03:29.080 --> 06:03:30.390 align:start position:0%
it's what local welfare does is not
categorical

06:03:30.390 --> 06:03:30.400 align:start position:0%
categorical
 
06:03:33.468 --> 06:03:33.478 align:start position:0%
assistance um whereas in tanif uh
 
06:03:36.830 --> 06:03:36.840 align:start position:0%
Medicaid it's more these are the numbers
 
06:03:39.030 --> 06:03:39.040 align:start position:0%
in the in the in the the decisions are
 
06:03:41.628 --> 06:03:41.638 align:start position:0%
primarily noted by by the numbers in
 
06:03:43.390 --> 06:03:43.400 align:start position:0%
local welfare which is what I enjoy
 
06:03:45.628 --> 06:03:45.638 align:start position:0%
about it actually the numbers matter the
 
06:03:47.510 --> 06:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
numbers matter the budgets matter but
 
06:03:49.270 --> 06:03:49.280 align:start position:0%
we're going to ask the question what's
 
06:03:52.628 --> 06:03:52.638 align:start position:0%
going on what's your situation because
 
06:03:55.310 --> 06:03:55.320 align:start position:0%
that matters too it helps us to problem
 
06:03:58.510 --> 06:03:58.520 align:start position:0%
solve right so it it that's how our
 
06:04:00.350 --> 06:04:00.360 align:start position:0%
system local welfare Works
 
06:04:02.990 --> 06:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
representative Mort yes thank you um and
 
06:04:04.430 --> 06:04:04.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question you're
 
06:04:07.830 --> 06:04:07.840 align:start position:0%
welcome so Harbor care is is that
 
06:04:09.830 --> 06:04:09.840 align:start position:0%
another resource rather than put aing it
 
06:04:12.548 --> 06:04:12.558 align:start position:0%
back on the towns or or United Way or I
 
06:04:14.350 --> 06:04:14.360 align:start position:0%
mean are there other resources or is
 
06:04:16.468 --> 06:04:16.478 align:start position:0%
this either you know your your brother
 
06:04:17.948 --> 06:04:17.958 align:start position:0%
helps you or you know the town's going
 
06:04:19.190 --> 06:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
to have to pay for it and we're going to
 
06:04:23.468 --> 06:04:23.478 align:start position:0%
go after you um so if we can reasonably
 
06:04:26.788 --> 06:04:26.798 align:start position:0%
refer elsewhere we will if timing and
 
06:04:28.310 --> 06:04:28.320 align:start position:0%
and the nature of the
 
06:04:33.548 --> 06:04:33.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:36.150 --> 06:04:36.160 align:start position:0%
uh makes it okay to do so
 
06:04:38.150 --> 06:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
we we will but we we need to determine
 
06:04:40.270 --> 06:04:40.280 align:start position:0%
You Know What's the timing is there
 
06:04:42.310 --> 06:04:42.320 align:start position:0%
truly a resource that's available at
 
06:04:43.910 --> 06:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
4:00 on a
 
06:04:46.830 --> 06:04:46.840 align:start position:0%
Friday um and and we are the ones with a
 
06:04:49.310 --> 06:04:49.320 align:start position:0%
legal obligation you know United Way and
 
06:04:52.510 --> 06:04:52.520 align:start position:0%
some others not necessar they're not um
 
06:04:56.628 --> 06:04:56.638 align:start position:0%
but we will we will uh refer when it's
 
06:04:58.350 --> 06:04:58.360 align:start position:0%
reasonably possible to do so we
 
06:05:00.468 --> 06:05:00.478 align:start position:0%
collaborate with many helping providers
 
06:05:02.830 --> 06:05:02.840 align:start position:0%
and sometimes it's a puzzle of
 
06:05:05.190 --> 06:05:05.200 align:start position:0%
assistance when we can do that sometimes
 
06:05:08.708 --> 06:05:08.718 align:start position:0%
it takes time to do um but if we can
 
06:05:11.030 --> 06:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
refer we will um but when it comes down
 
06:05:13.150 --> 06:05:13.160 align:start position:0%
to it literally I try not to use that
 
06:05:16.110 --> 06:05:16.120 align:start position:0%
word too often but the buik
 
06:05:18.830 --> 06:05:18.840 align:start position:0%
stops all right all right thank you any
 
06:05:20.468 --> 06:05:20.478 align:start position:0%
any other question representative
 
06:05:22.788 --> 06:05:22.798 align:start position:0%
kop thank you chairman and thank you for
 
06:05:24.628 --> 06:05:24.638 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I just have a
 
06:05:26.110 --> 06:05:26.120 align:start position:0%
question so I'm not sure if you're
 
06:05:28.110 --> 06:05:28.120 align:start position:0%
familiar with the JIS V Emerson case
 
06:05:30.708 --> 06:05:30.718 align:start position:0%
from 1844 which is I think we're
 
06:05:32.948 --> 06:05:32.958 align:start position:0%
absolutely not
 
06:05:35.390 --> 06:05:35.400 align:start position:0%
okay so I think that that was it's a New
 
06:05:36.990 --> 06:05:37.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court case which
 
06:05:38.990 --> 06:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
basically said that the that the
 
06:05:40.948 --> 06:05:40.958 align:start position:0%
families would you believe that it's a
 
06:05:42.390 --> 06:05:42.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Supreme Court case that
 
06:05:44.430 --> 06:05:44.440 align:start position:0%
basically said that a family member is
 
06:05:47.310 --> 06:05:47.320 align:start position:0%
responsible and including a CH uh a
 
06:05:50.110 --> 06:05:50.120 align:start position:0%
child of a parent is responsible to take
 
06:05:52.190 --> 06:05:52.200 align:start position:0%
care of their their parent it was a it
 
06:05:56.150 --> 06:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
was a case that the child didn't want to
 
06:05:58.868 --> 06:05:58.878 align:start position:0%
pay for the the parents welfare um and I
 
06:06:00.830 --> 06:06:00.840 align:start position:0%
was told back in
 
06:06:03.270 --> 06:06:03.280 align:start position:0%
2023 that that's where this law came
 
06:06:04.990 --> 06:06:05.000 align:start position:0%
from and that even if we repealed it
 
06:06:06.868 --> 06:06:06.878 align:start position:0%
that common law basically said we had to
 
06:06:09.110 --> 06:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
do it anyway so do you still believe
 
06:06:10.590 --> 06:06:10.600 align:start position:0%
that that would be the case that common
 
06:06:12.468 --> 06:06:12.478 align:start position:0%
law would kind of make us do this anyway
 
06:06:14.270 --> 06:06:14.280 align:start position:0%
even if we repealed this well not being
 
06:06:15.910 --> 06:06:15.920 align:start position:0%
an attorney I need to I need to be
 
06:06:18.430 --> 06:06:18.440 align:start position:0%
careful with it with the answer to that
 
06:06:21.390 --> 06:06:21.400 align:start position:0%
um I will say this um in a situation
 
06:06:23.830 --> 06:06:23.840 align:start position:0%
that I mentioned earlier adult son comes
 
06:06:25.788 --> 06:06:25.798 align:start position:0%
in could be a daughter regarding the
 
06:06:31.030 --> 06:06:31.040 align:start position:0%
passing of his mother right um and the
 
06:06:32.628 --> 06:06:32.638 align:start position:0%
question is on our application regarding
 
06:06:34.788 --> 06:06:34.798 align:start position:0%
legally liable relatives it's on every
 
06:06:38.468 --> 06:06:38.478 align:start position:0%
application throughout State okay um one
 
06:06:40.628 --> 06:06:40.638 align:start position:0%
way I may phrase it I may say something
 
06:06:43.110 --> 06:06:43.120 align:start position:0%
like you know the way new the state of
 
06:06:45.110 --> 06:06:45.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire looks at this is family
 
06:06:47.110 --> 06:06:47.120 align:start position:0%
first if
 
06:06:50.948 --> 06:06:50.958 align:start position:0%
possible if possible and if they can't
 
06:06:53.830 --> 06:06:53.840 align:start position:0%
that's why we exist and so we we put it
 
06:06:56.948 --> 06:06:56.958 align:start position:0%
out there um and the person decides all
 
06:06:59.750 --> 06:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
right can I reasonably do this myself
 
06:07:02.430 --> 06:07:02.440 align:start position:0%
there are family members that simply who
 
06:07:04.430 --> 06:07:04.440 align:start position:0%

06:08:26.030 --> 06:08:26.040 align:start position:0%
we we don't see that there's a huge cost
 
06:08:29.230 --> 06:08:29.240 align:start position:0%
shift um if this if this bill passed
 
06:08:31.430 --> 06:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
however we do agree with the local
 
06:08:34.390 --> 06:08:34.400 align:start position:0%
Welfare Association that allowing it to
 
06:08:37.830 --> 06:08:37.840 align:start position:0%
still be in place does assist um with
 
06:08:41.230 --> 06:08:41.240 align:start position:0%
some uh welfare officers in um ensuring
 
06:08:43.628 --> 06:08:43.638 align:start position:0%
that some of the applicants are able
 
06:08:45.430 --> 06:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
some of the applicants get assistance
 
06:08:47.708 --> 06:08:47.718 align:start position:0%
from their family members at the the
 
06:08:49.510 --> 06:08:49.520 align:start position:0%
