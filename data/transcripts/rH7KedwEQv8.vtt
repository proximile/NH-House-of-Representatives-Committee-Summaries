so for the committee I started my
 
00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 align:start position:0%
morning down in our room looked a little
 
00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 align:start position:0%
dis shuttled down there and uh but I I
 
00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 align:start position:0%
sat up there not knowing that we weren't
 
00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 align:start position:0%
meeting there and when I came back into
 
00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 align:start position:0%

coming here and he told me that's where
 
00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 align:start position:0%
we're meeting today so so otherwise I
 
00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 align:start position:0%

Senate District 14 comprising the towns
 
00:07:31.029 --> 00:07:31.039 align:start position:0%
of Hudson London da and Auburn and I
 
00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:33.240 align:start position:0%
have for your consideration uh Senate
 
00:07:36.469 --> 00:07:36.479 align:start position:0%
Bill 468 which seeks to designate a
 
00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:39.120 align:start position:0%
portion of Route 111 in Hudson as the
 
00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
Senator Robert EC Jr Memorial Highway um
 
00:07:46.589 --> 00:07:46.599 align:start position:0%
many people um knew Bob CLE served with
 
00:07:48.589 --> 00:07:48.599 align:start position:0%
Bob CLE he was a member of the House for
 
00:07:50.629 --> 00:07:50.639 align:start position:0%
a number of terms he served in the
 
00:07:53.469 --> 00:07:53.479 align:start position:0%
Senate as well uh where he served as the
 
00:07:57.589 --> 00:07:57.599 align:start position:0%
majority leader and um he didn't quite
 
00:07:59.550 --> 00:07:59.560 align:start position:0%
get enough of politics he ran for
 
00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
Congress and did not win and he came
 
00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:04.960 align:start position:0%
back as a lobbyist and uh that's why I
 
00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:07.240 align:start position:0%
think many people know who he is because
 
00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:10.720 align:start position:0%
he was always talking with people um
 
00:08:14.869 --> 00:08:14.879 align:start position:0%
unfort he unfortunately he passed away
 
00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:18.360 align:start position:0%
very suddenly last year in August it
 
00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:20.680 align:start position:0%
devastated his family and his friends
 
00:08:23.749 --> 00:08:23.759 align:start position:0%
and everyone who knew him um I had the
 
00:08:26.589 --> 00:08:26.599 align:start position:0%
pleasure of meeting Bob back in the
 
00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:29.840 align:start position:0%
1990s my husband was a member of the new
 
00:08:33.149 --> 00:08:33.159 align:start position:0%
house and I met him at political events
 
00:08:36.709 --> 00:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
and I was elected in 2000 to the house
 
00:08:38.709 --> 00:08:38.719 align:start position:0%
and my husband told me there's one
 
00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
person you need to talk to and that's
 
00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:43.800 align:start position:0%
Bob CLE and that's exactly what I did
 
00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:46.680 align:start position:0%
and Bob became a good friend and a
 
00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:51.680 align:start position:0%
mentor to me um for many many years um
 
00:08:53.389 --> 00:08:53.399 align:start position:0%
he if I ever I had a question about
 
00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:55.560 align:start position:0%
anything I could pick up the phone call
 
00:08:58.350 --> 00:08:58.360 align:start position:0%
him and ask him and he always had an
 
00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:00.720 align:start position:0%
answer he always had had an ADI uh any
 
00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:03.680 align:start position:0%
kind of advice he was tuned in to the
 
00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:06.600 align:start position:0%
legislature as I said he knew just about
 
00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:11.519 align:start position:0%
everybody um he was he's just had Public
 
00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:14.440 align:start position:0%
Service in his blood he was active in
 
00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
his community as well when he passed he
 
00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:20.200 align:start position:0%
was sitting on the town budget committee
 
00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:22.040 align:start position:0%
um sometimes you might not have liked
 
00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
what he had to say but he was always
 
00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
honest he was always upfront with you
 
00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:28.720 align:start position:0%
and if you had a question and he didn't
 
00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:30.920 align:start position:0%
know the answer he'd say I let me find
 
00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
out and I'll get back to you and he
 
00:09:35.069 --> 00:09:35.079 align:start position:0%
would do that
 
00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:38.320 align:start position:0%
um in thinking about Bob and everything
 
00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:42.200 align:start position:0%
that he had done especially for me I was
 
00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
thinking what's a good way to honor him
 
00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:47.320 align:start position:0%
and that's when I thought about the a
 
00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:50.760 align:start position:0%
portion of 111 I spoke to his family and
 
00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:53.680 align:start position:0%
they are in complete support of us doing
 
00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
this so um Unfortunately they couldn't
 
00:09:58.949 --> 00:09:58.959 align:start position:0%
be here as well as a lot of Bob's
 
00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:01.200 align:start position:0%
friends because they still find it very
 
00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
very difficult to discuss his
 
00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.550 align:start position:0%
very difficult to discuss his
passing

00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:05.560 align:start position:0%
passing
 
00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:08.920 align:start position:0%
um so that's what you have in front of
 
00:10:12.069 --> 00:10:12.079 align:start position:0%
you is just my my take on the whole
 
00:10:14.269 --> 00:10:14.279 align:start position:0%
thing let's get a portion of 111 that
 
00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
runs through the town of Hudson uh named
 
00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
in his honor
 
00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:22.160 align:start position:0%
um there is a cost as you know
 
00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:25.240 align:start position:0%
Associated that with this and the last
 
00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:27.880 align:start position:0%
time I had asked for a designation
 
00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:29.720 align:start position:0%
usually the town will come out once they
 
00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:32.480 align:start position:0%
choose a spot they will dig the hole but
 
00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
I um I will be responsible for the pole
 
00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
and the sign um that's how strongly I
 
00:10:41.509 --> 00:10:41.519 align:start position:0%
feel about this but I'll I'll just leave
 
00:10:45.509 --> 00:10:45.519 align:start position:0%
you with um a story um I talked with Bob
 
00:10:49.269 --> 00:10:49.279 align:start position:0%
shortly before he became ill and he had
 
00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:51.440 align:start position:0%
just become a new grandfather his
 
00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:53.800 align:start position:0%
granddaughter was approaching her first
 
00:10:57.430 --> 00:10:57.440 align:start position:0%
birthday and he talked extensively about
 
00:10:59.550 --> 00:10:59.560 align:start position:0%
all the things he wanted to do with his
 
00:11:02.629 --> 00:11:02.639 align:start position:0%
granddaughter and unfortunately he will
 
00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:05.720 align:start position:0%
not be able to do these and I thought in
 
00:11:09.269 --> 00:11:09.279 align:start position:0%
my opinion every time his uh family her
 
00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:11.360 align:start position:0%
family goes through the town she can
 
00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:14.120 align:start position:0%
point at that sign and say that's my pop
 
00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:17.240 align:start position:0%
pop and I I just think that's such a
 
00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
wonderful thing that we can do to honor
 
00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:24.440 align:start position:0%
Bob um he Bob was a humble person we
 
00:11:26.829 --> 00:11:26.839 align:start position:0%
found out after he died all the things
 
00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
that he did to help people AC not not
 
00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
even in his district but around the
 
00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:35.160 align:start position:0%
state he supported
 
00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:38.440 align:start position:0%
veterans um you named the cause he was
 
00:11:41.829 --> 00:11:41.839 align:start position:0%
there and he if people were struggling
 
00:11:43.829 --> 00:11:43.839 align:start position:0%
and they needed help whether it is
 
00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:47.120 align:start position:0%
financially he would give them money I
 
00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:49.160 align:start position:0%
most of us had no idea he was doing
 
00:11:52.069 --> 00:11:52.079 align:start position:0%
these things and he did it quietly he
 
00:11:55.069 --> 00:11:55.079 align:start position:0%
didn't want accolades he didn't want you
 
00:11:57.590 --> 00:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
know people yeah had a boy Bob he just
 
00:11:59.269 --> 00:11:59.279 align:start position:0%
did the things that needed to be done in
 
00:12:02.269 --> 00:12:02.279 align:start position:0%
he did him quietly um unfortunately we
 
00:12:04.389 --> 00:12:04.399 align:start position:0%
can't do this sign quietly it has to be
 
00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:07.000 align:start position:0%

private school in the town of Hudson and

00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:28.120 align:start position:0%
between our two respective roads um his
 
00:15:31.189 --> 00:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
property was over the Hill from mine and
 
00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:33.720 align:start position:0%
he had a beautiful beautiful garden he
 
00:15:36.269 --> 00:15:36.279 align:start position:0%
would often marry couples in that Garden
 
00:15:40.309 --> 00:15:40.319 align:start position:0%
as a justice of the peace and I one
 
00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:42.120 align:start position:0%
story I'll just relate that he shared
 
00:15:44.509 --> 00:15:44.519 align:start position:0%
with me one time he used to see an older
 
00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:47.680 align:start position:0%
couple just sitting in their car kind of
 
00:15:51.829 --> 00:15:51.839 align:start position:0%
munching on sandwiches and finally got
 
00:15:53.749 --> 00:15:53.759 align:start position:0%
you know was curious so he went and he
 
00:15:57.470 --> 00:15:57.480 align:start position:0%
went out to what are why are you guys oh
 
00:15:59.590 --> 00:15:59.600 align:start position:0%

I I believe even years he's he's he
 
00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:23.880 align:start position:0%
would see them come around occasionally
 
00:16:26.309 --> 00:16:26.319 align:start position:0%
go there and and occasionally after she
 
00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:28.360 align:start position:0%
passed he would see the man come there
 
00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:32.120 align:start position:0%
and and memory of her so and that was
 
00:16:33.829 --> 00:16:33.839 align:start position:0%
just the kind of guy he was he was
 
00:16:36.629 --> 00:16:36.639 align:start position:0%

certainly want to amplify the comments
 
00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:36.320 align:start position:0%
that have been presented by Senator
 
00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:38.120 align:start position:0%
Kason and my good colleague and
 
00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:40.640 align:start position:0%
gentleman from Hudson representative ly
 
00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
um regarding Bob CLE the only thing I
 
00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:46.120 align:start position:0%
would add to it is Bob kle was one of
 
00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
the first people I met when I moved to
 
00:22:50.029 --> 00:22:50.039 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and kind of laid the
 
00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:52.240 align:start position:0%
landscape of everything that there was
 
00:22:54.549 --> 00:22:54.559 align:start position:0%
regarding Civics and politics and
 
00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
government here in the state of New
 
00:22:59.390 --> 00:22:59.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and um I am very GR grateful
 
00:23:03.029 --> 00:23:03.039 align:start position:0%
personally to his for his friendship and
 
00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:05.400 align:start position:0%
for his mentorship and I think
 
00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
dedicating a stretch of 111 is
 
00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:10.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely apropo to honor the legacy of
 
00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:13.080 align:start position:0%
Bob kle because like in meramac with our
 
00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
former speaker dick hinch that sign us
 
00:23:19.149 --> 00:23:19.159 align:start position:0%
there so that his grandson can see see
 
00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
his name up on the highway and I think
 
00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:23.080 align:start position:0%
it's befitting that that uh his
 
00:23:25.669 --> 00:23:25.679 align:start position:0%
granddaughter be able to have the same
 
00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
level of joy that Charlie Hench is going
 
00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:30.520 align:start position:0%
to be experiencing so um that's what I'd
 
00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:32.320 align:start position:0%
like to say to amplify the bill and I
 
00:23:34.269 --> 00:23:34.279 align:start position:0%

00:23:42.669 --> 00:23:42.679 align:start position:0%
think when I first came to the to the
 
00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
legislature at the time I believe he was
 
00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:47.080 align:start position:0%
a fellow rep he also later became a
 
00:23:49.549 --> 00:23:49.559 align:start position:0%
senator we didn't always see eye to eye
 
00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
on every issue but I got along with him
 
00:23:54.789 --> 00:23:54.799 align:start position:0%
personally and a few years ago he gave
 
00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:57.240 align:start position:0%
me in an email I believe one of the best
 
00:23:58.669 --> 00:23:58.679 align:start position:0%
compliments he said you're one of the
 
00:24:00.909 --> 00:24:00.919 align:start position:0%

our committee tables Works everything is
 
00:35:24.510 --> 00:35:24.520 align:start position:0%
scattered throughout this building so we
 
00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
sit here without a gavel and we sit not
 
00:35:30.750 --> 00:35:30.760 align:start position:0%
in our room so uh mostly to my committee
 
00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:34.240 align:start position:0%
members we also uh own the largest gavel
 
00:35:36.190 --> 00:35:36.200 align:start position:0%
in the house other than the senator or
 
00:35:37.870 --> 00:35:37.880 align:start position:0%
excuse me than the speaker of the house
 
00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
so we're trying to run that down today
 
00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
because it hasn't been seen for a couple
 
00:35:45.190 --> 00:35:45.200 align:start position:0%
weeks so I hate to take away from your
 
00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:48.240 align:start position:0%

00:35:50.510 --> 00:35:50.520 align:start position:0%

you all um this bill is at the request
 
02:05:12.870 --> 02:05:12.880 align:start position:0%
of the department and it puts into
 
02:05:15.510 --> 02:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
statute a program that had been underway
 
02:05:17.549 --> 02:05:17.559 align:start position:0%
for quite some time in which there is a
 
02:05:20.950 --> 02:05:20.960 align:start position:0%
compact between Dot and municipalities
 
02:05:24.430 --> 02:05:24.440 align:start position:0%

Municipal uh vehicles and uh we've been
 
02:05:32.990 --> 02:05:33.000 align:start position:0%

02:05:36.069 --> 02:05:36.079 align:start position:0%
gee it ought to be in statute and it
 
02:05:38.069 --> 02:05:38.079 align:start position:0%

to see this amendment um existing
 
02:05:43.229 --> 02:05:43.239 align:start position:0%

with the municipal plates I do think dot
 
02:06:13.430 --> 02:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
can explain what the universe of that is
 
02:06:15.709 --> 02:06:15.719 align:start position:0%

02:06:30.030 --> 02:06:30.040 align:start position:0%
been going on without
 
02:06:32.870 --> 02:06:32.880 align:start position:0%

military what the change in this bill is
 
02:07:41.549 --> 02:07:41.559 align:start position:0%
um there has been a change with
 
02:07:43.589 --> 02:07:43.599 align:start position:0%
municipalities that they're getting um
 
02:07:45.990 --> 02:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
passenger plates now instead of mpal
 
02:07:50.310 --> 02:07:50.320 align:start position:0%
plates and to continue with the law we
 
02:07:53.910 --> 02:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
decided we recommend a change to say any
 
02:07:56.629 --> 02:07:56.639 align:start position:0%
missal register Vehicles get the free
 
02:07:58.629 --> 02:07:58.639 align:start position:0%
toll and a lot of it's dealing with the
 
02:08:00.950 --> 02:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
transponders that Senator Waters talked
 
02:08:04.750 --> 02:08:04.760 align:start position:0%
about um any any one of these state
 
02:08:07.629 --> 02:08:07.639 align:start position:0%
agencies municipalities they come to us
 
02:08:10.870 --> 02:08:10.880 align:start position:0%
we um sell them the non-rev transp
 
02:08:13.629 --> 02:08:13.639 align:start position:0%
transponders but in the past they had a
 
02:08:15.709 --> 02:08:15.719 align:start position:0%
municipal plate but now there's been a
 
02:08:18.270 --> 02:08:18.280 align:start position:0%
change these passenger plates so now
 
02:08:20.350 --> 02:08:20.360 align:start position:0%
they give us proof of the registration
 
02:08:22.549 --> 02:08:22.559 align:start position:0%
as municipality and then we sell them
 
02:08:22.559 --> 02:08:23.549 align:start position:0%
as municipality and then we sell them
the

02:08:23.549 --> 02:08:23.559 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:08:26.030 --> 02:08:26.040 align:start position:0%

pner

02:08:44.790 --> 02:08:44.800 align:start position:0%
pner
 
02:08:48.629 --> 02:08:48.639 align:start position:0%
so the tollfree is only available on a
 
02:08:51.549 --> 02:08:51.559 align:start position:0%
vehicle that has Municipal plates so if
 
02:08:54.310 --> 02:08:54.320 align:start position:0%
the municipality obtains a
 
02:08:56.750 --> 02:08:56.760 align:start position:0%
transponder they're obliged to use it
 
02:08:58.870 --> 02:08:58.880 align:start position:0%
only on a particular vehicle or only on
 
02:09:00.790 --> 02:09:00.800 align:start position:0%
a one of the vehicles that has Municipal
 
02:09:03.350 --> 02:09:03.360 align:start position:0%
plates is there a way to
 
02:09:06.030 --> 02:09:06.040 align:start position:0%
enforce they're not using it for private
 
02:09:09.030 --> 02:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
uh travel by by employees for
 
02:09:11.990 --> 02:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
example um we can't enforce that but
 
02:09:14.750 --> 02:09:14.760 align:start position:0%
there has been like we have an agreement
 
02:09:17.790 --> 02:09:17.800 align:start position:0%
with the vipal and it says it's only for
 
02:09:21.549 --> 02:09:21.559 align:start position:0%
municipality um um Vehicles you can't
 
02:09:23.589 --> 02:09:23.599 align:start position:0%
use it outside of New Hampshire you know
 
02:09:27.069 --> 02:09:27.079 align:start position:0%
if you went to mass um we've had not a
 
02:09:29.870 --> 02:09:29.880 align:start position:0%
mpal but some people who' buy these from
 
02:09:31.709 --> 02:09:31.719 align:start position:0%
us we get information when they're
 
02:09:33.549 --> 02:09:33.559 align:start position:0%
questioning if their employees are using
 
02:09:36.270 --> 02:09:36.280 align:start position:0%
it outside and we pass it on to them but
 
02:09:38.390 --> 02:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
that's up to them and their rules of how
 
02:09:40.229 --> 02:09:40.239 align:start position:0%
they handle
 
02:09:42.629 --> 02:09:42.639 align:start position:0%
that any further questions for the
 
02:09:45.910 --> 02:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
Department yes please thank you Mr
 
02:09:47.109 --> 02:09:47.119 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
02:09:49.589 --> 02:09:49.599 align:start position:0%
question you have an idea of how many
 
02:09:52.950 --> 02:09:52.960 align:start position:0%
vehicles we're talking about
 
02:09:57.109 --> 02:09:57.119 align:start position:0%
um if we allow this um I'm not sure how
 
02:09:59.790 --> 02:09:59.800 align:start position:0%
many every municipality has different um
 
02:10:02.149 --> 02:10:02.159 align:start position:0%
number of vehicles but this has been in
 
02:10:04.109 --> 02:10:04.119 align:start position:0%
law for years like there's no Revenue
 
02:10:06.669 --> 02:10:06.679 align:start position:0%
impact to us it was always going by
 
02:10:10.430 --> 02:10:10.440 align:start position:0%
their plates missable plates um but
 
02:10:14.069 --> 02:10:14.079 align:start position:0%
their plate some reason within DMV now
 
02:10:15.750 --> 02:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
when they registered Vehicles it's a
 
02:10:18.549 --> 02:10:18.559 align:start position:0%
passenger plate like our like a typical
 
02:10:21.310 --> 02:10:21.320 align:start position:0%
plate that like I have on my vehicle and
 
02:10:23.390 --> 02:10:23.400 align:start position:0%
and this law is just changing it to
 
02:10:25.229 --> 02:10:25.239 align:start position:0%
allow those because they're registered
 
02:10:28.149 --> 02:10:28.159 align:start position:0%
to the town um they show us proof of
 
02:10:30.069 --> 02:10:30.079 align:start position:0%
insurance proof of registration at it's
 
02:10:31.629 --> 02:10:31.639 align:start position:0%
a municipal
 
02:10:33.589 --> 02:10:33.599 align:start position:0%
vehicle thank
 
02:10:36.069 --> 02:10:36.079 align:start position:0%
you thank you any further questions for
 
02:10:38.069 --> 02:10:38.079 align:start position:0%
the Department yes represent chairman I
 
02:10:40.910 --> 02:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
just want to be clear here although they
 
02:10:42.549 --> 02:10:42.559 align:start position:0%
can with the transponders go through the
 
02:10:44.270 --> 02:10:44.280 align:start position:0%
tolls for free I believe there's a fee
 
02:10:46.189 --> 02:10:46.199 align:start position:0%
for the transponders which they have to
 
02:10:50.229 --> 02:10:50.239 align:start position:0%
pay yes yes correct current fee it's um
 
02:10:53.589 --> 02:10:53.599 align:start position:0%
around $6 right now $6 right now okay as
 
02:10:55.109 --> 02:10:55.119 align:start position:0%
of today and is it is it probably you
 
02:10:57.069 --> 02:10:57.079 align:start position:0%
anticipate rais in the next few years or
 
02:10:59.589 --> 02:10:59.599 align:start position:0%
when was it last raise um usually

FN authorizing the sale of toll credits
 
02:34:58.790 --> 02:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
to fund a newly established noise
 
02:35:01.630 --> 02:35:01.640 align:start position:0%
barrier construction fund for the design
 
02:35:04.349 --> 02:35:04.359 align:start position:0%
and construction of noise barrier
 
02:35:07.990 --> 02:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
projects and I uh before I welcome the
 
02:35:10.790 --> 02:35:10.800 align:start position:0%

you close I had help uh and uh please uh
 
02:35:31.349 --> 02:35:31.359 align:start position:0%
please present your legislation thank
 
02:35:33.190 --> 02:35:33.200 align:start position:0%
you good afternoon chairman and members
 
02:35:35.150 --> 02:35:35.160 align:start position:0%
of the House Public Works and highways
 
02:35:37.710 --> 02:35:37.720 align:start position:0%
committee I'm Denise rardy I'm the state
 
02:35:41.030 --> 02:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
senator for District 9 representing 13
 
02:35:43.030 --> 02:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
beautiful towns from Bedford all the way
 
02:35:43.040 --> 02:35:43.710 align:start position:0%
beautiful towns from Bedford all the way
to

02:35:43.710 --> 02:35:43.720 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:35:47.309 --> 02:35:47.319 align:start position:0%
Hinsdale um before I actually read my my
 
02:35:48.630 --> 02:35:48.640 align:start position:0%
introduction to you I want to give a
 
02:35:50.950 --> 02:35:50.960 align:start position:0%
little bit of a background around so
 
02:35:53.070 --> 02:35:53.080 align:start position:0%
what prompted this legislation to begin
 
02:35:56.150 --> 02:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
with is that I have a neighborhood um in
 
02:35:59.150 --> 02:35:59.160 align:start position:0%
my district in Bedford tberry Lane and
 
02:36:02.349 --> 02:36:02.359 align:start position:0%
they were there long before you know we
 
02:36:03.630 --> 02:36:03.640 align:start position:0%
had the highway and then the highway
 
02:36:05.950 --> 02:36:05.960 align:start position:0%
kept growing and growing and I'm telling
 
02:36:08.269 --> 02:36:08.279 align:start position:0%
you if you go to their houses and you
 
02:36:10.469 --> 02:36:10.479 align:start position:0%
stand in their driveway you can't even
 
02:36:13.269 --> 02:36:13.279 align:start position:0%
hear yourself think when we've met I
 
02:36:14.990 --> 02:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
have to make arrangements for us to go
 
02:36:17.030 --> 02:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
to the Bedford police station and meet
 
02:36:19.750 --> 02:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
in the conference room or the town hall
 
02:36:21.950 --> 02:36:21.960 align:start position:0%
it is horrible that they have to live
 
02:36:26.550 --> 02:36:26.560 align:start position:0%
like this and the problem with um them
 
02:36:29.190 --> 02:36:29.200 align:start position:0%
not being allowed a noise barrier is the
 
02:36:33.190 --> 02:36:33.200 align:start position:0%
criteria in our policies which say that
 
02:36:36.190 --> 02:36:36.200 align:start position:0%
although the decibel is within the
 
02:36:38.670 --> 02:36:38.680 align:start position:0%
allowable amount for noise barrier the
 
02:36:41.830 --> 02:36:41.840 align:start position:0%
density is not so for example if that
 
02:36:43.910 --> 02:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
was an apartment building instead of
 
02:36:45.429 --> 02:36:45.439 align:start position:0%
people's homes that they've lived there
 
02:36:47.950 --> 02:36:47.960 align:start position:0%
for 60 years they would be able to get
 
02:36:51.230 --> 02:36:51.240 align:start position:0%
the noise barrier and it's been an
 
02:36:54.150 --> 02:36:54.160 align:start position:0%
ongoing problem long before I was even
 
02:36:57.110 --> 02:36:57.120 align:start position:0%
in the Senate here and trying to find a
 
02:37:00.670 --> 02:37:00.680 align:start position:0%
proper solution has not been easy so now
 
02:37:03.349 --> 02:37:03.359 align:start position:0%
I'll read my testimony to you because
 
02:37:04.870 --> 02:37:04.880 align:start position:0%
there is a solution here that I hope
 
02:37:06.389 --> 02:37:06.399 align:start position:0%
you'll be able to
 
02:37:09.590 --> 02:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
support um Senate Bill 580 presents a
 
02:37:11.830 --> 02:37:11.840 align:start position:0%
proactive solution to address noise
 
02:37:14.910 --> 02:37:14.920 align:start position:0%
pollution concerns across our state by
 
02:37:17.110 --> 02:37:17.120 align:start position:0%
creating the noise barrier construction
 
02:37:19.670 --> 02:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
fund the fund will provide vital
 
02:37:21.670 --> 02:37:21.680 align:start position:0%
resources for completion of noise
 
02:37:24.269 --> 02:37:24.279 align:start position:0%
barrier construction projects that meet
 
02:37:27.269 --> 02:37:27.279 align:start position:0%
type two noise barrier criteria as
 
02:37:29.030 --> 02:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
determined by the Department of
 
02:37:31.190 --> 02:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
Transportation one of the key provisions
 
02:37:33.910 --> 02:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
of Senate Bill 580 is the authorization
 
02:37:35.309 --> 02:37:35.319 align:start position:0%
for the commissioner of the Department
 
02:37:37.750 --> 02:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
of Transportation to sell up to 10
 
02:37:40.469 --> 02:37:40.479 align:start position:0%
million in toll credits annually
 
02:37:42.230 --> 02:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
provided there are sufficient credits
 
02:37:45.389 --> 02:37:45.399 align:start position:0%
available for the state to match Federal
 
02:37:48.030 --> 02:37:48.040 align:start position:0%
uh uh portion and upon a proper approval
 
02:37:50.550 --> 02:37:50.560 align:start position:0%
and compliance with all regul ations
 
02:37:52.550 --> 02:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
this Innovative approach will generate
 
02:37:54.630 --> 02:37:54.640 align:start position:0%
much needed funding for noise barrier
 
02:37:56.990 --> 02:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
construction projects without imposing
 
02:37:59.230 --> 02:37:59.240 align:start position:0%
an additional financial burden on our
 
02:38:01.510 --> 02:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
taxpayers by establishing the noise
 
02:38:03.910 --> 02:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
barrier construction fund and leveraging
 
02:38:06.670 --> 02:38:06.680 align:start position:0%
toll credits this bill will empower the
 
02:38:09.190 --> 02:38:09.200 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation to properly
 
02:38:11.349 --> 02:38:11.359 align:start position:0%
address noise pollution effectively and
 
02:38:14.110 --> 02:38:14.120 align:start position:0%
efficiently moreover this amendment will
 
02:38:16.429 --> 02:38:16.439 align:start position:0%
provide municipalities throughout the
 
02:38:18.710 --> 02:38:18.720 align:start position:0%
state with an opportunity to receive
 
02:38:21.190 --> 02:38:21.200 align:start position:0%
noise barriers construction when needed
 
02:38:23.990 --> 02:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
enhancing the quality of life for
 
02:38:26.510 --> 02:38:26.520 align:start position:0%
residents in the affected areas in
 
02:38:29.550 --> 02:38:29.560 align:start position:0%
conclusion Senate Bill 580 represents a
 
02:38:31.830 --> 02:38:31.840 align:start position:0%
proactive and fiscally responsible
 
02:38:34.269 --> 02:38:34.279 align:start position:0%
approach to mitigating noise pollution
 
02:38:36.110 --> 02:38:36.120 align:start position:0%
and improving the well-being of our
 
02:38:38.429 --> 02:38:38.439 align:start position:0%
communities I urge the members of this
 
02:38:40.550 --> 02:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
committee to support this bill and
 
02:38:43.030 --> 02:38:43.040 align:start position:0%
ensure its passage for the benefit of
 
02:38:45.469 --> 02:38:45.479 align:start position:0%
our state I thank you for your attention
 
02:38:48.790 --> 02:38:48.800 align:start position:0%
in this matter again this is for me
 
02:38:50.550 --> 02:38:50.560 align:start position:0%
quality of life life your home is your
 
02:38:53.150 --> 02:38:53.160 align:start position:0%
Castle you have a right to live there in
 
02:38:54.750 --> 02:38:54.760 align:start position:0%
peace and enjoy your home and your
 
02:38:56.830 --> 02:38:56.840 align:start position:0%
families and we haven't been able to
 
02:39:01.309 --> 02:39:01.319 align:start position:0%
find a solution that works cost-wise and
 
02:39:04.070 --> 02:39:04.080 align:start position:0%
there are many of other towns in many of
 
02:39:06.630 --> 02:39:06.640 align:start position:0%
your districts I'm sure that have the
 
02:39:09.870 --> 02:39:09.880 align:start position:0%
same problem so this will really benefit
 
02:39:13.429 --> 02:39:13.439 align:start position:0%
um all of our constituents and uh can
 
02:39:16.150 --> 02:39:16.160 align:start position:0%
answer any questions and I also the
 
02:39:17.790 --> 02:39:17.800 align:start position:0%
commissioner here who can answer even
 
02:39:20.150 --> 02:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
more questions for you if you like
 
02:39:22.230 --> 02:39:22.240 align:start position:0%
so thank you thank thank you
 
02:39:25.349 --> 02:39:25.359 align:start position:0%
Senator would you believe this committee
 
02:39:27.469 --> 02:39:27.479 align:start position:0%
members are are very familiar with the
 
02:39:30.110 --> 02:39:30.120 align:start position:0%
tberry lane we' we've been discussing
 
02:39:32.950 --> 02:39:32.960 align:start position:0%
this over the course of many years uh
 
02:39:37.150 --> 02:39:37.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:40.110 --> 02:39:40.120 align:start position:0%
committee yes represent J thank you Mr
 
02:39:43.910 --> 02:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
chairman Senator this example on tberry
 
02:39:47.590 --> 02:39:47.600 align:start position:0%
and I is it this neighborhood along the
 
02:39:51.110 --> 02:39:51.120 align:start position:0%
ever Turnpike yes okay on the sbound yes
 
02:39:54.590 --> 02:39:54.600 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and if I may also add
 
02:39:58.469 --> 02:39:58.479 align:start position:0%
that you know originally it wouldn't it
 
02:40:00.030 --> 02:40:00.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be appropriate with what you
 
02:40:01.870 --> 02:40:01.880 align:start position:0%
probably saw in the past which is to
 
02:40:04.230 --> 02:40:04.240 align:start position:0%
just demand that noise barriers go in
 
02:40:06.910 --> 02:40:06.920 align:start position:0%
for tberry so trying to find a solution
 
02:40:09.230 --> 02:40:09.240 align:start position:0%
that would help all people throughout
 
02:40:12.349 --> 02:40:12.359 align:start position:0%
our state um this was the best example
 
02:40:14.269 --> 02:40:14.279 align:start position:0%
and very different from what you've
 
02:40:17.030 --> 02:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
probably seen in the past
 
02:40:20.429 --> 02:40:20.439 align:start position:0%
years thank you uh represent mil yes
 
02:40:23.590 --> 02:40:23.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator um do you happen to
 
02:40:26.309 --> 02:40:26.319 align:start position:0%
know uh and I'm going I'm only asking
 
02:40:27.590 --> 02:40:27.600 align:start position:0%
this because you said you'd been you've
 
02:40:30.110 --> 02:40:30.120 align:start position:0%
been there uh what type of uh length
 
02:40:32.469 --> 02:40:32.479 align:start position:0%
we're talking about that this noise
 
02:40:34.990 --> 02:40:35.000 align:start position:0%
Berry would have to be a mile mile and a
 
02:40:39.349 --> 02:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
half to any idea at all I believe um I
 
02:40:41.309 --> 02:40:41.319 align:start position:0%
don't know in miles but I'm going to say
 
02:40:44.790 --> 02:40:44.800 align:start position:0%
it impacts about 20 25 homes okay thank
 
02:40:48.550 --> 02:40:48.560 align:start position:0%
you so it's pretty significant um and I
 
02:40:50.590 --> 02:40:50.600 align:start position:0%
I I honestly ly if you have any doubt go
 
02:40:52.150 --> 02:40:52.160 align:start position:0%
over there and stand in one of their
 
02:40:54.150 --> 02:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
driveways you would be you would not
 
02:40:55.990 --> 02:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
want I always try to put myself in
 
02:40:57.750 --> 02:40:57.760 align:start position:0%
everyone else's shoes and let me tell
 
02:40:59.910 --> 02:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
you I wouldn't want to live there okay
 
02:41:01.550 --> 02:41:01.560 align:start position:0%
thank you further
 
02:41:04.870 --> 02:41:04.880 align:start position:0%
questions yes please represent Newman
 
02:41:08.429 --> 02:41:08.439 align:start position:0%
yes th thank you just say for argument
 
02:41:12.790 --> 02:41:12.800 align:start position:0%
sake that there's I'll say 12 um areas
 
02:41:14.990 --> 02:41:15.000 align:start position:0%
with within the state that would like to
 
02:41:18.190 --> 02:41:18.200 align:start position:0%
have sound barriers you your situation
 
02:41:20.590 --> 02:41:20.600 align:start position:0%
being one of them how would you envision
 
02:41:23.550 --> 02:41:23.560 align:start position:0%
this fund saying okay you get it and
 
02:41:25.670 --> 02:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
you're next on the list and whatever
 
02:41:27.750 --> 02:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
well the way the bill is created it's
 
02:41:30.030 --> 02:41:30.040 align:start position:0%
going to be handled by the commissioner
 
02:41:31.790 --> 02:41:31.800 align:start position:0%
and the Department of
 
02:41:34.630 --> 02:41:34.640 align:start position:0%
Transportation so I think there will be
 
02:41:37.230 --> 02:41:37.240 align:start position:0%
a um a fair and balanced way to
 
02:41:41.309 --> 02:41:41.319 align:start position:0%
determine how this should go thank you
 
02:41:43.030 --> 02:41:43.040 align:start position:0%
thank you any further further questions
 
02:41:45.950 --> 02:41:45.960 align:start position:0%
for the senator represent jge follow
 
02:41:48.710 --> 02:41:48.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and in this
 
02:41:48.720 --> 02:41:50.389 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and in this
example

02:41:50.389 --> 02:41:50.399 align:start position:0%
example
 
02:41:53.150 --> 02:41:53.160 align:start position:0%
with with the wide is is the tberry
 
02:41:55.230 --> 02:41:55.240 align:start position:0%
neighborhood going to be affected even
 
02:41:58.429 --> 02:41:58.439 align:start position:0%
more due to the widening of that's going
 
02:42:00.230 --> 02:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
on is it in that location of the
 
02:42:02.670 --> 02:42:02.680 align:start position:0%
widening as well yes they they've been
 
02:42:05.830 --> 02:42:05.840 align:start position:0%
constantly impacted and the the
 
02:42:07.750 --> 02:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation tried to do
 
02:42:10.389 --> 02:42:10.399 align:start position:0%
their best by putting up a a Stockyard
 
02:42:12.510 --> 02:42:12.520 align:start position:0%
fence which didn't do much for sound but
 
02:42:14.910 --> 02:42:14.920 align:start position:0%
at least afforded some privacy but then
 
02:42:17.670 --> 02:42:17.680 align:start position:0%
it you know it rotted it fell down um I
 
02:42:20.150 --> 02:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
can tell you one of the neighbors
 
02:42:22.950 --> 02:42:22.960 align:start position:0%
he couldn't get out of his garage
 
02:42:25.590 --> 02:42:25.600 align:start position:0%
because people decided that his driveway
 
02:42:28.190 --> 02:42:28.200 align:start position:0%
would be a good Park and Ride there's
 
02:42:30.710 --> 02:42:30.720 align:start position:0%
been people um coming to their homes
 
02:42:33.950 --> 02:42:33.960 align:start position:0%
stealing gas cans um it it's been a
 
02:42:37.590 --> 02:42:37.600 align:start position:0%
safety issue Beyond just that um the
 
02:42:40.510 --> 02:42:40.520 align:start position:0%
department now is um it's been a long go
 
02:42:41.790 --> 02:42:41.800 align:start position:0%
it's we've been talking about it for a
 
02:42:43.830 --> 02:42:43.840 align:start position:0%
year but they are trying to put up a
 
02:42:46.110 --> 02:42:46.120 align:start position:0%
better getting the permits to put up a
 
02:42:48.190 --> 02:42:48.200 align:start position:0%
little bit better of a fence and maybe
 
02:42:49.870 --> 02:42:49.880 align:start position:0%
some shrubbery
 
02:42:51.910 --> 02:42:51.920 align:start position:0%
um but it's a pretty pretty rough
 
02:42:54.550 --> 02:42:54.560 align:start position:0%
situation thank you any further
 
02:42:56.150 --> 02:42:56.160 align:start position:0%
questions for the
 
02:42:58.750 --> 02:42:58.760 align:start position:0%

[Music]

02:43:38.750 --> 02:43:38.760 align:start position:0%

Bureau of uh environment um he can
 
02:43:54.590 --> 02:43:54.600 align:start position:0%
answer any details uh about
 
02:43:57.150 --> 02:43:57.160 align:start position:0%
noise analysis how we how we do our
 
02:43:59.309 --> 02:43:59.319 align:start position:0%
studies about our policy and um you know
 
02:44:01.269 --> 02:44:01.279 align:start position:0%
I can ask any general questions about
 
02:44:03.630 --> 02:44:03.640 align:start position:0%
the financing funding toll credits Etc
 
02:44:06.070 --> 02:44:06.080 align:start position:0%
so thank you uh before we do I would
 
02:44:07.670 --> 02:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
just like to acknowledge the lady
 
02:44:12.110 --> 02:44:12.120 align:start position:0%
sitting in the back row Kathleen and who
 
02:44:14.950 --> 02:44:14.960 align:start position:0%
offered me a tremendous amount of time
 
02:44:18.349 --> 02:44:18.359 align:start position:0%
to help pull together and uh correct uh
 
02:44:20.750 --> 02:44:20.760 align:start position:0%
my house buil 2024 to make sure that we
 
02:44:24.670 --> 02:44:24.680 align:start position:0%
had correct numbers and I I always speak
 
02:44:27.309 --> 02:44:27.319 align:start position:0%
how well the staff does but I I just
 
02:44:29.190 --> 02:44:29.200 align:start position:0%
want to just say special thank you right
 
02:44:33.030 --> 02:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
here to uh to that lady yeah thank you
 
02:44:36.469 --> 02:44:36.479 align:start position:0%
all right M rep Mr
 
02:44:39.990 --> 02:44:40.000 align:start position:0%
Cass so how are how are we doing with
 
02:44:43.230 --> 02:44:43.240 align:start position:0%
toll credits overall and our uh we
 
02:44:45.150 --> 02:44:45.160 align:start position:0%
always knew that we had a mountain of
 
02:44:48.230 --> 02:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
them and by using them it lessened how
 
02:44:50.230 --> 02:44:50.240 align:start position:0%
much road work we could get done because
 
02:44:52.349 --> 02:44:52.359 align:start position:0%
it wasn't a cash
 
02:44:55.190 --> 02:44:55.200 align:start position:0%
contribution so are we are we
 
02:44:58.429 --> 02:44:58.439 align:start position:0%
experiencing still a climbing amount of
 
02:45:01.110 --> 02:45:01.120 align:start position:0%
toll credits have have we reached a peak
 
02:45:04.990 --> 02:45:05.000 align:start position:0%
and we're seeing less how how how is our
 
02:45:06.910 --> 02:45:06.920 align:start position:0%
audit of toll
 
02:45:09.349 --> 02:45:09.359 align:start position:0%
credits uh yes yeah so I have the most
 
02:45:12.030 --> 02:45:12.040 align:start position:0%
current um spreadsheet in front of me
 
02:45:15.550 --> 02:45:15.560 align:start position:0%
that we that we um uh submit the Federal
 
02:45:20.070 --> 02:45:20.080 align:start position:0%
Highway annually as as we review our um
 
02:45:23.550 --> 02:45:23.560 align:start position:0%
our our our use of of Turnpike toll
 
02:45:28.950 --> 02:45:28.960 align:start position:0%
credits and uh so we are on a decline uh
 
02:45:31.710 --> 02:45:31.720 align:start position:0%
when you mention a a mountain so I've
 
02:45:35.469 --> 02:45:35.479 align:start position:0%
got the um my spreadsheet dates back to
 
02:45:38.030 --> 02:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
1992 when we first really started in
 
02:45:40.550 --> 02:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
Earnest pursuing the uh utilization of
 
02:45:42.750 --> 02:45:42.760 align:start position:0%
toll credit so we went from a high in
 
02:45:42.760 --> 02:45:44.150 align:start position:0%
toll credit so we went from a high in
around

02:45:44.150 --> 02:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
around
 
02:45:48.389 --> 02:45:48.399 align:start position:0%
200 uh 14 of a little over $300 million
 
02:45:51.309 --> 02:45:51.319 align:start position:0%
the current balance of uh Turnpike toll
 
02:45:53.870 --> 02:45:53.880 align:start position:0%
credits is about $186
 
02:45:58.790 --> 02:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
million from a um use and utilization
 
02:45:58.800 --> 02:46:00.630 align:start position:0%
million from a um use and utilization
standpoint

02:46:00.630 --> 02:46:00.640 align:start position:0%
standpoint
 
02:46:04.670 --> 02:46:04.680 align:start position:0%
um when I look at say the last um for
 
02:46:06.469 --> 02:46:06.479 align:start position:0%
the last three years we've used between
 
02:46:09.469 --> 02:46:09.479 align:start position:0%
$40 and $50 million annually of Turnpike
 
02:46:13.510 --> 02:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
toll credits to match our uh our our
 
02:46:16.469 --> 02:46:16.479 align:start position:0%
federal program um in that same time
 
02:46:21.389 --> 02:46:21.399 align:start position:0%
frame we have we have claimed approved
 
02:46:21.399 --> 02:46:23.190 align:start position:0%
frame we have we have claimed approved
uh

02:46:23.190 --> 02:46:23.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:46:28.070 --> 02:46:28.080 align:start position:0%
between between 35 and 45 million do so
 
02:46:31.190 --> 02:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
on average in the last three years our
 
02:46:33.550 --> 02:46:33.560 align:start position:0%
utilization outweighs what we're what
 
02:46:35.070 --> 02:46:35.080 align:start position:0%
we're gaining and that's primarily
 
02:46:37.630 --> 02:46:37.640 align:start position:0%
because the um and we talked about it
 
02:46:40.710 --> 02:46:40.720 align:start position:0%
with the 10-year plan that that the the
 
02:46:44.950 --> 02:46:44.960 align:start position:0%
turnpike expenditures um are are are not
 
02:46:47.110 --> 02:46:47.120 align:start position:0%
as robust as they had been in the past
 
02:46:51.230 --> 02:46:51.240 align:start position:0%
as um um revenues have have declined and
 
02:46:53.950 --> 02:46:53.960 align:start position:0%
we're kind of more in a a one project at
 
02:46:57.110 --> 02:46:57.120 align:start position:0%
a time versus a a more robust Capital
 
02:47:00.710 --> 02:47:00.720 align:start position:0%
program there so um hopefully that
 
02:47:02.830 --> 02:47:02.840 align:start position:0%
answers answers your answers your
 
02:47:07.230 --> 02:47:07.240 align:start position:0%
question but um we haven't done a
 
02:47:10.469 --> 02:47:10.479 align:start position:0%
projection as much ahead but I I can say
 
02:47:13.469 --> 02:47:13.479 align:start position:0%
it has been a it has been a scramble um
 
02:47:15.870 --> 02:47:15.880 align:start position:0%
to meet the maintenance of effort that
 
02:47:18.030 --> 02:47:18.040 align:start position:0%
that is required to claim ter Turnpike
 
02:47:19.870 --> 02:47:19.880 align:start position:0%
toll credit so
 
02:47:22.710 --> 02:47:22.720 align:start position:0%
in the last
 
02:47:25.309 --> 02:47:25.319 align:start position:0%
um in the
 
02:47:27.590 --> 02:47:27.600 align:start position:0%
last we have been able to claim total
 
02:47:29.630 --> 02:47:29.640 align:start position:0%
credits in the last four years but for
 
02:47:31.630 --> 02:47:31.640 align:start position:0%
the three previous years uh because of
 
02:47:33.710 --> 02:47:33.720 align:start position:0%
the maintenance of effort we hadn't been
 
02:47:36.070 --> 02:47:36.080 align:start position:0%
able to I for see that being a challenge
 
02:47:38.190 --> 02:47:38.200 align:start position:0%
in in the future as well too being able
 
02:47:42.110 --> 02:47:42.120 align:start position:0%
to um claim Turnpike toll credits so
 
02:47:45.120 --> 02:47:45.130 align:start position:0%
before I open it up to other questions
 
02:47:45.130 --> 02:47:47.830 align:start position:0%
before I open it up to other questions
[Music]

02:47:47.830 --> 02:47:47.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:47:52.389 --> 02:47:52.399 align:start position:0%
so we we all know we all know the
 
02:47:56.750 --> 02:47:56.760 align:start position:0%
difficulty of um receiving Revenue to
 
02:47:59.110 --> 02:47:59.120 align:start position:0%
handle the mission you have the policy
 
02:48:02.309 --> 02:48:02.319 align:start position:0%
you have um and
 
02:48:02.319 --> 02:48:04.349 align:start position:0%
you have um and
turnpikes

02:48:04.349 --> 02:48:04.359 align:start position:0%
turnpikes
 
02:48:08.590 --> 02:48:08.600 align:start position:0%
um I guess my question is irregardless
 
02:48:12.510 --> 02:48:12.520 align:start position:0%
of whether this this idea moves
 
02:48:15.389 --> 02:48:15.399 align:start position:0%
forward and we know that we have a need
 
02:48:18.269 --> 02:48:18.279 align:start position:0%
for a new funding source or we need to
 
02:48:20.309 --> 02:48:20.319 align:start position:0%
come together together with the Senate
 
02:48:23.710 --> 02:48:23.720 align:start position:0%
and find you know some some relief here
 
02:48:26.030 --> 02:48:26.040 align:start position:0%
legislatively because people want their
 
02:48:29.630 --> 02:48:29.640 align:start position:0%
roads and highways and their Bridges
 
02:48:32.710 --> 02:48:32.720 align:start position:0%
working how long at the current rate of
 
02:48:35.070 --> 02:48:35.080 align:start position:0%
expenditure with money coming in do you
 
02:48:37.150 --> 02:48:37.160 align:start position:0%
you expect that you would have toll
 
02:48:39.750 --> 02:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
credits for that benefit so you're
 
02:48:41.950 --> 02:48:41.960 align:start position:0%
you're spending more than over the last
 
02:48:43.590 --> 02:48:43.600 align:start position:0%
four years you're spending more than you
 
02:48:45.990 --> 02:48:46.000 align:start position:0%
have coming in correct right is it a
 
02:48:47.550 --> 02:48:47.560 align:start position:0%
concern to
 
02:48:52.750 --> 02:48:52.760 align:start position:0%
you uh uh yes yes it is it is a concern
 
02:48:56.070 --> 02:48:56.080 align:start position:0%
um if if it goes on at at at at this
 
02:48:58.150 --> 02:48:58.160 align:start position:0%
rate so if I look at like the last
 
02:49:01.030 --> 02:49:01.040 align:start position:0%
threeyear average we're we're we're
 
02:49:05.190 --> 02:49:05.200 align:start position:0%
probably um about a $10 million a year
 
02:49:08.269 --> 02:49:08.279 align:start position:0%
deficit on average um if that if that
 
02:49:11.349 --> 02:49:11.359 align:start position:0%
continues you know $189 million of the
 
02:49:14.309 --> 02:49:14.319 align:start position:0%
current current balance will would would
 
02:49:17.429 --> 02:49:17.439 align:start position:0%
extend for some time
 
02:49:20.990 --> 02:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
um no knowing knowing the tentativeness
 
02:49:23.229 --> 02:49:23.239 align:start position:0%
of the of the turnpike financing
 
02:49:25.110 --> 02:49:25.120 align:start position:0%
situations particularly with regard to
 
02:49:28.429 --> 02:49:28.439 align:start position:0%
the capital program um I think that that
 
02:49:30.269 --> 02:49:30.279 align:start position:0%
that's going to be a it's going to be a
 
02:49:31.990 --> 02:49:32.000 align:start position:0%
challenge to meet the maintenance of
 
02:49:35.309 --> 02:49:35.319 align:start position:0%
effort in which case then uh we wouldn't
 
02:49:37.349 --> 02:49:37.359 align:start position:0%
be able to claim Turnpike toll credits
 
02:49:40.150 --> 02:49:40.160 align:start position:0%
and our spend rate would be in that $45
 
02:49:43.110 --> 02:49:43.120 align:start position:0%
to $50 million a year to match the the
 
02:49:47.630 --> 02:49:47.640 align:start position:0%
federal program um if that scenario came
 
02:49:50.429 --> 02:49:50.439 align:start position:0%
about the present balance would would
 
02:49:56.190 --> 02:49:56.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:00.030 --> 02:50:00.040 align:start position:0%
years that's a that's a stark reality to
 
02:50:04.429 --> 02:50:04.439 align:start position:0%
me um now if if I could switch gears so
 
02:50:06.389 --> 02:50:06.399 align:start position:0%
I and
 
02:50:09.349 --> 02:50:09.359 align:start position:0%
um I wasn't here for that presentation
 
02:50:12.349 --> 02:50:12.359 align:start position:0%
this year but I'm sure the
 
02:50:16.790 --> 02:50:16.800 align:start position:0%
U um the majority of the members here uh
 
02:50:19.429 --> 02:50:19.439 align:start position:0%
realize the struggle that the department
 
02:50:24.910 --> 02:50:24.920 align:start position:0%
has had to date on how to fund outside
 
02:50:28.269 --> 02:50:28.279 align:start position:0%
of the U of the cost of the highway and
 
02:50:31.229 --> 02:50:31.239 align:start position:0%
the federal eligibility of
 
02:50:33.830 --> 02:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
where um sound barriers could be
 
02:50:36.510 --> 02:50:36.520 align:start position:0%
constructed there's a much larger need
 
02:50:39.309 --> 02:50:39.319 align:start position:0%
than what we are and tberry we've been
 
02:50:43.870 --> 02:50:43.880 align:start position:0%
talking about for years and and with the
 
02:50:43.880 --> 02:50:44.670 align:start position:0%
talking about for years and and with the
I

02:50:44.670 --> 02:50:44.680 align:start position:0%
I
 
02:50:48.670 --> 02:50:48.680 align:start position:0%
apologize with the um not meeting
 
02:50:50.790 --> 02:50:50.800 align:start position:0%
eligibility to be able to pull those
 
02:50:54.229 --> 02:50:54.239 align:start position:0%
funds and not having the enormous cost
 
02:50:57.150 --> 02:50:57.160 align:start position:0%
typically to construct those barriers
 
02:50:58.910 --> 02:50:58.920 align:start position:0%
that we don't have money in our 10-year
 
02:51:00.349 --> 02:51:00.359 align:start position:0%
plan to do it
 
02:51:03.630 --> 02:51:03.640 align:start position:0%
either is this proposal as it's being
 
02:51:07.429 --> 02:51:07.439 align:start position:0%
brought forward is is this possible to
 
02:51:07.439 --> 02:51:08.269 align:start position:0%
brought forward is is this possible to
even

02:51:08.269 --> 02:51:08.279 align:start position:0%
even
 
02:51:15.590 --> 02:51:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:19.229 --> 02:51:19.239 align:start position:0%
credits um would this which require a
 
02:51:22.429 --> 02:51:22.439 align:start position:0%
federal change in regulations well one
 
02:51:25.469 --> 02:51:25.479 align:start position:0%
of the issue what what this hinges on is
 
02:51:28.389 --> 02:51:28.399 align:start position:0%
is What's called the toll toll credit
 
02:51:31.110 --> 02:51:31.120 align:start position:0%
Marketplace so in the last
 
02:51:35.750 --> 02:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
reauthorization there was um there was
 
02:51:37.790 --> 02:51:37.800 align:start position:0%
language that would approve the
 
02:51:40.030 --> 02:51:40.040 align:start position:0%
establishment of a toll credit
 
02:51:42.229 --> 02:51:42.239 align:start position:0%
marketplace where if we had or some
 
02:51:45.269 --> 02:51:45.279 align:start position:0%
other state had excess toll credits that
 
02:51:47.830 --> 02:51:47.840 align:start position:0%
we didn't need to match match our our
 
02:51:50.190 --> 02:51:50.200 align:start position:0%
our program we could go to some
 
02:51:52.590 --> 02:51:52.600 align:start position:0%
Marketplace and other other states could
 
02:51:54.429 --> 02:51:54.439 align:start position:0%
buy our toll credits other states that
 
02:51:57.110 --> 02:51:57.120 align:start position:0%
were probably that were say having
 
02:51:59.710 --> 02:51:59.720 align:start position:0%
trouble matching their their federal
 
02:52:00.910 --> 02:52:00.920 align:start position:0%
dollars because they didn't have enough
 
02:52:03.870 --> 02:52:03.880 align:start position:0%
State dollars or something so um that
 
02:52:06.469 --> 02:52:06.479 align:start position:0%
was the concept that was the idea so
 
02:52:08.910 --> 02:52:08.920 align:start position:0%
technically there is uh the
 
02:52:10.269 --> 02:52:10.279 align:start position:0%
establishment of a toll credit
 
02:52:12.550 --> 02:52:12.560 align:start position:0%
Marketplace within the
 
02:52:16.150 --> 02:52:16.160 align:start position:0%
reauthorization there has not been so
 
02:52:18.150 --> 02:52:18.160 align:start position:0%
the ability to establish a toll credit
 
02:52:20.389 --> 02:52:20.399 align:start position:0%
Market places in the legislation there
 
02:52:22.950 --> 02:52:22.960 align:start position:0%
haven't been steps to establish that
 
02:52:25.630 --> 02:52:25.640 align:start position:0%
Marketplace so presently the short
 
02:52:27.630 --> 02:52:27.640 align:start position:0%
answer to your question is no presently
 
02:52:29.670 --> 02:52:29.680 align:start position:0%
there isn't Federal
 
02:52:32.389 --> 02:52:32.399 align:start position:0%
authorization um I don't know if it
 
02:52:34.349 --> 02:52:34.359 align:start position:0%
requires rul making or or or something
 
02:52:35.830 --> 02:52:35.840 align:start position:0%
to implement what is in the
 
02:52:38.269 --> 02:52:38.279 align:start position:0%
authorization but um presently there
 
02:52:40.190 --> 02:52:40.200 align:start position:0%
isn't a toll credit Marketplace to take
 
02:52:42.150 --> 02:52:42.160 align:start position:0%
advantage of that's not to say that at
 
02:52:45.110 --> 02:52:45.120 align:start position:0%
some point in the future that that that
 
02:52:47.150 --> 02:52:47.160 align:start position:0%
that may get um
 
02:52:53.469 --> 02:52:53.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:55.710 --> 02:52:55.720 align:start position:0%
myself I'm not I'm not one that ever
 
02:52:58.269 --> 02:52:58.279 align:start position:0%
bought into Bitcoin so I'll just thr
 
02:53:00.870 --> 02:53:00.880 align:start position:0%
right out there it would it would see it
 
02:53:05.190 --> 02:53:05.200 align:start position:0%
would seem to me that if we were to put
 
02:53:08.910 --> 02:53:08.920 align:start position:0%
toll credits out there in this market if
 
02:53:11.750 --> 02:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
there was to be an auction at that point
 
02:53:15.190 --> 02:53:15.200 align:start position:0%
it would seem to me that what we
 
02:53:17.990 --> 02:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't get more revenue for those
 
02:53:21.510 --> 02:53:21.520 align:start position:0%
through the this process then what we
 
02:53:23.710 --> 02:53:23.720 align:start position:0%
can have for
 
02:53:26.990 --> 02:53:27.000 align:start position:0%
value with our own state would there
 
02:53:29.710 --> 02:53:29.720 align:start position:0%
be am I incorrect in that are people
 
02:53:33.229 --> 02:53:33.239 align:start position:0%
paying above market rate for those no no
 
02:53:34.630 --> 02:53:34.640 align:start position:0%
I don't think so I think you are correct
 
02:53:36.590 --> 02:53:36.600 align:start position:0%
I mean I I I I don't know what values
 
02:53:38.870 --> 02:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
there would be but I think it
 
02:53:41.190 --> 02:53:41.200 align:start position:0%
was it was
 
02:53:44.790 --> 02:53:44.800 align:start position:0%
assumed that any any any any toll credit
 
02:53:47.030 --> 02:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
Marketplace the the the value of the
 
02:53:49.950 --> 02:53:49.960 align:start position:0%
credits would somehow be be be
 
02:53:51.830 --> 02:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
discounted and in other words if
 
02:53:55.550 --> 02:53:55.560 align:start position:0%
somebody bought $100 of toll credits for
 
02:53:58.630 --> 02:53:58.640 align:start position:0%
they bid against in this Marketplace but
 
02:54:00.269 --> 02:54:00.279 align:start position:0%
the it certainly wouldn't be greater
 
02:54:02.510 --> 02:54:02.520 align:start position:0%
than the face value I I I think the
 
02:54:05.229 --> 02:54:05.239 align:start position:0%
benefit would be if uh thank you for
 
02:54:08.469 --> 02:54:08.479 align:start position:0%
that so and um I'll break my own rule
 
02:54:11.030 --> 02:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
here of course so how much how much
 
02:54:14.349 --> 02:54:14.359 align:start position:0%
money or tool credits is anticipated in
 
02:54:14.359 --> 02:54:15.510 align:start position:0%
money or tool credits is anticipated in
this

02:54:15.510 --> 02:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:54:18.950 --> 02:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
proposal is it is it open for
 
02:54:20.550 --> 02:54:20.560 align:start position:0%
I think the toll credits are estimated
 
02:54:25.750 --> 02:54:25.760 align:start position:0%
to sell up to 10 $10 million per year um
 
02:54:27.790 --> 02:54:27.800 align:start position:0%
in compliance with Federal rules and
 
02:54:30.190 --> 02:54:30.200 align:start position:0%
regulations um the one the one part
 
02:54:31.950 --> 02:54:31.960 align:start position:0%
about this bill that that I do like is
 
02:54:35.710 --> 02:54:35.720 align:start position:0%
it does um it does
 
02:54:38.950 --> 02:54:38.960 align:start position:0%
um if you look at uh lines four and five
 
02:54:40.590 --> 02:54:40.600 align:start position:0%
there the very first part does talk
 
02:54:42.349 --> 02:54:42.359 align:start position:0%
about uh provided that there are
 
02:54:44.269 --> 02:54:44.279 align:start position:0%
sufficient Turnpike toll credits for the
 
02:54:45.670 --> 02:54:45.680 align:start position:0%
state match for the federal
 
02:54:48.429 --> 02:54:48.439 align:start position:0%
apportionment totals for 5 years based
 
02:54:49.670 --> 02:54:49.680 align:start position:0%
on the current fiscal year and the
 
02:54:52.590 --> 02:54:52.600 align:start position:0%
preceding four so I probably reading
 
02:54:54.750 --> 02:54:54.760 align:start position:0%
that I tried to give you like the last
 
02:54:57.389 --> 02:54:57.399 align:start position:0%
the the the last five years of of
 
02:55:01.389 --> 02:55:01.399 align:start position:0%
average and stuff and and based on our
 
02:55:04.389 --> 02:55:04.399 align:start position:0%
um based on that at the present time I I
 
02:55:05.910 --> 02:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
you know I I don't think we would have
 
02:55:09.830 --> 02:55:09.840 align:start position:0%
the availability of of toll credits to
 
02:55:12.349 --> 02:55:12.359 align:start position:0%
um put aside $10 million a year if there
 
02:55:14.150 --> 02:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
was a Marketplace but that's at current
 
02:55:18.830 --> 02:55:18.840 align:start position:0%
time um I I do think the bill does uh uh
 
02:55:21.510 --> 02:55:21.520 align:start position:0%
recognize an issue that that that that
 
02:55:24.030 --> 02:55:24.040 align:start position:0%
has been um on a lot of people's minds
 
02:55:28.710 --> 02:55:28.720 align:start position:0%
as far as a a way to fund um uh sound
 
02:55:31.269 --> 02:55:31.279 align:start position:0%
barriers and mitigate highway highway
 
02:55:31.279 --> 02:55:32.990 align:start position:0%
barriers and mitigate highway highway
noise

02:55:32.990 --> 02:55:33.000 align:start position:0%
noise
 
02:55:36.269 --> 02:55:36.279 align:start position:0%
um so if if anything at least th this
 
02:55:41.309 --> 02:55:41.319 align:start position:0%
bill does signal uh an an intent that uh
 
02:55:45.630 --> 02:55:45.640 align:start position:0%
it is that it is a um an an issue and an
 
02:55:48.710 --> 02:55:48.720 align:start position:0%
attempt to find some way to uh find find
 
02:55:50.990 --> 02:55:51.000 align:start position:0%
a way to fund fund them whether this
 
02:55:53.670 --> 02:55:53.680 align:start position:0%
mechanism is is appropriate in the short
 
02:55:56.750 --> 02:55:56.760 align:start position:0%
or long term um is questionable I think
 
02:55:57.990 --> 02:55:58.000 align:start position:0%
thank you and I and I agree with your
 
02:56:00.309 --> 02:56:00.319 align:start position:0%
statment questions for the
 
02:56:05.190 --> 02:56:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:07.630 --> 02:56:07.640 align:start position:0%
foli just pull that a little closer to
 
02:56:10.550 --> 02:56:10.560 align:start position:0%
you do we have any idea what this
 
02:56:14.630 --> 02:56:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:18.309 --> 02:56:18.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh this this this bill
 
02:56:20.670 --> 02:56:20.680 align:start position:0%
specific or this specific
 
02:56:24.229 --> 02:56:24.239 align:start position:0%
project I mean th this bill I saw a
 
02:56:26.269 --> 02:56:26.279 align:start position:0%
figure over here that said Point
 
02:56:27.750 --> 02:56:27.760 align:start position:0%
represent could you just pull the mic a
 
02:56:30.389 --> 02:56:30.399 align:start position:0%
little closer to you someone assist the
 
02:56:32.190 --> 02:56:32.200 align:start position:0%
representative just pull what bothers me
 
02:56:35.469 --> 02:56:35.479 align:start position:0%
is the last paragra hold hold your
 
02:56:35.479 --> 02:56:36.510 align:start position:0%
is the last paragra hold hold your
comment

02:56:36.510 --> 02:56:36.520 align:start position:0%
comment
 
02:56:40.269 --> 02:56:40.279 align:start position:0%
suspend There You Go sir all
 
02:56:44.070 --> 02:56:44.080 align:start position:0%
right the last paragraph This is a hugee
 
02:56:46.110 --> 02:56:46.120 align:start position:0%
question mark on the final cost of this
 
02:56:46.120 --> 02:56:47.229 align:start position:0%
question mark on the final cost of this
whole

02:56:47.229 --> 02:56:47.239 align:start position:0%
whole
 
02:56:47.239 --> 02:56:52.590 align:start position:0%
whole
project

02:56:52.590 --> 02:56:52.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:54.269 --> 02:56:54.279 align:start position:0%
well the I mean the the the bill is
 
02:56:55.990 --> 02:56:56.000 align:start position:0%
amended by the Senate talks about
 
02:56:58.309 --> 02:56:58.319 align:start position:0%
spending $10 million a year in toll
 
02:57:00.950 --> 02:57:00.960 align:start position:0%
credits to put toward a program to fund
 
02:57:02.990 --> 02:57:03.000 align:start position:0%
sound walls I know Senator richardi was
 
02:57:03.000 --> 02:57:04.070 align:start position:0%
sound walls I know Senator richardi was
talking

02:57:04.070 --> 02:57:04.080 align:start position:0%
talking
 
02:57:07.389 --> 02:57:07.399 align:start position:0%
specifically about uh T tberry Lane and
 
02:57:10.309 --> 02:57:10.319 align:start position:0%
and that was the impetus uh behind this
 
02:57:14.110 --> 02:57:14.120 align:start position:0%
bill but uh I as it as it was amended by
 
02:57:16.349 --> 02:57:16.359 align:start position:0%
the Senate it doesn't
 
02:57:18.830 --> 02:57:18.840 align:start position:0%
specifically fund
 
02:57:20.790 --> 02:57:20.800 align:start position:0%
uh tberry Lane if that if that's what
 
02:57:23.550 --> 02:57:23.560 align:start position:0%
you're asking yeah this I'm asking yeah
 
02:57:25.910 --> 02:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
this bill do we have any idea what the
 
02:57:29.110 --> 02:57:29.120 align:start position:0%
final cost is going to be to the
 
02:57:32.429 --> 02:57:32.439 align:start position:0%
taxpayers of New Hampshire pure and
 
02:57:34.469 --> 02:57:34.479 align:start position:0%
simple so we can by the limits
 
02:57:37.750 --> 02:57:37.760 align:start position:0%
establishing the bill it would be um you
 
02:57:39.910 --> 02:57:39.920 align:start position:0%
know to sell up to $10 million per year
 
02:57:42.150 --> 02:57:42.160 align:start position:0%
in Turnpike toll credits and whatever
 
02:57:43.710 --> 02:57:43.720 align:start position:0%
revenue from the sale of that $10
 
02:57:46.710 --> 02:57:46.720 align:start position:0%
million we would put toward this
 
02:57:49.790 --> 02:57:49.800 align:start position:0%
program so I explained to uh chairman
 
02:57:53.150 --> 02:57:53.160 align:start position:0%
mcon you know the the final value if if
 
02:57:55.269 --> 02:57:55.279 align:start position:0%
this was implemented would would be
 
02:57:58.229 --> 02:57:58.239 align:start position:0%
dependent on the sale of those $10
 
02:58:02.349 --> 02:58:02.359 align:start position:0%
million of of um toll credits but
 
02:58:05.870 --> 02:58:05.880 align:start position:0%
um it would be I think at a at an an
 
02:58:08.429 --> 02:58:08.439 align:start position:0%
expense of that that Val that credit
 
02:58:10.510 --> 02:58:10.520 align:start position:0%
value of $10 million so I think it is a
 
02:58:13.870 --> 02:58:13.880 align:start position:0%
fairly established cost as as relayed in
 
02:58:16.349 --> 02:58:16.359 align:start position:0%
the Senate amended
 
02:58:18.990 --> 02:58:19.000 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you further questions yes
 
02:58:20.550 --> 02:58:20.560 align:start position:0%
represent pulner
 
02:58:23.510 --> 02:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
please I maybe reasing the question that
 
02:58:26.269 --> 02:58:26.279 align:start position:0%
representative vvi asked but at one time
 
02:58:28.110 --> 02:58:28.120 align:start position:0%
didn't we we
 
02:58:31.150 --> 02:58:31.160 align:start position:0%
were a session or two ago we were
 
02:58:35.030 --> 02:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
looking at a total program of of uh you
 
02:58:37.229 --> 02:58:37.239 align:start position:0%
know perhaps a hundred places where
 
02:58:40.269 --> 02:58:40.279 align:start position:0%
noise barriers might be listed might be
 
02:58:43.070 --> 02:58:43.080 align:start position:0%
created and that list was in some kind
 
02:58:45.510 --> 02:58:45.520 align:start position:0%
of priority order do we have an idea of
 
02:58:48.309 --> 02:58:48.319 align:start position:0%
how big that list is and you know and
 
02:58:49.990 --> 02:58:50.000 align:start position:0%
apparently there there's some point at
 
02:58:52.469 --> 02:58:52.479 align:start position:0%
which anything below that is no longer
 
02:58:55.110 --> 02:58:55.120 align:start position:0%
cost effective and wouldn't wouldn't be
 
02:58:57.950 --> 02:58:57.960 align:start position:0%
eligible is have we estimated that as
 
02:59:01.429 --> 02:59:01.439 align:start position:0%
part of this uh this bill um I don't
 
02:59:03.110 --> 02:59:03.120 align:start position:0%
know if we've estimated as part of this
 
02:59:04.670 --> 02:59:04.680 align:start position:0%
bill but you are correct we have done it
 
02:59:06.590 --> 02:59:06.600 align:start position:0%
in the past John has the spreadsheet in
 
02:59:08.830 --> 02:59:08.840 align:start position:0%
front of them um I could speak off
 
02:59:11.670 --> 02:59:11.680 align:start position:0%
recollection do you do you want in Broad
 
02:59:14.349 --> 02:59:14.359 align:start position:0%
figures what we have for estimate and
 
02:59:16.590 --> 02:59:16.600 align:start position:0%
and again this isn't
 
02:59:19.389 --> 02:59:19.399 align:start position:0%
necessarily specific to to to the bill
 
02:59:21.870 --> 02:59:21.880 align:start position:0%
but we have identified what the what
 
02:59:26.309 --> 02:59:26.319 align:start position:0%
the um overall kind of
 
02:59:31.630 --> 02:59:31.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:36.070 --> 02:59:36.080 align:start position:0%
so thank you so um it's it as you can
 
02:59:38.309 --> 02:59:38.319 align:start position:0%
imagine it's it's a little bit difficult
 
02:59:40.389 --> 02:59:40.399 align:start position:0%
to to directly answer that because
 
02:59:42.110 --> 02:59:42.120 align:start position:0%
there's there's certain barriers that
 
02:59:44.950 --> 02:59:44.960 align:start position:0%
may or may not be eligible and so back
 
02:59:48.469 --> 02:59:48.479 align:start position:0%
in 2017 we did a did a study to to
 
02:59:50.510 --> 02:59:50.520 align:start position:0%
identify all the potential locations
 
02:59:52.510 --> 02:59:52.520 align:start position:0%
throughout the state that had
 
02:59:57.429 --> 02:59:57.439 align:start position:0%
about uh 260 locations throughout the
 
03:00:01.630 --> 03:00:01.640 align:start position:0%
state that that have homes within
 
03:00:05.150 --> 03:00:05.160 align:start position:0%
approximately 500 feet of the highway so
 
03:00:06.590 --> 03:00:06.600 align:start position:0%
that's that's kind of and and we're
 
03:00:09.150 --> 03:00:09.160 align:start position:0%
talking you know the the tier one
 
03:00:11.630 --> 03:00:11.640 align:start position:0%
highways throughout the state so so that
 
03:00:15.870 --> 03:00:15.880 align:start position:0%
that would be um you know essentially
 
03:00:18.830 --> 03:00:18.840 align:start position:0%
the the the potential locations but not
 
03:00:21.750 --> 03:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
all of those have necessarily noise
 
03:00:25.110 --> 03:00:25.120 align:start position:0%
impacts but but in in general and you
 
03:00:26.870 --> 03:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
are correct that you at a certain point
 
03:00:28.750 --> 03:00:28.760 align:start position:0%
you start dropping off the list of being
 
03:00:30.830 --> 03:00:30.840 align:start position:0%
eligible for our policy as it as it's
 
03:00:32.950 --> 03:00:32.960 align:start position:0%
written now and qualifying for federal
 
03:00:35.630 --> 03:00:35.640 align:start position:0%
funds and and and whatnot but it's in
 
03:00:40.790 --> 03:00:40.800 align:start position:0%
the ballpark of about um at our current
 
03:00:44.389 --> 03:00:44.399 align:start position:0%
rates it would probably if every barrier
 
03:00:46.429 --> 03:00:46.439 align:start position:0%
were built that would
 
03:00:48.550 --> 03:00:48.560 align:start position:0%
be that is
 
03:00:50.990 --> 03:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
anticipated to be eligible and then and
 
03:00:53.510 --> 03:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
and I say this with the caveat that this
 
03:00:57.550 --> 03:00:57.560 align:start position:0%
was a planning study and it's not um it
 
03:00:59.309 --> 03:00:59.319 align:start position:0%
it it doesn't make a formal
 
03:01:01.070 --> 03:01:01.080 align:start position:0%
determination of Eligibility but it
 
03:01:03.870 --> 03:01:03.880 align:start position:0%
would be approximately at current
 
03:01:03.880 --> 03:01:06.190 align:start position:0%
would be approximately at current
costs

03:01:06.190 --> 03:01:06.200 align:start position:0%
costs
 
03:01:06.200 --> 03:01:07.950 align:start position:0%
costs
about

03:01:07.950 --> 03:01:07.960 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:01:07.960 --> 03:01:10.269 align:start position:0%
about
760

03:01:10.269 --> 03:01:10.279 align:start position:0%
760
 
03:01:12.790 --> 03:01:12.800 align:start position:0%
million so
 
03:01:15.349 --> 03:01:15.359 align:start position:0%
um that gives you a rough idea of what
 
03:01:16.910 --> 03:01:16.920 align:start position:0%
what that would
 
03:01:16.920 --> 03:01:18.590 align:start position:0%
what that would
cost

03:01:18.590 --> 03:01:18.600 align:start position:0%
cost
 
03:01:21.710 --> 03:01:21.720 align:start position:0%
thank you yes please
 
03:01:24.269 --> 03:01:24.279 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chairman
 
03:01:26.309 --> 03:01:26.319 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my questions I got
 
03:01:27.790 --> 03:01:27.800 align:start position:0%
a couple questions
 
03:01:32.469 --> 03:01:32.479 align:start position:0%
if depending on the answers uh will this
 
03:01:35.309 --> 03:01:35.319 align:start position:0%
fund be used to fund non-term pipe
 
03:01:38.229 --> 03:01:38.239 align:start position:0%
projects as far as these noise barriers
 
03:01:38.239 --> 03:01:40.030 align:start position:0%
projects as far as these noise barriers
are

03:01:40.030 --> 03:01:40.040 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:01:42.389 --> 03:01:42.399 align:start position:0%
concerned I yes I believe that would be
 
03:01:45.349 --> 03:01:45.359 align:start position:0%
the intent our type two program is uh
 
03:01:46.990 --> 03:01:47.000 align:start position:0%
and and this reference is kind of the
 
03:01:48.990 --> 03:01:49.000 align:start position:0%
type two policy
 
03:01:54.590 --> 03:01:54.600 align:start position:0%
um is um is based on on on needs um
 
03:01:55.910 --> 03:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
along both the interstate and the
 
03:02:00.590 --> 03:02:00.600 align:start position:0%
Turnpike system follow um I could be
 
03:02:03.590 --> 03:02:03.600 align:start position:0%
wrong and probably am but I thought the
 
03:02:07.710 --> 03:02:07.720 align:start position:0%
tolls that were taken were only used for
 
03:02:11.269 --> 03:02:11.279 align:start position:0%
Turnpike projects so selling to me if
 
03:02:14.030 --> 03:02:14.040 align:start position:0%
you're selling a toll
 
03:02:17.229 --> 03:02:17.239 align:start position:0%
credit that would be encumbered into the
 
03:02:18.349 --> 03:02:18.359 align:start position:0%
same thing
 
03:02:23.229 --> 03:02:23.239 align:start position:0%
as collecting tolls so how do we have
 
03:02:27.990 --> 03:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
the mechanism to take Turnpike money and
 
03:02:30.070 --> 03:02:30.080 align:start position:0%
start to pay for non-
 
03:02:33.349 --> 03:02:33.359 align:start position:0%
Turnpike items if you understand what
 
03:02:35.510 --> 03:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
I'm asking y I do and and maybe it's a a
 
03:02:37.269 --> 03:02:37.279 align:start position:0%
brief explanation of what the turnpike
 
03:02:39.510 --> 03:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
toll credit is so while it has Turnpike
 
03:02:42.229 --> 03:02:42.239 align:start position:0%
in its name the turnpike toll credit is
 
03:02:44.550 --> 03:02:44.560 align:start position:0%
a recognition by by the federal
 
03:02:47.550 --> 03:02:47.560 align:start position:0%
government of the investment we make in
 
03:02:49.429 --> 03:02:49.439 align:start position:0%
state State dollars in the turnpike
 
03:02:52.429 --> 03:02:52.439 align:start position:0%
system so because we invest State
 
03:02:54.670 --> 03:02:54.680 align:start position:0%
dollars Turnpike dollars only in the
 
03:02:57.269 --> 03:02:57.279 align:start position:0%
turnpike system we are able to claim a
 
03:03:01.110 --> 03:03:01.120 align:start position:0%
credit on the federal federal side so um
 
03:03:03.229 --> 03:03:03.239 align:start position:0%
we earn a credit with the federal
 
03:03:05.950 --> 03:03:05.960 align:start position:0%
government that we can put towards our
 
03:03:09.790 --> 03:03:09.800 align:start position:0%
federal um match requirements so while
 
03:03:14.070 --> 03:03:14.080 align:start position:0%
it is earned or generated based on the
 
03:03:15.910 --> 03:03:15.920 align:start position:0%
investment in the turnpike system it
 
03:03:19.550 --> 03:03:19.560 align:start position:0%
really is more of a of a credit to our
 
03:03:23.030 --> 03:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
uh um a credit to the match requirement
 
03:03:24.710 --> 03:03:24.720 align:start position:0%
of our federal
 
03:03:27.750 --> 03:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
program okay follow up one more follow
 
03:03:32.269 --> 03:03:32.279 align:start position:0%
yes you may uh thank you Mr chairman now
 
03:03:35.229 --> 03:03:35.239 align:start position:0%
in the bill it says 10
 
03:03:38.429 --> 03:03:38.439 align:start position:0%
million dollars worth of credits is that
 
03:03:41.510 --> 03:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
retail value at 10 million or is that
 
03:03:41.520 --> 03:03:42.550 align:start position:0%
retail value at 10 million or is that
the

03:03:42.550 --> 03:03:42.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:03:46.309 --> 03:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
net equaling 10 million I'm kind of I
 
03:03:48.070 --> 03:03:48.080 align:start position:0%
would interpret that as so we have on
 
03:03:50.349 --> 03:03:50.359 align:start position:0%
the books a certain value of Turnpike
 
03:03:52.990 --> 03:03:53.000 align:start position:0%
toll credits so I would I would equate
 
03:03:56.670 --> 03:03:56.680 align:start position:0%
that as um essentially the face value of
 
03:03:59.269 --> 03:03:59.279 align:start position:0%
those of those Turnpike toll credits
 
03:04:01.670 --> 03:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
whether that $10 million in in toll
 
03:04:04.349 --> 03:04:04.359 align:start position:0%
credits on this
 
03:04:07.070 --> 03:04:07.080 align:start position:0%
Marketplace um translates into $10
 
03:04:10.830 --> 03:04:10.840 align:start position:0%
million of of of value or or something
 
03:04:12.469 --> 03:04:12.479 align:start position:0%
less I think that was the question that
 
03:04:15.190 --> 03:04:15.200 align:start position:0%
representative mcon was getting at um
 
03:04:17.469 --> 03:04:17.479 align:start position:0%
but I would view it as $10 million of
 
03:04:19.389 --> 03:04:19.399 align:start position:0%
face value of of toll credits and
 
03:04:23.510 --> 03:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
whatever value we could get for it um on
 
03:04:27.229 --> 03:04:27.239 align:start position:0%
whatever Marketplace is establish likely
 
03:04:30.630 --> 03:04:30.640 align:start position:0%
it would be some usable cash value of
 
03:04:33.830 --> 03:04:33.840 align:start position:0%
less than the $10 million credit but
 
03:04:37.830 --> 03:04:37.840 align:start position:0%
okay one last fin question yes thank you
 
03:04:42.870 --> 03:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
I appreciate your uh patience
 
03:04:48.070 --> 03:04:48.080 align:start position:0%
um the last one is if this bill is
 
03:04:51.550 --> 03:04:51.560 align:start position:0%
successful and uh you're able to set up
 
03:04:53.269 --> 03:04:53.279 align:start position:0%
this $10 million
 
03:04:56.910 --> 03:04:56.920 align:start position:0%
fund then you will at some point create
 
03:04:56.920 --> 03:04:58.510 align:start position:0%
fund then you will at some point create
a

03:04:58.510 --> 03:04:58.520 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:05:01.710 --> 03:05:01.720 align:start position:0%
list and prioritize this
 
03:05:06.389 --> 03:05:06.399 align:start position:0%
list yes so the ex I'm assuming this
 
03:05:09.910 --> 03:05:09.920 align:start position:0%
methodology they used here is an as an
 
03:05:12.469 --> 03:05:12.479 align:start position:0%
example and doesn't guarantee it's first
 
03:05:15.429 --> 03:05:15.439 align:start position:0%
priority or is this automatically first
 
03:05:19.110 --> 03:05:19.120 align:start position:0%
priority and then we move on to the rest
 
03:05:22.630 --> 03:05:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:25.750 --> 03:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
list uh I'm not sure what you meant by
 
03:05:27.309 --> 03:05:27.319 align:start position:0%
by what's established here it's first
 
03:05:29.229 --> 03:05:29.239 align:start position:0%
priority this this references a lot of
 
03:05:33.070 --> 03:05:33.080 align:start position:0%
our type two policy Lane Priority One or
 
03:05:36.110 --> 03:05:36.120 align:start position:0%
not I would say no no even though even
 
03:05:38.229 --> 03:05:38.239 align:start position:0%
though that is the impetus of of of the
 
03:05:40.429 --> 03:05:40.439 align:start position:0%
bill the bill text doesn't reference
 
03:05:42.389 --> 03:05:42.399 align:start position:0%
specifically tberry Lane it talks about
 
03:05:45.389 --> 03:05:45.399 align:start position:0%
a type two policy um which does have
 
03:05:47.750 --> 03:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
some other matching requirements that
 
03:05:51.229 --> 03:05:51.239 align:start position:0%
that we look to also have some um
 
03:05:53.150 --> 03:05:53.160 align:start position:0%
Community investment and participation
 
03:05:56.590 --> 03:05:56.600 align:start position:0%
and ownership um as as well too so we do
 
03:05:59.510 --> 03:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
have a prioritized list um there also
 
03:06:02.630 --> 03:06:02.640 align:start position:0%
has to be uh local community support um
 
03:06:06.269 --> 03:06:06.279 align:start position:0%
as well thank you repr Mills thank you
 
03:06:07.990 --> 03:06:08.000 align:start position:0%
Mr chair uh this is just for the benefit
 
03:06:10.630 --> 03:06:10.640 align:start position:0%
of most of the committee that hasn't
 
03:06:13.030 --> 03:06:13.040 align:start position:0%
heard this as many times as some of us
 
03:06:16.950 --> 03:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
has uh the sound barriers are still
 
03:06:16.960 --> 03:06:18.070 align:start position:0%
has uh the sound barriers are still
approxim

03:06:18.070 --> 03:06:18.080 align:start position:0%
approxim
 
03:06:22.469 --> 03:06:22.479 align:start position:0%
L cost is about a million dollar a mile
 
03:06:24.590 --> 03:06:24.600 align:start position:0%
is that is that still a current to you
 
03:06:27.950 --> 03:06:27.960 align:start position:0%
John do you have more current
 
03:06:30.550 --> 03:06:30.560 align:start position:0%
uh we typically don't calculate it based
 
03:06:34.550 --> 03:06:34.560 align:start position:0%
upon mile um so it's a it's more about
 
03:06:37.590 --> 03:06:37.600 align:start position:0%
uh because it it it some some need to be
 
03:06:40.309 --> 03:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
taller than others so and and they're
 
03:06:43.510 --> 03:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
approximately $100 per square foot the
 
03:06:49.469 --> 03:06:49.479 align:start position:0%
average barrier is 16t um you know so
 
03:06:50.990 --> 03:06:51.000 align:start position:0%
so you could you could kind of do the
 
03:06:54.670 --> 03:06:54.680 align:start position:0%
math from there but um that's what dot
 
03:06:55.910 --> 03:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
is for
 
03:06:58.630 --> 03:06:58.640 align:start position:0%
that's we've we've always had the math
 
03:07:01.469 --> 03:07:01.479 align:start position:0%
of a million dollars a mile a million
 
03:07:03.550 --> 03:07:03.560 align:start position:0%
dollars a mile so I just want to know if
 
03:07:05.510 --> 03:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
it changed at all it's likely higher
 
03:07:08.229 --> 03:07:08.239 align:start position:0%
than that but likely higher thank
 
03:07:10.630 --> 03:07:10.640 align:start position:0%
you thank you represent representative
 
03:07:14.469 --> 03:07:14.479 align:start position:0%
Abbott please yes um as my memory serves
 
03:07:16.710 --> 03:07:16.720 align:start position:0%
me right there is a lifespan on these
 
03:07:19.429 --> 03:07:19.439 align:start position:0%
sound barries too is that correct
 
03:07:22.429 --> 03:07:22.439 align:start position:0%
correct however we have um I don't know
 
03:07:25.309 --> 03:07:25.319 align:start position:0%
if any of you have driven down uh i93
 
03:07:27.349 --> 03:07:27.359 align:start position:0%
lately we've actually just started
 
03:07:29.590 --> 03:07:29.600 align:start position:0%
installing uh we changed our no current
 
03:07:32.389 --> 03:07:32.399 align:start position:0%
noise barrier design to a one with a
 
03:07:35.630 --> 03:07:35.640 align:start position:0%
concrete uh panel rather than a wood
 
03:07:38.150 --> 03:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
panel and one of the main reasons behind
 
03:07:39.710 --> 03:07:39.720 align:start position:0%
that is it does have a longer life
 
03:07:42.389 --> 03:07:42.399 align:start position:0%
expectancy we believe it to be about in
 
03:07:44.750 --> 03:07:44.760 align:start position:0%
the in the ballpark of 100 years versus
 
03:07:48.510 --> 03:07:48.520 align:start position:0%
the uh the the wood panels are 25 to 30
 
03:07:51.070 --> 03:07:51.080 align:start position:0%
years so thank
 
03:07:55.550 --> 03:07:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:58.110 --> 03:07:58.120 align:start position:0%
fauler can you help me understand who it
 
03:08:00.389 --> 03:08:00.399 align:start position:0%
is who's going to be buying these
 
03:08:02.910 --> 03:08:02.920 align:start position:0%
credits is
 
03:08:05.309 --> 03:08:05.319 align:start position:0%
it my imagination is that the
 
03:08:07.670 --> 03:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
municipality needs to provide a
 
03:08:10.590 --> 03:08:10.600 align:start position:0%
match of say a million
 
03:08:12.750 --> 03:08:12.760 align:start position:0%
dollars and if we can buy a million
 
03:08:15.870 --> 03:08:15.880 align:start position:0%
dollars worth of toll credits for half a
 
03:08:18.349 --> 03:08:18.359 align:start position:0%
million then
 
03:08:22.550 --> 03:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:24.990 --> 03:08:25.000 align:start position:0%
really does that increase or decrease
 
03:08:28.110 --> 03:08:28.120 align:start position:0%
the amount of of construction that we
 
03:08:29.550 --> 03:08:29.560 align:start position:0%
can actually do in the state of the you
 
03:08:33.229 --> 03:08:33.239 align:start position:0%
know total Municipal and state
 
03:08:35.990 --> 03:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
level uh from from from the municipal
 
03:08:38.630 --> 03:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
side or the the or the state side
 
03:08:41.710 --> 03:08:41.720 align:start position:0%
whoever is whoever is buying toll
 
03:08:43.750 --> 03:08:43.760 align:start position:0%
credits or what do they right how is
 
03:08:45.990 --> 03:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
that an advantage and are they able to
 
03:08:48.309 --> 03:08:48.319 align:start position:0%
build more right as a result of this
 
03:08:50.590 --> 03:08:50.600 align:start position:0%
program I think the advantage it's it's
 
03:08:52.469 --> 03:08:52.479 align:start position:0%
like it's like you know some some of the
 
03:08:54.870 --> 03:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
advantage to New Hampshire we we have
 
03:08:59.510 --> 03:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
had um uh we have been fortunate in the
 
03:09:02.429 --> 03:09:02.439 align:start position:0%
past 10 years or so to have a very um
 
03:09:06.269 --> 03:09:06.279 align:start position:0%
robust Turnpike Capital program um and
 
03:09:09.510 --> 03:09:09.520 align:start position:0%
and that has has generated uh uh a
 
03:09:10.910 --> 03:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
sufficient amount of Turnpike toll
 
03:09:14.110 --> 03:09:14.120 align:start position:0%
credits where we don't put very much if
 
03:09:16.950 --> 03:09:16.960 align:start position:0%
any state funds in to match our federal
 
03:09:19.990 --> 03:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
program so we match all of our most all
 
03:09:22.349 --> 03:09:22.359 align:start position:0%
of our federal dollars we use Turnpike
 
03:09:25.429 --> 03:09:25.439 align:start position:0%
toll credits to to to meet the federal
 
03:09:31.229 --> 03:09:31.239 align:start position:0%
match requirement so um on on on the one
 
03:09:33.550 --> 03:09:33.560 align:start position:0%
on the one hand uh you know from a
 
03:09:35.510 --> 03:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
budget perspective and and we're coming
 
03:09:37.710 --> 03:09:37.720 align:start position:0%
up on budget budget season next year and
 
03:09:42.190 --> 03:09:42.200 align:start position:0%
stuff you know that that takes care of
 
03:09:44.910 --> 03:09:44.920 align:start position:0%
you know this past year FY 23 we used
 
03:09:47.590 --> 03:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
$49 million of of of Turnpike toll
 
03:09:49.269 --> 03:09:49.279 align:start position:0%
credit to match our federal program
 
03:09:52.469 --> 03:09:52.479 align:start position:0%
that's $50 million of State funds that
 
03:09:54.870 --> 03:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
we didn't have to find in a budget
 
03:09:58.349 --> 03:09:58.359 align:start position:0%
somewhere to enable um our federal
 
03:10:01.150 --> 03:10:01.160 align:start position:0%
program to go to go forward so that's on
 
03:10:03.910 --> 03:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
on the one hand on the other hand it
 
03:10:06.870 --> 03:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
also means we did if if if we had
 
03:10:09.309 --> 03:10:09.319 align:start position:0%
matched that Federal program with with
 
03:10:11.750 --> 03:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
with Hard Cash instead of toll credits
 
03:10:13.710 --> 03:10:13.720 align:start position:0%
we would have done $50
 
03:10:17.990 --> 03:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
million more work so it's it's it's uh
 
03:10:19.469 --> 03:10:19.479 align:start position:0%
you know depending where the priorities
 
03:10:23.550 --> 03:10:23.560 align:start position:0%
and needs and and and things are as that
 
03:10:25.269 --> 03:10:25.279 align:start position:0%
as far as who would use them I mean I
 
03:10:26.349 --> 03:10:26.359 align:start position:0%
know for
 
03:10:31.110 --> 03:10:31.120 align:start position:0%
example um again we uh you know New
 
03:10:34.269 --> 03:10:34.279 align:start position:0%
Jersey has has has a very you know
 
03:10:36.830 --> 03:10:36.840 align:start position:0%
robust Turnpike program they have a lot
 
03:10:39.710 --> 03:10:39.720 align:start position:0%
of Turnpike toll credits um they would
 
03:10:42.269 --> 03:10:42.279 align:start position:0%
be we would be potentially sellers there
 
03:10:44.910 --> 03:10:44.920 align:start position:0%
are states like Vermont that have no
 
03:10:46.950 --> 03:10:46.960 align:start position:0%
Turnpike uh program they have a lot of
 
03:10:46.960 --> 03:10:47.750 align:start position:0%
Turnpike uh program they have a lot of
federal

03:10:47.750 --> 03:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
federal
 
03:10:51.510 --> 03:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
and I know you know one of Vermont's um
 
03:10:54.550 --> 03:10:54.560 align:start position:0%
challenges has been
 
03:10:57.469 --> 03:10:57.479 align:start position:0%
um uh raising enough State funds to be
 
03:11:00.309 --> 03:11:00.319 align:start position:0%
able to meet their um Federal match
 
03:11:02.389 --> 03:11:02.399 align:start position:0%
requirements and Avail themselves of all
 
03:11:04.630 --> 03:11:04.640 align:start position:0%
of their available federal funds because
 
03:11:06.269 --> 03:11:06.279 align:start position:0%
they don't their challenge is they don't
 
03:11:07.710 --> 03:11:07.720 align:start position:0%
have enough State funds to match the
 
03:11:10.750 --> 03:11:10.760 align:start position:0%
federal dollars so a state like Vermont
 
03:11:13.190 --> 03:11:13.200 align:start position:0%
potentially you know purchasing Turnpike
 
03:11:16.309 --> 03:11:16.319 align:start position:0%
toll credits would be um of Interest
 
03:11:18.190 --> 03:11:18.200 align:start position:0%
particularly if they could
 
03:11:21.070 --> 03:11:21.080 align:start position:0%
would acquire them for 80 cents on the
 
03:11:23.670 --> 03:11:23.680 align:start position:0%
dollar or something like that so
 
03:11:25.510 --> 03:11:25.520 align:start position:0%
hopefully that answers your
 
03:11:28.590 --> 03:11:28.600 align:start position:0%
question yeah fur further questions yes
 
03:11:31.630 --> 03:11:31.640 align:start position:0%
please representative Newman yes uh
 
03:11:34.630 --> 03:11:34.640 align:start position:0%
thank you you mentioned earlier you got
 
03:11:38.510 --> 03:11:38.520 align:start position:0%
to look at a decibel versus a density
 
03:11:45.389 --> 03:11:45.399 align:start position:0%
situation is that's a federal um uh
 
03:11:48.349 --> 03:11:48.359 align:start position:0%
standard uh
 
03:11:51.670 --> 03:11:51.680 align:start position:0%
tell me if I do it wrong it's uh F the
 
03:11:54.030 --> 03:11:54.040 align:start position:0%
federal doesn't establish a standard
 
03:11:57.110 --> 03:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
they require us to have a a a policy now
 
03:12:00.229 --> 03:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
there are federal standards on the um on
 
03:12:01.550 --> 03:12:01.560 align:start position:0%
the deciel
 
03:12:05.790 --> 03:12:05.800 align:start position:0%
threshold um we set our own
 
03:12:08.349 --> 03:12:08.359 align:start position:0%
reasonable criteria which which gets
 
03:12:11.229 --> 03:12:11.239 align:start position:0%
into the which gets into the density
 
03:12:12.870 --> 03:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
okay so and I I know I've testified in
 
03:12:15.150 --> 03:12:15.160 align:start position:0%
the past in our past review of other
 
03:12:18.110 --> 03:12:18.120 align:start position:0%
states policies you know New Hampshire
 
03:12:19.389 --> 03:12:19.399 align:start position:0%
is we
 
03:12:22.469 --> 03:12:22.479 align:start position:0%
are pretty well in the middle of of the
 
03:12:24.950 --> 03:12:24.960 align:start position:0%
pack I know there are other states like
 
03:12:27.750 --> 03:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
um Maryland comes to mind which has a
 
03:12:32.150 --> 03:12:32.160 align:start position:0%
very uh a lower threshold and they're um
 
03:12:34.830 --> 03:12:34.840 align:start position:0%
they build a lot more sound walls Maine
 
03:12:38.309 --> 03:12:38.319 align:start position:0%
has a much higher threshold and uh if
 
03:12:40.429 --> 03:12:40.439 align:start position:0%
you if you drive up the Maine Turnpike
 
03:12:45.229 --> 03:12:45.239 align:start position:0%
or or or Road there um it's it's very
 
03:12:46.670 --> 03:12:46.680 align:start position:0%
difficult to meet their threshold they
 
03:12:48.070 --> 03:12:48.080 align:start position:0%
they they
 
03:12:53.750 --> 03:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
they build very few sound walls um so um
 
03:12:56.550 --> 03:12:56.560 align:start position:0%
so we by policy have established kind of
 
03:12:59.830 --> 03:12:59.840 align:start position:0%
a middle of the road um reasonableness
 
03:13:02.510 --> 03:13:02.520 align:start position:0%
criteria the decibel criteria is
 
03:13:04.990 --> 03:13:05.000 align:start position:0%
established by federal requirements is
 
03:13:08.229 --> 03:13:08.239 align:start position:0%
that right yeah correct I apologize I
 
03:13:10.630 --> 03:13:10.640 align:start position:0%
used the wrong word policy because I can
 
03:13:13.349 --> 03:13:13.359 align:start position:0%
I have in my memory here I can remember
 
03:13:16.590 --> 03:13:16.600 align:start position:0%
hearing about this and and it was very
 
03:13:20.349 --> 03:13:20.359 align:start position:0%
detailed and I mean a lot of you all put
 
03:13:22.150 --> 03:13:22.160 align:start position:0%
a lot of thought into the whole thing
 
03:13:25.309 --> 03:13:25.319 align:start position:0%
when you put it out I'm going to depend
 
03:13:29.229 --> 03:13:29.239 align:start position:0%
on your memories also several I'm
 
03:13:31.910 --> 03:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
thinking several years ago I remember a
 
03:13:34.269 --> 03:13:34.279 align:start position:0%
woman coming in she was from the Sea
 
03:13:36.349 --> 03:13:36.359 align:start position:0%
Coast Area and they had been waiting
 
03:13:40.510 --> 03:13:40.520 align:start position:0%
some 30 years for sound barriers and you
 
03:13:44.870 --> 03:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
know and she um just say if everything
 
03:13:48.269 --> 03:13:48.279 align:start position:0%
was perfect whatever where would that
 
03:13:51.110 --> 03:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
situation be waiting for over 30 years
 
03:13:54.429 --> 03:13:54.439 align:start position:0%
now compared to T Berry Lane would one
 
03:13:56.710 --> 03:13:56.720 align:start position:0%
be ahead of
 
03:13:56.720 --> 03:14:00.630 align:start position:0%
be ahead of
another

03:14:00.630 --> 03:14:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:03.309 --> 03:14:03.319 align:start position:0%
um it might depend on the the location
 
03:14:07.030 --> 03:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
in Portsmouth but um if it's we're
 
03:14:10.950 --> 03:14:10.960 align:start position:0%
actually we're in the process of of uh
 
03:14:13.030 --> 03:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
we'll be uh advertising a project to
 
03:14:15.150 --> 03:14:15.160 align:start position:0%
build two sound barriers in Portsmith
 
03:14:18.510 --> 03:14:18.520 align:start position:0%
okay uh that will advertise next month
 
03:14:20.790 --> 03:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
um and it's probably the the
 
03:14:22.309 --> 03:14:22.319 align:start position:0%
neighborhood that you're thinking of
 
03:14:25.030 --> 03:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
it's the The panaway Manor neighborhood
 
03:14:29.670 --> 03:14:29.680 align:start position:0%
in okay thank you for the good M and so
 
03:14:32.030 --> 03:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
that was ranked I believe it was
 
03:14:38.750 --> 03:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:42.030 --> 03:14:42.040 align:start position:0%
of I can't find it right off hand but
 
03:14:44.550 --> 03:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
it's it was up there it was probably
 
03:14:48.349 --> 03:14:48.359 align:start position:0%
number it was in the top 10 or so list
 
03:14:51.630 --> 03:14:51.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:51.640 --> 03:14:53.550 align:start position:0%
 
is

03:14:53.550 --> 03:14:53.560 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:14:56.630 --> 03:14:56.640 align:start position:0%
106 and I would say it's not by the um
 
03:14:59.190 --> 03:14:59.200 align:start position:0%
by the age or the time there it's
 
03:15:00.870 --> 03:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
usually it's categorized by by
 
03:15:03.349 --> 03:15:03.359 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness and Effectiveness is is
 
03:15:07.790 --> 03:15:07.800 align:start position:0%
kind of more of a um measure of of of um
 
03:15:10.990 --> 03:15:11.000 align:start position:0%
reasonableness you know we've ranked and
 
03:15:14.630 --> 03:15:14.640 align:start position:0%
prioritize things by um by the best cost
 
03:15:16.389 --> 03:15:16.399 align:start position:0%
benefit so the highest benefit for the
 
03:15:20.910 --> 03:15:20.920 align:start position:0%
least cost is is what would rank highest
 
03:15:23.590 --> 03:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
as we've ranked it yeah it might also
 
03:15:25.590 --> 03:15:25.600 align:start position:0%
help for you to understand too that
 
03:15:26.990 --> 03:15:27.000 align:start position:0%
these are
 
03:15:28.990 --> 03:15:29.000 align:start position:0%
um these are
 
03:15:31.150 --> 03:15:31.160 align:start position:0%
preliminary there there's as as the
 
03:15:33.150 --> 03:15:33.160 align:start position:0%
commissioner said earlier there's
 
03:15:34.910 --> 03:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
eligibility requirements that have to be
 
03:15:36.790 --> 03:15:36.800 align:start position:0%
met for just the municipalities to even
 
03:15:41.189 --> 03:15:41.199 align:start position:0%
be able to do this um so you know just
 
03:15:43.670 --> 03:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
because it says you know say they're n
 
03:15:45.590 --> 03:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
you know you have one number seven
 
03:15:48.469 --> 03:15:48.479 align:start position:0%
versus 106 doesn't mean there may be
 
03:15:50.189 --> 03:15:50.199 align:start position:0%
some municipalities that say you know
 
03:15:51.510 --> 03:15:51.520 align:start position:0%
what we don't want to participate in
 
03:15:53.910 --> 03:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
this program so the rank may actually be
 
03:15:55.750 --> 03:15:55.760 align:start position:0%
higher because those
 
03:15:58.269 --> 03:15:58.279 align:start position:0%
communities uh don't want to participate
 
03:16:00.630 --> 03:16:00.640 align:start position:0%
they don't they don't want to you know
 
03:16:02.070 --> 03:16:02.080 align:start position:0%
meet some of the requirements of the
 
03:16:07.070 --> 03:16:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:10.269 --> 03:16:10.279 align:start position:0%
program represent Mills please I I just
 
03:16:11.790 --> 03:16:11.800 align:start position:0%
we're getting close to winding this down
 
03:16:13.189 --> 03:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
here just one last thing I just wanted
 
03:16:16.950 --> 03:16:16.960 align:start position:0%
to if you could recap very quickly the
 
03:16:18.790 --> 03:16:18.800 align:start position:0%
the things that you've already done in
 
03:16:21.070 --> 03:16:21.080 align:start position:0%
tberry Lane here if I remember correctly
 
03:16:23.870 --> 03:16:23.880 align:start position:0%
you've already put up Vegeta you've put
 
03:16:27.110 --> 03:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
up BMS you put up Earth and BMS you've
 
03:16:30.309 --> 03:16:30.319 align:start position:0%
done uh sound barrier plantings things
 
03:16:32.229 --> 03:16:32.239 align:start position:0%
like that and I I guess it was kind of
 
03:16:33.910 --> 03:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
news to me that you've already put up
 
03:16:35.990 --> 03:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
some kind of a wooden sound barrier also
 
03:16:39.750 --> 03:16:39.760 align:start position:0%
just so that the uh committee knows this
 
03:16:41.790 --> 03:16:41.800 align:start position:0%
yeah no the concerns about tberry I mean
 
03:16:44.269 --> 03:16:44.279 align:start position:0%
we we've we've we've taken them you know
 
03:16:45.830 --> 03:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
real I I agree with everything the
 
03:16:47.229 --> 03:16:47.239 align:start position:0%
senator said I've stood in those
 
03:16:50.670 --> 03:16:50.680 align:start position:0%
backyards and it is and it is noisy um
 
03:16:52.389 --> 03:16:52.399 align:start position:0%
number of years ago when it first came
 
03:16:54.590 --> 03:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
up we couldn't build a sound wall but we
 
03:16:57.269 --> 03:16:57.279 align:start position:0%
could build a a you know a stockade
 
03:17:00.150 --> 03:17:00.160 align:start position:0%
fence for at least a privacy type of uh
 
03:17:02.630 --> 03:17:02.640 align:start position:0%
thing um she's right The Stockade Fence
 
03:17:06.150 --> 03:17:06.160 align:start position:0%
has since deteriorated or or or or um
 
03:17:08.389 --> 03:17:08.399 align:start position:0%
you know had trees falling on it and and
 
03:17:11.349 --> 03:17:11.359 align:start position:0%
stuff maintaining that Stockade Fence
 
03:17:15.030 --> 03:17:15.040 align:start position:0%
has been um you know a a a challenge
 
03:17:15.040 --> 03:17:15.830 align:start position:0%
has been um you know a a a challenge
it's

03:17:15.830 --> 03:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
it's
 
03:17:15.840 --> 03:17:17.750 align:start position:0%
it's
not

03:17:17.750 --> 03:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
not
 
03:17:19.950 --> 03:17:19.960 align:start position:0%
you know our guys are typically focus on
 
03:17:21.710 --> 03:17:21.720 align:start position:0%
the roadway and plowing the roadway and
 
03:17:23.590 --> 03:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
fixing the guard rail and then add off
 
03:17:25.990 --> 03:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
100 feet off the road looking at the
 
03:17:28.389 --> 03:17:28.399 align:start position:0%
looking at the fence so um it has fallen
 
03:17:30.630 --> 03:17:30.640 align:start position:0%
into disrepair most recently because of
 
03:17:32.349 --> 03:17:32.359 align:start position:0%
the current concern we have worked with
 
03:17:35.750 --> 03:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
them and um it took a little bit of uh
 
03:17:38.429 --> 03:17:38.439 align:start position:0%
doing and permitting because we had some
 
03:17:40.670 --> 03:17:40.680 align:start position:0%
um additional Wetland impacts we are
 
03:17:42.990 --> 03:17:43.000 align:start position:0%
looking at building a small burm closer
 
03:17:46.189 --> 03:17:46.199 align:start position:0%
up toward the highway and a more robust
 
03:17:49.870 --> 03:17:49.880 align:start position:0%
stockade fence um closer to the highway
 
03:17:53.269 --> 03:17:53.279 align:start position:0%
on on on a burm so that it is uh you
 
03:17:55.030 --> 03:17:55.040 align:start position:0%
know closer to Highway a better chance
 
03:17:56.910 --> 03:17:56.920 align:start position:0%
of it being maintained and certainly
 
03:18:00.070 --> 03:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
more um robust again we we've said it's
 
03:18:02.189 --> 03:18:02.199 align:start position:0%
not it may have
 
03:18:05.630 --> 03:18:05.640 align:start position:0%
some noise benefit but it's but it's not
 
03:18:07.229 --> 03:18:07.239 align:start position:0%
dense enough it's not thick enough it's
 
03:18:09.990 --> 03:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
not it's it's not um a noise mitigation
 
03:18:12.150 --> 03:18:12.160 align:start position:0%
but it will address some of the privacy
 
03:18:13.990 --> 03:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
and at least cut the cut the line of
 
03:18:15.990 --> 03:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
sight so we've tried to do what we can
 
03:18:17.670 --> 03:18:17.680 align:start position:0%
to address that and that will be going
 
03:18:20.070 --> 03:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
forward but thank you you're welcome
 
03:18:24.110 --> 03:18:24.120 align:start position:0%
thank you U if if I go ahead
 
03:18:25.670 --> 03:18:25.680 align:start position:0%
representative you know I've been
 
03:18:27.349 --> 03:18:27.359 align:start position:0%
sitting here thank you for taking my
 
03:18:29.950 --> 03:18:29.960 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman I've been
 
03:18:31.229 --> 03:18:31.239 align:start position:0%
sitting here listening to this
 
03:18:34.030 --> 03:18:34.040 align:start position:0%
conversation it seems to have gone in a
 
03:18:35.990 --> 03:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
circle it almost seems to me like this
 
03:18:37.590 --> 03:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
bill says one thing and you're trying to
 
03:18:40.349 --> 03:18:40.359 align:start position:0%
do another with it
 
03:18:43.910 --> 03:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
um do people get a false hope that by
 
03:18:45.550 --> 03:18:45.560 align:start position:0%
putting a sound barrier up they're going
 
03:18:47.309 --> 03:18:47.319 align:start position:0%
to be able to sit out there and read
 
03:18:50.269 --> 03:18:50.279 align:start position:0%
book you know you put some up and and
 
03:18:52.590 --> 03:18:52.600 align:start position:0%
recent most recently the watchest the
 
03:18:54.349 --> 03:18:54.359 align:start position:0%
toll booth you put some up and I heard
 
03:18:57.110 --> 03:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
from a constituent this morning I live
 
03:18:59.670 --> 03:18:59.680 align:start position:0%
basically through the woods from there
 
03:19:01.389 --> 03:19:01.399 align:start position:0%
and they said it's just as noisy as ever
 
03:19:03.070 --> 03:19:03.080 align:start position:0%
in fact it was quieter when the trees
 
03:19:05.269 --> 03:19:05.279 align:start position:0%
were there but now the barrier is up in
 
03:19:07.830 --> 03:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
a lot of areas so you know are you
 
03:19:09.750 --> 03:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
getting feedback once you do a barrier
 
03:19:11.950 --> 03:19:11.960 align:start position:0%
that people love it or they say boy this
 
03:19:14.030 --> 03:19:14.040 align:start position:0%
really didn't help much or seems like a
 
03:19:17.229 --> 03:19:17.239 align:start position:0%
lot of money to spend for maybe not
 
03:19:18.830 --> 03:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
taking care of the
 
03:19:21.950 --> 03:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
problem um John you can speak a little
 
03:19:23.990 --> 03:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
bit further but they are effective to to
 
03:19:27.710 --> 03:19:27.720 align:start position:0%
the to the to the uh to the houses or
 
03:19:30.309 --> 03:19:30.319 align:start position:0%
The receptors that that benefit from it
 
03:19:32.510 --> 03:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
um it won't benefit everybody there are
 
03:19:35.349 --> 03:19:35.359 align:start position:0%
ones further away from the um sound
 
03:19:37.750 --> 03:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
barrier that won't receive the benefit
 
03:19:40.189 --> 03:19:40.199 align:start position:0%
um but that is a thing and and in
 
03:19:43.950 --> 03:19:43.960 align:start position:0%
Rochester I know um because it did it
 
03:19:46.990 --> 03:19:47.000 align:start position:0%
did come up as part of this part part of
 
03:19:49.630 --> 03:19:49.640 align:start position:0%
this discussion around this bill I know
 
03:19:51.590 --> 03:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
Senator richardi had concerns about
 
03:19:53.950 --> 03:19:53.960 align:start position:0%
tberry Lane I think several other
 
03:19:58.590 --> 03:19:58.600 align:start position:0%
senators were aware of um uh other noise
 
03:20:02.110 --> 03:20:02.120 align:start position:0%
issues in in their uh districts I know
 
03:20:04.269 --> 03:20:04.279 align:start position:0%
Senator gray had has had similar
 
03:20:06.790 --> 03:20:06.800 align:start position:0%
concerns about the sound barriers in
 
03:20:10.590 --> 03:20:10.600 align:start position:0%
Rochester um and um I think that's why
 
03:20:14.790 --> 03:20:14.800 align:start position:0%
this bill morphed into a more um General
 
03:20:17.510 --> 03:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
type of Bill to find a way to fund or
 
03:20:20.830 --> 03:20:20.840 align:start position:0%
potentially fund a type 2 noise barrier
 
03:20:24.070 --> 03:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
program um I'm I don't know if I'm
 
03:20:26.469 --> 03:20:26.479 align:start position:0%
answering your question directly but um
 
03:20:28.790 --> 03:20:28.800 align:start position:0%
that is part of the history the the the
 
03:20:29.830 --> 03:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
one in
 
03:20:33.510 --> 03:20:33.520 align:start position:0%
Rochester um there are some it's very
 
03:20:35.830 --> 03:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
it's very similar to tberry lane or or
 
03:20:37.910 --> 03:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
very similar to areas along the F ever
 
03:20:39.790 --> 03:20:39.800 align:start position:0%
Turnpike where there are some
 
03:20:41.990 --> 03:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods that meet the density
 
03:20:43.950 --> 03:20:43.960 align:start position:0%
requirements and have a sound sound
 
03:20:47.349 --> 03:20:47.359 align:start position:0%
barrier being built uh and it will be
 
03:20:50.030 --> 03:20:50.040 align:start position:0%
effective for those communities there
 
03:20:52.429 --> 03:20:52.439 align:start position:0%
are a couple other neighborhoods that
 
03:20:54.389 --> 03:20:54.399 align:start position:0%
don't meet the density requirements are
 
03:20:57.950 --> 03:20:57.960 align:start position:0%
not receiving a a noise barrier um and
 
03:20:59.670 --> 03:20:59.680 align:start position:0%
I'm sure you're hearing from those folks
 
03:21:01.269 --> 03:21:01.279 align:start position:0%
that that those are the ones that the
 
03:21:03.830 --> 03:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
noise is as loud as ever
 
03:21:06.110 --> 03:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
so you want to add anything more John
 
03:21:08.070 --> 03:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
sure I can add the the noise barriers
 
03:21:10.389 --> 03:21:10.399 align:start position:0%
we've done you know follow-up studies
 
03:21:12.750 --> 03:21:12.760 align:start position:0%
post construction and and in general
 
03:21:16.389 --> 03:21:16.399 align:start position:0%
they actually uh function better than
 
03:21:19.830 --> 03:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
than and we're originally so in order to
 
03:21:21.429 --> 03:21:21.439 align:start position:0%
determine how much benefit you're going
 
03:21:23.070 --> 03:21:23.080 align:start position:0%
to get from a barrier we actually use a
 
03:21:25.030 --> 03:21:25.040 align:start position:0%
noise model that's required by the
 
03:21:26.790 --> 03:21:26.800 align:start position:0%
Federal Highway Administration because
 
03:21:29.469 --> 03:21:29.479 align:start position:0%
obviously we can't make a decision uh
 
03:21:31.790 --> 03:21:31.800 align:start position:0%
about the effectiveness of a barrier and
 
03:21:33.910 --> 03:21:33.920 align:start position:0%
whether or not it should go in before
 
03:21:35.630 --> 03:21:35.640 align:start position:0%
actually build you know we need to make
 
03:21:37.189 --> 03:21:37.199 align:start position:0%
that decision before we actually build
 
03:21:40.710 --> 03:21:40.720 align:start position:0%
it so we can predict the the noise
 
03:21:43.030 --> 03:21:43.040 align:start position:0%
benefits from a barrier using that model
 
03:21:45.070 --> 03:21:45.080 align:start position:0%
and then and then in actuality it
 
03:21:47.189 --> 03:21:47.199 align:start position:0%
actually produces more benefit
 
03:21:49.630 --> 03:21:49.640 align:start position:0%
a benefit is anything over 5 DB or
 
03:21:53.429 --> 03:21:53.439 align:start position:0%
greater 5 DB is a noticeable difference
 
03:21:55.429 --> 03:21:55.439 align:start position:0%
um and then uh because it's a
 
03:21:58.349 --> 03:21:58.359 align:start position:0%
logarithmic scale approximately 8 to 10
 
03:22:02.590 --> 03:22:02.600 align:start position:0%
DB is half the noise for the first row
 
03:22:05.389 --> 03:22:05.399 align:start position:0%
homes behind a barrier those are the
 
03:22:07.030 --> 03:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
ones that typically get the best the
 
03:22:10.110 --> 03:22:10.120 align:start position:0%
most benefit uh generally we see on the
 
03:22:13.389 --> 03:22:13.399 align:start position:0%
order of a 12 to 15 dbel reduction for
 
03:22:15.630 --> 03:22:15.640 align:start position:0%
those first homes so they are seeing
 
03:22:17.349 --> 03:22:17.359 align:start position:0%
more than half
 
03:22:18.630 --> 03:22:18.640 align:start position:0%
the noise levels they're they're
 
03:22:22.110 --> 03:22:22.120 align:start position:0%
certainly not ever going to see um you
 
03:22:24.870 --> 03:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
know complete silence from for you know
 
03:22:26.590 --> 03:22:26.600 align:start position:0%
we're never going to eliminate the
 
03:22:28.070 --> 03:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
highway traffic noise because it is
 
03:22:29.950 --> 03:22:29.960 align:start position:0%
still there but the idea is to
 
03:22:32.870 --> 03:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
essentially disrupt the flow of noise
 
03:22:34.510 --> 03:22:34.520 align:start position:0%
and in fact really what A noise barrier
 
03:22:38.269 --> 03:22:38.279 align:start position:0%
is it noise dissipates over distance and
 
03:22:41.269 --> 03:22:41.279 align:start position:0%
so if you put a noise barrier up and the
 
03:22:43.309 --> 03:22:43.319 align:start position:0%
noise can't get through it has to travel
 
03:22:46.189 --> 03:22:46.199 align:start position:0%
a further distance to get to the to the
 
03:22:46.199 --> 03:22:47.269 align:start position:0%
a further distance to get to the to the
the

03:22:47.269 --> 03:22:47.279 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:22:49.349 --> 03:22:49.359 align:start position:0%
adjacent homes and that is what's
 
03:22:52.510 --> 03:22:52.520 align:start position:0%
causing the noise reduction so just by
 
03:22:54.550 --> 03:22:54.560 align:start position:0%
putting in that barrier you you will get
 
03:22:57.070 --> 03:22:57.080 align:start position:0%
a noise reduction from from that but
 
03:22:58.429 --> 03:22:58.439 align:start position:0%
again it's not going to completely
 
03:23:02.870 --> 03:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
eliminate it thank you thank you um one
 
03:23:06.429 --> 03:23:06.439 align:start position:0%
one more question from myself if I
 
03:23:11.189 --> 03:23:11.199 align:start position:0%
could so it's policy to use toll credits
 
03:23:13.590 --> 03:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
when necessary to fund a project but I
 
03:23:16.990 --> 03:23:17.000 align:start position:0%
would think most of that is is a Highway
 
03:23:19.950 --> 03:23:19.960 align:start position:0%
project correct asphalt concrete those
 
03:23:22.309 --> 03:23:22.319 align:start position:0%
sort of things and it would seem to me
 
03:23:24.790 --> 03:23:24.800 align:start position:0%
that sound barriers while they're very
 
03:23:28.030 --> 03:23:28.040 align:start position:0%
necessary and the people living
 
03:23:31.469 --> 03:23:31.479 align:start position:0%
alongside um for the enjoyment of their
 
03:23:34.389 --> 03:23:34.399 align:start position:0%
property I can understand that but I it
 
03:23:36.389 --> 03:23:36.399 align:start position:0%
would seem to me that this is an
 
03:23:39.349 --> 03:23:39.359 align:start position:0%
anciliary use of those
 
03:23:42.870 --> 03:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
monies um and
 
03:23:45.750 --> 03:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
um Mr Evans if if this is your only
 
03:23:47.550 --> 03:23:47.560 align:start position:0%
charge I would think you should might
 
03:23:49.510 --> 03:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
want to move into another department on
 
03:23:51.750 --> 03:23:51.760 align:start position:0%
how you're going to fund these
 
03:23:55.309 --> 03:23:55.319 align:start position:0%
things um I'll find plenty of work from
 
03:23:56.710 --> 03:23:56.720 align:start position:0%
elsewhere if
 
03:24:00.590 --> 03:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
that's I and um when when I saw and i'
 
03:24:02.469 --> 03:24:02.479 align:start position:0%
I've been through this many times as
 
03:24:04.429 --> 03:24:04.439 align:start position:0%
rent Mills is you know when you start
 
03:24:06.670 --> 03:24:06.680 align:start position:0%
seeing that list turn into two pages
 
03:24:08.870 --> 03:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
there there's a tremendous need we just
 
03:24:11.070 --> 03:24:11.080 align:start position:0%
don't apparently have the the way to
 
03:24:14.349 --> 03:24:14.359 align:start position:0%
fund that at this point in time um any
 
03:24:17.510 --> 03:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
further questions from the Department
 
03:24:20.030 --> 03:24:20.040 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you so much for your
 
03:24:23.670 --> 03:24:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:26.670 --> 03:24:26.680 align:start position:0%
you so for the committee we are going to
 
03:24:31.269 --> 03:24:31.279 align:start position:0%
have to Blue sheet uh thank you Kathleen
 
03:24:34.870 --> 03:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
heck U New Hampshire Municipal
 
03:24:37.469 --> 03:24:37.479 align:start position:0%
Association uh signed in in
 
03:24:41.349 --> 03:24:41.359 align:start position:0%
favor uh we are going to need to convene
 
03:24:44.630 --> 03:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
to exec the um the other Bill we had
 
03:24:46.830 --> 03:24:46.840 align:start position:0%
earlier the naming bill so we might as
 
03:24:50.510 --> 03:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
well hold off on this until that time
 
03:24:53.030 --> 03:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
and as soon as we get an indication on
 
03:24:55.309 --> 03:24:55.319 align:start position:0%
when that letter is going to be
 
03:24:59.469 --> 03:24:59.479 align:start position:0%
forthcoming um we'll do that schedule so
 
03:25:01.269 --> 03:25:01.279 align:start position:0%
I don't have any other business anyone
 
03:25:03.030 --> 03:25:03.040 align:start position:0%
have any questions on the committee at
 
03:25:04.349 --> 03:25:04.359 align:start position:0%
this point in
 
03:25:07.469 --> 03:25:07.479 align:start position:0%
time Mr chair do you expect other Senate
 
03:25:09.229 --> 03:25:09.239 align:start position:0%
bills that we will get Senate bills as
 
03:25:13.030 --> 03:25:13.040 align:start position:0%
of today um I I believe this is what we
 
03:25:15.429 --> 03:25:15.439 align:start position:0%
have in our in our I don't know what
 
03:25:17.030 --> 03:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
what else is coming
 
03:25:21.510 --> 03:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you we are uh we are told um
 
03:25:23.429 --> 03:25:23.439 align:start position:0%
that by next week we should be back in
 
03:25:26.750 --> 03:25:26.760 align:start position:0%
our committee room great and as exciting
 
03:25:28.790 --> 03:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
as that is I've been told three times we
 
03:25:30.790 --> 03:25:30.800 align:start position:0%
were going to be there so say I heard
 
03:25:32.510 --> 03:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
that before I think I'll believe it when
 
03:25:35.189 --> 03:25:35.199 align:start position:0%
I see so uh thank you all for finding
 
03:25:38.309 --> 03:25:38.319 align:start position:0%
your way here and we'll see you tomorrow
 
03:25:40.349 --> 03:25:40.359 align:start position:0%
uh in rep's
 
03:25:45.229 --> 03:25:45.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:45.239 --> 03:26:15.229 align:start position:0%
 
you

03:26:15.229 --> 03:26:15.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:15.239 --> 03:26:18.239 align:start position:0%
